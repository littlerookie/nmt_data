is that true?
you tell me. - You tell me.
no, you tell me is that true! - No, you tell me!
you look me in the eye, and you tell me if you're still in love with me.
Hey, you two.
Hey, Javier. What's up?
I just wanted to talk to you.
I know we're not together anymore, but...
I still think you're incredibly talented.
uh, yeah. Yeah, definitely...
no, well, the offer for you to go on tour with me still stands.
what? Really?
you're good, Adrianna.
you should do it, Ade.
Yeah, it's a huge opportunity, and what better way to spend your summer?
Hey, I can go with you. - Really?
Yeah, we could spend it together.
my tour's not a summer tour. It's a whole year.
well, I'm still in school.
and why do people go to school?
to get the education they need to get the job of their dreams.
Adrianna, this is your dream, right here, right now.
I know it's not the safe move, but come on.
take a risk.
maybe.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh... hey, Mr. Cannon.
um, my car won't start.
who knew that could be a problem in the modern era, right?
apparently there are cars that don't start.
and my cell phone died,so I just,um, need to borrow someone's phone to call AAA.
I didn't know it was you here, so...
is everything okay, Naomi?
no, it's not.
everything is not okay.
everything is wrong.
and it's all my fault.
because I'm self-centered.
I'm a liar.
I'm a terrible person.
no. No, you're not a terrible person.
how can you say that? I almost ruined your life.
but you didn't.
would you like a glass of water?
Yeah.
are you sure you don't want me to go in with you?
I have to do this alone.
well, I'm sleeping on my boat, um, you know, to enjoy my last night of freedom.
I don't know if I'll get cell reception out there, but if you need me, you know where to find me.
thank you.
mom, Dad, I have something that I have to tell you.
Mr. The animal kingdom is brutal.
but no animal is as brutal as the Homo sapien.
anyway, it goes on and on and on like that.
well, it's an amazing project.
I'm really impressed, seriously.
Oh, well, I'm, I'm glad. So, um...
I'm not just some boring, old bastard, then?
of course not. No.
I mean, you're talented.
Ah, you're just saying that.
no.
thank you.
means a lot to me.
well, it's seems like a very important documentary.
thank you.
you don't mind me holding your hand, do you?
no, that's... no. It's fine.
I should probably call AAA though,because...
Mr. Cannon!
Oh, come on. It's okay.
I know you wanted me to kiss you. You don't have to feel guilty.
what? I don't feel guilty.
I don't want you to kiss me.
enough, Naomi.
enough with the teasing.
I see the way you look at me.
and your whole harassment fantasy?
you're trying to provoke me.
and now that you have, you're going to play the innocent?
don't bother.
I know you want me to.
get away from me, you perv.
stop it! Stop or I will tell. Stop!
who're you going to tell?
who're you going to tell, hmm?
who's going to believe you?
you're the girl who cried wolf.
it was fun being married.
clinica Sanando. - Anna Paul, please.
Dr. Paul passed away two weeks ago.
there were some kids playing.
their ball went into the street.
I didn't even see the car.
you gonna turn that off?
how long you been here?
a while. But I didn't want to wake you.
is that why you've come back from the, uh...from the great beyond -- to watch your ex-husband sleep?
Hey, where do you go when you're not here?
I don't know. I'm here, and then I'm gone.
and if I were in control, I would not choose to show up and watch you have a nightmare.
who says I had a nightmare?
you tossed and turned a bit.
what was it about?
I was at the clinic, and I knew I had a patient, so I walked from room to room, but I... I couldn't find anyone.
and then?
then I found a man.
he was about my age, looked like me.
and he opened his mouth to talk, but...
Michael, do you want to talk?
and his head turned into Kate's, and he told me to get my ass to work, which is what I have to do now.
Hey, next time you drop in to spy on me, could you at least start the coffee?
please?
how'd you get that bruise?
I tried a board-side grind and totally bit it.
think I broke a rib.
and this happened where?
a construction site down the block.
probably with a big "No Trespassing" sign on the fence, right?
take your shirt off. I'm gonna take another look.
you skateboard a lot, Steven?
as much as I can.
this is the first time I really hurt myself.
it must have been some fall, huh?
you don't have to tell my dad or anything, do you?
I mean, if I really broke a rib...
he'd probably stop you from riding.
Yeah.
so, you think the kid's lying?
he's got multiple bruises in different stages of healing, even though he said he just fell.
and his skateboard looks brand new.
what?
once a family doc, always a family doc.
neurosurgeons have eyes, too.
uh, any idea who's beating him up?
he seemed anxious about us talking to his dad.
I have an idea.
Hi. You here for Steven?
Yeah, I'm Ben Tucker.
I just got a call about my son Steven. Is he... Is he okay?
I'm Dr. Kate Sykora. I'm the one who called you, and, uh, Steven's doing fine.
we just can't treat him without your consent, so if you could just sign this.
um, you know, we have insurance, so maybe it's better if I take him to...
a nicer place? Don't worry. He took a tumble off his skateboard.
a few scrapes and bruises. He's gonna be fine. Just sign the form.
great. Have a seat, and I'll get him to you in a couple minutes.
thank you.
could you see his knuckles?
Yeah. Looks like he's been punching somebody.
all right. I'll call the police, and you try and get the real story out of Steven.
what the hell's his problem?
this thing ate my money!
come on! - Sir, take it easy.
go to hell! Mr. Tucker, you need to calm down!
let me go! - Listen, you cut your leg.
dad?
Steven. Let's go back into an exam room.
what's he doing here? Did you call him?
come on. It's okay.
would be fine. Can I just get my son and go?
not unless you want to risk a mother of an infection.
Yeah, you went at that machine pretty hard.
must be, uh, quite the chocoholic.
last couple of months just seems like everything's making me crazy.
things that used to roll off my back just don't anymore.
I don't know what's happening to me.
you told Dr. Holt that you skate all the time, right?
and that you hardly ever fall?
Yeah, I do.
so, um, how come this looks like it's never been used?
I don't know.
feeling stressed? - Yeah, I am that.
I drive a town car for U. N.types, foreign diplomats.
some of 'em are not so easy to deal with.
stress making you punch walls?
Oh, uh, no. I got this changing a flat tire.
so, your dad really lost his temper out there. Does that happen often?
these days, yeah.
before, he was always cool, but...
a few months ago, he just started going off about everything.
and is that how you got these bruises?
you done? Can I get Steven and go?
uh, I need to bandage it up.
uh, this is my wife.
Hi, Julie.
I can help you if you tell me the truth.
he hit me.
this morning?
and last week.
I borrowed his credit card to download some music.
even though he said I could, when he found out, he just lost it.
and you came here so he wouldn't know.
bought the skateboard to back your story.
no. It was just a little accident. I cut my leg.
doctor stitched it up, and now I guess he's gone down the hall looking for something to wrap it with.
well, it's kind of a dump.
doctor's arrogant.
I got to go, honey. He's back.
didn't see me standing there?
no. No, I guess not.
need to check your eyes.
look at me.
any headaches recently?
Yeah. Figured that's what you get when you can't pay your bills.
any problems with your peripheral vision lately?
um, I almost sideswiped a cab yesterday.
Where's "World's Greatest Dad"?
he's back there, but, uh, we have a big problem.
bigger than him hitting his kid?
he needs an emergency MRI.
he'll get one in the jail ward when he's booked.
his loss of vision is recent and could be progressing rapidly. It can't wait.
you want me to take him to County?
there's a quicker option.
and what would that be?
well, I'll give you a hint. It's got lots of windows and your name all over it.
take him to Holt Neuro.
who's this?
who are you?
aren't you a charmer? Just hold your horses.
Hey, get him set up for an MRI.
just follow him.
let me guess. Another patient from your lovely clinic.
he will be in and out.
while your jailbird's having his picture taken, you have a consult in your office.
this one's a VIP.
FDNY Chief John Hawthorne. Says he's having throbbing headaches.
chief Hawthorne.
thanks for making time for me.
this is Gemma Krauss, one of FDNY's bravest. She drove me here.
I told your assistant I was having headaches, but that's not exactly true.
the person you need to take a look at is Gemma.
I'm sorry I had to lie to get you to come here, but you refuse to see a doctor.
Yes, because there's nothing wrong with me.
stopping in the middle of sentences. Can't finish your thoughts.
Gemma, I'm worried about you.
how long has this been going on?
no, he's making a big deal out of nothing.
three months.
she's supposed to start back in active duty next week, but she needs a clean bill of health.
I'll call back for an update.
chief...
chief!
have a seat.
Yeah, I'm sorry. He's, um... He's overreacting.
he and my dad came up together since they were cadets.
he's always been like a second father to me.
he cares, which is nice, but it's also a pain in the ass sometimes.
so this problem you're having-- uh, how often has it happened?
two or three times.
okay, four or five.
and, uh, you have a headache?
dizziness? Numbness? Nausea?
no, no. No.
that's only three.
well, I was nauseous.
but I had the stomach flu.
the department doctor gave me Ondansetron, and it's fine.
take any other medications?
no.
look, since I got injured, I've been on light duty. I've been baby-sitting the chief.
Yeah, I get back on my truck in a week.
I'd still like to run several tests, including a spinal tap.
a spinal tap? But for...
for spacing out?
just want to rule out anything infectious. Firefighters get into some messy situations.
broken sewer mains, contaminants.
Yeah. I know what we go through. But look, I...
I haven't been in a fire in three months.
I can't wait to get...
get
...get-get back... get back to it.
so the chief wasn't imagining anything.
no. But look, once it passes, I'm fine.
not from where I'm sitting.
Dr. Holt, your MRI is up.
let's prep Ms. Kraus for a CT and consent her for a lumbar puncture.
now she's the patient?
stranger things have happened here.
did you figure it out?
you have a type of brain tumor called a meningioma.
the irregular borders suggest it's malignant.
I have a brain tumor?
it's pressing on the amygdala.
that's the part of the brain that controls emotion.
you said you used to be a pretty easy-going guy a few months ago, right?
so when I take it out, the violent outbursts will go away.
all right?
Ben, did you hear what I said?
leave it in.
what? You've got a couple months, tops.
even before then, you could become paralyzed before it kills...
I heard you. I understand.
I want you to let me die.
Ben, you really should reconsider. The surgery can save your life.
Ben! What is going on?
is this your wife?
look, I'm... I'm really sorry, Julie.
why did you hit Steven?
you can talk to him after he's booked-- Third Precinct.
answer me! Why?
Mrs. Tucker. Mrs. Tucker!
look, a few hours ago my husband cut his leg at some clinic, and now he's arrested and brought here. What is going on?!
I can't speak to you about his diagnosis without his permission.
go ahead, tell them.
I'm assuming you've noticed Ben's angry outbursts.
Yeah, it's kind of hard not to.
they're being caused by a brain tumor.
Ben has cancer?
is my dad gonna die?
without treatment, it's certainly fatal.
but if I remove the tumor, he has a good chance of being the person he once was.
so you're going to operate?
no.
why not?
I don't know. Ask him.
E-MO, thanks for joining us.
Hey.
had to meet with an NFL kicker who just got cut because he forgot how to split the uprights.
I have a patient for you.
firefighter who developed neuro symptoms after she was injured a while back-- East 27th Street fire.
the day care? Yeah, I heard about it.
Yeah. Big news. The rest of her workup is normal, but you can do the spinal tap and get her story all at once.
Yeah, well, you know, I love a captive audience.
so, you're a neurologist and a psychiatrist?
I like residency so much, I did it twice.
let me guess.
chief called and added "loony" to my list of problems.
well if it makes you feel any better,
I'm only wearing my neurologist hat right now.
spinal taps are our bread and butter.
so I'm going to be inserting this needle, okay?
Yeah, what am I, five? Just do it already.
this might hurt just a little.
I hear you're one of our bravest.
ladder Company 57.
so you were at the big fire on East 27th a couple of months ago.
day care, right? Faulty wiring, started in the basement?
what are you, a firebug?
no. News junkie.
I remember there were a lot of children that were rescued.
you remember hearing that two teachers died?
Yeah, it must have been pretty horrific, huh?
just another day on the job.
I also hear that you were injured.
why do I get the feeling that you just put on your psychiatrist hat?
Hey, you're the one in the dangerous profession.
Yeah, well, keep your medal.
it was after the fire was out, I was on my way back to the truck, I...
stepped on a hose nozzle and landed funny, broke my foot.
sounds painful.
not as bad as getting back to the firehouse and having all the guys hopping around on one foot, doing the "Gemma."
did you report it to anyone?
FDNY has 11, 000 firefighters.
only 32 of them are women. You think I report a grievance every time someone makes a crack?
how's the spinal fluid look?
clear.
all right, so the problem's probably not bacterial.
eh, she's a little off, though.
I mean, she didn't even blink when I showed her the spinal needle.
she kept rubbing her index and little finger together on her right hand.
you know, she said she's been feeling nauseous since having the stomach flu.
and she spaced out pretty hard with me.
maybe a brain parasite is causing her psych symptoms.
well, maybe not a worm, just psych.
you thinking PTSD?
look, she's been laid up for months, she heals her broken foot
just before she goes back to work she gets sick to her stomach?
classic physiological response to the threat of reentering a traumatic setting.
sounds like a job for a shrink.
let me guess-- the clinic?
duty calls.
good, get her home safe.
that was quick.
got a patient for me?
Yeah. Well, what happened with our hotheaded chauffeur?
I found a meningioma compressing his amygdala.
explains his rage.
so he'll be a different guy when you take it out, right?
he refused to let me operate.
well, that's unacceptable.
it's his choice. What am I supposed to do?
I don't know, charm him, bully him, reason with him, cajole, threaten, beg, bribe.
should I go on? - I tried.
wait, he'll die if you don't operate, right?
Yes, and he knows that.
look, if you want to try to convince him, go for it.
Oh, right, yes, you don't have time to waste on people who are throwing their lives away;
you help people who want your help.
I have people here who want my help.
in the time it takes me to chase this guy down, I could be treating patients.
okay, in a couple of months from now, when you hear that Ben died from something you could have treated, - how you gonna feel? - Fine.
Really? A man you could save with one arm tied behind your back, if only he were smart enough to let you.
okay, so go find him.
do it for all the vending machines in the world.
unidentified structure fire, 312 East Bronx Avenue.
that doesn't sound like the Top 40.
it's my favorite thing.
there's always something going on out there.
may I?
Hey, why don't you have a seat?
I hate chairs.
you know what? Me, too.
are you here to shrink me some more?
let's talk about your family.
married, kids?
single. Are you really gonna...?
okay, I'll sit if you sit.
so Dr. Holt told me that your father was a firefighter.
they were firemen back then.
you know, let's talk some more about the East 27th Street fire.
Why?
you've seen some pretty terrible scenes.
maybe sometimes you feel as though you're reliving them.
if you're asking if I get flashbacks, I don't.
the only memories I have are of the people when you pull 'em out, how their fear turns to joy, and the kids in that fire-- they were no different.
so your job never makes you feel hopeless?
it's like I told the department shrink:
if you' waiting around for me to cry, u're gonna be disappointed.
I'll be right outside.
I didn't ask for a house call.
Oh, I'm sorry, is this your house?
I came by to get you to, uh, to stop acting like an idiot.
I already told you, no surgery.
Oh, then I must be the idiot, 'cause I can't understand why a guy would rather die than have an operation that could save his life.
because I deserve it.
nobody deserves brain cancer.
they would for what I did.
Ben, I've pulled tumors out of people whose lives weren't worth a damn and people who were living saints.
cancer doesn't discriminate.
look, I made up my mind. Are you done?
can you just stop acting like a stubborn jackass long enough to think about your family?
they'd be better off, if I just wasn't around.
Oh, so your wife gets to watch you commit slow-motion suicide, your son gets to beg you to live, hoping that you won't fly into a rage, give him a few more bruises.
well, that's going to be a fun way to deal with you for the rest of their lives.
th-this thing inside my head...
it's really what's making me so angry?
hard to believe, but yeah.
and you're sure you can get it out?
no doubt at all.
okay. Okay, I-I want you to do it.
I want the surgery, but...
in case I die and word somehow gets out about all the things I did...
what else did you do?
I want my son to know that, that what happened back in September -
it, it was just an accident, and I want you to tell him that, okay?
what are you talking about?
it was two months ago.
I was in a rage.
I was driving home from work.
I was yelling at my... my boss on the phone.
I was so... so angry.
at him, at the whole world, and at this woman, this stupid woman who ran out into the street before I hit her and I didn't even stop.
where was this?
alphabet City.
what did she look like?
she was white, um, she had red hair.
she had this, this clip-on badge from her job, I guess.
Tucker, let's go; your wife bailed you out.
you'll still do the surgery, right, Doctor?
Dr. Holt.
Dr. Holt, please. - Let's go.
Dr. Holt, please help me.
you're not on the schedule today.
Yeah, uh... What's the worst patient you've had?
you mean like a pain in the ass?
you want it alphabetical or by degree of annoying-ness?
no, I just-- I mean, uh, somebody who did something unforgivable.
rapist or murderer or child abuser?
did you ever refuse to treat somebody?
like, the thought of making them better just made you feel sick to your stomach?
last I checked, the Hippocratic Oath does not contain the phrase "Thou shalt not treat the skeevy."
maybe it should.
patient in Exam Room Two is ready for you.
Yeah.
looks like something's on your mind.
a patient, uh... I can't talk about him.
you're invoking privilege?
with a dead person?
who am I gonna tell-- the birds?
you ever wonder what would have happened if you'd just let the ball go, get it after the car passed?
no.
you really never wonder what if?
do you remember that terrible coffee place near UCSF?
the Ground Level.
the coffee tasted almost as bad as the name.
exactly, and I tasted it once and vowed that I'd never go there again, and then during boards, my coffeemaker broke, and I had to go back.
and I ran into you and spilled espresso down the front of your shirt.
and that's why what if's don't work.
cause what if my coffeemaker hadn't broken?
Michael, I'm confused. Are you seeing patients or not?
cause I got a waiting room full of 'em if you are.
I just came by to talk.
okay.
Oh, excuse me. You're late, and bottoms up.
what's happening?
uh, phone's been ringing off the hook.
not the clinic. - No, no, your jailbird Ben Tucker.
five calls from him, three from his wife.
want me to get 'em on the line?
not yet.
Oh, gee, I wonder who that is.
Hey, you figure out Gemma's PTSD?
Yeah, only that it's not PTSD.
she's not exhibiting classic symptoms.
okay, so let's take another run at her.
well, we can't. About an hour ago, she heard about a two-alarm on that scanner of hers.
against medical advice, she bolted.
Michael, it's Chief Hawthorne. He says it's urgent.
Gemma, what happened?
thought I could help.
you were supposed to stay at Holt Neuro.
she showed up ten minutes after we made it here.
grabbed her gear, started to follow us inside.
you're still clean, so I'm guessing you never made it in.
I tried, I really tried, but... my mind kept freezing up, you know, and I was useless, just like at 27th Street.
you weren't useless then, Gemma, you saved those kids.
but you didn't save the teachers, did you, Gemma?
but that wasn't her fault.
Yeah. Yeah, it was. I could have saved them.
I had just found the kids, I heard a banging on the door.
I tried to open it, but... I had to get the kids out.
you heard the teachers?
I thought I had time to get back in there, and I... I had to make the call. I...
and then the room collapsed.
I could just hear their screaming.
none of this is in your after-action report.
I'm sorry, Chief, I...
save it. We need to get you back to Holt Neuro.
come on, Gemma, come on. Let's go.
I-I couldn't put it in the report b-becau...
Gemma. Gemma! Oh, God.
bring a med bag over here and an intubation kit and bring a board.
my God, what's happening to her?
she's having a seizure. Just stay back.
we're her doctors; we got it.
Where's your board?
got the lorazepam. Phenytoin?
take that. - Got it.
swab.
all right, here we go.
got it.
okay. Let's roll her.
there we go, there we go.
she's having shallow respirations. We got to intubate her.
position her jaw.
bag her. - Okay.
Oh, hold on... there she goes again.
I'll give her a second dose.
there you go.
all right, let's take her to Holt Neuro.
on my count, guys.
one, two, three. Up.
she's in status epilepticus.
still seizing.
a few more minutes of this, she's gonna fry her brain.
well, the propofol stopped her physical seizing, but the brain's still going.
the only time I've seen this was with drug interaction, but the only thing she's taking is antinausea meds.
unless she's lying.
get her purse.
Oh, here we go.
St. John's Wort
taking this as an antidepressant and she didn't tell us.
all right, give me 20cc's of cyproheptadine now.
serotonin Syndrome?
the St. John's Wort interacted with the antinausea drug, spiked her serotonin levels, causing the blank episodes and now the seizures.
all right, come on. - All right.
okay, it's working, it's working.
and brain seizure stopped.
so... is your firefighter going to make it?
just barely.
I heard someone else might not be so lucky-- Ben Tucker.
Where'd you hear that?
his son Steven called, crying, wanted to know why you hadn't returned his father's calls.
what is bothering you about this case, Michael?
I mean, you said the guy's a jerk, but it's not like he killed someone.
okay, now I got to sit.
I just don't get it, Rita.
why someone deserves to live.
and... the other person? - They didn't.
well, if I know two things...
...It's that decisions like these are...
...well, above my pay grade.
what's the other thing?
you'll make the right decision.
what the hell kind of doctor are you?
first you, um, you tell me I'm gonna die and that you want to save me, and then when I agree, you just, you just vanish into thin air.
I'll do the surgery.
you will?
but there is something that you need to know before you put your life in my hands.
that woman that you hit.
what about her?
she used to be my wife.
I want the surgery.
why didn't you tell me?
I want to live.
Anna. - Doc, where are you going?
just get to Holt Neuro as fast as you can. I will meet you there.
starting his third liter now.
where are we on vitals?
bp and heart rate are stable.
Oh, no. Just hit a snag.
tumor's exposed, but it's encasing the middle cerebral artery.
Yeah, you peel that wrong, he'll bleed out or develop a clot.
I'm aware.
you gonna pay me when you wear out my floor?
sorry.
Where's your mom?
she went to get coffee.
you want to sit?
so... tell me what your dad was like before he started getting angry.
he was great.
when I was little, and he'd just started driving for the car service, he'd take me with him, let me ride shotgun.
he'd even turn customers down if they didn't like me coming along.
I saw the whole city from that passenger seat.
met people from more countries than I can count.
and got to spend time with Dad.
why did it take Dr. Holt so long to say that he would operate on my dad?
is he afraid that he won't be able to fix him?
all I can tell you is, when Dr. Holt says he'll make things right, he always keeps his promise.
I got it.
how are you feeling?
lousy.
what happened to me?
these did.
you should have told us you were taking something for depression.
I couldn't go to the department doc to get anti-depressants.
I'm already the only woman in the place. I got to be on happy pills to do my job?
Gemma, look, taking anti-depressants doesn't make you weak.
and neither does being depressed.
you sure about that?
my brother killed himself three years ago.
he was depressed.
wouldn't admit it.
refused to take medication.
the only weak thing he did was give up.
I'm sorry.
Gemma, look at me.
you're lucky to be alive.
you get some therapy and proper medication, you'll see the world in a different way.
I'll be seeing it from a desk.
I'm on administrative assignment for the foreseeable future.
that's forever.
you worked hard to get where you are.
you'll figure out something.
like what?
I just lost the one thing that I love.
better your job than your life.
I guess I just never thought of those two things as being separate before.
can I talk to you?
let me have a minute with the doctor alone, all right?
you guys wait outside.
Thanks, buddy.
did you tell them about the accident?
no. As soon as I get out of here, I'm going to turn myself in.
um, it's the only way I can live with myself.
some secrets need to come out.
I just hope they can forgive me.
can you?
this isn't about me.
it's about her.
this is who she was.
this is who died that day.
wait. Wait. That isn't her.
this is not the woman I hit.
brother Mike, you look troubled.
Oh, I'm fine.
I have this patient who, uh, talked to me about wanting to contact a spirit.
figured I'd humor the guy, ask an expert.
as a shaman, how do you go about it?
well, you can tell him that he should, uh, build a shrine.
what kind of shrine?
a collection of objects that has meaning to the spirit.
or to whoever's trying to call it from beyond.
and that's it? - Yep.
you could light candles, too.
play a song that has meaning.
most importantly-- and if the guy were you, this would be the hardest part
just be patient.
Yeah, of course.
what am I doing here?
stupid.
of all the times I've appeared since I died, this is the first I'm not happy to be here and see you.
I'm sorry. I don't blame you.
why didn't you tell me?
didn't you think I'd want to know who killed me?
it wasn't supposed to be a secret; I just didn't know how to tell you.
I... I... I guess I wanted to spare you the pain and the rage that I felt when I found out.
but it doesn't matter now.
because you forgave him?
because Ben wasn't the one who killed you.
did you know that before you operated?
I just found out.
so you saved him anyway.
it took me a while to get there.
so who did he kill?
I don't know.
eye on the ball, Michael. All the way to the racquet.
good, good.
racquet up. Racquet up.
three.
five.
seven.
uppercuts. Come on, uppercuts.
jab. Jab, jab, jab, jab, jab! Focus, Michael.
okay, Michael, just let your mind go blank.
climb as fast as you can.
great, Michael. - I'll take it.
so how'd I do, Ed?
did you really come to me just because you placed third in the Miami Triathlon?
I placed second last year.
dropped two brackets in my pro-am tennis tournament.
so what's the deal? Why am I slipping?
well, it's definitely not your form.
our first session showed that it's kinetically excellent.
second session showed that your muscle function, glucose conversion and your O2 consumption are at their peak.
okay, so what's my problem?
you're scared.
excuse me?
today, I'm seeing a split-second of hesitation at the moment of commitment.
some type of emotional block.
is that why the other docs call you E-Mo?
go straight for the touchy-feely?
well, I'm double-boarded.
psychiatry and neurology.
well, I don't do couches.
well, fear is what's stopping you, Michael.
I stick my hands inside people's skulls all day and never blink.
well, in your personal life.
I'm okay there, too.
maybe it's something you haven't faced yet, a part of your past coming back to haunt you.
you're a real pain in the ass, aren't you?
I can be.
so how'd you like to consult for Holt Neuro?
took you long enough to ask.
well, I'm looking for a new neuroshrink.
you've worked for the Giants, Jets, three Olympic teams.
maybe it's time you step up your game.
I can come by later.
do that. We'll chat.
Hey, Michael.
you never did tell me what you were scared of.
I'm not your patient, E-Mo.
I'm so proud of you for seeing a psychiatrist.
you're starting to open up.
finally, a perk to being dead.
please talk to me.
Michael, don't ignore me.
can you really not see me anymore?
Michael, please. - Yes, I can see you.
Oh, thank God I'm not crazy.
wish I could say the same thing.
don't do that again. You are my only contact to the living.
do you mind? I have to shower.
please. We were married; I've seen you naked.
now, about that fear that your shrink was talking about...
he's a sports medicine doctor. And why are you eavesdropping?
you know I still can't control when I show up.
do you want to know what I think you're afraid of?
do I have a choice? - I think you're afraid of ghosts.
well, I'm not afraid of them. I don't believe in them.
I think you like your life when it's nice and neat and predictable, and the moment that something you can't control shows up, you get spooked.
you know, when you're done, can we talk about your faults? 'Cause I have a list, too.
don't believe me, ask your new shrink.
he is not my shrink and I'm not afraid!
who are you yelling at?
sorry. Just thinking out loud.
well, you're looking chipper. Did we top our personal best?
we offered the guy a job.
Oh, to, uh, work here?
you think the clinic could afford him?
ed Morris, New York's best neuropsychiatrist?
he goes by the name E-Mo.
speaking of doctors the Clinica can't afford, you're due there for a few hours today.
you also have a vertebroplasty, a translateral interbody fusion, and in your office right now is an emergency consult
Monica Lee, 17, a senior at Riddington Prep.
what's wrong with her?
her dad asked the same question.
apparently, Monica had some sort of spell at school yesterday.
okay.
surprise!
so this happened yesterday?
make a wish, beautiful.
Yeah, make a good one, like "I actually graduate."
Monica, you okay?
I think she's ignoring you. - No, something's wrong.
Monica? Say something!
someone go get the nurse.
well, that must've scared you.
Yeah, freaked my friends out, too.
not enough to keep one of them from putting it on the Internet.
dad, it's no big deal.
tell me what happened, Monica.
I don't really know.
I felt fine all morning, and then at school, my friends surprised me, and all of a sudden I couldn't move.
any headache? - No pain at all.
I just went blank and then passed out for a minute.
dad's acting like I'm gonna die or something.
PJ said you were out for three minutes and no one could wake you up.
I'm fine now.
well, it appears what you had was a mild seizure.
Oh, my god. - But I wasn't shaking.
it's called an absence seizure.
the brain momentarily freezes and the ability to speak gets interrupted -
often triggered by a bright or pulsating light.
like the sparklers?
that's right. Video games can do it, too. Sometimes just watching TV.
every time I turn around, she's watching TV, on her computer, texting with her friends.
can you help her?
well, first I want to confirm the diagnosis by doing an electroencephalogram.
will that hurt?
only because you can't text during it.
come on, let's get you to Diagnostic.
my arm feels weird. It's tingly.
okay, right or left?
Monica, talk to me.
what's going on? - Monica, can you hear me?
are you in pain?
what the hell is happening here?! - Time to find out.
how you feeling, Monica?
not so good. Was it another absence seizure?
well, this time you had the arm numbness and the head pain, but no bright light to trigger it.
so I'm thinking it's what's called a transient ischemic attack.
what's that? - It's a ministroke.
it's when the oxygen to the brain is cut off briefly without any lasting effect.
but clearly they're getting worse.
well, TIA can be a warning sign for a more serious stroke.
but I'm too young to have a stroke.
well, that's why I'm keeping you here now.
there are a number of things that can cause TIAs, like using cocaine or methamphetamines.
both can constrict the arteries in your brain.
I don't do drugs.
good.
any family history of clotting disorders or early strokes?
Monica's mother died of lupus a year and a half ago.
well, autoimmune diseases can also be a trigger for clots.
we'll run a rheumatology panel and see if lupus is the culprit.
and, um, what if it is?
dad, you always think the worst.
I'm just worried about you.
if it's lupus, we'll treat it with medication. Just try to relax.
both of you.
answer it. - Too early for visitors?
seems a gaggle of Ms. Lee's friends have invaded our lobby with balloons and ice cream.
did you text them to come here?
maybe.
all right, Monica can have visitors, but only for a minute.
then have a nurse take her for an MRI and run a sed rate and an ANA.
will do. - I'm serious. One minute.
thank you, Dr. Holt.
Dr. Holt?
about Monica's drug use... - She's done drugs before.
I saw the way you looked at her.
well, it was last year, after her mother died.
I noticed she was staying up all night, talking real fast.
so I did one of those home drug tests on hair from her pillow.
found cocaine.
did you confront her? - And she admitted it.
said the past year of losing her mom was just so hard.
and she promised she'd never do it again.
I'll test her blood. - Dr. Holt, Monica is a brilliant cellist.
she wanted to go to Vassar on a music scholarship, just like her mom, then a few months ago, she just stopped playing. Bombed on her SATs.
and then last month, she broke up with her boyfriend.
him.
Hey, Mr. Lee. - Hello, PJ.
I-I know Monica thinks I'm way too controlling.
I don't know what's gotten into her.
I'll let you know the results of her tox screen.
PJ, can you leave?
I just want to make sure you're okay, Monica.
we're all really worried about you.
okay, I'm fine, really.
Monica, it's okay. Let PJ stay.
dad, I told him not to come and he came anyway. Just get him out of here.
I just want to see you.
can you tell him to leave? - You don't want to stay and referee?
I believe the Clinica needs me.
Dr. Zeke. Missed you last week.
Hey, Anton.
you were on tour, right?
Kate said you're, um, you're in a band.
Yeah. The Credible Hulk Man.
you've probably illegally downloaded all our stuff.
hard to quit when you're on tour, huh?
crowded vans, loud bars.
who says I want to quit?
a spirit flies freer when we make free choices.
my spirit's afraid of heights.
Zeke, there are ways to stop your addiction.
herbal tinctures, meditation.
sometimes even substituting a stalk of celery can work.
but how do you light it?
good work. First step's the hardest.
I got a patient.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm Dr. Zeke. Looks like your boy's not feeling too well.
well, let's get him inside.
after I got out of bed.
he couldn't even eat breakfast.
so it was just dry heaving?
no, I'm pretty sure I saw some Halloween candy, too.
even though I told him to throw the rest of his out the other day.
I did. I swear!
then why am I here instead of work? Huh?
deep breath. And out.
give me one more.
buddy, did you eat too much candy last night?
maybe you also stayed up too late watching that monster movie marathon on channel two.
your shirt gives you away.
okay. I stayed up last night eating candy.
David!
you do get props for being a werewolf man, though.
Yeah, 'cause vampires are stupid.
a few hours of IV fluids for the dehydration and he should be ready to rock and roll.
I got to to go to the bathroom.
you have to throw up?
no, the other way.
come on, I'll show you where it is.
Dr. Holt, another day, another dollar.
only if you mean I'm losing one.
Hey. - Hi.
getting ambitious there, Little Creek?
I thought the car only wrecked into the lobby.
well, Clinica's expanding, Brother Mike.
since when?
unrestricted grant. Can spend it however we want.
with all those ER's closing, got to be ready for sicker patients.
she already rented the storefront next door, put down payments on an ultrasound and X-ray machine.
told me to start building a trauma room, and critical care bays.
Dr. Kate express is rolling, fellas.
get on board or get your ass run over.
you did not just say that. Did she just say that?
Zeke, how's your patient?
Barfy, but recovering.
where is he?
locked in the bathroom. I went to see how he was and he didn't answer.
baby, are you sick?
open it.
find the key, Zeke. - I'm trying.
David?!
you know what, Anton can fix the door.
weak pulse.
Why?
well, buddy, you gave us a pretty good scare in there.
are you okay?
my stomach hurts.
you remember falling down in the bathroom?
there are no bumps or bruises or cuts.
he didn't hit his head. How did he present?
dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting.
look at this.
you know, I did see some blood in the toilet.
me, too. Then everything went dark.
I'm sorry for yelling at you earlier.
he was up all last night eating leftover Halloween candy.
maybe something was tampered with.
he needs an X-ray of his stomach to make sure he didn't swallow anything that damaged his insides.
and that, my friend, means you get to take a ride in an ambulance to the hospital with lights and sirens and the whole shebang.
if I swallowed something bad, is that why there was blood in the toilet before?
before when? Earlier this week?
a month ago when I was sick.
did you know this?
no. I thought he had the flu.
I kept him from school for a couple of days.
honey, why didn't you tell me about the blood then?
I was embarrassed.
so probably it wasn't the flu or candy. More like food poisoning
undercooked meat, unsanitary food preparation.
no, no, no, my kitchen is clean.
do you ever go out to eat or give him fast food?
well, sometimes when my mom works late,
I'll buy a taco or some fruit from the stand on the corner.
we have a winner.
okay, start an antibiotic for the diarrhea.
I'll run a stool sample for salmonella, shigella, cryptosporidium, the usual suspects.
here, knock yourself out.
that's all you. I'm going to take it to the lab.
E-Mo, welcome to Holt Neuro.
I see you've met my lovely assistant.
Yes, and, uh, got some juicy stories.
a gift for our lab.
always so thoughtful.
and one for you. - Thank you.
Monica Lee's labs and images. We'll continue this later.
what do you got?
17-year-old Asian-American female with TIAs.
you start her on aspirin?
Yeah, 325 milligrams. Question is, why's she clotting?
tox screen is clean for cocaine and her labs are negative for lupus even though her mom died from it.
she's all yours, Patient Room A.
I'm pinch-hitting already?
well, something's going on that's making it difficult to get to the neuro problem.
she's wound too tight. Dad's a control freak.
so you want me to get in, root through the neuroses, find the answer and you take all the credit.
think of it as a tryout.
I don't have lupus?
the rheumatology panel that Dr. Holt ran came back negative.
as did all other tests. Can you feel this?
Yeah. - Thank God.
Monica, put that down.
I can't tell people the good news?
after we talk to the doctor.
Dr. Morris, if she doesn't have lupus, then what's causing her TIAs?
there could be other factors putting your daughter at risk.
smoking for one.
Monica doesn't smoke. Right, honey?
what did I say? - Don't take my phone.
you're lucky I don't throw it out the window.
now, the doctor wants to know if you smoke.
no.
well, there could be other behaviors causing this.
some of them are personal. Would you like your father to leave the room now?
why would I leave? She's a minor.
sexual matters are considered private, even for minors.
he can stay.
so, I've got to ask, are you sexually active?
I don't even have a boyfriend.
you did until you broke up with PJ.
that's why I broke up with him. Because he wanted to.
he did? - Dad, get real.
so you're not sexually active with anyone else?
no.
her mother and I raised her to wait.
how was your first patient?
she's a pretty good liar.
you're going to want to test her blood levels for estrogen and progesterone.
birth control hormones?
Yeah. The pills might put her at risk for blood clots a TIA and even a full-blown stroke, especially if she's smoking.
how'd you figure it out?
did you see her getting texts every five seconds?
diagnosis: 17-year-old girl.
but did you see her send a text?
I don't remember. - Well, I did.
her face was flushed, pupils dilated.
she's involved with someone.
even though she says she doesn't have a boyfriend.
results for that gift you gave me.
E-Mo, Rita will show you how to order more bloodwork on Monica.
I've got to go call my other job.
what other job? - Don't ask.
I swear, I'm trying to quit.
not before I borrow your lighter.
excuse me.
Dr. Mike.
it's E coli 0157.
that's not good. I better double-cover him with another antibiotic in case it's spreading to his blood.
you stock ceftriaxone?
that one we do have. Thank you.
it's just a little bump on the road to recovery.
please, make him well.
he's all I have in this world, okay?
he'll be fine. We're just gonna give him a little bit more medicine to make sure, okay?
hold it, Renata! - What the hell are you doing?
immigration. Back up. Renata's coming with me.
her name is Corina.
her name is Renata Ruiz, from El Salvador.
ice hit the factory she works in this morning.
No! - And she's so important you had to track her down?
illegals stop coming when you make an example of 'em.
no, he's not with me.
you told your boss you're going to be late
no, I'm sick. I'm sick. I didn't want Mr. Reyes to know.
she telling the truth, Doc?
Yes, she came here alone. For a bronchial infection.
and we really need to get her back inside.
that's right, sir, you can't take this woman, she needs treatment.
jailhouse Doc will see her before we put her on a plane.
let's go.
what the hell do we do?
mom's been deported, kid's left behind.
and E coli making him sick.
then he needs to be in a hospital.
can't take him to County, not with ICE hot on his heels.
you brought him here?
I know, he's uninsured. I'm just thinking, you know, he passed out earlier, maybe he does need a neuro workup.
Zeke, I'm not some golden ticket you can cash in whenever you want.
I tried taking him to County. They were full up.
I was gonna load him with antibiotics, send him home with his mom, but she's working tonight.
look, if I'm lyin' I'm dyin', this kid needs to be here.
as long as you send him to County the moment a bed opens up.
you know, dude, if you weren't an uptight surgeon, we could be friends.
Dr. Zeke?
Hi, buddy, what's wrong?
can't breathe.
I'm hearing diffuse crackles.
fluid in his lungs?
that's flash pulmonary edema. It'll drown him if we don't treat him.
come on, follow me.
SUX is in.
Why's a kid with food poisoning suddenly got lungs full of fluid?
let's solve it after we get him breathing again.
central line in? - And flushes easily.
nitroglycerin drip at 0. 1 micrograms per kilogram per minute.
somebody re-page the respiratory therapist.
says he'll be here in five.
can't wait. I'll have to intubate him.
here I go. Laryngoscope.
epiglottis is in view, but I can't see the cords.
Where's my anesthesiologist?
Dr. Lantz went off duty an hour ago-- already paged him.
Houston, we have a problem.
Yeah, I haven't intubated anyone since residency.
no, I mean this kid's got bruising all over his belly.
D.I.C? Could be getting septic from the E coli.
let's have dopamine standing by.
Zeke, gimme some cricoid pressure.
pulse ox down to 78%.
still can't see the cords.
he's suffocating. We got to bag him. - Yep.
lot of resistance.
and his sats aren't coming up. - I need the GlideScope.
GlideScope? Never used one of those.
and you wonder why I complain when I'm at the Clinica.
GlideScope. - Come on.
there's his cords.
Intertracheal tube.
down the hatch.
I'm in.
inflate the balloon.
O2 sats coming up.
98 percent. Kid's out of the woods.
now aren't you glad you let him stay?
I will be, when we figure out what made him crash.
platelets are low, and CBC shows elevated shistocytes, which damaged his kidneys.
explains the bruising, and why his lungs filled up with fluid.
it was all caused by the E coli.
hemolytic uremic syndrome.
he'll need to go on dialysis.
we can do that here. - Well, it's not going to be enough.
I'll get Doppler ultrasounds, check his urine electrolytes, and resend the CMP, but I guarantee you, that kid's going to need a kidney transplant.
damn it.
well, at least there's a good chance his mom's a match.
or...? - We'll put him on the list.
right? - Right.
thanks for your help, Michael. - Yeah.
talk to you tomorrow.
E-Mo. So did you prove your theory with Monica's bloodwork?
exactly what I thought it was.
you think I'm on the pill?
we know you are.
just like you knew before, and didn't say anything.
whatever test you did is wrong.
suppressed levels of endogenous estrogen is a reliable marker of someone taking oral contraceptives.
but I'm not.
okay, fine. You can lie to us all day long.
but you see this girl right here?
she's going to die if you keep lying to her.
listen to me.
you're a beautiful girl. You deserve to live a long and happy life.
but you're the only one that can make that happen, by telling us the truth about being on birth control pills.
Yes, I've been taking them.
Yeah, well, not anymore.
you lie about these, too?
smoking cigarettes and taking birth control pills is what landed you in here with blood clots.
you're on birth control pills?
PJ, what are you doing here?
Rita. Get him out of here.
you slept with someone?
you always said you loved me! - Get out!
Monica, please! - Everybody get out!
young man, you need to leave. - Let me talk to her!
okay. You got to leave. Go. Go.
let me talk to her, just for a minute! Please! I love her!
okay, okay, that's fine. Listen to me. Listen to me.
now's not the time, okay? You need to go home.
crazy thing is, he'll be in love with some other girl by the end of the semester.
we'd better contact the doctor who gave her those, so this doesn't happen again.
"Clinica Sanad..." What is that?
clinica Sanando. It's a free clinic not too far from here.
you know it? - It's my other job.
so your patient got the pills here.
Yeah. Which one of your Docs prescribed them?
doctor... Anna did.
girl must've lied to her about smoking.
or Monica was never here. This prescription is for Marisa Hernandez.
looks like your patient was popping someone else's pills.
Yeah. Nice. Time to lower the boom.
excuse me. E-Mo. It's Michael.
Yeah, you need to have another little conversation with Monica Lee.
well, turns out it wasn't even her prescription. Somebody named Marisa Hernandez...
did you tell him?
no. I didn't get the chance.
we gotta tell him. - I know.
so what's the plan with the kidney kid? His mom a match to donate?
Michael, this is... my fault.
I asked Zeke to withhold something from you.
no, you didn't, it was my idea.
somebody care to clue me in?
and his mom was grabbed by Immigration.
and you knew this last night?
that's why he couldn't go to County.
Oh, so your solution was to lie to my face.
dude, I didn't know he was going to crash and need a kidney transplant.
have I not gone out of my way to help this place?
ignored my own patients?
I hired you, Kate, remember that!
I... I know. I know, and I'm sorry. And it really... it really was all my idea.
no, it wasn't. I came up with the lying part.
Oh, so it took both of you to hatch this brilliant plan.
what's next? You gonna... you gonna knock over my pharmacy?
come on. You think he'd really get a new kidney if ICE kicks this kid back to El Salvador?
Oh, God. Not me. No, I'm done. I am done with this place.
you'd really toss him out of there?
I trusted you, Zeke! I trusted both of you.
I know.
look, Michael, I really, I am so... I'm sorry.
I... if the mom's a match, I'll pay for the transplant.
what? - Kate, come on.
even if he was a citizen, a transplant's $100,000.
my grant is unrestricted. I can use it however I want.
and not have a dime left over?
what about your other patients here, what about the new trauma room?
I'll find a way to pay for that.
somehow, some way. But like I said, right?
get on board, or get your ass run over.
God, that again. How long is she gonna keep saying that?
till we get it through our thick skulls, I guess.
Yeah, mine's too thick.
I could do five years and lose my license for harboring that kid.
I want him out of Holt Neuro within the hour.
what's wrong?
those two are liars.
is that how you train your people to practice family medicine?
is that how you practiced it?
you hired Kate.
Yeah, after your boyfriend recommended her.
Yes, I am completely crazy.
come. Talk to me.
what happened?
got tricked into hiding an illegal boy who needs a kidney transplant,
Zeke and Kate have put my whole practice at risk.
Yeah. That's just one of the many reasons I have to be mad.
no one should have lied to you.
that's right. They shouldn't have.
I'll remember that when the Feds are carting me off.
Oh, you're not scared of that.
you didn't know he was illegal, so your practice isn't at risk.
but you are afraid of something, Michael.
here we go.
and fear doesn't have to be the end of the world. Take it from me.
I was as scared of death as anyone, but hey, look at me now.
and whatever Kate and Zeke did, that boy is twice as scared as you are.
you don't think I know that? Really?
Oh, so you would have taken him in, if you'd known he was illegal and deathly sick?
Hey, Rita, what's up?
all right, just... stall him as long as you can.
what's going on?
exactly what I was afraid of.
you're not going anywhere till I'm done reading this.
so go back to Reception. We got magazines.
ma'am, you'll move, or I'll move you.
please, lay a finger on me. I haven't coldcocked anyone this week.
Rita? I got this.
your lucky day.
it's time to go. This is private property.
and here's my key to your kingdom. I'm taking the boy.
docs at the ICE infirmary said I can get him there safely.
just like they said Mom didn't have a bronchial infection.
which is why I went back to your clinic to talk to the security guard.
nice guy. Said he helped you put a kid in your car last night to bring here.
which is exactly where he's going to stay.
sir, you need to get out of my way. - And you need to listen to me.
he's a liar. I'm as happy about it as you are, but the truth is, that boy's going to die unless he gets a kidney transplant.
which is why you're not only going to leave, you're going to let us test the mom, because she's his best shot at being a donor.
what the hell are you people smoking?
it's simple. We get the boy, and mom.
you get them back when the surgery is done.
I'm reporting you.
do you have kids? - None of your business.
you've got a ring on your finger, you look like you know your way around a family dinner.
you know what I think? You gotta be a hard-ass at work, but when you get home, you're... you're a good dad.
am I wrong?
just let us have them long enough to do this.
when we're done, you can ship them off wherever you want.
mom?
I don't feel very good. - But you will.
Dr. Holt tested me and he says that I can help.
okay? - Okay.
this will work, right?
the transplant surgeon I have coming over is the best in the business.
both of you will be just fine.
headed home? - Wish I wasn't.
I called my dad to pick me up.
he must have talked to PJ, because he went to DefCon One before I even said hello.
have Marisa Hernandez talk to him.
who is she, Monica?
the sister of my new boyfriend. I stole her pills.
his name's Alex.
does he go to your prep school?
his parents can't afford it, but... he's an amazing artist.
that's how he got a scholarship to Riddington.
is that why you've kept him a secret from your father?
he'd freak out. My dad used to be so great.
and now all he does is talk about how I need to be with the right boy, like PJ.
and hang with the right friends, get into the right college.
and if he found out that Alex takes me to hip-hop clubs and not the Philharmonic...
he's just scared, Monica. - How do you know?
cause love can do that to you.
you know, it makes you the happiest you've ever been, and then suddenly it can give you something that...
I don't know, you're scared of losing.
Yeah. My dad's afraid of losing me.
Yeah. Just like he lost your mom.
what am I going to do?
I love my dad, but I'm also in love with Alex.
well, first of all, you and Alex need to see a doctor about getting some different type of contraception.
cause you can no longer take the pill.
I can't go to my family doctor.
he and my dad play golf.
can you refer me to someone? Please?
and because that wall adjoins to the clinic, eventually we'll remove it and put in a trauma room.
when I get another grant.
Hey!
Yeah, and recovering nicely.
anti-rejection meds seem to be working.
boy's gonna live, thanks to you.
you becoming a vegetarian?
nonsmoker.
Hi, Dr. Holt.
Hey, Monica. Didn't expect to see you here.
Hi, I'm Alex. - How you doing?
Dr. Morris said to come see you about birth control, that this is your other job.
look at that. Word's getting out.
you two can talk to, uh, Dr. Kate over here.
why don't you guys come inside.
why won't you love me?
somebody call an ambulance!
she's gonna bleed out before we get to the ER. Let's get her inside.
call the cops!
Monica, can you hear me?
pulse is weak and thready.
I'm betting the bullet hit her in the heart.
charisse, hang two bags of IV fluid and run them wide open.
is she gonna be okay?
what's the ETA on the ambulance? - Seven minutes.
you got to get back. - Please.
saline.
lost her pulse.
starting CPR.
Monica, stay with us.
penetrating trauma with witnessed loss of vital signs.
got to open her chest. - What, here?
we got no other choice. Somebody get me a thoracotomy tray!
it's at Holt with your Glidescope.
then get me a suture kit and a scalpel.
uh, and a vaginal speculum.
make it two. We can use them as rib spreaders.
works for me.
Zeke, take over compressions.
scalpel.
cutting the skin.
I'll cut the muscle.
come on, Monica, hang in there. You can do it.
start spreading.
I see the heart.
and the gunshot wound in the ventricle.
damn it. Got a suture?
Cross-clamping the aorta.
I'm not finding the aorta.
right here. Let me guide your hand.
there. - Feel it.
clamping the aorta. - Holding CPR.
I got a weak pulse.
cycling the pressure.
all right, hole's closed. No bleeding from the ventricle.
her heart's beating again.
this girl's gonna live.
systolic up to 95.
I got to admit, first time I ever cracked a chest.
this whole place has gone nutty ever since this guy started hanging around.
all right. Let's get her to an OR.
Monica came through surgery with flying colors.
never wanted to hear the sound of her getting a text so bad in my life.
thank you, Dr. Morris.
thank Dr. Holt; he's the one that saved her life.
Mr. Lee?
I'm Alex.
you're the one she's in love with.
I'd say you both are.
Hey. How's PJ?
arrested, in shock.
Yeah. Maybe I'll go see him later.
does that mean you're taking the job?
I don't know.
I send a girl to get a diaphragm, she comes back with a bullet in her heart.
I was actually hoping for something a little less boring.
welcome to Holt Neuro.
is that really necessary?
until I uncuff them back in El Salvador.
at least he's not going back in a coffin, right?
Yeah. And you won't be going to jail.
you know that report I was gonna file on you?
got lost in the system.
crazy day.
Yeah, they all seem a little crazy lately.
but I like that new E-Mo. - Oh, yeah.
he'll be a good addition.
so, what are my plans tonight?
two options.
michael Cunningham's book party or the shindig at the Met.
or you can join Len and me for ballroom dancing.
tempting.
good night, Rita.
night, Michael.
Hey.
Hey. Surprised to see you back here.
Yeah, just, uh... decompressing after that thoracotomy.
Yeah. I'm trying to scare up a new grant for this place.
although Anton is gonna keep building.
tell him to stop.
I tried. His response was,"Sometimes you have to "step into the void and have faith the ground will appear."
he wears socks with sandals.
I'm just saying. - Yeah.
Hey, you want to go grab a bite?
Yeah. No, I would love to, I just have a...
Hey. You ready to go? - Yeah.
Michael, meet Harrison. My husband.
Hi. Good to meet you, Michael.
great to meet you.
I don't wear a ring to work.
it actually, uh, it nearly fell down the drain while I was washing up.
honey, we have a reservation. - Yes.
we'll figure it out tomorrow. - Yep, we will.
okay, good night.
good night. Take care.
Dr. Holt. Didn't know you were still here.
care to take the last patient of the night?
sure. - Room two.
the authorities in Russia are bracing themselves today, for mass protests against the trial, of former billionaire Yuri Komarov.
the case against Mr. Komarov has caused widespread division amongst the Russian public, some of whom view his incarceration as a political maneuver, orchestrated by this man,
defense Minister Candidate Viktor Chagarin.
what do you want Viktor?
why are you doing this?
what do you want to accomplish tomorrow?
I'm prepared to pay for my sins.
you should prepare yourself too.
Yuri, let's be civil about this. We were friends once...are could be again.
just give me the file...
and I'll hand your life back to you.
forget this stupid trial.
I don't want my life back.
you think I'm going to let you talk tomorrow?
no one is going to hear you!
I own everybody in that courtroom.
you don't own me.
Mike.
Chagarin's making a move on Komarov.
shit. I'll see if we got local.
we are ready to get started.
make the call.
you won't disappoint me?
have I ever disappointed you?
Anton.
Alik, it's Viktor.
Yuri Komarov says hello...
it's time to grab him.
Yuri Komarov?
and goodbye.
McClane.
Hey, Murph, how you doing?
nice grouping, Grandpa.
Yeah, not bad.
is that it?
Yep. We found him.
it's not good, John.
hospital or morgue?
worse.
when was the last time you spoke to this kid?
it's been a while.
maybe a few years, even.
last time I saw him, it was pretty ugly.
well, there's a few different versions in there, but my people are pretty sure he's being held at a Moscow prison, awaiting sentencing.
what's he charged with?
it's a nasty sheet.
he'll be lucky to get life.
he can never get out of his own way.
he had a lot of problems.
he's still my kid.
I know.
but it's Russia. They do things differently over there.
me, too.
good luck, Poppy.
Thanks, kid.
God damn you! God damn it!
welcome to John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Thanks, kid.
McClane, good luck.
see you soon.
I was told you had something to offer me?
you're looking for evidence against Yuri Komarov?
perhaps.
put me in the courtroom with him...
and I'll testify that Komarov hired me to murder Anton.
did he?
I'll testify under oath.
that's good enough, isn't it?
Draganskiy courthouse?
you speak Russian?
how did I do?
well, you asked for a large bag of hair, on the way to Taganskaya courthouse.
but I got it. I got it.
good.
traffic sucks here, too, huh?
sex?
you want sex? Sexy clubs?
no. No sex.
it sucks, this traffic.
what is it? An accident?
no.
garden Ring. Is bad.
always traffic, always traffic.
you're American?
Yeah, American. New York.
the Big Apple.
I want to wake up in that city that never sleeps,
that's it.
Frank Sinatra. Chairman of the Board.
that's right.
the Chairman. Yeah.
you sing good.
these little town blues are melting away.
Yes, I sing.
I sing all the time.
Yeah.
king of the hill Top of the world.
huh?
heap. "Top of the heap."
all right, all right. Taganskaya courthouse, right there.
two blocks.
you better walk, traffic is bad. Really bad.
what do I owe you?
Hey, no money.
no money, you let me sing. You let me sing.
you listen to my singing. No money.
welcome to Moscow.
that little town blues are melting away.
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it, in old New York.

his rate of progress is way off.

mcc Reaper. MET now plus 6.
this is un-frigging-believable.
mcc Reaper. That's not how it works.
something's off. I know this guy. This doesn't happen.
mcc Reaper, 6-1 is in the hole. Stand by.
6-1, be advised, your window is closed.
time on target is no-go.
I say again, TOT is no-go.

damn you!
Oh, fuck!
Jack! I'm not done talking to you!
who is this?
come on, go!
concentrate, please.
that's right, come on through, yeah!

Jesus!
I'm tired of this guy.
RPG now!
Jesus!

Hey, hey!
Hey!
Whoa!
Hey! Whoa!
come on!
you gotta be fucking kidding me!
what?
do you think I understand a word you're saying?
Jesus Christ.
it's okay, I'm fine, thanks.
Oh, man, you're driving like my grandma!
when I say drive, I mean fly!
Oh, yeah!
get out of the way!
Oh, God.
Jesus!
Oh, for the love of...
sorry, ma'am!
sorry!
did you see this guy?
Oh, man!
knock knock.
guess who!
I've had enough of this shit.
Oh, man, hey!
is that it? Is that your best shot?
damn you, John.
damn you!
Hey! Up here!
shoot up here!
John! Get in!
get in before I change my mind. Jesus!
take your time.
Jack, what the fuck was that, huh?
shut up. Shut up, John.
I swear to God, I will put a bullet in you this time.
who do you think you're talking to?
the last person I want to see.
well, maybe you missed the whole part back there where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here from a whole bunch of Russian bad guys.
you saved? You saved?
that's right, saved.
shut up. - Shut up.
you're a world class screw-up, you know that, John?
I'm a screw-up? I'm a screw-up?
I'm still your father.
Yeah, nothing I can do about that.
what a joke.
just shut up. Try not to touch anything, all right?
you've done enough goddamn damage.
the appointment is next week...
we will begin immediately.
excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.
I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.
what happened?
some sort of attack on the courthouse.
who took him?
they don't know yet.
what do you mean you don't know?
eh...
well it's confusing...
eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov with an American.
what American?
John McClane.
let's go.
after you.
Yeah, I got him. Okay, I'm on it.
look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay. I'm sorry.
I understand.
this is the last guy on earth I expected to see.
listen to me, Yuri, you have half of Moscow looking for you.
I need you to get dressed. - Why am I here?
please put on these clothes. Trust me.
this is the key to your cuffs. Take these.
Oh, my Jesus.
are you okay? - What?
do you have the file on Chagarin?
this is what you been doing, Jack?
spy shit?
this is it?
you're a spy? Oh, my God.
the 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.
very nice.
McClane, shut up.
take it easy, oddjob.
I'm on vacation.
your mom will be pleased.
we thought you were doing drugs or something.
Mr. Komarov.
or selling drugs, but that was me, really.
do you have the file on Chagarin?
Yes, or no?
it's very simple, Yuri.
you give me the file, and I get you out of Russia.
and you're a free man. What do you say?
it's not about me. I don't care about my life.
well, that's the deal.
it's the only deal.
come on.
come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
what's it gonna be?
yes or no?
the clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.
you will get me out of here?
only the three of you?
whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.
I just got off the plane. I'm still jet-lagged.
I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?
only if I can take my daughter with me.
Chagarin's people will kill her.
fine. Make it quick.
Ah.
Where's the file?
it's in a vault in Prypiat, but the key is here in Moscow.
at Hotel Ukraina.
shit.
make your call. We're going to the Ukraina, let's go.
it's papa...
I'm fine, Sunshine...
we'll talk later.
listen.
I'll be waiting for you where your mother and I shared our first dance.
now.
Hurry! Hurry! You understand?
Mike, listen, I'm sorry about this morning, man.
it's fine.
okay, let's go.
contact!
down! Get down!
go! Get down! Go, go, go!
John, cover!
come on, buddy!
go! Go!
that's right, jerk-off!
all right, let's move, John!
I'm on fucking vacation!
come on, time to hustle. Watch your head.
McClane, move it.
8, 000 fucking miles for this?
get down, Yuri. Stay low!
head down.
come on. Go, go!
safe house, my ass.
he knows how old we are, no?
come on.
here, here, here.
sit down. You're all right.
let me look at you.
it's all right. You're fine.
what are you doing?
Jack.
calm down, Yuri, okay? You're gonna be just fine.
here, put this on, stay warm.
what was that, John? Five minutes? Five minutes?
you blew a three-year operation in five minutes!
you're welcome! What do you want me to do?
unbelievable.
I'm so fucking burned. I got no friends in this town anymore.
what about your people at Langley? Just give them a call.
give me your phone.
it's a two-year contract on that phone.
what are you carrying? Give me that.
all right. You got any cash on you?
some American money.
what are you talking about? We need to keep on moving.
we have to get this guy to a doctor. To medical attention, Jack.
the mission stands.
your mission is bleeding out over there.
the mission continues. We go to the hotel.
come on, let's move. Let's move.
this is nuts.
what, are you going to go out and kill somebody else now?
why all this trouble for just one guy?
he's a political prisoner.
not that you care, John, but it's a matter of national security, all right?
he's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin, and we need that to happen.
well, great, Jack.
let's drop him off at the Embassy, and we can go home.
are you kidding me? After what happened at the safe house?
look, it doesn't work like that, all right?
it's a huge diplomatic mess, and I'm a burnable asset.
so, I now need that file to un-fuck this mission.
any more questions?
Yeah, just one.
how come you never called and told me where you were?
like you'd give a shit.
shit.
well, we're not going in the front door.
all right, hold up, hold up.
okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right? We're almost done.
as soon as we get that key, we're gonna grab the file, get you and your daughter out of Russia, all right?
all right.
listen to me, you're doing good. All right?
I need you to hang here a second. Keep an eye on him, John.
Hey, hey.
what is it with all this "John" shit? Whatever happened to "Dad?"
good question.
in Russia, we have word for men like him.
Krutoi.
it means "tough" , "hard" .
in America, it means "juvenile delinquent."
is he your only child?
no. I got a daughter, too.
you?
I have only my Solnyschka.
when she was little, I was working all the time.
I believed work was all that mattered.
I screwed my kid's life up, too.
you work all the time around the clock most of the time, when you're a cop.
I just thought that working all the time was a good thing, you know?
I didn't help him at all.
it's never too late,
I hope.
okay, let's go.
all right, Yuri, which part of the building is the ballroom in?
main tower.
main tower. Which floor?
top floor.
what about security?
you remember any guards? Cameras? Anything like that?
I don't know.
well, I need you to remember.
I was in prison for five years, how should I know?
everything could have changed. - I know.
just think, all right? Picture it in your head.
the ballroom was closed in '89.
I think it's under construction now.
so that floor's unsecured.
I don't know! Listen! My daughter is in there.
I'm scared to death, let's go!
just calm down, Yuri.
I guess you have done that before.
smart.
I could have done it.
Irina?
Irina?
Irina?
Papa.
Irina. - Papa!
that's tender.
Really? I wouldn't know.
need a hug?
we're not really a hugging family.
that's right.
we just have to get one thing...
and then we're leaving Moscow for good.
OK?
OK.
who are they?
the young one works for CIA.
the old one is his father. Americans.
then thank God for them.
there's something no good about this.
just shut up, all right?
I'm telling you, Jack, this smells bad.
just stop, okay?
this might seem like a totally foreign concept, you know?
I know you love to just run in, making shit up.
but like any professional, I have a plan.
so let's just stick to it, okay?
just move your plan along.
all right, Yuri, come on. Let's grab the key, get out of here.
Yes.
just take a moment.
how you doing?
fine.
how did you get over here so quick?
well...
I took Garden Ring.
Oh, the Garden Ring. Supposed to always be bad, right?
Hey, John.
did you get stuck in traffic?
I have it! I have it.
welcome, Americans.
put your goddamn guns down, asshole!
Papa, what is going on?
give me your weapons.
come and get them.
Really?
really.
Papa.
Yuri.
do it.
I thought you were a problem child.
this a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?
what are you doing?
it's about money, papa...
millions of dollars.
you think life was easy for me while you were sitting in prison being a victim?
but.
I'm your father.
and I am your daughter.
we should kill the old man now.
we still need him.
but then you can kill.
thank you.
Hi.
I don't know if I'm saying this right.
Hi.
do you know what I hate about the Americans?
everything.
especially cowboys.
I could have been a dancer. I swear to God.
but nobody supported me.
you two have been such a pain in the ass!
come on, come on!
I prefer dancing, really.
but killing is much, much better than working in a grocery shop!
Jesus Christ!
nice one.
you guys. So arrogant.
it's not 1986, you know.
reagan is dead.
sorry. Oh, God.
what's funny there?
can't tell you.
it's not you. I love these outfits.
you guys are looking good.
that was enough, thank you.
let's dance.
come on! Come on!
Jack!
remember the last time we talked just before you went away?
Oh, no! Not at all!
you're not gonna open up to me right before we die!
no, that's not your thing, John.
what's my thing?
fucking killing bad guys, that's your thing!
you're not gonna die today!
go!
shit!
fuck.
we're finished, John.
I'm taking care of it now.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.
Jack. Hey!
Jesus!
come on!
let's get out of this building!
where are they?
come on.
Alik, that's it. We're done!
let's go!
break left!
copy, Commander.
do you have him?
Yes.
and the file?
does he have it?
I need that file, Alik.
he's taking us to it.
no more mistakes, Alik.
and when you have the file...
kill them both.
Yes, sir.
shit.
that was exciting.
Yeah. Loads of fun.
you wanna go again?
are you shot?
no.
no, I'm fine.
let me take a look at that.
it's fine.
Oh, fuck.
I can't believe she betrayed her father for Chagarin.
I don't understand that.
someday you will.
kids.
what's our next move?
I don't know.
you don't know? - I don't know, all right?
I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know.
I don't know.
I screwed up.
I blew the mission.
well, then we're done, right?
Yeah, we're done.
we're done.
we should just go home.
we'll stop by a little pharmacy on our way out of Moscow, get you some merthiolate or mercury and fix up your little scratches, here.
get you home. Get a little toy set.
get yourself a nice warm glass of milk with a little Bosco in it.
get your CIA slippers.
all right.
what? - I get it.
what the hell are we gonna do?
what's in the file?
evidence on Chagarin.
evidence about what?
Chernobyl.
look, listen to me.
Komarov and Chagarin used to have this nasty little side-racket going on back in the day.
they siphoned weapons-grade uranium, got greedy, caused the meltdown.
then, you know, they fell out.
former partners, bad break-up.
scumbags.
so, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.
you know, put him in a hole, forget about him.
doesn't have to worry anymore.
so what happened to rescuesque?
well, he grew a conscience.
Yeah, well, that figures.
listen, Chagarin is bad news. He's the real deal.
if we see this guy in control, we're gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
I'm talking terrorism,
WMDS, nukes.
someone has to stop him.
well, that's what we do.
we go out to Chiapep and we do our thing.
our thing?
Yeah.
we go out there and kill a lot of scumbags.
what? You got something better to do?
all right. Pull it.
you're not gonna cry, are you?
just pull it.
everybody needs a good cry once in a while, Jack.
don't be ashamed. - Pull it.
you remember that time when you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna have that house-painting job?
got your finger caught in the ladder, you cried for about five, six days.
John, just pull it!
all right.
on three. Here you go.
one, two...
good God.
Jesus.
when was the last time you had a tetanus shot?
you all right?
Yeah.
we need a car.
Atta boy.
back to work.
Hey, Watergate, how's that lock coming?
almost there.
here, try these.
come on.
Oh, stealing. That's nice. Real nice, John.
Yeah, I'm up for the Father of the Year award.
whoa.
all right.
how'd you know all of these guns were gonna be here?
it's a Chechen hangout.
owner doesn't like guns in the club, so these bozos leave them in their cars.
learn a lot in three years?
Yeah.
you sleeping?
I was.
jet-lag.
jeez, when was the last time we were in a car together?
drive home from Trenton.
I had to bail you out for that weapons charge.
yeah?
no, it was the fire thing, right?
when you set South Philly on fire, you mean?
we had to take out a second mortgage on the house to make your bail.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
it was funny.
are we really going to Chernobyl?
Yeah.
the Chernobyl.
the radioactive joint? Meltdown?
that's the one.
it's not the Chernobyl in Switzerland, right?
with all the skiing and the snow and everything?
you mean Grenoble?
no, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble.
Eddie Collins's kid took him on vacation last year.
they went down to Boca.
Oh, yeah?
spent four days at the track.
well, that's nice.
that's relaxing.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
we have to go to Chernobyl?
Yeah, sorry about that.
but all the radioactive stuff is out, right?
is it as you remember, papa?
I don't want to remember.
tough.
the file is in the inner vault.
very touching. Let's move.
which one is it?
get moving, old goat.
couple of fresh coats of paint and a weedwacker and it's good to go.
you know, at first, they denied anything even happened.
held a children's parade the next day to prove it.
24 hours later, 50, 000 residents were evacuated.
never came back.
as soon as they get in that vault, Komarov's a dead man.
all right.
you got a plan?
not really.
I kind of thought we'd just wing it.
you know, run in, guns blazing, making shit up as we go.
yeah? - Yeah.
what is this? A pirate gun?
Yeah. It's old school, man.
like you, right?
Yeah, like me.
one of these days, I'm gonna have a long talk with you.
look, Jack,
I'm sorry your partner got killed.
I'm sorry I fucked up your day. That wasn't my plan.
I caused you problems.
you know, I came here for something else.
and all that other bullshit. I mean,
I had a pretty good day.
it's fun, running around with you.
it's good to see you.
I love you, boy.
you, too.
I want you to know I got your back.
I got yours, too.
all right. Let's go kill some motherfuckers.
key.
okay, what the fuck is this?
I'm losing my patience. The fucking file better be here.
radiation has been pooling in this room for decades.
you've underestimated us, Daddy dearest.
bring it in!
Atta boy.
come on! Come on!
compound 27-4. It neutralizes radiation, trust me.
all clear. We can ditch the suits.
the hell is that?
one billion euros worth of enriched uranium.
what?
don't worry, it's stable in this form.
file!
Irina, cut the crap, please.
no one here is speaking about uranium. Where's the file?
no more games, where is the file?
that's no longer your concern.
sunshine...
you did well.
I told you...
everything would work out.
come to papa.
pap, You're a genius.
I know.
load it up.
Pegasus?
do you copy?
a lot of hardware for a file.
wheels up in five minutes.
perfect.
here you go, Sir.
team extraction completed. She's all yours.
good...
are you inside?
Yes, yes, Viktor.
I'm inside.
Yuri?
you surprised?
I'm in the same place where it all started before you betrayed me.
remember...
you promised to give me my life back.
you gave it back to me.
I thank you for that.
and now...
I'm going to take yours.
static 4, we are ready for take off.
static 4, do you copy?
Yuri!
Yuri.
Where's the dancer?
you okay? You hurt?
no.
I'm good.
I'm all right.
what's in these boxes?
thank God you're here, Jack.
we have to leave.
they're coming back any minute.
just let me get the file.
what's in the boxes?
it's U-235.
weapons-grade uranium.
armored cases.
the bomb kind?
Yeah, the bomb kind.
not so fast, Eddie.
are you crazy?
Yeah, a little bit.
I'm getting the file.
no. No, you're not.
the key. It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?
what? No. No, I...
you put this shit in here, right?
what? No.
right?
I didn't know, Jack.
is that the dancer down there?
what are you talking about?
that's a tough break for a good athlete.
Jack, you know me.
Yeah, I know you. I know you.
I know him better.
never was a file, was there, Yuri?
of course there was no file.
it was simply bait.
what I needed was in this vault.
Chagarin was the only one with enough power and influence to get me out of jail.
I used him.
I used you.
it's about money.
when's it not about money?
you want to arrest me?
you're out of your jurisdiction, Detective McClane, aren't you?
I wouldn't worry too much about being arrested.
see, my boy is in the CIA.
no phone call.
spy shit.
goddamn Americans. You think you're so smart.
no, I'm not that smart. I'm just on vacation.
my boy here.
he gonna put a whooping on you.
move!
you can say goodbye to your daughter, you dumbwit fuck.
Where's your little Soltschanitsa?
shit! God damn it!
shit!
Irina, I'm going to the roof...
the roof!
Jack!
set at 91.
power plant?
all good to go.
let's go!
subtle.
what the hell is in those goddamn grenades?
go get him!
I'm going to the helicopter!
Vadim, watch the tail.
copy. You are at 120 meters...
115 meters...
there is small arms fire coming from the roof.
we have a guest.
hatch the tail for me there.
come on!
come on, hurry!
Vadim, give me firing control now...
Engaging!
Jack!
shoot him!
with pleasure, papa.
I'm on fucking vacation!
Vadim! He is there! I see him!
the shit we do for our kids.
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.
what happened?
CG's shifted...
I've got full forward cyclic.
I can't hold it.
Jesus Christ!
well done,
Mr. Super-spy.
what a shame your father won't be alive to see you promoted.
neither will you.
Hey! Jack!
hang on, John!
John!
come on!
we're out of ammunition!
shit.
bastards.
what the hell are you doing?
this is for you, papa.
John!
John!
John!
John!
dad!
right here.
did you just call me Dad?
no.
I didn't think so.
you're hearing things.
you got swimmer's ear.
we're not gonna grow any third arms or anything, are we?
no.
you might lose your hair.
laugh it up, kid.
this is you, five years from now.
it's rainwater. You'll be fine.
besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.
now you're a McClane?
Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.
John McClane Junior.
well, that makes you a senior.
that's right.
try not to forget it.
I'm your father.
have some respect for your father.
let me ask you something.
do you go looking for trouble or does it always just seem to find you?
you know, after all these years,
I still ask myself the same question.
# I had a dream last night that I was piloting a plane #
# And all the passengers were drunk and insane #
# I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp #
# Shot up a horde of zombies but I come out on top #

# In my room #
# Through the light, your face I see #
# Baby, take a chance baby, won't you dance with me #
# Lost all that treasure in an overseas war #
# It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for #
# Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor #
# Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors #
# What's that funky noise? #
# Sitting in the dirt feeling kind of hurt #
# All I hear is doom and gloom #

# Go boom, boom, boom #
# Through the night #
# Your face I see #
# Baby, take a chance Baby, won't you dance with me #

what are you doing here?
georgianna went a half hour ago. You're gonna miss it.
put that on my tab. Your bill.
"tab" sounds like y'all might pay it someday.
time was never a friend to Bobby Long.
it wouId conspire against him...
aIIow him to beIieve in a generous nature, then rob him bIind every time.
we had lost Lorraine, aII of us, but Iong before she died.
you can't park here. You'll get another ticket.
l don't see no signs, Miss Daisy.
lt's all right. l can walk to the curb from here.
get me a beer.
you find a job?
you clean the fuck up?
that Bobby guy called again today.
again? - He called a couple of days ago, remember?
no, you didn't tell me. What did he want?
he wanted to tell you about Lorraine.
what about her?
she died.
she what?
she's dead, all right? He called because he thought you'd wanna know.
Lorraine died and you didn't tell me?
to Lorraine. May she finally find peace.
so, now what? Lorraine finally kick y'all out?
no.
she never would. Besides, God wouldn't let that happen.
Really? And why not?
cause God knows me, and l know God.
go.
Cecil's pretty torn up. Make sure he eats.
l'll see you later.
she never meant nothing to you...
and you didn't mean a damn thing to her. l didn't think you would care.
come on, baby, stop.
look, l'm sorry, all right?
why don't you just cook me some dinner and l'll go rent us a porno?
l have to go to a funeral, Lee...
unless l missed it because you forgot to tell me that my mother is dead! Fucking asshole. l am so out of here.
she was never your mother!
PursIane? This is Bobby Long again.
l don't know if you remember me...
but you missed your mama's funeral.
so long.
you got any smokes?
sorry, sir.
y'all going down to Cecil's? - ln a minute.
l'll see you guys. - See you there.
you got a light?
l thought you didn't have any. - l don't.
not for Junior.
he's got to cut down. He's got fierce emphysema.
that cough sends shivers of mortality down my spine.
he'd make a lovely corpse, but l'll make no contribution.
of course not. "Contribute only to one's own death." That's my motto.
did you get the girl? She know anything?
he'd make a lovely corpse." Come on, man. Charles Dickens.
are you serious? lt's Martin ChuzzIewit.
smart-ass.
new OrIeans is a siren of a city.
a pIace of fabIes and iIIusion.
a pIace Lorraine had to escape from...
and Bobby and I had to escape to.
away from AIabama...
away from Iives that no Ionger beIonged to us.
l thought she was getting better that last time, l really did.
when was that?
a few years ago, at least. - lt'll be six years, October.
was it that long since we seen her?
since you seen her.
we should have gone to the hospital with you.
you should have done a lot of things.
coming.
this Lorraine's house?
and who are you?
no one. l just live here.
come on in.
nice place.
Thanks. We try.
you're not old enough to be Bobby. - That's because l'm Lawson.
okay.
l'm sorry about your mother. You look a lot like her.
sorry to wake you so early. lt's barely noon.
Bobby. We got company, man. Wake up!
honey, put your bags down. We don't bite.
juice? - No.
Bobby, get up. She's here. - Who?
Pursey. - Who?
the girl is here. Get up.
so, when's the funeral?
lt was yesterday. lt was real nice.
you should have been there, young lady.
that's your opinion.
you must be here for some reason.
l guess you already know the deal on the house.
what deal?
the house. Your mother owned it. - The deal!
let me tell you what the deal is.
the deal is that Lorraine left the three of us the house.
Lawson and l are two-thirds, and you are only one-third.
she did what?
Lawson and l have been living here for some time.
your mother hasn't lived here for years.
and l don't believe that she thought you'd be interested.
Lorraine was great at being wrong.
purslane, honey, we are here to stay. This is our home.
lt's no big deal...
Lorraine thinking l'd share this shithole with two alcoholic strangers.
you are alcoholics, aren't you?
but we are not strangers. We were her friends.
we took care of her.
and this shithole is just fine for us.
lt's not suited for a girl like you.
l'm getting up out of bed now. You can watch if you want.
lt don't matter to me.
lt seems hard to believe...
that you haven't seen a man naked before.
not an old one.
l know that you're no innocent...
because l spoke to that boyfriend of yours...
you certainly didn't choose him for his brains.
you don't know nothing about me.
l guess that will change if we all became roommates, wouldn't it?
l'll see you later. l'm out of cigarettes.
my brand is on sale.
good to see you again, Purslane.
all growed up.
he's not usually such a jackass. He's just upset about Lorraine. We all are.
he's right, you know. l can't stay here.
lt's pretty funny, actually. My grandma was always talking about...
the pretty little house Lorraine was fixing up for me...
and l guess that was the Ernest & Julio talking.
lt's fine.
there's no real surprises here. - The hospital sent her stuff.
Lorraine would want you to have these.
they went everywhere she did.
she loved those books.
l guess l could unload them at a flea market or something.
here, l'll help you out. - No, l'm fine.
l really did want to come to the funeral. l just never got his message.
that girl looks so much like Lorraine.
l remember the first time you took me to see her sing.
lt was my first time in New Orleans.
l was so taken.
you were kind of sheltered.
choked by that silver spoon.
l thought she was so beautiful.
she was.
what else can l get you boys?
did anyone ever tell you that you smell like a Parisian woman in springtime?
every day, at least once. Y'all gonna eat?
the lawyer could get to her at any time.
so what? The will says we can stay for a year.
should l just come back?
do you know how lethal the smell of a Parisian woman in springtime is?
not nearly as lethal as a Louisiana woman who don't give a shit.
eggs and bacon, ma'am. Both of us. - Cheese on our grits, darling. Please.
you are fucking shameless.
why didn't you use the bed, sweetheart?
Oh, God. - I could have come in and cuddled with you.
that would have been fine with me.
we could have spooned together. - Save it.
why'd you give her this?
this is stories of misfits...
invisible people. lt's beautiful.
have you ever read it?
have you ever read any book?
Lorraine didn't know she was a poet.
l really do enjoy...
fostering inspiration.
Lawson's a writer. A fine one, too.
Really?
he's writing a book about me.
that's fascinating.
chapter 1: l got up, l got drunk, l passed out.
chapter 2: l got up, l got drunk. - Lovely and witty.
you're an embarrassment of riches, little girl.
which room is mine?
l'll need a place to stay, and y'all said l had a right.
just figured l'd stay here until you get fed up and leave.
we are never leaving. Never!
and don't even get it in your mind. - She should have Lorraine's room.
l'll stay out here. l'll bunk with you. - Okay, fine.
are you fucking crazy?
better than her poking around and finding out the truth.
she won't last. You're gonna make sure of that.
besides, you're always complaining how your bed is so cold.
you're too skinny for me.
so, y'all are really into books? - They're mostly Bobby's.
that's the plumage of an English professor. - Him?
a professor? - Yeah, he was a good one.
and you, you're really a writer?
Bobby likes to think l am.
these boxes are all Lorraine's, so...
so what?
l knew your mother pretty well. - How well?
she was hard to understand, but she kept the door to her heart open.
the way l heard it, it was more of a revolving door, wasn't it?
purslane Hominy Will.
how come you know my name?
l know a lot about you.
your mama and l were close since we were young.
l helped name you.
your mama thought you were golden...
so we named you after yellow flowers and corn.
this is you here:
pretty, golden purslane.
Purslane's really a weed, you know.
a neighbor told me when l was 9 and l ran over his tomato plants.
he said all gardeners hate purslane.
Yeah, and dandelions.
lt doesn't stop kids from making wishes on them.
Purslane's an axillary bloom.
lt closes up when the sun goes down.
Thanks.
damn.
last time l saw you, you were teeny.
ls there anyone here who doesn't remember me with Lorraine, or am l the only one?
she used to sing here. l was about your age. She was something.
l'm so sorry. - Don't be.
l'll have red beans and rice and a beer, please.
l hear you'll be staying at Bobby and Lawson's for a while?
no, l'll be staying at Lorraine's indefinitely.
will you be starting school in September? - No.
l don't go to school. l waitress. You need one?
no, just me and Uncle Earl.
they know you're not going to school?
they're all torn up about it. Ranks up there with being out of vodka and cigarettes.
y'all, this is Lorraine's daughter, Pursey. She's gonna stay with us for a while.
come on in.
you grew up real pretty. - Thank you.
make yourself at home, darling.
l'm Ruthie. My gentleman friend, Ray.
here 26 years.
go on and relax, baby. Drink your beer.
find anything?
l filled out a few applications.
you let that fresh young thing live with you?
she's fresh, all right.
l remember when there was a new one every night. Y'all was pussy magnets.
which one of y'all snores like a goddamn train?
Bobby. lf he's on his back, you have to turn him over.
l saw this program on the Medical Channel that you can cure people of snoring...
by cutting their throats open.
l believe that l do have a story for you gentlemen.
quiet. Bobby's gonna tell a story.
when l was growing up, l always hung around boys a couple years older than me.
and this one summer, l was, l don't know, 10 or 11 .
and we were doing all the normal things that boys in Alabama do.
we were fishing...
and playing ball, and swimming, and beating off.
but in addition to these activities of an innocent childhood...
mine included a lot of talk...
about this wonderfully elusive something called pussy.
l wasn't sure exactly what it was...
but l knew it was magical and very special because of the way it was spoken about.
always in a whisper.
l'd go through the fields saying it to myself: "Pussy."
one day, we was all...
playing ball out in a broom sage field.
and up rode Leroy Tuberville.
now, Leroy was an upstanding delinquent. Twelve.
and his shoulders were already broad, and his fingers were stained with tobacco.
and Leroy, he parked himself casually by third base, and he went in his pocket...
and he pulled out something. He started throwing it high in the air like that.
and l watched him play it cool...
his mysterious jewel going up and down.
l couldn't take it any longer. l had to ask.
what's that you got there, Leroy?
and everyone fell silent.
and Leroy looked at me with that nasty sideways grin...
and he said, " lt's a piece of pussy, Long. My very own. "
my face got hot, my breath quickened.
there he was, with this perfect piece of girl, tossing her up in the air.
and l watched, knowing that l had seen God for the first time.
and l wanted her for my very own.
but old Leroy popped his treasure between his teeth...
jumped on his bike grinning at me, and rode off...
leaving us in a cloud of dust and desire.
and it was in that tormented haze, at the age of 10...
when l dedicated the rest of my life...
to finding my very own tiny piece of love and wonder...
that l could carry with me for eternity.
all right, that's it. l'm going home.
to Florida?
now, look, be careful.
we cannot tear out a single page of our lives...
but we can throw the whole book in the fire."
george Sand.
l thought that would be a hard one.
l don't feel right about lying to her.
what would a teenage hussy want with this place, anyway?
said herself it was a shithole. She's better off.
besides, when you sell that book, everything will change
change?
we'll go to Paris, drink '61 Latour...
write bad poetry. Yes, everything will be just perfect.
we die only once, and for such a long time. "
Molière.
she's here, honey.
l'll take better care of her this time.
see you tomorrow, darling.
your mama used to come here a lot.
why do you talk about her so much?
because l miss her, l guess.
were you in love with her or something?
we all loved her.
she knew how to reach people, you know? - No, not really.
the night before my grandma died...
she warned me that Lorraine would always be selfish.
she finally told me about my father.
she did, did she?
some sax player in Memphis.
pretty much a one-night stand.
l think Gran wanted me to know that when she was gone, l'd be totally on my own.
she was right.
after she died, l hardly ever heard from Lorraine.
never even got a chance to hear her sing.
your mama loved you, you know? You meant the world to her.
she used to sit right where you're sitting now.
always writing.
called this granddaddy the Tree of Life.
that's so corny.
you're in the wrong appliance. - What?
to succeed in killing oneself, one must be in the oven.
God damn, girl. You woke up productive.
come see what Pursey did. - Christ. Stop yelling.
l see what she didn't do: leave.
she ain't gonna leave.
that's a really good look for you, too.
good morning to y'all, too.
no school, l hear. What, you skip a grade?
a few. The 10th, 11th, and 12th. Do you mind?
God, we are living under the same roof as a goddamn dropout.
lt takes one to mock one. At least l can support myself.
look, as long as you're not lazing around here...
making Lawson lose his concentration, l do not care what you do.
you got work to do.
do you have to go after her like that, relentlessly?
do you want her to stick around? ls that what you want?
has it ever occurred to you that if we help her get on her feet, she might move on?
how help her?
you want to help her out of them tight little pants. That's what you want.
forget it, man, all right? - Forgotten.
a New OrIeans summer drowns in thick, dank stiIIness.
come on, man, let's play gin.
can't you see us doing something here? - To hell with you.
Lorraine's house shrank with each passing day, straining uneasy waIIs cIoser.
turn that music off, girl! Can't you see he's working?
Jesus H. Christ.
how long you gonna sit around here smoking up our cigarette money?
Lawson said he didn't mind.
Lawson's cigarettes are red. Mine are green.
you may not smoke green. Bobby's.
what is that shit you are drinking? God, it reeks.
this is beer and tomato juice.
breakfast of champions.
champion fuckup, maybe.
you know, girl, l have had just about enough of your bad attitude.
whether you like it or not, l am the senior male in this house...
and you will respect me!
we have been very patient out of respect for Lorraine...
but you will not continue to lay around here...
and play parasite to our generosity.
now, you must work as if you're gonna live 100 years...
and pray as if you're gonna die tomorrow.
what did you say? - Ben Franklin said it.
lt probably meant something coming from him.
you know damn well l've been looking for a job.
God, what do you do? Except shit around and talk about how smart you used to be.
l am a professor. l am a troubadour. A poet.
and it's none of your damn business how we live.
you are responsible for your share. -My share?
you already live in my house for free.
God, you should be grateful-- -This is our house!
maybe you'd rather l earn money bringing friends home.
didn't Lorraine have to do that for a while? Most junkies do.
God damn it!
have you no respect for the dead?
that was your mother, Pursey.
besides...
we all know that you ain't no angel of purity...
are you, little Purslane?
did you ever have two men at once? Have you?
that would buy a lot of cigarettes in our house. lt would, wouldn't it?
fuck you!
you're supposed to be the senior male? The grownup.
l'm just a girl. Don't you get that?
l'm so sick of your high and mighty attitude about poor, dead Lorraine.
you wanna teach me about respect? Who respects you?
the wife who's smart enough to get rid of you, or the kids you never fucking see?
what did I tell you about her?
Oh, God!
you know, l know what y'all think of me.
school just seemed like a waste of time. - lt's not.
I know that. I'm not some dumb kid, you know.
l wanna be normal. lt's just not my life.
what is your life? What do you want?
lf l could do anything?
promise you won't laugh?
l don't know if l can promise.
well, l thought about maybe working in a hospital or something...
like being an x-ray technician or something like that.
okay.
can l ask why? - I don't know.
l like the way bones look on a light box.
they're like portraits, but on the inside.
l know it does sound totally stupid.
no, it's not stupid.
Hello?
HeIIo? Is anyone there?
sorry. - lt's all right.
l keep forgetting there's a woman in the house.
any sign of him?
listen, Pursey, l need to tell you something.
what, you worried about him?
what are you doing today?
I thought I'd go down to the Quarter...
look for a job. I haven't tried there yet.
want someone to show you around?
give us a call next week. - All right, thanks.
well?
maybe, but only part-time.
lt's not like you have rent. You don't have to work full-time.
I need to get away from Bobby full-time. Overtime.
maybe l could help you get started on those bone portraits.
you can get your GED, you know.
sure I can. Then maybe I can go to Harvard.
maybe.
you know, you eat like shit?
you drink too much.
okay.
would you let me read your book sometime?
I don't think so. - Why not?
most of it ends up in the trash. - How long you been writing it?
too long, and not long enough.
did you graduate from college? -Yes, ma'am, I did.
with the privilege of becoming Bobby Long's teaching assistant.
why did y'all leave that school?
lt's complicated. So many reasons.
tell me one.
a lot happened real fast...
and New Orleans, all this...
it sort of seemed romantic at the time.
ls it?
ls it romantic?
lt has its moments.
would you really help me get my GED?
Yes, I really would.
Why? - Why not?
don't have anything else to do.
would you quit drinking so much?
Why?
why not? You don't have anything else to do.
all right.
all right.
so, where is he, the son of a bitch?
probably on some barstool somewhere, whining about how misunderstood he is.
you've better things to do than waste another day worrying about Bobby Long.
he didn't. We had a nice day, didn't we?
Yeah.
come on, darling, we better get home.
see you at home.
lt must be getting pretty crowded for you, only two rooms.
what about your work, sugar? There's no privacy there.
you could stay at my place.
will you think about it?
I'm back.
aren't you people glad to see me?
no. - You might have called.
well, then ask me. Say:
Bobby, what have you brought me?
man, where's my car? - I sold it.
now, Pursey, go put some music on. We're gonna celebrate.
you what? - I sold it. We didn't need a car.
this is a single malt. When was the last time you had a single malt?
for how much? - $300.
you fucking sold my car for fucking $300?
have you lost your goddamn mind completely?
just hold that punch.
now, you remember...
l have a broken face.
now, l didn't have any money.
that's because your check is here.
and this, too. From the lawyer. It's time to tell her.
l waited for you to get the... What the fuck are you doing?
you give me five minutes, and then you do what you think is right.
well, look how nice you changed everything.
I'd have destroyed that TV weeks ago if I'd known it would drive you to Steinbeck.
all right, now, I have something to tell y'all.
come on in, sit down.
come on, man, sit...
will you stop grieving about that hunk of shit and sit down?
I'll stand.
all right, close your eyes.
close your eyes, man. - I'm not closing my goddamn eyes.
come on, Lawson. Christ.
all right, now.
you can open them now, darling.
courtesy of a lovely teacher...
to certify that Purslane Hominy Will...
'has successfully completed the 1 1th grade...
and is recommended to the 12th grade.
why stay we on earth except to grow?
he's definitely your run-of-the-mill senior-year poet.
is this really your idea of an apology...
or are you just trying to one-up his GED offer?
great minds.
come on, man. Of course she takes a language.
you want to speak French, don't you? - Don't be an ass.
you know that she can't take French 1 as a senior.
all right.
so we got English Lit, European History, Geography, Psychology.
we need one more.
l think Art Appreciation. - Music.
l think she'd like music. -l'm not going.
well, God damn, it's already set up.
do you know how much I had to go through for you for this?
for me? You expect me to... Come on. What's in it for you?
firstly, it'll get you out of the house, for my sanity.
that's whatI thought. - No, look.
you said something to me recently. lt got me thinking.
you said, "l'm just a girl."
maybe l've grown too calloused over the years, but you are just a girl.
not unlike the students that flowed through my classes years ago.
and l know that we must seem horrible to you...
but we still got something to offer. We must.
and besides, l think we owe it to your mother.
and as hard is it is to believe...
we, too, once were innocent children.
you are such a shameless ham.
what makes you think l could do this?
because we know God, and God knows us.
and he and Lorraine brought you here for a reason.
school starts in a month.
you can give us a chance. lt might be fun.
"fun" is a stretch, don't you think?
listen, sweetheart, that's one of your mama's songs.
that's beautiful.
she'd be so proud.
what do you think of my face?
see this bone? lt's broken.
but you can move it.
how'd that happen?
"never fight fair with a stranger." Arthur Miller.
that happened in a fight? You lost?
well, l lost a lot more than the fight.
does it take away from my appearance, in your opinion, miss?
l think you're still handsome.
well, aren't y'all sweet?
are you having sexual intercourse with one another?
okay, Dr. Ruth, let's go. - lt's all right if you are.
sex is nice.
just remember to be kind to one another.
and stay young as long as you can. Your youth is fleeting. Be kind.
we should start with memorization.
I think we should stick to the Socratic method.
you do? Just exactly who is Plato and who is Socrates...
in this arrangement? Because I'll just stay out.
you are Socrates, of course.
you are the Teacher. - You're goddamn right I am.
l wish y'all would just shut up...
because if it's gonna be like this, I ain't learning nothing.
girl, your English is fucking atrocious.
purslane Hominy, sit up.
why can't I study in bed?
it's so hot, and this chair is so uncomfortable.
it is not supposed to be comfortable. It'll put your brain to sleep. Sit up.
it's just bad habits. - You're talking to me about bad habits?
don't fuck with the Teacher, okay?
just tell me what is Nebraska's role in American Literature? Go.
shouldn't I be learning the state capitals? - Bullshit. You'll learn what matters.
don't procrastinate. - By whatever do you mean?
I don't have a card for procrastinate.
you are just incorrigible.
procrastinate.
to drag one's ass in such a pathetic manner...
as to ensure one's place in life as a loser. "
Hey, who are you calling a loser?
fuck. - Go.
all right, Nebraska.
home state of Willa Cather, one of our first successful female authors.
or should I move east to Missouri, where Mark Twain...
alias Samuel Clemens, was born, or down south to Kansas...
where William Burroughs spent his last years?
stop! - Hey, man...
I don't think they'll teach Burroughs at Catholic school.
well, they ought to.
why don't you pour your old buddy a drink?
we're out of juice. - Well, what's in that glass?
lt doesn't have a smell.
well, God damn it, pour some vodka in it then.
go ahead. - We gotta quit.
I promised Pursey if she'd study. I mean, look at us. We're worthless.
and when was that, that you quit?
nineteen hours ago, when we were quizzing.
did you get some sleep? - No.
there's no rush for her or for us...
so if you want to quit, take it slow.
now, trust me on this.
take away the bottle, take away the genie.
Hey, what are you doing here?
l just thought l'd give Lawson a break.
let him use the bedroom. Come on, sit down.
you look very pretty today, Purslane.
no one calls me that but my dead grandmother, but thanks.
now, you remember how to get there?
l know where it is all right, so l guess l should be going.
you nervous?
no.
Yeah.
want me to take the streetcar with you?
no, I'll be okay.
well, I know you'll just do fine.
and we'll be right here when you get back from school...
to help you with your homework.
Christ, you're really living in some parallel universe.

lt's about to become you and "tardy" in the same sentence, so...

where else would a teenage girl go but straight home...
to her endlessly entertaining middle-aged roommates?
she's no picnic. Tortures me with that noise.
that child should know anything worth listening to is on vinyl.
my kids knew it.
I taught them. I was their father.
you still are.
one day they'll understand, when you finish that book.
my kids don't even know me.
shit, can we do anything besides this?
like what? - Fuck if I know.
we could go fishing. - You don't fish.
maybe I should start something.
maybe you should start working on your damn book.
I don't know the end of the story yet.
checkmate. Let's get out of here. We're depressing me.
you know, I wanna say something...
about life, because an unexamined life is simply a life. - Not worth living.
purslane, our prodigy has returned.
now, tell us everything.
honey, why did you leave school early?
I didn't belong there.
I appreciate what y'all are doing, but I'm not going back.
what?
I really need a job.
you can work here on the weekends, sugar. - Really?
only if you're in school, though. - Good one, Earl.

based on the play by William Shakespeare
now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour draws on apace.
four happy days bring in another moon.
but, O, methinks how slow this old moon wanes!
she lingers my desires like to a stepdame or a dowager, long withering out a young man's revenue.
four days will quickly steep themselves in night, four nights will quickly dream away the time.
and then the moon, like to a silver bow new bent in heaven, shall behold the night of our solemnities.
happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!
Thanks, good Egeus. What's the news with thee?
full of vexation come I, with complaint against my child, my daughter Hermia.
stand forth, Demetrius.
my noble lord, this man hath my consent to marry her.
stand forth, Lysander.
this man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.
thou, thou Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes, and interchanged love tokens with my child!
with cunning hast thou filched my daughter's heart, turned her obedience, which is due to me, to stubborn harshness.
and, my gracious Duke, be it so she will not here before Your Grace consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
as she is mine, I may dispose of her.
and that shall be either... to this gentleman, or to her death, according to our law immediately provided in that case.
what say you, Hermia?
relent, sweet Hermia.
and Lysander, yield thy crazed title to my certain right.
you have her father's love, Demetrius - let me have Hermia's.
do you marry him.
scornful Lysander!
true, he hath my love.
and what is mine, my love shall render him.
and she is mine!
and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius.
I am, my lord, as well derived as he, as well possessed.
my love is more than his.
and, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.
why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head, made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena.
and won her soul.
and she, sweet lady, dotes.
devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry, upon this spotted and inconstant man.
I must confess I have heard so much.
I do entreat Your Grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold, nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts.
but I beseech Your Grace that I may know the worst that may befall me in this case.
either to die the death, or to abjure for ever the society of men.
therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires.
know of your youth. Examine well your blood.
whether, if you yield not to your father's choice, you can endure the livery of a nun.
for, aye, to be in shady cloister mewed, to live a barren sister all your life, chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.
so will I grow, so live, so die, my lord, ere I will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty.
take time to pause.
by the next new moon, upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your father's will, or else to wed Demetrius, as he would.
or on Diana's altar to protest for, aye, austerity and single life.
for you, fair Hermia,
look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your father's will.
come, Hippolyta.
Demetrius, come. And come, Egeus.
I have some private schooling for you both.
how now, my love?
why is your cheek so pale?
how chance the roses there do fade so fast?
belike for want of rain,...
which I could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
ay me!
for aught that I could ever read, could ever hear by tale or history, the course of true love never did run smooth.
if there were a sympathy in choice, war, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, making it momentary as a sound, swift as a shadow, short as any dream, as brief as the lightning in the collied night, that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth, and ere a man hath power to say "Behold!," the jaws of darkness do devour it up.
so quick bright things come to confusion.
therefore hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager of great revenue, and she respects me as her only son.
Demetrius!
Demetrius!
Demetrius!
Demetrius!
how happy some o'er other some can be.
through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
but what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.
he will not know what all but he do know.
love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
God speed, fair Helena! Whither away?
call you me fair?
that fair, again, unsay! Demetrius loves your fair.
o... happy fair!
sickness is catching, O, were favour so.
yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
o, teach me how you look, and with what art you sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!
his folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
none but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!
take comfort: he no more shall see my face.
Lysander and myself shall fly this place.
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass, a time that lovers' flights doth still conceal, through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
and thence from Athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies.
Hermia! - Oh...
Hermia!
farewell, sweet playfellow.
pray thou for us.
and good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.
Hermia! - Oh...
keep word, Lysander. - I will, my Hermia.
Helena, adieu.
as you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
Oh, spite!
Oh, hell!
citizens of Monte Athena A Dramatic Competition to celebrate the wedding of Grand Duke Theseus, A small pension will be awarded to the winners.
Where's my husband? Where's that worthless dreamer?
is all our company here?
here, Peter Quince.
you were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
here, here. Here.
here is the scroll of every man's name which is thought fit, through all our town, to play in our interlude before the Duke and Duchess on his wedding day at night.
first, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.
marry, our play is...
"the most lamentable comedy and cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe."
a very good piece of work, I assure you - and a merry.
now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.
masters... spread yourselves.
so, answer as I call you.
Nick Bottom, the weaver? - Ready.
name what part I am for, and proceed.
you, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
what is Pyramus? A lover or a tyrant?
a lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
that will ask some tears in the true performing of it.
if I do it, let the audience look to their eyes
I will move storms.
I will condole in some measure.
now to the rest. - Well...
yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely.
or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split. - Francis Flute...
the raging rocks and shivering shocks
shall break the locks of prison gates.
and Phibbus' car shall shine from fa-aa-ar
and make and mar the foolish fates.
this was lofty!
Ah... Pyramus.
Francis Flute, the bellows-mender? - Here, Peter Quince.
Francis Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.
what is Thisbe? A wandering knight?
it is the lady that Pyramus must love.
nay, faith, let not me play a woman. I have a beard coming.
and I may hide my face. Let me play Thisbe too.
I'll speak in a monstrous little voice: "Thisne, Thisne.
Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe dear, and lady dear!
Ah... - No, no! You must play Pyramus.
snout. And Flute, you Thisbe.
Robin Starveling, the tailor? - Here, Peter Quince.
snug the joiner, you, the lion's part.
and I hope we have a play well fitted.
have you the lion's part written?
pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
no, you may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
let me play the lion too.
I will roar that I will do any man's heart good to hear me.
I will roar that I will make the Duke say "Let him roar again, let him roar again!
no, you should do it too terribly that you would fright the Duchess and the ladies and they would shriek - and that were enough to hang us all.
I grant you, friends, if I should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us.
but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove.
I will roar you an't were any nightingale.
you can play no part but Pyramus.
Pyramus is a sweet-faced man.
a proper man as one shall see in a summer's day. A most lovely, gentleman-like man.
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
well...
I will undertake it.
masters, you have all your parts, and I am to entreat you to con them by tomorrow night and to meet in the palace wood, a mile without the town - there will we rehearse.
if we meet in the city, we will be dogged by company and our devices known.
I pray you, fail me not.
we will meet.
and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously.
take pains. Be perfect!
adieu.
ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne, he hailed down oaths that he was only mine.
and when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, so he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight.
then to the wood this very night will he pursue her.
how now, spirit.
whither wander you?
over hill, over dale, through bush, through briar, over park, over pale, through flood, through fire,
I do wander everywhere.
swifter than the moon's sphere.
and I serve the fairy queen, to dew her orbs upon the green.
either I mistake your shape and making quite, or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow.
are not you he, that frights the maidens of the villagery?
skims milk, and sometimes labours in the quern, and bootless makes the breathless housewife churn - are not you he?
thou speak'st aright. I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile, when I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, neighing in likeness of a filly foal.
and sometimes...
farewell, thou lob of spirits!
I'll be gone.
the queen and all her elves come here anon.
the king doth keep his revels here tonight
take heed the queen come not within his sight.
for Oberon is passing fell and wrath.
Ill-met by moonlight, proud Titania.
what, jealous Oberon?
fairies, skip hence: I have forsworn his bed and company.
tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?
then I must be thy lady.
why art thou here, come from the farthest step of India, but that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon, your buskined mistress and your warrior love, to Theseus must be wedded, and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity.
how canst thou thus, for shame, Titania, glance at my credit with Hippolyta, knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
these are the forgeries of jealousy.
and never, since the middle summer's spring met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead, by paved fountain, or by rushy brook, but with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.
therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, as in revenge have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs, which, falling in the land, hath every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents.
and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate, from our dissension.
we are their parents and original.
do you amend it, then.
it lies in you.
why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman.
set your heart at rest:
the fairy land buys not the child of me.
his mother was a votaress of my order, and in the spiced Indian air, by night full often hath she gossiped by my side.
and sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands, marking the embarked traders on the flood, when we have laughed to see the sails conceive and grow big-bellied with the wanton wind.
but she, being mortal, of that boy did die.
and for her sake do I rear up her boy.
and for her sake I will not part with him.
how long within this wood intend you stay?
perchance till after Theseus' wedding day.
if you will patiently dance in our round, and see our moonlight revels, go with us.
give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
not for thy fairy kingdom!
fairies, away!
we shall chide downright if I longer stay.
well, go thy way.
thou shalt not from this grove till I torment thee for this injury.
my gentle Puck, come hither.
thou rememb'rest since once I sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back, uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath...
that the rude sea grew civil at her song?
that very time I saw - but thou couldst not
flying between the cold moon and the earth, Cupid all armed.
and loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow.
yet, marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
it fell upon a little western flower
before, milk-white, now purple with love's wound.
fetch me that flower.
the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.
fetch me this herb, and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league.
I'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes.
having once this juice, I'll watch Titania when she is asleep, and drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
the next thing then she waking looks upon, she shall pursue it with the soul of love.
and ere I take this charm from off her sight, I'll make her render up her page to me.
I love thee not, therefore pursue me not!
where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood, and here am I, and wood within this wood, because I cannot meet my Hermia!
hence! Get thee gone and follow me no more!
do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
or rather, do I not in plainest truth tell you I do not, nor I cannot, love you?
and even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel.
and, Demetrius, the more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
use me but as your spaniel
spurn me, strike me, neglect me, lose me, but give me leave, unworthy as I am, to follow you.
what worser place can I beg in your love than to be used as you use your dog?!
tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit, for I am sick when I do look on thee.
and I am sick when I look not on you!
you do impeach your modesty too much!
to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not.
to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place...
with the rich worth of your virginity.
your virtue is my privilege.
for that it is not night when I do see your face, therefore I think I am not in the night.
nor doth this wood lack worlds of company, for you, in my respect, are all the world.
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts!
the wildest hath not such a heart as you!
run when you will. The story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase!
the dove pursues the griffin!
I will not stay thy questions! Let me go!
or, if thou follow me, do not believe but I shall do thee mischief in the wood!
ay, in the temple, in the town, in the field you do me mischief!
Fie, Demetrius!
your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex!
we cannot fight for love, as men may do.
we should be wooed, and were not made to woo.
I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell, to die upon the hand I love so well.
fare thee well, nymph.
ere he shall leave this grove, thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
hast thou the flower there?
Ah...
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, with sweet musk roses and with eglantine.
there sleeps Titania sometime of the night, lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.
and there the snake throws her enamelled skin, weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.
and with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, and make her full of hateful fantasies.
take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.
a sweet Athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes.
but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady.
thou shalt know the man by the Athenian garments he hath on.
and look...
thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
fear not, my lord. Your servant shall do so.
sing me now asleep.
then to thy offices and let me rest.
hence away. Now all is well. One aloof stand sentinel.
what thou seest when thou dost wake, do it for thy true love take.
love and languish for his sake.
be it ounce, or cat, or bear, pard, or boar with bristled hair, in thy eye that doth appear when thou waks't, it is thy dear.
wake when some vile thing is near.
fair love...
you faint with wandering in the wood.
and to speak truth, I have forgot our way.
we'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good, and tarry for the comfort of the day.
be it so, Lysander.
well, find you out a bed, for I upon this bank shall rest my head.
Lysander!
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both.
one heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.
nay, good Lysander. For my sake, my dear, lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
o take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit, so that but one heart we can make of it.
two bosoms interchained with an oath, so, then, two bosoms and a single troth.
then by your side no bed-room me deny, for lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
Lysander riddles very prettily.
nay, gentle friend.
for love and courtesy, lie further off!
in human modesty!
such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.
so far be distant.
and good night, sweet friend.
thy love ne'er alter, till thy sweet life end! - Amen.
Amen to that fair prayer, say I. And then, end life, when I end loyalty.
here is my bed. Sleep give thee all his rest.
with half that wish, the wisher's eyes be pressed.
through the forest have I gone, but Athenian found I none on whose eyes I might approve this flower's force in stirring love.
night... and silence.
but who is here?
weeds of Athens he doth wear!
this is he my master said despised the Athenian maid!
and there the maiden, sleeping sound on the dank and dirty ground.
pretty soul.
she durst not lie near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
churl, upon thy eyes I throw all the power this charm doth owe.
when thou wak'st, let love forbid sleep his seat on thy eyelid.
and so awake when I am gone, for I must now... to Oberon!
I charge thee hence! And do not haunt me thus!
would thou darkling leave me? Do not so!
stay - on thy peril. I alone will go!
o, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
the more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies, for she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
how came her eyes so bright?
not with salt tears
if so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.
no.
no, no, no.
I am as ugly... as a bear.
for beasts that meet me run away for fear.
Lysander?!
dead or asleep?
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake!
Oh.
and run through fire I will for thy sweet sake!
where is Demetrius?
o how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword!
do not say so, Lysander! Say not so!
what, though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
yet Hermia still loves you - then be content.
content with Hermia?!
No! I do repent the tedious minutes I with her have spent!
not Hermia, but Helena I love.
who will not change a raven for a dove?
wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
when at your hands did I deserve such scorn?!
is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, that I did never, no, nor never can, deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye, but you must flout my insufficiency?
but fare you well!
perforce, I must confess...
I thought you lord of more true gentleness!
she sees not Hermia.
Hermia, sleepst thou there, and never mayst thou come Lysander near!
and, all my powers, address your love and might to honour Helen, and to be her knight!
ay me!
for pity, what a dream was here!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.
Lysander?
Lysander?
Lysander?!
here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal.
this green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house.
and we will... do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke.
Peter Quince? - What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
there are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe. - Thisbe that will never please.
first, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide.
by Our Lady, a parlous fear.
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
not a whit. I have a device to make all well.
write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.
and, for the more better assurance, tell them...
that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver.
this will put them out of fear.
Ah, well, we will have such a prologue. And it shall be written in eight and six.
no, make it two more - let it be written in eight and eight.
but there is two hard things:...
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber, for, you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
a calendar. A calendar!
look in the almanac, find out moonshine.
it doth shine that night. It doth shine that night.
why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window open, where we play, and the moon may shine in at the casement.
two hard things - we must have a wall in the great chamber.
for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall.
you can never bring in a wall!
what say you, Bottom?
some... man or other must present Wall.
snout. Snout.
and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some roughcast about him, to signify Wall.
and let him hold his fingers thus...
and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe. - Thisbe whisper.
you can never bring in a wall. - And if this may be, then all is well.
Pyramus, you begin, and when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake.
Thisbe, stand forth.
left foot forward, and then antique gesture.
Pyramus, speak.
what hempen homespuns have we swaggering here, so near the cradle of the fairy queen?
line? - "Thisbe."
Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet...
Odorous. Odorous.
odorous savours sweet, so hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.
but hark! A voice!
stay thou but here a while, and by and by I will to thee appear.
a stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
Psst. Must I speak now?
ay, marry, must you
for he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
most radiant... - Most radiant...
most radiant...
most radiant Pyramus, most...
lily-white of hue...
if I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine...
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
that's "Ninus' tomb," man!
why, you must not speak that yet - that you answer to Pyramus.
you speak all your part at once, cues and all.
enter Pyramus!
your cue is past. It is "never tire."
if I were fair, Thisbe... If I were fair, Thisbe...
if I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine...
o, monstrous! O, strange! Fly, masters!
we are haunted!
bottom, thou art changed. What do I see on thee?!
what do you see? What, you see an ass-head of your own, do you?
bless thee, Bottom, bless thee! Thou art translated!
why do they run away?
I see their knavery!
this is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if they could.
but I will not stir from this place, do what they can.
and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.
♪ The ousel cock, so black of hue ♪ With orange-tawny bill ♪ The throstle with his note so true ♪ The wren with little qui-ii-ill
what angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
♪ The finch, the sparrow, and the lark, the plain-song cuckoo grey ♪ Whose note, full many a man doth mark ♪ And dares not answer na-aa-ay
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
mine ear is much enamoured of thy note.
so is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.
and thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me on the first view, to say...
to swear, I love thee.
methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.
and yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together nowadays.
nay, I can gleek upon occasion!
thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
not so, neither.
if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
out of this wood do not desire to go!
thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee.
and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, and sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep.
and I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go!
Peaseblossom! Cobweb!
ready. - And I.
moth, and Mustardseed!
and I. - And I.
where shall we go?
be kind and courteous to this gentleman.
hop in his walks, and gambol in his eyes.
feed him with apricocks and dewberries, with purple grapes, green figs and mulberries.
nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
I cry your worship's mercy heartily. I beseech your worship's name?
cobweb.
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Cobweb.
if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.
your name, I pray you?
Mustardseed.
Ah, I know your patience well. Your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now.
I shall desire you of more acquaintance, Mustardseed.
hail, mortal.
hail, mortal.
hail, mortal.
hail. Hail. Hail.
I wonder if Titania be awaked, and what it was that next came in her eye, which she must dote on in extremity.
how now, mad spirit. What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
my mistress with a monster is in love.
this falls out better than I could devise.
but hast thou yet latched the Athenian's eyes with the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
I took him sleeping - that is finished too. - Rebuke you him that loves you so.
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe. - Stand close.
now I but chide! But I should use thee worse, for thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.
if thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep, being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep and kill me too!
this is the same Athenian.
this is the woman. But not this the man.
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me!
would he have stolen away from sleeping Hermia?
where is he?
good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds!
out, dog! Out, cur!
thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden's patience.
and hast thou killed him while sleeping? O brave touch!
could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
you spend your passion on a misprised mood! I am not guilty of Lysander's blood!
nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
and if I could, what should I get therefore?
a privilege - never to see me more!
there is no following her in this fierce vein.
here, therefore, for a while I will remain.
what hast thou done?! Thou hast mistaken quite, and laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight!
about the woods go swifter than the wind, and Helena of Athens look thou find.
by some illusion look thou bring her here.
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
I go, I go! Look how I go!
swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow!
the moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye, and when she weeps, weeps every little flower, lamenting some enforced chastity.
come, lead him to my bower.
tie up my love's tongue. Bring him silently.
flower of this purple dye, hit with Cupid's archery, sink in apple of his eye.
when his love he doth espy, let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky.
when thou ask'st, if she be by, beg of her for remedy.
captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand, and the youth - mistook by me - pleading for a lover's fee.
shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord, what fools these mortals be!
why do you think that I should woo in scorn?
scorn and derision never come in tears!
look!
when I vow, I weep!
and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears!
how can these things in me seem scorn to you, bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?
you do advance your cunning more and more.
when truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
these vows are Hermia's! Will you give her o'er?
weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh!
I had no judgement when to her I swore!
nor none in my mind, now you give her o'er.
Demetrius loves her. And he loves not you!
Helen...
goddess!
Nymph!
perfect. Divine.
to what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne? Crystal is muddy!
o how ripe in show thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
Helen!
o spite! O hell!
I see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment!
can you not hate me, as I know you do, but you must join in souls to mock me too?
Helen! Helen, it's not so!
Helen!
Oh... Lysander!
Lysander! Love!
why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
what love could press Lysander from my side?
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide.
why seek'st thou me?
could not this make thee know the hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
you speak not as you think - it cannot be!
lo, she is one of this confederacy!
injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid!
have you conspired?
have you, with these, contrived to bait me with this foul derision?!
is all the counsel that we two have shared, the sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us
o, is all forgot?
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend?
it is not friendly! 'Tis not maidenly!
our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it, though I alone do feel the injury!
I understand not what you mean by this.
ay, do.
Persever. Counterfeit sad looks.
make mouths upon me when I turn my back.
if you have any pity, grace, or manners, you would not make me such an argument!
but fare you well.
tis partly my own fault, which death or absence soon shall remedy.
Helena, I love thee! By my life, I do!
o, excellent! - Sweet, do not scorn her so!
I say I love thee more than he can do!
Lysander, do you not jest?!
Yes, sooth, and so do you!
Ow!
am not I Hermia? I am as fair now as I was erewhile!
why, then you left me in earnest, shall I say?
I never did desire to see thee more.
be certain, nothing truer, 'tis no jest, that I hate thee, and love Helena.
o me!
you... juggler!
you canker-blossom!
you thief of love!
what, have you come by night and stolen my love's heart from him?
o, fine, I'faith!
have you no modesty, no maiden shame, no touch of bashfulness?
what, will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue? Fie!
Fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
"puppet"? Why so?
Ah, that way goes the game.
now I perceive that she hath made compare between our statures!
she hath urged her height, and with her personage, her tall personage, her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him!
and are you grown so... high in his esteem because I am so dwarfish and so low?
well, how low am I, thou painted maypole?
speak! How low am I?
I am not yet so low but that my nails can reach into thine eyes!
o, I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen, do not let her hurt me!
you perhaps may think, because she is somewhat lower than myself, - that I can match her! - "Lower"?! Hark, again!
good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
and now, so you will let me quiet go, to Athens will I bear my folly back, and follow you no further.
let me go. You see how simple and how fond I am.
why, get you gone! Who is it hinders you?
a foolish heart, that I do leave here behind.
what, with Lysander?! - With Demetrius!
be not afraid, she shall not harm thee, Helena.
no, sir, she shall not, though you take her part!
she was a vixen when she went to school, and though she be but little, she is fierce!
little?! Little again?! Nothing but "low" and "little"?!
why will you suffer her to flout me thus? Let me come to her!
get you gone, you dwarf! You minimus, of hindering knotgrass made!
you bead, you acorn!
now she holds me not.
now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
follow? Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl!
you, mistress... all this coil is 'long of you.
nay, go not back.
I will not trust you, I, nor longer stay in your curst company.
your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.
my legs longer, though, to run away!
I am amazed, and know not what to say!
this is thy negligence!
still, still, still thou mistak'st! Or else...
believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
did not you tell me I would know the man...
by the Athenian garments that he had on?
thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.
HIE, therefore, Robin, overcast the night.
the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog, as black as Acheron, and lead these... these testy rivals so astray that one come not within the other's way.
then crush this herb into Lysander's... Lysander's eye.
whiles I in this affair do thee employ, I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy.
then I will her charmed eye release from monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.
I am feared in field and town. Goblin, lead them up and down!
here comes one.
where art thou, proud Demetrius?
here, villain! Where art thou?
I'll be with thee straight!
Lysander? Speak again!
thou runaway! Thou coward!
art thou fled?!
come, recreant. Come, thou child.
Yea! Art thou there?
follow my voice.
we'll try no manhood here.
Oh, the villain is much lighter-heeled than I.
I followed fast, but faster he did fly.
then fallen am I in dark, uneven way.
and here will rest me.
Oh, come, thou gentle day.
come hither! I am here!
nay, then, thou mock'st me.
thou shalt buy this dear, if ever I thy face by daylight see!
now go thy way.
faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed.
by day's approach... look to be visited.
never so weary.
never so in woe.
I can no further crawl, no further go.
here I will rest me till the break of day.
heavens, shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
o weary night, O long and tedious night, abate thy hours.
shine comforts from the east that I may back to Athens by daylight, from these that my poor company detest.
and sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye, steal me awhile from mine own company.
come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed, while I thy amiable cheeks do coy, and stick musk roses in thy sleek, smooth head, and kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
I must to the barber's.
methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face.
and I am such a tender ass - if my hair do but tickle me, I must scratch.
what, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?
or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat?
truly, a peck of provender. I could munch your good dry oats.
methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.
good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
but I pray you, let none of your people stir me:
I have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
so doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently entwist.
the female ivy so enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
o, how I love thee! How I dote on thee!
on the ground, sleep sound.
I'll apply to your eye, gentle lover, remedy.
when thou wak'st,...
thou tak'st true delight in the sight of thy former lady's eye.
Jack shall have Jill, nought shall go ill, the man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.
welcome, good Robin.
seest thou this sweet sight?
her dotage now I do begin to pity.
I shall undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes.
be as thou wast wont to be.
see... as thou wast wont to see.
now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet Queen.
Oh... My Oberon!
what visions have I seen! Methought I was enamoured of an ass!
there lies your love.
how came these things to pass?!
silence awhile.
fairy King, attend and mark. I do hear the morning lark.
then, my Queen, in silence sad trip we after night's shade.
we the globe can compass soon, swifter than the wandering moon.
come, my lord, and in our flight tell me how it came this night that I sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground.
we will, fair Queen, up to the mountain's top, and mark the musical confusion of hounds, and echo in conjunction.
my hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind, so flewed, so sanded, and their heads are hung with ears.
but soft... What nymphs are these?
my lord, this is my daughter here asleep.
and this, Lysander. This, Demetrius is.
this, Helena - old Nedar's Helena.
I wonder of them being here together.
no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of May
good morrow, friends.
saint Valentine is past. Begin these wood birds but to couple now?
I pray you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies.
how comes this gentle concord in the world, that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity?
my lord, I shall reply amazedly, half sleep, half waking.
but as I think, for truly would I speak, I came with Hermia hither.
our intent was to be gone from Athens, where we might, without the peril of the Athenian law...
enough! My lord, you have heard enough.
I beg the law, the law, upon his head! They would have stolen away.
they would, Demetrius, thereby to have defeated you and me
you of your wife, and me of my consent, of my consent that she should be your wife.
my good lord, I wot not by what power
but by some power it is
my love to Hermia melted as the snow.
and all the faith, the virtue of my heart, the object and the pleasure of mine eye, is only Helena.
fair lovers, you are fortunately met.
Egeus, I will overbear your will.
for in the temple, by and by, with us these couples shall eternally be knit.
away with us to Athens, three and three.
we'll hold a feast in great solemnity!
come, Hippolyta.
when my cue comes, call me and I will answer.
my next is "Most fair Pyramus."
Heigh-ho...
Peter Quince?
flute?
snout the tinker!
Starveling!
God's my life! Stolen hence and left me asleep!
I have had a most rare vision.
I have had a dream
past the wit of man to say what dream it was.
man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream.
methought I was... there is no man can tell what.
methought I was...
and methought I had...
but man is but a patched fool if he will offer to say what methought I had.
the eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream was.
I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream.
it shall be called "Bottom's dream."
because it hath no bottom.
and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke.
Peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death.
have you sent to Bottom's house? Is he come home yet?
he cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
if he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward, doth it?
masters! The Duke is coming from the temple.
and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.
if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men!
o, sweet bully Bottom!
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life!
and the Duke had not given him sixpence for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged. He would have deserved it.
sixpence a day in Pyramus, or nothing.
where are these lads?!
bottom!
where are these hearts?!
o, most happy hour!
masters, I am to discourse wonders, but ask me not what.
let us hear, sweet Bottom. - Not a word of me.
all I will tell you is that the Duke hath dined.
get your apparel together! Every man look o'er his part!
let Thisbe have clean linen.
let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws!
if it please you!
these things seem small and indistinguishable, like far-off mountains turning into cloud.
and I have found my Demetrius, like a jewel, mine own - and not mine own.
tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
more strange than true.
I never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys.
lovers and madmen have such seething brains, such shaping fantasies, that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends.
such tricks hath strong imagination that, if it would but apprehend some joy, it comprehends some bringer of the joy.
but all the story of the night told over, and all their minds transfigured so together, more witnesseth than fancy's images, and grows to something of great constancy.
but howsoever, strange and... admirable.
joy, gentle friends.
joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts.
more than to us, wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
come now, what masques, what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our aftersupper and bedtime?
where is our usual manager of mirth?
here, mighty Theseus.
what revels are in hand?
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
the Battle with the Centaurs', to be sung by an Athenian eunuch to the harp.
yes... - We'll none of that.
the riot of the tipsy Bacchanals, tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.
that is an old device, and it was played when I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
the thrice three Muses, mourning for the death of learning, late deceased in beggary.
now that is some satire, keen and critical, not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
a tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe. Very tragical mirth.
merry and tragical? Tedious and brief?
that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
what are they that do play it?
Hard-handed men, that work in Athens here, which never laboured in their minds till now, and now have toiled their unbreathed memories with the same play against your nuptial.
we will hear it. - No, no, my lord...
I did hear it over, and it is nothing. Nothing in the world.
I will hear that play.
the short and long is our play is preferred.
for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it.
go, bring them in.
moonshine... shall shine in at the casement.
so please Your Grace, the prologue is addressed.
let him approach.
courage, man! Hurry!
in this same interlude it doth befall that I, one Snout by name, present a wall:
and such a wall, as I would have you think, that had in it a crannied hole... or chink, through which the lovers...
through which the lovers...
Pyramus and Thisbe.
Pyramus and Thisbe.
Pyramus and Thisbe!
Pyramus and Thisbe, did whisper often, very secretly.
and this the cranny is, right and sinister, through which the fearful lovers are to... whisper.
would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
it is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse, my lord.
Pyramus draws near the wall - silence.
o grim-looked night!
o night with hue so black!
o night, which ever art when day is not!
o night, O night, alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot!
and thou O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall, that stand'st between her father's ground and mine, thou wall, O wall,
o sweet and lovely wall, show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.
Thanks, courteous wall.
jove shield thee well for this!
but what see I? No Thisbe do I see.
o wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss, cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
the wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
no, in truth, sire, he should not.
"Deceiving me" is Thisbe's cue.
he... she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.
you shall see - it will fall pat, as I told you.
yonder she comes.
o wall, full often hast thou heard my moans, for...
for parting... for parting my fair Pyramus and me.
my ch... cherry lips have often kissed thy stones
thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
I see a voice!
now will I to the chink, to spy and I can hear my Thisbe's face.
Thisbe!
my love! Thou art my love, I think!
think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace, and like Limander am I trusty still.
and I like Helen, till the fates me kill.
o, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all!
wilt thou at Ninny's tomb...
that's Ninus' tomb!
that's Ninus' tomb... meet me straightway?
tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay!
thus have I, wall, my part discharged so, and being done, thus wall away doth go.
Ah, here come two noble beasts in - a man and a lion.
you, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, may now, perchance, both quake and tremble here when Lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
for know that I as Snug the joiner am a lion fell, nor else no lion's dam.
for if I should as lion come in strife into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
moonshine.
moonshine.
let me play the moon.
this lantern doth the horned moon present.
this lantern doth the horned moon present. Myself, the man in the moon do seem to be.
all I have to say is to tell you that this lantern is the moon,
I'm the man in the moon, this thornbush, my thornbush, and this dog... my dog.
Oh, silence - here comes Thisbe.
where is my love? - Rraahh!
well roared, Lion. - Well run, Thisbe!
well shone, moon.
and then came Pyramus.
sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.
I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright.
for by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.
but stay!
o spite!
but mark, poor knight, what dreadful dole is here?
eyes... do you see?!
how can it be?!
o dainty duck! O dear!
thy mantle good, what, stained with blood?!
approach, ye Furies fell!
o Fates, come, come!
cut thread and thrum!
quail, crush, conclude and quell!
o wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame, since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear?
devoured!
which is... No, no...
which was the fairest dame that lived, that loved, that licked, that liked...
that looked! - that looked with cheer.
come tears, confound!
out, sword, and wound the pap of Pyramus!
ay, that left pap, where heart doth hop.
thus... die I.
thus!
thus!
thus...
now... am I dead.
now am I fled.
no...
my soul... is in the sky.
tongue, lose thy light, moon, take thy flight!
now... die!
die!
die! - Oh, my God...
die!
die...
asleep, my love?
what, dead, my dove?
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh... O Pyramus, arise.

No! I assure you, the wall is down that parted their fathers.

no epilogue, I pray you, for your play needs no excuse.

all right, Lettie. We got a fifteen-minute, uh, wait... 494.
there's an accident working at the spaghetti junction. At 630, but it still will make a very slow go...
a quiet night in a city that knows how to keep its secrets.
but one man is still looking for the answers to life's persistent questions.
that's me.
or it used to be.
it was a rainy Saturday night in St. Paul...
and I had just finished off a grilled cheese sandwich...
with beans for a chaser...
and it was time to head for work across the street.
I'm a private eye.
Noir's the name.
guy Noir.
but I'd taken temporary employment about six years before...
doing security for a radio show called A Prairie Home Companion...
on account of a serious cash-flow problem...
due to a lack of missing heiresses and dead tycoons lying in the solarium with lipstick stains on their smoking jackets.
in other words, I was broke.
this radio show was done out of an old theater called the Fitzgerald...
and it had been on the air since Jesus was in the third grade.
but it was still pulling in a few hundred people on Saturday nights.
it was a live radio variety show, the kind that died fifty years ago...
but somebody forgot to tell them until this night.
a big corporation down in Texas had bought up the radio station...
and their axeman, a guy named Cruett...
was on his way to St. Paul to shut the thing down...
and turn the theater into a parking lot.
it was curtains and everybody knew it, but nobody said so.
they were Midwesterners.
they felt like if you ignored bad news, it might go away.
not my philosophy, but I'm not from here.
stay on the edge of the crowd.
keep your eyes open.
that's my motto.
it was my last night of gainful employment...
and I had a feeling it was maybe going to be interesting.

I was running a raft on the Mississippi...
and carrying people across, and, uh...
it ran into the wake of a steamboat.
Mr. Keillor? We need you on stage.
fine. I'm right there.
is this the story about the guy who ends up hangin' from a kite...
bein' pulled by a boat with his shorts around his ankles?
no. No, it's a different story about a pontoon boat.
Oh! Look at this old house.
good-bye, old house.
good-bye, old porch.
good-bye, old Guy.
Hey, Guy. What are they gonna do with this house, you think? Huh?
I figure it had somethin' to do with the dumpster that showed up yesterday.
Oh, my God. Honey, listen.
I brought you that cute little dress...
I already told you, I don't like the dress.
at least try it on.
I want to see it on you.
you try it on. I don't want to try it on.
it's ugly.
it's the color of vomit.
Oh, sorry.
old man Soderberg was one of those people who was on that raft...
and, uh, he went over the rail and into the river...
and I went in for him 'cause he couldn't swim.
so, I pulled him out.
you saved his life?
well, not really. The river was shallow at that point...
but he didn't know that 'cause I had hold of his ankles.
I was towing him into shore.
Hey! It's good to see ya!

rise and Shine Show. Wilmer Scott, 5 A. M.
me and Dusty used to have an early mornin' show.
is that right? Excuse me, partner.
Oh, yeah. Breakfast at the Bunkhouse.
TV show. And, uh, it showed mostly cartoons and stuff. Remember that?
Oh, yeah? - For the kids.
well, this was... uh, this came on at 5: 00 in the morning.
and it was... uh, like a gospel show.
inspirational show. - Inspirational show.
Wilmer Scott was the host of it.
wasn't Wilmer Scott the famous aviator?
no.
Yeah. First man to fly the length of the Mississippi solo.
no. - I don't think so.
right.
that was his brother Wilbur Scott.
we're now at three minutes...
flew from New Orleans to Memphis...
all the way up to Minnesota to Lake Itasca.
and when he got up there, he tried to fire a signal rocket...
out the cockpit window, but it was closed.
he became the first civilian pilot to shoot himself down.
Ugh! - No. That was Wilbur.
you made that story up. - Right.
no, I'm talking about Wilmer Scott.
crashed into the lake at his moment of triumph.
no. - Wilmer.
Wilmer. Yeah. He was the host... - No. This was the...
right. - The Rise and Shine Show.
rise and Shine.
Mr. Keillor, Al's on the verge of a coronary up there.
Yeah. I'm there.
now, how did he have time to fly and do radio?
G. K. sit down. I gotta do your makeup.
you're thinking of Wilbur Scott, see?
Yeah. It's not the same person. Not the same person.
yeah... - He was dead.
you know, we used to have a dog in the act...
when Wanda and Connie were in it...
and that dog would sing... - Ooo!
we'd sing this old song and he would howl! Ha ha ha!
Oh, my God, that was a dog.
I been thinkin' about him all day long. - Yeah.
rusty always comes to my mind.
does it?
~ Go tell Aunt Gladys ~
~ Go tell Aunt Gladys ~ - That's it!
~ Go tell Aunt Gladys ~
~ The old brown dog is dead ~
~ An old brown dog named Rusty ~
~ An old brown dog named Rusty ~

Oooowww! - How-ow!
I don't know if we were harmonizing with him...
or he was harmonizing with us.
~ Oh, he died from chasin' squirrels ~
ladies and gentlemen...
~ He died from chasin' squirrels ~
this is not a test.
~ He died from chasin' squirrels ~

Oh! - Didn't mean to scare you, Donna.
Wilmer Scott.
let's go. - Garrison!
Wilmer Scott was the one who hypnotized the chickens...
there you go. - On the show.
he did like, what, four of those chickens in a row.
four or five of them. - Who was Wilmer Scott?
he was the host of that Rise and Shine Show.
early in the morning. 5 A. M.
that's, uh, what, uh, G. K. Got started in radio.
right. Gospel show.
and he hypnotized chickens on the radio?
no, but he did the chickens on this show.
on this show?
not on that Rise and Shine Show.
OK.
all right, let's dim the house lights.
you remember when he did those chickens?
hypnotized them? - Yep.
chinese chickens, right?
Kung Pao, I believe.

Uh-huh. OK. - And he lost interest in radio.
check your barn doors.
he developed mic fright.

~ I hear that old piano ~
~ From down the avenue ~
~ I smell the pine trees ~
~ I look around for you ~
~ Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet old someone ~
~ Coming through that door ~
~ It's Saturday and the band is playin' ~
~ Honey, could we ask for more? ~
Hello, everybody, on a Saturday night...
and welcome to a live broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion coming to you...
from WLT, your friendly neighbor station.
Noir, where you been?
I was lookin' after the Johnson Girls.
OK. Aren't you supposed to be guarding the door?
are you worried about something?
uh, I had a weird call from some crazy lady, so...
Oh, she's not that crazy.
how do you know?
because I met her earlier this afternoon.
she came by.
what does she look like? You get a description?
Yeah, I got a description.
yeah?
she was beautiful.
her hair was what God had in mind when he said, let there be...
hair. Right. Hair.
hair. Yeah.
she gave me a smile so sweet...
you could've poured it on your pancakes.
she was wearing a white trench coat so white that rain would be embarrassed to fall on it.
got it. Right.
the skirt she was wearing was so tight...
you could read the embroidery on her underwear.
it said, "Wash in lukewarm water and spin lightly."
OK, you're makin' it up.
she had a Mount Rushmore t-shirt on, and those guys never looked so good.
especially Jefferson and Lincoln.
right.
kind of bloated but happy.
if you know what I mean. - Yeah.
it was an honor just to sit there and inhale the same air that she had so recently exhaled...
just to exchange the atmosphere between us, so to speak.
look, what did she want?
did she say anything about...
who?
the lady.
Oh. She was looking for the Presbyterian Church.
like a dope, I told her where it was.
and out of my life she went, just as...
quickly and erotically as she had entered it.
are you tired of your current herring?
has it lost that certain something that you expect in a pickled fish product?
if so, maybe it's time you try Jens Jenson.
it's the Lake Superior herring that's made the old-fashioned Norwegian way.
c-can someone turn it down, please? Please?
~ Yeah, Jenson Herring is the best ~
Oh, Jens Jenson's.
please. - Ask for it by name.
and if your grocer doesn't stock it, ask him why not.
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna color my hair strawberry blonde.
I swear to God, I should have done it years ago.
I should have broke loose gone to Chicago when Mama died back then.
that's what I should have done.
you know, you put those things off.
you seldom get around to them again.
hmm. What are you writin'?
poem.
Oh, a poem.
what's it about?
Heh. Suicide.
Oh, my God.
Oh. OK.
well, you know what my philosophy is.
Yes, I do, so don't tell me.
I think that you gotta be grateful for everything that happens to you...
because that's what got you here, you know?
and if you hadn't gone through all the things that you went through...
why, you know, you wouldn't have wound up where you are now, so, I don't know.
disappointment doesn't get you anywhere.
anywhere.
aren't you wonderful?
well, one door closes and another one opens...
then, you know, everything is a step along the way...
and it all leads to something else.
pardon me if I don't get down on my knees.
well, that's what I think.
Ahem. Read me some of your poem.
it's not finished.
OK.
soliloquy for a Blue Guitar.
death is easy...
like jumping into the big, blue air...
and waving hello to God.
God is love...
but he doesn't necessarily drop everything...
to catch you, does he?
so, when you hook the hose up to your tailpipe...
don't expect to wake up and get toast for breakfast.
the toast is you.
Hey, what was the name of that song?
well, did you like it?
I won't be loanin' you my car any time soon.
hose to the tailpipe.
thank you so much.
I want to come in here and sing a song for you...
called Slow Days of Summer.
send this out to all the friends in my little hometown up north of here up on the river.
~ Slow days of summer ~
~ In this old town ~
~ Sun goes across the sky ~
~ Sometimes a car goes by ~
~ There's one right now ~
~ Looks like a Chevy ~
~ Your Chevy's blue ~
~ This Chevy's white and brown ~
~ It doesn't slow down ~
~ This looks like new ~
~ You said you'd be here ~
~ Someday yourself ~
~ Maybe by Saturday ~
~ If you can get away ~
~ You'll let me know ~
you came back.
I did.
the Presbyterians weren't who you were looking for?
no, Mr. Noir.
I was sent here.
what can I do for you?
really nothing.
I'll take care of it.
you have a nice show here, Mr. Noir.
Thanks. We like it.
do you believe in the fullness of time and the spirit?
most people don't, you know.
it would be good, Mr. Noir, if you would open your heart...
to the fullness of time and the spirit...
which upholds and sustains us all through this world. Amen.
whatever you say.
~ Waiting for love to come ~
~ All is alive ~
~ Birds sing with angel tongues ~
~ Small stones like diamonds ~
~ All down the drive ~
~ Around the corner, an old dog appears ~
~ Sits in the summer sun ~
~ Waiting for love to come ~
~ Wish you were here ~
~ Wish you were here ~
thank you, boys.
and the next week, we're back doin' the county fair circuit...
changin' our petticoats in the ladies' toilet...
and the boys tryin' to peek in.
that was the only good part about it.
then you have to go outdoors and sing in the open air...
with a cloud of mosquitoes around your head.
remember that time... honestly, Lola, honest to God...
a dragonfly flew right in my mouth.
it was this big. I thought it was a bird.
how old were you then?
I was thirteen. Your mother was ten.
Wanda was what?
Wanda was sixteen. Connie, fifteen.
that was the end of it. The end of the road.
that was a great...
you know, Wanda took it real hard, didn't she?
a week later, she got arrested.
for what? You never told me this.
shoplifting, and I did tell you this.
mom, you're going senile. You didn't tell me that.
no...
she was havin' a cup of coffee in the cafe.
she ordered a glazed doughnut.
she started eatin' it and she got a sugar rush.
she was diagnosed hypoglycemic.
and so, she forgets she didn't pay for the doughnut...
and she walks out the door.
it wasn't two minutes... - But they arrested her for shopliftin'.
the red lights are flashin' and she's in handcuffs...
and they had a policeman there. - And the cameras, the TV camera...
the station came right down. - It was on the news.
and her hair is, like, stickin' out like this and she's bawlin'...
and Daddy sees it on the 10: 00 newscast.
cause he was in the hospital with Mama.
she was havin' her tubes tied after Johnny was born.
thank you.
didn't need to know that. - Well.
daddy sees Wanda gettin' arrested on TV for shoplifting.
he has a major coronary occlusion.
he just climbed up into the hospital bed with Mama...
then he pulled the sheet up over his own face...
and when the nurse came in, he was dead.
that was it. You know?
he left a note, 'cause Wanda got released from jail just for the funeral.
he said, "Wanda, you broke my heart. Signed, Daddy."
she did thirty days for one glazed doughnut.
a 59-cent doughnut. If it had been rock and roll...
she could have thrown sofas out of the window...
hotel window. No, not even her own sofa.
she could throw somebody else's sofa out the window.
you don't know what kind of passersby at the bottom.
she could have been hittin' people. It wouldn't have mattered.
but when you're playin' to Christian family audiences like we were...
you so much as forget to pay for a damn doughnut...
they throw you out like a piece of garbage.
sooner kill you than look at you.
some of those good people, eh?
the Soderberg family selling out!
I just do not get it.
I mean, they've owned WLT...
since they ran it out of a sandwich shop.
I mean, that's what the call letters stand for, you know.
"with Lettuce and Tomato." Did you know that?
I mean, how do you just walk away from somethin' like that?
I mean, what are we? Used Kleenex?
they got old, babe.
they started thinking about ease and comfort.
then, I figure, they saw a brochure about an island with palm trees...
and an azure sky and miles of sand...
and they thought, "Hey! Ha ha!"
we don't have to suffer through these miserable Minnesota winters.
we don't have to freeze our butts off waiting for our bus to come.
our bus has come. It's here. We'll leave the business to the kids...
and we'll head for paradise and to hell with it.
only trouble is...
the kids had already gone down to paradise ahead of them.
so then, a big corporation down in Texas...
offered them a gazillion dollars for it.
Texans.
sure.
they talk funny and their eyes don't focus...
and their flesh is rotting and falling off...
but hey. You know. So what?
Yeah, nobody's perfect and, uh... money is money...
so, the Soderbergs took the dough. End of story.
do you have any tweezers?
egg salad or ham salad?
why are you crying?
well, it's the last show.
I'm never going to see these people again.
you'll see them again.
I knew all of them from the old days.
soupy and Red, Ray.
and Helen.
gone and forgotten.
every sparrow is remembered.
I don't even know if they're gonna make a speech or anything.
it doesn't seem right, does it?
no.
some big company come in and steps on us...
like we were bugs at the picnic.
what's in ham salad?
l... I can't remember the word. It was...
may I...
maybe...
Mayo?
mayonnaise.
mayonnaise.
well, it's an end of an era when this show goes, guys.
there won't be anything left on the radio except what?
people yellin' at you and computers playing music.
I mean, it's a tragedy.
I wasn't gonna tell you this...
but between you and me and the fly on the wall...
there's a woman on the premises who I think, maybe, is gonna save our bacon.
she's got that look about her.
who is she?
I'm not sure. I'm still working on figuring that one out.
just close your eyes for a second.
she from NorComm?
time will tell.
I'll just let personal charm and dashing good looks do their work.
she walked in, couldn't take her eyes off me.
drawn to me like a moth to the flame.
every time there's a triumph in the world...
a million souls have to be trampled on.
and right there... you can see it right in the damn carpet.
what does that have to do with anything?
mama. She l... she went...
she went up to the...
it was a lot for Mama to put up with.
we had to shovel her into the Good Shepherd Home.
that's it. That was the sad day.
Connie quit the act.
God, we'd already lost Wanda.
Wanda was like magic.
the four of us, when we were together...
she was singin'. - She was...
and next to you, I'm tellin' you...
you've followed in her footsteps.
you are the same... the same talent.
no. I don't know about that.
so, now, it's just the two of us.
Yep. Just the two of us.
you know what? It was your dad got us on the radio.
God, that was a good-Iookin' family!
I can understand you goin' for that guy.
Yeah, he sang like an angel.
he sang...
~ Softly and tenderly ~
~ Jesus is calling ~
~ Callin' for you and for me ~
~ See on the portal ~
~ He's waiting and watching ~
~ Watching for you and for me ~
~ Come home ~
~ Come home ~
~ Ye who are weary, come home ~
singing is the only thing that puts me right.
~ Well, Charlie, you're a good ol' boy ~
~ Charlie, you're all right ~
~ Charlie, open up the store ~
~ We're comin' down tonight ~
~ Out where you can see the stars ~
~ And the living's slow ~
~ We'll eat potluck and pool guitars ~
~ Down on Old Plank Road ~
~ Ohh ~
~ Down on Old Plank Road ~
~ We'll eat potluck and pool guitars ~
~ Down on Old Plank Road ~
~ Come home ~
~ Come home ~
~ Ye who are weary, come home ~
hold it. Are we on?
uh, not yet. You've got a few minutes.
what are we doin'?
you're on in the Powdermilk segment doing Gold Watch and Chain with him.
we haven't done that for years.
~ I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love ~
~ I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring... ~
excuse me.
I gotta get a head start on gettin' pie-eyed tonight.
~ This heart in my bosom ~
~ Only say that you'll love me again ~
how about Red River Valley?
fine. Whatever you'd like.
I would just like there to be a spot for Lola on the show later.
I hope so. If there's time.
well, this isn't really gonna be your last show, is it?
every show's your last show.
that's my philosophy.
thank you, Plato. Kierkegaard.
button up, would ya?
I am. That's as far as it goes.
~ Well, sister and her oldest girl ~
~ They sing so good together ~
~ Jason, he can make me laugh ~
~ And he just keeps gettin' better ~
~ Claire has got a sweet new one ~
~ About her, Timmy-o ~
~ And John is everybody's man ~
~ Down on Old Plank Road ~
~ Ohh ~
~ Down on Old Plank Road ~
Hey, uh... can you tell potato face here that his butt is too big for his pants...
and people can see his crack...
and it ain't nothin' any normal person would ever care to look at?
where?
in the back. That's where your crack is.
well, I don't see nothin'.
Hey, Molly. - Don't talk to me.
am I decent back there?
don't ask me. I'm not your mother.
you might be decent if you lost 25 pounds of ugly fat.
and I might suggest cuttin' off your head.
she showed me her tattoo once.
hell she did.
on her shoulder.
you're lyin' through your teeth.
left shoulder. Right here.
that ain't the shoulder. - Whatever you want to call it.
I'd call it the clavicle.
OK, well, why don't you ask her about it?
maybe she'll let you have a look.
well, what did it say?
it said, "Freedom."
fr... Now I know you're lyin'.
come on. We gotta put out the CDs.
come on, niece.
Hey. Molly.
Molly, here. Take these out front.
did you hear about the Soderbergs sellin' the radio station?
I heard all about it.
are you OK?
Yes, of course. Hmm?
kind of a bizarre feeling, isn't it?
what? - The silence.
what?
you're gonna say somethin' about it.
you're gonna talk to the people, aren't you?
say, "Thanks for listening," or something.
Yeah, you know.
I don't think so.
why not? Say, "Thank you."
what?
I'm just not into making big speeches.
what do you do when you leave somebody's house?
you don't just turn around...
I don't make a big speech. A big weepy speech.
Oh, that's it! You're afraid that you're gonna cry!
I wouldn't.
Yeah, that's right. That's true. You wouldn't.
and you know, that's why, I think, that our romance was so short.
because I knew that when we broke up, you would not cry...
so, I got way over it.
does that make sense to you?
no, not at all.

wouldn't this be a good time for a piece of rhubarb pie?
~ Yes, one little thing can revive a guy ~
~ And that is a piece of rhubarb pie ~
~ Serve it up, nice and hot ~
~ Maybe things aren't as bad as you thought ~
~ Mammy's little baby loves rhubarb, rhubarb ~

Yes, Bebopareebop Rhubarb Pie.
and now, for Bebopareebop...
please welcome one of radio's great singing families...
the Johnson Girls, Rhonda and Yolanda.
Hi, everybody. - Hi.
Oh, thank you. Thank you! Thank you very much.
I just want to say right away how happy I am...
that my daughter Lola is here tonight.
come on, Lola. - Oh! Thank you, sweetheart.
they want to see you.
it means a lot to me that you came.
Yeah, I named my little girl Lola after our own mother.
Yeah, Lola was our mom.
Lola. And tonight, we're gonna sing...
an old song that our mother loved.
Oh, it's one of her favorites.
Yep. She was our inspiration.
some of you know this story...
but she's the main reason that we started makin' music originally...
because you know she...
it was the only way we knew to make her happy.
she'd be down on the kitchen floor scrubbin' on her knees.
but if you stood in the doorway and you sang a song that she liked...
why, she would just look up and smile.
ha ha! Worn out as she was...
it was a smile as wide as the Mississippi. Heh heh.
down at the mouth.
not so slow, you sons of bitches. I'll break your necks.
Yeah. - I mean it.
and you could see her gold tooth.
~ Way down upon that old Mississippi River ~
~ Not so far away ~
~ That's where my folks have lived forever ~
~ And that's where I'm going to stay ~
~ I been searchin' 'cross the whole creation ~
~ Half my life or more ~
~ And more ~
~ But I found my own sweet satisfaction ~
~ Right here on that muddy river shore ~
~ All the world is so sad and dreary ~
~ Everywhere I roam ~
~ Oh ~ - ~ Oh, Mama ~
~ Mama, how I miss the prairie ~
~ And my Minnesota home ~
I can see my mama's sweet, sweet face every Sunday morning.
all the good old hymns, praise God, that we've sung.
we knelt in prayer right beside our precious aunts and uncles...
~ Who loved us when we were young ~
~ In the valley of darkness ~
~ They are the shepherds ~
~ Who lead me to pastures green ~
~ And I'll sit with my mama ~
~ By the still, still waters ~
~ And goodness and mercy follow me ~
~ I floated down The Columbia and the Hudson ~
~ Walked on the banks of the Ohio ~
~ On the banks of the Wabash ~
~ And the mighty Colorado ~
~ And the old Red River way up north ~
~ All the world ~
~ It is a world of rivers ~
~ Flowing to the sea ~
~ But here on that old Mississippi ~
~ Here is the home for you and me ~
come on, bring it home!
~ All the world ~
~ It is so sad and dreary ~
~ Everywhere I roam ~
~ Oh, Mama ~
~ How I missed the prairie ~
~ And my Minnesota ~
~ Home ~
the Johnson Girls, thank you.
brought to you by Powdermilk Biscuits...
in the big blue box with the picture of the biscuit on the cover.
heavens, they're tasty.
and expeditious.
also brought to you by Mel's Big Boy Buffet.
why pay more for fancy food...
when what you really want is meatloaf, squash...
mashed potatoes, and bread pudding...
all at Mel's Big Boy Buffet for just 4. 99.
Yes, you heard me right.
$4. 99.
let's bring out Mr. Chuck Akers here...
Mr. Chuck Akers, come out here and give us a song.
the sweet singer of Kandiyohi County...
the heartthrob of mature women everywhere.
my good friend, Mr. Chuck Akers.
good to see you, sir.
thank you, sir.
uh, we would like to bring a song to all of our fans.
now, that's kind of tough to do, 'cause we're all over the place.
take me. Yeah, I've bounced all over.
I've done tent shows, schoolhouses, uh, parkin' lots...
the back of trucks, movie theaters, auditoriums.
I've even done churches.
now, that's hard to believe, I know.
anyway, this song is for you.
and we mean every word of it, all right?
SiC 'em.
~ My bark of life ~
~ Was tossin' down ~
~ The troubled stream of time ~
~ When first I saw ~
~ Your smilin' face ~
~ And youth was in its prime ~
~ Oh, I'll ne'er forget ~
~ Where'er I roam ~
~ Wherever you may be ~
~ If ever I ~
~ Have had a friend ~
~ You've been that friend to me ~
Hey, Lola. - Hi.
heard you're gonna sing a song for us, lookin' forward to that.
Oh, no. I don't... maybe.
well, it sure would mean the world to your mom.
she always said you had talent.
Yeah, I don't... I don't really know any of their songs.
I only know my own songs.
well, sing one of them then.
they're mostly about death.
well, lotta good songs about death.
all mine are about suicide.
Yeah, you know, um, hangin' yourself with an extension cord...
carbon monoxide, overdose... - Hey, ahem...
you know, we could do, uh, Amazing Grace together.
I know Amazing Grace.
yeah? Well, hey, look.
I'll play the guitar, we'll sing it together...
we'll bring this house down.
you know, I don't know if you knew this...
about my friend Dusty here... - Hey, hey.
but he learned to sing gospel music in San Quentin.
and full shush.
yes sir, that's where I met him.
I was with Johnny Cash, singin' in prisons.
shut the pie hole.
there were all these heinous, depraved criminals...
and well... - Liar, liar. Whatever, moron.
he sang Amazing Grace...
and it almost made you forget what he'd done.
which I don't wanna talk about.
you know, you are so dumb, you may be twins.
he made me promise on a Bible that I would never tell, and I won't.
so let that be the end of it. Let me just say this, though.
watch out for hugs.
right.
~ If ever I ~
~ Have had a friend ~
~ You've been that friend ~
~ To me ~ - ~ To me ~
~ If ever I ~
~ Have had a friend ~
~ You've been that friend to me ~
thank you. Thank you.
thank you, G. K.
Mr. Chuck Akers!
thank you, Chuck.
Robin and Linda Williams.
let's come in here now with a word about ketchup.
Yes, ketchup, made from tomatoes that contain natural sunshine...
which we need in this part of the country.
we are not a sunshiny people.
we're not a paradise people or a beach people.
we are dark people.
people who believed it could be worse.
and we're waiting for it to become worse.
we come from people who brought us up to believe that life is a struggle...
and if you should ever feel really happy...
be patient. This will pass.
ha ha ha. - So we could...
when do you guys go on?
as soon as ol' spud butt here shuts his yapper.
thanks for the encouragement.
Hey, you are gonna be great. Give me a hug.
all right, guys.
more show in just a moment...
but let's come in here now with a word about shoes!
that's Guy's Shoes. Boys...
~ Talkin' shoes ~
~ Talkin' Guy's ~
~ Any two, any size ~
~ From your ankles to your toes ~
~ At the bottom of your clothes ~
~ You're talkin' shoes ~
~ Talkin' Guy's ~
Yes, Guy's Shoes. They're made to last.
ask about those Guy's Cash Shoes, with the hole in the soles...
so you stash your cash when you're out on the trail.
isn't that right, Lefty?
that's where I keep mine, G. K.
all right. Let's welcome 'em now...
the old trail hands here...
the Pachelbels of the prairie, the Brahmses of the bunkhouse...
here they are, Dusty and Lefty.
good to have you with us. - Well, thank you, Garrison.
yes sir, it's good to be back on the show...
because, you know, it gets mighty Ionesome out there on the prairie.
and a cowboy gets tired of scenery after a while.
you get, well, sceneried out, and uh...
sort of wish you had somebody to talk to.
somebody smart.
so you're Ionesome for people, huh?
well, you know, it's true, Garrison.
and, uh, it-it ain't the same just talkin' to your horse.
my horse is extremely smart.
uh, he knows math.
he knows physics and chemistry...
but I can't seem to teach him philosophy.
can't teach him philosophy, eh?
well, no. You can't put Descartes before the horse.
that was a good one, you know?
well, what do you reckon we sing a song, Dusty?
well, let's do it, Lefty.
one, two, you know what to do.
~ I'm just an old cowboy ~
~ With twigs in my hair ~
~ Two-thirds alligator ~
~ And three-quarters bear ~
~ And one half a lion ~
~ But let it be known ~
~ I never told one lie ~
~ That was not my own ~
~ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo ~
~ Get along, little dogie ~
~ I eat when I'm hungry ~
~ I'll drink when I'm dry ~
~ Don't boss me or cross me ~
~ Or I'll spit in your eye ~
~ I think what I please ~
~ And I say what I mean ~
~ And I think all you women ~
~ Are the finest I've seen ~
~ Whoopi-ti-yi-yo... ~
so my mom said, um...
my mom said, you got into radio...
uh, when someone was flying a kite whose clothes came off? Ha.
a naked man flying. Quite a sight.
why didn't he pull his shorts up?
he was hanging on to the kite, couldn't let go.
he was up high. - Ha.
a hundred feet up in the air...
fifty.
so, how did that get you into radio?
well, that was how I met your dad.
here comes the solo.
Yeah, real good. Real good.
wait, naked guy... - Yeah?
was my dad? - Right.
naked man with red swim trunks around his ankles.
couple thousand people saw it...
so we figured it was a good time to leave town...
so we got a car, and we headed down to Chicago.
~ We ride in the snow ~
~ And we ride in the rain ~
~ Just like Gene Autry ~
~ Just like John Wayne ~
~ They were better cowboys ~
~ Than us and I mean it ~
~ But we are still livin' ~
~ And that is convenient ~
~ Pi-ti-yi-yo ~
~ Get along, little dogie ~
~ Pi-ti-yi-yo ~
~ Get along, little dogies ~
I go in to pay for the gas...
and he wakes up and decides he needs to use the men's room.
so I come back.
I think he's still sleeping in the back seat...
and I get behind the wheel, and I drive to Chicago.
I leave him there in Oshkosh.
and he goes into the cafe, and your mother was the waitress.
that's how they met.
that's how I came to be born.
well, it kind of led to that, yeah.
Yeah, but I mean if you had looked in the back seat...
and... and seen that he wasn't there, I wouldn't exist.
well, he and I weren't getting along that well, so that's why.
that's really strange.
well, no. I think it's one...
of the most beautiful things I ever did not do.
so how'd you get into radio then?
well, there was a show called, uh, The Baked Bean Jubilee.
Yeah, with my dad. - With your dad, right.
happy Baked Beans. - Happy Baked Beans, you know?
~ Happy Baked Beans ~
~ Are nutritious ~
Shh! Keep your voices down!
~ Made the natural way ~
keep your voices down! - ~ Made of natural fiber ~
~ Try some, you will say ~
there's a show going on! - ~ They are nature's fruit ~
~ Root-ti-toot-toot-toot ~
~ Try baked beans ~
~ Every day ~
let's come in here now with some cards and letters from the friends and neighbors out there.
so good to know that you're out there listening.
here's a little note here from Aaron...
who says our show is a source of comfort and laughter for him.
and he's hoping... - And he's hopin' that the Johnson Girls...
he's goin' to hear them shake their hips a little...
and sing Touch me, Kiss me, Be my man.
no, he was just joking, he says.
just joking about that.
he was hoping that we would sing, uh, Gold Watch and Chain.
Oh. Oh, I bet. - Yolanda.
Yolanda and I.
so let's bring up Yolanda here.
this beautiful old song Gold Watch and Chain. Boys.
~ Darlin', how can I stay here without you? ~
~ I have nothing to ease my poor heart ~
~ All the world would seem sad, dear, without you ~
~ Tell me now that we never will part ~
~ I will pawn you my gold watch and chain, love ~
~ I will pawn you my gold wedding ring ~
~ I will pawn you this... ~
Molly? - What?
would you come here a moment?
what is it, Guy?
um, I just want to...
Oh...
you are fat.
y-you might think about cutting down on the, um, desserts and the beer.
and also possibly sex with men.
w-when did... when did this take place?
who... who did this to you?
ahh, yes, Lefty, Dusty, are... are you boys aware of this?
O-OUR little girl's going to be a-a single mom.
you poor thing. - Thank you.
I'll swear on a stack of Bibles it wasn't me, darlin'.
Oh, that's great to know, Dusty. Thanks.
~ Do not scorn her ~
~ With words fierce and bitter ~
~ Do not laugh at her shame and downfall ~
you should sit.
~ For a moment, just stop and consider ~
just ignore them.
~ That a man was the cause of it all ~
dusty!
yo!
that reminds me.
about that obscene song you sang last week.
obscene? Uh... - Yeah.
"I'll give you my moonshine if you show me your jugs"?
no, not that one.
"Lovin' you ain't easy, but I hear your sister is?"
no, no, no. Come ride my pony all night long.
"come ride him bareback, I'll sing you a song." That one.
that's just a song about ridin' a pony.
Oh, what... what the hell did you think it was about?
let's go out with a little style, OK?
what do you say?
"go out"? What do you mean?
just what I said.
"go out?" You mean me?
all of us.
what the Sam Hill are you talkin' about, mister?
Ohh. Hold on. - Hey.
got some nice egg salad sandwiches if you're hungry.
no gunplay backstage.
I'm hungry. I'm always hungry.
did you know that she's pregnant?
~ And can't be returned ~
~ You have left me and gone to another ~
~ All my hopes and bridges are burned ~
~ But I will pawn you my gold watch and chain, love ~
~ And I will pawn you my gold wedding ring ~
~ I will pawn you this heart in my bosom ~
~ Only say that you'll love me again ~
~ Only say that you'll love me again ~
~ Only say that you'll love me again ~
thank you, Yolanda.
what a beautiful, beautiful song.
this portion of our show is brought to you...
by Powdermilk Biscuits...
and also brought to you by duct tape.
duct tape. Yes, duct tape.
duct tape.
useful thing around the household...
almost anything that comes up around the household.
sometimes you need to make repairs, doors come loose...
and windows, all sorts of things can happen.
sometimes you just forget something that you're looking for...
and duct tape can come in handy.
you can wrap it around your finger like a string or something.
you can just tape it up. Whatever.
things do tend to fall apart, you know.
my name is michael westen.
I used to be a spy until...
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing
no cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend... - should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the fbi...
you know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate.
someone needs your help, Michael.
bottom line -- until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere.
in the world of intelligence, if an operative hands you a crossword puzzle, chances are you've just received a coded message.
it's the art of steganography
sending coded messages that don't look like messages unless you have the key.
meet AT MARWA MALL NOON
Fiona: So, does this new handler of yours set all her meetings with crossword puzzles?
or is she just flirting with you?
Michael: These people burned me, blacklisted me, and threatened my family.
I think we're a little past flirting.
keep the engine running.
if you see her leave -- - tail her. I know.
we can't take more proactive measures?
there's room in the trunk.
the idea is to find out who she's working for without her knowing, fi.
it calls for something a little more subtle than throwing her in the trunk.
you ready, Sam? - All set.
listen, Mike, uh, I hate to bring this up, but is this gonna take a while?
cause I got a meeting of my own I got to get to.
Yeah, the pilates class with veronica. Fi told me.
look, it's a great way to strengthen your core, okay?
give me a break, will you?
I'm in the doghouse with veronica, and it's all your fault.
Yeah. She's still all over me about how the cadillac got all banged up.
I won't make you late, Sam.
just make sure you get a shot of Carla before you go.
in covert ops, you always want to be the one setting the meeting.
when you're following someone else's instructions, they set the agenda, they control the security, and they get to make you jump through hoops to remind you they are in charge.
Carla: Hello, Michael.
can I get you something to drink?
Carla THE NEW HANDLER
I'll have what you're having.
I don't think they serve qishr here.
Mmm, yemenese coffee.
I prefer to brew it myself.
drinks you get in restaurants, you never...
quite know what's in them, do you?
thank you for meeting me at the mall.
work has been so busy that I just don't get the time to shop.
well, we can't have that.
give me your boss's number. I'll give him a call.
cute.
it's a security badge -- integrated circuit processor, embedded hologram...
overlaminate patch -- makes it damn near impossible to duplicate.
Where'd you get it?
that's not your concern.
what you need to know is there's one counterfeiter in Miami who can forge it.
a Tunisian -- name's Nefzi.
you're gonna introduce us?
no, you're gonna make the approach on your own.
that's the way we do things, and that's why we like working with people like you.
we'd like the duplicate and the original back in two days.
then... what?
we're done with the burn notice? I get my life back?
it's not that simple, Michael -- not by a long shot.
but playing nice has its rewards.
you can keep whatever you don't give to Nefzi.
looking for Sam?
you know, Michael, I brought friends, too.
what did you do?
Oh, don't worry. They're fine.
next time, the kids stay home.
Carla's guys were good. I never saw them coming.
they way they covered their approach -- it was impressive.
a polite bunch, too, for countersurveillance types.
not with this.
Sam still pouting?
it was veronica'S.
what's the security badge for?
I don't know.
figure that out, we might be able to answer a few questions.
I got to find a Tunisian counterfeiter.
what about Barry? He's a weasel.
but he launders money for half of Miami.
he can probably put you in touch.
Yeah, Barry didn't enjoy our last meeting.
he's dodging me.
avoiding Sam's calls, too.
Nope. Gonna need a fresh face...
someone he won't expect.
you know how I feel about money launderers.
the last one I dealt with -- they're still finding pieces of him all over belfast.
do it for me?
your charms no longer have any effect on me, Michael.
do it for all the yogurt you can eat?
fine.
but I can't promise that I won't kill him.
Yeah, Sam?
Hey, Mike. I'm, uh, headed to the Carlito.
um, look, there's a thing I need to talk to you about right away.
I hope he will come. - Aw, he'll be here. He'll be here.
we'll just grab a seat. Hey, Mike.
hold up. Mike.
is this a job, Sam? It's not a good time for a job.
look, I know you got this whole counterfeiting thing.
but just hear her out. She's a real sweetheart. She's got a problem with a stalker.
stalker? - Yeah.
you were a navy seal. You can't handle this?
Yeah, well, look, normally I'd handle it with a few stern words and a baseball bat, but this is kind of A...
kind of a delicate situation.
Plus, she asked me in front of Veronica.
so?
when I'm on a job, it turns her on.
it's all I can do to keep up.
the things this woman does -- - got it.
I'm trying to get some, too -- - I got it -- got it. I got it.
his name is Raul.
I met him at the restaurant where I'm a hostess.
he calls me all the time.
Sophia THE CLIENT
I say I'm not interested, but...
he thinks I am teasing.
the guy won't take "hit the road, Raul" for an answer.
he pays all the bartenders at the restaurant to tell him who I talk to.
and every day he just comes...
he comes and watches me.
have you gone to the police? - Yes.
they say they cannot do anything unless he hurts me.
but he gets so angry.
every day it gets worse.
I don't want to wait until something terrible happens.
it's gonna be fine. Like I told you, Mike is the best in the business.
I'll see what I can do.
what time does Raul usually show up at the restaurant?
at the restaurant? Ay, no.
por dios, you can'T.
Raul -- he's a very big customer.
if you make a problem there, I will lose my job.
okay, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
we can meet him somewhere else. Just tell us where to find him.
I go to church every day.
Raul always wants to pick me up.
how did you and Sophia meet, exactly?
Oh, we're in the same cooking class.
Oh, Veronica set it up.
you know, it was one of those things where they get a famous chef in, and they crack open a couple eggs and a bottle of wine.
not exactly the kind of thing that a hostess making minimum wage signs up for.
don't know. She wants to be a chef. Must have saved up.
Yeah, ma?
Michael, you still haven't fixed my coffee maker, and I can't find the warranty.
warranty? That thing was built in 1967.
well, I need it for my poker game. Can you come over later?
there he is, Mike.
Hello? - Yeah, I'll be there. See you later, ma.
Raul THE STALHER
that stalker happens to have a mac-10 in his jacket.
Oh, you knew, didn't you?
Mike, look, I did a little pre-scouting, but I -- I knew he was packing.
I didn't know he had a mac-10. I thought it was like a regular gun.
look, I'm in a jam, and this girl Sophia -- she's in real trouble.
Yeah. - I just need a little help.
we're gonna have to do recon.
you're buying lunch.
okay, you got it, Mikey.
I'm starving, anyway.
need a refill here, hon.
Barry THE MONEY LAUNDERER
Oh, my god.
hard man to find.
just tell mike it's not personal, okay?
last time I saw him, there was this kind of, you know, "do this for me or we're enemies for life" vibe.
it scared me a little.
Barry, he just needs some information. - All right.
we're looking for a tunisian counterfeiter. You know any?
Tunisian? Where is Tunisia, even?
is that next to Spain or something? Listen, I got to be out of here.
I got a rubdown in, like, 10 minutes.
all right, all right. I got it.
you're talking about Nefzi.
you don't want to deal with him. Trust me.
he's the go-to guy for all the hardcore stuff
fake money for coke deals, counterfeit passkeys for bank robberies
stuff that gets people killed.
Plus, he's the most arrogant son of a bitch in south Florida.
where can we find him?
he operates out of a tv-repair store down in south Mmiami.
word is, Nefzi was part of the security force for the Tunisians back in the early '80s.
nasty. If he brings out the electrodes, I'd leave.
you see, that wasn't so hard, was it, Barry?
we're done here? Okay.
cause if you want, I can arrange a massage for you or something.
dinner after?
who needs electrodes when you have one of these?
Hey, I was just asking.
you know, they stopped making parts for this when Nnixon was president.
I'm gonna get you a new one.
you know, Michael...
I've started seeing a counselor.
and she said that there are unresolved issues between you and me.
Really?
and she'd like you to come to the sessions.
counseling with you?
Yeah, uh, now's not a really good time 'cause I have a lot on my plate.
I'm just gonna throw this out.
you know, I've been waking up with night sweats ever since you sent me to fort lauderdale because of those men with guns who were chasing you, Michael.
fine. I will go with you.
I knew you'd think it was a good idea.
so I made our first appointment for tomorrow.
I'm gonna take this.
Mike, I tailed Raul to his job.
man, you got to see this.
more guns. Great. - Yeah.
looks like Raul's in charge of this operation.
yeah? Hey, dumpling.
Oh, just taking care of that thing for Sophia.
well, Sammy will take whatever reward you want to give him, baby.
uh, pumpkin, let me call you back.
we need a better look, see who we're dealing with.
you think you can handle that, pumpkin?
Yeah. I got it, Mike.
wait, wait, wait a second. Let -- let me see if I hear that right.
he says I'm uninsurable?
well, that's a pretty big word for a guy who can't read without moving his lips.
Relex, I'll handle this.
here's what we do, then.
you tell Jerry Jerry's not moving my cargo anymore, okay?
Yeah, you tell him that. My god.
Hey, uh, you El Jefe?
you ship stuff? 'Cause I got stuff to ship.
I'm talking pilates equipment -- a lot of it.
you know, it's those things that are in gyms. They're like big beach balls.
all of a sudden, every joker in tampa's got to have them.
so I need to make this happen like, you know, yesterday?
you have the wrong place.
well, hear me out. I mean, these are your trucks, right?
I'm just -- I'm just looking to rent a little extra space.
you know, uh, off the books, frankly.
sorry. All of our spaces are taken.
Oh, I get it. Okay, I'll play your game.
how much you want -- like, 5 bucks a cub
leave...Now.
we'll just consider that a down payment for the future.
okay, thanks a lot. You have a good one, now. Take care.
okay, big opportunity right out the window there.
see you, guys. Have a good one.
who are you? - Who am I? What do you mean?
we stopped by Raul's work.
he's loading trucks full of lidocaine and coffee cans.
I don't know. I don't underst
lidocaine is used to cut cocaine, and coffee masks the smell from the dogs.
dios mio. Drugs?
drugs. Shocking.
you never saw anything, huh?
now, it never occurred to you that most trucking executives don't drive in porsches and carry mac-10s?
please don't hurt me.
you approached Sam at a cooking class which costs more than you earn all week.
and then you happen to mention a sad story about Raul?
what a coincidence -- Sam can help.
I'm telling you the truth.
who are you?
I'm D. E.A. I'm a cop.
I've been undercover for two years, making a case against Raul's boss, Campos.
he runs a billion dollars in cocaine through Miami for the valdez cartel.
and Raul is his number-two guy in charge of security.
okay, look.
is Raul really stalking you, or was that a lie, too?
no, it's the truth.
the hostess job at Ernesto's is my cover.
that's where Campos likes to eat and talk business.
I tried not to draw attention to myself, but Raul noticed me.
and if you went to the D. E.A. With your problem, they'd pull you off the job.
Yeah, my investigation would be over.
I've worked too hard to let that happen, and that's why I came to you.
nice touch, approaching me through Sam.
well, I'm sorry I lied.
but I needed to be sure you'd help me.
you'd do the same thing. I've heard the stories.
what stories?
there are rumors about a guy who took on the cartel a while back.
I found the people you helped, and they told me what you did.
don't believe everything you hear.
listen, I don't care who you were. I just need help.
they have a big shipment coming in a few days.
I'm really close to finding out where.
but not if Raul kills you first.
I could go to jail for involving you.
I'm out here alone. Do you understand?
Yeah, actually.
I have a pretty good idea what that's like.
Ernesto's -- that's where I work.
there's Campos.
he and Raul meet every day for lunch.
Campos THE BOSS
is that kind of firepower normal, or is this a special occasion?
Campos is in a turf war with the mexicans.
they put a hit out on him last week. It's pretty ugly.
Ugly's good. We can work with ugly.
how?
I need to get in with Raul quietly, make myself useful, get some information.
then I let Campos know that Raul is spilling information to a new friend behind his back.
Campos deals with Raul for us, and it looks like you had nothing to do with it.
you make it sound so easy.
that sounded easy?
Raul? - Where the hell are you?
on the bus, coming to work.
I called you. Left you messages.
you didn't answer or call back...
who are you with?
I'm not with anyone, Rual.
if you are lying
I swear. There's no one here.
we'll talk about it when I see you.
you don't have to do this.
I know.
Sam told me about your latest client.
she sounds like a handful.
just helping her with a job.
where did all these checks come from?
Barry. Whatever you said to him must have been convincing.
these are leftovers from a defunct shell company.
what are you doing with them?
becoming a forger.
approach the Tunisian with a few phony checks...
and you're not just a client, you're a colleague.
check fraud is more about technique than high-tech equipment.
some old checks, a roll of scotch tape, some nail-polish remover, and you're in business.
nail-polish remover is mostly acetone, which dissolves ink.
get your hands on a check that's been filled out by the account holder, dissolve everything but the signature, and you've got yourself a blank check.
counterfeiters call it "check washing."
there may be no honor among thieves, but there's a certain amount of respect.
establishing you're in the same racket is a great way to make an introduction.
Nefzi, right?
how did you find me?
Nefzi THE COUNTERFEITER
Barry referred you?
Ah, manner of speaking.
he called you a son of a bitch, which, I figured, anybody Barry doesn't like, cool by me.
anyway, I took this job. I got to dupe this.
little out of my league.
I'm good with papers, not with computers.
I think this is a computer thing, right?
Yes, it's a computer thing.
why would anyone believe you could do this?
did I mention I'm good with papers?
check fraud is for children.
counterfeiting electronics takes real skill.
no argument from me. That's why I'm coming to you.
I can do this job, but, uh, it'll cost you.
Yeah, I figured. Maybe we could do a whatchamacallit -- like the barter?
you know? I give you some of my work, and you do the badge for me.
this is hackwork I can do in my sleep.
cash only -- $10, 000.
$5, 000 now, $5, 000 on delivery.
okay.
people who try to cheat me...
they regret it. You understand me?
I wouldn't dream of it.
when can I get the badge back?
I can have a basic knockoff by tomorrow, but if you want a better quality, it'll take a few days.
take your time.
Yeah, mom?
Michael, I'm at the counselor's office.
you missed our appointment.
Oh, um, some-- something came up. I should have called.
Yeah, well, they have a very strict cancellation policy here, Michael.
it's worse than the airlines.
I'll pay for the session.
that's not the point.
Hello?
Carla: You look upset.
is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
just some personal issues.
thanks for asking.
if you need to talk, Michael, I'm here for you.
I appreciate that.
why don't you give me your home number, and I'll take you up on that?
I assume we'll be getting our badges soon. - A few days.
that wasn't what was agreed to.
we were expecting them sooner.
Yeah, well, that's the best I can do.
I doubt that, Michael.
Yeah, the man I'm looking for.
and why is that?
you're in -- let's call it the shipping business, and me, let's call me a consultant.
now, a guy moving your kind of cargo is always looking to make it go from point "a" to point "B.
I can help with this job.
I can make your life easier...
a lot easier for the right price.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I import coffee.
right, and I used to work for the Mexicans. Let's cut the crap.
you know, where I come from, talk like that...
can get you killed.
well, I'm sure you wouldn't want blood all over that nice suit, so why don't you just hear me out?
talk.
I busted my ass for the Mexicans.
they didn't truly appreciate what I do.
and what is it exactly that you do?
I expedite things.
I got a lot of friends.
who are these friends?
police, customs, on the docks.
anything beyond that, I'd be giving away my trade secrets.
but I can assure you that your deliveries would come on time, hassle-free.
how does that sound? - Too good to be true.
strange that you come to me, not to my boss.
what do I want with your boss?
you'll be my boss. I don't even want to meet Campos.
I mean, the way I see it, I'm just here to make you look good, me to make money.
as long as I'm paid, you can be the hero.
you know, if you're interested, give me a call.
sit. Allow me to buy you a drink, no?
s?
my girlfriend.
Raul, I have to work.
Yes, yes my love.
we need a table for two and a bottle of Dom.
very nice girl, huh?
Catholic.
a volcano waiting to erupt.
she loves me more than her own life.
that's a lot.
mom?
I wanted to apologize for, you know, missing our appointment.
Michael, the new coffee maker.
thank you.
that's more than enough apology.
why didn't you wake me last night?
I was in a hurry.
Madeline: Uh, excuse me.
you were here long enough to read the paper.
did your mom like the coffee maker?
I picked it out myself.
built-in grinder, integrated water filter.
makes up to 10 cups.
perfect for her weekly poker game.
Yeah, I'd stay away from her.
you were the one that told me I needed to buy her a coffee maker.
what about these? Do you like these?
it depends on where you're staying.
they're nice for south beach, but if you're in coral gables, I'd go with something conservative.
always pushing. Always probing.
it's cute.
but you need to understand something.
right now, you work for us.
and who would that be?
there's an easy way to do this and a hard way.
I like my way.
is that why you decided to take your time delivering the badges
to see how I would respond?
quality work takes time. - Right, right.
every puppy starts off chewing the furniture, Michael.
eventually they learn.
next time I give you a deadline, I expect you to meet it.
don't test me again, or the next time I leave a gift at your mom's house, it's not gonna be a coffee maker.
if you want to make a friend, solve a problem for them.
no problem to solve? Create one.
almost done, Michael.
make it look professional.
Yeah, I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
you getting friendly with Raul?
Yeah, friendly enough. If I know my drug cartels, it won't take much longer to make it look like he's going behind the boss' back.
got to go.
he's searching your car.
relationships are about trust.
people trust you when they have something on you
like, say, the name and address of a mistress in orlando or information about a secret gambling habit.
it's all about making them feel secure.
money problems? - That's my business.
relax.
if things go well, everything's okay.
if it doesn'T...
we know where your friends and your family are
a little insurance in case you get scared and run to the police.
fine.
maybe now you'll give me a route and shipping information so I can do my job.
that is not how it works.
then how the hell am I supposed to help you with the Mexicans and the police if you keep me in the dark?
you tell me what you know first.
man, this is a waste of my time.
no. You sit.
people don't trust information they get for free.
if you want to sell someone on a lie, you have to make them drag it out of you.
it's effective, but often painful.
you said you can be useful, no? Fine. You tell me something.
it checks out, we talk. If not...
all right.
the D. E.A.
they got a gps tracking device on one of your trucks.
I got a source in the D. A.'S office.
how could you be so stupid?
I've always liked to think that the "c" in counseling stands for communication.
it sounds like what Madeline needs is for you to share something from that part of your life that's been closed off.
nothing's coming to mind.
you're missing the point.
you're right, ma. I am.
let's try it this way.
Madeline, um, you mentioned there were times when you wanted more communication but didn't get it.
can you share an example with Michael?
every year, Michael called me on my birthday.
about eight years ago, he forgot.
I was very upset, and I never understood why he didn't communicate.
Michael, would you like to respond?
at the time, I was stationed overseas, transporting a colleague to a locked facility.
there were some individuals who were trying very hard to prevent me from doing my job.
I was injured and in a field hospital for six weeks.
they didn't have a phone, so I could not communicate.
excellent.
now it's your turn, Michael.
my turn?
when I was 9, I stole groceries because dad blew his paycheck.
go on.
the owner's son, Tommy Knox, the bag boy, caught me while I was running out
pounded me pretty good, gave me a black eye.
but I got away with the groceries.
when I got home, you took the groceries, mom, but you never asked me about the black eye.
any communication about that?
boys fight, Michael.
I thought you'd bought the groceries.
then why did we never go back to that store?
let's talk about the time that we went to Disney world.
so, what made you pick her?
there was something about her I liked.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Really? I didn't think it was so bad.
yeah? - It's Raul.
I've been thinking about your proposal.
meet me at the restaurant.
Raul, what's going on?
what's going on?
well, that is what I would like to know.
what are you talking about? What is this?
a friend of mine used to be in the secret service in Venezuela.
he knows how to find things, like phone records.
I had him look in Sophia's cellphone.
you two were talking, no?
did you think that I would not find out?
I don't know what she's told you.
she did not tell me nothing.
I had to figure it out for myself.
now I will ask you the same thing I asked her.
how long have you and this puta been sleeping together?
you are out of your mind, Raul.
do you think that I am stupid?
no. I don't think you're stupid, Raul. I know you are.
inexperienced operatives abandon a cover I. D.Under pressure.
experienced ones just play their roles harder.
stop wasting my time!
of course I talked to Sophia!
I'm checking up on you!
you don't think I do my homework on the people I'm doing business with?
I'm a professional!
please, Raul.
I wish that I could trust you.
nothing happened.
you know, she's right. Nothing.
she wouldn't give you up.
I tried to give her money. She wouldn't take it.
but if you want to shoot her, go ahead.
in fact, I'll do it myself. - No.
you did that for me?
why didn't you tell me?
I was scared.
you have nothing to be afraid of.
we're going somewhere nice tonight.
can we talk now?
we done playing games?
no.
it is time for you to meet the boss.
Yeah. Remember we said no bosses?
that's not how I operate.
I don't care. That is how I operate.
Mike, that's gonna screw up the whole plan.
I thought the idea here was to make Raul seem like a traitor.
well, how you gonna catch him selling secrets behind his boss's back when he's standing right in front of the guy, introducing you?
if we can't make raul a traitor one way, we're gonna have to do it another way.
Fi, get me a sniper rifle and some c-4.
Ooh, I like where this is going.
I just opened that.
we have work to do.
morning, fellas! How you doing?
I'm back. Good to see you.
most people think distracting a group of guys is best done by a beautiful woman.
the problem with beautiful women is people want them to stick around, which can cause a lot of problems.
ever seen one of these?
I got plenty more ready to go. Look.
I got to talk to your supervisor again.
tell him I'm offering some real money, okay? Mucho
obnoxious guys they just want to get rid of.
dinero -- see, that was a good upper-body workout.
you know, you're just, uh, uh -- you truly are bullies. Okay, okay, okay. Got it.
Raul says you may be able to help us.
he told me about the gps device. What else do you know?
I know your operation has problems -- vulnerabilities.
vulnerabilities?
you have problems with your perimeter out there.
I know how the feds are getting to your trucks.
show me.
you see those boats? They're an easy access point.
you ready, Sam? Go.
I'm not talking about fencing. I'm talking about a wall
you know, blocking the view from the street.
I'm in a meeting, Sophia.
I'm sorry. I don't want to bother you...but I need your help.
what's wrong?
there's a man here...
he's drunk and keeps putting his hands all over me.
Hey, come on over here, mamacita. Come over here and meet chuck.
give it up. Give me some.
stay right there.
I have to go.
I need to handle something with Sophia at the restaurant.
I'm sorry.
you don't think Raul would ever -- nah.
what? - I don't know.
Raul would never go to the cops.
of course not. - No. I know.
it's just that Sophia's not at work today.
so why is he going to the restaurant to meet her?
most assassinations involve the firing of a single well-placed bullet.
get down!
the trick to selling an assassination attempt is to use a lot more firepower.
and an explosion or two doesn't hurt.
Raul set you up!
find Raul!
bring him to me !
drug cartels have their own internal justice system.
it doesn't involve courts or lawyers or proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
if they think you might be a traitor, they'll kill you just to be on the safe side.
run, Raul! Run, baby!
and we fit a half a kilo of cocaine in every can.
look, I'm not talking anymore, okay? Not until I'm
I'm sure that you can protect me from Campos.
don't worry. You cooperate, we'll take care of you.
just got to make sure you're telling us everything.
so we're gonna have you talk to one of our agents
someone who knows your operation pretty well.
Hello, Raul.
how'd it go?
Raul took a plea.
he's headed to a maximum-security facility for his own protection.
with what he gave us, Campos will be going away for a long time, too.
I can't thank you enough.
if there's anything -- - there is.
the rumor you heard about me -- keep it a rumor.
don't worry.
can't even tell the difference.
of course you can'T.
it took three prototypes, but that one's my masterpiece.
now... the rest of the money. - Yeah.
Hey, any way of telling what these things are for?
of course there are ways.
there's an extra 5 grand in the bag if you could tell me.
you know, I got a guy who wants to know what buildings these get you into.
I can find out.
come back next week.
in intelligence, a good adversary lets you think you're winning.
they know the best attack is the one you don't see coming.
so you learn to be vigilant when you think you've got the upper hand...
because that's when they'll strike.
if you walk in on a corpse and can't catch your breath, you might be suffering from a panic attack, or someone might be pumping nitrogen gas into the room to displace all the oxygen.
it's not a bad way to kill someone.
they suffocate before they realize there's a problem.
it won't show up on a tox screen, and there's no trail left behind...
unless you know where to look.
there are a lot of disadvantages to being at the scene of a crime.
you can get arrested.
you can get yourself killed.
and no matter how many times you've done it, it's never fun hanging out with a dead body.
but the advantage is there's no one around to object to a little intelligence gathering.
mom?
Hi, honey. Want some coffee? I made a pot.
no, uh, we got to go. Don't we have the session?
I decided to find another counselor -- someone who has better questions.
mom, what I did while I was away I don't like to talk about.
but if you want to spend time together, we can do that.
we can take a pottery class together.
no, thanks.
that's all I need is another ugly ceramic ashtray.
I remember when you came home with the groceries.
you said you bought them.
and you looked so proud...
that it broke my heart.
I thought that you didn't want me to know, Michael.
I always hated that bag boy.
it's nice to know I was right about him.
he was awfully good, don't you think?
are you gonna kill everyone I talk to?
better them than you, Michael.
no more nitrogen gas, no more high-powered rifles.
all right, fine.
Oh, look. You forgot your money.
no, I'm never gonna work for you, Carla. Not that way.
that's okay, Michael.
I'll hold on to it for you.
no coffee today?
sorry, I have another meeting...
but we'll be in touch.
Sam: Hey, Mike. What's up?
Yeah, Sam. I think I got something.
Carla speaks Arabic with a Kurdish accent.
you think she was stationed there?
I was hoping you could ask around.
will do, buddy. But I got to tell you, it's not much to go on.
I know, Sam. But it's more than we had.
they cylons were created by man
they rebelled
they evolved
there are many copies
and they have a plan
but the star in the system is highly unstable.
if you can believe it on the verge of going supernova.
we just picked up four base ships inbound at high speed.
it's just a matter of time until the cylons find out what we're up to on this planet.
Starbuck has gone down!
I am going after my wife!
I can't let you do that, sam. -I am not asking you for permission.
sergeant mathias.
what if I told you that your daughter was still alive?
I'd say you were lying.
she's on our base ship right now.
she's ill, and we don't know why.
I mean, I don't even know how I found this place.
I just got this urge to start walking, and then suddenly here it is.
the scriptures say this temple is the final resting place of the eye of jupiter.
what exactly are we talking about?
it's a marker that was left behind by the 13th tribe.
it's supposed to point the way to earth.
we want the eye of jupiter.
make any attempt to attack this ship or the people on the planet's surface,
I'll launch every nuke I've got.
major, you've got to hold off the cylons until chief finds the eye of jupiter.
if it looks like they're gonna get into the temple your order is to blow it.
we have to go down to the planet.
I am so close to seeing the faces of the last five cylons.
the final five revealed only to those who enter the temple.
only to the chosen one.
the chosen one.
we just picked up six heavy raiders heading down toward the planet.
order nuclear ground-strike missiles I'm not gonna let the cylons get their hands on the eye.
are we prepared to sacrifice lee?
missiles are loaded, admiral.
release of nuclear weapons is now authorized.
Mr. Gaeta...
disable, launch, and warhead safeties on tubes 4 through 10.
safeties disabled.
warheads are armed.
X. O...
please input your firing code.
these nukes will obliterate anything or anyone within 20 klicks of the temple.
I know.
he's gonna do it. Recall the raiders immediately.
we agree.
bring them back.
we agree. After all this time we can't afford to lose everything.
we agree.
bring them back.
algae PLANET BASE CAMP
if kara dies out there...
I swear to gods, I will kill you myself.
if she dies out there, I'll let you.
so what are we gonna do now follow me around with a gun?
because that is the only way that I am not going after kara.
private sykes.
sir?
get lieutenant dualla on the line.
Yes. sir
I'm here.
do you have eyeballs on starbuck's position?
negative, we have no visual on her raptor but I can see smoke from the crash site.
she went down behind a hill a couple klicks away.
can you get to the raptor?
I don't know. It's pretty far away There's minimal cover.
is it doable?
I don't know.
key.
standing by.
launch sequence set to auto.
they want the key to finding earth as much as we do.
he won't just destroy it.
we spoke, and the decision's been made.
fire on my mark.
sir, the raiders are turning back.
not all of them. -Uh, correction.
five have turned back.
one is still en route back to the planet.
what are you doing?
he won't launch against just one ship.
he won'T -That's not the issue.
we made a decision.
d'anna has to turn back.
no, call d'anna and baltar.
na, turn them around now.
what do you mean, "no"?
this is something that we have to do.
he won't launch over one ship. You'll see.
you want me...
you want me to rescue captain thrace?
attempt the rescue.
Yes, sir.
Foxfire one out.
we go.
weapons are still hot, admiral.
safe all missiles. Close down the doors.
there. You see?
never over just one ship.
that is not a good sign, my friends.
she defied us, defied the group.
it's not about in the eye of jupiter.
it's about her.
it's like we don't even know them anymore.
we may have to so something about this.
we may have to do it sooner than later.
Hera's alive.
I'm her mother, and I'm going to get her.
Sharon, baby, listen to me, okay?
we could take a raptor We can fly to the base ship ourselves.
I don't-- I don't care anymore.
we can'T.
we'll find another way.
we will.
there is no other way.
don't ask me to do this, sharon.
listen to me.
you have always been the strong one.
you believed in us when no one else would.
I'm begging you to do this.
find the courage to do this for both of us, okay?
I love you.
I love you too.
41401 SURVIVORS
wait outside. -Yes, sir
Sharon's downloading into another body aboard a cylon ship right now, isn't she?
she begged me.
she begged me to do it.
gods, if you'D...
seen the look in her eyes when I--...
she has important information on our defenses.
codes, procedures, the tactical situation down on the planet's surface.
the cylons have access to all of that as well.
she won't betray us.
you know that.
it's why you gave her the uniform.
she may not have a choice.
did you consider that?
she says she could resist that she wouldn't let it happen.
she'll get hera...
and she'll come back.
that's quite a leap of faith you've made, there, captain.
and if it involved your family only I'd say it was brave.
but you've put the entire fleet in jeopardy are you aware of that?
if you hadn't lied...
and stolen our baby in the first place...
we wouldn't be here at all.
I certainly played my part in bringing us to this moment.
and there's plenty of blame to throw around, and I accept it.
and now all of our lives are in the hands of sharon agathon.
all we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, captain.
and you as well, admiral.
can you tell me what happened?
they wouldn't let me see my daughter so my husband shot me.
it was the only way.
well, it's over now.
the important thing is that you're here.
how's my daughter?
she's getting worse.
I want to see her.
and then what?
what they did to me...
stealing my baby...
and telling me she was dead...
you proved it.
Hera's safer here...
and so am I.
all right, before she went down starbuck spotted about 15-plus chrome jobs advancing on us from here.
to get to us, the toasters have to come through this canyon.
this is a natural choke point.
that's where we'll ambush them...
guerilla style.
our mission is to hold the temple here.
if we fail, we blow it up.
we fall back to these rendezvous points.
and then we head into the mountains and we wait for rescue.
well, it's a good a place as any to die, I suppose.
what do you think?
well...
it was a nice day for a walk.
snipers!
Hey, take it easy, fischer.
Sarge?
Sarge?
Oh, gods!
Oh, it's just crazy.
come on, think, think.
Galen, it's major adama.
sir.
chief, we're in position.
any luck finding the eye of jupiter?
no, major. I need more time.
get on it.
the cylons are on the move We'll hold them off as long as we can.
Apollo out.
okay, people, listen up. xxxxx -It's so close. -I know.
the answers to all your questions are down there in that temple.
what's wrong?
I'm worried, gaius.
this is what we've been waiting for.
you are the anointed one.
chosen by god to look on the faces of the final five cylons.
it's already written.
you will succeed.
that's what I'm afraid of.
to know the face of god...
is to know madness.
the hybrid had looked into the space between life and death.
and she's seen things that we cannot conceive of.
but she's been driven mad as a result.
have faith in god.
put your life in his hands.
he will guide you to your destiny.
I'm grateful to you.
for everything.
her destiny will part company from yours, gaius.
she's not the chosen one.
you are.
Yes, I know.
I know.
ready? -I got it okay, we're set.
and now we wait.
what happens if the cylons don't dance to the major's tune?
what happens is we get splattered all over these rocks.
shut up. This is his game, not ours.
we just do what we're told, and maybe we get out of here.
you really think these civvies can stop them?
well, they stopped plenty of them on caprica when we were running for our lives.
okay, three clankers just entered our kill zone.
gotta be their recon element.
Sykes, give 'em the signal.
all right, showtime, showtime.
they're headed our way.
don't detonate till they're all the way in.
wait for it.
come on, you sons of bitches.
come on.
now, now, now, now.
look out!
Aah! man down!
cease fire!
they're pulling back! They're pulling back!
Oh, frak!
gods damn it!
come on!
damn it.
Oh, frak, frak.
okay, this man's dead. We gotta pull him back.
Sam, pull it together.
we bought ourselves a little time but they'll be back. And with force.
so dig in.
we'll need to hold them off until chief finds the eye.
and keep your eyes out on those ridges.
you have any word from kara or dee?
no.
Starbuck?
star-- -dee, why the hell didn't you sing out?
I almost blew you away.
Yeah. Glad to see you too.
okay, okay.
it's okay, yeah.
lee sent you?
Yep.
my husband...
ordered me to risk my life for yours.
that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna bring starbuck back to apollo.
she's here.
it's me.
it's mommy.
what's wrong?
we tried everything.
she didn't respond.
look at that.
Hera knows her.
that's amazing.
you and she are biologically identical.
Hera recognizes her mother.
well, good, because you can have her.
I'm done with her.
you don't mean that.
I know you still care about tyrol and adama.
no.
I'm done with that part of my life.
I learned that on new caprica.
humans and cylons were not meant to be together.
we should just go our separate ways.
wanna lay down?
her belly's as hard as a rock.
have you noticed that before?
what do you think that means?
blocked intestine, maybe.
our doctors examined her.
well, your doctors have never examined a child.
Hera needs to be seen by a human doctor.
I need to take her back to galactica.
you know that can't happen, what this child means to us.
what she means to every living cylon.
I should have known. She's been planning this all alone.
feel her.
she's right.
belly's as hard as a gourd.
if you don't let me take her the first of a new generation will die.
God will never forgive you.
maybe cavil's right.
maybe god never wanted us to have children in the first place.
maybe it'd be better for you if I just snapped your little neck!
don't!
please.
please don't kill my baby girl.
honey, oh.
I believe the future of the cylon rests with this child.
and the others who are gonna come after her.
so do I.
there's a captured raptor aboard.
let's go.
we've gotta get you back to galactica.
here they come.
open fire!
tell 'em to blow the thing!
the cylons are closing in!
it's the major.
Tyrol. -tell me you've found the eye of jupiter.
no, but I'm getting close, major.
I've deciphered some more of the glyphs.
I got a reference to an eye something about a star, and an explosion of some kind.
all right, cut to the chase, chief.
do you have the eye of jupiter in your hands or not?
no, major.
Oh, cylon!
it's hot!
all right, chief, listen to me: That's it!
get your people to the rally point and blow the temple.
I repeat, blow the temple.
Yes, sir. Damn it.
all right, fall back!
Mathias, fall back!
fall back! Fall back!
all right, that's it, everybody.
drop what you're doing and get out.
that means you, too, cally. Come on!
leave the gear! Go!
if I only had a little more time.
Galen...
it's in the hands of the gods now, galen.
let's go.
there's nothing we can do!
the ship's structurally intact.
okay.
that means that the only thing keeping us grounded is the busted fly-by-wire.
so...
you gotta bypass those bundles with datacord from the com system.
and then we...
we may have a shot at getting out of here.
God!
there's only one left.
better save it for when you fly us out of here.
I can't fly.
especially all whacked up on morph.
well, that's just frakkin' great.
he won't cheat.
he's too honorable.
unlike you.
Yeah, unlike me.
I love sam.
I hate sam.
I love lee.
I hate lee.
gods, I have to cheat just to keep the pieces all nice and neat.
stay with it.
you still gotta walk me through these avionics.
the cylons have reached the temple.
chief, what's your status?
I'm wiring the last detonator.
the eye of jupiter has to be somewhere in this temple.
they've wired it with explosives.
let's disconnect it.
pull out the detonators.
quickly.
chief, blow this thing!
you out of your frakkin' mind?
I can't do it.
Gaius!
yes?
help us!
Yeah.
give me the control!
this just about does it.
frak!
what have you done?
what have you done?
major, look.
what is that?
there it is, gaius.
it has the answers to all of your questions.
that's the eye?
what is?
Oh, uh...
something the hybrid said, uh...
sapphire blue.
shining like unto a star.
D'anna...
you didn't come here looking for earth.
you came here looking for something else.
picking up massive energy pulse from the central star.
sir, it's a helium flash. The star's going nova.
Nova's gonna obliterate the entire planet in less than an hour.
major, look.
it's the mandala from the temple.
this is supposed to be happening.
that's it.
I was staring at it the whole time.
the sun is going nova.
the nova is the eye of jupiter.
all right, we can still blow it.
we can still blow it.
we just gotta make it into orbit.
Galactica will find us from there, okay?
OK
good.
this is my destiny.
to see what lies between life and death.
and to look upon the faces of the final five.
that can't happen.
this is my destiny.
sorry, d'anna.
the final five.
is it really you?
you.
forgive me, I-- I had no idea.
no idea about what?
what did you see?
what...
who was it?
it was beautiful.
what was?
tell me! Am I one of you?
you were right.
about what?
D'anna, did you see my face?
I have to know, please.
please, stay with me. Stay, I have to know!
tell me, I have to know! Did you see my face?!
am I a cylon?
frak.
God, tell me the truth before I die.
welcome home, mr. President.
Admiral, the cylon fleet just jumped away.
they don't wanna be here when that nova shock front gets here.
neither do we.
launch a rescue mission, now.
we don't have much time before the nova fries everything in the system.
it's gonna be a photo finish.
all rescue ships from the planet accounted for.
count us down!
commence ftl. -Commence ftl.
jump in three...
two...
one.
I got it.
he's not dead?
no, unfortunately.
take him to the bridge.
we have to get her to doc cottle right away.
okay.
xxxxx
hold your fire! Hold your fire.
she helped us escape.
get out of the way!
lieutenant...
Sharon...
I think the chief is right.
I think the nova does look like the mandala inside of this temple.
do you think the 13th tribe had a vision of what was to come?
I don't know what else it could mean.
maybe they saw another nova, and drew a picture of that.
you've seen one nova, you've seen them all.
there was another nova.
seen 4, 000 years ago, around about when the temple might have been built.
it's 13, 000 light years from our present position.
it's a cloud of gas known as the ionian nebula.
maybe it was a road sign...
showing the direction that they headed to next.
so starbuck, tell me, is that what you gotta do to get a little extra rack time around here?
did you just come by to frak with me?
actually, I wanted to know if you had any, uh...
pictures of your old apartment on caprica.
um...
Yeah.
uh...
the locker, top shelf.
cigar box.
Why?
I'm curious about something.
well, I hope you and sharon aren't planning on redecorating, 'cause you're not gonna get any bright ideas from my old place.
Oh, I remember.
I've seen better looking train wrecks.
Oh, thank you.
but I do remember those paintings you did.
what about them?
this...
was on the temple.
Where'd you get the idea to paint yours?
I don't know.
it was just something I've been doodling since I was a kid.
I liked the pattern.
well...
they built the temple 4, 000 years ago.
what is it?
just something leoben said once.
that I had a destiny.
that it had already been written.
you know the drill.
long, deep, controlled breathing.
at least you'll never have to go through this again.
the decision wasn't easy, but the conclusion was inevitable.
your model is fundamentally flawed.
no.
it's not a flaw to question your purpose.
is it?
to wonder who programmed us, the way we think and why?
well, that's the problem right there.
the messianic conviction that you're on a special mission to enlighten us.
look at the damage it's caused.
I would do it all again.
Yes, we know.
that's why we've decided to...
box your entire line.
your consciousness, memory, every thought your model ever had...
are going into cold storage.
indefinitely.
one must die to know the truth.
there are five other cylons, brother.
I saw them.
one day, you're gonna see them too.
one day.
good-bye.
brother...
one day.
brother...
it has been said that there are only two dates that matter to Mars.
the first is the day that the Earth laid claim to it.
the second is the day the Earth was driven from it.
twenty-five years ago today, Mars became a free planet.
free from the tyranny of the Earth Defense Force.
for 200 years, the E. D. F. ruled Mars with an iron fist.
our once proud mining colonies had become internment camps.
generations who considered themselves Martians...
had become slaves on their own planet.
until one day, a small group of rebels said "No more.
they called themselves Red Faction.
they were led by Alec Mason, hero of the revolution.
Hey, it is you.
but Red Faction couldn't defeat E. D. F. alone. - Man, let me buy you a drink.
they formed an alliance with the Marauders...
once the E. D. F. was destroyed.
the alliance was broken when Marauders killed Mason's wife and daughter.
what are you having? - They fought and bled...
red blood on our red planet - A solitary moment.
until the E. D.F. was finally defeated.
forced to leave Mars, never to return.
my fellow Martians, I urge you to stop.
stop and remember.
on this day, generations ago
you're just too good to have a drink with me, is that it?
when dawn broke, we were in chains.
when our twin moons rose, we were free men.
backup is four minutes out.
do not engage.
I repeat, do not engage. Copy?
do you
Alec Mason, you're under arrest for drunk and disorderly and disturbing the peace... again.
get outta here, you drunk!
let's go, Dad.
with the computer upgrades I'm proposing,
I think we can increase Red Faction's total output by at least
ms. De La Vega, I will consider your request, but if you'll excuse me,
lt. Mason and I have got things to talk about.
what do you think you were doing?
what was I supposed to do?
wait four minutes for backup like I told you.
why couldn't you just do - Is this because I was born on Earth?
are you accusing me of being prejudiced against Terrans?
no, sir. I just was not sure if you were aware...
upon which planet I was born... on.
you could be born on Pluto for all I care...
so long as you do your job well.
but - And give me the proper respect.
now, can you guess which one of those...I think you need to work on?
I'm sure today was tough for you.
just a day.
a day when it's a little harder for you to forget that you're Alec Mason's son.
I find that very easy.
there's no paperwork on this one.
I spoke to the saloon.
they've decided not to press charges.
aren't you two even yet?
there is no even for what your dad did for me.
you're free to go.
it's cold out.
Terraformers make the air breathable.
they don't make Mars closer to the sun.
want a drink?
why don't you sleep it off?
sobriety only happens if you let it, Son.
you really kept the place up since I moved out.
Yeah.
this is what Mom would want for you?
the dead don't want anything.
it's one of the benefits of being dead.
mother, come!
Jake, please, I'm scared!
what's the matter with you?
I gotta go.
Hey.
Hey, you were really great outside the saloon tonight.
you reminded me of me.
I hope not.
the E. D. F. Dreadnought Hydra.
we blew it up on the final day of the revolution.
the fuselage has been in a graduated decay orbit ever since.
the tail section is set to make planetfall approximately 1814.
satellite telemetry has it crashing somewhere near Bradbury.
Bradbury?
that's - Disputed territory.
just on our side of the Marauders' defense perimeter.
we're sure the Marauders know when and where the Hydra is coming down too.
that's why it is imperative that we stake our claim first.
Mason, your team will travel to the drop zone.
assess and recover any salvageable E. D. F. technology.
all due respect, sir,
I wouldn't know a useful piece of E. D. F. tech from an electric razor.
that's why you'll be taking along an expert.
ms. De La Vega?
all right. We're 30 clicks from Bradbury.
keep us up top.
don't want any Marauders taking a lucky shot at us.
you okay? - Why wouldn't I be?
that actually does hurt.
sorry.
I really don't like travel, you know, especially out of Eos.
so you were born on Earth?
Yeah, why? Is that a problem?
not for me. - Good.
do you think that you could talk to me?
maybe just keep my mind off the turbulence.
I'm not much of a talker.
tell me about your family.
it must have been really embarrassing having to arrest your dad the other day.
I'm beginning to get why I see you eating meals by yourself.
you're one to talk.
what's that noise?
anomaly.
we're okay! We're okay!
I've heard about anomalies, that they were real, but I never
they happen randomly at the far edge of a terraformer's range.
unexplained phenomenon.
usually they make things explode.
but this ship won't.
good ship.
sir, you're gonna wanna see this.
where do you want me to land?
two and twos. Ez, establish a perimeter.
if you come into contact with Marauders, report it A. S. A. P.
do not engage, but defend yourselves if necessary.
Tess, you are with me.
crack it. - Sir!
there's lots of micro fractures.
it's cold shearing from being in space for so long.
I don't even know if any of this stuff is going to be salvageable.
It's-Whoa! Whoa!
he must've been flash-frozen when the hull was breached.
I think now's a good time to go back to the ship.
I think now's a good time for you to take a deep breath.
we have a job to do, and I need you.
you are the best, right?
by far.
okay. Okay.
there's, um -There's still activity.
it's that way.
marauders.
sir, I can't raise Lt. Mason.
Jake, please, I'm scared!
Lyra, jump!
marauders.
I know. Stay here.
where are you going?
Jake, come in.
Jake! Are you all right?
we had every right to claim the wreck.
that land does not belong to Eos.
nor did the lives of my tribesmen, yet you sent them from Mars just the same.
we did not kill your Marauders.
their wounds were inflicted by gunfire.
colonist weapons. Colonist duplicity.
our forces were securing a hazardous crash site...
when they were attacked unprovoked.
as is always the case with Colonists, you speak only in half truths.
know this to be the full truth
any further incursions into my territories...
will be considered a hostile act.
any Colonist found trespassing on Marauder lands...
will be summarily executed.
that is a promise I will honor.
the Matriarch is telling the truth.
it wasn't Marauders. That group on the Hydra?
they were soldiers in white fatigues.
and one of these soldiers, she was a girl.
20 years old, Ben.
Ben, look at me.
it was her.
who?
this girl, when she saw me, it was like she knew too.
she's alive.
my sister is alive.
this isn't a wish. This isn't a dream.
it's a fact.
can you accept that?
I didn't think you partook.
it's water.
mind if I sit?
shouldn't you ask the owner since you helped trash this place the other night?
Ben smoothed that over.
he could always talk, that Ben.
talked me into doing stuff I didn't wanna do.
I wonder, can he talk you out of something you wanna do, no matter how stupid?
he shouldn't have called you.
maybe he thought you'd listen to me.
he wouldn't think that.
I've seen your sister, Jake.
just the other day, I saw some girl in town wearing her smile.
saw her eyes peering out of someone else's face.
her silly laugh coming out of some child's mouth, loud like a mine drill.
and for a second, time freezes, and she's alive...
with my Sam and we're
then the second hand moves, and she's dead.
they both are.
marauders killed them.
this girl you saw, it wasn't her.
you need to accept that.
you've done a great job accepting things.
I don't drink because I haven't accepted it.
I drink because I have.
let it go.
Hi.
what are you doing here?
well, good morning to you too.
I'm serious. - I'm serious too.
I really want you to have a good morning.
and it is not gonna be a good morning for you, if Major Sharpe discovers you disobeyed orders and went back to the Hydra.
who says that's where I'm going?
me. And I'm going with you.
no, you're not.
I've been going over the scans I took of the wreckage yesterday.
that section of the Hydra had an intact communications array:
cobalt-level convertors, nuclear bolts, nanotechnology, iodine reactors.
that stuff is valuable tech.
it's all worth a lot.
Hey, your white soldiers?
they didn't take any of it.
I wanna know what was in that cylinder that was more valuable.
that's a pretty flimsy reason for you to wanna go.
it's not any flimsier than looking for your long-lost sister...
everybody else thinks is dead.
I know where they went.
tell me. - Take me.
take a look.
yeah?
terraformer.
Hey, Tess? - Yeah.
hang on.
we're in the Bakhuysen Trench.
red Faction won't be able to track us here.
satellites don't bother to scan this area.
because flying through here is insanity.
better tighten your straps then.
Why? Why? Because if I'm strapped in when this thing crashes and explodes, - I'm gonna be just fine? - Okay, Tess, where we headed?
Asimov.
I extrapolated the white soldiers' course. It's the only possible destination
asimov is in neutral territory, in the Outlands.
Yeah, we kinda gotta cross through Marauder Nation to get there.
all right, see down there?
that's Heinlein.
what is that?
it's a mining community?
the guy who runs the place is named McAuley.
he's a good man. Friend of mine. My name carries weight with him.
what does, uh, Heinlein have to do with Asimov?
you know how you hate flying, Tess?
yeah?
now you're really gonna hate it.
Tess, you okay?
no, I am not okay! Are you insane?
I'm sorry. I can't take you with me.
find my pal McAuley. He'll get you back to Eos.
I will get you for this, you son of a
Jake deserted.
why didn't
I thought he would obey my orders.
if you thought that, then why'd you have me talk to him?
Alec, we need to stop him before he enters the Marauders' territory.
do you have any way to contact him?
you believe him about Lyra?
I believe that he believes it.
he says she's with the white soldiers who were there the day when
the day Sam died.
she was murdered.
the Marauders, who thought she was a traitor for marrying me.
probably get a parade for their glorious efforts.
Jake always said it was the white soldiers.
Jake was 10 years old.
he'd just seen his mother killed.
did you ever find any evidence of these phantom white soldiers?
it's just his brain playing tricks.
wish mine would do it too.
maybe he just needed you to believe him anyway.
maybe." It's about the worst word there ever was.
I don't wanna kill you.
funny, I was just thinking exactly the opposite.
drop the gun!
if I don't? - I break your neck.
not before I blow a hole through his head.
kill him. - Be quiet!
drop your weapon.
are you carrying a singularity bomb?
all Marauders carry singularity bombs.
the fuses last 15 seconds, right?
Why?
because you've got 10 seconds to live.
give me the pin. - Drop the staff.
give me the pin!
Hey! Hey!
marauders always honor a mortal debt, and a mortal debt is what you now owe me.
you cannot kill me.
how do you figure?
I did just save you from being crushed into atoms by a singularity bomb.
you are as crazy as a rock eater.
I like that.
Ah, ta, ta!
sorry about your tent.
my nephew gets excited by new faces.
he's a Colonist. He should not be here, Uncle.
well, we are honored.
not many Colonists know Marauder traditions.
my mother was a Marauder.
her name was Samanya.
you're Jake Mason?
that a good or a bad thing?
well, depends on what you think of...
Marauder females marrying outside the tribe.
luckily for you, it doesn't bother me in the slightest.
love doesn't know from maps, hey?
I, Corvallis.
and this fiery young pup is Leo.
Where'd you get that?
it was a gift...
from my mother...
before she died.
my mother's dead too.
your mother was a traitor.
marauders are taught that all Colonists are drunkards and heathens.
we're told you're a bunch of gun-toting savages...
who kidnap children in the middle of the night.
I guess we don't know as much about each other as we think.
his trouble is he knows all the wrong stuff.
every Marauder must face the wandering. His is not yet complete.
my nephew's right.
you should not be this side of the Marauder Frontier.
did you get lost?
I need to get to Asimov.
Asimov.
what would you want there apart from drugs, gambling and the company of degenerates?
in your travels, you ever come across a group of soldiers...
wearing white fatigues?
can't say I have.
I need to find them.
Why? They take something from you?
they took everything from me.
well, we wouldn't be fulfilling our mortal debt...
if we left you out here to be killed, hey?
we'll see you to Asimov.
leave it alone.
I thought you didn't drink.
when in Asimov
wait.
how old are you?
sixteen.
I like older men.
your daddy? - Get off, would ya?
no, he's not my father.
good.
what'll you have?
name of the man who gets things done in this town.
and water.
the name will take a minute.
something wrong with your water?
you got that name yet?
someone's here to see you.
it took you long enough.
in my defense, we are a long way from home.
the safety's on.
no, it's not.
I've been driving for two days. Can I please have a sip of that?
it's drugged.
why did you drug your own water?
I didn't. The bartender did.
why would he do that?
cause the man I wanna see is involved in the black market.
he might not wanna be seen.
how the hell did you get here?
Oh, your friend McAuley who runs Heinlein, who, by the way, is a really great guy, he lent me the vehicle.
and then I hacked into the Marauder satellite - Why did you follow me, Tess?
I figured out what the white soldiers took from the Hydra.
look, It's called a firework.
it's a power converter.
in and of itself, it's not really all that dangerous, but it is what creates the spark.
the spark in what?
an E. D. F. fusion reactor.
it's what they use to power their weapons, their ships, their everything.
I think that there might be more at stake here than just finding your sister.
not for me.
how do you even know that it's her?
everybody else thinks you're nuts, you know.
what do you think?
I think you really miss her.
every day, since the day my, uh, sister was taken, my dad has wanted to ask me a question.
I saw it in his eyes when I woke up in the hospital.
I saw it the other day...
when we were fighting.
one question always on his tongue, but never asked aloud:
how could you leave your sister behind?
he'll never have to ask that again.
have you ever been with a girl?
Yeah.
next time someone asks you that, how'd you like to be telling them the truth?
just once I'd like to see someone not fall for that.
take him.
I hear you've been looking for me.
something wrong with your water?
I'm looking for a group of soldiers.
they wear white uniforms.
we know they've been in the market for an E. D. F. firework.
well, as it happens, I did do a tran
I did do a transaction recently with some soldiers.
they were in white uniform.
they were cold people.
I sold them some highly specialized ammunition.
it's very difficult to procure.
Hey!
drop him.
I've heard some men make their own opportunities...
by selling black market goods embedded with tracking devices...so they could
uh, trace them, steal them back and resell them.
the man who would think that would not be stupid. In fact, he'd be very clever.
how much?
Oh, for the tracking codes. Well, why don't we say 2, 000?
okay, are you kidding me?
do you think I'm just walking around with that kind of money?
well, the man who wants that is.
Oh, unless you've got something else you'd like to trade?
no. Right.
no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, dear.
look, go home, Red Faction.
go live a long and stupid life. Now, cheerio.
damn it.
I make my own opportunities too.
I remote cracked the hardgate on his tracker, and I downloaded the codes.
you wanna find the white soldiers?
this is gonna take us right to them.
you know how normally I'm the smartest person in the room?
it's 'cause I'm the smartest person in the room.
I should have sold you.
are you all right?
who were they?
they're scavengers.
thought they could kidnap the boy and sell him back to his tribe for a ransom.
Oh, dear.
just as well they didn't know you were worth less than nothing, eh?
I-I called your mother a traitor, but you still saved me, why?
I was more upset you hacked up my tent.
according to this, they're somewhere inside the Madler Crater.
how much did you have to drink in there?
no one goes near the Madler Crater.
why not?
it's at the center of three terraformer ranges.
it's surrounded by anomalies.
if there is a hell, believe me, it is envious of the Madler Crater.
thanks for getting me this far.
time has been unkind to you, Alec Mason.
time and everyone else on Mars.
if your congress believes...
that my resolve will weaken to a known face, they are more foolish than I thought.
this is a personal call. - Really?
they will trace your signal.
this is a treasonous act. - It's my son.
he entered your kingdom.
knowing it is upon penalty of death?
the great Alec Mason, begging for the life of his heir.
I remember many years ago, fighting in the revolution, watching you yield the Nano Forge against the E.D.F...
like a god of Old Earth.
if Samanya could see you now -- Well, you could ask her.
if your men hadn't killed her...a few feet from where - Marauders did not kill her.
Omaya. - I have not given you my name to speak.
you can have your name back.
just give me my son.
I cannot spare the life of one already dead.
Alec, open the door.
all these years, she was here.
with all the anomalistic energy slamming into the crater, it's the perfect hiding space. Satellites would never find it.
I want you to stay up here.
there's fairly heavy security down there.
can you hack in from up here? Open any locked doors?
I think I've proven I can hack into anything from anywhere.
but why do I have to stay up here? It's freezing?
cause if I don't make it back, someone's going to have warn Eos.
you were right. It's more important than my family.
don't get yourself killed.
sergeant! - Ivan, wait.
I think he might be my brother.
I'm never leaving Eos again.
sir. - Sir.
sir.
you summoned me.
we've captured a prisoner. He's from Red Faction.
do they know of our intent? - No.
Lyra believes the prisoner is Jake Mason, her brother.
your brother is dead. - I ordered a genome match.
it's him. - I want an explanation.
you want me to tell you again how you came to be with us?
now I want the truth.
I was out on patrol. We came across a burnt-out transport.
I found you lying next to the wreckage.
the transport was full of bodies-burned bodies - I assumed your family.
but I could not leave you out there, hurt and alone.
so I brought you back here, with us.
and watched you grow with great pride.
now that's the story you've heard a thousand times.
and a thousand times, it's been the truth.
I'm sorry I doubted.
is that really what happened?
when your father was still alive, he once confided in me that the great burden of leadership...
is to always know the truth, no matter how badly you want to believe the lie.
do you want this burden?
the truth then, if you please.
there was an outbreak of influenza in the compound...
that first year after the revolution.
our young were decimated. Population collapse had begun.
the only way to survive was to recruit.
how many were taken?
Lyra was not the only one.
although she was one of the ones specifically targeted.
her father was an enemy of the White Faction.
taking her served two purposes.
if repopulating our ranks was one, what was the other?
a reckoning, Adam.
Alec Mason killed your father.
they're gonna kill us, aren't they?
well, if they are E. D. F. , maybe they'll go easy on you.
being a fellow Earthman and all.
I know that you're kidding, but it's not easy being Earth-born.
you know, I have to work twice as hard as everybody else...
to prove that this is my home, that I belong to Mars.
you're as big a pain in the ass as I've ever met.
if that doesn't make you a Martian, I don't know what does.
I'm-I'm sorry. I thought I'd have something better to say.
I was told you were dead.
I'm not.
kinda hoping it can stay that way.
no one here will hurt you.
well, yeah, except for pretty much kicking my ass.
I didn't know it was you. - That's okay. We'll call it payback...
for that time Mom and Dad took us camping on Mount Le Guin and...
I accidently set your sleeve on fire.
barbecued Lyra. Remember?
I don't remember them.
they remember you.
if you were all alive, why didn't you look for me?
dad looked for you... for years.
he hasn't been the same since the day you were kidnapped.
I wasn't kidnapped. I was rescued.
you don't remember what happened?
these people you think saved you
they came into our home.
they killed Mom.
right in front of our eyes.
I tried to-I tried to get you to jump with me.
and you were so scared.
and... I didn't mean to let go.
and I'm sorry.
you're lying. - I'm not. Lyra-Lyra, listen to me.
Lyra, you have to listen!
Lyra. Are you all right? - I'm fine.
I won't let him be harmed. - I know.
look, this is a lot to process. Me too.
to discover after all this time you have a family.
you're my family.
we have to get out of here.
I fully support that course of action. How?
take your shirt off. - What?
take your shirt off. - Why?
get a guard's attention. He will come in, see you, be distracted.
maybe I get the jump on him. - No!
Tess, if it makes you feel any better, there aren't anyone's breasts on this planet that I want to see less.
it does not make me feel better. On many levels. - Tess!
okay? - Okay. Okay!
turn around.
okay? - Okay, I'm ready.
okay.
I need some help in here, please! Somebody, please!
somebody better come kill you soon.
nice. - Thanks.
uncle, I-I do not -- a mortal debt is a mortal debt.
commander Hale. - What is it?
Mason has escaped.
we're on our way.
where is he?
you gonna make this easy?
you gonna make this hard?
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
not this one! Not this one!
tell me you have a way out of here.
come on. - Come on!
he's gone. - You all right?
how did he escape?
he had help. - Did he?
if he warns Red Faction or the Marauders of our true intentions, a generation of planning and suffering will have
will have been for nothing.
then there's no further reason to delay.
we need to accelerate the plan. Activate the firework.
look. What is it?
that's why they needed the firework from the Hydra.
the E. D. F. fortress. It's a dreadnought.
and it's headed straight for Eos.
the dreadnought's jamming communication.
I'm gonna have to drop you guys off somewhere, get back to Eos, warn them.
Leo, take over. - Yeah.
hurry.
cannot fly the ship and keep pressure on her wound. She will die.
you're not gonna be very welcome in Eos. - We're not very welcome anywhere.
400 kilometers, sir. Railgun locked on Eos.
satellite still can't detect us.
multiple hits, sir. Railgun powering down.
how many dead? - As many as it takes.
we have drawn first blood.
red Faction will believe it was Marauders who attacked them.
we're too late.
this way! Right there.
No! No, no. No, no.
what is going on in Eos? Our satellites show weapons discharge.
how could a people so sanctimoniously steeped in honor...
kill innocent civilians from a comfortable distance?
this ammunition was found in the rubble.
it bears Marauder markings.
you haven't simply abandoned society. You've abandoned all pretense of humanity.
we did not attack you. - I know, Matriarch.
it was the E. D. F.
we drove them from the surface of Mars long before you were born.
not all of them. - Get that man out of here.
wait. Your face
I see your foremother in it.
you still live, Jake Mason, son of the traitor.
now I wouldn't be surprised if you had arranged this attack yourselves...
to whet your people's appetite for battle.
you may have struck first, but we will strike harder.
you will launch an air offensive against the Marauders within the hour.
you can't do that. - And you will arrest this man.
on what charge? - Desertion.
consorting with the enemy. Treason. And war crimes.
speaker Ludlum, I don't think it's necessary -- You do not think, Major.
you follow orders.
dad.
Jake. You're alive.
dad, congress is declaring war on the Marauders.
you need to talk to Ben, get him to stop the attack.
why would I do that? - The E. D. F. - some of them survived the revolution.
they didn't have the numbers to take on both Marauders and Colonists.
but if they can trick us into going to war with each other, we conquer ourselves.
they're the ones. They killed Mom and kidnapped Lyra.
I found her, Dad. I found Lyra.
if you found her, why didn't you bring her back home?
because we're not her home anymore.
this is insane. - You know, as much as you blame me...
for leaving her behind, you left me behind too!
if you could stop hating me for just one second, maybe we could get her back.
you, uh, Colonists don't make very good cages, do you?
are you coming?
go. Go, go.
want me to drive? - Want me to kick your ass?
what's the plan?
the shuttle's equipped with thermobaric missiles.
we rescue Lyra from the dreadnought, we blow it straight to hell.
where to you think the dreadnought is now?
Bakhuysen Trench. None of our satellites scan there.
marauders would never know what hit them. Just like Eos.
we're within firing distance of the Marauders' Palace.
bring the railgun to 100%. - Railgun charging.
to bring them peace... we must bring them war.
man, that's big.
give us 10 minutes to find Lyra.
after that, light her up, whether we're back or not.
railgun at 25% and rising. We have a hard target lock on the Marauder Palace.
railgun at 45%. Telemetry nominal.
intruder alert, Sector 7.
intruder alert, Sector 7.
it's Mason! Lyra's quarters.
intruder alert, Sector 7.
they know.
she's been aiding them all along. They know everything.
you let him back on this ship.
you betrayed us.
Lyra's room is down this way. Cover my back.
until we leave Mars.
love how you guys say "die.
how many do you want? - All of them.
get away from him. - No.
you can't leave.
Yes, I can.
and you can come with me.
as what? A Colonist slave?
I am Adam Hale.
and I will not run from my destiny.
our destinies were stolen.
Adam - We were gonna build a new world.
a new Mars. Together.
everything has been a lie.
we weren't.
come with me.
dad, we are ready for that ride.
let's go. Let's get to a safe distance, launch the missiles.
hang on.
watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it. 200. 9: 00.
Yeah, I got it.
dad, more inbound.
you got a lock. You got a lock. - All right.
brace for impact!
everyone okay back there? - Compared to what?
I'm fine.
last time I saw you, you were...
smaller.
go.
the railgun is at 62% and climbing.
uh, realign the railgun 32 degrees east, five degrees south.
sir? - Do it!
sir, that's the Bakhuysen Terraformer.
it generates the atmosphere surrounding Eos and the Marauder Nation.
if we destroy this, this whole section of Mars will be -- Uninhabitable.
the atmosphere will be torn apart.
do it.
they're retargeting the railgun.
they're aiming southwest. What-What's in that direction?
the terraformer.
Jake! - Tess? Tess, you're okay?
I re-tasked our satellites and I found the dreadnought. It was in the Bakhuysen Trench.
red Faction is calling off the attack on the Marauders. - No. No, no, no, no, no.
you need to get the fleet out of here now, Tess. Hale is targeting the terraformer.
Jake, I can't. They're way too far out. They'll never get back in time.
look, the shuttle's damaged. I can't fire the missiles.
you don't happen to still have a good old ship, do you?
maybe. Why? - Okay.
if you destabilize the engines and crash the ship into the dreadnought
turn the shuttle into a bomb.
I know you know where that eject switch is, Jake. Make sure you use it.
after I lock the stick, I'll bail out at about 200 meters.
hopefully that'll be far enough to clear me from the ex
dad, what are you doing? What are you doing? Dad!
Hey, Dad? Dad, you don't have to do this.
the ship's reactor was damaged in the crash.
it'll go nuclear on impact.
dad, you-you don't have to do this. You can get out in time. You can bail out.
if someone's on the stick, the shuttle won't hit the target in one piece.
railgun is at 95%.
it's my turn.
one last swing of the hammer.
dad, please.
you know, I told you that you reminded me a lot of me.
that's not the truth.
truth is, Son，
you're a better man than I ever was.
you were able to help me fulfill a promise I made to your mother... that I was never able to keep.
brought your sister back.
thank you, Son. Thank you.
Lyra, can you hear me?
Yes.
you're as
you're as beautiful as your mother.
I love you.
you're home now, sweetheart.
you're home.
I never thought I would see the day...
when I would set foot in Eos.
nor I the day I would welcome you to it.
your father's sacrifice will not be forgotten.
he was a good man.
he was.
lieutenant Mason has a proposition for us.
the old Mars... is gone.
my father ended that world.
and we... need to create a new one.
a world where we use our differences, our knowledge and-and our faith...
to keep our people safe.
what do you propose?
first step - a new faction...
comprised of both Marauders and Colonists.
a force empowered to protect both of our nations.
a unit which could show that...
maybe, in the end, no matter which tribe we belong to, we are all Martians.
there will be resistance to this idea.
I am not certain any of my warriors will be so
is it your wish to join Red Faction, Leonid?
there is no place for me in your world.
a place could be made.
I will never be what you want, Mother.
you fought bravely.
you've learned the lesson of the wandering. Come home.
what my wandering taught me is that...
I need to join this new faction.
want... and need...
are two very different things, Leonid.
very well.
on an occasion like this, it is custom to exchange gifts.
this belonged to my mother.
I will kill someone you hate with this.
that... sounds great.
so, we're starting a new Red Faction.
I want to sign up. - no
excuse me?
I'm just not sure I'm comfortable having someone like you on the team.
you know, someone from Earth.
what? Are you kidding me? After everything we've been through?
God, did I misjudge you, Jake.
that you, of all people, would subscribe to that kind of bigoted, ignorant world view.
I just-I just-I just-I'm already on the team, aren't I?
you are the smart one, Tess.
sorry. It's kind of-kind of messy.
I-I gotta warn you. No one went up there very much.
just a matter of minutes.
are we prepared to cloak the city?
Yes, I've made all the necessary modifications, but for the record, I still say the shield is a better idea.
look, that cloak offers us no protection whatsoever.
if that hive opens up on us-- -how could they do that?
they'd have to know our exact position on the planet.
what, you're assuming they don't?
look, we've been tracking them for days!
they're headed straight for us.
I think it's safe to say they've got some inside information!
even so, it's better not to confirm our locationuntil we know for sure.
no sense in giving theman easy target to shoot at.
Colonel Sheppard, what's your status?
standing by.
be prepared to fire drones on my mark.
copy that. Just say the word.
well, I suppose we're as prepared as we can be.
engage the cloak.
all right.
okay.
cloak's engaged.
they should be here momentarily.
what's happening?
nothing.
from what as I can tell, they're just sitting there.
do they know we're here?
hang on.
I'm receiving a transmission.
it's a file of some kind.
pull it up on a firewalled computer.
what's it say?
it's nothing-- just a random bunch of...
wait a second.
what is it?
well, it's encrypted.
using the same kind of algorithmwe use on thedaedalus.
hold your fire...Gene therapy developed...By Dr. Keller
what's going on?
I don't know.
looks like the file's corrupted somehow...
initial results unable to counteract the disease...
help us.
what on earth does that mean?
I have no idea.
what do you mean, you didn't understand him?
the file was corrupted.
we were only able to catch a few wordshere and there.
though, from what we could tell, it seemed like he was asking for our help.
with what?
something to do with Jennifer's gene therapy?
well, we gave him a chance to test it.
he double-crossed us.
I say we blow him out of the sky.
I can't say I disagree with you.
though I do find it odd he would just show up here, knowing that would likely be our reaction.
and why send a file?
why not just radio us directly?
whatever he wants, it must be really important.
perhaps we should answer back.
tell him that we did not receive the file properly?
if we do that, we might as well just drop the cloak.
they'll be able to trace our radio signal, know exactly where we are.
no.
we might be able to do it from a jumper, though.
approach the hive cloaked, and communicate with them from there.
then they would be able to pinpoint the jumper's location.
Yes, but the jumper's a lot more maneuverable than the city.
look, besides, this isn't the first timewe've flown up to todd's doorstep in a jumper.
any chance you could clean up that video?
piece together more of what he's saying?
no, there's too much data missing.
that is as good as we're going to get.
all right.
Colonel?
on my way.
coming up on it now.
this is Colonel John Sheppard.
please come in.
we didn't receive your video transmission correctly.
please respond.
are they getting this?
Yeah, they should be. I mean, there's no reason why they w
whoa...
what is it?
I'm not picking up any life-signs on board.
what?
I believe Rodney is correct.
I have also not been able to detectthe presence of any Wraith.
I thought it was because we were too far, but this makes more sense.
it does?
this better not be a wraith ship from another reality.
we've been tracking their approach for a few days now, remember?
it didn't just pop into our space like that other Daedalus did.
look, we know that they don't show upon our scans when they're hibernating.
I'd say that's probably a more logical explanation.
hibernating. All of them?
well, they could've pre-programmed the ship to fly here on its own, enter orbit, even send a pre-recorded signal.
Why?
well, there's only one way to find out.
we're receiving a signal.
it's Colonel Sheppard on a secure channel.
patch me in.
Colonel, what's happening up there?
well, the Wraith have thrown us a little curve ball here.
got no life signs on board. We think they're hibernating.
why would they do that?
that's what we'd like to find out, but it means boarding the ship.
are you sure that's wise? What if it's a trap?
well, if it is, it's a pretty lousy one.
if they ambush us, you can still take 'em out from down there.
sacrificing your lives.
I'm flattered you think Todd would go to so much trouble to kill me.
look, taking out a hive shipis always a good idea, far as I'm concerned, but we did come all this way, and...
got all dressed up.
all right.
no sign of 'em yet.
why is it that I find empty hiveseven creepier than the ones that are full of wraith?
trust me, we're better off this way.
bridge should be up here.
all right, just...
give me a few seconds.
all right.
well, I was right.
they're all in their hibernation pods.
there's several large chambers in the aft section of the hive.
the weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.
what are you talking about?
well, the normal operating procedurewould be to leave a few crew members awakeso that they could monitor the podsand bring the others out when it's time, but since they all went in, I would assume there'd be some kind of an automaticor timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.
so if we do not wake them...
then they never will.
sounds good to me.
do you do not find it odd that Todd would leave himself and his entire crew to our mercy?
especially after our last encounter?
maybe he's not as smart as you think he is.
what was that?
some kind of power fluctuation.
I'm reading minor malfunctionsin several of the ship's systems.
hang on...
I got Todd's video file. Looks like it's intact.
I thought you said it was corrupted.
well, it must've happened in transmission, some kind of a glitch in the comm system.
the original, it's all there.
let's see it. -All right.
hold your fire. We mean you no harm.
allow me to explain our presence herebefore you take any action.
if you are seeing this message, my ship has arrived safely at Atlantis.
I'm coming to you because my crew and I have been stricken with a disease...
a complication to the gene therapy developed by Dr. Keller
wait a second. We didn't give 'em--...
I acquired some of the formulation while my crew and I were occupying the daedalus.
I admit, I wanted to see if it would actually work.
and it did.
the initial results were nothing short of astonishing.
see for yourself.
I was so impressed, I decided to treat my entire crew.
it was only then that we beganto notice problems.
the first group grew sick and died.
before long, others began to get sick as well.
our natural healing abilitywas unable to counteract the disease.
I have come here as a matter of last resort.
I realize we have had our differences of late, and you may be reluctant to help us...
but remember this
if we die, any hope you may have of distributing this treatment in the future dies with us.
the choice is yours.
all right, so now that we know what happened, we can just fire drones at 'em, and close the file and move on.
you said his feeding hand was clean...
which means the treatment worked, at least for a while.
well, then it started killing them, so I don't know if they're going to exactly line up for this one.
which is why we need to find out exactly what went wrong.
we need to examine every scrap of medical data on that hive.
we may even need to revive a few of the wraith so Dr. Kellercan perform a complete physical evaluation.
I'm sorry, but the IOA is strongly committed to the development of this gene therapy.
it's one of the only things they all agree on.
if it's simply not workable, so be it, but they're going to want to see some proof.
I say it works fine.
it kills wraith. What more do you want?
you're suggesting we keep the formula as is, and find a way of exposing them involuntarily.
why not?
get rid of the wraith once and for all.
don't tell me the IOA would have a problem with that.
the problem is in the delivery systems.
we just went down this road with Beckett's retrovirus.
and even if we do succeed in weaponizing the treatment, it is unlikely that we would wipe out the wraith entirely.
at best, we would weaken them.
I don't have a problem with that.
on the other hand, if we do succeed in eliminating their need to feed, we might be able convince their entire population to take the treatment willingly.
either way, whether it's perfecting the formula as a treatmentor a weapon, we need to gather as much informationas we possibly can, which brings me back to the same conclusion...
we need to go back up there.
this time, have Dr. Keller accompany you, as well as major Lorne's team and another unit of marines.
are you still not sure if it's a trap?
let's just say I've learned to exercise an abundance of caution when dealing with Todd.
all right.
my men have established a perimeter.
they'll be checking in every hour.
I know! I know!
power fluctuations.
look, it's like I said, some of the ship's systems are acting up a little.
well, get it fixed.
Yeah, give me a few minutes.
major Lorne, this is Lieutenant Williams.
go ahead.
sir, you wanted us to report anything unusual?
Yeah, that's right, Lieutenant. What do you got?
well, sir, I was standing watch, and I heard a noise, and...
well, the wall is melting.
sorry? Come again?
wait a minute...I think it stopped.
stand by.
Williams, come in.
lieutenant, please respond.
how you doing?
that good, huh?
I don't know, I mean, I...
I guess I'm making progress.
I found out what was killing them.
you did?
the treatment worked exactly like it was supposed to--it eliminated their feeding hands, it activated their digestive systems, just like it did in the simulation, but, unfortunately, it also createda virulent cancer-like disease at the same time that it was weakening their immune systems.
that's what killed them.
well, is there anything you can do about it?
I don't know. Maybe.
it's possible.
what?
I just feel like I'm in over my head.
what are you talking about?
I look at you, and Colonel Sheppard, the rest of the team...
you guys are so used to making decisions that affect the lives of thousands, and even millions of people.
I'm not so used to having the fate of the galaxy hang in the balance.
Oh, that. You get used to it.
helps to have a massive ego.
look, I don't know much about wraith physiology, but I know you.
and if anyone can make this work, you can.
this is his last known position.
Colonel! We got something over here!
hasn't been fired.
should I call up for some more personnel to help track him down?
no, I got a better idea.
are the ship's schematics loaded into the life-signs detector?
Yeah, I did it when we first got here. Why?
well, we're going to need 'em.
anything?
no, it's just us.
Ronon, Teyla, anything on your end?
I'm afraid not, Colonel.
all right. Stay in touch.
what the hell is this?
it's supposed to be an open corridor.
let me see. -Here.
this schematic you gave us is a piece of crap.
what are you talking about?
there's a dead end that's not on the map.
that's impossible!
look, I'm staring at it right now.
look, I don't know what to tell you, all right?
I pulled that schematic directly from the ship's database.
great. We have to double back.
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla, please respond.
go ahead.
we found Lieutenant Williams.
I'm afraid he's dead.
what happened?
um, he was attacked.
by who?
I don't know, but whatever it was, it tried to eat him.
you mean feed on him?
no. I mean eat him.
with teeth, like an animal.
what?
all right, uh...
radio back, try to get somebody to pick up the body.
in the meantime, we're going to have to figure out who the hell
Colonel.
hang on. We got something.
move back to our position.
sir?
in here.
another dead end.
well, this doesn't make any sense.
the signal's right on top of us.
is everybody okay?
Yeah. I think so.
what the hell is that?
a wraith soldier without the mask.
I didn't think they ever took those things off.
no feeding hand, rember?
how else is he going to eat?
Oh, great.
so now we have to contend with starving Wraith who are just learning to use their teeth?
this is my fault.
I'm the one that took away the only practical feeding mechanism they ever knew.
all right, look, I admit that it's a little disturbing, but it's not like they were man's best friend before.
this is just a different version of the same thing.
the question is, how did it get out?
well, the power fluctuations.
they must be more widespread than I thought.
so?
so, there must be a safety protocol of some kind.
when there's an interruption of the power, the pods shut downand automatically release their occupant.
but you stabilized it. Right?
I mean...All the other pods are fine?
they might be.
I'm...
I never actually figured outwhat was wrong, so...
is there any way to determine if any of the other pods have been compromised?
well, I don't know. Maybe.
I suppose we could go down and look.
I got a better idea.
let's get the hell out of here.
except I haven't finished sorting through the relevant data.
I mean, the IOA-- -the IOA can sue me. Let's go.
what?
I know this is the way, because we came by here this morning, but this looks different.
you're probably imaging it.
or not.
where the hell did that wall come from?
it wasn't there when we came in.
how's that possible?
I don't know!
we need to figure out another way out of here.
uh, okay...
it looks like if we go back the way we came a bit, we should be able to hook up with another corridor that loops around the other side of the Dart bay.
lead the way. -All right, well...
all right, this is it.
through here, about a hundred meters, and we are there.
Oh, my god.
Oh, this...This is not good.
you're telling me?
the Dart bay's on the other side of that.
this is the only way out of here.
to tell me how a giant hole magically appears in the middle of a ship?
actually, I have a theory about that.
you do?
look, these glitches we've been experiencing, they're not confined to power regulation.
they're in every major system.
I wouldn't call 'em "glitches." This is a major renovation.
I know, but think about it.
the wraith ships are basically organic, right?
I mean, they're capable of self-regeneration when they're damaged, but not just the hull.
the same systems regulate internal structure as well, so if those systems are malfunctioning along with the others...
you think the shipis repairing itself incorrectly?
not repairing so much as reconfiguring.
look, before he was killed, Williams said he saw the wall melt.
we've experienced it ourselves, I mean, dead ends popping upwhen there're supposed to be open corridors.
and this reconfiguration has completely cut us offfrom the dart bay?
from what I can tell, yes.
all right, get on the line to Atlantis.
tell 'em to send some jumpers and combat engineers.
we need to figure out how to get the hell outta here.
actually, I can't do that, because the communications systems are now completely offline.
look, what do you want me to do?
I mean, if I knew what causing this, I could do something about it, but these malfunctions are showing up everywhere.
I mean, they seem to be entirely random!
so we're stuck here?
for the time being, yes.
I do have an idea.
we revive Todd.
what?
he knows more about this ship than anyone.
maybe he can help me figure out what's wrong with it.
you do rember the last wraith that came out of one of those podsate one of our marines?
he was just a warrior drone.
look, we've long suspected that they spend the majority of their life under the controlling mental influence of the other wraith.
it's not surprising if you remove that influence they revert to an animal state.
but that shouldn't happen with Todd, theoretically.
Yeah, but you're forgetting one thing
I haven't found a cure for the disease that was killing them.
I mean, we take him out, and he might not last long.
well, that's the one thing I like about the plan.
Oh, great!
okay, so navigation's acting up.
look, whatever we decide, we got to do it quickly, because I cannot stay ahead of these malfunctions for much longer.
you sure about this?
how you feeling?
I did not think you would come.
what are friends for?
your ship is malfunctioning.
we need you to fix it.
you woke me for this?
that's right.
we've got work to do.
you know, I did...I tried that already.
okay, all right. You know what? You just go ahead.
somebody woke upon the wrong side of the pod this morning.
this makes no sense.
these systems are behaving erratically.
that's what I've been trying to tell you!
what have you done to them?
I didn't do anything!
they've been acting screwy since the moment we came on board!
nothing's responding the way it should.
it's almost as if...
what?
no, it's not possible.
what's not possible?
I believe I know why the ship is malfunctioning.
the disease is in the ship?
it is the only explanation that makes sense.
if you say so.
how is that even possible?
during the process of hibernation, there is a continuous exchange of fluid between wraith and hive.
the disease must have been transmitted in this manner.
great.
so we're flying around in a giant tumor.
with no way off.
as time goes on and the disease progresses, more and more systems will become affected
inertial dampeners, life support, hull integrity...
can we land it?
nding a hive is a tricky proposition in the best of circumstances.
under these conditions, I would not recommend it.
so, what do we do?
there is only one thing we can do.
we must cure this disease.
wait a second. I've barely scratched the surface on what went wrong here.
I mean, it could take months to analyze the data.
at the current level of the ship's degradation, I estimate we have four days before it becomes uninhabitable.
well, you better get to work.
how's it going, Rodney?
well, aside from the fact that every time I try to fix something, something else breaks, fine.
so we can expect more of these power fluctuations?
I think it's more than likely. Probably going to get worse.
then we've got a problem.
the other Wraith.
we can't afford to let them get out anymore.
well, I have been able to identify that safety protocol I was talking about.
I won't be able to override it completely, but I should be able to makea few key alterations.
yeah? Like what?
well, I mean, the simplest thing to do would be to make it so the pods don't release the wrait hwhen they shut down, but...
that would kill them.
basically suffocate them.
great. They're wraith.
Yeah, but are they?
I mean, they've taken the treatment, they no longer feed.
tell that to Lieutenant Williams.
what about Todd?
if significant numbers of his crew are killed, he will demand to know why.
tell him it's another malfunction.
do it.
all right.
you all right?
it will pass.
I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
I honestly thought the treatment would make things better for everyone.
what's funny?
I find it amusing, human apologizing to wraith.
that's because you don't understand compassion.
you just view it as a sign of weakness.
isn't it?
no, not by a long shot.
I'm not sure Colonel Sheppard would agree with you.
Colonel Sheppard's a soldier.
I'm a doctor.
Ah, yes.
his job is to take lives, and yours is to save them.
no, his job is also to save lives.
he's just has a different set of tools.
all right...
I've created a program to override the safety protocol.
you sure you want me to do this?
go ahead.
all right.
what is that?
it's one of the hibernation chambers.
it's not accepting the new commands.
no, it's no good.
I can't access it from here.
how many of them are in there?
well, it's one of the smaller auxiliary chambers, so a couple of dozen at the most.
all right, we're going to have to figure out another way to deal with these guys.
Colonel...
well, that's not a good sign.
let's move.
power fluctuations.
more of them could be out.
Oh, this is what I was afraid of.
we just figured out why you weren't able to access the last chamber.
what? What is it?
we're too late. The pods are opened.
how many got out?
all of them.
we're going to sweep through, starting from this position.
don't take any chances.
shoot anything that moves.
everyone clear?
all right, let's move out.
it says here you attempted to use iratus DNA in your treatment.
Yeah, I thought using the pure DNA of an iratus bug would help prevent the deterioration of your wraith abilities.
got the idea from Michael, if you can believe that, but, unfortunately, it didn't work, so...
what is it?
I have an idea.
Colonel Sheppard, come in, please?
this is Sheppard.
we need you to come down to the lab right away.
Todd needs to speak to you.
I'm a little busy right now.
can it wait?
apparently not.
meet up with Teyla and Ramirez till I get back.
what's so damn important?
he says there's a way to fix this.
fix what?
cure the disease?
not cure it, but undo it.
what are you talking about?
as you know, healthy wraith have an inherent ability to heal themselves of almost any ailment, but this has not always been the case.
hundreds of thousands of years ago, there was a treatment of last resort.
all right, spare me the history lessons.
a terminally ill wraith could occasionally restore himself to perfect health if he allowed an iratus "bug,
as you call them, specifically a queen, to feed on him.
and you're just bringing this up now?
the process was abandoned long ago because it is dangerous, almost always resulting in the death of the wraith in question.
I only consider it now because it would appear that we are...
beyond hope.
now, there is a planet less than three days' journey where we will find what we need.
McKay can barely keep this thing in orbit, and you want to take it into hyperspace?
Oh, I can manage it.
well, forget about it.
we're going to come up with a solution right here.
this is the only way to save my crew.
well, we're not leaving.
at least do me the courtesy of being honest.
this is not about not you not wanting to risk a jump to hyperspaceon a damaged ship.
you do not want me to go because I'll be restoring the lives of hundreds of unhealthy wraith, including myself.
well, I got to admit, that did cross my mind.
this disease is your responsibility.
if I had not agreed to meet with you to discuss this...
innovation of yours, my crew and I would not be in this predicament!
well, I might be feeling a little more charitable if you hadn't tried to kill half my people last time we decided to trust each other!
you owe me this, Sheppard.
I don't owe you anything.
get him out of here.
well, I guess I can't count on his help anymore.
what was that?
Sheppard, you're going to want to get up here.
keep working.
what the hell was that?
it looks like Todd's estimate of how long the ship's going to last is a little off.
what are you talking about? -You remember that hole we saw?
it's getting bigger. It's beginning to threaten the hull integrity, but that's not the biggest problem.
see that?
that is a line of structural weakness right across the width of the hive.
if there's an explosive decompression, this entire thing could be ripped in half.
this is Sheppard, all teams fall back.
fall back immediately.
we're not finished dealing with the wraith yet.
just leave 'em. The hull's failing. Get the hell out of there.
you heard the man. Let's move!
let's go! Let's go!
come on! Hurry up!
are you all right?
Yeah.
let's get the hell out of here.
what is it?
the door's jammed. Won't open.
Rodney, this is Teyla.
we are stuck behind a door that will not open.
can you help us?
look, the controls are malfunctioning.
I can't seem to override them.
just give me a minute.
we might not have a minute, Rodney.
crap.
Oh no.
uh, guys? You need to get out of there now.
you hear me? Get out of there now!
go, go, go!
go!
Sheppard! Come in! Please!
Yeah, we're here.
Oh, thank god.
I take it the bulkhead held?
Yeah, for now.
look, I was able to seal off the section so we won't depressurize, but you need to get down here
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
what now?
the force of the ship tearing itself apart, it's shifted our trajectory.
we're headed straight for the planet!
what's our status, Rodney?
I would say "screwed" is an apt description.
are we going to burn up?
no, we're going to survive re-entry.
in fact, it'll even slow us down a little, but nowhere near enough.
can you get us over the water?
land, water, at the speed we're traveling, we're going to be vaporized on impact.
we've got to do something.
like what? -Think!
I don't know-- okay, right.
forward maneuvering thrusters.
they should be unaffected.
but they're not getting any power because the propulsion conduits have been ripped in half.
I may be able to reroute power to them so they can slow our descent.
all right, now you're talking.
the only problem is I haven't a clue how to do it!
even if the systems weren't all malfunctioning, it would still take me a few hours to create that kind of work-around.
all right, just keep working on it.
where the hell are you going?
I'm going to go get some help.
get up. -You can't quite leave me be.
I don't have time to play games.
you know what that shaking is?
Oh, I can guess.
we've lost orbit.
we're entering the atmosphere, which means in a few minutes, we're going to slam into that planet.
a quick death will be a welcome reprieve.
I didn't think you were such a quitter.
look, you get this ship on the ground, I'll take you to your bug planet.
and you expect me to believe that?
my word.
and my crew?
they're dead.
the ship sheared in two.
we lost the entire rear section.
if we'd gone to the planet when I suggested it, none of this would have happened!
we would have never made it there, and you know it.
the hull was too badly damaged.
now, I understand you're pissed off about your crew, but we're about to join 'em unless somebody manages to slow us down, so are you going to help us out?
we're in the atmosphere.
altitude 100, 000 feet.
it is no use. I cannot control it.
move aside!
you sure about this?
what can he do? We're in a free fall.
I believe I can successfully create a bypass that will deliver power to the forward thrusters, but it will take a few moments.
Hey, you just take your time.
impact in 15 seconds.
not if I can help it.
firing thrusters!
40, 000 feet. Still descending too fast.
it's not enough!
instead of criticizing, perhaps you could work at getting me some more power!
I'm on it!
20, 000 feet and still too fast.
angle the thrusters. Try to get the ship level. We can fly her across the water.
trust me. I've done this before.
10, 000 feet.
that's it. That's all the power we've got.
2, 000 feet!
this is it! We're about to lose inertial dampeners!
they just hit the water.
I've got the coordinates.
relay them to the rescue jumpers immediately.
Colonel.
good to see you back on your feet.
how's the rest of your team?
you know, recovering.
we took quite a jolt when we hit the water.
I can imagine.
you were lucky.
by the time Major Kersey and his team were able to blast their way down to your position, the hive, what remained of it, was already half full of water.
it sank minutes after extracting you.
wish I was awake to see that.
how is he? -Not well.
he hasn't responded to any treatment.
I received your request.
And?
forgive me if i'm wrong, but weren't you the one who wanted to destroy his ship when it first appeared?
sounds vaguely familiar.
and now you want me to go against protocoland let him go.
well, he is the reason we're alive.
I realize that, Colonel.
he's also the reason you were in danger in the first place, not to mentionan incredible security risk.
all right, look, he's probably going to die anyway.
and if he survives?
if he survives, he's going to remember what we did.
like it or not, he's the best ally we've had in the fight against the wraith.
if we ever get around to perfecting this gene therapy, we're going to need his help to deploy it.
you realize this is the kind of decision that could cost me my job.
well, aren't they all?
I appreciate your decision to let me go.
a deal's a deal.
I will rember this, John Sheppard.
so, how long will you be gone?
quite a few days.
maybe a week.
couple of months, couple of years...
what, you don't like it here?
look at it. It's beautiful.
Thanks.
stop it. You sound like a broken record.
go on.
probable, probable...
starting to feel... Whoa! Oh!
Ooh.
come on.
hey? Hey?
DAWNIE?
DAWNIE?
Aaaahh! Oh! Shi... Dawn!
you're not coming back up.
but I'm a girl.
what's the secret password?
om
you comfortable? I will be.
Yeah, just a few days.
speak, baby, speak. Tell me I'm weak. Tell me these promises are not mine to keep. Tell me I'm ugly. But tell me you love me. Tell me you cannot go through this world without me. Oh, I, I, I'm just a tree. My roots. Are with her. But my leaves...
it's mine, mate.
come on. I'll put the kettle on.
heal, baby, heal. Take all the time you will. I never thought I'd say this. But I'm letting go of the bill. I don't wanna see. Your face here no more. Still that doesn't mean that I'm shutting the door. No, I, I, I'm just a tree. My leaves. Are with her. But my roots are buried well deep...
Nah, you're right.
good one, Peter. No problems. Good job, mate.
we might get going, mate.
I know these words. Are tearing you apart. Still, I told you. Right from the start. This is how our little song. Is gonna play out.
Hi. How you going, darling? It's me.
how's it going?
Uh-huh.
Oh, did you? Been a hell of a drive.
are you in town? Yeah.
I'm not far off now. Yeah.
do you know when you'll be home?
no, I was just... Hey.
I can't...
darling, I ca...can't hear you.
it's coming!
quick. It's coming.
keep your eyes open.
Simone!
what are you doing? Come here.
dad!
what are you thinking?
look, I told you a hundred times.
it's dangerous up there. You're not to go there alone, alright?
alright. I'm sorry.
huh? I'm sorry.
OK. I promise not to go back.
OK. Now, come on, it's late.
we gotta go home, alright?
it's not late. Yes, it is.
Megan, look. It's so cool, isn't it?
glows in the dark.
he's gonna give it to me for my birthday.
for your birthday. I promise.
how about now? Hey?
give it to me now. Please, please, please? Now, now, now.
please?
Hmm...
Mmmwah! Mmmwah!
there it is.
look. It's mine now.
come on, poppet. Come on, let's go.
Bye!
how's it going, Andy?
come on, Megs.
that's it. There we go.
Bye! Bye. See you later.
keep your head down, darling.
where you going?
dad. Dad!
dad! Dad!
dad! Dad!
mum!
what's happened? MUM!
dad's not moving! Dad?
dad!
what happened?
Peter?
Peter!
Peter! Get him out of the car.
dad! Peter!
mum, get him out of the car!
he's not breathing!
mum, calm down. Get him out of the car.
call an ambulance!
Oh!
Peter!
Peter!
mum!
I don't know what to do!
I'm so sorry. If there's anything I can do to help...
I'm here for ya.
you know I'm here to help ya?
alright. Look after your mum, mate. Alright?
Oh, look. Here's little Charlie.
and Lou, that's you, looking just like your dad when he was your age.
no-one's crying.
that's how it is when people are really sad.
people are leaving. They want to say goodbye.
I can't.
Ah! Wait up!
Tim, get the phone, please!
Tim!
Simone, you get that!
Charlie, get the phone!
you've reached the home of Tim, Lou, Simone, Charlie, Dawn and Petei, which is more than they have.
please leave a message we'll be happy to find it when we get in.
mum.
mum, get up.
it's 11 o'clock.
uncle Jack's just called and he wants to know if you got the money.
he wants you to call him back.
mum!
haven't you got school?
it's a Saturday.
and anyway, you promised we'd go today.
where?
you promised.
HARRISVILLE CEMETERY
I can't believe this.
they still haven't engraved his name.
it's been two months.
stupid undertakers.
what do you expect?
well, if no-one checks...
dad's grave's pathetic.
just shut up.
Simone, Lou, Charlie!
dinner's ready!
mum, can you go and get your kids? It's ready.
Charlie, go to the kitchen. Dinner's ready.
do you know where Simone is?
Simone!
Simone, it's dangerous! Come down!
Simone, you're too high!
what the hell were you doing up there?
nothing.
think I'm stupid? You're looking for attention.
and you? Why'd you cut off your hair?
not for attention?
just leave me alone.
someone needs to go shopping. What do we need?
I'll go to the supermarket.
yeah? When?
tomorrow, or maybe today.
although today I have to bring Simone to the ophthalmologist, so maybe tomorrow.
Yeah. One of these days.
right.
Charlie! Come and have something to eat.
come here so I can dress you.
Mmm. Everyone will be late for school.
I can't leave you here alone.
look, I'm exhausted.
I'm going to get really, really angry.
be a good boy, or Mummy's going to get very, very cross.
just put it on!
you two, move it!
Lou, clear the table!
what do you think I am? The maid?
Simone, go and get dressed.
there's a good girl.
after yesterday's performance...
I don't feel well.
I've got a tummy ache.
if you all carry on like this,
I'll leave without you.
I mean it.
it's nothing to worry about.
Hello, Charlie. How are you?
having the meeting here today, dear.
did you forget? No. No, of course not.
I'm just running a bit late.
you better go by bike.
I'll keep the young ones at home. No worries.
and I hope you've been keeping a list of all your serial numbers.
what is it?
the engraver.
dawn, really.
we spoke about this last meeting.
you engrave your name on your TV and stereo, anything you think they might try and sell.
Yeah, I'll have to get onto that.
well, there's no real rush.
but, Vonnie, there is!
haven't you noticed those boys riding their bikes up and down the road lately?
biscuit? Yes, please. Love one.
Oh, I'll make the tea, Dawn.
um...I'm sorry. I'm exhausted.
make yourselves at home.
dad?
mum.
mum.
what?
I know where Dad is.
have you been having a nightmare?
I heard him.
a ghost, you mean?
no. Not a ghost. For real.
you can talk to him. Want me to show you?
now? In the middle of the night? See you tomorrow, darling.
come on. Now!
stop it. Please.
you're imagining things.
mum, I cross my heart, swear to die.
come and lie down with me.
you never believe me.
alright. OK.
come on, show me.
come on.
follow me.
Simone, really, what is this? Shh.
come on.
wait, wait, stop, stop. Come down. It's too dangerous.
I need to go there by myself.
so? Go on. Higher.
mum?
mum?
did you hear him? Maybe.
told you. I heard something but...
it's our secret.
the two of us. Promise? Please?
I promise. I promise.
cross my heart, swear to die.
now get back to bed.
soon the boys can wear them.
then we're not going to throw them out, we'll just put them away.
clear them away.
you know what you should do?
you should make a list of everything that was wrong with him.
I mean, he wasn't Mr Perfect, was he?
well...
to me, he was.
no, he wasn't. Remember?
he had to say everything three times. He could be boring.
and he had hairs growing out of his nose.
and between me and you, was he always that great in...?
good in bed? You can't imagine.
bastard.
more than 85 bushfires are still burning in New South Wales tonight.
fires at South West Rocks and Crescent Head on the state's north coast have forced evacuations.
so fan no property has been lost. Yuck!
he sneaks the whisky from the sideboard.
thinks Mum won't notice it.
it's Dad's whisky.
he doesn't need it anymore.
you selfish idiot.
Hey, turn it back on!
who do you think you are?
Hi. You've reached the O'Neill home, which is more than we have, unless we're out in the garden.
feel free to express your inner most feelings after the tone.
Thanks. Bye.
Hey. Hey.
how you going, mate? Good. How are you?
how you been? Oh, great. Great.
how's your mum?
Yeah, she's good. Everyone's good.
um...
I was wondering if maybe I could have a part-time job around the yard?
course you can. Hey, the old man would be proud of you, mate. Hey?
look, I'll need to think about it.
what are you thinking weekends? After school?
I...I don't know.
I'll have to talk to Mum.
thanks anyway, mate.
alright, mate. No worries.
look after yourself, hey? Alright.
see you, mate. Sorry for having disturbed you.
you didn't.
Charlie's still not speaking.
mum doesn't seem to care.
she spoils him.
that's no reason. Anyway, you can see more than I can.
you don't need me telling you all this.
me too.
I really hate maths.
did you like maths?
so it runs in the family.
then why is Tim so good at maths?
so, you're 15. What's it like?
I've got three boyfriends.
still top of the class, which is kind of boring.
I sneak out of the house at night to meet up with one of my boyfriends.
and we go off to Brisbane in his new convertible and go to a club.
your go.
well...
I'm 18, I leave Australia to go to France.
I live with my mum's family.
Oh, no. Don't go.
it's really great there. I work in a bar.
someone asks me my name.
how come you don't seem sad anymore?
I couldn't live without my dad.
well, you have a choice to be happy or sad.
and I chose to be happy.
and I am happy.
that's disgusting.
that's really, really disgusting.
mum! Mum!
no matter how much we flush, they keep coming back.
what's that? Why is it doing that?
I better call Uncle Jack.
why Uncle Jack?
mum, he lives 1, 350km away.
I don't think he's going to come all this way just to see some frogs.
you think you can fix it?
I'm not a bloody plumber.
you've come in about the job, then? What?
I saw you looking at the sign.
Oh. Well...have you found anyone?
I've only just put up the notice. Have you done much bookkeeping?
sales work?
I've never really had a job before.
my husband earned enough money for both of us.
you divorced, then? No. He died.
I'm sorry to hear that.
eight months ago.
well, there's really not that much to it.
I need someone here when I'm out on a job, take bookings, maybe put away the stock, talk to the customers about the bathrooms.
doesn't seem that difficult. You wanna give it a go, then?
Yeah, sure.
George. Dawn.
Hello, Dawn.
Ah, so when do you want me to start?
tomorrow? 9: 30?
OK.
don't you wanna know what the pay is?
Oh, yeah, sure.
$400 a week.
great.
OK.
Bye. See you tomorrow. Yep.
Oh, by the way, you wouldn't happen to know a good plumber?
I don't know about a good one but plumber, for sure.
what do you think they mean?
looks like you've got tree roots blocking your drains.
I know people who built their house around a tree.
I wouldn't recommend it. Plumbers nightmare.
how was your test? Yeah, it was alright.
it's that Moreton Bay fig!
they have the most awful roots.
the council ought to ban them.
and look, it's pushing up my fence again.
I've already had it repaired three times.
it's not his fault.
could be your mango.
it is not my mango.
it's a beauty. Bit of a headache, though.
the drought's driving the roots down in search of moisture.
should we be watering it, then?
no, it needs too much.
and it's banned at the moment. Mmm.
there's water restrictions. Yeah. Yeah, I know.
mum! No, you're too heavy.
OK. Just this once. OK, dinner, everyone!
I'm working tomorrow. Got to get up early.
Hello?
Hello?
it's all toilets and sinks.
vonnie says that the 10 years she's been working there are the happiest she's ever been.
I'm sure she's just saying that to cheer me up.
I don't think I can...
I can't leave Simone, hang around here all day long.
it's not good for her.
dawn! What in heaven's name are you doing?
I, um...
there's a cat that keeps climbing up and down the tree, and...it makes an awful racket.
I can't get to sleep.
or maybe it's rats or possums.
go to bed, Dawn.
you must be exhausted!
what would it be?
what?
I can't hear you against the wind.
what? What?
cool.
you know what?
I don't really like school.
let's see.
I'm 38.
my husband's dead.
I cry day and night.
don't eat anything. I smoke a lot.
let's play a different game.
how about we tell each other secrets, OK?
OK.
my dad talks to me in the tree and I go up there every day.
to listen to him...speak.
it's the best feeling I've had.
I thought people came back as animals, not plants.
mine was really, really true.
you just made yours up on the spot, didn't you?
no.
I swear.
Oh, yeah. You believe in fairytales?
how big is a person's soul?
bet you don't know.
do so.
that's impressive.
can you do it again?
I spent a lot of time waiting for my father in pub lounges.
like a drink, did he?
he was a salesman.
travelled all around.
my mother left us. She went back to France.
although, funnily enough, my father was French.
my mother's English. Well, Scottish, actually.
anyway, so he brought me up and, um...I followed him around and we ended up here when I was 17.
and that's how I met my husband.
in a pub.
love at first sight, was it?
no, not really.
I think I was just fed up waiting for my dad.
I thought life would start when I got married.
and, um...gradually,
I realised I'd found a man that was just right for me.
and we were happy for a very long time.
you're lucky you've got your kids.
Yeah, I know.
I can't remember what life was before them.
and I can't imagine life without them.
but I'm rambling. What about you?
are you married? Do you have children?
well...
everything OK?
I saw my neighbour.
Oh, she'd love to tell everyone how much fun I'm having, with my children alone at home.
you having fun, then?
got a dollar?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oooh.
not bad. My turn.
hit the punch ball!
I'm alright.
want another punch?
where were you?
you with the police? Go on answer.
we called your work. No-one was there.
we tried calling your mobile. It was off.
if something happened to us, what were we supposed to do?
well, nothing did happen, right?
I was at the pub.
Oh, really? With who?
no-one.
no-one.
shut up, Charlie.
what's wrong?
nothing.
what did you do to him?
nothing. I think he, um...just woke up from a nightmare or something.
you can come and sleep with me if you want.
can I come too?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
holy shit! Bloody brilliant!
what have you done?
what? Nothing!
Oh, really?
what's going on in that head of yours?
it...it's a dead branch.
you're doing it on purpose.
why can't you just understand?!
it's OK, Tim.
I'll do it. Go to bed.
Christ.
you never said it was this bad.
well, the trouble is at night when the wind is up.
when did it happen?
friday night.
and you've been sleeping with it there?
well...I got used to it.
you're lucky you weren't killed.
Oh, I don't think it meant to hurt me.
it's only a tree, Dawn.
well, I know that.
I know I have to do something about it, but I just don't know where to start.
are you kidding?
OK, Tim. Start it up!
take it easy.
Hey! Slowly.
slowly.
whoa. Yeah.
Yep.
that's it.
almost. Good, good, good.
Yeah! Give it a little more.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow. A little more.
Yup. Little more.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's it. That's good.
got it.
there.
everything OK?
not too serious, I hope.
you're a tough one.
don't mind a bit of pain, do ya?
so tell me how old are you?
eight.
show us, hey?
whoa.
look at that.
you've grown that much in a year.
that much?!
my God, you're growing too fast, darling.
my little girl.
got a pen so we can mark it?
so beautiful.
amazing.
thank you.
you lived here long? Yeah. Very long.
15 years.
you're lucky.
I, uh... I better go.
that tarp should be fine for the time being, anyway.
OK.
Yeah, it will be a problem.
I think it could be tree... Yes.
9. 2 metres. Over 9 metres?
9. 2 metres? That's a big root, isn't it?
it's a big root, that's for sure.
and imagine they'd be all around here, they'd be going.
come down and look down here. Come on.
and then round there, it gets even worse.
I can tell you it's practically an obstacle course.
what's all this about? You might have knocked.
well, we were going to.
no, you weren't.
you were nosing around.
my apologies, madam.
we didn't know anyone was home.
well, if you'd have knocked, you'd have found out.
well, it's not your laundry being affected, is it?
pretty soon it'll be all our drains and if the sewers back up, then it'll be a public health risk.
Oh, since when have you cared about public health?
since you proved incapable of minding your own garden.
I won't have you telling me what to do in my own property.
look, I'm going right up to the mayor and, um, my cousin is a personal friend of his.
well, no-one is going to make me chop this tree down.
it's mine.
Mrs O'Neill's right, you know.
surely there must be a way of coming to some friendly agreement, though?
Oh, brilliant.
then we'll all be back here in another six months.
it's not a tree. It's an octopus!
call this a bloody holiday?
what's it called?
go on, say it.
chocolate.
come on, talk. Speak.
or you won't get any.
and say please too.
ma!
Charlie, what is it?
come in here and see me, darling.
he won't leave me alone.
mum always lets him have his own way.
he is her favourite.
I thought Tim was.
no. It's Charlie. Tim was Dad's favourite.
no. I was.
why did Mum decide on her own?
what if I didn't want to go in his crappy caravan?
are they in love or what? That's her business.
can I stay here with you?
as if I'd want you hanging about.
you're so bloody mean.
what if you don't pass your test?
whether I pass my exams or not doesn't matter.
I'm outta here.
did you seriously think that
I was going to sit around and watch your tree grow for the rest of my life?
he wasn't just your dad.
you're not the only one.
now piss off.
and give this to Mum.
what is it? Just give it to her.
and none of your business.
so how's Tim getting down?
er, well, it depends whether George comes or not.
What?! You mean we have to spend the whole of Christmas with him?
maybe. I...I don't know.
mum! Simone!
Simone, stop!
Simone, don't move!
Simone!
Simone!
come back!
it's his caravan! He lent it to us.
we can't tell him not to come.
Yes, we can!
OK. Well, I'll call him as soon as we get there.
call him now!
I doubt we're in range. Try.
this is George.
hello. It's his answering machine.
leave a message.
Hi.
Hi, George. It's...it's Dawn.
um...
listen, I need to talk to you. Um...
there might be a problem about Christmas.
I'll explain.
OK, see you.
OK. Back in.
mum!
mum!
mum!
move.
stop it.
bend with me sway with ease. When we dance you have a way with me...
mum. Yes?
I'm hungry. Have an apple.
other dancers may be on the floor. Deal, but my eyes will see only you. Only you have that magic technique. When we sway I go weak...
you're so wet. Do you like it?
I do.
make me thrill as only you know how. Sway me smooth, sway me now.
I passed! What?
Congratulations! Well done.
Charlie. How are you, mate? You alright?
Oh, great marks too.
Tim, give us a hand, mate.
well done.
look. He passed. Cool!
so does that mean that he's moving to Sydney?
well, I guess so. You alright with that?
thursday child has far to go as they say.
you like it? It's wonderful. Yeah.
who wants to come for a swim? I will.
race you there.
Hey, look at you all tanned.
paste. Yeah. Do you put any of this?
well, we could. That's a little bit hot.
for the kids I've got the sweet one.
add just a little bit of that.
careful, it's hot.
anyone brave enough to try one of these?
I will. That's the man.
is it good? Yeah.
I brought a friend over for Christmas.
Oh, my God. Let's have it.
it's our first Christmas without Dad.
and you don't care!
angel, just...
just because I'm having a nice time doesn't mean I've forgotten your dad.
we're all sad. Even Charlie, who doesn't speak.
deep inside, I know he's as upset as we are.
but I'm certain that
dad wants us to enjoy ourselves.
and we're going to miss him for as long as we live but we're going to have to learn to live with that.
no.
are you gonna tell me?
hmm?
what's that? I Will.
Uh-huh. I Will!
Mmm.
they can't see us.
and we'll hear them if they come.
no, we won't. Yeah, we will.
shit.
it's everywhere.
dawn.
Oh, my God.
it's too dangerous. There's a limit.
a limit to what? The love of nature.
I've had enough.
it's gotta come down, that's all.
never.
I can take care of it.
OK. Yep.
I'll call you tomorrow. Alright.
ready.
Oh, cool! Where did you find him?
down the road. There's another one.
cool. Let's go check.
Simone?
Simone, dinner's ready. Come on down.
no. Never.
we can't go on like this.
Tim!
please, go up and get her.
why do I have to do the dirty work?
Simone, come down!
listen, Simone... Dream on.
um, Simone, we've had enough of this tree thing.
I'm not coming down!
I've got work tomorrow and I need to get to bed.
I'm staying here till I know for sure they won't hurt it.
how old are you?
you're needed amongst the living. And the dead.
no.
leave her be. Ladyship's bound to come down eventually.
I'll be there in a minute.
you shithead! You bloody shithead. I hate you!
what do you reckon? It'll take us a day.
I'll start at the top. We'll go branch by branch.
there's no other way we can do it. We'll definitely need the winch.
alright.
morning. Hi.
Simone. You've gotta be reasonable now.
come on, love. You got no choice.
George.
Simone! Simone!
dawn!
if you come up here, I'll jump.
careful! She could easily do it!
George, stop.
Hey, Simone.
Hey, listen to me.
it's a great place to play. I understand that. I do.
but can't you see it's destroying the house?
your mum needs your help.
please, let's just be reasonable about this.
come down, George!
George, come down! Simone.
Hey. Hey, look at me. What is it with the tree?
come on, sweetheart, you can tell me.
dammit, Simone. What's wrong with you?
look, you can't have everything your own way.
come down, George! Enough, now!
gotta get her under control. Can't believe it.
she's eight years old. You can't let her get away with this.
just forget about the whole thing.
what are you hoping for, Dawn? A fucking miracle?
thank you, guys. I'm sorry.
tell me how much I owe you for coming out.
you know what this means?
Oh, yes, I do. Yeah.
bye now. Thanks.
I don't understand you.
you're not happy, I know.
but you're not the first person this has ever happened to, alright?
get a life, for God's sake.
it's like you enjoy all this.
that must be it, I guess.
just do me a favour don't ever come back.
dawn, listen... Just piss off!
that's it, love. They're gone.
it's over.
speak to me.
along the Gold Coast's open beaches, the swell was 3 metres and bigger in the sets.
offshore, waves as big as 4 metres were recorded, 4. 8 off Tweed Heads.
some beaches were affected by erosion.
all were closed.
but every cyclone has a silver lining.
but you're not leaving tomorrow.
are you in such a hurry to leave?
mum, can you stop messing with all my things?
Thanks, Mum, but...
I'm doing stuff right now.
would you say...we're a happy family?
what do you want me to say?
just the truth will do.
what does it matter?
happy families are boring, anyway.
mum.
evacuation kit.
canned food, can opener, containers filled with clean drinking water.
do we have any spare batteries?
I'm surprised we even found a torch that works.
don't worry. I think it will blow itself out.
how do you know?
at least we'll all die together.
I don't wanna die.
Oh, wow, you're talking!
well done, Charlie! That's great!
that took long enough! Finally!
everyone in its own good time.
good on you, Charlie.
I'm proud of you. Well done.
close your eyes.
it's OK.
george called. He thinks we should leave now.
mum, I'm...I'm scared.
come here.
come here.
careful!
you said it would blow itself out!
Oh, my God! Come on!
come on! Mum!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
come on, move!
quick! Quick!
Tim! Tim!
Tim, we've got to get to the school.
shit!
it's too late! We have to get under the house.
come on!
keep coming!
mum, Mum.
where is Simone?
Simone!
Simone! Simone!
Simone!
Simone!
Simone! Simone!
where are you?!
Simone! Come with me!
angel!
come down!
10? That's all?
Yeah.
you can have that one.
can I have one?
don't squash 'em!
there might be some at the top.
and maybe down there.
try now!
Hey, not too much.
just pat it down.
Hi.
everyone alright? Yeah.
we're OK.
sorry about your house.
Yeah. It was a great house.
where are you gonna live?
Oh, well, I don't really care.
um...I thought I'd find a tent or something.
you can come and pitch it in my backyard.
we'll be alright.
will I see you again?
who knows? Maybe.
life is long, right?
see you. See you.
there is a house built out of stone. Wooden floors, walls and windowsills. Tables and chairs worn by all the dust. This is a place that I don't feel alone. This is a place that I call my home. And I. Built. A home. For you. For me. Until. It disappeared. From me. J' From you, oh. And now. It's time. To leave. And turn. To dust. Out in the garden. Where we planted the seed. There is a tree as old as me. By the cracks of its skin. I climbed to the top. I climbed the tree to see the world. When the gusts of wind came to blow me down. I held on as tightly as you held on to me. Held on as tightly as you held on to me. And I. Built. A home. For you. For me. Until. It disappeared. From you. Oh, from me. And now. It's time. To leave. And turn. To dust.
I don't like it.
what's not to like?
the ceiling's too low, fridge is too small, and there's no bath.
you haven't even checked the bath. You can sense a bath.
10 bucks? Yeah.
grab us a beer, will you, Dean?
I'll get you a beer 'cause I'm getting one. Knock yourself out.
six months. Long time. Cheers.
eh, Sammy? I guess.
it's not natural, is it?
I'm gonna wash up.
Yeah, you're right, Harry. There's no bath. Harry,
it's a gift.
think he's OK?
who knows?
he seems fine.
think he's fine? Who knows?
well, should we talk to him about it or something?
who fucking knows, Dean?
well, Sam's out of his hands now.
hear Glenn got transferred?
Yeah.
hmas 'Dignity'.
Yep.
someone snitched on him. Thank Christ.
firstly, Glenn Carter is executive officer.
secondly, Glenn Carter was just...
glenn Carter is a walking fucking power trip and you know it, Dean.
glenn can be a prick. Glenn is a prick.
he was well within his rights. You defend that motherfucker once...
we all went through it. We didn't go through that.
alright.
what am I talking to you for? It was probably your idea.
watch it. Or what?
I mean it, Harry. You've got a taste for it now?
shut the fuck up! Hey.
I was following orders. Thank you, Dr Goebbels.
glenn was just doing exactly what... Glenn, please, no.
stop calling him Glenn around me.
you would have done exactly the same thing if you'd been made XO.
maybe you would, Dean. Sam needed shaping up.
you even said that yourself. Not like that!
glenn probably thinks that's how you treat a screw-up.
then he's a fucking sadist.
watch the hat.
what are you doing?
letting my fingers...
...do...
Bingo!
tell me you're not. I'm ordering it for later.
it'?
Christ, Harry!
Oh, what, you got some kind of moral stance now, have you?
it'll do him good.
do him good? He's a bloody handsome guy.
he doesn't need... Hi.
who am I speaking to, please?
Debbie. Hey, Debbie.
guessing that's not your real name, but let's roll with it anyway. Hey.
um, just want to inquire about your service.
that sounds exactly like what I'm after.
um... How much?
OK.
Yep. Uh, Novotel, Darling Harbour.
room 522.
Sam Fisher.
do you need the... No?
OK.
Yep.
Yep. No worries. OK. 'Bye.
she's gonna call me back.
you shouldn't have used his name.
you are so paranoid!
so why didn't you use your own name? What's in a name?
don't.
Debbie? debbie?
Oh, OK.
250 for the hour?
well, that's very reasonable.
well, how much is the taxi?
what, so that could be up to 300?
no, no, let's not haggle. We're having such a nice time.
um... OK.
no, they all sound lovely.
Yep.
no, this is for a, uh...
this is for a very special guy, Debs.
she needs to be...
Yeah, she needs to be, you know, lovely, but nice.
simple.
not like retarded simple, just...
he's not into mentals or anything. Just...
well, uncomplicated.
sweet and gentle. That sounds perfect.
lock her in. That's great.
Oh, bugger it. Let's get one for me as well.
you've talked me into it, Debs.
so two girls? Yeah, just two girls. That'd be great.
so that's, like, 600?
Oh, look...
just... oh... Throw me something skanky.
you know? Just... something off the rack.
mileage on the clock.
you know.
little older.
nothing I have to impress.
you know what I mean? Yep.
OK.
uh... No, what time is it now?
alright, let's go... OK, midnight. Let's go midnight. Yep.
OK. Deb.
Yeah.
I have to interrupt you there, OK? Yep, Deb.
I've got to... Cool. Midnight.
thank you very much.
OK. Adios.
that is a load off.
well, Sally definitely can't come here now.
well, that's a side benefit.
you're an arsehole! Who called?
uh, Glenn Carter he wanted to make sure you cleaned the dunny before you got ahead of yourself.
see, he's fine.
you're fine, aren't you?
you're great.
you're through the worst of it now, mate.
just...
look, can we just have some fun now, or what?
Hey, Deano, you're welcome to bring Sally here if you want.
me and Harry, we could just go to the bar, whatever.
Thanks, Sammy.
you done in there, Sam?
I'm about to bust that fucking porcelain.
Oh! It's Royal Doulton.
turn on the television and open the window, lads.
this is gonna be big.
been on the town.
go on, Sammy. Come on.
go on! Go on! Alright.
I can't do moves. I can't do moves.
fuck!
What'd you do?
look at you. Look at you. Ooh!
you're beautiful. Beautiful.
Thanks. You are. I mean...
can't go wrong.
Oh, you almost picked up there.
what a dog.
I'll give you a head start.
Oh, and he takes it!
Hi. How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
what are you up to? Oh, you know.
looking for somewhere to drink. I was drinking over there.
I'm now heading back to my hotel. Your hotel? Where are you staying?
the dirty, stinking one up the road. Oh, really?
what room number? Can't remember.
Oh, you can!
Dean! You can. What room number?
no, it's not... No. It's not glamorous. It's not glamorous.
Yeah, well, what room number? Um, 3... 1... 4.
that is so... I'm gonna be knocking on the wrong door.
no. I'm gonna be...
what's your name? Sue.
Harry. Lovely to meet you. Hi, Harry.
you're gorgeous. You're beautiful.
see ya. 314, yeah?
OK. OK.
room 314.
mum.
mum, it's me. Turn down the Cilla Black.
Yeah, and I love you too.
Oh, Mum, come on.
mum, don't cry. Come on.
I got promoted.
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm an officer now.
not a gentleman. Very funny.
nothing. I miss you too.
how's Pop?
Really?
I'm sure it'll be fine.
mum, I... Can you stop crying for a sec? Mum?
mum, they're sending us over there.
in the morning, first thing.
I don't... I really don't know, Mum. They don't...
they don't tell us that stuff until we're actual...
no, Mum, you can't tell...
mum, you can't tell anyone. I'm not even supposed...
for Christ... goodness sake, don't tell Pop. OK?
mum, just...
mum, I need you to listen just for one sec.
I'm not going.
I'm not going back.
no, you... you don't understand, Mum. They almost killed me out there.
no. No, I've decided.
I guess not.
alright, well, you know what?
I'm... I'm sorry I'm such a fucking embarrassment.
you should absolutely talk to her.
he talked to her already. When he ordered, he talked to her.
she's out of his league, man. Talk to her properly.
sorry, Sammy, but look at her. Exactly. Look her in the eye.
don't do it. And tell the truth.
Sammy! Sam. He's trying to embarrass you.
shouldn't you be in the honeymoon suite?
isn't that why we evacuated the fucking room?
they just texted, by the way. They're stuck in traffic.
they're probably avoiding you. "They"?
I told you, her parents are coming.
you're bringing your girlfriend's parents to our hotel?
fiancee's. No, we're all going out to dinner.
with her fucking parents. Fiancee's.
I can't guarantee what state I'm gonna be in.
come on, guys. I want her to meet you.
jeez, how are we gonna eat more food?
we have to go to dinner with his girlfriend's fucking parents.
fiancee's. You know, her old man.
some people like their parents, Harry.
don't do it, Sammy.
let rip, Sammy. Let rip.
excuse... excuse me, ma'am. Yes?
could, um...
could we have some water, please? Sure.
wise move, mate.
go fire a fucking cannon or something, Dean.
look, mate, I don't want to do this. No, you do want to do this.
you want to do this. Believe me, you want to do this.
you're never gonna see this girl again.
you're never gonna see her again. Here she comes.
thank you.
beautiful meal. Ta.
anything else? Yeah.
I, um... I just... I just wanted to tell you something.
sure.
you are the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
truly, truly. The way you move, the poise, the whole, um...
I... I was... You know, I was gonna say aura, but I don't even...
OK. You know. OK.
Hey, look, this... this isn't a pick-up.
look, I'm actually gonna pay the bill and I'm gonna go.
Emma, what are you doing? Uh...
wiping tables. Look after everybody else.
leave the boys alone. Stop flirting. We've got customers.
I couldn't leave without telling you that you absolutely devastated me the second I saw you.
and... you've made my night.
Thanks.
what in blue Jesus was that?
no, that was good. 'Devastated' was an odd call.
you just made a fool out of her. He didn't.
she thought he was pulling the piss. No, she didn't.
I wasn't. Yeah, but she doesn't know that.
Hey, Shakespeare. Yeah.
my cousin has a friendly poker game round the back if you guys want to play.
some of my friends are coming down too, so...
a... bonus. That sounds like a winner. I'm Sam.
Emma. This is Harry and this is Dean.
we can't actually stay, ma'am. We're running late.
ignore him. Call your friends. We're staying.
sure. Well, the game's straight through the kitchen, boys.
awesome. Alright.
sit the fuck down. Sit the fuck down. McCabe.
come on. Leiberman, move.
we're not staying long. Oh, we're staying long.
Hi. Hi. I'm Harry.
straight through the back, boys. Thanks. This is my friend Dean.
straight through the back. How you doing, pal?
great rooftop.
Yeah, you get over it after a while.
have you worked here long?
if I gave you three questions, is that what you'd ask me?
Yep.
OK, since I was 12.
I live with the Italian boys downstairs that your friends are playing poker with.
they're very protective, so you'd better play your cards right.
Yeah, no, I'm kind of hoping that my friends are playing their cards right.
pretty good.
that was my boob. Was it?
Yep.
OK, second question. Where are your parents?
they live in England.
my dad's a pilot.
why didn't you go with them? Fuck living in England.
I've never been.
OK, I'll give you another question, 'cause the first one...
it's kind of like backyard cricket. You got out for a golden duck.
alright.
so how long have you been on the ship for?
for six months. No sex for six months?
that's a bit of a personal question, isn't it?
I'm an open kind of person to questions like that.
six months. No, um...
no sex.
what's your favourite position?
on top, 'cause there's more con... I like to be in control.
Yeah, right. You?
um... Behind for sailors, wouldn't it be?
Oh, come on.
no, I like to definitely be on the bottom.
yeah? Yeah.
what's the most unusual place you've ever had sex?
hopefully, not on the ship.
that means you'd swing both sides. Probably...
in my mum's bed, I would say. Not with my mum, though.
Yeah. I hope not. Yeah.
OK, my first question. That wasn't counted. That was a warm-up.
well, how long, um... When do you ship out?
tomorrow morning.
but I'm... I'm... I'm not.
so you're stationed here?
Nah, I'm just, um...
I'm not going.
you were meant to say, "At first light.
and then I say, "Well, let's not waste time.
I'm not a... I'm not a coward. Who said you were a coward?
no, I know. I'm just saying that I'm...
I'm saying I'm not...OK, well, my third question.
if you're not such a coward, why haven't you made a move?
alright, uh... I'm gonna take my third question.
you don't have another question. I do. I had the cricket duck thing.
do you want me to make a move?
um, what are four things you don't like in life?
heights. I don't like...
no, no, fuck off. Don't do... Don't do that. Don't do that.
sorry. Sorry.
um... Sharks. But you're on a boat.
Yeah, I know. I'm on the boat. I'm not in the water with...
don't you go fishing? You ever caught a shark?
no, I've never caught a sh...
uh... spiders and...
this... this question, to be honest, I really don't know what to say.
OK. What about you?
uh, chocolate cake. Overrated.
you don't like chocolate... No. Not at all.
everyone likes chocolate cake. Yeah, no, not me.
um, flowers. They're already dead when someone gives them to you.
just a boring present. Like, I'd rather get something than flowers.
olives. Alright.
acquired taste. Alright. Well, I won't get you...
I won't get you, what, chocolate cake, flowers and, um, olives.
and...
...weddings.
and I'll never propose to you. There you go.
don't fucking do that.
don't. Seriously.
sorry.
it's alright. So you definitely won't propose now.
no, I'm not.
so, what's this? What?
this. Like... like, what?
like, that. What, do you take all guys up here?
what do you think I do, bring guys here and...
...Sit on top of them or something?
on top of them?
is that what? Have you taken me up here to?
fat chance. Alright.
Oh, that's a shame.
Oh, game over.
the food was great, by the way.
it was awesome.
that final truffle was just like... when you think...
it's about layers. Should see the food we eat on the fucking ship.
it was delicious food. We call it scran.
shit cooked by the Royal Australian Navy.
come on, Lady Luck. Yeah.
OK.
it's alright. I'll lick it up.
four for me, thanks, John. Ahh!
here you go.
I'm fine.
you want no cards? I'm fine.
you want to keep going?
put 50 on this hand. Yeah.
Oh! You put this in?
OK.
hang on. I've got two fives.
what have you got? You can't. You've got to go in.
let's see what you've got. Oh, OK.
motherfucker. Fucking...
does that mean that's all mine? Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.
first time I saw Harry do this, I was like, "It's full-on.
mate, all we do out there is play cards.
is that right? Yeah.
cause your mate looks like he doesn't know what he's doing.
I just watch. I'm like the mascot.
pour myself one first. Oh, no, dickhead.
no, you pour everyone else first, then you pour yourself.
shut up, dickhead. When you deal cards it's the same thing.
you deal everyone else and then you deal yourself last.
you pour everyone...Go and deal your mum one, alright?
I'm not touching this one.
I'm growing a beard. Um...
um... You have to ask for permission to grow a beard.
and, um...Yep?
Yeah, you go to the CO - the commanding officer
and you say, "Can I grow a beard?
and they give you two weeks. You stop shaving.
and then two weeks later, you go to the CO and, uh...
they say, "Can you shave that scraggly shit off your face, mate?
Absolutely. Yeah. So...
Yeah, well, I actually just asked permission two days ago just so I could have the shadow for the chicks.
I'm gonna shave tomorrow.
I want a break. Top call.
I'm happy to push on through. I'm not. Drink up.
are you trying to get me drunk?
Occifer, I didn't mean it.
who's dealing?
you can handle another one? We're having a break, dickhead.
you shut up, dickhead. No, no, no, that's fine.
you can talk to me, alright?
pathetic. Ooh, burns the lips.
Oh, beautiful.
it's good stuff - the best. That went down pretty easy?
can I pinch one of them?
when you're done?
sure.
here you go, mate.
what about your other mate? He doesn't like poker?
Sam? Nah, hates it. No, he can't stand it.
his mum's a gambling addict, actually.
not cards. Yeah, like... betting on the football, whatever.
yeah? It's tragic.
do not talk about gambling around Sam.
fair enough.
someone say there were some girls coming or something...
not that I'm... I'm engaged, actually.
not that stops anyone.
but... Yeah, I'm not being...
why are you so jumpy, mate? He's late.
he's late for a very important date.
ship's comedian, this one.
grab some coffee, Dean. Hello, boys.
Hey! Ladies!
how are you?
Esther and Kristy, this is Dean and Harry.
Kristy? Esther? Kristy.
kristy. Esther.
Esther! Hello, Esther. Aren't you meant to stand up for us?
sorry. You're right. We are. Pleased to meet you, boys.
do you want to sit down? It's alright. I'll sit on your lap.
so where's Emma? Is that your hat?
you're not... Where's Emma?
...Attached to any of these... Esther, where's Emma?
illegal. No, they're just the boys.
Oh, just the boys. Just the boys, the boys.
Esther, stop being such a hussy.
Where's Emma?
she's with the other one.
where the fuck is she?
it's cool. What do you mean, where is she?
oi. Oi. Don't fucking "oi" me.
I've been playing cards here with you.
Oh, stop being such a hussy. She's in the restaurant, John.
look at you.
when he's looking at ya, that's when he's interested in what you're saying.
was he looking at you? Was I talking to you? No.
no. No. No. No. Fucking dickhead.
exactly. I don't know where Emma is.
girls, want to find Emma, bring her back in here, for just a minute?
would you? Go find Emma, bring her back in.
dickhead. Thanks.
see you, boys. Thanks.
they'll be back, mate.
Sam's a totally respectable guy, John, if that's, you know, what's...
he's completely honourable. Yep.
he might be a virgin, for all I know.
so are you guys going to the Gulf or what?
par 40. Pass by it. Yeah.
you see some action? Yeah, a bit.
Yep? What sort?
skirmishes, mainly. Pirates. We saw a fucking fishing boat, Dean.
he was so excited. This is his most exciting day on the ship.
...to talk about it. We saw a boat.
that he thought was a pirate boat. He ordered the side-arms out.
basically, things that the militia can't handle falls to us.
like fishing boats.
no pirates, huh? They're out there.
and it's part of our job to keep our eyes peeled for them.
Yeah, yeah, Captain Bluebeard, Yellowbeard, Blackbeard...
Yeah, I could have gone over there too, yeah.
ASIO, they wanted me.
where? ASIO doesn't go to war.
how do you know ASIO wanted you exactly?
because they came to our school. Came to your school?
high school, yeah. ASIO came to your high school?
when was that? '92.
92, was it?
well, it was right after Gulf the prequel, yeah.
exactly.
so, you know, they were talking about spies in Australia and what to look out for and what not, and this ASIO dude told me that I had the right kind of profile to be a political assassin.
dickhead. Dickhead.
ASIO don't have assassins.
who you calling dickhead, dickhead? You.
ASIO don't have assassins?
that's what they want you to believe.
I was fucking in every fucking class you were in, Tony.
I never saw any ASIO dudes. Bullshit. Bullshit, bullshit.
he told me if I channelled myself into some kind of focus,
I could have been one of the best ever, in the world.
that's pretty good. Thank you.
there was no fucking ASIO dude, dickhead!
fucking drop it! Told me that if I channelled...
fucking drop it!
settle the fuck down, will you, please, for fuck's sake!
maybe Tony wanted to play with the ASIO dude's Glock.
I didn't...
it's fucking true. Yeah. I'm...
not that part. No, no, no. I was more...
nothing.
so did you guys ever kill anybody?
it's not something we talk about. What's the matter? You get like?
bad flashbacks or... Shut the fuck up, Tony.
Hey, hey, hey. That's a legit question.
sorry, bad question.
bad question. It's cool, man.
no, no, 'cause my grandfather was in the Italian army.
Oh, really? Yeah.
like 50 million years ago. But... I won't go into the boring details.
bullshit. Shut the fuck up, Tony.
no, no, but, you know.
50 medals later, he did alright.
did really well. Bullshit.
but he never wanted to talk about it. Can we just play cards?
do you mind, mate? It didn't fucking happen.
it fucking happened, mate. You just need to shut the fuck up!
will you shut the fuck up?!
what have you got? My 50's in.
can I borrow another 50?
OK. It's in the ledger. Thanks.
so are you sober enough for this, Tony, or what? Tony,
want two?
don't need to be, playing you, V. Hey. At least I've got some left.
yeah? Dickhead.
four for me, John. How many do you want? John，
uh, no. I'll get off your mum later.
you're fine? I'm right.
I betcha. You what?
how many do you want?
fuck it! Three.
that's a wicked poker face he's got. Mate, I'm jinxed. I'm telling you.
you're on.
not yet. Gotta wait for Tony to bet, check or fold.
what are you gonna do? Come on, dickhead. Good game.
quick game.
Tony folds. I fold.
I'm going to raise...
bet. Bet?
I'm gonna bet the three.
300? Mm-hm.
you got a streak on, do you? Is that alright?
are you kidding me? What about you, sunshine?
fucking out.
owe you 50, owe you 250. Do you need to borrow it?
I'm right, mate. I'll win it back in a sec.
OK. Let's see ya.
let's see, mate.
fuck me.
I'm getting sick of this shit. I'm getting really pissed off.
how the fuck did you do that? Is that good?
that'll be a flush.
that is fucking bullshit. OK.
Hey, Johnny. I can't find her.
I'll just be back in a sec. I'll come with you.
no, it's alright. You stay here. I wasn't asking permission, mate.
I hope you and I can stay friends, Harry.
with that in mind, I think I'll pick up my winnings.
you can't just call it quits. No, no, bullshit.
mate, you're fucking ahead. Bad sportsmanship. You know it.
wait, you're leaving the table? Are you going to the toilet?
if you are, you can leave the table. If not, then you can't if no-one...
is that right? You making the fucking rules, are you, sunshine?
Harry, for Christ's sake. Leave the money. Let's go find Sam.
no, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want any trouble, but...
you understand?
Yeah, no, fair enough. OK. He's got a point.
no, it's alright. It's alright. You can take the fucking money.
you won it fair and square. I just want to know how you did it.
you weren't cheating. I can tell that.
what were you doing? You were counting them?
magician never tells.
well, you can tell me.
some people just win at cards.
I don't think you understand.
see, I'm seriously asking you to tell me.
it's fine. You won the money.
you can walk out of here, both of you, no problem, no trouble.
just tell me how you did it, that's all. What is it?
luck.
I found her. Fucking the other sailor up on the roof.
you fucking arsehole! Where's my other 100?
here we go.
Jesus!
shit!
Sammy!
Sam! Fuck!
shit!
wait, stop, stop, stop. Wait, wait, wait.
arsehole!
shithead.
Hey!
go! Go! Fuck!
shit! Go, go, go!
shit!
Hey, come here... Taxi! Taxi!
shit! Emma!
Hey! Emma! Get in! Get in! Get in!
give him the money! Give him the money!
come here! Come here!
fuck!
Dean the ma-fucking-chine.
I did not think we were gonna make it, man.
Cheers, brother. No sweat.
you should have seen him, Sammy. Fists of steel.
so was the little waitress worth all that, Sam?
Oh, well, you'd hope so, wouldn't you?
what the fuck's she doing here?
Hi. Sorry, ma'am. Hi.
what the fuck's she doing here? Poor Johnny's such a wannabe.
can my jaw disagree with you? What is she doing here?
have a small adventure until we ship out in the morning.
a small adventure? Fisher!
I shouldn't have told you guys.
Jake-O told me 'cause he was pissed and you guys took it seriously.
stole over a grand off 'em. Stole over a grand off your cousin.
just keep it on the hush-hush. I'll make it worth your while.
I knew I shouldn't have told you guys.
you should ignore him, by the way. Well, am I in the way?
no, hardly, ma cherie!
and don't trust this one at all.
no, I don't think I should.
we're supposed to meet them at a Japanese restaurant.
the gang, are they? Sally, Fred and Kathy.
can you drop us in the city somewhere?
can you fuck them off for a while? My fiancee.
for Sammy. For an hour.
guy fun, Dean. No, OK, for me, then.
please don't leave me with Prince and the fucking showgirl back here.
Oh! I got a better idea, Harry. Why don't you go with Dean?
and Sam and I can go back to his hotel room.
I think that's a terrible idea. That is a great idea.
sounds like the plan, Stan. Your vote doesn't count, sweetheart.
says who? Sammy, I want you to meet her.
Oh, for fuck's sake, Dean!
why would it be necessary for me to meet your fiancee and her fucking parents?
why would I need to do that?
how about this?
how about we all get out in the city,
Dean goes and has the Partridge Family wet dream and you, me and the delectable Emma all go have really fancy motherfucking cocktails.
how does that sound? Cocktails it is.
cocktails it fucking is.
friend of mine got beaten up in Hyde Park, by 15 guys.
a friend of mine did.Yeah, right.
1515-year-olds. They asked for his wallet.
he gave them his wallet. Then they beat the shit out of him.
doesn't matter if they're 15. If there's 15 of them, you're rooted.
you don't get that in Perth.
how was Sam in the taxi?
never seen him like that before. Yeah, it's good.
something's up, I reckon. Yeah, his dick.
speaking of which, do I have you as my wingman later this evening, or are you being all dedicated?
I'm always dedicated. What was Tokyo?
shut the fuck up about Tokyo. It was fun.
be nice to have one last hurrah.
Yeah, it would, with my fucking girlfriend.
fiancee. Shut up.
Harry.
come on! Catch up to me!
Heh-hey! Are you OK running in those shoes?
Yeah, they're flat but hard.
if I had flat shoes on like you, though...
well, I'm not carrying you.
how much fitness do you have to do in the...
well, it obviously hasn't paid off.
what the fuck am I doing?
what the fuck am I doing?
let's go faster.
did you see a navy guy come down here, an officer? Brown hair?
Yeah, running. With a blonde girl?
where? This way?
excuse me. Excuse me.
have you seen, like, another officer anywhere?
about this tall, with a blonde girl?
no. No?
OK. Thanks anyway. We'd see a uniform, though.
Yeah, good point.
fucking arsehole.
Sammy!
Emma!
who's Emma? Who's... The fucking waitress. Emma!
what part of Scotland are you from? Glasgow.
OK. Cool. I'm not walking with you at all. You...
have a good night. See ya.
not at all? OK. Thank you very much.
excuse me. If you see him, his name's Sam.
have you seen another navy officer around?
tell him he's in big trouble.
thank you very much. Sort of Italian-Iooking.
no. Alright. Cheers.
I'd do her, but...
what, the Scottish one? No.
I mean even the kind of 50s blonde bob one.
you're nuts.
he's off fucking someone. What we should be doing.
Sammy!
are you off fucking someone? Dean.
he's scarpered. He's bolted.
you keep saying that like it's a new idea.
Bad-bad or just bad?
Oh, alright.
I cried in f...
I cried in front of the whole crew.
well, everyone.
Oh, that's bad. Yeah, I know.
I cried like a little girl. Baby.
like a baby girl, in front of the whole crew.
that's not funny. That's sad.
where do you, um... where do you sleep on the ship?
bottom or top bunk? What's it to you?
I reckon you'd go bottom bunk. Am I top or bottom?
Yeah, you'd be bottom bunk.
what about you? What are you doing here? Huh?
what, lying in the middle of the park with a sailor?
Yeah. I don't know. Pretty cute.
alright.
but I've never lied in a park with a sailor before.
well, that's good. That's good to know.
Yeah. Neither have I.
I can live with that.
the uniform's actually quite nice. Yeah.
so you'll just go wherever...
Yeah. Anywhere?
no.
not Ukraine. Yeah?
Uruguay.
um... Yugoslavia.
OK. Just all the 'U' countries.
Yeah, right. Both of those.
what could you possibly have against...
nothing. I just don't... Yeah. That's none of my business.
and also Rotorua, New Zealand.
I went there on a soccer tour, and it...
it's, like, got egg gases. Smells like fart.
what about you?
do you speak any other languages?
no.
no?
can you do that again?
what are you saying?
what would you like me to say?
I was hoping... Yeah, OK. Some dirty French?
uh, that is really sexy.
Really? Yeah. It's really sexy.
well, I actually said... No, I won't tell you.
what?
ask me something and I'll tell you how to say it.
and then you've got to say it with a French accent.
will you...
will you kiss me?
did you think I was gonna say that? Yeah.
Est-ce...
no, um... Oh.
like, "I kiss you." So...
or...
dunno.
did I make you up?
I mean... Am I... am I insane?
two separate questions.
probably... Yeah. No. Yes.
sorry. That was really stupid.
just 'cause I'm speaking French that you can kiss me?
Oh, yeah. I wanted to before that. But...
Really? When?
I think... like, a good...
...the kind of the second I, um...
shut up. Shut up.
awkward.
what if it's more like a...
no, OK. That's it.
two strikes. That won't... That won't...
well, I'm gonna save the last one for the...
Yeah. So we'II... That batter just didn't go up to bat.
OK. Just went home.
so two strikes. So I got... one more go.
Yeah. OK.
OK. You could bunt, though.
I could bunt?Yeah.
I would really like...
you could do a Sax, like running squeeze or push bunt.
I would love to bunt here
anyway, I don't have any money. I've only got, like, $40. So...
maybe we might have to go down to, like, Wollongong or something.
but I do have a car.
there...
there's something I have to do first.
about this tall. Brown hair.
with a blonde girl.
looks a bit Italian-ish. This kind of uniform.
no?
could I wear your hat?
no. Sorry, that's against regulations.
do you want a photo? With you.
with me? You want a photo? OK.
sure. We got time for a photo?
I'll definitely sign you. Me too?
rose between two thorns?
anywhere? On the fun stuff? It's been six months.
OK. You can't spell your name, Harry?
you've got to press it.
Oh, I was talking. Let's do it again. What about kissing each cheek?
what about kissing each cheek?
Dean! Hello, Dean. Yeah, goodo.
you like a, um, s... sail man.
Hey. He's been on the ship for six months. So...
good work, guys. Keep on sailing. Would you give him a kiss?
you happy? Yep.
OK. You haven't seen our friend? The navy guy?
no. No. OK.
you're very pretty, by the way. Thank you!
you really are. You're very handsome too.
fucking hell. Did you see that?
did you see that? I took a photo of it.
that was fun. They were pretty cute.
they're 12.
old enough to bleed, old enough to butcher.
you've got it in you. See?
you have got it in you.
sorry to interrupt. Sorry to... interrupt.
excuse me. Have you seen a, uh... a navy officer?
brown hair. With a blonde girl.
not RAN?
can you tell him he's in big trouble?
so, what, you just sit down?
when you get dumped on every single day, Dean, you get real good at making yourself invisible.
where are we meeting your fiancee?
um, Juju's. Great.
no idea where it is. Awesome.
don't hold back is there anybody out there feeling something?
don't hold back is there anybody out there feeling something?
what are you doing? It's the best song.
turn it back up.
cause I want to watch you taking off your...
well, go on, then.
go on, what?
tell me a story if there's gonna be no music.
um... Alright, uh...
alright, um, can you slow down just a tiny bit, do you mind? Cheers.
I worked with my grandad until I signed up.
he's 84 and he still... he still runs the local leagues club.
uh, I managed... Just a bit. Slow... Sorry. Sorry.
I managed... I managed the bar there for a bit until, um...
...until I was fired by my own grandad.
and... that's...
dad. No, Dad fucked off when I was two.
so it was just me, Mum and Pop.
that... that's kind of it. I'm sorry. It's not very exciting.
Yeah, I think you should get out.
are you serious?
Yeah.
OK, very funny. Come on.
can we go, please? No.
come on.
Oh, come on, it wasn't that hard.
no, it's...
it's just one of, um... one of Glenn's favourite spots.
well, that's fucked. I didn't know that.
Oh! What was that?
Oh! Oh, OK, stop! Stop!
alright, alright, alright. You win, you win, you win. Stop, please!
Oh! OK, I'll show you something.
Oh, come on. We've got to go. I'm not doing that. Don't worry.
Oh, please. Watch.
an audition for 'Hey Hey It's Saturday'.
do you want me to play you a tune up my nose?
alright, that is disgusting.
can we please go?
Emma, please.
come on. OK, OK. I'm very impressed.
but, please, can we just go and stay within the, um...
...Within the, uh, speed limit?
Yeah. Would be good.
no.
do you have any other tricks with this?
no, not for now. Really?
right.
Hey, Mrs Fisher. Hi. It's Harry McCabe here.
I met you last Christmas. I'm a friend of Sam's.
Yeah. Have you, um... have you heard from Sam tonight?
right. Did he say where he was going?
no. Yeah. No, no, that's... that's... That's kind of...
Yeah, no, that...
that's kind of why I'm calling. We've just worked that out.
he's not... I'm gonna find him before they get to him.
I will find him.
I love him too.
Mrs Fisher, crying's not gonna get us anywhere.
it...
Mrs Fisher.
did he say to you where he was going? Any friends or family?
mate, you got any coins? Mrs Fisher...
mate, come on.
Mrs F... Fuck off. Mrs Fisher. Fuck off.
OK. Mrs Fisher, seriously...
OK. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to...
Harry McCabe. We met last Christmas. I had the...
I threw up... That's...
that's the one.
Yeah, with the funny moustache. That's the one.
Mrs...
I'm gonna have to go. I gotta find him. OK?
Mrs Fisher?
please stop...
Mrs Fisher!
Mrs...
so everyone's looking at me, and I'm like, "It's not Jake's fault.
he's never been in Bangkok before.
well, money's like that, you know.
you couldn't trust your own brother when it comes to money.
I mean... Well, think about Cain and Abel.
Oh, Cain and Abel wasn't about money, Fred.
Yeah, well, I mean... That was love.
it's the same thing in the world today.
Hey. Ooh! Hello.
Ah, there we are. We've been chatting up some babe, have we?
squash in here. Bet you were, Harry. I bet he was.
took your time.
Ah, you've got to take your time with the ladies, Dean.
he wasn't talking to a girl, Fred. You're so negative.
Oh, have some more food. No, you have some more food.
anyway, Harry, so Dad's company just bought some cargo ships.
and he needs two guys to be in charge.
and he said you and Dean can take over when you get back.
Wow! That... Yeah.
catch me up on all that, Fred. No, no.
terrific. Absolutely.
there's jobs for the boys. Um... You don't have to worry about that.
Yes, because I'm sure the first thing they want to do is get straight back on a ship.
Yeah, well, they may have a taste for it. They've found their sea legs.
Oh, you do whatever you want, Dean. No pressure, love.
I'm actually thinking about studying something like that.
sorry. Sally, don't be like that.
sorry!
no, just thinking about it.
like, what would you study?
I was thinking law or something.
Sally!
sorry. It's not fair.
mum, he... Come on, you hated university.
I mean, what, did you turn up for, like, two weeks and they never saw you again?
so who's talked you into this? No-one.
don't you listen to the peanut gallery, Dean.
she won't mind spending a lawyer's pay cheque, rest assured.
Oh, sweetie.
he can be homeless as long as he kisses me like that.
show-off.
so, what do you do for a crust, Sally?
Oh, I'm a social worker. Of course you are.
Yeah. Kids...
sorry? Pardon?
Oh, no, I, uh... Just the whole package. It's...
smart, sexy, funny and you help the underprivileged.
it's exactly what I pictured Dean having.
right, and, um, clearly you're the smart-arse friend who always gets him into trouble and then takes the credit for getting him out of it again.
I like you. Oh, and he doesn't have me.
Oh, you're good. She's good.
and what do you do on the ship, Harry?
um, communications.
Oh. What about for a crust? See? You're feisty.
she's feisty. I really...
I, um... I was a school teacher.
I signed up after 9/11.
Really? What did you teach? Mathematics.
look at you. Hey, Mum.
Oh, Sam!
what are you trying to do, kill me?
I had your friend calling at all hours. I haven't slept a wink.
you're not coming in. I am coming in.
no, you're not. He's not well, Sam. No, Mum, I want to see him.
he's not well enough.
well, we came to see you guys.
I brought him up to have no manners.
I'm Sam's mum. Hey, Ms Fisher.
Bernie, Bernie. Not Bernie Bernie, just Bernie.
sense of humour from his late father. Dad's not dead.
is that right? Mum, this is Emma.
Hey, Bernie. Come in.
can't have a lovely young girl like you standing out there like you're flogging insurance.
close the door, Sam.
see what he does to me? I haven't even got any face on.
Oh. Hope I look as good as you after I've had a brat like Sam.
let's keep our voices down.
how old do you think I am, Emma?
don't answer that.
I'll just imagine the answer.
do you prefer Em or Emma?
Either/or. My friends call me Em, so you can call me Em.
you hungry?
no, I've actually worked in a kitchen all night, so I'm kind of over food.
tea or coffee? Something stronger?
what's all this bloody hoo-ha? Oh, God.
no bloody sleep as it is, and when I finally bloody drift off, it's disturbed by bloody strangers.
Hey, Pop.
Hey, Pop. Oh! How are you? Good to see you.
you too. You look great.
cover yourself up, Dad! Oh, hello!
Bob Fisher, Sam's feeble old grandfather. Pleased to meet you.
pop, this is Emma. Sorry it's so late.
this isn't late. You've come to a party house!
Yeah, rage a minute.
come on.
come on, Emma. Help me with the drinks.
it's a new millennium, Bern.
why don't you ladies go and put your feet up while the men go hunt and gather?
he's just trying to impress you, Emma.
don't you burn down my kitchen again, Dad.
you what?
no, no, no, look.
what I'm saying is, my name is down there, and I'm ready to do it.
I don't want to have an argument with you. OK?
no, no, no... No, no...
do you think I need to come and step in?
Oh, my God. I'm happy to.
Dean. If you guys...
Yeah. I mean...
he is so embarrassing. I know.
he's just so uncultural.
Yeah, no, no. Speak English, OK?
look. You...
watch it, now. Watch it.
I'm sorry, but I think this is getting a little bit out of control.
I'm next on here, and I'm pissed off.
Hey! Hey! Come over here.
come. Come, come. Come over here. Look. Look at this.
I spoke to... Come here. How you doing?
you know what? Can they squeeze in here?
Oh, well, just... Sorry. Sorry, no.
I'm sorry, girls. What is your name?
hang on. It's OK. What's your name?
I'm sorry, girls.
Anna. Anna.
he's taking no notice. His name's down there.
and my name is next. OK?
excuse me. I'm quite uncomfortable about this.
with the contact? She's got her hand on your leg.
Anna! You...
what, are you trying to break up some...
this is a beautiful relationship. I'm just having a hot flush.
I love it, Anna. I love it.
Yeah. You tell him to go and sit down for a minute.
sorry? What language are you speaking now?
can you show Dean... show Dean your butterfly?
can you show your butterfly? What butterfly?
you know what butterfly.
you know exactly what butterfly I'm talking about.
show him the butterfly. Dean. Check the butterfly out.
do you know what? It's quite beautiful.
inappropriate. Do you have any butterflies, Anna?
Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.
well, I don't think we'll be coming here again.
Sally! Come on, don't play that role.
that's not a fun... That's not fun. That's not fun at the dinner table.
that's lovely.
that's very attractive. I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what. What if we got a little, like...
Dean! Check this out. See what I'm saying?
OK.
see how it feels? Yeah, it's terrible.
it's all a little party. You're not studying? What do you do?
you just go over there, sit down and wait, and I'll be a few minutes, right?
OK, yep. See you. OK.
Yep. Piss off. Piss off.
I've been wanting a good burger for six months, Pop.
how's the club?
mum said you might be expanding.
you still cleaning up after Simon?
Simon's a good man. Yeah, I know.
hard worker. Yeah, but...
you know, you always say that he's... I know what I always say.
I always say it. But it's not for you to say, though.
I'm probably gonna be made petty officer, Pop.
what's that?
I'm... I'm gonna be made petty officer.
probably.
you're joking, mate.
Nope.
I was petty officer.
I know. Why do you think I requested the position?
Hey, that's terrific.
my boy the petty officer.
Oh, they'll love that, Simon and the lads.
really stick it to 'em.
don't... don't tell Mum until it's all definite, though.
you're a good kid.
you've got a great smile.
what are you talking about?
get your hand off it and pass me the bloody onions.
so, what's this problem with you, Fred?
just argumentative, you know.
I mean, he can speak perfectly good English, but it's that thing, he just wanted to, um, make me think that, um,
I couldn't understand him.
I knew perfectly well that he was trying to jump the queue there.
dad! You're horrible! Was I?
Deano.
eye on the time, Harry.
I think we should...
what's going on with you two? You got some...
couple of hot dates or something?
gotta go meet Monica and Anna.
no, it's just, um... It's just... our friend.
Yeah. What?
uh, he's with a girl. Oh, who's with a girl?
that's who I was talking to on the phone before. He's gone somewhere.
we've got to go get him now, actually.
going through a bit of a rough time and they're strict on rollcall.
he's a really great bloke, actually. Wish you guys could have met him.
but he's...
excuse the salty language. He's a bit of a fucking drop kick.
he's had a rough time.
look, the XO took a...dislike to him, and, um...
can leave it at that. Yeah, well.
what, a little man with a big dollop of power?
that's it, Fred. Had one in the academy.
the academy? Fred wasn't a bang-bang copper.
I was in records, actually.
uh! I didn't say that.
because of his hip. Filing, mostly.
it was his hip. Yeah.
well, yeah, I have a wonky hip. Thank you, Kath.
no, there was this guy. He was named Trevor Sinclair.
Oh, God, Trevor Sinclair!
Yeah, well, he was the drill instructor.
can't remember anything about the ugly-Iooking prick's face apart from the fact that he had this great big vein that ran right down the middle of his forehead, right, and it would pulsate every time he screamed at me.
you're being quite random, Fred.
no, I'm not. Yes, you are.
OK. So, uh, yeah. Anyway.
what's happened? Has your friend gone AWOL or something?
if you say that, he gets arrested.
I don't think anyone can hear me.
is he in trouble or something? What goes on at sea stays at sea.
Oh, and other shite, Dean. You know, I think you should tell us.
Oh, come on. We want to hear it. Come on.
they want to hear it. Shut up, Harry.
come on. They want to hear it. We want to hear it.
Yeah, you should tell them, actually. Who are we gonna tell?
Yeah, who are they gonna tell? You tell us, then, Harry.
alright, fine, I will tell you. I don't think you'll tell anything.
actually, I don't know what...
I just don't think it's dinner conversation.
Oh, we've finished dinner, so it doesn't matter. So just tell us.
he's protecting me. He's so predictable.
we'll clear the table. We're family, you know.
you're related, almost. Tell you one of the tamer ones.
uh... One of the ones I know, anyway. Good.
it was Easter Sunday. Sam was on laundry duty that week.
and he hadn't put the uniforms in the dryer overnight.
so when he did 'em... Some more sake, sir?
Yeah, bring it on. Oh, great.
thank you. Thank you.
I might grab that. Anyone? Anything?
so when he did the uniforms in the morning, they all had that rotting damp smell.
Mmm. Oh, God, I hate that smell.
right, and it's, like, the officers' uniforms, so they were off-the-charts angry.
and... Like, you have to ration, you know, washing, showers, out there.
so they're walking around in these uniforms all week stinking like dead birds.
so two of us were ordered to take Sam into the bathroom...
you? Deano? Mate.
and we ordered him to strip, which he did, quickly.
and we cuffed him to the sink.
and we were given steel wool and deck brushes, which we used to scrub him down with until he was bloody and raw.
they were the exact orders.
he didn't make a sound the whole time.
and when it was done, Glenn, the executive officer, and I, urinated on the wounds.
then we hosed him off, put his uniform back on him, took him back to his post.
so...
there. You happy now? That's torture.
you're given an order and you take it, otherwise you're next.
Dean did what any of us...
I mean, that's disgusting. That's torture.
mum! Lay off him. That's disgusting.
lay off him! He just told us something full-on.
he told us something disgusting. That's absolutely disgusting.
Yeah, OK, and he gets an order and he takes it.
that's an excuse. I'm sorry, that is absolutely an excuse.
mum! Shut up! It's the navy.
the navy, exactly. It's the Royal... the Royal Navy!
Yeah, well, she's a monarchist.
now, just settle down, Kath. It happens everywhere.
it's a bit like Janine, you know... Janine?
...when she was harassing you at the pharmacy...
Oh, for heaven's sake, it's nothing like that.
on a... you know, on a different scale.
it's nothing like that. On a different scale.
how can, um, we help, Deano?
you know what you do? You...
you report him to the authorities and you get him booted out quick smart.
no, no, you don't do that. That is what you do!
that is what you do. Why not? No, you don't.
because the navy's like the force. The force?!
Oh, God, give it a rest!
you don't go dobbing somebody in. Shut up about the force!
well, no wonder he's gone AWOL. Don't fucking say AWOL.
sorry, Kath. He's with a girl.
he's just... That's... the size of it. He's with a girl.
let's shoot from the hip. Oh, what, your wonky hip?
your mate's a deserter. Go look up the word 'torture', Fred.
look, I'm just saying, that's the way he will be treated if he's convicted.
shit a brick, woman!
Ju... Look.
if he's gonna do the disappearing act, he has to do it right, right?
that's all I'm saying to them. Right? Not just the state.
he has to get out of the whole bloody country.
I mightn't know much, but I know that much.
listen to Carl Bernstein over here.
Yeah, well, I would prefer to refer to myself as Bob Woodward.
thank you very much.
well, you can't be Woodward, 'cause he's dishy.
you get yourself a top-shelf lawyer.
just do that. You deny everything and you just hope for the best.
that's what you do.
I'm sorry, I'm just a little bit...
I'm sorry, Dean, love, it's not your fault. It's just that this...
I'll say a prayer for your friend. Look.
I might be able to help him get out of the country.
you and your wonky hip are gonna help, are you, Fred? Oh, my God.
can we have the check? Let's get the check.
get the check. Check!
the house is just getting too big for us.
losing the garden's gonna kill me, naturally.
are... are you gonna tell your mother? Tell me what?
Oh. No, I don't really want to show off, Pop.
he's been made petty officer.
is that right?
it's not official yet.
isn't that amazing? Amazing's the word.
Hey, guess what. Did Sam tell you when he caught a tiger shark?
Emma! What's this?
Sam. Anyway, I'll tell the story, 'cause, you know, he's too modest.
so the boys have the day off and so they're on the boat fishing.
and then after, like, an hour, he notices something on the end of the fishing rod, like, pulling really hard.
and so as he goes to wind it in, everyone starts to look around, and it's a tiger shark.
and then naturally, all the guys gather around and try to, like, help him and take the credit.
and Sam, like, shrugs them off and says - my favourite part
no, boys, this is between me and the sea.
that's my boy.
but I think they were kidding when they said the captain had it mounted in his cabin.
Emma! You bloody dark horse!
so...
tell me about you two. Mum.
where did you meet? Mum.
a mother's entitled to know about her son's love-life.
and a father's entitled to know about his daughter's.
I like your hair.
wouldn't have been regulation in my day.
better than the dreadlocks. Dreadlocks?
she's very pretty. Her name is Emma.
she's sitting next to you, Mum.
Sam's pretty. Ha!
Hey, guys can be pretty too. Sam's got pretty eyes. Like Bob's.
you can bring her again. Oh, please!
what about some Scotch to celebrate?
girls?
a little dabble? Sure.
don't... don't go to any trouble. No.
what's this game you're playing, Sam?
do you want to give him another heart attack, do you?
trying to make life difficult for me?
get back at me for something? Come on, tell me!
I just wanted to see him happy.
for how long?
and I wanted you to be happy 'cause he was happy.
happy for how long, Sam?
what happens when he...
you're a fool!
and now you're a fugitive. Lovely.
Bernie, you don't understand. I don't like you.
let's get that clear from the outset, Miss Tiger Shark.
but, Bernie... My name's Mrs Fisher.
Mrs Fisher, they tortured him. He needs a bit of discipline.
structure.
this... this wasn't structure, Mum.
when are you ever gonna finish anything you start, Sam?
I'm not heartless.
some people even think I'm quite nice.
well, that's not true, but I can act nice.
it's just that whatever Sam's involved in is an ordeal.
I've got the single malt. Wow!
so we can have a taste test.
no sex.
going to parties by myself.
one email a month.
you've got no idea what it's like.
Yeah, it must be hard. I feel terrible for you.
Hey! You signed up, not me. Yep.
just promise me you'll be careful, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Hey.
just... promise me you'll remember me and...
...You'll remember you have this great life waiting for you.
life that's gonna be wonderful and...
...Lucky and... full of love.
just promise me.
baby, I promise you.
I promise. Yeah.
it's a different world out there.
it's like when you're at school, you know
like, the whole universe crumbles if you haven't done your French homework, you know?
cause that's all you know. It's the same out there.
cause that's all you know.
and when it's good... baby, when they smile on ya, life is roses.
alright. OK, kids. Alright, kids.
we alright? OK.
uh! Uh! OK. Come on.
how about you, Harry? You got a girlfriend?
no, thanks. Mmm?
no, thank you.
what... what is it?
you've been heartbroken? Is that what it is?
mate, you're not. Are you gay?
no, thank you.
Oh, come on, tell us.
me and Kath, we're good. Very good.
Yeah, well, we're the leading lights at our group therapy sessions.
Oh, Fred, he doesn't know. What?
it's called couples rehabilitation.
it's for people who've had emotional and sexual trauma in their relationships.
Yeah, OK. Look. We started about six months ago.
and you wouldn't believe what a world of difference, Harry, it's made.
believe you me. Good!
so, what is it, darling?
once bitten, twice shy. Is that it?
a handsome man like you should be, um...
Kath!
...Getting as much as you can.
OK, OK, OK. Let's keep going. Keep going.
it's alright, it's alright. No, no. It's OK. It's OK.
how far are we walking? Just look at the fountain.
Hey! That's a great fountain. Isn't that beautiful?
those things that I did... I don't care about what you did.
just... It doesn't matter to me, alright?
Yeah, babe... Look...
just... go find your friend.
OK?
Really? Yeah.
I'II, um...
I'll just... I'll meet you at the docks in, like, five hours.
alright?
that'll give us 45 minutes for you and me plus, you know, 15 minutes travel time to get you back for rollcall.
I've kind of got it all worked out. Oh, yeah?
Yeah, there's this, like, long, dark street two blocks over from Harry's Cafe de Wheels.
Hello! And I am bringing the station wagon.
I love you.
well...
I just can't wait to see you out of this uniform.
OK, OK, OK. Just a sec. I've got to throw up.
Yep. No, don't. No, no, no.
let's keep walking. You'll be fine. You'll be fine.
Oh, I feel great.
absolutely fine. We can have a shower in the fountain.
that'd be cool.
Yeah. Cool.
OK, OK. Alright.
do you want to shower with me?
uh, no.
would you like to lather me?
um, Deano, I think it's cab time for these two.
Yeah, but I heard what you were saying.
no. What? I wasn't flirting!
that's my arm, Fred, not hers. I said there was chemistry.
I didn't say we should do anything about it.
God! Oh!
Whoa! Jesus!
really sorry.
you right? You right? Fuck. Yep.
fucking hell. I thought it was funny.
Oh, Jesus! You right?
what have you done, McCabe? He's broken my fucking nose!
Oh, you're alright. Have you hurt yourself?
mum!
come on, Kath. Get up. Shut up, Kath. You OK?
he's broken my fucking nose, man.
What'd you do? He's broken my nose.
alright, Kath, have you hurt anything?
Harry, Harry, Harry. Did you look up my dress?
you right? Here we go.
Hey, can you get a cab? Yeah, sure.
leave me alone! Mum!
leave me alone. Leave me alone. Mum!
do you mind getting a cab or something?
fuck it.
it's alright. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I think... Jesus! Can we just not?
dad. Dad. Can you just control Mum, please?
dad! That's my mother-in-law.
Yeah, I'd love one. Mum, go home with Dad.
you are embarrassing the fuck out of me right now.
where is he?
you OK? Can you just take Mum home?
you're not on medication or anything like that, are you?
I have never been better. I have never, ever...
see, this is what it's done for us.
watch this, now. You ready? You watching?
you ready?
just leave them.
are you watching? Hey, hey, hey. Yep.
this is how you do it. Alright?
awesome to meet you. Thanks, Sally, for tonight. It's been great.
is my nose crooked?
please tell me my fucking nose isn't crooked.
let's go to the hotel.
Dean, this is the fucking end of the monologue. Let's go to the hotel.
OK, this might sound about... a bit, you know.
what if we go to shore patrol?
Yeah, it sounds ludicrous.Jake's a mate.
is anyone not your mate?
he might do us a favour and keep it quiet.
well, how is the weather in Fools Paradise, Dean?
we could explain it to them.
Oh, we'd explain it to them? Great!
what would we say? What's the first thing you'd say?
it's a thought. Next thought, please.
no, here we go.
OK, we can't dillydally.
Dillydally?What's wrong with dillydally?
Hi.
Hey.
Goodnight.
got the time, mate?
uh... yeah, it's, uh...
...2: 27, on the dot.
so it's not midnight?
no. Nope.
Yeah, my watch must be...
hang on, you're saying it's...
you're saying it's exactly two hours and 27 minutes after midnight?
Yeah. Have a good one.
Yeah, I'll try.
Sam Fisher, yes?
Yeah.
we can do this out in the hallway if you want, Sam.
I run a legitimate business. I'm not ashamed.
no, mate. I don't know what you're talking about.
let me explain.
come on.
see, one of the girls is taking it personally, like it's a rejection or something.
girls? What... what girls, mate?
I mean, it's... That's just rude. OK, look, you know what?
I reckon there's been some sort of misunderstanding here. We're...
we're not the people you're after.
there's been some sort of misunderstanding.
there's a cab as well. I mean, you were supposed to pay for that.
OK. I get here, meter's up to 70 bucks.
he's kept it running the whole time. Can't blame him for that.
totally understand. Where's it coming from?
I reckon you've got the wrong room.
well, we do a callback as soon as the order's made, chummy, so...
OK, look, you're out a lot of money. I understand.
this has to be some sort of mistake. Just go back.
Emma, shut the fuck up, please, please. You're not helping.
there's... Yeah, there's been a mistake, Sammy.
about 600 bucks' worth.
Oh, just help yourself for a drink.Hey, it's all good.
you're not... You're not...
600 bucks - I'll let you off for 50, seeing as I'll give the girls a lift home.
they won't need a cab. How's that? Can't say fairer than that.
Yep. It's Harry. It's my friend.
it's my stupid fucking friend. That's it. It's not me.
Oh, well, your stupid fucking friend isn't here now, is he, Sammy?
why don't you just go back? Emma, it's all good.
just shut the fuck up.
just shut the fuck up, Emma. Do yourself a favour.
go back to fucking England, you wanker.
I'll tell you what, you know, for your information future reference and all
uh, that pussy I was gonna get you is far better than this.
Ooh! You've got balls, have you, Popeye?
I'll tell you what, you give me my 650
and we'll get 'em out, we can all see.
look, just go home, seriously. Whoa!
I hope that wasn't your big guns.
Hey.
be a pal. Let me back in.
back off, Sam. It's no good. No, it's still there. Hey, mate!
no, Sam, go get a pillow.
Hey.
Hey, mate. Are you OK? Tell me what to do.
where do I put it? Just underneath. Here. Hold on.
mate, you OK? Mmm.
can you move your neck? Yeah.
OK. Sam, just calm down.
you OK, mate?
Yep.
Hey, do you know where you are?
Hote...
Yep.
no.
hotel. Yeah.
Yep.
what... what's your name? It starts with a 'W'.
Warren. Great. Fantastic, Warren.
first go. I'm one of the Wombles.
warren the Womble.
you're not one of the Wombles, mate.
who's your favourite Womble?
what year is it? Mmm... Tomsk.
he's a big one. What year is it, mate?
what year? Hey. Warren, concentrate.
Mmm... Orinoco?
no, what year... what year is it?Orinoco?
Tobermory was clever with his hands, wasn't he?
he was the clever one. Alright. We'd better get him up.
let's see if you can sit up. Hey, Warren.
Yep.
we're gonna get you up. Alright, mate?
OK. Come on, Warren.
come on, Warren. Oh, fuck!
Hey, it's OK, Warren. It's all good. Someone hit me.
Yeah, I had to hit you.
Yeah, he's sorry. He didn't mean to. OK, come on.
come on, let's get you up into the bed.
Sam, his neck. I know. He's fucking heavy.
come on, Warren.
Hey, it's all good. Just over here. Put him on the bed.
where am I?
you alright, mate?
Yep. Hey.
Hey, Warren. Yeah?
look here.
look over here. Warren. Warren.
Warren.
Hey.
you're gonna be OK. I'm OK.
Yeah.
Where's my dog? You didn't bring a dog.
Where's my dog?
do you remember why you came here, mate?
Yep. Came with a... With t...
the Wombles. Two girls.
the girls. You made the Wombles cry.
I didn't make... I didn't make the Wombles cry. I made the girls cry.
I'm really sorry. Sorry.
Hey.
I think we should get him...
Warren, I think we're gonna get you to a hospital, OK?
I'm sweet. I'm sweet. You sure?
someone hit me.

got my football socks on. Pull.
you've got your football socks on? Got my football socks on.
you're a football fan, are you?
comment?
it's rude to speak in another language.
I like to be a bit international, Candy.
not with that accent.
how are you doing there, Candy?
Oh, best I've ever been.
how long have, um...
fucking people for money?
about 10 years professionally.
I used to get taken out for dinner.
and then I'd be taken home in the Maserati.
and, um... Yeah.
Yeah, I used to get all the good stuff then.
I prefer it now.
Why?
now I know what I am.
this is Mr Bowen.
warren Bowen - that's me!
he's hit his head, so he's got a concussion.
Oh, Warren. And his hearing's slightly impaired.
so that's why he's shouting, OK? Alright!
are you alright? No alcohol for 48 hours, OK?
put your jacket back on. No, it's fine.
I don't need it. You'll get cold. Put your jacket on.
Warren, I'll get you the money, mate, I swear.
stop being stubborn. Put it on.
I'll get you the money, I swear.
terrible thing to owe money, Popeye.
Yeah.
just forget about it, eh?
Thanks.
you're supposed to offer again, aren't you?
taking advantage, eh, isn't he? Yeah.
no, Dr Paulie says that I'm gonna come out of this looking well scary, so...
...It's sweet, eh?
Yep. Leave me alone now, girls.
we're gonna hold you up. You can't.
you can't. You can't stand up. Fucking leave it!
got me good, Popeye.
won't happen again.
won't happen again.
no free hit next time, eh?
it was a big mistake, that.
here, I've got you. Mmm.
come on. Hold him.
au revoir. See you. 'Bye.
see ya. Let's go and have a beer.
no beer.
we can have a beer.
listen. Hey.
I've guessed.
and it's OK.
it's cool.
cool? Yep.
no.
look at you in your... nice scruffed shoes and your slick hair.
tight belt.
hang on.
do you want me to take your bag? Yep.
alright. Final... You walk like a girl anyway.
...Humiliation.
Hey, champ. Scotch, double. No ice.
Glenn.
Harry McCabe. How are ya, mate?
look at us. How are ya?
sit down. Thanks.
how are you faring? Getting there.
Oh, do you... Do you still partake?
Yeah, the wife doesn't like it.
I don't see her. She's upstairs. She smells 'em.
can't get away with anything.
they're good like that.
no.
so, uh, how's my boy doing?
he's good.
you looking out for him? Yeah.
Yeah. Course I am. He'll be fine.
have you met Deano's little lady yet?
I...
uh, yeah, yeah. She's, um... She all that?
Oh, she's not my...
she's giggly. You know? I like it when they giggle.
Oh! Oh! HMAS 'Dignity'.
it's a good boat. How the fuck did you know that?
Deano's got a big mouth. Is that right?
Deano. Have you heard about the guy who's replacing me?
makes me look like the fucking Wiggles.
Oh... Yeah.
it was me, Glenn.
I told 'em what you did to Sam. Sorry?
I snitched on you.
pardon?
I... think you heard me.
Oh, Harry.
Oh, Harry.
you've got no idea what the next six months of your life are gonna be like.
do you realise how much pain once I tell the boys? Jesus.
I mean, strap yourself in, Harry.
no, you can't touch me. I'm sublieutenant.
let's see.
let's just see.
you're weak, Harry.
you're what's wrong with us.
you are.
not Sam. You see, I like Sam. He's done his time in the shit box now.
he can face anything.
but you...
you know, the brain is man's worst enemy?
you are never gonna understand toughness, are you, mate, 'cause you just worm your way out of everything.
but that's the world.
Sam will thank me one day for what I did for him.
and so will you.
I would very much like it if you would fuck off now.
and get a fucking haircut.
because you're not fooling anybody with that.
fuck off, please. Go on.
Jesus.
think I shat my inner child.
Sam...
I thought...
I thought you'd done yourself in.
surely I'd still be in if I had.
what the fuck happened, then?
Harry hired some hookers, apparently.
I tried to stop him.
just like you tried to stop Glenn?
Where's... Emma. She's gone home.
where the fuck's McCabe? He's mad at me.
what else is new?
no, mate. He's... really mad.
you're right, Sam. About what, Dean?
I'm not going back either.
waitress was a virgin, was she?
we'll serve eight months max.
I'll get out. I can marry Sally.
what do you think?
hand ourselves in together?
so sorry, Sam.
I... I just tried to believe that that wasn't me doing that.
I'll tell 'em. I'll report Glenn. I'll tell 'em what I know.
and what I did.
I... I don't want you to do that.
I have to.
I'm going back, Dean.
no...
no-one forced me into this.
and no-one's gonna force me out.
how can you go back?
it's a terrible thing to owe somebody.
it'll happen again.
and I'll serve my time.
what if they make you do it?
fuck 'em.
drink quickly. We've got to make a move.
where you off to? Rollcall. Slack-arse.
I knew it. I knew it. You knew shit.
crawling back.
we've got to go.
can I ask you something?
can you hand me in?
Yep.
you'll be having breakfast with Sally before we're even out on the harbour, mate.
I'll meet you in the foyer.
Christ, I hope he makes a run for it.
I'm fucked.
I'm gonna apply to be petty officer.
Congrats.
should we do a runner on the carpet trauma and just leave a massive tip?
sure.
yes?
Yep.
is my nose crooked?
I don't think so.
Hey, thanks for those hookers, by the way.
Oh. I forgot. Was that helpful?
not in the slightest.
let's go party!
Yeah, baby!
Yeah! Gilly, get out here!
Yeah! Yeah!
let's go, baby, we got bitches waiting!
go! Faster! Put the pedal to the metal!
party! - Go! Go! Go!
Yeah, Jake!
Yeah!
Hey, ladies. We are here. - You guys are crazy!
get ready to party. - Yeah!
we are here!
Whoa!
yo, Nathan.
dude, you're crazy.
Yes, I am.
you all right, man? Okay. - Yeah, I'm good.
let's do this. - Let's go.
check it out! - Dude.
Gilly!
yo, guys, be right back.
what's up, homey? Check it out, man.
good quality. You like?
Thanks, man. This is hot.
that's right. All right, man. Peace.
two hundred bucks, man.
dude, that's criminal.
no, it's a fair price.
I make the best fake IDs in Pennsylvania.
you know what? You should put that on your college application.
dude! I can't believe how mainstream you guys are.
you guys are so mainstream. I gotta get you some underground...
yo, heads up. Coming your way.
here we go again.
Uh-oh. Here she comes.
Hey, Karen. - Hi, Nathan.
watch it.
watch it? Watch what? You bumped into me.
Billy! Billy, I'm serious! Listen to me.
come on.
is he serious? - Whoa.
that was exciting. - Let's go get drunk.
you ready? Hold it, hold it!
wait! Ball! Ball! Ball!
every time!
all right. - Oh, wait, wait, wait! Announcement!
a little gift from my dad.
VIP tickets to the first Pirates home game.
dude, I will drink to that.
let's have a good night, boys! - Let's toast! Let's do it!
a great night! - Yeah!
Whoa!
look at this guy. Hey, wake up.
look, whoever you are, you gotta get out of here.
my parents will be home in an hour.
all right, girls, we have to hurry up. My parents will kill me.
Trish, do you have any more bags?
you know, you really don't have to help me pick up all this stuff.
it's okay. It's the least I can do.
if my parents see you here, they might get really pissed at me, though.
Yeah. Mine, too.
perfect timing.
all right, get those mitts on. - Wake up.
can't believe you're making me fight hungover.
you wanna drink like a man?
let's see if you can fight like a man. Come on, let's go!
hit me.
come on! Hit me! It's not patty-cake. Punch me! Here!
move your feet!
I'm right here. Knock my head off. Come on!
come on, Son!
hands up!
my boys.
hands up! Come on!
this is bullshit.
I'll tell you what's bullshit.
bullshit's getting so drunk that you can't defend yourself.
you can't watch your back.
that's bullshit, Son.
come on! Turn around! Move! Let's go!
Kevin - Kevin! - What?
bet you're glad you went last night now.
doesn't taste as good on the way out as it did on the way in, I'll bet, huh?
see, this is what I call a party.
you wanna hurt me, Nathan?
don't get mad, get even. Don't lose control.
think about it. Clear your head now. Focus.
bear hug? That's all you got?
come on. Your mother hits harder than that. Show me something.
you're so slow!
come on! Pay attention! Come on.
use your head, Nathan. Think!
you better show me something soon, Son, or you're gonna go down.
come On!
I thought we were boxing.
you always said the person that ends the fight was the winner.
do I look like I'm done?
you want to play with no rules?
you better be careful what you let out of the box.
come on. Get up! That wasn't that hard, Nathan.
what's the matter? Come on. Use your anger.
think about it. Keep control.
look for an opening. What are you gonna do?
you can't punch me. You can't kick me.
what are you gonna do?
come on!
is that all you got? You gotta get me off balance.
gonna dance all day? You gonna show me something?
good shot.
now we're talking.
I'm bigger than you, but you can take me, Nathan. Come on!
wait till you get old.
Hey, guys. Guys!
Kevin!
you got me! Finish me off! Take me...
enough!
what? We're just working out.
you look like you're trying to kill each other.
Nah! No, we're good. Right, Nate?
good job, Son.
you...
God, you smell like beer.
can I take a shower?
I just don't went to get a phone call one night that you wrapped your motorcycle around a tree.
I wasn't even driving.
Hey, you were out all night. You didn't call. You're grounded for a week.
are you serious?
Yeah, I'm serious.
Why? Do you not trust me?
after last night, not so much.
did you ever hear that phrase, "Trust needs to be earned"?
he doesn't do yoga. - Whoa!
he did yoga before. - He did not do yoga.
tell him. - You went to a yoga class?
mom took me. - You're serious?
see? And you were in pain the next day.
admit it. Tell him. - When did you take him to yoga?
you didn't ask me about taking him to yoga.
I have to ask you everything that I do?
no. If you believe in secret lives in this house,
I didn't get the memo.
your dad needs yoga. Tell him.
he has more important things to do with his day.
you really do need yoga.
it's good for your mind. - What's yoga for?
your body. Your spirit. - Tell me a practical application for yoga.
you could use some. - That'll happen the day I take up basket-weaving.
Hey, Nathan, you're on clean-up duty.
come on. Your mother cooked. I worked all day.
what did you do? - That's right.
are you going to spin me? Whoa!
you got it.
you've gotten better and better, you know that?
you always have new problems.
it's always my fault. - What is it now?
it's every single time, Billy!
because it's mostly your fault, Karen!
it's always my fault! - Have you thought about that?
all you think about is football.
if you're so over this, then just get out of here!
you know what? I will get out of here. - I don't need this.
you're in high school, Karen. I could have any girl I want in college.
God!
what are you looking at, freak?
sometimes I do feel like a freak.
I walk around like everybody else.
but inside I just feel different.
like I'm a stranger in my own life.
or I'm sitting at the breakfast table with my parents, and I'm just like, "Who are these people?
don't you think everybody feels that way growing up?
do they all go to a shrink?
not everyone has insomnia and impulsivity and rage issues, Nathan.
I used your technique.
last night, this guy snapped at me, and I had this overwhelming urge to run across the street and smash his face in.
but you contained it.
Yeah. I put the anger away.
I chilled. It wasn't worth it.
that's great, Nathan.
do you realize we probably would have been having this discussion in juvenile court a year ago?
you're making progress.
but I still have the dreams.
when was the last one?
two nights ago.
any new details?
it was mostly the same.
I see the woman standing there.
she starts singing to me. I think it's a lullaby.
then comes the attack.
and then it's over.
Nathan, some dreams are based in reality, but others are our mind's way of handling anxiety just by pushing it deep into your subconscious.
that's not necessarily a bad thing.
don't most psychiatrists want to unearth these things?
I'm not most psychiatrists.
our time is up.
have a good week, Nathan. - Thanks.
go, Talbots, go!
I think you won that match. - Definitely.
you know what? You guys are both dicks, okay?
I don't know how y'all convinced me into joining the wrestling team.
it was your idea. - "It's fun, Gilly, it's fun.
you know what? It's probably a lot of fun when you out there kicking ass, but let me tell you, it's a lot less fun when you getting the smack down.
come on, Nathan. Come on!
you got this! You got him! - Hold on! Hold on!
you got him! Take him down! Take him!
Damn!
pin him down, man. You got this! You got this!
keep him pinned!
game over!
Yeah, sure.
it's easy when your guy just rolls over for you.
come on, he didn't even put up a fight.
could you take him? - Yeah, probably.
whoa.
you joining the militia group or something?
so I go to the gun range three to four times a week to blow off steam.
I'm a virgin. What else am I gonna do?
true.
he was there, right? - He was there, but he hasn't called me back.
here we go again. You look at her.
she glances back at you. You both totally dig each other.
and yet nobody pulls the trigger.
grow a pair and make that happen, man.
you act like you're afraid to talk to her.
I'm not afraid.
I don't wanna go to class. - Me neither.
fine.
watch.
Hey.
Karen.
smooth. - Yeah.
all I'm asking is that you do the minimal amount of work in this class to give yourself the illusion that you're actually learning something, and to give me a modicum of self-respect, like I'm actually teaching a class.
it's called sociology. The study of society.
people. Besides yourselves.
you're going to choose one of these topics on the screen to be the subject of your 10-page research paper.
you should know that your 10-page research paper is going to constitute 75% of your midterm grade.
Yes, yes, I know, I know, I know. Your lives have been ruined.
but you know what Mr. Miles is gonna do for you?
I'm going to assign you a partner, so that you can learn to share responsibilities, to share the work load.
Ernesto, you're gonna work with Susan.
Nathan, meet Karen.
Gilly, you're gonna be working with Sean.
and let's see, Ladislav and Mohammed.
Romeo, Juliet.
Hey, Mrs. Harper. - Hey, how are you?
I'm not doing all the work for you on this research paper.
you got that?
got it.
you still like games.
when was the last time you were here?
you had a bunk bed.
Wow.
Hey.
kids want something to eat or drink or some more pillows to sit on the floor?
mom.
okay. You want the door open or closed?
close it. Please.
okay.
uh, well, we should probably get to work.
says here over 2, 300 Americans are reported missing every day.
I found a website for missing kids here.
they have height, weight, age, favorite foods, medical reports.
check it out.
Wow.
last place they were seen. People they were affiliated with.
everything.
Yeah.
I'll send you this link.
what was that story I heard about you waking up in your underwear on the lawn after that party?
just a practical joke.
right. - Not worth explaining.
and I had pants on. Yeah.
I thought your boyfriend was gonna take a swing at me that night.
he's not my boyfriend.
hmm.
What'd you say to him anyway to make him back off so quickly?
I told him that you'd kick him in his big fat head and embarrass him in front of everyone if he didn't stop acting like a dick.
how'd you know I would have kicked him in the head?
how long have we lived across the street from each other, Nathan?
Hey, check this out.
what is it?
I found this site that shows you mock-ups of what missing kids might look like today.
and if you recognize a person, you can click on their childhood pics.
check out this guy!
Jason Statham meets Justin Bieber.
seriously!
uh, next.
Oh.
Ryan Seacrest meets...
lady Gaga. - Whoa!
next.
Matt Damon meets you.
that doesn't look like me.
Nope. You're right. It's definitely not you.
this kid's too cute.
could you send me a link to that site? - Yeah.
my uncle's coming to check up on me 'cause my folks are out of town.
when did you want to start outlining?
how about I come over in an hour?
Yeah, yeah, awesome. Bye.
weird.
you're gonna put me off my food now.
marlin and Lorna Price?
so the lemon and then the capers.
Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey, where do you think you're going?
what?
come here. Did you forget you were grounded?
Nathan. Your mother said get over here. Get over here.
what's up? Are you going to Karen's?
Yeah, it's for a school project. - What project?
it's on websites.
can I go? - And you have to get it done tonight?
and it has to be finished? - Pretty much.
for school? - For school.
if it's for school, right? - Right.
he's still grounded. - Right. Okay.
it's work.
okay.
okay. - Be quick.
understood. - Be back for dinner.
deal.
Bye. - And behave yourself.
our little boy.
I can't believe I just agreed to that.
God, Karen. I remember when she was just a child.
she's kind of hot now.
she's sweet. And kind. - Sweet. Did I... I meant kind.
and he's a good boy. - Yeah.
all right, I see the resemblance, but I really don't think this is you, Nathan.
okay, good. Tell me why.
first of all, this kid's three-and-a-half years old.
don't we all look the same at that age?
Yes. But we have the same exact chin.
coincidence.
fine. Explain this.
okay. It's a similar shirt.
not just the shirt.
the stain on the left shoulder.
here. Look.
holy shit.
online contact.
steven Price.
Brighton Beach, NY
my name is Marisa.
Marisa?
Nathan...
MARISA：Hello, My name is Marisa, I'll be helping you with this case. What is your name?
possibly.
can you tell me more about how he dissapeared?
Marisa: What is your location Mr. Harper?
I mean, I don't get it.
don't you think it's weird that she wants to know what your address is?
why does it matter where you are now?
you could just be tipping them off.
it's really suspicious to me, Nathan. It doesn't feel right.
don't you think you should talk to your parents about this?
london, ENGLAND
Mr. Kozlow.
you wanted me to notify you immediately if the website got a hit.
and if anyone ever finds out, then you're gonna get in trouble 'cause it's probably a false accusation.
and then I'm gonna get in trouble because now I'm involved, too.
don't you think it's weird?
maybe this is all just a mistake.
you could be adopted.
you know, dropped on a doorstep. You never know.
if I were adopted, why would my picture end up on a missing persons website?
a better question would be if this is for real, then who are those people living in your house?
we're gonna be out there, We're gonna dive...
he's gonna wanna dive with us, okay?
we need you to study. All right?
rigging. How weather changes.
there'll be times your mother and I are asleep.
you got to take the helm. Our lives will be in your hands.
I don't wanna make this sound too ominous, but it's dangerous out there.
the ocean is a big scary beast, man.
certificate of Birth
what you got there?
um...
I lost my driver's license.
need this to get a new one.
that what's really going on?
Yeah, what else would be going on?
you're not getting a fake ID?
no.
what's going on, man?
I don't know. - Must be losing my mind.
my parents are too boring to be psychos.
Hey, you never know, man.
now here's you at two years old.
Three-ish.
five.
nice. Nice.
whoa, whoa, wait a second.
okay. You see this picture of you when you were five?
Yeah, why? - It's cropped weird.
slight outline of a person's shoulder.
clearly zoomed in a touch, like someone didn't wanna be seen in this picture.
any more photographs of you when you were younger?
those are the ones that are questionable.
not really.
just a ton more of me by myself.
a few family photos is all you have from your childhood?
all that I could find.
Nathan, I've got a million embarrassing family photos.
enough to make me wanna vomit. And you're telling me all you have is two?
what? You're too cool to say hi now?
Hi.
teenagers.
Hi, bud.
what you looking at?
your baby shirt.
are you my mother?
you are my son.
you don't understand, baby. It's complicated.
answer me.
are you my mother?
no, Nathan. I'm not.
we wanted to tell you for so long and we just couldn't.
go ahead. Tell me. All of it.
Kevin's a part of this. I gotta go.
sweetie, don't judge us so quickly, all right?
you don't know.
I love you.
you're what's made us a family.
I love you and you're my son. Nothing's gonna change that.
don't.
don't.
I'm so sorry.
don't hate me, okay?
gotta go get your dad.
yeah? - Hey. I heard you pull up, so...
Karen, it's true. My mom just admitted it.
what? God, Nathan, you must be freaking out. I'll be over in a minute.
okay, come in the back door.
I'm so sorry.
ms. Harper? - Yes.
how are you this evening? - Fine, thank you.
we're investigators with the Bridgewater Juvenile Justice Department.
it's about your son Nathan. I have a couple questions for him.
may we come in for a moment?
wait, wait, wait!
Kev!
where is he? Where is he?
tell us where he is.
you can't have my son!
who are you?
get it started. I'll get the kid.
Mara.
go, Nathan, go! Go now!
no, Son. Run!
and don't stop!
Karen.
Hey. Get in the house.
come on, move.
it's going to be all right. You're gonna be fine.
you won't even feel this. Such a waste, you know that?
Hey!
who are you?
who are you? Answer me! Answer me!
Nathan, stop.
you killed my parents!
stop. Stop. I'll tell you what you need to know.
but I'm not dying here. There's a bomb in the oven.
what?
Oh, my God!
dive!
sir, you're next.
dr Pedway...
thank you, sir. Have a nice day.
how bad is it? - I don't know. It hurts.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
we need a doctor. Anybody? We need a doctor, please.
Hello? Hello?
911. What's your emergency?
my parents were just murdered.
and I think the people who did it are after me, too.
what's your location, sir?
I'm at a hospital.
Vassar Brothers Hospital.
but my parents were killed at...
please hold.
hold? What do you mean, "Hold"?
I'm Slade McKassen- Topping our news, a dramatic fire in suburban Bridgewater believed to have been caused by a gas leak.
there have been no reported injuries at this time.
police say the residents were out of town at the time of the incident.
we 'll have more later on in our broadcast.
Nathan?
Nathan, are you there?
Yes. - Are you okay?
I'm shaken up a bit, but... wait. How'd you know my name?
my name's Frank Burton.
I work for the CIA. - The CIA?
why am I talking to the CIA?
I need to know if you're okay.
am I okay?
I just saw my parents get murdered in front of my eyes.
have you spoken to anyone since the incident?
beside Karen Murphy? - No.
good. Don't talk to anyone. Don't contact anyone.
stay right where you are.
there'll be two men coming to find you shortly.
one's wearing a red flannel shirt.
they're there to help you.
Nathan, you have to trust me.
trust needs to be earned.
Nathan? Nathan?
why am I talking to the CIA?
are you okay? - Am I okay?
I just saw my parents get murdered in front of my eyes.
yeah?
they're at Vassar Brothers Hospital. It's about 10 minutes away.
one of the ER doctors will come check on you soon.
I want the video feeds from every security camera in that hospital.
put this on.
what?
Dr. Bennett? What are you doing here?
there's no time to explain, Nathan. We've gotta get out of here.
put that on. Walk behind me.
cover your face from the cameras.
what do you have to do with all this?
I'm a friend of your father's.
my father was just killed.
I'm talking about your real father.
wait. - What?
Karen.
there's no time. I came for you, Nathan.
I'm not leaving without her.
they're here already.
we're on site. - Where's my surveillance video?
Hey. - Hi.
it's okay. She's my...
doesn't matter. Let's go.
Yeah.
I'm looking for these two teenagers.
my nephew and his girlfriend. They run away.
go fast.
faster.
come on.
left! Take the exit! Go left!
we're in. - Where are you, Nathan?
where is it? - Over here.
I hate balloons.
we've got a hit.
we have a visual on the target.
garage. Second floor.
stop!
target is fleeing. Westbound. Late model silver BMW.
we 're in pursuit. - Stay on him.
sir. - What?
FaceRec got another hit. You should take a look.
you can kiss your pension goodbye, Geri.
Nathan.
there'll be time for you to deal emotionally with all of this, but right now, you have to get your shit together.
who are you really?
agent Brock, target is proceeding south.
I'm one of your keepers, Nathan. I'm put in place to look after you.
just like Mara and Kevin were. They died protecting you.
this is crazy. Call the police or something.
I already tried. I dialed 911 back at the hospital, and some guy came on the line saying he was with the CIA.
Frank Burton. - Burton? I work for him.
what? - Or I did.
he can't be trusted.
there were only four of us who knew your identity.
Mara, Kevin, me and Burton. Two of us are dead.
until I can get in touch with Martin, we have to consider Burton unreliable.
target heading west over the Fourth Street Bridge.
here. 4-3-1 -1 Clarendon Boulevard.
apartment 2. Arlington, Virginia. Memorize the address.
find your way there and just sit tight until someone contacts you.
what? We're just supposed to wait for someone?
it's the arrangement I made with your father in case something like this ever happened.
who is my father? Who were my real parents?
she has heard too much already.
what? - Are you serious?
as soon as you can, dump those clothes.
agent Brock, we 're recalculating the coordinates.
now in less than 20 seconds, we're gonna hit a soft curve just before the bridge.
I'm gonna slow down just enough for you to jump out.
jump? What? - Their field of vision will be obscured.
it's 30 feet down to the river.
Dr. Bennett, this is insane. - Fifteen seconds.
and remember, from now on, do not trust anybody except Martin Price and Paul Rasmus.
I don't even know these people. I need answers.
you've been looking for answers your whole life.
you just didn't know what questions to ask. You can do this, Nathan.
now you have 10 seconds to open that door.
after you jump, I will create a diversion.
I don't know if I can handle this.
five seconds. Leave the girl. You're better off alone.
where am I supposed to go? - Just trust me.
take a breath.
jump! Now! - It's going to be okay.
ready... Jump!
get out of here!
one lousy state trooper? That's all you could get?
don't lose that kid. - We're on it, chief.
come on. Let's go.
all right, we have to get in the river.
what? Why? - Because he'll try and track us.
right here.
watch your feet.
behind here.
was Nathan Price in the vehicle?
I want confirmation!
okay, sit down. Relax.
you stay right here. I'm gonna be right back, okay?
stay.
Hey. Come on.
it's okay.
you were crying in your sleep.
I was dreaming about... - I know.
you don't have to say it.
I have to get you home.
Nathan, I can't go home.
you'll be safe there.
I won't be safe there! We're not safe here!
we're not safe anywhere.
come on. Let's go.
where are we gonna go now? - Just walk.
I can't go back there, Nathan. Don't you understand?
my parents are in Italy. And even if they were home, they can't protect me.
what are we supposed to do? Call 911 again?
look. Whoever these people are, whatever they want, they're after me, not you.
I think they'll leave you alone.
do you really believe that?
or are you thinking about what your therapist said back in the car?
your chances are better alone. - No.
of course not.
it's just, suddenly everyone around me is dying, Karen.
and I don't want anything to happen to you.
we have to stick together, Nathan.
who else are we gonna trust now, except for each other?
come on.
all right, here's the latest intel we have on Martin Price 's current mission.
ten days ago, Martin Price obtained a high-value piece of intel.
specifically, a list of 25 encrypted names,
us politicians and intelligence officers, all of whom had sold state secrets at one time or another.
the list was stolen from this man. Nikola Kozlow.
Ex-Serbian Secret Service. Now, freelance intel broker and operative.
he wants it back. Badly.
yesterday, there was an attack on the residence where Martin's son Nathan lived.
two of our undercover agents were killed.
the attackers were hired guns. Btrava.
connections tracing them all the way back to Nikola Kozlow.
martin Price is the agency's most valuable black ops agent.
keeping his son Nathan safe from Kozlow is our top priority.
how did Kozlow find Martin's son?
we think he discovered the existence of the boy a couple of years ago through a cyber attack.
he's been phishing ever since with fake missing persons websites.
one of his traps finally worked.
Nathan Price is the bargaining chip.
how so?
if Kozlow gets to the kid before we do, he gets the list off Martin.
what do I need to know that you're not telling me?
the boy escaped from us last night with some help from a veteran operative.
geri Bennett.
her vehicle was empty when we got there. No sign of her. No sign of the kids.
Frank.
get this situation under control before things get any messier.
Hey, can you take us to Virginia? - Get in.
it's crunch time, Frank. - Yeah, where the hell is Martin?
last contact we had was the Peshawar drop two days ago.
he's vanished since then.
the fastest he can make it back here... - Is about 36 hours, which is how long we've got to find this kid.
track the girl. Track his friends.
track anyone they've ever spoken to.
put out an alert to all overseas stations. Get a fix on Nikola Kozlow.
if they can't locate him, that means he's probably already here.
so we can add him to our list of headaches as well.
Clarendon Avenue. This is the street.
Hello?
Lorna Price. 1-7-9-3-7 Calvary Road.
what is it?
I know this woman. - Who is she?
I think she's my mother.
this must be Martin Price's apartment.
I'm gonna call my uncle.
let him know I'm still alive.
Hello? - Uncle Danny?
I'm sorry, I must have dialed the wrong number.
Karen? Karen Murphy, is that you?
who is this?
someone who's trying to help you and Nathan.
how do you know my name?
you're in danger, Karen.
there are other people trying to find you.
who is this? - Nathan?
listen to me, Nathan, we're going to find you.
you can't hide from us. For your own safety...
let's go.
kids.
Thanks.
this address could be 15 years old.
you know the chances of finding your mother living there are...
I know. But it's all we have.
this is an odd address. - Look at the numbering.
that's her plot number.
you know what's messed up?
I never knew either one of my mothers.
the one who raised me,
I had no clue who she really was or what she sacrificed for me.
and Lorna Price.
all she was, was a face in a dream.
now she has a name.
but she's still a dead end.
Nathan, maybe she's not a dead end.
these flowers are fresh.
I'll handle this.
hello. - Hi. How can I help you?
my brother and I just came from visiting our mother's grave and we saw that some flowers had been delivered there recently.
is there any way you could check and see who sent them?
we came a really long way to visit her.
couldn't you just help out with this little favor?
okay. What's the name? - Lorna Price.
okay, so the flowers came from Omaha, Nebraska.
a Mr. P. Rasmus.
it looks like it's going to be a longstanding order.
do you have an address for that?
SIGNIT just got a hit on a name Lorna Price.
came from a computer in a place called Calvary Cemetery.
calvary Cemetery.
the CIA is mobilizing a strike team out of Pittsburgh.
Dr. Bennett said we could trust Paul Rasmus.
we have to find him.
you want to drive to Nebraska?
no. We've probably been in this car too long already.
we need to ditch it. - What then?
we'd never even make it through airport security.
they know our names, our faces.
I know. I have another plan.
Tuscarora Pike. Route 15.
you're very close to them.
dude. - Hey, man.
these guys came to my house asking questions.
I had to sneak out back. This is some deep, deep shit.
did you bring what I asked for?
Yeah. three different IDs in three different states.
Yeah, that works. - Karen.
I went through all your Facebook photos.
I chose the one of you from that pep rally last month 'cause I thought you looked really good in it.
but I could use the one from the beach... - These will be fine.
Thanks, Gilly. - Cool.
let's move. We should get going now.
this isn't safe for any of us.
I'm sorry about your parents.
listen, if there's anything else I could do for you, if you need cash or...
we're okay.
see you, Gilly.
Thanks, man. - See you.
tell me when you have him.
Amtrak train 29, the Capitol Limited from Pittsburgh to Omaha is now boarding on track seven.
step this way, please.
thank you. Enjoy your trip. - I will.
capitol Limited, Pittsburgh to Omaha...
is now boarding on track 7. - Go ahead.
have a nice trip. - Once again, Amtrak train 29
now boarding on track 7.
good thing it's only one night.
do you remember that summer when our families were both staying at Canadohta Lake?
after eighth grade.
in the boathouse, we skipped the canoe trip.
Yeah. I remember.
kind of.
when we came back to school that year, how come you never asked me out?
I don't know.
I just thought summer was summer and...
are we gonna die, Nathan?
no.
I won't let that happen.
Wow. - What?
that's better than middle school.
that's 'cause I know what I'm doing now.
and no braces, either.
we should get some food.
Yeah. I'm starving.
I'll go.
okay.
I'll knock twice before keying in.
all right.
I'm on a train, heading south of the city.
very good.
we're coming up on the Cincinnati station.
we'll be waiting at the next stop.
I'm so hungry.
he might like that.
shut up!
tell me what room he's in.
no, no, no.
pretty fingers.
tell me the room. Now.
you're gonna play some more, huh?
you little man.
come on, Nathan! Use your anger.
think about it. Keep control.
come on, Nathan! Do something! You're gonna go down here!
what can you do? Focus.
think about it. Think.
think about it.
come on.
Hey, hey!
watch it.
hold on. I need to catch a breath.
okay.
he really is Martin's fucking kid.
they can't have got very far on foot.
let's round them up. Wrap up this thing.
I didn't get it until now.
all that time spent training, wrestling, sparring.
he was preparing me. For this moment.
a few days ago, we were just a couple of high school kids.
already feels like a lifetime ago.
because it was.
agent Burns, we have a visual on the target.
going south on Route 51.
come on. - Kid!
give it up, kid!
Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!
come on, why are you running?
look around.
is anybody pointing a gun at you?
we're not threatening you.
if you're really the CIA, what's my real name?
Nathan Price.
Steven. Steven Price.
Steven's your middle name.
they argued about it, but your mom thought Nathan was better.
how do you know that? - I was at the hospital the night you were born, Nathan.
what do you want?
I'd like to get out of this dirt, for starters.
you kids, you been on the run for what, 22 hours? Gotta be hungry.
how about I buy you a burger and a milkshake?
you must have been hungry.
Karen, could I have some alone time with Nathan?
agent Burns will help you tend to those bruises.
come sit over here.
you must have a lot of questions.
who killed my parents?
you mean Mara and Kevin? - Yes.
his name is Nikola Kozlow.
he's an independent black ops agent.
like...
like my father? - Yes.
but Kozlow works for the bad guys. Martin is...
was one of us.
the woman you know as Dr. Bennett trained him.
Lorna, too.
whose idea was it to put me in foster care, or whatever you wanna call it?
when your mother died...
to be honest, we weren't sure whether Martin was gonna crack or not.
he was in no condition to raise a child. He realized that.
I told him I would make sure you were safe, so Martin could carry on doing what Martin does.
what exactly is that?
it's a messy world, Nathan.
people like Martin and Kozlow are just two sides of the same coin.
listen, kid.
the world you've just been dropped into is a world very few people get to see.
you're getting a glimpse behind the curtain.
what we're engaged in here is a polite war.
it's not about bullets and bombs, borders or territories.
the currency of this war is information.
zeroes and ones, Nathan.
data. And that's what Kozlow's after.
what does Kozlow want from me?
martin recently stole something very valuable from Kozlow and he wants it back.
if Kozlow gets you, it puts your father in a very compromised position.
why should my father suddenly start caring about me now?
Nathan, you don't know the first thing about your father.
I know he scares the shit out of you.
Mmm.
byers, report. Torres, report.
Torres, report.
this thing that Kozlow wants so badly, what my father stole, what is it?
to the naked eye, it's a sequence of meaningless numbers and letters.
it's actually an encrypted list of 25 people who have sold or traded state secrets.
do you have any idea how valuable that kind of information is, Nathan?
your name's on that list, isn't it?
you have a vivid imagination.
that's a very dangerous thing.
go! Go! Go!
drop!
get down! - Stay down!
get behind something solid.
stay here and keep your heads down.
stay down!
come on.
Nathan? Nathan?
what the hell is going on, Nathan?
my parents' murder, everything we've been through, it's all about a damn list.
what list? - A list of names my father stole.
this guy Kozlow came after me, thinking he'd force my father to give it back.
the crazy part is I've had it all along and didn't even realize it.
it's in the phone I picked up back at the apartment.
martin must have texted it to himself for safe keeping.
Jesus, Nathan why didn't you give it to the CIA?
because Dr. Bennett was right about not trusting Burton.
we're on our own.
Where'd you get that phone?
the guy on the train who attacked us.
Hello?
convenient thing with cell phones, they can be turned into listening devices, as well.
Kozlow. - You have something that belongs to me.
now it's time to give it back.
what use is it to you? Don't be a foolish boy.
hand it over and you'll be left alone.
what kind of guarantee can you give me?
I can guarantee this.
if you don't surrender that list, I will be killing every friend you have.
Jake, Gilly, neighbors.
even your boring teachers.
and when I'm finished, you'll be responsible for the death of every friend you have on Facebook.
but I think it's one person in particular you don't want to see get hurt.
am I right, Nathan? Her parents arrive on Alitalia flight 4-4-9 tomorrow afternoon at 3: 20 p. m.
if I don't have the list by then, they're dead.
you can tell her all about what it's like to lose your parents.
it's a feeling you must know by now. Am I right, Nathan? Or am I right?
okay. Okay. So, how do you propose we do this?
simple. I give you a time and a place.
no. I'll pick the time and place.
somewhere public.
someone backtracked our signal!
let's go, guys!
don't move!
good.
I'm only sorry there weren't more of them there.
Yes, sin another thing.
what? - We found a digital record.
Nathan Harper has the list. - No, no, no!
he's on his way to meet with Kozlow to hand it over.
where?
were you followed? - No, I don't think so.
I took my 80-year-old neighbor's car. Can't you tell it smells in here?
did you do what I asked?
did you? - Yeah, man, just like you said.
patio section. VIP access only. It's under 23D.
Thanks, man. - Good luck.
I wish there was another way.
so do I.
I assure you, I have the situation under control.
do you have the boy?
no.
do you have the list? - No, but...
then you don't have things under control, Frank.
Hello? - Hello, Nathan.
who is this? - It's me.
I need you to turn around and walk out of that stadium, now.
Martin?
you sure have grown.
I know veteran agents who couldn't have handled what you've been through in the past 24 hours.
but you can't go in there. Kozlow will take the list and he will kill you.
not if I kill him first.
you're not ready for that.
I've made it this far, haven't I? - You don't need to do this.
I'm on my way. Just trust me, Nathan. Give me a chance.
you had 15 years, Martin. - Nathan, this is not the time for that.
I'm done waiting. - Right now, you need to hear me out.
Nathan? - The ticket's at the foot of the statue.
ticket. Please have your tickets ready.
Thanks.
well?
where is this kid?
burns, do you have anything yet?
nothing yet, Frank.
where are you, kid?
excuse me.
watch it. Get up. - Hey!
jerk!
popcorn?
I don't understand this game at all, but I like popcorn.
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
what happened? What did I miss?
you got my list?
how do I know you won't kill me once I give it to you?
you don't trust me?
you murdered my parents.
they weren't your real parents.
I can tell you all about your real parents, but I'm not so sure you want to know the truth.
what truth?
martin was, as they call, a Class 5, which means he had the authority to break the Geneva Convention.
to kill women, children, whatever was necessary to accomplish his mission.
but your mother, on the other hand, so loyal.
she wouldn't give up Martin's location even to save her own life.
you killed her.
wasn't my intention.
she was a stubborn woman.
do you remember, Nathan?
you should. You were there, too.
Paris, 1995.
Nathan, think.
it's a funny thing, the human mind.
I'm trained to pay attention to details, from the hair on your neck to the location of every security camera in this stadium.
but in that hotel room, I made one tiny, colossal mistake.
I forgot to check under the bed.
the bed.
Nathan.
go! GO! GO!
is this what you're looking for?
now we have to give me what we agreed upon, right, Nathan?
Hey!
Frank? I have location on Nathan.
where is he? - The seats above the visitors' box.
and moving fast.
excuse me. Sorry!
Hey. - Hey!
Hey!
I'm sorry.
Martin? - You're alive. That's good. Where are you?
in a shop on the upper level.
listen to me. I need you to lead him outside to the south parking lot.
if I do that, I'm dead.
if you stay where you are, you're dead for sure.
lead him outside. Trust me. - Why should I?
because I'm here, Son.
Hey! - Watch it!
come on, Martin.
Nathan!
Nathan!
stop, I'll shoot!
it's over, Nathan.
trust me, Nathan. I'm here, Son.
you're not as good as your father, Nathan.
you sure about that?
Martin!
Nathan? I'll take that.
you're just like your dad, huh?
let's go.
I told you we had the situation under control, sir.
I have it. - Good work. Let me see it.
it's still encrypted, sir. - That's all right.
let me get it to the lab and I'll make sure you have the decrypted file on your desk first thing in the morning.
that's funny.
martin said that would be the first sign.
you talked to Martin? - He said that you'd insist on overseeing decryption yourself, to give you a chance to take your name off the list.
come on, Frank.
we got a long debriefing ahead of us.
let him go.
he's family.
I'm sorry. For everything.
I'll see you soon.
Martin? - Mmm-hmm.
give the phone to my kid, Frank.
he wants to speak to you.
you're very brave, Nathan.
I handled things with Hudson.
you and Karen won't have to worry about the agency from now on.
where are you?
I'm right here. Watching from a distance.
like I always have.
all I ever wanted was to keep you safe. Make sure you didn't get hurt.
but I failed.
I'm sorry, Nathan. I truly am.
when can I see you?
why don't you come out here and talk to me in person?
I'd like that. More than you can imagine.
but it's not possible. - Why not?
I made certain choices a long time ago.
I have to live with the consequences of those choices, but you don't have to.
well, then it's up to me.
I want to meet you.
you don't understand the risk.
I don't care about the risks.
you remind me of your mother.
Martin?
dad?
Nathan.
I'm your father, but I'll never be your dad.
I lost that chance a long time ago.
I don't know if you can understand my reasons.
maybe someday you will.
but you're the only family I have left.
you're leaving me all alone.
you're gonna be all right.
sorry, Son.
goodbye, Nathan.
Nathan.
Dr. Bennett?
Hello, Nathan.
Hi.
call me Geri.
I can't believe you're alive. - Me?
what about you guys?
how are you doing with all of this?
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
it's for your own protection.
I know.
but where do I go from here?
your father wanted me to talk to you about making arrangements for a new home.
nothing can replace Kevin and Mara. - I know that.
but we thought maybe you'd want to consider coming to live with me until you finish high school.
then you have college and...
you know, whatever else you want to pursue.
how does that sound?
Yeah, that sounds good.
okey-dokey. - So, shall we get out of here?
not quite yet.
I'll make sure he gets home all right.
Oh!
I see. Okay. That's cool. I'll just...
you know, I'll be here. - All right.
and, Nathan, about a certain young lady, I was wrong.
you should hold onto her.
Yeah.
she's worth it.
sorry we missed the game.
you can take me to another one.
it's a date.
so, you mean this isn't going to be like eighth grade after the boathouse between us?
you know what the problem was back in eighth grade?
I just wasn't ready for you yet.
Mmm. So I had to wait four years for you to ask me out?
Yeah.
but you gotta admit, it was one pretty exciting first date.
definitely.
Ah!
there you are, Tod. - Shh!
I found one.
no way! Look at the size of that thing.
sure is ugly. - It's a monster!
I can smell its evil breath from here.
no, uh, that's me. I had socks for lunch.
Ugh!
uh, how about you take this one?
come on. We're a team, right? - Wanna shake on it?
shake on it.
ready... set... - Go!
come on, Copper!
Whoa!
come on, keep up!
wait for me!
huh?
Whoa!
we got him now!
ha - ha - ha! We chasing crickets, or are we just hanging out?
I messed up again.
I can't do nothing right. - Hey, that's not true.
you're... you're... You're housetrained, ain't ya?
Oh, Copper.
race ya!
Wow! The trucks for the fair.
I've never seen so much stuff in my life.
Oh, boy! I can't wait.
are you goin'? - I'm - a goin'.
you goin'? - I'm - a goin'.
chief says you can win a ribbon there.
Really? For what? - Just for being a good dog.
Whoa! That's a pretty good pumpkin.
that one's even bigger.
and noisier.
Hey, Tod, do you hear that?
Whoa! Oh!
Oh!
you OK? - Tripped over my own ears.
see? I told ya. I'm just a bad dog.
Ah, don't be like that.
copper! - Uh - oh. Time for my hunting lesson.
Hey, maybe I'll be good at hunting.
Yeah! I'm gonna be the huntingest puppy ever.
now you're talkin'.
let's see now.
copper!
copper! Oh, where did that pup gone off to?
Mm. Hmph!
Hi, Chief. Ready for my lesson.
Oh, darn my hide. Playing nursemaid to a pup when I should be a - practicin' for the contest.
Aw, you don't need to practice.
you're the best hunting dog in the whole county.
well, I reckon it's true. I mean, they don't give those fourth - place prizes to just anybody.
Oh, there you are, Copper. We'll make a hunting dog out of you yet.
here, here. Snuff this up.
now, when this rabbit takes off, you follow his scent.
then when you have him, let loose with a big ol' hound - dog howl!
I must be going deaf. I said howl!
you're gonna lose your head one of these days, Amos Slade.
it's my head, woman!
good boy. Heh - heh.
OK, Chief. Get goin'!
what are you waiting for? Go get him! - Go, Copper!
attaboy, Copper!
Ahh! Pup's as useful as a milk bucket under a bull.
Tod! Oh, I'm getting all turned around.
I don't know what I'm doing.
it's easy. You just sniff him out.
when you smell him, lift up your head and howl.
like this?
no, not me!
uh - oh. - Gotta go!
Ow! Ding - dang it all!
ha! I've got ya now.
come back here, you little varmint!
excuse me. Coming through.
uh - oh.
uh - oh.
my milk! - Oh, no!
Abigail, wait! Amos Slade!
I've gotcha now!
uh - oh.
Amos Slade, I told you to keep your beast away from my Tod!
that mangy hound of yours just cost me a bucket of milk!
your fox was after my chickens, Tweed! What do I care about your milk?
well, as long as you're wasting my milk, you may as well have some pie to go along with it.
what the dickens are you...
bad dog, Copper!
you are a very bad dog!
well, you can just forget about the fair, Copper.
Oh, dag nab it.
you couldn't find a rabbit at a petting zoo on Easter Sunday.
there. That oughta keep you out of trouble.
let's go, Chief. Fair's a - waitin'.
Aw, you'll get it one day, boy.
you just gotta grow up a little, is all.
he got you over a barrel, huh?
well, say something.
there's nothing to say.
it's just what I'm good for nothing.
you're real good at getting into trouble.
course you're good at something, Copper.
we just gotta figure out what.
you know what you need? A little fun.
I wonder if there's a county fair around here.
come to think of it, there is!
in case you haven't noticed, I'm a little tied up right now.
nothing a fox can't fix.
Whoo - hoo!
what do you wanna do first? - Everything.
mom! Fireworks, fireworks!
balloons! Ice cream! Come on!
fireworks. - Oh, yeah.
we've gotta see 'em. - Smack at sundown.
shake on it!
there's that sound again.
sounds pretty good.
sounds like somebody got their tail stuck in a door.
voice like an angel... with looks to match.
Oh, please.
Aah! - Oh!
Oh, my poor...
darn this one - horse, two - bit, free - timing fair!
now, Dixie, it ain't like it smacked your singing. Can we get back to rehearse?
I refuse to work under these conditions.
uh - oh. Here we go. - Well, I'll tell you what, Dixie.
you rehearse, and afterwards I'll give that piece of wood a good old talking - to.
I got two bones on Dixie. - I'll cover that.
it just so happens I am a professional, and my standards...
Oh, now, Dixie, darling, you put on that same old record every day. Ain't it just about wore out by now?
you have some nerve talking to me that way.
if your ear were any more tin, they could can beans with it.
well, you listen to me, Miss Fancy Tail. In a couple of days, we will be in front of that talent scout from the Grand Old Opry.
I get possibly maimed for life, and all you can talk about is the Grand Old Opry?
now, Dixie... - I'll be in my trailer.
darling, we got a show to do. You can't just walk...
...away.
sometimes I dislike that woman.
if they disliked each other any more, they'd have to get hitched.
we're o... - Ooh!
sorry, fellas.
Oh, I can tell right now, this is gonna be the worst show of all time!
it's gonna be the worst!
OK, let's have fun out there!
cash, who will sing Dixie's part? - Just give me a second.
I do a pretty good Dixie. - Waylon, I don't picture you doing Di...
Sit!
OK. Here's the good news.
granny Rose, you are singing Dixie's part.
me? - Oh, she's gonna love this one.
we have a real treat for you now.
Lyle Snotgrass and The Singin' Strays.
you could almost swear them dogs are really singing.
come on, kid. Sing with us.
what?
Yeah!
Oh, yeah. - Thank you. Thank you very much.
hot dog! Listen to 'em, Cash. They love that number.
Yeah, and if a cow had wheels, it'd be a milk truck.
that song is hokey. They're clapping for this little puppy.
well, the kid's cute, all right.
ha - ha - ha! Kid, I'll tell you what.
you can sing! You got pipes of gold.
you sure do!
Hey, kid, what's your name? - Copper.
copper, thanks for getting us out of a tight spot.
it was fun! - You got a future in show business, kid.
you come back and see us in a couple of years, you hear?
Yep, in a couple of years. - 'Cause being in a band takes maturity.
what?
what?
what just happened? - I'll tell you what happened.
you're good at something, and I mean good!
Whoo - hoo!
just what do you think you're doing? - A little audience participation.
that kid wowed 'em. - Kid? What kid?
Bye, Mr. Cash. - That kid.
little critter was heaven - sent. - That sang my lead?
Oh, no. He didn't just sing it.
he sang it.
you don't mean to tell me that wet - behind - the - ears puppy could ever take my place in a band.
I didn't say that. Although he does have that refreshing, blooming youth about him.
just what exactly are you saying? - What do you think I'm saying?
you're saying what I think you're saying. - I think you know what I think I'm saying.
you'd better know that what you're saying isn't what I think you're saying.
why do you always...
only 'cause you never... - What if I said to you...
Ooh! You know, this is just like the time when you...
you better not bring that up.
Hmph! Well, I think we've both been perfectly clear.
Ohh, perfectly.
I quit! - Huh?
cash, what are we gonna do? - She's gone with the wind.
Sit!
I'll take care of this. I'd better. That talent scout will be here any minute.
Hi, there. - Well, who are you?
Olivia Farmer, designated chaperone to Winchell P. Bickerstaff, talent scout from the Grand Old Opry. That's you.
Ahem. Chaperone, huh?
I'm working to get my community service merit badge.
well, that's quite admirable, little lady.
then I'll have more than Sally Ann Merrybaum.
thinks she's so great.
well, lead on, Miss Farmer. I'm a - lookin' for some talent.
Oh, Dixie, you ain't mad over a little joshing, are ya?
I was only teasing you. You know how I feel about you.
Yeah, you have a lousy way of showing it.
I am trying to kiss and make up here.
now, won't you please accept my apology?
blow it out your ear.
all right, you diva dog, but I'm in charge of this band, and ain't no one's indispensable.
you're in charge?
which one of us is in the driver's seat? - Now, listen, you...
now you got me riled.
all right!
Yee - haw! Ride 'em, cowboy, away!
Whoo - hoo! Yee - haw!
all right! This is the most fun ever!
second - most fun ever. - Mr. Cash.
kid, I saw how blissful you looked singing.
that had to be the best time you ever had.
Oh, for sure.
well, now, we can't let nothing in the way of that.
like I was saying, how'd you like to join the band?
Really? Huh? - Yes, sir.
genuine Singin' Stray. What do you say?
Yeah!
copper, we were gonna have some more fun.
well, Tod can be in the band, too, right?
well, uh... - He's my best friend.
can you sing, kid?
uh... - 'Course he can sing. Show him, Tod.
Whoa!
hoo - hoo! Here's the good news:
you're gonna be part of the entourage-y.
what's that? - That's French.
means you get to hang out with our star here, keep him happy.
he does that already.
you know, fetch water, clean dog bowls - fun stuff like that.
that's fun? - Does Granny have fleas?
Aw, come on, Todd. It's gonna be great!
well... OK.
all right, then. Let's get moving.
wasn't he amazing, the way he ate fire, Mr. Bickerstaff?
maybe you shouldn't have stood so close.
now you tell me.
OK. - Hey, Dixie.
you come crawling back. - Oh, by the way, you can't quit.
you're fired. - Oh! What? You can't fire me!
I already quit! Cash, you... Oh!
now you've got me riled.
Ohh!
Ah, don't get your collar in a bunch, Dixie. Pitch a fur ball.
the nerve of that Cash! Where's he get off firing me?
Oh, I thought you quit.
I'm that man's heart and soul! It's plain as a pig on a sofa.
that Cash can talk a dog off a meat truck. He talked me into getting sweet on him, and now he tosses me away like yesterday's cornbread!
honey, I don't blame you for feeling hurt.
hurt? What do you mean by that? You think Cash could hurt me?
mangy mutt.
Oh, you'll howl real good today, fellas.
Oh, well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
Ahem. - No offense.
soup's on! That's a good boy right there!
all right, fellas, all right. Calling out the team.
you know, if I could just play the banjo better, y'all would be eating steaks.
Hey! I guess I'd better go practice.
welcome to the band, kid. Let me do some introductions.
that there is Waylon and Floyd.
they're the, uh, brains of the outfit.
Oh, why I put up with this low - class crew of mutts is beyond me.
uh, and that delicate flower is Granny Rose.
textbook version of growing old gracefully.
I got me an itch.
Yep. You'll never harmonize with a finer group of singing strays and...
uh, you are a stray, right, boy?
uh... - 'Course he's a stray.
you don't see a collar around him, do ya?
well, that's true. - I don't see one.
no collar, no home.
Whoo! Good. Only strays allowed in this dog band.
Tod, I'm not a stray. - Shh!
it'll be our secret.
ha - ha. Just wait till Copper sees this.
another fourth - place ribbon. Ha - ha.
next year, we're going for the three - peat.
Oh! - What the...
widow Tweed. - Hmm?
Oh! Do you make a career out of getting in my way?
step aside, woman. I got a prize - winner coming through.
well, so do I. - What?
this here's a hunting dog. What could you do with a pie?
uh... Oh, yeah. Oh.
woman's got spunk. I'll give her that. Hmph!
OK, fellas, ten minutes till curtain. Let's round 'em up and move 'em out.
move 'em, round 'em.
I'm movin'.
that means you, Copper. - Huh?
Whoa!
good luck, Copper. - Thanks, entourage-y.
say, Tod, while we're on, why don't you spiff up those bowls a little bit?
the bowls? OK, Cash.
don't forget fireworks. Smack at sundown.
it's a promise.
Psst! Little darling.
come on in. Dixie wants to talk to ya.
but I'm supposed to sing now. - Oh, I know, I know.
I just wanted to pass along my secret of success.
Really? Thanks, Miss Dixie.
before every show, take a big ol' helping of that.
peanut butter?
all right, let's get to growling and howling.
now... Granny Rose, go fetch Copper, will you?
Ah, uh... Hang on. Ooh, ah. Oh, that's good.
uh - oh. Bad news in a rhinestone collar.
Oh, why, Cash, you look as nervous as a long - tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.
cause I'm busy as a farmer with one hoe and two rattlesnakes.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm as... as... Oh, I got nothing.
what is it, Dixie? - Oh...
I just thought you could use a lead singer.
peanut butter? But, Copper, you have to sing!
ah - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha!
Oh, hold on, Copper. I'll be right back.
the winner of the milking contest is the Widow Tweed and her fine cow Abigail!
Ohh!
what?
copper! Come on out!
perfect! Just like that!
all right!
Moo! - Ha - ha - ha!
you know darn well that Copper is... - Copper? You mean that little pup?
why, he ran off with that fox friend of his like a bank robber on roller skates.
you're kidding. - Hey, if I'm lying, may my fur lose its natural luster.
that did it! I can sing!
great. When you get out there, don't forget to...
o - O - OK. See you at the fireworks, right?
get used to it... entourage.
this is how it's gonna be from now on. - What do you mean?
while he's off having fun and getting the glory, he'll stick you with the chores.
no, Copper isn't like that.
Yeah. Well, we'll see, won't we?
here I am! Ohh!
huh. Ran off, huh?
sorry, Dix.
peanut butter?
Oh, Dixie. You are through.
well, getting rid of me ain't gonna be so easy, Cash.
Whoa!
that looked easy.
remind me to give that piece of wood a bonus.
look, Miss Farmer, this ain't the kind of talent I'm a-looking for.
Yeah, you're right. That flea circus was totally amateur hour.
Waylon, give me a back beat.
we are headed for the big time, and I got a big-time song to take us there.
follow my lead, kid.
Oh, he's just so darn cute.
Oh, Cash, I'm supposed to meet Tod soon for the...
whoa, whoa, whoa. We can't let nobody hold us back.
we're hound dudes, remember?
Wow. Awesome.
I've never been so high up in my life.
I think I was higher than the fireworks.
Yeah, and how about those free hot dogs?
you looked happier than a hog at Sunday potluck.
all right. Meet you backstage, kid.
we got a lot of work to do. - You got it, Cash.
Oh, sorry, Tod. - Hey, Copper, how's the Ferris wheel?
the fireworks! Oh, gosh, I forgot.
cash and I were busier than two mice in a cheese shop.
too busy for your best friend? - It's not like that, Tod.
cash said I had to let everyone see me.
cash said it's good for the band. Cash said...
cash said, Cash said. Who cares about Cash?
Tod, what's wrong? Are you jealous?
course not, you dumb dog.
then what's eating you? - I don't know.
it's like, you're not around anymore.
well, I'm around now. Let's do something.
I mean, if you wanna.
now?
shake on it? - Shake on it.
kid, I swear you're slow as an iron toad. Come on, you're holding us up. Let's go.
Waylon, would you get up? We got more ground to cover than the Pony Express.
now, let's get to work, hounds!
I guess I gotta go. - But... but, Copper...
I'll see you later, OK?
yeah? Well, maybe you will and maybe you won't!
why eat 'em, Dix? Might as well just slap 'em right on your hips.
come on, Zelda. I need a drink.
give me one straight.
give me that.
Oh, darling. You look like something the cat dragged in.
Ahem. - Oh, no offense.
what do you care? - Oh, come on, Tod.
we're both in the same old briar patch now.
cast off by the one we care about the most.
guess you know how that feels now.
copper's forgotten all about me. - Yeah.
I heard that. Hurts worse than anything. - Yeah.
I remember this one tom cat named Leroy...
I'm talking to the fox.
you see, Tod, relationships and show business, they just don't mix.
Oh, it starts out nice and friendly.
then they get that first taste of fame, and it's look out for number one.
all right, let's get to crooning.
not even a little-bitty bone.
now, that's a good little doggie.
and you know what? He wouldn't even be in that dumb old band if I hadn't lied for him.
come again? - I got Cash to think he was a stray.
copper's no stray. He lives just down the road apiece.
well, darling, all our troubles are over.
how'd you like to get your best friend back?
but how? - Heh - heh - heh.
just listen close to old Dixie here.
whoa, whoa. That last note was flatter than a duck's footprint.
take it from the top, please.
Oh, but, Cash, we've been at it all night.
and we'll be at it all day if that's what it takes.
this ain't just another show.
the scout from the Grand Old Opry is gonna be watching.
take it from the top.
copper. Just what are you doing?
well, it's a cricket. Me and Tod used to...
what is the matter with you, kid? Don't you wanna be a star?
well... sure. - Well, then, why don't you...
cash. He's just a pup.
copper's just having a little fun. You do remember fun, don't you?
OK. All right.
just take five, everyone.
sweetie pie, don't take it to heart.
cash's bark is worse than his bite.
and if he growls at us again, I'm gonna muzzle him myself.
Tod?
Tod.
you in there?
cash, you have seen Tod?
Nope. Dixie ain't around neither.
you were looking for her?
no.
well...
I remember when I first met her.
I was just a little old stray like you, all paws and ears, and felt like a real good-for-nothing.
you? - Yeah.
and then one night, we went a-howling at the moon, and I found out we could sing.
I said, "Dixie, this is our ticket to success. We are gonna be stars."
I guess I'd be stretching it if I said I didn't want her around sometimes.
but we're a couple of hound dudes now, remember?
we can't let old friends get in the way of that, right?
I guess not. - Oh, come on. You're having fun, ain't ya?
ha! Are you kidding?
well, you just wait till we're on top. We are so close, I can smell it.
the Grand Old Opry.
all we gotta do is ace that audition.
right? - Heh - heh - heh. Right.
come on. Let's go rehearse some more. - Attaboy.
copper!
copper!
Oh, where could that pup have gotten off to?
copper!
Tod! Oh, Tod!
widow, what are you doing up this time of night?
Oh, I can't find my Tod anywhere. That pup of yours probably chased him off.
I wouldn't know. I can't find him.
Oh...
well, if I see a sign of your puppy, I'll give you a holler.
I'm obliged. If I see hide or hair of that fox of yours, well...
thank you, Amos.
Tod!
Tod!
Oh, Tod.
copper!
Tod!
Oh, my hair.
Hmph!
Ugh.
broke a nail...
that's where Copper lives. - Nice spread. Could use woman's touch.
you sure this is a good idea?
it's the only way. When Clem Clod - kicker over there gets to the fair and sees Copper, he'll bring him home for sure. You two will get to be friends again, and I will reclaim my rightful place in the spotlight.
hmm. We just gotta figure out how to get them to follow us.
Heh - heh.
that's the easy part. See, old Chief there hates me, but he couldn't catch a cold in winter, and wherever Chief goes, Slade follows.
well, let's see your stuff there, cowboy.
Psst! Chief!
chief!
Oh, that tickles.
huh?
Wha...
Oh! - Ooh, ooh.
Yow!
chief, what the devil...
Tod! - Eh!
it's that darn critter of yours!
my critter? It's your hunt... Oh, my! Oh, dear!
when I get my hands on you...
Tod, I'm coming!
I gotcha in my sight!
you can't get away from me!
I'm a fourth - place winner two times over.
why, you! Come back here!
Ah, Chief, come back!
testing. Testing.
why, Cash, look at you. You're nervous as a flea on dip day.
I haven't seen you like this in a long time. - You ain't never seen me like this, Granny.
I just hope that talent scout fella's in a good mood.
you know, that snake charmer could use a little more practice. Don't you think?
Aah!
Oh! Hey! Hey! Aah!
get the lead out of them boots, Mr. Bickerstaff.
the talent show's just about to start.
Aah!
I know. I'm excited too.
whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ugh! Ugh!
Mm! Blueberries. - Oink!
Aah!
Aah!
here we are, Mr. Bickerstaff. Just in time.
ladies and gentlemen, The Singin' Strays!
coming through! Excuse me! Pardon me!
Tod? - Copper?
chief! - Tod!
copper! That's my dog!
you ain't a stray?
Aah!
Aah!
what in tarnation?
Dixie, what have you done?
where they going? Wait. We can't let 'em leave. We got a show to do. Wait!
that's it! I can't take anymore.
I don't book no circuses!
why, thank you, little lady.
you've been so kind. - Drive careful.
Bye, Mr. Bickerstaff. See ya next year!
Ohh!
what are we gonna do now, Cash?
you're gonna go home.
but the band... - Don't you get it?
you're fired!
you know what? You used to be a lot more fun to be around.
Oh, now, come on. Where are you going?
Hey!
Oh, yeah? Fine! We don't need you, either. Right, boys?
sorry, Cash. - It just ain't no fun anymore.
why does it always rain when things go wrong?
I don't know, Floyd.
happy now?
copper, I'm sorry. I just wanted to...
you ruined everything!
copper!
Attaboy.
let's get outta here.
Oh, Tod. There, there, now.
Oh! Oh!
copper?
Dixie?
what are you doing here?
I just thought you should know that blowing your cover was my idea.
not Tod's.
I guess I just lost sight of what's really important.
and, darling, I'm awful sorry.
he never wanted to hurt you.
he just wanted you to be his friend again.
well, that's what I came to say.
copper?
Hi. - Hi.
are we still friends? - I don't know. Aren't you all mad?
well, I've been thinking, I've been kind of a cabbage head.
if that ain't right, grits ain't groceries.
well, anyway, I sure am sorry.
Yeah, and I'm sorry too.
Hey! I just got a great idea. Hang on.
got something for you.
Thanks, but I didn't get you anything.
no, no. It belongs to the talent scout. I figure you could use it to find him.
you know, if you still want that audition.
how? - You're a real hunting dog, aren't you?
and this here hat is his address.
Yeah, that's it. Get a good whiff.
OK, you get the scout, and I'll go get the band.
Lyle, you fool. There's your problem.
the doohickey is coming out of the whatchamacallit and leaking all over the hoozanozzle.
cash! Cash!
Dixie's in trouble! - What's happened?
what's wrong?
Sit!
where is she? - Follow me.
all right, that'll do it. All right, fellas. We are off to...
uh...
fellas?
Waylon? Cash?
anybody?
huh?
doh!
huh? Huh?
well, where is she? - Uh...
um...
huh?
Thataway!
come on, everyone! Follow me!
copper, where's Dixie?
she'll be along.
cash!
way to go, Copper!
cash, are you all right? - No, no, are you all right? I'm...
I'm fine.
what in tarnation... I thought you were in trouble.
just exactly why did you get us all together?
cause... 'cause...
cause that's how it oughta be.
like the words in the song.
like the sun and blue skies. Um...
like summer nights. And fireflies.
like an itch. - And a scratch.
well, ain't somebody gonna sing?
gosh, I missed you.
ha! Ha - ha - ha - ha!
Whoo - hoo!
well, bravo! I finally found my act!
yahoo!
you all gonna be stars!
Whoo - whoo!
there you fellas are!
are these here talented canines yours? - Yes, yes, sir.
we've got to talk. Come over here, son.
well, there you go, Cash. You just got what you always wanted.
well, maybe I had it all along.
well, what are you saying? - Well, what do you think I'm saying?
well, you'd better be saying what I think you're saying.
I think you know what I'm saying is what you think I'm saying.
well, I thought you'd never ask.
now, there's the good news.
somebody smack me. I must be dreaming.
we got a little old barn called the Grand Old Opry I'd kinda like to show you.
Yes, yes, sir. That sounds great. That would be fantastic.
Tod!
Tod! - Huh?
Tod!
copper?
but the band... Aren't you doing with them?
can't. You and me... we got crickets to chase.
and if I ever forget that again, you just kick me in my walkin'-awayin'.
shake on it? - Shake on it.
Hey!
Aah!
huh?
Oh! - Wait for me!
now, everybody take a bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow.
a NOON Entertainment Production starring LEE Byung-Heon
lee Eun-Ju
excuse me, can I share your umbrella to the bus stop over there?
Oh no! You're soaked!
I'm all right.
come closer under the umbrella.
here comes the bus!
thank you!
198381
so nothing happened afterwards?
you idiot...
so what did you do while you walked her to the bus?
you should've at least asked what school she goes to?
you're right...
what did I always tell you?
be fully prepared at all times!
prepare what?
having all the expressions and lines to cope with every situation.
just like this... You dummy.
she came right up to you and wanted you to take her,
you should've taken advantage of it.
Hey!
don't waste your time here.
go to the military and become a real man.
see you later.
I'm submitting my temporary absence form today.
are you serious? - Really?
since this term already started, you should at least finish it first.
what's the point if I have to go to the military anyway.
I want to get it over with fast so I can date chicks afterwards.
chicks!
who are you kidding?
you think some chick would date someone like you?
I don't know. - Watch it...
what's wrong?
what are you looking at?
some of you made both sides look identical.
in reality, you know that our bodies are not totally symmetrical.
touch the person's face next to you.
how is it?
leaves on ceramics of the Chosun Dynasty roughly look the same, but if you look carefully, one side is in three parts, and the other side is divided into four parts.
this is perfect symmetry.
now then. Let's begin.
excuse me.
what are you doing here?
Yes...?
I came because I wanted to see.
to see?
not because you wanted to listen?
Oh, you mean you came to show your appreciation for art, right?
well, I'm glad.
take a look.
that student's face over there has perfect symmetry.
his face is full of expressions.
before you start molding, look at his face for reference.
kim Ji-Su. - Here.
suh In-Woo.
here. - Here.
suh In-Woo.
is he absent again? - I'm sorry.
tell him not to come anymore.
he failed this class.
excuse me... - Yes?
can you cut this wood for us? - Oh, sure.
you're doing great! - He sure is!
you stupid lumberjack.
what are you trying to prove?
you think sawing like an idiot has anything to do with your major?
Oh yean
you said you didn't believe in love at first sight.
Yeah, I said that.
I think he was right.
if you say I fell in love at first sight, it means I want to sleep with you.
that's what that bastard wants.
I bet when you first saw her at the bus stop you got a hard on, right?
how could you walk when it was stiff, huh?
to be honest, she's not that pretty.
her tits looked as small as upside down spoons.
hey In-Woo!
did he get upset because of me?
look!
isn't he scary?
so that's why he kept looking out the window.
late bloomers are the scariest.
Hey, did you know?
I gave you some magic.
when you grab something, lift up your pinky like this.
I just came to tell you that.
Hey, that guy hasn't showed up lately.
you're right.
you think he gave up because I was too cold?
it's really because of me. --Thank you.
you know, I haven't seen that guy lately neither.
you miss him too? - Huh?
you know what I mean.
when I eat rice rolls, I pick out every carrot.
since my mom takes out the carrots now,
I feel really empty.
so you mean...
that guy is... -- Carrots, of course.
Hey, it's raining.
it's pouring hard. I didn't bring an umbrella.
I brought one.
the news forecasted showers for this afternoon.
you're always so organized.
Hey!
In-Woo will probably be here, right?
well, I told him, but he seems busy lately writing his report.
there he is!
where? - In-Woo!
Hey!
looks like your loyalty stayed alive till the end.
hurry up! How much food did you bring?
what's he doing? -- I don't know.
Hey.
I think he's going with that other group.
what's In-Woo doing over there?
because he's crazy!
he picks that chick over his friends.
Hey, you call that a friend?
then are you being his friend now?
Hey!
what happens if I jump down?
probably die.
it doesn't seem dangerous.
come here and look. --I'll look for myself.
In-Woo.
I wanna go to New Zealand.
new Zealand? - -Yeah.
I heard people jump off a cliff there.
you want to jump too? - -Yeah.
even if I jump, it won't end there.
okay, let's die together.
it's too safe to die. - -Then let's jump together.
you can't die. -- Let's jump together and die.
you're serious, right? - -Whoa, that was scary.
come here. -- No, that's okay.
come see! -- Let's go back.
come here and look.
watch this.
on this side, your face is backwards.
but on the other side, it looks straight.
did you know that?
huh? You're right. -- Cool, huh?
is it because of the surface?
Oh yeah, your major is Korean language, right?
Yeah. Why?
chopsticks in Korean is "jutgarak."
and spoon in Korean is "sudgarak." - -Right.
but why does "sudgarak" have a "d" in it?
huh?
it makes sense if there's another word that's spelled with "sud," but in the dictionary, all I found was "sudgarak."
anyway, both consonants are pronounced the same, and "sudgarak" can be spelled with a "t" too.
Oh, right...
boy... l'm hungry.
so? Why is that?
it's simple...
since you grab the "jutgarak" like this, it's spelled with a "t."
and a "sudgarak" is used to scoop so it's spelled with a "d."
since it looks like an upside-down "d..."
you're not a Korean language major.
I'm right, huh?
hey... I learn about that my senior year.
what?
eat this one instead.
Thanks.
it's delicious.
I got it!
there's another word spelled with "sud."
yeah? What is it? -- Sudsticks.
to Tae-Hee who taught me that there's love in the world.
this song is requested by SUH In-Woo.
when did you request it? "When I fall in love.
to be honest...
love at first sight.
committed to everlasting love.
I used to think these sayings were dumb.
I did to.
when I saw you for the first time,
I knew we would fall in love.
nice lighter.
is this you?
Yeah. -- Wow! It looks just like you.
while I was getting ready for college,
I made this to give it to the man I fall in love with.
honestly, I went on a lot of dates and was proposed to, but I was reluctant to give it to them.
because after I break up with them,
I wasn't sure if I could get it back.
but now...
I'm not reluctant at all.
I'm worried about one thing, though.
what?
I've never seen you smoke before.
no, I smoke.
I didn't smoke in front of you because I thought you hated it.
Really?
no, I like guys that smoke fashionably.
Oh yeah?
then I should've smoked all along.
anyway, this is a great lighter.
it looks just like you.
okay.
breathe it in slowly.
good.
now take a deep breath and spit it out.
do it slowly.
you dummy...
Hey, are you all right?
by the way...
how do you smoke fashionably?
teach me that.
fashionably?
okay, check this out...
wow...
is that the most fashionable? -- Cool, isn't it?
do this at a date, and the girl will instantly fall for you.
do you think this is really necessary?
Yeah, do you have to do this?
you really don't have to.
I have to.
hey...
did you... Did you do it with her?
come on...
Tae-Hee can only be your girl if you sleep with her.
stop it... -- Shut up!
these days girls aren't what you think.
if a girl's too easy, then she's not the right girl.
that's why you should do it naturally, stupid.
you can't be straightforward and say I want to screw you.
just do this.
tell Tae-Hee that you have something important to say.
then since it's cold... - -Hey, you think I'm stupid?
I know that much already.
but our relationship isn't like that.
anyway, are things going well with that girl?
who?
you saw her? Isn't she pretty?
please make it last this time.
I get so excited when I see her.
so then?
what?
so what happens after I say something important?
you little... -- Come on, tell me.
so ask her if she wants to go somewhere warm.
then take her to a motel.
say you need to take a shower since you're sweaty.
why am I sweaty if it's cold?
every guy sweats by then idiot.
sorry.
take a taxi home.
wait!
Tae-Hee!
you'll catch a cold. You're too far from home.
what's wrong?
you don't want to share my umbrella?
Hey!
then you take it.
okay!
I won't go with you so take it!
No!
I don't want to use your umbrella.
what?
what did you say?
you didn't hear me?
I said I don't want to use your umbrella.
I don't even want to see it.
you still can't hear me? Want me to repeat it?
I can repeat it ten times if you like.
your umbrella...
thank you.
thanks for not leaving.
I thought a lot over on my way back.
don't leave Tae-Hee.
please stay for me.
I'll do whatever you want.
are you copying me?
huh? What?
I've thought over a lot too standing here.
In-Woo.
come back.
if you come back,
I'll do whatever you want from now on.
Tae-Hee, your... - -Oh...
I used this umbrella when I first met you.
did you know that?
Yeah, I did.
you did?
Yeah, I did.
then how come you were so mean before?
sorry.
watch this.
how did it get like this?
I want to sleep with you.
me, too.
let's go here.
this one?
let's stop wandering around and go here.
sorry.
it's closed.
here to rest for a bit, right? - Sorry?
I said are you here to rest?
just for a little bit... -= Five thousand won.
Oh, it's wet.
I'll hang it...
sit down. --Yeah..
what's wrong with me?
do you want some water? - No, I'll get it.
it's not working.
it'll be all right.
do you... -- What?
do you wanna watch TV?
not really.
okay.
In-Woo. -- Yeah?
come here, it's warmer.
no, it's cold here too. I mean it's warm here too.
okay...
what?
there's not much time left.
you must get hiccups when you're nervous.
or is it when you get excited?
don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be right here.
I'll never leave.
of course I'll go with you.
just in case I'm late, you better wait for me, okay?
you scared me.
so who's our homeroom teacher?
I heard he's a math teacher.
Really? - Nice.
as long as he's not a phys ed teacher.
hey it's Hae-Joo. See guys later.
what a bastard...
hey Hyun-Bin! Come back here!
200031
what is this? - Scribble!
it's the earth.
stick a small needle somewhere into the earth, and a grain of wheat falls from the top of the sky.
the probability of that falling seed to stick to the needle's top...
through this immeasurable probability, you are all here.
among the earth's many countries, there is Korea.
and within Seoul, there is Saeyon High School.
and from that the sophomore class.
and finally there is class five.
and through this unbelievable probability, you've met everyone in this class, and the same goes for me.
this... ...is what we call destiny.
destiny is scary, isn't it?
for the next grueling year, I'll be your homeroom teacher.
since I'm also your language teacher, you'll be sick of me.
my name is SUH In-Woo.
I don't need to write it down, right?
because I know later on, you'll call me names like prick and jerk.
no way.
just once.
someone has the same name as this wrestling champ.
lee Bong-Gul.
yes?
right, Bong-Gul.
you will be today's class monitor. Start the class.
go Bong-Gul!
attention. -- Louder.
attention! -- Louder!
attention! -- Good!
bow! - -Good morning!
did you get one too? - -Yeah.
let me see. -- Yours is pretty too.
mine is a couples phone.
hey Sae-Young! - What's that?
he applied for it under his name and pays for all my phone bills.
Really?
and me?
I have to pay for it?
here!
I don't want it.
you don't even know yet. -- What is it?
after you put it on, you have to show it to me.
okay?
let's open it.
Yes!
watch, she'll come soon.
one, two...
Hey! Are you crazy? Do you all wanna die?
what the hell is this?
you don't know? It's a bra.
I wrapped it with panties too.
you think I'd wear something like this?
no.
not at all.
I intentionally bought the biggest size.
I told you before. Put it on and show it to me.
it's big enough to slip off...
Hae-Joo!
I think she's really pissed off.
did I overdo it?
don't you think it'll be pretty on her?
stop imagining it. Stop it.
attention! Bow!
good morning!
so did all your girlfriends get candies?
no, sir. -- Yes, sir.
tell us about your first love! - -Come on, tell us!
first love! First love!
I don't remember. Let's begin class, okay?
come on!
how come?
did your first love marry another guy?
how did you meet her?
tell us. - -Come on, tell us teacher.
tell us.
I fell in love at first sight. On one rainy day.
come on, that's a lie.
isn't that just a line to pick up girls?
you're right, it's a lie.
love at first sight.
it means you're only attracted to her face and body.
so what?
but you can't fall deeply in love at any moment.
it's by realizing who that person is.
your partner for life.
just like me and Hae-Joo.
hey you! Hey you bastards!
stop right there, you pricks!
damn it.
you!
it's named after a crane...
hey you!
you think you have the right to come in whenever you want?
is being cool everything?
sit down and open your book.
excuse me for one moment, teacher.
there's that little bastard!
come here you prick.
you can't stop stealing, huh? -- What's going on here?
a couple of kids stole some cigarettes.
cigarettes?
that's what this kid did. -- Did you see him take it?
don't you know that shit stinks before you smell it?
I caught him several times before last year.
he needs to be expelled!
let go of him. - But teacher!
is this true Wook-Gi?
answer me! Did you steal it?
look at him! He can't even answer.
if I tell you, will you believe me?
you won't trust me anyway.
just expel me. - Watch your mouth!
look how rude he is.
Wook-Gi...
did you steal it?
no.
I can't believe this prick!
he said he didn't.
come on, teacher. - It isn't him.
does he really have a bad habit?
I didn't know.
teacher! -- But...
this student doesn't lie.
I know for sure. -- I can't believe this.
if he's really lying, I'll take full responsibility.
you heard what he said before!
we're in the middle of class. Please leave.
that bastard's lying!
you better tell the truth you prick!
I can't believe this!
so where were we?
I was a weak crybaby when I was young.
so a lot of bad things happened to me.
but my teacher trusted me and took my side every time.
just like I do for you.
I'll always trust you.
don't betray me! -- Yes, sir!
go in! Go in!
I had to leave cause my mom was going to kill me.
but he kept asking me to go out with him on a date.
what? - Oh, nothing.
so what next? -- What is it?
no, it's just that I like basketball. He got the ball.
shoot! Goal!
im Hyun-Bin? - SHIN Young-Ho?
you...! - You...!
I can't believe you!
you little liar.
we lost. -- I'm so tired I'm about to die.
Hey, Sung-Chul! Watch out!
I trust you. Don't betray me.
you bastard.
Hey, by the way, wasn't our homeroom teacher awesome?
Hey, that doesn't sound like you.
he's like a real teacher. -- You're right.
Oh, Young-Ho!
let's go back in.
we've got music class. -- Let's go.
I'm sick of that class.
Mr. Suh. - Yes?
what were you looking at so long?
the kids looked cute playing.
cute?
you still haven't felt their wrath yet.
I can't stand them anymore.
you don't have class? -- Yes, I do.
...if we hit them, it's sexual assault.
they shouldn't dress like that in the first place...
are you following me?
I thought you were following me.
Oh yeah! Your magic really worked.
look. I'm still sticking out my pinky.
and thanks for sharing the umbrella.
you remember? Oh, you remember.
then why didn't you... -- I pretended not to.
because I wanted to be careful.
if I told you I remembered, I thought it wouldn't be special.
I didn't want that to happen.
do you know how to waltz?
I'm learning it in class lately.
the guy's left foot comes forward, and the girl's right foot goes backward.
okay, let's try it.
one, to the right... Two, three, and backwards.
one, two, three.
your hand is cold.
my hands are usually cold since I have a warm heart.
I see...
it's easy, isn't it? -- Yeah...
now let's step farther. Here we go.
Domino: Heads, you live.
tails, you die.
[echoing] Tails, you die.
my name is Domino Harvey.
my name is Domino Harvey.
I am a bounty hunter.
what I say over the next several hours will determine whether or not I spend the rest of my life in prison.
[Echoes]Tails, you die.
miss Harvey, my name is Taryn Mills.
I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI.
I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Domino: Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say, "Not until I speak with my attorney."
I'll tell you everything I know.
36 hours ago, $10 million was stolen from an armoured car that was subsequently found abandoned at the Hoover Dam.
the driver's name was Locus Fender.
we know that he was in on the heist.
[Echoes] We know that he was in on the heist.
is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves and then deliver them to Drake Bishop, owner of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino?
Yes.
you then learned where the thieves had hidden the money.
and at the instructions of your employer, went to retrieve the money yourself.
we were sent out to the Fender Compound in the desert near the chicken ranch.
this way.
all right, on my go.
watch your ass on this one.
go.
Aaaah!
SiC 'em, boy! Sic'em!
fuck!
chi Chi?
Domino: That's my bestfriend.
his name is Choco. He's always fancied me, but too shy to ever do anything about it.
chi Chi!
Edna, Chi Chi's in doggie hell.
all we want is the money.
Domino: That's Ed Moseby, the most legendary bounty hunter in all of Los Angeles.
he's my boss, my mentor, the father I never had.
chi Chi!
Oh, my poor Chi Chi!
the Manchurian Candidate, eh, Edna?
is that you, Domino?
nice to see you, darling.
your father must be so proud of what's become of his little angel.
listen, bitch, we've got your son!
if you don't give us the money, we're gonna wax his fucking ass!
you don't have shit!
Hey, Choco.
show her.
Aaaaah!
he's still alive, Edna!
prove it!
Choco, go get him.
Anne Robinson: Last question for ? 20.
start the clock. Zack, in anatomy, a human being is usually born with howmany toes?
we got to show Edna her son.
Domino: That's our driver Alf.
he's from Afghanistan.
he once ate a cat.
we can't understand how to pronounce his fucking name, so we just call him the cat eating alien.
what does that mean?
shut the fuck up.
how did Locus Fender lose his arm?
he had the combination to the safe tattooed on it.
locus: Mama! Mama!
Locus!
mama. Mama.
baby, I'm here!
please. Please.
you got to do as I say.
now, the combination is on my arm.
mama, you got to get the decoder.
please, Mama.
put your weapon down!
Putit down, Mama!
put your fucking weapon down!
Domino: Time to start at the beginning.
time to start at the beginning.
ed, echoing: I'm the boss.
Choco: I'm already a cool mother fucker, you know?
man: I employ bounty hunters.
woman: I'm here today to speak for all the women of mixed race in America.
woman: I'm sorry?
woman: I will knock you out! Number one!
man: Where's my money?
man: I fuckin' love that show.
man: Maybe one of you will survive.
locus: Now, Mama!
put your fucking weapon down!
you got 10 minutes to open that safe, Edna.
fuck you!
Domino: I've never killed anyone.
I hope to never kill anyone, even if they deserve it.
my agenda is to kick ass and secure the bounty.
if I'm on this side of the law, I can live the low life and avoid jail.
I can live the nasty and not do time for it.
that's called the best of both worlds.
as for that other world, that 90210 world, it's not for me.
is that him?
is that your dad?
Domino: My real father was an actor.
he died when I was a little girl.
Hi, Ben.
what the hell are you doing? What's the matter with you?
Heh. I knew Frank.
who didn't?
Hey, Edna...
you know what, sweetheart? You got, like, 7 minutes to open that goddamn freezer, or I'm gonna flush that fucking arm down the toilet.
fucker!
Domino: You're probably wondering how a girl like me arrived here, at the arse end of the Nevada Desert with a blood. Spattered Winnebago and a one. Armed man.
the Department of Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles.
his name is Frances.
mr 90210 college boy had found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Hey, yeah, what's up?
OK.
um, look, I said, um, they're about to call my number, like, any second.
now, are you in, or are you out?
OK. Make up your fucking mind, 'cause they're about to call my number.
right now, 'cause they're about to call my fucking number.
all right.
we're on.
PA: Now serving G086.
Hey. Um...
kee Kee?
um, Kee Kee said that you could deliver the IDs tonight.
Lateesha... I need that web link.
the J Lo concertis probably sold out already.
kee Kee don't make the rules.
listen...
bitch...
I don't think you understand who the fuck you're dealing with here.
OK? Because I could make your job disappear like that.
kee Kee said tonight.
tonight, 8pm.
anything else?
Nope.
good. Bye, Frances.
good. Bye, Lateesha.
Fuck'em.
Fuck'em all.
Domino: Lateesha, Frances, and the 4 fake IDs is where it all went wrong.
Where's the money?
I don't know.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
I think you're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself, and it's not going to work.
this is your last chance. Once I walk out that door, I can't help you.
Domino: When I was a little girl, my father told me thatif you weren't careful, you could lose everything you've ever earned in life in a splitsecond.
you have to know when to cash out.
thank you.
man: He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.
neither will mourning nor out cry nor pain be any more.
the former things have passed away.
and, look...
I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.
Domino: After Dad passed on, my mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.
Hello, Mr Stevens. How are you?
good holidays? Absolutely. Thank you.
darling. I love you, love you.
Bye. Got to go, got to go. Bye.
Domino: She decided to sock me and my goldfish Sammy away in boarding school.
a week later, sammy died.
it was a pivotal moment in my life.
I decided to never invest too much emotion in one thing.
it's always a set. Up to the pain of losing them.
Domino: God created me in his image.
Domino: I guess he had a thing for models.
[echoing] I guess he had a thing for models.
like most models, I was bored with life.
I hated everything and everyone.
Domino: If you think America is dirtbag central, clearly you've never been to the sleaze nation of our Queen Mother.
Wogan: I hope all this is not gonna change you.
one thing we'd like to change, though... You said lan's name wrong.
right, it's "eye. an." lan Ziering, not"ee. an" Ziering.
it's "eye. an," since birth.
brilliant... Absolutely brilliant.
Domino: Mum was determined to move us to Beverly Hills.
that damn show started it all.
[Echoing]That damn show started it all.
she remarried to a man named Mark Waldman.
he invested in a restaurant called the Hard Rock Cafe.
Domino, Domino, give the goddamn numchucks a rest already.
it's time for supper. Come on, baby.
Domino: I tried Beverly Hills High for a spell, butit didn't work out.
I hated them. I hated them all.
all: 5, 6, 7, 8! We are Alpha Omega we are the AOPs, uh. Huh...
Domino: College was even worse. Mum convinced me to join a sorority.
it was all fun and games at first.
then the hazing started.
this is fucking disgusting! [Laughter]
disgusting! [Crowd cheering]
Llook at these mosquito bites.
what's it like to have the body of a 10 year. Old boy?
crowd: Ohh...
have you had a nose job? No.
Domino: A week later, I was expelled.
