locklear has assumed leadership of the pacific command as the u.s. is placing a greater emphasis on the asia-pacific.
locklear pointed to two rotational deployments-sending marines to australia and navy littoral combat ships to singapore-as examples of how the u.s. planned to boost its engagement in the region without building more bases or otherwise installing infrastructure.
locklear said the issue reached an important milestone when chinese president hu jintao and u.s. president barack obama met last year and agreed to see if the two sides could find places where their interests converge, and understand better where their respective interests diverge.
locklear, 47, was one of the biggest stars of the original melrose place when she played a blond vixen whom viewers either rooted for or rued.
locklear, who most recently was commander of nato-led operations that helped libyan rebels overthrow moammar gadhafi, has made maturing bilateral military relations one of pacific command's five basic priorities.
