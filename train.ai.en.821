it's the worst odds in town. - Good to know.
all right, we've accounted for all the passengers in the kill car except for two.
they're in the wind. - Any word on the mom?
Yeah, she's out of surgery. She's going to be fine.
I just got a call. 419 in... Brim county?
Brime. - Brime. Brime.
so, probably a two-person job. What do you think?
what do I think? You're the boss.
I think you should stop asking me what I think.
I'm glad we got that out of the way.
I'll take it. I haven't been to Brim county in a while.
I just heard "Brime." Wh...?
take Saunders with you.
Sanders. - Sanders.
ricochet? - Yeah.
all right. Thanks a lot.
camper found him. No I. D.
did you see the look on Nick's face on the tram when he saw Russell just lying there?
awesome.
yesterday, Russell put on a murder victim's watch, but he kept asking me for the time.
and so finally I was like, "Russell, what time is it?
and he just looked at his watch and walked away.
he did catch that Gig harbor killer.
maybe it works for him.
do you want to lie down on the ground and play dead or should I?
no sign of animal activity.
now, the coroner said that he had puncture wound in his belly.
so where's the blood?
EW, never seen that before.
face of a Jonas brother, body of my grandpa Pete.
shirt's stretched out. Incremental tears.
most of the buttons missing.
ripped off during the scuffle?
now we just need to find our primary.
Hey, the casino's all over my ass about this tram.
they want their tram back pronto.
no people mover, no money in their pockets.
so I told them it was your call. So what's it going to be, D.B?
okay, let's wrap it up.
but we haven't even collected all the blood yet.
Yeah, exactly. Let's wrap it up to go.
what, you want to take the whole tram back to the CSI lab? The whole thing?
Why? Where would you take it? Excuse me just a second.
Oh, too many bubbles.
Yeah, I'm at the hospital now. I got to run.
Hey, Albert, thanks for coming in, man.
you know, the ER doc looks like...
I've got some questions about the mom's wounds.
well, it's a pleasure to be here.
somebody alive is a nice change. - Yeah.
Hey, hear anything about Ray Langston?
Yeah. Gloria's doing well, so he's doing well.
Baltimore's proven to be a potent medicinal for both of them.
Medicinal?
you call being railroaded by IA therapeutic?
a serial killer is dead. The world's a better place, right?
Jim, Ray's back with the woman he loves.
he's got a second chance.
I think killing Haskell may have saved his life.
before she blacked out, she told the paramedics she felt paralysis in her legs.
the gunshot didn't do that.
well, something on that tram did.
well, this is strange. - What?
a puncture of some kind. Needle mark? Bug bite?
that's a hell of a big bug.
here you go. I think this is yours, isn't it, pal?
secret seal, right?
boy, I loves me some secret seal.
say, who's your favorite character on there?
okay, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna leave it right here till you're ready for it.
Yeah, you're doing great, bud.
Hey, Nick. Have you seen my tennis ball anywhere?
you know, the invisible one?
um... No, I,uh, I haven't seen it.
Oh, for goodness' sakes, it's right here.
God, I love these things.
still got it.
see if you can get one by me. - Yeah.
Oh, you're gonna play that way, are you?
whoop, Emmett, heads up.
Where'd you get it?
that was, uh... Target, yeah. On sale.
you can keep it if you want. - Thanks.
you're welcome.
listen, I-I know it's hard, but Emmett...
if you can tell us anything you saw on the tram, it would be very helpful.
it's okay if you can't remember anything.
I saw an alien.
big one, or... A little one?
little one.
was it by itself?
okay.
got an id on our cowboy.
robert Mundler. Tolleson, Arizona.
in town for the gun show.
and he decides to start his own.
I recovered a bullet from his chest.
it severed the ascending aorta.
sent it off to ballistics, came back a . 357.
well, it's the same caliber as the two we collected from the mom.
confirms that our security guard got off at least three shots.
so, who ruined Mr. Finnerty's night?
the cowboy or security guard?
neither. He had other complications.
he was suffering from advanced Mesothelioma.
the lungs are encased by a dense, fibrotic mass.
tumors infiltrated the ribs and intercostal muscles.
how much time did he have?
three months at best. Mercifully cut short by sharp-force trauma, transecting his liver.
wait a minute. He wasn't shot?
Nope. Another crime, another assailant.
somebody brought a knife to a gun fight.
okay. So in 73 seconds, we have a gunfight and a guy getting stabbed.
Yeah, and don't forget about mom's bug bite.
what the hell didn't happen on this ride?
okay, all right. Let's start with what we know. Go ahead.
red strings are the security guard's.
he saw the cowboy draw his gun.
got off three shots.
two shots missed and hit the mom;
the third kills the cowboy.
how'd our cowboy do at the rodeo?
well, the green strings are his.
he returns fire. One shot was a total miss, hitting the window.
and then the other one went through the security guard, and kind of just takes a tour of the tram.
and the bullet goes... Up and ricochets.
Oh. Sorry. Hold that thought.
could be my wife.
Hey, honey. Uh... well, I'll ask.
my wife's calling about a farmers market.
you, you guys have those here, right?
um, you know what? I'm going to have to call you back.
all right. Explain this to me:
if the stabbing victim, Tom Finnerty, is standing right here, in the middle of the crossfire, how come he's not Swiss cheese?
well, he must have gone down before the shooting started.
I'll buy that.
Yeah, and don't forget about the slime.
Yeah, all right. So the...
the slime path goes over the Mai Tai, which means the slime event came later in the ride.
did someone say "slime"?
actually, uh, what you're looking at is a concentrated mixture of mucus, Tyrosinase, Lysine and Sodium Chloride. Meaning...
meaning... there was an octopus on board.
a Cephalopod Mollusk, technically.
uh, how'd you know?
the kid said he saw an alien.
and we found saltwater trace in the slime.
not sure how the alien part factors into the equation.
all right. Look.
slime path heads towards the door, right?
what if our ricochet left the scene?
I think that our 'pod got winged.
well, it's all perfectly logical, except for one thing.
what's an octopus doing on a Vegas tram?
what do you make of the Shar-pei chest? Exposure?
it's more like the skin was stretched.
that's odd.
connective tissues separated from the Subcutaneous fat.
falls right off the muscle.
dark residue along the Stratum Germinativum it's curious.
just got results back from Shar-pei's shirt and pants.
found traces of "Bambi blood.
you know, he had GSR on his hand.
maybe he was a hunter.
that doesn't look like a knife.
barely penetrated the skin.
wait a sec. This... is so incredible.
I think I know what happened. I gotta make a call.
thanks for the heads-up, Catherine.
Nicky, I'm sorry.
there's just been a hell of a lot going on around here.
new boss needed an office; I gave him yours, I'm sorry.
you know he's growing 'shrooms in there, right?
they're supposed to be medicinal. - Medicinal?
don't get me started.
this is great. Ray Langston screws up, and we all gotta pay for it.
awesome. This is really fair.
Hey, guys. - Morgan.
good to see you.
um, that's my phone. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Morgan. Good to see you. How's it going?
you know... it's going.
you're not leaving?
no, no. I'm just, uh, moving offices, I guess.
I heard about Langston. - Yeah. Yeah.
so what are you doing here?
I'm due for a little Vegas action.
Oh, well... All the action's at the strip, it's not around here.
Hey, Greg. Come here, I want you to meet somebody.
morgan Brody, this is Greg Sanders.
Greg was our L. A. expert on the Haskell case.
Oh, right! Great work. Good to put a face with the name.
you don't look like a history nerd.
neither do you.
I mean the nerd part. Not that you are a nerd.
or that there's anything wrong with being a nerd.
right.
I'll catch you guys later. - Yeah.
that's Ecklie's daughter?
dude, don't even think about it, I'm telling you.
I finally found him under the tracks at the Palermo station.
hmm, good shape, considering.
I do love a good "octopsy.
Hodges, please. - Sorry.
cod is... hearts failure.
they have three.
looks like the bullet perforated the bronchial hearts and lodged right in the oxygenating heart.
four, five, six. Right twist. Nine mil.
consistent with the cowboy's Beretta.
Oh, my. Looks like human tissue on the beak.
I think he bit somebody.
somebody's mother. That would explain Mrs. Drake's paralysis.
got something you like?
I do. Look at our missing couple.
look at the tattoo: Vintage diving helmet.
japanese woman. Octopus.
tentacle erotica.
ancient Japanese secret. Men will pay money to watch women...
Oh, come on.
eight times the pleasure, eight times the fun.
I don't get it. So... red dress had octopus on a leash?
no. No, as a matter of fact... in her purse.
purse looks full going in, empty coming out.
let me, uh... let me ask you something real quick.
I'm kind of new in town.
do you know any good Shokushu goukan parlors?
SeaWorld's closed.
so you want to tell me about your little tram ride adventure last night?
I wasn't on a tram. I was in a tub.
so, that's not you fleeing a crime scene?
I didn't feel like getting shot.
no, who does? I don't feel like getting shot.
you know, I've always wondered. What do you feed those guys?
crayfish, mostly.
Claude actually had a thing for shrimp.
he was fussy.
but he was worth it.
so Claude was on the tram?
I'm sorry for your loss.
so you found Claude? - Forget about Claude. Okay?
let's talk about the guy with the knife in his gut.
look, I had nothing to do with that.
Oh, well, maybe your boyfriend did.
boyfriend?
you mean the psycho with the blade?
look, one second he's drooling all over me, shoving a room key in my...
next second, he's got a knife out.
like magic.
I'll show you a magic room...
the poor guy in the baseball Jersey.
do you still have that hotel key?
that depends on what you're gonna charge me with.
we're gonna charge you with...
Wh-What?
do you want to see Claude again? - Yes.
I can make that happen, but we'll need to see that hotel key. Okay?
okay.
the room's registered to Tom Finnerty.
the victim? - Yeah.
Las Vegas police. Open up.
got the knife.
suicide.
am I dead?
I swear to God, I didn't kill my brother.
Tom was my brother. I'd never hurt my b...
why would I hurt my brother?
you do know that we found the murder weapon in your hotel room, right?
with your fingerprints all over it?
look, man, my brother only had a few months left.
he was dying of lung cancer, so...
I was giving him a make-a-wish weekend.
it says here, Jimmy, that you served two years in juvie for auto theft, and two in Ely for assault, and that you're currently out on parole from Corcoran for another assault.
and do you know that it's a violation of your parole to be in Vegas?
all that's true, except the part about killing Tom.
I don't even know how it happened.
we were heading to the tram.
and I see this hot Asian chick in a tight red dress...
Tom catches up to me and, uh, he's got this friggin' knife sticking out of him, and so I pulled it out.
then the guy in the cowboy hat started shooting.
Tommy was dying.
um... Nothing I could do.
well, if I really loved my brother, I would have stayed with him.
I wouldn't have just left him alone to die like that.
you're right.
Tommy deserved better.
a lot better.
this is embarrassing. Sorry.
here you go. Why don't you take that?
I'll tell you what. Why don't we back up and tell me how this whole day started, all right?
it was a 51's game, right?
we, um... we both played in high school, and...
Tommy was a hell of a first baseman.
Yeah, I played in college little bit. I wasn't very good.
what about you? Were you any good?
he's not playing good cop right now, is he?
no. That's what I'm talking about.
they all think they're social workers.
they are good, though.
Yeah, but that's not the point.
I know. I know.
medication, and, uh...
I like Nick.
I'd hate to lose him.
Oh, hey, I uh, ran into Morgan Brody today. She's really...
what are you watching, Greg?
norwegian YouTube.
so, our Shar-pei Doe got me thinking.
he's a deer hunter, right?
like a long line of Sanders men.
don't worry, the bucks stop with me.
but meet my cousin Jerker from Nesoddtangen.
he's got this deer-skinning technique that uses an air compressor to separate the skin from the muscle.
that is disgusting.
well, that also might be our COD.
our Vic had a puncture wound in his torso.
I'm thinking he was "hulked.
you mean like inflated.
it's possible. Probably take one big-ass air compressor.
you know, you and your cousin Jerker may be on to something.
it's Jerker.
the trace report on the black residue we found on our deer hater... Polyalphaolefin.
it's a lubricating oil.
it also kind of sounds Norwegian.
it's found in commercial air compressors, like the ones they use in truck stops to fill big rig tires.
and I think there's a truck stop a few Miles from our crime scene.
your jacket is impressive.
so, uh, what was it this time?
I think you know.
Langston fallout...
it had a far reach.
there are hundreds of other crime labs in this country.
this one's the best.
it's your call.
Hey, Nick.
let me talk to you for a second.
Yeah, sure.
look, I don't know how things were done before I got here, and I like to think of myself as an easygoing kind of guy.
I like it that way.
but when I ask for something, I expect to get it.
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm still working on my field investigation report.
I don't see a pen in your hand.
all right, man, I'll give you the report, but it's not gonna have the right answers in it.
it's a start. It's a form of communication, and I shouldn't have to chase you down here to get it.
Yeah, you're right. It won't happen again.
Oh, it probably will.
Hey, college baseball, huh?
Yeah, how'd you know that?
well, I watched you get all cozy with our suspect.
why don't we talk about the tram ride, instead?
I was a pretty lousy baseball player.
I think that'd be a good idea.
okay, 73 seconds station to station.
and in that time frame, Tom Finnerty is stabbed.
we assume the cowboy sees Jimmy with the knife, Pulls out his gun.
security guard sees that, pulls out his.
bullets start flying.
both the security guard and the cowboy get hit.
and the mom's collateral damage.
now, that part is in my report.
I'm glad to hear that.
okay. So we know what they did.
we don't need them anymore.
Adios, folks.
that leaves the stabbing.
but now, you don't think that your best friend Jimmy did it.
red dress said Jimmy stabbed his brother.
Jimmy said he was only trying to pull the knife out.
personally, I think that she probably saw the knife in Jimmy's hand and just filled in the rest.
okay, I'll buy it.
red dress can go.
you're Jimmy.
Yeah, and I see my brother with a knife sticking out of his gut.
I got to help him.
so, I run over.
I go to pull the knife out, and that's when all hell breaks loose.
the shooting starts as the tram pulls to a stop.
self-preservation kicks in.
as I'm running out...
I deposit two blood drops on the door here from the knife.
and we know that that's tom's blood. - Yeah.
hang on now, wait a second.
there's a third blood drop here, and it's different than the others.
come take a look at this.
looks like they were all deposited at the same time.
but this droplet has a ghost ring.
blood drops dry from the outside in.
it takes at least 30 seconds to form a ghost ring.
if this blood came off the knife as Jimmy was running out, there wouldn't have been enough time to form a ring.
73 seconds is plenty of time.
and the only way that could have happened if it was on the door before the tram ride even started.
I don't think there's any way my old pal Jimmy could have done this.
well done, Nick.
we're still looking for a killer.
well, we do have a witness with the best seat in the house.
Oh, yeah, we do, don't we?
Emmett, you're doing great.
okay, so you sat down.
tram started to fill up.
I'm the guy in the 51's Jersey.
come walking on.
then what?
did you see anyone try to hurt him?
no.
did anyone bump into him?
no.
all right, uh... what...
Oh, Emmett, what are you doing, buddy? Where you going?
you all right? What's going on?
I did something bad when I was going to the tram.
Oh, okay. Well, I-I bet it wasn't that bad.
some money fell out of a man's pocket.
it was right... right here on the floor.
I took it.
okay.
can you look for him and give it back? - Sure.
why don't you give it to me, Emmett?
and I'll make sure it gets back to its rightful owner, okay?
now let me ask you something.
did that belong to the man in the 51's Jersey?
no. He was smaller.
smaller. All right.
well... Well, when people help the police, they always get a reward.
so I'm gonna make sure that you get a brand-new one- hundred-dollar bill. All right?
and right now, I want you to go over, and that nice lady... she's gonna buy you an ice-cream cone.
all right?
if this blood's Tom Finnerty's, he was definitely stabbed before he got on that tram.
but he couldn't have been stabbed on the platform here or in the casino, or we would've seen that on the surveillance cameras.
you know, I'm thinking they don't have surveillance in bathrooms.
Oh, yeah.
I think we just found where Tom Finnerty was stabbed.
it's quite an operation you run, Mr. Gibbs.
service over 30 trucks a day.
found this picture on your wall.
who's your hunting pal?
have you seen Del lately?
think he's on a fishing trip.
nice air compressor.
who has the key? - Me.
you forgot to clean it.
tested positive for human blood.
I got a feeling that the DNA will be a match to Del. How about you?
when you were cleaning up, you missed a button.
it was an accident. I swear.
we had a deer come to.
it happens.
del tried to restrain it, but he forgot that the deer had a weapon.
the deer was carrying?
Yeah. Ten points.
Del, I'm gonna pop some holes in here.
del gets cut, and he's worried about rabies or-or deer worm or something.
he grabs the nozzle to clean the wound.
seemed to make sense.
Oh, God!
it got stuck with the nozzle on.
air's blowing in his body, his body's popping off his muscles.
and I yank the thing out, and he's dead.
he was my friend, but I got a... a business.
I can't have dead bodies lying around.
and, uh, it was... It was out of season.
I think poaching is probably the least of your problems right now.
Yeah.
DNA confirms that the blood on the money as well as the stall door was Tom Finnerty's.
and I went through the ID logs from all of the Palermo's ATMs.
at 12: 53 a. m. our bloody hundred was spit out from Tom's account.
that was right before he got on the tram.
hold on a second.
all right. Print came back to an Allen Krick.
why do I know that guy?
because I talked to him. He was in the next tram car.
Krick is in the wind.
the address he gave is bogus.
we're checking the hotels now.
I found an interesting connection between Krick and Jimmy Finnerty.
they were partners in crime.
they were busted in a chop shop scam in Tahoe in '07.
Krick got two to five, Jimmy got the hell out of town.
took the money and ran.
of course he couldn't stay out of trouble.
when did Krick get out?
he was paroled from NCC five days ago.
thank you.
I'm sorry, but NCC? What...?
it's the correctional facility in Carson city. - Okay.
which is exactly where his day started out yesterday.
we were able to obtain krick's phone records.
he had a long day, made quite the drive.
Carson city at noon.
Yerington by 2: 00.
now, that's when he first called Jimmy.
went straight to voice mail.
about 4: 00, he was in Hawthorne.
and then by 5: 00, he was all the way down in Indian Springs.
called again and straight to voice mail.
now, the last hit was at a cell phone tower on Flamingo road.
that's just four blocks from the Golden Nugget.
where Jimmy was staying. - Right.
he drives all that way, but when Krick finally gets here, he kills the brother.
Why?
what are you looking at? The Big Dipper?
the last thing Tom Finnerty saw before he died: His brother.
let me, let me try this.
okay, so...
head rush.
Tom's dying of cancer, and yet he flies 3, 000 Miles to be with his screwup brother.
he gets stabbed, and he walks another 300 feet just so he can be with him at the end.
so, where does Krick fit into all this walking?
Jimmy pulls a knife out of Tom trying to save his life, and Tom pulls cash out of an ATM to try to save Jimmy.
I'm with her. Where's this going?
krick's phone records, right? Follow it all the way through.
all day long, from Carson city to Vegas, Krick's calling Jimmy, right?
over and over, getting closer. Obviously, he wants something.
that's why he's at the Palermo, why he's shadowing Jimmy.
but-but tom is with Jimmy.
and what did Jimmy tell you about-about big brother?
that he spent a lifetime looking out for little brother.
Yeah. See, I think Tom saw Krick first.
and given Jimmy's past, you got to figure little bro owes krick big money.
so, tom gets money out of the atm, and when Jimmy's distracted by a hot red dress, he follows Krick into the men's room.
Hey, look, let me make this all go away.
I don't need your money.
I need the last five years of my life back.
you stay out of it. This is between Jimmy and me!
now it's between you and me.
bitch, get out of the way!
he was trying to clean up another one of my messes.
what about krick? You know where he is?
I'm not telling you that.
I roll, he rolls, I do serious time. I'm not, I'm not doing that again.
okay, so you're gonna cover for the guy who killed your brother.
who died stepping up for you.
don't you think it's time you stepped up for him just a little bit here?
krick's got a girl in Boulder city.
Thanks.
thank you, Emmett. That was a really good thing you did.
make sure you spend it all in one place now.
you like basketball? - Yeah.
well, I got a, I got a boy, little bigger than you.
plays college ball here.
maybe the next time you and your mom are in town, we could go to a game together.
you like that?
okay.
brass picked up Krick.
genius still had the blood money on him.
that's real smart.
Yeah, I called Jimmy's probation officer.
tried to get him to cut Jimmy a little slack.
this will be his third strike.
call him back.
what do you mean?
I mean that we are doing things by the book now.
what book, Catherine? I'm just trying to help the guy out.
you're not listening, Nick.
there are no more under-the-table deals, no more going rogue, no more personal vendettas, no more L. A.
now, what does this have to do with L. A?
I wouldn't change anything about what I did there.
I would!
I'm not in charge anymore, because this is our problem.
we lead with our hearts instead of our heads. And then we justify it after the fact.
why you so pissed off?
I got demoted, Nick!
I got demoted!
I mean, you're setting up shop here in the break room, and D. B.Moonbeam is running the show.
and you know what, maybe he's just what this team needed.
I disagree. It's not what this team needed, it's what Ecklie and the sheriff...
Hey, sweetheart, I'm just leaving.
how was your day?
stop with the excuses.
don't give me that, Catherine!
think the team is really starting to...
well, you can add me to that list.
starting to gel.
honey, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna go.
I need another hour. I'm sorry.
19 years is a very long time to be doing this job.
what are you trying to say?
what am I trying to say?
well, I'm saying that this team has to move on.
we got to get back to what we do best.
and if you can't handle that, then, you know, there's the door.
I know where the door is. I've used it a couple times.
breakfast on me Russell
what if someone sees us?
please, this place is like a ghost town.
well, what about God?
he sees everything.
well, I mean, if he has a problem with it, he'll let us know, right?
uh, you're, um... - What?
there's, uh... You're covered in...
is it really...? - Blood?
Yeah.
excuse me.
so, I talked to Kid Casanova.
he tells me that God's wrath rained down.
you know, you lose the blood and the police tape, my wife could really go for a neighborhood like this.
very eco-friendly.
not so friendly tonight.
the Chambliss family. Quadruple homicide.
you're gonna need backup.
you get many "Stigmata" houses in Seattle?
no, no, our saints bleed coffee up there.
the owner was a pharmaceutical salesman. Laid off six months ago.
okay, thank you. I got it.
well, I hope Moonbeam brought his booties and a strong stomach.
lining up for the next play, Al.
that'll make it second down and a loss of five on the play.
second down and 15...
greenhouse gray water system.
recycles everything that goes down the drain.
and out to the sprinklers.
explains why the house was bleeding.
look at this.
when was the last time you bought a rainbow marshmallow?
when my daughter was eight.
Oh, God.
do you feel that?
change in temperature.
there's no blood on her pajamas.
she's been redressed. Cleaned up, tucked in.
by somebody who cared about her.
this was where she was shot.
what's blood doing way up there?
wait here till you get the Code Four.
got someone over here.
show me your hands! Get down on your knees!
get down on your knees!
sounds like a Code Four to me.
let me see your hands! Get down on the ground!
get down on the ground!
let me see those hands!
get him down! Get him on the ground!
get on the ground!
do not resist!
cuff him up.
cuff him. Get him out of here! ?
you are going the wrong way.
make a U-turn at the next intersection.
intersection?
you are going the wrong way.
there's no road!
you are going the wrong way.
recalculating.
you have arrived at your destination.
your dad teach you how to drive?
funny.
you guys could use a few more freeways around here.
who's inside?
me and Greg.
you want to take the perimeter?
I got my sunscreen.
Ah, there you go.
Oh, speak of the devil, there's the old man there.
enjoy yourself.
Hey, Conrad, how you doing? - Nick.
good to see ya.
cigars? Kills the decomp.
I always had a few on hand.
so, uh, you settling in? - Yeah.
you make an appearance at every crime scene?
I usually roll on anything over a double.
and this one, press is gonna be all over it.
I got stuff to do.
Undersheriff Ecklie!
is it true you have a suspect in custody?
can you tell us if you have any leads?
can you tell us if you have a suspect?
look, look, all I can say is we have a person of interest in custody and that we intend to question him.
is there any additional information you can share with the press?
as a matter of due diligence, we're performing a thorough search of the neighborhood, including one of the neighboring homes.
uh, don't mean to interrupt your search, but, uh, I've torn this place apart... there's no gun, no knife...
did you notice the decor?
you in the market for a decorator?
the kid's 27 years old.
he answers phones at a body shop.
yet all the furniture in this place looks like it belongs to his parents.
like hand-me-downs.
the only room that reflects his taste is this one, and it's laid out exactly like... like the dead little girl's room.
even has the same dollhouse.
not exactly the same.
guy lived just across the way.
he's been watching her for years.
I got boot prints. - Me, too.
mine have been here a while.
I think somebody made a habit out of hiding back here.
Yeah. Looking in.
just got a text from Catherine.
our perp is a peeper.
can I get you anything?
want a soda, something?
cherry cola would be nice.
I'm sure it would.
I know what you think.
you're just lucky I'm a cop.
I'm CSI Willows here to process you.
get up.
step on the paper.
strip.
just pretend she's an eight-year-old girl.
pants next.
could you close the blinds?
better?
keep going.
three in the van. Still waiting on the mom.
Thanks, David.
any reason you're holding her?
I need her in context.
there's a lot of blood spatter here.
there's a lot of blood in this house, period.
all this had to have taken a lot of time.
grandmother was stabbed a dozen times; the father was shot three times.
guy has a knife and a gun.
so why does he need the towel bar?
you really think one person could've done all this?
cadets are outside beating the bushes looking for the knife and the gun.
they're having the same luck that we did.
I've seen this freezer before.
my wife and I once went away for a weekend, and we left our eldest in charge.
God help us, so the kids did all the shopping.
when we came back, the freezer looked just like this.
popsicles, ice cream.
it's a great way to lure a kid.
Yeah. You know, not a lure, more like a... a lifestyle.
arrested development.
you think John Lee likes little girls because he's a little boy?
immature, isolated.
you know, he hides, takes pictures through windows.
I'm passive, I'm not aggressive.
I thought you liked to play dead, get into the head of the victim.
you know, it depends... you know, you walk into a room, the victim, suspect.
I go with whoever has the best story to tell.
what story is this guy telling you?
I don't know yet.
but I'm not so sure that it ends in a quadruple homicide.
Oh, whoa, you don't think the man-boy did it?
he was in their house, he... was holding the little girl's nightgown, he watched her for years.
Yeah, exactly. For years. Thank you, yeah.
and all of a sudden one night he stops watching and he starts killing?
Why?
right hand.
is it gonna hurt?
a lot less than jabbing a towel bar into a woman 20 times.
I didn't do it. Any of it.
I went by the house. I looked in and I saw her.
she was already dead.
the blood.
I loved her.
I couldn't leave her there like that.
other hand.
you know, I ran you... you had no record, no complaints.
but here's what I think happened.
I think you were hanging out by that window peeping, and someone saw you, told the Chamblisses...
dad didn't like that.
so he walked across the street to your house, knocked on your door, then knocked on your head.
and you didn't like that.
I tested your hands for lead to determine if you fired a gun.
and guess what color positive is?
you shot that little girl.
you shot her father, sliced and diced her grandmother, and stabbed and beat her mother with a towel bar.
and we're gonna prove it, too.
so you got a choice...you can spend the rest of your life in general pop with a bunch of gangsters and killers who never get to see their kids, they're gonna take it out on you in a heavy way, or you can tell us what you did... and maybe buy yourself a private cell...
what's it gonna be?
I did it.
I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
good afternoon.
I'm Undersheriff Ecklie of the Los Vegas Police Department.
I'm here to announce that, thanks to the fine efforts of our detectives and CSI's, we have a suspect in custody who has confessed to the murders of the Chambliss family.
can you tell us his name?
why did he do it? How did he it?
I have no further comment at this time.
I am saying there has been a mistake.
I saw the news... that sheriff...
ma'am, slow... down.
don't patronize me.
I have information about the Chambliss murders.
I need to talk to somebody in charge.
that would be Captain Brass.
you arrested the wrong man!
Really?
and you would know that how?
I know because I did it.
I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
so... Leslie, uh...
G- I- T- I- G. People always get it wrong.
well, we're gonna get everything right today, Leslie.
how do you know the Chambliss family?
Calvin Chambliss and I were having an affair.
he promised he'd leave his wife Susan for me.
I guess that didn't work out.
he caved. He told Susan about me.
bitch.
and then he stopped calling.
you can check my phone records.
Oh, we're gonna do that.
so, where were you last night between 9: 00 and midnight?
where I always am... parked outside their house.
you can check the traffic cameras.
Oh, and I stopped for gas.
so you got out of your car? - Yes.
then what? - I rang the doorbell.
Cal's mother, Anita, answered the door. I told her I was there to see Cal.
she wouldn't let me in, so I killed her.
and then I killed Cal... and Susan... and Fiona.
Yeah, I read the paper, too.
tell us something the whole world doesn't know, Ms. Guy- tig.
you mean like Anita's throat was slashed.
Cal was shot twice in the chest, once between the eyes.
and Susan was stabbed repeatedly.
Oh, and little Fiona... was shot in the head.
so, you said you entered the house through the front door?
if you want to videotape this, I can start again from the beginning.
I heard about the second confession.
one is good; two is bad.
nut job or not, she's just made things a lot more difficult for us, creating reasonable doubt.
so... where would you like to start?
let's start with Mom.
massive head trauma. Exsanguination.
24 sharp-force injuries consistent with the jagged ends of the towel bar.
15 accompanying blunt-force injuries consistent with its rounded sides.
beaten and stabbed to death.
39 blows.
towel bar ripped from the wall.
rage.
dear old Dad's a different story.
david found these blue fibers on Dad's clothing.
could be the shooter.
contact wound right through the frontal bone, execution style.
clean and quick.
rounds look like nine-mill.
same as little girl.
I'm not sure I want to hear this, but... sexual assault?
there was nothing.
no physical findings of any sexual abuse.
he escalates to murder but leaves the object of his perversion untouched?
then he just kills her?
doesn't make sense.
good first day?
Yeah. Finished processing outside, and I'm starting on the blood inside.
great, great. Walk with me.
family meeting. Everybody.
let's go.
is he for real?
Hey, looks good, Greg.
so, this is how I like to run a family meeting.
clarify the problem first, okay?
and we have two competing stories in this case.
who thinks that, uh, the target of this attack was the little girl?
raise your hands.
okay. Never mind.
point of entry. The window?
all right, okay, all right.
here comes the birdbath. Smash!
what's the little girl do?
I, uh, found a puddle of urine under the bed. She must have hid there.
all right. Nick, you processed the dad.
could he have heard all of this?
evidence tells me no. He barely got off the sofa before he was shot.
TV was on... he might have been asleep.
and Grandma wears a hearing aid, so she probably didn't hear anything.
flour on the kitchen floor indicates Mom was baking a cake.
mixer's on. That's pretty loud.
okay, so maybe nobody hears the window break.
but that's crazy.
you know, if someone breaks in to my daughter's bedroom, first she yells bloody hell, then she wouldn't hide, she'd run to me.
little girl's behavior is off.
everybody's behavior's off on this thing.
Oh, by the way, Catherine called and said John Lee did not touch the girl sexually.
so I'm glad to see none of you raised your hands when I asked if she was the source of this whole thing.
in that case, I'd like to retract my hand-raise from earlier.
girl's behavior is more consistent with point of entry at the front door.
then she ran and hid.
but there was no evidence of forced entry at the front door.
dad's on the sofa, Mom's in the kitchen...
and Grandma had to let them in.
grandma was first, Dad was second, Mom was third, stabbed and then dragged into the bathroom.
Fiona was last.
but if John Lee didn't assault her... - Why did he kill her?
well, maybe he didn't, now. Maybe he came in after the killings.
he breaks in, throws the birdbath through the window, and then, like he says, he changes her clothes.
it would explain why we haven't found any bloody clothes, or a gun, or a knife at his house.
somebody else killed this family.
I wore gloves.
I always keep a pair in my car.
disposable.
disposable?
Where'd you dispose of the gun, the knife, the clothes you wore?
I threw them away.
where?
I disposed of my Beretta in the water hazard off the 12th hole at the Alsted Country Club.
I drive by there every day on my way to the firm.
I find it peaceful.
is that it?
just like she said. 12th hole water hazard.
swan took a bite out of the diver.
I'm surprised you let someone else go in after it.
you know how those Navy Seals are.
they make us Marines take a back seat.
Yeah.
well, bullets are in evidence.
when you're done, make sure Russell gets your report?
got it.
best job in the world.
get to play with guns.
nobody's shooting back.
print of John Lee's boot.
here you go.
great.
individual characteristics line up.
boots match.
got him at the window.
but not in the house.
he gained two sizes coming in.
Russell was right.
nice hand retraction... brown nose.
fire in the hole.
where are the other gentlemen?
if you're going to ask me the questions now, that red light isn't on.
you know what a ballistics match is, right?
Yes.
well, the gun you had us fish out at the country club was not the murder weapon.
the caliber was the same, but the rifling wasn't even close.
as I understand it, any number of things can change a gun's rifling characteristics.
like shoving a screwdriver down the barrel.
are you going back to the lake?
obviously, you found the wrong gun.
you... are a... legal secretary, right?
you seem like you'd be really good at that job.
I mean, you know criminal procedure, you got the lingo down.
I bet you even have contacts at PD, or maybe the coroner's office, or the crime lab.
I killed that family.
do you want to know why I did it?
cause that bitch got in the way of me and Cal.
which is why I sunk that knife into her 24 times.
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.
um... be right back.
don't- Don't go anywhere, though.
Oh, brother, she's a piece of work.
and she's, what, like, 105 pounds soaking wet?
and I don't think she owns work boots.
not men's size 12, anyway.
it was a towel rod, not a knife.
I ran her phone logs.
she's been making calls to law enforcement all over the county.
she got a look at our evidence.
you know, she may be crazy, but she figured out point-of-entry before we did.
maybe we should keep that to ourselves.
Yeah. John Lee dressed yet?
I would hope so. Why? - Guy's a peeper.
and if he didn't murder that family, maybe he saw who did.
so, John, we know you were in the house that night, in Fiona's room.
now you said that...
that she was already dead.
let's say we believe your first version.
you were still there.
did you see anything?
no.
well, maybe not the night of the murders, but come on, buddy.
you've been watching that family for years.
you trying to trick me?
no. No, no, no, no.
John, you loved Fiona.
loved her.
and something horrible happened to her.
she would want you to help us.
have you ever seen this woman?
red BMW.
three Series.
she would park down the street and just sit there.
she's an awful woman.
how do you know? - You can just tell sometimes.
did this awful woman ever go inside?
did you ever see any other awful people go inside?
can I have that cherry cola now?
explain this to me.
some perv stalks your daughter, peeks in her window, takes photos for years.
mother doesn't work, father is unemployed.
I mean, they were around.
you can't tell me they didn't know.
I found dozens of footprints outside that window.
so why didn't they call the police?
maybe they couldn't.
did you get a look inside that garage?
porsche still has dealer plates, new Volvo wagon.
money.
dad was laid off.
Where'd it come from?
in L. A., at least 70% of all murders are related to drugs.
well, that might explain what I recovered from the kitchen.
finally got a chance to process everything.
I don't think Mom was just baking cakes.
that is a lot of baking soda.
and one seriously accurate scale.
either mom was OCD, or she was cutting powder.
cocaine?
maybe meth.
well, we didn't find any drugs in that house.
because we weren't looking for them.
I'll drive.
I know the way.
what are you doing?
my hand looks like Gorbachev's head.
I was out in the field whacking the weeds for weaponry...
you know better than to handle evidence without gloves.
when I dropped my gloves.
and when I went down to pick them up,
I put my hand in some very un-eco-friendly battery acid.
why'd you drop your gloves?
you know, they really shouldn't even let you out of the lab.
may I cite you in my Workmen's Comp case?
how about citing your results from the blue fibers Super Dave found on Mr. Chambliss, instead?
lucky for you, I can work through the pain.
your blue fibers... denim.
of the phylum Levis.
so jeans.
almost.
just as you'll never get the chance to run Grave, these never got the chance to be pants.
how much pain do you want to have to work through, Hodges?
please turn to page two.
the fibers were saturated in borate... fire retardant.
Jean companies will pulp their cutting-room scraps and sell them for insulating materials.
which is used in green construction.
so how does insulation end up on Dad?
well, maybe he was doing some sort of home improvement?
or maybe the killer works construction.
you don't have to be mean about it.
Morgan, Greg, get in here.
this is the exact layout of John Lee's bedroom, except he didn't have one of these.
Yeah, and the electrical panel's in the garage.
good call, Hollywood.
I love it when I'm right.
we searched the house, John.
we know about the drugs.
so these awful people that went into the house...
is it that what they came for?
they let strange men sit on her bed.
made her sit out in the hallway.
one time, she forgot her doll.
tried to come back in and get it.
her dad yelled at her.
she cried.
he yelled a lot.
did he ever yell at anybody else?
got a hit... multiple arrests for drug possession.
John, you saw something happen in that house.
you saw someone arguing with Fiona's dad. Who?
John, is this the guy?
did you ever see this man, John?
Yes.
in Fiona's bedroom?
Yes.
Yes, a lot.
get out of here.
where you going, dude?
yo, I didn't do nothing!
Yeah, pat him down good, Mitch.
Lonny, this looks bad.
Yeah, this looks worse.
Lonny Gallows, you're under arrest.
possession for sales of a controlled substance.
well, you're in a lot more trouble than that, bud.
Hey, what are you doing with my son?
arresting him for murder.
my son didn't kill anyone.
sir, stay out of this now. You don't want to interfere with a police investigation.
those boots are mine.
so are the gloves.
arrest me. I did it.
I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family.
you got to be kidding me.
you understand lying to a police officer is a crime.
I'm not lying. - Really?
I got your file.
you know, Mr. Gallows, you've never done anything wrong in your life.
you're a family man, you own your own business, you're doing well.
you're the only guy in construction that I know who's making money.
then you massacre a family?
I want to make a deal.
I'm not making a deal with you because I don't believe you.
I did it. - Listen, listen, we know your son's a drug addict.
he was high when we busted him and it's pretty safe to assume he was high a couple of nights ago when he committed these crimes.
we found his prints all over the cash and drugs in the Chambliss house.
that's how we know he was running drugs for Cal Chambliss.
I get it... you want to protect your kid.
I did protect my kid by killing that family.
Lonny got clean in rehab.
I tried to keep him clean, I put him on my crew building green houses...
same damn houses in Cal Chambliss' neighborhood.
so that's how they met.
it's my fault, my mistake.
here's how I correct it.
you drop the drug charges on Lonny... and I'll tell you everything.
well, thanks to Maurice Gallows' confession, Leslie Gitig just got sprung, and our perv John Lee just made bail.
I'm telling you, it pays to have rich parents.
I don't see the dad doing it.
no, no, man, he's taking the rap for his son.
okay, so Lonny's dealing drugs for Chambliss, gets hooked, starts dipping into his boss' supply.
Cal cuts him off, and Lonny just decides to gets even.
great, so our only viable suspect is the one person who hasn't confessed to the crime.
any thoughts?
Yeah.
who killed Cock Robin?
those shrooms in your office aren't medicinal, are they?
I," said the Sparrow.
with my bow and arrow, I killed Cock Robin.
who saw him die?
"I," said the Fly."With my little eye, I saw him die."
I," said the Fish,"I," said...
Oh, come on.
all right, forget folk songs.
uh, crime novels.
strangers on a Train.
Yeah, I saw the movie. What's, what's your point?
the p... Nick, when you were hooking up Lonny, what did his father say...
exact words?
he said,"I did it, I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family."
"I," said John Lee,"I did it, I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family."
"I," said Leslie Gitig,"I did it, I'm the one who killed the Chambliss family."
now, that's three confessions, all identical.
hell of a coincidence.
so it's like they got their stories straight.
they were working together.
strangers on a Train.
total strangers get together to commit a crime, figuring the cops won't make the connection.
and each one of them had motive to do harm to someone in that family.
and each had reason to confess.
by all confessing, they muddied the water.
there is no perfect crime, but if you create enough reasonable doubt, you might just have the perfect defense.
and that's something a legal secretary would know.
now, how do we get around reasonable doubt?
find the train.
all right, thank you.
so I just spoke with the owner of Benson's Auto Body.
two weeks ago, Leslie Gitig paid him $4, 500.
Benson's Auto Body?
that's where John Lee works. - Could be where they met.
Leslie's BMW was in an accident and she didn't want to run it through her insurance.
she paid cash, but not just for her repair but for the truck that she plowed into.
truck, what kind of truck?
I don't know, the driver hasn't brought it in yet.
maybe 'cause he needed it for work.
I saw a couple of thousand dollars worth of damage to Maurice Gallows' truck.
all right, well, sounds like we need to take a look at that truck, compare the damage to Leslie's car.
I'll take the truck.
Greg and I'll take the Beemer.
2-4, Victor 2-4. Come in.
nice job matching the color.
well, yeah, to the naked eye anyway.
Yep, left-side damage.
I'll call for a warrant.
3- David-34. Shots fired.
request backup at our location.
2- David-3-4, copy that.
434 call.
we got one down.
we need rescue at 10923 Cartland Avenue.
gunshot victim.
put the gun down!
put the gun down! Now!
stay with her.
drop the gun.
John... please...
do what he says. Put down the gun.
they made me go there.
she made me.
she said I could have her, but she didn't tell me what we had to do.
and then the screaming started.
the shooting...
it was so loud and there was blood.
there was so much blood.
John, we can talk about this. You've got to put the gun down.
she said Fiona had to die.
she gave me her gun...
this gun.
Oh, shut up!
I just couldn't do it.
give me that. - No, no!
she was so beautiful.
I didn't want to remember her like that, so I came back afterward.
that awful woman.
sh-she took my Fiona away from me.
now... I have nothing.
we found the murder weapons at Leslie Gitig's house.
knife, gun... the real one.
I killed Chambliss and his family, like I said.
well, it's a good story, but this gun tells a better one.
Maurice, your son did it.
the gun goes back to him, so unless you make us understand what really happened,
Lonny's going to get the needle.
this is crazy, you know, I...
I'd blame Leslie.
it wasn't like she hit your truck by accident.
that's just the beginning of the damage she did to you and your family.
there are no accidents, right?
a woman scorned parks outside her ex-lover's house night after night, thinking about how to destroy him?
what does she see?
a pedophile lusting after a little girl...
stop pushing drugs on my son or I swear I will kill you.
and a father fighting for his son.
three strangers who all want something.
they just need to meet.
I did everything I could to get Lonny clean, and it was working.
then he met Cal, and I was losing him again.
she swore it was just going to be Cal.
Cal's expecting me.
she lied.
what are you waiting for?
once I stepped into that house, I had no choice.
run!
No!
you bitch!
give me that.
no, no!
you know what it's like to lose a kid to drugs, to wish the world for 'em and see that world come crashing down around 'em?
I do, actually.
I do.
but it still doesn't justify killing a whole family.
I'm going to head out.
you need anything?
no, I'm good, thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
cock Robin.
Really?
what journal did you get that one from?
my parents were singers, and that was kind of a favorite around our, our van.
go with what you know, right?
Yeah.
well, it worked, it really worked.
what's going on? Are you all right?
aren't you going to get that?
I don't want to be rude.
Oh, be rude. Good night.
good night.
Hey, doll, how are you?
uh, don't worry about it. I - I'll pick something up for us on the way home.
Yeah, hey, hey, wait, how, how did Charlie do in practice?
three hours earlier
I'm not saying I don't like Vegas.
I'm just saying L. A. clearly owns it in a number of key categories.
Vegas has no heart, no history... - No history?
no taxes ought to quiet your complaint.
no ocean.
all right, Morgan, I'll give you the ocean.
and the weather, and the Lakers.
and the ability to walk down the street without being handed full-frontal business cards.
okay, but if you think L. A. beats Vegas at night, you need professional help.
you offering your services?
Hey, guys, please, we're here for a crime scene.
what is that?
CSI Russell?
rescue helicopter? - Yes, sir.
we just drove 70 miles. We were promised murder.
and you had it, till 30 minutes ago.
what, the vic came back to life?
he didn't have a pulse when I found him on my patrol.
called it in... all of a sudden, he groans.
document everything before we lose him.
GSW in the shoulder.
looks like a bullet graze wound on the forehead.
two gunshot wounds, no blood pool?
this can't be the primary.
get a shot of his wrist.
those are abrasions. That guy was bound.
Yeah. And burned.
looks like two stun gun marks on his neck.
spike 80-50 push.
no wallet? - Nothing.
Yeah! - Hey, it's Nick.
I just landed a double in Northtown.
is there anybody around who can give me a hand?
Catherine and Sara are in court.
it's your lucky day. Our Mount Stirling D. B. just Frankensteined on me.
so I'll send someone your way.
okay, that'd be good. Thanks.
Hey, Greg, why don't you hop on the chopper?
process our vic at the hospital, then head over to Northtown.
Nick has a double he's having trouble with.
Oh, you want me to leave this gorgeous crime scenery?
I'll do it.
all right, you go. We'll stay.
a chopper ride and a double homicide?
I'm up for some excitement.
miss me already?
head 50 yards from your 3: 00.
I think I just found the rest of your scene.
I won't tell Russell I gave you the tip.
you can look smart and owe me one.
all right, thanks.
Hey, sweetheart, it might get a little bumpy.
no sign of forced entry.
mailman spotted them through the iron barred windows.
mailman delivers door-to-door in this neighborhood?
takes some serious mail-sack. - Yeah.
so was the TV or stereo on when the officers responded?
the whole system was blaring.
I know both of these guys. Wes Aykin, Tony Malos.
I busted them for some juvie stuff a while back, but now their ink tells me they've turned pro.
Yeah,"Mad-10"?
Madison and Tenth.
that's the gangsyndicate that runs this hood.
diversified portfolio... drugs, extortion, prostitution, Internet porn.
Mm-hmm, and quite the racket with the fake credit cards.
the killer sure did leave behind a lot of plastic.
you know, it doesn't seem like this was about business.
maybe it was personal.
metal shavings.
coming from the back door.
Yep. Here's our point of entry.
plasma cutter. Slashed right through the metal.
inert gas and an electrical arc create an ultra-hot plasma that chews right through the metal.
Hey, here it is right here.
stolen from Ronston Welding.
I'll give 'em a call.
casa de Brass could use some discounted pipe work.
what can I do? - Just stand back.
I've got epi running. He's gone back into V-fib.
I'm going to shock again.
clear.
actually, lift the lids.
no pupil reaction.
one more time.
clear.
there we go.
welcome back, buddy. You're on your way to the hospital.
Hey, boys.
didn't hear you come in. What's going on?
we already flipped 'em and sticked 'em. Both died around midnight.
I notice some burn marks on the neck consistent with a stun gun.
those are some pretty nasty neck wounds.
they were both garroted.
I found that wire under this victim.
okay. This attack was clearly planned.
the killer used a plasma cutter to gain entry.
he must have known it was a good time to strike.
yo, where's the beer?
what the...?!
why are you doing this to us?!
there are easier ways to end two men.
the killer was either getting off, or trying to get something out of them.
you sure about this, Greg?
sure as I can be.
Oh, there you go.
good hunch, buddy. Way to call it.
eh, just trusting my instincts.
looks like we've got two nine mill casings over here.
so one shot goes into our victim's shoulder, and...
Oh, yes. One shot grazes his head.
definitely our primary.
maybe more than that.
second blood pool.
two more casings.
we got a second gunshot victim?
I don't know. Not much blood.
and it looks like the ground took the brunt of these shots.
no blood or tissue on these bullets.
maybe they didn't hit anybody.
okay, so maybe both of our blood pools come from our guy on the chopper, right?
let's keep looking.
Ah, found his jacket.
and I think I found his ride.
tire impressions.
wide axle. Pickup or SUV?
so they drive our victim up here, they shoot him and then they leave him for dead.
his hands and knees were caked with dirt.
he tried to crawl to the road.
Yeah, here we go.
got a bloody print.
I'll send a photo to Mandy for an I. D.
save your powder. We have a suspect.
yeah? Who is it?
Ronston the welder told me that an assistant of his ran off with a bunch of equipment last night, and didn't show up for work today.
his name is Frank Cafferty and he has a record.
got out six months ago after doing a ten-year stint for manslaughter.
Ah, thatagirl, Mandy. Look, she sent us a match for our print.
so our guy in the chopper is a Frank Cafferty.
that's a little weird.
Stokes.
Yeah, Nick, you just entered a print for a Frank Cafferty into the system.
Yeah, he's my suspect over here. Double homicide.
Yeah, he's our victim.
you mean the exact same guy that's... - Yeah, up in the air with Morgan.
hell, you're a fighter.
this is Medevac 103. Estimated time of arrival at Desert Palm 0945.
tracing Route 160 toward Wilson Ridge.
still in the air, boss.
Really? The Northtown double?
copy that.
I'll make sure he's in custody when we land.
he's convulsing! Protect him!
get the I. V...
I see you touch that radio, or punch in codes, bitch is dead, you hear me? - Yeah.
unstrap me.
I said unstrap me or the cop eats it! - I'm not a cop...
now!
listen up! I want your cans off and your cell phones!
throw 'em back! Now!
hurry up! Come on!
now!
you! Due south. Fly low.
I see a town, a cop, or a highway, it's the last thing you see.
you got it?
Yeah.
where are we going? - Mexico.
I'm not sure how much "we" there's gonna be about it.
so Morgan's still not at your scene?
no, it's been over an hour. She should've gotten there by now.
all right, well, I'll check with Medevac Dispatch.
do you still need a hand? - Nah, I'm good.
Catherine and Sarah finished in court and they're checking out Frank Cafferty's address.
all right, good. Thank you.
no service on Morgan's cell.
dispatch.
uh, yeah, this is D. B. Russell with Crime Lab.
do you have an ETA on a Medevac Three, heading for Mount Stirling to Desert Palm Hospital?
negative. We've been unable to reestablish radio contact with Medevac Three.
all right, well, check with Air Traffic Control, will you, please?
Yes, sir.
maybe they're taking the scenic route.
looks like a match.
stun gun burns on Frank Cafferty's neck and the necks of these dead Mad-10s are three of a kind.
well, Sara and I just got back from Cafferty's apartment.
the door had been kicked in, there were signs of a struggle...
so Cafferty zapped and killed these fine gentlemen in Northtown, retired for the evening...
somebody else...probably from their crew...
went after Frank, busted into his place, used a stun gun on him, then dragged him out and up to the mountains.
any idea what started the feud?
well, Frank'll be at the hospital soon. I'm sure he's got all kinds of answers.
who's Samantha?
you might've been dreaming. You kind of muttered it while you were under.
I wasn't dreaming.
is she someone special?
What'd you do? - Nothing.
you moved! You're trying to do something. - I didn't move.
you're on medication. Your vision's compromised.
Oh, yeah? You want to test my vision, Doc?
Frank, come on, it's not worth it.
please...
put him down. - What?
drug him! I don't want him moving!
I said drug him.
you got five seconds: five... four...
Midazolam... two cc's, front pouch, clear bottle.
Hurry! Do it!
quit eyeballing me.
turn around!
hurry up!
that's right.
now, sit back... enjoy the ride.
okay, thanks, Jim.
so Brass dug in to Cafferty's file. There were no gang connections.
the guy spent the past ten years in prison for a bar fight gone bad.
there was no gang beef while he was in lockup, and prior to prison, he was in the service... chopper pilot.
you know, I've been going through the stuff from his apartment...
you know, he doesn't strike me as a gangbanger.
so what was he doing in that house, torturing and killing two Mad-10s?
did Brass say anything about a daughter?
actually, yes. His Army file claimed that he was divorced with one dependent.
daughter's name is Samantha.
she sent him a letter in prison, four years ago.
I've got a better man in my life now.
he looks out for me like you never have.
you asked me for a recent photo... here you go.
well, she grew up.
Ough!
I've seen him before.
that's one of the Mad-10s that Frank Cafferty killed.
now we know why. So the daughter is the connection.
and that's all we know?
we need to talk.
which one was it this time?
well, that didn't take long. How'd she screw up?
well, she didn't, actually. Let me talk to you a second.
she hitched a ride on a medevac helicopter that was supposed to land an hour ago.
no sign of it yet.
was there a distress call?
no. No radio, no transponder signal, no appearance on radar.
now, look... this is my team, my responsibility.
Yeah...my daughter. - I know. I know.
then again, you're a better supervisor than I ever was a father.
air Traffic Control better have some answers.
when he took off from Mount Stirling, the pilot reported his flight plan to Dispatch.
because of the patient's head wound, he wanted to avoid altitude, so he was going to trace Route 160, and cut across Wilson Ridge toward the city.
now, McCarran radar can't pick up aircraft blocked by the mountains, but at the last radio update to Dispatch, at 9: 27 a. m.the copter was here.
now, it should've emerged from behind the mountains, and onto McCarran radar six or seven minutes later.
it never emerged.
Archie pinged the cells of Morgan, the pilot and paramedic... all three were emanating from a one-acre area here.
sheriff's deputies recovered the phones, but no sign of any wreckage.
Cafferty... he made 'em toss the phones.
that chopper's hijacked.
okay... All right, we keep working the case.
I want to find out everything we can about Frank Cafferty, in case we make contact with him.
I was supposed to be the CSI on that flight.
we don't have time for that right now.
let's just stay focused, and make sure we bring our girl home, okay?
why don't you check out Sara, see what she's got.
so I think I know why Cafferty was at that Northtown house...
he was looking for his daughter.
Samantha used to go out with Wes Aykin, one of the dead Mad-10s.
so, Cafferty figures that Wes and the rest of the gang might know where she was, right?
well, it was more than a hunch. He had seen some awful proof.
I'd found a Web address jotted among Frank's possessions.
a URL... it's a file-sharing site.
specifically, one file.
porn video. She looks drugged.
Yeah.
so Cafferty sees this, and wants to rescue his daughter.
tries to strangle her whereabouts out of Wes and Tony. Right?
so, do we know where she is? - No.
she renewed her license a month ago, but the address she used is a weekly, and she's no longer there.
tire treads Greg photo'd at the mountain scene.
they're high-end run-flats... standard on a number of luxury SUV's...Lexus, BMW, Porsche...
Cafferty had a digital camera.
there were some amateur surveillance photos on it.
he was tracking the Mad-10s. Probably since he got out of prison.
their properties, cars, including... a Porsche Cayenne.
so that could be the vehicle that took Cafferty up into the mountains.
partial plate... I'll run it through DMV.
I had all the techs and interns put out a photo file on the copter...e - mail, Twitter...
saying that: If you see this, let us know.
good idea.
she's a really good CSI.
Nick, you got anything?
Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base, 100 miles south of Mount Stirling, reported a non-transponding radio-silent craft in their airspace 15 minutes ago.
guy in the tower said it looked like Medevac Three.
by the time we got the message, it was off radar.
so they're heading due south. What, Mexico?
chp's on the lookout, but they haven't seen it.
you know, Cafferty may have the pilot zigging and zagging around up there.
Yeah, well, even they're straight-lining it, they're going to have to refuel before they get to the border.
every airstrip between here and there's got a heads up, so...
I got that DNA on the two blood pools you and Greg found at the mountain scene.
the big pool was Cafferty. The small pool was a second contributor...a female.
Cafferty's daughter? - No, a 19-year-old named Tiffany Bamford.
she's got priors for assault; and ties to the Mad-10s.
and I checked hospitals... she's at Desert Palm.
they didn't want me to come in here but... my head just kept hurting worse.
who didn't want you to come here, Tiffany? Who did this to you?
was it the Mad-10s?
they said they weren't really going to do anything to me.
supposed to be fake.
just mess with this guy. Get some cred.
they took me out there.
want your daughter, Frank? Here she is.
no...
look what you've made us do to her!
No!
No!
I'm gonna kill you! You hear me?
No! No!
tell me their names.
I'll protect you, I promise.
can I help you with something?
thought this was my grandmother's room. - Yeah, well, it's not.
my mistake. - Yeah, it is your mistake. Beat it.
now, Tiffany, we can post an officer right outside of your room...
get out.
get out!
so these guys wanted Frank to think they killed Samantha.
the fact that they had to fake it says... what?
she was already dead but they couldn't produce a body?
or she's still alive, they couldn't get their hands on her.
and what if we did? What if we find her, and let Frank know she's still alive.
that might just bring him back down.
Yeah, but how are we gonna find her? No address, no phone number.
and in the meantime, Frank Cafferty thinks he watched his own daughter's murder.
I can't help but think what that might mean for my daughter.
she's dead.
my daughter, Samantha. You asked.
what happened?
when she was little, I was, um... I was a bad person, you know?
I went away.
she ended up getting mixed in with the wrong crowd.
when I got out...
I tried to save her.
you wanted a second chance. - Yeah.
ended up getting her killed.
how?
a month ago, I sat down with my dad for the first time in a dozen years.
he left when you were little, too?
when I was about 14 and he'd messed up so much that my mom decided she wanted to leave for California...
he didn't fight for me to stay.
if he'd only just fought for me.
that would've been enough?
you finally forgave him?
I finally decided it was worth a shot.
so we're starting over.
whatever mistakes he made... we can get past them.
people change.
he's a better man now.
he had a second chance.
look what you made me do!
look what you made me do!
don't you move. You hear me?
don't you move.
okay.
excuse me, Undersheriff? This young woman needs to talk to you.
not the time, Shelley.
I saw on the news about my dad. The, uh, helicopter.
I want to help.
in the air with hostages. for over two hours. t.
do you have any idea which way he's going?
I don't know. I - I barely know him.
letters, when he was in prison, a handful of weekends before that, but we have never been close.
you don't understand. He was trying to save you.
Samantha, your Dad knew that you were caught up with the Mad-10s.
he was trying to rescue you.
I didn't need his help.
I checked outta that life a year ago. I'm sober.
I'm just trying to live quiet.
so, you know what, all of this is just...
no, you know what? My daughter is on that helicopter.
along with an innocent pilot and a paramedic who both have families.
I know.
that's what they said on the news. That's why I'm here.
not to help him.
I just don't want to see him hurt anyone else.
so how do I talk to him?
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
do you copy?
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
he's either not hearing it, or he's not buying it.
no, no, he's probably cruising at a lower altitude.
you know, he'll hear it when he rises above the crest.
I appreciate the rationalization, I really do.
when it comes to Morgan, I've become something of a master at it.
she's 14, she doesn't understand what her mom and I are arguing about.
16-year-olds are all moody, they... she doesn't mean it.
she'll call. She's busy at school.
she's busy at work. She'll call.
she'll call. She'll call. And then she's here.
chip the size of the Stratosphere on her shoulder, still vowing eternal vengeance against me, but, uh...
Hey, you know what? This could be a second chance for you guys.
maybe.
it just cannot end like this.
Hey, Catherine? That Porsche Cayenne from Cafferty's surveillance photos.
DMV had only three matches to the partial plate, but one of them was in the Mad-10" neighborhood.
it's registered to an Alexander Zadian.
brass says he's a shot caller for the Mad-10s.
priors for assault, extortion, possession with intent, and he's on the street right now.
and the best suspect for the attempted murder of Frank Cafferty.
uniforms are out looking for Zadian. I will let you know if their luck changes.
thank you.
well, it's s your call, Ace. We're ten minutes out from Parham Airstrip.
we touch down and refuel, or this party's not going much longer.
shut him up! Go to hell.
we got to get him to a hospital.
please, Frank. I'll stay with you.
just let us land and get him some help.
I can't. - Please!
I can't do that! Shut him up!
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
do you copy?
Frank Cafferty, Samantha is alive and wants to talk to you.
do you copy?
this is Frank Cafferty.
Frank? This is D. B. Russell, L.V. P.D.
there's someone here who would like to talk to you.
go ahead.
dad?
Oh, my God baby!
Sammy, I thought you were dead.
the police told me. That wasn't me, Dad.
I'm... I'm fine.
they also told me you were trying to rescue me.
I tried, Samantha. I tried as hard as I could.
you remember when I was little, that, uh, wishing well you told me was mine?
course I do, baby.
go there. I've sent someone to help you get away. I love you, Dad.
get her out of here! I don't want her talking to anyone!
go north.
Hey, come on, man. We're not gonna make it to the next airstrip.
I got no problem flying solo.
don't you want to see her?
now!
maybe next life, you keep a better grip on your pistol.
while Greg and I work on figuring out what the "wishing well" might be,
I want the two of you to work on who Samantha might have sent out to meet Frank, okay?
now, she didn't have a cell phone on her, so...
she might've stashed that in her car at P. D.
we check her recents, see if we can find the getaway driver she contacted, maybe we can intercept or follow.
good. Yeah, let's do it.
why not let Frank get away?
wouldn't it be safer for Morgan and the others if we just let him land?
let him run.
I don't think so.
why the hell not?
because I'm not so sure that Samantha's trying to help him get away.
that girl hates her father for leaving her.
now, what's more likely, that she wants to help him or hurt him?
that's why.
you gonna be okay? - Yeah.
good.
Samantha Cafferty arrived at P. D. at around 11: 16 a. m.
let's see what she was driving.
black Cayenne.
zoom in.
that's Zadian.
she's in with the Mad-10s.
she set her dad up.
you set them up! You're gonna get them killed! Bitch!
Frank really thinks I tried to help him?
where did you send them?
if they hurt her, I swear to you...
Mad-10s are my family.
Frank killed two of us. He has to pay for that.
where did you send them?
it's done.
web search didn't find any "wishing well" in Nevada.
Cafferty's not picking up on the radio, so we have no idea if he got any of our warnings.
we're gonna have to find this place, so we can get there before Zadian does.
well, Frank and Samantha didn't spend much time together.
so if this wishing well is a shared memory, it might be in one of these boxes.
it's worth a try.
I've got it.
all right, it's a park someplace, right?
Yeah, I'm not sure where.
wait a second. Look-Look at the clothing. I've seen that before.
there's other shots they were wearing that same outfit. I've seen it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here we go.
what is that? Winston's Wild West Village.
that was an old theme park that shut down years ago.
Hey, we're on fumes, man! What are you looking for?
shut up!
there it is. Right there. Take her down now.
wait.
who is that?
cops?!
not cops. Get us out of here.
what? - Now!
that's all she's got!
this is Brass. I want the CSIs to keep their distance.
I got lead. You got that, Sanders?
copy.
follow me.
they're coming. We got to hide.
dude, you've got the gun.
come on.
come on, let's go.
this way, come on. - All right, all right.
I got you. Let's go.
come on.
I got you.
these guys friends of yours?
probably the same guys who left me for dead last night.
bet you wish they'd finished me off, huh?
bet you wish you were in Cabo right now.
how do they know we're here?
they're in here. Cover the back.
come on, we got to go. - I can't.
we got to go! - I can't!
I said,"I can't.
I'm sorry.
I have nothing left.
save yourself, okay?
everything clear outside?
Yeah.
he's over here.
are you hurt? - You still owe me one.
what can I... - I'm fine, Dad.
I just want to get out of here.
Yeah, okay.
can we go? - Sure.
you're going to be okay.
I'm fine.
you're going to be okay.
you're going to be okay.
what are you looking at? - The view.
never seen the city from this perspective before.
it's beautiful. Takes your breath away.
Yeah. It can take more than that.
we used to call this place the Missile Base.
the Missile Base. Care to share why?
why did I bring that up?
all right, I'll tell you what. I'll make it easy for you - I'll go first.
I met my wife freshman year in college, and she was my first and only love.
Seriously?
you lost your virginity to your wife?
Yep. Yep.
life is simple sometimes.
you meet the right person, and you know it's forever.
and that was a boring story, so it's your turn.
Tony Anthopoulos. I was 16.
too many beers, too little romance.
seemed like a good idea at the time.
Ah, that's better. Swept away by the passion of the moment.
something like that.
Tony was a bad boy. First of many.
I liked being wanted... till that got old.
well, you're a very smart woman. You probably just wanted to be appreciated for that, too.
Yeah.
Hey, David.
so, what are we looking at here?
I'm not sure yet. Just got here myself.
the tarp's pretty clean.
doesn't look like it's been dragged or rolled.
looks more like it was carried and placed here.
we'll get it to Trace.
concrete caliche.
not going to get any foot impressions.
there's like a dozen needles here.
but there's no blood.
you get your shots? - Yeah.
there's some expertise demonstrated here.
those needles are thrust through and through - see that?
right under the cornified layers of the epidermis.
minimize the hemorrhaging, maximize the pain.
well, this was not about killing her.
this was about watching her suffer.
I heard Russell cleared you to come back.
if you need more time... - Oh, I'm good.
I might put off that helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon for a while.
Yeah, that'd probably be smart.
well, since you're here, I could use a hand.
Yeah, no problem.
these are 20-gauge hypos.
the kind used in bone marrow transplants.
killer had access to medical supplies.
needles are inserted approximately three inches apart.
perpendicular, in a line, wrist to wrist.
you think the pattern is significant?
seems ritualistic.
but it's definitely sadistic.
hold on.
this isn't a hypo.
shish kabob skewer.
it's a black residue.
looks like candle wax.
the scarring - it's all over her body.
consistent with the needles and the skewer.
you'd think after all these years, I wouldn't be surprised by what people are capable of.
Hodges? What are you doing?
scusi.
did Lorenzo interrupt Michelangelo when he was creating?
he didn't wrap bodies in his canvas.
and I thought you said you didn't find any trace on this.
not trace. Something better.
art.
are you familiar with a pentimento?
what do you think?
it's an alteration in a painting.
when an artist makes a mistake or they want to change something, they simply whitewash over the error, and then begin again.
I don't want to get too excited, but we may have a lost treasure here.
maybe even a Rembrandt.
Really?
I am getting excited. - See?
what I see is more layers. More paint, Leonardo.
maybe what's under here will give us a clue to our killer.
so stop your scratching.
canvas is mine now.
Hey, you better hope I don't find out what that means.
I ran our Jane Doe information through Missing Persons. Nothing.
run it again. - I did.
I know. It doesn't make sense.
the injuries, the evidence all suggest that she was abducted weeks ago.
somebody should have missed her by now.
doctor.
so, C.O. D? - Don't know yet.
I sent samples off to Toxicology. We'll see what Henry has to say.
as you both observed, the external scarring indicates a prolonged period of abuse.
however, I did find something unusual about the injuries.
scar tissue in the wound tracts.
it's as if the needles and the skewer were inserted in the same areas repeatedly.
you mean like body piercing? - Similar.
in piercing, a needle's inserted through the skin, penetrating the various layers of the epidermis.
as scar tissue develops, a permanent hole is created.
difference in this case is, we're not talking about piercings.
no. No, we're not.
we're talking about 20-gauge needles and a barbecue skewer driven repeatedly into this girl's flesh.
that's what we're talking about.
what is this? Is this a knee implant?
hers, I assume.
she had unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
likely due to injury, given the attenuation of her collateral ligaments.
whatever the case, we have a lot number, which will give us an orthopedic surgeon.
and a name for our... our Jane Doe.
Renny was born with an angular limb deformity in both rear legs, which means that her back legs were growing faster than her front legs.
a horse foal my daughter Sylvia is nursing has the same condition, so, in order to help the bones grow, we performed a brief surgical procedure called a peristeal stripping. Now...
Dr. Grier? - Yes?
Catherine Willows with the Crime Lab. I need to speak with you.
I'm sorry. I'm in the middle of a seminar.
it's about your sister Rachel.
so, when was the last time that you saw your sister?
I haven't seen Rachel in years.
she called me a few months ago. Um, she had some medical bills, needed money.
fort Lauderdale. She had knee surgery.
I just wired her the money. I stopped asking questions a long time ago.
my little sister was a wild child.
she ran away after high school.
she broke my mother's heart.
Rachel couldn't even be bothered to come to her funeral.
you say that she met with violence.
what does that mean? What happened?
I'm sorry; I can't discuss the specifics.
what I can tell you is that we found her here in Vegas, and we suspect that she was taken against her will, probably several weeks ago.
that's impossible.
I had lunch with Aunt Rachel on Monday, and she was totally fine.
you had lunch with Rachel? I didn't even know she was in town...
excuse me, Sylvia, you saw your aunt three days ago?
Yeah. I mean, she called, and she said that she was in town and needed to talk.
made me promise not to say anything.
Why?
my mom and Aunt Rachel don't really talk.
but Aunt Rachel wanted things to change; she wanted to fix things.
she wanted to come home.
where did you and your Aunt Rachel have lunch?
the Tangiers.
I don't know. Maybe she was staying there.
Hey, Catherine.
Tangiers was a bust - Rachel Grier was never registered, and no one I. D.'d her photo.
Yeah, I'm on it.
Henry, got my tox report? - Yeah, right here.
great. - Mm, not so great.
what's the problem?
you'll find the findings are both inconclusive and, well, confusing.
she had lidocaine in her system?
but it didn't kill her.
injected at therapeutic levels directly into the tissue surrounding the hypodermic needles
and the skewer.
what kind of sadist uses an anesthetic before torturing their victims?
I dug out these images, using optical microscopy.
so what are we feeling about this? Depressed.
Yeah, I mean, it's no Rembrandt.
you know, maybe it's a Rachel Grier. I mean, look at that.
that's gotta be more than a coincidence.
Yeah, there's a similar pattern to the needles in her arms.
and the flames - we did find candle wax residue.
now, is it me or does she look like a human candelabra?
all right, let's think about this.
maybe our victim was posed to look like this painting.
so you're saying you think that our killer was inspired by this image?
maybe.
or maybe the killer got artistic as he was torturing her.
poses her, paints her, doesn't like his work, so he whitewashes over it, and then just wraps her up in his failure.
question is, which came first - the Rachel Grier or Rachel Grier?
Hey, guys.
I just did an image search for "human candelabra" Check it out.
major Willie's Rambling Carnival and Curious Extravaganza.
what century you get this out of?
this one, as in tonight, two shows, 7:00 and 10: 00.
featuring the Human Candelabra.
the Magnificent Femmistopheles, Empress of Pain.
looks like it's time for a road trip.
that's the oldest trick in the book.
about all they're good for nowadays.
you buy the darts for ten of your Yankee dollars.
now, who will be next?
pop the cherry, win a prize.
come on, you have to do better than that.
pop the cherry, win a prize.
this is entertainment?
hard to tell who's more entertained.
well done, mate.
sorry, kitty's not a virgin.
zodiac will be back in 15 minutes.
be seeing you.
Oh... my... God.
Oh, it looks like Femmistopheles is a no-show.
I want to look inside.
can I help you?
we're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
sorry, no comping the constables here, I'm afraid.
so who's in charge of this freak show?
me - you've seen the game, you know the name.
major Willie at your service.
good to know.
have you seen this woman?
seen her? I've seen all of her.
Femmistopheles, Empress of Pain.
so, what'd she do this time?
she's dead.
that's... unfortunate.
you don't seem too broken up.
or surprised.
maybe we know why.
am I surprised Rachel's dead? No.
and why is that?
well, take a look around you. You've heard what your friend said - we're freaks.
you try cranking up this whoopee machine two shows a night, on the road 351 days a year, ending up in places you wouldn't want to be seen dead in.
sorry, poor choice.
so what was it - O. D.old ex?
Rachel always did have the most appalling taste in men.
does that include you?
I was the best thing that ever happened to her.
I saw qualities in Rachel she couldn't see in herself.
lucky girl.
Willie, we need to check out that tent, so you gonna step aside or do we need to go get a warrant?
boss. Joey needs his intro.
it's all good.
I'm gonna keep my eye on Willie.
Yeah, D.B.I'm gonna grab some equipment. I'll be right back.
life is full of terrible surprises and miserable fates.
consider that of a young woman, heavy with child, mauled by a ferocious pachyderm - her son born hideously deformed, yet able to sow the seeds of future generations, all cursed to the same twisted destiny.
ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the last heir of the House of Merrick - Joseph the Elephant Man!
surprised? Disgusted?
not what you paid to see?
I want to draw your attention to the condition of this poor specimen.
note the aquiline jaw, the sharp, muscular definition.
this animal... is not one of us.
he is not a freak, a freak like me.
I got hypos and skewers.
I got blood.
if she was tortured in this chair, the blood pattern's off.
there's no void.
hey - see these streaks? This contraption could be our blood source.
where is, uh... Oh, yeah.
what, what do I call you again?
can you tell us a little bit more about Femmistopheles' act?
wasn't an act. It was unlike anything you ever seen.
she didn't just give a performance. She gave her own blood.
she rocked the house.
and people - what, they'd pay extra to see this?
what's the point in torturing yourself if we ain't all going to have some fun?
okay, and what's back there?
Femmie's dressing room. She lived in it.
empress of pain and pleasure.
you mind?
thought you were a coffee snob.
machine in my office is broken. I'm waiting for parts.
a little light reading, I see.
satisfying my curiosity.
so Nick and I found a whole pharmacy in Rachel Grier's tent, including lidocaine.
Henry is sourcing the stuff for me. Also running an expanded tox panel.
maybe one of the other drugs killed her.
here, we thought some sick bastard tortured the girl.
maybe she OD'd.
Nah, you know, I don't think so, actually.
I mean, she certainly wouldn't have wrapped up her own body and dumped it.
no.
you know, there's something about this Major Willie. He reminds me of...
I told you about my parents being singers, right? - Yeah.
performers, really.
when I was a kid, they were part of this traveling show.
we went around the country in our van.
anyway, the leader of this group was a, a guy who called himself Durga Joe.
he was a real charismatic, kind of like this Willie guy.
he could make people...
he could make people do pretty much anything he wanted.
that was the problem, at least for my parents, so, one day they decided they wanted to leave and Durga Joe did not like that at all.
what happened?
in the middle of the night, we got in our van and we just took off.
and never really... looked back.
anyway... the point is that this Rachel Grier, she wanted to leave, too, you know?
she wanted to go home.
maybe this is about control.
major Willie's Rambling Carnival - one big, happy family.
until somebody wants to leave.
got your new and improved tox panel.
I know what killed Rachel Grier and maybe who.
major Willie - aka Steven Watt of Tampa, Florida.
you know, without the Willy Wonka get-up, you could pass for just another freak.
the word is "geek," as in someone who can perform freakish acts without actually themselves being a freak of nature.
I'll take your word for it.
and I will take that.
Oh, look. What's he going to do?
Yeah, and if you think that's freaky...
don't worry, I'll regurgitate it later.
we gotta learn how to do that.
so, uh... we know what killed Rachel - propofol.
which is used in anesthesia, but in high enough doses and without a ventilator, it paralyzes the diaphragm.
so basically... Rachel... suffocated to death.
you're licensed in Florida and New York to practice body piercings and modifications.
that's how you were able to obtain the pharmaceuticals we found in Rachel's tent.
you people just don't get it.
we don't get what?
freaks versus geeks.
a guy like Zodiac, he has congenital analgesia.
he was born not feeling pain - a freak.
Rachel and me, we need... needed help.
a little pharmacology.
stuff like lidocaine, to take the edge off the pain, to enhance performance.
no drugs, no show, no dough.
I won't lie - maybe at the end of the evening we all like to indulge in a little...something something... to ease an old carney's burden.
but straight up... I am a businessman; I look after my people, I take care of them.
and Rachel, she was an earner.
who wanted to stop earning, I believe.
she would never have left me.
you didn't find any propofol in Rachel's tent, did you?
no.
am I under arrest?
not yet, no. But this, uh, this is just our opening act.
here. One for the road.
got the DNA results from Rachel Grier's tent - the blood Russell found in the fridge is a match to Rachel.
also the torture chair.
well, it makes sense. Rachel was storing her blood to use in her act.
Yeah, well, the blood also tells us another story - hormone levels suggest that Rachel was pregnant.
labels on the pack say as recently as two weeks ago.
there was no evidence in autopsy.
not just that.
Nick found traces of blood and semen in Rachel's bed.
single donor.
no hits in CODIS.
profile is a male Caucasian suffering from neurofibromatosis type-1 and Proteus Syndrome.
Rachel was sleeping with the Elephant Man?
so, last heir to the House of Merrick. That's a good story.
I saw the movie, too - it was... I liked it.
but truth is, there is... no house, right?
because the Elephant Man didn't have any children.
so your name's not really Merrick, is it?
no. My name is Joshua Helm.
and, Joshua, you don't have any children, either, do you?
no.
Rachel Grier made sure of that.
she got rid of the baby.
just like she wanted to get rid of you.
you don't know what you're saying. Rachel and I were in love.
is that why she was making plans to leave the show?
Yes.
I told her she was crazy, that we couldn't have a normal life on the outside.
Wait-wait-wait a minute. So you're saying that the two of you were planning on going away together?
that's what she wanted.
you could survive on the outside, but I can't.
you can with me.
I love you, Joshua - that's all that matters.
Rachel had lost the child, and she wanted to try again.
I said no.
I told her she could leave if she wanted to, but that I wasn't going with her.
Rachel was always naive, living in a fantasy land.
you do tell a good story.
is that what you think this is?
I've already seen the show, and I'm familiar with the story.
girl hates her life, is searching for something, thinks she finds it in a man, a man who needs her, and then...
it all goes wrong.
you killed her because she wanted her life back.
look... I don't know what happened to Rachel, and if you're trying to provoke me, it's not working.
you can't imagine how the love that we had for each other existed, because you've never known it.
and you never will.
so, we turned Major Willie's Carnival upside down, didn't find any propofol.
we have any record of him buying the stuff?
no, we have nothing to tie him to the drugs that killed Rachel, and Brass just cut him loose.
Yeah.
you kidding me?
Greg'll be interested to hear that. Thanks, Jimbo.
well, it looks like we're gonna have to cut Major Willie loose again.
well... rigor hasn't set in.
T. O.D.'s less than two hours ago.
no vital response.
he was dead before he was hanged.
staged. - Yeah, poorly.
okay, cut him down, get him to Autopsy.
let's find out what really killed him.
CSI Stokes? - Yeah.
we've got a suspect in custody.
which one of the freaks is it?
there.
Rachel Grier's niece?
this is insane.
Dr. Grier, your daughter was detained while fleeing the scene of an apparent homicide.
I... I don't know what Sylvia was doing at the freak show, but...
but I do know that she would never hurt anyone.
well, then neither you nor Sylvia has anything to be afraid of.
what were you doing there, Sylvia?
I went there because I needed to see for myself.
see what?
s - See who my aunt really was.
I found the story online,"Sideshow Performer Murdered" and it was Aunt Rachel.
to my mom, Aunt Rachel was a ghost, but... to me, she was like this... force of nature.
you know? She did what she wanted to do and lived how she wanted to live, and I just felt this... connection.
I mean, is that weird?
look, I didn't kill that man.
why don't you tell me what happened?
I went looking for where Aunt Rachel had been living, and I got lost.
and I wandered into that tent, and that's when I saw him.
I was so scared.
and then, they were all staring at me.
I mean, they thought I did it.
so I ran.
and I hid, but the officers found me.
do you believe her?
Sylvia? Yes.
well, I don't know what to believe anymore. I think I made a mistake about Major Willie.
I think I let my past cloud my thinking.
well, we're all guilty of that.
whoa, what do you mean?
you're not having doubts about our Elephant Man, are you?
no. No. I mean, I don't like being called out about my lack of romance, but it's no argument for innocence.
you still think Elephant Man had motive to kill Rachel?
Yes. Yes, and I think Sylvia was sincere about feeling a connection towards her aunt, which says to me that she wouldn't do her any harm.
okay.
but that doesn't mean that she wouldn't go after the man who she believed did.
major Willie?
but why would she suspect that he killed Rachel?
we're not even convinced ourselves.
maybe somebody whispered Willie's name in her ear.
maybe our real killer.
okay. What have we got here, boys?
well, your carnival barker's C. O.D. was massive internal hemorrhaging due to an inch-and-a-half laceration and perforation of the stomach wall, severing the left gastro-omental artery.
check it out.
stomach wall's punctured from the inside out.
that's bigger than a paper clip.
I found no injuries to the pharynx or esophagus.
so, it's not like somebody shoved something down his throat.
no, no. Guy swallowed a sword.
check that out.
well, that would do it.
actually, our friend here swallowed lots of things.
good thing for us, Major Willie bit off more than he could chew.
Gemini.
sign of the Zodiac.
take your shirt off.
you want to play, you got to pay.
Oh, I got my ticket right here, Muscles. It's called a search warrant.
now, take it off.
if you want a picture with me, your friend right there I'm sure will take it.
no, that's all right. I'll pass.
we're done here.
check him for warrants while you're at it.
Catherine, it's Nick.
no go on Zodiac.
we're gonna need a pile of warrants.
we're gonna need to bring the whole freak show down here.
I need to see your chest, too.
you want some help?
remove the bandage.
dog bite.
I hope you had all your shots.
sergio the Strong.
where do you people come up with the stage names? I mean, I get it, I do.
because "Seth the Strong" doesn't look good on a poster.
but "Seth Soon-To-Be-Convicted"- that has a ring to it.
we got back the DNA profile on your ounce of flesh.
looks like you and the Elephant Man were fraternal twins.
I got to admit, I didn't see that coming.
let me guess, mom always liked you best.
we know Rachel broke your brother's heart.
you made her pay for that.
and then when Willie found out what you did, you shut him up, too.
is that about right?
our mom died during childbirth.
dad dumped us before we could walk.
and when Joshua started to...change, the relatives we were staying with got freaked out.
said that Joshua and me were born of the Devil.
for my brother, there was only one path to salvation.
major Willie's Rambling Carnival and Curious Extravaganza.
Willie was no saint, but he was better than most.
he didn't treat my brother like a monster. He was... he was good to him.
until... - Until what?
what the hell happened?
I don't know. I just found her like this.
maybe she OD'd or something.
you call the cops?
you crazy? They'll close us down.
you got to help me, Seth. We need to make this go away.
think about your brother.
no show. Where does that leave him?
so I did what he asked me.
I made it all go away.
but it didn't go away.
and we all know that Rachel didn't just OD.
you people found out what was going on between Joshua and Rachel.
you hauled him in here, you questioned him.
but he didn't do it.
how do you know that?
cause I know who did.
cops picked up Joshua.
don't sweat it. That's just what they do.
Josh will be fine.
best thing you can do is to keep your mouth shut.
trust me.
not this time.
I didn't mean to kill him.
I thought that if I made it look like he killed himself, that it all would really go away.
you don't believe me, do you?
we believe the evidence.
there's your evidence.
Willie killed Rachel.
heard the suspect coughed up the smoking gun.
Yeah.
what, did Nick leave you to do the dirty work?
no. Actually, I wanted to run this myself.
so, Sergio found the propofol when he was cleaning up Rachel's tent?
Yeah, he had doubts about Willie, so he decided to hang onto this.
in his stomach?
better than a safety deposit box, I guess.
little messier.
so the propofol belonged to Willie?
that's what Sergio thinks. I'm not so sure.
why not?
Willie was the resident Dr. Feel Good.
well, if we're to believe Sergio's story, Willie talked him into dumping a body for him.
I mean, come on. Guys like Willie are the consummate con artists.
they're, like, the best salesmen in the world.
so my question is: if he was worried about losing Rachel, why wouldn't he just talk her out of it?
if he could talk her out of it, there'd be no reason to kill her.
right.
so back to the Elephant Man?
Nope.
we traced the drug that killed your sister Rachel to the Clark County Zoo.
to you.
Why?
my daughter always worshipped Rachel.
even though she was barely a part of our lives.
to Sylvia, Rachel was this adventurer, this nonconformist, a free spirit
everything I wasn't, everything wasn't allowing Sylvia to be.
Rachel was just a fantasy.
until she wasn't.
she wanted to come back into our lives.
to insert her twisted self into our home.
sh-she was having sex with that... that thing.
what kind of a sick person would do that?
she was your sister. - No... she wasn't.
she was... she was a freak.
I told her there was no place in our home for her.
but she wouldn't listen.
she tried to go through Sylvia to get to me.
she used her.
my own daughter.
who always loved my sister more than she loved me.
my sister left me no choice.
and you left her to suffocate.
I did what I had to do.
I protected my daughter.
you don't understand.
she's the only family I have.
I would've done anything... anything to protect her.
Sylvia's safe now.
she's safe from the monsters in this world.
Yes, she is.
it's a simple proposal - you, me, a bottle of Cristal.
I gotta take this.
welcome to Tasty Time.
like to try our new chocolate sundae?
Hello?
come in Houston.
tasty Time. Over.
number 17.
okay.
uno diecisiete coming up.
want that monster-sized?
I'll take that as a no.
$6. 43. Pull forward.
that was very funny.
Hey, who's gonna pay for this?
so according to the Tasty Time kid over here, this whole thing started when the convertible just cruised through the fast food window.
got nailed by the truck.
you know what they say, fast food kills you.
not usually quite so faSt.
so the witnesses at the burger joint said that the car seemed to be on autopilot - no driver.
so maybe he had a heart attack or an aneurysm and slumped over after ordering.
last supper, favorite restaurant.
he didn't have a chance to enjoy it.
the R. O. is Danny Clegg.
he's got a long sheet - burglary, assault possession, you know.
what did he order?
Why?
curious.
he ordered a number 17 - triple cheeseburger deluxe.
okay. All right.
so Jeep gets clipped by this convertible - Mr. 17.
red paint transfer from the convertible.
knocking him off-course and into the light pole.
the driver was ejected. No seat belt.
James Marshall, 20's, college kid.
second DUl this year.
he was working on this third here.
Yeah, he got more than a hangover this time.
well, this boy cracked his egg wide open.
what about our truck driver?
okay, so the truck hits the convertible, rolls on its side.
leaving the driver speechless.
all right, fellas, we got a math problem here.
never very good at math.
we got three dead drivers, right? - Right.
all with their brains still inside their heads. - Yeah. So?
what's this brain doing down here?
this is going to be fun.
you must be Charlie.
sorry. I was just...
no, no, no, no, it's all good.
I'm Nick Stokes. It's nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.
you're the same guy that's the starting point guard at WLVU, right? - Yeah.
nice work.
are you, uh, are you here for a family meeting?
dad's talked about our family meetings?
well, they've been pretty much dialed into the curriculum around here.
so is he serious about raising your hand?
not anymore. No, we had a family meeting about that.
Hey, look who's here. Hey, buddy.
you met my son. Pretty cool, huh?
what are you doing here? I thought the bus to Tempe was leaving at 2: 00.
Yeah, it did.
Oh, you have a game tonight?
which clearly you're not going to make.
I tell you what - Mr. Russell, if you would call me after you've read that.
it's the DMV records on all our vics.
Clegg's the only one with a rap sheet.
it's good to meet you, Charlie.
Hey, I really look forward to seeing you light it up, man.
Thanks. - All right.
all right. Talk to me.
I missed curfew last night by, like, five minutes.
coach suspended me for a game. It's stupid.
what's stupid? You broke a rule.
technically, but Coach is a lot different now that I'm recruited.
he's a little Mussolini.
Yeah, but the rules didn't change, did they?
all right.
stop by the house tonight and we'll talk it through, okay?
Hey, just for the record, exactly how long is "like five minutes"?
three hours, give or take.
got a cooler here.
maybe Clegg was drinking and driving.
maybe.
no booze.
I don't know about drinking and driving.
more like thinking and driving.
got some brain matter here.
looks like Clegg might have been transporting our mystery brain.
you know, he could be working for a medical company or something like that.
well, he was definitely into medicine, but I wouldn't trust him to drive my brain around.
yeah? Why's that?
oxy.
I got a duffle bag.
guy liked to work out.
he was into other lifting, too.
got a burglary tool.
starting to get a picture of this Clegg guy.
Yeah, me, too.
there's some yellow powder on the crowbar.
got some yellow powder in the bag, too.
I have seen crappy cocaine that color.
I've never seen a drug addict waste this much product.
you know, we are down one body.
trunk's where I'd hide it.
Yeah, pop it for me, will you?
Pigskin?
that's it?
you know, this is strange. - Why?
I'm starting to think Russell's a psychic.
how come?
Well,'cause he asked what Clegg ordered at the drive-thru window.
it was a number 17.
or it's a coincidence, maybe.
he hadn't opened the trunk yet.
the police have arrived. Thank God.
you... you have fun at work, don't you?
some people are visual, others are audio.
I just happen to be both- audio-visual.
I like to process the entire experience.
so the tire truck smacks into the convertible, the convertible clips the Jeep, and hello, light poSt.
I have a theory about that.
okay, so the brain is riding shotgun in the cooler.
car gets smashed by the truck.
cooler gets slammed up against the door- doonk- and out pops our magical mystery brain.
it's only defense was to roll under a tire.
Hey, Russ, I found this football in Clegg's trunk.
it's got a number 17 on it.
I'll be damned. Look at that.
how'd you know that?
what color is the horse?
Really? No, it's a famous story.
a traffic accident near a ranch, right?
several cars and a horse are involved.
the horse is severely injured and the officer at the scene wants to put him out of his misery with his. 357.
unfortunately, the bullet ricochets off the horse's skull and hits an officer standing nearby.
kills him dead as a doornail.
and when this is all reported to the chief, the only question he asks,"What color's the horse?"
there were seasoned investigators all over that scene for hours, taking notes, gathering evidence
but nobody noted the color of the horse.
if you miss one small detail, then who knows what else you've missed.
cause you never know what's important.
cool story, huh?
that is a good story.
looks like Mr. Clegg swallowed a couple oxycodones antemortem.
Sara did find drugs in is car.
he's got a lot of track marks. Clegg here was a junkie.
looks like chicken nuggets.
takes two to four hours for food to clear the stomach.
this guy binged on fast food before he ordered more.
equal opportunity junkie.
junkie being the operative word.
I don't think Mr. Clegg died as a result of the accident.
frothy edematous lungs, pills, track marks - looks like an O. D.
so, where are we going to do about the brain-topsy?
to the scale, Ms. Brody.
weigh it.
cool.
3. 4 pounds.
that's heavy-ish.
a female brain tips the scales at probably 2. 8-ish.
average male brain weighs just over three pounds.
average female just under.
so this brain's a boy.
DNA confirmed it. Didn't help us any making the I. D.
Hello, Brain Doe.
so what's next?
check it for freshness, see if there are any signs of decomp.
blood vessels still look fairly red.
go ahead, poke it.
that's it.
feels like Jell-O.
it's unfixed. No grossing or formalin present.
means it was extracted within the last 24 hours.
incision is precise, brain stem's been cut clean.
skillfully removed.
cutter was a pro.
maybe a research specimen?
no way.
specimens are immediately fixed in formaldehyde.
that's even more awesome.
we might be talking about black market brains.
Thanks, Doc. This has been fun.
is it just me or are defense attorneys getting smarter?
No! Slimier!
don't worry, we still have the truth on our side.
I still don't like that guy.
there was nothing wrong with my evidence collection.
at least he didn't ask you if it was Dr. Willows.
coming or going?
we are just returning from court, Sheriff.
Sanders, you look like you could use a cup of coffee.
nice seeing you, too, Sheriff.
you in the neighborhood?
not really.
so, um... how are things going?
no complaints.
really. I'd complain.
you were a supervisor, now you're not.
no advancement on the horizon.
I'd be pissed.
I work with some good people.
it takes the sting off.
well, maybe I can do a little better than that.
I've been spending a lot of time on the Hill.
senate Judiciary Committee is exploring establishing a Forensic Science Commission.
they need a full time staffer, expert in the field.
I recommended you.
I hope you're good with that.
I don't know what to say.
do you really want to be processing used condoms and dirty panties the rest of your career?
go to D. C.
pay's good, the hours are great.
you get to travel.
sometimes you have to move out to move up.
if you're interested, don't take too long.
thank you, Sheriff.
thank you. I appreciate the confidence.
it's not easy for us. Not in law enforcement.
it's a... man's world.
sheriff.
you here on business?
always.
everything all right?
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
no reason. No reason at all.
um, just got a call-out. A 406 at a mortuary.
and you're gonna love this part... comes with an NRS 200. 033.
I have no idea what the hell that is.
you ever seen so many numbers in a sentence before?
is this an assignment or an observation?
uh, yeah. Sorry. Both.
okay. Got it.
only two brains were transported in the last 24 hours.
one belonged to Nora Babbit, 77, Alzheimer's patient.
her brain went to WLVU Center for Gerontology.
and the other one?
Ryan Dempsey, 42, suicide.
his brain went to St. Sebastian's.
being studied for repetitive trauma.
so both the packages arrived?
safe and unsound.
that's what I call a dead end.
Hi, Lou.
you okay?
why does everybody keep asking me that? - Okay...
lieutenant Theodore Seligson, 30. On leave from Afghanistan.
cutting trees in his backyard. He fell and he broke his neck.
guy survived the war... - Yeah.
family's Jewish. Now, they had to get him in the ground by this morning.
someone is supposed to remain with the body, but the mortuary night guy stayed with his girlfriend last night instead.
came in this morning, and he called it in.
that was Mrs. Seligson, the widow.
she came by as soon as she heard.
how bad is it?
you need to see for yourself.
I didn't think corpses bled.
embalming is considered desecration.
Oh, really?
what about cutting a guy's head open and taking his brain?
this guy was a war hero.
I heard you guys found a brain outside a Tasty Time.
that's gotta be his, right?
well, it better be. Otherwise, we got a brain collector on the loose in Vegas.
heard you could use a little help. - Yeah, thanks.
our mortuary owner said that when they close at 10: 00, the last thing they do is mop the floors.
these impressions have got to belong to our brain thief.
you haven't heard. - Heard what?
Henry ran the DNA of our mystery brain against Lieutenant Seligson's DNA in the military database.
no match?
somebody breaks into a mortuary and steals a brain.
meanwhile, across town, another brain flies out of a convertible during a TC.
I mean, what are the odds?
the two events have to be related.
this powder here says that they are.
Nick and I processed Clegg's car. We found a crowbar and yellow powder that looked like this.
so Clegg is the connection.
maybe.
Hodges. I'm sending you a photo of a shoe impression.
I need you to compare it to our convertible driver Clegg's shoes.
coming at you.
perfect match.
clegg was definitely at the mortuary.
and he'd been there before. Clegg's employment records.
guy held down a half-dozen odd jobs, including grave-shift body pickups for mortuaries across town.
his tox panel - serious drug cocktail. Positive for oxycodone, fentanyl and DMT.
what's DMT? I don't know that.
it's found in certain herbs.
creates a super-intense high that only lasts about two minutes- instant painkiller.
okay, so, Clegg was intensely high at both scenes - the brain snatching and the traffic accident.
but somewhere in between, Seligson's brain is magically replaced with our mystery brain - how?
well, we know the timeline.
clegg stole Seligson's brain sometime after 10: 00 p. m. when he hit the mortuary, and sometime before 3: 00 a. m.when he hit the drive-thru.
with a new brain.
so... oh, Lord.
um, all right, so...
who's our mystery brain belong to, and where did Lt. Seligson's go?
chicken nuggets.
sorry?
doc found partially digested chicken nuggets in Clegg's stomach
that means he got some junk food at least two to three hours before he O. D'd.
okay, so, Clegg nuggeted up around midnight.
maybe he switched brains then.
well, if he did get the urge, then the best place to go would be Tasty Time.
maybe that's where he nuggeted up.
so somebody needs to find out how many Tasty Times there are in Vegas.
Twenty-two. - Really?
I know it seems like a lot.
at times, it feels like it's not enough.
let's pull surveillance from all of them.
let's just take Clegg's car for a spin, shall we?
Wow...this guy always ordered chicken nuggets.
not true. He ordered a number 17 triple cheeseburger deluxe right before he died.
yeah? Well, see what happens when you break pattern?
Oh, wait. Got it.
tasty Time on Altos Boulevard.
11: 53 p. m. last night.
Oh, and guess what he ordered? Nuggets.
Clegg's car.
he's meeting somebody.
think he's going to share his nuggets?
I think he's swapping brains.
explains how Clegg ended up with our mystery brain.
volvo driver gets Seligson's.
punch in on the plate.
volvo's registered to a Dr. Hanson Eller.
Seneca address.
Eller is a private pathologiSt. Man would know how to remove a brain.
maybe he took out our mystery brain.
wait a second - Seneca.
two brains were transported for research. One of them was a suicide from Seneca.
here it is - the brain belonged to Ryan Dempsey.
Vegas local... he also had a cabin in Seneca.
the death certificate was signed by our pathologist, Dr. Hanson Eller.
guy's a licensed doctor.
what's he doing swapping brains at midnight in a Tasty Time parking lot?
I'll call Brass, have him put a broadcast out on Eller.
somebody should break the news to the Dempsey family.
you're wrong.
my husband's instructions were very specific.
and I got a call from St. Sebastian's this morning.
his brain arrived.
Yeah. A brain arrived.
we don't believe that it was your husband's.
well, how could that be?
well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
did your husband donate all of his organs to research?
no, just his brain.
Ryan... thought he had C. T.E.
chronic Traumatic Encephalitis.
my husband was a mixed marital arts fighter.
if you've ever seen an S. F.F. match, you know the beatings those guys take.
Ryan took a lot of hits over the years.
concussions.
but he always fought through it.
said he was doing it for us.
a year ago, he started having problems with his memory.
you know, he'd get confused... upset...
and when he got upset, he...
things could get bad.
Hey, kid.
you're Declan, right? Ryan Dempsey's boy.
I'm Jim Brass.
I heard about your dad.
and you're sorry for my loss?
Yeah, I am.
the thing about CTE is they don't know if you have it until after you're dead.
you know, they-they study your brain.
even killing himself, all he could think about was making sure his brain could be studied.
how crazy is that?
I'm sorry to ask you this, Mrs. Dempsey, but can you walk me through what happened right after the suicide?
it was the worst night of my life.
my son and I had been out hiking.
Ryan wasn't feeling well.
and when we got back to the cabin...
we found him.
I didn't know what to do, so I called um... a family friend.
who was that?
it was Ryan's trainer, Bill Pernin.
he made the arrangements? He called the pathologist, Dr. Eller?
I... I suppose so.
did you talk with Dr. Eller?
the man who was going to remove my husband's brain?
I didn't care to meet him.
no, of course not.
did you get along with your Dad?
you get along with yours?
no. Took a belt to me.
tough.
he was a cop, too.
he was not a happy guy.
I was, like, 15 before I had the balls to belt him back.
I popped him in the jaw.
I could tell it hurt, too.
never felt better, I never felt worse.
how 'bout your Mom? She get along with your Dad?
let's go, Deck.
wife had bruising.
Yeah, the kid's awfully quiet.
I'll do some checking. See if there were any domestic violence calls.
call Seneca P. D. They had a family cabin up there.
vacations can be stressful.
I wouldn't know.
hold on.
where?
okay, lock it down till we get there.
Dr. Eller's car just showed up.
I'll send Nick.
what do we know? - Security heard shots fired less than 30 minutes ago.
no surveillance. - Yeah, and no witnesses.
found the vehicle just like this, backed into the space with the windows down.
hm, looks like a meet.
Yeah, and it wasn't his firSt. We got him on tape at Tasty Time trading brains with Clegg.
it's a single GSW to the left temple through and through.
bullet's in the headliner.
slight upward angle.
Now...unless the shooter's four feet tall...
the car pulled up right alongside of him, right here.
dips out of the driver's-side window and bam!
nine millimeter.
we know Eller and Clegg had some kind of business arrangement.
well, maybe some third party wanted a share of their brain game.
Yeah, a silent partner.
who silenced Eller.
Dr. Eller delivered this brain to the hospital under the name Ryan Dempsey.
but DNA has confirmed that the brain is not Dempsey's.
in fact, it's Lieutenant Seligson's.
couldn't pick him out in a crowd.
I beg to differ.
care to elaborate?
take a look at that butchered brain stem.
this brain's a hack job.
but Dempsey's brain, the one they found at the accident, was surgically removed by a qualified surgeon.
hack job on Lieutenant Seligson's brain suggests that the cuts were made in a hurry, maybe even improvised.
which can only mean one thing...
so you're saying that somebody wanted a brain in a hurry, so they broke into the mortuary and hacked out Lieutenant Seligson's?
Ryan Dempsey commits suicide.
he's convinced he's got a degenerative brain disorder, so he donates his brain to science.
but Clegg swaps it out so it can't be studied.
giving him a brain upgrade in the process.
upgrade?
that's why Clegg chose Seligson's brain.
lieutenant Seligson was Jewish.
and Jewish tradition says a body can't be embalmed.
preferably it goes in the ground within 24 hours.
so, the Lieutenant's brain was fresh.
just what St. Sebastian's was expecting.
a perfect specimen. No chemicals, no decomp.
no brain disease.
okay, so Ryan Dempsey wanted to have his brain studied 'cause he was afraid he had CTE and he wanted the truth to come out.
and clearly someone else didn't.
someone who was willing to grave rob, brain swap and pop a pathologist to cover it all up.
the silent partner.
Hodges, what are you doing?
um, it's a break room. I'm on a break.
you know chickens' nuggets don't really look like that, right?
please don't ruin my lunch. - Fine.
uh, yellow powder trace? Give.
receive.
you know, I've been trying to text you for over an hour.
talcum powder.
in Clegg's duffel bag, on the crowbar, at the mortuary.
in my report, powder's made with a special formulation with five essential oils, used in high-end gyms, including my own.
you go to the gym?
under this shirt... ripped.
Oh, I-I believe you.
page four - it's a list of gyms.
not even real chicken in there.
Ryan Dempsey. "The Man Without Fear."
pretty good record: 52 and nine.
Ooh, that looks like one of the nine.
Yeah, and that... looks like Danny Clegg.
the guy that had Dempsey's brain in his convertible?
they knew each other. They were in the S. F.F. together.
they trained together until Clegg got kicked out of the league for drugs.
well, that powder in Clegg's gym bag was a specific type of talc used at certain gyms.
"bill Pernin's Power Center. " It's on the liSt.
Dempsey's widow said Bill Pernin was his trainer.
and he's the family friend who made arrangements for Dempsey's brain.
Yeah, that connects him to Dempsey, Clegg and Dr. Eller.
Pernin just signed a multi-million-dollar deal with Real Fuel?
one of his fighters turning up with CTE cannot be good for advertising.
bill Pernin? - Yeah. Can I help you?
you got a minute?
Yeah.
let me guess, you two are here about the Real Fuel Couple's Boot Camp, huh?
Ah, it's gonna be a terrific weekend.
Sara Sidle. Greg Sanders. We're with the Crime Lab.
can we talk somewhere out of the way?
nice facility.
Oh, thanks, man. It's my dream.
you know, 20 years of blood, sweat and tears.
so, uh, what's up?
you guys aren't here to hit the heavy bag. What's going on?
we're here about Dr. Hanson Eller.
the, uh, pathologiSt. Yeah, he used to train at my old gym.
you hired him to remove your friend Ryan Dempsey's brain?
Yeah, yeah, that's right. His wife asked me to help with the funeral arrangements.
I don't think those were the arrangements that she had in mind.
what are you talking about?
we're talking about how your friend Ryan Dempsey's brain ended up in your other friend Danny Clegg's cooler.
okay... look, I'm still t following you.
Eller, Dempsey, Clegg, the only thing these three guys had in common, other than your training, is that they're all dead.
look, if something happened to Danny Clegg and Dr. Eller, that's news to me.
when's the last time you saw them?
I haven't seen Danny in months.
poor guy was a junkie. I had to toss him out of here.
and Dr. Eller, the last time we saw each other, I was crying over my friend's body.
if you'll excuse me, I got about three different meetings that I'm late for.
so if you need me, my number's on the wall.
other than that, great meeting you.
would you buy a membership off that guy?
not a lifetime one.
well, I don't think I am overreacting.
Yeah, he lied to his coach, then he lied to me.
it's not just about basketball. It's about life.
Yeah, you say that whenever you're trying to get off the phone, so I'm gonna get off the phone firSt.
I love you, too.
you rang?
Yeah. I ran my theory on the domestic troubles with the Dempseys.
came up empty.
you didn't call me over here just to tell me that... did you?
no. Look at these.
these are photos of Ryan Dempsey's suicide. Gun on the floor.
half a bottle of bourbon in front of him.
it took the investigator just 20 minutes to call it.
do you see what I don't see? - Yeah, I do.
no gunshot residue on the guy's T-shirt.
gun had to be at least three feet away.
that's pretty tricky for a suicide.
even a 36-inch sleeve couldn't pull that off.
Ryan Dempsey was murdered.
all right, let's start by getting our own brains straight.
now that the smoke and tires have cleared, what do we know- really know- for sure.
well, we've got Ryan Dempsey, an S. F.F. fighter murdered, staged to look like a suicide.
cops found a. 38 special near the body with Dempsey's prints on it.
per his will, Dempsey's brain was on its way to being studied for CTE.
except somebody intercepted it and substituted another healthy brain.
enlisting Danny Clegg, who O. D.'d.
and Doc Eller, who was shot to death.
Why? I mean, let's say that the brain did get to where it's supposed to go.
it was studied and Dempsey had CTE.
so what? Wouldn't that be on him?
Pernin would still not want to have been associated with that.
Yeah, but enough to kill for?
maybe Dempsey's brain's hiding another secret?
keep going.
well, according to Clegg's tox panel, he O. D.'d on quite the drug cocktail, including DMT, right?
the instant painkiller.
Yeah, maybe the perfect lift to get him through a tough fight.
Pernin could be doping his fighters.
now, that might be worth covering up.
and also worth killing for.
you know something? I bet that Dempsey's brain might corroborate all of this, if we could just get it to pee in a cup.
am I supposed to know what this is?
well, you have a medical background. - Yeah, in sports medicine.
you know what DMT is?
schedule One drug - they don't test for that in the S. F.F.
this report tells us that Ryan Dempsey was taking DMT, as was Danny Clegg.
although I suspect that Clegg was suing it recreationally.
a little bump from his old trainer for doing him a solid.
why, why am I here, exactly?
well, you made a phone call to Danny Clegg the night that Dempsey died.
Yeah, Clegg is an old friend of mine. I got his number in my phone.
pocket dial. What do you want?
Oh, you pocket dialing the Dempsey home for the last four months, too?
exactly. So why were you calling when Ryan was at the gym?
his wife was not hard on the eyes. Were you tuning her up, too?
and Dempsey found out about it, right?
why'd you do this to me? - See the doctor...
you didn't think I'd find out?! - Stop it...!
the guy has CTE. There's only one way that's going to end.
a gun is a great equalizer.
Joyce Dempsey called you right after.
according to the phone records, you were still in Vegas.
two hours after that, you made a call to Dr. Eller and then 911 from Seneca.
you cleaned up the mess your girlfriend made, got your stories straight, and made arrangements.
now I get to make another call.
as a matter of fact, I do.
trying to soften me up, are you?
is it working? - No.
your coach called me this afternoon. He's worried about you.
he's worried about winning.
well, he's supposed to, Charlie. He's the coach.
so why did you miss curfew?
I was bouldering up at Mt. Charleston.
lost track of time. It was stupid.
I don't care what you were doing. I want to know why, Charlie.
it's just... the other players don't really get me.
it's different here, Dad.
Hey, you're the new kid on the team. Everybody thinks you're a little weird. Right?
well, join the club.
we are weird.
are you still having fun with basketball?
I love it.
good.
apologize to your coach... take your suspension with a smile.
and, next game, you bring it.
can you do that?
Yeah, I can do that.
good.
Hey, come here for a second, will you?
I promise, I promise, no more stories.
okay, what's up? - This is driving me crazy.
now why did Clegg order a number 17?
right? He was a nugget man.
he's high on drugs - he should have been thirsty, if anything.
well, you know what's driving me nuts? - What?
football. - Why?
cause I played a little football. I even got a game ball once.
they put my jersey number on it and everything.
and I still have that football; it's very important to me.
maybe this is Clegg's game ball, right?
and he hung on to it, and his life is passing before his eyes.
he starts thinking about the good times.
I don't know, man. I read Clegg's bio.
he didn't even play football.
Yeah, but Dempsey did.
maybe Dempsey gave Clegg his ball. - Why?
I don't - I don't know, man. Because they were good friends, I guess.
wait, wait, go back.
all right, so Clegg is supposed to be getting rid of his friend's brain for Pernin, right?
but three hours after the swap, he's still driving around with it.
maybe he's driving around with his friend's game ball for the same reason that he's driving around with his brain.
maybe he's not trying to help Pernin. Maybe he's trying to help his old friend.
you know what? There's a police station about - about two blocks from the Tasty Time.
I'll bet you anything that he was going to bust Pernin for drugs, and he died firSt. Right?
wait - whoa, what are you doing?
I think it's about time to figure out how this football plays into all this, don't you?
Yeah, what the hell. Go for it.
hold on.
I guess you never really know what's important.
print on the syringe got us a warrant to Pernin's house.
found this in his sock drawer.
let's see if his bullet matches the one that killed Eller.
fire one.
nice.
so we've got him dead to rights on the Eller murder.
but he won't flip on Joyce Dempsey.
well, I guess he has a large capacity for love.
Joyce Dempsey's one lucky woman.
want me to take a pass with the kid?
I got this one.
everybody, I'd like a little privacy.
thank you very much.
so remember when I told you I took a swing at my dad and I never felt better and never felt worse?
well, the better lasted, like, 15 seconds.
the worse... 40 years, and counting.
no one in this life is all good or all bad.
even my dad had a lot of good in him.
and I know you had a lot of good times with your dad, too.
now you got to try and help that dad.
the one who loved you.
did your dad and mom have a fight at the cabin about Mr. Pernin?
they were always fighting.
Yeah, but this time your mom fought with a gun, right?
come on, Deck... remember the good.
there were no good times.
all I can remember is being scared.
well, I'm sure your mom was scared, too.
he threw me down the stairs.
you didn't think I'd find out? Everyone knows!
he was choking my mom and screaming and calling her names.
but I couldn't stop him.
and I know you think my mom did it...
look, don't say another word.
I killed him.
Declan, no!
and, really, I've never felt better.
extended family meeting - now.
this is Agent McQuaid, Special Agent in charge Pratt.
they're with the FBI.
four weeks ago, in Pakistan, a warehouse guard was killed trying to stop a raid on U. S. military supplies.
the scene was processed by operatives working for Ceressus Logistics.
Laura? What are you doing here?
my husband is helping out on a case with the police and the FBI.
your husband's Mark Gabriel.
the sort of corruption you're implying is neither encouraged nor tolerated at Ceressus.
get down!
we know that Ceressus is implicated.
we just want to know how far up the ladder it goes.
I tell you everything, I want immunity.
Lenny Wesson died en route to a federal holding facility.
I heard something.
by accident. He's a good lawyer.
he's Sam's guy.
I think you might need that.
...but what's gonna happen is that you've got to come in here, we gotta have a face-to-face.
and that's what we're gonna do.
other than that...
right. This can't go anywhere. Yes.
Absolutely.
okay. All right, I will.
that's right.
right. He has one more client.
all right. I'll have him call you back.
Joey, please.
you disposed of a body, I disposed of the case.
Aw, geez...
a Mrs. Hobart is waiting.
last appointment of the day?
let me guess: Messy divorce?
contested will?
I'll let you be surprised.
I think we're okay on water...
excuse me.
excuse me, did you hear what I said?
we don't need any water.
the office is closed.
who called this in?
couple of campers, but, uh, they moved on.
Yeah, they didn't want to spend the rest of their camping trip talking to us.
well, based on the pelvic bones, I'd say one male, two female.
if I was going to kill three people, I'd want a little more privacy.
Yeah, this close to the road...
looks like a body dump to me.
well, looks like they've been here a while.
Dermestes maculatus.
hide beetles.
nature's cleaning crew.
depending on the weather conditions, they usually set up shop five to 11 days post-mortem.
so those guys should help narrow down the time of death.
Yeah, but a cold front and heavy rains blew through here a few days ago.
don't hide beetles hate the cold?
Yeah. They like the rain even less.
so...
these many bugs shouldn't still be here.
and there's no way these bodies should be this badly decomposed.
something's not right here.
bugs don't lie.
D. B. you may want to take a look at this.
Jane Doe Number One.
entry wound looks like a small caliber.
bullet is copper-washed.
looks like a . 22.
kill shot. She sustained at least five other GSWs.
four perforating, through-and-through, caliber unknown.
and one penetrated.
I pulled this bullet from the spinal column.
well, that's definitely not a . 22.
it's too long.
Xiomara will be able to tell us what it is.
you ever heard of anyone named Xiomara before?
no.
there was a Xiomara in my gross anatomy class.
and let me tell you, her anatomy was anything but gross.
if you know what I mean.
okay. I have bodies to wash.
indeed. - Yeah.
I found similar beveling in our other Jane and John Doe.
as far as I can tell, they both sustained five gunshot wounds to the torso.
all evenly spaced.
so Jane Doe Number One gets a kill shot to the head, and these other two got stitched across the chest.
very precisely. Looks professional.
I'll say this, all of our victims had excellent teeth.
served them well in life.
may serve us in death.
I'm sending these over to Henry to pulp and process.
DNA may give us an I. D.
we're here. What do you got?
I got your I. D.s.
victims were all in Missing Persons.
ladies first.
Amelia Gross, 52, receptionist.
and Julie Blanch, 28, paralegal.
both worked for...
Malcolm Turner, 64, attorney.
didn't he work for your father?
how long did you say those bodies were out there in the mountains?
Nick wasn't sure. He thought maybe a week or so. Why?
something wrong?
I hope not.
come on, Laura. Pick up.
come on, come on, come on, come on...
Laura, why are you here?
is it about Mark?
I'm scared.
sometimes...
I'm scared to even say something aloud...
voice mailbox full?
I took your advice.
I'm leaving Mark.
I talked to that lawyer.
he's arranging a meeting with the FBI.
I'm going to tell them everything I know.
...tell them everything I know.
you're doing the right thing.
where are you? Where are you?
do you need a place to stay?
I'm staying at our condo in town.
I want you to have a key.
just in case.
I went to Laura's condo.
her things were all there, but there was no sign of her.
and the doorman hadn't seen her since Saturday night?
no. - You really think something's happened to her.
I do.
and I think I know who's responsible.
well, we're about to find out if you're right.
thank you for coming in, Mr. Gabriel.
didn't think we'd cross paths so soon.
what's happened to my wife?
why don't you tell us?
I haven't seen Laura in two weeks, since she moved out of our place in Denver.
since she talked to the lawyer you sent her to.
Where'd she go?
she said she was staying at our condo here in Vegas for a while.
marriage not going so well?
that's between me and my wife.
well, now that she's missing, it's between you and LVPD.
no one is more concerned about finding Laura than I am.
I've been trying to reach her for days.
we know.
her voice mailbox is full of concerned messages.
you've been on the phone a lot.
not only to your wife, but to her lawyer, as well.
so? We've spoken on the phone...
not lately, I bet.
his office isn't taking any calls.
I came here because you said my wife was missing.
I came here to cooperate.
but I see this is going the same way my last interview here went.
so, let's end it the same way, shall we?
you can contact my attorneys.
son of a bitch killed her.
I don't like the guy any more than you do, but let's just back up for a second.
Malcolm Turner wasn't just any lawyer, the guy was a fixer.
he had enemies.
and as far as we know, your friend Laura might just have run away.
Yeah, she ran to Malcolm Turner.
I sent her there because of him.
we know that Mark Gabriel dumped guns on the streets of Vegas.
and we can't prove it.
because our best witness ended up dead.
Laura had information.
about what? About Gabriel's business?
she was afraid to say.
so we're still not sure, right?
I'm sure that it got her killed.
did you take their statements yet?
no, they, uh...
they lawyered up.
but I'm having a little trouble with their story anyway.
you know, I confirmed the weather conditions where we found the bodies.
now, given the cold and the rain, we really shouldn't have found any beetles out there at all.
and the condition of the bodies suggests that bugs had been eating on them for at least a week.
well, forget a week.
how about 14 hours? - What?
Vartann interviewed Malcolm Turner's widow.
she talked to her husband's receptionist around 8: 00 last night.
which means all our victims had to have been in the office around that time.
no, no - 8: 00 p. m. last night?
that's impossible.
the bodies were picked clean by this morning.
have you eaten lunch yet?
well, I hope they like it extra crispy.
no, they're actually a little bit smarter than we are.
they like it healthy, so I'll get the skin off here...
there you go.
bon apptit, gentlemen.
Now-now...now, wait a minute.
you know we can't eat in here, dude.
well, I won't tell Russell if you don't.
Yeah, okay, sounds like a deal.
surveillance confirms that Malcolm Turner and his staff arrived for work at 7: 48 a. m.
now, the phone logs say that they worked all day, and that they ordered lunch in.
no sign of them leaving?
Nope. Their cars are still in the garage.
so how'd they make the big reverse commute back to the mountains?
it does not look like they were killed here.
what? They just vanished?
janitorial came through at quarter to 9: 00.
they found the place locked, nobody here, and they saw nothing out of the ordinary.
I gotta get these guys to clean my place.
not a single smudge or print.
you know, the only janitor I know who's this thorough turned out to be a serial killer.
what do we know about this cleaning crew?
same guys who've been cleaning this office every night for the last seven years.
okay.
so, if these guys didn't give the place the white glove treatment, who did?
it's amazing.
they picked it clean in less than an hour.
Yeah. They eat even faster than you.
well, they eat faster than any hide beetles I've ever seen.
maybe that's why the decomp was inconsistent with T. O. D.
super beetles.
they're some kind of different, I'll say that.
question is... how?
genetic anomaly?
freaks of nature?
it's definitely an entomological mystery.
where did you come from, you little beasts?
this office is definitely our primary, but only you, me, the walls and the carpet know it.
and do you smell what I smell?
nothing. No bleach.
they used ethanol to destroy the DNA.
smart.
any blood, fingerprints, any trace of what happened in here is gone.
they even walked the bodies out of here without anybody noticing.
call log said the last call came in at 8: 07.
janitorial crew got here at quarter to 9: 00.
we're talking less than 45 minutes.
Russell said the hit was professional.
clean-up was professional, too.
who are these guys?
I checked surveillance covering the 45 minutes it took our bad guys to kill and clean.
according to Skadden Springs, there were no scheduled deliveries last night.
okay, so bogus delivery guy.
that's not the only thing that was bogus.
we were wondering how they got the bodies out.
I think I can answer that.
at 8: 02, three men delivered office furniture to the building.
and at 8: 47, just as the janitors were entering the legal office upstairs, the same three guys came back out...
with the exact same furniture.
maybe just a little heavier.
Oh, look!
there's our water guy again.
what do you want to bet, he was delivering ethanol?
jordan's Office Supply.
I ran it.
company doesn't exist.
these guys are good.
organized. Covert. Precise.
if I didn't know any better, I'd say they had military training.
Yeah, just like the army, every squad needs a squad leader.
four paths converged in a service area, and they took the path most traveled by...
What're you getting at?
walk these guys back out again.
Yeah, look at this.
"hello, boss." "Hey, nice work."
see, they're talking to each other.
"ah, well done." "Thanks, boss."
when was the last time you saw anyone wear a raincoat in Vegas?
I think I can answer that.
just after 8: 00 p. m. guy in the raincoat got on the elevator.
ten minutes later, he got off.
after the murders.
all right, so we got our cleaning crew and our hit team.
let's take a closer look at these guys.
pull their faces out of the crowd.
rest in peace, little man.
Hey, Nick. What's up?
well, that's just it.
I'm not real sure, and I can use your help.
okay? - Okay.
Greg and I did a little experiment with the beetles we found at the dump site.
they have an appetite unlike any other bug I've ever seen before.
check that out.
now...that explains how the bodies were picked clean in half a day, but doesn't explain this.
what am I looking at?
that's the beetle's equipment.
enhanced. - Obviously.
and completely useless.
well, my guess is, they were irradiated.
where are you going with this?
I think someone's bioengineering these bugs.
I know it sounds crazy, but it's like something has switched off their "I'm full" button, made them great eaters, bad breeders, so they'd do their job, and they just disappear.
along with their dinner.
Yeah.
pretty crazy, right?
no. No. That's...
actually, that's pretty consistent with Mark Gabriel and Ceressus.
that company is into all kinds of covert ops, weapons development, you name it.
ballistics came back on our victims.
the main caliber used was a 5.7 by 28.
that's the same caliber as the bullets that killed that ballistics expert last month, right?
that's the same caliber as the assault rifles that went missing in Pakistan and ended up here in Vegas.
but I thought we got all those off the streets.
apparently not.
okay, but Mark Gabriel claimed he had nothing to do with those guns.
Yeah, just like he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance.
so who you calling now?
the FBI.
look.
I'm sorry, a few bullets and bugs isn't enough for us to put the target back on Mark Gabriel.
what about his wife and her lawyer coming forward?
Laura Gabriel was coming to you with information.
so the FBI is brought in on a case, and nobody thinks to call me?
Yeah, actually, no, it was my bad.
I-I called them.
I should've given you a heads-up.
okay. The heads-up can start now.
you remember Special Agents Pratt and McQuaid.
you're working the Ceressus case.
and they just agreed to provide background that might help us out on our current investigation.
isn't that right?
that's about right.
because the truth is, you wouldn't have responded quickly to my phone call if you didn't think that Mark Gabriel was guilty of more than gunrunning.
right?
we've had reason to believe that Ceressus's been engaged in a number of illegal activities here in the U. S.
what illegal activities exactly are you talking about?
full disclosure.
that would be refreshing.
we've been looking at Mark Gabriel for almost a year now.
we believe that Ceressus is heavily involved in gunrunning, corporate espionage, computer hacking - the list goes on.
bringing their international expertise to a domestic market.
corporations. Cartel. Whoever's got the highest bid.
how about murder for hire?
okay. I guess we take that as a yes.
okay. What have you got?
a lot more than you think.
you know these people?
Yeah, we've seen them before, but we haven't been able to connect them to Ceressus or Mark Gabriel.
I mean, the guy doesn't make mistakes.
thank you for the full disclosure. As for the mistakes, I beg to differ.
he made three.
I'm sorry about your friend.
me, too.
look, I was going to call you, but...
it's probably better that you didn't.
maybe we could...
we've got work to do.
Yeah.
who was that?
he's Jim McQuaid with the FBI.
they're cooperating on the Gabriel case.
I ran down Laura Gabriel's financials.
she closed out her bank account five days ago.
withdrew $28, 000.
sounds like she was scared.
maybe she tried to go on the run.
well, I don't think she got far.
activity on her cell phone stopped the day before the hit at the law office.
you all right?
I will be. When we nail Gabriel.
mom.
what are you doing here?
I asked the desk. They said it was okay.
well, that's okay, but why are you here?
this came in my mail, but the card was meant for you.
Catherine, sorry I couldn't make it. I tried. David Campbell.
I know. Laura's father.
I-I-I... I don't understand.
the man died 20 years ago.
Catherine, what is going on?
did something happen to Laura?
has anyone else touched this?
just me, the mailman and now you.
I'm going to have someone escort you home.
card's the same story as the envelope.
besides you and your mom, just partials;
nothing usable.
I'll swab it for DNA.
Laura mailed the card a day before the murders at the law office and sent it directly from a post office in Pahrump.
she wanted to make sure you got it.
and make sure that Gabriel didn't intercept it.
that's why she sent it to my mom.
you really think Mark Gabriel is reading your mail?
I wouldn't put anything past him.
you and Laura close?
Yeah. At one time, yeah.
when we were kids, Laura's house was like my second home.
until Sam, her dad was like the closest thing I had to a father.
we were like sisters.
this card play music when you got it?
well, no, but I just assumed it wasn't working.
well, I think I know why you got cheated out of a birthday song.
this is a cell phone memory card.
so I ran the memory card.
it's not Laura's.
it's registered to Mark Gabriel.
and this is all that's on it?
Ah, pictures of the Gabriels over the last year.
why would Laura go to all that trouble to send me vacation photos?
if you didn't know any better, you'd think they had a pretty wonderful life.
you know, there was one picture, though, that seemed a little out of place.
show me. - Yeah.
some kind of weird self-portrait.
En-Enlarge it, please.
Yeah.
I know that house.
I've been there when I was a kid.
that's Laura's cousin's house.
LVPD!
blowflies.
copper in the air.
is it Laura?
it's Laura's cousin Helen...
and Helen's husband.
both shot in the head.
she took a beating.
so where's Laura?
when we were kids, we played here.
Laura's granddad grew up in the Depression.
didn't trust banks.
so, when he built this house, he made sure that he would never need any banks to keep his money safe.
Laura Gabriel's alive?
Yeah. We found her hiding in a crawl space under the house.
Catherine's talking to her right now.
you think it's the same crew that hit the law office?
Oh, it doesn't look like it. The place is a mess.
unless they're losing their touch.
maybe they got interrupted.
okay.
uh, finish processing the scene.
I'll let the FBI guys know.
I got it.
it happened so fast.
I heard them break in.
Helen told me to hide.
they had Derek.
they were yelling at him.
Helen was screaming.
please don't shoot him! No!
next thing I know, they were shouting at her.
hitting her.
please...
and then...She wouldn't tell them.
they were beating her, and she still wouldn't tell them anything.
could you tell how many there were?
no. I heard one of them.
he got a phone call.
sounded like he had an accent.
after that, they left.
when I heard footsteps again, I thought they'd come back.
I was sure that they'd find me.
but it was you.
what is it that you know that has Mark so worried?
remember when I told you I overheard something?
one night, Mark was in the study with a man.
they were talking about cleaning the offices of Stanley Merrill.
why do I know that name?
stanley Merrill was a military contractor, rival of Mark's.
went missing 11 months ago.
mark killed him.
I know it.
you're here, so I'm assuming you got the card I sent?
Yeah, and the memory card with the photo that you took.
you knew that I'd recognize the house.
there were more photos on that memory card.
Yeah, the vacation photos.
more than that.
what do you mean?
when Mark conducted business, he always swapped out the memory card on his phone.
that one was in his pocket. I took it.
I know Mark.
there has to be something more.
there really is nothing more tedious than to have to sit through a slide show of somebody else's vacation photos.
my mother went to Anguilla over Christmas with her new boyfriend.
he's a regular Ansel Adams.
I sat through four hours of sand, sea and sunset.
I didn't know your mom had a new boyfriend.
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.
good. Me, neither.
what are you doing?
Catherine thinks there's some kind of information hidden in these images.
steganography.
the art of embedding data within data.
so I'm analyzing the noise levels to see if there are any data packets embedded in these pixels.
have you checked the noise levels on this marlin?
no, not yet. Haven't gotten there. Why?
well, I'm no expert, but this little Punxsutawney Phil of the sea isn't seeing his shadow.
you're right - no shadow.
this fish has been Photoshopped.
these noise levels are off the charts.
there's definitely data embedded in this fish.
let's gut it.
running it through steganalysis decryption...
now.
numbers.
could be a code? - Yeah.
so, Mr. Martens, is there a reason why Mark Gabriel sent his number two instead of coming here himself?
Mr. Gabriel had an important conference.
he sends his regrets.
I'm sure he does.
so, as the CFO of Ceressus, you're the money guy.
and legal counsel.
what's this about?
well, we went on a little, uh, fishing expedition, and we found a bunch of numbers embedded in this image right here.
first, we thought that they were code, but then we realized that they were actually numbers and dates of transactions.
recording monies being wired from a subsidiary of Ceressus to a single account in a Swiss bank.
where did you get this information?
Ah, well, that's all very cloak-and-dagger.
but here's where it gets interesting.
the actual dates of the transactions.
pratt: 11 months ago, your boss's rival, Stanley Merrill, disappears.
and money goes to Switzerland.
I don't know anything about that.
four weeks ago, Lenny Wesson, witness against Ceressus, dies in custody.
and money goes to Switzerland.
these numbers are meaningless.
four days ago, Malcolm Turner, lawyer to your boss's wife, who'd agreed to come forward with information, is murdered.
once again, the Swiss economy gets a shot in the arm.
now... I know that your law degree is telling you that we don't have enough to make a case, but sooner or later, someone's going to talk.
and my common sense degree tells me sooner would be a lot better for you.
look, I have no knowledge of this subsidiary of Ceressus, and I don't know anything about these transactions.
all right. You know them?
these men?
no.
this man, I'm sorry to say, I do.
who is he?
a contractor who's done work for Ceressus abroad.
what kind of work?
I think you know the answer.
to my knowledge, we've never called on his expertise for any assignments in this country, nor would I ever sanction it.
well, sounds to me like someone left you holding the bag.
or perhaps given me reason to cooperate.
I'm going to need cover.
okay.
now we're getting someplace.
I've got some good news.
you're not going to be alone in coming forward.
what do you mean?
someone else has agreed to cooperate with the FBI.
who?
well, I can't say.
but what I can say is that you're going to get through this.
I hope so.
for all our sakes.
Yeah. - Sir...
I can't let you in here.
I have the right to see my wife.
actually, Mr. Gabriel, you don't.
Mr. Gabriel, I'm gonna have to ask you to stay out here.
get him the hell out of here.
that's my wife!
she's a witness.
and she's going to bury you.
no, you're the one trying to bury me.
Oh, if I was going to bury you, I'd put you in the ground where they'd never find you.
Really? Is that a threat?
do you need help finding the door?
we're not done.
everything's going to work out, you'll see.
thank you.
she's scared.
Yeah, well...
she's got reason.
wish I could say it'll go away with time, but I'd be lying.
you can never completely outrun your past.
I'm never going to see her again.
what about you?
well, it's your call.
transport team's here.
don't worry...
I'll be with her the whole time.
name's Paul Obrecht, 54.
german native.
emigrated to the U. S. when he was 16.
according to the Ceressus file we got off Gabriel's number two, Obrecht served in the military.
army Special Forces.
honorable discharge, 1989.
at which point, he became a soldier-for-hire.
assignments in Africa, the Mideast, South America.
and now, apparently, here in the U. S. working for Mark Gabriel.
Laura said that the man that Gabriel hired to kill Stanley Merrill, the man that she heard at her cousin's house, had an accent.
these guys are pros.
Yeah, but they're not infallible.
and their loyalty is only to themselves.
right.
so, if we catch them, maybe we can get them to flip on Gabriel.
right.
FBI sent over the case file on Stanley Merrill's disappearance.
putting our bad guys there, too.
same cast of characters.
including one we overlooked at the law firm.
and at Stanley Merrill's office 11 months ago.
push in on the woman's face.
I just saw her.
where?
at the hospital. She's on the FBI transport detail.
how long ago did you lose contact?
Jim, we've got a situation.
come on, Pratt, all your vehicles have GPS, right?
where? When?
no, Willows identified her.
she's on the hit team, I'm sure of it.
are you sure? - Well, keep me in the loop.
LVPD found them.
sorry, guys, the FBI's got this one.
what happened?
evidence on the ground suggests an ambush.
they took out the lead car.
the FBI guys never saw it coming.
and the car with Laura Gabriel and Agent McQuaid?
they tried to evade the shooters.
driver was hit first.
and then Laura and McQuaid.
and then they torched the car.
any witnesses?
no. But I found these.
seen those before.
hope they were dead before the fire...
...probably a guy or two down here.
trying to figure out if the convoy was off course or not, or if it was driven into this ambush...
how could you let this happen?!
CSI Willows, please.
how could you allow an assassin to infiltrate your protection team and got four agents and my friend killed?!
this is not the time.
Catherine, let's let them do their job, okay?
Oh, it's a little late for that.
this should be our crime scene.
you should be on the phone getting everybody down here!
all hands on deck!
Hey, hey, hey, listen. I know how you're feeling right now, believe me.
I'm going to give you some advice someone gave me once.
walk away.
right now.
walk away?!
Yes, go to the office, leave your notes on my desk, and then go home.
just like that?
Yeah, just like that.
don't let her drive herself.
do you want me to come in?
it's probably not a good idea.
well, if you need anything, call me. Okay?
Thanks.
you deserve more, Lou.
get in!
hurry up! Come on, come on!
here they come!
go! Go!
you okay?
I'll live.
you ever seen anything like that?
I don't even know what I'm looking at.
that's just wrong.
lucky for you, for this type of crisis.
it's a mercy killing on a burrito this bad.
whoa, whoa, whoa, girl. You sure about that?
control, this is CSI Brody.
we've got a single-car collision, Tropicana, block east of Nash, injuries.
paramedics are on their way.
he's got a pulse, but he's lost a lot of blood.
he's got a really nasty head wound here.
we've gotta move. Engine's going up.
all right, I'm gonna try to get him out of here.
come on, boy, I got you. - I'll get his legs.
come on. Come on.
okay...
get him far enough back now. - I'm trying.
Ah, that's good, that's good.
Wes Clyborn. Seven Hills address.
Wes, Wes, my name's Nick.
you hang in there now. Help's on the way.
damn. - What?
he didn't hit his head. This is a gunshot wound.
I didn't hear a shot before the crash.
I definitely didn't hear two. I think that's a second GSW to the abdomen.
looks like the same caliber.
They're-they're-they're bleeding.
what are you trying to say, Wes?
they're dying.
who's dying, Wes? Wes, talk to me.
who's dying?
grab those doors for us?
hang in there, Wes.
you're in good hands now, bud. They're gonna take care of you.
we've got a GSW to head and abdomen.
okay. Get him on the monitor. Full set of stat labs.
type and cross for packed red cells for transfusion.
we have O-neg standing by.
16 or 18 gauge.
excuse me, Nurse, I'm with the Crime Lab.
I'm gonna need to take the clothes he's wearing with me, okay?
I'll see what I can do.
prep him for a central line.
code blue. He's in V-Tach.
okay. Clear the room.
that includes you, Crime Lab.
Yes, sir.
thank you.
morgan called. Told me you'd followed the victim here.
wow, look at you. You all right?
uh, yeah. I'm fine.
but, man, this guy's in really bad shape.
and here's the thing.
he said that there are others, and that they're dying or dead.
I'm not really sure what to make of it.
so you think there's another crime scene out there?
maybe more victims, too, you know what I mean?
okay.
why don't you clean yourself up. I took the liberty of bringing you a shirt from your locker.
Thanks.
you hang here, if our guy pulls through, maybe he'll tell you something.
more than just "thank you."
Hey, Nick...
way to go.
that took a lot of guts.
Thanks.
registration belongs to Elena Perez, 35.
Vartann's checking out her address.
no known employer.
looks like she's been living here.
blood on the headrest is from transfer from Wes Clyborn's head wound.
no high-velocity blood spatter. No gunshot.
no HV on my side, either.
significant blood pool on the driver's seat.
probab from the shot to the abdomen.
that's a lot of blood.
so... not shot in the car.
Shotefore he got in the car.
losing blood, losing consciousness, he runs into the billboard tru
you know, considering his condition, he couldn't have gotten more than a mile or two.
couple of square miles... and still a lot of ground to cover.
our primary could be anywhere.
crime Lab.
well, I'm Nick. Stokes.
what's your name? - I'm Lauren.
Lauren, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
Yeah, thanks for your help. - Sure.
I have the patient's clothing for you.
okay. Good.
sorry. Got a little scissory.
Oh, that's okay.
so... how's he doing?
he's good. Out of surgery. Stable.
the doctor removed this from Mr. Clyborn's abdomen.
fortunately, internal damage was minimal.
only one bullet?
the one that penetrated his brain's gonna require more attention.
a neurosurgeon's flying in from L. A.
you've done this before.
Yeah, more times than any one person should have to.
the owner of the Grand Am, Elena Perez, was evicted from her place a month ago.
and no one has reported her missing.
so I'm working on a warrant for her cell phone records.
that might be the only way to track her down.
what about the cell phone that Nick recovered from the victim?
Yeah, Wes Clyborn. He's a popular guy.
I traced most of the calls to his friends.
and no one has ever heard of Elena Perez, and nobody knew where he was last night.
one thing, though-- the last few calls, they were all made to the same number.
do we know who?
there's no way to know. It was a "pay-as-you-go" cell.
Oh, great. So totally untraceable.
bullet entered the left middle temporal lobe. Houses the hippocampus and related structures.
those are areas related to his memory, right?
right.
generally, retrograde amnesia exhibits a temporal gradient.
last in, first out.
so things he learned in school, his mother's name, sense memories, there's a good chance they remain.
but the memory of who shot him last night...
may or may not be there.
okay. So is he conscious?
fully.
soon as the neurosurgeon arrives, we prep him for surgery, take him in.
what are his chances?
I don't think we'll know till we get in there.
so if you're going to talk to him, do it now.
appreciate it.
look at that. He's conscious.
how you doing, man? You look good.
thank you.
Yeah.
no.
thank you.
the nurse said you saved me.
Yeah.
you don't remember any of that, huh?
no. I'm sorry.
wait, you don't have to apologize to me, man.
you got a massive head wound. It's gonna take some time.
so it's bad if the beeps stop, right?
it's not good, no.
but don't worry about that. That's not gonna happen.
do me a favor, Wes.
let me see your hands.
if you were in a struggle with somebody, we might be able to find something that can help us out here.
Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.
Ooh, looks like you put up a hell of a fight.
why would anyone want to hurt our son?
did someone try and rob him?
we don't know that, sir. That's what we're trying to find out.
you guys have any idea where he was last night?
no.
well, do you know who he might've been with?
Wes has a lot of friends.
okay. But he still lives at home th you, right?
Yeah, since he graduated in May. From 'SC.
he's still exploring his options.
we give Wes his space. He comes and he goes.
not much more we could tell you.
except that he's a good boy.
do you recognize this woman?
no. Why?
name's Elena Perez. She's the owner of the car that Wes was driving.
I've never seen her before.
you're sure she's not a friend of his?
I've seen enough of Wes's friends to know this woman would definitely not fit in with any of them.
now, if you'll excuse us... we'd like to see our son.
dad's not exactly Mr. Warmth, is he?
I think I found our other victims...
the ones the guy in the hospital was talking about.
what do you mean found them? Where?
here. They're all over his shirt.
no surprise I found the victim's blood. But I found three other contributors.
three other people.
I know.
is Elena Perez one of them?
based on exemplars from her car, yes.
what about the other two?
one is male. Familial match to Elena.
I ran it through CODIS and got a hit on her brother, Juan Perez.
convictions for assault, armed robbery... and, oh, yeah, carjacking.
paroled six months ago.
what about the last contributor?
unknown female.
look at all that carnage.
wonder what the hell happened right before Wes Clyborn got in that car?
I don't know.
I can't get you any closer to the primary.
I don't have any answers about what might have happened or how. Or why.
all I have is blood.
sometimes blood is all you need.
Oh, boy. Wish me luck.
where are you going?
we need a blood whisperer.
no signs of forced entry.
victim probably knew her assailant.
could have been a hotel employee who had a key... who had access.
M. E. estimates time of death around midnight.
C. O.D. is blunt force trauma, consistent with the claw hammer.
Yeah.
you're killing me. Tell me something I don't know.
guys, your bosses are paying me a lot of money for this seminar.
come on!
okay, I'll give you a hint.
look at my body.
the position of my body.
right, sorry, got it, um...
your hand appears to be extending outward.
good, good. Why is that significant?
look at the blood smear.
I've made a blood angel here. Why?
well, at first blush, it looks like you're trying to reach your cell phone that fell under the lamp there, but the blood angel shows that your arm stopped, so you didn't get the phone.
you didn't call 911.
you got any ideas?
the assailant's still in the room.
she's afraid to call.
Jules, what do you say?
I say he's close, and there's only one person in the world who would dare to call me Jules.
okay, guys, that's a 482. We'll pick up after lunch.
I know what you're thinking.
of all the mock crime scenes in all the world...
no, that is not what I'm thinking.
it's good to see you. I like your scene.
are you on the registration list? - Uh, no.
because I know you don't like to make social calls unless, of course, you want to make your wife happy, and I don't see her around.
so what do you want, Mr. Russell?
straight to the point, as usual.
okay, uh... I need a little help.
open case-- blood's all we got, but, oh, it's a good one.
we know how it ended last time.
Yes, yes, that's true, uh, but this is just one case.
I'm already working a crime scene.
you sure? - Yeah.
okay. Well, worth a shot.
Oh, yeah, uh, before I go, I almost forgot.
the assailant was still in the room, uh, but your arm was reaching out but not to grab your cell phone but to motion to your daughter to tell her to stay hidden.
I know you... you think you hate me, but the whole, uh, lying on the floor, playing the victim thing kind of says you miss me.
or not.
okay.
Lauren. Got your message.
what's going on?
it's Wes Clyborn.
is he all right?
he's a little worked up.
what do you mean? Why?
I don't know, he won't talk to me. Keeps asking for you.
all right, cool, I'll talk to him.
Thanks.
Hey, it's good to see your appetite.
but you didn't eat the Jell-O.
I remember something.
okay. Remember something from last night?
I was in a room.
a room. What kind of room? Do you recognize it?
no, I'd never been there before, but th-there was a man.
and he had a gun.
you recognize him, know his name?
no.
was it that dude?
I tried to fight this guy off.
don't worry about it. He had a gun.
next thing I remember, I was running.
I had car keys, but they weren't mine.
I-I took her car.
her? Do you mean Elena? Elena Perez?
I don't know.
it's all right. Is that her?
Yeah, yeah, sh-she was there, but... th-th-there was somebody else, another girl.
who?
I can see her, she... She was beautiful.
you, uh, you hadhis pendant in your pocket.
you were carrying it around. It must be important.
think it was hers?
Vicky? Her name is Vicky? - Yeah.
all right, all right, that's good. That's going to help us out.
listen, Wes... you and I are going to figure this out together.
we're gonna find Vicky and we're gonna find out who did this to you. I promise.
Hey, ran ballistics on the bullet that was pulled out of Wes Clyborn's stomach.
it matches a round fired at a liquor store robbery four weeks ago.
perp's still out there along with the gun.
liquor store robbery would match Juan Perez's M. O.
and grabbing up two rich kids at gunpoint fits with what Nick has gotten from Wes Clyborn up to this point.
so does Henry's DNA report.
the bullet had Wes Clyborn's DNA.
well, that makes sense.
it also had tissue that belongs to our unknown female.
well, that means...
the bullet traveled through our unknown female...
before landing in Wes Clyborn.
Clyborn says he remembers a girl named Vicky.
she was with him when he was shot. Girlfriend maybe.
through-and-through. The tissue on the bullet says it wasn't a head shot.
she could still be alive.
she hasn't called for help.
well, maybe she can't. Maybe she's still being held.
bleeding out on a floor somewhere.
Wes might have been the lucky one.
think you're getting kind of forgetful.
must be all of that Zen master living-in-the-moment stuff.
Yeah.
at least you remembered to put on socks.
did you take a look at it?
Yes, I did.
it is a good one.
Yeah. So?
I want to have some ground rules. - Okay.
all right, number one, you are not to call me Jules in front of other people.
it is Finn. - Finn.
number two, we are never going to talk about the past.
sounds to me like you want to live in the moment.
and when that Zen crap starts, we need to have a safe word.
pick one.
"stop." Would that work?
you got it.
all right. And what about you-- do you have any rules?
I'm gonna have to hire you on a temporary basis, uh, as a consultant.
I've already run that by HR. - Of course you have.
and... legally, we need to pay you a consulting fee.
figured the case was so fascinating, you'd want to do it for nothing.
you know me so well.
and you know blood better than anybody I know.
all right, I want your best DNA person.
I don't want your best tech. I want your best mind.
you got it.
you got me.
Wow. The case file did not do this justice.
Sanders, right?
uh, Greg.
you know, I get the whole E. R. urgency over evidence thing, but did you cut out all these samples?
no. But if I were still working DNA, I would have.
no, no, no, it's not you. DNA is king these days, but people don't understand that blood spatter can often tell you more than any test tube.
Russell says you're the man.
Oh, did he?
I try my best.
God, I hope somebody got some pictures before the DNA moths got to this.
great.
we're not totally screwed.
Yeah, we're pretty good about using cameras around here.
okay, we're going to reconstruct all the blood events on these clothes and we're gonna map every inch by DNA contributor.
I have the DNA reports right here.
Oh, good.
Oh, do you have a dummy?
wow, you truly are the Blood Whisperer.
stop.
okay, so we've got five blood events.
my logic suggests a certain order.
okay, let it bleed.
all right, so your victim remembers a struggle with Juan Perez.
here is Juan's blood on Wes's shirt.
pattern indicates blunt force trauma, close quarters combat.
but I don't think that Juan was the only one in there fighting.
so... brother and sister were both mixing it up with Wes.
both getting their blood on him, and then, according to Wes, Juan goes ballistic-- literally-- firing a bullet...
through our unknown female and into Wes.
okay, so that could be girlfriend Vicky.
could be.
here's her HV spatter from the through-and-through.
of course, nothing says "fight over" like a good shot to the head.
and so do the gravitational drops from Wes's head shot, leaving the final blood-soaked area from the abdominal gunshot wound.
nice job.
thank you.
so... our kid wrestles with two assailants, gets shot twice.
but how the hell did he get out of there?
maybe he was left for dead.
well, that does not bode well for Vicky.
I talked to Juan Perez's PO. He hasn't heard from Juan in a week.
no current address and no job on file.
on the bright side, I think I found Vicky.
Really? How'd you do that so fast?
I just did a web search, man.
I punched in Vickys with a connection to Wes Clyborn.
of course.
I think I got a lot more than I bargained for.
a newsletter from Jonah Clyborn's financial firm?
take a look at the Christmas candids.
former assistant to John Clyborn, filed for unemployment two months ago.
it looks like she's hoing onto the boss pretty tight before he let her go.
Yeah, maybe because she found another Clyborn to hang onto.
what do you mean?
I went by Vicky Sheldon's place; she wasn't there.
landlord said that he hasn't seen her the past 24 hours, but he has seen plenty of Wes Clyborn the last few months.
well, maybe this Juan Perez dude graduated from carjacking to hit man.
and maybe my next search turns up a connection between him and the dad.
you really think the old man would put out a hit on his own son?
Hey, over a woman?
anything's possible, I guess.
look, you said it yourself, right? This guy isn't exactly Mr. Warmth.
no. No, he's not.
Mr. Clyborn?
thank you for coming down.
I know you've already spoken to my colleagues at the hospital, but I just have a few more questions for you.
what about?
she worked for you as your personal assistant for over a year.
that is, right up until... two weeks ago, when she was fired.
Vicky was one of several personal assistants.
Yeah, but probably the only one who's dating your son. Am I right?
news to me.
so, that wasn't the reason why she got her pink slip?
and... how long have you known about the relationship?
Wes told me about it a month ago.
do you approve?
Wes is an adult. He makes his own decisions.
that wasn't a yes.
honestly, I think she was using my son.
how's that?
while Vicky was employed by my husband,
I learned that Wes was supplementing her wages with checks drawn from Jonah's business account.
I told Jonah to fire her.
Mrs. Clyborn, are you sure that Wes was the one that was paying her bills?
what exactly are you suggesting?
okay, let's see. Three days ago, a car crashed into the wall outside of Vicky Sheldon's home.
just barely missed going through her picture window. - So?
so... by the time the police arrived, both the car and the driver were gone.
and Vicky didn't want to talk about it, and nobody saw anything but the car.
not many fender-busted Bentleys get sold for scrap around here.
Oh, yeah, and, um, car's registered in your name.
I wasn't driving it.
Wes told me he hit a fire hydrant.
well, that's got to be a little infuriating.
more engine than he could handle.
no, I mean, kid lives at home, spends your money, wrecks your car.
late at night, outside the home of your ex... assistant.
that's got to grind at you.
I know you aren't accusing me of something.
if Wes wanted to go slumming with the help, that was his prerogative.
kid didn't deserve to get killed over it.
but that's on him. Not me.
new lab coats.
although, I ordered periwinkle, not royal blue.
they're not for you.
this work smock is from the trunk of Elena Perez's car.
and this one, I just found searching Vicky Sheldon's apartment.
Vicky and Elena worked together?
identical smocks.
and they definitely know each other.
I found Elena's number written on a note in Vicky's place.
working with a lady who's living in her car.
that's a doozy of a drop from Vicky's previous job.
so maybe Vicky wanted to cushion the fall with some Clyborn money.
got Juan and Elena to help her rob Wes, the rip-off went bad, and Wes escaped?
"Laverne and Shirley" gone femme fatale. Love it.
and I would love to know where those smocks were employed.
can you please check them for trace? Any answer could help us find our primary.
finally got cell phone records for Wes, Juan and Elena last night.
last calls were made at the same time in the same vicinity.
got the cell phone towers.
let's see where the coverage overlaps.
overlap places all three callers...
here.
arroyo Horizons Business Park.
why would they all be there on a Saturday night?
LVPD.
site manager said this was the only facility that wasn't locked down.
got blood. Shoe impression.
Yep.
looks like it's coming from back there.
body's cold. She's been here for a while.
same story here.
it's hard to tell from what's left of her face.
what the hell happened in here?
well, it's not like Wes Clyborn can really help us out right now.
no, but I know who can.
Yeah, the only guy we know who walked out of here.
he's got a lot to answer for.
fabulous Las Vegas.
not so fabulous for her.
Elena Perez's car said she was down on her luck.
looks like her luck ran out.
still in full rigor.
T. O.D. is approximately 18 to 24 hours ago.
same time frame as this poor girl.
Vicky Sheldon, GSW through and through.
there's quite a blood pool here.
bullet probably severed her left hepatic artery.
well, if that's the case, she lost consciousness and then bled out rather quickly.
got off easy compared to her friend.
massive blunt force trauma.
nearly every bone in her face is smashed.
overkill. Rage.
the wounds show a distinctive pattern.
could be brass knuckles maybe.
maybe.
but how do you explain the punctures?
I might be able to answer that question.
brass knuckles included.
could have a partial palm print here.
looks like what happened in Las Vegas kind of stayed on Las Vegas.
well, I see your palm print, and I raise you a knee impression and a footprint.
what kind of shoes was Wes Clyborn wearing?
uh, dress shoes. Why?
these aren't dress shoes. They're work boots.
and they look like they are hauling ass out of here.
right out the back door.
work boots weren't the only thing hauling ass.
tire treads.
got some paint. Could be transfer.
it looks like we've got some trace here.
white and crusty.
not much different than what's in your fridge.
sodium bicarbonate.
trace from the boot print is baking soda?
specifically, the chemical formulation used in industrial cleaning supplies.
still pretty generic. Doesn't get us any closer to tracking Juan.
well, if you want unique, I've got just your color.
royal crimson metallic.
auto paint transfer from the loading bay at the crime scene.
used exclusively on one vehicle model, Austin Healy B-100.
from 1955 to 1957.
that's a hell of a nice car.
I don't see Juan Perez owning it.
maybe he was working on it.
soda blasting.
sodium bicarbonate applied through compressed air.
used by auto-detailing places to prep a car that's about to be repainted.
perhaps with royal crimson metallic.
maybe Juan borrowed the car.
if you owned a classic ride like a '56 Austin Healy, I doubt you'd take it to the corner body shop.
no. I'd go to the best to pimp my ride.
that guy there.
LVPD.
your parole officer's been looking for you.
so have we.
I guess you found me.
that had to hurt.
maybe you can fix that dent before we take you downtown.
what took you so long?
I've been busy today.
we recovered Juan Perez's gun. We're running it.
well, I can tell you right now that Juan fired that gun.
all right.
blood pools from Wes Clyborn's two gunshot wounds.
he was shot standing, falls.
Blee from the head and the gut.
and over here, HV spatter, another blood pool.
which comes from Vicky Sheldon's GSW, the through-and-through, which ends up in Wes.
okay, so, bang, bang.
two gunshot victims.
efficient, expedient.
nothing in common... with this.
the beating of Elena Perez.
Yeah. Look at all of that blood.
not efficient. Not expedient.
no. I calculated roughly ten to 12 blows to the head with the murder weapon.
and then this knee impression.
at first, I thought that it was the killer.
but the void from the castoff and spatter is actually on the other side of her.
so, the killer was on this side, which means that the knee impression was not from the killer.
it was from somebody who came after the beating.
maybe somebody who wanted to help.
somebody like a brother.
where are you going with this?
Juan may have pulled the trigger, but I don't think he was the trigger.
it's a little Zen.
okay, so, our current assumption is that Juan Perez held Wes Clyborn here at gunpoint, right?
right.
so, let me ask you a question.
you're an ex-con with a gun at my back.
okay.
and you are ready to use it.
Where's my safe word?
you don't need one. You have a gun... and I don't.
and all of this blood says that I managed to punch you in the face, not once, but over half a dozen times.
a rich kid takesown an ex-con with a gun?
how does that happen?
it doesn't.
you make a good case.
Juan Per's blood makes the case.
he may have walked out with that gun, but I don't think he brought it.
doesn't look good, Juan.
career criminal running from the cops, gun with your prints found in your work locker.
so why all the talk?
I mean, you got me, and you got the gun.
and ballistics confirms that you used it against Wes Clyborn and Vicky Sheldon.
if you don't mind, I have one question.
am I going to give it up, right?
why el you think I'm sitting here without some half-asleep, court-appointed, public pretender sitting next to me?
that wasn't my question.
we have your sister Elena's cell phone records that shows that she called you the night of the murders.
my question is, why?
why do you think?
I think she needed you because she was scared for herself and her friend Vicky, whose ex had been calling her all night long.
he tried to ram his car through her apartment a couple of days before that, but now he had a bigger head of steam going.
he wanted what was his...
and he came for it.
it's over!
you got that part right.
what's going on?
how am I doing so far?
you were just trying to protect your sister.
you just didn't count on the rich boy having brought a street gun to the party.
you came to, you saw Wes beating your sister, and you had to stop him.
you had to protect the family.
get off her!
Juan, put the gun down, please!
you had no other choice.
your sister was already dead.
you knew how things would look, so you ran.
this is your lucky day.
there's the pen, and there's the paper.
write it down.
Yeah, I was always the troublemaker.
life wasn't fair, so I made it fair.
but Elena never complained.
Elena worked hard.
Elena had faith.
and the one time that she needed me-- someone like me...
I failed her.
how the hell do you know what went on in that room?
I have a very smart friend.
she's your friend, too.
give us a minute, will you?
tried to take my hallway walk.
cops wouldn't let me leave.
I'm not going home... am I?
no.
did I hurt Vicky?
you hurt 'em all, Wes.
two people are dead because of you.
I remembered something this morning.
I loved her.
I know I did.
the person you say did this...
I don't even know him.
neither do I, man.
that was very nicely done.
you did all the work.
I did, didn't I?
and here's your... dollar back.
like you said, I'm not really in it for the money.
don't you ever miss it?
I mean, you've been out of the game now, how long?
you know how long.
you want back in?
you asking?
Oh, come on. Don't make me beg.
I like it when you beg.
I have my own envelope.
my expenses.
party table rental, two smocks, some paints. It's all in there.
come on. What do you think?
I don't know. I really don't know.
okay.
I will think about it.
I may call you.
I may answer.
nobody calls me Diebenkorn around here. It's D. B.
so, uh...you are dating that nurse.
kind of.
and what happened to Doc Robbins' niece?
Oh, nothing. I'm just keeping my options open.
I called her, genius.
she's not answering her cell phone. Why do you think I called you people?
you know what?
I want to talk to your boss. I want to talk to him now.
she's busy.
she.
all right, what's going on, Mitch?
meet Dwayne Hicks.
he reported his wife missing.
he's all yours.
Mr. Hicks, I'm Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle.
we're with the crime scene unit.
when's the last time you saw your wife?
last night.
Debbie and I had an early dinner and then I went to work.
and where do you work?
what the hell does that have to do with you finding my wife?
are you refusing to answer the question? - Okay, look...
Mr. Hicks... we're just trying to help you out, man.
all right. I work as a night manager at the Swift Deal, okay?
all right. And, uh... where was the last place that you saw Debbie?
Deb... yeah, Debbie. At home.
you want to know what we ate, too?
um... which house is yours?
five twenty-eight.
the vacant lot.
Yeah, it's a vacant lot because someone stole my house.
so you're saying when you went to work last night, the house was there, and your wife was inside?
Yes.
and now they're both missing.
ye... that is what I'm trying to tell you people! Come on!
so you think somebody was after the house, or the wife?
Oh, that's great!
okay. Is your name Julie Finlay? - Yes.
and were you born in Philadelphia? - Yes.
have you used any illegal drugs, including marijuana, in the last ten years?
no.
do you... - resent having my honesty gauged by debunked pseudo-technology?
Yeah. A little bit.
please keep your answers to a "yes" or "no.
Yes.
do you have any criminal history?
I was married twice.
did my time.
have you ever had sex with an animal?
Oh, my... really?
Yes, or no?
well, my first ex-husband was a bit of a dog.
and my second, a pig.
does that count?
I don't know why you bother.
those people never have a sense of humor, you know that.
I know. I couldn't help myself.
well, I did pass, didn't I?
welcome to Las Vegas.
well, at least it's a better picture than I took in Seattle.
things are looking up.
Yeah. Um, hey, guys?
do me a favor, come in he for a second?
sa Sidle，Morgan Bro, this is Julie Finlay.
Finn, with two N's.
so nice to meet you.
Finn's coming on board.
I ard about your, uh, amazing blood reconstrucon fr Greg.
why don't you guys give her the official tour?
I'd love to, but I'm due back at my crime scene. We have a house to find.
but, uh, it's nice to meet you, Finn.
nice to meet you.
I'll do it. I'll even give you the unofficial tour.
nice.
I like her already.
this damagis recent.
Yeah. Ran the plates.
car belongs to the missing wife Debbie Hicks.
supports the husband's story that the wife was inside the house when the house was stolen.
I mean, if you want to kidnap someone, why take the whole house?
captain, I talked to the neighbors.
a couple of them saw the house driving off last night.
thought the family was moving to another neighborhood.
what the hell?
What'd you do with the house?
what do you mean, me? You stole the house!
I didn't do nothing, okay?
you stashed it away somewhere!
Really? Why would I steal my own house?
because it's not your house, Dwayne.
Hey, calm down, now.
just 'cause you live in the house doesn't make it yours.
possession is 9/10 of the law.
what are you, a lawyer now? - I don't need to go to law school...
what happened to our house?
and you are...
I'm Marla Hicks. I'm Dwayne and Jimmy's sister.
Dwayne and Debbie jacked our house, Marla.
Debbie is missing, dumb-ass. - What?
that is a load of crap. - Oh, is it?
okay, he has always been trying to steal from me. Every since we were kids.
not right now! Jimmy, not right now!
my Hot Wheels, my pot, my Jarts. I loved those Jarts.
the Jarts were for both of us.
it's a two-man game!
a woman is missing, and this fighting is not helping us find her.
you know, that's an excellent point.
so let's take this family feud downtown.
nice. Talk about pot more in front of cops.
why don't you try and steal the police station?
why don't you both shut up?
shut up, Marla.
a family like that kind of makes me glad I'm an only child.
well, maybe if we figure out what happened to the house, we'll figure out what happened to the wife.
no prints.
they didn't even bother to turn the water off. They just sliced right through the pipe.
well, there's four different sets of shoe prints around the house.
is it even possible to move a whole house overnight?
Yeah. Yeah, actually, it is.
and it's not really that hard to do.
just slide two support beams under the joists, jack it up, lower it onto a flatbed... and off you go.
with the wife inside?
Yeah, she had to have been unconscious, or she would've heard something, or felt the house moving, don't you think?
unless she was dead.
could be the perfect crime. No body, no crime scene.
Debbie is a total bitch.
I'm surprised Dwayne's been with her for this long.
they're having marital problems?
hell, yeah.
at each other's throats night and day.
about anything in particular?
money, mostly.
you know, Debbie loves her slots.
she gambled away their savings.
that must have really pissed Dwayne off.
Yeah, I was mad.
we lost our condo.
we had to move back in with my mother.
so the house belongs to your mother. Where is she?
she's dead.
sorry for your loss.
so your mom left you the house?
she would've.
if she had a will.
look, I don't know what my idiot brother told you-- and he is an idiot -
but Debbie swore off gambling, all right?
so we... we are in a good place, right now. Okay?
Oh, really? - Yeah.
because there was a disturbance call at the Tasty Time last week, involving you and your wife.
all right.
Debbie got a little flirty with the fry guy.
and she knows how much I hate that.
it seems you hate a lot of things about your wife Maybe enough to want her dead?
look, if I killed my wife, why would I be the one to report her missing?
maybe to throw suspicion off yourself and onto your "idiot brother"?
well, why don't you find out what he was doing last night?
getting the old rifle cleaned, if you know what I mean.
lucky you. Where?
black Stag.
why make that face?
Where'd you go after? - Home.
alone?
Yeah, alone. Why do you think I had to pay for it?
it says here you work in construction?
off and on.
I don't know if you've noticed, but not a lot of building going on in Vegas these days.
but you have the skills and connections to move a house.
and you said, I quote,"Debbie's a total bitch.
look, I did not steal that house.
and I did not hurt Debbie.
I love that you're all up in my business.
have you even talked to Fred?
who's Fred?
he and my dad had a dry-cleaning business together.
until my dad stole all their money and took off.
when was that? - Ten years ago.
I haven't seen or heard from him since.
tough growing up without a dad.
you didn't know my father.
him leaving was the best thing that ever happened to our family.
he was a real son of a bitch.
your brothers think that Fred stole the house.
Fred? No.
Fred would never do that.
he was there for us the second my dad left, and...
actually, a few years ago, he and my mom got really close and he moved in.
so Fred was living in the house, too.
Yeah. Until my mom died.
and then Dwayne kicked him out.
I'm sure it was Debbie's idea.
what about you? I mean, no will.
the house is just as much yours as it is theirs.
I... I don't want any part of that damn house.
I'm glad it's gone.
you glad Debbie's gone, too?
I didn't like her, but... I never wanted anything bad to happen to her.
I heard you and Finn worked together in Seattle.
Yeah, yeah. Heard right.
rumor has it you fired her.
right again.
so that means there's a good story in there, somewhere.
David! What the hell you got here, buddy?
road kill. Lost an arm and a leg.
I. D?
no I. D.but... check out these tread marks.
about 22 inches, give or take.
this is only sixteen.
so our guy was run over by at least one big-rig and maybe a car or two.
90 degrees. He's been dead around eight hours.
died last night.
not a lot of streetlights.
would've been hard to see in the dark.
Hey, there's a bar back there.
maybe he, uh, hit the hooch and hit the road.
you know, for someone who got run over a couple times, I'm not seeing a lot of blood.
check this out.
blanched skin.
his injuries have an orange tone.
so the blood wasn't circulating.
he was dead before he was run over.
Yeah, this isn't a hit-and-run. This is a dump-and-run.
that's the right address.
as opposed to the other houses that were stolen last night?
any of these guys the Hicks brothers or Fred Blanchard?
no, but any of them could've hired these guys.
or it was just a random house-stealing.
or maybe Debbie Hicks was still gambling, and she owed somebody some money, and they took her and the house as payment.
let's get a closer look at that guy.
where was this taken?
corner of Sunset and Barlow.
but there's no other traffic-cam footage after that.
doesn't mean we can't track it.
you must be Finn.
you must be Stokes. - Yes, ma'am.
anything you need to know about Sin City, I'm your man.
Russell tells me you're quite the insider.
Yeah, how did you you duck the "sex with animals" question on your polygraph?
given your tentacle porn fetish.
Yeah.
Russell told you about that.
what do have you got for us?
well, it looks like our house thieves were pretty sloppy.
I accessed all the 911 calls from last night.
several reports of downed power lines, as well as a dozens of reports of sideswiped cars and other property damage.
looks like "Housezilla" left quite a path of destruction.
follow the destruction, find the house.
Yeah, and maybe Debbie.
house is heading east.
what's over there?
about a hundred miles of desert.
that's a lot of ground to cover.
not if you have eyes in the sky.
I like the way you think.
Jim. Stokes.
we need a chopper.
will you look at this!
you, uh, want to wrap it up, take it back to the lab?
Yeah!
you're still doing that?
if it ain't broke.
hook up the satellite, I want to live here.
it's nice and quiet. No annoying neighbors.
well, maybe one, but he's quiet.
those are guys' legs.
it's definitely not Debbie Hicks.
ruby red shoes.
I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
do you need a hand?
Oh, no, I've got it.
Thanks. - I'm Finn.
David. Welcome aboard.
thank you.
chest is completely concave.
obvious death: crushing injuries.
these shoes match the impressions I found at the Hicks property.
he's definitely one of the house stealers.
has he got an I. D. on him?
I recognize him from the surveillance video.
Finn, do me a favor, and get a picture of that jack under there.
okay.
actually, you know what? I think I got something in the truck we can use to get that out of there.
I got it.
what are you doing? Aw, come on, Jules!
don't call me that!
well, get out from under there, will ya?
unbelievable.
here you go.
you know, I bet I know what happened.
I bet you they were trying to lower the house, this one got jammed,
Mr. Hutchings here tried to fix it.
cause of death: terminal stupidity.
cause of death: karma.
guy steals house, house kills guy.
Hey, fellas, lower it back down, will you?
we should probably get in there.
it's time to figure out what happened to Debbie Hicks.
it's hard to tell if this mess was from a struggle or what.
well, I can tell you that this was...
does not bode well for Debbie.
blood pool's over a liter.
nobody can survive that volume of blood loss.
injuries and death occurred here.
drag marks leading to the kitchen door here.
so whoever killed her dumped her body before they dumped the house.
high-velocity spatter.
if that's from a gunshot, it must have been a revolver.
I don't see any casings laying around.
killer could've picked them up, though, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, one single air bubble.
spatter's not from a shooting. It's expirated blood.
so, Debbie coughed up blood during the attack.
can you tell what kind of weapon he used?
well, we have a castoff pattern, relatively short arc-- one, two, three-- could be from a beating.
maybe Debbie put up a fight when Hutchings came to steal the house.
he could've brought tools, right? Maybe a hammer, a crowbar.
short castoff arcs with no associated medium-force spatter.
indicative of sharp-force trauma.
so you're thinking stabbing.
three castoff events. First stab's always for free.
so, that means she was stabbed at least four times, left here to bleed out.
okay, let's back up a second.
so, just because Dennis Hutchings stole this house, doesn't mean he's our killer, though, right?
no, we got a lot of suspects here, boss.
husband, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, Fred. A whole lot of house to process.
where you planning on sticking that thing?
in your mouth. Open up.
I don't understand. Why you need my DNA?
to prove that you killed my wife.
Mr. Hicks, please step back. I'll be with you in a minute.
you honestly think I killed Debbie?
I want to see you get his DNA good.
I'm gonna need to take yours, too.
Why?
well, we need to eliminate everyone who has legitimate access to your house.
it's not his house. - It is my house.
thanks for saying it.
will you shut up about the house?! Debbie is dead.
it's not your house. - It is my house.
Where's the deed? - You can't even read the deed, so...
Hey, wait. Hang on a second. Don't you need a warrant or something?
only if you refuse to give it voluntarily.
what, are you scared they might find out that you did it?
if you didn't do it, you don't have anything to worry about.
look at his face. His wife is dead.
he can't even fake a few tears.
you totally did it.
get out of my face.
guys! Do you want to spend a night in jail?
be good for you, bro. Get used to it.
I want a lawyer.
I knew it was too good to be true.
you're alive?!
what happened to our house?!
wait a second. Where the hell have you been?!
I was out gambling with my friend.
all night?
well, you lose track of time in the casinos.
we may have had a few mojitos.
okay, five.
all right, well, I'm gonna need the name of your friend, verify your alibi.
alibi for what?
house stealing and murder.
murder?
well, when we found the house, we also found a bloody crime scene.
do you know anything about that?
no. No.
last night, I waited for Dwayne to go to work, and then I hit the Strip.
the house was spotless.
do you know a guy named Dennis Hutchings?
I never heard of him.
I didn't kill anybody.
look, when do I get my house back?
Mrs. Hicks, like I said, your house is a crime scene.
then you should be talking to Dwayne's idiot brother.
if somebody was killed in that house, I bet you 100 bucks he had something to do with it.
well, you know, we thought the blood was yours.
so who does it belong to?
amazing how much damage a big rig can do.
good way to dispose of a body
hopefully, he got a piece of his killer.
well, he definitely got a piece of the murder weapon.
tip of the knife.
non-serrated, single-edged.
so he was stabbed.
Yeah. Based on my analysis, I found...
four penetrating sharp-force injuries.
and you know that how?
uh, Doc Robbins, this is Julie Finlay.
Finn. And this here is Fred Blanchard.
you I. D.'d my victim?
well, technically, he's actually my victim now.
DNA matched Fred here to the large blood pool found at the Hicks' house.
the stolen house in the desert?
this guy was stabbed there?
it doesn't make sense. We found him in the middle of a truck route.
Yeah, I heard. Can I see your report?
Fred Blanchard's body was found right here.
and this is the route that the house took.
I don't think the drag marks in the kitchen were drag marks.
what do you mean?
this is hard to see in the dark wood, but if you look at the bottom of the door, that's blood.
that would not be there if somebody had dragged the body out because the killer would have opened the door.
so they're slide marks.
all right, so if Fred's body's in the house while it's moving, he could've slid out the back door when the house made this right turn, right here.
we know that Fred Blanchard's our victim.
who's our killer?
well, we have Dennis Hutchings, the dead, not so bright house thief.
right. So Fred comes home, catches Dennis in the act.
Dennis kills Fred.
maybe. - Maybe.
Yeah, the Hicks siblings still have the best motive.
all right, Fred is living with the mom. Mom dies.
kids are worried that Fred's gonna take the house from them.
Yeah. Debbie and Dwayne kick him out.
but that's not a permanent enough solution.
Dwayne's alibi's a little shaky.
he said he clocked in to work at 7: 00, but nobody could verify that he spent the whole night there.
Debbie's alibi's even shakier.
she said that she was drinking and gambling all night but can't remember all the casinos she went to after mojito number three.
what?
nothing.
brass just got a lead off Dennis Hutchings' phone records.
so, Marla, how do you know Dennis Hutchings?
I don't, really.
he was just doing a construction job at my school. I'm studying to be a nurse.
but you hired him to steal the house.
he was after me for months to go out with him.
so, finally, I said that I would, if he would do me a favor.
stealing a house; that's a pretty big favor.
I didn't mean for anybody to get hurt, really.
I didn't know that Fred was gonna be there.
I told Dennis to make sure that the house was empty.
and he wasn't gonna let anything or anyone get in the way of his date.
Fred was like a father to me.
I hated the way my family treated him. All because of that stupid house.
okay, well, i-it still doesn't explain why you wanted to steal the house.
I didn't think it through.
I just wanted the fighting to stop.
I mean, my mom's body wasn't even cold before my brothers were arguing over who gets the house.
and how could they even want it after it killed her?
the house killed your mother?
she was... hanging a flower pot on the back porch and it... just collapsed on top of her.
termites.
okay. First your mother, then Fred, then Dennis.
that's one killer house.
you my reinforcements?
Yep. New marching orders.
doc Robbins found the tip of a knife in Fred Blanchard's rib cage.
so Finn was right-- this was a stabbing.
now all we gotta do is find a knife with a missing tip.
Morgan. Found something.
murder weapon? - No, not exactly.
most families keep their skeletons in the closet.
got it? - Yeah.
this house has killed four people now.
the mom, Dennis the home stealer, Fred Blanchard and now this guy.
that makes it a serial killer.
based on the height, shoulder width and clothing, looks like an adult male.
fractured skull; possible blunt-force trauma.
Calliphoridae. Blowflies.
they arrive within minutes of death, which means this guy decomposed in the wall.
what are the odds the family didn't know there was a rotting corpse in their wall?
well, given the dehydration and the condition of the body, this guy's been dead at least ten years.
Hicks brothers would've been teenagers.
old enough to commit murder.
according to Marla Hicks, the dad, Walter, walked out on the family ten years ago.
you think this is Walter Hicks?
look, everybody says he was a mean son of a bitch.
his wife, his kids, his ex-business partner, Fred, they all hated him.
they all had motive.
maybe he never left.
there's some papers in here.
well, they've been exposed to adipocere during decomp.
they were holed up in the wall with the body.
could be significant.
Yeah. Maybe QD can help restore them.
first things first-- let's get our mummy back to the morgue.
okay. Let's run it.
well, based on the tool marks on the mummy's skull, the killer's weapon of choice was a hammer.
we did find traces on the mummy's clothing, of sarsaponin.
it's from the yucca plant. It's sold commercially to eliminate strong odors.
the main distributor's a company called Stink Away.
so the killer must have doused him with it, tried to cover up the stench of decomp.
so it is possible that the family didn't notice the rotting corpse in the wall.
DNA results. Our mummy is a daddy.
Really?
so it's Walter Hicks?
uh, maybe, maybe not. Here's where it gets really interesting.
I compared his DNA to all three of the Hicks siblings.
it turns out our mummy is the biological daddy of Marla but not Dwayne and Jimmy.
well... looks like Lois Hicks stepped out on her husband.
okay. We still don't know who the mummy is or who killed him.
and we still don't know who killed Fred.
actually, I may have a lead on that.
Epthelials under Fred's nails belonged to one of the Hicks brothers.
Fred attacked me. Look, that's how I got these.
that's why you're reluctant to give us your DNA.
you were afraid we were gonna connect you to Fred.
like I told you, he attacked me.
I'd like to believe you, Dwayne.
I really would.
but Fred is dead.
and more than likely you got those scratches because he was struggling for his life.
I didn't kill Fred.
come on, Dwayne, you kicked him out of his own house.
Hey, that is not his house!
when Mom died, he should've left on his own. So... so what?
I gave him a little push.
Dwayne, stop it! You can't do this.
Yeah, I can. Here, Fred, take your stuff and get out.
if your mother were here, she'd be so ashamed of you all.
Yeah, well, she's not here-- she's dead. Time for you to go.
you cannot just kick Fred out! This is his house, too.
shut up, Marla!
this is our family home, and he is not part of our family!
Oh, man.
you kicked him out of the house in the morning.
he came back at night, right?
maybe to get his things?
and that's when you killed him.
Hey, that's a great story. That's your story; I'm sticking with my story.
and if you don't believe me, you can ask Debbie, you can ask Marla, ask them both.
no prints in the house belonging to anyone outside of the family, and no sign of the murder weapon.
Nick and I searched every inch of that house.
okay, so blood spatter tells us that Fred was killed in the kitchen.
tip of the knife broke off in his chest.
maybe the killer... took the knife with him.
Oh, wait a minute... maybe the knife was still in his chest when he slid out of the house.
and broke off when he got run over.
which means the knife would still be out on that road.
okay, expand the search area.
and you can take boyfriend Greg with you.
part of the blade. Blood on it.
if we can find the other piece of the handle, maybe we can get some DNA, prints.
well, I found one piece.
this is gonna take a while.
ridge detail.
you any good at jigsaw puzzles?
my dad gave me one for my eighth birthday.
empire State Building, thousand pieces. Did it in six hours.
by myself.
let's see if we can break your record.
got a partial.
we've gotten AFIS hits off of less.
I hear you're gonna blow my mind.
blood on the knife is a match to our vic, Fred Blanchard.
which means it's definitely the murder weapon.
not exactly blowing my mind.
Oh, we're getting there.
we recovered a partial print off of the handle of the knife.
it didn't match Dwayne Hicks.
so, we have three other Hicks, right? Debbie, Jimmy, and Marla.
none of the above. - Really?
but we did get a hit in AFIS.
prints came back to a long-lost member of the Hicks family.
dear old not-so-dead Dad.
my mind is blown.
he was in the system for assaulting a guy in a bar fight 15 years ago.
so now we know the mummy in the wall isn't Walter.
so who is he?
Walter Hicks is alive and well.
came back to town... killed Fred.
did he kill the mummy, too?
we still have no idea who that is.
well, at least we know that mummy is Marla Hicks' father.
if Walter found out about it, that is motive.
Yeah. Yeah, and-and I sent the papers walled up with the mummy to QD.
if I can restore them, I bet they'll help us figure out who the guy is.
so you're saying that Walter isn't my real dad?
that's what I'm saying, yeah.
your biological father's name was Tony Perrella. He was a-a handyman.
did some work around your house.
my mother had sex with some handyman?
I think it was a lot more than that.
I think she and Tony were the real deal. I found some letters that he wrote to her.
you, uh, you want to take a look?
thank you.
I never believed in soul mates until I met you.
when you told me you loved me,"I felt like the luckiest man in the world.
I can't wait to start our life together.
sounds to me like she really loved him.
I think she was even going to leave Walter for him.
Yeah, and the little we know of Walter, that was a very good decision.
Tony was reported missing on March 20, 1991.
I was born in November.
so my mother probably didn't even know that she was pregnant when he was murdered.
she probably thought Tony left her because he was tired of waiting on her to leave Walter, you know what I mean?
Yeah, it must have been hard on her. Losing somebody that she loved that much.
my mother always had this sadness about her.
now I know why.
you know, it's funny.
when we were looking for you, we couldn't find any record of a Walter Hicks since 2002.
but then we ran your full name, Walter Douglas Hicks, and wouldn't you know it, there's a Walter Douglas living in New Mexico.
who just happened to use his credit card here in Vegas two days ago.
so it's been ten years, Walter. What brings you back to the city?
gambling? Nightlife?
or... maybe this. CSI found it in your old house.
I haven't lived there in ten years.
Tony Perrella's been dead for 20. - Who?
your handyman.
we have some invoices here that said Tony spent a lot of time at your house.
doing repairs. Your wife.
we also found love letters that Tony wrote to your wife.
I'm pretty sure you found them too, right?
and that's why you killed him.
love letters? That's all you got?
no, actually, we have a lot more. We have some, uh, some receipts.
for some, uh, 2x4s, spackling, drywall, from a local hardware store.
right around the time that Tony was reported missing.
Yeah, don't forget that large bottle of Stink Away.
stink Away. Right here.
Ravenson Hardware keeps impeccable records.
you remember Tony now?
Lois took the boys to her mother for the week.
I... got Tony to come to the house.
you think you can screw my wife?
I love Lois. You don't give a damn about her.
you stay the hell away from her.
he said he wanted to fight for her.
he lost.
you got away with murder. Too bad Lois died, right?
probably got a little worried, maybe someone'd buy the house and find the body.
so you came back to move it.
and guess who shows up?
the old business partner Fred.
what the hell are you doing here?
heard about Lois.
wh? And you came to pay your respects?
you never cared about her when she was alive. Why start now?
we know what happens when you lose your temper.
somebody ends up dead.
Fred threatened to call the cops about a financial dispute we had ten years ago.
financial dispute? Oh, you mean that's when you stole all the money out of your business account, and left Fred with nothing?
I didn't want to go to jail.
take your hands off of me.
you come back to move the mummy out of the wall, but leave a fresh body in the kitchen?
I heard this big truck pull up outside. And I had to get out of there in a hurry.
Yeah, that would be the house stealers.
it's... long story. You know, you're a very mean, angry man, Mr. Hicks.
and anger's like a toxin.
it poisons everything it touches, especially your family and also that house of yours.
prison is full of mean and angry people, Walter.
so you'll fit right in.
you are not seriously doing this! I'm going after him.
Yeah, that's gonna help.
do not do this. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, great, look at this.
Jimmy? Seriously?
you're so dumb.
thank you for coming. I didn't know who else to call.
you cannot change the locks on this house! It's not your house, dumb-ass!
like you said, bro, possessing is nine-tenths of the law.
it's possession, you idiot. - Thank you.
Hey, arrest him, he's squatting. Hell, shoot him.
no, no, no... No one is shooting anyone.
it is just a house. It's not worth killing each other.
shut up, Marla. You're not even our real sister anymore.
Yeah, you're barely family, okay?
we have the same mother, you idiots.
Hey, are you guys gonna do anything? Do something. What are you doing?
we're gonna do something.
good.
you are so dumb. Why are yoill doing that?
get off my lawn.
this is not your lawn. It's the desert.
get off my desert.
you each want a piece of the house?
great. Let's divvy it up.
what do you want? You want the living room and the dining room?
yeah? - No!
would you like the bedroom and the bathroom maybe?
I'm just gonna chop it right in half.
you can't chop up our house.
okay. Is that good?
or, you know, there's another way to settle this.
this house caused a lot of damage on the way up here. Over $100, 000.
whoever owns the house gets the bill.
wait... the house isn't even worth that much.
she stole it.
Yeah, give her the bill.
What?! I never even wanted this house.
and then we told Marla that she could donate the house to a charity or the city, so she doesn't have to pay the bill.
smart.
it was actually Sara's idea.
probably didn't hurt to have some crazy lady running around with a chainsaw.
you heard? - Yeah, I heard.
a little too familiar.
I don't get it.
what's that?
well, I've been walking around this place the last couple days, trying to find the problem.
this place is like a family. You've got the best of the best.
that's true.
so why... why'd you bring me here?
best of the best can always get better. Right?
you know that's only half an answer.
Jules, let's not do this.
I just don't want history to repeat itself.
well, that makes two of us.
you need anything else, hon?
no. Thank you.
here you go, Miss Connie.
Oh, thank you. - You're welcome.
Edie, did I show you these yet?
look how precious.
I can't believe how big those grandbabies are getting.
I know.
Hey, guys. Whenever you're ready, okay?
Thanks.
Sheila, it's 4: 00 in the morning.
do we really have to fight about this now?
looking good. - Not for you, young lady.
strawberries.
I don't know what your secret is, but one of these days, you're gonna have to share it with my brother.
Hey, why do we keep having the same conversation?
it's not going to change anything.
but it's not up to you. This time it's up to me.
I don't know how you keep that figure drinking one of these every night.
work it off on stage, honey. Trust me.
you should come see the show sometime.
Yeah.
I thought you were off at 4: 00.
I'm-I'm staying a while longer.
is that guy still bothering you?
can't you two make him disappear?
Hey, I'll tell you what, we'll have a little talk with him on the way out.
Thanks.
looks like your problem disappeared, Edie.
3-David-11, respond to 308...
Bye, guys.
all right, see you, fellas.
I got to get more hash browns.
okay.
Hey, you know what I'm talking about, though. I'm talking about the dish with the tortillas and the...
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I can't believe we've been coming here for the past 12 years and you've never had the chilaquiles.
I don't like chilaquiles.
Seriously? Have you had Vincent's? - No.
Sara. Help me out here.
you know, I'm not a fan either.
Really?
Vincent call you guys, too?
no, we're just coming here to grab something to eat. Why?
not sure. Vincent said he's stuck in the fridge.
can't get his brother to answer his cell.
maybe he's enjoying some "chilly-killies."
no, no, its "cheelay-keelays."
Oh, my God.
control, 3-David-10.
multiple 419s at Frank's Diner.
Owen's dead.
Yeah, so is Dahlia.
it's Edie. - We just left her.
she's dead, too.
let's take the back. Come on, let's go.
clear.
clear.
freezer.
j-just me, guys.
Hey, Vincent, let's go out back.
Why? Wh-What's happening?
let's just go out back. Go in there.
come on, come on.
Vincent, stop, Vincent, no.
no.
come on, man. There's blood on the floor here.
this can't be! I just...
they're all dead.
what the hell happened? You were here?
we'd just left.
captain, it was only a couple minutes.
register's cleaned out. It looks like a robbery, maybe.
maybe?
Edie was having trouble with some guy, a stalker. He was hanging around out front.
well, did you do anything about it?
wish we had. We were gonna go talk to him, but he was gone before we even got outside.
we know this guy, right? - Yeah.
so put a broadcast out! Get him here!
Yes, sir.
Oh, man.
you know, I-I been coming here probably 20 years.
even had Thanksgiving dinner here when I first came to Vegas.
shooter must've come in the front door.
I mean, the trouble started right there with Owen.
and you know Dahlia always sits at the counter.
must've tried to jump in.
once a marine, always a marine.
I always used to notice them when they came in here.
the way they looked at each other.
they seemed so... content.
seemed to have marriage all figured out.
look at that.
I know most of the faces in here. Ever see these two guys before?
no, I haven't.
but Connie was always happy to see a fresh face so she could show off her grandkids.
all this carnage, you know.
I don't buy robbery.
akers is putting a broadcast out on the stalker.
been terrorizing Edie for six months.
wasn't enough to kill her.
he wanted to destroy her whole world.
gunshot to the head, up close and personal.
I tried to help her get a restraining order, but the judge denied it.
Basderic has been very careful.
he'd push right up to the line and never cross it.
until now.
shoe impression.
they don't match any of the shoes in here.
I got to take this.
Yeah, go ahead.
you step on my finger, I'll kill you.
ten inches in front of your left foot.
could you mark it?
Thanks.
Hey, guys, could I just have an hour to be alone so I can work the blood?
I was just going to check the walk-in.
is there blood?
no.
okay.
Hello?
Hey, Finn. I found something.
well, I'd... I'd love to, but, uh... you're gonna have to come to me.
it's okay, Charlie, I'll take care of him.
how could this happen?
I don't know yet, man. We're just getting started.
now, do you have any other clothes?
cause the minute you stepped in blood, you became evidence, you know that, right?
no, I-I understand. How many times have I heard you guys talk about crime scenes?
no, no, that's okay, I'll get it.
I'll get it. Just relax.
okay, turn around for me.
Oh, God. That's Sheila, Owen's wife.
Vincent, they called me, but they're wrong. It's not true, right?
he's okay! Please! Tell me he's okay!
I'm so sorry.
No! - Sheila.
no, no, Vincent. Now, get back. I can't let you do that.
not until I've processed your clothes, okay?
what's all the fuss? You look okay to me.
and here I thought you weren't gonna come visit me.
you got in just under the wire, mister.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
no, that's...
Barbara and I had to take Maya and Katie back up to Seattle.
I took a little time off.
how you feeling?
you know...
honestly, it hurts.
I wouldn't recommend getting shot.
although it did get my daughter to tell me she loves me, so...
can't be bad.
Yeah.
how is your family?
better. Thank you.
Barbara's gonna stay there for a while. Help them get settled in.
damn it.
there it is.
Thanks.
good, you're dressed. We got to go.
honey, look, if you don't have the time...
no, I-I want to take you home. I just can't stick around.
got a call. All hands on deck.
that's the diner?
Finn told me that she had that handled.
well, I got "all hands."
all right. I better take off.
I'm happy to see you. - Really, thanks for stopping by.
see you there.
you're not supposed to be working, remember?
no, you're right.
I'm gonna get a nurse. Get you out of here.
Yeah, it's Ecklie. Get me the sheriff.
you know, I appreciate you having my back, but I think you might have misrepresented the situation just a little bit.
Yeah, in what way?
pretty sure that I said that it was something that I could handle.
I think your exact words were, "It's nothing to worry about."
Oh, and are you worried?
Yeah, a little bit.
you look stumped.
I'm not stumped. I'm thinking.
I've released the other bodies, but there's something odd about these three.
I'm going with stumped.
thinking.
look at the blood on this guy's chin.
unless gravity's been altered, it's going the wrong way.
Yeah, you're right.
this guy's lying down now, but he had to be upright when he was shot.
and over here, on this guy...
there's no exit wound, and yet, his back is all bloody.
which means he was laying down, not sitting.
Where's her wound?
on the right.
how was she shot on the right while she was sitting here?
she wasn't.
someone moved all three of these bodies after they were shot.
they had a camera in the walk-in?
Yeah, Vincent said someone was pilfering steak and lobster a while back.
how long was Vincent in there?
well, the camera's motion-activated, and there's no time code, so I checked cell records from the first time he dialed his brother until the cops let him out.
under seven minutes.
you buy he got locked in there?
it happens easier than you'd think.
not interrupting. I just, uh... I wanted to find out about, uh, your father.
uh, he's getting out of the hospital today, and I wanted to see how that all went.
it was... fine. Thank you for asking, though.
Yeah, it's, uh, no trouble at all.
uh, to ask, I mean. Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm gonna go.
did he seem weird to you? I mean, weirder than usual.
no, not at all.
I got three more in the hallway.
well, I can always use the overtime.
why don't you, uh, prep this young lady? I'm almost done with Dalia.
Yeah.
can I help you?
I'm looking for a loved one who was brought in.
reception let you come back here?
I might have given them the impression I worked for the mortuary.
so, you're the next of kin?
I'm the closest thing Edie's got. We were gonna be married.
I see, Mr...
David, call Sara.
tell her to bring down Edie's paperwork right away for Mr. Basderic.
right.
we met at the diner where she worked. I went in there a lot.
she was always so good to me. So warm.
I just knew.
and I could see in her eyes... she felt it, too.
I'm sorry for your loss.
right there.
I can't allow you to touch her.
I'd like to put the ring on her finger.
no, I'm sorry.
that's him. That's Basderic.
Hello, Ron.
it's a match.
you're done, you son of a bitch.
where are my clothes? I want my clothes.
that prison jumpsuit is the only clothes you need to worry about now.
when you return them, I expect them to be in the condition in which you received them.
I'm very particular.
we have you in the diner, Ronald. You stepped in Edie's blood.
I went in to check on her.
cops saw you stalking her from outside right before the shooting.
I wasn't stalking; I was observing.
you were there.
Yes. But I knew the officers would harass me, so I took a walk around the block.
when I got back, I could tell something was wrong.
that's when I went inside.
she was already dead.
why didn't you call 911?
because she was already dead.
okay, you didn't do it, so you must have seen who did.
I told you, I went for a walk around the block.
if I knew who killed Edie, I would tell you.
they took her from me.
she was mine.
do you own a gun, Ronald?
I would never. I hate guns.
open your mouth.
no. You can't make me. Not without my consent.
I can get a court order.
good luck with that.
I can't imagine too many judges being receptive to your requests.
what with your corruption scandal and all.
three bodies all moved after the fact.
why were they moved, and who moved them?
do we know who they are?
Yeah, this is Connie. She was a regular at the diner.
a bus driver who drove the 5: 00 a. m. shift so that she could be at home with her grandkids in the afternoon.
their mom's a blackjack dealer.
this one I don't know. Who is this, Super Dave?
Oh, I found an Arizona driver's license.
I ran him through mobile AFIS. There's no criminal history.
and this guy, Alex Brenner. Local address.
look at that, brand-new license. Mint condition.
I'm running his prints now.
access blocked.
I have a feeling our friend Alex Brenner here isn't Alex Brenner.
sheriff, I'm aware of the pressure that you're getting from the press on this case.
no, I know, I get it, I get it. No, I don't disagree.
no, especially in light of what's going on in the department.
but I have a feeling that the answer you're looking for is staring at me right now in my office.
I'll get back to you.
captain. Karen Taylor, Deputy U. S. Marshal.
your department ran fingerprints on someone we have an interest in.
let me guess: Alex Brenner.
that's what you Feds are calling him, right?
and since it's U. S. Marshals in my office and not FBI, I'm guessing he was in Witness Protection.
so, who is he really? - Obviously, I can't tell you that.
who are you protecting him from? - I can't tell you that, either.
miss Taylor, you dropped this guy in my jurisdiction without even bothering to call the department.
now he's one of eight victims in a multiple homicide that just so happened to have killed several of my friends.
now, you got about two seconds to tell me something or I'll have you thrown out of here.
Alex Brenner testified against some really bad people about four months ago.
we dropped him in Las Vegas just last week.
as for our failure to notify LVPD, frankly, we didn't know if you could be trusted.
okay. So, these "bad people" are they the kind that would sacrifice seven innocent lives just to get the one they want?
I believe so. Yes.
pretty intense look you have going on there.
what are you searching for?
Edie's stalker, Basderic. He knows the law.
up until last night, he has known exactly how far he could go without crossing the line.
but the guy is sick. Edie couldn't have been his first.
he-he must've screwed up somewhere before.
I just haven't been able to find it.
well, have you tried searching court records for other TROs or denied apps?
Yeah, I did that. I'm on criminal records now.
OK, well, how about I take civil court.
Basderic's not a common name. Well, you never know.
Oh, here's something. Apparently, Basderic was involved in a lawsuit.
who sued him?
actually, he was the plaintiff.
he sued for damages after some guy assaulted him.
well, what do you want to bet that the guy was the boyfriend or the husband of some poor woman that Basderic was stalking?
well, the judge sided with Basderic and awarded him almost $200, 000.
I hate this guy.
I hate the way he works the law.
well, this probably won't ease your blood pressure any, but during the assault, Basderic actually shot the guy.
he shot his attacker?
legally, it was self-defense.
point is... he had a gun.
Hey, Doc.
we need to take a long, hard look at Alex Brenner.
you care to elaborate?
well, he was in the Witness Protection Program.
we're thinking maybe that's what got him killed.
along with everybody else in the diner.
what can you tell us about where he's been?
well, there are some things that suggest his history. Dental work, certainly.
I don't think it was done in the U. S. Mexico, maybe.
what else?
he was suffering from talcosis. I found talc granulomas in his lungs.
talc?
Yeah, it's a condition usually associated with drug use.
people inject talc-diluted heroin or cocaine.
but there's no evidence that he was a drug user.
so how did the talc get into his body?
probably inhaled.
I'm thinking that he spent a lot of time in an environment where talc was used, breathed it in.
Yeah, drug environment. If he was cutting heroin and cocaine with talc.
it's mot an unreasonable inference.
stomach content was waffles.
is that significant?
if he ate waffles, that puts him in the corner booth where we found Rios.
what did Rios eat?
his stomach was filled with pizza.
Frank's Diner doesn't serve pizza.
maybe he wasn't there to eat.
okay, what more can you tell us about Rios?
I found fibers in his upper trachea and esophagus as well as his mouth.
I gave them to Hodges, but he hasn't tested them yet.
until a minute ago, Mr. Rios here was on the back burner.
he's on the front burner now.
the pizza would have raised a red flag had I known that the diner didn't serve pizza, but I didn't know that the diner didn't serve pizza.
you care to guess why?
because no one ever includes me whenever they go to the diner.
positive for lead.
what about the fiber?
it's a microfiber.
polyethylene terephthalate to be more precise.
more commonly known as polar fleece.
like a jacket.
or, considering that he inhaled it, I think Rios was wearing a ski mask.
the belt tested positive for lead. Tells me he had a gun.
and a mask.
robert Rios was not a victim.
he was the shooter.
robert Rios had an Arizona license.
PD's there checking into him now.
I guess the bigger question is, if Rios is our shooter, who shot Rios?
probably whoever hired him.
could be the cartel if they were after Alex Brenner.
you know, once the dirty work's done, you bring somebody in; a cleaner.
kill Rios, take his gun, move the bodies.
okay, you know what? Let's not wait for the cops in Arizona.
dig into Rios. Get whatever you can, okay?
all right, I'm on it.
all right, I'm here. What's the issue?
I ran ballistics on all 15 rounds that were fired.
turns out five of them were from a second gun.
well, that's consistent with the idea of a cleaner, right?
we know at least two of the shots were the ones that killed Rios.
and we've got the point-blank on the waitress, Edie.
then I've got two misses.
misses?
wouldn't have thought a cleaner would be sloppy.
that's not all.
check this out.
the red laser is a miss from Rios's gun.
the green is the cleaner's.
two different guns, both fired from the same place.
doesn't make any sense. - Yeah.
is that can where it was when you found it?
no, it was on the floor. I replaced it.
but there was oil residue on the counter, so I knew where to put it.
let me try something here. Excuse me a sec.
square peg in a square hole.
shots came from there.
Alex Brenner had the second gun.
it fits with everything we know about him. He was in Witness Protection.
he was fearing for his life, so he was carrying.
call Finn. Get her down here. I want to run this thing.
okay, I'm Rios. I'm the shooter. Where do we start?
okay, first event happens here. Owen and the shooter struggle, and fight for control of the gun.
the gun discharges, severing Owen's finger.
okay, and then at some point during the struggle, Dahlia gets up off of her stool, and comes over and tries to help.
first shot misses, hits the chocolate milk shake, and the next two take Dahlia down.
now, I just shot two people pretty quickly.
if I'm robbing the place, why don't I just turn around and leave? Why do I keep killing?
well, we know that you were wearing a mask. Maybe it came off during the struggle.
so I'm eliminating witnesses.
or you haven't hit your target yet.
so the waitress is next?
shot goes through the coffee pot, and then into her chest.
well, given that Edie crawled, that actually comes later.
the old couple comes next.
they are sitting targets, literally.
he tries to shield her, he gets the first shot, and she gets the second.
that leaves just two more targets: Alex and the bus driver Connie.
Yeah, she goes first, running towards the restrooms, probably trying to escape.
shot catches her in the side, just below her armpit.
that leaves Alex, and he just saw me shoot six people.
and we now know he has a gun.
and he knows that I'm coming for him.
so he tries to defend himself.
both shots miss and hit the olive oil can.
and I put two into him.
as far as Rios goes, that's the end of the shooting.
time for the cleaner.
say that's me.
Vincent said that they kept the back door open to let air in, so I could have come from back here.
and I, Rios, know you, so I don't shoot.
but I do something that you are definitely not expecting.
I pick up Alex's gun, and I shoot you.
so Edie crawls out from behind the counter.
I realize she's alive.
she's just seen me shoot Rios.
I go up to her and... final shot.
so the theory is Alex was the target.
wait a minute. It still doesn't explain Edie's stalker, Basderic.
we know he was here. He left shoe impressions right there.
so are you thinking that Basderic put the kill shot into Edie?
he felt rebuffed by her. We know he's gone off before.
he lied about never having had a gun.
hold on a sec.
Hey, Nick.
Yeah, just got access to Robert Rios's banking records.
somebody we know has been writing him some big checks.
who?
his ex-girlfriend.
you know, Mrs. DeMarcus, this must be a complicated time.
I mean, who do you mourn? Your dead husband or the other guy you were involved with?
there was nothing going on between me and Robert. Well, not anymore.
so you didn't pay him to kill your husband?
why would you think that?
you gave him $6, 000 last month.
$5, 000 the month before. $10, 000 the month before that.
I help Robert out. I have for a long time.
he had a gambling problem.
he owed people money. I didn't want to see him hurt.
why on earth would I want Owen dead?
I don't know. Maybe your marriage was in trouble.
our marriage wasn't in trouble.
Owen and I were fine.
Owen didn't love the fact that she kept bailing out Rios, but it was her money.
that's what you get for marrying a rich girl.
did you ever hear them fight about it?
sure, but they fought all the time. That was part of the attraction.
that kind of passion can turn bad. Believe me, I've seen it happen.
not them. I-I-I'm telling you, things were going well.
even the money thing.
what do you mean by that?
Owen and I were working a deal with the Mediterranean.
they want to put a Frank's Diner in the casino.
Owen was about to have plenty of money of his own.
both of us.
trust me, Nick.
there's no way Sheila is the one who's behind what happened.
all units, possible 413, shots fired. Corner of Dermott and Westfall.
that's the diner.
what's going on? - Uh, not sure. Shots fired at the diner.
no, stay here, Vincent. We'll handle it.
coming through. Coming through. What's up?
Nick, relax, man.
what's up? - Code four.
accidental discharge. Newspaper guy.
what's he doing out of bed?
Hey, Ecklie. Didn't you get shot?
come on, man, you know the drill. You got to give yourself some time to heal here.
thanks for the advice, Nick.
here's the gun.
Nine-millimeter? That's the same caliber as the diner.
Yep. Guy was refilling the newspaper machines.
he took the day-old papers out, was stacking them in his truck for recycling when the gun fell out.
he picked it up. It discharged.
Where's the second one?
we know there were two guns.
here we go.
this one's a little bit thicker than the others.
there she is. The second gun.
both of these guns have been wiped clean.
same with the shells. There's nothing on them.
but the ninhydrins brought up some useful prints on the paper.
it sounds to me like after the shooting, our guy leaves the diner looking to dump the guns somewhere and sees the newspaper machine.
for a buck in quarters, he's found a pretty good place to hide them.
it's already Monday-- it's unlikely that anybody's going to buy the Sunday paper, so the guns stay put until the delivery guy hauls them away.
we got a match.
how'd you meet Rios?
gamblers Anonymous?
some twisted chat room?
I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know any Rios.
listen, Ronald, we're just trying to give you a chance to explain yourself.
your fingerprints are on the paper. The gun was inside.
your footprints are in the diner. You are never going to see the light of day again.
don't touch the evidence.
can you just fix that?
that newspaper machine is on public property.
I can legally be there.
I can watch Edie from there.
you know how, when you make a sandwich, you don't like to use the heel?
right, so when you open up the package of bread, what do you do?
I, uh... well, I move the heel out of the way, reach past it and I grab a slice from the middle of the loaf.
Yeah, me, too.
what's your point?
the point is, it's the same thing with a newspaper machine.
you don't take the top copy, right, that has a fold in it?
you lift it up, and you take the one underneath.
especially if you're as OCD as this guy is.
so he lifts it up and takes a clean copy from the middle.
he bought a paper the day before-- this one was on top-- and that's how his prints got on it?
you think Basderic's prints were already there when the cleaner hid the guns there?
find anything?
do you have any idea how many people touch this thing on a given day, week, month?
you check the inside?
door won't open.
you need a quarter?
Oh, that's funny.
but the coin slot's jammed.
my guess: it's not by accident.
whoever stashed those guns probably didn't want anyone to find them.
what is it?
it's a foreign coin. Chinese.
is that bad?
Nick, you know me.
I thought I did.
till I found that.
you keep a bowl below the register for all the foreign coins that end up at the diner.
you showed it to me once, remember?
come on, it's a coin. So what?
so I don't miss details, Vincent.
why don't you take a look at a couple of photos?
that's the apron you had on when you went into the fridge.
and that's the one you had on when we let you out.
take a look at the strands.
this one's white, and this one's blue.
you switched the aprons.
Wh-What? Why would I do that?
to hide the evidence.
it's the same reason you moved the bodies and dumped the mop bucket.
here's the apron you started with.
I had to tear the back room apart, but I found it.
you've been working in that restaurant since you were ten years old.
I've never even known you to take a vacation. I mean, I've seen the car that you drive.
you've sacrificed everything to keep that family business going.
but your brother-- he's a different story, isn't he?
he married a rich girl, he buys nice things, he travels.
and then, finally, one day, your ship comes in.
the Mediterranean wants to put a Frank's Diner in the casino.
that's got to be a big payday, Vincent.
how much was that worth? - I don't know.
sure, you do. You know exactly how much.
but your brother, he vetoed it. Didn't he?
he said no.
that was my payoff.
my reward for 40 years of giving everything.
and he said no, just like that.
and now eight people are dead.
I never wanted that to happen.
Rios was supposed to do a fake robbery.
I knew Owen would fight back.
Rios was just supposed to shoot him and get out. That's it.
what the hell did you do? What'd you do?!
he pulled off my mask. They saw my face. I had no choice.
and at that point, you knew there was no turning back, so you shot him.
you were afraid that we'd eventually connect Rios back to you, so you tried to make him look like a customer.
and moved the bodies.
the apron.
the mop bucket.
like you said, I... I learned a few things.
not enough.
Nick, please.
don't look at me like that.
I was just desperate.
just pushed too far.
I'm not a monster.
no? What about Edie?
she was still alive, wasn't she?
and she witnessed everything that you did.
so you put a gun to her head...
and you pulled the trigger.
you see? You were wrong about me.
I didn't hurt her.
I couldn't. I loved her.
you loved her? Are you kidding me?
you terrorized her.
you kept her awake at night. You made her afraid to walk down the street.
and you want to know what else your twisted love did? It killed her, Ronald.
Edie was supposed to be off work at 4: 00.
she should have been gone when the shooting happened, but she was afraid to walk home because she was afraid that you were out there.
it's because of you that she stayed, and now she's dead.
I know, Barbara. I-I know that.
but this is our home now. I'm here. Charlie's here.
uh, sweetheart, I'm going to have to call you back, all right?
I got to go. I love you.
is Barbara okay?
Yeah.
when's she coming back?
uh, she's going to stay up in Seattle for a little while longer.
Maya needs her.
do you need me to stay for anything?
no. Go home.
thank you.
and good work on this one.
Thanks.
shut your mouth and act like you got some sense, girl!
are you sure you have the right address?
it's 1027 Washington Street.
I don't even see any numbers.
well, it's got to be just... up there.
you better shut your mouth!
that guy has a gun.
it's... probably just part of his costume.
yo. Cheerleader. Yeah, you.
okay. Forget the party. Let's get a cab and go home.
want to party with us?
what is that?
what's going on?
well, the dog's freaking out. Won't let us near the body.
it's like he's... guarding his kill.
who called it in?
tinker Bell and the cheerleader. They got lost on the way to a party.
at first, they thought the body was a fake.
happy Halloween.
looks like the dog went for his throat.
Yeah. Animal instinct.
well, his throat is completely ripped open. Must've bled out.
any I. D.?
Yeah. Smith & Wesson.
okay, well...
gun hasn't been fired.
and a wallet.
he's a cop.
k-9 Unit, Officer Mike Nelson.
so you think that's his dog?
so much for man's best friend.
found something else.
want to give me some light there?
Oh, man.
well, it looks like methamphetamines, Jim.
so, we got a cop out of uniform in a skanky part of town with a bag of ice.
something stinks here and I don't think it's the dog.
CSI Russell, Sergeant Varanski, chief trainer with the K-9 unit.
sorry about Officer Nelson.
is that dog always that aggressive?
Sam? No.
he and Mike were partners for eight years. Best team in the department.
officer Nelson was out of uniform. Was he working undercover?
no. He was off duty last night.
if he was off duty, what was he doing in the Alphabets with a bag full of meth?
Mike was a good cop. - They both were.
these dogs are trained to attack, am I right?
they only bite to hold a suspect or to defend themselves.
we're talking about more than just a bite here, Sergeant.
Nelson's throat was ripped open.
can you think of anything that would set that dog off?
he could be sick. That would make any dog lash out.
and he could've gotten into Nelson's stash. I mean, look at him.
I'll take him into custody, get him checked out by the vet.
no, no. No, we have to process him first.
he's got evidence all over him.
Yeah, when we're done I'll make sure he gets to you, okay?
thank you very much. Appreciate that.
brass found Nelson's truck about a block from the crime scene. Had it towed in.
find anything? - Yeah.
a piece of the dog's nail, and some dried blood on the window.
dog clawed his way out.
so, if Nelson was off duty, buying drugs, why bring the dog?
sergeant told me that the dog lived with Nelson. Went everywhere with him.
so... for protection?
well, if that's the case, why would you leave the dog in the truck?
maybe that's what he was trying to protect.
in a neighborhood like that, you leave your truck, you never know if it's gonna be there when you get back, especially on Halloween.
Department-issued envelope... full of cash.
must be at least five grand here.
could've been stolen from Evidence.
could be this dog wasn't just going after his partner, he was going after a dirty cop.
meet Barry Sloan.
big-shot lawyer. Lived alone.
but I bet he wasn't lonely.
this place reeks of money.
professionally decorated, impeccably clean... all to impress the ladies.
Yeah, I've spent some time in bedrooms like this.
thought you were into cops.
I do marry cops, but... I've dated some lawyers.
they're fun to argue with.
boy, they can be sleazy sometimes, though.
apparently, you're not the only one who thinks so.
police responded to a 911 call, shots fired.
when they got here, the shower was still running, but Mr. Sloan is bone-dry.
GSW to the chest.
blood is confined to this area, which means he must've been on the bed or nearby when he was shot.
shooter missed at least once.
found a bullet hole in the wall there.
based on the trajectory, looks like it came from that direction.
radial cracks indicate that the force must've originated from the outside.
means our shooter was on the outside of the window.
who called it in?
Mrs. Young?
ms. Ms. I got tired of being a housewife.
dumped the husband, kept the last name. And his Jag.
Oh, lucky you. I had to pay mine alimony.
so, what exactly did you hear?
well, I get up early every morning to do my meditation.
I had just reached an elevated state of consciousness when I heard: bang, bang!
so two gunshots in all. - Yeah.
and what time was that? - I looked at the clock. It was 6: 05.
and did you see anything? Anyone?
nothing. But then I had this really bad feeling it had something to do with Barry.
why do you think it had something to do with Barry?
a lot of people hated him. He was a real shark. Divorce lawyer.
I've known quite a few of those.
one time a brick came flying through my window with a note attached.
it said, "Burn in hell, you scumbag lawyer."
meant for Barry but... they got my house by mistake.
so, I guess Mr. Sloan was not very popular in the neighborhood.
listen, I feel bad about what happened to Barry, but... you ask me, our property values just went up.
that's a horrible thing to say. The poor man just died.
and how exactly do you know Mr. Sloan?
Oh, um, we've been neighbors for 13 years.
Oh, uh, Marjorie Randall.
look, when I had my hip replacement, Barry brought in my mail every day.
so you two were good friends?
Oh, yes.
did he ever discuss his work with you?
Oh, he talked about it all the time. He loved his job.
especially when he won a case.
do you know if he was in the middle of a particularly messy one?
Barry just always said that all divorces were messy.
do you think that that could've had something to do with his death?
we will do everything we can to find out.
how you doing with Cujo?
I don't know. He's still pretty riled up.
well, why don't you wait for Varanski? He's on his way back.
he'll help you muzzle the dog. Then you can get your evidence.
by the time he gets here, all the evidence is gonna be gone.
look at him. Look at him. He's licking it all away.
Hey, if you're thinking about opening up that cage, we're gonna have another crime scene.
maybe he's just threatened by me, you know?
I mean, he's in there, he's cornered, I'm coming at him with sticks.
open the gate, maybe he'll calm down.
Nick... - Hey, come on. Don't worry.
I had a bunch of dogs growing up-- know what I'm doing.
all right, look, I got Doc Robbins.
Nick, that dog killed somebody.
wait for Varanski. Please.
well, boy...
I'm not gonna let you destroy all my evidence.
I'm gonna process you, just like any other suspect, whether you like it or not.
so... here's how it's gonna go down.
I'm gonna let you out of this crate, and when I do, you're gonna be cool... and I'm gonna be cool.
okay?
easy.
easy...
easy, now.
how about one of these?
want a little treat?
cooperate, now, okay?
right in here.
cooperate.
right in here, bud.
easy.
easy. You got something in your teeth there.
easy. I'm not gonna hurt you.
well, it looks like you got your pound of flesh, eh?
when the kids were little, I bought them a dog.
a mutt from the shelter.
he slept on my daughter's bed every night-- part of the family.
Yeah, it's easy to forget they're still animals.
it's hard to make out the teeth marks.
may have to call in an odontologist.
well, maybe the saliva will give us the dog's DNA.
you said our victim had drugs on him-- I don't see any needle marks.
could be a new user. Maybe the drugs haven't taken their toll yet.
I'll send blood and hair over to Tox.
multiple cuts and bruises, defensive wounds.
boy, this guy put up quite a fight.
why didn't he pull his gun?
I think I know why.
when the dog attacked Nelson, he must have knocked him over.
the angle of the fall broke Nelson's arm in two places, rendering the arm useless.
well, that explains why he didn't shoot the dog.
one mystery solved.
hit the jackpot. - Yeah?
.38 Special.
just like the slug we took out of the wall.
that's not all I found: fingerprints on the windowsill.
killer saw quite a show.
I found semen stains.
no way a guy like Sloan wouldn't wash his sheets, so they're fresh.
and he wasn't alone.
lipstick?
maybe Mr. Sloan was sleeping with someone's wife. Or girlfriend.
Yeah. His job didn't get him killed, his penis did.
you're back from the vet? - Yeah. Yeah, they did a full workup.
the dog's healthy as an ox. And his tox came back clean, too.
but if there's behavioral issues, there's not much they can do.
well, I guess that makes him a dead dog walking.
Yeah, unfortunately.
well, his tox wasn't the only one that came back clean.
no drugs in Officer Nelson's system, either.
hair analysis proves that he wasn't a regular user.
if he wasn't buying drugs in that part of town, then what was he doing with all that cash in his truck?
I don't know. But I can tell you that he didn't steal it from evidence.
money came from his personal bank account.
he made a series of large withdrawals within the last six months.
well, he was into something.
Where's the dog?
animal Control. - What?
no, they're gonna put him down-- you have to stop them.
Why? What's going on?
the dog is innocent. He didn't kill his partner.
the saliva on Nelson's throat, it isn't canine; it was human.
start of the zombie apocalypse.
you know, we had a case where a cheerleader, high on PCP, ate another cheerleader's stomach.
Nelson's killer was high on something.
why was Nelson in a Cracktown, anyway?
he could've been setting someone up, you know, planting evidence to catch a bigger fish, things go south, he gets killed, I don't know.
but not before his partner took a piece out of the killer.
that flesh from the dog's teeth came back to... an unknown male.
I guess Nick sprung him from Animal Control.
Ah, there he is. Sam.
Hey, wha... - Sorry, he just got away from me.
I can't have him walking around CSI.
I know. Come on. Sam, come on. Come.
boy, you have a way with dogs, Stokes.
Hey, this pain in the ass may help us find Nelson's killer. I mean, he is our only witness.
Aw, no, hey, come on, that's my anniversary gift! - Drop it, Sam.
that is hand-carved. One of a kind.
drop it!
I know he's a highly trained police dog, but how the hell is he gonna help with the case?
he won't even drop an anniversary gift.
sergeant Varanski.
Hey, Nick. - Hey, man, how's it going?
good to see you. - Good to see you.
thanks for clearing his name; you really saved his life.
what you got there? What you got, boy?
say, if it's all right with you, we'd like to hang on to him for a while, see if he can help us track down Officer Nelson's killer.
sure. If anyone can, it's Sam.
best nose in the department.
there is one problem, though. I can't get him to do anything.
he won't even drop that stupid totem pole.
maybe you're not speaking his language.
no? What's that, "dog"? I could try barking or something.
French.
Sammy was born just outside of Paris. All the dogs come to us fully trained.
there you go.
go ahead, take his leash off.
okay.
guess I better brush up on my French.
well, that and, uh... earn his respect.
right.
so, you know those... fingerprints I collected outside the vic's windowsill? - Yeah.
got a hit in AFIS. Brent Walsh.
a casino worker in the middle of a divorce.
and Mr. Sloan was his lawyer.
that arrogant, despicable piece of crap.
I take it you weren't satisfied with his services.
I'll say. He was too busy satisfying my wife.
they were sleeping together?
Sloan is supposed to protect my assets, not hand everything over to that bitch.
that's when I got suspicious.
so you went to Sloan's house last night.
Yeah. I snuck in the side yard and I peeked in the bedroom window.
that's when I saw that scumbag sleeping with the enemy.
and then you waited for your ex-wife to leave, and you shot Sloan.
no. I don't even own a gun. I didn't want Sloan... dead.
I wanted him... disbarred, unemployed, homeless.
but you were there. You had motive.
I peeked in the window, and then I left.
Where'd you go? - I went to work.
I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift.
I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8: 00. You can check surveillance.
I will.
where can I find Mrs. Walsh?
at my house. With my cat.
and all my stuff.
you got something on Officer Nelson?
Yeah. I checked his phone records.
couple of hours before he died, Nelson got a call from a pay phone around the corner from the crime scene.
liquor store cam caught a glimpse of our mystery caller.
judging by the outfit, I'd say she's a working girl.
what's that in her pocket?
yellow bandana.
just like the one we found on Nelson.
I'm thinking he got the drugs from her.
DNA proved that a man killed Nelson, but if she was there, she could be involved, right?
or, at the very least, a witness.
okay. I'll have Brass round up all the hookers in Cracktown that look anything like her; maybe our police dog can pick her out of a lineup.
Oh, boy.
ladies... can I have your attention for a second?
first of all, thank you for coming in.
did we have a choice? - No, not really.
but I'll get you out of here as soon as I can.
okay, open up your jars there. Go ahead, open' em up.
Yeah, reach in and pull out the pipe, and hold it in your hand.
I'd rather hold on to your pipe.
uh, thank you, I appreciate that, but my wife frowns on that kind of thing.
where do you want me to put this?
just hold on to it. By doing that, you're transferring your scent onto the pipe.
if I rub it, will it get bigger?
young lady, as long as you're holding it, I'm happy.
all right, put' em back in. Thank you.
put the lids on.
there you go. Come on.
look, Sam, I know we got off to a bad start, and I know you miss your partner.
you guys were together a long time.
but I want the same thing you do-- to catch his killer.
I can't do that without your help.
you understand?
so... want to go to work?
Hey, Sam. How you doing, boy?
recognize this?
officer Nelson's partner did.
he identified you as the working girl who gave Nelson this bandana, which was full of methamphetamine, by the way.
Carly, we know you called Officer Nelson from a pay phone last night.
we know you met up with him and gave him the drugs.
and then you killed him.
gave him the drugs, that was it.
well, why would you do that? He wasn't a user.
ms. Green, we know all about you.
we know that Officer Nelson arrested you for possession and prostitution, and sent you to prison for nine months.
must have hated him for that.
so, last night, you lured him downtown and got one of your junkie friends to kill him.
no, that's bull.
Mike was the only person who gave a damn about me.
he even visited me in prison.
okay, so why did you call him then?
Mike used to pay me for info.
when something new hit the streets, I'd turn it over to him.
help him go after the dealers.
are you telling me, you're a C. I?
you were Officer Nelson's confidential informant?
Yeah.
it was Mike's way of giving me a second chance.
look, I gave him the drugs, told him what I knew and beat it.
when I left, he was still alive.
what are you doing?
the GCMS is broken, and the repairman's on vacation.
so you're fixing it yourself? Are you even qualified to do that?
I am a man of many talents.
I'm just saying, defense attorneys love to challenge our findings in court, and if this is not fixed exactly to code, you are gonna be in...
okay, can... can we just forget the GCMS for a moment?
can you and I talk about... you know?
no.
so, we're just gonna pretend like it never happened?
Yes.
now, when you are up and running, I need results on the red smudge on my victim's shirt, please.
okay. - Okay.
thanks for stopping in. - Yeah.
so, you and Hodges doing it? - What? No.
I think it's great really. He's funny, he's charming, smart.
he's like an awkward Jimmy Stewart.
okay, you know what? I kissed him. Once.
Really?
I was at the hospital. My dad had been shot.
it just happened.
and now things are all awkward between us.
did you get anything off the gun?
uh, did not get any prints, but it is definitely our murder weapon.
striations matched the slug we pulled out of the wall.
and this is where it really gets good. The gun was registered to Barry Sloan himself.
shot by his own gun?
so, Brent Walsh's alibi checked out.
but he claims that his ex was sleeping with the vic.
which would give her access to Sloan's house and his gun.
let's bring her in.
Hey, Doc, got your 911. What's up?
body was just brought in.
fingerprints matched a person of interest in your dead cop case.
okay, let's take a look.
that's Carly Green.
I interviewed her earlier today. What-what happened to her?
found her at the Blue Siren Motel with a needle in her arm.
apparent overdose.
Yeah.
heard Hooker Number Four OD'd.
detective just logged in the evidence from her motel room.
lots of condoms, needles.
live hard, die hard... so to speak.
bloody bandage.
did Russell say anything about Carly having other injuries?
no. Doc's doing her autopsy right now.
but I did find this LVPD envelope.
it looks just like the one we found in Nelson's truck.
there's 800 bucks in there.
Carly Green said Nelson was paying her as a C. I. so I checked with Sergeant Varanski.
said Nelson hadn't worked Narcotics in over a year.
well, Nelson must have been paying her from his own pocket.
unless he was paying her for something else.
I mean, she was a hooker.
she wasn't a thousand dollar a night hooker.
something was going on between them.
Carly Green didn't commit suicide.
D. B. take a look.
needle didn't hit a vein.
she has track marks. She was a regular user.
you'd think she'd know how to find a vein.
that's what kept me looking. Found this.
it's a needle mark right in the middle of her back.
she couldn't do that herself.
so Carly Green was murdered.
well, there's more. Ms. Green was also pregnant.
based on the thickening of the uterus and the size of the fetus, I'd say about ten weeks.
you know, she told me that Officer Nelson was the only person in her life who ever cared for her.
you think he was the father?
well, he spent a lot of time visiting her in prison, and he was giving her money.
all right. Let's take a sample of the fetus's DNA.
have Henry run it.
Absolutely.
all this time, I thought he was a dirty cop.
well, maybe he just got involved with the wrong woman, trying to make things right.
I didn't have sex with Barry Sloan.
Yeah, you did... the night he died.
we pulled your DNA off of his... penis. Mrs. Walsh?
all right, I did.
I know it was wrong to sleep with my husband's attorney, but sex with Barry was...
he just kept you coming back for more.
we have evidence that you were not the only woman who came back for more last night.
your DNA had company on his penis.
you know, the thing about a three-way is, someone usually ends up being the third wheel.
it wasn't like that.
I had wild sex with Barry.
when I was looking for my clothes, I found lace panties in his bed.
not mine. - Then whose?
Barry said he couldn't remember her name. Some neighbor he was screwing.
and how'd that make you feel?
not angry enough to kill him, if that's where you're going.
but you were angry. - Ooh, you bet your ass I was.
we got into a big fight. Then I went home.
what time was that?
around 5: 30, 6:00.
that's right around the time he was killed.
if you're really hungry, I'll share half my sandwich with you.
no. It's for the dog. He's not eating for some reason.
well, he lost his partner, you know? He's probably still grieving.
Yeah.
okay, here's where we are.
Henry matched the DNA from the fetus to that piece of flesh that you pulled from your dog's teeth.
so Carly's baby daddy isn't Nelson. It's the guy who killed him?
that's right. Yeah. He killed Carly, too.
that bloodied bandage we found in her motel room? - Yup.
also the killer's DNA.
and that's not all Henry found in the bandage.
bacteria and leucocytes.
the killer's wound is infected.
from the dog taking a bite out of him.
he's going to need medical attention.
Robbins already checked all the local hospitals and free clinics in the area.
no dog bites reported in the last 24 hours.
well, there are some back alley clinics near the Blue Siren motel.
what are you gonna do?
you don't have a name. You don't know who you're looking for.
no... but Sam does.
Hey, Sam? I got a little something for you... here.
thank God. Hey, I don't know how he got in here, but you got to get him out.
I know, David. I'm sorry.
Hey, boy.
I should have known I'd find you in here.
you really loved him, huh?
it's hard when you lose a friend.
you know, I lost a friend once.
partner in the line of duty.
I think it'll always hurt, 'cause... well, I know I'll never see him again.
but you know what you can do for Mike?
together, you and me... we'll get a little justice.
sound good?
did you know that, in a lifetime, the average woman eats four pounds of lipstick?
and that helps our case how?
I confirmed the red smudge on Barry Sloan's shirt as lipstick.
we knew that.
Yes, but did you also know that lipstick, like food, can go bad?
and to preserve its shelf life, cosmetic companies used to use formaldehyde.
there's formaldehyde in my lipstick?
formaldehyde is a carcinogen, so cosmetic companies these days use methenamine, which is a different type of preservative.
okay, so what about the lipstick in our case?
well, the lipstick in our case contains straight formaldehyde, and was manufactured by a company that went out of business in 1972.
are you sure the GCMS is working properly?
I fixed it myself.
Oh, whatever you say. But who wears 40-year-old lipstick?
Mrs. Randall...
Oh, call me Marjorie.
Marjorie, you told me that you and Barry Sloan were good friends.
that's right.
good enough to have left lipstick on his shirt?
CSI's are searching your house right now, and when they compare your lipstick to the smudge on Barry's shirt, I'm... betting it's gonna match.
lots of women wear lipstick.
this sample was much older than all of the women that Barry was sleeping with.
were the two of you intimately involved?
my husband left me ten years ago, for a younger woman.
I never thought I'd fall in love again.
till I met Barry.
for years, I never told him how I felt.
he always had some beautiful woman on his arm.
but the other morning, I heard him arguing with one of them.
look, I never said we were exclusive.
you made me think we were.
come on, okay? We've been having fun.
you really are a scumbag, you know that? Go to hell.
she was so mean to him.
so you saw an opportunity to make your move.
well, I wanted him to know that he was... appreciated.
that he was loved.
Marjorie. Everything all right?
I heard you arguing with that woman.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
Oh, no, no, you didn't. I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
you are so sweet. I don't deserve you.
what the hell are you doing!
I thought that... - You're kidding, right?
Hey, come on, you're old enough to be my mother.
he humiliated me. Just like my husband.
and you've been carrying that anger and that pain for all those years since your husband left.
so when Barry rejected you... you snapped.
Marjorie, we know that the gun was Barry's. How did you get it?
he gave it to me.
there'd been some break-ins in the neighborhood, and he wanted me to be safe.
I just wanted to be loved.
is that so bad?
the clinics down here fly under the radar.
if you can call them that-- no licensed doctors, no nurses, no questions asked.
well, whatever you want to call it, we're down to our last two.
only could be the dog's lost his mojo.
well, he can do this.
that's it.
go on.
he's got something.
great, he wants a burrito.
no, no. Hang on a second.
that's him!
police! Stop!
move! Move!
shots fired! Officer in pursuit! Send backup!
get him off me! I didn't do nothin'!
I don't know, I'm kind of new at this whole dog thing.
let me see, uh, hmm-- release him.
no, no-- drop him?
no, uh, it's...
you see, the dog over there thinks that you killed his partner, Officer Nelson.
you know what I think?
I think he's right.
you're under arrest for murder.
take this scumbag to the hospital, then book him.
good job, Fido.
Hey, Sammy.
good boy. Good...
I need a little help here, boys!
okay, sign it. Sign it.
did you get a confession?
Vinnie was a regular songbird.
he wanted Carly to get rid of the baby, so she went to Nelson for help.
well, Vinnie followed her. He sees them.
he's loaded on methamphetamine, he's tweaking out of his mind, he kills Nelson right in front of her.
poor Carly. Too scared to talk to us.
Vinnie couldn't take the chance, so he kills her. And her baby.
I don't know; I'm still waiting.
he's been in there for a couple hours.
Nah, nah, I'm okay.
Hey, listen, I got to go. I'll call you back, okay?
all right.
so? How's he doing?
Sam made it through surgery.
And?
vet said he's going to be okay.
well, that's-that's good.
I didn't even know Sam had been shot.
he just kept going.
that's Sam for you.
Ah, here he is.
Hey, how you doing, boy?
you did it, Sam. You caught Mike's killer.
he's going to prison for a very long time.
and we got some justice.
but don't you ever scare me like that again, you hear me?
you know, uh...
Sam was going to retire at the end of the year, spend the rest of his days with Nelson, just being a dog.
nelson didn't have any family, so, uh, Sam's going to need a new home.
well, I guess he could come live with me.
that'd be nice.
what do you say, Sam?
I'll take good care of you.
now, there's gonna be a few rules, okay?
no drinking out of the toilet, and, uh, we watch football on Sundays, and we root for the Cowboys. Okay?
and when my girlfriend's over, you got to sleep on the floor.
all right? Is that a deal?
okay, boy.
Ah, geez!
I saw a movie that started like this.
it did not end well.
alien invasion.
sheriff Anderson, Davis County. Thanks for coming.
CSI Russell, CSI Finlay.
what's with all the men in black?
nellis Air Force Base is down the road.
apparently they just broke a very expensive toy.
you said something about a grave over the phone?
a couple hikers called in about a light show.
I was first on the scene. I noticed some disturbed earth.
want to follow me?
three tours in Iraq, saw my share of mass graves.
they looked just like this.
roughly three meters square.
vegetation has barely grown back.
desert varnish is on the ground side of the rock, should be on the side facing the sun.
this area's definitely been worked.
there's only one reason to dig a hole this far out in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, here you go.
bracelet says that it's female. - Right.
excuse me.
this is a Federal investigation. You're in a restricted area.
well, ma'am, we just found a buried body, so this is now an LVPD crime scene.
you're gonna have to leave the area.
you know, if you keep insisting, you're gonna be in violation of NRS197-point-190.
interfering with public officers in the discharge of their official duties.
in other words, our body trumps your X-Files convention.
right.
let them have their grave, keep them out of my hair.
that's the first time that ever worked.
tissue on the extremities and skull is largely gone.
remaining tissue is desiccated.
what's it smell like?
smells like dirt.
it means the body's been buried for more than five years.
David, hold the camera steady, please.
Yeah.
well, the body's strangely preserved.
much lighter than what we're accustomed to seeing.
how many bodies so far?
three. They all appear to be female.
another desiccated fern leaf.
unless these bodies were buried in the Jurassic age, they're not from around here.
and neither's this dark, rich soil.
could be that the bodies were buried somewhere else, and then moved here.
look at that...military sure took off in a hell of a hurry.
I think you scared them, Finn.
Oh, Lord...
got number four over here.
this one's...different from the others.
completely mummified.
Yeah, tissue's black.
look at the facial features.
distorted from bloating, and the color change is from bacterial activity.
which means that she was exposed to the elements shortly after death.
so maybe she wasn't buried for very long before she was moved here.
the question is where were they all buried first?
rich, dark soil, fern leaves?
my money's on northern climes. more north than Northern Nevada.
David... removing a necklace.
what you got?
one of a kind, vintage pendant, one carat small diamonds.
flowery design, 16-inch silver Coreana chain.
two years and 1, 200 miles... we found her.
I haven't heard from Janet. Something is wrong...
Janet and I talk every day. She's a good girl.
Dr. Warren, We're doing everything we can to find Janet.
were you able to find me a recent photo of her?
please find my daughter.
I would like to be the one to notify Janet Warren's mother.
as soon as we have positive I. D.we notify.
do me a favor.
Greg's down at Autopsy, working the bodies. Go help him out, will you?
I can't believe that Dr. Warren has had to wait two years for this moment.
the last thing you should do right now is give that woman bad information.
come on. What are the chances that it is not Janet?
okay, the necklace. The condition of her body, the soil.
it all points north to Seattle, to Tom Cooley's ranch.
Finn, you're getting ahead of the evidence. Again.
he moved her body when we turned up the heat.
but you know what we didn't know back then, that we know now?
Janet Warren was not the only victim. This guy is a serial killer.
who sued the crap out of you.
and the Seattle PD, last time around.
and that was with one body, we got eight now, Finn.
you know I'm right.
and for the record, I am not getting ahead of the evidence.
just go help Greg, please?
Where's Janet Warren?
she's in there.
she should move to the head of the line.
that's not your call.
well, can you make it yours?
why are you working on her?
we really need to confirm Janet Warren's I. D.
well, isn't that why Russell sent us both down here?
have you ever had a case that kept you up at night?
I have been awake for two years.
Hey, we all know about you and your case with Janet Warren, and we're a team.
so if you're in, we're in.
let's get this Cooley guy.
thank you, Greg.
okay. Get her printed, and, uh, when you run DNA, can you do her first?
you do know that I'm not the DNA tech anymore.
I promise you I'll make it up to you.
another finger bone for you.
speaking of giving someone the finger,
Finn compromised a case in Seattle by illegally obtaining DNA evidence.
they had hair, carpet fibers and semen from Janet Warren's car.
Finn went after the suspect's exemplars.
why didn't she just get a warrant?
guy was juiced. Son of Seattle, lots of money, lots of friends.
and from what I heard, he had a snake for a lawyer.
well, snake or not, if this guy Cooley's good for one, he's good for all eight.
Hey, look what I found.
it's a ring.
looks like a man's.
so far, all the bodies have been female.
maybe our killer left something behind?
so, I found a lot of interesting insects at the gravesite.
a lot of them are not locally abundant.
Yeah, I recognize the rain beetle, there.
Pleocoma australis... how do you know that one?
Aw, I had them on a case once.
found a body in a shipping container...
the rain beetle told us that she'd been buried on land first.
any idea of post-mortem interval?
no, but I think I can give you a location.
this beetle, and the western thatching ant, tell me that the bodies were originally buried in the Pacific Northwest.
this is the pink millipede, found in the agricultural areas of Washington state.
okay, well that narrows it down considerably.
Yeah, but this last one is the reason you should probably give me a pay raise.
the horntail, Xeris tarsalis, game changer.
narrows it down even further, puts the bodies just outside the Seattle metropolitan area.
okay.
well, next question is why were eight bodies already buried just outside of Seattle, dug up and moved to who-knows-where, Nevada?
Yeah, a place so remote, you'd have to know where it was to find it.
that's a good question.
Greg. Have you seen Finn?
Yeah. I just got off the phone with her.
gave her the good news.
well, now you'll give it to me.
prints confirmed... it's Janet Warren.
Hi, this is Finn, leave a message.
Oh, come on, Finn.
I just talked to her.
are you keeping tabs on all of us?
thought you needed my permission before you can... track me.
exigent circumstances.
Hey, Mike, it's D. B. Russell. How you been?
got a little problem.
step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
I see they busted you back to working traffic.
this how you getting your dates these days, Mike?
you know, I'm kind of hurt you're back in Seattle, and didn't give me a call.
well, I'm only here for a day.
Yeah, that's what D. B. figured.
of course he called you.
I thought once I signed the divorce papers I'd never have to see you again.
here, get in my car. We're going for a ride.
are you arresting me?
because if you actually talked to D. B.you would know why I'm here.
with or without cuffs, it's your call.
where the hell are we?
trying to help you out, here, Jules.
uh, could you please not call me Jules?
that brings back a lot of bad memories.
Yeah, I've heard your version of our marriage.
you found Janet Warren's body, and some evidence that she was buried in Seattle.
now you think that you have all that you need to get that warrant to dig up Cooley's ranch.
Well...you're too late.
that son of a bitch.
after he moved the bodies, he covered his tracks.
there's no evidence that the bodies were ever even buried here.
well, you been gone for two years.
a lot of things have changed.
you can't go tearing down these people's homes. All right?
if Janet and the other girls were buried down there, we'll never know now.
you know Cooley did it.
Jules...you got a new job, a new life.
don't screw it up this time.
look, I'll drive you back to the airport.
you could drop me at my car.
I'm not leaving until I see Janet Warren's mother.
she deserves to know.
the press already took care of that.
she's already on her way to Vegas.
Dr. Warren, you're not going in there.
I am not just any grieving mother, I am a doctor, I'm a pediatrician, I've seen it all.
but you've never seen your own daughter dead on a slab.
I appreciate your concern.
I need to say goodbye.
Janet was identified based on fingerprints and DNA.
her physical features, as you remember them, are gone.
you don't want this to be your last memory of her.
are you so desensitized to death you can't even understand how I feel after two years of searching?
doctor, I believe you know CSI Russell.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry we weren't able to give you the answers you were looking for in Seattle.
well, you're giving them to me now.
and for that, I'm grateful.
now, I'd like to see my daughter.
Dr. Warren... please take some friendly advice.
remember your daughter in happier times.
this is the only way that I can be sure.
sit with me, just for a second.
you remember CSI Finlay? - Yes.
well... she found this on her body.
you've given me Janet back.
now go get that son of a bitch.
uh, your cell phone is blowing up.
Yeah. That's why I left it over there.
Finn is under the impression that I am her personal assistant.
if she's gonna get fired again, I am not gonna go down with her.
nobody is getting fired.
haven't you ever been passionate about a case before?
I am passionate about a lot of things.
okay, so...
take a look at this.
been working on that ring I found.
Hardison High School, Class of 1987.
Hardison High. 15 miles outside Seattle.
any photos of the class of '87?
she was limber. Bet you can't do that.
look who was Senior Class President. Tom Cooley.
voted "Most Likely to Become a Serial Killer."
time to answer your phone.
DNA hits on two of your Jane Does.
Stephanie Hollinger...and Sunshine Vanletti.
now, Stephanie went missing in 1999.
she was a 21-year-old coed from UCLA in Seattle for a Walk-and-Run.
last seen at a place called Endless Lounge.
trendy bar in Capitol District.
what about the other girl?
went missing in '02.
23-year-old fitness instructor, worked nights as a cocktail waitress at Zobo.
also in the Capitol District.
you know, that's the same area that Janet Warren went missing.
this could be Tom Cooley's hunting ground.
he had an office right around the corner.
well, he didn't have to work that hard.
tox results showed high levels of flunitrazepam.
date rape drug.
early 20's, athletic, blond...
most of the bodies showed signs of strangulation, broken hyoids...
M. O. is up close and personal.
he likes to look in their eyes as they die.
guy's a sadist.
lures them in, sexually assaults them, and then strangles them.
take a look at this.
a couple weeks after Janet disappeared, a witness came forward with this cell phone video.
last time Janet was seen alive.
with Tom Cooley.
her hand's on his thigh.
giving him permission to take her home.
Hi, this is Captain Robinson with the, uh, Seattle Police Department.
um, we're conducting a murder investigation, and we're searching for a list of students who purchased a 1987 Hardison High School class ring.
Yeah, I'll hold.
what did the poor thing wear home?
a smile.
Yeah, I'm here.
Oh, great.
could you e-mail me that list? Thanks.
excuse me, Captain. Remember, our guy lost his ring.
was there anybody on that list that ordered a replacement ring?
Yeah, a second ring.
there is one. What's the name?
is there anybody else?
okay. Thanks.
what, you think it'd be that easy?
she'd say "Cooley" and you'd say "Get in jail" .Let's go.
any good Seattle cop knows Eric Louie.
love you, Daddy! - Bye, guys.
Hey, Mikey. What the hell you doing in this neck of the woods?
well, we're following a lead in the Janet Warren case.
Oh, yeah. Heard about that in morning briefing.
I know you. You're a CSI.
fired a couple years ago, yeah?
uh, resigned in lieu of.
officer Louie, we would like to ask you some questions about your 1987 Hardison High class ring.
the one you lost?
thought you were working the Janet Warren case.
Oh, we are.
CSI Finlay here's with the Vegas lab these days.
we found your ring in our mass grave.
that sounds like an accusation. Do I need my guild rep, Mikey?
no. Just tell us how you lost the ring.
well, I didn't lose it.
I gave it to my high school sweetheart.
she told me she lost it, right after she dumped me for the quarterback.
well, I figured she tossed it.
Marla always was a bitch.
have you seen this "bitch" lately?
Yeah. In the kitchen. I married her.
these guys want to ask you some questions. They're okay, yeah?
I gotta get back to work. If you're done with me.
Yeah. Thank you.
coffee? - Sure.
fresh pot.
thank you. - Sure.
Yeah, I know Eric doesn't believe me, but I did lose his class ring.
wore it on a chain. It could've fallen off anywhere.
I was kind of wild back then.
do you know where you might have lost it, or what you might have been doing?
dating most of the football team?
Eric went through the cheerleaders. We were young, then.
did you ever date a guy named Tom Cooley?
no way.
I - I did date his best friend, for a week or two.
Max Liston? Quarterback.
really got Eric thinking about me.
you think...
Tom is responsible for all those girls? Did he kill them?
well, that's what we're investigating.
did you and Max ever hang out with Tom?
once.
Max took me to a party at Tom Cooley's ranch.
high-class booze, beer in bottles...
kind of a step up for me.
was that around the time that you lost the ring?
maybe. I don't know.
if I knew where it went, it wouldn't be lost.
like I said, I only went out with Max a couple of times.
anyone besides me need a refill on the coffee?
no, no, I'm good, thanks.
she's hiding something. - Yeah.
look, her husband's a cop, you know?
if Marla Louie is hiding something, it could simply be something she doesn't want her husband to know.
and that would make you zero-for-two up there.
is that your nice way of telling me that I shouldn't have come up here without getting your permission?
you shouldn't have gone up, period.
I mean, come on, what are you doing, Jules?
are you trying to kill your career?
Marla Louie dated Tom Cooley's best friend in high school, this guy named Max Liston, all right?
I'm gonna send you a link.
Max Liston, small-time Seattle contractor, gets big break.
Cooley hired Liston to develop the family ranch.
not just to develop, but to pave over eight graves.
if I wanted to dig up eight bodies in Seattle and rebury them in Nevada,
I'd would definitely negotiate with my contractor best buddy.
can we prove any of this?
well, here's where I go 1-for-3.
Max Liston became an instant millionaire, and he retired to the Virgin Islands.
Hey, don't even think about taking an island cruise.
well, you don't have to worry.
even I couldn't get this guy to talk.
so Max Liston gets a truckload of money and dies three weeks later.
I'd be interested to know what Tom Cooley was doing while Max was flunking scuba diving.
boss, you might want to turn on the TV.
Really? Okay.
today I've come to Las Vegas to offer a reward of $100, 000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer of Janet Warren.
in the last 24 hours, Las Vegas PD has confirmed the bodies of Janet Warren and seven other young women were recovered from a mass grave 200 miles from here.
two years ago, a chance meeting with Janet at a public restaurant on the last night of her life, turned my life into a nightmare.
look at that. He's making this about himself.
now he's the victim.
I have been pursued with a vengeance by an overzealous CSI who has had no regard whatsoever for the evidence.
Jules, you mind putting down the coffee mug?
can you believe this?
cost her her job...
but it cost me everything.
the killer of Janet Warren is still out there.
let's all of us work together to get him.
scumbag! He's playing games with us.
he thinks we're too stupid to catch him.
No! Not the TV!
it's my TV. I paid for it.
what you got?
okay, well, this is where we found the bodies.
it's federal land that was taken from a private party by eminent domain.
it was part of a big government land grab in the 90s.
a "Covenant of Appurtenant. " What the hell's that?
it's a lawyer's way of saying that land can never be developed.
good place to bury a body. No one's ever digging it up.
who was the previous owner?
it was buried under layers of straw corporations, but the law firm that handled the deal was Denton, Rutman and Schmidt.
now, they are the biggest real estate firm in Seattle. - Really?
Tom Cooley's family made all their money in real estate.
so that could've been Cooley land.
if it was, that would be enough to compel his DNA.
Yes, sir, it would.
my client will not be offering up his DNA.
we both know that particular glass is off the table.
how is CSI Finlay?
she's terrific.
Mr. Pearson, if your client wants to be so helpful, what the hell's he doing hanging out in the hall?
he's just waiting for me to make sure his rights will be protected.
this isn't Guantanamo.
okay.
captain Jim Brass, Tom Cooley.
pleasure to meet you, Captain.
sit down.
now, Seattle PD was investigating you as a suspect in the murder of Janet Warren.
here in Las Vegas, I'm making you the prime suspect in the murder of Stephanie Hollinger.
sunshine Vanletti, five Jane Does and Janet Warren.
well, this is no way to start a relationship, Jim.
captain Brass, we came here...
I've had a crash course in the legal system in the last couple years.
you can't arrest me just because you don't like me.
if I could arrest you, you'd already be in a holding cell.
now, the victims we've identified so far were all last seen a few blocks from your office.
heart of downtown Seattle. Population half a million.
and the evidence suggests that the bodies were buried in Seattle, then reburied here in Nevada.
now, that requires logistics. I mean like a dump truck and a backhoe.
it's a shame about your friend Max Liston.
we understand he did a lot of construction work for you.
Max was a dear friend and a good man. If you're suggesting...
I'm not suggesting anything.
but what I don't get is, why did you rebury them 1, 200 miles from home?
what happened in Seattle?
CSI Finlay put your feet too close to the fire? You had to get out of state?
okay, that's it. Captain, we're done here.
these unsubstantiated accusations, they're bordering on slander.
and I was just getting started.
we're staying at the Mediterranean, if there's anything else we can do.
Mr. Cooley, thank you for coming in, but don't leave Las Vegas.
what the hell... - Ah, single malt.
one bottle down, one to go. Nice.
Hey, could you give me your glass when you're done?
I was hoping I'd see you.
how about a drink?
Yeah, that's how it all starts, huh?
some blonde catches your eye.
young, athletic, looking for a good time.
and you buy her a drink. Hell, maybe three.
and you add a little sweetener; a little flunitrazepam.
must be hard for a guy like you to sleep at night.
you spend a lot of time thinking about me. I'm flattered.
I'm just getting started.
just like you, I don't want the party to end.
so what happens next, huh?
you say something like, uh...
Hey, baby, just a short drive to my big fancy ranch
and then, in her car, you get the sex part out of the way because you can't wait to get home and get your hands around their necks.
I am your type, aren't I?
five-foot four, blonde...
I'm looking for a good time.
but I don't expect much from you in bed...
cause you're inadequate.
is that your trigger?
how do you know I'm not gonna kill you, hmm?
that's what makes it so exciting.
Russell, identified another jane doe. missing person id#: AB-23 1881
Hey, Jim.
uh, she should be here in a few minutes. Landed about an hour ago.
Why? What's up?
okay, I'll be right there.
I just got a 419 at the Mediterranean.
sounds like Tom Cooley just committed suicide, sometime in the last couple hours.
try in the last 30 minutes.
look, I know you're angry. I know you think I let you down.
but I'm not the same person I was two years ago.
so you weren't in Cooley's suite?
I can explain.
but Dad, the soda machine stole my dollar.
it's Vegas, kiddo. Stick to the table games.
internal Affairs is gonna ask me questions.
so you be very careful what you say. I'm not gonna lie for you.
Mr. Pearson, this officer's gonna accompany you to the police station, take your statement.
Yeah, of course.
I can't even begin to understand this.
what do we got?
Gavin Pearson, Tom Cooley's lawyer. Supposed to meet Cooley at the bar.
Cooley was a no-show. He came up here looking for him.
banging the door, there was no response, so he called hotel security, and they cut their way in.
can I get a little help here? - Yeah. Charles, keep your eye on him.
you mind? - No, go ahead.
no, no, hold on.
so, a room service waiter gave a statement on the record that said he saw an angry blonde woman with police credentials and a service pistol banging on the door of Cooley's suite a half an hour before Security arrived.
now tell me that isn't you.
stay here... I'm gonna need to take your statement.
you know, this isn't just your job on the line.
unusual way to hang yourself.
usually, you find them hanging from the sprinkler head or a curtain rod.
as long as the hang point's longer than your torso...
that's all it takes.
are we gonna find your fingerprints on one of these glasses?
flunitrazepam. This is the drug that Henry's finding in all his victims.
both of the doors were locked from the inside. That works in your favor.
a narcissist does not hold a press conference and then, a few hours later, kill himself.
are you sure that's the argument you want to make?
Yeah. It's a homicide.
and we need to find out who did it.
well, whatever happened here, you're finally gonna get your DNA sample.
if I were Janet Warren's mother, I'd feel cheated.
I'd want to face this guy down in court, tell the world what he did, and watch him be punished for his crimes.
well, not in this lifetime.
so what are you thinking for C. O.D?
asphyxiation due to ligature strangulation.
suicide versus homicide, still undetermined.
Henry found flunitrazepam, 50 micrograms per milliliter.
BAC was point two-one.
alcohol three times the legal level, plus a heavy sedative.
Finn said he was wasted.
and tying a knot requires a certain dexterity.
think he could accomplish that?
eh, maybe, maybe not.
Mr. Cooley here had a fatty liver. He was a boozer.
and most likely, he built up a tolerance.
okay, until we're certain, we're treating this as a homicide.
I got Cooley's DNA results.
out of my autopsy until you've been cleared as a suspect, okay?
did you give your statement to Brass yet?
I'm waiting for his call.
Cooley's DNA matches the semen we found in Janet Warren's car two years ago.
okay, it's official. He killed Janet.
that solves one murder.
Yeah, how about all eight.
this guy has been murdering women for the last 20 years.
I don't think he suddenly grew a conscience and committed suicide.
so what's the motive for murdering him, then?
Cooley's not the type to get his hands dirty.
we believe that he had help moving the bodies.
Max Liston. But he drowned. He's out.
Cooley's got another best friend.
so, Cooley goes down, his best friend would go down.
Cooley's dead, case closed.
so, who is it?
I don't know. But I think I know someone who might.
you call me.
look, I'm sorry that you wasted a trip, but I already told you everything I remember.
well, you must know by now that Tom Cooley is dead. He can't hurt you anymore.
who said he ever hurt me?
Marla, listen to me.
okay, I was kind of a wild girl in high school, too.
girl with a reputation... she gets invited to a lot of parties.
and sometimes, those parties would just be me and a couple other guys.
you know what I'm saying?
expectations of my boyfriend of the weekend and those other guys.
there are eight girls dead.
you are so lucky to be alive.
Marla, you've got three kids.
what if something happened to one of them? Wouldn't you want the person who knew the truth to come forward?
the bastard's dead. What difference does it make now, anyway?
somebody helped him cover it all up.
probably the same guy who killed him. And that guy deserves to be punished.
Eric doesn't know about that night.
I didn't want to lose him. I don't want to lose him.
this is just the three of us talking.
Marla, you're the only one who can speak for those eight girls.
you were right, about the party.
it was just me and three horny boys.
Max, Gavin...
Yeah, the tagalong.
and Tom Cooley.
back then, I didn't know how to say no.
you know, I could usually hold my booze, but that night, I blacked out, and I woke up in the bottom of a hole.
she's moving.
bastards were burying me.
I didn't tell you to stop!
what are you doing?
town whore! No one's gonna believe you, anyway!
he was right.
the Cooleys owned the town. No one would've believed me.
and even if they did, Tom was untouchable.
what about Max and Gavin?
they never spoke to me again.
Marla, you should know that you probably did not pass out just from booze.
Cooley liked to roofie his victims.
did he rape you?
we know Cooley was still alive at 9: 40.
that's when room service delivered his second bottle of scotch.
waiter passed Finn in the hallway as he was leaving, and we picked her up on hotel surveillance as she got back down the elevator at 9: 47.
presumably, Cooley was still breathing.
what about Pearson?
he was down at the bar until 10: 18.
surveillance picked him up in the casino, clocked him getting into the elevator at 10: 20.
Pearson then entered his room at 10: 21.
he called Cooley... no answer.
called him again at 10: 24, at which point he called hotel security.
so Pearson had a window of three minutes to kill Cooley.
takes at least 20 minutes for drugs to be absorbed from the stomach.
Pearson admitted he had drinks with Cooley up in the room earlier.
so that gave him access to the man's scotch and his drugs.
plenty of time for them to kick in.
Cooley would've been passed out by the time Pearson came back upstairs.
so all Pearson had to do was string him up and let gravity do the rest.
I'm with you, Sherlock, but there's only one problem.
both doors to the room were locked. From the inside.
so how did the killer get out of the room?
same way he got in.
after Cooley's death, Pearson's key card stopped working.
need a little help here.
is that significant?
I mean, aren't those things always getting demagnetized?
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
but, Dad, the soda machine stole my dollar.
that's Vegas, kiddo. Stick to the table games.
out of order.
I'm sure you can get a soda on another floor.
it's a magnet. How'd you know...
Pearson's key card got demagnetized, right?
kid lost his money in the soda machine.
okay, so how does that help Pearson kill Cooley?
Pearson got into the room using this magnet.
got out the same way.
then he probably pocketed the magnet.
that's when he wiped out his key card.
he's a lawyer, so he knows he can't get caught with it.
so he sticks it to the back of the soda machine, and fries the circuit board.
guess we're lucky he didn't stick it behind the ice machine.
we would never have known.
you killed your best friend.
and your biggest client.
well, you know how this works.
if you cooperate, things can go easier.
now, I have eight victims.
four Jane Does.
I need names.
I have met a lot of people searching for missing loved ones over these past two years.
parents who are willing to do anything to bring their babies home, searching for answers.
but I was lucky. I had you.
and you wanted to find Janet as badly as I did.
I only wish that I could have brought her home to you.
you did.
you should feel good right now. - Yeah.
two years, two jobs, one marriage. But I got him.
Yeah, most people would've given up.
I'm sorry that I sometimes go too far.
I'm really working on that side of my personality.
thanks for sticking by me.
you're welcome.
you miss me, don't you?
sometimes.
sometimes I miss you.
all right, you ready to get to the airport?
there's a flight in the morning.
boy, there's a lot of live ones tonight, huh?
I know. You're used to the dead ones.
Yeah, they're a lot easier to work with.
thanks for coming out, helping us grunts in the Mobile Crime Unit.
you're welcome.
all the problems in the department lately - it's, uh, been hard making cases stick, you know?
well, that's why I'm here.
you deal with the whack-jobs, and I'll do the evidence collecting.
I'd like to think I'm going to miss all this, but I ain't.
what do you mean? You're not quitting, are you, Crawford?
no, I'm, uh, looking at a promotion.
Really? - Yeah. Detective.
a lot of opportunities now, so I'm gonna trade in my uniform for a suit.
well, congratulations, Detective. - Thank you.
Yeah, it's, uh...it's got a nice ring to it.
Yeah, it does.
excuse me, miss. Can we talk to you, please?
I ain't doing nothing wrong, Officer.
well, you're not doing anything right, either.
what's your name?
chastity.
can I see some I. D.please? - Lost it.
but you didn't lose your purse. Mind if I take a look inside?
you got some cash, a wallet and some condoms. Well, safety first.
no I. D. Debit card.
wait a minute. You don't look like Keith Dobson.
Yeah, it's not mine.
then what are you doing with it?
have you been arrested before?
no. Never.
here's the deal.
you start telling me the truth, and maybe you get to go home.
but if you keep lying to me, you're going to jail.
I've never had to patrol the streets like this. I mean, not even when I was a CSI-1.
it is a little crazy.
full moon tonight.
you know, not to discount the crazy, but no lunar effect on human behavior has ever been established.
what about horses?
Hey, Trigger. Wake up.
well, this grass ain't hay.
trigger just bought himself a night in the barn.
control, 3-0-5-Charlie.
sergeant Weiss requesting transport van to our location.
Hey, boys.
Adrian. Hey, man.
how are sales?
what did I say, last time, huh?
one more swing and miss - that is strike three.
that's life.
what's your name, kid?
I know you're scared, all right?
okay, here's the deal - you work with me, maybe you go home tonight.
just going to need you to come downtown and make a statement, okay?
we got a deal?
all units, 415-C.
Olympia Casino. Suspect possibly armed.
what are you all afraid of?
Hey, hey, I want you all to meet my dad.
we got in a little fight.
but, you know, it's all good now.
what's going on?
casino security called it in. A guy just showed up swinging a head.
right, Pops?
doesn't look like he's armed.
what are you looking at?
no, just dangerous. Officer, we need to move these people back.
LVPD. I'm going to have to ask everyone to move back.
Hey, sir, calm down. Put the head on the ground.
step away. Keep your hands where I can see them.
the blood is on your hands, not mine! I'm not doing anything wrong.
Hey, hey, sir! Hey, sir, there's another casino across the street.
dad, come back.
call for paramedics.
Hey, uh, guys, the head is fake.
please tell me you're getting this. This is awesome!
it's a stunt.
Yeah, that girl in the blue hoodie! Grab her!
Hey, get back here!
you, stop!
Vegas PD. Get over here!
running was bad, but, dude, that hurts.
hurt's just beginning. Joke's over, kid.
I think you're going to jail, dude.
only adds to my fame when my video goes viral. I'm gonna have more hits than that chick singing...
all right, you know what? That's enough of that. Shut up.
come on, man. It's not like anybody died.
get over here.
you got something?
looks like someone else got punked tonight.
but this is no joke.
everybody out.
you got an I. D. on our gunshot victim?
no. No, not yet. Wallet was missing.
what about vehicle registration?
well, it's a rental, but the guy won't give up the name till he clears it with corporate, so we're getting a warrant.
Sara is processing the car right now.
evidence says the shooter was in the backseat.
sounds like a pop-and-rob.
well, unfortunately, traffic cam footage was a bust, so in the meantime, I'll check in with the doc, see what he's got to say.
good Lord.
dude, I need my head back.
I rented it for the weekend.
this guy does special effects for TV.
very good, but very expensive.
sir, I need to confirm - is this your vehicle?
feel like I'm back at the Hollywood Division.
where exactly do you need me?
booking. Ask for Chastity.
you'll know when you see her.
I'm on it.
Hey, hey, hey, Crawford, when do I get my phone call?!
here's my statement. About buying drugs off that dealer.
can I go now, Officer?
you need to sign it.
here you go.
is your dad Dennis Reed? City attorney?
Yeah. He's not going to be too happy.
well, it could be worse.
next time, I won't let you off so easy. You understand?
Josh McClure, Florida license.
it's Joslyn.
Joslyn. You understand why you're here?
no. No, I...I do not.
you took a swing at a cab driver.
he started it, and I wasn't just protecting myself.
I was protecting the life of my unborn child.
have you been drinking tonight? Have you taken anything?
I take offense. I'd never endanger the health of my baby.
how dare you!
Hey, I need some help here! Somebody get the chair!
get your hands off of me!
calm down!
sir?
sit down! Sit back.
Joslyn, calm down.
what the hell is this thing?!
Joslyn, sit down.
this is a violation! I've been violated!
if my water breaks, it'll be on your head!
Oh, you hear me?! Your head!
Oh, no!
take it easy. Joslyn, take it easy.
$2, 300 in cash, and a stolen debit card. Pretty good night, huh?
I'm gonna need you to take off your clothes and all of your personal belongings.
jewelry, everything.
I'm gonna need the ring, too.
you'll get it back.
Mayans were right. World's coming to an end next month.
we should all be so lucky.
has Sheriff Liston talked to you?
no. Why?
well, I wanted to give you a heads-up.
when I got shot, the department gave me a medal.
what does the sheriff want to give me?
her job.
what? What are you talking about?
she's thinking of resigning, appointing you as her replacement.
resigning? No, no, no.
that's the worst thing she could do right now.
and-and I'm the last person who should replace her.
you should consider it. Seriously.
for the sake of the department.
look, Conrad, not everyone likes you, but everyone respects you.
and maybe more importantly, they trust you.
I'll admit, there was a time I would have jumped at the opportunity, but now...
I don't even know if I want to be doing this job anymore, Jim.
captain, we need to talk.
how's your head, Mr. Pak?
it hurts. Oh, but you should see the other guy.
well, the other head.
nice to see you still have a sense of humor.
are you here on vacation? - Electronics convention.
hospital wasn't on the itinerary.
those are some nasty-looking hives on your hands.
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.
shellfish, allergy to cigarette smoke, maybe.
surprised it's still legal to smoke in casinos.
you can get away with a lot in this town.
Yeah, like assault with a fake bloody head.
head was fake. Blood's another story.
the blood was...real?
could you give me a minute?
Hey, Greg, are you still talking to our prankster?
Yeah, I'm sitting right across from him. Why?
Hematrace on the blood from his fake head says that it's real, nonhuman.
I need to know what it is.
hold on.
blood from your prop head's positive for nonhuman.
nonhuman? You make it sound like I used alien blood.
it's pig's blood. Old-school horror movie, dude. Like any zombie movie.
Tarantino here says it's pig's blood.
that's what I was afraid of.
the guy he clocked is having a reaction.
could be viral. Maybe a blood-born pathogen.
Oh, great.
Yeah, we need to know exactly where he went on the Strip and how many people he came in contact with.
got it.
well, it looks like your wish might have come true.
you went viral.
awesome!
as in outbreak.
your pig's blood may have been tainted.
what are you talking about, dude? I'm feeling fine.
all right, dude, you are going to draw me a map. Everywhere you went.
and you had better find your girlfriend with the camera.
I'm gonna go find you another shirt so you don't contaminate anyone else.
you stay here, don't touch anything.
your gunshot victim's stippling indicates close range.
dead center, back of the head. Victim never even turned around.
tells me the shooter was quick and efficient, a professional.
or the shooter was someone that the victim knew.
or thought he knew.
doc pulled a. 22-caliber slug out of his head. Come take a look at this.
there's no rifling.
hmm, weird, right?
Yeah, usually see this when someone drills out the barrel of a gun to make it harder to identify.
Yeah, but that kind of modification would still leaves marks on the bullet as it rattled down the barrel.
Yeah, there's no sign of that on this bullet.
no.
So...I'm thinking the shooter used a sub-caliber device.
adapting a larger caliber weapon to fire a smaller caliber bullet, like using a. 44 to fire a. 22.
I'll get it to Hodges, see if he can identify trace from a sub-caliber device.
maybe we'll be able to tie the bullet to the murder weapon.
got to find the gun first.
stop pushing me, I said.
sit down.
I ran your prints, Chastity.
your real name is Heather Tile, you're 19.
you're from Butler, Pennsylvania.
you have prior arrests in Los Angeles and Nevada for prostitution and larceny.
look, I can explain that debit card. I asked a friend...
forget about the debit card. We'll talk about that later.
now, here's what I want to ask you.
Where'd you get this ring?
what do you mean, where I got that ring? That's mine.
no, it's not yours.
it is mine. - No, it's not.
you know how I know?
the inscription.
see, I had that ring made for my ex-wife.
that's her engagement ring.
so I'm going to ask you again, where'd you get the ring?
I already told you, I bought it for, like, 200 bucks.
from who? - This girl- we worked the streets together.
what's her name? - I don't know.
we call her Jersey on the street.
let me show you something.
tell me...does that look like her?
Mm-hmm, yeah. That's the girl.
Oh, man. That's my daughter.
it's coming. It's coming, it's coming.
my baby is coming.
Oh, my water broke. Oh, I'm out of time.
Joslyn, remember, we agreed, if I let you out of the chair, you were going to cooperate and be calm.
please, I'm bursting.
Joslyn, please, we are trying to help you.
the paramedics are here. They just want to take you to the hospital, make sure you're okay.
Yeah, to make sure your baby is okay.
my baby is coming. I'm not going to any hospital.
I'm having my baby here!
Joslyn, just calm down.
get her down.
looks like a war zone.
Yeah, war at home.
one casualty.
hospital said our pregnant transvestite was DOA.
internal Affairs is going to be all over that.
sergeant Weiss follow procedure?
as far as I know. Doesn't mean they won't be looking for a scapegoat.
quite a busy night on the Strip, Marko.
so where did you go after the Fashion Arcade?
uh, I went to the Olympia.
Oh, hey, Lydia, it's me. So, I'm here with the cops.
they think maybe our pig's blood spread some, like, Ebola or flu or something.
anyway, I need the camera 'cause they want to see who we messed with, so call me back.
like, right away.
Hey, Finn, if you're still at the hospital, I hope you're in quarantine because you do not want to be here.
I'm actually not in quarantine.
the hospital tested the pig's blood, and there is no sign of any virus or pathogen, and Mr. Pak's responded well to treatment, so he's on his way home.
so outbreak averted. - Yes.
I am headed back to the lab. I'll see you soon.
all right, bye.
told you everything was cool.
everything is not cool.
what is this?
this is a map of our prankster's trip down the Strip.
passing right by our John Doe homicide.
dude, I didn't see anything.
what about your girlfriend with the camera?
she was too busy shooting. Video.
so maybe the camera is our witness.
Yeah, where is it?
Lydia has it. She's not calling me back.
well, you'd better make up with her soon because that camera is evidence in a homicide investigation now.
so I ran the stolen debit card that we got off of Chastity, and guess what.
it was used to rent the car that Nick found our gunshot victim in.
did you get the driver's license?
name matches the one on the debit card, and the photo matches our dead guy.
so Keith Dobson is our John Doe...
and Chastity is upgraded from trick roll to murder.
Sara says the prankster may have footage of the crime.
now we may have a suspect, although I'm not so sure she did it all on her own.
maybe she had a partner.
um, what you said before about not wanting to do this anymore - did you mean that?
I'm sorry you overheard that.
I don't know what I'm thinking right now, and right now is not a good time to discuss it. Okay?
okay, but, you know, whenever you're ready, you know where you can find me.
okay.
I really did buy that ring, you know, and I'm willing to return it as long as you cut me a deal on that debit card.
so you want to negotiate?
okay, let's negotiate.
you know who this is, right?
that's good. Now, I want you to take your time because the next answer you give is going to decide whether you spend 25 years to life in prison.
I don't know nothing about that, man.
okay, what do you know?
I met him at the pool at the Tangiers.
him and his buddy - they...they wanted company.
and you - who did you go with?
no one - it was just me. They didn't seem to mind.
what? Don't give me that look. I'm telling you the truth, all right?
we'll see.
how'd you get that debit card?
I spent the day with them at their suite, showed them a good time, you know.
the debit card guy was clueless.
the other guy was more of a player. Seemed like a local.
kind of like that cartoon, you know, like the Country Mouse, the City Mouse, I don't know.
except, in this cartoon, the Country Mouse gets a bullet in the back of his head.
look, I-I stole the card from the guy while he was in the shower.
then he and his buddy - they wanted to hit the Strip, so I left them at the valet stand.
I'm telling you the truth, I swear.
the dead guy's friend - what did he look like?
not much different - just another college boy getting off on the Strip.
subject is a male Caucasian, 27.
cause of death is exsanguination due to multiple sharp force injuries severing the external iliac artery.
Greg, you okay?
Yeah, I...I just thought he was high.
I never imagined he would do anything like this.
we all have our own demons.
drugs only weaken our ability to confront them.
whatever delusions he was suffering from, clearly they got the best of him.
he may not have been as delusional as you think.
what do you mean?
according to the abdominal X- rays, Joslyn was pregnant- not with a baby, but, uh, definitely with bundles of joy.
he was smuggling drugs.
and like him, not all the product survived.
no wonder he had a psychotic break.
wanted to cut the baby out.
there must be at least 20 balloons left inside his stomach.
I'll get them to Tox.
if we can identify this drug, maybe we can figure out who he was muling for.
they did this to him.
I put our bullet under electron microscope magnification.
well, whatever it is, it looks like it's scorched right onto the bullet.
it is, and if you take a closer look, you can see the face of Jesus.
come on, man, it's been a long night, dude.
fine, be a secular humanist.
what you're looking at is a composite material - unpolymerized resin and calcium carbide.
trace left by a sub-caliber device?
could be, except that sub-caliber devices are made of brass or steel, not polymer.
well, maybe the killer is using plastics.
maybe even an entirely plastic gun. Think about it.
virtually undetectable, perfect for a robber working the Strip.
John Malkovich- In the Line of Fire- made a gun entirely out of polymer.
good movie, bad science.
a polymer gun can't stand up to the pressure of firing a bullet. It would break down.
okay, what if you only needed to fire it once?
one shot, one kill.
is that another movie?
it will be, starring my theory, coming to a lab near you.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
who would play you?
Hey, Greg, I ran those balloons Doc pulled off your pregnant transvestite.
drugs were a cocktail of oxycodone, fentanyl and meperidine.
that's prescription, not your typical drug-mule fare.
no, but already on the menu tonight.
what do you mean?
a few hours ago, Nick and Officer Crawford busted a dealer on the Strip - Adrian Dinan.
they took a baggie of powder off him.
the drugs the dealer was selling have a chemical composition identical to the drugs in your victim's stomach.
same drugs.
means Joslyn was smuggling for the same scumbag who has Dinan out there selling on the street.
looks like it.
Thanks, Henry.
you found the connection I was looking for.
these are some nasty photos.
nasty business, smuggling drugs for you and your boss.
we know who you work for, Adrian- Rolan Zahl, Mad-10's set leader.
he runs girls and drugs along the Strip.
sorry, I'm an independent contractor.
you want to stick to that story?
cause the drugs you're selling tie you to this.
felony homicide.
forget about three strikes. I mean, we go for "special circs," you get the needle.
I know you like to "make deals," Crawford, but it's my turn.
what the hell are you talking about?
Crawford here collared the wrong drug dealer.
that's BS. Adrian, I caught you selling.
not selling; sampling.
the white boy that he let go...
his name is Bobby Reed. He's a rich kid.
his daddy's some big shot lawyer for the city.
he's been moving drugs in clubs on the Strip.
good business plan because he and his friends don't look like drug dealers.
but there's only...one problem.
and I imagine he doesn't like people... cutting into his profits.
which is where the sampling comes in.
Bobby approached me with his product.
wanted to set up a meeting with Zahl.
thought that going into business together was preferable to the alternative.
let's say we believe you.
where do we find Bobby Reed?
you want me to help you with your case, you need to help me with mine.
Hey, babe. Finally. I've been leaving messages for you all night.
I thought we agreed, when you freeze me out like this, it's not healthy for our relationship...
Marko, Marko, that's not helpful. - Right.
listen, I need to put you on speaker.
do not put me on speaker.
too late. Sorry.
listen, I'm here with Detective Siegel. The cops really need the camera, okay?
Marko, I'm going to hang up. - Don't hang up!
uh, Ms. Kasper... It's-it's Lydia, right?
who's this? - Uh, I'm Sara Sidle.
uh, I'm with the crime lab, and I'm sure that you don't want anything to do with this, but in all honesty, a man was murdered tonight, and your camera may be the key to finding out who did it.
we really need your help.
you're right. I don't want anything to do with this.
okay, w-well, you don't have to.
uh, all I need you to do is drop the camera someplace where I could find it.
could you...do that for me, please?
where?
okay, uh, behind the Olympia Casino, there's an alley with a Dumpster for newspaper recycling.
you can dump it in there. - Okay.
Marko, you still there? - Yeah, babe, I'm here.
I'm dumping you, too.
all right, ladies, I'm going to ask you to step over here.
you find anything yet?
no, nothing.
I swear, why do I trust people?
this job should've beat it out of us by now.
wait.
sometimes life does offer up a surprise.
all right.
got blood drops. - What?
and some drag marks.
looks like a struggle.
blue hoodie.
Oh, my God, it's Lydia.
killer must've been looking for this camera, too.
instead of finding it, found her.
this is my fault.
whoever did this to Lydia did this because of me.
Marko, this is not your fault. It's not.
it's because of the camera.
I'm so sorry this happened, and I promise you that we'll find the person that did this.
I'm sorry.
got to feel for the guy.
hope he can forgive himself.
I recovered this from your victim.
looks like a. 22.
same caliber as the bullet that killed our gunshot vic in the car, Keith Dobson.
identical wound - single round perfectly placed at the base of the skull.
same caliber, same M. O.same killer.
I want you all to meet my dad!
so, did you find anything on the video?
I did. I found our crime scene.
Keith Dobson's rental car, and he has company.
Yeah, hold it right there.
it's a hooker we busted on the Strip, had Keith Dobson's debit card.
well, she told Brass that she left Dobson and a buddy at the valet stand at the Tangiers.
hard to believe that a hooker would lie. - Yeah.
so what about this "buddy"?
caught him on tape.
Ah, there he is - in the backseat, right behind Keith Dobson.
that's the kid we let go - we thought he was buying drugs, dealer said he was selling.
well, I think he may be guilty of more than that.
sadly, we don't have the smoking gun on tape.
thanks to Mini-Me in the Mini.
there's a bit of a jumble here.
There...it is.
Bobby Reed and Chastity high-tailing it away from the car.
leaving Keith at the wheel.
Yeah, not moving.
just like you found him.
it's not what it looks like.
well, what is it, then?
you know, I'm trying to be a good guy, you know, but all I get from you is lies.
you're gonna tell me the truth, or I'm throwing you to the wolves, so you got about five seconds to tell me.
I am telling you the truth, okay?
I had nothing to do with that murder. I met them for the first time at the Tangiers.
okay, we're done here.
on orders from Rolan Zahl.
Rolan Zahl? The Mad-10's set leader?
Yeah. I work for him.
you mean he's your pimp.
he asked me to pick up on Bobby Reed, so I did.
his buddy just came along for the ride.
he told me to...hang out with Bobby and text him, let him know where we were.
so Rolan Zahl had you keeping tabs on Bobby Reed?
he said he just wanted to talk to the guy.
talk"? Yeah, talk, like, with a gun to his head.
look, what I don't understand is...
so, Bobby Reed is in Rolan's sights, but Bobby's friend ends up dead, and you and Bobby Reed are seen walking away.
no, no, it's not what it looks like.
look, Bobby said he saw some friend of his on the Strip and...
he wanted to go say hi to him, so he just took off.
and me, I mean, I just wanted to get the hell out of there, you know?
I couldn't tell any... When we walked away from that car, his friend was alive.
and they looked a lot alike. Maybe if Rolan really wanted to...
come on. What are you saying?
you're saying that Rolan popped the wrong guy?
forget it. I already said too much.
number one rule for survival: always know when to walk away.
Jersey taught me that.
you better not be lying to me.
I'm not. And I didn't lie about that ring, either.
she really did sell it to me.
wait a minute. The two of you met in L. A?
no, I didn't meet her in L. A. I met her in Vegas.
Vegas? When?
couple months ago.
didn't know she was here, huh?
the two bullets we pulled from our victims exhibited not just the same trace, but, as you will notice, identical residue patterns singed onto their surfaces.
so what? Fired from the same gun, right?
yes and no.
Heraclitus said,"You never step into the same river twice."
well, truthfully, you never fire the same gun twice, because each time you fire a weapon, you ever so slightly alter its characteristics.
Heraclitus, huh? Go on.
all right. Polymer trace got me thinking.
maybe we're looking for a plastic gun.
identical markings got me thinking further.
what if you were able to duplicate a gun?
one you could use once and then simply dispose of.
John Malkovich, In the Line of Fire.
I love you. Uh, I mean...respect.
go on. - Okay, I want to show you something.
3- D printer?
the future is here.
they have scanners now that can scan an object to generate a perfect 3- D computer model, which is then fed into a 3-D printer, which then prints the object in three dimensions using layers of polymer.
now, that's cool.
primarily, 3-D printers are used to manufacture parts for antique cars and design prototypes.
and you think our killer... printed a gun.
multiple guns. Identical, disposable, untraceable.
fits the M. O. of a pro.
how much do these cost?
they're not cheap - around 150 K.
okay, so they're not completely untraceable.
get on the phone, call the manufacturer, let's get a list going.
Mr. Reed, thank you for coming in. I know, as city attorney, you're very busy and...
I can't believe this.
do you recognize any of these faces with your son?
this young man is, um, Keith. He's Bobby's college roommate.
this is Bobby's cousin, Josh, though I've... never seen him dressed like that.
you say they're both dead? - Yes. Along with a young woman, a witness.
Bobby's mom and I split up when he was four. She took him to live back east.
after college, he came to live out here. He wanted to make it on his own.
hospitality management.
mostly it just seemed like he went to clubs. I...I figured he's young.
so you...you really didn't know, uh, what he was into?
do you have kids?
this isn't really about me, Mr. Reed.
you know, Bobby has been playing drug lord, and he's pissed off the real one.
a vicious bastard named Rolan Zahl.
now, we don't have enough evidence to bring Zahl in.
but with three people dead, and maybe Bobby next, we need your help.
what can I do? - Reach out to your son.
tell him to come in and talk to us. Help us bring a killer to justice.
and if I can't talk him into it?
then he's looking at street justice. And very soon.
I ran Chastity's phone records.
she was definitely texting with someone about where she and Bobby Reed were all night.
texting Rolan Zahl?
I don't know. It was a burner cell.
10: 20 p. m."Leaving the hotel with Bobby."
burner cell responds,"Stay with him"
10: 32,"In car, heading for the Strip."
tell me where you end up.
10: 50,"Pulled over, Price and Boulevard."
keep him there, don't let him leave.
it sounds to me like someone was closing in for the kill.
that's when Chastity got out of there.
and Bobby sees a guy on the Strip he wants to talk to.
our dealer, Adrian Dinan.
and Bobby and Chastity take off, leaving Bobby's friend Keith behind.
shooter slips into the backseat, pops the wrong guy.
you know, Bobby and Keith do look a lot alike.
that's a good theory. But how do we prove it?
anybody order a break in the case?
I hate it when you do that. - You're gonna like this.
trace from our bullets- unpolymerized resin and calcium carbide
turns out to be a match to a 3-D printer model.
one that I believe printed our gun.
could I see that trace report?
so you proved your plastic gun theory. Congratulations.
how does that break our case?
purchase of said printer tracks to a car restoration shop on Madison Street in Northtown.
the owner: one Rolan Zahl.
Oh, looks like we're closer to putting the murder weapon in Zahl's hand.
not exactly Zahl's hand.
unpolymerized resin and calcium carbide. That is not the first time I've seen this trace.
what do you mean?
same results came back from Desert Palm last night.
they were looking for biologicals. A blood-borne pathogen.
the cause of an allergic reaction experienced by Mr. Anthony Pak.
wait a minute. Isn't that our tourist who was clocked by Mark Palmisano's latex head?
who also had an allergic reaction, apparently, to his own gun.
plastic guns aren't for everyone.
context is everything, and everything is making a lot more sense right now.
check it out.
Lydia's video footage.
he must have thought she recorded the murder.
it was no accident Pak was there.
no, man, he was going for the camera.
our tourist is our killer.
so, Dennis Reed convinced his son to turn himself in.
you know, unions, developers.
this was a negotiation I didn't think he could pull off.
I guess you can't underestimate the bond between a father and a child.
hasn't been my experience.
Yeah, sorry. I heard about the ring.
well, you know, that might have been one of the best days of my life.
I surprised Nancy, my ex-wife. I gave her the ring, took her to dinner, the ballet.
Yeah, yeah, ballet. I like ballet.
no, I can see that.
Yeah, there was a lot of good memories in the early years.
but I guess that's what you hang onto, the good times.
even with my daughter Ellie.
I'm sorry. That's got to be hard.
you know, when Nancy and I split up, she wanted to give the ring back.
I said, no, give it to Ellie. She should have it.
and then she sells it to that girl for 200 bucks.
that only means that she's in trouble, and she's not reaching out to me.
you know that guy? - Never seen him before.
well, he knows you.
lucky for you, he doesn't know you that well.
that's why he popped your buddy Keith instead of you.
you really pissed off Rolan Zahl.
he hired a hit man to put you out of business.
I know that. That's why I'm here, right?
I don't get it. You have everything: education, money, opportunity.
why the hell would you want to be a drug dealer?
you sound like my dad.
these men are trying to help you, Bobby.
you should listen to your father.
I've listened plenty.
I don't want to be a lawyer or a doctor or a banker.
might as well be dead.
I don't expect you people to understand.
what it's like to be a player. Prince of the city.
you do realize that three people are dead because of you, right?
that's not on me.
do you have any idea what you've done? What the hell is wrong with you?
I know exactly what I've done, Dad.
and I know where I'm going.
just like old times. You get weekend visits.
and, hey, maybe if you show up more often this time, you'll figure me out.
got something for me to sign, don't you?
we do.
okay.
so the college boy's in; what about you?
do I really have a choice?
right now, you're just looking at solicitation.
I'd rather have your help trying to bring Rolan Zahl in than bump up the charges to accessory to murder.
when this is all over... then what?
it's not like you guys are gonna protect me or anything.
Heather. Listen to me.
when this is over...
I'm gonna give you money and a bus ticket back to Butler, PA.
I want you to go back home, I want you to call your dad, I want you to try to build a life there.
and don't come back to the Strip.
Chastity's made contact with Pak.
I hope she keeps him on the hook.
looks like it's going down at the Fashion Arcade.
fashion Arcade. You got that, Nick?
Yeah, copy that. We got eyes on Bobby and Chastity.
backup's en route. Taking up positions.
I'm pulling up CCTV cams on the Strip.
I got Bobby Reed and Chastity.
there's Nick and Crawford.
any sign of our shooter? - Not yet.
Oh, wait a minute.
got him.
Hello, Mr. Pak.
Nick, we have a visual on Pak. - Where?
to the right of you at 2: 00.
Yeah, yeah, it... it looks like he's texting.
Yeah, he's telling them to go to the food court.
all units, converge on the food court. All units, converge on the food court.
Pak's on the move.
that's all right, we got him.
he's taking a shortcut.
where the hell did he go?
Nick, we lost him.
Yeah, so did we.
Where'd he go? - I don't know. I can't find him anywhere.
he knows where the cameras are.
LVPD. Drop the gun.
drop it or we drop you.
looking good, Weiss.
Pak's not talking.
not even to ask for a lawyer?
I'm sure Rolan Zahl has that all taken care of.
by the way, we searched Rolan Zahl's auto restoration shop.
no sign of a 3-D printer.
got rid of it.
okay, so what do we got? We got a gun and a phone with text messages, both in Pak's hands.
and Rolan Zahl's hands stay clean.
we do have Chastity's testimony.
uh, the word of a prostitute? Good luck.
okay, so Zahl walks, everybody else goes to jail.
no, she's got a deal that stays in place. She's getting a second chance.
she's a smart girl. I think she'll take it.
little help from the right person, I'm sure she will.
waitress was busy. Thought I'd give her a hand.
man, you are a tough guy to find.
I practically had to bribe your duty officer just to get your 20.
I just needed a little peace and quiet to finish up these reports for I. A.
probably having a field day with the bloodbath in the PD and cops letting suspects walk.
anybody getting the ax?
not if I can help it.
chicken soup? You don't like that stuff.
last time I saw you with a bowl of that, it was in the hospital.
well, I'm developing a taste for it, I guess.
what's wrong, Dad?
is this about the sheriff's offer?
I don't know, M. I - I guess I'm just not feeling myself lately.
these days, everywhere I look, everything in my life just seems so complicated.
everything, huh? Really?
no, no, I- I don't mean everything, no.
listen to me, I'm confused about a lot of things right now, but you and me, our relationship - that is the only thing in my life that makes sense.
well, my shift is over. Mind if I join you?
I'd be happy to have your company - always.
would it drive you crazy if I ordered a bacon double chili cheeseburger?
not if we order two.
I just got back from holding. Where's Heather?
who? - Heather Tile.
chastity the prostitute.
Oh, yeah, somebody made bail for her.
Bail- who? - I don't know.
you know, actually, she left something for you.
thank you for the......
what an incredible turn of events in this women's semi-final match.
second seed Tara Janssen is struggling to stay alive in this match against 18th seed Claudia Weber.
well, Weber's not just any opponent.
these two, very close friends off the court.
I know what it's like to play against a friend, and it's not easy.
it's a difficult proposition for both these players.
weber to serve.
a huge Janssen forehand.
weber's getting to every ball.
incredible rally ends with the easy unforced error from Janssen.
weber, now with her first match point.
you know, Lindsay, Weber has never beaten Janssen.
and this would be an incredible win for her.
Oh, biggest match of her career.
Claudia's husband and coach, Ivan, looks as nervous as she does right now.
and her father, also, who's cheering her on.
you know, he's never missed a match since she's been 12 years old.
a little tight there on that first serve.
nerves, maybe?
what a way to end it.
120-mile-per-hour ace to seal it.
wow, and Claudia Weber now advances to her first-ever premiere final.
Claudia, congratulations on an incredible win in front of your hometown crowd.
is it even more challenging playing against one of your best friends and doubles partners?
she's an incredible competitor.
that's what makes her a great doubles partner.
Oh, and I want to thank my husband and my Dad for believing in me.
and to all of you, who cheered me on.
thank you.
thank you.
mm, gosh, what a shame.
did you ever see Claudia Weber play?
no, I never did.
more of a basketball fan, really.
mm, she was such a great player. And a really good person off the court.
you sound like a real fan.
CSIs Russell and Finlay, meet Justin Gimelstob.
he's the one who found the body this morning.
want to tell us how you found her, please?
just going through my normal routine, trying to get a light workout in, hit some balls against the ball machine.
and I called the police.
we're going to need your clothes for evidence.
I'll escort you to the locker room.
thank you.
Clay's been disturbed.
medium force spatter.
Claudia was definitely killed here.
who says tennis isn't a blood sport?
here goes the last of the rigor.
ready?
wow, her right arm is quite a bit bigger than her left.
well, that's typical of tennis players. Their hitting arm's often more muscular.
you a tennis fan?
Yeah, my, uh, doubles partner and I are the top-ranked wheelchair team at our club.
liver temp. is 89. 5.
puts TOD at less than six hours.
shouldn't it be 12 hours? She's in full rigor.
physical activity so close to death sometimes causes the body to go into rigor a little faster than normal.
got a spatter pattern on her shoe.
clay mixed in, so I can't really tell if it's blood.
serious blunt-force trauma to the head.
she may have won the match, but she took a beating on the court.
ms. Weber was not only beaten, she was stabbed in the throat, too.
wasn't there another tennis player who got stabbed on the court years ago?
Yeah, Monica Seles. By an obsessed Steffi Graff fan.
right.
sports fans can be extremely passionate.
maybe someone was not happy that Claudia won that match yesterday.
why are you treating me like a suspect? My wife just died.
I understand that.
but if anything, we're doing everything we can to eliminate you as a suspect.
when's the last time you saw Claudia?
uh, right after her match.
I stayed for her press conference, then I went home.
you know, her car was still in the parking lot.
were you worried when she didn't come home last night?
she booked a room in a hotel across the street.
my snoring, uh, keeps her up at night.
and she wanted to get a good night's rest before the final.
she was on that court really late last night.
does she normally stay after hours like that?
she liked to hit balls after a big match at night; it would clear her head.
so anybody in the tennis world would understand that's... that's part of her routine?
athletes, they're creatures of habit.
do you know of anyone who would want to hurt your wife?
everyone loved Claudia.
okay, man.
the hardest part is telling her dad.
he just lost his wife last year.
Claudia's... she was all he had left.
I'm going to do everything I can to find out who did this, all right?
check out these scuff marks.
ms. Weber struggled with her killer.
got more blood drops.
some grass, little pieces of gravel.
could've come from the killer's shoes.
all right, I'll collect this section of the clay, and then I'll bring it back to the lab.
I got more blood drops, leading to the garbage can.
killer could've tried to dispose of the weapon.
it's empty; the bag's been changed.
well, looks like I'm going Dumpster diving.
excuse me, are you CSI Supervisor Diebekorn Russell?
judging by the suit, I'm guessing you're a government agent.
and, if you're DEA, the mushrooms behind me are medicinal.
I've been through this before with you guys.
I'm not here about your mushrooms, sir.
agent Smith, USCIS.
immigration.
all right. What's that about?
one of your employees, David Hodges.
David?! He's an American citizen.
he's got family in Canada, yeah, but, I mean, who doesn't?
how would you describe Mr. Hodges' character?
a little odd, but nice, hardworking.
to the best of your knowledge, has he ever been dishonest? - No.
never falsified reports? Tampered with evidence?
no, no, absolutely not.
does he travel internationally a lot?
not that you'd notice, no.
well, wait, no, he took his mom to Italy last year.
is Hodges in some kind of trouble?
you recognize that woman?
no, should I?
her name is Elisabetta.
we met at her family's vineyard in Tuscany.
she educated me about the acidic properties of the Sangiovese grape.
sounds romantic.
it was amore.
I knew then that we were destined to spend our lives together.
well, I-I certainly hope that Immigration agrees with you.
did the agent happen to seem overly suspicious?
raised a red flag, yeah, when I didn't recognize Eli...
why didn't you tell anyone?
um, what can I say? I'm a man of mystery.
Yeah, okay. Um, hey, very happy for you. Congratulations.
well, thank you.
I'm going to let you get back to your clay.
you know, technically, it's not clay.
american courts use crushed basalt.
Ah, see, I didn't know that. That's fascinating.
okay, good, um...
as you can see, being a professional athlete takes its toll on the body.
broken wrist, stress fractures in the feet.
come look at this.
brown discoloration of the cerebral cortex adjacent to brown discoloration of the subdura -
indicative of previous head trauma, likely a contusion.
how long ago?
no way to know for sure.
what about her current injuries?
three depressed skull fractures that left rectangular impressions approximately one inch wide.
is that the cause of death?
no, actually this was:
this vertical fracture bisected the thyroid prominence and fractured both superior horns, causing a soft tissue hemorrhage.
she choked on her own blood.
essentially, yes.
any idea what the murder weapon is yet?
well, the margins of the wound are jagged and the puncture's less than an inch deep.
doesn't appear to be a knife, but at this point, I can't say for certain what it was.
so, Ernest, what time did you change the trash bags on that court?
uh, start of my shift, around 6: 00 a. m.
you, uh, see anything unusual in there?
I don't look in the bags, not since a player on the court had food poisoning.
bags were full of puke.
Oh, well, that's great.
you don't mind going first, do you, Greg?
so, this is, uh, everything from yesterday and this morning.
okay. Thank you, Ernest.
here we go.
broken tennis racket.
this could be our murder weapon right here.
looks like there's some blood on it.
well, Claudia had blunt-force trauma to the head.
killer must have hit her with that racket and broke the frame.
Yeah, and then used this sharp edge to stab her in the throat.
you know, I know tape on the handle absorbs sweat.
well, that means DNA.
got some results for you.
Hey, Henry... you're friends with Hodges, right?
uh, depends on the day.
did you know that he was engaged?
you know, I heard it from Rick, in QD, who heard it from Arlene in Reception.
word travels fast around here.
Yeah, well...Ever since Hodges accused me of trying to steal Wendy...
wait, who's Wendy?
our old DNA analyst.
sorry. Uh, anyway, since then, he doesn't really confide in me anymore.
okay, you have some results for me. - I do.
blood on the frame of the tennis racket was a match to our victim Claudia Weber.
so, it's definitely the murder weapon.
she was also the major contributor of DNA on the handle.
killed by her own racket.
but there was a minor contributor of touch DNA on the handle, as well.
and get this: It came back to Tara Janssen, the player that Weber just beat in the semifinals.
I guess Tara was a sore loser, after all.
ms. Janssen, would you mind?
Oh, not at all. Of course.
Hey, break it up.
ms. Janssen, I hate to drag you away from your adoring fans, but we have to talk.
please, come with me.
Claudia was like a little sister to me.
I've known her since she was 14.
how could you possibly think that I'd do anything to hurt her?
because your DNA was on her tennis racket, which just so happens to be the murder weapon.
let me show you.
Claudia and I both used the Ace-Trak 528 racket.
a couple of times, when we were playing doubles, we grabbed each other's by mistake.
okay.
ms. Janssen, let me ask you something.
what's the prize money on these kind of tournaments?
half a million.
that's a good chunk of change.
so when Claudia knocked you out of the tournament, you obviously lost your shot at the cash.
I'm not interested in the prize money.
I made $11 million in endorsement deals last year.
so you do it for the glory; for the love of the game.
I'm chasing history.
17 more wins, and I'll break the record for most career singles titles.
but, you know, let's face it, I mean, you're pushing 30.
I mean, that's not old, but in tennis, that's old.
and young up-and-comers like Claudia could get in the way of you chasing your legacy, right?
listen, no one likes to lose, but... she deserved to win.
she played a great match. And I was happy for her.
you weren't always such a gracious loser.
let me show you something.
this was taken about a month ago.
that ball was out?
that ball that landed right there, that was out?
where were you between 11: 00 and 1: 00 last night?
I had a late dinner with Chris Evert, and then I went home and I went to bed.
ms. Evert? I'm CSI Finlay.
I need to ask you some questions about Tara Janssen.
sure, but can it wait? I'm right in the middle of a workout.
can I borrow your racket for a moment?
thank you.
you play?
a little. When I was a kid.
but enough to keep the ball going, so we can talk.
let's see what you got.
so what was your relationship with Tara?
well, she's been getting some code violations lately, and I'm really trying to help her with her anger issues.
when was the last time you saw her?
last night, after a match.
we were just chatting about her game.
grabbed a bite, and then I just dropped her off at her condo.
what time was that?
a little before midnight.
did Claudia Weber have any issues with anybody on the tour?
no, not the players.
but she hasn't been too happy about her coach lately.
is that her husband Ivan?
Yeah. She actually has been thinking about firing him.
Really?
she asked me if I'd be interested in coaching her.
Where'd that come from? You holding out on me?
I learned it from watching you.
thank you.
what is the problem, baby?
are you ashamed with me?
Elisabetta, mio amore, please calm down. Calmati.
Calmati. No.
Potresti avere all spoiled.
do you understand me?
Si. Si. Si.
who is that?
I'm trying to figure out what she's saying.
if my translate app is correct, it's something about a green card.
don't worry. Everything will be okay. - Okay?
Si. Bene.
non okay.
like I'm invisible, or what?
Ti amo.
no, it's-- I didn't want to tell anybody about you yet.
non soon pronto.
cold toes?
Oh, she means cold feet.
no. No cold feet.
there is another woman in your life?
Qualche bionda bimbo Americana?
no, wait...
Oh, she thinks there's another woman.
Yeah, I got that.
Elisabetta... there is only you.
sei l'unica donna...che amo.
you drive me crazy, David, you know that?
I love you.
I have never been jealous of Hodges until this moment.
now everybody knows who I am.
you have something for me, right?
Yes.
uh, Hodges found traces of chewing tobacco in the clay.
it's the same trace that Finn pulled off the victim's shoes.
guess who the DNA comes back to.
why'd you lie to me, Ivan? - What do you mean?
you know as well as I do you were on that practice court with Claudia last night.
chewing tobacco is a dirty habit.
when you spit, you got some on your wife's shoes.
we have DNA to prove it's yours.
we know Claudia was shopping around for a new coach.
you were about to be fired by your wife.
that's got to be a serious blow to the ego, man.
you couldn't handle it, so you killed her.
No! No.
I went there to talk to her.
you just had the best game of your career, and you want to fire me?!
I can't take orders from you on the court and then come home to you at night. It's too hard.
so, that's it? You're just gonna get rid of me, huh? I'm gone.
if we want to try and make this marriage work, you can't be my husband and my coach.
I agreed to do whatever it took to save our marriage.
and how long had you two been having trouble?
about a year.
the last month had been the worst.
she hadn't been herself. - What do you mean?
she'd been having nightmares.
she was calling out some guy's name. Brent.
is that somebody on tour?
not that I know of.
when I asked her about it, she wouldn't tell me.
she'd been kind of secretive lately.
is it possible that your wife was having an affair?
I don't think so.
Claudia was the most honest, decent person that I ever met.
this is the last of what was collected from Claudia Weber's locker.
cat treats...three different kinds of hand lotion.
learn a lot about a woman from what she keeps in her purse.
same goes for her tennis bag.
Oh, what's this thing called? A Blossom Ballerina?
Oh, yeah.
my daughter had one of those. Took it everywhere.
athletes tend to be superstitious. Maybe it was a good luck charm.
receipts from Tasty Time and Choozies Chicken.
well, players burn a lot of calories, and fast food is an easy way to replace them.
their dirty little secret.
she might have another secret, too.
this looks like LSD.
man, that takes me back.
wait, you took LSD?
no. No, my folks did.
Hey, wasn't illegal until 1966.
okay. But Claudia Weber's tox was clean.
and as you know, or your folks, should know...
LSD doesn't stay in your system for more than a half an hour.
you know, her husband thought that she was keeping a secret from him.
this would be quite a doozy.
but LSD isn't a performance enhancer. It's recreational.
so, pressures of the game, maybe it was Claudia's way of coping.
he also said that she was having nightmares about a guy named Brent.
didn't think he was part of the tennis world. Maybe he's part of this world.
we got a print here.
Darcy Shaw. Felony drug distribution.
I'm not a drug dealer. I'm a doctor.
well, Ms. Shaw, says here you, uh, took an online course in hypnotherapy.
that doesn't really qualify you as a physician.
or give you the right to dispense illegal drugs.
mind-altering drugs like LSD have been used for thousands of years to help open the mind and connect the body with the soul.
along with hypnotherapy, this can be a valuable tool in healing both mental and physical ailments.
and what ailment were you treating Claudia Weber for?
Claudia had been having violent dreams, and I believe that they were repressed memories of a traumatic experience that happened when she was four.
what kind of a traumatic experience?
I think that someone viciously attacked Claudia and her mother.
she actually remembered this happening?
well, recovered memories-- it's not like a movie with a beginning, middle and an end.
it comes in flashes.
and the brain doesn't want to remember. It's...It's too painful.
so how's that work? What, do you interpret those flashes, do you?
I wasn't influencing Claudia's memories, if that's what you're implying.
I was just there to guide her safely through the process.
I recorded the sessions if you'd like to see them.
as I continue to talk, you feel a heavy, relaxed feeling come over you.
with every word that I say, it's putting you faster and deeper into a peaceful state of hypnosis.
how old are you, Claudia?
four.
look at that. She's already under the influence.
the LSD is making her prone to suggestion.
maybe it's just making it easier for her to tap into her subconscious.
where are you?
I'm in the woods.
who is with you?
I'm in a tent. By myself.
I'm scared.
no one can hurt you. You're safe.
mommy?!
they're hurting her.
who's hurting her?
I don't know.
I need you to stay in the tent. All right, everything's going to be okay.
I won't let anything happen. Stay here.
Brent! - Who's Brent?
okay, so that was her last session.
what are you thinking?
she talks about this guy Brent, from her past, who tried to save her.
if any of this even happened.
why would you say that?
because it's a memory from when she was four years old.
trust me, kids' memories are not the most reliable.
they have vivid imaginations.
Charlie-- he swears that he fell off a horse when he was five years old.
never happened.
but look at Claudia's autopsy report.
doc found evidence of an old brain injury right where she said she got hit by the shovel.
I mean, don't you think it's strange that Claudia starts having childhood memories of someone trying to kill her, and then, one month later, she's dead?
I mean, that cannot be a coincidence.
timing is interesting.
I'm thinking that whoever tried to kill her when she was a kid came back to finish the job.
Mr. Weber, I am so sorry for your loss.
your daughter was such a talented athlete.
thank you.
you said you had some questions you wanted to ask me.
I do. Did you and your family ever go on a camping trip when Claudia was little?
no.
my wife wasn't really the, uh...the roughing-it type. Why?
well, about month ago, Claudia started having memories from when she was four.
a camping trip where both she and her mother were violently attacked.
we always wondered what happened.
what do you mean?
I'm not Claudia's biological father.
when she was four years old, I found her lying unconscious by the side of the road, up in Mount Charleston.
she was bleeding, she was near death.
I picked her up, and I took her to the hospital.
did you report it to the police?
well, of course. I told them.
they searched the area where I found her, but they... they never found her family.
did Claudia ever tell anyone what happened to her?
she didn't remember anything.
the only way we figured her name was Claudia is because it was, uh... it was written on her jacket.
did anyone ever come looking for her? Were there any missing persons reports?
nothing. I mean, we just assumed she was abandoned.
social Services let my wife and I become foster parents, and then, um...
well, eventually, we adopted her.
did you tell Claudia any of this?
we just wanted her to feel like she was ours.
and she was ours.
we thought it was a blessing she didn't remember what happened to her.
so, these were taken at the hospital the day Claudia was found.
she suffered severe head trauma, dehydration and multiple cuts and abrasions.
you know, a head injury would explain why she couldn't remember anything.
Yeah, not to mention the emotional trauma from the attack.
you know, in all her sessions, Claudia never mentioned a daddy, just Brent.
could be a brother, stepfather, mother's boyfriend.
Hey, look at that-- Blossom Ballerina.
just like the one you found in Claudia's tennis bag.
it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years.
if she had that toy when she was attacked, there still could be evidence on it.
I'll get it to Hodges.
you decapitated Blossom Ballerina.
well, I assure you, she didn't feel a thing.
so, I talked to Simon Weber. His wife passed away a year ago.
he was cleaning out his house, going through boxes.
he came across a box of Claudia's old toys.
sent them to her last month.
could be seeing this toy is what triggered her memories.
and if we can figure out who tried to kill her back then, we might be able to find out who killed her now.
exactly.
was there something else?
Yeah.
Elisabetta. That's...
she's something, isn't she?
Oh, yeah. Firecracker.
she is Italian.
I'm just surprised you got engaged so quickly.
well, when you know, you know, right?
but...you guys haven't known each other that long, and...marriage is not something you rush into.
I would just hate to see you get hurt.
Yeah. Uh, don't worry about me.
what if this woman is using you to get a green card?
Yeah. Why would a beautiful, amazing woman want to marry me, right?
that is not what I meant at all.
you know I think you are a great guy; you know that.
it took me ten months to choose a new cell phone last year.
I analyzed consumer reports, data rates, battery longevity.
for once, I'm following my heart, not analyzing everything.
and that's great, but you don't have to go from one extreme to the other.
can't you just be happy for me?
I don't trust this woman.
there's no other way to say it. And deep down in your heart, I don't think you do, either.
if you thought this was a real relationship, you'd be shouting it from the rooftops, right?
this is exactly why I didn't say anything to anyone.
because I knew this is how you'd all react.
I just didn't expect it from you.
I love Elisabetta.
unless immigration gets in the way, I'm going to marry her.
Hey, what do you got?
well, Hodges found traces of Claudia's blood on that Blossom Ballerina.
lack of solubility suggested it was a very old blood sample.
so she did have it during the attack.
well, you know, even though Claudia was rescued, her mom never came looking for her.
Yeah, well, maybe Mom and Brent never made it out of those woods.
exactly.
Hodges found something else mixed in with the blood. Sulfur.
so, I've pulled up a map of Mount Charleston. There are several sulfur springs in the area.
well, according to the police report, Simon Weber found Claudia on a service road just South of Echo Cliff.
Oh, there's a sulfur spring less than five miles from there.
Yeah, let's get some ground-penetrating equipment out there, see what we can find.
clear!
clear!
well, I have a hit.
looks animal. Maybe coyote.
clear.
Hey, I got something.
that's too big to be an animal.
one male, one female.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we just found Mom and Brent.
based on the dimensions of the injuries and the extent of the trauma, weapon used could have been some sort of wide-based tool.
like a shovel?
Yeah, injuries are consistent with a shovel.
just like Claudia remembered.
take a look at the extent of the injuries to the male.
multiple depressed skull fractures...ring fracture at the base of the skull.
he was nearly decapitated.
so he took the brunt of the killer's rage.
Hey, got DNA results, and we've restored the I. D.s found at the grave site.
these are actually both Claudia's biological parents. - Both?
meet Karen...and Martin Abbott.
Martin. Who the hell's Brent?
brent was their son.
Karen and Martin Abbott were from Montana.
brent was their oldest child, and when he was 12, they had Claudia.
all-american family.
well, not exactly. Martin Abbott had a record.
for what?
assault and credit card fraud.
when the family disappeared, he had several outstanding warrants.
maybe that's why nobody reported the family missing.
thought they just skipped town.
okay, Abbott family gets the hell out of Dodge.
they go camping up in Nevada.
parents end up dead, Claudia barely escapes with her life, and Brent-- nowhere to be found.
so Brent is either our killer or he is still buried out in those woods.
Claudia thought her brother was still alive.
I went through her phone records.
for the past few weeks she's been calling Brent Abbotts across the country.
she was calling Brent Abbotts up until the day she was killed.
I contacted a few of them.
Claudia asked them all the exact same question: were they on a camping trip 18 years ago?
what if one of these Brent Abbotts really was her brother?
and he got nervous that she was remembering what happened in those woods.
that he killed their parents, tried to kill her.
so he returns to Vegas to shut her up for good.
got away with murder once, probably thought he could do it again.
only problem is, Claudia called at least 50 Brent Abbotts.
how do we figure out which one's our killer?
Hey, Finn.
I've done some more checking into Martin Abbott.
now, according to his rap sheet, he's used several aliases.
one of them-- Ernest Prestwich.
why does that sound familiar?
well, Ernest Prestwich is a janitor at the tennis center, but that's not his real name.
according to his contact information, he has an L. A. cell registered to Brent Abbott.
so Brent used one of his dad's aliases but forgot to change his cell phone number.
I cross-referenced Claudia's phone records.
she called him a week ago.
that's great. Let's bring him in.
patrol just picked him up at a service station.
looks like the past finally caught up to you, Brent.
we found your parents' bodies on Mount Charleston, right where you buried 'em.
after you beat them to death with a shovel.
we get it.
your old man was bad news.
I did some digging into your history.
I know you made a lot of trips to the ER.
I know that that son of a bitch beat the crap out of you since you were eight years old.
we understand.
Yeah, the cops even came to your house a few times, and your mother never pressed charges.
she always covered for him.
she would always say that the bruises were from fights at school and the broken bones were from football.
and on this family camping trip you decided to end the abuse once and for all.
am I right?
we were in the middle of the woods.
so I waited for everyone to fall asleep and I took out Dad first.
your dad abused you and your mom did not protect you.
but why would you try to kill your four-year-old little sister?
I didn't mean to hurt Claudia.
I told her to wait in the tent; she didn't listen.
I thought she was dead.
I went to dig the grave.
when I turned around, she was gone.
but she saw what you did.
is that why you showed up 18 years later and killed her?
I, I didn't kill her.
I looked her up and saw that she was playing in Vegas.
I didn't come here to kill her.
I came here to, to talk to her, explain my side of the story.
okay. What'd she say?
I didn't get a chance to talk to her.
I went to the courts that night, and she wasn't there... so I left.
I didn't kill my sister.
give me a polygraph or take my DNA - whatever it is you people do-- but I didn't kill Claudia.
what time did you leave the court?
it, it was, like, 1:00.
can anyone verify that?
it was pretty deserted.
no, there was the other, uh, tennis player, though, um, Janssen, Tara Janssen.
she was there.
what was she doing?
I don't know, practicing, I guess.
she had a basket full of tennis balls.
we found your prints in Claudia Weber's blood.
game. Set. Murder.
you know, I always thought that you just killed Claudia 'cause you were a sore loser, but...murder over an off day seemed a bit extreme, so...we took a closer look.
you know, I always wondered what players said to each other after a match, so we isolated and boosted the audio.
good match.
by the way, I'm sleeping with your husband.
Ooh, that's cold.
I probably would have just stuck with a handshake.
out of curiosity, how long have you been involved with Ivan?
almost a year.
he and Claudia were having problems long before I came into the picture.
so, instead of helping your friend, you helped yourself to her husband.
I loved him.
he was going to ask Claudia for a divorce. That's why he went over there that night.
I'm sorry, I know, she doesn't...
but instead he told her that he still loved her and that he wanted to work on their marriage.
Claudia agreed to give him a second chance.
she didn't even love him.
she just didn't want me to have him.
that's enough to set anybody off, especially someone with a temper like yours.
she took everything from me that night.
she took the match and she took Ivan.
I hated her for that.
I killed her and I stuffed her body in the ball machine.
me and Ivan-- we were good together.
we were.
she just should have walked away.
Yeah, but she didn't, so you eliminated your competition on and off the court.
so, instead of serving aces, all you'll be serving is time.
Hey, glad I caught you.
Oh, hi, I was just going to get dinner with my dad.
Oh, tell him I said hi.
I just wanted to thank you.
my lawyer called and told me that you talked to Immigration;
gave me a glowing character reference.
seemed like it couldn't hurt, right?
Yeah, but you weren't exactly supportive of my relationship with Elisabetta.
you're my friend, and I just want what's best for you, so, if she makes you happy, then it's good enough for me.
thank you.
I should go.
so, I guess Tara Janssen will go down in the history books after all.
Yeah, just not the way she wanted, I'm guessing.
so now you can take her spot on the tour.
that's funny.
now, don't be so modest.
I heard that Chris Evert said you had some real talent.
well...I did play a lot when I was a kid.
you ever think about turning pro?
Oh, when I was 15, yeah, for a second.
what happened?
life happened.
well, I'm glad it did.
Yeah, me, too.
Bravo, Silvana, save some of that for opening night.
Silvana's on fire.
we're gonna make some money, bro.
good for you... and for your club.
well, good for all of us, right?
this is not about the money for me, bro.
it's about the soul of Cuba.
the music.
Cuidado, Vegas, Silvana has arrived.
Vegas is just the beginning.
sure, sure, sure.
Necesitamos hablar press.
we do the local news, and after the first show, CNN, Fox, MSNBC.
the sky's the limit. Come on.
No!
thank you.
Hey, fellas, what do we got?
Marta Cuerto, 32, Cuban national.
sister to Silvana Cuerto,
Cuban pop star.
who found the body?
Silvana and her manager.
so, no signs of a disturbance.
no blood, no cleanup, which means this isn't the primary.
the body was staged, just like that, and one of Silvana's costumes was taken off the rack and put on the victim's body.
that explains the lack of blood on the dress.
what do we got going here, bud?
blunt force trauma-- the face and most of her upper torso.
semicircular impressions all over the body.
liver temp is 90. 4.
she died about six hours ago.
I'll get the gurney.
so our killer brings her here, stages the body...
nobody even notices?
she was rehearsing for a couple of hours onstage.
the music's loud, people are distracted.
how many ways in and out of here? - Only two.
door from the stage, and there's a back door down that hallway leading to the alley.
well, that's the how; I'd like to know the why.
Silvana's sister...
...in her dress, sitting at her vanity...
...staring into her mirror.
you got something?
Yeah.
Silvana, you're next.
Silvana Cuerto isthe hottest ticket in Vegas.
next to...
rum and cigars, Silvana is Cuba's biggest export.
so, how come I've never heard of her, then?
I don't know, I mean, she's been touring Europe, now she's finally coming to the States.
didn't know you were such a big Cuban music fan.
you know, Sex Pistols, Sinatra, Silvana
I'm equal opportunity like that.
if she's so popular, why are all these people here protesting?
I'm very sorry for your loss, Ms. Cuerto.
it's like... part of me is dead.
I do have to ask you some questions. I'm sorry.
I understand.
I know that you and your manager found your sister Marta. Right?
was there anyone else backstage, anyone who didn't belong?
no, just us.
when was the last time you saw Marta?
yesterday. We had lunch, then she went shopping.
shopping?
Marta does wardrobe for the show.
she made all of my costumes.
my whole life, she's taken care of me.
and coming here, I was so scared.
but Marta gave me the strength.
she was so happy for me, like it was her up in that stage...
and I felt her with me.
did your sister mention receiving threats?
everyone loved Marta.
okay, how about you?
have you received any threats?
Silvana received threats every day, ever since we arrive in this country.
threats from whom, Mr. Ficha?
the so-called Cuban exiles who want Silvana to go home or die.
you're talking about the people outside.
that's right.
it's a long way from carrying a sign to killing someone.
I don't expect you to understand.
politics in your country is entertainment.
in Cuba, it's passion; it's blood.
these threats against Silvana--were they anonymous?
the threats, yes... the source... no.
what do you mean by that?
the leader of the exile community-- Eddie Santos
he's been following us ever since we landed
outside the hotel, outside the restaurant where we eat, - outside this club. - Why didn't you report him?
I did-- to your State Department.
obviously, your government is deaf to the concerns of the loyal Cuban citizens.
some more loyal than others.
couldn't help but notice on your passport there's an entry-- "Gobierno Cubano
my Spanish is a little rusty, but I'm pretty sure that means "Cuban government
you're not just Silvana's manager, are you?
I was assigned to accompany Silvana on her tour
Marta, too.
you're a handler.
Yeah, that makes sense.
I mean, a talent like Silvana
you're the guy assigned to make sure that she, uh... finds her way back home.
perhaps if I had been more vigilant...
Marta would still be alive.
got black streaks on the floor here.
looks like some kind of oil residue.
I've got a fiber here.
could help us find our primary.
more fibers at the base of the chair.
there's a trail heading right out of the room.
and down the hallway to the door to the alley.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
when fibers get snagged on the floor like that, it means material was dragged.
weighed down like a body in some kind of sack.
body dump.
but where did the killer stash the sack?
what are the odds?
so much for security at your club, Mr. Mejia.
in fact, the only functioning camera in this entire club that's working is aimed at the cash register behind the bar.
kind of sums up your priorities, don't you think?
you're out of line.
I don't think so.
given what I saw outside, you have no excuse for not providing adequate security.
I tried.
I installed these cameras this month.
I've had to fix 'em four times already.
ever since I announced that Silvana was performing at the club,
I've had acts of vandalism every night.
you're pointing a finger at the exiles?
all I'm saying is, I don't get how people who are otherwise calm and law-abiding can go crazy over ancient history, wounds that are over 50 years old.
aren't you Cuban?
Cuban-American.
my parents and I came here 20 years ago, when I was 11.
this is my country, not Cuba.
my generation-- here.
Marta's and Silvana's-- over there.
we just want to be free to live our lives, follow our dreams.
Yeah, well, somebody ended that for Marta Cuerto, and Silvana may be next, so, if this show must go on, then you have to fix these cameras.
beautiful music, Doc.
Oh, brings back memories.
have you been to Cuba?
15 years ago.
I was invited to a symposium on forensic pathology in Havana.
hmm, you must have some good stories.
actually, that's why I called you here.
but this story is far from good.
this pattern of injuries is quite specific and not new to me.
what do you mean?
injuries on the wrists indicate the victim was forcibly restrained.
ligature marks.
width suggests rope.
same ligature marks on her ankles.
slight bruising on her shoulders from a hyperextension of the muscles.
and this bruising on her abdomen says the victim was subjected to an extended period of intense pressure.
which all adds up to what?
she was hog-tied.
so you're saying systematic torture?
I met a journalist in Cuba who claimed to have been arrested by the authorities.
he described an account of torture referred to as "la silla."
which means"the chair."
according to him, it was a technique commonly employed by the Cuban police.
after a few hours, they lifted him off the floor, tied him to a chair, and beat him into submission with a pipe.
the pipe would be consistent with the semicircular gashes all over her body.
do you have anything else?
well, no obvious signs of sexual assault.
I sent the SAE kit to DNA.
but I did find this...
partially embedded in the skin of her left heel.
looks like some kind of metal.
lurk much?
you know, if you weren't my boss and dating my mother, I'd say I hate that.
well, I'm not too happy myself, Depardieu.
or I guess you're really Andie MacDowell, aren't you?
what are you talking about?
green Card, the movie.
saw it with Morgan's mother.
at least the first 15 minutes, before I got paged to an even worse crime.
right. This is about the immigration investigation?
Yes, it is.
what the hell were you thinking?
what do you mean? - You meet a woman in Italy and a week later, you're engaged?
you don't even speak the same damn language.
which has its advantages.
all right, you think this is funny?
this is Morgan's deposition... supporting your story.
I know; I didn't ask her to do that.
I'm your supervisor, David; we're family here.
you should've told me.
and you sure as hell should've told your mother-- she's beside herself.
default position.
that's not funny.
my daughter went to bat for you here.
you better not be making her a liar.
well, at least someone still has faith in me.
Oh, Lord.
family?
Yes. Um, never mind.
good news item number one: the residue Morgan and Greg found in Silvana's dressing room...
was motor oil.
which was also found on the burlap sack used to transport the body, along with flecks of dried blood matching our victim.
what else you got?
item number two:
the chip found embedded in our victim's heel is not just one metal, but four.
a metallic layer cake, if you will.
trivalent chromium, nickel, copper, flat carbon steel." Steel for the body, copper for the surface, nickel for the shine, and tri-chromium for the polish.
auto body shop.
actually, it's a chrome-plating facility.
there's only three in Vegas, one of which is only two blocks from the club.
check out the name of the owner.
face of the Cuban exiles.
good work. I'll call Brass.
doesn't look like they're open for business.
well, it looks like somebody's home.
Hey, Jim... - Yeah?
metal chips look just like the trace Doc pulled out of the victim.
Yeah.
Nick. - Yeah?
I got blood.
looks like we found our primary.
Eddie Santos, LVPD.
you going somewhere, Eddie?
we found all that stuff in your shop, Eddie, but it was a match to Marta Cuerto.
so let me guess, uh, you were headed back there to clean up when we arrested you, right?
I had nothing to do with that or killing anyone-- I was going to my office to get paperwork.
paperwork? Your last customer picked up his car at 11: 30 yesterday morning, right before you closed up the shop at noon, right?
and we know that Marta Cuerto was killed between 1: 00 p. m. and 6: 00 p. m.
and then delivered to her sister's dressing room, which is a block away from your shop.
guilty until proven innocent!
I feel I'm back in Cuba!
is that were you got those scars? In Cuba?
30 years ago, I was in a room like this, with police like you.
they beat me and threw me in la gaveta.
la gaveta. They threw you in a drawer?
ten guys in a six-by-eight prison cell filled with rats, roaches, feces,
Eddie, save the history lesson.
this isn't Havana, Cuba.
this is Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, and here we go on evidence, and we found a lot of it in your shop.
I have no reason to kill anyone.
we checked you out, Eddie-- the way you were following around Silvana, Marta, her manager
everywhere they went, there you were.
it's a free country.
right, where Silvana Cuerto can cash in. "Bringing the Benjamins back to her repressive government.
those are your words.
last I checked, I have the right to speak my mind.
Yeah, but you don't have the right to commit murder...to exact revenge on traitors who aren't loyal to your cause.
and you damn sure don't have the right to torture people the way that you were tortured.
I didn't kill anyone!
Oh, right-- you're one of those romantic revolutionaries.
we ran a rape kid on Marta.
we found semen.
we found contributions on a sofa in your shop!
if you want us to compel your DNA and match it to the DNA we found, we're happy to do that.
you want evidence?
you don't need to compel anything.
go ahead, take my DNA.
you sure DNA's not a match?
I ran it twice, then called Greg.
which is when I noticed that the result wasn't a total bust.
Eddie Santos's DNA profile showed a second-order relative match to the profile of our suspect.
Second-order, as in a half sibling?
or a grandson, maybe a nephew.
either way, our suspect is definitely a member of Eddie Santos's family.
well, sounds like you need to shake the Santos family tree, right?
or, you know, we could call our friend Donna Hoppe.
well, at this point, I may not be a genealogy Jedi, but Padewan, at least, I am.
I got this one.
Hey, Doc. You said you had some news?
an unexpected detour on the road to determining cause of death.
take a look at these internal organs.
the heart and brain look really swollen.
30% more than normal.
lungs are lined with this cherry red mucosa.
so Marta was poisoned.
what about the beating?
while poisoning appears to be the ultimate C. O.D. vital response in the wounds suggests they were simultaneous events.
so the killer poisoned her and beat her.
you were talking about Cuban police torture.
did you ever come across anything like this?
never.
and the cherry red color is indicative of cyanide, isn't it? Well, the short answer's yes.
I can't tell you how it would have gotten into her system.
didn't find any injection marks, no inhaled residue in her nasal passages.
what about her stomach contents?
already sent that off to Hodges.
Silvana's manager, Antonio, provided everybody in the band with prepaid cell phones; I pulled up every call that Marta made the day that she died.
made calls to her sister, Antonio, couple of calls to the Rumbason Club, also some fabric stores and fashion outlets.
well, that makes sense. Silvana said that Marta went shopping for wardrobe for the show.
rehearsal wasn't until 8: 00.
here are the last calls she ever made
three in a row right around 2: 30 p. m.
couple hours before she died.
no caller I. D.'s.
702 number's another prepaid cell.
202. Well, that's Washington, DC.
Yeah. - Let's do a reverse .
read my mind.
access denied.
put that together with Cuba and Washington, DC.
the plot thickens. You know, I don't want to go to that CIA place, but...
I'm kind of going to that CIA place.
want a bite?
here you go, bud.
easy, easy.
dog walker on vacation?
Yeah, stomach flu.
speaking of, is that the report on Marta Cuerto's stomach contents?
this? Uh, no.
this is personal.
okay. No problem.
if you must know, uh, it's Morgan's character reference to Immigration in support of my engagement to Elisabetta.
well, you know, I would've been happy to write you a character reference-- I mean,
I would've left out the part about your criminal record but...
well, clearly, I should've talked to you first.
congratulations, buddy.
I look forward to meeting her sometime.
an oversight I plan to correct.
hear that, Sam?
he's getting married.
so, stomach contents.
Yeah, in my office. - All right.
Sammy, I got some work to do now, boy. Stay here, I'll be right back.
based on my analysis of Marta Cuerto's stomach contents,
I know how the cyanide got into her system.
GCMS picked up linamarin, lotaustralin...
cyanogenic glucosides.
well, how the hell did they get in there?
page two. Lovely illustration.
behold the cassava leaf, which has been known to produce medicinal properties, only if processed carefully.
and if not?
uh, nasty business.
especially in the hands of our killer, who, it seems, force-fed them to Marta, knowing that the glucosides from the unprocessed leaves would react with stomach enzymesto produce hydrogen cyanide.
which is then absorbed through the stomach lininginto the bloodstream.
once in the blood, cyanide binds to hemoglobinmore strongly than oxygen, preventing the oxygen from getting to the cells.
the result-- asphyxiation.
suffocation.
and death.
heard our suspect's DNA shows he's related to Eddie Santos.
Russell said you were doing a little genealogy?
Yeah.
and this family tree has some seriously poisoned roots back in Cuba.
I accessed the Clark County Museum of Hispanic Heritage database.
I found this.
1973 Cuban Army photo. - Guy on the left
Colonel Carlos Cuerto.
Cuerto? Related to the Cuerto sisters?
grandfather, and the guy next to him
25-year-old Sergeant Eduardo Santos.
young Eddie Santos.
a year after this,
Eddie and two comrades made a crack about Colonel Cuerto's ties to the black market.
they were arrested and thrown in jail.
where they were tortured.
for six years at the hands of Colonel Cuerto himself.
this may have nothing to do with politics at all.
it's a feud between the Cuerto and Santos family.
Yeah, simmering for 40 years.
and I think I know which family member exacted revenge.
Hilda Santos, sister of Eddie Santos, emigrated from Cuba in '92, married Oscar Mejia.
they had one son together.
Estefan Mejia, owner of the Rumbason.
also...
Eddie Santos' nephew.
what do you guys want?
we just want to talk to you about your uncle, Eddie Santos.
and the vendetta your family has against the Cuertos family.
vendetta? I have no part in any vendetta.
Really?
then why don't you explain to us how we found your DNA on Marta Cuerto's body in your uncle's auto shop?
the DNA you left behind when you raped and killed her.
Mitch, call an ambulance!
I'm going with her. - Sir, I'm sorry. I can't let you in there right now.
get your hands off me. I demand to be inside with Silvana.
Mitch, I've got this.
Mr. Ficha, I'm so sorry.
let me talk to you just for a second.
Silvana's exhibiting the same signs of poisoning as Marta
Cyanide-- now, I've told the doctors, so they know what to do.
you saw the message scrawled in Silvana's dressing room.
those animals said she was next.
where were you?
we do have a suspect in custody, sir.
a little late, don't you think?
why won't you tell me what's happening with Silvana?
Why? You trying to figure out if you're on the hook for one murder or two?
What?!
your club is getting a bad rep, Estefan.
first Marta.
now your star attraction, Silvana, collapses on stage.
Yeah, at first we thought you just had lousy security, given the angry crowd outside, but now we know that the real threat was coming from inside.
coming from you.
I told you, I don't share the same beliefs as the exile community.
maybe not them, but what about your uncle?
that's a different story.
blood is thicker than politics, right?
I don't know what you're talking about.
you know exactly what we're talking about.
let me show you something.
I think you referred to this as "ancient history"
let me show you a little recent history.
I think you recognize that, don't you?
look familiar?
how'd it go down?
did your uncle watch while you raped her?
and then, you two guys, what, you tied her up, then you beat her.
and then forced cassava leaves down her throat and watched her suffocate.
no.
DNA doesn't lie, man! We know it was you!
I didn't. I couldn't hurt her.
so? It was your uncle then.
No! I mean, I don't know.
you don't know? - No, I wasn't there...when this happened.
look, my uncle tried to turn me against the Cuertos, but Silvana, Marta and I were friends.
I lived with them when I was a kid.
even when I came to this country, we stayed in touch.
when Silvana's career took off, I saw it as a chance to bring them here.
no, you saw it as an opportunity to lure the Cuerto sisters and settle an old score.
my uncle's fight is not my fight!
I couldn't hurt her!
I couldn't hurt Marta!
her and I were in love.
is that why you took her to your uncle's body shop?
that's not my idea of romance.
it was the only place near the Rumbason where we could meet... in secret.
Marta called me, and I went to her.
we made love.
I got to go. I'll see you tonight.
Marta was still alive when I left.
I swear.
what about your uncle? Where was he at?
I can't tell you.
you can't... or you won't?
是，是，是。
我很高兴。
no, Elisabetta, I'm-I'm very happy.
it-it's just that it's-it's hard.
um... difficile, uh, for me to express it... in Italian.
it's, uh... it's the language barrier and...
Elisabetta. Hello?
Hello?
sorry to interrupt.
I brought you Silvana Cuerto's stomach contents for analysis.
Aw, you shouldn't have.
so, everything okay with Elisabetta?
Yeah, uh, great.
Yeah, in-in fact, uh, she just heard from Immigration.
uh, they processed our application, and, uh, because of your help, uh, we've been approved.
Yeah. So, what... what does that mean?
well, uh, it means that we have 90 days to get married, or she gets put back on a plane home.
well, it's a good thing you live in Vegas.
you can just get hitched at a drive-thru.
well, don't take your foot off the gas.
Thanks.
look who's back.
CSI... Russell, right?
Yeah, that's right.
how are you feeling?
I don't know.
what happened?
well, we're gonna find that out.
seems somebody tried to poison you.
like they did to Marta?
Antonio told me.
well, the person who poisoned your sister forced her to ingest cassava leaves.
now, clearly, that was not the case with you, but do you remember if anyone offered you any food, or something to drink before your rehearsal?
no.
but I-I can't remember much.
okay.
what I do remember, I wish I could forget.
I was so happy to come here.
to be a star...in this country.
now, Marta...
Marta's dead.
I should never have...
please...
find who did this.
please tell me that you have something.
you know we had to let Eddie Santos go.
well, we just sprung his nephew Estefan, as well.
so I am hoping that we can tie at least one of them to Silvana's poisoning.
well, I can tell you this much.
Silvana Cuerto was poisoned with cyanide by way of unprocessed cassava leaves.
so at least our killer is consistent.
not entirely, because in Silvana's case, he changed the method of delivery.
in addition to the cassava leaves,
I found gelatin and plant polysaccharides.
which is from soluble capsules?
Yes.
so, Silvana ingested pills filled with poison.
Yes, again, but I don't think she knew that they were filled with poison.
I suspect that she thought they were filled with justicia pectoralis, which I also found in the mix.
it's an herbal remedy, primarily used for relaxation.
cubans call it tilo.
Tilo. You know it?
Yeah, I just saw it on the evidence list.
Greg found a bottle of it in Silvana's dressing room.
maybe somebody who had access-- perhaps Estefan
spiked Silvana's calm pills, tried to kill her buzz.
I'll get Greg to run the tilo.
thank you. -Pleasure.
we found in Silvana's dressing room contained ground-up cassava leaves.
source of the cyanide.
right. Lucky for Silvana, that when you put the poison in a capsule, it reduces the-the potency. All right.
and we know the print Greg assembled came back to Antonio Ficha.
so much for him being her handler.
looks like he's our killer, but I-I don't... I don't get it.
well, I may have something for you.
just got off the phone with the State Department
Cuerto sisters were seeking asylum.
that explains the phone call to... to DC.
sisters defecting, bad news for Antonio.
all right. So what are we thinking? That he killed Marta and then...
left the warning for Silvana, "You're next"?
obviously, she didn't get the message.
right. I'm on my way.
you got something? - Yeah, Antonio Ficha checked Silvana out of the hospital about a half hour ago.
where were they going?
patrol spotted them returning to their hotel.
I'm meeting Brass over at the Palermo.
Crawford. Okay I'm on my way.
guy at the front desk says Antonio and Silvana arrived about 20 minutes ago.
went straight up to the room.
were they alone? They were.
what do you mean "they were"?
a few minutes after that, another guy showed up.
his description matches Estefan Mejia.
what the hell is he doing here?
No!
LVPD!
drop the gun! Drop the gun, Antonio!
drop the gun! Show me your hands!
against the wall! Come on!
it's Estefan. He's dead.
it's okay.
everything's okay. - Antonio's crazy.
he was going to kill me. - It's all right. It's all right.
you're safe now. You're safe.
it's all over.
all right, what do you got for me, David?
broken nose, bruises.
took a few shots to the face before a single GSW to the forehead.
and there's no exit wound.
it's a large caliber, consistent with a . 45.
check this out.
it's a compound fracture of the right index finger.
that's the trigger finger.
Antonio must've wrenched the gun out of his hand.
Hey, Morgan...
...Take a look at this.
seen that before.
in Silvana's dressing room.
Yeah. Killer used the burlap sack to transport Marta's body with.
but what's it doing here?
Hey, guys, look what I found.
Antonio's bag.
Yeah.
with blood on it.
it's like a regular murder kit.
what do we have here?
I'm guessing those are cassava leaves.
it happened so fast.
Estefan pushed his way into the room.
then he and Antonio started to argue.
what were they arguing about?
he said Antonio had murdered Marta, tried to poison me and that he wouldn't let Antonio hurt me again.
what made Estefan think that Antonio was the one behind it all?
he said his uncle told him.
when Estefan pulled out a gun, I ran into the bathroom to hide.
then I heard a shot.
and I was sure he'd killed Antonio.
then the police arrived, and I saw Estefan lying on the floor.
he was just trying to protect me.
you're gonna be all right.
I think we should get you to the hospital, just to make sure.
no, I don't want to go to the hospital.
I just want to go home.
Silvana's returning to Cuba.
and so am I.
you have no right to hold me here.
I've done nothing wrong.
Antonio, we walked in on you standing over Estefan Mejia with a gun in your hand.
Yeah, man, I think the gun was still smoking.
that was in self-defense.
Silvana and I were packing our bags when...
Estefan showed up.
I tried to reason with him, but his head was filled with...
lies.
you son of a bitch! I know what you've done!
Oye, tranquilo!
you killed Marta! You poisoned Silvana!
what are you talking about?! That was your crazy uncle.
not me! I am the one protecting Silvana, and I'm taking her home.
no, you're not going anywhere!
no, no, no!
now you get the hell out of here.
No!
Estefan gave me no choice.
let's say I buy self-defense.
we still found your fingerprints on Silvana's tilo capsules.
they were filled with cyanide.
so you think I poisoned Silvana?
why would I do such a thing?
she's Cuba's gift to the world.
gift to the U. S. you mean.
she and Marta wanted to defect.
but you weren't gonna let that happen.
I don't know what you're talking about.
he's lying.
maybe.
and I don't know anything about any poisoned pills.
I gave Silvana my tilo to calm her down after Marta's death.
I guess you don't know anything about this bag.
same one with your name on it.
it also has Marta's blood on it.
and that's the same kind of rope you used to tie her up with. And the fiber is a match to the same burlap sack used to transport her to the Rumbason from Eddie Santos's auto body shop.
you've been trying to frame Eddie Santos from day one.
no. I am the one being framed here.
don't you see?
I thought justice in your country wasn't about what you believe.
it's about what you can prove.
no?
what can we prove?
we're running everything right now.
state Department's all over this.
we can't afford any mistakes.
well, neither can he.
Hey, boss.
I've got confirmation of our preliminary results.
blood on Antonio Ficha's duffel bag matches Marta Cuerto.
that's good. And the fibers that we found from the burlap sack match the burlap sack that the killer used to move the body.
also good.
the rope, the cassava leaves are all consistent.
But?
but Henry couldn't recover any DNA from the gloves.
and I found this little mystery in the duffel.
what's this?
Mouton.
lambskin. With a particular acrylic dye recipe commonly used in the restoration of classic American cars.
which you're thinking the killer used to transport the body.
Yes. And according to the fiber, we should be looking in the trunk of a 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air.
Oh. Now, that's the same car that Eddie Santos drives.
I went there, too. There's just one problem.
I processed Eddie's Chevy while he was in custody, and his car hasn't seen a carpet upgrade since 1956.
well, that's not good.
of course, Eddie has a stable of classic cars.
could be one of them.
or the car, like our killer, could've been staring us in the face the whole time.
I checked with Sunstar Auto Rental.
they said they wrote a two-day contract on this '56 Chevy for Antonio for-for your photo shoot.
but the kid behind the desk said that he was such a big fan, that when you came back to rent it for an extra day, he gave it to you for free.
off the books.
I guess...
like me, he was won over by your-your beautiful voice, your warm heart, your... trusting face.
anyway...
he said something else that was very interesting.
he said that he wasn't used to having people return vehicles cleaner than when they drove them off the lot.
I know you did it.
I know you killed your sister.
I loved my sister. - I don't doubt that.
because, in my experience, a brutal murder like Marta's can only come from deep emotions.
love turned to hate through betrayal.
you don't even know what you're talking about.
actually, I do.
let me back up a second.
Estefan brought you and your sister here, but it was Marta who contacted the State Department.
so that you could have a career in this country.
but more importantly, so she could be near Estefan.
but you wanted Estefan for yourself, didn't you?
you loved him. Ever since you were kids.
and the more you loved him, the more you hated your sister.
you're forgetting I'm the victim of Antonio's betrayal.
well, it does look like that.
because you made it look like that.
Antonio's bag, incriminating.
Antonio's tilo pills, poisoned just enough to make you sick - but not enough to kill you. - These are lies.
these are all lies!
why can't you see the truth? - You know, actually,
I-I heard the truth, Silvana.
because you've already given us your confession, haven't you?
all this time, listening to these lyrics but not really hearing them.
these words of-of love, loss, revenge...
redemption.
no matter what she's done, she still believes that her lover will forgive her.
come to rescue her.
just like you believed when you called Estefan, and begged him to come to the hotel to rescue you.
but Antonio was trying to kill me.
no, you murdered your sister, and you told Estefan that Antonio did it.
you do realize, don't you, that your lies got Estefan killed?
Marta knew how much I loved Estefan.
since we were children.
every song I wrote was about him.
she should have never come between us!
forced me to punish her for what she took from me.
I beat her. I killed her!
and I would do it again if that would bring Estefan back!
you tried to tell me that you should never have come to this country.
you're right.
unlike your song, Silvana, you'll find no redemption here.
happy birthday!
happy birthday! -- Thank you!
what's this?
I, uh... took a total shot in the dark.
please tell me I'm right?
uh, yeah, actually, you are.
well, in that case, happy birthday.
how did you know?
you seem to be celebrating.
and I noticed how you keep watching that party over there.
God. It's that obvious, huh?
two forks. -- Of course. You can't eat birthday cake alone.
all right, then, well, I guess I should blow out the candle, huh?
unless you want me to sing "Happy Birthday."
no. No, please.
hope your wish comes true. -- Thank you.
excuse me. Can we grab another bottle and an extra glass?
unless the party's over.
no. No, I'm not driving. It's a present to myself.
day at the spa, room at the hotel, dinner...
why not? Treat yourself, right? You deserve it.
thank you. You saved my night.
you were a definite upturn in my night, as well.
all right, so, where to? -- Twelve.
12 it is. 18 for me.
well, this is you -- 12.
I know.
suddenly, being alone in my hotel room doesn't sound like that much fun.
Sara? What are you doing here?
checking out. -- You spent the night?
why are you here? -- We have a body up on 18. Homicide.
Oh, I'll ride up with you. -- Just can't stay away, can you?
happy birthday, by the way.
Hey. Thought you had the day off.
I need to talk to you.
sure. Can it wait a second?
no, it can't. -- Okay.
I know him -- the victim.
what do you mean, know him? - I was in his room last night.
that room? The one with the body?
I was having dinner downstairs, he came up to my table,
I ended up in his room. I was there an hour, maybe a little more.
nothing happened.
you need to sit down with a detective, and give him a statement, tell him everything. Every detail.
Taylor Wynard. Won't be going back home to Carson City.
I count seven stab wounds, but, uh, no defensive wounds.
so he didn't put up a fight, huh?
maybe the first penetration hit a vital, took all the fight out of him.
which would mean the next six was somebody working out some serious issues.
someone he knew, maybe. He had company.
lipstick says a lady.
well, I'll scan these fingerprints, bounce 'em back to Mandy, see if anything pops.
Hey, what steak dinner doesn't come with a steak knife?
knife's missing? -- Could be the murder weapon.
weapon of opportunity. Means this wasn't necessarily premeditated.
guys... we got a problem.
Sara -- prints on the wine glass belong to Sara.
say what? -- That's right.
Sara just told me that she was here last night, in this room.
that's all I know right now. But it doesn't change anything.
we still work the evidence like we always do.
we left the restaurant and went up to the room around 10: 00.
I was probably there an hour.
we sat and talked. That was it.
are you sure about that? Your fingerprint was on a wine glass.
uh, it was about the third bottle, by my count.
it was my birthday.
so you were up in his room for an hour, and then, the night ended?
Why? I mean, what happened? -- Nothing happened.
I got a text, uh, from someone wishing me a happy birthday.
someone?
the text was from Gil Grissom. Uh, that's your husband, right?
you already checked my phone records?
so you got a text from your husband, then you ended the night abruptly.
now, your date... -- Hey, he was not my date.
the guy... how did he react? Was he angry?
why would he be angry?
you're in his hotel room. There's been a lot of drinking.
he has to be thinking, you know, this is headed to bed.
I don't know what he was thinking.
but I went back to my room, alone.
okay, well, according to the keycard reader on your door, that was at 11: 15.
that sound about right? -- Yeah.
tell me about the phone call at midnight. -- What phone call?
you called the victim at 12: 04. Your cell to his.
the call lasted for eight minutes.
no... no, I didn't.
I checked the phone records... remember?
so, what was she doing here, anyways? It-it doesn't even make sense.
I don't even really think we should talk about it.
but I rode up in the elevator with her, and she didn't say anything.
Greg, I'm serious. I really don't want to talk about it.
all right? Let's just try and do our job.
Hey, come check this out.
that's Sara's. I recognize it.
after the phone call that never happened, what did you do?
I didn't do anything. I was asleep.
I've been having a little trouble at night, so my doctor prescribed some pills.
you took a sleeping pill? On top of all that alcohol?
Yeah, I did.
the key card reader on your door said you reentered your room at 2: 49 a. m.
Crawford, that's impossible. I never left my room.
do you want to check the log for yourself?
you see my problem?
it's your whereabouts from midnight to 3: 00 a. m.
well, this isn't looking good. Found damp towels in the bathroom.
hair in the drain is definitely not the victim's, but the length and color are consistent with Sara's.
okay, you want to process the bed, or you want me to do it?
I'll do it.
sheets are gone.
Greg, someone removed the evidence.
just a warning.
it's been a while since I've stuck someone.
Hodges is the expert.
I don't think you want to be around Hodges and a sharp object right now.
how come? He thinks I cheated on Grissom.
might as well have cheated on God.
in Hodges' eyes, you pretty much did.
so, that's the general consensus around here, that I cheated on my husband?
you know, I never met Grissom. He was gone before I came.
but the fact that I've never seen him around... I understand.
Morgan, nothing happened. -- Okay.
point is, I wouldn't judge you if something did.
once we run a tox screen, we can extrapolate back to establish last night's levels.
I figured he'd have to be really good-looking to get Sara's interest.
do you mind? You're talking about people we know.
are we Team Grissom or are we Team Sara?
which one are we protecting?
I see no reason why we can't protect both.
clearly, they're going through tough times.
we should be respectful of that.
I wasn't not being respectful.
it just seems like people here are a little more upset about Sara's possible infidelity than the fact that she is a suspect in a homicide.
is that the murder weapon?
I hope you can tell me. It's from the hotel.
they've got hundreds just like it
but there was one missing from the room service cart in the victim's room.
blade length looks to be about right.
handle would be consistent with the hilt marks on the victim.
I'm as certain as I can be without having the actual weapon in my hand.
well, we will try and get that for you.
do not come in here.
as far as this lab is concerned, you do not exist.
look, I know you're angry, but I...
oddly enough, this is not a matter of my feelings.
it's purely practical.
I've just spent the last three hours scrubbing any and all hint of you from this lab, so as to eliminate the possibility of contaminating any evidence.
you enter here, I have to begin all over again.
so you're not mad at me.
I didn't say that -- I merely said that's not why I barred you from my lab.
okay, well, you know, I actually came here to tell you what happened.
and taint my objectivity?
let's let the evidence speak for itself, shall we?
Hey. How you holding up?
I'm not sure. I-I've never been in this situation before. How can you tell?
Yeah, well, don't let Hodges be the determining factor.
do you think Nick and Greg are back yet?
I-I feel like I really need to talk to them.
Sara, go home. You need some distance.
I should be here; I need to help.
you can't; you know that. Just get out of here.
go home, take a bath, do something to take care of yourself.
really, this is the last place you should be.
I-I... I don't know how it got there.
you know, I wanted a glass of water, and I noticed that the dishwasher was running, so I opened it...
so it was running when you got home.
maybe. I wasn't paying attention. Nick, somebody is screwing with me.
who? -- I have no idea.
I checked the entire house. No sign of forced entry.
well, who else has a key or knows your alarm code?
you guys, Grissom, that's it. Look, somebody was here.
I mean, it was probably the same person that killed Taylor Wynard.
if that's true, I'm sure we'll find evidence of it.
what do you mean,"if that's true"?
relax, okay? We're on your side here.
but you also need to be on our side.
remember how we said we're a family?
that means that we have to start telling each other the truth.
what are you talking about?
found this in your bedroom. -- What is it?
photos.
so this is you and Taylor Wynard, right?
I'm having trouble with you lying to me like this, Sara.
I didn't lie to you. It was... an omission.
you can spin it any way you want, I still got a problem with it.
Yeah, but this proves what I've been talking about.
okay? Someone else is behind this.
Sara... you knew the victim. You know how bad this looks.
at the time, I didn't think it was relevant to what happened at the hotel.
well, when did you meet him? When was this?
two weeks ago, it was the first and only time that I saw him, and when he came to my table last night, it was a complete surprise.
what's going on?
come on. Pills, alcohol -- this is not you.
Yeah, according to the tox report, ten hours after the fact, your blood alcohol level was still0.03.
a-and your sleeping pills, the zolpidem, point-nine milligrams a liter.
that's impossible. Not point-nine.
I-I took a single five-milligram sleeping pill
there's no way that it could metabolize for ten hours and still be that high.
that's not the point. It's your behavior that's worrying me.
I mean, you lied to me, you lied to him.
and I know it's not my place to comment on your personal life, but...
you mean my cheating on my husband?
truth is, he's not my husband anymore.
Why? What happened?
ask him -- I'm sure he had my best interests in mind.
so...
Yeah, I... I've been struggling a little bit.
all right, well, if anything changes, I'd appreciate a call. Thanks.
no sign of the missing bed sheets.
they were probably thrown in the hotel laundry, in which case, they're as good as gone.
well, if this is the murder weapon, there's no way to know for sure.
pheno came back negative. There's no blood, no tissue... nothing.
could have all been washed away. -- Yeah.
well, I guess we can say that it's consistent with the murder weapon, and that it was found in Sara's house.
well, she didn't kill anybody. -- It's no crime to not want to be lonely.
I just finished processing the hair from the victim's shower drain.
it's a positive match for Sara's.
okay, so she showered. Why lie about it?
all right, would you still think it was a lie if she didn't remember the shower?
Sara had a considerable level of zolpidem in her system
a sleep drug that is associated with all sorts of bizarre sleepwalking behaviors.
yeah -- sleep-eating, sleep-driving...
almost always, the subject doesn't remember the event afterwards.
okay, so you're suggesting that Sara sleep-showered and doesn't remember?
I am suggesting that if that's the case, we have to consider any other sleep-acts she might have been capable of.
murder -- certainly a possibility.
incidentally, don't you think that one of us should call Grissom?
no. One of us should not call Grissom.
I wish you would've said something about you and Grissom splitting up.
he's so revered around here, there's no way that I don't come out looking like the bad guy.
come on, I would've drank with you.
that's my necklace. Why is my necklace on the monitor?
Sara... -- Nick, d-did you find that necklace in the hotel room?
Sara, you shouldn't be seeing that.
Nick, listen to me, okay?
I wasn't wearing that necklace last night. That necklace was at my home in my bedroom.
you heard what Russell just said -- now, come on.
just tell me -- did you find that necklace in the hotel room?
Yes. Now, come on, let's go. Come on.
ronald Basderic.
been terrorizing Edie for six months.
I tried to help her get a restraining order, but the judge denied it.
Edie, is that creep still stalking you?
you terrorized her. You kept her awake at night.
she was afraid to walk home.
it's because of you that she stayed, and now she's dead!
I know it's you, Ronald.
you wanted me to know, right? That's why you left the necklace?
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
the necklace that Edie gave me.
because I helped her when she wanted a restraining order against you.
you watched every move she made back then.
I'm sure you were stalking her when she bought it, right?
you really don't look well, Sara.
I wonder if you're not experiencing an unusual amount of stress lately.
I'm worried about you.
you killed a man, Ronald.
Why? Why did you do that? Because I helped Edie?
because I... because I stood up to you?
but you were wrong about me then, Sara.
what makes you think you're not wrong about me now?
you've been following me; you've been stalking me.
you took those pictures.
you somehow arranged for Taylor to be at the hotel.
and did I somehow make you go up to his room?
did I force your infidelity on you?
stay away from me.
speaking of which, have you called your husband?
have you told him about the tough day you're having?
tell you what, let's do it together.
I have his number right here on speed dial.
you're not gonna walk away this time, Ronald.
that's a promise.
am I out of my mind, or are you hiding evidence from me?
well, we're definitely not hiding evidence from you, so it must be that other thing you just said.
Yeah, I just found out that you've recovered her hair in his shower drain.
which we only just confirmed for ourselves. And we told you.
what about the knife? She had the murder weapon in her home.
we don't know that's the murder weapon.
I know this detective badge may be new, but I've been a cop long enough to know how to read between the lines.
that's the difference between what you do and what I do.
I don't read between the lines -- I stay with the evidence.
and right now, there's no evidence that says that Sara killed Taylor Wynard, only that she was in his room.
in his room, having an illicit affair...
under the influence of alcohol and prescription drugs, lying about her activities.
look, there you go, between the lines again.
look, I am not gunning for Sara. I do not want a CSI to be guilty.
but I want to try to protect the rest of you guys as well.
and I keep thinking, if this were anyone else, we would've made the arrest by now.
it's Sidle. I told the la...
S-I-D-L-E. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I need the phone records for Ronald Basderic.
no, you see, I don't have the warrant, but if you get me his phone records,
I will get you an administrative subpoena as soon as I'm back in the office.
how about that?
I have to call you back.
Akers. -- Uh, you need to come with me, Sara.
what's going on?
just... grab whatever you need, please, and come along.
what are you gonna do? Any possibility you're overreacting?
she was waiting for me. She stalked me.
she came to my work. Just...
there he is. Crawford. Where is she?
you processed her?!
I had to. She got herself on camera this time.
Greg, I-I never touched him. He's setting me up
he set me up at the hotel, and he's setting me up now.
why were you even there?
Russell tells you to go home and you go to Basderic's workplace?
I know. I-I, I screwed up, okay? -- Yeah.
but I'm telling you that Basderic is the one behind this, okay?
he left Edie's necklace because he wanted me to know that it was him.
Where's the rest of it?
that's all there is. There's only the one camera.
but, Sara, the D. A. has more than enough to charge you with.
you were clearly the aggressor here.
no. Look at that!
no, he knew exactly where to stand for the camera.
He-he... he lured me to that spot.
the only physical contact that I had with Basderic is on that video.
then how did he get those injuries?
Greg, how long have you known me?
you know I didn't do this.
she's unstable.
I can't be the only one who sees that.
and yet she's permitted to carry a gun and a badge.
does that seem wise?
before today, when was the last time you saw CSI Sidle?
not since the last time she falsely accused me of murder.
the massacre at Frank's Diner.
where I lost my Edie.
is that what she did today? Did she accuse you of murder?
Yes. Someone at a hotel.
to be honest, I didn't follow everything she said.
she seemed disoriented and confused.
and what about right before the altercation?
do you remember what was said exactly?
are you asking if I provoked her? Is that her defense?
that this is my fault somehow?
I asked her to leave me alone. She persisted.
feeling threatened, I pulled out my phone and called 911.
that's when she attacked me.
Hey. How's she doing?
honestly, I'm a little worried.
she's got to be struggling over this breakup with Grissom and just not talking about it, you know?
feeling isolated from the rest of us.
Yeah, so she goes and she beats the crap out of Basderic?
well, she says she didn't do it.
her clothes are helping her case.
I just examined them
there is no hint of trace or any transfer evidence.
well, there you go. After the beating Basderic took, that would be impossible.
Yeah, which means Basderic is lying. -- He probably beat himself up.
you know, Sara thinks that Basderic committed the hotel murder;
that the whole thing is an elaborate setup aimed at her.
let's start talking about what that would take.
if Basderic wanted to pull this off
kill Taylor Wynard and frame Sara, what would that require?
you would have to know that Sara was gonna be at the hotel.
well, that wouldn't be that hard to do.
she made the reservations online a couple of weeks ago.
you just got to hack into her e-mail.
okay. What else?
you'd have to be able to get in and out of her house, and her hotel room, while she was still in there.
and... he would have to arrange for the victim to be at that hotel as well.
all right, assuming that Basderic is the one who took those photos, he knew about their previous encounter.
I mean, it's been four months since Frank's Diner
he's wanted to get back at her ever since.
and who better than a crazed and obsessive sociopath to do it?
he set her up. There's got to be evidence of it.
Yeah, we just have to find it.
thank you... for whatever strings you pulled to get me out of here.
wasn't me. Thank Basderic.
he's not pursuing charges. He does have this for you, though.
restraining order. You're kidding me.
Sara, you're out. That's a gift.
now just... take it and stay away from him.
gun, I keep.
you're on leave until the department can figure out what to do with you.
and, Sara, next time you're struggling with something, anything, come talk to me.
it's important for both of us you know you can do that.
sorry, look, I-I got a bunch of messages here from the care facility that looks after my mother.
in San Francisco?
no, no, I moved her down here about six months ago.
although I don't see her any more often than I did when she was up north.
Oh, great -- she got her hands on a bottle of alcohol.
she's in the hospital. Just what I needed.
Hi, uh, I'm looking for Laura Sidle. Thanks.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, sweetie. I'm so s-sorry.
mom, you can't be drinking, you know that.
you know what happens when you start. You can't drink like that.
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.
I know. I know you are.
I pray and pray for you.
all the time, so that you wouldn't turn out like me.
mom, I'm fine, okay?
just-just rest. Just-just try to rest right now.
but what about the man? -- What man?
at the hotel.
you killed him. You stabbed him.
just like I stabbed your father.
who told you that? Who did you talk to?
your friend. Ronald.
he's very nice. So sweet.
what's up?
hotels have a device that allows them to override the keycard slot, and according to the log, someone did exactly that and entered Sara's room just before midnight.
which means the killer could have taken her phone, and would explain the midnight call she said she never made.
then it would let the killer steal the key to re-enter the room later.
he's taking a big risk though, with her asleep.
I mean, what if she woke up?
well, if she did, she has insomnia on a level the world has never seen.
I tested Sara's sleeping pills. They had been tampered with.
Super-sized, if you will.
they contained more than double the prescribed dosage.
safe to say, she was knocked out.
so Sara was set up.
now we just got to prove that it was Basderic.
Hey, take a look at this.
these are the shower drain covers from both Sara and the victim's rooms.
the micro-scratches on the drain covers don't line up with the surrounding rings.
but... when I swap them...
look.
a perfect match.
that's how Sara's hair got in the victim's room.
someone swapped the drain covers.
all right, my turn.
so, these are video stills from hotel surveillance the night of the murder.
all right, what am I looking for?
this guy. Right here.
now, he seems to be in all the right places at all the right times.
yeah... but with that hat and those glasses, it's hard to say.
it could be anybody.
true. But check this out.
here's Basderic leaving work, the same day.
now, look at the shoes. Atlantic Oxfords.
and notice the pants?
there's a coffee stain or something right there.
now, if we compare the two...
same stain, same clothes... same guy. Nice.
which means now we can put Basderic in the hotel the night of the murder.
question is, what does he really want?
I mean, why would he plan it out the way he did?
well, he's obsessed with Sara
he wants to get back at her for belittling him for stalking Edie.
okay, but what's his endgame?
if he just wants to frame Sara for murder, he could've left the bloody knife at her house
then she really would've been screwed.
instead, he washes it off. Why?
same reason he didn't press charges for the assault.
he doesn't want her locked up; he wants her out.
which means he's not done with her.
and I think I know why.
Russell, during the Frank Steiner murder
Sara and I turned up a previous court case that involved Basderic.
I remember, civil suit
he collected damages after somebody assaulted him, right?
the point is that Basderic drew the guy in.
he harassed and stalked his wife until the guy finally came after him.
then Basderic shot him in self-defense.
now, Sara already has the restraining order against her.
and she's on record for having assaulted the guy.
so if she goes after him, he could legally shoot her and get away with it.
that is the revenge that he's after.
he doesn't want to frame her, he wants to kill her.
Where's Sara now? -- I don't know. She won't answer her phone.
another ambush by Las Vegas's finest?
no, we just want to have a friendly conversation, Ronald.
is that a weapon you're carrying?
the gun is registered. I have a permit to carry it.
I'm gonna have to relieve you of it anyway.
just... while we're talking.
make sure nothing goes sideways, nobody gets hurt.
we know you were at the hotel.
well, that's awfully vague.
am I supposed to know what you're talking about?
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
last night, when you stabbed Taylor Wynard to death.
and you have evidence of this?
or am I supposed to just... offer up a confession?
is that why you're here?
no. I'm here to give you a warning.
if you hurt Sara... -- She attacked me.
I'm the one who has to be worried.
maybe we should take you in. We could hold you for your own protection.
that won't be necessary.
next time-- should there be a next time
I'll be ready.
next time's with me.
I'm free to go, am I not? -- Nick...
I won't let you hurt her.
can I have my gun, please?
you be careful with that.
leave the light off.
what do you want?
what do I want? I'm gonna stop you.
I didn't want to do this. I didn't want to come here.
but you made me, Ronald.
you discredit me at my job, you get me arrested, you go after my mother?!
you don't really think you can get away with this.
I don't really care.
somebody needs to stop you.
you have ruined so many lives.
and now I'm gonna ruin yours.
don't bother.
I removed the firing pin when I was in your house.
don't worry, I'll put it back. After.
this is exactly what you wanted, isn't it?
you planned all of this right down to this minute right here.
well, at least now you can appreciate what I went through.
the months of planning, the attention to detail.
did you even notice? Seven stab wounds.
I stabbed him seven times, just like your mother stabbed your father.
you're sick, Ronald.
I watched you, Sara. I read your e-mails.
I witnessed your adolescent groping outside the bar.
you know, I had to pay Taylor to meet you at the hotel?
I told him we were friends, that I didn't want you to spend your birthday by yourself.
I even sprung for the dessert.
and now I get to kill you.
just do it already.
you're done, Ronald. This time for real.
what did I tell you, Ronald?
I said I won't let you hurt her.
blanks.
you switched my ammo. -- No, he did.
must be yours. Guess I, uh, got mixed up somehow.
there you go. Yeah.
right. Come on.
No! I do not need that damn chair.
I can walk just fine.
well, I know, Mom, but the hospital has rules.
since when were you one to follow rules?
what was it you used to tell me?
if, um... somebody wants to do something nice for you, why get in their way?
I did say that, didn't I?
all the time. You were full of good advice.
too bad I didn't take any of it myself, right?
there are so many things I wish...
I had done differently.
and most of them, I... I can't change now.
but one thing I... would like to try and change...
is the way things are between us.
maybe we could... visit once in a while.
I just want you to be okay.
I'm fine. I'm great.
I think people would understand if... you want to take some time off.
no, I'd rather get right back in.
you sure?
where else would I want to be?
okay.
little late for an intervention, don't you think?
well, I just... I just thought... -- We.
we... just thought that it might be a... good idea to talk.
or listen. Whatever you prefer.
have a seat.
I didn't mean to shut you guys out.
I didn't tell you about Grissom and me because I didn't believe it myself.
you know, we made that dinner reservation together before we split up, and...
as I sat there alone in the restaurant...
...I honestly expected him to show up.
I think that we all like the idea...
of you two being together.
and maybe it was because that was our way of-of hanging on to him just a little bit, you know.
but if it's over... it's over.
Hey, you can't sit around waiting forever.
and you'll always have us.
like it or not.
thank you.
thank you for not giving up on me.
you were on fire tonight.
Oh... oh, yes. And burnt.
Oh, come on!
okay, sailor... I think you got it from here.
what are you talking about? - It's late.
you're not coming up?
I got to go. I'm sorry.
Aw, come on.
there's always next year.
doesn't mean it's gonna be a good year.
they're always more beautiful... when they dump you.
good night, Brad.
help me...
what do we got?
Peter Coe, professional poker player.
lost big tonight in the Classic. Lost even more on the elevator.
"Classic"?
Palermo Poker Classic.
it's like the Vegas Super Bowl. It's been all over the TV.
the final pot's eight million clams.
Damn! That's a lot of clams.
surveillance? - Nope.
guy at the front desk says Coe came in with a pretty woman in a purple dress.
she left before he got on the elevator.
gather not his wife.
no. Single. Ladies' man.
brass is trying to track down the mystery woman.
other witnesses?
guy got off the elevator as Coe was getting on;
woman on the second floor rang the elevator, dying guy answered.
Coe rode up alone?
Yeah. Go figure.
Hey, bud, elevator saying anything to you?
well, it's saying that our victim didn't suffer for too long.
Spirting pattern suggests the killer cut an artery.
wow, look at that. Blood travels all the way to the gap.
question is, who caused the bloodshed?
Yeah. And how'd the suspect get in?
and out again, in seconds.
after you.
no dust disturbance, and no signs of hand or footprints.
that's the only other way in.
whoever did this was quick, agile.
Ah, but no scuff marks on the wall.
well, we're missing something.
I checked Coe's wallet; nothing is missing. Motive wasn't robbery.
how does a guy taking a ten-second elevator ride, alone, get his throat cut?
guess we're just gonna have to take a ride ourselves and find out.
Peter Coe. C. O.D. is exsanguination due to a severed jugular carotid complex.
that's a pretty clean slice. Razor?
it could be. I swabbed the wound.
maybe we'll find trace of the blade alloy.
speaking of alloys, our victim was wearing this metal bracelet.
ppc 1997 Champion.
Palermo Poker Classic. Same tournament he lost at last night.
in '97, he won the main event-- a million bucks. I looked it up.
morgan looked up Coe's financial history. The guy was completely broke.
I think I can tell you what he spent his million on-- his face.
he's had extensive dermal filling of the forehead, massive injections of Botox.
I also found numerous scalpel scars along his lower eyelid, ear and mouth.
so our man was vain.
our man was trying to win again.
he had a plastic surgery procedure called Poker Lift.
even the best poker players have tells.
Pokertox uses an endoscope to remove all those twitches, squints and ticks, creating the perfect poker face.
you've seen this before?
twice on my table this year.
Vegas.
this didn't help his game, either.
powdery substance on his shirt.
cocaine? - Could be.
all right, I'll rush it up to Hodges.
Hey, there she is. How you doing, Sarah?
good.
everything cool?
all good.
right on.
I, uh, got a name for us. Trent Aldridge. He's local.
checked in alone at midnight.
he may have checked in alone, but he definitely had some company in here.
wrists and ankles are bound to the bedposts.
dinner with a side of S&M?
his face looks all contorted, like he was gasping for air.
liver temp was 94.1, so he's been dead about three hours.
Hey, man, is there something in his mouth?
his throat looks obstructed. Check that out.
Yeah. Asphyxiation.
could be our C. O.D.
eh, it's loose.
could come out in transport; I'd better grab it now.
Yeah, man, get it out of there.
what the hell is that, a piece of meat?
looks like a piece of raw meat.
maybe it was part of the sex games-- servant behaves, gets a treat.
here you go, baby.
Oh, 50 Shades of Gross.
it's kind of hard to scream the safe word when you're choking to death.
you shouldn't have. - Oh, I didn't.
the trace on our elevator victim's shirt was not cocaine, it was pollen.
from a white lily. Which tells us...?
we were looking for Coe's mystery woman.
well, he was coming from a poker tournament, so I figured that she was a player as well.
good theory. - It's a great theory.
it turns out that she's the only woman left in the tournament.
they gave her an award for it-- hence, the flower.
last Woman Standing.
mildly condescending. - Yeah, really.
the desk guy at Peter Coe's condo I. D.'d her as Ava Rendell.
she has her own Web site. She gives lessons, sells T-shirts.
Hotpokerbabe. com. - Classy.
she's actually a Harvard Business School grad.
guess she knows what sells.
poker Babe is in the finals, playing as we speak.
the key to poker is finding out your opponent's tells, and not giving away yours.
whether I'm bluffing or not, I'm always gonna look my opponent in the eye and say...
I raise.
I'm all in.
$8 million. This is it.
get ready to clean those glasses, Billy.
she's got a straight. He's toast.
he had a heart flush!
last woman standing falls.
miss Rendell, you've been identified as the last person to see Peter Coe alive.
Yeah, I was... I was with Pete.
I still can't believe this happened. You said it was a mugging?
we haven't made any determinations.
you have a good poker face.
so, did you see anything suspicious in the lobby?
it was empty; just a front desk guy.
we know that Pete was... let's just say, low on cash.
he was in debt to half the town.
so do you know anyone who... might have wanted to come collect?
no... no, I was just there to see him home safe.
how ironic is that.
so you two weren't an item? - God, no.
no, Pete was like an uncle to me.
he was a regular at my dad's poker table.
my dad was a dealer at the Palermo for 30 years.
gambling's in your blood.
Yep. Police work in yours?
my dad's a CSI.
well, he must be proud.
although I imagine it's just as much of a boys' club as poker.
not quite.
so, did Pete get along with all of the other players?
Pete was a legend. Loved.
he had his problems, but he didn't deserve this.
well, thank you for your time.
tough loss today.
I should've known when he dogged it on the turn that he had a flush.
should've seen it coming. Slow-played me.
our S&M victim's room at the Palermo was wiped down, but I found the room service guy.
our dominatrix left him a tip.
did he give you a description?
he never saw her. She was in the bathroom.
she just put her hand out the door and gave him a hundred-dollar poker chip.
maybe we'll get a print. - Okay. Thank you.
what do we got on our elevator victim, anything?
I ran trace on the neck wound. I didn't find any metal alloy.
I found cellulose acetate.
we're looking for a plastic knife?
or something less... picnic-y?
okay. Well, I guess you just round up the usual plastic instruments of death and see if we can get a match.
Really? You think a plastic boomerang is our murder weapon?
no. We're looking for cellulose acetate.
the boomerang gave us trace of polypropylene. Not a match.
ceramic knife. Zirconium dioxide.
not a match.
plastic plates.
Acrylonitrite butadiene styrene.
ditto.
rulers... - Okay, I got it.
you struck out, and you lost your mind in the process.
struck out? On the contrary.
you mean you found something? - I believe so.
and I arrived at the conclusion by venturing outside the box-- literally.
walk with me.
I think we've been looking at our elevator murder the wrong way -
we assume that the killer broke in, most likely through the ceiling hatch.
it's the only way in.
is it?
a locked room has to be open at some point.
Yeah, when the-the door's open. - Exactly.
which is why I think our killer did the deed before the locked room became locked.
no, but witnesses said that no one got on the elevator with Coe.
Precisamente.
the killer might not have gotten onto the elevator, but I think that the murder weapon did.
abracadabra. - What are you doing?
a plastic-coated playing card explains all.
in the right hands, a playing card is a lethal weapon.
thrown up to 80 miles per hour.
I once watched a magician slice a carrot in half with one.
so you're suggesting that our killer threw a playing card like a ninja star.
and that's how he killed our victim.
are you nuts? Th-That's absolutely absurd.
well, that's what the evidence suggests.
let's go back to that night, shall we?
I'm the killer. I've sneaked into Peter Coe's apartment.
there's always next year.
doesn't mean it's gonna be a good year.
good night, Brad.
Coe gets shot down. Ava splits.
I step into a side hallway, so that the front desk guy can't see me.
I watch Coe walk to the elevator.
I wait for him to get on.
make sure the coast is clear.
take aim, and just before the doors close, fire.
a playing card would explain how our murder weapon disappeared.
thin enough... - To fall through the gap.
I measured-- gap is only ten millimeters wide.
playing card? Less than one millimeter.
it's plenty of room.
it's a cool theory.
you definitely ventured outside the box. Possibly to another planet.
but can you prove it?
I sent Henry to the primary to see if he could collect a card from the elevator shaft floor.
Oh, how did Henry feel about that? - He was very happy for the opportunity.
I just got back. - Okay, I did not plan that.
any luck?
I admit. I was a skeptic. But...
please don't say "abracadabra.
okay. Found it in the elevator shaft.
you have got to be kidding me.
I pheno-ed it. Positive for blood.
I'll say it. - Abracadabra?
no. We found our murder weapon.
let me go! Please, no!
let me go! Please!
be still.
no, let me go! Please!
do you think this is funny?
it tickles.
lights! It tickles?
I just slit your throat!
you split it ten times already today, Jimmy.
how good do you want it?
good is for gillygaupus and balloon acts. I need perfection!
and I need a break.
come back scared. With jectigation.
Carl! Who let these plebs in?
I told you, no visitors, no exceptions!
James Nefarro, Las Vegas Police.
I prefer "Dr. Jimmy," actually.
okay-- Dr. Jimmy. We need to talk.
so, some friends of mine at the Palermo Poker Tournament told me that, uh...
that you staked Peter Coe ten grand to play.
how much did you get back?
not one centime. Especially now he's met with bangstry.
whatever that means.
where were you last night?
Why? You think I had something to do with Peter's untimely shuffle off this mortal coil?
the murder weapon pretty much puts you at the top of the list.
what, is this real?
it's not a trick.
so, where were you?
I was here. Rehearsing, wasn't I?
and someone can verify that? - No, I was alone.
come on, you can do better than that, Jimmy.
Peter Coe was a mate.
we played together-- Texas Hold 'Em before it was spoiled by frat boys and gongoozlers.
I'd never hurt him.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a look at your playing cards.
Ah, I see. Well... a prestidigitator never reveals his secrets.
okay. So, how about...
I reveal... a search warrant? Ta-da.
what else you got then? - Cuff him.
you're under arrest for obstruction of justice, Dr. Jimmy.
so, they've got you covering autopsy today.
mm, everybody's out in the field. You're stuck with me.
have you I. D.'d the mystery meat?
according to Hodges, the meat inside our S&M victim's throat is a...raw chicken heart.
that is not your usual room service order.
so far, I found three chicken hearts in the stomach and two in a row in the trachea.
think he was trying to swallow but couldn't get 'em down.
so he suffered.
well, I think the suffering was intentional.
I see cuts and abrasions along the trachea, there and there.
what would cause that?
ring-shaped injury on the epiglottis, hypothyroid and the upper trachea
I'd say a funnel of some kind.
so somebody forced a funnel down his throat.
this is a homicide. - Yeah. By seven hearts.
Okay...seven... hearts, as in seven of hearts.
you mean like a playing card.
Yeah. We just found the ace of spades.
this can't be a coincidence.
sheriff acceptance letter. You still haven't signed it.
I wanted your thoughts.
they would be lucky to have you. There is no one more qualified.
sheriff's Office, it's political. It... supervisory.
again, no one more qualified.
I mean, you ran the number one crime lab in the country.
Yeah, and I was a demanding, manipulative... piece of garbage.
you don't have to be that person again.
people can change for the better, but who says they can't change back?
I do.
still... why take the risk?
Hey, I mean...I took a risk. Coming here.
I had so much anger a-and rage toward you; it fueled me, but I... now...
older and wiser, huh?
I'm not that much older.
but a lot wiser.
I'm not going anywhere, Dad. No matter what.
Finn's theory about the seven of hearts wasn't so crazy.
Why? What do you got?
well, we already know that the ace of spades was used to slash Coe's throat in the elevator.
there was a second contribution on that same playing card, and it ain't human.
chicken blood?
so... whoever handled the chicken hearts also handled the playing card.
after the suspect choked Aldridge with the chicken hearts, the trace on his fingers was transferred to the ace used to slash Coe's throat.
two victims, same killer.
according to his brother, Aldridge has a regular high-stakes poker game every Friday downtown.
okay... both our victims-- white males, early 50s, poker players.
and we have a kill signature that's suggestive of a playing card.
are you thinking serial?
I think we better check old cases, see if any fit the profile.
if this guy's playing a full hand, we're gonna see more bodies.
ed Ficelli, 53. Ex-pit boss at the Palermo.
OD'd two months ago.
in the poker world like our other victims.
Yeah, tox results showed lethal amounts of heroin in his system, but check this out.
old track marks running along his favorite vein.
these last marks break the pattern, don't they?
Yeah, and those two hit musculature, which is not a place to shoot up.
Yeah, a waste of perfectly good heroin.
so I pulled the evidence, and I retested the heroin.
it was laced with the Trifolium species of clover.
Meaning? - He was poisoned.
trifolium contains lupines that cause respiratory failure.
you know, clovers are also known as clubs. - Yeah.
this could be a bit of a long shot, but... what the heck.
well, I'll be damned.
they line up. Four of clubs.
all right, so we have the ace of spades in the elevator to Peter Coe.
the seven of hearts at the hotel, Trent Aldridge.
assuming we're right, four of clubs to Ed Ficelli.
now, y-you've been in this town for a while. Do these cards mean anything in poker?
Yeah, it's lousy-- off suit, no pairs, no straight potential.
the killer's dealing a bad hand.
Hey, looks like we caught a break.
the poker chip that our dominatrix gave the room service guy-- prints came back to Ava Rendell.
our last woman standing.
that puts her in the room with Aldridge the night he died, right?
brass is trying to track her down.
something's not right. A little too convenient.
you think she's being set up?
this killer is so methodical.
speaking to us with cards. Never leaving any fingerprints.
brass just found Ava.
she checked in at nine.
she used to give private poker lessons.
any surveillance? - Not yet.
you okay?
until we get this killer to fold... No.
who is this discerped lass?
"Discerped lass"?
well, you know... people usually look at a picture like that, they... they show something.
I'm not most people, am I? - No.
what can you tell us about her?
well, she seems to be missing a body, doesn't she?
because you removed it from her head.
why would I do that?
cause you like to shock your audience. You're a magician.
a magician... is an actor playing the role of a magician.
may I humbly suggest whoever did that...isn't playing.
Ah, my counselor, at last.
you finished with your flambuginous accusations, or am I to be released?
don't disappear, Copperfield.
the wound's a combination of sharp-force injury and blunt-force trauma.
the absence of multiple tool marks suggests one chop.
so it was an unusual weapon.
I never thought about it before, but both the jack and the king are holding weapons.
king of hearts. Suicide king.
Yeah, it looks like he's stabbing himself with his own sword.
what if the killer used a weapon from a playing card?
Yeah, the king and the jack are ready to fight. He's got an axe.
king of diamonds could be our man.
I found rust-like trace in the wound.
edges are sharp and exhibit a rim of abrasion, probably from the blunt nature of the blade used.
well, you know something, I-I don't know, sweetheart.
I-I'd just do what you think is best.
okay. All right.
I love you, too. Bye-bye.
wh-what do you know about cooking beets?
don't do it? - Yeah.
Oh, how old's Charlie, there?
six years old. Peewee basketball.
what's going on, man?
you heard about the sheriff job, right? - I did.
well, who knew Morgan would be a CSI here in Vegas.
you worried about her, or about the job?
I don't know. Both.
I'm not like you; I haven't had the best luck keeping the balancing act going.
Yeah. Right. Why do you think my wife's calling me about beets?
she wants to hear your voice. And I presume you want to hear hers.
proves my point. - True.
you're worried that if you take this job, things could change, just as things have changed for the better, right?
valid concern, don't you think?
I-I've told you the story about my itinerant youth.
your parents and the Volkswagen bus.
dodge van. Sorry.
that wasn't the life I would've chosen, but, you know, it's part of who I am, so I-I like change.
but Barbara can't stand it.
so, what, coming to Vegas... - Did not thrill her.
but she knew how much I wanted it, so... We-we-we work on it, man.
it's a process.
you offered me this job, Conrad, and I... and I took it.
I think you should do yourself the same favor.
you and Morgan'll figure the rest out.
yeah? - I found Ava Rendell's murder weapon.
the rusty metal trace in Ava Rendell's neck wound has a combination of calcium, silicon dioxide and ferric oxide.
all consistent with antique iron made around the 16th century.
suggesting a medieval poleax is our weapon.
technically, it's a war hammer.
or, as the Germans call it, a fussstreithammer.
What-What-Whatever it's called; it would take something like that to be able to decapitate our Miss Rendell, right?
definitely has a stronger blade than a playing card.
all right, all right, look-- the-the ace of spades.
all-all our crime scenes are spotless, but the killer left behind the ace of spades. Why?
I mean, that-that's got to be deliberate.
what did you find out about our card?
I ran the blood. Confirmed that it did kill Peter Coe.
but what about the plastic? What about... what about the ink?
you know, maybe the card itself is part of a message the killer is sending us.
it's just a typical Bicycle card. - Well, you...
that I will happily jump on. - That'd be nice.
Hey, that ace tells us anything new?
something old. It's a high-end, expensive card made from two layers of natural linen.
why is that old?
this particular linen stopped being manufactured in 1998.
I also found a hidden watermark in the latex polymer that glues together the two layers of card.
that's the Palermo logo.
so this was from a special edition deck?
manufactured for the 1997 Palermo Poker Classic.
Peter Coe won that tournament.
the 1997 classic. Third round.
you may recognize some of our players.
Peter Coe, our elevator victim.
Trent Aldridge. Our S&M vic.
eating a chicken wing. That is so wrong.
rounding out the table is the Snake. Bo Mattison.
"hold 'Em" legend, and the master of the "slow play."
he would sit on a great hand, and then wait, like a snake in the grass, before striking without warning.
how does the Snake play into our case?
well, he is about to get the death hand.
and there they are: The ace of spades, the seven of hearts, four of clubs.
I'll be damned.
king of diamonds should be next, right?
that is so creepy.
now, Aldridge folded, and here comes the river card.
king of spades. We haven't seen that yet.
now, the Snake has an ace-king full boat-- very strong-- but Coe has two kings.
and he wins, with four of a kind.
where is this Bo Mattison now?
he is playing the great "Hold 'Em" game in the sky.
he was a meth addict.
countless arrests, broke, and a week after this, he killed himself under a jungle gym in Tresser Park.
what else do we know about this Bo?
Jersey guy. Divorced. Total loner.
so there's an ex-wife in the picture. Is she alive?
I can find out.
if Dr. Jimmy is our prime suspect, there has to be some connection between him and Bo.
so, we need to do some more digging.
I mean, Bo may be dead, but someone out there is killing people.
found Bo Mattison's wife... in the Holy Cross cemetery in Newark, New Jersey.
takes her off the suspect list.
she died, in 1990, of cancer.
any time Bo finished a tournament, he would kiss the St. Catherine medal he wore around his neck.
St. Catherine is the patron saint of cancer.
thinking of his wife-- hold on a sec.
Nick just ran Dr. Jimmy's credit cards.
four months ago, Dr. Jimmy ordered a poleax from a historical society; had it sent to his theater.
James Nefarro. LVPD.
what the hell?
geez, you scared the crap out of me. - You're not the only one.
Where's Dr. Jimmy?
I thought you were him.
he was here? - Five minutes ago.
he told me to lay here and be still. And when he says it, he means it.
he must've seen us coming.
is Jimmy in trouble?
does Dr. Jimmy use an axe in his show?
Yeah. Um, axe... sword, scissors.
he uses them to slice cards.
is the axe here?
it's over there.
well, I think we found Jimmy's axe.
and it looks like there's blood on the blade.
and Jimmy's pulled a vanishing act.
Oh, nice follow-through.
alas, poor Jell-O man.
I knew him well.
well, the tool marks match Ava Rendell's neck wounds.
looks like Dr. Jimmy's our killer.
Yeah. Still doesn't explain why.
I think I know why.
I have been watching Bo Mattison's final hand over and over.
I assume he keeps losing?
he does. To four kings.
now, four of a kind is the third rarest hand in poker.
yet, Peter Coe builds to it with the turn and the river card.
what are the odds? - Yeah, but it's poker, right? I mean, he got lucky.
I don't think luck has anything to do with it.
you think Peter Coe cheated.
I think they all cheated.
watch this.
now, the hardest cheating for a casino to detect isn't card counting or marking the deck.
it's collusion among players.
or as grifters call it, "playing cousins."
now, watch as Coe and Aldridge communicate with each other.
now, Aldridge places a chip on his hole cards, and then, taps it with his finger.
he's telling Coe that he has a lousy hand.
no pairs, off suited.
and Coe?
Coe is going to hold his glass with his right hand, using his thumb and two fingers.
he's telling Aldridge he has two kings.
and Aldridge locks his hands together.
that's the crossfire signal.
they're going to trap Bo with raises and re-raises.
building up the pot.
now, all game, Aldridge bets high and never stays in.
he's feeding Coe all of his chips.
the dealer's name is Glenn Heidbredder.
watch as he deals the turn card.
he's dealing seconds.
he deals that, instead of the deck card.
you're kidding me.
watch it in slow-motion.
Heidbredder died a year later. One survivor, until yesterday.
a daughter. Birth name-- Ava Heidbredder.
daughter of a lifer dealer, just like she said.
okay, so we have... we have two players and a dealer involved in a cheating scam.
what-what about this Ed Ficelli, the... the four of clubs?
well, according to the Gaming Commission's black book of 1997...
what do you do? You keep that on your bed stand?
my iPad.
but according to the book, Ficelli was banned from the casinos in '02 for running a collusion scam at Hold 'Em tables.
so he was the idea man, the-the organizer.
Yeah, but they all cheated Bo Mattison.
they drove him to suicide.
so, if Dr. Jimmy is avenging Bo Mattison, still doesn't answer the question why.
I mean, what's his skin in the game?
Pete Coe, player one in '97, gets the ace of spades.
Trent Aldridge, player two in '97-- seven of hearts.
ed Ficelli,'97 ringleader, gets four of clubs.
Ava Rendell, daughter of the '97 dealer-- king of diamonds.
my question to you is-- who gets the king of spades?
who's our next victim?
nobody. Everyone from Bo's table's dead.
and Dr. Jimmy already finishes his hand.
Yeah, and his last trick was a disappearing act.
that doesn't make sense to me, though.
I mean, why would Dr. Jimmy leave us with one extra card, and then vanish?
then how do you account for the king of spades?
maybe it's Jimmy. We've been assuming that he's our killer.
what if he's the final victim?
well, Jimmy has been known to stake players.
Peter Coe, our elevator victim, for one.
you think Dr. Jimmy was Bo Mattison's money man back in '97?
well, we know that Bo was broke.
maybe Dr. Jimmy supplies the patsy with the buy-in money.
if that were the case, that would make Dr. Jimmy a coconspirator in the cheating scam.
and the next to die.
Hey, I got a partial profile off the epithelials on the poleax.
strs show a female familial match with Bo Mattison.
could be a daughter, a sister...
looked into Bo Mattison. He's an only child.
so, then, a daughter?
explains the rage. The overkill.
it was someone close to him.
or someone who wanted to be close to him.
it was right in front of us.
St. Catherine's medal.
we thought he... he was doing that to honor his wife, but I think... I think it was for someone else.
someone whose name is Catherine.
katy Hill. Dr. Jimmy's assistant.
she had access to the ax. Set Jimmy up.
you know, magician as misdirect. Look over here.
while she's pulling off one last trick.
right.
excuse me.
where?
okay, thank you.
LVPD just found Dr. Jimmy's car in Tresser Park. No sign of Jimmy.
Tresser Park? That's...That's where Bo Mattison killed himself.
katy is going to kill Dr. Jimmy there.
let's pop the trunk.
garden spade.
no dirt on it. Probably hasn't even been used.
that means Dr. Jimmy might still be alive.
all right, guys, we need to fan out and search the area.
let's do this.
show me your hands. Your hands!
it's you. Good.
Where's Jimmy?
you mean the river card?
I know what they did to your father.
you figured out who I am.
when my mom died last year, I went through her stuff, and I found this note that Bo wrote me.
he figured out he'd been cheated.
but it was too late.
the truth is, those bastards cheated me as much as they cheated him.
it's hard.
the pain of not having a father. The anger.
I know.
you don't know anything about me.
I know that you're suffering.
part of you wants this to end.
Dr. Jimmy is out there somewhere, alive, and the best thing that you can do for yourself is to let him go.
you want me to show you my cards?
Jimmy is in Hell with the rest of them!
very naughty.
I'll show you where I buried him.
you're bluffing. - What?
you're slow-playing me, just like your dad.
you led us here. You're buying time.
Nick, you still at the theater? - Yeah.
Dr. Jimmy is there.
never... trust an assistant with sharp objects.
I got him. He's okay.
No!
last woman standing.
how does it feel?
they're over here!
you okay? - Yeah.
heard you did well tonight.
Yeah, I was just doing my job.
you sure you're okay?
I've-I've... I've had to shoot... shoot at people.
I've never... I've never really had to...
you and I have been getting in a lot of close scrapes lately, huh?
it's better than sitting behind a desk, I guess.
Oh, I... I didn't mean... Sorry.
that's not what I meant at all. - No, no, I know... I know what you mean.
but then again, it's not so bad when you get to pick your own desk.
you signed the sheriff paperwork. - I did.
wait-- seriously?
sheriff Ecklie.
that's awesome.
I don't know. It feels right.
Yeah. It is.
got reservations at Mastro's. You want to celebrate?
Yeah. I do.
you sure? - Uh, absolutely.
I'm all in. Let's do it.
ms. Vasquez.
I have the black you requested.
would you like the brown as well?
no, the Ferragamo, por favor.
Siempre me tratas bien.
thank you, Oscar.
Claro que s..., Ms. Vasquez.
Cualquier cosa para mi mejor cliente.
check you out.
too much?
are you kidding? I could never wear that.
I hate you.
it shouldn't be this loose, should it?
try on a muumuu or a poncho for me, will you?
so I have a fighting chance.
and lock your door. I could have been some creep.
one fatality.
I'm surprised there wasn't more.
her name was Kim Walderman, 17 years old.
I heard her friend in the dressing room next door sustained only minor injuries.
how is that possible?
well...the blast was confined to this space.
the question is: where is the source?
I won't be able to get a good look at her trauma in here.
the clothing is fused to her body.
you'll keep me posted on that, please.
Yeah.
why target a fashion boutique?
it seems so random.
on the contrary.
this was by design.
I just had those virtual dressing rooms installed.
you don't, you don't think there was a malfunction or something, do you?
Mr. Serino, we believe this was intentional.
can you think of someone with a grudge?
anyone who might want to ruin your business?
I opened six months ago.
the competition next door would love nothing more than to see me fall flat on my face, but to blow up my store...
uh... maybe.
how many customers did you have this morning?
a handful. We opened two hours ago.
you have any surveillance footage from security cameras?
this isn't a drugstore.
our fashion is exclusive.
important people pay top dollar.
they don't want a camera recording their every move.
we're gonna need all of your customer receipts and employee records.
okay, you just
gentlemen, would you, would you excuse me, please?
get your hands off me.
don't make me use the cuffs, Ms. Winston.
excuse me.
how many times do I have to tell you it is not Get in the car.
excuse me.
what is going on?
this is a stupid mix-up.
I wrote a bad check in there, and now Keystone Cop over here is turning it into a big deal.
okay, Julia, would you give us a moment, please?
what happened in there?
she's a repeat offender, Lieutenant.
the merchant inside has already filed a fraud affidavit regarding Ms. Winston.
he caught her again trying to pass another bad check.
what is the total?
6000.0
I'll take it from here, okay?
talk to me.
Ron brought in this guy Leonard McBride.
he's, he's a business manager -
supposed to watch our money, but I can't trust him.
I mean, wha-- do you see what's happening here?
all right. I'm going to talk to Leonard, but no more bad checks, Julia.
fine.
are you all right?
I'm fine.
let's get you home.
buy rate is 30 to one.
condo sales are at an all-time low.
invest it now, make money later.
that's how this works.
take off, gentlemen.
you better have a good explanation for this.
shut up, Leonard.
she's a client of mine, yeah.
she claims that you are stealing from her.
you're misinformed.
Julia has lost her money, but she has only herself to blame.
how so?
look, she squandered millions of dollars.
uh, rolled everything into venture capital-- obsolete companies, bankrupt businesses.
not to mention Ron Saris, who hired you, I understand.
Hey, if the man in her life buys a luxury yacht and then disappears, there's not a whole lot I can do.
this woman is spiraling real bad, Lieutenant.
I really think she's losing touch with reality.
listen to me, you're burning through cash like nobody's business. - Enough.
you could wind up with nothing! - No. I don't have to listen to anyone.
get out.
get out!
she owes me almost a year's worth of compensation.
and-and I have to say, uh, working for free is getting a little old.
Leonard, a word to the wise: this better be the truth.
finish your lunch.
we're gonna have a lot of fun collecting all of this stuff.
tell me about it.
what do you need me to do?
well, I'm really just looking for something that'll tie all this to the explosion.
what was up on this wall, a TV screen?
an LCD touch screen.
every possible wardrobe combination at your fingertips.
well, whatever happened to just standing in front of a mirror?
well, a mirror can't remember everything that you've tried on.
so this LCD screen could remember the moment our girl died.
Yeah, if we could put it back together, maybe.
Hi.
you looking for me?
Yeah.
I wanted you to have a look at this.
looks like she took quite a hit to her abdomen.
major trauma, right?
now take a look at her upper torso and face.
the trauma caused by the explosion is completely localized.
Yeah. There should be, uh, collateral burns, there should be puncture wounds from debris.
her neck and back also relatively unscathed.
so it's like the blast originated from her abdomen and moved outwards away from her.
exactly. Now, take a look at her clothes.
are those copper wires?
two.
showed up on the lateral-projection X ray.
both connected to the top ends of the zipper.
wait a second, there's something under here.
a watch battery.
this is enough to set off a small amount of C-4.
but what triggered it?
the zipper.
the two pieces of metal came together and completed the circuit.
my God.
she was wearing the bomb.
okay, yeah, I guess I could have handed her the dress, but what does that have to do with anything?
because it was rigged to explode, Mr. Serino.
what?
follow me.
Hey, Jane, what you got?
the virtual dressing room rises again.
the display panel's hard drive is set up to dump its video every couple of minutes, but the explosion blew out the motherboard.
can you pull anything?
just the last few moments.
that was me.
I handed her that silk top right there.
but that dress that she's wearing right now...
I don't sell that here.
are you sure?
all my clothes are 100% animal friendly.
that's suede.
that means someone walked into the store and delivered the bomb personally.
Hi, you've reached the voicemail for Julia Winston.
please leave a message after the beep.
Hey, Julia, it's me.
listen, I had a conversation with our friend, Leonard.
I'm on my way...
I got to call you back.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
get off me!
get off. Get off me.
Hey, get off him!
get off him.
what is going on here?
you got some nerve, kid, taking a swing at me in my own driveway.
this kid's out of control.
excuse me, but it doesn't look like he's alone.
if he steps foot on my property one more time, I'm gonna press charges.
fair enough.
have a good day.
you're picking fights with neighbors?
dad, he...he's a jerk, and he has a big mouth, all right?
son, somebody with your history cannot afford to be arrested again, can you?
no.
okay.
is your mother home?
no.
where did she go?
I don't know; she never tells me anything.
okay, I'll take care of it.
go in the house.
dad... I'm worried about her.
she's not acting normal.
okay, son.
go in the house, let me take care of it.
cracking the case, are you?
Oh, I'm cracking it wide open.
I brought you something.
it might help.
what you got?
take a look.
is this from the blast?
how did we miss this?
building inspector found it in the ceiling between floors one and two.
a driver's license-- Kim Walderman.
this is the vic's purse.
pretty big chunk of change for a teenager, don't you think?
Yeah, you think?
about five grand.
what else we got in here?
we got matches, a bunch of broken security tags.
a knife.
for shoplifting.
kids will heat that knife up, cut the plastic ink tags off of stolen clothing.
okay, so that's probably how she came under all this cash.
she was shopping with a friend, wasn't she?
Yeah, she was-- the friend's in the hospital.
might be the next move.
Yep
how are you feeling?
the doctor put in a few stitches, antibiotics.
said I'll be fine.
good.
you know you were lucky.
Yeah, wish I could say the same for Kim.
look, they said they were gonna take me home.
why am I here?
I need you to show me what's under your blouse.
you're kidding, right?
you're gonna sexually harass me now?
you know what this is about, Amy.
no, actually, I don't.
I need you to lift up your shirt.
okay, Kim and I were into shoplifting.
we didn't hurt anyone.
well, you obviously pissed somebody off, because Kim had $5, 000 in her purse, and now she's dead.
who were you selling the merchandise to?
college dorms and stuff.
not that many college students with an extra $5, 000 laying around.
so who hired you?
nobody.
I was in it for the fun, I swear.
that fun turned into a felony.
you're under arrest.
grand theft.
what are you doing here?
are you following me?
selling your house?
Leonard McBride robbed me blind, okay?
and living here ain't cheap.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to tell me what's really going on here.
I don't know what you're talking about.
look, Julia, when was the last time you took your medication?
don't make this about that.
but this is exactly what it's about.
you're sliding, and I can see it.
my friend, Ron, was right about the pills.
I'm not myself on them.
have you consulted a doctor about that?
I'm gonna deal with this on my terms.
you trying to figure out where Kim Walderman's money came from?
Yeah, well, I...I figured that the iodine would be more delicate than ninhydrin.
why only two bills?
well, whoever handled the cash handled it as a bundle.
so they might have left prints, but only on the outer-facing top and bottom bills.
those bills are gonna have dozens of prints on top of prints.
that's right, but if we get the same print on both, then I know the cash was handled by that person as a bundle.
So...we've got two sets of matching prints.
okay, so one of them's got to be Kim Walderman.
right.
that's correct, there she is.
all right, let's see who the other set belongs to.
Dr. Robert Langley.
got no priors for theft.
Yeah, but not exactly innocent, either.
he was accused of sexual misconduct with a patient.
Yeah.
I'd like to know what the hell he's doing giving a 17-year-old a stack of cash.
the sexual misconduct was a false accusation.
the charges were dropped.
the lawsuit wasn't.
I'm a plastic surgeon.
my patients are insecure, some of them, deeply unhappy.
that particular one, did not like what I had to say about her during a consultation.
she lashed out.
listen, my daughter and I have someplace to be in an hour.
can I go now?
what about this young lady?
is she a patient of yours?
let me refresh your memory, Dr. Langley.
we found your fingerprints on a large amount of cash in her purse.
Yes. I met Kim.
she came to me, wanted a breast enlargement.
but you didn't oblige?
of course not-- she's 17-years-old.
you're too young.
give it a few years. Come back when you're ready.
I am ready.
I can pay cash.
here.
we shouldn't even be discussing this while your parents aren't here.
sorry, Ms. Walderman, I won't do it.
I gave her her money back, along with some sound advice.
she was murdered this morning.
I'm so sorry to hear that, I...
did she give you any indication of where she'd gotten the money?
no.
but I do have a daughter that same age, Ms. Duquesne.
you should see the allowance she gets.
thank you for your time, Doctor.
what do you got, Frank?
I just got a call, fatal hit and run.
vic's a blonde, adult male.
okay?
it's Julia's address.
Where's Kyle, Frank?
I don't know.
Dr. Price.
we don't have an I. D. yet.
it looks like a hit and run.
his name is Bryce Kerwin.
he lives across the street.
well, I got a bottle of pills in his pocket.
it's Lamotrigine.
it's bipolar medication for Julia Winston.
where is she?
inside, she won't come out.
thank you.
is that you, John?
I lie to you, John.
I do.
then again, you lie to me, too.
don't you, John Walden?
Julia, that was a long time ago.
I was undercover.
where is Kyle?
he left.
where did he go?
don't know. I'm not sure what happened.
there was a fight.
Kyle! Kyle, stop it!
what's wrong with you?
calm down!
don't tell me to calm down!
get out!
are you giving these to him?
you need these!
get out!
get out of here!
get out of here, both of you!
stop it!
leave!
no, wait!
don't go, please!
Bryce was stealing my medication.
Bryce is lying dead in the driveway, Julia, hit by your car.
now, listen to me, did you or Kyle have anything to do with this?
Julia, look at me.
where is Kyle?
he was just trying to protect me.
who's going to protect him now?
he's dead?
Bryce Kerwin is dead?
he was killed in your mother's driveway by your mother's car.
do you have a set of those keys?
Yeah, I mean, she lets me drive the Porsche.
did you use the vehicle today?
no. Dad, I...
dad, listen to me.
I did not do this.
Kyle, you had a public fight with this man.
that's gonna be a problem.
I was only trying to protect Mom.
he was stealing her meds.
why didn't you tell me about this before?
I...I don't know.
I thought I could handle it on my own.
Look...there's only one other set of keys.
if there's a chance that Mom did do this...
hang, hang on.
just hang on.
look, if it comes to that, I want you to put me in that driver's seat.
that's not the way it works, Kyle.
H, I heard about what's going on with Julie and Kyle.
I came to help.
bottom line, Eric, I can't find anything to exonerate either one of them.
if I don't, that kid is going back to jail.
there's got to be something.
let's go through it one more time.
there's something here.
Eric, that is crab shell.
so, Leonard, how did the rest of lunch turn out?
not too productive.
Why?
because it turns out, you left some of it behind, in Julia's car when you stole it this afternoon.
you don't understand.
sure, I do.
Julia was burning through so much cash.
I realized I was never going to get paid.
so you decided to abscond with her vehicle as collateral.
I just wanted to ensure that I got some kind of payment.
the guy came out of nowhere.
look, I am not a criminal, Lieutenant.
you are now, Leonard.
lieutenant?
you be careful of Julia.
she'll bring you down, too.
Oh, great. You've reassembled the bomb.
Yeah, what's left of it.
problem is, bomb maker didn't leave behind any sort of unique signature.
this guy really knew what he was doing.
what sort of explosive was used?
very thin plastique.
he concealed it by sewing it into the seam here.
you know, he may be a good bomb maker, but who's to say he's a good dressmaker?
that's a really good point.
I'll, I'll check the seams he mended.
Yeah, it's worth a try.
he's got a history with explosives.
Yeah, four misdemeanor explosives charges.
he blew up a college statue and a neighbor's pool table.
spent two years in jail.
looks like Stan's up to his old tricks.
not if I have anything to do with it.
I'm CSI Wolfe.
this is CSI Delko.
do you mind if we step in for a second?
csi?
Yeah, sure.
Stan's my roommate.
is everything all right?
where is he now?
I don't know. He left like, 6:00 this morning.
I haven't seen him since.
what time do you expect him back?
I don't know.
he's like a handyman or something.
Stan works days, I work nights.
I'm just subletting from him.
we hardly ever see each other.
all right, we're gonna have to take a look around.
Yeah, go ahead.
that's his room right there.
it's locked, though. He never lets anybody in there.
imagine living with a bomber and not even knowing it?
okay, see this?
this is the same wires we found in the bomb.
and this thread matches the thread in the dress.
that's not all.
there's a shopping bag full of size two women's clothing here.
some pulled apart.
Stan was trying to find the best fit for his bomb.
where are the clothes from?
Feratelli's.
that store happens to be right across the street from our bomb site.
Hi, I'm Calleigh Duquesne, CSI.
are you Ms. Feratelli?
I am.
I heard someone died in Oscar's store.
the street's been shut down all morning.
we believe the dress the victim was wearing came from your store.
I made that.
it was one of a kind.
it was rigged with a bomb.
do you remember who bought it?
no, but I can tell you who stole it.
some bitch with a baby carriage.
what makes you so certain about that?
after she left, I saw the empty hangers, so I ran out to look for her.
I found the stroller ditched a half-block away.
Hey!
what the...
she must've seen me coming.
she left some of the merchandise behind.
Where's the stroller now?
I have it in back.
I'm gonna need to take it with me.
I didn't know you were expecting.
cute.
no, this is the stroller used to smuggle the bomb dress out of Feratelli's clothing store.
you find anything that might lead us to our bomber?
no.
unfortunately, nothing's popping at all.
no prints, there's no visible trace.
what about this blanket?
does this feel heavy to you?
Yeah, and rigid.
that's not exactly baby friendly.
let's take a look at it.
what's aluminum foil doing in here?
it's a conducting material.
bet you they use it to shield whatever they're covering from radio frequencies.
okay.
allowing the user to bypass the store's security system.
that's right
I think I know who this belongs to.
let me guess, you want me to take my pants off this time.
why don't you drop the sarcasm, Amy?
right now, the shoplifting is the least of your worries.
do you want to tell us more about the baby stroller scam?
I didn't think so.
somebody stop that girl!
what about Stan Carlyle?
you know him?
no.
who is he?
he's the man that rigged the dress that killed your friend.
the dress that you stole.
this isn't fair.
what's not fair?
this.
kim was the one targeting clothes from Ocean Drive magazine.
what do you mean, targeting?
you know, like specific lists with stores and designers.
who gave her the lists?
they killed my friend.
I don't think it's wise to say anything.
Hey, you can't take that.
I'd like to see what your phone has to tell us.
cell phones are lifelines to kids nowadays.
couple of minutes, we'll see who she knows and where she goes.
we've got some text messages, her call log, photos.
wait a second.
that's the murder victim.
she's standing outside the fitting room.
that's a crime scene.
I can enlarge it some more, but I'm afraid that's as good as you're gonna get.
no, I got everything I need.
I know who I got to bring in.
Thanks.
didn't you guys get enough the first time around?
sorry, Barry. Sometimes it takes us a while to get our ducks in a row.
but I do apologize.
the reason we have you here is because, well, we're charging you with first-degree murder.
you're serious.
Yeah. I got a photo of you delivering the bomb that killed Kim Walderman.
I'll tell you what gave you away: your watch.
my watch.
I recognized it from your apartment earlier today.
what, the one you can find at almost any department store in the country?
come on, I thought you were looking for my roommate, Stan.
stop trying to railroad me and find him.
I have found him.
I found him.
he's sitting right in front of me.
BarryStan-- whatever your name is, you're the same guy.
you have no roommate.
you're the bomber.
what are you talking about?
we took a look at your fingerprints, and I noticed this.
I don't see anything.
exactly.
your fingers didn't leave any prints.
so what?
so I did a little background check on your...roommate Stan.
and six months ago, it turns out, he admitted himself to the hospital with severe first-degree burns on his hands and face.
this photo was taken pre-surgery courtesy of the Miami-Dade Burn Ward.
you hurt yourself pretty bad practicing your little hobby of making bombs, didn't you, Barry?
well, it turns out, you can change your face, but luckily for guys like me, you can't change your DNA.
now, I've got a sample of Stan's DNA.
are you real gonna make me run it against yours?
look, I am sorry for what happened to that girl.
I really am.
but you don't understand.
he... he saved my life.
who did?
the man who...
who gave me a face.
I was so disfigured, I couldn't even step outside.
so your doctor put you up to this.
he asked me to custom-make a bomb for him.
how could I say no?
you should've said no.
Hello, Dr. Langley.
ms. Duquesne.
so I have a paparazzi photograph here in Ocean Drive magazine of your daughter, taken at an event last week
wearing not only a stolen dress, but the dress that killed Kim Walderman this morning.
there's lots of dresses out there, Ms. Duquesne.
it's true.
but there are not a lot of bomb makers, and certainly not a lot of ones whose faces you've reconstructed.
Stan Carlyle's talking.
I live a high-profile life.
but with the economy, elective surgery's one of the first luxuries to go.
it's important to keep up appearances even if business is on the decline.
my daughter, my wife...
I need to take care of them the way everyone expects me to.
perception creates a lot of pressure.
so it was cheaper to have Kim Walderman steal for you?
thought it was a win-win.
she even recruited a friend to help.
but then, like every teenager, she got greedy.
what do you have for me?
Amy and I are so busy, I don't even know what's in the bags anymore.
my daughter will love this.
there's your money.
and ll schedule your breast augmentation for three weeks from now.
that's not the deal anymore.
I want the big money.
the big money?
I'm giving you plenty.
forget it.
didn't they already get you for sexual misconduct once?
I wonder who they'd believe if a 17-year-old girl like me told a little story like that.
it'd probably be a while before you saw your daughter again.
you give an inch, they take a yard.
you took a life.
teenagers talk without thought of consequence.
so...I called in a favor.
to shut her up.
nice.
can you do the job?
hell, yeah.
I could wire a cloud to blow.
you can find her in four days at Oscar Serino's.
be ready.
Yeah. Done.
you're under arrest, Doctor.
what are these, bitch cuffs?
hold still. - My hand, man!
I said hold still!
Cadillac Kligman. Six Million Dollar Man.
six pins in his leg and a bunch of screws loosin his head.
and I was hoping for a slow day.
I'll get started on the paperwork. Better get him out of here.
have fun.
what the hell are you doing?
that's my desk! Get down now!
get on the floor now! - Get in there!
get him down!
I need an ambulance in here! Get me an ambulance!
come on, Todd, come on! - What happened?
I don't know, one minute he was fine, then he started convulsing and he fell over.
come on, kid. Come on!
he's dead.
don, he's dead.
I was questioning him.
he was getting agitated, then he started talking crazy.
then he started shaking.
foam was coming out of his mouth and he hit the ground.
don't worry.
Sid will get to the bottom of it.
detective Flack.
you mind answering a few questions? - No problem.
don, don't you want to wait for a union rep?
no, no, no, no. I'd rather take care of this now.
okay, you can start by filling out this incident report.
when did you first encounter Mr. Fleming?
earlier today.
he was at wrestling practice over at Hillridge High School.
detective Angell and I went by and asked him to come downtown with us.
What'd you pick him up for?
because he was a potential suspect in the Vincent Nelson homicide and we wanted to ask him questions about his relationship with Mr. Nelson.
and what was the subject's physical condition when you first saw him?
nothing unusual. Maybe he was a little nervous.
cops make some people nervous.
but basically he was fine? - Yes.
no cuts, no bruises, no scrapes? - No.
what about the abrasion on the side of his head?
he walk in with that?
during the interview, he grew agitated.
started flailing around. I had to restrain him.
when I let go, he slipped and fell off the chair.
17-year-old boys don't just slip and fall and then drop dead.
and they also don't require a guardian to be present during questioning.
so maybe you gave him a little push.
you know what?
I changed my mind.
if you want my statement, G. O.15 me.
I want my union attorney.
2 days ago
flying tomato over here took a dip in the garbage while he was snowboarding.
landed right next to the foot.
the rest of the body?
we're canvassing garbage receptacles in the area.
the city only picks up trash once a week on account of the budget cuts.
this place is turning into a cesspool.
look what I found.
it's got dried blood all over it.
looks like the foot was wrapped in it.
now I've heard of re-gifting, but this is pushing it.
Danny and Hawkes just found an arm in a trash bin a couple blocks away.
that looks to be male Caucasian.
same as the foot that Mac found.
wrapping paper's a match, too.
I'm thinking Christmas with the in-laws.
degree of decomp puts the time of death between 6: 00 and 9: 00 last night.
mercifully, the dismemberment came later.
kill a man and then chop him up into pieces.
maybe the killer thought little pieces would be easier to dispose of.
there is a certain logic.
any idea what he used to cut him up?
haven't seen this particular wound pattern before.
there's lateral movement at the incision, bordered by these jagged punctures.
maybe I can give you a hand.
okay.
department of Sanitation found it in a storm drain five blocks from the foot.
the top layer of skin is separating from the underlying tissue.
Yeah, it looks like it was submerged in water for a while.
if the glove fits...
oceans And Streams - by The Black Keys
Vince was the head wrestling coach at Hillridge High for eight years.
five championships.
are you positive it's really him? I mean...
I mean, how can you be sure?
maybe there's been some kind of mix-up.
we've identified him by his fingerprints.
every employee in the school system has them on file.
Mrs. Nelson, when was the last time you saw your husband?
yesterday at breakfast.
he was taking a business class at NYU on Thursday nights.
he wanted to open his own wrestling school.
so he never came home last night after class?
I fell asleep.
I called the police in the morning when he wasn't home.
but they said I had to wait 48 hours before he'd be officially missing.
looks like your husband was quite a successful coach.
Mrs. Nelson, can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt your husband?
no. Vince was a great guy.
everyone admired him.
did he owe anybody money?
or have a drug problem or a gambling habit?
I'm sorry...
but if you knew him, you'd know how ridiculous your questions are.
okay. Thank you so much.
please, give us a call us if you remember anything else.
there was one thing.
I don't see how it could be related, but yesterday when I came home from work, someone was lurking on our roof.
I saw their shadows through the skylights there.
looked like two people.
I heard them talking. Creeping around.
it was kind of scary.
what time was this?
around 4: 00.
I knocked ony neighbor's door. He said he would go up and check.
And?
he said he saw something that looked like blood, but no people.
she said she saw them from the skylight.
Yeah, this would be the Nelsons' apartment right here.
Yup, here we go.
this is the blood the neighbor was talking about.
boom.
so get this, there's no Thursday night business classes at NYU or any of its extension schools.
and there's no Vince Nelson registered with them period.
nelson was lying to his wife.
he also withdrew 200 bucks from an ATM on the Upper West Side the night he was killed.
maybe he had something going on the side?
confiscate his computer, bank records, credit card statements.
I want to know what else he was hiding. - Done.
what are you working on?
the blood we found on Nelson's roof.
I thought whoever was up there could've been connected to the case, but it isn't human.
take a look.
cells have nuclei, it looks like some kind of animal.
it's a very large animal with claws and scales.
the blood comes from an alligator, Mac.
Mr. Potato Head.
the live version.
more like the bloody dead version.
I used to play Mr. Potato head as a boy. I would time myself.
see how long it took to assemble him.
some would say I was obsessed.
you, obsessed? No.
I found this stuck in a patch of dried blood on Nelson's torso.
looks like some ki of jewelry.
it's an acupressure magnet.
you put it on a meridian of the ear to quit smoking.
my mom tried everything.
then I'm almost certain it didn't belong to the vic.
his lungs were pink as a baby's.
alas, his spine was not in such pristine condition.
same marks as on the flesh, but it looks like some sort of thermal burn on the bone.
kinetic energy.
whatever the killer used to dismember the body was starting to heat up.
so he must have dismembered the torso last.
that explains why we only found burns there.
I also discovered trace in the victim's chest hair.
looks like sawdust.
sawdust. Between that and the thermal burning on the bone.
I'm thinking some kind of chainsaw.
but what type of chainsaw leaves jagged wounds like this?
I Need To Know-by Marc Anthony
mind if I cut in?
prostitution?
come on, Ms. Love, I got a rap sheet here says you've been arrested four times for solicitation.
I'll see you next week, George.
Mm-hmm, okay.
this isn't what you think, Detective.
this isn't what you think either, Ms. Love.
I'm not Vice. I'm with Homicide.
and we have your fingerprint on this acupressure disc.
I bought one of those to quit smoking. I lost it.
well, we found it near this guy. You know him?
that's Vince. Vince Nelson.
why are you looking for him?
Becaushe was killed.
when was the last time you saw him?
last night.
he comes here every Thursday night for a lesson.
exactly what do you teach?
private Salsa lessons?
is that what they call it these days?
no, these were legit.
nelson wanted to surprise his wife for their fifth anniversary.
take her out dancing.
and our Salsa instructor had a client right after Nelson who corroborated her alibi.
mac, I found something on Coach Nelson's computer you should see.
this kid can't be more than ten years old.
it gets worse.
all right.
these photos were attached to an e-mail that Nelson sent out to seven of his wrestling students.
this e-mail went out at 4: 00 P. M.Three hours later, Vince Nelson was dead.
you think we just found our motive?
someone may've gotten this e-mail and snapped.
but if the Coach Nelson was a pedophile, why would he incriminate himself by sending it outo members of his own team?
maybe he molested some of these boys before and knew they wouldn't tell.
the whole thing makes me sick.
no. Pedophiles usually download photos and trade with other short eyes.
if that's the case, I'm betting there's more where these came from.
find them.
we had one victim, but now we have two.
this boy is too young to be a student at Hillridge High.
we need to know who he is and how Vince Nelson knew him.
I'll reach out to the Bureau of Missing and Exploited Children, see if we can come up with any leads.
pedophile coach.
maybe he got what was coming to him.
the day he died, Nelson e-mailed the photos to seven kids on his wrestling team.
one of them could've been embarrassed, humiliated...
or just flat-out enraged.
I'll track them down, see what they got to say.
found the kind of chainsaw we're looking for.
it's new on the market.
serrated shears on the bottom, chainsaw on the top.
Tool-mark pattern's a match to the body parts we found.
call the manufacturer.
get a list of credit card purchasers, cross reference them against...
to the last names on the e-mails. Did it, done. Nothing.
okay. What about the sawdust?
the sawdust. Still working on it.
the problem is the DNA from the tree contains endogenous chemicals which inhibit analysis.
that means it's gonna be really difficult to narrow it down to a specific species.
well, that tree could point us in the direction of our killer.
go with conventional methods instead.
extract organic compounds, run 'em through the GCMS. - All right.
Hey, I think I just connected the alligator blood that we found on Nelson's roof.
according to the principal at Hillridge High, they had a science fair three days ago.
and the winning project was about the immunological properties of alligator blood.
the creator of this project, Todd Fleming, is also on the wrestling team.
I worked with Coach Nelson every day for three years.
we went to meets together, had a few beers after work, then I find out he's into something like this.
any of the guys on the team talked about the e-mail or the murder?
no, not in front of me, anyway.
we got state championship coming up tomorrow.
that what they're focusing on.
life goes on, right?
not for everybody.
is Todd Fleming around?
we want to ask him a few questions.
Fleming! Front and center.
come on! Keep it going!
look, I don't know anything about what happened, okay?
none of us do.
if that's why you guys came down here...
we found alligator blood on Coach Nelson's roof.
we think it was a part of your science project.
what were you doing up there, Todd?
I wasn't up there. I...
look, even if I was, up there, what does it matter?
cause it's a murder investigation, smart guy. Everything matters.
I didn't kill him.
we'll talk about this downtown.
I'm in the middle of practice. - Practice can wait.
am I under arrest or something?
look, Todd, do you have any street clothes you can change into?
we just want to talk to you.
Yeah, in, in the locker room. - Let's go.
what are these, bitch cuffs?
my hand, man! No!
better get him out of here. - Have fun.
what the hell are you doing?
I want to talk to you about the e-mail Coach Nelson sent you.
what?
the day he was murdered. Hey, Todd, wake up.
I know you got Nelson's e-mail and I know you were on his roof.
it's crazy. This is our fault.
was there someone else involved?
it wasn't supposed...
you talking about Vince Nelson's murder?
can I go or what? - Todd!
your coach was murdered!
now tell me what do I gotta do to get your attention here!
get down on the floor now!
I need an ambulance in here! Get me an ambulance!
preliminary cause of death is hypoxia which presented in cardiac arrest.
did he have a history of brain seizures?
medical records are on the way.
he was a wrestler. He might've had a previous head injury.
there were also several bruises on his arm, fractured ribs.
well, that could've happened while Flack was performing CPR.
what about this abrasion?
based on the lack of subdermal bruising, it occurred moments before death.
you saying Flack hit him?
mac, I'll know more when I open him up, complete my examination.
I did a preliminary tox screen for heroin, cocaine, PCP, methamphetamine, marijuana and alcohol.
all were negative.
don Flack did not kill this boy.
find out what did.
now when you and Detective Flack first approached Todd Fleming, he was at wrestling practice, correct?
that's correct.
and what was his demeanor?
he was fine.
so the kid's calm, perfectly healthy.
he agrees to take a ride with you down to the station house.
he's calm when you walk him through the precinct, he's calm when you bring him in the interrogation room.
and then in less than five minutes, he suddenly becomes agitated, has to be subdued, and now he's dead.
that's exactly what appened.
and if I knew why, I wouldn't be sitting here with you.
did you notice any injuries when you picked Fleming up?
bruises? - No.
was Detective Flack ever alone with him? In the car, maybe?
I drove.
detective Flack sat in the back with Mr. Fleming.
we were together the entire time.
what about at the school?
Fleming was in his street clothes at the time of his death.
I'm assuming he changed somewhere?
in the locker room.
who accompanied him there?
detective Flack.
detective Flack.
doesn't look good.
until you hear different, I'm placing you, on Modified Assignment.
as soon as we're done here, you can surrender your gun and your shield to the Lieutenant downstairs.
what ever happened to giving a guy the benefit of the doubt?
take a look in my personnel folder. Not one civilian complaint.
not one allegation of excessive force. Nothing.
now come on. That's gotta account for something!
the only thing that counts for something is what happened inside this room.
look, Detective Flack did everything by the book.
the guy's a total professional.
unlike your relationship with him, which I understand is less than professional?
not only is that none of your business, but it has nothing to do with Todd Fleming's death.
say hello to the newest member of the rubber gun squad.
I've been officially removed from active duty.
how do they know we're seeing each other, Don?
who? - Internal Affairs.
but I thought we were trying to keep this thing quiet?
I didn't say anything to anyone. That only leaves you.
people talk. They make assumptions.
because of those assumptions now, my word doesn't mean squat with IA.
I mean, who could've told them? - Look, Jess, I'm sorry.
but I got bigger things to worry about right now than squad room gossip.
right.
detective Angell's working this case until IA's finished with their inquiry.
inquiry? Is that what they're calling it?
they can't possibly think that Flack's responsible for Todd Fleming's death.
I mean, he is so by the book. He doesn't even swear.
none of us are happy about this.
in the meantime, IA's got a job to do and so do we.
all right, well, Fleming's been ruled out as a suspect in Coach Nelson's death.
according to his mother, he was taking an SAT prep class at the time of Vince Nelson's murder.
the police confirmed that.
still working on the sawdust, but based on extracted hydrocarbons...
I've narrowed it down to three families.
good. Stay with it.
Yeah, well, I wasn't so lucky with the Christmas wrapping paper.
it's manufactured in China and mass-marketed to department stores all over the U. S.
I'll be right there.
they just found a head.
he's coming together.
cod was hypoxia due to crushed cricoid cartilage which obstructed airflow to the lungs.
lateral bruising on his throat.
he was hit with something hard, a club or a pipe. Look at this.
cauliflower ear. From his wrestling days.
same chainsaw tool marks as the other body parts.
I also found this fleck of blood adhering to the skin at the contusion site on the vic's throat.
and unlike the blood around the wound, this particle was deposited when it was already dry.
which means it could've come from our killer.
Stell, results on the blood fleck that Sid collected from the vic's neck.
not a match to our vic.
Johnny Holt. Ex-con.
he was in for sex crimes. Just got released two weeks ago.
Thanks.
hello.
how are you holding up?
fantastic.
what's a five-letter word for a cooking utensil?
a whisk?
that would be it.
we're all rooting for you.
I want you to know that.
thank you. I appreciate that.
you here to see Johnny Holt?
Yes, I am.
we found his blood on Vince Nelson's throat.
Holt's a bad dude.
if he gives you any problems, let me know.
I'll get in there and beat him up for you.
whisk. I knew that.
never seen him before.
there's traces of your blood on him.
my blood's all over this city.
been shot nine times, knifed five.
we believe the victim was involved in child pornography.
do you recognize this boy?
you implying I'm into kids?
because I sure as hell don't fly that way.
right. Right, you prefer to rape grown women. I forgot.
they said it was rape. Not me.
where were you on Thursday?
on a date. - With who?
I didn't catch her name.
but she wasn't as hot as you.
Holt's blood is on the victim, he's got priors and his alibi is just as worthless as he is.
in other words, Mr. Holt just became our prime suspect.
now all we have to do is shore up motive.
I've been working on that.
so far, I haven't been able to find a single connection between him and Nelson.
and I doubt you will.
ribosomal analysis shows that the sample of Johnny Holt's blood that we found on our vic is at least three months old.
while he was still in Sing Sing.
Sid found the dried blood on Nelson's throat.
said he must've been hit there with a pipe or club.
the blood must've been on the murder weapon.
transferred onto Nelson when he was killed.
I think we just found our connection.
no. I've never seen him.
are you sure? He might've been an acquaintance of your husband's?
absolutely not.
what about this boy?
I don't recognize this child at all.
and to save you a question, I have no idea what these pictures are doing on Vince's computer.
ever since this e-mail thing came out the phone's been ringing nonstop.
someone put a pile of dog feces on my doormat this morning.
Mrs. Nelson, did your husband teach anywhe else where he might've been in contact with younger boys?
after school program? The local Y?
look, I'm just going to say this once.
Vince was a normal guy. Okay?
a normal, boring, regular guy.
he watched football in his underwear.
he never took out the garbage unless I told him to.
he forgot our anniversary year after year and tried to make up for it two days later with a, with a bouquet of white roses.
but I didn't care, because he loved me.
Mrs. Nelson, was there anybody on the wrestling team that your husband seemed especially close to?
anyone he saw outside of practice or talked about more than any of the others?
no.
did he seem to have a problem with any of the boys on the team?
look, just because he worked with boys doesn't mean that...
I don't know why I don't just unplug it.
I guess I keep hoping one of these times it'll be someone with something comforting to say!
I-I'm so sorry. We're almost done here.
I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, poor woman. How could she possibly deny the fact that her husband was a pedophile?"
we have these pictures. This e-mail.
well, Vince wasn't a pedophile.
he was a loving, innocent man who was murdered.
why don't you put your energy into finding his killer?
the photos of the boy were downloaded from an international child porn site.
which makes it unlikely that Nelson actually molested him.
I checked the browser and search histories on his computer, there were no additional pornography downloads or searches, not one.
maybe he covered his tracks? Surfed anonymously?
no. The hard drive's clean.
the strange thing is when I checked the firewall log.
I did find a breach on the same day the photos were downloaded.
I'm thinking someone could've pirated his signal.
the alligator blood Stella found puts him on Nelson's roof.
maybe that's what he was doing up there.
okay, so Fleming downloads the photos of the boy, and makes it looks like Coach Nelson sent them.
I mean, it's possible, but why?
clearly, Fleming wanted to discredit Nelson.
making a coach look like a pedophile, that'll do it.
nothing. Nothing.
Nelson's apartment.
stell and Lindsay found the alligator blood over here.
okay, maybe something.
I'm getting a list of networks, but nothing strong enough to connect to.
it means we're in the vicinity.
okay, I've got several network choices now.
signal looks like it's strongest in this direction.
got one Wi-Fi network that's fully unprotected, no password, nothing-- genius.
look what it's called.
Vince N. Wireless Network.
so all Fleming had to do from here was to release a prewritten script to Nelson's computer, turning it into a zombie.
giving him complete control.
the e-mail connects to the murder, I just can't figure out how.
Yeah, well, we know Fleming didn't kill Nelson. He had an alibi.
right, but Coach Nelson's wife said she saw two people up here.
he might've had some help.
there's sawdust over here.
Sid found sawdust on the victim.
but Stella and Lindsay would've found the sawdust when they were here.
not necessarily.
I got good news and I got good news. Which one you want first?
whatever's faster.
all right, the sample of sawdust from the roof is identical to the sample we found in Coach Nelson's chest hairs.
and I finally determined the species it came from.
fagus Sylvatica.
beech Willow Tree.
which is indigenous to Flushing, Queens.
could be where our killer lives.
or just where he set up his chop shop.
see if anyone who got that e-mail hails from Flushing.
got ya.
three count, buddy. You lose.
high school wrestling team?
four older brothers. Come on.
whoa, Coach Nelson.
what happened to his neck?
it was separated from his body.
and the rest of him was stuffed in garbage cans all over the city.
whoa, wait, you think I had something to do with this?
we found sawdust on his torso.
sawdust from a tree indigenous to Flushing, Queens.
so?
you're the only kid on the wrtling team who is from Flushing, Queens.
we found that same sawdust on Coach Nelson's roof.
you were up there, weren't you with Todd Fleming?
no.
you leeched off his Wi-Fi signal, sent out the incriminating photos of the young boy.
right, when the coach found out about it, he came to you, and what'd you do?
I-I didn't kill Coach Nelson.
Todd Fleming had an alibi for the night Nelson was killed, which leaves you.
okay! Okay...
Yes, we sent the e-mail, okay?
I'll admit that.
Yeah. Nice.
see, my-my dad, he doesn't make a lot of money.
so the only way I'm going to college is if I get a wrestling scholarship.
coach Nelson, he moved me up a weight class.
that totally wrecked my chance at State Championship.
so we thought if we sent these pictures around, maybe it'll get him fired.
so you e-mailed them to yourselves to throw off suspicion?
Yeah, but that's all we did, okay? We had nothing to do the murder.
Ah, you know what, actually, you kind of did.
cause we're thinking it's those pictures that got your coach killed.
where were you Thursday night?
I was at, uh, school.
I was at a basketball game.
got somebody who can vouch for that?
Yeah, yeah. My, my-my, my Dad. He picked me up around 10: 00.
what's his name?
he works at the Manhattan Superior Court. He's a court officer.
he was struck by something hard, a club or a pipe.
it wasn't the son, it was the father.
court officers have metal batons.
I'm thinking that's what made the bruise on Vince Nelson's throat.
so the father was snooping on the son's computer, saw an e-mail from Coach Nelson...
assumed Nelson sent it. - And confronted him.
the problem is, in order for Johnny Holt's blood to get on Sheridan' baton, they would have to have contact at some point.
right, and that blood is more than three months old, and Holt was still in prison.
let's check it.
prison transfer log from Sing Sing.
here we go, three months ago Holt was taken from Sing Sing to Manhattan Superior Court.
for one day to testify as a witness in a trial.
there must've been some sort of altercation in that courthouse.
that would explain how Holt's blood got on Sheridan's baton.
all right, let's go. Move it, scumbag.
time to get a warrant to search Alex Sheridan's house.
Kyle's whole life was wrestling.
he was 14 when he made the team.
that was the happiest day of his life.
gave him confidence, discipline, a sense of belonging...
I wanted to pin a medal on Coach Nelson.
but when I saw that e-mail, those disgusting photos...
that knocked the breath right out of me.
I picked up the phone and told him I was going to notify the school the very next morning.
so Nelson came to your house to try to settle things in person.
Yeah, except all he did was deny it, said he'd never seen the photos, had no idea where they came from.
see, no one is guilty these days.
everyone's an innocent victim.
I was not about to let my son become a victim.
I fought back.
so what was I going to do?
I see these perverts every day.
they waltz into my court.
they get a slap on the wrist, and then they go off and re-offend.
the only treatment for them is death.
you dismembered him to make it easier to dispose of the body.
I've worked in a courtroom for 16 years.
tough to get a conviction without a body.
there's only one problem.
Vince Nelson didn't send those photos.
I don't understand. I saw them.
they were there with his name on my son's computer.
your son, Kyle sent them.
to himself and six other boys on the wrestling team.
he blamed the coach for ruining his chances at the state championship.
sending the photos from Nelson's e-mail address was his way of getting revenge.
he wanted to get the coach fired.
this whole thing was just a tragic misunderstanding.
wrestle!
you got him!
the Sound Of White -by Missy Higgins
you going somewhere, Don?
Yep, there is no point in me hanging around pushing papers.
it's not my style, Mac.
you've been cleared.
I just heard.
I want you to know, I never doubted you. - Thanks.
you know, for a long minute there, it felt like everybody else did.
Todd Fleming's medical records show that he was prescribed an anti-depressant eight months ago.
when Sid did a screen for that particular drug, he found more than ten times the recommended dosage in his system.
enough to cause the seizure?
found an empty prescription bottle in his locker at school.
I stood by the door while he got changed.
that's the only time he was alone.
God, what a waste.
seems to be a lot of that in this case.
you know, the Rangers are playing tonight.
we could catch thehird period at that new sports bar on Lafayette.
I didn't know you liked hockey.
I don't.
let's talk a little more about your followers.
what do you think draws them here, to you?
they come because they want to belong.
to be a part of the unconditional love, the acceptance that I offer.
I offer them my family.
Billy, what do you say to critics who accuse you of preying on individuals at their most vulnerable?
I don't prey on anyone.
I seek out no one.
I hear from every tiny, grim little corner of the world.
it is they who are seeking.
seeking connection.
which I provide.
come on, Kelly. Even if this place is Billy's, it doesn't mean he has your sister or her son.
well, if Billy didn't take Meadow, then who did?
what was it that latest vic kept repeating...
before he died? It was really weird. He said, "These things snap off." What things?
no... no, no, that wasn't it; Not exactly.
it was, "Well, hey, these things just snap right off.
Billy Grimm and his wack jobs are always spouting some nonsense, like they're revealing secrets to the universe.
with Billy, every word means something.
like that map.
he wants me out here tonight.
he's never forgiven me for leaving him.
I've seen that car at Billy's compound.
Kelly, don't make this personal.
that's definitely the work of Billy's followers.
I'm calling for backup.
phones won't work out here.
that's why Billy chose it.
cover me!
come on! Come on!
it's Meadow's husband.
Douglas, Douglas, where's Meadow?
Where's my sister? Where's Meadow and Andy?
it was Billy Grimm's people, wasn't it?
where did they take them?
well, hey... these things just snap right off.
Oh, dude, Douglas is dead!
cult's got him now.
all right, everybody, another great episode of Cult.
don't forget tomorrow is viewer's choice at the Fan?? Domain Caf?? so get your votes in now.
Merriam! - Nate? What?
I've... unlocked it.
the man in the wall... that's the clue I needed.
Seriously?
next level?
you can reach them?
I think so.
what are you doing? - It's just...
go home to your husband.
Mr. Fisher.
morning, Skye. You're in early this morning.
Yeah, I've got some research on blood splatter patterns
I need to get to the art department.
how's the job working out for you?
second week and I couldn't be happier.
glad you're happy.
Hey, Mike. - Morning, Gary.
numbers were good last night.
something else?
well, actually, yeah.
I was surfing the Web last night, checking out sites devoted to the show, the ones made by the fans...
our fans put up some wild stuff.
Yes. Most of the fan sites are amazing and cool and fun.
but then there are...
the other ones.
what other ones?
the ones that you find if you follow certain links.
the ones that actually make it hard for you to find them.
we put up all sorts of special Web content specific...
Yeah, no, I'm not talking about the official sites.
the people that posted these hard-to-get-into sites, they seem to have some sort of...
of special connection to the show.
some of them actually seem kind of...
scared.
scared?
scared of what exactly?
the show.
other fans.
maybe both. I'm not really sure.
I just thought...
you know, we might want to know a little bit more about these...
Skye, we're just a television show. They're just fans.
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
good. Good, good. - And I got research and blood splatter and...
Yeah.
come on, Bert,
I wrote it the way you wanted me to... with that sunshine in every line, relaxed kind of feeling.
you wrote it like you're still covering D. C. for the Post.
there are political reasons why the parking in this town is all screwed up, Bert, and you know that.
Jeff, The Word isn't the same paper anymore.
I only added two paragraphs.
I only cut two paragraphs.
Hey, Nate.
Jeff! Thank God I got you. Where are you, man?
what's the matter, Nate?
I'm... still freaking out here a little.
definitely freaking out.
come on, man. I thought we talked about this.
I have to see you.
you should be at work. - Jeff, for God's sakes, you got to meet me.
someplace public.
at the diner.
promise me you'll come.
come on, man. You're my brother.
okay.
half hour.
all right, man, I don't want to get you mixed up in this.
I really don't. I swore I wasn't gonna come to you again.
not like this. But this is... different.
Nate, damn it, I... - I know you did your part...
more than your part...
after Mom and Dad died.
you are 20 years old.
when I was your age, I was in college.
I had... - I'll never be you...
don't say that.
that's not what I meant.
it's just that I have my own problems these days.
I... I know. Your... your job and...
Brenda. - Brenda's over.
just tell me what the problem is, Nate.
you have no idea how much I don't want I don't want to get you mixed up in...
I made contact with them last night, and I think they're after me now.
who's after you? - Uh...
wait, don't tell me, don't tell me...
no, it's not that. I'm totally clean.
I swear.
then what is it?
a... a TV show...
and I know how this sounds...
it's called Cult.
Oh, man...
cult? - But it's not just a TV show.
it goes... beyond that.
way... beyond that.
that car.
Yeah, what about it?
please help me get away from this.
from a TV show?
I even tried contacting the people who make the show.
nobody would talk to me.
Nate, when I came back from D. C. we agreed things between us would be different, okay? Now, call me crazy, but I was hoping that I'd actually get just...
a little support from you. Just a little, Nate.
just let me explain.
no, Nate. - Yeah, yeah, it's...
no. You see, I have been through these obsessions of yours before, and I'm not gonna do it.
I... if anything happens to me, find Merriam.
talk to Merriam. - Merriam?
geez.
what the hell are these?
just take them.
please?
you're killing me.
you really are, Nate.
look, I'd love to come, but I'm still working.
how can you still be working?
come on, Skye, it's gonna be a great party.
not tonight. There's still some stuff here that I want to do.
tell me this isn't about those fan Web sites. You're obsessing!
I'm not obsessed. I'm just...
interested.
they're not fans. They're freaks.
once again, you're gonna miss a great party.
at this point, a minimal, small chance, but we do have a shot at rain.
mostly likely, it'll be Sunday night into Monday morning.
so, don't worry. Your weekend plans are not going to be ruined by this.
but it is going to cool us down and give us cloudy skies.
Hey, you!
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
my name is Billy.
people say I'm dangerous.
me?
I'm completely harmless.
as for my followers... well, I can't always vouch for them.
and they seem to be everywhere.
some at your work, neighbors, your friends.
maybe in your very own family.
and you know what?
it could just be that you're next.
all new episodes this week on the CW.
Hello?
hello - Jeff?! Jeff, listen!
Hey, Nate?
Hey, this connection sucks.
I have... ... warn you!
Hey, where are you? - Will... be... just... right off.
what? - Hey, these things just snap right off.
this is Nate. Leave a message.
Nate, are you here?
not Nate...
listen, he called me around, uh, 11: 00. It... it was a bad connection. He was...
he was really freaked out.
and then, the called ended, and...that area clear.
it was cut off. I... - So, you think the call was cut off?
it could have been. I... I really don't know.
but there's no sign of forced entry, or any aggressive contact.
the blood is contained, there's no splatter, so...
I'm a reporter, okay?
my first job out of college was covering homicide in Boston.
look, when are you gonna get the DNA back on that blood, so we know whether it's Nate's or not?
soon enough.
you and your brother get along?
fine. We get along just fine.
look, my brother was capable of getting caught up in some really screwy things, all right?
when I talked to him earlier today, he was convinced people were after him.
and he kept talking about this TV show. - Hey, Lieutenant?
lookie, lookie.
found it behind a heating grat ein the bedroom.
your brother into street pharmaceuticals, Mr. Sefton?
listen, he's been clean for over a year, okay?
I don't know what that is. Maybe it's a stash he forgot about.
pissed-off drug dealers love to leave messages.
this is not about drugs.
then what?
you turn this on?
no.
it was on when I came in.
it's playing something he recorded.
ignoring your captain's warnings about not harassing me?
where are they, Billy?
I heard about your missing sister and her son.
how very distressing that must be for you. - It was your people, wasn't it?
Joey Keller and his group?
Joey took my sister to protect you. To get me to stop.
Joey knows you made me your very own little personal cop mission.
Joey took them because he'll do anything you say.
just as you used to.
you came to me at 17.
I was always there for you.
you were obsessed with me then, and you're obsessed with me now.
because I know what you're capable of.
Joey will return my family, if you tell him to.
Joey is very loyal, but you have no idea how many followers are out there now.
what you have to understand is, even I have no idea the full number.
this is between you and me, Billy.
don't make my family a part of it.
I sincerely wish you all the luck in the world finding them.
take them.
you never know when something like these might come in handy.
Marc, what are you saying?
it's all about the numbers, my friend. Only the numbers.
our audience is crazy passion. - Oh, sure. Sure, sure, sure.
the network loves the fan passion. - Yeah?
loves it.
look, admittedly, I'm new to the network and new to the show, but at Fox, I was the guy who kept Grass on the air for more than one season, and...
and I've got some definite ideas on how to course-correct Cult - so it doesn't just end up a cult show. - A cult show. Look, Marc?
you know Steven, you know how he works.
you buy a show like this, you're buying one man's vision.
especially on this show.
I know. Steven's got this whole man-of-mystery, - never-seen-in-public thing. - Correct.
but it would be in everyone's best interest for Steven to hear what I have to say.
and the sooner, the better.
I'll pass that on.
Oh, uh, uh, tell Steven that I definitely look forward to getting creative with him.
creative? Good.
I must say, Mr. Sefton, I'm so glad The Post is willing to give a close look at our show.
Oh, well, I'm happy to do it.
I'm particularly interested in the show's impact on the people who watch it.
Oh, our fans are the greatest.
word of mouth on the show is fabulous.
makes my job as a publicist so much easier.
are you aware of any particular... influence, you know, the show has, beyond the show itself?
beyond the show? I'm not sure what you mean.
maybe if I could talk to Steven Rae.
Ann here tried to send you some promotional materials, but the Washington Post e-mail on your business card is no longer valid, so she called the Post.
you don't work for the Post anymore.
look, I'm sorry, but I just need a few minutes to speak to Mr. Rae about his show.
you damn fans will do absolutely anything to try and get to Steven.
call security, get them here now. - Listen, I honestly could give a damn about the show.
it's my brother who's the fan, and he's...
he's gone missing.
it's a new one.
handle this.
quite a hurry there, friend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Uh, excuse me. Hey.
I heard what you said about your brother.
Jerry? - Yeah? - She's over here.
come on. In here.
is this all for the show? - Yeah. You don't watch?
no. My brother does. Apparently... a lot.
and he's disappeared?
Yeah. So, you... you work on Cult?
Yeah, researcher. - Well, then you might know.
I mean, is there any reason for me to believe that my brother's disappearance is related to this show?
when I last talked to my brother, he was scared, and according to him, it had everything to do with this show.
I, uh...
I hung on to his phone. I... I thought there might be something, but all the calls and texts have been deleted.
can I?
see, delete doesn't mean permanent, not if you know what you're doing.
I used to work on a Bruckheimer show.
who's Meadow?
recent call history and texts all from somebody named Meadow.
where are you? Call me. Don't do this.
you don't know what they'll do to you.
who the hell is Meadow?
well, there's a character on the show, the sister of the main character... her name is Meadow.
she's missing, too.
look... I'm all my brother has.
if I don't try to find him, nobody will.
look, there's a place that you might want to check out.
I can show you.
come on.
the Fan Domain?
it's where fans come to watch their favorite shows.
especially Cult.
so, what is it about this show that has everyone so...
hooked?
it's not like any other show. It totally gets under your skin.
come on. The hard-core fans are this way.
what exactly are they doing here?
watching.
looking for clues, connections.
they believe there are messages coded in the show, that there's this whole other level of mystery thing that the fans love.
what kind of mystery thing, exactly?
that's my brother.
he's dressed like a... - Billy Grimm guy.
Hey, Skye.
what was it you said about this green dress again?
it's meant to be like the dress worn by the character Meadow in the show...
she was wearing it when she was abducted.
one second. Nate said if something happened to him I needed to find someone named Merriam.
what are you looking for? - Role players.
web sites devoted to fans who dress up like the characters.
and they like to get together, have these events. It's... all extremely underground.
damn it, Joey, where is my sister!
where is she?
if Billy knew that you found me, He's gonna be mad at me, really... mad.
I'll see that you're protected. - You'll...
protect me... from Billy?
what have you done with my sister and her son?
storage shed.
myers Woods.
I've been to that shed, and they're not there.
but you didn't really see!
you know Billy.
you need to look beyond what's right in front of you...
or you will never find his answers.
I don't want Billy mad at me.
Joey, don't! No!
I got it.
Wh... what is it? - A site dedicated to role players.
they're talking about an event. - Yeah, a role-playing event.
it's going on right now.
where are you going?
I'm going with you.
Really? - You kidding?
so, you are a reporter?
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh. My father was a newsman.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, but not in print; He worked in television.
Ah. He worked the local news here in Los Angeles.
Oh, yeah. I remember him. He was good.
I remember something about him around the time I was going to college.
Yeah, I was still in high school.
he was working on a story on union corruption.
everybody told him to back off, but my dad?
no way.
and then one night...
he just didn't come home.
never was a clue to what happened to him.
to this day, my mom and I don't know if he's alive or...
I know what it's like to have somebody you love go missing.
we're here.
this is from the show.
I remember when we shot out here.
now! Come on!
get out of my way!
go! Let's go!
Hello?
is everything okay in here?
leave me alone!
we don't know you.
who are you? I don't know you!
merriam, my name is Jeff Sefton. I think you know my brother; My brother, Nate?
how can we help you?
nobody can help me.
do you know where Nate is?
merriam, is he all right?
he's not all right.
I never should have gotten involved in any of this.
they'll be coming for me next.
Oh, God... Oh...
who? Who will be coming for you?
well...
hey...
these things just snap right off.
I just told you.
her name is Merriam and she knew my brother.
and she killed herself? - Right in front of us. Yes.
and your brother knew this Merriam because they... ?
because they watched this... this...this show together.
the victim's husband...
we asked him about this television show of yours.
it's not mine.
he said his wife never watches TV.
well, he's lying.
maybe he watches, too.
listen, I know how this sounds, okay?
but I am telling you, there is a connection between this show and what just happened.
Yes, you are telling me all of this.
and I have a big problem with that.
you used to work for The Washington Post.
a reporter.
very well regarded. A real comer.
that is, until they fired you.
you lied on a story, just completely fabricated the source.
six decent cops went to jail because of that story.
they went to jail and they're still in jail because they're dirty.
but in order to get that story, you lied.
and now here you are with a missing brother, a woman with a bullet in her skull, and you're telling me everybody else is lying.
listen...
everything she said about my story about the cops...
you don't owe me any explanations.
what was it that Merriam said, something about things snapping off?
well, hey these things just snap right off.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Yeah, my brother said the same thing.
that's from the show.
thanks for everything.
you sure know how to show a girl an interesting time.
the essence of simplicity.
all these you see living here now, they're just the tip of the iceberg.
I've been to that shed, and they're not there.
but you didn't really see!
you know Billy.
you need to look beyond what's right in front of you...
or you will never find his answers.
forensics was all over this place...
if your sister was here, they would've found something.
come on, Kelly, this is crazy.
look beyond what's right in front of you.
what do you see?
auntie Kelly. - Come here.
it's not Meadow.
Billy Grimm likes his boxes; That body was in a box.
it's a barrel, it's not a box.
Billy's far more precise than that.
whether it was Billy or not, it's our case now.
just give it to someone else.
captain assigned it to us.
can't. Meadow's still out there.
this is our case.
Yeah. Yeah, I told you, I'm on it.
what?
Yeah, yeah, you should see all the crazy fans out here.
if Steven would just listen to me, the show would be huge.
Yeah, I... I put Fisher on notice.
there's a new marshal in town.
that's great. Back to one, let's take it from Colin's first line.
reset the body.
uh, yeah, this is Skye.
Jeff, hi.
any word from Nate?
Yeah, I could probably get away. Why? What...
I'll be right there.
hello. Yo. What's up?
Yup, I'll see you at the club in an hour.
all right, here we go. Ready?
and, same place, and...
action.
so, tell me.
well, dead less than 24 hours.
massive blood loss.
blood drained out pretty fast.
didn't happen here, though.
lots of blood at the missing kid's apartment this morning, too.
the DNA came back on that.
the blood in the chair wasn't the kid's.
could be this guy's.
could be.
something tells me the older brother...
the reporter...
is gonna connect to all of this.
Oh, thank God you're here.
listen...
I'm really sorry I keep involving you in this.
I'm already involved.
so, where is it?
Nate hid it in a place he knew only I would find.
so... what's on the disc Kelly finds on the show?
when Kelly puts it in, it...
co-opts her computer.
uploads all of her personal information.
it lets Billy Grimm's people totally hook into her life.
then what?
nobody knows, Steven hasn't sent us that part yet.
he's the one I have to get to.
you'll never get to Steven.
watch me.
is this Nate?
Yeah.
what is that?
what do you see?
it's, uh, it's a bunch of blank spaces.
what was it Nate said, again?
well, hey, these things just snap right off.
you sure that you want to do this?
whatever it's gonna do... let it.
Hello? - Jeff?
Jeff, it's me. It's Nate.
thank God. All you all right?
you put in the disc? - Yeah.
how did you know?
where are you, Nate?
I had no idea what it really meant.
you never should have put it in.
tell me where you are.
walk away, Jeff.
whatever you do, do not try to find me.
don't even think...
look at it.
you're next. You're next.
you're next... next...
next... next... next...
my name is Billy.
people say I'm...
dangerous.
Goa! Paradise on Earth.
but every Paradise.
has a few snakes.
the biggest snake around here.
michael Barbossa
my name is Lawrence. Eduardo. Gomes.
but everyone calls me Lorry!
at 17, my life ran in two straight lines.
from college to the football field and from there to Tani!
looks like the goal keeper is going to score tonight!
shut up! One track mind
Hello, you dived on me!
so excited! You wanna molest me or what?
dream on dude. I'm excited about this, idiot!
shit! You got into the university? - Yes!
and with a full scholarship!
no way. - Get up!
the postman must be headed to your place. Get up!
mama!
lorry!

did I get in? - Open it!
I can't, mama, you do it.
Oh Lord.
Oh Jesus. - Yes!
you got in Lorry!
congratulations my dear.
aunty, we're out of toilet paper in room number four.
use this!
lorry.
listen to me.
lorry?
why are you getting angry at me?
it's not my fault.
so is it my fault?
I need the scholarship, while you get it!
that's not fair.
it's really not fair!
it hurts me the most that you didn't get the scholarship.
and you're being such a jerk?!
go to hell, Lorry.
tani, I'm sorry. Don't. Don't cry!
it's not about university.
I care a damn about the scholarship!
it's about us, Tani.
I mean.
you in the US, and me here.
it's pretty much over, isn't it? - What nonsense, Lorry!
four years will be over in the blink of an eye!
just like that. We won't even know it.
and then I'll be back. - You won't!
you'll stay back for two more years for your Master's.
and then a job!
and then a green card. Then marriage.
to you! Just in case you've forgotten.
I'll miss you a lot.
the Goa Chief Minister has waved his magic wand!
assistant Commissioner of Police, Vishnu Kamath, is appointed to head the Goa narcotics bureau.
why do you look like 17 going on 70, sweetheart?
Tani's gone. To the US.
so come to Moscow!
Moscow?
there's a Russian party tomorrow. Sex on toast, dude!
djs from Moscow will spin some great music.
and all the Moscow pussy cats will be running wild!
live FTV, no censor!
lorry, what's your experience with foreign tongues?
english, obviously.
and some Portuguese swear words thanks to Granny!
why are you asking?
meet my friend, Rozanna.
trust me, this is the best foreign tongue you'll ever experience!
isn't this music great?
goalkeeper, time to score?
man, I can't hear a word she says between the music and the accent!
you don't understand? - What are you doing?
you're a big boy now!
sir, please buy something.
sir.
get lost! - Rozanna?
Rozanna is allergic to sunlight, sweetheart.
Ricky?
so you got admission, but no scholarship!
how do you know?
I know the color and size of your boxers too!
here.
tell me.
once upon a time.
that's great! Laugh at my misery!
you call that misery?
be a man!
think of your predicament as a woman and just give it to her!
easier said than done!
your problem is nothing!
I'll get you 15, 000 dollars in two clicks!
15, 000 dollars? - Just like that!
forget it, Ricky. I don't want to get into your schemes.
listen.
my schemes make millions!
and your task is practically peanuts!
listen, it's very simple.
you need a career, and I need a carrier.
what? You're crazy, man!
that's illegal, I can't do it.
you know what the most illegal thing is?
being a middle class schmuck like you.
Ricky, the cops, the airport authorities, carriers are all in your pocket.
why are you after me?
my love, you've got a US university admission letter.
they're laying down the red carpet for you man!
you won't even be checked, you'll clear the customs, nice and smooth.
with that letter, you're as good as President Obama.
everybody loves you!
so, you keep the letter.
and give you 15, 000 dollars just like that?
why not? - Get lost you middle class loser!
listen, Mrs Dsouza expects
Mr. Dsouza to be in her bed on their wedding night, right?
but what if Mr. Pereira lands up there instead?
kick in the ass, man!
it's your admission letter, so only you can go.
and I'll go to jail too, right?
the law loves you too!
you may be a man to Rozanna.
but you're under 18, a minor.
the police can't touch you.
Hey.
I'm going for a walk.
Ricky.
sorry, man, I can't do this.
get lost!
go on, go home.
this playground isn't meant for kids like you. - Baby, what happened? - Just cheer me up.
we're living everyday, we're dying everyday.
lorry.
let him stew a bit.
wait till his brain moves to between his legs then we've got him.
you mean from here to there.
Hey, loser, why are you here?
this is the deep end. Go play in the kiddies pool.
Ricky, I've been thinking.
middle class or business class? Are you in or out?
you're connected in India.
even if l get through the customs here, what about the US?
they'll check my bags there, right?
when your bags go missing, what will they check?
drugs flow everywhere, like the blood in your veins.
by the time you get back your bags,
the stash would have reached every corner of New York.
and you'll be in Tani's arms!
not only do you get 15, 000 dollars, you'll get airline compensation as well.
you'll be swimming in dollars, you lucky bloody rascal.
are you in,
or are you out?
Victor。
he is in.
great, that's good.
an X-ray machine too.
Where's Ricky? I've been trying to reach him.
Ricky's job is done.
he's recruitments.
I'm sales.
and you boy, you're exports.
hello. It's Ricky.
Pedro is going to deliver.
Ricky,
he peddles drugs in the church as well?
Yeah, I'm near him, will get the goods out from him.
michael Barbossa.
who is Michael Barbossa? Your boss? Meeting him here?
what did you hear? Tell me.
nothing. Ricky.
you slimy rat! Sneaking behind my back!
I swear l. - Trying to act smart, eh?
I just asked who Michael Barbossa was, I'm sorry.
you better erase that name from your memory.
I mean it!
I'll twist you so hard, you'll be less of a man.
got it?
shit! You nearly gave me a heart attack.
where did you and Ricky disappear?
missed me?
are you going to the US as well?
no, Thailand.
I just came here to say bye - my way.
what are you doing? Not here!
come on, Lorry!
it's just a parting gift.
I'm sorry. I can't.
the past few days, the fun we had.
it's not the real me.
it was just a, bad dream.
now, I need to focus on my future University and Tani.
I'm such a fool.
you don't understand a word I'm saying!
you won't get it.
I get it.
now that's something to remember you by.
Yeah, he is fine.
I'm ACP Vishnu Kamath.
35 years old.
enlisted in the year 2000.
five years ago.
I was the most celebrated，
active and dangerous officer of the narcotics squad.
and also the most corrupt!
I worshiped Gandhi.
not his ideals - but his face on the bank notes!
Raj!
I love you, mom.
love you!
I was on the take - from everyone.
but why?
simple - for my family.
just like every other husband and father.
I wanted to give my family Paradise on earth.
I gave them Paradise alright!
I was on the take from everyone.
but little did I know that when you sell your soul.
life gives it back to you with a vengeance.
drink?
my heart's a mess. Nine blockages. This big!
surgery is in two days.
may as well indulge till then!
why did you call me, sir?
here, look at this.
take a good look.
take any damn newspaper.
it's either rape,
or tourists being murdered,
or prostitution!
the one thing responsible for this - drugs, drugs drugs!
it's come to a head. Time to clear this mess.
vishnu, the doctors will clear the mess in my heart.
but this mess in Goa.
you will clear it.
sounds to me like you're clearing your conscience.
ever since your party came into power.
the partying has been on full swing.
a nonstop party!
Hey. Mind your tongue!
sir, I told you. This guy is useless.
you may leave.
not you. sit.
but, sir. I.
why me, sir? Why did you pick me?
after all, you have a personal bond with drugs, Vishnu!
if I dive into this gutter, I'll do it with a big splash.
and it will splash on all of us!
and then, the phones won't stop ringing from here to Delhi!
phones don't ring in the ICU!
don't worry, I'm an old hand at this game.
alright sir!
I'll play your game - but by my rules and with my players.
and no referee!
done!
I'll take that drink now.
job hasn't even started and you're back to your old self?
Ah, the easy life!
it's a rule, sir. I only drink when I'm on duty.
same reason the sewage worker does.
only way to handle the stink!
sir, I'm Sub-Inspector Mercy Dcosta.
thank you for making me a part of your team.
your name caught my attention. Mercy!
mercy as in compassion, forgiveness pity?
actually, when I was born.
I was very huge, round like a football.
my mother was in labor for 18 hours. And she kept screaming, God, please spare me. Mercy, mercy!
unfortunately, God didn't answer her prayers.
hence, my father thought it was the best name!
in two weeks, every drug dealer will scream your name.
thank you, sir.
my name is Sandesh Rane.
and my mother is still alive, then why did you select me?
I like your work.
thank you, sir.
as I was leaving home today, I told my wife,
to hammer a nail in the wall.
for my medal.
because very soon someone will nail me!
in the last 15 years, there hasn't been another cop,
who knows the Drug Mafia better.
nails will be hammered - into the coffins of those criminals.
guaranteed!
the drug syndicate in Goa is international in nature.
this area is fully Russians!
it's a mini Stalingrad, sir.
the Israelis operate in this area.
but they've been low-key after the Mumbai terror attacks.
nobody knows what's in store for them.
here the Nigerians don't have the same control as some years ago.
but over here they rule the place.
this area is mainly British.
while this is French.
this, right here, is our area!
finally - an area the cops control!
not the cops - Goan mafia sir. Our local boys.
this is a political game.
the minister Ponda is using you.
he is using you as his fangs but it's not easy to bite into Biscuit!
biscuit?
he is too powerful.
he will chew all of us for breakfast!
please put your hands together to welcome.
the pride of Goa.
Mr. Lorsa Biscuita.
I've heard that these days, celebrities, VIPs.
charge for their presence.
I am neither a celebrity nor a VIP.
in fact my company has completely funded this de-addiction center.
but, I will take a price!
from each one of you present here today.
I shall cut this ribbon.
but we can only cut out drugs if we come together.
I'm a businessman, and my aim is to make profits.
for the first time, I want to suffer a loss in my business why?
because I'm a Goan fiirst, and a businessman later.
now, that's what you call a true businessman.
he earns from the supply of drugs, from the sale of drugs.
and if you want to kick the habit he'll make money out of that too.
now, he also has a stake in death.
I've heard he is setting up an electric crematorium.
hotels, shipping, mining, real estate, drugs.
he has a finger in every pie!
we have this joke in Goa.
nobody here is homeless, cause Biscuit has everyone in his pocket!
I've nothing on me now.
I'm clean.
you're clean?
it's a shit job!
what do we do with this?
we secure the future of your kids!
we're going to sell it?
no, use it to buy them a ticket home!
return to sender.
bullshit. You've got nothing on me!
what about this? - Shit!
mercy, his fingerprints are on the packet.
it's not mine!
Goa jail for life or back to Moscow with wife?
wow, Mercy! This is great!
are you getting married to some minister's daughter?
sir, no marriage jokes, please!
they are from the tourism department.
and they've got a long trip scheduled for us.
relax, Mercy.
never take stress in life - just give it to others!
Hey, have you lost it?
if you continue to harass harmless tourists, you will ruin our economy.
shoot!
isn't this your daughter?
her face is a little out of focus, but the rest of her is pretty clear.
your harmless tourists and their stuff.
have ravaged your daughter.
so just let me do my job.
what's your name? - Pedro.
have I broken some traffic rules?
do I look like a traffic cop to you?
more than half your chickens are dead.
mercy.
shit job!
your kids?
Yes.
Francis and Nero. What's the matter, sir?
the kids will answer that question.
what's your mother's name?
Maria - Shantabai.
you practicing bigamy, eh?
you were absolutely right, sir.
I guess it's time to dig a grave for you, not the chickens!
only an idiot would try to ruin tourism
Russians, Israelis, Germans, British - come to Goa have a blast.
but drugs.
drugs won't be tolerated!
from now on all raves are banned!
where is Lorsa?
what the hell are you doing, Lorsa?
drugs worth 9. 7 billion rupees are stuck.
since the raves are canceled, the Russians can't peddle it.
they can't even smuggle out the drugs.
lorsa?
it's about time you silenced Kamath.
relax.
Zoe, just relax.
Damn!
Kamath. Kamath. Kamath.
everybody wants a piece of Kamath.
everybody wants Kamath, right?
here's ACP Kamath for you.
there's an old Goan proverb.
to kill a harmless mouse, a silly farmer burnt down his own house.
you're behaving in a similar way.
let Kamath make as much noise as he wants.
we have to keep our goods safe.
but where, where?
whenever our business has faced danger,
one man has always come to our rescue.
even today we can count on him.
he will take responsibility for our drugs.
Vincent Vega from Morjim?
no, the guy from Candolim, Colin Coutinho.
no, Toby Follet.
no.
now he has a new identity.
michael Barbossa
Barbossa?
michael Barbossa, from Vagator.
he will take responsibility for all our drugs.
and so,
our stash worth 9. 7 billion rupees,
is now guaranteed by Michael Barbossa.
relax, Pedro. Relax!
sir, what are you doing?
the same damn thing that you force the kids to do!
Hey, Mercy!
take off his pants.
sir. Sir.
shit job!
that's my favorite song.
this song plays where ever I go. The tune is great but.
I can't really get the lyrics.
what are the lyrics, Pedro?
who owns this stuff?
what's his name?
Michael.
Barbossa!
Pedro!
Cheers!
Rane.
either you're crooked or lazy.
which one are you?
michael Barbossa?
for all these years he has reigned as the drug kingpin in Goa.
yet we don't have a single file on him?
who said there's no file? Here it is!
all these years I've been working on these files.
look at this, Vincent Vega, Colin Coutinho and Michael Barbossa.
but every file is.
just empty!
nothing in it.
who the hell is this Michael Barbossa?
is he Indian, foreigner, a cop, a politician, who is he?
nobody knows a damn thing.
except Biscuit.
his words are obeyed by every Mafia ring leader in Goa!
he knows everything.
but nobody knows about him
he remains underground for years.
but when danger strikes the business.
he rises to the surface like a snake.
raises his hood.
bites and vanishes.
just like a snake sheds it's skin, he changes his name, where, about everything.
if anybody happens to see him or even mentions his name.
he doesn't survive.
here Pedro, have a drink.
who knows if you will live to see another day.
Kamath sir.
neither have I lost the will nor have I been bought.
I've just managed to survive!
and after slogging my ass off all these years, I have learnt.
who Michael Barbossa is.
he is a shadow.
try and catch a shadow.
a shadow confirms that a person is lurking nearby.
if you squeeze the man hard, even the shadow starts trembling.
time to squeeze Michael Barbossa.
and get the 9. 7 billion rupees.
we'll have the drugs and Barbossa in our grasp.
according to Pedro's tip off, some guy named Ricky,
was going to pick up the drugs.
I'll check inside.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to call a friend.
where is Ricky?
this trick comes really handy when my phone stops working.
Rane!
check the backyard.
well, it seems that he is in need of a coffin.
another one of Barbossa's prey.
every house says something about its owner.
what does this say about Ricky?
lucky bastard!
he was a lucky guy!
he is lying dead on a slab of ice.
and you call him lucky?
Oh come on!
everyone is destined to die.
but the life he lived,
was king-size!
that's true.
that too with a live-in girlfriend.
probably.
Brazilian.
even she was king-size.
cup size, 34 D!
it says so on the label and this is Brazilian too.
mercy, come here.
I am sure it's some shit job.
sir, you always give me the dirty stuff.
put this together. Let's see some magic.
the list of the flights on the 30th.
something is about to take off. Either dope or the girl.
what the hell is this about?
why you put me here?
Ricky?
Ricky? Who Ricky?
what are you talking about?
excuse me, why are you holding this girl?
Mr. Rane!
she has brains along with beauty.
she has deleted Ricky's number!
didn't find anything in her luggage.
put it through the X-ray four times
we could scan her stomach.
she was drinking coffee.
if she had swallowed a consignment she wouldn't have anything else.
the packet could burst inside her.
you're taking me in for what?
what have I done?
I demand to know why this girl is being victimised.
who the hell is he?
her father? - No, sir!
but he could be ours.
he's from the Brazilian government. And has a diplomatic passport.
we can't arrest her without any proof.
who is Ricky?
we, play football together.
do you know why his number is unavailable?
because the dead don't talk!
sir.
even this suitcase is clean.
his admission papers are in order.
he is the state topper from the college.
brilliant academic record!
what's this?
prawn pickle, my mom makes it.
your mom managed to pay the university fees.
all from a thriving pickle business, is it?
she used dad's savings and we also run a hotel.
sir, let him go.
he's headed to university, he seems to be clean.
you really think he is clean, Mercy?
he has Ricky's number.
while Ricky's girl has his picture.
and you say he's clean?
excuse me, sir!
we can't delay the flight any more.
police, police!
please, police!
police! Please help me!
police!
Yes, madam! I am the police - That man, my suitcase. - Relax, he is also police, madam.
Rane!
same brand, similar suitcase.
why is there a difference of two kilos?
now, you're in a pickle!
lawrence Eduardo Gomes!
sir, he is innocent. I can vouch for him.
you want to vouch for him? And six kilos of cocaine?
mercy, take him in too!

not there! Here!
Hey! Happy Birthday, Amit! Happy Birthday!
Hey! We thought that we will give him a surprise.
but he put on a mask on his face and surprised us.
happy Birthday, darling!
who are you!?
he is not Amit! - Who are you?
lf there are no notes crisp, then let it be lips.
what the hell? Stop him. Call the police please.
ten on nine.
ten on nine.
Hey, get in! - Lock it.
hey constable, l had asked you to get a person to massage my feet. Did you get him?
brother, if your neck is aching should l strangle it.
you! Once again you were caught stealing!
don't you feel ashamed?
great, you are saying as if the police has not arrested and got you here, but the jailor has called you for dinner.
you loot the snoozing people in the darkness of the night.
and here people give me their belongings in broad daylight.
just don't talk!
l loot people while snoozing or while awake.
we both have the same profession.
and after being caught the cell is the same.
you are a very bad omen.
since the day l know you, l have been caught 6 times.
do you understand?
l have to say this instead.
first you are caught then, l am caught.
then that makes you a bad omen for me, isn't it?
look, l immensely respect you or else!
or else, what? Or else, what?
Oh! No violence, brother. No violence.
fighting and quarrelling is not our job.
our job is the tact of hands.
remove your hands! Remove your hands!
my job is a brave one.
lf 20-50 people appear before me.
l have the strength to fight them.
not like you.
lf someone calls out to you as a thief in the night.
you flee like a rat.
and how much success have you achieved with your strength and daring?
look, there is only one difference between you and me.
you have a day shift and l have a night shift.
don't equate me with you. One day l will.
why should l tell you my plan?
brother, tell me what is the plan? Oh brother!
one day l will steal a big fish and leave far from here.
ls this a plan?
hey dear, destiny is not going to change by dreaming.
tell me some plan! Plan!
little brother, l am not dreaming.
l am waiting for that man.
and l am dreaming that when he will meet me and when will my luck shine.
who will be that man?
Pooja! l did not realise when you came.
and what was the reason to call me urgently.
the matter was such, uncle. By the way meet my friend Kim.
hello. - She stays in Mauritius.
and with her dad's help l am making a deal of a five star hotel there.
what? - Yes. They have given a time period of 90 days.
and within these 90 days we have to make a payment of 30 crores.
30 crores! But, from where will this money come?
l have called Gupta and got all the files checked.
sell all the properties here and in Goa and also the shares.
and give an advertisement in the newspaper tomorrow that we want to sell all our investments in the market.
you took such a big decision all on your own.
at least you should have called me up and asked for opinion and advice.
you know how much our restaurant is facing a loss.
knowing this l have taken this step.
actually, papa had built this hotel with great expectations.
and l do not want this hotel should shut down.
and as it is uncle, we will profit from the hotel in Mauritius that all the losses incurred here will be covered.
without wasting any time.
start meeting all the interested parties.
and get back to me. Come on Kim. - Bye.
what are you thinking, sir.
should l give an ad in tomorrow's newspaper?
this is my job. You go and do your job. - Which job, sir?
what is there in this hotel, to do a job?
soon this hotel is going to shut down.
what do you mean?
the investment which madam was talking about is not real.
and the land in Goa which she was talking is only sea.
and as for the shares of the company.
there is no such company in the market.
and if l tell this fact to madam, what will l get?
only a certificate as a first class employee.
what do you want?
nothing much, sir.
you have gulped crores of rupees by fraud.
l don't want a crore. Just a few lakhs.
you have Mercedes Benz. Maruti 800 is fine for me.
you have a grand bungalow. lf l were to get a flat.
you will get it.
sir, if l were to get something now as advance then.
you used to say that you handle the entire hotel business.
then since when did this girl start taking interest?
Diler, l myself didn't think that this girl will take interest in business.
l thought l will get her married.
l will shed crocodile tears and bid her farewell.
and later l will show her the business loss.
the hotel will shut down.
and with the money, l will settle down comfortably in my life.
but this girl came here and ruined everything!
Balram, how did you forget that business runs in that girl's blood?
we will think about Pooja later.
first think about that Gupta.
he is such a man that he can retaliate anytime.
and if it came to Pooja's knowledge.
before that we will make him mum. What's the bid deal?
conscience will sway.
conscience will sway.
Oh God! My tender youth.
Oh God! My tender youth.

brother, this man was talking about 30 crores.
l thought 15 will be mine and 15 will be yours.
brother. First time l have addressed you as brother.
look, if we commit small robberies.
we will receive imprisonment term of 14 days.
but this is a murder case.
we will have to remain in the prison for 14 years.

you don't have any other work. - Thank you.
ls your name Balram? - Yes.
bihar's minister wants to talk to you.

which minister are you?
fool! You don't recognise my voice?
my voice is more famous than Amitabh Bachchan.
sir! lt's you! Sir, tell me. Why did you call me?
l am sending a person to you. Get him a job.
girl? Sir, you are mistaken. l don't do such a job, sir.
you always think about girls! l am talking about job! Job!

no, l understood. l will get him a job, sir.
you are very sensible. Hail Bihar!
hail Maharashtra!
brother! You continue committing robberies.
l am going for 30 crores.
Jimmy. The number of people whom l have robbed exceeds your age.
what do you think? l will let go of 30 crores so easily?
till the time l don't have 30 crores, l will not live in peace.
Gupta's son. l have shaved off your head.
tell me. What's your father's name?
mother never told me my father's name.
you! Fine, l will tell you.
your father's name is Ram Prasad Gupta. What?

my father died! My father died!
Wow! Wow, dear! What fine acting!

Hey, Johnny! l am ready!
Wow! Wow! Hang on!

or to dance in Chandni Bar?
what do you mean?
l mean to say that you have to go as Gupta's widow.
and there you should act in such a way.
that everybody should think that you are Gupta's widow.
go and remove your makeup! Go!
my dear friends! lts very sad that today our hotel's accountant Mr. Gupta is not amidst us.
he died in a car accident. He died.
stop this charade!
by keeping quiet will Gupta's soul rest in peace?
will this widow get her husband back?
will this baldy get his father back?
why are you laughing? Keep quiet!
but who are these people?
she is Gupta's widow.
and this baldy is his son.
my father died! - No, dear! Keep quiet!
Gupta's widow?
how is this possible?
why not?
do you think that she has worn a white sari to do a washing powder's ad?
and this baldy has got a role in Chanakya serial?
no, this is not what l mean.
l mean to say that in our record. Gupta is not married.
many things are not recorded. Still they exist.
Gupta's marriage was performed covertly.
secret nuptial rounds.
what do you want?
who will bear their expenses? You only will have to do all that.
fine. l will do one thing.
l will give Gupta's widow his post.
for cabaret in the hotel?
this child is very sweet. l will give him a job.
you will make him clean vessels?
l will lock you up under child's act. Understand!
then whom should l give a job?
me. They both don't have anybody besides me.
she is my sister. And l am this baldy's uncle.
my father died! My father died! My father died!
dear, don't cry! Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't cry!

lf you said it once more, l will murder you! Come!
lts 5 o'clock. Everybody's work is over.
and my work has started.
he has made such a big cabin.
lf l start searching for the money, it will take me 1 month.
God, show me a miracle.
so that l get the money at the place that l touch with closed eyes.
hang on.
brother.
you! What are you doing here?
brother, if you will roam around like a blind man.
then forget 30 crores, you won't even get 30 cents.
what inauspicious time was it when l met you!
don't say inauspicious time.
lf God wants us to meet, then why don't we embrace?
get lost!
elder brother!
listen to me! You will embrace me?
what are you?
fine. l agree that you are smarter than me.
but remember! You are incomplete without me.
you need me. l don't need you. Understood!
closer, baby! Closer!
you need to use sleight of hand, not your power for such things.
ls that so?
what was this? The door screamed?
fool! The man who was inside, he screamed.
that's why l say no violence.
before our first day becomes our last day, let's run!
security!
Wow! You are great!
that is true!
Hey! Where are you barging in?
are you blind? This is a health club, isn't it?
so l will enter the health club.
this is the lady's time.
ls that so?
l can go wherever and whatever time l want.
l am a staff member.
you know since when l was trying to hit one ball.
but your one dash hit my 4 balls.
balls, ma'am?
Yes! Snooker!
ma'am, this game is nothing.
ln each game from the playground to love.
Jimmy always wins.
Jimmy! Hi! l am Kim!
you don't know who l am.
l know. You are a girl. You are beautiful and young.
just shut up! And get out of here!
slowly! There are other girls too.
why are you the only one who is yelling?
look, ma'am. Today you exercise for 2 hours.
swim for 1 hour. Your mind will calm down.
by the way the name of the hero of my novel is also Jimmy.
what do you do?
ma'am, just now you called me great.
lf l told you that, then in two minutes my grade will become low.
you must have recognized me from my appearance.
l am the waiter of this hotel.
lnsolent! l will get you sacked from the hotel.
ls that so! ls this your father's hotel?
or you are the owner of this hotel that you will get me sacked.
Yes. l am the owner of this hotel.
what happened? You became mum?
a person doesn't become small by doing a menial work.
for me you are always great.
l thought l am going to get into trouble. But the girl got enticed.
did you say anything?
me? No.
Jimmy, you are so sweet!
do me a favour. - Yes.
get a chicken sandwich and coke for me. Please. Thanks.
she brought me down to my status.
ma'am, do you know what l should say during such a situation?
what?
l am sorry. Forgive me.
who appointed an insolent man like you?
l am not insolent, ma'am. l am unlucky.
l have gone mad.
after brother-in-law's death, l am not in my senses.
brother-in-law?
Mr. Gupta, you accountant.
l am his brother-in-law.
l am tired of wiping his widow wife and orphan child's tears.
l mean, l am their sole means of livelihood.
their sorrow has troubled me so much, ma'am that l am not aware of what l am doing.
l am sorry.
lt's your first mistake. So l forgive you.
you have forgiven me, ma'am.
but how do l forgive myself? By touching your feet!
or my touching your hands or by embracing you?
l am having so much fun.
leave me! What are you doing!
did you see this, ma'am? l myself don't know what l am doing.
lf l stayed here for some more time.
then l don't know what all things l will touch.
lf you made this mistake again, l will sack you.
