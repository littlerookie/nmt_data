but maybe he just didn't want to be in a relationship with me.
but maybe he just likes throwing punches.
but maybe he just won't stop until he succeeds.

but maybe he planned for me to settle the score all along.
but maybe he should be.
but maybe he should.
but maybe he told his wife.
but maybe he was running away from what he did.
but maybe he was too close to heaven, because when I came to his town, he had already died, and they had buried him in the glove and jacket.
but maybe he was wrong.
but maybe he wasn't perfect.
but maybe he will die and these will be larger, his parents will find them and beat them and tell the teacher, maybe they will say that to the judge.
but maybe he'd rather just lie in bed with his girlfriend.
but maybe he'll feel differently when he finds out
but maybe he'll get us out of here!
but maybe he'll talk to family.
but maybe he's got that number disease where you hear...
but maybe he's more of a reliable witness than we realize.
but maybe he's right for you.
but maybe he's right.
but maybe he's still in the dark about what happened today.
but maybe he's the new defense suspect.
but maybe he's trying to draw attention away from here.
but maybe he's trying to get you and your wife back together.
but maybe he's your guy.
but maybe helping us find who took her away.
but maybe her ex-partner, Barnet, does.
but maybe his coming home will be what fixes things,
but maybe if I come clean and I tell her what we saw...
but maybe if I could get back to that parallel universe
but maybe if I do this, it will solve everything.
but maybe if he had have got caught,
but maybe if he knew about my powers,
but maybe if he knew what you do, he 'd...
but maybe if he were to hear it from family...
but maybe if some of that plaster got lodged in the saw,
but maybe if somebody else tried,
but maybe if we are careful.
but maybe if we have a hose, we can grow one.
but maybe if we show them some extra appreciation,
but maybe if we show them some extra appreciation, they might let us stay and party.
but maybe if we start over... Maybe the past won't be there in our next relationships.
but maybe if we tighten our belts, got second jobs, maybe -
but maybe if we tighten our belts,
but maybe if we...
but maybe if you could call back when -
but maybe if you give the D.A. The name of your surgeon he'll cut you a deal.
but maybe if you guys are getting called back to Iraq - Oh, stop using that!
but maybe if you hadn't spent so much money on coffee sleeves and new logos,
but maybe if you help us, we can cut you some slack.
but maybe if you join me...
but maybe if you learn to bend a little,
but maybe if you saved her from the big bad wolves,
but maybe in a - in a couple of weeks on my break.
but maybe in a - in a couple of weeks on my break. That would be fun.
but maybe in a year or so, we could reassess.
but maybe in ours.
but maybe in private would be better.
but maybe in the end it was a hollow victory.
but maybe instead of driving yourself crazy.
but maybe it could be better.
but maybe it didn't compromise the source.
but maybe it does a little bit for boys, maybe?
but maybe it doesn't bother you, why is that?
but maybe it doesn't matter.
but maybe it doesn't matter.
but maybe it had something to do with that woman
but maybe it is for someone younger and stronger than I to spread that word.
but maybe it is, and I - I can't get my heart broken again.
but maybe it is.
but maybe it just doesn't like the cold.
but maybe it makes it easier to forget.
but maybe it means something, like a math puzzle or something like that.
but maybe it might be fun to try some ice breakers.
but maybe it might help you.
but maybe it needed a great cause to bring them together
but maybe it should be just the two meters from which I release it.
but maybe it should be on your anaesthesiologist's mind.
but maybe it should.
but maybe it took me coming up here to realize
but maybe it was just meant to happen.
but maybe it was too heavy.
but maybe it wasn't you.
but maybe it wasn't.
but maybe it will give his friend some peace.
but maybe it will in the future. I'm really gonna work really hard this week,
but maybe it won't work.
but maybe it would be better to wait.
but maybe it would be safer...
but maybe it would have stopped me.
but maybe it would help overall morale
but maybe it would've been better if my father were have been there.
but maybe it'll be a little bit better
but maybe it'll be pretty straightforward.
but maybe it'll change the system.
but maybe it'll come back with more practice.
but maybe it's a copycat.
but maybe it's a good thing that they changed.
but maybe it's a way to keep a little dignity
but maybe it's asking too much to ban smoking in public place altogether.
but maybe it's because we're just not looking at it right.
but maybe it's been there since I first knew you.
but maybe it's better for him to stay out of the firing line for now.
but maybe it's better if we come clean now, on our own terms.
but maybe it's catching in some sense, either by evil spirits which
but maybe it's enough for them to know that their initials would grace
but maybe it's exactly what you need.
but maybe it's for the best.
but maybe it's for the best. You're here with your family.
but maybe it's for the same reasons now.
but maybe it's just a restaurant.
but maybe it's just my paper.
but maybe it's just suggestion
but maybe it's me.
but maybe it's my fault.
but maybe it's not a drug. - No, it has to be a drug.
but maybe it's not exciting enough.
but maybe it's not just the cooking or the cleaning...
but maybe it's not my fault.
but maybe it's not quite as much fun as getting to pleasure all them mandingos,
but maybe it's not so far - fetched, either.
but maybe it's not what we think it is, you know?
but maybe it's not what you're talking about.
but maybe it's not your mistake at all.
but maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.
but maybe it's still a nice piece of his story.
but maybe it's the daughter he's not getting credit for.
but maybe it's time I tried to feel better.
but maybe it's time for you to come clean.
but maybe it's time to forgive and forget. I don't know if I could do it.
but maybe it's time.
but maybe it's too hard.
but maybe it's too much.
but maybe it's what I deserve.
but maybe it's when I watch him walk out that door at night.
but maybe it's worth it, as long as we keep our relationship secret.
but maybe it's worth it.
but maybe it's you!
but maybe it...
but maybe just a nibble.
but maybe just concentrate on having your own fun Halloween.
but maybe just find out her name or - Something about her.
but maybe just half a drink more. - Put some records on while I pour.
but maybe l - maybe I put it away because of the fact that...
but maybe last year.
but maybe later we could - - still gay.
but maybe lunch tomorrow?
but maybe messy is what you need.
but maybe my children can.
but maybe my dad would've come with us to do this.
but maybe my experience...
but maybe my older brother didn't see this place.
but maybe my older brother didn't see this place.
but maybe next time you could try it without the sledgehammer.
but maybe next time you could try it.
but maybe next time you could try juggling instead.
but maybe next time, instead of distracting me,
but maybe next week.
but maybe next year, if I do good here,
but maybe next year.
but maybe no one wanted to know for sure.
but maybe not 30 years ago.
but maybe not as good as he thought.
but maybe not big enough.
but maybe not both on the same day.
but maybe not for a week.
but maybe not for a while, so we can afford to wait.
but maybe not for her.
but maybe not for long.
but maybe not for much longer.
but maybe not for the same reason.
but maybe not so much for me as for Irene,
but maybe not so much in hybrids.
but maybe not the case.
but maybe not the drums.
but maybe not the way that you wanted, and I am sorry.
but maybe not with this.
but maybe now I do.
but maybe now is not a good time for you.
but maybe now is not a good time.
but maybe now more so - her hair.
but maybe now she'll get of her high horse and let me take her out.
but maybe now she'll get off her high horse and let me take her out.
but maybe now that some time has passed, the two of you should talk.
but maybe now that some time has passed,
but maybe now we can get some answers?
but maybe now we can...
but maybe now you can forgive me
but maybe now you can heal.
but maybe now's not the time.
but maybe now, after seeing what I did,
but maybe old faithful is not so much loyal friend as a sinister watchman.
but maybe once I can... Uh, no. Don't do that.
but maybe once I can...
but maybe once, we'll make some kind of an arrangement.
but maybe one day, she'll put the bitterness behind her,
but maybe one day. Aye, we've all got our dreams.
but maybe one of these days, you'll be able to admit that not everything is my fault.
but maybe one thing in our favour is that we know benfica have to win, so they will have to come out and attack us.
but maybe others can convince them.
but maybe others can provide a "solution" that can push snooping software on to handsets.
but maybe our friends on the other side know.
but maybe over dinner. I'm not sure what time I'll be home at.
but maybe part of the problem is also that we are taking a purely rational approach to the formulation of strategy.
but maybe people will laugh at it
but maybe put you wrong.
but maybe putting these pieces together.
but maybe saint Malachy can help.
but maybe sarcasm is generally one of the traits he loves about you (just not directed at him all the time).
but maybe seeing her again will give you the closure
but maybe seeing her again.
but maybe she and your son, will, wanna...
but maybe she can really turn a phrase. Let's eat.
but maybe she can tell us something that'll put us onto the right person.
but maybe she can tell us.
but maybe she changed it.
but maybe she did. We don't know.
but maybe she did.
but maybe she didn't hear me.
but maybe she didn't want to skip class.
but maybe she doesn't know where to look.
but maybe she has a pattern.
but maybe she is delayed on far more pleasant business?
but maybe she just wanted to disappear for a while.
but maybe she met someone.
but maybe she punched in an address before she left the club.
but maybe she should have missed the field trip.
but maybe she should just let it go.
but maybe she wanted to avoid the crowd.
but maybe she was hitting the bar, because look
but maybe she'd be proud that her grandson is railing a hot demon.
but maybe she'd change her mind if the invitation came from you.
but maybe she'll be able to forgive.
but maybe she'll change, since I love her.
but maybe she'll hear you.
but maybe she'll let me stay with you.
but maybe she'll still come around. We can't wait to find out.
but maybe she's just a scared woman trying to stay a step ahead of her abuser.
but maybe she's just confused in this new environment.
but maybe she's no better.
but maybe some more boys than girls, because....
but maybe some mysteries are better left unsolved.
but maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class.
but maybe some things you just don't come back from.
but maybe somebody else can.
but maybe somebody should. I got a game to coach.
but maybe somebody should. I got a game to coach.
but maybe someday my son will.
but maybe someday my son will.
but maybe someday when my ship comes in
but maybe someday when we move to the suburbs...
but maybe someday you 'll...
but maybe someday. If you don't mind,
but maybe someday.
but maybe someone eIse was.
but maybe someone else can.
but maybe someone else cares.
but maybe someone should try injecting him with a big old dose of promicin.
but maybe something better.
but maybe something good is gonna come of the study.
but maybe something more is going on.
but maybe sometimes you just forget how to fly.
but maybe take a clothes - peg for your nose.
but maybe tell me next time
but maybe that bad stuff will lead to something good.
but maybe that bad stuff will lead to something good.
but maybe that can change now that you've had some time apart.
but maybe that doesn't come across over the phone.
but maybe that don't matter.
but maybe that explains the hospital vision you had.
but maybe that guilt just makes it dirtier and better...
