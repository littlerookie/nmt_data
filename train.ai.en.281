Mm - hmm. - we settled the deal with the cars.
Mm - hmm. - we're famous!
Mm - hmm. - what about demand?
Mm - hmm. - what? No. That's absurd. That is absurd.
Mm - hmm. - when I'm drunk
Mm - hmm. - where was it?
Mm - hmm. - where you wanna go?
Mm - hmm. - who's gonna go first?
Mm - hmm. - you have given me so much beautiful food.
Mm - hmm. - you know what? Whatever.
Mm - hmm. - you learn to recognize the type.
Mm - hmm. - you need any help here?
Mm - hmm. - you used me to get a plea deal.
Mm - hmm. - you with me so far?
Mm - hmm. -... And begin to cry...
Mm - hmm. 42,000 a year, plus benefits.
Mm - hmm. 80% is not enough.
Mm - hmm. A - all of it.
Mm - hmm. A new one.
Mm - hmm. A year after his release,
Mm - hmm. About an hour ago.
Mm - hmm. About an hour ago.
Mm - hmm. About what exactly?
Mm - hmm. Absolutely, I will.
Mm - hmm. Again, not my words.
Mm - hmm. All is forgiven.
Mm - hmm. All right, Cagney and Lacey, what do you got?
Mm - hmm. All right, he lied,
Mm - hmm. All right, talk to the neighbors.
Mm - hmm. All right, well, talk to her.
Mm - hmm. All right. Good night.
Mm - hmm. All right. I'll shut up.
Mm - hmm. All right. Well, don't - don't say anything.
Mm - hmm. Almost to the day.
Mm - hmm. Among other things.
Mm - hmm. An honorary position.
Mm - hmm. And God's keeping score. Is that it?
Mm - hmm. And I see you're also a big fan of rainbows.
Mm - hmm. And I think that is very important.
Mm - hmm. And I thought,
Mm - hmm. And I told you.
Mm - hmm. And I would replace it with a titanium mesh cage
Mm - hmm. And I'll tell you something else.
Mm - hmm. And I'll tell you something else.
Mm - hmm. And I'm detecting just a touch of cilantro and
Mm - hmm. And a son.
Mm - hmm. And according to Interpol, all of them got criminal records back in the motherland -
Mm - hmm. And chances are...
Mm - hmm. And completed my case rotation.
Mm - hmm. And do you know why she did that?
Mm - hmm. And how are you still alive?
Mm - hmm. And how would you do that? Traction halo?
Mm - hmm. And if I know my son,
Mm - hmm. And if he doesn't?
Mm - hmm. And it felt good.
Mm - hmm. And it's actually getting worse.
Mm - hmm. And it's looking out, and she's sitting -
Mm - hmm. And moved when I was still young.
Mm - hmm. And not just here.
Mm - hmm. And not nag me about leaving if you get tired?
Mm - hmm. And not only did she take it for one hour,
Mm - hmm. And other parts.
Mm - hmm. And sharing secrets and drinking cocoa.
Mm - hmm. And she's good.
Mm - hmm. And somehow everything
Mm - hmm. And that is why the lid is being kept on on gang violence
Mm - hmm. And the girl in it too.
Mm - hmm. And the head of his local,
Mm - hmm. And the lilies?
Mm - hmm. And then maybe -
Mm - hmm. And then returns them to the dealer?
Mm - hmm. And then you dumped her?
Mm - hmm. And there just weren't enough man hours -
Mm - hmm. And these are the people who entered
Mm - hmm. And this is the only lab with carbon - dating equipment?
Mm - hmm. And topless model?
Mm - hmm. And trust me, that is a considerable compliment...
Mm - hmm. And two producers, and I am seating them stage left,
Mm - hmm. And we'd appreciate your support.
Mm - hmm. And we're over.
Mm - hmm. And we're trying.
Mm - hmm. And what, you think I knew this,
Mm - hmm. And yet they haven't come by since, have they?
Mm - hmm. And you were there.
Mm - hmm. And you would never dream of jeopardizing everything
Mm - hmm. And you're blushing. - I'm not blushing.
Mm - hmm. And you're not an easy sell.
Mm - hmm. And you? Yeah, ditto.
Mm - hmm. And, tell me again what you did after I left yesterday.
Mm - hmm. And, uh, as far as we can tell, at least a couple of those in there.
Mm - hmm. Another fun fact -
Mm - hmm. Another one of your big secrets, huh?
Mm - hmm. Anyone else's gaydar going off?
Mm - hmm. Anything to pull the giant stick out of its ass.
Mm - hmm. Are you deaf and fat?
Mm - hmm. Are you sure?
Mm - hmm. As far as I can tell,
Mm - hmm. As you talk,
Mm - hmm. At what point did you secure the warrant to search Mr. Fife's vehicle?
Mm - hmm. Autopsies for the wives and tox screens for the perps.
Mm - hmm. Bags, shoes, fragrances - the works.
Mm - hmm. Bags, shoes, fragrances... The works.
Mm - hmm. Because of their new extradition laws.
Mm - hmm. Because you're feeling judged.
Mm - hmm. Been chasing it ever since.
Mm - hmm. Been drinking heavier than usual?
Mm - hmm. Before I became vice principal.
Mm - hmm. Before he shuts her up for good.
Mm - hmm. Bend your knees and follow through.
Mm - hmm. Better than okay.
Mm - hmm. Blood was drained
Mm - hmm. Blow it up.
Mm - hmm. Bob Dylan; Warren Beatty; and bill Clinton. Really?
Mm - hmm. Both from offshore accounts.
Mm - hmm. Burger and fries,
Mm - hmm. But I don't think I need grief counseling.
Mm - hmm. But I promise no smells.
Mm - hmm. But I understand you did bring some clips.
Mm - hmm. But I waived it. - what?!
Mm - hmm. But I'm not that guy anymore.
Mm - hmm. But he swerved first. Lunatic.
Mm - hmm. But look at the date that they died.
Mm - hmm. But no response. Hey, listen, okay?
Mm - hmm. But she's a 2 - quadrant speaker.
Mm - hmm. But something else came up.
Mm - hmm. But the Cyclops attacked the caravan
Mm - hmm. But the boy came around a few weeks later,
Mm - hmm. But the fact is, dr. Krank...
Mm - hmm. But we were just on - on, you know -
Mm - hmm. But what's special about this one?
Mm - hmm. But you don't see that. What's it gonna take for me...
Mm - hmm. But you know what?
Mm - hmm. But you know what? Who cares?
Mm - hmm. But you know what? Worth a shot.
Mm - hmm. Buy anything for her?
Mm - hmm. Can I have another drink?
Mm - hmm. Can I talk to her
Mm - hmm. Can you hold, please?
Mm - hmm. Can you track it?
Mm - hmm. Car was towed in a few hours ago - parking violations.
Mm - hmm. Cheers to that.
Mm - hmm. Come on. - yes, you will.
Mm - hmm. Come on. Show me your rack.
Mm - hmm. Come on. Show me your rack.
Mm - hmm. Cool. See you there.
Mm - hmm. Cross - clamp it at the base, and...
Mm - hmm. Cross - clamp it at the base, and...
Mm - hmm. Curious is good.
Mm - hmm. Dad, he called me.
Mm - hmm. Damn, what was I thinking?
Mm - hmm. Daughter was sending her little bits so I wouldn't know.
Mm - hmm. Dessert first, I always say.
Mm - hmm. Dessert first, I always say.
Mm - hmm. Did he ever mention the night she disappeared?
Mm - hmm. Did she go all the way in? All the way in.
Mm - hmm. Did you ever meet Terry?
Mm - hmm. Did you find these weapons
Mm - hmm. Didn't she tell you? - yeah.
Mm - hmm. Do it right, you know?
Mm - hmm. Do it right, you know?
Mm - hmm. Do me a favor, will you?
Mm - hmm. Do me a favor, will you?
Mm - hmm. Do me a favor...
Mm - hmm. Do you know who did it? - yes.
Mm - hmm. Do you know why kids get vaccinated at six months?
Mm - hmm. Do you think I should go?
Mm - hmm. Do you? Good.
Mm - hmm. Don't be late.
Mm - hmm. Double date tomorrow night.
Mm - hmm. Down in those deep, dark corners.
Mm - hmm. Electric or acoustic?
Mm - hmm. Electric or acoustic?
Mm - hmm. Especially if he's a narcissist.
Mm - hmm. Even put a stamp on his forehead.
Mm - hmm. Every single one frosted, shuttered.
Mm - hmm. Everything's fine.
Mm - hmm. Except none of them ever get there.
Mm - hmm. Fine. I'll eat it.
Mm - hmm. Fine. So which one of these idiots do you want to talk to first?
Mm - hmm. First time I heard it,
Mm - hmm. Flash forward to the present -
Mm - hmm. For how long?
Mm - hmm. Force the plane down in Portland.
Mm - hmm. From the North pole.
Mm - hmm. Fuck, the last time something like this happened,
Mm - hmm. Gets us out of our heads.
Mm - hmm. Given the state of my kitchen window,
Mm - hmm. Good luck with that.
Mm - hmm. Good one. - shut up!
Mm - hmm. Good two weeks or so? 2 1/2.

Mm - hmm. If you did an autopsy on me right now,
Mm - hmm. Impossible. There's no such thing.
Mm - hmm. Impossible. There's no such thing.
Mm - hmm. Inhat universe do you think
Mm - hmm. Interestingly enough, you also don't get any periods if it isn't working,
Mm - hmm. Is everything okay with you?
Mm - hmm. Is there anything that you could think of
Mm - hmm. Isn't it cute? No, I don't think so, no.
Mm - hmm. Isn't that crazy?
Mm - hmm. It ain't good for most,
