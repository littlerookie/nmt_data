carlyle thayer, a professor at australian defence force academy at the university of new south wales, says the trigger for the worsening disputes is largely economic.
carlyle thayer, of the australian defence force academy, notes that it has already deployed 31 of its 53 fast-attack submarines and three ohio class nuclear submarines to the pacific.
carlyle was joined in the investment by yunfeng, a chinese private equity fund backed by jack ma, the founder of alibaba, the internet company.
carlyle will supply four of the nine board directors of the new company, with the remaining five and the president nominated by xugong.
carlyle's asia growth partners iii fund acquired a 13% stake in march 2006 for about$ 25 million.
carlyle's attempt to sell kbro was not the only deal held up by taiwan's regulator.
carlyle's interest sparked criticism within china that the country shouldn't let strategically important industry leaders such as xugong fall into foreign hands.
carlyle's other asia fund that makes china investments focuses on real estate.
carlyle's report also touched briefly on its plans to acquire a majority stake in alpinvest, a dutch fund-of-funds manager with more than$ 43 billion in assets under management.
carlyle's third asia growth capital fund invested in 22 companies over the past three years, across 10 sectors including energy, consumer, technology, industrial and healthcare.
carlyle, a private-equity firm, owns a minority stake in sandler, for instance.
carlyle, regarded as a pioneer of private equity in asia, has to date largely hired industry executives to run its portfolio companies.

tpg capital gets mentioned a lot, but it doesn't have too many non-pe business lines.
tpg capital's leading china dealmaker is quitting as a partner of the us private equity group, becoming the latest high-profile investor to launch an asia-focused investment fund.
tpg fundholders have been able to sell for slightly higher prices.
tpg has a reputation among the large international private equity firms for venturing into risky markets such as russia well before its peers.
tpg has joined the queue of western private equity groups rushing to raise renminbi-denominated funds from chinese investors that will allow them to make local currency investments across the country.
tpg is one of a handful of firms to announce a yuan-denominated fund, which will raise funds from local investors.
tpg placed one of its team, kim jin-goon, on the board of li ning last july, so its move to renegotiate its terms shows little confidence in a turnround any time soon.
tpg recently announced plans to raise two chinese currency-denominated funds, each sized at more than$ 700 million.
