comac and boeing are to create and jointly fund an aviation energy conservation centre in beijing that will collaborate with universities on research into several areas including biofuels for aircraft.
comac declines to comment on the c919.
comac has been trying to develop the arj21, a small aircraft that would compete against brazil's embraer and canada's bombardier.
comac has targeted a one-third share of the domestic market, which is currently split roughly evenly between airbus and boeing.
comac hopes with the c919 to break into one of the world's most lucrative aircraft segments by offering a technologically more advanced product in the mid-sized range than boeing with its 737 or airbus with the a320.
comac is "within months" of the master schedule it has put out, says ge aviation, which is providing the core processing system, cockpit display systems, onboard maintenance systems and flight recorders for the twin-engined aircraft.
comac is a brand new entrant in the market and has the potential to break the boeing/ airbus duopoly.
comac is hoping to market the aircraft overseas after it enters into service in china in 2016.
comac is mainly drawing on components made by foreign companies with joint ventures in china, as the government has mandated.
comac of china and irkut of russia are also developing similar aircraft in the 100-to 200-seat class.
comac said in a separate statement that it had started assembling the first arj21 for delivery to customers and that it was now in the process of installing aviation systems on the aircraft.
comac says it has already received 215 orders for the c919, mainly from state-owned airlines and leasing companies.
comac was established in may 2008 with key businesses drawn from state-owned conglomerate aviation corporation of china (avic).
