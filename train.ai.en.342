Mrs merkel and the finance minister, wolfgang sch uble, insist that the deficit must be cut first.
Mrs merkel can do summitry with world and european union (eu) leaders. But, the court said, the bundestag is the only directly elected institution in germany's parliamentary democracy, so the executive branch must genuinely include it in decision-making.
Mrs merkel chipped in: "it was a meeting among friends."
