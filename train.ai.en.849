not you.
OK...
Owen, what if I get her to keep playing?
then will you tell me what happened?
that is my best deal, ok.
you have to tell me what happened here.
this is where I first met her.
wait up!
Hey! Wait up!
but they wouldn't.
I'll be right back. Wait there.
Tricia came back with a piece of rope.
there. Now you can cross.
careful! Owen
we went back to her house and played till dark.
the next day I came back to see her again.
only she wasn't there...
but they were.
Trish?
Tricia!
Tricia didn't come.
I thought maybe she was already on the other side.
and I really wanted to play.
so that's why you're still here?
because you blame her for what happened?
no. I just told you,
she wasn't even here.
I wanted to see her, so I waited.
that's all.
and you've been waiting here ever since?
I knew she'd come back...
I just didn't know she'd be in trouble.
what kind of trouble?
it's a grown-up secret.
she wouldn't want anyone else to know.
I gave her the clues.
well, whatever it is that you gave her, it's not enough.
Yes, it is.
she just missed a few.
tell Tricia to keep playing.
I'm not suggesting that we look for more clues,
but if you could at least look at what we have...
no.
Tricia, I understand.
no, I don't think you do, Melinda.
this is my wedding day.
look what I found a few minutes ago
in what would have been my wedding bed.
it's a rope. the same one that you helped Owen cross the creek with.
rope, that's an "r," right?
OK, and we've got an A-I-L.
what is that, rail?
or liar.
that would describe the ghost for ever letting me think this would be over.
he said that you have all the clues that you need,
you just haven't figured them out yet.
what does that mean? - That we're almost there.
let's just finish this, ok?
once and for all.
Yeah, I saw those in there before.
who do they belong to?
it said "Bob" in the mirror. I...
wait...
Bob could mean...
short for Robert.
Rgl.
Natalie said that Owen led her here.
maybe there's something we missed.
not unless it's Hunter's boxers.
or this.
a gift for the groom from your old friend Chris.
what is this?
it's Hunter and Christopher from 12 years ago.
Trish, can I...?
robert Langowski.
Oh, wait.
Bob?
the liar...
it's Hunter.
what's keeping her?
there must be a dozen checks made out to Christopher for way more than we agreed on.
gosh, what does all of this mean?
whatever it is, I think Owen was protecting you.
from Hunter?
from Robert Langowski.
the restaurant in Dallas, Axiom Steakhouse?
it doesn't even exist.
christopher was blackmailing him.
threatening to out him...
the way he hid the present, the lies...
Yeah, I think there's more.
I just got off the phone with one of my police friends.
no one under the name Hunter Clayton or Robert Langowski ever went to the harvard business school.
I'm sorry, Tricia.
ireland, of course. Tricia's always wanted to go there,
so for our honeymoon...
robert Langowski!
I found it, the picture of you and Christopher.
don't touch me!
everything... none of it was real.
Tricia, darling, what's wrong?
Owen?
you did it.
Tricia knows the truth. The game is over.
you saved her from marrying Hunter.
isn't that... isn't that what you wanted?
Owen?
maybe he crossed over.
I don't think so. Did everybody leave?
people cleared out of there like the place was on fire.
Trish and her mom are packing tonight to drive down to the city.
maybe we can check in on them this weekend, go down.
so, help me out here. Yeah.
are your ghosts all-knowing now?
I mean, how did Owen know the truth?
well, Hunt was at the lodge for a few days,
you know, setting things up before the wedding.
Owen probably overheard something.
and they're not my ghosts.
sorry.
did detective Neely say what was going to happen to Hunter or Bob or whoever the heck he is?
well, there's no law lying about your background.
but finance is all about trust,
so his career is over.
marriage is about trust, too.
all right, one more trip, we should be done.
Mm-hmm. you want me to go with you?
uh, No.
um, why don't you stay here,
you know, get everything done.
and then that'll give us time to come home early, right?
Oh, right. Yeah, ok. So I'll see you there.
all right.
Owen?
Owen?
where have you been? what's wrong?
I tried to fix everything for her.
and you did. she's safe now.
hunter's gone.
he's still at the lodge.
he is?
cause...I mean, I'm sure he's gonna leave soon.
there's no reason for him to stay there now.
same goes for you.
I think you're wrong.
he's really mad.
and he's acting weird.
acting weird how?
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
especially not you.
you've reached Jim.
if this is an emergency, chances are,
I'm already on my...
forget it.
detective Neely.
Hey, detective Neely, yeah, it's Melinda.
Hey, Melinda. What's up?
um, listen, Hunter is still at the lodge.
and Jim, he's up there...
is everything ok?
he's not answering his cell. I'm kind of freaking out.
I can't really explain it.
can you just meet me there?
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Thanks.
Hello?
is somebody here?
is somebody here?
what are you doing?
I'm waiting.
well, she's not coming back.
you know, let me ask you something, Jim.
you think that ghost waited his whole life to be with someone like her?
you need to leave.
his whole life?
that's right, I forgot, he's a ghost.
his whole life. He's dead.
look, come on. Listen to me...
come to think of it...
so am I.
right.
you know, I grew up by a lake just like this one, Jim.
when I was a kid, I used to sit on the beach
and I had to watch the summer families just come and go.
I remember I wanted to...go with 'em.
I worked really hard in my life.
but know what?
it's never been enough.
hunter...
so I told a lie.
just a small, little, itty-bitty one.
just so I could open the door, you know?
and it just got bigger and bigger.
well, now's the time to shut it down.
OK?
give me the gun, Hunter.
what, this?
dispatch 10 to 180, confirm your location, over.
280 to dispatch, I'm off highway 5 near Morton Creek.
intruder possible. Stand by.
Where's Jim?!
he's still inside. Stay here.
hunter, you rebuilt your life from nothing.
you've done that, you did it before.
do it again.
you know, you're right.
nothing.
cause that's what I am.
and that ghost is more real than you'll ever be.
No!
Jim!
Jim, it's Bobby.
try to open your eyes if you can.
I'm here with Melinda. Can you hear me?
Jim, wake up.
Jim, please wake up.
Mel.
I'm right here.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
I tried to get here as fast as I could.
don't be sorry.
there's no pain.
you don't have to be brave.
I'm not, honey, I'm in shock.
I don't feel any pain.
Oh, god!
guys, it doesn't mean I didn't feel that.
dude, wait.
sorry about our date.
shh, it's ok.
rain check... - Yes, Yes.
we gotta go.
I'll hold you to that.
go.
I didn't know what you wanted,
so I got you hot chocolate, tea and coffee.
you're sweet.
Hey, I'll put it down here.
so any news?
he was supposed to be out of surgery 40 minutes ago. - Ms. Gordon? - yes?
Jim's surgery was successful,
and he's in stable condition.
Oh, thank god.
if you like, I can walk you down to the recovery area.
we'll wait here.
the damage was much less than we first thought.
the bullet went straight through his arm
and just barely grazed his ribs.
so he's going to be ok?
we'll be keeping an eye on him tonight.
there's always the risk of infection,
and especially with gunshot wounds
we need to keep an eye out for embolisms.
we'll have our best cardiologist watching him through the night.
thank you.
a nurse will call you in soon.
how is he?
he's resting.
I feel horrible, for so many reasons.
it's ok, it's not your fault.
he'd be happy that you're here.
Thanks.
Owen's here too.
he is?
you can talk to him if you'd like. I...
think he wants you to.
Owen...
Owen, I wish I could still see you,
like I used to.
but somehow I've gotten blind as I've gotten older.
I brought a stranger into our lives.
how could I not see who he was?
you see enough.
he says you see enough.
but I was completely... - Mommy, mommy!
yeah?
let him talk.
tell her to look hard.
ask what she sees.
he wants you to look hard...
see what you see.
nothing.
sorry, I just...
I only see you.
what?
you tell her.
he says you still see it.
what? what do I see?
everything.
everything...
that matters.
come here.
thank you, Owen.
no.
thank you.
you were my friend.
was that him?
Yeah.
what's that light?
you see it because you did a really good job.
I bet your grandma's there.
she's been waiting.
I see her.
Bye, Nat.
Bye, Trish.
Bye, Owen.
he's gone.
I love you so much, sweet girl.
has he woken up yet?
just the once, after anesthesia.
do you mind if I stay till he wakes again?
thank you.
you're more beautiful every time I see you.
you're awake.
I love you.
Mel, there's a thing that happened, um...
uh, that's called an embolism.
it's a technical term, and you don't need to know about it.
let me go get you a doctor.
no, please, just look at me, right here.
please, look at me right now.
look, look at me right here.
I want you to remember me this way, please.
code blue.
code blue,
room 335.
code blue.
room 335.
I will always love you, Melinda.
No!
always.
not you!
please, not you!
please, not you!
please, not you!
no.
no. Not you.
Oh, please, not you.
no, I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.
you can't stay.
you know that. you have to cross over.
Jim, no!
No!
Jim, it's you...you're back.
do I know you?
I know that you did this to stay with me.
I can't be mad at that.
I would have missed you...
but at least I would have known where you are.
can you hear me inside there, Jim?
please...
give me a sign if you can hear me.
Hey.
Hey.
what the heck happened to me?
it's a long story.
what do you remember?
I remember you.
you do?
Yeah.
how could I not?
you're here every time I wake up.
And?
what more is there?
I mean, I barely know you,
but you're here more than anybody else I know.
or knew.
he only came to Grandview a few months ago for work.
so he has no friends here to speak of,
and his family's far away, Michigan, I think.
so who does everybody think Melinda is?
he's an architect, so Melinda's been telling people she hired him to remodel her garage.
and they bought that?
Hey, as long as the guy doesn't have any memory,
who's to say it's not true, right?
you should get a few more days rest.
Melinda thinks that Jim's soul just magically went into this guy?
she says that when Sam died,
and Jim's spirit took its place somehow.
Melinda says she's seen it before.
it's called a step-in.
when is she planning on telling him all of this?
as soon as he remembers who she is to him.
she's afraid if she tells him now,
he'll think she's insane.
this has got to be one of the stages of grief,
eh, just Melinda-style, right?
you wanna look through your stuff again?
the doctor says that...
right. the amnesia therapy, huh?
here.
Oh. how sick do you have to be not even remember your own face, huh?
you're not sick.
there's no brain damage.
you're just temporarily...
wait a minute. right here it says
I have an appointment with Jordan, whoever that is, tomorrow.
you want me to keep the appointment for you, - find out? - sure.
why are you so nice to me?
I mean, I'm just a guy you hired to do a job, right?
but you've been here every day since I woke up.
let's just say I knew someone like you
who was there for me once.
Hey.
what are you guys doing here?
what, your friends can't come and take you out for a nice meal?
Oh, that's...that's nice,
but I'm just gonna turn in.
sure.
OK.
how long are we gonna pretend this is ok?
Jordan?
Yeah.
who are you?
Hi.
I'm Melinda. I'm a friend of Sam's.
where is he? Is he ok?
Yeah. He's fine.
thank god.
so worried when he didn't come home last night.
are you...are you Sam's girlfriend?
no.
God, no.
I'm his sister.
how do you know Sam anyway?
through his work.
look, the reason that I'm here is there was an accident.
he wasn't hurt too badly, but he's still in the hospital.
what happened?
we should go see him,
talk to the doctors, let them explain.
OK.
she's staying in his apartment until she can get one of her own and a job.
he was supposed to meet her
to help apply for a cellphone.
I'm so glad you're all right! - I'm fine.
am I a terrible person?
Why?
I'm relieved that he didn't recognize her,
because if he did, he might not be Jim.
might not be?
look, I see the same guy that you see,
different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.
but the day of the accident,
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body,
and ever since then, he hasn't appeared to me.
he's gone.
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes, and Jim...
is in there somewhere.
do you need anything before I go? - I'm all right.
he just has to be.
he doesn't remember me.
not my name, not my face.
it's one stupid thing, he,
he remembers the smell of my shampoo.
he remembers your shampoo?
it's the same almond-scented stuff I've always used.
he used to tease me about it relentlessly.
Really?
how long do you think it'll take before he remembers the rest?
Never! That's when.
what?
nothing, sure it's nothing at all.
Hey, can you get me that box,
the one that says "sports"?
you ok?
Yeah， sure.
how's the guy doing,
the one in the hospital?
he died in an accident.
then he...
was revived when Jim's spirit stepped into his body.
his name was Sam.
is...is Sam.
is he remembering stuff yet?
I don't know. I...
he seems to remember me a little,
but then there's other times...
what?
well, all of a sudden,
he likes different foods than Jim used to, and he can remember
the smell of his sister's shampoo.
Eli says that it's like a physical thing,
like some sort of muscle memory,
but if it is Jim,
how does he recognize Sam...
what?
you don't have to stop on my account.
you know, actually you guys have done so much,
I think I'm good here, so...
I didn't know you had practiced today.
I thought your shooting clinic was on mondays.
it's Jim's.
do you think it's ok if I take it instead of donating it?
Yeah.
of course, honey.
I know you miss him, Ned.
Melinda told me that you would play pickup games with Jim practically every weekend.
I know we're lucky to have each other, mom...
but sometimes...
Jim was like a dad to you.
I know.
I want you to know
that I was happy that you felt that way about him.
it's ok to be sad, Ned.
we all are.
I know.
we just all deal with it in different ways.
Yeah.
who are you?
what do you want?
you were at the hospital.
you've been following me.
just tell me what you want, or I can't help you.
the two of you, you're both thieves.
but you won't get to keep what you've stolen.
what have I stolen?
you know perfectly well.
where did Sam go?
he was checked out last night.
by who?
I don't know, maybe if you ask...
yes?
Hi. my name is Melinda Gordon. I'm a friend of Sam's.
a client, actually, and I went to the hospital,
and they told me that he was on his way home. That's right.
I'm Nancy Lucas, Sam's mother,
and this is my husband Gerald.
mom and dad.
w-well, that...that's great
that they... that they finally found you.
it was so kind of you to look after Sam while he was in the hospital,
but you don't have to be concerned about him now.
his family's here, and we're gonna be taking him home.
isn't this his home?
well, uh, Sam doesn't even know his own mother,
but luckily his mother knows him.
he'll be coming home with us until he can find himself again.
with you?
you're gonna have to find somebody else
to do your blueprints, I'm afraid.
he won't be much help to you 800 miles away.
now, um, if you'll excuse us.
the ghost seemed pretty bent out of shape.
he kept calling us thieves and saying
that we would never get to keep what we've stolen.
Hey, was the ghost a guy in his late thirties,
kind of a high forehead?
sounds like him. Why?
alan Walters...
the driver who caused the accident,
died on the scene.
so I'm not crazy. That's good news.
good news? The guy kind of died.
no, it's not good news that he's dead,
but that he was a witness.
to the accident? -to what happened afterwards.
if he was there, he saw what Jim did.
that's why he's calling us thieves, 'cause he saw Jim go into Sam's body.
so good news that you are thieves.
no. Sam went into the light, that I'm sure of,
but this Alan guy, he must not have noticed.
why didn't you notice him?
I was a little distracted.
the important thing is that the reason he's haunting me
is because he knows that Jim did.
Melinda, I've been in some very strange bookstores,
which is why my clothes stink of patchouli,
and read some very interesting things on this whole step-in phenomenon.
first of all, it tends to be permanent.
and second?
supposedly it's like reincarnation.
no. reincarnation happens at birth.
I've already dealt with that.
of course you have,
but the book says that in both cases,
memories of past lives are usually lost.
you gotta wonder how much of the Jim you know
is in the Sam that you don't.
if you take him home, the first thing
he's gonna do is remember how much he hates you.
the doctors said he should be in familiar surroundings
to help him remember who he is.
you mean who you want him to be.
you're just upset because he can't
remember he promised to let you freeload of him.
at least he offered to take me in,
unlike you two, who just kicked me out.
we did not kick you out.
we told you that if you dropped out of college,
you'd have to pay rent.
if you wanted to continue living at home.
Oh, I'm not sure "wanted" is a good word.
it's not like I had a whole lot of options.
you make your own options.
what are you, a fortune cookie?
I remember something.
Oh, Sam, that's wonderful.
you see? Having us around is helping already.
what is it, dear?
coffee.
anybody make any?
we were just, uh, talking about fixing up your old room.
how old am I?
look at you guys.
this is like a dream come true for you...
a chance to control him all over again.
that's enough, Jordan.
look, maybe I-I'll take a shower first and then...
sure, and then we'll have some coffee,
and we'll talk about your future.
right, something to look forward to.
putting together a memory book?
Yeah, kind of.
is it for you or for him?
both, I guess.
I...I was kind of hoping that maybe Jim...
Sam would see it and it would jog something.
I know you think I'm out of my mind,
but I'm not.
no, I didn't suggest for one...
excuse me. I'm sorry I came,
uh, straight to your store, but the hospital gave me your address.
no, it's fine, really.
good. because I'm, uh...
wait a minute.
I know you.
you do? - Really?
no. You came to the hospital, didn't you?
uh, yes, but I don't think we actually met.
I'm...I'm Delia.
I'm Sam.
well, so they tell me.
look, I don't know much about brain functions,
but I know I'm not gonna get my memory back
unless I relax,
and right now, my family is imploding,
and you're the only person I know
who's not desperate for me to remember them,
so are you busy right now?
um, not...not really.
I went to the deli and got a couple sandwiches.
you wanna go somewhere?
I got it covered.
Thanks.
why stop at one?
I mean, we could... we could have a whole house full of kids.
it would be fun raising them, I think.
it'd be even more fun making them.
Don't...don't press your luck.
well, it's like on the one hand,
sure, I'd like to remember who the hell I am,
but on the other, I don't remember what it's like to remember,
so I don't feel like I'm missing much.
I lost you, didn't I?
no.
no, sorry. I...I was just...
thinking about something.
a memory, huh? Showoff.
does anything look familiar to you?
I'm afraid not.
but honestly, after the way my family was going at it,
amnesia is my new best friend.
what do you mean?
I mean that from the looks of it, my old life,
maybe it's good riddance, you know?
maybe it's better I let it go and start over again.
Yeah, or maybe your old life wasn't as bad as it seems.
you know something about it I don't?
look, the truth is
I actually feel at peace right now.
I mean, I know I had problems in my old life,
but suddenly, woof, they're all gone.
is it wrong not to want them back?
I...I think you should do whatever feels right.
trust your instincts.
Yeah.
I still have no idea why you're so nice to me.
I know. I must have done a spectacular job on that garage.
wait a minute. Could you do that again?
could you just laugh, 'cause...
that sounded familiar.
what do you say I conk you on the head,
and then you can forget your worries, too?
cause then we could just sit here and enjoy this glorious, oblivious afternoon together.
Yeah.
that sounds good.
really good.
how do you like seeing a stranger in the mirror?
I know who you are, Alan.
I know about your wife and your son.
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you.
I can help you， it's what I do.
the same way you helped when your husband stole Sam's body?
Jim didn't steal anything.
he stole that family's chance to mourn their son.
thanks to your Jim, they will never believe that Sam is dead.
right after the accident, I saw the light, too.
I watched Sam go into it,
almost followed him.
why didn't you?
cause that accident that we had, it was my fault.
I didn't deserve to go into the light, not yet.
when I saw your husband take over Sam's body,
I knew what my purpose was.
I saw how I had to make things right. - how?
by making sure they know the truth.
who, his family?
all of them.
they need to know what you did
so they all can move on.
what if I think they're better off not knowing?
then you are lying to yourself, too!
and I will make sure they know the truth
if I have to stay here the rest of your miserable life.
Hey. sorry. I was about to knock.
uh, no. no, i...it's... I'm sorry. It's just I'm...
little jumpy. It's ok. What happened?
a tree branch broke my bedroom window.
Hey, l-let me.
all right.
recycling, right? Ok.
thank you.
I think I remember how to replace a pane of glass.
that's Ok， you don't have to do that.
well, I gotta do something.
I mean, everybody tells me to get back to my old routine.
I went back to work this morning.
you can imagine how much I remember about architecture
and then subtract a lot.
sorry.
maybe my parents were right.
maybe I should go back with them.
at least I'd have a roof over my head.
wh-what about your apartment?
Ah， the lease is up,
and they want a 6-month renewal.
no income, no job...
there's not a whole lot keeping me here.
you know, if, um...
if you remember how to fix glass...
what about carpentry?
measure twice, cut one，sure.
it's not much, but maybe
you could help me finish my garage.
um, well, that's very generous,
but I don't think it'll cover my rent.
there's plumbing and a fridge,
and you could live there while you do the work.
you know, just until you...
figure out your next move.
maybe I found something to keep me here.
sorry I'm late. I just had to go over some things with Sam.
he's decided to stay in town.
Oh, really? wh-what's he gonna do?
um, you know, this, that,
just until he gets back on his feet.
so that's great, but...
why are you trying to keep our son here?
um, because I wanna help, and because he's...
he's not your responsibility， we're his parents.
you have no right to tell him what to do.
I didn't. I just made him an offer.
to be your live-in handyman?
that's...you know what? I understand how hard this is.
don't stand there and tell us you understand
when you can't possibly.
he needs to be in familiar surroundings
with people who'll love him and embrace him
no matter how much of his memory he recovers.
I want the same thing for him that you do.
I just think he should be able to decide how to find it.
thank you for your professional opinion.
he's coming home with us.
all right, Sam.
let's see what you got.
Great， that's what I remember.
Grandview...paramedic Jim Clancy was shot and killed last night.
clancy is survived by his wife...
Melinda Gordon.
am I too early?
no, not at all.
let me just go open up the garage for you.
would you mind if I had a little coffee first?
Sure，uh, milk, no sugar?
black's fine.
Thanks.
Melinda, look, um...
everybody's walking on eggshells around me,
and I can't blame them, but...
I really need some honesty right now.
are you asking me a question?
you hired me to do the remodel of your garage, but...
I'm starting to get the weird feeling
that there's a lot more to it.
what is it?
it's just, uh...
that's your husband, right?
you know, you'd think I'd recognize his face.
why would you say that?
well, he must have been around when I started the job.
before he died, I mean.
you know about that?
Yeah. I read about it in the paper.
I'm monopolizing your time.
I'm yammering on and on.
you just lost a husband.
why didn't you tell me?
you had enough on your plate.
you don't?
look, there's something I have to tell you,
and it's not gonna be easy for me or for you, I'm sure.
do you have an open mind?
more like an empty one, but...
do you believe in the afterlife?
heaven or ghosts?
both.
what about stuff like reincarnation?
like respect cows
because they might be your ancestors?
sort of.
my husband just died,
and you just had a brush with death also.
Heh. wait, you're not gonna tell me you think
I'm your husband reincarnated,
because...
you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
no.
no, of course not. I...I just, um...
I just thought maybe you'd be able to understand what he went through
since you just kind of died yourself,
and I just need to know he's ok wherever he is.
sorry
whatever.
Ah, your high school yearbook.
Oh, my god. you were such a geek.
you know, Jordan,
you've been playing the remember when game for about an hour now,
and I'm kind of getting the sneaking suspicion
that you're trying to get me to remember
when I said that I'd lend you some money.
Wow.
no, really, I...
Oh, there you are.
where have you been?
I started work again.
Oh. for that woman?
whose name is Melinda, yes.
Oh, listen, sweetheart,
we wanted to talk to you about this.
look, I just wanna do what feels right now.
all of your doctors agree you need to come home.
what I need is for you to stop pressuring me.
I know you mean well...
you're coming home with us now.
we've already bought your ticket.
it's nonrefundable.
good, because I'm not going.
finally, the Sam I know.
but you should go.
excuse me?
look, I need to decide my own future.
I...I know that, and I'm ready for it,
whether I get my past back or not,
but, Jordan, you're barely 20 years old,
and you're acting a lot less.
you're not ready to take care of yourself.
do you have any idea how much you sound just like them?
you know, you told me how much I hated these people.
sorry. no offense.
but...but to me, they seem like they genuinely care about us.
if I can forget why I was so angry at them.
why can't you?
Hello! you lost your memory.
well, maybe you should, too.
Jordan.
Jordan.
no. Sam, wait.
don't you run away, too, please.
what's left of my mind is made up.
you're here early.
Hey, whatever's wrong,
you don't have to hide it from me.
trust me,
it's not anything you wanna hear about.
Melinda, you gotta stop thinking like that.
I'm your friend,
and I love you.
I just...
I couldn't lie anymore...
so I started to tell Sam the truth.
Jim...
he never doubted anything I told him.
but Sam...
you should have seen the look on his face.
it's like I told him I was abducted by aliens.
I'm so sorry.
I know this is probably the worst pain you have ever felt.
what do I do?
you get angry, that's what.
you gotta curse the universe and break some stuff.
breaking stuff, that sounds great.
it's the next stage after denial.
denial?
the stages of grief.
you're just going through what we all went through,
what I went through with Charlie.
some people call it denial.
some call it magical thinking.
whatever it is, it's...it's completely normal.
normal...
but not real.
unfortunately, no.
do you remember Jim's funeral...
when everybody started to dance
and I told you afterwards that Jim had made that happen
and you said you believed it?
you said that you could feel him there, too.
that was different.
that's what you always do.
you talk to ghosts or whatever it is,
and you make people's lives better.
well, how is it different this time?
it's different, because you aren't helping anyone.
you're not helping Sam,
you're not helping his family,
and you are definitely not helping yourself.
the last conscious decision my husband made
was to risk everything just to be with me.
I am not gonna turn my back on that.
that's great.
believe he is out there somewhere.
you are not listening to me, as usual.
as usual?
I know it's bizarre.
all right, it's even hard for me to believe,
but it's what happened.
Jim is not just "out there somewhere.
he's here, in this man's body.
Melinda... - No, he took a chance
out of love and out of loyalty
for the one person who meant everything to him,
even though he knows it doesn't make any sense.
that is what love is,
in case you're unsure.
so there's no middle ground?
I have to check my common sense at the door,
or we can't be friends?
what's wrong?
rough day.
me, too.
you moving in?
what's wrong?
well, look, I been thinking about this.
you've been amazingly supportive.
uh, but it's just weird.
I mean, I don't even know you,
and suddenly I'm moving into your place.
and then what's even weirder is...
I mean, how I feel when we're together.
it's ok.
Ah, is it?
Heh. the point is...
no matter how painful this whole thing has been,
I've been given a second chance,
and I realized that last night when I stood up to my parents and my sister.
OK. So, take your time.
do whatever it is that you need to do to get your memory back.
I don't know if I want to get it back.
look, I don't know if the guy I was
is the kind of guy I wanna be.
what kind of guy is that?
the kind that has an affair with a married woman.
tell him.
you deserve an explanation.
he deserves the truth.
but all I can give you right now
is that I would have never cheated on my husband, ever.
will you tell me what is going on between us?
cause I'm confused,
and whenever I'm around you, I can't think straight.
because I feel so familiar?
that's part of it.
do I feel like a friend?
at least.
that you can trust?
I think so.
then trust me.
I just don't know if can trust myself.
Sam, look...
look, thank you for helping me, ok?
thank you, but I think we're better off...
maybe I just go away, huh?
go?
where?
I guess I know when I get there.
Oh, Melinda.
is she here? where's Sam?
where did you send him?
I don't know. - oh, terrific.
the boy can't remember a damn thing,
and now he's out wandering all alone.
do you really think that's what he needs?
no. actually, I wanted him to stay.
well, what are we supposed to do now?
I have no idea.
but if he ever gives you a second chance,
I hope you don't blow it like you did the first time.
I beg your pardon?
I know what it's like to lose someone
and do not know if it's for good.
I know that impulse to do everything humanly possible just to get them back.
sometimes impulses are wrong.
are you a parent? - No,
and I'm not a doctor either,
but believe me when I say that you have to start preparing yourself for the fact that your son
may never remember who he was.
look, Ms. Gordon...
and you should be grateful for that. you know why?
because you'll actually have a son.
at some point, he's gonna need his family,
and he will call,
but all he's gonna remember is who you are now,
so wouldn't you want that to be a good thing?
what is that supposed to mean, exactly?
you've held on to your children so tight that you've lost them both.
but there's still time to maybe get them back,
but not if you keep making the same mistakes.
Hey. where are you?
at the cafe, doing homework.
Oh. I thought I'd surprise you
and stop by and take you out for something to eat, but you're not here.
where? - At the courts.
isn't your shooting clinic on Mondays?
OK, promise you won't get mad.
well, I promise I will if you don't start talkin'.
mom, there's no shooting clinic on Mondays.
what?
I used to meet Jim there on Mondays to practice,
but I didn't tell you it was just him and me,
because I was afraid if you knew,
you'd make me come and work at the store instead.
Ned, I wish you would have...
mom, please don't be mad.
I'm not mad. I'm ju...
I have to call you back.
Sam?
Hey. Delia, right?
what are you doing here?
Heh. promise not to laugh?
I have no idea.
I was driving out of town.
I was leaving...
and then suddenly I got this feeling
that I was supposed to be somewhere,
somewhere important.
so I just came here.
weird, isn't it? heh.
Yeah. you could say that.
I was hoping someone would recognize me...
they could tell me why I had to be here.
it's really you.
sorry?
I think you could be right.
I think you are supposed to be somewhere.
where?
you tried.
I will never forget that.
if you never forgive me, I will understand,
but I couldn't just sit around and do nothing
when this whole thing was ready to blow away.
what whole thing? what are you talking about?
you and Jim, your future together,
your whole everything.
are you drunk?
no, there is no time to explain, Mel.
he's outside.
who? - Jim.
I mean Sam... Jim...Sam...
whatever the hell his name is.
but I convinced him to come back
and talk to you, but you have to figure out what to do next.
where did you?
he was on the basketball court on the way out of town.
I saw him, I stopped, and I convinced him
to come back and talk to you.
why did you?
because he was waiting for Ned,
and I finally understood.
what?
that I was wrong.
OK? About pretty much everything.
and I know that we are gonna talk about this endlessly in the future,
but right now, you have to go outside
and make sure that Jim does not get back on that road and go out of town.
you keep calling him Jim.
that's who he is, isn't he?
OK, stop, go.
it's ok.
got my best friend back.
OK, quit your blubbering.
you made me blubber.
Oh, wait a sec.
Delia.
there's a stain on it.
you gotta really be presentable.
you got any lip gloss?
no, if it's Jim, I don't need lip gloss.
do you know how lucky you are?
you are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.
OK. go.
go, go, go.
OK.
you're back.
I apologize for before.
I got a little overdramatic.
it's ok. I don't...
I mean, if I'm on some search to find out
what feels right in my life, you know,
what places and what people,
you know, I should take baby steps.
I should start at square one and not square 10.
and if that does...
you know what? Whatever your reasons are,
I'm fine with it.
you don't need to explain anything.
maybe that's best for now, for both of us.
OK.
OK.
can I move this stuff into your garage?
Yeah. I'll help you.
Thanks.
Hey, you guys need some help?
sure. - Sure.
did I mention my, uh...
my parents called my sister
and apologized for a lifetime of controlling behavior?
and then Jordan just got up and went back home with them.
I had no idea.
Oh, yeah? because when I asked them why the big change of heart,
they said that they had talked to you
and that you had talked sense to them.
how'd you do that?
I have a few talents.
a few talents?
that's what you're gonna leave me with?
OK.
no explanations.
I'll be right there.
Hey, Sam, why don't you, uh...
show me what you're planning to do with the space in here?
love to, if I can remember.
I know what you're thinking.
it's a good thing you didn't listen to me.
I beg your pardon?
if there's one thing I thought being dead would make me an expert on, it was being dead,
but I was wrong.
that's your specialty, like you said.
I've been at it a while.
I wanted them to have the closure,
but you held out for more.
you gave them their family back.
are you ready?
to go into the light?
it's been following me around all day.
but there is one thing I wanted to say to you before I went in.
what?
what your husband did might just be a miracle.
I hope it is,
because after a lifetime of this,
a miracle's what you deserve.
Hey, uh, you ok?
Yeah.
no, not you! No. No. No. Oh, please, not you.
no, I'm here, and I'm not go in' anywhere.
you can't stay. You know that. You have to cross over.
Jim, no!
Jim, it's you-- y-you're back.
do I know you?
I know that you did this to stay with me.
I can't be mad at that.
but you could have gone into the light.
I would have missed you...
but at least I would have known where you are.
can you hear me inside there, Jim?
please... Give me a sign if you can hear me.
what the heck happened to me?
it's a long story.
what do you remember?
I remember you.
you do?
Yeah. How could I not?
you're here every time I wake up.
And?
what more is there?
I mean, I barely know you, but you're here more than anybody else I know.
or knew.
he only game to Grandview a few months ago for work, so he has no friends here to speak of,
and his family's far away, Michigan, I think.
so who does everybody think Melinda is?
he's an architect, so Melinda's been telling people she hired him to remodel her garage.
and they bought that?
Hey, as long as the guy doesn't have any memory, who's to say it's not true, right?
you should get a few more days rest.
Melinda thinks that Jim's soul just magically went into this guy?
she says that when sam died, his spirit went into the light,
and Jim's spirit took its place somehow.
Melinda says she's seen it before. It's called a step-in.
when is she planning on telling him all of this?
as soon as he remembers who she is to him.
she's afraid if she tells him now, he'll think she's insane.
this has got to be one of the stages of grief, eh, just Melinda-style, right?
you wanna look through your stuff again?
the doctor says that-- - right. The amnesia therapy, huh?
here.
how sick do you have to be to not even remember your own face, huh?
you're not sick. There's no brain damage. You're just temporarily
wait a minute. Right here it says I have an appointment with jordan, whoever that is, tomorrow.
you want me to keep the appointment for you, find out?
sure.
why are you so nice to me?
I mean, i'm just a guy you hired to do a job, right?
but you've been here every day since I woke up.
let's just say I knew someone like you who was there for me once.
what are you guys doing here?
what, your friends can't come and take you out for a nice meal?
Oh, that's--that's nice, but I'm just gonna turn in.
so rain check? - Sure.
how long are we gonna pretend this is ok?
Yeah. Who are you?
I'm Melinda. I'm a friend of Sam's.
where is he? Is he ok?
Yeah. He's fine. - Thank god.
so worried when he didn't come home last night.
are you--are you Sam's girlfriend?
no. God, no. I, um-- I'm his sister.
how do you know Sam anyway?
through his work.
uh, look, the reason that I'm here is there was an accident.
he wasn't hurt too badly, but he's still in the hospital.
what happened?
we should go see him, talk to the doctors, let them explain.
OK.
she's staying in his apartment until she can get one of her own and a job.
he was supposed to meet her to help apply for a cellphone.
I'm so glad you're all right!
I'm fine.
am I a terrible person?
Why?
I'm relieved that he didn't recognize her, because if he did, he might not be Jim.
might not be?
look, I see the same guy that you see, different hair, nose, eyes.
it's not Jim.
but the day of the accident, I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body,
and ever since then, he hasn't appeared to me.
he's gone.
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes, and Jim...
is in there somewhere.
do you need anything before I go? - I'm all right.
he just has to be.
he doesn't remember me.
not my name, not my face.
it's one stupid thing, he, um-- he remembers the smell of my shampoo.
he remembers your shampoo?
it's the same almond-scented stuff I've always used.
he used to tease me about it relentlessly.
Really?
how long do you think it'll take before he remembers the rest?
Never! That's when.
what? - Nothing. Sure it's nothing at all.
Hey, can you get me that box, the one that says "sports"?
you ok?
Yeah. Sure.
how's the guy do in', the one in the hospital?
he died in an accident.
then he-- was revived when Jim's spirit stepped into his body.
his name was Sam. Is--is Sam.
is he remembering stuff yet?
I don't know. I
he seems to remember me a little, but then there's other times...
what?
well, all of a sudden, he likes different foods than Jim used to,
and he can remember the smell of his sister's shampoo.
Eli says that it's like a physical thing, like some sort of muscle memory,
but if it is Jim, how does he recognize Sam
what?
you don't have to stop on my account.
you know, actually you guys have done so much, I think I'm good here, so...
I didn't know you had practice today.
I thought your shooting clinic was on mondays.
it's Jim's.
do you think it's ok if I take it instead of donating it?
Yeah. Of course, honey.
I know you miss him, Ned.
Melinda told me that you would play pickup games with Jim practically every weekend.
I know we're lucky to have each other, mom...
but sometimes...
Jim was like a dad to you. I know.
I want you to know that I was happy that you felt that way about him.
it's ok to be sad, Ned. We all are.
I know.
we just all deal with in different ways.
Yeah.
who are you?
what do you want?
you were at the hospital.
you've been following me.
just tell me what you want, or I can't help you.
the two of you, you're both thieves.
but you won't get to keep what you've stolen.
what have I stolen?
you know perfectly well.
where did Sam go?
he was checked out last night. - By who?
I don't know. Maybe if you ask
yes?
my name is Melinda Gordon. I'm a friend of Sam's.
a client, actually, and I went to the hospital, and they told me that he was on his way
home. That's right.
um, I'm Nancy Lucas, Sam's mother, and this is my husband Gerald.
mom and dad.
w-well, that--that's great that they-- that they finally found you.
it was so kind of you to look after Sam while he was in the hospital,
but you don't have to be concerned about him now.
his family's here, and we're gonna be taking him home.
isn't this his home?
well, uh, Sam doesn't even know his own mother, but luckily his mother knows him.
he'll be coming home with us until he can find himself again.
with you?
you're gonna have to find somebody else to do your blueprints, I'm afraid.
he won't be much help to you 800 miles away.
now, um, if you'll excuse us.
the ghost seemed pretty bent out of shape.
he kept calling us thieves and saying that we would never get to keep what we've stolen.
Hey, was the ghost a guy in his late thirties, kind of a high forehead?
sounds like him. Why?
alan Walters-- the driver who caused the accident, died on the scene.
so I'm not crazy. That's good news.
good news? The guy kind of died.
no, it's not good news that he's dead, but that he was a witness.
to the accident?
to what happened afterwards. If he was there, he saw what Jim did.
that's why he's calling us thieves, 'cause he saw Jim go into Sam's body.
so good news that you are thieves.
no. Sam went into the light.
that I'm sure of, but this Alan guy, he must not have noticed.
why didn't you notice him?
I was a little distracted.
the important thing is is that the reason he's haunting me is because he knows that Jim did.
Melinda, I've been in some very strange bookstores,
which is why my clothes stink of patchouli,
and read some very interesting things on this whole step-in phenomenon.
first of all, it tends to be permanent.
and second?
supposedly it's like reincarnation.
no. Reincarnation happens at birth. I've already dealt with that.
of course you have, but the book says that in both cases, memories of past lives are usually lost.
you gotta wonder how much of the Jim you know is in the Sam that you don't.
if you take him home, the first thing he's gonna do is remember how much he hates you.
the doctors said he should be in familiar surroundings to help him remember who he is.
you mean who you want him to be.
you're just upset because he can't remember he promised to let you freeload off of him.
at least he offered to take me in, unlike you two, who just kicked me out.
we did not kick you out.
we told you that if you dropped out of college, you'd have to pay rent.
if you wanted to continue living at home.
Oh, I'm not sure "wanted" is a good word.
it's not like I had a whole lot of options.
you make your own options.
what are you, a fortune cookie?
I remember something.
Oh, sam, that's wonderful.
you see? Having us around is helping already.
what is it, dear? - Coffee. Anybody make any?
we were just, uh, talking about fixing up your old room.
how old am I?
look at you guys. This is like a dream come true for you
a chance to control him all over again.
that's enough, Jordan.
look, maybe I-I'll take a shower first and then...
sure, and then we'll have some coffee, and we'll talk about your future.
right. Something to look forward to.
put in' together a memory book?
Yeah, kind of.
is it for you... Or for him?
both, I guess.
I--I was kind of hoping that maybe Jim-- Sam would see it and it would jog something.
I know you think I'm out of my mind, but I'm not.
no, I didn't suggest for one
excuse me. I'm sorry I came, uh, straight to your store, but the hospital gave me your address.
no, it's fine, really.
good. Because I'm, uh
wait a minute. I know you.
you do? - Really?
no. You came to the hospital, didn't you?
uh, yes, but I don't think we actually met.
I'm--I'm Delia. - I'm Sam.
well, so they tell me.
look, uh, I don't know much about brain functions,
but I know I'm not gonna get my memory back unless I relax, and right now, my family is imploding, and you're the only person I know who's not desperate for me to remember them, so are you busy right now?
um, not--not really.
I went to the deli and got a couple sandwiches. You wanna go somewhere?
I got it covered. - Thanks.
why stop at one? I mean, we could
we could have a whole house full of kids.
it would be fun raising them, I think.
it'd be even more fun making them.
don't--don't press your luck.
well, it's like on the one hand, sure, I'd like to remember who the he is,
but on the other, I don't remember what it's like to remember, so I don't feel like I'm miss in' much.
I lost you, didn't I?
no. No, sorry. I--I was just... Thinking about something.
a memory, huh? Showoff.
does a thing look familiar to you?
I'm afraid not.
but honestly, after the way my family was go in' at it, amnesia is my new best friend.
what do you mean?
I mean that from the looks of it, my old life, maybe it's good riddance, you know?
maybe it's better I let it go and start over again.
Yeah, or maybe your old life wasn't as bad as it seems.
you know something' about it I don't?
look, the truth is I actually feel at peace right now.
I mean, I know I had problems in my old life, but suddenly, fwoof, they're all gone.
is it wrong not to want them back?
I--I think you should...
do whatever feels right.
trust your instincts. - Yeah.
I still have no idea why you're so nice to me.
I know. I must have done a spectacular job on that garage.
Yeah.
wait a minute. Could you do that again? Could you just laugh, 'cause...
that sounded familiar.
what do you say I conk you on the head, and then you can forget your worries, too?
cause then we could just sit here and enjoy this...
glorious, oblivious afternoon together.
Yeah. That sounds good.
really good.
how do you like seeing a stranger in the mirror?
I know who you are, Alan.
I know about your wife and your son.
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you I can help you. It's what I do.
same way you helped when your husband stole sam's body?
Jim didn't steal anything.
he stole that family's chance to mourn their son.
thanks to your Jim, they will never believe that Sam is dead.
right after the accident, I saw the light, too.
I watched sam go into it, almost followed him.
why didn't you?
cause that accident that we had, it was my fault.
I didn't deserve to go into the light, not yet.
when I saw your husband take over Sam's body, I knew what my purpose was.
I saw how I had to make things right.
how?
by making sure they know the truth.
who, his family?
all of them. They need to know what you did so they all can move on.
what if I think they're better off not knowing?
then you are lying to yourself, too!
and I will make sure they know the truth if I have to stay here the rest of your miserable life.
sorry. I was about to knock.
uh, no. No, I--it'- I'm sorry. It's just I'm
little jumpy. It's ok. What happened?
a tree branch broke my bedroom window.
Hey, l-let me. All right. Recycling, right? Ok.
thank you.
I think I remember how to replace a pane of glass.
that's ok. You don't have to do that.
well, I gotta do something.
I mean, everybody tells me to get back to my old routine.
I went back to work this morning.
you can imagine how much I remember about architecture and then subtract a lot.
sorry.
maybe my parents were right. Maybe I should go back with them.
at least I'd have a roof over my head.
wh-what about your apartment?
the lease is up, and they want a 6-month renewal.
no income, no job-- there's not a whole lot keep in' me here.
you know, if, um-- if you remember how to fix glass...
what about carpentry?
measure twice, cut one. Sure.
it's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage.
um, well, that's very generous, but I don't think it'll cover my rent.
there's plumbing and a fridge, and you could live there while you do the work.
you know, just until you...
figure out your next move.
well...
maybe I found something to keep me here.
sorry I'm late. I just had to go over some things with Sam.
he's decided to stay in town.
Oh, really? Wh-what's he gonna do?
um, you know, this, that, just until he gets back on his feet.
so that's great, but
why are you trying to keep our son here?
um, because I wanna help, and because he's
he's not your responsibility. We're his parents.
you have no right to tell him what to do.
I didn't. I just made him an offer.
to be your live-in handy man?
that's--you know what? I understand how hard this is.
don't stand there and tell us you understand when you can't possibly.
he needs to be in familiar surroundings with people who'll love him and embrace him no matter how much of his memory he recovers.
I want the same thing for him that you do.
I just think he should be able to decide how to find it.
thank you for your professional opinion.
he's coming home with us.
all right, Sam. Let's see what you got.
great. That's what I remember.
Grandview... Paramedic Jim Clancy was shot and killed last night.
clancy is survived by his wife...Melinda Gordon.
am I too early?
no, not at all. Let me just go open up the garage for you.
would you mind if I had a little coffee first?
sure. Uh, milk, no sugar?
black's fine. Thanks.
Melinda, look, um...
everybody's walk in' on eggshells around me, and I can't blame them, but...
I really need some honesty right now.
are you asking me a question?
you hired me to do the remodel of your garage, but...
I'm startin' to get the weird feeling that there's a lot more to it.
what is it?
so just, uh...
that's your husband, right?
you know, you'd think I'd recognize his face.
why would you say that?
well, he must have been around when I started the job.
before he died, I mean.
you know about that? - Yeah. I read about it in the paper.
I'm monopolizing your time. I'm yammering on and on.
you just lost a husband.
why didn't you tell me?
you had enough on your plate.
you don't?
look, there's something I have to tell you, and it's not gonna be easy for me or for you, I'm sure.
do you have an open mi?
more like an empty one, but...
do you believe in the afterlife?
heaven or ghosts?
both.
what about stuff like reincarnation?
like respect cows because they might be your ancestors?
sort of.
my husband just died, and you just had a brush with death also.
wait, you're not gonna tell me you think I'm your husband reincarnated, because...
you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
no.
no, of course not. I--I just, um...
I just thought maybe you'd be able to understand what he went through since you just kind of died yourself,
and I just need to know he's ok wherever he is.
sorry.
Ah, your high school yearbook.
Oh, my god. You were such a geek.
you know, Jordan, you've been playing the remember when game for about an hour now,
and I'm kind of getting the sneaking suspicion that you're trying to get me to remember
when I said that I'd lend you some money.
major buzz kill.
no, really, I
Oh, there you are. Where have you been?
I started work again.
for that woman?
whose name is Melinda, yes.
Oh, listen, sweetheart, we wanted to talk to you about this.
look, I just wanna do what feels right now.
all of your doctors agree you need to come home.
what I need is for you to stop pressuring me.
I know you mean well-- - you're coming home with us now.
we've already bought your ticket.
it's non refundable.
good, because I'm not going.
finally, the Sam I know.
but you should go.
excuse me?
look, I need to decide my own future.
I--I know that, and I'm ready for it, whether I get my past back or not,
but, Jordan, you're barely 20 years old, and you're acting a lot less.
you're not ready to take care of yourself.
do you have any idea how much you sound just like them?
you know, you told me how much I hated these people.
Yeah. - Sorry. No offense.
but--but to me, they seem like they genuinely care about us.
if I can forget why I was so angry at them, why can't you?
Hello! You lost your memory.
well, maybe you should, too.
no. Sam, wait.
don't you run away, too, please.
what's left of my mind is made up.
you're here early.
Hey, whatever's wrong, you don't have to hide it from me.
trust me, it's not anything you wanna hear about.
Melinda, you gotta stop thinking like that.
I'm your friend, and I love you.
I just-- I couldn't lie anymore...
so I started to tell Sam the truth.
he never doubted anything I told him.
but Sam...
you should have seen the look on his face.
it's like I told him I was abducted by aliens.
I'm so sorry.
I know this is probably the worst pain you have ever felt.
what do I do?
you get angry. That's what.
you gotta curse the universe and break some stuff.
breaking stuff, that sounds great.
it's the next stage after denial.
denial?
the stages of grief.
you're just going through what we all went through, what I went through with charlie.
some people call it denial.
some call it magical thinking.
whatever it is, it's--it's completely normal.
normal...
but not real.
unfortunately, no.
do you remember Jim's funeral...
when everybody started to dance and I told you afterwards
that Jim had made that happen and you said you believed it?
you said that you could feel him there, too.
that was different.
that's what you always do.
you talk to ghosts or whatever it is, and you make people's lives better.
well, how is it different this time?
it's different, because you aren't helping anyone.
you're not helping Sam, you're not helping his family, and you are definitely not helping yourself.
the last conscious decision my husband made was to risk everything just to be with me.
I am not gonna turn my back on that.
that's great. Believe he is out there somewhere.
you are not listening to me, as usual.
as usual?
I know it's bizarre.
all right, it's even hard for me to believe, but it's what happened.
Jim is not just "out there somewhere."
he's here, in this man's body.
Melinda-- - no, he took a chance...
out of love and out of loyalty for the one person
who meant everything to him, even though he knows it doesn't make any sense.
that is what love is, in case you're unsure.
so there's no middle ground?
I have to check my common sense at the door, or we can't be friends?
what's wrong?
rough day.
me, too. - You moving in?
what's wrong?
well, look, I been thinkin' about this.
you've been amazingly supportive.
uh, but it's just weird.
I mean, I don't even know you, and suddenly I'm movin' into your place.
and then what's even weirder is...
I mean, how I feel when we're together.
it's ok.
Ah, is it?
the point is...
no matter how painful this whole thing has been, I've been given a second chance,
and I realized that last night when I stood up to my parents and my sister.
OK. So, take your time.
do whatever it is that you need to do to get your memory back.
I don't know if I want to get it back.
look I don't know if the guy I was is the kind of guy I wanna be.
what kind of guy is that?
the kind that has an affair with a married woman.
tell him.
you deserve an explanation.
he deserves the truth.
but all I can give you right now is that I would have never cheated on my husband, ever.
will you tell me what is goin' on between us?
cause I'm confused, and whenever I'm around you, I can't think straight.
because I feel so familiar?
that's part of it.
do I feel like a friend?
at least.
that you can trust?
I think so.
then trust me.
I just don't know if I can trust myself.
Sam, look-- - look, thank you for helping me, ok?
thank you, but I think we're better off if...
maybe I just go away, huh?
go? Where?
I guess I'll know when I get there.
Oh, Melinda.
is she here? Where's sam? Where did you send him?
I don't know.
Oh, terrific.
the boy can't remember a damn thing, and now he's out wandering all alone.
do you really think that's what he needs?
no. Actually, I wanted him to stay.
well, what are we supposed to do now?
I have no idea.
but if he ever gives you a second chance, I hope you don't blow it like you did the first time.
I beg your pardon?
I know what it's like to lose someone and to not know if it's for good.
I know that impulse to do everything humanly poible just to get them back.
sometimes impulses are wrong.
are you a parent?
no, and I'm not a doctor either, but believe me when I say that
you have to start preparing yourself for the fact that your son may never remember who he was.
look, Ms. Gordon
and you should be grateful for that. You know why?
because you'll actually have a son.
at some point, he's gonna need his family, and he will call,
but all he's gonna remember is who you are now, so wouldn't you want that to be a good thing?
what is that supposed to mean, exactly?
you've held on to your children so tight that you've lost them both.
but there's still time to maybe get them back, but not if you keep making the same mistakes.
where are you?
at the cafe, doing homework.
I thought I'd surprise you and stop by and take you out for something to eat, but you're not here.
where? - At the courts.
isn't your shooting clinic on mondays?
OK, promise you won't get mad.
well, I promise I will if you don't start talkin'.
mom, there's no shooting clinic on mondays.
what?
I used to meet Jim there on mondays to practice,
but I didn't tell you it was just him and me,
becae I was afraid if you knew, you'd make me come and work at the store instead.
Ned, I wish you would have
mom, please don't be mad.
I'm not mad. I'm just
I have to call you back.
Delia, right?
what are you doin' here?
promise not to laugh?
I have no idea.
I was drivin' out of town. I was leaving...
and then suddenly I got this feeling that I was supposed to be somewhere, somewhere important.
so I just came here.
weird, isn't it?
Yeah. You could say that.
I was hoping someone would recognize me...
then could tell me why I had to be here.
it's really you.
sorry?
I think you could be right.
I think you are supposed to be somewhere.
where?
you tried.
I will never forget that.
if you never forgive me, I will understand,
but I couldn't just sit around and do nothing when this whole thing was ready to blow away.
what whole thing? What are you talking about?
you and Jim, your future together, your whole everything.
are you drunk?
no, there is no time to explain, Mel. He's outside.
who? - Jim. I mean Sam
Jim--Sam-- whatever the hell his name is.
but I convinced him to come back and talk to you, but you have to figure out what to do next.
where did you?
he was on the basketball court on the way out of town.
I saw him, I stopped, and I convinced him to come back and talk to you.
why did you?
because he was waiting for Ned, and I finay understood.
what?
that I was wrong. Ok? About pretty much everything.
and I know that we are gonna talk about this endlessly in the future,
but right now, you have to go outside and make sure that Jim does not get back on that road and go out of town.
you keep calling him Jim.
that's who he is, isn't he?
OK. Stop. Go. It's ok.
got my best friend back.
OK, quit your blubbering. - You made me blubber.
Oh, wait a sec. - Delia.
there's a stain on it. You gotta really be presentable. You got any lip gloss?
no, if it's Jim, I don't need lip gloss.
do you know how lucky you are?
you are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.
OK. Go. Go, go, go. - Ok.
you're back.
I apologize for before.
I got a little overdramatic. - It's ok. I don't
I mean, if I'm on some search to find out what feels right in my life, you know,
what places and what people, you know, I should take baby steps.
I should start at square one and not square 10. And if that does
you know what? Whatever your reasons are, I'm fine with it.
you don't need to explain anything.
maybe that's best for now, for both of us.
OK. - Ok.
can I move this stuff into your garage?
Yeah. I'll help you. - Thanks.
Hey, you guys need some help?
sure. - Sure.
did I mention my, uh...
parents called my sister and apolized for a lifetime of controlling behavior?
and then Jordan just got up and went back home with them.
I had no idea.
Oh, yeah? Because when I asked them why the big change of heart,
they said that they had talked to you and that you had talked sense to them.
how'd you do that?
I have a few talents.
a few talents? That's what you're gonna leave me with?
OK. No explanations.
I'll be right there.
Hey, Sam, why don't you, uh...
show me what you're plannin' to do with the space in here?
I know what you're thinking.
it's a good thing you didn't listen to me.
I beg your pardon?
if there's one thing I thought being dead would make me an expert on,
it was being dead, but I was wrong.
that's your specialty, like you said.
I've been at it a while.
I wanted them to have the closure, but you held out for more.
you gave them their family back.
are you ready?
to go into the light?
it's been following me around all day.
but there is one thing I wanted to say to you before I went in.
what?
what your husband did might just be a miracle.
I hope it is, because after a lifetime of this, a miracle's what you deserve.
Hey, uh, you ok?
Yeah.
No!
I want you to remember me this way, please.
no. Not you.
I will always love you, Melinda.
Oh, please not you.
I am so empty without you.
I'm not going anywhere. - No, you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
Jim, no!
you're back.
do I know you?
look, I see the same guy that you see.
different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes,
and Jim is in there somewhere.
he just has to be.
do you believe in the afterlife?
wait, you're not gonna tell me you think I'm your husband reincarnated,
because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
it's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage.
and you could live there while you do the work,
just until you figure out your next move.
will you tell me what is going on between us?
do you know how lucky you are?
you are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.
Oh! Oh. Hey. You're up early.
Hey, Sam. Yeah, just... you know.
trying to be good.
Yeah, me too. Get a workout in.
so...
you want to, uh...
together? - Ooh, I don't know.
no, that's stupid of me. - I'm sorry. What?
this is probably a time when, you know, you want to be alone.
you know, after what you've been through...
no, it's not that.
get your stuff together. - Right.
something you probably did with your husband, huh? In the morning?
I don't want to get in your way.
no. Not at all. Um...
he worked a lot of weird hours, and liked to sleep in a lot.
you're really not in my way at all.
I should...Well...
Ah, nice work, Sam. Um...
have a good morning.
I'll run that way.
I'll go this way.
see ya. - See ya.
why couldn't I just say "your legs are longer than mine, "and I might not be able to keep up.
what is so hard with saying that?
well, it's probably better than saying, "hey, you're the love of my life in a new body, "and every time I see you,
my knees go weak.
Ugh. my knees, my legs.
I fumble with words, it's like my voice gets shaky.
I'm a total dork... whoa!
Hey, Sam.
Hey. How you doin', Sam?
Hey, Delia. Hey look...
I've had this stuff in my truck for a couple of days... unh!
and I've been meaning to give it to you, but every time I see you, I just forget.
it's not like I don't forget everything else I've done in my life, I mean.
how to read a blueprint I made, the name of my dog.
you have a dog?
no. But, I mean, that's what I think about when I wake up, you know?
anyhow, this is all yours to keep, or sell, or toss.
wow, you've got some nice things in here.
where did you get them?
well, I got a job doing some demos on a big house off of route 18.
they're getting rid of all the hardware - Ooh!
Hey, do you have a first aid kit I can...
it's ok. it's just a cut.
here. Here you go.
you look a little pale.
you have got to stop skipping breakfast.
it's, you know, low blood sugar.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, you said that there was more stuff?
Yeah, in my truck, but...
there's also tons more back at the site.
can I go look at it?
Yeah, I was going there right now.
Yeah, we started the job from the back of the house.
I don't know if the owner wants to gut it or tear it down, but uh...
I don't think you're gonna find too much high-end stuff here.
is there water around here anywhere?
water? why?
well, the tiles. I just was...
I don't know. -Is there a fountain or a pool?
there's a well right there.
is that what you were looking for?
why not, huh?
it is a wishing well.
careful what you wish for.
are you sure this little girl is...
what do you call it? - Attached to him?
Yeah. - No.
but as soon as Sam made his wish, she was right out of the well,
standing next to him, warning.
warning you or him?
who knows? Maybe anybody who comes by the well.
but she was definitely focused on him.
well, do you know what he wished?
you got me.
it had to be to get his memory back.
and if so, what's the problem?
we all know it's Jim's spirit.
you know it. Even I know .
what? What's that look for?
believing me.
so, what are you going to do?
stop worrying about myself and the things I can't control...
help a dead little girl whose spirit is stuck down a well.
do you know if she ever lived in the house?
the last owner was a widow.
she had children, but no daughters.
the place is, like, 100 years old.
so, you're searching for what?
a missing or dead child over the last century?
basically.
or I wait until she appears again and then try to figure out if her warning was a threat or a promise.
look at this.
it's still good. Why are they tossing it?
contractor wants all new, you know?
man, I think I just lost an eardrum.
you heard that?
Yeah, it was Bob's truck.
but twice?
I don't think so.
help me with this. - Yeah.
Sam, you ok? -Yeah.
it's Melinda.
hang on a second.
you just got in. How did you get...
uh, naked? Um, sorry.
let me turn down the radio.
sorry. I had the radio on a little loud.
didn't you hear me? -No. Um...
hang on a second.
so, uh, hey. What's up?
what happened? Did you hurt yourself?
well, not that I know of.
and nothing that my doctor here or the one back home knows about, either.
what do you mean?
I thought it had something to do with the car accident.
but that turns out to be a straight up head injury.
I mean, sure. It could cause muscle trauma.
why am I feeling it now?
when did it start?
well, it's weird.
the first time I felt it, I heard a car backfire.
it was like a rifle shot.
I heard it twice, but it only happened once.
I'm sure I just imagined it, but...
well, don't brush it off. I mean, it could be a memory.
you know? One that you want to forget,
but it could lead to others.
well, I hope so. I mean,
I'm going through all these boxes,
all my old stuff.
just trying to jog something loose.
And?
I don't know. I listen to CDs,
I see pictures of people I'm supposed to have known, you know?
I have a cell phone here. What do I do?
I call these people and say, "hey. do you remember me?
cause I don't.
you said that it happened at work.
were you near the well?
Nah, I was in and out of the house, you know.
coming and going past the well.
and has anything weird happened there?
to you or anyone?
no. Not that I can think of. Why?
what about the owners? I mean,
have you talked to anyone who lived in the house?
I'm just working for the contractor.
what are you getting at? Why are you so curious about the well?
I... It's my business.
in a way. You know?
antiques, wells...
I mean, there's actually a market for that kind of thing,
believe it or not.
I should go.
all right.
sorry about being naked.
who are you? What do you want?
look, talk to me, but just leave him alone.
I made your, uh, chicken with the tahini sauce.
and a good salad.
good, you're eating.
Yeah.
that's me. I am eating.
Ugh. Something that looks inedible
and totally raw.
well, what'd you cook the chicken on?
on? A pan. - I mean what temperature?
I told you for an hour at...
Yeah, I did an hour.
in the oven?
in the oven? You...you said on for an hour.
no. No, no, no.
that was the pan searing.
I said inside the oven at 425.
well, I didn't hear that part.
Delia, I miss him so much.
and you're right. I mean,
he's keeping his distance
because he thinks I'm grieving.
and the truth is...
I am.
I just miss him.
you know, and today...
today he remembered something from his life...
I mean Jim's. Or at least I think he did.
well, that's great, honey.
no, it's not. Because...
he remembered being shot.
you know? And I think...
I think the ghost is responsible for that
if that's what he wished for.
I'm... I'm so sorry.
it just scares me.
you know, what he might have to go through
to come back to me. And...
what if he doesn't want to?
he already came back to you.
I want you to remember that.
Jim did all of this for you.
could you just...
stay on the phone with me for, like, 5 more minutes?
then I promise we'll both go to sleep.
Yeah, sure.
we can talk all night if you want to.
I warned you.
stay away from the well.
my arms and legs.
did someone do that to you?
terrible things will happen if you don't stay away.
so what is it about explicitly being told to stay away
that inspires you to come running to this house?
I can't exactly search for clues
with everyone working here, especially Sam.
how was she when you saw her before?
one piece or chopped liver?
she was all in one piece.
must have happened after she died.
Yeah, for transport.
for some killers, dismemberment's a fetish,
but for most it's a matter of convenience.
I mean, how else are you gonna stuff the body in the trunk?
your encyclopedic knowledge of the depraved is awe-inspiring.
and if you've got a crowbar in that snazzy little tote,
I'll be impressed.
they didn't even lock it.
come in.
look at all these newspapers.
Oh, my god.
welcome to the nest of the giant pack rat.
who lived here?
a widow in her sixties.
heart attack.
you know they linked hoarding to perfectionism?
it's ironic, isn't it? Because people who have it end up living like this.
Yeah. Not the most inviting place for a kid to visit.
do you think that she was drawn to the property because of the well?
maybe it's just where she wound up.
nearest dispose-all where the killer could dump her body.
wait.
swing that back over there.
what is that?
forget transport. I'm thinking fetish.
how long has this house been empty?
I don't know.
the widow died a few months ago.
and has it always been empty, or could someone else be living here.
I no longer care if the neighbors call the cops.
what is this?
they're wishes.
a wish for new toys,
a million dollars.
a teacup terrier who won't bite.
it's like they were all written by children.
Santa would have been a better bet.
wait, look at this one.
this looks like adult handwriting.
I wish he could know she was here.
I gotta say,
it's awfully nice of someone who chops up a little girl
to leave a note. For who?
the girl's father? Wishing he'd learn the truth?
so nice of that old lady pack rat to save it.
um, she saved everything.
meaning she had no idea there was a little girl down the well?
meaning we don't know if there's a little girl in the well.
I'm not going down that well.
I don't care if you have flippers and a mask in that bag, - I'm not going. - Ok, fine.
I just think she's haunting it 'cause it has something to do with her death.
good morning.
Eli, right? - Yeah. Sam, hey.
we were just... - We went to this, um...
it's early, right?
Yeah. It's morning.
I'm...I'm just gonna read the sports.
maybe I'll remember what team I like.
Oh, hey. Melinda?
remember you were asking me about the history of that well?
you had a buyer or something?
Yeah, right.
Yeah. Well, I asked around. It turns out that the contractors were hired by the old lady's son.
he pretty much owns it now.
he's staying at a place called the, um...
Grandview Court. His last name's Ackerman.
Travis Ackerman. - Great. Thanks.
sure. - Can I ask you a...
a strange question?
what did you wish for at the well?
I can't tell you that.
might not come true.
I cannot wait for this ghost to cross over as soon as possible.
let's go see that pack rat's son.
Travis Ackerman.
let me do it. - Are you sure?
yeah no problem.
you said you called because you have a buyer
for some of the items at the house?
I thought that we got anything of value out of there.
I was visiting a friend up there,
and I saw these dolls.
dolls?
doll pieces.
that's weird.
do you know what I'm talking about?
there was a... a pile of them.
you know? Arms and legs.
they were next to a box of notes,
or, um... Wishes. Actually. I think.
you know what? -I... I do know what you're talking about.
I found a bunch of broken dolls.
they were yanked apart.
um, somebody left them with a note - At the foot of the well. - The well?
Yeah, there's this old well on our property.
it's a wishing well, actually.
neighborhood kids knew about it.
I was already 15 when we moved into that old place,
but, uh, every once in a while, I would see them out there.
of course, they would run the minute anyone from the house came out.
Why's that? - You know, uh,
old, creaky place near the new subdivision.
we were instantly the spooky house.
I was going through a bit of a rough patch at the time.
and I kinda figured if I could help
grant some little girl's wish, why not?
so I, uh, I took the broken parts...
which, big surprise, it sounds like my mother saved,
and I, uh, I left a new doll.
and the next day, it was gone.
did you have any idea who the girl was?
no. I only ever saw her from a distance.
she was alone.
no more than 10, long dark hair.
you know, the truth is I learned to keep my distance from that well.
I kinda wish everyone would.
why is that?
you'll think I'm nuts.
it's unlikely.
I can usually tell.
all right. Um...
when I was 18, I...
I got a full scholarship to an out-of-state school.
and then I found out that my girlfriend was pregnant.
I didn't say it was all your fault...
you know, I saw my future slipping away.
I would be one more thing that my mom could hang onto.
you know, me, Allison, and a baby all stuck in that house.
and... - We will be happy.
I wished.
with Allison right there, I wished...
that she weren't pregnant.
I said I'd give anything.
Allison's car was parked out front, right along the side of the road.
and these, uh, these racers... these cyclists
came flying down the hill.
and she got hit.
she lost the baby, and I went away to school
and she never spoke to me again.
so...
wish granted.
but I'm sure that you don't believe in
all of that stuff anyway.
you'd be surprised what I believe.
let me tell you what a friend of mine saw down your well.
so just like that the son agrees to drain the well?
it was an easy sell.
the ghost got the guy halfway believing
she was real just by granting his wish.
he feels if she's down there, the family deserves to know.
well, that's cooperative.
not what you'd expect from a brutal killer.
I didn't get that from this guy.
what about his mother?
she seemed like a nice lady
with an anxiety disorder.
what? What am I missing?
well, I'm just thinking about the wish
that Travis had granted.
I mean, it certainly proves the ghost's point.
be careful what you wish for.
Yeah, but what caused the little girl's death?
because she keeps warning us against wishes
so it obviously has to be something that she wished for.
that ought to be easy to figure out.
a little girl who wished for something.
Yeah, but maybe we have more than that.
I mean, now we know when she lived, right?
so what if she's the girl that Travis Ackerman saw leaving doll parts?
the severed doll parts.
it's got to be her.
Yeah, but when did she go missing?
well, Travis said he was 15 when he moved in.
Yeah, and he left for school when he was 18.
and he's late 20s now. I mean, how many girls could go deceased or missing in Grandview in a 3-year span?
Gretchen Dennis. That's her.
missing since 1996.
you were right. And, uh...
it's pretty awful.
I'm sorry.
thanks for doing this.
Yeah. Yeah, um...
is the girl here?
I mean, the spirit that you saw?
no. - Well, maybe, now that they've found her body, she's at peace?
it's a step.
what did you tell the police?
just that I was having it drained before I sold the place.
you know, it's an insurance hazard.
and I didn't want anyone getting hurt.
um, Allison? Could...Could a ghost have done that to her?
I mean, caused an accident like that?
I don't know. Maybe.
I'm sorry.
help me!
what? What is it?
the little girl.
she might not be the only one that died.
that was fast.
neighbors have built a shrine already.
Yeah, it's all over the local news.
Gretchen's been missing for 12 years.
are we gonna to talk to the family?
it seems a little soon.
no, the ghost.
look at me, Clay!
I hate you! Look at me!
look at what you did to me, Clay.
I hate you, Clay.
what is it? What's wrong?
he did this to me.
he killed me.
who is that?
my brother.
I just can't believe that a little boy would slice his sister into bits.
Oh, he could.
you're the search queen. Type in "sororicide."
that's sister-killing. You'll get 100 hits.
clay may have killed her, but he didn't chop her.
how do you know that? - I just got an e-mail.
from my friend work at the morgue.
even after 12 years, her skeleton was still intact.
there were some minor fractures,
but nothing that indicated dismemberment.
what about the boy?
I mean, were there any other bones down in the well?
Nope. One set of bones.
but you said he was a vision, not a spirit, right?
so that means what happened to him was something the little girl experienced.
OK.
what if the armless boy that you saw was Clay's first kill?
and she witnessed it.
so if those were her dolls that were chopped into pieces...
that could have been a warning.
she could have seen what her brother had done
and she was gonna narc on him.
and to shut her up, he threw her down a well?
well...
it's hard to believe.
but I guess either way, we have to talk to the parents.
Melinda, they just learned that their daughter is never coming home alive.
Yeah, but they also don't know that she still needs their help. And yours.
look, Eli, I'm serious.
you're a very experienced grief counselor.
you saw the news you're here to help,
and you couldn't stop wondering about...
Gretchen's relationship with her brother?
are you asking us how he handled the news?
Oh. well, he can't even talk about it.
but that's nothing new.
clay...
clay is so smart.
he's such a good athlete.
he was a great ball player.
but when Gretchen went missing, he was devastated.
he lost interest in everything. It was...
it was like we lost him, too.
how do you mean?
"survivor's guilt."
that's what the family therapist called it.
I understand.
but is it possible for Clay, would he have anything specific to feel guilty about?
in terms of Gretchen? Did they get along?
well, they fought like any siblings.
he was older. - Typical boy.
and Gretchen was such a little girl.
it's gonna seem odd, but did she like to play with dolls?
don't most girls?
what's odd about that?
did Clay ever do anything to her dolls?
not really.
well, they... No, wait, Aaron, they did.
when, uh, when he was trying to get back at her.
for who knows what, he hid them. All of them.
and Gretchen just about lost her mind.
and that was all the ammunition he ever needed.
aaron, do you remember that? Yeah.
he used to do terrible things.
he would hide them, hang them...
cut them into pieces?
well, yeah.
I know that sounds awful,
but we just thought that's the way kids are.
aren't they?
I have a delivery for Andrew's meatpacking.
I'm looking for the main office.
third floor. I think someone's still up there
if you need a signature.
Oh, sorry about that. I'm on the clock.
Thanks. -You're welcome.
No! No!
no, no, help!
please, somebody help me! please!
Hello?
check this out.
can we talk later?
I called the brother Clay, at home and at work.
he never called me back.
so, basically you're calling to tell me
that you have nothing to tell me.
sort of. You said the ghost was pissed - I'm just saying... - Oh. Well, that's great.
well, thank you. Um, OK. Bye-bye.
morning. - Hey, good morning.
how are you? -I'm good, I'm good.
and this is for you.
I knew you'd be in a bit of a rush.
I wanted to get it to you before you, uh...
ate. Or didn't. It's not too late.
you're not gonna be late for work, are you?
no. No, this is...
it's really nice of you.
it's payback for all the good stuff.
you got me from the store. Eat up, now.
how is it? Good? Bad?
did you use orange rinds in the waffles?
good! I did, yeah. Orange rinds,organic maple syrup, a little fruit,roasted pecans.
wait. You're not allergic to those?
no.
no, it's just something my husband did.
sorry. - Don't be.
really.
it's perfect.
I'm sorry I keep bringing him up. It's just...
how could you not?
I mean, uh...
look, you can talk about him to me anytime you want.
anytime.
which is something I have loads of now. Time.
Oh, that's right. I heard the news.
I'm sorry. - Whatever.
I guess all the work's been halted.
so it goes.
they found the body of a child in that well.
you know, the well you were so curious about.
I gotta ask you, um...
what's the deal with that?
um, I don't know.
I hope maybe the police can find out something.
I was really talking about you.
you know, all the questions you were asking about the well.
and then when we were there,
it's like you could sense something.
I mean, it freaked you out.
you're not psychic, are you?
uh, no.
no, I'm not psychic.
you're certainly popular.
Hello, Eli.
Mel. This time I have something.
Clay's dispatcher just called me back.
seems our ghost has been hard at work, putting Clay on disability leave.
what happened?
he had an accident.
I know you're gonna say I was getting ahead of myself,
reaching out to the brother, who probably killed his little sister.
manslaughter? Murder? Take your pick.
how about you start a phone call with, "can you talk, or is this a bad time?
no. I want you to pick one, seriously.
Oh, I get it. Because Sam might be there.
and you don't want him to know you have superpowers.
right. - Got it. Will do.
but come on. You gonna pick or what?
I'm inclined to go with manslaughter,
Gretchen's death being some kind of accident.
but there's something that keeps bothering me.
one-armed Joe?
OK, fine. That poor boy you saw with his arm cut off.
you're thinking if Clay did kill his sister in some sort of weird, rough, freak tumble play accident.
who's the armless kid?
Yeah, and how is he related to Clay?
I called the school looking for a yearbook.
see if you could I. d. old Joe as one of his classmates.
then I remembered. Clay was a little league star.
so maybe Joe was one of the kids on his team.
I don't know. Maybe he's lost his arm in some kind of freak accident that Gretchen saw.
a double accident? - Yeah.
that's him. That's the boy I saw.
that's one-armed Joe?
that's Clay Dennis, Gretchen's brother.
I'm telling you, that's him.
he can't be both Butcher and victim.
Gretchen blames him, so he has to be involved somehow.
well, if he wants to hang onto the rest of his limbs,
he'd better start talking.
you know, the warning label on these
says that you're not supposed to drive.
I don't think that's a problem.
there's another warning you should know. Um...
I see spirits.
I've seen your sister. She's angry at you.
OK. You saw my sister's ghost.
Yes.
and the fact that I talk to ghosts
is not something I like to admit
unless I feel like someone's life might be in danger.
look, lady. What happened to my arm?
that was just a... freak thing.
no, I don't think so.
it's too similar to a vision that I had.
you were a kid, 10 or 11.
and that same arm was injured. Missing, in fact.
OK, please stop.
I know exactly what you're talking about,
but how...
Oh, my god.
because my sister told you.
in a way.
she showed me severed arms and legs.
I had no way to connect it,
except to her dolls and what you had done to them.
what I did to them.
she tell you what I did to her?
did she tell you that?
I was so mean to her.
she was such a stubborn tag-along.
she was always getting into my stuff.
move!
there were times when I literally hated her.
this one time, I was convinced that she slit my tires.
what is the matter with you?
I didn't touch your stupid bike!
clay, what did you do to your sister? what's wrong with you?
I didn't do it, I promise!
so I went nuts on her dolls.
hiding them, hanging them.
she'd run, tell my parents,
and write down in this little notepad of hers,
you know, about how she hated me right back.
writing those stupid notes won't do anything.
shut up and leave me alone.
one day, I don't even know what she did
to bug me, really,
but I just chopped up all of her dolls.
mom! Clay killed my dolls!
I got grounded for 2 weeks.
I was home alone,
saw her latest entry.
she'd torn out the page, but I could see the imprint.
she wrote, "I wish Clay's arms and legs were cut off."
she wished for you the same fate as her dolls.
and when my parents were gone,
I made that wish come true.
help me! Is this what you wanted? What did you do to me?
I tried to stop her before she could call my parents or 911.
I heard the screen door to the kitchen slam.
Gretchen, come back. It was just a joke.
she was already gone.
she didn't come back that night.
or the next, or the next.
I don't know what I was thinking.
she was 8 years old.
I heard my mom sobbing every night.
how could this have happened?
I knew.
but what I didn't know
was what happened to Gretchen after I scared her away.
do you?
no.
but I'll find out.
I promise.
I saw you talking to him.
Gretchen, he didn't mean to hurt you.
he's been scared for you ever since.
I've been in the dark,
in the cold.
all this time I was afraid to go home.
because you thought your wish had come true?
but he's fine. It was just a trick.
no, he's not fine. - He's alive,
and I'm dead and it's all his fault.
he would give anything to take it back.
there are no take backs when it comes to the well.
ask your friend Sam.
I don't get it. Why is the ghost going after Sam?
I thought she was mad at her brother.
I'm dealing with an angry 8-year-old, who keeps changing the rules as she goes.
none of it explains how she got down the well.
she wrote a note
asking for the well's help in punishing her brother.
that's how this all started. But then, Eli and I found this.
with her dolls at the old house.
I wish he could know she was here.
did her brother write this? - No, I don't think so.
where are those tiles that Sam brought?
I put them over here.
I wasn't sure if you were serious
about selling it as a garden fixture.
what do the tiles have to do with any of this?
this is how I'm gonna get Gretchen to tell me the truth.
make a wish of your very own.
hide it deep within the stone.
Gretchen, you thought the well had real powers
and that's how your brother got hurt.
can I speak to her?
she's here. She's angry.
like she was the time that she made a wish wanting to hurt you.
hide it deep within the stone.
is it still in the stone?
I watched it fall away over time.
years and years I was down there.
because of you.
look, whatever she's saying,
please just tell her I'm sorry.
she's sorry, too.
even if she doesn't remember feeling that way.
when you thought your wish had come true
and you saw your brother bleeding,
maybe even dying...
you came here to take back your wish, didn't you?
it was so hard to reach.
you said there were no take backs.
you're right.
even though you want to,
no one can change what's happened.
but you can grant one more wish.
you can help your brother forgive himself.
all I ever wanted to do was be with him.
no matter what he did.
she always looked up to you.
she wanted to be with you.
but I was so mean to you.
and you were just a kid.
you were a kid, too.
will you tell him I love him and forgive him?
I will.
she understands now.
that it was a horrible accident, same goes for you.
she wasn't in the well when your girlfriend had her accident.
there was no spirit, no magic.
you didn't make that happen.
Yeah, I didn't need a ghost's help.
I mean, I might not have gotten what I wanted,
but I definitely got what I deserved.
Allison, are you ok?
go away!
go away!
Allison... - Get away from me!
still, I can't help but wishing...
wishing you did something different.
so does she.
who?
the woman who left the note.
the one who came here
with your daughter.
of course.
the other note.
I wish that he could know she was here.
what...what other note? What is she saying?
I think she's talking about your girlfriend,
Allison.
12 years. And she'd been living here the whole time.
in Lewiston. Half an hour away.
she was hurt.
let him think that she had lost the baby
so she wouldn't force a child on him.
didn't she think he have the right to know?
I think she wanted him, too.
it's just, as the years passed,
it got harder to tell him.
so, the visits to the well.
I guess so.
so far, so good. Right.
what? Is she here?
figured while I'm here,
I might as well help people.
like your friend Sam.
Sam?
it was dark for so long.
now it's so warm and bright.
what did you do for Sam?
I gave him what he wanted.
something he really wanted.
turns out it was something he already had.
what?
a piece of his life back.
which life?
thank you.
it's been kind of a weird day,
and I didn't know who else I could talk to about it.
OK.
I was going through all my stuff,
and I found a key.
I know it's strange, I've been hoping...
wishing for a clue, something to tell me who I was.
right?
guess I got more than I bargained for.
are you sure this belongs to you?
Yeah.
my name was right on the receipt, Sam Lucas.
I bought that less than a month ago.
question is,
who did I buy it for?
No!
I'll always love you, Melinda.
please. not you.
you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
Jim, no!
you're back.
do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see,
different hair, nose, eyes.
it's not Jim. he's in there somewhere.
he just has to be.
you're not gonna tell me that you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
it's not much. But maybe you can help me finish my garage.
and you could live there while you do the work.
just until you figure out your next move.
do you know how lucky you are?
you are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.
that's strange. I've been hoping for a clue,
something to tell me who I was.
guess I got more than I bargained for.
I bought that less than a month ago.
question is... who did I buy it for?
Hey!
Hey. you're looking chipper this morning.
that's how a morning off effects me.
Oh, yeah. you got a little...
thank you. - Yeah, sure.
where you running off to?
the farmer's market. We're supposed to meet Delia there at 9: 00.
we are?
Oh, that's right.
Melinda, I'm so sorry. I gotta do a job.
Yeah...yeah. anything interesting?
well, if you call making kitchen cabinets interesting, then yeah.
cabinets are great. I mean, I love cabinets.
you found that... that ring...
did you ever look into it?
right. yeah.
the ring... - Right.
did you find out anything?
you don't want to know. sorry.
of course I want to know. that's all I want... is to know.
Charlie used to say that. drove me nuts.
Jim never did. because Jim was never a question dodger.
what does that even mean, "you don't want to know"?
well, with Charlie it either meant that he didn't want to talk about it, Or he didn't want me to talk about it,
or that he actually wanted to talk, but wasn't sure if I did.
well, thank you. That's helpful.
so, what do you think Sammeant?
what else could he mean?
he found her... his girlfriend,
his soon-to-be future wife.
that's why he blew me off today.
that's why he's been so distracted lately.
because he found her.
and he's probably gonna get on a plane.
he's gonna fly all the way to Michigan or Paris
or wherever it is she is right now.
Mel, I seriously doubt that Jim's spirit
would have gone through all the trouble of taking over Sam's body
just to run off with another woman.
please tell me nobody heard me say that.
Yeah. but he doesn't even know that he's Jim.
I mean, what if he smells her perfume
and he gets confused or attracted or...
honey, you are spinning.
I wouldn't have to if he wasn't dodging my questions.
it's just too loaded.
I mean, I don't know how to approach it...
Oh, you could.
that's perfect!
it's not perfect. it's bruised.
they all are. see?
no, not again!
I'm sorry. Did I do that?
no, it happens all the time.
and you wonder why?
well if I could get some help around here!
I need to get home and cook dinner.
well, maybe I can help you.
Oh thank god, finally somebody with manners!
you know I have been coming here every Saturday for God knows how long,
all of a sudden he decides to ignore me.
how long do you think?
I... I'm not sure.
let me guess, a ghost wants pie?
I'm not sure what she wants.
I don't even think she knows she's dead.
wait!
could I, get 4 of those? thank you.
they're for you. maybe I could give you a ride home.
Oh, that's so sweet. thank you.
my name is Tammy. Tammy Gardner.
you...you did get the organic ones, right?
you know what, I better go and check.
did you just offer to give a ride home to a ghost?
only because she doesn't realize that she's dead.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Melinda Gordon. Are you Mr. Gardner?
Yes, I am. I'm sorry.
like I tell all you realtors, we're not selling.
actually, I'm here about your wife.
my wife? oh, she's not here. she's at the market.
did something happen?
how long ago did she leave?
over an hour ago. she was due back...
Ah, there she is now!
Hey, sweetheart.
who's she?
I was getting worried.
Melinda, this is my wife, Elizabeth.
unless you two know each other?
no.
no, the thing is I own an antique store in town,
and someone left a vase on consignment,
and I was just trying to track her down.
hmm. that wasn't me. I'm sorry.
you know, just so there are no mix-ups,
the woman who left the vase,
her name was Tammy... Tammy Gardner.
Tammy, um...
Tammy was my first wife. We're divorced.
Oh. you wouldn't have a recent address change for her maybe?
no, I'm sorry.
I haven't heard from her since she walked out on me 2 years ago.
wish I could've been more help.
good day.
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you.
but I went by your store. But it was closed.
and your address was listed ...
so is my phone number.
I know, I'm sorry.
I wanted to see to you in person.
I need you to tell me what you know about my wife.
when exactly did she leave?
just about 2 years ago, October 15.
I remember that day because it was our fourth anniversary.
at first I wasn't worried.
she'd disappeared before. Sort of a pattern for her.
but she'd always come back after a couple of days.
when she didn't show up after 3 days,
I knew something was wrong.
I just can't understand why she hasn't contacted me.
you said this was a pattern? her disappearing?
maybe in a way it's good she hasn't contacted me.
means she's probably staying out of trouble.
what kind of trouble?
she had mood swings.
what did she do?
she couldn't stand feeling confined.
she'd run away, then come back,
looking disheveled and confused.
that doesn't sound at all like the Tammy I met.
that's part of the illness.
I mean, she could be delightful and happy one day,
and then... and then depressed and angry the next.
was she ever diagnosed?
Oh, no. no. she refused to see a doctor.
I talked to plenty myself.
said it was some sort of bipolar disorder.
I loved her so much.
but it's so painful living with someone you can't break through to.
I know what you mean.
why didn't you tell that poor guy
that his ex-wife is haunting him?
because I don't want to make things worse...
Roger's already got a ghost in his house because of me.
besides, I need a little more information, like how she died.
do you still think there's a chance that she could've moved on?
I can hope. something tells me she'll be here soon.
because this is where I saw her yesterday.
which would tell us she's still stuck in the loop,
still playing Suzie homemaker.
I'm just wondering if her imprint has something to do with mental illness and not her death.
she's stuck in a loop because she's loopy? makes sense.
you're not helping.
no, it does. really.
people in the manic stage of bipolar disorder
often have trouble assimilating anything negative...
like being dead, for instance?
that's the fourth person you let go before me.
I just need my husband's shirt...
it's the blue one in the plastic,
and I said no plastic.
Hi.
OK. 3 pieces. - Thanks.
somebody help!
stop this thing!
somebody help!
Tammy! stop it!
Oh, I'm so glad you're here! It's a blue shirt, and Roger likes light starch if you could just...
we are not gonna pick up your husband's dry cleaning.
you don't need to take care of him anymore.
it's time for you to move on.
I can't do that.
what would happen to my family?
I need to take care of them, of Roger.
no, you don't. they'll be fine ...
stop it. Don't say that. Roger needs me.
he has a new wife.
OK? he's moved on.
you can let go now, really. it's ok.
why are you being so mean? You helped me before.
why can't you help me now?
make those people listen to me!
they can't. not anymore.
the day that they stopped hearing you was the day that you died.
look, you know, don't you? what happened?
Oh dear...
there was something...
it happened after I fell asleep. I remember thinking
it was strange how fast I was falling asleep.
and then what happened?
I was floating.
there was a big grassy field
and lots of tall trees below me.
my car was there.
and colors,
lots of bright colors flying all around me.
Oh, no... I have to get home.
lots of colors? Sounds like a hallucination.
yeah or maybe not.
she said that she was above a field,
there were tall trees.
she disappeared in October.
is this what you saw that day, Tammy?
kites? floating colors? Am I close?
hot? cold? lukewarm?
crap. need some dialogue here,
a little back and forth.
it's not so easy when you have a client that's invisible.
OK, I've hiked far enough.
and I draw the line at thistles.
what's that? look, I'm sweating now.
so if it turns out to be another dead end...
no. no!
this can't be true.
I can't be dead. Not like this.
I told my friend detective Blair that I found the body hiking,
as opposed to breaking and entering,
which is how I found the last dead body
that I called into her.
how many times can you do that before they haul you away?
well, they haven't locked me up yet.
that's wildly reassuring. that's nice.
at least now we know how and when she died.
possibly why she's stuck here... out of guilt.
because she abandoned her husband and kids?
Yeah. maybe that's why she's trying so hard now
to take care of them.
I just don't understand
why this ghost is so hard to get through to.
I mean, she's seen her husband's new wife,
her own dead body...
you'd think that would bring up something. but it hasn't it.
if she's drawn to that square,
maybe something happened there
that she doesn't want to remember.
like, an affair?
Roger said she used to disappear a lot,
maybe she was meeting someone there.
right, maybe she was seeing someone and her husband never knew.
Yeah. or he did, and didn't want to believe it.
Hey, Roger.
it's Melinda Gordon. I was hoping we could talk.
so, call me. ok. thanks.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I see that woman in my house. something's very wrong.
it's because you don't belong there anymore.
and you know that somewhere deep down.
you left the house. and that's hard.
but you really have to remember why.
I remember... trying to make Roger happy.
how I felt like it was the most important thing I could ever do.
and... and how I'd always worry about my kids.
I don't... I don't have any kids.
but I used to feel that way about my husband.
spirits often don't remember things because somewhere deep down,
they don't want to.
why wouldn't I want to?
usually guilt.
you talk about your family a lot.
maybe that's what you feel guilty about? Or maybe...
maybe you just need to say goodbye to your children.
I don't know. God.
I can't think about it anymore.
I have to get home.
I can't be late.
Hey, what's up? Come on in.
Oh, thanks.
you look like you're running off.
Yeah, it's really urgent.
what is?
I have to get to the laundromat before every T-shirt I own starts standing up by itself.
Oh, so that's your...
you're not planning a trip?
no. why? You trying to get rid of me?
no...no, it's just that, uh...
my mom might come, and she stays here...
here in the garage?
allergy thing.
so if you were gonna plan a trip to,
I don't know, Paris or Michigan.
I would need a heads-up.
OK.
well, the contractor guy I work for has got a spare room
no. No. No. Cause, cause you know, she might not come.
you know what?
your mom lives just over in Hamilton.
right. Right. Which is why she might not stay over.
so you should stay put.
you know, the doctors didn't tell me if my subtext decoder was damaged in that accident
but are you're trying to tell me something?
no.
Yes.
Yes. I just realized that
I have a washer and dryer inside.
and you could use them.
thank you.
Delia, I was an absolute idiot.
no, there's no need to coddle me, I was there.
I was an idiot.
I'm at Roger's house.
I just want to, I don't know, feel him out,
see if he ever suspected
Tammy of any kind of affair.
listen, you know what?
I'll talk to you soon, ok? bye.
excuse me.
do you know the kids who live in this house?
there's no kids there, just that lady and her husband.
Oh. Do you ever remember there ever being kids in this house?
Nope. Never. And we've lived here forever.
OK. Thanks.
this isn't a good time.
I'm about to be arrested.
det. Blair asked me to come down.
I guess she wants to read me my rights
Yeah. There are no kids.
where? - At Roger's house.
one of the neighborhood kids said they've never seen any kids.
wait. Tammy always talked about family,
I assumed...
Yeah, so did I. But it never dawned on me
that they may not be Roger's kids.
I mean, maybe she was married before.
so where's the family she's always been talking about?
that's what I was hoping you could ask Det. Blair.
I gotta go,
if you don't hear from me, bring bail.
have a seat.
I had nothing to do with it.
what?
I found another dead body,
you want to arrest me, admit it.
look, you're a talented profiler.
you help me solve cases.
I don't care how it works.
Oh. Ok.
so, uh, was it a suicide?
well, it looks that way.
the dental records confirmed the woman was a Tammy Gardner.
her husband's been informed.
what about her kids?
do you have any records of the children?
no.
says here the only family she had was a Roger Gardner.
he filed the missing person's report.
but Sarah Evers had 2 children.
who?
well, that's why I called you down here.
the dental records also matched a woman who's husband reported her missing 6 years ago
Sarah Evers.
wait. So, Tammy was also Sarah?
she had 2 identities?
maybe more. We don't know yet.
so, does the first husband know?
well, we're still trying to track him, see what his story is.
did Sarah's family live nearby?
thomas Evers filed the missing person's report from Lake Forest.
that's 3 counties over.
they don't know about their mom yet.
haven't had the heart to tell them.
I never thought it would end like this.
even after all these years,
I always thought she'd come back.
so, you said you were a friend of Sarah's?
when she lived in Grandview.
right.
I'll tell you what, when she left me,
I was blindsided.
I never saw it coming.
there were no signs of trouble?
no.
we were happy or so I thought.
apparently everyone knew what was really going on but me.
what do you mean?
after she left, the neighbors said they'd suspected something.
we had an electrician, did some work for us.
said things that made them think affair.
turns out, it was.
about a month later I get a postcard, saying she's never coming back.
that must've been devastating.
you have no idea.
especially for the boys...
7 and 10 at the time...
their mother abandoned them.
I wanted to grow old with her so bad.
what did I do?
you ready?
I left them for Roger.
Sam!
Hey, Sam!
Sam!
Sam, hi.
Oh, sorry.
I just, uh... I brought this stuff by for Mel.
it's just got some fixtures in it for the remodel.
great. Thanks.
sorry about the racket.
Oh, yeah. I understand.
you're just cranking it up when the landlady's away.
right. I know it's juvenile.
but it works perfectly when you're trying to take your mind of things.
you want some water? Fruit juice? Anything?
Yeah. Sure. Some water.
and what kind of things?
or is it something you don't want to talk about?
I'm sure Melinda's told you about this engagement ring.
Yeah. She mentioned it.
I really appreciate her concern.
but I feel weird talking to her about it.
because I know she's got a lot going on in her life.
I think that she just wants to make sure you're ok.
you know, I'm ok.
so are you thinking about going to look for her?
Yeah. But what do I say to her when I find her?
Hi, I was about I was going to propose marriage to you, but I've got a serious head injury.
but by the way, was it chicken or fish for the wedding?
Yeah. I suppose that would be kinda awkward.
I mean, I already broke my family's heart by not remembering them.
do I really need to add to the body count?
and besides, if this woman is the love of my life,
how come she hasn't found me?
I don't know why I kept all this stuff.
it's hard letting go.
I guess some part of me was hoping she was ok,
and that she'd want her things back one day.
how is Elizabeth dealing with the news?
well, it's been hard.
it's part of the reason I'm out here.
I figured it's time to put the past behind us, you know?
so if this is about the vase, you can go ahead and keep it.
no. actually it's not about that.
it's about Tammy.
I think it's time for her to move on as well.
what do you mean?
I have a gift. I see earthbound spirits.
and I've seen Tammy. she's confused.
she has no memory about what happened to her.
is this some kind of joke?
I know how it must sound.
ghosts that get stuck here like Tammy,
it's usually because of guilt.
I think hers has to do with the fact
that she left her husband and boys for you.
look, I don't know what you're after,
or how you even know that.
but taking Tammy from her boys is not something I'm proud of.
we fell in love. Passionately in love.
didn't mean to. Just happened.
but lots of people get divorced.
not so many flee in the middle of the night.
lots of people don't have husbands like Thomas.
what does that mean?
Tammy made him out to be pretty awful.
but now, you know, I'm not really sure about anything.
because she left you, too.
look. it doesn't matter anymore. she's dead.
I tried to help her find peace when she was alive.
I tried to give her a good life. But I couldn't.
I guess nobody could.
he's all torn up. he doesn't want anyone else to get hurt
so he's doing what men do best... avoiding it.
so he hasn't found her? or even started looking for her?
Nope.
well, at least that buys me some time.
although his fiancee could still show up at any minute.
Hey, by then Sam will have remembered that he's Jim.
and you will live happily ever after. right?
Hey. hand me that box. I'll take it out to the recycling bin.
I can see now... how I left my boys, my family.
but I can't remember why. what happened?
you're the only one who knows. try and think back.
you left Thomas, and then you left Roger, too.
I know you say that, but that couldn't have happened.
I'd never leave Roger.
please. why can't I remember?
what happened? Did someone do that to you?
sweetheart, you poor thing.
it's ok. I'm here now.
I don't know how that happened.
was it Thomas?
cause Roger said that he didn't treat you very well.
or was it Roger? or someone else?
no. Roger would never hurt me. He always took care of me.
OK. well, either way, it's something Roger knows about you.
maybe he talked to Elizabeth.
his new wife?
well, she had to have asked about you, about what happened.
you've been hanging around the old house.
is Elizabeth home right now?
no. she went out.
she's at the farmer's market.
Hi, I was at your house the other day.
Melinda, right?
sorry to bother you. I know this is a difficult time.
I'm sorry? what do you mean?
well, Roger must be upset about his first wife.
what are you talking about?
Tammy's dead.
they found her body yesterday.
how did... how did... what happened?
they're calling it a suicide.
but she had bruises on her wrists.
I think she was abused.
did she tell you that?
no, she just looked really scared.
like you do right now.
I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told her.
you're not alone.
there are people that can help.
I can help.
it's safe to talk to me.
I'm sorry. I have to get home. I can't be late.
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
you're starting to remember, aren't you?
I was just like her.
I was so scared. I was in such a dark place.
you were abused, of course you were in a dark place.
no. no.
I was in a really dark place.
Tammy?
I don't know how long I'd been in there.
it seemed like forever.
so, after you left your husband,
is that how Roger would punish you?
no.
that's where Roger kept me after he kidnapped me.
thomas was working late, and I was up doing the dishes.
I though Roger had gone home.
but suddenly he was... standing right behind me.
and he said that he knew that I wasn't happy.
and that he could make me happy.
was there something going on between you two?
No! I barely knew him.
he was... he was just some guy doing work on our house.
but the neighbors told your husband they suspected something.
I remember seeing him talking to them.
I just... I just thought he was just trying to round up more work.
so he wanted them to suspect something to cover his tracks.
what happened after he locked you up?
I lost count of the days.
I thought I was losing my mind.
I remember hearing my boys' voices.
I couldn't tell what was real anymore.
then one day, it all just changed.
Upsy-daisy. there we go.
Ooh, these are a little tight, huh?
suddenly he was so kind and caring.
it's ok.
at first it was just food.
and then it was bigger things.
like letting me go outside.
eventually he let me take trips to the market alone.
so you started to trust him.
Oh God, how could I have?!
you were brainwashed.
it happens. I don't know why.
it's called Stockholm syndrome.
did you ever try to get away?
no. no!
I couldn't.
he threatened that if I did, he would kill my family, my boys.
so the only escape was to kill yourself.
no, I wouldn't.
then what happened that day?
I was at the market.
for some reason I was late getting home.
Hey, honey.
I was worried about you.
sorry, I'm fine.
no, you're not fine.
what's going on, darling?
nothing, it's... nothing.
you know you can't lie to me.
did something happen in town you want to tell me about? Hmm?
no, I must've lost track of time.
after that he told me to go upstairs and rest...
that he would make me something to eat.
we ate.
then, I felt sleepy.
and I wanted to say something, but...
but the words wouldn't come out.
Roger always told me, "I decide when you leave.
I guess he decided it was time.
after he kidnapped and stockholmed her?
that's possible. Right?
I mean, I'm not making this stuff up?
no, what you're describing is exactly how it works.
he grabs her. He locks her up.
he threatens to kill her family if she runs.
she's scared out of her wits.
so what if he's doing the same thing to Elizabeth?
you said Elizabeth seemed scared, which is good,
that tells me she isn't completely brainwashed.
look, I want you to call Det. Blair and find out if anyone matching Elizabeth's description has gone up missing in the last year.
if she has a family anywhere, we need to get them somewhere safe.
and what're you gonna do?
just call me when it's done.
Elizabeth, are you here?
Roger spied on me sometimes.
I never knew when it would be.
so you're saying he could've seen me talking to Elizabeth at the market.
is someone there?
help.
help.
Oh, my God.
are you ok?
I'm so sorry.
stay away from her! Ahhh!
don't do this! I love you.
is that what you said to Tammy? is it?
before you killed her?!
she told you that?! she's insane!
she says she sees ghosts!
well, maybe she'll see yours soon!
that's enough!
get out of the way!
put it down, the police are on their way. Ok?
he's gonna get his punishment. Put it down.
punishment for what? having a wife?
who is gonna believe that I was held captive?
they'll say I could've run. He'll get away with it.
he thinks of everything.
then you have to think of everything... your family.
all right, if you kill him, you're gonna get put away.
and you'll be kept away from them forever.
think of your family. Put it down.
now you'll know what it feels like to be a prisoner.
no, no, please. Don't leave.
help me! Please! Elizabeth!
at least one of us got to go home.
thank you.
I can help you talk to your family.
you could say goodbye.
no, they think I abandoned them.
and I almost did.
how could they ever forgive me?
you didn't abandon them, not really.
there was always a piece of you that remembered.
I got your personal effects from the station.
I almost missed this, it was folded so many times.
that's my little boy.
that's Rich.
that's why I was late that night.
I stared at that picture for hours.
my heart just aching.
you must've put it in your wallet that day.
Roger knew that you were covering something.
he knew that he was losing control.
and he just couldn't let that happen.
let's go home.
do me a favor, get your brother a soda, ok?
Thanks.
so you're saying you talked with my wife's spirit.
that's why you came to me first.
that's, uh...
crazy. Yeah, I know.
um, Tammy...
Sarah, she needed some answers about things.
she couldn't remember what happened to her.
and now she does.
I'm so sorry, Thomas.
I wanted to grow old with you, too.
I wanted to see Joe hit his first grand slam,
and Rich get his braces off
and I wanted to buy that houseboat on the lake
and fill it with grandkids just like we talked about.
she says there's so much that she wanted to do with you,
the houseboat on the lake.
how did you know about that?
we had this joke.
we were gonna name the boat, 2 old coots.
2 old coots?
she's really here, isn't she?
Oh God, she must hate me.
I just left her there!
6 years and I never went after her.
I should've looked harder for her.
all she went through. I did nothing.
how can I forgive myself?
you have to. please tell him that.
Roger kept me prisoner for so long.
he used guilt, fear, remorse to keep me tied up.
don't let him do that to you, don't give him that victory.
I'm free now.
I want you to be, too.
she needs that to move on, to know that you're free, like she is.
I love you so much. You were our world.
I know. I felt that.
she knows that.
and you did helped her even if you didn't know it.
Hey, dad.
will you make sure that he tells them everything that happened?
that I always loved them?
I see something.
it's a light.
that's for you.
come here.
Thanks.
anything good in there?
Yeah. Huge story.
did you read about that guy who kidnapped those 2 women?
Yeah. Crazy, huh?
what a happy ending for the woman.
can you imagine what it was like for her to see her family again?
Yeah. Thank God the police got there in time.
she gets a real second chance.
kinda like me.
I just can't keep carrying this thing around.
I mean, I might have somebody worrying about me.
just like these women did.
and if you find that person, what then?
I don't know...
you move between the world of life and death.
you don't know the price.
what price?
No! please, not you!
you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.
you're back!
do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see,
different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.
he's in there somewhere.
he just has to be.
you're not gonna tell me that you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
because your are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
it's not much. But maybe you could help me finish my garage.
and you could live there while you do the work.
just until you figure out your next move.
that's strange. I've been hoping for a clue.
something to tell me who I was.
I bought that less than a month ago.
question is, who did I buy it for?
Oh, my god. It's true. You don't know who I am, do you?
you must be Nicole.
the fiancee? -She is not his fiancee until he puts a ring on her finger.
OK. So where are they now?
I don't know. He hasn't been home all day.
but he's with her? Nikki.
I assume so.
how much time are they actually spending together?
well, he's not working, and she's in town. so...
you didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.
what about the nights? Is she still staying at the hotel?
Yes.
but they're spending all day together.
I'm really trying not to think about it.
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her
so that he could explain to her what happened and then say goodbye.
well, guess what. They're saying hello.
I think I hear them.
no. No. No. They're just gonna see you.
Oh, yeah. That's a lot better.
did she see me?
can I?
no. - Hold on a second, Sam.
uh, Melinda?
this is nuts. Hi. I am Delia.
Hi, Delia. I'm Nikki. I was looking for Melinda.
found it! - Oh, gosh!
Nikki, Delia. Have you met Delia?
Yes. We did.
I found it. - Oh, great.
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.
no. It's great.
Hey, Melinda.
Hi, Sam.
uh, Nikki left her cell phone here. So...
right. So...
I guess I'll be taking you back...
well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.
it's fine and everything.
but I'm actually going to be spending a little bit more time than I originally planned.
and I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.
but I was only able to get a week off from work.
and I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.
so, you are here. And just if you didn't mind?
mind?
just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.
obviously.
no. No.
because we're really just getting to know each other.
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Really? It's ok. I can stay with you?
sure.
great. - Great.
great.
we were walking around the house into the back.
and we get there.
and her grandmother and grandfather are there.
Oh, my god!
what are you doing?
swimming.
are you crazy? What are you thinking?
Paula, come on, it's freezing! - No way!
she's going in.
no. - Catch me if you can!
Paula, don't go out there.
Oh, my God! This is no！
is she serious? -I'm not going in there, no way!
Paula, come back!
mark, do something.
Paula, come on! Wait!
Paula, come on! It's freezing.
seriously, come on!
Paula, come on, it's freezing.
where is she?
mark, look down.
fish, oh, gross. - Oh, sick.
Paula, come back, ok?
very funny, we get it. Just come back, seriously.
come on.
come on, guys. The water's great.
come on, Paula. - All right, let's go.
Paula, come back.
Yeah, Paula. It's not funny. Seriously.
what was that?
Oh, my god. I think there's...
Oh, my god!
Hey, it's ok. You're ok now.
just get me out of here.
OK, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?
getting your mind off the fact that your husband's dating your roomie.
she is not my roomie. Ok?
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.
you're literally the girl that can't say no.
should've made you very popular in high school.
Hey! I can say "no."
then what are you doing up here with me?
you said you needed a favor.
and I need a favor, too. Ok?
just please keep working with Sam...
no matter what it takes to get his memory back... before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.
just please help us.
of course. I'll do whatever I can.
but now my favor.
EW. Do you smell that?
dead fish everywhere.
a biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.
but I thought you might get results faster.
me?
a student of mine was up here swimming with some friends last night.
the whole experience freaked her out.
and not just the dead fish.
she said something was pulling her under.
she called it a presence.
look, I know it's a long shot, but her father died earlier this year...
what was his name?
he's here.
but do you hear that?
he's not alone.
tell no one.
you're sure that's the ghost you saw?
I think so. He responded to his name, anyway.
according to his obituary, he was 52.
died of a stroke.
well, that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.
how they looked at the moment of their death, or how they looked in life.
half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.
it says here he died at the hospital.
what was he even doing at the lake?
sometimes spirits gather. I've seen it before.
but it's usually around the place of their death.
so this is where they all died?
you'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.
do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?
Yeah. But that was almost 20 miles away.
so what are they doing there?
keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one.
not a lot of subtext there.
unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.
it's the biologist I told you about from the university.
he found heavy concentrations of a particular pathogen in the water.
the same pathogen found in the waters filled with bodies after hurricane Katrina.
so they're actually in there?
we'll know soon enough.
health department's gonna dredge the lake.
Oh! That's my appointment with Sam.
well, go! Go. Get out of here.
what?
no, but I want it back. Give it back!
you gave it to me.
I did not give it to you.
give it.
well, here look. If you want it so badly.
well, I just wanted to show you the article.
you always do this.
Hey, Eli.
this is Nikki.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
OK. Buddy. Take care.
well, listen. Thank you so much for helping us out.
Oh, sure. Um...
is this going to be a joint session?
no, it's just me. But we were running so late,
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...
it's fine. Don't worry about it. Not a problem.
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.
thank you.
past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.
with all due respect,
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life
is going to help me find this one.
all right. The one that I lost.
it loosens the subconscious.
my subconscious?
do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?
it is telling me that something off.
good, that's good. Keep going.
well, Nikki for example. Ok?
she's beautiful. She's smart. She's blonde?
blonde? You're into blondes?
no. That she has nice hair.
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.
I mean, I remember how it smelled.
well, then why can't I remember at all jerking her around for 10 years?
maybe you just didn't want to marry her.
OK. So I was Mr. Can't Commit.
that's what everyone says.
you know what I think? I think I remember wanting to get married.
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...
tell me about her.
well, that we wanted to have kids.
I mean, maybe we were even trying.
if that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?
by she you mean...?
Nikki. Who else?
you tell me.
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.
I want you to consider that maybe... just maybe...
there's someone else.
wait, someone more important than the woman I spent half my adult life with?
look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.
look, I... I really gotta talk to her.
but thanks. This has been a big help.
did they find anything?
Yeah. Plenty.
a reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.
victims? Is that what they are?
Paula's father died in a hospital.
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.
maybe the paper got it wrong.
anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.
I don't hear anything.
they're here.
so how'd it go with Sam? - So- so.
as his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.
what I almost told him.
which was?
that he's Jim, your husband.
and anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.
so he remembered something?
just that he wanted to have kids.
well, that's huge!
he thinks he wants to have them with her.
what am I going to do?
you've disturbed us. All of us.
all we asked for was your silence.
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.
it's the health department and the police.
they want answers.
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.
they deserve to find out what happened to you.
just tell us how we can help.
what is it that you want...
to protect the living.
from what?
got another one.
what if they just all died of the same thing?
some chemical, toxic-something?
in the lake?
I think the C. D.C. would say that the dead people are the problem.
and bothers me is not how they got there, but why they stayed.
your Latte, and the cappuccino. - Thanks.
well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?
Yeah. That's the upside.
that's an upside?
you know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured there by someone or something.
what do you mean? Like some kinda ghost cult?
no. More like the ghosts in the tunnels, you know, or the watchers.
the watchers?
a group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.
they said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.
Ahh. There's Sam.
and no Nikki. And he's heading toward the store.
go. Go be with him.
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.
go!
all right. Ok.
Hey, Melinda. That's funny.
I was just coming to see you.
do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?
no. I'm good. - Great.
thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.
Oh, yeah. It's no problem.
I didn't even see her last night.
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.
and she was asleep when I left. So.
Yeah. She's a night person.
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.
I guess both of us were.
she'd do crosswords. I would read the sports pages.
we'd stay up... I hate crosswords.
I don't even remember.
although, you know it's funny.
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average...
wait. How do you know that?
you hear something enough times it kinda sticks.
look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,
how is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia
but I don't remember something that Nikki and I fought about for years?
in my head, I remember wanting to have kids.
and Nikki didn't?
no, she says she did.
so this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.
and she's gotta be right.
I mean, she sounds right.
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.
not all guys are like that.
my husband wasn't.
I was always the one dragging my heels.
but Jim, he...
he wanted everything that you're remembering...
which has to mean something, right?
what to me and Nikki?
no, to you.
it's none of my business.
but maybe you... maybe you shouldn't listen to what everyone else says, not about the stuff that really matters.
you know who you are.
when you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...
to what? To being the guy like your husband?
committed, confident enough in himself,
in the world, to bring another human being into it?
but you see, I wasn't.
so pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.
thank you so much for coming.
of course, you seemed upset.
I don't understand.
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,
and then the next thing I know I get a call from the health department recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.
and then I turn on the TV and see them pulling dead bodies out of water that I was just swimming in.
I know this must be scary...
it's disgusting.
I wish I could make you feel better.
but unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.
what are you talking about?
I need to ask you about your father.
first I need you to consider the possibility that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.
Why?
because I've talked to your father's ghost.
he was up at the lake.
he's there...
no, this is... this is crazy.
Paula, you said you felt a presence,
you think my dad is one of the corpses They're pulling out of that water?
look, I know this is hard to accept...
no, literally. There's no way.
Why?
he's right here.
your father was cremated... where?
is this what you wanted? To be cremated?
I was done with my body.
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.
and now they have to feel your loss all over again.
protect the living.
you meant, from what happened to you.
we were betrayed.
look what's become of us.
it's just how you see yourselves.
no. It's how they'll see us too.
my wife, my daughter.
they'll be forced to...
no. No. You can talk to them.
you can help them through this.
and they'll remember you just as you were.
and then you can move on.
we're not going anywhere.
we've waited.
there's business to finish.
what is it that you want to finish?
you mean who.
if they went to the movies they should been back by now.
or if they went to dinner...
I don't know where they are.
and I don't want to know.
well, you should want to know
when your competition looks like this.
it's tough love, girlfriend. And you gotta hear this.
OK. So what do you want me to do?
get into the game!
you gotta fight fire with fire!
look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini and mud wrestle for the guy.
well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.
does it look like I'm doing nothing?
no, it looks like you're helping another ghost.
not just one ghost, a lot of them.
OK, and they left loved ones behind.
and if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.
I'm not so sure Sam can.
Yeah. Neither am I.
then why don't you do something about it?
because nothing...
nothing I can do will get him to remember me...
or choose me.
all I can do is have faith.
that's all I have right now.
faith.
it's so nice to meet you.
Carl gets so few visitors lately.
not that we're surprised in his business.
who wants to watch someone dying?
when did he close the funeral home?
when the cancer made it impossible for him to work.
did he take care of your family?
no. He... helped some friends of mine.
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.
he doesn't listen to me anymore.
get through to him?
he has so little time, and he's in such pain...
but he won't take the pills they give him.
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.
but really, why go on like this?
do you want me to talk to him?
thank you.
come on.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I don't know you.
what do you want?
I came to talk about the lake.
what lake?
where the bodies are.
where you put them. Didn't you?
part of me hoped I would die before this day.
and the other part?
what if they're waiting for me?
why did you do it?
I thought I had no choice.
what do you mean?
the big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.
but my great grandfather built that place from nothing.
and I was proud.
and I wanted a better price.
what happened?
what always happens.
they undercut me. I couldn't compete. The money ran out.
and when the furnace finally broke down,
I was desperate.
it's no excuse.
sometimes I think...
the cancer is a punishment.
all this pain.
your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.
I feel evil.
Carl, you made a mistake. You're not evil.
no. No. I feel evil around me.
everywhere.
you're right. Carl, they're here.
all the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.
Oh, no.
I see them.
Oh, please.
they're angry because of what you did. But I can help.
please just give me the names of all the people that you threw into the lake.
I can talk to their families. I can help them heal.
to help them suffer, you mean.
then they'll drop their anger, ok?
not until he's suffered like we have.
you need to go into the light.
there's forgiveness there.
Carl, take your medicine.
I went back and looked where he told me to.
back to the funeral home?
wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.
yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.
formaldehyde girl, that's funny.
sorry. Not funny.
did you get the list of names?
Yeah. I'm just trying to see if their I. D. s match what we found.
Hey, here's Paula's dad.
was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?
cremation, cremation.
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...
cremated. I'll call you back.
how are you?
I'm fine.
um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?
sure. What about him?
well, first of all, I want to apologize for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.
but I really... honestly, I didn't know who else to go to.
you know how you grow up imagining what it'll be like to be in love?
you picture your boyfriend, your husband.
and not just the good times...
but the fights and the problems, too.
Yeah. Sure.
could you ever have imagined something like this happening?
a guy that you loved just wakes up one day and then suddenly has no idea who you are?
no. Never.
Really? Not at all?
I... I don't understand.
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...
do you think it's a little odd that he's staying in your garage?
the same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?
and where are the plans? I haven't seen any of those.
what are you driving at?
when I first came here, my idea was a quick in and out.
let Sam know that he was forgiven, maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.
but now that I've seen who he is, this new Sam who wants kids, who's ready to settle down.
I... I don't want to let him go.
what does that have to do with me?
that's what I'm trying to find out.
shouldn't you be asking Sam?
you're not gonna make this easy, are you?
I thought I just did.
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.
I apologize for coming by without calling.
I thought you'd want to know.
Carl died, a few hours ago.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what you said, but after you left, he seemed to change.
he relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.
after a few hours later, he took my hand.
then his eyes opened wide, like he saw something amazing.
and that was it.
that look in his eyes, he must have just seen the face of his maker.
don't you think?
that's a lovely notion.
thank you so much, Melinda, for giving my husband peace.
how did I get here?
Oh, no! No. Melinda!
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.
for you, there's nowhere but here.
forgive me.
please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you for forgiveness.
please! Please!
that's not what you'll find here.
help me!
tell me, how can I help you?
mom, you wanted to talk about this.
no one is mad at you, Mom.
speak for yourself.
when Edwin had his stroke, he was jogging a few miles from home.
he had no wallet, no ID.
so the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.
I went.
but I couldn't do it.
I just...I couldn't look at him.
Paula was there by then, so she did it.
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.
mom, I didn't mind doing it.
there was no shame in what happened to him.
why couldn't I just look at him?
marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.
most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.
my daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.
he is stuck here? He can't move on?
that's right.
he and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,
they're earthbound, which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.
why not?
they don't want you to know what happened to them.
out of shame.
that's why your husband tried to scare Paula away that night at the lake.
can we help them?
you might.
but right now, they're very angry.
until the right moment comes...
if Edwin's ghost is still here, then that means he saw what I did when he died.
please give me the chance to make it right.
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!
sorry.
I'm sorry. The door was open.
look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.
and, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.
I'm fine.
are you sure? Because you seemed a little tense, and frankly, so did Nikki.
no, really. I'm fine.
OK.
well, then I'll go back to the hotel.
Why?
I mean, she's been here almost a week, so what are you going to do?
I don't know. It's weird.
I feel things when I'm with her.
nice things.
her smell is familiar.
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.
you know, it's comfortable.
OK.
Melinda, not everybody can have what you had with your husband. All right?
and given my track record, I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.
of course you are.
maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
and, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance, you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.
maybe that's a good thing.
maybe I should reach out with both hands.
all right.
don't.
don't what?
you can do better for yourself than "comfortable
or "maybe getting some feelings back."
hold out for more.
what?
what am I holding out for?
everything.
hold out for everything.
you know, that's easy for you to say.
you had everything.
who's there?
Carl, why are you here?
you said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.
did you look into the light?
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.
why not?
because of my shame.
but you apologized.
I mean, you tried to make things right.
you can come out of the shadows now.
no, I can't. They're looking for me.
they want me to go with them.
those spirits are angry because of what you did.
nobody can keep you from the light.
it's not them. It's the others.
the others? - Spirits I've never seen before.
but they said they know you.
they know me?
they said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,
and something you cherished was lost.
And?
they said you believed in things that weren't right,
and trusting those things might hurt others...
and you.
Hello?
I'm here.
what do you want from me?
what did I do to offend you?
you did nothing.
then why did you take my husband away?
fate did that, not us.
you came to me and you said That death would touch something that I loved.
and before I knew it, he was dead.
we just warned you to be careful.
Yeah. 'cause that's what you were doing was warning me
with all your lies and threats.
we don't lie or make threats.
you told Carl that he couldn't cross over.
the light has never denied anyone.
the light doesn't make the choice.
we each do.
we? You mean you.
no, each of us for ourselves.
you wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.
well, it's the same reason that Carl did.
when the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.
so Carl's shame kept him here.
when spirits feel unworthy, sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.
to make ourselves worthy.
what spirits stay back to do that?
I haven't seen any.
you're meeting four of them now.
you?
why do you think we're still here?
so when Carl said that you asked him to join you... ?
they explained it to me, and I understand now.
this is what I want.
are you sure?
because they said it's your choice.
you can move on now.
I want to be one of them.
all right.
will you help me fix the wrongs I did?
how?
by taking away their shame.
thank you all for coming tonight.
we'd asked for family and friends,
and I just never realized how many friends we have.
Hey, Eli. - Hi, Sam.
I wasn't sure what to say,
so I asked my darling English major Paula for some help.
and she wrote down some thoughts for me.
Paula? Don't be shy.
tonight we send our loved ones "to where we thought they'd already gone.
it seems like a detour, "an embarrassing wrong turn.
but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.
we pretended we did, and that made us feel better.
but every path leads to the unknown.
some paths join others, and some split off on their own.
we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.
maybe the more we insist on knowing, "the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns.
I know what you're thinking, "that the unknown is scary.
but that's ok.
we're human.
maybe before we feel free, "we're supposed to feel fearful.
maybe it means more that way.
so let's all say goodbye now.
and remember, that no matter what we're feeling, "there's no shame.
no shame at all.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Nikki's downstairs.
she wanted to talk to you first.
first?
heh, I... I don't know why you've been so nice to me.
letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...
it's not easy to say this,
we have our whole lives ahead of us.
and whatever you're feeling right now,
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.
someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.
you don't have to...
the weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.
he's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.
he talks about holding out.
and that's sort of amazing, because everything I've been holding out for,
he is ready to give.
and I don't know why, but I feel like I have to thank you for that.
no hard feelings, I hope.
you... you deserve every happiness.
thank you.
thank you.
thanks for coming.
please, uh...
just be happy.
Bye.
Bye.
please, not you!
you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
you're back!
do i know you?
look, i see the same guy that you see.
different hair, noses, eyes, it's not jim.
he's in there somewhere, he just has to be.
you're not going to tell me you think i'm your husband reincarnated.
because you're the only sane person i've met since i woke up.
it's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage, and you could live there while you do the work, just until you figure out your next move.
Oh, my god, it's true. You don't know who i am, do you?
you must be nicole.
the fiance? -she is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.
Bye.
Bye.
you mean, nikki really left?
just like that?
I still can't believe it.
and so after she drove away, then what happened?
well, it was...
intense.
we just stood there, staring at each other.
that really happens?
I'm telling you, it was like everything around us just dropped away, you know?
as if there was some kind of...
magnetic field drawing us together as though...
nothing could stop what was about to happen.
Delia and eli: so? What happened?
Jim and melinda: i called you.
Really?
please.
well, i didn't know what else to do.
then you really do need therapy.
it's just all been so crazy, you know?
starting with the first day when i woke up in that hospital, and there she was.
I still don't know what you're waiting for!
there is nothing standing in your way.
Yeah, nothing, except that he doesn't remember he's jim.
and he might not, mel.
but you know that's jim's spirit in there, and you know you want to be with him.
you're right, it's just starting fresh with this new jim, it's so weird! I mean, i barely know this girl, and then on the other hand, i feel like i've known her forever.
I mean, i was married to this man.
you know? We lived a lot of life together.
I have these really strong feelings about her!
so now i'm just supposed to start falling in love with a man that i've already been in love with for years?
how does that even work?
where do we start?
a school dance?
I mean, that's, uh...
Yeah, i know. I know.
it's just, i promised delia that i would chaperone tonight.
but they're raising money to fight against hunger, so...
well, actually, i was going to say that in a way, it's kinda perfect.
it is?
I mean, sure. It's, um...
I mean, what better way to get over the awkward first date jitters than in a crowd of awkward teenagers?
here we are, ladies.
careful.
judging by the dance floor, i think these are spiked.
I am as open-minded as the next person, but who calls that dancing?
I mean, this is a public place for god sake!
mom! You're making me look bad!
please don't tell me these are friends of yours!
no, and they never will be, if you keep this up.
come on.
come on!
Oh, youth.
when did we become the old fogies?
what do you mean?
I don't think so.
guys, free drinks.
shall we? Come on. -we shall.
all right. I gotta get my vibe on here.
ready?
Oh, come on! Don't be a buzz kill.
no, i'm done.
I guess this is the part where we find out if i have, uh, 2 left feet.
is this ok?
Yeah, it's good.
Jeff, stop it, you're being gross.
Jeff, stop it, don't!
that is enough!
get the hell away from her!
I told you he was coming, creep.
come on. Let's go.
Hey, are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, i'm good. Yeah, i'll be right back.
excuse me. -sorry.
those kids that just left, do you know them?
I've never seen him before.
the girl's kristy marks.
we were in eighth grade orchestra together.
anyone around her die lately?
sure can pick 'em.
her mom. I heard it was some kind of freak accident in their house.
don't tell me-- she's here?
I'm not sure yet.
-It's jammed!
what are you doing?
that's hot.
Oh, my god!
are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, i'm fine. Come on, let's go.
come on i said stay away from her!
there you are.
I was wondering where you were.
that looks like trouble.
Yeah.
well, i know that delia appreciated us being there, even if it wasn't a perfect first date.
I thought it was romantic.
Really? -yeah.
I saw 2 break-ups, 3 hook-ups, and then one kid get sick on his date's very nice shoes.
and all in the short time that i was looking for you.
I'm sorry again for being so distracted. I...
don't be.
you were worried about those kids.
you care about people.
what's not to like?
you have to stop him.
was something there?
no, it's just i'm off the clock, so later!
OK, later...
no, i mean-- we are done with our-- our chaperone duties, so why don't we have a glass of wine later?
which actually means right now.
OK.
that sounds good.
does it?
sure.
you're the only one who can see me.
please, help.
uh, you know what, it's late, and we both have to work tomorrow, so maybe we should do this another time.
all right. That's fine, too.
please, stop them!
I had a great time, and i really thank you for going.
Yeah.
so...
Bye.
night.
OK.
what do you want? And you know what, it had better be important!
you're kristy's mom, aren't you?
Yes.
you have to keep that boy away from her.
which boy?
Tim. The one she drove off with.
but it looked like he was trying to help her.
no. He's bad.
she has no idea who he is.
OK, well, you have to tell her. I'll help you.
she won't listen to me, she never has.
you need to stop this.
you're in early, what's up?
did something happen after the dance?
Nope. Nothing.
Oh, bummer. Why not?
someone's mom showed up.
what, sam's mom's back?
no, not sam's. A ghost mom.
she was at the dance last night keeping tabs on her daughter kristy.
Oh, she didn't like the way we chaperoned?
apparently not.
her daughter left with a college guy after drinking some spiked punch.
I rounded up all the kids who were drinking, i called their parents.
don't worry, she had a designated driver.
the problem was, ghost mom didn't approve of him and thinks he's bad news.
so any idea who these people are?
Ned knew the girl. Kristy from orchestra.
but that's all i know.
there we go.
it's definitely my ghost.
she died a month ago, an accident at the home.
that is some power couple.
Yeah, she was a civil litigation lawyer.
her husband's a judge.
she just got nominated for a seat on the appeals court.
that's weird.
the ghost's hair was singed, and i keep getting visions of ashes and burning.
but it doesn't say anything about a fire.
or about the boy she's trying to keep her daughter away from.
so do you want me to ask ned to scope the girl out at school tomorrow?
Thanks, but my love life can't wait that long, if i still have one.
Hi.
I'm really sorry to bother you, but i was a chaperone at last night's dance, and i was hoping i could talk to you about your daughter.
I had a feeling the school would be sending someone.
come in, please. -thank you.
if this is about the drinking, she told me the whole story.
her boyfriend, or rather ex-boyfriend, spiked her punched.
Yeah, we figured that part out.
I'm not saying she's not culpable.
no one made her drink.
but i hesitate to be too severe right now.
her mother passed away recently.
I heard.
was it sudden?
just one of those freak things.
she took a bad fall.
was there fire involved?
no. Why do you ask?
just something that kristy said.
well, might have been the punch talking.
I'm just glad jeff's mom drove her home.
actually, a friend picked her up.
an older boy, he was in a green car.
that would be tim dwight.
I appreciate your telling me. Kristy knows i don't want her seeing him.
Oh, well, actually, i think that he was saving her from a bad situation.
I understand.
but tim is not a good guy.
though you are not the first one he's fooled.
Deborah, my late wife, was a gifted lawyer, but her passion was for helping troubled kids, giving them a second chance.
tim was one of those.
he'd been in bradford county juvie for robbery till 8 months ago.
she arranged a work probation as one of her assistants.
I guess she thought he had some kind of future.
and you disagreed?
look, most of the kids that deborah took in were basically good, they just needed a break.
but not tim.
he came from a family that cared about him.
he was given every opportunity, but it didn't matter.
he took advantage of every kindness my wife extended him.
we'd all have been better off if they'd never come into our lives.
I know that now.
are you ok?
Yes. I'm sorry, i was just...
thinking about how hard this must be on kristy.
was she or anyone in the house when your wife's accident happened?
no. Deborah wasn't even supposed to be here.
she was meeting me at a charity event.
right, i think i read something about that, where someone walked in on the break-in.
no, that's not what happened.
there was no break-in at all.
in fact, when i got home from the event, the alarm was on, the doors were all locked, nothing had been disturbed.
so, you think this bad boy tim could have killed your ghost?
no, i don't know if she was killed, but in the vision i had, it looked like she walked in on a robbery.
OK, so she must have tripped trying to run, or she was knocked over, hit her head on the andiron.
Yeah, but when the husband came home, there was no sign of a break-in.
no, he said the alarm was on, the doors were locked, and it was obviously shocking to find her there.
Yeah, well, this tim worked for her.
he probably had the keys, the code, and maybe even the safe combination.
he could have cleaned up and locked after himself.
husband never even suspected foul play.
dang, i always wanted to say that.
you know, the ghost said that kristy didn't even know who tim was.
so maybe she was saying he was a murderer, but if that's the case, why wouldn't she just tell me?
maybe she didn't know for sure, didn't get a good look at him.
or she wants to punish him herself.
no way.
if a mom knew that her daughter was hanging around with a murderer, she would tell everybody that she could and then she would punish him.
I know. So i'm stumped.
how are we supposed to help a ghost that won't come clean?
Kristy, right?
yeah...
Oh, hey, you used to be in orchestra.
right? -yeah.
Hey, i just want to tell you, i'm really sorry about your mom.
Thanks, but i'm coping.
Hey, i saw you at the dance the other night.
Oh, yeah, if i did something stupid, i don't want to know.
ha, hello, my mom busted the guy that spiked the punch.
nothing tops out on the embarrassing scale.
uh, how about that creep was my date?
wait, so who's the guy that picked you up?
Tim. We're just friends.
he used to work for my mom, which is why we were just friends.
she didn't approve.
caused plenty of fights before she died.
he seemed cool. Why didn't your mom like him?
no, at first she did. He hung out at our house all the time.
he was like a work study kid.
Yeah, she got him a clerkship, a scholarship.
so what happened?
I got kind of a crush on him.
douglas: thank you.
they just won this big class action suit at my mom's firm, and we were celebrating.
it was always fun when tim was over.
sorry about my parents.
it's ok, it was fun.
when he was leaving, i couldn't help it.
tim wasn't even into me.
he said he only thought i was into him to get to my mom, i mean, which i did.
I can see your mom's point.
he was older.
Yeah, she gave me plenty of reasons.
but you thought it was something else.
look, i feel bad talking like this now that she's gone, but if he was such bad news, why did she keep paying for his school, his tutoring, his trips home?
she was in love with him.
OK, not what i expected.
Yeah, i mean, i gotta say, the whole cougar thing is a little outside my kick zone.
well, if that's true, then it explains why the ghost is being so secretive.
Thanks.
Eli, hey, it's melinda.
listen, i'm trying to dig up information on tim, but i can't find anything online.
Eli: it's because juvie records are sealed.
reporters can't even mention them by name.
well, then i gotta talk to him. Can you get an address for me?
why the rush? He's still in town, right?
I gotta go. I'll call you back.
glad to see you.
thanks for stopping by.
um, can we...
look, i don't know, but i've just been thinking about the other night, and-- what were you thinking?
did i make you uncomfortable?
no.
no, not at all.
it just seems that you were a little skittish, and i won't take it personally.
I just-- i don't want you to feel pressured.
not at all. Ok?
not even a little bit, ok?
there are no second thoughts here.
good.
cause i just saw on the marquee that it's fright night week at the little theater.
you want to go?
wait a minute. You like scary movies?
I'd really like to find out.
and i'd especially like to find out with you.
I'd like that, too.
all right, how about tomorrow?
Yes!
that was a little too enthusiastic.
Nah.
it was just about the reaction i was hoping for.
6: 00 seem ok?
Yeah, 6:00 is-- is perfect, ok?
and, um, and i'm going to be working, so you can just come and get me here.
Bye, delia.
Bye.
Bye.
where is she always running off to?
Oh, you'll learn not to take it personally. Ok?
Hi, um, i'm melinda gordon, i'm a friend of the marks.
is there something wrong?
no, i was a chaperone the other night at the dance, and i saw you leave with kristy.
all right, look, she called me, ok?
she was buzzed. That creep was all over her.
I just wanted to get her home safe, that's it.
Yeah, i know.
that's what it looked like, like you were just helping her out of a jam.
so what?
did kristy's dad send you to check that story out?
no.
actually, i'm not here for him.
um, i'm trying to help the family deal with their loss, and so i was hoping i could talk to you about mrs. Marks.
well, look, she's gone now, so really, what is there to talk about?
well, i know you two were close.
Kristy said that you spent a lot of time together.
Mrs. Marks was good to me.
she gave me a second chance when i needed one, that's it.
I don't know what you're trying to get at.
well, i'm just trying to help.
you know, that's exactly what your friend mrs. Marks said when she bailed me out of juvie.
and it didn't take me long to realize that there's no such thing as charity.
everyone wants something.
OK, but you just said that she was good to you.
so which is it?
he's been a real downer lately.
did i overhear you say you were friends with mrs. Marks?
are you tim's roommate?
I am.
boy, he was sulking around the house after that.
Really? He was upset?
cause he just seemed pretty mad.
I never really understood his thing with her.
what, like a romantic thing?
well, the way tim talked, mrs. Marks was his mentor.
but then one day, her husband dropped by unexpectedly looking for tim, but he was on a business trip with mrs. Marks.
and mr. Marks had no idea?
not the way he reacted. He was pretty upset.
you said you would keep him away from my girl.
you didn't keep your promise.
because i need to understand why this is so important to you.
did you and tim have an affair?
is that what all this ash is about?
embers of your love?
stop it.
I asked you to do one thing.
one thing!
did your husband find out?
was he there the night that you died?
I'm trying to help you!
I don't want your kind of help.
stay away from my family, you understand?
stay away.
so watching your only daughter hook up with your young lover once you're dead.
I don't think that this is about jealously.
it's about a mom protecting her daughter from something bad.
what aren't you putting in there?
pickles.
cabinet.
nice.
OK, i say we have a whodunit countdown on a scale from one to five, whose prints are on that safe?
starting with the husband.
OK, maybe three is a better bet.
why do we need a vote?
why can't we just have it checked out?
because mr. Marks will never allow it.
well, then maybe that tells us something, too.
no.
like i told you before, there was no robbery.
now what is this about?
I have a gift.
I can see ghosts, and...
the other day, your wife's spirit was with me.
that's ridiculous.
she gave me a vision about what happened the night that she died, and it looked like she had walked in on a robbery.
which is odd, considering you said there wasn't one.
I think it's time for you both to leave.
the safe behind that picture frame, it had been rummaged.
and she was either hit or tripped or fell somewhere over there.
that information wasn't in any of the newspapers.
sometimes spirits stay earth-bound.
it's usually for a reason.
I think that she's protecting someone-- tim, kristy, or...
maybe even you.
and what would she have to protect me from?
she didn't tell me, but i think it's something that she was ashamed of.
Melinda spoke with tim's roommate.
he said you'd been there looking for tim before your wife died.
he was worried that you thought maybe they had had an affair.
OK, this is none of your business.
unless you have some reason for wanting my wife's memory tarnished.
actually, we think it's your sterling reputation your wife is trying to keep untarnished.
you keep saying there wasn't a fire, but i see ashes; something burning.
was there anything missing from the safe, anything at all that could have been burned?
I haven't had the heart to open it since she died.
I've been afraid of what i might find.
like evidence of an affair?
none of it matters now.
I loved my wife, and if tim had something to do with her death, then yes, i want to know about it.
but it's none of your concern, so if you'll please excuse me...
so the burning paper in your vision, any idea what it was?
it was charred, but i could make out that it was a woman's handwriting, so...
see? Can i call it or what!
a love letter. It's gotta be.
the ghost could have been burning it.
tim walked in, they fought, and kabonk!
or tim could have been burning it when mrs. Marks walked in.
or mr. Marks burned it.
well, any way you slice it, the paper was burned.
so someone wanted whatever was on it to be kept a secret.
Yeah, and the ghost still does.
Ooh, i'll get it.
maybe sam is early.
what's wrong?
how could you do this?
do what?
the cops just took tim in for questioning about some supposed robbery at my house!
my dad had the safe fingerprinted because of what you said!
well, if his fingerprints were there-- -of course they were there!
he was my mom's assistant!
look, kristy, i know that you're upset, but maybe your feelings for tim are clouding your judgment.
he's innocent!
he was with me, we were at the bookstore.
did you tell your dad that?
my dad thinks that i'm just lying to protect tim, and he won't even look at me.
like i would protect my own mom's murderer, that's insane!
look, you know that he has a history and a criminal record, and maybe it's possible that he isn't who you think he is.
I know that he would not hurt anyone.
and if you do talk to ghosts like my dad said, why don't you just ask my mom?
because i don't think she'd talk to me.
she's mad because i didn't keep you and tim apart.
sometimes i just hate her.
this isn't what i wanted.
then what do you want?
please, just tell me what happened, because you're the only one who can fix this.
I really wish i could.
but some secrets are better left alone.
Eli: i got nothin'.
Tim's still being questioned.
detective blair couldn't tell me anything yet.
well, did they find anything missing from the safe?
what part of "i got nothin'" didn't you get?
all right. Sorry, i thought you could pull some weight in there.
no, but apparently judge marks does.
they're looking at this as a possible murder case.
my guess is, tim's going to be in there for a while.
Oh, i hope i did the right thing by having them check that safe.
don't be such a softie.
you told me yourself you had a vision of mrs. Marks walking in on a break-in.
Tim's prints are all over that safe, ok?
he seems pretty guilty to me.
Yeah, but-- -and please don't tell me you're having second thoughts because deborah never actually said she saw tim do it.
we both know she just saying what she did.
OK, still-- -and i don't want to hear pleas that kristy said she swears he was with her.
she's no more reliable than her mother.
Except--- -don't tell me you're falling for tim, too.
No! All right?
I'm just trying to think out loud, which would be easier without so many interruptions.
sorry.
the ghost said that kristy doesn't know who tim is, so couldn't that have something to do with his record?
I mean, maybe that's what she burned.
the police report, or-- -which we can't access.
Yeah, but we could talk to somebody who knew him, his mom only lives like an hour away-- crap!
my date with sam!
I almost forgot.
I knew you didn't wear that for me.
I can't cancel, ok?
can you handle this?
I'd love to, but starting at 3: 00, i got back-to-back cases.
fine. You know what, if i rush, i'll make it back in time.
I only found out my son was in trouble again when i called his apartment.
tim didn't want me to be upset, i guess.
you're a friend of mrs. Marks?
she thought a lot of your son. That's why i'm here.
she was a wonderful person, really believed in tim.
he's a good boy.
there's no way he had anything to do with her death.
but he was arrested before for robbery.
he was innocent then, too.
Tim's girlfriend's older brother did it.
so why did tim take the blame?
the girl came to him crying, said that her brother broke into an electronics store.
tim went to stop him, only the cops showed up.
he knew the older boy had 2 strikes, so he said he did it.
do you mind if look at some of his things?
it might help. -you can scour the whole house if you like.
I just want my boy's name cleared.
that's tim and his brother george.
older?
Mmm, by about 8 years.
tim was an unexpected blessing.
the little prince.
that was tim's first book.
Melinda: there's a page missing.
do you know what happened?
God knows.
it's a wonder this thing has any pages left at all.
tim just loved that story.
it came home from the hospital with him.
well, that's sweet.
usually it's blankets and booties.
I'm afraid they wouldn't have fit our timmy.
he was almost 6 months old when we brought him home.
Why? Was something wrong?
no, it was just the agency protocol.
tim was adopted.
I ruined everything.
it's ok.
you don't have to keep secrets anymore.
I know why you care so much about tim, and i know why you don't want him to be with your daughter.
he's her brother, isn't he?
Yes.
Tim's my son.
it was the hardest thing i ever did, letting him go.
and then when i found him again, it was like a gift.
tell me what happened.
Ddouglas and i fell in love when he was in law school.
I was an undergraduate.
not long after that, i found out that i was pregnant.
and he didn't want children yet?
it wasn't his.
it was somebody i dated before him.
so i told doug that i was taking a year abroad, and i went home to have the baby.
I tried to keep him, but i was 18, barely older than kristy.
in the end, i had to do what was best for my baby.
and you never told douglas?
I tried to put it behind me, but it haunted me.
I looked for tim in the face of every boy his age.
and finally i hired a private detective.
and he found tim in jail.
I couldn't stand seeing my boy in that place.
I had to get him out.
so why didn't you tell your family?
or his?
I thought maybe there was a way i could help him without stirring things up.
and then kristy fell for tim.
seems like that would have been a good time to say something.
and i would have if it weren't for douglas' appointment to the bench.
so i figured i would just keep tim and kristy apart until he was confirmed, and then i'd tell everyone.
so the business trip, with tim, that was really just to spend time with your child?
Yes.
and then a week later, i lost the chance of ever telling him the truth.
I'd stopped by the house to get my cell phone.
I couldn't help but think it was tim.
maybe he was getting back at me about kristy.
and then i saw that the note i wrote him when he was a baby was gone.
I panicked.
Kristy was always going on about how i was in love with tim.
I mean, maybe he thought that it was a love letter.
so i cleaned up.
I couldn't let anyone know that tim was there.
I felt so responsible for the break-in, for everything.
I brought it all on myself.
and that's when i saw it.
I don't blame him for burning it.
it was the missing page from his book, wasn't it?
it was a closed adoption.
a personal note wasn't permitted.
so you ripped out the page, and you gave him the book.
I wanted him to have something from me.
and i kept the note all that time because it was a piece of him.
Deborah, i-- i don't think tim thought it was a love letter.
I think he knew exactly what it was, and that's why he's been so upset.
he wasn't mad, he-- he was mourning you.
but if tim knew that he was my son, why wouldn't he tell kristy?
unless...
he thinks he's protecting her.
his sister.
maybe that's it.
at some point, you broke into that safe, and either you or tim burnt a note that you found inside of it.
just tell me why you were in the safe that night.
because...
I couldn't look at my own mom anymore.
it was sick. She falls for somebody that i like, and then makes it seem like i did something wrong.
and my dad wouldn't listen.
it was like i didn't exist.
and i needed out.
so why was tim here?
to try and stop me.
Kristy, you don't want to do this.
no, i really do.
what is all this stuff?
where is it?
where does she keep her cash?
one of these things has got to have money in it!
Oh, my god, someone's coming!
come on, let's go!
then we ran out the back door.
I swear, we had no idea what had happened. Tim didn't break in?
it was kristy?
why didn't you say anynything when they brought tim in today?
I was afraid that if i said he was here, it would make things worse for him.
but i knew that he did not hurt my mom, because he was with me the whole night.
I did that, too-- tried to hide the truth to protect my family.
but the lies hurt more than anything.
Kristy, your mom's here.
and what tim found out that night, she wants you to know, too.
he was her son.
she'd put him up for adoption when he was a baby.
he's...
my brother?
what's going on?
daddy...
your wife is here.
and there's something she needs to tell you.
I could never understand, why me?
I mean, there were plenty of other kids in juvie, ones that could have used the break.
but why'd she pick me?
I knew it wasn't because of what kristy said.
I mean, it just wasn't like that.
and then you found the note?
I must have read that book a thousand times.
don't ask me why.
and i always wondered what happened to that page.
but why hide it?
why hide it from her family that i was her son, from her family?
I could only think that it was because she was ashamed of me.
Oh, god, that's not true.
I cherished you.
she wasn't ashamed of you.
she cherished you.
she wants you to know how sorry she is.
I just didn't know what your family would do, or mine.
I'd broken all kinds of closed adoption rules in contacting you.
she was scared.
about what would happen to your family, and hers.
but she's here.
I was always so scared.
since the moment you were born, looking at your-- your face.
I loved you so much, and it terrified me.
I was scared that-- that i couldn't take care of you, or that your new family wouldn't be good to you, or when i found you again, i was scared of who you'd be.
I just wanted so badly to do good; to do what was right.
but it all went wrong.
she was scared that she wouldn't be able to give you what you needed.
she really wanted to do what was best for you, and she's afraid she didn't.
no, no, no, no, no.
that's not true.
you tell her she did the best she could.
she's listening.
she did so much right.
you gave me a great life, and a wonderful family that loves me.
and when i needed help, when i got in trouble, you gave me a second chance.
and i'm not gonna take that for granted.
I'm gonna make you proud of me, i promise.
Oh, sweetheart.
I already am.
she said she already is proud of you.
there's one more thing.
in that note that you left for me, i only remember the first part...
my tim, my little prince, all the places you'll go...
the worlds you'll see.
my love is always with you, wrapped around you like a prince's cape, my sweet, sweet boy.
she's ready.
she's not scared anymore.
thank you.
Jim's voice: hey, this is sam lucas.
please leave me a message after the beep.
Yeah, hi.
um, it's me.
I hope that, uh, well, i hope that you're getting all of my messages.
um, i'm still hoping for that-- that rain check, you know, the one that i've mentioned now, well, a million times, actually.
um, ok.
could you-- could you just-- call me back?
come in.
Hi.
I'm sorry i flaked.
I was just wondering about that rain check.
what do you mean?
didn't you get my messages?
no, not yet.
I saw that you called.
Oh.
so you just didn't pick up.
no.
it was 7: 00 and i was standing on the sidewalk in front of a dark store.
I'd been there for about an hour.
as adorable and cockamamie as your excuse surely is, i didn't pick up.
look, i know what it's about.
what? What is it about?
that you're not ready to start dating yet, and it makes total sense.
I understand, and there's no hard feelings.
no, but i am ready!
your head says you are...
but your heart says no, not yet.
no, it doesn't!
OK, my heart doesn't say that.
I think i would know what my heart says.
Melinda, i get it. It's ok. You don't have to do what about the rain check?
I'm free right now, how about you?
Yeah.
you're gonna freeze. Here, take this.
Oh, thank you.
please, not you!
you have to cross over. - I don't want to.
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.
you're back!
do I know you?
look, I see the same guy that you see...
different hair, noses, eyes,
it's not Jim.
he's in there somewhere. He just has to be.
you're not going to tell me you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
because you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
it's not much, but maybe you could help me finish my garage,
and you could live there while you do the work,
just until you figure out your next move.
Oh, my god, it's true. You don't know who I am, do you?
you must be Nicole.
the fiancée?
she is not his fiancée until he puts a ring on her finger.
Bye.
Bye.
you mean, Nikki really left? Just like that?
Yeah. I still can't believe it.
and so after she drove away, then what happened?
well, it was...
intense.
we just stood there, staring at each other.
that really happens?
I'm telling you,
it was like everything around us just dropped away,
you know? As if there was some kind of...
magnetic field drawing us together
as though...
nothing could stop what was about to happen.
so?! what happened?
I called you.
Really? Please.
well, I didn't know what else to do.
then you really do need therapy.
it's just all been so crazy, you know?
starting with the first day when I woke up in that hospital, and there she was.
I still don't know what you're waiting for!
there is nothing standing in your way.
Yeah, nothing, except that he doesn't remember he's Jim.
and he might not, Mel.
but you know that's Jim's spirit in there, and you know you want to be with him.
you're right, it's just starting fresh with this new Jim,
it's so weird!
I mean, I barely know this girl,
and then on the other hand,
I feel like I've known her forever.
I mean, I was married to this man.
you know? We lived a lot of life together.
I have these really strong feelings about her!
so now I'm just supposed to start falling in love with a man that I've already been in love with for years?
how does that even work?
where do we start?
a school dance?
I mean, that's, uh...
Yeah, I know. I know. It's just,
I promised Delia that I would chaperone tonight.
but they're raising money to fight against hunger, so...
well, actually, I was going to say that in a way, it's kinda perfect.
Oh. It is? - Yeah.
I mean, sure.
it's, um...
I mean, what better way to get over the awkward first date jitters than in a crowd of awkward teenagers?
here we are, ladies.
careful.
judging by the dance floor,
I think these are spiked.
I am as open-minded as the next person, but who calls that dancing?!
I mean, this is a public place for god sake!
mom! You're making me look bad!
please don't tell me these are friends of yours!
no, and they never will be, if you keep this up.
come on.
come on!
Oh, youth.
Oh! When did we become the old fogies?
what do you mean?
I don't think so.
guys, free drinks.
shall we?
come on. We shall.
all right. I gotta get my vibe on here.
ready?
Oh, come on! Don't be a buzz kill.
no, I'm done.
I guess this is the part where we find out if I have, uh, 2 left feet.
is this ok?
Yeah, it's good.
Jeff, stop it, you're being gross.
Jeff, stop it, don't!
that is enough!
get the hell away from her!
I told you he was coming, creep.
come on. Let's go.
Hey, are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, be right back.
OK.
sorry. - Excuse me.
those kids that just left, do you know them?
I've never seen him before.
the girl's Kristy Marks.
we were in eighth grade orchestra together.
anyone around her die lately?
sure can pick 'em.
her mom.
I heard it was some kind of freak accident in their house.
don't tell me... she's here?
I'm not sure yet.
what's wrong with it.
it's jammed!
what are you doing?
that's hot.
Oh, my god!
are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
come on, let's go.
I said stay away from her!
there you are.
I was wondering where you were.
that looks like trouble. - Yeah.
well, I know that Delia appreciated us being there,
even if it wasn't a perfect first date.
I thought it was romantic.
Really? - Yeah.
I saw 2 break-ups, 3 hook-ups,
and then one kid get sick
on his date's very nice shoes.
and all in the short time that I was looking for you.
I'm sorry again for being so distracted.
I... - Don't be.
you were worried about those kids.
you care about people.
what's not to like?
you have to stop him.
was something there?
no, it's just I'm off the clock, so later!
OK, later...
no, I mean... we are done with our... our chaperone duties,
so why don't we have a glass of wine later?
which actually means right now.
OK. That sounds good.
does it?
sure. - Ok.
you're the only one who can see me.
please, help.
uh, you know what,
it's late, and we both have to work tomorrow,
so maybe we should do this another time.
all right.
that's fine, too.
please, stop them!
I had a great time,
and I really thank you for going.
so...
Bye.
night.
OK.
what do you want?
and you know what, it better be important!
you're Kristy's mom, aren't you?
Yes.
you have to keep that boy away from her.
which boy? - Tim.
the one she drove off with.
but it looked like he was trying to help her.
no. He's bad.
she has no idea who he is.
OK, well, you have to tell her. I'll help you.
she won't listen to me, she never has.
you need to stop this.
Hey. you're in early, what's up?
did something happen after the dance?
Nope. Nothing.
Oh, bummer. Why not?
someone's mom showed up.
what, Sam's mom's back?
no, not Sam's.
a ghost mom. She was at the dance.
last night keeping tabs on her daughter Kristy.
Oh, she didn't like the way we chaperoned?
apparently not. Her daughter left with a college guy after drinking some spiked punch.
I rounded up all the kids who were drinking,
I called their parents.
don't worry, she had a designated driver.
the problem was, ghost mom didn't approve of him
and thinks he's bad news.
so any idea who these people are?
Ned knew the girl. Kristy from orchestra.
but that's all I know.
there we go.
it's definitely my ghost.
deborah Marks. She died a month ago,
an accident at the home.
Wow. That is some power couple.
Yeah, she was a civil litigation lawyer.
her husband's a judge. He just got nominated for a seat on the appeals court.
that's weird.
the ghost's hair was singed,
and I keep getting visions of ashes and burning.
but it doesn't say anything about a fire.
or about the boy she's trying to keep her daughter away from.
so do you want me to ask Ned to scope the girl out at school tomorrow?
Thanks, but my love life can't wait that long,
if I still have one.
Hi.
I'm really sorry to bother you,
but I was a chaperone at last night's dance,
and I was hoping I could talk to you about your daughter.
I had a feeling the school would be sending someone.
come in, please. - Thank you.
if this is about the drinking,
she told me the whole story.
her boyfriend, or rather ex-boyfriend,
spiked her punched.
Jeff. Yeah, we figured that part out.
I'm not saying she's not culpable.
no one made her drink.
but I hesitate to be too severe right now.
her mother passed away recently.
I heard.
was it sudden?
just one of those freak things.
she took a bad fall.
was there fire involved?
no. Why do you ask?
just something that Kristy said.
well, might have been the punch talking.
I'm just glad Jeff's mom drove her home.
actually, a friend picked her up.
an older boy, he was in a green car.
that would be Tim Dwight.
I appreciate your telling me.
Kristy knows I don't want her seeing him.
Oh, well, actually, I think that he was saving her from a bad situation.
I understand.
but Tim is not a good guy.
though you are not the first one he's fooled.
Deborah,
my late wife, was a gifted lawyer,
but her passion was for helping troubled kids, giving them a second chance.
tim was one of those.
he'd been in Bradford County Juvie for robbery till 8 months ago.
she arranged a work probation as one of her assistants.
I guess she thought he had some kind of future.
and you disagreed?
look, most of the kids that Deborah took in were basically good, they just needed a break.
but not Tim.
he came from a family that cared about him.
he was given every opportunity, but it didn't matter.
he took advantage of every kindness my wife extended him.
we'd all have been better off if they'd never come into our lives.
I know that now.
are you ok?
Yes. I'm sorry, I was just...
thinking about how hard this must be on Kristy.
was she or anyone in the house when your wife's accident happened?
no. Deborah wasn't even supposed to be here.
she was meeting me at a charity event.
right, I think I read something about that,
where someone walked in on the break-in.
no, that's not what happened.
there was no break-in at all.
in fact, when I got home from the event, the alarm was on, the doors were all locked,
nothing had been disturbed.
it was just a tragic accident.
so, you think this bad boy Tim could have killed your ghost?
no, I don't know if she was killed, but in the vision I had,
it looked like she walked in on a robbery.
and she definitely heard something in the house.
yum, anchovies.
OK, so she must have tripped trying to run, or she was knocked over, hit her head on the andiron.
Yeah, but when the husband came home,
there was no sign of a break-in.
no, he said the alarm was on, the doors were locked, and it was obviously shocking to find her there.
Yeah, well, this Tim worked for her.
he probably had the keys, the code, and maybe even the safe combination.
he could have cleaned up and locked after himself.
husband never even suspected foul play.
dang, I always wanted to say that.
you know, the ghost said that Kristy didn't even know who Tim was.
so maybe she was saying he was a murderer,
but if that's the case, why wouldn't she just tell me?
maybe she didn't know for sure,
didn't get a good look at him.
or she wants to punish him herself.
no way.
if a mom knew that her daughter was hanging around with a murderer,
she would tell everybody that she could and then she would punish him.
I know. So I'm stumped.
how are we supposed to help a ghost that won't come clean?
Kristy, right?
yeah...
Oh, hey, you used to be in orchestra.
Ned.
right? - Yeah.
Hey, I just want to tell you,
I'm really sorry about your mom.
Thanks, but I'm coping.
Hey, I saw you at the dance the other night.
Oh, yeah, if I did something stupid,
I don't want to know.
ha, hello, my mom busted the guy that spiked the punch.
nothing tops out on the embarrassing scale.
uh, how about that creep was my date?
wait, so who's the guy that picked you up?
Tim. We're just friends.
he used to work for my mom,
which is why we were just friends.
she didn't approve.
caused plenty of fights before she died.
he seemed cool. Why didn't your mom like him?
no, at first she did.
he hung out at our house all the time.
he was like a work study kid.
Yeah, she got him a clerkship,
a scholarship.
so what happened?
I got kind of a crush on him.
thank you.
they just won this big class action suit at my mom's firm,
and we were celebrating.
it was always fun when Tim was over.
sorry about my parents.
it's ok, it was fun.
when he was leaving, I couldn't help it.
tim wasn't even into me.
he said he only thought I was into him to get to my mom, which I did.
I can see your mom's point.
he was older.
Yeah, she gave me plenty of reasons.
but you thought it was something else.
look, I feel bad talking like this now that she's gone,
but if he was such bad news,
why did she keep paying for his school,
his tutoring, his trips home?
she was in love with him.
OK, not what I expected.
Yeah, I mean, I gotta say,
the whole cougar thing is a little outside my kick zone.
well, if that's true,
then it explains why the ghost is being so secretive.
Thanks.
Hello?
Eli, hey, it's Melinda.
listen, I'm trying to dig up information on Tim,
but I can't find anything online.
it's because juvie records are sealed.
reporters can't even mention them by name.
well, then I gotta talk to him.
can you get an address for me?
why the rush? He's still in town, right?
I gotta go. I'll call you back.
Hi! Glad to see you.
thanks for stopping by.
um, can we...
look, I don't know,
but I've just been thinking about the other night,
and... what were you thinking?
did I make you uncomfortable?
no.
no, not at all.
it just seems that you were a little skittish,
and I won't take it personally. I just...
I don't want you to feel pressured.
not at all. ok? not even a little bit,
OK?
there are no second thoughts here.
good. 'cause I just saw on the marquee.
that it's fright night week at the little theater.
you want to go? - Wait a minute.
you like scary movies?
I'd really like to find out.
and I'd especially like to find out with you.
I'd like that, too.
all right, how about tomorrow?
Yes!
that was a little too enthusiastic.
Nah.
it was just about the reaction I was hoping for.
6: 00 seem ok?
Yeah, 6:00 is...
is perfect, ok?
and, um, and I'm going to be working, - So you can just come and get me here. - Ok.
Bye, Delia.
Bye. - Bye.
where is she always running off to?
Oh, you'll learn not to take it personally.
Tim?
Hi, um, I'm Melinda Gordon, I'm a friend of the Marks.
is there something wrong?
no, I was a chaperone the other night at the dance,
and I saw you leave with Kristy.
all right, look, she called me, ok?
she was buzzed. that creep was all over her.
I just wanted to get her home safe, that's it.
Yeah, I know. That's what it looked like,
like you were just helping her out of a jam.
so what?
did Kristy's dad send you to check that story out?
no. Actually, I'm not here for him.
um, I'm trying to help the family deal with their loss,
and so I was hoping I could talk to you about Mrs. Marks.
well, look, she's gone now,
so really, what is there to talk about?
well, I know you two were close.
Kristy said that you spent a lot of time together.
Mrs. Marks was good to me.
she gave me a second chance when I needed one, that's it.
I don't know what you're trying to get at.
well, I'm just trying to help.
you know, that's exactly what your friend Mrs. Marks said when she bailed me out of juvie.
and it didn't take me long to realize
that there's no such thing as charity.
everyone wants something.
OK, but you just said that she was good to you.
so which is it?
he's been a real downer lately.
did I overhear you say you were friends with Mrs. Marks?
are you Tim's roommate?
I am. Boy, he was sulking around the house after that.
Really? He was upset?
cause he just seemed pretty mad.
I never really understood his thing with her.
what, like a romantic thing?
well, the way Tim talked, Mrs. Marks was his mentor.
but then one day, her husband dropped by unexpectedly looking for Tim,
but he was on a business trip with Mrs. Marks.
and Mr. Marks had no idea?
not the way he reacted. He was pretty upset.
you said you would keep him away from my girl.
you didn't keep your promise.
because I need to understand why this is so important to you.
did you and Tim have an affair?
is that what all this ash is about?
embers of your love?
stop it. I asked you to do one thing. One thing!
did your husband find out?
was he there the night that you died?
I'm trying to help you!
I don't want your kind of help.
stay away from my family, you understand?
stay away.
so that's motive enough.
except if he did it, why was the safe broken into?
he was looking for evidence of an affair, you know?
our ghost, his wife, came in, catches him, they fight.
you get the picture, right?
now she's protecting him out of guilt, you know?
and lest we forget, he's a judge.
so I doubt the cops looked at this death.
or his alibi very closely.
Yeah, but if hubby killed her,
why is the ghost set on keeping Tim and Kristy apart?
Hello! Do you blame her?
I mean, it must be so painful watching your only daughter hook up with your young lover once you're dead.
I don't think that this is about jealously.
it's about a mom protecting her daughter from something bad.
what aren't you putting in there?
pickles.
cabinet. - Nice.
OK, I say we have a whodunit countdown
on a scale from one to five, whose prints are on that safe?
starting with the husband.
OK, maybe three is a better bet.
why do we need a vote?
why can't we just have it checked out?
because Mr. Marks will never allow it.
well, then maybe that tells us something, too.
no.
like I told you before,
there was no robbery.
now what is this about?
I have a gift.
I can see ghosts,
and...
the other day, your wife's spirit was with me.
that's ridiculous.
she gave me a vision about what happened the night that she died,
and it looked like she had walked in on a robbery.
which is odd, considering you said there wasn't one.
I think it's time for you both to leave.
the safe behind that picture frame,
it had been rummaged.
and she was either hit or tripped or fell
somewhere over there.
that information wasn't in any of the newspapers.
sometimes spirits stay earth-bound.
it's usually for a reason.
I think that she's protecting someone...
Tim, Kristy, or... maybe even you.
and what would she have to protect me from?
she didn't tell me, but I think it's something that she was ashamed of.
Melinda spoke with Tim's roommate.
he said you'd been there looking for Tim before your wife died.
he was worried that you thought maybe they had had an affair.
OK, this is none of your business.
unless you have some reason for wanting my wife's memory tarnished.
actually, we think it's your sterling reputation your wife is trying to keep untarnished.
you keep saying there wasn't a fire, but I see ashes; something burning.
was there anything missing from the safe, anything at all that could have been burned?
I haven't had the heart to open it since she died.
I've been afraid of what I might find.
like evidence of an affair?
none of it matters now.
I loved my wife, and if Tim had something to do with her death, then yes, I want to know about it.
but it's none of your concern, so if you'll please excuse me...
so the burning paper in your vision, any idea what it was?
it was charred, but I could make out that it was a woman's handwriting, so...
see? Can I call it or what!
a love letter. It's gotta be.
the ghost could have been burning it.
tim walked in, they fought, and kabonk!
or Tim could have been burning it when Mrs. Marks walked in.
or Mr. Marks burned it.
well, any way you slice it, the paper was burned.
so someone wanted whatever was on it to be kept a secret.
Yeah, and the ghost still does.
I'll get it.
maybe Sam's early.
Kristy!
what's wrong?
how could you do this?
do what?
the cops just took Tim in for questioning about some supposed robbery at my house!
my dad had the safe fingerprinted because of what you said!
well, if his fingerprints were there...
of course they were there!
he was my mom's assistant!
look, Kristy, I know that you're upset,
but maybe your feelings for Tim are clouding your judgment.
he's innocent! He was with me,
we were at the bookstore.
did you tell your dad that? -Yeah.
my dad thinks that I'm just lying to protect Tim,
and he won't even look at me.
like I would protect my own mom's murderer, that's insane!
look, you know that he has a history and a criminal record, and maybe it's possible that he isn't who you think he is.
I know that he would not hurt anyone.
and if you do talk to ghosts like my dad said, why don't you just ask my mom?
because I don't think she'd talk to me.
she's mad because I didn't keep you and Tim apart.
sometimes I just hate her.
this isn't what I wanted.
then what do you want?
please, just tell me what happened,
because you're the only one who can fix this.
I really wish I could.
but some secrets are better left alone.
I got nothin'. Tim's still being questioned.
detective Blair couldn't tell me anything yet.
well, did they find anything missing from the safe?
what part of "I got nothin" didn't you get?
all right. Sorry, I thought you could pull some weight in there.
no, but apparently judge Marks does.
they're looking at this as a possible murder case.
my guess is, Tim's going to be in there for a while.
Oh, I hope I did the right thing by having them check that safe.
don't be such a softie.
you told me yourself you had a vision of Mrs. Marks walking in on a break-in.
Tim's prints are all over that safe,
OK? He seems pretty guilty to me.
Yeah, but...
and please don't tell me you're having second thoughts because Deborah never actually said she saw Tim do it.
we both know she just saying what she did.
OK, still... - And I don't want to hear please that Kristy said she swears he was with her.
she's no more reliable than her mother.
except. -Don't tell me you're falling for Tim, too.
No! all right? I'm just trying to think out loud, which would be easier without so many interruptions.
sorry.
the ghost said that Kristy doesn't know who Tim is,
so couldn't that have something to do with his record?
I mean, maybe that's what she burned.
the police report, or... -Which we can't access.
Yeah, but we could talk to somebody who knew him, his mom only lives like an hour away...
crap!
my date with Sam! I almost forgot.
I knew you didn't wear that for me.
I can't cancel, ok? Can you handle this?
I'd love to, but starting at 3: 00,
I got back-to-back cases.
fine. You know what, if I rush, I'll make it back in time.
I only found out my son was in trouble again when I called his apartment.
tim didn't want me to be upset, I guess.
you're a friend of Mrs. Marks?
Yes. She thought a lot of your son.
that's why I'm here.
Yeah.
she was a wonderful person, really believed in Tim.
he's a good boy.
there's no way he had anything to do with her death.
but he was arrested before for robbery.
he was innocent then, too.
Tim's girlfriend's older brother did it.
so why did Tim take the blame?
the girl came to him crying, said that her brother broke into an electronics store.
tim went to stop him, only the cops showed up.
he knew the older boy had 2 strikes,
so he said he did it.
do you mind if look at some of his things?
it might help.
you can scour the whole house if you like.
I just want my boy's name cleared.
that's Tim and his brother George.
older?
Mmm, by about 8 years.
tim was an unexpected blessing.
the Little Prince.
that was Tim's first book.
there's a page missing.
do you know what happened?
God knows.
it's a wonder this thing has any pages left at all.
tim just loved that story.
it came home from the hospital with him.
well, that's sweet.
usually it's blankets and booties.
I'm afraid they wouldn't have fit our Timmy.
he was almost 6 months old when we brought him home.
Why? Was something wrong?
no, it was just the agency protocol.
tim was adopted.
I ruined everything.
it's ok.
you don't have to keep secrets anymore.
I know why you care so much about Tim,
and I know why you don't want him to be with your daughter.
he's her brother, isn't he?
Yes.
Tim's my son.
it was the hardest thing I ever did,
letting him go.
and then when I found him again, it was like a gift.
tell me what happened.
Douglas and I fell in love when he was in law school.
I was an undergraduate.
not long after that, I found out that I was pregnant.
and he didn't want children yet?
it wasn't his.
it was somebody I dated before him.
so I told Doug that I was taking a year abroad,
and I went home to have the baby.
I tried to keep him, but I was 18,
barely older than Kristy.
in the end, I had to do what was best for my baby.
and you never told Douglas?
I tried to put it behind me,
but it haunted me.
I looked for Tim in the face of every boy his age.
and finally I hired a private detective.
and he found Tim in jail.
I couldn't stand seeing my boy in that place.
I had to get him out.
so why didn't you tell your family?
or his?
I thought maybe there was a way I could help him
without stirring things up.
and then Kristy fell for Tim.
seems like that would have been a good time to say something.
and I would have if it weren't for Douglas' appointment to the bench.
so I figured I would just keep Tim and Kristy apart
until he was confirmed,
and then I'd tell everyone.
so the business trip, with Tim, that was really just to spend time with your child?
Yes.
and then a week later,
I lost the chance of ever telling him the truth.
I'd stopped by the house to get my cell phone.
I couldn't help but think it was Tim.
maybe he was getting back at me about Kristy.
and then I saw that the note I wrote him when he was a baby was gone.
I panicked.
Kristy was always going on about how I was in love with Tim.
I mean, maybe he thought that it was a love letter.
so I cleaned up.
I couldn't let anyone know that Tim was there.
I felt so responsible for the break-in,
for everything.
I brought it all on myself.
and that's when I saw it.
I don't blame him for burning it.
it was the missing page from his book, wasn't it?
it was a closed adoption.
a personal note wasn't permitted.
so you ripped out the page, and you gave him the book.
I wanted him to have something from me.
and I kept the note all that time because it was a piece of him.
Deborah, I...
I don't think Tim thought it was a love letter.
I think he knew exactly what it was,
and that's why he's been so upset.
he wasn't mad, he...
he was mourning you.
but if Tim knew that he was my son,
why wouldn't he tell Kristy?
unless...
he thinks he's protecting her.
his sister.
maybe that's it.
at some point, you broke into that safe,
and either you or Tim burnt a note that you found inside of it.
just tell me
why you were in the safe that night.
because...
I couldn't look at my own mom anymore.
it was sick. She falls for somebody that I like,
and then makes it seem like I did something wrong.
and my dad wouldn't listen.
it was like I didn't exist.
and I needed out.
so why was Tim here?
to try and stop me.
Kristy, you don't want to do this.
no, I really do.
what is all this stuff? Where is it?
where does she keep her cash?!
one of these things has got to have money in it!
Oh, my god, someone's coming!
come on, let's go!
then we ran out the back door.
I swear, we had no idea what had happened
tim didn't break in?
it was Kristy?
why didn't you say anything when they brought Tim in today?
I was afraid that if I said he was here,
it would make things worse for him.
but I knew that he did not hurt my mom,
because he was with me the whole night.
I did that, too... tried to hide the truth
to protect my family.
but the lies hurt more than anything.
Kristy, your mom's here.
and what Tim found out that night, she wants you to know, too.
he was her son.
she'd put him up for adoption when he was a baby.
He's...my brother?
what's going on?
daddy...
your wife is here.
and there's something she needs to tell you.
I could never understand, why me?
I mean, there were plenty of other kids in juvie,
ones that could have used the break.
but why'd she pick me?
I knew it wasn't because of what Kristy said.
I mean, it just wasn't like that.
and then you found the note?
I must have read that book a thousand times.
don't ask me why.
and I always wondered what happened to that page.
but why hide it?
why hide it from her family
that I was her son, from her family?
I could only think that it was because she was ashamed of me.
Oh, god, that's not true.
I cherished you.
she wasn't ashamed of you.
she cherished you.
she wants you to know how sorry she is.
I just didn't know what your family would do, or mine.
I'd broken all kinds of closed adoption rules in contacting you.
she was scared.
about what would happen to your family, and hers.
but she's here.
I was always so scared.
since the moment you were born,
looking at your... your face.
I loved you so much, and it terrified me.
I was scared that...
that I couldn't take care of you,
or that your new family wouldn't be good to you,
or when I found you again, I was scared of who you'd be.
I just wanted so badly to do good;
to do what was right.
but it all went wrong.
she was scared
that she wouldn't be able to give you what you needed.
she really wanted to do what was best for you,
and she's afraid she didn't.
no, no, no, no, no.
that's not true.
you tell her she did the best she could.
she's listening.
she did so much right.
you gave me a great life,
and a wonderful family that loves me.
and when I needed help, when I got in trouble,
you gave me a second chance.
and I'm not gonna take that for granted.
I'm gonna make you proud of me, I promise.
Oh, sweetheart.
I already am.
she said she already is proud of you.
there's one more thing.
in that note that you left for me,
I only remember the first part...
my Tim, my little prince,
all the places you'll go...
all the worlds you will see.
my love is always with you.
I wrap you in it, "like a prince's cape,
my sweet, sweet boy.
the worlds you'll see.
my love is always with you,
wrapped around you like a prince's cape,
my sweet, sweet boy.
she's ready.
she's not scared anymore.
thank you.
Hey, this is Sam Lucas.
please leave me a message after the beep.
Yeah, hi. Um, it's me.
um, Melinda.
I hope that, uh,
well, I hope that you're getting all of my messages.
um, I'm still hoping for that... that rain check,
you know, the one that I've mentioned now,
well, a million times, actually.
um, ok.
could you... could you just...
call me back?
come in.
I'm sorry I flaked.
I was just wondering about that rain check.
what do you mean?
didn't you get my messages?
no, not yet.
I saw that you called.
so you just didn't pick up.
no.
it was 7: 00
and I was standing on the sidewalk in front of a dark store.
I'd been there for about an hour.
as adorable and cockamamie as your excuse surely is,
I didn't pick up.
look, I know what it's about.
what? what is it about?
that you're not ready to start dating yet,
and it makes total sense.
I understand,
and there's no hard feelings.
no, but I am ready!
your head says you are...
but your heart says no, not yet.
no, it doesn't!
OK, my heart doesn't say that.
I think I would know what my heart says.
Melinda, I get it. It's ok. You don't have to do...
OK.
what about the rain check?
I'm free right now, how about you?
Yeah.
I'm ready. - Me, too.
you're gonna freeze. Here, take this.
Oh, thank you.
the day of the accident,
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body
you're back!
do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see.
it's not Jim.
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes,
and Jim is in there somewhere.
that's Dr. Byrd. He's dangerous. Look into the light.
I'll be staying right here, where you live.
I see ghosts.
all right, if this is supposed to be funny, it's not.
if you stop trying, then you're never going to get back what you lost.
your memories, they're not yours.
who am I? - Jim!
I'm not your husband.
you decided you couldn't accept that your husband is dead,
and so you filled my head with his memories.
I think you should just get your things and leave.
Melinda... - Good-bye.
Hi, it's Melinda.
talk at the beep.
Melinda, hi.
I'm probably the last person you want to hear from right now,
but I kind of...
well, besides wanting to hear your voice,
I need to ask you a favor.
I think I left something in your garage
and I didn't want to just come by, because...
I don't know if you even want to see me.
so if you could... give me a call,
that'd be...
Thanks.
is that him again?
you know, Sam says that I have to face the facts,
and he's right.
he's not Jim, and he never will be.
Hey! Don't say that.
you know, if he were,
he would have believed me when I told him the truth.
but instead, he just kept saying "I need more proof, I need more time.
and when I gave him everything,
even evidence, it was right there in his own head,
he still couldn't.
look, you may never be able to understand this
because you've never actually had a choice,
but when you're asked to let go of everything you've ever believed in, that's not easy.
and you're asking him to let go of himself,
the only self he's ever known.
I'm not asking him anymore,
because I'm done.
Mel!
you can't give up.
you love him, right? And he loves you.
he may not be the exact man...
I don't think I love him anymore.
what?
what do you mean? It's Jim!
in a way.
Yeah, I guess.
but the Jim that I love,
he had something Sam never will,
and I don't know if it's something I can live without.
what?
faith.
in me.
where are you going?
to the store.
you know, there's some things I can do before tomorrow.
you're going to the store at this hour?
Yeah. It's better than going home.
who are you? How did you get in here?
I don't know.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
I'm calling the police!
the police are on their way!
Dr. Byrd!
what are you doing? Who was that?
there's more where he came from.
how safe do you feel now?
will you two relax?
OK, I wasn't in any danger.
some random guy breaks into the store
and you weren't in any danger?
OK, he didn't break in,
he came in through the tunnels.
and he was led there by that Dr. Byrd guy.
how can you be so sure?
because he was confused.
he didn't know where he was.
and if Byrd led him there,
then he was probably doing that persuasive whispering thing.
you gotta seal up that entrance.
with concrete and steel.
and throw a little led in there. And garlic.
I don't know, whatever else keeps the evil spirits away.
I can't.
there's just too many lost souls still in there.
Yeah, but this was a man.
a real, living person.
what did he want?
and more important, what does Byrd want?
he's ticked!
you crossed his favorite mental patient into the light.
you poached his client.
did he threaten you?
byrd said that there was more where he came from,
and did I feel safe now.
see, in danger.
what is that supposed to mean? - I don't know.
but I do have to find out who this Ben guy is.
Ben?
what, did you exchange business cards?
no, he was wearing a Grandview water and power jumpsuit
with the name "Ben" on it.
well, that was very handy.
actually, it is, because it will make it easier for Eli to find him
no, wait, what? Me?
look, we have to find out why Byrd brought this guy here.
he was one of your colleagues.
colleague? The guy's dead.
fine, but he still thinks that he's practicing psychiatry for some reason.
Yeah, but you're not suggesting I meet with Dr. Byrd.
you're suggesting I meet with the
tall lunatic who snuck into your basement.
he's not a lunatic.
he was tall.
Ben Tillman?
Yeah. Who are you?
Eli James.
you broke into my friend's store last night.
you kind of scared the hell out of her.
I didn't break in. The door was open.
that begs the question, what were you doing there in the first place?
well, best I can remember,
I was working in one of the run-off drains by the river,
and all of a sudden, these lights started flickering on and off in the tunnels.
so you followed them?
Yeah.
I checked the bulbs.
and then the next thing I knew, I was in that store.
it's ok if you think I'm nuts.
most people do, including me,
so if you want to press charges, go ahead.
it's probably better for everyone if I was locked up.
I'm a psychologist.
maybe I can help.
a shrink. No, thanks.
tried that already.
tried everything.
tried everything for what?
my memory is whacked.
stuff I'm supposed to remember, can't.
stuff I shouldn't remember, can't help it.
what do you mean, stuff you shouldn't remember?
stuff that never could have happened to me.
at least according to my ex-wife.
has it always been like that, or did something happen?
Yeah, something happened.
I died.
how?
well, they tell me I was at this party 3 years ago,
and the balcony collapsed.
I was technically dead.
but they managed to revive me.
of course, I don't remember any of it,
just waking up with absolutely no idea who I was or how I got there.
I didn't know my family.
my own face in the mirror.
they should have left me dead.
why are you so interested?
because I think I know the reason
why you ended up in my friend's basement.
listen, this is going to sound crazy...
wait a minute, I don't want any more crazy, ok?
now whoever you are,
just leave me alone.
I don't want your help, ok? - Ben...
no, no, leave me alone!
now I'm sorry I scared your friend, ok?
but maybe she should be scared.
maybe you should be scared, too.
Melinda, it's me.
you're not going to believe this.
Dr. Byrd?
I know that you can hear me,
and I know about Ben.
you do?
he's a step-in, isn't he?
I'm not familiar with that term.
it's been quite a few years since I've practiced.
you know what I'm talking about.
a ghost that steps into a vacated body.
that's what he is, that's why he's so confused.
you seem to know quite a lot about these step-ins.
you said that there was more.
did you mean more like Ben?
what do you think I mean?
don't talk to me like I'm one of your patients.
what do you want from me?
what I always want... I want to help.
well, I don't want your help.
and leave Ben alone.
your husband's just gonna get worse, you know.
it's a pattern I've seen many times before,
and it never ends well.
confusion, amnesia, psychosis,
destructive rage.
I guess you could say it's the price one pays for cheating death.
death always wins.
Sam is different. Jim is different.
he's strong, he's remembering.
that's not what you told your friend Delia.
what I told her is that I couldn't help him.
that doesn't mean that he can't be helped.
he just needs time. - Time is the enemy.
your husband's been a step-in for what, a month or two?
Ben Tillman's been in the same limbo for 3 years.
I'm sorry to say, he's on the same path as all the rest.
those souls attack themselves
until there's nothing left to attack but us.
then why did you bring Ben to me?
I told you... I want to help.
if you can find a way to save Ben,
then maybe, just maybe,
there's a chance you could save your husband.
just what I need.
detective Blair says Ben has a record.
what did he do?
2 years ago, he beat the crap out of a total stranger, some random guy walking into a restaurant.
he's been violent before?
you mean before his brush with death?
no, nothing on record.
OK, so then assuming that Dr. Byrd was right
and that his spirit is gone
and someone else's soul is in there,
isn't it possible that the spirit
could have been violent to being with?
you're basically hoping that some violent psychopath
took over a good guy's body.
that's something to root for.
well, it's better than the alternative,
that some good soul is eating itself alive,
and I'm not gonna have that be Jim's punishment for...
loving you?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
I...
OK, um,
ever since... ever since Jim woke up,
he's been having these flashes of memories,
but if he wasn't talking to somebody like me who could make sense of them...
people think he's losing his mind.
right. So who did Ben wake up to?
and what did he say that could give us a clue about who he was?
or who he really is.
so this is your new place?
Yeah.
Thanks, Ned. Thanks for bringing this.
sure.
I guess Melinda was busy.
how is she?
OK, I guess.
she, uh, say anything?
um, "could you take this to Sam?
what's that, like your journal or something?
you want a drink? Nothing?
no, I'm fine.
journal? No, it's, uh,
it's a daily planner. Have a seat.
you ever seen one of these things?
it's kind of like a paper PDA.
OK. - Here, check that out.
shower, shave, brush teeth, stove off,
burners off, all four.
geez, did you really need this?
as it turns out, I didn't,
but serious amnesiacs do, so...
and everyday I would wake up and I'd wonder what I'd forgotten from the day before, so I wrote everything down,
see? Everything. I made these huge lists just to be sure.
it's funny. - What?
you see that Carter? You see that name carter?
ever since I started making that list,
that is the one guy I have no idea who he is.
I thought you said your short-term memory was ok.
it is, it's great.
Carter's not on my phone.
my sister doesn't know who he is.
he's nobody I work with. Who's Carter?
maybe...
what?
maybe he's not from, you know,
that life.
right. It's from Jim.
there's this bike shop in town, called Carter's.
it's small, just for serious cyclists.
and Jim, he was way into riding.
Yeah. It's unbelievable.
what? - What, did Melinda put this in my head, too?
did Melinda put Carter in my head?
what do you mean?
look, I know that you and your mom love Melinda,
and I respect that.
and I also know that you were very close to Jim.
that has nothing to do with it.
I'm not a kid.
I don't believe in the tooth fairy.
but I believe in Melinda,
and what she believes.
Ned, don't you think I want to believe in it, too?
you know?
I mean, how great would that be that you die
and then just step into someone else's life?
Yeah, I want to believe in that.
except I can't, Ned,
because it doesn't make any damn sense.
no.
my ex-husband Ben was treated at Providence Care Clinic.
how did you come across his case again?
I was researching a journal on memory loss.
his neurologist was cited.
well, if you're looking for some insight,
I'm probably the last person who can help you.
why is that?
because I don't understand anything that happened.
losing one's memory completely,
it's maddening.
I watched what it did to him.
I would try and tell him things about who he was, who we were,
and it was like it didn't stick.
it only confused him more.
and...
go on, Anne.
it was like he didn't want to remember.
like he was holding on to something else.
some images that... they never happened.
what kind of images?
places he thought we'd been.
songs he wouldn't have liked.
and people's names.
he used to call me Clarissa...
when he was half-asleep or wasn't thinking.
can you imagine... after twenty years...
so the divorce.
he didn't want to be with me.
after work, he wouldn't come home.
I'd call him on his cell,
and he'd be sitting on the same bus bench.
night after night.
like he was waiting for someone.
maybe he was waiting for her.
hurry, send the police now!
he is here again.
Oh, my god. Quickly, I don't see him anymore!
he could be at my door!
he could be...
just give me a chance to talk to her.
no, Eli.
Oh, come on! You can't come and tell me about a crime
if there's nothing I can do about it.
that's just teasing.
I called you because I'm wondering
what you know about this guy Ben Tillman,
her peeping Tom.
the one who's record you asked me about.
where is he?
he's in custody, getting his psych exam.
then he's going into city jail.
Eli, he could be out on bail as soon as tomorrow.
is he a patient of yours?
confidential.
see? How does that feel, hmm?
is he dangerous?
is he dangerous?
I don't know.
Clarissa. That's her name, isn't it?
I can't tell you that.
that would be a violation of her privacy.
look, just tell me one thing.
is she by any chance a widow?
Oh, come on. I could find out online in 5 seconds.
Yeah.
she lost her husband 3 years ago.
and your guy Ben Tillman's been hanging around,
freaking her out ever since.
imagine the timing on that.
Yeah, imagine.
Thanks.
Clarissa's husband dies.
Anne Tillman's has a near-death experience
and comes back a different man, her words.
calling her Clarissa and hanging around his old home.
and get this... the man that Ben randomly attacked?
that was Clarissa's dead husband's business partner.
OK, so then the attack wasn't random.
it was unfinished business of Joseph's that's driving him.
or it was something that Byrd put into his head.
Yeah, but where did Dr. Byrd find him?
I mean, was Joseph's spirit drawn to the tunnels?
according to his obituary,
joseph died of a protracted illness and was treated at a clinic that was housed in the same building as Byrd's sanatorium.
so Byrd was waiting?
probably right by his bedside,
saying "Welcome to the afterlife.
why the bowels of the town again?
because ghosts don't always come when they're called.
Why? What does he want?
a wild guess? He was probably trying to scare us.
or maybe it's because we have nothing to talk about.
you've done nothing to help Joseph.
I thought you wanted to help me.
but I guess Joseph is your patient,
so of course that's who you want to help.
not true. I wanted to help your husband, too.
well, then why did you pick Joseph?
I mean, there had to have been others, so why him?
the light held less interest for him.
you know, he was dying.
is that what helped you get inside his head?
when his doctors gave up on him, - I was there offering a cure. - For death.
but you didn't tell him the risks, did you?
there were some things he wanted to do and I helped him.
like attacking his old business partner?
you're a doctor. Act like one.
you want results? We need the facts.
his partner was profiting from his death at work - and at home with his wife. - Is that even true?
what does that matter? It helped him.
to get into Ben's body.
which proved that Joseph's spirit was alive and well,
even if the combination proved a little unstable.
it's not perfect, but it's working better this time.
this time?
practice makes perfect.
that's what he's doing. He's practicing,
until he gets it right.
those souls... Joseph, Jim,
they're just lab rats to him.
he's using them.
Yeah, because he wants to live again.
it's worrying me that you're not more worried.
byrd is not going to step into anyone
until he knows that there's less of a risk.
how do you know that? - He's pure evil.
and if pure evil is that bad,
how bad will pure evil be in a brand new meat suit?
what's a meat suit?
and what shrink calls somebody pure evil?
OK, he's a ghost with issues that we haven't resolved yet.
OK, yeah, and let's list those issues.
number one, he's evil. Number two, he's pure evil.
this is Ben's.
Ben? It's Melinda, are you home?
can you clarify for me
why we're breaking into someone's apartment who did time for beating up a guy?
this is why.
Oh, this guy's got issues.
wait a minute, we know these names.
they're in Joseph's file. Stanley's the father,
Jessica's the sister, and Galveston, that's where he's from.
what are you doing here?
what are we doing here?
um...what are we doing here? I don't remember.
we went to see you at work,
and your boss said that you were a no-show.
didn't even call in sick.
Oh, so now you think you got it figured out?
I flaked out 'cause I'm a nutcase?
no, believe it or not, we're probably the only two people around here
who know what's going on in your head.
how's that?
for starters, we know who Stanley is.
and Jessica, and we know why Galveston matters so much.
would you like us to tell you?
so you're serious?
well, I must be crazy, because that's the first thing that's made sense to me since my accident.
so you don't recognize the photo?
of me? No. No, but everything else you're saying.
so nothing that I remember is from Ben's life?
just the memories you've made over the past 3 years.
and my old life, my real life,
is where all of this comes from?
Clarissa. Why are so many of these in twos?
I don't know, that's just how I remember it.
cc, two 'c's.
clarissa Cooper Webb.
her initials. That's gotta be your nickname for her.
that's it, that's what I called her, cc.
so that's the woman you were watching
where you were arrested, that's your wife,
living in the house that you used to live in.
and now she's scared of me.
my own wife.
how am I gonna make her understand?
why don't you let us do it?
we've done it before, and that way, if there's a bad reaction...
I'll lose her again.
you just have to be patient.
it's a lot for someone to take in all at once.
can I help you?
Yeah, um, I found a note to myself
that I was supposed to come pick up something at your store.
and, uh, I have no idea what it was.
let me check the order book.
what name? - Sam Lucas.
Sam Lucas...
nothing here, sorry.
Yeah.
anything else I can do?
Yeah, actually.
you know, it might have been
something that belonged to a buddy of mine.
could you check his name?
what name?
Jim Clancy.
Jim Clancy...
I remember this guy.
he was so excited about this bike.
yeah?
it was a touring bike, titanium, 24 speeds.
think he was planning on taking his wife on a trip.
you know, one of these tours through wine country.
Yeah. Been ready for weeks.
if you want to pick it up...
no, I should check and see if...
Ah, don't check with his wife.
why not?
well, it's a surprise.
the bike is for her.
she doesn't know anything about it.
right.
is this a joke?
did he put you up to this?
is he here somewhere?
no, of course not. Ben stayed away.
I asked him to until I had the chance to talk to you.
because what, I'd believe this from you?
who are you?
what is this even about?
you were married to him.
whether it's possible or not, I mean,
wouldn't you want the chance to talk to your husband again if you could?
no.
and if this guy were actually Joseph, he'd know.
what do you mean?
joseph cheated on me. I told him I was leaving him.
his partner Craig risked their whole business to tell me the truth.
which, thank god, Joseph never found out.
look, in cases like this,
people sometimes don't remember all the facts,
but they do remember their feelings.
based on what I saw, Ben...Joseph...
still really loves you.
so...What?
some sad, creepy sewer worker thinks he's my husband?
I'm supposed to think that's romantic?
look, I know that it's really hard to under...
I need to go check something.
no, cc!
sorry.
why did I even... I should have stayed dead!
Oh, god.
what the hell am I?
I'm just a ghost of my own worthless life!
Ben?
you don't have much time.
time for what?
so that you can step into a body and go live life again?
you're angry with me. - Yeah, you picked up on that?
I don't expect you to understand what I did or why.
believe me, I'm beginning to wonder about it myself.
but Ben is in trouble, and if someone doesn't help him, - He's going to die again. - Well, where is he?!
Ben!
Ben?
Ben!
he's in there.
I think he wants to hurt himself.
Ben, can you hear me?
Ben!
Ben! Ben, can you hear me?
Melinda!
Ben! Will you please just go make sure that he's all right?
keep going, Ben, you're almost safe.
he's ok, but you should leave.
how do I know that you're not lying to me?
how do I know that you're not just going to step into him
the second that he dies?
you don't, but you should leave!
run!
I'm so sorry. I never intended for any of this...
just please go and tell Eli where I am!
I wanted to understand. I thought I could help people...
just go!
please!
Eli. Look, I need to talk to you.
now is not a good time.
I know you're friends with Melinda
and you're probably mad at me, but...
I said not now!
you can get to her through a utility vault.
there's a manhole cover up here ahead on the right.
Eli, what's with the crowbar? What's with the tools?
why can't we get to Melinda from above ground?
the utility vault must have led to the street before,
but it's been sealed off.
what, Melinda... what's wrong with Melinda? What's going on?
she's trapped underground. The water is rising.
what? What water? What are you talking about?
who are you talking to?
are you sure you're ready to hear this?
Eli!
a ghost told you this?
one you don't even trust in the first place?
he's making sense, and I'm not taking any chances.
this is where Ben came up when he heard Melinda's voice calling for him,
but if the water's rising as fast as Byrd says it is...
Byrd, the ghost, that's right.
Ben won't be back in time!
Eli, you know how this sounds!
reincarnated guys breaking water mains, ghosts sending messages!
what's wrong?
I'm afraid I won't get to her.
I can't really swim.
What?!
then what are you doing?!
same thing she'd do for me.
you don't even know if she's down there.
you're risking your life for nothing!
for nothing?! Is that what you think of her?
is that how afraid you are to take a chance?
stop. Stop!
you're right.
you're right, Eli.
and I can swim.
give me this.
where is she?
OK, Byrd says you go down through the door here at the bottom,
and you swim maybe 90 feet.
she's in a utility vault, just like this one, ok?
these tools are to break through a locked grate.
90 feet.
and you know all this from a ghost?
that's enough for you?
sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith.
OK?
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! oh, my god!
Sam! Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Melinda, you're safe.
you...you came for me!
of course I did.
where are we?
they must have shut off the water, it stopped rising.
Melinda...
what's going on?
it's ok, Sam, you're just confused.
you're gonna be all right
as soon as I can get us out of here.
why do you keep calling me Sam?
you don't remember.
it's the amnesia, it's ok.
honey, what amnesia?
what are you talking about?
then what do you want me to call you?
well, you can call me by my name.
just call me Jim.
what?
just call me Jim, Mel, it's my name.
Jim!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, you're back!
you're back!
you all right?
right. - Great.
all right, let's get out of here.
you must be freezing.
sit.
OK? And just... I need you to stay here
for just a few minutes. All right?
so cover up.
don't move. Don't talk to anyone.
don't call anyone. Don't...
what's going on, Mel?
uh, nothing. Just trust me, everything's fine.
is it a ghost thing?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know how weird that can be.
well, I'm here. I'm a statue.
I love you.
God, I love you so much.
me, too.
Oh, I feel horrible.
I mean...god, what you went through...
it's ok.
and you tried to get help.
no.
I tried to get even.
that's how this started.
I wanted revenge on my partner.
but that was in another life.
in this life, you helped make a miracle happen.
thank you.
it's ok.
no, I mean for what you did.
you made sense in my life,
and, uh, it's not the life that I left behind
or even what I might have chosen.
this is my second chance,
and I'm gonna do better with this than I did the first.
thank you.
Bye. - Bye.
what about you?
seen any lights?
same ones I've been seeing off and on since the day I died.
does the light really look that bad?
the truth?
it looked good.
looked too good.
I'm scared.
Why?
the emotion inside of it.
everything I'd ever learned taught me that emotion like that needed to be managed.
feared, even.
what emotion? Can you describe it?
do you really have to ask?
love.
the kind that makes a man risk everything,
over and over again
for no sensible reason.
the kind that makes sensible reasons...
and even death itself
mean nothing.
were you afraid that it would make you mean nothing?
I was just afraid.
and now?
OK.
OK.
Mel, I gotta call Sully.
he's gonna be worried that I haven't checked in.
trust me, Sully's not worried about you.
why have you made me keep my eyes closed this entire time...
because it's a surprise.
a big surprise. - All right?
OK.
OK.
you ready? - Yep.
here it goes.
all right, just... right there.
OK. - Ok?
do you promise to keep an open mind?
I promise.
I mean we're all born and reborn out of water.
you know, baptized, as it were, from the unconscious depths.
it's...
what do you think happened?
how did he suddenly get all his memories back?
well, generally, you know, healthy psyches can accommodate more than one functioning ego at a time, and if one of those egos perishes, then another one may come in and take its place, and...
so in other words, you don't have a clue.
none at all.
it's pretty quiet in there. You think she's shown him yet?
what...
what the...
this is my face now?
how did I...
you did it for us.
for me.
and I begged you not to do it, but you wouldn't listen.
I must have been out of my mind.
Yeah. I thought so, too,
like, kind of one of your worst ideas ever until today.
you still look the same.
that makes me the lucky one.
no, we both are.
Oh, my god!
Serena, baby, where are you?
this is ray, leave a message.
ray, it's karen.
I'm at home, and i'm trying not to freak out.
Serena's not here. I've looked all through the house.
I can't figure out where she is.
damn it, why can't you pick up your cell?
Hello?
hello. This is karen westen, serena's mom. Is this delia?
Yeah. Is everything ok?
I don't know. When is the last time you saw serena?
she left here about 2 hours ago, why?
is she not home yet?
I just got home from work, and her stuff is here.
and she's not, and the window's open.
OK, ok, have you tried calling her cell?
Yes, her phone is sitting right in front of me!
could somebody have broken in and stolen...
taken my girl?
OK, what about her father? Is he there? Are you alone?
I think he's still at work.
I just-I-I don't know what to do.
OK, listen, I want you to get off the phone with me
and call the police right away. I'm gonna come over, ok?
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but can you think of anyone or anything that might be causing serena distress?
you mean, something that might...make her want to run away?
could be anything.
something at home, or has anyone close to her died or been hurt?
no, no. We're all healthy. -No friends from school?
still no word from your husband?
Oh, I got him this--This cradle
that he could put his cell phone in and charge it,
and he just-- He keeps forgetting.
we should turn on oak lane. Serena has some friends that live over there.
OK.
Hey, I think I see her.
Serena, baby, thank god we found you.
are you ok? Where have you been?
what happened?
is this blood?
honey, look at me!
what's happening?!
I don't remember.
was it like someone was whispering to you?
you know, telling you that you needed to do things?
I told you, i don't remember. I was just in my room studying
and then I got a little sleepy, and then i was on the street in my bare feet.
Sweetheart...how do you feel?
mom, i'm fine! Everybody keeps freaking out, but, you know,
I just sleepwalked a little bit, ok? People do that.
what about all this red stuff all over you?
it's not blood, mom, ok?
the ambulance guys just said it was some sort of weird red clay.
but from where? There's no soil or anything around here like that.
maybe I felt like throwing a pot in my sleep. Ok, it's
you're right. Let's--Let's get you up to bed,
and we will forget that this ever happened.
Serena, sweetheart, are you ok?
I was at the sub's office working with half the department.
I'm sorry, I should have given you the number.
there's seven, you say? That's great. Your aunt's awesome for getting you that.
I'm gonna take off, ok?
all right.
Hey, serena, how's it going?
pretty great.
I just-- I wanted to let you know
that I'd be happy to take any of your study group chapters,
if things are intense at home or whatever.
mind keeping it down so the whole planet doesn't find out about what happened last night?
sorry.
well, that was weird.
Plumeria.
those must have been sphinx moths.
what? -Nothing. Just be sure to wash your hands.
these flowers are poisonous.
front door and back door both use the same key. I gave you 4 copies.
thank you.
until we figure out what happened last night, I just can't be too careful.
I think I might be able to help you with that.
I have a gift.
I can see ghosts, and i've seen a ghost attached to your daughter.
I--I don't understand.
sometimes spirits can influence people,
kind of like hypnosis, which would explain the sleepwalking.
if she's jumpy, forgetful. -Yes.
what's unclear is why.
which made me wonder...
if the spirit is trying to protect serena from something
or someone here at home.
would you like to come in?
Yes.
Hey. -Hey.
put these in my locker?
no.
sure. Ok, like anyone else would know what these mean.
are those plumeria?
and there were moths with them.
Sphinx moths, I-I think.
does that mean what I think it means?
I don't know. Well...
it just--It feels like someone's trying to send me a message.
you think?
I just--I wish I could tell them that it's ok.
look, I understand. You can tell me the truth.
me?
no one else knows what this stuff means except you, jonathan.
I understand.
what are you talking about?
look, I thought it was crazy at first myself, but...
I mean, last night, the sleepwalking, was that you?
and--and in my bedroom?
Serena! Just stop it, ok?
why are you being so weird?
I won't tell anyone.
I would never betray your secret.
you're freaking me out!
just leave me alone, freak! Understand?
mom?
why didn't my key work in the front door?
did you change the locks?
what's going on?
Melinda was worried about you,
and she had some interesting things to say.
she'd like to ask you a few questions.
something happen with dad?
we'll talk about that later.
you did it. You finally kicked him out.
Serena... you know what,
I can come back later, and if I learn anything, I'll give you a call.
I hope you don't think you fooled me like you fooled yourself.
you can't trust dad. He's a liar, ok?
you can't trust anyone.
so the bad news is, the father's cheating. The good news is, it's nothing more than that.
so instead of a protective ghost, we're back to a scary ghost.
would it be too much to ask, just once, for a helpful ghost?
Yeah, they usually go straight into the light.
I don't think that this ghost is bad, I just think he's trying to protect serena.
cause he chalk dusted that kid who was mean to her?
well, he put all this nasty stuff in her locker
and then tried to make her feel bad about it.
did you learn anything about who the kid is?
Yeah, his name's jonathan.
Ned did some asking around, and I guess he's kind of a loner.
were they dating?
no one thinks so. Is it possible that jonathan didn't do anything?
I mean, the ghost could have put that stuff in her locker, right?
Yeah, it's possible.
this is a powerful ghost.
well, I just need to get the whole story.
great idea, but from who? The ghost isn't exactly
Hey! Hello?
um, sorry to come by so late. If you're closing the store...
it's fine. I can keep it open.
Thanks. Yep.
did you just hang up on me?
Hello?!
so my mom told me that you guys talked.
you know, about the dead guy.
Yeah. Look, I know that it can be scary, but we just need to figure out
so they're real?
like, they're really real?
and they're right here with us, like part of this world?
like, they can touch things and touch us?
in their own way, yeah.
so they can, like, hypnotize you?
well, that's not exactly what's happening, but the effect is the same.
look, we just need to figure out who it is that's haunting you
so we can help them move on.
Oh. You mean they can't stay.
it's best if they don't.
look, just try really hard to think about if you know someone
or remember anyone who might have feelings for you.
the guy who died, you mean?
what makes you think it was a guy?
Oh, well, isn't that what you told my mom?
I might have.
but does it ring a bell? I mean, a guy who died?
I'm--I'm not sure, really.
what did he look like? She said that you saw someone.
I did. Yeah, he was young, about your age.
Really? Weird.
well, I wonder if this guy knows Jonathan, too.
Yeah, Ned was saying that after Jonathan put all that stuff in your locker,
that he yelled at you in class.
did you two date? I mean, 'cause it could be somebody who's jealous
no, no, Jonathan and I, we were just into the same, like, movies
and books and stuff, but that's it.
that's not what the ghost seems to think.
what ghost?
the ghost that we're talking about.
or did you think that we were talking about something else?
It's--You know, it's getting really late
and I told my mom that I wouldn't be too long,
so I'm just gonna go, but thank you.
Hello? You have reached my apology line.
please leave an apology for rudely hanging up on me at the beep. Beep!
OK, 'm sorry. Serena came in and I didn't have much time.
try and sound like you mean it. Beep, beep, beep!
all right, it was extremely rude. Will you please listen?
I mean, how many times do we meet someone who's being haunted
who wants to stay haunted?
not often enough.
Yeah, she came in here with all these questions about being haunted,
but never once how to stop it, and then when I actually mentioned the word "ghos,"
she acted like we were having 2 completely different conversations.
OK, that's odd.
and I think that she's covering something up,
because I think this Jonathan guy is involved somehow.
OK, let's make a list, starting with weird, random things that we don't undetand.
like sleepwalking, sphinx moths, plumeria flowers, flying dust, red clay soil
what, now it's vampires?
vampires? No, we're talking about a ghost.
ghosts and vampires.
and the last time I saw you, you were asking me about voodoo.
what has happened to you?
OK. Let's take a walk.
Hello?
did you just hang up on me?
Touche.
I don't believe it.
you can't not believe it.
how many times have we argued about this?
how many times did you tell me this stuff was real?
well, now I'm finally agreeing with you.
I want them all back!
what, the cds? I know you thought it was weird,
splitting them alphabetically, but
the hours and hours that we spent arguing about this. I want them all back.
well, it's kinda funny when you think about it.
it's not funny. You think it's funny?
no, not at all.
you seem angry with me.
no, no, don't.
don't be sad. Come on,
please don't be sad.
I'd rather have mad, please.
come on, look at me.
look at what a jerk I am.
what a total, worthless, crap-ass jerk.
but you're not. I'm not?
a person can't help what they believe.
and it's too late.
it's too late?
it's too late?
so what's all this with vampires? I thought you talked to ghosts.
I don't know anything about vampires. You mentioned vampires.
you listed 5 distinct aspects of vampire myths--Sleepwalking, moths, flying dust
OK, whoa, hold up, wait one second.
what does all that have to do with vampires?
except the sleepwalking, which I remember from one of the draculas.
eastern european tradition says vampires sleep in soil of their home country,
hence your red clay. And in malaysia,
they believe that the plumeria flower attracts creatures of the night.
and the thing about bats-- Bats?
I never mentioned bats.
lots of cultures believe vampires transform themselves into airborne entities like bats and moths,
but also, lighter things like dust and smoke.
so my ghost is a vampire.
I don't know what you're dealing with,
but what you're describing is basically elements from a classic vampire seduction scenario.
seduction? -Yes.
seduction, when somebody uses someone's vulnerabilities
to lure them into a relationship that only brings them pain.
Oh. That.
please!
it's ok, I-- I'm glad you're here.
it's ok. I understand if you're angry.
I shouldn't have said anything to melinda...
or you.
OK.
good.
you're still here.
show yourself to me?
nothing unusual, except she seemed very happy and relaxed.
a teenage girl happy and relaxed?
we better call someone.
OK, help me out here. This ghost thinks he's a vampire?
I don't know, but he's convinced her of that.
all right, now show me this very interesting young man.
well, this is Jonathan, the guy got dust in his eyes in Serena's class.
what about him?
well, I don't know. Except I caught a small glimpse of him at Delia's apartment,
but the ghost kinda looks like this guy.
you said the ghost had red eyes. And ned said the kid's eyes red in the chalk dust.
and you said Jonathan's not a ghost, which means...
should we start looking for wooden stakes?
OK, there's no such thing as vampires. Believe me, I would know.
tell that to Zoe. Ok, look, forget whether there really are vampires or not.
can someone explain to me why a teenage girl would want to be stalked by one?
are you kidding me? Have you been to a multiplex or a bookstore recently?
Oh, I get there's that whole deal, but what's the appeal? I don't get it.
I--They live forever.
they ache, they yearn and they desire forever.
right. So that's what she gets from consorting with a vampire? An eternal ache?
with a vampire? An eternal ache?
no, she gets undying love.
come on. You understand this?
of course she does.
Oh. What I did?
jumping into this body?
come on. I'm just a pigheaded fool who wouldn't quit.
that's what every woman wants?
Yeah.
well, then is it really fair you don't share me with the world?
point being,
undying love's in short supply in a broken home like serena's.
well, more important point, we still don't know who this guy is.
no Grandview teenagers meeting the ghost description died recently.
you know what, she's lived here her whole life.
maybe we should be looking at people who moved away.
Hey. Where to?
Serena said that vampires like to keep soil from their home country close.
Yeah, like the red clay that was on her after she sleepwalked.
wait a minute, there are red cliffs just south of bridgeport.
good call.
from bridgeport, died about 5 weeks ago
and formerly resided in Grandview.
does he look like the ghost?
Yeah. Said that he had a blood disease, which would explain the red eyes.
or maybe he got bit,
and that would explain why he started sleeping upside down.
OK, you keep working on that theory there, van helsing,
and I am going to go talk to Serena.
Hey, have a minute?
now's not really a good time.
I know about Andrew Carlin.
Andrew? What about him?
well, I know that he's dead, and I think you know that.
andrew died?
you didn't know?
how would I? He moved away like 2 or 3 years ago.
well, I thought you two were really close.
I mean we were friends, but obviously not as good as I thought.
so you didn't keep in touch after that.
he wrote a few emails, but was never really good at answering them,
and after that, like, nothing.
look, I'm sorry that I have to ask this,
but were you and andrew into vampires?
was that something that the two of you shared together?
look, I really have to go.
well, whatever it is that's going on,
I think you're going to want to hear me out.
look, I really don't think you know what you're talking about.
andrew wasn't into vampires, ok, he was into yearbook.
that's how we knew each other. We did yearbook together.
so he just wanted you to think that he was a vampire
because you're into that stuff?
it doesn't make any sense. Andrew?
wait, the part that doesn't make any sense is andrew?
so what, you thought it was jonathan?
is that why you confronted him in class,
because you thought he put all that stuff in your locker?
you said that you two like the same books and movies
look, it's not just that, ok?
jonathan and I both have really screwed up families.
he just--He gets it.
OK, this is partially my fault,
because I--I was talking to you about ghosts,
and you thought that I was talking to you about vampires,
and I made you think that they were real, but they're not.
I know what I saw.
I know what I felt.
ghosts can be powerful.
OK? They can make us believe things.
but he was with me last night!
I didn't see him, but I know he was there.
I'm sure andrew was there.
he was at your locker making sure that you got those flowers.
and he was there making sure that Jonathan paid for trying to hurt you.
that's why Jonathan won't talk to me anymore.
I really am a freak.
please.
there's a boy out there.
another boy who has very strong feelings for you.
you can help him go into the light where he belongs.
I can't.
come here.
what are you doing to me?
I gave you eternity.
doesn't she deserve the same?
who, Serena?
what gives you the only right to happiness?
what are you talking about?
you cheated death once.
doesn't mean you will again.
Serena is mine.
one way or another, I'll have her.
Wow. That's all I can say. Wow.
have you contacted andrew's family?
now that is what I call a dream.
woof! Grr. -Eli, please focus. I really need your help, all right?
look, I'm on my way to Serena's. I don't have time to track them down.
OK, but could you just talk to me again?
just let me put on a little mood music first.
Eli! -What?
the ghost said that he's going to have her one way or another, ok?
in case that means having her dead, I gotta get this guy into the light,
especially 'cause she's so vulnerable at home.
I thought you said that the parents decided to try therapy.
Eli! -Ok! Ok, I'm calling them now. Relax.
Yeah, I'll relax when I know that Serena's ok.
all right.
I know I'm the one that messed up.
I made you two suffer, a lot. And that's wrong.
and without getting into some stuff
that you don't want to know,
let's just say that your mom did some things
to push me away.
Karen, is that fair to say?
Yeah.
so how about it? Fresh start?
can everyone do that?
no way. Forget it.
Serena, honey, please!
mom, it's bull. He doesn't deserve it.
you know what? Your father is asking for a second chance, and I think we should give it to him.
that's not fair!
it may not be, but that's what love is.
no, it's not.
love is supposed to mean more than that.
you don't just leave it and come back to it like daddy did.
love is something you never quit.
sweetheart...
we are a family, and family is forever,
and there is nothing else like that.
you're wrong.
are you doing this to torture me, or do you really care?
Andrew, I never got any of these.
they're just drafts?
why didn't you send them?
you were there the entire time, you never quit.
I wish I could just see you.
how?
Serena, sweetheart?
we need to talk to you.
we're coming in
Oh, my god!
all right, call any of her friends that you can think of,
and I'll let you know if I hear anything.
thank you. Ok.
Hey, eli.
she's gone? She ran away?
well, at least there's a chance that she'll change her mind.
as opposed to she's sleepwalking over a cliff.
so what did you find out about our ghost?
I finally got through to his mother.
I just hung up a few minutes ago. I said I was Serena's dad.
And?
and she remembers it like Serena said, they did yearbook together.
but then after that, stories get different.
well, how so?
well, Andrew told the parents that he stayed in touch with her after they left Grandview.
he kept pictures of her on his desk, sent them updates on her life,
claiming they Imed all the time.
OK, was there any red clay near andrew's house?
no. And can you imagine how weird she thought I was to ask.
OK, well, what about where he was buried?
damn, you're good. Almost as good as me.
all right, I called the cemetery right after I hung up with the mom.
you ready to write down an address?
what's it like where you are?
is it lonely?
it's so lonely here, I don't want to be lonely anymore!
then go inside.
we can talk when you're with me.
so where is he buried, exactly?
Andrew's parents said there's a family crypt,
but you should hurry, because it's tight.
there's only a few shelves for cremated remains.
so there isn't much air, then?
she wouldn't last long.
OK. So then which crypt?
I don't know. Just look for the one with his name on it. How long can that take?
I can't keep my eyes open, andrew.
where are you?
why won't you just give me a sign?
I'm right here, Serena.
you'll see me soon. Very soon.
where is she?
she wants to be with me. That's why she came here.
you don't really believe that, or else we wouldn't be having this nice conversation.
what conversation?
the one where you pretend that you don't feel bad for killng a girl that you supposedly love.
I don't want her to die.
but she has to.
it's the only way that we can be together,
you know, for someone who isn't actually a vampire,
you're doing a great impression.
I mean, the sneaking around, the hypnosis, the smokescreen
shut up! You don't know anything.
I know what's going to happen when she's finally dead.
she's going to look back at her young, full life,
and she's going to realize that she gave it all up for a lie.
what lie?
that you loved her.
you don't love her, andrew.
love is selfless.
you're only doing this for you.
I do love her.
I've always loved her.
then prove it.
where is she?
Oh, my god!
sweetheart, could you just wake up?
please? Please?
all right, you're going to be all right, just breath.
all right, let's get you out of here, come on.
sweetheart! Honey, are you ok?
are you all right?!
he led her here
hoping that she would join him.
he realized he had made a mistake, and then he helped me find her.
and she went along?
he didn't sleepwalk her or...
or use hypnosis?
no.
you would rather be dead than come home?
I didn't think of it like that.
I don't know what I was thinking. I just...
she was alone.
andrew says she was alone.
alone?
but she has a family.
so many people are so much more alone than anyone knows.
he says not just Serena.
most of us are more alone than anyone knows.
we feel like we're on the outside looking in,
like we're freaks or maybe even monsters.
till we meet someone who understands, and...
there's nothing more powerful than that.
does that make any sense?
Yes.
I am so...
so sorry.
I just-- I didn't think.
and to just expect you to give me a second chance...
I understand.
Melinda...will you please tell Andrew that I'm really sorry?
he was always one of my favorite people.
I just--I never guessed that I meant more than that to him.
I was afraid to tell her the truth.
because if she didn't feel the same way...
he was afraid that you would break his heart.
I hope I didn't break it again.
no. No, I think you helped put it back together.
Yeah.
Melinda told me that there's a place that you can go where you won't be alone.
he knows.
he sees the light.
I'm gonna be there someday myself, I hope.
you promise you'll look for me?
Yeah.
he's gone.
I'm so sorry!
it's all right, baby
come on,Eeli, you have to have an opinion. Dj or band?
DJ. Always.
and make sure he spins vinyl,
but no sixties, no motown, and no open mic.
and no fun. I mean, what kind of weddings do you go to?
same kind you go to.
boring.
I wonder where Zoe is.
I mean, she wanted to know how this vampire thing went.
didn't she say that she might miss it because she's got a lot of work to do?
well, I just thought since Melinda was here...
are you here?
what? Yes, yes, vampires. Yeah.
Yeah, it's just-- It's just a dream.
wow, is it really that late?
Oh, look at that. It is.
the hours fly by. Fly.
do you mind if we,
I mean, we can stay a few more minutes to see if she's coming.
Just--Will you get a room for god sakes?
OK, thank you.
you're not fooling anyone.
this place reeks of pheromones.
OK, well, what about the check?
don't worry, it's my turn.
don't give me the pity eye.
look, I see a couple of guys I recognize from the econ department over at the bar,
and boy, can those geeks get crazy.
might have to clear out my whole morning.
OK. Have fun.
breathe, breathe-- I'm trying, I'm trying!
it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!
in with the good air, out with the bad.
OK, breathe. We're almost there, ok?
Melinda, I'm right here. Just keep breathing.
this is it, this is it, around the corner?
there we are, number 4, that's it.
it's ok. And one, two, three.
you gotta push! Ok, ok, ok.
it's ok, come on, Mel!
push! One, two, three.
you did great.
can I see my baby?
don't you mean "babies"?
what?
how bad was that one?
well, let's just say "meow" and leave it at that.
you think maybe you should mention these dreams to your doctor?
no, no, I'm sure it's nothing.
I got my dress today.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, you think I could have a little look?
uh, absolutely not.
OK? Store remains off limits until further notice.
that's breathtaking.
really, you think?
well said.
why don't you put your eyes back in your head and give me one of those lattes.
are you sure it's not too much? I mean
no. Definitely not.
she was asking me.
and it is perfect.
you're perfect.
all right.
I know. All right.
let's cut me out of this thing. I'm gonna be late for lunch with Eli.
I'm Gordon Brady.
and I'm here to give you the wedding of your dreams.
you must not be too familiar with my dreams.
who are you?
some call me a wedding planner, Others a dream weaver.
you can call me an ambassador of love.
didn't your mother tell you?
no.
no, my mother didn't tell me.
a surprise. I hope that doesn't hinder cooperation.
your mother reached out to me to look after your wedding day.
she said, and I quote, make it unforgettable.
nice dress, by the way. Is the lace a must?
it just clashes ever so slightly With the linens I had in mind.
OK, all right, maybe we should just take a breath for a minute.
no, no, no, you take a breath. In, in, in. Hold.
gordon is here. It's my wedding now.
didn't see you there.
um, Eli, this is Jeremy Bishop.
how you doing?
Jeremy and I met at the university.
Jeremy is going to the
no, it's fine. No need to explain, really.
explain what?
anything, really. Explanations are usually boring in general.
So...you guys are having lunch?
um, yeah.
how's that going?
it's a little too early to tell.
meaning we just got our salads.
um, are you here by yourself?
no, no, I have a lunch date.
female one. - Good for you!
nothing serious. Just playing the field.
I mean, out in the field playing.
I mean, I'm just... running the bases, just trying to...
get to the stadium. I-- There she is.
all right. So better never than late, So you guys...be good. Yeah. You...
Bye.
did you bring a shovel? - Why?
because I need to be hit with one, hard, in the face right now.
I didn't really feel like a sit-down lunch anyway.
so because you're jealous of Zoe and that guy, I have to have lunch at the umbrella room?
jealous? Please.
I could care less who Zoe has lunch with.
who is this guy? It's driving me nuts.
the last time I saw Zoe, she was in tears
because the university's selling its book collection to raise money.
Ouch.
the next thing I know, her and George Clooney are feeding each other bon bons at lunch.
can we please talk about my dream?
OK. So you're in the delivery room and you ask to see your baby.
Yes, and then the nurse says,"Don't you mean babies?"Plural.
then she wheels out this basinet full of
kittens. - Kittens.
how did you know that?
cause it's a totally typical Pregnant woman dream.
sometimes its puppies, but either way, there's usually paws involved.
Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry.
you know what, I should probably get going anyway, and I'm sorry for being distracted.
next time we have lunch, promise, totally present.
OK, well, bring a shovel.
just in case.
what are you doing here?
there's something you need to know.
what?
your future is in her hands.
it's a matter of life and death.
can you see us?
wait a minute. He said her?
your future is in her hands.
what does he mean?
I don't know, he was looking at my belly.
maybe he just got it, you know, backwards.
Yeah, I don't think the watchers do an opposite day.
then maybe we need to go to your doctor and ask him whether or not we're having a boy or girl.
we said we didn't want to know.
no, no, you said, and then I was pressured into
no, I said that I wanted it to be a surprise, and you agreed.
you're right.
now Eli says that weird dreams are typical of pregnant women, so maybe this qualifies.
um, when have you ever had a typical dream?
I know. Look, I just-- I don't want to worry about anything else,
you know, especially with this big wedding.
and really, a big wedding, it just doesn't feel right.
I hear you. But look, if your mom wants to do this, I think we should let her, you know?
I mean, it's just her way of saying she cares.
no, it is her way of dealing with guilt
because she doesn't even come back from her trip until the day before the wedding.
here's to your mom.
and to the comfort of predictability.
And...to our big wedding.
because no matter how big it gets, it's still just about you and me.
here's to that.
who are you?
and, uh, at that point, well, you know, I warned him not to move and I told him to drop the book.
we struggled.
had him pinned pretty good, but, uh, he managed to get past me.
Dr. James, I might have thought you'd be in the middle of all of this.
it's good to see you, too, sir.
Zoe Ramos, this is Mr. Bedford, chairman of the fundraising committee.
Oh, really? Just the person I wanted to speak to.
you know, I've been researching the Von Drake collection
Oh, luckily we only lost one book and it was the least valuable of the bunch,
so we can still make a sale.
still combing your hair with a firecracker I see, Dr. James.
pleasure.
likewise.
he loves me. He just-- He has affection issues.
you were very brave.
well, you know, you don't think in situations like that.
you just act, you know.
he's wrong about that book.
the one that was stolen?
I've been studying it. It's very valuable.
it's special.
it shouldn't end up in the wrong hands.
speaking of being in the wrong hands, is it serious?
you and the lunch guy.
what is it? Better table manners?
Oh, no, I knew it was a bad idea for us to reconnect.
we said we should keep our distance when we broke up, and we should have just stuck to that.
look, I know you're stressed out...
damn right I'm stressed!
do you know that the school is selling the entire Von Drake collection?
these are books that I have spent years studying!
Hey, I hear you. Ok.
so let me take you to dinner tomorrow night.
that's you hearing me? Inviting me on a date?
No! That's me telling you that I can be a grown-Up.
and we can have a platonic dinner and learn to just be friends.
come on, I'll take you to a terrible restaurant with bad lighting and no atmosphere.
it'll be great. Huh?
well, I'm really glad you're all right.
if that had been me, I would have screamed and frozen in place.
well, you never know how you're gonna...
anyway, point is, he only got away with one book.
a valuable book, according to Zoe.
there was a book in my dream.
the kittens had a book?
I'm way past the kittens.
no, this was a little girl with no face,
and she kept showing me a book-- Leather, old, bound.
just like the one that was stolen.
and not only that, but right after the last time that I saw you, I saw one of those watchers.
and he said that my future was in her hands.
whose hands? - I don't know.
my kid's? I mean, could this be connected in some way?
what was in that book that was stolen.
I was too much in a jealous rage to really follow up.
I'm having dinner with Zoe tonight, though. I'll find out more.
Ooh, dinner?
Yeah, but it's just to prove that, uh, we can spend meaningless time together.
Oh, wow, that sounds great.
well, good news.
I've managed to rearrange the entire floor plan to accommodate the orchestra.
orchestra? I thought I had a DJ.
you have such a quirky sense of humor.
but the problem remains of getting you in and out of the church.
problem? - Musically speaking.
but the solution came to me on my way here.
it was a message... from cupid.
I have one word for you--Bagpipes.
Hey, it's Zoe. You know what to do, so do it.
so I guess being 45 minutes late is part of the zero romance policy we're pursuing.
not now, go away.
are you all right? Let me in.
everything's changed.
what are you talking about?
let me in!
I'm sorry. It's just I'm in a totally different place right now.
can you just come back later or something?
is there someone in there with you?
I need to be by myself right now.
Eli, I'm all right. Just go away, please.
as soon as I see for myself.
I'm kind of confused right now. Please just leave.
why won't you just leave me alone?!
No! - Eli, just go.
please, just go.
Eli, please, this has noing to do with you. Just walk out the door.
Eli, please, just leave.
I didn't touch her, I swear!
I don't even know how I got here!
do you have any reason to believe that Zoe knew the intruder?
I don't think so,
Zoe didn't see him when he broke in the library.
what do you think happened?
well, the intruder claims that Zoe was coming down the stairs.
she freaked when she saw him and lost her footing.
this can't be happening.
I'm waiting for her to just come in and just say it was all a joke. I
look, get some rest, all right?
if I need anything else, I'll call you.
she's here.
is there anything that you want to say to Eli before you cross over?
I can't cross over.
why not?
I know what I have to do now, and I can't go until it's done.
this is too much information. I gotta go home.
he's just a common street thief, really.
half a dozen arrests for breaking and entering.
there are warrants out for him in several other counties.
I'm glad he's off the streets.
Yeah, this arrest is going to solve a lot of cases.
we're waiting for the public defender's office to send someone over to represent him.
did Eli tell you what I wanted?
look, it's a little unusual, but Eli's helped us on a lot of cases
so I'm happy to do the favor.
just know that when I say 5 minutes, I mean it.
got it.
I heard you say you didn't know how you got to that house.
I don't. It was the same thing with the library.
it's like I don't have any say in it, like I was sleepwalking or something.
what were you doing at the house?
what were you trying to steal?
I wasn't trying to steal anything!
look, I know that it can be hard to
I wasn't supposed to take anything.
I was supposed to put something there.
what?
I got nothing else to say.
Hey, it's Zoe. You know what to do, so do it.
I don't know if you're listening...
if you're still here.
I feel like I have so many things I want to say I'm sorry for.
and if I could just see you, just hear you,
just one more time,
even if it's just to say good-bye,
I would just...
what are you doing? Eli!
you put people on medication for doing things like this.
sir, excuse me, is the library up ahead?
Yeah, sure, it's right down here, you'll see it.
Mr. Bedford...
who is that guy?
that guy is Jeremy Bishop.
he represents the collector who is buying the entire Von Drake collection,
which is saving our bacon.
and the check that he's writing will help keep you paid for the next 2 semesters.
I don't think I need that exact example, But ok.
try not to touch anything.
so you really think this thief doesn't know why he broke in the library or Zoe's?
he described it as sleepwalking.
wait, you don't think that...
a ghost could be controlling him? Could be.
but why? Why steal that book? Why break into Zoe's?
he said he felt like he was meant to put something there.
the book?
well, yeah. The book is the one common thread.
I mean, my dream, Zoe, the thief.
and I just found out the guy Zoe was having lunch with
is buying the whole Von Drake collection from the university.
Yeah, see, why would she be having lunch with the guy who took her books away?
I mean, how is he connected in all this?
we gotta talk to Zoe.
I can't get her to come to me.
do you think she crossed over?
no, but I haven't seen her either.
listen, if we don't find Zoe, We have to find that book.
I know that look.
that's the "we gotta sneak into some place we don't belong" look.
we shouldn't be breaking into Zoe's house.
Zoe won't mind.
what if we get caught?
well, I'll let you do all the talking.
Where'd you learn how to do that?
what, you think just because I'm an academic I don't have any other skills?
evidently you don't know me very well.
evidently the door was open the entire time.
well, I loosened it.
guess there's no bonus miles for breaking and entering.
where do we start?
it would have to be somewhere on the first floor.
he never got upstairs.
what do we do?
grab him. - What?!
whoever the guy is, he might have answers.
just grab him like you did the guy in the library.
listen, about the guy in the library, it wasn't so much I grabbed him
Eli, just go.
Zoe was begging me not to buy the Von Drake collection,
or at least let the book stay at the university
so she could continue her research.
so that's what that lunch was about.
so what did you tell her?
I told her I'd think about it.
so what, you were just gonna string her along?
it was a good excuse to see her again.
so shoot me.
what are you doing here?
well, when someone tried to steal the books, I thought maybe Zoe was behind it.
you actually think Zoe would stoop to stealing books?
she was a professor.
said the professor who just broke into Zoe's house,
looking for the same thing I am, I am sure.
the missing book.
seems we all thought it was here.
you know, I thought it was the least valuable one,
so why would you risk breaking and entering just to find it?
why would you?
there are many different definitions of valuable.
the people that I work for want the complete set.
who exactly do you work for?
privileged.
so, do we call the police on each other, Or do we all just walk away?
I'd go for the walk away thing.
please don't hide from me.
we need to talk.
please?
I'm here.
you know, just because I'm an insecure, jealous maniac, is no reason to ignore me.
I came because you almost got hurt tonight.
you need to step away from this.
you'll understand everything someday.
I need to know now, zoe.
what's in that book?
where is it?
the book is the key to everything.
the book is always changing-- New things are written, old things are erased.
you still there?
there's others here.
there are so many things on this side that I don't understand yet.
Yeah, well, it's not much better on this side, I can tell you that.
the book taught me what I have to do, Who I have to help.
when the time comes, I'll be there to guide you.
guide me where?
you didn't have to apologize for not believing me.
I knew you didn't.
it wasn't that, I
you listened to me.
even thought you didn't believe...
that's what I loved.
Zoe, I miss you.
excuse me, but did you just say horse and carriage?
breathtaking, isn't it?
the entire wedding party arrive at the reception hall by horse and carriage.
the whole thing just drips romance, If I know I say it myself.
I know that you're an artist, but really
please, there's no need to state the obvious, but thank you.
now, your mother has called and announced that another family contingent are flying in from Vermont-Cousins.
half a dozen. Well, six to be exact.
but don't worry.
we need a bigger reception hall anyway.
we simply cannot fit a decent-sized arbor in this space.
it's impossible.
you know what, I have to go get something from the basement.
OK.
now, the rooftop is available at the sunset manor,
but then there are weather worries, and the carpet there's just dreadful.
what do you want?
you can't.
can't what?
save her.
you can't.
look...
you're in a fair amount of trouble, but I can help you.
the people I work for have a lot of resources.
we can get you a decent attorney, maybe even arrange bail.
how?
before I can help you, I have to know one thing.
Where's the book?
the what?
the book you took from the library.
did you put it in the woman's house, did you hide it somewhere?
dude, I don't even know how I got in that house.
why won't anyone believe me?
maybe it's because you're a low-life thief.
look at me.
look at my eyes.
now think.
remember.
think harder.
we're not letting you anywhere near that book.
you're overmatched.
do you really think you can stop us with marionette tricks?
you all right?
not really.
Melinda, tell me, these visions you're having. They're all of a little girl, right?
I just know this is about our baby, I just know it.
no, Mel, it's not.
it's not, trust me.
what makes you so sure?
what are you not telling me?
look, are you sure you want to know?
don't mess with me right now, please.
our child is not going to be a she.
we're gonna have a little boy.
you know?
Yeah.
how? I thought that we were gonna
I know, I didn't do it on purpose, but I found a little note attached to your last sonogram.
and I wasn't going to tell you, but
a boy? - yeah.
I really miss pizza.
pizza made me happy.
who is that?!
I need your help.
you've really got to find that book before Jeremy Bishop does.
Yeah, well, it's not like we haven't been trying.
who are you?
not important.
are you one of the watchers?
that sounds so pretensions. Just call me Carl.
Carl. Yeah, I remember you.
Carl the watcher.
did you have to come when I was in my underwear, Carl?
don't worry about it.
since I've been dead, I've walked in on lots worse.
who's this Jeremy guy anyway?
it's not so much about Jeremy as who controls him and what they want.
the book has been safe up to now because it was hidden in the larger collection.
but then Jeremy found out about it?
Yes, and he was sent to buy the collection, so I took control of that repulsive little thief,
and made him steal the book and then I made him put it in Zoe's house.
I was improvising.
wait, I thought watchers weren't supposed to
interfere. True.
and there was a reprimand involved, believe me.
apparently we're supposed to give warnings, clues, but not really affect the future ourselves, just influence others.
so you influenced a thief to steal the book.
why did you pick this particular thief?
it's not so hard to find these lost souls.
that, and he was about to break into my wife's house for the second time and I can't have that,
so, 2 birds, one stone kind of thing.
well, I'm sorry.
I don't know where the book is.
I do.
I'll tell you where the book is, but you have to promise me that you'll keep it safe.
and one other thing-- Melinda can't touch the book or even see it.
well, how am I supposed to do that?
I can't lie to Melinda.
if this stuff was easy, anybody could do it.
sorry to crash your party, but they're not gonna turn on me just because I'm a man, are they?
what are you doing here?
I've got some good news and bad news, and neither can wait.
OK, so what's the good news?
I found the book.
that's great.
what's the bad news?
what do you mean, I can't see the book?
or touch it, technically.
excuse me?
look, I don't know why, but Carl the reluctant watcher made me promise.
the thing is, I looked at the book last night cnd at its names,
and there was something really scary under Zoe's name.
but you can't show me?
no.
next best thing.
I scanned the page.
I figure you can read it without seeing the book.
Carl may not approve, but he doesn't seem like A letter of the law type of ghost.
what are these numbers?
no idea.
but look at this.
she helps the listener join the dead.
you're the listener?
Yeah!
what does that mean?
I'm marked for death or something?
we don't know that for sure.
that's why Zoe's not crossing over.
she knows I'm gonna die soon, and she's here to help me cross over.
Hey, Mel, there's still a couple more gifts to open.
OK.
please just stay calm, all right?
I'll only be a few minutes.
don't go awhere, I'm not going to let you out of my sight.
all right, here's the next one.
OK!
Oh, you guys, baby names!
that's great, 'cause we have no clue What the baby's name is going to be.
Where's the book?
in my office.
I need to see it right now!
but the watcher said-- Don't give me the watcher crap, all right?
just take me to the book or I'll hurt you.
who is sending you these messages?
I don't know.
the watchers, my unconscious...
they could be from the baby.
I don't even want to go there.
look, if my baby is in danger, I have to know it.
what?
I think I know what's going on here.
there are all dates, they're just backwards.
dates for what?
april 28th, a、Andrea died in that plane crash.
you were hurt in the fire october 3rd.
Jim died november 7th.
No!
and sam died november 14th, And zoe, may 15th.
what does it mean?
the book of changes.
this book isn't about the future, this book is about the past.
every one of these names is a normal person who died and came back in one way or another.
who's keeping track of it and why?
I don't know.
the watchers, maybe?
there's one more page you need to see.
it's probably why you weren't supposed to see the book.
september 25th.
what happened on that day?
this one is about the future.
what?
my due date.
september 25th.
Zoe, I have to talk to you.
please.
it's never been more important.
it's not about me or you.
it's about Melinda's baby.
she's scared.
you've got to tell me what you know.
tell Melinda the other side is giving her those visions to try to scare her.
they want the child to be scared, too.
the other side?
if I knew more, I would tell you, but there's so many things I haven't figured out yet.
you don't have to figure out anything anymore.
you can cross over.
no, I have to help you.
Zoe, the book says you help the listener join the dead.
but you already have.
how?
I did something stupid.
I let myself get involved with a patient.
I let it get too personal, Which led me right to being in that fire,
which led me directly to being able to hear the dead.
you did what you were meant to do.
there's more.
the book needs a caretaker.
it was me for all these years and I didn't even know it.
and now?
it's you.
but you can't keep the book in one place.
now that they know it's here, they'll never stop looking.
who?
they're different faces all the time, but they're always there.
Zoe, I'll take care of the book.
you're free now, Zoe.
you can cross over.
I don't feel right leaving you.
but you were right to leave me before.
and you're right now.
and you're leaving a lot of good behind.
I'm not.
I haven't had time to do anything...
to finish anything.
you're wrong.
look how you helped me.
you taught me how to care about somebody.
even if I was all awkward and stupid about it.
and you showed me that maybe somebody could care about me.
you know, in a way like I always wanted to be cared about but never thought I would.
that's kinda huge.
you gone?
but not forgotten.
are you here?
I really need to talk to you.
I didn't know where else to look.
I want some answers.
I know the feeling.
I understand now.
that it was Zoe who held my future in her hands because she knew what was in the book.
which you were not supposed to read.
so sue me.
look, I'm not asking for anything for myself, but I do need to know if my baby is in danger.
I am not supposed to tell you too much.
I've already had my wrists slapped.
you owe me, Carl.
when you were being haunted, I helped you find peace.
all I can tell you, Melinda, is that you have to prepare your child.
don't let the other side scare you into shielding him, but you must teach him.
there's a lot of white light around you.
many spirits watching over you.
more than you know, but one tear in the curtain, and the balance could shift.
and your son is the key.
will my son be able to do what I do?
no.
OK.
well, that's a relief.
he'll be able to do much, much more.
that takes care of the bridesmaids.
now, onto the orchestra samples.
take your time listening to them, but I need your choice by 7: 00.
now, can we talk about the ice sculpture?
imagine this 50 times as big.
excuse me.
can you come with me?
Hello?
Delia, you, too.
Hello? We're just trying to design the wedding of the decade here.
I haven't even spoken about the fireworks yet!
so what are we doing?
you know what?
Melinda, you were right.
no matter how big this wedding gets, In the end, it is still only about
you and me.
you recognize the street?
Yes.
it's the street where we first met.
you know, this wedding...
this marriage is just about us.
it's not about your mom, or, you know, our relatives or the ice sculpture.
it's just you and me.
the way it's always been.
well, I mean, almost the way it's always been.
but I've always been married to you, Melinda gordon.
no matter what comes between us, and I always will be.
no matter what's waiting for us.
and no matter what we can't foresee.
I promise you.
you're unbelievable.
this isn't a wedding.
this is just...
a renewal of what we have always had.
of what we'll never lose.
and you know why?
because you can't kill love.
Oh, hey, maid of honor.
best man.
let's do this.

so besides all that, how did you enjoy the play, mrs. lincoln?
you know, the irony is, i was enjoying it just fine.
I've been dating a lot of guys, and they're all turning out to be so dull.
Roger was kind of funny, he was smart, he was a little corny, in a good way.
and he listened.
you know how hard that is to find?
so, are you going to go out with him again?
you know, my mom always told me never to date a guy who was mean to waiters, so...
God, was he really that bad?
well, it's not like the maitre'd wasn't obnoxious, and it isn't the first time he ever spilled something on me.
I guess i should just wear a rain slicker when i go to lento's.
but roger, i don't know.
I saw this meanness underneath, so...
I think i'm just going to have to throw that one back.
see you later? - yep.
Thanks. bye. - bye.
you're kidding.
no, i wish i was.
I just had to sedate the attendant who now thinks the morgue is haunted.
well, can i come over and check it out?
no, the morgue's got back-to-back autopsies all day long.
so maybe tomorrow morning?
Yeah, after i put aiden on the bus.
maybe you could call eli. he might know something about it.
Eli's been sick all week. we're on our own.
let me try him at home.
all right. bye.
um...hello?
can i ask what you're doing?
is everything ready?
sorry?
is everything ready in the o. r?
patient is ready, doctor.
we have to find this ghost, mel. we only have a few minutes.
Hello? how can i help you?
you sound like customer service.
well, kind of is.
Oh, i feel something toxic here.
very dangerous.
what the...
back off yeah, you've got a haunted morgue here.
who wants to know?
my name is melinda gordon. i'd like to talk to you about what happened at rockland memorial.
are you 5-0?
I'm sorry, what now?
the po-po, the man, the heat.
I am not the police, if that's even remotely close to what you're asking me.
yo, then we got nothin' to talk about.
look, from what i heard, you pretty thrilled when the po-po showed up the other night as you were screaming your head off in the morgue.
I talk to ghosts.
I can see ghosts.
it's not something i want other people to know about, for obvious reasons.
but i am telling you because i want to know what happened the other night.
15 minutes, the alley behind the station.
Hey. i'm sorry to keep you waiting.
do you want to go somewhere more comfortable?
Oh, i know. the tough guy thing, it's just an act. it's my mask.
I don't get it.
survival. look, i just moved here to live with my grandfather.
at my old school, they all said i was this prodigy.
national honor society, science club, future mathematicians, blah, blah, blah.
you make it sound like a bad thing.
you know what it's like having an i. q. of 135?
no. - it's hell.
and all it ever got me was ignored by girls and my butt kicked by jocks.
there's no way i was going to be the new nerd in town.
so you make everybody believe that you're a thug?
semantics. - right.
I prefer to think of myself as a bad boy.
it's amazing, you know. it's all about perception.
everyone thinks i'm a bad ass from day one, and suddenly, it's like i'm untouchable.
what happened in the morgue?
it was an initiation.
not into the future mathematicians club, i take it?
I was supposed to stay in an empty morgue drawer for 15 minutes.
what happened? did you see something?
no, but i felt something.
someone touching me.
you know, at first i just thought it was like one of the guys hazing me or something.
did you hear anything?
other than my heartbeat? no.
so what if i need to talk to you again?
Oh, uh, just text me.
9-1-1, i'll meet you here.
OK.
is everything ready in the o. r?
patient is prepared and ready, doctor.
we are going to fix you up, son.
they're killing me!
roses are red and violets are blue ooh! i love this! do you know who's doing it?
Yes.
Roger "i seem nice but i'm really mean" shephard.
he's called me a few times, but i'm not calling him back.
all right, so he's on a mission. he wants to win you over.
Yeah, not gonna happen.
famous last words.
so, is there any news about all the weirdness happening at the morgue?
she said, changing the subject.
how do you know about the morgue?
are you kidding? it's all over town.
people are saying that dead bodies are coming to life.
no. these bodies are dead. the ghost is just manipulating them.
Oh. well, that ought to make people feel better.
now what are the grown-ups at the hospital saying?
Oh, well, it's explainable. i mean, muscle spasms, rigor mortis, blah, blah, blah.
how do you deal with a haunting like this?
ineptly, so far. and i keep getting distracted by all these visions i'm getting from aiden.
he keeps having weird surgery nightmares.
how do you know that they're his?
it's been happening a lot lately. getting used to it.
Oh, poor kid.
no, it's fine.
he doesn't remember any of them. i get them loud and clear.
same one, same time every night.
man, you have got so much on your plate.
and i'm sorry, but i have to go.
are you sure you don't want to give roger a second chance?
a lot of fish in the sea, and all that.
but it proves he has a romantic side!
and besides, you told me that that maitre'd was obnoxious and had spilled things on you before, so maybe roger was just, i don't know, protecting you.
OK, i admit it, the violets were impressive.
but they're not a get out of jail card.
eli...there's no easy way to break this to you, so i'm just going to give it to you straight.
you don't have swine flu.
you have laryngitis.
flesh eating Bacteria?
no, and you don't have flesh eating bacteria, either.
it's probably just hives.
you had hives all over your rear end through the whole fourth grade.
Eli, what is all this stuff?
define regular.
this is what i call clean.
I am not hungry.
typical morning conversation with mom.
I'm just trying to take care of you.
did i just walk into the middle of family feud?
A. you're smothering me.
B. suggestions about...
more fiber, inappropriate.
and c.i just want privacy.
you want privacy?
you got it.
I know when i'm not wanted.
Eli, just take 2 aspirin or whatever's your poison and
be grateful i believe in house calls.
I can't change it, he's gone. i
what?
I killed him. i
I killed him!
murderous ghost attached to this instrument, big time.
what, you've had two hauntings from this surgeon ghost.
why didn't you tell me there was a spirit attached to this thing?
I didn't know. i thought the visions that i was having were aiden's dreams, and he was sending them to me.
sorry. a guy just likes to know who's in his house, especially if they're dead.
do you have a date or something?
well, kind of. just stay with me.
so what's the deal with this ghost?
well, if he's attached to the instrument, then it's an imprint haunting.
Oh, not a ghost loop. we've been through that, right?
Yeah, exactly. where a ghost gets stuck reliving a traumatic event over and over again until he can figure out how to make it right.
traumatic is an understatement.
look, how can i help? can you tell me what kind of surgery this ghost is performing?
actually, i can do better than tell you.
I can watch it.
what do you see?
everything's pretty old.
it's a long time ago.
can you guess a date?
1950s.
there's a big machine in the corner. lots of tubes.
is there anything written on it? what does it say?
it says "oxygenator.
Oh, it's a heart-lung machine, wow.
and if it's the fifties, that's one of the first of its kind.
patient off heart-lung.
they just took him off the machine.
they're operating on his chest.
all right, if that's open heart surgery, there's only a few procedures they could have done at that time.
he's in cardiac arrest.
doctor, his heart stopped.
wait, wait! - do something!
doctor, do something! we're losing him!
no, please! wait, my patient!
do something! - this can't be!
get him outside.
we're losing him.
keep trying.
he's gone.
well, keep trying, keep trying.
now what is it?
something went wrong.
the doctor made a mistake and the patient died on the table.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
what is it? what's wrong?
Hey, did we wake you up?
I feel like...
like what, baby?
like i did something wrong.
like i did something bad to somebody.
I didn't mean it.
you didn't do anything wrong.
it was just a bad dream.
well, it explains why aiden's been feeling like he's done something wrong.
you know, it's not his dreams. it's the presence of this ghost.
a ghost that accidentally killed one of his patients during surgery over 50 years ago?
there was a lot of confusion.
he was very upset, and they had to take him out of the o. r.
think there's any connection between your surgery ghost and my morgue ghost?
what if the morgue ghost was the patient who was killed?
I mean, think about it, you know? all these hauntings started the day you found that instrument.
Yeah, i guess that makes as much sense as anything else.
hmm. not really sure how to take that.
uh, with a little dose of irony, my dear.
I thought so.
So...how are we going to find out more?
get out of here. everybody out. clear the morgue.
can you see that? go, go.
Oh, this ghost is getting on my nerves.
your nerves? my heartbeat's still at warp speed.
did you get the ghost surgeon's name?
Ah, yeah. it's dr. albert glassman.
the guy ran cardiology. but get this
he died the same day that the patient he was operating died, october 16th, 1959.
I don't get it. how can that be?
I don't know. i mean, sometimes the paperwork can get messed up and the dates can get confused, but...
OK, well, did you get the patient's name who died on the table?
no. not that, either. i had one more page to go when the screaming started.
well, look, i mean if the morgue ghost is the patient that dr. glassman killed during surgery, we have to get those two together. because then the morgue ghost can forgive dr. glassman, dr. glassman can stop reliving the same mistake over and over again, and hopefully, at some point, we can get a good night's sleep.
what?
why is there a mime following delia?
Oh! please go away.
I'm begging you.
OK. thank you so much.
I've got it. bye-bye now.
I'm gonna read it.
Oh, sweet. very sweet, ok.
OK.
roses red, violets are blue, i can't hide my feelings.
OK. i'm gonna go now, and i wish you would stop that, 'cause you're kinda creeping me out.
OK, please. would you please stop? just stop crying.
stop crying. would you please stop crying?
I'm sorry i hurt your feelings
Seriously?
you want a tip. ok.
there's your tip. thanks so much.
you're very, uh...talented.
Taxi!
I know who you are.
you're a patient of dr. albert glassman.
you had a congenital heart defect.
he was trying to repair it.
you died in surgery.
look, i know that you're angry.
and just so you know, dr. glassman is very upset, too, but you're both stuck here.
earthbound because of your anger and...
his guilt.
it's time to end it.
what's your name?
you know me.
I've seen you, but i don't know your name.
I can feel your anger.
you want revenge.
what happened to you was terrible...
and it was just an accident.
what happened to me, what happened to everybody here, was no accident.
I don't know who you are, or if you even know what's going on.
but what's about to happen was an accident.
and you're going to feel angry, like you want revenge, but please, just cross over and find some peace.
I'm so sorry that i don't know your name.
sorry to pull you away from all the grandview unrulies, but i have a very important question.
speak.
do you know if you're related to a william jett?
what's it to you?
sorry. i mean, why do you ask?
sometimes, in the spirit world, a ghost can be earth-bound but dormant.
I think when you broke into the morgue that you stirred up the ghost of your relative, william jett.
the ghost of william jett?
he's been haunting the hospital. he's still angry with the surgeon he thinks caused his death all those years ago.
look, no judgment, but whatever you're on, there is help available.
OK, i know it's a lot to take in, but i really need you to reach out to your relative and see if you can get him to forgive the surgeon he blames for his death.
now, how are you related to william jett?
bill jett. that's my grandfather.
wait a minute, how can he be your grandfather?
he died in 1959, and he was only a teenager.
dude, my grandfather is a lot of things, but dead is not one of them.
he just ran the senior triathlon.
he's alive and well and totally disgusted with my newfound street cred.
Yeah, it's just me and my grandfather. can't wait for you to meet him.
Paul! - grandpa.
Hey. - this is melinda gordon.
Hi. - she thinks you're dead.
well, if you're the welcoming committee, that's fine.
please, bear with me.
aren't you the william jett who had heart surgery in 1959?
true. on my 16th birthday, no less. - but you didn't
I saw it
I thought that the doctor made a mistake, and that you died on the table.
Dr. glassman didn't kill me.
I killed him.
most people don't accept it so easily when i say i can see ghosts.
are you kidding? i think it's a great gift.
Yeah, but you were wrong this time.
don't be rude, gangsta.
can one of your ghosts help me understand why my grandson thinks its cooler to hang with a group of monosyllabic morons than use the brain he was blessed with?
now don't diss me, pa-pa.
no idea.
could you tell me what happened during the operation?
well...the fact is, i did die for a few minutes.
he's in cardiac arrest!
it was amazing. - doctor!
his heart stopped! - i could see and hear everything, and nobody could see me.
do something! we're losing him!
no, please!
Dr. glassman looked so stricken, so panicky.
I wanted to tell him i was fine.
heh, in fact, i never felt better.
leave me alone, leave me alone.
then i could see the doctor was in trouble.
there was something wrong with him.
I tried calling to him, to the other doctors, but of course, no one could hear me.
the poor man had a heart attack in the hospital hallway, and died within seconds.
he's back!
they were able to bring me back.
I was dead for three full minutes, so they told me.
for me, it seemed like a split second.
Tracy call dr. . - or maybe a lifetime.
I decided that day i'd never waste another second.
learn everything i could, go everywhere i could. teach.
live a full life.
but...I almost felt guilty.
I had a second chance at life, and dr. glassman lost his.
I thought if only he'd known i could be revived, maybe he wouldn't have had his heart attack.
how come you never told me this?
past has a way of slowing you down. who needs it?
well, sometimes, the past can teach us.
did they ever find out what happened?
did dr. glassman make a mistake?
I don't think they ever fully understood why i went into arrest, but, uh, cardiac surgery was in its infancy.
but i'll tell you one thing for sure
Dr. glassman fixed the hole in my heart.
I'm alive today because of what he did.
looks like you had a great life.
still having it.
would you mind waiting here for me?
I'll be right back. it's important.
so there you go. - thank you.
Hey. i'll have a double latte.
Hey, delia, someone just left this for you.
Really?
I'll be right back.
Hey.
Oh! hi.
Hi.
I see you got the gift.
Yes.
look, um...
I can't say what happened at lento's still doesn't bother me a little bit, and i'm not really big on second chances, but at the end of the day, anyone this persistent deserves a second chance.
you lost me at persistent.
what? i
I don't know what you mean.
the gifts, the notes, the, um, the mime?
mimes creep me out.
Oh. so, um...
you didn't do any of that stuff?
well, no. i mean...
you didn't return my calls, i got the message. you know.
I moved on.
Oh, i just noticed there was a box in there with your name on it when i was picking up my coffee just now, so...
well, uh, i gotta run.
take care.
Yeah. you, too.
roses are red, violets are blue, "i can't hide my feelings, that's why i keep spilling things on you.
you?
it is just that since the first time i saw you, and for months now, every time i try to talk to you, or do something to impress you, i-i get nervous.
so i mess it all up.
you were on the rooftop with the flowers?
I know. i must come across like a total buffalo.
a buffoon?
Yes. yes, thank you, a buffoon.
and if i had to do it all over, i would definitely rethink the mime.
I have to keep trying with you.
because the truth is, whenever i see you smile, it makes me forget whatever i'm saying.
whatever i'm thinking.
even what i'm doing.
how can i ignore this?
if i use this to bring him here, it might break him out of his ghost loop.
what are we doing?
you're about to meet dr. glassman.
Dr. glassman: suction, where's the suction?
he's here.
who are you?
Where's my patient?
this is your patient.
he survived the operation. you didn't cause his death.
no.
this isn't my patient.
no, that's his grandson.
this is your patient.
no.
my patient is just a boy.
Yes.
he was 50 years ago.
but he survived.
and he's right here.
you've been stuck here this whole time trying to make it right.
no, i killed him. i made a mistake.
he's saying that he killed you.
Oh, no, doc. can he hear me?
no, doc, you saved me.
but you had a heart attack and died before you knew.
that's right, i died.
and i died a failure.
I couldn't figure out what i did wrong.
Dr. glassman, i died for a few minutes, but they were able to restart my heart, the heart you fixed.
I lived.
you didn't kill him.
you saved him.
I saved him?
Yes.
look at these pictures.
his family, his kids, his...brilliant grandson.
look at all the accomplishments he had as a teacher.
look at all the accomplishments of his students.
look at all the love and the joy in these pictures.
look at all the things that are in the world because bill jett is in the world.
because you held his heart in your hands and you fixed it.
he's not wasted one minute.
you gave him a second chance.
and by giving him that second chance, you've given everybody else in his life a first chance.
doctor, you have no reason to feel guilty.
I'm the one who feels bad.
because of what happened to me, you had a heart attack.
no, no, it wasn't your fault.
my heart was in bad shape, it was just a matter of time.
he doesn't want you to feel guilty.
his heart was in bad shape.
so he can hear me, right?
Yes.
I just want to say...
Thanks.
thanks for giving me my grandfather.
I never realized how lucky i was to come from him.
he seems like a nice kid.
why is he dressed like a thug?
Oh, it's a long story.
he's crossing over now.
he's gone.
I love you, grandpa.
good morning.
what?
we thought bill jett was the ghost who was haunting the morgue.
but he's not.
so who is?
Dr. Bedford: I need your help.
you've got to find that book.
the shadows. what kinds of shadows are those?
the ones they make from the parts that get left behind.
parts of what? People.
broken people.
the shadows? They actually want something?
well, whatever it is, they're scary enough.
that the book decided to rewrite itself,
to erase any mention of them.
Bedford knew about that book, then?
I'm sure the shadows did.
Bedford's president now.
he'd have total control over it.
your staff has no clue where you are.
you could ask my mother if she weren't comatose.
I visit her every day since the liver failure.
leave her alone.
I won't let you hurt her.
I will do whatever it takes,
do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
let me know if you have any questions.
Mm - hmm.
Wow.
this is not the usual genteel stuff you normally carry.
true, but there seems to be an interest in all things military right now,
and I found this collector who has tons.
well, now you truly have the "a" to "z" shopping experience.
you have antique needlepoint pillows,
you've got art deco lamps, and look,
you've got world War II gun holsters.
you know what, maybe it'll bring in more male customers.
well, have you ever considered having,
a vintage wet t-shirt contest?
cause that'll really bring them in.
times are tough, I just might.
Yeah, I know. Speaking of tough times,
I have an open house over on shore road.
Ooh, can I borrow these chimes?
this would be a nice touch out on the front porch.
that house still hasn't sold?
listen, I am on my way over there right now,
to make cookies in the kitchen.
I will try anything I can right now. Anything?
cause I have some vintage tees.
very funny.
OK, thank you so much.
I'll see you later! bye! bye.
good luck.
good luck.
are you all right?!
Yes, I think so.
Ah, I'm so sorry!
well, what happened?
I don't know. I just kind of fainted,
I guess.
well, did you hit your head or anything?
no, I don't think.
I'm so embarrassed.
please, don't be. Let me just get you some water.
I just felt so light-headed all of a sudden.
it's never happened to me before.
look, my husband, he's a doctor.
at the hospital right there.
we could just go...
Oh, no, no, thank you.
I'm really fine.
I just-- maybe I haven't eaten enough today.
I'm so sorry about your vase.
let me pay for it.
please, you know what, I hated that vase anyway.
you did me a favor.
you sure? Yeah.
can I get you a cab?
uh, no, I think walking will be good for me.
I just gotta shake this weird feeling.
thanks again, so much.
no problem. Look, just promise me
that if you don't feel better right away,
you'll go see a doctor.
that's a promise. Thanks again.
I'll walk you out.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
I swear I already filed this...
Ecology..
you know what they say about people who talk to themselves.
Yes. But it's only dangerous when you start answering yourself.
can I help you, President Bedford?
Yes, I want to give you,
the curriculum guidelines for the next semester.
that's it?
that's what you came here for?
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
I didn't do it.
I'm trying to figure out who did.
I don't follow. I feel like somebody
is actually going through my stuff.
well, perhaps you should file a theft report with campus security.
Yeah, see, that's the weird part.
there's actually nothing missing.
there's just stuff moved around.
it's not where I left any of it.
how could you tell?
it's like someone's looking for something.
something that doesn't belong to them.
you making an accusation?
because again, campus security would be your best bet.
you know what I'm talking about.
do you really think I'm that stupid,
that I'd leave "the book of changes" in my office?
well, what I think of your stupidity isn't important.
now what is important is that I tried to warn you what you're up against.
now I am the least of your problems, Eli.
he was loved and he died too young.
even so,
he had a big impact on a lot of lives.
giovanni was the best turtle in the world.
you ok?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about Giovanni.
I know the two of you were close.
he was a good listener.
you know, I never asked you
why you decided to name your turtle Giovanni.
because if he could talk,
I think he'd have an italian accent.
that makes perfect sense.
I love you. See you in the morning.
I don't think he's really dead.
what?
Giovanni. He's not really dead.
what makes you say that?
cause I remember him so good.
and all the fun stuff we did.
I bet he remembers me, too.
wherever he is.
Yeah.
I bet he does.
so he's not really dead.
you're a very wise little man.
no, I'm just thirsty.
OK.
I'll get you somemeater, then.
maybe I should call you Francis.
Hey, how did the open house go?
only 3 people showed. But the cookies were a hit, though.
and not one offer?
well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
some lady offered me $25 for the chimes.
Aha.
what are you doing?
I am not really sure.
well, I like your honesty.
sorry, I think there's a spirit attached
to one of the things in this collection.
maybe killed in combat.
Really?
Yeah, and getting blown up every night,
is going to get old real quick.
I'm sorry, what now?
long story.
I think you just hit a nerve.
do you see anybody?
no.
but I think i'm going to have to go back to the source.
OK. Um...
I'm gonna go.
I have stuff to do.
um, I'll see you later.
Bye.
no returns, all sales are final.
uh, I'm not returning anything.
do you remember me?
Whoa! Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
don't get a lot of customers that look like you.
it's actually not what I came to ask you,
but now I'm curious,
is Mastersargeant really your last name?
no. No, it's Masters.
I added the "argeant."
I was actually going to put "at arms" in there,
but the sign wouldn't fit it.
you know that "sergeant" is spelled with an "e," right?
it is -- yeah, I know.
sar-- sar-- yeah, yeah, I know. What's your point?
have you ever actually been in the military, George?
ha, yes!
spiritually.
um, and what about physically?
not so much, no.
I had a little problem passing the physical.
OK, look, the collection that I got from you,
I need to know where it came from.
and why?
just need to know.
it's hard to say.
OK, well, is there paperwork or anything?
because I kinda need to know who the owner is.
I buy this stuff from all over the place,
you know, auctions, flea markets.
all kinds of places.
right, I do the same thing with antiques,
except usually I have bills,
receipts, contact information.
Yeah, well, you know, my customers are not exactly
sticklers for paperwork and stuff, so...
anyway, it's all legal, it's all above board.
right, so there should be a way, then, for you to
Yeah, you know what, I got an army-navy store up in flushing,
and they're kind of expecting a shipment here.
well, can you just-- anyway, listen, oh!
next week, I've got a sale on barbed wire.
ha, you know, you ought to invite your friends, ok?
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid!
I've got to save my men, I'm not afraid!
everybody down!
I'll go first!
Oh, no!
it has to be the ghost of a soldier who died in an explosion.
he's attached to the mess kit I bought.
you know, someone should invent a scanner,
that not only tells you the price of what you're buying,
but whether or not there's a ghost attached to it.
it would save everybody a lot of trouble.
you know what, why did he sound like a little boy?
I don't know.
I think Bedford's going through my office looking for the book.
please tell me that that book is not in your office.
do you think I'm an idiot?
the book is hidden here, where no one can find it.
Oh, well, that's good.
Yeah, the bad news is,
I hid it so well, I couldn't find it, either.
but then I found it.
OK, so let's go back to the other question.
Oh, well, perfect timing.
Ned, what are you doing here? It's my turn.
Ned and I have been taking turns holding on to the book,
so it's never in one place for too long.
that's a good idea.
Yeah, it was Ned's idea.
I'm not surprised.
pretty smart, huh?
I came for the book, not for dinner.
it's not like I can label it.
interesting.
it looks like the book added some stuff.
nothing I understand,
but there's definitely more here than the last time.
so where are you going to hide it?
I think we should stick to the rule
of not telling each other. It's safer that way.
I just showed you my hiding place!
well, get a new one. Easy for you to say!
OK, guys, I have a ghost to cross over.
Oh, right, so haunted mess kit.
Where'd it come from?
well, that's the thing.
I went to this dealer I've never dealt with before,
and when I went back to ask him about it,
he got weird.
you know, like he was hiding something.
so here's what you do?
place an order with him for the same type of stuff.
promise him a big pay day, then follow him.
see where he goes to get it.
OK. I'm impressed again.
you're too close.
no, I'm not. Yuh-huh.
he can see the headlights in his mirror.
that doesn't mean that he knows we're following him.
just back off a little, will you? Trust me.
I watch TV.
where is he taking us?
I don't know. I've never been on these roads.
hmm.
maybe he's seen us following him,
and he's luring us to our deaths,
and no one will ever find our bodies.
just saying.
you think he went in here?
well, if I'd been able to follow closer,
maybe I would know. Now, come on.
what is this place?
well, I've heard about it.
it was an old army base,
and then they started shutting them down to save money.
it was the first to go.
right, I read something about this.
weren't they supposed to build some houses out here or something?
Yeah, well, nothing ever happened.
sad to see it so deserted.
uh, it's not exactly deserted.
Oh, great, it's not creepy enough out here,
now we have to have the lost patrol with us, too?
have you seen the medic? we need the medic.
I'm sorry, I just got here.
would you please tell him to get to the tent right away?
he's needed.
will do.
is there any reason why we can't pick this up in the morning,
when the sun is shining?
look.
Oh, god! You scared me!
wait a minute, what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
me? I, uh.
you're robbing stuff, that's what you're doing here!
that's where you get your inventory from?
you just steal it from the base?
OK, first of all, I'm not stealing, ok?
it was abandoned, it's just rusting here.
I'm providing a service!
uh, which you make money from.
Yeah, so what? You know, I do all the legwork.
nobody even knows about this place.
and I found it!
all right, George, that doesn't even matter.
just drop the stuff, ok?
and don't come back.
does that mean our deal is off?
what do you think?
well, how about we go halfsies? Cash and carry.
good-bye. Oh, god, you suck!
that is so wrong!
now what?
I don't know. I mean, I guess my ghost soldier was here, but...
Hey! Wait! What?
what? I just saw a ghost!
no kidding. No, no, no!
it was a boy, not a soldier!
he must know something, come on!
so I made the assumption
that the ghost soldier had to have been
a part of the base at some point.
hasn't the base been closed for almost 20 years?
more like 30.
I found out it closed in the late seventies.
but the soldier that I saw in the basement,
he -- he was a modern day soldier.
OK, what about the ghost kid you saw?
how does he fit in? Wish I knew.
I mean, why would an 11 or 12-year old boy
be haunting an army base?
do you think he has something to do with the ghost soldier?
there has to be some kind of connection.
why would the ghost soldier open his mouth,
and a little boy's voice come out?
what?
Wow.
it must be really, really interesting to be you.
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid.
I've got to protect my men.
everybody down, I'll go first.
I gotta save my men. I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
what happened to you?
Mel, come eat something.
you know that will always be there.
I'm just trying to see if I can find a connection
between the thing that blew up in my vision
and the little bomb thing the ghost boy showed me.
you know, I wish people could overhear
the conversations we have in this house.
I just can't get that kid's face out of my head.
he was so scared; so...vulnerable.
he...
what?
his eyes reminded me of Aiden.
Hey, hey, shh, shh, shh.
here it is.
that's a mine.
um, Vietnam era, maybe?
Yeah, there's the foot plate thingy that I stepped on,
and that is what the boy showed me.
you said the soldier was modern, not from Vietnam.
Ah, which leads to my theory,
and it's a brilliant one, if I do say so myself.
the boy was playing on an abandoned base.
he wasn't supposed to be there, right, 'cause he snuck in, that's what boys do.
that's right. Right.
so he finds this cool thing that looks like fun,
but he doesn't realize it's still a live bomb.
he plays with it, it goes off.
hmm. Ok.
wait, no, that still doesn't explain the soldier with the little kid's voice, though.
well, maybe it does.
I mean, sometimes spirits recreate
the last thing they were doing before they died
so the kid was playing soldier.
right. He's confused.
he's scared, so his spirit
is sometimes rejecting himself,
as the thing he was making believe he was when he died.
a soldier in combat.
amazing. Now come eat.
the only problem with this theory
is that the ghost kid I saw did not look like he had been in a bomb blast.
that doesn't make any difference.
you know, the shockwave from a bomb
can ruin your organs, kill you,
keep your body completely intact.
have you checked on Aiden?
he's fine. He's in his room,
playing with his fire trucks.
OK.
I just have to check now and see if there's any news reports
about explosions or anything else.
Delia. Hey.
what's the matter?
Hey. Did you say that ghost kid you saw
was a boy around 12 years old?
Yeah.
I found this on my car tonight.
he went missing 2 days ago.
that's the same time that the haunting started.
Ah, that poor family.
I gotta find this kid.
see if I can get his family some closure.
um, I just -- I'm so glad to officially be talking to somebody
who's connected to the base.
Yeah, well, we still keep an eye on the place.
there's no real staff here anymore,
but I rotate in every couple of weeks.
so the army still owns the base?
Yeah, technically we still own this property.
I mean, although it's been up for sale ever since I can remember.
what about bombs?
excuse me?
are there bombs stored here?
mines, grenades, that kind of thing?
well, uh... look,
I think a little boy was killed by one.
it's very important.
there is still some unexploded ordnance
on this base, and it's a bit
of an embarrassment to the army.
and I will deny it if you tell anyone.
I told you that.
um, sir, before you go...
Ooh!
can you show me where it is? Show you what?
it's over in the storage barracks,
but you'll both need official clearance to tour the base.
Oh. Didn't know you had company.
come on.
why do you think the door was unlocked?
whoa.
I think the kid came in here.
there's no sign of an explosion here.
and this stuff must all be defused.
there's no way they'd leave live bombs like this
just laying out in the open.
Eli, don't touch that!
OK, the ghost said that there's unexploded ordnance.
that doesn't mean they're live.
relax.
even if they're not defused,
these bombs are so old, they're not dangerous anymore.
how do you know that?
Melinda, I do have a life outside the classroom, ok?
watch this.
Oh! Hypothesis gone wrong!
it happens.
what?
the last time that I saw the ghost,
the little boy,
he was crammed into something small.
and looks like he couldn't move.
you don't think that...
looks like the poor kid got himself
locked in that container and suffocated.
so why am I always finding you two in the middle of trouble?
what has this got to do with you?
we had good reason to believe that the boy's body was here.
what kind of reason?
you know what kind of reason.
you should have called us first.
and said what? The ghost gave us clues?
we'll talk later.
detective Simon: So you and Ms. Gordon came up here together, right?
that's right.
Uh-huh. Ok.
that's it for now, Dr. James,
but we may want to talk to you later.
he doesn't like me.
I can tell.
now I can get closure for the family.
I just have to find that poor kid
and get him to cross over.
now that's interesting.
Yeah. What's the connection
between Bedford and the base?
Bedford and the boy?
I'll be right back. Ok.
I remember you.
sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.
did you know Joey?
it kind of feels like I did.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
that day that I was in your store,
that was the day that Joey went missing.
I didn't know it yet, I thought he was in school.
I can't imagine how hard this must be.
I think I fainted because somehow I knew,
deep down, that Joey was in trouble.
you were very kind to me that day.
it looked like he had a lot of friends.
he did.
everyone liked him.
he changed, though, these past few months.
he started playing hooky from school.
I didn't know where he was sometimes.
he made me so worried.
but he would always show up back in his room.
did you know about the army base?
no, he never told me where he went.
now it all makes sense.
do you know why he went to the army base?
Yes.
excuse me, Julie. Hi. I'm dennis.
sorry to interrupt, but it's time to go.
you ok? Mm-hmm.
you sure?
Yeah, I'm fine.
yes?
Hello, son.
mother?!
is that really you?
you're -- you're out of the coma.
...what you need done.
I can't hear you.
you have what you need.
what...
what?
to get this done.
you have what you need.
mother, I can't!
you have to!
do what they want,
so you can protect the rest of your family.
you don't know what they're asking.
who got to you?
you have to make the book
come to you!
there's no choice!
mother, listen to me.
listen to me!
mother...
Mr. Bedford, Mr. Bedford?
please listen to me!
this is Dr. Masefield from Rockland Memorial.
I'm very sorry to tell you
that your mother passed away.
when?
about 30 minutes ago.
we tried your office number.
we did everything we could.
she never regained consciousness.
I'm sorry.
look, I know you must feel so confused.
I saw your mom today.
she misses you, but she's ok.
I could take you to her if you want,
you know, if you have anything you want to say.
dad?
it's me.
I'm not your dad.
why are you looking for your dad here?
I...I just saw him, with your mom.
Dennis? That's not my father.
he's my uncle.
my dad died in Afghanistan.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
he died a hero.
I'm sure he's very brave.
he stepped on a mine.
but he totally saved his whole platoon.
you must be proud, but why are you looking for him at this base?
my dad used to bring me here, before he went away.
only me and him knew about it.
we would play army.
he'd tell me stories about being a soldier.
you're going to be a war hero like your old man.
come on.
where are you going, huh?
can you touch that?
sometimes we would even camp out,
and eat out of mess kits like real soldiers.
what do you think of being a soldier?
I want to be a soldier, just like you.
you'd make a great soldier. You'd have to cut your hair, though.
when he died, I still liked to come here.
made me feel like I was...
like I was still with him.
do you remember what happened to you?
I found all these bombs.
on the mines,
just like the one that killed my dad.
I figured that something like this
was probably the last thing my dad ever saw.
I just wanted to take it home with me.
then I heard noises.
someone was coming.
I just wanted to find some place to hide.
Dr. Bedford: leave me alone, please, just leave me alone.
there was a man, came in, he was whispering.
what do you want from me?
I've done everything you've asked.
all right, all right, I'll get it.
at first I thought he was with someone, but I was scared.
I've -- I've done everything you wanted.
then something startled him and he bumped into the door.
who's there? Get away from me.
all right, all right.
I'll do it.
I couldn't get the door open.
I kept trying and trying.
then it got real hard to breathe.
and then I just got tired and fell asleep.
someone came and took a bomb?
so there's a live bomb out there?
what did this man look like?
I only got a quick look at him,
but he had white hair and glasses.
was this the man?
that's him.
what is Bedford doing with a bomb?
now. If I could just speak to detective Blair for one second.
you have something to say, you can say it to me.
it's not like I wouldn't love to,
but detective Blair has a certain understanding for our situation.
detective Blair has been transferred.
she's no longer at this precinct.
I'm handling her cases now.
where was she transferred to?
why was she transferred?
the department didn't consult you?
look, I know this is going to sound weird,
but the president of Rockland University
has a live bomb.
what?
it's a mine, actually,
but it's dangerous, and he knows it.
you're saying that the president of Rockland University
has a bomb that he's planning to use?
do you have evidence?
define evidence.
OK, you can't be throwing a word like "bomb" around this day and age.
look, you don't know me, ok? But I'm not crazy.
Bedford has a bomb!
and he wouldn't have gone to the trouble of getting it
if he didn't have a plan to use it.
I think he's unstable.
Where'd he get the bomb? From the old army base.
we cleaned that place out after they found the boy's body.
took it before that.
OK.
we happen to know that a bomb is missing,
we got the inventory from the army, we're handling it.
great! Then why aren't you on the way to Bedford's?
because this guy here has been arrested
for stealing government property. Mm - hmm.
we found him there pocketing everything that wasn't nailed down to the base,
so we're going to get a search warrant,
we're going to go through his house.
as soon as we do,
we're going to find that bomb.
so the police wouldn't help us.
no, and it gets worse.
Bedford hasn't been in his office all day.
he went on bereavement leave yesterday.
his mother died.
well, was she sick for a long time?
maybe that's why he's been so weird.
it doesn't explain why he took a bomb.
look, maybe we're the ones who are overreacting.
OK, the guy could collect military memorabilia,
and then have heard about the hidden bombs at the base.
Oh, come on. You don't believe that any more than I do.
no. Something's up with him.
last time he came into my office,
he was acting all weird and mysterious.
even more weird and mysterious than he usually does.
Hey. What are you doing here?
it's your turn to hide it.
Yeah, I don't think right now
is a good time for me to.
Dr. James.
Hello, hello?
I know that Melinda's with you now,
and that Ned's on his way, if he's not there already.
it's Bedford.
now I'm going to ask you one last time, nicely.
I want the book.
Yeah, well, you never asked for it, technically.
Eli, I'm warning you!
I don't know where it is.
look, I...
I don't think you appreciate
the gravity of this situation.
now, I know all about your little hand-off system.
now I am tired of chasing the book.
I want you to bring it here now.
Yeah, right.
you don't know what I've been through.
the shadows have turned my life inside out.
took my mother away from me.
I'm not going to shoulder this burden alone anymore.
you don't want me to drop what I have in my hand.
you're going to bring me the book now.
now I've got nothing left to lose,
and if this thing goes off,
I don't care what happens to me,
but I would hate to see it take away someone
who is very precious to you.
and if I see one police officer
or any sign that you're not doing,
exactly as I say, it'll be all over.
I hate to rush you, but...
Yeah, I happen to have ned on the line.
he had a question about class next semester.
he's a go - getter, your boy.
do you want to say hi?
hi -- hi, Ned.
if you hurt my mom, I swear to god.
Yes, ok, well,
you bring the paperwork to your mom's office,
quickly, while we're all still here.
damn it!
so is this house yours that you're selling?
no, it's my mother's.
she passed away recently.
Oh, I'm sorry. I know how painful that is.
Yes, it is.
um, why don't i just fill out some of this basic information, and
uh - huh.
I'm sure you realize how difficult it is
to sell a house right now?
Yes, but I don't think that's going to matter too much.
no, not too much.
I should do it.
she's my mom, and he's expecting me.
no. no way. Your mother would never forgive us
if we let you anywhere near that bomb, ok?
I'll bring it right back out.
Mel, is this worth anybody's life?
all right.
wait.
I should do it.
I know Bedford and he knows me.
technically, it's my turn to have the book, so...
I wouldn't mind a little protest.
I mean, I'm open to objections here.
hurry.
I guess that'll do.
well, why don't you just come over here
and you can fill everything out.
here. Just take that.
heh... is everything ok?
Ah... I don't know.
it's not supposed to be him!
keep very still now. What is that?
very still.
Eli, what is going on?
I have what you want. Now let her go.
Eli, what the hell is going on?
Delia, please.
now, I'm going to hand you the book...
as soon as Delia steps out, ok?
OK.
just walk towards the door.
Delia, please.
OK, ok.
Eli, come with me.
Delia, it's all right, just go. Just go.
Delia! Look out.
Delia, Delia, come over here, it's all right.
Hey!
Ned! Mom!
I'm sorry, Eli.
I know things have gotten
a little out of hand,
but I tried to do what I think is right.
look, it's not too late.
just come outside with me. Put that bomb down.
we'll get this all straightened out.
hmm. I'm afraid it's too late.
there are too many moving parts.
they're powerful.
more than anybody knows.
I was hoping that you'd say we would walk out together and end this.
I'm going to have to ask you
to give me the book now, and leave.
it doesn't have to end this way.
even for you.
Yes, it does.
no, no, this can't be.
these pages are all gone!
it's gone, the pages are all gone!
No!
I did everything you asked, everything!
it's not my fault!
what, what
No!
the book erased itself!
you can't blame me for that!
Eli, hurry!
No!
Ned, are you ok?!
Yeah.
Eli... yeah, I just...
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
I'm ok, honey. Are you hurt? I'm fine.
it's all right.
I want to thank you for your help.
what did I do?
well, you let us know that there was danger
and who was responsible.
it's time for you to go now.
you must know that.
look, I can promise you that your dad is going to be waiting for you
on the other side of that light.
I know.
so then why don't you want to cross over?
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to be dead.
well...
then I'm just going to have to tell you something.
something that I learned just a few days ago.
you're not dead.
as a matter of fact, nobody ever dies.
you want to know why?
because you're gonna...
you're gonna live inside everybody who ever knew you.
everyone you ever touched.
no matter how little.
and...The people who love you -- your mom,
your uncle Dennis, your friends at school,
they're never going to stop thinking about you.
or talking about you.
they're never going to forget you, 'cause that never goes away.
you're never going to die because you were loved.
because you loved.
you're gonna live forever.
we all will.
do you see the light?
good - bye, Joey.
I'll see you again someday.
what?
I thought I was going to lose you.
just for a second.
not a chance.
do your homework.
ghosts don't get hurt.
my mom says they can't feel pain.
she's wrong. We do.
I can still see everything,
all the bad stuff!
the shadows are breaking up!
whatever they are, wherever they live,
these shadows are very interested in ghost children.
the shadows, they actually want something?
whatever it is, they're scary enough.
that the book decided to rewrite itselff to erase any mention of them.
now I'm going to ask you one last time nicely.
Ned, you're going to bring me the book now.
if this thing goes off,
I would hate to see it take away someone who is very precious to you.
it doesn't have to end this way.
Yes, it does.
it's gone, they're gone!
the pages are all gone!
No!
Eli, hurry!
while they're rebuilding your office,
everything you need is right here...
copier, wireless, phone, coffee, and best friend.
I have all that stuff at home,
you know, minus the best friend part.
I know, but you hate working from home, ok?
and...and no helping any customers or answering the phone. I mean it.
uh, do you want me to unpack these?
no. No! My office is gonna be back to normal soon. Ok?
excuse me. All set here.
you know what? It's gonna be just like old times.
OK, let me get a copy of the contract for you.
you can just email it to me.
here are the keys.
I had the power turned back on for you.
we haven't set foot in the place in over 5 years,
so I have no idea what shape things are in.
um, would you like to see the appraisals?
I trust you.
all the antiques came with the house,
so whatever you think.
you can have it all cleared out by next week?
next week? Um...
my husband is already in London,
so the sooner I can sell both our houses and join him, the better.
OK. Well, if you need a real estate agent, I can recommend...
it's all taken care of. Thanks.
um, we never finished the restoration.
it turned out to be too big a job.
so be careful.
thanks for the heads-up.
catch you later, mom.
see you, Melinda.
Nope. Not so fast. That was Donna peyton.
she's brought an entire house of antiques on consignment.
you wanna pick up some extra cash?
there's no such thing as extra cash.
great. Get started packing, take some pictures.
Oh, and be careful.
Hello! Anyone there?
Hello?
Hello?
OK...
is somebody there?
I have a friend who can help you.
hello.
Hello?
hello.
OK, I get it.
chains rattling? Seriously?
and then some.
I'm sorry you got hurt.
I'm fine, but there's a really pissed off ghost in that house.
if you could confirm that appointment for me,
wednesday at 2 P. M. that'd be great.
OK. Thanks. Bye.
Oh, my god. What now?
haunted house.
nothing's broken.
this is all I managed to grab before the show started.
so there's a lot more?
it's like they just left everything exactly where it was and took off.
or were scared off.
don't come back,
or you'll be dead, too.
you said there's a problem?
one of my employees was injured yesterday in the house.
he's ok, but some strange things were happening,
and I just wanted to know why you and your husband Left so abruptly.
Oh, it was a money pit...
dry rot, dangerously outdated electrical.
so it had nothing to do with the death of your daughter?
how did you know about that?
I do research on all of my clients,
and I found Cassidy's obituary.
she was a beautiful little girl.
Yes, she was.
in so many ways.
she was only 8 when she died.
Louis-barr syndrome.
my husband's a doctor.
he told me about it.
must have been awful.
we had moved back to Grandview, uh,
so she could get treatment at Rockland Memorial.
we thought this house would be a new beginning for us.
so you lived here before?
as a child, yeah. It's such a lovely town.
then when I saw that the house was for sale, It all felt like destiny.
destiny?
Heh. It's silly, I guess,
but when I was a kid, I used to walk home from school,
back when you could do that without becoming an amber alert.
anyway, there was this really sweet old lady who lived there.
she always had children playing in the yard.
it looked so peaceful, Almost like a storybook cottage.
did anything strange happen when you were living there?
well, sometimes Cass would wake up screaming in the middle of the night,
said there were people in her room, scary people.
and things were constantly getting broken.
I mean, paul and I both thought it was just Cassidy's muscle spasms, but she always blamed it on the other people in the house.
I mean, we didn't believe her until...
strange things started happening to you and your husband.
Yeah. Violent things...
uh, furniture falling over, Dishes flying off the shelves, Doors slamming... usually around midnight,
the same time Cassidy would wake up.
2 weeks after she died,
something pushed my husband down the stairs, and we haven't been back since.
wait. Her ghost was inside the mirror?
Yeah. Not for long. It's like she didn't wanna show herself,
so she hid in the mirror.
here, mommy. Let me help. You and daddy work too much.
that's sweet. Good man.
wait a minute.
so why would she haunt her own parents, especially so violently?
I'm not even sure if it was her.
I mean, she told her mother about people in the house, scary people.
apparently she would wake up at midnight screaming.
you know, maybe the ghosts were stuck in some kind of loop Living the same experience over and over again.
there was noises, furniture moving, things breaking. Aah!
Oh. I'm sorry.
Hey, you ok? Aiden, you all right?
no, baby. It's ok. It was an accident.
no, it wasn't. My arms,
they jerked.
they moved on their own.
that's just called a spasm, ok?
look, um, why don't I read to you while you take your bath, huh?
how's that sound, buddy? Okay.
what happened?
Oh, I...I think Aiden is empathing Cassidy's illness.
it'll be fine once I get her into the light.
um, I failed you.
there's nothing on the peyton house.
all the original plans and deeds and titles and tax information was lost in a fire at the city archives.
Oh. The fire from 6 years ago?
actually, the first fire, 1945.
place has a knack for going up in smoke, I guess.
so there's no information about the previous owner?
the only thing I could find was a lien that was placed on the house by the irs in 1952,
with "unknown" written where the owner's name should be and "deceased" stamped on one of the pages.
anyway, the court put it up for auction about 6 years ago.
Donna and her husband were the only ones who made a bid.
they lived there for about 18 months, and then they left.
and that's all I could find, so...
I'm sorry.
Hey, you know, um, you wanna have a glass of wine?
I mean, we haven't had a chance to talk about...
the explosion that almost killed me?
or you?
or Ned?
or the fact that Ned has already been In the emergency room twice this year
because of your ghosts?
Delia... what?!
I am sorry, Melinda, but this is getting too dangerous.
to what, be my friend?
let me ask you something.
what happened to Ned yesterday in that house,
it sounds like Cassidy was trying to scare him away, right?
if it was even Cassidy. I'm not...
well, whoever it was, she said, "stay away, or you will be dead, too.
ghosts are unreliable.
you should know that by now.
Really?
why don't you tell that to the ghost.
that warned you that president Bedford was gonna die in my office?
maybe you should start paying attention to them for a change.
look, there is a scared little girl who's locked in a house with angry, dangerous ghosts.
Yes, and this is all the more reason for you not to get involved!
or for you to involve my son.
let this one go, Melinda.
please, let it go.
I am begging you.
you know I can't do that.
if you're here, it's ok. I can help you.
please...
just talk to me.
you have to hurry.
you don't have to hide from me.
whatever's keeping you here, I...
I can help you go into the light.
it's safe there.
Oh, no. I'm not allowed.
of course you are.
did someone tell you that?
we're alone now.
follow me.
this hatbox...
is this what you wanted to show me?
it's in there, but hurry.
right there, in that wall.
all right, enough!
whoever you are, just let Cassidy go.
get out.
hurry.
Cassidy, who are you afraid of?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Cassidy, wait!
the ghosts don't want Cassidy to go into the light.
they told her she's not allowed to.
did you say, "ghosts," plural?
Yeah. I think they're the scary people her mom had been talking about.
I felt their presence, and it was angry.
enough to try to kill you with a wheelchair?
apparently. Whoever they are, they're hiding,
and if we don't find out some history about that house, we're stuck.
this box is impossible.
Yeah. I couldn't find anything like it on the internet.
maybe the ghost... s don't want you to open it.
Cassidy does. She's asking for our help.
why doesn't she just tell you why the other ghosts won't let her leave?
mm, because for some reason, she's terrified of them.
that makes two of us.
this emblem looks familiar.
let me see.
it's a raven, as in nevermore.
which is good advice for visiting that house.
it was a raven that flew at me.
do you think that means something?
sure. Any guesses?
what's all that?
old receipts, all with the same handwriting,
all marked "services rendered ,"
all dating back before 1943 with no names.
services rendered? What kind of services?
eh, we'll add that to the list of questions.
photo negatives.
Yeah. I couldn't see what was on them.
I have a scanner that handles photo negatives.
I'm on it.
and what about the toys in the attic?
and Cassidy's mom said she remembered seeing children playing in the yard, right?
what, you think the ghosts in the house are all kids?
why would they be so violent?
I mean, first going after you, then me.
I'm gonna work from home after all.
Hey, Ned, can I talk to you, please?
Yeah. Sure.
I really don't want you involved With this anymore. It's dangerous.
mom, I know you're still freaked out about the explosion,
but I promise I can take care of myself.
no. I'm serious.
I can't just bail on Melinda.
how do you know? You never even tried.
just say no this once.
say no.
just let me get one good night's sleep, ok?
Yeah, that... that's her.
that's the old lady who used to smile and wave at me.
I remember feeling sorry for her because of the wheelchair.
there's something else I have to tell you.
my friends were able to date the film stock, and...
these photos were taken in the early 1940s.
that's when my father was born, so that can't be the same woman I saw.
actually, it could.
I think you were seeing her ghost.
um, since I was a little girl,
I've...I've been able to talk with a-and see ghosts.
and you still see them?
most kids lose their gift around the same time they stop believing in magic.
I didn't.
so Cassidy was seeing ghosts.
apparently you were, too.
as a kid, I mean.
the house hasn't been occupied since 1952,
so I think the children you saw were ghosts and they're still there.
all those nights, she was so terrified,
and we didn't believe her, just told her to go back to bed.
Oh, she must have felt so alone.
you couldn't have known.
and I'm afraid that there's more.
I've talked to Cassidy,
and she's still there.
what? She...she is?
did she die there?
no. No, the hospital.
OK. Well, then something brought her back, and it must be that woman.
wait. Are you telling me my... my little girl Is trapped there by that old lady,
but why? Who...who was she?
we don't know.
all we have is the last name Hanson.
you can see it,
right there on the mail slot.
I...I don't... I don't understand.
spirits are supposed to go into the light,
but for some reason, in this house,
they don't want your daughter to cross over.
are they, um... are they hurting her?
is that even possible?
there's still a lot to figure out.
but whatever it is, I will bring her peace.
I promise.
that's defense. Huh? Right?
hello.
Hey. How'd it go with Donna?
she believe you?
I had pretty convincing evidence.
Hey, what you got there, baby?
you left it on the table.
am I in trouble?
no. Of course not. It looks like You made more progress than anybody.
it's pretty cool.
and remember, don't call me baby anymore.
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
so Delia moved her stuff out of the store today,
said she'd rather work from home.
Ah. Think she's still pretty rattled, huh?
Yeah. I can't say that I blame her.
you ok, man? What's going on?
my arms again.
you know what?
I - it's just Cassidy, ok?
it's gonna be over soon, I promise.
um, do you want some cocoa?
Yeah, pal. Why don't I make it?
OK. Come on
Mel. Hey, what's going on? What's wrong?
I just saw people being murdered.
the other ghosts in the house, right?
I think those were locks of their hair.
why would that lady keep them hidden in her house?
because she doesn't want anybody to know.
look, didn't Cassidy warn you that if you didn't stay away from there, you'd be dead, too?
Yeah, but she's the one who just showed me those.
it's like she's warning me again.
about the old woman?
maybe those are souvenirs from other ghosts.
maybe she murderred them all.
Cassidy, I know about the other ghosts.
if they're keeping you here, I can help you.
what is this?
did you bring the tribute?
thank you.
and the embodiment?
excellent.
I already sense her.
now place your hands flat on the table in front of you.
mine will stay constrained throughout the session to prove there's no trickery.
let us begin.
denizens of the spirit world...
your loved ones call you tonight not to disturb you from your troubled sleep,
but to help you find peace.
tonight we call Naomi,
beloved daughter of Virgil and Esther.
a seance.
are you kidding me?
Naomi, will you come to us?
are you Naomi?
they killed me.
Naomi, will you give us a sign that you're with us?
they killed me!
no. No, you're upsetting her.
Naomi is with us now.
she wants you to know her death came quickly.
stop! You're lying! She's gone!
she says she loves you.
she's going into the light now.
stop it!
she lied to us,
and our families.
there was never any light.
dream?
that old woman was pretending to be a medium when she was alive.
I was a ghost at one of her seances, if you can believe that.
OK, her name is Greta hanson, also known as madame Greta.
she set up shop in Grandview in 1924,
during the whole spiritualism revival.
she died in 1943 when her wheelchair rolled down the stairs.
more likely a ghost pushed her.
Where'd you get this?
I spent hours searching "hanson" plus "spiritualism,
and "medium" and "seance" and found exactly nothing.
professor Grant gave me the t. A. Job.
I now have full access to the copeland wing at the library.
I hate you.
Madame Greta operated under the radar,
held her sessions in a secret room,
worked strictly by private referral, and made a killing,
so to speak.
Yeah, off the suffering of grieving people and frustrated ghosts.
she must have been pretty convincing.
Harry Houdini even attended one of her seances,
but never publicly debunked her.
Yeah, probably because, according to Melinda,
she was able to attract ghosts,
but she just couldn't actually communicate with them.
so the murder visions that Melinda had,
could the old woman have been a medium and a serial killer?
you know, so she'd always have fresh ghosts to contact?
maybe not. Melinda said a man at the seance brought a lock of hair.
as an embodiment.
mediums sometimes asked for something personal from the deceased.
and the ghost in Melinda's dream said,"they killed me."
Yeah. Mel said she looked like she'd been strangled.
so maybe madame Greta specialized in contacting murder victims.
OK, so the ghosts aren't kids after all,
but what happened to the children that Cassidy's mom saw?
and why is Cassidy stuck in a house with a bunch of murdered people?
Ahh. You're giving me a headache.
sounds like a good time to go and chat with some ghosts.
a field trip to the house of whacked spirits at the witching hour? Thank you, no.
besides, your mom said ghosts are off limits.
I know, but since I can't talk to them anyhow
a-and I know you're not gonna let Melinda go alone...
OK. I'll call her.
Jim finally got Aiden to sleep, - So we should get going. - Do we even have a plan?
Yeah. Our first priority is to get her out of that house,
and convince her to cross over into the light.
but we don't even know what we're up against.
we have madame Greta, murder victims.
who knows how many?
and if they're all just trying to keep Cassidy there...
trust me. When she sees her mommy, she's gonna come to us.
let's go.
I told you to stay away.
Cassidy, you're here.
look. Let me call your mommy.
I have to go.
I'll get in trouble for talking to you.
from who? Who are you afraid of?
them.
she's looking for her.
she's angry.
who, madame Greta?
who are you?
what is it, chains?
what's going on?
you were both in prison.
she's coming.
Cassidy, hurry.
no, no! Wait!
they're gone.
you said they were prisoners?
Yeah. And they both had burns and lacerations, like they'd been executed.
you know, the visions I had of...of murders,
maybe it wasn't from the victim.
what if I was seeing it all through the killer's eyes?
wait a minute.
are you saying all the other ghosts in the house are murderers?
the ghosts of murderers?
and they're keeping Cassidy trapped in that house?
I don't know if they are murderers.
I mean, we ided them by the numbers on their uniform.
they were convicted in the twenties, executed in the thirties,
and since then, they'd been proven innocent.
you saw people being killed, didn't you?
I know. Which means that they're not the only ghosts in that house.
I mean, Ned told me that madame Greta's brother was hanged for murder.
she went into spiritualism to try to prove that he was innocent,
and it became her specialty as a medium.
she didn't even have the gift.
all she did was attract hundreds of ghosts to that house,
murderers and people who were wrongfully executed.
wait. So the innocent ones are still there.
where are the guilty ones?
hiding from me, or maybe they went into the light.
and the innocent ones didn't. Shouldn't it be the other way around?
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense,
but there's gotta be some kind of good reason.
Yeah. Oh, wait.
you know, executions are usually scheduled at midnight.
that might have something to do with the timing of your hauntings.
Yeah, but not why they won't let Cassidy cross over.
I'll be right back.
all right. Hey.
you can't help her.
I don't believe that.
the two of you who appeared to me, you were innocent, weren't you?
why didn't you go into the light?
we won't leave Cassidy.
we can't.
you're protecting her?
and you.
from what? The ghosts?
the ones who were guilty?
Yes, but they aren't ghosts anymore.
wh-what are you...
there, my sweet.
soon you can come play with all the lovely toys at my house forever.
you and my friend Cassidy here will have such fun.
you'll see.
are you home?
no. I'm in Eli's office doing a little research.
is it econ, or are you still helping out Melinda?
mom, this one's huge.
Melinda needs all the help she can get.
Ned, we talked about this.
I know, but this is amazing.
this house is full of ghosts, and for some reason,
they won't let this poor little girl go into the light.
listen, it is great that you care about her,
and that you found something that you're passionate about, but, Ned,
listen to me.
a ghost kidnapped Aiden. Another one killed president Bedford.
you have been hurt twice. When are you gonna understand
this is too dangerous?
apparently more dangerous than even Melinda realizes.
what?
mom, I gotta go.
I'll call you from the car and explain.
no, no, no...
Ned. Ned, hold...
Hello?
bedtime.
I know where your boy is all the time. Do you?
don't you dare threaten my son.
they stay out of my business.
Ned, hey. Tell us what's going on.
I found out what the raven means, the one on the puzzle box.
OK, in the "book of changes"?
first I asked Professor Grant about it.
she said that an emblem like this on a tombstone represents a guardian of the soul.
what's that have to do with the book?
I'll show you.
the book must have erased it.
doesn't it only do that when it's worried about the shadows?
Yeah, and if it has something to do with the shadows, that explains a few things.
one of the prisoners told me that the other convicts are in the house, but they're not ghosts anymore.
but how could they be there and not be ghosts?
if they change into shadows.
all right, help me out.
it's what the shinies told Aiden...
or what he saw happening to Julia. Right.
shadows, they prey on your guilt.
they break your spirit apart, and they feed on the pieces.
you know, I think I've seen something like this before, But I just didn't know what it was,
these dark, angry ghosts that don't really cross over.
they more cross under.
maybe that's the shadows.
maybe that's how they multiply.
Yeah, and these are just Especially interested in children.
but if shadows exploit your guilt,
why are they so caught up on Cassidy?
what does she have to be so guilty about?
I don't know.
maybe nothing.
maybe that's why she's still here.
Jim, help me pack up everything shiny.
and don't let Aiden out of your sight, ok? Ok.
and can you call Eli? I'll meet you guys at the house.
I'm gonna call Cassidy's mom on the way.
Melinda, be careful.
what's going on?
is Cassidy here?
I need you to talk to her,
tell her that it's safe to come outside.
we don't have a lot of time.
sweetie.
you could come out.
it's ok. Please?
mommy.
mommy, you shouldn't be here.
it's ok. All right? We're safe for now.
look, she's here.
I'll explain later, but we have to hurry.
I...I wish I could see her one last time.
don't be sad, mommy.
she doesn't want you to be sad.
how could I not be?
if we had just listened to her when she told us about the scary people,
we would have left this house sooner.
will you...will you tell her that?
she can hear you.
can you ever forgive us?
I was never mad at you.
she was never angry with you.
look, Cassidy, I have to ask you something.
Madame Greta, she brings children here for a reason, doesn't she?
it's ok.
you can tell the truth. She isn't here.
but she said if I told anyone, I'd be punished.
she can't hurt you. All right?
and the other ghosts, the lady and the man,
they were protecting you, weren't they?
we protect each other.
whenever the cold things come.
the shadows.
Yeah. I felt that cold before.
so how do you protect each other?
we make a circle so they'll go away, but they always come back,
and they're getting stronger.
so that's why you didn't wanna leave?
because you were afraid that the cold things would take your friends away?
like they did to the others,
all of them.
the children, too?
look, it's not safe for you to be here, ok?
do you see a light?
no.
what is it? Does she see the light?
please, just tell her that it's ok.
tell her to see the light.
you can go with her.
both of you.
Cassidy, you've helped us stay safe for so long.
now you have to help yourself.
OK?
that's pretty.
my friends can come, too?
Really?
she sees the light.
look, all of you just go.
OK? It's where you belong,
and you're gonna be safe there, I...I promise.
I love you, mommy.
she says she loves you.
sorry. We got here as fast as we could.
did Cassidy cross over?
no. What?
Madame Greta stopped her,
and I think she's just getting warmed up.
Cassidy? What is it? What's going on?
it's ok. I'll explain later.
Ned, put all these things by the windows.
Eli, open the blinds. They don't like light.
hurry up, and whatever you do, do not turn these things off.
can count on that.
open the ones in front, too. - I'm on it.
it's ok for you to come back.
you said we could go. You promised.
look, do you see the light? Is it still open?
Yes, but I'm scared.
there's nothing for you to be scared of.
you just go, ok? It's gonna be fine. tell her.
I-it's ok. Do what Melinda says.
it's too late!
they're here,
and they're angry with you.
get out while you can.
no. I am not leaving until you guys go into the light.
Oh, boy.
just stay here.
we did nothing wrong.
the child stays with me.
no. No. All you've been doing is using her to lure other ghosts here. That's over.
Cassidy's too naughty to go into the light.
she tricked all those other little ghosts.
we, we! That's a lie.
don't listen to her! Cassidy, she's just saying that to make you feel bad for something you didn't do.
she couldn't stand being alone,
so she lied to those other ghosts so she could have friends.
that's why the light's not for her. She doesn't deserve it.
I don't?
no, Cassidy, don't listen to her.
listen to your friends.
you did nothing wrong.
we need more shiny stuff.
there's silver everywhere.
grab it and spread it around.
look!
the shadows, they blocked us in!
move it! Hurry!
you did nothing wrong.
Cassidy, you didn't do anything wrong. Don't you understand?
that's why the shadows haven't taken you, because you're innocent.
stop interfering. Get out of my house!
now!
the shadows are killing the lights, even the headlights!
you know what? The only one guilty here is you.
OK, you took advantage of people when you were alive, but you were lying,
and all you were doing was bringing tortured souls back to the shadows.
that's enough.
now you're feeding them children
because it's either them or you.
be quiet!
what is that?
the headlights, they're coming back on.
Cassidy, go!
go right now!
tell mommy and daddy I love them!
I promise! Go! Run, Cassidy!
No!
I'll find more for you, hundreds of them!
all the children you need! Just, please, I beg you!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Ned, Melinda! Oh, my god.
are you ok? Delia!
I am now.
wait. So Greta had some kind of deal with the shadows?
she fed them ghosts, and they didn't feed on her?
apparently.
there's only one thing I don't understand.
what got into you?
showing up all nick of time, Like, heroic and stuff?
please. I'm no hero.
somebody's gotta look after you guys.
the trouble is my lunatic son is a hero,so what am I supposed to do?
be a hero, too.
OK, maybe just this once.
but don't get used to it.
real estate is my business. This heroing...
Ned learned everything from you.
would you promise just to be careful, for god's sake?
right, kid. Listen to your mother, all right?
and you, too.
what's wrong?
I just wish we knew what was so important about children's ghosts.
what do the shadows want with them?
Hey, Danny, how far is the party, anyway?
Hey, you sure this is the right way?
we're getting close.
this party better be worth it, dude.
these parties are always awesome.
you sure you know where we're going?
I'm tellin' you this is faster. The quarry is right up here on the right.
Greg, you coming?
I heard something.
what?
I thought I saw something moving.
it's probably just a raccoon.
Shh. Did you hear that?
let's just get to the party before everybody leaves.
what the...
that's not the quarry. - Ok, great.
so it's official. We're lost, aren't we?
they're all gonna be gone, man.
I've hiked out here a lot.
which is why we followed you.
I screwed up.
all I'm sayin' is I never saw this place before.
let's go...
check it out.
Oh, great, now it's raining.
looks abandoned.
ahh, damn. What is this?
who dug all these holes in the ground?
probably some kind of trap or somethin'.
somebody was lookin' for something.
like what?
something they really wanted to find. Look at all these.
there's something hidden here, something valuable.
has to be, right?
maybe it's inside.
come on.
go that way.
let's split up and see what's here.
you guys hear me?
come on, you guys. I heard you moving around.
guys, what just happened? Come on. Who screamed?
Greg: It's me. I'm ok.
Danny, is that you? Say something.
Hey, Danny. Come on, man. Say something.
Danny, cut it out. Answer us.
Danny: This is freaky. What is that?
Danny, where are you?!
Danny, answer us!
Danny: go, you guys! Go! Get out of here! Run!
run, run!
Greg, come on!
get out, get out, something's behind us, hurry!
Where's Danny?
I-- I don't know. I thought he was right behind me.
Oh, god.
look, I heard breathing.
so did i.
Danny! Why won't you answer?!
Danny, where are you?!
Hey, remember the ghost that I was telling you about, the one who was cooking in my kitchen?
well, after she left, I couldn't stop smelling pot roast.
shut up. She was that real?
should have sent her over to my place instead of into the light.
I love a good ghost roast.
something's happening with my visions.
it's like they're merging together with my reality, and I can't tell the two apart.
God, when are they gonna revoke your therapist's license?
and what are you doing? - I'm looking for a used scooter.
these are all motorized.
listen, you're one of the sanest people I know and the strongest, maybe even getting stronger, in fact.
what do you mean?
I don't know. Could be that you're tuning in to Aiden's powers. He's an empath, and when he feels something a ghost went through, it's entirely real for him and then to you, too.
fortunately, he doesn't remember it.
fortunately for ghosts, you do.
let me just get my wallet. I'll treat for coffee.
this isn't mine.
Dr. James.
I'm sorry.
I guess-- I guess I fell asleep.
look, I was up all night. I'm Greg Roth.
I saw you around midterms, remember?
what are you doin' here? - Your door was open.
look, I couldn't wait out there.
I couldn't talk to anyone about this.
OK, well, schedule a time for later today.
it could be too late then, ok? A friend of mine is missing.
well, did you tell the police?
what am I gonna say? My drunk buddy wandered off last night?
they'll say he's probably just sleeping it off.
and you think that something else happened?
we heard something.
we felt something that made my skin crawl.
OK, but we never saw it.
we never saw anything.
OK, Greg, tell us what happened.
look, we were out in the woods, you know, partying, and we found this barn.
three of us went in, but only two of us came out.
Greg, tell us everything you know.
we're going to help you find your friend.
Eli: you sure there's not some other place Danny might have gone?
maybe a girlfriend's, or...?
I told you, we called her.
we called all of our friends.
OK, anywhere he might have crashed.
it was 2: 00 in the morning.
what about his parents?
they're out of state.
well, if he's freaked out as you are, maybe he made the drive.
there was one car. And we left in it.
it was right after we went to the quarry.
we thought maybe he'd gone on ahead of us, you know. Maybe he was there waiting.
and the barn, did you go back to it?
not until this morning.
we looked everywhere. I'm telling you guys, he's gone.
I wanted to go back last night, but it was dark, and...
you were scared.
maybe you were right to be.
what does that mean?
what does Dr. James mean about this gift that you have?
what are you so convinced that something terrible happened to your friend?
because everything about that place felt wrong.
OK, like some terrible thing had happened, or was going to.
something was there.
something that was not quite human.
the barn, can you take us to it?
this is what convinced you something so great was in the barn.
they're old, I know.
but somebody put a lot of work into looking for something.
well, maybe whoever is inside will tell us what that is.
what, the guy who got the heave ho and the no-frills burial?
something gave me that vision.
what are we looking for, giant ghost moles?
ghost what?!
uh, don't to listen to me, I'm using humor to cope.
is that what we're talking about?
ghosts?
is that your specialty?
uh, yes.
I can see ghosts.
well, uh, whose do you see?
I don't know. Your friend Danny, maybe.
OK, but Danny was alive when we came here.
OK, something else, or someone else, was already here.
Greg, just-- go wait in the car while we look around.
what happened? Let me go!
this place is a maze.
what's up? Did you figure anything out?
it's time to call the police.
well, there are no reported deaths at the barn, and no owner to ask about it.
OK, why are we looking for some other dead person when we have a missing college student, and you saw someone get hurt in that barn?
because the student was still alive when they'd sensed something.
OK, so if the ghost was already there, what did he do with the kid?
then who was holding the shovel scooping big piles of mud onto whoever died?
well, if anybody would ever talk to us, maybe we'd find out.
you know what, if detective blair was still here...
we'd be trusted resources, not some kind of cagey flakes who can't say how they get this most incredible useful information.
easy, tiger.
we don't know if we have any useful information yet.
Hi. I'm detective Colson.
are you the people who reported a missing student out near route 44?
Yeah, just south of Lawson's corner.
I'm a professor over at Rockland University.
I'm Eli James.
this is Melinda Gordon.
how can I help you?
well, here's the thing.
we were talking to detective Simon.
we were trying to, anyway.
Yeah, I know, I heard, he got pulled on another case.
you were saying this student, Danny Seitz, went missing after some kind of a break-in in a barn?
how do you know about it? Do you own the property?
look, this is going to sound crazy, but we have very good reasons to believe that this kid was not just missing, but maybe hurt.
go on.
look, the thing is, we know that college kids like to stay out all night.
they don't like to report in to anyone.
right, but this one vanished last night while his friends were screaming for him, and I don't know, I just have a feeling.
you're actually listening to us.
why is that?
night before last, there was a robbery on stonebridge, about a half hour from this property.
and the suspect, the armed suspect, got away.
empty barn's a pretty good place to hide out.
you don't think when a cop says an armed fugitive might be some place, that's a place to avoid?
look, if someone's here
and killed Danny and buried him in some hole in the ground.
he wouldn't stick around.
you know this because of all your close, personal relationships with armed fugitives?
this area is clear.
let's take it around back.
Hello?
I know you're here.
I can feel you.
or...
whoever you are, you don't have to hide from me, ok?
I want to help you.
No!
what happened? Are you ok? - Fine.
then why'd you scream? You saw something.
it was probably nothing, like a rat.
Oh, yeah. She hates rats, fears them. Many people do. Believe me.
did I mention I'm a therapist?
you know, I brought you here because I thought you could be helpful.
because I thought you wanted to be.
we can! We do want to be.
well, then be straight with me.
this feeling you had.
more cases than you know have been solved by a lot less-- A cop's intuition.
help me find this boy, because I think something happened to him, too.
and maybe it's not too late.
I see ghosts.
and I saw someone being shot over here, and then their body was thrown in a hole and buried.
and you saw this missing kid?
I've seen his face online.
so I know what he looks like.
but I haven't seen anyone's face in my visions.
I should show you something.
now, I don't know if somebody cut themselves or worse, but there was blood.
pretty fresh from the looks of it.
fresh as in last night?
is there more? Is there anything you're not telling me?
man on radio: Detective Colson.
go for Colson.
we need you outside immediately. Found human remains.
man on radio: sir, forensic unit is en route.
OK. Forensics are on their way, but keep going.
Eli: who the hell is he?
well, whoever he is, he's been dead for more than one night.
fresh blood and old bones?
sounds like a recipe for total confusion.
not if what the kids sensed was a ghost.
Mr. Bones.
what about the fresh blood?
guess it was Danny's.
and the buried body and the gunshot?
I didn't hear the kid say anything about hearing a gunshot.
maybe the vision you had was for something that happened to Danny later.
maybe he wasn't shot at the barn but someplace else later.
maybe. Any word on the skeleton?
Yeah, the coroner sent the DNA sample to missing persons bureau and they got a hit.
these bones belong to a kid named Henry Alston.
get this-- he was kidnapped a decade ago, and never found.
well, until now.
I had no idea about this, but this is a big deal to the cops.
it was a huge unsolved mystery.
Alston? As in the Alstons, who donated a building to this university?
Yeah, and gave a wing to this hospital, and then gave $2 million to the kidnappers.
their son was never found.
the money was never traced.
kidnappers disappeared.
I've been watching this video online.
it's his parents on a local television station begging the kidnappers for their son's live.
he was 18 years old.
think he's our ghost?
I don't know. I haven't seen him yet.
excuse me. Detective Colson?
Yeah. I can come by.
woman: thank you for bringing Henry home.
that's the last form.
ms. Alston?
yes?
Hi. My name is Melinda Gordon.
I was there when they found your son.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
thank you.
it's so strange.
I've known for years that Henry must be dead.
but there was always just a little part of me that...hoped.
you're his mother.
of course you hoped.
they give that to you...
the kidnappers.
that's what ransom is, hope.
you think you can buy it with money.
the almighty Alston fortune.
look what it bought us.
I knew what I was marrying into. It's just...
you were worried.
long before the kidnapping.
so many of Henry's cousins fell into the same trap.
they didn't know how to work for anything, they never had the chance.
we didn't want that for our son.
We...were so careful.
how?
Oh, Henry always knew he'd have to make his own way in this world.
Oh, give him a good home and the best education, and all the tools he'd need to succeed, but not the money.
well, I'm sure it made him a stronger person.
it did. Even at boarding school.
Henry could see past all the fancy last names.
his best friend were the scholarship kids.
you know, parents are cops, teachers.
he would have been a really good man.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I called because I hit a wall.
the robbery suspect I told you about; the one on the run, he was caught. He stole a car here and made it all the way to Florida.
so he was gone long before Danny went missing.
but I'm left with a bunch of puzzle pieces that don't fit.
I've got one missing student, a trail of blood, that as it turns out, matches his type and reason to believe, thanks to you, that either the student or Henry Alston was shot.
I wish I knew more.
look...
I don't know how you do what you do.
we found this at the scene down in a hole with fresh blood on it.
may I?
I saw someone.
in the barn. A man. - The student, Danny?
I don't know, it was a man, and he was taking these bags out of this dirty space.
what kind of space? - I couldn't tell.
what did the bags look like? Did you see anything identifiable?
they were rectangular, blue canvas, about this big.
banks use bags like that to transport deposits.
so maybe it was the ransom money, then?
in that barn? After all these years?
did you see anyone?
for all I know, I could have been looking right at the kidnappers.
or that kid from the other night. Danny.
maybe that's why he's missing.
Hey. Are you still up for yoga?
sure. Just let me get my stuff.
any word on that missing college kid?
no, nothing.
any sighting on the ghost, Henry?
no. Which makes me wonder if he is the ghost.
well, why? He was buried there.
because if you're just hanging around,
I mean, wouldn't you at least try to find me?
I don't know, maybe get some justice.
Ooh. Eli, what's up?
Eli: Danny is still alive.
Oh, that's great, I'm so relieved.
they arrested him at the Canadian border with $80, 000 cash in his trunk.
Phew. That's gotta be part of the ransom money, right?
I'm gonna go talk to Colson. See if I can find out anything more.
I'll talk to you later. - Ok, thanks, bye.
so he's under arrest, but he's safe?
well, not necessarily.
I mean, what if all the hauntings at the barn just have to do with cash?
Yeah, but why does a ghost care about money?
well, if the ghost is Henry Alston, how would you feel if a bunch of drunk kids were stealing money that you had to die for?
Yeah, but didn't the parents pay $2 million?
Where's the rest of it?
Hello?
is anybody here?
it's ok.
it's ok, just keep looking.
they brought him in right after the shift change.
he fell through a rotted floorboard in the barn, and he was unconscious there most of the night.
is he ok?
Yeah. He had a concussion.
he got some stitches, but otherwise he's fine.
it's a good thing he had his cell phone.
he came to and called 9-1-1.
has detective Colson been here?
Yeah. He was here, and with a uniform.
and I thought you'd want to talk to this kid, especially after I saw who was visiting.
I thought Danny was in jail.
out on bail.
I spoke to your friend Greg.
he told me that he felt something in that barn.
something that wanted to scare you or hurt you or both.
he said that you felt it, too.
Yeah, I did. From the moment we went in.
so then why did you go back?
for the money.
he went back for the money.
Scott, it's time to come clean.
cause when the police brought me back here,
I realized that there had to be more.
kidnappers must have split it up to come back for it later.
well, they didn't get it.
not all of it.
that's why there were all those holes in the ground, right?
so you sent Scott back to look for more.
when I went back, it was like something was leading me.
I figured to the money. But...
the floor was totally rotten, and I guess it was just a trap.
or punishment.
whatever was in that barn didn't want us there.
I saw something moving.
I had this feeling like something was crawling up the back of my neck.
I screamed.
my leg went through the floor.
it was stuck. And that's when I noticed there was something hidden down there.
money.
lots of it.
and you were willing to bail on your friends and your life?
my folks can't get a job.
the bank foreclosed on their house.
I can't pay for next semester anyway.
I figured I'd go to Canada, call my parents and start over again.
it sounds stupid, but when you have that much cash in your hands like that, it's hard to think straight.
I don't think you're the first person to feel that way.
or the last.
look, whoever you are, whatever you did, it's over now.
but I think I can help find you peace.
you know, you can't punish people, not kids, for wanting money.
I don't need to.
money destroys everything.
but it's gone now, and no one will ever find it.
Henry, what happened to you?
how long have I been here?
11 years.
do you remember who did this?
I have no idea. I never saw their faces.
I went out for a ride just to get some air.
I didn't even hear him pull up.
Hey, you need some help there, pal? - He asked if I needed some help.
get in the van!
everything you read says to run.
never get into a stranger's car.
I knew that.
but when you're looking at a gun...
did you see who was holding it?
I never saw their faces.
but what about after you died?
I was in a dark space so long, I wasn't even sure what had happened.
by the time I realized, everyone was gone.
I've been alone here ever since.
I saw you digging.
did they let you out?
I was digging my own grave.
why did you stay here?
weren't you drawn to your family?
I knew they'd be in so much pain.
but I can help you talk to them.
wouldn't that hurt them more; stirring it all up again?
they've been through enough. Leave them be.
look, it's just your mom now.
but I think that I can bring both of you peace.
I can't feel anything.
that's peace enough.
Hey. Look, yeah, I got your message.
the police do have all of Henry Alston's personal effects.
his bones are still here? Yeah...
I need to see them.
OK. What's going on?
I just talked to him.
so he is your ghost?
Yeah. He told me what happened to him.
at first, he was numb and lost and I felt bad for him.
and then he told me that his kidnappers made him dig his own grave.
that's funny. That's just about the time I would have started to feel worse for him.
Yeah, it's just in my vision, he was being thrown into a ditch.
OK, the one in which they actually found his bones?
Yeah, the soil was wet and muddy.
but when he was digging, it was dry.
well, maybe they killed him before he was finished, or maybe it was raining, right?
or maybe he was digging something else, or someone else.
what are you looking for?
well, since I don't have anything of his, I figured I'd go straight to the source.
slow down.
last thing you need to do is get pulled over right now.
what is it?
the last thing the ghost wanted me to see.
Henry was in on it.
he staged his own kidnapping.
thanks for meeting me.
I ordered you a black coffee. - Thanks. Look, I get it.
ghosts probably aren't your favorite topic in a police station.
you said you saw something, a vision?
I couldn't stop thinking about what Henry's mom said, about cutting him off from the family money for his own good.
and I had a vision of the kidnapping, and there was this moment afterwards where Henry was alone in the van with his captors, and he wasn't exactly afraid.
you think Henry was in on his own kidnapping.
you don't seem surprised.
I've been circling that same theory myself.
the only problem is, from what I read, all of Henry's friends checked out.
and if Henry was in on it, then why did he end up dead, and what happened to his share of the money?
I had 2 separate visions of the holes being dug.
the first was Henry's body outside the barn.
the ground was wet, like it had been raining, and the other was the hole he was digging, and it was dry.
so it was dry. What does that mean?
maybe it was inside the barn.
and you think the second hole was to bury the ransom money, why?
because he said that money destroys everything, so what if it destroyed his partnerships?
with his co-conspirators.
maybe once he and his buddies got their hands on the cash, somebody double crossed him, or he double crossed them.
because he wanted all the money for himself.
or because he knew that somebody else did, and he hid it to protect himself.
look, it would explain why Danny only got some of the money.
and the other holes outside the barn.
Thanks.
his buddies must think that's where he hid the ransom money.
you really should consider a job on the force.
Oh, I just want to help this spirit find some peace.
so what do you do now?
talk to his mother. You know, she deserves to know the truth and decide if she wants to forgive him.
and the ghost goes to a better place.
well, before he does, you can make my job a lot easier if you got him to tell me who killed him.
any chance of that?
trust me, you will be the first to know.
Jim: just make sure he keeps up with his meds, it's all good.
Melinda: Hey. Hey. Thanks.
Mrs. Alston come here? She was supposed to sign for her son's remains.
you just missed her. How'd it go with Colson?
you have any idea about Henry's accomplices?
all of Henry's friends were investigated. They found nothing.
Eli's going to check the yearbook and school records.
OK. Oh, you're leaving already? Where to?
I need Henry to talk to his mom.
all right. Be careful.
where have I heard that before?
Bye.
we need to talk.
your mom, she needs to hear from you.
look, I know that you stayed quiet to protect your parents, but it's too late now.
the police know what happened, and it's only a matter of time before it all comes out.
you know, I could talk to your mom.
tell her what happened.
what you did and why, and then once she forgives you
you don't know anything.
you're not helping me or anyone.
leave.
before it's too late.
you can't scare me away.
not like you did those kids.
I'm begging you.
leave this alone.
you're in danger.
what are you doing here?
Oh. I had to talk to the ghost.
those kidnappers, they could be anywhere. This thing's in the papers now.
Yeah, I know. Take a look.
someone's been here, those holes are new.
for your safety, I think you better leave.
I think I agree.
Hey, what's up?
Eli: remember Henry's mom said he became friends with the scholarship kids whose parents were teachers and cops?
Yeah, I remember.
well, one of those kids grew up to be an actual cop.
you'll never guess who it is.
just walk to your car.
don't show him you know who he is.
OK, I won't. - Eli: what's that tone?
what's going on? Is he there with you?
Yep, sure thing.
are-- are you at the barn? Should I call for help?
of course, and I'll talk to you later.
who was that?
Oh, it was my husband.
he wants to make me dinner tonight, and I have to stop by the store, so...
stop.
turn around.
I'm sorry.
but this is as far as you go.
look, you don't want to do this, ok?
that was my friend on the phone.
he knows where we are and what you did.
he knows that you met in school, and that you were Henry's accomplice, ok?
please don't make this any worse.
the police are going to be here soon.
you think I wanted my life to end up this way?
I never saw a dime of that money.
you know what I did for it?
please, you don't have to do this.
I do now. I have to go away.
you dug these holes right after I told you there was money in here.
only problem is, I didn't know where to dig.
neither do I.
no, but Henry does.
why would he tell you? You murdered him.
he won't let the same thing happen to you. He's way too soft.
is that why you fought?
because he wouldn't go through with it?
just take this shovel, and you tell me if he's here.
now!
I don't see him.
no?
well, I'll be he sees me.
tell him I'll do it. - Henry...
just trust me.
I thought so.
where is it?
tell him it's not really buried, it's inside that wall.
he said he was lying. He never buried it.
it's inside that wall.
give me that shovel.
you get over there.
move back.
I see it!
that son of a...
he said it was buried, why'd I believe him?
because you knew he was better than you.
look, I'm sorry.
I really am. But I have no choice.
there's always a choice, Jeff.
No!
Eli: the reason they missed it was because Colson was kicked out of boarding school.
he wasn't in the yearbook, and he wasn't in most of the high school files.
but I found him on somebody's face page.
so let me guess-- he got kicked out for stealing.
nice deduction, detective.
so he joined the force just to stay on the case of his own missing money?
no, he needed a job and his dad helped him get it.
so did the ghost tell you why he decided to fake his own kidnapping?
not yet.
I don't understand.
I just...I don't understand.
tell her it was nothing she did.
tell her I was an idiot.
I think she needs more than that.
go ahead.
at first it didn't bother me, the money thing.
the trust fund brats, they drove their beamers, they did their club scene downtown, I didn't care.
I studied. I worked out.
I did my own thing.
then I met Jeff.
what's up, man? - He was funny, and quick.
he really wanted to be one of those rich kids.
when he found out I had money, too, he couldn't believe I didn't live like it.
I told him my parents didn't believe in that.
that seemed to tick him off.
he kept saying that rich people only got rich by taking what they wanted.
and if I wanted the freedom that I deserved,
I should reach out and take what was already mine.
at first I just laughed him off.
but I started to listen when he talked about how mom and dad didn't trust me.
did they think I was so weak, the money would take away all of my morals?
he made friends with Jeff, and Jeff questioned why you guys kept money from him.
he thought you didn't trust him.
no.
we just wanted Henry to know what it felt like to earn his own success.
Henry's father knew better than anyone; when money's handed to you, it can take away all your ambition, and your self worth.
well, either way, they were right.
my money was stronger than I was.
I let Jeff talk me into the kidnapping.
get in the van!
we did it, man! We did it!
she knows that you were a part of it.
she just doesn't understand what happened next.
after mom and dad paid the ransom, we holed up in that farmhouse out near the barn.
the plan was to wait until the cops stopped watching the airports.
then we'd leave the country, live off the money.
but while we were waiting, we watched TV.
Mrs. Alston: we don't care about punishing anyone.
and there were my parents.
we paid his ransom, just release our son!
every day, they'd be begging for my release.
I just wanted them to know that I was ok.
I wanted to go home.
I didn't care if he kept the money.
I'd tell the cops I got away.
I swore I'd never tell anyone what really happened.
but Jeff wouldn't trust me. - You can't go home.
you don't think the cops are going to question you?
I won't tell them anything. Why would I?
all I care is that my parents never know.
the police are going to break you in half!
I know, my dad's a cop!
they can smell lies a mile off. It won't work!
I'm not doing this to my parents.
not anymore.
don't you walk out that door, man.
you're not going to shoot me. You can't.
Yes, I can.
then you'll never see that money again.
what does that mean? Where did you put it?
it's hidden. I buried it everywhere.
and if I die, you'll never find any of it.
I'm leaving, Jeff. I'll call you as soon as I get home, I promise.
you'll get all the money.
Henry! Don't, Henry!
I swear!
if he wanted money that badly...
I wish he'd just asked us.
I knew this was a bad idea.
he wished that you'd never found out the truth.
no.
no, that's wrong, Henry.
look at what I did to her.
God, I wish I'd never lived.
he can't forgive himself.
do you know when your father proposed, I almost said no.
I saw his cousins all over the tabloids, and I thought, I don't want my children to grow up like that.
but you didn't, Henry.
I know what kind of man you are.
and even now, even...
after everything I've lost, it was so worth it.
I don't deserve this.
he feels like he doesn't deserve your forgiveness.
Why?
why, you gave your life to heal my broken heart.
I would give mine to heal yours.
if you want to make it right, you have to accept her forgiveness.
you can see it now, can't you?
he sees the light.
does that mean he forgives himself?
will you tell her I see my dad in there?
and he's smiling.
I will.
he's gone.
Aiden: mom, dad?
all my friends get much more allowance than I do.
can I maybe have a raise?
Melinda: no. Money corrupts. I don't want to spoil him.
babe, he gets 25 cents a week.
that's a quarter.
OK, how about 30 cents?
sorry. Ghost on the brain.
you decide.
I'm gonna take out the trash.
Jim: look, 30 cents is better than nothing.
Carl! What are you doing here?
I thought you'd want to know, we have new information.
OK. What?
even though no one can see them but Aiden, we've observed a few things, talked to ghosts who've encountered them and survived...
you mean the shadows. - Right.
I sense them sometimes, and I'll suddenly feel so confused about everything.
it's like they're getting inside my head.
you said you observed things, like what?
they're just insatiable gluttons for energy.
so is that good news or bad news?
they're dangerous, Melinda, because they can't be reasoned with.
they're like your cop friend, the one you just sent to jail.
but he wanted money. You were saying that they're after energy.
they're both about greed, and the flipside of greed is fear.
OK, so how do we scare them away?
you don't want them afraid of you.
that's when they want to hurt you, or your son.
look, except for when they've tried to consume children's ghosts,
I have left the shadows alone.
all right, but you can't ask me to let them take children.
I'm not asking anything.
I'm just helping you understand.
greed and fear.
and if you had to focus on one of those, I'd make it fear.
No! - Wake up, mommy, wake up!
Melinda! - Oh, my God.
it was a vision, you're OK! It felt so real.
honey, they're just getting worse and worse.
Melinda said Carl was afraid the shadows were getting in his head.
you think the shadows are messing with Melinda's head?
we protect each other.
whenever the cold things come.
the shadows.
your son is in danger.
so what you're saying is that I can fix this
if I make Aiden not see ghosts.
or shadows.
don't you think we owe it to Aiden to try?
by changing him?
if it would keep my son safe and alive, I don't care.
watch out! I'm coming through!
look what I have!
Jim, wake up.
no.
get out of my way!
it's Aiden. He's talking to someone.
watch out! A bomb!
come here! Watch out!
what are you doing?
who are you talking to?
I was doing the voices.
Oh. Good. We thought you were talking to...
somebody else.
like who?
um, nobody. Nobody. Let's go to bed.
Yeah, do what your mom says, come on.
come on, buddy, let's get up.
I feel better.
what do you mean?
that there's no such thing as ghosts.
I feel better.
well, we feel better that you feel better. Yeah.
I hope we're doing the right thing.
we are. It's good that Aiden was so easy to convince,
and I think he's happy that he doesn't see ghosts anymore.
still, something just doesn't feel right.
I feel like something's missing.
it's probably just less stress in the house.
maybe more.
but I have to find it, mom!
we'll look for it later.
but he was the general! He was the main soldier.
if you had put your toys away like you' supposed to,
you'd be able to find them.
but the other soldiers won't know what to do without him.
Aiden, I don't want to hear anymore about it, OK?
it's just a toy soldier. - But it's not!
don't worry, I'll take him to the bus stop. Go ahead.
Thanks.
Oh, the drain. In the tub. It's clogged, sorry.
and you're telling me, why?
well, when you came back, I didn't want you...
cause it's my job to call the plumber?
no, I just...
every time something is broken in this house,
you just throw it at me like it's my job to get it fixed.
not really. But I'll call the plumber.
no, forget it! I'll call.
mom's in a bad mood.
you noticed that, too, did you?
come on.
I am so glad things are picking up.
3 open houses in one day?
we haven't seen that in months.
and I had to make the tremendous sacrifice
of taking a whole day off from school to help.
Oh, yeah, you're a real giver.
how's everything at the store?
I don't know.
you don't know?
closed up early today.
how come? - I hate that place.
what? - I hate it.
it's always so hot in there. I hate everything in it.
I'd be happy if I never had to step foot in that place again.
Mel, is everything OK?
Yeah!
Yeah, I'm gonna go see Jim. Hey, good luck on the open houses.
Bye.
it's all right, everybody has their days.
no, I just feel bad.
I shouldn't have snapped at you like that.
no, I'm amazed you're as even-tempered as you are,
all the stress you're usually under.
how about I take you to lunch to make up for it?
Yes, that's a good idea.
Yeah, I want to talk to you about all the weird stuff
that happened last night.
hospital's becoming ghost central again.
look, I'll file these, I'll be right back.
OK.
it's not nice to hide from your nurse.
maybe not. But it's fun.
what's your name? - Pete.
pistol Pete, everybody calls me.
I wonder why they call you that.
isn't the pediatric ward upstairs?
I just wanted to get something to drink.
my doctor said it was OK. But I forgot to take money.
all right. I'll make you a deal.
I will get you something to drink If you go back to room, ok?
deal.
Oh, I can't believe you fell for it!
you're a ghost.
no. Maybe you are.
Juanita.
I was looking all over for you.
honey, I hate to say it, but...
you look like you've just seen a ghost.
I did. But I didn't know it.
I've always been able to tell the difference
between the living and the dead.
their energy, the way that they look.
I feel it. I always know it.
I just don't understand why this is happening.
and it's not just that. I just...
I don't feel right lately.
I just don't know what to do.
Eli? Are you there?
root canal.
did you just suggest that I get a root canal?
no.
Eli, are you alright?
I have to have root canal. Have a toothache, might be fatal.
you know, toothaches are generally not fatal.
all right, Eli. Go to the dentist.
I have to pick up Aiden at the bus stop anyway.
I'll be more helpful when I'm not in excruciating pain,
or when I'm dead from the toothache.
well, I won't know the difference, so, bye.
this the house with the naughty drain?
Oh! Uh, did my husband call you?
Yep. Upstairs bathroom tub, right?
right.
george the plumber.
Oh, you probably don't want to shake hands
after the job I just came from.
so what are we looking at?
it's the bathtub drain.
Ah, I love a good clog. It's my specialty.
it's kind of like a mystery that you have to unravel.
tell the truth, I'm always a little disappointed
if it's just a garden-variety hairball.
Where's the challenge in that?
um, OK, let's get started, 'cause then I have to pick my son up. Down at the corner.
my work is guaranteed.
if I don't fix it, you don't pay.
that way, your money doesn't go down the drain.
a little plumber humor.
you hear that?
Ah, I'm so glad.
man, I've been hearing that every night. I thought I was going nuts.
where are we going, doc?
uh, nowhere. Um, nowhere.
I was just repositioning you a little bit.
we're all good.
did you find my soldier, mom?
no, I'm sorry.
I gotta find him!
we will. I know what's it's like to have lost something.
we need to talk.
come on, Aiden.
Melinda, I've been hearing things...
you need to know what... Melinda!
I don't get it.
they can do heart surgery with laser beams,
but to cure a toothache, You still have to sit in a torture chair
and let someone actually drill Into your tooth.
barbaric.
Yeah, I can see, this is not a good time. I just have one question.
why is Melinda ignoring me?
talking? Me talking?
I said something. To you?
no. Ok, who?
long hair, cute, um, pretty.
I said something to Melinda?
I hate that part.
what did I say?
um, eyes.
circle, symbol for no.
no eyes. No... no looking.
no... no seeing.
no... no seeing ghosts.
I told Melinda not to see ghosts.
but... small. Small... small person.
Aiden shouldn't see ghosts? I told Melinda that?
but I have no recollection of saying that!
anything like that. There's no way...
the shadows.
I told Melinda they've been in and out of my head lately.
what if they made me say that?
what if...
OK, just relax.
Eli, I don't know what's going on here, But I do know this...
convincing Aiden he can't see ghosts is the worst, the most dangerous thing Melinda can do right now.
it sounds like a classic poltergeist.
well, whatever this classic poltergeist is, he's gotta go.
cause of all the hauntings we've had in the hospital...
Sally stitch, the morgue ghost, none were this aggressive.
don't forget what the shadows did to Bedford's mother.
that was fairly aggressive.
wait, do you think this is shadow related?
no, I think it's a mischievous 13-year-old boy related.
OK. So you can cross him over?
I'll try, but the baby-sitter has to be home at midnight.
Ah, ghost hunting based on the baby-sitter's schedule.
that's what our lives have come to.
the price you pay for using living baby-sitters.
hilarious. Gotta go.
Bye.
Carl
no time now, tough ghost to cross over.
this is important. I never told you to get Aiden to stop seeing ghosts.
I would never tell you or anyone else to deny your gifts.
just back off. I've been warned.
I know what you're trying to do.
all right, maybe I was possessed by the shadows when I told you that...
if I told you that.
Really? Possessed? Is that then or now?
shadows can manipulate the living and the dead. You know that.
once they get in your head, they can make you say and do anything.
but this is me... the real me.
all right, the dead me. But still, me. Still Carl.
you are wasting your time.
the shadows don't want you crossing souls over.
and they don't want Aiden to follow in your footsteps.
you have powers that threaten what they can do.
you and Aiden see things other people can't,
so the shadows want to consume you both.
that's why this is the worst time to make Aiden deny his powers.
you're vulnerable now!
the shadows are going to use you to get to him.
you'll know when they start to get to you.
you'll feel your powers eroding.
already you're having trouble telling visions from reality.
who the hell do you think you are?
I am so sick of you and everyone else telling me what I'm supposed to do.
you don't decide what's best for me,
and you sure as hell don't decide what is best for Aiden!
I decide. Do you understand me? Me!
now go get a life of your own.
better yet, a death of your own, and leave me alone!
do you understand?
I just asked you a question. Do you understand?
please, please, can you help me?
I'm trying to find my doctor.
I don't know what's happening to me.
look, I'm not in the mood for this right now.
just look for a light. Get the hell in it.
stay in it, problem solved.
what... I... I...
you're not dead, are you? - Mr. Fordyce, come on.
time to go now, sir. Let's go. Right this way.
why does she think I'm dead? Do I look th bad?
you're annoying more people here than I am.
you know, this whole thing with your little posse has to stop.
who are those kids, anyway?
they're like my army.
they do whatever I say.
and I keep them safe.
the safest place for you is in the light.
you're funny.
Hey, how come you're the only one of them who can see us?
them who?
the people on the other side. The breathers.
that's what we call you people.
charming. Now what about your parents? Where are they?
they were so sad when they lost me.
they cried, And they cried...
don't you think they'd be happier if you crossed over Instead of staying here, causing trouble?
if you could get my parents to come and talk to me,
I'd do whatever they wanted.
where can I find them?
my dad owns the gas station in town.
you should be careful, though.
he doesn't like to talk about losing me.
it hurts his heart.
it's not my first barbecue. I'll try not to upset him.
Yeah, you're about a quart low.
well, maybe that's what my car's been trying to tell me.
Yeah. You almost gotta be a computer genius to own a car today.
you know, it used to be fun.
you know, figuring out what was wrong.
but now I just OK at a screen.
I've seen you around town, right?
Yeah, I own the antiques store down the street.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, my wife loves that place.
you've got more of my money than I do.
look, I don't want to pry,
but I was wondering if we could talk about your son.
my son? - Yeah, your boy.
Yeah, my wife and I can't have kids.
what's, uh, what's this about?
I'm sorry, I thought you had a son named Pete.
Pete's not my son.
but you know him?
who are you?
huh? Did they send you here?
what's he done now?
they? I don't...
we want nothing to do with that kid.
do you understand?
so you're not aware that Pete passed away?
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
um, oil's on the house.
his name was Pete Murphy.
he died at the hospital last month.
hodgkin's disease. He was 13.
Ugh, poor kid.
and the records said that he was sent to us from the Driscoll county youth home.
so he was an orphan?
Yeah. Which means This is another haunting involving orphans.
so it's probably shadow related?
makes perfect sense. I mean, what kids are more vulnerable Than those with no families?
and I can't reunite them with anyone.
now you said there were a lot of other kids?
Yeah, he said he was trying to keep them safe.
huh. From the shadows?
well, we know that they like to take ghost children, so probably.
and the guy that I met today,
it seemed like he was maybe a foster parent of Pete's at some point,
and it didn't work out so well.
so I guess Pete just created an image of loving parents in his mind.
makes you want to count your blessings, huh?
Yeah.
I'm gonna go there tomorrow and see if I can find out.
good.
Oh, hey, don't take a shower tomorrow morning.
the drain's still clogged, it's nasty.
I mention this only for informational purposes, not to...
Yeah, I know. Plumber told me he's going to have to come back again tomorrow, so.
I thought I saw my soldier under here.
but it was just this.
what are you doing up so late?
I gotta find him, mom. He was the general.
enough with the soldier already.
and if I find you out of bed again,
I'm gonna take all the soldiers away.
do you understand me, mister?
now get in the bed and don't move!
it's all right, buddy.
your mom's under a lot of stress right now, so, um...
go to bed, - I'm sorry, dad.
it's OK. Just get some sleep.
Yeah, I remember Pete.
pistol Pete. He was a force of nature.
he was a problem for you?
Oh, yeah. For everyone.
but you had to love him. And I did.
he was always riling up all the kids.
starting protests about the food, TV rebellions.
the kids all loved him because he made them feel important.
like what they wanted mattered.
at least one family adopted him.
more than one. But it was always the same story.
I mean, he'd get placed in a family. And within a month, he'd end up right back here.
he was just too much to handle.
and then he got sick?
Yeah.
they tried to take care of him here,
but eventually we had to put him in the hospital.
he was very alone in the world, pistol Pete.
what about his birth mother?
well, she gave him up the day he was born.
and she never looked back.
I really can't... - Can you just tell me where he was born?
same place he died. Rockland memorial.
this is the toughest case I've ever seen.
whatever's in there...
what is so hard about this, George?
I thought clogs were your specialty.
well, I think I may have met my Waterloo on this one.
is that supposed to be another plumber joke?
I guess it could be. Water. Loo.
just unclog the drain.
you're George the plumber, not George the comedian.
OK.
this is war! I will win!
ward
there was a polio ward for kids.
and the doctor there who gave them Halloween masks
let them play tricks on the other patients.
I guess it was to let them have some fun.
Yeah. When did it close?
1930s.
that's when they must have built the second floor
and the pediatric ward up there.
so where is the old one?
you know, there's an abandoned wing of the hospital Down in the subbasement.
I've never seen it; I've only heard about it.
everybody kind of steers clear of it.
everybody, except, of course, for maybe, right, you.
look, I can show it to you, but I've got to do some rounds right now.
well, just point me in the right direction.
the meter's running on our baby-sitter.
all right.
first right, down the stairs.
OK. - See ya.
don't you know you're dead?
I beg your pardon?
we're not scared of you.
we know you can't hurt us.
why would I want to hurt you?
it's OK.
she's just one of the breathers.
she thinks she's alive.
welcome to my lair.
I've always wanted to have a lair.
what's going on with you and these kids?
I made them all believe they're alive.
they think the doctors and nurses are the ghosts.
and now, you. - Why?
I want them to feel like they're important.
let them feel what it's like to have some juice.
this is wrong.
I know you mean well, but you're not helping them like this.
they need to cross over, and so do you.
I protect them.
from the shadows?
the cold things. They want us.
if it wasn't for me, they would have taken everybody here already.
and how do you keep them safe?
I teach them not to be afraid.
that's why we march around the hospital Twice a day, every day.
we show them who's boss.
this is more dangerous than you know, Pete.
especially for you.
look, we don't know why, But the shadows, they go after ghost children.
I know your story.
I've been to the youth home, I know that they kept sending you back.
I know how painful it must be to...
no, you don't.
how would you like it if nobody wanted you?
if all anybody ever saw was the bad in you,
and they couldn't wait to get rid of you.
I'm no good.
that's why nobody wants me.
you're not bad. That's not...
even my own mother didn't want me.
you don't know that.
you think I couldn't break into file cabinets?
I know.
I got you. Again.
nobody loves me.
poor me.
this is my family now.
they're never going to send me back.
we're never going to split up.
this is our hospital!
did you get the book... Sorry.
did you get the book from Ned?
you look terrible.
by the way, I noticed that dentist had hairy arms.
just an observation.
well, chalk up another advantage to being dead.
no dental work and no more flossing.
OK, the book. Let's see.
please, what do I have to do to convince you people?
do you want me to recount every embarrassing thing I know about you
that the shadows couldn't?
like the time I came to talk to you and you were on that website?
OK. All right.
see if you can find anything in the book that can help us.
new things, added things.
what I think is happening is this...
the shadows want Melinda and Aiden,
but for some reason, they're leaving Aiden alone.
which makes me wonder if this has something to do with the shinies.
the shinies are drawn to Aiden for some reason,
and the shadows hate them.
if we only knew what or who the shinies really are,
then maybe we could enlist them to protect Melinda.
it's only a matter of time before Melinda's weak enough for the shadows to control her completely.
and where will that leave Aiden?
what?
and the darkness will come and swallow them all,
unless the family of light turns night into day.
well, we're going to sit down for dinner now,
so if you're not done, you can just finish tomorrow.
no, no, I'm almost done, I promise.
I will be victorious.
anyway. I think this is my only chance to cross Pete over.
honey, you are never going to find the birth mother.
those records are sealed.
not even the adopted family can get into them.
sometimes the impossible just takes a little bit longer.
I just wish I could explain this to his birth mother.
if she came with me to see Pete and told him that she loved him and wanted him and why she couldn't have kept him,
if she just told him the reasons for letting him go,
I know that he would cross over.
honey, you've got a big heart.
I know you want a happy ending for this boy.
but didn't the orphanage tell you straight out
that the mother didn't even want him?
if you find her, what, do you want her to lie to him?
if it makes him feel loved? Yes.
are you even going to touch this?
I just don't feel well.
Wow. You're burning up. Let me take your temperature.
no, no, no, I'm fine. As soon as George is done upstairs I'm gonna go to bed.
you know, I'm so over this plumber. Where did you find him, anyway?
I thought you found him.
I thought you called him.
I never called any plumber. You said you were going to call him.
I've never even seen this guy.
you're dead!
you say that like it's a bad thing.
you totally took advantage of me.
how do you know that I can't tell the dead from the living right now?
word gets around.
there's more gossip than you might think on the other side.
the dead should be above that kind of thing.
I'm sorry.
look, I'm just so happy to have a job again.
I love my work.
but you can't actually do anything.
well, pretty much the same as when I was alive.
get out! Just get out!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Look, I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
let me try to make it up to you.
I hope that helps!
I'm worried about my mom.
there's something not right with her.
I see lots of shadows around her.
why can't you guys make the shadows leave my mom alone?
we're too scared of them.
they're really mean.
whom were you talking to?
a ghost. Don't tell my mom.
I won't. But if you were talking to a ghost, how come I couldn't see it?
it was my friend Cassidy.
she crossed over, and now she's a shiny.
that's who shinies are?
crossed over spirits of children?
no wonder the shadows are so interested in child ghosts.
the shinies are scared of the shadows, but they don't have to be.
why not?
there are way more shinies than shadows.
if they ever had a war, the shinies would win.
Aiden, that's...
OK. Found this in the drain.
wow, thanks!
keep track of your toys in the tub, OK?
lucky break that I didn't have to pay a plumber to come and get that out.
OK, mom.
Hey, I think I found something. - Oh, yeah?
says here there's a woman who gave birth
on the same day that Pete was born.
and then she gave the baby up for adoption on the spot
and left the hospital. It was pre-arranged.
is there a name and an address?
the last name and address are blacked out. It just says "Joan.
hold on. Ah, look, business address and occupation.
she owned a beauty salon.
but that was 13 years ago.
Hey, it's worth a shot.
look, I'm going to start by saying that I have no right to be here,
and I've probably broken a couple of laws just finding you.
but I need your help.
you don't look like you need a haircut that bad.
or are you going to tell me I have 6 months to live?
did you give a child up for adoption
january 18th, 1997, Rockland memorial hospital?
who are you?
I know this must be a shock to you, but please, just hear me out.
what do you want?
if I were to tell you that you have an opportunity
to help this child right now. Would you take it?
and I'm not talking about taking custody, or taking responsibility.
I'm not talking about money.
but it would require a pretty big leap of faith on your part.
is... Is she in some kind of trouble or something?
no, no, not...
did you say,"she"?
Yes. Aren't we talking about my daughter?
the child you gave up was a girl?
I am really sorry. I have the wrong person.
I... I'm so sorry.
wait.
I don't know why I'm telling you this. Except...
you seem like you're really trying to help someone.
I am. Well, we are. My wife and I.
there was a woman in the same room with me that day.
she gave birth 2 hours before me. A boy.
and did she... - and she died while giving birth.
there was no family, no one came, so the state took custody,
and the baby was sent to the same orphanage as my little girl,
on the same day.
that's all I remember.
Pete's mother did not give him up for adoption, Mel.
there must have been a records mix-up later on.
she died giving birth.
she had no family, and there was no one to take care of Pete.
so the state put him in an orphanage.
listen to what else.
she was sick, right? There was a dangerous pregnancy.
she told the doctors straight up that if anything bad were to happen,
they should save Pete, Even if it meant letting her die.
so not only did she not give him up,
she sacrificed her life for his.
OK, well, that's good to know. Thanks for telling me.
well, I thought that this would make you happy...
I gotta go.
Melinda's not here.
want to play chess?
hmm. Maybe later.
right now we need to talk about your mom.
she's in trouble.
she needs help, or she...
well, she may not ever be the same again.
what kind of help?
do you remember when you said if there was a war with the shadows,
the shinies would win?
well, it's time for that war.
but the shinies need a leader; a general,
someone who was meant to bring them together.
someone like you.
why me?
I think it's what the book is trying to tell us.
and the shinies are all children.
who better to lead them than you?
well, what if I'm scared?
what if I'm not brave enough?
even brave people get scared.
do you think your mom's not scared sometimes?
she is. So am I.
but what makes a person brave Is not letting their fears stop them.
tell me what I have to do.
Jim, something's wrong with Melinda.
she's locked herself in the store.
she won't answer the phone, she won't talk to anyone.
dad?
you need to take me to where mom is,
or something really bad is going to happen to her.
wait here, dad, I have to do this myself.
mom?
I am not your mother.
I know that, and I want her back.
I'm giving you one more chance to leave her alone.
we're busy.
look, Aiden... hey.
it's all right, dad. I know what to do.
I need all the shinies to come, right now.
they're too afraid. I'm too afraid.
it's a school play, and he's rehearsing.
it's OK. We're going to make the shadows go away forever. Right now.
how?
we're going to turn night into day.
take my hand.
that makes me feel strong. You are strong.
hold out your other hand.
how can a local school afford that?
Hey, baby. Hey, baby, you all right?
I'm fine. - Ok.
Where's Aiden?
Oh, baby.
you are my hero.
you're my hero.
mommy's all right now, you made the shadows let go of me.
I love you, mommy.
my mother wanted me?
so much that she told the doctor
if he could only save one of you, to save you.
she gave her life for yours.
that's how much you were loved.
it's time to cross over now, you don't belong here.
I can't just leave them.
they're still my family.
so, just take them with you.
and you can all stay together.
Yeah, but...
they're gonna know I lied about them not being dead.
they'll know that you care about how they felt.
that's all that will matter.
I see it.
it's so bright.
your mom's probably there.
waiting for you.
she looks just like me.
your mother and I want you to know
that you were right not to give up on our gift.
it's who you are, and it's who your mother is, and we should never...
I should never deny that again.
we call it a gift for a reason.
it allows us to be able to help people in ways...
in ways that others can't.
and we have to respect that.
learn from it.
take care of it.
and never hide it from each other again, OK?
deal?
deal.
good night, son.
I meant what I said, you know.
you were my hero tonight.
just like you are, mom.
every day.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I'm married, I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here, because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
besides...
what?
what...
wait...
are you sure the guy you saw was talking to a ghost, not just talking to himself, and the ghost was
I know what I saw. They were interacting, ok？
ghost to human, human to ghost.
well, that means there's someone else out there.
like me. I know.
OK, there's always been my grandmother and my mom with whatever abilities she has, but I have always wondered what it would be like to have a friend who saw what I saw, who felt what I felt.
well, I mean, this is weird, Mel.
what are the chances that there are 2 people like in Grandview?
I know, which is why I'm all questions right now, and I have to talk to this guy.
I'm gonna go back to that funeral home tomorrow and see if they at least have a guest book that I can look at.
I'm never gonna sleep tonight.
what?
who are you?
wait. I remember you.
you were on the plane.
I made a mistake.
I know.
you didn't cross over.
don't let them find me.
we call it the Harold and Maude syndrome, from the movie.
people who hang around wakes and funerals.
so have you ever seen him before?
I've seen him a bunch of times, at the cemetery, too.
um, has he ever spoken to you?
once or twice. Nice guy.
seems harmless.
damn.
would you mind?
so what did he say to you?
Oh, you know, the usual questions.
did I know I was dead?
how did I die?
do I know other dead people?
blah, blah, blah.
I said, look, I like it here.
I have no intention of leaving.
you wanna be a do-gooder, go help that confused old lady over there who doesn't even know she's dead, poor thing.
could I check your guest book?
sure.
so does he ever know the people who are being waked?
I don't think so.
and it's usually young ones.
he never pays much attention to the old people.
I just don't get all this fascination with the dead.
for me, it's almost like being alive, except a lot less expensive, and I never get asked for directions.
that alone was almost worth keeling over for.
can I help you with something?
uh, I realized that I forgot to sign the book yesterday, so.
look at that.
done.
you should be ashamed of yourself, buster.
when I ran this place, there was never one crooked tie.
I am sick of doing your job, sick of it.
close your mouth.
I don't know that I can.
I recommend it for your next class.
how are you not jumping out of your skin over this?
I don't know anything about this guy, ok?
he could be a friend or a foe. It could be a hoax.
hoax? Hoax?
Melinda, listen to yourself.
you sound just like all those frightened little people that have doubted you your whole life.
you were one of those not too long ago.
I'm a scientist. It's my job to doubt you and be frightened all the time.
that's my job. And quite frankly, when I doubted you, my life was a lot simpler.
doubt was my friend.
doubt was your crutch.
are we gonna find this ghost guy, or are we gonna write bumper stickers?
I'm trying to find him, but I don't know anything else except his name is Gabriel, and he likes to hang out at funeral homes and cemeteries.
Oh, great.
so he doesn't have a lot of colorful clothing.
that narrows it down. What else?
why would a guy like this pop up in Grandview?
I don't know, but I wanna find out.
maybe you guys were meant to find each other for some reason.
for what reason?
maybe you have to find him cheerier hobbies.
OK, look, in case this guy turns out to be the real deal, will you just look this stuff up for me, ok?
same ability, same place, same time.
Yes, I will, but listen.
the second you find this guy, you bring him right here immediately.
do you understand?
that's exactly what I'll do.
were you being sarcastic?
was that sarcasm.
thank you so much. - You're welcome.
Hey, good morning.
sorry I'm late.
is everything ok?
Yeah, I was just a little distracted. How are you?
good.
Hey, you know, we never really got a chance to talk about what happened yesterday.
weird, huh?
so you're saying that the ghost of Jake's wife was at the wake, like literally in the room.
Yeah.
ghosts usually go to their wakes and funerals.
they like to see who came, check out what they look like.
hair, clothing, the whole deal.
Really?
Uh-huh.
and you actually have conversations like we're having right now?
Delia, why are you asking me this?
you know that it makes you crazy.
it's just that when I think about ghosts and, you know, stuff like that,
I imagine them to be kind of cloudy, transparent people dragging chains, you know.
I get some of those, too, believe me.
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.
I need help. I have to get out of here.
who are you? You're not the one who can help me.
I can help you, but you have to let me.
there's a better place for you.
I can help you get there, but you have to want it.
she's the one.
she's the one who can help me.
Oh, hi.
didn't see you standing there.
you must think I'm crazy.
sometimes I talk to myself.
good way to get locked up, right?
do you see the light?
do you see it?
I'm not sure.
there's something in the way.
I can't get close.
are you sure that there are not people waiting for you, like family or
no. They're not.
tell me what you can see.
Hey, you can't just walk off like that.
what do you want? Who are you?
my name is Melinda Gordon. Who are you?
sorry, I have to go.
look, you know what?
you and me have something that we need to talk about, don't you think?
so where did you live before you came here?
Denver.
Yeah, a small neighborhood called Rosemont.
when my parents died, my uncle john took me in.
we traveled all over, every corner of the world.
did your uncle know?
no, no.
I realized pretty fast that this was something I had to keep to myself, and so stopped trying, learned to live with it.
besides, I didn't care if people understood me.
you know, I never really trusted the living anyway.
the dead made much better friends.
so did you have, uh, regular dead friends?
Absolutely.
when I was a kid, I'd invite my ghost friends for sleepovers.
Yeah, I took 'em with me to school, camping, trips.
I'd cry when they would finally cross over.
I wished they would stay with me forever.
I was afraid to acknowledge them.
I...I mean, not the ghosts, but I was afraid what other people would think.
me, too.
you tell people anything, all right-- you're a thief, uh, you have a contagious disease, you know the meaning of life
but nothing quite matches the look you get when you say you can see ghosts, right?
exactly.
it's like people always think that you're after something.
are you after something, Gabriel?
I mean, come on.
the two of us living in the same town.
it's a little weird. You have to admit it.
maybe, but I have a different weird threshold than most.
well, don't you?
have you noticed a shift in the spirit world?
is this a test?
maybe.
uh, actually, I have, like they're getting stronger.
you felt it, too?
Yeah. They can do more.
it's like they can affect us in ways they couldn't before.
like the flight attendant.
look, when that plane came down, there was a very dark spirit here who was trying to get as many souls as possible to stay earthbound.
he was able to convince a lot of souls, including her, that they belonged here, that there was something they were meant to do.
now she's terrified of crossing over.
I just think she doesn't know who to trust.
there's something keeping her from crossing.
maybe she could talk to me again, you know, now that I know us. Maybe she could talk to us.
I'm not trying to take over your corner.
I don't have a corner.
I just have history with this spirit.
well, strength in numbers.
are you gonna get that?
Yes, yes.
I met him.
Yep. He was at our house.
seems great.
funny, smart.
Yeah, yeah. And he's a double capricorn.
he likes long walks on the beach.
skip the personal ad.
is he the real deal or not?
I think so.
so what do you guys talk about?
just compare notes, talk shop?
in a way.
I don't know if I can totally trust him yet.
you know, I have a weird thing about coincidences.
you're so suspicious. I love that about you.
then again, that's what I love about me, so.
we're gonna go back to where it all started, plane crash site tomorrow night, see if we can find the flight attendant.
tomorrow night.
you're not thinking of going out with her tomorrow night, are you?
I can't go tomorrow night. I have a lecture.
Oh, good, 'cause you're not invited.
well, good, 'cause you're not invited, either.
I'll let you know how it goes. Good night.
good night.
it's weird being up here again.
think she'll be here?
I like to go back to the beginning, where they died.
sort of like me in that way
go after them, try to help 'em.
I don't exactly go after them.
they usually come to me.
I like finding them.
I like chasing them, too.
sometimes I compete with myself, how many can I send off in one night.
your husband's a good man.
he understands you.
Yeah. I'm very lucky.
never known anyone I could trust that way.
I'm not going back.
where?
to that place with those people.
I think it was hell or something.
are there spirits still blocking the light?
maybe you have some unfinished business or someone who you need to say good-bye to.
there's no one.
you must have some family.
I never wanted any of that.
how about your parents?
they wanted me to be just like them, to never leave, and I wouldn't, so now they hate me.
no, they don't.
they do, because I left, and I died.
Amy, I know what it's like to be alone, to have no attachments, no one pulling on your heart.
you and I are more alike than you know.
there's a difference between being lonely and being alone, am I right?
you just have to decide that you don't wanna be alone like that anymore, and whatever blocks the light now will move.
Amy, I can show you a place where you'll be very happy.
who's that?
please don't let them find me.
stop it! He's my friend!
look, I'm sorry.
I...I didn't mean to scare you off.
I just-- I couldn't resist.
what the hell is this?
it's a Kirkland camera.
it measures auras. It's nothing.
that's property of the university.
is this some kind of a joke, huh?
some kind of cheap trick?
look, I didn't know he was gonna be here, I swear.
now you know why I prefer the dead.
you're not gonna believe what I saw.
I can't believe you followed me.
what are you, 12?
it was in the name of science.
listen, my lecture let out at 5: 00, so do you have any idea what this makes me look like?
Yeah, tell me about it.
I was running like a girl, holding this camera. I fell down.
that guy grabbed me, and he almost
thank goodness he didn't break this camera, 'cause this thing is not cheap, and I am.
did you notice he's got quite a temper on him?
Yeah. You always seem to bring out the best in people.
Yeah, I consider myself sort of like a truth serum, except without the needles or the C. I.A.
all right, luckily, I always keep a backup.
you remember our friend, Kirkland camera?
Yeah. It reads auras.
energy fields, like the kinds your friends the spirits give off.
here you go.
would you like to guess what those are?
um, spirits.
Yeah. Spirits. Spirits!
this place is lousy with 'em!
Yeah. It's a haunted field.
there are lots of spirits that didn't cross over in the plane crash.
Oh, well, how come Kirkland can see them all and you can't?
you know why? Because that sees energy, and spirits can choose to manifest.
I can't make them show themselves.
all right. Really?
well, uh, why don't you take a closer look.
here you go.
look at these orbs around him.
they follow him wherever he goes.
they're attached to him.
when--when he chased me, they came with him.
look at that. Those are his ghosts.
I came to apologize for last night.
I sort of, uh, lost it, and, um, I want us to start over again.
there's something I want you to see first.
they're spirits.
attached to you.
how do you know they're not attached to you?
stop playing with me.
why don't you trust me?
I don't know why.
but you don't.
why did you come to Grandview?
did you know that I was here?
I came here because I felt I had to be here.
I was drawn here.
maybe it was you.
or maybe it was them.
maybe it's just because I feel I can help here.
look, we have to work together.
all right, we were both put here for a reason.
we have to find out what it is.
how?
find your flight attendant, and we need to know what she sees on her side.
if you wanna work with me, meet me tonight at the funeral home at 9: 00.
maybe I was too hard on Gabriel.
I mean, he does try to help spirits.
he even goes and looks for them, unlike me, who tries to avoid them whenever I can.
that's because he doesn't have anything else.
who am I to judge him.
or not to trust him?
do you have any idea who this guy really is?
have you checked on him?
there's no phone listing.
not here, before that, uh, before Grandview.
didn't he, uh--didn't he say something about Denver?
Yeah. He said he lived with his uncle.
he told me his name, but.
right. Right.
there's only one John Lawrence, and he's a doctor and the director at rosemont hospital.
that's where Gabriel said he lived.
I--I realize it's just about quitting time where you are, but I really need to speak to dr. Lawrence.
it's urgent that I speak with him.
I promise that I'll be very brief.
I thought so.
thank you, yes.
I will hold.
isn't it a little late?
I'm sorry. It'll just be a minute.
isn't this what you have an office？- Thank you.
uh, dr. Lawrence.
Yes. Who is this?
uh, my name is professor Richard Payne, Rockland University.
your nephew Gabriel Lawrence applied for a job here in my building, so I wanted to call and ask you some questions, just so I could fill in some of the blanks on his application.
I don't have a nephew.
well, that's--that's not what my papers here tell me.
it says Gabriel Lawrence is your nephew.
he's mid-twenties, he's dark, and you raised him from the time he was 9 years old.
I think you might be talking about Gabriel Hastings.
he's not my nephew.
he was my patient.
sorry, did you say,"patient"?
this is a psychiatric hospital.
he came to us as a child.
he basically grew up here.
I really shouldn't say too much.
with all due respect, doctor,
I think I have every right in the world to know whether or not the person I'm about to hire is dangerous.
he was severely delusional as a child, came a long way, and he was released to his own custody when he became an adult.
that's really all I can say.
please tell him to call me.
will do. Thank you. Bye-bye.
so much for uncle John.
Hey, what's the matter?
that could have been me
severely delusional, kid that sees ghosts.
I wonder how many people there are like that, you know, who just get put away because of what they can do.
Melinda, this is nothing like you, ok?
this guy went psycho because he saw ghosts.
I know. I just don't know what to believe.
and I have to talk to him,'cause maybe I can help him.
no.
no, I forbid it.
no, you cannot. This isn't a stray dog, Melinda.
this guy's trouble, ok?
let's take a break. I'm thirsty.
I'm really thirsty.
who wants a drink?
not me.
I will.
he's very concerned about you.
I remember when he used to be that concerned about me.
must've lasted, oh, at least the first few weeks of our marriage.
Mmm, I'm sorry, but it's really not what it seems.
it's all right.
doesn't really matter now anyway.
so what's our next step?
you know, this is really none of my business, but why didn't you tell me your wife was dead?
because I don't deal with it very well.
maybe it's time to.
what happened to her?
it's nothing. She died in her sleep.
that is him.
I was killed driving past a construction site.
a crane collapsed onto my car.
I was trapped for over 2 hours, and I died just before they cut me free, but.
it's too tough for him to think about.
she's here.
Why?
I kept a journal.
third shelf behind the textbooks. He--he should read it.
she has a journal, third shelf.
she wants you to read it.
I knew it.
I just knew it.
things have been moving around for months, and I--I hear her.
I smell her perfume when I come home sometimes.
just make sure he reads it.
there are things he should know.
she's gone.
she really wants you to read that journal, ok?
you call me if you need to.
help me.
Hey, glad you made it.
so much that's about to happen.
it's a great party, huh?
miss, please.
where you been?
you're the only reason I wish I wasn't dead.
I'm not crossing over!
party!
so how long you been dead?
you stood me up.
what is this?
what are you doing with all these spirits?
having fun.
they're my family.
you can't do this. You can't just keep them all trapped here.
trapped?
they're anything but trapped.
they're more free than they've ever been.
you lied to me.
did I?
Yeah. I spoke to your uncle John, who was never your uncle.
so what?
you would lie, too, in my place.
no, I wouldn't.
come on, Melinda.
this thing we do makes us liars.
you lie every single day, every time you make an excuse for why you're talking to yourself or when you backpedal to explain how you know something you shouldn't or when you're looking right at somebody that no one else can see.
lying is second nature to us.
lying is survival.
is that what got you out of the institution?
you bet your ass it is.
look, I'm sorry.
I'm not like you.
I didn't grow up with a family like yours.
I don't have a partner like you have.
my support system was a tray of meds to make it all go away.
look, you owe it to them to cross them over.
and you owe it to the families.
don't tell me what I owe the living.
there has never been one living person who made me feel I was worth anything, who made me feel I wasn't just some nut to be locked away.
I'm here for the dead, not the living.
they know they can trust me, and they know I trust them.
this isn't just some lonely hearts club, Melinda.
we're getting ready.
for what? - For what's coming.
we're blocking the light, and soon no one's gonna get through.
these aren't your grandmother's ghosts anymore.
we're kindred souls, you and I, 2 sides of the same coin.
just imagine how powerful we'd be if we linked up.
or you could just risk losing everything.
what are you saying?
I want you to leave your life.
why do you think we met?
you said it yourself.
this can't be an accident.
please take me out of here.
do you see a light?
no.
well, look for it.
you have to want it.
I see it.
there are still people in front of it.
I can't get close.
I think that's because you're scared and confused.
they're using it against you.
so what do I do?
can you think of anybody, like a grandparent or friend who might still be in the light?
I've never really lost anyone.
even my dog is still alive.
uh, ok. Well, you know what?
um, why don't you think of yourself as a little girl, 8 or 9, you know. Maybe
maybe it's your birthday party.
we always had a birthday party.
with your parents?
Yeah, my aunts and uncles.
do they make you feel safe and loved?
Yeah. I looked forward to it all day.
they're all watching me now.
they're smiling at me.
do you feel like nothing bad could ever happen to you?
Yeah, like they're always gonna keep me safe.
they loved me so much.
they can't block you when you feel those things.
you're right. They're starting to move.
the light's getting bigger.
so there's nothing stopping you now.
go into it.
it is so beautiful.
now I can see everything there is to see.
OK.
crossed her over going 60, and never took my foot off the gas.
how's that for your grandmother's ghost, Gabriel?
you're not gonna believe what happened to me tonight.
it ain't over yet.
it was right where she said it would be. Feel free to read aloud.
almost told him tonight, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
should I just leave without saying anything or just leave a note?
will he even notice?
I keep waiting for him to tell me that he knows about the affair.
could it be he actually doesn't? Is he that unconscious?
it gets better.
I am so sorry.
I don't understand the appeal of this unfinished business.
I think I would have been all right without that piece of closure.
it's like everything has just turned upside down.
Gabriel had something to do with this?
I went to Gabriel's house tonight, and he had like this
I don't know.
army of souls at some never-ending party.
I knew the ghosts that were there, 'cause they hadn't crossed over.
was Kate there?
I didn't see her.
but there were others, you know, from the plane crash, even before that.
ghosts from the past?
Yes.
when the forgotten return.
death will be twice closer.
uh, hello. Translation?
it's the 5 signs the dead dove on the doorstep.
the bee.
writing on Jim's back.
what is it, Mel?
the dead will walk.
and now the forgotten have returned.
wait. So all 5 of those things have happened.
no, not all of them. Not the writing on your back, "Mors Dilecti." It was Latin.
it translates to "death of a loved one."
OK, you know what? We have to go and talk to Gabriel.
you think Kate will be there?
I don't know, but he better tell us what's going on.
upstairs.
in here.
he's been watching you this whole time.
couple of pictures of you up here, Jim.
few of me.
I've always hated that picture of me.
he's been planning this for quite some time.
this is bigger than just him.
I hear someone.
what are you doing here?
she's here?
he used me.
who did?
Gabriel, all of them.
where did they go?
I don't know, but they left me here.
Why?
because I feel so bad about what I did.
I should never have hurt you like that, Rick.
I shouldn't have told you about the diary, but they wanted me to.
she's saying that Gabriel wanted her to hurt you.
he wants to hurt everybody who helps you.
Why?
he wants to make you weak.
why is he collecting souls?
why does he want them to stay earthbound?
it's not just him.
it's happening all over.
they're planning something.
who is?
everyone on this side.
what do they want?
they want to make the dead stronger than the living.
they want to take over.
what's happening, Melinda? What is she saying?
wait. She'll tell you.
I never meant for it to be this way, Rick.
I'm sorry. Would you tell him I'm sorry?
she's saying that she's sorry.
Gabriel wanted her to hurt you because you're close to me.
so it was all a lie, then, the journal and the affair.
no.
no, that's true, and I'm sorry.
is that the only reason she haunted me?
no.
no, not at first.
just moving things around, making noises,
I just felt like
I was getting more of your attention dead than I did when I was alive.
I just
I just wanted you to know how lonely I felt.
how much I loved you and needed you and hated losing you.
and then.
Gabriel found me, told me that I was gonna be punished for what I'd done if i tried to cross over.
he said I should stay here and help him.
he said then the pain would go away.
what is she saying now?
she was haunting you because she wanted you to pay attention, and she knows that she made a mistake, and she feels terrible about it, and that's why Gabriel left her behind.
how did we let it get to this, Rick?
I did love you.
I know you love me.
I--I know you did.
how did we lose that?
will you.
will you forgive me?
she wants to know if you can forgive her.
it's what she needs to find peace and cross over.
no.
what?
no.
I could say it, but I'd be lying.
I could say the words if that's what you want.
you'll never get another chance like this.
you have to know that.
no. No.
she should have come to me. We should've spoken about it.
she was with another man, Melinda. I just.
there's too much pain.
no.
tell him.
you tell him he doesn't know what pain is.
none of you do.
but you all will.
she's gone now, isn't she?
I wouldn't be so sure.
my name is melinda gordon.
I'm married,
I live in a small town, and I own an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except that from the time I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
they're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living and they come to me for help.
in order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.
so...
this is really, really great.
out in nature, no one but us for miles.
who knew that camping could be so much fun.
What'd I tell you?
the clean air. The smell.
there's nothing like it.
Yeah. I'm getting that feeling.
I'm just glad you came this time, ok?
besides, I thought when you said we were going to the woods, you meant the woods.
that place where Delia always wants to take you to?
Yeah. Salt scrubs, seaweed wraps, massages.
that would be the one.
Pushaw! Uhh!
besides, we got all the luxury right here.
Ahh. And these hands, they got more magic in them than any seafood wrap.
seaweed.
Oh, right. That's it.
Ahh. Yep.
Ahh. This place hasn't changed a bit.
you used to come out here with your father?
Yeah.
me, my brother and my old man.
no mom?
no. She loved camping about as much as you do.
Hey! Ha ha.
Oh, no.
sorry. The wood probably was just green.
all right.
Oh!
why don't you...
I'll go.
this the crisp air you were talking about?
did I forget to mention? --ahh.
we might get a little weather.
zip it.
Hey, do you hear that?
hmm? Crickets.
not that.
Lanie. -- That.
Hello?
somebody out there?
come out.
Hello?
crap.
Oh, where is it?
where is it?
Hey. No, no, no. It's ok.
it's ok, it's ok.
you all right?
Oh, I'm so glad it's you.
I'm glad I saw your light because when I woke up and you weren't in bed, I almost freaked out.
sorry. I heard something.
a woman's voice.
I found this.
that's been there for a while.
Yeah. Look at this.
the, uh...the moldy sippy cup?
no. No, there was a there was a creepy baby doll.
a baby doll.
the woman's voice, it sounded desperate, and I don't know. I just feel like maybe I should stay in case she comes back.
no.
I think she knows where you're staying.
we're the only ones up here for miles.
OK. You're right. If she needs me, she'll find me.
Yeah. Come on. Let's go and get some sleep.
I got some plans for tomorrow.
come out, come out, wherever you are.
Hello?
don't be afraid.
I wanna help you.
morning, sunshine.
it's disgusting how cheerful you are in the morning.
well, you sleep much deeper out here in the fine air.
speak for yourself.
Ah. Breakfast smells so good. I'm starving.
Yeah. Breakfast was about 4 hours ago.
this would be lunch.
just tell me there's coffee.
all right.
do I sense a less than perfect night's sleep?
well, between the ghosts, stinking air
air mattress, I didn't sleep all night.
she came back? Why didn't you wake me up?
cause I didn't have any dynamite?
you know, it's weird.
she made the doll appear in the fire.
that's creepy.
what's the message?
I don't know. Stay away?
she's done everything she can to get rid of us, even that weird windstorm.
you know, I'm sorry.
I hope I haven't tainted this place for you.
no. I feel sorry for your ghost.
Yeah. That hide and seek song she keeps singing makes me think she's looking for a child.
well, that would explain why she's so territorial.
she's trying to say something else. I just don't know what.
yummy. I'm starving.
you're going to need it.
Oh? -- I was thinking that we'd go on a little hike.
a hike sounds nice.
might have to make a small detour.
Oh, come on. You got to admit, this is kind of exciting.
Ah, I don't know. To me, a swimming hole's exciting.
haunted, rusty cars, not so exciting.
it doesn't look like there was an accident.
maybe they just ran off the road.
but there is no road here.
Aha. There used to be.
the main road used to run through the pass till the forest service took over and made this all a reserve.
look at you with that thing.
maybe this was a side road.
well, how long ago was that?
I don't know. My dad and I first started coming out here about 20 years ago.
car's been here at least that long.
I think I found a registration.
only thing I can make out is Anna.
well, it's a first name anyway.
Hey, do you think you can trace this license when you get back to work?
I can do better than that.
I can request a history of all 911 calls made out of the region.
I can do that if we get out of here now because I'd really like to make it to the falls by dark.
last one there gets pushed down!
Oh, um, there's some really great vintage baby rattles over there.
Thanks. I'm just waiting on a friend.
OK.
these alabaster lamps are really hard to find.
you've got a good eye.
no. Absolutely not.
that skateboard park is an accident waiting to happen.
you sure grant's mom is going to be there?
is my receipt in the bag?
can you just put her on the phone?
what? What do you mean she's not there? -- Here's your receipt.
no solvents. Just some soap and water and, something for your next purchase.
thank you. -- Thank you.
OK, fine, but if I find out that you didn't wear a helmet, you are dead.
Yes. I love you, too.
I am so sorry.
that woman is never coming back again, is she?
Oh, I think she will. I gave her a 20% off coupon.
you definitely don't miss a trick.
thanks for covering for me.
anytime. Was that Ned?
Yeah.
I always thought I'd worry about him less as he grew up, but I worry about him more.
you know, at this rate, I won't stop worrying about him until I'm dead.
if you're lucky.
chances are, I'll still be worrying from my grave. -- Lanie!
it sounds like I chose a bad time to leave you. Come out, come out, wherever you are! -- With the store.
Oh, no. Just the opposite.
it was great to take my mind off the little daredevil.
so, was camping as dreadful as you thought it would be?
actually, it was kind of exciting.
it was good for Jimmy and I to have some time alone.
Aha. Fess up. Do I detect a little biological alarm clock going off?
uh, ooh. No, nothing like that. Mm-mmm.
come on. You can tell me.
I know I gripe, but motherhood rocks.
you are going to love it.
I'm sure I will. Can you just excuse me for a second?
what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to see your adorable baby, and, oh, my god. She's so cute.
Thanks.
it's like she's testing me, trying to see if she can trust me.
you think this ghost is a worried mom looking for her kid.
Yeah, but I didn't realize until today how intense that feeling is.
wait a minute.
what happened today?
I just had a couple of anxious moms at the store. Delia being one.
please tell me that this is not the same stove that you used with your dad.
Yes, miss change the subject.
that is the same stove I used with my father.
and it works like new.
I got a little something for you.
that's the trace, with an address for one Anna Fowler.
you traced the license already?
Yep. That's how I roll.
it expired in '86.
that's probably around when she died.
well, we'll know that for sure when the 911 trace comes back, which will probably take a couple of weeks, because anything more than 10 years old is in the main archives.
you're my hero. This is brookside. It's close.
don't get too excited.
anybody who lives in that house probably never heard of Anna Fowler.
well, I have a secret weapon.
Delia can trace real estate transactions for me.
you know, one of these days she is going to get suspicious.
Yeah, and one of these days, I'm going to have to do something about it.
woman's voice: Come out, come out, wherever you are.
uh, you know, I'll be right back.
can you throw this thing in the trash for me?
Yeah, sure.
Anna, I can't help you if you won't talk to me.
are you looking for someone?
I have to find her.
who do you have to find?
my baby girl.
she's lost.
can you tell me what happened?
I...I was cold.
Mel, where'd you put the, um...
I scared her away, didn't I?
Yeah.
but she left us something.
Lanie was a baby she must dead too.
I really shouldn't be doing this.
you said you wanted to keep a foot in real estate.
Yes, to make money, but not to snoop on other people's records.
well, it's for a good cause.
a little girl's missing her doll.
well, she wouldn't be a little girl anymore if we're looking at records this far back.
OK. Here it is.
the house was sold in 1991 and the owner's name was Brad Fowler.
does it say anything else about him?
like what, he's a gemini and likes long walks on the beach?
I mean, like his occupation.
uh...he was a therapist.
Hey, maybe you can kill two birds with one stone.
you're hilarious. Thank you.
sure.
I just thought you'd like to know that the car was found.
this is, uh, this is strange.
all those years...
I'm guessing it belonged to your wife?
my wife is dead.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
it's just I found something in the car that I thought may have belonged to a child.
this was my little girl's.
it was really very, very thoughtful of you to go to all this trouble.
it was no trouble.
my wife, Anna, we were separated at the time.
she died up in those woods in a snowstorm.
just a bit of a shock seeing all of this.
I understand.
I'd rather not have this.
maybe you can give it to a hospital or something.
brings up some pretty tough memories.
I don't mean to spy, but did something happen to your daughter also?
worse thing that can happen to a little girl.
I'm so sorry.
she was abandoned by her mother.
you mean she didn't die in the storm?
no.
she wasn't even in the car.
she was at home with me.
Where's my baby?!
I don't know yet.
are you hiding her?
no.
I'm trying to help you, but I need to know what you remember.
nothing. I don't remember anything.
OK. I know that this is hard, but you have to try.
it will come if you're not afraid of remembering.
but I am afraid.
look at the doll.
that's what you were protecting.
I was scared.
it was bad out.
I knew it was stupid to be on the road, but I felt like I couldn't stop.
like I shouldn't stop.
I don't know why.
I panicked.
where was my baby?
I couldn't remember.
Anna, I...
I found your husband.
lane was with him that night. She wasn't in the car with you.
what?
she's alive.
I can't believe it.
can I see her?
no, I haven't found her yet.
but there's something else.
your husband said that you left him and Lane, that he raised her alone.
no.
no. No, I would never do that.
she's my life, she's all I have.
Yeah. I'm sure that that's true, but Brad said...
No! I didn't abandon my baby!
OK.
maybe I should talk to her alone first.
see how she feels.
Brad said that she lives nearby, so...
I have to see her.
you will.
I swear. Just...
let me do this first.
my baby's alive.
Hi. I'm melinda . Gordon.
I own the antique shop in town.
I found something that I think you might want.
I talked to your dad.
Oh, my god. My muffins.
come in. Come in.
please don't burn.
hot, hot, hot!
Oh, oh! god!
you'd never guess I do this for a living.
Ah. Chocolate peanut butter cup.
my new greatest invention.
those aren't the ones they sell at village Java, are they?
the very same.
I love those. I'm totally addicted.
it's part of my evil plan.
I do birthdays, too.
so, you were saying that, uh, my father sent you?
but if what you found is a wedding dress, you can forget about it.
a dress?
I know he means well, and I'm sure your vintage pieces are very sweet, but I told him a gazillion times, it's a hawaiian luau.
I mean, I love the guy to bits, but it's my wedding, right?
I'm, you know, actually...
Ah! Oh!
I'm such a klutz.
don't scare me like that.
I thought you were at the library studying.
well, I couldn't stay away from you so long.
OK. Enough with the flowers. I get it. You're sorry, but we are running out of vases.
Oh, god. I'm so rude.
Todd, this is Melinda.
she owns that cute antique store downtown.
Oh, yeah. It was nice to meet you.
Hey, babe, I'm gonna squeeze in a couple more hours before dinner.
great.
as if getting married wasn't enough, he's studying for the bar.
Mmm. Why all the flowers?
he feels bad.
it was a nothing argument really.
it was my fault.
but who's complaining, right?
right. Um, actually, I didn't come here about a dress.
I wanted to return something to you.
uh, no. That's--that's not mine.
why would you think it is?
because I found it in your mom's car.
it's yours, isn't?
what?
we should go outside and talk.
OK.
my mom left when I was 3, but it still gets to me.
so you remember her?
some.
how she used to sing along to the radio, the way she smelled when she kissed me good night.
the rest I just learned from my dad.
did your dad tell you why she left?
look, um...
you're real easy to talk to, but...
why are you asking me this?
your mother, her spirit is still here.
I've seen her.
I've spoken to her.
you're telling me you've seen my mother's ghost?
I know.
believe me, I know that it sounds crazy, but...it's my gift.
she's the one who gave me this doll, and she wanted to find you very badly.
she loves you very much.
what are you doing?
why are you doing this to me?
what?
nothing. I'm just telling you the truth.
my mother was mentally ill.
my father said she had delusional paranoia.
she left us.
she left me, and then she died, so I couldn't even know her.
uh! What the hell!
what happened? - I don't know.
it just explosion
what are you doing?
I'm sorry. I-I think anna is doing this. I'm just not really sure why.
look, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but I want you out of here, ok? Now.
you ok? -Uh...yeah.
what happened in there? - I had to see her.
she needs me.
she's a big girl now. She grew up really well.
you don't have to worry about her anymore.
Yes, I do!
look, if your marriage ended badly, I'm really sorry about that, but you can't take it out on lane and Todd.
believe me, the best thing that you can do for your daughter is just to move on.
no.
as long as my baby needs me,
I'm never leaving.
please!
Todd?! - No!
what's going on in there?!
Hello?
you have to get over here quick.
I think I need you.
the door's jammed.
don't worry. Jim will get us in.
Todd?!
where are you, man?
Oh, my god! Baby!
it's all right. He's all right. Come over here. Come over here.
Oh, my god. He's bleeding.
go away!
he's gonna need stitches.
I'm gonna go grab my kit. Pressure.
it wasn't enough that she abandoned me?
she's got to come back from the grave to haunt me?!
I don't know why she's not moving on, but I'll try to fix it, ok? I promise.
I have no idea how to fix this.
Oh, yeah? Maybe this'll help.
911 report. We just got it faxed to us.
Anna Fowler. Female. Caucasian.
cause of death, hyperthermia."Page one of 3. Where's the rest of it?
Hey, hey, hey. That was before we got computerized.
we're lucky to have gotten anything at all.
I'm sorry I'm so grumpy.
grumpy? You got a crazy ghost making you crazy.
Oh, I married a comedian.
Hey, the guy who wrote this report, do you know him?
Yeah. I know andy.
sure, I remember that night.
changed me forever.
got a call that morning from the woman's sister...
she was worried because she hadn't shown up the night before.
Andy, you led the rescue team up, right?
not right away. That storm was something fierce.
worst I'd seen up till then.
had to wait until it was practically dark for it to subside.
it couldn't have been easy finding her with all that snow falling.
you're not kidding.
there was no sign of her along the main road, so we split up.
the footprints were pretty well covered already.
but I knew they had to be hers.
so I followed them for quite a ways.
I knew right away that she didn't make it.
I went to check her pulse and that's when I realized...
what?
what did you realize?
the little girl was alive.
it was a miracle.
a true miracle.
her mother used the warmth of her own body to keep her kid alive.
lane was with her mother that night.
Anna died trying to save her baby.
why would her husband lie about that?
why would Brad lie about that?
I don't know. But I think that you do and I hope bringing you back here will help you remember.
she was with me.
she was with me.
Yes. She was. Anna...
no. You don't understand. It...
it all makes sense now.
mommy!
mommy, my dolly! Mommy!
I knew I should stay in the car, but...
it was like a refrigerator.
mommy, I'm scared.
I thought if I just kept moving.
come on, sweetie.
I was scared. I was trying to get away.
I just couldn't let him find me.
who? Who were you running from?
my husband. - Brad?
Yeah. - Why?
he hit me.
again. - Anna...
I always thought it was my fault.
if I could just be a better wife.
until that night...
come back here! I'm not done!
open the door!
and we had another one of our fights.
Anna! Open the door!
I thought she was asleep, but our fighting woke her up.
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.
Anna! Open the door!
mommy, don't let him in.
please don't let him in.
I saw how scared she was.
and I knew we had to get out.
but if you were being abused...
why didn't your friends or anyone help you?
I was too ashamed to tell them.
I wore long sleeves to cover the bruises.
and if anyone did notice, I'd just laugh it off.
clumsy me.
everyone thought we were the perfect couple.
and we were when we weren't fighting.
Brad would feel so bad after one of our fights, he'd spoil me like crazy, presents, big bouquets of flowers, the works.
is that why you attacked Todd?
because you saw him give Lane the bouquet of flowers?
when I saw him with that bouquet, something just snapped inside of me.
she has to know what you went through.
what you did for her.
please tell me she's not here.
it's just me.
she gone for good?
no, but she said she'd stay away until you're ready to see her.
that would be never.
Anna didn't abandon you.
what?
I talked to the paramedic who rescued you.
you were with her when she died.
I was with her when she left my dad?
she took you with her.
but...
why would my dad lie about that?
maybe he feels ashamed.
ashamed of what?
my dad? He's the greatest dad anyone could ask for.
did some pretty bad things to your mom.
look, my dad would never hurt anyone, ok?
if she said he did, it's because she's crazy.
I don't know. Maybe she hates me. You saw what she did to Todd.
that was because of the flowers.
your dad always gave her flowers after they had a fight.
it was a gut reaction when she saw Todd give you the bouquet.
OK. Stop. You've gone too far.
I don't need you meddling in my life.
it's complicated enough right now.
your mom died trying to keep you safe. She wanted to protect you.
and now she needs to know that you're ok so she can move on.
would it kill you to just at least talk to her?
that ship's already sailed.
at least I know I can trust my instincts. Anna isn't crazy.
but Lane didn't believe you?
when I told her her mom was abused, she just shut down.
well, that's a pretty big bomb you dropped on her.
kind of blows away everything she grew up believing.
Yeah. Her father is a therapist. I mean, you'd think he'd have it all figured out.
I guess she never really know.
Yeah. Well, I wouldn't mind meeting that guy in a dark room.
you are a bigger softie than me.
it was a nothing argument. My fault really.
I always thought it was my fault.
it's happening. - It's happening.
Oh, my god! I gotta go!
lane! Lane, it's Melinda!
are you ok?
I'm fine.
now isn't a good time.
do you want me to get you out of here?
are you crazy?
you've done enough damage.
lane, get in here
I left so this would stop.
but it didn't.
it never will.
then we have to do something.
she won't listen to me or to you.
not now.
what?
is this some twisted joke?
I'm sorry.
I would normally do this slowly, explain gently that I have a gift,
I can see spirits, I can cross them over, yada, yada.
frankly, I don't have the patience or the time.
lane needs you. - What do you mean?
I think she's being abused, just like you abused her mother.
what, um... what makes you say that?
look, Brad, you don't have to believe I can see ghosts, but please believe what I'm telling you about your daughter.
OK. Ok. I'll admit I had doubts about Todd.
I always thought it was just my own paranoia, projecting my own demons onto him.
but I know he loves her.
you loved me, too. Said you couldn't live without me.
you always said your heart beat only for me.
you said your heart beat only for her.
is she really here?
Can--can--can you tell her
tell her that I'm not the same person anymore?
that I've gotten help, and now I'm helping others.
I know that look of his, so full of guilt and remorse.
she can hear you.
I'm so sorry for...for what I did.
I just... hope you can forgive me.
all those times you begged me to forgive you, and I did...
because I loved you, because I believed you could change.
and it looks like you have, but I can't forgive you.
I forgave you too many times when I was alive.
she wishes she could, but it's too late.
right.
of course Brad, the reason that Anna is earthbound is not because of what you did to her.
it's Lane.
you have one chance to redeem yourself, to help your daughter, please tell her the truth about you, so she that can she can know the truth about Todd.
I didn't want you to know. That's why I lied.
I know it was wrong.
I hated myself for what I did to her.
I couldn't live if you hated me, too.
my mom didn't abandon me?
no. She didn't.
so you let me believe that my mother left me?
that she didn't love me?
Lanie, the only reason I'm bringing this up now is because I don't want you to make the same mistake your mother did.
what do you mean?
Anna thinks Todd is hurting you.
they say that little girls marry their fathers
just stop it, ok?
Todd and I are happy.
we're getting married, he's gonna pass the bar, and everything is gonna be great.
just stop this.
Lanie, please.
no.
my head is spinning.
I can't even think about this right now.
so you think she's waiting to see if Lane's okay?
sure. And believe me, she'll know. She's got the mommy-radar.
you know, I always wondered how my mom knew I spiked the punch at junior prom.
go ahead, make fun of me, but, you know what, it's powerful stuff.
see, I think Anna was in limbo. Earthbound but unaware.
her daughter got engaged, and it sent a ripple effect through the universe that woke her up.
Oh, to be continued.
is my mother here?
I always told myself it would get better.
when he passed the bar.
when we got married.
when we moved into a bigger house.
he wasn't going to change.
you did the right thing.
my mother did the right thing.
is that why she stayed here?
to stop me from staying with him?
can I...can I thank her?
you just did.
she's here?
she's so beautiful.
I can't believe this is the tiny little girl I held in my arms.
mom?
she wants you to know how proud she is of you.
no, mom. It was you.
I can't believe how strong you were to do what you did.
how tough you were.
you protected me.
you saved me.
we saved ourselves.
I'm so scared, mom.
I don't know what I'm going to do now.
Yes, you do.
it's inside you.
remember how strong you are.
and just think of me, and I'll be with you.
I'll be watching you from wherever I am.
she wants you to remember how strong you are.
she will always be watching over you.
I love you, mom.
I feel like I never got to say it to her.
you don't have to say it.
we both know it.
thank you for everything.
she's gone?
Yeah.
but she's happy.
at peace.
I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what else to say.
my name is melinda gordon.
I just got married, just moved to a small town, just opened up an antiques shop.
I might be just like you...
except from the time that i was a little girl, i knew that i could talk to the dead.
grandma: It's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits," my grandmother called them, the ones who have not crossed over yet because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
to tell you my story, i have to tell you theirs.
I'm serious.
we're newlyweds.
OK, fine.
...dancing with your true love.
seems like magic, though.
you guys...
I swear, that's enough already.
you can see me!
go away.
I'm looking for my doctor.
where is he?
I'm sure he's here. Tall.
you know what? It's really not a good time.
Hey, we got her stabilized.
she should be all right.
what's gonna happen to her?
well, all they can do is hold her for a few days.
the hospital psych team will evaluate her.
if they feel like she's not a threat to herself of anybody else, they gotta let her go. Let's get out of here.
you know what? Why don't you guys go ahead, and i'll catch up.
all right.
how come you're the only one who can see me?
I've been asking myself that question for years.
who are you?
I'm conor donovan.
um... i'm her fiance.
you mean were her fiance.
semantics.
has she tried this before?
no.
well, she's been depressed since...
since i left.
can i ask how... how i left?
it was, um, a year ago.
my third triathlon.
I was kicking ass...
a 212 mile swim, a 112-mile bike.
I was just getting ready to start the 26-mile run.
I was heading for my best time ever.
nothing was gonna stop me. Nothing...
except a little kid on a speedster 8500.
I remember thinking how much i envied that kid.
my father gave me that same bike when i was about his age, and i just wanted to talk to him all about it, you know?
I wanted to ride that bike again so bad, but then, just like that, no more conor donovan.
I'm sorry.
I didn't even know what sorry was until i saw gwen get the news.
to see the life just go right out of their eyes.
that was a year ago, and you're still here.
Why?
look at her.
how can i leave?
she's got no family. She's all alone.
I have to take care of her.
you can't. You're not really...
present with her.
semantics again.
there is something else.
what?
Orderly: We have to move her now, ma'am.
did you stop by the hospital?
on my way in.
she kept asking for you.
I've known her for a year, but she asked for you?
I mean, how could she even know you?
she was unconscious the entire time.
she saw me. When?
she had an out-of-body experience before jim brought her back.
Oh. I should have known it was something simple like that.
she also saw her dead fiance.
he's haunting her, just fyi.
that's how you knew about the pills.
he was at the hospital with her, too.
Oh. That is so... creepy.
wait a minute.
this can't be.
what?
the county tax bill.
$15, 000?
small business assessment?
this is like 3 times what i thought it was gonna be.
if this is right, it's gonna totally blow through my savings.
I saw him. I saw conor...
at the apartment.
I knew he was there all along.
I know.
I saw you, too.
I saw you talking to him.
how did you do that?
tell her i'm here now.
tell her.
I know that this is gonna sound strange, and it's not your medication messing with your head.
um... i can see spirits.
earthbound spirits who haven't crossed over.
you mean like ghosts?
I don't know if they actually told you, but you...
you died, only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you.
he's a paramedic and...
that's when you saw me...
and conor.
you can talk to ghosts?
and hear them?
how?
it's a long story.
is he here now?
Yes, baby, i'm right here.
I've always been here.
he's here.
where?
right next to you. On your left.
Conor, you didn't leave me.
no, baby, i told you i'd never leave you.
can he hear me? Can he hear us?
Yeah.
I just... i wanted to see you so badly.
tell her how much i miss her.
I miss talking to her.
he wants you to know that he misses you.
Oh, conor, i miss you, too.
I feel you everywhere. It's like...
my skin hurts and the inside of my bones hurt and it's just... it's so deep i can't grab ahold of it.
I know, i know. I can't even touch it.
it's like l... baby, i feel it, too.
tell her i'm furious at her.
don't ever try that again!
he's mad at you for what you did, and he doesn't want you to ever...
no, i won't. I won't.
I know.
Nurse: That's enough for tonight.
don't go.
I won't. Baby, don't worry.
Hey, we'll see you soon, ok?
get some rest.
OK.
see what i mean?
she's the same now as she was the day i died.
you said there was...
what is it?
it might sound kind of morbid.
hello. I'm talking to a dead person.
I was an organ donor and the day i died, they took my heart.
I need to see who has it.
Why?
I've... i've... i've got to see what kind of person is...
I need to know that they're taking good care of it.
like waxing and cleaning it?
no. I just want to be sure they...
you know, that it went to somebody...
worthy.
I'm sorry.
and if you find that person, if you see them, will you...
cross over, move on?
what if i am happy here?
this isn't the place for you anymore.
if gwen gets better, if i feel she is taken care of...
then you'll go?
Yes.
he was the kindest man.
he was always trying to make somebody else's job easier.
we would be at a restaurant and he would brush the crumbs off the table, sweep them into his palm and just hold them until he could throw them out.
and he would grin at me and wink, like it was our little secret.
that's the thing about being with conor.
it felt like he was letting you in on this big secret, something just for the two of us.
ask her if she remembers the time we got lost in boston.
he's here.
I knew it. I thought i felt him touch me.
well, kind of, anyway.
it was like a feather against my arm.
sometimes spirits can let you feel their energy.
it's no more than like a little rush of air.
Yeah, right. I feel that a lot.
does he dim the lights sometimes, too?
they can also use their energy to affect electricity if they try really hard.
how do you know all this?
Gwen, the thing that i do...
my job, i guess you could say, is to help people get closure, make peace with death, sometimes get important messages across.
but it's all so that people can move on, people who die, people who are left behind.
the idea is to move on.
it's time for him to go.
did i tell you he used to read to me if i couldn't fall asleep?
there will never be anybody else like him, not for me.
I know it seems that way. No, it is that way.
everything happens for a reas, and that is why conor is still here.
that's fate, and there's nothing that you can do about it.
OK.
I want to talk about boston.
Jim: How come he doesn't know where his heart went?
probably because he went straight to gwen when he died.
Oh. I'm not sure it's such a great idea.
why not?
well, maybe a recipient doesn't want to know where his organ came from, especially a heart.
and that's a hard enough ordeal to go through.
they're asking you to meet the person who gave you your heart, and by the way, that person's dead.
it's been a year. Maybe he's curious.
besides, it's the only way i'm gonna get this guy to cross over, so just tell me where to start.
well, if he died at mercy, they've got a helipad, so his organs would have been harvested immediately and choppered right out.
but you are gonna need somebody at the hospital whose willing to bend the rules a little bit.
we never give out that kind of information.
Yeah, i know, but the thing is, i'm not trying to get you in any trouble.
it's just, the information is for someone very...
are you family?
well, in the family of man sense, i guess.
sorry. No way. Anything else?
can you at least give me cities and initials?
this isn't jeopardy! Bye, now.
Aw, damn. The second generator didn't kick in.
please wait here till the lights come back.
can you help me?
donor's name... date of death...
and the code r-w-h-o-d.
hurry.
OK. Got it. Thank you.
can i do anything for you?
rain check.
everything ok?
you can go now, if that's what you mean?
anyway, coming these past few weeks, listening, watching...
it was my doctor's idea, not mine.
he's always telling me to try...
we usually begin our talks with the introduction.
Oh, yeah. Ok.
my name is cliff aimes, and it's been a year since my surgery.
please tell everyone what kind of surgery.
transplant.
congratulations on your "surgiversary.
Yeah, but the thing is, i've had a bad heart my whole life.
I always felt like i had one foot in the grave and the other one on a banana peel.
Ow.
it's a tough room.
I mean, it's not like i'm not grateful for the heart i got. I am.
I just...
I feel even more afraid now, like...
maybe i don't even deserve to have it.
maybe someone else should talk.
I really liked what you had to say.
Why?
it sounded like the truth.
Melinda gordon.
cliff aimes.
don't tell me you're a heart patient.
no. No, i'm more like a student.
studying what?
the impact on people with things like this.
things like?
transplants. The emotional impact...
you know, what it's like to get a second chance.
I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with the first chance.
maybe you could help me.
I don't think so.
I'm just curious.
you may have noticed, i don't excel at talking to groups.
I'm not too good at talking one-on-one either, so...
it was nice to meet you.
do you ever find yourself thinking about the donor?
why would you ask me that?
I mean, it's a natural thing to...
what else do you want to ask me?
if i get hungry for things i never liked before?
if i smell things so freakin' familiar i just can't figure out what they are?
do you?
ask me if i feel guilty because some guy i didn't know is dead and i'm here, talking to you about it.
Jim: Well, what did you expect?
I expected somebody filled with joy about having a new lease on life.
and you got andy rooney.
Hey, how's gwen?
feeling better.
is her fiance still making things go bump in the night?
sometimes i don't know who's holding who back...
but every time i see them together, the only thing that i can think of is how lucky we are...
and what they'd give to have what we have.
let's not ever take that for granted, ok?
deal.
even so, if something ever happened to me and you were alone, i would want you to be happy.
uh! Uh! Shh!
no. I'd want you to find someone and find love again.
I mean, wouldn't you want the same thing for me if something happened to you?
no.
No?! You wouldn't want me to be happy?
fine. Sure i would, ok?
make friends, go out and make money, be happy, but no other guy.
OK.
out of the question.
how did i snag such a sensitive, modern man?
Hey, look at this.
it says that my tax bill was paid in full.
who could have done this?
Wow! I don't know.
maybe somebody you helped or something?
who? I don't know anybody who has this kind of money and how would they know?
I'm gonna call the tax board and find out.
anyway, i decided that we should get gwen out of her apartment.
right? I mean, she really needs a girls' night out.
that's a great idea.
cool. So saturday night, lento's on the square?
no karaoke? Cross my heart.
I'll be there.
aren't you haunting the wrong girl?
is that him?
Hi.
what are you doing here?
um... take my picture?
you don't meet the height requirement.
excuse me. I have to develop these.
develop? Thought everyone uses digital now.
everyone does. I don't.
listen, can i talk to you?
digital is electronic. It's cold.
film is chemical.
it's emotional. There's no comparison.
did you take these?
you have a wonderful eye.
you should put them out, let people see them.
Yeah. They'd just remind me of something else i never became.
No!
does he have any idea what he is doing to my heart?
do you smell that?
what?
like flowers?
gardenias.
no.
now it's gone.
that drives me crazy!
weren't you happy to get a new heart?
what? You don't think i'm grateful?
you don't think i wake up at night and hear it beating and just not understand why i should be so lucky?
sometimes i think they just wasted this on me.
he thinks too much.
maybe i just don't know how to use it.
I know you've been sick your whole life, and maybe you've just been sick for so long, you don't know how to be well.
look, there's no reason for you to listen to me and there's no reason for you to trust me. I'm just...
there's someone i'd like you to meet, someone i think you'd have something...
profound in common with.
I think you'd both get a lot out of it.
you have to have an open mind, though.
who?
cliff aimes, i'd like you to meet gwen alexander.
sorry. You just look so familiar.
Hi.
well, um...
we have a table all ready, so...
