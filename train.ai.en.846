do you think I'm an idiot? No, I'd say you possess above average intelligence.
you shipped off my only daughter.
and now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
he'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.
he has the finest armor gold can buy.
he needs to be out there.
the men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.
any dessert?
do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
because he has thousands of spies in his employ.
because he knows everything we do before we do it.
because he doesn't have a cock. Neither do you.
perhaps I'm dangerous, too.
you, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man.
that little worm between your legs does half your thinking.
it's not that little.
why are you smiling? Because I'm happy.
and why are you happy?
because I have your little whore.
I thought you preferred blondes. Such a droll little fellow.
tell me, have you married this one yet?
no?
Oh, good. Father will be so pleased.
why do you care who I fuck? Because a Lannister always pays her debts.
you stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.
this is madness. Stannis will be here in days.
you need me. - For what?
your skill in battle?
pretty thing, your whore.
lovely body.
the bruises will heal in time.
where did you find her? Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.
really, a Lannister lion necklace?
you need to hide your secret whores more carefully.
you've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
well, you're the expert.
tell me.
you don't buy them; You only rent them.
you're usually a better liar, baby brother.
this one you like.
you like her very much.
could it be love?
don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough...unless Joffrey is hurt.
and then every wound he suffers she'll suffer, too.
and if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.
and how do I know you haven't killed her already?
would you like to see her? I thought you might.
ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.
I'm sorry they hurt you.
you must be brave.
I promise I will free you.
don't forget me.
never.
I will hurt you for this.
a day will come when you think you're safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
and you will know the debt is paid.
get out.
I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?
you're beautiful.
then why do you look sad?
we have to be more careful.
don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.
there are people who want to hurt me.
I know. I won't let them.
I'll cut off their faces. I will.
I would kill for you. Do you know that?
I expect I'll have to before this is over.
you're mine.
I'm yours.
promise me.
I'm yours, and you are mine.
still no word?
we've sent a dozen ravens.
none have returned.
my bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
once he captures the castle- - Theon has my brothers.
if we storm the castle- - He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.
they're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
send word to your son.
any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
a touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much
any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.
he betrayed our cause.
he betrayed me.
and we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
your pardon, My Lord. Your Grace.
my Lady.
how are you?
how am I? I've had to arrest my mother.
the Lannisters have my sisters.
the man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers.
I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question.
I'm sorry. - No.
forgive me.
you're being kind. I have no right.
you have every right.
you're a king. That's not the kind of king I want to be.
what kind do you want to be?
I don't know. The good kind.
most kings grew up as princes.
they spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.
I'd like to hear you play the harp. No. No, you would not.
how did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
when I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding.
weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.
and they left me with my little brother.
the second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer.
we couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.
every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.
the rich, the poor, we were all there, naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.
drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.
I was treading water, talking to a friend when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.
I called his name.
then I started screaming his name.
and then I saw him floating facedown.
my heart just... stopped.
I was...
I dragged him from the water.
my friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember.
he was so little.
then we pulled him onto the riverbank...
and I screamed at him and I shook him and he was dead.
just dead.
a man ran over.
he had a fish tattoo on his face.
in Volantis the slaves have tattoos so you know what they are without having to talk to them.
and this man worked on a fishing boat.
and he pushed me out of the way.
you have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death.
but he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out.
and the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.
I decided two things that day.
I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.
and when I came of age...
I would never live in a slave city again.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
you told me of your problems and I've blathered on.
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
I don't want you to marry her.
but you needed that bridge.
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.
the sour cherries was all crushed up and ready. Shut up.
probably in the piecrust by now.
in the oven, the nice warm oven. Shut up. What did you bring?
the cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.
what did he want us to do about those guards?
he didn't say. He just said, "walk through the gates.
what about the guards?
he didn't say anything about the guards. What, he left that bit out?
it's a pretty important part, don't you think?
we have to trust him. - Trust him?
you trusted him to fight with us and you set him free - and he ran. - I want to go back to the kitchens.
shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
Arry, don't.
away! Reset!
if the wind holds, we'll reach King's landing in a day.
will it hold? Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.
again, pull!
I admire you, Ser Davos.
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.
some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.
so you take the onion for your Sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
my son wishes me to change it.
three mermen with tridents, something like that.
I understand why the older families look down at me.
do you? Why?
my father was a crabber. - And?
well, sons of Lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers.
our hands stink.
and where were those Lords when Storm's End starved?
many fought bravely for your brother.
many fought for the Mad King.
you defend these men who insult you behind your back.
some are happy to do it to my face. We were forgotten.
robert and Ned Stark- they were the heroes, the glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King while I held Storm's End with 500 men.
no one has forgotten, Your Grace. - No? Robert did.
he gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.
he was only a boy. - Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
first we ate the horses.
we weren't riding anyway, not with the castle surrounded.
we couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats.
so fine. I do like dogs.
good animals. Loyal.
but we ate them. Then the rats.
the night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying.
she couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.
and then you made it through the lines.
slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.
and potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.
every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
I was relieved they did not.
robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it.
then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up.
insult or no, I gave it up because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and I've always done my duty.
but now I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros.
and when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.
your Grace...
I pray I serve you well.
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
you're the master of whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
no man can be in all rooms at all times.
I have many little birds in the North, My Lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
the Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
to strike?
my dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege?
you do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
if my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him. A brave choice, Your Grace.
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.
they say Stannis never smiles.
I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
imagine Stannis's terror. I am trying.
you're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
Oh, no one disputes that, My Lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.
I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.
I wish we could, too.
what do you want?
tell me. If we're going to play, you'll have to start.
my brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.
my sister became queen at the age of 19.
when I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock. A most highborn plumber.
the water never flowed better.
and all the shit found its way to the sea.
I never expected to have any real power.
so when my father named me acting Hand
you're quite good at being Hand, you know?
jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men, honorable men, but they disdained the game and those who played.
you enjoy the game. - I do.
last thing I expected. And you play it well.
I'd like to keep playing it.
if Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.
they say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
the Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the drowned God wants them drowned.
why are all the Gods such vicious cunts?
where is the God of tits and wine?
in the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.
we should sail there immediately.
this morning I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.
Daenerys Targaryen lives.
a girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
she has three dragons.
but even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown.
and then there will be nowhere to hide.
one game at a time, my friend.
careful, Khaleesi.
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have 1, 000 eyes watching for you.
I found one a ship with a good captain.
she leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
Astapor? - We cannot stay here.
they have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
they're not your children.
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb.
they didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi.
and if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.
you should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
you know I would die for you.
I will never abandon you.
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve. Then serve me.
if my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.
that's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself.
if you enter that place, you will never leave again.
his magic is strong. - And what of my magic?
you saw me step into the fire.
you watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me?
do you remember?
until my last breath I will remember.
after I have forgotten my mother's face.
they are my children.
and they are the only children I will ever have.
take me to them.
we should bury them.
I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
if they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help.
as you say.
but it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.
what's this?
gold for the farmer.
for his trouble. His troubles are done.
he's feeding the crops now.
his wife, too.
you want to keep a man silent, you silence him.
got as far as the farm and then doubled back.
walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.
hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
you're right so far.
who was that out there hung up the gates?
must have been the farmer's boys.
he killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
they mustn't know.
bran would blame himself.
they'll never hear it from me.
the little lads have suffered enough.
why you help us? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
you're not our prisoner, little lady. You're lucky we found you.
these woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.
ride east. Your sister's waiting for you. - Come on. Come on.
I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
I might be able to take you with me. - Watch out for her.
watch out for her with him.
the Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
my lord. - You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible.
I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera.
we've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go.
what have we here? Frozen crows?
bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
that pig's got value to me.
what is it?
come, my lord.
you're a long way from home and winter is coming.
I want to buy them all. 8, 000.
master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
I have dragons.
they want the biggest one. - Done.
I'll take you as well, now.
you think you're the smartest man there is.
and if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say "my father.
you're nothing without your daddy.
never forget that.
here, this should help you remember.
how many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
depends if he's had any practice.
is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer?
she loosened you up for us?
he's going to fall.
he's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
water.
water.
please, water.
Wa-water.
water, please.
please. Please.
if I die, you won't be getting- - Oh, enough.
here.
can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
stop!
far enough.
do that again and I'll take your other hand.
come on, you.
Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.
I hope we might speak.
in confidence.
Oh, always in confidence. - About the events of the Blackwater.
perhaps this is the wrong time? - Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.
I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to end your life?
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid.
which is why I'm coming to you.
I need proof. - Proof?
will there be a trial? - I need to know.
I have no proof, only whispers.
before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.
do you want to hear it still?
I don't know. Do I?
as a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.
one day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.
I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys.
but what he wanted was far worse.
he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.
with a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.
he burned my parts in a brazier.
the flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.
I still dream of that night.
not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.
I dream of the voice from the flames.
was it a god? A demon?
a conjuror's trick?
I don't know.
but the sorcerer called and a voice answered.
and ever since that day,
I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
but you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess.
a symbolic revenge of sorts.
Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed.
which will require a degree of influence, which
you do not possess at the moment.
but influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.
once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.
I resolved to live to spite him.
I begged.
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.
I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.
step by step, one distasteful task after another,
I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.
influence grows like a weed.
I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
the sorcerer.
Hello, my old friend.
it's been a long time.
I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time...
if you have the stomach for it.
when people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling or the shit.
they tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.
and getting attacked or killed or worse.
and that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.
Oh, look.
more shit.
I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.
we need to get out of here.
when the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
the Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.
how'd that turn out for us? - He had no way of knowing.
we do now.
we know what's out there.
Craster's been out here surviving.
so he's your new protector now?
our good friend Craster? - We're like the sons he never had.
Mormont isn't gonna save you.
this lummox here isn't gonna save you.
when the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.
if we want to live...
we'll have to look out for ourselves.
shh, shh, shh.
you woke him. - I'm sorry.
he's beautiful. - Shh!
he's beautiful.
does he have a name?
no. - Are you going to give him one?
Why?
here.
Gilly. - You said to hold it for you until you came back.
you're back. - I wanted you to have it.
I don't want your stupid thimble.
I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that?
can you?
I don't have time for you.
I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
you have to go after him.
how?
you know how.
mother. - How many times have I told you?
no climbing. - Mother, I need to find it.
it's here. It's calling me. - I want you to promise me.
no more climbing. Promise me.
promise me! Promise me!
mother! Mother! - Promise me! Promise me, Bran!
promise me!
is he very large? - No larger than usual, apparently.
and yet they said that he was- - Extraordinary.
the most extraordinary man they've ever had.
and they've had a lot of men. - We're talking about the same Podrick?
the quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
what did he do to them? - I don't know, my lord.
the girls are usually quite descriptive.
so what did they say?
they said it was hard to describe.
prodigies appear in the oddest of places.
and what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
he was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.
sad, really.
is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
he hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.
but I don't think he's lost interest.
what makes you say so?
his shipboard inventory. - Ah.
you can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
former profession. - Of course.
I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
two featherbeds.
he's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger?
could he be bringing one of his girls?
he's not interested in them, my lord. - How do you know?
because I'm one of his girls.
prodigies in odd places indeed.
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon.
it ate her while her son watched.
what's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably.
there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
there aren't more than 700 people of any importance.
no, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.
Aerion Brightflame they called him.
he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
he was wrong.
and, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.
would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really.
it's like taking a walk through history.
the tomb's just up here. - This is so exciting.
you were married here, Your Grace?
Yes. - Must seem like only yesterday.
seems like a lifetime ago. - Your husband, was he buried here as well?
no, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.
such a tragedy. - A fairly predictable tragedy.
hunting and drinking don't mix. - I should say not.
my son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.
he had no business fighting an actual warrior.
we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.
but they do seem to yearn for it.
we shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.
and yet the world belongs to them.
a ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
the gods have seen fit to make it so.
my father didn't want them here.
he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
I'm glad he did.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this.
sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
I couldn't agree more.
shall we go and see them?
if you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold.
I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.
you led the defense of King's Landing.
they adore you.
open the doors.
wait.
lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!
bless you, Lady Margaery!
lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!
Margaery! - Long live Lady Margaery!
king Joffrey!
king Joffrey! King Joffrey!
king Joffrey!
gods bless King Joffrey!
how far is it to Deepwood Motte? - Not far, my lord.
your sister is waiting for you there.
she sent you to save me? - Yes.
I served them, the men who were torturing you.
I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.
why would you risk your life for me?
I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.
I was only a boy when they took you away.
my father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off.
I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, "That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.
and those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me.
did he?
I- I don't know, my lord.
They- they never told me much.
my sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
not all those are your sister's men.
some of them are loyal to your father.
what is it?
I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
what did he tell you to do? - Raid fishing villages.
he didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.
ha. I could never be a Stark.
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
he lorded it over you? - Didn't have to.
all he had to do was be.
be who he was born to be.
his life fit him better than his clothes.
how could someone like that ever be a brother to me?
he's the King in the North. And me...
my father gave me a choice and I made it.
I could never be a Stark.
but ironborn, that's what I was born to be.
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.
I murdered those boys.
the Stark boys?
never found them.
just some poor orphans living with a farmer.
I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies...
so I could keep Winterfell...
and make my father proud.
maybe it's not too late.
it is.
my real father lost his head at King's Landing.
I made a choice...
and I chose wrong.
and now I've burned everything down.
not everything, my lord.
she's up here.
Yara. - Shh.
wait.
I brought him back. He killed the others.
what? No, I didn't.
you can't!
no, please stop!
No!
put him back where he belongs.
eat.
what are you doing?
I'm dying.
you can't die.
you need to live to take revenge.
I don't care about revenge. - You coward.
a little misfortune and you're giving up.
Misfor- misfortune?
you lost your hand.
my sword hand. I was that hand.
you have a taste
one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit.
you sound like a bloody woman.
I know what you did for me.
you told them Tarth was full of sapphires.
it's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.
you knew that.
why did you help me?
you wanted to speak to me? - Yes, about Jaime.
what about him?
I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
when Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
you started a war. - And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
whatever you can.
whatever I can.
you're still here. - Yes.
Why?
did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons?
not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.
years and years of lectures on family and legacy
the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations
did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them?
that she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
all right. Contribute.
the Tyrells are a problem.
the Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
the Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.
she knows how to manipulate him.
good.
I wish you knew how to manipulate him.
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.
I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.
you've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
perhaps...
you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
I will.
do you like it, Nana?
another golden rose. How original.
I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.
I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better.
roses are boring, dear.
growing strong.
ha! The dullest words of any house.
winter is coming!
now that's memorable.
we do not sow. Strong. Strong.
those are houses you watch out for.
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.
but a golden rose growing strong
ha, that strikes fear in the heart.
look, little loves.
a spider in the garden.
run along now.
grow strong.
my lady.
I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing.
the city has been made brighter by your presence.
the city is made brighter by my presence?
is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
a little obvious, perhaps. - Oh, no, please.
seduce away. It's been so long.
though I rather think it's all for naught.
what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?
a question for the philosophers.
but you've come mincing all this way for something.
so? - Might I sit?
no.
come, I've heard you're such a clever man.
I'm curious why you've sought me out.
you've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
have I?
because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you?
why shouldn't I take an interest?
she's an interesting girl. - Is she?
no, not particularly.
but she's had an interesting childhood.
she has, sadly.
well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.
I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
come, come.
you surrender rather easily.
walk with me.
I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
which is Sansa Stark?
neither. A babe in the woods.
I admired her father. - Yes.
Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
I could not help Lord Stark.
perhaps I can help his daughter. - How?
you're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
that's hardly surprising.
she's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
it almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
and why have you come to me with this matter?
Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.
he has acquired the first two.
how long before he has the army?
perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.
Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.
if Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
and if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.
which seems such a shame.
why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
you must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
actually, I rather enjoy him.
but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
you are a clever man, Lord Varys. - You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.
one doesn't need to be clever for that.
it's all rather obvious, isn't it?
Ahem.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
you haven't. - We'd like some privacy, please.
if you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.
or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names,
I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.
what did you pray for?
I can't tell you. - Why not?
I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning.
let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.
boring and traditional, I'm afraid.
and you? - I'm sorry, I just can't.
my cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.
when I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
Pig-face, she called me. - Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
I think it had something to do with my nose.
whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.
so I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.
a week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
porridge plague? - You don't have it in the North?
your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
but that's awful.
you're
I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
don't say that. No, you're not.
so what happened to Alanna?
Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.
it's all terribly frustrating.
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.
you'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
I want us to be friends, good friends.
that would make me very happy.
you must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would.
we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.
you should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
the Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.
and if you were to marry Loras...
Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?
we would be sisters, you and I.
would you like that?
his name was Bannen.
he was a good man, a good ranger.
he came to us from
where did he come from?
down White Harbor way.
he came to us from White Harbor.
never failed in his duty.
he kept his vows the best he could.
he rode far, fought fiercely.
we shall never see his like again.
and now his watch has ended.
and now his watch has ended.
didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
it wasn't his foot that killed him.
that bastard Craster starved him to death.
Craster's got his daughters to feed. - You on his side?
we can't just show up and steal all his food.
we're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.
the day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.
he's a bloody wildling is all he is.
never knew Bannen could smell so good.
you have one son, don't you, Mormont?
I had my 99th.
you ever meet a man with 99 sons?
and more daughters than I can count.
I'm glad for you. - Are you now?
me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.
as soon as our wounded are strong enough.
they're as strong as they're gonna get.
them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it?
hmm?
or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.
whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
wait outside.
it's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
my wives gave you bread. There's sawdust in the bread.
you don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
I told you to wait outside.
he's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!
so you admit you've got a hidden larder, then?
how else'd you make it through winter?
enough! Out!
I am a godly man.
you're a stingy bastard!
bastard?
out with you, you little thief.
and you! And you!
go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.
I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
you are a bastard.
a daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.
the gods will curse us for this.
by all the laws- - There are no laws beyond the Wall.
now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
Unhand her.
I shall have your head for this.
quickly. Quickly. - What's happening?
I'm not going out there. - No, we have to go. Now!
follow me. I know the best way.
come on.
run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!
I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
can I take this hood off yet?
I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
Halt!
what is it? - Blackstrap rum.
not easy finding molasses in wartime. I'd have some.
let's go home.
what is this place?
somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
you look like a bunch of swineherds.
some of us were swineherds.
and some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
you're still swineherds and tanners and masons.
you think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
no.
fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
and I won't see them again.
stark deserters.
Baratheon deserters.
you lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog.
but here you are 1,000 miles from home.
which of us is running? - Untie these ropes and we'll find out.
what are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
Ned Stark is dead.
king Robert is dead.
my brother's alive.
you're fighting for ghosts. - That's what we are
ghosts waiting for you in the dark.
you can't see us, but we see you.
no matter whose cloak you wear
Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.
you found god? Is that it?
Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god.
as have we all.
as would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
if you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
you'll die soon enough, dog.
but it won't be murder, only justice.
and a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves.
at the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.
dump your dead children at some other door.
house Clegane was built upon dead children.
I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
do you take me for my brother?
is being born Clegane a crime?
murder is a crime. - I never touched the Targaryen babes.
I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling.
you want to cut my throat, get on with it!
but don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
you murdered Mycah.
the butcher's boy.
my friend.
he was 12 years old. He was unarmed.
and you rode him down.
you slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
aye, he was a bleeder.
you don't deny killing this boy? - I was Joffrey's sworn shield.
the boy attacked the prince. - That's a lie!
I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
then I should have killed you.
not my place to question princes.
you stand accused of murder.
but no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.
only the Lord of Light may do that now.
I sentence you to trial by combat.
so, who will it be?
should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest?
or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand?
or is the little girl the bravest one here?
Aye.
she might be.
but it's me you'll fight.
the master says they are untested.
he says you would be wise to blood them early.
there are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking.
should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
and who knows?
in 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn.
thus all shall prosper.
is it done, then? They belong to me?
it is done.
it is done.
she holds the whip.
you hold the whip.
the bitch has her army.
Unsullied!
forward march!
Halt!
tell the bitch her beast won't come.
a dragon is not a slave.
you speak Valyrian?
I am Deanerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria.
Valyrian is my mother tongue.
Unsullied!
slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child.
strike the chains off every slave you see!
I am your master!
kill her! Kill her!
kill her!
Dracarys.
Unsullied!
you have been slavs all your life. Today you are free.
any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him.
I give you my word.
will you fight for me? As free men?
why you help us? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
you're not our prisoner, little lady. You're lucky we found you.
these woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter.
ride east. Your sister's waiting for you. - Come on. Come on.
I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
I might be able to take you with me. - Watch out for her.
watch out for her with him.
the Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
my lord. - You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible.
I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera.
we've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go.
what have we here? Frozen crows?
bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
that pig's got value to me.
what is it?
come, my lord.
you're a long way from home and winter is coming.
I want to buy them all. 8, 000.
master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
I have dragons.
they want the biggest one. - Done.
I'll take you as well, now.
you think you're the smartest man there is.
and if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say "my father.
you're nothing without your daddy.
never forget that.
here, this should help you remember.
how many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
depends if he's had any practice.
is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer?
she loosened you up for us?
he's going to fall.
he's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
water.
water.
please, water.
Wa-water.
water, please.
please. Please.
if I die, you won't be getting- - Oh, enough.
here.
can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
stop!
far enough.
do that again and I'll take your other hand.
come on, you.
Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.
I hope we might speak.
in confidence.
Oh, always in confidence. - About the events of the Blackwater.
perhaps this is the wrong time? - Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.
I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to end your life?
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid.
which is why I'm coming to you.
I need proof. - Proof?
will there be a trial? - I need to know.
I have no proof, only whispers.
before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.
do you want to hear it still?
I don't know. Do I?
as a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.
one day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.
I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys.
but what he wanted was far worse.
he gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.
with a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.
he burned my parts in a brazier.
the flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.
I still dream of that night.
not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.
I dream of the voice from the flames.
was it a god? A demon?
a conjuror's trick?
I don't know.
but the sorcerer called and a voice answered.
and ever since that day,
I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
but you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess.
a symbolic revenge of sorts.
Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed.
which will require a degree of influence, which
you do not possess at the moment.
but influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.
once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.
I resolved to live to spite him.
I begged.
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.
I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.
step by step, one distasteful task after another,
I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.
influence grows like a weed.
I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
the sorcerer.
Hello, my old friend.
it's been a long time.
I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time...
if you have the stomach for it.
when people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling or the shit.
they tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.
and getting attacked or killed or worse.
and that. But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.
Oh, look.
more shit.
I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.
we need to get out of here.
when the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
the Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.
how'd that turn out for us? - He had no way of knowing.
we do now.
we know what's out there.
Craster's been out here surviving.
so he's your new protector now?
our good friend Craster? - We're like the sons he never had.
Mormont isn't gonna save you.
this lummox here isn't gonna save you.
when the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.
if we want to live...
we'll have to look out for ourselves.
shh, shh, shh.
you woke him. - I'm sorry.
he's beautiful. - Shh!
he's beautiful.
does he have a name?
no. - Are you going to give him one?
Why?
here.
Gilly. - You said to hold it for you until you came back.
you're back. - I wanted you to have it.
I don't want your stupid thimble.
I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that?
can you?
I don't have time for you.
I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
you have to go after him.
how?
you know how.
mother. - How many times have I told you?
no climbing. - Mother, I need to find it.
it's here. It's calling me. - I want you to promise me.
no more climbing. Promise me.
promise me! Promise me!
mother! Mother! - Promise me! Promise me, Bran!
promise me!
is he very large? - No larger than usual, apparently.
and yet they said that he was- - Extraordinary.
the most extraordinary man they've ever had.
and they've had a lot of men. - We're talking about the same Podrick?
the quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
what did he do to them? - I don't know, my lord.
the girls are usually quite descriptive.
so what did they say?
they said it was hard to describe.
prodigies appear in the oddest of places.
and what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
he was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.
sad, really.
is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
he hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.
but I don't think he's lost interest.
what makes you say so?
his shipboard inventory. - Ah.
you can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
former profession. - Of course.
I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
two featherbeds.
he's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger?
could he be bringing one of his girls?
he's not interested in them, my lord. - How do you know?
because I'm one of his girls.
prodigies in odd places indeed.
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon.
it ate her while her son watched.
what's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
the ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably.
there appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
there aren't more than 700 people of any importance.
no, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.
Aerion Brightflame they called him.
he thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
he was wrong.
and, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.
would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really.
it's like taking a walk through history.
the tomb's just up here. - This is so exciting.
you were married here, Your Grace?
Yes. - Must seem like only yesterday.
seems like a lifetime ago. - Your husband, was he buried here as well?
no, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End.
such a tragedy. - A fairly predictable tragedy.
hunting and drinking don't mix. - I should say not.
my son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
all he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion.
he had no business fighting an actual warrior.
we mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.
but they do seem to yearn for it.
we shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing.
and yet the world belongs to them.
a ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
the gods have seen fit to make it so.
my father didn't want them here.
he was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
I'm glad he did.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this.
sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
I couldn't agree more.
shall we go and see them?
if you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold.
I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.
you led the defense of King's Landing.
they adore you.
open the doors.
wait.
lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!
bless you, Lady Margaery!
lady Margaery! - Lady Margaery!
Margaery! - Long live Lady Margaery!
king Joffrey!
king Joffrey! King Joffrey!
king Joffrey!
gods bless King Joffrey!
how far is it to Deepwood Motte? - Not far, my lord.
your sister is waiting for you there.
she sent you to save me? - Yes.
I served them, the men who were torturing you.
I did what they told me and waited for the right moment.
why would you risk your life for me?
I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.
I was only a boy when they took you away.
my father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off.
I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, "That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.
and those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me.
did he?
I- I don't know, my lord.
They- they never told me much.
my sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
not all those are your sister's men.
some of them are loyal to your father.
what is it?
I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
what did he tell you to do? - Raid fishing villages.
he didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.
ha. I could never be a Stark.
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
he lorded it over you? - Didn't have to.
all he had to do was be.
be who he was born to be.
his life fit him better than his clothes.
how could someone like that ever be a brother to me?
he's the King in the North. And me...
my father gave me a choice and I made it.
I could never be a Stark.
but ironborn, that's what I was born to be.
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.
I murdered those boys.
the Stark boys?
never found them.
just some poor orphans living with a farmer.
I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies...
so I could keep Winterfell...
and make my father proud.
maybe it's not too late.
it is.
my real father lost his head at King's Landing.
I made a choice...
and I chose wrong.
and now I've burned everything down.
not everything, my lord.
she's up here.
Yara. - Shh.
wait.
I brought him back. He killed the others.
what? No, I didn't.
you can't!
no, please stop!
No!
put him back where he belongs.
eat.
what are you doing?
I'm dying.
you can't die.
you need to live to take revenge.
I don't care about revenge. - You coward.
a little misfortune and you're giving up.
Misfor- misfortune?
you lost your hand.
my sword hand. I was that hand.
you have a taste
one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit.
you sound like a bloody woman.
I know what you did for me.
you told them Tarth was full of sapphires.
it's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.
you knew that.
why did you help me?
you wanted to speak to me? - Yes, about Jaime.
what about him?
I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
when Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
you started a war. - And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
whatever you can.
whatever I can.
you're still here. - Yes.
Why?
did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons?
not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.
years and years of lectures on family and legacy
the same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations
did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them? Living by them?
that she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
all right. Contribute.
the Tyrells are a problem.
the Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
the Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives.
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.
she knows how to manipulate him.
good.
I wish you knew how to manipulate him.
I don't distrust you because you're a woman.
I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are.
you've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
perhaps...
you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
I will.
do you like it, Nana?
another golden rose. How original.
I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.
I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better.
roses are boring, dear.
growing strong.
ha! The dullest words of any house.
winter is coming!
now that's memorable.
we do not sow. Strong. Strong.
those are houses you watch out for.
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.
but a golden rose growing strong
ha, that strikes fear in the heart.
look, little loves.
a spider in the garden.
run along now.
grow strong.
my lady.
I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing.
the city has been made brighter by your presence.
the city is made brighter by my presence?
is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?
a little obvious, perhaps. - Oh, no, please.
seduce away. It's been so long.
though I rather think it's all for naught.
what happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?
a question for the philosophers.
but you've come mincing all this way for something.
so? - Might I sit?
no.
come, I've heard you're such a clever man.
I'm curious why you've sought me out.
you've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
have I?
because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you?
why shouldn't I take an interest?
she's an interesting girl. - Is she?
no, not particularly.
but she's had an interesting childhood.
she has, sadly.
well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.
I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being.
come, come.
you surrender rather easily.
walk with me.
I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
which is Sansa Stark?
neither. A babe in the woods.
I admired her father. - Yes.
Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
I could not help Lord Stark.
perhaps I can help his daughter. - How?
you're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
that's hardly surprising.
she's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
it almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
a confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
and why have you come to me with this matter?
Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.
he has acquired the first two.
how long before he has the army?
perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth.
Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.
if Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
and if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket.
which seems such a shame.
why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
you must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
actually, I rather enjoy him.
but he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
you are a clever man, Lord Varys. - You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.
one doesn't need to be clever for that.
it's all rather obvious, isn't it?
Ahem.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
you haven't. - We'd like some privacy, please.
if you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep.
or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names,
I'll ask the king to speak with you himself.
what did you pray for?
I can't tell you. - Why not?
I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning.
let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.
boring and traditional, I'm afraid.
and you? - I'm sorry, I just can't.
my cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.
when I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
Pig-face, she called me. - Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
I think it had something to do with my nose.
whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink.
so I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease.
a week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
porridge plague? - You don't have it in the North?
your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
but that's awful.
you're
I believed you! Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.
don't say that. No, you're not.
so what happened to Alanna?
Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.
it's all terribly frustrating.
I'm sure she's jealous of you now.
you'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.
I want us to be friends, good friends.
that would make me very happy.
you must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would.
we have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.
you should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
I- I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
the Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.
and if you were to marry Loras...
Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?
we would be sisters, you and I.
would you like that?
his name was Bannen.
he was a good man, a good ranger.
he came to us from
where did he come from?
down White Harbor way.
he came to us from White Harbor.
never failed in his duty.
he kept his vows the best he could.
he rode far, fought fiercely.
we shall never see his like again.
and now his watch has ended.
and now his watch has ended.
didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.
it wasn't his foot that killed him.
that bastard Craster starved him to death.
Craster's got his daughters to feed. - You on his side?
we can't just show up and steal all his food.
we're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves.
the day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.
he's a bloody wildling is all he is.
never knew Bannen could smell so good.
you have one son, don't you, Mormont?
I had my 99th.
you ever meet a man with 99 sons?
and more daughters than I can count.
I'm glad for you. - Are you now?
me, I'll be glad when you and yours have gone.
as soon as our wounded are strong enough.
they're as strong as they're gonna get.
them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it?
hmm?
or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.
whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
wait outside.
it's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
my wives gave you bread. There's sawdust in the bread.
you don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.
I told you to wait outside.
he's sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
I gave you crows enough. I've got to feed my women!
so you admit you've got a hidden larder, then?
how else'd you make it through winter?
enough! Out!
I am a godly man.
you're a stingy bastard!
bastard?
out with you, you little thief.
and you! And you!
go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.
I'll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
you are a bastard.
a daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.
the gods will curse us for this.
by all the laws- - There are no laws beyond the Wall.
now show us where he hides the food or you'll get the same as he did.
Unhand her.
I shall have your head for this.
quickly. Quickly. - What's happening?
I'm not going out there. - No, we have to go. Now!
follow me. I know the best way.
come on.
run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!
I'll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
can I take this hood off yet?
I do apologize, little lady, but it's better for you if you don't see where we're going.
Halt!
what is it? - Blackstrap rum.
not easy finding molasses in wartime. I'd have some.
let's go home.
what is this place?
somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
you look like a bunch of swineherds.
some of us were swineherds.
and some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
you're still swineherds and tanners and masons.
you think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
no.
fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
and I won't see them again.
stark deserters.
Baratheon deserters.
you lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.
last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog.
but here you are 1,000 miles from home.
which of us is running? - Untie these ropes and we'll find out.
what are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.
Ned Stark is dead.
king Robert is dead.
my brother's alive.
you're fighting for ghosts. - That's what we are
ghosts waiting for you in the dark.
you can't see us, but we see you.
no matter whose cloak you wear
Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.
you found god? Is that it?
Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god.
as have we all.
as would any man who's seen the things we've seen.
if you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
you'll die soon enough, dog.
but it won't be murder, only justice.
and a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves.
at the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.
dump your dead children at some other door.
house Clegane was built upon dead children.
I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
do you take me for my brother?
is being born Clegane a crime?
murder is a crime. - I never touched the Targaryen babes.
I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling.
you want to cut my throat, get on with it!
but don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.
you murdered Mycah.
the butcher's boy.
my friend.
he was 12 years old. He was unarmed.
and you rode him down.
you slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
aye, he was a bleeder.
you don't deny killing this boy? - I was Joffrey's sworn shield.
the boy attacked the prince. - That's a lie!
I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
then I should have killed you.
not my place to question princes.
you stand accused of murder.
but no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.
only the Lord of Light may do that now.
I sentence you to trial by combat.
so, who will it be?
should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest?
or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand?
or is the little girl the bravest one here?
Aye.
she might be.
but it's me you'll fight.
the master says they are untested.
he says you would be wise to blood them early.
there are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking.
should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
and who knows?
in 10 years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn.
thus all shall prosper.
is it done, then? They belong to me?
it is done.
it is done.
she holds the whip.
you hold the whip.
the bitch has her army.
Unsullied!
forward march!
Halt!
tell the bitch her beast won't come.
a dragon is not a slave.
you speak Valyrian?
I am Deanerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria.
Valyrian is my mother tongue.
Unsullied!
slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child.
strike the chains off every slave you see!
I am your master!
kill her! Kill her!
kill her!
Dracarys.
Unsullied!
you have been slavs all your life. Today you are free.
any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him.
I give you my word.
will you fight for me? As free men?
the Tyrells are a problem.
the Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. You must see Highgarden.
I don't think the queen would let me leave King's Landing.
once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen.
and if you were to marry Loras you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
I have a wife. - She's shut away in a tower.
and she's given you no sons, only stillborns.
I lost one son to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.
I grieve for your sons, my lord. I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance.
do that again and I'll take your other hand.
what value was the mill? - I seized an opportunity.
we took hostages- Willem Lannister, Martyn Lannister.
willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
I'm not your enemy.
this woman is evil! - Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
you want to assassinate a girl?
based on whose information? - Ser Jorah Mormont.
he is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.
you bring us the whispers of a traitor.
Beric Dondarrion? If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.
you'll die soon enough, but it won't be murder.
I sentence you to trial by combat.
is it done, then?
it is done
the bitch has her army
unsullied
slay the masters
slay the masters
strike the chains off every slave you see
kill her
Dracarys.
Lord, cast your light upon us.
lord of Light, defend us.
show us the truth.
strike this man down if he is guilty.
give strength to his sword if he is true.
lord of Light, give us wisdom.
for the night is dark and full of terrors.
for the night is dark and full of terrors.
get back.
guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
kill him!
Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant.
bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished.
restore it.
for the night is dark and full of terrors.
Lord, cast... - Arya, don't!
bring him back from death and darkness...
No!
let go of me! Let me go!
looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.
burn in hell! He will.
but not today.
Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.
tell me what you know.
there are four to a patrol，two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.
how often do these patrols go out?
it varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
you'd like to know that.
there are 19 castles guarding the Wall.
how many are manned?
three.
you sure of that?
which three?
castle Black. Aye, Castle Black.
everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
how many men remain in Castle Black?
1, 000. - Liar.
what happens to your eagle after I kill you?
does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
he's no crow. Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.
I'm not afraid of you.
I like you, boy.
but if you lie to me,
I'll pull your guts out through your throat.
1, 000 men.
we'll find out soon enough.
I don't need you to protect me. Of course you do.
who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?
who vouched for you with Mance?
it seems you owe me a debt.
give it back. - Well, I stole it.
it's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.
Ygritte! Seven hells.
is Orell right? Are you still a crow?
it's time you proved yourself.
you swore some vows.
I want you to break 'em.
I want you to see me.
all of me.
we shouldn't.
we should.
why are you still dressed?
you know nothing, Jon Sno
that thing you did with your mouth is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
I don't know.
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
you seemed to like it. Aye, I liked it some.
who taught you that?
there's been no one else. Only you.
a maid.
you were a maid.
I was a man of the Night's Watch.
how about you? Were you a maid?
what do you think?
who was he? - Just a boy.
he came trading with his brothers.
he had red hair like me. Kissed by fire.
but...
he was weak.
not like you. That was the first one.
then there was this Thenn boy.
spoke no common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.
Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough.
we'd best get back.
I'm not done with you yet.
how long's it been since you had a bath?
let's not go back.
let's stay here a while longer.
I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.
not ever.
I want my gold.
it says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
we're outlaws. Outlaws steal.
you're lucky we didn't kill you. Come try it, archer.
I'll shove those arrows up your ass.
you can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
not in the eyes of god. - You can't!
enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
the Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.
riders coming through!
the Kingslayer. Down!
on your knees.
lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.
pick him up, Locke.
you've lost a hand. No, my lord, he has it here.
take this away. - Send it to his father?
you'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
cut her free. Apologies, my lady.
you're under my protection now. Thank you, my lord.
find suitable rooms for our guests.
we'll speak later.
lord Bolton.
is there word from the capital?
you haven't heard?
Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing.
sailed into Blackwater Bay.
stormed the gates with thousands of men.
and your sister...
how can I put this?
your sister is alive and well.
your father's forces prevailed.
ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
will I die? - No.
the corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cut away.
the safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
then you'll die.
you're no maester.
Where's your chain?
the Citadel stripped me of it.
they found some of my experiments too bold.
I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.
I don't need my right hand to kill you.
I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine. - Mmm.
with any luck, that will suffice.
you'll need milk of the poppy.
no milk of the poppy. - There will be pain.
I'll scream. - Quite a bit of pain.
I'll scream loudly.
lord Baelish. Your Grace.
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
of course, Your Grace.
I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
my father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
myself, I often find them a hindrance.
and he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.
he's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't.
you have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.
I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
I shall do my best. - Thank you.
and your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
I assure you that it will.
gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.
pardon, my lady. - No need to speak.
are there any figs? Fetch some.
I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels.
to what do I owe this summons?
thank you for seeing me, my lady.
I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
it's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
naturally. It's shaping up to be a very involved affair.
the word extravagant has been used.
what good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
I understand that. - Good.
but, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown.
as of now, it's a huge expense.
And?
and we're at war, Lady Olenna.
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten. Yes, and maintaining supply lines
I can't think how it slipped my mind.
what is it, 12, 000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?
1, 800 mounted lances. 2, 000 in support.
provisions so this city might survive the winter.
a million bushels of wheat.
half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.
20, 000 head of cattle. 50, 000 sheep.
you don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses.
I'm quite familiar with them.
and we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
as is a royal wedding.
the people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions.
and if we don't provide them, they'll create their own.
and their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.
a royal wedding is much safer.
wouldn't you say? - I would.
and traditionally paid for by the royal family.
I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.
you can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.
where did you go for them, Volantis?
my lady- - Oh, very well.
I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.
we'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned.
is that sufficient? - Quite sufficient. Thank you.
very good, then. That's settled. Good day.
give me that.
what are you doing?
just mending Lord Beric's armor.
Why?
I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
have you lost your mind?
when the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths?
they'll cave your head in with your own helmet.
the Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
you don't have to do this. I want to.
they need good men.
Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow.
and then you- - What? Serve him?
I've served men my entire life.
I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch.
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed.
I'm done serving. You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
he may be their leader, but they chose him.
these men are brothers. They're a family.
I've never had a family.
I can be your family.
you wouldn't be my family.
you'd be "my lady.
is this a rescue? - Lannister filth! Take him!
please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire.
please
bring them in.
is that all of them?
it took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
not murder, Your Grace.
vengeance.
vengeance?
those boys didn't kill your sons.
I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen
was strangled by the Kingslayer.
they were his kin. - They were boys!
look at them.
tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
my mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
it's treason to free your enemies.
in war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?
leave him.
Aye.
leave me to the king.
he wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.
that's how he deals with treason.
our King in the North.
or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.
hang the rest. Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone.
I only watched for the guards. This one was only the watcher.
hang him last so he can watch the others die.
please! Please, no. They made me do it!
they made me! They made me!
word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews.
the Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
would you make me a liar as well as a murderer? It wouldn't be lying.
we will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn.
he has to die.
the Karstarks are Northmen.
they won't forgive the killing of their lord.
your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.
you tended to their wounds.
you brought them supper. Now they're dead.
and more boys will keep dying until this war is over.
you need Karstark men to end it.
spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
a hostage.
tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.
the blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy.
I fought the Mad King for your father.
I fought Joffrey for you.
we are kin
stark and Karstark. That didn't stop you from betraying me.
and it won't save you now.
I don't want it to save me.
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
kneel, my lord.
lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.
would you speak a final word?
kill me and be cursed.
you are no king of mine.
ser Meryn.
the Hound.
what are you going to do with me? At first light we'll ride for Riverrun.
your brother's there now.
he'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
don't think of it that way.
but it is that way. - It is.
and it isn't. - More is than isn't.
Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.
he wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
so why don't you? - We need the gold.
do I frighten you, child?
no.
you're angry with me. And I don't blame you.
but letting him go was the right thing.
I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
I thought he killed you. - He did.
but how...?
how many times have you brought me back?
it's the Lord of Light brings you back.
I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
how many times? - Five, I think.
no, this makes six.
six.
there was the first time- the Mountain.
show her.
lance right through the chest.
then I was stabbed in the belly. Then it was an arrow in the back.
and that axe in the side.
then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.
was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
and the Hound makes six.
second time I've been killed by a Clegane. You'd think you'd learn.
it's not getting any easier, you know.
I know.
every time I come back,
I'm a bit less.
pieces of you get chipped away.
could you bring back a man without a head?
not six times. Just once.
I don't think it works that way, child.
he was a good man, Ned Stark.
he's at rest now, somewhere.
I would never wish my life upon him.
I would.
you're alive.
Lord, cast your light upon me.
protect me in the darkness.
burn away my sins.
help me serve you.
use me as you will.
for the night is dark and full of terrors.
I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
my lady.
I meant to come sooner.
the battle- - I know of your troubles, my king.
the Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
Yes, of course.
you mustn't despair. Your claim is true.
you will be victorious. - I believed that once.
you are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
I've broken a sacred vow.
I've sinned.
no. - I've wronged you.
I have shamed you. - You're doing god's work.
you don't understand.
the Red Woman
the Lady Melisandre
I know, Stannis.
the Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
no act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.
when she told me,
I wept with joy.
Oh, my sweet boys.
I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us.
she gave you a son.
I gave you...
nothing. - That's not true.
so you've come to see her as well?
there is no need.
you must keep away from such distractions.
she's my daughter.
I want to see her.
you are a king.
you don't need my permission.
father!
you've grown since I last saw you.
mother said you fought in a battle.
did you win?
no.
did the Onion Knight come back with you?
he did.
he fought bravely. He hasn't come to visit me.
he said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.
he won't be visiting, child.
why not? He's my friend.
look.
he made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it.
it's a secret.
mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.
ser Davos is a traitor.
he's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.
best forget him.
not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
what are you doing here? I need a bath.
help me out of these rags.
now get out.
there's another tub.
this one suits me fine.
don't worry. I'm not interested.
if I faint, pull me out.
I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
why should I care how you die? You swore a solemn vow, remember?
you're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece.
not going so well, is it?
no wonder Renly died with you guarding him.
that was unworthy. Forgive me.
you protected me better than most
don't you mock me. - I'm apologizing.
I'm sick of fighting.
let's call a truce. You need trust to have a truce.
I trust you.
there it is. There's the look.
I've seen it for 17 years on face after face.
you all despise me.
Kingslayer.
oathbreaker.
a man without honor.
you've heard of wildfire? Of course.
the Mad King was obsessed with it.
he loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones.
he burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him.
he burned anyone who was against him.
before long, half the country was against him.
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.
so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city
beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.
under houses, stables, taverns.
even beneath the Red Keep itself.
finally, the day of reckoning came.
robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident.
but my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels.
I knew my father better than that.
he's never been one to pick the losing side.
I told the Mad King as much.
I urged him to surrender peacefully.
but the king didn't listen to me.
he didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him.
but he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt.
you can trust the Lannisters," he said.
the Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.
so we opened the gates and my father sacked the city.
once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender.
he told me to...
bring him my father's head.
then he...
turned to his pyromancer.
"burn them all," he said.
burn them in their homes.
burn them in their beds.
tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it?
would you have kept your oath then?
first, I killed the pyromancer.
and then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back.
"burn them all," he kept saying. "Burn them all."
I don't think he expected to die.
he- he meant to...
burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.
I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen.
that's where Ned Stark found me.
if this is true why didn't you tell anyone?
why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
you think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?
he judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.
by what right does the wolf judge the lion?
by what right? - Help! Help!
the Kingslayer!
my name is Jaime.
onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.
princess? Gods, what are you doing here?
shh, you'll wake Bert. - Bert?
he's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight.
he likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here.
if your father knew- - He said you were a traitor.
are you?
I am, child.
I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.
I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here.
I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons.
Aegon used to live here. Did you know that?
and the Targaryens built this castle. - Aye.
so they did. - You can hide the book under your cloak.
it's a good one. I'll bring you more.
thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.
take it. I have more.
my lady, I can't read the words.
you can't?
I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.
no. No. No. - It's easy. It'll be fun.
go. We can't. - Why not?
what will they do, lock us in cells?
I wouldn't know where to start. At the beginning.
this word is Aegon.
when you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg.
and the title of the whole book is "An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros."
it was a bitch of a siege.
mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?
the second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.
thoros of Myr. Bloody madman.
robert knighted you after the battle?
proudest moment of my life.
one knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words.
in the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.
all I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
in full plate metal for 16 hours.
never occurred to me till the fighting was over.
I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
robert would have laughed.
he was a good man, a great warrior.
and a terrible king.
I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
you swore an oath. - Yes.
and a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic.
just once in my life before it's over,
I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in.
do you believe in her?
with all my heart.
these are the ones? Yes, khaleesi. The officers.
you did not choose this life
but your free men now and free men make their own choices
have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks
remove your helmet
this one has the honor what is your name?
grey Worm
grey Worm
all Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut
grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.
names that remind them what they are vermin.
from this day forward you will choose your own names
you will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same
throw away your slave name
choose the name your parents gave you or any other
a name that gives you pride
grey worm gives me pride it is a lucky name
the name this one was born with was cursed
that was the name he had when he was taken as a slave
but grey worm is the name this one had the day daenerys stormborn set him free
king Robert wanted her dead. Of course he wanted her dead.
she's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
I didn't sit on the small council. - No?
doesn't the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally
traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.
he didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.
can't say I minded much.
I always hated the politics.
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.
hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over. - Mm-hmm.
still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
she'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.
which men do you have in mind? Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
it suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
our cause?
forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.
we both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
you only joined us a few days ago.
I can't speak to your intentions.
if we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
you're not Lord Commander here.
you're just another exile.
and I take my orders from the queen.
come to bed. - You were right.
the Karstarks are gone.
almost half our forces.
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.
nothing.
only wait.
don't let him.
what can I do?
attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better.
he'd crush us in a day. We could ride north.
take your land back from the Greyjoys.
wait out the winter. - Winter could last five years.
once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again.
when I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.
now we're like a band of bickering children.
give them a new purpose.
what?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't even know where Winterfell is.
here.
and we're here. King's Landing
what is it?
I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.
and Casterly Rock can't run away.
I'm going to take their home away from them.
can you do it?
I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.
there is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters.
the man whose daughter I was supposed to marry
he's such a splendid fighter.
do you have any idea when we might...
I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
it should grow quickly. Joffrey won't let me leave.
he's got too many reasons to keep me here.
and only one to let you go.
because it will please me.
squire!
well fought, ser.
that was no fight. I don't know you.
Olyver, if it please you.
I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.
how did you know? Know what?
that I wanted to.
my lord...
I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.
they rarely do, in my experience.
you have a good deal of experience, do you?
with the husbands.
that didn't take long.
well, it took long enough.
it seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
is he?
and...
who's the lucky girl?
she may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine.
I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen.
strange, isn't it? - What is?
it doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.
your hair is different. Is it?
lady Margaery wears it that way. Many ladies wear it this way.
I have good news.
I'll be leaving the city soon. You still want me to come with you?
it's not a question of what I want.
it's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?
of course. More than anything.
but maybe it would be better to wait.
I've been thinking how dangerous it would be.
not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind.
I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you.
I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.
I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa.
your true friend.
I do, Lord Baelish.
if you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.
we'll speak again when I return.
you're late.
what's she doing here?
our business concerns her, too.
sit.
you'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell,
I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
very well.
she's a lovely girl.
missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.
your jokes are not appreciated. - It wasn't my best, but
I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
the Karstarks have marched home.
the young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered.
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.
that makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell.
and I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
the Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.
do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
there's nothing to refuse. This is a plot.
plots are not public knowledge.
and the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding.
we need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
and how do we do that?
we find Sansa Stark a different husband.
wonderful. - Yes, it is.
you can't mean it. I can and I do.
Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head.
now she's finally free of him and you give her to me?
that's cruel even for you. Do you intend on mistreating her?
the girl's happiness is not my concern, - nor should it be yours. - She's a child!
she's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.
there, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.
surely you're capable of that. - And if I refuse?
you wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle.
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.
and it is past time you were wed.
I was wed.
or don't you remember?
only too well.
you should be thanking the gods for this.
this is more than you deserve. Tyrion will do as he's bid.
as will you.
what do you mean? You'll marry Ser Loras.
I will not. - The boy is heir to Highgarden.
Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.
no, I won't do it. - Yes, you will.
you're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.
I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare. You're my daughter!
you will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
father, don't make me do it again, please. Not another word.
my children.
you've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
you will release every slave in Yunkai.
reject this gift and I shall show you no mercy.
you are mad. - It was just as you said.
their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
the bitch stays. - I'm taking her to King's Landing.
unless you kill me.
well, we must be on our way.
please. - I'm not killing you.
just making a few alterations.
No! Don't!
the Nightfort's closest to Castle Black.
it's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.
it leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort.
stop. - But your father
I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.
what if I never want you to?
and so my watch begins.
he's a crow. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
kill him.
the wolves are out there. You're a warg, Bran. Do it.
I'm going beyond the Wall. It won't be safe for Rickon.
I'm coming with you.
you and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.
she's just going to kill him. - Sacrifice him.
the boy's your nephew. The usurper Robb Stark...
she says there's power in king's blood.
got salt pork for the feast. - The feast is over.
mother.
the Lannisters send their regards.
it's too late.
go, move out! - The King in the North!
the King in the North!
the King in the North! The King in the North!
here comes the King in the North!
here comes the King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!
here comes...
ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
what are you doing? I have a list.
a list of people you mean to kill? For laughing at me?
do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme.
fear of death, on the other hand... You should learn to ignore them.
my lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you.
I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
you're a Lannister.
I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
the disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.
we're perfect for each other.
so how should we punish them?
who? Whom?
ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.
anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
I hear that you're a pervert.
I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
we could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.
you cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside.
then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.
his room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.
lady Sansa!
my sister used to do that when she was angry with me.
and she was always angry with me. Why sheep shift?
that's the vulgar word for dung.
my lady... Well, you asked me.
that's him!
my lord, my lady.
your father has called a meeting of the small council.
killed a few puppies today?
show him.
come on, show him.
Oh, apologies, my lord.
old fingers.
Roslin caught a fine fat trout.
her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.
signed Walder Frey.
is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
Robb Stark is dead.
and his bitch mother.
write back to Lord Frey.
thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head.
I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
a joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
Yes, I did.
I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
no.
she is no longer yours to torment.
everyone is mine to torment.
you'd do well to remember that, you little monster.
Oh, I'm a monster.
perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.
monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
I could have your tongue out for saying that.
let him make his threats.
hmm? He's a bitter little man.
lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.
unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
I am the king!
I will punish you.
any man who must say, "I am the king" is no true king.
I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.
my father won the real war.
he killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
the king is tired.
see him to his chambers.
come along. - I'm not tired.
we have so much to celebrate.
a wedding to plan. You must rest.
grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
I'm not tired!
come.
not you.
you just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
you're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
a treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
you really think a crown gives you power?
no.
I think armies give you power.
Mm-hmm. - Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
Mm-hmm. - Oh, I know.
Walder Frey gets all the credit.
or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance.
Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?
no.
he never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.
which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
I'm all for cheating. This is war. But to slaughter them at a wedding...
explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10, 000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
so that's why you did it? To save lives?
to end the war. To protect the family.
do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?
go ahead, write one.
I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
the northerners will never forget.
good.
let them remember what happens when they march on the south.
all the Stark men are dead.
Winterfell is a ruin.
Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
one way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
I will not rape her.
shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
the house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first.
a good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
does that amuse you? No, it's a very good lesson.
only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions. Easy for me, is it?
when have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
the day that you were born.
I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.
instead, I let you live.
and I brought you as my son.
because you're a Lannister.
it's empty.
let's find a place to sleep.
don't, Hodor.
maybe we shouldn't stay.
you'd rather be out there?
there are a lot of stories about this place.
horrible stories.
I always quite liked the horrible stories. So did I.
once.
you ever heard about the Rat Cook?
no. Who's he?
just a cook in the Night's Watch.
he was angry at the king for something, I don't remember.
when the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon.
that night he served the pie to the king.
he liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice.
the gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young.
he's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies.
but no matter what he does, he's always hungry.
if the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat
it wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie.
he killed a guest beneath his roof.
that's something the gods can't forgive.
"the late Walder Frey," old Tully called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle.
he thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully.
you're dead, your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun.
the Blackfish escaped.
an old man on the run with no allies.
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
who does he have? - As you say.
they all laughed at me, all those high lords.
they all thought they were better than me.
people snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
you'll be needing a new young girl.
Yeah.
got that to look forward to.
and you, the Warden of the North.
no more Starks to bow and scrape to.
must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
he ignored my advice at every turn.
if he'd been a trifle less arrogant... Calling himself the Young Wolf.
how's that for pomposity?
well, here's to the Young Wolf!
forever young.
will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
at some point perhaps.
but Winterfell's in ruins.
Yeah.
what happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
I heard he killed all the ravens.
and after that, nothing.
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
Oh. And? Ramsay delivered the terms.
the ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would.
they handed him over trussed and hooded.
but Ramsay- well...
ramsay has his own way of doing things.
well, the girls weren't lying.
you had a good-sized cock.
what?
no.
pork sausage.
you think I'm some sort of savage?
people talk about phantom limbs.
an amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.
so I've always wondered...
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?
sorry.
I shouldn't make jokes.
my mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
but my father taught me to aim for their head.
kill me.
sorry, what?
kill me.
a little louder.
kill me!
you're no good to me dead.
we need you.
you don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore.
that's a name for a lord.
but you're not a lord, are you?
you're just meat.
stinking meat.
you reek.
Reek!
that's a good name for you.
what's your name?
what's your name?
please.
what is your name?!
reek.
my name is...
reek.
don't kill me! - Who are you?
Sam! Sam! - Who are you?!
Gilly. Don't hurt us.
where are you going?
to Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
my brother, he's in the Night's- - Shush.
who's your brother? - Doesn't matter.
you're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
no, I'm not.
I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.
and I've heard all about Hodor.
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.
if you're his brother, you're my brother, too.
and anything I can do to help you, I will.
take us north of the Wall.
what?
why in the world would you want to go- I don't want to. I have to.
how did you get through the Wall?
does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
come with us.
there are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.
Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
come with us. There's nothing north but death.
if Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be.
it's the safest place for you.
there's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
what I know is what I saw.
and if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.
you saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.
how do you know all that? The Night's Watch can't stop them.
the kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
but you're going to stop them?
please, Sam.
I have to go north.
I have to.
Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North.
I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home.
on the first night of the full moon,
I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
in the box you'll find a special gift
theon's favorite toy.
he cried when I took it away from him.
leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.
signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton,
lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.
get that out of my sight.
Theon disobeyed my orders.
the boy is a fool.
he cannot further the Greyjoy line.
I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken.
get this away from me.
he's your son.
son?
he's not a man anymore.
he's your son.
he's my brother.
he's a Greyjoy. Watch yourself.
I've made my decision.
and I've made mine.
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.
get those ropes!
I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water.
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.
I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.
what is it? Dragonglass.
we found them at the Fist.
someone buried them a long time ago.
someone wanted us to find them.
Why? What are they for?
killing white walkers. How do you know that?
the walker came for my baby.
and Sam...
but no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.
well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
take it, Hodor.
and the archer.
I got lucky with one of them.
there are more.
many more.
and for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count.
I wish you'd come with us.
I wish I could.
I really do.
how are you keeping?
great.
never better.
it was just a bit of blood.
I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.
we're not really people to you, are we?
just a million different ways to get what you want.
I'm not a highborn. - She called you Ser.
I heard it.
a recent state of affairs.
I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help.
I lived below the Street of Flour.
how far below?
how close to the Red Keep were you?
the shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley. - Gin Alley.
the Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft.
you lived in the fancy part of town.
and here we are now.
two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
Yeah, we've come a long way.
we're all the same, really.
she went to great pains to point that out to me.
if you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
you're me.
never been with a woman.
never talked to a woman, really.
and then she comes at you
big words, no clothes.
what would you have done?
she does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.
so how'd you become a lord? Oh, that's a long story.
better not, then. I'm a bit busy.
many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation.
he rewarded me with a lordship.
and this.
you see?
Highborns.
I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept. Why did you?
I did it for my son.
I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door.
I wanted him to have a better life.
does he?
he's dead.
how'd he die?
following me.
when did you come to this strange country?
when I was 13. You were only a child.
I stopped being a child when I was nine.
my mother made sure of that.
you've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know.
he used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money.
now it's just the drinking.
and now I'm his wife's servant.
I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
she is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
I love that girl. I would kill for her.
do you think that makes it easier for me?
no, I expect not.
she's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
we break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family.
we've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen.
if you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister
I have a name. - You have one name.
as do I.
here only the family name matters.
what do you want from me, Lord Varys?
diamonds.
I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself.
get on one of those ships.
sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.
you can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants.
start a new life, a good life, far from here.
the mysterious foreign beauty.
you'll have suitors lining up. Why do you want me to leave?
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place.
he has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name.
and you are a complication.
I know you love him.
and I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver.
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.
I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him.
this will never be your home, my lady.
find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time.
lord Varys.
if he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
keep up.
I don't think I can, my lord.
it's not easy being drunk all the time.
everyone would do it if it were easy.
leave.
so, enjoying married life?
an unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.
she doesn't deserve this.
deserve?
be careful with that.
start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
there's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
you're not me.
you want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
so you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
so she can have some happiness in her life. You have children.
how happy would you say you are?
not very.
but if it weren't for my children,
I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.
they're the reason I'm alive.
even Joffrey?
even Joffrey.
he was all I had once.
before Myrcella was born.
I used to spend hours looking at him.
his wisps of hair.
his tiny little hands and feet.
he was such a jolly little fellow.
you always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.
we should have known. Even then we should have known.
it's nonsense.
whenever he was with me, he was happy.
and no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey how it feels to have someone.
someone of your own.
how long does it go on?
until we've dealt with all our enemies.
every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
I'm telling you, that's what she did.
sounded like a cow in heat.
aye, not for long. - That's right.
black Walder shut her up right quick.
none of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
I'll tell you what, though.
the hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.
you sewed it on? - I did.
I bet there were 1, 000 men claiming they were the one.
it was me.
and Malcolm and Talbott.
well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time.
took the skin right with it.
what we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone.
give it a nice firm mooring and
what do you want?
mind if I keep warm? - Fuck off.
but I'm hungry.
does fuck off mean something different where you're from?
I've got money.
what kind of coin is that?
it's worth a lot.
sorry.
little shit.
fool!
where did you get the knife?
from you.
is that the first man you've killed?
the first man.
next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first.
Valar morghulis.
Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice.
you always knew who I was, what I am.
I have to go home now.
I know you won't hurt me.
you know nothing, Jon Snow.
I do know some things.
I know I love you.
I know you love me.
but I have to go home now.
I know how this must look.
what I meant was- - I swear to you, my lord
I'm not a lord, my dear.
not for many, many years.
every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles.
among other things.
what is your name?
Ah, for the gillyflower.
lovely.
Yes, my
Maester.
master.
Maester.
and the child?
she hasn't chosen a name yet.
his name is Sam.
do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
he's not my child, Maester Aemon.
she's one of Craster's wives.
I remember every word of the oath.
night gathers and my watch begins.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
the realms of men.
that means her as well as us.
we didn't build 500 miles of ice walls, 700 feet high to keep out men.
the night is gathering, Maester Aemon.
I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.
Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being.
we certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
thank you...
Maester.
I can cook and clean and I can
good.
Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.
I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
miles better.
we had 44 ravens at last count.
make sure they're all fed.
every one of them flies tonight.
to His Grace
king Stannis Baratheon.
Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit.
first night of the full moon.
why is there a G in night? I don't know. There just is.
well, your father's not going to go to that.
my books are better than these boring scrolls.
you could read about Balerion the Dread.
they say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.
I'd like to see that someday.
I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
his fangs were as long as bastard swords.
aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer.
but now that I'm your father's Hand again,
I have to keep him informed.
the king does not have time for this drudgery.
to all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.
noblemen. - "Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch...implores...
what is it?
why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?
stay here.
bar the door.
the usurper Robb Stark is dead.
betrayed by his bannerman.
and you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
I take no credit.
I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
your Grace, the world has got so far bent.
I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open.
I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil.
and you are not an evil man.
do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
and do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
on the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.
he had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.
dragons are magic, Ser Davos.
my enemies have made my kingdom bleed.
I will not forget that.
I will not forgive that.
I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
you do not need to burn the boy.
if what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark
and our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne.
a great gift requires a great sacrifice.
his name is Gendry.
he's a good lad.
a poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
what is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
everything.
the boy must die.
what are you doing? - You're leaving.
is this some kind of trick?
Yes, but not on you.
aim for that star. Don't stop.
there's bread and water. Go slow with it.
if you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater.
I know not to drink seawater.
row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest.
you'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
where should I go?
you must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
the gold cloaks are looking for me. They were looking for me for 20 years.
do they know your face? - No.
I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
the other way.
you ever been in a boat before? No.
you know how to swim? No.
don't fall out.
go on.
why are you doing this? Because it's right.
and because I'm a slow learner.
when you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.
horse approaching!
Halt! Halt!
Jon, it's us. I don't think he can see us.
hush, now. You're home.
carry him inside. Gently.
out of the way. Step aside, country boy.
people working here.
you don't deny it?
no.
I let him go.
your mercy saved the boy's life.
you feel good about that? Aye, I do.
you saved one innocent.
how many tens of thousands have you doomed?
there has got to be another way.
what other way?! Tell us about this other way.
I don't know, Your Grace.
I can't see the future in the fire.
very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.
I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,
first of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, - sentence you to die. - I understand.
but since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it.
you're gonna need me. - Take him away.
why am I gonna need you?
my king.
it's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
their Lord Commander is dead.
took a ranging party north and never made it back.
one lad did, though.
what he saw beyond the Wall
it's coming for all of us.
when did you learn to read?
Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
this War of Five Kings means nothing.
the true war lies to the north, my king.
death marches on the Wall.
only you can stop him.
you can't stop him alone.
you need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
I've made my decision.
he's right. You need him.
he has a part to play in the war to come.
you see, Ser Davos?
you've been saved by that fire god you like to mock.
you're in his army now.
they will come, Your Grace.
when they're ready. Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
you didn't conquer them.
you liberated them.
people learn to love their chains.
this is Daenerys Targaryen the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdom of Westeros, the Mother of Dragons,
it is to her you owe your freedom.
no.
you do not owe me your freedom.
I cannot give it to you.
your freedom is not mine to give.
it belongs to you and you alone.
if you want it back, you must take it for yourselves.
each and everyone of you.
Mhysa! - Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
what does it mean?
it is old Ghiscari, khaleesi.
it means "mother.
it's all right.
these people won't hurt me.
Mhysa! Mhysa!
fly
let me pass.
Mhysa.
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
you did this. You did this!
we have to leave. - Take him! Take him!
where is his wife?
Where's Sansa? Find her. Bar the gates of the city.
seize every ship in the harbor.
where is she? - No one leaves the capital!
no one!
get in. - Where are we going?
somewhere safe.
up you go, my lady.
you'll be fine.
you're stronger than you know.
lord Baelish? - Petyr.
are you hurt, my lady?
good. Good.
I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy.
the worst is past. - Lord Baelish.
I promised I'd get her to you safely. - Softly, my friend.
voices carry over water.
I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.
first you'll want your pay.
10, 000 was it? - 10, 000.
wait!
you don't want the queen to hear, do you?
1, 000 gold cloaks are searching for you.
and if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?
I didn't murder anyone. - I know. I know.
but you must admit it looks suspicious.
the king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
why did you kill him?
because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
he saved me.
saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
every one of them. And he did it all for gold.
money buys a man's silence for a time.
a bolt in the heart buys it forever.
he was helping me because I saved his life.
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother.
the last legacy of House Hollard.
I had it made a few weeks ago.
what did I once tell you about the capital?
we're all liars here.
come, my lady.
I know you've had a difficult day.
but you're safe now.
I promise you that.
you're safe with me and sailing home.
so am I the queen?
more than you were with Renly.
less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying.
in any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stop- it was horrible.
the world is overflowing with horrible things.
but they're all a tray of cakes next to death.
they brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know?
made me look at it. What was it like?
they took me to the Great Hall and there he was.
the man I'd married and suffered to father my children.
a great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.
there he was lying on a table.
one of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart.
another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast.
I must be cursed. - Nonsense.
your circumstances have improved markedly.
you may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.
but I would have been the queen.
our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us.
you did wonderful work on Joffrey.
the next one should be easier.
your brother is dead.
do you know what that means?
I'm not trying to trick you.
it means I'll become king.
Yes, you will become king.
what kind of king do you think you'll be?
a good king?
mm, I think so as well.
you've got the right temperament for it.
but what makes a good king? Hmm?
what is a good king's single most important quality?
this is hardly the place or the time.
holiness?
Baelor the Blessed was holy.
and pious.
he built this sept.
he also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles.
he ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
justice.
Yeah.
a good king must be just.
Orys I was just.
everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike.
but he wasn't just for long.
he was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother.
was that truly just of him?
to abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
no. - No.
what about strength? - Yes.
strength.
king Robert was strong.
he won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.
and he attended three small council meetings in 17 years.
he spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him.
so, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing.
what do they all lack?
wisdom. - Yes!
wisdom is what makes a good king. Yes.
but what is wisdom? Hmm?
a house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you.
how do you know which choice is wise and which isn't?
you've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
no. - No. Of course not.
a wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't.
you're young.
a wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.
and the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards.
your brother was not a wise king.
your brother was not a good king.
if he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive.
now, as the king, you will have to marry.
do you understand why?
a king needs a queen. Yes, but why?
to further the family line.
do you know how that happens? - Yes.
Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?
I don't think so.
it's all relatively straightforward.
how are you? - I'm all right.
you are. You will be.
I'll see to that.
please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
Yes, my lord. - All of you.
it was Tyrion.
he killed him.
he told me he would.
a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
that's what he said to me.
you saw it.
you saw Joff point at him just before he
I don't know what I saw.
avenge him.
avenge our son.
kill Tyrion.
Tyrion's my brother. Our brother.
there'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
I don't want a trial.
he'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance.
I want him dead.
please, Jaime.
you have to.
he was our son.
our baby boy.
you're a hateful woman.
why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
Jaime, not here, please.
please.
stop it.
stop it. Stop. Please - No.
stop it. Stop.
stop.
stop. It's not right.
it's not right. It's not right.
I don't care.
don't. - I don't care.
don't. Jaime, don't. - I don't care.
gonna rain soon.
where are we?
near Fairmarket, I think.
you think?
you don't have a map?
no, I don't have a map. - Maybe we should get one.
fine, Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.
how far is it to the Eyrie?
far. - And you're sure we're going the right way?
believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can.
get my gold, be on my way.
on your way where? - Why do you care?
might book passage across the Narrow Sea.
fight as a sellsword.
second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.
I'd like to see Braavos one day. Why Braavos?
I have friends there. I doubt it.
seven blessings to you.
what do you want? - What do I want? This is my land.
if I'm standing on it, it's my land.
we were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way.
forgive my father.
he was wounded fighting in the war.
our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
he's never been the same.
which house did he fight for?
the Tullys of Riverrun.
there's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight.
there's fresh hay in the barn.
and Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do.
we don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.
we ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty.
we ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door.
we ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil.
we ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.
you got to do all seven of the fuckers?
father!
we ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us.
we ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
and we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
I'm so sorry.
really good.
did you fight at the Twins? - Call that a fight?
slaughtering livestock more like.
the Red Wedding they're calling it.
Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.
he shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
guest right don't mean much anymore.
it means something to me.
the gods will have their vengeance.
Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did.
things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.
we had good years and bad years, same as anyone.
but we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver.
I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.
you got any ale?
afraid not.
how can a man not keep ale in his home?
you look like you could really swing that sword.
a real warrior with proper training.
those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you.
how would it be if you stayed on till the new moon?
I could use a man to help with the farmwork.
Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay.
and if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way.
meaning no offense.
what'll you pay?
I don't have much.
but I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.
fair wages for fair work?
what did you do?! - Get your horse saddled.
you told me you weren't a thief. - I wasn't.
he took us in. He fed us and you
aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew.
and they'll both be dead come winter.
you don't know that. - I do know it.
he's weak. He can't protect himself.
they'll both be dead come winter.
dead men don't need silver.
you're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
there's plenty worse than me.
I just understand the way things are.
how many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
raper. Raper.
horse thief.
ninth born son.
raper.
thief. Thief and raper.
there he is, Sam the Slayer.
going to visit your wildling whore?
she's not a whore. - No?
maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.
they all think I'm lying. About what?
killing the white walker.
you're not lying.
I'll never forget the way it screamed.
but you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a
a what?
well, a wildling.
my father hated that word.
it's not a very nice word, I suppose.
I don't know.
it makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?
so...
are you all right? No one bothering you?
I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes.
but no one's touched me if that's what you mean.
I worry about it sometimes.
all the time.
why do you worry about it?
100 men, one woman.
I've got other things to think about.
that's the only thing they think about.
you're being silly. - I'm not being silly.
there's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
what about you?
what about me?
I worry about you.
thank you.
for what? For worrying about me.
I don't know if you're safe here.
they're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here.
some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.
so what are you saying?
maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
are you bored of me?
bored of you?
I...
I want to protect you.
I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.
your Grace.
you're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
Joffrey? - The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire.
a leech filled with bastard blood.
a bastard you set free.
I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
I will find you an army, Your Grace.
I've been working day and night- - What progress have you made?
I've rallied House Peasebury to your cause.
house Peasebury.
house Musgood. - House Musgood.
and House Haigh. - House Haigh.
they don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.
we need to look east for ships and men.
10, 000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.
the Golden Company? - They've never broken a contract.
they're sellswords.
we're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight?
now the Red Woman's magic is real.
her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war.
soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground.
it's dirty on the ground.
we don't have any gold.
not yet.
if I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten.
I will not become a page in someone else's history book.
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos.
which means you're running out of time.
you're late.
I'm sorry, Princess. I thought you weren't coming.
the Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
you won't be a very good hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit.
that happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake.
bloody relentless, the both of you.
it's a new one today. Lots of tricky words.
but I think you can manage.
you'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.
the Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas, First Sword of Braavos.
thank you very much.
I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates.
you were a pirate once.
no, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.
what's the difference?
well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.
my father says a criminal is a criminal.
your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior.
so do the Braavosi.
you've sailed to Braavos? - Of course.
almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos.
I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father.
I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction
what was that for? - I need you to write a message.
you should write it yourself. It's good practice. It's too important for me.
I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
to the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
but that's not you. I need to get their attention.
go on. Write.
he's seen some adventures, hasn't he?
precious little thing. - Thank you.
what's his name? - Sam.
lovely.
that the daddy?
no. Where's the daddy?
he's dead.
Oh. Where you from?
north of here. North of here?
you a fucking wildling?
only room and board? - That's right.
she'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
could find other work for her, too.
no other work. - There'd be money.
give you a piece of it.
no other work.
I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.
you'll be safer here.
who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
you protected me north of the Wall. This is different.
they're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.
you have to trust me.
it's for the best.
best for you.
Oh, Gilly.
please don't.
greedy.
no?
I'm sorry. You're lovely,
I just never acquired the taste.
you're calling my beauty an acquired taste?
that's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.
your loss.
you like them both the same?
boys and girls? - Does that surprise you?
everyone has a preference.
then everyone is missing half the world's pleasure.
the gods made that and it delights me.
the gods made this and it delights me.
when it comes to war, I fight for Dorne.
when it comes to love, I don't choose sides.
I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.
what are you, 25?
children.
someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old.
that pretty ass of yours will sag.
your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears.
no one will want you anymore.
make sure you fucked your fill before that day.
did you?
he is a prince of Dorne.
girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
they will all have to line up behind you.
prince Oberyn. - Lord Tywin.
may we have the room?
call my name if you need me, lover.
would you like to sit?
no, thank you.
some wine? No, thank you.
I'm sorry about your grandson. - Are you?
I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father.
or his grandfather.
an awful way to die.
which way is that?
are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
some believe the king choked.
some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.
the king was poisoned.
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
I did. This is why I know.
your hatred for my family is rather well known.
you arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.
rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?
you spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived.
what did you discuss? You think we conspired together?
what did you discuss?
the death of my sister.
for which you blame me. She was raped and murdered by the Mountain.
the Mountain follows your orders.
of course I blame you. Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.
should I be concerned?
you are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that.
I am a man of reason.
if I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.
men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
so you deny involvement in Elia's murder?
categorically.
I would like to speak with the Mountain.
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
he might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
I could arrange for this meeting.
but you want something in return.
there will be a trial for my son.
and as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict.
I will preside.
mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
I would like you to be the third.
Why?
not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.
declared themselves enemies of the throne.
now they are our strongest allies.
well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.
asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.
I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
we are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold.
the king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.
a wildling army marches on the Wall.
and in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons.
before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros.
only the Dornish managed to resist
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
you're saying you need us?
that must be hard for you to admit.
we need each other.
you help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
apologies for the stench.
I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.
a noble effort.
they didn't find the candles, though.
a quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.
you're a good lad.
any word of Shae? I've heard nothing, my lord.
I suppose that's a good thing.
what are they saying about me out there?
you're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.
do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
no, my lord.
you didn't?
no. Gods, no.
the world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it.
I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination,
I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died.
trial in a fortnight.
have they announced the judges yet?
your father. - Of course.
who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
and Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
give it to my father.
he never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord.
anyone who might testify on your behalf.
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?
how generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.
my lord, she's gone.
gone? - No one's seen her since the wedding.
you don't think she...
no one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin.
whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it.
and with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty.
Podrick. - Yes, my lord?
they'll be following you now. - Who will?
I don't know. They. They. The ominous they.
the man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father.
maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.
sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.
whenever something bad happens to me,
I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.
but say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children.
she is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder.
which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.
any other witnesses, my lord?
Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
he's already been called as a witness for the queen.
of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
I've already asked, my lord.
they won't let him see you. - Why not?
they say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.
he's under investigation himself.
and my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
I'll ask, my lord.
there's something else, my lord.
a man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you.
said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.
ser Podrick Payne?
has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
I didn't tell them anything, my lord.
are you going to accept their offer?
my lord. - Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion.
if they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.
you've been good to me, my lord.
pod, the trial's in a fortnight.
they'll want an answer before that. I already gave them an answer, my lord.
I will not have you dying on my behalf.
do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block,
I don't want to see your head already mounted.
my lord. - Pod, I am giving you an order.
go and find my brother. Tell him I need him.
and get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late.
this is farewell.
farewell, my lord.
there has never lived a more loyal squire.
mother says it's time to eat.
what's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.
potatoes. - Potatoes.
well, no one boils a potato better than your mom.
has she got
the wildlings!
hide.
hide!
run
you know how to get to Castle Black?
Yes. Yes.
those your parents?
open your eyes.
I'm going to eat them.
do you hear me?
I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa.
go tell the crows at Castle Black.
we need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
Aye! Aye!
three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall.
seems like that would be a good lesson.
Aye!
if we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want.
they want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.
we have just over 100 men.
and that's including stewards and builders.
and me. We can't afford to lose a single man.
we must remember our first responsibility.
we are the watchers on the Wall.
there's got to be a way to protect them.
you're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow.
what do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?
mance Rayder is coming.
if the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1, 000 miles before they reach an army that can stop them.
we need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall.
that is our job.
Rangers returning.
help him.
thought you'd have blue eyes by now.
what took you so long?
we were held up. - By what?
chains.
we were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.
and the mutineers stayed? - They're not going anywhere.
they've got Craster's food and his wives.
poor girls.
never thought they'd miss their daddy.
Karl's running things now.
he's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.
we need to ride north and kill them all.
we just went over this, boy.
justice can wait. - It's not about justice.
I told the wildlings we had over 1, 000 men at Castle Black alone.
Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do.
how long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off?
mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet.
as soon as he gets his hands on them, he will.
then he'll throw his full strength at us.
and even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.
I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.
are they attacking?
a single rider.
a champion of Meereen.
they want you to send your own champion against him.
what is he doing?
I believe he means to...
he says that we're an army of men without man parts.
he claims you are no woman at all, but a man who...
hides his cock in his own asshole.
ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.
they're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
I have something to say to the people of Meereen.
first, I will need this one to be quiet.
do I have a champion?
allow me this honor, mother of dragons
I will not disappoint you
you are the commander of the unsullied
I cannot risk you
your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.
which is why you must remain by my side.
I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.
let me stand for you today as well. You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend.
I will not gamble with your life. I was the last to join your army.
I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied.
my mother was a whore. I come from nothing.
and before long, I will return to nothing.
let me kill this man for you.
very well.
you have quite an audience.
make it worth their while.
he is very brave, Your Grace. Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.
you sure you don't want a horse?
why would I want a horse?
horses are faster than men.
horses are dumber than men.
I am Daenerys stormborn
your masters may have told you lies about me
or they may have told you nothing
it does not matter
I have nothing to say to them
I speak only to you
first, I went to astapor
those who were slaves in Astapor
now stand behind me
free
next I went to Yunkai
those who were slaves in Yunkai
now stand behind me
free
now I have come to Meereen
I am not your enemy
your enemy is beside you
your enemy steals and murders your children
your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering
and commands
I do not bring you commands
I bring you a choice
and I bring your enemies what they deserve
forward
fire
my name is Grey Worm.
I come from the Summer "Ills.
Isles.
summer Isles.
summer Isles.
I am from an island called Naath.
when they took you?
when did they take me?
I was five years old.
you remember your home?
I remember when they rowed us away from shore.
how white the beaches were.
how tall the trees.
and I remember my village burning.
smoke rising into the sky.
do you remember your home?
Unsullied.
always Unsullied.
before Unsullied, nothing.
that's not true.
perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
I don't want return.
kill the masters.
kill the masters.
how are the lessons coming?
very well, Your Grace.
Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
you'll have to continue later.
it's time.
you HEARD HER
she SAID SHE CAME TO FREE US
U R A FOOL
the MASTERS ARE TOO STRONG
she WILL PROTECT US
she DEFEATED THE MASTERS' CHAMPION
she HAS A GREAT ARMY
you WANT TO LIVE THE REST OF YOUR DAYS IN CHAINS?
I WANT TO LIVE
you SAW WHAT THEY DID TO THOSE CHILDREN
what DO YOU THINK THEY'LL DO TO US?
I've BEEN THROUGH TWO SLAVE REVOLTS, BOY
they ALWAYS END THE SAME WAY:
the MASTERS IN POWER AND SLAVES DEAD
all MEN MUST DIE
but I PROMISE YOU,
a SINGLE DAY OF FREEDOM IS WORTH MORE THAN A LIFETIME IN CHAINS
who R U
this ONE IS CALLED GREY WORM
I WAS TEKEN AS A BABY BY THE MASTERS OF ASTAPOR
raised AND TRAINED AS UNSULLIED
now I FIGHT FOR DAENERYS
the MOTHER OF DRAGONS
and BREAKER OF CHAINS
U R UNSULLIED?
they TAUGHT YOU HOW TO FIGHT BEFORE YOU COULD WALK
we ARE NOT SOLDIERS
we HAVE NO TRAINING
no WEAPONS
there ARE THREE SLAVES IN THIS CITY FOR EVERY MASTER
no ONE CAN GIVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM, BROTHERS
if YOU WANT IT
U MUST TAKE IT
kill THE MASTERS
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
163, Khaleesi.
Yes, that was it.
your Grace, may I have a word?
the city is yours.
all these people, they're your subjects now.
sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
I will answer injustice with justice.
what the hell was that?
that was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
you're a rare talent.
when you're fighting cripples, anyway.
you learned to fight like a good little boy.
I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.
you want to fight pretty or you want to win?
you talk to my brother this way?
all the time.
he got used to it.
do you think he did it?
no.
Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.
but who didn't?
and poison's not his style.
or murder, for that matter.
you want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?
you haven't been to see him yet, eh?
we're done for today.
your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
you stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
Aye.
but only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.
you were his first choice.
he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.
you gonna fight for him now?
to tell you the truth, this isn't so bad.
four walls. A pot to piss in.
I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
maybe a bit.
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
it's complicated, yes.
so how is our sister? - How do you think?
her son died in her arms.
her son?
don't.
you know what's coming?
my trial for regicide. Yes, I know.
I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty.
I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count.
and that judge is my father.
as for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
now that you mention it, she did ask.
so, should I turn around and close my eyes?
depends.
did you do it?
the Kingslayer brothers.
you like it? I like it.
you're really asking if I killed your son?
are you really asking if I'd kill my brother?
how can I help you?
well, you could set me free.
you know I can't.
then there's really nothing else to say.
what do you want me to do? Kill the guards?
sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart?
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
sorry, I'd forgotten.
I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
inappropriate?
you're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason.
except I didn't do it.
which is why we're having a trial.
a trial.
if the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
she won't rest until my head's on a spike.
not just yours.
she's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
Sansa couldn't have done this.
she had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
no, but...
Sansa's not a killer.
not yet, anyway.
where are you taking me?
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.
she's waiting for us at the Eyrie.
you'll be safe there.
did you kill Joffrey?
did I kill Joffrey?
I've been in the Vale for weeks.
I know it was you.
and who helped me with this conspiracy?
well, there was Ser Dontos.
you used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.
why not?
because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
then perhaps it was your husband.
no.
how do you know?
I just do.
you're right.
he wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.
but you were.
do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?
I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
the poison.
I don't understand.
the Lannisters gave you wealth, power.
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
a man with no motive is a man no one suspects.
always keep your foes confused.
if they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.
I don't believe you.
if they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's.
you'd risk that just to confuse them?
so many men, they risk so little.
they spend their lives avoiding danger.
and then they die.
I'd risk everything to get what I want.
and what do you want?
everything.
my friendship with the Lannisters was productive.
but Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally.
and who could trust a friend like that?
who could trust you?
I don't want friends like me.
my new friends are predictable.
very reasonable people.
as for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly.
nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.
I can't believe you're going.
leaving me alone here with these people.
the time has come, my dear.
there's nothing more tedious than a trial.
except perhaps these gardens.
if I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
have you been to see Tommen yet?
no.
have they even agreed to the match?
no one tells me anything.
I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know.
he was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola.
I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.
marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.
but the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.
so the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister,
I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
how absentminded of me. - Mm-hmm.
the following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
and once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before.
I was good.
I was very, very good.
you are even better.
but you need to act quickly.
Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.
she'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.
and by the time you're married, it'll be too late.
luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment.
mourning her dear departed boy.
accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.
well, he could have done.
he could have done, but he didn't.
you don't know, Grandmother. - But I do know.
you don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?
what? I don't understand.
Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that.
you just do what needs to be done.
bring it through!
and again.
very nice. Good.
a lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.
first thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
let's see what you can do.
Olly, you just watch for now.
I can fight.
have you ever held a sword before?
I was the best archer in our hamlet.
I was!
I believe you.
we'll go hunting for rabbits one day.
RIT now, watch and learn.
you two.
take it slow, try and disarm each other.
you know how to fight.
you could have gone easier on him.
he wouldn't have learned anything that way.
lord Snow
what do you think you're doing?
Grenn and I were helping them.
Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.
maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.
someone has to train them.
and that someone isn't you.
go find a chamber pot to empty.
go on. Do it.
you traitor's bastard.
give me an excuse.
Mormont's not here to protect you now.
get back to work.
now!
I said now!
the bastard's well-liked. You're not.
you think I care if they like me? We're at war.
for now.
but you can't be acting commander forever.
there will be a choosing.
the old maester will insist on it.
you might reconsider his request to march on Craster's.
let the mutineers take care of Snow.
or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
a bastard, eh?
took you for highborn.
my father was highborn.
my mother wasn't.
name's Locke.
you fight well.
what brought you up here?
a sense of duty.
I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.
fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.
I was stupid enough to get caught.
chose the Wall over losing my hand.
figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
come on, get on with it.
what are you waiting for? Summer?
guess I was wrong.
you sent for me, Your Grace?
your Grace.
how formal of you.
how many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
ser Boros is on duty tonight.
tomorrow I believe-- - So one?
you have one man guarding the future king?
I promise you Tommen's safe.
we're protecting him.
the way you protected Joffrey?
why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
what? - I've been wondering for months.
ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.
why did she set you free?
you know why.
she'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
she hoped or did you promise?
I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.
so you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
I wanted to get back to you.
should I have told her to fuck off?
you didn't mean it, then?
you have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
Catelyn Stark's dead.
so if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
I know you went to see Tyrion.
that creature who murdered our son.
I had to see him.
I had to know for myself.
And?
he didn't do it, Cersei.
you've always pitied him.
our poor little brother.
abused by the world.
despised by his father and sister.
he'd kill us all if he could.
I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.
that will be all, Lord Commander.
ser Pounce?
how did you get past the Kingsguard?
Kingsguard.
I don't think you're supposed to be here.
mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.
word has it I'm to be your bride.
did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day?
before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another.
don't you think?
Yes.
but if my mother found out-- - It can be our secret. Hmm?
if we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.
so, Your Grace...
yes?
tell me a secret.
hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
that's Ser Pounce.
very handsome.
Joffrey didn't like him.
he threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.
that's very cruel.
you don't strike me as cruel.
no.
I don't think I am.
that's a relief.
because you know what happens when we marry?
we say our vows in front of the high septon.
and after the ceremony, there's a feast.
when we marry, I become yours.
forever.
it's getting late.
I should go.
may I come and visit you again?
Yeah, All right, then.
remember, our little secret.
ser Jaime Lannister.
knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year.
at the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II.
pardoned by Robert Baratheon.
thereafter known as the Kingslayer.
it's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages.
and there's still room left on mine.
Valyrian steel.
it's yours.
I can't accept this. - It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.
you'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.
you swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.
lady Stark's dead.
Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.
I've got something else for you.
I hope I got your measurements right.
I'll find her.
for Lady Catelyn.
and for you.
I almost forgot.
I have one more gift.
I don't need a squire.
of course you do.
he'll slow me down.
my brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here.
you're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
I won't slow you down, sir
my lady.
I promise I'll serve you well.
see? He's a good lad. You'll get along.
compliments of Lord Tyrion.
his axe from the Blackwater.
what are you waiting for, a kiss?
ready the lady's horse.
they say the best swords have names.
any ideas?
Oathkeeper.
good-bye, Brienne.
come on, move.
I should never have taken her away.
she wasn't safe here. - She's not safe out there.
I should have known.
you told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.
if they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.
castle Black could be next. - I should go back for Gilly.
we have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
and I remember who came after me and brought me home.
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.
when you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.
I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.
I tried. Really, I did.
how fast could they travel?
a crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
I don't know.
they'd pass wildling villages.
they could try to find shelter at one of them.
the wildlings have joined up with Mance.
every village or sheltered place will be deserted.
except...
Craster's?
you think Bran might have found-- - Snow.
I don't mean to interrupt.
Thorne wants to see you.
your foray to Craster's Keep,
I'll sanction it.
but I won't order anyone to go with you.
volunteers only.
thank you, Ser Alliser.
brothers.
I'm going beyond the Wall to Craster's Keep.
I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them.
I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.
there's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this.
our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does.
they know the Wall. They know our defenses.
if Mance learns what they know, we're lost.
but if that's not enough, then consider this.
if the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.
he lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.
stabbed in the back by cowards.
he deserved far better.
all we can give him now is justice.
who will join me?
I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
then let me say my vows.
if it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.
thank you, brothers.
no, don't.
don't, please.
please don't. Ow!
you're hurting me.
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
any command for us, Lord Commander?
what's that?
fuck 'em till they're dead?
did you hear that, boys?
fuck 'em till they're dead.
go outside and feed the beast.
we should kill that thing.
you should shut your fucking hole, ugly little cunt.
you look like a fucking ballsack.
ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face.
I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you.
know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing?
seven silvers.
they told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again.
none of them cocksuckers got away from me.
haven't lost a fight since I was nine.
maybe it's time.
what do you think, eh?
maybe you're the man.
eh, cunt?
I wouldn't stand a chance.
none of us would.
I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.
a fucking legend!
I would take any knight
any knight, any time.
fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.
a gift for the gods. - A gift for the gods.
a gift for the gods.
what the fuck is that?
Craster's last child. A boy.
what am I supposed to do with him?
what did Craster do with 'em?
kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him?
all right.
don't need another mouth to feed.
hand him over. - He didn't kill them.
he offered them. - To who?
to the gods.
the white walkers.
a gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
a gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
a gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
shut up!
so...
if it worked for him...
let's give the walkers what they want.
Rast is headed that way.
pink-eyed fuck.
you thirsty?
fuck!
do you hear that?
is that a baby?
it's coming.
I'm going out there.
no, we need to stay together.
I'm going.
Hodor. - Bran, what happened?
summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.
who?
I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf.
they have Ghost.
they're Night's Watch.
look.
jon might be here.
if Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?
they might have been Night's Watch once, not anymore.
we're not safe here. We need to go.
no.
bran, we need to go now.
I'm not leaving without Summer.
can you remember where the cage was?
the east side of the keep.
if I'm not back soon, we'll meet
???????????????
if I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.
help him up.
this is nice.
fine leather.
you're no wildling.
important. Highborn.
who are you?
you see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you,
I'd lose my right hand.
but we're a long way from home, aren't we?
and the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods.
isn't that a bit odd?
I like your curly hair.
my mom had curls like that.
beautiful brown curls.
why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
see you haven't played this game before.
a highborn hostage, that's valuable.
but three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.
what the fuck's wrong with him?
come here.
no, please.
please. Please, let me help him.
who are you? - Please.
who are you? - I'm Brandon Stark!
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
it's Jon Snow's brother.
it's Meera. It's Meera. I'm right here.
and I thought this was gonna be another boring day.
I'm right here.
my name is Grey Worm.
I come from the Summer "Ills.
Isles.
summer Isles.
summer Isles.
I am from an island called Naath.
when they took you?
when did they take me?
I was five years old.
you remember your home?
I remember when they rowed us away from shore.
how white the beaches were.
how tall the trees.
and I remember my village burning.
smoke rising into the sky.
do you remember your home?
Unsullied.
always Unsullied.
before Unsullied, nothing.
that's not true.
perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
I don't want return.
kill the masters.
kill the masters.
how are the lessons coming?
very well, Your Grace.
Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
you'll have to continue later.
it's time.
you HEARD HER
she SAID SHE CAME TO FREE US
U R A FOOL
the MASTERS ARE TOO STRONG
she WILL PROTECT US
she DEFEATED THE MASTERS' CHAMPION
she HAS A GREAT ARMY
you WANT TO LIVE THE REST OF YOUR DAYS IN CHAINS?
I WANT TO LIVE
you SAW WHAT THEY DID TO THOSE CHILDREN
what DO YOU THINK THEY'LL DO TO US?
I've BEEN THROUGH TWO SLAVE REVOLTS, BOY
they ALWAYS END THE SAME WAY:
the MASTERS IN POWER AND SLAVES DEAD
all MEN MUST DIE
but I PROMISE YOU,
a SINGLE DAY OF FREEDOM IS WORTH MORE THAN A LIFETIME IN CHAINS
who R U
this ONE IS CALLED GREY WORM
I WAS TEKEN AS A BABY BY THE MASTERS OF ASTAPOR
raised AND TRAINED AS UNSULLIED
now I FIGHT FOR DAENERYS
the MOTHER OF DRAGONS
and BREAKER OF CHAINS
U R UNSULLIED?
they TAUGHT YOU HOW TO FIGHT BEFORE YOU COULD WALK
we ARE NOT SOLDIERS
we HAVE NO TRAINING
no WEAPONS
there ARE THREE SLAVES IN THIS CITY FOR EVERY MASTER
no ONE CAN GIVE YOU YOUR FREEDOM, BROTHERS
if YOU WANT IT
U MUST TAKE IT
kill THE MASTERS
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!
remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
163, Khaleesi.
Yes, that was it.
your Grace, may I have a word?
the city is yours.
all these people, they're your subjects now.
sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
I will answer injustice with justice.
what the hell was that?
that was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
you're a rare talent.
when you're fighting cripples, anyway.
you learned to fight like a good little boy.
I'll bet that thrust through the Mad King's back was pretty as a picture.
you want to fight pretty or you want to win?
you talk to my brother this way?
all the time.
he got used to it.
do you think he did it?
no.
Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.
but who didn't?
and poison's not his style.
or murder, for that matter.
you want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?
you haven't been to see him yet, eh?
we're done for today.
your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
you stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
Aye.
but only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.
you were his first choice.
he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.
you gonna fight for him now?
to tell you the truth, this isn't so bad.
four walls. A pot to piss in.
I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
maybe a bit.
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
it's complicated, yes.
so how is our sister? - How do you think?
her son died in her arms.
her son?
don't.
you know what's coming?
my trial for regicide. Yes, I know.
I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty.
I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count.
and that judge is my father.
as for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
now that you mention it, she did ask.
so, should I turn around and close my eyes?
depends.
did you do it?
the Kingslayer brothers.
you like it? I like it.
you're really asking if I killed your son?
are you really asking if I'd kill my brother?
how can I help you?
well, you could set me free.
you know I can't.
then there's really nothing else to say.
what do you want me to do? Kill the guards?
sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart?
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
sorry, I'd forgotten.
I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.
inappropriate?
you're accused of killing the king. Freeing you is treason.
except I didn't do it.
which is why we're having a trial.
a trial.
if the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
she won't rest until my head's on a spike.
not just yours.
she's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
Sansa couldn't have done this.
she had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
no, but...
Sansa's not a killer.
not yet, anyway.
where are you taking me?
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.
she's waiting for us at the Eyrie.
you'll be safe there.
did you kill Joffrey?
did I kill Joffrey?
I've been in the Vale for weeks.
I know it was you.
and who helped me with this conspiracy?
well, there was Ser Dontos.
you used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.
why not?
because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
then perhaps it was your husband.
no.
how do you know?
I just do.
you're right.
he wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.
but you were.
do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?
I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
the poison.
I don't understand.
the Lannisters gave you wealth, power.
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
a man with no motive is a man no one suspects.
always keep your foes confused.
if they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.
I don't believe you.
if they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's.
you'd risk that just to confuse them?
so many men, they risk so little.
they spend their lives avoiding danger.
and then they die.
I'd risk everything to get what I want.
and what do you want?
everything.
my friendship with the Lannisters was productive.
but Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally.
and who could trust a friend like that?
who could trust you?
I don't want friends like me.
my new friends are predictable.
very reasonable people.
as for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly.
nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.
I can't believe you're going.
leaving me alone here with these people.
the time has come, my dear.
there's nothing more tedious than a trial.
except perhaps these gardens.
if I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.
have you been to see Tommen yet?
no.
have they even agreed to the match?
no one tells me anything.
I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know.
he was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola.
I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.
marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.
but the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.
so the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister,
I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
how absentminded of me. - Mm-hmm.
the following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.
and once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before.
I was good.
I was very, very good.
you are even better.
but you need to act quickly.
Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid.
she'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.
and by the time you're married, it'll be too late.
luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment.
mourning her dear departed boy.
accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.
well, he could have done.
he could have done, but he didn't.
you don't know, Grandmother. - But I do know.
you don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?
what? I don't understand.
Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that.
you just do what needs to be done.
bring it through!
and again.
very nice. Good.
a lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.
first thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
let's see what you can do.
Olly, you just watch for now.
I can fight.
have you ever held a sword before?
I was the best archer in our hamlet.
I was!
I believe you.
we'll go hunting for rabbits one day.
RIT now, watch and learn.
you two.
take it slow, try and disarm each other.
you know how to fight.
you could have gone easier on him.
he wouldn't have learned anything that way.
lord Snow
what do you think you're doing?
Grenn and I were helping them.
Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.
maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.
someone has to train them.
and that someone isn't you.
go find a chamber pot to empty.
go on. Do it.
you traitor's bastard.
give me an excuse.
Mormont's not here to protect you now.
get back to work.
now!
I said now!
the bastard's well-liked. You're not.
you think I care if they like me? We're at war.
for now.
but you can't be acting commander forever.
there will be a choosing.
the old maester will insist on it.
you might reconsider his request to march on Craster's.
let the mutineers take care of Snow.
or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
a bastard, eh?
took you for highborn.
my father was highborn.
my mother wasn't.
name's Locke.
you fight well.
what brought you up here?
a sense of duty.
I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.
fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.
I was stupid enough to get caught.
chose the Wall over losing my hand.
figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
come on, get on with it.
what are you waiting for? Summer?
guess I was wrong.
you sent for me, Your Grace?
your Grace.
how formal of you.
how many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
ser Boros is on duty tonight.
tomorrow I believe-- - So one?
you have one man guarding the future king?
I promise you Tommen's safe.
we're protecting him.
the way you protected Joffrey?
why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
what? - I've been wondering for months.
ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.
why did she set you free?
you know why.
she'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
she hoped or did you promise?
I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.
so you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
I wanted to get back to you.
should I have told her to fuck off?
you didn't mean it, then?
you have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
Catelyn Stark's dead.
so if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
I know you went to see Tyrion.
that creature who murdered our son.
I had to see him.
I had to know for myself.
And?
he didn't do it, Cersei.
you've always pitied him.
our poor little brother.
abused by the world.
despised by his father and sister.
he'd kill us all if he could.
I want four men at Tommen's door day and night.
that will be all, Lord Commander.
ser Pounce?
how did you get past the Kingsguard?
Kingsguard.
I don't think you're supposed to be here.
mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.
word has it I'm to be your bride.
did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day?

don't you think?
Yes.
but if my mother found out-- - It can be our secret. Hmm?

he offered them. - To who?
to the gods.
the white walkers.
a gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
a gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
a gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.
shut up!
so...
if it worked for him...
let's give the walkers what they want.
Rast is headed that way.
pink-eyed fuck.
you thirsty?
fuck!
do you hear that?
is that a baby?
it's coming.
I'm going out there.
no, we need to stay together.
I'm going.
Hodor. - Bran, what happened?
summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.
who?
I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf.
they have Ghost.
they're Night's Watch.
look.
jon might be here.
if Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?
they might have been Night's Watch once, not anymore.
we're not safe here. We need to go.
no.
bran, we need to go now.
I'm not leaving without Summer.
can you remember where the cage was?
the east side of the keep.
if I'm not back soon, we'll meet
???????????????
if I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.
help him up.
this is nice.
fine leather.
you're no wildling.
important. Highborn.
who are you?
you see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you,
I'd lose my right hand.
but we're a long way from home, aren't we?
and the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods.
isn't that a bit odd?
I like your curly hair.
my mom had curls like that.
beautiful brown curls.
why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
see you haven't played this game before.
a highborn hostage, that's valuable.
but three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.
what the fuck's wrong with him?
come here.
no, please.
please. Please, let me help him.
who are you? - Please.
who are you? - I'm Brandon Stark!
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
it's Jon Snow's brother.
it's Meera. It's Meera. I'm right here.
and I thought this was gonna be another boring day.
I'm right here.
may the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times.
may the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden
and may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.
in the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name
king of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
long may he reign!
long may he reign!
special day.
your Grace.
your Grace.
your Grace. - Your Grace.
your Grace.
your Grace.
there he is.
long may he reign. -Long may he reign.
he sits the throne like he was born to it.
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?
no, he wasn't.
you still mourn for Joffrey?
he was my husband. My king.
he would have been your nightmare.
your Grace, I feel
you knew exactly what he was.
I did, too.
you never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.
doesn't matter what they do.
and what he did, it shocked me.
do you think I'm easily shocked?
no.
the things he did shocked me.
he's only a boy.
a good boy. A decent boy. He always has been.
who was the last decent king, I wonder?
he could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.
it would be some consolation, wouldn't it?
for all the horror that put him there.
he will need help...
if he's going to rule well.
he has you.
a mother is not enough.
you're still interested in being queen, I take it?
after all that's happened
it sounds strange, I know, but I am
I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next.
it would be a great honor, of course.
but I will have to speak to my father about it.
Yes, speak to your father.
I'll speak to mine.
we may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
I won't even know what to call you.
sister?
or Mother?
king Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
murdered at his own wedding.
and we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.
the Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.
who told you to take the navy?
no one.
so why did you do it?
I heard you liked ships.
how many ships?
93, Your Grace. How many men can they carry?
9, 300, not counting sailors.
would that be enough to take King's Landing? The Lannisters have more.
they've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.
they're tired, dispersed.
and now their king is dead.
8, 000 Unsullied, 2, 000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
it's hard to say. It could be enough.
but we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.
10, 000 men can't conquer Westeros.
the old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
the old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
there's other news.
from Yunkai.
without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.
they've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.
and in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself His Imperial Majesty.
please leave me.
not you, Jorah.
it appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
you could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne.
a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.
they've never been more vulnerable.
you counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.
I didn't listen.
that all worked out well.
how can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay?
why should anyone trust me?
why should anyone follow me?
you're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
I need to be more than that.
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.
I will not sail for Westeros. What, then?
I will do what queens do.
I will rule.
pull up your hood.
a memorable shade.
but how would they know?
you know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?
ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
is this the only way into the Eyrie? The mountains are impassable.
if you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.
it doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats.
the first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.
and the fortress they built here has never been overcome.
not once in 1, 000 years.
know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10, 000.
who would pass the Bloody Gate?
lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
stand to.
stand to! - Stand to!
welcome back, Lord Baelish.
uncle Petyr!
my lord.
I have brought you a gift.
lord Baelish.
my lady. - Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
a beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.
my name is Al
Oh, do take down that hood, child.
don't you think know who you are?
you think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was?
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
my flesh and blood.
it's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
you mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
of course. I understand.
no one can know you're here.
it would put us in a very precarious position.
I would never say a thing.
the Lannisters want to destroy us.
they've been trying for years.
now they know what it feels like.
mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
they did, and my father's.
they killed my father, too, with poison.
I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.
make him fly?
through the Moon Door.
and on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
they did. They made us both.
lord Tyrion didn't want to. I don't believe that for a moment.
did he force himself on you?
no.
we never- Good.
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.
but you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand?
Sansa, this is my son Robin.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
take the back stairs.
go. We'll speak soon.
what took you so long?
arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
she's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
let's get married tonight.
ought we not...
inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
there's only one Lord of the Vale.
the others can all hang.
lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
I do think that we could wait until- I'm done waiting, Petyr.
we had our wedding night many years ago.
or don't you remember?
like it was yesterday.
what wife would do for you the things I've done for you?
what wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?
when you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine
when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters
the deed is done.
faded into nothing.
only speaking of it can make it real.
tonight it is, then.
let me bathe and dress for the occasion.
once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.
I'm warning you.
I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.
I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
when will the wedding take place in your mind?
as soon as decency permits.
after we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
a fortnight? - That seems reasonable.
no jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.
and your wedding to Loras?
shortly after Tommen's.
shortly? - A fortnight.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't like your husband.
used to pat me on the back a lot.
I didn't trust him. We had that in common.
you don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
then whom can we trust?
ourselves alone.
the Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
robert wasn't particularly rich.
robert had me funding him.
wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
haven't a clue. Go on, your best guess.
pounds, tons, ounces?
doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
that can't be.
our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
then how do we pay for anything?
the crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
how much?
a tremendous amount.
there must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
the Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
and a temple is comprised of stones.
one stone crumbles and another takes its place.
and the temple holds its form for 1, 000 years or more.
that's what the Iron Bank is- a temple.
we all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.
you can't run from them. You can't cheat them.
you can't sway them with excuses.
if you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.
vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.
it's for the good of the family, I understand that.
I'm not sure my brothers do.
I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.
and as a mother, that is your right.
but as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
I respect that.
we don't need to discuss it.
the Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.
you've started wars to protect this family.
turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.
what does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
the Red Woman.
thoros of Myr.
the Mountain.
would you shut up?
I can't sleep until I say the names.
the names of every fucking person in Westeros?
only the ones I'm going to kill.
hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.
better than most.
we come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
if he were here right now, what would you do?
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep.
go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
I'm almost done.
only one name left.
go on.
the Hound.
thank you.
your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
Really? - Oh, yes.
at suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard.
anything sweet.
eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.
cat was the firstborn daughter after all.
it was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
my mother fat?
she never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
this is before she married your father and moved to the North.
by the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.
marriage changes people.
I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them.
how do you like them?
they're delicious.
where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
Oh, gods, no.
Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.
he knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind.
he really cares for you.
think where you'd be without him.
in their clutches and tried for murder.
Yes. I'M...I'm very lucky.
he feels responsible for you. - Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
Why?
why does he feel responsible for you?
well, I'm half Tully.
he loved your family so much. - Loved your mother.
no. - That's what you wanted to say.
he loves you, Aunt Lysa.
he's married to you. - Your mother never loved him. Never.
cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.
the most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.
your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.
he almost killed Petyr in a duel.
and your mother loved him anyway.
and now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels.
has he told you about them? - No.
he hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies?
the vile things they let him do with their bodies?
no, never. - Are you pregnant?
what? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.
what have you let Petyr do with your body?
aunt Lysa, no, I- - Your young, pretty body.
nothing. I'm a virgin. - Don't lie to me.
you're hurting me.
I'll know if you lie.
I'm a virgin, I swear it.
he loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid.
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth.
and I swear to you that he has never touched me.
not once, not ever. - Shh. Shh. Shh.
it's all right.
it will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon.
they'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin.
you'll be the Lady of the Vale.
didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
Yes, my lady, when I was young.
there wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though.
he preferred litters.
perhaps you should have stayed with him.
it's not going to be a pleasant journey for you.
it could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
that's a long way off.
well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black.
if I were her, that's where I'd go.
feel free to stop at any point.
never, my lady. I'm your squire.
I've made it this far in the world without a squire.
I don't see why I need one now.
all knights have squires, my lady.
I'm not a knight.
and I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.
I swore an oath, my lady.
I am releasing you from that oath.
that means you could leave.
I know.
what do you think will happen if you leave?
they'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
the hell you doing? - Practicing.
what, ways to die? - No one's going to kill me.
they will if you nance around like that.
that's no way to fight.
it's not fighting. It's water dancing.
dancing?
maybe you ought to put on a dress.
who taught you that shite?
the greatest swordsman who ever lived.
Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
Braavos.
greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.
they all are.
what do you know about anything?
I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
it was not. - Was? He dead?
Yes. - How?
he was killed. - Who by?
Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn
the greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
he was outnumbered. - Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
the greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword?
all right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you.
go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.
dead like all the rest of your friends.
your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
your Grace.
prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
a poem, actually.
may I show you the gardens?
I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
no, you couldn't.
I didn't realize you were a poet.
not a very good one.
for your paramour?
for one of my daughters.
you have several, don't you?
eight.
eight?
eight daughters?
the fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
beautiful name.
Yes.
but I can't say it without turning sad.
and after I turn sad,
I grow angry.
perhaps that's why she's difficult.
the gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?
which joke is that?
you're a prince of Dorne.
a legendary fighter.
a brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.
but you could not save your sister.
I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years.
daughter of the most powerful man alive.
but I could not save my son.
what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
we can avenge them.
Yes, we can avenge them.
you really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
I know he did.
we will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
we'll have a trial, anyway.
I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
the last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens.
laughing in the sun.
I want to believe that.
I want to believe she's happy.
you have my word.
we don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls.
would you bring her a gift for me?
I wasn't there for her name day.
I don't know when I'll see her again.
anything at all.
the best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months.
Myrcella loves the open water.
I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
please tell her...
her mother misses her very much.
Oh, no, no, no.
no, no, no, no.
hells.
gods.
did you remove the skin?
no, my lady. Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
no, my lady.
did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
no, my lady.
that was the cooks.
what are you doing? I'm helping you with your armor.
I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.
what exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished.
I kept his clothing and linens clean.
carried his messages and returned the replies.
mostly I poured wine.
whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
I killed a man.
who?
a Kingsguard.
he tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
how did you kill a Kingsguard?
I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
bloody ridiculous.
help me with these straps.
Hey, get up.
get up.
that's it lad, put it inside.
get the fire going again. We're all freezing.
Aye. What we need is a girl there.
I've got to have a piss.
now keep quiet.
you need water.
it doesn't matter.
of course it matters.
you mustn't let anything stop you.
they already have stopped me.
no.
you're not here.
you're far from here.
what does that mean?
at the hill.
a great weirwood tree.
you've seen it, too.
meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you.
he's waiting for you.
we have to find it.
you have to make it.
we will.
this- this isn't the end.
not for you.
not yet.
how...
will we know the end?
you'll know.
brothers.
you do move quiet.
how many? - 11 men.
most of them already drunk.
no guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world.
we'll carve them up like walnut pie.
Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.
I've seen what he can do with a knife.
have you seen what I can do with a knife?
not yet.
there's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
Why?
they've got some hounds chained up inside.
closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.
new moon tonight.
get some rest.
we move at sundown.
I've always liked a girl with curls.
a touch of class.
you take whatever's left.
get her up.
stop.
stop. What are you doing?
stop. Stop!
Hodor. Hodor. - Stop!
please. - Hodor.
please, get off her! - Hodor. Hodor.
please! Please, leave her alone!
please, stop. Stop.
what are you doing? Leave her alone! - Hodor. Hodor.
No! - Shh.
you've got pretty hair, don't you?
now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?
you left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you?
no dresses for you.
you like it rough, don't you?
you like it in the gutter, don't you?
if you let my sister go, I can help you.
you can help me?
I can.
and how you gonna do that?
I have the sight. I can see things.
that's very helpful.
things that haven't happened yet.
what a fine thing.
a fine thing.
have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister?
have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
no.
don't close your eyes.
I saw you die tonight.
I saw your body burn.
I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
to arms!
they're here, the Night's Watch.
rescue party is here, lads.
lady.
is Jon with you? - Aye.
I'll take you to him.
you're Brandon Stark?
the little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.
keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats.
starting with the idiot. Do you hear?
do you hear?
Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.
Hodor, get his knife. - Hodor.
cut me loose, Hodor.
Jojen and Meera, free them.
go!
if he sees you, he won't let you go north.
he's my brother. - And wants to protect you.
he'll take you back to Castle Black.
you have to decide.
do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
we need to free Summer.
and we need to go.
lord Snow.
are you bringing me back for trial?
we had a good thing here.
we were free men.
you'll never be free.
you'll never know what that's like.
you learn how to fight in a castle?
some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?
how to fight with honor?
you know what's wrong with honor?
you.
are you all right?
come with me.
come on.
we lost four brothers?
five.
what the seven hells could do that to a man?
I count 10 dead mutineers.
locke said there were 11 of them.
Where's Rast?
here's another. - Jon.
where in seven hells?
come here.
I missed you, boy.
what should we do with this lot?
it's not safe for you here on your own.
mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance.
come with us to Castle Black.
we can find you work. Keep you safe.
meaning all respect, Ser Crow,
Craster beat us and worse.
your brother crows beat us and worse.
we'll find our own way.
you want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
may the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times.
may the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden
and may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.
in the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name
king of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
long may he reign!
long may he reign!
special day.
your Grace.
your Grace.
your Grace. - Your Grace.
your Grace.
your Grace.
there he is.
long may he reign. -Long may he reign.
he sits the throne like he was born to it.
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?
no, he wasn't.
you still mourn for Joffrey?
he was my husband. My king.
he would have been your nightmare.
your Grace, I feel
you knew exactly what he was.
I did, too.
you never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.
doesn't matter what they do.
and what he did, it shocked me.
do you think I'm easily shocked?
no.
the things he did shocked me.
he's only a boy.
a good boy. A decent boy. He always has been.
who was the last decent king, I wonder?
he could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.
it would be some consolation, wouldn't it?
for all the horror that put him there.
he will need help...
if he's going to rule well.
he has you.
a mother is not enough.
you're still interested in being queen, I take it?
after all that's happened
it sounds strange, I know, but I am
I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next.
it would be a great honor, of course.
but I will have to speak to my father about it.
Yes, speak to your father.
I'll speak to mine.
we may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
I won't even know what to call you.
sister?
or Mother?
king Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
murdered at his own wedding.
and we have taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.
the Second Sons took the Meereenese navy.
who told you to take the navy?
no one.
so why did you do it?
I heard you liked ships.
how many ships?
93, Your Grace. How many men can they carry?
9, 300, not counting sailors.
would that be enough to take King's Landing? The Lannisters have more.
they've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years.
they're tired, dispersed.
and now their king is dead.
8, 000 Unsullied, 2, 000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
it's hard to say. It could be enough.
but we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing.
10, 000 men can't conquer Westeros.
the old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
the old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
there's other news.
from Yunkai.
without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.
they've reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.
and in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself His Imperial Majesty.
please leave me.
not you, Jorah.
it appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
you could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne.
a boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.
they've never been more vulnerable.
you counseled me against rashness once in Qarth.
I didn't listen.
that all worked out well.
how can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay?
why should anyone trust me?
why should anyone follow me?
you're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
I need to be more than that.
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.
I will not sail for Westeros. What, then?
I will do what queens do.
I will rule.
pull up your hood.
a memorable shade.
but how would they know?
you know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?
ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
is this the only way into the Eyrie? The mountains are impassable.
if you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.
it doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats.
the first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.
and the fortress they built here has never been overcome.
not once in 1, 000 years.
know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10, 000.
who would pass the Bloody Gate?
lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
stand to.
stand to! - Stand to!
welcome back, Lord Baelish.
uncle Petyr!
my lord.
I have brought you a gift.
lord Baelish.
my lady. - Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
a beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.
my name is Al
Oh, do take down that hood, child.
don't you think know who you are?
you think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was?
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
my flesh and blood.
it's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
you mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
of course. I understand.
no one can know you're here.
it would put us in a very precarious position.
I would never say a thing.
the Lannisters want to destroy us.
they've been trying for years.
now they know what it feels like.
mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
they did, and my father's.
they killed my father, too, with poison.
I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.
make him fly?
through the Moon Door.
and on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
they did. They made us both.
lord Tyrion didn't want to. I don't believe that for a moment.
did he force himself on you?
no.
we never- Good.
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.
but you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand?
Sansa, this is my son Robin.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
take the back stairs.
go. We'll speak soon.
what took you so long?
arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
she's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
let's get married tonight.
ought we not...
inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
there's only one Lord of the Vale.
the others can all hang.
lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
I do think that we could wait until- I'm done waiting, Petyr.
we had our wedding night many years ago.
or don't you remember?
like it was yesterday.
what wife would do for you the things I've done for you?
what wife would trust you the way I've trusted you?
when you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine
when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters
the deed is done.
faded into nothing.
only speaking of it can make it real.
tonight it is, then.
let me bathe and dress for the occasion.
once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.
I'm warning you.
I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me.
I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
when will the wedding take place in your mind?
as soon as decency permits.
after we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
a fortnight? - That seems reasonable.
no jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals.
and your wedding to Loras?
shortly after Tommen's.
shortly? - A fortnight.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't like your husband.
used to pat me on the back a lot.
I didn't trust him. We had that in common.
you don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
then whom can we trust?
ourselves alone.
the Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
robert wasn't particularly rich.
robert had me funding him.
wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
haven't a clue. Go on, your best guess.
pounds, tons, ounces?
doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
that can't be.
our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
then how do we pay for anything?
the crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
how much?
a tremendous amount.
there must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
the Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
and a temple is comprised of stones.
one stone crumbles and another takes its place.
and the temple holds its form for 1, 000 years or more.
that's what the Iron Bank is- a temple.
we all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.
you can't run from them. You can't cheat them.
you can't sway them with excuses.
if you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.
vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.
it's for the good of the family, I understand that.
I'm not sure my brothers do.
I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion.
and as a mother, that is your right.
but as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
I respect that.
we don't need to discuss it.
the Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.
you've started wars to protect this family.
turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.
what does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
the Red Woman.
thoros of Myr.
the Mountain.
would you shut up?
I can't sleep until I say the names.
the names of every fucking person in Westeros?
only the ones I'm going to kill.
hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going.
better than most.
we come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
if he were here right now, what would you do?
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep.
go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
I'm almost done.
only one name left.
go on.
the Hound.
thank you.
your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?
Really? - Oh, yes.
at suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard.
anything sweet.
eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.
cat was the firstborn daughter after all.
it was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
my mother fat?
she never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
this is before she married your father and moved to the North.
by the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers.
marriage changes people.
I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them.
how do you like them?
they're delicious.
where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
Oh, gods, no.
Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing.
he knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind.
he really cares for you.
think where you'd be without him.
in their clutches and tried for murder.
Yes. I'M...I'm very lucky.
he feels responsible for you. - Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
Why?
why does he feel responsible for you?
well, I'm half Tully.
he loved your family so much. - Loved your mother.
no. - That's what you wanted to say.
he loves you, Aunt Lysa.
he's married to you. - Your mother never loved him. Never.
cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.
the most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.
your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.
he almost killed Petyr in a duel.
and your mother loved him anyway.
and now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels.
has he told you about them? - No.
he hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies?
the vile things they let him do with their bodies?
no, never. - Are you pregnant?
what? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.
what have you let Petyr do with your body?
aunt Lysa, no, I- - Your young, pretty body.
nothing. I'm a virgin. - Don't lie to me.
you're hurting me.
I'll know if you lie.
I'm a virgin, I swear it.
he loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid.
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth.
and I swear to you that he has never touched me.
not once, not ever. - Shh. Shh. Shh.
it's all right.
it will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon.
they'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin.
you'll be the Lady of the Vale.
didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
Yes, my lady, when I was young.
there wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though.
he preferred litters.
perhaps you should have stayed with him.
it's not going to be a pleasant journey for you.
it could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
that's a long way off.
well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black.
if I were her, that's where I'd go.
feel free to stop at any point.
never, my lady. I'm your squire.
I've made it this far in the world without a squire.
I don't see why I need one now.
all knights have squires, my lady.
I'm not a knight.
and I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.
I swore an oath, my lady.
I am releasing you from that oath.
that means you could leave.
I know.
what do you think will happen if you leave?
they'll say I wasn't a very good squire.
the hell you doing? - Practicing.
what, ways to die? - No one's going to kill me.
they will if you nance around like that.
that's no way to fight.
it's not fighting. It's water dancing.
dancing?
maybe you ought to put on a dress.
who taught you that shite?
the greatest swordsman who ever lived.
Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
Braavos.
greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.
they all are.
what do you know about anything?
I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.
it was not. - Was? He dead?
Yes. - How?
he was killed. - Who by?
Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn
the greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
he was outnumbered. - Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
the greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword?
all right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you.
go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.
dead like all the rest of your friends.
your friend's dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.
your Grace.
prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
a poem, actually.
may I show you the gardens?
I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.
no, you couldn't.
I didn't realize you were a poet.
not a very good one.
for your paramour?
for one of my daughters.
you have several, don't you?
eight.
eight?
eight daughters?
the fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.
beautiful name.
Yes.
but I can't say it without turning sad.
and after I turn sad,
I grow angry.
perhaps that's why she's difficult.
the gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?
which joke is that?
you're a prince of Dorne.
a legendary fighter.
a brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.
but you could not save your sister.
I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years.
daughter of the most powerful man alive.
but I could not save my son.
what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
we can avenge them.
Yes, we can avenge them.
you really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
I know he did.
we will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
we'll have a trial, anyway.
I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.
the last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens.
laughing in the sun.
I want to believe that.
I want to believe she's happy.
you have my word.
we don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls.
would you bring her a gift for me?
I wasn't there for her name day.
I don't know when I'll see her again.
anything at all.
the best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months.
Myrcella loves the open water.
I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
please tell her...
her mother misses her very much.
Oh, no, no, no.
no, no, no, no.
hells.
gods.
did you remove the skin?
no, my lady. Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
no, my lady.
did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
no, my lady.
that was the cooks.
what are you doing? I'm helping you with your armor.
I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.
what exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished.
I kept his clothing and linens clean.
carried his messages and returned the replies.
mostly I poured wine.
whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
I killed a man.
who?
a Kingsguard.
he tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
how did you kill a Kingsguard?
I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
bloody ridiculous.
help me with these straps.
Hey, get up.
get up.
that's it lad, put it inside.
get the fire going again. We're all freezing.
Aye. What we need is a girl there.
I've got to have a piss.
now keep quiet.
you need water.
it doesn't matter.
of course it matters.
you mustn't let anything stop you.
they already have stopped me.
no.
you're not here.
you're far from here.
what does that mean?
at the hill.
a great weirwood tree.
you've seen it, too.
meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you.
he's waiting for you.
we have to find it.
you have to make it.
we will.
this- this isn't the end.
not for you.
not yet.
how...
will we know the end?
you'll know.
brothers.
you do move quiet.
how many? - 11 men.
most of them already drunk.
no guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world.
we'll carve them up like walnut pie.
Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.
I've seen what he can do with a knife.
have you seen what I can do with a knife?
not yet.
there's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.
Why?
they've got some hounds chained up inside.
closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.
new moon tonight.
get some rest.
we move at sundown.
I've always liked a girl with curls.
a touch of class.
you take whatever's left.
get her up.
stop.
stop. What are you doing?
stop. Stop!
Hodor. Hodor. - Stop!
please. - Hodor.
please, get off her! - Hodor. Hodor.
please! Please, leave her alone!
please, stop. Stop.
what are you doing? Leave her alone! - Hodor. Hodor.
No! - Shh.
you've got pretty hair, don't you?
now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?
you left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you?
no dresses for you.
you like it rough, don't you?
you like it in the gutter, don't you?
if you let my sister go, I can help you.
you can help me?
I can.
and how you gonna do that?
I have the sight. I can see things.
that's very helpful.
things that haven't happened yet.
what a fine thing.
a fine thing.
have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister?
have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?
no.
don't close your eyes.
I saw you die tonight.
I saw your body burn.
I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
to arms!
they're here, the Night's Watch.
rescue party is here, lads.
lady.
is Jon with you? - Aye.
I'll take you to him.
you're Brandon Stark?
the little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.
keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats.
starting with the idiot. Do you hear?
do you hear?
Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.
Hodor, get his knife. - Hodor.
cut me loose, Hodor.
Jojen and Meera, free them.
go!
if he sees you, he won't let you go north.
he's my brother. - And wants to protect you.
he'll take you back to Castle Black.
you have to decide.
do you want to find the three-eyed raven?
we need to free Summer.
and we need to go.
lord Snow.
are you bringing me back for trial?
we had a good thing here.
we were free men.
you'll never be free.
you'll never know what that's like.
you learn how to fight in a castle?
some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?
how to fight with honor?
you know what's wrong with honor?
you.
are you all right?
come with me.
come on.
we lost four brothers?
five.
what the seven hells could do that to a man?
I count 10 dead mutineers.
locke said there were 11 of them.
Where's Rast?
here's another. - Jon.
where in seven hells?
come here.
I missed you, boy.
what should we do with this lot?
it's not safe for you here on your own.
mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance.
come with us to Castle Black.
we can find you work. Keep you safe.
meaning all respect, Ser Crow,
Craster beat us and worse.
your brother crows beat us and worse.
we'll find our own way.
you want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.
you're accused of killing the king.
I didn't do it.
which is why we're having a trial.
one of my three judges is my father.
mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I want you to be the third.
I will also invite you to sit on the Small Council.
I never realized you had such respect for Dorne.
what good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
you can avenge them.
you really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
you're still interested in being queen, I take it?
it would be a great honor.
but I will have to speak to my father about it.
I will speak to mine.
you started wars to protect this family's future.
Tyrion deserves for lighting our future to fire.
what kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
the kind who serves his king.
the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.
how many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?
I am loyal servant! - Throw him in one of the black cells.
Oh no, no, no, no.
there are many who know that without you, this city faced certain defeat.
the king won't give you any honors, but we will not forget.
the city is yours. All these people are your subjects now.
sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
I will answer injustice with justice.
you'll Find a special gift.
theon's favorite toy.
he cried when I took it away from him.
I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
and I'm going to bring him home.
we need to look East for ships and men.
soldiers win wars. - We don't have any gold.
I'm running out of time, Ser Davos, which means you're running out of time.
your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that
we've been here since midday.
easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found.
once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest
welcome to the Iron Bank.
please, sit.
what can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
this is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men,
lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
the Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon,
king of the Andals and the First Men,
lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
he shares no blood with me.
he is a bastard born of incest.
as was his brother before him.
Yes, we have heard this story.
it's not a story. It's the truth.
the king's grandfather tells a different story.
a story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
gold you loaned him.
and you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
more than any man living.
across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman" and "blood right.
here, our books are filled with numbers.
we prefer the stories they tell.
more plain.
less open to interpretation.
how many fighting men remain loyal to you?
4000
and how many ships do you have?
the ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
32
and how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4, 000 men on your 32 ships?
none.
you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective.
I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request.
but we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
my lord.
I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.
you would not be either here.
in Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving.
that would be the pirates.
I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
this is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting.
he's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.
which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.
the war is over.
as long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.
who's the real power in King's Landing?
ser Davos... - Humor me.
Tywin Lannister. - How old is Tywin Lannister?
67. - 67. And when he dies, who's in command?
a half-grown boy, the product of incest?
Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?
Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect?
when Tywin's gone, who do you back?
that is a problem for another time.
begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now.
there's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
he's got the birthright. He's in his prime.
he's a tried and tested battle commander.
and he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.
the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
the captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt."
the first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
and when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory.
a few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!"
the crew is shivering like scared mice.
but the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!"
after the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?"
the captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed."
the next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships!"
we are surrounded!
the crew goes silent.
they all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command.
calm as ever, the captain bellows...
bring me my brown pants!
you think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
only half rotted.
join us, my friend. Join us.
this is Lhara.
and this is- - I am Lhara.
she's an artist, this one, truly.
no time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.
we?
you, me- we.
once I thought this man loved me.
now I know he despises me.
he wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold
you won't be alone.
and you won't be poor.
there's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
I gave it to your wife.
you're not my friend, my friend.
I'll see you at sunrise.
I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home.
on the first night of the full moon,
I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
in the box you'll find a special gift

he cried when I took it away from him.

Yes!

Yes! Yes!
as long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.

I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.

No!
it's all right. It's me, Yara.

I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.
not Theon! Reek!
Reek! My name is Reek! - They're here.
if they catch us in here, we're trapped. - Help me with him.
no, you can't!
you can't! - You're Theon Greyjoy.
no, I don't believe her! I know who I am!
I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek!
good Reek! I've always been Reek!
this is turning into a lovely evening.
I'm Reek!
loyal Reek!
Theon!
give me my brother then no more of your men will die
you've got bigger balls than he ever did.
but with those big balls of yours...
how fast can you run?
make for the ship, now. - But your brother.
my brother is dead.
I have a treat for you.
a reward.
reward?
Yes, Reek.
those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away.
and you didn't let them.
you remained loyal.
I- I didn't want them to take me.
I was so scared.
I didn't want them- - Yes, yes, Reek.
it's a bath.
for you.
remove those rags.
now.
the britches, too, Reek.
take them off.
do you love me, Reek?
Yes, of course, my lord.
good.
because I need you to do something for me.
something very important.
there's a castle, you see.
some bad men hold this castle.
I need your help to take this castle back.
but how can
I need you to play a role.
to pretend to be someone you're not.
pretend to be who?
you stand before Daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen, the first of her name, the unburnt queen of meereen queen of the andals and the first men, khaleesi of the great grass sea, breaker of chains and mother of dragons.
don't be afraid, my friend.
the queen says you may approach and speak,
he is a goatherd.
he says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
I thank him for his prayers.
it was your dragons, he says.
they came this morning for his flock.
he hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
I cannot bring back his goats, but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
send the next one in.
the noble hizdahr zo loraq begs an audience with the queen.
the noble hizdahr zo loraq can speak to me himself
queen Daenerys.
tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
I thank you.
mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
then it is my honor to receive you.
my father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
this pyramid included.
for that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honored to meet him.
you have, Your Grace.
you crucified him.
I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
your father crucified innocent children.
my father spoke out against crucifying those children.
he decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.
is it justice to answer one crime with another?
I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
you'd be wise to remember that.
what's done is done.
you are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
a servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
and what traditions do you speak of?
the tradition of funeral rite.
proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
my father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
and what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?
they were rotting in the sun as well.
would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.
I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.
let me take his body down.
let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
thank you, my queen.
how many more?
there are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
send the next one in.
these meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they?
I was up late last night.
so, does this mean I am a master of something now?
coins, ships?
lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you
lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I
the trial begins this afternoon.
we only have the morning for affairs of state.
shall we begin?
sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
a coward and a traitor.
my birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.
I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.
disgraceful.
what would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
make it 100. What else?
more whispers from the east, my lord.
the Targaryen girl?
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
she has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
conquered with what? - She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.
some 8, 000 strong.
she has a company of sellswords- the Second Sons.
she has two knights advising her
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
and she has three dragons. - Baby dragons.
larger every year, Your Grace.
Mormont is spying on her for us.
no longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her.
as for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
he's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
Joffrey didn't die on his watch.
dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
a child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
lord Varys is right.
I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
they are very impressive on the battlefield.
less so in the bedroom.
dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.
armies win them all the time.
she must be dealt with.
how, my lord?
by force? - Eventually, if it comes to that.
can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
most certainly, my Lord Hand.
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
fetch my quill and paper.
prince Oberyn.
lord Varys...
only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.
no one is under obligation to call me lord.
and yet everyone does.
you seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
did you spend much time in Essos?
five years.
may I ask why?
tis a big and beautiful world.
most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it.
I don't want to be most of us.
most of us aren't princes.
you are from Essos.
where? Lys?
I have an ear for accents.
I've lost my accent entirely. - I have an ear for that as well.
how did you get here? - It's a long story.
one you don't like telling people.
people I trust.
my paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
you should come to the brothel and meet her.
we brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.
we have some lovely boys on retainer, but...
you did like boys before?
Really?
girls? Hmm.
I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
not at all.
but I was never interested in girls, either.
what then? - Nothing.
everybody is interested in something.
not me.
when I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country,
I am very glad to have no part in it.
besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
such as?
let me guess, I've been pardoned.
Really?
father's orders.
well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
Kingslayer!
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, first of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King,
protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.
and with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
and if found guilty...
may the gods punish the accused.
you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
did you kill King Joffrey?
no.
did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
not that I know of.
how would you say he died, then?
choked on his pigeon pie.
so you would blame the bakers?
or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
the crown may call its first witness.
once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.
he slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
it wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate.
and when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.
Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
silence. - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
Silence!
you will not speak unless called upon.
you're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance...
blind eye
I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.
you have a lot of poison in your store.
had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.
by whom?
by the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse.
was it without question poison that killed him?
without question.
this was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.
he was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.
she wore this necklace the day of the wedding.
residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
it was. The Strangler.
a poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
and used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
I will hurt you for this.
a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
your own brother said this to you?
shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
as it turned out, when the attack came,
Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.
he believed his presence would inspire the troops.
Tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid."
what debt?
I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.
I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs.
he wasn't pleased.
thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
I'm afraid I do, my lord.
he said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then."
monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
Yes.
after we received word of Robb Stark's death.
he didn't seem gladdened by the news.
perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
you're excused, Lord Varys.
father, may I ask the witness one question?
one.
you once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.
you said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget.
have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
sadly, my lord,
I never forget a thing.
we will adjourn for now.
toll the bells in an hour's time.
clear the court!
you'd condemn your own son to death?
I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
this isn't a trial. It's a farce.
Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
I know nothing of the sort.
you've always hated Tyrion. - He killed his king.
as did I.
do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?
to bring him your head.
I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
it won't be murder. It'll be justice. - Justice?
I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
if Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
he'll be executed. - No, he'll be punished accordingly.
once you said family is what lives on.
all that lives on.
you told me about a dynasty that would last 1, 000 years.
what happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?
I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
I'm well aware of your oath.
what happens to your name?
who carries the lion banner into future battles?
your nephews?
others whose names I don't even remember?
what happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
it survives through me.
I'll leave the Kingsguard.
I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
done.
when the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered,
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
he'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.
in three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall.
you'll remove your white cloak immediately.
you will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
you will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister.
and you'll never turn your back on your family again.
you have my word.
and you have mine.
not going well, is it?
you're going to be found guilty. - Oh, you think so?
when you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.
father's agreed to it.
he'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
how do you know?
do you trust me?
keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.
this will all be over soon.
the crown may call its next witness.
state your name.
do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
I swear it.
do you know this man?
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
how do you know him?
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
this man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
what do you know of this?
I know that he's guilty.
he and Sansa planned it together.
Silence!
continue.
she wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.
she blamed their deaths on the king.
Tyrion was happy to help.
he hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.
he hated you, my lord.
he stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
how could you possibly know all this?
why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
I wasn't just her maid.
I was his whore.
I beg your pardon?
you said you were his...
his whore.
how did you come to be in his service?
he stole me.
I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army.
but when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.
he broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
"you belong to me now," he said.
I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.
silence. Silence!
and did you?
did I what?
fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
I did everything he wanted.
whatever he told me to do to him.
whatever he felt like doing to me.
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.
I let him put himself where he wanted.
I was his property.
I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.
he ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did.
I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine.
please don't.
I am a whore.
remember?
that was before he married Sansa.
after that, all he wanted was her.
but she wouldn't let him into her bed.
so he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
father, I wish to confess.
I wish... to confess.
you wish to confess?
I saved you.
I saved this city and all your worthless lives.
I should have let Stannis kill you all.
do you wish to confess?
Yes, Father.
I'm guilty.
guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
you admit you poisoned the king?
no, of that I'm innocent.
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf.
you are not on trial for being a dwarf.
Oh, yes, I am.
I've been on trial for that my entire life.
have you nothing to say in your defense?
nothing but this
I did not do it.
I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1, 000 lying whores.
I wish I was the monster you think I am.
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.
escort the prisoner back to his cell.
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.
and I know I'll get no justice here.
so I will let the gods decide my fate.
I demand a trial by combat.
your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that
we've been here since midday.
easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found.
once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest
welcome to the Iron Bank.
please, sit.
what can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
this is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men,
lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
the Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon,
king of the Andals and the First Men,
lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
he shares no blood with me.
he is a bastard born of incest.
as was his brother before him.
Yes, we have heard this story.
it's not a story. It's the truth.
the king's grandfather tells a different story.
a story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
gold you loaned him.
and you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
more than any man living.
across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman
and "blood right.
here, our books are filled with numbers.
we prefer the stories they tell.
more plain.
less open to interpretation.
how many fighting men remain loyal to you?
4000
and how many ships do you have?
the ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
32
and how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4, 000 men on your 32 ships?
none.
you can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective.
I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request.
but we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
my lord.
I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.
you would not be either here.
in Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving.
that would be the pirates.
I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
this is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting.
he's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros.
which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.
the war is over.
as long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.
who's the real power in King's Landing?
ser Davos... - Humor me.
Tywin Lannister. - How old is Tywin Lannister?
67. - 67. And when he dies, who's in command?
a half-grown boy, the product of incest?
Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?
Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect?
when Tywin's gone, who do you back?
that is a problem for another time.
begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now.
there's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
he's got the birthright. He's in his prime.
he's a tried and tested battle commander.
and he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.
the lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
the captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt.
the first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
and when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory.
a few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!
the crew is shivering like scared mice.
but the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!
after the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?
the captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed.
the next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships!
we are surrounded!
the crew goes silent.
they all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command.
calm as ever, the captain bellows...
bring me my brown pants!
you think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
only half rotted.
join us, my friend. Join us.
this is Lhara.
and this is- - I am Lhara.
she's an artist, this one, truly.
no time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.
we?

now I know he despises me.
he wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold

and you won't be poor.
there's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
I gave it to your wife.
you're not my friend, my friend.
I'll see you at sunrise.
I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home.
on the first night of the full moon,
I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum
I found at Winterfell.

Yes! Yes!

No!

I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.
not Theon! Reek!
Reek! My name is Reek! - They're here.
if they catch us in here, we're trapped. - Help me with him.

you can't! - You're Theon Greyjoy.

I'm Reek!
loyal Reek!

but with those big balls of yours...
how fast can you run?
make for the ship, now. - But your brother.
my brother is dead.
I have a treat for you.
a reward.
reward?
Yes, Reek.
those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away.
and you didn't let them.
you remained loyal.
I- I didn't want them to take me.
I was so scared.
I didn't want them- - Yes, yes, Reek.
it's a bath.
for you.
remove those rags.
now.
the britches, too, Reek.
take them off.
do you love me, Reek?
Yes, of course, my lord.
good.
because I need you to do something for me.
something very important.
there's a castle, you see.
some bad men hold this castle.
I need your help to take this castle back.
but how can
I need you to play a role.
to pretend to be someone you're not.
pretend to be who?
you stand before Daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen, the first of her name, the unburnt queen of meereen queen of the andals and the first men, khaleesi of the great grass sea, breaker of chains and mother of dragons.

I thank him for his prayers.
it was your dragons, he says.
they came this morning for his flock.

my father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.

for that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honored to meet him.
you have, Your Grace.
you crucified him.
I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
your father crucified innocent children.
my father spoke out against crucifying those children.
he decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.
is it justice to answer one crime with another?
I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
you'd be wise to remember that.
what's done is done.
you are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
a servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
and what traditions do you speak of?
the tradition of funeral rite.
proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
my father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
and what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?
they were rotting in the sun as well.
would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.
I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.

the Targaryen girl?
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
she has conquered the city and rules as its queen.

she has a company of sellswords- the Second Sons.
she has two knights advising her
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
and she has three dragons. - Baby dragons.
larger every year, Your Grace.
Mormont is spying on her for us.

as for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
he's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.

dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
a child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
lord Varys is right.
I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
they are very impressive on the battlefield.
less so in the bedroom.
dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.
armies win them all the time.
she must be dealt with.
how, my lord?
by force? - Eventually, if it comes to that.
can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
most certainly, my Lord Hand.
Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
fetch my quill and paper.
prince Oberyn.
lord Varys...
only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman.
no one is under obligation to call me lord.
and yet everyone does.
you seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
did you spend much time in Essos?
five years.
may I ask why?
tis a big and beautiful world.
most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it.
I don't want to be most of us.
most of us aren't princes.
you are from Essos.
where? Lys?
I have an ear for accents.
I've lost my accent entirely. - I have an ear for that as well.
how did you get here? - It's a long story.
one you don't like telling people.
people I trust.
my paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
you should come to the brothel and meet her.
we brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.
we have some lovely boys on retainer, but...
you did like boys before?
Really?
girls? Hmm.
I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
not at all.
but I was never interested in girls, either.
what then? - Nothing.
everybody is interested in something.
not me.
when I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country,
I am very glad to have no part in it.
besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
such as?
let me guess, I've been pardoned.
Really?
father's orders.
well, we mustn't disappoint Father.
Kingslayer!
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon,
first of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King,
protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.
and with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
and if found guilty...
may the gods punish the accused.
you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
did you kill King Joffrey?
no.
did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
not that I know of.
how would you say he died, then?
choked on his pigeon pie.
so you would blame the bakers?
or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
the crown may call its first witness.
once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.
he slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
it wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate.
and when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.
Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
silence. - Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
Silence!
you will not speak unless called upon.
you're dismissed, Ser Meryn.
basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance...
blind eye
I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.
you have a lot of poison in your store.
had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.
by whom?
by the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse.
was it without question poison that killed him?
without question.
this was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.
he was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.
she wore this necklace the day of the wedding.
residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
it was. The Strangler.
a poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
and used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
I will hurt you for this.
a day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
your own brother said this to you?
shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
as it turned out, when the attack came,
Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.
he believed his presence would inspire the troops.
Tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid.
what debt?
I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.
I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs.
he wasn't pleased.
thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
I'm afraid I do, my lord.
he said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.
monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.
and he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
Yes.
after we received word of Robb Stark's death.
he didn't seem gladdened by the news.
perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
you're excused, Lord Varys.
father, may I ask the witness one question?
one.
you once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.
you said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget.
have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
sadly, my lord,
I never forget a thing.
we will adjourn for now.
toll the bells in an hour's time.
clear the court!
you'd condemn your own son to death?
I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
this isn't a trial. It's a farce.
Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
I know nothing of the sort.
you've always hated Tyrion. - He killed his king.
as did I.
do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?
to bring him your head.
I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
it won't be murder. It'll be justice. - Justice?
I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
if Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
he'll be executed. - No, he'll be punished accordingly.
once you said family is what lives on.
all that lives on.
you told me about a dynasty that would last 1, 000 years.
what happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?
I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
I'm well aware of your oath.
what happens to your name?
who carries the lion banner into future battles?
your nephews?
others whose names I don't even remember?
what happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
it survives through me.
I'll leave the Kingsguard.
I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
done.
when the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered,
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
he'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.
in three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall.
you'll remove your white cloak immediately.
you will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
you will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister.
and you'll never turn your back on your family again.
you have my word.
and you have mine.
not going well, is it?
you're going to be found guilty. - Oh, you think so?
when you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.
father's agreed to it.
he'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
how do you know?
do you trust me?
keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.
this will all be over soon.
the crown may call its next witness.
state your name.
do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
I swear it.
do you know this man?
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
how do you know him?
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
this man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
what do you know of this?
I know that he's guilty.
he and Sansa planned it together.
Silence!
continue.
she wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.
she blamed their deaths on the king.
Tyrion was happy to help.
he hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.
he hated you, my lord.
he stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
how could you possibly know all this?
why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
I wasn't just her maid.
I was his whore.
I beg your pardon?
you said you were his...
his whore.
how did you come to be in his service?
he stole me.
I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army.
but when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.
he broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
you belong to me now," he said.
I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world.
silence. Silence!
and did you?
did I what?
fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
I did everything he wanted.
whatever he told me to do to him.
whatever he felt like doing to me.
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.
I let him put himself where he wanted.
I was his property.
I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.
he ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did.
I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine.
please don't.
I am a whore.
remember?
that was before he married Sansa.
after that, all he wanted was her.
but she wouldn't let him into her bed.
so he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
father, I wish to confess.
I wish... to confess.
you wish to confess?
I saved you.
I saved this city and all your worthless lives.
I should have let Stannis kill you all.
do you wish to confess?
Yes, Father.
I'm guilty.
guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
you admit you poisoned the king?
no, of that I'm innocent.
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf.
you are not on trial for being a dwarf.
Oh, yes, I am.
I've been on trial for that my entire life.
have you nothing to say in your defense?
nothing but this
I did not do it.
I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1, 000 lying whores.
I wish I was the monster you think I am.
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.
escort the prisoner back to his cell.
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder.
and I know I'll get no justice here.
so I will let the gods decide my fate.
I demand a trial by combat.
I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
I'm sorry, what am I grateful for?
the opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?
you threw your life away. You threw it away.
it's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?
of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one.
I couldn't
I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies.
I couldn't do it.
you fell in love with a whore.
Yes, I fell in love with a whore.
and I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.
that deal you made, it was everything Father wanted.
you do see that? He gets you back as his heir.
the future Lord of the Rock.
and he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last.
all so perfect.
it felt good to take that from him.
he knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway.
he's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you.
you're the golden son.
you could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.
careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
at least I got to tell them what they really are.
Yes, brilliant speech.
they'll be talking about it for days to come.
I thought you were a realist.
didn't realize you'd die for pride.
don't give up on me just yet.
I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.
I can't save you this time either.
my training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
Where's your sense of adventure?
even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.
our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
it is tempting.
well...
Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again.
if he wins,
I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.
if he wins.
will you find him for me?
who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion?
I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant.
I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
no.
not Ser Meryn.
go on, move it.
and you.
come on.
mercy.
please. Please, mercy.
come ON
ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital.
thank you for riding here so quickly.
you seem to be in good form.
who am I fighting? Does it matter?
could be food. Could be soldiers.
you shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
where else to sit?
tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much.
then I remembered they burned my hut down. Who were "they"?
I stopped asking a while ago.
that's not gonna get better.
doesn't seem so. A bad way to go.
haven't you had enough? Of what?
I know.
time to go.
take matters into my own hands.
the thought has occurred to me.
so why go on?
habit.
nothing could be worse than this.
maybe nothing is worse than this.
nothing isn't better or worse than anything.
nothing is just nothing.
who are you?
my name is Arya.
you her father? Her captor.
bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
a fair exchange, that is.
always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings.
you give me, I give you.
fair.
a balance.
no balance anymore.
could I have a drink?
dying is thirsty work.
wish it were wine.
so do I.
that's where the heart is.
that's how you kill a man.
the fuck you doing?
there's a price on your head.
guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
the king's dead.
he drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.
the bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.
100 silver stags. And you thought you were going to collect it?
didn't think very hard, did you?
you were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.
he told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
this day's really not working out the way you planned.
he on your little list?
he can't be.
I don't know his name.
what's your name?
Rorge. - Thank you.
you're learning.
Rangers returning!
they return!
Rangers returning! - Greetings.
didn't think I'd see you again.
all right, Jon? Welcome back, brother.
lord Snow.
this is no place for wild beasts.
lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.
come on, Ghost.
Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left.
we saw their campfires from Osric's Hill.
they'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello.
the King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?
we need to prepare. We've been preparing.
we should seal the tunnel.
plug it with rocks and ice.
flood it and let it freeze. And how would we range north?
we wouldn't. - Coward.
you would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
we can't defend the gate against 100, 000 men.
this castle has stood for thousands of years.
the Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years.
and in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.
have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?
I have. Tunnel's gate won't stop them.
the bars on those gates are four inches thick.
cold-rolled steel. They won't stop them.
remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.
the stewards.
are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
no.
who would that be?
the builders. - Ah, the builders.
first Builder Yarwyck,
lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch.
do you agree with him?
no.
given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.
moving on.
first Builder, we'll need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.
Aye.
my lord.
you have new clothes.
do you like 'em? Eh?
gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
I sent for you days ago.
I've been a bit busy. - Doing what?
my lonesome bachelor days are over.
I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
she doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
she's dim-witted. If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.
when my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
aye, I did know about the older sister.
and you understand the rules of inheritance?
Falyse is 40 and barren.
she still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
she does. Unless she happens to perish before her father.
then Lollys gets the castle.
what? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
you and my sister deserve each other.
why did you bother to come here?
you once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.
is it two wives you want or two castles? One of each will do.
but if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle. I'm a bit short on castles at the moment.
but I can offer you gold and gratitude. I have gold.
what can I buy with gratitude? You might be surprised.
a Lannister always pays his debts.
your sister's a Lannister, too. My wife is heir to Winterfell.
if I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders,
I may one day rule the North in her name.
I could carve you out a big piece of it.
if and may and could. It's bloody cold up north.
Lollys is soft and warm.
and close.
if I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.
does he frighten you so much? I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me.
he's freakish big and freakish strong.
and quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size.
maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow.
but one misstep and I'm dead.
why should I risk it?
because you're my friend.
aye, I'm your friend.
and when have you ever risked your life for me?
I like you, pampered little shit that you are.
I just like myself more.
I understand. I'm sorry it has to be this way.
why are you sorry?
because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart?
that's what I liked about you in the first place.
we had some good days together. Yes, we did.
what will you do?
I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself.
won't that make for a great song?
I hope to hear them sing it one day.
how did you get in here?
your door is well guarded, but your window is not.
I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
don't do that again.
never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.
these are my private quarters.
if I want you here, I will summon you.
forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.
tell me why you're here.
I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world
war and women.
you are staying here in Meereen to rule.
that is a wise decision. I respect it.
but here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.
I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
you've ordered us to be night watchmen. - And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.
there is only one, and she does not want me.
you swore me your sword.
my sword is yours till the day I die.
so if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.
send me to kill your enemies.
any enemy anywhere.
let me do what I do best.
very well.
do what you do best.
take off your clothes.
come in, my queen. Please.
I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady. You could never disturb me.
I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
could you bring me that vial over there?
the blue one.
no, no, no. Not that one.
you don't even want to touch that one.
next to it.
that's the one.
when I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me.
he said, "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while.
make it count.
a joke.
not a very good one, I'm afraid.
it was. I
humor isn't my strength.
that's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
if they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?
not always.
most of these powders and potions are lies.
deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power.
once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was
a trick that lead them to the truth.
a pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.
and this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.
and a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.
did you use it with Stannis? No.
don't be upset.
men never crave what they already have.
it's only flesh.
it needs what it needs.
no act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin.
I thank God every day for bringing you to us.
and Stannis to you.
he wants to bring Shireen with us.
I think that would be ill-advised.
my daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware.
I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.
I understand how you feel.
but that is impossible.
Why?
you don't need powders and potions, my queen.
you don't need lies.
you are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself.
however harsh it is.
however hard for us to understand.
you don't need my help, but I will need yours soon.
when we set sail, your daughter must be with us.
the Lord needs her.
Jorah the Andal.
are you here to see our queen?
she's in a good mood.
Khaleesi.
you're here early. - Later than some.
you don't approve?
it's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.
you neither approve nor trust.
why would I? The man's a sellsword.
didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
I did. I trust you.
Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.
how could you ever have faith in a man like that?
I could never have faith in a man like Daario.
that's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
you have? - I have.
without you there to rule, Khaleesi,
I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.
that is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.
the masters tear babies from their mothers' arms.
they mutilate little boys by the thousands.
they train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.
they treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.
herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts.
the slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known.
if you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.
and repay the slavers with what? Kindness?
a fine? A stern warning?
it's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
let the priests argue over good and evil.
slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it.
and I will end those behind it.
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.
and now you are helping me show them to freedom.
I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
the man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
he will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.
he will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.
he will explain the choice they have before them.
they can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.
Yes, Khaleesi.
no.
tell him you changed my mind.
rat cunts.
fucking whore.
you're doing it wrong.
you need to burn away that horrible bit there.
otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester.
I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right
no fire.
it'll only take a second.
it won't hurt that much. - No fire!
shut up about it.
shut up about everything.
thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.
which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.
I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.
no reward is worth this much trouble.
wish I'd never laid eyes on you.
you say your brother gave you that sword.
my brother gave me this.
it was just like you said a while back.
pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
Why? Thought I stole one of his toys.
I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it.
the pain was bad. The smell was worse.
but the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.
my father, who protected him...
told everyone my bedding caught fire.
you think you're on your own?
let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
bit of comfort never hurt anyone.
we've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.
I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
couldn't agree more, my lady. Just don't start expecting silk underclothes.
not working for your former lord any longer.
Yes, my lady. - Don't get drunk.
no, my lady.
can I get you anything else? No, this will do nicely, thank you.
kidney pie is wonderful. Thanks.
I do my best.
a good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.
flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.
easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy.
I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.
got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.
don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right.
see, a lot of people give up on the gravy.
you cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie.
simple as that.
that's nice armor. Are you a knight?
no.
Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights.
generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you?
from there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred.
what brings you to these parts?
we're looking for someone.
someone in particular? Maybe they came in here.
a lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17
a girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.
her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.
Starks?
what, like them lot from "Winterhell"?
no, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors.
don't need no traitors in here.
I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.
I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?
what? It's nothing, my lady.
you wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.
you're not interesting enough to be offensive.
the Lannisters want Lady Sansa.
the Lannisters have money.
people kill for money.
I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
my lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
what about? Not kidney pie.
you seem like a proper lady.
someone who could be trusted.
I never met no Sansa Stark.
but I know her sister...
no one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.
she's presumed dead.
she weren't when I last spoke to her.
when was that? - Heading up north with the Night's Watch.
she was all dressed up as a boy.
like your ladyship, only without the armor.
going by the name Arry.
so what happened to her? - Well
the quick version.
the Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped.
the Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep.
they were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.
big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham.
not friendly. - The Hound.
that's the one.
if you find her, could you give her this?
she liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.
um, you were saying?
her mother's dead, grandfather's dead,
Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.
the Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun. They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.
why the Eyrie? Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.
Catelyn Stark's sister.
she's Arya's last living relative with money.
she hates the Lannisters.
lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.
Sansa could be there, too.
aye, my lady.
could be.
you sure about this?
no.
I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
mm, do tell.
I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.
your sister.
Cersei approached me.
we spoke a great deal about her daughter.
how worried your sister is about her.
she was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you.
I think she may have even believed it herself.
making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
it was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.
it is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.
she desperately wants to see you killed.
she didn't need to bother you.
it looks as though I've taken care of that myself.
the joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck.
she's wanted this for a long time.
Yes, I know.
we met, you and I.
many years ago.
I THINK I would have remembered that.
unlikely. You had just been born.
our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.
my first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock.
not the food, not the weather, not your accents.
nothing.
but the biggest disappointment...
you.
you and my family have more in common than you might admit.
the whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister.
a head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.
that would have made things so much easier.
when we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us.
every day we would ask. Every day she would say, "Soon."
then she and your brother took us to your nursery and...
she unveiled the freak.
your head was a bit large.
your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw.
no red eye. No tail between your legs.
just a tiny pink cock.
we didn't try to hide our disappointment.
"that's not a monster," I told Cersei.
that's just a baby.
and she said, "He killed my mother."
and she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off.
until your brother made her stop.
"it doesn't matter," she told us.
everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right.
he should not have lived this long.
well...
sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.
and what about what I want?
justice for my sister and her children.
if you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.
I disagree.
I've come to the perfect place.
I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.
and all those who have wronged me are right here.
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too.
I will be your champion.
Hello, Robin.
what are you doing? I'm building my home, Winterfell.
at least I think I am.
I haven't been back there in a very long time.
why did you leave?
it's a long story.
I stay here in the Eyrie.
mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
Yes, you certainly are.
when will you go back?
probably never.
my family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
does Winterfell have a Moon Door? No, I'm afraid not.
it's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.
that sounds dangerous.
how do you make people fly? - We don't.
what do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
well, I'm Lord of the Vale.
when I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.
or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh!
right through the Moon Door.
I like the sound of that. Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
all right. It can go in here in this big tower.
be Careful. You've ruined it.
now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
I didn't ruin it. - You did.
it was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door.
I was fixing it. Knocking things down isn't fixing them.
it's ruining them. - I didn't ruin it!
you're being stupid. - I didn't ruin it!
Robin, I'm sorry, I
children.
I hit him. - Yes, I saw.
I shouldn't have done that.
no, his mother should have a long time ago.
consider it a step in the right direction.
if he tells Aunt Lysa... Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
I was trying to remember what everything looked like.
I'll never see it again.
a lot can happen between now and never.
if you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.
why did you really kill Joffrey?
tell me why.
I loved your mother more than you could ever know.
given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love?
in a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child.
but we don't live in that world.
you're more beautiful than she ever was.
lord Baelish... Call me Petyr.
you wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?
come here, Sansa.
do you know how far the fall is?
no.
neither do I, precisely.
hundreds of feet.
it's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height.
the impact breaks them right apart.
like eggs dropped on the floor.
sometimes pieces remain intact.
you'll find the head sitting on its own.
every hair in place.
blue eyes staring at nothing.
I know what you did.
I-I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa.
I never should have hit Robin, I know it.
I promise it won't happen-- - Don't be coy with me, you little whore.
you kissed him. You kissed Petyr.
I didn't. You don't understand. - I saw you.
you can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
he kissed me. I pulled away. - Liar!
whore! He is mine!
my father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead.
that's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me.
look down!
look down! Look down! Look down!
let her go.
you want her?
this empty-headed child?
let her go.
she's just like her mother. She'll never love you.
I lied for you.
I killed for you.
why did you bring her here? Why?
I'll send her away.
I swear on my life.
I swear to all the gods.
let her go, Lysa.
Oh, my sweet wife.
my sweet, silly wife.
I have only loved one woman...
only one, my entire life.
your sister.
the MAN I LOVE
what are you two up to?
cut it out now!
give me that. Whose keys are they?
they're mine. - Hand them over.
what's your name? - Najib.
these are Lucas'. Where did you get them?
hurry up and shower. We close in 15 minutes.
Martin, are you happy here?
our lifeguard. You haven't met him. He's off duty today.
close up the pool...
you're the new monitor?
I'm Lucas.
Martin.
you seem to have scored.
with them? Whatever...
I'll be closing in 15 minutes.
not today. I'm diving.
but I'm finished.
and I'm just starting.
find something to do.
clean the lockers. The toilets are filthy.
sorry, I'm not waiting an hour.
hey hunk, I said...
it's closing time!
happy now? How will I get home?
take this.
forget it. I'll manage.
take it. I meant to give it to you. It's too big for me.
look... I bet you look good in stripes.
my cologne... I hope you'll like it.
Lucas, wait up!
you walk fast!
who asked you to follow me?
still angry?
no, I don't care. It'll dry.
where are you going? - St. Victor.
can I tag along?
you always walk with your head down.
so did I, when I was a kid. One day...
I banged into a wall. It was pretty serious.
been working there long?
2 or 3 years.
a wedding ring! Married?
it's my mother's. She's dead.
sorry...
I was 6 months old. I got over it.
you live alone or with someone?
no? Yes?
girls must like you. - That depends.
are you seeing a girl or not?
you ask too many questions.
I don't know why. I'm usually shy.
now we're both dead silent.
can I ask you one last question?
answer... - What is it?
are you gay?
I asked if you're gay. I am, that's why.
it's easier when everything's out in the open.
so?
I like you, Lucas.
really... not just a little.
can I invite you out?
what the hell? Are you stupid? You're sick!
bingo.
why are you here?
I found these at the pool.
you used the chimney?
the neighbor's.
never put your address on your keys.
I don't care.
can I have some water?
running up stairs is bad for me.
I'll drink and scram. How about it?
you're into sign language?
deaf friends? - The kitchen's there.
I know sign language too.
isn't that funny?
we can talk in signs. It's easier for communicating.
weren't you thirsty?
if we work together, we might as well get along. Forget what I said.
that's hard.
sorry, I'm not deaf.
I misunderstood... I saw you signing.
working with the deaf gets to me.
Lise.
Martin. I'm a friend of Lucas'.
you have a friend? Good!
we're not friends. We work together.
Yeah, we're... office mates.
"friend" is a figure of speech.
exactly... So long now.
I don't get it. How do you know sign language?
it's a long story.
don't just stand there. Come tell me...
I have lots of deaf friends.
and my best friend's boyfriend is deaf.
but that's not the real reason.
go on...
the first guy I fell in love with was deaf.
I didn't know how to approach him. I learned to sign.
it can help. - Not at all.
it was a flop.
I wasn't his type.
and you?
did you learn it out of love?
sort of...
generally speaking. I work with deaf kids. I interpret.
stop it, Lucas!
where did you get this? - It's his.
we swapped. There was a flood at the pool.
I always said you look good in stripes.
what now?
see you later. We're busy.
so long...
wait... Are you free for dinner?
I'd planned something romantic...
but that flopped too.
don't stay by yourself.
come eat with us.
I reserved for two.
good thinking.
so long...
what's your problem?
wait, I'm wearing heels!
if you love me, beware!
beware!
what are you having?
try the fish soup. It's not canned.
you keep on brooding.
can't we talk?
you never talk?
not much.
what do you like?
music?
books? Cars?
none of that.
soccer! Let's talk soccer. I love it.
Oh yeah, I ask too many questions.
why did you come?
eating alone ruins my appetite.
and it's best that I don't diet.
don't worry. I won't ruin your night out.
no more tables. - Forget it. I'll go.
out of the question. We'll squeeze.
come on...
I'll sit between you two.
good idea.
really. We'll bother each other less.
what are you having?
fish soup.
stop, I'm dizzy!
have you known Lucas for long?
a year, but it seems like forever.
you're lucky...
I mean, you both are.
thanks for the flowers.
there's one for each of you.
you didn't say a word all night.
nothing to say.
I like your Martin.
he's not my Martin!
I could get jealous. He likes you.
cut the crap!
I bet guys like you.
too bad for them.
too bad for him.
where are you going?
you deserve a prize.
are you crazy?
you're showing off, you dive, you deserve this.
idiot!
stop it! What's going on?
sorry, Mr. Millau.
clean that up now!
you understand?
I'm going about it wrong.
I'll say.
life sucks. Pools are full of guys like you.
I chose the wrong one.
Yeah, what a bummer.
you're not too angry?
why would I be?
Cheers.
where were you?
I had to work late.
I'm celebrating my birthday.
same day, year after year. Call me dumb, but I like birthdays.
Lucas, why did you forget?
who are you kidding? - I had to work late.
don't ever do it again.
now you say "Happy Birthday."
and now you kiss me.
let go of the pole, Mrs. Raspail.
move your legs, your arms... Very good.
take a breath. Watch your rhythm.
I'm fed up. Since you work together, it's non-stop trouble.
you could have killed her!
she's coming to her Thursday class.
that's not the point!
as for you, next time, you're fired.
you too. - Lay off him!
I said "Lay off him." I'll be going.
I'm the troublemaker, so I'll go find another job.
no one's stopping you.
no, wait.
it's not worth it.
it's my fault. It won't happen again.
beat it...
you better toe the line. I'm watching you.
were you serious? You were ready to leave?
you'd have missed me?
it'd have been a shame.
you'd have missed me. - Shut up.
it'd have been stupid to leave.
pain in the ass.
I didn't know you had a fan club.
me neither.
a souvenir of your belly dive.
you were lucky.
Thanks, Dad.
get going now. I need the bed.
I have a long waiting list.
call me. We'll have dinner.
whatever...
still with that girl?
lise? More or less.
are things okay? - More or less.
and between you and your wife?
more or less.
it's you! You were supposed to come see me six months ago!
I'm cured. You should be happy.
don't fool around with that. Take an appointment.
no way. Your treatments were killing me.
that's nonsense. - Get real.
they don't work on me.
there are other drugs available.
I can't get them right away.
no use waiting until I'm dead.
I'll make my own antivirals all by myself.
and I'll do it better than you, doc.
I have a new boyfriend.
he's Mr. Right. It's no time for weakness.
I expected to see a cadaver.
aren't you going overboard?
so long. I'm going.
what about my flowers?
what are you doing?
get lost!
stop it!
get lost!
put everything back and I'll let you go.
I do what I want, asshole.
good heavens! My husband!
tough luck.
cut the crap.
sit down.
come on, I won't rape you.
see? We get along.
what do you think of me?
don't start.
have you ever looked at a guy?
I see guys all day. - I know. Naked ones.
but you don't look at them. You're scared to get a hard-on.
bullshit!
I love you, Lucas.
stop it, please.
I can't.
go home.
how are you two?
fine.
I'll leave him to you.
am I bothering you?
it's been two hours. Come out.
talk to me. Tell me what's wrong.
put your arms around me.
caress me.
put your mouth here.
stop.
that's enough. - No, it isn't.
stop, I said!
why don't you want me?
it's not the first time.
if you don't desire me, something happened.
did you meet someone?
what's going on?
it's Martin.
what does he have to do with it?
I answered your question.
did something happen? Did he...
no, he didn't. He didn't do a thing.
why am I telling you this? I'm just tired.
I'm glad you came.
we haven't eaten together in ages.
what nerve! You're never free!
how about "Chez Vincent"? - Perfect.
are you okay? - Fine.
are things okay with Lise?
are you sure?
why do you ask?
we're not too close. We don't talk much.
I don't know about your life.
I didn't know you prefer men.
your relationship with Martin is between you two.
how do you know Martin?
I was his doctor. Did he tell you?
about what?
he's up to his ears in AIDS.
Kaposi, toxoplasmosis... he had it all.
are you careful?
don't worry.
I'm fine.
let's eat, but don't bring this up, okay?
okay.
no, Mathieu. I won't go back to the hospital.
when did you do your last tests?
I'd prefer to see a fortune teller.
being in a hospital bed is like trying out a coffin.
I'm not big on hospitals either.
now they search me at the door.
they're scared I'll chain myself to the director.
not that he doesn't deserve it.
don't you get tired of annoying people?
we could be nice and discreet. Respectable sick people.
like in the slaughterhouse.
they toll the bells of Saint Faggy.
keep your bells.
I deserve the Military Cross.
but they give it to survivors.
you heard about Fabrice?
Yeah, I did.
see this?
it was my phone book. Now it's an obituary.
why are you here? - To talk to you.
I know you're sick.
so? Does that bother you?
if you need me, I'm here. - If I need what?
a nurse?
what are you doing here?
you want to do a good deed? Buy a red ribbon.
but don't wipe my ass with it. Not you.
that's not why I came.
why then?
out of pity?
no, not out of pity.
Why?
you're right. I shouldn't have come.
look at me, Lucas.
I'm not dead yet.
the day I die, I'll let you know, okay?
okay.
stick by your phone. You never know when...
wait.
do you like Pavese?
Pavese, the poet. Do you like him?
I don't know him.
it figures.
it's late. - Is it?
I dilly-dallied.
what are you reading? - Pavese.
what's it about?
lots of stuff.
they were in front of the door. Weird, isn't it?
they got the floor wrong.
who?
the book deliverers.
the book deliverers. They exist.
they even underlined a passage.
who?
the deliverers.
cut it out you fairies!
is it his menopause? - Exactly.
Pablo, what do you care about music?
that's true. I'm sorry.
better now?
just great. My Kaposi is in great shape!
enough! Don't make a big deal over 3 lousy T4's.
how many do you have?
a millionaire! Place your bets! And you?
I have 3. I win. At zero, I get a trophy.
take your pills with water.
it's better this way.
at the rate I'm going, pop corn would be as useful.
can I ask you a favor?
shoot.
when this shit is over, when I'm a rotting cadaver, do something for me.
cut off my head and send it to the President.
let me spoil his lunch.
you're such a pain, I'll love cutting you up.
you're the best.
how's it going with Lucas? - Fine.
we've become soul sisters.
he reads to me... knits.
he's great.
perfect.
marvelous.
my dream come true.
tonight... he'll share my bed.
place your bets.
why are you calling? Are you dead?
no, I'm fast asleep.
who is it?
let me talk to him. - Forget it.
what did he want?
I don't know. And I don't care.
come in.
what's wrong? - I can't sleep.
why wake me? - I can't sleep alone.
why me? - I want to sleep with you.
you wanted to help me, so stay.
talk to me. Put on some music.
at 3 a. m?
there's no controlling desire.
let me die alone if you want. It's your choice.
why did I call? I shouldn't have.
it's unbearable. I like you too much.
go back to bed with Lise.
but understand I wish I were her.
promise you won't touch me.
of course I promise.
you'll do the touching.
come on. Put your hands here and your head behind mine.
I don't believe it. You're a real virgin!
give it a try. It's harder for me.
caressing isn't forbidden.
stop!
I'm the sick one. I'm entitled to caresses.
how about a blow job too?
I'd rather wait.
you can't hurry love.
that day, you will know.
that day, we too will know "that you are life "and that you are nothingness.
death will come. It will have your eyes.
I'm glad you read it.
coffee? I just made some.
I'm Rose.
Martin's mother.
have a seat.
sugar?
do you live with him?
then we're friends too.
it must be serious. It's good it's happening now.
you're handsome.
why do you say that? - I'm happy for Martin.
he deserves it.
he mentioned his disease?
so you use protection when...
I mean...
how silly of me. Martin's always careful.
he's very serious.
be honest with me: do you love him?
of course he loves me!
right, honey?
don't be embarrassed. Mom understands.
what's there to understand? - Exactly. Nothing.
you like men, you sleep with Martin. It's normal.
what'll she think?
that we sleep together. She's cool.
and me?
just like me, asshole.
look at me. No lipstick, no feathers up my ass. I'm like you.
that's not what I meant. - What then?
surprise!
juventus.
inter.
Barcelona.
it's chic for Sundays.
I'll give you one too.
what's your favorite team?
I don't know.
my dad was a soccer coach. When he learned I liked boys, he was so ashamed, he wouldn't let me kiss him.
the field became off-limits.
martin started collecting every team's outfits.
so that ass would be less ashamed.
you were ashamed too.
are you kidding?
at first I was a little... - Crushed.
suicidal.
then Mom pulled herself together, buying me jerseys to sleep in!
solidarity! My husband was an asshole.
I got fed up and kicked him out.
today... I'll take you out for a ride.
move your ass!
Lucas, wait...
brazil, that's it!
you like Brazil?
yellow and green go with his eyes.
take a deep breath like me.
it may be one of my last.
what? You don't like my ride?
no, it's in bad taste.
but you might as well go all the way.
no, actually, I don't like it here.
what are you up to?
I'm going round the property.
choosing my next home. Aren't I allowed?
I'm such a perfectionist.
you don't need us here.
I'm doing it for you!
won't it be nicer visiting me in a pretty cemetery?
don't sandwich me between a highway and a factory.
don't ruin my day! I'm dying and you're brooding?
let's go. It's too sad here.
full of couples and families. Fucking cemetery!
I don't like this one either.
I have one left to see. Shall we?
enough!
Hey, Rose!
what are you after? Aren't I unhappy enough?
what else? Screw your cemetery!
I won't let you go! For once, you'll obey your mother.
obey, or I'll slap you in front of your friend.
I don't deserve that.
I don't belong in a cemetery.
I'm not Jewish, Catholic or Muslim, none of the above.
there's one place where I want to be buried.
here.
and especially here.
I'm glad Martin's with you.
you're good. And he seems happy.
he hasn't always been.
I try my best.
can we speak frankly?
I hope you're not playing with him.
if you're not sure of yourself, go away.
I'm not playing.
you better not be.
if you hurt him, I'll kill you.
I'll blast your brains out.
I have to take it out on someone, right?
do I seem dumb?
what now?
nothing. It's great picnic weather.
how are you two? Have a nice day?
how about your night? How was that?
I hear guys suck best.
nothing happened.
come on...
you go off in the night, don't call all day... What happened?
we were with his mother.
mother-in-law came along?
Hello, ma'am.
you're not funny. - You think it's easy?
stay there!
you can't have Lucas.
he's mine.
understand?
he loves me, lives with me, makes love to me.
I don't ask that much.
you're pissing me off! This concerns me!
can't I decide?
go on, decide for once.
martin needs me.
and I don't? - It's different.
sure it is.
stop, Lucas.
he's sick.
you understand now?
I see.
come on, Martin. Let's go.
what can I say now?
you understand? - You don't.
if he weren't sick, would things be different?
you'd still have slept at his place.
it's high.
no, the void is in your head.
come closer.
imagine touching the water.
can you feel it?
a rubber ring, please.
can't you help him? He has to pull through.
martin can't be treated. It's too late.
do your goddamn job!
how?
with what?
tell the Minister or the drug companies.
they claim everyone's cured. They love selling treatments.
they come out with a new one each month.
they live well. But too bad...
too bad, because my patients keep on dying.
as for my job, I try to do it... with the means I'm given.
so? When will you get moving?
once everyone's dead?
at last, a pretty nurse!
tell me the truth, doctor.
I'm doomed, aren't I?
you've still got time.
a beautiful thing like me... how tragic!
let's go.
we can't welcome the new year here.
it's too depressing.
and there's no confetti.
what are you doing?
changing hotels, ma'am.
I wanted a room overlooking the sea.
you're staying put.
relax... I'm of peasant stock.
we like dying at the farm.
and you're not my type.
I prefer the bellhop.
cut it out.
put it all on my bill.
can I lean against you?
I used to swim here as a kid, with my mother.
I came every year until I was 16 or 17.
then I had enough.
I went to Italy. I traveled around.
it's dumb. I had it all here.
all the discos, all the beds I saw.
then you show up. I could have killed you.
couldn't you have come earlier?
you don't care? You pull away from me?
you're not like me?
that's not true.
can I kiss you?
don't look so glum. Just one kiss.
relax, it's not contagious.
come on, it's just a kiss.
okay.
but not a long one.
no tongue. - Of course not.
I'm not an easy lay.
promise? - On my T4's.
you promised!
sorry. I have no more T4's!
very funny.
you're a good kisser.
hot Lips!
hot Lips!
come back!
Millau sent me a get well card.
I'm fired.
what a bastard.
I couldn't have stayed long anyway.
I'd have preferred it to end differently.
I'll have to move. I can't afford this place.
where will you go? - You know a hotel?
how will you live?
that's not for me. I'm being ushered out.
that way, Martin. Be a good faggot and die.
just stay here.
will I pay the rent with my body? Too risky!
I wasn't fired. - You can't pay it for me.
I don't know... I can move in here.
no, there's no reason to.
I know one.
it's not a good idea.
Why? It's not what you want?
I'm sorry. I'm suddenly scared of what will happen.
what are you scared of?
I don't know.
that I can't give you what you want, not having the time or the desire.
I want you...
you don't know what that means...
Yes, I do.
be careful.
I love you.
like I've never loved before.
Lise, I'm leaving...
go on.
I left my number - Martin's - just in case...
in case of what?
if you want to call me.
for a nice friendly dinner?
who the hell are you kidding?
I'll come back for the rest of my stuff.
Pavese.
Max is fragile.
you as a kid.
can I kiss you one last time?
no, I'll use sign language.
you're crazy!
get lost.
go, now.
go now...
second thoughts?
not yet.
I can't sleep.
I have to get used to this.
where are you going?
out for a drink. So you can sleep.
I'll come along.
if you want to.
welcome to the club. - Leave me alone.
you asked to come.
I expected a normal bar.
this is a normal bar, honey.
what's wrong?
you seem upset.
let me guess.
you want a pinball machine.
exactly.
I'll show you around.
Frederic, Pascal, Pablo, meet Lucas.
what was that?
that we're almost married with kids.
what did they say?
we make a nice couple.
you look good. - Just back from Club Med.
this is Lucas.
no kid brother? - He's one of a kind.
what am I doing here?
we're all the same. But some are gayer than others.
Lucas, come here.
what is it?
your girlfriend's in the hospital.
shit! Lise!
the emergency room. Take the day off.
silence = DEATH AT WAR WITH AIDS.
you called Millau?
sure. You have other girlfriends?
lie down. We need you here.
what is this?
it's no game.
we're angry.
angry because eating makes us sicker, because we're denied certain treatments, because there's never enough money, because we're dying and they're screwing us over!
Hi, doc.
you know Martin.
whose side are you on?
he's my father.
my daddy-in-law! Who'd have guessed?
go home. Don't get involved.
get rid of them.
this is a hospital.
Act-up fights back, AIDs is war!
I think your father is against our marriage.
what are you doing?
it's February 10th.
so?
it's Jerome's birthday.
who's Jerome?
we lived together for 4 or 5 years.
I can't remember.
I can't keep track of the years.
five years.
we broke up for a year.
I went to Italy for a change of scenery.
I didn't know we were HIV-positive.
Mathieu picked me up at the station.
without a word, he took me to the hospital.
I waited for you up to the end...
I looked at him in bed. I caressed him.
I thought: he's not Jerome.
but it was him.
in my arms, he was as light as a child.
I was afraid to hurt him.
it'll happen to me, Lucas.
I'll become like Jerome.
maybe you won't stay to the end.
I have no right to ask you to.
if you want to go, I won't stop you.
I won't leave you. I never will.
turn it off.
I want to caress you.
stop!
it's just my allergy.
your allergy. To what?
to bastards, air, pollution. No need to panic.
you've lost weight. Did you see a doctor?
of course. - Who?
a friend of Mathieu's at the hospital.
you never go to the hospital. When was the last time?
you're not my mother. I've been in hospitals for 10 years.
I've stopped believing in miracles.
you're my only miracle.
it's true, honey.
did you see my present?
Papin! - You don't have it?
you have to. - You take them. I'm full.
I can get up alone. I'm a big boy.
let's go to bed.
leave me alone. Martin's dead.
Martin's still alive. Still moving, breathing.
can't you feel it?
he vibrates... he gets hard...
I'll keep him alive for years to come.
get going. Go home.
I am home.
home is with Lise, with your father, but not here.
I love you. I want to stay with you.
that's bullshit. Get lost now.
I'm staying.
you piss me off. What do you love? This piece of shit?
the poor sick boy? Late Martin?
I love you. Martin.
beat it!
besides, you're a lousy fuck.
if you want to be alone tonight, tell me and I'll go.
but don't be mean.
I want to be alone.
fine.
see you tomorrow.
Yeah, right. Tomorrow.
open up!
I looked everywhere. No one knows.
his mother, his friends...
I have to find him. He's sick.
it's late. You haven't slept in days.
you won't find him at 4 a. m.
this suits you fine.
you're happy.
no, I'm not.
if he dies, everything will be like before.
I'm here, I'm listening. You want me to go looking?
don't ask too much.
you won't come upstairs?
star lost in the light of dawn, creaking wind, warmth and breath, the night is over. You are light and morning.
the doctor came by this morning.
I know. I pretended to be asleep.
I heard you talking about me.
he told you that the final countdown had begun.
is that true?
do we count in days or months?
it can go very quickly.
that's just like me.
at school, during track, I took off before the others.
I'd win, but I cheated.
this time, I didn't even get to cheat.
look.
I'm shaking.
are you cold?
I'm scared.
he's here.
thank your father. He found him.
wrong.
I'd prefer Waddle.
it doesn't matter. I'll take you anyway.
we'll try here. - They'll say the same thing.
I have a hunch.
Hello, Father.
we need your church.
but the chapel is closed.
that's just perfect.
my son Martin and his friend Lucas.
now that you've met, we can start.
start what?
the marriage.
what marriage?
Mr. Lucas Gallian, do you take as husband.
...as husband, Mr. Martin Barbieri?
I do.
Mr. Martin Barbieri, do you take as husband Mr. Lucas Gallian?
you are now married in the name of the Holy Trinity.
do that outside, please.
you're an angel.
now we can adopt a little Peruvian or an Argentinean.
I don't want kids right away.
you're too young to be a grandma.
you're right. We have years.
it's nothing, Lucas. I'm just happy.
all in all, I don't mind dying.
they'll ask me:
"tell us about your holiday on Earth.
what was the best part?" I'll answer:
the sea, the sun, the sky, the cities.
there's plenty to like.
but as for that beach boy...
keep me posted on him.
touch me here.
just touch me lightly.
a caress can be so nice.
call me "my love."
call me "my love." Say: "My love."
you'll love me forever?
you won't forget me?
never. I swear.
there once was, indeed, carefree young generation in Russia which summers smiled and sun and sea and chose Pepsi.
in those distant days kids were supposed to strive to shiny firefighter's casket or white doctor's robe.
but we, lying by the sea in summer, stared at cloudless blue horizon, drank warm Pepsi-cola from glass bottles filled in Novorosiyska and dreamt that someday distant and forbidden world from that side of the sea will come into our lives.
I fell into Generation P by default.
my name, Vavilen, was made up from words Vasily Aksyonov and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.
in some sense I justified my name. I enrolled Institute of Literature, wrote verses and held course to eternity pretending as if nothing happened around me.
as soon as eternity dissolved, I found myself in actuality. I had no connections, so I settled in as vendor in kiosk.
job was simple, yet nervous.
in evenings I paid money to Hussein, chechen who always had butter-yellowish eyes due to opiate abuse.
working in kiosk, I mastered two new skills. First was cynicism, endless like view from Onstankino tower.
hello. Any complaints? No.
lack of complaints does not free from responsibility.
second skill was astounding and hard to explain. Be so kind, one cigarette...
it was enough to take a brief glance at clients hands to comprehend whether I can swindle him and on how much precisely.
hand the money.
forty six [thousand].
life is a lonely journey, under scorching sun and chilling cold.
how often the road we are going leads us nowhere! And it is unknown when death will meet us.
when you think about it, everything in the world seems empty and small.
then enlightenment kicks in: "Tuborg - be prepared for anything.
pack of Davidov. Normal or light?
normal.
listen, have you got condoms? But good ones, not tampered with.

hundred forty five.
all the best on dick!
Vava?
is that you? Markovin?
take the key, I'm leaving.
Vova, it is special time now. It hasn't been anytime before and it won't be anytime in future.
frenzy. Like in Klondike.
yea, two more years and everything will be snatched, but today there is still real possibility to get into this system. Understand?
so, you've gotten into it. Process is in progress. Get in.
the only place where there is real dough is commercials.
this is roughly how it happens...
a man takes credit, on this credit he opens an office, buys Cherokee SUV and eight boxes of Smirnoff vodka.
when vodka is consumed, it turns out that SUV is smashed, office is puked full, but credit must be returned.
if the bank to which man is in debt belongs to bandits, in some moment man is killed.
I didn't catch what relation has all this with commercials?
well. The most impotant thing.
when half of Smirnoff vodka is not consumed yet, some chemical reaction takes place in man's head.
he feels unrestricted power. And he wants to make commercial clip for himself.
this is the place where we come out of bushes.
there are some studios making commercial clips. They need shrewd script writes like bread to eat.
Oh, Vavilen Tatarskiy! Hello. This is Lena.
is Tatarsky a surname or nickname? It is a surname.
this is Segey. Let's cut to the chase.
Vavilen...
story goes as follows...
object is about fifty years old, he used to teach physics.
when all this havoc just began, he organized cooperative in producing cakes "bird's milk."
and in two years time he got so much dough, that now he rents half of Babayevski factory.
and recently he took...credit. Very big credit.
the day before yesterday he began boozing.
where do you have such evidence from? Secretary is a friend of mine.
well then, he must be taken right away. Because when he's sober he is very tightfisted.
Hi.
a jacket.
put this thing on your belt. You have meeting with client at one o'clock. At one twenty I will call you on this bleeper.
when it bleeps, you get it, look at it with importance. Understood?
while client talks, make notes in this notebook.
Rolex. When you talk with the client, flash it.
careful, don't scratch the plating.
you have got a wonderful factory. Shall we get to business?
what corporative positions are we gonna strenghten?
well...I don't know. We have imported stands with fluoride...
isn't that from Video International?
no, those shitheads don't call me anymore, thanks to God. Slava Zaitsev. Today's meeting is off.
does he think we need this meeting more than he does? Let's talk about it later.
excuse me...
aren't you afraid that one fine day all this...
could end?
you know what times we live in. What if everything collapses?
I am afraid. But who doesn't?
you crazy or what? We will get shit asking such questions. It will be fine. Now I know what he needs.
folk comes and folk goes, but land stays. Mediis tempustatibus placidus - calm among the storms.
Lefortovski confectionary enterprise
that is how I became copywriter. I did not explain anything to my previous authorities.
I hope Hussein did get the keys from kiosk. People talked chechens asked big money for quitting the business.
Yes, Andrey Ivanich, we are working. Creative work.
our [people] are all ears and have discount at Rakushki garages.
I did not earn particulary much money, but it still was more than in field of vending.
tonight on Vernatski prospect Zhilin, director of Lefortovski confectionary enterprise, was killed. His SUV Grand Cherokee was fired at from passing car.
investigation suggests Zhilin's murder was connected with his business activities. Criminal case has been proceeded.
dear viewers, we have to interrupt our translation due to urgent announcement from embattled White House.
as it has become known, convocation of deputies has impeached President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin.
Hello, girls! Hello, boys!
on page thirteen there is article with my picture. Alexander Blo!
soviet mentality? It has to be squeezed as a pimple, drop after drop.
what is soviet mentality? I have never quite had it, but I lost it after working several years as a taxi driver in New York.
as we say it in commercial business - different cultural references. Bingo!
what is soviet mentality or sovok I didn't understand entirely. But, according to my new boss Dmitri Pugin, I didn't have to understand anything.
I had to manage it.
you see, sovok produces hardly anything himself.
but people need someting to eat and wear.
thus, western production will be flooding here soon.
together with it there will be wave of commercials, but we can't just translate these commercials from English to Russian because here are different...how was it?...cultural references.
me and you, we think up...understand, think up... dummies for all important brands.
as soon as time comes we go to agency with folder in our hands and make business.
try Sprite for starters. They intend to enter Russia.
taking in consideration requests adressed to me by leaders of objects in Russian Federation, deputies, members of parliament, citizens of Russia, I have decided on the following...
as you know, in Western Europen countries Coca-Cola is more of an ideological fetish than refreshing drink.
if, for example, Hershey drinks posesses taste of victory, then Coca-Cola posesses taste of freedom.
get to the point. Okay.
let's look at classic slogan: Sprite - The Uncola. For our consumer term "Uncola" posesses wide antidemocratic and antiliberal connotations which make it very attractive in state of military dictatorship.
translating to Russian, Uncola woud be Ne-kola. Sounding similar to name Nikola and with associations in mind this word perfectly fits in aesthetics of plausible future. Possible versions of slogans:
sprite - Ne-kola for Nikola.
probable text for commercial.
I drank birch Sprite in forest in spring!
the Uncola is slogan of Seven-Up, not Sprite.
that's nothing. We can use it. Let's assume you've passed your exam. Now try some other brand.
yes? Which one?
it is completely clear that, in order to make serious conception on Parliament commercial, we must first of all take in account...
what must we first of all take in account was completely unclear.
parliament - the Unjava.
Tihamat 2 Earth sea. Chronological tables and appendices.
I had found this folder in waste paper which we were sent to gather after school.
as a child I was ashamed of my name and tried to pretend to be Vova whenever possible.
it turned out that my given name surprised me in the moment when I had completely forgotten about the role which, as I told my friends, secret doctrines of Babylon had to play in my life.
legend of Great Lottery inspired me particulary. More precise version of translation - Game without name.
according to this legend, way to wealth and total wisdom went through sexual union with golden idol of goddess Ishtar.
any resident of Babylon could become goddesses husband.
in order to do that he had to drink ritual beverage of heavenly fly-agarics, then go up ziggurat and solve three godesses riddles.
riddles of Ishtar were presented by three symbolic objects which were handed to babylonian wanting to become priest of goddess.
he had to explain meaning of these objects. Those, who solved even one riddle incorrectly, where thrown down by guards and it meant certain death.
man who solved all three riddles correctly climbed on the top, met the goddess and became her ritual earthly husband.
Gireyev?
Tatarskiy. It's not possible to recognize you. Well, how are you doing?
complete harmony. And you? Where are you hurrying?
I have a rough time now. I communicate mostly with businessmen and advertising agents.
they put heavy load on me! Some couple of those advertising agents came to me in Rastorguyevo in winter, and after that they ran naked through the snow.
let's go to my place and you will see for yourself.
Gireyev, in his wild clothing, seemed like last shard of destroyed universe. Not Soviet but of some other existing parallel with Soviet world and even in spite of it, but destroyed together with it.
what is this? Fly-agaric.
are you gonna drink this? Don't worry. There are no Tawny Grisette's in it.
such beverage was made in ancient Babylon, by the way.
only they added urine of red ox together with fly-agarics.
correct. That makes it milder.
what should I do now? Do what you want.
can I talk? Go on.
have you heard about Lesha Chikunov?
imagine, he drank some bottles of Finlandia and froze to death in starry January night in little house in childern's playground.
went to Valhalla...paradise of Scandinavian warriors.
have you got more?
dried fly-agaric remind potato crisps by the taste. A little bit. Only they are tastier than crisps.
what if to sell them like crisps in packages?
what is that?
Aum. That the way I travel. Where to?
where to? It's hard to explain where to.
much becomes clear when you stop thinking.
advertising conception for fly-agaric.
highest form of self-realization for fly-agaric as a mushroom is nuclear blast.
sort of a glowing and unsubstantial body which posesses some advanced mysticism.
people are just auxiliary life form which fly-agarics use for achieving their higher goal.
how strange it all turns out.
Chikunov died but we keep on living.
it's just that I suspect that every time we go to sleep we die exactly like that.
death is exchanging usual morning awakening with something else, only we have no possibility to think about it because our mind and the world...
is one and the same. So there are no death.
threads disappear but pearls remain intact.
Why? Because preads disappera but searls remain intact.
what?
I'd like to wrink dater.
confounding of speech was called rising the Tower of Babel.
maybe they drank this fly-agaric tea and words began to break in their mouths just like it happens with me now.
won't you tell me how to go to station?
where telectric train is?
stop fooling around, bastard! Where telectric train is...
to meet Hussein now...interesting, would he be startled?
what do you want?
just one minute. I just wanted to ask you, as a member of target group, what associations word "parliament" incites in you?
there was a poem...
parliament of Birds.
thirty birds went looking for bird named Semurg king of all birds and great master.
how did all that end? When they had overcome thirty tests they found out "Semurg" means "thirty birds."
do NOT MAKE CAMPFIRES! What is "tower creation" anyway?
creation of a tower, not building.
when confounding of speech occures, Tower of Babel comes in existance.
or, perhaps, not comes into existance, rather door to ziggurat simply opens?
Yes, sure. Here is the entrance.
everything is not so simple. It is something like huge garage.
forward! To the hanging gardens.
three riddles of Ishtar. Everything fits.
poster depicts bank of Moscow river. Historic tanks from 93 in foreground.
we see huge package of Parliament in the place of White House.
there are plenty of palm-trees growing around it. Slogan:
and Motherland's smoke is sweet and pleasant to us. Parliament.
brilliant, Tatarksiy. You've hit the bull's eye. This very moment package of Parliament costs the same as package of Marlboro.
after these events, I think, it will cost twice as much.
Congratulations.
there are two methods of advertising, but, in our opinion, first of all name-change of company must be considered.
tampako - drink made of tampons?
[Under the wing of mighty company] Agents of Rosgovstrah fly over city and help all of the needy. Guardian angels!
let's implicate "diesel" in chastuska:
I and Ivan Ilyich worked on the diesel, I'm a dummy, he's a dummy, and our diesel got filched.
that's all. Young people are ours.
let's look at scrip of commercial clip. Young man, similar to protagonist from movie Brat
sits on the bench. Cut to the next scene.
well dressed man comes out of mansion. He looks around worried and rushes to the car.
young man puts two Tic-Tac's in his hand, throws them in his mouth and shuts his eyes because of pleasure.
voice behind the scenes: Bro liked the coolness, he fried all others.
tic-tac with menthol, real explosion of taste.
hallo. Good day. This is Vladimir Hanin from Secret Advisor agency.
I got your number from Dima Pugin. Couldn't we meet today? Better right away.
what's happened? Dima kicked the bucket.
I know you worked with him. And he worked with me. So we are kind of acquainted.
how did it happen? That was robber, it seems, knew
Pugin had worked as a taxi driver in New York. Forty Sixth and Broadway...
that's all he managed to tell the police and doctors. Seven gunshot wounds were found. Seven.
they were shot right through the back of the seat.
let's commemorate him!
let's get through your latest works, of course, if you have no objections.
I assume you understand Dmitri brought them to me.
parliament...
there is nothing I can say. Good.
Next...there you have got problems. Big ones.
Tampako. One of your advices offended them badly.
but name "Tampako" is really repellent.
our business is a lottery, you know.
you are not lucky in this lottery lately.
and I know why.
Why?
you...don't believe in what you do. You don't participate with your soul. Well, I don't!
you want me to let this Tampako in my soul?
no whoever in Pushkin Square would do that. Don't strike a pose.
you misunderstood me. Posture is the same for all of us. Why do I tell that whore wouldn't do that?
the thing is not in repulsion. Whore get money in any case whether client likes her or not.
I must firstly...
no whore are gonna work on such conditions.
whore, perhaps, won't work but we will if we want to survive in this business.
we will do much more.
are you gonna join my staff?
what position? Creator.
that is [creator in Russian]? If to translate.
we need [creator in Russian] like shit. Creator, Vavan. Creator.
let's get acquainted. Vavilen Tatarskiy. Please, love and and have pity on him.
each brand has its legend - what is that?
legend - that's how we translate "brand essence" And brand essence is...
concentrated expression of all image policy. Brand essence of Marlboro is...
land of cowboys and follow cowboys?
don't be afraid, this is Malyuta. Malyuta, say "hello." Attaboy.
we had sergeant in our company, surname Harley.
beast of a man.
but he drinked himself to death. How come?
simply there is no life for Russian man now.
for how much more Davidsons will be riding our Harleys? Russia, wake up!
is this a parody, Malyuta? You know, Tatarskiy...
I have seen your work. You did good with Sprite, but all the rest...small matters.
you don't need to orientate yourself on Atlantic values. We are Eurasians.
little, vietnamese village. Last American war prisoners are there.
they have piles of Nike sneakers in different stages of completion in front of them.
at first they growl quietly, then they tap with footwear... We want American consul! I'm begging you!
and then - burst of machine gun!
tall, handsome Vietnamese with smoking machine gun appears on the doorstep.
he says in clean English:
just do it! Nike. Good wins.
what is this?
you think customer will like this commercial? We ourselves tell customer what he likes and what he does not like.
tell me, why do people commission us to make commercials?
to sell the goods.
to sell the goods...let it be. But that's in America. But why do our people do that?
maybe to feel themselves powerful. Powerful...that was some three years ago.
now it is different. Nowadays client wants to show to big daddies, who follow very carefully what's going on the screen and in life, too, that he can take a million dollars and throw them in garbage bin without thinking.
the worse commercial is, the better.
tricky. Yeah, it's not the same thing as reading Al Ries.
ishtar
hello.
what sizes do you have? This is the only left.
exactly your size. Two thousand rubles. I take it.
tell me, please, what is there...
Ouija board. Paper goes in here
here you put pen, better ball pen. Hands are put like this.
I'm showing you. You contact a spirit.
you allow hands to move freely.
pen will write down message received. Listen, don't be angry, but I need to know which spirit.
if you take it, I will tell you. I take it. How much?
seventeen thousand. Oh, seventeen thousand...
what are you by occupation?
what do you do? Commercials.
it would be better for you to avoid any contacts with spirits. That will offend them the least.
Interesting...how do spirits guess that I work in the field of advertising? Is that written on my forehead?
no. It is written on commercial that it came out of your head.
I summon spirit of Che Guevara.
I want to know...let's say...something new about commercials.
so that I understood more than the rest.
future depends on you. According to burgeois thought, every man is cell of organism called Economics.
but we call it simpler - Oranus, which means "moutharse" in Russian.
each cell of Oranus, e. g. man with his economic qualities, has its own socio-psychic membrane allowing money to go in and out.
these processes are regulated by nervous system of Oranus - television and mass media.
personality of man gradually decreases and man becomes program looking another program.
there are three kinds of impulses Oranus sends throughout its virtual organism:
oral, anal and extracting WOW-impulse [named after] commercial interjection "Wow!
man is a wolf to man" said some winged Latin words.
but for a long time already man is not a wolf to man, man is not even image maker to man, not a dealer, not a killer, not even distributor as modern soiciologists suggest.
all is much more horrifying and simpler: Man is WOW to man.
not a man, but exactly the same WOW, so that projecting this Latin saying in contemporary system of cultural coordinates it sounds like: WOW WOW WOW.
one can't understand Russia using mind, Russian can only be believed in...
Smirnoff. How's the beat? Do you snuff?
it happens. From time to time. That's bad. Membranes in the nose is almost the same as open brain.
where has this powder come from? Who put in what places? Have you ever thought about that?
one must live clean.
how's that? Only LSD.
only on empty stomach and only with prayer.
fucking incredible! So much different ones.
do they work differently?
Why? Picture is the most important thing.
you can't escape the fact. You swallow Mel Gibson or red clove... These three identical, what are they?
what is that man depicted? With hat and beard? I don't know who that is.
but this thing is special: acid mixed with, And dose is enough for company of soldiers.
how much? Hundred and fifty [thousand].
I have only hundred [thousand] left. Okay, give it here.
do you want to die?
Sirruf has arrived. What?
do you at least know this pass was meant for four people?
you are only one here. Or are there four of you?
please, don't do this to me anymore. I made a mistake. I understand I shouldn't look at Tower of Babel.
tower of Babel can not be seen. One can only climb up there. I am telling you this as the guardian of the tower.
the thing you see is tophet. What is tophet?
that is the place were people were sacrificed by fire.
I don't understand! You can consider tophet to be ordinary TV-set.
am I in TV? In some sense, yes. You see technical universe in which your world is burning down.
fire, in which you burn, must be serviced. And you are one of maintenance staff.
maintenance staff? You are copywriter, aren't you?
so you are one of those who make people stare into flame of consumerism.
agree that it's better to warm by this fire than to burn alive in it.
listen, I'm in a trouble. I've overdosed acid. I am reading mantra in such cases. Write it down.
what does it mean? It doesn't matter. Do you have vodka?
your mantra does not work, Gireyev.
damn, I am so guilty before you, Lord.
I live bad and uncorrect, I know.
but I have nothing foul in my soul, word of honour.
I won't eat this stuff anymore.
I just want to be happy.
but I do not succeed.
I deserve so!
but I know nothing more apart from writing bad slogans.
but for you, Lord, I will write good one. Word of honour.
they position you completely wrong. They don't dig it at all.
just to take this last clip...they gather money for this church. There is this old woman with a box.
she gets a ruble from man driving Zaporozhets, then hundred bucks from Mercedes.
idea is clear, but positioning does not suit at all.
the one driving Mercedes is ashamed being after Zaparozhets. Everybody knows that.
we need Mercedes drivers as target group.
script for commercial.
long, white limousine in front of Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.
rear door is open. Light pours out of it.
out of light comes sandal lightly touching the asphalt. And hand touches door handle.
we don't see the face. Just light, hand and foot.
slogan: Solid Lord for solid gentlemen.
Lord, do yo like it?
hello. Vavan, how are you?
so... Did it come right?
more or less. Better tell me what was that mantra you gave me.
that is no mantra. That is a sentence in Hebrew. It means: "Give me a cucumber."
real mantra. If you put "Aum" at the end...
alright. Take care.
I'm going for beer.
let's go.
why couldn't you explain yourself like a man? Why did you abandon the kiosk?
I was drunk.
what do you do now?
I work. Where?
who's that?
Acquantance. He has nothing to to with this.
with whom am I speaking?
Hanin?
Hello, Hanin.
who am I?
my name is Hussein. I am member of Caucasian folk.
this is where you, shitface, are hiding!
you wanted to hide, didn't you? Wanted to get away?
don't tense up. Sure, he is merchant, but he is my merchant.
what? He was my merchant when were still pasturing goat in the hills. I was not pasturing nanny-goats, rather billy-goats.
if you came here to butt, I will put a ring in your nose. Ring, you say...
this one.
alright. Let's meet tomorrow and discuss things. Ten o'clock in the evening.
I take the young man. He comes with me.
do get acquainted. This is Vavan Tatarskiy, one of our best specialists. This is Vovchik Maloy. Almost your namesake. He is also called Nietzschean.
that's bullshit. That was long ago. Anyway, he is our roof. He has a commission for you.
listen carefuly and memorize. You will write it down.
do you feel humiliations when you are abroad?
I hardly go there. Good boy.
when you go you will feel it. I tell it for sure.
they don't consider us to be people.
they think we are all shit and beasts. Why is there such attitude? Any opinions?
because we watch their movies, drive their cars and even eat their food.
we produce only dough which, according to all thoughts, are also theirs - dollars.
sure, I am no economist, but I feel... The things is fishy.
there is some shame buried.
spirituality has gone missing somewhere in all this. But we are Russia! Just think about it - mighty country. You agree?
listen, state the task. He is my head creator. In one minute he earns more than we both together in a week.
okay, I will simply explain this to you.
our business goes out to international arena.
there are many kinds of dough swirling around - Chechen, Colombian... You get the idea.
if you look at them as simply dough, they are all the same.
but there is some national idea standing behind every dough.
we had this communism, but now it has ended and we have no idea at all. Except dough.
but there is no way dough could stand behind dough because then it is unclear why ones are in front and others are behind.
learn Vavan! Checens have got it. We have not.
that is why they look at us like at shit.
we need simple, clear Russian idea.
so that I could take any bitch from any Harward and in easy words explain...and no need to look at me like that.
so that they wouldn't think that we, in Russia, have stolen the money and put iron door in front of it.
so that these biches felt such spirituality as in 45 years ago! At Stalingrad! Understand?
in the beginning I didn't find this task to be hard. But, once sitting behind the table, I realized with terror that nothing, absolutely nothing comes in mind.
fyodor Mihailovich, wouldn't you tell what Russian national idea is?
after summoning spirit of Dostoyevsky on which I put particular hopes, there was some side effects.
sure, I could comfort myself with assumption that Russian idea was so transcendental that this was only way to at least record it on paper.
come on in.
anyway, I wrote what I could...
but I think I have flopped and this can't be shown to Vovochka.
Well...forget it. Vovchik was busted.
how? Simple.
he had shoot out with your Chechens yesterday.
the swines dug entrenchment on nearby hill. When he drove over, they blasted from two rocket launchers "Shmel..." Horrific stuff. Have you heard about such?
Vovchik had armoured car, but it was armoured against normal people, not some degenerates.
what does that mean for us? Time off.
indefinite time off. There were two telephone calls already.
police? Police. And Caucasians. They tell: we know you have got diamonds.
what diamons? What diamonds do I have? I don't know...
okay, calm down.
keep on living, loving, working... Hello? Yes, he's with me.
he is on his way. Go, they wait for you in parlour.
hello. Hello.
what mug have you got! Need a job? I need a job.
let's go. I will explain you on the way.
what a car...
do you like it? Sure!
it turns on oral WOW factor. It sure does. That's why we drive it.
listen, where are we going? I don't want to spoil the impression.
behave naturally. Don't say anything excessive.
what does "excessive" mean? Sentences like this one.
ministry of communications. Institute of apiculture.
don't be afraid to look like a fool, Vavilen. On the contrary, don't look too smart.
more cynicism.
have a seat.
we are already seaten.
like it? Sure. Piaget Possession, if I'm not mistaken. It costs 170 000 dollars.
Piaget...really. Nothing gives away man's affiliation with lower classes like skill to know expensive watches, cars... Stop smartmouthing!
how was it? Great. Just great.
I don't understand why is there such technology. That is exclusive, but somewhat unusual.
did you see this poster in front of our office? Institute of Apiculture?
we here...
...as if bees...
stop! You wait with Alla. I will have some words with a man.
have a seat. Go on.
leonid Azadovskiy.
vladimir Tatarskiy. You are not Vladimir, but Vavilen. I know about it.
well...I have read your works.
and, you know...
I liked them. We need things like that.
but there are moments when I don't believe truly. You write...collective unconsciousness.
do you know yourself what is it? Well, on the level of collective unconscousness.
aren't you afraid there is somebody who knows for sure?
Mr. Azadovskiy, I am not afraid. I am not afraid because everybody who knows for sure, what collective unconsciousness is, long since sell cigarettes in subway. Well, in one way or another, I want to say.
do you at least believe in anything?
I don't.
alright.
what's next? Political views...
it is written: [upper left] ... I don't understand. Shit, soon they will be writing everything in English.
so, what are you by your political view?
marketer. Rather radical one. And more precisely?
more precisely? Let's say...
I like it when life has...big tits. And so called Kantesque tit doesn't move me at all, regardless of how much milk it has got.
keep looking!
go on! What were you saying about tits? Just keep it short.
if short...in tit market only Feuerbachesque tit moves me.
that's what I think. Better be it small...
but Feuerbachesque.
that's what I wanted to hear. Have you done the control?
I praise you.
what's that? Rostrapovich.
take him by the paws. Front paws. Strech him like little Jesus.
Lord's hamster Rostrapovich is being decorated...
what does he get decoration for? I'm in a good mood. Jealous?
why does he have such strange name? Vavilen, who would've talked, but you...
can I? Shitty question.
madman, where are you going! Don't you see I wash here? Sorry. Nice institute you've got here.
it happens frequently: you go on the street in early summer morning and see big, nice, speeding world full of promises and happiness dissolved in heaven. And suddenly there is this piercing feeling for a fraction of second that there is life spread out before you and you can go forth without looking back, risk with yourself and win, fly on white motorboat across its sees, drive white Mercedes across its roads, and nobody would dare to call you in American word "loser."
excuse me, Mr. military man, wouldn't you tell me if I get to the center by this road?
it was much more greater in Kandahar! Sorry.
fucking fool!
think! Whom would you believe: soulless commercial or your family doctor?
here you go.
Yeah, he began running so fast only after upgrade. Before we needed two days for such bulletin, now we do it overnight.
that's why we can count in more gestures, facial expressions. What counting?
Azadovskiy says you love it when life has big tits. Arkasha, you will be laughing but we must do it one more time.
this is the biggest one! Have another glass. You're still tense.
how much more?
who is that? Arkasha. Earlier he played roles in Shakespeare plays.
what is he doing?
you will see now.
what are those buttons attached to him? Transmitters.
Arkahsa moves, we pick up the trajectory, combine it with model and...
do the thing with your hand majestically and slower.
listen, why is he depicted drunk if he's virtual? Higher raitings for TV channel.
why does minute on prime-time cost forty thousand dollars?
Render-server 100/400. We can calculate up to hundred big and four hundred second-rate politicians.
do Americans have the same? They have ten times bigger.
look what characters do we have: Yeltsin, Zyuganov, Zhirinovskiy... Chekhov, "Three Sisters."
but this is huge fraud? Nonsense! We make their lives easier.
by its nature, every politicians is a TV-program. Those who move are half-dummies, those who don't move - simply dummies.
Tuborg. Two.
we write speeches for politicians, but who gives the objective? Who decides which way national politics will turn?
Oligarchs? Oligarchs also are our clients.
simply half of them is for leader to put to use. We drive them around benefit nights, news, trials.
one can say, we fuck their wifes for them.
that is how?
wait, there are people who meet them every day...
there are secret service called "Will of People." More than hundred people from former KGB. Azadovskiy feeds them all.
this is their job to go around and tell they have seen our leaders just moments ago.
someone beside three-storey cottage, other with underage hooker, some in yellow Lamborghini on Rublevski highway.
wait, where does all of this lean upon?
what are you doing?
do not think about this. Never.
could you turn up the volume?
my sonny made this commercial. I haven't seen it yet.
...I drank birch Sprite in forest in spring...
bitches!
who? If only I knew.
blo! Hello.
you too here? Are you in compromising?
how do you know? Everybody starts there. To acquire skill.
where do you work? Department of Russian Idea. There, in the wing.
if you have an idea, come by, okay? There's little use of me. I tried to think couple of times, nothing good.
you know, drive around outskirsts and ask people. I tried that in the beginning.
you give him a glassful, look into his eyes, but he answers: "Fuck the hell off, damn mercedes!
they can't imagine anything greater than Mercedes. Very destructive.
this one yours?
Yeah, mine. Forty minutes of shame and you're at work.
alright, everything is ahead. Bye. Bye.
...exchange with democracy and add black rethorics! Malyuta!
how did you get here? I write image-menu for all.
have you heard about spiked kvass with horseraddish? Or pancakes with fish?
all of those are my hits. You know each other, right?
so-so. We sat together. At Hanin's. So you will have no problems working together.
Yes, Monopoly in Russia is a problem. You buy some streets and then turns out pople are living there.
and people think those are their streets. Not exactly so. In our days people get to know what they think from TV.
so, if you want to buy couple of streets and not to have pale look afterwards, you have to make sure your TV-tower hangs above them beforehand.
I sell my TV-announcer. I don't like television. I buy it.
what's up, Salman? I feel jumpy. My head is not armoured, no question about it, but your is also like that. You know it.
my infantry all around here. What were you told through transmitter?
it is written in Forbes that you grab everything as you run. But every man grabbing everything as he runs, Forbes continue, must be prepared that one day he will be grabbed. Your infantry takes a rest.
you subscribe Forbes? Sure. Chechenya is in Europe now.
if you're so cultured, why do you grab the gun? Let's do it like two Europeans, without these wolfish ways.
by the way, who is filming us with hidden camera? What camera?
what is that case on the windowsill?
listen, Tatarskiy...
where do you work? In PR department of LogoVaz or in my department of compromising?
in department of compromising. If I didn't knew this Berezovsky was created within these walls
I'd think you get your salary from him. And Raduyev?
he's like professor of holy scriptures. He reads magazines even I haven't heard about.
But...there must be some logic in development of story.
I don't need logic. I need compromising. And this is no compromising. This is shit. Understood?
well, there is some good grain. It incites hatred against television. One wants to watch it and hate it.
an another "pro":
monopoly.
you thought it up yourself? I did.
that's a fortune: oligarch and terrorist divides national goods behind gaming-table.
hatred will thrive.
wouldn't it be too much? No. People must have their brains occupied, let their emotions burn out.
so, this Monopoly thing is not bad. It will get up our rating for at least five per cent. Sit.
well...
let them play Monopoly. We'll tell the director to cut in various scenes: lines at savings banks, miners, old folk, hungry children, wounded soldiers...
you know, Markovin, involve in this Malyuta from geopolitics department. Get the material fast. Hot.
well, do we have anything more? Commercials of new type.
get rolling! We have twenty more minutes.
russia MOMMY
Kolya OGORODNIKOV
well?
I don't understand a thing. What do they sell? Yeah, what product?
pickles.
you don't understand one thing. We don't infuse with pickles, but with patriotism.
breaking news! Secret negotiations between Raduyev and Berezovsky. You will see how oligarch and terrorist plan to monopolize natural resources and human consciousness.
what cataclysms do they prepare for Russia?
today, 10 PM, Farskeykin show.
take this.
twenty from Berezov.
ten from Basayev. And two from Wahhabi.
I don't understand. Do they give us their money so that we would compromise them?
again?
I told you: don't take it in your head.
if you are given money, somebody must have reason to do so.
you yourself must do the pinching!
as soon as something like that comes into yor mind, pinch yourself or prick with something sharp.
you know, for this purpose I have got a pin. English pin.
I have it from year 96.
when I have these thoughts in my head...
I open it at once.
so it is.
quiet.
I will explain everything.
who was the last one to use Ivanov? Seva, as usual. What's happened?
you changed cigaretes on your own, bitch! You yourself wanted montage with Gitanes. Anti-american coalition...
whom are you lying to, scumbag! Whom are you lying to! We have two-year deal with Camel!
wait, I have something important to tell...
wait, I want to tell important...
did you see bulletin? I did. He waves package of Gitanes throughout the whole interview.
when must it be aired? - Tomorrow. And what should we do?
exchange Gitanes for Camel!
go or I'll kill you!
make some suggestions.
maybe we could put his hand into plaster so that package couldn't be seen.
exactly. He was attacked. Attempt to blow up his car.
what legend do we make? Legend must be plain and simple.
chechens, Islamic factor...
suicide bomber in old Mercedes hits his car...
it's brilliant, but where can we get old Mercedes at 10 AM?
maybe, Zhiguli? What Zhiguli! Mercedes! Solid and for sure!
one don't economize on quality.
I saw white Mercedes in our parking-lot. Someone drives white Mercedes...
go on! Faster!
I got new cover there... You fucking lost your mind! What are you thinking!
now you go to film crash with Mercedes and Volga. Take this asshole Seva and put him in one of the driver's seats.
I need explosion! Blood and shards.
today on Naberezhnaya there was an attemp to kill general Ivanov who was on his way to parliament.
Mercedes filled with explosives hit Volga. By miracle general remained alive, but his driver perished. Criminal case has been iniciated.
I think all leads found in scene of the crime point to Chechens. You can see exclusive footage...
...listen, Azadovsky was in two clips yesterday. I see him every time I turn on TV. What does all this mean?
does he like having himself filmed? Yes, he's got such weakness.
this is my advice for you: don't stick your nose into it for now. Perhaps you will get to know later. Agreed?
alright. Turn on the TV. Get to work right away! We have a crysis. Seva has deleted the government.
what does "deleted the government" mean? He wrote a program which was supposed to delete whole folder at the end of the month.
he put it inside file Kireyenko. Then this program infected whole government. After that - everything to default.
he wanted to tell something important before he died.
it's a pity this scumbag got such an easy death.
get ready. The driver, Kolya, is waiting for you downstairs.
...no ikons, no Gordayev, no show "The Third Eye" will save from villains who steal oil and gas" Advertising service of Russian Radio.
and now news of Russian Radio. We have received report from Kremlin just now that president Yeltsin has signed order about dismissing Kireyenko's government.
candidature of new Prime Minister is not asserted yet. It is possible to say Russia has no government at the moment.
Vavilen Vladimirovich, how to go on living if you don't believe in anything?
if you have conscience, you will surrend your seat to old lady although you don't want to do it.
that's the whole truth of life.
well, what is said...
the strong help the weak.
but not at us. At us it is - smother.
rake more and put guards in addition. So that it wouldn't get stolen.
you're a joker, Nikolai.
Vavilen Vladimirovich, I have got a joker in my pants.
perhaps, we drop a hint to change in course? What?
we broadcast something... What do we broadcast?
what is usually broadcasted in such cases? Swan Lake. You know...
by the way, according to prophecy of Ilyin authoritative regime, national by its inclination, will be reborn in Russia.
do you understand where does it lead? No, I don't understand!
we are the Third Rome, the one which is on Volka. From here comes our complete historical self-sufficiency and national virtue...
Yeah...yeah...harsh. What?
you remember, Philotheus said there would be no forth Rome... You remember?
and said: Drink that day. But he didn't say which day exactly.
so, let's be drinking every day in order not to miss that day.
why are you buffooning all the time, shitface? What did you yourself propose?
I propose a toast to you, Marlen, to your wooden mind.
why are you squabbling? Why are you squabbling, fucker?
and why are you? What did you say?
how was this discharge? Great!
exactly. If you want then do it properly. We need to give people a show.
then it will forget about everything: mommy, daddy, work, wife. And most important - it will forget about government.
by the way, good brawl could substitute governement.
but who will be so sharp?
you haven't understood yet, have you?
we will create him ourselves. Can we do it? We can. Just give the shape.
we wil draw him and then even put in Kremlin.
we look at poor man...
we know liars. It was shown on TV - all mafia. Just give him those fifty kopeck.
you're mistaken. Why do you believe that box all the time?
real mafia are those who sit by the joysticks - five men manipulating with us. It won't work!
here is Kolya. Our prototype.
Kolya, our advertising agency needs you. I am no Snickers to be advertised.
name? Name? Ivanov.
lame. Vasiliy?
no, Vasya, that's... How do you like Smirnov?
good Russian last name, but, most important, world's biggest brand.
during preelections we start advertising campaign for Smirnoff vodka, thus we can flood city with commercials.
Nostrils...change nostrils a bit.
no, not here... Movements must be more convincing, much more convincing than in life.
now turn him around. Don't be afraid of nothing. We'll sort out everything.
brilliant. Good. Beauty. Go on with computing.
preelection race has begun...
attacker turned out to be former fighter pilot Nikolai Smirnov whom we found in a vehicle...
Nikolai, why did you make the brawl... I can't stand ?
do you intend to get involved in politics or are you weak?
don't call me weak, get it?
leader of the race is still KPRF, according to news more than 24% of electorate had voted for them until 14: 00.
peak of communism? Rating of KPRF higher than ever. Smirnov: "Attention!
pushed - and pushed out. Inciator of brawl in Council runs for president.
Smirnov - our saviour? Smirnov went good! Summary of first degustation of new candidate for president.
Smirnov goes from brawlers to rulers.
add moustache and decorations.
Sveta, I asked you not to call me at work!
why is he beaming like a dumbass? Take that smile away.
my friends, did I think when I was little boy in Siberia that I would stand by the wheel of such a huge machine?
but, with such team as we have, even devil himself is harmless. TAMPAKS. The reds won't get through!
cunning. People won't even notice we don't infuse with hydrogen pads but with anxiety.
and then - boom! - Smirnov. As only answer to created anxiety.
you're a genius after all, Vava. Son of a bitch.
hello. Markovin, look left righ away.
do you know what it is? Oh, this...Azadovskiy told recently.
it was mean to be AAW station, some kind of. And then, you understand yourself...
how is the station, we're going to, called? Rastorguyevo. Classic, dirty boozer in Moscov suburbs.
leva likes to drink beer there in order to realize what he has achieved in life. Hello, folk!
how is my folk drinking?
Vava, I have a request for you. Let's go outside and talk.
two of my brother moved here from Yerevan and decided to open their business.
exclusive funeral parlour with higher class services.
I ask you as a friend, write some normal slogan which would really work on target group.
how is the business called? By last name. Funeral parlour of brothers Debirsian.
you will be laughing, but one of your acquaintances was our client.
who was it? Hanin. Agency "Secret Advisor."
he was busted. By whom?
it's a dark story. Something in connection with diamonds. I'll go to take a tinkle. Wait me here.
I'm standing, buying half a liter of vodka in grocery store Kurskova. Suddenly, you imagine, there comes in...Smirnov! Damn!
grey coat, mohair scarf and a cap. No bodyguards around. Just in right pocket there's a bulge as if there is a gun inside.
I'm watching with my mouth open, he noticed it, winked his eye, and off out on the street.
such things happen! Damn. This Smirnov is one cool guy...
will of People?
take care of him.
guys, everything is OK. I'm friendly troops.
diamonds are not forever. Funeral parlour of brothers Debirsian.
fucking diamonds?
Tatarskiy! Will of People!
what is the choice of Russia? Russia chooses Smirnov.
why is it turned upside down?
long talk. Where do you come from?
it's long talk as well.
yes? Vavan, you alive? Where are you?
alive... These dumbasses were beaten just now, probably sent to jail.
Azadovskiy laughed so much after interrogation. He said you took all stress away from him.
next time you'll get decorated together with Rostrapovich. Should I send a car for you?
no, thanks, I will go home. Nerves don't work. Yea...I can understand. Go and heal yourself.
just don't be late tomorrow. We have very important event - Azadovskiy's collection. Spanish selection.
you know, they consider me to be a hamster.
what? It's not important.
have you got more fly-agaric?
I have. But I won't be taking them with you. After that case...sorry.
I will pour you some vodka. It hits so hard on your brain when pure. Vodka calms it down.
you know, Andryuha, I don't want it to sound pathetic but many thanks to you.
what for? For allowing to live parallel life sometimes.
without it real one would be so repulsive...
just don't be late tomorrow. We have very important event...
arrived? Where are we?
in Ostankino. Sorry for blindfold and stuff... You yourself understand - ritual and traditions.
afraid?
don't be afraid. It's all nonsense.
Alla! Show him everything. I have some business to attend.
whom of great Spaniards do you love the most?
velazquez. Me, too. I'm dead gone for the old man.
how do you do, Farsuk Karlovich? This one's Picasso. Ceramic Figure of a Running Woman.
this sculpture was bought for seventeen million dollars.
but where is the sculpture itself? If you're interested you can have a look at how it looks like.
there is a catalogue on that table. This is the current tendency in design. Monetaristic minimalism.
it was born in Russia. Do you like it?
interesting. Though not completely understandable. I will explain. Take a walk.
if honestly, you saw a picture once, twice... and what new will you see there after that?
nothing. Exactly. We will return here later. To have champagne.
bend you heard. Ceilings are low there.
put it on.
let's go. Where to?
don't be afraid. It's all friendly troops in there.
don't fidget. And don't betray us. Don't think we are all fucked up here.
I don't give a damn, but you can't do without it in our business.
have you been in pioneer camps? I have.
remember, there was this Neptune day when everybody was was being poured over with water?
Yes, it was so. Pretend this is such Neptune day. Tradition.
anyway, the thing is this. There was once an ancient goddess. According to this legend gods are also mortal and die exactly like men.
it was time for this goddess to die, she, naturally, didn't want to and she divided herself in her death and her not wanting to die.
she became gold, but not a metal. In figural sense, understand?
she became that which crave all human beings. All gold in general.
but her death became a lame dog with five paws who must always lie in some faraway northern country.
this is him depicted. See? With a paw instead of a dick. I read something of the kind in my university books.
what book? About our office? No, about heathen gods.
there was a lame dog with five paws named Pisdets among these gods.
according to legend, this dog lies somewhere far away in snow. When he aways, it will set in.
I didn't get it.
to whom will this pisdets set in?
it's not that it will set in to somebody or something. It will be pisdets for everything.
how is the goddess called? She has no name.
once, long ago, she was called Ishtar.
it's the same with lame dog. But you said correctly all the rest. I think you understand particular responsibility lays on Russian people.
because the dog is lying exactly here.
stand on your knees. Take off the mask.
you are the medium and you are the message.
what is that liquid? Dog's blood.
I hope I don't have to explain symbolism?
no. I'm no fool. I have read something.
what's next? Next you have to look inside Sacred Eye.
don't be afraid. Through this eye goddess recognizes her husband.
since she already has a husband, this is pure formality. It's quite tense when somebody else looks inside the Sacred Eye.
but it's been good so far. So, go on.
what's up? What's going on?
there is nothing going on. Everything has gone by.
but why?
it was predicted by orale that Isthar would have new husband on our country.
we have been experiencing problems with Azadovskiy for a long time already.
but we couldn't understand who the new one was.
the only thing know was...he would be a man with name of a city.
we thought, we searched... Then your file is brought to me from Department One.
and it turns out you, Vavilen, are the one as far as we're concerned.
me? But why me?
I don't know. Ask yourself. Goddess didn't choose me for some reason.
will I get strangled some day? That's part of the profession.
if you have any problems, come straight to me. Here's the first advice.
as soon as you move into Azadovskiy's office, throw the hell out that cocaine-soaked carpet.
Farsuk Karlovich, tell me a secret...
who is actually in charge?
here's second advice for you. Don't stick your nose in. You will be alive god for longer.
although, honestly speaking, I don't know myself despite being in business for so many years.
what's this? 3-D scanner. Newest model. It was brought yesterday.
according to ritual, husband of the great goddess must be digitalized. Come here.
don't be afraid! Scanning is not painful at all. Sit down.
hold your back straight. This will be your main sacral function.
well, husband of the great goddess won't be you, rather your 3-D model. You will be kind of regent or something.
don't pay attention. It's calibration.
Farsuk Karlovich... Yea?
have you heard about a bird named Semurg?
I haven't. What's that bird?
there was this Eastern poem...I haven't read it myself, just heard about it.
it's about thirthy birds looking for their king Semurg.
overcoming multitue of various tests, they found out "Semurg" means "thirty birds."
so what? Nothing.
I just thought our generation which chose Pepsi...
perhaps we all together are this lame dog with five paws.
and now we are, so to say, setting in.
so, freeze now and don't wink.
ready? Ready!
I am bowing down before living god...
hello.
hello. I am bowing down before living god.
what are the orders for today, chief? No orders for now.
although, no. You know what? There will be something.
firstly, let carpet in office be taken away, I've fed up with it.
secondly, from this day there should be only Coca Cola in refreshment room, and no Pepsi.
thirdly, Malyuta doesn't work for us anymore.
Why? Because we need him as much as dog needs fifth paw.
he's just mutilating other people's scripts and we lose money. And you, Allochka, keep in mind:
when I say something, you don't ask why, but take your pencil and write it down. Understood?
Yeah. That's good.
Yes, one more thing. I totally forgot. Yes, I'm listening.
take care of Rostrapovich.
3-d double of Vavilen Tatarsky appeared on screen for unaccountable number of times, but Tatarskiy himself, remembering those gone-by, as if in dream, days, like to rewatch just some clips.
there were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous." Passage from Psalm 14.
only few suspected this was Tatarskiy's advertising stunt for Pepsi-Cola, made up in accordance with his own advertising technology of WOWism.
american religious fundamentalists - coca-colists - stomps jars of Pepsi-Cola as symbol of liberalism.
with ruler's order...
everybody remembers appearance of Vavilen Tatarskiy in role of Stenkirazin in monumental commercial for Head & Shoulders.
when your head is taken away, you don't cry after your hair.
well known is commecial for Moscow shop-chain GAP where Tatarskiy was filmed togehter with his deputy Markovin.
Kandagar was bigger!
3-d double of Tatarsky participated in political life.
his appearance in funeral of political technologist Farsuk Karlovich Forseykin who was mysteriously strangled with skipping-ropes in Sandunovski bathohouses, is also known.
Tatarskiy's slogan for American Express is written in history: World is place where business meets money.
it is known that Tatarskiy's favorite job was advertisment for beer Tuborg. After watching it, as whispering told his secretary Alla, tears came to Tatarskiy's eyes.
the commercial itself didn't pass WOW-test, thus it was not aired even once.
stop! What's that with my eyes?
what is it? Those are sad eyes. Do something.
that's a different matter. And wider smile. More. Like that.
we are not advertising a product, but simple human happiness.
life is a lonely journey, under scorching sun and chilling cold.
how often the road we are going leads us nowhere! And it is unknown when death will meet us.
when you think about it, everything in the world seems empty and small.
then enlightenment kicks in: "Tuborg - be prepared for anything.
stay Frosty
copy, Seven Two. I copy all. Ready for remarks.
fuck!
sir?
what the fuck? - Jesus, Eric.
I thought that haji was killing you.
I fucked his shit up good, didn't I?
you stuck him in a magazine.
better luck next time, sir.
damn, sir. Your hamster must have fell off its wheel.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Hitman Two.
continue digging in. We're holding here while R. C.T. One advances. Over.
R. C.T. One is moving into Al Kut.
it's about time they carried their weight.
Kocher is on patrol in this zone.
do not engage on your left beyond eleven o'clock.
copy on all, Three Two. Godfather out.
I'm taking him to a field interrogation.
it's all good.
he's your capture.
shit, he'd probably fuck up the report.
mobile One One this is boom boom. You got wind of One Five.
Roger...
the officers are assembled. - Let's go right away.
as of 9:15 hours forward elements of Colonel Dowdy's regiment seized the main bridge over the Tigris river in Al Kut.
as you know, I just returned from a meeting with General Mattis.
what you don't know is that shortly after Dowdy led his regiment into Al Kut,
general Mattis relieved him of his command.
and gentlemen,
Colonel Dowdy was also relieved of the ammo for his sidearm.
Colonel Dowdy was a good man, but he did not fully embrace maneuver warfare.
and lest we forget, maneuver warfare is America's warfare for the 21st century.
it is all about the violence of action.
with first recon at the tip of the spear, 7, 000 Marines have just completed the corps' longest march since the barbary campaign against Tripoli in 1803.
actually, some of you are riding in the same Humvees they used.
through our use of maneuver, we have tied down many times our number of the enemy's force, opening the door for the army to invade the enemy capital from the west.
sir, does this mean it's the end of our mission?
unknown.
but the First Marine Division is positioning itself on the outskirts of Baghdad for the assault, and we will be there.
rest assured,
godfather will find a mission for this battalion.
but what I want to leave you with today is this:
Colonel Dowdy did succeed this morning.
he did lead his men into Al Kut.
but General Mattis has a long memory.
he did not forget that at critical moments
dowdy hesitated to execute orders.
and gentlemen,
Ferrando has a long memory too.
Gunny, that stuff about the General's memory and Dowdy being relieved, was Godfather talking about us in there?
I believe he meant, sir, that if you don't square away Nate Fick, you'll be in his sights.
Gunny, the men get those new M. R.Es?
they did. They're happy.
these are the new ones with milkshakes.
there's strawberry, chocolate and vanilla.
didn't you get Hasser's report on shooting that civilian?
we've got to take care of this asscovering bullshit.
it'll be good for Hasser too.
he does his duty, gets back to being a Marine.
Thanks, Mike. You're a fucking nag.
Hey, Walt.
feel the love.
baby. - Just leave me the fuck alone.
finally, he speaks.
I liked it better when we were starving.
then I didn't have to see shit all over your face.
want some?
finish your report and get it to me ASAP.
you did nothing wrong.
but we're gonna see if there's a better way to stop these cars.
Walt's got a great way, Lt.
shoot the driver, stop the car.
sir, it's vital.
Hasser will write his way clear, but we're fast becoming an army of occupation.
we can't just shoot these civilians like we're doing.
Marines aren't cops, Brad. We're an aggressive force.
that said, we'll see what we can do.
Hey, fuck it, Walt.
these haji motherfuckers are trying to kill us.
I'm for lighting up every motherfucker that comes within 100 m.
damn, man.
didn't we kick their asses already?
this is really interesting.
you know, Iraqis don't really seem good at fighting, but then they never really completely surrender either.
put down that fucking milkshake and dig a fucking hole.
why, so I can be more like the teacher's pet?
Yeah, that's exactly it.
you should be more like Trombley. - More like Trombley?
more like Trombley?!
Whopper Jr. - Give me the hook.
Whopper Jr.
anybody find that extra pin from the gypsy rack?
no, we still missing that?
that thing's gonna fucking fall off and we're gonna lose all our water cans.
maybe take an extra off and shove those down.
Brunmeier, drink the fucking water.
how are they doing? - Ass to mouth disease.
half the guys got the shits.
both right now? - Yeah, take 'em.
it's a good thing this is over.
fuck!
for us, anyway.
manimal just dropped a case of grenades.
see? That's why we can't have nice things.
fucking hick.
you wanted to see me, sir? - Nate, did you hear?
general Mattis shitcanned Colonel Dowdy.
he took the ammo from his sidearm, lieutenant.
Colonel wasn't a team player.
godfather said we should all play on the team.
if it can happen to a full bird Colonel, it can happen to anyone.
so you know, there will be no more questioning of my orders.
respectfully, sir, I've only tried to interpret your intent to the best of my ability.
captain, sir.
here comes the warrior on our team.
outstanding work last night taking down that E. P.W.
just doing my job. - Looks like he put up quite a fight.
a fight like that tells me the company took in a highvalue asset.
he did not want to surrender.
you have the afteraction report?
sergeant Kocher is bringing it.
while your platoon has been busy shooting civilians at roadblocks
Bravo Three was taking in live prisoners.
I heard.
good work, Dave.
anybody got any chow over there?
what do you want?
I'll take anything I can get at this point.
tell Victor Three to get on the road, we got C. A.O. checks.
this'll be handy if we write your platoon up for a commendation.
sergeant, your E. P.W. put up quite a struggle.
it's a good thing your C. O. was there.
if you want to believe what was the reason for this meeting?
right.
battalion says we're moving on.
that's ASAP, Lieutenant.
lieutenant, I was about to... - Yeah, but no.
not the right time.
why were they calling you Whopper Jr?
they were calling me that?
why were they calling him that?
Brad, we got foot mobiles. - Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we've got a bunch of foot mobiles at 11 o'clock.
Interrogative: do they have weapons?
hostile intent? - They got naked intent.
be advised, there's a minivan pulling off the road.
Roger.
be vigilant, over. - Trombley, range the Mark-19.
bad guys could be in that van.
stand by, Hitman Two.
Roger, standing by.
Walt, watch your fucking sector.
it looks like we caught these guys in the act, trying to change their uniforms.
two Actual, we ought to halt the convoy here.
Roger that, Two One.
they say they were robbed.
lying motherfuckers.
tell us where you hid your uniforms.
your documents.
they say there were robbed by the soldiers.
they stole their clothes and siphoned the gas from the car.
lieutenant Fick, sir!
over here!
be careful of the one on the right!
he's got a horse cock like Manimal's. You don't want to get that thing angry.
sir, we have three Arab males naked.
it appears they've been shot execution style.
H. M.C. Bryan investigating the cause of death has determined all three have been killed with gunshot wounds to the back of the head.
good work, Rudy.
team Two at your service, sir. - Team leader of the year, Rudy Reyes.
this ain't our work.
dudes are telling the truth.
he says they are farmers. One family brothers.
I don't think he's lying.
command Two, this is Two One Bravo.
I've got an english speaking haji in this minivan waving around his wife beater.
says they got jacked by some Iraqi soldiers.
americans, you win battle, beat Saddam's army.
now his army beat us. What you do?
they rob us.
what do you do?
listen, this is something you're gonna have to...
you have to take it up with the U. N.
okay?
just stay back from the road.
and you don't have to wave your T-shirts around anymore, all right?
here.
found a haji helmet.
fits good.
how do I look?
like a target.
it's better than nothing.
what we did, running and gunning through those towns, the good stuff and the bad was all part of the plan.
of all the Marines in the 1st division, the General selected us to be the instrument of long range strategy.
we led the feint to Al Kut.
we tied down two Iraqi divisions, saved untold numbers of U. S. soldiers.
you should be proud.
why didn't we go into Al Kut?
Gabe, the General's plan wasn't about taking the city.
it was about making the Iraqis think we were gonna take it.
to be clear, the Commander's intent was never to take it.
the focus has always been Baghdad.
this sucks, man.
we did all this shit because we took a wrong turn?
Gabe, that's not what I'm saying. - You got something better to do?
what the fuck is in your hand?
it's my new helmet, sir.
it's a haji gear I painted Marine camo.
I lost my kevlar in the run to the airfield, remember?
sergeant Major Sixta made me ditch the bike helmet.
how's your teams combat effectiveness?
well, we got Person's allergies, but none of my teams got the shits.
leon and Lilley both have it, but they're still doing their job, sir.
team Two is out.
three is almost as bad.
looks like we'll be nursing this platoon all the way into Baghdad.
my money is we won't be in the assault to Baghdad.
you don't use Humvees to attack an urban center.
you don't use Humvees to strong point a city either, but we did.
maybe they'll hook us up, sir, let us guard some of Saddam's money in one of those palaces.
I don't know.
I just hope we get to fuck up some more shit before the war ends.
they need to send our asses to Baghdad.
reyes, how many guys are sick on your team?
I have three men down, warrior healer.
that makes 14 in the platoon.
are you throwing up?
wake up, Budweiser.
Brunmeier, come on. Wake the fuck up.
I got the shits, doc.
I can't. - Drink some water, you fucking asshole.
what's this about a T72 tank on his side of the perimeter?
it's fucking blown, Gunny. - Reyes.
aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
what kind of team leader are you, not checking out an enemy tank on your perimeter?
Roger that, Gunny.
being I'm the only man on my team not down with the shits
I will take out a patrol.
no, you put the hammer to your team. Like Godfather says, malingering spreads like a yeast infection unless you nip it in the bud.
these men can't walk.
has our Lieutenant approved this order?
he has.
if the men are ill, then you should go with them, corpsman.
I love this guy.
and you'd better watch it, doc.
team Three will take it.
your men are sicker.
doesn't even have a turret.
fucking cocksucker sends us into a fucking swamp to check this weak shit out.
what the hell was that?
I shit my pants.
how are you showing yourself as team leader tonight?
tonight?
Yes, sir. - Where the hell is Lovell's team?
they're out there.
they're inspecting the T72. - A tank? Where?
in the swamp.
they blown out one.
gunnery Sergeant Griego informed us that you...
they're covering your ass, Nate.
what the fuck is going on here?
how would it look if that tank was operational?
I'll tell you what it looks like right now.
it resembles an incompetent moron climbing up the asshole of his company commander by inventing a bullshit mission.
did you seek my authority before tasking my platoon with this?
I did.
I woke you 40 minutes ago to affirm the order.
you woke me?
I hadn't been to sleep in 36 hours.
I have no recollection whatsoever of you waking me.
I thought I was dreaming.
get the fuck out of here.
and do not ever again mess with my platoon.
I was just trying to cover you.
you know you're suspect with battalion.
fuck that.
you can fuck with me all you want but do not,
I repeat, do not fuck with my men.
I'm putting it down, Gunny.
you picking it up?
Stiney, that's my front yard you just puked on there.
sorry.
clumps of them in 10s and 20s.
they're coming from as far as I can see.
quite a party you got going, Damon.
they started showing up at 00 dark 30.
the plan is for my platoon to escort these folks through our lines to the southern checkpoint.
need you to let them through in blocks of 40.
sir, if I may ask, why not send them back to Al Kut?
the fighting's over there. - These people aren't from Al Kut.
they say they're from Baghdad.
they walked over 100 miles?
look, we don't know who anyone is.
could be a suicide bomber among us, so stay frosty.
keep your vehicles at a walking pace and this is important keep a good distance from these people.
Roger.
white boys on my team celebrating the end of our war, sir.
35, 40 at a clip.
keep the families together.
Roger.
smith, bring them through in groups of 35.
keep the families together.
slow walk them.
stay hard.
slow walk them. Slow walking them.
this is Hitman Actual.
keep your eyes open. Watch their hands.
some of them might be armed.
kid, nice jacket.
take this group.
keep your fucking distance from them.
lilley, why don't you take up the rear?
Garza, come up here to the front.
all right?
let's roll. - Bravo, this is Two Two.
don't point weapons at these people, but keep your guns up.
Hitman Two Three, Hitman Two Two. Roger, copy that.
all right, we've got the left side on this one.
two Two, keep an eye on that group coming past your Humvee.
Where's my Trombley?
get these people some water.
not the ass water. Get the bottled.
two Two, keep that group tight. Keep a good pace.
carry that, miss? I got it.
yo, break out some M. R.Es.
like my nigga Tupac said, "it's hard times, man.
Yeah.
make me wanna holler.
word.
what are these?
sure. - Water! Water!
pass them around.
water! - Water water, me me!
keep moving.
easy, easy, easy.
thank you, soldier.
thank you for letting me pass on my own road in my own country.
excuse me, ma'am? - Why are you Americans here?
we want to help you, ma'am.
you know, I come from Baghdad.
it is a beautiful city and you are bombing it.
this is to make my life better?
Brad, we don't have to take this kind of guff.
I mean, we're liberating these ungrateful bitches.
you know, this is a very beautiful country.
and our president is very stupid.
maybe you are here for liberation, I don't know.
but because of oil, it feels like war of aggression.
ma'am, I think you got a really good point.
no, I really do.
really.
so much for death before dishonor.
damn, devil dog, for a piece of ass like that,
I'd sell your sister to Uday and Qusay.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two.
go on. Go.
don't give that thing to me.
Yeah, I understand. Ma'am, I understand.
here you go.
are you happy now?
man, like this I grow up.
come on.
here you go.
Mikey, give us a hand.
it's okay. Come on.
I got you.
here we go.
easy, easy, easy.
in you go. - That's enough.
no more. Truck's full.
all right, now.
we just turned this combat team into a hay ride.
Thanks.
Obrigado.
got to keep them cool.
doesn't matter what we do here. Quarter of these babies are gonna die.
you all right, Nathan?
yah, Gunny.
I'm good.
we're helping people.
this humanitarian stuff, we get lost in it, we're not combat effective.
this is our future here.
lieutenant, sir!
godfather's on the radio for you. Battalion wants us Oscar Mike.
Yeah, man. On it, thanks.
don't bravo it. Use the smoke first.
what the fuck? Shit!
his fucking head exploded!
guarantee he ain't getting up.
at least we gave him a happy meal before he died. No wait, check that.
before we hit him in the head with a fucking 40 Mike-Mike.
God damn!
how'd the fuck the hajis kill an M1A1?
not a mobility kill.
both tracks look okay.
think the Marines in there got out?
if not, they died fighting a legit enemy.
Jesus, dude. That was first marines.
they've got to be from oceanside.
Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.
the E. C.P. from the division camp is in Grid
over.
Roger,
I copy. Grid Papa Quebec 278394, over.
Hitman Two out.
Hey, those are dogs we ought to shoot.
if I felt we could spare the ammo, I'd give you the order.
Oh, fuck, man.
do not run that over, Ray.
Jesus.
you just can't fucking win.
man, they're prepping Baghdad hard.
and we're in a fucking pog camp.
it's over for us.
we won't be part of the show in Baghdad.
Yup.
this wasn't what we trained for.
I just wanted to get one real recon mission in this war.
you know?
putting us in these is an affront to my warrior spirit.
I'm a hunter, not a fucking truck driver corralling gun platforms.
Brad, we were the fucking first boots on the ground in the American invasion of Mesopotamia.
and you got your men out alive.
might be sad about not getting your mission but for me,
I got to tell you, I'm glad this is over.
one other thing, no more cat holes.
this fucking pog camp we're in has a legit slittrench latrine.
really.
that's my recon mission then.
two on comms.
... Hitman.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two Two...
over.
Manimal, you're no longer allowed to touch the handset again. Over.
I put my babies down.
think I'm gonna get some shuteye.
I want you to know you've done good, Tony.
you earned a lot of reputation in the recon community as my A. T.L.
you've always had my six.
I just want you to know I really appreciate that.
and it's been...
do you realize the shit that we've done here, the people we've killed?
back in the civilian world, dawg, if we did this, we would go to prison.
poke, you're thinking like a mexican again.
think like a white man.
over there, they'll be laying on the medals for what we did.
what's with you, dawg?
I'm tweaking, bro.
don't feel right unless I'm strapped.
I'm gonna go pull guard duty.
sir.
sergeant, they're speaking pretty highly of First Recon at division headquarters.
the General thinks we're slaying dragons.
I'm pleased to hear that, sir.
but between you and me, it's bullshit.
you men need another mission.
tanks are gonna lead the way into Baghdad, but we want to get in the game too.
Yes, sir.
be advised, Brad:
stay frosty.
I got her right in front of me! - Show me those titties!
come on, baby! I got 15 large! Give me one ass cheek!
a liberated bitch. - I'm gonna hit that shit.
wearing your desert goggles. That ain't nothing but a piece of nappy haired Whiskey Tango.
he's right, man. You ain't hittin' shit. W. M. like that?
no, she be wearing kevlar panties nailed on top of a concertina wire bush.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do a recon there.
I'm gonna make a path for all you motherfuckers.
shit, man, can you imagine the stank on that cunt?
that is exactly why I'm going!
sir, I'm gonna go down on her like she got all of Saddam's W. M.Ds just buried right between her legs.
you better dig deep. - Oh, Yeah, baby!
hit that gas, come on!
give it a little tap! Pat it, pat it!
it's not that bad over here. Don't kill yourself like that.
shit, go get it, baby. Get some for old J. C.
Oh, shit. Heads up. - Oh, shit, smash!
belays that, Devil Dog!
you's a squealin'
like a bunch of butt-fucked Vassar bitches!
unfuck yourselves or we gonna suffer the spectacle of a W. M.
with a bunch of horny Devil Dogs trailin' their stern.
get yourselves squared up here.
corporal, you're inappropriatin' your chemical filtration device by attemptin'
fornication wit' it!
Jesus, do I have to tell you not to desecrate your mask with perversions?
where the fuck are your helmets?
fuckin' Sixta.
no sooner do we stop getting shot at, the motherfucker is out here lifing us in his illiterate fucking retardese.
people think they have the authority to kill the minority, man.
fuck the police.
holy shit! - What the fuck?
what the fuck? Get some!
fuckin' Brad.
Yeah! Hell, yeah.
it don't get no better than that.
man over all stations, be advised: Sergeant Colbert is wings level.
can somebody clear him hot?
what, did you give him some Rolling Stone drugs or something?
no.
what the fuck did you do to him?
asked him what he would be if he wasn't Marine.
Oh my god, he wants to be a ballerina?
that's my fuckin' dream.
what the fuck?
you fucking rock.
better now.
ray, I want you to gather the team.
all right.
drop your pots, gents.
sergeant Colbert's giving you a pass.
there's something I've been keeping from you.
I wasn't sure we were gonna live to share this moment.
fuck yeah!
chef Boyardee, the master! - To celebrate.
here, hurry up! - Trombley, get a fire going.
Walt, here.
you deceiving, conniving, hebrew motherfucker.
how were you gonna keep this from your dearest pal Rayray?
I got one more secret to share.
Juggs! - No no! Wait! Not yet.
I need some time with this alone.
come on. Just give me one. - Just calm down.
you'll get your sloppy seconds with Jasmine.
you gotta share with Trombley.
what? He'll kill her!
eat, fuck, kill all the same, right?
Yeah! All the same if you're a fucking psycho.
I'm telling you, I fear for Jasmine. - Speaking of which, one of you guys still has my girlfriend's picture.
dude,
I hate to tell you this, but your girlfriend's is a kind of a whore.
what?
Yeah, last time I saw her, she was doing all of H&S company.
she doesn't deserve you, man.
brah, civilian food gives me the munchies!
Lilley. - Thanks, Brad.
Arbe are faroni?
what's your problem?
last time the white man gave my people something, it was blankets laced with typhoid.
poke, can't we all just...
get along?
Whopper Jr. you got any tabasco to go with this?
okay, there it is.
you did just call him Whopper Jr.
now what the hell is that about?
we call our man Whopper Jr. because they're sold at Burger King.
burger King.
right. B. K.
baby killer.
Trombley's our little Whopper Jr. ever since he shot those shepherds.
damn, Brad, what else you got hidden in the Humvee?
a fat chick?
shoot some civilians, you get a reputation. Right?
he didn't mean that.
you're a fuckin' messed up hick. You can't even eat ravioli.
I'm eating ravioli.
look at him!
gents, the final battle against Saddam's military began this morning when R. C.T-5 crossed the Diyala river.
the final assault of Baghdad is under way.
now, some of you may have surmised that this is not a game for marines in open Humvees, that while this great battle is being fought, you'd be sitting in a field holding your dicks.
or if you're in h&s company, holding our dicks.
this is a problem that's been gnawing at Godfather since Al Kut.
and the solution was right in front of me the whole time.
gentlemen, the northern flank.
above Baghdad, we assume a significant Republican guard presence, especially since it's this region that's the home to the Sunnis and Ba'athists.
now it turns out this had been weighing on the C. G.'s mind when I went to meet with him last night.
chaos has committed all three regiments to the assault from the east here.
there's a town called Baqubah about 50 kliks north of the city where an iraqi mechanized Republican guard division is unaccounted for.
okay? Now this leaves Chaos's northern flank as tender as the virgin's thigh.
until I met with him, the C. G. thought his only option was to peel off a mechanized battalion.
as a good officer should,
I gave him another option.
gentlemen, we are going to Baqubah.
expect morning orders within 30 mikes.
sir, there's a situation.
despite our best efforts, they came up on our comms this morning.
they know where we are and they're less than two kliks from our perimeter.
sir, we could give them a tangential mission, maybe task them with guarding H&S?
major, we can't unfuck this one.
gentlemen, one other thing:
delta company will be with us.
the reservists have arrived.
all right, that's it.
Lt, what's the date today?
copy that, Two Two. Solid copy.
yo, Dirty, you got a donkey dick?
radiator?
Yeah, wait a minute, Ray.
what the fuck are you doing?
writing in my journal.
about all this shit?
what, about you're singlehandedly winning this war?
that's the type of shit that Cody puts in his little diary.
look, if they say we fought valiantly here,
I want 'em to know we fought retarded.
Yeah, 'cause going into towns, storming an airfield with no observation.
I work for Captain America. You got fick at least.
I've been telling you, Eric, it don't have to be that way.
one bullet in the head, our whole platoon is squared away.
just stow that fuckin' shit.
you had your chances like everybody else and you haven't done it, so fuck you.
here comes dumbass.
well, guys, it's been groovy.
good work, men.
Yes, sir.
good.
good work.
each man sees things differently in combat.
right now at any time, we could die.
it's almost enough to make you lose your sanity.
to remain calm and stay in a place where you think you will die, that too is the definition of insane.
Nate, you have to become insane to survive in combat.
Yeah.
this is how it comes down to us.
we're on point for the battalion, but first we're linking up with war pig.
we're gonna be rolling with some real ass the fuckin' L. A.Vs.
and good news, bad news,
they're giving us the L. A.Vs because they're sending us north of Baghdad, where all Saddam's people are from.
and they don't love us up there like they do down south.
so fuck 'em where they live. - Damn right.
we'll be surrounded by friendlies until here...
the magic line.
no american unit has gone past this line.
a couple tried yesterday and got ambushed.
this...
is badguy country.
all l right, gents, we got 30 mikes.
somebody's got to win this.
what the fuck are you all moto about?
jumpin' jehoshaphat.
are we that desperate for cannon fodder that they're clearing out the sick, - the lame, the crazy? - Look at you boys?
at what's up with these guys?
what's up, Dawg? - Look at these guys.
how the fuck did you find us? - I came up with Delta.
shit, the fuckin' reservists, dude?
Brad, you're not gonna believe it. It has been madness since day one.
what happened to your cushy liaison gig at Al Jabar?
Yeah, rockin' the fucking side pipe with them air force hotties.
fuck that, I ain't had a war since Somalia I had to get some.
but I seriously would not have jumped ship if it meant rolling with Delta.
what?
Clusterfuck? - They're off the hook.
dude, they don't got any gear or food.
they were pulling escort duty just to eat.
and then they got to rollin' into these hamlets and doing these shows of force you know, cowboy shit for fun. Like this one time, I swear to god, they thought it'd be funny to give these little kids, like, porn mags like Hustler and Maxim and shit, show the little hajis what we're fighting for.
this old Iraqi comes storming out, starts screaming at our interpreter about how we're fucking up their morals or some dumb shit, right?
and he's super fucking pissed. The old man's got an R. P.G.
what?
delta fuckin' freaks. They lob like 26 mark-19 rounds.
they fuck up the whole hamlet.
fuck. - Bull-fucking-shit.
Ollie North filmed the whole fucking thing.
the Oliver North?
Oliver fuckin' North was standing there with a camera crew from Fox filming the whole thing like it was the turning point in the fucking war.
these delta fucks are like L. A.P. D. cops and D. E.A. agents and fucking air marshals.
you know what I mean?
and they're led by this Napoleon douche who is like a Corporal or some shit in Albuquerque P. D. I swear to god, this motherfucker has got cattle horns - on his Humvee. - This is so colossally retarded, - I can't even say anything about it. - Godfather knows.
he's been ducking us on the comms for the past couple weeks.
but they're here now, brad, and they're rolling with you.
no fuckin' way. We're working with reservists?
that's some bullshit.
look at this motherfucker.
check it out. If I'm lying, I'm dying.
that's a real marine.
we're out of our M. O.P. P.S.
right now. - Yes, sir.
you can actually see it rolling downhill.
Yep, here it comes.
change in S. O.P.
out of our M. O.P. P. suits. You've 5 min to get right, then we're red-con one.
we're back in cammies! - So fresh and so clean.
fuck, I don't have bootpants.
my balls smell like Jack's mouth.
how do you know what his mouth smells like?
cause my balls were in it.
what the fuck do they do over there, man?
no, really, if we're not in our M. O.P. P. suits, that means there's no W. M.Ds
if there's no W. M.D. S, then why are we here in the first place?
I knew you were a fucking gay-ass liberal.
you tried to pretend by invading iraq with us, but I knew.
I'm serious, Ray. Isn't that the whole point of us being here?
the point is we get to kill people, you dumb fuck.
what's the difference anyway, man?
I mean, the war's almost over.
we're just about done with this bitch.
shit, man, they're taking everything.
Yeah, they're pretty much liberated around here.
ray, stay focused.
we have a mission. - Yeah, some mission...
cross the magic line.
what the fuck can that be all about?
that's us. War pig, then recon.
the line is on 34 northern.
on the other side? The Iraqis.
and they're mechanized.
focus, Ray.
focus.
watch for mines, Ray.
remember, this is bad-guy country.
reporter, do you know what you're supposed to do if the Humvee gets hit by a mine? You're supposed to curl up like a bitch.
Trombley, make nice. - You know how to curl up like a bitch, don't you, reporter?
what is believed to be the final assault on the city's defenders.
and now for cricket...
bbc says they're puttin' whoop-ass on Baghdad.
and we're out here in the fucking sticks.
man, turn that shit off.
... disappointing results, "but," he said, "there's always a next time.
we're out here under the radar where nobody knows we're here.
hopefully, it'll fuckin' stay that way.
once more into the great good night.
cry havoc "and let slip the dogs of war.
man, when I get home, I am gonna eat the fuck out of my girlfriend's pussy.
is that Shakespeare?
Shakespeare wrote that?
about his girlfriend's pussy?
godfather, Godfather.
I take it the L. A.Vs in front of us just crossedthe magic line.
the L. A.Vs report enemy contact on both sides of the road.
rockets, mortars and machine guns.
Hitman, Hitman, small arms fire to our three o'clock, 250 meters out.
I have no targets.
no targets.
Walt, what are you shooting at?
I got muzzle flashes behind those walls.
hold on, buddy! That's a fuckin'village over there.
I see fuckin' fire coming in. - Not from the houses!
there are people in that village.
all Hitman Two... - They ain't shooting at us.
... one-six north on route green. Break.
they've made contact with a squad-sized force. Over.
Roger.
halt the vehicle. - All right.
l. A.Vs have stopped.
enemy! Enemy, both sides! Break!
my God. Is he crying?
no, he's not.
he's just nervous.
we're gonna die if they don't get us out of here!
they sent us to die!
okay, fuck it. He's crying.
all Hitman Victors, this is Hitman Two.
be advised, the L. A.Vs are egressing to the south. Break.
we pull back into a defensive position and dropping mortars. Over.
that's a solid copy.
Trombley, the L. A.Vs will be coming up on our left.
do not engage.
if you do, they'll schwack us.
Jesus Christ.
tracers skipping around us.
that's our own guys, shooting down the axis of our convoy.
all Hitman Two Victors, hold your fire...
fucking reservists.
hold, Delta. Over.
is that the reservists firing on the ville?
Walt! - It's Delta.
they're laying down F. P.F. on the village.
it's all fucked up. - Get those guys on the net.
man, they got passed down. We have no comms with Delta.
I don't know, maybe the fucking retards will just run out of ammo.
God damn, this is gonna be a long night.
this is Assassin One. We are set.
assassin One, this is Assassin Two...
assassin One Two, this is Assassin One Three, we have local enemy entrenched 400 meters to the north. Break.
possible enemy mortar position.
north 1, 000 meters. Interrogative. - Stay in line!
are you in the position to observe and persecute the target?
assassin One Three, this is Assassin One Two.
we are static.
stand by while I roll the Godfather back.
assassin One Two out. Break break.
they all got blankets on to hide their heat signatures, right, Sergeant Colbert?
a week ago, they didn't know we could see their thermals at night.
now they're adapting.
didn't work for that guy.
get down! - No!
cease fire!
cease fucking fire, Sergeant!
sergeant!
cease fire, motherfucker! - Cease fire!
cease fire now!
cease fucking fire!
sergeant! What the fuck?
my staff Sergeant told me to engage all movement.
what are you doing? You dumb motherfucker, you realize you're shooting at Marines?
I saw an Iraqi helmet.
I got this, Corporal.
fuck.
two Actual, this is Two One.
who the fuck is shooting at us?
fuckin' L. A.P. D. cops from Delta!
they fucking love shooting Mexicans.
it was Alpha, Gabe.
alpha.
mistakes happen.
two One Actual, what's your status?
everyone likes to shoot Mexicans, even Mexicans.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
this is accurate mortar fire. Request permission to egress.
negative. Our orders are to hold our position.
we're blocking for Alpha. Over.
there's a fuckin' braindead idea. - That's a hold.
we're covering Alpha's assault.
check out the retard cas-evacing lamb chops.
man, that's fucking intense when you think about it, homes.
here's this poor farmer who's out there...
shut the fuck up.
fucking fish in a barrel.
same motherfuckers who tried to smoke your ass.
... the most dramatic pictures are showing
american Marines in Baghdad city center pulling down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein.
fighting seems to have come to an end...
turn that shit off. - All right, fine.
apparently, these motherfuckers up here don't listen to the BBC.
no talking, no radio. Jeez, Brad.
grab the mag.
how about this guy over here? - No, man, over here, J. J.
Bobby, use my camera too, man. - Damn!
fucking reservists, man. - Just take the fucking photo.
be careful, Dan. R. P.G. could be mined.
don't pick shit up till you check it.
copy that.
get up. Get the fuck up. - No no no.
come on. - Okay.
okay, okay. - Now.
got you covered, Eric.
hands.
come on.
hands.
thank you.
you saved our asses. It's the 1st real fighting we've seen.
you move and I'll blow your head off. - I have a family!
we ought to cut his throat like in the Chechen soldier video?
captain, sir... sir, what are you...
sir. Intimidation tactic.
sir, we got this situation under control.
fuck! Fuck! - Bombs!
we got a live one, men!
cover him, Redman.
you motherfuckers.
I'm sorry I shook your hand. You abused that prisoner.
Bravo Two, stay on line.
hold your fire. - No Saddam.
come.
looks like you won some hearts and minds, sir.
and some tongue.
check it out! We got their colors!
Yeah!
I love killing people!
please, I'm a very low soldier. - Fuck that.
you were waiting to kill us.
you didn't put your weapon down.
I'm afraid if we put our weapons down, the police will come and beat us.
everybody under Saddam is silent.
if he say we go to war with America, we say "good."
if he say we don't go to war with America, we say "good."
shit yeah.
we can't drop our weapons either. - We got orders.
next stop is Baghdad. - Sweet, man.
I don't want any war crimes in the back of my truck. Untie his hands.
give him some water.
you letting me go?
how can I go home?
my sergeant, he sees me, - he find out I didn't fight. - Negro, ain't no Saddam.
know what I mean? Ain't no Iraqi army.
you ain't got a sergeant no more.
either we killed his ass already or shit he be running away faster than you.
feelin' me?
you're going to Baghdad, my friend.
we got a prisoner collection center there.
Baghdad?
for free?
I'm so happy. Thank you, thank you. I'm so happy.
it's all good, playboy.
thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you.
contact, two kliks!
what the fuck, man?
don't these fucking guys know that we won the war already?
we got ambushed all the way up here.
there still could be some bad guys who want to play.
God damn it, Ray.
no country music.
okay?
dude, it's not a country song, it's a cowboy song.
I hate to break it to you, Ray, but there are no cowboys.
sir?
what the fuck? - Jesus, Eric.
I thought that haji was killing you.
I fucked his shit up good, didn't I?
you stuck him in a magazine.
better luck next time, sir.
damn, sir. Your hamster must have fell off its wheel.
all Hitman Two Victors, this is Hitman Two.
continue digging in. We're holding here while R. C.T. One advances. Over.
R. C.T. One is moving into Al Kut.
it's about time they carried their weight.
Kocher is on patrol in this zone.
do not engage on your left beyond eleven o'clock.
copy on all, Three Two. Godfather out.
I'm taking him to a field interrogation.
it's all good.
he's your capture.
shit, he'd probably fuck up the report.
mobile One One this is boom boom. You got wind of One Five.
Roger...
the officers are assembled. - Let's go right away.
as of 0915 hours forward elements of Colonel Dowdy's regiment seized the main bridge over the Tigris river in Al Kut.
as you know, I just returned from a meeting with General Mattis.
what you don't know is that shortly after Dowdy led his regiment into Al Kut,
general Mattis relieved him of his command.
and gentlemen,
Colonel Dowdy was also relieved of the ammo for his sidearm.
Colonel Dowdy was a good man, but he did not fully embrace maneuver warfare.
and lest we forget, maneuver warfare is America's warfare for the 21st century.
it is all about the violence of action.
with first recon at the tip of the spear, 7, 000 Marines have just completed the corps' longest march since the barbary campaign against Tripoli in 1803.
actually, some of you are riding in the same Humvees they used.
through our use of maneuver, we have tied down many times our number of the enemy's force, opening the door for the army to invade the enemy capital from the west.
sir, does this mean it's the end of our mission?
unknown.
but the First Marine Division is positioning itself on the outskirts of Baghdad for the assault, and we will be there.
rest assured,
godfather will find a mission for this battalion.
but what I want to leave you with today is this:
Colonel Dowdy did succeed this morning.
he did lead his men into Al Kut.
but General Mattis has a long memory.
he did not forget that at critical moments
dowdy hesitated to execute orders.
and gentlemen, has a long memory too.
that stuff about the General's memory and Dowdy being relieved, was Godfather talking about us in there?
I believe he meant, sir, that if you don't square away Nate Fick, you'll be in his sights.
the men get those new M. R.Es?
they did. They're happy.
these are the new ones with milkshakes.
there's strawberry, chocolate and vanilla.
didn't you get Hasser's report on shooting that civilian?
we've got to take care of this asscovering bullshit.
it'll be good for Hasser too.
he does his duty, gets back to being a Marine.
Thanks, Mike. You're a fucking nag.
Hey, Walt.
feel the love.
baby. - Just leave me the fuck alone.
finally, he speaks.
I liked it better when we were starving.
then I didn't have to see shit all over your face.
want some?
finish your report and get it to me ASAP.
you did nothing wrong.
but we're gonna see if there's a better way to stop these cars.
Walt's got a great way, Lt.
shoot the driver, stop the car.
sir, it's vital.
Hasser will write his way clear, but we're fast becoming an army of occupation.
we can't just shoot these civilians like we're doing.
Marines aren't cops, Brad. We're an aggressive force.
that said, we'll see what we can do.
Hey, fuck it, Walt.
these haji motherfuckers are trying to kill us.
I'm for lighting up every motherfucker that comes within 100 m.
damn, man.
didn't we kick their asses already?
this is really interesting.
you know, Iraqis don't really seem good at fighting, but then they never really completely surrender either.
put down that fucking milkshake and dig a fucking hole.
why, so I can be more like the teacher's pet?
Yeah, that's exactly it.
you should be more like Trombley. - More like Trombley?
more like Trombley?!
Whopper Jr. - Give me the hook.
anybody find that extra pin from the gypsy rack?
no, we still missing that?
that thing's gonna fucking fall off and we're gonna lose all our water cans.
maybe take an extra off and shove those down.
Brunmeier, drink the fucking water.
how are they doing? - Ass to mouth disease.
half the guys got the shits.
both right now? - Yeah, take 'em.
it's a good thing this is over.
fuck!
for us, anyway.
manimal just dropped a case of grenades.
see? That's why we can't have nice things.
fucking hick.
you wanted to see me, sir? - Nate, did you hear?
general Mattis shitcanned Colonel Dowdy.
he took the ammo from his sidearm, lieutenant.
Colonel wasn't a team player.
godfather said we should all play on the team.
if it can happen to a full bird Colonel, it can happen to anyone.
so you know, there will be no more questioning of my orders.
respectfully, sir, I've only tried to interpret your intent to the best of my ability.
captain, sir.
here comes the warrior on our team.
outstanding work last night taking down that E. P.W.
just doing my job. - Looks like he put up quite a fight.
a fight like that tells me the company took in a highvalue asset.
he did not want to surrender.
you have the afteraction report?
sergeant Kocher is bringing it.
while your platoon has been busy shooting civilians at roadblocks
Bravo Three was taking in live prisoners.
I heard.
good work, Dave.
anybody got any chow over there?
what do you want?
I'll take anything I can get at this point.
tell Victor Three to get on the road, we got C. A.O. checks.
this'll be handy if we write your platoon up for a commendation.
sergeant, your E. P.W. put up quite a struggle.
it's a good thing your C. O. was there.
if you want to believe what was the reason for this meeting?
right.
battalion says we're moving on.
that's ASAP, Lieutenant.
lieutenant, I was about to... - Yeah, but no.
not the right time.
why were they calling you Whopper Jr?
they were calling me that?
why were they calling him that?
Brad, we got foot mobiles. - Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we've got a bunch of foot mobiles at 11 o'clock.
Interrogative: do they have weapons?
hostile intent? - They got naked intent.
be advised, there's a minivan pulling off the road.
Roger.
be vigilant, over. - Trombley, range the Mark-19.
bad guys could be in that van.
stand by, Hitman Two.
Roger, standing by.
Walt, watch your fucking sector.
it looks like we caught these guys in the act, trying to change their uniforms.
two Actual, we ought to halt the convoy here.
Roger that, Two One.
they say they were robbed.
lying motherfuckers.
tell us where you hid your uniforms.
your documents.
they say there were robbed by the soldiers.
they stole their clothes and siphoned the gas from the car.
lieutenant Fick, sir!
over here!
be careful of the one on the right!
he's got a horse cock like Manimal's. You don't want to get that thing angry.
sir, we have three Arab males naked.
it appears they've been shot execution style.
H. M.C. Bryan investigating the cause of death has determined all three have been killed with gunshot wounds to the back of the head.
good work, Rudy.
team Two at your service, sir. - Team leader of the year, Rudy Reyes.
this ain't our work.
dudes are telling the truth.
he says they are farmers. One family brothers.
I don't think he's lying.
command Two, this is Two One Bravo.
I've got an english speaking haji in this minivan waving around his wife beater.
says they got jacked by some Iraqi soldiers.
americans, you win battle, beat Saddam's army.
now his army beat us. What you do?
they rob us.
what do you do?
listen, this is something you're gonna have to...
you have to take it up with the U. N.
stay back from the road.
and you don't have to wave your T-shirts around anymore, all right?
here.
found a haji helmet.
fits good.
how do I look?
like a target.
it's better than nothing.
what we did, running and gunning through those towns, the good stuff and the bad was all part of the plan.
of all the Marines in the 1st division, the General selected us to be the instrument of long range strategy.
we led the feint to Al Kut.
we tied down two Iraqi divisions, saved untold numbers of U. S. soldiers.
you should be proud.
why didn't we go into Al Kut?
Gabe, the General's plan wasn't about taking the city.
it was about making the Iraqis think we were gonna take it.
to be clear, the Commander's intent was never to take it.
the focus has always been Baghdad.
this sucks, man.
we did all this shit because we took a wrong turn?
Gabe, that's not what I'm saying. - You got something better to do?
what the fuck is in your hand?
it's my new helmet, sir.
it's a haji gear I painted Marine camo.
I lost my kevlar in the run to the airfield, remember?
sergeant Major Sixta made me ditch the bike helmet.
how's your teams combat effectiveness?
well, we got Person's allergies, but none of my teams got the shits.
leon and Lilley both have it, but they're still doing their job, sir.
team Two is out.
three is almost as bad.
looks like we'll be nursing this platoon all the way into Baghdad.
my money is we won't be in the assault to Baghdad.
you don't use Humvees to attack an urban center.
you don't use Humvees to strong point a city either, but we did.
maybe they'll hook us up, sir, let us guard some of Saddam's money in one of those palaces.
I don't know.
I just hope we get to fuck up some more shit before the war ends.
they need to send our asses to Baghdad.
reyes, how many guys are sick on your team?
I have three men down, warrior healer.
that makes 14 in the platoon.
are you throwing up?
wake up, Budweiser.
Brunmeier, come on. Wake the fuck up.
I got the shits, doc.
I can't. - Drink some water, you fucking asshole.
what's this about a T72 tank on his side of the perimeter?
it's fucking blown, Gunny. - Reyes.
aye, Gunnery Sergeant.
what kind of team leader are you, not checking out an enemy tank on your perimeter?
Roger that, Gunny.
being I'm the only man on my team not down with the shits
I will take out a patrol.
no, you put the hammer to your team. Like Godfather says, malingering spreads like a yeast infection unless you nip it in the bud.
these men can't walk.
has our Lieutenant approved this order?
he has.
if the men are ill, then you should go with them, corpsman.
I love this guy.
and you'd better watch it, doc.
team Three will take it.
your men are sicker.
doesn't even have a turret.
fucking cocksucker sends us into a fucking swamp to check this weak shit out.
what the hell was that?
I shit my pants.
how are you showing yourself as team leader tonight?
tonight?
Yes, sir. - Where the hell is Lovell's team?
they're out there.
they're inspecting the T72. - A tank? Where?
in the swamp.
they blown out one.
gunnery Sergeant Griego informed us that you...
they're covering your ass, Nate.
what the fuck is going on here?
how would it look if that tank was operational?
I'll tell you what it looks like right now.
it resembles an incompetent moron climbing up the asshole of his company commander by inventing a bullshit mission.
did you seek my authority before tasking my platoon with this?
I did.
I woke you 40 mikes ago to affirm the order.
you woke me?
I hadn't been to sleep in 36 hours.
I have no recollection whatsoever of you waking me.
I thought I was dreaming.
get the fuck out of here.
and do not ever again mess with my platoon.
I was just trying to cover you.
you know you're suspect with battalion.
fuck that.
you can fuck with me all you want but do not,
I repeat, do not fuck with my men.
I'm putting it down, Gunny.
you picking it up?
Stiney, that's my front yard you just puked on there.
sorry.
clumps of them in 10s and 20s.
they're coming from as far as I can see.
quite a party you got going, Damon.
they started showing up at 00 dark 30.
the plan is for my platoon to escort these folks through our lines to the southern checkpoint.
need you to let them through in blocks of 40.
sir, if I may ask, why not send them back to Al Kut?
the fighting's over there. - These people aren't from Al Kut.
they say they're from Baghdad.
they walked over 100 miles?
look, we don't know who anyone is.
could be a suicide bomber among us, so stay frosty.
keep your vehicles at a walking pace and this is important keep a good distance from these people.
Roger.
white boys on my team celebrating the end of our war, sir.
35, 40 at a clip.
keep the families together.
Roger.
smith, bring them through in groups of 35.
keep the families together.
slow walk them.
stay hard.
slow walk them. Slow walking them.
this is Hitman Actual.
keep your eyes open. Watch their hands.
some of them might be armed.
kid, nice jacket.
take this group.
keep your fucking distance from them.
lilley, why don't you take up the rear?
Garza, come up here to the front.
all right?
let's roll. - Bravo, this is Two Two.
don't point weapons at these people, but keep your guns up.
Hitman Two Three, Hitman Two Two. Roger, copy that.
all right, we've got the left side on this one.
two Two, keep an eye on that group coming past your Humvee.
Where's my Trombley?
get these people some water.
not the ass water. Get the bottled.
two Two, keep that group tight. Keep a good pace.
carry that, miss? I got it.
yo, break out some M. R.Es.
like my nigga Tupac said, "it's hard times, man."
Yeah.
make me wanna holler.
word.
what are these?
sure. - Water! Water!
pass them around.
water! - Water water, me me!
keep moving.
easy, easy, easy.
thank you, soldier.
thank you for letting me pass on my own road in my own country.
excuse me, ma'am? - Why are you Americans here?
we want to help you, ma'am.
you know, I come from Baghdad.
it is a beautiful city and you are bombing it.
this is to make my life better?
Brad, we don't have to take this kind of guff.
I mean, we're liberating these ungrateful bitches.
you know, this is a very beautiful country.
and our president is very stupid.
maybe you are here for liberation, I don't know.
but because of oil, it feels like war of aggression.
ma'am, I think you got a really good point.
no, I really do.
really.
so much for death before dishonor.
damn, devil dog, for a piece of ass like that,
I'd sell your sister to Uday and Qusay.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two.
go on. Go.
don't give that thing to me.
Yeah, I understand. Ma'am, I understand.
here you go.
are you happy now?
man, like this I grow up.
come on.
here you go.
Mikey, give us a hand.
it's okay. Come on.
I got you.
here we go.
easy, easy, easy.
in you go. - That's enough.
no more. Truck's full.
all right, now.
we just turned this combat team into a hay ride.
Thanks.
Obrigado.
got to keep them cool.
doesn't matter what we do here. Quarter of these babies are gonna die.
you all right, Nathan?
yah, Gunny.
I'm good.
we're helping people.
this humanitarian stuff, we get lost in it, we're not combat effective.
this is our future here.
lieutenant, sir!
godfather's on the radio for you. Battalion wants us Oscar Mike.
Yeah, man. On it, thanks.
don't bravo it. Use the smoke first.
what the fuck? Shit!
his fucking head exploded!
guarantee he ain't getting up.
at least we gave him a happy meal before he died. No wait, check that.
before we hit him in the head with a fucking 40 Mike-Mike.
God damn!
how'd the fuck the hajis kill an M1A1?
not a mobility kill.
both tracks look okay.
think the Marines in there got out?
if not, they died fighting a legit enemy.
Jesus, dude. That was first marines.
they've got to be from oceanside.
Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.
the E. C.P. from the division camp is in Grid
over.
Roger,
I copy. Grid Papa Quebec 278394, over.
Hitman Two out.
Hey, those are dogs we ought to shoot.
if I felt we could spare the ammo, I'd give you the order.
Oh, fuck, man.
do not run that over, Ray.
Jesus.
you just can't fucking win.
man, they're prepping Baghdad hard.
and we're in a fucking pog camp.
it's over for us.
we won't be part of the show in Baghdad.
Yup.
this wasn't what we trained for.
I just wanted to get one real recon mission in this war.
you know?
putting us in these is an affront to my warrior spirit.
I'm a hunter, not a fucking truck driver corralling gun platforms.
Brad, we were the fucking first boots on the ground in the American invasion of Mesopotamia.
and you got your men out alive.
might be sad about not getting your mission but for me,
I got to tell you, I'm glad this is over.
one other thing, no more cat holes.
this fucking pog camp we're in has a legit slittrench latrine.
really.
that's my recon mission then.
... Hitman.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two Two...
over.
Manimal, you're no longer allowed to touch the handset again. Over.
I put my babies down.
think I'm gonna get some shuteye.
I want you to know you've done good, Tony.
you earned a lot of reputation in the recon community as my A. T.L.
you've always had my six.
I just want you to know I really appreciate that.
and it's been...
do you realize the shit that we've done here, the people we've killed?
back in the civilian world, dawg, if we did this, we would go to prison.
poke, you're thinking like a mexican again.
think like a white man.
over there, they'll be laying on the medals for what we did.
what's with you, dawg?
I'm tweaking, bro.
don't feel right unless I'm strapped.
I'm gonna go pull guard duty.
sir.
sergeant, they're speaking pretty highly of First Recon at division headquarters.
the General thinks we're slaying dragons.
I'm pleased to hear that, sir.
but between you and me, it's bullshit.
you men need another mission.
tanks are gonna lead the way into Baghdad, but we want to get in the game too.
Yes, sir.
be advised, Brad:
stay frosty.
I got her right in front of me! - Show me those titties!
come on, baby! I got 15 large! Give me one ass cheek!
a liberated bitch. - I'm gonna hit that shit.
wearing your desert goggles. That ain't nothing but a piece of nappy haired Whiskey Tango.
he's right, man. You ain't hittin' shit. W. M. like that?
no, she be wearing kevlar panties nailed on top of a concertina wire bush.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do a recon there.
I'm gonna make a path for all you motherfuckers.
shit, man, can you imagine the stank on that cunt?
that is exactly why I'm going!
sir, I'm gonna go down on her like she got all of Saddam's W. M.Ds just buried right between her legs.
you better dig deep. - Oh, Yeah, baby!
hit that gas, come on!
give it a little tap! Pat it, pat it!
it's not that bad over here. Don't kill yourself like that.
shit, go get it, baby. Get some for old J. C.
Oh, shit. Heads up. - Oh, shit, smash!
belays that, Devil Dog!
you's a squealin'
like a bunch of butt-fucked Vassar bitches!
unfuck yourselves or we gonna suffer the spectacle of a W. M.
with a bunch of horny Devil Dogs trailin' their stern.
get yourselves squared up here.
corporal, you're inappropriatin' your chemical filtration device by attemptin'
fornication wit' it!
Jesus, do I have to tell you not to desecrate your mask with perversions?
where the fuck are your helmets?
fuckin' Sixta.
no sooner do we stop getting shot at, the motherfucker is out here lifing us in his illiterate fucking retardese.
people think they have the authority to kill the minority, man.
fuck the police.
holy shit! - What the fuck?
what the fuck? Get some!
fuckin' Brad.
it don't get no better than that.
man over all stations, be advised: Sergeant Colbert is...
wings level.
can somebody clear him hot?
what, did you give him some Rolling Stone drugs or something?
no.
what the fuck did you do to him?
asked him what he would be if he wasn't Marine.
Oh my god, he wants to be a ballerina?
that's my fuckin' dream.
what the fuck?
you fucking rock.
better now.
ray, I want you to gather the team.
all right.
drop your pots, gents.
sergeant Colbert's giving you a pass.
there's something I've been keeping from you.
I wasn't sure we were gonna live to share this moment.
chef Boyardee, the master! - To celebrate.
here, hurry up! - Trombley, get a fire going.
Walt, here.
you deceiving, conniving, hebrew motherfucker.
how were you gonna keep this from your dearest pal Rayray?
I got one more secret to share.
Juggs! - No no! Wait! Not yet.
I need some I need some time with this alone.
come on. Just give me one. - Just calm down.
you'll get your sloppy seconds with Jasmine.
you gotta share with Trombley.
what? He'll kill her!
eat, fuck, kill all the same, right?
Yeah! All the same if you're a fucking psycho.
I'm telling you, I fear for Jasmine. - Speaking of which, one of you guys still has my girlfriend's picture.
I hate to tell you this, but your girlfriend's is a kind of a whore.
what?
Yeah, last time I saw her, she was doing all of H&S company.
she doesn't deserve you, man.
brah, civilian food gives me the munchies!
Lilley. - Thanks, Brad.
Arbe are faroni?
what's your problem?
last time the white man gave my people something, it was blankets laced with typhoid.
poke, can't we all just...
get along?
you got any tabasco to go with this?
okay, there it is.
you did just call him Whopper Jr.
now what the hell is that about?
we call our man Whopper Jr. because they're sold at Burger King.
right. B. K.
baby killer.
Trombley's our little Whopper Jr. ever since he shot those shepherds.
damn, Brad, what else you got hidden in the Humvee?
a fat chick?
shoot some civilians, you get a reputation. Right?
he didn't mean that.
you're a fuckin' messed up hick. You can't even eat ravioli.
I'm eating ravioli.
look at him!
gents, the final battle against Saddam's military began this morning when R. C.T-5 crossed the Diyala river.
the final assault of Baghdad is under way.
now, some of you may have surmised that this is not a game for marines in open Humvees, that while this great battle is being fought, you'd be sitting in a field holding your dicks.
or if you're in h&s company, holding our dicks.
this is a problem that's been gnawing at Godfather since Al Kut.
and the solution was right in front of me the whole time.
gentlemen, the northern flank.
above Baghdad, we assume a significant Republican guard presence, especially since it's this region that's the home to the Sunnis and Ba'athists.
now it turns out this had been weighing on the C. G.'s mind when I went to meet with him last night.
chaos has committed all three regiments to the assault from the east here.
there's a town called Baqubah about 50 kliks north of the city where an iraqi mechanized Republican guard division is unaccounted for.
okay? Now this leaves Chaos's northern flank as tender as the virgin's thigh.
until I met with him, the C. G. thought his only option was to peel off a mechanized battalion.
as a good officer should,
I gave him another option.
gentlemen, we are going to Baqubah.
expect morning orders within 30 mikes.
sir, there's a situation.
despite our best efforts, they came up on our comms this morning.
they know where we are and they're less than two kliks from our perimeter.
sir, we could give them a tangential mission, maybe task them with guarding H&S?
major, we can't unfuck this one.
gentlemen, one other thing:
delta company will be with us.
the reservists have arrived.
all right, that's it.
Lt, what's the date today?
copy that, Two Two. Solid copy.
you got a donkey dick?
radiator?
Yeah, wait a minute, Ray.
what the fuck are you doing?
writing in my journal.
about all this shit?
what, about you're singlehandedly winning this war?
that's the type of shit that Cody puts in his little diary.
look, if they say we fought valiantly here,
I want 'em to know we fought retarded.
Yeah, 'cause going into towns, storming an airfield with no observation.
I work for Captain America. You got fick at least.
I've been telling you, Eric, it don't have to be that way.
one bullet in the head, our whole platoon is squared away.
just stow that fuckin' shit.
you had your chances like everybody else and you haven't done it, so fuck you.
here comes dumbass.
well, guys, it's been groovy.
good work, men.
Yes, sir.
good.
good work.
each man sees things differently in combat.
right now at any time, we could die.
it's almost enough to make you lose your sanity.
to remain calm and stay in a place where you think you will die, that too is the definition of insane.
Nate, you have to become insane to survive in combat.
Yeah.
this is how it comes down to us.
we're on point for the battalion, but first we're linking up with war pig.
we're gonna be rolling with some real ass the fuckin' L. A.Vs.
and good newsbad news,
they're giving us the L. A.Vs because they're sending us north of Baghdad, where all Saddam's people are from.
and they don't love us up there like they do down south.
so fuck 'em where they live. - Damn right.
we'll be surrounded by friendlies until here...
the magic line.
no american unit has gone past this line.
a couple tried yesterday and got ambushed.
this...
is badguy country.
all l right, gents, we got 30 mikes.
somebody's got to win this.
what the fuck are you all moto about?
jumpin' jehoshaphat.
are we that desperate for cannon fodder that they're clearing out the sick, - the lame, the crazy? - Look at you boys?
at what's up with these guys?
what's up, Dawg? - Look at these guys.
how the fuck did you find us? - I came up with Delta.
shit, the fuckin' reservists, dude?
Brad, you're not gonna believe it. It has been madness since day one.
what happened to your cushy liaison gig at Al Jabar?
Yeah, rockin' the fucking side pipe with them air force hotties.
fuck that, I ain't had a war since Somalia I had to get some.
but I seriously would not have jumped ship if it meant rolling with Delta.
what?
Clusterfuck? - They're off the hook.
dude, they don't got any gear or food.
they were pulling escort duty just to eat.
and then they got to rollin' into these hamlets and doing these shows of force you know, cowboy shit for fun. Like this one time, I swear to god, they thought it'd be funny to give these little kids, like, porn mags like Hustler and Maxim and shit, show the little hajis what we're fighting for.
this old Iraqi comes storming out, starts screaming at our interpreter about how we're fucking up their morals or some dumb shit, right?
and he's super fucking pissed. The old man's got an R. P.G.
what?
delta fuckin' freaks. They lob like 26 mark-19 rounds.
they fuck up the whole hamlet.
fuck. - Bull-fucking-shit.
Ollie North filmed the whole fucking thing.
the Oliver North?
Oliver fuckin' North was standing there with a camera crew from Fox filming the whole thing like it was the turning point in the fucking war.
these delta fucks are like L. A.P. D. cops and D. E.A. agents and fucking air marshals.
you know what I mean?
and they're led by this Napoleon douche who is like a Corporal or some shit in Albuquerque P. D. I swear to god, this motherfucker has got cattle horns - on his Humvee. - This is so colossally retarded, - I can't even say anything about it. - Godfather knows.
he's been ducking us on the comms for the past couple weeks.
but they're here now, brad, and they're rolling with you.
no fuckin' way. We're working with reservists?
that's some bullshit.
look at this motherfucker.
check it out. If I'm lying, I'm dying.
that's a real marine.
we're out of our M. O.P. P.S.
right now. - Yes, sir.
you can actually see it rolling downhill.
Yep, here it comes.
change in S. O.P.
out of our M. O.P. P. suits. You've 5 min to get right, then we're red-con one.
we're back in cammies! - So fresh and so clean.
fuck, I don't have bootpants.
my balls smell like Jack's mouth.
how do you know what his mouth smells like?
cause my balls were in it.
what the fuck do they do over there, man?
no, really, if we're not in our M. O.P. P. suits, that means there's no W. M.Ds
if there's no W. M.D. S, then why are we here in the first place?
I knew you were a fucking gay-ass liberal.
you tried to pretend by invading iraq with us, but I knew.
I'm serious, Ray. Isn't that the whole point of us being here?
the point is we get to kill people, you dumb fuck.
what's the difference anyway, man?
I mean, the war's almost over.
we're just about done with this bitch.
shit, man, they're taking everything.
Yeah, they're pretty much liberated around here.
ray, stay focused.
we have a mission. - Yeah, some mission...
cross the magic line.
what the fuck can that be all about?
that's us. War pig, then recon.
the line is on 34 northern.
on the other side? The Iraqis.
and they're mechanized.
focus, Ray.
focus.
watch for mines, Ray.
remember, this is bad-guy country.
reporter, do you know what you're supposed to do if the Humvee gets hit by a mine? You're supposed to curl up like a bitch.
Trombley, make nice. - You know how to curl up like a bitch, don't you, reporter?
what is believed to bethe final assault on the city's defenders.
and now for cricket...
bbc says they're puttin' whoop-ass on Baghdad.
and we're out here in the fucking sticks.
man, turn that shit off.
... disappointing results, "but," he said, "there's always a next time.
we're out here under the radar where nobody knows we're here.
hopefully, it'll fuckin' stay that way.
once more into the great good night.
"cry havoc "and let slip the dogs of war.
man, when I get home, I am gonna eat the fuck out of my girlfriend's pussy.
is that Shakespeare?
Shakespeare wrote that?
about his girlfriend's pussy?
godfather, Godfather.
I take it the L. A.Vs in front of us just crossedthe magic line.
the L. A.Vs report enemy contact on both sides of the road.
rockets, mortars and machine guns.
Hitman, Hitman, small arms fire to our three o'clock, 2-5-0 meters out.
I have no targets.
no targets.
Walt, what are you shooting at?
I got muzzle flashes behind those walls.
hold on, buddy! That's a fuckin'village over there.
I see fuckin' fire coming in. - Not from the houses!
there are people in that village.
all Hitman Two... - They ain't shooting at us.
... one-six north on route green. Break.
they've made contact with a squad-sized force. Over.
Roger.
halt the vehicle. - All right.
l. A.Vs have stopped.
enemy! Enemy, both sides! Break!
my God. Is he crying?
no, he's not.
he's just nervous.
we're gonna die if they don't get us out of here!
they sent us to die!
okay, fuck it. He's crying.
all Hitman Victors, this is Hitman Two.
be advised, the L. A.Vs are egressing to the south. Break.
we pull back into a defensive position and dropping mortars. Over.
that's a solid copy.
Trombley, the L. A.Vs will be coming up on our left.
do not engage.
if you do, they'll schwack us.
Jesus Christ.
tracers skipping around us.
that's our own guys, shooting down the axis of our convoy.
all Hitman Two Victors, hold your fire...
fucking reservists.
hold, Delta. Over.
is that the reservists firing on the ville?
Walt! - It's Delta.
they're laying down F. P.F. on the village.
it's all fucked up. - Get those guys on the net.
man, they got passed down. We have no comms with Delta.
I don't know, maybe the fucking retards will just run out of ammo.
God damn, this is gonna be a long night.
this is Assassin One. We are set.
assassin One, this is Assassin Two...
assassin One Two, this is Assassin One Three, we have local enemy entrenched 400 meters to the north. Break.
possible enemy mortar position.
north 1, 000 meters. Interrogative. - Stay in line!
are you in the position to observe and persecute the target?
assassin One Three, this is Assassin One Two.
we are static.
stand by while I roll the Godfather back.
assassin One Two out. Break break.
they all got blankets on to hide their heat signatures, right, Sergeant Colbert?
a week ago, they didn't know we could see their thermals at night.
now they're adapting.
didn't work for that guy.
get down! - No!
cease fire!
cease fucking fire, Sergeant!
sergeant!
cease fire, motherfucker! - Cease fire!
cease fire now!
cease fucking fire!
sergeant! What the fuck?
my staff Sergeant told me to engage all movement.
what are you doing? You dumb motherfucker, you realize you're shooting at Marines?
I saw an Iraqi helmet.
I got this, Corporal.
fuck.
two Actual, this is Two One.
who the fuck is shooting at us?
fuckin' L. A.P. D. cops from Delta!
they fucking love shooting Mexicans.
it was Alpha, Gabe.
alpha.
mistakes happen.
two One Actual, what's your status?
everyone likes to shoot Mexicans, even Mexicans.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
this is accurate mortar fire. Request permission to egress.
negative. Our orders are to hold our position.
we're blocking for Alpha. Over.
there's a fuckin' braindead idea. - That's a hold.
we're covering Alpha's assault.
check out the retard cas-evacing lamb chops.
man, that's fucking intense when you think about it, homes.
here's this poor farmer who's out there...
shut the fuck up.
fucking fish in a barrel.
same motherfuckers who tried to smoke your ass.
... the most dramatic pictures are showing
american Marines in Baghdad city center pulling down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein.
fighting seems to have come to an end...
turn that shit off. - All right, fine.
apparently, these motherfuckers up here don't listen to the BBC.
no talking, no radio. Jeez, Brad.
grab the mag.
how about this guy over here? - No, man, over here, J. J.
Bobby, use my camera too, man. - Damn!
fucking reservists, man. - Just take the fucking photo.
be careful, Dan. R. P.G. could be mined.
don't pick shit up till you check it.
copy that.
get up. Get the fuck up. - No no no.
come on. - Okay.
okay, okay. - Now.
got you covered, Eric.
hands.
come on.
hands.
thank you.
you saved our asses. It's the 1st real fighting we've seen.
you move and I'll blow your head off. - I have a family!
we ought to cut his throat like in the Chechen soldier video?
captain, sir... sir, what are you...
sir. Intimidation tactic.
sir, we got this situation under control.
fuck! Fuck! - Bombs!
we got a live one, men!
cover him, Redman.
you motherfuckers.
I'm sorry I shook your hand. You abused that prisoner.
Bravo Two, stay on line.
hold your fire. - No Saddam.
come.
looks like you won some hearts and minds, sir.
and some tongue.
check it out! We got their colors!
Yeah!
I love killing people!
please, I'm a very low soldier. - Fuck that.
you were waiting to kill us.
you didn't put your weapon down.
I'm afraid if we put our weapons down, the police will come and beat us.
everybody under Saddam is silent.
if he say we go to war with America, we say "good."
if he say we don't go to war with America, we say "good."
shit yeah.
we can't drop our weapons either. - We got orders.
next stop is Baghdad. - Sweet, man.
I don't want any war crimes in the back of my truck. Untie his hands.
give him some water.
you letting me go?
how can I go home?
my sergeant, he sees me, - he find out I didn't fight. - Negro, ain't no Saddam.
know what I mean? Ain't no Iraqi army.
you ain't got a sergeant no more.
either we killed his ass already or shit he be running away faster than you.
feelin' me?
you're going to Baghdad, my friend.
we got a prisoner collection center there.
Baghdad?
for free?
I'm so happy. Thank you, thank you. I'm so happy.
it's all good, playboy.
thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you.
contact, two kliks!
what the fuck, man?
don't these fucking guys know that we won the war already?
we got ambushed all the way up here.
there still could be some bad guys who want to play.
God damn it, Ray.
no country music.
okay?
dude, it's not a country song, it's a cowboy song.
I hate to break it to you, Ray, but there are no cowboys.
I don't give a fuckwhat you write.
it's gonna come out all liberal media bullshit spin on it anyway.
seriously, what am I supposed to do with all this bullshit you guys constantly talk?
you think I'm some sort of racist psycho redneck?
what, you ain't?
and you ain't some fucking militant taco-bender revolutionary?
see, reporter? No outsider can understand how we really are.
we're all fucking brothers.
and we're all fucking alpha males. - We gotta constantly test each other.
all we do is fight for position in the pack, dawg.
all that training we do, the martial arts, to grappling...
is for practice, but it's also for real, to achieve dominance over a motherfucker.
we do the same thing mentally.
it's prison rules, dawg.
we probe for any fucking weakness we can find...
family, race, brains, looks...
anything you have on a motherfucker, you wear it the fuck out.
being a Marine isn't about words, anyways.
it's about your fucking actions.
in the civilian world, a fool slaps a "protect the planet" sticker on his car, suddenly he's all about the environment and shit.
don't matter that he drives that fucking car, fires up his computer and video games and cell phone every night with electricity made from nuclear power, coal and fucking melted baby seal oil.
nuh-uh, I got a dolphin sticker on my shit, so I'm all about saving the fucking planet.
in our fucking Marine corps civilization it don't matter what a motherfucker says.
only thing that matters is, dawg, when you charge that motherfucking machinegun when the motherfucker tells you to charge the motherfucking machinegun.
shit, everybody in this platoon is a hard charger.
Marines bitch about everything, man... chow, fucking moron officers, no time for a combat jack...
you never hear a Marine in this platoon bitch that we could die at any second.
hell no. - That's what we signed up for.
Hoorah that, motherfucker.
fucking care if some latte-sipping bisexual college student reading about Justin Timberlake in Rolling Stone
thinks I'm a psycho racist cracker? Fuck no.
I'd give my life for any brother in here.
I know any one of them would do the same for me.
you think it matters if I call fucking T a nigger?
fucking love that big dark green marine and his big old beautiful nigger dick.
love all my dirty spic brothers here.
and I love this fucking cracker-ass inbred racist peckerwood fuck.
I don't know why I do, dawg, but I do.
cause I'm pretty and I shave my balls.
want to touch 'em, reporter?
no. Thanks.
look, man, I joined the Marine corps 10 days after I graduated high school.
I went to school with all these rich kids at St. Tammany's parish, but I was an apartment kid.
my mom worked. I worked summers digging footings on the weekends.
I was a dishwasher at D'Angelo's pizzeria.
I busted my ass.
became a recon Marine since I was 19.
my shit is tight as fuck.
I know that, my brothers in this platoon know that, so fuck all of you.
damn, war scribe, you just spit on my fucking rack, dawg.
where? - There.
you see that pile of dried camel dung?
that's my fucking pillow, dawg. You fucking spit on it, fool.
you're a heinous-asswhite boy.
I'm sorry.
Screwby
I want a station at 30 mikes, holding at three cherubs southwest, holding area chevy, carrying four hellfires.
misfit Two One, this is Recon Three.
solid copy on checkin. Stand by for sixline.
have all the other drivers fill up the fleet together.
check the air filter on that Humvee.
Ampusel, grab me a donkey dick.
these damn runflats. - Dirty Earl!
I can fix anything from a screen door to a broken heart.
Trombley, did you eat?
Yes, Sergeant.
you hydrated? - Yes, Sergeant.
have you defecated? - No, Sergeant.
fuck! - We have a long day ahead of us.
I need you to take a dump now before we get on the road.
before, hand me the bolt cutters. - Outstanding job yesterday, gentlemen.
can I help you with something, Gunny?
sergeant, yesterday we had a trial by fire.
I want you to know, Brad, that I'm here for you and your men.
are there any combat stress reactions anyone needs to talk about?
remember,
I'm the certified combat stress instructor.
fuck, fuck!
it did it again.
no, we're good, Gunny.
but we would be better if you were getting us the gun lube and batteries we need.
that might do it for my combat stress.
Yeah, mine too!
dirty Earl, you up for worm dirt?
why didn't you do it first?
I don't know, Sarge. - Rudy, you havn't got any common sense.
I know, brother. - Sgt, the spare caught a bullet too.
fuck! - Ready to kill, gunnery sir.
stay hard, James.
that's where it's hanging up. I get off maybe 10 rounds before it jams.
this shit is totally ineffective in these conditions.
we need L. S.A.
lieutenant.
sir, the main weapon on your point vehicle is unreliable.
given the prevailing climatic conditions, using this lubricant is like trying to buttfuck a virgin underaged phutak whore with chalk...
when KY is clearly called for, sir.
you'll have to deal with it, Sergeant.
we have four more towns to assault through today.
you want logistics, join the army.
Marines make do.
Marines, I just want you to know, the commander feels that it was our team that scored the touchdown yesterday for Godfather.
of course Godfather's happy. He's trying to get his full bird on our backs.
at least I got to bust my cherry.
my point is we gotta follow Godfather wherever he leads, no matter how fucked up it happens to be.
sure do. - Stafford, yesterday we ran the gauntlet with no ass and no air, and for what?
fuckin' artillery blew the shit outta that town after we rolled through it.
we're reconnaissance Marines.
swift, silent and deadly.
and Godfather knows this.
and he knows when he sends us into the shit, like yesterday, we'll probably come out on top.
cause we're the best.
but that don't make it right.
beaver Hunter, why are you even here?
after yesterday any cognizant person with a speck of common sense would have caught the first truck south.
Thanks.
yo, son, you shit on my shitter.
just wipe it off or something.
Trombley, this shitter's the only luxury I got out here!
screwby.
devil dog, your aim sucks.
pappy, if lance Corporal Trombley's as good with his saw as he is with his shitter, I think team one has issues.
is it correct to surmise from your sitrep, that we're gonna be rolling through these towns with a lot of ass today?
Yes, Captain.
we got kudos directly from General Mattis, I might add, for punching through yesterday where R. C.T. 1 failed to go.
but now it looks like we're back to being one unit among many.
and unfortunately, when we're rolling with the regimental combat team, we can get lost in the middle of all that ass.
the only way we're gonna get back into the game and score like we did yesterday is to find another mission where we can break off.
and, Captain Patterson, you can depend on Godfather to look for any opportunity to get us back into the game.
count on it.
now, gentlemen, keep your powder dry.
I have a present for you.
l. S.A.
scammed some off the guys in R. C.T. 1.
sir, not to get homoerotic about this, but I could kiss ya.
get that mark19 properly lubed.
now we're talking about killing some motherfuckers.
Matt, hurry up and get off the fucking dirt. We gotta go.
this place gives me the creeps.
Yeah, those guys waving at us are probably the same ones who tried to kill us yesterday.
damn, homes.
hit with R. P.Gs
Yeah, a buddy of mine in one seven had to fucking clean up a Humvee that got hit like that.
said he found the driver's fingers in the engine compartment.
how did they know they were the driver's fingers?
cause they were still gripping the steering wheel, fucknuts.
we oughta shoot some of these dogs.
Trombley, I keep telling you we don't shoot dogs.
we shoot people.
and we Generally only shoot people if we have to.
I'm afraid of dogs.
you're afraid of dogs?
were you bitten in your formative years?
my dad was once.
the dog bit him and my dad jammed his hand down the dog's throat, ripped up his fucking stomach.
where did we find this guy, man?
I like cats.
remember how the kids would come running out to us in Afghanistan?
Yeah. - Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
eyes on the village confirms no enemy presence.
captain America, brah.
winning the war one souvenir at a time, right?
shit, - get that on video? - Fuck yeah.
fucking scumbag, man.
that's Bravo Three's commander.
check it out.
sergeant!
for the life of me, I could only find a black one.
have you located any red ones?
no, sir.
if you do, you'll be sure to let me know?
Yes, sir.
P. F.C. Christeson, how far do you make it from the berm to the edge of that hut?
about 100 meters.
120 meters.
not bad.
about 225.
see that beehiveshaped thing? - Yeah.
that's where they cook their bread.
it's always gonna show hot in a thermal.
it's all about the windows and doors, man.
entrances and exits.
screwby.
yeah?
I'm, uh...
concerned about Captain America.
those guys are with R. C.T. 1.
move, move, move! - What the fuck?
we don't have comms for that unit.
fuck, that's women and children.
cease fire!
cease fire!
do not engage. - Hold your fire, hold your fire!
all Hitman Victors, we've been observing this hamlet.
it's only women and children.
do not engage.
sir, they're shooting that hamlet in error!
sir, we don't have any comms with R. C.T. 1
and they're shooting that hamlet in error!
laser on.
spot.
range 71 is at heading 030.
link them up.
cleared hot.
71, missile away.
Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two two.
who cleared that helo hot?
this is Hitman Two. Nothing on our nets. Over.
Interrogative:
does anyone have positive I. D. on enemy personnel there?
unaware at this time. Over.
range 71 is off left, addressing south.
standing by for B. D.A.
they fucking got good effect on target.
range 71 copies. Good effects, one building destroyed.
dip?
Yeah, thanks.
dawg, we was like, 13 or 14 and we were pedaling around in this neighborhood I grew up in, just east of L. A.
we saw some cholos from another hood.
and we thought we was all hard gangbanger wannabes.
so we started saying, "Fuck off, yo! "Fuck off,
throwing and flashing signs to them and stuff.
so they started throwing down on us.
kicking our little asses.
then some of the older dawgs from our hood come out, grab those fools, took one behind the tastee freez...
they stabbed him up with a screwdriver.
killed the cholo.
see, Generally white people, they don't drag a dude behind the tastee freez and stab him to death with a screwdriver.
so after that day I decided.
I'm gonna hang with white people.
well, here you are.
excuse me.
did you get a picture of my girlfriend from Leon?
I don't think so.
straight blonde hair, brown eyes?
she have a big stain on her face?
no
haven't seen her.
this town Ar Rifa runs right up on the M. S.R.
for two kliks. Must be 75, 000 people in it.
our mission is to haul ass past it.
after that, what's next, sir?
haul ass through the next one, hope the Iraqis keep their heads down.
sir, in that last hamlet, all it took was one shot.
that was just an undisciplined grunt from R. C.T. One.
everybody opened up and schwacked it over nothing.
we could only keep our own on it clean, dawg.
what these other motherfuckers do in this big wide A-O ain't on us.
Yeah, it's hard enough just keeping our own guys out of the shit.
we can't worry about the rest of the world.
I know you all saw our own C. O.
try to fire off in the middle of all that.
fucking Encino man. - But he missed though.
badly. - Look, Brad, can't live in the past.
you need to snap to.
we got a lot of shit ahead of us.
Roger that, sir.
mount up!
all Hitman Two Victors, quick hold to Herringbone. Break.
Hitman Three has fallen behind.
Hitman Two, Two One Bravo set.
two Two, set.
how'd that line go?
Q-Tip!
what?
looks like Two men in black pajamas, creeping along at our nine o'clock.
200 meters. - Are they armed?
I think so.
should I light them up?
Christeson's got two foot-mobiles, maybe with weapons.
200 m to our 9 o'clock.
if they got weapons, light them the fuck up.
Hitman Two Three, this is Two One.
Interrogative: what are we engaging?
Hitman Two One, this is Two Three...
you're shooting too high.
there you go. - Bravo Three is ready to push.
we're Oscar Mike.
let's go, guys. - battalion is rolling.
maintain suppressive fire. - Let's go, let's go!
mount up!
go go go!
Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
our command Victor's made contact with an R. P.G. team.
we have engaged them. How copy?
let's go! We're Oscar Mike!
mount up!
go go!
you know what?
we were just fighting actual guerrillas.
Screwby! - Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
do you copy? Over.
Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
we've suppressed an R. P.G. team. How copy? Over.
Hitman Actual, this is Assassin Actual.
be advised we are taking inaccurate fire from the northeast.
Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two. Do you copy? Over.
son of a bitch! - Why are they stopping?
fuck.
why the fuck did you stop?
Bravo Three got an order from Hitman.
I didn't receive any such order.
sir, this is contrary to our S. O.P.
we're bunched up in the open, and that town is definitely hostile.
Hitman, this is Hitman Two. Do you copy?
damn it, Hitman's not on comms.
do you have any information, Sergeant? Why aren't we in a defensive position?
all I know is that Hitman ordered my platoon to stop.
this is his goat rodie.
Jesus Christ, Nate! You're alive.
Dave, what the fuck is going on?
you were taken out by an R. P.G. team.
gunny Wynn's dead.
if you need a ride, Nate, mi casa es su casa.
we've stopped based on an erroneous report. No One in Bravo Two was hit.
hell are we doing here?
this is the type of Vietnam shit gets a whole company wiped out.
sir, I'm worried that there are people in that ville trying to organize a mass R. P.G. attack against us.
I think my concerns are reasonable.
do you want us to set up a sniper position?
sir, do you want us to set up a sniper position?
push security out farther. Let's make the best of this.
I'm gonna find the Captain. - Punch out 20!
leon, Christopher, punch out 20! - Go go go go!
I'm gonna call this one in right now.
sir, that's a cunt hair over 200 meters, sir.
that's danger-close for artillery.
Danger-close?
sir, "danger-close" is an artillery strike within 600 meters of a friendly position.
that would be us.
200 meters...
that's pretty much on top of our heads.
dumb motherfucker, sir.
even the most boot-fucked marine knows danger-close.
you're way outta line. - Skipper!
what the fuck is going on here? You weren't on your comms!
I'm calling in a fire mission.
sir, I don't like this. These two get their fucking heads together it's fucking dangerous!
it's the oldest play in the book...
officers calling in danger-close fire missions to get medals.
lieutenant Fick, you need to square these shitbirds away.
you need to N. J.P. that man.
tell me exactly what you're doing.
I'm calling in a fire mission on a hunter-killer R. P.G. team.
there is no R. P.G. team. I called it in. My men destroyed it.
lieutenant, it doesn't matter if we're right or wrong.
you and your men can't disobey orders.
an officer who does needs to be relieved of his command!
sir,
I'm merely trying to pass you accurate information.
there is no hunter-killer R. P.G. team.
what is your order, sir?
I'm calling in a fire mission...
at Papa Quebec 038 degrees, 200 meters.
aye, sir.
steel Rain, Steel Rain, this is Hitman.
fire mission. Over.
sir, should we dig in for the fire mission?
there won't be a fire mission.
Hitman's using the wrong protocols.
what?
Hitman has the grids all designated wrong.
there won't be a fire mission.
there's a switch!
for once our asses get saved by sheer incompetence.
out.
Hitman, this is Steel Rain.
reconfirm grid zone designator.
what do you mean? - Stand by, Hitman.
break break. Assassin, this is Steel Rain.
your grid zone designators are OK.
message to observer: Papa Uniform 149...
five gun one around. H. E. delay in effect.
target number Juliet Echo November 1001.
splash in five seconds.
five seconds to splashdown!
sir, two hits... - Suspected Ba'ath party headquarters.
that's a lot of ordinance we just dropped in the middle of a city.
I'm worried about civilian casualties.
looks like Alpha hit something with that.
it pays to have the right protocols when you're calling in a fire mission.
I don't see any muzzle flashes. - Why do we have to see them?
Trombley, shut up.
I got flashes!
where?
200 meters, my 11 o'clock.
second story, white building with the sandbags on the roof.
two buildings behind the roadblock. - Yeah, got it.
his head's bobbing.
we're cleared to engage. - Right on, right on!
die, fucker, die die!
nice! - It worked, it worked!
damn, sucker,
I just got some.
look at me, Brad. I'm a man now.
just like you...
except I don't look like a faggot and talk all educated.
watch your sectors.
most people in America right now probably think of Iraq as a dangerous country.
now if I were to stand up,
I might get killed.
but to us, behind this wheel, it's pretty safe.
so to us,
iraq is a safe country right here.
I feel pretty safe. Do you feel safe?
pretty safe, I guess. - See?
it's all relative.
the natives are getting restless.
prayer is a good thing.
maybe it'll keep them too preoccupied to shoot at us.
sir, the scuttlebutt I'm hearing says you may be relieved of command.
there could be an investigation.
for trying to unfuck Hitman when he's about to drop arty on his own fucking company?
that's brilliant.
sir, your leadership is the only thing I have absolute confidence in.
I'll have the right to address any allegations before anything is formalized.
I'm assured of this.
sir, to highlight my growing lack of confidence in the strategic plan, can you explain why we are strong-pointing this hostile city in tin-plated Humvees while M-1 tanks,
l. A.V. s and Amtracs roll past?
isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
I mean how exactly did this happen?
you wouldn't believe it if I told you.
conserve your fire. It's gonna be a long night.
there's no plan for this, Pap.
for what?
strong-pointing a walled town with Humvees.
it all feels so random... What we're doing.
running here: shooting.
running there: bombing.
that might be a legit target burning over there, it might be a school, Pap.
I hope it's legit.
I hope this is good karma.
everything here is ancient, Pap.
we're in an old old place.
Yep.
white flag.
could be some Habudabu trickster shit.
let's go.
help please.
help. - Movin' on!
corpsman! - Get the corpsman!
Saddam... Fedayeen shoot.
not you.
Saddam.
you kill Ba'ath party...
Saddam... very good.
saddam in our city shooting at you. Not us.
we help...
come.
I'll show you. Come. - Okay.
captain!
call battalion.
battalion's on the net.
godfather wants to see you.
keep a handle on this till I get back.
in Ar Rifa, this commander taught us something about seizing the initiative.
earlier today, when his company came under attack by fedayeen paramilitary forces, laying in ambush with R. P.Gs, he chose to stop and bring the fight to them.
captain Patterson, greetings. - Sir.
I need the translator.
we knocked out Ba'ath headquarters. We've opportunity...
there's a school of thought that says we shouldn't stopped, particularly given the proximity to a hostile city.
but this kind of aggressiveness is what I mean by interrupting the enemy's own decision-making cycle.
it's against all doctrine, but as the General often reminds me, doctrine is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
the fact is I just got off the nets with chaos, and the General is impressed with our initiative.
we are on his radar screen.
gentlemen, we're coming out from beneath all this ass and getting back into the game.
and he's given us a tasker.
this is the Qal'at Sukkar airfield.
a British paratroop regiment is staging to hit the field at dawn.
the General has advised me that they are running late.
and he suggested...
if we're up for it.
that we can get to the field first.
to do this, we have to cross 40 kliks.
godfather needs an airfield.
sir?
we've good intelligence from the locals on the Ba'athist and Republican guard in this town.
we can exploit...
no time. We're pulling out in next hour. See to it, gentlemen.
all you find, we find.
... together.
Meesh, what's this guy trying to tell me?
they are glad to be liberated.
okay, I got that.
what's he trying to tell me right now?
they want to show us the locations of the Republican guard,
Ba'ath party and fedayeen forces.
maybe some weapon caches, - maybe even some chemical weapons. - Okay then, we got our work cut out for us.
tell him he go to come with us.
tell him I go to take him back... - No, d-do... no.
that's not how we're rolling, eh?
we are pulling out of here soon.
but rest assured,
godfather has a legit plan to exploit the situation.
we are going to give these righteous people...
I. R. chem-lights.
they are going to set them up where the bad guys are, mark them for the bombers who go to bomb out of whatever's marked.
american Air Force.
the best in the world.
how do we know this guy isn't going to put it on the homes of people he owes money to?
how do we know for sure that he's even on our side?
how do we know unless we debrief these people and check their intel?
here.
no thanks, Meesh.
okay, it's not the good shit, but it's local brewed.
you should write this down, reporter. The war's actually not about pussy.
it's about N. A.M. B.L. A. You know: North American Man-Boy Love Association.
places like Thailand where they used to fuck little boys and shit, they're drying up.
we're opening up Iraq for a whole new supply of kids, man.
ray, please!
I'm trying to gauge the approach to our target.
right!
cause we're gonna drive 40 kliks off-road in the dark to an airfield with Republican guard on it by ourselves.
and they say that I did too much acid in high school.
Christ, the business end of Mattis's crack pipe must be hot to the fucking touch.
Brad, listen, there's no way... - Get down!
Why? - Get down!
what?
hold your fire! Hold your fire!
holy fuck!
give me your headset. - Why are we hating on the mexicans?
who's up?
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
that is a friendly unit northbound on the M. S.R. firing on our position.
I say again, that is blue-on-blue fire.
they're northbound toward Assassin's position.
how copy? - Those are fucking reservists!
I saw the markings. - Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.
you all right?
Yeah, I think so. - I'm fucking wet!
did you piss on me?
don't fucking tell me I have reporter piss on me.
Brad, they shot our fucking water cans.
we're Oscar Mike.
damn it.
40 kliks, no fucking water.
fuck it, at least you're dry.
all Victors, this is Godfather.
stand by, H&S has a truck down.
stop.
start, stop, start, stop!
Jesus!
I'm beginning to think Godfather's just a big cocktease.
they shot a hole in our fucking tire.
you guys all right? - That was some bullshit.
trigger-happy reservists. - Hey, Iceman.
can you believe those reservists? They just shot us up.
it was shock trauma.
bunch of fucking doctors.
didn't they have to take an oath or some shit against fucking people up?
you need some security while you do this.
I'll get with the Lt... - Belay that, devil dog!
godfather's gots a mission, and that mission is now.
abandon this vehicle, put your asses on another vehicle.
let's get moving. - But, - Sergeant... - No buts!
these asses ain't in gear 10 minutes ago, you's in direct disobedience of a direct order from godfather himself!
what are you carrying? - Battalion's chow,
M-16s, ammo, 400 pounds of C-4, couple of cases of Claymore mines, all kind of shit like that.
get your bubbies in a running truck and load up right now.
you hear me?
two One, this is Hitman Two. Interrogative:
where is the turn? Over.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
it's coming right up. 100 meters. Over.
two One, it better be. I can assure you that Godfather's watching.
dude, I am so lost right now.
don't worry about it, buddy. I know where we're going.
we passed seven villages. There's one more.
hey...
do you remember the gay dog episode of "South park"?
the one where Sparky runs away cause he's humping all those other dogs and shit?
Yes, Ray, I...
I do remember it very well.
but I don't see what relevance this has on our present status.
there's the hamlet, our turn.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we're making that turn now. Over.
Roger that.
nice job. Over.
Hey, Brad?
do your big gay Al for me.
come on, buddy!
do it for your old pal Ray, the one who made the right turn.
well, hello there, little pup.
I'm big gay Al.
have you been outcast?
fuck yeah.
they had this gay bar open up in the town where I'm from in Michigan, and people trashed it every night.
they had to close it after a month.
see, but there's money in that, Trombley.
did I tell you I'm gonna open my own gay bar when I get back home?
it's gonna be called the golden stream. And it's gonna be like this big urinal, right?
and there's gonna be this two-way mirror that everybody pisses against.
that way when you're sitting at the bar having drinks, there's like all these big fucking giant cocks just pissing right at you.
corporal, are you a faggot?
you know what? I'm gonna franchise that shit.
you can have Michigan, Trombley.
very lucrative territory, homosexually speaking.
that's not funny, Corporal Person.
ray, give it a rest.
echo Five Charlie, this is Echo Five Echo.
Interrogative: how much further to the airfield?
echo Five Echo, I don't copy.
sergeant?
what? - I just lost my helmet.
what do you want to do, hold a funeral?
sergeant? - We ain't going back for it, Gabe.
get me General Mattis.
chaos actual, this is Godfather.
stand by for traffic. Over.
Roger. Send traffic. Over.
sir, we got Chaos on the net.
chaos, this is Godfather.
teams are out now getting eyes on the field. Break.
we'll have complete sit-rep for you within five mikes. How copy? Over.
solid copy. - Roger that. Out.
chaos is waiting.
brits are in the air.
but our u-2 surveillance picked up four possible t-72 tanks on the iraqi field.
if our eyes affirm this intel, Chaos needs to abort the british assault.
they hit the point of no return in under 30 mikes.
so where the fuck are my eyes on that field?
assassin actual, Godfather needs your sit-rep asap. Over.
Roger that. Stand by.
assassin Two Three, this is Assassin actual. How copy?
assassin, this is Assassin Two Three.
we are one klik out. 40 mikes from objective.
I say again, 40 mikes. Over.
Roger.
alpha is 40 mikes away from getting eyes on the field.
these guys have bitched and moaned, moaned and bitched that I haven't given them a legitimate recon mission.
I finally give them one, and they fucking fail me.
we don't have that option.
we will recon that field.
we will recon it in force.
I want the entire battalion Oscar Mike inside of 10 minutes.
sir, that's not a reconnaissance mission.
that's an assault. - Semantics.
what about the T-72s?
the violence of action is to our advantage.
I'll request that division adjust the R. O.E. accordingly.
Roger that, sir.
assassin Actual, this is Godfather.
abort that mission. R. T.B.
Interrogative: you want me to return to base?
affirmative.
all Hitman Two Gunners be advised.
alpha has a team reentering friendly lines to the north.
how copy?
get your team ready.
we're assaulting the airfield less than 10 mikes.
wake up.
Walt, range the Mark-19 as far out as you feel comfortable engaging targets with good effect.
what about Alpha's recon?
they're out of time.
I'm up. - They fucked it.
we're going up against tanks.
grab a diesel. Let's mount up.
it's on race. Two Two's up.
yo, man, if you have to do number one, go now, because once I start the car, I am not stopping.
naked Marine, - the Internet loves you! - Fuck you, Person.
get your ass back in the vehicle. - Where's Lilley?
we're Oscar Mike, man.
move it.
you really are gay, aren't you? - Brah I'm not cool.
this is Godfather.
godfather Actual has declared all Iraqis hostile in proximity to the objective. How copy? Over.
affirmative. Copy that.
godfather just changed the rules of engagement.
he's lowered the bar.
shit, he's removed the bar.
new R. O.E. has all Iraqis on or near that airfield declared hostile.
a free-fire zone?
I'm not passing that word.
keep this change in the R. O.E. off our net.
got any comms with those A-10s?
negative.
those jets are goddamn Air Force.
they shoot marines.
that map showed fences.
if there's fences, we'll need the bolt cutters.
they're under the reporter's seat.
can you lift your ass in a hurry if we need to get to those bolt cutters?
I think so.
you have to get out of the Humvee to open it.
I don't see a fence anyway. - Do you need them now?
Charlie just cleared a guard tower.
what is it, walt? - Fucking shit!
Mark-19's jammed.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
our mark-19 is down.
I say again, our main gun is down.
shit!
either unfuck it now or get on your fucking saw.
I'm trying.
I see men running, 200 meters, 10 o'clock.
armed? - They're something.
well, the order is everyone is declared hostile.
light 'em the fuck up.
shooting motherfuckers like it's cool.
fuck!
all right, gents, keep your heads on a swivel.
maintain your dispersion.
everybody stay on a line.
all Hitman Two Victors, maintain dispersion.
target building 500 meters ahead. Break.
Hitman Three is holding our flank. Over.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
have two tanks, northwest side of the warehouse. Over.
this is Hitman Two. Affirmative.
they appear to be stationary. No personnel.
Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Three.
I have an unmanned Z. P.U.-57 Tac-2.
appears to be abandoned. Over.
two Three, this is Two. Copy that.
he's got his fucking bayonet out.
doing his Rambo. - Follow my tracers!
he's shooting at scraps of metal.
can you believe that fucking retard is in charge of people?
Jesus Christ.
engage those buildings!
sir, that's more than 3, 000 meters away.
range of my fifty is 1830.
move into position.
engage! Engage!
should I light them up?
no.
we're not engaging.
those aren't military buildings.
they're civilian huts.
Yeah, looks like Saddam's big bad republican guard hajis got wind I was coming.
as the great warrior-poet Ice Cube once said, "If the day does not require an A. K. "it is good.
they stick around and man those, we'd have been dead before we even saw them.
take a picture of me... - Dude, lighten up.
then again the world wouldn't have to deal with the prospect of you returning to your cretinous daughter-fucking trailer-park red-state shithole, and producing mutant, whiskey tango, scrotum-faced, bucktoothed, zit-exploding progeny.
heads up.
I need a channel to division main.
lance Corporal Trombley, channel five.
sir.
chaos, this is godfather.
send it.
be advised. We have seized the enemy airfield.
early reports are we've captured several enemy tanks and self-propelled triple-a batteries.
it appears that we've overrun the entire 255th mechanized regiment who have fled.
and sir, we've sustained zero casualties.
outstanding.
thank you.
Roger that. Out.
is that the british paratroopers? - No.
we scrubbed their mission. We got here first.
gentlemen.
we just seized an airfield.
that was pretty fucking ninja.
just keep it dry, eh?
I know they're heinous, bro. I'm living in it.
holy fuck. - Jesus!
that feels good. - Smells like dick juice.
when's the last time you took your boot off?
come on, give it a rest. - You know we can't.
they ordered us to sleep in the damn things.
got some good news...
we're so far ahead of R. C.T. 1, we'll be here a good 24 hours before they show up.
however, there is a bit of concern in some quarters about being overrun, since we don't what's around us out here, so make sure you maintain 50% watch and the comms are good.
we got pre-register on-call artillery if we want it.
sir, has any thought been given to destroying the weapons and ordinance that are sitting over there?
actually that did come up.
but it seems the battalion's supply of C-4 is now unaccounted for.
the battalion supply truck we left last night, it is a smoldering heap of twisted metal and failed hopes in the trustworthiness of the iraqis we are striving so hard to liberate.
what does that mean, sir?
it means we're on one meal a day.
I'm just saying I'm surprised is all, Brad.
I mean, aren't you surprised? - Shut the fuck up.
I mean, I'm betting that they were thinking... That they could just, you know, leave a fully-loaded supply truck laying around.
just like you could anywhere in american, you know.
I mean, you park your unlocked car in Detroit or Baltimore, I mean, your shit's gonna be there guaranteed when you get back from the day spa with your skin all exfoliated and shit, right?
I mean seriously, homes, why would our Iraqi brethren want 400 lbs of C-4, claymores and crates of M-16s? I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
wait!
they could be using all that C-4 for, like, a giant 4th of july celebration.
what do you think?
I think it's time for you to shut the fuck up.
nice job shooting those camels, Trombley.
I think I shot one of those Iraqis too.
I saw him fall.
all we saw was camels going down. - Camel killer.
look, I didn't mean to shoot innocent camels, all right?
I'm sure I shot people.
shouldn't you two be doing the after-action report on Alpha's failedrecon mission?
what's this about you losing your kevlar?
it bounced off my head, Sergeant Major, last night.
bounced off your head?
I was up on the fifty cal and the Humvee went over a berm, Sergeant Major.
that kevlar wasn't yours to lose!
that was the property of this united states Marine corps!
it belonged to every Marine!
cause of your failure to secure that helmet you've jeopardized every Marine serving today.
I was considering N. J.P. Ing your ass.
sergeant Colbert!
this is what happens when you don't enforce the grooming standards.
the mens gets all lax and then other standards fall.
devil dog here stops using his chinstrap, goes over a bump, kevlar goes flying off his head, and our protective posture...
is weakened.
Roger that, Sergeant Major.
I'm not the fucking retard who lost a whole supply truck.
gimme any target, I'll hit anything out to 700 yards.
what are they dragging?
think they want something?
one humanitarian ration for two blowjobs.
that's the going rate in this part of the world.
Stiney, give me a hand.
stop.
Hey, buddy, can you hear me?
good.
the kid's been zipped with 556.
Marines shot this kid.
fucking jackasses.
trigger-happy motherfucker.
doc, is there anything I can do? - Yeah,
Stiney, get me the battalion surgeon.
we need to cas-evac this kid or he's dead.
done.
Christeson, Stafford, two stretchers to doc, 12 o'clock.
you're a very brave kid.
he's very strong, all right?
doc? - Yeah?
he's been hit by 556.
blew out his calf muscle but there's no arterial bleeding.
he'll make it. - Roger that.
why aren't they angry?
they are grateful to be liberated and welcome the Americans as friends.
these mistakes are unavoidable in war. - Bullshit!
we're fucking recon Marines!
our whole fucking job is to observe and not make these kinds of mistakes.
and we don't fucking shoot unarmed kids.
where did this happen?
dude, they were tending their camels and shit, so who knows where it was.
fuck, man.
Trombley did this.
sir...
priority one surgical pediatric, four bullet wounds to the abdomen, 144 tach weak; 30 rest, 90 over palp. He's... stable for now.
godfather's denied the request to cas-evac the boy.
we need to cas-evac him or he's dead.
I'll go ask the battalion commander again.
thank you, sir.
shot by that asshole Trombley, Brad.
he's been zipped by 556 from Trombley's saw.
don't put this on Trombley.
I'm responsible. - Yeah?
20 other Marines drove by them and didn't shoot.
why don't we bring Trombley here to see what he's done?
don't say that. It was my order.
what can I do here?
not a fucking thing, apparently, Brad.
there's gotta be something we can do.
under the rules, we have to provide him with care until he dies.
Yeah.
well, so...
put him in my care. I'm billeted next to the battalion commander.
if he's in my care and godfather has to watch him die, he might change his order.
right, let's do this. - It's the only chance we got.
all right, on three. - Gentle.
ready, one, two, three.
ready?
let's go.
what the hell is going on here?
we brought him here to die.
get him the fuck out of here.
set him down over here. - Sergeant Major.
what the fuck is going on?
sir.
Bravo Two in rebellion.
because they thinks they shot an Iraqi child.
does he want water?
keep him still.
you're requesting that I send this wounded civilian to the R. C.T. for aid?
problem.
our tactical situation is extremely precarious here.
these are the northern most Marines' positions.
and we are 30 kliks north of them.
we are far behind enemy lines.
we have incomplete intel as to the disposition of the Iraqi units here, here and here.
we don't even know what happened to the 4, 000 troops that were at this airfield six hours ago.
and there's only 350 of us.
what can be done?
option one:
cas-evac by helicopter.
doesn't exist.
army, Marines are engaged.
taking casualties.
last night the Iraqis stopped the army advance.
they turned back 36 apache helicopters, shot a few down.
option two:
I detach a platoon and have them drive kliks through enemy lines to the shock-trauma unit here.
if any of you were a casualty right now.
I don't think I could cas-evac you.
but supposing I could,
I imagine there is some of you think we have to give wounded civilians every consideration we would give ourselves.
that is not true.
the R. O.E. say...
we have to give them the same medical care they would get by local standards.
the standards here are fucking zero.
it's a shitty situation for us, but nobody put a gun to our heads and forced us to come here.
we're all volunteers.
get me Captain Patterson.
Yes, sir.
assassin Actual, this is Godfather Five.
godfather Five, this is Assassin Actual. Send traffic.
D. X. on the net. Over.
standing by. - I'm dispatching an Alpha platoon to take this child to the shock-trauma unit.
huddle up. We're gonna talk.
this is Echo Four Charlie.
assault Two One Bravo's gone.
echo Three Lima is up on Two One Bravo.
we made a mistake today...
collectively and individually.
we must get past this.
can't sit around and call it quits now. We have fighting ahead.
look, guys, we're Americans.
we must make sure when we take a shot that we are threatened.
you gotta see that these people are just like you.
you gotta see past the huts, the camels, the different clothes they wear.
these are people in this fucking country.
this family here might lose a son.
we shot their camels too.
one camel could be a year's income to them.
we're not here to destroy their way of life.
Trombley, you have to be prepared for the possibility of a formal investigation in this shooting.
you need to write it up.
keep your head up.
is it going to be okay, Sergeant?
I mean this...
investigation?
you'll be fine, Trombley.
no, I mean for you, Sergeant, since you gave the all orders.
I don't care about any of this, you know?
I'll be out in a couple of years.
but you...
sergeant, this is your career.
I'll be fine.
Hitman Two Three, this is Hitman Two Two.
watch my six. I'm taking a dump.
Roger that.
I don't want to sound like I'm defending Trombley or anything...
but how come nobody remembers that they declared everybody hostile?
I mean, they told us to shoot at everybody.
Yeah.
but you know what's even more fucked up?
Trombley only shot two bursts maybe seven rounds.
I mean, we're bumping down a dirt road, his targets are like 200 meters out and he hits exactly what the fuck he's shooting at?
I mean, fuck, man, the boy is a cold-on deadeye killer.
Yeah, no shit.
that's 'cause he's a psycho.
but at least he's our psycho.
you all right, reporter?
Yeah, I'm just...
sucking wind.
what happened today...
you need to square those walls.
you'll never make any progress digging that way.
check the air filter on that Humvee.
Ampusel, grab me a donkey dick.
these damn runflats. - Dirty Earl!
I can fix anything from a screen door to a broken heart.
Trombley, did you eat?
Yes, Sergeant.
you hydrated? - Yes, Sergeant.
have you defecated? - No, Sergeant.
fuck! - We have a long day ahead of us.
I need you to take a dump now before we get on the road.
before, hand me the bolt cutters. - Outstanding job yesterday, gentlemen.
can I help you with something, Gunny?
sergeant, yesterday we had a trial by fire.
I want you to know, Brad, that I'm here for you and your men.
are there any combat stress reactions anyone needs to talk about?
remember,
I'm the certified combat stress instructor.
fuck, fuck!
it did it again.
no, we're good, Gunny.
but we would be better if you were getting us the gun lube and batteries we need.
that might do it for my combat stress.
Yeah, mine too!
dirty Earl, you up for worm dirt?
why didn't you do it first?
I don't know, Sarge. - Rudy, you havn't got any common sense.
I know, brother. - Sgt, the spare caught a bullet too.
fuck! - Ready to kill, gunnery sir.
stay hard, James.
that's where it's hanging up. I get off maybe 10 rounds before it jams.
this shit is totally ineffective in these conditions.
we need L. S.A.
lieutenant.
sir, the main weapon on your point vehicle is unreliable.
given the prevailing climatic conditions, using this lubricant is like trying to buttfuck a virgin underaged phutak whore with chalk...
when KY is clearly called for, sir.
you'll have to deal with it, Sergeant.
we have four more towns to assault through today.
you want logistics, join the army.
Marines make do.
Marines, I just want you to know, the commander feels that it was our team that scored the touchdown yesterday for Godfather.
of course Godfather's happy. He's trying to get his full bird on our backs.
at least I got to bust my cherry.
my point is we gotta follow Godfather wherever he leads, no matter how fucked up it happens to be.
sure do. - Stafford, yesterday we ran the gauntlet with no ass and no air, and for what?
fuckin' artillery blew the shit outta that town after we rolled through it.
we're reconnaissance Marines.
swift, silent and deadly.
and Godfather knows this.
and he knows when he sends us into the shit, like yesterday, we'll probably come out on top.
cause we're the best.
but that don't make it right.
beaver Hunter, why are you even here?
after yesterday any cognizant person with a speck of common sense would have caught the first truck south.
Thanks.
yo, son, you shit on my shitter.
just wipe it off or something.
Trombley, this shitter's the only luxury I got out here!
screwby.
devil dog, your aim sucks.
pappy, if lance Corporal Trombley's as good with his saw as he is with his shitter, I think team one has issues.
is it correct to surmise from your sitrep, that we're gonna be rolling through these towns with a lot of ass today?
Yes, Captain.
we got kudos directly from General Mattis, I might add, for punching through yesterday where R. C.T. 1 failed to go.
but now it looks like we're back to being one unit among many.
and unfortunately, when we're rolling with the regimental combat team, we can get lost in the middle of all that ass.
the only way we're gonna get back into the game and score like we did yesterday is to find another mission where we can break off.
and, Captain Patterson, you can depend on Godfather to look for any opportunity to get us back into the game.
count on it.
now, gentlemen, keep your powder dry.
I have a present for you.
scammed some off the guys in R. C.T. 1.
sir, not to get homoerotic about this, but I could kiss ya.
get that mark19 properly lubed.
now we're talking about killing some motherfuckers.
Matt, hurry up and get off the fucking dirt. We gotta go.
this place gives me the creeps.
Yeah, those guys waving at us are probably the same ones who tried to kill us yesterday.
damn, homes.
hit with R. P.Gs
Yeah, a buddy of mine in one seven had to fucking clean up a Humvee that got hit like that.
said he found the driver's fingers in the engine compartment.
how did they know they were the driver's fingers?
cause they were still gripping the steering wheel, fucknuts.
we oughta shoot some of these dogs.
Trombley, I keep telling you we don't shoot dogs.
we shoot people.
and we Generally only shoot people if we have to.
I'm afraid of dogs.
you're afraid of dogs?
were you bitten in your formative years?
my dad was once.
the dog bit him and my dad jammed his hand down the dog's throat, ripped up his fucking stomach.
where did we find this guy, man?
I like cats.
remember how the kids would come running out to us in Afghanistan?
Yeah. - Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
eyes on the village confirms no enemy presence.
captain America, brah.
winning the war one souvenir at a time, right?
shit, - get that on video? - Fuck yeah.
fucking scumbag, man.
that's Bravo Three's commander.
check it out.
sergeant!
for the life of me, I could only find a black one.
have you located any red ones?
no, sir.
if you do, you'll be sure to let me know?
Yes, sir.
P. F.C. Christeson, how far do you make it from the berm to the edge of that hut?
about 100 meters.
120
not bad.
about 225.
see that beehiveshaped thing? - Yeah.
that's where they cook their bread.
it's always gonna show hot in a thermal.
it's all about the windows and doors, man.
entrances and exits.
screwby.
yeah?
I'm, uh...
concerned about Captain America.
those guys are with R. C.T. 1.
move, move, move! - What the fuck?
we don't have comms for that unit.
fuck, that's women and children.
cease fire!
cease fire!
do not engage. - Hold your fire, hold your fire!
all Hitman Victors, we've been observing this hamlet.
it's only women and children.
do not engage.
sir, they're shooting that hamlet in error!
sir, we don't have any comms with R. C.T. 1
and they're shooting that hamlet in error!
laser on.
spot.
range 71 is at heading 030.
cleared hot.
71, missile away.
Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two two.
who cleared that helo hot?
this is Hitman Two. Nothing on our nets. Over.
Interrogative:
does anyone have positive I. D. on enemy personnel there?
unaware at this time. Over.
range 71 is off left, addressing south.
standing by for B. D.A.
they fucking got good effect on target.
range 71 copies. Good effects, one building destroyed.
dip?
Yeah, thanks.
dawg, we was like, 13 or 14 and we were pedaling around in this neighborhood I grew up in, just east of L. A.
we saw some cholos from another hood.
and we thought we was all hard gangbanger wannabes.
so we started saying, "Fuck off, yo! "Fuck off,
throwing and flashing signs to them and stuff.
so they started throwing down on us.
kicking our little asses.
then some of the older dawgs from our hood come out, grab those fools, took one behind the tastee freez...
they stabbed him up with a screwdriver.
killed the cholo.
see, Generally white people, they don't drag a dude behind the tastee freez and stab him to death with a screwdriver.
so after that day I decided.
I'm gonna hang with white people.
well, here you are.
excuse me.
did you get a picture of my girlfriend from Leon?
I don't think so.
straight blonde hair, brown eyes?
she have a big stain on her face?
haven't seen her.
this town Ar Rifa runs right up on the M. S.R for two kliks. Must be 75, 000 people in it.
our mission is to haul ass past it.
after that, what's next, sir?
haul ass through the next one, hope the Iraqis keep their heads down.
sir, in that last hamlet, all it took was one shot.
that was just an undisciplined grunt from R. C.T. One.
everybody opened up and schwacked it over nothing.
we could only keep our own on it clean, dawg.
what these other motherfuckers do in this big wide A-O ain't on us.
Yeah, it's hard enough just keeping our own guys out of the shit.
we can't worry about the rest of the world.
I know you all saw our own C. O.
try to fire off in the middle of all that.
fucking Encino man. - But he missed though.
badly. - Look, Brad, can't live in the past.
you need to snap to.
we got a lot of shit ahead of us.
Roger that, sir.
mount up!
all Hitman Two Victors, quick hold to Herringbone. Break.
Hitman Three has fallen behind.
Hitman Two, Two One Bravo set.
two Two, set.
how'd that line go?
what?
looks like Two men in black pajamas, creeping along at our nine o'clock.
200 meters. - Are they armed?
I think so.
should I light them up?
yo, Gunny!
Christeson's got two foot-mobiles, maybe with weapons.
200 m to our 9 o'clock.
if they got weapons, light them the fuck up.
Hitman Two Three, this is Two One.
Interrogative: what are we engaging?
Hitman Two One, this is Two Three...
you're shooting too high.
there you go. - Bravo Three is ready to push.
we're Oscar Mike.
let's go, guys. - Bataillon is rolling.
maintain suppressive fire. - Let's go, let's go!
mount up!
go go go!
Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
our command Victor's made contact with an R. P.G. team.
we have engaged them. How copy?
let's go! We're Oscar Mike!
mount up!
go go!
you know what?
we were just fighting actual guerrillas.
Screwby! - Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
do you copy? Over.
Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two.
we've suppressed an R. P.G. team. How copy? Over.
Hitman Actual, this is Assassin Actual.
be advised we are taking inaccurate fire from the northeast.
Hitman, Hitman, this is Hitman Two. Do you copy? Over.
son of a bitch! - Why are they stopping?
fuck.
why the fuck did you stop?
Bravo Three got an order from Hitman.
I didn't receive any such order.
sir, this is contrary to our S. O.P.
we're bunched up in the open, and that town is definitely hostile.
Hitman, this is Hitman Two. Do you copy?
damn it, Hitman's not on comms.
do you have any information, Sergeant? Why aren't we in a defensive position?
all I know is that Hitman ordered my platoon to stop.
this is his goat rodie.
Jesus Christ, Nate! You're alive.
Dave, what the fuck is going on?
you were taken out by an R. P.G. team.
gunny Wynn's dead.
if you need a ride, Nate, mi casa es su casa.
we've stopped based on an erroneous report. No One in Bravo Two was hit.
hell are we doing here?
this is the type of Vietnam shit gets a whole company wiped out.
sir, I'm worried that there are people in that ville trying to organize a mass R. P.G. attack against us.
I think my concerns are reasonable.
do you want us to set up a sniper position?
sir, do you want us to set up a sniper position?
push security out farther. Let's make the best of this.
I'm gonna find the Captain. - Punch out 20!
leon, Christopher, punch out 20! - Go go go go!
I'm gonna call this one in right now.
sir, that's a cunt hair over 200 meters, sir.
that's danger-close for artillery.
Danger-close?
sir, "danger-close" is an artillery strike within 600 meters of a friendly position.
that would be us.
200 meters...
that's pretty much on top of our heads.
dumb motherfucker, sir.
even the most boot-fucked marine knows danger-close.
you're way outta line. - Skipper!
what the fuck is going on here? You weren't on your comms!
I'm calling in a fire mission.
sir, I don't like this. These two get their fucking heads together it's fucking dangerous!
it's the oldest play in the book...
officers calling in danger-close fire missions to get medals.
lieutenant Fick, you need to square these shitbirds away.
you need to N. J.P. that man.
tell me exactly what you're doing.
I'm calling in a fire mission on a hunter-killer R. P.G. team.
there is no R. P.G. team. I called it in. My men destroyed it.
lieutenant, it doesn't matter if we're right or wrong.
you and your men can't disobey orders.
an officer who does needs to be relieved of his command!
sir,
I'm merely trying to pass you accurate information.
there is no hunter-killer R. P.G. team.
what is your order, sir?
I'm calling in a fire mission...
038 degrees, 200 meters.
aye, sir.
steel Rain, Steel Rain, this is Hitman.
fire mission. Over.
sir, should we dig in for the fire mission?
there won't be a fire mission.
Hitman's using the wrong protocols.
what?
Hitman has the grids all designated wrong.
there won't be a fire mission.
there's a switch!
for once our asses get saved by sheer incompetence.
out.
Hitman, this is Steel Rain.
reconfirm grid zone designator.
what do you mean? - Stand by, Hitman.
break break. Assassin, this is Steel Rain.
your grid zone designators are OK.
message to observer: Papa Uniform 149...
... 213 Bravo, five gun one around. H. E. delay in effect.
target number Juliet Echo November 1001.
splash in five seconds.
five seconds to splashdown!
sir, two hits... - Suspected Ba'ath party headquarters.
that's a lot of ordinance we just dropped in the middle of a city.
I'm worried about civilian casualties.
looks like Alpha hit something with that.
it pays to have the right protocols when you're calling in a fire mission.
I don't see any muzzle flashes. - Why do we have to see them?
Trombley, shut up.
I got flashes!
where?
200 meters, my 11 o'clock.
second story, white building with the sandbags on the roof.
two buildings behind the roadblock. - Yeah, got it.
his head's bobbing.
we're cleared to engage. - Right on, right on!
die, fucker, die die!
nice! - It worked, it worked!
damn, sucker,
I just got some.
look at me, Brad. I'm a man now.
just like you...
except I don't look like a faggot and talk all educated.
watch your sectors.
most people in America right now probably think of Iraq as a dangerous country.
now if I were to stand up,
I might get killed.
but to us, behind this wheel, it's pretty safe.
so to us,
iraq is a safe country right here.
I feel pretty safe. Do you feel safe?
pretty safe, I guess. - See?
it's all relative.
the natives are getting restless.
prayer is a good thing.
maybe it'll keep them too preoccupied to shoot at us.
sir, the scuttlebutt I'm hearing says you may be relieved of command.
there could be an investigation.
for trying to unfuck Hitman when he's about to drop arty on his own fucking company?
that's brilliant.
sir, your leadership is the only thing I have absolute confidence in.
I'll have the right to address any allegations before anything is formalized.
I'm assured of this.
sir, to highlight my growing lack of confidence in the strategic plan, can you explain why we are strong-pointing this hostile city in tin-plated Humvees while M-1 tanks,
l. A.V. s and Amtracs roll past?
isn't it supposed to be the other way around?
I mean how exactly did this happen?
you wouldn't believe it if I told you.
conserve your fire. It's gonna be a long night.
there's no plan for this, Pap.
for what?
strong-pointing a walled town with Humvees.
it all feels so random... What we're doing.
running here: shooting.
running there: bombing.
that might be a legit target burning over there, it might be a school, Pap.
I hope it's legit.
I hope this is good karma.
everything here is ancient, Pap.
we're in an old old place.
Yep.
white flag.
could be some Habudabu trickster shit.
let's go.
help please.
help. - Movin' on!
corpsman! - Get the corpsman!
Saddam... Fedayeen shoot.
not you.
Saddam.
you kill Ba'ath party...
Saddam... very good.
saddam in our city shooting at you. Not us.
we help...
come.
I'll show you. Come. - Okay.
captain!
call battalion.
battalion's on the net.
godfather wants to see you.
keep a handle on this till I get back.
in Ar Rifa, this commander taught us something about seizing the initiative.
earlier today, when his company came under attack by fedayeen paramilitary forces, laying in ambush with R. P.Gs, he chose to stop and bring the fight to them.
captain Patterson, greetings. - Sir.
I need the translator.
we knocked out Ba'ath headquarters. We've opportunity...
there's a school of thought that says we shouldn't stopped, particularly given the proximity to a hostile city.
but this kind of aggressiveness is what I mean by interrupting the enemy's own decision-making cycle.
it's against all doctrine, but as the General often reminds me, doctrine is the last refuge of the unimaginative.
the fact is I just got off the nets with chaos, and the General is impressed with our initiative.
we are on his radar screen.
gentlemen, we're coming out from beneath all this ass and getting back into the game.
and he's given us a tasker.
this is the Qal'at Sukkar airfield.
a British paratroop regiment is staging to hit the field at dawn.
the General has advised me that they are running late.
and he suggested...
if we're up for it.
that we can get to the field first.
to do this, we have to cross 40 kliks.
godfather needs an airfield.
sir?
we've good intelligence from the locals on the Ba'athist and Republican guard in this town.
we can exploit...
no time. We're pulling out in next hour. See to it, gentlemen.
all you find, we find.
... together.
Meesh, what's this guy trying to tell me?
they are glad to be liberated.
okay, I got that.
what's he trying to tell me right now?
they want to show us the locations of the Republican guard,
Ba'ath party and fedayeen forces.
maybe some weapon caches, - maybe even some chemical weapons. - Okay then, we got our work cut out for us.
tell him he go to come with us.
tell him I go to take him back... - No, d-do... no.
that's not how we're rolling, eh?
we are pulling out of here soon.
but rest assured,
godfather has a legit plan to exploit the situation.
we are going to give these righteous people...
I. R. chem-lights.
they are going to set them up where the bad guys are, mark them for the bombers who go to bomb out of whatever's marked.
american Air Force.
the best in the world.
how do we know this guy isn't going to put it on the homes of people he owes money to?
how do we know for sure that he's even on our side?
how do we know unless we debrief these people and check their intel?
here.
no thanks, Meesh.
okay, it's not the good shit, but it's local brewed.
you should write this down, reporter. The war's actually not about pussy.
it's about N. A.M. B.L. A. You know: North American Man-Boy Love Association.
places like Thailand where they used to fuck little boys and shit, they're drying up.
we're opening up Iraq for a whole new supply of kids, man.
ray, please!
I'm trying to gauge the approach to our target.
right!
cause we're gonna drive 40 kliks off-road in the dark to an airfield with Republican guard on it by ourselves.
and they say that I did too much acid in high school.
Christ, the business end of Mattis's crack pipe must be hot to the fucking touch.
Brad, listen, there's no way... - Get down!
Why? - Get down!
what?
hold your fire! Hold your fire!
holy fuck!
give me your headset. - Why are we hating on the mexicans?
who's up?
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
that is a friendly unit northbound on the M. S.R firing on our position.
I say again, that is blue-on-blue fire.
they're northbound toward Assassin's position.
how copy? - Those are fucking reservists!
I saw the markings. - Hitman Two One, this is Hitman Two.
you all right?
Yeah, I think so. - I'm fucking wet!
did you piss on me?
don't fucking tell me I have reporter piss on me.
Brad, they shot our fucking water cans.
we're Oscar Mike.
damn it.
40 kliks, no fucking water.
fuck it, at least you're dry.
all Victors, this is Godfather.
stand by, H&S has a truck down.
stop.
start, stop, start, stop!
Jesus!
I'm beginning to think Godfather's just a big cocktease.
they shot a hole in our fucking tire.
you guys all right? - That was some bullshit.
trigger-happy reservists. - Hey, Iceman.
can you believe those reservists? They just shot us up.
it was shock trauma.
bunch of fucking doctors.
didn't they have to take an oath or some shit against fucking people up?
you need some security while you do this.
I'll get with the Lt... - Belay that, devil dog!
godfather's gots a mission, and that mission is now.
abandon this vehicle, put your asses on another vehicle.
let's get moving. - But, - Sergeant... - No buts!
these asses ain't in gear 10 minutes ago, you's in direct disobedience of a direct order from godfather hisself!
what are you carrying? - Battalion's chow,
M-16s, ammo, 400 pounds of C-4, couple of cases of Claymore mines, all kind of shit like that.
get your bubbies in a running truck and load up right now.
you hear me?
two One, this is Hitman Two. Interrogative:
where is the turn? Over.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
it's coming right up. 100 meters. Over.
two One, it better be. I can assure you that Godfather's watching.
dude, I am so lost right now.
don't worry about it, buddy. I know where we're going.
we passed seven villages. There's one more.
do you remember the gay dog episode of "South park"?
the one where Sparky runs away 'cause he's humping all those other dogs and shit?
Yes, Ray, I...
I do remember it very well.
but I don't see what relevance this has on our present status.
there's the hamlet, our turn.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
we're making that turn now. Over.
Roger that.
nice job. Over.
do your big gay Al for me.
come on, buddy!
do it for your old pal Ray, the one who made the right turn.
well, hello there, little pup.
I'm big gay Al.
have you been outcast?
fuck yeah.
they had this gay bar open up in the town where I'm from in Michigan, and people trashed it every night.
they had to close it after a month.
see, but there's money in that, Trombley.
did I tell you I'm gonna open my own gay bar when I get back home?
it's gonna be called the golden stream. And it's gonna be like this big urinal, right?
and there's gonna be this two-way mirror that everybody pisses against.
that way when you're sitting at the bar having drinks, there's like all these big fucking giant cocks just pissing right at you.
corporal, are you a faggot?
you know what? I'm gonna franchise that shit.
you can have Michigan, Trombley.
very lucrative territory, homosexually speaking.
that's not funny, Corporal Person.
ray, give it a rest.
echo Five Charlie, this is Echo Five Echo.
Interrogative: how much further to the airfield?
echo Five Echo, I don't copy.
sergeant?
what? - I just lost my helmet.
what do you want to do, hold a funeral?
sergeant? - We ain't going back for it, Gabe.
get me General Mattis.
chaos actual, this is Godfather.
stand by for traffic. Over.
Roger. Send traffic. Over.
sir, we got Chaos on the net.
chaos, this is Godfather.
teams are out now getting eyes on the field. Break.
we'll have complete sit-rep for you within five mikes. How copy? Over.
solid copy. - Roger that. Out.
chaos is waiting.
brits are in the air.
but our u-2 surveillance picked up four possible t-72 tanks on the iraqi field.
if our eyes affirm this intel, Chaos needs to abort the british assault.
they hit the point of no return in under 30 mikes.
so where the fuck are my eyes on that field?
assassin actual, Godfather needs your sit-rep asap. Over.
Roger that. Stand by.
assassin Two Three, this is Assassin actual. How copy?
assassin, this is Assassin Two Three.
we are one klik out. 40 mikes from objective.
I say again, 4-0 mikes. Over.
Roger.
alpha is 40 mikes away from getting eyes on the field.
these guys have bitched and moaned, moaned and bitched that I haven't given them a legitimate recon mission.
I finally give them one, and they fucking fail me.
we don't have that option.
we will recon that field.
we will recon it in force.
I want the entire battalion Oscar Mike inside of 10 minutes.
sir, that's not a reconnaissance mission.
that's an assault. - Semantics.
what about the T-72s?
the violence of action is to our advantage.
I'll request that division adjust the R. O.E. accordingly.
Roger that, sir.
assassin Actual, this is Godfather.
abort that mission. R. T.B.
Interrogative: you want me to return to base?
affirmative.
all Hitman Two Gunners be advised.
alpha has a team reentering friendly lines to the north.
how copy?
get your team ready.
we're assaulting the airfield.
less than 10 mikes.
wake up.
Walt, range the Mark-19 as far out as you feel comfortable engaging targets with good effect.
what about Alpha's recon?
they're out of time.
I'm up. - They fucked it.
we're going up against tanks.
grab a diesel. Let's mount up.
it's on race. Two Two's up.
yo, man, if you have to do number one, go now, because once I start the car, I am not stopping.
naked Marine, - the Internet loves you! - Fuck you, Person.
get your ass back in the vehicle. - Where's Lilley?
we're Oscar Mike, man.
move it.
you really are gay, aren't you? - Brah I'm not cool.
this is Godfather.
godfather Actual has declared all Iraqis hostile in proximity to the objective. How copy? Over.
affirmative. Copy that.
godfather just changed the rules of engagement.
he's lowered the bar.
shit, he's removed the bar.
new R. O.E. has all Iraqis on or near that airfield declared hostile.
a free-fire zone?
I'm not passing that word.
keep this change in the R. O.E. off our net.
got any comms with those A-10s?
negative.
those jets are goddamn Air Force.
they shoot marines.
that map showed fences.
if there's fences, we'll need the bolt cutters.
they're under the reporter's seat.
can you lift your ass in a hurry if we need to get to those bolt cutters?
I think so.
you have to get out of the Humvee to open it.
I don't see a fence anyway. - Do you need them now?
Charlie just cleared a guard tower.
what is it, walt? - Fucking shit!
Mark-19's jammed.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
our mark-19 is down.
I say again, our main gun is down.
shit!
either unfuck it now or get on your fucking saw.
I'm trying.
I see men running, 200 meters, 10 o'clock.
armed? - They're something.
well, the order is everyone is declared hostile.
light 'em the fuck up.
shooting motherfuckers like it's cool.
fuck!
all right, gents, keep your heads on a swivel.
maintain your dispersion.
everybody stay on a line.
all Hitman Two Victors, maintain dispersion.
target building 500 meters ahead. Break.
Hitman Three is holding our flank. Over.
Hitman Two, this is Two One.
have two tanks, northwest side of the warehouse. Over.
this is Hitman Two. Affirmative.
they appear to be stationary. No personnel.
Hitman Two, this is Hitman Two Three.
I have an unmanned Z. P.U.-57 Tac-2.
appears to be abandoned. Over.
two Three, this is Two. Copy that.
he's got his fucking bayonet out.
doing his Rambo. - Follow my tracers!
he's shooting at scraps of metal.
can you believe that fucking retard is in charge of people?
Jesus Christ.
engage those buildings!
sir, that's more than 3, 000 meters away.
range of my fifty is 1830.
move into position.
engage! Engage!
should I light them up?
no.
we're not engaging.
those aren't military buildings.
they're civilian huts.
looks like Saddam's big bad republican guard hajis got wind I was coming.
as the great warrior-poet Ice Cube once said, "If the day does not require an A. K. "it is good.
they stick around and man those, we'd have been dead before we even saw them.
take a picture of me... - Dude, lighten up.
then again the world wouldn't have to deal with the prospect of you returning to your cretinous daughter-fucking trailer-park red-state shithole, and producing mutant, whiskey tango, scrotum-faced, bucktoothed, zit-exploding progeny.
heads up.
I need a channel to division main.
lance Corporal Trombley, channel five.
sir.
chaos, this is godfather.
send it.
be advised. We have seized the enemy airfield.
early reports are we've captured several enemy tanks and self-propelled triple-a batteries.
it appears that we've overrun the entire 255th mechanized regiment who have fled.
and sir, we've sustained zero casualties.
outstanding.
thank you.
Roger that. Out.
is that the british paratroopers? - No.
we scrubbed their mission. We got here first.
gentlemen.
we just seized an airfield.
that was pretty fucking ninja.
just keep it dry, eh?
I know they're heinous, bro. I'm living in it.
holy fuck. - Jesus!
that feels good. - Smells like dick juice.
when's the last time you took your boot off?
come on, give it a rest. - You know we can't.
they ordered us to sleep in the damn things.
got some good news...
we're so far ahead of R. C.T. 1, we'll be here a good 24 hours before they show up.
however, there is a bit of concern in some quarters about being overrun, since we don't what's around us out here, so make sure you maintain 50% watch and the comms are good.
we got pre-register on-call artillery if we want it.
sir, has any thought been given to destroying the weapons and ordinance that are sitting over there?
actually that did come up.
but it seems the battalion's supply of C-4 is now unaccounted for.
the battalion supply truck we left last night, it is a smoldering heap of twisted metal and failed hopes in the trustworthiness of the iraqis we are striving so hard to liberate.
what does that mean, sir?
it means we're on one meal a day.
I'm just saying I'm surprised is all, Brad.
I mean, aren't you surprised? - Shut the fuck up.
I mean, I'm betting that they were thinking... That they could just, you know, leave a fully-loaded supply truck laying around.
just like you could anywhere in american, you know.
I mean, you park your unlocked car in Detroit or Baltimore, I mean, your shit's gonna be there guaranteed when you get back from the day spa with your skin all exfoliated and shit, right?
I mean seriously, homes, why would our Iraqi brethren want 400 lbs of C-4, claymores and crates of M-16s? I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
wait!
they could be using all that C-4 for, like, a giant 4th of july celebration.
what do you think?
I think it's time for you to shut the fuck up.
nice job shooting those camels, Trombley.
I think I shot one of those Iraqis too.
I saw him fall.
all we saw was camels going down. - Camel killer.
look, I didn't mean to shoot innocent camels, all right?
I'm sure I shot people.
shouldn't you two be doing the after-action report on Alpha's failedrecon mission?
what's this about you losing your kevlar?
it bounced off my head, Sergeant Major, last night.
bounced off your head?
I was up on the fifty cal and the Humvee went over a berm, Sergeant Major.
that kevlar wasn't yours to lose!
that was the property of this united states Marine corps!
it belonged to every Marine!
cause of your failure to secure that helmet you've jeopardized every Marine serving today.
I was considering N. J.P. Ing your ass.
sergeant Colbert!
this is what happens when you don't enforce the grooming standards.
the mens gets all lax and then other standards fall.
devil dog here stops using his chinstrap, goes over a bump, kevlar goes flying off his head, and our protective posture...
is weakened.
Roger that, Sergeant Major.
I'm not the fucking retard who lost a whole supply truck.
gimme any target, I'll hit anything out to 700 yards.
what are they dragging?
think they want something?
one humanitarian ration for two blowjobs.
that's the going rate in this part of the world.
Stiney, give me a hand.
stop.
Hey, buddy, can you hear me?
good.
the kid's been zipped with 556.
Marines shot this kid.
fucking jackasses.
trigger-happy motherfucker.
doc, is there anything I can do? - Yeah,
Stiney, get me the battalion surgeon.
we need to cas-evac this kid or he's dead.
done.
Christeson, Stafford, two stretchers to doc, 12 o'clock.
you're a very brave kid.
he's very strong, all right?
doc? - Yeah?
he's been hit by 556.
blew out his calf muscle but there's no arterial bleeding.
he'll make it. - Roger that.
why aren't they angry?
they are grateful to be liberated and welcome the Americans as friends.
these mistakes are unavoidable in war. - Bullshit!
we're fucking recon Marines!
our whole fucking job is to observe and not make these kinds of mistakes.
and we don't fucking shoot unarmed kids.
where did this happen?
dude, they were tending their camels and shit, so who knows where it was.
fuck, man.
Trombley did this.
sir...
priority one surgical pediatric, four bullet wounds to the abdomen, 144 tach weak; 30 rest, 90 over palp. He's... stable for now.
godfather's denied the request to cas-evac the boy.
we need to cas-evac him or he's dead.
I'll go ask the battalion commander again.
thank you, sir.
shot by that asshole Trombley, Brad.
he's been zipped by 556 from Trombley's saw.
don't put this on Trombley.
I'm responsible. - Yeah?
20 other Marines drove by them and didn't shoot.
why don't we bring Trombley here to see what he's done?
don't say that. It was my order.
what can I do here?
not a fucking thing, apparently, Brad.
there's gotta be something we can do.
under the rules, we have to provide him with care until he dies.
Yeah.
well, so...
put him in my care. I'm billeted next to the battalion commander.
if he's in my care and godfather has to watch him die, he might change his order.
right, let's do this. - It's the only chance we got.
all right, on three. - Gentle.
ready, one, two, three.
ready?
let's go.
what the hell is going on here?
we brought him here to die.
get him the fuck out of here.
set him down over here. - Sergeant Major.
what the fuck is going on?
sir.
Bravo Two in rebellion.
because they thinks they shot an Iraqi child.
does he want water?
keep him still.
you're requesting that I send this wounded civilian to the R. C.T. for aid?
problem.
our tactical situation is extremely precarious here.
these are the northern most Marines' positions.
and we are 30 kliks north of them.
we are far behind enemy lines.
we have incomplete intel as to the disposition of the Iraqi units here, here and here.
we don't even know what happened to the 4, 000 troops that were at this airfield six hours ago.
and there's only 350 of us.
what can be done?
option one:
cas-evac by helicopter.
doesn't exist.
army, Marines are engaged.
taking casualties.
last night the Iraqis stopped the army advance.
they turned back 36 apache helicopters, shot a few down.
option two:
I detach a platoon and have them drive kliks through enemy lines to the shock-trauma unit here.
if any of you were a casualty right now.
I don't think I could cas-evac you.
but supposing I could,
I imagine there is some of you think we have to give wounded civilians every consideration we would give ourselves.
that is not true.
the R. O.E. say...
we have to give them the same medical care they would get by local standards.
the standards here are fucking zero.
it's a shitty situation for us, but nobody put a gun to our heads and forced us to come here.
we're all volunteers.
get me Captain Patterson.
Yes, sir.
assassin Actual, this is Godfather Five.
godfather Five, this is Assassin Actual. Send traffic.
D. X. on the net. Over.
standing by. - I'm dispatching an Alpha platoon to take this child to the shock-trauma unit.
huddle up. We're gonna talk.
this is Echo Four Charlie.
