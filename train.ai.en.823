we can take on the insurance industry.
we already have a lead plaintiff lined up.
she'd make an ideal front person for a class action.
her name's monique bryant. She's sympathetic. She has a story to tell.
it's all in the file.
all right. I'll look at it.
I truly, truly believe that this is the one.
there are people in need here. There are people we could help.
let me know what you think.
you're not even going to read it? Patty, come on.
I have a foundation to launch and I have no funding.
we have our work cut out for us.
do you have a meeting tonight?
I can cancel.
No-no-no-no, that's more important.
what's that? - This? It's personal.
so I find the guy...
just laying there. Still drunk.
so I take a few steps back, like I'm going to kick a field goal, and I kick his head right here. Right under his chin.
well, his neck snaps back.
the back of his head smacks between his shoulder blades.
and so I kick him again. Again.
over and over.
and I'm wondering, "how many kicks is it going to take before his head rips off"?
but...
I never found out 'cause I woke up.
that's very powerful, Wes.
Ellen, how about you?
have you had any dreams this week?
I can't sleep.
her fianc? was murdered a month ago. How's she supposed to sleep?
it's done.
mom?
you fell asleep.
Oh, boy...
what time is it?
almost 1: 00. Dad called.
he has to stay another week in dubai.
you going to go up to bed?
Yeah.
everything all right?
yeah... I'm fine, michael.
dad?
dad, I think someone's here.
Hey, baby.
I think someone's here.
where?
downstairs. I heard him in the living room.
what's going on?
Daniel! - Call the police.
Daniel... - Do it!
you stay the hell away from my family!
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
Daniel, he was in your office!
what were they looking for?
you hear about lily?
my god, sam, I am so sorry.
cops don't have anything else to do?
they only went after her because she's my daughter.
you're right.
the one time she tries cocaine, she gets arrested and splashed all over the front pages.
you got to help me, patty. Uh, she's just a kid.
this kind of thing could sink her for life.
what can I do?
call the da. Get him to drop the charges.
why don't you call him?
Ah, he hates me.
I refused to testify in that insider-trading thing.
look, I know that he's your friend, patty.
he'll listen to you.
look, we both know that you got me by the short and curlies.
but it's impossible for me to join your foundation right now, so if that's what it's going to take...
God, no, sam. I would never hold you hostage like that.
our kids have known each other since kindergarten.
Oh, I'll make the call, see what I can do.
thank you, patty. Thank you.
no need to thank me, sam. This is family.
sorry to interrupt.
Frobisher is at the riveredge clinic.
what room? - No... that won't help.
he's under tight security. Only his family's allowed in.
listen, ellen...
if I were you, I'd want to look him in the eye myself.
but give it time.
you'll get your shot to prosecute him.
Thanks, pete.
so, did they ever arrest the guy who shot you?
no, no. I left the police out of it.
it's complicated. I knew the guy.
anyway, I tell you, that bullet was like a wakeup call for me, rudy.
it was a correction.
silver lining, huh? Lemons into lemonade?
no, I'm serious. Man, that...
most people out there thought I was a real asshole. - Yeah?
my wife wouldn't have anything to do with me.
she filed for divorce.
took our daughter.
sent... sent my kid out west someplace.
night nurse said she called. - When?
this morning.
it says she wants to visit.
fantastic.
now I got a chance to put things right with her.
you know, maybe we could start over.
what?
I don't want her to see me like this!
I'm a goddamn cripple!
for christ's sake, I'm pissing myself!
I can't even eat solid food...
relax. Hey, come on.
you got to calm down, man.
calm down.
I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.
maybe, I tell you what. Let's not shave. Let's not shave.
and you know those tubes?
like, I know, I know I don't need them anymore, but maybe when she comes, we could stick a couple up my nose.
Yeah, let's not shave.
the alarm people called.
they're going to activate the new system tomorrow.
that's good.
you have to make a decision, Daniel. - I know.
if that company is making people sick, you have to stop them.
you think... I'm not grieving?
my concern is that clinging to david's killer is your way of clinging to david.
the type of violence you experienced could make a person retreat and collapse, or be consumed with rage.
neither one is healthy.
let me ask you something.
what do you think would make you feel better?
seeing david again.
and you know what? Ellen...
that's not going to happen.
Ellen... Ellen! Let's talk about this!
thank you, perry.
low 70s, lovely night for a walk.
I need to talk to you.
I've come because I need your help, patty. I'm in trouble.
Really? What kind of trouble?
I have information.
and I'm being threatened.
I've come because you know people who can protect me, discretely.
my family isn't safe.
Patty, my wife... my kid.
the other night, they broke in.
call the police.
I did. They filed a report.
I feel much safer now.
how is any of this my problem?
Jesus, patty, you think I want to be here?
you think I enjoy begging you for help?
if I go public with what I know, it could bring down an industry. Patty...
I don't want anything to do with you, Daniel.
you made that perfectly clear.
I respected your wishes, but now, goddamn it, I need you.
too bad.
don't you turn your back on me.
you owe me.
I owe you nothing.
another whiskey.
couple more and you'll have to change one group for another.
that's funny.
please leave me alone. I'm...
I'm done with therapy.
you made that clear.
so, you followed me?
well, it was only 15 blocks.
Yeah, well, I'm not interested.
in what?
in you and whatever bullshit line you're gonna feed me.
the only bullshit I was gonna feed you is you left that on your chair.
Thanks. Thank you.
well, it was only 15 blocks.
my girlfriend hated whiskey.
which is ironic because the guy that ran her over was shit-faced on the stuff.
you have a good night.
the guy who killed your girlfriend? - Yeah.
do you know where he is? - Attica.
but with good behavior, he'll be out march 16, 2011.
you know the date?
it's a wednesday.
I know how you're feeling.
it took me five months before I could sleep again.
what changed?
I realized something.
people like you and me-- we only have two options.
got, uh, forgiveness, revenge.
which did you choose?
neither... yet.
you take it easy, parsons.
I'm over here, patty.
Oh, quit wallowing. Stop worrying about all that.
what's done is done.
come on, patty.
a charity?
hungry children ain't gonna cut it.
you want to make amends, start by telling the truth and confess to ellen what you did to us.
Patty? - Yeah?
is everything okay?
Yeah, just fine.
actually...
we need to talk.
sure. Fire away.
not in the office.
it's, um...
it's personal.
okay.
if you're not busy friday after the gala, there's a little place near the waldorf I'd love to have a drink.
look forward to it.
can you give me the headlines?
it's about you and the frobisher case.
I didn't explain everything that happened.
okay.
I want to wear a wire.
this is a big step.
you do this, you become a cooperating witness.
we can't keep your name confidential.
you'll have to appear in court.
testify against her.
I'm fine with that.
Ellen, there is no reason to jump the gun.
she wants to talk to me about the frobisher case.
you don't want to hear it?
what, uh, what exactly did she say?
she said she didn't explain everything that happened.
I told you she tried to kill me.
her guilt is eating at her.
how do you know that?
I can see it.
she's not in a good place.
when is the meeting? - Friday after the gala.
where? - A restaurant in midtown.
all right.
it's what we signed you up for.
it's time, mr. Purcell.
you ready to be reasonable?
did you find anything interesting?
Yeah, very.
at least the parts I could understand.
Purcell was doing some sort of chemical analysis.
get this to our guy at columbia. - Will do.
yeah? Thanks. Send him up.
it's sam arsenault.
so, where are you on the charity foundation?
nowhere.
without arsenault's money, there is no foundation.
your visit's gonna do him a world of good.
his painkillers are pretty strong.
but he's going to do just fine.
he'll be happy to see you when he wakes up, mrs. Frobisher.
baby.
people like you and me-- we only have two options.
forgiveness. Revenge.
it's time for his lunch. Mrs. Frobisher, you could sit with him if you...
Mrs. Frobisher?
Mr. Frobisher?
is she here yet?
so, despite your best efforts, the da wouldn't drop the charges.
can you believe it?
if lily's name wasn't arsenault, this never would've happened.
you're goddamn right.
she was set up.
what happened to your campaign?
republican chairman sees lily on the news, dumps me, decides to back another horse.
Oh, sam.
look, patty, uh...
it's hard for me to ask, but, um, I want back in.
to my foundation?
I know, it's embarrassing.
I'm standing here with my pants down around my ankles.
but I've always been a big fan of the cause, you know that.
and after lily, I could sure use the pr.
we'd be happy to take your money, sam, but I've promised away the naming rights.
it can't be the arsenault-hewes foundation?
Patty, I want my name up there.
I wish I could help you.
come on.
there's gotta be something i could do.
HEWES/ARSENAULT CHILDREN'S HUNGER INTIATIVE
I will be eternally grateful to patty hewes.
no, no. Sam is the real hero here.
at the last moment, he generously decided to double our endowment.
well, I'm thrilled that I can make a difference with just the stroke of a pen.
Hey, mom.
look at that guy.
he's out here celebrating and his daughter's being sent to juvie.
such a shame about lily.
I told you she was a cokehead.
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
God help you if I ever find out you're doing anything like that.
I tried it, mom. Coke's not my thing.
Patty, congratulations. - Thank you.
incredible evening. Oh, it's amazing.
well...
so now that you've launched this, uh, maybe we can...
take a case?
it's just a thought.
I like Ellen's infant mortality case.
that is just the kind of cause that we should be advancing.
well, then, let's do it.
set up a meeting with the plaintiff tomorrow.
fantastic.
nice find, Ellen. It's a great case.
I'm glad you think so.
Daniel, I had no idea you were here tonight.
an important cause like this, we didn't want to miss it.
I don't believe you know my wife christine.
Christine, come say hi!
uh, will you excuse me? I really should go say hi.
um, two minutes and we'll go, okay?
it's really nice to meet you.
I admire your work so much.
thank you for your support.
she's lovely.
listen, patty. I'm sorry about the other night.
I don't want to drag you into this.
I can handle it myself.
glad to hear it.
I should really get those materials back from you.
I'll have them messengered over to your office tomorrow.
better to send them to my home.
Daniel, come say hello.
I promise you-- you never have to see me.
Jesus!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
what, you're stalking me now?
no. You just didn't come back to group.
Yeah, that's kind of what I had in mind when I quit.
what do you want from me?
I don't want anything. I... nothing. I don't...
I was just concerned.
and, and, look, I-I-I thought this might help you.
what's that?
it's a phone number. Don't worry; it's not mine.
call after midnight. Just ask for frank.
but if a woman answers, you should hang up.
I don't do drugs.
well, that's good 'cause he doesn't sell any.
and they're bad for you.
well, then, what am I calling him for?
because frank's not the kind of guy who gets hung up on permits.
a permit? For what?
a gun. - A gun?
you know what...
what. what the hell would make you think that I want a gun?
because I think you're scared.
because I think you feel helpless and alone.
now, if you tell me I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.
and I apologize-- my mistake.
I've been thinking about this whole revenge thing.
yeah?
it's not me. It's not who I am.
a gun's not gonna help, so I guess I'm just gonna have to find a way to forgive.
it functions like a normal telephone, but there's a microphone right here.
to activate it, you just turn it on.
think I can handle that.
it records in and out of the case, but out is better if you can manage it.
you don't want to talk too much.
that's the biggest mistake people make. When they get nervous, they talk.
if patty's gonna give us anything, we don't want you speaking over her, so you can prompt her with questions, but then you got to back off and you let her talk.
I got it. - You ready?
I'm fine. You guys are more nervous than I am.
okay.
this is agent randall harrison.
the date is june 14. The time is 11: 27 P. M.
Ellen parsons, do you give your voluntary consent to have this recording device placed on your person?
Yes.
well, sorry about that. Fox news.
Oh, you... you've got another bottle?
what is it?
I just picked the most expensive one on the list.
so, you wanted to tell me something.
Ellen, I didn't explain everything to you during the frobisher case.
that's all in the past.
no, no, it's important that you know this.
Patty, I think we both need to move on.
the frobisher case was chaos, and we weren't thinking clearly.
still, I... I want to apologize.
apologize? Apologize for what?
the weekend after fiske committed suicide, his death had a profound effect on me.
it, um, pushed me to a place that I had never to been before.
I didn't know that.
I... I became too emotional.
I was afraid of being exposed, of losing the case.
I lost control.
I had to leave the city.
while I'm gone, you're welcome to stay here.
Ellen... everything's gonna be all right.
you said you went to visit family.
well, that wasn't exactly true.
no?
years ago, I had a child.
I've never told anyone.
the baby, was, um, unhealthy.
the doctors said it was, stillborn. It was a little girl.
I named her Julia.
sometimes, I think, if she'd lived...
I'd be another person.
so, when you went away, you...
I went to visit her.
I hadn't been to that cemetery in 30 years.
and while I was there, someone attacked you in my apartment.
whoever broke in was looking for me.
it's done.
I wish to god it had been me.
I want you to know that if my daughter had survived
if Julia had lived
I'd want her to be just like you.
how did it go?
Hello? This is she.
I was wrong.
I didn't get anything.
it's just more lies.
what did she say?
she told me someone was coming to kill her that night and some bullshit about me being the daughter she never had.
well, you're building a relationship, establishing intimacy.
these things take time.
I don't have time.
miss hewes? - Yes.
this way, please. - Thank you.
now will you help me?
the important thing is she took the infant mortality case.
where are we on that?
Patty's meeting the lead plaintiff tomorrow.
good.
we'll get her, Ellen.
how long do these things usually take?
could be two, three years before we have enough.
you got to be patient.
can you do that?
6 MONTHS LATER
so, it's just the two of us.
face to face.
it seems like you're not gonna tell me the truth after all.
well, that's okay.
I lied, too.
the bureau's putting together a case we'll want Patty to take.
we're gonna need you to pitch it to her.
Ellen brought this in.
a grand slam.
infant mortality.
how are you gonna use this to arrest Patty?
first, you get her to bite, and then we'll fill you in on the rest.
Ellen's in counseling three or four times a week.
people like you and me...
we only have two options: Forgiveness, revenge.
let me use the firm's resources to prove that Frobisher had David killed.
if that company is making people sick, you have to stop them.
this ends today.
this was hand-delivered. No return address.
why did you send this to me?
you're the only one I can trust.
if I go public with what I know, it could bring down an industry.
I don't believe you know my wife, Christine.
you ready to be reasonable?
now, will you help me?
so, it seems like you're not gonna tell me the truth after all.
well, that's okay.
I lied, too.
6 MONTHS EARLIER
it's Patty.
Hello? Is everything okay?
no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I need you, uh... there's been an emergency.
of course.
she wants me to meet her at her office.
at this hour? Why?
I have no idea.
you all right?
I'm fine, yeah. I just needed some water.
miss Hewes, you're an attorney, aren't you? - Yes.
are you mr. Purcell's attorney? - No.
do you have any idea why he'd ask us to call you tonight?
well, I saw him earlier at a charity event.
that's probably why he thought of me.
excuse me.
I would like to ask both of you a few more questions. - All right.
what time did you, um, drop off your wife?
I told you. It must have been midnight or so.
I-I can't be sure.
I had to drop her off because it's a one-way street, and when I came back, I saw that the...
that the... the door of the house was locked.
that's not like Christine.
and so, then, what happened when you went inside?
I called her name.
and that's when the guy ran past me.
he slammed me up against the door, and he-he-he...
took off outside.
is that how you hurt your head?
it must have been.
well, had you ever seen this man before?
no, never.
but like I said, he was shorter than me.
blonde, stringy hair. Aryan or nordic.
he must have seen my wife walking alone and followed her.
I ran off after him, but he... too far ahead.
I was worried about Christine, so I came rushing back.
that's when I...
right, and that's when you called 911? - Yeah.
can you think of anyone who would want to hurt you or your family?
no.
it's time, mr. Purcell.
you ready to be reasonable?
any grievances or threats that you're aware of? - None.
I've come because i need your help, Patty.
I'm in trouble. I'm being threatened.
Oh, jesus.
Jesus, jesus! Christine.
I'm okay. No, no, I'm okay.
he can't have gotten far.
what the hell are you all doing standing around?
we have patrols canvassing the neighborhood with your description.
where the hell is he? I need candy.
no, you need to sit down, Daniel.
you want me to find him myself? - He's diabetic.
can somebody please get some orange juice for mr. Purcell?
anything else you can remember?
all right, detective, we have to finish this later.
I'm advising mr. Purcell not to answer any more questions.
I thought you said you weren't his attorney.
I am now.
did you ask for this? - You got juice? All right, all right.
let's get you to my office.
drink this. It's orange juice. Okay, can you hold it?
there you are. There you are, okay.
he has a daughter who's staying with her grandparents upstate.
we're gonna need a team there as well.
I'll get you the address.
no, he'll be staying under an alias. - How are we on security?
uh, well, on the way.
what about a hotel suite?
I booked him into the Wooster, and I leaked to a beat reporter he's headed to the waldorf.
good. This is purcell's doctor. Wake him up.
get him over to the hotel.
okay, fine, but Patty, I'm not sure what we're doing here.
Purcell doesn't need us.
he needs a criminal defense attorney.
this isn't something I can hand off to another lawyer.
and Patty, the lead plaintiff from the infant mortality case is coming in to meet with you tomorrow.
I can't deal with that right now.
it's okay. I'll reschedule. I'll buy us some time.
no, no. Don't reschedule. Work has to go on.
why don't you take first chair on the case? - Sure...
if you think that's the best approach, given the circumstances.
well, it's time for you to take lead. You don't need me. Go for it.
we're moving you to a hotel.
I have to call my daughter.
the paramedics gave you a sedative.
I think it would be better to wait until tomorrow.
here.
I know this is a difficult time, but we have to talk.
the detectives will want to interview you again in the morning, and we need to get some things straight.
why did you lie to the police?
you didn't tell them about the threats.
you came to me, fearing for your life, for your family.
they don't need to know that.
why the hell not?
I don't think you realize what's going on here.
you were found alone in your house with your wife's body.
there's no sign of forced entry, and you lied to the police.
I am going to be a suspect.
you're the spouse.
you're gonna be the suspect.
Patty, I saw the guy who did it.
who's he working for?
who's behind this, Daniel?
I can't talk anymore, Patty.
Patty? - Yeah?
the car is here. - Okay.
all right.
let's get you to the hotel.
this way, ma'am.
right this way. Watch your step.
how did it go last night with mr. Purcell?
fine. Uh, when I left, the security guards were posted at his door like you asked.
can you close that for a moment?
do you think he killed his wife?
I think it's best not to jump to conclusions.
but you know him. Do you think he's even capable of something like that?
I think anyone is capable of anything.
well, criminal law isn't my strong suit, but I'm willing to help any way I can.
thank you.
Oh, Patty?
the infant mortality case... I'm concerned.
the plaintiff might go to another firm.
she wants you to represent her.
you are the client liaison.
back up Tom and make sure the plaintiff feels supported by the entire firm.
and Patty gave the infant mortality case to Tom Shayes? - Yeah.
so what is Patty's interest in this murder?
I think danny purcell and her are friends.
I saw him and his wife at her charity gala last night.
well, this is not what we wanted. - I know.
is there value to targeting Shayes?
he's been Patty's second for years.
I know he's got heaps of stuff on her.
you want to do this? - All right.
so change of plan.
we'll let Tom take the case.
if this pans out, we'll see if we can flip him.
use him to get to Patty.
Ellen, are you all right with that?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
this is going to destroy Tom's career.
and he could be looking at jail time.
Tom's a big boy.
if he wants to break the law, then he can pay the price.
former Billionaire - Take care. - I'll see you next week.
take it easy. I'll see you next week.
take it easy, man.
how's group?
are you kidding? It was fantastic. So fun.
it's the only place where I knew I could find you.
do you have a minute? - Sure.
so what's on your mind?
my...
I had the chance.
what chance?
to kill him.
the guy who murdered your fianc?
we were alone in his hospital room.
it was just the two of us.
it would have been so easy.
but I couldn't do it.
why was he in the hospital? - It doesn't matter.
the point is that I thought I was there for my fianc?
but I realized getting revenge is something that he wouldn't want me to do.
and now I just feel like I blew it.
then go back to the hospital.
I can't. It's too late.
they guy has been released, and I have no idea where he is.
Parsons, if you really want to find someone, there's always a way.
anyway, I just-- I had to tell someone and you were... the only person who i could think of.
6 MONTHS LATER
Hello?
ten minutes? - What?
okay.
I've got to go.
do you always have to go?
I told you there are things in my life that I can't talk about.
who was that?
leave it, wes.
seriously, who was that?
don't be here when I get back.
I have to get to the country house, Patty. I need to tell erica.
well, this won't take very long.
it's very important.
sending you the files was a mistake.
what are they?
our firm was hired to do toxicity studies on a chemical compound.
the compound's being developed commercially under the name aracite.
is it toxic?
extremely.
what is it used for?
well, they don't tell me that.
Daniel, you're vice president of your firm, you're head of research.
the firm is obligated to maintain its client's confidentiality, even from the researchers.
I get raw data.
I run tests and I analyze the results.
so you issued your report...
and whoever commissioned it pressured my firm to doctor the results.
the firm caved, but they kept my name on the report!
Daniel, do you think your firm killed Christine?
they warned me to keep my mouth shut.
but they're not big enough to be calling the shots.
who would commission a report like this?
we consult for the energy industry.
these companies are worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
any one of them could've had an interest in my work.
now you understand why I can't go public?
I understand why you're afraid.
I'm not going to the police with this information.
that may be the only way to keep you out of prison.
I don't care.
I was stupid once...
now, I have a daughter to protect.
what do you want me to do with this?
burn it. Shred it, I don't care.
if it ever comes to light, I'll deny every word of it.
thank you, Patty. I'll call you when I get to the country.
all right.
Michael. - Hey, mom.
you okay? - Oh, I'm fine.
Michael, this is Daniel Purcell.
it's good to meet you.
Yeah, same.
I'll be in touch, Daniel.
I know you were expecting ms. Hewes, Monique, but Tom is Patty's partner.
you couldn't be in better hands.
I assure you, ms. Bryant.
all of the firm's resources will be at your disposal.
the insurance companies need to be held accountable.
they will be. I promise you.
we're going to fight for all those women.
but you are going to be the face of this class action.
we couldn't hope for a better representative.
thank you. - Sure, thank you.
Oh, thank you.
could I have a moment alone, mr. Shayes?
certainly. Yeah.
I work two jobs, mr. Shayes.
it would just help so much if I could get a little something up front.
a little extra to help pay the bills.
Monique, that kind of transaction is, uh...
unethical. It's against the law, actually.
the settlement is going to be tens of millions, right?
that may very well be.
but in the eyes of the court, you'd be getting more money than the other plaintiffs in this suit.
it's, uh, it's illegal.
I, I really do want to go with your firm, mr. Shayes, but...
but...
I've been approached by other attorneys.
they said they'd be able to help me out.
how much are we talking here?
$60, 000 would be a godsend.
well, I think we could manage that.
how soon?
give me 72 hours.
he said "yes."
it's never a "yes" until they actually make the payoff.
so what are your instincts? You think he's going to follow through?
seemed ready to go.
has he ever done anything like this before?
I don't know.
well, go about your business.
agent Hawkins will schedule another meeting.
and, uh, we'll see.
put some dirt underneath that.
she wanted to plant it for her mother.
I've spoken to the police.
there's still no evidence that anyone else was in your house that night.
Yeah, of course not.
Daniel, if you get arrested, you're going to need a defense attorney, and this whole thing will be out of my hands, but if you let me pursue that report...
no.
Patty, we had this conversation.
well, eventually, you're going to have to sit down with detective huntley.
any time he wants.
he's going to try to poke holes in your story.
I can't help you unless you tell me absolutely everything.
what do you want to know?
start with your private life.
did you and Christine have any financial issues, any debts?
a mortgage. That's all.
any drug problems? Gambling problems? - No.
were you having an affair? - Jesus, Patty.
I know this is unpleasant, but believe me, it's gonna get a lot worse.
were you having an affair?
no.
was Christine?
none that I know of.
were there any other problems with your marriage?
nothing out of the ordinary.
define ordinary.
ordinary. Ordinary means ordinary.
did you ever hit Christine?
enough of this horse shit! What are we talking about here?
your temper.
we both know you have one.
I never hit her, and I didn't kill her.
well, I can't prove that unless you allow me to pursue who's actually behind this.
don't you get it?
none of this matters.
we're never gonna find out who's actually behind this.
don't saturate the center now.
make sure you soak the periphery, as well.
surprised to hear from you, Patty.
last we saw each other, we were on opposite sides of a courtroom.
we haven't always seen always see eye to eye, but i called you because you're the sharpest guy at the epa.
I got to ask you something, Patty.
how in god's name did you get your hands on those documents?
you know I can't answer that.
can you explain them?
well, they're definitely toxicity studies.
aracite seems to be an industrial compound, but since it's newly developed, finding out its exact purpose is going to be next to impossible.
why is that?
some company has spent millions of dollars to develop it.
they're going to keep a tight lid on its uses.
I wouldn't ask if it weren't important, Earl.
look, let me talk to some of my colleagues in the field.
I need you to be discreet.
of course.
thanks for the heads-up, Earl.
I don't know where Patty Hewes got this information.
I'm afraid somebody in your company may have leaked it.
we'll certainly look into it.
these are just copies, you know. Patty Hewes still has the originals.
I understand.
I can't tell you how much we appreciate the tip.
you know how I feel, Wayne.
a good relationship with the energy industry is the best way to promote a healthy environment.
will I see you up at winged foot next month?
been working on my short game all summer.
hundred bucks a hole, then?
know better than to give your money away like that, Wayne.
Yeah. - Yes, mr. Suttry.
get me a meeting with claire Maddox.
it's urgent. - Right away.
you wanted to see me?
what is this? - A photograph.
turns out, someone we know has been keeping a secret.
a sonogram?
it's a boy.
you're pregnant? - Yeah.
don't tell deb, though, cause I'm supposed to be on the pill.
Congratulations! - Thank you. Thank you.
how is shayes doing?
any unusual behavior? Does he seem nervous, jumpy?
no, no. He's on top of the world.
he and his wife are having a baby.
Oh, shit! Sorry. Sorry.
Pam, you can't do this.
no. No, you... not on this number. No.
goddamn it! You take this. Pam...
all day long with with this bullshit.
his wife's leaving him.
is Tom's meeting with the plaintiff set?
Yeah, it's ready to go.
Hey, Ellen, if you're having second thoughts, we can talk.
just use him to get to Patty, and I'll be fine.
I've been sitting out there for half an hour.
in the future, don't demand a day-of meeting to clean up another shit storm that you should have been competent enough to keep from exploding out of your own ass.
what is it this time?
we have a containment problem.
it's a legal issue.
it's out of my domain.
by all means, share.
one of my employees leaked some data.
the documents are extremely... sensitive.
does mr. Kendrick know?
Mr. Kendrick doesn't need to know.
not if you do your job.
well, one of us certainly should.
who has the documents?
I've been thinking about you, Ellen.
you're braver than I thought.
you didn't tell me it was him.
it wasn't.
come on. Arthur Frobisher had your fianc killed, didn't he?
no, he didn't. Okay? Just... it's not like that.
you said in group you were a lawyer.
you spent half a year working on a big case.
there was a $2 billion settlement.
and then you went and visited the guy in the hospital.
please leave it alone.
listen to me.
you do not mess with a guy like this.
your firm destroyed him.
when he recovers, a guy with this kind of power is gonna be vindictive.
and he has resources. He has connections.
and trust me, Ellen. I don't care what he did.
you have to forget about him.
you understand?
Thanks, Tom.
I hope you know what you're doing.
I do.
6 MONTHS EARLIER
come in.
this Daniel Purcell thing makes no sense.
it's one of Patty's crusades.
do you know what's really going on there?
no idea.
are we turning into a criminal defense firm?
I mean, that's not what I signed up for.
stick with me on the infant mortality case.
I was hoping you would say that.
well, you did a terrific job of hiding it.
how old is Megan now?
uh, she's, uh... she's 12.
if she wanted to be a lawyer, would you let her?
it's too late.
she wanted to be the first woman supreme court justice.
she didn't realize that daddy already clerked for one.
I think kids have got a really basic sense of justice. Don't you?
and then, as we get older, it just gets all screwed up.
I don't think so.
I think you get older, y-you realize that the world is unfair and that, uh, mommy and daddy can't make everything okay.
if you want justice, you got to fight and claw and, and do whatever you have to...
to get it.
you've been working for Patty way too long.
it's a good thing you bugged the office.
there's something on one of the tapes from last week I need you to hear.
it was recorded in the conference room.
but I've been approached by other attorneys who said they would be able to help me out.
how much are we talking here?
$60, 000 would be a godsend.
well, I think we could manage that.
how soon?
give me 72 hours.
he's already scheduled a payoff.
I wouldn't have expected that.
you going to let him go through with it?
it would be a very big case for the firm.
it could also put you at risk.
remember, we got to hear a dollar amount.
it can come from you, but shayes has got to confirm it.
copy that.
you want to put that thing away?
what difference does it make?
put it away.
here he comes.
thank you for coming, mr. Shayes.
it's good to see you, Monique.
I feel terrible asking you to do this, but $60, 000 is going to save my life.
well, I'm, uh, happy to help.
Mr. Shayes?
come on, Tommy.
it's the case of a lifetime, come on.
I'm going to give you this, but it's imperative that you understand you can never talk about this.
Mr. Shayes, I'm ashamed to even ask you for it.
Hey, uh, now's not a good time.
who the hell is calling him?
hold, hold on a second.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
um, I've got to take this and, uh...
he's going to walk.
I'll be in touch with you, Monique. Thank you.
shit.
don't take the infant mortality case.
I need your help with Purcell.
it's not just a murder, Tom.
there's a much bigger case here.
I can't wait to hear the details.
game!
Claire, you see me beat this geezer?
Congratulations.
you have a nice, compact stroke there, your honor.
Aw, you're just sweet-talking me.
did you bring the motion?
it's a replevin action.
I'm seeking preliminary relief for the immediate seizure of property.
Yes, your honor, because if the other side knew I was here, they would destroy the very files I'm seeking to recover.
well, I'm gonna need some time to look this over.
Patty Hewes & associates?
this is who you're up against?
now is not the time for personal animus, your honor.
take all the time you need.
give me the goddamn pen.
thank you.
excuse me. - Hey, you can't go in there!
what's that? - A court order.
Hewes & associates is in possession of stolen documents.
there are two ways this can go, ms. Hewes.
you hand them over to us willingly or we turn this place upside down till we find them.
what's up?
just doing some background on the infant mortality case.
Oh, I'm not taking it.
why not? What happened?
Monique Bryant wanted money up front.
are you serious?
$60, 000 before she'd sign a retainer.
what did you say?
I-I told her forget it.
I'm not that kind of lawyer.
don't worry, I didn't tell Patty.
I know you're the one who brought the client in, so...
thank you, tha-- I, I am so sorry.
this was a really big opportunity for you.
Yeah, it's okay.
it turns out Patty changed her mind, didn't want me to take the case anyway, so...
uh, did she say why?
Why? Uh, because she's Patty.
if you figure her out, let me know.
you screwed me, Patty.
you gave earl jacoby a copy of my work?
he was appointed by the oil industry.
Jacoby's in the pocket of big energy! - Think.
I wanted jacoby to leak the information.
you what?
it was the only way to expose who commissioned the aracite report.
do you know this name?
Claire Maddox. I've heard of her.
she's head counsel of the world's third largest energy provider.
Ultima national resources? - Yeah.
so they commissioned the report? - Yeah.
and they killed Christine.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
come in.
Hey, I'm taking off.
just wanted to check on you before I left.
I'm fine, Ellen, thank you.
how's mr. Purcell holding up?
not too well, which is to be expected.
did you hear what happened with Tom's plaintiff?
no.
she wanted a payoff.
Really? How much?
60 grand. Tom turned her down.
of course he did.
I want him helping me with Purcell anyway.
you were the one who brought in that case, weren't you?
a woman in grief counseling referred monique bryant to me.
and you didn't suspect anything?
she lost a daughter and a granddaughter.
Monique was devastated.
well, you have to be careful, Ellen.
everyone is looking to play an angle.
did you tell anyone about us?
no.
unr's lead counsel was defending a prostitute on drug charges.
she was with an energy trader-- finn garrety.
Kendrick could be using him to
the trade went through.
all right.
does finn know a guy by the name of walter kendrick?
I-I don't know.
can you try and find out?
I'll see what I can do.
the stock will rise, the case will vanish. Invest in unr, phil.
I want to take a position in unr.
we both know what's going on here.
I don't want to dance around it anymore.
let's have dinner or something.
okay.
maybe I should take you off this thing.
she'll come to me.
if parsons isn't talking, you'll have to try someone else.
who? - Katie connor.
I'm agent harrison. This is agent werner. We're with the fbi.
Pete swallowed a bottle of his wife's meds so that he wouldn't have to give us evidence on patty.
what did the feds ask you for?
if I don't give 'em enough to put you in jail, they're putting me there.
you give them whatever you need to.
Patty, I called the hospital to check in on pete.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I was wrong. I don't think patty had pete killed.
why not?
she seems genuinely thrown by his death.
she believes that he arranged it himself to protect her.
well, if it wasn't patty, then who did it?
I don't know, but she blames you guys.
this is like a call to war for her.
meaning what?
meaning you're not just targeting her now.
she's targeting you.
the firm is being investigated by the fbi?
I'm afraid so.
how do you know?
they came to me.
they asked me to inform on patty.
I turned 'em down.
then they went to pete.
is that why he...
he didn't want to give up anything that could hurt us.
Jesus.
so now we have to circle the wagons.
has anyone approached you?
of course not.
no unusual overtures?
I would have told you.
when were you going to tell me?
I'm telling you now.
I'm sorry, mr. Shayes.
I have to see patty.
you're not allowed in here.
well, it's, it's urgent.
I have strict orders from ms. Hewes.
believe me, she's going to want to hear what i have to say.
sir, you're not allowed in the building anymore.
let's do this the easy way.
well, uh, tell patty that I tried to warn her.
and let her know that I'm filing a suit against her for, for wrongful termination!
hope you know what you're doing.
I do.
Ellen, don'T.
it's not who you are.
energy secretary has a heart attack at his own wedding.
pathetic.
it was going to be his third marriage. He knew what he was doing.
where are they on replacing him at the department of energy?
I'm on the president's search committee.
we're just beginning to look.
in this climate, we're likely to get some regulation crusader who thinks he's another goddamn eliot ness.
use your pull. Install an ally.
I plan to.
in the meantime, I want to step up the frequency of our transactions.
there's only so many times we're going to be able to pull this off before someone notices.
you're not getting cold feet, are you, walt?
no, dave.
good. Then get the information to my trader.
we're being investigated by the fbi, and you didn't tell me?
Tom... - You had no right to withhold that.
this isn't just about you, patty. I'm a partner here. I'm vulnerable, too.
Yes, you are, so just calm down, and we'll figure out what we're going to do about this.
who can you talk to that has an in at the bureau?
no one. I can't risk exposing myself.
then I'll make a call because we need information.
what's up?
last time I saw that face, you were 18 and thought you got your prom date pregnant.
it's about patty, isn't it?
I think the firm's under investigation.
under investigation by who?
the fbi. - For what?
I have no idea.
I told you you should have cut and run after the frobisher case.
look, I-I know your feelings about patty and her legal ethics.
so let me guess.
you want me to use my contacts to get you information about the investigation.
I need to know what they have on patty.
I am an assistant U. S.Attorney.
what you're asking is totally inappropriate.
please. It's my, it's my career.
I can't believe you're putting me in this position.
look, I don't know what to say. You're my sister.
I need your help.
fine. I'll see what I can find out.
Mr. Garrety, thank you for coming.
you got a real nice club here.
thank you, have a seat.
there's a new itinerary.
we going on another trip? Same car?
you'll be contacted with new codes. We're going to try another location.
they have something salty around here? Maybe some nuts?
I'm sure we can accommodate you.
better yet, maybe some of the chinese mix with the wasabi peas.
certainly.
first, though, how are your meetings going?
my meetings?
Oh, you mean for the... going great.
I totally kicked the stuff.
and the girl?
she's history, too.
these are smart moves, mr. Garrety, because if you want me to ensure your continued fiscal success, you won't ever make another mess for me again.
if you know another trader who can do what I do, mr. Pell, use him.
otherwise, stay out of my face.
forget about the nuts.
better not miss.
she should be so lucky.
you miss this and i run the table.
we'll see about that.
you are a terrible pool player.
maybe that's just what I want you to think.
the hustle began hours ago. You just didn't notice it.
is that so?
first I invite myself to girls' night out.
I throw a game or two, and before you know it, the gouging starts and you lose your shirts.
I can't wait.
or maybe I am just a terrible pool player.
here. I'm gonna get a club soda. You want anything?
no, I'm good.
laying off the sauce. Smart.
you want to stay sharp while i mount my comeback.
Yeah, good luck with that.
sorry I'm a third wheel. I hope you don't mind.
no. No, it's fine.
how you doing?
I'm fine.
look, about this dinner party we're hosting...
what about it?
my instinct is to cancel, but it might be nice for you to have some friends around.
that's fine.
do they know how uncle pete died?
the hospital is still investigating.
but you think he killed himself.
or had someone help him.
Pete was trying to protect me.
look at me.
what? - Drop the unr case.
I can't do that.
you've confirmed the fbi is targeting you.
Yes, and as far as I'm concerned, they killed uncle pete.
they're trying to intimidate me.
they want me to back down.
this is about power protecting itself.
I threaten them, and they hate me for it.
who's they?
the fbi, the government, walter kendrick and unr-- they're all the same.
you're being paranoid.
they're closing in on me, phil. They approached ellen, they approached pete.
and look what happened.
Patty, stop.
please stop.
no. I'm not going to let them get away with it.
so, you, uh, wanted to see me? - Yeah.
I'm concerned about what's going on between you and wes.
what's going on?
I can see in group that the two of you are getting... close?
I think maybe you should come to different sessions from now on.
I've also spoken to wes.
and what did he say?
he agreed.
it's not healthy, ellen.
you think it's too soon after david?
I think you and wes may be filling a need for each other that's based on grief.
what's wrong with that?
it can be emotionally dangerous.
so can loneliness.
but jumping into a relationship just to fill the loneliness won't help.
you want my advice?
Absolutely.
you know I value your opinion.
energy is not my field. I'm not sure I know anyone who's even qualified.
since when has that been necessary for a government appointment?
right.
this is a cabinet position.
I don't need an expert. I need someone who's going to support the industry.
well, that's a tall order.
I mean, given the mood in washington, there's no way the senate's going to confirm anyone who's not pro-regulation.
true.
but if I know you, that's not what you want.
you're looking for someone who reads interventionist, but who has a free market heart.
see?
that's why I came to you.
have you thought about sam arsenault?
Ah, word is, he's a bit unpredictable.
started as an independent, then tried to get the republicans to back him for governor.
trust me, sam arsenault's only real loyalty is to the capitalist party.
we're going to have a little dinner party on friday night.
if I can get arsenault to be there, do you want to meet him?
you're tense. Relax. Relax. Breathe. That's it.
it's firm, not tight.
it feels like i won't be able to control it.
you try to control it too much, you get stiff and lose accuracy.
keep breathing.
how's that? - Feels good.
let her rip.
I see it, but I don't believe it.
believe it, cowboy. - Hang it in your office.
I think you'll find people will treat you a little nicer.
that is a very good idea.
better to be feared than respected.
thanks for helping me.
Ellen, I owe you an apology.
for what?
a couple weeks ago, i shouldn't have asked you out.
Oh, don't worry about that.
no. I pushed you. It was wrong.
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
I think we both know that you and I shouldn't get involved.
the way we met, therapy.
you agree, right? - Yeah.
yeah? - Yeah.
good. Me, too, because I was, um...
this is awkward.
I was wondering if I could ask out your friend.
Katie? - If it's okay.
Yeah. - Yeah, we had fun the other night, and...
Yeah, of course. I'll give you her number.
I haven't met with katie connor alone yet.
I got nothing to report.
I got something else for you.
what am I supposed to do with these?
deliver them to jersey. The address is in the glove compartment.
no. No, no.
did you just say no?
I agreed to do this thing with ellen parsons, but i am done with this other shit.
no.
you're done when I say you are.
make sure the tank's full when you bring it back.
Thanks, baby. - Your dealer is a creep.
Yeah, but his shit's good.
you want?
no. I'm getting clean for my kid.
that's very sweet.
but what's going on with that lawyer who was asking about me?
nothing. He keeps calling, and I keep blowing him off.
good girl.
this ever traces back to me, I will be disbarred.
so will I. Mutually assured destruction.
I requisitioned the fbi file on hewes & associates.
what do they have on patty?
Tom, there was no file.
what do you mean?
it means, there's no official file on patty hewes or her firm.
was it classified? - No.
even if it were, there would still be a file.
it would be off-limits, but there would be a record the investigation existed.
was there anything on pete mckee? - No.
nothing on anybody involved with hewes & associates, including you.
I don't get it.
the fbi approached one of our associates.
uncle pete killed himself so the government couldn't use him against patty.
I don't know what to tell you. There's no investigation.
no file? That doesn't make any sense.
the guys who approached you-- you sure they were legit?
Yeah. They were fbi.
you're sure? - Absolutely.
are you sure you can trust your sister?
she wouldn't have told me unless she were 100%.
what the hell is going on?
what is really going on with this investigation?
what do you mean?
the fbi has no file on patty hewes, tom shayes, or on me.
who told you that?
I have my sources.
you need to tell us where you heard that.
why the hell is there no record of this investigation?
do we tell her?
I think it's time she knew the truth.
we don't work for the fbi, ellen.
who do you work for?
the ipf. - The what?
inter-planetary federation?
you never saw men in black?
Oh, you guys are jackasses.
Ellen, listen.
we know patty has contacts at the justice department.
we had to pull the file.
we couldn't risk letting anyone tip her off.
you understand?
you'd better be telling me the truth.
well, she's resourceful.
Yeah, I get that, but I don't like her.
question is, can we trust her intel?
can we?
coming.
Ugh, relax, will ya?
new clients are always impatient.
who are you?
my name's patty.
the attorney you've been talking to is a partner in my firm.
you stopped returning his calls.
what do you want?
I'd like an explanation of what happened the night you and finn garrety were arrested.
who are you calling? - My agency. You have to leave.
well, in that case, I'll just call finn.
let him know you see other clients.
go ahead. He won't care. - No?
he doesn't think you're exclusive?
we're on the same side here. All I want to do is talk.
you gonna pay for the hour?
I've looked into you.
I know you're trying to put yourself through school.
you also have a failed marriage, two stints in rehab, a kid you never see, and you're in one hell of a custody battle.
now, if you come in and talk to us, I will pay for your tuition in night school.
I will give you protection, and I'll put in a good word with your family court judge.
and if I don't talk to you?
family courts don't take kindly to mothers who are prostitutes.
it would be a shame if they found out.
Dave, great to see you.
glad you could make it. - Thank you.
it doesn't really matter if the economy tanks, as long as people need doctors, medical malpractice attorneys will have work.
doesn't say much for the state of health care.
you shouldn't be telling him this.
I'm going in for a simple hernia surgery next week.
Oh, yeah, they're all simple until they're not.
thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, sport. - Hey, mr. Arsenault.
how's lily doing?
Oh, it's been pretty tough since the arrest.
but yale's considering taking her back.
that's great. Tell her I said hi. - Sure will.
say hello to dave pell.
I've heard a lot about you, dave. - Sam.
what's your poison? - Gimlet, gin.
coming up, you okay? - I'm fine, thanks, phil.
I hear I'm being vetted.
rumors travel halfway around the world before truth can tie its shoes.
so, are we traveling or lacing up?
depends. Are you interested?
bill richardson. Now, there's a man who did it right.
serves one term as energy secretary under clinton, then heads home and becomes governor.
I've always wanted to be governor.
that's an admirable goal.
ask around. I'm a pragmatist.
you're prepared to faithfully represent the interests of your country?
well, we're all businessmen here, are we?
Phil, what's going on out there?
is it safe for me to jump back into the market?
that depends how strong your stomach is.
come on, phil, give us a little something.
well, there are ample opportunities out there.
like mr. Buffet says, "when everybody else is fearful, it's time to be greedy.
look, the point is, these things are cyclical.
the market is a force of nature, and the economy is going to correct itself.
with a little oversight.
my wife and I are of the same mind on a great number of things.
this is the one area where we differ.
Phil makes the mistake of believing that man is inherently good.
no, I believe that man is inherently self-interested, and the only way to keep self-interest in check is through free market competition.
Sam, you'll back me up on that.
what? What was the question?
Sam, whose side are you on anyway?
whoever refills this first.
so, did wes call you?
Yes.
kind of out of the blue, actually.
he asked me for your number. I hope you don't mind.
no.
I don't even know if this is a weird question to ask.
would you mind if I went out with him?
Jesus. You need to ask my permission, as well?
he asked the same thing?
Yes. And no, I don't mind. God, why would I mind?
I don't know, i thought maybe you two might have something.
we're just friends. I'm not ready for that.
so, how much have you told him?
I mean, about david and frobisher.
we've talked about it. Um, you know, things come up in group.
cause I don't want to say something that i shouldn'T.
well, then, don'T.
right.
Ellen, seriously, if you don't want me to go...
no, katie, it's fine. I promise.
Oh, no, no, no, you're not going to go shy on us.
Oh, look, that was a one-time thing.
that's bullshit. You do it at the drop of a hat.
all right, so drop a hat. Just one.
Michael! Bring down the keyboard.
Ah, I'll go get him. - That's my man.
okay, dave, this one's for you. What's it going to be?
Danny boy.
are you serious?
it's a family favorite.
Oh, I used to do it at brown with the jabberwocks.
uh, try to imagine me in gray flannels and white bucks. You ready, michael?
and to think his company has a $4 billion market capitalization.
all these guys.
to the manner born.
what about you?
my dad smelted steel for 37 years.
Cheers.
Thanks.
you and sam arsenault still partnering in your, uh, charity foundation?
Yes.
what do you think of him?
I think he's a terrific guy, but you have to watch out.
why is that?
because, when you peel away all his glad-handing, honey-voiced charm, what's left is an entitled brat who considers himself above the rules.
he'll tell you exactly what you want to hear, and then turn around and stab you in the back.
good to know.
you boys seem all worked up. Where is the fire?
why is there no record of all the reports we've submitted?
excuse me?
we want to know why we don't have clearance to the case file for this investigation.
you mean this case file?
the investigation is strictly need-to-know. - Since when?
since the deputy director said it was.
Why?
the bureau has made this case a top priority, which means it can make or break a career
my career-- so stop whining and go out and get me something on patty hewes.
you like idaho?
I think it's our best bet.
is the plant manager willing to play ball?
definitely.
I spoke to my meteorologist.
he's predicting a foot of snow. Should be a big demand for home heating.
once we shut down supply, there should be a pretty healthy spike in price.
unless the storm shifts north.
Yeah, there's always that risk, but I still think that's the way to go.
you usually give me more options.
you usually give me more time.
fine. Idaho.
let me know when they plan to go off-line.
will do.
before finn and i were arrested that night, he made a stop.
he got out of our car and went into an suv.
was he meeting someone?
no. There was no one else there. Finn had his own set of keys.
what was he doing? I don't know.
he sat in the suv for a couple we drove off.
did you see what kind of suv it was?
a cadillac, I think. You know, the big one.
what was mr. Garrety's state of mind at the time? Did he seem anxious?
when he's coked up, it's a little hard to tell.
is there anything else you can remember?
that's all I saw.
okay, lonnie.
thank you for coming in.
Yeah, sure.
I had a nice chat with your family court judge.
I think you'll find he's sympathetic to joint custody.
thank you, ms. Hewes.
what's your verdict on sam arsenault?
he's got pipes. Hell of a singer.
and for the position?
I want to thank you for making the introduction, but, uh, truth be told, we're leaning in a different direction now.
more conservative?
more you.
you're a brilliant manager.
I don't know, dave.
Phil, you and I grew up in finance, and we both made a mint.
but I didn't get to where I am now until I went to washington.
and where is that? - Connected.
I don't see myself in government.
then do what I did.
stay for a year or two and jump back into the private sector.
I hate politics. You know that.
Yeah, but a decision like this isn't about politics.
it's about power. Influence.
you're rich, phil, but what's next?
will you kick it around?
I'll consider it, but I'm not making any promises.
understood, understood.
it's a pleasure to meet you, ms. Hewes. Have a seat.
no, thank you.
I'm here to tell you that I hold the fbi responsible for the death of pete mckee.
I'm sorry, but i don't know what you're referring to.
bullshit.
and you can tell who's ever calling the shots in washington that I'm on to them.
the bureau may be watching me, but I'm also watching you.
ma'am, I understand you're upset, but right about now, you're going to want to check your tone.
this investigation is corrupt, and when I prove it, your career will be over.
you don't want to threaten me.
I don't make threats, mr. Mcgraff.
this is war.
Patty hewes came to see me.
what do you want me to do?
forgive my place. Still putting it together.
sort of in-between gigs right now.
Oh, me, too. I totally get it. Thanks.
so, you were saying...
you were asking about grief counseling.
Yeah, I was wondering why you never went.
I'm not really into group therapy.
I see my own therapist. - Makes sense.
can I ask you something?
this sounds ominous.
you know, it's none of my business.
what?
it's not appropriate.
what?
I know ellen thinks that arthur frobisher had something to do with your brother's death.
do you think that? - I know he did.
why not go to the police?
because frobisher has got the police in his pocket.
so, you believe ellen's whole conspiracy theory.
Oh, it's not just a theory.
when patty hewes took on frobisher's case, she got all of his financial records.
from the shareholder thing. - Yeah.
Frobisher uses this private security firm which employs off-duty officers.
you think one of them did it?
you know what, I'd really rather not talk about this.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't even brought it up. - It's fine.
it's just that ellen thinks about it all the time, and I worry about her.
I understand.
so, chinese, italian? - Wes.
there's a very good, um, brazilian place like a block from here.
Wes, why did you call me? - What do you mean?
it's obvious that you're not actually into me.
what are you talking about?
you want to be with ellen.
is everything okay?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Katie said she called off your date.
Yeah.
you talk to katie connor? - Yeah.
Ellen parsons knows about the security firm.
she tell you that?
Patty hewes connected frobisher to calder protective services when he was her plaintiff.
they also think a cop murdered david connor.
they suspect anyone in particular?
not that I know of.
look, what are we doing?
Ellen parsons is getting closer.
Ellen doesn't even know you exist.
take her out. - What?
make it look like an accident.
do it, and you're done.
you aren't concerned about the feds looking into you?
the bureau's putting together a case.
we'll use you to monitor it from the inside.
Patty thinks the unr merger is about an energy trading scheme.
unr is using their power to manipulate energy prices for profit.
you told me I could use the firm to go after frobisher.
my resources are your resources.
for the past decade, frobisher has had a high-end security firm on retainer.
calder protective services.
if parsons traces this back to either of us, there will be consequences.
aracite is toxic.
the final report said that it was safe.
Kendrick had the report doctored.
I gave half of my life to this man and his company.
turns out he's a criminal.
do we have an energy secretary yet?
Patty hewes's husband?
we've only got one night in london.
how about this girlfriend of yours?
Michael's told me so much about you. I'm so glad we could finally meet.
are you alone? We need to meet.
who was on the goddamn phone?
I don't know his name.
you killed him, didn't you?
he made a call to the deputy director of the bureau.
is my supervisor in on this?
of course, he is. Now, get me patty hewes.
this happened last night?
who found him?
agents werner and harrison were sharing a domicile at the time.
I was staying with him.
since my wife and I split.
did you know that he had a problem?
no, and he never let it affect his work.
didn't he have to take drug tests?
Yeah, but there's ways of getting around that.
agent harrison loved his job, but...
we all have demons.
I guess that's how he dealt with his.
this... this happens in the middle of a case.
aren't you suspicious?
of course. And we've investigated it.
there's no evidence of homicide.
your cover is still intact, ellen.
we can still go after patty hewes.
Oh, it's okay.
I lied, too.
Oh, jesus christ.
my informant just shot patty hewes.
Yeah, that's right.
Ellen. How lovely to see you.
you have a meeting here, too?
no, the sullivan grand is my home these days.
Congratulations. Patty told us you're first choice for energy secretary.
fingers crossed.
great running into you. - Yeah.
tell patty I said hi. - Will do.
Patty's husband is having an affair.
interesting.
I don't know what to do. Should I tell her?
well, let's think about that.
if I told her, i could prove my loyalty, help secure her trust.
or she could shoot you for being the messenger.
especially if she already knows that he cheats and she lets him.
you're right. She won't want that thrown in her face.
if you don't know patty's response, smart move is to keep the information in your back pocket.
so, do nothing? - Yeah.
for now.
and to think my granddad never even learned how to write.
I'm sure he'd be very proud to have a library named after him.
God, I hated books as a kid. Reading out loud.
you've told me. With your stammer.
my father humiliated me every chance he got.
well, you've certainly come a long way.
I don't know why I'm getting all...
am I done here?
Yes. It looks official. Congratulations.
did you have an okay time with your father?
he is who he is.
before I go, I'd like to apologize.
what for?
questioning you the other day.
I only asked about your business plans so I could protect you.
I overreacted, claire. I'm sorry.
I don't doubt your leadership of unr.
I know that.
Patty's agreed to a personal profile in new york style magazine.
Patty and phil as manhattan's premier power couple.
Really? - Yeah, so be prepared.
the reporter may want to interview you.
Why? - Well, she's granted them full access.
this is the first personal interview patty's given in over a decade.
they will be fishing.
whatever you say about patty will live in print forever, so remember:
she's a saint; her marriage is perfect; she's the best damn boss you've ever had.
got it.
steering away from patty and phil for a moment, let's talk about you.
I understand your wife's pregnant.
she is, she is. A boy.
so, how is it possible to balance the pressures of a family with a high-stress job like this?
my wife and I had our first child the year i started to work for patty-- with patty
and I don't think she understood... I don'T...
I don't think i understood the sacrifice that it took and the commitment that was needed.
to a child. - To the job.
I mean, and yeah, and to the child. Yeah, of course.
but... but patty... the equanimity, the...
the grace with which she handles everything.
I mean, to be able to build a law firm like this and to raise her son at the same time...
it's, uh... it's extraordinary.
does patty have any flaws?
off the record?
okay.
not a one.
be sure it just doesn't get too flat on top. I like it to be just...
Hi, ellen.
thank you. - You're welcome.
so, I just needed your signature on these.
think I look too orange?
no, you look just the perfect shade of orange.
they're almost ready.
sorry this is taking so long.
do I have time for a cup of coffee?
Oh, of course.
Ellen parsons, carla stenson. She's writing the piece.
pleased to meet you.
we're doing the profile on ms. Hewes and mr. Grey.
on phil and patty.
I'd love to include you in the article, if it's all right with ms. Hewes.
Oh, that'd be fine. Ellen would be a great person to talk to.
she knows all my secrets.
I'm back. - Oh, good.
looks like they're ready. - Where do you want us?
Oh, just casual, on the couch.
all right, right in the middle here?
now, you ask phil all the tough questions.
okay.
it's hard to be casual.
is this good? Are we doing okay?
Hey, you.
why did you shut down my investigation of arthur frobisher?
I'm sorry. Did someone invite you into my office?
I've been calling your investigator.
he's refusing to look into calder security.
I told him not to.
Why?
we're under federal investigation.
I don't want anyone shining a light on the frobisher case.
we've connected frobisher to calder security. We have a lead now.
if we wait, he's just going to cover his tracks.
we're at war with unr, and the feds are targeting me.
these are my priorities, and if you have a problem with that, quit.
I ran a background check on you, mr. Wilcox.
you were in the marines.
military didn't work out.
conformity was a problem for me.
that's why I became a private investigator.
I work for myself now.
have you ever worked for patty hewes?
I choose my clients carefully.
is that a yes or a no? - That's a definite no.
people your age usually don't hire people like me.
is that a problem?
you work for one of the most powerful law firms in the country.
you must have resources, so... why do you need me?
it's a private matter.
my fianc? was murdered.
I know who did it. I just can't prove it.
well... I'd love to help you out.
this migraine is parked right behind my left eye.
it's stress.
mankind isn't supposed to live in cities.
throws our serotonin out of whack.
this is all walter kendrick.
forget about him.
he's been using me, using me to cover up his criminal activity for I don't know how many years.
if you want to be done with him, the only thing for you to do is resign.
I gave the company 20 years.
how do I just throw it all away?
maybe it's time for a change.
what if you and I try to find out what's really here between us?
Danny, I can't just sit around and let kendrick get away with all this.
you yourself said our company is still poisoning people in west virginia.
that's my problem. Listen to me.
you can't change unr.
maybe I can, if i oust kendrick and run the company myself.
what I want doesn't matter anyway.
why not?
the board just brought in mitch mccullen. He's next in line.
and he's ambitious.
you better bet that if there's an opening, mitch mccullen is going to grab it.
it says something when a man chooses to sit in his boss' seat.
what does it say?
maybe he's not too happy with his own job.
I love my job.
I think you'll find this useful.
thank you.
do you have more coordinates?
no, we're through with that. Get rid of the car.
chop it up. Dump it in the east river. Just make it disappear.
not a problem.
yeah? - It's malcolm.
what is it?
it's been days, no sign of finn garrety.
has anyone else approached the car? - No.
okay, it's been long enough. You know what to do.
did I mention... I ran into ellen parsons?
I had a meeting at the sullivan grand.
that's nice.
and how are you this fine morning?
I think I need coffee before I answer that.
Phil mentioned he ran into you.
Yeah, at my hotel. He said he had a meeting.
he seems very excited about his bid for energy secretary.
it always amazes me.
in a city this size, you still manage to run into people you know.
I want to apologize for pushing you to pursue frobisher's connection to calder security.
I, uh... I got emotional. I crossed a line.
we've talked about your temper, ellen.
it's a shame that you still can't control it.
I said I'm sorry.
I heard you the first time.
Hey, mitch. Thanks for meeting me.
it sounded urgent. What's wrong?
it feels like a betrayal to even talk to you.
a betrayal to who?
I've been a believer in walter kendrick for almost 20 years.
everyone knows that.
I know the board hasn't been happy since the merger.
what do you expect? We're facing a multimillion - dollar lawsuit that could have catastrophic long-term effects.
Walter assured me that it's only a matter of months before he turns that situation around, but...
I don't think it's going to happen.
why not?
because he's going to lose the shareholder suit against patty hewes.
he's already authorized a $50 million settlement.
she turned it down.
you know, I'd lay down my life for walter kendrick, but he's in over his head with this merger.
I don't want to see him drive the company off a cliff.
you think it's that bad?
you're next in line, mitch.
you could right the ship.
I'd need your support.
the executive committee trusts you.
if you can get the board to vote in a change of leadership...
I won't stand in your way.
I'll talk to my allies on the committee...
see if I can line up the votes.
Mitch, you can't let walter know you're making this move.
he won'T.
I'll be discreet.
I had drinks with mitch mccullen.
you finally decided to give him a chance?
he wasn't interested in romance, walt.
no? - No.
he wanted to talk about you.
you're right. That doesn't sound very romantic.
he told me the board is unhappy with your performance.
he said they've lost confidence in you.
the next earnings statement will bring them around.
I don't think they're going to wait that long.
Mitch is angling to oust you and take over as ceo.
he said that?
not in so many words, but I could read between the lines.
I think he's testing me. - What for?
to see if I'll back him if he makes a move.
What'd you say? - I said I would.
I figured it was best to let him think I was on his side.
good. That was the right play.
but walt, I don't think he would have been bold enough to approach me if he didn't already have enough votes to get rid of you.
well... thanks, claire.
you need to meet this head-on. Now.
I got a problem. There's a loose end I'm worried about.
yeah?
I may need to take matters into my own hands.
this loose end-- male or female? - Female.
what's your connection to her?
she's fallout from the frobisher case.
Jesus!
guy's not even a client anymore, he's still a pain in the ass.
if I take care of this thoroughly, things could escalate, but if I leave her alone, there are ways that she can trace her fianc? s death back to me.
well, that's a hell of a dilemma, rick.
but as far as calder security is concerned, you don't exist.
so, clean up your own goddamn mess.
calder security. I did some preliminary digging.
word is they have extensive black ops.
former military, ex-law enforcement.
the cop that went missing-- he was still on the force.
I'm not surprised.
connections in the police department would be very valuable to calder.
but I doubt that they would rely on just a beat cop.
what do you mean?
I'm sure there's someone higher up in the force who reports to them.
can you find out who that is?
Yeah, it'll be tough. There won't be a paper trail.
and if these are the men who murdered your fianc?
you can be sure there won't be any links to frobisher.
but the first step would be to prove these rogue operatives exist, and then find out who they are.
what would it take to do that? - Money.
you can use everything I have.
then I'll get started.
Oh, about that other thing-- you were right.
I'll be in touch.
morning.
yeah?
you're asking for me?
Oh, yeah.
the reporter would love to interview you about me and phil.
it would be my pleasure.
I was wondering, though. - Yeah?
how do you and phil make it work?
come in.
Oh, this new mail guy is driving me crazy. I said, come in!
you're never gonna replace uncle pete.
sorry, ms. Hewes. Is this a bad time?
give it to me.
so, you were asking about marriage.
well, you know, it's funny because everyone will tell you it's about trust, commitment.
it isn't? - No, that's exactly what it is.
trust, commitment.
I mean, some things in this life are simple.
Yeah, well, I guess that's comforting.
what is it?
it's nothing.
is everything okay?
Yes. Fine.
I have to get back to work now.
okay. Of course.
so, as a young woman working for patty, you must have an interesting perspective on her marriage.
Patty's very private about her personal life.
well, the people I've interviewed have spoken in such glowing terms about phil and patty, at a certain point, you have to wonder if it's too good to be true.
you know, carla, i see patty every day, and I can tell you, she and phil are absolutely devoted to each other.
and working for patty has taught me something about being a woman, you know?
a professional woman. Seeing how she balances work and her personal life.
what she prioritizes, how she prioritizes.
she's nothing less than an inspiration to me.
you want to take me down, asshole?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
don't give me that horseshit.
you think you're the only one with friends on the executive committee?
you may have friends, but I have the numbers.
you won't survive the next vote. - There won't be a vote.
it's my company.
don't think for one goddamn second you can take it from me.
I'm sure the sec would be interested to know exactly how you made your first million.
go ahead. But you take me down, you're going down, too.
I'm willing to lose everything. Are you?
there's a problem.
the car is gone.
anything useful? - No structural modifications.
nothing's been tampered with or concealed inside.
only 51 miles on the odometer.
this baby's good as new.
vehicle's completely clean?
there's one thing, though, that doesn't make sense.
for a car with such little mileage on it, someone sure has been using the navigation system a lot.
someone punched in a bunch of numbers into the gps.
locations? - No. It's bizarre.
they just used latitudes. No longitudes.
could they be transferring information to the energy trader using the gps?
could you get us a record of all the coordinates?
I think so. It might take a while to thoroughly hack the system's history.
do it, carl.
I'm sorry, claire. - What do you mean?
I can't do it. I can't make a move against kendrick.
why not?
he... he came to me. He, um...
he knows things.
I can't be in his crosshairs right now.
he's strong-arming you. - Well, it worked.
I don't have a choice.
as far as I'm concerned, we can't get rid of this bastard fast enough, but I'm out of the running.
I understand.
why don't you do it?
I'm not interested.
the board knows your loyalty and your commitment.
and kendrick will never see it coming.
that's true.
could you even mobilize the board on my behalf?
the votes are already lined up to make a move.
if you want this, claire, it's yours. Say the word.
her name is anna mercado.
born in brussels to an american diplomat.
she's a senior financial analyst with the london branch of phil's firm.
London. Of course.
well, she travels to new york at least once a month.
what's this?
I've started to track down phil's financials.
does he give her money? - No.
not that I've found.
these photos are just copies. Someone has the originals. If these get out...
you really don't have to explain the situation.
this usually means blackmail.
I expect you'll receive a call or a letter.
whoever sent these to you wanted to hurt you. Badly.
any idea who that could be?
your mom came to see me.
what she want?
don't get all dark.
you know, she's just a little preoccupied with abandonment issues.
my mom said that?
no, not in those words, but I mean, it's pretty clear.
she's worried about losing you to me; she's worried about losing you to college.
well, she doesn't have to worry about college.
why not?
I never applied.
I mean, the allure of an older woman is undeniable.
in junior high school, I was always more attracted to my older sister's friends.
it has nothing to do with jill's age.
her energy is incredibly attractive.
she lives in the moment.
I understand. We just don't want to see you get hurt.
thank you, but I can handle it.
well, anyway, you'll be going off to college soon.
the most important thing is that you're honest with her, that you treat her with respect.
Thanks, phil. I will.
I haven't felt like this in years.
the board actually wants you to be there when they fire him?
I asked to be there. They agreed.
if I'm going to do this, I owe it to him.
I want to look him in the eye.
well, you've won, claire.
and when you're in charge, get ready for people to come out of the woodwork with their own agendas.
I'm looking forward to it. - Starting with me.
I have a responsibility to deal with aracite.
I want you to oversee the clean-up... if you're open to it.
thank you.
new day. New chapter.
miss maddox, this way.
Claire. Good to see you.
where is everyone?
you know, I picked the wood for this table.
it's american cherry.
grows near the bituminous coal fields of pennsylvania. You know why I chose it?
I'm not here for a carpentry lesson, walt.
I picked it because it bends well.
but it's strong.
and it takes an excellent polish.
not like some of the other common american timbers.
like pine for instance.
pine is soft and weak.
but it's especially good for trim.
cut the shit.
you really think you have what it takes to sit at the head of my table?
you know I do. Where is the goddamn board?
if you had concerns about my stewardship, you should have come to me.
you lied to me.
I know about aracite. I know about the merger.
I know you've been fixing energy prices with forced brownouts.
so you can't stop me.
the board will find out who you really are.
and when they do, they'll prosecute you.
all thiplotting and betrayal isn't in your nature, claire.
must have kept you up nights.
except those nights when you were sleeping around.
it's over, claire.
an hour ago, the board voted to let you go.
on what grounds?
on the grounds you had sexual relations with daniel purcell.
you can't be serious.
it's a simple legal issue, really.
you engaged in an improper relationship with a unr contractor.
that's a violation of our code of conduct.
but then, as former lead counsel, you would know.
you wrote the damn thing.
don't you dare talk legal ethics with me.
have to say, it didn't help that mr. Purcell was a married man whose wife was murdered.
the board tends to shy away from that sort of scandal.
so did daniel purcell tell you I was screwing him?
no. Mr. Purcell really seems to like you.
go to hell.
I probably will.
but while I'm here, no one is going to take away my goddamn company!
go home. I sent you a present.
I want you to destroy the son of a bitch.
everything you're accusing him of is true.
of course, I can't help you. What I know is privileged.
it can't be used in court.
but I can offer you some insight.
what's that?
Walter is deeply connected. He plays dirty.
and it is going to take someone like you to stop him.
I've watched your career over the years, patty, and I don't like the way you do business, but I get it.
I get that it's necessary.
there's one more thing you need to know.
it's about daniel purcell. - Yes?
I was as surprised as you when he flipped on the stand.
but you can trust him now.
he wants to set things right.
thanks for the drink.
thanks for the advice.
you were right. I'm done relying on patty.
I've hired my own investigator.
should have done it a long time ago.
it's tom.
what's up? - Turn on the news.
Patty hewes may be heading to court again soon, and her opponent this time may be her husband, energy secretary nominee phil grey.
Mr. Grey's recent nomination catapulted him into the national spotlight, and he seemed a shoo-in for the cabinet...
but that was before he was caught in a compromising series of pictures with a london trader, anna mercado.
now, mr. Grey has been forced to withdraw his name... From consideration.
I thought you weren't going to tell anyone.
I didn'T.
Ellen, did you leak those photos to the press? - No.
Patty must have.
Patty? - I'm up here.
I've been, uh, cleaning out my closet.
just take whatever you want.
Thanks.
Oh, actually...
it's really not your style.
I'll just give it all to goodwill.
okay.
are you here alone?
Michael's with his geriatric girlfriend, and phil's at a hotel.
I'm sorry. Must have been an awful shock.
it wasn't the affair.
it was that he... got sloppy.
let himself get caught.
that bothers me.
I don'T...
I can't figure out whether I should thank you.
for what?
sending me the pictures.
you could have been trying to protect me.
let me know before the... world knew.
or maybe you were just being vindictive.
I think you're angry.
I'm sorry that I didn't let you pursue frobisher.
this isn't personal, ellen.
you've got to let things just roll off your back.
why did you leak the pictures to the press?
that's my business.
it's not that easy to let things roll off your back, is it?
why am I here?
I wanted you to know.
know what?
things may be required of us.
Meaning? - Meaning...
this case...
is going to get ugly.
that's all.
close the door on your way out.
maybe we're both the vindictive type.
my informant just shot patty hewes.
Ellen parsons... - What are you doing here?
you're under arrest.
I heard you were looking for me. - Josh.
can we talk somewhere safe?
I'd like you to sit in on the Louis Tobin interview.
I will find the money, Mr. Tobin.
tell me where it is and I'll leave your family alone.
there is no fortune.
I want the money. - Good.
they're going to sentence your father this week, sending him straight to prison for the rest of his life.
when the time comes, he's going to contact us - about the money, right? - Right.
what's Danielle Marchetti's prognosis?
she's out of the operating room and in recovery.
Joe wanted her on that plane to protect his father.
what makes you think Danielle Marchetti had anything to do with the fraud?
Louis Tobin called her the night he confessed to the Ponzi scheme.
I'm ready, Karl.
you want my advice? Let her take the lead because whatever the Tobins are hiding,
Patty will find it.
Tom, I'm running a little late, so don't have the staff meeting without me.
happy birthday.
it's not my birthday.
sure, it is.
what's it doing here?
I thought you wanted one.
did I?
it's all you ever wanted.
this is going to be your best birthday ever.
careful.
she's a big responsibility.
I know.
are you sure it's what you want?
Yes.
can I keep her?
can I keep her?
you're going to have to wash your feet first.
somebody should say something.
daddy never judged.
he treated everyone the same.
when Lenny first started working for him
when Daddy brought you home for the first time
I remember he said to me,"Lenny's family now.
just like that.
dad was too generous.
all he ever tried to do was to give people what they want.
that's true.
it was his flaw.
he wasn't greedy and he wasn't evil.
those investors knew what he was doing...
and it was exactly what they wanted him to do...
but... he paid the price for them.
they should be underground, not him.
it's the truth.
I miss you, Daddy.
I love you.
it's okay, sweetie.
all this stuff's going up for auction?
we're selling off everything in Tobin's apartment.
the proceeds go to the victiMs.
are you sure you guys don't want a muffin?
uh, no, I'm good.
uh, so talk to me about the M. E. report.
you really believe Louis Tobin's death was a heart attack?
do you?
me?
pretty convenient.
guy dies the night before he's going to jail for the rest of his life.
he robs his victims of their moment of justice.
all we got now are his wife and children.
if you want to connect them to the fraud, you're going to have to depose Danielle Marchetti.
the doctors say Ms. Marchetti will be released from the hospital tomorrow.
in the spirit of cooperation, why don't we talk to her together?
okay, but first, why don't you tell me everything you've got on her?
I already have.
well, Patty, you withheld your knowledge that Louis Tobin called Ms. Marchetti on Thanksgiving.
Yes, and I was wrong and I apologize.
so why don't we just start over?
why don't you lead the questioning?
and we'll depose her together.
okay, fine, let's depose her together.
did my father tell you he was going to kill himself?
I just want to know the truth, Lenny.
he did.
he would have told you, but you didn't come see him like he asked you to.
he couldn't face spending the rest of his life in prison.
did you know Dad was going to leave this behind?
what is it?
and how to get it back.
he left this for Patty Hewes?
with a very nice letter.
he says he's coming clean for me, to free me of his legacy.
I had no idea about any of this.
well, it's a fascinating read.
now I know why he was trying to get Danielle out of the country.
she knows where the money is?
no, but she knows enough.
he says you don't know where it is either.
he only told me that someone would contact me when it was safe to retrieve it. He didn't said who.
there's a name in there a few times
he helped Dad with the money somehow.
Stuart Zedeck. - Zedeck-- do you know him?
I don't know, your father mentioned him a couple times.
I just assumed he was an investor.
well, he's more than that.
I want to meet him.
okay, I'll see if I can set it up.
no, set it up.
listen, will you set up a meeting with Judge Reilly?
sure, what for?
I don't believe Patty for a second.
we have to talk to Danielle before she does. - Okay.
you don't really want Gates to take the lead in Danielle's deposition, do you?
no, he'll only fumble any shot we have of getting information from her.
we have to get to Danielle before he does.
right. Oh, hey, it's your birthday this weekend, right? What are you doing?
I haven't thought about it.
come on, you got to do something.
gates brought Ellen with him again.
why haven't you interviewed any possible associates?
I've been reading r? sum?
And?
and there's only one candidate who seems promising.
man or woman? - Woman.
Oh, Jesus, does every woman go to law school these days?
her name is Alex Benjamin.
okay, bring her in.
5 months later loss.
was it a homicide?
we haven't been able to confirm that.
Alex Benjamin? Welcome. Tom Shayes.
Mr. Shayes, it's a pleasure.
right. Oh, uh, this way.
it's best not to go into an interview with Patty cold.
most likely she'll grill you on precedents regarding our current case, but any topic is fair game
constitutional law, torts, contracts.
not a problem. - Good.
Patty's not looking to see how you handle the facts.
she's looking to see how you handle yourself.
got it.
no, you don't.
um, when it comes to reading people, she's got the sharpest bullshit meter you've ever seen.
I understand. I think I can handle it.
good.
all right, we'll set up a meeting with Patty.
anytime, anyplace. You name it.
anytime?
what if, uh, the meeting were to take place during your sister's wedding?
I'd miss the wedding.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
you're not allowed in to see Ms. Marchetti.
I'm the court - appointed trustee in the Tobin case.
my office subpoenaed Ms. Marchetti.
I'm sorry. I have my orders.
afternoon, Patty.
your access has been suspended.
I thought we were going to talk to her together.
then, what are you doing here without me?
the judge has granted me sole access. - On what grounds?
you withheld evidence, Patty.
next time, don't keep information from me.
excuse me.
I'm Curtis Gates, Investigative Division,
district Attorney's Office.
what do you want?
the night you were going to leave the country, you left a message with our office.
no, that was a mistake.
we know you're scared, Danielle.
we also know about your relationship with Louis Tobin.
but we're not interested in prosecuting you.
all we want is the family.
we're prepared to offer you immunity.
if I do what?
go on the record. Tell us everything you know.
deal's off the table in 48 hours.
think about it, Danielle.
you'll be out of the hospital soon.
we can help you.
someone videoed Dad's funeral and put it online.
what? - They show us standing at the grave site.
I mean, they were there, just hiding in the cemetery while we were burying him.
it's disgusting.
he's dead.
they won't stop attacking him.
Carol, calm down.
why are we here, Joe?
because you deserve to know the truth.
Carol, the autopsy was wrong.
he didn't die of a heart attack.
what do you mean?
the night he died, I went to the apartment.
I found that on the coffee table near his body.
what is this?
I called Dr. Brandt.
he made the mix for Dad.
so it would be painless.
no. Daddy would never do that.
honey. - I'm sorry
he did. He did.
he ended his own life.
listen.
listen. - Listen.
you...
we have to stop blaming everyone else.
he did this to himself. Okay?
Carol, he did it to himself.
is everything okay?
there's no reason to be anxious.
have you ever done this before?
many times.
well, then, tell me what you like.
I want you inside me.
my father died.
he wasn't my real father.
he was closer than my real father.
and he was a friend.
I'm so sorry.
can I put my head in your lap?
Yes.
morning.
there's a guy waiting for you in the conference room.
says he's a friend, knew you a while back.
friend of mine? - That's what he said.
did he say his name was Wes?
I'm not sure.
Hi. Can I help you?
Hey, Ellen.
Hey. Josh Reston.
goodness. Long time.
I, uh, think the last time we spoke, - you were down in West Virginia busting Big Coal. - Yeah.
what are you doing in New York?
well, I've only been here a couple weeks.
I, uh, just got a job reporting crime attheManhattan Observer.
Congratulations. Sit, sit.
Thanks. Uh, it's just a start.
but, um... I remembered you from the UNR case.
well, what can I do for you?
well, uh, when I heard that you were here at the D. A.'s office,
I thought that...
we could help each other out.
you want tips on stories.
Oh, I thought I'd ask.
uh, you know, I just read that, uh,
Joe Tobin got pulled over for a broken taillight.
you want to know about the Tobin case.
well, I know it's a lot to ask, uh, but what I'd really like is an anonymous source at the D. A.'s office.
you know, strictly confidential.
and if I could ever help you, it would be a two-way street.
interesting.
I'll think about it.
Yeah, well, no worries either way.
Yeah, and I appreciate your time.
it was nice seeing you.
Yeah, you, too.
thanks for stopping by.
go over everything carefully.
this will be your last opportunity before auction.
they're selling off everything.
happy Thanksgiving. I love you all.
Cheers.
you can take personal effects of sentimental value only.
anything appraised over $20 will go to auction.
$20?
that's right.
excuse me.
these are Dad's teacups.
I can't do this.
it's okay, sweetheart.
they're taking away everything that's left of him.
Carol. - Mom, just let her go.
I want all the pictures.
uh, we can get you the photos, but not the frames.
and I want these.
I'm sorry, ma'am. Those are priced for auction.
you said anything personal or sentimental.
these are my grandson's favorites.
these are very personal to me.
Mrs. Tobin got those in Tanzania.
her charitable foundation treated sick children.
she can't have them. - Jesus, just give them to her.
no, there's nothing I can do.
okay, you know what? Here.
here's the money for them, okay?
they go to the highest bidder.
I will contest this.
I just got a call. Mr. Zedeck will meet with us.
good.
I just, uh...
uh, wanted to tell you that I-I love you.
5
I can't believe it.
gates blocked you out?
can't you appeal to the judge?
judge Reilly owes his appointment to the D. A.
,he'll never side with me.
you getting anywhere with Louis Tobin's will?
Tobin left all his money in trusts for his family
Marilyn, Joe, Carol, and the grandson.
but, before the Ponzi scheme unraveled, he had a different will drawn up.
it has an additional trust in it.
for whom?
I don't think so.
see, it's a blind trust, administered by a guardian.
which often means that the trust has been setup for a minor.
let's talk to Marilyn Tobin again.
Christ, it's freezing!
you sure this is the place?
I'm Leonard Winstone. This is Joe Tobin.
my condolences. Your father was a brilliant man.
thank you.
so, uh, we appreciate you meeting with us.
and we'd like to start making transactions.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
what? Why not?
because Mr. Zedeck is no longer comfortable with the arrangement.
wait a second, you're not Stuart Zedeck?
I'm his associate.
okay, let's go. - Come on.
well, what the hell does that mean? He's
Zedeck's not comfortable with the arrangement?
well, he's concerned that the climate is no longer safe for him to conduct business.
it's our money, asshole. It belongs to my family.
your father agreed to terms with Mr. Zedeck.
somebody in your family breached those terMs.
who? That's bullshit.
is it?
then how come the authorities know about Danielle Marchetti?
that's-- it doesn't matter. She-she won't be a problem.
ms. Marchetti is already a problem.
and as long as she remains one,
Mr. Zedeck is unable to administer any transaction on your behalf.
look... - That's it. That's it.
what do you want to do?
I'll take care of Danielle.
Princeton, Yale Law.
sterling recommendations.
is that all?
is what all?
you're efficient and you're competent.
and you're bored.
what is the one thing that you would never want me to know about you?
when I was a 2L, I got rejected by Law Review.
then I found out that my faculty adviser who taught the Law Advocacy Workshop had blackballed me.
and why was that?
he said I was, and I quote, a "loudmouth.
so I filed a sexual harassment suit and got him fired.
did he actually harass you?
no. But a bunch of other girls said he was a perv.
so, it's close enough, right?
none of that happened.
not a word of it.
I like you, Alex.
I'll check out your references and get back to you.
thank you, Ms. Hewes.
Oh, and happy birthday, by the way.
it's not my birthday.
no? Isn't it this weekend?
no.
sorry. I guess Wikipedia got that wrong.
we'll be in touch.
gates subpoenaed me.
I'm going to be deposed.
it's all in there-- everything you have to say.
you want me to lie under oath?
I, I can go to jail for that.
if they had enough to arrest us, they would have done it already.
we just have to stick to the same story, right?
I want an attorney to go in with me.
no, go alone.
it'll seem like you have nothing to hide then. Okay?
everything you have in life, you have because of my father.
I know that.
well...
he's gone now, and I can take it all away from you.
do you understand me?
Yes.
so here's the story you tell the D. A.
I suggest you stick with it...
because if we go down, I am taking you with us.
so Patty suggested we meet?
she thought you'd have some valuable perspective.
on what? - The job, I guess.
I thought the interview went great, and then she called.
and did she hire you?
no, not yet. She said I should speak to you first.
Really?
excellent bag, by the way.
it's stunning.
thank you.
can I ask... did Patty fire you?
is that what she told you?
no, I just-- I thought...
why would anyone in their right mind leave Hewes & Associates?
well, yeah, especially for a job in the public sector.
Patty didn't fire me.
you quit?
it's a funny thing. You know, a friend of mine once warned me about ambition.
he told me that maybe the world needs people like Patty Hewes.
but that doesn't mean that you should go work for her.
why not?
because once you sign on, she'll own you.
I think I'd like that.
Yeah, well, I didn't.
I wanted a life.
and how's that going?
it's going great.
it's going really great.
thank you for agreeing to see me.
I thought if we met, it should be here.
I had to fight paparazzi just to get through the gate.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for your loss. Truly I am.
I heard that you wanted these.
thank you.
you're welcome.
I think my husband killed himself.
did you know that?
no.
I just wanted to bring you those. My condolences.
I-I'm worried about my daughter.
uh, she's not handling this well.
she's, um...
it's got to stop.
I beg you to leave us alone.
I understand because I'm a mother, too, but I have an obligation to your husband's victiMs.
what can I do?
W-what will make you leave us alone?
tell me the truth about Danielle Marchetti.
why did Louis really call her on Thanksgiving?
you don't understand.
make me understand.
you think my husband used Danielle to hide money.
his mistakes were much more foolish than that.
I left my pills.
please bring them over.
I don't care. Leave them in the lobby.
just do it, Danielle. Goddamn it, just do it.
so...
you've been in Louis' life all these years.
just give him the pills.
then you had the baby, didn't you?
I loved him.
Louis was supporting Danielle because he had a child with her.
Yes.
do you know where that child is now?
I never asked. I...
I have my own family to worry about.
Mrs. Tobin, just-just one more thing.
when we were tracking down the phone number you gave Joe,
Louis tried to get Danielle out of the country.
because he knew his family.
he knew Danielle Marchetti could have torn us apart.
it had nothing to do with money.
I wasn't expecting that.
Yeah. Me, neither.
this is a...
this is a nice place.
you live alone?
Yeah.
I had a house down in West Virginia.
but up here, I live in a shoe box.
how do you afford a place like this on a government salary?
well, I saved some money from when I worked for Patty.
right. Why'd you quit there anyway?
I mean, you guys were handling Frobisher and UNR. It's...
you were at the center of the legal universe.
Yeah. It's a long story.
is, uh... ... everything okay?
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good. Uh, just, a... little restless.
well, if you want to get some dinner, I don't have anywhere to be.
Yeah. I feel like cooking.
baking, actually.
are you sure?
Yeah. It's my new therapy.
you like cupcakes?
Hello?
ms. Marchetti, this is Patty Hewes.
do you know who I am?
Yes. - Good. Then listen carefully.
I know you have an arrangement with the Tobin family.
that's not true.
don't lie to me. You'll only dig yourself in deeper.
what do you want?
whatever story they want you to feed to the D. A. 's office
for your own good-- don't do it.
gates has offered me immunity.
you think immunity will protect your daughter?
wait a minute. Who told you about my daughter?
I will find the Tobin's fortune, Ms. Marchetti, and when I do, they'll go to jail.
you and your daughter will be left alone, and I'll control who gets the money.
help me now, and I can provide for you.
that's an offer Gates can't make.
I can't tell the truth in that deposition tomorrow.
I don't want you to.
what do you mean?
it's your constitutional right to say nothing.
I just want you to sit there and plead the Fifth.
do it...
and I'll take care of you.
ms. Marchetti, just for the record, you're aware that you're entitled to have an attorney present, if you desire one?
Yes, I'm aware.
okay, then, let's begin.
uh, Ms. Marchetti, do you recall when you first met Louis Tobin?
ms. Marchetti?
do you understand the question?
Yes, I understand.
when did you first meet Louis Tobin?
I invoke my right not to answer, on the grounds I may incriminate myself.
ms. Marchetti, are you aware what you're doing?
I'm pleading the 5th.
this came for you, Ms. Hewes.
thank you, Perry.
getting chilly out there.
it sure is. - Gonna be a long winter.
I have to say, Carol,
I certainly didn't expect to see you knocking at my door.
I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.
I know what you're going through is extremely difficult.
it is.
but I'm not exactly sure what you want from from me.
I know it's weird, but you have a history with my family, and I'm the only one that didn't really get to know you.
well, you were young.
back when you and Joe were together, he never really brought you around.
your mother hated me.
I think she may have blamed you for some of his shit.
it seemed like things started going crazy for him once he met you.
it wasn't like that.
no? What was it like?
look, Carol, um...
I wasn't a saint.
but neither was Joe.
my dad took care of you?
did you take care of him?
it's complicated.
we were just trying to make the best of a difficult situation.
did you love him?
look, Carol, I am really sorry for your family.
I am.
but I'm gonna get your coat.
are you going to hire Alex Benjamin?
who?
the candidate you interviewed.
I don't know.
and what's next for Danielle?
go over there tonight.
just make sure that she's still willing to talk to us.
no problem.
I want to talk to her about her daughter.
I know your mother, Danielle.
I thought it was time we met.
miss Marchetti?
miss Marchetti, your door was...
happy birthday.
she's a big responsibility.
it's all you ever wanted.
the warmth all lie behind these walls.
you okay there, Patricia?
what's this? - My resignation from the firm.
I tracked the VIN on the car that hit Ms. Hewes.
who's the owner? - Thomas Shayes.
and you two are...? - Having a baby.
Jill and I got the chromosomal tests back. Kid's all mine.
how much would it take for you to walk away?
make it $500, 000. - It's yours.
are you nuts? We can't afford these.
Oh, yes, we can.
Frobisher may have hired a police officer to commit a murder.
what did Detective Messer tell you?
I pulled everything the department had on Messer.
it's a list of his partners. I know this guy.
Wes, it's Ellen. I need to talk to you.
did you know Dad was going to leave this behind?
it explains where the money is.
your father never wanted anything to happen to Tessa Marchetti.
the girl was going to turn us in.
if you had told Joe that Tessa was his daughter, she'd still be alive.
this is my job, Dad.
there's money, and I want in.
we'll need to see some identification, Mr. Zedeck.
the usual denominations?
so, the man who's acting as the Tobins' lawyer is not Leonard Winstone.
who are you?
I'm the man who has taken care of your family for almost three decades.
you're not even a lawyer!
you're finished.
I'll give you names, account numbers, enough details to put them in prison for the rest of their lives.
in exchange for what? - Immunity from prosecution.
I know it's a crucial time for you.
finishing law school, job interviews.
I assume you've got a bar exam coming up.
Yes, I do.
but I think we can agree that being a mother is more important than any of that, huh?
excuse me.
you, uh, study over at the university?
Yes. The law school.
what are you doing walking all the way out here?
just wanted some air.
well, you picked a beautiful spot for it.
my name is Decker.
Patricia. Nice to meet you.
a baby's a big responsibility. Sure you're ready?
I've always wanted a child.
what the hell happened to this place?
I was kicked out of my house.
I've been living here. I hope that's all right.
what's all that?
Ah, as you know, my family finances are a mess.
I've been trying to sort it all out.
good luck with that.
Mr. Winstone?
I want you to know the DA's office has agreed to your terms for immunity.
I'd like to take these and look them over.
due diligence. I'm sure you understand.
these papers won't be filed with the court unless you fulfill our arrangement.
I assure you... you'll get all you need to put the Tobins away.
Hello, Patty.
I'm surprised you're still in the city.
I called you because I wanted to thank you for your generosity.
I got this for Michael. He always wanted a Jaguar.
you don't want to do this, Jill.
we moved into a three-bedroom.
you will adore what we're doing with the nursery.
when you accepted my money, you knew what my terms were.
Yeah, and I thought about them - I really did - but I'm not going anywhere.
michael and I are having this baby.
don't think you can dictate the terms of our relationship.
I can play power games, too, Patty.
does Michael know about the money?
no. I didn't tell him that you tried to buy me off.
would you like me to?
my baby shower is next week.
but, please, no gifts.
Mr. DiFolco. It's nice to see you again.
how are you?
did you tell Mr. Zedeck that I wanted to meet him?
sorry.
like I said, he's a busy man.
well, I appreciate him taking time out of his schedule to come by.
when was that?
the other day. He made a withdrawal himself.
he's a very nice man.
this guy said he was me?
he knew exactly which account, exactly what to say.
but the bank has everything about me on file.
my age, my social security number.
they didn't check this guy out?
I was told he was the right age and he had credentials.
what kind of credentials?
he forged a passport using all Mr. Zedeck's information.
Lenny knew about the account.
you should have never cut Lenny off.
you turned him against us, Joe.
what the hell is he going to do next?
we need to find him.
see what you can do, Ben.
long time, Parsons.
thanks for calling me back.
how have you been?
you know... busy.
lot of traveling.
I'm sorry I disappeared on you the way I did.
you never told me you were a cop.
Yeah, well, I guess, um, there's a lot of things that I couldn't tell you back then.
for example, Detective Rick Messer?
how do you know about him?
he came to me about my fiance's murder.
he thought he had a suspect. Ellen...
Messer killed your fiance.
and Frobisher was behind it, just like you thought.
how do you fit into all of this?
Messer was my partner years back.
he had some dirt on me.
when I was a rookie, I pulled some shit I could have gone to jail for.
Messer knew about it. He had leverage on me.
he asked me to track you, make sure you weren't getting close to Frobisher.
so, you were lying to me from the beginning?
sorry.
and so, what happened between us was...
that was real.
so I switched sides.
you killed Messer, didn't you?
I can link Frobisher to Messer.
I can put Frobisher away for David's murder.
but you would have to give yourself up to do it.
don't.
I've let go.
I had to.
and you going to jail - that's not going to bring back David.
key.
here's the title. Thank you.
once you register this bad boy to your name and address, you're good to go.
great. Appreciate it.
um, can this come off?
Yeah, but I'd leave it.
why is that? It's good luck.
89, 000 miles without a scratch.
we're all set.
Winstone will deliver the evidence and the money to me at the loft.
then I'll pick it up and bring it to you. I'll be here.
don't use your own car. I don't want you being followed.
it's parked out front. - Okay.
what is it?
the two of you have been talking to Winstone.
are you sure we can trust him?
there's always a risk.
it's a risk I got to take.
all right. Let's do it.
Ah, thank you, Farook, beautiful.
Oh, hey, you want a shawarma? It's the best meal in town.
we couldn't meet anywhere more private, huh?
Yeah, I prefer talking to you in public.
Mmm! Thank you.
I was sorry to hear what happened to our bearded friend.
it's a real tragedy when a police officer dies.
Yeah, although I didn't even know he was a cop until I read about the shooting in the paper.
you know, what are we doing here?
why did you call me?
david Connor, Ellen Parsons' fiance.
goddamn it, man.
this just won't go away, will it?
you can make it go away.
how? Turn yourself in.
Messer and I went back a long way.
I know he killed David Connor on your orders.
let me ask you something.
who killed Rick Messer?
he was shot in the line of duty.
is that what you think? 'Cause I don't.
see, before he died, Messer told me that you turned on him.
he didn't trust you anymore.
that you were actually protecting Ellen Parsons.
now, if I were you, I'd be very, very careful.
in the eyes of the law, there's nothing worse than a cop killer.
the little piece of shit is stealing money from us.
no, no, Lenny would never do that.
mom, wake up.
he turned on me, now he's trying to wipe us out.
Lenny worshipped your father.
dad was an idiot.
everything your father did, he did for you.
?
sweetheart, are you okay?
I'm sorry, Rachel.
could you give me just a few minutes with my family?
dad, what's going on?
there's something I need to tell you.
how could this happen?
it was all a fraud?
why did you do it?
what do you mean?
Joe is not a businessman, never was.
he made a mistake years ago when he was drinking.
what kind of mistake?
you know how he was back then.
he had to be the big shot.
he promised investors returns he could never deliver.
and you didn't want him to fail.
Lenny and I had to get creative.
we paid out the returns Joe promised with other funds.
we thought if we had a few months, we could set things right, but...
you never told Joe?
no, and I don't want him to know.
why the hell didn't you tell me this before?
you've been lying to me since Thanksgiving.
what are you doing?
Joe, please, don't.
Oh, Joe, please don't.
I see what you did.
you knew if you told me the truth, that I would turn the money in.
but you didn't want to live like that, right?
what else haven't you told me?
nothing.
there's nothing.
it's on your head now. Yours.
everything that's happened, you live with it. Alone.
please, Joe.
I told you from the very beginning what would happen if you kept lying to me.
no, please.
you're not gonna see your grandson again.
Oh, please, Joe.
you're not gonna see Rachel again.
no, please.
you're not gonna see me again.
you are dead to me.
no, please!
get out.
get out!
please don't do this to me.
get out.
uh, just hang on a sec.
I'll let you out.
Thanks, babe.
it's like getting out of a beanbag these days.
Jill Burnham?
get out the car, ma'am.
What...?
Hey, what the hell's going on?
we're taking Ms. Burnham into custody.
I knew this had to be you.
how intuitive.
they won't tell me why I'm being held.
I asked them to let me do the honors.
I have connections.
and you think you're doing this to me, but it's your son you're hurting.
you hurt my son. You had sex with him.
it was always consensual.
sexual intercourse with a minor is never consensual.
and you're going to prison.
michael would never testify against me.
I don't need him to.
he sent me chromosomal tests to convince me that he was the father.
the date of conception is the only proof I need to put you away.
all right, all right, I'll give you back your money.
all of it.
I don't care about the money.
I've already seized the car and the apartment.
well, then I'll just go.
I'll leave the city like you wanted.
it's too late.
and when the baby's born in prison, Michael will have sole custody.
and you think that's what Michael wants?
how could he possibly know what he wants?
you're despicable...
and you're a criminal.
and you forced my son to make a choice he should never have had to make.
michael can't take care of a baby alone.
he's-he's not ready for that.
no, he's not.
but I'll make sure he has plenty of help.
you'll be out of this baby's life, and Michael will be out of yours.
please.
what can I do for you, Mrs. Tobin?
if I confess, will you leave Joe alone?
confess to what? - The Ponzi scheme.
I'm guilty. I knew all about it from the beginning.
I'm not sure I believe that.
what if I tell you more?
there are other crimes, Ms. Hewes.
Tessa Marchetti... I had her killed.
it's true.
I did it so that Joe would never find out...
find out what?
that Tessa... was his daughter.
years ago, Danielle came to me when Joe got her pregnant.
she hadn't told him.
and I didn't want Joe saddled with a child.
it would have ruined him.
so I had Louis pay her to make the baby go away.
I see.
but on Thanksgiving, I learned that...
that Louis hadn't gone through with it.
he let Danielle have the baby.
Danielle was never Louis' mistress, for God's sake.
he...
he supported her because Tessa was his granddaughter.
please, Ms. Hewes, leave my son son alone.
take me instead. I'm responsible.
I'm the one you want.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tobin, but you're not.
I want Joe.
so, Terry told me about what happened.
the little escapade in your Escalade?
I thought it was fascinating. Really?
Oh, yeah.
I've always thought a man has to be awful if he wants to be great.
so tell me, what's the worst thing you've ever done?
why don't you and I go for a ride in my Escalade?
you can ask all your questions, and I'll give you all sorts of answers.
I'll get my coat.
Oh, man.
boy, you never learn.
always so eager to have people like you.
I haven't told her anything.
Oh, you've said plenty.
Yeah, you need to relax, man.
you're the one lying in the ground with a hole in your head.
you know, my life turned out just fine.
for now.
nice talking to you, Ray.
I've got a date with a very sexy lady who's intrigued with my depravity.
so why don't you just buy yourself a fruity drink, flirt with the waiter and have some fun?
for Christ's sake, it's New York City, man.
come on.
take care.
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.
did you sign the immunity papers?
got it right here. What's wrong?
I don't trust Tom Shayes and I don't trust Patty Hewes.
she's made it clear she wants to take me down with the Tobins.
why do you trust me?
you worked for Patty and left.
I imagine you had good reason.
I did. Don't worry.
this case is going to make my career.
I have no reason to share it with Patty.
well, I admire that.
I'm a big believer in ambition.
you'll give Tom his money and the evidence...
I'll take it straight to the district attorney.
all right.
before we go through with this, Mr. Winstone, what is the evidence?
the night he died, Louis Tobin left an envelope with all the details of the fraud.
why did he do that?
he was going to confess.
and then Joe found the envelope and kept it.
so you don't have the evidence.
I know where it is. I'll let you know when I get it.
the immunity agreement.
thank you, Ms. Parsons.
Tom, how long have you been with me now?
almost 11 years.
it's time to put your name on the door.
thank you, thank you.
you don't have to worry about me.
I forgave you.
all your secrets are safe.
people either leave you or they die.
those are the only two endings possible with you.
what time did she say she was gonna meet us here?
she's 20 minutes late.
Jesus.
maintenance.
Mr. Tobin?
Hello?
what's wrong?
why are we meeting here?
I want you to call off the deal with Winstone.
what?
why now?
what's changed?
the case is over if we don't go through with this.
then the case is over.
I don't understand what you're doing.
Tom, whatever you and your family need, I can provide.
I can help you. - I don't want your help.
I'm telling you, call it off.
you two should go for a walk; it's a beautiful night.
I understand, Officer. I'll file a report. Thank you.
what was that? My bag's missing.
I think it's been stolen. I have to fill out some paperwork.
what's up? - I spoke to Patty. The deal's back on.
she changed her mind?
I convinced her to let me go through with it.
what are you talking about, Tom?
look, are you on board or not?
I need you.
okay.
good. Thanks. You know what to do.
Yeah, hey, the meeting went great.
Yeah, I'll be home in about 20 minutes.
all right.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Give me the keys.
know what, I gave you a chance to come clean.
wait.
one million, cash. Just give me a couple hours.
I don't want money. Spoke to Ellen Parsons.
Oh, shit.
she's not looking for justice.
well, then why are we doing this?
but... I'd like her to have some anyway.
no, wait, wait, wait, don't!
wait, please. Come on.
let me-let me just explain something, all right? All right?
go ahead. Tell me why you deserve to live.
come on. Damn it, listen to me!
I am a better person now! I- I... I am-I am... I'm volunteering, like, three times a week at this... at this you-youth thing.
and I'm-I'm, like, a coach of Little League, man.
I'm working my ass off on this whole environmental thing.
and-and I'm changing lives.
no, no! No! No, please, don't, please.
Oh, God!
please, don't.
please, don't!
Oh, God. I don't want to die.
I'd like to help solve a murder.
what?
you know what... make it two.
what are you...?
david Connor. Detective Rick Messer.
let's do this fast.
it's all here?
all of it.
good.
I'm a man of my word.
I see the cowboy turned you in.
what are they gonna do to me, Ray?
you had someone murdered.
what do you think they're gonna do?
I- I've been through trials before.
I'll land on my feet, right?
we'll get out of this.
we'll find a way.
we always do.
I've always admired that about you, Art.
what?
your eternal optimism.
well, goddamn right I'm optimistic.
this is America, for Christ's sake.
everything's possible.
not this time.
who the hell are you?
I'm looking for Leonard Winstone.
where is he?
I have no idea. He owns these lofts.
don't tell me you don't know where he is.
that bag looks familiar.
I think I remember seeing Winstone use it to carry his cash in.
you two strike up some kind of bargain?
this money's mine.
I don't give a shit about the money.
there's plenty more where that came from.
I want Winstone.
look, let me just take care of her, I'll tell you exactly where Winstone is.
she's a friend. She's just here for the money.
you here?
is that the money?
does Patty know about this?
don't worry about Patty.
do you still want me to take this to her?
Yes, just go.
now where's Winstone? I have no idea.
No!
Mr. Zedeck, Winstone's not here.
but you should tell Joe Tobin that I think he's made some kind of deal with Tom Shayes.
that's what I'm trying to figure out.
I know you got the money.
what did Winstone get in return?
nothing.
did Winstone give you evidence against the Tobins?
no.
you better start talking, 'cause the next one's going to go in your throat.
what did Winstone get from the deal?
you son of a bitch.
Oh, shit.
Where's the envelope?
Winstone didn't give Tom the evidence.
where is she? Where the hell is my mother?
I don't know. She's not answering her phone.
she had Jill arrested.
that's the mother of my goddamn baby.
I'm sorry.
if you find her, tell her I need to talk to her.
I will. I have to go.
Jesus, Tommy.
you're messed up.
where did you get this?
it's Ellen's.
where... where is she? Is she okay?
she drove off.
she's fine.
good.
make sure this gets back to her.
listen, Barry, uh, upstairs, there...
there's something I need you to do for me.
Hello?
Patty, where are you?
I'm on my way home.
we can talk when I get there.
I need to talk to you now.
michael wants to meet me at the apartment.
Patty, I...
shit.
you've reached the Shayes' family. Please leave a message.
I just, uh... uh... wanted to tell you that I... I love you, Deb.
but I made a mistake.
when you get this, take the kids and don't come home.
Tommy, what did you do?
I'll clean this up for you, Tommy.
holy shit.
Hey, man.
are you still with us?
in an era where everyone else is afraid to do so.
thank God for Patty...
Lenny, where are you?
it's over, Joe.
the DA has everything they need.
they'll be coming for you.
where the hell are you?
Zedeck told me you made a deal with Tom Shayes.
you should say good-bye to Rachel and Kevin.
I never wanted it to be this way, Joe.
I'm sorry.
you listen to me, you...
I understand it was quite a nasty car accident.
do you think this could have been done to you on purpose?
I have no idea.
is anybody here?
you made a little deal with Lenny... Lenny Winstone, didn't you, Tom?
get out.
a very nice house you have here, hmm?
Yeah, it's for sale. You want it?
I had a nice house, but you took it, didn't you?
I'm just trying to get back what's mine.
nothing was ever yours.
your father stole it and gave it to you.
you don't know a goddamn thing about my father.
except for he was a greedy scumbag.
watch your mouth. Get out of my house!
you don't know a thing about him.
you didn't know my father.
he loved me.
you didn't know my father. He loved me.
you don't know my family.
don't know a goddamn thing about me!
Oh, God.
Oh, God, I was good-looking.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Tom was like family... to me, Detective.
where to?
uh... uh, take me to the East River.
sure thing.
Thanks.
I want you to tell me how this bag ended up bloody and in... in a homeless man's shopping cart.
so, please leave a message.
I don't understand!
I told you not to go through with it!
I told you to stop!
I told you...
maybe, you know, we could figure this out, you know, together.
I don't think I'm in the right state of mind to help you right now.
you have one new message.
I told you not to go through with it!
I told you to stop!
Hello?
if you haven't found the documents by now, they're in your bag.
I wanted you to have them.
I told you I didn't trust Tom Shayes.
Mr. Winstone?
Mr. Winstone, where are you?
this is the final boarding call for Flight 328.
all passengers must go to the gate at this time.
your boarding pass, sir?
detective?
my bag- what else did you find inside it?
you said a homeless man had this.
why do you ask?
you're Tommy's friend, right?
Yeah, Ellen Parsons.
I got something for you.
sorry about the bag.
Tommy wanted me to get this back to you.
the police picked you up because that's all the evidence we need to seize the money.
did you know Tessa Marchetti was your daughter?
that's not true.
I can understand why you don't want to believe me.
your mother would have verified it...
but this morning, they pulled her body out of the East River.
the fish got to her, but you can still recognize her face.
when we first met, I believed you actually wanted to do the right thing.
I know what that's like.
you want to do good, you get backed in a corner.
it can lead a person to make unforgivable mistakes.
there's only one way you'll be able to live with yourself.
I want to talk to you alone.
?
now, listen to me, Joe.
what happened?
Mr. Tobin is gonna give you a statement.
he admitted to the murder of Tom Shayes.
what did you say to him?
we talked about confession.
I know it's a crucial time for you.
finishing law school, job interviews.
I assume you've got a bar exam coming up.
Yes, I do.
but I think we can agree that being a mother is more important than any of that, huh?
it was a nice service.
I'm gonna miss Tom.
this is my favorite place.
when I die, I don't want to be buried.
put in the ground.
I want to be cremated.
what about you?
I guess I haven't really thought about it.
of course.
you're young.
I want my ashes scattered here.
what are you going to do next?
I don't know.
I could go and work at a different law firm.
or I could come back and work for you.
or quit the law.
you're gonna have to decide what you want.
I was at a crossroads once.
I told you about the daughter I had.
Julia. You said she was stillborn.
her father is probably the only man I've ever loved.
but he didn't have my ambition.
he wanted to stay in the town where I'd gone to law school, make a life there.
but I was offered a job at a law firm in New York.
the first woman ever accepted there.
then I got pregnant.
so...
I had to make a choice.
marry him and raise our child there or go to the city and be a single mother.
?
excuse me.
you, uh, study over at the university?
Yes.
the law school.
my name's Decker.
nice to meet you.
call me Julian.
sure you're ready?
baby's a big responsibility.
I know it is.
what are you doing walking all the way out here?
especially in your condition.
my doctor said it would be all right.
then Julia died.
how?
I don't know.
the doctor said I was perfectly healthy.
you're having complications, which is why it's critical, absolutely critical, that you remain on bed rest for the remainder of your pregnancy.
no physical exertion of any kind... whatsoever, or you could lose the baby.
so if you love this child, Patricia, you will not get out of bed till the day it is delivered.
understood?
what are you doing walking all the way out here?
especially in your condition.
understood?
Yes, Doctor.
I understand.
you're gonna be a great mother.
I don't know why it happened, but I was free to start my career.
you know, someday...
I want a family...
children.
I should head back to the city.
I did want to ask you one question.
what's that?
it's career advice, really.
you've accomplished everything you set out to do.
is it worth it?
I'll see you, Patty.
meet my granddaughter.
michael had a chance to be a father, and he ran away from it.
it's been three years. Track Michael down.
I'm looking to hire a private investigator.
and who's this? - My son.
I am the founder and CEO of the High Star Security Corporation.
what is it with you and High Star?
they're a private army killing for a profit, making money off of death.
stay away from High Star.
dozens of lawyers have tried to build a case against them, and it's never worked.
I have a friend. He may know some things.
did something happen to you over there while you were working for Erickson?
I led a unit...
for a mission we should've never been on.
you don't go near Sanchez, understood?
if anyone finds out about that last mission...
that's why I sent him to a psychiatrist.
shrink's job to get the truth out the boy and the truth just isn't our friend.
something happened on that last mission, and High Star is covering it up.
the men who died, you knew them. These were your men.
high Star's over there, they're breaking the law for profit, and...they're accountable to no one.
what would you need me to do?
is that important?
I assume that's important.
I'm, uh, trying a case against the world's largest pharmaceutical company.
I mean...
it could mean hundreds of millions of dollars for my client, so...
you tell me.
sounds important.
look, you're in here, so...
you might as well talk to me. - Okay.
let's talk.
tell me about you.
was being a therapist always your dream, or was medical school just too tough?
we've had this discussion. The therapy is not about me.
we need to discuss how you ended up here, and then I have to sign off on your progress.
powerful feeling, isn't it?
do you like that?
on your personal form, you wrote that you have a son.
maybe we should talk about him.
he's my only child.
he ran away three years ago and left me with his baby daughter to take care of.
I recently hired somebody to track him down.
seems to be a lot in there to discuss.
there isn't.
have you had contact with, um...
no, I haven't.
I'm not holding my breath.
are you still taking care of your granddaughter?
Yes.
but I can't find a nanny.
that's my problem.
I'm afraid our session's over.
how many more of these do we have?
well, this is our second meeting, and, um, eight more sessions are required.
but next time we have to, uh, talk about why you got here in the first place.
I can't wait. Pleasure.
Lowry, come on, motherfucker, breathe!
all killed while working for High Star.
high Star conducted an illegal mission at the order of company CEO Howard Erickson.
during the execution of this mission, these men lost their lives.
and you're proposing that we file a wrongful death suit against High Star?
Yes, sir.
this is Jessica Lowry, Thomas Lowry's widow.
she represents the men's families, all of whom are willing to be plaintiffs in the suit.
who's this fourth man?
he was in charge of the unit.
Mr. Sanchez has since resigned from High Star, and he's willing to give eyewitness testimony against the company.
what does he say happened on the mission?
understandably, Mr. Sanchez is concerned about the potential consequences of testifying, so before he gives any details he wants to be certain that the firm will support the case.
how many other cases have been brought against High Star?
almost 60, and they've all been dismissed.
but...
none of them have had my witness.
this is a very compelling case, Ellen.
are you sure Mr. Sanchez will cooperate?
Yes. He's assured me he will.
good girl. Good girl.
it was buzzing. I. D. says "Ellen."
Hey, Chris, it's me, calling to see how you're doing.
I pitched the case to the partners.
we should get an answer back soon.
call me back, okay?
who's Ellen?
no one.
friend from high school.
fire was caused by a gas explosion, which they believe to have originated in the office of an Upper West Side psychiatrist, Dr. Raul Barrera.
the 52-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the scene.
three firefighters also suffered minor injuries battling the blaze.
an investigation into the cause of the explosion continues.
reporting live on the Upper West Side, Tara Lynn Wagner, New York 1.
are you okay?
where are you going?
it was the same doctor I went to.
you think someone is targeting you?
I don't know, but I had an appointment scheduled this morning.
you need anything, Ellen? I can put on a pot of coffee.
I'm fine. Thank you, Kevin.
who referred you to this doctor?
a friend-- A. C.
does he work for High Star? - Yeah.
but you don't understand.
A. C. trained me, he saved my life, like, a half a dozen times...
the guy's like a brother to me.
does he know that you've been talking to a lawyer?
no.
does anyone at High Star know that we've been in contact?
no, I've told no one.
it's okay.
I need you to keep to yourself for a little while.
can you do that?
I don't want you talking to anyone from the company.
whatever you say.
I'm also gonna hire private security for you.
I don't need that.
just to make sure...
what, so I could have more guys with guns hanging around me?
I can take care of myself, okay?
I can take care of my fuckin' self.
Just...calm down.
I don't want anyone to know that you've been talking to a lawyer.
so we shouldn't be in contact until I have official word from my firm and we're ready to file a case.
fine.
once I have the resources, we'll figure out this explosion and exactly what is going on.
are you still willing to testify?
if it will help my guys' families.
that's what this is all about.
come on, Ghwarri. Come on, girl.
that's great. Thank you. Thank you, Sean.
okay, well... I'll see you back at the office. Yeah.
okay. Okay, bye.
sorry I'm late.
I had therapy.
therapy?
could I have a cup of tea, please? Thank you.
I thought you didn't believe in therapy.
Yeah, well, this is court-ordered.
it's all Perry's fault.
your doorman?
I was late for a meeting.
I was in the lobby waiting for him to open the door for me, and he just stood there, rambling on about the goddamn weather.
I pushed past him...
and the door hit him in the face.
I accidentally broke his nose.
accidentally.
the prick pressed charges.
the judge let me off provided I go to therapy.
anyway, listen...
I need a new nanny. - Still?
Where's Catherine? - In the office with my assistant.
do you know of anyone?
I mean, y-you must have friends who have kids.
in Jersey, sure.
but none of them can afford nannies.
Oh, God.
I'll be in your shoes tomorrow night
baby-sitting my niece when my sister goes Christmas shopping.
do you want to get them together? - Like a playdate?
I mean, it would, you know, give me a break and...
burn off some of Catherine's energy.
Yeah, could be good. Maybe.
Oh, thank you.
so, I pitched the High Star case to the firm yesterday.
you didn't take my advice.
have you convinced your friend to be a witness?
Yeah.
although it may have made him into a target.
do the people at High Star know that he's talking to you?
he says no, but the explosion uptown may have been meant for him.
your firm is never gonna let you try this case, Ellen.
why do you say that?
because ever since Hollis Nye retired, they have no backbone.
defendants like this terrify them.
you'll see.
they'll fold.
well, they already said yes.
Really? - Got the call before you came.
well...
good for you. I stand corrected.
and here I was talking about nannies.
I'm taking my witness's statement in the morning.
this is going to be a big step for you, Ellen.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I...I should run. I'm sorry.
I'll take care of this.
don't worry.
so you'll think about the playdate?
I will.
thanks for the coffee.
what the fuck were you thinking?!
I've sent dozens of my men to that shrink.
I trusted him!
I told you not to send Sanchez to a psychiatrist.
so you blast his office!
first of all, I didn't do anything to that poor doctor.
I saw it on the news, just like everybody else.
damn shame.
con Ed had the place all wired wrong.
you wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face.
I followed your wishes 100%.
you told me to stay away from Sanchez, and I did.
this stops right here, right now, you hear me?
nobody else gets hurt, do you understand?
I couldn't agree with you more, but that lawyer, Ellen Parsons, we need to find a way to keep Sanchez away from her.
what are you suggesting?
well, we could pay him, I suppose.
he's already turned down a promotion.
or threaten him.
he's one of my top employees.
look...
as long as he's in this country, there's no guarantees of us being protected.
now, the best move you could make is to redeploy him.
the kid's damaged goods. I can't send him back to a war zone.
I'm all ears. You got a better idea?
yeah?
Mr. Erickson.
mind if I step inside?
no, sir. Come on in.
I'm sorry, I-I'm just surprised to see you here, sir.
I know.
I wanted to talk to you face-to-face.
A. C. told me you've been going through a tough time.
Yes, sir.
I guess I have.
and then there's this explosion uptown.
can I get you a beer or something, sir?
sure, why not?
beer wouldn't do me wrong right about now.
thank you.
I'm very concerned about this whole thing.
A. C. got Dr. Barrera's name from me.
the doctor was an old friend of mine.
news said it was a gas leak.
I talked to several guys I know at the city's anti-terrorism task force.
they investigate these things.
they're certain it was a faulty valve.
listen, son...
I'm not sure I believe it myself.
I'm afraid someone's targeting the company somehow.
we got a lot of enemies.
I thought someone was maybe targeting me.
who would do that?
I don't know, sir.
but that last mission...
Yeah.
that was rough.
sometimes we come home, our trauma clouds our heads.
we start seeing the enemy everywhere.
but I can tell you this...
no one at High Star questions your loyalty.
well, I know, sir.
I'm sorry if I implied... - We're here to protect you.
I heard the families of my men got nothing from the company.
we're not the military.
those men signed the same contract as you.
there's no provision for death pay.
listen...
I know you turned down my offer a couple months back.
A. C. told me your mother's been sick.
so if you're having money troubles,
I'd be happy to put that offer back on the table.
you want me to redeploy?
only if it would help.
I can always use a man like you.
I'd be no good to you right now.
I really need to see a... a doctor.
I understand. And...
if you change your mind... - I'm not going back, sir.
all right.
I hear you loud and clear.
thanks for the beer.
we're a family, Sanchez. We've got your back.
you hear me?
thank you, sir.
you'll be a good girl at the office today?
okay.
these came for you. I think they're baby supplies.
thank you, Perry.
are you feeling any better today? - I'm not.
I think the weather aggravates my injury.
well, any day you'll be back to normal.
maybe. Maybe not.
call Jim Girotto.
I want to move the deposition again. - Got it.
and, uh, you'll continue to take care of Catherine in the office until I can find help.
you'll be bringing her to work every day?
Yes.
so make sure that she doesn't catch her little hand in a stapler. Or something.
and call someone. I want the whole office child-proofed.
okay. Uh, Mr. Huntley's waiting for you.
send him in.
I ran Michael's photo and personal information through the system.
and no hospital or morgue had any John Does that matched his description.
of course not, Mr. Huntley, Michael isn't dead.
he's running from his responsibilities.
right.
Oh, and also, um, he's not part of the prison system.
I-I checked that out.
how about money?
well, he...
I think two years ago...
two, yeah, two years ago, he, uh, withdrew $500 from an ATM uptown.
and that seems to be his last financial transaction.
he's never used his credit cards?
um, no, there's no record of that.
Oh, and, um...about your ex-husband.
is there any chance that Mr. Grey may have been helping your son out?
I've spoken to Phil.
michael hasn't contacted him.
well, he-he never contacted, uh...Jill Burnham, either.
I guess...I guess you forgot to, um, to mention her.
there's no reason to.
right, she's just the mother of his child.
not legally. I made sure of that.
right, so, um, you said that, um, the last time you saw Michael was three years ago.
now that's right around the time of your car accident, right?
Yes.
it's interesting.
you know, the timing. It's just...
what's next, Mr. Huntley?
Oh, I,um, I'd like to talk to his peers.
um, I'll need a list of his friends and any people that he socialized with.
I'm only aware of a few.
he was very secretive about his private life.
well, we'll start with the ones you know, and maybe that will lead us to some...some secrets.
I'll get you a list. Thank you.
thank you.
Ellen. - Hey, babe.
where you headed? - Picking up Chris.
bringing him in to take his statement.
Ellen, wait.
what's that look on your face?
sorry, I...I hate to tell you this.
what?
you said yes.
I told my witness we have a case.
we reconsidered.
why are you turning this down?
the inordinate cost in a case of this nature, both in terms of time and resources, is not in the best interest of the firm.
you're scared.
you're afraid of High Star.
ms. Parsons, I think you're mistaking naivet for courage.
nye, Everett has been around for, what, over 100 years.
thousands of clients and employees.
we're not going to risk getting sucked into some legal black hole that could put the very existence of this firm in jeopardy.
Hollis Nye would have backed me on this.
Mr. Nye isn't here anymore.
sometimes the better part of valor is to cover your ass and survive to fight another day.
that's not valor, sir.
that's chickenshit.
Ellen, hey. - Hey, Chris.
listen, there's been a change of plans.
we're not going to be taking your statement today.
why not?
I just need a little more time on my end to figure things out.
procedural stuff.
okay. Okay.
how are you doing?
I'm fine.
are you sure you don't want me to look into security for you?
Yeah, no, I'm good.
uh, so, we'll talk soon, I guess.
Yeah. Absolutely. Hang in there, okay?
what are you doing? You didn't tell him.
I'm not giving up.
there's no case.
maybe I'll try it on my own.
how? You have no resources.
Chris has put himself out there for me.
I-I can't just leave him dangling.
I'm not sure you have a choice.
there's a way to try this case, I just haven't figured it out yet.
Ellen, if you really want to do this...
yeah?
I hate to mention it, but...what about Patty?
what about her?
you haven't thought about it?
taking the case to her?
it's an option. - No. Not an option.
I would never ask her for help.
maybe if she offered, but...
I don't want to owe that woman anything.
ever.
yo.
thanks for coming.
I don't like to be too far from my place these days.
what's going on?
your boss came to see me.
Yeah, I know.
so you spoke with him.
that shit with Dr. Barrera hit him hard.
he wanted to see you, so I gave him your address. I hope that's okay.
Yeah, sure.
could I ask you something? - Of course.
I know you're tight with Erickson.
why is he so worried about me?
what do you mean?
is he afraid I'm going to talk about the mission?
fuck, no. I told him you're solid.
he's not afraid of you, Chris, he's worried about your health.
all right.
Thanks, I just wanted to hear it from you.
Hey. Want to grab a bite to eat?
there's a good Chinese joint up the block.
let's do it. Let me just get Ghwarri.
Yeah, how is she?
she's good.
fuck!
did you see where it came from?
across the street, fifth floor.
fuck!
fucking foreign cigarettes.
check it out.
is someone clocking you, bro?
who the fuck would be coming after you?
Kalashnikov.
I'm still kind of in shock.
I can't believe they turned down the case.
trust me, they didn't even consider it.
firms don't practice law, they calculate risk. I mean, you see it everywhere.
no one has the stomach for a case like that.
must have been difficult news for your witness.
I didn't tell him yet.
I thought I might try the case on my own.
you can't.
I know, I know, I'm...fooling myself.
I... I can't drag Chris through the fire without any resources.
and what would you do if you could find the resources?
I'd try the case.
you're right.
it's not going to happen.
finding resources like that is practically impossible.
looks like you've hit a dead end.
spit that out. Right now.
that's not for eating. Good girl.
why would a haji be targeting you in New Jersey?
maybe some kind of blowback from the mission.
what do you mean?
fuck, man, we didn't exactly make friends over there.
we killed Afghanis.
maybe it's coming back to bite me in the ass.
Chris, we gotta stay calm.
I want to talk with Erickson.
come with me back to the compound. You'll be safe there.
I-I can't. I gotta, I gotta go home.
no, you can't.
all my gear's there. My-my-my dog.
think about it. You're being targeted.
some sniper with a fucking Kalashnikov knows your routine.
you think they're waiting for me?
cause I'd love to meet 'em.
you're not going anywhere.
you're not in the right frame of mind, Chris.
I don't work for High Star anymore!
I don't have to take fucking orders from you, A. C!
As-salaam alaikum.
who are you?
you'll never know.
why don't you indulge me for a minute?
is that why we're here, to indulge you?
no, we're here so you don't end up with a felony battery on your record.
go on.
why don't you try answering a few questions honestly?
who knows?
if you cooperate, maybe we can cut the session short.
ask your questions.
who do you call when you're sick?
I don't get sick.
but if you did, if you wake up feeling, you know, violently ill, who would you call?
your husband's remarried, you don't speak to your son, so in whom do you confide?
my dog.
look, we can sit here and punch the clock for months, but it gets a little boring, don't you think?
it's very boring.
it's funny.
yeah?
there's a woman who used to work for me.
that you confide in?
no, no, I'm not talking about that.
this woman wants to try a case right now, and she needs my help to do it.
she wants it very badly.
I could help her.
I could give her everything she needs.
but I don't want to.
why not?
I'm not sure.
the arrangement could even benefit me.
but you deny her.
because I've already helped her enough.
I've done way too much for this girl.
well, maybe you see something in her.
at first she was just a means to an end.
should have cut her off as soon as she served her purpose.
but you didn't.
no.
and why do you think that is?
everything she has now is because of me and she still wants more.
you didn't answer my question.
why do you keep her around?
let's try this.
why do you want to kill Chris Sanchez?
I don't. Please.
No!
you want revenge, don't you?
that's why you want to kill him.
Yes, yes, yes! I-I've come for revenge!
what the fuck you doing here?!
Hey, Sanchez, you gonna let me in?
answer the question!
I came to warn you. You're in danger.
how do you know that?
I need you to take a ride with me.
Why?
look, Sanchez, if you don't trust me, bring your toolbox.
come on. It's in the back.
does this have to do with the mission?
I'm afraid so.
Mr. Erickson said the intelligence we got out of there paid off.
did it? - That's classified.
my fuckin' men were killed. I want to know.
Yeah, it paid off. Come on.
you can throw your guns down wherever you want.
you live here?
Ah, I do work here from time to time.
more like an office.
tell me what the fuck we're doing here.
come here. Come.
what you're about to see...
you never saw it.
you understand?
I understand.
who is this?
his name is Salam Fazel.
he was sent here to kill you.
this his? - Yeah.
who sent him here?
this man.
he's a mullah.
Taliban...Big deal with them.
unfortunately, on that last mission, you and your men killed his brother.
now he's looking for payback.
how do you know all this?
I'm tracking the fallout on that mission.
they've got this mullah on a watch list.
and his communications led us to this shitbag over here.
this guy wants revenge for the mullah's brother?
ask him.
you think I killed this man's brother?
you think I killed his brother?
you kill Nur Taraki's brother, now I kill you.
maybe I did kill him, but guess what?
you cocksuckers killed my men.
so fuck you.
relax.
I'm only telling you this 'cause we don't know how many of these scumbags are out there.
this mullah has access to cells in the States.
we've got to assume they're coming after you.
I think they already have.
what do you mean?
that explosion uptown?
I was supposed to be in that building.
then this cocksucker took a shot at me. Right?
right?
we found this.
it's a Kalashnikov.
is there somewhere you can go for protection?
mullah Nur Taraki.
supposedly we took out his brother, now he's coming after me.
and Boorman told you this? - Yeah.
if this mullah knows that you worked for High Star, then he could start targeting the whole company.
don't get too excited now.
Let's-let's be smart about this.
the way I see it, you should stay here at the compound till we sort this out.
you're safe here. No one can touch you.
or I could redeploy.
you told me yourself, that's not an option.
I want to go back over there and waste this mullah motherfucker before he gets to me.
if you want to do that, Chris, I'm going with you.
let me think about this.
Hey, I need to see you.
did you get my messages?
Yeah, I'd rather not talk on the phone.
I need your help. Can you come to my place?
I can be there at 11: 00, is that okay?
I'll see you then. - Great.
thanks for meeting me so last minute.
sure.
what's going on?
I wanted to let you know that I've decided to try the High Star case on my own.
I filed the case.
Ellen, you'll be crushed.
then I'll be crushed.
I'm not going to back down.
it's a terrible idea.
I have to try, Patty.
I think you should step back, regroup, find another case.
don't make us bring the war to you, bitch.
you all right?
not really.
this is what I'm going to be up against if I go through with this.
Howard Erickson has way too much to lose.
that's why someone has to take him down.
you said yourself that I can't try this case alone.
I know I did.
but I changed my mind.
if you back down now, you'll just be another attorney.
maybe that's all I am.
well, then you're at a turning point.
decide what you want.
I thought I had what it takes, but...
you're tougher than you think.
I'm not you, Patty.
I don't think I can live like this anymore.
let me help you.
help how?
use my firm, my resources.
I'm grateful, Patty, but no.
the case will be 100% yours.
I have no interest in interfering.
but I'll support you any way you want.
I don't know.
let me help you. I owe it to you.
my witness's name is Chris Sanchez.
I'll meet with him tomorrow.
Ellen, gang's all here.
Oh, hey, guys. You were fantastic.
Tony, scary as hell. I had no idea.
come on, I was a varsity linebacker.
very true.
you get what you need? - Yeah.
tequila shots.
drinks are on me. Seriously, much appreciated.
anything for Chris. - Cheers.
I would love to stay and get shit-faced with you guys, but I'm going to go see him.
appreciate it. Thanks again.
of course.
I am not a terrorist.
I know.
look, here's, uh... $10, 000.
sorry for the trouble.
why did you do this to me?
I love this country.
Really?
I'm not sure I do.
Chris, it's Ellen.
I have some good news...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey. Hey, Ghwarri.
hello.
hello. Where's Chris?
Where's Chris?
what the fuck is that?
possible IED on the right. I'm going to check it out.
Yeah.
we're here.
so what do we do now, look for some mullah that doesn't exist?
let him chase his tail for awhile.
okay, but, sir, he doesn't necessarily believe Boorman's story.
as long as he's over there, we're fine for now.
copy that.
we good?
all good. Let's do it.
hope that kid's going to be okay over there.
you're going to hear tomorrow, but a few congressmen have decided to change their votes.
Congratulations.
your contracts...Looks like they'll be renewed after all.
I appreciate it, Jerry.
see how it all works out when, uh, when we do things my way?
I thought you didn't believe in therapy.
Yeah, well, this is court-ordered.
you might as well talk to me.
we need to discuss how you ended up here, and then i have to sign off on your progress.
are you still taking care of your granddaughter?
Catherine's sick. she has a fever.
what's going on with this wrongful death suit against high star?
who else at high star knew about the program?
I've withheld nothing from you.
well, somehow, there's a new witness in town.
my name is nasim marwat.
on chris's last mission, three of his men were killed.
do you know the purpose of that mission?
every mission, they take someone away.
Chris explained this to my father, and now my father is dead.
if high star was running some sort of terrorist extraction program, they couldn't have done it alone.
the other american from chris's mission-- i saw him.
he was following me.
I need to get your testimony.
Mr. herndon can make some inquiries about high star.
you were able to confirm our witness's story.
high star was extracting terrorist suspects for the cia.
just keep the meter running; we'll be right back.
just grabbing his bags.
I need to borrow your hat.
get the fuck out of here.
and your cab.
all right, all right. whatever you want.
here's $1, 000. you'll have them both back in an hour.
Oh, and, uh... you can take that, too.
come with us, ma'am.
who are you?
sir, please step out of the car.
stay right where you are.
it's okay, ms. parsons. ms. hewes hired security for you.
you're gonna come with me.
it's okay. i know this man. he's with us.
let me just...
sir?
thank you for your trouble.
no trouble at all.
ms. parsons told me that you were followed earlier today.
Yes. the man from chris's mission is in new york.
we are taking every precaution to ensure your safety.
who is this man?
we don't know, but detective huntley will take your description of him, and we'll try to find out.
Yeah, i'd like to move you to a secure location.
we'll provide 24-hour protection.
I can't stay here anymore.
I would like to go back to my country.
are you still willing to give a statement, mr. marwat?
if it can be done quickly.
Absolutely. we won't keep you in new york any longer than necessary, and of course, this would be a great help to us.
let's get you some dinner and a bed.
it'll be safer this way.
thank you, mr. marwat.
thank you. we'll talk in the morning. thank you, detective.
you've reached howard t. erickson.
I'm not available to take your call.
please leave a message and have a blessed christmas.
give me a call!
Herndon was able to get this for us.
restricted access high star was conducting missions for the cia?
the operation is called dust devil.
when did herndon give this to you?
earlier tonight.
he lied to me.
he told me he couldn't get anything.
I... i think he just wanted me to see it first.
I think he's a little worried about you.
thinks you may be in over your head.
any information that you get, i want to know about it... immediately.
Ellen, i'm showing it to you now.
I couldn't call you on the phone, because we have to assume that all communications are compromised.
Huntley's gonna sweep the office for any bugs.
we won't use our phones or computers until we are absolutely sure that all lines of communication are secure.
dust devil.
dd.
dust devil"-- that's what it says on the back of chris' medallion.
Nasim must have witnessed one of the dust devil missions.
with his testimony and this document to back him up, you've got yourself a case.
I'm gonna begin drafting a motion that compels high star to deliver all of their documents on dust devil.
good. then we could start prepping marwat's deposition.
what do you mean there's another witness?
it's news to me, too. i found out, i called you immediately.
I was carving our christmas bird.
you said her entire case rested on chris sanchez's testimony.
it did.
as far as i knew, we were through that shit storm.
it's possible sanchez sent somebody back from afghanistan.
how do you know?
through a cia contact.
a friend?
I can't divulge my sources, jack. you know how that goes.
how would a source in the cia know anything about this?
I'm here to protect this company.
you have to tell me, howard.
I thought you didn't believe in therapy. - Yeah, well, this is court-ordered.

okay, when did it start? It's been a while now.
I need anything and everything that exists.
now listen, Jack, my friend in the agency is the man that guarantees I get my contracts renewed.
I can't betray his confidence in any manner.
of course not.
Yeah, buddy. You keeping an eye on your brothers?
Yeah, go ahead and start unwrapping them. I'm leaving right now.
all right.
it was a matter of national security.
highly classified. Up in the stratosphere classified.
understood.
get me all the paperwork on this thing-- E-mails, memos, whatever there is.
if Ellen Parsons produces this witness, I'll depose him, and we'll find out everything he knows.
still don't feel well?
Oh. Oh, you're burning up.
Catherine's fever went away for a couple of days, but, uh, it's come back.
that is slightly unusual, but there is a flu going around.
she's abnormally tired. She has no energy.
her check-up seemed okay.
I-I wouldn't get alarmed, but I'll run some blood tests, and the nanny should make sure that Catherine stays hydrated.
I don't currently have a nanny.
well, if you're interested, I could recommend a private nursing service.
there's a woman there who specializes in pediatrics.
she's wonderful with kids.
thank you. With the holiday and everything, - I should get the test results late tomorrow. - I understand.
there's nothing to worry about, Patty. Kids get bugs all the time.
it usually turns out to be nothing.
I'm looking for something crude, like an explosive with an arming switch that looks homemade or, uh, a cobbled-together pipe bomb.
what sort of locale are you thinking of? - A bus.
could retrofit a device with a little ignition generator. Nothing fancy.
exactly. - Sounds like a rerun of North Africa.
Yeah.
I was thinking the same thing.
you ever see that little tiki tiki girl?
no?
this is for you.
okay. I'm on it. I'll have it to you tomorrow.
Mr. Marwat, you asserted previously that you recognized this medallion. Yes or no, sir?
you must state your reply. - I'm sorry.
it's okay. Everyone forgets when they're nervous, but there will be a stenographer typing every word you say for the record, so it's important that you speak clearly.
do you recognize it? - Objection.
Yes, I do. Chris Sanchez wore it.
got to wait for the full objection.
sorry. - Objection. Previously asked and answered. You may continue.
would you kindly read what's on the back?
do you know what those initials stand for?
the DDs are what Chris and his men used to call themselves.
have you ever heard of Operation Dust Devil?
no.
so "DD" does not stand for "Dust Devil"?
no. I, uh...
no, it does stand for "Dust Devil," or no, it doesn't?
I'm sorry. I...
Mr. Marwat, to the best of your knowledge, does "DD" stand for Operation Dust Devil?
to the best of my knowledge, no, but...
so Chris Sanchez and his men had nothing to do with Operation Dust Devil?
I didn't say that. - Okay, so, let's stop here.
this is a trap Mr. Erickson's lawyers will set for you.
if they ask if "DD" stands for "Operation Dust Devil," just say, "I don't know.
this lawyer represents the company that may have murdered your father, so he will do whatever he can to try to confuse you.
it is very important that you take your time, and you don't let anyone rush you.
Yes. Okay. Please, let's keep practicing.
Catherine? Can you say hello to Ms. Auroro?
Hi, Catherine. Hi.
Oh, can I meet your friend? What's her name?
blueberry.
well, I can tell Blueberry watches over you and protects you, right?
ms. Auroro is going to stay with you today when I go to work, okay?
okay, Catherine, you close your eyes, and I'll be sitting right over there.
I'll see you when you wake up. There you go.
Oh, what a beautiful girl.
Oh, thank you. I'm so grateful you were available.
Oh, happy to help, Ms. Hewes.
God bless you, child.
parsons has requested every High Star document that references Operation Dust Devil.
what happens if we don't fork 'em over? - It's part of the discovery process.
they file a subpoena, the judge enforces it.
I'm not optimistic about our grounds for a challenge. - I see.
and they've put their witness on the list.
he needs to leave the country, so they're expediting his deposition.
my team's done an extensive review of all the company records Parsons has requested.
we cannot let Parsons get these documents.
so we'll just have to find another way to cut the balls off this thing.
I'll talk to my guy at the Agency.
but be careful. The CIA may be on your side now, but they'll throw you under a bus to cover their ass if they want to.
I know how the game is played, Jack.
that's a good girl, Catherine.
I'm going to take it out of your ear, and you are all done.
okay, let's tuck you in. Tuck you in and get you all cozy.
all right.
now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
see me safely through the night, and wake me with the morning light. Amen.
would you like anything to drink?
no, thank you. I should get home.
I'll be back first thing. 6: 00 a. m. is okay? Yes, thank you.
and, uh, I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't pray with Catherine.
we were just saying a good night prayer.
I understand. I'm not making any judgments.
but I'd prefer that Catherine not be exposed to it.
I have my faith. It's very important to me.
I respect that. And I hope you'll respect my wishes.
certainly. Were you raised in any faith?
Catholic. I was raised Catholic.
were you baptized?
I must have been.
but Catherine definitely wasn't baptized?
no.
thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.
why can't you just kick this up to your boss?
have him seal the Dust Devil documents.
classified and confidential. End of problem.
we can't get the Agency involved.
how the fuck did you let this guy slip through the cracks?
a little less volume, please. I'm working on a flu here.
you were responsible for knowing everything that happened on the ground over there.
don't worry about the deposition.
why not?! They have a witness, and we cannot let him be deposed.
I'm taking care of it.
I promise you, Parsons will not get this witness on the record.
is that what I asked for? - Yeah.
those are the only copies. What are you going to do with them?
protect my company. - How?
have a friend from the Department of Defense take a look.
he won't want to see that.
which is exactly why I'm going to show it to him.
I like it, Howard.
good. Suck a lozenge. And stop this deposition.
Patty, I heard from the lab.
what did they find? - Nothing definitive yet.
what are the possibilities?
I prefer to speak to you in person.
can you meet me at my office?
sure. I'll be right over.
have you taken Catherine to California or anywhere in the Southwest?
no. We haven't left New York.
what about your beach house? Have you taken her there?
no. Not since last summer. Why?
Lyme disease.
but this would be an unusually long time for it to present.
so if it's not that, what?
it could be as simple as mono. For a child?
you mentioned Catherine's been to your office regularly?
she's spent a fair amount of time around adults?
isn't there a very quick test for mono?
no. Children under four don't produce the heterophile antibody, so the test you're referring to will always return with a negative result even if the child's infected.
the only way to rule out mono is to check her liver enzymes.
so I have to wait for another test?
I'm afraid so, Patty.
very simple. Black powder, throw in some nails, roof tacks.
everything fits in the bag.
it detonates with a cell phone?
no need. You said it was better low-tech, right?
yeah...
this beaut will work, no questions asked.
most important, set the timer to ten minutes, turn off the kill switch and it's armed.
stash the bag, and get your ass out of there.
it won't work if the kill switch is still engaged. Copy that.
what?
I didn't say a word.
your worry takes up all the air. And it's making you sick.
no, no, there's a-- There's a flu going around.
and now you give it to me? You should have told me first.
I'm sorry.
I fucked up.
I, uh, I miscalculated the risk on an operation.
I didn't have all the intel.
what did it cost?
cost in terms of what?
lives.
I'm not sure yet.
okay. So, fix it or move on, but don't brood.
you're burning up.
why didn't you tell me you'd come to New York?
if I hadn't seen you, we'd have missed each other.
it was a last-minute assignment.
you know my agency. We make it up as we go along.
when did you let your hair get like this?
does that mean you like it?
no.
how come you never settled down, started a family?
the life I lead? What's the point?
you're getting old.
the mess I made
to fix it I'm going to have to do things I'd rather not.
14th Street.
the bus will now be making express stops only.
running express only from 14th.
I need to speak to your lieutenant. Everyone's going to be interviewed in a while, ma'am.
no, not in a while, now.
I think I might have been the target.
ma'am, there was 28 other passengers riding that bus.
typically an act like this doesn't target one specific person.
I understand.
what's atypical here is the nature of the case I'm involved in.
in my opinion, Agent Roseti, this could have been a threat against the firm.
detective Huntley is handling our private security.
you're NYPD? - Retired, yes.
anyway, why don't you bring me up to speed on the relevant details?
excuse me one moment.
yes?
I wanted you to know I got the test results back.
And?
I'm sorry, we still don't have clarity.
what do you mean?
I'm not happy with what I'm seeing.
I recommend ordering another round of tests.
so Catherine doesn't have mono?
no. She doesn't.
what's the worst case scenario?
leukemia, but we won't know anything for certain until the additional tests come back.
it can present in several different ways. - What are the odds?
I prefer not to think that way.
what are the odds that Catherine has leukemia?
based on what I'm seeing, the literature says there's a 2. 8% chance.
roughly one in 36 who present this way are positive.
Patty, are you there?
Yeah.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything. - All right.
anything you want to share about the waiting?
will sharing get me Catherine's test results any faster?
when you're feeling uncertain about things like this, do you tend to think the outcome will be positive or negative?
no answer?
it depends on the situation. - The situation we're talking about is Catherine.
do you fear the worst?
of course I do. I mean, wouldn't you?
you're angry. It was a stupid question.
anger often covers up other feelings.
fear, sadness, hurt.
you're here because of your anger issues, Patty.
can you at least acknowledge that you have a rather large capacity for anger?
when I'm asked a stupid question, yes.
I'm sorry.
Catherine's nurse asked if she was baptized.
was she? - I'm not religious.
so she wasn't. - No.
often people turn to religion in times like this.
it would make sense if waiting for the test results made you feel helpless.
and often when people feel helpless, it's common for them to turn to religion.
are you suggesting religion for me? - I didn't bring it up.
you're the one who talked about your granddaughter's baptism.
do you wish you could turn to religion now?
my mother was religious because she was weak.
that's interesting. Why do you think she was weak?
she couldn't stand up to my father.
so she felt helpless.
she did nothing to help herself. There's a difference.
maybe that's why she found religion. To help herself.
it was pathetic.
I think, um, religion for her was like a... insurance policy.
I have a civil suit pending against me.
I'm being asked to turn over High Star's records.
you sure you don't want something? They make a great Caesar.
no. I need your help.
I can't turn over my company's records, Trent. Neither can you.
Why? What's it got to do with the Defense Department?
it'll compromise national security.
I can't interfere with a civil case, all right?
you know how I stick my beak out for you when I can, but you're getting too much attention right now, Howard.
you should probably take a look at this.
the Defense Department's okay with that going public?
you weren't doing this on your own? - Of course not. I was helping out the Agency.
we kept D. O.D. out of it for obvious reasons.
but believe me, you guys benefitted from the intelligence.
I can't even count how many different ways this is illegal.
Trent, if this lawsuit goes forward, it not only gives me a black eye, but it'll blow back on the military and you guys will wind up with another Abu Ghraib on your hands.
help yourself by helping me.
I think Nasim is ready for the deposition tomorrow.
opposing counsel is Jack Shaw.
hired by Ashcroft to work for the D. O.J. during the Bush administration.
Yeah. He and Erickson share the same politics.
have you ever gone up against Shaw?
we appeared on a panel together once.
he's smart, measured, doesn't shoot off his mouth.
how's Catherine? The doctors made any progress?
no. One test just leads to another.
there's a one in 36 chance that she has leukemia.
if it's not that, it's another flu, or...
Jesus, one in 36. That's... kind of scary.
I grew up with a guy whose younger brother had some type of leukemia.
he was diagnosed age five. And he was fine, he made a full recovery.
happy holidays.
it's done, Howard. The documents have been taken care of.
shit.
shit.
this is bullshit.
Hello?
Patty, we can't use any of this.
by order of the Defense Department, it's all been redacted.
it's okay. We still have the deposition.
the bomb had enough juice to take out everyone on the bus, but it didn't detonate because the kill switch was still engaged.
well, thanks for keeping me apprised, Agent Roseti.
the guy screwed up.
we were able to find a strand of hair, and we're analyzing it for DNA.
how's it going in here?
I think we've got enough; it's a good sample. - What's our E. T.A?
we should be able to run this guy's DNA through the database in an hour.
what the hell is going on, Jerry?
my lawyer just left for Patty Hewes' office. The deposition's going forward.
I did my job. What the fuck are you doing?!
so, we'll, uh, sit together on this side of the table.
this woman will record all that I say?
Yes. And it's going to take several hours so if you get uncomfortable or you need a minute, just let either of us know.
good afternoon. - Jack.
pleasure to see you again, Patty.
ms. Parsons. Mr. Marwat, nice to meet you.
I'm Jack Shaw, opposing counsel.
it's okay. - Hello.
okay, let's have a seat, shall we?
listen up. We got lucky.
we found the suspect in the database.
we have a name, address and profile.
the suspect is to be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
??? Let's go!
thank you very much for appearing here today, Mr. Marwat.
I'd like to begin by asking you if you are familiar with any employee of the High Star Security Corporation.
Yes.
and what is the name of the employee that you allegedly know?
how would you describe your relationship with Mr. Sanchez?
Chris is my friend.
I see. So your friend worked for the company?
Mr. Marwat, you stated that you provided area maps for a High Star employee. Is that correct?
Yes.
do you know what those maps were used for?
to locate men suspected of terrorist activities.
okay, let's go.
what?
what do you believe a High Star employee would do if he located the type of man that you're referring to?
high Star employees would remove these men for questioning.
excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're going to have to stop.
what's wrong? What took you so long?
I stopped for a massage.
FBI. Nasim Marwat, you're under arrest.
what are the charges? Conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.
I've done no such thing. When?! He's been in protective custody.
this is not possible. - What the hell is going...?
he's not even in the system. Sir, excuse me.
I hacked into the fed database, no problem. - Good.
I was able to get your terrorist into the system.
didn't know if you, uh, needed this back.
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
how'd you get that anyway?
after he checked out of his hotel.
sir, thank you for your trouble.
no trouble at all.
I went into his room, found some hair in the wastebasket.
he must have shaved his beard after he came to the States.
I imagine he wanted to blend in.
one in 36.
keep moving.
meet my granddaughter.
michael had a chance to be a father and he ran away from it.
you still don't feel well?
Oh, you're burning up.
I recommend ordering another round of tests.
what's the worst case scenario?
leukemia.
what's this? - It's a medallion from my unit.
Mr. Herndon can make some inquires about High Star on your behalf.
high Star was conducting missions for the CIA.
the operation is called Dust Devil.
Nasim must have witnessed one of the Dust Devil missions.
with his testimony and this document to back him up, you've got yourself a case.
I can't turn over my company's records, Trent.
what's it got to do with the Defense Department?
if this lawsuit goes forward, it'll blow back on the military and you guys will wind up with another Abu Ghraib on your hands.
everything fits in the bag.
what sort of locale you thinking of? - A bus.
it didn't detonate because the kill switch was still engaged.
Nasim Marwat, you're under arrest.
what are the charges?
conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.
I've done no such thing.
I hacked into the fed database, no problem.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was able to get your terrorist into the system.
can anyone hear me?
anyone?
I don't need anything.
I'm okay. I just want to talk.
could I please talk to someone? Please?
please, brother, why are they doing this?
I've done nothing wrong.
shut the fuck up. I'm not your brother.
keep moving.
where is he?
Mr. Marwat is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Brooklyn.
he's my client. I want to see him.
that's not possible. Not yet.
Mr. Marwat may not be a citizen of this country, but he's entitled to due process.
he has the right to see counsel.
ma'am, at this moment, he's being interviewed by federal agents.
as you know, he is the prime suspect in an attempted act of terrorism.
Mr. Marwat assisted Americans in Afghanistan.
does that sound like a terrorist?
we have evidence connecting him to the crime scene.
what exactly is he charged with?
at this point, he hasn't been.
is he under arrest?
have you even Mirandized him?
they're not required to.
there was imminent danger to the public safety.
the law says he can be questioned without his attorney present.
thank you, Bill. We have this under control.
I was only saying.
so it's been 24 hours, and he hasn't even been read his rights.
not yet, ma'am.
agent Rosetti, when can I have access to my client?
once Mr. Marwat has been thoroughly questioned, you can talk to him as much as you want.
we'll notify you when we can grant you access.
you got him.
a clean shot.
I haven't had a good rabbit stew since my wife passed.
I think I'm going to cook this one up myself.
Howard, I can't tell you how happy I am that you're taking this land.
I mean, the idea of a Home Depot here. It just makes me sick.
well, I'm honored you accepted my offer, Ed.
well, you certainly gave me a good price.
my daddy bought this land back in the '30s.
the old factory's just right over that hill there.
who'd have guessed you could make a fortune off of gloves?
my dad made a pile on refrigeration.
no kidding?
Yeah, came over here from Norway without a kroner.
settled in Minnesota. Built an empire.
but, you know what, he never spent a dime on himself.
well, he wasn't interested in money.
he believed in the work ethic.
that's exactly right.
my dad used to say, "making a profit is God's way of thanking you for working hard."
God and country...That's what he was all about.
Amen.
well, let me ask you something, Howard.
how are things going over there in Afghanistan?
I'm not the government, Ed.
I don't choose where we fight.
I just send men over to help out where they're needed.
I can respect that, but...Now don't get me wrong...
I fought in Korea...
but this war's been going on for ten years.
and the Taliban is still over there farting falafel and our boys are dying.
Yes, sir.
it's been on my mind because my grandson is just finishing up at boot camp training, and his unit's going to be assigned any day now.
I see.
he joined up without his mother's permission.
my daughter's just terrified he's going to end up in combat.
it's a mother's job to worry.
I respect your grandson's desire to serve.
I'm just praying he stays out of harm's way.
you can add that little hopper to your stew, Ed.
I'm going to file a motion to get us access to Nasim.
it won't matter. - Why is he here?
I asked him to come, and he's right, it won't matter.
Nasim is finished as a witness. He's labeled a terrorist.
any shred of credibility he might have had is gone.
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.
I mean it's not like you guys are dealing with the CIA or anything.
you took away the decanter.
I knew you were coming.
you think the CIA set Nasim up?
your witness was arrested right in the middle of a deposition against High Star.
timely. - Howard Erickson could not have orchestrated this alone.
it had to be the CIA.
so now it's time to get very paranoid...
assuming they'll be listening in on every phone call you make.
I had the office swept. It was clean.
cell phones. - We got rid of them.
we're using new ones. - Good.
you still don't have a witness.
you ladies have any, uh, further leads, or are we finished here?
Nasim said there was another American on Chris's mission who wasn't with High Star.
I suspect he's CIA. - Absolutely.
if the Agency was running ops over there, they had to have someone on the ground.
Nasim saw this man in New York.
he can identify him...That's our lead.
you're gonna try to find a CIA operative in a city of eight million people?
good luck.
trust me.
he can be useful.
Nasim thought the CIA guy followed him from the mosque.
we could check the surveillance cameras in the area.
it's a long shot. Worth a try.
the government's paying over a hundred million to renew your contracts.
we need to know you'll be able to handle the workload.
I can assure you your money is not being wasted.
my apologies. Sorry I'm late.
no worries, Jack.
you know Trent Prowse from Defense.
of course. Good to see you. - Likewise.
Trent was just questioning our ability to fulfill our contracts.
as we draw down troops, our need for private forces will increase exponentially.
we'll require additional security, training for the Afghan police force...
we'd anticipated that.
but you've already got men in Iraq, Middle East, Africa, Japan.
you're not spread too thin? - Absolutely not.
the fact is, we're expanding...We're recruiting new men.
will you have the facilities to train them?
Jack, show him the thing.
Trent, you got to see this.
I got to show you something.
Thanks, Jack.
we're in escrow on this property here.
that's over 20, 000 acres.
now, we're converting this old factory into a new ops center, - doubling our training capacity. - I see.
two landing strips here for transport, and a new sniper range right there.
when can you start on all this?
we'll be breaking ground at the close of escrow, in seven days.
this looks good, Howard.
I'll bring this back to my people.
in the meantime... - Hello?
here's a complete breakdown of our anticipated needs.
um, I'm sorry. He's in a meeting.
one moment.
it's Ed O'Malley.
I should take this, Trent.
it's the man that's selling me the property.
I think we're done here anyway. Always a pleasure, Howard.
ed. How was that Hasenpfeffer?
I have to go to work now.
but Mrs. Auroro is going to be with you, and she'll call me if you need me.
okay.
she's warm.
Yes, but her temperature has been holding steady.
I'll call you immediately if anything changes.
Thanks.
uh, of course.
when will you hear from Dr. Weisler?
I'm expecting her test results at the end of the day.
I'll let you know.
ms. Hewes, your son, Catherine's father, does he know she's sick?
no.
perhaps you should tell him.
I don't know how to reach him.
so we're looking for the man who followed Nasim from the mosque.
do you think you could find anything for us?
well, the mosque may have security cameras, and I'm...
I'm sure there are some banks around there.
I-I can try to dig up some footage.
okay, great. I'll take anything you can find.
Dean Gulickson from the Times called again.
he wants to talk to you about the High Star case.
he's a fine reporter.
I read everything he's written on Afghanistan.
he knows the place inside out.
it's, uh, still a no. Thanks, Maggie.
I'm not talking to the press.
okay. I'll tell him.
um, I'll get on those tapes right away.
time to pray.
ms. Hewes, it's Dr. Weisner.
put her on.
Yes, it's Patty.
you have the results?
anything?
no.
I...I can't find Nasim, let alone someone who's following him.
are you okay?
I just got Catherine's test results back.
And?
she's fine.
you throw darts worse than you shoot a rifle.
man, you can't even shoot your load.
could if he was aiming at your sister.
stand aside, boys.
carry on, boys.
all right, try not to embarrass yourselves.
nobody pays tonight.
hope the bar is okay. It's a little loud.
ed here is 1st Marines. Landed at Inchon.
is that so?
pour him your best whiskey.
thank you, Howard.
you mind if we sit down?
did you get word on your grandson?
no, everything's fine there.
we got lucky.
his unit was assigned to Japan for humanitarian work.
that's great news.
what's on your mind?
it's my daughter.
she doesn't want me selling you the land.
we agreed on a price, but if she wants to renegotiate...
it's not the money; it's-it's...it's the politics.
she doesn't want the family property going over to a mercenary.
her word.
I see. - It seems there's a slew of lawsuits against your company.
all dismissed, Ed.
what about the one pending right now?
she said that some of your men were killed on an illegal mission.
is there any truth to that? - None.
all of my work is government sanctioned.
it's totally legit. That case is...
it's-it's a left-wing crusade against me.
well, my daughter is concerned.
it just doesn't sit well with her.
I don't want to butt in here, Ed, but, uh...
isn't the land yours to sell?
Yeah.
the truth is, Howard, it doesn't sit well with me, either.
now, I've got commitments based on my acquisition of that land.
and I'm sorry, Howard.
no. We had a deal.
we shook hands.
I-I didn't have all the facts.- Facts?
you have no idea what the facts are.
Howard... - The men I train protect Americans.
lives are at stake here.
forgive me, Ed, but your daughter doesn't have the first fucking clue about what's going on here!
I'm sorry, Howard.
the deal's off.
ms. Hewes? - Yeah.
there's someone here to see you.
he says he's your son.
I am her son.
you can go home, Maggie.
please shut the door.
new assistant. She's cute.
are you going to offer me a drink or anything?
no, I'm not.
I heard you were looking for me.
Yeah.
here I am.
do you expect a hug or something?
I wanted to apologize.
I'm sorry for disappearing.
I just needed to sort some things out for myself.
is that it?
because, if it is, I need to get home.
I want to see my daughter.
after three years of neglect, you suddenly care?
how is she?
she's perfect.
so can I see her?
I understand if you need to think about it.
here's my information.
let me know your answer.
have a good night.
we never really talked about your case last night.
how's it going?
well, the CIA is now involved, and my witness has been arrested as a terrorist.
shit. - Yeah.
is he a terrorist? - No, he was set up.
sorry, this is me.
did you get a new cell phone? - Yeah.
we think someone's been listening in on our calls.
and I have my old phone here.
shall we crank-call the CIA?
can you still make dinner? - Uh, I'll try.
Hey, you're in the weeds right now.
whatever you can swing is fine with me.
thanks for being so understanding.
okay. - Okay, this is me.
okay, well, bye, babe.
help me, please. I need to speak to my lawyers.
stop talking. - I am innocent.
my family needs me.
where are you from?
Brooklyn, NYC. Born and bred.
but your family.
I heard someone call you "Reza."
that is Iranian, yes?
my family left Iran a long time ago.
are you a Muslim? - Eat.
I'm begging you. Please help me.
look into my eyes.
I'm like you.
I am an innocent man.
look, asshole, you're not like me.
I'm not a terrorist.
Hey, Asgari, your shift's up.
I just gave him dinner.
I was told an official would be coming by later to see the prisoner.
Oh, thanks.
how far'd you get?
did about half of it.
17 across is a bitch, though.
six letters. See if you can get it.
it's not "if," my friend, but when.
have a good one. - Yeah.
hello.
I need to talk about the case with you.
anything the matter?
I'd rather not discuss it over the phone.
can you meet me in a half hour at the park on 15th?
Yeah, I'll be there.
agent Rosetti called.
Nasim's being Mirandized at 1: 00. We can talk to him this afternoon.
great.
so, what's so urgent?
I wanted you to take a look at this.
very interesting.
do you think it's true?
well, if it is, it could answer a lot of questions for us.
you purposely called me on your old phone.
this guy must have been listening in on my calls.
that is the only way that he could have tracked Nasim.
very smart, this one.
so I thought I'd lure him to the park.
did you notice anyone watching us?
I wasn't looking.
but I had someone taking photographs.
he's actually quite useful.
what are we looking for?
could be anyone.
I mean, just because you made the call doesn't mean the guy was listening.
or that he showed up.
you don't even know if your phone was tapped.
my bet's on him.
my money's on the kid with the skateboard.
the CIA are sneaky little bastards.
Nasim knows who we're looking for.
he's being Mirandized today.
we'll bring him the photos and hope he can make an I. D.
you're white as a as a sheet.
I'm just getting over the flu.
did you know about this guy?
no, sir, but I should've.
an Afghan tries to blow up a New York City bus.
you're goddamn right you should've.
he wasn't on any list.
he slipped through the cracks.
no one's heard of this fuck.
I got guys in seven countries trying to round up intel on him right now.
it's a little fucking late.
the device Marwat used had a kill radius of more than a hundred feet.
lucky for you the asshole forgot to arm the damn thing.
have the Feds questioned him?
Yeah, but they got nothing. They'll be arraigning him today.
it's a bad idea.
we need to hold this Marwat.
let's not give him a chance to lawyer up.
the DOJ isn't the Wild West anymore.
he's entitled to a speedy trial, access to counsel.
the longer he's in custody, the longer he's not communicating with any accomplices on the street.
I fucked up.
let me set it straight, spend some time alone with this guy.
see what I can get out of him.
how do you suggest we hold him?
drop all the charges.
and then?
lock him up on immigration violations.
then we can keep him away from his attorneys as long as we need.
I run this up the flagpole, it comes back to fuck me, you'll be next.
you gonna make the call or not?
Dean Gulickson from the Times called again.
can you tell him no?
I already did.
car's waiting to take you and Patty to Mr. Marwat's arraignment.
great. - We won't be needing the car.
what happened?
Nasim's arraignment has been canceled.
the government has dropped the conspiracy charges against him.
just like that?
now they're holding him on an immigration violation.
which means that we don't have access to him.
he's denied the right to attorney.
they can just do that?
well, it seems like these people have the power to do whatever they damn well please.
we need Nasim to I. D. the guy in the park.
I'll keep helping with this, Ellen, but only if you're willing to go all the way.
I am.
all right, then.
let's get Agent Rosetti back in here.
I spoke to O'Malley and his daughter.
And? - I offered them the amount we discussed.
they won't budge. More money's not gonna do it.
did they even counter? - Howard, there's no negotiation.
it's the principle of the thing, and you can't negotiate with principles.
no matter how upside down, pretzel-twisted and jack-fucked those principles are!
they don't want to sell because of case against you.
this fucking case!
do we have any options?
I checked into the Bruer Farm and the golf course.
no one wants to sell.
at this point we're hemmed in. - Unacceptable!
do not speak my language.
have you told anyone about me?
I don't know you.
but you saw me outside the mosque.
Yes.
what do you know, Nasim?
what did Chris Sanchez tell you about me?
we know where you live, Nasim.
I'm worried about your wife, your children...
without a man around to protect them.
shame what happened to your father.
now, I can help you get home, but you're gonna have to tell me the truth.
I saw you once in Afghanistan.
but Chris told me nothing about you.
when did you see me?
just before the mission where Chris's men were killed.
what were you doing there? - I would scout the area for Chris.
did you tell the lawyers that you saw me over there?
Yes.
did you tell 'em saw me in New York?
Yes, I told them, but they don't know who you are because I don't know who you you are.
okay.
I believe you, Mr. Marwat.
please send me home.
I beg you.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
you're being held here on immigration violations right now.
I'm gonna get you deported.
that will get me home?- Lickety-split.
I'll just need you to sign some documents to waive your right to speak to an attorney or claim political asylum.
I will sign anything. - Good.
I'll be back with the documents.
but Nasim, if you ever tell anyone about me,
I'll kill your whole family.
guard?
so how are you going to find this CIA guy?
I have no idea.
and you still can't get access to your witness?
he hasn't even been read his rights.
it's beautiful.
can you believe he did that to her in public?
well, she looks pretty happy.
because she has to be.
she has an audience.
so you don't like public displays.
that's too bad because...
I was going to ask you...
if you wanted a mint.
you're an asshole.
Oh, Jesus!
your expression was priceless.
because you scared the shit out of me. - Don't worry.
I know how you feel about marriage.
it's just not for me; not right now.
do you think that you don't want to get married because of what happened to your fianc?
I mean, you don't have to talk about it, if you don't want to.
no, it's fine.
his name was David, right?
Yeah. David.
how'd this get in here?
I don't know.
maybe it's got something to do with him, yeah.
I was a different person.
you know, it was another time.
is that a good thing?
it doesn't really matter.
Yeah. I can't change it.
can I come in?
sure.
out late last night?
my job keeps me up.
so, have you thought about it?
Yeah. I have.
can I see my daughter?
about three weeks ago, I went up to Boston.
what brought you up there?
I was looking for you.
while I was there, I bumped into your old friend Henry Thain.
how's he enjoying college life?
he led me to the sleazy little place where you used to deal drugs.
I needed a way to get on my feet, which I have, by the way.
doing quite well.
I don't know what kind of life you're living, but you're not fit to be a father.
I'm not going to let you see Catherine.
that's her name?
how did you choose that?
I'm not gonna let her meet you, so you can just run off again.
it would be cruel.
I'm not running anywhere.
well, if you want to see her, just convince me you've changed.
until then, come within 100 yards of her, and I'll get a restraining order.
I'm sorry that's your position.
but...
you have been taking care of her, and-and I'm grateful for that.
so, I guess I have to respect your feelings.
can anyone hear me?!
can I please fucking talk to someone?
miss Parsons?
Dean Gulickson from The Times.
have a seat.
thanks for agreeing to talk to me about the case.
I haven't agreed yet. - I see.
how often are you in Afghanistan?
most of the year.
the story I have...
it goes way beyond just a civil action against High Star.
how far beyond?
extraordinary rendition, CIA, innocent man being framed as a terrorist.
that's pretty far.
I can give you all of it if you do something for me.
I'm listening.
there's a High Star employee over there...
and he's missing.
or he's been killed.
either way, I want you to find him.
what if I can't?
well, then you don't get the story.
Hey, have you seen the mock-up of the new Excalibur drone?
it's got 400 pounds of laser-guided munitions.
it can hit a cabbage from 600 miles away.
it's still a few years away from production, though.
Yeah, well, I can't wait to see that baby in action.
you'll be among the first.
listen, I was talking to the secretary about your expansion plan.
he's confident you can handle the job.
well, he's a smart man.
provided you're able to stick to your construction schedule.
Yeah, no problem doing that.
listen, um, I actually called you up to ask you for a favor.
yeah? What can I do for you?
I was wondering if we could discuss some troop deployments.
what do you have in mind?
what the hell is this?
it's a record of Mr. Marwat's activities.
you'll see that he's being well taken care of.
that's not what we asked for.
this is a lunch menu.
8: 00 a. m. breakfast. Mr. Marwat is given oatmeal, scrambled eggs and a pineapplejuice, attested to by Guard Frank Bishop.
it's a daily record of all his meals, his exercise time.
you'll see he's allowed to pray five times a day.
that is not the information we asked for.
we need to know which organizations are questioning him, how long the interrogations last, and what methods are being used.
you know that's classified. We can't give that to you.
well, this is useless.
I'm afraid that's all I'm able to provide.
I'm sorry, Ms. Parsons.
everything we need in there?
Yeah. This should do it.
courtesy of the Dominican Republic.
everybody talks about the Cubans, but the Dominicans make the superior cigar.
no, thank you. - You sure?
I'm sure.
what can I do for you, Ed?
my grandson's unit has been reassigned to Afghanistan.
the Arghandab Valley.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know how much you and your daughter were afraid of that.
you got him sent over there, didn't you?
of course, it might be good for him.
combat changes a man.
deepens him.
from the minute he wakes up in the morning, he knows that day could be his last.
heightens the senses.
I'm asking you, man to man...
did you have my grandson sent there?
on the other hand,
I wouldn't want any of my sons over there right now.
that particular area is getting more dangerous by the day.
cut the crap, Howard!
place is crawling with snipers...
IED's, RPG's.
hell, I heard things are so confused over there right now, some of our boys are getting hit with friendly fire.
are you saying what I think you're saying?
this is a war, Ed.
anything is possible.
I really think you should consider that.
what good is a piece of land if you have no family to share it with?
Jesus Christ!
my answer is...yes...
I did get your grandson sent over there.
and I can pull him out.
it's up to you.
thank you for meeting with us.
we were given a list of Mr. Marwat's daily activities, and of all the guards posted to his detail, you seem to be the one who had the most contact with him.
Yeah, probably.
we believe Mr. Marwat is innocent.
and the man that framed him for the crime is in one of these photographs.
has anyone from these pictures come to talk to Mr. Marwat?
do you...recognize anybody? Take your time.
no, I-I don't recognize these people.
no.
you work the day shift, 8:00 a. m.to 8: 00 p. m. Is that right?
that's right.
would you be willing to take in these photographs to Mr. Marwat...
give him a chance to identify the man that we're looking for?
are you nuts?
you want me to bring this to a terror suspect?
you'd be compensated. - Whose side do you think I'm on?
anyway, I get frisked every day when I go to work.
I get caught with these on me, I'll lose my job.
just meeting with you could get me jammed up.
then why did you agree to it?
you're the only guard who would speak to us.
Why? - I guess, uh, the others aren't as stupid.
or is something about this not sitting quite right with you?
have you spoken to Mr. Marwat?
a little, sure.
in your experience, does he behave like someone who could possibly be a terrorist?
I gotta go.
Mr. Asgari...
if anyone from these pictures comes to talk to Nasim...
please, just let us know.
excuse me, sir.
I'm here to see Marwat, Nasim.
six fuckin' letters.
Hey, Asgari.
Hey, Tommy, stay out of trouble, huh?
you're late. - Eh, two minutes.
had to make a pit stop.
I still can't find this bitch.
all I know is the second letter's a "U."
cupcake.
Nah, seven letters. Doesn't fit.
I need to speak to the detainee.
good to see you again, sir. - Yeah.
muffin.
17 across, it's "muffin."
quiet, man, the prisoner is being questioned.
sorry.
Muffin." "Muffin" fits.
this is the guy. He came to see Mr. Marwat.
are you sure? - Definitely.
I saw him last night.
thank you so much.
you'll be compensated, as promised.
keep the money; I just hope I'm right about this.
you are. He's innocent.
then get him out of there.
how's the weight?
you know, I don't hunt very much, so it's hard to say.
well, you could use a . 22, but since we're walking rabbits, that shotgun'll make it easier for you to snap shoot.
right.
any word on flight restrictions?
I'm in contact with the FAA as to fixed-wing aircraft, but helicopters are no problem.
good, good.
nice piece of property.
she'll make a beautiful compound.
what changed O'Malley's mind?
he wanted to do his part for the war effort.
some people, Jack, you give them enough time, eventually they'll see the light.
we have a face; now we need a name.
I'll call Bill, see if he can help us.
ms. Hewes, this came for you.
what is it?
a summons.
Michael's suing me for custody of Catherine.
can anyone hear me?
anyone? I just want to fuckin' talk!
I just want to talk!
open the fuckin' door!
can we please talk?
I saw your client on Charlie Rose; his English is better than his French.
Mr. Coupet, did you personally oversee the development of a vaccine called Tranzec?
he's my only child. He left me with his baby daughter to take care of.
Michael's suing me for custody of Catherine. - You think the CIA set Nasim up?
your witness was arrested right in the middle of a deposition against High Star.
had to be the CIA.
assume they'll be listening in on every phone call you make.
this is the guy. He came to see Mr. Marwat.
are you sure? - Definitely.
you were responsible for knowing everything that happened on the ground over there.
I saw you once in Afghanistan, just before the mission where Chris' men were killed.
did you tell the lawyers? - Yes, I told them, but they don't know who you are.
why didn't you tell me you'd come to New York? - It was a last-minute assignment.
I'm worried about Chris Sanchez. Who knows what he's going to say in court.
he doesn't have to say anything if he doesn't appear. Afghanistan is a war zone, Howard.
anything can happen.
I seen you before.
what were you thinking about?
no, nothing.
you were talking about the incident, and then you just drifted away.
the incident"?
why don't you just walk me through it again? Step by step.
I was leaving for work.
I stepped out of the elevator and entered the lobby.
my doorman started to talk to me.
he was going on and on about the weather, and I was trying to ignore him, because...
because? Because what?
because I was on the phone.
who were you speaking to?
Yale Law School.
and what was the conversation about?
my law partner, three years ago.
he died.
Tom. I was trying to set up a scholarship in his name.
that's nice. Were you able to?
no.
got caught up in red tape and university politics, so...
anyway, that was the call I was making. - So maybe that's why you were angry.
Tom... Tom was obviously very important to you.
well, at your age, leaving a legacy... starts to become important.
you start thinking about your mortality. - Mortality?
how old do you think I am?
it's not your age I'm talking about, it's more this...
this phase in your life, where you've become extremely successful.
powerful. Mastered your profession.
it becomes important to kind of pass that on.
so, what would you like to do next?
well, I don't spend much time thinking about what's next.
but I'd imagine that you'd like your firm to live on, after you've stepped away.
well, my son would have made a brilliant lawyer.
he has a first-rate mind. But he refuses to use it.
he's suing me for custody of my granddaughter.
is there anyone else? - Nope.
you've spoken in the past about a young attorney. A woman.
you weren't sure why you were keeping her around. - Yeah.
did you ever end up helping her? - I did.
well, that's interesting.
go, come on.
that whole side will be demolished to make room for the new barracks.
are you guys going to use dynamite? - Doubtful. Probably bulldoze it.
can I drive the bulldozer? - We'll see, bub.
I brought you guys to see this before it was demolished so when we come back, you'll understand what hard work means. What progress is.
because if you're not moving forward in life, boys, you're moving backwards.
there's no in-between. You understand? - Yes, sir.
what is it?
Hey, guys? Guys, don't go in there! Boys, don't go in there! Come back. Come back!
his name is Chris.
what are you doing here? - Your dad brought me.
did you do something wrong?
your father thinks I did. - What did you do?
ask your dad.
what did he do, Dad? - I don't know this man.
guys, come here. It's okay,
I...I just want to tell you something.
your dad... is gonna kill me.
dad?
Hey, pal. - What's wrong?
I just dozed off for a minute; I'm all right.
how'd it go? - Well...I won.
won what? I thought this was just a practice.
no, today was the wrestle-off. - right.
Yeah, I finally beat Dravecki! I'm gonna be in the meet on Friday, Dad.
you'll get to see me in competition now. - Yeah, I might be able to make that.
what do you mean, might?
I have some things going on at work. This isn't a great time.
okay.
let's go get some chow.
how long have I been here? - About a month.
I'm worried about my dog.
you think you could find out how she's doing?
I left her with Ellen Parsons. - You think we're going to talk to your lawyer?
I'm just asking about the... my dog.
sorry.
where does this end, A.C?
you gonna kill me?
cause you-you can't keep me in here forever.
of course you don't know how it ends.
of course,'cause you just take orders from Erickson.
you're like his fucking slave.
fuck you.
you must be getting paid a fuckload? - I don't work for him for the money.
you think what we did is helping win the war?
dust Devil was about national security.
when I put you in charge of that unit, you said you understood that.
you told me that you were committed.
why you gave me this?
because we had an understanding that we'd do what it takes.
I got those for my men.
I gave it to you 'cause I thought you were one of us.
you're not.
you don't have any fucking men.
Erickson never told you who we pulled out of that last mission, did he?
you know I never asked.
because it's not my job to know.
so this is the guy? You sure?
he was seen at the detention center questioning Nasim Marwat.
then, lo and behold, Nasim gets deported.
can you get his name for us? - You want me to out a CIA agent?
this is dangerous territory. My advice is forget about this.
well, that's not an option. - What do you hope to get out of it?
you can't beat the CIA. Believe me, I tried.
bill, if you can get information on this man, we may be able to pressure him into turning against Howard Erickson.
so not just a name you want. You want dirt against this guy?
anything you can get.
we know that you have a contact at the agency.
I'm not-- I'm not going to promise anything. I mean, you guys are nuts.
did he really try and take on the CIA?
15 years ago, Bill went down to D. C.on a corruption case involving the Pentagon.
then he realized the CIA was involved. - What happened?
he took them on. They pushed back hard. They played dirty.
eventually, he realized that he'd have to do the same thing. So...
he concocted false evidence.
was caught.
and that's why he was disbarred? - Yeah.
yes? - Miss Hewes, your car is here.- Thank you.
I'm afraid I'm not going to be around much the next couple of days.
pharmaceutical case? - Yeah, I can't put it off any longer.
the trial date's coming on, and I have to keep moving on the depositions, so...
no problem. I'm fine.
I've got a meeting with the plaintiffs, and hopefully Bill will come up with something.
so, I'll let you know.
Jesus! Who the fuck is that?! - Our target. We're pulling him out.
he's got valuable information.
make sure the perimeter is secure. We're taking him out of here.
it's just you and me, you know.
I have a deposition to go to. I don't have a lot of time.
you asked me here.
I got your summons.
you do not want to sue me for custody. - Of my own daughter? I think I do.
I asked you nicely if I could meet her. You said no.
you left me no option. - Michael, you will lose.
you will be humiliated. It will probably destroy you.
I'm not going to lie down for you.
you deserted your child.
face that reality and live with it.
do you think you're facing reality?
have you really thought this through? - I'm late.
nothing more to say. - What if you die?
if something happens to you, who's going to take care of Catherine?
and when she gets older and asks about her dad, what are you going to tell her?
you lied to me about my father until I was almost out of high school.
I know how it feels.
that was a totally different situation. - You don't get to make the rules, Mom.
there's the law. And I'm going to use it to get what's mine.
see you in court.
I missed Christmas and her birthday.
it's small, but I was hoping you would give this to Catherine for me.
an economist at the state college said that the expansion's going to add a thousand news jobs to the local economy.
you sound like a man who's considering a run for elected office, Howard.
politics? Not on your life. - Hallelujah.
none of this would have been possible if you hadn't have gotten those contracts renewed.
just holding up my end of the bargain.
the agency is grateful for your assistance.
so that witness-- We're in the clear now?
Mr. Nasim Marwat has signed a statement denying any knowledge of the mission, - in exchange for a ticket home. - You had him deported?
gone! Bye-bye. You should have no problem getting the case dismissed.
there's still Chris Sanchez.
either he agrees to keep his mouth shut, or he doesn't.
there's no in between. - Yeah, I know.
sooner or later, you got to figure out what to do with him.
flowers for me?
this is a cemetery, so try to look like you're here for a reason. And, walk slowly.
so is your contact willing to help us?
he wants to see you first. He wants to know who he's dealing with.
okay, well, when can I see him? - He's right over there.
well, what are you waiting for? Go ahead.
Christ, are you even out of law school?
bill didn't tell me there was an age requirement.
if Patty Hewes didn't have your back...
I wouldn't even be talking with you. - Good to know.
can you help me or not?
understand what we're talking about here.
if I give you information about this man and anyone finds out, I will lose my job.
I'll be branded a traitor and very likely go to jail.
I won't go public with the information.
I can't even use it in court. - Then what do you want it for?
to get to High Star. Howard Erickson is my target.
my involvement can never be disclosed.
we never met. We never spoke. We never had any contact whatsoever.
understood.
can I ask you a question? Why are you doing this?
I'm doing it for Bill. He and I have helped each other for years.
it can't just be that.
I believe in the CIA.
I would not have spent my entire working life there if I didn't. This country needs it.
but I do not believe in corruption.
the agency needs to be cleaned up from time to time.
so, what next? - We'll meet again when I have something for you.
okay. Thank you.
bill and I shouldn't be seen together, so next time, come alone.
the phone itself is fine.
the diagnostics on the software
let's see-- Clean.
the tap is definitely still on and running.
what's your concern? - No one's using the line.
parsons hasn't talked to anyone in days. - You think she made you?
could be.
listen, I need to ask another favor. - Shoot.
just in case, can you keep an eye on things at the agency for me?
anything in particular? - See if anyone pokes around my files.
someone leaked info on an operation I was running a while back called "Dust Devil.
you got it. - Thanks.
it was incredible. It really was. Had a magical...
you know, we agreed to do this in New York, Patty. You could at least be on time.
why is the stenographer waiting in the hall?
I asked her to. Mr. Coupet would like a moment before we begin.
ms. Hewes, s'il vous plat.
this legal action is unpleasant for us all. - Unpleasant?
people are dead... as a direct result of your drug trials.
that hasn't been proven. - Forgive me, Ms. Hewes.
we recognize this is a tragedy. We are prepared to admit our mistakes.
Yes, you will. I'll make sure that you do.
ms. Hewes, the medications that my company provides save millions of lives around the world.
but development of new cures has been paralyzed by this litigation.
you mean your profits have been paralyzed. - It is true.
the company is very large.
our business represents a significant portion of my country's economy.
much is at stake.
it is essential to my government that we put this case behind us.
so Mr. Coupet has been empowered by his board of directors and the French Ministry of Health to offer your clients a settlement.
we propose the amount of 343 million euros.
that's half a billion dollars, Patty. It's more than generous.
Alors... you are amenable to this, Ms. Hewes?
I have only two days to depose you. Get the stenographer. You've already wasted ten minutes.
you here on the same assignment that brought you here before?
no, this is a vacation. My agency gave me time off.
and you came to see me? - No, I was bored of Paris.
when we were together last...
you asked why I never, never settled down.
and now you have an answer?
don't think I was ever really ready.
you ever think about being a mother?
not with a man who has so many secrets.
play your cards right, you just may learn a couple of them.
I have secrets, too.
I'm sure they're a lot more interesting than mine.
I could learn yours if I really wanted to.
we have our own techniques...
and I'm not afraid to use them.
you promise?
are you warm enough, honey?
we can't have you catching cold.
there we go. - Hello there.
Hi.
yes? - I like your shoes. They're very bright.
what do you say? - Thank you.
you're welcome.
you know, I have one of my daughter's friends with me. Can he say hello?
hello there. - Hello.
how are you today? - Good.
I think he likes you. - Yeah.
all right, Catherine, let's... Let's give it back.
that's all right. She can keep it.
thank you, but we, we can't accept this. - Really, it's all right.
it was nice to meet you, Catherine.
can I have the panda, please? - yes. Well, here you go, there he is.
I'm heading over to Afghanistan.
I'd like to get your latest intel. I want to see what's happening on the ground over there.
well, I'll see what I can dig up.
what's the sudden urge to go back to the sandbox?
I need to make an appearance, check on my men.
with all the new contracts coming in, I want to make sure everything's tip-top.
and I want to see Sanchez. - see Sanchez? What's the point?
I want to look him in the eye...
one Marine to another... make him understand.
well, I guess that's up to you, but...
I think you're just delaying the inevitable.
he's one of my men. I got to give the kid a chance.
it'll be harder to do once you see him again.
Sanchez understands the chain of command; he's just a little lost. I think I can bring him back.
you're taking a risk going over there.
my best advice is to keep your distance from him.
I really don't need you telling me how to run my men.
you mean your employees, don't you?
I'm heading out early on tomorrow. I really would appreciate that intel.
all right, all right, I'll make some calls.
why don't you ditch that thing and we'll go in and have a drink?
outstanding.
Mr. Coupet, is it common practice for your vaccines to be tested in third-world countries?
all pharmaceuticals must be tested in clinical trials.
please instruct your client to answer the question.
all right, you can answer. Consider him instructed.
Yes, we conduct trials in third-world countries.
because impoverished, uneducated people make more compliant subjects, is that right?
no.
because many third-world governments will happily take a bribe to look the other way?
no. - Mr. Coupet, were you aware that the man you hired to conduct trials on the vaccine, Tranzec, - failed out of veterinary school? - Two decades ago.
he's now a very well-respected researcher.
Mr. Coupet, are you a member of the extreme-right French ultra-nationalist political party, - le Front National? - I was, briefly. Not anymore.
what the hell does my client's political affiliation have to do with this case?
Tranzec was tested using poor, illiterate children as guinea pigs.
and the research was conducted by a person who wasn't even qualified to care for animals.
now, does that kind of callous, unethical experimentation remind you of...
anything? - Do not compare me to the Nazis.
you did... Mr. Coupet, not me.
- You know, I speak a little French, Mr. Coupet.
and just because that little outburst wasn't in English doesn't mean it's not gonna be on the record.
well, what did he say? Tell me what you... what-what did you say?
he called me a manipulative bitch. You get that?
Please...may we go off the record? - Certainly.
we will increase the settlement offer to $650 million.
absolutely not.
daddy's home, boys! - Hey, welcome back, sir.
damn good to be back, A.C. Feels good breathing in that dust again.
you know, Barkowski. - Sure I do. Good to see you again.
you, too, sir. - So, how was your trip?
the road in was a little hairy, as usual. Aside from that, I got nothing to complain about.
the guys are gonna be happy to see you-- It's good for morale.
Barkowski, would you mind stepping out for a second? - Of course, sir.
how's Sanchez? - Not good, sir.
I want to talk to him.
I'm home!
how is everyone?
good.
wonderful. We had a play date with the boy downstairs today.
they got along very well.
well, that's good to hear.
where did she get that?
we were out on a walk, and a nice man gave it to her.
she's crazy about it.
a nice man.
he had a kind face.
said he had a daughter of his own.
I'm surprised you'd take a toy from a stranger.
I don't want it in the house.
Hey, hey. Come on.
yo, hey, come on. Let's get up!
let's get out of here!
Hey!
come on, this is not your goddamn living room.
Jesus Christ, this fucking city!
Hey, schmuck, want me to call the cops again? I'm talk...
Yeah. - Your problem's been solved.
what's wrong?
he's not coming.
I'm in the middle of the deposition. What's going on?
he's dead. - Who?
bill's contact. I was supposed to meet him, and he never showed.
bill found him. The CIA guy.
he knows we're on to him.
Hey! We're on a schedule here. - One minute.
this is un-fuckin'-believable.
are you alone? - No, I'm with Bill.
good. Go back to the office and stay there until you hear from me.
and call Huntley. Tell him to bring security.
okay.
I'm so sorry.
Patty, you're not getting this time back.
I don't need it.
I'd like to talk to your client again, off the record.
I believe your last offer was $650 million?
Yes.
I'll accept a billion.
Jesus, Patty, come on.
as long as you can get me what I need.
and what is it you need?
you say resolving this case is important to your government.
Oui.
how important?
you know what I want to know.
you were there; you saw it.
this is your last chance.
Jesus Christ.
I brought some things from the States.
some beer.
peanuts.
I thought maybe you could use some things from home.
everything that's happened to you...
I've had my reasons, and they were good reasons.
I hope someday you'll be able to see that.
and,the other men...
Rayburn. - Yes.
they're gone, Chris.
they're not coming back. I can't bring 'em back, you can't bring 'em back.
they went in there.
they knew it was dangerous. No one forced them.
they needed the money.
we all did.
you see, that's why we worked for you, because...
you paid more than anyone else.
that's it.
my options with you...
are very limited, Chris.
now, the question that you and I have to answer together is...
what next?
you have a chance to save yourself...
but you need to summon your loyalty, you need to soldier up and maintain your silence, you need to take what happened on that last mission to your grave with you.
that's the code. I need you to honor that code.
fuck your code.
now, you listen to me, son... - Or what?
what are you gonna do? You gonna kill me?
go ahead, give me a fuckin' gun.
give me a fuckin' gun, I'll blow my fuckin' brains out right now for you.
go on, do it.
you tortured me because I told the truth?
whose truth?
because the truth that I see is there's people out there trying to kill us and we had the balls to go get them!
it was illegal. - The law is not the fucking truth!
now...
I'm giving you a chance to save yourself.
I was looking after you. I tried to protect you. I defended you.
that's what you did? You tried to help me?
Yeah. - Yeah?
Yeah. I told Boorman that you were a standup guy.
but what do you do? You betray me!
you talk to lawyers.
you send Nasim Marwat to fuck me!
everything that happened to you, you did to yourself.
fuck you.
you fucked yourself!
fuck you, you cocksucker!
fuck you!
go ahead and laugh.
because it's the last fucking thing you will ever do.
this agreement requires your client's company to change their testing practices.
if they don't comply, I'm coming after them again.
come on, Patty. You won. Relax.
you have something for me. - Yeah.
it's courtesy of the French Secret Services.
leave a message.
I know I shouldn't call, but I need to see you.
my government is betraying you.
classified
his name is Gerald Boorman.
and the French government gave you his file?
Yeah, they were very invested in the Tranzec case going away, so I made a deal.
you settled your case to help me with mine?
it was a very healthy settlement.
is there any useful information in here?
I found something very interesting.
the French Secret Service stopped getting intelligence briefings from Boorman in early 2010.
and Chris' last mission was October.
I think it's time we made a call.
Patty, it's Ellen. - I'm glad you called.
why is that?
I was just about to have a word with Mr. Boorman.
Hello, Mr. Boorman. This is Patty Hewes.
there's no need to respond.
I know you're listening. So please don't hang up.
I think we can be useful to each other.
I've learned a lot about you.
is that so?
let's start with the fact that you used to run an illegal extraction program called Operation Dust Devil.
with the help of High Star employees, your agency was able to provide the international community with intelligence about supposed terrorist activities in Afghanistan.
the problem is, the French government learned that much of your intelligence was faulty, and that some of the targets you tortured were innocent.
well, hell, they're the French.
so, because of international pressure, the CIA stopped Operation Dust Devil, which was, what, beginning of 2010.
but three employees of High Star were killed in October...
which means that you and Howard Erickson sent those men on a mission that was not sanctioned by the CIA.
what did you and Howard Erickson get out of that mission?
who was the target?
much as I'd love to chat about Dust Devil,
I'm afraid it's classified, and I'm just not at liberty.
you helped Erickson cover up the deaths of three High Star employees, so I'm thinking you've got a lot to lose.
we don't want you. We're not idiots.
we know we can't bring down the CIA.
well, who do you want?
proof that those men died illegally, so we can hold High Star accountable, get restitution for their families.
ms. Hewes...
you're wrestling with the wrong gator.
give us Howard Erickson, and we'll leave you alone.
I-I don't make deals.
mainly 'cause, I don't have to.
I know you had our contact killed.
and if anything happens to me or Miss Parsons,
I've arranged for everything we have on you to go public.
have a nice day, Mr. Boorman.
how'd it go? - As we suspected.
he didn't show his hand, and I could tell he was nervous.
what do we do next?
wait for him to turn against Erickson.
I was wrong.
the lawsuit against High Star?
you asked me if it had anything to do with Dust Devil.
does it?
Yes.
Erickson lied.
he went rogue on me.
after the agency called off the operation, he pulled another mission anyway.
so what's it got to do with us?
he used the Dust Devil unit, and three of 'em got killed.
Jesus. Fuck.
high Star's got to take the fall for this.
it's time we cut ties with Howard Erickson.
Hello?
Hello?
you talk to Sanchez?
Yes, I did, and I offered him a lifeline.
And?
the son of a bitch did not take it.
I'm sorry to hear that.
he forced my hand.
he's got to go.
you and I-- We go way back.
if that's your decision, I'm behind you 100%.
thank you, Jerry.
it's good to know I got you in the trenches with me.
Hello?
OK.
Dan in Real Life - ls this yours? - Dad.
didn't think so.
Hey, l was gonna do that for you later.
now you won't have to.
OK. OK, are you hungry? - Yeah.
cereal?
OK. - All right.
so the plan... - The plan.
Cara, Dad's about to reveal " the plan. "
l'll pack up the car, pick you up right after school, and then we'll drive straight...through.
sounds good.
does not. - What now?
well, isn't the whole point that we go to school?
you're forcing us to miss school when we should be, like, in school.
right? l mean, what about my studies?
OK, why are you smiling?
l just never thought l'd hear you say, " What about my studies? "
lt makes me, like, smile.
l don't wanna go.
we do this every year.
only time we can get the family together.
gotta help Grandma and Grandpa - Go.
you're destroying my education.
change.
yes?
very good column, sir. That bit about curfews? Very apt.
and may l also say that yesterday's column on boundary setting was excellent.
who are you?
l'm Marty Barasco. l would like to thank you for last Friday's column.
lt helped me understand my parents.
OK.
well, Marty, what else can l do for you?
l'd like to see your daughter, sir. lf l could.
actually, l'm here for Cara.
nice to meet you, Marty. Come back in two years.
l don't wanna brag, but Mr. Shaff says l'm one of the best drivers in his class.
he says l'm highway ready.
Mr. Shaff and l may not agree. Cara! Let's go.
so will you let me?
we'll see. 3pm sharp.
do not be... - Late. We got it.
late. - Yes, we do.
FYL, that boy you were really rude to before is my friend, Marty, my lab partner from class. We're doing an extra-credit project together.
bus.
wait! Wait, wait, wait! - Come on!
hurry up!
yeah?
Yeah, Jordy, l e-mailed it half an hour ago.
what?
no way. You're kidding.
that's funny.
Where's your sister?
you're late.
she went to Yumms.
can l drive?
dad's going to be syndicated.
not so fast. There're others being considered...
Aw, that's great. Can l drive?
look. You're a fine driver.
lt's the just the other hundred million dr... - lf you don't let me, l'll never learn.
but if l let you, you may not live.
what was that? What are you doing?
could you be more embarrassing? - Sorry to interrupt your studies.
well, we can't all be monks like you. No.
by the way, you're grounded.
Oh, l'm grounded? - Yep - For how long? - For life.
dad, come on. lt's humiliating.
tell me about it.
grounded for a month.
a month! But that's worse than forever.
OK, Dad, why?
you lied to me.
Yeah, well, you can't handle the truth.
try me next time.
But...but... - No, no. No. No.
OK, Dad. l...l love Marty.
Oh, please.
come on.
dad, Dad. Dad, Dad, stop. OK, just listen. Listen.
l didn't know right away. lt took me a while.
what's a while?
l've known him for three weeks, but l knew in three days.
you can't know in three days.
well, maybe she can. - No, no. No.
what you're feeling is not love.
lt is young and reckless. - Yes, it is. l love him.
you may think it's love, it is not! - No, l love him.
l love him.
no, it's not. No, it's not. - l love him. l love him. l love him.
dad? You OK?
there goes Jane's college education.
there goes Cara's.
Oh, no. What about mine?
no, you're good.
Ah, no, wait. There it goes.
you can't keep me from Marty.
dad, let me remind you that guys are half the world, and l'll find others.
but know that only Marty gets my heart. - ln the car.
l know a really good driver.
no. No.
here you go.
l think your sisters aren't very happy with me.
Duh. - Why do you think?
you're a good father, but sometimes a bad dad.
who told you to say that?
no one.
was it Jane or Cara? You can tell me.
l made it up myself. - No. You didn't.
which one of your sisters told you to say that?
l made it up myself. l'm in the fourth grade.
l can make things up for myself. - Jane or Cara?
l made it up myself. - Jane or Cara?
l'm in the fourth grade. - She's in the fourth grade!
Oh, they're here.
they're here. Come, girls.
Hey, Poppy. - Good to see you.
Hi, Lil.
Hey, Dad.
well, now we're all here. How you doing?
uh, fine. Or maybe not.
my kids can't stand me.
means you're doing something right.
Oh, you're so... - Hiya, honey.
look at your girls. They're all grown up.
no, no, no. They're still very young. - Come on, Lilly. Lilly.
Hey, how are you?
she's getting big. - Getting bigger every day.
Hey, man.
hello. - Hello.
Hey, Eileen, how are you?
did you hit traffic?
Yeah, it wasn't... eh, not too bad.
Hi, sis.
glad you're here. - Good to see you. Who are they?
l've never seen these guys in my life.
Hi, Uncle Dan. - Say something.
something. - lt happened. l knew it.
way to go.
sounds good. - Help your uncle with his bags, OK?
honey, you're down here.
your brother, Mitch, has a friend coming to visit, so...
l'm in the special room. - Yeah.
sorry, bro. - That's OK.
you sleep tight. - You too.
you tired? - Get down, get down!
morning.
good morning.
sleep OK? - Yeah.
can l get you guys something?
get a life.
she just needs some space.
that's not what she needs. - Yeah. She does.
from the sound of things, you all do.
Yeah, why don't you go get the papers?
Oh, Mom.
Yeah, go on.
lt would do you good.
get lost for a little while.
maybe l should stick around. - No.
get lost, Danny.
lt's not a request.
good morning.
l'll be with you in a minute.
well, then he went downtown.
Yeah. For coffee. Right.
talks to him on weekends.
excuse me. Could you help?
Yes.
l'm looking for a book, obviously.
anything in particular?
Yeah, something that can help me deal with, um...
what might be an awkward situation.
OK. Um, what...
what's kind of, um... - Well, something funny might be nice.
but not necessarily big, " ha ha ha, " laugh-out-loud funny, you know, and certainly not make-fun-of-other-people funny, but rather something, - uh, human funny. - OK.
and, uh, if it could, um, sneak up on you, surprise you, and at the same time make you think that what you thought was not only right in a wrong kind of way, but when you're wrong, there's a certain rightness to your wrongness.
well, maybe what l mean is, um, more importantly, l'm looking to be swept up.
and at the same time, not.
meaning l wanna feel, uh, a deep connection to, uh, something.
or maybe l don't know what l'm looking for.
well, in my experience, you rarely find it all in just one book.
maybe that's why there're so many.
so, what do we have?
we have a smattering, a sort of potpourri ... - Potpourri?
of possibilities. Yeah.
um, here we go. We have, uh, poetry.
dickinson, you know, basic stuff.
little Neruda is always good. - l agree.
Oh, now, this is actually a real page-turner.
the Life of Gandhi?
l... No, but he...
nobody has ever been quite so cool as him.
um, lighthouses.
a Good Man Is Hard to Find.
uh, the title alone.
Anna Karenina. l don't...
Oh, now, that's funny.
no, actually, no, funny is here.
maybe it's not that funny.
no, actually that's funny. Very funny, and true.
good. OK, good.
but, uh, if you could pick only one.
well, l would say that nothing rivals the romance of Fishcliff.
l'm being honest.
l just walked around and l just grabbed stuff.
l just grabbed whatever l could grab. - You were lookin' for?
sold. - l'm sorry?
l want them all.
these were just suggestions, l...
make sure he gets the commission for this.
he doesn't work here.
well, he should.
you are smooth.
uh, actually, no, l'm not smooth.
l'm, uh, Dan.
sorry.
um, so, Marie, can l make it up to you?
OK. Here is your tea.
hot. Watch it. And there is my orange juice.
and l bought a muffin, but l think they gave me a small planet.
l should put that down.
thank you. - l have napkins and utensils.
l'm a big believer in forks.
and you are not, apparently.
so, Dan... - Yes.
you were born?
l was born. Like everybody else.
and l grew up, like everybody else.
good?
um, OK. What else?
l went to school, and l had a Bonanza lunch pail.
this show,'60s, a TV show.
when l was ten, l wanted to be a magician.
so l used to hold these magic shows for all the kids in the neighborhood.
l tried to make a neighborhood girl levitate.
and she didn't.
and it involved a body cast, and several stitches...
the end of my...
let me tell you something, something l've never...
you're gonna laugh.
something l've never told anybody in my life.
um, and this is really hard for me to say.
and then she got, uh, sick.
and, um, then she was gone.
and, uh...
lt's taken a while.
we should probably talk about something else.
so you're telling me that you're one of those widowers with three daughters who preys on unsuspecting women in bookstores?
lt seems that would be me.
been there. - Really?
no, it seems that it's been...
seriously hard. - No.
no, we're OK now. We're really OK.
you don't have to smile.
better than the alternative.
can you hold?
excuse me.
no, no, l'm minutes away.
Yes.
um, l have to go. - OK.
l just lost track of time.
l wish we could keep talking.
well, it was nice, and a bit unusual, meeting you.
maybe l can call you sometime?
uh, that might be awkward.
cause you're in a relationship?
Yes. A new one.
l would've found out if l hadn't been talking. - That's true.
but it's not exactly fair, is it?
l mean, you know all about me...and l know nothing about you.
l don't wanna go through the rest of my life wondering about the woman in the bookstore who let me do the talking.
all we'd be is two people finishing a conversation.
OK. No harm in that.
Oh, OK.
call.
or don't, but, uh, call.
just so you know, um, l would even call to say l'm not calling.
OK.
'l'd even call to say l'm not calling? "
sorry. Sorry!
l, um...
l never do this kind of thing, officer.
l'm usually very careful.
and nobody believes in...
welcome to Rhode lsland. - Yeah, OK.
Yeah, it's nice to be here.
what's wrong?
nobody. l mean, nothing.
Danny's back.
dude, are you all right?
what? Yeah. No, no, no, l'm good.
Really? Yeah.
cause you don't... you don't seem good.
well, it was the strangest thing.
l, um...
wow
wow what?
l met somebody, and she's really something.
hot - Bro, that is beyond huge!
you got her number? - Yeah.
you gonna call?
lt's complicated.
no, it's simple. You've gotta call.
no, he just met her.
he's probably worried it's too soon.
no, it's never too soon. Especially for somebody his age.
Amy, Dan met someone.
he met someone? - Dan met someone?
come here. How soon till he can call?
l don't know. l haven't been single for years.
me neither.
my God, who is she? - Uncle Dan met someone?
Dan met a hottie. - All right, all right. That is enough.
you know what? Let's ask Annie.
just now? - Now.
what does she look like?
she...
what's the, um...
the question?
this is my brother, Dan.
and, um, he needs your advice.
he met some hottie downtown, and, um...
she's a little shell-shocked. - Wouldn't you be?
Mitch neglects to mention that in their weekend away, she's gonna meet our entire family.
l didn't want to scare her off.
let's go, everybody!
let's go. - Congratulations.
so, um, Annie?
lt's Anne-Marie.
um, Mitch calls me Annie, but, uh, l'm Marie everywhere else.
l've two Marys and a Martha in my exercise class, so l didn't wanna confuse people.
no. That would be not good.
l... l prefer Marie.
come on, sweetie. Women are on the porch.
girls out there, guys in here.
come on, Dan. Let's do it.
perfect! OK.
the briefest time units. Four letters.
mili. - Oh, wait.
great!
Hey, no spying.
you guys are way behind!
that's not helping.
uh, l don't think " secretive " fits.
no, it doesn't fit. " Secretive " doesn't fit.
let's move on to 1 2 across. - We're movin' on.
for you to be interested in someone, she must be really special, right?
skip 1 2.
this is what l'm trying to tell you.
lt is not going to happen.
she is already dating somebody.
that's not your problem, bro.
actually, it kind of is.
listen up, 1 5 across, five letters, pan-fry.
pan-fry. - Pan-fry.
dude, is there a rock on her left hand?
uh, no, not yet.
then all's fair.
all right, now focus, people! Pan-fry!
Sauté.
Oh, my gosh. Of course it's sauté!
and, uh, the word before, did we try " zeitgeist " ?
lt would be E-l-T.
l think it would make " ozone " work.
Lord, we hit the mother lode!
ten letters.
'anything that can go wrong, will. " So...
earth to Dan. We're still at across.
we're not even at down, Dan.
we're dying here, buddy.
we're done.
Hooray for the dishes. - Congratulations, yeah.
let's check it! - What now, boys?
dishes, duh!
what happened? You were useless out there.
sorry, guys.
lay off him. He's got a lot on his mind.
dad, Mom. What do you think of...
well, Mitch, it's too soon to tell.
that being said, she's bright, lovely, adorable, and if you botch this up, we'll keep her and get rid of you.
Dan, honey, you missed a spot.
seriously, dude. That girl is smokin'. Amazing. Really.
what do you think of her?
um, she's great.
no, no! Let's go, Gus. - All right.
can l show you where we are on this map...
Oh, yes. Yes. - here?
um, if l had known, l would have never...
not my brother's girlfriend.

Dan does have a point. - Right?

Mitch, what're you doing?
Marie brought some books, but l thought she should read a real book by a real writer.
Oh, no, no, no. Not a good idea.
au contraire. - Please don't.
best book l've read.

when l was four. - Yeah, but...OK.
stick with me, guys. Oh, l have an idea! Bowling!
sounds good.
life is full of disappointment.
big and sometimes even bigger.
so, what's it gonna be?
the lighthouse or the whaling museum? Your pick.
do you know why we have lighthouses?
because they're neat?
that's right. Yes.
and also because they help when it's dark out.
they, uh, help keep boats safe and keep us from crashing into the rocks.
because when you're out there and you're being tossed back and forth by those big dark waves and you think that you'll never feel land again and that you could just split into a million pieces and sink down all the way down...
deep, it's the light that keeps us on course.
lt's the light...
dad, are you OK?
course l'm OK... honey.
did you guys have fun?
no. - No.
jump inside. Let's go, honey.
kids? Where've you been?

Hi, buddy.

l was fast. Wasn't l?
Yeah, it was like l couldn't catch up.
even your sweat is beautiful.
Where'd Dan go?
mom, she moves like a goddess out there. - Yeah?
she's like a panther. You know, just her body...
she's competitive, but l just wanted to pounce. You know what l mean?
l wanted to ride her up the beach. She was... - Don't do that.
she was like my stallion.
l wanted her to be in front of me. You know what l mean?
there's fresh towels up there in the cabinet to the right.
l miss your skin.
l miss your smell.
l miss... l miss your eyes.
dad!
l...
you're such a freak! - l...
no, sorry. That was just my loser of a father!
Yeah, he was totally spying.

a nice time?
Yes, l am. - Really? So you're enjoying yourself?
except for the soap in my eyes. - OK.
cause you know what? l'm not.
l'm not enjoying myself, and l think that, as two people of principle, we should have ground rules. Don't you?
Oh, yeah, sure. OK, sure.
OK! All right, that's...That's what l'm talking about.
no, no, no. We need to keep our distance.
stop. Stay away.
towel. - Stop.
OK. l'm sorry.
thank you.
and, you know, stop reading my book. OK, just stop.
Why?
and that salsa thing you do...
what are you talking about? - The salsa dance.
this... This thing.
lf you could just not do that.
l'm sorry. - lf you stop doing that as a rule, it would be very helpful to me.
there are other things you can do, such as not exist.
thank you. That...
not... Yeah! l said it. l said it.
l didn't mean it, but l said it.
and you know what else l'm gonna do? - What?
l am going to make myself less attractive, so as to not encourage any inappropriate feelings.
OK, that's hilarious. But you know what?
l... No.
l'm gonna stop thinking about you.
good. - l will.
and if l start thinking about you, which may happen in a moment of...
weakness. - weakness, l'm going to focus all of my thoughts on your flaws.
my flaws. - Your flaws.
and they are?
l have no idea, but you can rest assured that l am going to find...
just ask Nana.
l'm so sorry. Are you taking a shower?
Yes. l'm taking a shower.
Oh, well, a little advice. Old houses, old pipes.
thank you. Takes forever to heat up. Thanks.
um, can l talk to you about something?
sure. Absolutely.
and can we just keep it between us?
lt's just... lt was...
see, last night what l was... You were talking about your life last night.
the importance of travel and of, um, trying new things, you know, and l just started thinking about...Amazing!
all of that, you know, how much... That looks like it's ready.
right.
but just... Oh, you're...You're still dressed.
Oh, l forgot.
l'll look away. l'll look over here.
anyway, so, l just realized, you know, really, um...
you know, l've been thinking a lot about what l wanna do, um, you know, in the future, like not just for school, but...
lt's just hard to figure out exactly what l wanna do with my life.
l mean, l know l wanna go somewhere new and, you know, try new things, um...
l mean it's just hard to figure out, you know, your place, like where you should be.
right.
and just to have that experience, you know, and to...
which is, you know, what it's all about. You know?
right.
but it's also, l mean, it's also...
l mean, it's also terrifying realizing what you want is what you want.
you know what l mean?
you know, l think it's so interesting not...
Lnteresting the way that, um, you end up somewhere other than where you, um...
lunch!
mac and cheese. Nothing better.
adults are in the dining room.
you know, l think l'm going to mix it up and sit with my peeps.
Dan. Honey...

I'm not talking about Romeo.
you're so funny.
delighted that he was fat. Delighted that he was old.
no doubt in the world about that. Delighted that he had gold.

scene. An actor prepares. Acting, people, is action and reaction.
Oh shit! - Yes, son, yes. Yes, that's truth!
you don't know me. - I see murder in your eyes.
Yes, that's good, son.
you need an agent. You are excellent.

no? You, get out of my class, get out of my class.
you call yourself an actor? Get out!
damn it, I gave up my manhood.
twice.

refund, please!
that Dane Cook makes me do this.
well, I kind of like that movie I thought she did a really good job.

Yeah, I guess I'd rather see her act than ruin the Cowboys chances of ever winning the Super Bowl
it seems as though we have a debate going on here
how about those mom jeans?

I definitely don't know how Star Jones didn't know her husband was gay.

well, I had a great time tonight. - I'm glad you liked the club.
I'll see you tomorrow. - You got a ride?
no, I m just gonna walk home.
no, no, no, no. There's too many wannabe thugs around here.
Yeah. I'll walk you. - No, it's fine. I can protect myself.
I was actually hoping you could protect me.
you're serious. - Yeah, I'm serious.
well, what are you gonna do?

I had a really great time tonight. - Yeah, me too.
if you ever wanna like, hook up sometime and work on your dance moves, I'm totally, like, up for it.
well, yeah, that'd be great. - We, I'll see you tomorrow then.
alright. Thanks for the dance. - No problem.
you have to teach me that one.
okay. - Okay.
see you. - Bye.
my house is that way.
wow...
are you gonna do your show tomorrow?
don't have any more alcohol. Don't you see what it's doing to you?
it's ruining your life. You're on the floor with no shirt and tight pants
promise me, you're not gonna have any more alcohol!
promise me you're not gonna have any more alcohol!
I promise
don't have any more alcohol or else I'm gonna disown you. Say you promise.
I don't have anyone.
what? What do you mean? Of course you have me!
I don't have a little black boy.
that's true but that doesn't mean you don't have me. So say you promise.
I promise...
alright. Let's warm up
okay, let's do this.
okay - Yeah, now you're getting it.
see, hip hop is aggressive.
it's raw, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna invade your space and then you invade mine back.
it's like a battle. Alright? - Okay. Okay. Okay.
all right. So I'm gonna guide you.
okay. - Okay.
your space my space, Your space my space. How's that feel?
good. Good. - Good? All right.
cause I'm gonna let go of the training wheels now so.
Really? - Yeah, get ready.
okay. - You got it. Feel it.
it's aggressive. You gotta be aggressive towards me
okay.
bitch, what's wrong with you? You just gonna invade my space?
don't invade my space!
you're gonna invade my Knees!
good.
now what you gotta do is learn how to back your shit up.
you wanna try it again? - No, no, no.
alright. - I'm good.
very good. Very good.
so, that's it for today. Tomorrow I'm gonna teach you how to do this.
okay.
so tell me what's up with you and A-Con?
I don't get why you guys hang out. You're so different.
look, me and him got into some stuff a while ago. He got caught, I didn't.
but he never ratted me out, so I owe him for that
but don't you wanna be something more than just a street thug?
I know you've got bigger dreams than that. What do you wanna be?
I wanna be a doctor.
I bet you wanna work with kids, don't you?
no, vaginas. - What?
I wanna be a vaginacologist. They're all I think about.
big ones, small ones, the cute ones with the little Hitler mustaches on them.
or how about the ones that are fat like Jay-Z's lips?
but I gotta get into college first so... But what about you?
what does your mom think about you dancing hip-hop?
my mom's dead.
well, how come you never talk about her?
what am I supposed to do? Run around the school yelling about it?
if it helps.
my mom's dead! She's dead! My mom's dead!
this book is so good.
you like Thomas, don't you? - No.
well, he's okay, I guess.
he does have a nice smile, beautiful skin, and luscious lips.
but I love his big fat...
Hey, hey, hey, girl. That's my brother.
what? I was just gonna say butt.
well, you should see his di...
girl, I wonder who that could be.
I hate when people come by unannounced, so tacky.
what do you want?
you know what I want, Charity, I'm here to pick up my son.
Hey, son.
alright, I'm out.
I'll be back next week to pick him up again.
he's such a good father!
Yes, I got in!
what is it? What's happened?
Dr. Thomas Anderson. - Let me see. Hold on.
you and everyone else that applied have been accepted "to Just Community College."
just Community College?
just Community College! That's great you got in!
Congratulations!
that's great!
Megan, tonight I'm taking you out to celebrate.
don't look. - Okay.
stairs there's stairs. - Where?
right now. - Okay.
I'm so excited. - I'm glad.
are you looking? - No, I m not looking.
all right. Are you ready? - Yes.
surprise!
I'm sorry I can't go in there.
what do you mean you can't go in there?
this is where I'm taking you. - No.
come on. It's opening night. You're going.
# She risked her life. #
# What a sacrifice. #
# Smashed by a truck Last words were, "What the fuck?" #
# Momma's gone, momma's gone. #
# No more can you see her face. #
# Or hear her voice on the phone. #
# Your momma's dead, momma's dead And she's never coming back. #
# Your momma's dead, momma's dead. That's right, she's never coming back. #
# You can wish. #
# She's never coming back. #
# You can cry. #
# She's never, she's never coming back. #
# Now go kill yourself. #
# That's right, she's never coming back. #
# Mom! #
encore! Encore!
I thought you would've liked it. - I did.
you wasn't acting like you did.
wasn't even being loud. I didn't hear you heckle once.
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Thomas, but dancing isn't a part of my life anymore.
why not? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent?
how do you know I have talent? Cause I danced at the club?
because I saw the look on your face when you did it, Megan.
it's the same look you had tonight.
it's the same exact look that you had.
it's the same Mother.
guys, can you quiet down here please? Can I talk to the girl?
low self-esteem? Vulnerable?
thank you.
like I was saying. - Yeah.
I saw the look on your face when you did it.
it's the same look you had tonight. Goofy, happy, pale with freckles.
so if you're gonna tell me something about not dancing, then tell me something real.
maybe I don't want it to be real.
what I want is to wake up and see my mom.
for things to go back to the way they were when life made sense.
and it's all my fault she got scraped off the highway for me.
for my damn audition.
she was rushing, it was raining. - Wait, it was raining?
well, yeah, but she promised she would be there.
I made her promise.
Damn! So, it was raining and you still made her promise?
yeah and then I didn't wait for her. - That's messed up!
so, even if she didn't die she still would've been late?
I know I should've waited for her, but they called my name and...
and then I didn't say anything.
so she would've got there and been stuck outside.
that's what you're saying?
well, technically, yeah, but they called me.
you didn't put your mother's name on the list? Are you kidding me?
well, I had to go over my dance moves, so I didn't have time to.
you didn't have time for your own mother?
the person who gave birth to you. You didn't have time for her?
no. I. No. I. - Okay
no, I see what kind of party this is.
cry me a river.
all she wanted was for me to dance.
no. All she wanted was to live
not that she didn't support your dream.
it's just, the point is you killed your mother.
and she's never coming back. She's dead because of you.
God hates you, okay?
so, you not dancing doesn't make any damn sense at all.
I know! But she...
I just don't think I could do it without her.
do you want this?
I mean do you really wanna go to Juilliard?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
well then, it's on you to make your dream come true.
Oh, shit, black girls.
so what you're gonna wanna do is make that left go up three blocks.
I don't know you and... - What are you?
Thomas, what are you talking about? - Sisters! Yeah.
so this is where you live? - Yep, this is it.
Oh my God!
this is my dad's music room.
he's actually pretty good, if you like the buckets.
I don't.
he's working tonight, so he's gonna be gone all night.
so that means we could probably play the TV as loud as we want. Yeah!
there's a Blue's Clues marathon! It's not working.
well, I was thinking more like...
make hotdogs?
not exactly. Okay. More like...
ice cream. Who has two thumbs and wants ice cream? This guy.
no.
charades. I like charades - All right I'm good at this. - Yes!
yoga. You're doing yoga.
leap frog. Okay. You riding a pony. - Yeah, yeah, yes, yeah.
no, Thomas! Have sex!
why didn't you say something?
well, I'm a little shy.
yo. Sugar Bear wants to see you.
who's that scary-looking guy?
who, him? That's nobody.
just an old friend, you know. - Oh, okay.
we should all get together sometime. - Yeah, great.
I'm just gonna go hang out. Do some cardio. Read.
well, have fun. - I will really.
Hey, yo Thomas, they caught us fam. I don't know how they found you though.
I gotta go. - Okay
so I'm gonna give you a call around 9: 11?
that's a little late, but that's okay.
and I also got us some Police concert tickets
Oh, my God, I love the Police! I'm so excited
there's a COPS marathon. COPS. Love it right?
okay. I'll TV it - Okay. Bye.
Bye!
you ain't got my dough yet?
you know how much bread, how much cheddar, how much cake that is?
I want my chips.
don't worry man, we gonna have your money for you, Sugar.
when? - Soon as possible, fam
well, that ain't good enough.
there's a dance battle coming up, and I suggest you win.
what if we lose? - No!
No! No!
# And I am telling you. #
# My belly's growling. #
# I like glazed ham, pig feet and toes. #
# The Biggest Loser, I say no. #
# Give me Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo steaks. #
# Chicken and ribs, too. #
# I'm not living without food. #
# I don't wanna be no Nicole Richie. #
# Chips by the mountain. Soda pop from the spout. #
# You can say what you wanna. I'm not working out. #
# Fry me some chicken, strike up the grill. #
# 'Cause you're gonna feed me. #
# That's right, you will yes. #
# I am smelling food. #
# I'm so hungry. #
# Smucker's is the best jam I've ever known. #
# And you, and you and you. #
# You're gonna feed me. #
# Feed me. #
# Feed me. #
# Feed me. #
# Feed... #
# Me. #
be aggressive, guys. Let's score!
excuse me! Come on, let's get that basket!
why do they call you nappy? I don't understand it.
why don't you "D" up on her?
you know maybe if you weren't so tired from having sex with Thomas, maybe you could guard her.
how do you know I had sex with Thomas?
who's the ho now?
give that back! - No!
you are going down, Twiggy!
you bow-legged bitch!
break it up! Break it up! Get off of her!
what are you doing?
I am not gonna have two nubile, sweaty teens fighting like that making me moist in my own gym! Do you understand?
if you've got a beef to settle, we're gonna settle in my way. Got it?
Oh yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
get her! - Come on! Get that ass!
grab it! - You want some of this?
I'm gonna make it rain on these hoes! Yeah!
show me what you got! Let me see some ass!
what's wrong with you guys?
do you know what's at stake here? We're talking state championships!
Hey! Stand up, Weiner!
you're not looking polished, Knob!
you gotta play hard, Cockran!
Headd! You gotta give me some!
don't you guys wanna know what it feels like to be winners?
to be 10 men holding each other after a big victory?
standing naked in the showers, screaming at the top of your lungs, foam flying?
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Now, that is the spirit, son!
now the rest of you get your head in the game!
let's go!
so how did he catch it?
probably one of them kids at school. You know kids.
I told him to wear a condom but does he listen to me? No.
just like his damn daddy.
now you sit there and let it itch.
so I heard about the fight.
Yeah! It was all Nora's fault.
it was all Nora's fault? You didn't have anything to do with it?
no, she's just jealous of me and Thomas.
well, what do you expect? It is hard out there for a white girl.
it used to be that y'all just show up and bat your eyes, and the brothers would come running.
but now, the competition is fierce.
you see, girl first it was Jennifer Lopez with puffy.
she opened the door for every Latina this side of the border.
then it was Kimora Lee Simmons leading a dojo of Asian bitches.
and now we got Kim Kardashian, and her big, Armenian ass pulling brothers right and left.
so what is a rich white girl supposed to do?
the last thing she needs is you coming in here with your blonde hair, your perky breasts and a little bit of rhythm, taking the last sell out brother left.
you think that Nora is the only oppressed white girl?
well, I'II have you know, I have paid my dues.
excuse me, miss? Have you been drinking?
Nope - Ma'am, step out of the car.
the damage isn't that bad.
ma'am, I'm gonna have to have you blow to this tube.
ma'am, I meant this tube.
it's a lot bigger.
ma'am, I m gonna have to take you in.
time's up, Miss White.
you're free to go. Hope you earned your lesson.
what take you so long?
your flashback was longer than your timing counting, and that don't make you one of us.
I thought we were friends.
what do you mean we're not gonna pay Sugar Bear back his money?
cause I'm tired of Sugar Bear's ways of trying to punk us, B.
what type of self-respecting thug pays back a debt?
so what are you gonna do when he comes after us?
he ain't coming after us. We gonna get him first.
meet me under the bridge tonight, 8: 00. - No.
bitch. - Okay.
there's something I need to tell you.
you're pregnant? Oh, no.
what? No, Thomas, I'm not pregnant.
good, 'cause with your big head and my ears. God only knows.
no, I'm performing at the senior showcase, and then, who knows maybe Juilliard.
that's great!
and I was kind of thinking, you know, maybe we should just kind of cool it for a while.
what do you mean?
I'm saying I think we need to take a break.
break, definitely yeah, we should definitely take a break.
how long you need like, 30, 40 minutes?
we actually should synchronize our watches, - so we can meet up. - No, Thomas, I need space.
okay. Space, Space is good. That's enough space?
Thomas, we're done.
definitely. This has been a long rehearsal, very tough.
Thomas, I'm leaving you!
I don't wanna be your girlfriend anymore!
we spend more time defending our relationship.
than actually having one!
nobody wants to see us together. Not my friends and not yours.
I'm saying it's over.
fine.
fine, leave. Get out! - Sorry! I'm sorry!
God has put you in my path and aim to keep you!
I'm making steaks for dinner and I expect you to stay.
so here's my number. You just call me. Oh, You married?
that's sexy. I'll talk to you later.
Oh shit!
hey - Hey
can we talk?
can we talk, Charity?
I just want to let you know from now on, things are gonna be different.
I don't want to be kind of father that his kid only sees him on the weekends.
that's not the kind of life I want for my son. My son!
you don't even know his name. - It doesn't matter!
Maury said it was a 99. 9% chance that he is mine!
and I'm gonna honor that!
anyway, I want my kid to wake up every morning and see my face.
here, put this in his room.
I'm out.
Hey, sup man, I gotta talk to you.
I ain't going with you - What you mean you not going with me?
I mean this shit is dangerous!
of course it's dangerous, it's a drive-by!
but we can get the money.
all we have to do is battle the 409 at the Streets tonight, pay Sugar Bear back, and we're good.
nigger, did you wear a pink shirt to a drive-by?
it brings out my eyes.
look, if you walk away from this, I'II walk away with you.
walk away from what? I'm not you, Thomas
I can't go to Just Community like you, be a doctor, operating on people and shit.
Yes, you can, man! If I can do it, you can do it!
not with these arms!
I got guns for hands!
they call me Edward Trigger hands, fam.
for me, it's all about respect.
are you wearing the elastic I asked you to wear?
keep your chins up.
you're never gonna be a Nora. Have a good show.
Yes, this is she.
Hey, Charity. Where's Thomas?
the last time I heard, he and A-Con went after Sugar Bear.
what? - Yeah, they owe him $5, 000.
and they can't come up with the money.
there has to be another way.
well, if he had a crew he could've battled at the Streets.
and possibly won the money back, but where we gonna find a crew?
Hey, guys! Thomas is in trouble and he needs our helps.
there's a battle at the Streets tonight and he needs a crew.
so, what are you saying? You want to start a crew?
Yeah!
and who's gonna be in this "crew"?
well, maybe you don't wanna step out of your perfect world, but there's a lot going on under the radar at Musical High.
take sweet little Tracy for example.
she has really bad hair.
Tyler has a horrible smile!
and what about you, Nora?
I mean, everybody knows that you're the best dancer in school.
let's do this!
what about the showcase?
the 409 Crew coming up, y'all! 409 yeah!
it's that time y'all
now I believe that our distinguished panel of random extras have made their decision
may I have the envelope please?
man.
and for all you people at home watching,
I am wearing all yellow.
this is a tight moment. Tighter than the button on my suit.
ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!
the winner is... - Hey, yo, Truck!
what do you want, punk? - Hey, hey. Hey, now.
I wanna battle. Me and you, one on one
that's not how it goes. You have to have a crew to battle.
says who? - It's a written law of the Streets.
says it right there. "No dance battling without a crew."
and you don't have a crew. - Oh, yes, he does.
Megan? What are you doing here?
Oh no, this for street dancers only. They're not street dancers.
we gonna do it just like we do it on the Streets.
now the baddest man hit my hand.
now you've been challenged. Do you accept?
let's do this. - All right!
then it's gonna be the 409 Crew versus, what's your name, young man?
show your love!
let's go, 409, let's go!
uncle Toms, assemble!
we got this.
Hey, wait a minute. I thought only the good guys get to go in slow motion?
Hey, yo, Thomas. - A-Con!
what's up? Wait, what happened with Sugar Bear?
Mr. Stache took care of that, man. We good.
now let's serve these suckers, B.
everybody huddle up.
hold on, man!
yo how we gonna compete with these guys with these guys?
we got this, A-Con.
all right everybody. You just do what you do best, okay?
let's do this!
what's going on? - I don't think I can do this.
remember the routine you used to do at the club?
do that and you'll be great.
okay
I didn't mean that club.
that's my girl!
what's this?
Yeah!
nigger. Did you wear tight ass shorts and skates to a battle?
Yeah! So did you.
Oh yeah. And you worked for TI in ATL, right?
what's up, dawg!
wee!
stop weeing!
Yeah! what!
Yeah!
they did their thing tonight!
and the judges have made their decision.
and the winner is - A tie? - What?
Oh, hell, no! Y'all can't do this to these kids!
what y'all want to see? Y'all want to see them battle it out?
all right. We gonna do this the Stache way.
each crew gets one move, no rules, and the audience will decide.
let's get it on!
let's go. They got one move left, and we know what that is.
three, four, five, six, seven.
what are they doing? - Stealing our move man!
I'm not stealing yours, shit!
now what?
yo, that's not fair. You stole our move!
that's true. But you still got one move left.
I came here to get my bread, my chips, my cheese.
here you go. - I'm talking about my money, bitch.
don't get cute.
all right, fat boy, let's see what you got.
I'm about to get in your ass!
am I still cute? I look like a black Gumby?
and the crowd has spoken!
the winner of this year's Battle of the Streets and $5, 000
goes to the Uncle Toms!
Yeah! Show your love!
now that's a battle right there! That's what I'm talking about!
good work, guys! - Hey
Hey!
that was really wild what you did out there.
Thanks. I couldn't let you go out there and risk your future.
Oh, my gosh, Megan, Megan, congratulations, girl!
Thanks, Charity.
by the way, I brought somebody with me.
well now, that certainly was different. - I guess it was.
so you and your entire crew missed the senior showcase for this?
ever since I started hanging out with these guys, I've earned a lesson.
some things are more important than going to college or getting a high-paying job or inventing something that could save the lives of millions.
it's something we like to call respect.
and you only get it here, in the Streets.
Yeah!
well, this might surprise you, but I know a little something about the hip-hop.
what you know about hip-hop?
well, back in the day I happened to be one of the best beatboxers around.
is that right? - Yeah.
why don't you kick a beat then? - All right
that beat is hot. But her lips ain't moving.
Oh, yes, they are - Yo!
# We like to party #
# We don't cause trouble. We don't bother nobody #
# We're just some men that's on the mic #
# And when we rock upon the mic. We rock the mic right #
# I am a human beatbox #
hold onto me.
what's the matter, Thomas?
you think you know me? - Yes.
then you need to see me in the light.
are you afraid?
no. I'm not afraid.
you should be.
aren't you even a little scared? - No. More disappointed than anything.
you just turned around with glitter on your face.
you don't even have fangs. - Let's dance.
now you're dancing - At prom. And next year, at Juilliard
Thomas, why didn't you take me when you had the chance?
you don't know what you're saying. You don't really want this.
it will change your life. Besides, you know what they say.
once you go black, you never go back?
no. You shouldn't do it until you're with the one you'll be with forever.
I dream of being with you forever.
so you really want this? - Yes Give it to me right now.
you're gonna have a long and happy life with me.
Oh shit, white guys.
so what you're gonna do is leave the car up front.
here are the keys. It's the one blasting Coldplay.
don't steal anything, okay? Scurry on.
not too bad at all.
Yes.
this is pretty easy, actually.
look at their figures, nothing stunning
I think you look better.
Thanks.
I'm sure you dance better than them.

but pretty well is not enough!
lift up your standard please.
and you treat yourself better please.
when I was young; whenever you smiled I would be delighted.
you know what?
since I'm back, this is the first time I see you smile.

I just want you to be happy, sis.

Hello?
I'm jimmy Cheung.
my sister is on her way to your studio.
I don't care how you do it.
you have to make her stay and learn dancing.
kiddy, what're you talking about?
don't play phone tags.
my sister is Tina Cheung, the CEO of the Galaxy Group of hotels.
whatever!
check out your door, if you don't trust me.
Hello?
I'm his agent, talk to me.
if you can make my sister happy,
I can make you guys very happy as well.
what do you mean by happy?
give me your account number.
ma'am, wanna learn dancing?
what's your name?
we just met yesterday.
really, sorry... please come in.
boys and girls, take a break.
I'm Tina Cheung.
I've a Christmas ball by the end of the year.
I want Host, the best kind.
I want you to be my partner.
how much for a session?
3000
Mr. Lau, we've checked all studios' prices before knocking on your door.
once a champion only charges $3, 500.
my boss doesn't like to bargain.
but she doesn't like hypocrites either.
ma'am!
I don't give a shit about money. I'm an artist.
if you live up to my expectation, I'll still teach you for free.
wanna try?
give me your hand.
look at me.
good.
follow my footstep.
turn around.
good.
you never learn dancing?
never.
really looks good.
if you have never learned dancing, unless you're a born dancer...
surrendered.
don't waste my time... how much?
whatever you say.
reasonable, deal!
see you tomorrow.
Kam.
sorry, wait up.
I've given some thoughts to it.
I wanna change the direction.
I wanna group all talented students together.
in a group lesson instead.
I thought group lessons would harm my talent.
talented students together will bring positive affects to each other.
do you understand?
it's only $400 after all.
I understand!
then see you tomorrow.
good.
Mr. Lau.
just now...
this step... when can I do it?
very soon, tomorrow.
that soon?
the instructor doesn't sound good to me.
do you wanna change another?
Mr. Lau, the money has already transferred to your account.
why do you wanna see me still?
we decided not to teach your sister.
Why?
your sister is lack of talent. And her figure is bad.
her temper...
well, that's why we plan not to take her.
you can't ditch me now.
we won't cheat your money though.
we'll give you back the money.
this kid only wants his sister to be happy what do you think?
sure.
sure...
a bit more, a bit more will do.
alright, no problem.
paid by card or cash?

thank you.
we don't expect our economy picked-up earlier than HK's.
namson Lau, you smart dude!
well, thanks for your teaching.
I taught you the speech but you put them together and act it well.
I never doubt my acting skills. They never see it through.

not only the new studio,
I am also thinking about the Blackpool Ballroom Dance Championship in England
who shall I give credit to when I win?
whatever you wish...
business is your priority.

it's not easy to earn a living. Don't waste your money.
you're so funny.
do you have any part-times for me?
I can get you to be a hooker.

Mr. Lau is hiring a maid.
being a maid must earn more than a hooker to you.
you're so funny!
Really?
screw you!
don't screw me! I'm falling!
I bet Tina and her brother are step-siblings.
one smiles all the time; the other looks frustrated for all times.

starting from the first move...
I am sorry.

elegance is the most important in Tango.
don't you give me the little moves!
just trying to have fun.
what is so fun?
everyone in the Christmas ball is social elites.
you're my partner. I don't want anybody to laugh at you.
besides, don't you dare to stick those glitter stickers on your ears, like those cheap stars!
of course, I won't.
what toady!
this is much better.
Mr. Lau.
let's try again.
Faye, where is your dog food!
so are you.
you're worse!
miss Cheung, have a glass of water.
miss Cheung, you're the best!
I think you're toadier.
I think you're toadier, stupid!
toady is toady, so what?
which part of me is toady?
all heroes are toady before they are known.
who care how toady I was if I became a world champion?
here...
you're Toady Mother.
you're the Toady King.
I'm Toady Pussy.
miss Cheung...
you're the best!
I don't care whether you're toady.
as long as you are rich, there is not a problem.
you're the Toady King and I'm the Toady Pussy.
I'm a Toady Zombie.
I can't believe you're still here.
Yes, I just finished polishing your shoes. I'm leaving now.
do you want me to cook?
no, thanks.
aren't you hungry? No, not really.
I wanna ask you something.
go ahead, boss, what's it?
come on, don't call me boss. We're all the same.
don't you realize I always ask you to do me favors?
do you think I'm taking advantage over you?
I think it's reasonable enough to do you favors.
did you cheat me on those Soul-catching shoes?
no, of course not!
that pair of shoes has been with me for over 10 years.
Oh...

is that it?

very shining.
you lighten up when you dance!

Yes.

boss...

What're you doing?

but it doesn't work.
it's broken. It won't turn anymore.
some of my old birthday gifts.
Really?
Chuck it.
Chuck it? It's your birthday present!
Yes, do you like it?
Yes!

what variations?
world champion is the best.
whatever.
dummies gathering.
what are they laughing at all day?
they're happy. They laugh when they're happy.
happy? I haven't been happy for ages.
what?
I was thinking...
what are you thinking?
I can't think of it. Wait, other may think of it.
what are you talking about?
you talk as if you're mixing your disc.
don't think too much.

Mr. Lau isn't happy recently.

I want pork!
chicken is better! Pork is better!
once I've waited
for my true love
hanging out in the street
I wish you are by my side
feel like when we first met
Tina, you're late.
he mimics jacky Cheung. Really well.
how well?
take this seat.
in fact...
I have to give my gratitude to someone who makes me who I am today.
and this is our honored guest.
let's welcome...
special guest furthermore.
I asked you to go home early
you told me you did not want to go
you asked me to hold you tight
a gust of sea breeze came
to blow out the burning flame
I saw you feeling upset
how could I afford to go?
even the eay you cried touched me
only I could kiss off your tears
let the wind continue to blow
never wanted apart
I always want
to be with you all the time
the wind continue to blow
never wanted apart
my heart broke into tears
yet holding back my tears in front of you
together we seek
for our past happy memories
I wish to wash away the pain
and recall our shared sweet moments
trying to hold back the tears
not letting them fall
feeling frustrated and stressed
knowing that we will be separated, tears betrayed me
I have brought you happiness

would you care to dance?
dance WITH THE WIND
park Poongshik... When l met him, l was living a flat, dry life without a breeze in sight.
Yes, don't worry sir...
l'll check into it.
Yes, immediately sir.
lt's freezing, why aren't you inside?
what's this?
open it.
name, PARK Poongshik. Age, mid-thirties.
the most notorious scamp north of the river, a legend in his field.
he only deals in rich housewives.
and that scumbag got the chief's wife for close to $30, 000.
the chief is so pissed, he says he'll shoot the bastard.
so?
so, we have to catch him!
then go catch him.
would l have called you if it were that simple?
the chief's wife denies that he did anything wrong.
on the contrary, she's worried sick that he'll be hurt.
so what are we supposed to do?
there's only one way.
we have to make him confess.
how?
that dirty scamp is in the hospital now.
you're going undercover as a car accident victim.
do your duty, right now!
meanwhile, l'll comfort the chief.
does it have to be me?
this is your speciality.
what is it now?
Yeonhwa, what will l do?
we're in trouble again.
l told you to divorce him.
not your dad, it's your brother this time.
what is it now?
he got drunk again and hit his wife.
l'm going crazy!
his father-in-law says he'll put him behind bars.
come quick and try to do something, huh?
just let him go to jail.
how can you say that, - you nasty wench? - l'm busy, bye.
l know you're busy, but your brother's going to jail...
l broke my neck in a car accident!
leave me alone!
l believe it still works.
good day.
hello.
l'll just step out for a bit.
Oh, yes!
where is it that you go each day?
l have to see someone.
a woman, perhaps?
good day.
God, what style!
was that man discharged just now?
he's going out for a bit.
where is he going?
how would l know?
can a patient just go in and out like that?
what, do you think this is some kind of jail?
what the hell?
dammit!
shall l help you?
step aside.
you seem to dislike machines.
Oh, gosh.
l have some freshly ground coffee in my room.
would you care for a cup?
freshly ground...?
lt's called Columbian Supremo.
the fragrance is excellent.
come in.
have a seat.
Yes.
you're quite comfortable here.
you could call this my home.
why is that?
l've been booted out. My wife divorced me.
that's destiny for you.
we had a slight misunderstanding, but it...
did you read those books, or are they for decoration?
Yes, reading is my hobby - Can l use the bathroom?
please. Be my guest.
try it. The fragrance is wonderful.
machine coffee can't compare.
thank you.
lt's tasty.
say, " the fragrance is wonderful. "
the fragrance... is wonderful.
lsn't it?
this fragrance is my happiness.
um, can l ask you something?
of course.
what do you do?
l am an artist.
Oh, really?
what art form do you pursue?
the art of dance.
dance?
ballroom dance.
Oh, right...
are you familiar with ballroom dance?
well... the thing people do in cabaret bars...
you know...
that's what l figured.
no need to be sorry.
at first, l felt the same way.
how did you come to take up dancing?
destiny.
destiny?
Yes, destiny.
destiny that l could not refuse.
l'm afraid it would take all night to tell you.
well, l've got time.
l mean, it's so boring here.
l'm curious what other people are doing with their lives.
Yes, at such times it helps to hear about others.
exactly.
where shall l begin?
l used to be a dull, tedious fellow.
at some point, without any reason, l began to live my life with no meaning at all.
like a cactus in the desert, with no breeze to console it.
and at one point l stopped even asking myself, why l lived like that, or how l'd turned out that way.
mister, just leave it.
the news will be on after the ads.
you're watching it? l didn't realize...
then one day, a person l met changed my life.
welcome! - Hello, hello.
what'll you have, sir?
Yes, one bottle of soju...
what do you have that's good?
everything's good.
well, some chicken giblets. And one grilled fish.
and a bit of snail salad...
do you have egg rolls?
of course.
then fry me up one of those.
Yes, coming right up.
lt's been ages since l've visited a soju tent. How's business?
Ah, so-so.
nobody drinks cheap liquor these days, all trying to act rich.
some people come here asking for whiskey.
Fools...When did they all start drinking whiskey?
Hey, Poongshik!
lt's me, Mansu!
3rd year, Kangsan High!
Oh, Mansu...
where did you get so drunk?
my brother is home already.
do you think your brother is the only friend l can drink with?
friend?
l see you met another loser like yourself.
Oh, l'm drunk.
l feel like hell.
but l feel good, too.
nice to drink some expensive liquor.
every day l drink soju with fish broth.
for the price of that whiskey, l could drink two months.
tell the Madame to come in!
l've got money.
how many days in a row is this?
ls it raining? What the hell?
l gotta go...
what's this room for?
for educating saleswomen.
and sometimes for storage.
have some coffee.
but how did you know l was here?
l knew it from the start.
l just didn't want to embarrass you.
l came to ask you a favor.
what favor?
that room must be empty during the day. Let me use it.
for what?
for some business.
you'll find out soon enough, but business is tough these days.
president, local chapter of Nat'l Association of Motion Arts.
what is this?
just as it says.
kind of a leisure sports instructor.
motion Arts...
are you teaching taekwondo?
not taekwondo, dance.
dance? What kind?
ballroom dance.
what's ballroom dance?
you know, what they do in cabaret bars...
are you one of those guys who swindle women?
Yes!
damn gigolo.
you can't use the room! Beat it!
one, two, three da four. Good!
so, beautiful!
what's wrong with you?
what the hell is this?
that room's empty.
he pays well, so l'm happy.
for a few extra bucks, you let him defile our clean office?
l don't care if he seduces women.
l'll do anything for cash.
come on!
he's buying us drinks tonight at a really posh bar.
why is the day so long?
that looks fun! Should l join too?
can we?
ladies, please!
go do some work.
this kind of thing is how families get broken.
this is harder than l thought.
try it again.
dammit, l'm busy!
Hey, come here.
what is it?
l can't go on like this.
what?
help me. l can't handle all those women by myself.
so you're asking me to teach dance like you?
lt's easy.
learn from me for 3-4 days, and it'll be a piece of cake.
you're insane!
Hey, have some consideration.
how can l just turn away all those women?
l'll pay you well, okay?
forget it.
l'll give you half the lesson fees.
l'm not interested.
okay, okay.
you drive a hard bargain.
you take all the lesson fees.
l don't want your money, you scum!
all right, all right.
let's do it this way.
try learning a bit from me.
just try it, and if you end up liking it, you help me.
and if you don't, then hit me.
l know you want to hit me.
ln Korean cabaret bars, people usually dance jitterbug or blues.
but you won't catch anyone's eye doing that.
the mother of the jitterbug is the jive.
jive!
lf you just master that, you'll be king of the cabaret.
you'll be fighting them off.
just teach me anything.
let me just tell you this.
this dance requires strong athletic ability.
a three minute song will have more than 400 steps.
and not in one place, you'll be steppin' and slidin' all over...
do you ever shut up?
all right, all right.
don't be nervous, now we're about to start.
easy, huh? Try it.
lift your hand.
like this?
lt's a simple step, why do you talk so damned much?
when l took my first step, l felt a shiver through my whole body.
why hadn't l learned this before?
lt seemed so unfair that hadn't known.
without realizing it, l let out a sigh.
l just went crazy about dancing.
and to that scoundrel who taught me to dance, l was insanely grateful.
brother! What happened here?
who did this, huh?
go ask that bastard Mansu.
some guy came this morning and trashed the place.
he said his wife had an affair and ran off.
that Mansu... damn.
Mansu, that bastard!
Hey, Poongshik!
that bastard.
l hear the office got trashed?
you dirty bastard!
you think it's funny?
what? What did l do wrong?
what did you do wrong?
lsn't it obvious?
damnit!
that stupid bitch went and found God at the crucial moment.
you're supposed to confess in church, not to your husband.
damn l'm unlucky.
but no need to worry.
l'm not giving up now.
rather than waste my time sneaking around, l'll go to jail, get fit, and polish up my dance steps.
then l'll come out.
you asshole.
Hey, no need to swear.
before l go, l'll give you one of my secret tips.
when you dance, put these walnuts in your pocket, and rub them up between your partner's thighs.
then it's game over. She's be all over you.
now l've given up another secret!
do you think l study dance to become like you?
then why do you do it?
what do you mean, bastard?
there's no goal in dancing.
l just like to dance.
Hey, do you think dancing is art? Snap out of it!
you've got a real problem here.
l'm leaving.
which police station should l go to this time?
at that moment, something stirred in my chest, a desire to learn dance properly.
l had to restore honor to the art of dance, which had been besmirched by swindlers like Mansu.
so from then l began a quest to learn dance in depth.
but unfortunately, l couldn't find any real teachers.
so l left my home, asking around for teachers, and searching them out.
what about your family?
back then, l couldn't even think of them.
excuse me, sir.
who is it?
l'd like to study dancing.
we don't teach disco.
l know. l came to learn ballroom dance.
why does a young guy like you want to learn?
because l like it.
l guess the teacher hasn't arrived yet?
l'm the teacher...
you are?
you haven't heard about me, have you?
most people know who PARK Mu-shin is.
Oh, really?
so when will you start?
well, l think l'll check a few more places first.
later, l will visite you again
grandpa, l'm ready.
okay, let's give it a try.
as you wish.
master!
please accept me.
stupid!
cast off your old thoughts, l said!
you're learning for the first time today.
you're drawing a new painting on a white piece of paper.
three da four? lt's " three and four. "
my teacher was a ballroom dance pioneer who had studied in Japan.
lt was fundamentally different from those cheap dance classes.
more exalted than tao training, more difficult than asceticism, freer than flying in the sky...
lt was a special process, difficult even to describe.
stupid!
ln taking my first step into the exalted world of art, my heart was bursting.
grandpa! - Master!
out of the way!
are you okay, master?
you've just taken your first step... - Master, hold on!
master!
sorry... l had so much more to teach...
no master! No, don't!
my work is done!
having lost my first mentor, l set off once again to find a new teacher.
after crossing the country to learn dance, l returned home.
five years had passed.
what kind of a jerk is he?
he left his wife and kid to run off and learn dancing?
for five years? What an ass.
officer PARK, could there have been some mistake?
what?
ls he really a swindler?
what kind of swindler studies dance that way?
what do you mean? He robbed the chief's wife.
there's nothing after that.
Why?
lt was morning by then.
the doctors started their visits.
so he didn't even get to the main story?
that's why l said l'd call you when it's done.
stopping by without warning...
l'll call you.
yes Chief, good news.
things are progressing faster than l thought.
Hey, Yeonhwa!
you bitch.
you told them to put me in jail, huh?
let go.
ls that how you talk to your older brother?
you think you have no family, huh?
just thinking of yourself, bitch?
l said let go!
come here!
l'll knock some sense into you.
out of the way!
just ignore us and do your work!
who the hell are you?
release her.
ls this any way to treat an injured patient?
who the hell are you, bastard?
l am hospitalized together with Yeonhwa.
l'm an artist.
huh? What the hell kind of freak is this?
not a freak, an artist.
out of my way! l'm going crazy here.
then you belong in a lunatic asylum.
goddamn it! - Damn you!
Ouch, Yeonhwa!...
you wanna be crippled?
all right, all right, l'll go.
let go.
release, please.
damn bitch.
let's see how well your life turns out.
what the hell
stop staring!
drink up.
one more
my life is funny, huh?
not at all.
wow, drinking soju in a place like this feels so elegant. Great weather...
do you enjoy life?
pardon?
l said do you enjoy life?
sure. After all, l have my dancing.
then let's try out your dance.
l said teach me.
l don't teach dance for fun.
do you think l'm looking for fun?
very well.
what shall l teach you?
whatever. Something dazzling, if possible.
then jive it is. This way, please.
now, jive is referred to as the mother of the dance jitterbug...
lt's in 4: 4 time... - Got it. Let's dance.
Yes, look here.
this is the basic step.
one, two, together, apart...
easy, no? Try it yourself.
raise your arms like so. That's right. Now, begin!
what's wrong?
what about the shivers down my spine?
not for everyone, perhaps.
let's continue.
what are you doing these days?
what the hell's going on with PARK Poongshik?
lt seemed too easy at first, why is there no progress?
are you stalling on purpose to get back at the Chief and me?
officer PARK...What do you think of ballroom dance?
they say in other countries, 5-year olds can learn it.
lt's as acceptable as walking hand in hand.
what are you talking about?
why do we get so worked up over it?
yes?
what are you doing?
Oh, nothing... - Are you going out?
l'm tired of staying in, it's stifling.
l see.
come on. Get dressed.
lt's so nice here.
l wish l could build a house here and live with no worries.
you're much improved.
what is?
your face.
Really?
you look good.
l'm so curious.
about what?
how a person like you could get divorced.
lt's an artist's pain.
tell me about it.
why your wife divorced you.
that's a long story as well...
we've got lots of time!
shall l?
where did l stop last time?
you returned home after studying how to dance.
so after traveling the country five years to study dancing, l returned home.
but the world l lived in was not hospitable to dancers.
there was no place to study, or to dance as l wished.
my whole body ached to dance, and l became furious that l couldn't.
what?
what kind of man are you?
you return after five years, and now you're a bum?
you want me to die from anger, is that it?
do you have any idea how l've lived all this time?
do you know how
Byungguk and l suffered?
l knew you'd be fine.
what?
you dirty bastard, you!
Misook! - Are you human? Are you?
go die on the street!
l couldn't take it any longer.
l was about to go insane.
so without choice, really with no other choice, l visited the pit of indecency, the cabaret bar.
welcome!
even though, l found myself in such a place.
l desired for the real dance.
but it wasn't easy to find the right partner.
excuse me.
did you come alone, by any chance?
Yes, why?
lf you need a partner, would you care to dance?
l don't do that kind of dance.
do you know how to dance the waltz?
do you dance well?
l can dance pleasurably.
l was happy as a bird out of its cage.
lt didn't matter where l was.
just the fact that l was dancing made me unspeakably happy.
and not just me, she was happy as well.
we danced together each day in complete happiness.
but she wanted more from me than just dancing.
l won't go home alone tonight.
l'm starving... please feed me.
a dancer should do anything to make his partner feel happy.
so l did my best for the sake of her happiness.
mister PARK! Can you go faster?
how is this place?
when l'm lonely, l come here alone to wallow in my misery.
do you like it?
lf you like it Madame, then so do l.
how can you be so different?
different?
from the man they call my husband.
he doesn't have a clue of what it is that l want or like.
he doesn't show the slightest interest in me.
you know what? Just seeing his fat head makes me want to kill him.
dancing is the only way l get by.
you don't mind if l drink tonight?
Madame please, don't be upset.
forget it.
l just didn't want to take advantage of you.
l know, l know... But l just feel miserable.
l'm a woman after all, how could you spend the night in the same room, and not even think of touching me?
lt wasn't like that...
lgnored at home, ignored outside...
l feel so wretched. Wretched.
don't worry about me. lt'll pass.
what is it?
l never intended to hurt your feelings.
you did nothing wrong, Mister PARK.
lt's okay, go on.
l... To be honest with you...
last night was the longest night of my life.
you are so sexy and beautiful that l can hardly control myself.
mister PARK! ls that the truth?
madam, you know that l cannot tell a lie.
mister PARK!
l...
that wasn't what l meant...
l know, l know... - Madame, we shouldn't...
this wasn't my intention...
we shouldn't...
l swear to God, l had no other choice.
l was being courteous to my partner, and she was being honest about her feelings.
but l felt responsibility as a father and husband, so l resolved not to meet her again.
and l didn't contact her.
but then she wouldn't stop calling me.
who is it?
mommy!
l thought she would stop.
but as time passed, it began getting worse.
so finally l called her.
l had to see her one last time.
is this the last one? - I don't know.
there's no ether, either.
Jesus Christ.
you there! Is this the last one?
God, what a mess.
at least there's no gangrene.
there will be if it doesn't come off soon.
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.
I'm sorry.
let's coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.
God!
glass.
is that Tucker's men? - Yes, sir. I think it is.
how long has it been like this?
we found 'em this morning, sir. They've been here for two days.
is that you, Lieutenant?
sons of bitches.
come on. You better take cover.
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters. Come on. Go under cover.
there you go.
you went to the hospital?
it was no good.
what's going on here?
what's going on here?
that seems to be the question, all right.
see, you could ask the major...
...but he don't know.
he's busy.
he's busy trying to figure out how come the officers' mess...
...run out of peach ice cream.
then, of course, you got the general.
he come up to see the show.
all he knows is there ain't no show...
...which ain't entirely correct 'cause we started a balloon up...
...but they shot her down before we got off the ground.
nobody's made a run either way. It's been a standoff all damned day.
now, the major, he's looking at the general.
he's thinking to himself, "I better do something.
you know what that means.
I sure as hell don't want to be the first one across this field.
they're supposed to be beat up just like us.
hell, everybody knows Tucker's men are tough as cobs.
so far, the only thing been killed out here is three milking cows.
course, that's about to change.
you son of a bitch.
you know, some of the boys are saying if we ain't gonna fight...
...we could just settle this whole business with a little...
...high-stakes poker.
wouldn't that be a sight?
a bunch of fellas sitting in the middle of this field...
...drawing cards.
what is it, sir?
looks like a suicide.
Tucker!
what's he doing?
what did you say to him? - I didn't say nothing.
come on back, you son of a bitch!
you won't make it no second time! - All right by me.
forgive me, Father.
he's coming back again! - Here he comes, boys!
ready! - I got him.
don't...
don't take off my foot.
you rest easy, son. You'll keep your foot.
with God as my judge, you'll keep it.
bring up my ambulance. - Sir?
bring up my ambulance, and bring my surgeon with it!
we got an officer who's worth something lying here.
the strangeness of this life cannot be measured.
in trying to produce my own death...
...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.
I was also awarded Cisco...
...the trusty mount that carried me across the field that day.
and on full recovery, was given transfer to any station I desired.
the bloody slaughter continues in the east as I arrive at Fort Hayes.
a tiny island of men and material surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie.
lieutenant.
where can I find Maj. Fambrough?
down at the end of the hall.
thank you.
lt. John J. Dunbar.
lt. John J. Dunbar?
Yes, sir. - "Yes, sir."
indian fighter.
excuse me?
it says here that you're to be posted on the frontier.
the frontier is Indian country.
I quickly deduced that you're an Indian fighter.
I did not ascend to this position by being stupid.
no, sir. - "No, sir."
it says here that you've been decorated.
Yes, sir.
and they sent you here to be posted?
actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.
Really? Why?
I've always wanted to see the frontier.
you want to see the frontier?
Yes, sir.
before it's gone.
such a smart lad, coming straight to me.
sir...
...Knight.
I am sending you on a knight's errand.
you will report to Captain Cargill...
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...
...Fort Sedgewick.
my personal seal will assure your safety...
...through many miles of wild and hostile country.
I was wondering... - Yes?
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?
you think I don't know?
no, sir. - You think that.
it's just that I don't know... - Hold your tongue.
I am in a generous mood and I will grant your boon.
see that peasant out there?
he calls himself Timmons.
he's going there this very afternoon. You can ride with him if you like.
he knows the way. Thank you. That is all.
sir Knight?
I've just pissed in my pants...
...and nobody can do anything about it.
to your journey!
to my journey!
haw!
over a little bit, Jim!
have this by tomorrow. - Yes, sir.
I'll have my crown now.
sir? - I'll have my crown now!
I'm sorry, sir. - Are you deaf, fool?
I said I'll have my crown right now!
now!
no.
I'll get your crown. - No.
sir?
major?
the king is dead.
long live the king.
get these kids out of here, come on!
haw, Jim and Jake!
gee a little bit, Jim!
the hell was that?
what is that?
what the hell is that?
why don't you put that in your book?
were it not for my companion...
...I believe I would be having the time of my life.
I know he means well...
...but he is quite possibly the foulest man I have ever met.
how far you make the Fort?
far.
how far?
forty, fifty mile, maybe.
what's the big hurry on Sedgewick?
it's to be my post.
my home.
you ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.
look yonder.
what you got there?
somebody back east is saying, "Why don't she write?
you stupid bastard.
get up, Timmons.
get up.
get up.
come on. Get up.
get up!
someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?
goddamn it!
I'm gonna have a welt.
cpl. Guest?
you don't have to talk to me, just please come out.
it's the end.
assemble the men in front of my quarters.
you hate me.
but I feel none of the same for you.
you men stayed.
you stayed after they took all our horses.
you stayed after all the others deserted.
you stayed after the army failed to resupply us.
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...
...just as you have...
...day after miserable day.
and all I can say is that I'm proud of you.
now get your things, men. We're leaving this place.
the army can go to hell.
go.
get your things.
how come we haven't seen any buffalo?
you can't figure the stinking buffalo.
you can't. Sometimes you won't see any for days.
other times, they'll be thick, like curls on a whore.
what about Indians?
Indians? Goddamn Indians!
you just as soon not see 'em unless the bastards are dead.
they're nothing but thieves and beggars.
ho, up there!
not what you would call much of a going concern now, is it?
go down there.
Why? There ain't nothing down there. - Because I said.
go down there.
there, son of a bitch!
there ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.
there ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.
lieutenant!
everybody's run off or got killed.
all right. Let's unload the wagon.
what? What, and leave it all here?
I'm staying, too.
there ain't nothing here.
no, not at the moment.
we don't know what's happened.
things being as they are...
...we might as well just turn around and get headed back.
this is my post.
this is my post?
this is my post.
this is my post?
Jesus H. Christ.
what, are you crazy, boy?
fast son of a bitch.
Jesus H. Christ. - This is my post.
all right, put it down.
and these are the post provisions, all right? Now get your ass off the wagon...
put it down! - And help me unload.
we're just havin' a conversation, now put it down.
I'll let them know where you are.
good.
good luck.
thank you.
Jake and Jim!
good mule!
haw up there now!
good mules!
have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted.
am now waiting for garrison's return or word from headquarters.
the post is in exceedingly poor condition...
...and I have decided to assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.
supplies are abundant...
...and the country is everything I dreamed it would be.
there can be no place like this on Earth.
bad horse.
bad horse.
the animals in the pond had not been poisoned.
they had all been shot.
but why? Was it for sport?
could it have been out of spite?
my first guess would have been that the men here were starving.
but this rotting waste speaks to the contrary.
the caves are an even bigger mystery.
what could have driven men to live in caves?
perhaps they were frightened.
maybe there had been some sort of revolt.
I can make no sense of the clues left me here.
perhaps my relief will provide the answers.
come on, Cisco. One more time.
git up!
come on! Git up, Cisco.
git up!
git up! There you go!
easy.
only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see.
maybe there's more than one.
there might be three or four.
I know three or four...
...who will not be making the trip back home.
we have nothing to show for this trail.
we have no rifles.
white men are sure to have rifles.
it's hard to say how many might be down there.
we should forget this and go home.
then go.
I would rather die...
...than argue about a single line of smoke in my own country.
he will not quit until we are all dead.
and if I...
look at me.
don't hurt my mules.
stop.
stop it.
please don't hurt my mules.
I am pleased with my efforts thus far.
for all my improvements, though, there remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.
an injury that goes beyond neglect and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.
it's been almost 30 days.
I have come to enjoy the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.
especially my daily reconnaissance rides with Cisco.
each day, we go further into the prairie and every discovery...
...big or small, becomes etched in my mind forever.
it would seem I've been marooned, as no one has yet come for me.
I can only assume that there is a problem, which the army will solve shortly.
maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...
...but when I look to the eastern horizon...
...I never fail to hope that a column might be out there.
still no sign of Capt. Cargill's command.
though well-supplied, I've decided to ration my goods...
...as if I were part of a post instead of the whole affair.
there's a wolf who seems intent on the goings-on here.
he does not seem inclined to be a nuisance, however.
and aside from Cisco, has been my only company.
he's appeared each afternoon for the past two days.
he has two milky white paws.
if he comes calling tomorrow...
...I will name him Two-Socks.
almost a month and no one has come.
the longer this condition persists...
...the less inclined I am to believe that anyone will.
rain has forced me indoors for most of two days now...
...and I have begun work on an awning.
it is the loneliest of times for me now...
...but I can say honestly that I am not unhappy.
how can I marry a pretty little girl "When I got no coat to put on?
soldier, soldier "Won't you marry me " before the fight comes home?
how can I marry a pretty little girl " when I got no shoes to put on?
how can I marry a pretty little girl " when I got no hat to put on?
soldier, soldier, won't you marry me " before the fight comes home?
how can I marry an ugly little girl " when I got a pretty wife back home?
you there!
have made first contact with a wild Indian.
one came to the fort and tried to steal my horse.
when I appeared, he became frightened and ran off.
have decided to bury excess ordnance lest it fall into enemy hands.
keeping only the barest necessities for myself.
my afternoon rides have been pared down to short circular patrols...
...always keeping the post in sight.
am taking steps to prepare for another visitation.
do not know how many more might be in the vicinity...
...but am assuming that where there is one there's sure to be another.
most of my work has been geared toward creating the illusion...
...of strength and stability.
I'm still alone, however, and unless troops arrive soon...
...all may be lost.
kicking Bird has been keeping to himself these last few days.
I do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone.
what does his wife say?
she says that he is keeping to himself.
that's not what I asked you.
well, what did you ask me?
what did she say?
she said that he is keeping to himself these days.
that's what she says.
make sure that my meat is soft.
my teeth hurt.
may I come in?
no, let him sit with me.
our country seems good this summer...
...but I have not been out to see it.
but the buffalo are late.
and I always worry about the bellies of our children.
I was thinking of a dance.
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.
it would be good to have a strong sign.
there's a funny thing about signs.
we know when they are bad or good.
sometimes they are strange and it's hard to understand them.
a smart man will think on these things.
if he is still confused, he will tell somebody.
for instance, he might tell you or me.
a smart man always does this.
I have seen such a sign.
Really?
I saw a man.
a naked, white man.
are you sure it was a man?
I saw his sex.
did you speak to him?
no.
it's been two days now, and nothing.
my presence here must have been reported by now.
have made all the preparations I can think of.
cannot mount an adequate defense as I am still alone.
but will try to make a big impression when they come.
waiting.
Post-script...
the man I encountered was a magnificent-looking fellow.
he might be a god.
or a white chief with special abilities.
that is why we should talk with him.
I do not care for this talk about this white man.
whatever he is, he is not a Sioux, and that makes him less.
when I hear that more whites are coming, I want to laugh.
we took a hundred horses from these people.
there was no honor in it.
they don't ride well. They don't shoot well.
they're dirty.
those soldiers could not even make it through one winter here.
and these people are said to flourish?
I think they will all be dead soon.
I think this fool is probably lost.
wind In His Hair's words are strong and I have heard them.
it's true the whites are a poor race and hard to understand.
but make no mistake. The whites are coming.
even our enemies agree on this.
so when I see one man alone without fear in our country...
...I do not think he is lost. I think he may have medicine.
I see someone who might speak...
...for all the white people who are coming.
I think this is a person with which treaties might be struck.
kicking Bird is always looking ahead and that is good.
but this man cannot cover our lodges or feed our children.
he is nothing to us.
I will take some men.
we will shoot some arrows into this white man.
if he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.
if he has no medicine, he will be dead.
no man can tell another what to do.
but killing a white man is a delicate matter.
if you kill one, more are sure to come.
it's easy to become confused by these questions.
it's hard to know what to do.
we should talk about this some more.
that is all I have to say.
what's the matter, now?
we don't think this is such a good idea.
if we take the horse of a white god...
...they will make up songs about us.
maybe.
they will ask us to go on raids.
who gets the horse?
I do.
I do, but we share. Now who can say this is not a great plan?
it's always the same.
every time.
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.
we'll be heroes.
they'll write songs about us.
what happened?
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.
you shouldn't have fallen off. Now we'll get in trouble.
it was your idea.
my idea was only to take the horse, not fall down.
otter hurt himself.
what are you looking at? I'm the one who's hurt.
I will be when my father finds out. His bow will be across my back.
I am Wind In His Hair.
I am Wind In His Hair.
do you see that I am not afraid of you?
do you see?
the party that went against the Utes is coming back.
there are many hearts on the ground.
I realize now that I have been wrong.
all this time, I've been waiting.
waiting for what?
for someone to find me?
for Indians to take my horse?
to see a buffalo?
since I have arrived at this post I have been walking on eggs.
it has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.
tomorrow morning, I will ride out to the Indians.
I do not know the outcome or wisdom of this thinking...
...but I've become a target and a target makes a poor impression.
I am through waiting.
what are you looking at?
son of a bitch!
no. Wait.
wait.
wait.
you need help. You're hurt.
you need... - No!
let me... You need help.
you need help. You're hurt. Let me help you.
you're hurt.
don't.
she's hurt.
she's hurt.
you are not welcome here.
no. She's hurt.
go away from us.
you are not welcome. Go away from us.
stop.
the soldier did not come to fight.
he is going away and we will let him.
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.
we will go down and talk to the white man.
and find out why he is here.
if this council decides to talk to the white man...
...then it will be so.
but in my mind it's not right...
...that a chief as great as Ten Bears...
...goes to ask the business of a puny, trespassing white man...
...who has only a smart horse and a few white man's clothes.
I will not go.
you will go.
and you will go.
that is all I have to say.
welcome.
welcome.
Hi!
come.
please, sit down.
sit down.
wait just a... Just a minute.
his mind is gone.
tatanka. Buffalo.
Buffalo. - Tatanka.
Buffalo. Tatanka.
the fierce one, as I call him, seems a very tough fellow.
I hope I never have to fight him.
from the little I know, he seems to be honest and very direct.
I like the quiet one immensely.
he's been patient and inquisitive.
he seems eager to communicate.
I would conclude that he is a man of some weight among his people.
Buffalo.
I believe I made an even greater impression on their next visit.
I produced a coffee grinder, something none of them had seen before.
is the coffee not good?
it's too strong, maybe.
sugar.
put in.
taste it.
sugar.
you want some?
you want some?
that's a lot.
okay.
Yeah.
it's good to finally have some company.
so much goes unsaid and I have the feeling that these people...
...the quiet one in particular, want something from me.
made presents of coffee and most of the sugar.
it didn't figure to last anyway.
don't believe I go too far in saying...
...that a foundation for good relations is being laid.
stands With A Fist.
we will talk awhile.
your wounds are healing well?
Yes, they are.
you are happy here, with my family?
I am glad to be here.
I am missing my husband.
perhaps you will marry again when the time is right?
perhaps.
we have word from many places that the whites are coming.
they are coming into everyone's country.
I think they will soon be in ours.
this white man who lives at the old soldier fort...
I have visited him and I believe his heart is a good one.
I am afraid of the white man at the fort.
I am afraid he will tell others that I am here.
I am afraid they will try to take me away.
I've heard they take people away.
every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried.
I cannot make the white man language.
he cannot speak Sioux.
it has been a long time since I made the talk.
I want you to try.
I don't know how.
Yes, you do.
I can't.
I can't. It's dead in me.
I don't ask this for myself. I ask this for all the people.
he knows things about the whites which we do not.
now, you must remember.
I can't.
will she make the white words?
she won't try. She is being difficult.
well, she's the one who's crying.
perhaps the difficulty is yours.
Christine!
get 'em, Joe! Get them chickens!
Billy, you get away from those puppies!
Damn!
get the kids, and get them in the house.
go on!
Christine!
Christine! Where are you?
I'm up here, mother.
get down now. - Why?
just do it.
stay right where you are. Get back. Do you hear me?
Joe, get in the house right now!
Willie!
who is it, Willie? - They look like Pawnee.
my father and your father are talking to them.
what do they want? - I don't know.
go on. You heard him. Get out of here.
run, Christine!
I said run!
Joe!
Christine!
mommy!
come on, Two Socks. Bacon.
two Socks, like Cisco, has become a trusted friend.
he still won't eat from my hand...
...but his keen eyes and ears never fail to alert me when something is wrong.
tatanka.
no.
no, I haven't seen any buffalo.
sorry.
are you hungry?
are you hungry?
I have food. I have a lot of food.
nothing I've been told about these people is correct.
they are not beggars and thieves.
they are not the bogeymen they've been made out to be.
on the contrary, they are polite guests and have a familiar humor I enjoy.
real communication is slow, however...
...and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.
most of our progress has been built on the basis of failure...
...rather than success.
I've thought to inquire if the woman I found lived or not...
...but it seems far too complicated a subject, given our limitations.
one thing is clear, however. There are no buffalo.
and it weighs heavy on their minds.
yesterday's meeting was the best yet.
it seems I've been invited to the village and I'm looking forward to going.
we were waiting for you.
we were waiting for you.
now tell him we are glad that he is here.
hello.
you...
here...
good.
thank you. I feel good.
I feel good.
ask him why he is at the soldier fort.
the soldier fort.
wait.
what is your names?
our names? - What is his name?
he's right. Introductions should come first.
he...
he...
kick.
kick?
more.
more kick?
more kicking?
kicking.
bird? Bird, kicking bird.
kicking Bird.
what is he...
is he chief?
no.
a holy man.
holy man.
your name?
I don't... - How are you called?
get up?
stand up?
stands?
stands. Your name's "Stands"?
stands.
with. - With?
with. - Stands with?
fist?
Yes.
stands With A Fist?
stands With A Fist.
I'm John Dunbar.
John Dunbar.
dumb Bear.
no, not Dumb Bear.
Dunbar.
dun...
bar.
not Dumb Bear.
Dunbar.
there's been an exciting breakthrough with the Indians.
the woman I found on the prairie speaks English...
...and today, clear progress was made.
she is white, and though I cannot be sure how she came to be with these people...
...I can tell she is not a captive.
while I'm not afraid...
...I don't feel completely welcome by everyone in the village.
my being here must be Kicking Bird's idea.
he is very enthusiastic and like two children...
...we are both anxious to know more about each other.
but I find myself holding back.
for some reason, I am reluctant to answer all his questions.
maybe it's my sense of duty...
...but something tells me not to say too much.
it was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...
...and yet I look forward to another visit with my new neighbors.
this is still my home, however...
...and I remain watchful for my relief and can only hope...
...that my negotiations with the wild people of the plains will bear fruit.
buffalo!
buffalo! I've seen buffalo!
buffaloes!
tatanka.
Tatanka?
Yeah.
riders were sent out to pick up the trail.
in the time it took to gather my things at Sedgewick...
...the entire tribe was well on its way.
their efficiency and speed with which they moved...
...was enough to impress any military commander.
spirits are high, and overnight I've gone from a person of suspicion...
...to one of genuine standing.
I am greeted with open smiles and looks of appreciation.
in short, I have become a celebrity.
loo ten tant!
loo ten tant! - Loo ten tant!
scouts picked up the trail exactly where I said it would be.
it was not hard to find...
...a gigantic swath of torn-up ground extending to the horizon.
the numbers it took to create this impossible image...
...was hard to imagine.
loo ten tant!
loo ten tant!
who would do such a thing?
the field was proof enough...
...that it was a people without value and without soul.
with no regard for Sioux rights.
the wagon tracks leading away left little doubt...
...and my heart sank, as I knew it could only be white hunters.
voices that had been joyous all morning...
...were now as silent as the dead buffalo left to rot in this valley...
...killed only for their tongues and the price of their hides.
loo ten tant.
it was suddenly clear now what had happened...
...and my heart sank as I tried to convince myself...
...that the white men who'd been killed were bad people and deserved to die.
but it was no use.
I tried to believe that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...
...and the others who shared in the killing were not so happy for having done it.
but they were.
as I looked at familiar faces, I realized that the gap between us...
...was greater than I could ever have imagined.
as they celebrated into the night the coming hunt...
...it was hard to know where to be.
I don't know if they understood, but I could not sleep among them.
there had been no looks, and there was no blame.
there was only the confusion of a people not able to predict a future.
are you all right?
I can't.
no, I'm full.
I'm full, and I can't tell the story anymore.
no.
you want to try it?
you want to try it?
here.
I can't. This is too much.
good trade.
this is a good trade.
no, no, I can't. I'm full, I'm tired.
No!
loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!
tatanka. Big tatanka.
big tatanka.
that's my hat!
you're wearing my hat.
it's my hat.
I found it on the prairie. It's mine.
no, you...
my hat.
that hat belongs to the Lieutenant.
he left it on the prairie. He didn't want it.
well, you can see he wants it now.
we all know that it's a soldier's hat.
we all know who wears it.
if you want to keep it, that's all right.
but give something for it.
good trade.
there you are.
come here, Cisco.
it seems every day ends with a miracle here.
and whatever God may be, I thank God for this day.
to stay any longer would have been useless.
we had all the meat we could possibly carry.
we had hunted for three days, losing a half a dozen ponies...
...and only three men injured.
I'd never known a people so eager to laugh...
...so devoted to family, so dedicated to each other.
and the only word that came to mind was "harmony."
many times I've felt alone...
...but until this afternoon...
...I'd never felt completely lonely.
made a long patrol today.
there's nothing to report.
time seems irrelevant except for the fact that I am bored...
...and these hours alone are endless.
it is difficult for me to muster any enthusiasm...
...for my regular duties here.
and the fort is showing serious signs of neglect.
the truth is, I am missing the company of my friends.
I can see all of their faces, but somehow it is not enough.
tomorrow I will pay them a visit.
it may be forward of me, but what can it hurt?
after all, they are my neighbors.
the night sounds have become so familiar as to be comforting.
my life on the prairie's a good one and for the most part, I am content.
the Indians have a great pull for me that goes beyond curiosity.
there's something wise about them and I'm drawn to them...
...in ways much stronger than my obligations to the military.
go home!
damn him.
God! Go home!
go!
go home, Two Socks!
bad wolf!
you were right. He is a special white man.
he should have a real name.
it is autumn now and I am spending more time than ever with my friends.
they have given me my own lodge and I feel comfortable there.
we talk every day, but I know Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.
he always wants to know how many more white people are coming.
I tell him they will most likely pass through this country and nothing more.
but I am speaking in half-truths.
one day there will be too many, but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.
I am sure that Stands With A Fist knows that I am holding back...
...but to her credit, she says nothing.
a war party is going against the Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.
I sense I made a mistake in doing so...
...but I could not bring myself to take it back.
they are my friends, and from what little I gather...
...the Pawnee have been very hard on these people.
I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.
come in, please.
sit down?
kicking Bird want to know...
...why you want to make war on the Pawnee.
they have done nothing to you.
they are Sioux enemies.
only Sioux warriors to go.
tell him that I have been a warrior...
...Ionger than many of the young men who will go on this war party.
tell him.
he said that the Sioux way of being a warrior...
...is not the white way.
you are not ready. - I know, I understand.
tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.
he also asks that you...
...watch over his family while he is gone.
this thing he asks is a great honor for you.
tell him that I would be happy to watch over his family.
he thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.
who is Dances With Wolves?
it is the name which all the people...
...are calling you now.
dances With...
that's right.
that day.
dances With Wolves.
how do you say it?
keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.
I like to make the talk.
I'm here.
we walk.
I cut this off.
I shaved it off. More.
grass grows on the prairie.
"grass grows on the prairie"?
wrong. - Wrong?
you said, "Fire lives on the prairie."
I did?
no laughing, though.
that man is a fighter.
again.
that man is a fighter. - Okay, I have it.
Yes.
hoo hoo, right?
no?
try this.
what's the word...
...for beautiful?
what are you doing?
it's hot, and we are sitting in the shade.
I'm hungry.
how is Dances With Wolves?
what do you mean?
how is he learning?
he is a fast learner.
what did you think I meant?
you go for water, today?
then let us take you.
how did you get your name?
I was not very old when I came to be with the people.
and I was made to work.
I worked every day, very hard.
there was a woman...
...who didn't like me much.
she used to call me bad names, and sometimes she...
beat me?
and one day, she was...
...calling me these bad names...
...with her face in my face...
...and I hit her.
I was not very big, but she fell down.
she fell hard and didn't move.
and then I stood over her with my fist...
...and I asked if...
...there was any other woman...
...who wanted to call me bad names.
no one bothered me after that day.
no, I wouldn't think so.
show me.
show me where you hit her.
why are you not married?
I'm sorry. - I have to go.
I'm sorry.
can I help you?
you are not talking today?
no, I am not.
some of your words are wrong but you are learning fast.
so what can I tell you today?
I want to know about Stands With A Fist.
why is there no man with her?
she is in mourning.
I don't...
I do not understand "mourning."
she cries for someone.
cries for who?
it is not polite to speak of the dead.
but you are new, so I will tell you.
she cries for her husband.
he was killed not long ago.
that is how you came to find her on the prairie.
how long will she cry?
it is Kicking Bird's place to say when she is finished.
he's the one that found her when she was very little.
people are talking about you.
what are they saying?
they are proud of the medicine you are making with Dances With Wolves.
I have hurt him, and I should go talk to him.
you can't. He is gone.
he left this morning.
bet you were thinking:
now, why don't he write?
Hello, Two Socks.
come on.
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.
you can do this.
come on.
this is easy.
this is easy, Two Socks.
I am in mourning.
no, we cannot.
Yes. - We must be careful.
we must be careful.
okay.
wait!
what?
trouble.
the Pawnee are coming. A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.
hunters found them not far to the north. Soon be here.
stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.
the Pawnee do not come for horses. They come for blood.
get your weapons and come to my lodge.
I will get them.
stone Calf, wait.
I have guns.
I have many rifles.
at the fort? - Yes.
no. The ride is long and we can spare no men.
guns would make one warrior like two.
take one man and go quickly.
I will take Smiles A Lot.
shoot the gun!
it was hard to know how to feel.
I'd never been in a battle like this one.
there was no dark political objective.
this was not a fight for territory or riches or to make men free.
it was fought to preserve the food stores that would see us through the winter.
to protect the lives of women and children and loved ones only a few feet away.
stone Calf was a great loss, but even the old men could not remember...
...such a one-sided victory.
and I gradually began to look at it in a new way.
I felt a pride I'd never felt before.
I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.
perhaps the name itself had no meaning.
but as I heard my Sioux name being called over and over...
...I knew for the first time who I really was.
when we were younger, he always bragged about how brave he was.
and what a great chief he would make.
he thought I was impressed.
while walking on the prairie, we surprised a small herd of buffalo.
and the first thing this brave warrior did is run for a tree.
he would have forgotten all about me...
...if he hadn't needed my help to climb it.
and we sat there all day as this old cow circled below.
making loud noises and hitting her head against the trunk.
where are you going? There is gambling tonight.
Horseback's games are always good.
I'm tired. Horseback already has a good rifle of mine.
good night.
how long will Stands With A Fist mourn?
I don't know.
I hope it will not be too long.
has something happened?
what?
she has found love again.
with who?
who do you think?
tell me.
dances With Wolves.
are you certain of this?
when you see them together, you will know.
what are people saying?
they like the match.
no one is angry?
it makes sense. They are both white.
I suppose I will be the one to say something.
she's your daughter now.
I know.
relax. You can't see everything coming.
stop it. Quit your playing.
stands With A Fist.
you will mourn no more.
sit, sit.
there's talk that you want to get married.
to who?
to Stands With A Fist.
that's the one, isn't it?
she's in mourning.
not today.
kicking Bird has released her.
he did?
what are you doing here?
kicking Bird told me to wait.
you might have to wait a long time.
smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird riding on the prairie.
he says he was talking to himself.
a medicine man takes it pretty hard...
...when he is the last to know something.
what do I do?
you are pretty poor and a Sioux girl is not for free.
I don't know if you can get married.
I have the buckskin...
no, that's too much medicine.
do you think my horse is too much medicine?
for a girl.
wait here. Maybe we can help you.
wait.
that's all I do is wait!
the whole village was eager to take up a collection on my behalf.
the generosity of the people was astonishing.
the more valued the gift, the more easily it was given.
even the poorer families wanted to give up animals they could not afford.
it was hard to turn them away.
black Shawl was a mystery.
I couldn't guess what she was thinking and she offered no advice...
...no words of encouragement.
I may have been the brunt of an inside joke that included the entire village...
...but I was determined.
wind In His Hair told me if all the gifts were gone in the morning...
...my offer had been accepted.
I spent a sleepless night wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.
I had no idea what Kicking Bird's decision would be.
turn around.
you look good.
you know, the man she mourned for...
he was my best friend.
I didn't know that.
he was a good man.
it has been hard for me to like you.
I am not the thinker Kicking Bird is.
I always feel anger first.
there were no answers to my questions.
but now I think he went away because you were coming.
that is how I see it.
this is a good day for me.
and for me.
if you want this man, take his hand in yours.
I had never been married before.
I don't know if all grooms have the same experience...
...but as Kicking Bird began to speak about what was expected of a Sioux husband...
...my mind began to swim in a way that shut out everything but her...
...the tiny details of her costume...
...the contours of her shape...
...the light in her eyes...
...the smallness of her feet.
I knew that the love between us would be served.
have you heard all that I have said?
Yes.
good, then take her inside.
she is your wife.
good.
thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
dances With Wolves' door is closed a lot these days.
I think they're having trouble making a baby.
I don't think they're having trouble at all.
if we pull the smoke flap shut, they will come out for sure.
dances With Wolves, are you in there?
today I am riding away to a far away place.
I would like you to ride with me.
it's good to be out.
Yes, it must be.
we are trying for a baby.
no waiting?
no waiting.
I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life...
...there is one that matters most.
it is the trail of a true human being.
I think you are on this trail, and it is good to see.
we call you the Busy Bee.
it is said that all the animals were born here.
that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people.
even our enemies agree that this is a sacred place.
it's quiet here.
we must wait for these people.
no, they've been gone a week. Maybe more.
we will water the horses and go home.
you always ask about the white people.
you always want to know how many more are coming.
there will be a lot, my friend.
more than can be counted.
how many?
like the stars.
it makes me afraid for all the Sioux.
we should tell this to Ten Bears.
the men who wore this came...
...in the time of my grandfather's grandfather.
eventually we drove them out.
then the Mexicans came. They do not come here anymore.
in my own time, the Texans.
they have been like all the others.
they take without asking.
I don't know if we are ready for these people.
but I think you are right. I think they will keep coming.
when I think of that, I look at this helmet.
our country is all that we have, and we will fight to keep it.
tomorrow we will strike the village...
...and go to the winter camp.
you have everything from the soldier fort?
Yes.
there's nothing for me there.
that's good.
the journal.
stands With... Wait!
words are important!
the words in the book are like a trail for people to follow.
now, it tells everything about my life here. I must get it.
enough.
we cannot wait for you.
I'll catch up.
Injun!
get him! Injun!
No!
stay down. Stay.
my God.
God.
it's okay.
something has happened.
dances With Wolves is not coming.
he must have trouble.
pick two good men and send them back to the soldier fort.
Spivey.
Spivey! - Yeah, Sergeant.
tell the major he's waking up.
move your worthless ass.
you got yourself a hell of a shiner...
...didn't you?
major's coming through.
does he speak English?
I don't know, sir.
speak English?
talk English? Talk!
I speak English.
who are you?
lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.
why are you dressed like this?
I came out from Fort Hayes last April, but there was nobody here.
do you have proof of that?
my journal's on the bunk in my quarters. My orders are in the journal.
it will tell you everything.
Spivey, you and Edwards were the first ones here.
did you find anything? A journal?
no, we didn't find nothing, sir.
Where's Edwards?
he's outside.
he didn't find nothing either.
somebody find me Edwards.
you turned Injun, didn't you?
didn't you?
what did you say your name was?
Dunbar.
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.
you say you're an officer?
God. Did you read my orders? - No.
they're in my journal.
there are no orders.
there's no journal.
why are you out of uniform?
I have to relieve myself.
sergeant, take care of him. - Yes, sir.
let's go.
he's a white man. - Doesn't look white to me.
they say he's a soldier. - He's an officer.
do you salute him or shoot him?
here, you. Eyes front.
I said eyes front!
don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!
get him!
why are you out of uniform?
what's the army doing out here?
lieutenant's asking the questions. - Bauer.
we're charged with apprehending...
we're charged with apprehending hostiles and recovering stolen property...
...retrieving white captives taken in hostile raidings.
there are no hostiles. - We will ascertain that for ourselves.
if you'll guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter...
...your conduct will be re-evaluated.
what conduct? - With all due respect...
your status as a traitor might improve should you choose...
...to cooperate with the United States Army.
there's nothing for you to do out here.
are you willing to cooperate or not?
speak up!
I am Dances With Wolves.
what's that?
I have nothing to say to you.
you are not worth talking to.
sergeant, form a detail and take this man down to the river.
let him clean up his face. - Yes, sir.
not you, Spivey.
lieutenant.
major wants to see you.
Spivey.
Spivey. You got paper?
what's it to you? - Give me some, shit-bird.
can you read?
no, I can't read. What the hell's the difference?
you can't read either. Now just give me some.
quick, give me some! - All right. Hold your horses.
Bauer!
let go of me!
lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.
you son of a bitch!
it's all right.
it's all right.
he's going to get hungrier, that's all. But maybe that don't matter.
word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.
and once you get there, they gonna hang you.
come on. Forget about him. Go on. Get out of here.
get up in there!
Spivey, what is that?
looks like he's following us.
hell, I'm going to shoot him.
dang. You missed him.
don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot. - Wait. I seen him first.
get down! - Look at that stupid bastard.
he ain't even moving.
wait a minute! That's my shot. - Shoot him!
shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.
shoot him!
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!
Bauer, get him off him!
he might have killed you.
I'll get that son of a bitch.
sit down, goddamn it!
that's it. I got him!
dead shot, boys. Come on.
son of a bitch!
get up!
get up!
I mean it! Get up!
get up! Come on, get up!
what?
you bash that prisoner one more time, I'll put those shackles on you.
you men get back here!
goddamn it!
boo.
clear behind that stand of trees?
all right. Let's go.
I don't see nobody.
Indians!
no.
dances With Wolves is quiet these days.
is his heart bad?
killing the soldiers at the river...
...was a good thing.
I did not mind killing those men. I was glad to do it.
but the soldiers hate me now, like they hate no other.
they think I am a traitor.
and they will hunt for me.
and when they find me, they find you.
I think it would be wise to move the village now.
I will be leaving.
I must go and talk with those who would listen.
quiet. You are hurting my ears.
leave us alone.
you are the only white man I have ever known.
I have thought about you a lot. More than you know.
but I think you are wrong.
the man the soldiers are looking for no longer exists.
now there is only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves.
let's smoke awhile.
with Ten Bears, it was always more than a while.
there was purpose in everything he did and I knew he wanted me to stay.
but I was sure of myself.
I would be an excuse and that's all the army would need to find this place.
I pushed him as far as I could to move the camp...
...but in the end he only smiled and talked of simple pleasures.
he reminded me that at his age a good fire is better than anything.
ten Bears was an extraordinary man.
you have nothing to say?
what can I tell you?
what's ever on your mind.
you've made the decision.
my place is with you.
I go where you go.
you're not afraid?
no.
I told Ten Bears we'd leave when the snow breaks.
did you tell everyone?
not everyone.
it's all right.
you...
...finish your pipe?
good pipe.
how...
...does it smoke?
I've never smoked it.
we come far...
...you and me.
I will not forget you.
dances With Wolves.
I am Wind In His Hair.
do you see that I am your friend?
can you see that you will always be my friend?
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
dances with wolves...
sergeant! Over here! Now!
thirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.
what the hell are you doing here?
going undercover to catch a zucchini thief?
department shrink says...
I need a hobby.
I don't know.
how's Dean doing? Making any progress?
not yet.
he's still shaking down ice-cream stands with that moron Iggy.
if you ask me, we should skip over his dumb ass, come at this Victor guy from a different angle.
what do you have in mind?
well, we're trying to bust him for selling guns, right?
so why don't we pose as a buyer?
we tried that, remember? Last year?
he doesn't sell to strangers.
that doesn't mean we can't try again.
let Dean do his thing.
work Iggy, make Victor fall in love with him, and then get in the mix on the gun business.
patience.
whether it's growing tomatoes or busting Serbian gangsters, it's all about patience.
you look stressed.
Hey, you know, as a -- as a matter of fact, I am.
I'm very good at relieving tension.
ain't a vacation.
come on.
this is the day owner pays up.
no more excuses.
get out! Now!
okay, stop yelling for one second...
and listen.
listen to what? Sales pitch?
need insurance?
dangerous?
go screw yourself!
see what I mean about this broad?!
look, it's just 100 bucks a week.
that is all I'm asking!
screw off!
all right, fine. You take care of it. What?
unless you want me to go tell Victor you're afraid of old ladies?
what are you going to do, skinny?
hit me?
I don't want any trouble, okay?
just -- just give me 50 bucks.
50 bucks?!
in your ass!
way up high!
what does that even mean?
you ruin the neighborhood.
you burn my cousin's diner.
you evil people.
I call the police!
Oh, you're gonna call the police, huh?
yeah? Before or after the cpa in the next room gets his happy ending, huh?
whoa. Take it easy.
next time, I won't miss.
now get out. Okay, okay.
here you go, Iggy. See?
sometimes all you gotta do is ask nice.
why aren't we sitting over there, huh?
Victor only socializes with rich guys and hot chicks.
and we are neither.
he's kind of a snob, huh?
no, he's a maniac, is what he is.
so you best just shut your mouth and mind your own business.
I'm just saying, it wouldn't hurt to get a little bit of face time in.
Hey. I brought you in.
you meet who I want you to meet when I want you to meet.
you got that? Yeah.
did -- did he just smile at you?
Yeah. Why? That bad?
I don't know. Depends on his mood.
like I said, he's crazy.
Hey, did you give Mickey that insurance money we collected?
Yeah, I gave Mickey the insurance money we collected.
it was 600 bucks.
and it's chump change, Iggy.
I mean, when -- when are we gonna get to the good stuff, huh?
like guns.
which one of you is Dean? Me.
Victor told me to come over.
he said it's a reward for getting the chinese broad to pay.
I was there, too, you know.
I'm yours for the night, baby.
anything you want.
"destiny." That is a gorgeous name.
your parents -- they must be very spiritual.
not really.
no need to chat her up, dino. She's already paid for.
single and undercover.
Jaimie, nothing better than that.
except married and undercover?
Nope. Mel and I are cool.
what the hell happened?
Where's destiny?
Dean's moving up the ladder fast.
not too bad. Only 9: 30.
couple drinks? I'm buying. Tired.
looks like it's me and you, brother.
can't. I got a party to attend.
I hate to burst your bubble, but I go to parties.
I mean, not a lot, but...
I go.
Oh, now you're gonna -- now you're gonna act like you ain't got nothing to do with it, right?
you ain't had nothing to do with it.
you out of your mind.
Uh-oh! Look out, y'all. Po po's in the house!
how you doin', man? Great!
you know, living clean.
cholesterol's under 350 for the first time in years.
you're kidding. They got pills for that now, you know.
Yeah, well, I don't do drugs. I never have.
I used to sell the hell out of 'em for sure, but I ain't never done 'em.
you know that.
how you doin'?
slowing down a little bit, I hope.
Oh, come on, man, you got to take better care of yourself.
you got to eat healthy, you got to exercise.
I got a garden.
tomatoes.
tomatoes? What? Look at that.
five -- oh, five years?
are you kidding me?
everybody... Y-you mean a lot to me.
without y'all's help, I wouldn't be here.
I'd either be dead or...
or locked up, or living up in malibu with some fine-ass.
that's another story. That's another story.
tonight we're here to celebrate me being a law-abiding citizen for five -- come on, now, count 'em
five straight years!
to who? Freddy!
thank you very much.
so, uh, when are you gonna unpack?
I thought you said you were gonna help.
did I say that?
don't worry. I knew you were lying.
Ouch.
look...
I know you and, uh...
Scott broke up, but, uh...
Yeah, relax, Champ.
I'm not looking for anything serious, either.
well, this is what it is.
sex.
I gotta go.
forgot I gotta go shake down some tattoo parlor.
good luck.
Thanks. See you later. Oh, and...
don't try to impress me with an "I love jaimie" tattoo.
it won't work. I promise.
owner around?
can I help you? Yeah.
Hi. I'm Dean. Alex.
Hey, Alex. You must be new around here.
Yeah, we opened last week.
Yeah, well, I hate to break the bad news to you, but this is a pretty dangerous neighborhood.
there's a lot of robberies, vandalism, and theft.
my firm helps out in that regard, though.
it'll be $100 per week.
no special introductory rates?
mm, I'd have to ask my boss, Alex.
who's your boss?
people talk.
Victor sell anything besides insurance?
like what? Ecstasy.
no.
that's not what I heard.
so, you're telling me this Hornsby guy is better
they're in some book club together. His books are good.
okay, so he's funny, but Fitzgerald's a legend.
30, the promise of a decade of loneliness.
a thinning list of single friends. You get any money
a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm... No.
but...the owner...
is looking to buy some ecstasy.
so?
so, is Victor into that business?
I don't know anything about that.
you know what, Iggy?
it'd be a great way to move up the ladder.
I mean, Victor won't let us sell guns.
maybe he'll let us get in the mix in some -- some ecstasy.
the guy is clearly one of the penultimate writers of all time.
all right, Victor. You win.
and by the way,"penultimate" means "second to last,"
not "really ultimate."
what's that? What did you say?
what? "Penultimate.
no, you just used it in the wrong way.
that's all.
correct me in public again!
go ahead! Correct me again!
penultimate son of a bitch!
we sell insurance. Like I said, that's it.
now, just shut up, go back, and get some money.
all right? Can you do that?
forget about the drugs.
Yeah. Thank you.
uh, so how much you looking for?
5, 000 tabs.
can you handle that?
Yeah.
Yeah. Of course.
I'm gonna need some more time.
like how long?
uh...a couple days.
got anything on you now?
what, now?
no.
nothing?
no. Nothin'.
are you sure you don't?
Yeah.
yeah...
back away from the phone!
what the hell are you doing?
trying to Jack me?! Take it easy, okay?!
put the gun down now.
I said put the gun down.
okay.
you put that piece down, or I gonna blow her little brains.
listen to him, Bill.
he's a good guy. He just got a little spooked.
LAPD! Put the guns down now!
don't shoot!
put the gun down! We're FBI!
show 'em your badge, Bill!
let go!
what the hell's going on here?
you tell me.
Yes, we should have made sure lapd was up today regarding our investigation.
but the truth is, we've had problems in the past with leaks.
leaks? Are you suggesting somebody...
I'm suggesting we skip the interagency finger-pointing and figure out how to take down Victor uros.
what do you propose?
well, I propose you talk to my boss.
my apologies.
what are your plans, Agent Rice?
I think we should work together.
is that a polite way of saying you're taking over our investigation?
wasn't meant to be polite.
Dean's obviously made some inroads.
let's take advantage of that
use him to introduce me to Victor, we make a deal, and bust his ass.
a drug deal?
so you're convinced he's moving "x"?
we haven't been able to confirm that.
one of my informants identified him as a top ecstasy supplier.
he's new, but he's getting pretty big.
Oh, so that's why you're down here.
to chase a pretty big "x" dealer.
correct.
well, we've been trying to make a gun case, but if you like drugs better, we're happy to help.
in fact, I know someone who can help jump-start your investigation.
terrific.
but I'll have to go under as the buyer.
my contact doesn't like strangers.
whatever's most expedient.
expedient.
you see, that's why the feds make the big bucks.
in the meantime, I'll maintain my cover...
just in case.
awesome.
looks like this vegetable-garden thing is kind of working.
want to come over for dinner?
I can't. I have a date.
cream?
all I got's almond milk.
Really?
Victor uros. You ever hear of him?
uh, no.
word is he's moving lots of "x."
you want an introduction? Not a problem.
I still know a whole bunch of guys working that side.
what name you going by?
standard contract, 10% of the street value.
no, no. This one's on me.
on you? Yeah, yeah.
I owe you one, man, for that thing you did for my kid.
Aw, come on, man. That was no big deal.
Hey, look, you didn't get them assault charges dropped, Ray wouldn't be in the marines.
now, that's a big deal.
I'll call you later on today with a time and place.
how's that?
I like that.
nice to meet you, jimbo.
thanks for seeing me.
Freddy said if I needed some "x," I should talk to you and Victor, so, here I am.
how much you looking for?
depends.
on?
price.
we're not looking for new partners.
well, Freddy told me if I...
Freddy's cool, but he's been out of the business a while.
so what am I doing, wasting my time?
Hey, it's, uh, it's Dean.
c" block, pelican Bay.
Dean, Dean. Yeah.
how you been, man?
how you doing? Good, man.
it's been a minute, huh? Yeah.
sorry. Hey, good to see you.
you too.
nice kid, that Dean.
I mean, he's a bit...
but he's all right.
good to meet you, Jimbo.
is that it?
for now.
I see it didn't take you long to get used to the whole L. A. thing.
wheatgrass, lysine, and almond milk.
when did almond milk take over the world?
you want a sip? No.
still no word from George? "Still"?
it's been 24 hours.
that what you say when a woman doesn't return your call
it's only been 24 hours?
I don't date, but if I did, they'd call back.
a lot of confidence for somebody who can't make a deal with Victor's messenger boy.
have you er done this before? Done what?
make an actual buy and bust.
I'd be happy to unzip my pants, lieutenant.
Really?
hello. Hey.
Freddy, I told you not to push it.
of course I'm appreciative. I just...
Thanks, Freddy.
you're the best.
got a meeting with Victor.
wow, you were good.
my c. I. Set the meeting, not me.
and modest. I wasn't expecting that.
lieutenant...
thanks for being so patient.
it's not easy to have somebody take over your investigation.
so, how do you want to do this?
stay in the car, you hear gunshots...
come inside. You want a clock on it?
is that an insult? Where you going?
Freddy set up a meeting with your buddy Victor. When?
in an hour. No.
can't be.
what?
Victor left for Vegas two hours ago.
??
to set up another meeting.
I told him not to push, but...
he was a proud man.
he got upset when they didn't exactly roll out the red carpet.
I'm sorry.
do you have any other informants that could help?
I'm just trying to figure out our next move here.
our next move...
is to bust Victor for murder.
you got anything solid on him?
no, but he obviously ordered the hit.
well, that's your belief.
what are you talking about?
making a murder case involves more than a hunch, especially when the Vic is a career felon turned informant.
look, with all due respect, half of L. A. probably wanted this guy dead.
what's your point?
let homicide handle the murder.
our objective, our mandate is to take down Victor for drugs.
is that an order?
it doesn't need to be.
well, Dean...
looks like it's up to you.
I need you to get me a face-to-face with Victor soon.
Yeah, well, I mentioned it to Iggy, and he shot me down -- fast.
and that was before Victor got all paranoid and had Freddy capped, so...
I didn't say it'd be simple.
get iggy to the tattoo parlor.
I'll change his mind.
sorry about Freddy.
talk to the homicide guys?
Yeah. They're into it, but...
but not really.
C. I.'S don't exactly get top billing.
Yeah.
excuse me!
can I talk to you for a second, partner?
your plant's infected with the tospovirus, and we're all pretty concerned around here.
I'll take a look at it.
littering won't help, either.
we start small -- say 5, 000 hits.
it goes smooth, we'll go from there.
Plus, you can add a dime on the back end for the first five deals.
look, like I said, honey, we sell insurance.
then get the hell out of here.
can we have a second?
can I talk to you, Iggy? Please?
I don't know if you think it's Noble to be a doormat, man, but I don't.
Victor would have us whacked if he found out that we were dealing drugs.
or maybe he'd be impressed, huh?
Oh, what...Okay.
okay.
here's your chance, ace.
you wash my back, I wash yours, okay?
so, this actress chick I finally got a date with.
actress or porn star, Iggy? Come on.
she is legit. She has been on "all my children..."
once.
and anyway, she's got this friend that just got dumped by this dude.
doesn't want to spend the night alone.
so, she's saying that I gotta bring a cute guy with me, or else she's gonna cancel. Come on.
okay. All right.
I play your wingman...
and you bring my proposal to Victor.
Ah, yeah. I'll mention it to him, but that's it.
deal. All right, cool.
something I should tell you about her friend.
he's a dude.
so, they got the whole house surrounded, right?
and out comes Freddy.
hands up...
bare-ass naked!
yelling, "don't shoot! This ain't a rifle!"
Yeah. My man.
to Freddy.
sure you want to do this?
we need to draw out Victor's triggerman.
is this the best way to do it?
I don't know, but I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of it.
I'll tell you that much.
so, this tattoo chick, she says she can handle some heavy weight.
Hey, uh, if I may?
we seen the place.
I met this girl a bunch of times.
she's got tons of connections in the club scene.
this could be huge business for you.
okay.
but if it doesn't pan out, it's on you.
Thanks.
you won't regret it.
and who the hell are you?
you think you can kill my friend?
disrespect me?
I come to you like a man, like a professional, and you kill my friend?
nobody does that to me!
nobody!!
so here's the deal.
from now on, this is my backyard.
and I get 10% of any business you conduct.
you know who you're talking to?
that's for Freddy.
what the hell are you doing here?
I wanted a firsthand description of Carter's John Wayne act.
well, it was...
pretty nuts... In a good way.
look, I'm -- I'm starving. I was gonna cook.
you hungry? You cook?
Yeah, I cook.
helps relax me.
more than sex?
gonna grab some lo mein.
be back in 10 minutes.
give me the gun.
you work for Victor?
who the hell are you? Phil.
I work for Victor, too.
he says you know the guy who crashed his place today.
Yeah, we did some time together.
we need his address.
Why?
why do you think?
Hey! Good news. The plan worked.
managed to flush out Victor's killer.
some guy named Phil.
but the bad news is, he wants to kill you now.
good.
that's good?
okay, so tell me, Carter.
how does making yourself a target help solve Freddy's murder?
I have no idea.
I thought you were trying to be more responsible these days.
I am.
so, what do we know about this Phil guy?
he's Victor's friend, brother...
hired gun?
is he a pro...
or a believer? It makes a difference, you know.
think I got a fingerprint.
on your gun?
how'd that happen?
I think we got a break in the murder case.
on your informant's murder?
no, the Kennedy assassination.
what do you think?
the reason I'm confused is,
I told you to let the homicide guys take care of that.
well, the reason I'm confused is that murder is a better bust.
so what am I missing here?
why are you so against this? What is it? Ego?
or is it something bigger, like you don't really give a rat's ass about Victor?
I do give a rat's ass, but he's not the ultimate target.
so why lie about it?
I didn't think it was relevant.
because you were playing us.
and then Freddy gets clipped, and you start to get really nervous, because if we make a murder case, your whole fancy plan goes up in smoke, right?
because prosecutors don't give immunity in a homicide.
target's name is Daniel elson.
he's the major player involved in organized crime.
we were investigating him in San Francisco, but then he disappeared.
okay, so how does this all tie in to Victor?
we were up on elson's cell, and we picked up a phone call he made to Victor here in L. A. two months ago.
okay, let me get this straight.
you want to sell out Freddy's murder so you can impress your boss?
is that what you're telling me?
this is business. Don't make it personal.
you said that Victor okayed the deal with Iggy.
set it up for tomorrow.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
what the hell is this?
I didn't ask for this stuff.
what, are you joking or something?
you tell me.
wait, what are you doing?
you guys are cops.
this is entrapment.
cops?! Are you serious?!
Yeah, you know what, then?
deal's off.
come on. But
she thought we were cops.
like I said, she's crazy!
she's smart, you idiot.
10, 000 hits is a five-year minimum.
one tab less, and it's only a year.
so if she's a cop, she's gonna bust you.
and if she's not and she actually knows what she's doing, she's gonna think you're cops.
it was a test, Iggy.
a test.
that's right. She passed.
set up a meeting with her tonight, Iggy.
find jimbo's address yet?
uh, I'm working on it.
you're making me nervous, Dean.
what a pleasant surprise.
you've come to apologize.
I'm impressed.
I talked to my friend in San Francisco.
rumor has it, you had elson in the palm of your hand.
but your undercover got made, and elson took off.
pretty embarrassing, huh?
you said this was business.
but it's not. It's personal.
for you.
your point? I don't like hypocrites.
I don't care what you like.
follow my lead, or get off my case.
I need you guys to work the perimeter tonight.
I've got a meeting with Victor.
sure.
is Dean gonna be there?
I'm on my own.
okay, well, then, we'll put a wire on you.
I don't do wires.
okay, then a panic button. I'll be fine.
I want a clock on it, Alex. I got to have you in and out.
I don't need a clock.
so either we put a clock on it, or you find yourself a different backup.
all right. An hour.
she's a real cowgirl, huh?
maybe she's just good.
so, any luck with the fingerprint?
name's Phil Doyle.
born in 1964 in South Boston.
two priors -- assault and armed robbery.
doesn't sound Serbian to me.
he's a pro. So let's treat him like one.
give him the address to my old cover apartment at echo park, but I need a few days to set it up.
okay, then what?
let me know when he's coming by, and I'll take it from there.
you don't want backup?
you're a real stubborn prick sometimes.
I mean, you really think that Victor's gonna make a deal with Alex?
I don't know.
but she's a lot better than you think.
I was afraid of that.
you want me to sabotage it?
no.
she's clean.
hope you enjoyed that. Sit down.
well, I must confess, you're far more comely than I imagined.
I hear "tattoo parlor," you know, I don't
I don't think "pulchritude."
do you like wine?
sometimes.
with dinner mostly.
try this.
it's a burgundy.
but that's really just a fancy name for "pinot."
now, this one here is from a different region.
it's...
I think it's more earthy.
I'd love to, but I have another meeting.
what's the rush?
relax. Hang out.
okay, it's been an hour.
just give her a chance.
we put a clock on this.
no, you put a clock on this.
Yeah, and she agreed.
what if we bust in there and she has the whole thing under control?
you really want to blow a federal case for nothing?
10 more minutes, Jaimie. That's it.
so, I've been reading this...
this new book on Churchill.
he's a fascinating character.
are we gonna talk about business or what?
what's the harm in a little conversation?
like I said, Victor, I have another meeting.
I tell you when to leave.
go to hell. What did you say?
now it's been an hour and 10 minutes.
we haven't seen or heard anything suspicious.
I came here to talk about business,
not wine, not history.
you just keep jerking me around.
so, like I said, go to hell.
tough and gorgeous.
I like it.
I'm going in.
door.
see you tomorrow.
one more thing. What?
I don't want to deal with iggy and Dean.
they're little boys.
I want to deal with you.
you guys want to go get a drink?
hell yeah.
Absolutely.
Victor asked me about the Address, so you need to get the echo park joint set up asap.
one more thing
I think Alex's meeting with Victor is going down today.
find jimbo's address yet?
easy question, Dean.
look, Phil, I-I'm not in your line of business.
okay, so I'm -- I'm just a little gun-shy about all this.
Victor told me to get the address...
or kill you instead.
I'll ask one more time.
but before you answer, know this.
if you say anything other than "yes,"
I'm gonna shoot you in the face.
Yes.
good answer.
he lives in Venice on rose.
Oh, no.
you're taking me there.
where are you going?
I thought you might need some help.
I don't.
look, man, this thing goes sideways.
stay here, and keep your mouth shut.
come on. Come on.
come on, Carter. Pick up.
come on, Carter. Pick up!
how's it goin'?
thank God for handcuffs, huh?
truth is, if it wasn't for this slightly insane colombian broad,
I probably wouldn't have 'em.
now, look, Phil.
I know you clipped Freddy.
and I know Victor hired you to whack me.
so the obvious thing to do here is to shoot you in the head.
but I'll be honest with you.
I don't want to do that.
it's a hassle.
I mean, I got to chop up your body.
I got to move the body.
I got to clean up my living room.
but if I don't do you, you'll come back tomorrow and do me.
so you see my dilemma?
I don't want to kill you...
but I have to.
unless, Phil, we can figure something out.
like what?
instead of me killing you, how about I pay you...
to kill Victor?
done.
well, how do I know you're any good at this?
I know what I'm doing.
if you knew what you were doing, I'd be dead.
how many people you kill?
plenty.
that's not a number.
five.
including Freddy? Yeah.
all on Victor's nickel?
correct.
I know it takes time to work out an immunity deal, but three days is too long.
Victor needs to be on the street in 24 hours.
that was the deal!
take it easy. We'll work it out.
I've been chasing this prick too long to have some preppy U. S.
Hello?
good. See you then.
Victor will be here in 30 minutes.
Carter, it's me.
Yeah. I got it.
all right. See you soon.
okay, I'll be right back.
where are you going? To arrest Victor.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot to tell you. I'm a cop.
wearing a wire, too.
LAPD will be here in about 2 minutes.
make yourself at home.
and did I mention that Freddy was a friend of mine?
you heard of this magazine the new yorker?
everyone says how great it is, but I don't know, I don't see.
but the articles are just too damn long.
what the hell is this? You're under arrest.
you're not a cop. I'll take that as a compliment.
go ahead. Reach for your gun.
do it.
do me a favor.
cuff him.
you're under arrest...
for the murder of Frederick James.
I hope you rot.
go!
move.
are you crazy?
I said back off the murder case!
and I said go to hell.
like I told you, elson's a person of extreme interest to the bureau.
and to you.
I know, you explained all that.
the problem is, your fancy plan made no sense.
excuse me?
your target? Elson? He's dead.
Victor had him killed two months ago.
his body's at the bottom of a quarry in palmdale.
who the hell told you this? The guy who killed him.
his name's Phil. Not a bad guy for a hit man.
and you believe him?
LAPD already found a body, so, yeah.
I do believe him.
that means you've been chasing a ghost.
agent Rice.
Yeah. Right away.
my boss just flew in from San Francisco.
wants to know what the hell happened today.
what happened is pretty simple.
in the course of your investigation, you realized that elson was dead.
you're willing to do that?
it's what happened.
thanks for looking out. I know it wasn't easy.
to Freddy, brother.
and to special Agent Alex Rice...
and her lust for chasing dead guys.
admit it. You're gonna miss me.
thought you already left.
tomorrow, 10: 05.
do you want to give me a lift to the airport?
can't believe you actually came.
Yeah, neither can I.
another round? You buying?
cool.
for the record, I usually investigate living criminals.
it's definitely been interesting being here.
interesting. Wow. Yeah.
uh, I gotta get going, so...
thanks for helping out with my boss.
I appreciate it.
how about one more drink?
okay.
when?
I appreciate that, but I was hoping to get back to San Francisco.
happy to help out.
right.
what was that about?
I'm...Staying in L. A.
Uh...They want to...
roll your unit into a joint fbi/lapd task force.
and let me guess.
you're in charge.
where are you going?
be right back.
you are confused, aren't you? Frightened.
that's all right. I can help you.
who is this?
I am a doctor. Now, you must listen to me.
you have lost your memory. There was an experiment.
something went wrong. Your memory was erased.
do you understand me?
no, Idon't understand. What the hell is going on here?
just listen. There are people coming for you even as we speak.
you must not let them find you. You must leave now.
Hello? Are you there?
Hey, Mr. Murdoch. The Automat called.
said you left your wallet there.
I suggest you retrieve it since you only paid for 3 weeks...
and they was up 10 minutes ago.
I've been here 3 weeks?
it's right there in black and white, Mr. Murdoch.
day and date.
we make our books like we make our beds, all neat and tidy.
I'll take care of it when I get back.
see that you do. Only thing makes you a guest...
in this joint, pal, is cash on the barrelhead.
house rules. 3 weeks is 3 weeks.
no days off for good behavior.
Mr. Murdoch, yes, where is he?
he just left not 5 minutes ago.
sleep now.
Hey, sweetie!
he said he was your husband's doctor.
he wanted to speak with you.
excuse me.
Dr. Sh
Schreber. Please, won't you come in?
you must be Emma Murdoch.
thank you for coming to see me on such short notice.
what is this?
a rather crude experiment... designed to further my studies.
I don't understand.
you say you're my husband's doctor, but he never mentioned you to me.
the truth is, Mrs. Murdoch...
John has been coming to see me for quite some time.
he had been grappling with feelings of betrayal...
stemming from your marital difficulties.
John told you what happened? - Yes.
when was the last time that you saw him?
3 weeks ago.
he packed a suitcase. He was very angry at me.
I understand how difficult this must be for you.
but for John's sake, l would like you...
to think of me as your friend, Emma.
it appears that John has suffered a psychotic break.
complete memory loss.
he may be delusional.
even violent.
Emma...
if he were to contact you, and l suspect he will...
you must call me immediately. Do you understand?
it is imperative that l be the first one to reach him.
wherever your husband is, he is searching...
...for himself.
good evening, Mr. Murdoch.
it is Mr. Murdoch, isn't it?
Mr.-- was it " J " -- something-- Murdoch?
J. Murdoch.
what's your name? Justin? Jerry?
no.
my name's Jason Murdoch. John Murdoch.
Jake Murdoch. How's it going?
Hi. Jack Murdoch.
Bumstead.
I told the guy, " Cash on the barrelhead. "
I said, " Listen, 3 weeks is 3 weeks. "
Where's our lucky winner?
upstairs, sir, room 614.
another call girl.
"J. Murdoch."
evening, Husselbeck.
lnspector Bumstead.
your lace is untied.
sir.
am I glad you're here, sir.
they say Detective Walenski's got the heebie-jeebies.
just take what they give me, Husselbeck.
Wow. Looks like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
hello. - Oh, it's you.
you left your wallet here, buddy.
when did I do that?
when you was last here.
when was that? - When you left your wallet.
you expect me to remember?
hello. Excuse me.
no, no, seriously.
alleged?
where you headed, chief? - Home.
and where's home?
haven't you mugs got anything better to do?
well, I'm just trying to do my job, May.
there's a killer out there in case you hadn't noticed.
maybe you should be out looking for him instead of cooling your heels, huh?
go on, get out of here.
come on.
round and round she goes.
where she stops? Nobody knows.
what's that make so far, Husselbeck? 6 hookers in all?
I believe so, sir.
give the man an " A " for effort.
you'd think these stiffs would have the good grace...
to expire at a good time of night.
Hey, too bad about Walenski, huh?
I guess he'd seen enough.
so, Husselbeck...
what kind of killer do you think stops to save a dying fish?
you've got me, sir.
Bumstead, what took you?
this killer's been running circles around us thanks to Walenski.
with all due respect, Chief lnspector...
I've known Eddie a long time. He's a good cop.
whatever kind of cop Walenski once was, he let drift a long time ago.
let me talk to Bumstead!
come on, let's go.
hold on!
Frank, Frank!
get his arm!
they're watching us!
on your feet.
there's no way out!
don't make us hurt you.
God, can't you see?!
let me go, let me go!
I'm not gonna hurt you. l'm not
what was that? - Walenski.
I'm being punished for my sins, right?
what did l ever do to inherit this?
where do you begin?
well, everything Detective Walenski committed to paper should be here, so
the only thing that should be committed is Walenski.
nothing like a little healthy paranoia.
sir, we just got the fingerprint results in.
what is this, some kind of joke?
don't throw anything away.
I came here to file a missing persons report for my husband.
take it to the front desk.
they told me to come see you.
his name's John Murdoch.
Mrs. Murdoch, why didn't you report this before?
I mean, if your husband has been missing as long as you say...
I thought he'd simply walked out on me.
then a...doctor contacted me this evening.
how long have you been married?
nearly four years.
why do you ask?
because you seem uncomfortable with your ring.
as if you were... unaccustomed to wearing it.
no, I never take it off.
do these names mean anything to you?
no. Who are these women?
why are you looking for my husband?
are you going to accuse him of something?
maybe. Maybe murder.
whose murder?
which one? - All of them.
Mrs. Murdoch, l am sorry, l'm sorry.
I didn't mean to alarm you.
I'm so sorry that l came. Just both made a mistake.
Mrs. Murdoch, if you please.
if you'll just give me half a second to explain,
I'll be right out.
have we met before?
lf we did... I hope you're still breathing.
what's your name, honey?
John.
well, that's an appropriate name.
I was just thinking.
what you do...
seems kind of dangerous...
right now.
I mean, how do you know l'm not the killer?
you don't seem like the killer type. Why?
you feeling any urges l should know about?
Aw, shoot.
so it seems you've discovered your unpleasant nature.
who are you?
we might ask the same question, yes?
sleep now.
he can tune.
what is to be done? This man is dangerous.
it is said he is able to tune.
impossible.
we have seen it with our own eyes.
on occasion the imprinting does not take.
they behave erratically when they awaken.
we find them wandering like lost children.
but this one was different, yes?
what has the doctor to say about this?
he has failed to report in.
and Mr. Quick? - No more Mr. Quick.
Mr. Quick, dead, yes.
poor, poor Mr. Quick.
Mr. Book, does he know?
should we not know, Mr. Hand?
we had hoped to learn more before sharing with you.
we can know nothing until we possess him.
Mr. Night, you will take the East.
Mr. Face, you the West.
Mr. Glove, the South.
Mr. Shade, the North.
we must have this man.
do you really think my husband could be capable of committing those murders?
do you?
let's hope, for both our sakes, that l'm wrong.
John.
I've been so worried about you.
are you punishing me?
you know, if disappearing is your way of punishing me...
I don't appreciate it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I found these keys in my pocket...
so I assume I live here.
you supposed to be my wife?
supposed to be?
John.
you really...
don't know who l am, do you?
your doctor called me.
he was worried that this might happen.
my doctor?
Yeah. He...
he gave me his card.
he's desperate to find you.
Schreber.
I feel like l'm living out someone else's nightmare.
what happened to me? Why was l seeing a doctor?
I had an affair.
you were angry at me.
the police are looking for you.
I know. I saw the papers.
killer stalks city streetwalkers. "
I was with one of those women...
before l came here tonight.
I don't understand.
I met her outside an Automat.
I guess l wanted to test myself.
I wanted to know if I had it in me to do those things.
maybe l have lost my mind, but whoever l am, l'm still me and l'm not a killer.
I believe you.
you do?
what?
the car outside, the one you arrived in.
it's a cop. He dropped me off here.
I didn't know he was still here.
John.
hold it right there, mister!
wait. You have the wrong man.
stand aside, will you, please?
I didn't kill anyone.
right now what you are is a suspect. Turn yourself in.
I'll listen to whatever you have to say.
you're not gonna believe what I have to say.
try me.
there's someone after me.
there's this group of men. They want me dead.
and I don't even know if-- They're not even
Yeah, who's gonna listen to a madman?
stand aside, Mrs. Murdoch.
run!
no one ever listens to me.
murdoch, stop!
Murdoch!
how much further?
we're almost there, buddy.
Hey, you happen to know the way to Shell Beach?
you're kidding. Me and the missus spent our honeymoon there.
all you gotta do is take Main Street west to
or is it the cross
you know, that's funny. I can't seem to remember...
if it's Main Street west or the cross-town.
I'm sorry, lnspector, I cannot be of more assistance...
but I am running late for an appointment.
well, I appreciate your taking the time.
there's just one thing that puzzles me.
l've met quite a few murderers in the course of my work.
murdoch doesn't strike me as one.
perhaps you are not accustomed to digging deep enough.
well, I do know when someone is lying to me, Doctor.
forgive me, lnspector, but you are not a clinician.
judging personalities happens to be my business.
well, maybe you could give me a few pointers.
certainly.
let's take you, for instance.
you are a fastidious man, driven.
consumed by details.
I would say your life is...
rather lonely.
good evening, lnspector. l really must be going.
closing time. The pool is now closed.
Dr. Schreber.
most unfortunate it is that we were forced to seek you out here.
you know how uncomfortable we find all this...
moisture.
I'm sorry. I-- - Failed to report in, yes.
I was frightened. I have a weak heart, you know.
your weakness is not, we think, an affair of the heart.
we found this in his hotel room.
must we reproduce Mr. Murdoch's memories again?
I tried to imprint him...
but he woke up, he knocked the syringe right out of my hand.
I tried to stop him but he was too fast.
he has no memories, then?
only fragments. The procedure, it was interrupted.
I guess it's only a matter of rounding him up.
you have had strays before, right?
this is no stray, Doctor. This one can tune.
but that's impossible.I thought only you had that ability.
you will process another template of the subject's memories, yes?
of course. I'll imprint him again.
no. We require them for a quite different purpose.
it's almost midnight, Dr. Schreber.
we'll talk again after tonight's tuning, but...
no more delays, yes?
no more inconsistencies in your behavior.
you appear quite frail, Doctor.
perhaps some exercise would do you good.
come in. - Kate.
how is he? - The same.
Walenski? lt's me, Frank.
come in, Frank.
close the door.
I've been looking through some of your old reports.
it's an interesting case.
the kind that can make a man's career...
or break it.
Yeah, I was on that case.
and then what? What happened then, Eddie?
nothing happened, Frank.
I've just been spending time on the subway, riding in circles.
thinking in circles.
there's no way out.
I've been over every inch of this city.
you're scaring your wife to death, Eddie.
she's not my wife.
I don't know who she is. l don't know who any of us are.
what makes you say that?
do you think about the past much, Frank?
as much as the next guy.
see, I've been trying to remember things
clearly remember things from my past.
but the more l try to think back, the more it all starts to unravel.
none of it seems real.
it's like l've just been dreaming this life...
and when l finally wake up l'll be somebody else.
somebody totally different.
you saw something, didn't you, Eddie?
something to do with the case.
there is no case. There never was!
it's all just a big joke! lt's a joke!
tonight's requirements are...
1 2 family photo albums, 9 personal diaries...
17 love letters, assorted childhood photographs...
26 wallets, lD's and social security cards.
these do bring back memories.
this one is still warm.
what is it?
the recollections of a great lover?
a catalog of conquests?
we will soon find out.
you wouldn't appreciate that, would you, Mr. Whatever your name is?
not the sort of conquests you would ever understand.
let's see.
a touch of unhappy childhood.
a dash of teenage rebellion.
and last, but not least...
a tragic death in the family.
doctor.
Mr. Book.
why does Murdoch not sleep...
during the tuning as the others do?
I don't know. Maybe he's a step up the evolutionary ladder.
a freak of nature. He's adapting to survive.
what do you expect? Weren't you looking for the human soul?
that's the purpose of your little zoo, isn't it?
that's why you keep changing people and things around every night.
maybe you have finally found what you are looking for...
and it's going to bite you on your
it requires several of your lifetimes to master our gifts.
the idea that a simple man could develop the ability to tune.
is absurd, I know...
but what other explanation is there?
it is time.
shut it down.
get your paper right here!
it's driving me crazy.
I can't sleep.
and they call my job " unskilled " .
you think you've got it tough?
you try looking after these kids, for a change.
anyways, Frederickson says he'll take me off the damn night shift soon.
well, it's about time, dear.
Hello?
wake up!
Hey!
wake up!
wake up!
wake up!
can anybody hear me?!
let the tuning commence.
the Goodwins. Jeremy, Sylvia...
Jane and little Matthew.
Jane and little Matthew.
the rich get richer.
probably have maid's quarters before the night is through.
Dr. Schreber, I presume.
it's you.
Hey, come on.
that's no way to greet a patient, Doctor.
if that's what you are, huh, Doctor?
Mr. Murdoch, please, l
what is happening here? Why is everyone asleep?
Shh. Please keep your voice down.
why can't I remember anything? What have you done to me?
nothing, nothing. Please, l want to help you.
we can't talk here.
it is not safe. lf they see us together, they'll
I don't care. I want some answers.
I want some answers now!
who are they?
why are they trying to kill me?
answer me!
my God. You really can do it.
I did that?
listen to me, John. You have their power.
you can make things happen by will alone.
they call it tuning. That is how they make the buildings change.
just now you acted out of self-defense. A reflex.
but I can teach you to control your power consciously.
let me help you, John. Together we can stop them.
we can take the city back.
my glasses.
my glasses, please.
he made a terrible impression for the firm...
lollygagging around as he did.
so I simply told Frederickson I was going to have to let him go.
and well you should have, darling.
he attacked me.
I don't know where he has gone.
come, Dr. Schreber.
we have much to do.
yes?
Yes.
tonight's experiment shall be conducted in the following locations.
the first subject shall be imprinted here on Avenue M.
Mr. Book. There is a problem.
there is no Avenue M. We were unable to complete it.
during the last tuning we detected a lack of control.
an opposing influence on the machines?
then this man Murdoch is more powerful than we thought.
he's becoming like us.
so we must become like him.
the good doctor has done as we asked?
the life and times of John Murdoch, Volume 2.
we must not do this.
murdoch does not possess these memories, yes?
how will his imprint allow us to find him?
everywhere he goes...
everyone he seeks out will be known to us.
and as he follows the clues, so shall we follow the memories.
perhaps we have forgotten what happened last time, when we t
Yes. Poor, poor Mr.
we have not forgotten.
if Mr. Hand wishes to make this sacrifice for the greater good...
so be it.
but to imprint one of us. Failure has always resulted.
what Mr. Hand proposes is our only option.
imprint.
this may sting a bit.
lollygaggings it done?
Oh, yes, Mr. Book.
I have John Murdoch...in mind.
Johnny...
I found this postcard among your mother's things.
'Brings back memories, doesn't it?
stop by sometime.
we'll see if we can't hook ourselves...
'another mermaid.
love to Emma. Karl.
Karl.
Karl Harris.
Harris.
Harris.
'Harris Karl. "
excuse me. Can you tell me the way to Avenue C?
try the subway.
you got a problem, pal?
you been working here long?
25 years. No days off for good behavior.
we're looking for John Murdoch.
she knows nothing, Mr. Hand.
a dead end, yes, Mr. Wall.
we thought his imprint would allow us to track him, yes...
but instead we have been brought here.
this is irrational.
instincts are irrational, Mr. Wall...
and we must follow where they lead, yes.
Mr. Sleep suggests he may go to places familiar...his job.
he does not care about our job.
indulge us, Mr. Hand.
if you were Murdoch
Yes.
lollygaggingf...
I were Murdoch...
I would remember...
how my wife had hurt me by sleeping with another man.
and then...
I would look for a way to hurt her in return.
leave me alone with her.
there's work to be done.
all change, platform 3.
platform 3, all change.
all change? Excuse me.
how do I get to the end of the line?
you want the Express.
no trains leave on platform 7.
you want platform 2. - Got it. Thanks a lot.
Hey!
how come that train didn't stop?
that's the Express.
there's no way out, you know?
you can't get out of the city. Believe me, l've tried.
you're Murdoch, aren't you?
the one they've been looking for.
who are you? - Used to be a cop.
at least, in this life, I was.
they steal people's memories, you know?
then they swap them around between us.
I've seen them do it. Back and forth, back and forth...
till no one knows who they are anymore.
how do you know all this?
once in a while, one of us wakes up while they're changing things.
it's not supposed to happen, but it does.
it happened to me.
they'll come looking for you, Murdoch.
just like they'll come looking for me.
but that's OK.
I figured a way out.
they were here.
last night.
this was to be his home.
that was when we loved her.
this is all well and good, Mr. Hand...
but we require a more practical link to his present whereabouts.
Yes.
and I know where to find her.
we're very lucky, when you think about it.
I'm sorry?
to be able to revisit those places which have meant so very much to us.
I thought it was more that we were haunted by them.
perhaps.
but imagine a life...
alien to yours...
in which your memories were not your own...
but those shared by every other of your kind.
imagine the torment of such an existence...
no experiences to call your own.
if it was all you knew...
maybe it would be a comfort.
but if you were to discover something different...
Something...better.
there used to be a ferry when I was a boy.
biggest thing you ever saw.
lit up like a floating birthday cake.
that's just what my husband once said to me...
on this very spot.
where is your husband now?
I wish l knew. What brings you here?
I met my wife at this place.
it's where l first met my husband.
small world.
no, no, no.
Hello?
Hello?
what are you doing here?
I've been following you.
hold it right there!
lt's been so damn long...
I thought you'd forgotten your Uncle Karl.
you son of a gun!
uncle Karl?
wait.
is that me?
Yeah.
shell Beach is where I grew up?
that's what I said.
shell Beach, your hometown.
I need to get there, Karl. How do l get there?
I don't know.
I haven't been there in years. - Come on. You must remember.
you gotta have some idea.
come on!
sorry, Johnny.
the old cracker barrel ain't what it used to be.
so bright there.
brighter times,I guess.
you were always scribbling in that damn book.
that's me and your pa.
what a couple of handsome fools.
what happened to my parents?
where are they now?
they're dead, Johnny.
they died when their house burnt down.
I looked after you.
you don't remember that, really?
what's that?
what is that?
it's a scar.
you burnt your arm pretty bad in the fire.
what does it mean, Johnny? - lt means these are all lies!
why are you here, Mrs. Murdoch?
my husband told me he'd been here.
he told me he wanted to test himself...
see if he was...
capable of
I wanted to talk to her. l thought maybe she could help me find him.
stay here. l'm gonna call the station.
Yeah, this is Bumstead. Send the homicide coroner to 1440-- East, yeah.
there's been another one.
it's the same pattern. l'll explain when you get here.
Oh, God.
it's OK. I won't hurt you.
it's OK.
where the hell did she come from?
I found her hiding.
she saw what happened here.
are you ready to go home, Mrs. Murdoch?
the inspector is gonna take me. Thanks.
it's beautiful.
it was a gift from my mother.
she died recently.
I keep it with me to remind me of her.
I'm sorry.
it's a funny thing, though.
I can't remember when she gave it to me.
how do you think I could forget a thing like that?
do you think about the past much, Mrs. Murdoch?
what's happening, lnspector?
I'm not sure I know anymore.
l left your old room like it was.
you can sleep here tonight, huh?
glad to have you back, Johnny...
even if it is for just a night.
Karl.
ls that the right time?
why, sure. That clock's kept perfect time since l bought it.
A. m. or p. m?
what do you think, Johnny?
I don't understand. How can it be night already?
what happened to the day? How'd I miss it?
you're tired. Anything's possible.
look...
get some sleep. We'll straighten all this out tomorrow.
guide to Shell Beach by Johnny Murdoch.
Oh, come on.
Hello? - Emma, he's here.
he's acting mighty peculiar.
I know. He's not himself.
keep him there, and l'll be right over.
I'll try. - Thanks, Karl. Bye.
I can't promise anything, Mrs. Murdoch.
we just have to play it as it comes.
Johnny, we just wanted to help.
Karl.
uncle Karl.
Johnny, if you're in some kind of trouble... well, maybe we could do something.
haven't seen you in so long.
Yes.
Mr. Murdoch...you've been the cause of much distress.
start talking. - There's no need for this.
there's no escape.
the city's ours. We made it.
what are you talking about?
we fashioned this city on stolen memories...
different eras, different pasts all rolled into one.
each night, we revise it, refine it...
in order to learn.
learn what?
about you, Mr. Murdoch...
you and your fellow inhabitants...
what makes you human.
Why?! - We need to be like you.
I understand you now, Mr. Murdoch.
I remember that which you do not... what you've been missing.
the ocean, yes...
running along the waves as a child...
meeting Emma at the river... That first kiss that followed.
what are you?
you've seen what we are.
we use your dead as vessels.
get in!
what about her? Ring any bells?
she was alive when l left her.
what about this?
this is nothing. This is
it must mean something, all those pictures.
what pictures?
I don't understand this.
stop playing games with me, Murdoch! Stop telling me lies!
I am not telling you lies!
help me out here. Make me understand.
I have this jigsaw puzzle in front of my face...
and every time I try to rearrange the pieces, it still doesn't make any sense.
you think it makes sense to me?
I'm as much in the dark here as you are.
you let me ask you a question?
you heard of a place called Shell Beach?
sure. - You know how to get there?
Yeah. - You tell me?
all right. You just-- You go to the...
where? Where do you go?
just give me a second, will ya?
you can't remember, can you?
you think that's kind of odd?
wait.
I got a better one for you.
when was the last time...
you remember doing something during the day?
what do you mean?
I just mean...during the day.
daylight.
when was the last time you remember seeing it?
and I'm not talking about some distant, half-forgotten childhood memory.
I mean like yesterday? Last week? When?
can you come up with a single memory?
you can't, can you?
you know something? l don't think the sun even...
exists...in this place.
cause l've been up for hours and hours and hours and the night never ends here.
that is crazy. - You're damn right this is crazy.
listen to me, Bumstead. It's not just me.
it's all of us.
they're doing something to all of us.
shut up, I've heard enough. - Please listen.
shut up, will ya! Shut up! - Listen to me.
there has to be an explanation for this somewhere.
explain this.
John, I'm so sorry.
I never meant to hurt you, John...
and I did it, and l don't know why l did.
I wish I could take it all back.
no. Emma... You didn't do it.
This...affair of yours, whatever it is...
the thing you're supposed to have done...
you didn't do it. I don't believe it ever happened.
what do you mean?
I know this is gonna sound crazy...
but what if we never knew each other before now?
what if the first time we ever met...
was last night in your-- in our apartment...
and everything you remember...
and everything that I'm supposed to remember never really happened?
someone just wants us to think it did.
you know, back in the apartment...
I suddenly felt like l didn't know you at all.
it was as if you were a stranger.
but how can that be true?
I so vividly remember meeting you.
I remember falling in love with you.
I remember losing you.
time's up.
no, wait, wait.
please, just...
just one more minute.
I love you, John.
you can't fake something like that.
no, you can't.
inspector? Sir?
detective Walenski killed himself last night.
I...kind of thought you should know.
Oh, and... the chief wanted to see you.
sir...
I knew you'd track the killer down, sir.
sir...
shoelace.
how can we help you, sir?
you can sleep.
gentlemen
sleep. Sleep.
evening, sir.
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you...about the case.
take us to Murdoch.
sleep.
Dr. Schreber.
I knew you'd come eventually.
don't you think it's about time you started giving me some answers?
Yes. Yes, of course.
won't you please sit down?
I come here quite often.
it's one of the few places l'm allowed a moment's peace.
you see, they have an aversion to water.
one could almost call it a phobia.
who are they? What do they want from me?
right.
well, for now, let's just say...
that you were the subject of their experiment.
we all are.
you're not crazy, John.
and you are not a murderer.
I'm sorry about this. I truly am.
but we do not have much time...
and I cannot afford the luxury of doing this the right way.
everything you need to know...
all the answers are in this syringe.
I need you to inject yourself.
it's the only way to make you understand.
you're kidding me, right?
we're running out of time, John. You have to do this now.
give me the gun, Doctor.
lnspector, he is more disturbed than we thought.
I may not be the judge of personality that you are, Doctor...
but you're the one who looks disturbed to me.
you do not know what you are doing.
what, exactly is in this...Doctor?
all the answers you've been looking for, John.
I swear to you.
guess I'll just have to hold on to it for...safekeeping.
lf you don't mind.
let's go, Doctor.
go? Where are we going? - Shell Beach.
that's where you want to go, isn't it?
the ocean.
why are you doing this?
what do you hope to gain by helping me?
the truth.
none of these maps extend far enough to show the ocean.
you won't find anything there...
I promise you! I've been there, and
lf you've been there, you can show us the way, then, can't you?
we'll see for ourselves.
I won't.
I refuse. You can't make me go there!
you were saying, doctor?
I don't understand. Used to be a bridge here.
try that again, your friends are gonna be...
fishing you out of the canal.
just don't hurt me. I'll tell you everything.
it doesn't matter anymore anyway.
what?
who are you people?
we will give you some more pretty things soon...Anna.
I'm not Anna.
you will be soon, yes.
I have another use for her first.
first there was darkness. Then came the strangers.
they abducted us and brought us here.
this city, everyone in it...
is their experiment.
they mix and match our memories as they see fit...
trying to divine what makes us unique.
one day, a man might be an inspector.
the next, someone entirely different.
when they want to study a murderer for instance...
they simply imprint one of their citizens with a new personality...
arrange a family for him, friends, an entire history...
even a lost wallet.
then they observe the results.
will a man, given the history of a killer, continue in that vein?
or are we, in fact, more than the mere sum of our memories?
this business of you being a killer was an unhappy coincidence.
you have had dozens of lives before now.
you just happened to wake up while I was imprinting you with this one.
why are they doing all of this?
it is our capacity for individuality...
our souls that makes us different from them.
they think they can find the human soul...
if they understand how our memories work.
all they have are collective memories.
they share one group mind.
they're dying, you see?
their entire race is on the brink of extinction.
they think we can save them.
where do I fit in? - You are different, John.
you resisted my attempt to imprint you.
somehow you have developed their ability to tune.
that is how they change things.
that is how they built this city.
they have machines buried deep beneath the surface...
that allow them to focus their telepathic energies.
they control everything here, even the sun.
that's why it's always dark. They can't stand the light.
so why do they need you?
when they first brought us here, they extracted what was in us.
so they could store the information, remix it like so much paint...
and give us back new memories of their choosing.
but they still needed an artist to help them.
I understood the intricacies of the human mind...
better than they ever could...
so they allowed me to keep my skills as a scientist...
because they needed them.
but they made me delete everything else.
can you imagine what it is like being forced...
to erase your own past?
what about my past? What about my childhood?
shell Beach, Uncle Karl.
what about this?
this was blank when I found it!
you still don't understand, John.
you were never a boy... not in this place.
your entire history is an illusion, a fabrication...
as it is with all of us.
you made those drawings happen with your gift.
you say they brought us here.
from where?
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.
none of us remember that...
what we once were...
what we might have been...
somewhere else.
I've taken you this far.
you don't need me anymore.
let's go.
there is no ocean, John.
there is nothing beyond the city.
the only place home exists...
is in your head.
No! No!
John, stop!
No!
stop!
please!
No!
and now you know the truth.
No!
you'll allow yourself to surrender, Mr. Murdoch...
or it will result in this one's death, yes?
what do I care? She's not my real wife!
she's nothing to me!
but you do still care, don't you, Mr. Murdoch?
you see,I have become the monster...
you were intended to be.
shall I end her life now as you would have?
don't hurt her, please!
then surrender, Mr. Murdoch.
sleep.
now.
sleep.
the doctor was right. He has evolved.
kill him.
kill him! Kill him!
kill him! Kill him!
he is powerful, yes.
dangerous. But he can also lead us to what we seek.
what the doctor calls the soul.
it is time for our experiment to move into a final phase.
we no longer need the other subjects.
the time for study is over.
it is time to be one with John Murdoch.
it is time, Doctor.
imprint.
shut it down!
shut it down forever!
what are you doing?
they want to imprint you with their own collective memories.
they want to make you one of them, so they can share your soul.
imprint, Doctor. No more disobedience.
I'm sorry, John.
the pain will only last a moment.
No!
remember, John.
you'll rise to greater heights than that, my boy.
one day when you're older, you'll understand.
remember.
that's it, John. Practice makes perfect.
now remember what l told you. Never talk to strangers.
John, remember.
you're probably wondering why l keep appearing in your memories.
it is because l have inserted myself in them.
all of these memories have been fabricated...
to teach you about the strangers.
give you a lifetime of knowledge in a single syringe.
you will survive, John.
you will find strength within yourself...
and you will prevail.
remember.
Hi, Uncle Karl.
you're getting the hang of it, John.
maybe one day I'll be working for you.
this is the machine the strangers use to amplify their thoughts.
the machine that changes their world.
you must take control of it.
you must make the machine yours.
I know you can beat them, John.
but you must concentrate.
something's wrong.
there is no time for romance, John.
the world can be what you make it.
what have you done?
you have the power to make anything happen...
but you must act now!
I knew you could do it, John.
you have their power now.
you control their machines.
Where's Emma?
she is not Emma anymore, John.
she has been reimprinted.
so give her back her memories.
I can't. The facility where the strangers...
stored the memories has been destroyed.
I'm sorry.
what are you going to do now, John?
you told me I had the power, didn't you?
I can make these machines do anything l want.
make this world anything l want it to be.
just so long as I concentrate hard enough.
where are you going?
shell Beach.
what's the fare? - Quarter.
Oh, please.
Oh, no- lt's fine.
thank you. - OK.
been waiting for you, yes?
what are you doing?
I'm just making a few little changes around here, is all.
are we sure that's what we want?
I'm prepared to take my chances.
I'm dying, John.
your imprint is not agreeable with my kind.
but I wanted to know what it was like...
how you feel.
you know how I was supposed to feel.
that person isn't me. Never was.
you wanted to know what it was about us that made us human.
well, you're not going to find it...in here.
you went looking in the wrong place.
it's so beautiful here.
so bright.
do you know if Shell Beach is around here?
I think that's it just over there.
I'm headed that way myself.
would you like to join me?
sure.
I'm Anna, by the way.
what's your name? - John.
John Murdoch.
I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial.
this is crazy. What did I do?
I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me.
what, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
we can talk, sir.
Oh, I see. So it's personal? - No, you intimidate them.
good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first. - I'm an airman.
you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there.
I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now.
is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.
sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please.
is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
that is an excellent question. Yes and no.
march and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins.
anything else? You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
is it cool if I take a picture with you? - Yes. It's very cool.
all right.
I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.
please, no gang signs.
no, throw it up. I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings.
what's going on? - Contact left!
what have we got?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
stay down! - Yeah.
son of a bitch!
wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun! - Stay here!

as liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot,
he is my friend and he is my great mentor,
ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr, Tony Stark, - Thank you, Colonel. - Thanks for the save.
this is beautiful, Thank you, Thank you all very much,
this is wonderful,
well, I'm not Tony Stark,
but if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award,
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony is also the worst thing,
he's always working,
work it! Come on!
we should just stay till the morning. - You are unbelievable.
Oh, no! Did they rope you into this? - Nobody roped me into anything!
I'm so sorry. - But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.
of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great.
so when do we do it? - It's right here.
here you go. - There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's okay.
I don't have any of those floating around.
we're gonna let it ride!
give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.
okay, you, too.
I don't blow on a man's dice. - Come on, honey bear.
there it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
two craps. Line away.
that's what happens. - Worse things have happened.
I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, William.
this is where I exit. - All right.
tomorrow, don't be late.
Yeah, you can count on it. - I'm serious!
I know, I know.

Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine.
can I ask you a couple of questions?
she's cute. - She's all right?
Hi. - Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go. - It's okay?
you've been called the da Vinci of our time.
what do you say to that? - Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
and what do you say to your other nickname?
the Merchant of Death?
that's not bad.
let me guess. Berkeley? - Brown, actually.
well, Ms. Brown, it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace,
I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
rehearse that much?
every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
I can see that. - I'd like to show you first-hand.
all I want is a serious answer.
okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."
that's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.
my father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project.
a lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
and a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.
tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?
all those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
you ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
good morning, It's 7: 00 a, m,
the weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds,
the surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines,
high tide will be at 10: 52 a, m,
Hey, Tony?
you are not authorized to access this area, - Jesus. - That's Jarvis. He runs the house.
I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.
you must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
after all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.
I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash.
will that be all?
give me an exploded view.
the compression in cylinder three appears to be low,
log that.
I'm gonna try again, right now. - Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
you are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.
how'd she take it? - Like a champ.
why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
that's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.
Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.
doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.
do you want it? Yes or no.
is it a good representation of his spring period?
no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked, - not "spring" like the season. - So?
I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it. Store it.
okay. The MIT commencement speech...
is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...
they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.
deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
what are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?
as a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
it's your birthday? - Yes.
I knew that. Already?
Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.
And? - It was very nice.
Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
you're welcome, Miss Potts.
okay.
you're good. I thought I lost you back there.
you did, sir. I had to cut across Mulholland.
I got you. I got you.
what's wrong with you?
what? - Three hours.
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair,
for three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.
waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.
wheels up! Rock and roll!
what you reading, platypus? - Nothing.
come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.
I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?
I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark.
you don't need to apologize to me. I'm your man.
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...
I'm just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?
you don't respect yourself, - so I know you don't respect me. - I respect you.
I'm just your babysitter.
so, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.
let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?
thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking...
we're not drinking. We're working right now.
you can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.
it would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
hot sake?
Yes, two, please. - No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
that's what I'm talking about.
when I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...
no, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are.
can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!
general.
welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.
Thanks.
is it better to be feared or respected?
I say, is it too much to ask for both?
with that in mind, I humbly present the 'crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.
it's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.
they say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.
that's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.
and it's worked out pretty well so far.
find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.
for your consideration, the Jericho.
I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more.
to peace!
Tony, - Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?
it went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
good night, Tony, - Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."
the "hum-drum-vee" is back there.
nice job. - See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
what the hell did you do to me?
what I did?
what I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum.
here, want to see?
I have a souvenir. Take a look.
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.
we call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.
what is this? - That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.
that's right. Smile.
we met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.
I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.
if I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.
where are we?
come on, stand up. Stand up!
just do as I do.
come on, put your hands up.
those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
do you understand me? Do as I do.
he says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer in the history of America."
he is honored.
he wants you to build the missile.
the Jericho missile that you demonstrated.
this one.
I refuse.
he wants to know what you think.
I think you got a lot of my weapons.
he says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile.
he wants you to make the list of materials.
he says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.
no, he won't. - No, he won't.
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.
but they will never find you in these mountains.
look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark.
your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.
is that how you want to go out?
is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?
or are you going to do something about it?
why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way.
and if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it?
if this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up.
I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.
I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.
how many languages do you speak? - A lot.
but apparently, not enough for this place.
they speak Arabic, Urdu,
dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.
who are these people? - They are your loyal customers, sir.
they call themselves the Ten Rings.
you know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.
okay, we don't need this.
what is that?
that's palladium, 0. 15 grams.
we need at least 1. 6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?
careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.
relax. I have steady hands.
why do you think you're still alive?
what do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, too.
that doesn't look like a Jericho missile.
that's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor.
I got a big one powering my factory at home.
it should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
but what could it generate?
if my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.
that could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
this is our ticket out of here. - What is it?
flatten them out and look.
Oh, wow.
impressive.
good.
good roll. Good roll.
you still haven't told me where you're from.
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.
it's actually a nice place. - Got a family?
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here.
and you, Stark?
no. - No?
so you're a man who has everything and nothing.
relax.
the bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology.
it allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.
an empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire.
but today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands.
and soon, it will be my turn.
what does he want?
what do you want? A delivery date?
I need him.
good assistant.
you have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.
okay? Can you move?
okay, say it again.
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.
say something. Say something back to him.
he's speaking Hungarian. I don't... - Then speak Hungarian.
okay. I know. - What do you know?
how'd that work? - Oh, my goodness.
it worked all right. - That's what I do.
let me finish this. - Initialize the power sequence.
okay.
now! - Tell me. Tell me.
function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar.
it should be up right now. - Yes.
talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
I have it. - Press Control "l."
I. Got it. - "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter.
come over here and button me up.
okay. All right.
every other hex bolt.
they're coming! - Nothing pretty, just get it done.
just get it done. - They're coming.
make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?
we need more time.
I'm gonna go buy you some time. - Stick to the plan!
stick to the plan!
Yinsen! - Watch out!
come on. We got to go.
move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.
this was always the plan, Stark.
come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up.
my family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
it's okay.
I want this. I want this.
thank you for saving me.
don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
my turn.
not bad.
Hey!
how was the "fun-vee"?
next time, you ride with me, okay?
watch it, coming up here.
are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.
your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-Iost boss?
tears of joy. I hate job hunting. - Yeah, vacation's over.
where to, sir?
take us to the hospital, please, Happy. - No.
no? Tony, you have to - go to the hospital. - No is a complete answer.
the doctor has to look at you. - I don't have to do anything.
I've been in captivity for three months.
there are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, - and the other... - That's enough of that.
...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
call for a press conference? - Yeah.
what on earth for? - Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
look at this!
we were going to meet at the hospital. - No, I'm fine.
look at you!
you had to have a burger, yeah? - Well, come on.
you get me one of those? - There's only one left. I need it.
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!
miss Potts? - Yes.
can I speak to you for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now.
I'm not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
that's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it.
you know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...
we're a separate division with a more specific focus.
we need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
I'll put something in the book, shall I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?
why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...
a little less formal and...
what's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me.
I don't know what he's up to.
good to see you. - Good to see you.
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.
I never got to say goodbye to my father.
there's questions that I would have asked him.
I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.
if he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.
or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.
and I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.
Mr. Stark! - Hey, Ben.
what happened over there?
I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up.
and that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be,
I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers,
what direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well,
what we should take away from this is that Tony's back!
and he's healthier than ever,
we're going to have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with the follow-up, - Where is he? - He's inside.
well, that... That went well.
did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
your head? What about my head?
what do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.
Yep.
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.
obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.
that's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.
it's my name on the side of the building.
and what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
not based on what I saw.
we're not doing a good enough job.
we can do better. We're gonna do something else.
like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up!
it works. - Yeah, as a science project.
the arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it.
arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?
maybe.
am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?
thirty years. - That's what they say.
could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?
never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.
I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.
okay. - Okay?
it works.
listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?
there's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?
but if I had... - Tony.
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.
you understand me? - That was Dad's line.
you gotta let me handle this.
we're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.
we're going to have to take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.
stark Industries!
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?
sell, sell, sell!
abandon ship!
does the Hindenburg ring any bells?
let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!
look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!
pepper, How big are your hands?
what? - How big are your hands?
I don't understand why... - Get down here, I need you,
Hey.
let's see them. Show me your hands.
let's see them.
Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed.
I just need your help for a sec.
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?
it was. It is now an antique.
this is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.
speed bump, what does that mean? - It's nothing. It's just a little snag.
there's an exposed wire under this device.
and it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.
it's fine.
what do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.
that is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!
I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.
is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.
it's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."
what do you mean, "Operation"? - It's just a game, never mind.
just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great. - Okay.
you know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.
no, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.
is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...
okay, okay. - I really need your help here.
okay.
Oh, there's pus!
it's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, - not from my body. - It smells!
Yeah, it does.
the copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?
okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?
now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
that's what I was trying to tell you before.
okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...
there's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.
Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...
don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?
what's wrong?
nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest 'cause you yanked it out like a trout...
what? You said it was safe! - We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.
you gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.
Tony? It's going to be okay. - What?
is it? - It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay. - Let's hope.
okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make sure you...
was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here.
nice.
are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great.
you okay?
don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
anyway...
what do you want me to do with this? - That?
destroy it.
incinerate it.
you don't want to keep it?
pepper, I've been called many things. "Nostalgic" is not one of them.
will that be all, Mr. Stark? - That will be all, Miss Potts.
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.
what's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?
that's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad.
right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.
the future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?
I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.
Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987.
that lovely lady you woke up with. - Don't do that!
what was his name? - Don't do that.
was it Ivan? - Don't do that.
they'll believe it. Don't do that.
okay. - Don't do that.
pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys.
I'm surprised. - Why?
I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little better than walking.
Really? - Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.
I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.
you're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.
this is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
what? You're a humanitarian now or something?
I need you to listen to me. - No.
what you need is time to get your mind right.
I'm serious. - Okay.
it's nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
Jarvis, you up? - For you, sir, always,
I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.
shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
actually, I don't know who to trust right now.
till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?
working on a secret project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands.
maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.
next. Up.
not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me?
stay put. Nice.
you're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this.
okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?
up.
screw it. Don't even move.
you are a tragedy.
okay, let's do this right,
start mark, half a meter, and back and center,
dummy, look alive, You're on standby for fire safety,
you, roll it.
okay, Activate hand controls,
we're gonna start off nice and easy,
we're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift,
up two. All right, set that.
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... What?
Obadiah's upstairs. - Great!
what would you like me to tell him? - Great. I'll be right up.
okay.
I thought you said you were done making weapons.
it is.
this is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
how'd it go?
it went that bad, huh?
just because I brought pizza back from New York - doesn't mean it went bad. - Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
it would have gone better if you were there.
you told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing.
I lay low, and you take care of all... - Hey, come on. In public. The press.
this was a board of directors meeting. - This was a board of directors meeting?
the board is claiming you have posttraumatic stress.
they're filing an injunction.
a what? - They want to lock you out.
why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points?
we knew that was gonna happen.
fifty-six and a half. - It doesn't matter.
we own the controlling interest in the company.
Tony, the board has rights, too.
they're making the case that you and your new direction - isn't in the company's best interest. - I'm being responsible!
that's a new direction for me, for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that...
this is great.
Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I'll be in the shop.
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.
I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something.
something to pitch them.
let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.
no. No, absolutely not. - It'll give me a bone to throw the boys - in New York! - This one stays with me.
that's it, Obie. Forget it. - All right, well, this stays with me, then.
go on, here, you can have a piece.
take two. - Thank you.
you mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?
good night, Obie.
day 11, test 37, configuration 2. 0. For lack of a better option,
dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college.
all right, nice and easy,
seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity,
Hi!
Amar sent this for you.
he has sent it for you.
somebody should love me for a moment.
even if it's fake.
Amar! See this useless TV!
you don't understand polite language.
I don't know what all things...
take your medicine on time.
and today please don't eat junk food.

Yes! What girls! It was great!

our players are in all the teams.
I don't understand whose side to take. It's so confusing.

I don't think he understood.

Yes!

this is what Dr. Khan told my husband too!
ulcer in the stomach. Here.
but after doing the test, do you know what the result was?
stomach cancer. That too second stage.
sorry to hear that.
okay, Mr. Amar, doctor is calling you inside.
no, I am just bored.
forget all that now...
my report... - Yes, your reports have arrived. It's...
you said it's ulcer.
Yes. I did say ulcer. - Yes.
Mr. Kaul, it's... a little, a little more complicated than that.
do I have stomach cancer?
Mr. Kaul, you should have come to me much earlier.
you want to have a glass of water?
please.
you mean to say I have stomach cancer?
I'm sure there is some misunderstanding, doctor.
maybe the reports got mixed up. It frequently happens.
did you double check?
how can I have stomach cancer, doctor?
I am only 37 years old.
I never smoked. I never drank.
I don't eat spicy food too, doctor.
my maid at times adds more pepper in the food.
but mama too eats it. She doesn't have any problem.
look, Mr. Kaul.
stomach cancer is frequently detected in the late stage.
many times it's detected in the 3rd stage.
and by then it's very late.
unfortunately this is what has happened in your case too.
at that stage there is very little medical science can do.
are you sure?
I am sorry, Mr. Kaul.
how much time do I have left?
the world seems forlorn, still.
my dream, so innate.
the world seems forlorn, still.
my dream, so innate.
within the shimmer of the city lies darkness.
sorrow is hidden behind every smile.
if this is true then let me live each moment to its fullest.
and smilingly I will say to sorrow.
goodbye!
goodbye!
goodbye!
goodbye!
life, don't meet me as a stranger.
life, don't meet me as a stranger.
worship is included in every prayer.
worship is included in every prayer.
life, don't meet me as a stranger.
worship is included in every prayer.
why are you woebegone?
cheer up!
do you know, you have so much work left?
cool.
so you didn't do the work I gave you yesterday.
no, right?
sir, I am not well.
look, Mr. Kaul. This is an office.
it's not a KG classroom.
that you said sir, I was not well. My stomach was paining.
so I didn't do my homework.
God!
sir, Namdev has gone to the airport to pick up your wife.
I see. Come here.
he can't do anything. He is messing up everything.
go. Handle it.
do something. - I will do something.
come.
listen! I had ordered for juice!
find out whether it has come or not.
were our problems less, Amar...
...that you have put us into more trouble?
what did boss say?
this is last year's outstanding account.
the credit list has to be checked. Got it?
that too within an hour.
his father is in Delhi. With a sword in his hand.
you have spoilt my mood.
really! Somebody makes the mistake...
...and somebody else has to pay the price!
my day is ruined!
come on! Tonight I will alleviate your sorrow with rum.
toast? - Toast.
the cure for our sorrow. Let's go there.
great!
give me my rum.
sir, the stock got over.
shall I serve you another brand? It's good.
another brand!
fool! Change your wife, your house, car...
...but never change your brand.
got it? A brand shows a person's stature.
what will you understand?
go and tell the manager that Jagtap has come.
and he has said to serve his brand from the stock at the back.
go.
I swear, sir. There was only one bottle left.
I just served it to a customer.
shall I give you a punch?
my brother's friend is an excise inspector! Got it?
I will shut down your bar!
sir! You can have mine!
I gave it to him.
why should I take it from him? He seems to be a simpleton.
leave!
come on!
I just had a pack. - Wow!
what are you looking at?
I'm looking for an 'L' board. Learner.
already you are drunk.
I'm drinking for the first time.
before dying I wanted to see what it tastes like.
if you have not drunk then you have not lived your life.
maybe that's why I am dying. - Give me ice.
I would have died if I had not got my brand.
thank you.
you seem to be the type of man who drinks when he is tense.
why are you tense?
mister, I just told you. I am going to die.
why are you harping about dying?
I am going to die. They all are going to die.
his death is written in my hands.
give me one... - Pass me the coke.
are you drinking for the first time? - Yes.
do you smoke? - I don't smoke.
girls?
once I watched a blue film when I was in college.
have you ever gambled? - Never!
have you ever fought with somebody?
in the 5th grade I pushed my friend.
he had taken my lunch.
it's better you die.
I mean look at me.
my liver has shrunk due to drinking.
still I come here everyday.
ask him.
look at me.
I have a wife at home. Still I have two girlfriends.
one in Kandivli. And the other in Antop Hill.
saw my guts?
I took a loan of 3. 5 lakhs from the bank.
I have not repaid a penny.
saw my guts?
I forged my father's signature...
...and seized a plot worth 30. 5 lakhs.
saw my guts?
you look like Munnabhai film's Jimmy Shergil.
woebegone!
not a coward. But a dying man.
what do you want? What should I do?
I want that you learn to live before you die.
like this.
sir, I want a long vacation. Because I am going to die.
how irresponsible of you, Mr. Kaul!
at the time of year ending, life ending!
who will do the work?
who will do it? Who will do it?
I said Samosa . and not Laddoo . mama!
you won't reform even after dying.
you are making a list? Make it! Make it!
make your things to-do list.
what have you done in your boring life besides this?
drink more!
boring man! This is not the effect of liquor!
it's the effect of your boring life!
but who are you?
don't you recognize your face?
I am you.
I admit that grammar is not proper.
but I can't give you a better introduction.
you see... I am you.
relax! Relax! Relax!
Mr. Amar Kaul! This had to happen someday.
the man who lives with his own self...
...Finally talks to his own self too.
I won't live for long to talk to myself.
I heard you are going to die.
did you tell mama?
she won't be able to hear it.
Yes, which mother would be able to hear her son's...
she really won't be able to hear it.
her hearing aid is not working properly.
even if she heard, she won't be able to understand.
if she understood, she won't be able to tolerate it.
fine! Fine! Did you tell Vivek?
what's the use of telling him?
he never supported me in life. What will he support me in death?
fine.
tell me. What's your plan?
will you someday just place your head...
...on your own lap and die?
no. I will fight.
you will fight? I see. With whom?
the doctor? - No. Death.
all your life, you couldn't fight with life.
and you will fight with death!
look, you died a long time ago.
got it? And this... its just the printout of your death.
what do you mean?
I mean... what list were you making just now?
buying bottle gourd. Not zucchini.
giving the account to boss.
buying hearing aid battery for mummy. Repairing the geyser.
sitting on the donkey. Blah! Blah! Blah!
a person will die of boredom by reading your list.
so what should I do?
tear my clothes and roam around naked?
and shout... I am dying! I am dying!
sister, I am dying. Brother, I am dying!
I knew... nobody will understand.
but you are...
I am 37 years old.
I remained an accounts manager all my life.
I didn't marry.
don't you know what all things I endured in my life?
you are not born with a destiny like Shah Rukh Khan.
fine. Whatever little God has given you... enjoy it.
what are you trying to say? What do you mean?
I mean to say, according to me, your biggest ambition in life is...
...Repairing geyser urgently.
look, I too have many ambitions.
there are many things in life which I want to do. - Like what?
like... I want to buy a new car. I want to take a foreign trip.
and... - That's it!
now you have understood!
make its list.
things to do before I die.
new car.
Wow!
foreign trip.
that's better!
and love... Iove...
airbag, sir. Front and back.
cup holder. Cigarette lighter.
integrated rests on rear seats.
and yes, power steering and power window.
for your safety.
my safety? - Yes.
sir, if you want, I will take you on a test drive.
No!
what's the price of this car?
sir, you can take the car by giving a down payment of one lakh.
and the rest in installments. EMls.
how many EMls?
sir, for 48 months meaning four years, 18, 907.
four years is too long. Any shorter term?
Yes, sir. Two years which is approximately...
Yes! 35, 215. - Shorter than that?
one year.
don't you have any plan for three months?
sir, we don't have any scheme for three months.
you see, I want to repay it all within three months.
okay. I will just check.
it will be around 3, 15, 000 for one month, sir.
and it's not a very advisable thing to do.
