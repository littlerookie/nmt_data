we just want to hear your side of the story, that's all.
I need a break. You finish this.
Wallowski walks out before the interrogation is over.
well, they've been in there for 3 hours.
I mean, maybe she just needed a tinkle.
or maybe she was letting Farr blow the interrogation.
is there anything here you agree on?
Yes.
there's definitely some kind of relationship between Detective Farr and Suarez.
agreed. Farr does sound compromised at times.
well, if Farr's dirty, Wallowski's dirty.
what's that?
what is that, guilt by association?
may I remind you，You may.
you've got an eyewitness， I haven't forgotten.
Wallowski's arraigned in the morning.
my hands are tied.
she goes to county, that's a death sentence.
well, she either gives up her partner or she's on her own.
thanks for your help.
Oh, you wanted me to lie.
I see now.
Mrs. Phillips, are you comfortable?
I saw what I saw.
let's just get on with it, shall we?
OK, we just have a quick video we'd like you to take a look at.
and when I turn it off, just give us as much detail about it as you can.
there were 3 people.
a couple holding hands, an old man in a ball cap, and a blue car parked.
do you know what change blindness is, Mrs. Phillips?
changed what?
change blindness.
we see what we anticipate we're going to see, even if it changes.
the brain doesn't react to the change.
right. Like Charles here.
this was actually Loker just a minute ago.
so, you saw Wallowski drop Prince John off, but did you look away for any time before the shooting started?
I...I think I was brewing coffee.
and then when the shooting started, you looked out the window, you saw the shooter, right?
who you thought was the same person you saw with Prince John just moments earlier.
I was about to bring you that spoon.
how did you get me out?
change blindness.
what you lookin' at, Flaco?
lovely weather we're having.
I'm not talking about Farr.
balmy for this time of year.
you want me to talk about Farr cause you're working with I. A.right?
that's how you got me out of jail, you're working some kind of deal?
right. Well, that's that out of the way, then.
where do we go now?
straight to sex?
look, you know he's dirty, right?
it's not exactly breaking his heart selling you out, by the way.
what if he was? And I'm not saying that he is.
is what?
dirty.
you just said it.
there are two types of dirty.
one is who you are and one happens to you.
Oh, Farr's a victim.
do me a favor.
want to know how it happens?
how what happens?
corruption.
you did it again.
I'm too tired for this.
well, humor me.
I brought the wine.
so we isolated some of her reactions during the Suarez interrogation.
first interview after a softball from Farr, she purses her lips, barely noticeable.
5 months later, she looks away, brow furrows, much more intense reaction.
in an interrogation last year, you see disgust around her nose, on her mouth.
and finally 6 weeks ago, her entire body shifts away from Farr and she leaves the room.
so, in terms of intensity, her disgust with Farr rises from an "a" to an "e" in lock-step with Suarez's crimes.
as he went from joyriding to homicide.
she's known all along that Suarez and Farr had some kind of deal.
Lightman's watched all of these interviews， How could he miss this?
change blindness.
that's not bad for 7 bucks, eh?
you know about wine?
it's made from grapes.
what do you do when your partner busts a 14-year-old with a few grams of heroin?
you send them to juvie for a PhD. In criminology or cut 'em a break?
I don't know.
you tell me.
you start small.
you just fudge some paperwork here and there.
knock a banger around a bit, get a shooter out of him.
you know, that's all very interesting.
but not one mention of Detective Farr.
I'm trying to tell you, you get deep enough in, you can't get back out.
you know, two dead bodies is a world away from fudging a bit of paperwork, darlin, really.
So，Get on with it, then.
candles?
Cabinet， Top left of the stove.
sexy music.
on it.
lube?
just kidding.
you got a light?
Yeah. Home invasion, 85 North Pershing.
bloody hell. Untraceable, hey?
my dad said always have options.
Oi!
who's next?
you got 10 seconds to get your friend out of here.
we're done talking, All right.
glad you met me yet?
I think it's time to lose those.
just saying.
how long you gonna pretend there's nothing going on between Suarez and Farr?
you want to talk about this now?
the I. A. leaned on my partner to lean on me to give you up.
now, I'm being disloyal to my partner because you're being loyal to a man who's up to his neck in it.
you're saying Dr. Foster's wrong about me?
like she's wrong about me sometimes.
it comes from a good place.
you ever hear of off-duty Booty?
suarez is Farr's son.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, mate.
you.
raises the blood pressure, you know?
I me, if you want a "get out of jail free" pass from the I. A. you might want to get it under control, mate.
all right, suit yourself.
but it does make your neck blob out a bit, you know?
Oh, yeah.
well, you can stick a fork in her and all,'cause she's cooked.
you both are.
did you know that someone shot up her house last night?
Oh, first you've heard of it.
well, that's a good sign, I suppose.
you want to know who it was?
it was your boy Suarez.
and when I say your boy, what I mean is, your son.
19 years old.
mowing his way through his own gang while you look the other way.
you ok? - I'm good.
and so is Suarez.
it starts simple.
right? You're just trying to do the right thing, like any real dad would.
you can't protect him anymore.
he tried killing you last night.
choose.
your partner or your son.
detective Farr.
get me Lightman.
now.
he's not in yet.
well, he bends Farr's ear before the hearing,
Farr comes in and spills.
suarez is his son.
he's been in the kid pocket for years.
so you got your dirty cop.
Congratulations.
Farr's son killed Prince John and Stomper because he knew they were blackmailing Farr.
and Wallowski knew it, too.
she's dirty.
I mean, 8-hour days with Farr for 5 years?
it doesn't sound like proof.
Farr takes the heat, says Wallowski knows nothing.
lying through his teeth and Lightman put him up to it.
Oh, this isn't about Wallowski anymore, is it?
it's about Lightman.
you can choose Wallowski or your partner.
because I will bring down this whole circus act if I have to.
understand?
do you need that in writing?
her contempt for Farr's choices is getting harder to contain.
she knew about Suarez.
and you're sure about that?
put her in the cube for long enough, and if she's guilty, she'll betray herself.
the muscles in your cheek, relax them.
no, Hands down.
you cover your mouth, you give yourself away.
you know, if you teach me how to lie, you might never be able to trust me.
all right, pay attention.
focus on what we're doing.
you're not helping me.
you're just trying to save yourself now.
that was good.
you hid the contempt.
there are 4 key emotions displayed here.
disappointment, frustration, disgust, outrage.
and just like contempt, any of these would expose Wallowski's role in covering up Farr's crimes.
and you can show me what to look for?
and what to ask.
ask her a question she doesn't expect.
that's where you'll find unfiltered emotion, something she won't be able to hide.
you knew there was a relationship between Farr and Suarez.
they were friendly.
part of our work with gang unit is to connect with these kids.
but I had no idea until yesterday they were father and son.
Oh, that's good. Nice.
lying comes naturally to you.
good teacher.
just part your lips a little for surprise, you know.
they'll be looking for that.
I don't know if I can do this.
of course you can.
I can't lose the one cop I can squeeze, on the street.
tell me a lie.
anything you like.
I hate you.
now, that's brilliant.
you're ready.
you knew Detective Farr had a relationship with Marco Suarez?
we're meant to form relationships with street-level dealers.
but did you know he was helping Suarez commit crimes?
No， I didn't know anything about that.
but you do know that he beat Prince John to cover his relationship with Suarez, to support Suarez's move to control the Nine-Sixes.
now that he's confessed, sure, I guess.
was Detective Farr a good father to his children?
which ones?
to his regular family ones.
you mean his white ones.
don't deflect the question, Detective.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Oh, yeah.
he's incredible with his kids.
well, don't look at me, Loker.
give it to them straight.
I get nothing here. Zip.
was Wallowski in on this with Farr or not?
she's been coached.
or maybe she's clean.
and you Call yourself scientists?
you call cops who disagree cops?
unless one of them's dirty.
well, she's saying Wallowski's clean.
aren't you, Dr. Foster?
wait! What are you walking away for, hey?
that's not right，Don't do that.
never mind.
I'm not going anywhere, Gill, so let's have it.
what do you see in her, Cal?
I'd have done the same thing for my partner.
it's called loyalty.
that's kind of ironic from where I'm standing.
well?
is Wallowski lying?
Yes，Absolutely.
Farr is not a good dad， She's covering for him.
as for the rest of it, she's not lying.
she didn't know anything about Suarez or any of it.
Dr. Lightman?
Yeah, she's clean.
as a white.
years of my life, and for what?
well, you thought he was just looking after his kid, right?
so you did what you could.
and more.
loyal to a fault.
and when I say fault, what I really mean
she gets it, Cal.
thank you.
don't mention it.
you don't like me, do you?
I didn't do what I did for you.
no, you did it for him.
Where'd he go?
want to go grab a cup of coffee?
I'll take a rain check.
keep it in your pants.
you're not gonna need it.
my heart's racing.
your heart's not racing?
no. - Liar.
now my heart is racing.
Hey, what are you doing down here?
it's ok.
Yeah, we're police officers.
22 years as a cop, never fired my weapon.
and now this.
you two yum-yums ain't cops.
Joe, don't!
Hi, it's Torres. - The museum's just been broken into and you are liable for whatever's missing.
what? How is this my fault?
all I'm saying, Miss Torres, is this better not have anything to do with any of the people you supposedly vetted.
what do you mean us doing you a favor?
he's blaming you, Torres,
that's exactly what I would do in his place.
miss Torres, I went to the Lightman group and hired Dr. Lightman.
all I got was you.
cop got shot?
no, the thieves dressed as a cop.
how many thieves?
two.
other one's dead.
Dr. Lightman, good of you to show up.
always up for a party.
what, do you find this amusing?
you hired us to vet your staff and your security.
and right now you're hoping she messed up so you can blame this on someone else.
amusing. Laugh a minute.
but you leave her alone!
Hey, where are you going?
at ease. I'm a doctor.
you in a lot of pain, are you?
what do you think?
what were you trying to steal from the museum?
and who for?
we got a man dying here.
look around. What do you see?
I don't see anyone else dying.
you a doctor?
he's a witness.
a cop. You got some ID?
so, are you just gonna let him die, huh?
no, I'm gonna call security.
that's what I'm going to do.
you know what I see?
I see a woman who's been in this game far too long, who's lost the ability to serve.
excuse me.
right. She's gonna be back in a minute,
so make it nappy.
who are you?
a fellow art lover.
I'm partial to a bit of Van Gogh.
all the arts, artifacts.
you know, something small you can slip in your pocket, walk out of a museum with, you know, disguised as a cop.
I'll tell you this much.
the item is pre-sold.
the item?
Yeah. Yeah, the item. - Sold to who?
that's... that's all I'm gonna say until I walk out of here.
want to cut a deal against the people who hired you?
how many are there?
I guess I'm finally getting what I deserve, huh?
you hang in there.
what for?
Oh, don't be a wanker.
there must be someone, something...
Hey, I thought you could use some company.
Cal?
What'd you say?
never mind. I can see you're busy.
with her legs or with the case?
that obnoxious curator just hunted me down at the vending machine.
Sidney Carlton. Now, that's either a fake name, or the man was born a ponce.
he was... he was screaming at me that this is my fault.
that I screwed up vetting his staff.
that the only reason the thieves were at the museum was because someone there had leaked where the new art exhibit was being stored and I missed it.
you're blocking the view, love.
you know the difference between...
a monarch butterfly and a viceroy, Torres?
no.
well, look at her.
all right. Go on.
off you go.
what about you?
busy.
magazine?
I'm good. Thanks.
are you sure? - Yeah.
is this taken?
no.
you a patient or a visitor?
I have a friend in surgery.
is that man bothering you?
which man?
Oh, the one that was staring at you.
you mean you?
Oh, so you were ignoring me, then.
are you hitting on me?
wait, in this place?
it'd be a bit creepy, wouldn't it?
is it a close friend?
in surgery?
co-worker.
he doesn't have family,
so I thought... thought I should be here.
more than just a co-worker, then.
OK, how about you? Patient or visitor?
visitor. But it's a long story.
friend, relative?
I don't want to burden you with my problems.
suit yourself.
right. Well, good-bye and nice to meet you.
um, I didn't mean to be rude.
please sit.
lovers tiff?
worse?
that bad, eh?
he didn't make it, did he?
I'm sorry.
we did our best.
there was too much internal bleeding.
sorry.
Mr. Carlton, Ria Torres is very thorough.
and she doesn't work for you, she works for me.
those thieves knew exactly where the new exhibit is being stored.
they were shot 6 feet from it.
now, somebody at the museum tipped them off.
she interviewed everyone there.
except you.
what, are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?
What'd you find out?
I already told you, the man died before Dr. Lightman could get much out of him.
wait, not even what they were there to steal?
well, my guess would be art.
the opening is this friday.
a black tie gala fundraiser.
now, I need to know there is no danger of a second attempt.
Oh, I'd say there's every danger of a second attempt.
get out of my way.
Hey.
I was just gonna check if you're ok.
this is my friend Gill.
Hi, Naomi.
Hi.
I was just leaving.
call me if you need to.
I feel terrible for your loss.
I was gonna offer to buy you a cup of coffee.
what about your friend, co-worker?
routine surgery. Nothing like what you're dealing with.
I've got a half hour.
OK.
for the record, this isn't how we first met.
if anyone asks, we met online.
someone's feeling better.
can I ask how close a relative that was?
well, it depends what you mean by close.
is it possible, just a little bit, that you're playing the grief card with me?
I resent that.
is it working?
Naomi·Russel.
Cal·Lightman.
pleased to meet you, Cal.
call me Lightman.
and pleased to meet me, that's an understatement, that is.
when I beat the other guy to the seat next to you, you were relieved. Who was he?
come on, I saw that look in your eyes.
what look?
fear.
he's my ex-boyfriend. Jack.
What'd you do to him?
nothing. Why?
cause he wants to hurt you.
how do you know?
and I don't think it's over nothing, love.
all right, well, next time he shows his face...
I want to know, all right?
are you gonna clue me in?
in a fish tank! What?
please, you weren't really sleeping.
I was in the middle of a rather unusual dream.
was that woman in it?
what woman?
interesting personality.
I have no doubt.
tricky, though.
not to be trusted,
but then, you know, I like them that way.
you know what I mean? - Mmm.
did you notice anything odd about the janitor who was mopping up at the hospital?
have we given up knocking?
this is important.
I've been doing some checking into the museum staff.
the museum repaints before every new exhibit, and they always use the same guys.
no ID tag. The janitor.
Really?
isn't that what you're talking about?
no. My thing was more a feeling thing,
you know, but your thing's better.
better?
get your helmet on, Loker.
never crossed your mind, Torres.
temporary employees at the museum ever cross your mind?
what are you talking about?
Loker?
I found two painters who fixed the place up before every exhibit.
the curator never mentioned that.
I called both men in.
thank you, Loker.
did you look up those two butterflies that I told you about?
the monarch and the viceroy. Did you look them up?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're nearly identical.
a predator can't tell the difference between them.
all he knows is one of them's toxic, so he leaves them both alone.
so, do you get it, then?
get what?
if someone like that ponce at the museum takes a bite out of you, you make sure he regrets it.
OK?
well, off you trot, then.
the two painters Loker dragged in.
sometime this year would be nice.
who's Naomi?
so, no work permit, Mr. Garcia?
I love this country.
if only they'd make you legal.
is this about the robbery?
nervous tick.
people from some Latin cultures kiss their thumbs and then flick them as a swearing gesture.
like he swears he didn't do it.
Mr. Garcia, there's something else you're not telling me.
kiss? That looks more like a bite.
OK.
OK, Mr. Garcia. Thank you for your time.
we're looking for thieves, not family men.
Naomi! Open the door. I just want to talk to you.
open the door! I just want to talk to you!
come on, Naomi.
is this how you treat me, huh?
open the door! - Hey!
first the hospital, now you're parked up at her building.
what kind of a man are you, eh?
you got fabulous taste in men.
this is far from over, love.
your ex has got government plates.
immigration and customs enforcement.
did you report him?
I don't know why I' m so cold.
so, you want to ask me out?
can we go somewhere else?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
maybe you are smarter than me.
you go to college?
carnegie Mellon.
but you didn't graduate.
didn't need to.
because that would be beneath you.
I'm an artist.
you paint walls.
einstein was a patent clerk.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
I was a TSA screener.
no college.
Yeah.
you know why you're here?
to do with the attempted robbery last night.
ask the curator why he keeps ordering town cars and goes out to pay the guy in cash, but never gets in the car.
the curator?
Sidney ·Carlton.
Hey, where's Lightman?
um, not here.
you should try his office.
what?
what are you hiding?
he had me put a hidden camera on those two painters in the lobby.
he wanted to see what they did when no one was watching.
you guys used me as a decoy?
he planted a catalogue of the upcoming museum exhibit on the coffee table.
I thought he wanted you out of the lab.
just watch, ok?
because, like, you can't see what I can see.
see how he flips through the pages like he couldn't care less?
like he's looking through an issue of "cat lover."
Ahem.
you're a cat lover?
and I had you down for a poodle.
but your other painter...
he's taking his time,
soaking up the images.
Yeah, you see that?
turns to a specific page, then quickly moves on.
he's seen it before.
he doesn't need to see it again.
he's interested in something on that page.
and they're going to go back for it.
he's your inside man.
still think I should be fired?
an Egyptian statue of osiris and an emerald from India.
so what, in your opinion, is the most important piece in this new exhibit?
well, the statue of osiris without a doubt.
why pay cash for a town car you never actually use?
what's the money for? Catnip?
can I get a glass of water?
you're divorced; you have a teenage daughter, and you cook.
well, call me Mr. Right.
but enough about me.
what would I have found if you had invited me up to your place?
aside from the bad housekeeping,
I'm about as vanilla as they come.
want a bite?
that's the third time you've offered.
maybe I wasn't talking about food.
flirting while scared. That's unusual.
is your ex still on your mind?
you know, this is kind of a drag.
I can't seem to hide anything from you.
you don't want to.
you just don't know it yet.
this is like a therapy session in the middle of a police interrogation.
that's my idea of foreplay.
well, when I'm getting to know a man,
I like to put my best foot forward.
you're not letting me.
you're not listening.
I'm all ears, I am. Trust me on that.
and eyes.
and the rest.
don't call it foreplay if you don't mean it.
Ahem.
way to make a girl feel special.
Oh, you don't need me to tell you you're special, love.
you already know it.
Mr. Carlton, do you have a drug problem?
but you have it under control.
so what the painter saw was you paying your dealing.
and you know he saw you, which is why you failed to mention him when I was screening your staff.
what's this got to do with the attempted robbery?
the thief, before he died, said there was already a buy for something in the collection.
I bet that statue buys a whole lot of drugs.
now wait a minute.
even if I was a thief, I wouldn't steal from my own museum.
this exhibit is a game changer for me.
now, focus on the real suspects, not some recreational drug user.
he was telling the truth.
except the recreational part.
why am I here?
well, I seem to remember coming to your rescue.
you barely know me.
that's the way I like it.
relationships scare you.
well, we all have our weaknesses, Darling.
tell me.
scientifically...
Yes.
you haven't heard the question yet.
am I attracted to you?
well?
all right, for you, scientifically speaking, your breathing's shallow, your pupils are dilated.
you want me to carry on, do you?
I have a habit of jumping into things too quickly.
well, if it's a gentleman you're after, you're in the wrong house, love.
hold that thought.
Oh.
bang.
breaking and entering.
another day, another dollar working for the government.
you don't know what you're dealing with.
immigration and Customs Enforcement.
ice.
it's tough sounding.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen that look before.
on my ex-wife's face.
you really did a number on this one, darling.
he came here to use this.
you're crazy.
easy, tiger.
what have you been saying about me?
look at her face.
she's terrified of you.
what do you think she's been saying?
get out.
I'm wondering what it is you're really after.
I'm wondering why the world's leading deception expert can't see the world's biggest liar...
when she's right under his nose.
anything to add?
when you said you were crazy for me, was that the truth?
I have the habit of jumping into things too quick.
try not to be so hard on yourself, Ria.
we can't see everything all the time.
is Lightman giving you a hard time?
a retired cop, who had never fired his weapon, kills two men 'cause I dropped the ball.
it's my fault.
you get my message?
Uh-oh. The painter should be here any second. Loker's waiting in the lobby.
we told him that you were interested in his art.
right. Well, she's in the loo.
so, do your worst.
were you two talking about me?
you're all we ever talk about. You know that.
anything juicy?
Torres is upset. She thinks she messed up.
well, as well she should be.
I told her you'd understand.
good news. - Oh?
my new bird is trying to play me.
how is that good news?
I'm still working on that part.
you're working on it. For both of us?
see? I told you it was good news.
Oh.
Hi. You're the woman from...
the woman from the hospital. Your boss is helping me out.
with what?
I'm sorry. That's confidential.
it's just... we share all information here, like one big, happy family.
even personal information.
well, you said he's helping you out, so I made the leap to it, being related to the work we do here.
it's kind of personal.
well, that explains it.
it's just that he's been acting distracted.
Oh, no. That's a good thing.
Hey.
well, she's into you. That part seems genuine.
that's not what I sent you in there for.
I didn't see anything.
foster said that you wanted to make amends 'cause you screwed up at the museum.
my gut says that you're right. She's hiding something.
oi.
everyone screws up now and then, love.
this is Al·Larson, the painter from the Parker Museum.
painter, eh?
I paint the walls.
proper artist, then. - Yeah.
Loker, why don't you take Mistress Naomi to my office?
I'll be along later.
with me, Pablo.
I like to work in acrylics.
and I do limited edition prints.
and art theft.
surely you don't want anyone else to get killed.
you're talented. How much?
you used my art to get me in here.
no, I'm serious.
crime shouldn't pay, but this bloody well should.
you know what they say.
when life gives you lemons...
Chuck 'em at people.
that's what I do, anyway. This is what you do.
you don't kill people.
who said I had anything to do with that? - I did.
and you did, too.
and you're not proud of it, are you? This is what you're proud of.
I didn't know anyone would die.
what about Naomi?
did she know, eh?
I know you know her.
I met Naomi with the two guys who were killed.
one of whom died at the hospital. She was there for him.
she didn't have anything to do with the heist.
she tell you that, did she?
the first mention of guns, she was out.
she doesn't work like that.
she knew the museum hired me.
that's how she works.
she got to you.
didn't she?
who mentioned guns?
all I know is, they had a thing.
and he's having a hard time letting go.
is this what they were trying to steal?
probably both.
rude not to, really.
can I go now?
Nope.
there's only one way I don't call the cops.
that's the guy from the hospital.
Yep. That's Naomi's ex.
Naomi's part of the crew?
no. Her fear of him is so raw, it's real.
she's working against him. She's using me to take him out.
Mm-hmm. Before he shuts her up for good.
you got played.
would that make you feel better about your mistake?
Mm-hmm. A little.
when one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, right, lets me eyeball her, unchecked,
and then lets me hit on her, at will...
no, I never smelled a rat.
call the cops on these two.
what about Naomi?
Oh, no, don't be daft.
I'm not even half done with her yet.
I had your ex arrested today.
because of me?
well, it turns out...
he's using his job at customs to move stolen art.
stolen art?
Oh, bollocks. You knew. Be honest.
I knew he was up to something.
I know you're happy.
Heh. Can we call it relieved?
I was hoping...
you'd want to celebrate.
now?
would it be too old school if I asked for a date first?
uh, wow.
Oh, really, no, relax.
I'm just the same as most of the wankers out there.
it's just that I'm tired of making the same mistake over and over again.
you know what I mean? - Mm-hmm.
Parker Museum is having a posh do tomorrow night.
you up for it?
I don't have a dress.
Oh.
that suits me.
champagne at 12 o'clock.
do you know much about Egyptian art there?
I know when something's beautiful.
and pricey.
beauty and cost don't always go hand in hand.
you know, I could never quite understand what art saw in commerce.
you know, most artists will tell you that starving is overrated.
well, I bet the bloke in India who made this could use the 3 million's worth today.
that's just a rock.
Hi.
Naomi, you remember Torres.
RIA. - Hi again.
rental?
stole it.
you know, I'll go nab those drinks.
amongst other things.
you mean you want a sausage on a stick as well?
you like my butterfly?
Yeah. It's beautiful.
you know, at the hospital, she went out of her way to avoid eye contact with the janitor.
she knew him.
right.
keep an eye out for a man in his late sixties with white hair.
thank you.
Where's my drink?
here. All yours.
thank you very much.
you're staring.
it's just I don't want to let you out of my sight, darling.
I like that.
if this is going to work out, we have to allow each other some alone time.
Oh, we both know this isn't going to work out, love.
well, then, before our romance ends, can you grab us another glass of champagne?
old white people all look alike.
you just figured that out?
Wow.
if I didn't know better, I'd say you're surprised to see me.
no. I mean, wow.
you scrub up well.
thank you.
that was a good-bye kiss if ever I had one.
another?
have we met?
that's your best line?
dance, Ginger?
there's no music.
who needs music?
have you been drinking?
not enough.
it's the congressman. Someone call an ambulance.
he's been drugged. He'll get over it.
the statue!
she got it. I don't believe it.
how is that possible?
it's not.
guess what's in my purse?
it's not green, and it's not a rock.
tell me it's not about money.
this isn't about money.
OK. Tell me that again.
Why?
cause with your face, it's hard for me to do what I usually do.
this isn't about money.
the emerald is from Kali's Temple in...
I read the catalog description, love.
archaeologists smuggled it out of India in 1908.
it vanished, only to reappear in 1975 on the open market.
so he's taking it home, is he?
I know I lied to you.
technically speaking.
you just scared of Jack, huh?
we were partners.
he got tired of the Robin Hood act.
time to make a buck.
I split.
he couldn't take no for an answer.
because of Jack, my friends got killed.
when did you know?
well, all I knew was, that like most beautiful things, you wanted to be seen.
I didn't want any other people to die.
you could have got rid of Jack another way.
maybe I wanted to play with the world's greatest deception expert.
never crossed my mind that you were a decoy.
you won.
well done. I mean that.
I needed to get into the gala, or the emerald never returns to India, its rightful owner.
you want to have dinner?
a viceroy butterfly.
what does that mean?
FBI want to ask you some questions.
Oh, yeah?
do you know where she is?
long gone by now, I should think.
you gave her time to disappear.
I had to turn down...
dinner.
it wasn't theirs to take.
they didn't get it.
what haven't you told me?
well, I didn't actually...
get to tell you how beautiful you looked last night.
you're so irritating.
they stole a fake.
a fake?
I had the curator switch out the real one.
Why?
well, the real one's worth about 300 million...
the fake cost just under 100.
no. I mean, why keep me in the dark about that?
it's cat and mouse, Gill,
not cats and mouse.
that's what you're calling this?
tell me we're ok.
you know I've always had more trouble reading you than anyone else.
keep it in your pants. You're not gonna need it.
my heart's racing.
your heart's not racing?
no. - Liar.
now my heart is racing.
Hey, what are you doing down here?
it's ok.
Yeah, we're police officers.
22 years as a cop, never fired my weapon.
and now this.
you two yum-yums ain't cops.
Joe, don't!
the museum's just been broken into and you are liable for whatever's missing.
what? How is this my fault?
all I'm saying, Miss Torres, is this better not have anything to do with any of the people you supposedly vetted.
what you mean us doing you a favor?
he's blaming you, Torres, that's exactly what I would do in his place.
miss Torres, I went to the Lightman Group and hired Dr. Lightman.
all I got was you.
cop got shot?
no, the thieves dressed as a cop.
how many thieves? - Two. Other one's dead.
Dr. Lightman, good of you to show up.
always up for a party.
what, do you find this amusing?
you hired us to vet your staff and your security.
and right now you're hoping she messed up so you can blame this on someone else.
amusing.
laugh a minute.
but you leave her alone!
Hey, where are you going?
at ease. I'm a doctor.
you in a lot of pain, are you?
what do you think?
what were you trying to steal from the museum?
and who for?
we got a man dying here.
look around. What do you see?
I don't see anyone else dying.
you a doctor?
he's a witness.
a cop. You got some ID?
so, are you just gonna let him die, huh?
no, I'm gonna call security. That's what I'm going to do.
you know what I see?
I see a woman who's been in this game far too long, who's lost the ability to serve.
excuse me.
right.
she's gonna be back in a minute, so make it snappy.
who are you?
a fellow art lover.
I'm partial to a bit of Van Gogh.
all the arts, artifacts.
you know, something small you can slip in your pocket, walk out of a museum with, you know, disguised as a cop.
I'll tell you this much.
the item is pre-sold.
the item?
Yeah. Yeah, the item.
sold to who?
that's--that's all I'm gonna say until I walk out of here.
want to cut a deal against the people who hired you?
how many are there?
I guess I'm finally getting what I deserve, huh?
you hang in there.
what for?
Oh, don't be a wanker. There must be someone, something
Dr. Torres, please dial 1182.
Hey, thought you could use some company.
What'd you say?
never mind. I can see you're busy.
with her legs or the case?
that obnoxious curator just hunted me down at the vending machine.
now, that's either a fake name, or the man was born a ponce.
he was--he was screaming at me that this is my fault.
that I screwed up vetting his staff.
that the only reason the thieves were at the museum was because someone there had leaked where the new art exhibit was being stored and I missed it.
you're blocking the view, love.
you know the difference between a monarch butterfly and a viceroy, Torres?
no. - Well, look at her.
all right. Go on.
off you go.
what about you?
busy.
magazine?
I'm good. Thanks.
are you sure? - Yeah.
is this taken? - No.
you a patient or a visitor?
I have a friend in surgery.
is that man bothering you?
which man?
Oh, the one that was staring at you.
you mean you?
Oh, so you were ignoring me, then.
are you hitting on me?
wait, in this place?
it'd be a bit creepy, wouldn't it?
is it a close friend?
in surgery?
co-worker.
he doesn't have family, so I thought--I thought I should be here.
more than just a co-worker, then.
OK, how about you?
patient or visitor?
visitor. But it's a long story.
friend, relative?
I don't know want to burden you with my problems.
suit yourself.
right. Well, good-bye and nice to meet you.
um, I didn't mean to be rude.
please sit.
lovers tiff?
worse?
that bad, eh?
he didn't make it, did he?
I'm sorry.
we did our best.
there was too much internal bleeding.
sorry.
Mr. Carlton, Ria Torres is very thorough.
and she doesn't work for you, she works for me.
those thieves knew exactly where the new exhibit is being stored.
they were shot 6 feet from it.
now, somebody at the museum tipped them off.
she interviewed everyone there.
except you.
what, are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?
What'd you find out?
I already told you the man died before Dr. Lightman could get much out of him.
wait, not even what they were there to steal?
well, my guess would be art.
the opening is this Friday. A black tie gala fundraiser.
now, I need to know there is no danger of a second attempt.
I was just gonna check if you're ok.
this is my friend Gill.
Hi, Naomi.
I was just leaving.
call me if you need to.
I feel terrible for your loss.
I was gonna offer to buy you a cup of coffee.
what about your friend, co-worker?
routine surgery. Nothing like what you're dealing with.
I've got a half hour.
OK.
for the record, this isn't how we first met.
if anyone asks, we met online.
someone's feeling better.
can I ask how close a relative that was?
well, it depends what you mean by close.
is it possible, just a little bit, that you're playing the grief card with me?
I resent that.
is it working?
pleased to meet you, Cal.
call me Lightman.
and pleased to meet me, that's an understatement, that is.
when I beat the other guy to the seat next to you, you were relieved.
who was he?
come on, I saw that look in your eyes.
what look?
fear.
he's my ex-boyfriend.
Jack. - What'd you do to him?
nothing. Why?
cause he wants to hurt you.
how do you know?
and I don't think it's over nothing, love.
all right, well, next time he shows his face...
I want to know, all right?
are you gonna clue me in?
in a fish tank! What?
please, you weren't really sleeping.
I was in the middle of a rather unusual dream.
was that woman in it?
what woman?
interesting personality.
I have no doubt.
tricky, though.
not to be trusted, but then, you know, I like them th way.
know what I mean?
did you notice anything odd about the janitor who was mopping up at the hospital?
have we given up knocking?
this is important.
I've been doing some checking into the museum staff.
the museum repaints before every new exhibit, and they always use the same guys.
no ID tag. The janitor.
Really?
is that what you're talking about?
no. My thing was more a feeling thing, you know, but your thing's better.
better?
get your helmet on, Loker.
never crossed your mind, Torres.
temporary employees at the museum ever cross your mind?
what are you talking about? - Loker?
I found 2 painters who fixed the place up before every exhibit.
the curator never mentioned that.
I called both men in.
thank you, Loker.
did you look up those 2 butterflies that I told you about?
the monarch and the viceroy. Did you look them up?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, they're nearly identical.
a predator can't tell the difference between them.
all he knows is one of them's toxic, so he leaves them both alone.
so, do you get it, then? - Get what?
if someone like that ponce at the museum takes a bit out of you, you make sure he regrets it. Ok?
well, off you trot, then.
the 2 painters Loker dragged in.
sometime this year would be nice.
who's Naomi?
so, no work permit, Mr. Garcia?
I love this country.
if only they'd make you legal.
is this about the robbery?
nervous tick.
people from some Latin cultures kiss their thumbs and then flick them as a swearing gesture.
like he swears he didn't do it.
Mr. Garcia, there's something else you're not telling me.
kiss? That looks more like a bite.
OK. Ok, Mr. Garcia.
thank you for your time.
we're looking for thieves, not family men.
open the door.
I just want to talk to you.
open the door! I just want to talk to you!
come on, Naomi.
is this how you treat me, huh? Open the door!
first the hospital, now you're parked up at her building.
what kind of a man are you, eh?
you got fabulous taste in men.
this is far from over, love.
your ex has got government plates.
immigration and Customs Enforcement.
did you report him?
I don't know why I'm so cold.
so, you want to ask me out?
can we go somewhere else?
Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe you are smarter than me.
you go to college?
carnegie Mellon.
but you didn't graduate.
didn't need to.
because that would be beneath you.
I'm an artist.
you paint walls.
einstein was a patent clerk.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
I was a TSA screener.
no college.
Yeah.
you know why you're here?
to do with the attempted robbery last night.
ask the curator why he keeps ordering town cars and goes out to pay the guy in cash, but never gets in the car.
the curator?
Hey, where's Lightman?
um, not here.
you should try his office.
what?
what are you hiding?
he had me put a hidden camera on those 2 painters in the lobby.
he wanted to see what they did when no one was watching.
you guys used me as a decoy?
he planted a catalogue of the upcoming museum exhibit on the coffee table.
I thought he wanted you out of the lab.
just watch, ok?
because, like, you can't see what I can see.
see how he flips through the pages like he couldn't care less?
like he's looking through an issue of "cat lover.
you're a cat lover?
and I had you down for a poodle.
but your other painter...
he's taking his time, soaking up the images.
Yeah, you see that?
turns to a specific page, then quickly moves on.
he's seen it before.
he doesn't need to see it again.
he's interested in something on that page.
and they're going to go back for it.
he's your inside man.
still think I should be fired?
an Egyptian statue of Osiris and an emerald from India.
so what, in your opinion, is the most important piece in this new exhibit?
well, the statue of Osiris without a doubt.
why pay cash for a town car you never actually use?
what's the money for? Catnip?
you're divorced, you have a teenage daughter, and you cook.
well, call me Mr. Right.
but enough about me.
what would I have found if you had invited me up to your place?
aside from the bad housekeeping, I'm about as vanilla as they come.
want a bite?
that's the third time you've offered.
maybe I wasn't talking about food.
flirting while scared. That's unusual.
is your ex still on your mind?
you know, this is kind of a drag. I can't seem to hide anything from you.
you don't want.
you just don't know it yet.
this is like a therapy session in the middle of a police interrogation.
that's my idea of foreplay.
well, when I'm getting to know a man, I like to put my best foot forward.
you're not letting me.
you're not listening.
I'm all ears, I am. Trust me on that.
and eyes.
and the rest.
don't call it foreplay if you don't mean it.
way to make a girl feel special.
Oh, you don't need me to tell you you're special, love.
you already know it.
Mr. Carlton, do you have a drug problem?
but you have it under control.
so what the painter saw was you paying your dealing.
and you know he saw you, which is why you failed to mention him when I was screening your staff.
what's this got to do with the attempted robbery?
the thief, before he died, said there was already a buyer for something in the collection.
I bet that statue buys a whole lot of drugs.
now wait a minute.
even if I was a thief, I wouldn't steal from my own museum.
this exhibit is a game changer for me.
now, focus on the real suspects, not some recreational drug user.
he was telling the truth.
except the recreational part.
well, I seem to remember coming to your rescue.
you barely know me.
that's the way I like it.
relationships scare you.
well, we all have our weaknesses, darling.
tell me.
scientifically - yes.
you haven't heard the question yet.
am I attracted to you?
well?
all right, for you, scientifically speaking, your breathing's shallow, your pupils are dilated.
you want me to carry on, do you?
I have a habit of jumping into things too quickly.
well, if it's a gentleman you're after, you're in the wrong house, love.
hold that thought.
bang.
breaking and entering.
another day, another dollar working for the government.
you don't know what you're dealing with.
immigration and CEstoms enforcement.
ice.
it's tough sounding.
Oh, yeah.
I've seen that look before.
on my ex-wife's face.
you really did a number on this one, darling.
he came here to use this.
you' crazy.
easy, tiger.
what have you been saying about me?
look at her face.
she's terrified of you.
what do you think she's been saying?
get out.
I'm wondering what it is you're really after.
I'm wondering why the world's leading deception expert can't see the world's biggest liar...
when she's right under his nose.
anything to add?
when you said you were crazy for me, was that the truth?
I have the habit of jumping into things too quick.
try not to be so hard on yourself, Ria.
we can't see everything all the time.
is Lightman giving you a hard time?
a retired cop, who had never fired his weapon, kills 2 men 'cause I dropped the ball.
it's my fault.
you get my message?
the painter should be here any second. Loker's waiting in the lobby.
we told him that you were interested in his art.
right. Well, she's in the loo.
so, do your worst.
were you two talking about me?
you're all we ever talk about. You know that.
anything juicy?
Torres is upset. She thinks she messed up.
well, as well she should be.
I told her you'd understand.
good news.
my new bird is trying to play me.
how is that good news?
I'm still working on that part.
you're working on it. For both of us?
see?
I told you it was good news.
you're the woman from - the woman from the hospital.
your boss is helping me out.
with what?
I'm sorry. That's confidential.
it's just--we share all information here, like one big, happy family.
even personal information.
you said he was helping you out, so I made the leap to it, being related to the work we do here.
it's kind of personal.
well, that explains it.
it's just that he's been acting distracted.
Oh, no. That's a good thing.
well, she's into you. That part seems genuine.
that's not what I sent you in there for.
I didn't see anything.
foster said that you want to make amends 'cause you screwed up at the museum.
my gut says that you're right. She's hiding something.
wait
everyone screws up now and then, love.
this is Al Larson, the painter from the Parker museum.
painter, eh?
I paint the walls.
proper artist, then. - Yeah.
Loker, why don't you take mistress Naomi to my office?
I'll be along later.
with me, Pablo.
I like to work in acrylics.
and I do limited edition prints.
and art theft.
surely you don't want anyone else to get killed.
you're talented. How much?
you used my art to get me in here.
no, I'm serious.
crime shouldn't pay, but this bloody well should.
you know what they say.
when life gives you lemons - Chuck 'em at people.
that's what I do, anyway. This is what you do.
you don't kill people.
who said I had anything to do with that? - I did.
and you did, too.
and you're not proud of it, are you? This is what you're proud of.
I didn't know anyone would die.
what about Naomi?
did she know, eh?
I know you know her.
I met Naomi with the 2 guys who were killed.
one of whom died at the hospital.
she was there for him.
she didn't have anything to do with the heist.
she tell you that, did she?
the first mention of guns, she was out.
she doesn't work like that.
she knew the museum hired me.
that's how she works.
she got to you.
didn't she?
who mentioned guns?
all I know is, they had a thing.
and he's having a hard time letting go.
is this what they were trying to steal?
probably both.
rude not to, really.
can I go now?
Nope.
there's only one way I don't call the cops.
that's the guy from the hospital.
Yep. That's Naomi's ex.
Naomi's part of the crew?
no. Her fear of him is so raw, it's real.
she's working against him. She's using me to take him out.
before he shuts her up for good.
you got played.
would that make you feel better about your mistake?
a little.
when one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, right, lets me eyeball her, unchecked, and then lets me hit on her, at will
no, I never smelled a rat.
call the cops on these two.
what about Naomi?
Oh, no, don't be daft. I'm not even half done with her yet.
I had your ex arrested today.
because of me?
well, it turns out... He's using his job at customs to move stolen art.
stolen art?
Oh, bollocks. You knew. Be honest.
I knew he was up to something.
I know you're happy.
can we call it relieved?
I was hoping... You'd want to celebrate.
now?
would it be too old school if I asked for a date first?
Oh, really, no, relax. I'm just the same as most of the wankers out there.
it's just that I'm tired of making the same mistake over and over again.
you know what I mean?
Parker Museum is having a posh do tomorrow night.
you up for it?
I don't have a dress.
that suits me.
champagne at 12 o'clock.
do you know much about Egyptian art there?
I know when something's beautiful.
and pricey.
beauty and cost don't always go hand in hand.
you know, I could never quite understand what art saw in commerce.
you know, most artists will tell you that starving is overrated.
well, I bet the bloke in India who made this could use the 3 million it's worth today.
that's just a rock.
Naomi, you remember Torres.
RIA. - Hi again.
rental? - Stole it.
you know, I'll go nab those drinks.
amongst other things.
you mean you want a sausage on a stick as well?
you like my butterfly?
Yeah. It's beautiful.
you know, at the hospital, she went out of her way to avoid eye contact with the janitor.
she knew.
right.
keep an eye out for a man in his late sixties with white hair.
thank you.
Where's my drink?
here. All yours.
thank you very much.
you're staring.
it's just I don't want to let you out of my sight, darling.
I like that.
if this is going to work out, we have to allow each other some alone time.
Oh, we both know this isn't going to work out, love.
well, then, before our romance ends, can you grab us another glass of champagne?
old white people all look alike.
you just figured that out?
if I didn't know better, I'd say you're surprised to see me.
no. I mean, You scrub up well.
thank you.
that was a good-bye kiss if ever I had one.
another?
have we met? - That's your best line?
dance, Ginger? - There's no music.
who needs music?
have you been drinking?
not enough.
it's the Congressman. Someone call an ambulance.
he's been drugged. He'll get over it.
the statue!
she got it. I don't believe it.
how is that possible?
it's not.
guess what's in my purse?
it's not green, and it's not a rock.
tell me it's not about money.
this isn't about money.
OK. Tell me that again. - Why?
cause with your face, it's hard for me to do what I usually do.
this isn't about money.
the emerald is from Kali's Temple in - I read the catalog description, love.
archaeologists smuggled it out of India in 1908.
it vanished, only to reappear in 1975 on the open market.
so he's taking it home, is he?
I know I lied to you.
technically speaking.
you just scared of Jack, huh?
we were partners.
he got tired of the Robin Hood act.
time to make a buck.
I split.
he couldn't take no for an answer.
cause of Jack, my friends got killed.
when did you know?
well, all I knew was, that like most beautiful things, you wanted to be seen.
I didn't want any other people to die.
you could have got rid of Jack another way.
maybe I wanted to play with the world's greatest deception expert.
never crossed my mind that you were a decoy.
you won.
well done. I mean that.
I needed to get into the gala, or the emerald never returns to India, its rightful owner.
you want to have dinner?
a viceroy butterfly.
what does that mean?
FBI want to ask you some questions.
Oh, yeah?
do you know where she is?
long gone by now, I should think.
I gave her time to disappear.
I had to turn down... Dinner.
it wasn't theirs to take.
they didn't get it.
what haven't you told me?
well, I didn't actually...
get to tell you how beautiful you looked last night.
you're so irritating.
they stole a fake.
a fake?
I had the curator switch out the real one.
Why?
well, the real one's worth about... 3 million.
the fake cost just under 100.
no. I mean, why keep me in the dark about that?
it's cat and mouse, Gill, not cats and mouse.
that's what you're calling this?
tell me we're ok.
you know I've always had more trouble reading you than anyone else.
Ames is retired lapd.
you go near his house, you go near him, and he'll shoot you.

I wanna know where she is.

her family died, and she got a new one.
and don't you dare try to find her.
what they saw?
Hello?
the door was open.

you should lock your door.
I called twice.
phone, pool, Tina, Gina...
I did what you asked.
the children's service records on Rachel Seybolt.
you had 'em unsealed?
what do you want with Rachel Seybolt?
she used to call me her uncle.
that was a long time ago.
I think...
seeing what she went through, she might need some help.
I think seeing what I went through, I might be in a position to do that.
I had Rachel Seybolt's records unsealed.
the file was gone.
the jacket was empty.
it's not some big conspiracy, Charlie.
it's social services.
I'm sure the records...
fell behind a filing cabinet.
cupcakes?
you think they're not good for me?
I don't think...
you should be living on them.
I didn't think I'd be living at all.
I know, Charlie.
I know.
look, I heard the scream, and then I called security.
by the time the idiot guard showed up, it was too late.
Stephanie, honey, these are the police, not the security company.
don't edit me, Drew. Just back off.
all right, clear those people from the front.
we don't need a mob out there.
and I want their statements asap.
detective Crews called in and said he was already here.
find him.
copy that.
what do we got?
victim, male, gunshot, master bedroom.
can't find the gun.
signs of a break-in.
the back door's busted.
Yeah, so the alarm went off.
you know how many false alarms I get?
check his gun.
it ain't real.
company's afraid they'll get sued if I shoot anybody...
not that I ever get to.
all right, where are we?
anyone seen detective Crews?
you got a problem with gay mriage, officer?
I embrace our city's rich diversity, detective, like the department policy says I should.
Mm-hmm, you find his ring?
Oh, god!
LAPD. Show me your hands!
Hey!
do you not see the gun?
what do you got up there, a Costco?
cut it out.
now, get down here, or I'm comin' up after you.
Oh, jeez.
I just bought this suit.
this is Len Sand's partner, James muthupalanianppanwikma something.
Hi. James.
let me help you up.
I'm detective Reese.
how could anyone kill Lenny?
everybody loved Lenny.
did Mr. Sand wear a wedding ring?
both did, always.
we had them made special.
we found your partner.
get up.
you do not throw things at the lapd.
you're lucky I'm enlightened.
Yeah, well, I'm not as enlightened as my partner.
he was hiding down here.
I identified myself.
he threw a toaster at me.
throwing toasters at the lapd is bad.
makes you look like you're guilty of something. Are you?
you got anything in your pockets that'll stick me?
look at this.
U got a dead man's wedding ring in your pocket. You know that?
you're under arrest for the murder of Len Sand.
take him away.
you just called me your partner.
when?
just now.
no, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.
no. I never said that.
you heard her, didn't you?
you meant to rob, not hurt anybody, right?
it was an accident.
Where's the gun, by the way?
you been drinking?
ells like it.
so you were drunk.
you didn't know what you were doing.
all right, I am trying to help you.
anyone dies during a burglary, it's first-degree murder, special circumstances.
you're looking at the gurney.
baby powder!
for the poison ivy you got.
you ran through it on the hill.
I know to avoid it, but you must have not seen it.
I'd really like to get outta here.
I don't like it inside so much.
can't breathe in here?
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know?
why are you shouting?
am I?
it's been so long since I talked to anybody, and my voice...
sounds weird?
Yeah, that's right.
like someone else whispering in your ear?
how did you know?
what's your name?
Holt Easley, and I'm 61 years old.
you ever been arrested?
not for nothin' like murder.
I don't think I ever even picked up a felony.
all right, why were you in the backyard?
I live there.
it's better than shelters.
I never been in the house, though.
how come you had the victim's ring in your pocket?
I found it.
I did, I swear.
swear to god!
what were you trying to get away from?
if I say...
can I go?
no.
can I get a drink?
No!
but if you confess, we won't charge you with murder one or for assaulting detective crews.
or for stealing detective Reese's pen.
I seen that guy who lives with Sands kill him.
I seen him shoot him in the head.
then I seen him go out and throw that ring in the hills.
I found it.
I was gonna trade it for booze.
here.
take it.
anything that goes down his pants, you keep.
so what do you think?
well... I think he's lying.
I know he's a drunk and a thief.
or a nonconformi, a western archetype, cowboy on the range.
you actually believe the crap you say? it's not important what I believe.
it's important what he believes.
you give a flower sun, it opens up.
you give a man respect, same thing.
you think you're workin' him.
he's working you.
drunks are great at telling you what you wanna hear.
now you think he's innocent.
how long did you work on the Charlie Crews case?
four years.
Constance Griffiths attorney for Charlie Crews
that's a tremendous commitment.
most things worthwhile are.
W that charlie crews is free, do you need someone else to save?
it's not about what I need.
crews, isn't it?
Oh... Hey, uh...
I'm Neil Cudahy.
you... You're the reason I'm sittin' here.
is that right?
Yeah, when I saw on TV that Constance Griffiths got you out, I said...
that girl's gotta be my lawyer.
is that right?
charged with assaulting a man I don't even know, you know?
can you believe that?
but the sweetest part is I don't even have to pay.
she's doing me pro bono.
did she do you pro bono?
what are you doing here?
we have an appointment.
Yes, we do, Charlie.
later today.
I can't really figure out this calendar.
what's with that Cudahy guy?
he's a client.
I wanna talk to you about him.
well, I can't talk to you about a client. You know that.
what are you doing?
come back when your appointment is scheduled.
settle down.
what's all my stuff doing here?
you mean that stuff you stole?
I never stole a thing in my life.
you stole my pen.
Hey, everything I got in this world, including your pen, I found.
you can't believe what rich people throw out.
it works.
if I had a place to plug it in, I'd use the hell outta that.
got me through the winter.
there was five bucks, a chapstick, and six rubbers in the pocket.
and I kept 'em just in case.
one time I found nine clay pigs.
only thing they don't throw out is alcohol.
why would James kill Len?
we talked to theireighbors.
they said James and Len seemed happy together.
but I can tell you this.
what seems isn't always what is...
especially with rich people.
can you prove any of this?
did anyone ever see you dumpster dive?
that security guard run me off a few times.
you can go ask him. I ain't afraid.
except for the...
confusion over your pen, I ain't lied once.
homeless guy.
no, I never saw a homeless guy living back there.
you're not real bright, are you, Mr. Smith?
about average, I guess. Why?
is there a reason you ignored the alarm?
and the call from the neighbor about a scream?
I didn't like going by the Sand place.
it made me kinda sick.
cause they're gay?
no,'cause I'm lazy.
are we done?
ay, the guard didn't know Easley was living in the backyard.
meaning he doesn't back Easley's story.
maybe the guard's lying.
the coroner found fibers.
it looks like the shooter wore gloves.
the guard Smith wore gloves that night.
we tested him.
there was no gunshot residue.
Easley says he saw James.
let's see ifJames says he saw Easley.
Yes, this is my jacket, and these are all our things.
were these stolen from your house the night your husband Len was killed?
no.
we threw these things away months ago.
where did you find them?
a concerned citizen turned them over to us.
with this.
Where's the rest of it?
sorry?
well, the rest of the things that were taken?
it means the world to me that you found Len's ring, but you didn't find anything else.
you seem surprised.
I'm not surprised, disappointed.
the things that were stolen were the things that Len loved best.
a watch, his mother's candlesticks.
they, uh, they left all the expensive things.
how would they know what was most important to Len?
I...I don't know.
but whoever did is knew Len well.
really well.
so if the neighbors were near enough to hear a scream...
what else did they hear?
Len and James were a great couple.
they loved each other so much.
you ver heard them fight?
no, that's why I called Smith right away when heard the scream.
but it took him forever to get here.
tell them about your theory, Drew.
it's not a theory, Stephanie.
it's not anything.
I just heard officer Smith say things...
terrible things, homophobic things, particularly about Len and James.
drew thinks that Smith killed Len.
he thinks it was a hate crime.
I never said that.
Yes, you did, all right?
don't be a liar.
I mean, you're such a hypocrite.
Oh, hypocrite. My, my.
has somebody been reading?
don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.
well, then don't act like one.
all rich people are crazy.
it's not just you.
I think I'll give you my card.
okay.
drew says it's the guard.
Easley says it's James.
Yep... They call themselves neighbors, but they don't seem very neighborly.
detective Crews?
yes?
I couldn't talk before, but my husband Drew?
killed Len Sand.
I want your promise my identity won't be revealed.
we'll certainly do all we can to protect your anonymity.
why do you think your husband is the person who killed Len Sand?
because, sadly, my husband is...
a homosexual.
he was having an affair with Len Sand.
I think Len wanted to call it off, so Drew killed him.
you saw this?
you saw the murder?
I saw Drew leaving Len's house that night after I heard the scream.
that's why I called Smith the security guard, to tell him that I heard the scream.
because I didn't want Drew to know that I saw him.
you heard what drew said.
he's trying to frame Smith for this.
do you have proof?
I'm his wife.
he hid things from me.
I wouldn't testify against him anyway.
truth is...
I love him, I just can't stand to live with this anymore.
look, if we solve this fast, we won't have to book Easley.
why do you care?
well, I like the guy.
if I was a cowboy, he'd be my goofy sidekick.
kinda like how you're mine.
an affair.
Len and Drew Borns were having an affair.
are you serious?
Mrs. Borns seems to think so.
she said that she saw Drew leave here the night of the shooting.
did you ever suspect that Drew and Len would have an affair?
no.
I am, but they were good friends.
I always used to tease Len that he and Drew would make a great couple.
I suspected that Drew was closeted, but I...
look, it's...
it's possible.
we don't have enough evidence to take to a grand jury to charge Drew or James.
we got an eyewitness who says it was james.
a drunk homeless guy that we should have booked eight hours ago!
if the grand jury believes Easley, we can arrest James.
Plus, Easley won't last in jail.
no, if we don't book him, we're gonna lose him.
we can't babysit him forever, Crews.
sorry.
I ain't gonna last too long in county, boss.
Easley, listen, they got a good medical wing in there, okay?
just tell 'em you have hep C.
but I don't have hep C.
it'll buy you a few days in the infirmary while they run tests...
now you just hang in there.
Oh, I'll hangin there, for sure.
give me something...
something that proves you're telling the truth.
what the hell you think I been doing?
I can't think straight inside.
I need to breathe.
I can't in here.
the window.
there's a man with a gun.
you see it, Easley?
look at it hard.
I told you, it's James shooting the gun.
tell me everything you see.
James is pissed off.
he's got the gun.
what do you want?
what's he wearing?
a tie.
and a suit, I guess.
and gloves.
he's got gloves on.
you told him to say that?
no, I didn't. I swear.
smith wore gloves.
gloves like those?
no, they were different.
come on, let's go.
the coroner's report backs his story.
he saw what happened.
that's how he knows about the gloves.
or he knows about them because he's the killer.
look at him.
he look like someone who shot a guy to death?
if so, let's book him. If not...
it's time.
bus leaves in five minutes.
boss, please, don't make me go!
Hey, nobody's taking you anywhere.
I promise.
all right, all right, all right, all right.
Thanks. Thank you.
he's ready, you know?
we got him. He, uh...
we'll take him to the D. A. now, so thanks a lot.
come on.
what?
you never saw a bluff?
I'm kinda hungry. - Tough!
I could eat something.
what did I just say?
could we get burgers?
I could go for a burger.
No!
we gotta eat.
tacos?
I could go for tacos.
that's it!
if either of you says another thing about food or about anything, I'm gonna turn this car right back around, and I'm taking him back to jail!
what's that smell?
that's humanity, baby.
this is the right time, isn't it?
Yes, but, um, who's your friend?
if you're hungry, there's fruit in the kitchen.
I think he's a witness.
although there's a chance he's the killer.
why is he here?
I figured if he's guilty, then you get a new client.
if he's innocent, you get a new cause.
he's better than Neil Cudahy.
I checked his files.
Neil is not a good guy.
you checked his files?
I need a toilet.
down the hall and to the right.
haven't you got a private one?
Easley, be neat.
Neil Cudahy is a client.
you are not allowed to check his files.
I'm okay!
okay, no pblem.
you got a... a real nice setup in there. - Thank you.
can you go back in just for one moment?
because we're not done.
I'd rather not.
it's kinda rank.
what's this stack of mail?
that's your bills.
and I really wish you wouldn't have Ted pay them.
Ted's good with money.
Ted is good at stealing money.
there's this from the alcohol and tobacco commission.
it's your liquor license from the bar that you and your partner owned.
since you were acquitted, you're entitled to have itack, if you want it.
they fired me.
cause of not answering that alarm call.
you know, we never found the stuff that was stolen the night that Sand was shot.
you didn't happen to see any of it when you were poking around there, did ya?
I never poked around the Sands' place.
I don't like to be near the gays.
cause you can catch being gay.
there's that, yeah.
why'd you lie about Easley?
he says you knew that he was living there.
I knew it looked bad, him living there.
Oh, screw it.
they fired me anyway.
rich people suck.
a liquor license is hard to get.
that's a valuable asset, Charlie.
Hey, excuse me.
this is my plate.
that's your plate there.
you weren't eating.
well, because I was talking!
can I work in your bar, boss?
Look...Okay. You know what? Here.
you eat while the adults talk, okay?
I could run that for you, Charlie.
I would love to run a bar.
the last time I ran a bar, my partner ended up dead.
well, what are the odds of that happening twice?
that lady lawyer says he steals, boss.
I heard her.
all right, again.
tell me what you saw that night in detail.
you gotta get me a drink if you're gonna keep goin'.
maybe we should let him sleep.
Easley is the only way we can get to James.
first is getting the grand jury to believe that Easley saw James shoot Sand.
if they do, they'll indict.
if they don't, then we got nothing else, and James gets away with murder.
I'm getting you something to drink.
wait. We don't want him hung over in the grand jury.
when was your last hangover?
1974.
he's a functioning alcoholic.
he works better with booze.
trust me.
they got Drew Borns at the station for questioning.
he's there right now, no lawyer.
what do we do with Easley?
this ain't bad.
when I come back, I'm gonna bring you something to help you sleep.
I'll be waiting.
I'm not a killer.
I run my own hedge fund, for god's sake.
Stephanie and I fit, but I can't believe she thinks I'm a killer.
do you believe she thinks you're gay?
Yes, I can believe that.
Really?
why is that?
she's very aggressive sexually.
I work hard, long hours.
I get tired.
whenever I don't want to have sex, she accuses me of being gay.
she's intolerant, homophobic, unstable.
I love her.
I'm wealthy enough to take care of her.
but I won't go to prison for something I didn't do.
any more questions, call me.
I've got nothing to hide.
but don't you dare accuse me of anything.
you know, most cases we get no eyewitnesses.
this case, we get two...
and they both suck.
Stephanie says it was Drew.
Easley says it was James.
do you really think Easley's lying?
no.
no.
if he were, he would have jumped on blaming Drew, you know?
gave him the chance, but he wouldn't do that.
Oh, my god.
I locked him in.
is anybody hurt?
excuse me, is...
What'd you bring me?
I fell asleep smoking.
I'm sorry.
fire department come and cut me out.
Where'd you get the booze?
I'm gonna be honest with you.
there's a liquor store on the corner.
when the owners...
come out to see what all the fuss was about,
I went in and...
took a few things.
crews, from now on, he's all yours. 24/7.
you wanted him.
you got him.
Sand's will was filed in probate court.
it says that James gets all of Sand's property when he dies.
James had a financial motive.
did Drew have a financial motive?
no. Drew's rich.
if he killed James, it wasn't for the money.
who are you?
I'm Charlie's roommate.
no. i'm Charlie's roommate.
Easley's staying at your house?
Yes, and he's been touching my stuff, Charlie.
I think he used my toothbrush.
did not.
smell my breath.
I ain't even close to minty.
if I used your toothbrush, I'd be minty.
I ain't the kinda guy who uses another guy's toothbrush.
so how many coffees did you let him have, Ted?
six.
once we got that machine of yours going, we really let it ride.
all right, just take him home, get him cleaned up.
he is going to the grand jury.
we are going to bring sexy back to the bar scene.
our target demographic is gonna be 18- to 29-year-olds, at least initially, to create buzz.
gotta be 21 to drink.
we're gonna serve tapas and sushi.
you gotta get the young in for the dancing, the old will then follow.
I wouldn't drink there.
it's too fancy.
Yeah. You are not our target demographic. Okay?
our specialties will be coladas and daiquiris.
sounds fruity.
you know what? Charlie happens to like fruit.
and the markup on fruit drinks is huge.
all right, let's talk names.
one word names are very hotight now, okay?
"Stir" is good.
also "shaken."
sounds fruity.
you oughta grow more trees outside, boss.
give you privacy.
nobody'll see when you kill Ted.
nice suit.
it's Ted's.
it's too clean.
nothing in the pockets, not even lint.
I used to keep a big rubber band in my pocket.
it lost its snap, dried out.
I really liked that rubber band.
are you gonna make it?
I don't think so.
come on, we're gonna be waiting outside for you here all the time.
you ain't goin' inside?
no, no.
witnesses in the grand jury have to be in there alone.
Oh, Crews, he's not gonna make it.
what are we gonna do?
all right.
witness prep?
if we don't indict now, James is gone.
you want Easley's testimony or not?
I feel better, boss.
okay. Thanks.
what?
what?
your new friend here said he'd never been in Sand's house?
labs came back.
his DNA was all over it.
you're not going to the grand jury.
you're going to jail.
you were the lead detective on the Charlie Crews murder case?
Yeah, I work that case.
took my 20 right after we closed it.
no DNA's gonna tell me we got the wrong guy.
detective Carl Ames lead detective Crews murder case
crews, Easley's DNA is in the house.
how do we explain that?
he's got a nice smile.
uh... I'm not sure I know what you mean by that.
well, for a guy who lives in the woods, he's got a nice smile.
Ted said he used his toothbrush.
you know, I think he was minty.
I don't know what DNA is.
how'd I know how it got in the house?
I ain't lying.
okay, boss, I used Ted's toothbrush 'cause I didn't have one.
and you tracked mud in and out of our house.
you take your shoes off when you went into Sand's pce?
just to use the bathroom now and then.
you know, to get clean.
you should have told us sooner.
I didn't say nothin' 'cause I know it looks bad.
but I never went inside unless I knew no one was home.
how could you tell?
windows.
they had the most windows and fewest trees.
you're lying.
I'm not lying this time.
I swear it!
prove it right now, or I walk outta here, you go back to "D" unit and you die there.
what do you want me to say?
I'll say whatever you tell me.
wait, boss.
please don't leave me.
I'm not your boss.
I'm not your friend...
and I'm not giving you any more chance.
you're all out.
okay, okay.
I can prove James mermerha...
I can't say his name.
he's the one who did it.
but we're gonna need a shovel.
I'm telling you, he's playin' us.
because there is nothing under here that even...
clay pig.
okay.
you got that list of things James said was stolen?
Yeah.
first item.
four folders of antique coins.
Yep. Got those in here.
ah? How 'bout sterling silverware?
Yep. Got that too.
Ah, what about letters?
no. No letters.
love letters.
signed by...
you wanna know what else is in here?
what?
Yes, I wrote those letters.
my fingerprints could well be on the things in the bag too.
Len always showed off those things when we'd go over to visit.
you stole the letters, along with the other things that Len Sand loved.
Why?
they're all addressed to "my love."
no name.
those are letters that I gave to my wife Stephanie.
can you prove that?
no, detective, I don't keep copies of love letters to my wife I didn't know I need to.
James and Stephanie put that stuff there, hoping we'd find it and blame Drew.
they didn't count on Easley taking it and burying it.
but how do we prove it?
the frame worked.
drew looks guilty.
we know that.
we know James and Stephanie know that.
they don't know we know.
what they do know is that if we found the bag, we'd focus on Drew.
so they then know what to say when we come.
and so?
I'm not hearing a plan.
well, let's see if they embrace not knowing what they don't know.
no. No, I didn't get it.
are you sure?
okay.
I'll look for it again.
can I ask why you called me down here?
it's n a big thing.
would... Would you just ve me one minute?
this isn't something we could do over the phone?
maybe I should have 'em send it down again.
Oh, here it is.
have a seat, Stephanie.
do you know how I got that bag?
why would I know that?
James gave me that bag.
that's what he's out there talking to detective Crews about right now.
so, James, your neighbor, Stephanie Borns, found the items that you reported stolen.
she's in there with my partner giving her statement.
when... Um... When did she find them?
she called this morning.
but don't worry.
your items are all being indexed, and they will be rurned to you...
plus a few you left out.
left out?
what... What things?
I got the list here.
you don't know what's in the bag?
no, I told you I don't know.
cause James said you do.
he told my partner that you know exactly what's in that bag.
two "Lali-Kay" candlesticks.
am I pronouncing that right,"la-li-kay"?
lalique.
that's glass.
glass, right?
it's french glass.
weird, her bringing the bag in here like that.
it's your stuff. You'd think she'd just call you about it.
I guess people just like to cooperate with the police.
James gave me this bag and said that you shot Len Sand.
that you shot his husband.
he's finalizing his official statement with detective Crews right now.
you got a first edition book on bondage.
of human bondage.
French, like the glass?
english, like the language.
he says you shot Len sand using that gun, Stephanie.
it has your husband's fingerprint all over it, my husband's prints.
James said you wanted to set Drew up for that murder, so you shot Len Sand and left the gun and these other objects for us to find.
why would I do that?
I had no motive to kill Len.
I liked him.
we couldn't figure out the motive.
you didn't get anything from Len Sand's death.
that's true.
I didn't.
but you'd get everything if Drew was blamed for it.
come on, Stephanie.
drew's rich, you're not.
he controls all the money.
your prenup states that you get everything if Drew gives you cause for a divorce.
now, a murder conviction.
guess what? That's cause.
you and James both make out.
you get all of Drew's money, he gets all of Len Sand's.
but James over there...
got cold feet and brought us this bag.
okay, let me see. Almost done.
here we go. one patek-Philippe chronograph.
what is that?
a watch.
you should have just put that down here.
I'll fix that for ya.
it's okay.
watch.
he says you shot Sand, Stephanie.
he gave us this bag and said that you shot Sand.
you had access to your husband's gun.
it makes sense.
but these are all on the list.
just one last item here.
we got an automatic. 40 caliber.
that's a gun, James.
should I write it down that way?
G... U... N.
come on, Stephanie. Time's running out.
talk now or pay later.
okay, Okay. I...
I...I did take the gun.
okay, but I didn't kill Len.
okay, I gave the gun to James.
he shot him. He did it...
look, I was gonna get Drew's money.
he was gonna get Len's.
but I never shot anyone, okay?
we were gonna frame Drew, but James shot Len...
not me.
not me.
they've been in there a long time, my partner and Stephanie.
I wonder what they're talking about.
Stephanie's pretty high-strung.
you notice that?
Oh, god. What did you tell them?
what have you done?
what have you done?
you put your bag on the hillside, knowing we'd find it.
you didn't count on cloiber, cloiber.
that was gonna be his treasure.
that bag of stolen stuff I found was gonna be my ticket.
well, you want to stay at my house for a while, that's not a problem.
sure, boss.
just might do that.
that way, he can use the bathroom when he wants to without committing a felony.
well, a man's gotta stay minty.
isn't that right, Easley?
that's right.
see? Minty.
detective Carl Ames lead detective Crews murder case and the daughter, where was she?
she was at a sleepover.
how many times I gotta tell you that?
she was there, wasn't she?
her bed was unmade.
she was there when it happened, not at a sleepover.
Rachel was in the house.
Hello?
hello.
Jesus, Charlie.
you scared me.
I didn't mean to.
what are you doing here?
I, uh...
I wanna ask you to do something, and I just need you to do it.
Charlie, tell me why you're here.
I need you to drop Neil Cudahy as a client.
you need me to?
what does that mean?
you know what that means.
do you want to save him, connie?
I'm just defending him.
do you wanna save him like you saved me?
cause he's not me, Connie.
what are you asking?
I'm asking you to drop Neil Cudahy.
that's all you're asking?
Yeah.
don't back away from this, Charlie.
you started it when you came here tonight.
I just want you to drop Neil Cudahy.
you don't have the right to ask that.
unless you want that right.
do you, Charlie?
I was looking for you, and I didn't even know it.
and now you're here, and I can't have you.
you're married.
and if I weren't?
you have a husnd.
and I think about...You...
when I'm with him.
I need you to be all the way in.
and if you can't be all the way in...
then I need you all the way...Out.
you know I can't do this.
Yeah.
okay.
whatever it is that you're doing is keeping you from being here.
you're still in prison.
the next time you're gonna have to get another lawyer to get you out.
he was here this afternoon.
I saw him.
he asked if I would buy him a giant rubber band.
said he used to have one but that it...
dried up.
lost its snap.
poor easy.
I thought telling the truth would set him free.
when's that ever worked?
she saw him.
she saw the killer.
now THAT CHARLIE CREWS IS FREE
do YOU NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO SAVE?
it's NOT ABOUT A WHAT I NEED.
do I FEEL BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
Yeah, I FEEL BAD. AD DO I FEEL GUILTY?
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU, AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.
and NOW YOU'RE HERE, AND I CAN'T HAVE YOU.
buy ME A DRINK. --DO I KNOW YOU?
does IT MATTER?
I'm NEIL CUDAHY
is THAT RIGHT?
be RIGHT?
Hello? - CHARLIE?
what's WRONG?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHOELSE TO CALL.
CACONSTANCE, WHAT'S HAPPENED?
I'm SO SCARED.
what HAPPENED?
Hey.
as CUDY.
he DID IT. HEID
no, NO. NOT LIKE THAT.
he JUST...JUST WANTED MONEY.
he THOUGHT THAT COULD GET THAT FOR HIM,
and WHEN I SAID THAT I COULDN'T DO THAT,
wanted HIM TO BE YOU.
all THOSE YEARS,
you WERE MINE.
know.
hold ME.
it's GONE 'S GOKAY.
it's A DEAD ANGEL.
how DO YOU KNOW? - WELL, I KNOW THAT WKNINGS ARE FAKE
I'm NOT DOING THAT WITH YOU.
witness SAYS SHE JUST FELL OUT OF THE SKY.
wham!
angel WINGS?
you THINK SHE CAME FROM...
that WINDOW.
I THINK SHE CASH FROM THAT WINDOW.
I WAS WONDERING, YEAH, IF I COULD ASK YOU A FAVOR
sure, CHARLE. NAME IT.
I DON'T REMEMBERER ME CHECKING IN.
well, SHE PROBABLY WASN'T WEARING WINGS AT THE TIME.
no CLOTHES IN THE CLOSET??
unfortunately HER WINGS COULD NOT SAVE HER.
if YOU'RE HERE TO I. D. THE ANGEL,
they ONLY LOOK LIKE ANGELS,
but, THEY'RE NOT.
when ANGELS DIE... - IT'S THE END.
you WANNA TOUCH ME?
they FEEL LIKE REALITIES.
you WANNA KNOW A SECRET ABOUT ANGELS?
Absolutely.
we're NOT ALWAYS SO GOOD.
I'm NOT HUNGRY. GO AHEAD.
can I SEE THE PICTURE?
just TO BE SURE.
no.
no, THAT'S NOT OUR KYLE
detective, MAY I ASK WHEN YOU LOST YOUR FAITH?
I'd RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT MY FAITH.
I'm WAITING FOR YOU IF YOU WANT IT
whenever YOU WANT IT.
you KNOW THAT, DON'T YOU, DEAR?
I'm TAKING A BREAK.
I'm IN NO HURRY. GO AHEAD.
that's A REAL FREAK SHOW.
I DID THAT WHAT YOU ASKED.
went BY THAT GUY'S WORK AND APARTMENT.
hasn't BEEN SEEN AT EITHER OF THOSE SINCE YESTERDAY.
I RAN A LIST OF HIS KNOW ASSOCIATES.
want ME ARREST SOME OF THEM?
Hey, WHATEVER IT IS, MAN, I'M OKAY WITH IT.
we GOTTA GO.
what WAS THE DEAL WITH STARK?
he WANTS US TO START A BOWLING LEAGUE.
just BECAUSE THE WINGS WERE FAKE ?
maybe SHE WAS AN ANGEL IN THE WAY WE ALL MIGHT BE ANGELS.
we ALL MIGHT BE ANGELS?
crews, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'm SURE I'M NOT AN ANGEL.
see, THAT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF THE HUMBLE AN ANGEL MIGHT IS.
that WAS VERY HOSTILE.
whose GENIUS IDEA WAS THIS?
what DO YOU SAY, REESE?
write 'EM UP AND SEND 'EM HOME?
we ALL DID THINGS LIKE THESE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
you KNOW, PRANKS.
I TRIED. GOOD LUCK.
you KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING? I GOT THE CALL TO INVESTIGATE THIS?
I WAS INVESTIGATING A MURDER CASE
all RIGHT, LET'S GO.
that WAS HOSTILE.
she ISN'T AN ANGEL, AFTER ALL.
it WAS A SURPRISING AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK.
several THOUSAND PAGES.
does HE FEEL IN DEBT TO YOU?
dective CREWS, HE DOESN'T OWE ME ANYTHING.
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.
so DETECTIVE CREWS WAS JUST ONE OF YOUR CLIENT？
hm, NO.
of COURSE NOT.
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.
no, I DON'T WANT CHANGE, RON. WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.
how DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?
Oh, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT YOU.
what, YOU'RE A COP?
now JUST NOW I'M NOT.
so WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'm LOOKING FOR YOUR PAL, CUDAHY.
and DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.
let's NOT DO THAT, OKAY?
you CELLED WITH HIM FOR FOURTEEN MONTHS UP AT LOMPOC,
and THEN AFTER YOU HAD A LITTLE BUSINESS.
mething ABOUT GIRLS, RIGHT?
you BREAK UP MY FINGER.
I...I DON'T UERONSTAND YOU.
do THOUGHT, RON.
often GETS IN THE WAY OF THE TRUTH.
do LET THE TRUTH MAKE ITSELF KNOWN
I DON'T KNOW WHERE CUDAHY IS.
can MAKE SOME CALLS.
LET...LET ME MAKE SOME CALLS.
is THAT THE TRUTH
yeah
there. GOOD AS NEW.
better THAN NEW.
because NOW, YOU HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE.
look, IF I...IF I FIND CUDAHY,
Who...who SHOULD I SAY WAS LOOKING FOR HIM?
he'll KNOW.
she FELL OUT OF WINDOW.
it's LIKE SHE'S NO ONE
no ONE.
now YOU SOUND LIKE ME.
would IT BE SO BAD?
I'm IN NO HURRY.
go AHEAD.
Hey.
I KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT THE JOURNEY,
you're JUST GONNA HAVE TO GET TO THE FRONT LINE.
detective CREWS.
DETEIVE REESE.
cause I'M AFRAID.
afraid OF WHAT?
afraid OF THE ANSWER?
that's RIGHT.
the's AN ANSWER AT THE FRONT LINE.
that's RIGHT.
I'm THAT GUY.
which GUY IS THAT? - THE BAD NEWS.
but YOU CAME DOWN HERE, JASPER.
so YOU DID WANT TO KNOW, DIDN'T YOU?
and NOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
you're AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
I SAW THE...
photo ON THE NEWS
of THAT WOMAN ON THE CAR.
and I THINK I KNOW HER.
how DO YOU KNOW HER?
she's LENA.
my WIFE.
I CAME HOME FROM WORK LAST NIGHT,
and LENA ALWAYS HAS DINNER READY.
she WASN'T HOME.
she ALWAYS HAD DINNER READY?
every NIGHT.
she LIKED TO COOK.
may I ASK WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DO?
I MAKE GLUE.
I...I OWN A COMPANY THAT MAKES INDUSTRIAL GLUES AND ADHESIVES.
we MOVED OVER $14 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PRODUCT LAST YEAR.
that's A LOT OF GLUE.
well, IT'S WHAT HOLDS US TOGETHER.
that's OUR SLOGAN.
it's WHAT HOLDS US TOGETHER.
do YOU KNOW WHY YOUR WIFE WAS AT THE HOTEL?
I HAVE TO ASK, UH...
she WAS WEARING WINGS.
do YOU KNOW WHY?
I NEVER SAW THOSE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE WOULD HAVE THEM ON.
do YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO'D WANT TO HURT YOUR WIFE, JASPER?
he WOULD.
he?
he TOLD HER HE'D TAKE HER AWAY FROM ME IF I DIDN'T PAY.
but I PAID EVERY MONTH, AND HE TOOK HER ANYWAY.
who SAID THAT?
tell US HIS NAME, JASPER.
then TELL US ABOUT YOUR WIFE.
I...I MET LENA ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
at THIS BAR THAT I'D HEARD ABOUT, RITUAL.
where DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT BAR?
it's WHERE AN OLDER MAN CAN FIND...
what HE NEEDED? - SHE WAS FROM RUSSIA,
and SHE'D HAD A HARD TIME THERE,
and SHE LIKED THAT I COULD MAKE HER LAUGH.
and YOU HAD TO PAY EVERY MONTH?
not AT FIRST, NOT FOR THE FIRST YEAR.
and THEN WE GOT MARRIED, AND... AND...
I HAVE TO GO NOW.
I...I JUST CAME TO SEE IF IT WAS LENA.
to SEE IF IT WAS HER, AND I
I NEED TO GO HOME NOW.
what HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED?
is THAT DOOR LOCKED?
you ARE IN A POLICE STATION.
is THAT DOOR LOCKED?
what HAPPENED WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED?
we CAME HOME THAT NIGHT, FROM THAT PARTY AND...
he WAS IN OUR HOUSE.
who WAS?
why WAS HE IN YOUR HOUSE?
he WAS SITTING IN MY KITCHEN.
Lena MUST HAVE GIVEN HIM THE KEY
or THE ALARM CODE.
and THAT IF I WANTED HER TO STAY WITH ME,
I HAD...I HAD TO PAY HIM EVERY MONTH,
or HE WOULD TAKE HER AWAY AND HE WOULD PUNISH HER.
he BEAT HER LIKE A DOG.
he'd MAKE LENA LIVE IN A CAGE
like A DOG.
tell US HIS NAME.
I PAID!
I PAID $10, 000 EVERY MONTH!
why DID HE TAKE HER FROM ME IF I PAID?
Why?
give US THE NAME, JASPER, OF THE MAN WHO KILLED LENA.
no LAST NAME, JUST ROMAN.
that's IT.
we're RUNNING IT, BUT ROMAN IS LIKE...
John IN RUSSIAN.
so THE RUSSIAN GIRL IS A NATASHA.
a LENA.
no, HER NAME IS LENA, BUT SHE'S A NATASHA.
it's WHAT THEY CALL THE SCAM THE RUSSIANS RUN ON AMERICAN MEN.
get THEM HOOKED ON A PRETTY RUSSIAN GIRL,
get THEM MARRIED, THEN COME FOR THE PAYMENT.
itit's A LONG-TERM CON. TAKES PATIENCE.
sounds LIKE YOU ADMIRE THEM.
I RESPECT HOW GOOD THEY ARE.
and YOU'LL RESPECT THEM TOO, OR...
or...?
or THEY WILL FEED YOU TO THEIR DOG.
industrial GLUE.
it's WHAT HOLDS US TOGETHER.
that's ONE WORD FOR IT.
she WAS A PROSTITUTE, CREWS, NOT AN ANGEL.
you CAN'T BE BOTH?
well, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT THERE'S A RULE
that SAYS YOU CAN'T BE A PROSTIE AND AN ANGEL.
I KNOW A PROSTITUTE AT PELICAN BAY WHOSE NAME WAS ANGEL.
they HAVE WOMEN AT PELICAN BAY?
no, SHE WASN'T A WOMAN WOMAN.
and JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR, I DIDN'T "KNOW" HER...HIM.
didn't KNOW HER...HIM.
but SHE DID MAKE A NICE CARROT CAKE.
maybe I SHOULD GO IN FIRST.
it's SOME KIND OF UPSCALE PICK UP JOINT,
and, YOU KNOW, I'LL GO IN AND I'LL...
and YOU'LL...?
I'll GET... PICKED UP.
I'll BE TEN MINUTES.
so I'M NOT TOO OLD, I HOPE.
Ah, NO. NOT TOO OLD.
anyways, I DON'T LIKE ALL THESE YOUNG MEN IN L. A.
I THINK I SCARE THEM.
Oh, YEAH? WHY IS THAT?
because THEY'RE SO EASY TO READ.
I CAN SEE HOW SILLY THEY ARE.
they ALL WANT ONE THING, YOU KNOW?
can YOU READ ME?
do YOU WANT ME TO?
I CAN TELL... YOU HAVE MONEY.
the WATCH TOLD YOU THAT.
I CAN TELL IT IS NEW MONEY.
now, HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
and I CAN TELL THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR NEW MONEY.
do YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN TELL?
what?
I CAN TELL YOU'RE A COP.
I CAN TELL SHE'S ONE TOO.
her NAME WAS LENA.
she WAS THROWN FROM A WINDOW.
I HAD SEEN HER AROUND, BUT NOT FOR A LONG TIME.
do YOU KNOW WHAT A NATASHA IS?
you LET HER TALK FOR YOU?
do YOU KNOW A MAN NAMED ROMAN?
I KNOW A LOT OF MEN NAMED ROMAN.
it IS COMMON NAME IN RUSSIA.
officer NEW MONEY,
how COME YOU LET THE WOMAN DO YOUR BUSINESS?
I CAN READ PEOPLE TOO.
I ALSO THINK YOU KNOW THE ROMAN MY PARTNER ASKED YOU ABOUT.
know ROMAN?
no ONE KNOWS ROMAN.
all RIGHT, REALLY...
what IS IT WITH THIS GUY?
what IS WITH ROMAN?
he's NOT WHAT YOU AMERICAN COPS ARE USED TO.
he WAS BORN IN RUSSIAN PRISON.
he's BEEN TO HELL AND BACK.
Roman IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF US.
why IS THAT?
Roman HAS NO FEAR.
well, I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM ABOUT THAT.
maybe YOU CAN TELL US WHERE TO FIND HIM.
don't WORRY. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ROMAN, HE WILL FIND YOU.
but YOU CAN'T HOLD ON TO HIM.
when YOU REACH OUT FOR ROMAN, HE'S NOT THERE.
I SAW THE NEWS.
so SHE WASN'T AN ANGEL AFTER ALL.
she WAS JUST A... A WHAT?
just A LOST GIRL.
Hey,
you DIDN'T FILE A REPORT ABOUT CUDAHY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
Oh, I'M DONE WITH IT.
you're DONE WITH IT.
right, CHARLIE? YOU'RE DONE WITH IT.
do YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE BOXES?
cause IT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY'RE MOVING.
pack BOOKS INTO BOXES.
I'm GOING TO NEED THEM WITH ME IN NEW YORK.
I'm GOING TO NEW YORK.
when?
tomorrow.
for HOW LONG? - A WHILE.
my FIRM HAS A BIG CASE THERE,
and I'M GOING TO SIT IN ON IT.
new YORK.
city THAT NEVER SLEEPS.
no, I'VE BEEN THERE. IT SLEEPS A LITTLE. NAPS.
I NEED TO GO, CHARLIE.
I NEED TO GO AWAY.
my HUSBAND...
I'm HERE WITH HIM, BUT I'M AWAY FROM HIM.
and YOU...
I'm HERE WITH YOU, BUT I'M
I'm NOT HERE WITH YOU.
I NEED TO GO.
want SOME HELP WITH THOSE BOXES?
no, MY HUSBAND'S ON HIS WAY, AND HE'S GOING TO HELP ME...
...PACK.
so I GUESS I SHOULD TAKE OFF THEN.
Yeah.
okay.
Roman IS ROMAN NEVIKOV.
we RAN FINANCIALS ON RITUAL.
he DOESN'T OWN IT.
a COMPANY THAT HE OWNS, OWNS A COMPANY THAT OWNS IT.
LAPD HAS HAD THIS GUY ON THEIR RADAR FOR YEARS.
stolen DVDS, IDENTITY THEFT, GASOLINE SCAMS.
Oh, KEEP READING.
he ALSO LOVES THE BLOOD SPORT.
he's HEAVY INTO DOG FIGHTING,
anything THAT DIES.
he SAID HE'D MAKE LENA HIS DOG.
he SAID HE'D MAKE LENA LIVE IN A CAGE LIKE A DOG.
that's WHAT JASPER SAID ROMAN WOULD DO TO LENA IF HE STOPPED PAYING.
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN AFTER THIS ANIMAL ROMAN FOR YEARS,
and I DON'T SEE ONE INDICTMENT IN HIS JACKET.
not ONE CHARGE IN HERE THAT STICKS.
you CAN'T HOLD ON TO HIM.
you REACH OUT FOR ROMAN, BUT HE'S NOT THERE.
that's WHAT JULIA SAID.
well, I WANT YOU TWO TO REACH OUT
and BRING BACKUP TO MAKE SURE YOU HOLD ON TO HIM.
Lena MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AN ANGEL,
but SHE WAS A WOMAN LIVING IN MY CITY.
if ROMAN KILLED HER, I WANT HIM FOR IT.
is HE IN THERE?
well, DETECTIVE, WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY SURE ABOUT THAT.
either ROMAN IS IN THERE OR ROMAN IS NOT IN THERE.
21-DAVID SAW HIM ENTER THE BUILDING, 23 AND 25-DAVID WERE UM...
not ABLE TO VERIFY.
an ESCALADE HAS PULLED UP TO THE BUILDING.
all UNITS, HOLD YOUR POSITION.
is THAT CLEAR? HOLD YOUR POSITION.
doors OPENING, NO CLEAR SIGHT OF THE SUBJECT.
this IS 23-DAVID, WE HAVE EYES ON THE SUBJECT
entering THE CLUB.
negative THAT. THIS IS 25-DAVID.
subject HAS LEFT THE CLUB. SUBJECT IS IN THE SUV.
23-DAVID, DO WE HAVE A GO TO ENTER THE CLUB?
we NEED INSTRUCTIONS.
do WE ENTER THE CLUB OR FOLLOW THE VEHICLE?
a LITTLE FREAKY, RIGHT?
a LITTLE BIT.
okay.
officer NEW MONEY...
cuff ME.
report CAME BACK FROM INTERPOL.
our NEW FRIEND, ROMAN, IS A PERSON OF INTEREST IN FIVE MURDERS BACK IN RUSSIA.
man, THIS GUY IS A SOCIOPATH.
so WHAT'S HE DOING IN THIS COUNTRY?
how DOES ROMAN GET INTO THE U. S?
what ARE YOU THINKING?
we STARTED OUT LOOKING FOR AN ANGEL.
and NOW WE'RE STARING AT THE DEVIL.
how YOU DOING?
splendid.
I LIKE THIS ROOM.
you DO? - 12 YEARS IN PRISON,
and YOU'RE STILL WALKING UPRIGHT.
just BETWEEN US...
you KILLED THAT FAMILY, DIDN'T YOU?
that BELONG TO YOU?
do YOU MEAN DID I OWN HER?
we HAVE A WITNESS WHO PINS YOU TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING.
you KNOW WHAT KIND OF TIME THAT CARRIES?
he WON'T TESTIFY.
why NOT? - HOW'S THAT REHAB WORKING FOR YOU?
down TIME'S THE HARDEST.
you HAVE NOTHING TO DO,
your MUSCLES GET ALL TWITCHY.
you CAN TASTE IT IN THE BACK OF YOUR THROAT.
shut UP.
shut YOUR MOUTH.
you GOT HOOKED WORKING UNDERCOVER.
shut YOUR MOUTH.
took A JUNKIE LOVER TOO.
whatever HAPPENED TO HIM?
you LOOK AT ME WHEN YOU TALK.
you KNOW WHAT A NATASHA IS, ROMAN?
you THINK THIS GIRL IS A NATASHA,
and I KILLED HER.
let ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
if SHE WAS MY NATASHA, EARNING MY MONEY,
why WOULD I KILL HER?
I'm A BUSINESSMAN... IT'S JUST BAD BUSINESS.
you HAVE A GOOD LOOK.
you EVER WANT TO MAKE SOME REAL MONEY,
you SHOULD CALL ME, OKAY,
detective DANI REESE?
now, IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES,
my OVERPRICED LAWYER'S GOING TO COME IN AND TELL YOU
that THERE'S NOTHING TO TIE ME TO THIS POOR DEAD GIRL.
then MY LAWYER IS GOING TO TELL YOU
that HE AND I ARE LEAVING.
it WAS A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.
and YOU, DETECTIVE.
what IF IT WAS ONE OF THEM WHO SET YOU UP?
so WHERE ARE WE?
we're UH...WE'RE BACK AT THE BEGINNING.
okay.
so LET'S GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING.
the HOTEL ROOM WHERE SHE WAS THROWN.
when ROMAN SAID THOSE THINGS,
did YOU WANT TO SHOOT HIM?
Yes.
me TOO.
did YOU SEE YOURSELF SHOOTING HIM?
Yes.
me TOO.
you LOST YOUR FAITH BECAUSE OF THE GUY,
not THE DRUGS.
my FAITH HAS BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG,
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS THAT I LOST IT.
or IF I EVER EVEN HAD IT.
so THEY WERE HERE, BUT NO ONE WAS REGISTERED.
so HOW DO YOU GET INTO A ROOM WITHOUT REGISTERING?
you STEAL A KEY.
or YOU BUY ONE.
Stan, ARE YOUR EMPLOYERS HERE AWARE...
that YOU WERE FIRED FROM YOUR LAST THREE JOBS FOR STEALING?
nothing's MISSING. I DIDN'T STEAL NOTHING.
no, YOU CAN'T STEAL NOTHING.
nothing DOES NOT EXIST.
to STEAL SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST...
wait.
if IT DOESN'T EXIST...
then HOW CAN IT BE SOMETHING?
ha! I HATE THAT.
don't YOU HATE THAT?
it's A BRAIN FART, RIGHT?
nothing's BEEN STOLEN, STAN.
but YOU DO HAVE A PASS KEY, DON'T YOU?
so YOU WANT US TO QUESTION YOU ABOUT THIS,
or ABOUT THE MURDER THAT HAPPENED HERE?
my BUDDY OLIVER, HE DOES MY INK.
I PAY HIM WITH PASS KEYS.
look, NO ONE WAS STAYING HERE.
how IS THAT STEALING?
so WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU DO HERE?
mostly TATTOOS AND AIRBRUSH STUFF ON CARS AND BIKES.
we WORK IN METAL AND FLESH.
what DOES OLIVER DO HERE?
Oh, JUST THE DESIGNS.
he DESIGNED...HE DESIGNED THIS.
it's GOOD, RIGHT?
I HAVE THE SAME DESIGN ON MY DUCATI.
metal AND FLESH.
that's RIGHT.
you WANT A TATTOO?
Oh, I HAVE SOME.
come ON.
when DOES SOMEONE LIKE YOU GET TATTOOS?
it's COMPLICATED.
that's OLIVER'S WORK STATION.
when WAS HE LAST HERE?
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE A FEW DAYS.
people KIND OF COME AND GO HERE.
you GOT A GREAT VIEW OF ROMAN'S NIGHT CLUB FROM HERE.
do YOU REALLY HAVE ANY TATTOOS?
you WANNA SEE 'EM?
absolutely NOT.
we HAVE A WARRANT TO SEARCH THESE PREMISES.
I HAVE A PASS KEY.
that's HER, RIGHT?
that's LENA.
art SCHOOL GRADUATE.
and LOVER OF ANGELS.
we FIND HIS CAR AROUND THE BLOCK FROM THE HOTEL,
where LENA DIED.
mail STACKED UP OUTSIDE HIS DOOR.
no CHARGES ON HIS CREDIT CARD.
no CHARGES ON HIS STARBUCKS CARD.
this KID IS NOWHERE.
no ONE IS NOWHERE.
now YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE ME AGAIN.
am I?
okay.
okay, THAT PICTURE WITH LENA IN THE WINGS.
she POSED FOR THAT PHOTO.
she PUT THOSE WINGS ON AND POSED
so THAT OLIVER COULD TAKE THAT PICTURE.
so YOU THINK MAYBE LENA...
put THOSE WINGS ON FOR OLIVER?
now, WHO WOULD LENA TALK TO ABOUT THAT?
where IS OFFICER NEW MONEY?
detective NEW MONEY, ACTUALLY.
these RUSSIANS ARE TOUGH.
sounds LIKE YOU ADMIRE THEM.
Lena POSED FOR THAT PHOTO, DIDN'T SHE?
Yes.
who'd SHE PUT THE WINGS ON FOR?
for OLIVER.
he SAID SHE WAS HIS ANGEL.
Lena AND OLIVER WERE IN LOVE.
she WAS MARRIED TO THAT JASPER.
she WAS WORKING FOR HIM...
Roman, BUT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT PUNK KID OLIVER.
she WORE EXPENSIVE DRESSES,
and SHE KNEW HOW TO ORDER WINE,
but SHE WAS ONLY 23 YEARS OLD AND...
and SHE WANTED TO BE YOUNG.
Yes.
how OLD ARE YOU, JULIA?
22, BUT...
none OF US ARE YOUNG.
I DON'T KNOW.
but LENA WAS LEAVING.
Lena AND OLIVER WERE LEAVING.
she WAS LEAVING JASPER.
she WAS LEAVING ROMAN.
what WOULD ROMAN DO TO LENA IF HE FOUND OUT?
he WOULD KILL HER.
even THOUGH SHE MAKES HIM MONEY?
he'd KILL HER TO SET AN EXAMPLE.
that's RIGHT.
to SET AN EXAMPLE.
and WHAT ABOUT OLIVER?
I DIE, YOU KNOW,
as I SAY THESE THINGS TO YOU.
we CAN PROTECT YOU.
what WOULD HE DO TO SWEET OLIVER
trying TO STEAL HIS PROPERTY?
death WOULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HIM.
you UNDERSTAND, DON'T YOU?
is THAT DOOR LOCKED?
you're AT A POLICE STATION.
is THAT DOOR LOCKED?
that's A LOT OF FEAR, JASPER.
to BE SO AFRAID OF SOMEONE IN THE MIDDLE OF A POLICE STATION.
that KIND OF FEAR DOESN'T COME FROM A THREAT.
it COMES FROM A BEATING.
when YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DOGS, JASPER,
about WHAT ROMAN WOULD DO,
did HE DO IT TO YOU?
did HE SHOW YOU THE CAGE?
Roman's GOING TO KILL SOMEONE ELSE, JASPER.
someone LENA
someone LENA LOVED.
where ARE THE CAGES?
he BLINDFOLDED ME.
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHERE THEY ARE.
do YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING?
anything THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL?
it SMELLED LIKE GASOLINE.
even WITH ALL THOSE DOGS,
it SMELLED LIKE GASOLINE.
what ABOUT THAT GAS SCAM THAT ROMAN WAS NEVER TIED TO?
where DID THEY OPERATE OUT OF?
gasoline. NO ONE FIRES.
over HERE!
she WAS MY ANGEL.
did ROMAN KILL LENA?
he THREW HER OUT THAT WINDOW.
we MET THERE.
we THOUGHT WE WERE SAFE,
we THOUGHT NOBODY COULD FIND US.
he FOUND YOU.
she'd PUT THE WINGS ON FOR ME.
I'd DRAW HER...
for ME.
Roman FOUND YOU.
Yes, SHE...
she TOLD HIM WE WERE GONNA LEAVE.
he LAUGHED AT US,
he LAUGHED AT HER WINGS.
she...
spit AT HIM AND...
and THEN?
then HE THREW HER OUT THE WINDOW!
took ME HERE
to BE HIS DOG.
will YOU TESTIFY TO THAT IN COURT?
you WILL TESTIFY THAT ROMAN KILLED LENA?
he MADE ME HIS DOG.
ready?
ready, READY.
detectives REESE AND CREWS,
this IS SPECIAL AGENT BODNER.
homeland SECURITY.
Oh, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LIKE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.
well, I'D JUST SAY LAY BACK AND GET IT OVER WITH.
but WE TOOK THIS SEMINAR, SO NOW I DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
you TOOK ROMAN. - DETECTIVE, WE'VE HAD ROMAN.
he's OURS. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN OURS.
he KILLED A WOMAN.
we HAVE A WITNESS THAT'LL TESTIFY TO THAT.
I'm SURE YOU DO.
but YOU CAN'T HAVE A TRIAL, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE ROMAN.
like I SAID, HE'S OURS. - HE THREW A WOMAN OUT THE WINDOW.
Roman NEVIKOV PROVIDES INFORMATION
about DRUG AND ARMS SHIPMENTS BETWEEN RUSSIA, MEXICO, AND THE U. S.
that INTEL CAN SAVE HUNDREDS OF LIVES.
that's ENOUGH.
detective, YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE REAL WORLDS WORKS, - DO YOU? - NO, BUT I KNOW HOW GUYS
like YOU WORK, AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE POWER, ISN'T IT?
you...you CLOSE YOUR MOUTH NOW.
and YOU.
take YOUR RUSSIAN AND GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE.
you CAN'T HOLD ON TO HIM.
you REACH OUT FOR ROMAN, BUT HE ISN'T THERE.
Hello, NEIL.
Oh, YEAH...
I'm TRYING TO FORGIVE YOU, CUDAHY.
but WHAT YOU DID TO CONSTANCE...
I JUST WANTED WHAT YOU GOT.
they PAID YOU THAT MONEY JUST TO SHUT UP.
why SHOULDN'T THEY PAY ME TOO?
I KNOW I'D BE A BETTER PERSON IF I DID FORGIVE YOU.
I JUST WANTED WHAT YOU GOT.
I've CALLED THE POLICE.
I AM THE POLICE.
Hey. - HEY.
Hey, DID YOU EVER FIND THAT GUY YOU WERE LOOKING FOR?
no. NO, I NEVER DID.
Hello?
detective...
I HAVE SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.
Oh, YEAH? WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
the BANK OF LOS ANGELES SHOOT-OUT.
how 'BOUT IT?
you SHOULD ASK YOUR PARTNER ABOUT THE BANK OF L. A. SHOOT-OUT.
that WAS 15 YEARS AGO.
I KNOW.
you SHOULD ASK YOUR PARTNER.
you SHOULD ASK YOUR PARTNER
what HAPPENED TO ALL THAT MONEY.
good-bye, DETECTIVE.
I'm with stupid.
the arrow's pointing up.
isn't it supposed to point at the person next to you?
I guess he was admitting the truth.
that he was stupid?
that no one knows anything.
I know he's dead.
that's not the truth. It's just a fact.
looks like a rose.
Oh, you gonna tell me that's the truth?
no, that's just a dead flower.
we're putting up a parking garage.
eight floors, 500 spaces.
what was it before?
storefronts.
most of them vacant for years.
we're gonna need to know the name of the store that was in this space.
Yeah, I can find that out for you.
the guy's been in the ground for who knows how long.
we dig him out, then after we're done with him, we're gonna put him back in.
is there somewhere else you think maybe he should go?
Los palmas zen center.
in business for two years.
from 1995 to 1997.
went out of business because?
the owner, a guy named Tim Chang, skipped out owing three months rent.
what exactly is a zen center?
it's a place where people interested in their spiritual journey sit and do nothing.
which, as it turns out, is nearly impossible.
getting buried alive part of that spiritual journey?
not as a rule, no.
though every center has its own way.
tim Chang.
I.D. Expired 1998.
he's been down there the whole time.
Oh, look at this.
I used to have one just like this.
I remember this model.
so cute.
stored, like, ten numbers.
the battery is toast.
but I can get information off of the chip.
last numbers called, date and time.
who remembers their number from ten years ago?
I do.
but it wasn't a phone number.
prison Number
looks like he dialed these two numbers a bunch of times on November 30th, 1997.
give me a few hours, I can get the backdated reverse directory and give you names to go with those numbers.
or we could just call one.
tim Chang.
I haven't thought of him in years.
ten years.
they found him underneath the zen center?
someone buried him while he was still living.
my god.
how can they even tell that?
he had inhaled dirt into his lungs.
what was your relationship with Tim Chang?
I didn't have one.
but when we dialed that number, it rang here in your house.
this wasn't my house ten years ago.
it's my husband's house.
I moved here after we were married.
I was the one who had the relationship with Tim.
Luke, these are the detectives I told you would be stopping by.
detectives, this is my husband, professor Luke Dujardin.
we're both on staff at U.S.C. Particle physics.
but we are not actually on staff there.
we are just more likely to be on staff there than not to be on staff there.
don't play with them, darling. They're not your students.
they are the police.
so they must know everything is in motion.
and the particles within everything are never in one place.
therefore, if it's never in one place, it never is, is it?
so I'm always in motion.
I'm never in one place.
I'm never here.
just more like to be here than not to be here.
I'm not here.
you like that, don't you?
if only that were true.
Luke, they're here to talk about master Chang.
we uncovered his body under what used to be the zen center.
Oh, no.
and all this time...
professor Dujardin, what was your relationship with Tim Chang?
12 years ago I suffered from a common ailment in my field.
I had a crisis of faith.
if you look at anything too closely it starts to lose its meaning.
and your crisis of faith, master Chang helped you through this?
Yes, he did.
you wouldn't happen to know where you were when Tim Chang went missing?
that was ten years ago.
does anyone know where they were ten years ago?
I'm pretty sure I do.
we looked for him when he went missing.
we went to the zen center every day, but
Amy, those two pot heads with the videotapes.
videotapes?
they made an instructional tape with master Chang and sold it online.
they were so peculiar.
I can't remember their names though.
see that car, not here.
that building, not here.
not actually here, just more likely to be here than not be here.
that dog, not here.
that girl, not here.
too bad about that.
this street.
this city.
everything.
not here.
if you're not here, then how come I can still see you?
I guess not here.
if you understand physics, which I really don't.
hello.
those tapes were made by a company based out of an apartment in Palms.
no longer in business.
I did, however, track down the owners' names.
can you track down the owner's address?
master Tim, dead?
zen master Flash, buried alive?
that is wrong.
zen master Flash " ?
Yeah, that's what we used to call him.
because he was a zen master with flash.
you made an instructional tape with Tim Chang?
not one of our best sellers.
made it out of some crappy apartment you used to have?
different part of town.
not so much money back then, huh?
that was before quickie-mate.com.
you heard of us, right?
I'm not really up to date with all the dots and their coms.
Quickie-mate.
a mate in a minute.
it's why we're not living in Palms anymore.
was master Chang aware that you were using marijuana?
uh, I would have to say yes.
very aware.
and did it cause any conflict?
only when we wouldn't share.
zen master liked to be one with the bong.
didn't you think it was odd that he just disappeared one day?
no, we thought it was zen.
Oh, Sherri, Ginger, say hi.
Hi.
our wives.
are these more investors?
no, they're cops.
you want a beer?
they're cops, Sherri.
cops get thirsty.
don't cops get thirsty?
all the cops I know get thirsty.
no thank you.
we're working, and one of us is a recovering alcoholic.
I'm still in pre-hab.
good luck with that.
Thanks.
we've been married for two years.
quickie-mate.com.
was supplying Tim Chang drugs the sole nature of your relationship?
no, mostly we went to the zen center for the girls.
the place was loaded with, like, broken yoga chicks, you know the kind.
you two didn't date a lot in high school, huh?
or in college?
Yeah, well, that all changed when we got rich.
do you know where you were when Tim Chang went missing?
that was... Ten years ago.
who knows where they were ten years ago?
I used to think, what if I had believed him?
Jennifer Conover Ex-Wife of Charlie Crews
what if I hadn't walked away?
would he be here now?
I mean, we would have come through this together. We would have won.
but I didn't believe him.
and I've learned it's better not to think that way.
Oh, for god's sake. -- Hey, Mark.
my ex-wife around?
this isn't pulling me over.
this is now trespassing.
this will only take a minute.
Hey, Jenn, you around? Jennifer?
it's okay, Mark.
I got this. -- Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
go on in.
he's very tall.
I didn't know you liked tall men.
if i'd known, maybe I could have been taller.
are you in counseling, Charlie?
you know what today is?
Yes, Charlie. I do.
15 years. Not bad.
it's our anniversary.
I understand how today might be painful for you.
you were a pretty bride, Jenn.
smokin', I think is what the kids say now, right?
Hey, Mark, you know she was a smoking bride? -- Okay.
you showed up, you pissed on my husband.
you're doing whatever it is you're doing to me.
you can go now.
I came here today, Jenn, because I made a promise to you.
I know I'm not exactly married to you anymore. But...
happy anniversary.
you didn't.
a promise is a promise, Jenn.
I promised you one.
a promise is a promise.
you can't leave this horse here, Crews.
it's not really there, Mark.
I mean, it's physics, it's complicated.
but trust me, it -- it's not actually here.
what's that smell?
horse.
you curious why?
not remotely.
hello.
okay, reverse directory on the third number.
graziella Molina has had the same number for 45 years.
did she go to the zen center?
no, but her son did.
he used to live at home, but has since moved out.
can you send me his address?
can you say "please"?
please?
can I help you?
I'm looking for Eric Molina.
uh, that's him sparring out on the mat.
which one's Molina?
he's the one that's still standing.
that's Tim Chang, isn't it?
zen master Flash.
his body was under the zen center.
that's right.
we tracked the numbers Tim Chang dialed on his cell phone.
one of them was your mom, Eric.
she told us where to find you.
I was living with her back then.
my life is here now.
you don't seem too broken up to hear that your master's dead.
his body has lost its vitality.
his spirit exists still.
it will find another vessel and return someday.
we're curious about those pictures you went down on your knees for.
I bow to master chang after every fight.
Yeah, why is that?
out of respect.
I would not be alive if it wasn't for master Chang.
master Chang recreated me.
how did he do that?
he crushed what I was.
and allowed a new me to step forward.
didn't like who you were, Eric?
no, sir.
I did not.
I was in a gang when I met master Chang.
master Chang made it hard on you.
all for my own good.
you're searching for something.
aren't you?
I'm searching for the person who killed master Chang.
no.
something else.
you got that look.
and master Chang had it too.
he was searching for something.
did he find it, Eric?
you can't find it, man.
it's an illusion.
it's not there.
you want to know when he went missing?
it's a long time ago. Who could remember that?
I was at my mother's.
I was sick the entire week. You can ask her.
something else you need to say?
but I was always worried he would not be able to save himself.
he made me strong, but he was weak.
how was he weak?
he allowed his own flesh to be weak.
you know, he let those two, Ryan and Sean, take him to dark places.
you mean the pot?
pot? It was much worse than that.
he let them use him.
use his body.
I mean, he would come back from them begging.
begging for forgiveness.
what would you come back as?
reincarnation.
don't limit yourself. You can choose an animal.
this one time should be plenty. Thank you.
I'd like to come back as a giant Flemish rabbit.
15 pounds of pure bunny.
or a whale.
can you imagine being a whale thousands of feet under water?
can you imagine that?
is it quiet down there?
you need to be on the list.
I bought my ex-wife a horse.
crews, it's really loud in here.
it sounded like you said you bought your ex-wife a horse.
I know you, don't I?
I'm one of the investors.
right.
you want a room with a camera or just a room?
Oh, you brought a friend.
that's cool, so did I.
why don't you go ahead and we'll catch up.
we'll get a room with a camera, okay?
okay.
dating was simpler when I was younger.
this isn't dating.
no, I guess it's not.
that was some party.
I mean, that's the kind of party you dream about your whole life but you very rarely get to see.
I mean, I -- I've never seen it. Have you?
no, mm-mm.
I have never seen a party like that.
she's never seen a party like that because she's kind of shy.
I am.
but also because...
it's just really against the law.
I mean, what did we see in there?
Oh, pimping and pandering.
pandering.
not really sure what that is.
but it usually comes after pimping, and it's not good.
what do you want?
you left some things out this afternoon when we asked you about Tim Chang.
you remember Eric Molina?
we heard from him that things got a little extreme between you and Tim Chang.
isn't that right, boys?
zen master Flash didn't do anything he didn't want to do.
he didn't ask to do.
what did he ask to do?
he was dark, okay?
the guy liked to go all the way down.
he could take a lot of pain, and he liked to have it put on film.
people would pay to see it.
he wanted to do it.
they wanted to see it. But we didn't kill him.
we thought master Flash took off.
figures that freak Molina put you on to us.
he wanted to be just like zen master Flash.
did everything he did.
till that fight. You remember that fight?
that fight was awesome.
I thought zen master was dead the way Eric was hitting him.
when it was over, zen master threw Eric out of the center.
banished him for life.
we weren't even allowed to mention Eric's name.
and if we did, we got thrown out too.
coroner's report confirms that Tim Chang had broken six ribs and one of his hands a month before his death.
it sounds like he'd been in a fight.
I swear it sounded like you said you bought your ex-wife a horse.
it was loud.
also, and I might be wrong about this, but I think people were having sex in that house.
master Chang?
I'm here.
I'm lost.
I know.
how has your relationship with detective Crews changed now that you've become a d.A. ?
Constance Griffiths Ex-Attorney for Charlie Crews
detective Crews and I will always be friends.
but in my role as district attorney I will work with him in the same way that I work with any member of the lapd.
uh, Reese.
you remember assistant district Attorney Griffiths.
no reason to be so formal.
just call me Connie.
good to see you again, Connie.
you too.
I really like your dress.
thank you. I got it in new york.
Constance went to New York.
but then she had to come back from New York.
so now she's not in New York anymore.
I'm saying "New York" a lot, aren't I?
he does that sometimes.
I know. I usually just wait it out.
me too.
can we talk for a minute?
remember the last time I came down here?
I do.
you warned me to stay away from Ames.
I wish you would have listened to me.
I didn't kill him.
we?
the little door.
most homicides that are solved are done so in the first 48 hours.
Jack?
you can explain to me why your detective Crews is no longer a suspect in the carl Ames shooting.
he killed Ames.
he had the motivation.
you find the means and opportunity.
I'm gonna be very careful what I say now, Jack.
I have a witness who reports seeing two men leaving the scene of the Ames killing.
when we find these men, if they connect to Crews, I will go after Crews.
if they connect to somebody else that's who I will go after.
15 years ago this branch of the bank of Los Angeles was held up.
there was a shootout.
$18 million goes missing.
a small group of gunmen could hold out in here forever against the cops out on the street.
the only way to take them out would be with a sniper.
and there's only one place that sniper could take the shot.
I don't like heights.
then don't look down oh, I looked down.
I couldn't help myself.
Oh, I looked down again.
if you want a clean shot of that bank, the only place to do it is from here. Right here.
this is where S.W.A.T. happened to be training the day the bank of Los Angeles was held up.
S.W.A.T. Leader was Jack Reese.
Jack Reese was talking with Ames right before Ames got killed.
I scared Ames. Ames went to Reese.
they were arguing about me. I saw them say my name.
now Ames is dead.
what does the bank of Los Angeles holdup have to do with the detective who put you away?
they both have Jack Reese in common.
Charlie, I'm not Robin, am I?
you know, Batman and Robin.
trusty sidekick.
you mean, like, in tights?
no, Ted.
you are not Robin.
you're not here. Are you?
no, I'm here, Eric.
don't you worry.
why'd you run from us?
cause when you came back I could see you found out I lied to you.
we found out about the fight.
about how you nearly killed Tim Chang.
we found out you got thrown out of the zen center.
master Chang banished you.
and others weren't even allowed to speak your name.
that make you angry, Eric?
that'd make me angry.
is that what you fought about?
we fought about trust.
did he betray your trust?
all I had was master Chang and the zen center.
on my own, who I was, was nothing.
they were -- everything to you.
how did he betray your trust?
was it because of something he was doing himself?
no, what he did to himself, he did somewhere else.
did he do something at the zen center?
the girls that came in that center, they trusted master Chang.
he would take them to his office.
I mean, he broke the trust for pretty girls.
that trust, it was all I had.
all we have is his body.
so you're gonna stay with us awhile until we see if you left anything behind when you buried him.
I didn't kill him.
I loved him.
I wanted to kill him.
Yeah, I tried to kill him.
but I didn't.
I loved him.
if he banished you, how come he called you?
he called to say good-bye.
he said he was leaving.
but wouldn't say why.
you said you were master Chang.
you said you were lost.
just to be clear about this, I am not talking to a dead guy.
I don't talk to dead guys.
I'm talking to myself.
there just -- just happens to be a dead guy here.
the man who killed my friends, the man i served those 12 years for, what do I do when I find him?
okay.
good talking to you.
I'm gonna go find your killer.
Eric thought you were master Chang.
he'd just been hit by a car.
come meditate with me.
that's okay.
I think I'll just watch.
it will make you happy.
it's not gonna make me happy.
if it doesn't make you happy, I promise not to say another word to you for the rest of the day.
where else are you gonna get an offer like that?
all right.
how do I do this?
look straight ahead.
see?
happy?
so everyone going to that zen center was just completely screwed up. Right?
people go there seeking peace.
people seek what they don't have.
only troubled people seek peace.
I've changed my mind.
I want to come back as a panda.
Really?
they're so cute.
they're not cute.
they just seem cute. They're actually very mean.
we just have one thing we need to clear up.
it's not a big thing.
we need to know if you lied to us.
excuse me?
what detective Reese means is when you said did not have a relationship with master Chang, did you lie about the part where you had a relationship with master Chang?
you went to the zen center too, didn't you, Amy?
that's you.
younger, but you, right?
I would drive Luke there.
he's not a very good driver.
his mind is always somewhere else.
I understand that.
detective Reese doesn't let me drive.
we also heard that master chang would take you into his office for a little one on one enlightenment while your professor was out on the mat.
that's not true.
who said that?
who sits in the third chair?
it's a trio.
you and your husband play? -- Yes.
who sits in the third chair? -- My son.
I'd like you to leave.
did your husband Luke know that you were having sex with Tim Chang?
I wasn't. That is a lie.
as a rule, older men get really upset about stuff like that.
is it true that those zen masters know all the secret places?
okay, that's enough. I won't be offended in my own house.
Alec, say hello to detectives Crews and Reese.
hello.
it was a pleasure to meet you.
he is a very respectful child.
Yes. Yes, he is.
how old is he?
just about ten.
may I ask who his birth parents are?
I am his birth mother.
but we had trouble conceiving.
and his father?
it was an anonymous donor.
you understand why we're gonna need to see proof of that.
of course. We have the documents.
and, uh, I'm having trouble with the dates.
maybe you can help me.
exactly how long were you together before you decided to use a donor?
you know who he looks like?
we have master Chang's body.
and we're gonna get a sample of his DNA.
and then -- then we're gonna get a warrant for the DNA of your son.
now, I've had some experience with DNA.
and it's pretty foolproof.
just leave him alone. Just leave us alone.
what is that DNA test gonna prove?
that Alec is your son with Tim Chang?
Alec is who he thinks he is.
he's happy.
why does anyone have to find out -- the truth?
what is the truth?
we met at the point where physics and buddhism came together.
but you understand, after what Chang did, I did what I did.
what did you do, Luke?
if I tell you, you must promise me there will be no DNA testing and no trial.
we can do that.
Alec is my son.
he loves me.
and I will not have him going through life knowing he's the evidence that sent me away.
I killed Tim Chang.
I caught him with Amy.
we would dig behind the zen center.
it was a zen meditation.
dig a hole, fill it up.
I pushed him in one of those.
filled it up.
he was out in the back.
but I was afraid about coyotes, so I brought it in.
Hey, don't get too comfortable.
you're not actually here.
you're talking to the horse.
let me ask you something.
even if something isn't actually there, just more likely to be there, why would you still look for it if you knew where it was?
you're still talking to the horse.
if he knew where he was, why was he still looking for him?
you tell us you killed Tim Chang.
I did.
you killed him, and then you raised Alec?
I love Alec.
I know you do.
but I think you loved Tim Chang too, Luke.
chang was broken.
but he was my zen master.
he helped me to the light.
and when you look at Alec, you seem him there, you see master Chang.
but that -- that's where it bumps for me.
we have these phone records here.
phone records?
Luke has confessed.
why can't you just leave him alone?
to Tim Chang's cell from your house, your office, and your cell.
we talked frequently.
Luke, you made all these calls after he went missing.
cause I was worried about him.
maybe you killed master Chang, Luke, but I think it is more likely that you did not.
because if you knew he was dead, if you knew where he was, why were you still looking for him?
I killed him.
you left something with him, with master Chang.
he was holding something.
what was it?
where are you going?
we're dropping the charges.
but I -- I killed him.
no, you didn't.
so we can go?
actually, you need to go downstairs to children's services.
why do I need to do that?
they're concerned that your house might not be the appropriate environment in which to raise your son in.
because they want to know if Luke here didn't kill master Chang, then who was he protecting with his confession?
because, Amy, you are now the lead suspect in the Tim Chang murder.
will you take care of our son?
a rose.
I threw a rose down there.
that's what he called me.
his rose.
but he thought he could leave me.
and that's where he was wrong.
okay, they're gonna put you back in the ground now.
you take care of yourself.
I'll call you.
Where'd you get this?
you don't wanna know.
you know, you're right. I don't wanna know.
Charlie, this guy was a serious cop.
I mean, look at some of what this guy did.
serious cop with serious friends.
you sure you want to go after him?
Ted, I appreciate your help with this, I do.
if you want to walk away, I understand.
OK,
let me do some financials on Jack Reese.
if you think he was in on the bank of L.A. that money went somewhere.
Yeah, okay.
what are you looking for?
if you want to know how good a cop a cop is, you ask other cops.
you want to know how bad a cop is, you ask his confidential informant.
there.
Jack Reese's registered confidential informant '91 to '96.
let's see what kind of record Kyle has.
it still smells of horse in here.
I kinda like that smell.
that is no surprise.
maybe we could get a dog.
you think we should get a dog, Charlie?
hmm, Charlie?
Charlie, what is it?
Kyle hollis, Jack Reese's informant, there a mug shot here from his last arrest, 1995.
that's the picture Rachel drew.
that's him, Charlie.
that's the killer.
what are you thinking about?
I was thinking about where I'm going next.
if yesterday was thanksgiving and today is christmas, what's tomorrow?
Saturday.
are we going to exchange gifts?
you know, christmas gifts?
some small token of partnership?
I'll check in again with you closer to the big day.
how was your thanksgiving?
my dad's still gone, my mom got drunk, and I did the dishes. You?
Ted made some kind of bird.
it was either a very large chicken or a very small turkey.
maybe a baby turkey.
do they sell those? Baby turkeys?
it tasted like chicken though.
fell from up there someplace.
Yeah, but fell slipped, fell pushed, or fell jumped?
neck snapped. Died instantly.
what do you say? You're the first jumper of the holiday season?
sorry. Sorry.
got me a solid column of the wife's stuffing and gravy starts at my neck runs straight down to my...
well, straight down.
first jumper of the season?
it seems a little early, but you never know.
you get an I.D. on him?
head of mall security.
Dave, these are detectives Crews and Reese.
head of security.
crime scene's all battened down.
good to know that, dave.
do you know this man?
sure. Mitchell Clark. He worked up on the second level.
doesn't seem that far to fall.
not from down here it doesn't.
how well did you know mr. Clark?
I saw him around.
you know, I try to familiarize myself with all the employees for security reasons..
he seem depressed?
that I wouldn't know.
do you think he killed himself?
Oh, I hope he didn't kill himself.
well, if he didn't kill himself, then someone probably pushed him.
you mean killed him?
the world coming to an end?
kind of. It's 6: 00 A. M. The mall's opening.
the mall's opening?
I thought you said you'd secured the crime scene.
well, I put out this yellow tape, but you think I closed the mall?
I can't close the mall. I just work here.
anyway, it's black friday.
biggest shopping day of the year?
hold up! Wait! Wait!
wait, wait, wait! Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no!
stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
the crime scene!
crime scene.
the body's gone?
the body's gone.
it's a miracle.
a genuine miracle.
you know, I lost a girlfriend at a mall once, but it was to the guy who can stand motionless for hours.
so, you know, they had that in common.
but a body, a dead body -- wait a minute.
could it be a christmas miracle?
if someone took the body, they took it for a reason.
perhaps it's all the "everything must go" signs.
probably not.
if someone took a body like that
maybe it was gonna tell us something.
it did tell us something.
it wasn't a suicide.
the killer took the body.
all right, K9, you find the body.
you find the killer, and I'm going to everything-on-a-stick to find some breakfast.
where were you last night?
isn't that the kind of question you ask a suspect?
I was at my sister's.
it was thanksgiving.
and you were there all night?
she lives in Ojai. I slept over.
you can ask her. Or the little brat whose room I took.
came in this morning and sat on my head, full diaper.
Thanksgiving.
Mitchell was scheduled to open for me today.
he's always so punctual, I thought something was wrong.
we need to know where you were last night.
it was thanksgiving. I was with my family. Wasn't everyone?
we need the phone number for the victim's next of kin.
he didn't list anything.
he split with his wife a couple of years ago.
she moved back to Minneapolis or one of those states back there.
there's a rumor that you all lost his body, but I just say that's silly.
you're right. That is silly.
was Mitchell having trouble with anyone at work or in the mall?
he never said anything.
did he have friends here?
well, he didn't think I knew, but I think he was dating Erika from the hat kiosk.
she's way too young for him.
you can't miss her.
she dresses like a tramp.
try lost and found on level two.
heard you're looking for a body.
that's a strange reaction.
yeah? Why's that?
because we heard you were dating Mitchell Clark.
dating the shoe store guy? Who said that?
his manager at sole fix.
Oh, her.
she's just jealous because guys ask about me.
I mean, look at her. Look at me.
where were you last night?
I was off. It was thanksgiving.
ate some turkey with the family?
kind of.
clay and I went to the pocket stop for pot pies and rock-it fuel.
didn't see Mitchell Clark?
I said no.
I'm sure he's got friends his own age.
you should ask him when you find him.
I have to get back to work.
is this store all key chains?
they're called fobs.
fobs? Just fobs?
do you get a lot of repeat business?
clay, did you know Mitchell Clark from the shoe store?
no. I heared you lost the body.
Oh, you heard that, huh?
if there's no body, how do you know someone's dead?
we have a test. It's called the dead test.
Mitchell Clark passed.
Oh, dude, I'd hate to take that test.
clay, do you want some potato chips?
why would I want potato chips?
Oh, it just seems like you might like some.
do you know Erika over there?
Yeah, yeah.
was she dating Mitchell Clark?
the shoe store guy? No. No, I mean, look at her. Look at him.
well, look at him when you find him.
who works over there?
I don't know. - Come on. Thanks.
who doesn't come to work on the busiest shopping day of the year?
have questions? Call Zak Sutter...
is this Zak?
it's detective Crews, the lapd.
Yeah, we saw you weren't at work.
we saw the sign and called you.
we have some questions we'd like to ask you.
he says he's sick. Won't be here until tomorrow.
Hey, hang on. Hang on a minute. You're cutting out.
I see. Okay.
that was mall music.
he's in the mall.
Hey, you don't know the guy who works five feet from you?
no, man, sorry.
kiosk people kind of come and go.
don't know him.
you lose him too?
he's here someplace.
Yeah, but it's the seventh largest mall in the world.
I heard it was the fifth.
can you show me how you do that thing when you block the caller I. D.?
your dad still gone?
Yep.
maybe he'll come back.
or maybe he won't, and then I'll finally get what I want for christmas.
I'd say so.
I guess he didn't see the sign.
guess he didn't see that one either.
good place to hide a body down here.
okay, okay. Who are you?
I'm detective Crews.
I spoke to you on the phone, Zak.
anything here you want to show us?
no, no, no, no--wait, wait, wait! Don't open that!
let me tell you something.
when I grew up, the idea that the mayor of Los Angeles would call me his friend was not something a kid like me would dream about.
but I've been lucky here.
lucky to have been a police officer for the city of los angeles.
how does an ex-cop get that kind of money?
maybe he worked for it.
and holds land all over the city, three hotels, owns a big piece of that development going up in the marina.
owns the afina ghting franchise.
we should go to a match.
and now if somebody will just give me a shovel, I'll show you.
Charlie, isn't that your ex-wife?
what is she doing here?
I don't know.
well, maybe we should go.
what are you doing here?
it was ted's idea.
something about a tax deduction. What about you?
me? Oh, you can't imagine how many of these things we have to go to.
we?
my husband.
he's around here somewhere on a call.
I got a car. It has a back seat.
it got-- it got shot up.
I mean, I shot it up, but, you know, it still drives.
what do you want, Charlie?
what do you want to do?
I want to go back.
back where?
there.
I want to go back there.
Yeah. But we can't go back.
because we're here now. - Yes.
I know. We're here now.
Charlie, I have to find my husband.
agent Bodner?
we need to talk, but not here.
your father died of cancer, october 2007.
your mother in a car accident a month later.
you and Carin were supposed to enter foster care.
they don't know us.
you can't become Carin's legal guardian until you're 21.
you plan to live in the mall for the next four years?
I have a job there.
I can take care of her.
Zak, did you know Mitchell Clark? - No.
I heard you lost the body though.
bet your boss is pretty mad about that.
when the mall closed down last night, did you hear anything unusual or see anything?
when we're in our room, we stay in our room.
Really? You have the mall to yourselves. I'd go out.
well, that's you.
when can I talk to my sister?
how long have you and your brother been living at the mall?
since your mom died?
Yeah.
Carin, you know you can't live at a mall, don't you?
I have Zak.
he's a good brother.
what about my things?
your things are at the mall, and we'll have them brought to you.
brought to me?
Why? Where am I going?
I want to go home.
what's it like, living in the mall?
well, it's the second largest mall in the world, so, you know, a dream come true.
Zak, what's it like living in the mall?
well, it's the second largest mall in the world, so, you know, a dream come true.
Yeah.
okay, Zak, you know the state's gonna want to hold you.
because we're minors.
because you're minors. Because you were trespassing.
and, Zak, because a man died.
so we might need to talk to you again.
when can I see my sister?
I'll call children's services to take custody.
they're children. I have to call children's services.
they wanted to split them up.
who wanted to split what up?
those kids.
children's services would have separated them.
after their parents died, they ran.
all they've got is each other.
I still have to call them.
unless someone wants to ask me to do them a personal favor.
all right. I'll see if I can find somebody to track down a relative.
while they wait here.
detective Reese-- are we still on for dinner?
only if you never say it out loud again.
tidwell.
they were living in a mall.
for almost a year.
lived right here, in a mall.
he was taking care of his sister.
you know, not a lot of kids would do that.
Yeah, but if two kids have been living here unnoticed, what else is going on?
let's split up.
Crews? Did you go shopping?
it's black friday, Reese.
everything's on sale.
man, my dogs are tired.
I thought we were supposed to find out what else was going on here.
Oh, I found out a lot of things.
I found out you really can't get everything at everything-on-a-stick.
you can get papaya, which some people think tastes like barf.
I don't.
Oh, the girl at the bubbles told me you shouldn't wash your face with soap.
did you know that?
all my life I've washed my face with soap.
the guy in the bookstore, he told me that in four days I could learn to speak dutch.
four days, Reese.
by tuesday, what I'm saying to you now, I could say to you in dutch.
Oh, the woman at opticals told me that with the shape of face you have, you should be wearing these frames.
put them on.
how does she know the shape of my face?
I described you.
by tuesday, I could describe you in dutch. Put them on.
she was right. They do look good.
you're what they call a "pinched ovoid."
don't take it personally. Did you get me anything?
the girl at lola's, she told me
I don't think I want to know this.
no, you do.
the girl at lola's told me that the dead shoe store guy and the hat kiosk girl are in there a lot, together.
together together?
together together.
so clay and Erika lied to us about knowing Mitchell.
let's go to the kiosks.
no, they're working at the gift wrap hut. I saw them there today.
do you want these?
they have a patented breathability patch. Microfibers.
I can't return them. You can't return underwear.
it's about time.
these things are heavy.
just get in the back. These people need their presents wrapped.
he says they're fighting about fruitcake.
there's no fight about fruitcake. Everyone hates fruitcake.
it's fruit and it's cake. What's not to like?
that it's the heaviest substance known to man?
what did you just say?
that I hate it?
no, the other thing.
if I gave you one of these, would you wrap it up and give me back an x-box?
because we think people are giving you x-boxes, and you're handing them back fruitcake.
now what kind of holiday spirit is that?
bad elf.
Hi, Charlie.
Hi, Jen.
this place looks exactly the same.
exactly. Right?
remember the night your dad caught us here?
I remember how nervous you were the first time we checked in.
no, I wasn't nervous.
Yes, you were.
I was too.
I thought you said we couldn't go back.
we can go back tonight.
who did this to us, Charlie?
I don't know.
but you're gonna find them?
Yeah.
I loved you, Charlie.
so much.
I loved you too, Jen.
the fruitcake gag, you think it up?
kid wakes up christmas morning, opens up a box of delicious fruitcake.
who wouldn't like that?
that's a lot of fruitcake.
you don't want to go down for the full freight on this.
full freight? - Homicide.
you mean murder?
that's what it means.
for Mitchell Clark's murder?
you're trying to trick me.
well, Mitchell's alive. I know that for a fact.
how do you know that, clay?
Oh, look at all this stolen merchandise we found at your apartment, Erika.
my partner and I, we work robbery/homicide.
but there's a little play in the robbery charge, as long as it helps us solve a homicide.
there is no homicide.
Mitchell isn't dead.
he is.
you had a relationship with him you don't want to talk about.
this is all about hurting Mitchell.
that won't happen.
Mitchell cares about us.
you don't care about us.
maybe he cared about you, Erika, but not anymore.
Mitchell Clark is alive.
they swear he's not dead.
this is why we like to have a body in these situations.
it helps keep things simple.
are you liking that?
there is a distinct possibility that this isn't fruit or cake.
they mean it when they say he's not dead.
but he is dead.
Yeah, he is.
but they mean it when they say he's not dead.
so... he's Risen? He's elvis?
what?
don't you "what" me.
the kids. Where's Zak and Carin?
it's been a full day.
detective, a police station is no place for kids.
back me up on this, Crews.
I'm gonna be switzerland here.
they had nazi gold.
you sent them to children's services.
I couldn't find a relative.
there wasn't anybody who wants them.
detective, they are children.
children's services are where they need to be.
now, I've got two thieves in there.
and from all that swag, it looks like they've been at it for quite a while.
and a good guess is that the dead guy who they lied about not knowing was a thief too.
so I'm waiting for you two to tell me who killed him.
fruitcake?
Reese, come on.
how would you get rid of me?
tidwell said find the killer, not the body.
you do everything tidwell says?
the question isn't who killed him.
it is if you're homicide cops, which we are.
no, the question is why do they think he's not dead?
come on, it's weird, right?
to think he's not dead?
you're sCaring the children.
Reese, come on.
how would you get rid of my body?
would you put me in one of these big boxes like a present?
they've been searched.
would you cut me up into tiny pieces?
no blood, no knife, no time.
would you drag me across the parking lot and put me in the trunk of your car?
that's a long way to go with a body.
you know, if I want to get rid of you, I'd put you in the nearest store.
but the cadaver dogs have been through the mall and didn't find anything.
maybe they didn't find anything 'cause there's too much there.
you like goldfish?
no. What did you find out?
K9 didn't bring the dogs into here.
said there's too much animal scent to get a hit.
the uniforms have scheduled a visual search.
they haven't done it yet?
Hey, Reese, ever had a bunny?
cedar chips in the cage.
smells like a walk in the woods.
Mitchell Clark, there you are.
Yeah, but who put him there?
black friday we did not open at 6 A. M.
what time did you open?
no one wants a lizard at 6 A. M. No one.
and where were you?
Thanksgiving, I was with my family.
isn't everyone?
who has access to the store?
the owner, in tahiti.
my partner, in rehab.
security.
security. - Dave.
what do you want for christmas? What do you mean you don't know? How can you not know? Come on.
moonlighting?
Oh, I do this every year.
I like to spread a little cheer.
now, you'll have to wait your turn like good boys and girls, detectives.
Hey, santa, guess what?
we just got an early christmas present.
Oh, what's that?
Mitchell Clark's body.
in the cedar chips, back of paws and claws.
well, I'd imagine that'd be a big help to your investigation.
it is.
Yeah, see, the store was closed, but guess who had the access code?
as the head of security, I can assure you that 18 people have access to that store.
come on, son.
and we've already established where I was when Mitchell went off that balcony.
and of course, I was with you when he went missing.
this isn't-- is this real?
it's real.
but he was here. You had him.
who told you that?
Erika, who told you Mitchell was still alive?
that we had him? - Was it dave?
were you stealing from Mitchell?
we all were.
then, friday morning, Mitchell was gone.
Dave said you had him.
that if we did what he said, Mitchell would get out and come back to us.
so we did what dave said. I...
I did what Dave said.
you want to tell us about Mitchell?
I'd do anything for him.
everyone would.
anything he said, ever since I left home.
he was everything.
how old were you when you left home?
young.
and Mitchell was everything.
and you did what he said too?
Erika, how old were you when he started with you?
too young.
do you know who killed him, Erika?
could Dave have done it?
Dave is the one that likes to keep everybody in line for Mitchell.
Dave liked to do that.
keep people in line.
except for Zak.
Zak isn't like the rest of us.
he and his sister.
Dave was worried Zak would talk.
I found the aunt. The kids' aunt. In phoenix.
remarried, changed her name. See that? Happy ending.
Yeah, this is detective Reese. You have a Carin sutter.
she came in with her older brother Zak.
Yeah. Okay. I got it.
they're gone.
they jumped out of the car at a stop light.
carin and her brother, they're--they're gone.
we'll find them. We'll put out an amber alert and we'll find them.
Dani-- detective, we will find them.
Dave was worried Zak would talk.
what if he finds them first?
carin wanted to go home.
she just wanted to go home.
it's so stupid. So stupid. Stupid!
if you run, you'll only die tired.
I really wanted to shoot him.
no, you just really wanted to shoot someone.
no, he would have done just fine.
watch your head.
where did that blood come from, Dave?
I cut myself.
Carin, it's okay.
Where's Zak?
Carin? Come here.
Where's your brother?
don't!
Carin, it's okay. Let it go.
we can book dave for the assault, but not for the murder.
because the killer's right here.
is he going to hurt my brother?
no.
no. No, sweetie, he's not.
Hey, Dave swears he's not good for the killing.
he said he hid the body so it looked like Mitchell was still alive, but did not kill him.
and get this, when I asked him how he got the body across the floor without being seen, Dave told me he took the dead guy's arm, put it around his shoulder, and walked him out.
weekend at bernie-ish.
everyone was looking for the sales, no one even noticed.
I got something else too.
Yeah, what's that?
the kids' aunt.
she'd been looking for them.
she wants to take them home.
time for you to go home.
but what about Zak?
when we came in before, down there, your sister, with that stick, she protected you.
you protect her too.
don't you, Zak?
we protect each other.
Yeah, but you're the big brother.
you're the man, Zak. Right?
we know what Mitchell did to Erika.
we know how old Erika was when Mitchell started in with her.
you protected your sister.
you protected Carin, so Mitchell would not do that to her.
I did what I had to do.
you know, I--I-- I had to stop him. He had her.
so I chased him up the stairs, and he was right next to the railing.
and he tripped. - No, he didn't.
he tripped and fell.
right over the railing.
there was nothing you could do.
sometimes people just fall.
Hey, that looks like your aunt over there.
let me get you up.
how about that body?
what?
the one you and your partner found in the pet store. That was good work.
Thanks.
you don't mind if I--? - No, no. I don't mind.
I, um, I thought you weren't coming.
because of the kids.
because I, uh, sent the kids to children's services.
I thought you'd be pissed.
well, that was the job.
the job's the job.
you did what you had to do.
so, you know, let's just leave it back there.
all right. Good for you. The job's the job.
Yep, that's the way I like to do it.
some people, though, they can't-- they can't leave it back there, you know?
they have to take it home with them.
runs around in their mind all night long.
me, I just-- I leave it at work.
but someone like that, they'd probably be pretty pissed off at someone like me.
you okay?
you know what? I am pissed.
you know something?
you look a lot bigger from the side.
Hi, this is Jennifer.
I'm not here right now, but please leave a message for me for when I am here.
special agent Bodner.
federal Bureau of Investigation.
what happened to homeland security?
I was just on loan there.
now I'm back where I belong.
who shot your car?
I did.
you did?
my partner helped.
Yeah. Okay.
is this the part where you tell me there's something I should know?
Yeah, what you should know is that I know you want mickey Rayborn.
and that's not gonna happen.
are the FBI investigating him or protecting him?
sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
but if you want Rayborn, you'd have to come at us.
and if you come at us, you'll find yourself and no ginchy little civil rights lawyer is gonna get you out this time.
gum?
Thanks.
tropical fruit?
it's the only kind I chew.
would you like one? - No.
come on, I'm real good at 'em.
you want me to give you one?
that's my name.
it'd be confusing if your name was my name.
okay, Reese.
your initials are D. R.
that's good.
D. R. Is good.
D. R. Stands for doctor. And there you have it. Couldn't be better.
D. R. Is doctor. Doctor is "doc." Doc Reese. Instant classic.
doc is a great name. I wish I had that name. Doc!
might be confusing if we both had the same nicknames.
no gunshot.
no signs of trauma.
can you help me roll him over?
stab wounds. No blood.
gone about 12 hours on the outside.
you think he od'd?
he sure dressed for it.
he was in that band that played here last night.
rock and Roll, huh?
no track marks. He looks healthy.
healthy except for being dead.
well, I guess not that healthy.
you think maybe he just died?
people do do that, don't they? People do just die.
we should run a tox screen.
Yeah, we should run one. But...
But?
his makeup's smeared.
well, he probably had a long night.
no, look closer.
well, it's smeared in one direction like...like he pressed against something.
or something pressed against him.
plastic wrap.
well, what's that it's got on it?
I don't know. It looks like... - Makeup?
here, take the corners. Carefully.
wow, it's like a death mask.
someone held this over his face pgd suffocated him.
well, maybe he didn't just die.
crews. Hot lead?
they're a cover band.
remember a group called heavy caliber? - No.
from the '80s? - No.
looked a lot like this?
I really wasn't into guys with wigs.
well, hot lead was a heavy caliber cover band.
lead singer, Mitch Wagner. I talked to the guy at the door.
they sold this place out.
last four nights too.
singing someone else's music.
all those people came to watch him pretending to be someone else.
killer comes up behind him, pulls this over his face.
you think this is the last thing he saw?
no.
his breath would have fogged up the plastic.
he wouldn't have seen anything at the end.
the show ended, the band left, the place was locked up.
cleaning crew comes in this morning and finds the lead singer up on the stage.
the victim's wife was in San Diego.
she's on her way back now.
the piece of plastic he was suffocated with?
no fingerprints on it. Waiting for DNA.
the band left together.
we're on our way now to go talk to the other three.
heavy caliber cover band.
I saw heavy caliber play the garden once.
the lead singer was a "Jude" something.
Jude Hays? - Yeah, jude hays.
died in london. Drank himself to death, right?
I really don't remember.
doc wasn't into guys with wigs.
D. R. Is...
doctor. Doc. Doc Reese.
what's the matter with her?
I don't know.
doc's a great name. I wish I had that name.
it would be confusing.
you're probably right.
you all left together last night?
after the show.
and then?
Hal and I went to a party.
and after the party?
Eric and I went to an after party.
and after the after party?
was there an after after party after the after party?
no, after the after party, we went home... together.
good show last night. - Standing room only.
you have a lot of fans.
Mitch had a lot of fans.
when he was dressed like Jude Hays.
it wasn't just the costume.
I mean, when Mitch picked up that mike and stepped up in front of the crowd...
he was Jude Hays?
sometimes it felt that way.
it feel that way last night?
when you left last night, had Mitch taken off his costume?
we don't go around dressed like heavy caliber.
we'd all changed.
Why? How was he dressed when you found him?
he shouldn't be much longer.
Dr. Stanton. There's a detective here to see you.
Oh, why don't you come on back.
go ahead and open wide for me.
open wide?
your mouth.
let me have a quick look, then I'll take your history, then I'll get you into the chair.
Dr. Stanton, I'm a detective.
Yes.
and there will be the standard police discount.
I'm a homicide detective.
homicide?
so this is not about your dental needs.
anyone you can think of that would have wanted to harm Mitch?
Tyler Sims. Our first singer.
your first...
so Tyler Sims was Jude Hays before Mitch was Jude Hays?
what happened to Tyler?
had to ask him to leave.
because of what happened in Fresno.
what happened in Fresno?
it was terrible. The fans went psycho.
they threw things. They came onstage. They went after tyler.
well, they went after all of us.
what made them so angry?
Tyler. He sang his own song.
he sang his own song?
he sang his own song.
not a heavy caliber cover song?
no, one he wrote himself.
and so the fans felt betrayed.
because he wasn't Jude Hays anymore.
and so you asked him to leave.
we're hot lead!
we're the heavy caliber cover band. That's who we are. That's what they want.
how did Tyler take it when you asked him to leave the band?
mm, not good.
and when you hired the new singer?
it just got worse.
Tyler showed up at a gig dressed as Jude.
came at Mitch, broke two of his ribs.
when did you last see Tyler?
night he attacked Mitch.
he did time for it. Four months.
have you seen Tyler since he got out of jail?
doc, can I ask you about these marks on your wall?
the original bassist for heavy caliber, before the band broke up he bedded 4, 378.
bedded? So you are
just being true to the music.
where were you after the show?
with a new friend.
we'll be needing her name.
of course.
detective, I have some time before my next patient.
shall I uncap the sharpie?
no. Do not uncap the sharpie.
okay, I'll wait for it.
uncap the sharpie? By that he meant
his sharpie, Crews.
he was planning on uncapping it.
right there in the office?
okay, got it. Thanks.
okay.
hot lead's first singer, Tyler Sims, did four months out in county for that assault on Mitch Wagner.
got out six months ago.
and since then?
there's no record on him.
no dmv, no dwp, no land lines, no cell phones.
so Tyler Sims gets thrown out of the band for not being Jude Hays enough.
then He goes missing.
maybe if he couldn't be Jude Hays he didn't want to be at all.
grown men in wigs and make-up...
pretending to be other grown men in wigs and make-up.
the buddha said we live our lives pretending to be someone else.
Oh, he said that, did he?
who did the buddha pretend to be.
he was the buddha.
okay, I know you're pretty sure you're not pretending to be someone else.
but maybe, Reese, maybe you're pretending to be yourself.
how could I pretend to be myself?
maybe the buddha was pretending to be the buddha.
that makes sense.
and maybe Tyler Sims was pretending to be a killer and pulled that plastic wrap around Mitch Wagner's face.
but we can't find Tyler Sims, so let's look for Jude Hays.
celebrity impersonators.
birthday parties, singing telegrams.
if you can't be in the cover band but you need to be Jude Hays, you do this.
these ads list Jude Hays as one of the impersonations they do.
and they come right to your door.
do we know that one?
Yeah, I think we do.
Hey, we know you. Don't we?
no, you don't know me.
is that Tyler Sims?
no, it's not. It's someone else.
I'm gonna go. I don't know what you're into here, but, uh, I don't do it.
that's who you are.
Yeah, you're that girl.
what girl?
tell 'em what girl.
last year when we were auditioning for a new lead singer, she showed up.
well, we know she didn't get the job. Did she get to audition?
she's a girl. And we're hot lead.
so what? I can't be Jude Hays?
no.
you know what happened at the Mayan last night?
someone killed Mitch Wagner.
you know anything about it?
I know you called my service asking for a singing telegram.
I know that was a lie.
and I know I'm out of here.
it's always a pleasure every time I see you two.
what happened last time you saw her?
at the audition we laughed at her...
when we saw who she was.
how come you didn't mention her when we asked if there was anyone who would want to harm Mitch?
I guess we forgot all about her.
well, we know how to find her.
ma'am, can we help you?
are you detectives Crews and Reese?
Yes, we are.
you're Emma Wagner.
we're very sorry for your loss, Ma'am.
you didn't have to come to us. We'd have come to you.
I was too afraid to stay home.
why were you afraid?
do you know who Tyler Sims is?
Mitch replaced him in hot lead and then Tyler assaulted Mitch.
has Tyler done something else?
he called me. - When?
about an hour ago.
what did he say?
he said he understood.
he said Mitch was Jude Hays and he was Jude Hays too.
so if I wanted, he'd come over and sing.
Emma, what phone did he call on?
my home phone.
do you mind if we run a trace on that number, Emma?
no.
no one named Tyler Sims works here.
we traced a call from here this morning.
you want to double check?
I know all my employees, ma'am.
he works here.
but his name isn't Tyler Sims. It's...
Jude Hays? - Yeah.
I thought he was goofing on me when we hired him.
shows me his driver's license. Jude Hays.
like the singer, died in the auto wreck in Mexico.
six billion people on the planet. There's got to be more than one Jude Hays.
is your Jude Hays here today?
Jude Hays, we're looking for Tyler Sims.
you seen him around?
you called Mitch Wagner's house, talk to his wife?
there a law against that?
not against that there isn't.
I just wanted her to know.
know what?
her husband had Jude's voice. I got it too.
if she was missing it, I might sing to her.
where were you last night, Tyler?
where were you last night, Jude?
home asleep.
I work real hard and when I get home, I just conk out.
you didn't happen to kill Mitch Wagner before you conked out?
Yes, I did. God, you're good.
he did take your dream job away.
if you were Jude and Mitch was Jude, well you couldn't both be Jude.
so maybe one of you had to go.
we could both be Jude.
plenty of jude to go around.
Yeah, but you changed your name.
so you were a little more Jude than Mitch was.
did it legal. Went to the courthouse. It was kind of like getting married.
you want to tell us what happened in Fresno?
not particularly. - Crowd got ugly.
they were small-minded.
they came to hear Jude Hays.
you gave 'em one of your songs.
no, I gave them a Jude Hays song.
but you wrote that song, not Hays.
that was the song Jude Hays would've written if he had lived.
I gave that crowd a new Jude Hays song.
but they were small-minded.
I get paid by the hour. So if you're done, I gotta get back to work.
okay, thanks.
the telegram girl's name is Patty York.
and that's not her only job.
she works at the box office at the Mayan theater.
she has a master key that opens all the doors.
asian pear. Looks like an apple, but it's not.
also known as a sand pear, apple pear, papple.
Papple?
or bapple.
Patty York? - You remember us?
sure. You're those cops that called me to that house to sing.
you always wanted to be Jude Hays?
Yes. My mom was sort of a groupie.
do you want some, uh, soda or a cigarette?
I think I have some cigarettes here.
no, thank you. We're okay.
you didn't tell us you worked here at the Mayan, Patty.
I'm sorry. Was I supposed to?
that was stupid. I should've told you that.
of course you'd want to know that.
you mind if we ask you about when you auditioned for hot lead last year?
those two tell you what happened?
they did.
what did they say?
they said they laughed at you.
I guess they did.
you worked her at the Mayan, yet they never saw you here?
bands go in and out the back.
you don't want a soda or some cheese?
I think I brought some cheese.
you have a key to the back door, right?
you're here because you think I killed that guy because they wouldn't let me in their band?
that and because you work right where the murder happened.
I work here because it's where heavy caliber played whenever they were in LA.
I got a bootleg, live at the Mayan.
you can hear my mom in the background hollering, "turn it up!"
Patty, you use a lot of plastic.
germs. You gotta be careful.
well, there's nothing in that plastic there. What's that for?
there's plastic in that plastic.
for leftovers?
gotta be careful.
we're gonna take some of this plastic with us, okay?
where were you last night, Patty?
home with Winston, my rabbit.
the cheese is his.
what does it mean to take a life?
it means that life is now yours.
all that it was, all that it could've been.
if you do not want it, then you should not take it.
dad.
how's your bullet wound?
Oh, you know, healing up.
how's yours?
healing up.
Ted, this is my, uh, father.
what are you doing here, Dad?
I'm looking for Olivia.
why are you looking here?
I thought she might come to see you.
to see me?
why would she come to see you?
she left me. Olivia called off the wedding and walked out.
Oh, that's... that's terrible.
Yeah.
why'd she walk out on you, Dad?
because of you.
because of me?
what the hell are you talking about?
she left me because of you.
because of me? - Because of you?
does he really have to be here?
Ted, could you...would you mind?
you know.
you two live together?
why'd she walk out on you, Dad?
because of whatever it is that you and I are doing, she says she can't take it anymore.
and until we resolve things, the wedding is off.
your last name. Earley?
Earley. Yeah. I know that name. Ted Earley.
you a friend of Olivia's?
so many different kinds of friend.
which kind are you?
this is not the way to resolve things.
okay, you want to resolve things?
you never said sorry for shooting me.
no. Never did.
you're a real tough guy, aren't you?
apple in the tree. You know?
what does he mean by he's a friend of Olivia's?
I mean... - Ted.
I love her.
Oh, here we go. - You what?
what kind of a house is this?
you gonna shoot me too? - Hello.
what?
your credit card got billed for last time I was here so it turns out I do owe you a song.
probably not the best time.
maybe one of you can give me a ride back to the bus stop. It's a hike.
that guy was your Dad?
Yes.
and who shot him?
I shot him.
why is your car full of bullet holes?
I shot it.
you sure shoot a lot of things.
maybe you should be in hot lead.
you really come tonight to sing?
look, I know I'm a suspect.
that a rabbit isn't an alibi.
but I want to help find Mitch's killer.
because he was Jude Hays and you're Jude Hays too?
no. Because he was a human being.
the plastic we took from you doesn't match the plastic that killed Mitch.
so does that mean I'm not a suspect?
no. It means the plastics don't match.
you wanna find out what goes on around the theater at night, you should talk to Al.
Hey, Al.
okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
okay. Got me.
what are you doing?
I'm not stealing.
Oh, yeah? It sure looked like you were.
well, it's...it's just stuff that people left out there in public.
It's...it's...it's valuable stuff.
but they...they left it, so it's...it's not stealin'.
he's got a point. You get anything good?
sure did. Got a gold lighter.
and banana bread.
with chocolate chips?
hadn't tasted it yet.
Patty told us if we want to know what goes on around here, we should talk to you.
well, I, you know, see a few things every now and again.
you ever see this guy?
no.
you're asking me 'cause that hair band guy got himself killed, huh?
and so you know, I didn't see Patty that night either.
you see somebody down here, Al?
you were taking food from a dead guy's shine, so maybe you can help catch his killer.
I saw him go in the back door.
the victim. Was he alone?
no. I saw him go in too.
you sure you saw him?
he had real white teeth.
so I remembered.
and he came out by himself.
can I go get my banana bread now?
the dentist didn't mention that he came back with Mitch Wagner the night he was killed.
you must be Dr. Sharpie.
auditions for a new cover band?
your buddy isn't even in the ground and you're moving on.
Where's your candle in the wind, pal?
auditioning new singers isn't really breaking the law.
we got a witness that puts him in the theater at the time of the killing.
whoever said that's a liar.
I mean, we're all liars.
to be honest, that was a lie.
found these in his bass case.
"for relief of pain," "for relief of pain," "for relief of pain."
you're in a lot of pain.
they're for my patients.
Yeah, they all have different names on them.
different girls' names.
we're gonna hold onto them.
and you, while we run this down, let's go.
auditions.
why would you wanna be a guy who was shot to death?
drank his way out. In london.
shot to death in Rome.
by that fashion model?
Yeah, that's right. - No, no, no, no, no. That was the other guy.
no, it was Jude Hays. Went through his grave when I was in Italy.
when were you in Italy?
when, uh, you were in prison. His wife's idea.
how was it? - Hot.
prison too.
drank himself to death.
okay.
I'm sure he drank himself to death.
and you talking about people drinking themselves to death really isn't helping me study.
Oh, because of you and, um
Yeah, because of me and
I'm just gonna go to bed.
I do love you.
of course I love you.
how could you ask me that?
I will always love you.
but you have to know it's not you, it's me. Okay.
I'm gonna say good-bye now.
you don't have to do this.
if you're not coming with me, I don't think I wanna go there.
come to bed.
I'm not done with this.
come to bed.
I'm not done with you either.
you ruined it for me.
I had a perfectly good nickname for partner, and now I wanna call you Doc, and, you know
that just ruins it.
found these in your car.
we got a warrant, a witness said seeing you at the murder scene.
it's the kind of thing the D. A. Likes to hear.
I left with the band. I didn't come back that night.
there's a different name on each of those bottles.
I told you, they're for... - Your patients.
but we checked. - These women don't exist.
you're writing prescriptions for pain killers, good pain killers too.
for women that don't exist.
now, what kind of pain could a woman that doesn't exist be in?
you know, I've been thinking about all those marks on your wall, Doc, about all those women and you, and...you say it?
about uncapping your sharpie.
you use these to sweeten the deal, and then Mitch Wagner finds out about that you've been trading pills for sex and
I may have been a tad liberal with my prescription pad.
but I didn't kill Mitch.
I have an alibi.
Yeah, she said she was with you.
but, you know, now we're thinking her memory might be in question, Doc.
even if your alibi holds, you're still gonna get five years for the pills.
longer if one of the women brings charges.
something you two should see.
the DNA came back on this.
the victim's saliva and skin are all over it, which makes sense.
there was, however, also unknown saliva, so
it was used to kill someone else.
or the killer tried it on first.
just to see how it felt.
get DNA from all the suspects.
your name may be Jude Hays, but we need a sample from Tyler Sims.
so put the torch down, and lift up your mask.
Jude said he needed some time off.
he say where he was spending it?
he did not.
you got his cell phone on file?
let me go grab it for you.
you think he'll pick up when we call?
no. Not when we call.
here you go, Mrs. Wagner.
I thought about what you said.
hands in the air.
we're gonna need a little sample from you, Tyler.
why do you need a sample from me?
what the hell is that?
that's what got wrapped around Mitch Wagner's head.
what's this on it?
it's got a few things on it.
it's got Mitch on it.
it's got someone else on it too.
that's why we need a sample from you.
this is what killed him?
it's okay, you can touch it.
looks like a mask.
I need to get something from my house.
what's that, Tyler?
fan mail.
fan mail?
fan mail.
girls send their panties to the lead singer of a cover band?
when are you gonna just put those back on the table?
they're probably used.
just put them down.
I should have been a rock star.
and the band would be?
lots of love letters.
everyone loved tyler...I mean, Jude.
cause that's who they're addressed to.
not everyone. Got one here addressed to Tyler.
your face is not his face.
your face is a lie.
take it off.
any return address?
postmarked to central post office.
got something else in here.
no makeup on that.
this must have been the warning.
but somebody has been stalking hot lead for a while.
maybe they love to trail.
okay.
so we have all the ticket lists coming in from all the theaters where hot lead played.
but if the stalker were going to the shows, he probably didn't use his real name.
or even the same name twice.
cause if there was a stalker in the crowd, I need to ask the crowd.
it's you.
you take a good picture, you know that?
very photogenic.
I can send this to you right off of here.
and you could print it.
or I can just erase it.
I'll just erase it.
I, uh, did what you asked.
I got in touch with other hot lead fans.
what you want is in there.
concert photos close to the stage.
well, they would have wanted to be close.
someone who looks like a fan, but is really obsessed.
bapple.
Bapple?
or papple.
don't ask.
Do...do you know who you're looking for?
well, it could be anyone, really.
it could be you, Patty.
but it's not.
it's... Al.
here too, in this one.
Yeah, he's here too.
Al...but that's not possible.
he...he's just Al.
where were these pictures taken, Patty?
uh, this is Seattle, this is San Diego, this one is New York.
where would a homeless guy get the money to follow a cover band all over the country?
why'd you take the cards?
from the shrine.
I get the banana bread, the cashsh.
I get the lighters, the bracelets.
but why take the cards?
they're not worth anything.
but they were written to Jude Hays.
that's right. They are.
Oh, so they belong to you?
you know, we got something else that belongs to you
a piece of plastic with a dead man's face on it.
we're gonna need a DNA Sample from you.
his face was a lie, so he had to take it off?
what about your face?
no.
my face is not a lie.
my face is rock and roll.
all right. Let's take it easy, okay?
okay. Okay.
they sing like him. They look like him. But they are not him.
They...they...they...they
they are a lie.
al, I need you to help me out with something for a moment.
there's some confusion at the station.
yeah? About what?
about how Jude Hays died.
everyone seems to have a different version.
so maybe you can help me out.
how exactly did Jude Hays go?
was it in a plane crash?
did he O. D. ?
was he stabbed by that model?
he didn't die. Did he?
no, he didn't.
he's been here the whole time.
how did you get Mitch back here that night?
with all his makeup on?
you told him who you were.
rock and roll, baby.
rock and roll.
good night, L. A.
do you really think that's Jude Hays?
how are you gonna prove it?
there's a Jude Hays shirt in the rock and roll hall of fame.
from a concert he did in Tokyo that took six hours.
six hours? That's a lot of sweat.
that's a lot of DNA.
that's a lot of hate.
what?
Charlie, about me and your father and your father's fiancee, Olivia
if you love her, Ted, you should tell her.
just stop telling me about her.
so the real Jude Hays, living in that alley.
eh, just spending time there.
he kept a bunch of hotel rooms in different names all over the city.
and those other two, Tyler and Patty, formed their own band?
Yeah. The two Judes.
I'm proud of you. Proud of you, Charlie.
you don't need to be driving a car with bullet holes in it.
you sure she's gonna show?
well, she said she'd be here.
but you know women.
no, not really.
neither do I.
is that...
my car?
looks like...
my car.
what did she do to it?
she painted it, Ted.
why would she do that?
this is your car. The one you gave me.
I just painted some flowers on it.
it's the same underneath.
say something.
bapple.
I'm sorry, I thought you guys just said "Africa.
south Africa. For a year.
it's a chance for us all to get closer as a family.
who's family, his or ours?
we're all one family now.
we went to stay with my grandfather at his lodge.
welcome to the Blue Antelope.
we're staying here?
it's not easy running a bed and breakfast.
I'm eager to help and I'd love to bring it out of retirement.
there's a goat that won't survive a couple of days.
he needs a vet.
you are the vet.
he is.
you must be the doctor's daughter.
I'm... I'm Tumelo.
the doctor's daughter.
now this is what I call a lodge.
Mara caters to tourists.
thought you might like it.
I'm Oliver, this is my sister Emily.
you two brother and sister?
well, her lunatic father duped my mother into marrying him.
Yeah, that's exactly how it went down.
it's paradise. You can do what you want whenever you want.
after the rockiest of starts, it almost started to feel like home.
they say you never get a second chance to make a first impression.
good, no pressure there.
today is my first day at a new school in a new country on a new continent.
I get to make friends...
mand definitely make impressions.
africa.
I would like to propose a toast...
dad, you're not serious.
I'm very serious.
...to your first day of school, to my first day at work.
let's all get a fresh start as a family here in Africa.
to new beginnings.
and I'm waiting.
God, that was moving.
mom, can't breathe.
okay, I'm sorry. Okay, you look great. Get on that bus.
so, new teachers, new classes, new students. You nervous?
well, now I am. No, I'm fine. Just, this skirt's itchy.
skirt's great. You look great.
I'm wearing knee highs and a pleated skirt. I look like Lolita.
honey, honey, stop. Stop.
africa is different. But you are not.
you just got to...
embrace it. I know. The day will be easy. School I do well.
it's the one thing I have on resume.
it's just the skirt I have an issue with.
Bye.
Bye, guys. - Be good. We love you.
excellent behavior. All right?
Bye-bye!
Oh, my gosh.
we just became those parents.
it was only a matter of time.
Hi. Can you point me to room 124?
Hi. Can you just point me to room 124?
you, uh, you seem a bit confused.
Yeah, it's just... this school
relax, it's first day jitters.
allow me to be your official tour guide.
Oh, you're hired.
can we start by why does no one speak English?
I thought this was an international school.
each month, our class focuses on one of 11 official languages in South Africa.
this month is Zulu.
Zulu. Well, thank God I'm not taking that class.
spanish was hard enough.
well, what do you have now?
heh, that's Zulu.
come on, follow me.
okay.
that's her. The girl next door.
for some reason, Oliver seems to like her.
well, we'll see how long that lasts.
Ah, this is gonna be fun.
our first assignment for today will be to have each of you write a poem in Zulu.
now this poem needs to describe your favorite place in South Africa and why.
Katie, Jesse, since you are new,
I don't expect you to read the entire poem in Zulu, but just give it your best shot.
now who here would like to partner up with Ms. Clarke?
so, how's it going, partner?
we've got dry rot, bad pipes, the roof needs replacing.
I need to order some corrugated iron... partner.
iron? I was thinking more about tile.
too pricey. Just because you've stayed in a hotel, doesn't mean you know how to run one.
we're gonna make this a great lodge.
I want to out-Mara Mara.
Ah, I see.
the American way, bigger and better. Super-size it.
well, you're not in America now and you're not at your New York law firm.
this is the bush.
and if you fight it, it's gonna eat you up.
Oh, yeah, I am so growing on him.
Hey.
Hey.
I've got a proposition.
I'm all ears... and knees. Never mind.
you know I want to be a vet.
I was hoping you could ask your father if I can apprentice with him.
sure, but why don't you ask him?
well, I thought it'd be better coming from his own flesh and blood than me.
do you speak Zulu?
you know, I don't.
and you know, I do.
I mean, I could be of invaluable help on this class project.
Mm... how very quid pro quo of you.
hello.
I'm Doctorlarke.
just, just call me Danny.
Umkulu sent me, said you had a sick cow. How are you? Nice to meet you.
do you speak English by any chance, sir?
I'm not gonna understand a thing you tell me.
it's not good.
okay. So... good, good.
let's, let's take a look.
partnering with Katie? It's the poor girl's first day. Go easy.
I just wanna get to know her.
Lauren, get over him. My brother isn't worth it, trust me.
I get to see what he looks like in the morning.
Oliver and I break up and get back together. It's what we do.
it's twisted and romantic and I'm not gonna let some new girl mess it up.
Ugh, I hate new girls.
especially, New Yorkers. They think they're cool.
Hey!
hey there, new girl. - Hi.
Hey, thanks for taking me on.
Oh, first days are the worst.
but stick with us and we'll help you navigate
Oh, come on, mate, change, you're gonna be late.
it's bad enough wearing jackets to class, but dressing up like Colonel Sanders is where I draw the line.
you're gonna get tossed out of gym.
exactly.
we love New York.
my dad spoke at the UN last summer. I took Emily along.
we partied every single night. Yeah!
it's the party capital of the world. We go out like every night.
who's we? Uh!
let me guess. You've got some hot New York boy toy.
is he older? 'Cause guys here are so lame.
Yeah. College junior at NYU.
,really? Maybe he'll come visit. We'd love to meet him.
Yeah, sure.
who is that guy?
he's hot. I told you so.
that's Jesse. My stepbrother.
Madiba is Nelson Mandela's honorary title.
your name is Chase Clarke. The new boy from New York, right?
I've adopted Madiba as a tribute to Mr. Mandela.
well, while tributes are important, in my class you will respond when your name is called.
chase, why don't you write the problem on the board.
my name is Madiba.
chase, to the board.
Madiba.
well, Madiba, you have just earned yourself a first visit to the principal.
she's got a lion!
wait, no.
what? Isicubu.
wait. Uh, hold on a second.
uh, wait.
come here. No, no, no.
no, no, not out the door.
I'm an innocent man, unjustly accused.
Yeah, me, too.
don't even try it.
chase, Mia, early bedtime.
you wanna send me to my room? I got a better idea.
send me home on the first flight.
Oh, I'll gladly contribute to that airfare.
if this is what they call family bonding, I've really missed out.
Katie, since you are the only one who the principal didn't grill us on, how was your day today?
fun! I met two cool girls, started my first day of Zulu, and I have to write a poem about my favorite spot in South Africa.
Wow. All that in a pleated skirt. I'm impressed.
I treated a water buffalo, impala, two goats and a very sick cow thank you very much. Typical day. And you, dear?
Oh, gee, uh, Art, you wanna field this one?
she wants to out-Mara Mara with her vast experience as a New York City divorce attorney.
can't wait.
Yeah, so, while Art has been murdering my spirit with his bare hands,
I've been researching South African's top lodges and it's clear that in order to compete we something to set us apart.
how 'bout we call it the Children in Captivity Lodge?
how 'bout a Nelson Mandela Lodge?
I can give tours.
how about a top-of-the-line spa lodge?
or a nudist lodge.
Zoompa. That's "naked" in Zulu.
and how do you know how to say "naked" in Zulu?
Ah! Can I borrow that?
thank you.
art, what is this thing?
it's an old windmill.
chase, get off of that before you hurt yourself.
Madiba, please.
I do believe that's the owner of the sick cow that I was talking about.
how are you?
okay, just, uh... slowly. I just have to look up, uh... Cow?
sure, that'll work.
you don't speak Zulu?
do I look like I speak Zulu?
I have an idea.
thanks for coming.
thanks for calling me.
just one second. Please. One second.
Tumelo, tell me you speak Zulu.
I do, but he's speaking Tswana which I also speak.
excellent. Tell me what he's saying, please.
uh, he, he said you told him you'd cure his cow.
he says you didn't. You made it worse.
okay. Would you just please tell him
I'd like to take his animal back to the Blue Antelope and put her on fluids. She's very, very dehydrated.
he doesn't trust you.
what's going on?
to begin, you have to be humble in your volume and, and your, your body language.
all right.
it's a traditional handshake greeting.
it lets us know you're open to our way and our land.
okay. - That was painful to watch.
not bad for the first time, thank you very much.
what?
Unjani" means "How are you?
thank you.
Unjani.
okay. Good. Okay. All right. Thank you, Tumelo.
I'd... like to be a vet one day.
dad, can, can Tumelo be your apprentice?
it seems like you need the help.
air-conditioned suites.
Butler servicstrewn on exquisite with fragrafeatherbeds.
sounds good to me. What is it?
hell.
is there really such a difference?
intermittent electricity and dead animal heads on the wall just aren't gonna cut it.
if you admire it so much, why don't you move there?
well, actually, I'd like to bring a little of it here.
you know what? I think I'm gonna do a little snooping around there and find out how they run that place.
chase, get my heartburn medicine.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Madiba-- medicine.
so how'd your first house call go?
well, I think... the cow ate some bad chicken.
I thought cows only ate grass.
or are they faking it as we drive by?
Hey.
Hey.
how's the poem going?
you find your favorite spot yet?
not even a top five.
I'm actually trying to get some study time in with your sister and Lauren.
Ah, good luck with that.
listen, there's a Dirty Skirts concert tomorrow.
it's sold out, but if you're interested...
I could, uh, snag some tickets.
it's at this really cool old amphitheater.
it could be your favorite spot.
you, uh, you like hip-hop?
Yeah, I-I love hip-hop.
if it wouldn't be too much trouble, I'd love to go. It sounds like fun.
what sounds like fun?
the, uh, Dirty Skirts concert.
Oh, yeah, you should totally come. Yeah?
Oh, I'm sorry--is it a date?
No!
Oh. Good thing,'cause Katie's got a boyfriend back in New York who could probably fly here and kick your butt.
not to mention that her first date in South Africa shouldn't be with someone like you.
she's a nice person.
someone like me? Mm-hmm.
right.
I hope that wasn't bad, what I said about your boyfriend.
no, why would it be a bad thing?
um, so when are we gonna get started on this poem?
how's after school? By our pool?
your pool? Yeah. It's where we get our best studying done.
Jesse. Hi.
uh, Katie's coming over later You should come, too.
I'll pass, but thanks.
you're new. You're supposed to want to make friends.
Oh, well, I'll keep that in mind.
me, bikini, pool.
Oh, what's the deal? Don't you like girls?
Oh, I like girls.
Oh, you're gonna tell me you've got someone back home, too.
too? - Like Katie.
is it some sort of family affliction? Can't end a relationship?
wait, Katie told you that she has a boyfriend back home?
Yeah. Why, doesn't she?
no.
get me outta here.
don't you have detention?
Yeah. And?
all right. Wait until you see this.
I like this place already.
Yeah. That's Mbali, the eighth wonder of the world.
she is beautiful.
forget it, my friend. She is way out of your league.
just enjoy that view.
help????
she lied to us.
she was probably just trying to be cool.
or she wanted us to think she wasn't single. Wasn't a threat.
God, you're so paranoid.
only in the best possible ways.
this place is so amazing.
okay, so we should get started on our poem.
let's start with our favorite place.
we have plenty of time and we have far more important things to discuss.
Yeah, like the fact your brother is so hot.
he's my stepbrother and yuck.
what do you think of Emily's brother, Oliver, if you... didn't have a boyfriend?
uh... he seems sweet.
we think he has a crush on you.
no, he does not have a crush on me.
then why did he invite you to the concert tomorrow night?
he's taking pity on me. I'm, I'm the new kid. I have no friends, all that.
you should come to the concert with us.
and we'll fill you in on all the essential gossip.
I, I already told Oliver I was gonna go with him.
you know, we should all go in the same car.
you know what? I'll set it up.
okay. Cool.
nothing says academic commitment like SPF30.
I see the poem is going well.
you know who I've just been hanging out with?
hmm? Your brother Jesse.
Oh, be careful, he's a bad influence.
well, how do you know I'm not the bad influence?
I really need to work on this poem, so I'd better go.
Hey, Katie?
are you, uh... you still on for the, um, concert tonight?
Yeah, I can't wait.
yeah? Okay, yeah.
actually, Lauren and Emily said that we should go with them, so...
Yeah, uh, it'll be easier that way.
parking's terrible.
all right, well, I'll see you tonight.
all right, cool.
Bye. - See ya.
miss New York is going to learn how we do things South Africa style.
Ugh, you didn't just say that,"South Africa style." That's so cheesy.
well, a little cheese is permitted, my heart's on the line.
you've actually got a heart?
Isifo." Disease.
I don't know this one.
bathroom.
thank you?
Ding, ding, ding.
you figure out what's going on with that cow yet, Dad?
no.
come in.
Hey, Tumelo. Welcome.
welcome to your first day of apprenticeship.
Dr. Clarke, I couldn't be more grateful for this opportunity.
so do I get to watch you do... surgery?
help with the vaccines? Whatever you want, I'm yours.
fantastic. Back wall, two ts is best.
welcome to Mara, Mrs. Clarke.
did you know that we squeeze 211 oranges each morning to make the African Mara Sunrise?
would you like one? - No, no thank you.
you sure? There's a little drool coming out of there.
Oh, all right, thank you.
Mmm. Thanks. And, of course, it's amazing.
what do you put in here and is it legal?
this is Africa. Everything tastes better.
listen, Jo, I hear you're planning on reopening the Blue Antelope.
Yes, I was thinking about it.
well, I'd hate to be the voice of doom, but, uh...
this immediate area can really only support one upscale lodge.
Really? Yes.
others have tried and failed.
you seem like quite a nice family.
I'd hate to see you throw your money away.
well, thank you for the advice.
Jesse, the school called.
did you really think that no one would notice you skipped detention?
a- About that, I found a job opening at this really cool place.
a job after school? Sounds great-- but your mom asked you about detention.
so we have detention and skipping detention.
it's just like New York, and it's gonna stop.
so there's no job, there's no hanging out
so you're grounding me?
if that's what it takes. Come to dinner.
africa keeps getting better and better.
so, I went to Mara today, and I realized that people travel all the way to Africa only to check in to the Mandalay Bay.
but if you can and rings of fire and funny names, we can't out-Mara Mara.
we need something totally different. Art, you were right.
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
sweetie, what are you doing?
I'm taking these ice cubes to Isicubu. He's panting.
little cats pant, baby. So do big ones-- it keeps 'em cool.
now, sit down, please.
maybe next year we should move to Alaska.
but then we'd have heating to contend with. Glaciers melting...
face it, we're screwed.
chase, we're not screwed.
we just, uh, have to find a way to make a difference.
and please come sit down.
we could put this windmill up.
wind energy reduces toxic and greenhouse gas, if used to replace fossil fuel-derived electricity.
how does he know all this stuff?
it's also a really cool thing to climb on.
chase, that's it. Not the "really cool thing to climb on" thing but the other part.
we'll turn the Blue Antelope green.
we are not painting it green.
no, no. An eco-lodge-- that's how we could set ourselves apart.
we'll be environmentally responsible.
and screw the air-conditioning and the fragrant flowers.
you know, turning a building green is... expsive
art doesn't have that kind of money.
you're dead right I don't.
but we have investments back home.
wait. Isn't that our college fund?
Yeah, and we're only here for a year.
what are you even gonna put a dime in it for? If we're making the Blue Antelope green, we'd be giving something back to Africa, even if we left tomorrow.
Danny, what do you think?
or It's me promising than a nudist lodge.
certainly less embarrassing. I like it.
you think I might have a say in what color we're turning my lodge?
of course. We're in this together, Art.
I see where this is going-- you're gonna put your money in now, and then a year from now, you're gonna tell us that it's one more year, and then one more year after that.
I mean, do you bother even asking what we want.
Jesse... that is not what we're saying.
ea doIt rlly esn't matter what you say, because you do what you want anyway.
Hey. Hey.
so, how's the Zulu coming?
that's very good. I'm very iress
don't be. I know three words. "Fine" happens to be one of them.
so did you find your favorite sport?
Nope. Nothing. Well, let me help.
you know, for getting me in with your father.
how's about tonight, when I'm done working with him?
I actually have plans tonight with Lauren and Emily.
we're seeing a concert-- you should come.
Lauren and Emily.
no. No, thanks.
you're spending a lot of time with them.
well, they're not aiming for the dean's list, but they've been nice to me.
just be careful.
I went to private school in New York City.
I'll be fine.
it's been like this for a few days.
he's stopped eating, and now he's having trouble maintaining his balance.
Wow.
Yeah.
well, he's definitely dehydrated.
his pupils are asymmetrical, which is often a sign of a nervous system disorder.
kind of like the cow those fluids are for but a whole lot worse.
I'm gonna draw some blood.
uh, when will I be working on some actual... animals?
in about 14 years when you graduate from veterinary school.
Danny, come quick.
one of the wildebeests just collapsed.
what's-what's wrong with him?
what the hell!
I'm over-caffeinated and a sip away from insulin shock from all the sugar we've just drank.
just go over there so she can shoot you down and we can leave.
Hi. I'm Jesse.
nice to meet you, Jesse.
I think I just might be in love.
with your friend over there?
with-with the music. Ah.
who's the band?
actually, that's me.
Really?
Mm-hmm. Wow, you're good.
you have an amazing edge to your voice.
it kind of vibrates through the body.
do-do you think that maybe you could burn me a copy so that I could download it on my nano?
so cute.
if you like our music, you can buy the CD.
you need some help?
excuse me?
the help wanted sign.
Oh, well, are you looking for a job?
that depends. You going to put in a good word for me?
Ooh, that hurt.
Hey, Lauren. - Hey. You still going?
Yeah, of course I'm going.
well, we have to drive my cousin, so can you take a taxi straight to the concert?
Oh, your cousin, too?
Yeah. Is it a problem?
no. I-I-I can get there easy.
you sure?
no. It's no problem. - I feel bad.
don't feel bad. Um, just could I get directions?
sure, and I'll tell Oliver you'll meet us there.
okay.
I saw two wildebeests drop today.
I mean, there is something going on with the animals, was far apart as Mara and the township and here, and I don't know if it's a virus, and if it is, I don't know what the common link is.
I don't know if it's insect-born.
maybe we should call a state vet.
no. You'll figure it out. You always do. Mmm.
and I will go to all my classes, and I will try my hardest to avoid detention.
that makes me so happy, Jesse.
so, can I get the job?
well, it's a good start, but let's just see how things progress.
good start. I mean, what more do you want from me?
I love that you want this job, but Danny's right.
ladies and gentlemen, the only parents in the world who actually discourage their kid from working.
Wow. Look at you.
excuse me. Excu... Um...
uh, young lady, uh, how about a jacket or some pants?
dad, I'm going to be late for the concert.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. How are you getting to the concert?
a taxi.
a taxi? - No, no, no, no, no.
you are not taking a taxi by yourself to a concert.
I'm not taking a taxi to the concert. I'm taking a taxi to Lauren's, and then we're all going to the concert together.
Lauren and Emily take them all the time. They're safe.
right, Art?
see you.
I -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Is this Chungalulla Street?
Yes, it's Chungalulla Street.
Yeah, it is. Okay.
Hi. Um, is there a hip-hop concert here tonight?
I don't know nothing.
okay. Thank you.
excuse me?
Yes. Hi.
please tell me there's a Dirty Skirts concert here tonight.
hip-hop concert? No.
it's not funny. It's really not that funny.
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm really trying to embrace this, but it's not that easy.
this would never happen to me in New York.
I have friends there, not to mention that there's a grid system.
I just got duped, and I'm looking for some-some compassion, and some consideration from somebody.
my friend is coming... with a truck.
we... We are going north. Need a lift?
that would be really nice, thank you.
Oh, of course.
why not?
for the record, this is so not my favorite place!
no offense... pigs.
thank you for offering to wash the dishes.
I really want this job, Mom.
can you please tell me what is so important about this job?
other than money and something to do other than hanging out here with you guys.
okay.
can you give us a break and stop fighting with us?
we're all in this together.
come on. I love you. You know that.
????? - What happened?
how was the concert?
I'm a big loser
you're not big loser. Hello?
truck full of little pigs, all right?
and the one guy who's actually nice to me is never gonna speak to me again.
because he thinks I blew him off last night.
who, Tumelo? No, Dad, not Tumelo.
never mind.
honey, it's hard moving to a new place, especially one filled with little pigs.
just be patient. It'll be okay.
it better be. I mean, I can deal with one terrible year, but anything more than that will be irreversible damage, got it?
got it.
we could bring in an eco-landscaper.
we could build a bonfire and burn our money.
I'm sorry. We could bury it with manure and compost it.
you know, at Mara, they spray it green.
spray what green?
the lawns.
they even rope it off so nobody can walk on it till it dries.
how good could that be for the grass and the environment?
it's exactly why we have to go green.
spray it green?
this is the bush. The grass is dry and brown.
it's part of its charm...
like me.
what are you two talking about?
at Mara, they paint the lawns green, I watched this guy do it.
he makes it look strangely perfect.
art, take me back to where the wildebeest fell.
now? - Right now. Come on.
Mara's up there? - Yeah.
what's downstream? - Township.
what exactly are you spraying on your grass?
this new brand of fertilizer we just switched to.
it's absolutely fantastic.
you know, it's actually odorless? Hmm.
it's the same type they use on the best golf courses in the world.
golf courses? Yeah.
they use herbicides, insecticides, fungicides.
now, I'm pretty sure your magic fertilizer has organophosphes, and that's what's making the animals sick.
I'd like to take a water sample and send it in for some tests.
come on. Is that really necessary?
well, I guess you have to ask yourself what's more important in your fantasy of Africa.
nice lawns or live animals?
so, how was the concert?
I didn't make it.
Lauren and Emily sent me to the middle of nowhere and I in turn, stood up Oliver.
don't say a word.
what you're witnessing right now is the height of self-control.
you know, no offense to South Africa or anything, but, um,
I'm beginning to think my favorite place is New York.
I was at the, the clinic. Your father's not there.
Yeah, he's probably at a house call or something.
come on.
this is all Soweto.
this is where the black South Africans ended up when the architects of apartheid drove them off their own property.
and this is where the end of apartheid began.
so this was a place of great poverty and injustice.
well, there still is poverty, but...
also people doing better, and people doing really well.
see, Soweto changed the whole country.
and this is my favorite spot in South Africa.
Yeah, uh, it means "I am what I am because of what we all are.
there's no single word for it in English or any other language.
it's purely African.
that's pretty cool.
you know, you shouldn't hate Africa.
cause Lauren's not Africa.
Emily's not Africa.
this, this is Africa.
ubuntu is Africa.
I am Africa.
Hey!
Hey, just wait, wait right there.
the water's no good here.
wait, wait, wait right there. Wait right there.
no, no, no. No, no.
I need to make sure you understand that that water right there is bad.
up there, uh, enza. Upstream, enza?
okay? Wait, yeah, I got, I got something here.
this water here is...
exactly right.
all right, let's get started.
you girls ready with your poem?
Katie was supposed to bring it to class. We did it as a group.
Katie's new here. She's relying on you.
I did rely on them.
it's right here.
I wrote it in Zulu, but I'm going to say it in English because I don't want to butcher the beautiful language.
our poem is called "Ubuntu.
a place at the end of the road "A place off the beaten path "Dark with nothing to see except stars "Silent except for the family and friends in my head "They make me who I am "But I also make them who they are
we all create each other out of the blackness.
this poem is based on my favorite place in Africa.
a little place I discovered when I got lost that helped me realize the meaning of Ubuntu
I am who I am because of what we all are, good and bad.
and I would have never been able to do this poem without the help of Lauren, ???? she was up to something.
but I didn't know about the wrong directions.
if I did, I would have stopped her. I'm really sorry.
you know, it's just that...
Katie, I'm sorry. Blame it on the Zulu.
what does that mean? - Look it up.
Hey, Chase, Chase, put those inside so the animals don't get them.
okay, Madiba...
let's talk.
I want you to come with me for a little walk.
you know that "Chase" was also your great-grandfather's name?
my father.
now, he came to Africa with nothing and he built up a farm with his bare hands. This farm.
now, all he ever wanted was for his family to love Africa as much as he did.
and I know that he would be happy to know that another Chase has returned home with the same love and passion for Africa that he had.
and he was a race car driver.
Really?
of course.
if you're gonna pick a Zulu name, use one that hasn't already been taken, hmm?
like your great-grandpa.
uh, I must be dreaming because I smell an H&H onion bagel being toasted right now at approximately 350 degrees.
butter... or cream cheese?
Oh, my gosh!
is that the New York Times?! - Yeah, it is.
how did
I had it shipped in.
it's a week old, but hey, it's still good.
and as of last Sunday, the Mets are still in first place.
but what happened to, uh, embracing Africa?
this move's been hard for everyone, so I was thinking maybe we don't have to embrace Africa all at once.
Yes, slowly, with cream cheese.
it looks fantastic.
very thatchy.
well, we're now invested in every possible way.
the reason I know this is 'cause I can't sleep at night.
Mmm. Just because it's your investment doesn't make it your lodge.
that catches fire because it's thatch and not corrugated iron,
I get 51% of the claim.
gosh, that is such a nice thought, but, yes, partner.
too soon for the hug.
So...how long's it gonna be?
you know, could you please not spoil this moment?
we've been through this. We're gonna be here a year, Jesse.
I really just meant how long's it gonna be until you guys decide if you'll let me get the job or not.
okay, I'm so sorry I snapped.
Jesse, what exactly is this job?
Oh, it, it's, it's the Ant Hill. It's right up off the main road.
I'll probably just be, you know, cleaning up, serving food, doing dishes, but it's something to do.
so when you were washing dishes the other night, that was job training?
something like that.
take my car.
on second thought, take Art's car.
so, you still hiring?
that depends.
are you here for a job or to flirt?
a job.
okay, well, you'll be mopping floors and clearing tables, washing dishes.
I wash a mean glass.
great. Uh, how old are you?
cause...
sale of alcohol is prohibited to???????
eighteen. I'm 18.
I'm sorry if I stood you up.
I really wanted to go.
Emily told me what happened.
she feels bad.
my sister can be mean now and then, but she's, uh, she's no Lauren.
God, what did I do to that girl?
it's, it's more what I did.
we used to date.
Oh!
I wish I knew that a week ago. But I, um...
I, uh, I guess it doesn't matter now.
I'm actually kind of to blame, too.
out of a moment of new girl desperation,
I told them I have a boyfriend and I don't.
great.
or, you know, whatever.
well, I'll tell Jesse that you came by.
Yeah. Thanks.
all right, well, I'll see you later, yeah?
okay.
some firsts you can see from a mile away.
but there are others that sneak up on you
like first time you at all
or the other may and being more
or the first time you relise you matter have lagle you feel
or you need find a way to standing right beside you
semi-annual Pan-African Consortium of Eco-friendly Lodge Operators Conference and Symposium.
sounds like a party.
what does it mean? Nap time.
no, it's an honor. Jo's been asked to give a speech about turning the Blue Antelope green.
I don't know about an honor.
I guess it's an honor.
how long is the drive to Durban?
about five hours. We leave first thing tomorrow morning, come back Sunday afternoon.
Yes!
I mean, we're going to miss you both.
we're installing surveillance cameras everywhere.
Seriously? Mm-hmm. No, Mia, she's messing with us.
you are messing with us? Wouldn't you like to know.
and while we're gone, Art is in charge.
What?!
why do we need a baby-sitter?
in New York, you guys left us alone all the time.
not all the time.
we had a super, a doorman, and the Kleinfelds next door.
the Kleinfelds are in their 90s.
okay, they didn't hear so well, but at least they were there.
because they couldn't leave the house.
we'll just feel better leaving you with an adult. Art?
art? Mm-hmm.
while I appreciate the childcare proposition,
I'm off for a few days.
off? Off where?
my annual African bush trek.
your what?
every year, I go into the bush with nothing but a knife and my wits.
to test myself against the land and the animals.
reaffirms my manhood.
we really need you to watch the kids.
Ntatu's off this weekend.
can I come? It's just for men.
why didn't you say anything?
you didn't ask.
well, we'll cancel.
no, Jo, your speech.
I could take care of things.
take care" of what?
of you. Right.
Oh, like they're going to leave you in ??
we could work together.
they were able to take care of themselves in New York.
I mean, the Kleinfelds aren't next door, but the temptations of the bush are somewhat more limited.
well, it's just the first time leaving them alone in Africa.
well, there's has to be a first time at some point.
okay, look, Jo, you wrote a great speech, you're being honored.
we don't have any guests until next week.
one more day of school for these kids, then it's the weekend.
I say, let's give them a chance to prove us wrong.
Oh, we'll prove you wrong.
and if we're right?
if we're right, the next time we leave you alone will be in college.
can you handle that?
emergency numbers are on the fridge.
doctor, Ntatu, Mara.
no staying up late and don't forget to eat.
they're not going to forget to eat, honey. No junk food.
except for the flourless chocolate cake that
I baked so you could all have a sweet weekend.
get in the car, you're scaring me.
Jo, don't worry, we'll work together. Okay?
okay.
this is going to be fun.
you can't have chocolate cake for breakfast.
Jesse said we could. Want some?
we have extra icing. Hey! No.
why aren't you guys in uniform?
Jesse said us we could do whatever we want, eat whatever we want and dress however we want.
Mia, is this soda?
no, it's coffee.
Jesse, Chase and Mia are eating cake.
I told you to feed them breakfast and they can't do whatever they want.
Why?
because we promised Dad and Jo.
so that we could get them to leave.
no.
and don't tell me what to do.
okay you please help me get Chase and Mia ready for school?
I don't need anyone to get me ready for school.
I'm a man, not a child.
Yeah, me, too.
that's settled.
right. Will you help me feed the lion?
Jesse, you know how much I hate that.
have fun.
I can do this.
Ooh, I can do this. I can do this.
I can do this.
you're just a nice... kitty.
you're just a big, nice, scary kitty. I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this...
can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this.
of course you can do it.
she's practically part of your family.
she's a lioness.
Katie, there's a reason she's behind a cage.
and there's a reason that job is usually done by someone on the track team.
can you please do it?
I mean, it's just for a weekend.
I can still ask you for favors, right? After...
...ourconversation?
our "conversation"?
you know what I'm talking about.
we're friends.
I mean, we're still friends, right?
Yes. And, yes, it's okay to ask a favor.
and as your friend, it's my obligation to help you out.
although with your father away, this was supposed to be a weekend off.
guilt. Okay.
uh, what do I have to do? Shoki.
what does that mean? I don't speak Zulu.
Shoki's a girl.
she's my new lab partner.
just transferred from Cape Town.
beautiful, huh?
she's very, very smart, funny, and she loves animals.
Yeah, she looks nice.
what can I do to help?
I want to ask her out, but to do something fun, different.
what would you want to do?
I'm... I'm going to have to think about that.
you want to hang out on Saturday?
are you asking me out on a date?
I guess. Maybe.
where do you want to go?
we could go to dinner or the movies.
or I have a big, empty house.
your parents are away?
Mm-hmm. You and me, and a big, empty house. Now that could be fun.
that's exactly what I was thinking.
wait. I totally forgot.
some girlfriends are coming for a sleepover.
I'm sorry.
we've been planning it for awhile.
wait.
bring them along.
invite them.
on our date? Yeah.
we'll have a little get-together, so that we can get together.
since your parents are out of town,
I was thinking we could fly down to Cape Town and spend the weekend on the beach.
just you and me?
Yeah, there's this really romantic hotel, overlooks the water, amazing beach.
don't worry, you can have your own room.
think of all the parent-free fun we could have.
sounds amazing, but I have to stay here for Chase and Mia.
Oh.
so tomorrow from 3: 00 to 4: 00 is our choice.
Compost: Today's Trash, Tomorrow's Fuel,
or "Hydrogen Fuel Cells: Recipe For a Tiny Hindenburg?
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I falling asleep?
honey, I love you're giving a speech, but this conference,
I've got to tell you: it sounds a little dry.
al Gore is expected to speak.
Oh, that changes everything.
I'm going to checkon the kids. Honey, we just left.
I know, but I forgot to tell them...
that you baked ????
you told them that, twice.
they are now scraping Mia off the ceiling as we speak.
come on, sweetie. Look we are.
we're alone, together without the kids.
first time since we've been in Africa I might add.
Danny, this isn't a road trip, it's a business trip.
do you mind if we stop for coffee?
I'd like to take a break.
we have a schedule to keep, and I really want to get to the hotel so I can work on my speech and not look like an idiot.
sweetie, you're not going to look like an idiot.
your speech is going to be fantastic.
and you will be able to work on it even better after, if I read that billboard correctly, we get to eat all the jumbo prawns we can eat.
come on, quick stop, and right back on the road, I promise.
quick.
Hey, so is it BYOB?
excuse me? Your party tomorrow.
are you supplying us with the booze or what?
what party?
Hey, thank you.
for what?
giving me the perfect first date with Shoki.
I invited her to your party. I hope you don't mind.
wait, what party? There's no party. It's all over school.
we're not throwing a party. There's no way!
I mean, you cannot help, that's one thing, but this, Jesse. It's just a few friends, come on.
you have no friends.
look, we are living the least typical teenage life ever.
we live with warthog and giraffe.
we have strangers that sleep in our house and eat at our dinner table.
having a few friends over while our parents are gone is not just something we should do, it's something we have to do; we're morally obligated.
nice speech, nice try. No way.
and it's not just "a few friends.
people I don't even know are coming up to me asking what they should bring.
I know, the same thing's been happening to me.
I guess the word spread.
you think?
why are you even having this party? Hi, Katie.
I am so excited about tomorrow.
can't wait.
morally obligated"?
you are telling everyone the party is off or I am.
Hey, the party's on.
if you don't like it, make other plans.
well, I'm not sure what African manhood ritual your grandfather has undertaken.
generally, it occurs with boys around your age.
perfect. Can you tell me one I can do?
I'm ready to become a man.
well, I'm Xhosa, and among the Xhosa people there is a defining moment where a boy is considered different from a girl.
this sounds like exactly what I'm looking for.
this precise moment from boyhood into manhood happens upon the day of the circumcision.
what's circumcision?
thank you very much.
you know what would be great after this meal?
hmm.
a nice, crisp chardonnay.
well, we still have 500 miles to drive.
or kilometers, whatever that turns out...
we have a long way to go. I know.
but we could spend the night here.
get up first thing in the morning.
make it in time for your speech.
Oh, we already have a room booked in Durban.
so? Cancel.
??????
a big bath. A big bed.
I don't know, Danny. That seems a little irresponsible.
come on, babe. Lighten up.
lighten what?
well, you know, just... chill.
chill?
because I am trying to act semi-responsibly,
I am not chill?
all I'm saying
I think we need this.
a romantic evening away from the kids, away from guests.
tell me that does not sound fantastic.
a romantic...
okay, it sounds fantastic.
thank you. ????
two... Uh, two chardonnays, please.
Ah.
excuse me? Hi.
the party's off. The party's off.
Hey. Excuse me.
why didn't you tell me you're having a party?
I'm not. Excuse me. The party's off.
it was just a small get-together, and now the party's off.
everyone is talking about it.
everyone? Everyone's a lot of people to find and stop.
why would you want to stop it?
a party takes care of everything.
it does?
Yeah, you get to be near Chase and Mia, and we get to be alone. ???????
good morning.
and great night.
the time! What? Look at the time!
well, maybe it's in metric, babe.
Hurry!
I'm supposed to give my speech in 45 minutes!
okay.
I got to call and see if they can reschedule.
get dressed! Yeah.
I've counted backwards from Dad and Jo's expected arrival, and I've calculated the exact amount of it's going to take for cleanup.
and people say you don't know how to party.
I thought you didn't even want to.
well, short of barricading the house, it's a little out of my hands.
this party's taken on a life of its own.
Hi. You want to help me with my homework?
Absolutely.
she loves homework.
what are you doing?
men stuff.
I've researched some African traditions and found one I'm comfortable with.
can I help? You're a girl.
I can't risk any injury to you.
I'm going to camp solo in the African bush, embarking on an important rite of passage.
by this time tomorrow, I'm going to be a man.
rite of passage?
well, I've made some revisions, but the point is, it's only for men.
now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to find my Swiss Army knife.
in the bush, there are no second chances.
thank you. I, um... I understand.
they can't move my speech.
what? Why not?
because there is a whole schedule, Danny, and some people actually stick to a schedule.
Jo, I know I messed this up, but there will be more Semi-Annual
pan-african Consortium of Eco-Friendly Lodge Operators symposiums, as frightening as that sounds.
I worked really hard on the speech.
just call the kids and tell them we're coming home.
maybe it's a sign.
what is?
well, that we overslept.
you know, that we found th place.
since when do you believe in signs?
okay, I know the responsible thing would be to call the kids and go home, but, look, they know how to get a hold of us, we're not due back until tomorrow, so I say, let's do something irresponsible.
within our responsible parental parameters.
you do think I'm uptight.
your whole tone of voice. No tone.
do you actually think you're more chill than I am?
I think that before the lodge and our new responsibilities that maybe you went with the flow...
a little more?
went with the flow?
watch this.
wait. Sweetie??????
Oh, no. It's on.
uh... No, I didn't mean...
homework looks like it was grueling.
Jesse's a very dedicated student.
that's the first time those words have ever been uttered.
your parents are out of town, so we're going to take full advantage.
Oh.
that wasn't a judgmental oh.
what you do is your business.
how about you?
have you ever...?
no.
I just... I have this idea that when I am finally ready,
I'm going to be in love.
call me crazy.
no. No, you're not crazy.
for me, it's always been, you go on a date, and you like them, then...
Yeah, but...
how do those relationships usually end up?
Yeah.
it's just...
it's...
it's so important, and it's a really big deal.
Yeah. I, uh. Emily, where'd you go?
got to go back to homework.
what?
I just thought you might want to know that Chase took his German navy knife.
well, why would he do that?
to fight off lions in the bush.
but he took a few English muffins, too.
chase is in the bush?
Hello?
Jo. Hi. Uh, no.
everything is great.
um, Jesse is doing homework, and Mia is in the bath, and Chase is...
eating English muffins.
I can get Mia if you'd like.
okay. All right, well, then tell Dad I say hello.
okay, bye.
she says everything's fine.
it all sounded a little too fine.
honey, it's Katie.
she's like Maria from Sound of Music.
right now, she's probably got them all singing
chase is missing!
come on out, Chase.
we know you're in the.
chase, you can't spend the night out here.
it's not a choice. I have to pass into manhood.
I need to become a man.
manhood's going to have to wait.
I'm sorry. It's too dangerous.
if you don't let me stay out here,
I'll tell about kids swinging from lampposts.
Yeah. You know what? It's chandeliers, and if you're going to bust us, you got to get it right.
I can't believe you're blackmailing me.
I'm your sister.
desperate times call for desperate measures.
I have to complete my journey.
Yeah, well, no deal.
Hey, what's the worst that can happen?
fine.
but you are not to venture one inch further from this spot, okay?
agreed.
and here. Take my cell phone and use it if you need it.
see you guys later... if I make it.
can you believe him?
so, what's in it for me?
excuse me?
Mia plays hardball.
chase gets to become a man, you guys get a party.
what do I get? Um...
you know, I was thinking that cute pink sweater of yours would look quite nice on me.
it's too big for you.
not forever.
from you, I'll take the usual.
what's the usual?
cash.
they have a great boutique.
I'll say.
um, I'll have an iced tea, please.
no, a Mojito, but a very, very small one.
I'm fine.
Oh, hi! Hi, this is
Shoki. Hi.
uh, and this is my cousin, Bheka.
hello. Hi.
party!
I hope you don't mind. He's staying with us for the week.
he's sort of over worn his welcome at my parents' house.
Oh, I wonder why.
come in, come in. Okay.
this is the largest? Oh.
you want the fishbowl, ma'am?
Yes. The fishbowl.
okay, thanks, ma'am.
preferably with no fish.
Oh, boy. There we go. Thank you.
here's a fishbowl, ma'am.
thank you. Please enjoy.
I hope I do.
maybe we should check on the kids, huh?
they have our number.
I'm surehey'll be fine.
let's find someplace more private.
not yet.
just, uh, dance with me first.
Hey.
Hey. Do you want to get out of h
it's my , uhy. It'spart I can't just leave.
I, I don't think they'll miss you.
really, I, I would love to, I'm just...kind of
okay. Um, I'll talk to you later.
where do you work?
Oh, well... well, here actually.
Oh.
it's not really work.
I'm a veterinary assistant.
would you like to see the clinic?
clinic?
okay. OK
I'm gonna go grab us a couple of drinks
okay.
you're not really serious about feeding the lion, are you?
Oh, come on. Pathetic.
I've seen much bigger back home.
it's a, a lioness.
it's one of my jobs.
look don't let Stella fool you.
she's really sweet.
it's the ostrichesyou have to worry about.
they're vicious.
one distracts you and then... bam!
just like Jurass Park.
well, I'm just kinda scared about being this close.
Oh, no, the pen is completely safe. Don't worry.
Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry, don't worry.
big meow meow.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
no more bets.
Woo!
Oh, my God!
what's Jo-Jo gonna do next?
it-it's Jo actually.
not, not Jo-Jo.
come on, Katie.
hour four.
hunger sets in.
and thirst.
very thirsty.
parched.
the bush is unforgiving.
this experience will either make or break me...
go away.
wait. Stop.
what?
if-if you're worried about people coming in,
I already locked the door.
no, it's not that. I just...
well, where this is heading tonight...
it's such a big deal.
and I...
do you mind if we just wait and see what happens for a bit?
I mean I know what you were expecting.
I wasn't... I wasn't expecting that we...
you weren't?
well, I wouldn't have said 'no.'
but I mean whatever you want to do is fine.
really.
Hey.
what happened?
it's just a crazy party in there.
well, uh, you're here now.
so, um, what do you wanna do?
do you wanna hang out down here or, uh, go upstairs and, uh...
get away from all this craziness.
upstairs.
I really like you.
and I don't know what you're thinking is gonna go on upstairs, whatever that means, I'm...
I'm just so not ready.
I came down here because I knew we were probably on a different page.
so, I just wanted to make sure that...
you and I, um, just that, we just come to a sort of understanding about where we...
who the hell is Stella?
Oh, Stella.
guys, there's a lion!
it's coming this way... go
somebody help!
go away! Go!
Oh, it's gonna break...
get off!
she's coming this way.
how'd the lion get out?
lion! Lion...
I think I can hazard a guess.
she's leaving.
it looks like she's got the scent of some animal.
hour four and 20 minutes, and all is well.
the bottle of water helped with my thirst.
feeling more like a man already.
Yes.
very funny, Mia.
that was pretty convincing, Mia.
wait, wait.
you'll get hurt. I'll go.
then you'll get hurt.
I know more about animals than you.
all right, you know what?
I'm sure the lioness is gonna taste your expertise as she's swallowing you whole.
we'll go together.
one of us needs to be bait.
bait?
Yeah, we need someone to grab Chase.
count me in. Geez.
all right, let's go.
what do you mean by bait?
OK ??????
one of us runs with the rope attached to a piece of meat.
the lioness will follow it back to her cage.
we pull the meat through, she enters, shut the gate-- we're done.
all right, I'll run with the rope.
I'll close the gate on the cage.
ll get Chase.
do not leave the tent, Chase.
I'm not going anywhere.
come on!
come on!
Oliver, now! Now!
I'm so not ready to be a man.
no, you're not.
good work.
come on.
come on, party's over!
let's go! Sorry, guys.
drive home safe. Cheers.
I'll see you at school Thank you Appreciate it.
drive home safe.
Bye.
who is that guy? It doesn't matter as long as you're okay.
are you okay? Yeah.
this is going to cost you.
it's tough luck.
maybe we should just walk away, babe.
we are back to even now.
Why? I don't have a care in the world.
all right. I'm sorry.
you are the most chill person in the world.
I don't believe it. I know. I'm apologizing.
Oh, no, no.
I don't believe it.
Yes!
is that Art?
Oh, yes, it is.
well done
Oh, you beauty!
Hello, Art.
what are you doing here?
winning... big.
Really?
I thought you were on some big manhood trekin the bush.
I don't need to prove my manhood.
I live in the bush. I take care of wild animals.
I even eat your cooking.
Ah, well, thank you, Art.
somehow, I just didn't see you as a casino type.
Yeah, well, me anda couple of friends, we do this every year.
you know-- steaks, gambling, scotch?
it's a bit like a bachelor party, without the hookers and the vomit.
so what happened to the convention?
or were you just looking for an excuse to get away?
of course there was a convention.
so why aren't you there?
we were on our way.
long story. Yeah.
maybe you should go home to the kids.
who knows, they could be conjugating verbs incorrectly and you can't have that.
you know what? I miss them.
Yeah. They're probably playing backgammon and watching movies.
look at this mess.
I don't want to do this right now; I'm so exhausted.
Yeah, me too.
let's just get up early and do it before they get back.
I mean, we got all day tomorrow.
yeah
Hello?
Shh... Shh! Shh!
Hi, Jo. What's going on?
no, we're, we're good. We're fine.
how are you?
Oh... great.
I can't wait to see you.
tell Dad I say "hi." Okay, bye.
they're on their way back. They're going to be here in 2 hours.
I've never felt so alive!
?????
this is impossible.
we can't do this.
two hours is not enough time.
two weeks isn't enough time.
we want to help.
good. 'Cause we are going to need all the help we can get.
you remember my Valentine's Day party last year?
no. Exactly.
you girls start with the floor.
Oliver, help me with the furniture.
come on.
my new sweater! Oops.
it's so not fair.
I'm really worried. Have you seen Bheka?
um, I think he got shuttled home by Oliver, actually.
look, I know this might be a funny time to say this, but... this is fun.
Yeah, cleaning up is always the highlight of every party.
well, it is the most unusual first date I've ever had, but... thank you.
you're welcome.
um...
look, I'm really sorry, but we really got to go.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
thanks for inviting us, though.
Oh, well, thank you so much for helping cleaning up.
it was very nice meeting you. You too.
see you at school? Okay Bye. bye
Hey. Done with designated driving?
I'm in between shifts.
look, we need to talk.
I feel like I offended you.
no, I'm...
look, I'm a guy, and I know I can be eager, but just so you know, I'm totally cool with us taking our time.
you are, really?
Yeah. I really like you.
and you know...
we'll be together when the time's right.
that makes me so happy.
and, I mean, just so I know,
I mean, are we talking like months or years?
Oliver... What? I'm just asking.
you know, it will be worth the wait when it happens.
Yeah, I keep telling myself that.
you know, as much as I didn't expect,
I did kind of hope.
and I can't believe I'm going to say this, but...
I'm kind of glad you did what you did.
or didn't do.
I understand.
good, 'cause... I'm happy, too.
rre you ready?
uh, Yeah. I'll, um... see you later.
cool. Oh, hey...
here. Aw, thanks.
bye see you cool hi ???????
no... ?????
we're back.
hey ???????
yeah ?????
OK ????????
and... I could've been a little less uptight.
a little.
with Chase and Mia, too.
a little.
shall we?
now or never.
it was my fault. It was my idea.
but I could've stopped him Enough.
Yeah, you two are acting kind of creepy.
but you are acknowledging your mistakes, so we may cut you some slack.
Really? Slack?
that's a concept completely unfamiliar to me.
wait. How much slack are we talking?
Oh, you will be punished... just not for life.
Jo and I will discuss it.
alone.
if your friend Tumelo hadn't invited his cousin, we wouldn't even have to worry about slack.
Oh, yeah. It's my fault.
you're the one who came up with the idea.
so... how much slack we talking?
well, the kids are okay, as is the lodge, give or take a few windows.
so, I'm thinking middle age, we can take them out of house arrest.
that sounds fair to me.
Yeah.
Wow. When they're middle age, we'll be...
much more chill than we already are.
is that possible?
Danny, you were right.
I think between the kids and the move and the lodge,
I've been... a little uptight.
so I think we need to go away more often, just us.
I think I need to be Jo-Jo at least once a year.
Really?
personally, I love that idea.
I don't know if the rest of the world can handle it.
who are you? We are three wise men.
what? We are three wise men.
well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at 2: 00 in the morning?
that doesn't sound very wise to me.
we are astrologers. We have come from the east.
is this some kind of joke?
we wish to praise the infant.
we must pay homage to him.
homage? You're drunk! It's disgusting!
out the door! Out! Bashing me with tales about oriental fortunetellers.
come on, out! No, no. We must see him.
go and praise someone else's brat. We were led by a star.
led by a bottle, more like. Go on out.
we must see him. We have brought presents.
out! Gold, frankincense, myrrh.
well, why didn't you say? He's over there.
sorry the place is a bit of a mess.
well, what is myrrh anyway? It is a valuable balm.
a balm? What are you giving him a balm for? It might bite him.
what? That's a dangerous animal.
no, it isn't. Yes, it is.
it's great big and no, it is an ointment.
well, there is an animal called a balm... or did I dream it?
so you're astrologers, are you? Well, what is he, then?
hmm? What star sign is he?
well, Capricorn. Capricorn, eh? What are they like?
he is the Son of God, our Messiah.
king of the Jews!
that's Capricorn, is it? No, that's just him.
Oh, I was gonna say, otherwise there would be a lot of them.
by what name are you calling him? Uh, Brian.
we worship you, O Brian, who are lord over us all.
praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.
you do a lot of this, then? What?
this praising. No, no, no, no.
well, if you're dropping by again, do pop in.
and thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense.
but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time, all right?
thank you. Goodbye.
well, weren't they nice?
out of their bloody minds, but still... look at that!
here! Here!
that that's mine! Hey, he's a baby! Oh!
shut up!
Brian
the babe they called Brian
he grew
grew, grew and grew
grew up to be
grew up to be
a boy called Brian
a boy called Brian
he had arms and legs
and hands and feet
this boy
whose name was Brian
and he grew
grew, grew and grew
grew up to be
Yes, he grew up to be
a teenager called Brian
a teenager called Brian
and his face became spotty
Yes, his face became spotty
and his voice dropped down low
and things started to grow
on young Brian and show
he was certainly no
no girl named Brian
not a girl named Brian
and he started to shave
and have one off the wrist
and want to see girls
and go out and get pissed
a man called Brian
this man called Brian
the man they called Brian
this man called
bri
Aah!
how blessed are those who know that he's a god.
how blessed are the sorrowful. They shall find consolation.
how blessed are those of gentle spirit.
they shall have the earth for their possession.
how blessed are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail.
they shall be satisfied.
how blessed are those whose hearts are pure.
they shall see God.
speak up! Shhh. Quiet, Mum.
well, I can't hear a thing. Let's go to the stoning.
Shhh! We can go to a stoning anytime.
Oh, come on, Brian. Will you be quiet?
don't pick your nose.
I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching.
you was picking it while you was talking to that lady.
I wasn't. Leave it alone. Give it a rest.
do you mind? I can't hear a word he's saying.
don't you "do you mind" me! I was talking to my husband.
well, go and talk to him somewhere else. I can't hear a bloody thing.
don't you swear at my wife.
I was only asking her to shut up so we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.
don't you call my husband "Big Nose." Well, he has got a big nose.
could you be quiet, please? What was that?
I was too busy talking to Big Nose.
I think it was, "Blessed are the cheese makers."
what's so special about the cheese makers?
well, obviously, it's not meant to be taken literally.
it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
see, if you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard that, Big Nose.
Hey! Say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in.
better keep listening. Might be a bit about, "Blessed are the Big Noses."
Oh, lay off him.
Oh, you're not so bad yourself, Conch Face.
where are you two from, Nose City?
one more time, mate, I'll take you to fuckin' cleaners!
language! And don't pick your nose.
I wasn't gonna pick my nose. I was gonna thump him!
hear that? "Blessed are the Greek." The Greek?
well, apparently he's going to inherit the earth.
did anyone catch his name? You're not gonna thump anybody.
I'll thump him if he calls me "Big Nose" again.
Oh, shut up, Big Nose. Oh! Right. I warned you.
I really will slug you so hard oh, it's the meek!
"Blessed are the meek!" Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
I'm glad they're getting something, 'cause they have a hell of a time.
listen, I'm only telling the truth. You have got a very big nose.
Hey, your nose gonna be three foot wide across your face when I'm finished!
Shhh! Who hit yours, then? Goliath's big brother?
Oh. Right. That's your last warning.
Oh, do pipe down.
silly bitch. Get in the way on me.
Oh, come on. Let's go to the stoning.
all right.
blessed is just about anyone with a vested interest in the status quo.
well, what Jesus fails to appreciate is it's the meek who are the problem.
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.
Oh, come on, Brian. They're gonna stone him before we get there.
all right.
that's disgusting.
it's the chap with a big nose's fault. He started it all.
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.
why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, Mum?
it's written, that's why.
beard, madame?
Oh, look, I haven't got time to go to no stonings.
he's not well again.
stone, sir?
no, they got them up there, lying around on the ground.
Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this.
feel the quality of that. That's craftsmanship, sir.
well, all right. We'll have two with points and a big, flat one.
can I have a flat one, Mum? Shhh!
sorry. Dad. All right.
two points, two flats and a packet of gravel.
packet of gravel. Should be a good one this afternoon.
who? Local boy.
Oh, good. Enjoy yourselves.
Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath?
do I say yes? Yes. Yes.
you have been found guilty by the elders of the town...
of uttering the name of our Lord.
and so as a blasphemer...
you are to be stoned to death.
look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was, "That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah."
blasphemy! He said it again!
did you hear him?
really!
are there any women here today?
very well. By virtue of the authority vested in me
Ow! Lay off! We haven't started yet!
come on! Who threw that?
who threw that stone? Come on.
she did! She did!
he did! He did!
sorry. I thought we'd started.
go to the back.
always one, isn't there? Now, where were we?
look, I don't think it ought to be blasphemy, just saying "Jehovah."
you're only making it worse for yourself.
making it worse? How could it be worse?
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!
I'm warning you, if you say "Jehovah" once more
right. Who threw that?
come on. Who threw that?
him, him, him.
was it you? Yes.
right Well, you did say "Jehovah."
stop! Will you stop that?
stop it! Now, look! No one is to stone anyone...
until I blow this whistle.
do you understand? Even and I want to make this absolutely clear
even if they do say "Jehovah."
good shot! Bravo!
have I got a big nose, Mum? Oh, stop thinking about sex.
I wasn't! You're always on about it, morning, noon and night.
will the girls like this? Will the girls like that?
is it too big? Is it too small?
here you are, mate.
bless you, sir. Alms for the poor.
alms for a leper. Alms for an exleper.
bloody donkey owners. All the same, ain't they?
never have any change. Oh, here's a touch.
spare a talent for an old exleper? Buzz off!
spare a talent for an old exleper?
a talent? That's more than he earns in a month!
half a talent, then. Now, go away!
come on, Big Nose, let's haggle. What?
you open at one shekel. I start at 2, 000. We close about 1, 800.
no. 1, 750?
go away! 1, 740?
leave him alone! All right, two shekels. Isn't this fun, eh?
look, he's not giving you any money, so piss off!
all right. Half a shekel for an old exleper? Did you say "exleper?"
sixteen years behind the bell, and proud of it, sir.
well, what happened? I were cured, sir.
cured? Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.
well, who cured you? Jesus did, sir.
I was hopping along, minding my own business.
all of a sudden, up he comes, cures me!
one minute, I'm a leper with a trade;
next minute, my livelihood's gone.
"you're cured, mate." Bloody dogooder.
well, why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
I could do that, sir. Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week.
you know, something beggable but not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.
Brian! Come and clean your room out!
there you are. Thank you, sir. Thank
half a denary? Me bloody life story.
there's no pleasing some people.
that's just what Jesus said, sir.
Oh! Good afternoon.
Oh, uh, hello, officer.
I'll be with you in a few moments, all right, dear?
what's he doing here? Don't start that, Brian. Go and clean your room out.
bloody Romans! Now look, Brian.
if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have all this.
and don't you forget it. We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.
well, that's not entirely true. What do you mean?
well, you know you were asking me about your my nose?
Yes. Well, there's a reason it's like it is, Brian.
what is it?
well, I suppose I should've told you a long time ago
what? Well, Brian...
your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
well, I never thought he was. None of your cheek!
he was a Roman, Brian.
he was a centurion in the Roman army.
you mean you were raped? Well, at first, yes.
who was it? Naughtius Maximus, his name was.
promised me the known world, he did.
I was to be taken to Rome, housed by the forum slaves, asses' milk, as much gold as I could eat.
then he, having his way with me, he had
vroom, like a rat out of an aqueduct! The bastard!
Yeah, so next time you go on about the bloody Romans, don't forget you're one of 'em!
I'm not a Roman, Mum! And I never will be!
I'm a kike, a Yid, a hebe, a hooknose!
I'm kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea pedestrian, and proud of it!
sex, sex, sex. That's all they think about, huh?
well, how are you, then, officer?
ladies and gentlemen, the next contest...
is between...
Frank Goliath, the Macedonian babycrusher, and Boris Mineburg.
Larks' tongues. Wren's livers.
chaffinch brains. Jaguars' earlobes.
wolf's nipple chips. Get 'em while they're hot. They're lovely.
dromedary pretzels, only half a denar. Tuscany fried bats.
I do feel, Reg, that any antilmperialist group like ours...
must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base.
Oh, great. Francis? Yeah, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg, provided the movement never forgets that it is the inalienable right of every man or woman.
or woman to rid himself
or herself. Or herself
agreed. Thank you, brother.
or sister. Or sister.
where was I?
I think you finished. Oh, right.
furthermore, it is the birthright of every man
or woman. Why don't you shut up about women?
women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement.
why are you always on about women, Stan?
I want to be one.
what? I want to be a woman.
from now on, I want you all to call me "Loretta."
what? It's my right as a man.
well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
I want to have babies.
you want to have babies?
it's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
but you can't have babies. Don't you oppress me.
I'm not oppressing you. You haven't got a womb.
where is the fetus gonna gestate?
you're gonna keep it in a box?
here, I've got an idea.
suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans'
but that he can have the right to have babies?
good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors.......
for your right to have babies, brother
sister. Sorry. What's the point?
what? What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies...
when he can't have babies?
it is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
symbolic of his struggle against reality.
it's dangerous out there.
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses. Ocelot spleens.
got any nuts? Haven't got any nuts. Sorry.
I've got wrens' livers, badger spleens. No, no, no.
otters' noses? I don't want that Roman rubbish!
why don't you sell proper food? Proper food?
Yeah, and not those rich, lmperialist tidbits.
well, don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this stuff.
all right. Bag of otters' noses, then.
make it two. Thanks, Reg. Two.
are you the Judean People's Front? Fuck off!
what? Judean People's Front!
we're the People's Front of Judea!
Judean People's Front! Wankers.
can I join your group? No. Piss off.
I didn't want to sell this stuff. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody! Shhh. Shhh!
are you sure? Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans.
listen, if you wanted to join the P. F.J. you'd have to really hate the Romans.
I do. Oh, yeah? How much?
a lot.
right. You're in.
listen. The only people we hate more than the Romans...
are the fuckin' Judean People's Front.
Yeah! Splitters!
and the Judean Popular People's Front. Oh, yeah! Splitters!
and the People's Front of Judea. Splitters!
what? The People's Front of Judea.
we're the People's Front of Judea!
Oh. I thought we were the Popular Front.
people's Front!
what happened to the Popular Front? He's over there.
Splitter!
Oh! I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
absolutely dreadful.
brother! Haha! What's your name?
Brian. Brian Cohen.
we may have a little job for you, Brian.
what's this, then? "Romanes eunt domus"?
"people called Romanes, they go the house"?
lt says "Romans, go home."
no, it doesn't. What's Latin for "Roman"?
come on! "Romanes"?
goes like? "Annus"?
vocative plural of "annus" is? "Anni?"
Eunt"? What is "eunt"? "Go."
conjugate the verb "to go."
so "eunt" is?
third person plural, present indicative. "They go."
but "Romans, go home" is an order, so you must use the
the imperative. Which is?
um, oh, oh, "I."
how many Romans? Aah! Plural, plural.
"Domus"? Nominative?
"go home." This is motion towards, isn't it, Brian?
dative!
no, not dative!
accusative, accusative!
"Domum," sir. "Ad domum." Except when "domus" takes the locative, sir. Which is?
understand? Yes, sir.
now, write it out 100 times.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar, sir.
hail Caesar. If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar and everything, sir.
finished!
right. Now, don't do it again.
Hey, bloody Romans!
we're gettin' in through the underground heating system here, up through into the main audience chamber here, and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.
having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate that she is in our custody...
and forthwith issue our demands.
any questions? What exactly are the demands?
we're giving Pilate two days to dismantle...
the entire apparatus of the Roman lmperialist State, and if he doesn't agree immediately, we execute her.
cut her head off? Cut all her bits off.
send them back on the hour, every hour.
and, of course, we point out that they bear...
full responsibility when we chop her up...
and that we shall not submit to blackmail.
no blackmail!
they bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had.
and not just from us. From our fathers and from our fathers' fathers.
and from our fathers' fathers' fathers. Yeah.
and from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers. Don't labor the point.
and what have they ever given us in return?
the aqueduct. What?
the aqueduct.
Oh, yeah, yeah. They did give us that.
and the sanitation.
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like.
Yeah, I'll grant you, the aqueduct and sanitation are two things the Romans have done.
and the roads. Well, obviously the roads.
I mean, the roads go without saying, don't they?
but apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct and the roads
irrigation. Medicine.
education. Yeah, all right. Fair enough.
and the wine.
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss, Reg, if the Romans left.
public baths. And it's safe to walk in the streets at night.
Yeah, they certainly keep order. They're the only ones who could in a place like this.
all right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
brought peace. Oh, peace! Shut up!
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
my legs are old and bent.
it's all right, Matthias.
it's all clear.
well, where's Reg?
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.
what went wrong? The first blow has been struck.
did he finish the slogan? A hundred times, in letters ten foot high, all the way around the palace.
Oh, great. Great.
we We need doers in our movement, Brian, but before you join us, know this:
there is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death...
to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
Oh, yeah, there's one.
but otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?
Yes.
from now on you shall be called "Brian" that is called Brian.
tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.
right. This is the plan.
now, this is the palace on Caesar's Square.
our commando unit will approach from Fish Street under cover of night...
and make our way to the northwestern main drain.
if questioned, we are sewage workers on our way to a conference.
Reg, our glorious leader and founder of the P. F.J. will be coordinating consultant at the drain head, though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action...
as he has a bad back.
aren't you going to come with us? Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.
once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence.
there is a Roman feast later in the evening, so you must move fast.
and don't wear your best sandals.
turning left here, we enter the CaesarAugustus memorial sewer, and from there proceed directly to the hypocaust.
this has just been retiled. So, terrorists, careful with those weapons.
we will now be directly beneath Pilate's audience chamber itself.
this is the moment for Habbakuk to get out his prong.
Shhh. Shhh.
campaign for Free Galilee.
Oh, uh, People's Front of Judea. Officials.
Oh. What's your group doing here?
we're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife, take her back, issue demands.
so are we. That's our plan. What?
we were here first. What do you mean?
we thought of it first. We did!
Yes, a couple of years ago. We did!
come on. You got all your demands worked out, then?
of course we have. What are they?
well, I'm not telling you. Oh, come on!
that's not the point. We thought of it before you.
did not! We did!
you bastards, we've been planning this for months.
well, tough pity for you, Fish Face. Oh!
brothers, we should be struggling together.
we mustn't fight each other.
surely, we should be united against the common enemy.
the Judean People's Front!
no, no, the Romans!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's right.
right. Where were we? You were gonna punch me.
brothers!
what
you lucky bastard.
who's that?
you lucky, lucky bastard.
what? Quite the little jailer's pet, are we?
what do you mean? You must've slipped him a few shekels.
slipped him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face.
Oh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face!
I sometimes hang awake at night dreaming of being spat at in the face.
well, it's not exactly friendly. They have me in manacles.
manacles?
my idea of heaven is to be allowed to be put in manacles...
just for a few hours.
they must think the sun shines out of your ass, son.
Oh, lay off me! I've had a hard time!
you've had a hard time? I've been here five years.
they only hung me the right way up yesterday, so don't you
all right, all right.
they must think you're Lord God Almighty.
what will they do to me? Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.
crucifixion? Yeah, first offense.
get away with crucifixion? It's
best thing the Romans ever did for us. What?
Oh, yeah, if we didn't have crucifixion, this country'd be in a bloody mess.
guard! Nail him up, I say!
guard! Nail some sense into him!
what do you want?
I want you to move me to another cell.
Aah! Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism.
shut up, you! Sorry.
now take my case. They hung me up here five years ago.
every night, they take me down for 20 minutes, then they hang me up again, which I regard as very fair in view of what I've done.
and if nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans, and it's taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life...
unless you're prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's
Oh, shut up!
here. Pilate wants to see you.
me? Come on!
Pilate? What's he want to see me for?
I think he wants to know which way up you want to be crucified.
nice one, centurion. Like it.
shut up! Right, right.
terrific race, the Romans. Terrific!
hail Caesar. Hail.
only one survivor, sir. Oh. "Throw" him to the floor.
what's that? Throw him to the floor.
Oh.
now, what is your name, Jew?
Brian, sir. "Bwian," eh?
no, no. Brian.
Aah!
the little rascal has "spiwit."
has what, sir? "Spiwit."
Yes, he did, sir.
no, no. "Spiwit," "bwavado," a touch of "dewwingdo."
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.
so, you dare to "waid" us?
to what, sir?
"Stwike" him, centurion, very "woughly."
Aah! And "thwow" him to the floor, sir?
what? "Thwow" him to the floor again, sir?
Oh, yes, "thwow" him to the floor, please.
Aah! Now, Jewish "wapscallion"
I'm not Jewish. I'm a Roman.
a "Woman"? No, no. Roman.
Aah!
so, your father was a "woman." Who was he?
he was a centurion in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Really? What was his name?
Naughtius Maximus.
centurion, do you have anyone of that name in the garrison?
well, no, sir.
well, you sound very sure. Have you checked?
well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.
like, uh, "Sillius Soddus" or "Biggus Dickus," sir.
what's funny about "Biggus Dickus"?
well, it's a joke name, sir.
I have a very great friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.
Silence! What is all this insolence?
you will find yourself in gladiator school "vewy" quickly...
with "wotten" behavior like that.
can I go now, sir? Aaah!
wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.
"Wight!" Take him away!
Oh, sir, he I want him fighting wild, "wabid" animals within a week.
Yes, sir. Come on, you.
I will not have my friends "widiculed" by the common "soldiewy."
anyone else feel like a little giggle...
when I mention my "fwiend,"
Biggus...
Dickus?
what about you? Do you find it "wisible..."
when I say the name...
Biggus... Dickus?
he has a wife, you know?
you know what she's called?
she's called "Incontinentia."
Incontinentia buttocks.
shut up! What is all this?
I've had enough of this "wowdy," "webel" behavior!
Silence! Quiet! "Pwaetowian" guards!
seize him! Seize him! Blow your noses and seize him!
hmm? Hmm.
Oh, you lucky bastard.
and the Bezan shall be huge and black...
and the eyes thereof red with the blood of living creatures!
and the whore of Babylon...
shall ride forth on a threeheaded serpent!
and throughout the lands there'll be a great rubbing of parts.
the demon shall bear a ninebladed sword.
ninebladed not two or five or seven, but nine which he will wield on all wretched sinners, just like you, sir, there.
and the whoring shall be on the head of Addius.
there shall in that time be rumors of things going astray, um, and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are.
and nobody will really know where lieth...
those little things...
with the sort of raffia work base that has an attachment.
at this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer, and the young shall not know where lieth...
the things possessed by their fathers...
that their fathers put there only just the night before about 8: 00.
yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...
in that time
how much, quick? It's for the wife.
Oh, uh, 20 shekels. Right.
what? There you are.
wait a minute. What?
we're supposed to haggle. No, no, no. I've got to get
what do you mean, no? I haven't got time.
well, give it back, then. No, no. I just paid you.
Burt, this bloke won't haggle. Won't haggle?
all right. Do we have to?
I want 20 for that. I just gave you 20.
are you telling me that's not worth 20 shekels? No.
feel the quality. That's none of your goat. I'll give you 19, then.
no, no, no. Do it properly. What?
haggle properly. This isn't worth 19. You just said it was worth 20.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Come on, haggle.
all right, I'll give you ten. That's more like it.
ten? Are you trying to insult me?
me with a poor, dying grandmother? Ten?
all right, I'll give you 11. Now you're gettin' it.
did I hear you right? Eleven? This cost me 12. You want to ruin me?
Seventeen? No, no, no, no. Seventeen.
eighteen. No, no. You go to 14 now.
all right, I'll give you 14. Fourteen? Are you joking?
that's what you told me to say! Oh, dear.
Oh, tell me what to say, please!
offer me 14. I'll give you 14.
he's offering me 14 for this! Fifteen!
seventeen. My last word. I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
sixteen. Done.
nice to do business with you.
I'll throw you in this as well. I don't want it, but thanks.
Burt. All right, all right.
now, where's the 16 you owe me? I just gave you 20.
right. That's four I owe you, then. That's right. That's fine.
I've got it here somewhere. That's four for the gourd.
four? For this gourd?
look at it! It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel.
you gave it to me for nothing. Yes, but it's worth ten.
all right, all right.
no, no, no, no. It's not worth ten.
you're supposed to argue. "Ten for that? You must be mad."
Oh, well. One born every minute.
Daniel. Daniel.
job. Job.
Joshua. Joshua.
judges. Judges.
and Brian. And Brian.
I now propose that all seven of these exbrothers...
be now entered in the minutes as probationary martyrs to the cause.
I second that, Reg. Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.
siblings, let us not be down on it.
one total catastrophe like this...
is just the beginning!
their glorious deaths shall unite us all in
look out!
Hello?
Matthias?
Reg? Go away.
Reg, it's me, Brian.
get off! Get off out of it!
Stan! Piss off.
Yeah, piss off. Bugger off.
Oh, shit!
coming.
yea, verily at that time it is written in the book of Obadiah, a man shall strike his donkey and his nephew's donkey.
my eyes are dim. I cannot see.
are you Matthias? Yes.
we have reason to believe you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth, a member of the terrorist organization, the People's Front of Judea.
me? No. I'm just a poor old man.
I have no time for lawbreakers.
my legs are grey. My ears are nulled.
my eyes are old and bent.
quiet! Silly person.
guards, search the house.
you know the penalty laid down by Roman law...
for harboring a known criminal?
no. Crucifixion.
Oh.
nasty, eh? Could be worse.
what do you mean, "Could be worse?"
well, you could be stabbed.
stabbed? Takes a second. Crucifixion lasts hours.
it's a slow, horrible death.
well, at least it gets you out in the open air.
you're weird.
no, sir. Couldn't find anything, sir.
well, don't worry. You've not seen the last of us, weirdo.
big Nose. Watch it!
whew, that was lucky.
I'm sorry, Reg.
Oh, it's all right. He's sorry.
he's sorry he led the Fifth Legion straight to our headquarters.
well, that's all right, then, Brian. Sit down.
have a scone. Make yourself at home. You klutz!
you stupid, birdbrained, flatheaded
my legs are old and bent.
my ears are grizzled. Yes?
there's one place we didn't look. Guards!
I'm just a poor old man.
my nose is knackered.
have you ever seen anyone crucified?
Crucifixion's a doddle.
don't keep saying that.
found this spoon, sir.
well done, sergeant.
we'll be back, oddball.
open up!
you haven't given us time to hide.
in that time the serpent, he shall strike you
holes from every bitch you got germs from jumbo jets
don't pass judgement on other people...
or you might get judged yourself.
what? I said, don't pass judgement on other people...
or else you might get judged too.
who, me? Yes.
thank you very much. Not just you. All of you.
that's a nice gourd. What?
how much do you want for the gourd? You can have it.
have it? Yes. Consider the lilies.
don't you want to haggle? No. In the field.
what's wrong with it? Nothing. Take it.
consider the lilies? Well, the birds, then.
what birds? Any birds.
Why? Well, have they got jobs?
who? The birds.
have the birds got jobs?
what's the matter with him? Says the birds are scrounging.
the point is, the birds, they do all right, don't they?
well, good luck to 'em. Yeah, they're very pretty.
okay. And you're much more important than they are, right?
so what are you worrying about? There you are. See?
I'm worrying about what you've got against birds.
I haven't got anything against the birds.
consider the lilies. He's having a go at the flowers now!
give the flowers a chance. I'll give you one for it.
it's yours. Two, then.
look, there was this man, and he had two servants.
what were they called? What were their names?
I don't know. And he gave them some talents.
you don't know? Well, it doesn't matter.
he doesn't know what they were called!
they were called Simon and Adrian. You said you didn't know!
it really doesn't matter. The point is, there were these two servants.
he's making it up as he goes along. No, I'm not!
and he gave them wait, were there three?
Oh, he's terrible.
there were two or three. Oh, get off!
now hear this! Blessed are they...
three. Who convert their neighbor's asses.
for they shall inhibit their girth. Rubbish!
and to them only shall be given to them only shall be given what? Hmm?
shall be given what? Oh, nothing.
what were you going to say? Nothing.
Yes, you were going to say something. No, I finished.
tell us before you go. I'm finished.
no, you don't. Why won't he tell?
won't say! It ain't a secret, is it?
must be, otherwise he'd tell us. Tell us.
leave me alone. What is the secret?
is it the secret of eternal life? He won't say.
if I knew the secret of eternal life, I wouldn't say.
leave me alone! Just tell me, please.
we were here first.
go away! Tell us, master.
is that his gourd? Yeah, but it's under offer.
this is his gourd.
ten! It is his gourd!
we will carry it for you, master.
master? He's gone!
he's been taken up.
he's been taken up!
nineteen! No, there he is. Over there.
look! Oh! Oh!
he has given us a sign.
he has given us his shoe!
the shoe is the sign. Let us follow his example.
what? Let us, like him, hold up one shoe!
for this is his sign that all who follow him shall do likewise!
Yes! No, no. The shoe is a sign...
that we must gather shoes together in abundance.
cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
no, let us gather shoes together! Let me!
no, it is a sign that, like him, we must think not of the things of the body...
but of the face and head.
give me your shoe! Get off!
follow the gourd, the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem!
the gourd! Hold up the sandal, as he has commanded us.
it is a shoe! It's a sandal!
no, it isn't! Cast it away!
put it on! Clear off!
take the shoes and follow him!
come back! Stop!
let us let us pray.
yea, he comes to us...
like the seeds of the grain.
master! Master!
Hey! Is there another way down?
is there another path down to the river?
please, please help me. I've got to get
Oh, my foot! Oh
Shhh. Oh, damn, damn, damn!
I'm sorry. Oh, damn, damn it! Blast it!
I'm sorry. Shhh. Don't you "shhh" me.
eighteen years of total silence, and you "shhh" me!
what? I've kept my vow for 18 years...
not a single, recognizable, articulate sound has passed my lips.
could you be quiet for another five minutes?
it doesn't matter now. I might as well enjoy myself.
for the last 18 years, I've wanted to shout...
and sing and scream my name out!
Shhh. Shhh. Oh, I'm alive!
hava nagila, hava nagila
hava nagila
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive! Hello, birds. Hello, trees.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
hava nagila. Hava n'ra, n'ra
master! Master! Master!
master! The master! He is here!
his shoe led us to him!
speak! Speak to us, master. Speak to us!
go away!
a blessing! A blessing!
how shall we go away, master?
Oh, just go away and leave me alone!
give us a sign!
he has given us a sign! He has brought us to this place!
I didn't bring you here. You just followed me.
Oh, it's still a good sign by any standard.
master, your people have walked many miles to be with you!
they are weary and have not eaten.
it's not my fault they haven't eaten.
there is no food in this high mountain!
what about the juniper bushes over there?
a miracle! A miracle!
he has made the bush fruitful by his words!
they've brought forth juniper berries.
of course! They're juniper bushes! What do you expect!
show us another miracle.
do not tempt him, shallow ones!
is not the miracle of the juniper bushes enough?
I say, those are my juniper bushes!
they are a gift from God. They're all I've got to eat.
I say, get off those bushes. Go on. Clear off.
Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
I'm healed! The master has healed me!
I didn't touch him!
I was blind, and now I can see!

I hadn't said a word for 18 years till he came along.
a miracle! He is the Messiah!
he hurt my foot!
hurt my foot! Hurt mine!

I say you are, Lord, and I should know. I've followed a few.
hail Messiah!
I'm not the Messiah! Will you please listen?
I'm not the Messiah! Do you understand? Honestly!
only the true Messiah denies his divinity.
what? Well, what sort of chance does that give me?
all right, I am the Messiah!
he is! He is the Messiah!
now, fuck off!
how shall we fuck off, O Lord?
just leave me alone!
you told these people to eat my juniper berries!
you break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence...
and then you try to clean up on my juniper bushes!
lay off! This is the Messiah, the Chosen One!
no, he's not. An unbeliever!
an unbeliever! Persecute. Kill the heretic!
seize him! Leave him alone!
leave him alone!
leave him alone.
let him go! Please!

Brian!
Brian! Hang on, Mother!
Shhh.
Hello, Mother. Don't you "Hello, Mother" me!
what are all those people doing out there?
well, I Come on. What have you been up to?
I think they must have popped by for something.
popped by? Swarmed by, more like.
there's a multitude out there!
they started following me yesterday.
well, they can stop following you right now.
now, stop following my son!
you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
the Messiah! The Messiah! Show us the Messiah!
the who? The Messiah!
there's no messiah in here.
there's a mess, all right, but no messiah. Now, go away.
Brian! Brian!
right, my lad. What have you been up to?
nothing, Mum. Come on, out with it.
well, they think I'm the Messiah, Mum.
what have you been telling them?
nothing. I only You're only making it worse for yourself.
I can explain. Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
your son is a born leader.
those people out there are following him because they believe in him.
they believe he can give them hope, hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
who's that?
that's Judith, Mum. Judith, Mother.
hmm. Aaah!
Ohhh! Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!
Messiah! Show us the Messiah!

behold his mother! Behold his mother!
hail to thee, mother of Brian!
blessed art thou! Hosanna!
all praise to thee, now and always!
well, now don't think you can get around me like that.
he's not coming out, and that's my final word.
now, shove off! No!
did you hear what I said? Yes!
Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
Yes! Oh, all right, then.
you can see him for one minute, but not one second more!
do you understand? Yes.
promise? Well... all right.
all right, here he is, then. Come on, Brian. Come and talk.
but, Mum, Judith. Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.
I don't really want to.
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
good morning. A blessing! A blessing!
no, no. Please. Please, please listen.
I've got one or two things to say.
tell us! Tell us both of them!
look, you've got it all wrong.
you don't need to follow me.
you don't need to follow anybody.
you've got to think for yourselves.
you're all individuals.
Yes, we're all individuals!
you're all different.
Yes, we're all different!
I'm not. Shhh.
you've all got to work it out for yourselves.
Yes, we've got to work it out for ourselves!
exactly.
tell us more!
No! That's the point! Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
otherwise Ow!
that's enough. That's enough.
Ooh, that wasn't a minute!
Oh, yes it was! Oh, no it wasn't!
now, stop that! And go away!
excuse me? Yes?
are you a virgin? I beg your pardon!
well, if it's not a personal question, are you a virgin?
if it's not a personal question?
how much more personal can you get?
now, piss off!
she is. Yeah, definitely.
morning, Savior.
lay your hands on me, quick!
now, don't jostle the Chosen One, please.
don't push that baby in the Savior's face.
I say, could you just see my wife?
you'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
we've got a luncheon appointment.
the lepers are queuing.
my brotheronlaw is the exmayor of Gath!
Brian, can I introduce the gentleman who's letting us have the Mounts on Sunday?
don't push! And keep the noise down!
those possessed by devils, try and keep them under control.
incurables, you'll just have to wait for a few minutes.
um, women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will you?
Brian? Brian, you were fantastic.
you weren't so bad yourself.
no. What you said just now. It was quite extraordinary.
what? All that, was it?
we don't any leaders. You're so right.
reg has been dominating us for too long. Well, yes.
it needed saying, and you said it, Brian. You're very attractive.
it's our revolution. We can all do it together.
I think. I think We're all behind you, Brian.
the revolution is in your hands! What?
no, that's not what I meant at all!
you're fuckin' nicked, me old beauty.
right.
stop it.
well, "Bwian," you've given us a good "wun" for our money, what?
but this time, I "guawantee" you will not escape.
guard, do we have any "cwucifixions" today?
139, sir. Special celebration. Passover, sir.
right. Now we have 140. Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?
hail Caesar!
hail. The crowd outside getting restless.
permission to disperse them, please.
disperse them? I haven't addressed them yet.
I know, sir, but
my "addwess" is one of the high points of the Passover.
my "fwiend" Biggus Dickus has come all the way from "Wome."
hail Caesar. Hail "Thaesar,"
you're not
are you not thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
give it a miss?
well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.
"Weally," "centuwion," I'm "surpwised" to hear a man like you...
"Wattled" by a "wabble" of "wowdy" "webels."
uh, a bit thundery, sir. Take him away.
I'm a Roman! II can prove it! Honestly!
and "cwucify" him well. Yes.
Biggus.
il really wouldn't, sir. Out of the way, "centuwion."
let me come with you, Pontius.
I may be of "thome" "athistance" if there is a "thudden" "crithis."
right. Now item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next five years.
uh, Francis, you've been doing some work on this? Yeah. Thank you, Reg.
well, quite frankly, siblings, I think five years is optimistic...
unless we can smash the Roman Empire within the next 12 months.
twelve months, yeah? Twelve months.
and let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one, so we gotta get up off our asses and stop just talkin' about it.
hear! Hear! It's action that counts, not words.
and we need action now! Hear! Hear!
you're right. We could sit around here all day, talkin', passin' resolutions, makin' clever speeches.
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!
so let's just stop gabbin' on about it. It's completely pointless.
and it's gettin' us nowhere. Right!
I agree. This is a complete waste of time.
they've arrested Brian! What? What?
they dragged him off! They want to crucify him!
right! This calls for immediate discussion!
what? Immediate!
right. New motion?
completely new motion. Uh, that, uh, that there be immediate action
once the vote has been taken. Obviously once the vote's been taken.
you can't act on a resolution till you've voted on it. Reg, let's go now, please!
right! In the light of fresh information from Sibling Judith. Not so fast, Reg.
Reg, for God's sake! It's perfectly simple.
all you've got to do is to go out of that door now...
and try to stop the Romans nailing him up!
it's happening, Reg! Something's actually happening, Reg!
can't you understand?
Oh!
Ooh. Ooh. Yup.

it may not matter to you, Roman, but it certainly matters to us, doesn't it, darling?
Oh, rather! Under the terms of the Roman occupancy, we're entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area.
pharisees separate from Sadducees.
and Swedish separate from Welsh!

Oh, now, now. We've got a couple of days up here.
plenty of time. Lots of people get rescued.
Oh? Yeah. My brother usually rescues me, if he can keep off the tail for more than 20 minutes.
Oh? Randy little bugger.
up and down like the Assyrian Empire.
hello. Your family arrived, then?
Reg!
Hello, Sibling Brian. Thank God you've come, Reg.
well, I think I should point out first, Brian, in all fairness, we are not the rescue committee.
however, I have been asked to read the following prepared statement...
on behalf of the movement.
"we the People's Front of Judea brackets, officials, end brackets "do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings...
to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom.
what? "Your death will stand as a landmark..."
in the continuing struggle to liberate the parent land...
from the hands of the Roman imperialist aggressors, "excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine, roads, housing, "education, viniculture and any other Romans contributing...
to the welfare of Jews of both sexes and hermaphrodites.
signed, on behalf of the P. F.J. etc.
and I'd just like to add, on a personal note, my own admiration...
for what you're doing for us, Brian, and what must be, after all, for you a very difficult time.
Reg, wwhat are you going to Goodbye, Brian, and thanks.
well done, Brian. Keep it up, lad.
terrific work, Brian.
right. And "For he's a jolly good fellow"

take him away and release him.
no, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian. No, I'm not Brian.
I was only, It was a joke. I'm only pulling your leg.
it's a joke! I'm not him! I'm just having you on! Put me back!
bloody Romans. Can't take a joke.
the Judean People's Front!
the Judean People's Front!
forward all!
come on! The Judean People's Front!
the Judean People's Front!

you silly sods.
Brian! Brian! Brian!
Judith! Terrific! Great!
reg has explained it all to me. I think it's great, what you're doing.
thank you, Brian.
I'll, I'll never forget you.
so there you are!
I might have known it would end up like this.
to think of all the love and affection I've wasted on you.
well, if that's how you treat your poor old mother...
in the autumn years of her life, all I can say is, go ahead, be crucified!
see if I care. I might have known
mum!
mum! I don't know what the world's coming to.
cheer up, Brian. You know what they say.
some things in life are bad.
they can really make you mad.
other things just make you swear and curse.
when you're chewing on life's gristle
don't grumble Give a whistle
and this'll help things turn out for the best
and
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life
if life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
when you're feeling in the dumps
don't be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the bright side of life
for life is quite absurd
and death's the final word
you must always face the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin
give the audience a grin
enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
so always look on the bright side of death
just before you draw your terminal breath
life's a piece of shit when you look at it
life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
you'll see it's all a show People laughing as you go
just remember that the last laugh is on you
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
come on, Brian. Cheer up.
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
worse things happen at sea, you know?
always look on the bright side of life
what have you got to lose? You come from nothing.
you go back to nothing. What have you lost?
nothing! "Always look on the right side of life"
nothing will come from nothing. You know what they say?
always look on" Cheer up," you old bugger.
the bright side of life" Give us a grin." There you are.
see? It's the end of the film. Incidentally, this record's available in the foyer.
always look on the right side of life
who do you think pays for all this rubbish?
always look on the bright side of life
I told him. I said to him, "Bernie, there'll never make their money back."
always look on the right side of life
Colin Raimes? Open the door, please! Police!
Mr. Raimes, we have a warrant to search the house and remove property in compliance with the Criminal Evidence Act.
smack his face in!
this is gonna look very bad on your arrest report, Colin.
interview commenced at 11. 19 a. m.
the suspect will state his name.
Colin Raimes.
also present are the suspect's lawyer, psychiatrist and social worker.
look at these photos, Colin.
Lauren Chester.
murdered in November last year.
kidnapped, no sexual assault, starved and held for 30 hours.
strangled with bootlace.
you're upsetting him. - Bettina Mitchell.
attacked last Saturday.
you said: "Fight me and you will end up like Lauren."
this is the ID picture that Bettina gave us.
this is your diary.
we found it in your room.
from the diary, quote:"I killed her. She's been killed. I'm a killer, an ace killer."
that particular entry is not awash with ambiguity.
dated November 4th.
the day after the murder.
Colin's a first-rate fantasist.
so let's talk about the night of the abduction, Colin.
november 2nd.
hold on. November 2nd?
that's correct.
he was at our drop-in centre.
some kids had thrown fireworks at him. He was distressed.
we brought him to the centre.
I think we're done.
Colin Raimes.
Colin Raimes isn't our man.
we'll go back to our best lead.
the fibres found underneath the fingernails of the victim.
definitely synthetic.
I think there's more to be had from Raimes.
let's lean on him.
what, and be sued for harassment of a schizophrenic?
he's a fantasist. It's in his psych evaluation...
screw his psych evaluation!
you used to believe in gut feeling. What happened?
nothing.
Sam, what is going on in there?
look, I can't think about this now. Ok?
I'm gonna stand you down from the case, Maya.
it's not productive, given our personal problems.
look, forget about us.
I have a theory about Raimes. About why he kept a diary.
I've made my mind up...
don't you wanna know what I'm thinking? My feeling is...
look around you. What use are feelings in this room?
Maya.
why are you shutting me out?
what are you doing?
I'm following my feeling, Sam.
I think there's more to Raimes.
I think he's trying to impress someone.
what if he knows the killer?
hang on. If social services find out...
where are you, Maya?
I'm tailing Raimes.
you're breaking up.
someone's there.
Raimes is heading up toward Satchmore Road. I'm gonna go and...
Maya, no. Listen, I'll send back-up.
Ah! - Maya!
preserve the scene, call in SOCO please.
whoever the killer is, he's taken her.
charge to 200 Joules.

how the hell are you gonna get dabs off skin?
you're so right. How can you?
what's the matter with me?
we did take some prints off a shoe, I think it was.
they've been sent down to Scotland Yard, so we should hear back in a fortnight or so, if there's a match.
a fortnight?
motive doesn't seem to be robbery.
there's 27p in her purse, plus a couple of green shields.
well, he might have taken the notes.
I mean, who's gonna take 27p?
well, I would.
after pub closing time, she stayed in the car park with a couple of fellas, but that's cool.
cool, is it? Why?
well, we know 'em. Loaders from canal wharf. They're alright.
now she was in the car park, and she was giving them Downhill Racer...
so you're not gonna take statements?
it's not them, boss.
wake up.
he didn't shag her. He didn't rob her.
so what's the motive?
Garrotted with a thin cord.
no other attack marks, nothing in or around the mouth.
what have you learnt from the stomach contents?
well, er...
Chris, have a look.
in the file, in the post-mortem file.
she wasn't fed for at least a day before she was killed.
and she was found in Satchmore Road.
come on!
enough! Come on!
stop it now! Enough!
stop! End! Finish! Come on!
walls wet, er...
I can smell the preserving agent, soap in the tray, er...
ham sandwich, half-eaten...
I can hear somebody whistling outside.
you need to get some rest, boss.
you just need a large Scotch and a bit of a kip.
it's him.
he's killed before.
we'll er... get a plonk to give you the once over.
no broken bones then.
do you feel like you're gonna heave up?
I feel a bit nauseous.
you'll do. You've had hangovers worse.
are you a doctor?
I'm about as qualified as Doctor Kildare.
I'm part of the Women's Department.
the what? - Don't you have plonks in Hyde?
go on, sir. Off you jolly well trot.
what now?
what's your name?
wpc Cartwright. - No, first name.
I was four in 1973, Annie.
hit me.
don't tempt me.
you've been in an accident. - Hit me.
shit! - I'm sorry, sir.
Hey, good girl. Prostate probe and no jelly.
why don't you call it a day, Tyler? Chris'll drive you to your place.
my... place? - Yeah, they gave us an address.
unless, of course, you're getting a bit of a taste for it in here, hmm?
this guy kills, then, what, he waits another thirty years?
is that why I'm here, because that's when he first struck?
does that make sense?
Yeah. Loads of sense.
Maya thought that Raimes knew the killer.
Colin Raimes! No, no, he'd still be in nappies.
I can take him home.
take him. He's yours.
this is Neil.
Sam.
can you hear me?
do you want me to take you home?
this is it.
it's not so bad, is it?
Mr. Enoch Powell has called for an increase in taxation to deal with inflation.
Mr. Powell called for an autumn budget...
I'm not mad. I'm not.
I had an accident.
and I woke up 33 years in the past.
now, that either makes me a time-traveller or a lunatic, or...
I'm lying in a hospital bed in 2006 and none of this is real.
33 years in the future?
that's where you're saying you're from?
see, Maya - that's my girlfriend
she's been kidnapped by the same killer who strangled Susie Tripper yesterday.
I think you should go to a hospital and ask them to check you for concussion.
he'll hold her for a day, and then...
don't you see? It's the same killer in both times.
paranoid delusion, brought about by the accident.
it's not concussion. It's psychological.
pretty fancy words for a WPC.
I studied psychology at university.
I'm just saying, I think it's a medical thing and you should sign off sick and see somebody.
what if you're my mind telling me this is real?
you'll have to work this one out on your own.
Thanks.
you know, for listening to what I had to say and then not calling the men in the white coats.
di Tyler, you don't seem like the rest of them, and you're clever enough to know that what you're saying can't be true.
Yes, it's beating.
I have to go. - Where?
what do you care? I'm not real.
as soon as I walk out that door, poof, I'm gone.
here I go.
ready, steady...
get some rest.
but what concerns us most is regulating his breathing.
that is why we have to keep the endotracheal tube in place.
I have to stress to you that Sam is in low responsiveness, but is not in a persistent vegetative state.
although he has suffered a severe cranial trauma.
but the Glasgow scale does put him at a deep level of coma.
you're talking about me!
I'm here, I can hear you, look at me, I'm here!
at times, however, he moves. Murmurs.
has motor response as though caught up in some sort of deep REM sleep from which he cannot wake.
well, this gives us some hope, despite the brain-stem bruising.
Hey! I'm here!
look at me, does this look like low responsiveness to you?! I'm here!
I can hear you, I can hear you! - Sam Tyler?
wait! No!
wait, don't leave me, I'm in BUPA!
please don't leave me!
no, please, I'm here!
don't leave me here!
please don't leave me!
bloody hell, I've seen road accidents more cheerful.
where are you today, here or planet of the Clangers?
didn't know if you were gonna show, boss.
where else could I go?
well, we're honoured.
right, we've pulled a bird in, Dora Keynes.
she was the last person to see the victim alive.
is she a suspect? - No, just a pain in the arse.
OK. Alright.
brief me in full.
what do I need to know? - She's a pain in the arse.
what, so you've handed her in to Lost Property?
well, we could use the canteen, but she's a right mouthy bird, this one.
hang on.
you're gonna do the interview in there?
thick walls.
you had a drink with Susie the night she died, didn't you, Dora?
I know you. From the picket line.
you put the boot into my old man.
Oh, happy days. - Sod off.
can't, love.
this is my esteemed colleague, DI Tyler.
Hi, Dora.
I want you to call me Sam. - You really a copper?
possibly.
when was the last time you saw Susie?
in my dreams.
how did she seem, that night?
did she mention meeting anyone?
she was horny.
did she get into an argument with a stranger.
you know the answer.
it's blowing in the wind.
I'm done with this game. Let's play another.
let's play hopscotch or pin the tail on the donkey, you pick, Dora.
I want a lawyer.
I wanna hump Britt Ekland, what are we gonna do?
your dad's waiting to take you home.
what the hell did you do to her?
well, you know. The usual.
then banged her up for obstruction. Kids, eh?
where I come from, you'd be looking at suspension.
really, what, for making a breakthrough?
at 11. 20, she saw Susie Tripper heading away from the pub, followed by a tall bloke with long hair.
the hair under those nails is not human, it's synthetic.
Yeah. Chris told me what happened in the mortuary.
I need a drink.
that 's the first sensible thing you've said since you got here.
haven't uniform got their own boozer?
you have to rubber-eel mine?
Ah, DCI Hunt.
mon brave.
you catching flies, brudder?
which part of my subconscious do you hail from?
I like you.
I like you.
Nelson's a good bloke.
What're your poisons? - Tan and bitter. Sam?
diet Coke.
I'm just joking. Pint of bitter.
give it up then.
alright.
the man you're looking for is either wearing thick gloves of some sort, or he's using... a bag, or something, made of coarse material, gets under the nails.
you can't know that from one stiff.
I've seen another. Look, I'm telling you...
what does it matter anyway?
none of this is real!
you're just some thug who crawled out of some dark little pit in the back of my mind.
then report me.
see you, Gene.
give my regards to the id.
alright! Right now! Let it be now! Come on!
you're new.
and you've got something big crammed up your jacksie, but don't worry, you'll learn.
I may be the sheriff, but I'm a deputy to the law. Now, I don't care...
if you want to take a swing for me if it makes you feel good, but what I do ask is that you don't hide anything from me.
so, have you got a hunch about this case?
with what I know, I could find this killer.
prove it.
look for these leads cropping up in any box in the room.
priority.
priority. Will call.
so where did you get these names from?
call it inspiration.
to predict what this killer might do next, we have to understand what he's thinking and feeling.
Annie?
you're familiar with this case, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
could you help us out here, please?
wpc Cartwright has a BA in psychology.
now the victim wasn't gagged.
why didn't he gag her, Annie?
forget the mind-reading act.
let's get down to the strip-tease.
because he needed to...
he needed to see a mouth.
the lips.
we have to see the things that we value.
now put yourselves in the mind of this man.
you're lonely.
every night, you dream of this girl and she's got big eyes, and red, ruby lips.
so you go out and you find that girl, and you bring her home.
but you don't gag her, 'cause you want to see those ruby lips.
but you just can't bring yourself to kiss 'em.
you get embarrassed.
angry.
you'd start to blame the girl.
it's her fault.
she's taunting him just by being there.
and then one day, you just snap.
strangle her, using bootlace, and then the cycle starts all over again, with a different girl.
and this time, you're positive you're gonna be brave enough to kiss her.
only you won't be.
I look at your lips all the time, Cartwright.
d' you think I should turn myself in?
I think you'd better trot along now, sweetheart, before I have to hose this lot down.
thank you.
how would he keep her quiet without gagging her?
I don't know.
alright.
maybe this nutter moved to the area recently.
maybe he's on day release from the loony bin.
maybe there's a new face in the local boozers, let's find out, let's not wait for another skirt to wind up dead.
and let's just hope we haven't been led up a blind alley.
sorry sir, I've checked and there's no Maya Roy listed in that area.
then try the number again.
I have no Maya Roy listed.
well, just try again!
there's no need... - Forget it.
large whisky, please.
drink ain't gonna fix things.
what am I saying?
I run a pub!
of course it'll fix things!
I'm lost, Nelson.
really lost.
you're not lost, pal.
you're where you are
and you have to make the best of it.
it's all you can do.
keep it to yourself, eh?
folks just seem happier with the other Nelson.
good luck.
look at this. These are my notes from the real world.
I made them last night.
films. Music. Wars.
just check out the detail.
don't tell me. Atom bombs over Moscow.
discussing psychology with your little friend?
I want Chris out of the collators den. It's a waste of flipping time.
no it isn't.
sorry, did that sound like a question?
I can find this killer. - Do you know what?
I think you're trying to show me up.
you don't scare me, Hunt.
it's an interesting point you raise. Allow me to retort.
better?
where are you going?
I can't deal with this place.
so you're just giving up?
look...
somewhere out there, Maya needs me.
my mind can only invent so much detail, you know, so I'm gonna walk till I can't think up any more faces, or streets.
I mean, this is just...
just what?
this is madness.
I've got a nephew, and he fell off a pier, and he couldn't remember the name of things.
couldn't tell you what an apple was, or a pencil.
and you know what?
he stopped believing in them.
then he got better.
and everything seemed real again.
follow the yellow brick road.
and what will you find?
mist? A big cliff?
white door?
I don't know.
I used to come here!
I bought my first Gary Numan. Cars.
I'm gonna call DCI Hunt.
what's he gonna do?
throw me down the stairs?
say I walked into a door?
he doesn't want me around, and he doesn't need me.
and I certainly don't need him.
Sam?
what are you doing?
he doesn't gag 'em.
he doesn't gag 'em 'cause he wants to kiss 'em, but if they shout out, he's gonna get caught, in't'e, so what's he gonna do?
strands of material underneath their nails and on their skin.
but it's not wool.
it's rough. Synthetic.
I know where the fibres come from.
Soundproofing!
he's trying to muffle the room to hide the cries.
Dora Keynes' coat was found on rough ground, what, an hour ago?
Yes, guv.
sleeve was torn.
she was last seen shouting at some bloke loitering in the street, about 9. 40pm.
so, stuff the collators office, we need to get out on the street because by your reckoning, we only have a day to find her.
anything happens to this motor and I come over your houses and stamp on all your toys, got it?
good kids.
Hello, love. CID.
we're looking for this woman, Dora Keynes.
approximately 5'2 " , curly brown hair, hazel eyes, fake topaz necklace.
we're looking for a short skinny bird, wears a big coat, lots of gob.
excellent work, ladies and gentlemen.
hunt, what?
I need to speak... Tyler... told me to let him know... name from his list.
Chris, move about a bit.
tell DI Tyler we've found one of his names in the collator's office.
we've found one!
it's one of the names you asked me to find. Raimes.
I only found the carbon.
it's a statement she made three months ago.
woman in her fifties. Mrs. Raimes.
beryl Raimes.
you gave the name Colin Raimes, so I thought there was a connection.
Yeah. she's his grandmother.
Oh, that's lovely. What nice boys you are.
do you want a custard cream, Mrs. Raimes?
Ooh, ta. - Mrs. Raimes.
you made a complaint to the police, about three months ago?
I saw a lady policeman. Nice girl.
no life for them, is it?
you came to complain about a neighbour.
that's why we have a statement from you on file.
the only trouble is, we don't know who it was, or what it was about because our copy got smudged.
have you got Garibaldis? - Chris, Garibaldis!
it's only three months ago, Mrs. Raimes. Think back. Please. Think hard.
I forget stuff.
Mrs. Raimes, it's very important. It could be vital that you remember exactly why you came to see us three months ago.
was it a next-door neighbour who you were worried about, or somebody in your street, somebody visiting, someone upset you. They did something bad, or selfish, or dangerous.
please, come on, think.
pink wafers.
I love pink wafers.
you know, all of those packets of wafers you get at Christmas.
Ooh, they are lovely.
expensive, mind. - They are, aren't they?
I sometimes get them in for my grandson.
I bet that takes a bite out the housekeeping, eh?
Chris, run down the canteen, see if we've got any pink wafers.
now, guv?
hang on. Sorry, is this helping?
do you want another cuppa? - Grand.
don't you go worrying yourself about this neighbour business.
it's not important at all. Sugar, love?
the lad next door. Number twenty.
Oh yeah? What about him, my love?
Oh, he's playing his record player all night.
Bash! Crash! Bam! And he's not even local.
so that's why you came to see us.
to complain about the noise from his stereo.
it did the trick, pet. He still lives there, but you can't hear a thing now.
back-up to 20 Kemmel Road, now!
the suspect is an Edward Kramer.
we may need uniformed back-up, have you got that?!
you will tread carefully.
we don't even have a warrant yet.
pipe lagging.
Kramer! Police! - Whoa, what you doing?
Dora? Dora?
Dora, it's alright, it's police, we're the police, it's okay, love, we've got you.
Kramer, come here!
get inside, Colin.
that's Raimes' house.
Maya was right, he knew the killer.
we were one house away.
Kramer'll never go to trial, you know that, don't you?
he's certifiable. - Nah.
jury'll send that creature down forever.
this is a doctor's report. We found it in the house.
it says he is "seriously disturbed."
he's going to a high-security hospital.
what, and be mollycoddled, indulged, be a good boy, he'll be out in twenty years. He'll still only be forty odd.
you know as well as I do, he'll kill again.
hang on.
Oh my God.
that's why he doesn't kill for so long.
we put him away in hospital, he gets out in 30 years, and then he kills.
and then he kidnaps Maya.
what are you on about? Forget the bloody doctor's note.
if the jury know they're trying a cold-blooded killer, it's life.
look, listen, you told me you were a deputy to the law.
the law is putting bad people away and you wanna show a court that note?
fine. You got principles.
hang on.
what, you want another pop at me?
you wanna get me suspended? If you like, you can try your hand.
and as for this note, I'm making it your call.
welcome to the team.
Thanks. Guv.
I'll get the lights, love.
are you okay, sir?
Sam.
can you hear me?
my name is Neil. I'm a hypnotherapist.
I'm speaking directly to your subconscious.
at this moment, I'm sitting beside you in your bed, in the IC ward of St James's Hospital.
if I am reaching you...
and you can hear me, then I know that you can wake up.
I can hear you.
I'm in a coma, yeah?
you can help me.
whatever you may be experiencing isn't real, Sam.
you can escape.
you only need to take that definitive step.
do as I tell you and you will be waking up with your family and friends around you.
your mobile hasn't stopped ringing.
Maya is here.
Maya. - She's safe.
if you can hear me, I know that will give you strength.
I'm coming back.
you tell her.
I'm coming back.
Sam?
come away from the edge.
it's okay. I know the answer.
I'm in a coma.
I'm gonna take the definitive step I need to wake up.
Neil's my ex.
he did psychology with me.
I told him all about you.
he read all those notes you made.
there was nothing in those notes about a mobile phone.
what?
this is just my mind, trying to keep me here.
he's just playing games with you.
look down. Carefully!
please don't jump!
sorry! I'm sorry! Bad joke!
please, no, Sam, don't do it!
what you doing?!
we all feel like jumping sometimes, Sam.
only we don't.
me and you, because we're not cowards.
this is just my mind.
maybe you're here for a reason.
to make a difference.
gimme your hand.
what's that on your hands, is that grit?
sand.
I was running up here and I fell against the fire bucket.
see, why would I imagine that?
why would I bother to put that kind of detail in it?
you wouldn't.
what should I do, Annie?
stay.
so where'd you meet her?
at the skating rink.
I, uh, ran over her thumb.
take my advice.
introduce her to your friends Gin and Tonic, and then you do what you like with her.
take some skating lessons. - Yes.
Hey, boss, Irish coffee.
heavy on the Irish, right?
of course.
what were you hoping for - upstairs, inside?
gotta be inside, downstairs, boss.
they're back in high school. - Bears made hibernation famous.
bats hibernate, too...
spiny anteaters, even some rodents... - Back off.
to spend the winter months in a sleeplike state.
her name's valerie palmer.
she's an air hostess for Pan Atlantic.
that makes two.
two what? - Two stews.
couple of months back, another girl got dead- Anna-Lisa Franco.
case is still open.
we need to get this guy before there's a third and the press get wind of it.
well, we found Valerie's purse.
cash and cards still there.
witness saw a man running north wearing a mask.
what kind of mask?
a ski mask.
she's not wearing underwear.
we should get a rape kit.
a what kit?
Oh, we found her flight case, too.
her diary was in there with her clothes and stuff.
read it.
Really?
it's her diary.
Chris, she's dead.
her diary might tell us who wanted her that way.
bears made hibernation famous, but bats hibernate, too!
and the hibernation keeps going and going and going.
Hibernation's so important for many species...
what's the matter? You fly this girl before there, spaceman?
holy cow.
how is that even possible?
what is it?
Annie, you gotta see this.
this is really quite extraordinary.
it's like she could be your twin.
my name is Sam Tyler.
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.
I don't know how or why I'm here, but whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet.
now maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home.
Annie, you okay?
Um...mm, not really.
not really at all.
listen, that - There's no explanation...
that occurs to me for this.
well, as a man who is intimately familiar with unexplained phenomenon, I wouldn't overthink it.
overthink it?
I've had a lot of practice lately trying to make sense out of things that don't make a whole lot of sense.
you say you're from the future.
and your mother - well, she's my age.
and your father?
uh, I was attacked by a man that you say was your father.
and now a stewardess turns up dead who looks exactly like me.
and you say, don't overthink it.
I know it's a lot, and I am happy to take the blame.
all right?
I'm just sorry the crazy seems to be rubbing off on you.
you don't get it.
this isn't about you.
this is about me, my life.
look at that girl's face back there.
look at me.
how can you just stand there and insist that this is some puppet show that's being performed in your head?
I'm sorry.
Valerie died of blunt force trauma to the back of the head.
there was evidence of sexual activity in the 48 hours before she died, but nothing that would indicate it was anything but consensual.
enter!
Tyler, glad you're here.
we need your expertise with this surveillance stuff you're always going on about. - Okay.
do you like anyone for the Valerie palmer murder? - Not yet.
well, Anna-Lisa Franco and Valerie Palmer lived in the same building in Chelsea.
Yeah, a lot of stews live there.
it's like the playboy mansion, as far as I'm concerned.
I'm picturing pillow fights and pillbow hats.
that does sound like a good place to start.
that's what we're thinking, but last time around, our investigation got stalled.
we need to try something different this time.
different? Different how?
different...
that.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
we don't have to do this, Annie.
going undercover as a dead girl is an insane idea, even for hunt.
it was my idea, Sam.
your idea?
Why?
we know that the killer wore a mask.
as far as he's concerned, Valerie never saw his face.
so I shouldn't pose any immediate threat.
Yeah, except that he left you for dead, and he's gonna make sure he gets it right the second time.
we'll bring him down before he does.
look, Sam, I went through Anna-Lisa's file.
it was nothing but dead ends. We have no leads in Valerie's case.
we can't just stand by and let another girl turn up dead.
no. No, no, no.
Annie, why are you doing this?
the universe is trying to tell me something?
I need answers.
and you're gonna get'em by posing as a dead flight attendant? - No, I'm gonna get them by posing as a dead stewardess.
right, same thing. Some day that word will become politically incorrect.
Why?
I'm not sure.
I guess it's demeaning? - Really?
will the same be said for "seamstress" and "princess" in this wonderful future of yours?
okay, I think we're geing off-topic here.
Sam, there is no next of kin to notify.
this girl led a very lonely existence.
it's all right here in her diary.
she was a recent transfer to New York. She was just getting to know her crewmates.
that's no reason. - I can do this, sam, and I would like it very much if I had your help.
you'll wear this pin at all times.
there's a microphone hidden right here.
so I wouldn't let anybody get too frisky - "A," 'cause they'll find the device, and "B," 'cause we'll be monitoring you, and the last thing I need to hear is the sound of your whoopie moan.
this is the Pan Atlantic air hostess manual.
a girdle must be worn at all times due to the pressurization of the cabin at flying altitude, the abdomen can become distended, causing an unflattering waistline.
okay.
I'm from Albuquerque, new Mexico.
my parents died when I was 8 years old.
I was raised by my uncle Frank.
when he passed away earlier this year, I decided to pursue my dream of seeing the world and become an airline stewardess.
okay.
can you hold this for me? - Sure.
can I just say one more time what an awful idea I think this is?
you can, and I can remind you of all the ridiculous situations you've put yourself into.
Oh, so what, you're trying to out-idiot me?
no, I'm trying to do my job, catch a killer -just like you.
Hello, Miss Palmer.
welcome home.
Hi, Wilson.
Valerie lives in a doorman building in chelsea with two other stewardesses.
she's not at all that close to her roommates Carol and Leslie.
seems like Valerie likes to do her own thing.
Hey, Chris. Take your date out in this love machine?
it's my cousin's van.
what, it's cool.
let me guess - upstairs, outside, and you got slapped.
give him some credit, Ray.
upstairs, inside?
well, I-I did what you said, Ray.
she had some cocktails, and... - And what?
well, I had to have a few cocktails. I mean, otherwise it looks suspicious. - Good.
I got my hand on her blouse...
outside, upstairs. - Good boy.
and, uh, I go in for the kiss, and...
it all came out.
what did?
you got sick on her?
all over her face...
and in her mouth.
that's not funny. - That's disgusting.
someone's at the front door.
wait. Guys, guys. Annie's live.
Hi.
Hi.
where have you been?
Oh, my god. I'm gonna throw up.
Hey, sounds like your kind of twirl, Chris.
you guys could swap vomit. - Shut up.
you cleaned the apartment?
it was kind of messy.
it's always messy, primarily because of you.
uh, it looks great.
no-nuts had to tidy up?
she almost blew her cover.
it's okay. Tidying up is the perfect way to cover that she spent the last hour turning over the apartment.
where have you been the last two days? You just disappeared.
I was mugged.
I had to go to the hospital. - Really?
you're okay?
Yeah, I was hit in the back of the head, and they held me a couple days for observation.
what did they take? - You know, not much. Just a little cash, my transistor radio.
you loved that radio.
I know.
you should've called.
you know -I know. I should've. I was just a little out of it.
I should go check on Leslie.
that new navigator challenged her to a harvey wallbanger chugging contest.
I'm glad you're okay, Valerie.
sounds like we're in.
nothing out of the ordinary here except a lot of pictures of David Cassidy.
there's a loose ceiling panel.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
there must be close to $2, 000 here.
at's a stew doing with that kind of crinkle?
I'm guessing nothing good.
it's a date book.
there's a highlighted entry for tomorrow.
flight 413, seat 2-B. 500.
get hold of a passenger manifest.
she's doing good in there.
Yeah, she is.
I'm gonna go out for some air.
confirm that with the airline.
Hey, Annie.
Hey, Annie, it's Sam.
is that you?
you're doing a great job.
Thanks.
Valerie really had a thing for David Cassidy.
I think I love you.
excuse me?
the -the partridge family's biggest hit.
Oh! Right.
so what's Hunt thinking about flight 413?
well, we're - we're contacting the airline.
we'll know more in the morning.
Sam, can I tell you something?
sure.
I've never been on a plane before.
Seriously?
to tell you the truth, I've never been out of the state of New York before.
um, well, sometimes it's nice to pretend to be someone else, you know?
somewhere else...
far, far away from home.
you know, when I was a kid, um, I had this, uh...
old washing machine box, and I used to pretend it was a spaceship.
and there was, um, this magazine I used to take with me on board.
on the cover was a picture of a boy with a smiling stewardess taking care of him.
she became my...
my protector...
my sentinel.
so are you telling me going undercover is like playing make-believe?
Yeah, maybe a little.
good night, Sam.
sweet dreams, Annie.
seat 2-b will be occupied by Lincoln Hart.
he's a regular flyer on Pan Atlantic.
Hart was on Anna-Lisa Franco's last flight, too.
he's also been collared for possession with intent to sell, but his lawyers got the evidence suppressed, charges were dropped, and this clown is still flyin' first-class.
whatever he's got planned for today's flight, I want to make sure Annis covered.
so what's our plan, boss?
Oh, it's a beaut.
Hey, Carol.
do something different with your hair?
just a new headband.
I love it madly.
I heard you were attacked.
I was.
I'm okay.
you know, I'm more concerned what you did to him.
I know what you're capable of when you're cornered.
great to have you back in my bird, pussycat.
he's so fine.
he's like a sculpture of Tom Jones made out of cream cheese.
Oh, but he's cute.
who's that?
you know him?
we've met a few times.
Oh, you have to introduce me.
he can put my tray in the upright position.
we should get started on preflight.
whiskey? - Uh, no, thanks. I'm, uh, flying in an hour.
I know. You're deadheading on my bird.
ronald Harris.
Tom...Cruise. Tom -Tom Cruise.
well, Tom, you're off duty.
you're not flying, so relax, enjoy the ride.
I'll make sure the girls take good care of U.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Hey, baby. - Hi.
pilots and their rituals.
I've never met a more superstitious bunch.
Rita, this is Tom Cruise.
Tom, Rita's my wife.
I took her away from stewing, and she's made me regret it ever since.
you're a lucky man.
that I am, Tom.
Rita at home, sexy stews at work. You can't beat it.
don't look so surprised, Tom.
you know most boys become pilots because they love the idea of flight
nothing but sky and sea and a line running across the horizon.
my Ronald here loves the idea of stews
nothing but lips and lashes and a line running all the way up the back of a stocking.
have a great flight, honeybunch.
bring me back something nice from Denver.
looks like a full flight.
excuse me, ma'am. - Oh, sure.
Thanks.
hi there.
would you like a blanket?
hey there, missy.
I got a little problem here.
what's that?
I got no nuts.
can you help me out with my no-nuts situation?
because I really hate no nuts.
of course, sir.
and I like 'em warm.
how are you holding up?
I'm okay.
I just hope I don't get airsick.
that could be embarrassing.
you'll be fine. Just hold on.
bogey, 1:00.
we're about to push from gate.
seat belt.
ladies and gentlemen, we're expecting some turbulence due to a passing storm front.
so watch yourselves in the aisle.
but we should be through it momentarily.
do you have it?
well - Do you have it?
Yes.
that's my girl.
I've been dreaming about it.
all crew members, please take your seats.
excuse me.
knock it off!
what are you doing? Knock it off! - Stop playing games with me!
what? - Seein' her alive spook you rotten, monkey face?
No! She was toying with me! - Shut up! Everybody, relax.
I'm NYPD.
what's going on?
turn this bird around. We're heading back to New York.
we know you??????
you paid off other stewardesses, too, didn't you?
it's a private arrangement which those women are very happy with.
it's not illegal.
I want my lawyer.
what about Anna-Lisa Franco?
I don't know who that is.
you attacked valerie for not giving you your stash, and that's what happened with Anna-Lisa, isn't it?
she messed up on your drug delivery, so you killed her.
drugs? What are you talking about?
we searched Mr. Hart's Apartment and found these.
I don't buy drugs.
I pay stewardesses because I want their underwear.
kept 'em in his personal safe like they were bank bonds.
they're even more valuable.
anything that resides beneath those yummy stew uniforms, I want them, and I pay top dollar.
Yeah. He even kept a log of his transactions.
he's a nookie bookie.
he breaks these things out, and then he takes herman to the circus.
he what? - You know...torture the tentacle?
choke kojak?
play tug-of-war with the cyclops? - Got it.
your last transaction with Valerie Palmer - You followed her home, didn't you?
roughed her up, grabbed her knickers?
no. Ask her yourself.
after I got my merchandise, I went to work.
she was with that mustachioed pilot who's always all over her.
probably that pilot Ronald Harris.
that'd make him the last person to see Valerie alive.
alive?
what are you talking about?
let's check out Mr. Hart's, uh, alibi.
you touch those, I'll break both your hands, which could put a damper on your...
paddling the canoe.
a martini? - I'd love that, really.
we didn't get a chance to catch up on the flight.
I wasn't sure if you'd talk to me again.
things got a little rough last time.
well, I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.
I've missed you at our parties.
maybe I'll have to start coming again.
I don't know.
last time you were no fun.
are you're saying you've had a change of heart?
well, I'll telll you one thing.
you're not like most mustached men I know...
always compensating for something.
Yeah, right.
I've been having this little fantasy.
I'm bringing you dessert In the cockpit.
you tell the navigator and the copilot to leave, and they do,
so it's just you and me and the deep blue sky.
you tell me to take off all my clothes, and I do, like a good girl.
I serve you your hot fudge sundae completely naked,
and then I spoon the whipped cream all over my warm, soft body
we're having one tomorrow night. 8: 00 sharp.
be there. Remember the rules, though.
bring a date...
but not someone too good-lookin'.
you know how jealous I get.
I think he bought it.
that was good.
no-nuts did good.
so what do we do now?
go out for ice cream.
I never thought it would end up like this.
I didn't.
I would do anything to go home,"back to Albuquerque."
no, there's no one left there that knows my name.
but New York city is a beast.
it has a roar.
you can hear it when you open a window.
it's a monster, and it sustains itself "on a steady diet" of girls like me.
you can feel that in its roar.
Sam, can I ask you something?
sure, Chris. What goes on?
well, you know that, um, twirl that I was dating?
the one you blew chunks on?
Yeah. - Yeah?
well, it took some doing, but, uh, she agreed to go out with me again.
good.
and I was, um, I was wondering if you could give me some pointers, you know, 'cause women like you, and...
good-lookin' and...
okay. Um, well, lo, forget what these apes told you.
just be yourself and relax.
your date's a human being.
she -she's not a "twirl." Mm.
she'll be nervous.
she'll want to be liked, just like you.
just be kind and show her some respect, that's all.
all right, we got the scoop ffrom one of Ronald's neighbors.
he throws these couples-only parties where people don't leave till the next day.
he recognized Anna-Lisa's photograph, said she was a frequent guest.
they're swingers.
we need to know what goes on there.
boss, it's when couples have intercourse with each other's partners.
thank you, Masters and Johnson.
I meant there's also something going on that got two girls killed.
send Norris in. - Oh, come on.
I-I don't think that's a good idea.
you're right.
it's a great idea - Inspired, even.
she's gonna need a date.
great.
a sex party, and we're sending in Pat Boone.
get dressed and get Norris.
I don't think any of this was who she really was.
you know, I think she was just this sad, lonely girl who -who loved David Cassidy and wanted to go back to albuquerque, but she-she didn't have any family there, so she let herself be adopted by these people.
with their sex parties and their terrible turtlenecks.
that's not how it works, Annie.
we have to be accountable for the direction our lives take.
says the man who claims to be from the future.
so if someone gets fresh with you, I want you to go for the trachea or the eyes or the groin.
we don't want a repeat of Lincoln Hart.
you know, I was thinking about our backstory - You know, how we met.
your name is, uh, Tom, but I call you Tommy.
and we met at this nightclub in Prague where a lot of stews and pilots go, and, uh,
they were having this amateur dance competition,
and you were really pathetic, and I took pity on you.
uh, improbable, 'cause I have excellent dance moves. No.
I saw a passenger get fresh with you, and I beat him to death with his meal tray.
okay? And tell everybody at the party that, 'cause, you know, they'll stay away.
don't you think that might blow our cover?
I don't give a crap about our cover.
you get hurt, I'll level the place!
or, you know, what was the name of the nigclub in Prague?
I give this operation ten minutes before no-nuts blows her cover.
what are you talkin' about?
Hey, Chris.
it's a sex party, with sex.
talkin' the talk is one thing, but Norris is frigid like an ice cube in an Eskimo's...
holy cow.
eggnog.
okay. Ready, Val?
ready, Tommy.
Hey! I'm so glad you made it.
come on in. Come in.
hello.
Hi.
Hey, everybody, this is Valerie Palmer and Tom Cruise.
this is Mr. And Mrs. Collins...
and Mr. D Mrs. Milton.
Hi.
there you go, Tom.
Oh, don't worry about him.
that camera's going away after dinner, isn't it, hmm?
great to see you, champ. - Captain.
Val, you look like a cherry tomato at the end of a kebab stick.
dance? - Sure.
is your mike on?
uh, yes, it is, yeah.
okay. I'm gonna take a look around.
if he tries anything, go for the trachea. - Okay.
or the groin.
that's the name of a man who likes to take charge.
so what are you about?
me? Uh, I'm - I'm about, uh, risky business with the color of money and, uh, a few good men.
Oh, really? I'm sorry. Not my cup of meat.
Oh, no, I did - I didn't mean...
I got all the right moves.
Mientos if I was in there, I'd be at second base by now.
I think Annie's mike is out.
Ah, this damn technology!
what is all this crap?
this is no way to do honest police work.
Sam thinks that, uh, this stuff's gonna bring down Richard Nixon.
Oh, really?
like Nixon won't notice the ugly van parked outside the white house?
let me outta here.
so your date...
he soft on you?
no. We're just friends.
good. 'Cause you know I don't like sharing you.
well, I hope everyone is suitably lubricated.
let the games begin.
uh, Valerie, honey, we don't have to do this.
Val's never shy, are you, babe?
what do I have to be shy about?
Hello, all! Sorry I'm late.
who he hell are you?
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, these are friends of ours - Uh, George and Laura Bush.
no, no. This party's Invitation-only.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Ronald.
I meant to ask you.
George, I thought you couldn't make it.
change in plans.
my wife complains I don't take her out enough.
socialize, honey.
I like him.
what the hell are you doin' here?
Annie's mike went out.
I think Mr. Bush should be alloweto stay.
all right, Mr. Bush. Your keys.
well, this should be fun. Here we go.
I hope you're ready for a dose of thunder.
saddle up.
whoa, Nelly!
all right.
we're not gonna get our own Girls, are we?
that'd be a drag.
all right. I guess I'll...
Hey, hey, hey!
well, this works out just peachy.
I'll see you all in the morning.
trachea. Excuse me.
make yourself comfortable, Tom.
I'll be right there.
are you gonna keep your clothes on all night?
everyone else is taking theirs off.
I thought I'd be different.
this is your first time, isn't it?
is it that obvious?
it's just all so much to take in, you know?
so you really like the swingers' lifestyle, huh?
I like whatever Ronald likes.
what does Ronald like?
does he like it rough?
sometimes.
does he like to...Tie up girls? Hu them?
no more than they wanna be hurt.
why are you so interested in my husband, hmm?
Oh, I just, uh...
I want to know what I can get away with.
falling in love is against the rules.
everything else is up for grabs.
you freak!
wh-what are you doing here? - What's happening?
what? - We heard you scream.
we were role-playing.
I was getting information.
he admitted to roughing up Anna-Lisa.
excuse me. Could you gentlemen leave?
I'm being punished.
Oh, excuse me.
here, let me help you.
well, from the toys we found In the other room, he's into bondage, and not just gettin' whipped.
he likes to hurt his women.
good work. Now blow.
I'm gonna ask bad boy here some questions, and it's gonna get rough.
not bad.
who the hell was that woman you brought here?
a hooker I know.
lovely.
what's going on? Who are you?
we're the police.
we know you had lations with Anna-Lisa Franco.
what happened?
the horseplay get rough?
I spanked her now and then. There was no permanent damage.
you're a cop, Tom Cruise?
Yeah. And what about Valerie?
we know that things got rough between you two, and you killed her, and you dumped her body like it was trash.
what are you talkin' about? Valerie's fine! She's right outside!
Annie? Annie, where are you?
we heard Annie calling for help. We came as soon as we could.
let me go!
where are you taking me?
come on, come on, Annie! Give us something!
they got a good head start, and I don't know how far the signal will travel.
let me go. - H, shh!
please let me go.
my folks live right here on west - west...
west... West what? Damn it?
we're gonna get out of range if I don't get a location soon. - I know!
bears made hibernation famous, but bats hibernate, too!
spiny anteaters...
the dump site!
Poor-wills, a small bird of the western united states - They have a note of two syllables only.
they also hibernate!
you home-wrecking little slut!
I don't understand.
you threw the party.
I thought
please. Ronald wanted you there.
just because I want to make my husband happy doesn't mean i'm gonna let some little tart like you take him away from me.
sex is one thing.
but falling in love...
that's against the rules.
I saw the way he looked at Anna-Lisa...
then you.
I don't want your husband.
he used to look at me like that.
I thought I got rid of you once before.
well... I won't make that mistake again.
Hey, buddy, you see anyone come through here? - No.
anyone at all? - No.
uh, a white female, Brunette - Annie!
you all right?
she confessed to killing Valerie.
what's wrong with her?
got her in the trachea.
go, nuts!
can't believe she did it.
lovely Rita...A killer.
she was jealous.
women. I'll never figure them out.
they're not so complicated.
you just shouldn't toy with their affections.
you're not of the times, champ.
I see something I want, I go for it.
I saw the way you were lookg at valerie or whatever her name is.
what have you done about it?
it's not like that between us.
baloney. I may not know women, slick, but I know men.
I know what a man who digs a woman looks like.
and you, slick, you're a man who digs a woman.
Valerie wasn't a bad person.
she just got caught up in all the wrong things along the way, and before she realized it, it was too late.
and what about these unexplained things happening to you?
did you get any closer to figuring them out?
I did.
I wondered why the universe put me in Valerie's shoes.
I think it's because of how alike we are and I don't just mean physically.
you know, I find that hard to believe. - Why?
Valerie had a dream when she became a stewardess, before everything went wrong.
I had a dream, too, when I joined the police force.
then after being "no-nuts with the doughnuts" for so long, I've lost sight of that.
well, I guess the question is...
what are you gonna do about it?
enter!
sir, I'm a good cop. No, no. I'm a great cop.
I've made breaks in half a dozen cases this year.
I want to be a detective.
I'm ready, and I think I deserve it.
I just want you to know that I'm here.
but here...Can't be all I have.
I just, uh, I-I wanted to say thank you.
what for?
well, I-I had a date with my girl.
how'd it go?
it was, um...Really nice.
good.
nice is good.
good night.
what's all this?
I'm just trying to make sense of what's happening to me.
the way I figure, I'm in a coma somewhere or on a very intense drug trip.
maybe I've traveled through time, or perhaps I've, uh, crash-landed on an alien planet, and as we speak, extraterrestrials are trying to harvest my intellect
I mean, such as it is.
maybe I'm the victim of a mind experiment, or maybe I've died and gone to heaven...
or hell. How about purgatory? Or maybe...
I've plain gone insane 'cause I don't know what's real anymore.
what's this supposed to mean?
that represents the unknown.
all things I haven't thought of yet.
it's the one out of all these that scares me the most.
this is for your own good.
if the lieutenant sees this, you'll wish you could go back in time.
I can't see her face
Maya, my girlfriend in 2008.
I spent all last night trying to picture her smile.
I couldn't do it no matter how hard I tried.
so maybe if I can figure all this out...
Sam, no more of this crazy talk.
I'm trying to be a friend to you, but
okay, fair enough.
what I'm doing in 1973 and how to get back
I'll figure it out on my own.
but until then, I guess I'm left with only one option.
and what's that, sam?
to spend my time here doing what it is I do best.
which is?
catching bad guys.
what's the big hurry, trent?
we just want to talk to you about an armed robbery.
you run like that, we'll begin to think you're guilty of something, huh?
Oops.
please, help me! Help!
what did you do that for?
for making me run.
it's all right. He's dressed for a dip.
I can't swim!
isn't this a predicament?
Nah, not really. Scum bums float.
please! Help! - All right.
Oh, come on. You can't be serious.
who are you working the check cashing robberies with, trent?
I don't know anything!
you could tell it to us, or you could tell it to the little fishies at the bottom of the lake.
Bye-bye.
uh, I don't think he's gonna come up, guys.
can't let him drown.
all right. Get him out, chris.
Oh, I can't swim. - ray?
Nah, I took some lessons when I was a kid. They didn't stick.
unbelievable. Chris?
Hooray!
all right, just breathe. You'll be fine. Just breathe
what's the hurry, mark spitz?
Hey, get this guy out of here.
I miss you, maya.
you okay, sam?
he looks like one of tm cartoon characters, got hit over the head with a frying pan.
don't he, loot? - Yeah, he does!
like in the funny papers.
like in the funny papers.
Yeah, like in the funny papers.
my name is sam tyler.
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.
I don't know how or why I'm here, but whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet.
now maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home.
last week, three aaa money check cashg stores were robbed.
a little over $12, 000 taken.
Oh, a tasty haul.
and best of luck to 'em, whoever they are.
three bodies were found, one at each store
Hey, looks like she was cute...
before she put on the dead chick mask.
Alonzo de souza and dennis maguire.
all shot, and that's no small thing considering they were tucked snug behind bulletproof glass with no witnesses, no sign of forced entry.
Yeah, that's, uh, that's very cool.
Hey, listen, any chance I'm gonna get sprung anytime soon?
you know, "laugh-in" is on tonight, and...
I got it bad for that goldie hawn.
we know you're involved, trent.
no one loves hitting check cashing stores like you and your monkey squad.
so who were you meetin' at the pool?
I was meetin' my aunt doris.
you know, you're just her type.
no, seriously.
I should give her your number.
you could be my uncle gene.
uncle gene?
Hey, that'd be perfect. Why don't we practice?
say it, you filthy scrote. You want me to stop? Say it.
uncle! Uncle! Uncle! uncle.
not bad.
what is someone who can't swim doing at lasker pool, trent?
well, it's never too late to start.
learning the backstroke ain't a crime, is it?
we found this on you when we pulled you in.
could this be your cut of the aaa money jobs?
or you just need a little padding in your swim trunks?
Yeah, that ain't my scrat.
if it was, wouldn't it be wet?
you were saying?
what is it, june?
assistant district attorney crocker is here.
fine. Throw this pile of pus back in the cage.
Oh, no, come on, man. That cell smells like vomit.
Oh, I can help you with that.
what was that?
that money isn't from the check cashing robberies.
Yeah, and roe vs. Wade ain't really two options when you find yourself in a river.
what does that even mean?
that's an analogy.
uh, no, I don't think it is.
it's like an analogy.
where I come from, what you did is called "tampering with physical evidence,
and it's a class "e" felony.
where you come from? Where is that, hyde?
where guns are made of gingerbread, and criminals confess for lollipops.
do you have any evidence linking trent to the robberies?
well, well, well. Aren't you the eager beaver?
now that was an analogy.
no, that was just obnoxious.
Ah, what's a guy gotta do to get an analogy in thisoint, huh?
if we have the evidence, we'd be able to charge him by now, right?
that's a lot of questions for a secretary.
there he is-- the golden retriever of the district attorney's office.
thank you, no-nuts.
Lee, this is the transfer from hyde I told you about-- sam tyler.
Sam, this is lee crocker.
not only does he know where all the bodies are buried, he knows the shovel sizes.
welcome aboard, tyler.
like two peas in a pansy pod.
detective, if ignorance was a drug, you'd be high all the time.
now that was an analogy.
I took a look at the file, gene.
the F. C.C. Has a better case against george carlin and his seven dirty words than you have against kim trent.
I agree.
we have no evidence to secure a conviction.
give us a second, lee.
detective tyler and i need a moment.
of course.
you want evidence?
Aladdin's cave.
what the hell is that?
there's 300 microdots of L. S. D.Here.
we plant 'em on kim trent and watch him grow into a big flower of justice.
that's just... great.
I detect sarcasm.
how would you do it where you come from?
we wouldn't have pulled him in without evidence.
even if you knew there were people out there in real danger?
people are always in danger.
one minute, you're going about your business. The next... bang!
you're taken out by a speeding car.
well, I'm taking a speeding car off the road.
so what do you wanna do?
we give him a desk appearance ticket, we cut him loose, but we stay on him.
we follow him, see where he takes us, get some real evidence so we can put him away for good.
that's your ang pl?
Yeah, that's my big plan.
fine. Cut him loose.
but whatever happens next is on your head.
you and ray stay on trent. Anywhere he goes, you guys go. Got it?
sure thing.
we'll relieve you in the morning. - Okay.
I don't know if ray's gonna go for that plan. - Why not?
he doesn't rlly, uh-- - he doesn't like me.
no. - No, I know.
no, the loot put him in for a promotion to second grade, and then you show up.
he--he just feels like you took his spot.
but I wouldn't take it personal.
Yeah, well, I didn't request this transfer.
it just happened.
it's like guantnamo bay in here.
Oh, I wouldn't know. I've never been to puerto rico.
kim trent, here is a D. A.T. You are free to go.
you gotta respect those who defend the constitution.
all hail the nixon administration.
Yeah, don't get too attached.
are you okay, sir?
did you just see that? - Was it a rat?
the rats are big in this house, sir, but they're harmless mostly.
I cleaned out that cell.
it smelled of vomit.
he was right. It did stink to high heaven.
well, I'm sure the, uh, the next prisoner will appreciate your efforts.
it's all love and light here at the, uh, 1-2-5.
in other music news, in honor of mother's day, elvis presley will be performing a special concert in lake tahoe at the tahoe sahara in memory of his mother, gladys presley
you must be 2b.
I'm windy. - Windy.
now that's an unusual name.
my father named me windy because he was a sailor and wind was his gold.
I'm sam. what?
your fate line-- it's bisected!
is that a good thing?
it can be.
it's like a record skipping.
you're listening to one song, the needle gets bumped, and you're grooving to a whole new tune. What's up there?
well, um, there--for starters, no naked women.
are you new to new york?
you could say that. - It's an adjustment.
I get homesick all the time for decorah, iowa.
lot of people, a lot of love back there.
I know the feeling.
I used to spend hours just floating in an inner tube, looking up at the clouds.
you and me, we stay in one place, but the clouds go everywhere.
so sometimes I'd ask them to carry a message back to decorah for me.
I imagine there's someone floating in a lake, looking up at the same cloud, sending me their love, too.
Hey, do you like to dance? Because I love to dance!
not really. - Oh, great.
well, then we'll have to dance. - Okay.
I'll see you around, 2b.
2-4-6 to central k, we are approaching trent's apartment.
where are chris and ray?
2-4-6 to central K.
proceed, 2-4-6.
we're outside kim trent's apartment.
detectives carling and skelton are not here.
please raise car 1-3-5 and advise with their location, K.
so is this how you do things in hyde?
you sit on your ass and watch known criminals pick their noses.
actually, in hyde, we sit on our noses and watch known criminals pick their asses.
all units, we have a report of a 10-22 disturbance at aaa check cashing.
let's go.
still think it's trent?
actually... yeah.
Hey, police!
take cover!
enough.
I hit him. - Good.
you okay?
uh, yeah, I think so.
B. P.'S stabilizing, 90 over 60.
pulse is normal.
all right. The bleeding's stopped.
excuse me. - All right, let's get her.
ready?
she's gonna be okay.
all right. - all right, go ahead.
were where you guys?
loot, we got a radio message to call into command.
now I figured it was you shutting down tyler's brilliant surveillance scheme.
took us three blocks south to find a pay phone.
found this radio in june's car.
she must've heard the call go out and tried to be batgirl or something.
and junie always had dreams of doing something important at the department.
I told her, "you're a twirl. Know your place." So she didn'T.
all right, I'm gonna canvass the block, get some statements.
somebody must've had eyeballs on this.
this doesn't make any sense.
Trent took a huge risk. He knew we'd be on to him.
there has to be a reason.
I want this mess cleaned up.
and I want you to clear this away.
I don't want any of her left lying on the street.
this is an active crime scene.
it still nds to be processed.
clean it up!
I want you to clean it up now!
she works at the precinct.
she is family.
and I want to be able to look her dad in the eye and say you cleaned up every drop of her precious blood.
get off me!
you can't blame me, you lunatic!
this is trent's fault!
he pulled the trigger!
you made sure there was a trigger to pull!
we had no evidence!
tell that to june!
I give up. I give up!
I'm sick of this cosmic joke that everyone seems to be in on but me!
I'm sick of it.
real.
unreal.
real.
unreal.
you know, this neighborhood has gone to the dogs.
Mm-hmm, right.
that's, uh, an unusual ashtray.
Yeah. My granddaughter sofia made it for me.
she loves to come over and see all the butts in there.
she says, "nonna uses it.
beautiful story.
should write a letter to the surgeon general.
you know, if I squint, there's a little bit of that... steve mcqueen?
look, you have an unobstructed view of aaa money from here, and judging from how much you love your grandchild and...
yr cigarettes, I'm guessing you spend a lot of time looking out that window.
sure, I saw what happened, but aside from the shooting, there was nothing different from any tuesday or thursday.
you guys showed up, escorting the man who got shot.
us guys"?
Yeah, the police.
policemen? In uniform?
policemen in uniform.
you screwed up, you guys. Real big-ti, huh, stevie?
astronauts in orbit to repair ailing skylab.
and those hippies think they know how to get high, junie.
let's see what kind of trouble dagwood's gettin' into today.
been looking for you, boss.
how's she doing?
same.
that felt good.
yeah? Then you're gonna love this.
I always liked june.
truth be told, she'd probably make a good cop.
I only know one way to police.
so do I.
I'm not squeaky-clean, and neither is this city.
I love this city.
it needs whoever it can get to look after it.
that's me.
you're gonna make this right.
well...
I found a witness who saw two uniforms escort trent into the store.
that's how they gained access.
watch what you're saying, tyler.
how can you... the keeper of aladdin's cave...
question the existence of dirty cops just because, you know, you don't like it?
I'm not turing the spotlight on my own department.
no, you're just gonna coerce testimony and set up suspects just to close the case.
Oh, you got somethin' on your mouth there. Let me--let me see.
what are you doin'?
Hey, stop that! - Get off me!
don't do--don't do that. - I'll do that.
police.
spaceman!
heard the boss gave you a ride to pummel city.
I need to talk with you, ray, about your moonlighting.
talk to me.
ain't like I'm the only one moonlighting at the 1-2-5.
your named turned up on a list of cops who work security for aaa money.
Yeah.
I make $300 and change a week as a third grade detective.
that's barely enough to afford the clams arreganata every friday night at guido'S.
so I work a little security when my money clip runs a little light.
what's the calamity?
well, trent was working with cops.
cops were moonlighting as security.
you have firsthand knledge.
you took a powder on the stakeout, right?
so I'm coming to you.
you coming to me 'cause you think I might be complicit?
it's the first I'm hearing about cops being involved.
well, hunt isn't with me on this, but, uh, I got an eyewitness that says so.
you should talk to crocker.
the A. D.A?
if hunt's stonewalling, you're gonna need a friend on the outside.
why are you doing this for me, going around hunt?
hunt was my hook to second grade.
for three years, I carried his water.
lot of good that did me when you showed up.
Crocker's a little too bucking-for-sainthood for my liking, but he's a straight shooter.
he'll know what to do. Give him a try.
and you think cops from the 1-2-5 are involved?
well, I don't know.
hunt's made it hard to get any traction, so that's why I'm talking to you.
I'll have one of my investigators look into it.
should take some of the pressure off.
I appreciate the help, not to mention your discretion.
of course.
heck of a way to introduce yourself to a new house.
you don't know the half of it.
Maya? Maya? you in here?
Boo!
I'll remember that next time you want me to work a uniform detail for you.
who says "boo" in this day and age?
you're like a cartoon character from the funny papers.
who says "funny papers" in this day and age?
like in the funny papers.
let's light some candles, run a bath.
I miss you, maya.
no internet, no dvd, no vameo ges...
Oh, but I don't want to live in a world without video games.
you're kinda killing the mood.
Hey, 2b!
I whipped up a tray of "welcome to the second floor" lasagna for you.
well, that's, uh, very nice of you.
what's nice is I'm about to introduce you to the most luxurious lasagna you've ever tasted.
not to toot my own horn-- it's my mom's recipe-- but it's guaranteed to cure what ails you.
that jerk you brought home last night stole your watch?
just have a slice of mom's lasagna.
the war in vietnam got you down?
just taste that smooth ricotta cheese.
how you doing today?
like some mom's lasagna will hit the spot.
hooray. It's a garden mix.
there's fresh tomatoes, zucchini, carrots, peas, plenty of herbs, and I add a healthy sprinkling of mary jane's magic earth.
Mary jane's magic earth?
no recipe is complete without it.
there's marijuana in here?
it's mellow, nothing like the blue de hue I had at my friend randy's pig roast.
you know I'm a cop.
then you must get the really good stuff.
um, there's something I've been meaning to ask.
what you said the other day about sending messages back to loved ones through the clouds...
yeah?
well... do the clouds ever respond?
Nope. It's just a one-way thing.
I never hear from the clouds.
but the stars-- they won't shut up.
my mom, my dad, my brother gregory, my best friend lolly
they all send their love to me through the stars.
because the stars speak for the lonely, blue hearts, and lonely, blue hearts tell the truth.
I gotta run. Enjoy the las'.
and don't forget, we still gotta dance.
as they say in new orleans...
bayou.
there he is, fellas.
there he is.
we should string him up from the rafters by his sneaky little rattail.
what's going on? - What's going on?
look at him play possum now.
rats, possums...
what did i tell you about analogies, ray?
the loot just got off the phone with crocker.
nice work, tyler.
Yeah, way to go, buddy.
unbelievable, huh?
did you really think it wouldn't get back to me?
good luck. - Yeah, tell me about it.
listen, bob, did you get my e-mail?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's right here.
real.
unreal.
real.
unreal.
Sam, june's awake. Are you okay?
they're not real.
what are you talking about?
the reason why I can't track down the cops working with trent isn't because hunt's been stonewalling.
it's because they don't exist.
Sam, you're not making any sense.
the cops from the check cashing robberies-- they're impersonators.
Impersonators?
they're not real cops.
so the sawbones ays you're gonna be right as rain in no time.
okay? - Yeah.
I'm still not clear what happened.
what happened was I took care of the guy that did this to you, shot him dead.
who?
did you know kim trent? - No.
but you cleaned his cell of vomit. Remember?
what were you doing outside aaa money, june?
what's wrong with you?
june seems emotional.
of course she's emotional. She was shot.
that's not the kind of emotional I'm talking about.
look at her.
kim's dead?
Yeah, he died on the scene from a gunshot wound to the chest.
that's why you were there with the police radio.
you weren't responding to the call, 'cause you were already there as a lookout and the getaway driver.
no. I just got the radio.
for kim.
Yes. I mean no. Kim loves me.
it took a while, but we found each other.
we hadn't seen each other since high school in yonkers, and then there he was, outside of the precinct, and he looked me up.
that's the kind of guy he was.
and you fed him information.
kim's gone, june.
it's time to start worrying about yourself.
I told kim things-- who was working where and when.
eventually I was able to pinch some uniforms and some dupe shields.
no one noticed. No one ever D. Tice nobody noticed me except kim.
and the radio message that called off chris and ray-- that was you?
Yes.
I thought you always wanted to join me on the bureau.
and be like you-- taking the same crap, day after day?
you're fooling yourself if you ever think they'll accept you as one of them.
junie, you know who was fooling themselves?
this, um...
listen to me.
I know whait feels like to be alone.
it's like someone's stolen away the one thing in the world you cared most about.
well, it happened to me, too.
the universe knocked me sideways and took away everything and everyone I ever cared about.
you and me...
we have the same lonely, blue heart, june.
Yeah. I guess I do have a lonely, blue heart.
Yeah.
kim told me things.
he was working with two guys, dax benson and freddy gerard.
okay. Do you know where we can find them?
I promised kim I wouldn't say anything.
june, june, I'm sorry, but it wasn't real.
what you think you had with trent was not real.
you're protecting the same man who put you in this hospital bed.
he's killed four innocent people. Do you understand?
it's time to tell us everything.
cause lonely, blue hearts tell the truth.
get down! Police! - Don't move!
you are surrounded by armed bastards.
dax benson! Hold it right there.
put your feet on the ground. Put your hands on your head.
you are under arrest.
just in time, boys. - Drop it.
no, no, no, no!
I'm on the j! I'm a cop! He's not!
I'm real! He's not! Get off me!
real cops don't run away.
lieutenant gene hunt, 1-2-5. - What?
kindly get off of my man.
- come on. Let's go.
come on. Move.
this is why trent's crew hit so many check cashing stores so quick.
they needed cash 'cause there was a shipment on the way.
all right, you two, let's go.
you ain't got no rights. Get in there.
heroin... - yahtzee!
and lots of it.
all right, step up.
you did good, tyler.
but next time you start having words with an A. D.A.
you make damn sure I know ahead of time.
see you tomorrow, boss.
we'll be out of here in five.
once again, you walk io the space I was headed for.
you and I are not gonna get along, are we? - Nope.
eventually, I will burn you down, and I will bag your ashes, and I will bury your ashes in the yard where my big dog craps big crap.
anyway, wow.
I asked you for help.
you made me out to be a rat.
it wasn't like that.
gene has a way of doing things.
I have a way of dealing with him.
it's nothing personal.
Sam, he's right.
it's complicated dealing with hunt.
you of all people should know that.
what's that?
Oh, um, well, lee got us tickets to see "grease.
you know, it's been playing for a year, and I've been dying to see it, so...
summer lovin'. Had me a blast.
I got a dinner to get to.
I'll see you later, annie.
you okay, sam?
Yeah. Fine.
you're a good cop, sam.
there's less heroin on the street 'cause you're in the 1-2-5.
and that is very real.
good night, annie.
good night, sam.
I miss you, too, baby.
I miss you, too, from the bottom of my lonely, blue heart.
time to dance, 2b.
Hey, Sammy.
look what I got you, pal.
I got you a new spaceship.
but I like my spaceship, daddy.
Yeah, but you can have this one, too.
I like mine.
his birthday's not till saturday.
you're not gonna have to work, are you?
rose, I wouldn't miss Sammy's birthday party for the world.
I promise.
one day you can go to the moon.
would you like that?
only in my spaceship.
only in your spaceship.
Ransom-drop stakeouts make you sleepy?
kidnappings are boring?
actually, I was hoping to wake up to discove rthe institution of a propera. M.B. E.R. Alert system.
you're off your snots, Tyler.
well, too bad the park ain't open.
we could pinch this kidnapper, hand mr. Kreshpane his baby, and go for funnel cakes and lap danceswith the bearded lady.
that broad still working?
something tells me wall street wasn't beckoning.
well, I just hope baby Andrewis safe, wherever he is.
baby Andrew's gonna bedead baby Andrew if we get made.
there's daddy Kreshpane now.
we got a bogey at 1: 00.
Where's my son?!
Where's my boy?! Where's Andrew?!
no, no, no.
you're under arrest for kidnapping.
kidnapping?
Sam, why do you look so stricken?
it's about my father.
what about him?
he walked out on meand my mother this year--1973.
he just disappeared from our lives.
we never heard from him again.
where did he go?
I don't know.
well, why did he go?
I have no idea.
well, do you know anything, Sam?
he left town in the middle of my 4th birthday party, before I even blew out the candles.
well, he should be arrested for that alone.
it's my birthday this saturday--the exact date he vanished in 1973.
wait, so tomorrow's your birthday?
Yeah.
how old are you gonna be?
I'm serious.
so am I.
Sam, you're not gonna be 4.
am too.
now you're acting like a 4-year-old.
Annie, after the car hit meand I arrived here in 1973, I saw an image
a woman, my mother, wearing a red dress, being chased through the woods.
now...
I-I-I can't explain it, but I keep seeing it.
you know, over and over again.
Sam, maybe we should have a little birthday party for you.
you know, I can make a cake.
no, I can't on Saturday because I have to go to lee's cousin's wedding.
but, well, maybe on monday.
you're missing the point.
maybe this is the reason why I'm here, to figure out what happened to my family...
and to prevent my father from leaving.
are you saying that that filthy kidnapper is your father?
that's exactly whati'm saying.
happy birthday to me.
my name is Sam Tyler.
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.
I don't know how or why I'm here, but whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet.
now maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home.
I swear to you, I had no idea this was about a kidnapping.
I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
so says every criminaI I've ever arrested.
I know nothing about a baby.
Yeah, right, and I got zero interest in jacking up brigitte bardot.
so...
you dared to dream, seek greener pastures.
and when you read about the Kreshpanes' windfall, you planned your score.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you out there.
get off your rusty-dusty and tell us where that baby is.
you okay?
Yeah.
you know, I...
I got a boy at home. His name is Sam.
yeah? I got a french bulldog at home named ollie.
he drools like your grandfather.
where are we goin' with all the noise?
it's just coincidence, that's all.
I got two Sam Tylers in my life?
and I think I want to talk to my lawyer now.
and i think they ruined a perfect ass when they put teeth in your head.
look, you--you're a father and a parent, and you love your son a lot, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I love my son very much.
so what?
well, so how does a guy like that end up at coney island in the early dawn, collecting a ransom?
how does he get there?
look, it was supposed to be a simple collection from a bookmaker.
at least, that's what I was told.
wh-what do--what do you mean?
I owe their people money, and they were threatening me and my family.
whose people?
the, uh, Pignato brothers.
who the hell are the Pignato brothers?
the Pignato brothers are an up-and-coming crew of the lower east side's criminal underworld.
they were penny-ante hoodlums until last year.
who?
Freddy Venettiwas a small-time bookie we found in a dumpsteron avenue C.
wait, he's missing eyes, ears and a nose.
and hands and tongue.
you can't see It in that photo.
word on the street--the Pignatos wanted it known if you cross them, you have violate done of their five senses.
they retaliate symbolically.
tin snips.
they used tin snips.
turned freddy into a potato head.
do we know if the Kresh paneshad any business associations with the Pignatos?
Mr. Kreshpane said there were none.
that's exactly why we need to lean harder on Vic Tyler.
this cren'severy shade of shady.
he keeps jerking us around, we'll have a dead baby on our hands.
enter.
uh, mr. And mrs. Kreshpane are here.
boss, maybe we should have Vic meet the Kreshpanes face-to-face.
what for?
well, Vic's gothis own family.
if he's got even an ounce of humanity, he'll be more forth coming in the presence of the devastated parents.
what do you say, boss?
get Vic Tyler.
okay but if this coffee klatch doesn't work, know what happens next?
what?
I break out the tin snips.
Mr. And mrs. Kreshpane, I know this is extremely difficult for you.
the kidnappers threatened to--to do horrible things to Andrew if we got the police involved.
we are working on this as fast as we can.
trust me.
these are Andrew Kreshpane's parents.
Whe's our baby, mr.Tyler? Where is he?
please, we need him to come home.
I'm--I'm sorry. I have no idea.
I can't help you.
all right. Come here, come here.
detective Tyler will do everything he can.
what if your son were kidnapped?
where your son is.
can you imagine being separated from him?
can you imagine the heartbreakit will cause you and your wife?
look, I feel lousy about this.
I really do.
but the Pignatos are accountable for that baby, not me.
but what if you take the fall?
what happens to your family?
who provides for them?
all right, look.
I expect a phone call this afternoon at 2: 00 to arrange for the money exchange, but that's all that I know.
the Pignatos don't know I got pinched.
not yet.
doing the right thing here.
Hey, look, a-anything just to put this behind me, you know?
you know, saturday's my boy's birthday.
I'm throwing a party for him in the park.
ice cream...
cake...
and a cowboy hat comes by and--and makes the funny animals out of balloons.
I'd like to be there for that.
you will be.
so what's the plan, Sam?
um, we'll wait for the call from the Pignatos, and
and once they give you the location on the money drop, we'll--we'll take it from there.
this is our house.
Yes, it is.
I keep meaning to get this fixed.
you never will.
I sell cleaning supplies for a living.
I'm on the road a lot.
money's not great, but you plug away, make yourself a life.
I tried to lighten the load by making some bets, you know?
I made some bad bets.
I couldn't pay them back.
you know, so they--they got me running these errands, these low-level underlings.
you know, I figured, no big shakes, right?
but look at me now.
I got a cop in my living room like I'm some common criminal waiting for these Frickin' psychos to call me
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
we're gonna figure this out.
my wife--she made me quit the cigarettes, you know?
so I do these puzzles.
they help me during stressful times.
but you still, once in a while, sneak one while she's at the grocery store, right?
I never said I was perfect, Sam.
you know, I got a real superstition about the things.
right? Once you get a puzzle that you can't solve, the key is...
it's always in the bottom right-hand corner.
and once you've figured that out, it just folds.
that's your superstition? That's your method?
well, that, and I pray to the great god of hendrix three times a day.
I'm not sure which one's working for me, but I get by.
rose. Hey, babe.
this is, um...
Uh--detective?
what are you doing here?
Oh, there--there's, um, been a rash of neighborhood break-inslately, mrs. Tyler.
I-I'm just doing a routine canvass.
you two know each other?
well, yeah.
I used to pound a beat in this neighborhood, so...
we met once briefly.
Oh, I see.
honey, uh, mmy's asking for you.
Hey.
you wanna meet the little guy?
no, I'm good.
okay.
it's detective skywalker, right?
Yes, but please, call me luke.
how much troubleis my husband in?
what makes you think he's in...trouble?
no, like I said, there's been some break-ins and I
I think we left niceties at the door that night at the club, detective.
please, I just want to know the truth.
all right.
I had to ask him some questions about a couple of things--following police protocol.
please, don't worry.
if Vic is guilty of anything, it's working too hard, missing time with his family.
heck, if that were a crime, he'd--he'd be on death row.
I understand your son has a big birthday coming up.
let me guess.
you bought hima big jim doll.
how could you possibly know that?
well, you know, all the kids love 'em thed days.
right?
I mean, you got the, uh, bulging bicep, karate chopand the test of strength belt, right?
what's not to love? I mean...
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to make sure that I have everything to bake Sammy's cake for tomorrow.
I--would you like something to drink?
no thanks, mom--mrs. Tyler.
Frazier brings up the ball...
passes to debusschere.
Debusschere looks for Willis Reed, but Reed's being double-teamed, so dave finds phil jackson.
jackson finds Sammy Tyler at the top of the key.
Tyler shoots!
nothing but net!
Hey, my kid's a big knicks fan.
Sammy's in danger, isn't he?
rose also?
I mean, the Pignatos are surely gonna come after them.
why wouldn't they?
and by--by blowing the whistle on them, you're making me signmy family's death warrant.
I'll do everything I can to protect them.
I promise.
Yeah.
you know, Sammy--he wants to be an astronaut, or a cop.
who doesn't, right?
you got kids?
no.
maybe someday.
Yeah, well, take it from someone who knows--there's no time like the present.
what...
What--what's--what's he like?
uh, your boy.
uh, he's busy up in the head, all that make-believe.
takes after his father.
when things are rough, you know...
I'm in--I'm in some tide water town trying to hock my wares--I can't make a sale.
I'm sleeping in the back of a car 'cause...
I'm trying to save money on a motel, and I gotta hear one more guy say,
sorry, not interested..."
um, what I do to--to make things all right...
I just--I tell myself...
I say,"I'm Sam's father.
I am, um, Sam's father.
and then everything...
every little thing...
it's okay. You know?
um, I'm sorry.
I just kind of...
no. No.
it's, um...
it's wt?
S--well, it's...
it's a game to 5, and winner's out.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, high five.
what?
high five. -Hey, how you doing?
like this.
high five. Okay.
my--my ball.
no, no, baby, I got it. I got it.
I always wanted to be a musician.
you okay?
yeah?
you sure you're not, you know, like, one of these guys who's a little bit light on his feet and...
what?
no.
yeah? -No.
because ever since I met you...
no. No, no, no, no.
you know, you've been looking at me in a way that makes me just a little bit nervous.
Yeah, no, that's--that's--that's part of my investigative, uh, technique.
It's--it's--it's--I study a man to assess, uh...
Oh, is that what that is?
Yeah, let me--let me do this for you.
you do that.
so, uh, we'll be outside the place monitoring your wire.
as soon as we hear the money exchange go down, We'll come blazin' in and we'll start bracing 'emon the where abouts of the Kreshpane baby.
okay.
it's normal to be scared, Vic.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
Yeah, well, you know, I only met the Pignatos one time.
mostly I just dealt with the middle men, you know?
what are they like?
what are they like?
well, when I was a kid growing up in bensonhurst, right?
there was this one time we caught these rats
these big suckers, long pink tails like whips, greasy hindquarters...
and we kept 'em.
we kept 'em in a junked outice box in the basement.
after about a week of starving and all, they started to chew their way out, right through the metal.
Yeah, I just happened to be there when they did, you know, as their
their faces were poking out, the little jawsall bloody from the effort.
never in my life had I seen such a maniacal rage, you know?
that is, until I met...
Tommy and angelo Pignato, and that was for a whole five seconds.
you know why they were pissed off, Sam?
Why?
cause the mets lost.
listen, if I die tonight-- -I'm not gonna let that happen.
if it happens, I want you to deliver the news to rose and Sammy, okay?
look, tomorrow...
if everything you've told us is true, you'll be blowing out the candles at Sammy's 4th birthday, okay?
Yeah.
we're off to see the wizard.
these bills real?
the bills are real.
that's not my worry.
my worry--is this guy for real?
not very much.
thanks a lot. It's all right.
all right. Are you sure? You sure?
cause I got somethin' for ya.
Oh, yeah? -Yeah, yeah.
easy doeit, old man.
okay, he's in.
Hey, so no-nuts said it's your birthday on saturday.
that's right.
you got any big plans?
I don't like birthdays, Chris.
police?
not me.
not a chance.
No!
shots fired! Shots fired!
listen to me.
who did this to you?
who shot you?
here's a quarter, Sammy.
knock yourself out.
remember, Sammy, if you can beat my high score,
I got a root beer dum dum waitin' for you.
Thanks, uncle butchie.
you see who shot you?
Chris, check the apartments upstairs.
vic? -No one leaves this building!
listen to me. Who shot you?
give me a name!
vic, you in here?
down here.
I've been shot.
careful. Careful. Please, careful.
easy.
are you okay?
Where's the briefcase?
they took it.
I don't know how they know I squealed.
which way did they go?
I didn't see.
after they fired, they ran off, and I just shut my eyes 'cause I thought that they were gonna come back and fish the job--aah!
what kind of fink are you, Tyler?
he's been shot!
letting the Pignatos get away with the money before we can nab 'em?
he needs a doctor, not an interrogation!
we have to find 'em!
find the baby.
just go. I'll be okay.
stay put.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
see anyone?
nobody came out the back, but there's a delivery door in the basement we didn't know about.
they might've went out that way.
Chris, you all right?
I know, I know, I know.
it's baby Andrew.
I heard him crying from all the way down the hall.
poor little guy probably hasn't been fed all day.
Yeah, we're going for a ride.
Oh, don't be afraid of your uncle ray.
you see what you did, ray?
wanna do more? -Yeah, sure.
you made him cry.
you made him cry over here.
so the loot says the D. A.'Sgonna drop the charges.
I'm still embarrassed I got wrapped up in any of this in the first place.
we never would've found the baby if you hadn't risked everything to help us.
you did a good thing today, a really good thing.
okay.
I'm sure your son will be very proud of what his father did today.
Hey, um, I guess now you'll be able to go help him blow out his candles.
won't you?
won't you, Vic?
Absolutely.
I wouldn't miss it.
there he is.
Hey, Annie!
you're so sweet.
where did you get your rocket?
Oh, that was, uh, with him when we found him.
maybe one day you'll get to the moon, too, Sammy, huh?
it's not Andrew's.
Oh, we should voucher that, yeah.
where is he? -Detective.
Wh--where's Vic？ He left this morning.
did he say where he was going?
who knows where he goes when he goes?
I don't.
do you? -No, I don't.
detective, do you know what Vic is wrapped up in?
no.
I'm--I'm not sure.
no.
Yeah, well, you know what? I'm not surprised.
but I will say one thing--since you showed up here yesterday, Vic has been even moreagitated than usual, and I would like to know why that is.
I want you to promise me something.
please, be careful.
there are some very bad men out there
who barge into strangers' homes whenever they damn well please.
Yeah, I think I'm looking right at one.
contrary to what you might think, detective, I don't always need saving.
I'm a big girl and I can take care of myself and my boy.
I-I know you can.
it's just...
you're wearing a red dress.
my, deteive, what keen powers of observation you have there.
a-are you--are you gonna wear that today at Sammy's birthday party in the park?
here's better question for you.
what business is it of yours what I wear to my son's birthday party?
Hello?
it's me.
listen, I need your help.
please, Annie.
vic's been lying to me, to all of us, this entire time.
he's involved somehow.
can you keep an eyeon rose and little Sammy while I sort this out?
Sam, I promised lee I would go to his cousin's wedding today.
look, it's just for a few hours, okay?
all right.
Thanks.
have central raise me on the radio if you need me.
Hey, Sam, be careful.
I'm worried about you.
I'm not the one you should be worried about.
talk to you later.
excuse me, son.
Thanks, uncle Butchie.
Hey, you spoil that kid, Butchie. You know that?
Ah, he's a kid worth spoiling.
go ahead. Play the game.
uncle Butchie?
only my friends call me that.
I'm--I'm, uh, a friend of Vic Tyler's.
do you know him?
sure I do.
he comes in here with his kid Sammy all the time.
but, uh, I doubt I'll be seeing him much now, uh, not after what happened last night.
first rule of the world--don't make the wrong men mad.
that's it for the week?
Sam, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?
I'm at Sammy's birthday party at rowan park, in the woods.
I'm on my way. Keep an eye on 'em till I get there.
if you see Vic Tyler, don't approach him.
radio me immediately.
I can't let him get away...
not again.
Annie, where are you?
Annie, I've lost Tyler.
you got him?
A-Annie, 10-5 that.
you're breaking up.
vic's making his way into the woods.
I'm going in after him.
No! No, listen to me.
Annie, do not follow him.
he's dangerous.
excuse me, sir.
have you seen my dad?
I don't know where he is.
go back to your mother.
I'm gonna go and find your father.
Sammy, come on! It's time to blow out your candles.
coming.
stop!
you hurt?
I'm fine.
don't know if I can say the Same for him.
go back to the party.
radio for backup. Sam
I need you to go back to the party, Annie.
now.
fine, but if you're not back in five minutes, I'm coming back in.
I know, uh...
I know how this looks, Sam.
I left the station'cause I just didn't think that you could protect me and my family from the Pignatos.
Yeah, I just had to get them-- -save it.
I know the truth.
I know you were trying to flee.
I know you kidnapped the baby.
come on.
I wasn't gonna hurt him.
just...
trying to get a little extra money so that my family could live comfortably.
I mean, you got no idea what it's like not being able to provide for your family.
you can't use them as an excuse anymore, Vic.
this was never about at your family needs.
you weren't on the road being a salesman.
you were expanding your criminal concerns.
you told my mother we were broke, so she wouldn't hassle you about spending so much time away.
your mother?
what you're about to do--walking out on your family like this...
your son's gonna blame himself, and it's gonna affect every meaningful relationship he forms his entire life.
let me tell you something, Sammy.
everything that I do, why I started all this in the first place, came out of a need to take care of my family...
to make sure they were safe.
my wife...
my boy.
being a salesman, it just didn't cut it.
that's a cop-out.
what do you know about it?
what do you really know?
it was my 4th birthday party here at rowan park, and I'd just watched you dance with my mother, and I was about to blow out the candles, and I realized you weren't around.
so I followed you into the woods, and I saw you beating a policewoman to death.
you strangled her, then you kicked herand you kicked her.
and then you fledand you never came back.
but I blocked it out.
I blocked it out until I came here.
the memory...
the memory was just too painful.
tell me something, boy.
did you have a good time at your 4th birthday party?
no.
and I didn't become an astronaut, either.
police?
not me.
not a chance.
there are no Pignato brothers.
I could say yes, but that...
wouldn't betelling the truth.
what's the truth?
I am the Pignato brothers.
Hey, you okay?
you're not gonna shoot me, Vic.
what makes you so sure?
cause that's not who you really are.
well, maybe not, but I'm not gonna let you arrest me.
right?
I'm not gonna have my boy knowing his father's in prison for doing terrible things.
I can't do that.
right? I mean, I got--I gotta think of Sammy.
right?
dad?
high five.
Sam, can you hear me?
do you know your name?
where are you, Sam?
new yorkity.
what year is it?
so...
that woman you saw running through the woods, the one in the red dress...
what about her?
thank you for saving my life.
you know, I thought this was the reason I was here, to stop my dad from leaving, but...
I think maybe it was to show me who he really was.
I mean...
wh-what other reason could there be?
you have no idea how much good you've brought to the 1-2-5.
all the cases that you've worked on-- they're the reason you're here.
you should know...
I don't hate everything about this place.
you should rest.
I left you some puzzle books on the table.
happy birthday, Sam.
when you get stuck on a puzzle you can't solve, the key is always in the bottom right-hand corner.
all the cases you've worked on--they're the reason you're here...
you're here...
you're here.
the key is always in the bottom right-hand corner.
once you figure that out, the mystery-- it just unfolds.
35 stewart drive...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Sam.
you can hear me?
of course I can hear you.
you're doing a good job, Sam.
but I need you to do something for me.
who is this?
I need you to go to the basement.
Why? -The basement, Sam--across the room, behind you.
I need you to go down to the basement, Sam.
how do we know where we belong?
we define ourselves by our connections with others, with people we see and interact with every day.
Sam, you've been the victim of violence.
there is a reason the department orders officers sho in the line of duty to undergo psychological evaluations.
it's because we often have unpredictable reactions to stressful situations.
I know. But what I just discussed... was just a dream.
you understand?
a dream of being frozen in time.
actually, everyone else was frozen.
I - I was kinda, you know, movin' around.
that is textbook post - trauma behavior.
you've put up emotional walls.
you are reluant, even frightened, to let people in.
isn't that right?
maybe? I - I don't - - I don't know.
you need to tear down these walls, Sam.
reach out to people you care about.
let them into your world. You're not in Hyde anymore.
it's time to start making this place feel like home.
I guess he made sense.
maybe I should start acting like I'm gonna stick around for a while, you know?
you know, that's great, Sam.
seems like you're working out a lot of your issues.
issues. You think I have issues?
I think you have more issues than "life" magazine.
that's funny, Annie. - I know.
Hey, I was thinking, maybe we could go for a cappuccino sometime.
if I knew what a cappuccino was, I might say yes.
it's just fancy coffee.
cappuccino. Do they drink those a lot in 2008?
mm, it's more of a '90s thing.
uh... I just, um... You know, after everything that's happened and being here in 19, uh... New york...
you've been a good friend.
you too, Sam.
as junior cub scout around here, Skelton, you're losing a merit badge over this.
all the closed - circuit places that are showing the fight have been sold out for a month, you know?
no excuse. We've only been talking about this since Norton - Ali I.
you should've been on top of this.
what about you, Tyler? You get your ticket to "broken jaw"?
mm, no. I got a feeling Ali's already got this one in the bag.
Really?
cause I'm wondering how many more jawbones Norton has to break before Ali is all washed up.
care to back that up, Ray?
20 bucks.
make it 40.
Tyler... I saw frazier floor Ali at the garden in 71.
a powder - puff had him seeing stars.
but I'd be happy to take your money.
in a head - to - head match, Rocky Marciano would'venocked them all out.
I saw him drop "jersey" joe walcott with his suzy Q... To take the title in 55.
a thing of beauty.
Hey, Loot, got some guy tying up the phone all mornin'.
says he wants to speak to the man in charge of the detectives.
who is it? - Wouldn't say.
take a message, Phyliss, would you?
he's making threats.
you mind?
give it here.
lieutenant Gene Hunt speaking. What do you want?
this is an official statement to the imperialist pigs from the foot soldiers of the weather uerground.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
well, this imperialist pig is busy. Get to the point.
we act on this date in response to continued American tyranny and oppression at home and abroad.
these bombings are a strike to the heart of the U. S. Gestapo organization.
what?
what d you just say? What bombings?
a hell of a blast.
took out windows up and down the block.
Glenister's.
they blew up Glenister's. Are you kidding me?
what's Glenister's? A bar?
it's more like a national monument.
61 years pouring booze into cops.
served up a mean steak and eggs, too, with a vodka chaser and a beer chaser - chaser.
for the love of god.
four males, one female. At least two were employees.
Chris, get a canvass started. Find some witnesses.
let's go. Over here.
okay, guys, I need you to move back. There's nothing to see.
the hell there ain't. - Just get behind the barricade, okay? Thank you.
who could've done this?
that phone call.
the weathermen claimed responsibility.
I'm guessing you don't mean the guys who say it's gonna rain.
the weather underground - - student radicals, terrorists, good - for - nothing, taking - for - granted, spoiled know - it - alls... With bombs.
this is bad, boss.
three of them were ours - - James Bolan, Mike Sadowski... Clark krasner.
he knew them. - Yeah.
you got an official cause and origin yet, chief?
the detonation point was inside by the bar.
the burn patterns suggest a flammable liquid like kerosene was also used.
which is why it took out the whole building.
very good, detective.
we bagged some pieces.
it looks like it's from an alarm clock.
that is old - school.
even al qaeda's known to use electronic timers.
al who? - Never mind.
you all right?
they good friends of yours?
we were gonna watch the fight together.
I'm sorry.
we drank these special drinks that, when made correctly, had smoke rise out of the glass.
Kraz invented 'em.
called them "burning questions."
the wires went quiet on these mooks.
bugged out of their last safe house.
that's why they're called weather underground - - hit the campuses, the coffeehouses shake down anyone with a button on their blouse or a bumper sticker on their banjo.
you said the caller mentioned bombs... Plural?
we gotta find these guys before they hit again.
if there's a reason why Glenister's was targeted, it might tell us where they're gonna hit next.
it seems pretty straightforward to me.
they're targeting cops.
burn the mother down!
we've got to bring the war home!
we've got to destroy white privilege!
we've got to break down the barriers of class... Start a free society!
you feeling me, Sam?
Sam, why are they doing this?
WHARE they blowing up the fuzz, man?
can't you help us, Sam?
you gotta save the pigs.
you've gotta save the big pig.
you think it's gonna be a long, long time, rocket man?
my name is Sam Tyler.
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.
I don't know how or why I'm here, but whatever's happened, it's like i've landed on a different planet.
now maybe if I can work out the reas, I can get home.
as far as we could tell, Glenister's was targeted because it was a cop bar.
your dad and them was... Just in the wrong place, wrong time.
except they were in that wrong place all the time.
must run in the family, huh?
the, uh, army engineers told me the mines in that paddy were cleared.
you didn't see them much no more?
no, they were retired. I'm still on the job.
our schedules... But we was gonna watch the fight.
yeah? And get pasted on those ridiculous drinks on fire?
burning questions.
you remember?
your father loved you very much, Danny.
he told me many times how proud of you he was.
Yeah.
he never mentioned it to me.
but me and pop didn't have much to say to each other these days.
he was proud of me when I ran that kickoff back 98 yards to win state in 67 remember that?
I sure do.
we all went out for lobster after.
he was proud of me when I enlisted, too.
sure was.
do you know what?
that pride was gone when I came back in this chair.
Danny... - no, it was. It was.
that's why he kept on working on cases even after he retired.
couldn't stand to be in the Same room as his busted - up son.
things are supposed to be done, you got a cripple in your house.
light switches lowered, ramps put in... 14 months I'm home, and I'm still carrying around this flashlight.
God forbid I'd come home, and it's night and the lights are off.
I'm sorry. - Don't be.
I hear that line so much, it doesn't even mean anything anymore.
surveillance reports, photos, suspect files - - this all came from krasner's home?
I thought he was retired.
the weather underground were sort of an obsession of his.
kind of ironic that he was killed by them, don't you think?
not necessarily.
he had many obsessions.
who is this guy?
his name is Rodney Slaven.
I saw footage of him leading a demonstration.
look at his eyes. They're different colors.
pretty cool.
like david bowie.
maybe we should look into him.
I'll call B. O.S. S.I.See what they can dig up.
they might have something on him. - Great.
this is like one big cardboard hard drive.
got somethin' here, boss.
professor Pat Olsen teaches a poli - sci course at columbia univerty.
the name of the course - - "the role of the radical subversive in the enlightenment of our epoch."
sounds angry.
here's a list of his "a" students.
no coincidence that they're also active members of the weathermen.
this goes back to '68.
you know what they say.
those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach... Inspire extreme revolutionary fervor.
bring this guy in.
he and I need to have a talk.
we're looking for professor Pat Olsen.
you can't just barge in here, man.
not too bright, are you, professor?
let him go.
mind your own business, sugar mouth, then you won't be minding mine.
except this is my business.
not where I come from, it ain't.
well, tell me, where you come from, is "Pat" sometimes short for "Patricia"?
see if you can get that cleaned up, Petey.
and leave the keys under the visor.
the professor's a twirl?
looky, looky.
I know you.
you're Gene Hunt.
because every autocracy needs a tyrant.
I am not a tyrant.
I am a dictator. Big difference.
do I get to call a lawyer, or is it straight to the jackboots and the truncheon?
stick the professor in lost and found.
who did that to your car, boss?
kids! Kids did this.
it's what higher learning does.
they major in stupid with a minor in idiot.
you want a soda while we talk, Professor Olsen?
don't call me professor.
we're clearly not in my classroom.
okay.
Patricia then.
pat. Patty. Trish. Tricia. Which do you prefer?
you do know you've kidnapped me without cause or warrant.
you don't know why you're in here? - No.
don't shine us on, Pat - Patty - Trish - Tricia.
don't do that.
is it really matter what I do or say?
you'll beat a confession out of me if you have to, won't you?
I will.
it's what we call in this line of work "the perks."
okay. A bar called Glenister's was bombed this morning.
I heard. What does it have to do with me?
five people were killed.
that interest you at all?
three of them cops - - men I knew. Good men.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I am... If they were, as you say, good men.
however, I remain dubious.
Dubious? Dubious about what?
that in this day and age there are such a thing... As cops who are good men.
maybe I will have that soda now.
let me tell you about my good buddy clark who died.
I stood with him when he married his bride Millie.
I stood with him 30 years later when he buried her.
we toasted the birth of his son together.
he was eight months retired.
that's terribly sad, but I'm sure adolf eichmann and josef goebbels had similar stories of friendship and loss.
the weathermen are behind the bombing.
disciples of yours, I understand.
some of them were former students, that's all.
I don't know anything about a bombing. I want to talk to my husband.
the weather underground is planning another bombing today.
you hear anything about that from your former students?
if you're mixed up in this, we will build a case against you, Professor Olsen. That I promise.
this happened to one of my students - - a champion tennis player.
now he'll never play again because cops like you broke his arm to railroad him for an armed robbery.
I know how you work.
you've already made up your mind about my guilt.
out of curiosity, are you right - handed or left - handed?
Where's my wife? I wanna speak to my wife.
Hey, pal, you can't just barge in here.
I wanna speak to my wife right now! - Who's your wife?
professor Patricia Olsen.
goons from this precinct kidnapped her right out of her classroom.
Mr. Olsen - - Dr. Olsen.
Dr. Richard Olsen.
Dr. Olsen, your wife is being questioned at the moment regarding an ongoing investigation.
now if you and your ughter will just have a seat, i'll let the detectives know you're here.
what's your name?
Laura. - Laura, would you like a chocolate bar?
I think there's one left in the vending machine.
Yes, please.
okay. Well, at some point, we're gonna run out of time on this situation.
and at that point, the Loot will beat the truth out of the professor if he has to.
I'm talking about the boxing match, Ray. - Yeah.
skelton, you have a call.
detective Skelton. 1 - 2 - 5.
what did you just say? What did you say?
do I know you, chucklehead?
where is my wife, Professor Patricia Olsen?
Oh, the professor.
well, in case you didn't know it, pal, your wife is a terrorist.
now sit down before I lock you up, too.
okay. Come on, pal. Let's get you a seat.
you know what? Take your hands off me.
ray, I just got a call from communications.
there's another situation - - another bomb situation.
let's go.
step back.
what is that?
that's the bomb squad, Tyler.
that's your bomb squad?
what, you didn't have bomb squads at Hyde?
we did, but they weren't basket weavers.
boss, you might not wanna go back there. It's still live.
boss.
what's he doing?
that's his guy.
thank the lord in heaven it's you.
God help me, pal, I'm so scared, I can't me.
my arm is numb, my ass is asleep.
I peed myself.
how long you been sittin' here, Rooney?
all damn day.
I heard about the glen.
so I'm heading to the scene, but I turn this key halfway and I - I hear this
this click under my seat like I never heard before - - loud click.
hunt, don't leave me here. Don't leave me.
I'm not going anywhere.
Yeah.
the lieutenant can't be here.
what happened to them... To Boles and Ski and Kraz?
did they get hurt?
let's get you out of this, then we'll talk.
Aw, man.
who, Gene? Which one of the guys?
it's me and you now, Roons.
why are they coming after us?
I need you guys to stand back here.
come on, Gene. - I'm not goin' anywhere.
don't - - boss... Don't leave me.
stayin' with my guy.
stayin' with the Roons.
please, lieutenant.
please, stand back.
lieutenant, you gotta step back.
no, sir! No, sir!
Hey, Ray... The guy with the ponytail - - I saw him outside Glenister's.
are you sure? - Absolutely.
stayin' with my guy. - Get him outta here!
that's my Gene.
No! No! Gene! Just stay easy.
go easy, detective. Try to stay calm.
do your job, son. Do your job.
he said they were coming after you.
who's coming after you, Gene?
who's coming after you?
Rodney Slaven - - he's like a rock star.
Yeah.
look at those eyes.
we gotta get back out there.
they're not finished.
Sam, should I be calling my family and friends, telling them to get out of the city?
if you let these people scare you - - I know, I know.
the terrorists win.
I was gonna say they'll always have the advantage, but that's catchy.
Thankswell, he's one you don't have to worry about.
Rodney Slaven died a year ago.
he O. D.'D.
he's dead? - He is.
Yeah.
um, look, check this out.
there's the professor in the crowd.
she's one of them - - the weathermen.
and... This is the guy Chris saw at both bombings - - Eric Larson.
we need to send out an alarm.
it can be just a coincidence that four of Hunt's friends on the job were all on the receiving end of weathermen bombs today.
hunt knows a lot of cops.
Yeah, but this wasn't random.
I mean, they were all targets.
there's gonna be another bomb.
Arthur Rooney helped to protect the city for over 40 years, and you blew him up!
you... Blew... Him... Up!
you... Blew... Him... Up!
stop!
if this woman doesn't tell me who's responsible for killing those men,
I'm gonna punch her so hard, down on Canal Street, they'll be stepping over her smirk.
I understand.
come here.
look at these.
we got eyewitnesses placing this man, Eric Larson, at the scene of both bombings.
we got wire transcripts, manifestos, fake I. D.S.
you name it, all proving your connection to the weather underground.
conspiracy to commit murder.
that's major time upstate, Professor Olsen.
and cop killings?
that adds to the jolt.
where did you get these?
you give us the names of the other targets, and you'll be looking at a lot less jail time.
you might even be out in time to see your daughter off to college.
my daughter is the reason I do what I do.
I don't want her growing up in a world where imperialist pigs waow in their own excrement.
all the children in the city are the reason I do what I do!
look, trust me when I say this, you won't be remembered as heroes.
you'll be seen as spoiled thugs, hoodlums... Terrorists.
it's terrorism when I stand up for my rights?
tell me, why is it that government - sanctioned violence is tolerated?
america slaughtered a million Vietnamese civilians without even blinking, and I'm the criminal?
the people you killed today were innocent.
anyone who isn't part of the revolution can't be considered innocent.
the people you killed stood up for this city.
other than being imperialist pigs, what possible reason could you have had to take their lives?
they were part of something they shouldn't have been a part of.
what - - what are you talking about?
he knows what I'm talking about.
he ran the group.
the red squad.
get out.
boss? Boss, what's she talking about?
me and the professor need to chat some more.
get out.
I promise I won't kill her... Yet.
ray, I've been looking for you.
Yeah, I'm working on finding a current address for larson, but so far, no dice.
better hope Hunt can get that loon to sing.
otherwise, we're gonna have bigger problems than where to watch the fight.
well, Hunt just kicked me out.
who knows what the hell kind of medieval thumb screws he's using on the professor.
kicked you out?
What'd you do, spaceman, take her side?
ray, listen.
you ever hear about the Loot running some group called, uh... The red squad?
red squad?
Yeah. - Yeah, I heard rumors.
nothin' involving the Loot.
supposedly they were a group of lawmen that ran under - the - radar surveillance on radical groups.
supposedly?
bit of a myth, like, uh, the tooth fairy or mermaids.
it never really existed - - just a ploy to keep the hippies paranoid.
let the Loot have his time. He ain't gonna hurt her.
he's just gonna have her think he's gonna hurt her.
he's been running interrogations since the night Samson met Delilah.
yeah?
I was doing my due diligence - - following up on the Rodney Slaven autopsy report.
I thought Slaven died of a drug overdose.
he did, but it wasn't heroin.
according to the report, hydromorphone was the drug that killed him.
pharmaceutical grade.
enough to put down an elephant.
hydromorphone. That's not really a street drug, is it?
I thought it was odd. And another thing... - what?
look at the date of death on the report.
he died exactly one year ago today.
he died or he was killed.
so on the anniversary of his death, four cops get blown up.
like I said, I thought it was odd.
I've had your names ever since the weathermen infiltrated your offices.
you terrorized them, dangled them by their ankles outside of windows, threw tear gas grenades into their homes, and when that didn't work, let's just say nobody knows better than me the lengths you'd go to.
look, professor... If the red squad did exist, I'm sure their goal was to protect the public from collegiate communists who were trying to overthrow the government and burn the city down.
boss? - What?
I need to ask Pat a few questions.
two minutes, that's it.
five seconds over, and your ass is outta here.
I had no idea the whole "good cop, bad cop" thing was more than just the stuff of old police dramas.
how well did you know Rodney Slaven?
we were friends.
was Slaven a junkie?
he never touched the stuff his whole life.
but he died of a drug overdose, didn't he?
exactly one year ago today.
he didn't die of an overdose. They just wanted it to look that way.
they?
who's they?
you should know better than anyone, Hunt.
ne, Gene. Gene!
gene, Gene... Can we... For a moment?
listen, I can see a scenario where the red squad might've found it necessary to get rid of one dangerous radical to protect the city.
you think the red squad murdered Rodney Slaven?
I'm just saying I can see how it could've happened, based on the surveillance coming out of these boxes.
Tyler, they may have tuned him up, beat him up, framed him up or called him dirty names.
but no way in hell my cops shot him up with junk to kill him.
maybe Rooney, Kasner and the rest did it without you knowing.
nobody does anything without me knowing.
either way, she thinks you were a member of the red squad, which means we already know the target of the next bomb.
it's you.
yeah?
I was thinking... Maybe you should get out of town, go somewhere sunny, you know?
till we find Larson.
my ex - wife's been trying to kill me for 20 years.
so to hell with the professor and her weathermen.
there have been spiders crawling up my wall i've been more afraid of.
what are you hovering for?
don't you got an investigation to conduct?
gene, give me a straig answer.
who were the red squad?
the last of the hard men.
a dying breed.
but they weren't murderers.
that I know.
our coffee is the worst form of torture we've got.
you must miss him a lot.
who? - Rodney Slaven.
why do you say that?
he was a friend of yours, wasn't he?
he was.
how long did you know him?
is this another form of interrogation?
not at all.
it's just two women talking.
I met him when he was 18.
he... Arrived on campus ready to set the world ablaze with his ideas.
he inspired a lot of people.
he did.
he could've done important things with his life.
Rodney was... fond of quoting the jazz musician Charlie Parker
who said, "you learn all the notes and the chords and the scales "and you practice them and practice them until you get them right, and then you throw all that crap away and you just wail.
Rodney was just beginning to wail when those men killed him.
your daughter and your husband are out there.
when can I see them?
I'm gonna have to check with the detectives.
what?
what is it?
pat Olsen was in love with Rodney Slaven.
how do you know that? - Women know these things.
she loved him.
well, she'll have plenty of time to reflect on her broken heart in prison.
no, no, no, Sam, there's more.
what?
Dr. Olsen, this is detective Tyler.
detective, Dr. Richard Olsen.
look, what - - what's happening?
I just want to see my wife.
um, we're still questioning her, doctor.
and, Sam, have you met Laura?
you gotta save the pigs.
those eyes.
is my mother going to be okay?
you wanna kill somebody else today, professor?
is that gonna make your daughter proud of you?
you're a selfish woman, you hear me?
you're a selfish piece of crap!
and one of these days you're gonna wake up, and your daughter's gonna be the real victim here.
your daughter. Now where is that last bomb?
tell me, professor! - Gene, let go of her.
where can we find Eric Larson?
I would like very much to see my daughter.
larson planted those bombs, didn't he?
I won't betray the cause, detective.
I don't regret anything I've done.
I wanna kill this woman, Sam.
I do.
I won't, because I could never commit murder.
but I want to... Very badly.
I want to kill this woman, Sam.
are you okay? Are you hurt? - I'm fine, Richard.
thank god you're here.
they are maniacs. This one - - quite possibly the worst person I have ever encountered.
Where's Laura?
she - - she's outside.
take a seat, Dr. Olsen.
Why? What for?
just take a seat.
it's okay.
one year ago today, someone killed Rodney Slaven with a hot shot of hydromorphone that stopped his heart.
and contrary to what you might believe, Professor Olsen...
the red squad had nothing to do with it.
contrary to what you believe, detective, Rodney was not a junkie.
but the hydromorphone was pharmaceutical grade.
Yes, the kind that well - connected cops have easy access to.
as do doctors... In hospitals.
according to the investigation, there was no sign of forced entry to Slaven's apartment.
suggesting Slaven knew the man who killed him.
you knew she was having an affair with Slaven, didn't you?
didn't you?
I did.
Why? I mean, I know you always thought he was a genius, but does that make me stupid?
what I didn't know is how long it had gone on.
I stayed away from Slaven and pat's radical friends, but... About a year or so ago,
I... I ran into Rodney... At the greengrocer...
and I saw his eyes.
I saw his eyes, and I knew those eyes.
I knew them... Because they were...
because they wereyour daughter's eyes.
I loved her like my own - - your bastard child.
no.
four officers are dead over a domestic squabble?
I never realized that you'd go this far, Patricia, and not over politics, not over some cause, but for love?
who insisted - - who insisted that you couldn't be fully mine while in the middle of a revolution.
you're a hypocrite.
a phony.
stop!
that poor little girl.
this whole thing had nothing to do with her.
and everything to do with her.
only thing I can tell you, as this crowd starts getting warmed up for this big fight...
what are you guys doing here?
s it look like we're doing, Tyler?
the fight starts in 45 minutes, and thanks to Chris over here, these are our ringside seats.
but I'm ordering pizza.
Yeah, big deal.
um, so are you guys looking for a place to watch the fight?
Yeah.
I know a place.
thank god it's still the undercard!
how did you know about this place, spaceman?
well, you know, I live around the corner.
I walk bit. I don't go in.
Oh, you're a saint.
there was a big sign that said the fight was on, so...
you know, uh, one day you're not gonna have to come to a strip bar to watch a fight.
well, that's a day I hope I never see.
Hey, I'm feeling so confident about Norton, what do you say we triple the bet?
you're on.
I'm a sucker for the underdog.
all right.
not bad, huh, Danny?
great.
I'm sorry about your dad.
I'm glad you could make it, Gene. - Thank you.
I'm glad you brought your friend. - Appreciate it.
sorry to hear about your dad. - Thanks a lot.
no problem thank you.
and what have we here?
two "burning questions" for you guys.
made to order.
run back there, honey, and have them make one more for my friend here.
I think you know, Sam, that when things we care about go away, it can be easy to forget our place in the journey.
that's why I think I'm ready to start living... Here, in 1973.
how did you come to that conclusion?
because there are some things here that make breaking down those walls absolutely worthwhile.
because I think I have to begin to make peace with the now.
but I have to tell you, doctor, that...
as long as I'm here...
I can never, ever stop trying to find my way home.
technology will change the earth.
and this is the future right here.
you want to watch "the exorcist" from the comfort of your own couch?
they'll get $1, 500 each on the blackarket, easy.
I want to get this done quick-like.
screw it up, you might as well slit your own throats and throw yourselves into the Hudson.
top o' the morning to you, big patrick.
get down!
lose the guns, leprechauns!
get on the ground!
get 'em boys! Get 'em!
there are always a few that think they're faster.
not usually the Irish!
the Italians like a good sprint.
there you go.
and there you go again.
that's for making me remember I had asthma when I was a kid.
all right?
shut your mouth and keep walking.
it's Bono, you scuzzy knacke it's Irish.
my name is sam tyler.
I was in an accident, and I woke up in 1973.
I don't know how or why I'm here, but whatever's happened, it's like I've landed on a different planet.
now maybe if I can work out the reason,
I can get home.
let's move it, ya bums.
look at that.
I love a woman in uniform.
I bet you have a very fine set of fun bags nestled warmly there, huh?
like two ferrets fighting in a sack.
Oh, the beautiful irish boys you'd bear, huh?
not much in the way of birthing hips, though, does she?
no, the skinny ones never disappoint me, Patrick.
mind your manners, junior.
apologize to the lady.
there's a difference between bravery and stupidity.
now apologize.
sure.
sorry, love.
let's go.
I'll give you points for realism, Tyler.
but next time you elbow me in the gut,
I ain't pulling my own punches.
sorry about that, boss.
Yeah.
you had me really thinkin' you were Irish.
you're good at accents, like rich Little.
what the hell you been doing these past two weeks?
you smell like flipper after a 5-day herring bender.
Yeah, well, I look like a longshoreman who's been unloading ships full of fish all day.
what do you got besides blisters?
well, big patrick's been cherry-picking guys off the docks for covert jobs.
we were off loading these black market V. C.R...
R.
,uh, those gizmos, when you guys arrived.
what about Jim Mcmanus?
McManus hasn't made an appearance yet, but I heard some talk about that truck hijacking three weeks ago.
it was Mcmanus and his crew who jacked that trucoad of electronics.
I knew it.
Yeah, well, the truck hasn't turned up yet.
rumor is Mcmanus himself pulled the trigger on the driver's murder.
it fits his vicious M. O.
pumped fourounds into a lifeless body when anyone else would have stopped at two.
like I said, it's just hearsay.
you get closer, you watch yourself.
McManus has been known to sniff out less noble rats before.
he has marshmallow guns, knives and coffins in his bowl of lucky charms every morning.
he's magically malicious.
fair warning.
fair warning, Tyler.
okay I better get back out there.
get him back to his chums.
Oh, boss, uh, one more thing
maybe I should get a shiner or somethin' for appearance's sake.
Yeah, you should.
ray. - Yeah.
you got it.
there aren't any ashtrays in here, are there?
what are you doin'?
Oh, boy.
stand up.
you picked, go to the right.
you ain't, go to the left.
skelton - is that an Irish name?
Yeah.
you became a cop.
you must have made your mama so proud, huh?
okay, homebound goes left, floppers go to the right.
you, homebound.
homebound.
flopper.
homebound.
flopper.
who's the scrappy one?
all right. All right. Come on.
easy there.
scrappy, come on with us.
back off, scrappy.
back off. All right?
come on. Sit down and have a drink with me.
you got a name, or you want me to call you scrappy?
Dublin-the accent?
Yeah. Sandycove.
there was a place my pop used to talk about called the, uh, the fifty foot.
said it was a nice swim spot then.
you familiar?
uh, I think you mean the forty foot.
For-what was I thinking?
man, what was I thinking?
you got a brain on you. I like that.
I tell you what.
let me introduce you to some of the boys, huh?
here, these mooks.
we got Patrick.
another Patrick. - Patrick.
that's Sean. - Sean.
and this here is drunk Petey.
Jimmy boy.
can I trouble you for a pint?
your sister ain't having it.
she cut me off clean.
Yeah. That's because you're a serious neddy, drunk Petey.
come on. Piss off, okay?
business discussion here, okay?
with this muck savage? - Oh, no.
yodel yo. - co on, drunk Petey. Let's go.
so you good with anything aside from those, uh, elbows?
name it.
how about your dukes?
anyone, anyhow, anywhere.
okay, what about right now? Patrick?
easy.
no. Big patrick.
Hey, Paddy boy.
no here says he can crush you, fist to fist.
is that right? - Yeah.
go easy on him, okay?
come on, Paddy!
come on, Paddy!
come on!
come on!
wow, Sammy.
in Irish tarot, that - that's a symbol of possibility.
cool, right?
hello.
mommy's home!
Hey, there's eggs in the B.
Hello, my sweetie.
I thought I said no more readings.
you know they only confuse him.
I know. Okay?
but he got the ace of pentacles.
what does that mean?
it means he can make all your dreams come true.
glad you're here.
you know, I was scared we'd run out of drunken Irish hoodlums today.
this is my joint.
I'm - Colleen.
Yeah, that's right. How'd you know?
Oh, I-I overheard a couple of lads going on about a bottle of smoke that works the bar here, named Colleen.
well, pick yourself up.
dust yourself off.
you're a good 2 pints behind the masses.
you through playing nursemaid?
hump off.
two rules, Bono
Twrules that keep anarchy and chaos outside of this bar.
One-we're a family first and foremost, and don't you forget that.
and two-don't even think about making nice-y with my sister.
here you go.
Yeah, that'll ease the pain.
Jimmy? - Yes?
when will I get some work?
eh, relax your cacks, okay?
I do admire your enthusiasm.
no, I'll tell you what.
go to this address tonight at 7: 00. Okay?
be on time.
tell 'em jimmy sent you, and you follow their instructions to the letter.
thanks for this, boss.
Thanks, boss?
you say that like I just handed you a glass of water.
all right, listen, listen, listen. Don't talk.
here's the thing, Bono... - Why are you reading the obituaries?
the least they could do, you know, print their last words, don't you think?
the toughest men I ever seen croak
I'm talking about the diamond-hard bastards, the stone-cold killers
you know what their final words were?
mommy. Mommy.
I don't just put anybody on my team...
hey ray, You believe in hell?
Yeah.
Sunday dinner at my mother-in-law's with her new friend gus, who has a goiter and an undercooked ham.
come on. I'm serious.
I am, too.
the goiter and the uercooked ham look very similar.
I'm always afraid I'm gonna stick my fork into the wrong pinkish blob.
in hell, you think they got flames everywhere?
you want hell?
I'll give you hell.
hell is sitting three hours on a stakeout with a jibber-jawing jackass who's come down with a bad case of "what's it all about, alfie?"
this is interesting.
Jimmy sent me, said I should follow your instructions.
come on in.
so...
are you as good with a hammer as you are with your hands?
well, uh, that depends on the job.
do you know what I mean?
hanging a mirror?
Yeah.
that brother of mine - he's got some sense of humor.
I'll go get a hammer.
detective skywalker?
what-what are you doing here?
Hey, Rose.
there you are.
Sam, this is, uh, this is Rose Tyler, my new neighbor and friend and the mother of the most beautiful little boy you've ever seen in your life.
uh, rose, this is Sam Bono.
uh, nice to meet you...Sam.
bono. Sam Bono.
well, Sam works for Jimmy.
Yep. Nice to meet you, Rose.
any friend of Colleen's here is me auld segotia.
uh, your accent...
it's driving you wild, huh?
Yeah, you and the rest of the lashes.
you know, do you want a drink, Sam?
only if you want to see a grown man overcome with gratitude.
what is going on?
I'm workg a case, undercover.
please don't blow it for me.
what are you doing here?
no, what are you doing here?
I-I just moved in next door.
you know, with Vic gone, the rent on the old place was...
well, a smaller apartment was all we needed, and-and Colleen watches Sammy sometimes, when I have to work late.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I-I really should get going.
you know, it's gonna take me forever to get Sammy to leave.
I think he has a crush on Colleen.
I think so, too.
well, I mean, who wouldn't?
find a pay phone?
Yeah. I spoke to Annie.
this address is where Jimmy's sister lives.
what, the bartender?
Oh, man, she is one witchy wildcat.
you ever seen her? - No.
how come Tyler gets all the plumb undercovers?
we get diamond district rabbis and busboys.
remeer when we had to pose as nursing home workers?
still got the smell of granny poo on my loafers.
I bet he's up there right now, getting "in" her "cognito."
Slinte.
well, I think it's about time we hung the mirror.
look who's awake.
Hey, Sammy.
Hey, sweetheart.
Oh, are you ready to go home?
Sammy, this is Sam.
Sam, this is Sammy.
nice to meet you, kid.
all right, say- say good night, Sammy.
good night.
good night. - Good night, yeah.
Thanks, Colleen. - Sure.
God, can you believe you were ever that young?
no.
sometimes I think irrived here fully grown.
so, uh...
do you still shuffle an Irish tarot deck, do you?
I do.
how do you know that?
Oh, uh, one of Jimmy's boys mentioned it.
they thought it was odd.
well, you know what? If any one of them had an ounce of the mystic in them, maybe they wouldn't be so all-day angry.
it takes a keen eye to hang a mirror.
a little bit too much to the left, a little bit too much to the right, and it all gets banjaxed.
well, clearly Jimmy hired the right man for the job.
well, I should be off.
detective skywalker.
uh, or sam or whoever you are right now.
I'm-I'm sorry about that.
I just wanted to see how you guys are doin'.
Oh, we're fine.
well, aside from the fact that my son thinks his father's on a very long business trip.
and I don't know when or how to tell him otherwise.
um, is-is Colleen in some kind of trouble?
if so, I'd really like to know.
well, all--all I can say is that her brother's mixed up in some shady stuff.
so do me a favor.
stay away from her, okay?
okay, I'll do that...
thank you. - If you'll do something for me.
of course. Anything.
will you talk to Sammy?
talk to him?
I...
about what?
I'm worried.
he's changed since his father left.
you know, he's angry.
he threw a rock at a neighborhood boy last week.
you were right, detective, about Vic.
you warned me, and you were right.
Sammy needs a man in his life, a good man, like you.
just to talk to.
I'm doing everything I can, but...
rose. - Will you will you please just-just talk to him?
please.
it would mean so much to sammy and to me.
I'm sorry. I,um...
I'm sorry.
I really want to help you, but I can't do that.
okay.
I'm not sure I understand why, but, um,
I can't say that I'm surprised.
since we've met, you've been nothing but a-a puzzle with several lost pieces.
Oh, Rose. - Thanks anyway.
well, listen. - Just...
I still need you to stay away from Jimmy Mcmanus.
do you understand?
you and Sammy both.
mommy.
I had a bad dream.
he can hardlsleep.
he's afraid of his own dreams.
good night...
Mrs. Tyler.
she was your babysitter. - Yes.
crazy Jimmy Mcmanus' sister, Colleen, was your babysitter back in- no, here in 1973.
that's right.
and I didn't realize it at the time or even later.
in fact, it only just occurred to me when I saw her today.
but she pretty much forged my taste in all the women who came after her.
Really? - Yeah, well, one's formative years being so crucial and a that, you know.
so does Maya look like her?
um, no, not at all.
and now here she is.
she's Jimmy Mcmanus' sister, and she's living next door to my mother, - so I can't help but think - oh, please don't say it.
what? - Don't say "maybe that's why I'm here, " because you keep saying,"maybe that's why I'm here,"
and every time you say it,
I think maybe the reason you're here is to drive me utterly insane.
okay. Look, I know this all seems like nonsense to you, the ravings of a lunatic.
I appreciate that.
you know, you've tried to go there with me, you haven't called the men from the funny farm to take me away.
not yet.
you kept my confidence.
I am so grateful for that.
so I can only promise that if I ever do get back to 2008 or 2009
or wtever the hell it is right now,
I will make it up to you.
I'll take you out for sushi at Nobu.
I will fill your ipod with the entire Justin Timberlake catalog.
I will fly you down to the epcot center to show you the spaceship earth.
okay.
okay? - Okay.
okay. - It's a deal, Sam.
uh, if you ever get back to wherever you're from, you can take me with you and do all those things.
okay. It's a deal.
it's a deal.
what is sushi?
I think that Sam's plan to work the sister has got nothing to do with the case and everything to do with her ass.
I can handle the silent treatment, believe you me.
I married the eldest Stovack sister.
ignoring me for days on end is the favorite weapon in her arsenal.
I ain't gonna crack, Junior.
all right.
fine.
on the subject of the afterlife, here is my opinion
depending on how we behave here on earth, we either go to heaven or go to hell.
in heaven, it's all dancing girls, ice cream sundaes, rivers of bourbon, led zeppelin music, no one's allowed to wear any clothes, you have to have sex at least ten times a day and eat pizza when you're not having sex.
it's like a rule there.
well, so what's hell?
hell is just a great big window you have to sit behind all day long and watch what goes on in heaven.
yodel yo.
Jimmy sleeping one off?
no, he don't get up until the corned beef's on the table.
not that I think you're really here looking for Jimmy.
am I that transparent?
you drinkin'?
always.
what makes you think I want anything from you?
well, men only talk to women for two reasons.
when they want their house cleaned or their mouse cleaned.
true, I could have you any time I wanted.
Oh, you think so?
Oh, I do. - Why?
because you fancy yourself some tough guy?
I mean, do you really think that's appealing to Jimmy Mcmanus' sister?
I mean, I grew up around all these hard shells with their fists and their guns and their anger.
do you think I find that even remotely attractive?
well, I also make, uh, lace curtains out of dried pineapple rings.
you're getting warmer.
woo me.
W-woo you?
I need woo.
not here.
maybe we should go to your place.
Sammy and Rosie live right next door.
what if little Sammy hears?
his bedroom's right against the wall.
trust me.
he won't mind.
so you know, I'm not a loose boot.
I was the only girl at St. Edmund's...St. Spreadmund's Who didn't lose her virginity until she was 16.
St. Spreadmund's.
well, what do you know?
what? What is it?
this is the tower card.
what does that mean?
well, the tower card means that as long as we remain inert, nothing will change, no progress will be made, until we take action.
take action?
Yeah, take action.
no matter how that action might mean the end of everything we deem sacred.
if you could go back in time and talk to yourself as a kid...
would you do it? - Absolutely.
mostly to warn myself about my ex.
you?
I can't do it.
can't?
won't.
I mean, I wouldn't.
facing yourself that young means you can change anything you want in your life with just a few words.
all the painful memories, all the wrong turns...
having that power makes you question every choice you've ever made.
who wants to face that?
what is it?
nothin'.
you're not like any of the thugs in my brother's employ.
you don't kiss like one either.
you kissed many of them, have you?
you really shouldn't let my brother Jimmy know you have brains to go with those good looks.
has he, uh, mentioned anything about...
well, has he mentioned anything?
about what?
about anything, you know, about, uh, me, about what his intentions are.
we don't talk about his business.
I try not to talk about mine.
you've got to be the stupidest idiot ever to walk upright, you know that?
Hey, big Patrick.
Oh, little Patrick, too.
Where's medium-size Patrick?
he have the day off?
Oh, look who it is.
you got anything you wanna tell me?
I got nothin' to say to you you don't already know.
you scuttle my sister.
I take you under my wing, my new prot?
if it was a Patrick or Sean, they'd be meeting my favorite cleaver, I swear to god.
but you...
you got style.
you got something dark in your soul, and I like that.
you could only really work for me.
come have a drink.
here.
have another drink, ah?
let's have a shot or two to welcome you into our little enclave, okay?
Slinte.
wanna see somethin'?
the picture there, with the dog - that's my old man.
nasty S. O.B.
he had these shoes that, uh, when he walked, made this horrible sound.
kinda hard to explain, but like a click-clack-clack, click-click.
you always knew he was comin' down the hall.
the typical Irish sad story.
old man comes home drunk, beats the crap out of me, beats the crap out of Colleen.
he was a rough S. O.B.
all around.
mine, too.
well...
so what did you?
I went down to the docks where he was workin', and he sees me, sees me walkin' up, and he says,"what do you- what do you want, boy?
and I say,"pa, smile."
and I take a tire iron, and I crack his skull two times.
you killed him?
Oh, god, no.
that's my father.
but he's layin' there, and blood's all over his face.
and he looks up, and he says to me,"about time, boy."
about time.
then I'm walkin' away...
and I hear that same sound, the cck-click-clack thing.
and he's still on the ground.
the sound's coming from my own shoes.
cause eventually, we all become our fathers.
there's no getting around it.
I believe we can change who we are.
no way, no change.
we're spurned from their loins.
so whether we like it or not, we wind up just like 'em.
let's have a drink to you...
saving your sister.
I love Colleen.
I love Colleen so much that I can't even put it into words.
I love her more than I love my own heart, which is why it hurts me to my...
Jimmy, come on. Now it wasn't like that.
you know, me and her - we're not...
I'm not talking about you and she and your fornications, okay?
it's got nothing to do with that.
Colleen talked to the cops.
my own sister.
how do you know that?
come on, man. This is crazy.
you don't have to do this.
no, I don't, do I?
you do.
what?
we're talkin' about your future now.
you do the honors.
take the gun.
you're family now.
take the gun!
she ain't worth it.
there you go.
I can't do it.
Sistercide-that's a cross I refuse to bear, and I ain't goin' to hell.
it doesn't have to be like this.
wh, some passionate chumminess, and all of a sudden you're telling me how it's gonna be?
pray tell, what do you say, sister sweet?
Jimmy, I'm no rat!
please, you gotta believe me!
Shh. You're a rat.
my own sister, a rat.
what are you standing over there like a delicate flower for?
shoot her! Come on!
yodel yo yo!
shut up, Petey!
she ain't talkin' to no cops.
I got a gut feeling about it, and my gut feeling's not wrong.
when I tell you to shoot her, you shoot her!
I can guarantee she's not talking to any cops.
guarantee? You can't guarantee anything!
how? - because I am a cop!
come again?
he said he's a cop.
I heard what he said, okay?
it's a rhetorical question, okay?
shut up, moron. You're a pig.
yodel yo yo yo!
Yeah.
I got a badge number an everything--2-4-6.
Jimmy Mcmanus, we want you for murder, extortion, racketeering, armed robbery and for just being a plain, old nasty bastard.
against the wall!
everybody, up against the wall!
move!
against the wall! Let's move! Now!
let's go!
this isn't loaded, is it?
that was great.
damn it!
come on now.
nice job, sis.
nice job. - Thank you.
God bless you. Very nice.
good. You're great.
now it's your turn to get on your knees.
get on your knees.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
get on your knees!
send this rodent to the rain.
you meet any saints along the way, put a good word in for me, please, okay?
we could've been friends.
Where's the car? - It's out back, Jimmy.
I don't need to see this.
you know, there's two kinds of guys that roam the kitchen.
there's crooks, and there's cops.
and as I said before, you don't kiss like no crook.
why couldn't you be real?
police! Get your hands up!
hands up!
McManus went out the back! He went out the back!
Freeze! Drop the gun!
got him! - Get her out of here.
move it.
let's go.
pretty good timing, boss.
the nose knows, huh?
the nose has an inside guy to watch your sorry ass.
"yodel yo" means everything's jake.
"yodel yo yo" means marshall the troops.
"yodel yo yo yo" means get your angry asses in here.
sergeant Pete Cochran.
been under since you been under, except all he needs is whiskey and a wire.
okay.
I-I don't know whether to be flattered or insulted, boss.
I'd go for both.
I trust you enough to worry about you, but I worry about you enough not to trust you.
good work. - Yeah.
McManus is in the wind, loot.
word on the spit is that your brother turned tail and is headed to Celtic town.
what do you know about that?
I don't know nothin'.
you know, thing about a girl like you?
I see you walking down the street, and I may say,
Wow. That's one sexy chick.
but knowing what you're really like...
on the inside...
you're uglier than a photo of a bulldog's hole.
Hey, Bono?
you know, I wonder, do your pals here - do they know who you really are?
they know you have a dark side
how you beat big Patrick to a pulp...
how you lie and pretend to be someone you're not?
shut up.
he's closer to my brother than he is to you.
I said shut up!
I don't know, sugar lips.
he's pretty damn close to me right now.
wallet.
there's a message from Rose Tyler to a commander...
skywalker?
uh, she hopes you'll decide to change your mind.
Oh, yeah.
she's, um...
wants me to speak to her son.
Yeah.
the woman you believe to be your...
your mother...
wants you to talk to yourself?
Yeah, she wants me to speak to...
me.
but I figured if I put it like that, you'd give me one of your epic looks of pity.
why does she want you to talk to you?
apparently, I've...
well, he's...
okay, we've been having trouble ever since my...ever since Vic left.
are you gonna do it?
I don't think so.
what if by me talking to me,
I say the wrong thing, and that wrong thing brings about some kind of tragic result...
some kind of bad ending?
I mean, this is all...
I mean, it's pretty - it's pretty fragile, Annie.
what if the simple act of talking to my younger self brings about...
darkness?
you're trying to remember where you put the phone number of the men from the funny farm right now, aren't you?
it's in my other coat.
you do have to ask yourself, if you don't talk to him, who will?
glad you changed your mind, detective.
Yeah, well, I didn't want just anyone talking to him.
Sam, he's heartbroken about Colleen.
eh, he'll get over it.
sometimes a faasy is better than the reality.
Yeah.
Sammy, I have somebody who wants to talk to you.
he's a policeman.
come on out now.
no.
you know what? Just give us a minute.
I did the same thing when I was his age.
okay.
she's gone. You can come out now.
my name is detective skywalker.
you can call me Luke.
your mom tells me you got into a fight last week.
and the kid you fought with- Jerry Flood
he made fun of you in front of your friends.
so you...
threw a rock at him.
I bet your mom said you were a bad boy, huh?
cause, you know, when I was growing up, my mom said I was a bad boy, too, sometimes.
I guess she was always scared
I'd turn out like my father.
was your father bad, Luke?
my father...
went over to the dark side.
but I know there was still good in him.
and I know that you threw that rock because you're upset that your dad is away on a long business trip.
and now your babysitter Colleen is in...
well, she's...
okay, she's moved to Florida.
but there'll be other babysitters, especially Jenny.
I mean, wow.
Jenny is like...
when you're 10, you're gonna love Jenny.
they're not coming back, are they?
I wouldn't count on it.
people just go away, you know?
it's not your fault.
it's not my fault?
it's not.
it's just life.
life?
life.
this guys' zooted. Hit him with the lights.
people come in and out of our lives, and they help shape who we are.
and we really hope that the good ones stick around.
somebody's having an alkie-holiday.
top of the mornin' to you, lads.
sometimes people go away.
sometimes they just away.
a cop doing time? Please.
office Robert Stark Former Partner of Charlie Crews
broke nearly every bone in his body.
after the case was re-opened, we found that none of the physical evidence on scene matched officer crews.
pelican Bay Penitentiary 1995-2007
Los Angeles Four months later
you know, if you had your own car, I wouldn't have to take you to work.
I don't have a car because you ran it over with a tractor.
not that I was attached to that car.
I was not attached to that car.
but it doesn't matter anyway.
I'll take the bus. I like the bus.
Yeah, but somebody has to take you to the bus.
I'll take him.
but you gotta ride on back.
I'll just go put some clothes on.
why don't you have any furniture?
you're not attached to her either?
but you were a little girl once.
there's no proof of that.
didn't dream of the big wedding?
dad walking you down the aisle?
didn't dream about who your bridesmaids would be?
didn't dream about the dress either.
Anna Turner, married last night in the hotel.
housekeeping found her like that.
someone took the time to cover her up after.
cared for her appearance.
the killer was probably someone she knew.
okay, there'll be a lot of out-of-town guests checked in, family and friends.
no one goes home until we say so.
cash wedding gifts.
at least, uh...
50 grand in here.
robbery gone wrong?
let's get this photographed and inventoried.
please, detective, I was hoping we could just split it up.
and the groom is where?
hasn't turned up yet.
but would you stick around if you did that?
well, doesn't look like he went far.
why, because he left his shoes here?
no.
because he left his wallet, watch, and keys here.
did you kill your bride, Jake?
okay, listen up.
we're looking for the groom, Jake Silvers.
floor by floor, you all know the drill.
let's go.
how'd you know there was something in that shoe?
could see one shoe was heavier than the other because it sat lower on the carpet.
Oh, you expect me to believe that?
I have no expectations as to what you will or will not believe.
and whatever you do believe can't change whatever's in that shoe.
why exactly can't you talk like a normal person?
when exactly was the last time you actually met a normal person?
she saved me.
Hey, maybe you should slow down a little with the tequila.
I got married last night.
did you know that?
Yeah, we heard about that.
is that Anna's blood?
you're cops.
how about you stand up for us right now, Jake? Okay?
I'm not a good person.
why'd you say that?
she thought I was.
I just wanted to be the person that Anna thought I was.
you're gonna put those on me now.
just for a little while.
this is Anna's blood.
I have to go see Anna.
we'll take you to her.
no-- no, you won't!
don't shoot!
don't you shoot.
well, get him outta there.
crews, come on.
crews, come on.
come on, crews.
let's go.
detective Carl Ames lead detective Crews murder case
you were the lead detective on the Charlie Crews murder case?
Yeah, I worked that case.
took my 20 right after we closed it.
and no dna's gonna tell me we got the wrong guy.
here's what's left of Tom Seybolt.
boyhood friend and part owner in a bar with Crews.
but Tom was skimming so crews goes to settle the books and kills Tom.
here's Tom's pretty wife.
dead couple had two kids.
used to call Crews "Uncle Charlie."
you lost these.
stun baton?
900, 000 volts.
felt like more.
Where's Jake?
I hope you die, you son of a bitch!
they should've shot you for what you did to my Anna!
parents of the bride? - Yeah.
don't you just love weddings?
we have hair and blood here.
blunt force trauma back here.
somebody pushed her hard up against the wall.
somebody strong.
Yeah, or someone very angry.
I just needed to get this bag in-- please, I
Hey, that's okay, officer. I got this.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm sorry about that.
I'm detective Crews.
you're?
I was one of Anna's bridesmaids.
you look a lot younger than Anna.
can I ask how you knew her?
Jake and my brother are friends.
but Anna was always so nice to me.
she treated me...
so nice.
um, the disposable cameras.
Anna said it was my job to collect them.
I thought maybe someone would want them.
of course.
but you didn't have to bring them up here.
someone would've come for them.
I wanted...
what is it, Tiffie?
she said she had a brother.
maybe you can call him.
you okay?
she's not used to drinking like this.
I told her have a beer.
steady her out, you know?
but she wodn't listen to me.
Anna's dead.
I loved her.
I know. I know. Come on.
I got your blood alcohol level test here, Jake.
I don't think I've ever seen a number this high.
what name will they put on her tombstone?
did she take your last name?
Yeah.
she couldn't wait to be Anna Silvers.
is that what they'll put on her tombstone?
I'm sure they will.
if she took your name, that was her name too.
what happened after you got back to the suite?
I passed out.
and when you woke up
go ahead, Jake.
what happened when you woke up?
Anna was on the floor.
there was...Blood everywhere.
her dress was in the corner.
she was dead.
so you covered her up?
Yeah.
that's right.
because you didn't want her laying there like that.
why would someone kill her?
you need to know who killed her.
no matter who it is.
is it possible that you did something and you don't remember it?
no. - No?
you had a lot to drink, Jake.
I saw you assault my partner.
you get violent. - I didn't
you get violent when you get drunk. - No, I didn't!
you've had a problem with violence in the past, haven't you, Jake?
but that was before.
it was before Anna.
she saved me.
if you loved Anna, you need to know who did it, Jake, no matter who that person is.
for her!
I couldn't.
I couldn't.
could I? I mean...
could I have?
detectives, I am Jake's attorney.
Jake, I need you to stop talking.
he doesn't have to talk.
we have Anna's blood all over him.
we have his assault of a police officer.
that would be me.
I saw you at the hotel, didn't I?
Yeah, that's right.
I was at the wedding, the wedding party.
but in this room, I am Jake's attorney.
well, counselor...
we have his admission of blacking out during the time of Anna's death.
he doesn't have to talk unless he's interested in avoiding the needle.
both the tractor and the bentley are registered to a Charlie Crews.
Yes, yes, yes-- that is correct.
but you were driving the tractor?
Yes, but both vehicles are insured by your company, so I need you
I have to get a supervisor.
no, no-- I don't need a supervisor.
I need you to -
Hi.
hello.
can I, uh, help you?
Yes, I'm looking for Charlie Crews.
Oh, well he's not here right now, so...
Oh, what a shame.
you must be that Mr. Earley Charlie met in prison.
is it true you live in his garage?
well, in a room above his garage actually, yeah.
you look younger in person.
I've seen you in the papers.
those pictures they use aren't very flattering.
no, no...They're...they're not.
they make you look grumpy.
you don't seem grumpy.
who'd you say you were again?
I didn't, I'm sorry.
I'm Olivia.
and are you a friend of Charlie's?
not exactly.
but I hope to be.
I hope to be your friend too, Ted.
husband's got her blood on his hands.
he can't account for where he was during the murder.
he's got those assault charges in his jacket.
let's get what we need to make it stick.
that's an interesting fruit.
thank you.
it's a horned melon.
also known as a jelly melon, a kiwano, or the African horned cumber.
african horned cucumber?
Yeah, it's an ornamental fruit, but you can still eat it if you want to.
I thought there'd be more.
more to what?
in the pool...with Jake.
you know when you put those volts in the water?
I was almost dead.
Yeah, I remember that.
it was a near-death experience.
and it not being a full-death experience should make you happy.
nothing happened.
there were no lights.
no tunnel.
no dead relatives.
maybe I wasn't near death enough for it to be a near-death experience.
detectives, where are we with the Anna Turner killing?
Jake silvers-- - Jake didn't do it.
there's no way he killed his wife.
um, that's very funny you say jake didn't do it, because your partner here says the opposite.
and when I say "that's funny," detective, of course I mean that's not funny.
I know, but look-- over the last 12 years,
I've known more than a few men who've killed their wives.
and I looked into Jakes' eyes, and I just didn't see it there.
you looked into his eyes?
they are the windows to the soul.
that's very profound, but the lapd believes Jake Silvers is a lead suspect, and because we believe this, the city of los angeles requires you to get him for anna turner's murder.
what?
she was married.
she took his name.
she died Anna Silvers.
I'm sorry.
I sure do not envy you.
Yeah, why is that?
woman boss, woman partner -
makes my head spin at thinking about what a hen house this department has become.
not like it used to be, huh?
hey Charlie, you remember my wife?
sure I do.
she's all over me to ask you to come out the house this weekend.
having a little backyard barbeque, family, friends
say yes, Charlie. Don't make me go back to leslie with a no.
I need to know if this is gonna be a thing with you.
which "this" is that?
this thing with Jake Silvers.
are you gonna go see falsely accused people everywhere?
you think that's not a good instinct for a cop to have?
I just need to know if it's gonna be a thing with you.
shouldn't innocent until proven guilty be a thing with all of us?
were Jake and Anna having problems?
Jake loved Anna.
loved her!
would never hurt her. ever.
loved her.
when Jake met Anna, the guy was totally lost.
you mean his prior assault charges.
Yeah.
you're pretty.
shut up, Mason! she's a cop.
a pretty, pretty cop.
and you, that dude-- dude, you are so torn from the headlines!
Thanks, dude.
so you used to date Anna.
a few times. - once.
you know, just hook ups. nothing serious.
not like Jake.
and what about Eddie?
did Eddie ever "hook up" with Anna?
that would be a no.
I don't think Eddie plays for our team.
our team? I don't think Eddie plays for any team.
Eddie loves the law.
there he is.
yo, eddie!
what are you-- what are you doing?
ease up, eddie.
why don't you grab yourself something?
take the edge off.
you're drunk.
Anna is dead, and Jake is in jail for it.
and the only thing you two can do is just sit there and drink.
it's a...Wake?
Anna loved Jake.
you can't believe how.
why don'you tell me how?
Anna had a tough time growing up.
Anna used to...Act out.
I mean, we all did stuff, but Anna always had to go further-- drink more.
was she involved with drugs?
it's okay. You can tell us.
we're investigating the murder.
was she involved with drugs?
she always had to do more drugs.
more guys, more everything.
it was more than partying, what she used to do.
like, I don't know.
punishment.
Yeah...Punishment...
until she met Jake.
they were a team.
and you used to date Jake.
on and off. - at parties sometimes.
just hook ups?
can I ask you something?
about Anna?
no, about Jake.
if he doesn't remember what he did -
what he did to Anna, is it as bad as if he did remember it?
you mean legally?
Tiffany, if Jake killed Anna, he's going to prison for a very long time if he remembers it or not.
how's your partner doing?
I'm not a rat, lieutenant.
I'm not asking you to be one, detective.
it'd be better for your partner if he was removed from duty.
the lapd is not...
the best environment for him to be in.
the best environment?
you can do this, Dani.
you can do something good for Crews, for the department, and good for yourself.
so if it's bad for the department, is it bad for me too, lieutenant?
where are you right now?
Dani, this is not an excuse to backslide.
do you understand me?
I'm actually going in to a meeting right now.
buy me a drink.
do I know you?
does it matter?
detective Carl Ames lead detective Crews murder case
Mr. Andrews, my realtor called about me stopping by to look at the house.
there was no forced entry.
they just let Crews walk right in.
you mean the killer?
it wasn't Crews.
crews was exonerated.
sure, if you like.
the killer.
you have a beautiful home.
thank you.
husband's body was found in the living room.
throat was slit.
would you like some tea, Mr. Burke?
no, no thank you.
never thought about selling, but then your realtor called and said someone wanted to look, so...
as to the wife, the killer got her on the staircase.
as you can see, she was headed back up to protect her son I would think.
and the son-- he never made it out of his room.
or he ran back in there to hide.
hard to tell.
and the daughter?
daughter was nine years old.
well, she was out of the house.
I guess you could call her lucky.
but with this being her family,
I'm not sure the word lucky correctly applies.
her bed is unmade.
she was here.
if her bed was unmade, then she was here.
not at a sleepover.
they made their beds every day.
they had to make their beds every day.
she was here that night.
Mr. Crews.
it is Crews, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
I'll go.
why come to this place, Mr. Crews?
haven't they punished you enough for what you didn't do?
there were reports you had a problem with drinking at the end.
you go to hell.
I count four blenders.
why do people always give blenders as wedding gifts?
maybe I'll get my dad a blender.
he's getting married.
re-married.
maybe I'll get him a blender.
and I can write on the card,"congratulations, dad."
I hope you really enjoy your new blender.
you're doing that thing again where you're not really talking to me.
I begged her not to marry him.
he was arrested before-- you know that.
on assault charges.
Yes, we are aware of that.
I told my Anna that Jake was trouble.
his whole family's trouble.
all of his friends-- all they do is drink and make trouble.
Jake's lawyer Eddie seems to have turned out okay.
Eddie is Anna's friend, detective.
not Jake's.
he hardly knows Jake.
I always thought that Eddie and Anna might end up together.
why is that?
Eddie was so in love with her.
he was always at the house.
he was there for her.
he was nice.
lobby apple.
what?
there was a big bowl of them by the front desk.
the hotel wants you to take 'em.
we can hear you in there.
uh, I was in the shower.
your hair's not wet.
I was about to get in.
why would you say that you were taking a shower when you weren't?
you know, you didn't mention that you were Anna's friend and not Jake's.
I am under no obligation as an attorney to mention who my acquaintances are.
but you were Anna's friend.
so why would a friend of the victim represent the accused?
that's very, uh...
what's the word, Crews?
enlightened.
we were friends, okay?
all of us.
everyone hooking up with everyone.
Yeah, that is right.
Hmm...Bad bed for such a nice hotel.
you ought to complain about it, Eddie.
look, I would like you to leave now.
everyone hooking up with everyone else, but not you.
I would like both of you out of my room!
leave now!
look...
I tried to throw it away, but I couldn't.
I just couldn't let her go.
Anna porn?
Yeah, I know that looks bad.
no.
it doesn't look bad.
it looks weird, Eddie.
ve, very weird.
this is porn, Eddie, onto which you have pasted the dead woman's face.
this is a product of an illegal search.
this is a centerfold from ten years ago, Eddie.
you been going at this a real long time.
there's a word for that kind of thing.
Yeah, how's the jury gonna take that, Eddie?
you must've loved anna a lot.
I did love her.
but I didn't...Kill her.
Jake did.
I loved Anna.
a true, true love.
and... I have an alibi.
that's him.
you sure?
he paid me two grand, made me wear a blonde wig, a wedding dress, and called me Anna.
Yeah, I think I'd remember him.
Constance Griffiths attorney for Charlie Crews
how long was detective Crews in prison before I took his case?
nearly eight years.
and what was his emotional state wh you first met him?
you'd have to ask him that.
hypothetically then.
can you speak about the emotional state of an innocent man who's been in prison for that long?
hypothetically?
he gives up.
gives up on what?
he gives up on life.
Hey, aren't you that guy?
I might be that guy.
you are that guy.
I'm Tina.
and I'm Gina.
Tina and Gina. really?
really.
Hey, they gave you all that money-- like, what?
$50 million.
the amount was not disclothed.
disclosed?
Yeah, that's what she said.
all that money.
why are you riding the bus?
what kind of a person lives in L. A. and doesn't have his own car?
a crazy person.
maybe this isn't such a good idea.
Oh no, no, no-- it--it'll be fine, Olivia.

we have a warm pool, don't we, Ted?
I don't know. I guess we keep it about 81-82.

my parents don't want my sister to miss any more classes.
hey Tiffie, can I see your eyes?
I have a bad headache.
I'd rather just keep these on if that's okay.
I want to apologize to you, Tiffie.
why would you want to do that?
because you asked us for our help, and we didn't listen to you.
I didn't ask for your help.
you asked us to help you help jake.
when you brought us those cameras you asked, but I wasn't listening.
what is he talking about?
no, I can't help anybody.
think how you would feel if Jake went to prison for a crime he didn't commit.
Anna loved Jake.
don't you think she'd want you to save Jake?
how... How can I save Jake?
you're the only one who can.
you have the answer.
and you've had it all along, haven't you?
Tiffany, detective Crews is gonna show you some photos.
we want you to look at them very closely. Okay?
maybe you can tell my sister what she should be looking for.
you see it, don't you, Tiffie?
what is she supposed to see?
they're just stupid wedding pictures.
let me see those. - no-- you're fine.
see in the background there?
and there by the D. J. and in this one by the wall.
what are you doing in these pictures, Tiffany?
I'm taking pictures.
in these pictures, I see you taking pictures.
but I went through all the pictures, and I couldn't find any of the pictures I see you taking.
where are those pictures, Tiffany?
what is that, some kind of riddle?
what kind of cop are you?
you brought us the cameras, but did you bring us all of the cameras?
did you hold on to one?
did you hold on to your camera?
because you took a picture of something?
something you shouldn't have?
where is the camera, Tiffany?
he smashed it.
let me see your eyes, Tiffie.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
uh, this should not take long.
are we going to find out who did it?
okay.
I was drinking.
I shouldn't have been.
but I felt so grown up.
where were you?
Anna's room.
it was me, Jake, and Anna.
I was drinking and then I didn't feel so well, so I went to the bathroom.
I woke up on the bathroom floor...
and I heard voices.
two voices.
and my brother, Bradley.
you better shut your mouth!
that's one, Bradley.
one what?
you heard voices...
they were in the living room arguing-- Anna and Bradley.
Bradley was drunk.
real drunk like he gets.
mean like he gets.
don't say one more word!
that's two, Bradley. You don't want it to get to three, understand?
it was crazy.
Anna was naked.
she must've gotten woken up or something.
Bradley was trying to steal that money.
that stupid purse full of money!
and she caught him.
he was so drunk.
and then what happened?
Anna told him he was nothing.
her voice was so soft that I thought everything was gonna be okay.
but it wasn't okay.
it happened so fast.
Bradley grabbed her by the neck.
he pushed her against the wall so hard.
I didn't know what to do.
I looked down, and I had the camera in my hand.
I took the picture...
of him standing over her.
I saw it.
that was three, Bradley.
didn't I tell you you didn't want to get to three?
he smashed the camera.
he said I didn't see anything, but I did.
I saw what he did to Anna.
Anna would be happy I saved Jake.
chapter seven on vengeance.
revenge is a poison meant for others that we end up swallowing ourselves vengeance is a dark light that blinds all who seek it.
the untroubled soul knows there is no justice in revenge.
the untroubled soul knows that to seek vengeance is to seek destruction.
Where'd you get this?
Oh, you don't want to know.
serious cop with serious friends.
Ted, if you wanna walk away, I understand.
I wanna know where Rachel Seybolt is.
she's gone.
her family died and she got a new one.
and don't you dare try to find her.
please get out of my husband's car.
the fire sent me to get you.
to take you from here.
it's okay.
where was she treated?
any other injuries?
no sign of abuse.
it's just that she won't speak. It's not physical.
she can speak if she wanted to.
is there someone else besides yourself who knows her or whom she might open up and speak to?
Yeah. There is.
would you like us to contact them?
no, I'll take care of that.
see?
this is why gangs get themselves a bad reputation.
you piss them off, they tie you to a chair, and leave you in the bottom of a pool.
uh, I got a wallet here.
driver's license.
Max Horta. 36 years old.
you piss off a gang, Max?
you two go check out the victim.
go talk to his family.
Oh, you have alternate plans?
it's a gang. Round them all up, toss them in cells, see who squawks.
a gang?
no. Max kept to himself. Kept to our family.
gangs? Nunca.
he brought your daughter to work?
when it's not a school night, sometimes Max takes-- took Elsa to work with him.
they didn't come home for breakfast so we came down here.
Elsa was sitting there all alone.
no Max.
Elsa, can you tell us what happened last night?
he's dead.
you can't help him now. What difference does it make?
I'm gonna tell you a secret.
my partner over there never lets me drive the car.
never. Nunca.
can you tell me your secret, Elsa?
I sat here, doing my homework.
and what was your father doing?
he was over there. On the phone.
do you know who he was talking to?
no. He was very angry.
talking about some building.
when he hung up, he told me to wait here.
he told me not to move.
he never came back.
did your father say an address?
just a name.
the Bankley building?
that can't be true. That's not true. That is not true! That can't be true!
the Bankley building.
what were you doing here?
there was a party.
you sure the party was here?
what kind of party, Carla?
terrible party.
who threw the party, Carla?
I don't know, the people from the other side of town.
the "rich" side of town. I don't know them.
what happened here last night?
I think that there was something in my drink, cause I can't remember anything.
was it your first time at a party like this?
Yes.
no, there were others.
all in empty buildings?
how'd you know where the parties will be?
we get a text. Me and my friends.
we don't know from who, but we get a text.
and then we just-- just show up.
all your friends get this text?
no, just the pretty ones.
your father was beaten to death, badly.
neck snapped, ribs broken, joints shattered.
whoever is capable of doing this is an animal.
man, I heard he chews the bottle after he shoots it.
drinks blood to get like-- to look like he is, man. Boy's a monster.
something I can help you with?
funny you should say that.
Oh, man. This guy's a cop, man.
something I said?
how come when you want to get a kid to talk, you always make fun of me?
I do? Do I?
Yes. - Not always. Do I?
do you want to drive the car?
do you want me to drive the car?
no, I don't.
Hey, bro!
that's no fair, man. You weren't supposed to be in the cells.
not supposed to be in, yet just can't seem to stay out of them.
I got an expectation of privacy.
Hey, stop talking, man.
I got your personal effects here.
I heard he chews the bottle after he shoots it?
that's just exactly what I said.
Hey, he knows, man. You need to stop talking.
he chew this kind of bottle?
quality steroids?
it's not the kind of junk we usually find on you fellas.
you fellas? That's profiling right there, is what that is.
boy's a monster?
turns out, we're looking for a monster.
you help us find him, we'll help you with holding this.
help us with this?
you get caught with this, all you get is to testify in front of the U. S. Senate.
what he said. - Can we go?
Yeah, you can go down to processing.
should take a few days. System's real slow.
we'll talk again then.
what she said.
narcotics tracked the steroids to a flext gym, over in beverly hills.
is there a monster in beverly hills, Max?
you believe in monsters?
don't you?
Ah, detectives.
how can I help you?
are you the manager? - Owner.
Dr. Jackson Bridger.
this is ours. - Yours?
Yes, this is part of our flext steroid regimen.
your regimen?
you dispense steroids here?
I'm a board-certified physician, so I prescribe them.
our pharmacist dispenses them.
can I ask you where you got this?
off a couple of gang-bangers.
they probably don't work out here.
no, they probably don't.
any idea how they could have gotten a hold of this?
what happens to them after I prescribe them, I, uh, I really can't say.
my wife looks familiar to you, doesn't she?
Yeah, but I can't place her.
does this help? September, 1999?
no, I was away.
miss september, 1999.
likes hikes? Fresh-baked bread?
puppies?
since you dispense steroids to the members of the gym, it'd be a big help if we could take a look at your membership list.
sorry, no can do.
you see, the--the people training here pay a lot of money.
they have a certain, uh-- - expectation of privacy.
Yeah, yeah.
well, uh, we could come back with a warrant.
with that, I wish you the best of luck.
these folks are not members. They are my patients.
their records are covered by doctor-patient confidentiality.
Carla Horta goes to a bad party, someone calls her father.
father shows up, probably not very happy.
father gets extremely beaten to death.
couple of bangers talking about a guy capable of that, holding steroids traced back to here.
I do it because children seem to enjoy it.
when I make fun of you.
because they think you're uptight.
I am-- I am-- I am no uptight.
I'm not uptight. If you wanna drive the car, go ahead and drive.
take a look at that.
Bankley. Now there's a name we know.
his father brendan Bankley owns a bankley realty, which owns the Bankley building where the party took place.
what's the son of the building's owner doing going into the gym where the steroids came from?
don't know.
Benny does not look capable of breaking every bone in Max Horta's body.
you know, just because I don't say everything that pops into my head does not make me uptight.
I didn't say you're uptight.
I said kids think you're uptight.
though kids are tough to fool about that.
kids are notoriously tough to fool.
what did those bangers say again?
boy's a monster.
Marty hawkins, used to play high school ball with Benny.
Marty had a little more team spirit though.
he took a bat to the opposing team's pitcher, broke his leg.
he do time? - No.
released on condition he had counseling.
two more assault beefs knocked down the same way.
Oh, to grow up rich and connected.
you're rich, right, Crews? - Not from birth.
you're so rich, how come you don't have a car?
I gave it away.
Really? See, I heard that your "roommate" ran over it with a tractor.
that was the other one.
what exactly do they do to the not beautiful in that part of town?
Annabelle went to the same high school as our other two friends here.
but unlike them, she has a job.
and her parents?
mom is a pricey defense attorney.
dad died when she was a kid.
why aren't you bringing these kids in for questioning?
on what charge?
you guys don't plant evidence around here?
our gang of three is at a table set for four.
our gang doesn't have a leader.
what's up, big guy? What's up, man?
I'm guessing that's him.
same high school as the other three, but Patrick is just a little bit smarter.
his iq tested in the genius range.
does that really mean anything?
pretty sure it does.
child chess master, pitcher on the high school baseball team, thrown out of yale.
for?
apparently, just never going to class. Not even once.
and Patrick's father, jackson Bridger. Owner of flext.
where the steroids came from.
where the steroids came from.
anybody up there look familiar?
we talk, we walk?
he gave us them steroids. - What'd you give him?
phone numbers for hood girls.
just the pretty ones?
a couple of hood rats point their fingers at some beverly hills kid who's connected enough to walk away from three assault raps.
yo, maybe you all should plant something.
the oatmeal's $20. - I'm buying, have two.
Oh yeah, you're rich.
but I guess you worked for it.
did you just say something nice? To me no, I don't think so.
put that down.
they're not boys. They're dogs.
Patrick-- one in the middle-- alpha dog.
Marty, he's second. Beta dog.
Benny... omega dog. He's the fool.
hmm, that's what you see.
I see a group of spoiled rich kids.
and I want the big one in lock-up.
if that's what you want, that is what you shall have.
on what charge?
assaulting a police officer?
this one's got it's name written all over you.
can we help you?
see? Alpha dog. Beta dog, right?
you're the one with his nose always up alpha's ass?
man, you're a big one! 'Roids, right? Is it true what they say?
it makes some things big, but other things, you know, like, real small?
police! Down on the floor, now! Now!
can I help you?
I know you know who I am, so let's not pretend you don't. Okay?
you're jack Reese.
that's right.
and you're ex-parolee that lives with Crews.
I know Crews has that girl.
I need you to tell me what else he has.
why would I do that?
if you don't, I violate your parole.
you're not even a cop anymore.
you just keep saying that when you're back in the slam serving that last four years.
Jack Reese wasn't even a cop anymore.
do you like empty swimming pools, Marty?
or parties with pretty hood girls?
what about lethal injections? What's your take on that?
Patrick puts his finger to his lips and you obey, that how it works?
woof.
detective.
I have young Marty's attorney here, Annabelle shore.
we know a girl with that name, don't we, Marty?
I'm her mother.
do you all know each other?
what I know is that Marty's been released.
unshackle him, please.
he assaulted a police officer.
I have witnesses who will testify detective Crews incited Marty to those actions.
okay, before he goes, do you think Marty could tell us where he was when Max Horta found himself dead at the bottom of this pool?
go ahead, Marty. You can tell them.
I was at my therapist's.
at your therapist's all night?
I get bad nights. Terrors. Can't sleep.
always have, ever since I was little.
when I have really bad nights, sometimes I stay at dr. James' house.
that's where I was.
I will tell you that Marty was at my house all night that night.
but, really, that's all I will tell you.
doctor-patient confidentiality.
Yeah, there's a lot of that going around.
is it normal for doctors to allow patients to stay at their house?
each patient is an individual, so the word "normal" does not apply.
if I were your patient, could I stay over?
sometimes I have bad nights.
did I say that out loud? - Crews.
my partner thinks I say everything that pops into my head.
is that normal?
I think you should leave now.
right, because there is no such thing as normal.
which is a relief, because sometimes I don't feel normal.
is it normal not to feel normal?
I'm sure some people find you charming, detective.
I don't.
how much do you charge an hour, doc?
$450 an hour?
for a 50-minute hour, yes.
how can it be an hour if it's 50 minutes? That's messing with time.
I do say everything that pops into my head.
maybe I should come back.
if I wanted to make an appointment, who should I call?
you should call another doctor.
rich parents, high-priced lawyers, shrink's at $450 an hour.
then you know what happens.
it's the chief on the phone, your name in the paper, and you wishing it was a gang killing.
you go after a gang and miss, maybe they shoot you, maybe you get them next time.
you go after one of these princes and miss, you're doing traffic in time square.
so what am I saying to you, detectives?
you're saying don't miss.
let's go talk to the alpha dog.
un hotel.
hotel gentil.
un hotel.
hotel gentil.
I'm not talking to you.
you just did.
hotel gentil. Un hotel. hotel gentil.
Hey, Benny. Remember me?
Patrick tell you not to talk to us?
well, it's Patrick I want to talk to.
learning french?
I want to live in paris some day.
with Patrick?
Patrick? In paris? No, never.
why not?
Patrick, he's L. A.
you've seen him. You understand what I mean.
do you know where he is now?
charging. - Charging?
he says he needs it.
and where does he charge?
out there on his bike.
says he needs to feel the city.
and you believe that?
that he just drives around L. A.On his bike?
why would he lie? Besides you can see it when he comes back too.
so alive. Lit up. It's like I said.
Patrick is L. A. You know?
it's like if he weren't here then-- L. A.wouldn't be here either.
is that why you want to go to paris?
because it's not Patrick?
I'd like you to look at something.
that's Max Horta.
he left behind a wife and two daughters.
Max Horta? He's L. A.Too, Annabelle.
trace came back on that call Max got that sent him to that party.
it came from his daughter, Carla.
Carla, do you recognize any of these people?
I don't remember. I don't remember them.
I don't remember calling my papa.
my god. Oh, my god. Did I call him?
did I call him, and then he came, and then they
can I ask you about the girl, Rachel Seybolt?
both you and charlie were close friends with the murdered family?
they were our dear friends, yes.
and you were close with the daughter Rachel?
Yes.
Hey, Rachel.
there's someone here to see you.
Rachel, honey. You remember me?
I remember you, Rachel.
you used to brush my hair. You remember that?
I had those gold shoes.
the party shoes, you used to call them.
it's okay.
we're just gonna sit with you for a while then.
open the door. Open the door.
back door. - Got it. Right.
I remember this.
Oh, god. Oh, I remember that.
I can't. I can't, charlie.
it's-- no, it's--it's his. It's my husband's car.
I really gotta get a car.
you and your partner looking for me?
I've been watching you train. Pretty intense.
ex-addict work out, right?
lots of anger. Anger's good.
why don't you come down to the station? We can talk about it.
why don't you come on a ride with me on my bike?
and we won't have to talk.
do you really like talk?
where would we go?
out there.
what's out there, Patrick?
everything. All the time.
I'd really like for you to come down to the station with me.
no.
that's not what you'd like.
he came to your gym?
I called. You didn't pick up.
must have been in a canyon.
everything, all the time." That's what he said.
that's what these kids think they can have.
everything, all the time.
everyone works for them. Even us.
even the shrink.
Dr. Lana James.
she works for them. She's not one of them.
what?
worm.
didn't I tell you organic fruit would kill you? Didn't I?
worms are just protein, right?
Oh, please don't do that. Why would you do that? What's wrong with you?
Dr. James? Come with me, please.
one of my patients was arrested?
that seems to be the case.
do you know which one?
I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't.
I was told one of my patients was arrested and was asking for me.
I'd like to know who it is.
I'm just the new captain around here, ma'am.
they don't like to tell me much.
but one of the detectives will certainly know more. Please.
that's a crime board.
we use it to see the connections between the suspects and the victims.
the victim's the dead man there.
see, there's the kind of contections those kids have that get you floor seats to laker games.
Mm-hmm, and there's the kind of connections that we have that get you life in prison.
I'm on here. Why? Why would i be on there?
Oh, come on, you're smart, doc. You can see why.
Marty's connected to the dead man.
you're connected to Marty.
when Marty goes down for Max Horta's murder, so do you.
are you ready for that, doc? Life in prison?
you really think when it comes down to it, they're gonna be there for you?
you're the help. Just like us.
I'm on here.
Marty wasn't with me that night.
I don't know where he was.
he wasn't with me.
Patrick asked me to lie.
why would you do that?
you wouldn't understand.
now what happens?
now you get Patrick to say it.
I think we should go in.
just a-- just a quick look. To supervise. Come on.
at least turn the cameras on.
get a sketch artist up here?
you don't think very much of me, do you, detective?
no, ma'am. I sure don't.
but, like you said, I wouldn't understand.
I'm done. You can get dressed.
no smile tonight, dr. James?
okay.
in fact, it's better.
we need to talk, Patrick.
we need to talk.
is that that "professional" voice you use when you're in session with Annabelle?
I didn't know she saw Annabelle too.
no, this is serious. - Okay.
I'll make you a deal.
you climb on for a little ride...and then we'll talk.
how little? - I won't even turn the key.
the police came to question me.
no, use the professional voice.
how do you talk to Annabelle?
you need to listen to me, Patrick.
the police came to question me about Marty.
I don't think they believe me.
I believe you. I do.
I think that you are a very believable woman.
Patrick, you need to take this seriously.
remember the last time we were here?
you liked the way I made you feel?
tell me.
tell me.
I liked the way you made me feel.
Oh, that's pretty good. He just discredited her as a witness.
a shrink who's been having sex with her patient's boyfriend.
how's that gonna play out in front of a jury?
everything, all the time.
no, no, no. Not yet. don't get off yet.
Hey, Crews, Reese, I know you're out there.
you having fun? You like to watch? Watch this.
I'd like to have heard what he just said to her.
how did she hear what he said? - How did she hear?
he was practically on top of her.
no, not her down there.
how did Max's daughter Elsa hear?
how did she hear what her father said?
it would have been... too loud!
you lied to us, didn't you, Elsa?
you didn't hear your father on the phone that night, did you?
you couldn't have.
it was too loud.
did you stay here when he left you?
you didn't stay, did you?
did your father get mad when you disobeyed him?
yeah? My father too.
he would get so mad when I wouldn't listen to him.
but you wanted to make your father happy, didn't you?
me too. I wanted to make my father happy, because he loved me.
like your father loved you.
did you leave here, Elsa?
I followed my father.
and you saw something bad?
what did you see, Elsa?
my father, outside that building.
did you see anybody else?
a very big man.
what did the big man do?
he hit my father over and over.
my father was screaming.
but he kept hitting him.
then my father stopped screaming.
Elsa, the big man, did you see his face?
that's him! That's the one.
I didn't do what my father asked of me.
now he's dead.
what kind of monster makes my daughters think they killed their own father?
you tell me what kind.
he's not a monster. He's a punk.
Dr. James?
he's in there. Something's wrong. He's--he's not Marty anymore.
he came here and I could see it right away.
I could tell Marty was gone.
don't you guys have bigger guns?
Reese, pop the clip! - I got it!
you were supposed to help us.
he's dead.
you were supposed to help us?
you were seeing all of them, weren't you?
even Patrick.
you'll never get Patrick.
massive steroid overdose.
someone pumped a solution into him with 20 times the potency of an average dose.
mm, steroid hotshot.
Marty was a loose end. Patrick was cleaning up the mess.
should I release the body?
can you hold off on that?
your buddy Patrick put Marty on the slab there, Benny.
no, that's a lie. We're friends. We've al--always been friends.
maybe you should tell Marty here that Patrick's his friend.
but Marty can't hear you,'cause he's a little dead right now.
you can look all you want to, Benny. He's not gonna get any less dead.
if we just do what Patrick tells us to do, then it will all be okay.
it's not okay.
Benny, did you not do what Patrick told you to do?
is that why it's not okay?
what happened at that party?
what did Patrick tell you to do?
he told me to go with that girl.
he told you to go where with her?
into her room.
Patrick opened the door.
there she is on the floor, out of it.
what did he want you to do?
he told me that I could do what I want with her.
Patrick had gotten me girls before, but they were pros.
but that girl Carla, she was real.
so you called her father.
after Patrick closed the door, I took her cell phone,
I speed-dialed the number that said "dad," and then I told the dude that answered that his daughter was in trouble. To come and get her.
then I left the room.
and I got so drunk I couldn't think.
and what happened to Max Horta?
I guess Marty took care of him.
and Patrick took care of Marty.
you guess? - I'm the clown.
I make Patrick laugh, but he doesn't tell me anything.
he knows I'm soft.
he knows not to trust me.
who does he trust?
he trust Annabelle not to lie to him?
she'd never lie to anybody.
that's why Patrick loves her. That's why we all love her.
but she's gone.
I can't find her anywhere.
I can't find Annabelle.
did Patrick kill her too?
is there a problem?
the best thing about paris: It's not L. A. Right, Annabelle?
if L. A.Is Patrick, then getting away from L. A.Is getting away from him.
I didn't think you'd be cruel.
he is. Believe me.
Patrick told me about you.
he admires you.
admires how you didn't lay down.
how you took it and made a new life for yourself.
I'm gonna make a new life for myself.
unless I'm under arrest.
we have nothing to hold you on.
no, you can go. Send me a postcard.
just before you do go, I want you to meet some people.
Annabelle, this is Carla and Elsa Horta.
girls, this is Annabelle.
where are you, Annabelle?
at my house. Marty was just here.
did you hear what I just said, Patrick?
you said Marty was just there.
it was bad, Patrick. He's all messed up. He said that you tried to kill him.
Annabelle, what are you doing?
Marty said that you tried to kill him.
he said that you gave him some bad juice.
he's looking for you, Patrick. What's going on?
Annabelle, stay right there. Hold on. Hello?
Patrick, what's going on?
what do you mean, Benny?
with Marty. Haven't you heard? He was arrested. The cops have him.
I'm out of here, man. I'm going south.
wet your bed until you were seven years old?
is that-- that's late, right?
Where'd you get that?
also says here that you often feel like a fraud.
you told your therapist you wanted to be more like Benny?
how'd you get that?
because people know who Benny is, but no one knows who I am.
how'd you get that?
your shrink gave it to me.
when she found out you tried to kill Marty, she gave us this.
that's a lie. You are lying to me.
Marty says you killed Max Horta.
you do that, Patrick?
no, he did that!
and then he comes crying to me about it!
what am I going to do, Patrick? Help me, Patrick. I lost my temper, Patrick.
crying like a little baby.
Marty says you tried to kill him too.
a hotshot of steroids?
Yeah, I jacked him up.
but guess what? It didn't kill him.
yeah? But guess what? It did.
they think it's their city.
it's not. It's our city.
this car's just an object. Objects have no meaning.
they don't. They don't.
you're a nut job. You know that, Crews?
what's with that car? - It's just an object.
doesn't have any meaning.
even if it did, it'd be in italian.
so I wouldn't understand it anyway.
you gonna write me a ticket?
like that bond trader who's puttin' it to your ex?
I know hollis worked for you, jack.
even if that were true, the proof would be in my lapd file, which I heard has gone missing.
Yeah, I heard that.
okay. You drive carefully now.
Oh, don't talk to ted anymore.
you make him nervous for some reason.
this is Reese.
Yeah, I have the interview with the dean from the business school.
it's for a teaching position.
you asked my husband permission to have sex with me?
he punched me, then you slapped me.
maybe we're even?
it's just that she won't speak.
it's not physical--she could speak if she wanTed to.
there was six. There is five.
there are five officers in this photo, Ted.
there could just as easily be four. - Be four.
that's a threat, Charlie.
against Jack Reese.
who are you afraid of, Jack?
there was six. There is five.
there could just as easily be four.
there was six. There is five.
there could just as easily be four.
went through the academy with Jack Reese.
committed suicide 1988.
that's what the newspaper said.
you don't believe them?
newspaper said I was guilty.
yeah... said I was guilty too.
Ted, you were guilty.
I know, but it still hurt to see it there like that in print.
where you gonna start?
with the woman.
thanks for seeing me, Mrs. Dunn.
of course.
you said you were looking into Jimmy's death?
the police report said his gun discharged when he was cleaning it?
well, that was because of the pension.
if it had said the other, there would have been no pension.
I understand.
but everybody knew what it meant.
at the funeral...
all the cops knew.
the force went over this years ago.
why come around and ask this now?
do you remember these men?
no, I don't.
I'm afraid I don't remember much about that day.
maybe I can help you.
that man there, his name is Jack Reese.
no.
that wedding ring you wear...
it's the one Jimmy gave me.
Oh, it's not real.
it's wax. It's not real.
lots of feeling here.
all these cars were once brand new.
a lot of these cars were someone's very first car.
remember your first car?
Yeah, it cost $300 and smelled of cat piss.
did you have a cat? - No.
I remember my first car. God, I loved that car.
maybe a little too much.
that's a really flat car.
what do we got?
is that a...
Yeah.
what about that stuff up there?
I think that's him too.
and that stuff up there?
him too.
gonna open it up now.
if he was lucky, he was dead when he went in there.
Yeah, if he was lucky.
you knew the victim? Mike?
he's, uh, one of our drivers.
college kid. He lucked into a union card.
what was he doing in there?
we're curious about that ourselves.
Hey, I stopped the crusher as soon as I saw what was in there.
I called the cops.
look, I just take the cars off the line and I crush 'em up.
who puts the cars in the line?
I do.
and you are?
I'm Rob Dow. I'm the dispatcher here.
I put that car in line.
you check if the cars are empty?
Yeah, when they come in.
all right, we're gonna need statements from all of you.
and I'm gonna need an address for Mike Brody. Can you get me that?
sure. I think he just moved in with his girlfriend, Rosa.
yes?
ma'am, do you know a Mike Brody?
why, has something happened?
may we come in?
ma'am. - I don't wanna hear it.
I don't wanna hear what you have to say.
ma'am, this is happening.
it's happening whether you close this door on us or not.
you had just moved in together?
a few months ago.
Mike and I were engaged.
was he having trouble with anyone?
you think someone murdered Mike?
we're looking into everything.
what about the people at work?
no. Everyone liked him.
Rosa? What is it?
probably nothing.
probably nothing, but, well, tell us anyway.
just to be sure.
in this last month, at night, when Mike thought I was asleep, he'd go to the garage, lock the door.
almost every night.
