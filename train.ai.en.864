but we'd be idiots not to listen to him.
you're in charge, he sits in on all the differentials.
until you get your license back, this is all unofficial.
no procedures, no patient contact.
think I can probably deal with that last one.
the only reason I let you go is because our relationship wouldn't work if I was in charge.
but I won't be in charge soon, so...
I came to offer you your old job back.
I know.
I look bad.
but circumstances have changed.
I don't want the job.
why not?
because there's a much simpler explanation for you firing me.
you wanted to break up with me, but you were too weak to do it yourself.
then why would I try to hire you back?
can we please get some dinner tonight?
I'm sorry.
you're a follow-up?
you must not treat him.
Dibala killed my wife.
she was a trade unionist.
he took her from our home while I was at work.
who took her?
Dibala's youth labor league.
he pretends it's to get young people off the street.
but he takes teenage boys from the provinces and feeds them drugs and alcohol and teaches them how to torture.
they dumped her body in my yard two weeks later.
they raped her.
they carved inyenzi, cockroach, onto her stomach because she's Sitibi.
I'm very sorry, but I can't discuss other patients.
you should talk to a lawyer, talk to the U. N...
so they can sit and watch, like they did in Rwanda?
there are 2 million sitibi.
he's planning to massacre them all.
his radio stations are talking about a final war to exterminate the cockroaches.
he can't recover.
I'm sorry.
how was your first day of school?
didn't pee once in the sandbox.
how was it with cuddy?
what did you think I was talking about?
you didn't use garlic.
you didn't use it last night either.
we always use garlic on chicken florentine.
it tastes fine this way.
you seem to be losing your sense of smell.
I think you're losing your sense of mind.
I can check right now if you pull my finger.
no, it's the
are you inventing some big medical mystery here?
because if you're imagining things again...
you weren't wearing shoes last night either.
Yes,shoes,garlic-- I am vampire, Sookie.
I told you to get that echo fixed.
my downstairs neighbor, after you moved in, started complaining about the extra noise and the cooking smells.
what's his name?
I don't want you making things worse.
he's on the condo board, and I'm trying to get the back garden renovated.
the white coats taught me a whole bunch of fun coping and relating skills.
he's not only a total jerk, he's a decorated war hero who lost an arm in vietnam.
I mean, there's no winning with this guy.
coping skill number one...
complete avoidance.
you happy?
booty call?
give me 20 minutes to not shower.
patient's having a heart attack.
mask at 15 liters.
just thought you'd like to know.
lassa fever.
you were mad that I withheld it last time, so I'm saying it right up front.
he's already stabilized, so 40 ccs of ribavirin, and we're home in time for Ellen.
I checked.
there's no lassa in Dibala's country.
the rash is gone.
it rules out your dioxin theory.
he's running a slight fever, which we can add to the heart, plus the lung ulcers.
Ebola? Marburg?
too long an incubation period. -Yes?
don't people sometimes travel?
to places that have, you know, a fever that originated in the Nigerian town of lassa?
he's been to three other countries in the last two years:
here, Zimbabwe, and Sharm El-sheikh, Egypt.
no lassa there either.
again.
Trypanosomiasis?
no sleep disturbances.
but fits best with the symptoms.
and it's geographicall the most-- what?
the Egypt visit was for the African Union meeting, where I'm guessing he was meeting people from Africa.
which includes Liberia, which sent some members of their foreign ministry, which has itself just been hit by an outbreak of jock itch.
no, wait.
not jock itch.
lassa fever.
I'll start the ribavirin.
I did say it up front.
it's great to have the old team back together again, huh?
yesterday, it's poisoning.
today, lassa fever.
maybe a specialist-- joseph!
leave him alone.
these people know what they are doing.
are you married, doctor?
no.
you have a girlfriend.
Yes.
judging by your tentative answer and the complicated expression on her face,
I believe that is she, standing in the hallway.
I got a call from Douglas' department at Princeton General.
they want me to interview with them.
which is weird, because when I called last week, they said they had nothing available.
so I never sent in my resume.
Douglas owes me a favor.
most people send chocklates.
I'd stand outside your apartment all night holding up a boom box, except you told me you hate '80s music.
so about dinner?
I'm free tomorrow night.
I was wondering what that noise was.
it's the damn cane.
and I'm Greg.
and I can't sleep with you banging around with that thing.
you're not actually saying that I have too loud a cane?
is that hard for you to understand?
only in the sense that it has a rubber tip on the end and not a tap shoe.
now you're getting cute with me.
okay, we started badly.
I apologize for the noise, and we will try to figure out a way to be quieter - -
and a thousand other things I don't give a crap about.
now you keep it down, or we're gonna have trouble.
you paged me?
this is Ama.
she is from our country, but she lives here now.
we'd like you to use her blood.
for what?
she recovered from lassa fever two years ago.
our health minister has advised us that plasma from one who has the antibodies is much more effective than ribavirin.
this is a signed consent form.
will you take her blood, please?
no.
I want to do this.
you understand that we would be using your blood to cure president Dibala.
I know.
are you from the Sitibi people?
I am Sitibi.
did they threaten you in some way?
your family members back home?
please let me give the blood.
please.
do it.
she's being coerced.
if she is, I'd rather have a needle prick on my conscience than the death of her family members.
don't let him in there!
that's enough! We got him.
you all right?
who is that man?
he shot him?
no.
you need a lawyer.
you can get a court-appointed.
they can help you.
I can't be helped.
you did a stupid, terrible thing.
but given the circumstances with your wife, you could get a reduced sentence.
she wasn't my wife.
then who was she?
they never told us her name.
what his men made us do to that woman...
he is now going to do to all the Sitibi.
you could have gotten killed.
he wasn't going to hurt me.
he fired a gun in the hospital.
come here.
maybe next time don't yell out that warning.
the bloody eye was from an enlarged lymph node blocking the retinal vein.
we restored circulation, but it means we've got to add lymph involvement to the heart, lungs, and rising fever.
I'm just gonna sit here quietly.
Why?
I feel like I've been inadvertently undermining your authority, so I'm just gonna observe.
not gonna say a word.
the heart could point to sarcoidosis.
I'm thinking the x-rays indicate a lack of hilar adenopathy, which rules it out.
staph aureus?
no.
because...
he...
smokes?
he's miming a thermometer.
he says the fever's not high enough.
so some other infection.
he's wrong.
the fever could be misleading us into thinking infection.
talk.
it could all fit with lymphoma.
um, I need you to spread your legs so I can do an H.
can't be lymphoma.
LDH is normal.
he's got good liver function.
it's masking the elevated levels.
biopsy the lymph node.
check it out.
makes sense.
I guess you don't need me.
Oh, by the way, you might want to close the blinds.
a little bright in here.
it's just a wild coincidence that he thought you were a rude jerk.
come on. Give me the benefit of the doubt.
you said he's a jerk.
I barely talked.
you talked!
all I wanted was to sip morning espresso next to a peaceful, burbling fountain.
you could be sipping courvoisier next to a replica of the playboy grotto if you tell him what you got on him.
I don't have anything on him.
I don't want anything on him.
the closest he's been to Vietnam?
ordering the mee krob at that place on the corner.
mee krob is from Thailand.
exactly.
what did you do?
why do you think he's faking?
I saw his mail.
your broke in?
no.
he was holding it.
private medical insurance.
not from the V. A.
Plus, he's got to be early 50s.
he's too young to be a vet.
so I looked further.
you did break in.
online.
there's no reference to him in any of the vet records.
why would he fake being a veteran?
just look how you're acting.
people have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.
normally, we'd all tell the amputee to go screw himself.
victims get pity, heroes get adulation.
it's way better.
thank you for trying to help me out with my neighbor.
now forget the vietnam stuff.
I could prove this.
but you won't because you'll be too busy writing him a letter of apology and dropping it at his door without knocking at his door.
I didn't do anything.
that guy's a total ass.
which is the point.
it's easy to be nice to people you like.
but being nice to people you hate, that's a skill.
do it.
thank you for saving my life.
the man that tried to kill you, he said that you were preparing a massacre.
the Sitibi are my countrymen.
I am fighting a guerilla war.
in a way that's being called genocide.
20 years ago, these same Sitibi rebels took over the south, they massacred tens of thousands, and they would happily do it again.
I'm trying to impose order.
I'm trying to prevent a genocide.
genocide.
my own son, my youngest, he is a student here.
he hasn't spoken to me in years because of what he read in your newspapers.
but what he read is not true.
what about your youth labor league?
there I was at fault.
I hired men, who, in their zeal, stepped over the line, and there were abuses.
but that will not happen ain.
Hello?
how's it going?
normal-looking nucleus.
how's it going with you?
it worried me when you joked about letting that man shoot Dibala.
I wasn't joking.
you can't want to kill anyone, -especially not your own patient. -It's only natural to feel he should, no, it's completely unnatural.
only psychopaths can kill other people without having some sort of breakdown.
not when it's justified. Look at soldiers.
even when it's justified.
am I trying to kill our patient?
of course not.
but if he died, am I supposed to just pretend that wouldn't be good for the world?
the cells are neatly differentiated.
this isn't lymphoma.
thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine.
it smells like.
victory.
that big flag in your place prompted me to chat with your housekeeper.
turns out you're a citizen of the great white north.
you broke into my apartment?
technically, no.
well, technically, yeah, but two steps.
hardly-- you're going to jail.
speaking of, you know what can get you six months and a $100, 000 fine?
falsely claiming that you won a medal in Vietnam.
you think I'm faking?
canada did not send troops to fight in Vietnam, you idiot.
they sent troops to reinforce the '73 peace accords, which is where I tried to free a 12-year-old boy who stepped on a land mine.
36 years later, every second,
I feel the pain in my hand like I'm still grabbing that boy's arm, even though my arm isn't there.
so, no, I'm not faking.
on a related note, go maple leafs.
did you get the biopsy results?
is it lymphoma?
no.
so we have to move on.
infection, perhaps autoimmune. -Did you get the biopsy results?
Yes, I just told you.
is it lymphoma?
Camen and Chase?
they both really like diagnostics, and I think they both really like watching House torture me.
anyway, thank you for understanding about the job.
I had two really crappy alternatives.
there was a third.
what's that?
you could have stepped aside.
we both would have lost our jobs.
you could have asked Cameron or Chase to take your place.
they wouldn't have wanted to.
you just said they both really like diagnostics.
you want to go back in time?
I want to make this work.
I want to understand you.
I mean, you know how you made me feel.
if you could do it again...
I made the right decision.
I need your confidential medical opinion.
is the president capable of thinking clearly?
obviously not, right now.
will he ever be?
I think...
neurons don't grow back, and he's already in his cline.
anything he tells you, any command he gives, how will you ever know it's not just the delusions of a sick, mad, dying old man?
he just started spiking a fever.
it's scleroderma.
you don't have some clever way of telling me this time?
patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.
look at his skin.
it's tight for a 75-year-old.
based on his admission photo?
bit subjective.
fever points to infection.
and now he's got nodules his fingers.
that's blastomycosis.
Nodules?
and you're calling tight skin subjective?
I'm with Foreman.
we would have seen fungus balls on the head CT.
fungal lesions can be missed.
we could settle this with a test.
anticentromere antibodies would point to scleroderma.
point to, not prove.
and his fever's too high.
we have to treat him now.
we treat wrong, we could send this disease into overdrive.
you're with me on the scleroderma.
I guess. I just don't care enough about the patient -to waste my time trying to convince anyone. -We get it.
you don't like the guy, you didn't want to work on this case.
and yet you're still here.
why don't you take a stand?
either do something about it or shut up.
treat him for blasto if you want.
I'll get cuddy.
I can convince her-- this isn't a democracy.
I don't care who you get.
at least for right now, this is my department.
we're treating him for blasto.
start him on amphotericin B.
if you inject my I. V. with an air bubble...
what are you doing?
I will have another heart attack.
no one will know.
let her go.
you tell my colonel I'm a sick, dying old man who can't be trusted.
I didn't say...
you were trying to put a gun in his hand and point it at my head.
the gun is now in your hand.
that is a practical difference, not a moral one.
if you want me dead, then pull the trigger.
it is not so easy when you have to do it yourself.
I guess I didn't want you dead.
you touch my wife again, I'll kick your ass out into the street.
I don't care who you are.
I did her a favor.
I showed her her true character.
she's a better person than you are.
she is too weak to act on her beliefs.
but that is not her fault.
most everyone is.
even my own advisors.
my own colonel.
all they do negotiate and debate and sign treaties.
they are appeasers.
and all the while, we are beset by assassins and traitors, the scum -- cockroaches?
what are you going to do about them?
what is an enemy to you?
some younger physician who covets your office?
in my world, there are dangers and bloodshed and death.
and that makes you a man.
and men make choices.
and your choice is to send bands of drunk, crazed children to massacre an entire people?
don't ask me questions you don't want to know the answer to.
I saved your life.
I deserve to know what you're planning - -
whatever it takes to protect my country.
you broke into his apartment?
I didn't break in.
I wish I believed you.
I can fix this.
I already did.
he was going to press charges.
but...
I promised him you'd leave.
you're kicking me out?
I'll explain it to your psychiatrist, but...
Yeah. You got to go somewhere else.
house, I know when things go wrong, usually you just double down and get more involved, but here you could go to jail.
and I truly believe that you've changed enough to know this is the right thing.
we need a blood sample.
we got to do the antictromere antibody test.
it'll show House is right.
it's scleroderma.
why are you doing this now?
because I didn't want to kill him.
and you're right.
I have to take a side.
so I'm going to do what I can to keep him alive.
I'll get you the blood.
positive for anticentromere antibodies.
better get him off the antifungals and onto steroids immediately.
I told you before, this only points to scleroderma.
it doesn't prove it.
you're just gonna ignore the test?
blasto still fits best.
I know it's not conclusive, but when you put it with all the other evidence - - I've made my decision.
have you told Tirteen you were wrong to fire her?
what does that have to do with anything?
I've worked with you long enough to know you're reasonable.
you can usually admit when you're wrong.
but there's some deep part of you, that when you find you're wrong about the most important decisions you've made, you get insecure and you just retrench.
if you want to mess up your relationship, that's your right, but you mess this up, our patient dies.
switch him tsteroids.
Hi, honey.
how was your day?
morning.
first of all, my bad.
I've gone through this whole thing recently.
I don't want to bore you.
short version: I'm really trying to work on some stuff.
this is a definite setback.
although, in fairness, you really did make it tough.
phantom pain in your missing arm?
five different kinds of painkiller in your medicine cabinet.
that's what this magic box of neurological trickery is for.
this would be a lot easier if you do what the crazy guy who tied you up says.
put your hand in there.
put your hand in there.
now look.
it's mirror magic.
your arm is back.
now clench both your fists at the same time.
clench.
real hard.
if you believe in god, pray that this is gonna work.
you might also want to ask him why he blew off your arm.
ready?
now let go.
Oh, my god.
it relaxed.
for 36 years, I've been in pain.
and it's finally gone.
Oh, my god.
thank you.
O2 sat's down to 88.
going through the main stem bronchus.
into the right upper lobe.
get them out of here.
No!
it's okay
bleeder.
cauterizing.
got it?
Yeah.
get the paddles!
I'm going back in.
what is happening?
he's bleeding into his lungs.
charging.
another bleeder.
I can get it.
hold on.
there's a third.
God, there's a dozen.
shock him.
clear.
charging. Clear.
you want to curl up and cry, the lounge chair's a little more comfy.
I switched his meds.
I thought I was wrong, so I took him off the antifungals.
put him on steroids like you said.
you know what that means.
I was too late.
or I was right in the first place.
so either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion, or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion.
if you're anything like me -- and, by the way, you are
you need to know which.
he's under lock and key in the morgue.
his government wants their own doctors to do the autopsy.
they're taking his body out tomorrow.
there's a reason I hired you.
you used to know what to do with a locked door.
I went down to the morgue to rerun the antibodies test.
we ran it twice.
turns out I couldn't get in.
they had an armed guard.
but I saw this.
it's a sign-in sheet from the morgue.
your signature.
9: 45 this morning.
that's right before you guys ran the test.
what were you doing there?
follow-up on a clinic case.
what case?
you think this is really important -
one of the patients in the morgue was a 70-year-old woman who had scleroderma.
you and cameron, if you took that woman's blood, you could have messed up the test results so we treated Dibala for the wrong disease.
cameron had nothing to do with it.
you son of a bitch.
he was going to kill the Sitibi.
every last one of them.
I don't care what he was going to do.
he came to us and put his life in our hands.
all the good we've done...
every life we've saved...
it would have meant nothing if we just sent him off to kill hundreds of thousands of people.
look at the news.
the moderates are taking over.
there's hope for peace talks.
you tell the world that I faked this test, Dibala becomes a martyr.
the massacres begin.
I cover this up, I become your accomplice.
you think you can guilt me into that?
if the cops are going to come for me, please warn me...
so that I can tell my wife first.
you really think you can kill another human being without any consequences to yourself?
no.
american alligators are mostly found in the southeastern United States.
my neighbor called.
he sounded...
happy.
that's nice.
even nicer, he's approving the garden expansion.
and even more nicer, he's not going to press charges even if you don't move out.
what did you do to him?
I was nice.
you really want to know?
I think...
I want to give you the benefit of the doubt.
alligators eat fish, birds, turtles, snakes, mammals, and amphibians.
both: Oh!
left! Left! He's going left!
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
nowhere to go, buddy.
what the hell was that? What are we chasing?
go that way.
up, Donny, up. He's going for the roof.
he's going up, go.
Ow. Damn it.
just go, go!
Donny, no! It's too far!
I can rest at home.
we can't release you for at least two days.
you have two broken bones, a severe concussion,
collapsed lung.
but you didn't find anything life-threatening, right?
you fell 30 feet. You should have died.
I think that was the point. Could you shut up?
you have suicidal thoughts?
not once. Never.
he doesn't want to kill himself.
he just thinks he's gonna die soon,
so it doesn't really matter-- Now you shut up.
I'm the one you're not covering when you pull your crazy stunts.
why do you think you're gonna die soon?
well, my dad, grandfather, and great-Grandfather
all dropped dead of heart problems right after they turned 40.
look who turns 40 next week.
I can refer you to a cardiologist, if you-- Nah, i've been there,
all of them.
I spent my early 30s going from one doctor to another.
every single one says my heart's fine.
and you think they're wrong? -I know they're wrong.
but what can I do?
at a certain point, you just got to live your life.
by live your life,
you mean risk your life.
if there is something wrong,
I know a doctor who will find it.
Oh, god! I'll be back in ten.
I'm picking lint out of my belly button.
this is ridiculous.
I'm converting the study into a bedroom.
six weeks.
longer than i thought it would take...
for you to notice that i'm sleeping in your living room,
and offer other options.
I didn't expect you to be here this long.
true, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation.
do you really need to deconstruct this?
you didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.
okay, yes, you do. - After she died,
you converted the study to a bedroom
and the bedroom to a study...
except it's not a study, it's a shrine.
can I tell you something?
I wasn't picking lint out of my belly button.
okay.
I am not ready to transition from my dead girlfriend's shrine to your... morning glory.
I'll have a mattress delivered
and set up for you in the tabernacle.
I just need it Tuesdays for animal sacrifices.
Oh, man!
patient's a genetic time bomb.
there's no fuse.
he's not a bomb.
right now he's not a patient either.
you saying we ignore three generations of cardiac problems?
I'm not ignoring it.
I'm labeling it a coincidence.
you hate coincidence.
we reconciled. It was a whole thing.
big country.
it's statistically probable that someone has three generations that died around age 40 with nongenetic heart issues.
dice have no memory. -Genes do.
if we ran a battery of tests on every nonsymptomatic
statistical anomaly
the guy goes every day assuming his life will end at age 40.
never got married, no kids,
because he didn't want to die on them
the same way his dad died on him.
you want to take this case 'cause he's yet another
lonely, sad puppy.
you should have been a vet.
it's a legitimate case.
differential diagnosis for genetic heart conditions.
that sold you?
marfan syndrome, brugada. -And you?
Emilio hypercholesterolemia.
he's only agreeing with you 'cause he wants to have sex with you.
and by the way, i agree with you too,
especially in those pants.
we're not wasting our time.
and last week, Chase said that I was the defacto boss.
hospitals don't recognize defacto medical licenses.
let's start with genetic tests.
get an ekg, cardiac cath
and an echo to check the integrity of his heart.
I'll start on blood samples.
I forgot my watch. -Could have sworn
I saw you put it on this morning. -Must be in the locker room.
I'll be right back.
I need to know what your plans are.
first we take Berlin.
and then we circle around behind Poland
and yell, "surprise!"
with regards to your employment.
I like things the way they are.
I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you...
until now.
pretend time's been going on long enough.
I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.
and i'm gonna have payroll send you over some pretend checks starting tomorrow.
you need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify.
no, I don't.
I'm not saying you don't win.
I'm just saying do you really need to punish me by making me carry a clipboard for your lackey of the week?
it's a state requirement.
I have to certify that you've completed all your require
exactly.
the requirement sets out what you have to do
certify, which you can do with one hand tied behind your back.
now, if you want to tie my hands...
Dr. Singh supervises rounds on Thursdays,
starts at 7: 00.
nothing.
so what now?
send him home.
to continue believing he's gonna drop dead?
when he turns 70, he'll believe us.
there are other things we can check.
skeleton of great-Grandfather's in decent shape.
subsurface genetic material from Grandpa's fine,
leaving one bowl of purified Dad.
you do the Dad.
I take it he had a sealed casket.
the watch story was crap, right?
I forgot it.
it's no big deal.
you were avoiding the ICU Where Dibala died.
I'll sequence the gene for the cardiac sodium channel.
I felt like I was gonna have a panic attack.
I've crossed some line...
and I'm having trouble getting back to the other side.
I can move the patient to another room.
cameron will ask questions.
you should tell her.
she's your wife.
how'd you get a court order to dig them up so fast?
we just needed the guy's consent.
you find anything? -Not yet.
but you're just in time to do the Dad.
doctor House?
he'll be back in the morning.
I read in the paper you're treating a police officer.
Donny Compson? -Second floor.
a nurse will help you find him.
I don't want to see him.
Donny and I used to go out a long time ago.
he doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.
so did you come to see me for personal advice?
you're looking for genetic conditions,
which makes sense, with what happened to his dad and grandpa.
unless you were his girlfriend and his sister,
you got nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried about me.
Donny doesn't know this,
but he has a son.
dial extension 742.
tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information.
good night.
you okay?
Yeah, fine.
couldn't find any consistent genetic mutations across 15 areas between Donny's ancestors,
possibly indicating there isn't one.
but the son gives us a new data point.
and undegraded DNA.
I thought he didn't want kids.
he didn't. -Where's House?
dear bleeding hearts, "Since your patient's med history is a coincidence, "And he isn't...
sick, "I've gone back to school."
back in 120 hours.
charming. I'll get a blood sample.
if we're looking for something as subtle as a mutation,
it makes sense to get the DNA where it's most pure.
you're gonna ask the Mom to consent to a bone marrow biopsy?
she wants to know if there's something wrong with Donny just as badly as we do.
right.
spike a ten-year-old's hip because Grandpa was sick.
if she's right...
we save two people.
I don't want to.
can we speak outside for a moment?
Yeah.
you need to tell him.
I can't.
his father is down that hallway through those double doors.
I've been lying to him his whole life.
what's he gonna think of me?
you're trying to protect him.
Donny never wanted kids.
he certainly doesn't want to meet him.
if Donny does die, this could be Michael's only chance to meet his father.
after administration of immunoglobulin,
patient had no further pain, and overnight liver function tests are now normal.
patient's ready to be released.
stats are dropping.
doctor Singh? -She's choking.
on your fingers. -She can't breathe.
please take your finger off the test button.
I see. Wow, sorry about that.
I could've slit her throat.
well, we're all here to learn.
you know, Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.
she tell you how to stop me?
look, I'm asking you as an adult to please stop.
[Scoffs] well, that obviously didn't come from her.
but fair enough.
excellent presentation, Nona.
now I've done it.
there's urine everywhere!
gosh. The great thing about the teacher-student relationship is the teacher can often learn more from the student.
have you learned anything yet?
you have a son.
I was pregnant when we broke up.
I'm sorry I never told you,
but I knew how you felt about having kids.
you had no right.
maybe.
it's a little late for that.
he's here.
he wants to meet you.
I don't want to meet him.
I've never asked you for a dime.
he's here to help find whatever's wrong with your heart.
I didn't ask him.
I didn't want him.
just say hi to him.
Hi.
I'm michael.
Hi.
I'm your
Yeah, your mother told me.
when you get better,
maybe we could do something.
see a movie?
no.
my Dad died when i was your age.
it was the most painful thing I ever went through.
trust me, as much as I'm sure this hurts right now,
it's better.
please take him out of here.
chromosomes for 28 cardiovascular conditions are normally numbered in structure.
no translocations, deletions, or inversions.
I didn't notice that the kid's D-A-D-D-Y chromosome
has been severely damaged by someone else's bleeding heart chromosome.
it was the only way to get Michael to do the marrow biopsy.
I'm sure there are plenty of lies would've worked just as well,
except without the years of therapy.
don't you have school? -Recess.
so where does that leave us?
sorry. What?
I was saying, "do you think these shoes work in this color?"
send him home.
he's not gonna believe he's healthy.
you're not very good at your job.
you don't deserve candy. -He's been preparing his whole life to die at age 40.
he's had dozens of doctors tell him he's fine.
you think you can change his thinking?
Yeah, i do. Chase, walk with me.
great contributions back there.
there's no case. I had nothing to add.
you had nothing to add...
because you were distracted.
a little devil on your shoulder
told you to kill a guy, and now the little angel won't shut up,
telling you you're gonna burn in a lake of fire.
I'm fine.
you shouldn't be.
talk to someone.
docs fixed me up in seven weeks.
you're... ten minutes, tops.
Thanks.
glad we had this little moment.
come on.
I'm Dr. House.
you couldn't find anything, could you?
you have ortoli syndrome.
Dr. Chase?
you sure? -Tests don't lie.
right.
well, it's--It's a...
it's a very rare disorder that short-Circuits the adrenals,
which short-Circuits the heart.
blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares about medical mumbo jumbo?
tell him the treatment.
it's... well, it's--It's complicated.
doctors always want to make everything sound so complicated.
it's nabasynth.
what? -Nabasynth.
Yes.
so all we have to do now is write a prescription
and, uh, have him pick up the pills.
that's it?
I take some pills, and I'm gonna be okay?
the real tragedy here is that the tiburon swab technology didn't exist to detect ortoli back in your Dad's day.
he could've lived.
thank you.
if you'll sign these discharge papers,
I'll get you a bottle of meds.
take one twice a day for a week,
you'll live a long, healthy life.
answer the door, House.
it's got to be for you.
are you watching TV?
it's the door!
were you on the phone? -No.
just now, were you talking? -No. I'm alone.
you okay, House?
why are you here?
Donny collapsed four hours after we discharged him.
he's dead.
his apartment manager found him on the floor in the laundry room.
said he wasn't breathing.
he called the emts, but it was too late.
I sent the guy home with mints.
whatever it is, we all missed it.
I missed the fact that there was something to miss.
what is wrong with me?
you had good reason.
patient presented with no symptoms,
and all his tests came back negative.
what's the official cause of death?
autopsy hasn't been performed yet.
EMTs brought him to general,
but I requested they ship him back to our morgue for the postmortem.
good.
hon. Wake up.
why are you dressed?
you go to sleep?
I want to go tell Cheryl that Donny died.
it's 4: 00 in the morning.
they're nearly two hours away.
I figure by the time I get there, she'll be awake.
babe, come back to bed.
call her in a few hours.
it's the sort of thing she needs to hear face-to-face.
is everything okay?
everything's fine.
Why?
last week, I understood that you were stressed out about the Dibala,
and i gave you your space.
but that's over now, and you're still acting...
I'm worried about you.
don't be.
I'm fine.
really.
and you'd tell me if you weren't?
promise?
Yeah.
okay.
Hey.
I love you.
I love you too.
Donny compson, age 39.
it's his heart, so let's look at his heart.
nice y-Incision.
you can't perform an autopsy without a medical license.
Really?
cause i don't think there's anything I could screw up that we haven't already screwed up.
opening postmortem incision.
beginning at the midline of the sternum.
that's odd.
it almost looks like he's...
bleeding.
I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.
he was briefly conscious,
then his systolic dipped below 60,
and he was out again.
differential diagnosis for resurrection.
go. -Obviously he wasn't dead.
his heart slowed enough that the emts
Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong.
there's several documented cases
where tetrodotoxin ingestion caused apparent death.
it wasn't something he ate. It's something he already had.
and his Dad,
and his grandpa, and-- Extreme bradycardia
could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.
sinoatrial block. What if it's not his heart?
let's work from the tenuous assumption
that we're not idiots who've spent days examining a heart
up, down, sideways
declaring it healthy just a few hours before it basically shut down.
so we need to think about causes in places you didn't look.
could be metabolic.
you okay?
Yeah.
what about a genetic predisposition to an autoimmune disease?
isolated anti-Ro antibody
could cause complete heart block.
could also be passed through four generations.
autoimmune it is.
start him on steroids.
Hey. How you feeling?
my whole head is killing me.
you just came through a severe trauma.
what do you remember?
I was changing my laundry over to the dryer.
that's it?
you were declared dead.
you made it all the way to autopsy.
my jaw aches.
and obviously I don't have ortoli syndrome.
it's hard to get too excited about coming back from the dead
when anything I do, anything you give me
it all ends the same way.
outer and middle ear respond well.
hearing thresholds are normal at all frequencies.
eardrum is perfectly healthy.
what if i, uh...
if I sometimes hear whispering?
then you're probably hearing someone whispering.
I had some dental work done in the philippines when I was a kid.
adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up A. M. Radio signals.
open your mouth.
your fillings don't touch.
so there's no reason for me to be hearing things.
I can only tell you that you're hearing sounds as you should.
if you're also hearing sounds that you shouldn't,
well, that would be psychosis.
you'd have to talk to someone who does brain.
I only do ears.
Bravo!
it's amazing how you did 120 hours in one day.
I wasn't on my best behavior.
I admit.
allow me.
from now on, i'm gonna supervise your practicum requirements.
that won't be necessary.
you want to annoy another doctor first?
Eventually-- It's not necessary,
because i'm not ready to be a doctor again.
I'm sorry.
are you sleeping out here?
Just...dozed off in front of the TV.
with bedding?
maybe!
I can't sleep in there.
the heater's screwed up.
if you need to talk...
if--if you need more help
I'm just tired.
I'm right here.
great.
can you be right here somewhere else?
my jaw still hurts.
my tooth-- Actually, a lot.
I'm sorry, you're maxed out on your pain meds.
try to sleep.
dentist looked at the tooth the guy pulled out.
there was nothing wrong with it.
so aside from him being an idiot,
what else have we learned?
the pain is real. It's coming from somewhere.
what about bone cancer?
you can't connect bone cancer to the heart.
house figure this can wait till the morning?
actually, he told cuddy he's not ready to work.
he quit?
apparently. It's a power play.
he'll be back tomorrow.
bone cancer could trigger a paraneoplastic syndrome,
which shuts down the heart.
primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
it's hereditary, and it increases a person's risk of having bone cancer.
you have another theory?
my theory is it's not bone cancer.
gamma survey would locate the tumors.
I had pea soup today.
you'd love my breath right now.
I didn't get a chance to run tonight.
house is... is having issues.
I missed you a lot today.
all I want to do is...
you know.
no cancers on the lateral cuneiform bone.
Navicular's also clean.
chase is lying to me.
and I know you know.
tell me what's going on, please.
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told him...
talk to your spouse.
no breakfast?
not today.
I'm hallucinating.
what happened?
it's nothing visual this time.
I hear whispering.
is that why you've been acting so weird?
is that why you quit? -I'm losing it.
I'm sure there's a rational explanation.
the wind?
a neighbor's TV? -I checked everything.
what's really scary is that I hear whispering while not on vicodin.
I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.
okay.
okay?
you don't think there might be a logical explanation?
something I missed?
you're the smartest guy I know.
if you haven't thought of it, it doesn't exist.
I'll drive you over.
I just need to make some tea first.
you know.
that you're an ass? Yeah.
you overheard me talking to my dead girlfriend
and thought to yourself,
what kind of fun can I have with this?
why are you talking to her?
you run out of living people?
you can talk to me. I'm right here.
I miss her.
talking to her makes me feel better.
you don't.
patient Lauren Maybaum, 27,
presented two days ago with severe abdominal pain.
sorry I'm late.
yesterday you said you weren't ready.
yesterday I wasn't.
today I am. -And tomorrow
is it possible for me to get a five-day forecast?
I'm feeling much better. Thank you for not asking.
either you did have a problem
which i can't ignore.
or you were jerking me around
which i can't ignore. -You are a woman.
you can do anything.
for example, I can talk to you outside.
are you sure you're only one woman?
this is the part where you play the employee, and I play the boss.
I can see your nipples. Your turn.
these kids are -- No wonder she hates him.
mm, that's not hate.
it's foreplay. -It's inappropriate.
gamma survey revealed no tumors.
so it's not bone cancer.
Where's Chase?
don't know.
two mysteries, cool.
theories?
did I come in too soon?
okay, I'm gonna take another lap.
and I want three new ideas by the time I come back.
one of them's got to be not stupid.
where there's pain... there's nerves.
hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type one.
miscommunication in the brain stem mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.
it would explain the bradycardia too.
and I like the word "hereditary" in the title.
carbamazepine fixes him.
I'll get him started on the medication.
Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.
sleep at home.
so I didn't do the gamma survey.
is it bone cancer? No.
you should congratulate me for not wasting your time.
are you getting some help?
or is this the way things are gonna be from now on?
what's pathetic is you haven't gotten help because you want to feel bad.
you want to suffer, 'cause if you feel guilty, then you're not a psychopath.
patient needs some carbamazepine.
now, I don't care how much that room scares you,
you're doing your job.
how long before you cross this one off the list?
a couple of hours.
you ever shoot anyone?
twice.
you ever kill anyone?
no.
I know a few guys who did, though.
did they ever get over it?
a captain I know compares it to taking out the trash,
like it's nothing.
other hand, I got an ex-partner who nearly drank himself into oblivion.
did he get help?
Yeah.
help didn't help.
Oh, god!
what is it?
I went to the bathroom.
patient's lost bowel control.
means we were wrong about h-San,
and it means he's getting worse fast.
"Doody" nurse?
fine. Do the doctor thing.
an autoimmune disorder could explain
we put him on steroids. He didn't respond.
it's not autoimmune. -Could be wilson's disease.
a disease that advanced would've hit the liver.
it is possible the liver's so far gone,
the labs look normal.
it's worth a shot.
go treat with penicillamine.
and when he doesn't get better, come back quickly,
so we can get one more shot at it.
bless me, father, for I have sinned.
take your time.
how long has it been since your last confession?
I killed a man.
but it was the right thing to do.
who lives or dies is not your decision to make.
sometimes in the operating room it feels like it.
I'm a doctor.
well, then you should know more than anybody
that every human life is sacred.
Why?
tell me what's sacred about a dictator that kills hundreds of thousands of his own people.
what is sacred about a doctor who kills a patient?
is it just the slippery slope you're worried about?
afraid that forgiving me for killing ???
I promise...
I won't tell anyone.
just forgive me.
saying ten hail isn't going to do you any good.
then what do i have to do?
what does god need me to do?
you can't have absolution without first taking responsibility.
you have to turn yourself into the police.
what...
and go to jail for the rest of my life?
what's just about that?
I did the right thing.
there has to be another way.
you want absolution, I've told you how to get it.
send this into the state licensing board.
I've signed off on all your hours.
Why?
because it's easier this way.
you're uncomfortable with me.
no.
going by the book was pointless.
you were gonna learn nothing.
good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension.
there was no sexual tension.
there was tension.
and...it made me feel funny, so...
here.
that's too bad.
I was kind of getting into the whole Hot-For-Teacher thing.
you sure you're okay?
Yeah. False alarm.
what about us?
we're good...
just like this.
you press my buttons, i press yours.
by buttons, you mean...
you do make me feel funny.
you're not gonna die.
I've accepted it.
it's okay.
in addition to high arches
and some crystal bowl in the shape of a tuna,
you also inherited a self-destruct button.
it forms in the brain stem.
technically, it's an aneurysm.
presses on the nerves,
that control everything from tooth pain to heart rate.
as you get older, it gets bigger,
until finally...
the button
which i'll call intracranial berry aneurysm, 'cause I had a friend in high school with that name
stops the signal from your brain to your heart.
and bam!
how do I know you're not still lying to me?
saying I'm healthy just to make me feel better?
it does sound that way, doesn't it?
but this time, no sugar pills.
I'm gonna cut into your brain to make you think that I'm fixing it.
and if our fake tests confirm it,
I'm gonna be cutting into your son's brain too, 'cause i'm just that committed.
Michael's gonna be okay?
unless he walks out of here and gets run over by a bus,
in which case, I will reconsider your fate argument.
you want to give him a call?
visiting hours don't apply to my patients.
yeah...
in a bit.
Yeah.
that's what I thought.
the "saving the kid from pain" stuff was crap.
you just don't want anything in your life that won't let you do whatever the hell you want to do whenever the hell you want to do it.
you've had it easy.
sorry to screw you up.
maybe when we get out of here...
what kind of movies you like?
he's been missing for eight hours.
C-H-A-S-E. Hey!
never mind, he just walked in, sorry.
you could've called me.
Oh, I-I forgot.
to call me? It's 2: 00 in the morning.
where were you?
Ooh, you're drunk.
all right, I...
I needed to get wasted. I did.
and now I'm better.
what aren't you telling me?
nothing.
Hi, Dad.
this is stupid.
you see, he really is getting better.
[Woman On P. A.] Any additional R. N. To Surgical. Any additional R. N. To Surgical.
[House] Why do you want me to treat this guy?
blood pressure's not responding to I. V. Fluids.
no, no. I didn't ask how you plan to con me into treating him.
I asked you why you want me to treat him.
he's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.
there are about a billion sick people on the planet. Why this one?
because this one's in our emergency room. Ah, so it's a proximity issue.
if somebody was sick in the third-floor stairwell, that's who'd we be talking about.
Yes. I checked the stairwell. It's clear.
okay, then. Emergency room guy it is. [Elevator Bell Dings]
wait. Why was that so easy? You know why.
blood pressure's not responding to I. V. Fluids? - Yeah.
that's just weird.
C. B.C. Was unremarkable. Abdominal C. T. Scan didn't show anything.
so, people, differential diagnosis. What's wrong with her?
him. - Him. Her. Does it matter?
does anyone think it's a testicular problem? No. So, Chase?
yersinia infection? - No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.
what about arthritis? Accompanying vasculitis causes nerve damage
no. It wouldn't cause the blood pressure problems. Allergy? - The kid's got abdominal pain.
maybe carcinoid? No. But then you wouldn't get the
Foreman, if you're going to list all the things it's not, it might be quicker to do it alphabetically.
let's see, now. "Absidia." Excellent. Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.
no condition accounts for all these symptoms. - Oh, good.
because I thought maybe he was sick. But, apparently, he's not.
who wants to do up the discharge papers? [Sighs]
[Sighs] Okay. Unless we control the blood pressure, he's gonna start circling the drain before we can figure out what's wrong with him.
treat him for sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and I want a Cort-stim test and an echocardiogram.
you all right? [Coughs] Yeah.
the Cort-stim test will tell us if your pituitary and adrenal glands are working properly.
his glands? What does that mean? - We have a few theories we're working on.
you mean you don't know. - Mindy.
I'm just saying, if they knew they wouldn't be testing you, they'd be treating you.
Yeah, well, that's the way it works. First we find out what it is, then we get you better.
you're half an hour late. Busy caseload.
one case is not a load.
so how are we doing on cotton swabs today? If there's an acute shortage, I could run home
no, you couldn't. Nice.
Hello, sick people and their loved ones.
in the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot ofboring chitchat later, I'm Dr. Gregory House.
you can call me Greg. I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.
short. Sweet. Grab a file. This ray of sunshine is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.
Dr. Cuddy runs this whole hospital, so, unfortunately, she's much too busy to deal with you.
I am a board-certified diagnostician, with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology.
I'm also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic who is forced to be here against his will.
that is true, isn't it? But not to worry.
because for most of you, this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.
speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this.
this is Vicodin. It's mine. You can't have any.
and, no, I do not have a pain management problem. I have a pain problem.
but who knows? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.
so, who wants me?
and who would rather wait for one of the other two guys?
okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room One if you change your mind.
Jodi Matthews?
please accompany Dr. House to Exam Room One.
Dr. Chase.
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend is the best medicine for him right now.
I know. I get stupid when I'm scared. Don't go rock climbing.
look, I was wondering. Before this happened, we were having sex.
[Sighs] What? You're wondering if whatever he has, you might've gotten it?
it-it's unlikely. We ran a complete S. T.D. Panel, so
no. I'm wondering if maybe I did this to him. I was kind of rough.
it was yellow. It was?
it's not anymore. Well, that's a shame.
I thought that might be a problem, so I brought you this.
your mucus was "pale goldenrod.
last week, yes. Should I be worried? Oh, yes. Very.
Really? I thought it was okay now.
and yet, here you are. What happened?
paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?
you're not a very nice doctor, are you?
and you are very bad at whatever it is you do.
you don't even know me. I know you're gonna get fired.
that's why you got the new glasses. That's why your teeth are sparkly white.
you're getting the most of your health insurance while you still can.
I might be quitting. [Zipper Zips]
if you were quitting, you'd have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod. You're getting fired.
I just don't like being told what to do.
I can get you in for a full body scan later this week.
Thanks.
it's got to be viral. We should start running gels and titers.
maybe we should look into the girlfriend's theory. She thinks she rode him to death.
[Chuckles] What'd you tell her?
I told her 22-year-old men don't die of sex.
What'd you ask her? - What do you mean?
I mean, I hope you got some specifics on exactly what was going on.
if the girl thinks it could kill you, it's worth knowing about.
have you ever taken a life?
we should stop the antibiotics.
it's too soon to say they're not having an effect.
they're having an effect.
his B. P. 's falling fast. There's fluid filling his lungs.
his creatinine is rising.
his kidneys are shutting down.
our treatment isn't making him better. It's killing him.
so, we had six symptoms that didn't add up to anything. Now we got seven. Who's excited?
I don't think it complicates things. The kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.
maybe. - Typically, low blood pressure and abdominal pain means an infection.
an abdominal infection causes sepsis, low blood pressure.
except we checked for abdominal infections.
but what if it's the other way around? What if the low blood pressure's causing the abdominal pain?
viral heart infection. The intestines aren't getting enough blood, and the result is belly pain.
I know it's not the standard presentation. - It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.
I thought that's what we dealt with here.
it explains the cardiomyopathy, the pain, the low B. P. the fever.
you read the book. Impressive.
it's a ludicrously long shot that explains every one of those symptoms- except for the cough and the rash.
should we just erase those? Well, anything can cause a rash.
okay. Cardiac infection.
cameron, you thought allergy. - Mm-hmm.
chase, what was it you thought? Carcinoid?
then there's hypothyroidism.
could be parasites.
finally, sinus infection.
if you're gonna list all the things it can't be, you're gonna need more colors.
cameron was right. No condition explains all these symptoms.
but orange and green covers everything. - Orange and green?
two conditions contracted simultaneously?
occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is always the best.
and you think one is simpler than two? - Pretty sure it is, yeah.
baby shows up. Chase tells you that two people exchanged fluids to create this being.
I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper. Are you gonna go with the two or the one?
I think your argument is specious. - I think your tie is ugly.
why is one simpler than two? It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?
each one of these conditions is about a thousand-to-one shot.
that means that any two of them happening at the same time is a million-to-one shot.
chase says the cardiac infection is a 10 million-to-1 shot, which makes my idea 10 times better than yours.
get a calculator. Run the numbers.
we'll run the tests. Tests take time.
treatment's quicker. Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection, and... what was orange? [Cameron] Hypothyroidism.
my uncle has hypothyroidism. Not like this.
intravenous Levothyroxin is an artificial thyroid medication that should take care of it.
also, the nurses are going to start you on Unasyn. It's a more targeted antibiotic.
for the sinus infection? Yes.
the other stuff is for something else entirely. - Bad luck, huh?
don't worry. He should be back to ditching work in no time.
Brandon?
Hey, Mom. [Coughs]
we're his parents. How's he doing?
um, Brandon is
uh, Mom. Dad-[Clears Throat] This is Mindy.
I was gonna bring her home for Christmas. Um, we're engaged.
[Woman On P. A.] Dr. Hall to the recovery room. Dr. Hall
did you tell the family House's theory?
two odd conditions striking completely coincidentally at the exact same time?
I didn't phrase it quite that way. They agree to treatment?
of course they did. We're doctors. They believe whatever we tell them.
so, is that our job? House's puppets?
he comes up with an insane idea, we get to pretend it's not?
his insane ideas are usually right. We've been here long enough to
we've been here long enough to have Stockholm syndrome. [Laughs]
what, because we don't hate him? He thinks outside the box. Is that so evil?
he has no idea where the box is.
if you guys think he's right, go home. Relax. Just wait for the kid to get all better.
I'm going to the lab to test for viral infections.
negative for Coxsackie "B" virus.
seven down, about 5, 000 to go.
you really think we're gonna come up with your mystery virus just by running gels till we guess it right?
no. I think we're gonna do it by standing around watching other people work.
I'm waiting for the Epstein-Barr virus.
she's weird, isn't she? - Bad idea.
what? - Bad idea. You work with her.
what did I say?
is weird some new ghetto euphemism for sexy, like bad is good and phat is good?
then what the hell does "good" mean? - "Ghetto euphemism"?
[Scoffs] - You don't think she's hot?
no.
Wow. Then you're brilliant. And I am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.
obviously, the girl is hot. Y-You're not talking about her aesthetics.
you're talking about if I want to jump her. I don't.
brilliant.
[Machine Beeps] - Your Epstein-Barr is ready.
what are you doing? Level four.
no, no. I mean- I know what you meant. We're waiting.
my throat hurts. So you said.
how long are we waiting? Two minutes less than when you asked me two minutes ago.
Hi. - Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.
Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. His throat seems to have some condition.
say "Ah." Ah. [Mumbles]
he has a sore throat.
of course. Yes, why didn't l
I mean, because he said that it hurt, and I should have deduced that meant it was sore.
I was in a board meeting. Patients come first, right?
wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there's any doubt about its efficacy, huh?
you once asked me why I think I'm always right, and I realized that you're right.
at least, I think you're right. I don't really know, now do I?
Hey. I'm here. - Go home. Drink some hot tea.
[Exhales] Excellent counsel.
negative on parvovirus B-19.
I'm impressed. Thank you. I was born to run gels.
I meant about Chase. What about Chase?
well, the man has no physical interest in you.
he has a completely professional relationship with you, respects you as a colleague and a doctor.
and yet, he can't look at you without thinking sex.
because I asked what kind of sex could kill you?
you now have total control over your relationship with him.
so, a woman can't express her interest in sex without it being some professional power play?
no. If you look the way you do and you say what you said, you have to be aware of the effect that it's going to have on men.
men should grow up. - Yeah, and dogs should stop licking themselves.
it's not gonna happen. What's going on?
Yeah, what are you doing here? - Looking for you guys.
why didn't you page us? - 'Cause I knew you'd be here.
who told him? No one.
I assume you're trying to prove my crazy, two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you're gonna be in the lab.
you spin the urine? - Not yet.
talk to me when you have.
What'd you find out? Kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.
I wonder if that's significant. - It means the antibiotics didn't cause the kidney failure.
how'd you know?
if you guys hadn't been so busy trying to prove me wrong, you might've checked in on the poor kid.
you visited a patient?
I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he'd know someone was there for him.
I looked in on him. He's much better.
ergo, the treatment's working. Ergo, me right, you wrong.
Hey, I'm glad for the kid.
that smugness of yours really is an attractive quality. Thank you.
it was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.
I get that you're not a big believer in the "catching flies with honey" approach, but do you honestly think you'll collect a jarful by cleverly taunting them?
flies, no. Doctors, sure. If I'd said to Foreman, "Nice try. Great guess, but sorry, not this time," what do you think he'd be doing right now?
I think he'd go home not feeling like a piece of crap. Exactly.
you want him to feel like a piece of crap? No. I don't want him going home.
Dr. Foreman. [Coughs]
still have the cough. I'm feeling a lot better though.
his fever is gone. His rash is going away. [Chuckles]
I see. Is everything okay?
just ordering some tests. Absolutely nothing to worry about.
how much longer? - 9: 30. I figure she was on the eighth hole when I paged her.
you probably got another half hour.
I ran a T. S.H. T3 and T4. The patient's negative for hypothyroidism. I'm not talking about you.
the fact that he's getting better would indicate the unreliability of the tests.
if I'm right and it's a viral infection, one of two things always happen:
the patient dies, or the patient's immune system fights off the invader.
what's with her?
her leg hurts after running six miles. Who knows? Could be anything.
he's getting better. That doesn't prove you're right. That just proves he's getting better.
it-it's not two illnesses. It can't be two illnesses.
I am so glad you work here.
[Exhales] If I'm right, the antibiotics you prescribed...
could box his kidneys and liver, impeding his ability to fight off the virus.
it could kill him. - Well, that certainly would be a concern.
fifty bucks?
don't look away. The space monkeys will be all over you.
you wanna bet on the patient's health? - You think that's bad luck?
you think that God will smite him because of our insensitivity?
well, if God does, you make a quick 50.
Oh. - Go check his white blood count.
if he's fighting off a virus like you think, it'll be way up.
Hey. Cuddy said you needed a consult. What's up? I'm busy.
Oh!
I was just being glib. - You haven't said anything.
no. Before, when I was talking about Brandon's girlfriend thinking sex could kill you.
I was just making a joke because I was uncomfortable.
Oh, I don't even remember what you said. I'm uncomfortable about sex.
well, we don't have to talk about this. - Sex could kill you.
do you know what the human body goes through when you have sex?
pupils dilate. Arteries constrict.
core temperature rises, heart races, blood pressure skyrockets.
respiration becomes rapid and shallow.
the brain fires bursts of electrical impulses from nowhere to nowhere.
secretions spit out of every gland, and the muscles tense and spasm like you're lifting three times your body weight.
it's violent, it's ugly, and it's messy.
and if God hadn't made it unbelievably fun, the human race would've died out eons ago.
men are lucky they can only have one orgasm.
you know that women can have an hour-long orgasm?
Hey, Foreman. What's up?
Hey, Foreman. - Hey.
white cell count isn't up, is it? - No. We were both wrong.
white cell count is down- way down-and dropping.
his immune system is shot. We need to get him into a clean room.
[Chase] Can you walk, Brandon?
Yeah. A little.
okay. 'Cause we'll need to leave the chair outside. Thank you.
Where's April? April?
can you take that chair, please? Thank you. Yes, Robert.
I'll need to take your, um- your mask and your robe too.
you might wanna block your ears for this, it's quite loud.
something's made him immuno-compromised.
his white blood cell count is down, which means his body can't fight off infections.
if he gets sick, he'll die. Sick? How sick?
Lfhe gets a cold, he'll die.
okay. I'm gonna push the needle into your hip bone and take some of the marrow.
that's not so bad.
Uh-uh. That was just the anesthetic. [Instrument Clatters On Table]
the core biopsy needle, it's a bit bigger.
Hey, man. Take a deep breath. This-This is gonna hurt... a lot.
your marrow makes the blood cells.
we take a peek at it under a microscope, and maybe we find a viral infection.
maybe we find some fibrosis.
something to explain why your blood count is so low.
there we go.
one step closer to an answer.
[Shaky Breath] If you don't find one,
I can't stay here forever.
[House] The patient could've died. - The one with the pulled muscle?
those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions.
[Stammers] I'm entitled to a consult. - You are not getting out of clinic duty.
come on. You got a hundred other idiot doctors in this building who go...
all warm and fuzzy every time they pull a toy car out of a nose- you don't need me here.
no, I don't. But working with people actually makes you a better doctor.
when did I sign up for that course? When did I give you the impression that I care?
working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion.
I've got your home number, right? In case anything comes up at 3: 00 in the morning.
it's not gonna work. You know why?
because this is fun.
you think of something to make me miserable. I think of something to make you miserable
it's a game, and I'm gonna win because I got a head start. You are already miserable.
uh- Is this important?
uh, no. Good.
what's with you and her? Don't.
you have a thing for her? The only people who can get to you
no. There is not a thin line between love and hate.
there is, in fact, a Great Wall of China, with armed sentries posted every 20 feet between love and hate.
thirty-six Vicodin. Who's the patient?
I am. You can't
Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician. Yeah.
you will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want, but you're incapable of kissing a little ass?
[Pills Rattle] We all have our limitations.
house? Wrong bottle. Do me a favor.
take one of these, wait five minutes for it to kick in, then find Cuddy and kiss her ass.
what was the kid's first symptom?
you did the history. Of his 800 symptoms, which one hit him first?
uh, the cough.
gout.
um, are we talking about Brandon? Gout?
uric acid crystals in the joints?
the symptoms are pain, swelling, redness, stiffness. Not one of which do I see on that board.
because he doesn't have gout. [Makes Popping Sound]
every day, cells die.
we survive because the remaining cells divide and replace the losses.
the colchicine, a gout medicine, blocks mitosis and stops cell division, which will result in abdominal pain, rash, nausea, fever, kidney failure, low blood pressure...
and will also mess with the bone marrow.
but he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?
because you guys were right. He didn't have two conditions at the exact same time.
first, he got a cough. And because he's an idiot, he went to a doctor.
in order to justify charging $200, that doctor felt he should actually do something.
Oops. He wrote a prescription.
seven thousand people die each year from pharmacy screwups.
not nearly as many as die from doctor screwups, but still, not something they use in their promotional materials.
the pharmacist gave him gout medicine instead of cough medicine.
and the only thing it wouldn't do, it would do absolutely nothing to relieve his cough.
occam's Razor
the simplest explanation is almost always that somebody screwed up.
but once he checked into this hospital, he was completely in our control.
our food, our pills, our everything.
so even if you're right, no more gout medication.
he'd either continue to deteriorate, or he would've gotten better.
but he got better, and then he got worse.
it doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.
okay. Two people screwed up.
not as simple as one, but
he's resting. He's- I'm Dr. House.
I'm your son's physician. Oh. You're the one we haven't met yet.
you're the one he hasn't met. How can you treat someone without meeting them?
it's easy if you don't give a crap about him.
that's a good thing.
if emotions made you act rationally, well, they wouldn't be called emotions, right?
that's why we have this nice division of labor. You hold his hand, I get him better.
if I start tucking him in at night, well, that's not fair to you guys.
and if you start prescribing medicine, well, that's not fair to me.
so, what I wanna know is, who stepped on my side of the net?
who cared enough to get stupid enough to give him his cough medicine?
when we checked in, Dr. Foreman
tuesday, he's getting better. Wednesday, he's getting sick again.
somebody gave him his cough medicine Wednesday.
come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.
I just wanna know who tried to kill the kid.
Dr. House, maybe we should- - His throat was sore.
page Dr. Occam. He's gonna wanna hear about this. I'm sorry.
he was coughing, and I just wanted to help him- Aren't you a dear.
where are the pills? He took the last of'em before he was switched into that room.
they're all gone? It was just cough medicine.
no, it wasn't. Where's the bottle?
we need to know exactly what you put in this bottle.
we think it was colchicine, a gout medication.
if the prescription said cough medicine, that's what I dispensed.
the family is prepared to waive liability, all right?
we just need to know what it was, what dosage it was- It was cough medicine.
refill it.
he's gonna be okay. You don't know that.
does Brandon like that quality in you?
you're a little negative.
things don't always work out for the best. Doesn't hurt to hope they do.
no. Not unless that makes you figure you can do whatever you want, like give people cough medicine.
this is cough medication. This is what Brandon was supposed to get.
they're small, round and yellow.
can you tell this man what the pills in your son's medicine bottle actually looked like?
they were small, round and yellow, exactly like this.
those were the pills that Brandon was taking.
Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.
[House] It was so perfect. It was beautiful.
beauty often seduces us on the road to truth.
and triteness kicks us in the nads.
so true. This doesn't bother you?
that you were wrong? I try to work through the pain.
I was not wrong. Everything I said was true. It fit. It was elegant.
so, reality was wrong? - [Sighs] Reality's almost always wrong.
the cough medicine did something.
[Exhales] Aggravated the condition.
it's all over the place. Must be in his blood.
what if it is his blood? - Lymphoma?
unless you've got something better.
we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his C. T. Scan showed no adenopathy,
C. B.C. Showed a normal differen-smear, bone marrow showed no- Screw the tests.
do an exploratory laparotomy and find out what's in there.
he has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him.
Yeah, you're right. Let's stick with the wrong pill theory.
I'll schedule him for surgery.
[Foreman] Okay, Brandon, we're running this tube through your heart...
and into the pulmonary arteries in your lungs.
[Cameron] The sensors will give us information we need for the exploratory surgery later this afternoon.
my fingers are numb. - Try not to move.
we're in the right atrium, trying to catch the flow through the tricuspid valve.
[Chase] I think the catheter's curling in the atrium.
got it. We're in the R. V. Now.
[Beeps] Ectopy.
you must've irritated the heart wall. - It'll calm down.
he can't tolerate any cardiac arrhythmia. Pull back. - He needs the surgery.
[High-pitched Tone] - Pressure's dropped.
you still with us, Brandon? - Get the curtains.
V. F.
[Chase] Charging. Clear.
[Rhythmic Beeping] - [Exhales] Sinus rhythm.
I got a pulse.
Yeah, but no surgery today.
How're you doing? - Okay.
great. I'm doing good too.
I get to knock off an hour early today. You know why?
because I kissed my boss's ass. Do you ever do that?
I think she just said yes 'cause she wants to reinforce that behavior.
wants me to kiss a lot of other people's ass, like she wants me to kiss yours.
what would you want? A doctor who holds your hand while you die, or a doctor who ignores you while you get better?
I guess it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.
I should go. - You think it's gonna come out on its own?
are we talking bigger than a breadbasket?
because, actually, it will come out on its own.
which for small stuff is no problem. It's wrapped up in a nice, soft package, and plop.
big stuff, you're gonna rip something, which, speaking medically, is when the fun stops. How did you
you've been here half an hour, you haven't sat down. That tells me its location.
you haven't told me what it is. That tells me it's humiliating.
you have a little birdie carved on your arm. That tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation.
so I figure it's not hemorrhoids.
I've been a doctor 20 years. You're not gonna surprise me.
[Exhales] It's an MP3 player.
Mm.
is it- Is it because of the size, or the shape, or is it the pounding bass line?
what are we gonna do?
I'm gonna wait. - For what?
okay. It's 3: 00. I'm off.
would you tell Dr. Cuddy there's a patient in Exam Room Two needs her attention?
and the R. I.A. A. Wants her to check for illegal downloads.
Brandon's not ready for surgery. Okay.
let's leave it a couple of weeks. He should be feeling better by then. Oh, wait. Which way does time go?
he crashed during prep. He's also experiencing pain in his fingers.
think some bug may have gotten in the clean room.
I think we should double his dosage of G-CSF to temporarily boost his white blood cell count.
pain in his fingers. Right.
hi again. He can't
Where's he going? [Hissing]
Hey. How you all doing?
interesting fact. Every seven years, it's a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?
Dr. House, this is a clean room. Yeah. I read the sign.
but cells of different organs reproduce at different rates.
[Groans] - So, you get a new kidney every three years.
get a new stomach lining every week.
this is why colchicine poisoning causes all these symptoms, but not all at once.
but we went to the pharmacy. We saw the pills.
colchicine does its damage in a very specific order.
first of all, there's the pain in the abdomen, the rash, the fever. Isn't that what you got first?
then the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to
Brandon. - Right.
then it screws up your bone marrow, and then neuropathy.
[Brandon Groans] A painful tingling in the fingers and toes.
and what do you suppose happens after that? [Grunts]
hair loss. The bad news is...
your special boy is doing drugs. [Mom] No, he's not.
ecstasy? No.
twice with Dan and Mike. - You know what they cut that stuff with?
apparently, colchicine. Unless you ingested the colchicine through your contact lens solution, or skin cream or some other drug you're lying about.
I don't know how it happened. I don't care how it happened. It happened. Start, uh
Brandon. - Lovely name.
start Brandon on FAB fragments, and get him some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out.
and get some air in here.
make a note. I should never doubt myself.
I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong every now and then.
what, you don't care about these people?
the colchicine interferes with the ability of the heart muscle to contract, pumping blood, lowering your blood pressure.
the antibodies we're giving you should neutralize the colchicine, allowing your heart to beat at its normal rate.
when will you know?
we know now.
thank God. [Laughs]
Mmm.
big weekend? It's not for me. I'm fully stocked.
Cuddy got you doing inventory? - Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.
the gout medicine O. D? Yeah.
the fact that I know it's a gout medicine O. D. Would indicate the case is already solved.
well, you'd be wrong.
what about the fact that the kid is now- I believe the technical term is- "not sick"?
you know how many forms of colchicine there are on the market?
stop it. - Neither do I. But it's a lot.
pills, powders, liquids, I. V. Fluids.
somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.
you're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?
he said he used it twice. - People lie.
if you're gonna lie, it's- - You know what? I'm not interested.
not curious? - No. Because I'm well-adjusted.
right.
temperature's normal. I want cousin Sharon there.
if we invite Sharon, we have to invite all the cousins.
so what? My side of the family doesn't need anything.
I don't suppose I could have some of those cough pills, huh? They're okay, right?
Yes. You're doing great. - You should invite Dr. House.
[Brandon] Will he come? - No. But he'll send a gift.
[Laughs] I'll make sure it's a good one.
there's a letter on the back of these pills.
your old pills didn't have a letter on them?
no. Round and yellow, but no letter.
well, these will help your cough.
Hey, you wanna go get some- No.
[Woman On P. A.] Any additional R. N. To Surgical. Any additional R. N. To Surgical.
[House] Why do you want me to treat this guy?
blood pressure's not responding to I. V. Fluids.
no, no. I didn't ask how you plan to con me into treating him.
I asked you why you want me to treat him.
he's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.
there are about a billion sick people on the planet. Why this one?
because this one's in our emergency room. Ah, so it's a proximity issue.
if somebody was sick in the third-floor stairwell, that's who'd we be talking about.
Yes. I checked the stairwell. It's clear.
okay, then. Emergency room guy it is. [Elevator Bell Dings]
wait. Why was that so easy? You know why.
blood pressure's not responding to I. V. Fluids? - Yeah.
that's just weird.
C. B.C. Was unremarkable. Abdominal C. T. Scan didn't show anything.
so, people, differential diagnosis. What's wrong with her?
him. - Him. Her. Does it matter?
does anyone think it's a testicular problem? No. So, Chase?
yersinia infection? - No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.
what about arthritis? Accompanying vasculitis causes nerve damage
no. It wouldn't cause the blood pressure problems. Allergy? - The kid's got abdominal pain.
maybe carcinoid? No. But then you wouldn't get the
Foreman, if you're going to list all the things it's not, it might be quicker to do it alphabetically.
let's see, now. "Absidia." Excellent. Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.
no condition accounts for all these symptoms. - Oh, good.
because I thought maybe he was sick. But, apparently, he's not.
who wants to do up the discharge papers? [Sighs]
[Sighs] Okay. Unless we control the blood pressure, he's gonna start circling the drain before we can figure out what's wrong with him.
treat him for sepsis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and I want a Cort-stim test and an echocardiogram.
you all right? [Coughs] Yeah.
the Cort-stim test will tell us if your pituitary and adrenal glands are working properly.
his glands? What does that mean? - We have a few theories we're working on.
you mean you don't know. - Mindy.
I'm just saying, if they knew they wouldn't be testing you, they'd be treating you.
Yeah, well, that's the way it works. First we find out what it is, then we get you better.
you're half an hour late. Busy caseload.
one case is not a load.
so how are we doing on cotton swabs today? If there's an acute shortage, I could run home
no, you couldn't. Nice.
Hello, sick people and their loved ones.
in the interest of saving time and avoiding a lot ofboring chitchat later, I'm Dr. Gregory House.
you can call me Greg. I'm one of three doctors staffing this clinic this morning.
short. Sweet. Grab a file. This ray of sunshine is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.
Dr. Cuddy runs this whole hospital, so, unfortunately, she's much too busy to deal with you.
I am a board-certified diagnostician, with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology.
I'm also the only doctor currently employed at this clinic who is forced to be here against his will.
that is true, isn't it? But not to worry.
because for most of you, this job could be done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.
speaking of which, if you're particularly annoying, you may see me reach for this.
this is Vicodin. It's mine. You can't have any.
and, no, I do not have a pain management problem. I have a pain problem.
but who knows? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.
so, who wants me?
and who would rather wait for one of the other two guys?
okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room One if you change your mind.
Jodi Matthews?
please accompany Dr. House to Exam Room One.
Dr. Chase.
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend is the best medicine for him right now.
I know. I get stupid when I'm scared. Don't go rock climbing.
look, I was wondering. Before this happened, we were having sex.
[Sighs] What? You're wondering if whatever he has, you might've gotten it?
it-it's unlikely. We ran a complete S. T.D. Panel, so
no. I'm wondering if maybe I did this to him. I was kind of rough.
it was yellow. It was?
it's not anymore. Well, that's a shame.
I thought that might be a problem, so I brought you this.
your mucus was "pale goldenrod.
last week, yes. Should I be worried? Oh, yes. Very.
Really? I thought it was okay now.
and yet, here you are. What happened?
paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?
you're not a very nice doctor, are you?
and you are very bad at whatever it is you do.
you don't even know me. I know you're gonna get fired.
that's why you got the new glasses. That's why your teeth are sparkly white.
you're getting the most of your health insurance while you still can.
I might be quitting. [Zipper Zips]
if you were quitting, you'd have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod. You're getting fired.
I just don't like being told what to do.
I can get you in for a full body scan later this week.
Thanks.
it's got to be viral. We should start running gels and titers.
maybe we should look into the girlfriend's theory. She thinks she rode him to death.
[Chuckles] What'd you tell her?
I told her 22-year-old men don't die of sex.
What'd you ask her? - What do you mean?
I mean, I hope you got some specifics on exactly what was going on.
if the girl thinks it could kill you, it's worth knowing about.
have you ever taken a life?
we should stop the antibiotics.
it's too soon to say they're not having an effect.
they're having an effect.
his B. P. 's falling fast. There's fluid filling his lungs.
his creatinine is rising.
his kidneys are shutting down.
our treatment isn't making him better. It's killing him.
so, we had six symptoms that didn't add up to anything. Now we got seven. Who's excited?
I don't think it complicates things. The kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.
maybe. - Typically, low blood pressure and abdominal pain means an infection.
an abdominal infection causes sepsis, low blood pressure.
except we checked for abdominal infections.
but what if it's the other way around? What if the low blood pressure's causing the abdominal pain?
viral heart infection. The intestines aren't getting enough blood, and the result is belly pain.
I know it's not the standard presentation. - It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.
I thought that's what we dealt with here.
it explains the cardiomyopathy, the pain, the low B. P. the fever.
you read the book. Impressive.
it's a ludicrously long shot that explains every one of those symptoms- except for the cough and the rash.
should we just erase those? Well, anything can cause a rash.
okay. Cardiac infection.
cameron, you thought allergy. - Mm-hmm.
chase, what was it you thought? Carcinoid?
then there's hypothyroidism.
could be parasites.
finally, sinus infection.
if you're gonna list all the things it can't be, you're gonna need more colors.
cameron was right. No condition explains all these symptoms.
but orange and green covers everything. - Orange and green?
two conditions contracted simultaneously?
occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is always the best.
and you think one is simpler than two? - Pretty sure it is, yeah.
baby shows up. Chase tells you that two people exchanged fluids to create this being.
I tell you that one stork dropped the little tyke off in a diaper. Are you gonna go with the two or the one?
I think your argument is specious. - I think your tie is ugly.
why is one simpler than two? It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?
each one of these conditions is about a thousand-to-one shot.
that means that any two of them happening at the same time is a million-to-one shot.
chase says the cardiac infection is a 10 million-to-1 shot, which makes my idea 10 times better than yours.
get a calculator. Run the numbers.
we'll run the tests. Tests take time.
treatment's quicker. Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection, and... what was orange? [Cameron] Hypothyroidism.
my uncle has hypothyroidism. Not like this.
intravenous Levothyroxin is an artificial thyroid medication that should take care of it.
also, the nurses are going to start you on Unasyn. It's a more targeted antibiotic.
for the sinus infection? Yes.
the other stuff is for something else entirely. - Bad luck, huh?
don't worry. He should be back to ditching work in no time.
Brandon?
Hey, Mom. [Coughs]
we're his parents. How's he doing?
um, Brandon is
uh, Mom. Dad-[Clears Throat] This is Mindy.
I was gonna bring her home for Christmas. Um, we're engaged.
[Woman On P. A.] Dr. Hall to the recovery room. Dr. Hall
did you tell the family House's theory?
two odd conditions striking completely coincidentally at the exact same time?
I didn't phrase it quite that way. They agree to treatment?
of course they did. We're doctors. They believe whatever we tell them.
so, is that our job? House's puppets?
he comes up with an insane idea, we get to pretend it's not?
his insane ideas are usually right. We've been here long enough to
we've been here long enough to have Stockholm syndrome. [Laughs]
what, because we don't hate him? He thinks outside the box. Is that so evil?
he has no idea where the box is.
if you guys think he's right, go home. Relax. Just wait for the kid to get all better.
I'm going to the lab to test for viral infections.
negative for Coxsackie "B" virus.
seven down, about 5, 000 to go.
you really think we're gonna come up with your mystery virus just by running gels till we guess it right?
no. I think we're gonna do it by standing around watching other people work.
I'm waiting for the Epstein-Barr virus.
she's weird, isn't she? - Bad idea.
what? - Bad idea. You work with her.
what did I say?
is weird some new ghetto euphemism for sexy, like bad is good and phat is good?
then what the hell does "good" mean? - "Ghetto euphemism"?
[Scoffs] - You don't think she's hot?
no.
Wow. Then you're brilliant. And I am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.
obviously, the girl is hot. Y-You're not talking about her aesthetics.
you're talking about if I want to jump her. I don't.
brilliant.
[Machine Beeps] - Your Epstein-Barr is ready.
what are you doing? Level four.
no, no. I mean- I know what you meant. We're waiting.
my throat hurts. So you said.
how long are we waiting? Two minutes less than when you asked me two minutes ago.
Hi. - Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.
Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. His throat seems to have some condition.
say "Ah." Ah. [Mumbles]
he has a sore throat.
of course. Yes, why didn't l
I mean, because he said that it hurt, and I should have deduced that meant it was sore.
I was in a board meeting. Patients come first, right?
wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there's any doubt about its efficacy, huh?
you once asked me why I think I'm always right, and I realized that you're right.
at least, I think you're right. I don't really know, now do I?
Hey. I'm here. - Go home. Drink some hot tea.
[Exhales] Excellent counsel.
negative on parvovirus B-19.
I'm impressed. Thank you. I was born to run gels.
I meant about Chase. What about Chase?
well, the man has no physical interest in you.
he has a completely professional relationship with you, respects you as a colleague and a doctor.
and yet, he can't look at you without thinking sex.
because I asked what kind of sex could kill you?
you now have total control over your relationship with him.
so, a woman can't express her interest in sex without it being some professional power play?
no. If you look the way you do and you say what you said, you have to be aware of the effect that it's going to have on men.
men should grow up. - Yeah, and dogs should stop licking themselves.
it's not gonna happen. What's going on?
Yeah, what are you doing here? - Looking for you guys.
why didn't you page us? - 'Cause I knew you'd be here.
who told him? No one.
I assume you're trying to prove my crazy, two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you're gonna be in the lab.
you spin the urine? - Not yet.
talk to me when you have.
What'd you find out? Kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.
I wonder if that's significant. - It means the antibiotics didn't cause the kidney failure.
how'd you know?
if you guys hadn't been so busy trying to prove me wrong, you might've checked in on the poor kid.
you visited a patient?
I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he'd know someone was there for him.
I looked in on him. He's much better.
ergo, the treatment's working. Ergo, me right, you wrong.
Hey, I'm glad for the kid.
that smugness of yours really is an attractive quality. Thank you.
it was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.
I get that you're not a big believer in the "catching flies with honey" approach, but do you honestly think you'll collect a jarful by cleverly taunting them?
flies, no. Doctors, sure. If I'd said to Foreman, "Nice try. Great guess, but sorry, not this time," what do you think he'd be doing right now?
I think he'd go home not feeling like a piece of crap. Exactly.
you want him to feel like a piece of crap? No. I don't want him going home.
Dr. Foreman. [Coughs]
still have the cough. I'm feeling a lot better though.
his fever is gone. His rash is going away. [Chuckles]
I see. Is everything okay?
just ordering some tests. Absolutely nothing to worry about.
how much longer? - 9: 30. I figure she was on the eighth hole when I paged her.
you probably got another half hour.
I ran a T. S.H. T3 and T4. The patient's negative for hypothyroidism. I'm not talking about you.
the fact that he's getting better would indicate the unreliability of the tests.
if I'm right and it's a viral infection, one of two things always happen:
the patient dies, or the patient's immune system fights off the invader.
what's with her?
her leg hurts after running six miles. Who knows? Could be anything.
he's getting better. That doesn't prove you're right. That just proves he's getting better.
it-it's not two illnesses. It can't be two illnesses.
I am so glad you work here.
[Exhales] If I'm right, the antibiotics you prescribed...
could box his kidneys and liver, impeding his ability to fight off the virus.
it could kill him. - Well, that certainly would be a concern.
fifty bucks?
don't look away. The space monkeys will be all over you.
you wanna bet on the patient's health? - You think that's bad luck?
you think that God will smite him because of our insensitivity?
well, if God does, you make a quick 50.
Oh. - Go check his white blood count.
if he's fighting off a virus like you think, it'll be way up.
Hey. Cuddy said you needed a consult. What's up? I'm busy.
Oh!
I was just being glib. - You haven't said anything.
no. Before, when I was talking about Brandon's girlfriend thinking sex could kill you.
I was just making a joke because I was uncomfortable.
Oh, I don't even remember what you said. I'm uncomfortable about sex.
well, we don't have to talk about this. - Sex could kill you.
do you know what the human body goes through when you have sex?
pupils dilate. Arteries constrict.
core temperature rises, heart races, blood pressure skyrockets.
respiration becomes rapid and shallow.
the brain fires bursts of electrical impulses from nowhere to nowhere.
secretions spit out of every gland, and the muscles tense and spasm like you're lifting three times your body weight.
it's violent, it's ugly, and it's messy.
and if God hadn't made it unbelievably fun, the human race would've died out eons ago.
men are lucky they can only have one orgasm.
you know that women can have an hour-long orgasm?
Hey, Foreman. What's up?
Hey, Foreman. - Hey.
white cell count isn't up, is it? - No. We were both wrong.
white cell count is down- way down-and dropping.
his immune system is shot. We need to get him into a clean room.
[Chase] Can you walk, Brandon?
Yeah. A little.
okay. 'Cause we'll need to leave the chair outside. Thank you.
Where's April? April?
can you take that chair, please? Thank you. Yes, Robert.
I'll need to take your, um- your mask and your robe too.
you might wanna block your ears for this, it's quite loud.
something's made him immuno-compromised.
his white blood cell count is down, which means his body can't fight off infections.
if he gets sick, he'll die. Sick? How sick?
Lfhe gets a cold, he'll die.
okay. I'm gonna push the needle into your hip bone and take some of the marrow.
that's not so bad.
Uh-uh. That was just the anesthetic. [Instrument Clatters On Table]
the core biopsy needle, it's a bit bigger.
Hey, man. Take a deep breath. This-This is gonna hurt... a lot.
your marrow makes the blood cells.
we take a peek at it under a microscope, and maybe we find a viral infection.
maybe we find some fibrosis.
something to explain why your blood count is so low.
there we go.
one step closer to an answer.
[Shaky Breath] If you don't find one,
I can't stay here forever.
[House] The patient could've died. - The one with the pulled muscle?
those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions.
[Stammers] I'm entitled to a consult. - You are not getting out of clinic duty.
come on. You got a hundred other idiot doctors in this building who go...
all warm and fuzzy every time they pull a toy car out of a nose- you don't need me here.
no, I don't. But working with people actually makes you a better doctor.
when did I sign up for that course? When did I give you the impression that I care?
working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion.
I've got your home number, right? In case anything comes up at 3: 00 in the morning.
it's not gonna work. You know why?
because this is fun.
you think of something to make me miserable. I think of something to make you miserable
it's a game, and I'm gonna win because I got a head start. You are already miserable.
uh- Is this important?
uh, no. Good.
what's with you and her? Don't.
you have a thing for her? The only people who can get to you
no. There is not a thin line between love and hate.
there is, in fact, a Great Wall of China, with armed sentries posted every 20 feet between love and hate.
thirty-six Vicodin. Who's the patient?
I am. You can't
Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician. Yeah.
you will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want, but you're incapable of kissing a little ass?
[Pills Rattle] We all have our limitations.
house? Wrong bottle. Do me a favor.
take one of these, wait five minutes for it to kick in, then find Cuddy and kiss her ass.
what was the kid's first symptom?
you did the history. Of his 800 symptoms, which one hit him first?
uh, the cough.
gout.
um, are we talking about Brandon? Gout?
uric acid crystals in the joints?
the symptoms are pain, swelling, redness, stiffness. Not one of which do I see on that board.
because he doesn't have gout. [Makes Popping Sound]
every day, cells die.
we survive because the remaining cells divide and replace the losses.
the colchicine, a gout medicine, blocks mitosis and stops cell division, which will result in abdominal pain, rash, nausea, fever, kidney failure, low blood pressure...
and will also mess with the bone marrow.
but he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?
because you guys were right. He didn't have two conditions at the exact same time.
first, he got a cough. And because he's an idiot, he went to a doctor.
in order to justify charging $200, that doctor felt he should actually do something.
Oops. He wrote a prescription.
seven thousand people die each year from pharmacy screwups.
not nearly as many as die from doctor screwups, but still, not something they use in their promotional materials.
the pharmacist gave him gout medicine instead of cough medicine.
and the only thing it wouldn't do, it would do absolutely nothing to relieve his cough.
occam's Razor
the simplest explanation is almost always that somebody screwed up.
but once he checked into this hospital, he was completely in our control.
our food, our pills, our everything.
so even if you're right, no more gout medication.
he'd either continue to deteriorate, or he would've gotten better.
but he got better, and then he got worse.
it doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.
okay. Two people screwed up.
not as simple as one, but
he's resting. He's- I'm Dr. House.
I'm your son's physician. Oh. You're the one we haven't met yet.
you're the one he hasn't met. How can you treat someone without meeting them?
it's easy if you don't give a crap about him.
that's a good thing.
if emotions made you act rationally, well, they wouldn't be called emotions, right?
that's why we have this nice division of labor. You hold his hand, I get him better.
if I start tucking him in at night, well, that's not fair to you guys.
and if you start prescribing medicine, well, that's not fair to me.
so, what I wanna know is, who stepped on my side of the net?
who cared enough to get stupid enough to give him his cough medicine?
when we checked in, Dr. Foreman
tuesday, he's getting better. Wednesday, he's getting sick again.
somebody gave him his cough medicine Wednesday.
come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.
I just wanna know who tried to kill the kid.
Dr. House, maybe we should- - His throat was sore.
page Dr. Occam. He's gonna wanna hear about this. I'm sorry.
he was coughing, and I just wanted to help him- Aren't you a dear.
where are the pills? He took the last of'em before he was switched into that room.
they're all gone? It was just cough medicine.
no, it wasn't. Where's the bottle?
we need to know exactly what you put in this bottle.
we think it was colchicine, a gout medication.
if the prescription said cough medicine, that's what I dispensed.
the family is prepared to waive liability, all right?
we just need to know what it was, what dosage it was- It was cough medicine.
refill it.
he's gonna be okay. You don't know that.
does Brandon like that quality in you?
you're a little negative.
things don't always work out for the best. Doesn't hurt to hope they do.
no. Not unless that makes you figure you can do whatever you want, like give people cough medicine.
this is cough medication. This is what Brandon was supposed to get.
they're small, round and yellow.
can you tell this man what the pills in your son's medicine bottle actually looked like?
they were small, round and yellow, exactly like this.
those were the pills that Brandon was taking.
Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.
[House] It was so perfect. It was beautiful.
beauty often seduces us on the road to truth.
and triteness kicks us in the nads.
so true. This doesn't bother you?
that you were wrong? I try to work through the pain.
I was not wrong. Everything I said was true. It fit. It was elegant.
so, reality was wrong? - [Sighs] Reality's almost always wrong.
the cough medicine did something.
[Exhales] Aggravated the condition.
it's all over the place. Must be in his blood.
what if it is his blood? - Lymphoma?
unless you've got something better.
we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his C. T. Scan showed no adenopathy,
C. B.C. Showed a normal differen-smear, bone marrow showed no- Screw the tests.
do an exploratory laparotomy and find out what's in there.
he has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him.
Yeah, you're right. Let's stick with the wrong pill theory.
I'll schedule him for surgery.
[Foreman] Okay, Brandon, we're running this tube through your heart...
and into the pulmonary arteries in your lungs.
[Cameron] The sensors will give us information we need for the exploratory surgery later this afternoon.
my fingers are numb. - Try not to move.
we're in the right atrium, trying to catch the flow through the tricuspid valve.
[Chase] I think the catheter's curling in the atrium.
got it. We're in the R. V. Now.
[Beeps] Ectopy.
you must've irritated the heart wall. - It'll calm down.
he can't tolerate any cardiac arrhythmia. Pull back. - He needs the surgery.
[High-pitched Tone] - Pressure's dropped.
you still with us, Brandon? - Get the curtains.
V. F.
[Chase] Charging. Clear.
[Rhythmic Beeping] - [Exhales] Sinus rhythm.
I got a pulse.
Yeah, but no surgery today.
How're you doing? - Okay.
great. I'm doing good too.
I get to knock off an hour early today. You know why?
because I kissed my boss's ass. Do you ever do that?
I think she just said yes 'cause she wants to reinforce that behavior.
wants me to kiss a lot of other people's ass, like she wants me to kiss yours.
what would you want? A doctor who holds your hand while you die, or a doctor who ignores you while you get better?
I guess it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.
I should go. - You think it's gonna come out on its own?
are we talking bigger than a breadbasket?
because, actually, it will come out on its own.
which for small stuff is no problem. It's wrapped up in a nice, soft package, and plop.
big stuff, you're gonna rip something, which, speaking medically, is when the fun stops. How did you
you've been here half an hour, you haven't sat down. That tells me its location.
you haven't told me what it is. That tells me it's humiliating.
you have a little birdie carved on your arm. That tells me you have a high tolerance for humiliation.
so I figure it's not hemorrhoids.
I've been a doctor 20 years. You're not gonna surprise me.
[Exhales] It's an MP3 player.
Mm.
is it- Is it because of the size, or the shape, or is it the pounding bass line?
what are we gonna do?
I'm gonna wait. - For what?
okay. It's 3: 00. I'm off.
would you tell Dr. Cuddy there's a patient in Exam Room Two needs her attention?
and the R. I.A. A. Wants her to check for illegal downloads.
Brandon's not ready for surgery. Okay.
let's leave it a couple of weeks. He should be feeling better by then. Oh, wait. Which way does time go?
he crashed during prep. He's also experiencing pain in his fingers.
think some bug may have gotten in the clean room.
I think we should double his dosage of G-CSF to temporarily boost his white blood cell count.
pain in his fingers. Right.
hi again. He can't
Where's he going? [Hissing]
Hey. How you all doing?
interesting fact. Every seven years, it's a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?
Dr. House, this is a clean room. Yeah. I read the sign.
but cells of different organs reproduce at different rates.
[Groans] - So, you get a new kidney every three years.
get a new stomach lining every week.
this is why colchicine poisoning causes all these symptoms, but not all at once.
but we went to the pharmacy. We saw the pills.
colchicine does its damage in a very specific order.
first of all, there's the pain in the abdomen, the rash, the fever. Isn't that what you got first?
then the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to
Brandon. - Right.
then it screws up your bone marrow, and then neuropathy.
[Brandon Groans] A painful tingling in the fingers and toes.
and what do you suppose happens after that? [Grunts]
hair loss. The bad news is...
your special boy is doing drugs. [Mom] No, he's not.
ecstasy? No.
twice with Dan and Mike. - You know what they cut that stuff with?
apparently, colchicine. Unless you ingested the colchicine through your contact lens solution, or skin cream or some other drug you're lying about.
I don't know how it happened. I don't care how it happened. It happened. Start, uh
Brandon. - Lovely name.
start Brandon on FAB fragments, and get him some Tylenol for the hair I pulled out.
and get some air in here.
make a note. I should never doubt myself.
I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong every now and then.
what, you don't care about these people?
the colchicine interferes with the ability of the heart muscle to contract, pumping blood, lowering your blood pressure.
the antibodies we're giving you should neutralize the colchicine, allowing your heart to beat at its normal rate.
when will you know?
we know now.
thank God. [Laughs]
Mmm.
big weekend? It's not for me. I'm fully stocked.
Cuddy got you doing inventory? - Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.
the gout medicine O. D? Yeah.
the fact that I know it's a gout medicine O. D. Would indicate the case is already solved.
well, you'd be wrong.
what about the fact that the kid is now- I believe the technical term is- "not sick"?
you know how many forms of colchicine there are on the market?
stop it. - Neither do I. But it's a lot.
pills, powders, liquids, I. V. Fluids.
somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.
you're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?
he said he used it twice. - People lie.
if you're gonna lie, it's- - You know what? I'm not interested.
not curious? - No. Because I'm well-adjusted.
right.
temperature's normal. I want cousin Sharon there.
if we invite Sharon, we have to invite all the cousins.
so what? My side of the family doesn't need anything.
I don't suppose I could have some of those cough pills, huh? They're okay, right?
Yes. You're doing great. - You should invite Dr. House.
[Brandon] Will he come? - No. But he'll send a gift.
[Laughs] I'll make sure it's a good one.
there's a letter on the back of these pills.
your old pills didn't have a letter on them?
no. Round and yellow, but no letter.
well, these will help your cough.
Hey, you wanna go get some- No.
[Woman On P. A.] Radiologist, contact 5317.
radiologist, contact 5317.
[Man] Amber. [Woman] No.
why not? Amber's a stripper name.
find me one stripper named Amber Hartig.
or not. Okay.
Non-stripper names. Um, Desiree? [Coos]
Bambi? Kandy Kane?
Max.
Max Hartig. It's a cute name, isn't it?
if you're a professional boxer, maybe.
can you believe we made this little creature?
I know. It's incredible. It's the most amazing thing we've ever done.
I almost ran the marathon last year.
if we're lucky, you won't inherit your daddy's sense of humor.
hello. Say "hi" to Bear.
she hasn't even eaten anything. Why is she spitting up?
well, honey, we can't bug them again. Could you
okay, okay.
I'm sorry. It's our first kid. We're both a little panicky, I guess.
well, you gotta ask the pediatrician next time. I just deliver 'em.
is she spitting up? - Yeah. Second time in an hour.
Oh. If you lived underwater for nine months, you'd have a lot to spit up too.
is something wrong? A little lethargic.
[Mr. Hartig] Well, we didn't think- - She's hot.
[gasping] - Is she, uh
the baby's seizing! Get the crash cart!
what's-what's wrong? - Need some help in here!
Oh, God. Is she all right? [Alarm Beeping]
[Woman] I. V. Access? - No. Ativan.
what's going on?
[Sighs] The M. R.I.'s back.
And? It's what we expected.
the accident caused serious damage.
it's amnesia.
[Man On TV] I'm sorry.
[Woman On TV] I just can't believe it.
enjoying our lounge, House?
just came in to get milk for my coffee, which you're out of.
flat or sparkling? - Sparkling. - Splat.
so, the Hartigs?
their baby gets a fever. What, don't tell me- the kid had a seizure.
Yep. The parents, of course, start freaking, and I have to deal with that for an hour.
like it was your fault. She was perfect when I delivered her.
if you wanna blame someone, blame the pediatrician. So, how is the kid now?
bowel obstruction. She's under observation. She'll be fine.
the pediatrician will take all the credit.
[House] Exhibit A: Baby Girl Hartig.
term baby, 42 hours old.
went into seizures six hours ago, brought into the intensive care...
diagnosed with obstruction of the small bowel.
I'm still amazed you're actually in the same room with a patient.
people don't bug me until they get teeth.
exhibit B: Baby Boy Hausen.
another term baby, 48 hours old.
brought into the NICU three hours before the Hartig baby.
fever of unknown origin, 101 degrees, trending upwards.
wow, that is amazing.
you hung out in the OBGYN lounge all morning and heard about two sick babies.
it's- It's eerie. - Don't touch that.
all right. We have an infection spreading in the hospital.
[Scoffs] These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.
they fell sick within four hours of each other.
they had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission's possible.
they have the same symptoms. - The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction.
no matter how close their beds are, I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.
what does bowel obstruction on a chart indicate?
normally I'd say it indicates a patient's bowel is obstructed, but I'm pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart.
it means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the patient's bowel is obstructed.
okay, you're upset because they threw you out of their lounge. - Look at the X-ray.
it's a normal gas pattern. If you want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.
air in the colon. We're getting TiVo.
if it's air, no bowel obstruction.
even if it is air, it could have been there before the obstruction.
no. Something's infected both these infants.
and you're the only one who put this together because
because I'm the only one who looked at both kids.
I want them isolated. I want the maternity ward shut down.
because you're better at reading an X-ray than a radiologist.
radiologists always overread babies' X-rays, especially if they're asked to rule out a pathology.
he read into it what he wanted. - Which is exactly what you're doing.
you're finding a cluster because you think it's interesting to find a cluster.
two plain old sick babies would bore you.
see, this is why I don't waste money on shrinks, 'cause you give me all these really great insights for free.
shrink. If you would consider going to a shrink, I would pay for it myself.
the hospital would hold a bake sale, for God's sake.
we have an epidemic!
two sick babies is very sad, but it doesn't prove an epidemic.
how many do?
get up. We're going hunting.
for what?
wabbits.
Hi. Bye.
he's screaming. He's fine.
good-looking baby.
Oh, sorry. Wrong room. We'll see you later.
twelve rooms, right? That's it?
Yep. We've definitely checked the whole floor.
good news. No epidemic.
tragic, huh?
overflow rooms, third floor.
this imaginary infection has spread to the next floor?
we were just gonna call. Did he get hot all of a sudden?
Yeah.
[Babies Crying] [Man] Yeah, I'll take care of that for you.
[Man] Almost there, honey. Don't worry. We're almost there.
excuse me! Hi. Hi.
intake sent you up here? Yeah, my wife's contractions are less than
okay, Intake messed up. I am very, very sorry.
nurse Alpert will arrange for an ambulance...
to take you to Princeton General. [Panting]
the maternity ward is temporarily closed. We have to leave?
Yes. I am very sorry. Why are you doing this?
[Painful Grunting] You will be there very, very soon.
happy now? No.
but I am interested.
three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms.
how bad? - Spiking fevers.
B. P.'s plummeting. They're barely able to keep systolic up.
at this rate, they could be dead in a day. - Where did this come from?
two delivery rooms, four different maternity rooms. No common personnel and no common equipment.
there's got to be something in common. - Yeah.
that would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.
I'm putting a team together. We're gonna start swabbing.
what's she gonna swab? Every respirator, sink, vent, drain in the entire hospital?
that'll take months. - Needle in a haystack.
it's worse than that, We don't even know it's a needle we're looking for.
then why'd you let her go do it? - Because the hospital is her baby, and her baby's sick.
if she doesn't solve this soon, her head's gonna explode, and I don't want to get any on me.
so let's figure out what's in the haystack.
differential diagnosis, people. - Parasite.
it's spreading too quickly. - Next?
virus? - The kids are too sick, and the blood tests showed no lymphocytosis.
and they're not responding to acyclovir or ribavirin.
if it's some other virus, we'll never find it in time anyway.
which leads us to bacterial infection.
it's not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we've got something resistant.
the usual suspects? - MRSA. It's always MRSA in hospitals.
maybe contaminated food or water source.
Pseudomonas.
V. R.E? "H" flu.
okay. Those are the big ones.
cultures will take 48 hours. Might as well be postmortem.
we'll start them on vancomycin for the MRSA and aztreonam to cover the rest.
let's get M. R.I. 's, check for abscesses or some occult infection.
I'll be in the clinic. Grab me if you find something important... or unimportant.
[Cameron] We did an M. R.I. On all the babies, and, unfortunately, we didn't find anything, so we're starting them on the strongest antibiotics that we've got, and we're hoping that that will take care of it.
but he's so tiny.
how sick is he?
his fever's up to 103. 5, and his blood pressure is 80 over 40.
how, um- How bad is that?
uh
it-it's low. The heart needs to circulate the blood.
if it's weak, the oxygen isn't getting to the liver, the kidneys, the brain.
um, I have to ask you something.
Judy- No, no, Kim. Let me.
um, I had a cold last month, and I told the doctors about it.
honey, this has nothing to do with you.
kim's right.
your son was born healthy.
he caught the infection after his birth.
there's no reason to think that he caught it from you.
but you don't know. I mean, you don't know how he got sick.
pretty standard question- "How sick is my child?" You couldn't answer.
I answered. You rattled off numbers- B. P. O2 sats.
it's not what they need to know. What they need to know is the future. You got a Magic 8 ball?
no, just eight years of medical training.
look, I realize it's tough to break bad news to families.
not as tough as hearing it.
and I guess being the poor guy dying is the toughest of all?
no.
it's easier to die than to watch someone die.
[Cuddy] Well, we're checking the vents. It could be airborne.
somebody get the sinks, too, and underneath them.
I'll get it.
how many med students have you got swabbing the decks?
what else are they gonna do? It's not like they're delivering babies.
you find anything yet? Uh, yeah.
about half the antibacterial gel dispensers are empty or broken.
that's bad, yet diagnostically completely insignificant.
well, if the staff can't wash their hands, it's no wonder an infection has spread.
Hey! Tie clip! Sorry?
we have an epidemic in this hospital, and your tie is becoming a petri dish.
put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.
[Woman] Myjoints have been feeling all loose, and lately I've been feeling sick a lot.
maybe I'm over-training.
I'm doing the marathon, like, 10 miles a day, but I can't seem to lose any weight.
lift up your arms.
you have a parasite.
like a tapeworm or something? Lie back and lift up your sweater.
you can put your arms down.
can you do anything about it? Only for about a month or so.
after that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple states.
illegal? But don't worry.
many women learn to embrace this parasite.
they name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites.
Playdates? - It has your eyes.
but that's impossible.
well, I assume you weren't getting your period.
maybe that should have given you an inkling.
but I'm on this birth control implant. Yeah, I know.
I saw the scar on your arm. And my doctor said I might not get any periods at all if it was working.
Mm-hmm. Interestingly enough, you also don't get any periods if it isn't working, which is why you were supposed to get regular pregnancy tests.
Oh! I'm gonna send a nurse in here to schedule your prenatal care.
you're due in about five months, so start planning the shower.
um, Doctor?
please, me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon, but, oh, God, like four months ago, we had this really big fight.
he moved out. I did something stupid.
one-night stand? Ex-boyfriend.
well, I'll schedule you a paternity test too.
I can't let my husband know.
does the old boyfriend look like your husband?
Yeah.
then just have the kid. He'll never know.
the most successful marriages are based on lies.
you're off to a great start.
well, you look cheery. What's going on?
the Hartig and Chen-Lupino babies, their kidneys are shutting down.
and the urine tests show no casts.
which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.
you're the nephrologist. Which one did it? We'll take 'em off that one.
don't tell me both vancomycin and aztreonam. - They both can cause this.
there's no way to know which one it is. No test.
we can't take 'em off the antibiotics though. They'll die of the infection.
if we leave them on both the antibiotics, they'll die of kidney failure.
so, we take our best guess then. Which drug's causing the kidney failure?
it's like I said, it's always MRSA in hospitals. Take them off aztreonam.
I still think it's the pseudomonas. I vote to take them off the vancomycin.
there's no point in guessing.
take one kid off vancomycin, the other off aztreonam.
they have the same disease. You want to give them different treatments? - What the hell are you doing?
therapeutic trial, to find the cause of the infection. - That's wrong.
we have four sick kids at least.
who knows how many more haven't started showing symptoms yet? - We have a duty to these two.
if these two have different reactions, we'll know how to save the rest.
so you're condemning one of these kids to die based on random chance?
I guess I am.
[Cuddy] So you're going to flip a coin?
that's how you decide which baby lives?
can I borrow a quarter?
do you want to get sued, lose your license, House?
well, generally I'd applaud that, but my job is to protect this hospital, so I strongly advise you to come up with a medical rationale...
why baby '"A"should get medicine "X" and vice versa.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there, slick. We didn't all go to law school.
your advice is that I should use medical reasons to make medical decisions? Hmm, that's not gonna be as easy.
any medical justification. It doesn't need to be a good one.
well, "Hartig" sounds Jewish, so does aztreonam, so we'll take the Hartig kid off vancomycin.
how's that?
you can't experiment on babies. - Doctors experiment all the time.
on adults, with their consent. - Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.
their informed consent. They have to know the other kid is getting a different treatment.
sorry. Can't do that. It would be unethical for one patient to know about another patient's treatment.
they have a right to know. - If they know, they won't consent. That defeats the whole purpose.
that's their right.
two more babies have just become symptomatic.
I defer to your legal wisdom.
which takes precedence- six dying babies or a missing consent form?
you can't do it.
do what you think is best.
your daughter's kidneys are shutting down.
your son's kidneys are failing.
so we're going to take her off the aztreonam.
we're taking him off vancomycin.
uh, but what- what made her sick in the first place?
what do you think is causing it? - It seems to be a germ called pseudomonas.
we think it's MRSA- Methicillin-resistant staph aureus.
it's a very resistant form of a very common bacteria.
we're hoping the aztreonam will clear it up.
vancomycin is the best treatment for MRSA, so we're gonna keep giving it to her.
is it gonna cure her?
your child is very sick. You need to know that.
this is a Hail Mary pass. It might cure her. It might not.
so-so, that'll cure him?
we'll know in 24 hours if it's working.
what did you tell them? I told them the truth.
they seemed relieved. Did you tell them how sick their son is?
I explained what was going on. Allison, their baby's dying.
if the parents weren't in tears by the time you left, you didn't tell them the truth.
that's not how I see it. Do you want them blindsided?
want them coming up and saying, "My God, my baby died. Why didn't you warn me?
so now it's about worrying about them yelling at us? No.
it's about getting them prepared for the likely death of their child.
if their son dies tomorrow, you think they'll give a damn what I said to them today?
it's not gonna matter. They're not gonna care. Nothing's gonna be the same ever again.
just give those poor women a few hours of hope.
Dr. House! Oh, no.
Dr. House, this is my husband, Charlie.
who told you where my office was?
Jill, come on. He obviously doesn't want us bothering him.
Ooh, I was trying to hide it.
look, Doctor, this is about the mono that you said you thought I had.
the mono? Yes.
you know, shouldn't Charlie be tested?
you know, the test. The blood test.
right.
Yeah, I'm sorry. L- I sometimes forget patients.
I thought you were this idiot who doesn't know how to use birth control.
I can't have mono. I don't even feel sick or anything.
that's very often the first sign.
call my office in the morning, and I'll schedule you for blood tests.
thank you.
I'm not even tired. Oh.
find anything yet?
Oh, just some baby formula being stored under a sink with a dripping faucet.
tap water contamination. You thinking pseudomonas infection?
I was. I wasted a couple of hours chasing it down.
but, of course, the formula hasn't been anywhere near the babies.
huh. Whatever idiot stored them there
all right, we'll figure it out. Just-Just calm down.
I am calm. Let me know when you're gonna need it.
Oh, come- I warned you.
I did that calmly.
Hey. Hi.
she any better?
uh, her fever has been stable the last hour.
we're not gonna make it, are we?
sorry?
me and Ethan.
our next-door neighbor, her little boy died in a car crash, and she and her husband split up, like, four months after the funeral.
it's just, uh, what always happens, right?
uh, what happens to patients after they leave the hospital, I don't know, but try not to get ahead of yourself.
[Nurse] Dr. Chase, activity on the monitor.
how long? I don't know. It just started.
pulse? Fluid, wide open.
do we have an arterial line? Not yet.
let's get a B. P.
you can't come in here. Is my baby dying?
Mrs. Hartig- - Is she dying? - Ma'am, you'll have to leave.
it's not your baby.
ventilate.
B. P. 60 over 20.
heart rate's 180. Start the levophed.
[Fast Beeping] Still dropping.
I can't hold B. P. even with three pressors.
I'm losing pulse. [Monitors Beeping]
v-fib.
shut the blinds.
charging. Set.
clear.
still V-fib.
charging. Clear.
charging. Clear.
[Foreman] Still V-fib.
charging. Clear.
charging. - Chase.
time of death- 6: 57 p. m.
[House] The aztreonam doesn't work.
double-cover all the other babies with vancomycin.
I'll do it.
[House] Cameron, tell the parents.
tell them their child probably saved five lives.
but Chase should- - Chase is busy.
you're the attending.
make sure she does her job.
I asked you to make sure she does her job, not do it for her.
she froze up. She felt sorry for the parents, so she shut up.
you felt sorry for her, so you opened your mouth. She has a problem.
she needs to deal with it. If you hadn't bailed her out, she would have done it.
great. Then she wouldn't have slept for two weeks.
maybe she should be thinking about a different specialty.
lab work? Research?
Yeah, what is it? - The Hartig baby- she's getting sicker too.
the vancomycin isn't working either.
vancomycin doesn't kill it. Aztreonam doesn't kill it.
what the hell is this?
it's a superbug. It could be V. R.S. A.
there's only been two reported cases ever in the United States.
one of the kids, the Hausen baby, had a skin rash.
it could be scalded-skin syndrome, which would be a sign of V. R.S. A. Then these kids are dead.
this is our fault.
doctors overprescribing antibiotics.
got a cold? Take some penicillin.
sniffles? No problem. Have some azithromycin.
is that not working anymore? Well, got your levaquin.
antibacterial soaps in every bathroom.
they'll be adding vancomycin to the water supply soon.
we bred these superbugs.
they're our babies, and they're all grown up, and they've got body piercings and a lot of anger.
on the other hand, maybe antibiotics had nothing to do with it.
did you notice how low his B. P. Was at the end, even with three pressors?
heart damage?
go home. There's nothing more you can do tonight.
baby Boy Chen-Lupino.
time of death- 6: 57 p. m. Thursday, December 2, 2004.
this is a cross section of the Chen-Lupino boy's myocardium.
fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates.
there was no sign of lymphocytosis in the blood tests.
Yes, well, we all had plenty of good reasons to think bacterial.
nobody is scolding you.
unfortunately, all those clever reasons were wrong.
it is a virus infecting their hearts.
then we're screwed. We can't chase down a virus.
there's a thousand possibilities. We could run gels, antibody tests.
[Foreman] A thousand of them? The kids don't have enough blood.
chase, you're the intensivist. How many could we do before we risk exsanguinating the kids?
you're talking vials, not stick tests? I wouldn't take more than five or six.
okay, so we have to narrow the thousand viruses down to six.
now, the autopsy's shown us what the virus does.
so, let's go. What do we know?
that ribavirin and acyclovir don't knock it out.
cross out the herpes viruses. - Also adenovirus.
what else? What else? Keep talking!
well, i-it only seems to hit children.
the mothers aren't sick, so- - [Foreman] No toxoplasmosis, no rubella.
cross out the entire TORCH syndrome.
you didn't find any lung damage? - No.
none of the paramyxoviridae. - Cardiac scarring, people.
C. M.V.
enteroviruses too, I think.
[House] Eleven. Influenza A.
flu A.
yes?
And?
I'm putting R. S.V. Down as a yes.
that makes eight.
eight vials of blood is pushing it. - Pushing it? Well, we love that.
get the antibody kits, start testing the sick kids.
all right, I'll look into whether there are any antivirals for these eight.
wait a second. The kids on the floor who didn't get sick- are any of them still in the hospital?
they got moved to the fifth floor, but they're probably all checked out by now.
no, the Limpert boy had a bit of jaundice. He's checking out today.
I want to test his blood too. Why?
because we need all the information we can get.
the healthy kid can be our control group.
I'll just tell his parents he can't check out because he has the smallpox.
[Woman On P. A.] Stephen Morgan, contact Hospital Administration.
[Woman On P. A.] Dr. Paul to the Recovery Room.
all done. All done.
what did we get?
well, the sick babies all tested positive for echovirus 11.
great. And C. M.V. and parvovirus B-19.
three viruses? - But what's weirder, the healthy kid we tested, he's positive for echovirus 11 and C. M. V. Antibodies as well.
they're infants.
they have their mother's blood, their mother's antibodies.
so we've just learned nothing? Uh-uh.
we have half the picture. The healthy kids survived because their mothers' antibodies saved them.
if the mom had C. M.V. In the past, she'd have the antibodies for C. M.V. The kid would be immune from it.
so, we test the sick kids' moms for echovirus, C. M.V. And parvovirus.
and whichever they don't have the antibodies for, that's what's killing their kids.
I'll test the mothers.
[Woman On P. A.] Dr. Kent's office, one. Dr. Kent's office, one.
[Foreman] Echovirus 11.
it's an enterovirus. It lodges in the intestinal tract.
enteroviruses cause diarrhea and flu-like symptoms in adults, maybe a rash, but for newborns, it can be deadly.
it's damaging her heart.
well, is there anything you can do?
viruses are more difficult to treat than bacterial infections.
we still haven't found a cure for the common cold.
so, you mean there's no vaccine or
there's a company in Pennsylvania developing an antiviral.
it got positive results in a lab setting.
we managed to get our hands on it.
imagine not being able to touch your own baby.
can I get your guys' help with something? Sure.
your daughter, her- Maxine.
that's her name- Maxine.
we need someone to hold Maxine up off the bed while the nurse changes her sheet.
sure. Okay.
[crying] Shh, shh, shh.
look at you. Hi.
hold still.
[Crying Continues] That's it.
Hi. Easy. Shh.
there you go.
Hey, Foreman.
got a minute?
so, pulmonary resistance has stabilized for the two kids, but, uh, B. P.'s still
no news then. How's Cameron?
Dr. Cameron? Sure.
let's start with her and then move on to all the other Camerons we know.
I'm sorry. I'm just not used to you asking about someone's well-being.
I can understand how the question would surprise you.
I don't quite get how it would confuse you. [Elevator Bell Dings]
why do you wanna know? Why do you wanna know why I want to know?
just curious. Me too.
you don't get curious.
I'm the most curious man in the world. Not about trivialities.
well, then this must not be trivial.
how is Cameron handling everything?
just fine.
great. Glad we talked.
your husband is definitely the source of your mono.
Oh. Wow!
Oh, thank God.
Wow. I'm gonna be a mom.
Whoa! [Chuckling]
thank you so much. I gotta get you a gift or something.
sometimes the best gift is the gift of never seeing you again.
okay. All right.
but, Dr. House, you've been so awesome.
I mean, I really totally trust you.
do you think you- No.
could do the prenatal- No.
or deliver the baby? That would be "no.
okay.
Wow.
chase, take a look at this.
Oh, God. It's good news.
no. It's great.
[Chuckles] Thank you.
Hi. She's doing great.
Hi, little girl.
hello.
they all gone? Hartigs are checking out right now.
you look tired. Thanks.
it's no wonder. You've had a hard time the last couple of days.
and you haven't?
not like you.
anyone who's that awkward...
either has no experience with death or too much, and I'm pretty sure it's not the former.
chase told me about that idea you had, the parents holding the baby.
Where'd you get that?
did you lose someone?
did you lose a baby?
you can be a real bastard.
unfinished business?
I'm in the haystack.
Ah, because now you know you're looking for a needle.
right.
if I tell you to let it go, it won't make any difference, will it?
enteroviruses are spread by humans.
fecal or oral usually.
it could be respiratory secretions though.
so Cuddy got stool samples from the whole staff. Just wait till they come back.
that won't do it. Why not?
the shedder, whoever he is, he's so virulent, he must have been symptomatic.
Cuddy would have noticed him. Hmm.
and the babies didn't share any common personnel.
that's what's weird. - Yeah, yeah. That's what's weird.
[Woman On P. A.] Transition Team to O. R. 2.
transition Team to O. R. 2.
can I help you?
you saved my life. I just ran some tests.
your will and determination are what saved your life.
I know who I am now. Yes, you do.
and I know who I am as well.
Naomi, I love you.
Hey, seriously, man. You're not supposed to be here.
I'm performing a delivery. You are?
a patient whose prenatal care I've been handling.
I just took her on a couple of minutes ago.
of course, I'll need one of you two guys to supervise.
when's she due? Late March.
that's five months from now.
thank God these chairs are comfortable.
[Applauding] [Man] And the only thing wrong
the only thing wrong with the American dream...
is people- too many people.
too many of us telling young people that the dream is dead.
they told me that when I was growing up in the slums ofTrenton.
[Audience Grumbling] And they were wrong.
they told me that when I decided to run for senator, with only $58 in my savings account.
and they were wrong.
and they are still telling me that now- that I don't have a chance because I'm black, because I don't have the right nose, because I still only have $58 in my savings account.
with your help, we can keep that dream alive.
and in closing, just...
let me say
let me say that you should all donate the legal maximum...
to the next president of the United States.
are you okay? Do you need some water or something? No. I'm fine. I'm fine, really.
handsome guy like you, I bet you get 70% of the women.
well, here's hoping.
of course, it helps your wife died of cancer.
I mean, I'm sorry, but the sympathy vote's in your pocket.
Yeah, I appreciate your support.
[echoing] Listen, Senator, my union has a hell of a war chest.
um, I've always been strong on the union.
the thing is, you always go on in your speeches about the workers...
in Indonesia, Cambodia, Timbuktu.
because I think we have a- a moral
my union members are hurting.
they don't care about moral this and moral that. Are you all right?
senator? - Ugh. Hey!
the guys are gonna love that.
[Man] Everyone, give him some room. Give him room to breathe!
back off, please! Senator, are you all right?
[Vogler] The senator's suffering from nausea, headache and mental confusion.
Ah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose.
you're being childish.
look, ifhis case is as trivial as you think, it'll take you three minutes to diagnose.
Uh-huh. Three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages.
you're mad at me. - Nope.
I never liked Cameron or Foreman.
you know why I'm forcing you to fire one of them? Because you need to prove to me that you're a team player.
now, if you did that, you wouldn't need to go through this exercise.
fine. I'll hold the senator's hair while he upchucks.
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference, um, next week.
I don't do speeches. I'm shy.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has developed a new ACE inhibitor.
I would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals?
wait a second? Don't I own that company?
Oh, no, that's right. You do.
Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version.
it's all there in the study.
I know its price tag is significantly improved.
[Sighs] You can either give one 10-minute talk and one three-minute diagnosis, or you can fire one of your pets.
my understanding was that you believed in rationality above all else.
[Senator] I appreciate your keeping the media away.
we're keeping your staff away as well. Take it easy now.
I'm in the middle of a campaign. - The faster we can get you better, the faster you can get out of here.
anyone else at the fund-raiser get sick?
I don't think so, and I don't think that's it. I've been under the weather for weeks.
lots of traveling. I'm supposed to be in the Sudan next week.
[Electronic Beeping] - Oh!
helps me concentrate.
[Bottle Lid Pops] - Even better than drugs.
open your mouth, please.
Ahh.
that's quite a scar.
when I was six, I fell off the swing and bit my tongue.
couldn't talk right for the longest time. [Chuckling]
lots of teasing. It just made me fight harder, speak up for those who can't.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story.
in a tight race, the lispers alone could put you over the top.
you a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?
I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.
you find sincerity annoying?
you're a black kid from the ghetto...
who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate.
that's a sufficiently mythical story. You don't need to lie about your tongue.
must've missed it.
what's wrong?
what is it? It's not the food. It's your brain.
get an M. R.I. And a lumbar puncture.
cancel your travel plans.
the senator's L. P. Showed no sign of infection, and the M. R.I. Looks fairly clean.
I guess we can tell him he's fairly healthy and can go home.
well, there is something in Broca's area, but it's small, low intensity.
most likely just background noise. Care to bet your job on that?
what was that? What was what?
you got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.
I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.
last week you didn't get annoyed. You made poopie in your pants. It's weird.
it's almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about.
chase has nothing to worry about?
none of you has anything to worry about.
what happened?
Vogler saw the error of his ways and repented.
the lesion could be nothing. Also could be a brain tumor or an infection.
there's only one way to find out which.
you want to cut into his brain?
dangerous, I know. Especially since he's a politician, his brain's all twisted.
but I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call Surgery. Get it scheduled.
you're not pregnant. - Well, I told you that.
there's got to be some other reason I'm still spotting.
sure. You were pregnant.
based on your hormone levels, you've had a miscarriage.
I haven't even been on a date.
right. And since it's physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner
I haven't had sex since I split up with my husband.
that was almost a year ago. - Fine. Have it your way.
immaculate conception.
um, what do I do? - Well, it's obvious.
start a religion.
in my office.
afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood.
you're not doing a brain biopsy based on a spot on an M. R.I.
[Throws File Down] Where'd you get that?
not on a United States senator.
Oh, just so I'm clear- If he was a janitor, that would be okay? Do you have a list?
a brain biopsy can cause permanent neurological damage.
Uh-huh. Whereas tumors are really good for brains. Make 'em grow big and strong.
it's my call. - No, it's not.
you're pulling rank on patient care? - It's not my call either.
it's up to you. - Either it's a tumor or it's an infection that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up.
either way, unless we treat it immediately, it could kill you.
or it could be nothing. Reading brain M. R.I.'s is not an exact science.
well, what caused my s-symptoms?
Wow! Excellent question. Many doctors wouldn't have gone there.
it could be a transient ischemic attack.
you could make the argument for watching carefully for the time being.
hmm, but you'd only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your ass.
that's absurd and insulting. Insulting, yes.
what would the voters think?
if they find out I've had a b-brain biopsy?
this could leave you b-b-b-brain damaged, and you're worried about NASCAR dads?
it's not a brain tumor.
it's not a bacterial infection either.
so you biopsied his brain for nothing?
if that were true, would Dr. Wilson's mouth be contorted into that ugly shape?
it's toxoplasmosis.
you sure?
which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown Al DS.
they're gonna love that in Dubuque.
toxoplasmosis is a fairly common fungus you can get...
from eating under-cooked meat or touching cat feces.
in rare cases, the fungi travel up the bloodstream and latch onto the brain, causing a lesion or inflammation.
so, what's the prognosis?
toxo usually responds to treatment, but it only causes a lesion in your brain if your immune system is extremely weak to begin with.
senator, I'm afraid you have Al DS.
[Scoffs] - As I'm sure
No! As I'm sure you know, people with H. I.V. Can live a long time.
what else could do this to me? - Theoretically, certain cancers.
if you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS.
I do not have Al DS.
I don't sh- sh- shoot up drugs.
I don't s-sleep with
this is very bad news. I get that, and I sympathize.
but we gotta speed through the denial phase because you need antiretrovirals and you need them fast.
But-You haven't even tested me for H. I.V!
we will. - But the toxo drugs are gonna piss off your fungi.
and when fungi get pissed
[Clattering] - I am not going to take the pills.
you're afraid word will leak out.
trust me. You're not gonna be president either way.
they don't call it the White House because of the paint job.
here's what you're gonna do.
you're gonna give me the drugs for the toxo only.
you're going to test me for H. I.V. under a false name.
you are going to test me for cancer...
and anything else that could have done this to me.
if I have cancer, I will deal with it.
but I do not...
have Al DS.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals are pleased to announce...
that Dr. Gregory House will present the latest research on our exciting new ACE inhibitor.
[Scoffs] You're making that up. That's Vogler's company.
press release. "During an address at the North American Cardiology Conference."
house never gives speeches. - But when I really believe in something
gosh dang it, I got a chance to make a difference here.
you made a deal with Vogler?
it's all the rage. Everybody's doing it.
so, what's the deal? You get to keep all of us if you flog his products?
one speech. No biggie.
Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer.
cancer? The senator's got Al DS.
cancer sounds better in a press release.
I need you guys to rush the ELISA test for H. I.V.
thank you.
for the speech.
when I said "rush," I meant, you know, fast.
stat's the word you doctors use, right? - I know it's hard for you.
double stat?
[Moans Quietly] This may sting a little.
sorry. [Coughs] It wasn't the shot.
it's, um- My head's killing me.
senator, we don't have to do this now.
we can hold off till your H. I.V. Test comes back. [Laughing]
because you figure it's gonna come back positive.
in my experience- Patients lie.
politicians lie more. Black politicians
Oh. I don't think black politicians lie more than white politicians.
we lie less. - You figure we're morally superior?
[Chuckling] I've got my theories.
no, we- we just can't get away with it.
no one's gonna g-give us the benefit of the doubt.
no one's gonna cut us a second chance.
and when it happens, it's not just a- a bad politician.
it's- It's a bad role model.
it's a- a dis
discredit to the race.
you ready? Yeah.
Yeah.
take a deep breath. [Grunts]
Dr. House, I just wanted
you're welcome again. I want you to know how much
got it. You're grateful.
apparently you seem to think it will mean a lot to me to know that.
do you know why people pray to God?
I thought you didn't believe in God. I don't.
well, then you better be making a very good point.
do you think they pray to him and praise him because they want him to know how great he is?
God already knows that.
are you comparing me to God?
I thank you because it means something to me...
to be grateful for what I receive.
you are the most naive atheist I've ever met.
Dr. House, you have a patient in room one.
thank God.
people pray so that God won't crush them like bugs.
I'm not gonna crush you.
Petechial， bruising? I don't know if I pronounced that right.
gosh, the Internet is such a wonderful tool.
it could be leukemia. Definitely possible.
the more likely diagnosis is hickey.
well, it can't be a hickey.
why is everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?
I'm not having sex.
I've barely even thought about sex since my marriage. Ow!
I say you're having sex, you say you're not.
either you're lying or I'm wrong.
or there's some middle ground. - You mean, like, oral?
I mean, you're having sex without knowing it.
I'm testing you for booze, drugs and G. H.B.
I don't drink or-What's G. H.B?
the date-rape drug.
it's positive.
your "T" cell count is eight, which means there's a good chance you'll die.
I'm telling you this because we need to contact your sexual partners.
I've only had two girlfriends.
two. After my wife died.
I used c-condoms.
you know the chances of you getting H. I. V. From heterosexual sex with a condom?
Yes.
someday there will be a black president.
someday there will be a gay president.
maybe there'll even be a gay, black president.
but one combination I do not see happening is gay, black and dead.
you need to stop lying to me.
it must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.
cut the crap. You're dying.
and you're clever, you're witty and you are a coward.
you're scared of taking chances.
I take chances all the time. It's one of my worst qualities. - On people?
wanting to believe the best about people doesn't make it true.
being afraid to believe it doesn't make it false.
well, that's very moving. It's a shame I don't vote. Hmm.
this is who I am. I believe in people.
I'm not hiply cynical, and I don't make easy, snide remarks.
I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again.
I need to draw some more blood.
nurse!
the antiretrovirals aren't working.
that's not surprising.
he's just gonna keep getting worse. You realize that, right?
why are you spying on my case?
why are you giving that speech next week?
we're both just doing what we have to do. You don't see a problem with that?
checking in on a patient?
Yeah, wow. How do I look myself in the mirror?
you're not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.
it's a 10-minute speech. That I've been ordered to give.
Vogler's drug works. Don't care.
Uh-uh. No pills.
what's going on?
the antiretrovirals aren't working.
why not?
because you don't have Al DS.
the first test was a false positive.
happens one time in every 5, 000.
you r-ran a second test?
Yeah. - Yeah.
you're still dying.
the only difference is, now we don't know why.
he's continuing to lose control of the muscles on his right side.
his brain is getting foggier, and his "T" cells are still in single digits. - Why are we doing this here?
so Cuddy can't find us.
unless we figure out the underlying disease, this guy's lied to his last constituent.
false negative on the P. C.R. Al DS test? - Ran it twice.
immunoglobulin deficiency? - No history of respiratory problems.
idiopathic "T" cell deficiency.
Idiopathic- from the Latin meaning "we're idiots" 'cause we can't figure out what's causing it.
[Sighs] Give him a whole body scan.
you hate whole body scans. - 'Cause they're useless.
could probably scan any one of us and find five different doodads that look like cancer.
but when you're fourth down and a hundred to go, in the snow, you don't call a running play up the middle, unless you're theJets.
I hate sports metaphors.
why did you order the second AIDS test?
standard procedure. Oh, well, that's you- Mr. Standard Procedure.
you suspected the first test was a false positive?
I knew he was going to Africa, and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep "A" and "B.
that could cause a false positive.
you knew that before you ordered the first test. What changed? - I should have ordered both.
you were sure he had Al DS.
then you talked to him, then you had doubts. What did he say?
he said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.
huh. And you believed him.
he didn't have any reason to lie.
everybody lies, except politicians?
house, I believe you're a romantic.
you didn't just believe him, you believed in him!
do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry?
Dr. Cameron's getting to you.
well, I guess you can't be around that much niceness and not get any on you.
is that why you haven't put the moves on her?
what makes you think I haven't put the moves on her?
Oh! Oh, boy! You're in trouble.
you have restored my faith in the human race.
you're lying. - No. I'm not lying.
just got your results back. No G. H.B. no nothing.
it means you're having sex and you're lying about it.
no. And I have a new symptom.
I have a rash on my butt. [Chuckles]
do you wanna? Yeah.
what is it? - It's a carpet burn.
no. It can't be.
doctor, I love sex.
I miss it. I haven't had any in over a year.
well, you managed to keep this appointment, so you have no short-term memory problem.
multiple personalities? Do you find yourself losing chunks of time?
do you wake up, and you don't remember falling asleep? No. I just wake up really exhausted.
something upsetting you? - No.
my ex lives in the apartment downstairs.
he's always calling me, always wanting to get back together, complaining about mixed signals.
get out of my life. How much clearer can you get?
we have a sleep lab in the basement.
if nothing else, it will get you away from your ex for a night.
slightly enlarged lymph node in his left armpit.
how slightly? Quarter mil.
lymphoma? - [House] Sure.
or he's had a cold in the last six months.
what, you got her on speed dial? - I just follow the scent of arrogance.
another slightly enlarged node over here. Two more in his neck and one in his groin.
and there's a cyst in his liver. - [Cameron] It looks complex. Central necrosis?
[House] Spontaneous bleeding. It's benign.
I was rooting for a really cool tumor. Instead we're stuck with this crap.
doesn't matter. Once you find 'em, you gotta check 'em.
knock yourselves out.
I just saw Senator Wright. He looks like hell.
that sushi must've been a lot worse than you thought.
Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan?
a man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year.
here's a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.
[House] Fourteen pages.
the audience will be comatose by paragraph two.
throw in a joke.
Dr. Chase, we need to talk.
how do you see this ending? - What ending?
I can't fire you, so you have no reason to fear me and, therefore, no reason to lie to me.
you told Cuddy where I was. You told Vogler what I was doing.
Yeah. So how can I work with you?
well, you don't have a choice.
[Foreman] This might hurt a little.
lie to me. - [Chuckles]
okay. It'll feel like a gentle massage.
is a lousy teacher.
you can't lie for beans.
have you ever told any really big ones?
I might be messed up, but I'm not that out of it.
[grunting] - [Foreman] Strap his arm down.
am I going to be okay?
I hope so.
I am selling my soul.
just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.
I said I was selling it. Didn't say I was giving it away.
that would be immoral and stupid.
all they've done is add an antacid.
does it work? That's not the point.
of course it's the point. He's not asking you to lie.
he's not asking you to do something illegal. He's not asking me to do anything.
he's not ordering you. He gave you a choice. You chose your staff.
I know this isn't easy for you. You'll suffer.
vicodin sales in Jersey will triple.
but you are doing a good thing.
only you could feel like crap about doing something good.
kidney and liver cysts are both benign, and the lymph nodes all came back clean.
his left armpit node has antibodies for C. D. 11. - Not enough to indicate lymphoma.
we never tested for hairy cell leukemia.
no, but we would have picked it up somewhere else besides one lymph node.
and his spleen isn't enlarged. - Size isn't everything.
the spleen is the mother lode for hairy cells.
[Sighs] Let's cut it open.
you can't biopsy his spleen. It'll bleed like stink.
in the senator's condition, a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him.
why do you do this to me?
now if I kill him, I can't tell the judge I had no idea of the risks involved.
his brain is turning into mush, and he's at risk for more infections. We have to do it.
see? That'll sound much better in court.
okay. Go tell our human pincushion we'll be sticking him one more time.
don't you hate doing this?
Yeah.
what's up?
you like me.
Why?
that's kind of a sad question.
I'm just trying to figure out what makes you tick.
I am not warm and fuzzy, and you are basically a stuffed animal made by Grandma.
I don't think that's why you're asking.
I think this is because of the speech. - God, don't try and pick me apart.
then why are you asking?
what do you want to hear?
Hey, Senator. We need to do one more biopsy- on your spleen.
[Clears Throat] I'll have to sign lefty.
my fingers aren't working.
have you been coughing a lot?
[Gasps] Does it hurt?
it's like I can't get air.
is that from the toxo?
no. This is-This is new.
you don't need to sign. We can't do the biopsy.
the senator's breathing is severely impaired.
his O2 sat levels are at 89.
his silver stain indicates Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
another killer fungus. It's consistent with hairy cell leukemia.
[Foreman] But we can't biopsy his spleen. Respiratory distress.
his platelets are 20 and dropping. His blood won't clot worth a damn.
[Cameron] There's gotta be another way to diagnose hairy cell.
no. His bone marrow's indeterminate. Spleen biopsy's the only way to go.
you know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don't look for fish.
why, Dr. House?
they look for the blue heron because there's no way to see the fish.
but if there's fish, there's gonna be birds fishing.
now, if he's got hairy cell, what else should we see circling overhead?
he should have all sorts of weird viruses. - H. T.L. V. And A. T.L. V.
we can test for them. Run the titers.
these were your brain waves at 2: 45 a. m.
now, here it comes. There's an abruptjump from slow-wave sleep.
this indicates partial sleep arousal.
most common type is somnambulism. Sleepwalking.
that would explain why I'm so tired when I wake up.
Yes. And also why you were pregnant.
and the hickeys. And the carpet burn.
I had sex in my sleep?
Sexsomnia is a documented disorder.
you said your ex lives downstairs. I'll kill him.
okay. But he probably didn't know that you were asleep.
Sexsomniacs can act pretty normal.
I'm gonna write you a prescription for a low-dose antidepressant.
it'll let you sleep better.
if you wanna save yourself the $15 co-pay, you could have sex while you're awake.
he's my ex. I don't- - You live in the same building.
you haven't had sex with anyone else for a year. You sleepwalk right into his arms.
call me crazy, but I'm sensing unresolved issues.
negative for H. T.L. V. 1 and 2.
and negative for A. T.L. V. And everything else.
it's not hairy cell.
Hey. You really gonna give that speech?
you got an opinion too? I'm a little surprised.
frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.
you're welcome. He's positive for Epstein-Barr.
so what?
it doesn't point to hairy cell. It's irrelevant.
[gasping] Hey.
you didn't fall off the swings when you were eight.
[Gasping Continues] S-S-Six.
ever.
give that back. Uh-uh. We have to talk.
you had an epileptic seizure.
that's how you bit your tongue.
l-I haven't had a seizure since
what medication did you take?
no s-s-seizure since I was six.
no dr-dr-drugs s-since I was 10.
Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about what the question is.
don't worry that you're starting to feel dizzy. Just stay on message.
my- [Sobbing]
my mother used to call it- [Gasping]
Funny-something.
Phenytoin? - Yes!
okay, okay. You're okay.
it's okay. [Whimpering]
everybody lies.
[House] Senator Gary H. Wright of NewJersey had childhood epilepsy.
he took phenytoin.
that drug, with the Epstein-Barr virus, is associated with common variable immunodeficiency disease.
T" cells down, "B" cells down. Keeps you from forming enough antibodies.
see, the antibodies are basically your defensive line.
and your brain is like the quarterback.
and then the fungi are like blitzing linebackers plunging up the middle.
your lungs are like
okay, you got two quarterbacks. [Chase] C. V. I.D?
that's a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.
Yeah. Well, it was a stupid idea when you said it.
then he got the respiratory problem, and he tested positive for Epstein-Barr.
that's pretty much a childhood disease.
that's another reason why Chase's suggestion was idiotic. He got it when he was a kid.
he didn't get any symptoms until now. It happens.
it gets triggered by stress- like public speaking.
so you're basing your diagnosis on a virus that's relatively common and a drug he took 30 years ago.
start the senator on I. V. Immunoglobulin, stat.
Lfhe gets better, I'm right. Lfhe dies, you're right.
Dr. House?
you faked that. No.
say "antiretroviral." Antiretroviral.
now, say it three times fast.
we just got your latest blood results. Your white cells are up.
your "T" cells are back over a hundred. That's-That's good, right?
in a week? That's terrific.
you'll need medication for the rest of your life, but other than that, you're fine.
am I well enough to run for president?
why not run for pope while you're at it? - Oh, come on.
kennedy had Addison's. F. D.R. Had polio. Two of the best presidents in the last hundred years.
if they were running today, they wouldn't stand a chance. [Chuckling]
you figure you'd be surgeon general if you didn't have the limp?
no. There's things I can't do.
well, then I'm running.
good for you.
now, don't get excited. He's right. I, uh- I won't win.
then why run?
Oh, I see. Your point being, the only way to make a difference is to win every fight.
but, hey, why listen to me?
I own the company. I'm certainly not to be trusted, right?
Dr. Greg House, on the other hand, has a reputation...
for integrity, among other things.
ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Greg House.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals' extraordinary commitment to research excellence...
is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor, a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease.
that's not a speech.
I thought it was pithy.
you got enough for a press release anyhow. Foreman or Cameron.
a few things I forgot to mention.
ed Vogler is a brilliant businessman, a brilliant judge of people...
and a man who has never lost a fight.
you know how I know that the new ACE inhibitor is good?
cause the old one was good. The new one is really the same, just more expensive.
a lot more expensive.
you see, that's another example of Ed's brilliance.
whenever one ofhis drugs is about to lose its patent, he has his boys and girls alter itjust a tiny bit, patent it all over again, making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars.
which is good for everybody, right?
except the patients. But- [Scoffs] who cares?
they're just so damn sick.
God obviously never liked them anyway.
all the healthy people in the room, let's have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler.
I threw in a joke.
I'm sorry.
I should've taken an extra couple of Vicodin and just held my nose.
I'm guessing you did take a couple extra Vicodin. - True.
you don't need to worry about firing anyone. I'm leaving.
Why?
is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture?
are you trying to protect Foreman? No.
so this is just, "Don't fire me. I quit"?
I'm protecting myself.
you asked me why I like you.
you're abrasive and rude.
but I figured, everything you do, you do it to help people.
but I was wrong.
you do it because it's right.
there are only two ways that I can deal with things.
one is in my control.
that's to leave.
good-bye, House.
that's some bad hat, Harry.
do you feel the spirit?
and in the 39th year of his reign, asa was diseased in his feet, until the disease was exceedingly great.
yet he didn't seek help from the lord, but from the physicians.
now, there is nothing wrong with seeing a doctor.
but can a doctor heal through the power that jesus gave his disciples?
men of science can walk through life with blindfolds never knowing that you or i could not take a single step if we were not uplifted by god.
Agnes, thank you for letting me be an instrument of god's love for you.
in faith...all things are possible.
my friends, I want you to let agnes feel the wave of faith in this church here today lifting her into god's hands.
you can do it! Come on, sister.
praise jesus! Thank you, god!
thank you, lord!
No!
son!
dad, I think i need a doctor.
did you remember my dvd player?
well, if you wanted it, you shouldn't have left it behind when you moved out.
now I get it. It's a drag watching porn on vhs.
I'll call you as soon as I'm done with it.
that's if you ever get a phone installed.
Oh, forget it. I'll come by and get it myself.
after work? Thursday?
won't be home Thursday.
no problem, I still have a key. I can let myself in and out.
I guess maybe I could bring it in tomorrow.
after all, how many times can you hit pause at the part where lindsay lohan wins the spelling bee?
what is it about girls who can spell?
it's math contest.
what is it about girls who can count?
it's poker night, isn't it?
you said weeks ago that I could play. Stop making excuses.
gotta go. Building full of sick people.
if I hurry, maybe I can avoid them.
the abdominal series showed no evidence of obstruction.
What'd you have to eat?
chicken sandwich. We travel. Lots of fast food.
thank you. I barely felt it.
you're welcome.
God told me you were kind.
you talk to god?
God's presence often descends on boyd to help him guide others.
this been going on long?
since he was ten.
God told me I would meet a woman healer...
who was harboring vengeful thoughts about a man she works with.
that's god's job.
I'll keep that in mind.
his urine is dilute.
what does that mean?
it could mean that for some reason hikidneys aren't purifying the way they should, which would let toxins accumulate in his body.
we'll run the blood work and see what it tells us.
thank you, I appreciate it.
God talks to him?
it's not psychosis, he's just religious.
the only medical issue that showed up on the blood work is low sodium.
no, you talk to god, you're religious. God talks to you, you're psychotic.
a lot of people experience their religion as something more than symbolic.
God ever talk to you when you where in the seminary?
no.
God's loss, our gain.
he's either psychotic or a scam artist.
he was actually really impressive.
well, yeah...with the burning bush and all, it's quite the show.
he was intelligent, polite, dignified. He's not a typical 15-year-old.
and he told Cameron god wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.
God knows you stole Cameron's article?
he knows she's "harboring vengeful thoughts."
I'm over it.
Yeah, I can tell that from the berlin wall of body language between you.
I'm shocked that he picked up on it. Low sodium.
check for addison's?
no pigmentation and potassium levels were normal.
cirrhosis?
liver feels fine. Transaminases are normal.
we should monitor his saline intake to correct the low sodium.
no more than one meq per liter per hour.
and let's push the patient history.
see if there's any evidence of drugs or other delusions. I'll take care of it.
you're gonna talk to a patient?
God talks to him.
it'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than god.
so, you're a "faith healer " .
or is that a pejorative?
do you prefer something like "divine health management"?
I though god might have mentioned that I was coming.
I'm okay with "faith healer," dr. House.
that's a nice one. You didn't even go with...
I see an h and a medical coat.
the nurses talk about you a lot.
Ah, don't believe them. I keep a sock in my pants.
faith, that's anoth word for ignorance, isn't it?
I never understood how people could be so proud of believing in something with no proof at all. Like that's an achievement.
God's asking for our trust. You can't love somebody and not trust them.
trust has to be earned.
you can't trust someone hiding in a closet.
you don't trust anyone.
you seem lucid.
there's no confusion, no lethargy. What drugs have you been taking?
nothing. Some aspirin.
I get focused on something, I forget to eat--next thing you know,
I've got a hunger headache.
so aspirin and hospitals are okay.
that's an interesting attitude for someone who's kept any number of people from getting medical help.
just because i believe in prayer doesn't mean I don't believe in germs and toxins.
that bottle's been opened before.
you refilled it at the water cooler.
Yes.
how often do you do that?
a few times an hour. He likes to stay hydrated.
you think germs might have gotten in?
I think water might have gotten in.
we can adjust your pain meds.
again?
suppose we incase your oxycodone.
we both know the only reason i'm talking lucidly now is because I did not take my full dose this morning.
you've done your best.
and I have been a good soldier.
it's time we accept it's over.
what about the trip you were talking about taking?
you've wanted to see florence since you were a teenager, right?
Yeah, go now. All drugged up.
it's not exactly the trip i've been dreaming of.
okay, you're strong.
you're dealing with this.
and there is the right combination of pain meds out there. And we'll find it.
don't give up on us.
and don't be startled by the sound you're about to hear.
excuse me.
I have a friend with boundary issues.
can this wait five minutes?
is she dying?
Yeah.
before the end of this consult?
they could build monuments to your self-centeredness.
patient. 15-year-old. Faith healer. Hotline to god.
what are his symptoms?
he is not a saint.
he figures out what's going on in people's lives by watching, listening, deducing.
and you're worried about trademark infringement?
then he passes on advice from god so he can watch them jump. It's a power trip.
Ah, and there the similarities end. Why is he here?
I fear for the human race.
a teenager claims to be the voice of god and people with advanced degrees are listening.
the majority of Americans believe in a personal god.
what are his symptoms?
massive cramps, low sodium.
turns out he's been drinking water non-stop. God told him to purify his body.
huge water intake would cause low sodium.
which would cause the cramping. Yeah, I got it.
what, that's it? You solved it.
you just brought me out here to rant because faith annoys you?
Mm-hmm. He's all better.
you know, I'd get it if people were just looking for a way to fill the holes.
but they want the holes. They wanna live in the holes.
and they go nuts when someone else pours dirt in their holes.
climb out of your holes, people!
go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere go tell it on the mountain that jesus christ is born go tell it on the mountain over the hills and everywhere go tell it on the mountain that jesus christ is born boyd, are you all right?
go tell it on the mountain boyd. Over the hills and...
come on, let's go. Can you tell me your name?
do you know where you are?
God doesn't want you to be afraid.
he sent me here to heal you.
you think he hasn't heard you prayers, but he heard them all. Even the ones you didn't say.
sorry. Boyd, come on. Let's get you back to your room.
in faith, all things are possible.
let's go.
Lord...I call on you to relieve the suffering of your daughter.
grace? - And make her whole again.
Hey, hey! What are you doing? What is this?
he's just had a complex partial seizure. His disoriented.
he doesn't know what he's doing.
well get him back to his room--now.
you okay?
are we certain he even had a seizure?
hymn singing and healing. He does it all the time, doesn't he?
isn't it interesting that religious behavior is so close to being crazy, we can't tell 'em apart.
the repetition, the lack of affect and awareness. It was a seizure.
infection?
no fever.
could be Wilson's. Or maybe it's a glycogen storage disease.
or a brain tumor.
or tuberous sclerosis.
how to settle this?
we could ask our patient to ask god. Or we could mri his brain.
which way do you wanna go?'Cause I'm open to all possibilities.
house! Why the hell do you let an unstable patient wander the hallways?
his leash broke.
the last thing a terminal patient needs is to hear somebody taunt them with a cure.
she was freaked, she was angry.
and now she's not freaked and angry. And you are.
she says she's "feeling better."
maybe not singing and dancing, but she's feeling just a little bit happy for the first time in months.
sudden drop in pain can create euphoria.
why don't you let her have her vacation?
Oh, that's great. And when the vacation's over, when she crash lands from all this denial? She was dealing with her illness.
now her expectations are rising.
and you're not the one who has to be there when all that false hope gets yanked out from under her.
don't you guys have anything to do?
how long have you been healing people?
you believe that's what I'm doing?
I'd like to.
but you don't.
why do you always do things you don't wanna do?
it's okay, I don't expect a real answer.
you know, god would probably want you to take that stick out of your butt and get over this.
if there is some higher order running the universe, it's probably so different from anything our species can conceive, there's no point in even thinking about it.
but I doubt it gives a damn about my butt.
so you believe god might exist, but you don't think about it?
it's the most important issue
I think penguins might as well speculate about nuclear physics.
why are we having this conversation?
what? I'm curious.
you cannot tell someone they are your colleague and not a friend and then casually chat about the afterlife.
you actually keep score?
your MRI results aren't done yet.
go back to your room. No singing.
well, you would get a point for figuring why the low sodium.
what are my guy's points for?
your trick about the spat between dr. Cameron and dr. Foreman apparently impressed someone.
and the second point?
do you think it could be because I healed grace?
she's been back to see me. I like her.
you like messing with people.
that's why you're here now.
maybe you think that your batteries are powered by god, maybe you don't.
either way, you enjoy what you do.
Yes. I like helping people.
I get a rush when I see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone.
mm, but you make sure you're in the next state by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.
that doesn't happen.
Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?
God told me.
see, that's not fair. We were having fun.
it's hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there.
he spoke with me about you too.
forgive my enemies?
never date a taurus when mercury's in retrograde?
Yeah, I learned that one myself--the hard way.
God says you look for excuses to be alone.
see, that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep, but you could say it about any person who doesn't pine for the social approval of everyone he meets.
which you were cleverly able to deduce about me but not being a moron.
next time tell god to be more specific.
God wants you to invite dr. Wilson to your poker game.
don't talk to my patient.
what are you talking about?
you get all huffy when my patient stumbles into yours in the hallway.
but you got no qualms about chatting my guy up.
this is fun, it's like password.
keep talking, I'll jump in when I get a clue what the hell you're talking about.
God knows about my poker game.
you think I told him?
either that or I start going to church every Sunday.
that would mess with my bowling league.
house, aside from yelling at him to get back to his room,
I've never spoken to your patient.
MRI shows an abnormal area.
tuberous sclerosis.
it's the right neighborhood. Accounts for all the symptoms.
all of them.
leading cortical tuber's identifiable.
we can do this surgically.
tell our patient congratulations.
soon these chats with god will be a thing of the past.
tie goes to the mortal.
did you know the catholic church keeps a doctor at lourdes?
he hears the same thing every day.
but out of the thousands of cases of people who have claimed to feel better, the catholic church has only recognized a handful as miracles.
but they do recognize a handful.
well, they're a church.
it's what they do.
look, for the past couple of years, the world's been getting smaller.
eight months, six months.
I watch a trailer for a movie...
and I think, am I gonna be here when that comes out?
but maybe there is still a horizon out there.
you know, maybe...maybe I can make plans for a year from now. Two years.
I like the view.
the view is a lie. And if you believe it, you're going to crash so hard...
let me take new images of your liver.
you can't accept that it could be true.
well, if it is true, you shouldn't be afraid of proving it.
tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder.
it causes small, benign tumors to grow in various parts of the body. In this case, the brain.
you said benign.
they probably are. But benign or not, they're not in a good location.
we need to remove them.
you're talking brain surgery?
his symptoms are getting worse which means the tumors are growing.
surgery will correct it all. The chemical imbalance, the seizures, the auditory hallucinations.
hallucinations?
without the surgery, it's just gonna get worse. It might even be fatal.
with the surgery, your son should be a perfectly normal 15-year-old boy.
I'm not normal.
I need you to talk to my patient.
I'll get this one.
why do I have the feeling you're plotting world domination?
moses is refusing surgery.
you have a gift.
people thank you for telling them they're gonna die.
if I can get him to agree to surgery,
I want in on the poker game.
you would let this kid die, just to get into a stupid game?
you'd let him die just to keep me out?
Hi.
I'm dr. Wilson.
I knew they'd send somebody else.
that god has a big mouth.
can I ask...
why you don't want the tumors removed?
God put them there for a reason.
you think god needs a telephone in your head to talk to you?
isn't he everywhere?
it's not a long distance call, is it?
this is the way god does things.
through natural law.
if he went around doing big, flashy miracles all the time, nobody would need faith.
how come everyone else needs faith, but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear?
your turn.
do you think god wants you to die?
this is the way that the lord often is with his chosen ones.
he gives the most trials to those that he loves the most.
how sweet.
you abdicate your authority.
avoid those tricky parental issues like whether to let him drive at 16.
just let him die at 15.
so you believe your son is...
um, a saint.
the way i understand it, one of the hallmarks of a saint is humility.
someone with true humility would consider the possibility that...
God hadn't chosen him for that kind of honor.
he'd consider the possibility that...
he just had an illness.
you have a gift for manipulation.
I listen.
I have an actual conversation with people.
which, shockingly, does raise the odds they'll be cooperative.
that's what I'm saying.
you read that kid, and you manipulated the hell out of him.
bring pretzels.
I know that knock!
use your key, I'm not getting up.
game's not till tomorrow night.
and those aren't pretzels.
I took some images of grace palmieri's cancer.
yeah?
her tumor has shrunk.
don't tell my patient.
I want all the records on miracle woman
every test, every treatment she's ever had.
every question she's ever answered in this hospital.
and anything sent from previous doctors.
go back to neonatal if you have...
which part of "keep them away from each other" confused you?
they're friends.
she thinks he saved her life.
and we've obligingly offered medical proof that his delusions are true.
they've withdrawn permission for the surgery.
I've put the lawyers on it.
her tumor shrank?
I'm on it.
tell jesus that we need another 24 hours to normalize his sodium level.
he's already normalized.
actually, tell joseph.
Jesus'll know you're lying.
and I want you and Foreman and Cameron to go over every line of every file on that woman.
isn't he the one we're supposed to save?
the only way to save him is to prove that she is still dying.
MRI machine checks out.
maybe the radiologist mischarted which machine they used.
I checked both.
this is insane.
we're diagnosing a recovery.
what about six months ago?
maybe there was a malfunction on her before pictures.
some shadow that made the tumor look bigger than it really was.
I'll go see what I can find out.
maybe it's a delayed effect from radiation.
sometimes it can take a while.
she hasn't had radiation for six months.
here.
nowhere. Her records...
there's about a dozen appliances in every home that give off radiation.
dosages that wouldn't hurt a hamster if it was tied to the machine for a year.
if the machine's operating properly.
sometimes remissions just happen.
you think house will just shrug and say that if one of us doesn't check the home?
kings on 9s.
thank you.
Wilson, this is...
uh, dry cleaner, tax accountant, guy from the bus stop.
this is wilson.
how come he gets a name?
seniority.
hello.
find anything?
you have any idea how many electrical devices give off radiation?
all of them.
I'm gonna be here all night.
everybody's a whiner.
be a doer, not a me too-er.
raise.
I'm out.
she's got at least four different types of pain pills here and an led device.
I'll raise your raise.
keep looking.
fold.
you were bluffing.
he knew you were bluffing.
your luck's changing tonight.
so did they find anything?
or are you gonna have to accept the fact that every now and then remissions happen?
this call had better be worth my time.
this is what happens when it's not our patient.
we don't know enough.
that's why you're there.
she's got a boyfriend.
unless you think he's radioactive...
he could show up any minute.
the honor of working for you is not worth a felony charge.
give me a minute.
I'm saying the odds of you having a straight flush are pretty low.
I'll fold.
fold.
fold.
I'm screwed, aren't I?
nine bucks for a straight flush.
he's not coming home.
relax.
there's nothing in this universe that can't be explained...eventually.
take this game.
only two people knew that you wanted in on it.
I didn't tell him.
I told you, I didn't tell him.
why would you?
the only person he's been getting all intimate and conversational with is your cancer chick.
how would she know?
the subject of my poker game isn't likely to come up in the course of a patient interview.
no, that's the kind of thing you mention to someone you're used to sharing the details of you day with.
don't.
your rabbi...
a guidance counselor.
a parent.
she's not your mom, is she?
I'm seriously saying don't.
you've been having sex...
this is so not the place.
with our miracle woman.
excuse me, am I...may I talk to you?
of course.
Boyd's getting dressed.
he's ready to check out.
he can't check out without your permission.
his sodium level still isn't normal.
I told him. He said that god said it was okay.
he was fine.
could you talk to him?
tell them my name isn't Wilson.
most people in your situation just have their careers to worry about.
you've got that and divine retribution.
tell them.
tell me how it happened, and I'll tell them whatever you want.
she'd had a bad day.
Pain-wise.
her ride didn't show up to take her home.
so you offered.
Yeah.
she didn't have any groceries.
she was too sick to go out.
I figured I could afford to take a half hour.
pick her up and few things.
and stay and make sure she's okay.
Yeah.
and never leave.
you told me you got an apartment.
but you moved in with her.
you lied to me.
tell them.
his name is not Wilson, and he's screwed up worse than I am.
okay, yes, I lied to you.
I'm sorry.
half the doctors who specialize in oncology turn into burnt out cases.
but you, you eat neediness.
lucky for you.
thanks for the game, guys.
I don't think i'll be coming back.
you're a functional vampire.
sure, you're heroic, useful to society.
but only because it feeds you.
there's nothing worth stealing, so don't even look.
you don't just have a fetish for needy people, you marry them!
here we go! - You mean it!
and then time passes, suddenly they're not so needy anymore.
your fault.
you've been there for them too much.
they're getting healthy, independent.
and that's just ugly.
God, you must be pissed at god right now.
making her all happy.
why are you doing this?
because you're being stupid.
you know what you're risking by sleeping with a patient.
Oh, that's crap.
you're not mad because i'm risking my job.
you're not even mad because I lied to you.
you're mad because i lied to you, and you couldn't tell.
Yeah, you got me nailed.
Yeah, that's why you didn't want me in your poker game.
because when it comes to being in control, gregory house leaves our faith healer kid in the dust.
and that's why religious belief annoys you.
because if the universe operates by abstract rules, you can learn them, you can protect yourself.
if a supreme being exists, he can squash you any time he wants.
he knows where I am.
I think it's yours.
Yeah.
I'll be right there.
Jesus is spiking a fever.
he's delusional.
tuberous sclerosis doesn't cause fever.
I know.
I'll drive.
pick any random guy off the street.
bring him in here, examine him exhaustively.
you will find at least three things wrong with him.
this kid has tuberous sclerosis.
a mild case.
but his tumors are growing.
we assumed that the tumors were growing.
cause he's getting sicker.
but he could have grown old and died and never known about them if he hadn't come here.
we were looking for something that was more or less in the right part of the brain.
it's like we found someone standing over a dead body holding a gun.
we arrested them, didn't look any further.
well, sometimes people really do just stumble into a murder scene.
his fever is 103 and rising.
if we don't do anything, he's gonna be chatting with god face to face real soon.
fevers don't come from a long-term underlying condition.
he's a garden variety religious nut who happens to have an infection.
it's lumbar puncture time.
no.
no, god told me no more of man's medicine.
if we have faith in him, he'll make me well.
it's just a test.
we just wanna find out what's wrong.
God knows what's wrong.
God will take care of it.
he's delirious, and he's a minor.
this is your decision, and not his.
the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in field which when a man finds, he hides.
for joy he goes and sells all he owns and buys that field.
buy all the land you want!
don't blow your brains out.
you're watching your son kill himself!
he's out of his mind with fever.
dad, if your faith is weak,
I will fail.
I need you.
I'm sorry.
you don't even know what's wrong with him.
God knows the answer.
and I would rather leave it in his hands than yours.
I need you to do your thing.
you do know that I don't actually have magical powers.
I have faith.
you're better off trying to slip some antibiotics into a meal...
which antibiotics?
we don't know what infection he's got.
go as broad as you can.
forget it.
our best hope is your silver tongue.
what if it's not an infection?
where you not paying attention when I was doing my murder scene metaphor?
what if the tuberous sclerosis is guilty?
it had the gun in its hand, it was standing over...
doesn't cause fever.
it causes everything else.
what if the fever's the innocent bystander?
fever could have been set off by something he picked up anywhere.
could have been a bug he got here.
or a bug he gave here.
he gave it to your patient.
that's why her tumor shrank.
the virus went after the cancer first.
are you saying a virus attacked her tumor?
for 200 years, there have been reports of wild viruses that target tumors.
early 1900s, an Italian medical journal wrote up a woman with cervical cancer who was injected with a weak strain of rabies.
I have no idea why they did that, but her tumor shrank.
you think he gave her rabies?
one of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells is herpes.
herpes encephalitis.
it would fit.
seizure, low sodium.
even the blurred vision.
and it would mean if you're right, grace's cancer is coming back.
you're not gonna be able to convince them.
they don't want any more tests.
they don't wanna...
they can't argue with the mark of cain.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
no more tests.
God knows the way.
okay, let's start with his shirt.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
I'm on a mission from god.
if you won't let me undress you, then strip.
what's he doing? What's going on?
that woman you helped, you gave her a virus.
no, she's healed. I have a gift
a gift is jewelry, socks.
what you have is herpes encephalitis.
the only way you could have transmitted it is by scratching one of your own sores and touching another person.
herpes, that's something you get from sex, right?
either that or cold sores.
your kid got it from the sex.
no, no sores.
no, my body is clean.
they examined me when I came in. No sores.
herpes hides.
you have an outbreak, it goes away, comes back, goes away.
strip!
you didn't have a sore when you came in, but you've got one now.
dad, I've never ever
you ever wonder why a perfect child of god should feel so desperate to purify his body that he needed to scarf down a dozen gallons of water a day?
Boyd, is he right?
dad, no, he's crazy.
help me.
Dr. Wilson, help!
God said no medicine, no procedures.
taking off your clothes doesn't count as either of those.
this one's your call.
son...
dad, you have to have faith in me.
I have faith in the lord.
you, I trust.
as much as you can trust a teenage boy.
take off your clothes.
relax.
a few hail marys, a little acyclovir.
you'll be picking up angels again in no time.
come in.
my father told me i have to apologize to you.
still hearing voices?
you're lucky.
you go through life with a certainty that what you're doing is right.
I know how comforting that is.
good luck.
you're not gonna give me my final point?
you knew it was me?
who else?
you don't think god should get a point knocked off?
the tumor shrank.
because of a virus.
do you know what the odds are?
she had to have the right type of cancer.
he had to have the right type of virus.
the exposure had to be
she won the lottery.
you say won the lottery, he says...miracle.
Yeah, the hand of god reached into this kid's pants, made him have sex so he could scratch a rash, stick his fingers in some woman's face, give her a few extra months.
come on, he's just another liar and manipulator.
well, nobody's as perfect as you are.
it is possible to believe in something and still fail to live up to it.
so, how's your girlfriend?
she got a little extra time out of this not a lot.
she didn't crash?
no...
she says she's happier when she believes in something bigger than she is.
she still believes.
faith.
she's going to Florence.
you moving out?
Yeah.
moving back in with me?
I don't think that's a great idea.
but we're okay.
house, you are...
as god made you.
you high, popo?
cop with a sense of humor. You can check the cop car.
also check his personal car, work, home.
Foreman, get out!
am I the only one who finds this funny?
you stole my article.
I wouldn't do that.
we're not friends, we're colleagues.
Ow! Son of a bitch!
now we're both exposed.
I'm gonna die.
you die, I die. It's not gonna happen.
time of death, 12: 26 P. M.
I need a bone saw.
I'm sorry. I wish I could. --You said you
I just want a little tiny slice of this guy's brain, that's all I need.
just enough to tell me what's killing Foreman.
a thin slice of Joe's brain could also cause a public health crisis.
it's not a good idea to scream "fire" every time somebody lights a match.
don't downplay this, house.
you put both of them in isolation for a reason.
Joe's death elevates this situation to a biosafety level three.
Ooh, level three.
you should call jack bauer.
I called the cdc.
well, tell them I'll be really, really careful.
we don't have the proper equipment for you to be really, really careful.
you can do whatever you want to Foreman, but the cdc will do this autopsy.
whatever. The point is, we'll be lucky to get results in three days.
I told them how urgent this is.
and they told you?
we'll have the results in three days.
Aw, that's a shame.
because foreman will never get to know what it was. He'll be dead in 36 hours.
maybe this is a toxin. Maybe it's not contagious at all, and you're killing foreman because of a maybe.
well, you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is.
foreman. Come here, fast.
what's going on?
when are they doing the autopsy?
you're doing it. Now.
you ever study how they used to do ice pick lobotomies?
I read about it in med school. Why would I
shove an ice pick into the eye socket. Just above the tear duct.
bang it a couple of times with a hammer, get a sample.
what's going on, man?
Foreman, you can't do it.
you'll be in violation of
can't do the time if you're not alive.--You.
I need you to suit up.
get that equipment away from dr. Foreman.
take your time, guys.
why don't you just tell him to go slow? Won't be your fault.
we don't even know what kind of contagion we're dealing with.
which is why we need to chop into the guy's head.
it's dangerous.--Not to you, foreman.
there are other ways to diagnose you.
yeah? You have the answer?
Foreman, do it now.
I am warning you, do not
what are you doing?
that didn't feel right.
he's blind.
he thinks he can see. Same as the cop.
I need something to bag the sample.
forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.
no, no, no. I'm fine.
house, there's the sample. Get it, test it.
you gotta test that sample!
apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours.
intractable, unbearable pain is up next.
sure you don't want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?
physically, his eyes are fine.
problem's isolated to his brain.
damage to the occipital lobe extends from the primary visual cortex
should we test him for bacterial meningitis?
if it was meningitis, we'd all be sick.
his csf could show signs--that would be pointless.
we already did a brain biopsy. It was negative.
toxic mold?
if it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.
how do we know you're not sick?
do I seem happy to you?
never.
it was funny.
well, let's assume it's not blood-borne.
if you start cracking jokes, we can re-assess.
in the meantime, stay away from people and animals that you care about.
Guillian-barr?
neither of them had any sort of paralysis.
Joe could have died before the paralysis had a chance to present.
what about arbovirus?
start treatment.
for arbovirus?
you think our jersey beat cop has been spending a lot of time exploring deep, dark Africa?
treatment for everything.
likely or unlikely. If you can think of it, treat for it.
mixing that many meds will create all sorts of toxic interactions.
we'll box his liver, trash his kidneys. There's got to be a better way.
of course there's a better way!
it's that body sitting in the room with him that cuddy won't let us touch.
Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals, parasites. It's got to be one of them.
where are you going?
to see if I can find another brain to biopsy.
we're going to lock Joe up downstairs until the cdc gets here.
Foreman, you can't see.
right.
house wants to start you on some meds. They're in the airlock.
for what?
leading candidate is toxic mold.
is Cameron sick?
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
you're casting your net a little wider than toxic mold, aren't you?
Guillian-barr? is also on the table.
this is an oval shape...has either an l or a 7.
I'm guessing an L. Levofloxacin, because you can't rule out bacteria.
eight, zero, zero. That's the dosage for the acylovir in case it's viral.
Square...no, more like a rhombus.
that's fluconazole for fungus.
there's about eight others here. You
you're treating me for everything.
you have no idea what I've got.
house thinks this is the best course of action.
house is desperate.
house is never desperate.
something we give you will work.
Yeah, we should start treating all patients this way.
when they get sick, they just take everything.
it's better than doing nothing.
Hello?
I'm at the cop's place.
I need to retrace your steps.
you don't think the "treat him for everything" approach is enough?
where did you start your search?
the kitchen.
you will tell me everything you did, everything you touched.
if you went to the john, I want to know when and why.
I started with samples from the mold in his sink.
what next?
that's it. Then I left.
what do we do now?
wait for Steve Mcqueen to get giddy.
excellent plan.
Hey, dad.
it's Eric. I'm not doing too good.
how's foreman?
you're accessing a webcam?
Cuddy's shower.
are you a fan of the brazilian? I
is that your kitchen?
well, obviously I couldn't bring him here.
he's been exposed to whatever foreman's got.
you infected Steve?
why didn't you just get a rat from the pet store?
because...I needed one with a clean medical history.
who knows what kind of antibiotics they give those rats?
so this is your plan? Just sit here and watch your rat all day?
well, it shouldn't take long.
got the ac blasting, I soaped the floor of his cage...
as soon as he gets sick, I do an autopsy.
as soon as he's dead.
right after he gets sick, there's a good chance he'll get hit in the head with A...
cane-shaped object.
normally you just use your patients as lab rats.
it's a nice change.
first symptom is euphoria.
how do you know if a rat's euphoric?
he doesn't usually climb on his water bottle like that, does he?
the seizures only seem to happen when she's in her car seat.
she starts to rock and grunt.
she responsive?
no, no, it's like she's in a zone.
and her abdominal muscles become dystonic.
big word.
someone's been on the interweb.
I looked up a few articles on epilepsy.
you know, there's actually some really great youth soccer leagues, that would cater specifically to her special needs, and...
I think it might explain why she's been having a hard time in preschool.
let's confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back.
strobing lights and high-pitched sounds can provoke a seizure.
you're a goof.
takes one to know one, loser.
wait, that means I'm a loser. Scratch that.
these episodes. She get sweaty afterwards?
soaking wet.
and does she seem upset by them, or just tired?
no, she kind of thinks it's funny.
you mix rocking, grunting, sweating, and dystonia with concerned parents, and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy.
in actuality, all your little girl is doing is saying "yoo hoo"to the "hoo hoo.
she's what?
marching the penguin.
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.
finding nemo.
that was funny.
it's called gratification disorder. Sort of a misnomer.
if one was unable to gratify oneself, that would be a disorder.
are you saying she's masturbating?
I was trying to be discreet. There's a child in the room.
Oh, this is horrifying.
epilepsy is horrifying.
teach your girl about privacy and she'll be fine. Here you go.
thank you.
one afternoon, and you're on pace to set the record for most patients seen in a month.
you're upset that I'm doing clinic hours?
wow, that is so like rain on your wedding day.
for the past three hours, I have been on the phone with the cdc, while you are
Yeah, how's that going, by the way?
they promised to expedite
tough to do an autopsy when they haven't even picked up the body.
it's tough to treat your patient when you're not even on the same floor.
go. Clinic is covered.
I go watch the meds drip into his iv.
you think that'll make the treatment work faster?
go to your office. Play with your ball.
write on your whiteboard. Insult your team.
do whatever it is that you do to figure things out.
feeling guilty?
it's not too late to change your mind. Go call the cdc.
tell 'em you were just joshing.
keep avoiding foreman's case until he dies.
then I'll drown in guilt.
feeling any better?
how are you doing?
I'm not the patient.
is your sed rate elevated?
no.
so far, it looks like I lucked out.
looks like you left a tourniquet on the bed.
you can see again?
the treatment's working.
the question is, which treatment?
we'll start weaning him off one at a time. Which one do we start with?
I don't care if you do it alphabetically. Just stay on top of his vision.
first sign of regression means we've taken him off the wrong one.
the latest blood work.
Foreman's amylase and lipase levels are three times normal.
pancreas is failing.
a toxic side effect of his meds.
philosophical question.
how do you want to die?
old age.
your choice is currently between 4 hours from now and 14 hours from now.
so I'm assuming that means you want the latter.
the cocktail's working.
my vision's almost completely restored.
the meds are curing what's in your head, but they're trashing your pancreas.
that's why you're puking and you can't stand up without screaming.
so lower the dosages.
less stress on my pancreas, still battle the infection.
lower dosages will still be toxic.
I don't care!
I can handle the pain of the pancreatitis.
I don't think you can handle life without a pancreas.
we keep you on these meds, you'll spend the last four hours of your life being able to see.
take you off, you'll go blind again.
but it'll give us time to figure out what's eating your brain.
fine.
what do we do next?
dad?
Yeah, you two can get caught up later.
sir, I need you to come with me.
uh...what is this?
he isn't a what, he's a who.
they even have the right to vote now.
nice to meet you, ma'am.
this is foreman's dad.
Yeah, I got that.
and dr. Cuddy, here, is the dean of medicine.
remember that cool autopsy i was telling you about, the one that would save your son's life?
she's the one can give us the green light to do it.
I understand you don't want them to do it.
Dr. House didn't seem to know why.
Mr. Foreman, I am doing everything I can to get the cdc
won't be soon enough.
and my decision to follow public health safety protocols oh, don't blame the rules.
don't want to hang this on policy and protocol.
I'm well aware that it may cost your son his life, just as I am well aware that my decision has a devastating effect on family and friends without having them paraded in front of me.
your son has an unknown, contagious, deadly infection.
if we don't contain it here, even more people could be at risk.
and I am capable of empathizing with those people too without having them paraded in front of me.
I understand.
what's wrong with your hand?
it's--it's called a muscle contraction.
I thought this thing was in your brain.
it is. It just means the infection's moved to the primary motor cortex, which controls the muscles.
aren't you glad you sent me to med school?
does it hurt?
no.
is it gonna?
the--the other guy...
he didn't seem to suffer too much, he
just went in his sleep.
steve still acting normal? No sign of contractures.
they got the cop's body in a locked, airtight bag.
and a guard on the door.
these feds are seriously paranoid.
he hasn't gotten up to pee in hours. He's due.
you haven't sprinkled senokot granules on his doughnut?
his bowels would open up like the red sea.
he wouldn't eat the doughnut.
have you seriously been dn here for hours?
no.
I had to pee a couple times.
you've got to stop blaming cuddy for this.
given that it is her fault, that seems appropriate.
that part is her fault.
the part where somebody wasted his time in the basement, plotting the overthrow of a government agency, that one's on you.
the only think I can do is think. I can pretty much do that anywhere.
as long as no one's bugging me.
did you call your brother?
no.
did you?
no.
it's not a big deal.
I sure would have liked to see mom, though.
you know she can't travel anymore.
you tell her?
Why?
just upset her for a while.
then she wouldn't remember for a while.
think she should know?
she's lost a lot of who she was.
she can't deal with something like this.
and you can?
I still know you're going to a better place.
it's easy for you, isn't it?
as long as you believe I'm going to a better place, dying ain't so bad.
I don't want you to be afraid.
if I'm not afraid of dying, what the hell should I be afraid of, dad?
I thought you believed.
I did.
I'm not so sure anymore.
I'm going to pray for you, son.
I suggest you do the same.
field of vision is regressing.
and he's reached an eight on the pain scale.
the disease pattern is following the exact course as Joe's.
only it's moving much faster in Foreman.
good! It's an anomaly.
Anomals tell us things. Why is this moving faster in foreman? What's different?
could be a different strain of the same disease?
Right--we were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease.
we should have been looking for a different strain of an unknown disease.
Joe's a cop.
he's into physical fitness, he could have had...
a more powerful immune system, stronger metabolism.
Foreman's black.
what?
how long have you been sitting on this information?
lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetes, stop me any time, they all affect black people more than whites.
check everything.
Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites.
look for anything with a documented racial disparity.
wait.
the rat's showing symptoms?
no.
he's completely healthy.
maybe that's the difference between foreman and the cop.
how are you feeling?
why are you here?
because you're a friend. And I should be here.
I'm sorry house used my dad to try and manipulate you.
you've got integrity, you aren't going to change your mind just because you're confronted by my father.
thank you.
just like I'm not going to forgive you just because you come by here and ask how I'm feeling.
you know I've had no choice.
of course you had a choice!
regulations are clear.
and the punishment for violating those regulations!
is it death?
because frankly, I'm okay if you get a fine, a suspension
hell, you can spend a couple of years in jail if it saves my life!
you're dying too fast.
couldn't agree more.
Hey, cuddy.
having a nice visit?
what's that?
Legionel--legionella pneumophila.
and why are you carrying a vial of it around with you?
foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection.
our cop wasn'T. He had legionnaire's disease.
our cop didn't turn into brain food until we cured the legionella.
legionella slowed down the disease.
why would that happen?
no idea. I just know that it did.
so you want to infect foreman?
gonna tattle to the cdc?
meds can't help me, but a disease can?
forget it! Just take the pain away and put me under.
if I put you under, I can't monitor your pain.
if I can't monitor your pain, I won't know if the legionella's working.
I'm not consenting to you giving me
what was that?
I wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something.
would've been much more dramatic.
keep your slippers on.
wouldn't want you to cut your foot.
do you feel any better?
I can't breathe. I'm dizzy.
and I can barely hear anything over the sounds of my lungs crackling.
that's the legionella.
you figure that out from the symptoms, or from the vial of stuff tossed in my room?
I'm trying to be professional here. There's no reason to be nasty.
I'm in pain.--So is house.
and he's a delight.
he doesn't try to kill his colleagues.
you can remove the thermometer now.
it's down almost a whole degree.
how's the pain?
great.
this is the good kind.
how bad is it compared to an hour ago?
no worse.
the legionella helping?
Yeah.
Good.--Not great.
didn't fix anything, it just slowed it down.
the point was to give steve a little more time to get sick.
what are you going to do if he never gets sick?
brilliant.
cameron, what type of illnesses affect humans, but not rats?
why are you asking me that?
because I'm sure that you spent the first 12 years of your life dreaming of being a vet.
the rat is not getting sick. Cameron is not getting sick.
sorry.
it's okay, it's not your fault.
presumably, you're still healthy because whatever it is, is not bloodborne.
steve has no excuse. He did everything that foreman did.
some bacterial infections don't infect rats.
foreman tested negative for every bacterial infection that would affect his brain.
and what infections could he be positive for, but test negative for?
when we test for infections, we look for antibodies.
but what if the patient is infected, but has no antibodies?
what if the body is not fighting the infection?
why would
I asked first.
let's start with the what. We'll deal with the why later.
if the body doesn't recognize the infection, our tests come back negative, and the disease rampages through the body unstopped.
exactly like the cop and exactly like foreman.
and what if the patient was then exposed to a second infection?
like legionella?
the body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire.
so the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects humans but not rats, and the human body would be unlikely to recognize?
the answer is listeria.
I'm starting you on ampengent.
so you're basing this theory on the test being negative and your rat being healthy?
and the fact that legionnaire's is helping you.
but the medicine you want to give me will put an end to that.
Yeah.
and if it's not listeria, all the gent will do is cure the legionnaire's disease and put whatever is killing me back into overdrive.
stop asking me questions based on the premise that I'm wrong.
the antibiotics are in the airlock.
I think the first biopsy didn't give us the answer because you didn't go deep enough.
I want you to do a white matter brain biopsy.
Absolutely. Don't blame you.
the world is such a complicated place if you've got higher reasoning skills.
I'm often jealous of small animals and retarded children.
take the antibiotics.
there can be minimal damage if it's done right.
if the surgeons drill where I tell them to drill.
one slip--you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth.
I'd rather be disabled than dead.
sure, I make it look oh so sexy.
it's actually not as glamorous as you might think.
the biopsy will tell us for sure what's wrong.
the antibiotics could do the same thing.
could, not will.
we try it, we see.
the antibiotics will bring back the pain.
pain makes us make bad decisions.
fear of pain...is almost as big a motivator.
look, we still have time.
I will do that biopsy if I have to.
but not a moment before.
start foreman on I. V. Antibiotics. Where's his dad?
where are you supposed to be when your son is dying?
he's not with him.
he's in the chapel.
I started your son on a new course of treatment.
if it works, he'll get better.
if it doesn't, he won't.
while he's not getting better, he's going to experience so much pain that we'll have to put him in a chemically-induced coma while we figure out what to do next.
my son says you're a manipulative bastard.
it's a pet name.
I call him dr. Bling.
I assume you're here for a reason. What do you want from me?
when your son is in a coma, you're the one who's going to have to make the medical decisions for him.
Oh, whatever you decide is fine.
you don't care what I do?
I'm not a doctor. What do I know?
except what Eric tells me.
he says you're the best doctor he's ever worked with.
I need your help.
there's nothing I can give you for the pain.
I want to be put out.
I can have a nurse in here in five minutes.
no. Want some help.
I might not come back.
I've never done a will.
I'll call a lawyer for you.
I want you to be my medical proxy.
all the things that piss me off about you in house's office
you're too emotional, too caring, too cautious
they're all good things on this floor.
your dad is -no.
he cares about you.- -So do you.
I can't do this.
we expect family members to make decisions about their loved ones after a ten-minute briefing that we're agonizing over even with years of medical experience.
that's from my article.
I'm sorry, Allison.
I shouldn't have stolen your article. I shouldn't have exposed you.
you were a friend.
I need to know that we're okay.
no.
I'll be your proxy, but we're not okay.
you're scared you're dying. And that's the only reason you want to set things right.
we're going to get you better first, and then, if you still want to apologize, I'll be around.
I'll call that lawyer.
any improvement?
well, as far as we can tell, the only thing the antibiotics are treating is the legionella.
I think we need to consider alternate theories.
like what?
we do the biopsy. We
give the antibiotics more time.
there is no more time. The pain is almost unbearable already.
so he's almost in unbearable pain. He's not almost dead.
which means we have more time.
Mr. Foreman?
we need to put your son in a coma.
you should be there.
it's a medical procedure, right?
Yeah.
but once we put him out, if--if we don't solve this, he won't wake up.
what should I say?
should I talk to him like it's going to be...okay?
or should I be saying good-bye?
I need to know what people say when
just tell him you love him.
Hey, son.
Hey, dad.
it's going to be okay.
you don't know that.
I know.
you don't.
I don't want to miss you.
I love you too, dad.
Hey.
it's gotta to be okay.
can we do this now?--Yeah, of course.
I accept your apology.
why weren't you with foreman?
I hang out in the basement, you rag on me.
I stay in my office, you rag on me.
Honkey just can't buy a break.
do the biopsy.
based on the cop's progression, I figure he's got about another four hours
you figure?
you're playing russian roulette, but the gun's pointed at him.
no, cutting open his head is what's dangerous.
Oh, it's dangerous. Well, what would people think?
the reason you don't see patients is because if you know them, you'll give a crap about them. --I know you.
if you give a crap, you stop making outrageous calls.
if this was any other patient, you'd have damned the risk and cut their head open a long time ago.
he's out. The eeg shows he's still in pain.
the antibiotics have had more than enough time. We're doing the brain biopsy.
not unless you people can't come up with something clever in the next three hours.
now. We're doing it now.
who died and made you boss?--Foreman.
it's legal.
he's out of his mind.
yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guy's head.
then hire a lawyer and challenge it. In the meantime, Cameron's in charge.
why would he sign that?
it's nothing personal, mr. Foreman.
my son doesn't trust me. How exactly is that not personal?
I'm sorry.
you're sorry?
you're talking about this man's son.
you're denying him the right to be a part of--oh, shut up, house.
if you want to do the biopsy, do the biopsy.
if house tries to interfere, let me know and I will take care of it.
Yeah. You're a hero.
if it wasn't for you, we'd be cutting into a dead guy's head instead of Foreman's.
sorry.
Thanks.
that was great!--It was rude and unnecessary.
Yeah.
go away.
give me time.
we're out of time.--An hour.
what does "out of time" mean?
his o2 stats are 94 right now.
his lungs are about 90. The danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.
so what? There's no point in waiting.
you were right. We should be cutting into a corpse's head.
Yeah, we should be, except the cdc's got the cop's body
there's got to be other bodies.
you think this thing has killed other people?
no.
that apartment was a dump.
just because Steve mcqueen didn't get sick doesn't mean some other vermin didn't.
you give me an hour. I go back there, I find a dead animal,
I cut its head open instead of Foreman's.
Foreman's already on 100% oxygen.
once his o2 seds hit 90, I can't wait any longer.
Where's your suit?
either you'll find the answer, or I'll find the answer.
doesn't matter.
put the drill.
we gotta be ready to go if we get the signal.
I found a blind bird.
great.
how fast can you get it in here?
I'll know in about 30 seconds.
you better have the bird. The surgical team's in place.
I screwed up.
how can you not capture a blind bird?
that's not what I meant.
I screwed up the first time through this place.
foreman told you everywhere he went.
it's not where, it's when.
he came here early afternoon.
me and Steve came through two hours too late. You were six hours early.
it's the water. The irrigation system only pumps
house, I tested the water. The water's clean.
we tested the wrong water.
he stole cable, he stole fertilizer, and he stole water.
it's riddled with naegleria.
I know.
you already did the biopsy.
I thought I had no choice.
how's my son?
he has primary amebic meningoencephalitis.
it's a parasite that goes through the nose and migrates into the brain, where it feeds on brain cells.
the legionella attacked the parasite. That's why the disease slowed down.
is it treatable?
we started him on an antiparasitic, and the amoebas will clear out of his system.
and he'll be okay?
then--then we'll wean him out of the coma
will he be okay?
there'll be no lasting damage from the parasite.
but the surgery?
we don't know.
how are you feeling?
can you talk?
I don't feel anything.
are you numb?
no, I--I mean...
I don't feel any pain.
keep your head still. Follow my finger.
I'm okay.
your breath stinks. And you're peeing into a bag.
what are our names?
you did the biopsy?
thank you.
names?
my dad.
and the manipulative bastard.
you remembered.
how you doing, dad?
great.
relieved. Great.
what did I have?
Naegleria.
biopsy showed the amoeba. Cdc autopsy eventually found the amoeba.
and house found it in the water on the cop's roof.
wiggle your left toes.
wait, wait.
you went back and she did the biopsy?
your left toes, Foreman.
I just did.
no, you didn't.
he can't move his toes?
he can move them.
raise your right arm.
what?
Hey, guys!
guess he got away.
can baby shoes come out to play?
come on.
hands on your head, climb out.
I can't climb out if my hands are on my head.
just keep 'em where i can see 'em, man.
go 'head. Go 'head. Come on.
you high, popo?
Yeah, man.
catchin' morons makes me high.
take your shirt off by your collar and turn around.
whoo, would you look at that!
dude's got a weapon.
all right, you have the right to remain...stupid!
watch the gun.
anything you say will be completely incomprehensible.
seriously, man, careful!
seriously, man? Seriously?
your mama know what you do?!
Aww...that's sweet.
your dad's proud. You made the local paper. -- From my article.
give it a rest.
you read what he wrote in the margin?
our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.
he's not proud of me. He's proud of jesus.
everything I do right is god's work.
everything I do wrong is my own damn fault.
cop with a sense of humor.
differential diagnosis.
guy's in the E. R.Bleeding on everybody.
drugs?
he's a cop.
good point. How about...drugs?
tox screen was clean.
he did, however, get hit by a bullet.
just mentioning it.
he was shot?
no, somebody threw it at him.
I'm thinking trauma. He's got bullet fragments lodged in his brain.
according to baby shoes, the cop was laughing before he got shot.
baby shoes?
guy who shot him. -- Reliable witness.
his name is baby shoes. How bad can he be?
fragments are in the wrong part of the brain to cause euphoria.
so let's expand the search. Factor in the cough and the cloudy lungs.
why are we ignoring the elevated heart rate? -- 'Cause he's in shock.
what if the heart was already fast before he got shot?
you mean after the foot race?
he's giddy. Indicates a blockage of oxygen.
carbon monoxide gas would elevate the heart rate and cause coughing and impair neurological functions.
he got co poisoning outdoors?
Yeah.
all 'cause those bastards didn't ratify kyoto.
or he got co poisoning indoors and moved outdoors before he'd inhaled enough to make him drop dead.
test his arterial blood gas. If his carboxy hemoglobin levels are higher than 15%, stick him in a hyperbaric chamber.
you go check the cop car for gas leaks or if it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.
well, maybe she is she just doesn't have as good a sense of humor.
also check his personal cars, work, home.
I'll check the precinct.
blood tests confirm you have low-level carbon monoxide poisoning.
we're putting you inside a high-pressure chamber to...
you don't really care, do you?
do you live near a gas supply?
uh, yeah, me.
after, like, a huge enchilada.
anything toxic you have at your home?
any paint solvents, anything unhygienic?
uh, no.
no, I keep a pretty clean home.
if you start having trouble breathing, you can press this button, and the chamber will decompress.
like this?
don't now. If you have trouble.
Ah, it's broken.
all right, well, if you have problems we'll push it for you.
muscle contracture.
how bad does it hurt?
not...not at all.
looks wild, though, huh?
your brain's not getting enough oxygen. You're losing motor function.
we should start this right away.
should I be scared?
no, you probably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place.
we have a guy there checking things out.
sounds okay.
how about the gas intake valve?
looks great.
it's down in the furnace room.
your system's fine.
if you had a carbon monoxide leak, half the force would be sick.
then why are you here?
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
Yeah. I've, uh...I've got a disability.
these are speeding tickets.
a lot of emergencies.
he's feeling better now, but...you never know.
I'll see what we can do.
Where's your partner sit?
place is a cesspool, but I don't think I need to test for anything.
Nope, waste of time.
you know about the marijuana?
I've heard rumors since junior high.
the cop's acting high because he is high.
he's got -- egionnaires' disease.
it's a good thing Joe got shot.
the whole precinct would have got wiped out. Anarchy on the streets.
takes 48 hours to test for legionnaire'S.
and only two seconds to recognize if the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an ac unit.
marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.
pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.
why don't we agree to disagree?
actually, why don't we agree that you'll disagree with me while treating him for legionnaire's? It's not as pithy, but...
I feel a lot better. The meds are working.
heart rate's normal. Cohp levels are down. No fever.
take some deep breaths.
you seem disappointed.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
you got a problem with cops?
please don't talk.
in my experience, people who just don't like cops have a reason
I need you not to talk.
no rales.
these clouded areas of the upperobes...they're the infiltrates we found yesterday.
not there anymore?
they're clearing up. You had legionnaire'S.
now you don'T.
so you didn't, um...you didn't find anything at my place?
Nothing...medically relevant.
so there's, uh...there's nothing I need to worry about, then?
not this time.
whatcha doing?
I want to make sure he sees what's involved.
what we found was fairly advanced.
these cloudy areas here, and here.
these parts of your lungs simply weren't functioning.
they're okay now, right?
everything's okay now?
I'm fine.
you're blind.
I bumped into something. That doesn't mean I can't see.
I'm sure it's frightening, but you only think what's dr. Cameron wearing?
dark blue pants, white shirt. Black shoes.
Ooh, almost. 'Cept for the pants, shirt, and shoes. You're blind.
he really thinks he can see?
he can physically see. His brain just can't process it.
no chance this is a practical joke?
no way.
Anton's blindness indicates damage to both occipital lobes.
must be from the trauma.
bullet fragments just happen to hit the same spot in both lobes?
stroke could cause anton's blindness and euphoria.
office krupke is clotting in his brain.
start heparin to thin the blood, find the clot, and yank it out.
clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertibral arteries.
great. Chase...stick your fingers in there, grope around till you find it.
Oh, wait...when you turn him into a vegetable, then there's gonna be frivolous lawsuits.
you know what would be better? Contrast mri.
do we have one of those?
you can't do an mri. If the bullet fragment's magnetic, they'll move and rip his brain apart.
well, let's flip a coin.
heads, mri; tails, he dies.
the police issue kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet, they would just catch it.
so the bullet shattered on its own.
meaning baby shoes was using 0. 38 caliber hollow points.
which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.
it's just so cool that you know that.
we could do an angio to find the clotting.
waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We'll never get a decent view.
next best thing to an mri. -- And a waste of time.
angio might show -- oh, god, it's a coup!
fine! Go do your angio.
when you're do wasting your time, meet me down in the morgue.
we're going to snake a catheter in your femoral artery and up into your brain so we can check for clots.
keep this on throughout the procedure.
unless the pot's already made you sterile.
I have a stressful job. You got no idea.
I grew up with cops like you.
one part bully, nine parts hypocrite.
what is wrong with you?
just having some fun.
that man is sick and scared.
the man's a crooked cop.
maybe you should take yourself off the case, Foreman.
don't have to like someone to be their doctor.
Hey, how you doing there, buddy?
just sit still and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time.
happy?
what did the angio tell us?
what are you looking for?
I called my mom. She didn't pick up.
what did the angio tell us?
that foreman should be off this case.
he's a neurologist.
unless you think the patient's optic nerve is in his spleen...
he doesn't like cops.
Foreman, policemen are our friends.
if you and I ever get separated shopping,
I was just busting the guy's chops.
see? -- He was just busting the guy's chops.
foreman is essential to solving this case.
medically, what did the angio tell us?
appears to be some clotting, possibly around the circle of willis.
based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing.
we need to cut into.
saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam ahead.
is it a 10-car pileup or just a really slow bus in the center lane?
and if it is a bus, is it a thrombotic bus of an embolic bus?
think I pushed that metaphor too far.
angio can't tell us that kind of information.
Oh, so you're saying it's just a waste of time.
it gave us some information without killing him.
you don't know that an mri will kill him.
the bullets have a ferrous base!
little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere.
maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.
surgeons say inoperable, or the patient's on blood thinners.
other than that, perfect planning.
you got a better plan?
much.
bullets identical to the one that baby shoes popped Joe with.
let's see how magnetic it is.
I shot him. He's dead.
the bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.
only used a half load of gunpowder.
we won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an mri.
how unprofessional was Foreman?
as him yourself. He's right here.
worse than usual. Better than you.
he berated Joe for being a bad cop.
berated or humiliated?
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.
one implies that he took pleasure in it.
I wanna know if it was repressed black anger or just giddiness.
you think I'm sick?
I think that an appropriate response to watching your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.
but the fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.
Dr. Foreman, dr. Chase requests your assistance.
I can't even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.
well, if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork.
then it won't be a problem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer patient has a bullet hole in his head?
the man donated his body to science.
Yes, it's a tragedy. If I hadn't shot him, his body could have spent the next year letting first-year med students use the carpool lane.
he's set.
do not turn that on, House.
you're mad because I put a bullet in his head.
at worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.
my bad.
they have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it.
MRI is gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.
well, it doesn't matter.
we obviously can't use it on this patient.
No...but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other patients.
that helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment.
I'm sure i'm pulling my weight.
is doing nothing an option?
I'm just saying. Maybe the clot will break up on its own.
the giddiness seems to have gone away.
the blindness hasn'T.
echo his heart.
looking for what? The problem is obviously neurological.
the clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be.
do a complete transthoratic echocardiogram.
maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.
heart's clean.
where else can we look?
we could ultrasound his legs, look for a dvt.
I need you to move over.
Joe? You okay?
tachycardia. Heart rate 150 and rising.
he's bleeding out.
house wanted to thin his blood. Sure did a good job.
bp's crashing. He's going into shock.
intracranial bleeding. We need to relieve the pressure.
we need a surgical team.
Foreman, get out!
boy, is he screwed!
we clot his blood, he dies. We thin it, he dies.
am I the only one who finds this funny?
Oh, man.
I'm not sick!
did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure? Hilarious!
someone laughs, they're dying? That's absurd.
but not funny.
if I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source.
I'll get sick, prove you right.
if you're not sick, it's not contagious. You've got nothing to worry about.
if you are sick, the two of you are staying in there until we find that why.
so you might want to make friends with the pig.
good news is I can finally get my mri.
no, you can't!
you blew up the machine!
not the portable one, chuckles.
chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet-riddled head.
Wh-where are you going?
to the office. Got work to do.
eat your meals.
take your temperature every half hour and any meds i command you to take.
so I'm just a regular patient now?
no.
you get your own thermometer.
check your blood.
anyone with an elevated sed rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie.
he should be a part of this.
he's a patient.
he's not irrational. -- He's not objective.
he's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.
right, you're not even friends with him. Why would you care?
there's an area of increased t2 attenuation in the cingulate cortex.
kind of...mushy.
cingulate cortex controls emotions.
this mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what's causing the mush?
question you might want to ask a neurologist.
foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.
this is why he shouldn't be here.
you wouldn't call him a jerk if he was here.
if you think he screwed up at that apartnt, you'd keep it to yourself.
no, I--well, we'll never know.
but as long as he's not here, he's just like any other patient.
which means we can dumpn him all we want.
what's eating the selfish jerk's brain?
west nile or eastern equine encephalitis--test Foreman's blood.
given that he's the only one who got it, person-to-person transmission is less likely than some sort of deadly toxin foreman picked up at the guy's home.
who wants to go next?
you're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy who doesn't consider you a friend.
he's just a patient, right? It's the job.
hey...you don't have to go anywhere.
Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab.
foreman brought back samples of everything.
what was that, "who wants to go next?"
some kind of...test?
don't worry. You made the right call.
foreman stumbled into whatever it is without knowing.
he's way smarter than you are.
damn, chase!
you suck at this.
sorry, it's this damn suit.
I can do it myself. And I'll throw that out.
What'd the mri show?
I can't be a part of the differential, and I can't even know what the differential is?
you'd tell any other patient what you found out.
MRI showed a lesion on your cingulate cortex.
what's the thinking?
toxins are in the lead.
Viral's a distant second.
do you think the lesion could be an abscess?
it's just a small, soft area, more mush than
was there inflammation in the lining of the ventricles?
there was an increased signal there, yeah.
what are you thinking?
staph infection.
toxins lead to neurodegeneration, which causes the lesion.
not without a fever.
the cop had a fever.
mine could be coming. I could have got it directly from him, or a dirty dish towel at his place.
give us omaya reservoirs. Deliver linezolid directly into our brains.
and we're cured.
samples tested negative for toluene, arsenic, and lead.
what about the blood?
negative for west nile and eastern equine.
we have to go back to Joe's apartment.
no one goes back to that place till we know what we're looking for.
get some of that cop tape. Stick it over the doors and the windows.
I'll take all the hazmat precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.
I was never that great at math.
but next to nothing is...higher than nothing, right?
it's not your fault he got sick.
it would be his fault if we did.
we should get a sample directly from Joe's brain.
we can't do a biopsy.
there's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.
well, I don't think this is the time to be pointing fingers.
I didn't give Foreman any.
you want to give foreman a brain biopsy?
come on, really, who doesn't?
this could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.
without a fever? Not a chance.
Joe had a fever. -- He also had legionella.
the mush might be forming an abscess.
and since there was inflammation of the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense.
the staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.
this is a waste of time.
we should put an omaya reservoir in foreman's brain and start administering anti
if I'm gonna be arguing with foreman, I may as well do it directly.
Kernig's sign, negative.
Brudzinski's sign, single positive.
patient Joe Luria, distal and proximal arm contractures, duration four seconds.
staph infection most commonly presents on the skin.
most commonly?
you wanna treat me like any other patient, do it.
but the House I know never uses phrases like "most commonly."
you're not laughing anymore.
no.
think that's a good thing?
sorta doubt it.
staph would be in your heart, lungs, spleen, liver, or kidneys before it gets to your brain.
your organs are clear. It's not staph.
the infection could be limited to a brain abscess.
which I would have seen in your mri.
sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
let me see the mri.
there was no abscess on the image.
let me see it, then.
I liked you better when you were jolly.
MRI was taken over an hour ago.
that soft spot could now be an abscess.
if it was staph, you'd have a fever. Which you don't!
what idiot gave you that?
put the omaya reservoir in my skull and treat me for the staph.
triangle.
this one?
Uh...circle.
next.
Foreman, why aren't you answering? Is there a problem?
uh, s-square.
tell me your date of birth.
is that House? -- Yeah. Next.
a square again. Why is he here?
because my neurologist is having surgery.
thought I was just another patient.
you didn't believe that crap, did you?
date of birth.
the omaya reservoir is inserted in the parietal lobe.
my spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.
did you say omaya?
I could have sworn you said biopsy.
Hey, I'm just messing with your head.
mother's maiden name, please.
get out of my temporal lobe, House.
Hello?
are you awake?
they told me somebody was sick like me.
I'm up.
your voice...
aren't you my doctor?
not anymore.
you're the guy who doesn't like cops.
Yeah.
can you see?
you can't?
not a thing.
you've been blind a while.
the fact that you're aware of it now...
it could be a sign of improvement.
it hurts so much. Doesn't it?
I'm okay.
it's gonna hurt.
the morphine barely takes the edge off.
I'm gonna die, aren't I?
you die, I die. It's not gonna happen.
why not?
you're just too stubborn to die?
they took a piece of my brain.
whatever's wrong with us...they'll find.
do you believe in prayer?
not really.
neither do I.
my dad always prays.
so does mine.
do you wanna try it?
try prayin'?
okay.
how is he?
still dying.
well, you've almost mastered another skill, though. That's good.
Foreman's biopsy results.
non-specific signs of inflammation.
that's it?
we also swabbed for staph. Negative. He's not even a carrier.
well, at least Foreman was wrong too.
Yeah, there's that.
can I go to Joe's apartment now?
no.
go back to the lab.
start retesting all the samples that foreman collected.
for what?
everything.
bacteria, toxins, fungus. Anything that likes to feast on brain.
that's thousands of.
better hurry.
cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor Foreman.
he's on to hand contractures. He'll be in anton's blindness soon.
run hourly checks, because when he does go blind, he won't be able to tell us.
we'll use the data to construct a timeline so we can see how far behind Joe he is.
why are you still here?
you're being cautious.
you're being...common.
when you don't give a crap about
how many of your guys have caught cancer from their patients?
let me know when that happens. Then we can have this conversation.
it's just another case, huh?
gee, I bet you can even have unprotected sex with your cancer patients without catching a damn thing.
boy, I wish I had your job.
biopsy showed nothing.
how can there be nothing? You cut out a piece of my brain.
it's nothing personal. We just didn't find anything.
can you up his morphine for god's sake?
he's already maxed out, 20 milligrams per hour.
what about toxins?
everything was negative.
there was a cupboard above the stove. Did you see it?
I didn't check all the food, but could be listeriosis.
we didn't go back. Follow right.
who did?
house said we shouldn't go. Too dangerous.
the answer's gotta be in that apartment. Not going is too dangerous!
I'm sorry.
you're thankful.
if House would have pointed at you instead of me, you'd be the one in here.
look straight forward, tell me when you can see
it's your job to go back! You're a doctor! You go where the disease is!
say when you can see the light.
I'm dying, and you're sitting here measuring how fast I go?
tell me when you can see the light!
my vision's fine!
your left-side periphery is reduced.
it's fine, I'll prove it.
Ow! Son of a bitch!
now we're both exposed.
you got two choices.
you can go tell House what just happened and get your own cot board in here, or you can go back to that apartment...
you save me, the cop, and yourself.
it's not sspe. I checked your past vaccinations against joe'S. No batch matches.
blood show antibodies for coxsackievirus?
guys, could you please shut him up?
he's over his limit on morphine.
Where's cameron?
she said she has some stuff to do. Said she'd be back soon.
what are you doing?
stop! I can't take it!
imagine being constantly reminded of the...pain you're about to be in.
I can't take it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, stop it.
mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!
so could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy.
either the morphine kills him or the pain does. -- You're condoning this?!
I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
that'll make you feel better.
Joe has a new symptom. Hyperalgesia.
the infection's spreading to the pain center of the brain.
make it stop! Make it stop!
his brain's telling him that his whole body's in pain, and because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.
suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
what if he used cedarwood to hide the pot smell?
Aureobasidium fungus could grow there.
did you find any cedarwood anywhere?
no, but maybe--maybe what?
maybe somebody could go back, take a second look?
and why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?
why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.
God, you're weak.
guy steals your article...
tells you you're not his friend...
and you still want to risk your life for him.
foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.
Yeah.
God, you're weak. Guy tried to kill you.
first thing on my list of things to do would be to stab him back. Shoot him.
I've got a gun in my desk.
last thing on my list would be to lie to my boss about it and then give the bastard everything he wanted.
I'm not here for foreman. I'm here to save myself.
even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim.
that's why you're wearing the suit.
you wanted to be here.
he just gave you the excuse.
what does that guy have to do to make you hate him?
give me the bag.
mildewed dish towel. -- To retest for staph.
what is that, mouse droppings?
hamster droppings. Could carry toxocara. Explain the blindness.
now, that I recognize as oven crud.
could be meat with trichinella. Would explain the high fever.
what's with rye bread?
mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning, which would explain the contractures.
there are three loaves. -- So?
you're going back in there.
guy who lives on take-out pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
that's looking too far into the future.
unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.
you on the roof yet?
Yeah, I'm here. I don't see any birds.
whistle or something.
do that come hither thing.
they came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
now look down. You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh...no. There's barely any.
it's not weird, it's cheap.
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.
probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
you see a shovel or a dustpan?
Mmm, found a scraper. Looks used.
sitting on a bucket.
bucket full of pigeon crap. Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain.
let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
don't cut corners when you're growing your pot. See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time.
get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation. Haven't heard from House yet.
look at his eeg.
theta band's been increasing steadily since--since we put him under.
guy's unconscious, but still in pain.
theta bands could indicate at least half a dozen different things.
one of which is pain.
the fact that he's no longer screaming makes us feel better, not necessarily him.
chase! How's cameron?
she's not giddy.
fever's down. White count's improving.
has she said anything to you?
you mean like, "I completely understand why foreman did what he did, and I hold no grudge?"
what I did...did save my life.
get in here and help! Forget the suit!
he's tachycardic! Wide-complex looks like v-tach!
it's not cryptococcus!
what? -- House was wrong. The samples were negative.
so what is it?
we don't know! -- Give him in the amio.
do we have any more leads?
that was our lead! Foreman!
so the treatment isn't doing anything.
Foreman! He's in v-fib!
no good. Hit him again.
come on, man. Come on, Joe.
hit him again!
give him an amp of epi!
nothing!
he's has multiple-system failure.
come on, Joe.
Foreman! Time of death.
no.
time of death.
here you go.
that fried crap will kill you.
see?
time to make the donuts.
hands in the air! Right now!
get up! Move out here, let's go! Move it!
purses and wallets on the counter! Right now!
your watches, your jewelry. Take it all off!
get the girl, get the girl.
we're moving to the back room. Let's go!
let's go! Move it!
go on!
not you.
Hey, hey!
no, no. She's staying right here.
you're not gonna do this.
whoa, kid.
no, no. Jeremy, please. Just do what they say. Please.
okay, okay.
move!
son of a bitch! You thought I was gonna let you hurt my wife?
Hey, mister! Your wife.
what did he do to her?
nothing.
20-year-old, married african american female.
couldn't breathe. Anaphylaxis-like throat swelling.
children?
you think pregnancy would explain
it explains the marriage.
who the hell gets married at 20?
I'm guessing people in love.
show me a 20 year-old who's not in love.
you get married at 20, you're gonna be shocked at who you're living with at 30.
it's not allergies, negative on all the skin tests.
four days on antihistamines and steroids
who's he talking to? --What?
it's got an ass.
technically, that makes it a "who."
new nurse in peeds.
Wendy something.
swelling just started to go down
seen her here before?
couple times.
I tried following her home, but she gave me the slip.
swelling's
think that's funny ask him about the time he sabotaged my cane.
are you serious?
there was a point to it. Wendy, this is House.
something about not getting too "uppity" with normal folks who walk good.
you're everything I'd heard.
nice to meet you.
why so rude?
you've sprinted through three bad marriages into an affair with a dying patient. Now a naughty nurse?
how many more failed relationships are we both gonna have to deal with before you learn to love yourself?
and I mean that in the literal way.
it's amazing how you can not only know it's a relationship, but that it's a bad relationship based on nothing but...
nothing.
I know you.
I'm not with her. Not even trying.
you're lying to me.
that's interesting.
well, as long as it's interesting.
swelling is
why is she hanging out here?
anyone interested in what happened with the swelling?
she's in peeds.
it's the next wing over.
if you're wondering if Wilson's dating her, ask Wilson.
clearly he did. And wilson denied it.
and house doesn't believe it.
it's gotta hurt.
that's why it pays to have more than one friend, House.
if he's not hitting that, why is she here?
because I'm hitting that and it's totally hot.
swelling took four days to resolve.
patient has unexplained, intense abdominal pains.
so explain them.
wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy.
anybody know her? Know her story?
up and at 'em. They did a laparotomy.
liver, bowel, gallbladder, appendix--all clean.
belly pain plus throat swelling.
she was in some sort of assault, right?
simple neck trauma.
it says no one touched her neck, and if they did, it would resolve by now.
didn't need to touch her. Some guy coughed on her, right?
he's in jail and he's completely healthy, except for the broken head he got from the beating he took.
there's pot on her tox screen.
salmonella from the pot would explain the stomach pains.
it's a stretch. She'd have a fever.
she's on steroids for the swelling therefore no fever.
and the smoking explains the throat.
sorry, take it back.
that's a stretch.
got a better idea?
then stretch away.
start her on fluoroquinolone for the salmonella.
I was waiting two hours out there.
fascinating.
have you considered a career as a memoirist?
let's see it.
you don't introduce yourself?
sorry, I thought you were waiting two hours, didn't know you wanted to chat.
Hi, I'm Greg. How about that local sports team?
it's not an infection.
how can you tell without you want me to touch you?
it's your private place.
you're chewing nicotine gum which causes dehydration which causes wear and tear.
try a lubricant.
or foreplay if you're cheap.
just take a swab and get it tested, okay?
sorry.
I already met this month's quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots.
you're rude.
wow, you're like a detective, or something.
and you're smart.
and you're funny.
but you are bitter, and you're lonely.
so you treat everyone around like they're idiots.
and you get away with it, 'cause of your cane.
please stop.
it's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears.
but you're not actually getting away with it.
last nurse you made fun of she probably slipped some crap into your coffee.
Nah, I asked forde-crappinated coffee.
treat people like jerks you get treated like a jerk.
thank you.
bend over.
you kidding me?
if you have an infection, you'd have a fever.
you're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to vacation elsewhere.
and wait till I put the thermometer in.
you break it, you bought it.
leaving early today.
you ever get that thing where you're sure you forgot something, but you can't figure out what?
guess it can't be that important.
salmonella is a bacterial infection at you can get from pot plants.
causes stomach pain.
and my throat?
the thinking is it's an inflammatory reaction to the smoking.
how much would you need to smoke for your throat to go nuts like that?
most cases, a lot.
we don't smoke a lot.
let's just start the treatment.
think we're liars as well as druggies?
actually, I'm wondering if you'd mind getting her a cup of ice chips.
you're not gonna get any different answer from her.
no, no. He can stay.
no offense, but this place is scary.
I feel better when he's around.
Tracy, I need to talk to you.
we don't do a lot of drugs.
I need to know your answers aren't being pressured.
look, if you think the antibiotics are a good idea, you can give them to me.
okay.
worst case scenario, it'll help us rule out a few things.
he's a good guy.
he just has a hard time holding in his emotions.
you don't have to apologize for me.
that mean you're gonna do it for yourself?
I got nothing to apologize for.
he's young.
itchy.
allergic reaction to the fluoroquinolone.
we should switch to a different antibiotic.
Why?
we can't treat the salmonella unless salmonella? That was a total stretch.
man, why does that sound so familiar?
you think it's 'cause I said it an hour ago?
then it was a dumb thing to say. Now it's smart.
she's got the rash, so we know she's unusually susceptible to allergic reactions.
so that's what brought her in.
probably the peanut butter in her sandwich.
stick test was negative for peanuts.
that's because you foolishly tested her while she was lying down.
Exercise-based anaphylaxis?
I think that requires exercise.
when her throat closed, they'd just got done eating.
not evencompetitive eating.
and getting robbed.
always gets my heart rate up.
give her the same food she ate at the dinner and stick her on the treadmill.
better yet, put a gun to her head threaten to rape her.
you don't think I'm gonna get a response?
no.
you're on. 50 bucks.
I'm not betting on a patient's
100 bucks. If you say so.
Tracy, I'm increasing the speed a little.
my stomach really hurts.
Jeremy! You out there?
talk to me!
you're doing great.
isn't this enough?
I'm not getting anyallergic response yet.
come on. Shut it off.
we don't complete the test, my boss will just come down here and do it himself.
you do not want that.
she's in pain. Look at her.
I don't want to have to ask you to leave.
you're gonna ask me to leave? Are you kidding me?
this is my wife. You guys aren't helping her.
you're just hurting her.
what? You guys have all this equipment in here and you're not doing anything.
you guys can't figure out what's
ow, it hurts!
where?
in my stomach. And my chest.
it's Foreman. Get me a wheel chair.
he's as sick as she is now.
told you it would work.
worked on the wrong patient.
we could spend all day arguing right or wrong.
give me the 100 bucks.
we didn't bet.
we could spend all day arguing whether we bet or not.
give me the 100 bucks.
come on, Foreman. Pay up, he won.
or we could just never finish the DDX.
husband's test showed no MI.
no aortic dissection. It's not his heart.
it's just non-specific chest and abdominal pain.
so, psychosomatic? Panic attack?
pain persisted after he got lorazepam and morphine.
whose locker is that?
mine.
chest, stomach, throat. What does it all mean?
we're in the nurses'locker room.
I know that.
that is so annoying.
Wilson's girlfriend's left her stuff in my locker again.
great, I hadn't committed any felonies yet today.
relax. You know who they're gonna blame.
house, you wanna mess with Wilson, no problem.
but you got no reason to screw around
can we get back to the medicine?
okay.
why assume one disease?
his chest, her throat.
so it's just a coincidence that they both got crippling stomach pains.
wow, they really area great couple. So much in common.
one blue shoe. What do you think that means?
it means you're insane. Wilson's not dating her.
you feeling luckier?
does it matter what I answer?
200 it is.
if they're married and caught the same disease, then it means they
brochure to a jazz festival in the poconos this weekend.
Wilson likes jazz. Foreman, pay the man.
four, five, six novels. No music. What does that mean?
she's literate.
it means she spends her leisure time reading, not listening.
she'd only wanna go watch jazz if the other person wanted to go.
she has a martyr complex. Issues of inferiority.
married couple. Same disease.
they either got it from each other or in the same place.
infectious or environmental.
all we have to do is check out parasites, viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, radiation, toxins, chemicals, or it's internet porn related.
I'll check the internet.
you guys cover the rest of the stuff.
if they can live here without killing each other, they must really be in love. It's tiny.
how come it's taking you so long to search it?
box of condoms in his jacket.
I know you're poor now, but buy your own.
she's on the pill.
why would he need condoms?
no, put that back.
Why?
we show that to House, he'll just call the guy a cheating bastard.
look how he is with Wilson.
he'd be right. Could be an STD.
one that doesn't give them any symptoms in their sexual organs?
they never mentioned anything.
maybe they're embarrassed.
what else could it be?
you think they just like the sexy feel of latex against their genitals?
maybe the wife just wants to be extra cautious.
come on, you really believe that?
Yeah. --Good.
then I'm sure you'll have no problem convincing House.
that cheating bastard. --He loves her.
right.
I bet he told you that she's the love of his life.
people lie, I get it.
but they don't go up against two armed gunmen to save someone unless they really
there's a reason that we don't let kids vote or drink or work in the salt mines.
they're idiots.
20-year-olds falling and out of love more often than they change their oil filters, which they should do more often.
sorry. Ridiculous of me to draw a conclusion based on actually observing them.
should have just depended on your misanthropic view of human nature.
gonorrhea explains all their symptoms.
Fitzhugh-curt is syndromefor her belly pain, costochondritis and bladder infection for his chest and abdominal pain.
good.
now go rub their lying, cheating privates with a cotton swab.
why would you want to look at her?
is this because of the condoms?
you found them in his jacket, figured he was hiding something from me.
I thought I was pregnant last month. Kind of freaked me out.
I'm way too young to have kids.
so you just wanted to be extra cautious.
wish one of ushad figured that out, stuck to his guns.
we're still gonna check you both.
she's the only girlfriend I've ever had. She's the love of
please don't say it.
I can't say I love my wife?
we're still gonna test you.
what is it, I'm white?
Yeah, that's it.
Jeremy, I wish you would stop it. You're really embarrassing.
everybody thinks they're so liberal, but I see how they look at us.
white and black.
especially black.
I'm sorry, trace, but it's true.
great. Prove us all wrong.
no scarring, no purulent discharge and the NAATs were negative.
they don't have an STD.
what's that you say?
you got a problem with interracial couples?
thank you, Chase.
no. Any of your shorties ever been whities?
not sure I understand your ghetto slang, Dr. House.
how many black women have you dated, by the way?
I don't care about color.
as long as they can help me breed a superior race.
Yeah, my exes have usually been black. So what?
it's not a racial thing. It's cultural.
I have more in common with them.
like I assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.
sorry, you're right.
that kind of prejudiceis totally fine.
the abdominal painis getting worse.
we've had to up their morphine twice.
take the wife off the steroids.
if she spikes a fever, we'll know it's an infection.
if she doesn't, it's environmental.
he got off easy.
I almost gave him a colonos copy.
that was one of the stupidest things you have ever done and there is heavy competition for
what are you doing?
only ate half your breakfast.
feeling a little sick this morning?
I'm not pregnant. They burnt my omelet.
you need to apologize to this guy.
I'm a man of principle.
I don't care how much time and money it costs you to defend me.
he wants to kill you.
no empty coffee cups. Off the caffeine.
good for baby.
cups are in the other waste basket, baby's in your mind.
you can berate patients all you want shoving objects into their rectums is assault.
pay attention to me.
sorry, that would make it harder to ignore you.
can't ignore that rapidly expanding first trimester ass, though.
sometimes an assis just an ass.
you are not always right, House.
apologize to the guy.
what are you doing here?
stay away from my son.
how did you find us?
stay away from that girl.
leave him alone!
what happened?
she's dreaming. She started yelling.
you're breaking Jeremy's arm!
no one's hurting him.
baby, it's me. It's Jeremy.
she's okay.
baby, it was just a bad dream. Everything's okay.
it was an acutdelirium.
well, she's talking, right?
I mean, she's coming out of it.
she's not really talking.
just making sounds.
okay, when is she gonna come out?
she's in a coma.
so her vitals are pretty stable.
but her response to stimulis getting weaker which means the coma is getting worse.
her brain is slowly shutting down.
can I see her?
we're getting some more images to check for masses or infections.
I'll increase your morphine.
her hallucination.
if you knew what it was would that make any difference?
medically, I mean.
not usually.
some cases, the form of a hallucination can tell us what part of the brain is being hit.
I think it was about my dad.
your...your dad was breaking your arm?
he was a drunk, pill-popping racist.
he caught me sneaking into her house when we were 13.
she lived next door.
he broke my arm and threatened her.
we ran off when we were 16.
you still in touch with him?
killed himself a couple of years ago.
it's not medical, I just thought blacks were the racist ones.
some generalized edema throughout.
and areas of increased signal here, here, here, and here.
damn. All over her brain stem.
could be plaques, maybe hyperdensities from the edema.
or tumors or anything.
we add brain involvement to the chest, stomach, throat. What do we got?
didn't spike a fever when we took off the steroids, so it's not an infection.
leaving environmental. What flavor?
environmental doesn't make sense either.
if it's a toxin, we'd see it in their livers.
none of the neighbors are sick, no co-workers
they both got it.
means infection or environmental and since it's not an infection...
what if they didn't both get it?
maybe we got our basic assumption wrong, and it's two different diseases.
maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis.
sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.
tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.
fire fighters and residents of pine tar forests?
I did see these two putting out that blaze in the pine barrens.
if sarcoidosis has two environmental causes it has environmental causes.
we just don't know all of them yet.
husband's chest.
he has slightly enlarged hilar lymphnodes.
sarcoidosis explains almost all of their symptoms.
including her getting worse off the steroids.
doesn't explain his throat swelling.
that's what "almost" means.
90% of sarcoidosis cases have lung scarring.
Oh, "almost."
fine.
consult a specialist.
if this is more dating advice...
love to gossip, but I got work to do.
this sarcoidosis?
it's pretty non-specific.
could be granulomas, could be plaques. What's this?
Oh, oh. You stole wendy'spersonnel file?
in a way, aren't we all guilty of bribing the janitor to take her file and give it to me?
Yes, I take my share of the blame.
but society's
first of all, I'm not dating her.
she is so wrong for you.
you know, she filed a form so the hospital would take extra withholding.
who does that?
she's much too cautious for me. Point taken.
I'll start dating her, so I can break up with her and start dating a stripper.
you're a miserable jerk who can't stand to be alone.
I didn't try to break up your marriages.
you did that yourself.
my marriages were so crappy I was spending all my time with you.
your real fear is me having a good relationship.
Yes. It keeps me up at night.
that, and the loch ness monster global warming, evolution, and other fictional concepts.
although, big romantic weekend in the poconos could change everything.
you don't mean...no.
I don't think it's sarcoidosis.
he says it's sarcoidosis.
start them both on methotrexate and if you're wrong?
if Wilson's wrong...
we'll biopsy her just to be sure.
her brain stem?
brain damage is not only possible, it's likely.
good point.
let's biopsy something safer. Like her shoes.
the husband, he'd have to give consent.
he can't right now.
Why? This guy write with his stomach?
he has a conflict of interest.
it's not his brain we're cutting open.
but he still gets all the benefit.
he'd do it just to save himself.
or save her.
she's the love of his life, remember?
he never said that.
she needs a guardian ad litem.
I can't let you do this.
how are you gonna stop me?
call cuddy?
cameron's right. There's a conflict.
no, there isn'T.
not unless one of them wants to die a horrible painful death.
I'm sure the guardian will figure that out.
in a couple days.
will the guardian convince the disease to hold off eating her brain so we can get the legalities worked out?
I just don't want some plaintiff's lawyer owning my hospital.
legalities help.
speaking of which, did you get your thermometer back yet?
Oh, we had a nice chat.
did you know he's a rotarian?
listen, she'll die without the biopsy.
I need to cover the hospital's ass.
you're too biased.
I send you in there, you'll steam roll over him.
something goes wrong, he'll sue us for not disclosing the risks.
then have Wilson talk to the husband.
Wilson kills people left and right no one ever sues him.
fine.
but only if you apologize to the clinic guy.
probably better to just let that couple die.
I don't care if you mean it just do it.
unfortunately, we don't see any way around a biopsy.
we'll do all we can to minimize any damage.
no.
the methotrexate isn't showing any effects yet.
you could both be
she's brilliant.
all in college while working full time.
I can't do that to her.
and if you both die?
you think she'd want that?
do it on me instead.
it's not in your brain.
it will be.
it's the same disease, right? Do it then.
she could die before you show the symptoms.
then stop treating me.
great job.
why didn't you just shoot him in the head?
hold on. That gives me an idea.
you know what could save this couple?
lots of misdirected sarcasm.
they're dead.
yelling at you might prevent you from screwing up like this again.
I didn't screw up. I did my job.
your job was to get me the biopsy.
he chose a third, no treatment.
how do you even do that?
remember when you used to just weave elaborate conspiracy theories about my love life?
those were such good times.
how much morphineis the husband on?
we can't increase it anymore.
his respirations are depressed.
increase it?
drugs cloud people's judgment.
cold turkey the sucker.
uh... no.
good point.
did I ask you guys to follow me?
no.
which made us nervous.
he'll catch on if he notices he's off the morphine drip.
shoot him up with one of these puppies instead.
no.
you do understand it's not really a puppy.
it's naloxone.
an opiate-blocker?
he'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire.
that's pretty unethical even for you.
how is that unethical? It'll lead to a diagnosis.
it's leading to the torture of the husband on the off-chance he'll allow a procedure on another person.
which will lead to a diagnosis. Didn't I just say that?
give it up.
foreman and Cameron are too ethical and I'm too scared of getting sued.
fine.
I'm just gonna...
find some place safe to hide this.
so I won't be tempted to use it.
you're not doing it either.
what, are you gonna run for it?
if they die now, they'll never be able to grow old and tired of each other.
we can't baby-sit house all day.
I'll tell cuddy to put a nurse by his room.
damn it.
atropine?
what happened to--?
he knew we'd stop him.
he stuck both of them in his pocket.
that's actually pretty clever.
guess I can't use that trick again, huh?
Oh, my stomach!
it was a pretty smart plan, Jerry.
but I'm on to you.
there's only one good reason to kill the biopsy.
you poisoned your wife, and you don't want the coppers to get wise.
No!
Oh, all right.
then you're just a moron.
biopsy me.
only if this thing hits your brain, you moron.
and I can't stress that "moron" part enough.
you're killing your wife.
she is the love of my life.
careful
once she's dead and you're on wife number two, you're gonna feel real guilty about saying that.
feel that?
get used to it.
pain's gonna get a lot worse.
no, it won't.
morphine just isn't working right now for some reason.
I'm putting you on a tranquilizer in the meantime.
it'll work again soon.
wanna bet?
I don't care about the pain.
I need to be in pain because I have to get worse. Means you can do the biopsy on me.
dude, she's in a coma.
who are you trying to impress?
I'd die for her.
give up.
or we can wait for him to get all grown-up and cynical.
I was just gonna call you.
I need a court order to biopsy this woman's brain.
speaking of litigation...
you know Dr. House.
you guys can talk here.
I don't want to sue you.
good.
I wanna beat the crap out of you.
less good.
and I'll tell you why.
you're a bully.
and bullies, they don't back down.
until they run into someone stronger and meaner.
but you'll accept an apology.
Yes.
not really a recipe for sincerity.
I'm not looking for sincerity.
I'm looking for humiliation.
something that will make you think twice before you treat the next patient like crap.
here's what's gonna happen.
you go brag to your friends about how you made the big nasty doctor poop in his pants.
I get Cuddy off my back by telling her that I humiliated myself.
here's the catch
we're both gonna be lying.
I'm not apologizing.
if anything, you deserved a bigger thermometer.
what's wrong?
Jeremy's worse.
then that's what's right.
cut the stubborn jerk's head open and take a slice.
it's not his brain.
lactic acid's up to 39.
his intestines are rotting.
this isn't sarcoidosis.
well, he'll get his wish.
he's dying.
it's just not in a way that's gonna help his wife.
coma's worse. She's losing response to stimuli.
he's vomiting blood, and his lactic acid's 45.
he's gotta have ischemic bel.
so what?
well, let's see, lack of blood flow is causing his guts to die which will cause him to die, unless we cut out a few feet of small intestine and reattach the ends--I don't know.
seems worth a mention.
why does he have it? What does it tell us?
small cell vasculitis?
good, now let's hear it again, but this time with a more environmental or infectious feeling.
or, like I said before, it might not be environmental or infectious.
he has vasculitis. She has porphyria.
belly pain plus hallucinations: Classic symptoms.
could even cause a coma.
fine.
start her on hematin for porphyria.
what about him?
take out the dead bowel.
that's all we can do.
and biopsy it.
if foreman's right, it might save him.
if foreman's wrong, dead bowel might save both of them.
bowel's not dead.
unless he's been tossing down frosty cans of lactic acid, the bowel is dead.
what we're looking for is a reason it's dead.
bowel's not dead.
just general swellingand edema.
high lactate was probably from stress.
we just sliced him openfrom chest to pubic bone for nothing.
nothing is something.
forget the ischemia.
add the edema and swelling.
probably fromcutting him open.
probably, not definitely.
okay, back to the beginning.
what did we talk about?
anything. I wanna hear it all again.
allergies. Doesn't fit at all now.
STDs--maybe we got the wrong one.
what about syphilis?
neurological symptoms--he wasn't cheating on her.
Yeah, yeah,"love of his life."
don't you have to wait until he's dead before you make that determination?
she's his only girlfriend ever.
they grew up next door, they ran off together as teenagers.
Sarcoidosis--we only ruled it out 'cause we though the had ischemic
why did they run off?
what difference does
kids talk about running off. How many do it?
what was the reason?
they were trying to escape his evilpill-popping, racist dad.
you would've liked him.
we should do another biopsy
how do you know the dad was racist?
he beat up his son for dating a black girl.
I extrapolated from that.
you see racism everywhere.
maybe he just didn't like this black girl.
it's not sarcoid. We would have seen granulomas in his
she has pretty eyes.
forget infectious.
forget environmental.
defective DNA is keeping them from making a critical protein.
hence the fluid buildup.
it's the throat, stomach, chest and brain.
Angioedema?
hereditary angioedema.
symptoms fit perfectly.
it's an incredibly rare disease.
they both would have to have a parent
is it a coincidence that your sister has great hair?
or that these two have green eyes?
you're not saying...
they're not brother and sister.
EW. God, no.
that would be sick.
half-brother and sister.
different moms.
dad must have had an affair with her mom.
that's why he flipped out when the kids started dating.
he had it himself.
probably why the pills.
we don't know for sure.
testing for hae or paternity is gonna take a day.
she doesn't have a day.
start treating and see what happens.
any change?
her response to stimuliis still just as weak.
I almost hope she stays in a coma.
that's sweet, Cameron.
I'd like to avoid shattering both of their lives.
you don't think dying will do that?
it's just her oximeter.
she's awake.
Oh, god, baby. It's gonna be okay.
awesome!
can I tell them?
we've obviously got to let them know what's wrong.
but the cause, the brother-sister thing...
good plan.
you just got to keep them away from...
doctors, the Internet, and anyone who's not a total moron.
tell them.
yesterday, he was willing to die to save her.
we've got to give them time to recover.
he might be a little vexed that you kept letting him hump his sister in the meantime.
tell them.
unless their dad was also the product of an incestuous union the chances of serious complications are minimal.
noble of you to take that risk.
tell them or I will.
so we just need to take these pills. --Twice a day.
Angioedema's very treatable. You'll be fine.
so, what?
we, like, caught this from each other?
no.
it's a condition you both always had.
the onset of symptoms are sometimes caused by stress or trauma.
the incident at the diner.
so we got it as kids?
it's, um...
it's a genetic disease.
it's not
there's no good reason two unrelated people would get it.
we think you guys should take a DNA test.
how can we be related?
we think you have the same dad.
we don't know for sure until we do the tests.
Oh, god.
your father...
no, no.
this can't be true.
Yeah, yeah--Jer, Jer, I'm lighter
you know, I'm lighter than both my parents.
and our eyes.
everyone always talks about how we have the same eyes.
you're not really siblings.
we have the same father!
you didn't fight in the backseat on car trips.
you didn't change each other's diapers.
you guys just...
met and fell in love.
the way you feel
that...hasn't changed.
hey Foreman, can you wear the beeper for a couple of hours this weekend?
what?
we just destroyed two people's lives.
I'm not allowed to run errands anymore?
I'd like to see some sign that it affects you, or that you recognize it affects other people.
so are you gonna wearthe beeper or not?
sorry, I can't.
you just want to punish me.
I'm busy.
with what?
I'm going out of town.
where are you going?
you're not missing a blue shoe, are you?
come
you can't bet when you know the answer before hand.
we could spend all day arguing whether you can bet when you know the answer before hand.
give me the 200 bucks.
what?
Hey. Hey.
you okay?
I was just wondering.
you really like jazz?
I love it.
are you lying?
I'm lying.
I want to spend time with you.
is that so terrible?
no.
maybe we shouldn't walk out together.
people see us leaving...
they gotta find out sometime.
let me just meet you at your place.
she got her own room.
she just...needs some time alone.
you want me to hang out here a bit?
if you've come to return the thermometer, don't bother.
I've moved on.
if you'd actually read my chart, you'd have known that I'm a cop.
you were going 40 in a 25 zone.
Oh, come on.
this isn't because I was speeding. This is because I'm latino.
license, registration, proof of insurance.
sorry. Cool jacket.
only pockets for important stuff.
that's a shame.
50 buck ticket.
is that your way of beating me up?
or is that just the price for sticking something in you?
you took a pill while you were... examining a patient.
that's serious addictive behavior.
I'm betting that you're holding right now.
I wasn't weaving, I'm not drunk.
you've got no reason to
pupils dilated.
appeared to be under the influence of a narcotic.
would you mind turning around, please, putting your hands behind your head?
does that polite crapever work on people?
most people...realize there's only one answer.
you got a prescription?
I'm a cripple who works in a hospital.
you don't think I can get a valid prescription?
arrogant son of a bitch like you?
I bet you didn't bother.
you are under arrest...
for possession...of narcotics.
you have the right to remain silent, which you should take advantage of for once in your life.
if you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you...
so you want me to explain how you just lost?
or do you wanna stare at the board your full... three minutes?
cling to hope?
come on. It's called speed chess.
na na na na na na na na hey hey hey good-bye good game.
I said good game.
Hey! Hey hey!
what are you doing? Stop that, son! Stop that!
back away from him. Back away!
call 911. Get an ambulance!
tell them to send two!
my head's gonna explode! Aah!
your head still hurt?
you a moron?
I'm clutching my head in pain, and he asks if it hurts?
what are you, some kind of med student?
you look like you still have theme birthday parties.
sorry.
any problems concentrating in school lately?
besides the dreams of running my tongue along my french teacher's breasts?
no, I'm doing quite great.
the rage and pain could be caused by a parasite. Does he eat a lot of sushi?
no. Uh, he was a vegetarian until just a few months ago.
any changes in behavior since the new diet?
no.
he's been this way since he became a teenager.
it doesn't matter how much I yell or punish, he's still gonna say
Yeah, let's all shed a tear for poor little Nate's mother.
any more stupid questions?
I hate this kid.
I like this kid.
you haven't met him. - I know you hate him.
what more do I need to know? The kid's not a clich?
anybody can get into a fight after losing.
it takes real creativity to beat up someone you just beat.
the pain's not limited to his head.
the rest is bumps and bruises accounted for by the 17 fights he's been in this semester.
concussion?
MRI was clean. No frontal lobe tumor.
and the tox screen showed no trace of coke or amphetamines.
Nate went medieval on the other kid. Could be
hold on. I'm having a moment.
this...
this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.
which could create excess adrenaline. Causes the head pain and rage.
but not the personality disorder.
there is no personality disorder.
he's a teenager.
being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment.
this kid say anything appropriate?
he's having cluster headaches. Probably been having them for years.
question is, what's causing them?
if it were just a cluster headache, he'd have swelling around the eyes.
er gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain.
but it could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular problem.
normal treatment for cluster headaches is steroids, which the ER also gave him.
he's still in pain. Which means
normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment.
start him on blood thinners and give his noggin transcranial magnetic stimulation.
don't you dare... touch that acerbic wit.
50 bucks to whichever of you steps up and treats this brat.
not the kid's fault, he's sick.
fine. You do it.
no way. He's your brat.
I'll do it. But I've got a job interview after work.
anything comes up later, you guys handle it.
need a peer recommendation? - Thanks.
cameron's should suffice.
this isn't gonna turn me into some, like, drooling vegetable that wets his pants, is it?
it's safe. The magnetic pulses activate nerve cells which will hopefully squelch the head pain.
is there anything you can do about the other pain?
from the fights?
Yeah, I mean, my face, my shoulder. My stomach.
I mean, I can barely bend my fingers.
you're already on pain meds. Nothing more I can do.
sure you can, man. Tell your homies to quit stomping on me.
I'll get the word out that you're a great guy.
so, do people watch what they say around you?
because I'm black?
no, because you're gay.
cluster headaches can persist for years, cause irritability or even hostility towards others.
you mean, the illness is affecting his personality?
if these treatments work, it could
change him?
Yeah.
Oh, thank god.
Oh. Oh, you must think I'm awful.
here my son's lying in a hospital bed and
I'm pretty sure I get it.
I thought I was a bad mother.
and I hated myself.
because I hated him.
what have you got for me this fine morning?
blood thinners and TMs had no effect. It's not cluster headaches.
you accusing the symptoms of lying?
could be hemochromatosis.
wouldn't account for the personality disorder.
what about hypothyroidism?
he's not getting aggressive and lethargic, he's getting aggressive and aggressiver.
what about ruptured dermoid CYST?
sorry. Just got dizzy there. I was expecting to turn right.
it's Foreman's turn to be shot down.
the thing that Cameron said.
way to think outside the box.
but no fat in the ventricles.
it's cluster headaches.
normal treatment didn't work. Abnormal treatment didn't work.
good point, Foreman.
the treatments don't always work. Symptoms never lie.
the only approved treatment left for cluster headaches is brain surgery.
and that's not even a guarantee.
back off, Foreman!
if the approved treatment doesn't work, we go with an unapproved treatment.
Hey!
something on your mind?
because you totally can't tell.
I had a job interview lined up at new york mercy yesterday.
hospital for Manhattan's glitterati. Big coup. Your homies must be kvelling.
didn't happen, because apparently I called to cancel.
I don't remember making that call. You think I have neurological issue?
Yes. - Why are you jerking me around?
it wasn't me. - Yeah.
it was one of the other petty, socially repressed asses I work for.
maybe it was Ashton Kutcher.
if you want me to stay, tell me you want me to stay.
would it matter? No, but it'd be the adult way to handle it.
if the adult way doesn't work, why bother with it?
I've been totally professional! Gave two weeks notice, continued to work cases.
scheduled my interviews on my own time.
you have no right to screw with my future.
you're gonna be all whiny during the differential diagnoses, aren't you?
it wasn't me.
I only sabotage people I consider worth it.
you are one evil, cunning woman.
it's a massive turn-on.
you girls can gossip later.
what are you talking about?
you called New York Mercy to have Foreman's job interview killed.
when I said,"you girls can gossip later," I was throwing you out, but in a polite way.
well, I take it you're off your antidepressants.
Ah, you're deflecting. Only I'm allowed to do that.
does Foreman actually think I did that?
no, just me. But I know something he doesn't. I didn't do it.
why would I do it?
do you want him to leave? - No.
were you planning on doing something?
I'm waiting for board approval.
but if he takes the job, there's nothing to be done. You had to stop him.
wasn't me.
what are you doing?
looking for a tell. Rapid eye blink, twitch of the lips.
send in nurse Unger when you pass her on your way out.
almost forgot. I need to give a 16-year-old magic mushrooms to treat a cluster hdache. Is that cool?
Yeah, no problem.
I was being sarcastic.
wouldn't look that way in the court transcript.
mushrooms have psilocybins that work on cluster headaches.
it's either that, or cutting into his brain
I assume you've considered he could have a psychogenic experience.
possibly suffer a fit of severe paranoia.
well, I have now.
Yeah, it's definitely better that the dean of medicine prescribes it instead of an unhinged doctor with a history of drug use.
takes the stink off if the patient decides to put on a cape and fly off the roof.
low dose. No more than ten milligrams. Tightly controlled setting.
and make sure the mother signs off on it.
party on, Garth. And don't stand in Foreman's way. It's just wrong.
new research shows that a chemical component in the mushrooms can be
Yeah, lots of technical medical stuff. So when do I get 'em?
I went to college. I know about mushrooms.
a friend of a friend shot himself in the foot.
they're not giving mea gun, Enid!
sign the consent form.
we'll be monitoring him, but cardiac arrest is possible.
big E...
small N...
and if the mushrooms don't work?
the next step would bea type of brain surgery.
Oh, god.
pain's gettin' worse.
need 'sh rooms now!
Oh, yeah.
Nate, how's the pain?
that I'll always be true...
Hey, hey! It's skippy!
the bush kangaroo!
your head, Nate. We need to know how the pain is.
what I got here is the opposite of pain.
that means you're suffering from cluster headaches. Which means, hopefully
man, you're hot.
she's making me horny. - Deal with it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
you can't get me stoned, then not close the deal.
shut up. - Take it easy. He's not well.
you'll regret saying no.
check it out.
Oh, for god's sake.
hold it. - What the hell are you doing?
he has undersized testes.
his other secondary sexual characteristics are normal.
if you wanna curry favor with me, avoid discussions of other men's testicles.
Thanks.
focus on phrases like... "you were right about the cluster headaches."
but wrong about what caused them.
vascular problem in a major artery wouldn't cause hypogonadism.
okay, what causes rage, headaches, personality disorder, and hypogonadism?
Where's Foreman?
he's mad at me.
Why? - No reason.
Yeah, that makes sense.
the male genitals are controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
we're not talking about Foreman anymore.
the kid's being pummeled at school.
a couple blows to the head could cause hypothalamic lesions.
we ever gonna talk about what happens when Foreman's gone?
if this were an employee-owned airline in Scandinavia, yes.
it's not lesions. His temperature would be all over the map. Symptoms don't lie.
he's gone in less than a week and you haven't even read a resume?
doesn't even need to. The two of us can handle it.
Craniopharyngioma fits the symptoms.
biopsy the brat's pituitary.
and let the record show I was right about the cluster headaches.
forget it.
it's a straight forward procedure.
and cut something out of my brain? No way.
if it's a tumor, it could kill you.
just give me more 'shrooms, okay? I'll be fine.
you only need my consent, right?
Yeah, but it'll be a lot easier if he
do whatever you have to do.
you don't touch me, all right? You can touch me. Just not my brain.
Nate, you gotta do this. I can't take it anymore.
my god, mom! Save me the melodramatic hand-wringing, okay?
loosen up! Get yourself coited.
I'm gonna give hima sedative.
you're decent-looking, Dr. Skippy.
why don't you take her for a ride?
are you in pain?
his heart rate's normal. Respiration's even.
what's happening? What's the matter with him?
he's jaundiced. His liver's shutting down.
we started him on sodium polystyrene sulfonate.
his liver's operating at about 20% and deteriorating fast.
which means he'll be dead long before Foreman turns in his parking pass.
so, what causes personality disorder, head pain, blah blah blah, and liver failure?
liver failure can cause hypogonadism, head pain.
altered mental status leads to the personality disorder and rage.
all we need to do is figure out what caused the liver failure.
Yes-also, we need to figure out how symptoms yesterday can be caused by liver failure today.
if his liver's failing now, it wasn't great yesterday.
if it wasn't operating at capacity, it could have caused
ooh-aah! Whoa!
don't sneak up on a person like that.
I'm listening.
well, listening doesn't help me.
okay. Let's go with the liver and a time machine theory.
Foreman, what causes liver problems?
Wilson's disease.
no. Ceruloplasmin's normal.
no enlargement and no palpable mass, so no cancer.
could be a narrowing of the bile ducts. Primary sclerosingcholangitis.
most liver damage begins with what we put in our bodies. Foreman?
angry teen... alcohol.
no, blood tests were negative.
no signs of drug use or acetaminophen poisoning in his tox screen.
maybe the water was contaminated.
his mother would also be sick.
sounded like someone with back. Go.
we'll try and muddle through without your blank stare to guide us.
so if it's not the bad things he's putting in, what about the good things?
he was raised a vegetarian.
was raised. Means he's all grown up.
or he's not a vegetarian anymore.
he started eating red meat a few months ago.
unless he's been buying cuts of mad cow, his body would have no problem metabolizing it.
it would if he had an OTC deficiency.
body can't metabolize nitrogen, damages the liver.
run a hamburger test.
it's exactly what it sounds like. Stuff him full of meat, wait for his ammonia levels to spike.
I'll double your salary.
chase and Cameron would mutiny if they found out.
chase and Cameron wouldn't be heading up their own diagnostic group.
you'll work in parallel with House. It'll be your practice.
separate staff, separate cases. Complete autonomy.
I've only been doing this for three years.
three years under House. No better training.
and when that case comes along that I can't figure out?
you know who I'd have to go to.
or you can just let that patient die. That's completely up to you.
no.
Why?
he's evil.
he didn't sabotage your interview.
how do you know?
because I did.
I didn't.
you believed means you're not sure House did it.
well, somebody did it.
somebody here did it.
I can't work here.
this isn't a medical procedure.
this is just about Doogie making me eat garbage.
need to see how your liver processes the proteins.
then get me a steak, some roast beef.
what if I brought him something from home?
it has to be prepared here so we know there's no chemicals or preservatives that could affect the test results.
I'm not eating anything prepared by $5-an-hour immigrant hospital cooks in hairnets.
shut up!
either you start eating, or I'm gonna strap you to this bed and shove these down your throat one by one-got it?
you can't get mad at me.
I'm sick.
you're supposed to feel bad for me.
nurse, full set of body restraints. - Yes, doctor.
trust me.
it'll be a lot less messy if you do it yourself.
you killed Foreman's job interview.
why would I- - somebody did.
wasn't me, and it wasn't House, which means it has to be somebody who thought he was protecting House.
which means it hasto be somebody who actually likes House.
which means it's either you or the weird night janitor who wears his pants backwards.
I want Foreman to leave.
house has to realize he needs someone who stands up to him.
cameron's in love with him, chase is afraid of him, and I enable him.
house needs limits. - I give him
you authorize magic mushrooms.
house is a six-year-old who thinks he's better off without parents.
a few tummy aches after dinners of ice cream and ketchup might do him some good.
you're lying.
an enabler doesn't conspire against, an enabler enables.
what?
you're paranoid.
you made that call.
and because of that call, you guaranteed Foreman's out of here.
I thought it would be fun to work on my boat with him.
and you went shirtless because skin cancer looks cool.
well, I realize I got burnt. I'm not too worried about that.
it's these white marks, you know?
lie down.
I mean, that boat has all sorts of lead paint, and there's chemicals everywhere.
when daddy works on his boat, does he have a cooler with lots of brown bottles with long necks?
and does daddy like to lie down on his boat and go nap-nap in the sun?
Oh! What the hell?
I will give you this for the...
$1. 41 in your pocket.
wait, how could you know...
a psychic once told me that I'm psychic.
Hey, one of these quarters is canadian.
give me back my syringe.
hamburger stress test showed no change in his ammonia levels.
liver's properly converting the ammonia into urea.
he doesn't have OTC deficiency.
welcome back.
sorry. I shouldn't have been taking my problems out on the patient.
or on me. Apology accepted.
starve him. - What are we looking for?
diabetic steatosis would screw up his liver.
starve him overnight and see if his blood sugar pops.
we mess with his blood sugar, we could set off another rage.
not a problem. You can take him.
I want something to eat!
honey, please don't.
I was just trying to get a urine sample, and he went crazy.
I need to eat!
you're not sticking anything else in me.
it's just a few more hours.
you're gonna hurt yourself.
I'm gonna hurt you!
as soon as we get a urine sample, we can leave you alone.
you want your sample? Here's your damn sample!
Nate, don't.
Oh, my god.
Nate, you need to get back into bed. Right now.
chem panel and urinalysis confirms the bloody urine was caused by kidney failure.
he's on dialysis. He's gonna need it for the rest of his life.
which is shortening as we speak.
we are looking at a chinese menu, and we've got symptoms from too many columns.
they're going to overcharge us.
multiple organ failure could mean primary HIV infection.
that would meansomeone agreed to sleep with him.
plus his serologyis negative.
his uric acid's slightly elevated.
10% of males in this country have elevated
so we're only gonna pay attention to abnormal abnormalities?
we've been stuffing him with meat and his kidneys are shot. Of course his uric acid
could be hepatic fibrosisor MCADD.
the brat's got a genetic disorder.
get the sequencing primers. See if it's one of the ones we can treat.
I can draw some blood, but then I gotta run.
job interview?
you gonna stop me if it is?
you do the nurse stuff, they'll do the doctor stuff.
this a blood test for a marriage license?
plan on kidnapping me to Massachusetts or Canad...
what did you give him?
are you treating him for something?
sedative.
did he need a sedative?
I did. Just shutting him up so I can draw some of his bloodin peace.
you walked in with that. You didn't even give him a chance.
people are what they are.
he's sick.
the rudeness isn't his fault.
if he had tuberculosis, it wouldn't be his fault either.
but I still wouldn't let him cough on me.
Hi. - Hey.
where are you going?
the lab. We're testing our patient's blood for hereditary
Cuddy thinks I sabotaged Foreman's interview.
she's gonna fire me.
I don't believe it.
she said it was unprofessional and
no, I mean I literally don't believe it.
Cuddy wouldn't fire youfor something like that.
which means either she lied to you, or you're lying to me.
you so would have fallen for that three years ago.
you were looking for a reaction. You were looking for me to feel bad for you.
to save your skin. But how am I gonna save you?
unless...
you think I'm the one who really did it.
Cuddy's logic was Foreman's valuable to House.
I care about House. Ergo, I would do anything to save him.
and your logic was... I care about House as much as you do, ergo...
it wasn't me.
I don't care about House.
I don't believe you.
no one does.
house is nothing more than my boss.
Foreman's nothing more than a colleague.
you're lying.
everyone does. But it wasn't me.
no markers for hepatic fibrosis.
and nothing for MCADD.
Foreman's interview in New York got screwed up.
I heard.
foreman thought it was House, House thought it was Cuddy.
Cuddy thought it was Wilson, Wilson thought it was me.
and you think it was me?
you think I sabotaged Foreman?
I don't even want him here. - I know.
then why would I do
I think you sabotaged Foreman just to sabotage Foreman.
so everyone's a suspect because everyone wants to help House. Except for me.
I'm a suspect because I'm a petty, vindictive jerk?
you actually think I would do something like that?
it was someone. - It wasn't me.
negative for Von Gierke disease.
and it's tuesday.
I know.
I like you.
I know.
see you next tuesday.
found something.
he's got a partial HPRT enzyme deficiency.
means he could have Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome.
but it's a partial deficiency. So it may not be Kelley-Seegmiller.
Yes. Those are the two options. It is or it isn't.
Kelley-Seegmiller explains the aggressive personality.
if he d Kelley-Seegmiller, he wouldn't just be aggressive, he'd be self-mutilating.
chewing his lips, banging his head.
lovely disease. Degenerative, fatal, incurable.
I wonder if that's why Cameron's on the "not" side.
that and the fact that symptoms don't lie.
Kelley-Seegmiller carriers self-mutilate when they're stressed.
he's in the ICU with a failing liver and no kidneys.
Yeah, his life is sweet.
his vegetarian diet could have limited the purines in his system, slowing the disease's progress.
so let's speed it up. - Why?
so you two kids will stop fighting.
also, I don't feel like waiting for respiratory failure.
chase, find some way for the mother to get lost for a while.
I'm going to stress this kid until he bites off a finger.
they move me to geriatrics? Who are you?
Dr. Mccaney.
the man who's gonna kick your ass all over this chessboard.
Yeah, well, I'm too weak to- - bite yourself, yeah.
you need some liquid energy.
now, if you consent, I'm gonna give you this shot of adrenaline.
I don't wanna play.
aside from being indicative of pituitary issues and certain kinds of genetic disorders, small testicles also indicate...
that you'r a big chicken.
please don't make me do the sound effect.
you're not gonna goad me into playing.
didn't think I'd have to.
thought you'd just jump at the chance of humiliating someone.
age before cripple.
I'm white.
it... is... on!
bird's opening. Passive approach.
sign of a coward.
Sicilian defense. Sign of an idiot.
arrogance has to be earned.
tell me what you've done to earn yours.
I can walk.
I don't bleed out of my penis.
check.
you know, it's a real thin line between tortured genius and awkward kid who can't get girls because he's creepy.
why are you doing this?
to stress you out.
check.
Yeah, but why?
I'd tell you, but I figure it's more stressful if you don't know why.
Yeah, well... I'm not feeling too stressed.
you know that no one likes you, right?
Yeah, well, anybody like you?
you're dying.
check.
your move.
care to lay down your king?
you can't win.
you can pin my queen.
my knight to e7. Your king to h8.
sacrifice rook takes pawn.
Bishop blocks. Queen to h5. Check mate.
save what's left of your dignity.
lay down your king.
crap.
he's having a seizure.
four milligrams iv lorazepam. - Right away.
I hate this kid.
I like this kid.
did you get the job?
they're gonna let me know.
Kelley-Seegmiller didn't cause this seizure.
so we've got one more symptom, one less diagnosis.
I assume they're gonna call for references? Did you give 'em my name?
no.
amyloidosis can cause seizures, and the protein buildup could cause organ failure.
wouldn't alter his personality.
whose name did you give?
my last boss.
Ouch. That can't look good.
I hate this kid.
what if we're not dealing with one condition? What if it's multiple conditions?
uh, it's gotta be one. It's always one.
nothing explains this constellation of symptoms.
we've gotta be missing something. Maybe the kid lied about some medication.
maybe he's hiding something.
why would he be hiding something? - I don't know, because he's evil?
what if he is?
what if the symptoms lied?
there.
now all we're looking at is a simple, evil jerk with amyloidosis.
you're not being objective.
amyloidosis was your idea.
you were right, it doesn't fit the symptoms.
Yeah, it does.
look.
you crossed it off because you wanna hate the kid.
and you can't hate him if he's a victim
you want him to be a victim because you wanna believe that people are good.
and if they're not, it's gotta be a chemical problem.
except they're not, and it's not.
flush him with immunosuppressants, get a biopsy to confirm, and find him a marrow donor.
what will happen to him?
substances called amyloid proteins build up in the body's organs, shutting them down.
it's a fairly rare disease. And I'm afraid it can be fatal.
so do you operate or something to take them out?
he needs a bone marrow transplant.
Dr. Cameron is searching the donor bank.
we should test you as well.
when you first told me he was sick...
I was... happy.
relieved.
now...
Nate, I'm gonna take a small piece of nerve from your ankle.
let me know if you feel any pain.
I'm burning up.
couldn't you just knock me out like you did last time?
wish I could. But your body has to be clear so it's ready for a marrow transplant.
Hey, Dr. X...
I know you've busted ass trying to save me.
it's all right.
I wasn't gonna thank you.
I was gonna tell youyou really suck at this.
we're doing our best.
that's sort of my point.
your best really sucks.
nerve biopsy was clean.
no evidence of amyloidosis.
it was your idea. Don't give up on it so fast.
he's running a fever. If it's two conditions, one of them's gotta be an infection.
we should start him on antibiotics, see what clears up, what doesn't.
is he having trouble breathing?
Yeah, he has mucus in his chest from an infection.
could also be an amyloid buildup.
keep him on immunosuppressants and biopsy somewhere else, his sinuses.
look, you got two choices.
engage me in a futile argument then do what I asked, or just do what I asked.
you're not ready.
there was a third choice. Don't do what I asked.
you could have defied me, stuck the kid on antibiotics. But you didn'T.
because you still trust my judgment more than your own.
you sabotaged Foreman's job interview, didn't you?
Foreman's already been over this. It wasn't me.
everybody's chasing ghosts over this.
which means either nobody did it, or somebody wants everybody chasing ghosts.
now, who does that sound like?
and why would I do that?
because as long as Foreman thought you were guilty, he was gonna be useless around here.
you know, sometimes I forget why I hired you.
you cost him a good opportunity and gained nothing.
I cost him a crappy opportunity.
new York Mercy's where you go to treat boils and cysts and build a 401k.
if you want him to stay, tell him.
I don't. And there'd be no point.
you do.
and the point would be to make him feel like he's wanted.
he doesn't need that.
all right, then. It'd make him feel like maybe you weren't evil.
he needs that.
talk to Foreman.
we dumped one symptom.
but forgot to add one.
revenge time, Nate.
are you... - yes! I am.
black or white?
just limp away.
he doesn't wanna play. Leave him alone.
pick one, or this comes out.
and for all you know, this is really important.
Ow! Stop it!
that hurts, right?
which is odd, because I'm really enjoying this.
you hold the pieces that way because you can't bend your thumb.
because your bones have formed abnormally.
thanks to all the crap that's been pushing its way in between them.
actually, this stuff isn't important at all.
your doctors said he needs immunosuppressants.
they're idiots. It's not amyloidosis.
it's iron. He's got hemochromatosis.
the body absorbs iron from food, but can't process it. Can't get rid of it.
and idle iron is the devil's playground.
it builds up in the organs and joints, whacking them in the process.
caused all of the symptoms.
including something that wasn't a symptom.
those body aches, they were not from the fighting.
his personality issues?
sorry.
the iron's innocent on that count.
your kid's a jerk. And yeah, it's probably your fault.
although, if you'd stayed off the meat like your mom said, you'd have half as much iron, and be twice less almost dead.
Oh, nurse!
this patient is bleeding for some reason.
is he going to be okay?
he'll need dialysis.
and he'll have to get his blood drained every few months for the rest of his life.
but my condolences. It's going to be a long and annoying life.
and I wouldn't have taken your bishop.
I'd have moved my queen to d6, defusing the threat.
then rook to e8, attacking the king's pawn.
I'd have lost the exchange, but won the game.
I know.
I was bluffing.
and that's why...
you lost.
little jerk.
you just here to watch, or you got something to say?
still running the new biopsy for amyloidosis?
Yeah, but still nothing.
run the test again. Recheck your results.
looks like you're in for an all-nighter.
and nine-time National Champion Tony Cooper. - How do you feel? - Great.
you sure you don't wanna go to law school?
I hate lawyers.
and so do I, go, get him baby.
ready to go.
let's hear it, folks!
and it's Casey Alfonso by less than half a car length!
what a spectacular finish for the young phenom！
Casey Alfonso makes an amazing finish.
what do you do at the end there?
Yeah, heh...
at about 250 feet, the car got out of shape a bit. But about halfway down...
I just got into the zone or something.
I pedaled it back into the groove. It was the coolest ride of my life!
how does it feel to beat nine-time national champion Tony Cooper?
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
how does it feel to beat nine-time national champion tony cooper?
out of the way! Out of the way. Casey!
Casey! Get the ambulance! Brian, get the ambulance!
Ah, 68's a good run.
that'll leave something in the lock box for the rest of us.
next! - That's your breakfast?
technically, it's Wilson's lunch.
20-month-old baby, persistent rash, fever... - Too much crying.
female college student with... - Too much drama.
you don't care about the crying or the drama.
because you won't see the patient.
and you'd treat Methuselah if his snot had an interesting color.
it means you've already decided which case you wanna take next.
tell me about speed racer.
female, seizure with visual and auditory processing deficiency.
I did a consult and - What kind of race car?
dragster.
continue. - You're gonna take a case based on the car she drives?
nothing says "thanks for saving my life."
like a test drive in a car accelerates faster than the space shuttle.
you can't save her life, because she's not dying.
her lab shows signs of dehydration.
that means the problem's just likely...Heatstroke.
kinda hard to get heat-struck in 4.5 seconds.
not when you're wearing a three-layer fireproof suit.
excuse me.
Dr. House?
no, lazy ass called in sick again. We can give him a message.
may we talk in private?
So...either it's heatstroke, in which case we take the afternoon off, or it's one of the diagnoses that you guys are gonna have for me in two minutes.
you're in charge. - I know.
cop? - He's not packing.
your dad's either a cop or a security guard.
or she carries a weapon.
you're with the CIA?
one of our employees just returned from an assignment sick.
we believe he may be the victim of an assassination attempt.
sure. You wanna close the door?
door?
well, I assume you're gonna drop trou at some point during the dance.
I don't see why I should share. - This isn't a joke.
if you're willing to help us, we need to leave now.
if I have to walk somewhere, there better be at least five girls involved.
and they better be working their way through college.
okay, what do you got?
hereditary brain disorder, transient ischaemia, or para-neoplastic syndrome.
none of those goes away with iv fluids. It's heatstroke.
or cushing's or calcium deficiency.
who's your friend? - We use the term "life partner."
get a fresh history, neurological exam, and an MRI of her head.
15 minutes for the lap dance, a half hour to scrub the guilt off my soul.
see you in 45.
Dr. House...We need to hurry.
Yeah, we need to hurry.
little advice, I mean, obviously the village people played out the whole cop thing.
but, come on, CIA?
do you seriously expect anyone to believe that?
it helps when you have props.
keep your eye on my pen.
very good.
any nausea or vomiting before the seizure?
no.
my dad had some, but he's always like that before a race.
it could have been food poisoning.
you two eat breakfast together? - No.
any history of sciatica or spinal injury?
no.
abnormal deep tendon reflex.
Really?
let me see.
it's there. - I didn't say it wasn't there. I said it was abnormal.
we're gonna give you an MRI to be sure, but I'm guessing your symptoms were caused by just dehydration and the heat.
you're guessing?
look, I make a living driving 300 miles an hour, which makes the ability to stay conscious kind of important.
I'm sure it's just heatstroke.
but we're gonna do an MRI to be extra careful.
you said you left your cell in your office.
I lied.
I wasn't going to take it, just tell you to turn it off for take off.
I know...just wanted to see if you could tell that I was lying.
useful information.
yeah? - Where are you?
I'm on a top-secret mission for the CIA.
right. There was nothing on your race car driver's CT, and the history and physical were normal.
her deep tendon reflexes seemed a bit weak to me.
areflexia could mean Miller Fisher.
Yes, areflexia could mean Miller - Fisher, but since the reflex was weak, not absent, it doesn't mean anything. I'm releasing her.
you can go back to your poker game. - Poker's illegal.
CIA would never allow illegal activity.
have you considered Miller - Fisher?
Why? What happened?
she just had another seizure.
and now she's getting a vertical nystagmus.
we think it's Miller - Fisher, an inflammatory process.
in rare cases, it can cause respiratory failure, but...
wait, she could stop breathing?
you said there was nothing wrong. You said you were sure.
you just had another seizure. Clearly, there's something wrong.
so why should I trust you to figure out what it is?
Where's Dr. House? I'm at this hospital bec...
it's gonna be all right.
we just need to start the plasmapheresis.
No!
it's not going to be all right, because you obviously don't have a clue what you're doing.
I'm not letting you touch me.
honey, come on. - I wanna see House!
where is he?
looks a lot better on 24.
I take that back.
Dr. Samira terzi.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. House.
we really appreciate the consult on such short notice.
there's nothing that gives me more pleasure than helping out a colleague.
this is Dr. Sidney Curtis from the Mayo Clinic.
he also agreed to help with the diagnosis.
Dr. House. - Curtis on immunology Sidney Curtis?
Oh, you've read it?
Nope! But it is keeping my piano level.
cutthroat Bitch
So...where is the poor, sick fella?
what do we do? - I don't know yet.
she needs treatment. - This is a test, right?
you're reporting back to him everything we do.
Yeah. And I asked the patient to be uncooperative.
personally, I think she overplayed it.
she's being uncooperative because you made us all look like idiots.
we're only gonna look like idiots if we can't figure out how to get her to agree to the treatment.
what would House do right now?
pop a pill, insult us, and trick the patient.
we can do that last part.
she's never met House before, has she? Who's got a cane?
house isn't here.
we're not gonna act like him.
what do you want?
I, uh...
I'm gonna do what doctors aren't supposed to do:
admit I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss your symptoms.
but you need to let us start the plasmapheresis.
what do you want?
honey, do you know where you are?
she's burning up.
start the treatment. - We can't.
you've got my permission. She's obviously confused. - It doesn't matter anymore.
Miller - Fisher doesn't cause delirium and fever.
I don't know what this is.
I'm afraid there are going to be some limitations on his medical history.
just let me know what you need, and I should be able to provide it.
FYI, my malpractice insurance doesn't cover alien autopsies.
that's fine. X- files are the next wing over.
where was the patient when he first felt ill?
sorry, that's classified.
but assume there aren't too many places in the world John hasn't been.
and, yes, John's a cover name.
and what makes you think it was an attempt on his life?
sorry, can't tell you that either.
what can you tell us?
did Oswald really have sex with Marilyn Monroe?
good lord.
very professional.
five days ago, he was 185 pounds.
perfect health.
cool.
fever and delirium rule out...
uh, he's not gonna hire you just because you call him the most.
especially since it's obvious he doesn't wanna be called.
symptoms rule out Miller - Fisher. M.S. fits better.
Progression's too fast. More likely meningitis.
areflexia doesn't fit as well with...
does with amyloidosis. - That's even slower than M.S. It's lupus.
I'm with the little man on this one.
it's attacking the body and the brain. Classic autoimmune.
flirt all you want, but I should warn you:
Shiksas are for practice.
lupus is aggressive wouldn't spare her kidneys.
it's primarily neurological.
let's start her on - Why no plaques on her MRI?
MRI was inconclusive.
so I don't know - So now you're sure that it's M.S.
just like you were sure it was Miller - Fisher an hour after you were sure it was heatstroke.
the symptoms fit. Start her on interferon.
we're not gonna score any points with House if we solve this just by running your errands.
I get that you want to be right. - You don't?
I'm just trying to save a patient, not score points with my boss.
would it hurt the patient if you let us run some tests?
you've got three hours.
we've run six complete tox screens, tested for every heavy metal, poison, and biological agent we can think of.
it says here he ate a lot of chestnuts.
hold on a second.
if the squirrel liberation army's involved, I'm outta here.
those little rodents are - Horse chestnuts are poisonous.
if someone switched them - Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts, but they taste like a horse's lower-than-chestnuts.
which makes the theory that he accidentally ate a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive.
and seeing as how he was prowling the back alleys of...Tehran?
it wasn't Tehran. It was.
Oops. You almost got me.
unless we know the local environmental factors...
poisonous flora - You know I can't tell you that.
well, then, why are we here? You might as well just google "poison."
all they would tell me is...
he spent the last 11 months in Bolivia.
who you gonna kill in Bolivia?
my old Housekeeper? - We don't kill people.
I'm sorry. Who are you gonna marginalize?
if it is my Housekeeper, she has it coming.
cleaning the windows means cleaning both sides. Am I right, or am I right?
what does it matter what he was doing?
the guy's dying. - Not anymore.
I know what's poisoning him. And who.
John.
it's just pancreatitis.
he's not an alcoholic.
and unless his pancreas is in his fingers...
spies can't get fungal infections?
and the burns on his skin? - Spies can't get sunburns?
bolivia doesn't have sun?
so, either we go with his theory of the non-drinking drunk, or he was poisoned by some group with the resources to make it completely untraceable.
some customized isotope.
let's treat for radiation poisoning.
the iodine's to protect your thyroid.
antibiotics are to handle infections.
should start working in a couple of hours.
we should celebrate...
with a beer. Or eight.
I don't drink.
Oh...me thinks he doth protest too much.
he's deathly ill. Why would he lie about drinking?
guilt over killing a man.
make anyone hit the sauce.
we don't kill people. - Right.
you just lie to your friends and family, establish false identities, trick people into betraying their country.
he'd never cover up his drinking-- he's too honest.
Hey. Something I've always wanted to know.
that poison lipstick that Ginger used to kiss Gilligan...
why didn't that kill her?
okay, drum roll.
lp is negative for meningitis.
sorry, Cole.
fat pad biopsy is...
Oh, wait for it...
negative for amyloidosis. And thirteen goes down.
could we hurry this up? My son has - Can I have a kid too? I'm working too hard.
I could hook you up.
if I had two minutes and some anti-nausea meds, I'd take you up on that.
and for the gold...
protein 65, glucose 70.
it's M.S. Start her on interferon.
turn to the last page, Sed rate's 95. A.n. a.'s weakly positive.
positive? It's lupus. - Weakly. Not lupus, it's M.S.
we obviously don't know what it is. Treat for both.
no. I gave in on the test.
I'm not treating her for two completely separate diseases because you think lupus will win you a prize.
still think it's lupus? - Yeah.
me too.
in case of emergency, go to the emergency room.
could be lupus. That's what we figured.
then why are you here? - You're an immunologist. We wanted to confirm
who are you looking for me to help you sell down the river?
house or Cuddy?
sorry. - He's pushing M.S.
thinks that because he's in charge, he has to prove he's the smartest guy in the room.
all I've heard about you: you put the patient above everything else.
that's why everyone finds you so annoying.
all House cares about is results.
I know. I'm talking about how to do deal with Foreman.
so am I.
fever's down to 101. 5.
treatment's working. Why are we out here?
trying to figure out which treatment's working.
it's kind of tacky doing it in front of the patient.
you put her on steroids too?
we had no choice...The sed rate pointed to lupus.
and the A.N.A. Ruled it out!
doctors!
legs hurt?
I can't feel them at all. I don't think I can move them.
vitals stabilizing.
tummy ache's gone as well.
so the treatment's working.
wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy and...hop in the company jet?
little trip down Mexico way.
and I'm not talking about the country or the plane.
do you think acting like an idiot and talking about sex works on girls?
well, if it didn't, the human race would have died out long ago.
you're pretty cheery for someone who was just proved wrong about his pancreatitis theory.
I'm appropriately cheery for someone who's being proved right.
John hasn't vomited in six hours.
what's to vomit? I'm eating his lunch.
withholding nutrients is the treatment for pancreatitis.
that and the antibiotics you put him on.
I did unhook your iodine, though.
didn't seem to fit with the whole I'm-just-jerking- You-guys-around gestalt.
you're unbelievable.
well, let's ask John if he'd rather be sick honestly or cured dishonestly.
any chance he's just...
overwhelmed with gratitude?
paralysis.
uh...it's a new symptom?
big white space on the board where it would fit?
nice, multicolored markers?
I'm not writing it because we can't know if it's a real symptom.
when these two went rogue and pumped her full of steroids
steroids don't cause paralysis.
she was also on interferon!
giving her both probably fried her immune system.
who knows what infection you could cause.
we consulted an immunologist.
she said we have. - She?
you talking about Dr. Cameron?
she thought lupus was... - She tells you to start treating?
Yes, they've ignored you. They screwed up.
and it's fun watching you spank them.
but can we get back to the medicine?
the last thing any of you give a damn about is the medicine!
look...
I'm not saying you're bad doctors or bad people.
but House is.
he created a nasty little cutthroat world, planted you in it, and is watching you play.
and none of it works for anyone except him.
and whoever wins.
given its quick progression, we gotta assume botulism.
I'll go to her place, check out her fridge and pantry.
it's not botulism. It's polio.
brilliant. We should search her home for FDR's remains or a time machine.
she could have contracted it from anyone who's been to Africa or...
she's been vaccinated.
vaccines wear off.
there hasn't been a single American case in over 20 years.
I've seen this disease.
I know what it looks like. - That's why you're finding it.
because you're looking for it.
Polio...it's crazy.
house wouldn't think so.
so go find House and tell him your theory.
take a personal day. Seriously.
get outta here.
you don't have the power to fire me.
but I do have the power to kick your ass off my case.
we're starting the botulism treatment.
the rest of you, look for confirmation.
he should be brought up on charges. - Okay, relax.
I'll take your book out from under my piano.
he's dying of radiation sickness.
he's obviously in pain.
all of which could have been avoided if you hadn't interfered with...
what was that for?!
radiation sickness kills specific cells at specific times.
his hair should be coming out in clumps before he's writhing in pain.
since it's not, I know who's trying to kill him.
God.
it's blood cancer. Waldenstrom's.
radiation can cause infections, which set off...
if had any real evidence of foul play, you'd be torturing Bolivians instead of putting me into a state of anticipatory sexual arousal.
can we treat for both? - Bad idea.
unless you're the one who's trying to poison him.
I'll arrange for plasmapheresis and chemo.
are you gonna trust him after what he did?
I don't have to trust him to agree with him.
you make a good point.
I've been wrong every time, and she still won't listen to you.
so either she really likes me or she really hates you.
and I got a ride in the jet.
Oh. Hi.
what are you doing here? - Just came to say hi.
hi again.
Where's...Mrs. Bearman?
sent her home. - I was scheduling her for an MRA.
if we gave MRAs to every patient with a headache...
this wasn't just a headache, it was the worst in her life.
then lucky for you I'm a neurologist.
she went to a wine and cheese tasting.
both triggers for migraines. - She's never had a migraine before.
and I never have bagel before the first time I had one.
bagels don't kill people.
this is a classic ticking-bomb aneurysm.
this taught me a lesson.
I guess when I mess with other people's patients, I risk looking like an officious bitch.
we're gonna have to track down Mrs. Bearman.
wait...
never mind.
that's funny. - It's not funny. It's totally immature.
it is funny. You just can't appreciate it because you're the victim.
Yeah, I deserve shame and ridicule for offering a consult.
unheard of for a doctor.
you didn't offer a medical consult.
you offered a "dealing with Foreman" consult. - For the good of the patient.
it's what House would have done.
maybe House will hear about it and tear up with pride.
you think I'm trying to impress him.
I think that, for someone who's not involved in his team, you're remarkably involved in his team.
let it go.
let him go.
and that's mature?
120 over 80.
now we got the medical stuff out of the way.
why don't we meet back at your place for some enhanced interrogation techniques?
my safe word is,"help, please, please stop."
it's two pleases.
anything less than that, you keep going.
you actually cure this guy, I'll show you my private water board.
we need to consult an oncologist about the chemo.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought...
you were still euphemizing.
my valet knows a little oncology.
I was wondering when you'd grow bored of avoiding my calls.
Oh, I can never grow bored of ignoring you.
what's the latest protocol on waldenstrom's?
where are you? - CIA headquarters
how much fludarabine？
either you're sprawled naked on your floor with an empty bottle of vicodin, or collapsed naked in front of your computer with an empty bottle of viagra.
please tell me which, because Chase has another pool going.
they flew me in to help deal with a sick employee.
how much？ - Hallucinations. Damn!
I shouldn't have bet on the viagra.
okay, call the Langley switchboard, ask for extension...
he asked an awful lot of questions for a valet.
you know, I happen to have a position available on my penis.
wait a second - I think I screwed up that joke.
you offering me a job?
I'd settle for that.
as tempting as a position on your staff is, - I like it here. - Pays better.
and we've only had one assassination attempt.
and I'm sure you're a great boss.
that's why your fellows left en masse a couple of months ago.
I have satellite images.
inspector Gadget.
my god. You're actually at the CIA.
you've gotta get down here.
they've got a satellite aimed directly into cuddy's vagina.
I told them the chances of invasion are slim to none, waldenstrom's.
recommended dose is 25 milligrams per meter squared.
they do a background check on you?
25 milligrams?
they did a background check on you, they did a background check on your friends.
relax.
I'm sure they already know that you brought heroin back from Afghanistan.
that...that's not true. I've never been to Afghanistan.
she's getting worse? - Fever's risen slightly.
but it's definitely, um...
What...botulism?
right? Because if you're wrong again, and you're treating her for something she doesn't even have, the antitoxin hasn't had time to work yet.
I know it's hard, but try to be patient.
excuse me.
I know you're pissed I interrupted, but you're gonna be even more pissed in a second.
you tested her without telling me?
Yeah. And I know, I'm really, really sorry.
But...on the other hand, it's a positive.
she has polio.
now what, boss?
Where's House?
he's blown off four hours of clinic.
he's consulting for the CIA.
seriously. Call Langley and ask for extension 35...
there's definitely two threes. I - I wrote it down.
I have it somewhere. - He's gonna make up twice his skipped hours in the clinic.
Okeydoke.
and for protecting him, you're gonna make up twice that.
why are you punishing me worse than him?
because House never learns. You might.
how are you feeling?
like crap.
Yeah, cancer can be that way.
my hair is falling out.
that the chemo?
no, it's too quick.
so what does it mean?
it means you don't have cancer.
someone actually did try to kill you.
you're stubborn.
you're arrogant! - There's no need to yell.
you may have cost that man his life.
he's getting the radiation treatment.
24 hours too late!
I didn't yell at you when I thought you were wrong.
I wasn't wrong! - This isn't productive.
there is no productive. It's too late.
because of your inexperience, your poor judgment.
and your failure to recognize a reckless fool!
cordyceps sinensis.
it's, uh...it's an herbal treatment derived from a parasitic fungus, comes from caterpillars.
along with dimercaprol chelation, it's been shown to mitigate bone marrow damage from radiation poisoning in monkeys.
I'm sorry. I was stubborn and arrogant.
Self-recriminations won't help her.
nothing's gonna help her. She's got polio.
there's no cure, but there are treatments.
she's dying. - Yeah.
every death's a tragedy.
funny how you weren't so depressed when she just dying because me and Amber screwed up.
and I'm also self-centered. Thanks for clarifying.
don't forget self-pitying.
vitamin c.
extremely high doses. It was experimental treatment protocol in the '50s.
and they haven't finished yet? - They...lost funding.
that's because there's no logical reason vitamin c would cure polio.
well, someone thought there was.
someone thought black people made excellent farm implements.
I'm not talking about hurting anyone.
I just wanna force feed her some orange juice.
you wanna throw in some bacon and eggs as well?
if there's anything you learn today, it's gotta be that you can be wrong.
John, can you hear me?
we're going to start you on an experimental treatment.
tea?
it's a Chinese herb.
which has been effective in... - I'm dying, aren't i?
probably.
we're gonna attempt an experimental protocol.
a new drug? - An old one. Vitamin c.
ultra-high doses have been shown to destroy the polio virus and heal nerve damage.
she could regain use of her legs.
it's unlikely.
but we're gonna try. Don't give up.
Nausea's...
not as bad.
radiation sickness has a latency period.
you'll get better before you get worse.
you wanna know what I really did down there?
only if it's interesting.
the women there...
during carnival they...
they do this dance.
they call it the devil dance.
not interesting.
I spent all 40 days with this attache to the minister of defense.
the most...
buttoned-down woman you'd ever meet. You know?
except when she did this dance.
she agreed to tell me stuff...
okay, we have half a good story there.
karma.
best way to rid yourself of that guilt is to confess your sins.
this pain is...right.
it's comforting.
it makes me think that...Somehow, it all makes sense.
what do you mean, 40 days?
when they found out.
what she...told me.
carnival in Bolivia's only eight days.
you have any idea what a chestnut looks like?
you idiot.
who are you calling an idiot?
whoever knew that john was stationed in Brazil, - not Bolivia. - Brazil?
well, then, I guess I'm talking to you, idiot.
it's the same region.
it's the same parasite, same diseases.
but not the same language.
in Bolivia, chestnuts are chestnuts.
brazil, on the other hand, hascastanhas-do-para, literally,"chestnuts from para."
because it would be stupid for people from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts!
so he ate Brazil nuts. Big deal.
no, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts.
which is a big deal, because they contain selenium.
which, in high doses, causes fatigue, vomiting, skin irritation, discharge from the fingernail beds, and hair loss. Any of that sounding familiar?
can you treat it?
we've already started.
treatment's chelation, same as for radiation sickness.
the only difference is it works a lot better on nut poisoning.
so what's the problem?
you're an idiot.
why is she shivering?
low serum calcium is a side effect of the treatment.
I can give her a calcium supplement.
my arm hurts.
infusion rate has to remain high for the treatment to work.
is it working?
you feel that? - Yeah.
it hurts.
it's working.
this is fantastic.
there's a lot you can learn in my fellowship.
a few new procedures I could teach you.
of course, we'd need a nurse to prep.
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.
actually, I was just trying to make another euphemism for sex.
so was i. - Oh, god.
how can you flirt with this idiot?
he lied to us again and again.
he broke laws, ethical codes
I was right.
that doesn't mean everything.
it means a lot.
Dr. Curtis.
Dr. House.
appreciate your help.
Hey. - Hey.
when...
when you were dying, you tried to infect me.
because you knew I'd fight for you if I thought I was dying too.
you bringing this up now so I'll forgive you for messing with my patient?
I'm happy I changed jobs.
but I know I'll never have that sort of...
excitement. - You miss people trying to kill you?
no.
I miss...people doing whatever it takes to get the job done.
I guess that's why I'm having trouble giving it up.
I shouldn't have helped them mess with your patient.
they had to screw with me.
I've gotten everything wrong.
I don't believe it.
you're not gonna get everything right.
but you're never gonna get everything wrong.
morning!
uh, where have you been the last two days?
overslept. - We saved speed racer.
she had polio.
we cured it with vitamin c.
Yeah.
I cured depression with tonic water once.
actually, I think there was some gin in it too.
150 grams over six hours.
it worked. - No, it didn't.
I told you you can't cure polio.
that means either she's not cured or she never had it.
since she's walking out of here...
I tested her blood from admittance.
no polio.
that means Brennan screwed up the lab tests.
or you screwed up your lab tests.
you must have. She got better.
so it's relapsing and remitting.
Maybe...porphyria.
Nah, that's a stretch.
if she had porphyria, you would have seen purple urine.
you think it's more likely he cured polio?
they believe it.
her symptoms fit perfectly.
and the alternative is unbelievably convoluted.
some doctor would have to poison her with valium so it looks like polio, then fake a lab test, then give her vitamin c and stop the poison so she magically gets better.
Actually...it is kind of doable, right?
so what do you think?
should we test her for thallium before you contact Stockholm?
you poisoned her?
the really shocking thing is that Foreman was right about the heatstroke.
vitamin C cures polio. I've seen it.
Yeah...in some bush clinic.
you need polio in a place with a proper lab.
the only problem is that places with proper labs don't have polio.
there is no money in finding cures for diseases that only kill poor people.
this will make them do research.
and what do you care if I faked a lab test if it saves a few thousand lives?
I did what I had to do.
isn't that what you hired us for?
which is why I'm not gonna fire you.
you're gonna quit.
go on, get out of here.
so you're just gonna let him go?
Absolutely.
I'm gonna let him get as far away as possible before you call the cops.
guy's a nut job.
who the hell did I leave in charge?
foreman. - there was a reason for that.
next time, listen to him.
where have you been?
and don't say the CIA. - okay.
either you're gonna have to get someone from the CIA to call and confirm your story, or you're doing eight clinic hours and Wilson is doing 16.
I was in the Hampton.
I was helping some rich hedge fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.
fascinating as that sounds.
for your honesty, I will forgive your hours.
thank you.
No!
the only thing less likely than your helping the CIA is your helping some rich guy on long island.
you're doing your hours and Wilson's.
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.
who doesn't?
Hi. - Hi.
I'm going to take you up on your offer.
yeah?
well, i,uh, I live a couple miles from here.
that's not the offer I meant.
I gave notice today.
you said you were happy at the company.
I lied. doubt you'll hold it against me.
I'll see you at 9: 00 on Monday.
you okay?
I'm thinking.
thinking's not gonna get you to the top.
mom, you're supposed to be encouraging me.
no, I'm supposed to be coaching you.
there's a hold about a foot above you on the left.
I know.
nice grab.
keep going, you're almost there, babe.
I can't. My calf's cramping.
you need to get off your toes.
get on the ball of your foot.
I can't. - Yes, you can.
you can get all the way to the top.
it's okay, I got you. You all right?
looks like you were wrong.
Yeah, but you did awesome.
that's the highest you've gotten.
I'm proud of you.
I don't feel so good.
okay, come on down.
mom?
mom, are you okay?
Oh, god.
are you all right?
my arm...I think I broke it.
don't move. - God, Jane, I'm so sorry.
what happened? Did the rope break?
no. My hands...
I can't move them.
she's been to an ortho, two neuros, and an immunologist.
none of the treatments have had any effect.
you think it's over?
it's getting worse.
last neurologist found intermittent numbness in both arms as well as the hand paralysis.
I meant the game.
you think he's gonna keep all four of us?
he said he would.
no sign of upper motor neuron involvement.
he lies.
my ears are burning.
tell 'em you're done firing people.
well, if I lie...
that would be little reassurance.
Dr. Kutner, who told you that it would be a good idea to put up superficial representations of a hypocritical season celebrating a mythical figure?
it wasn't me.
he lied.
homey knows better, hymie doesn't care, and huntington's would have done a better job.
I don't have huntington's that you know of.
why would you... - Because I got sued when I called you "honeybuns."
am I fired if I put up...
the point of the game was to scare us.
telling us it's over isn't scary.
therefore he has no reason to say that unless it's true.
good.
then can we do a secret Santa?
I liked you better 15 seconds ago when you were afraid for your job.
so who's sick?
35-year-old single mom.
it's an odd presentation of paralysis.
is there any history of drug use?
no.
she says there's no history.
she's not a liar.
okay, this is gonna be a tough case.
I have almost no knowledge of alien physiology.
everyone lies, but there's an exception to every rule.
actually, there isn't.
that's kinda what makes it a rule.
the patient's mother died of breast cancer when she was seven.
she never even knew her mom was sick.
she promised herself she would never hide anything from her own daughter.
Oh, I didn't know she promised.
and we're not her daughter.
the patient inherited the brca1 mutation from her mom.
she got a prophylactic double mastectomy ten years ago.
she lied about it.
she told her co-workers.
she told her kid.
she lied to the world.
reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people...she didn't get reconstructive surgery.
okay, we can rule out breast cancer.
actually, I was gonna rule it in.
paralysis could be paraneoplastic.
even the best surgeon can't remove every cell of breast tissue.
MRI what's left of her chest.
set the machine to scan for irony.
I'm gonna go redo the patient history.
your mom tell you about all the drugs she does?
she smokes pot once in a while, but not in a long time.
what about you?
how would that make her sick?
are you a doctor?
I'm 11.
that's not an answer.
that's an evasion.
like drinking?
you ever sneak a drink?
I don't do any of that stuff.
it's bad for you.
I understand why you don't want your mom to know.
but I'm her doctor, so... - I would tell my mom.
and I would tell you.
Why?
because she would never lie to me.
what's her favorite way to have sex?
I don't get what sex has to do with breast cancer.
are you a doctor?
did you go to med school since the last time I asked?
you just think we've got to be lying to...
white lies?
what are those?
those are lies we tell to make other people feel better.
I don't lie.
Rationalizations?
what are those?
those are lies we tell to make ourselves feel better.
we don't. - Lies of omission?
saddle bronc or doggie?
that's sex talk.
she used to like being on top.
but now she likes to be on her stomach.
that way she doesn't have to see them looking at her scars.
it's child abuse.
honesty?
there's a reason that everybody lies... it works.
it's what allows society to function.
it's what separates man from beast.
Oh, I thought that was our thumbs.
you wanna know every place your mom's thumb has been?
I'm sorry, I missed rehearsal.
am I taking the "truth is good" side?
don't you usually take that part?
lies are a tool to be used either for good...
no, wait. I got a better one.
lies are like children.
hard work, but they're worth it, because the future depends on 'em.
you are so full of love...or something.
when you care about someone... - you lie to them!
you pretend that their constant ponderous musings are interesting.
you tell them that they're not losing their boyish good looks or becoming worn out and...
I stand corrected.
and may I say it's been a real pleasure chatting with you.
Axilla's clean.
surgical margins look clear.
no lymphadenopathy, no masses, no nothing.
it's not cancer.
we need a new theory.
you catch her lying?
not yet.
wouldn't "no" have been a shorter answer?
wouldn't you not talking have made this a shorter conversation?
kid says mom's a slut.
she called her mom a slut?
no, I called her mom a slut.
she jumps anything with a pole and a pulse.
not that I'm judging here.
given her medical history, I'm actually impressed.
Maggie already admitted to having multiple sexual partners.
which is why we already tested for and ruled out syphilis and any other STD that could have caused her symptoms.
stds aren't the only risk in risky sex.
the problem in sleeping with strangers is they're strange.
we'll follow up with any recent partners.
send Foreman and Taub.
they're better liars, more likely to get to the truth.
you think I drugged her?
use a coaster.
we're not cops.
legally, we don't care one way or another.
but we need to know the truth so we can help her.
I'd known her for less than an hour, and she offered to take me home.
there was no need to drug her.
not that I would.
she's gonna be okay, right?
as long as she doesn't have to pick up or hold anything.
sorry, I just had the floors done.
reclaimed pine.
you always this thirsty?
I don't know.
water's supposed to be good for you, right?
dehydration, anxiety, aggression...
I'm not aggressive.
spastic chorea in his right hand.
what about my hand?
how much you weigh? About 180, 190?
180. What is the...
if you took what she did, it could take longer to hit you.
it might affect you differently.
but you didn't give her anything...right?
she was really drunk.
I just gave her some "e" to help enhance things.
have any of it left?
is my hand gonna be okay?
there's nothing wrong with it.
we lied.
I've had a sore throat for a few days now.
my stomach's also been bothering me.
I think my glands are swollen.
saint Nicholas?
patron saint of children.
also seamen, merchants, archers, prostitutes, and prisoners.
must have been pretty hard-working.
or just a credit hog.
open wide.
say ahh.
ahh...
you have strep.
is it contagious?
only for the next 24 hours, as long as you take the antibiotics.
how contagious?
take a personal day.
I can't.
I'll write your pimpa note.
my pimp?
you're tested for aids every three months, and your necklace.
prostitutes wear religious symbols.
I think they just like kneeling.
you don't have the skin of a seaman, the fingers of an archer, the clothes of a merchant, or the attitude of an ex-con.
so it just leaves one left.
two, actually.
but I'm not a child, am I?
well, give me your love, baby you owe me 50 bucks.
then you owe me half a lap dance.
it's for the nurses' holiday bonus.
I know you got the memo.
I got the memo last year.
I want to hire 40 more fellows.
you already fired the ones you hired?
they work better when they're scared.
you were right. Guy slipped her ecstasy.
he have any symptoms?
no.
Kutner's starting the patient on hemodialysis, and thirteen's in the lab trying to figure out what the guy put in the drugs.
see?
a clear, simple statement of facts describing their cooperation with absolutely no attitude or fear.
something's gotta be done.
Oh, yeah.
how are you feeling?
I still can't move my hands.
it'll take a few more hours to cycle all your blood through the machine.
what just happened?
nothing. What's wrong?
what do you mean? The lights just went out.
didn't they?
what did you do?
is this from the drugs?
most of the drugs should be out of your system by now.
and our drugs... - I can't see.
do something.
I can't see.
I can't see!
nothing in the ecstasy except ecstasy.
well, that never hurt anybody.
it can't make them blind days later.
do you spell "homie" with a "y"?
I want to be respectful.
you're actually gonna let us do secret Santa?
not just you guys.
I like presents too.
pick a name.
why are you doing this?
see, this is why no one likes your people.
the notion of picking one time of the year to be decent to other people is obscene, Because it's actually validating the notion of being miserable wretches the rest of the year.
so you think this is the part of the year that's screwed up?
on the other hand, you are now a team.
you've gotta work together.
and the simple fact is, giving people crap makes people like people.
so spend 25 bucks. Learn to love.
blindness could be a complication from the hemodialysis.
no, the dialysate composition was within range.
sweet.
interesting.
dialysate composition just indicates... - nothing.
I was referring to his reaction to the name he got.
I was pleased. I thought it would be fun to buy...
means there's someone here it wouldn't be fun to buy for.
I wonder who.
pick a name.
then go check out the patient's house.
interesting.
we're wasting time going to the home.
Kearns-Sayre syndrome fits the symptoms.
no family history of kearns. Go to their house...
she would have told us if there were any other drugs.
you met her. She couldn't have been more candid.
you're absolutely right.
go to their house...
M.S. or vascular problem fits better. They could affect hands and eyes.
fine, do an MRI, check for M.S..
and a fluorescein angiogram of her eyes to see if we missed a bleed somewhere.
Oh, and whoever goes to their house, get me their computers.
you talk to your kid about sex so she'll think you're being open about everything.
keeps her from asking questions about the things you don't want to talk about.
that's right.
her honesty proves just how dishonest she is.
Yes!
exactly who I wanted.
this is gonna be fun.
the dye may sting when it enters your bloodstream.
are you scared, mom?
Yeah.
are you?
Yeah.
are they?
they don't look scared.
either they're confident or they just don't care.
we're confident.
okay if I shift you a bit?
get you into position.
your boss is weird.
Yeah, he is.
he thought he'd get information you may not have been telling us by...
being a jerk?
you'd be surprised how often it works.
choroidal flush looks good.
why would people lie to a doctor?
dozens of reasons to lie, only one reason to tell the truth.
you're never even tempted?
I mean, lies do sometimes smooth things out, make life easier.
yeah?
your life easy?
not even close.
the dye has reached the retinal capillary bed.
no leakage.
that's good, right?
it means it's not a vascular problem.
what?
a vascular problem we could fix.
they look worried now, mom.
what's with the secret Santa?
you trying to bring them together?
I want to drive them apart.
with gift giving?
conflict's built right into the name.
Santa's about sharing.
a secret's about withholding.
aside from the Trojan horse, gifts don't usually...
what's you get your wife for your final anniversary?
uh...a sweater.
she hated it.
she loved it.
then you didn't buy it.
I gave her some cash...
and...
gifts allow us to demonstrate exactly how little we know about a person.
and nothing pisses off a person more than being shoved in the wrong pigeonhole.
Yes.
I'm thinking of spending a few extra bucks on my secret Santa.
bad idea.
you mind if I tell House you asked them for the key instead of breaking in?
Yes, I do. Just another five bucks.
five will be ten.
the key's proof she doesn't have anything to hide.
the key is proof I didn't do exactly what House told me to do.
and what do you care if it's another $15?
I'm gonna tell him.
who are you so anxious to please?
not you.
you really think you're going to prove people are capable of honesty using a mother and daughter you've known for one day?
I'm not the one who's based his entire world view on the proposition.
if I'm wrong, so what?
if he's wrong...
so you've got Huntington's?
Nope.
but house said that you... - if I wanted to talk about it, why didn't I bring it up?
Fuorescein angiogram was clear.
no leaks, no lesions.
definitely not a vascular problem.
someone get their birthdays out of the file.
have you tried leaving it blank?
tough to get into the head of someone who actually trusts people, huh?
found both computers in an office on a desk they share.
no sign of macular degeneration or optic neuritis.
her eyes are completely normal.
except she can't see out of them.
so she says.
find anything on the MRI?
no sign of plaques. It's not M.S..
we haven't found anything abnormal on any test.
except she can't see or move her hands.
so she says.
you can't lie about flaccid paralysis.
maybe she's not lying.
her brain is.
what if it's a conversion disorder?
lacks personal boundaries...
promiscuous...
inappropriate obsession with truth telling.
certainly sounds like a psych case.
cool, I'll set up a psych consult, start her on anti-depressants.
no.
her mind is tricking her body.
we need to trick her mind.
or even better.
you don't need her.
I know.
then this serves no medical purpose.
you have a genetic defect, choose to ignore it.
this woman has a genetic defect.
she chooses to butcher herself to be safe.
yet what you claim to be fascinated by is her honesty.
interesting.
you claim to want the truth...
and then you screw with people who actually live by it.
pathetic.
I gave you credit for "interesting.
you're protecting her because you're jealous she did what you couldn't.
I need you.
I'm not lying to her.
fine, keep your mouth shut.
I still need you.
if it doesn't work, you gotta hold the kid down until someone else finishes lying to mom.
that does actually serve a medical purpose.
I have to lie because she trusts me?
if you show doubt, the placebo treatment won't work.
if it's just depression, that's good news, right?
there are a lot of great medications.
then why can't we just give her those?
why do we have to lie to her?
because we might be wrong.
and those medications take a long time to work, and since you're mom's condition is declining...
there's a chance the drugs won't tell us anything until it's too late.
my mom's not depressed.
maybe she's hiding it from you.
no, she wouldn't...
she's doing what every good mom does:
protecting her child from bad news that she can't do anything about.
my mom never lied to me.
if you don't know how to lie, you don't know how to tell when you're being lied to.
maybe you're right.
I know... - I was lying.
I know how to lie.
I just won't do it to my mother.
you like footfall?
until the treatment of your infectious paraparesis takes effect, Jane can't come back into the room.
I've already been inoculated.
can she have it already?
don't worry, it's a very effective treatment.
you should be feeling better in a matter of minutes.
don't you think Jane deserves a few secrets?
some personal space... room to, uh...
make her own mistakes?
she makes plenty of mistakes.
only difference is I'm there to help her through them.
but she's gotta know you're looking over her shoulder.
it's gotta stifle...
I think the world would be a better place if everybody always acted like their mom was looking over their shoulder.
I want to go see my mom.
she's sleeping.
why don't we just double the amount we can spend?
Nope.
can't afford another $25?
if we allow people $50, people will spend $60.
Oh, so you can't afford another $35.
you must really like who you got.
or really dislike.
my mom always gives the best presents to the teachers I get along with the worst.
no. - No.
how do you know "no"?
know you didn't get House.
I know he didn't get House.
you gave them all your name?
figured I could sow some dissention and get a few ties and sweaters.
what happens when they find out?
it's secret Santa.
and what happens when they find out?
they'll argue about what to do with that information.
the ties are less important than the dissention.
we still have to buy him something.
not a chance.
we weren't supposed to discuss this. We're not supposed to know.
he's not supposed to put his name in there five times.
he wants presents.
it's sad.
it's pathetic.
I'm still buying him a present.
no, you're not.
fine!
what's wrong?
I think it's getting worse.
I can't breathe.
I need a nurse in here!
the lymph nodes are cutting off her airway.
we've got to intubate!
the swollen lymph nodes were cutting off Maggie's airway.
we shrunk 'em with alcohol. She's breathing on her own now.
that sucks.
4, 300 saved emails, and not a single mention of "lesbionic," "Sanchez," or "man-gina. "
swollen lymph nodes means it wasn't psychological.
who's that from?
Santa, obviously.
because you know I worship him.
no, wait, I mean Satan.
I always get 'em confused.
what is an alpine butterfly?
and why is she learning how to do one?
house, we already have a full history.
you don't need to waste time... - it's just a climbing knot.
but what does she use it for?
try bondage.
I did once.
she just tied me down and whined about how hard it is to be dean of medicine.
gyms aren't exactly pristine.
could be a fungal infection. Seriously, who's it from?
no fever, no elevated white count.
Ah!
that's funny.
her friend sent her a Garfield cartoon.
that cat sure does love lasagna.
stop obsessing.
if it weren't for my obsessions, you wouldn't know that she has sarcoidosis.
18 months ago she sold her stair master.
it was only two months old.
now, either she needed the cash, or climbing stairs was getting more difficult.
12 months ago, she canceled a hiking trip.
now, either she just wanted to sit home and watch TV, or walking was getting more difficult.
she's been suffering joint pain for the last two years.
pull my ribbon, if you know what I mean.
A.C.E. Levels are too low for sarcoidosis.
that's not what I meant.
could just be an inactive phase.
it's not Christmas yet.
I remembered I'm not a satanist, I'm a druid.
no lung involvement.
yet.
we'll need a bronchoalveolar lavage to confirm it.
that's a shame... I was gonna surprise her with one Christmas.
Wow!
now, either that cost more than 25 bucks or I'm seriously starting to doubt Steve Jobs' business strategies.
but thanks!
last round of saline, Maggie.
one more big breath.
we've gotta get the liquid to go all the way into your lungs, okay?
here we go.
the gift could be from a patient.
who sent it to the wrong doctor?
house obviously gave the present to himself.
they're arguing right now.
I've been looking for this all morning.
did you look in the box on my desk?
Oh, by the way, your mom called.
your dad's dead.
you left the present sitting on your desk?
it wouldn't have been as effective sitting in a closet in my home.
they're gonna know it's from you.
no, they're gonna guess that it was from me.
might even be 90% sure that it was from me, but all that means is they're 10% sure that one of the other guys is screwing them over.
have you ever considered channeling your powers to, I don't know, bring peace to the mid-east?
I couldn't do that.
but if they ever got it, you could screw it up?
Yeah, that's more where my powers lie.
gift could be from Wilson.
it's House.
why do you have a problem with him speculating?
because that's what House wants us to do.
lungs are pristine.
no infiltrates or alveolar hemorrhage.
Maggie, I'm gonna remove the scope.
I need you to cough for me, okay?
a little harder.
great.
Maggie, open your eyes.
why aren't you saying anything?
what's wrong?
Maggie tested negative for sarcoidosis.
but she's bleeding into her eyes now.
have her platelets dropped?
plummeted.
new labs show they're under 40.
she'll bleed out of every orifice if we don't find the cause.
could be splenic sequestration, tuberculosis...
gaucher disease, TTP...
hemolytic uremic syndrome, sepsis...
listing all the possible causesis only impressive if you can do it reverse-alphabetically.
we need to know why her platelet machine is broken.
go to the factory.
do a bone marrow aspiration.
I'm your secret Santa.
you're not supposed to tell.
but you got a present already.
which means you have more than one secret Santa.
or somebody else wants to make me happy.
merry Christmas.
baby, I wanna trim your baby, I wanna trim your baby, I wanna trim your beautiful Christmas tree one hand, you should be in bed.
and on the other hand, I told you to rest.
so I see your dilemma.
I don't think resting is the problem.
can strep cause this?
clap on...
trust me, first place I went.
no rash on my labia.
do you need to take a look?
I'm saving my money for a red ryder BB gun.
darker shade of lipstick?
I'm not wearing any.
you tell your mother what you do?
it doesn't matter.
I'm curious.
I don't need to break her heart just so I can feel righteous.
do you do a donkey show?
I'm not curious.
it matters.
it's a donkey or a mule.
I can never remember.
wow...
that is a creepy smile.
I bet the donkey's is even creepier.
do I have to explain?
Nope.
that's my job.
contagious ecthyma.
any contact can cause rashes, flu symptoms, sore throat.
has there been...
contact?
okay, antibiotic cream for you, and a love glove for francis.
you'll both be fine.
you should come see the show.
I think you'd like it.
sorry, I hate westerns.
so they really never lie?
doesn't seem like it.
admirable.
you tell Cameron everything?
no.
you think she keeps secrets?
if I knew, they wouldn't be secrets.
I hope she does.
people have a right to a little privacy, even from the people they love.
you buy House a present?
why would I?
to screw with me.
then I'm gonna say yes.
wait, wait, stop, stop.
what's that smell?
the bone is smoking.
her bones are harder than the drill?
we ran a full-body bone scan to find the cause of hardening in the hip.
no hot spots anywhere.
tracer could have been inactive.
so I screwed up the test?
there are so many ways that could have happened.
maybe it was inactive. Maybe it didn't fully circulate.
it circulated. The camera picked up...
Hey, hey...it's Christmas.
why are you guys fighting?
why do you think there are no hot spots?
I did not screw up.
the density's consistent.
it just means the density was consistent.
it doesn't mean it was cold.
it's possible all she has are hot spots.
it's consistent because her entire skeleton is turning to stone.
good for an aspiring superhero.
fatal for a human hoping to make it to Kwanzaa.
it's gotta be from a carbonicanhydrase type-ii deficiency.
it has free will...it doesn't have to be anything it doesn't want to be.
I meant, if it's not ca-2...
well, none of the other causes of osteopetrosis are treatable.
you're right. It's gotta be.
we'll run her blood and hope that your sunny optimism isn't misplaced.
they accused Kutner of screwing up a test because they hate him.
you're surprised?
that's the sort of crap that happens when you mess with people's heads.
one day he will screw up a test.
if they don't accuse him of that because they like him, someone could die.
where are we going?
nowhere, I just know it hurts you.
Ca-2 deficiency's a genetic disorder that scrambles proteins.
if the blood testis positive, you'll need a bone marrow transplant.
transplant sounds like a euphemism for slim odds.
uh, slim but not none.
we're gonna need to test Jane for a match.
don't you have donor banks?
Jane is your best bet.
the procedure's perfectly safe. There's no risk.
no risk!
any surgery has... - Then don't tell me there's no risk.
you gonna tell me there's no pain either?
the testing will hurt a little... - I'll be fine.
if she doesn't do this and you don't make it, she's gonna spend the rest of her life blaming herself.
mom...
please.
find someone else.
let someone else take the risk.
donor bank turned up a 49-year-old man in Cleveland who's a five out of six HLA match.
first flight out of Cleveland leaves at...
why is a 49-year-old Cleveland man a closer match than her daughter?
he may not be. Maggie didn't let us test her.
why not?
pain, danger, risk of...
the only reason to give multiple reasons is your searching for what the person wants to hear.
you were wrong about sainted mommy.
don't care. You can forget the donor bank.
there's no Ca-2 deciency.
best we can do is make her comfortable.
is that from taub?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
merry Christmas.
who's gonna tell the patient she's dying?
I will.
and nobody leaves here until we find out what killed her.
whatever she has is fatal.
makes no difference if it's disease number 58 or 907.
you guys mad at me?
Nope.
you had no choice.
of course I had a choice.
you had no choice once I made my choice.
and now I'm choosing not to be mad at you.
Why?
because it'll drive House nuts.
you think that'll make your lives better or worse?
I told my mom I don't care what she thinks.
want you to test my marrow.
I can't be dying.
sure, you can.
you're wrong.
you don't even know what I have.
what you have is one last Christmas with your daughter.
one last chance to give her a present...
the truth.
it's inexpensive.
highly valued.
never have to stand in line to return it the day after Christmas.
what are you talking about?
a mother who's going to die doesn't refuse a donor test because it might hurt.
she refuses when she knows it won't match.
which tends to happen when mother and daughter aren't mother and daughter.
I can do DNA tests if you'd rather keep lying to me.
I never wanted kids.
I love them, but with my genes...
I knew this woman.
a drug addict.
she got pregnant, didn't want to have an abortion.
but she also didn't want her daughter to ever know who her real mother was.
what she was.
I promised never to tell.
then a promise to an addict is worth more than a promise to your daughter?
it'd be cruel to tell her.
right.
she lives a lie, you get to die a hypocrite.
mom, the doctors told me what's happening.
it's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
I promise you.
doctors can be wrong.
there's still a chance I can beat...
do you really believe that?
I do.
no, mom, you're dying.
nobody can help you.
it's not going to be okay.
that was cold.
Yeah.
what do you get for Christmas?
I got a watch, a vintage lp, and a second-edition conan doyle.
and if that wasn't bad enough, my patient's dying.
Oh, Christmas deaths in a hospital... there's nothing more depressing.
no one ever wants to go in the patient's room.
even the candy stripers leave them alone.
but I saw something amazing.
pure truth.
she told her mother that she was dying.
stripped her of all hope.
that sounds...
horrible.
it was like watching some bizarre astronomical event that you know you're never gonna see again.
you tell people the cold, hard truth all the time.
you get off on it.
because I don't care.
she cared.
she did it anyway.
she did it because she cared.
the angels of Christmas have finally given house a present he can appreciate.
well, don't ruin it.
don't pin this on Christ.
he's got enough nails in him.
the patient had to die... - would you take off that hat.
it's Christmas.
it's a reindeer.
it's a moose on a jew.
who cares?
things have their place.
you wouldn't hang dreidels from a Christmas tree.
you could.
things don't care.
no, they don't.
happy solstice, House.
God rest you merry, gentlemen let nothing you dismay, remember Christ our savior was born on Christmas day to save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray...
don't you people know holiday spirit?
bring me the eggnog of good cheer.
house, if you have something to say, say it.
if you don't, give us a chance to get home before Santa.
Scrooge.
give the patient risperidone.
that's an anti-psychotic. She's dying.
she's not crazy.
I am going to perform a Christmas miracle.
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy...
you said all the other causes of osteopetrosis are fatal.
except for the one we discounted early.
because it was impossible.
when a fetus forms, it's just a mass of cells.
breast tissue covers an extensive portion of the body.
as the fetus develops, most of this tissue recedes, remaining only in the fun places.
but sometimes extra breast tissue is left behind in places where it doesn't belong.
risperidone does a lot of things.
one is it makes breast tissue swell, so we can find it more easily.
you're telling me I could have breast cancer...
somewhere not in my breasts? That doesn't make sense.
Taub's parents have a winter condo in Florida, but they're still new yorkers.
actually, my parents... - Don't care.
I told a parable.
now I'm going to raise the dead.
give me that syringe.
that's gotta be a fat depos it.
Yes, I could be wrong.
if i am, she's dead.
so shut up.
what's that?
risperidone also causes galactorrhea.
what's that... galac...galactic?
open your mouth.
relax, you've had it before.
I am not...
milk?
Eww!
we'll cut out your mom's tumor and start her on chemo.
all the rest of your symptoms should go away.
I love you.
I know.
have a wonderful life.
Mmm-mmm-mmm who took the merry out of Christmas whoa-o-oa people all over the world forgot about merry too busy fighting wars trying to make it to mars searching for light and can't seem to find the right star oh ho searching for light and can't seem to find the right star who took the merry out of Christmas? Ye-eah people all over the world forgot about merry too busy buying toys learning 'bout santa's joys who took the merry out of Christmas?
tell me now, y'all who took the merry out of Christmas?
he's got a good pulse.
maintain head stabilization and flip him over.
my count, guys. Ready. Go.
sir, we're paramedics.
the mailman saw you having a seizure.
we had to break down your door.
do you know what your name is?
on my count. One, two, three. Up.
we're taking you to the hospital.
no, I can't- no. No, I can't...
Hey, buddy. Buddy, we're trying to help.
sir!
stay out of my house!
you just had a seizure.
you could have a stroke. A bleed in your brain.
leave me alone!
35-year-old male- crushing headache and three seizures in the last two days.
so it's a bleed, clot, tumor, metabolic, or infection.
stick him in a CT. - Can't.
I'm assuming he has a giant head.
severe agoraphobe.
the world scares the hell out of him.
so we can only test him with whatever we can take to him.
fun.
agoraphobia a symptom?
only of being shot.
he and his girlfriend were mugged seven years ago. That's when it started.
anybody can hate humanity after getting shot.
takes a big man to hate it beforehand.
how'd you get this case if he didn't come to the er?
I talked to him through his door when he had flu last year.
I run the community outreach pgram now.
see? Perfectly reasonable explanation.
she's definitely not here trying to work her way back on the team and steal your job or anything.
it's a legitimate question.
he agreed to meet with us.
but even if I can get inside his house, his brain is a black box.
we can pick this up in a minute.
what's this?
take-out menus.
but I'm hoping you'll come up with a better answer when everyone asks what we're talking about.
last night- forget it.
I know this is awkward, but we need to talk.
there's a reason that we've evolved a feeling of awkwardness.
it tells us not to talk about things.
I was emotional because of the adoption falling through.
and you actually let your human side show for a moment.
that is why we kissed.
I just want to say thank you for not... taking advantage.
you're welcome.
any time you want to stop kissing, I'm there for you.
portable equipment can't distinguish a bleed or a tumor. Can't see vasculitis.
what did cuddy want?
I kinda hit that last night, so now she's all on my jock.
she looks pretty good for someone on roofies.
the only equipment we have is a sonogram and a portable x-ray.
what part of olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole don't you understand?
pyroxene.
pyro means "fire..."
they're indicator minerals.
you can't see diamonds so you look for the indicator minerals.
I assume the diamond is the tumor or bleed or whatever it is.
we provoke a seizure.
the indicator is the increased electrical activity focused around the abnormality.
we do an eeg, see the focus, see where the problem is, whh tells us what the problem is.
kickin' it old school.
thank god she's not trying to steal your job.
go do it. And search the home for toxins.
I agreed to talk, not let you in.
you could be very sick.
we need access.
I'm just not ready.
why does have two locked doors?
he must use this room as an airlock.
deliveries in. Garbage out. He never has to go outside.
just tell us when you are.
we're not going away.
Seriously?
you want her to admit that all he has to do is ignore us for a few minutes and we'll take off?
he was shot.
girlfriend killed.
he probably has post traumatic stress disorder.
he doesn't believe in a just universe. He doesn't trust anyone.
give him some host.
I shouldn't have implied we'd wait forever.
we've got a whole hospital full of patients.
we can give you a few minutes.
but eventually, if you don't let us in, we're gonna have to leave.
just one person comes in.
no. We've got to search the whole house for toxins.
how about I examine you in one room and my colleagues will do the search?
I'm gonna try to provoke a seizure.
I need you to look straight ahead, okay?
you all right?
Yeah. Uh, I just, um, I haven't been in a room with anyone for a while.
um, can you just give me a second? - Sure.
you're the, uh, uh, person I talked to through the door last year, right?
Yeah.
you were, uh, you were nice... and smart.
kind of made me expect someone older.
I'm not that young.
must've been scary being shot.
don't do that. Okay?
you d- you don't know me.
I've got everything I want here.
I-I-I make a lot of money writing tech manuals.
I get stuff delivered. I work out.
I see anything I want over the web.
um, I'm-I'm happy here.
you don't seem very happy.
well, right now I'm not.
go away.
did you speak to Cuddy last night?
she's fine.
why would it take anyone more than a few hours to get over misplacing a baby?
you spoke to her?
kinda hit that.
so she's all on my jock.
Wha--what?
everyone else thought I was kidding.
you hit? Like making out or full-on sex or
got a chart laid out with all the bases. I'll take you through it.
wh--what are you gonna do?
what can I do?
I'm going to ignore herfor the rest of my life.
this mosquito bite kept me awake.
don't care about the bug bite.
she's your boss.
so now I have two reasons to ignore her.
it was just a kiss.
there's a reason.
Yes. Those large things in her bra.
you were hiding it from me means it meant somethingto you.
Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it within the phrase "I hit that."
stop scratching. You'll draw blood.
finally you said something useful.
if I actually break the skin, it'll let the poison out.
if you... dated cuddy...there would
sorry. I get better reception when you're not here.
what do you got?
his place is totally clean.
no animals. No hidden drugs or alcohol. No lead in the paint.
and since you're not breathing hard,
I assume you're not holding cameron aloft in triumph. Which means no seizures.
speaking of breathing hard, cameron, you engaged to chase yet?
sorry, we should have clarified.
we're calling about the patient, not Cameron's love life.
we aren't engaged.
moves things along much faster to just give him the answers.
seizures can also be induced through-- - after six years?
a year and a half.
through sleep deprivation or-- - sleep deprivation would take too long.
you living together?
we spend most nights together.
there's a bunch of drugs that can lower a seizure threshold.
and cloud the diagnosis with side effects.
his place or yours?
his usually.
interesting.
you would've said interesting no matter what the answer.
and no matter what the answer, it would've been interesting.
no engagement. Commitment issues.
his place, control issues.
not sure whose, but interesting.
Yeah, moves much faster this way.
where was the patient when he had his first seizure?
in his entry hallway getting his mail.
getting close to the outdoors spooked him, raised his BP.
use that fear. Bring him outside.
he punched out a fireman.
we're doctors, not bouncers.
okay. So bring the outside to him.
floor is genuine wood.
why are they here?
they overheard me announce the half price bank fore closure in the er waiting room.
Where's everybody?
cameron's with the patient.
uh, everybody else went home.
because they don't need to be here.
neither do you.
and yet you are.
this way.
Molding's original?
original?
they were here before the house.
the shut-in's also original.
come on. Don't be shy.
house, get themout of here.
easy for you to say.
you're not gonna be making some serious capital gains.
this is cruel.
and leaving him undiagnosed is what, altruistic?
procedure worked. He's seizing. What do you see?
normal theta.
normal delta. This isn't a seizure.
it's something.
Mr. Nozick, are you okay?
stomach's killing me.
see? It's something.
partial small bowel obstruction.
blockage expins the pain.
what explains the blockage plus seizures?
atrial fibrillation throwing emboli.
crohn's causing an abscess.
could bea million things.
there's no way to know unless we get him in for an mri on his head or exploratory surgeryso we can biopsy his bowels, which he won't let us do.
wouldn't.
pain changes things.
he told you to stay out of here.
he can chase me out once he's done doubling up in agony.
whatever yr big problem is, it's caused a complication we call "colon fos." "Fo," full of.
since we're in mixed company,"s" is stool.
nothing's coming out so the pain's gonna get worse and worse.
we need to stick a pooper scooper in you.
we also need to take a look at your bowel.
I made my wishes clear.
and if the crazy fairy were here, she could grant them.
I'm not insane.
I-I feel pain when I go outside.
so it--it's rational to avoid that pain.
except now you're feeling pain inside.
not as bad. Nowhere near.
we can give him drugs for the blockage.
and if it doesn't work?
that blockage will rupture your intestines, spew sewage throughout your body.
whatever you're scared of out there, aren't you more scared of death?
you obviously can't stand people.
but for me, it's worse. All right?
I'd rather die in here than live out there.
if you don't mind floppy hair and an annoying accent,
I know a surgeon who will operate in your home.
thank you.
with the risk of infection, chase won't actually
he's not gonna do surgeryin some crazy dude's house.
you just said
what I said was that chase would put him under at the house, we'd take him to the hospital, open him up, do our thing, then slip him backinto his room for the post-op without him ever finding outthat we tricked him.
some of that was implied.
it's unethical. - He'll be asleep.
he gets to makehis own calls even if he's asleep.
why are you siding with him?
Oh, yeah, you're that girl who likes broken people because her husband died.
and since chase isn't all that broken
Hey, why don't we operateon his infarcted leg while we're at it?
who cares if he said no.
I was risking my life to avoid becoming a cripple.
he's doing it to avoid sunlight and fresh air.
we've got to make it look good.
I know I'm a pain in the ass.
I know it would have been easy just to walk away, but...
you're a good person.
count down from 10.
let's go!
how you doin'?
better. - Great.
everything else good?
uh, everything involving me kissing house is good.
Oh, god, you dragged it out of me.
you're a genius.
it's no big deal.
I was feeling vulnerable.
he's a friend.
and I leaned on him.
it's funny. I've leaned on friends in the past.
never leaned so far my tongue fell into their mouths.
I don't think of house that way. I never have.
why not?
you know exactly how it would go.
it'd start off exciting.
we'd get caught up in the novelty and the hostility and the forbiddenness.
and then we'd realize that the flirty hostility is just hostility and his inabilityto open up is no longer exciting, it's just frustrating.
and-and then it'sthe inevitable blowup and the recriminations and we don't talkfor two months.
Yeah.
well, it certainly proves you've never thought about house that way.
I get your point.
I will be more careful with my tongue in the future.
that's not my point.
maybe novelty and hostility and forbidden-ness doesn't have to end bad.
gotta go.
what time you done?
we could try that new sushi place next to my house.
why don't we stay at my house tonight?
we always stay at mine.
that's what I mean. We-we used to split it. What happened?
I don't know. Closer to work.
by five minutes.
anmy house doesn't look like it was decorated by a drunk rugby player.
well, we can discuss it. I hadn't really
why does it have to be a discussion? Can't you just stay over?
you do know they page me when that much surgical equipment is signed out.
he didn't consent. He consented to the surgery. You think he's gonna sue over where?
he won't even know where. He'll wake up in his house. He won't know a thing about what happened.
until he catches a post-surgical infection in his dirty apartmentand finds out we tricked him and winds up owningthe hospital.
why aren't you arguing with her?
because she's right.
I don't care where he gets the post-op, just that he gets it.
keep him here.
house. You okay?
Yes. We don't need to talk.
your hand.
that's weird.
I usually don't get the stigmata until easter.
please tell Dr. Chase the patient's ready for him now.
Stewart, wake up. It's Dr. Cameron.
if you can hear me, blink.
we were concerned for your safety so we brought you to the hospital.
no, it's okay.
Why-why?
no, it's okay. - Why...
I just wanted to keep you informed.
I didn't want you to have a bad shock while you were recovering from surgery.
gotta get outta of here.
it's okay, stewart. Calm down. Calm down. Stewart.
Stewart, I'm gonna sedate you.
I'm gonna sedate you.
No!
calm down.
I need some helpin here! Damn it! Somebody get in here!
what did you do?
well done.
your patientcalled his lawyer, threatened to sue us.
he's now heading home completely undiagnosed.
he'll soon be on his way back.
he's sick. He'll crash. He'll lose consciousness.
I'll declare an emergency, bring him back in.
not anymore you won't.
his lawyer now holds his health care proxy.
the next time we have an emergency, larry ruseckas, esquire, will be calling the shots.
I made the right call.
if he'd flipped out after major surgery, it would've been worse.
the benefit of being bossis that I don't have to argue.
you're all off the case.
what's going on between you and cuddy?
bad lovin' gone bad.
seriously. Why didn'tyou argue with her?
she just threw us off the case.
because ignoring her is a lot easier.
convince the patient to let us back in again.
see if you can clear his blockage with lactulose.
if this thing kills him before we can diagnose, it won't be fun anymore.
okay.
you gonna keep working on this?
Yeah. I brought in the case.
there is no case. He's gone. You've been tossed. This is totally nuts.
he's incredibly sick. We don't know
forget about the patient. What is going on with you?
this is why we left house's team to avoid this constant flood of pure craziness.
that's why I left house.
you got fired.
I'm sorry. I know I let you down.
but you know who else let down, pretty much everyone who's important to me.
my boss, my old boss, my boyfriend.
I did that for you.
I'm not gonna let you down again.
it's like the red badge of idiocy.
if the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have southern accentsand I'd be paying foreman less.
she kicked you off the case.
this is what happens when you don't address it.
she acts weird, things get different.
you understand that different implies difference.
she's tossed me a million times before.
no, she always chastises you.
and you'd always come running to complain.
so you're acting different too.
you're scared.
you are scared to get involved.
how is that "scared"?
it's rational.
emotionally mature people who work together should not de.
guaranteed breakup.
guaranteed ugliness.
any relationship that doesn't end in a breakup ends in death.
everything falls apart in the end.
that's your worldview.
the corollary, which you keep forgetting, is that you have to grab any chance for happiness.
why does this matter so much to you?
Cuddy and I are fine.
the only person getting worked up here is you.
I don't want you to be fine.
I want you to be happy. I think if you dated her
are you familiar with the adverb "vicariously"?
if I wanted to ask her out
you did ask her out. Last year. Whatever happened there?
I don't know. I wasn't interested.
wrong. You were interested.
but amber grabbed your genitals first.
but now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soonfor another relationship.
so you're gonna make me miserable.
please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something.
for me.
better or worse?
worse. Drugs aren't working.
I think we should do the surgery in his house like we planned.
well, then one of us wasn't paying attention because I thought that surgery thing was just a trick.
we prepared the room. We hung the drapes.
it's probably ten times as sterile as any mobile operating theater you'd find in a battlefield.
we still need trapper john.
chase doesn't want any where near this surgery.
maybe you could talk to him.
I can't understand a word he says.
doing anything later?
blood in the field.
not where I'm looking.
how am I supposed to know where you're looking?
here's a hint. It's the bloody part.
the whole thing's bloody. It's a guy with a hole in his body.
it's like you've neverdone this before. Use the ction.
I will.
and in fact I've never done this before because I went to med school, not nurse school.
Hey, wanna see if your client's actually made of money?
cutting out last piece of bowel.
suture.
mucosa's pink.
flattened villi.
intestinal atrophy.
it's whipple's disease.
explains the seizure and the stomach pain.
little bleeder here.
cautery.
Hey, wait. The gas
that always happensduring surgery.
just the gas build up in the blockage.
nothing to sue about.
treat him for the burns.
put him on antibiotics for the whipple's.
he'll be fine.
that's nice of you.
he doing good?
uh, burns are healing fine. He's stable otherwise.
good. So, uh, I could stay at your place tonight if you'd like.
I can't.
well, you're not gonna sleep here again.
you might have noticed the lack of nurses.
because you're not on the case.
you can't really use that as an excuse...
Dr. Cameron! - Wait here.
your stomach?
my legs are numb.
I can't feel them at all.
new symptom. Peripheral neuropathy. Got worse on antibiotics. It's not whipple's.
porphyria. - Liver's fine.
amyloidosis.
we would've seen it on the intestines.
what did we seeon the intestines?
pink mucosa, flattened villi.
it's not whipple's, it's gotta be celiac.
wheat allergy mean she's not absorbing nutrients.
explains the seizures, stomach, and now the nerves.
we should run a blood test for celiac.
not fast enough. Not accurate enough.
force-feed him wheat then do an endoscopy as it hits his duodenum.
see if there's an allergicreaction.
his guts just exploded.
it might be a tad painfulto make him eat.
that's house's point.
there's nothing diagnostic about it.
he's trying to put the patient in pain, force him to come in.
it is a lid test.
so is the blood test, which is painless.
Foreman, listen to that little voice in your head that's comingfrom the telephone.
force-feed him.
don't.
you know house. You know I'm right.
we'll do both tests.
I'm not here to play matchmaker.
okay.
house basically...
well, he accused me of being interested in you.
Oh, he's just tryingto change the subject.
I know. But I do have...
I've always... had... some feelings for you.
are you sayingyou want to date me?
no. I-I-it wouldn'tbe fair to house and it's too soonafter amber.
but you thoughtyou should just say it.
Yeah. I thought you should know.
let's have dinner tomorrow night.
okay.
or maybe it would be better if we just... had sex.
pardon me?
in front of house's office.
I mean, I don't want to take any chances.
I assume the point of thisis to make him jealous and make him realize that he does want a relationship with me?
Yes.
you think it'll work?
you're an idiot.
trust me.
everybody will be happier if house and I aren't dating.
you sure this is the best test?
no. But you've kind of tied our hands.
soon as this hits your intestines, I'll look at it through an endoscope.
Stewart, I know you don't want to talk about this, but...
people who get shot often get ptsd.
it's nothing to be ashamed of.
it's very treatable with drugs and therapy.
it's not ptsd.
my girlfriend was with me when I got shot and she died.
I'm sorry.
but that's what I mean. I lost someone myself.
I know it's traumatic.
no, what--what--what I'm tryingto say is that...
I was like thisbefore the shooting.
since I was a kid.
everything was hard for me.
I--I didn't go out that much. And--and when I did...
I had panic attacks.
like physical pain.
no, it was, like, worse. It was like I was dying.
then I met angela.
she was the only reason that I ever wanted to go out.
but then she died. And...
blood test will be done soon.
I'm guessing that's a new technique.
Hey, you remember that idea that cameron had about trying to torture the patient into admitting himself?
pretty sure it was your idea.
you want me to slow down the test?
everyone's got all these great ideas today.
so you're thinking patient won't leave because leaving causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful.
that actually makes sense.
you'll increase his pain, but not enough to make a difference.
he's on morphine.
he's on morphine now.
pretty soon he'll be on less-phine.
cause when you restock, you'll actually be giving cameron iv bags of saline.
and why do you think I'll be doing this?
same reason you did the surgery.
that was because it was an emergency.
no.
it was because your marriageis falling apart.
when you confess adultery, things tend to go bad.
when one part of your life does a titanic, you make a life raft out of whatever's left, which makes your jobmore significant, which is why you didthe surgery, why you pulled an all-nighter, and why you'll do this.
she's having me sleep on the couch.
just for a few nights.
I'm not doing this to save my job.
I'm doing this to save his life.
right. That's what we'll tell everyone.
have you considered that it's not my place you really want to be walking into right now?
Ric ocasek would kill me if I-- oh, you mean cuddy.
Yeah, she's a little nuts.
but she's beautiful, smart, funny, and most important, she can stand you.
Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on cuddy, not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment.
house, there is no mosquito.
this is all about cuddy.
Ah, she's bugging me.
poetic.
have you seen this bug?
have you seen this bite?
no. What I've seen is a suppurating wound that you've scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state.
delusional parasitosis.
I am not imagining things.
house, you're a drug addict.
you're always imagining things.
you got bitten the night you kissed her.
your itching always gets worse when you think about her.
you need to address this.
she's my boss.
no, you're not afraid of authority.
you're afraid she actually is right for you.
you're afraid to take a chance because it's too big a chance.
if it doesn't work with her, then maybe there's no one out there.
I am not rationalizing.
I'm better off alone.
also, you seen her assrecently?
you're not staying here.
Oh, come on. - No. You can go home.
or you're going to Cuddy's, gonna ring her doorbell, and you're gonna ask her out on a date like regular people do at 3: 00 in the morning?
when do regular people sleep? - Buh-bye.
is he in enough pain to come in yet?
no.
antibody tests back?
inconclusive.
then why are you here?
I missed you.
endoscopy?
inconclusive.
well, then do it again.
I know it sucks, but I need to test your stomach again.
it's really hurting.
I know. I'm sorry.
try to get you on your back and have you open your mouth.
I can't...
he's out. Anything?
no pulse. Start cpr.
get the paddles. Get the paddles! Who are you calling?
pizza. You like anchovies?
I'm calling the lawyer. Genuine emergency.
he'll okay admission. - He's dying.
exactly.
sorry to wake you.
your introvert is having a heart attack.
if we don't restart his heart...
he can survive 15 minutes on oxygen and CPR.
we can get him to the hospital in five.
lawyer says yes. Continue CPR.
2123 holden green. Patient with P. E. A.
clear. - Wait!
I got a pulse.
cancel the ambulance.
he's stable enough to stay here.
his heart's back to sinus rhythm, but it's bradycardic.
Taub's putting in a temporary pacemaker.
it'll keep his heartbeating for now.
Hey, cameron, how would you likeyour old job back?
I'm asking 'cause it's the only way I can fire you.
sorry.
in ER, we like to actually resuscitate dying people, not just let them flop around.
could be lymphoma.
we'd have seen it on the abdomen.
it has to be a poison.
organophosphates.
we checked the place over and over.
it's completely clean.
there are rose petals in the front entry.
unless he's eating a bouquet a day, he couldn't
how clean? - Very.
he probably has a little OCD.
how often do you wash your tub?
every couple days.
bleach and ammonia?
Yeah.
you know how kids play toy soldiers in the bath?
he likes to re-enact the battle of ypres three times a week with real gas.
ammonia and bleach makes chlorine gas.
highly fat soluble.
he lost weight after the stomach pain.
explains why his symptoms kept getting worse.
put him on parenteral steroids and sodium bicarbonate.
even if you're right, that external pacemaker's gonna fail eventually.
and I don't have the skills to put in a permanent one.
well, maybe the poison hasn't completely shot his heart.
and you won't have to feel guilty for the rest of your life.
how am I gonna place the leads in the exact spot on the right ventricle without fluoroscopy?
the force?
Taub put in the temporary one.
you can do that playing pin the tail on the donkey.
permanent pacemakers need precision.
so we can use the portable x-ray.
it's not real time.
sonogram.
and what happens when I put him into v-tach because the sonogram isn't precise enough?
he's dying.
exactly why I don't want to be the one to kill him.
Thanks.
you knew I'd have to say no.
but you came anyway.
you just wanted a reason to be angry at me.
if there's something wrong between us, then- forget it.
you know why we spend nights at my house?
because when we spend themat yours...
I could tell you didn't want me there.
why would I keeping viting you over if I didn't want you there?
you always kicked me out every morning.
you never offered me a drawer.
you never cleared out your closet for me.
I was just a visitor.
how long have you felt like this?
from the start.
I know it's hard for you because you lost your husband, but...
I can't keep chasing youforever.
I just tried your house. Where are you?
clubbing. Good or bad?
bad. Vitals are dropping.
the abdominal painkeeps getting worse.
means we were too late with the treatment.
tell the lawyer he's off the clock.
we're done.
you're giving up?
call Taub.
tell him to pick up some morphine.
there's no need for the patient to be in pain.
he's on morphine.
no. He's on saline.
I figured you put himon saline so I switched him back to morphine.
I love you.
when you reach puberty, give me
his abdominal pain. That was on morphine?
Yes.
is there something that causes abdominal pain that doesn't respond to morphine?
I was right.
he is being poisoned.
what's this density on his hip?
just bone.
think less boney.
you think he's got lead poisoning?
explains the constipation, the nerves, seizes.
hold him down.
you're not gonna feel a thing...
except excruciating pain.
the mugger used hollow points.
they exploded and left fragments.
your doctors missed a couple hiding behind your hip bone.
it's no biggie.
except years later, they started to dissolve, and then, biggie, you started to dissolve.
I'll start him on chelation.
the agoraphobia, could it
no. Lead wouldn't have started to disintegrate till years after.
but it could have exacerbated the fear.
I don't need to change.
I know you think that.
but your life could be better.
You-you-you'd have choices.
he's lying.
about what?
about everything. About his life.
he doesn't even think he's happy here. He's miserable.
I've got everythingI need. - Yeah?
well, then why did Taub find rose petals in your entry hallway?
struck me as a little weird.
thought it might be medically relevant.
but it actually just told me that you were pathetic.
the day you crashed in your entry way...
was your girlfriend's birthday.
you weren't there for the mail.
you were trying to go lay flowers on her grave.
Yeah, he's got PTSD.
Yeah, he's agoraphobic.
he's also a coward.
you want to change your life, do something.
don't believe your own rationalizations.
don't lock yourself up, pretend you're happy.
you were right. About my husband. It affected me.
it still affects me.
if you're saying you'll never be able to
I cleaned out a drawer for you.
like a big one.
I'm in love with the finest girl in the world I didn't know I could feel this way .Think about her all the time , always on my mind I didn't know about love all that a man should do is true all that a man should do is true. I'm in love with a girl, finest girl in the world, I didnt know this could happen to me
deaf PRIDE 145 pounds! Johnson! Miller!
I know you're not asleep.
that insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren't just a product of my exhausted brain.
aren't you curious about why I'm here?
curious why no French maid's outfit.
no spanky pants.
I'm a hallucination... not a fantasy.
it's insomnia. Four nights without rem sleep can cause...
that might explain why you're hallucinating.
doesn't explain why you're hallucinating Wilson's dead girlfriend.
probably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.
or maybe your guilt of Kutner's suicide reminds you how guilty you felt about me.
who cares why you're here?
a decent night's sleep, you won't be.
guess I'll be around a few more hours.
need some coffee?
addictive substances are no substitute for nature's healing balm.
let's make this fast. I need to sleep.
deaf 14-year-old started hearing imaginary explosions.
exploding head syndrome. Cool.
well, obviously his brain knows how to hear.
patient went deaf at age four. Complication of meningitis.
so why no cochlear implant?
usual suspects are insomnia, which he doesn't have, migraines, which he doesn't get, and head trauma which didn't show up on the ct.
damn imaginary pen.
mom's signature's on everything. Dead Dad?
no, I doubt it. He was a sperm donor. Medical cords couldn't be cleaner.
so we're left with temporal lobe seizure. - Wrong.
someone at the wrestling meet would have noticed a seizure.
could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg.
put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.
you're gonna ignore your own subconscious?
gonna be the limp leading the blind.
I need a 'scrip, for sleeping pills.
my neighbor's dog's been keeping me awake, and seems strangely invulnerable to poison.
why is the soon-to-be-second-prettiest Dr. Chase here?
I'll take that as a congratulation.
we're discussing a case.
why did he close that file?
wedding in two weeks?
I'd say you were pregnant, but I don't think Chase's body is mature enough to produce sperm.
it's a small ceremony. Why wait?
nighty night.
drugs with no lecture? He wants you out.
interesting case?
possible prostate cancer came into the E. R.
pencil cup.
no wonder his prostate's enlarged.
it's full of pool cues and cigars.
chase's best man doesn't get here till the day of the wedding, so I asked Wilson to throw his bachelor party.
no retired ministers available to plan it?
chase doesn't want some big, raucous party.
so she says.
luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what's right.
no, no, no, I don't want--I don't want you to
listen, two things I do well.
bachelor parties rank towards the top.
I get to help, right?
starting five hertz.
house made it through that entire differential without mocking our patient for not having a cochlear implant.
the patient doesn't want an implant because he's comfortable with who he is.
it's admirable.
he's deaf. It's not an identity, it's a disability.
it's also a culture. The deaf have their own schools, their own language.
still no spiking. - Going to 20.
anything I can simulate with a $3. 00 pair of ear plugs is not a culture.
no sign of seizure. Temporal lobe activity is still clean.
doctors... doctors, he can't see. One of his eyes.
the limp leading the blind.
is that supposed to mean something?
I didn't think so.
so exploding head syndrome, plus vision loss.
subclavian steal syndrome.
vascular defect coupled with constant arm movement could siphon blood flow from the brain.
we should do an angio, check his-- Knock yourselves out.
how did I know he was gonna go blind?
don't get cute, Gazoo. You're in my mind. You're obviously there.
c-reactive protein.
I noticed in his file it was slightly elevated.
I figured the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation even higher, lead to optic neuritis.
that's a lot clearer than "the limp leading the blind."
it was just a glimmer. I couldn't put it into words.
it was a long shot.
I don't even remember the C-reactive protein level.
obviously you do. You just don't know it.
how high is K2?
I don't know. - Me neither.
but I read a book about it years ago.
fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, being over-- - 28, 251 feet.
cool.
an all-access pass to my own brain.
go play the kid some music. - Why?
another long shot.
we're using iodine dye to track blood flow in your neck and arm.
house, what are you doing?
what does it look like I'm doing? Fighting the power.
feel that? How cool is that?
apparently your mom doesn't care what you're missing.
you're an ass.
he says he feels the vibrations in his abdomen, but not his hands.
what does that mean?
it's a new symptom. Neuropathy.
thought you were gonna get some sleep.
case got interesting.
like the zoo.
except you can bang on the glass as much as you want.
how did you know about the neuropathy?
good question.
enough with the riddles.
tell me about it.
think wrestling record.
juggling.
no, pins. Three pins.
patient was pinned in his last three matches.
leading up to that, he was 15 and 0.
I figured his balance was off from diminished sensation.
could be increased ICP from a brain tumor.
that we missed on the head CT?
cutting weight for wrestling could have led to rhabdomyolysis.
he just went up a weight class three months ago.
Foreman's right.
actually, increased ICP could make sense.
you just said-- - I was processing.
it also puts a new symptom on the table.
his deafness.
what if it was caused by nf2 cancer instead of his childhood meningitis?
so meningitis was a coincidence?
or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system.
MRI his head.
if you're right about nf2, his deafness may be reversible.
I'll set it up and talk to the patient.
you two... doing anything?
you know what a broken cowboy is?
it was on House's list of requirements.
I have three theories.
why is House so into this bachelor party thing?
he needs to have a reason to be into a bachelor party?
he needs a reason to be into anything.
give me your wallet.
house could be trying to tempt Chase into cheating. Break them up.
you think House is into Cameron?
I think House is into Cameron being into him.
marrying Chase would shatter that fantasy.
if Chase cheats, then they shouldn't be getting married in the first place.
so you're okay with House getting Chase smashed enough to make a stupid mistake?
being drunk doesn't change who you are. It just reveals it.
you think she can do the broken cowboy?
God, I hope so.
NF2 is an extremely slow-grown cancer, which makes it very treatable.
if we're right, taking out the tumor means there's a chance you'll regain your hearing.
no. He said you have to.
what's wrong?
he wants you to treat the cancer, but leave him deaf.
uh, sorry. Doesn't work like that.
imaging shows slightly elevated ICP, but no masses on or around the nerves.
it's not cancer.
slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle.
could still indicate a tumor.
we brought pictures.
the fact that you sent me on a scouting mission.
no skirts.
you're not on the guest list.
bachelor parties are an ancient and sacred male rite of passage.
the ventricle bowing is most likely a pre-existing anatomical anomaly, not the indication of a tumor.
no way to know for sure without a brain biopsy.
if I get drunk enough, there's a chance I might make out with one of the strippers.
or become one.
sold.
we can't just drill into our patient's brain on a hunch.
Oh, god, not her.
she's the one that got me hooked in with Madoff.
Taub's right. It's not cancer.
Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it's difficult to prove.
do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle.
or an older look.
the mom's never gonna let us touch his brain without some evidence.
patient broke his nose years ago. Hospital could have done an MRI.
okay.
the main reason my third wife and I eloped was to avoid House's bachelor party.
have you seen Caligula?
my patient's brain now... versus three years ago. See any difference?
is he telling you to avoid the party?
I took an oath to do no harm.
sure, don't come.
if you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.
this should be interesting.
you are going to commit to that one special woman forever, which is beautiful.
but if your commitment the day after the wedding is the same as your commitment the day before, then the wedding meant nothing.
so, and I see no logical way around this, if you want your marriage to matter, you have to be a wanton, trolling, muck-covered pig the day before.
you're evil. See ya.
the wall of the fourth ventricle changed. It isn't bowed in the older scan.
evidence of NF2, right?
you'd need to do a brain biopsy to confirm.
uh, I'm not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties, I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.
that whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.
I'm not going.
okay. - It's not okay.
do you know who we need?
that stripper you got for Wilson's bachelor party.
you could do body shots right off her.
why go back to that well?
in the nine years since Wilson's party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers.
she loved cats.
what made you remember the stripper loved cats?
chase has a cat. They'll bond.
ahem, House? You, uh, entertaining yourself up there?
just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What'd you find?
the biopsy shows nerve inflammation consistent with increased intracranial pressure.
something's wrong, but it's not cancer.
he's gonna go through life deaf.
he's okay with that.
he has no idea what he's missing.
his mom's a moron.
he's gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life?
are we okay with that?
why are you closing? Let's put in a cochlear implant.
that wasn't in the paperwork.
Really? Well, someone must have screwed up. I'll go track it down.
I'll wait. - That's a great idea.
let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open.
I'll wait.
I have been known to lie to serve my own agenda.
an implant does absolutely nothing to help me diagnose him.
let's get an implant tray in here.
just-- just try to relax.
just during the recovery phase...
her son didn't want the implant.
if he still doesn't want it after having time to adjust, I'll take it out.
I'll blind him too, if he wants to experience that culture.
remove it now.
kid's just had brain surgery. He's not stable.
ms. Miller, I'm not trying to minimize Dr. House's wrongdoing.
but the best thing... - Why is she sitting?
she's not yelling, not threatening, not pacing. Just sitting.
understand, Dr. House?
house! Focus.
I need you to say you accept the arrangement.
no problem. You're not mad.
I'm mad.
not mad enough.
you wanted your son to hear.
you just didn't have the guts to make him get the implant.
once my son is stable, I want that thing out of his head.
why did you do this?
because he is ignorant, and he's being raised by an idiot.
not good enough.
you always have
my patient is opting into a handicap!
it's an insult to all the other gimps out there.
okay.
but I'm still putting Foreman in charge of the case.
that's the arrangement?
okay.
you're okay with Foreman in charge?
who you calling?
right, you don't want to look like a lunatic.
Yeah, about that...
you think we did the wrong thing?
I'm not sure.
I'm not even sure why we did it.
well, that argument you made to Cuddy sounded pretty good.
to you, maybe.
I figured by now you'd be at the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.
Yeah, you did something stupid.
quick, better mock someone. - Why did you do it?
why did I give a human being the power of hearing?
you ask God the same question, he'll give you the same answer.
patient has a fever now too.
probably just a post-op complication.
Arnold-Chiari? - Not without muscle weakness.
pseudotumor cerebri?
we checked his eyes before the surgery. No papilledema.
candy?
I'm pretty sure Wilson's stripper's name was something sweet.
maybe his fever is more than the post-op reaction.
his girlfriend was sick a few months ago.
maybe her flu was really Epstein-Barr. - Lolli?
they swap spit, virus travels to his brain, leads to meningitis, - leads to increased intracranial pressure. - I agree. Taffy?
I agree.
go ahead, start him on ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.
keep making decisions like that.
it really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.
why aren't you in my office?
because I know what the word "my" means.
I did something insane, and you're not all over me analyzing why.
it was nice.
I gave that idiot an implant to prove to him what an idiot he's been. How is that nice?
you didn't do it to solve the case. You didn't do it to save his life. You... did it to make his life better.
it was a caring act.
which you did in a way that was... immoral and illegal, but... baby steps.
doesn't sound like us.
you can't make me go to the bachelor party.
I know.
and you're okay with that?
what choice do I have?
please, God.
Yes.
I think he just wet the bed.
the kid's dehydrated, but stable.
thankfully, the fountain of whiz seems to have stopped for the moment.
not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table.
now eat up.
we're gonna pick out the ice cream flavors for the bachelor party.
could be systemic autoimmune disease.
Sarcoidosis-- this tastes like... vodka.
well, it'd be stupid if it tasted like bourbon.
that's the brown one. - It is vodka?
flash frozen in a secret process.
guy figured it out in his basement.
Lemoncello. Genius.
symptoms came on too hard and too fast.
sarcoidosis is progressive.
remember in med school when Donovan gave grand rounds?
three was that guy who was peeing liters.
Glomerulonephritis?
a wrestler--steroids could have damaged the kidneys.
hmm, the scotch is nice.
his urine would have been brown.
Donovan ruled out osmotic diuresis-- kidney disease.
Pheochromocytoma?
no hypertension. Plasma metanephrine's normal.
it happened at night. That was the clue.
night, recumbent body position, changes in B. P.
it's his heart.
run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours.
foreman concurs.
what the hell just happened?
everything started to fade away.
you're getting better at focusing.
ignoring everything that doesn't matter.
he looks pissed.
I think he might hit us.
is your eyesight better than mine?
we need to talk about the bachelor party.
excellent topic choice.
surgery's so boring, and my lying to you is just so yesterday.
it's my fault for letting you talk me into the implant.
cameron is not gonna be happy about this party.
but you, on the other hand...
plan on spending the rest of my life with Cameron.
so... I need to cancel the fart band?
so... I need you to kidnap me.
spoken like a true Aussie.
by the way, if you know where I can get me the sheet music to Waltzing Matilda...
want some ice cream?
we're having a sundae bar.
sweet.
that's her name.
sundae or bar?
Karamel.
with a K.
bathroom?
down the hall, two doors on your right.
thank you.
do I... sound like... her?
it takes time.
you still haven't slept?
and then I have a clever response.
EKG, normal sinus, normal intervals.
his heart's fine. - His heart's not fine.
the heart was fine during this test.
the arrhythmia's hiding.
or we were wrong about the heart.
could be the thyroid.
hashimoto's would explain the kid's urine and brain pressure.
treadmill.
or the arrhythmia is hiding.
we need to stress him. Put the patient on a treadmill.
the patient just had brain surgery.
a stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.
I value your opinion.
I value rejecting your opinion.
you're not doing this. You haven't been sleeping.
Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge.
she just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.
and if I let you risk our patient's life testing an organ we already tested, we accomplish neither.
run a thyroid panel.
how do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman's sign-off?
we could kill Foreman.
is she new?
focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it's not simulated?
we could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.
that's a tough sell. She never leaves the room for more than five minutes.
we could kill her. Or... asthma meds.
force the heart to beat faster.
revealing the arrhythmia.
nice idea. - It was yours.
I just left the room for a few minutes.
he ripped out his implant.
so much for improving his life.
actually, I think we just saved it.
look at that. Arrhythmia.
you were right about the heart.
should have listened to you.
the correct phrasing would be, I should always listen to you.
he's got problems everywhere. What goes everywhere?
blood. Could be thrombocythemia.
excess platelets lead to clotting throughout the body.
not with a normal platelet count.
so the clotting doesn't start in the blood, it starts in the lungs--pulmonary embolism.
should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear.
go.
you sure I did this at Wilson's party?
the last time, you used grain alcohol instead of the sambuca.
and it worked?
explains my lack of eyebrows by the end of the evening.
by the power of Greyskull, I
this is why we're rehearsing.
ever wonder what's happening every time our patient gets sicker?
not right now! - First symptom, wrestling.
then, under the lights of the seizure lab.
are you going somewhere with this, because this feels
just keep doing what you're doing--it helps.
then, under the stress of blindness... and post-op fever.
what do all the symptoms have in common?
heat.
see, if you hadn't been here, that would have just popped into my head.
which actually would have been way cooler.
Foreman, kid's got Uhthoff phenomenon. Which means it's MS.
start him on double-dose interferon.
let's get our drink on.
not before I've added "chemical burns" to this guy's cause of death.
well, the patient's responding to interferon.
looks like I can retire as department figurehead.
Dr. Robert Chase.
we're with the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.
did you recently apply for a marriage license?
Yes.
according to our records, your work permit is expired.
if you could come with us.
um, I'm his fiancee. I can come along and clear this...
I'm sorry, ma'am. Illegals only.
I'm--I'm sure it's a mistake.
I'll call you as soon as I know what's going on.
don't let House get him in too much trouble.
allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life.
now, aha, a few ground rules for the evening.
uh, safety is job one.
we've now gone 18 days without an injury in the workplace.
uh, yes, these girls are all working their way through law school.
don't test them. - House!
I knew you couldn't stay away.
this is my apartment. You can't do this.
clearly, reality begs to differ.
Where's my furniture?
out back somewhere. - James!
how's your wife?
we--we got divorced.
how is your cat? - Dead.
how 'bout we go have a drink?
okay.
you're okay with this?
I paid 50 bucks for this.
you guys are great together. Trust is everything.
I gotta get some air. Keep it real.
you should be out there... joying the lap dances of your labors.
eh, I kind of like it in here.
me too.
to us figuring out M. S.
and the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did.
what exactly did my team do?
look good in their lab coats.
except for Taub.
some people just work better alone... so to speak.
one more drink. - No! I can't!
I need to take a break.
meet Karamel.
maybe one more drink.
what's that taste?
is that-- is that strawberry?
house, you in there?
use the other bathroom. It's in the kitchen. Looks like a sink.
chase went into anaphylactic shock from the stripper's body butter or something.
is he okay?
one of the residents had an EpiPen, so he's fine.
we're taking him to the hospital to be safe.
okay.
I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn't I?
that's why you wanted Karamel at this party.
I suggested Karamel 'cause she was great at Wilson's party.
I knew about her body butter and about his strawberry allergy.
I tried to kill Chase.
why would I do that? I don't want Cameron.
you're not a big fan of other people's happiness, either.
hello.
you confirm? Thanks.
that kid we saved... he's dying.
it's not M. S. We were wrong.
thank God you're okay. What happened?
it was a good-- - Uh, long story.
your patient's lung failure rules out M. S.
we put him on a ventilator.
uh, enlarged lymphs could-- - Are any of you sober?
turn around. You need to go to the hospital.
I need to sleep.
I'm you.
you can't just shut a door.
you tried to kill Chase.
need to push you back down.
you're dangerous.
that's the hospital.
not answering.
hello.
I'm here with your team, trying to sober them up so they can... help treat your dying patient.
Foreman's dying patient.
what causes lung failure plus your patient's previous symptoms?
eosinophilic pneumonitis.
white blood cells accumulate, clog up the lungs, lead to heart problems.
it fits.
house, are you there?
it's not eosinophilic pneumonitis.
I gotta crash. - House, don't hang up. We need your help.
I can't. - We can solve this.
good night.
eosinophilic pneumonitis could actually make sense.
no, House ruled it out because it would affect the larynx. Patient would be... hoarse, which we wouldn't notice in a deaf kid who rarely speaks.
wait. Everyone's getting breath mints.
we need to hear Seth speak.
but that means taking out the tube. Isn't that dangerous?
it's the safest way to confirm what's wrong with him.
I need him to breathe out as I pull on the tube. - Okay. Breathe out.
say, "ah."
I'm sorry. We were wrong.
I need to, uh, suction out your throat before we reintubate.
your son smoke?
smoke? I don't think so.
tobacco stains on his teeth.
he says he used to chew tobacco to cut weight for wrestling.
used to?
chewing tobacco wouldn't explain his symptoms.
but not chewing tobacco might.
Taub was right. It's sarcoidosis.
the tobacco releases toxins.
those toxins suppressed his immune system.
once he quit chewing, the absence of those toxins kicked a dormant condition into hyper-drive.
is it treatable?
usually responds to corticosteroids and methotrexate.
I'll start the meds.
I need sleeping pills.
I was gonna hit up Wilson, but he's not answering his phone.
he must have left it in his pants.
which he wasn't wearing when the police found him trying to walk home... oddly, from his own apartment.
pills.
your patient's doing fine.
thanks to your team.
it wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it?
sarcoidosis. - Good.
house, please talk to me.
I haven't slept through the night since Kutner killed himself.
the wrestling might have to wait.
I'm gonna tell your doctors to repair your implant.
and then you ripped it out rather than live with it for a few days, even.
I'm your mother. This is my call.
I don't know if I'm making the right one.
but it's mine to make.
sleep well?
the car's full of gas.
you sure?
and if I'm not?
you'll be paying me back for those damn invitations.
Oh, well, then never mind.
Ted is a wonderful man, dad.
he's the second greatest guy I ever met.
guess that's us.
into this Holy estate, these two persons present now come to be joined.
and so if any person may show just cause why they may not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
that's what I like to hear.
do you, Theodore Philip Taylor, take Nicole Margaret Murray to be your wife and promise before God and these witnesses to be her loving and faithful husband, in plenty and in want, in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live?
I - - I- - This isn't funny, Ted.
are you all right?
what time is it?
happy time.
I'm still asleep.
just think of this as a dream.
what about House?
I said a dream, not a nightmare.
he's in the next room.
sound asleep.
I met the neighbors.
sir, do you know this man?
I don't need a temporary. I need a permanent.
yesterday.
please do.
good morning. - Hardly.
one of my P.A.s quit an hour ago, and I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.
that's nothing. I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.
any bed you're in is the wrong one.
that's not what your mama said.
I'll be going now. To human resources.
he started it.
it was the neighbor's kid's bed.
luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy.
how drunk were you?
about yea drunk.
are you okay?
you shouldn't be drinking at all, much less-- you sound just like Esteban's mom.
I need you in the clinic.
sorry, I'm busy.
tell me you have a case. You know, even if you don't.
I have a case.
sounds interesting. I'll take it.
I owe you one. Now tell me you don't have a case.
I really do have a case.
we're even.
you guys know how to honeymoon.
this is Dr. House.
aphasia and syncope.
he can't speak.
"aphasia" is Greek for loss of voice.
we've ruled out infection, vocal cord damage, and stroke.
a lot of guys syncope at the altar.
it's Greek for "having the vapors."
we ruled out all the common causes of fainting:
low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, dehydration don't say "ah."
do you know what it is?
roll on your side and lift up your gown.
there's one thing they didn't test for.
a test for what?
faking.
test was positive.
I - I can - - I can talk. I - I wasn't faking.
my voice just came back right now.
Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince.
I know he wasn't faking.
well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper.
what about the syncope?
well, the - - is she buying this too?
why would he fake anything?
it's Greek for "duh."
still, you get to keep the engagement ring.
I don't think he was faking.
that's because you're more gullible than I am.
for instance, I don't believe that you called off your open marriage.
I believe your wife called it off, and you called off telling her that you weren't calling it off.
a guy doesn't just throw a golden ticket in the trash.
the same way a guy doesn't give up a lucrative medical practice to come work for you?
that's exactly why you dabble.
you're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.
I'm not that predictable.
for example, you're probably not expecting me to ask you out for dinner tonight.
no, thanks.
you won't even consider it?
I did, just very quickly.
the truth is, since I called this thing off, my wife has been very grateful and I could do with a down night.
if I go out with the boss, nobody can blame me.
okay. If you bring your wife.
no. That's the point.
I need a little - - you're lying.
I'm not lying.
then I'm not going.
okay. Fontina at 8: 30.
you believe me, right?
of course I believe you.
then let's do it.
we'll tell a cab to take us to AC right now and get it done.
you're serious? You just walked out of the emergency room.
exactly. I walked out. I feel great.
well, we do have the clothes for it.
Ted, what's wrong?
are you - - what's wrong? Oh, my God.
can somebody help us?
please! Please hurry.
just breathe. Oh, my God.
there's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding.
a Tweet, for example.
pleural effusion.
you think his lung is faking it?
there's at least 200 ccs of fluid in there.
okay, let's say all his symptoms are real.
explain how one of them suddenly went away without using the words "virgin" or "Mary."
if the pleural effusion's caused by something systemic, it could explain his other two symptoms.
and so whether you believe him or not, all we have to figure out is what caused the pe.
er ruled out infection. Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.
a medication he's not telling us about.
you really don't trust this guy, do you?
I don't even trust the ER.
let's rule out infections ourselves.
tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure.
we already - - this time, talk about nuptials while you do it.
check his home for everything else.
he just moved in with his fiancee three months ago.
toxic exposure could take longer than that to manifest.
you check his love nest.
you two check his swinging bachelor pad.
that somebody else now lives in?
I assume so.
not the glass. No!
the place looks like ...1960s?
could have lead paint.
you think a 27-year-old has pica?
if it gets us out of here before the owner comes back, yes.
What'd you tell that cute physio?
that I changed my mind.
no, you didn't.
you're more nervous than usual.
wha ... That's a suspended ceiling.
what are you doing?
I want to see what's above it.
more ceiling.
made of 40-year-old acoustic tile.
asbestosis. I like it. I'll be in the car.
what the hell?
uh, it's okay.
we're doctors. Nobody was home, so - - well, I'm calling the police.
do you know Ted Taylor? He used to live here.
Yeah. What about him?
he's our patient at Princeton Plainsboro.
is he okay? - We think he may have asbestosis from your ceiling tiles.
they're not asbestos. I had 'em checked when I moved in.
how sick is he?
is he a friend of yours? - He was.
actually, he was my boyfriend for three years.
I'm not gay. - Really?
cause it would certainly explain the cold feet.
Oh, and the boyfriend.
so you're bisexual?
no, I'm straight. Cotter, the guy you met, he's gay.
he had a crush on me. I left.
after three years? - Well, it's possible.
it doesn't mean you're gay just 'cause the guy you're sleeping with is.
we weren't sleeping together. What's this got to do with anything?
lung tap turned up mononucleosis.
er doesn't routinely test for it.
it explains the pe and can be virtually asymptomatic.
so we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono?
you're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised.
if there's been any unprotected sex, we'll need to test for HIV.
there's been no sex of any kind.
okay. I'll go test your fiancee for HIV.
is she the curious sort?
wait.
there may have been some contact, but I'm not gay.
sodomy, one of the top ten most common household accidents.
I did a lot of stupid things, but I turned my life around.
I'm as straight as any of you.
you don't have to believe me. I'm just saying you can test me ...
as long as you don't tell Nicole.
what business is it of hers?
I don't see anything wrong with him marrying a straight woman.
how about, it'll make them both miserable?
just like most straight marriages.
he's got the right to life, liberty, and unhappiness, like the rest of us.
absolutely no reason to look at me.
I'm not saying it's a great choice. Just saying it's his choice.
it has to be hers as well, which it can't be as long as she doesn't know he's gay.
which is how it's gonna stay since we have no right to tell her.
like you've never bent the rules.
you date guys.
you date girls. I assume at some point, you're gonna make a choice.
I don't lie about who I am.
patients lying never bothered you before.
patients weren't lying about their sexual orientation before.
so you're only judgmental when it gets personal.
does it bother me that people hurt others because they're too weak to face the truth?
Yeah. Sorry about that.
tell me she's not looking at me.
he's negative? - Yep.
looks like being gay didn't make him sick.
so maybe being straight did.
the test was negative. No HIV.
I told you.
what you didn't tell us is how you turned your life around.
it can be pretty hard. It was.
downright impossible on your own.
I talked to some people.
it was more than just talk, wasn't it?
I know this is personal stuff.
I'm here to help you, not out you.
I had therapy.
conversion therapy.
went to a camp for three weeks of intensive rehabilitation.
they injected him with emetics while he watched gay porn.
Apomorphine?
or lithium chloride or cyclophosphamide. He doesn't know.
and when that didn't work, they shot him up with male hormones.
a chemical assault like that could explain the pe.
and the ECT explains the rest.
they gave him electroconvulsive therapy to make him straight?
to zap the fabulous right out of him.
neural damage accounts for the aphasia. - ECT doesn't cause neural damage.
unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-man quackery camp.
run an EEG.
see if they straightened him or just scrambled him.
sorry. I completely forgot.
my wife just started a ceramics class Tuesdays at 8: 00.
it's a half-hour drive from here. She won't be back till 10: 30.
she's taking it with her girlfriend Marly.
she hopes to make a tea service.
you want to call her?
no need. I already texted her.
and here she is now.
I think you're still seeing the physio.
you've got a backup suit in your car.
don't want to be bringing home da stank.
okay, yes, you're right, about everything. But please, House. Don't tell her.
Hi, Rachel. - Hi, Dr. House.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Hi, honey. Got your text, obviously.
I'm just leaving. I've got a ceramics class.
Really? - I love it.
even managed to talk Chris into signing up for one.
of course, he's in the beginners' class.
you're in a ceramics class?
friday nights, right?
friday nights. Sounded like fun.
you should join Chris'.
you know, I should.
well, gotta go.
making a tea service.
Hi, I must have fallen asleep in the lounge.
what are they doing? - An EEG.
what's it for?
we're looking for neurological damage that could have caused his symptoms.
damage from what?
a head trauma.
he had an accident?
it wasn't an accident. It was before he met you.
well, what happened? Was he hospitalized?
you should ask him about it.
they have the results.
everything looks normal.
look at this.
beta waves are spiking.
what's that mean?
I'm not sure.
he's coding. Crash cart.
what's happening to him?
he's having a heart attack.
charging. Clear.
EKG showed no abnormalities.
so what caused the arrest?
four ways to stop a heart.
electrical problems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds.
I think that's three things.
and cheating.
Oh, no. Sorry.
that's how you break a heart.
I found a ceramics class in Trenton on Friday nights that was full, so my wife couldn't join me.
EP study ruled out shocks.
now you just have to find some pottery by Taub.
the lamer it looks, the better.
so we'll do an angio to see if it's blocks or bleeds.
you should be a doctor.
I'm gonna check out this new lesbian bar tonight.
your life is awesome.
you want to come?
I was telling a 33-year-old woman that she has breast cancer.
no, you weren't. - How do you know?
because if you were, you'd need to see the pain in her eye,s so she could see the concern in yours.
why are you setting me up on dates with my team?
Taub asking me out was quirky, but Thirteen doing it is a barking cat.
I'm doing it to help you.
by setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with?
and Thirteen?
I've been spending more time with Sam.
I know it's been hard on you.
I figured if you had some company - - I don't need your help.
then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.
I gave him a dollar.
how much did you have to pay? - Nothing.
I just told them you might be feeling down and it was in their self-interest to keep you company.
100 bucks. Foreman held out for 200.
house, I'm worried about you. You could have ended up in jail or worse.
racking you with guilt.
so I do something really stupid and you reward me.
read any parenting manual. That's not helping me. That's helping you.
fine, I did it for me, for my relationship, out of pure self-interest.
okay. - You'll do it?
for you.
thank you.
it's not gonna work, though.
maybe.
but how bad can a night out at a lesbian bar be.
how are you doing?
heart attack at 27.
um, they said you had a head trauma.
I fell off a stepladder and--and hit my head. It was a stupid accident.
an accident.
we need to prep you for your angio.
valium will help you relax.
we're gonna run a line through your femoral artery.
Ted? - He's having another heart attack?
I don't think so. His heart rate seems normal.
are you okay?
you weren't discussing wedding plans, were you?
no. I guess I just ...
fainted.
P.O.T.S. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
bp plummets when he's upright, reverts to normal when he's lying down.
he was lying down both times we took his blood pressure.
protracted hypotension could have induced his heart attack.
also explains the syncope.
and his aphasia. He was upright, then you laid him down on the bed to test him.
bp reverted to normal. Voice came back.
jabbing him with the needle had nothing to do with it.
P.O.T.S. can be brought on by a viral or bacterial infection such as mono.
so load him up with fludrocortisone.
you didn't read your ceramics course description, did you?
Yeah. You did?
as I'm sure your wife did.
so we all know they're doing a fourth of July theme.
she'll be expecting something star-spangled.
yes?
cotter Macklin. I'm an old friend of Ted's.
how's he doing?
um, he had a heart attack.
Oh, my God.
they have him on some new meds.
really knocked him out.
well, how are you holding up?
I'm okay. Thanks.
um, I brought this for him.
that's his favorite thing in the whole world.
I know.
you weren't at the wedding, were you?
no, I - I wasn't invited.
Ted and I had a-a falling out.
how did you know each other?
um, we met senior year of college.
Yeah, we - - we shared a house for a while.
you were roommates?
for three years.
I'm - - I'm sorry. I - I just miss him.
I think you should leave.
I shouldn't have done that. - Now.
please.
I hope he gets better.
Hey, how are you feeling?
don't know yet. - Your numbers look good.
we're gonna keep you on these meds.
you had a visitor while you were asleep.
Oh, yeah?
cotter. Who is he?
I shared a house with him after college. I don't know why he would show up.
that's it?
Yeah. Why? What did he say?
I need to hear it from you, Ted.
one night, I got really drunk and I went to bed.
and he came into my room.
one thing led to another.
the whole thing was a mistake.
are you saying you had sex with him?
I was drunk and confused.
you're gay?
no. I thought I was.
I even made up my mind to tell my family.
I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, psyching myself up.
all I could see was disgust.
and that's when I realized, I didn't hate the thought of admitting I was gay because I was ashamed.
I hated the thought because I wasn't gay.
and that was the day I went to get help.
so you're not gay?
they cured me, Nicole.
that's what all the head trauma is about.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it's - - it's all in the past now.
it doesn't matter anymore.
what is it?
Oh, my head!
he's got severe headaches.
so do I.
should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?
no. What about infection?
that's what we're thinking.
cerebral infection would explain the headaches, could have caused P.O.T.S.
if it's fungal, it could have spread to the heart.
I was talking about you.
has the little gent been wearing a tent?
remind me why that has anything to do with you.
a distracted person makes a distracted professional.
and destroying my marriage will help me focus.
probably.
do a spinal tap. Run the CSF.
still talking about you.
but you can do it on the patient, too, if you want.
what about her? - The bartender?
she's the only one who's not here for fun.
trust me, she's not straight.
if your gaydar is so great, how come you didn't know about the patient till you met his boyfriend?
the guy walked in with his bride.
it took me a while to rotate my dish.
it's unbelievable what he's doing to her.
you don't think he loves her?
he may love her, but he needs to have sex with other men.
Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women.
Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to her too, but it's hardly the same.
to be faithful to his wife, our patient has to deny his identity.
Taub just needs to - - to resist a biological imperative?
it is easier to say no to dessert than to pretend you don't eat.
says someone who's obviously never been on a diet.
Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.
you're successful, smart, and you attract everything that moves.
if you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice.
you know what? I agree with you.
my self-pity's optional. What about yours?
yeah?
CSF was negative for infection, and his headaches are worse.
we were just talking about you.
please don't.
it's not P.O.T.S., so we're back to square one.
not quite.
you did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse.
we're maxing him out on morphine.
he sprung a leak.
he's losing CSF from the tap site.
we made his headaches worse?
just you, actually.
that still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.
the low pressure in his brain caused the P.O.T.S. not the other way around.
patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF.
there. That should stop the leak.
you should be feeling some relief soon.
I spoke to my parents.
how are they doing?
they're still worried.
well, tell them not to be.
everything's gonna be okay.
what's happening? - He's stroking.
both eyes are responsive.
tell me your full name.
theodore Philip Taylor. - This isn't a stroke.
then what is it?
what's happening to me?
it's really not P.O.T.S. We're really back to square one.
so what's masquerading as a stroke?
voted the worst Halloween costume, by the way.
MRA showed no problems with blood flow to the brain. Rules out T. I.A.
chest x-rays showed no hilar masses.
any luck with the pottery?
wasn't easy. Bought a suitably cruddy set of fife and drum napkin rings online.
Scleroderma? - Skin's fine.
A.N.A. was negative. So what did that set you back?
too much. I got into a bidding war with some lunatic.
histoplasmosis. - EIA was clear.
Hey, could have gone a lot higher than $215.
you're Kissmyasthma99?
what about Melas?
mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes.
no, idiot. Lactate levels are stable.
we're missing something.
we've run every test that makes sense, asked every question we can think of, gone over his history a dozen times.
we know how much we can trust his history.
if history is written by the Victor, how do we find out what really happened?
talk to the loser. - Call the boyfriend.
let's get them all in the same room.
or we could question them separately and not torture them.
or we could get them all in the same room and get the truth.
drinks are on me and Foreman tonight.
can't. Pap smear.
we don't want to do it either, but Wilson already paid us.
it's gonna suck.
I know.
where and when?
any incidents of dizziness?
seizures?
blackouts?
other than our wedding day.
don't you think I would have told you if there were?
my sister's birthday.
I was drunk.
you had one Martini.
on an empty stomach.
look, he was just sitting on the couch, and then he - - he - - he fell over and that was it.
well, once I slept it off, I was fine.
well, I stayed up that night, checking on him every 15 minutes.
what about sex?
Yes, I have sex with my girlfriend, because I'm not gay.
we have sex. - Thank you.
no problems?
um, well, there have been some ... - Nic.
issues.
erectile dysfunction? - Every guy has it sometimes.
we never had that problem.
gee, that must be because Ted doesn't like girls.
or because it's vascular.
I know we did an MRA, but arterial disease causing acute ischemia could explain the heart, neuro symptoms, and maybe even P.O.T.S.
might I suggest a diagnostic test?
the penile plethysmograph measures changes in blood flow in your penis.
tells us if there's a circulatory problem.
you just need to be in the right ... state.
what's your pleasure?
I feel terrible. I-I don't think anything's gonna work.
then we'll have to give you a shot.
where you don't want to get one.
shot it is.
nobody wants to follow that.
the night just keeps getting better.
to Wilson.
everything looks fine.
you sure?
medically, that's good news.
are you feeling feverish? You're sweating.
no. I feel lousy, but I don't know why I'm sweating.
what is it?
you're not sweating.
you're lactating.
can't tell his fiancee he's gay, how is he gonna tell her he's pregnant?
his therapists loaded him with hormones.
male hormones don't make you lactate.
except they could screw up your thyroid.
that was over three months ago. We just started milking him last night.
so something else screwed up his thyroid.
graves, hashimoto's.
Nope. TSH was normal.
pituitary tumor.
could also explain his libido and heart issues.
and if the tumor's big enough, his headaches and syncope.
except we - - we cleared him for cancer.
didn't say cancer.
Prolactinomas can be benign.
check his prolactin level, then MRI his pituitary.
sounds like you had fun last night.
you believe Chase?
I believe Foreman.
and they had fun with you.
what happened?
I realized that they could be my friends.
you're serious.
and then I sobered up.
you weren't that drunk.
you managed to find your way into your own little bed last night.
I think I sleep better in rocket ship sheets.
no, you want to blame this on the booze, but that's easy.
change is hard.
and wisdom is knowing the difference between what you can change ...
and what you were born with.
and cowardice is labeling what you don't want to change as innate.
I was winning this argument.
pituitary MRI - - was normal.
how are the headaches?
terrible.
give me your head. - What the hell?
I know. It's the first time you've heard that sentence with a possessive pronoun.
Oh, wow, that - - that's better.
okay, enough.
how cool is that?
you have a chiari malformation, a narrowing in the base of your skull that can cut off CSF flow.
but it wasn't a problem until the ECT at breeder boot camp caused your brain to swell just enough to plug the opening.
and when your brain pressed up against your pituitary, it signed you up for la leche league.
you still won't be pitching a tent for your lady, but that's just because, you know, she's a lady.
its orthostatic effect was mimicking P.O.T.S.
it also does an uncanny Christopher Walken.
unfortunately, if you treat it like P.O.T.S.,it gets worse.
so as far as that goes, oops.
proper treatment is surgery. We'll get you in right away.
so how did I get this thing?
overbearing mother.
kidding. CM's congenital.
like so many other things, you were born that way.
I thought you might be running low, so ...
Thanks.
I'm not coming back.
Ted, this is a mistake.
I know you're hurting, and I'm sorry.
I'm talking about hurting her.
I love her.
thank you for your support.
we both really appreciate it.
good luck.
you know what I've been thinking?
it's your birthday in three weeks.
what do you say we rebook the church and make it a doubleheader?
I don't know, Ted.
less than a week ago, we were standing at the altar, perfectly happy.
nothing's changed.
Really?
I still love you.
do you still love me?
Yes.
but - - then that's all that matters.
but I think that you still love him.
I'm not gay, Nicole.
I promise you.
how can you promise me that?
because I believe that we get to choose how we live our lives, and I've made my choice.
so now I have to make mine.
I'm sorry.
no. No.
I'm not saying good-bye.
Yeah.
I want to marry you. I have to marry you.
it's Friday night.
I called it off.
for real this time.
frees you up for the next one.
one day at a time.
napkin rings.
my way of saying thanks.
for trying to wreck your marriage?
for trying to save it.
and I get napkin rings?
expensive ones.
I hired a replacement.
for my P.A.
she seems great.
good work. - You too.
your patient's going home tomorrow.
he doesn't have a home.
you want to grab a bite to eat?
so Wilson got to you too?
no. This is just me.
Lucas? - Working late.
I'm buying.
I'm not that hungry.
okay.
I just want us to be friends.
funny.
that's the last thing I want us to be.
okay.
"Therafy" me.
you're late.
you're fat.
it's unusual.
you know how far the parking lot is?
my leg's been hurting.
anything been on your mind lately, any particular stress?
no. Probably just gonna rain.
you like the new Monet reproduction in the waiting room-- the Water Lilies?
I was late.
I wasn't focusing on the decor, but it sounds appropriately bland and calming.
stress can also make you absentminded.
I'm not stressed... Beyond the stress induced by you telling me how stressed I am.
just an ordinary week.
okay.
tell me about it.
I had a patient.
good. I have a case for you.
beer?
amnesia.
she was found jogging in the street, disoriented. She almost got hit by a truck.
the MRI showed no abnormalities.
no I. D. on her.
just her jogging clothes and her heart rate monitor.
we know absolutely nothing about her.
we know she has money.
blaze outriggers-- 400 bucks a pair.
people who have money don't just disappear.
sooner or later, someone's gonna show up looking for her.
can I have something to eat? - She just ate 15 minutes ago.
she keeps forgetting.
you don't eat because you remember it's time to eat.
you eat 'cause you're hungry. Her metabolism is in high gear.
she is an extreme long-distance runner-- Why were you in the ER?
that's your question?
you're a psychotherapist. You're hearing about a great amnesia case, and all you're asking me is geography.
just curious.
I was avoiding Wilson.
I knew there were some things that he'd want to process with me... At length.
Sam's moving in.
if it's before Friday, your assistant wins the pool.
I was just wondering what your plans were.
tonight? - In life.
Sam likes you... - But she wants me to move out.
no. I want you to move out.
I didn't know things with Sam would happen so quickly.
I didn't - I don't want to make a mistake here.
I've made a lot of mistakes. - By moving too quickly.
given your usual rate of commitment, I'm surprised you're not already re-divorced.
I could help you find a place.
what's wrong with my old place?
nothing. I just thought... You might want to find somewhere new, somewhere...
where I didn't abuse drugs and hallucinate.
Yes.
I'm fine.
you're fine?
your best friend is tossing you out, and you're fine?
you're not feeling a little... betrayed and angry?
Wilson bought a two-bedroom condo specifically so that you could move in with him.
it wasn't that long ago.
you don't feel a little... jerked around?
he couldn't foresee Sam coming back into his life.
that's a very rational defense of your friend.
based on the fact that you were late, and you didn't notice the pictures in the outer office.
those aren't symptoms. - They are to me.
and here's another one. You took the case. Hmm?
no negotiating, no bargaining.
no clinic hours changed hands.
were you looking for something to distract you from the fact that your best friend just threw you out?
case was interesting. - It's not organic. It's not mysterious.
most likely some psychologically traumatic event occurred that made the patient's brain choose to forget everything.
or not.
here.
loss of differentiation between gray and white matter.
that's subtle.
but it's in the area that controls memory. Not likely it's a coincidence.
bacterial infection?
do I need to know this?
fine. I'll give you the cliff notes version - Chase - M. S.
Taub--physical trauma. I can tell you why we ruled them out.
or not.
it's probably a toxin, and we need to find it before it kills her. We should search her House.
good luck with that.
her heart rate monitor has a serial number.
the distributor can match the number to the store that sold it.
she's a serious athlete. She might have been there often enough to be remembered.
brilliant.
did he really say that?
Subtextually. - Long shot.
even if the store clerk doesn't know who she is, the store's probably close to where she lives.
just seeing those surroundings might spark a memory.
you want us to take her there?
no. I'll take her.
Really?
uh, it's unusual for you to spend time with a patient, isn't it?
patients are boring... As people.
this one I'm sure was no exception, but her situation was interesting.
besides, I was still avoiding Wilson.
and no better way to avoid than leaving the hospital.
maybe.
or were you avoiding going home?
there's a reason they tell addicts to stay away from old geography.
I wasn't avoiding going home. I'd already gone home... Before I came into work that day.
I went straight there from Wilson's.
God, why don't people knock? House, it's you! Where you been?
hold up a second.
Juan Alvarez- you let him stay at your place?
not exactly.
I was beginning to wonder if you were ever gonna show up.
su casa, mi casa. Casa!
why are you here?
when I left Mayfield, I went back to the old neighborhood.
you know, you shouldn't leave the bathroom window unlocked.
Yeah, thanks for the safety lesson. Why are you here?
like I said, when I went back to the neighborhood, I found out immigration was looking for me.
so I decided to visit my old buddy House!
and turn his apartment into a giant prison jumpsuit.
Juan Alvarez is no freeloader. I do my part, earn my keep.
the first week I made your dinner, but you never showed up.
the second week i organized your stuff.
my stuff? - But still, you never showed up.
so this week, since I'm a real good painter, i decided to
coffee table- where'd you put it?
in the bedroom?
the paint's not cheap, House. It's a custom color.
it's a mix of titanium, yellow, and ochre.
Ochre- I don't even like that stuff. It's like a fruit. It's got hair on it.
but they say it's a vegetable- you sold my table to pay for paint that I don't want?
I had to sell some other things too.
get out. - No, papa, just give the color a chance.
look, I'm going to work now.
and when I come back, the walls will be a less exciting color, and you will be gone.
so Wilson threw you out, and you threw alvie out-- just, uh, another week?
unlike me, Alvie didn't leave. I took my motorcycle to work that day.
when I went home to get my car, he was painting the ceiling magenta.
so I brought him with me to protect the apartment.
Why?
to protect the apartment. Deja vu.
tossing him out or, uh, sending him to the movies or, uh, locking him in the bathroom would also minimize alvie's destructive force.
but you chose his company deliberately. Why?
obviously because he's a Wilson substitute.
you can barely tell the difference between them, especially when Wilson raps about the hood.
I'm not suggesting alvie's a substitute, but he would make a great distraction.
go on.
maybe the heart rate monitor was a gift.
that's why no one recognized her.
shut up, alvie.
anything familiar... Church, grocery store?
sorry.
it's okay, Ms. X. Maybe she's never been to this town before, bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.
you know that puerto ricans are U. S. citizens, right?
instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?
I had a birth certificate. I lost it.
so get a new one. - I tried that, House.
but the town hall had burned down when I was a kid, destroyed the records.
there's only one copy?
they tried to make me fill out a whole bunch of forms before they'd give it to me.
I decided it would be quicker and easier to do it myself.
how'd that go?
they figured out it was forged. And now, for some reason, they don't believe anything I say.
they actually think I'm lying about being puerto rican.
told me I had to go to a special hearing to prove it.
what if nothing ever looks familiar?
then someone will show up- a spouse, a friend- to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling.
they always do.
I don't know who that is... But I miss him.
what did they say at the hearing?
I didn't go. I lied once.
your mother is puerto rican, therefore, you are puerto rican.
all you got to do is prove your mom's your mom, find some documentation
people like that don't listen to people like me.
doughnuts! Hey, House, let's get doughnuts!
Alvie, the hearing- everyone loves doughnuts
glazed, crullers, elephant ears, even doughnut holes.
much better than the sporting goods store. I went Mrs. x went there all the time.
we're not here- And then I realized... You make a good point.
Really? I was making that up.
dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled?
you want the usual, right?
your old friend, the fried carbohydrate.
she needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit. Do you know her name?
Sandy... Or Shelley.
I don't know. The guy she's with called her that once. I just work here.
do you know where they live?
he left a business card in our free doughnut jar.
it's up on the wall of winners.
God, I was so worried about you.
what happened?
the police said it was too soon to do anything, so I started calling hospitals on my own.
princeton Plainsboro wasn't even on my list.
you really think something around here could have made her sick?
here, work, anywhere she could have been exposed.
why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?
well, I mean, it's a long way to run, even for her.
what is it I do besides run?
you're a lawyer- civil rights, class action suits.
it's a stressful job.
running's the way you deal with it.
that doesn't sound like me.
do you have any idea what would sound like you?
good point.
so what were you thinking during all this?
that it was a strange position to be in.
at that moment, she was more comfortable with me than with her husband.
and he was picking up on it.
what about you?
what about me how?
well, there was a sort of, um, artificial intimacy between you?
she'd been dependent on you. Uh, did you find that attractive on some level?
disturbing?
those are my two choices?
none of the above.
she was just a patient. She was interesting.
so we're really... Married?
for four years.
ms. X, you lead a lemon fresh life.
found three different cleansers under the sink.
cleaned out the medicine cabinets too.
you know, she just won a settlement for some families whose housing development was built on an old methane field.
toxic exposure to methane could explain this.
I surf?
you stopped before we met.
you've been too busy.
and we're married?
Yes.
all right, it's nothing personal.
bet she didn't think you were her type back when you first met either.
we'll take her back to the hospital, test her blood and urine and start treatment.
I'm all right.
what happened? - I don't know.
my foot suddenly went numb.
her pants are wet.
urinary incontinence.
she's having complex partial seizures.
this isn't methane.
you can leave the bucket. We need to get her to- Seizures?
this is the second diagnosis you've come up with that has a personal resonance for you.
I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues?
you think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?
you're choosing to tell me about this case, so let's look at it.
first you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past, - possibly because you're worried about a harmful toxin from your own past. - Chase had the toxin idea.
maybe he's obsessed with my past. - And now you're talking about a seizure disorder?
which is also not a toxin.
but which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain.
w-why do you see your past as such a threat?
not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.
there's a ding mark.
it's a piece of junk. It was dinged when it came in.
sure, the-the cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three chips.
this fourth one is new.
I run a pawn shop, not a storage company. Do you want it or not?
that should be it.
you said you pawned five books. There's only four.
that's all there is.
Where's approach to the acute abdomen?
sold it.
to? - I can't tell you.
crazy bastards like you try to hunt down their stuff.
how much for the pile?
500
you said it was junk. - No, no.
it's your junk. You want it.$500-- take it or leave it.
why is it so important that you get your stuff back?
unlike the rest of humanity... Who's okay when their belongings are taken.
everyone wants their stuff. That's why it's their stuff.
everyone doesn't pay five times what it's worth.
I like my stuff.
I hate it when Wilson moves it- This is not about Wilson!
say it.
I wasn't gonna say anything.
31, 31! Hike!
first down!
one more, you get a touchdown.
house, you can't run for the touchdown.
wait, wait, wait. Wait.
you seriously thought you were gonna tell me that Wilson showed up but not tell me what he said?
because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him.
Wilson noticed that I didn't come to my office all day.
he came to find me, wanted to make sure I'm okay- boring, boring, boring.
um, but you thought it was important to tell me about nerf football?
sorry. Your story. Continue.
house, House, stop! Stop, stop, stop.
you okay?
Yeah. It was my mother's. She died when I was four.
it's all I have left.
that's very sad, alvie.
listen, I set up an immigration hearing.
no, House, I'm gonna end up in jail or worse- the Dominican or someplace.
um, interesting.
you present yourself as, uh, not giving a damn about other people's emotions, but your actions indicate otherwise.
you dismiss alvie's story about his mother, but you cared enough to schedule a hearing.
I cared for eight seconds.
then I got distracted.
Yeah. - We've kept the patient up for 12 hours now.
no hint of seizure-like activity. We should shut this down.
try a strobe light, add more stress.
I think there's plenty of stress in here. - Don't we ever do anything but work?
you run. - That's just more work.
what about fun?
God, how can we be this boring?
apparently, without her memory, the patient's personality has returned to what you might call its natural state.
seems she had a wake-up call while she was at college.
her brother died in a car accident. She decided to make her life mean something.
went to law school.
now that's all gone.
the thing that caused the change is gone... So the change itself is gone.
Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you.
bet you got a theory already. What is it?
it's not relevant.
what is it?
why do you care about my theory?
I think he just... Bores her.
she's at an earlier stage of development. She's looking at her grown-up future, and it puts her to sleep.
if he just bored her, she'd hide it to be polite.
their problem is synchronicity. Just like you and me, House, they're not on the same page.
he talks to her like someone he shares history with.
but from her point of view, he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her.
of course she doesn't like him. He's not helping.
he can feel he's losing his wife, and it makes him come on stronger.
he almost did lose his wife.
the breathing problem was caused by fluid overload in the lungs.
diabetes insipidus.
and the D. I. Came from damage to the hypothalamus.
hypothalamus here, hence the D. I. and incontinence. They mingle here.
there's the global amnesia. And the motor cortex-- that's the foot paralysis.
what do they all have in common?
okay, now you're just doing this to mess with me.
what possible relevance does this differential have to your problems?
it ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis.
I convinced the team to cut out part of this woman's brain.
that's not interesting to you? - No.
not even if it's the amygdala?
she'll lose all her long-term memory.
well, this is where you tell me that being cavalier with someone else's past has nothing to do with avoiding your own past.
the case is irrelevant.
you just found it, uh... Interesting.
aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?
nowhere... Is that in the manual.
look, you--you've been in therapy for a year.
you know when I ask you to talk about anything, I mean anything that affects you
what upset you, what made you mad or relieved or joyful.
you want me to believe that this case means nothing?
then, um...
why should I listen to it?
are you charging me for this time?
Yes.
this is ridiculous.
what's that?
on the back of your arm?
it's just a bruise. And I fell.
you remember falling?
no.
I was drunk... Hence the balance issues.
well, it looks like you fell on the tip of someone's boot.
I said something that someone objected to.
well, if you don't remember, then how can you-- it's usually the way it is when someone hits me.
people who kick when you're down are jerks, but they're generally not irrational jerks.
Yogot drunk enough to get into a bar fight and not remember, and you've been insisting that everything's fine?
W-why-why go out and get blind drunk?
were you looking for a fight?
I don't know.
what have you screwed up?
what? - You say that when you've been hit in the past, it's because you provoked it with something that you said, which means you're well aware of the risks.
so on some level, you were in that bar looking for someone to hurt you.
logically, people punish themselves for something they did or something they didn't do.
so what... Did you screw up?
I don't know.
okay, there may be a problem.
all right... Let's talk about Wilson.
I told him your book was contaminated with Anthrax spores.
then I gave him $300.
the address of the buyer.
maybe I was hasty in asking you to move out.
why don't you stay with me and Sam for a little while?
there's no need to hurry things.
what prompted this?
look, the whole idea was that after Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own.
I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you're staying with me than
God's sake, Wilson.
you really span the chasm from wishy to washy.
why were you being so hard on the guy, when he was being conciliatory?
come on.
Cuddy played on his guilt. She put him up to this.
how do you know that?
how do you know this wasn't entirely his own idea?
two reasons- first, he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam.
he's been thinking about asking me to leave for a while.
finally he does it and immediately turns around and changes his mind--no.
he talked to somebody.
maybe it was Sam.
Yeah, that's a possibility.
I want this to be the last serious relationship I ever have.
I want this to be the one.
me too.
Where's House?
it's not as meaningful without him.
okay, um... Not Sam.
uh, that still doesn't answer why Cuddy.
because they've been talking about me.
she called me to check on the patient, which she never does without a reason.
I asked why, and she said... - She's a barracuda attorney, House.
these are the kind of patients we like to keep happy.
right now the patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.
Yeah, but when she gets that memory back, which we are trying to make happen, she'll be able to spell lawsuit.
I'm just touching base.
touching base.
Wilson used exactly the same phrase.
colluding about me is her favorite pastime.
okay, you think they talked.
how do you think that conversation went?
I'm worried about House.
me too.
couldn't you have waited?
it's way too early for him to be on his own, back in the old apartment.
what makes you think he can handle it? - I offered to find him a new place.
you have to let him back into your condo.
Sam and I just got him out of the condo.
you know what House is like. He's self-destructive.
without constant supervision, he's gonna slide back into drugs.
if you're not watching him, I've got to.
Yeah.
so they don't trust you.
they assume you'll fail.
are these their fears or yours?
let's turn on the lights, Hmm?
maybe they did talk about you, but... how do you know it didn't happen like this?
I'm worried about House. - Why?
it's the first time he'll be on his own since Mayfield.
now you're being overprotective. House doesn't need to be wrapped in cotton wool.
but you know that, or you wouldn't have asked him to move out.
okay.
I guess this is really about me.
it's just... I feel like a jerk.
sure, Sam and I are gonna want to be on our own eventually, but I kind of sprang this on him.
the right way would have been to just tell him to take as long as he needed, that there's no hurry.
so it's not what you did, but how you did it.
that matters in a friendship.
I need to fix this.
why don't you talk to him about moving back in?
just touch base.
we're having a consent issue with the patient.
wait a minute. Taub's not here.
Yeah, he is. - We're having a consent issue with the patient.
what's Taub doing in my imaginary version of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?
your version needed to be ended,'cause it's crap.
it's all sweetness and light and... Faith that I'm gonna choose the right path.
Yeah, that sounds like Wilson.
I have as much evidence for mine as you do for yours.
I know Wilson's your friend.
so he could be wondering if he did right by you.
and I know he wouldn't have asked you to move out in the first place unless he was convinced you could handle life on your own.
and I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House problem.
so there's truth in both versions.
but you choose to focus on the parts that make you uncomfortable.
so...
why are you and Wilson... Friends?
do you think this friendship is the best you can do?
Wilson is not a consolation prize.
there... You're defending him.
and a minute ago, he was skulking around in the background like some sort of manipulative iago.
he's my friend.
so what do you value in him?
I can say whatever I want to him, and he'll never leave.
he's sort of leaving.
at least, he won't be around as much... Because he's putting Sam first.
for now.
after the divorce, he'll probably ask me to move in again.
I take the long view.
you say that to Wilson?
are you kidding? That's the kind of remark that leads people to hate you.
uh, maybe you've been right from the beginning.
maybe this isn't about Wilson.
you say that now that I finally agree with you?
do you just argue the opposite of whatever I say?
I don't mean the Wilson thing doesn't, uh, bother you, uh, but it sounds like he's the closest you can come to a safe relationship.
you'd have to do something major to screw it up.
um, what--what else have you been involved in this week?
what would you want to punish yourself for?
I told you, I don't know.
okay, um, let's approach it from a different angle.
have you gotten any other people angry at you over anything?
well, yeah. That's why I called it an ordinary week.
okay. Tell me about it.
you'd be losing a part of your brain.
it is my brain. Why is it not my right to consent?
I'm sorry, but... I'll take this to court if necessary.
all right, Sidney's in no position to make decisions about herself right now.
she doesn't even know who she is.
I read your consent form, and I understood it. I want the surgery.
why wouldn't she?
of course she's willing to risk losing her memories permanently.
she has no idea how important those memories are.
does she even know what risk is?
she's never lost anything.
without the surgery, she'll lose everything.
the prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain.
well, there has to be another way.
please.
I'm speaking for my wife, the wife I lived with for four years who isn't here and can't defend herself.
Dr. House, are you listening?
well, you can stop arguing,'cause it doesn't matter anymore.
look at the variability in the heart rate.
the S. E. has spread into the brain stem.
W-wherever it is, you-you can still cut it out.
no. We can't cut the brain stem.
this thing's moving too quickly. Surgery's no longer an option, which I guess means you've won.
Congratulations.
put in a pacer and start her on chemo and radiation.
it won't cure her, but it'll buy a couple weeks so she can find out who she is before she dies.
that was pretty rough.
do you always break the news to your patients that way?
or were you short-handing it for me?
husband was being an idiot.
well, he was asking for it.
but, um, to punish him you have to punish the wife too.
Why--why did he make you so angry, Hmm?
because he didn't want to cooperate with you?
he'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage.
people's brains stop working when they think they're gonna lose someone they love.
your leg hurt?
it's all right.
okay. Anyone else you pissed off?
50 bucks for the book.
forget it.
you paid $25. That's 100% return.
that's what I paid. But it's a rare surgical text, nearly 100 years old- plate's in mint condition.
that book's worth several thousand dollars.
$2, 000-I'll write you a check.
nice try. Face it- I had the wit to recognize something valuable when I saw it.
in the great darwinian race, I get my just reward.
you become roadkill.
yo, House, you want to stop by the library?
cause I got a book to return. Ta-ka-plow!
old Professor tried to hoard hog you can't stop alvie with no guard-ass dog anyone see you?
Yeah, prof saw me walking down the driveway. He said the roses need more fertilizer.
I didn't know there was a section of the brain just for hope.
it's very, very tiny.
we used fluoroscopy to guide pacemaker placement in the patient's heart.
hello. - Hello.
rapidly progressive dilated cardiomyopathy.
this isn't S. E. and whatever it is, it's not just in her brain.
it's attacking her whole body.
you work for House? I guess we're teammates.
isn't that cool?
hello.
Juan alvarez? - What the hell?
we're taking you into custody- deportation order.
I'm a citizen. You're disrespecting Puerto Rico.
if you're a citizen, why'd you miss your hearing?
you called them?
what's going on?
we're trying to stabilize her heart.
she's still tachy and hypotensive.
brain, heart, and rapidly progressing.
Endocarditis--slow-moving infection in her heart throws clots to her brain.
I'm not talking to you.
how could you turn me in?
her extreme exercise suppresses her immune system, allows the infection to smolder.
or allows an old infection to reactivate it-T. B.
start her on a multidrug regimen.
I don't like you, House. I hate you.
even I. V. Antibiotics will take time to work.
a general reminder-the use of cell phones is prohibited.
give her the first dose directly into the lungs in the O. R.
before the less gentle arrest for contempt.
put her in an isolation room with U. V. light.
and get yourselves tested. You've all been exposed.
docket number 4378.
you are?
I am Mr. alvarez's doctor.
your honor, DNA evidence proving the matriarchal lineage of Juan alvarez.
my mother's DNA was still on that cross?
it could be.
you faked it?
it wasn't just me. You lied to them too!
I'm better at it than you are.
I'm gonna repaint your whole apartment now, make the drapes match the carpet now!
lungs sound wet. O-2 sats are dropping.
may need to tube her. Grab some I. V. Furosemide.
wait, wait.
she's crashing. We need to get her on a vent.
there's something on her ankle.

it's a surfing phrase. Must be from her earlier life.
she tried to get it removed, but they only took off the top layers of skin.
the ink is still in the deeper layers.

she was fine until she started the long-distance running.
the ultra-marathoning modified her immune system, set off the allergic reaction.
we did a full thickness skin graft, and she'll be okay.
so you were right... In the end.
it was her past.
did she get her memory back?
not yet.
will she?
no way to know. - I think roses are my favorite.
but I guess I told you that at some point.
I don't remember.
he's treating her as though they just met.
he's courting her.
whose idea was that?
he was doing the opposite of everything he should. Suddenly he's changed.
Taub thought it might- that was your idea.
and you asked me what I thought was going on between them.
it's their relationship that's on your mind.
that's why you've been thinking about this case-- relationships.
lost one with Wilson, gained one with alvie.
not exactly.
you gonna tell me what the note said?
alvie was very grateful that I'd gotten him out of trouble.
it allowed him to go stay with his cousin in Phoenix without worrying about immigration looking for him there.
you didn't think he was gonna stay forever.
no. - What happened next?
nothing happened next.
that's all I got.
relationships.
Bergman.
what do you want me to say? - I don't know.
you're the one who said the thing
something about relationships made you go out and provoke a fight.
Wilson and Sam have a relationship.
you're not thrilled about it.
they're happy.
why should I screw that up?
everyone's happy.
everyone's moving in together- Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas.
even Alvie's-Cuddy and Lucas are moving in together?
you didn't mention that.
they talked about moving in together before.
it's not big news.
approach to the acute abdomen...
written by Ernest T. Cuddy, M.D. Any relation to your Cuddy?
her great-grandfather.
I've had it for years... Always meant to give it to her for a special occasion.
like her... Housewarming?
it's just a gift.
a woman you care about is taking one step further away from you and closer to someone else?
I-I think I can safely say yes, it's significant if you don't mention it.
you were willing to punish the husband of your patient because you identified with him.
he was also losing someone he loved.
I'm not gonna go out and get hammered because a woman I'm not even with is moving in with someone.
that'd be pathetic.
to hell with this.
when I first came to you, I told you that I wanted to be happy, and I followed your advice.
and instead, I'm just miserable.
how is this working for me?
it takes time.
for a year, I've done everything you've asked, and everybody else is happy.
I run on my treadmill. You just sit there and watch.
you're a faith healer.
you take advantage of people who want to believe.
but there's nothing in your bag of tricks.
whatever the answer is, you don't have it.
D'VONTRAY: Deep-fried shrimp. And lobster.
I never had lobster.
whatever, boil or grill?
which one's better?
uh...just get them both.
and I know I need a strawberry malt whisky.
and then there's those chocolate donuts that come in a box.
warden: We'll do our best to accommodate.
tomorrow you'll be moved to a holding cell.
that's where you'll get your last meal.
you also have a constitutional right to a spiritual advisor of your choice.
no, I don't need none of that.
one last thing to think about.
after I read the execution warrant, you'll be given an opportunity to make a statement.
you might wanna take some time and think about what you wanna say as your final words.
D'VONTRAY: Yo, Clarence? You hear that?
a spiritual advisor of my choice.
don't matter, you're going to hell anyway.
you think I'll get another stay?
you should.
supreme Court said it ain't right to kill retards.
guard: Cut the chatter!
exercise time.
be back in an hour.
guard: Enjoy.
huh? What?
why did you hit me so many times, Clarence?
you know why!
you could have stopped.
you stabbed me in the back, man.
look, I never...
you couldn't fight fair?
like you did?
I had a wife and three kids.
you were a sick bastard! Open the door! Open the door!
Hey!
What'd I ever do to you, man?
Carlos: You better stay in this place.
EMMITT: I was just minding my own business.
how could you did that to me?
I'm your brother.
I never meant to ...
you can't go in there.
who are you? And why are you wearing a tie?
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant.
can I tell her what it's regarding?
Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don't.
I'm her assistant, not her secretary.
I graduated from Rutgers.
eh, I didn't know they had a secretarial school.
well, I hope you took some classes in sexual harassment law.
does the word "ka-ching" mean anything to you?
I'm going in now.
Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.
what's with hiring a male secretary?
J-Date not working out?
he is cute, be careful.
she's not like you, she can't just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in 20 minutes.
I met Mark at a fundraiser that happened to be held at a...
you met me at a strip club.
you were the worst $2 I've ever spent.
we'll catch up later.
Stacy, it's House. I know you can handle it.
nothing to handle.
he obviously wants to talk to you alone.
CUDDY: If you have a problem working with Stacy, you should have said so.
what was I supposed to do?
ask her to leave? That's just rude.
death row guy. I want the case.
how do you even know about him?
you don't have access to the hospital's mainframe.
no, but "partypants" does.
you stole my password?
hardly counts as stealing, it's a pretty obvious choice.
well, I have already assigned Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.
Nolo? Well, I...
I don't wanna say anything bad about another doctor, especially a useless drunk.
you are addicted to pain pills.
Yeah, but I'm not useless. Tell Nolo I'm taking over.
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.
Oh, good. I'm sure he'll explore all the usual options for why a guy's heart starts beating so fast it pumps out air instead of blood.
wait a second. There are no usual options.
how badly do you want this?
I will give you two more clinic hours this week.
don't bend over for the soap.
just the heart, or the patient have any other complaints?
patient is not talking to anybody.
where are we going?
you are going to the clinic for two hours.
me? Why?
talk to Cuddy.
she's got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences Unit.
I don't know.
aren't there better ways to spend our time?
good question.
what makes a person deserving?
is a man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a man who kills his wife?
uh...yeah, actually, he is.
what about a child molester?
certainly not a good guy, but he didn't kill anybody.
maybe he can get antibiotics, but no MRIs.
what about you?
what medical care should you be denied for being a car thief?
tell you what. Three of you work on a list of...
what medical treatments a person loses based on the crime they committed.
I'll review it when I get back.
your patient shanked one inmate his first month here.
broke another one's neck.
nearly decapitated one of my guards...
relax. I got a great bedside manner.
too dangerous to house him in the infirmary.
you don't have to worry, we've taken every precaution.
I've had my men clear from the cell all pens, paper clips, and staplers.
any supplies that might be used as a weapon.
open her up!
warden: For your visit, we've got him cuffed and shackled.
and yet you're staying out there.
Uhp! You're gonna have to give me that.
wouldn't want anybody to get hurt.
Hi. - Hi. - I'm Dr. Cameron.
how you feeling?
eh. Little cough, no big deal.
okay, then what you doing here?
I just got a job at the university, they need a health clearance.
apparently, I'm a little anemic, so they made me get some more tests.
any family history of anemia?
not that I know of.
my mom died of cancer when I was a kid.
my dad's heart gave out a couple of years ago.
brothers and sisters?
I'm afraid it's a short family history. That's it.
I had a husband once, but...didn't stick.
my tests should be back, probably in that file.
probably.
is everything okay?
wilson: Did you redo the x-ray?
twice.
well, you don't need a consult.
you know the diagnosis.
all she has is a cough.
bluish tinge to the fingernails, Lips.
he's hypoxic.
what's that mean?
it means he's not getting enough oxygen.
you know how people say you can't live without love?
well, oxygen's even more important.
he's got fluid in his lungs.
breathing rate of 50.
he needs to be intubated, put on a respirator.
don't have a respirator.
better get one in about an hour, or you're gonna lose him.
I'll make out a requisition.
state's already sentenced this man to die.
I think the state was a tad more specific about how.
this is Dr. Gregory House.
I need an ambulance pick-up at Mercer State Prison.
wasted call, my men will stop them at the gate.
no way a death row inmate leaves my prison.
at least not through the front doors.
you work fast.
so do you.
was that a shock?
Yeah.
it was easy, once I convinced the clerk to take it to Judge Markham.
she's a sucker for Eighth Amendment arguments.
stop, I'm getting turned on.
Ruh-roh!
it was just a consult!
you expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy?
did you do something to your hair?
you said you cleared it with her.
come on, you've known me how long?
and you still can't tell when I'm joshing you?
take him back to prison. Now.
no, can't.
see, ironically,
I'm bound by this court order that your ace attorney got.
I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him.
is it just me, or is that weird?
anyway, we're walking.
somebody left this on my chair.
it's clever, cause it forces me to either deal with the file or never sit down again.
Cindy Kramer. I told her you'd see her.
well, you shouldn't have told her that.
she's got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer.
six months tops.
have you even looked at the x-ray?
no. Just guessing.
it's a new game. If I'm wrong, she wins a stuffed bear.
a spot on an x-ray doesn't necessarily mean that she's terminal.
I love children. So filled with hope.
it could be pneumonia. It could be sarcoidosis.
could be.
if she didn't already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung.
can we at least brainstorm for other ideas?
thank you.
I still think pneumonia and sarcoidosis.
but we should check for tuberculosis and definitely rule out congestive heart failure.
five stages of dying.
exactly.
personally, I think it's all just New Age crap, but from your tear-filled, puppy dog eyes,
I think I've made my point.
now go tell Cindy that she's dying.
tachycardia. Pulmonary edema. Likely suspects?
the death row guy?
that's who you're working on instead of Cindy?
God, I've got to learn not to beat around the bush.
by dying, I meant no matter what we do.
very, very soon ，she is going to be dead.
is that still too subtle?
I took an oath to Do No Harm.
Yeah, but it's not like they make you sign it or anything.
we cure your patient, he goes back to death row.
he goes back to death row, they kill him.
he stays here and we don't treat him, he dies.
and I still don't treat Cindy Lou Who.
can we get on with this?
Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie.
exactly. I'm black.
I sympathize with guys who grew up in the inner city, kept down by The Man.
makes sense to me.
it's a bunch of crap!
you can't blame society for the fact that you chose to become a killer.
the guy's probably a heroin addict.
that explains the tachycardia, which caused the pulmonary edema.
how does an inmate on death row get his hands on heroin?
are you serious?
house: Man knows prisons.
when we got a yachting question, we'll come to you.
okay, drugs it is.
test his hair, blood, urine, works.
thanks for getting my back.
I thought you seminary boys were against the death penalty.
I've left the seminary.
over their stance on capital punishment?
I'm against the death penalty in principle.
in practice, however, watching a murderer die causes me a lot less grief than annoying my boss.
we gotta check you out before you go in.
cameron: Department of Justice statistics show that it's a racially motivated form of punishment.
black defendants are 10 times more likely to get a death sentence than whites.
doesn't mean we need to get rid of the death penalty.
just means we need to kill more white people.
it's okay. You're in a hospital, we're taking care of you.
stay calm, you hear me?
push two milligrams Ativan!
water. Water.
what's the differential for being thirsty?
he was just a little dehydrated.
and out of his mind.
we upped his saline drip. He's fine now.
blood and urine tests came back clean, no sign of opiates in his system.
don't do that.
what? You have some House theory explaining heroin use despite a negative test?
Nope.
only I get to write on the board.
so it's not drugs.
what else can cause a heart to do wind sprints?
you got the blood work back, anything out of the ordinary?
his bicarb is low.
Yeah, but which column?
it could be the result of the tachycardia, or it could be the cause.
it's the cause.
why, because you want it to be?
let's see how well that works with your other patient.
we're just talking semantics here.
we should put him on a bicarb drip and send him back.
right. Buff his numbers, don't bother trying to figure out the underlying cause.
I thought you cared about patients.
foreman: Our job isn't to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap.
our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to death row.
our job is to diagnose him.
what?
mommy and Daddy are having a little fight, doesn't mean we've stopped loving you.
now, go outside and play.
get Daddy some smokes, and an arterial blood gas test.
wow,
that was impressive.
okay, what number am I thinking of?
are you trying to get me fired?
if you didn't want me working here, why didn't you just say so?
I just don't want you working right here, in my office.
but anywhere else in the building is fine.
it's a really big hospital.
I'm a lawyer, you're a jerk. There's gonna be some overlap.
God, I hope that was a euphemism.
Cuddy just reamed me.
I hope that one means what I think it means.
for trusting you!
she figured when she hired me she'd at least have someone you couldn't walk all over.
the number was six, by the way.
I need to know, can I trust you?
if I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's approval, my patient would be dead.
great.
now I know.
now we can work together.
I'll be drawing some blood from your femoral artery.
from my what?
runs through your groin.
you think you're gonna stick me in the jewels with that?
it's really closer to your thigh.
technically at this point, it seems like your jewels are more for display purposes anyway.
hold up, hold up. Gimme some painkillers or something.
a tough guy like you don't need them.
forget that, numb me up, man.
you got some gang ink?
let me see that.
it's a Native American symbol.
it means "the force of life.
that's what you tell all these white dudes so they let you play doctor.
Yup, got them all fooled.
for real, how a brother like you go from gang banging to wearing that white coat?
how's a brother like you go from loving a woman to punching her skull in?
bitch stepped out.
sorry about that.
guess I didn't use enough lidocaine.
blood gas came back with a pH of 7. 28, and decreased HCO3.
which means two things.
most importantly,
cameron was wrong about the bi-carb.
and less significantly, we have a new symptom.
anion gap acidosis.
who's chubby?
come on, pretend he loves puppies.
pretend he's a human being. What do you got?
I think we should reconsider drugs.
he already tested negative.
that's why I said reconsider.
back in juvie, I cut up oregano and sold it as pot.
is that how you put yourself through med school?
what if Clarence thought he was taking heroin, but it was something else?
what something else could lead to anion gap acidosis?
Mudpiles.
well, you don't have to ask, just wash your hands before you come back.
methanol, uremia, diabetes...
Oh, it's a mnemonic. That makes sense, too.
Paraldehyde, INH, Lactic acid...
rewind.
INH?
Yahtzee.
drugs for tuberculosis.
nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with TB.
clever entrepreneur like Foreman here chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin.
INH poisoning would explain all the symptoms.
who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence's secret stash?
fine, I'll do it.
great! Chase it is.
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable.
you got a prettier mouth.
better chance the inmates will open up to you.
John CLIFT: Perhaps I'll come out looking just as monstrous.
I mean, isn't that what I deserve?
Dr. VIVIAN: John, it wasn't your fault.
if your father hadn't slipped you those drugs, you would have never done...
the man's in a coma!
he didn't mind. I asked.
you're getting crumbs all over him.
why do you think they put TVs in coma patients' rooms, anyway?
some people think they can still hear.
well, so leave them a radio. His eyes are closed.
who thinks they can see?
do you know why people are nice to other people?
Oh, I know this one!
because people are good, decent and caring.
either that, or people are cowards.
if I'm mean to you, you'll be mean to me.
Mutually-assured destruction.
exactly. Are you gonna eat these chips?
are you gonna get to your point?
you need people to like you.
I don't care if people like me.
Yes, but you need people to like you, because you need people.
unless you think you can get the next court order yourself.
if Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her.
and, that's not even dealing with the greater agenda of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.
Dr. BRUCE: We were gonna be with each other forever!
look, I know you're friends with her, but there is a code.
bros before hoes, man.
crap.
what is it?
death row guy is dying.
bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30.
it's not gonna hold out much longer.
you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?
temporary fix?
right.
don't know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin.
they're just gonna have to take more.
Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours.
we don't even know what's wrong with him.
just get out of here.
this is Chase.
did you beat any confessions out of anybody?
I haven't spoken to any inmates.
does anybody do their jobs anymore?
I decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.
appreciate your candor.
did you even go to the prison, or are you just out playing polo?
I'm searching both of Clarence's cells.
I figured if he's on something, it's stashed somewhere.
unless he finished it.
Yeah, that'd be a shame.
he could have shoved it anywhere.
there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands, paper, file folders.
call it off.
come on back.
what's going on?
you're dying.
house: A man deserves a last drink.
you're okay.
Thanks. That means a lot.
all the tests have been inconclusive?
diagnostics is more of an art than a science.
should I be worried right now?
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country.
we're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.
house: I thought you convicts knew how to drink.
you're at least three shots behind.
now you're four shots behind.
you better get me the next one, or I'm gonna kill you.
I was just waiting for test results, I was...
little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
unbelievable.
Oof! That's the finest piece I've seen in 10 years.
I could've hit that.
and you didn't?
eh.
man, you're the one that should be locked up.
tell me something.
I've been trying to figure this out.
why does a guy who's on death row suddenly try to off himself?
I know you drank that copier fluid.
it's not as visually dramatic as slitting your wrists with a homemade shiv, but it will do the trick.
it just hit me all of a sudden.
it was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, everything.
I had to take control of something, right?
when to die.
I figured that was as good as anything.
and that thought just came to you, just like that?
man, I told you, Twenty-three hours a
Mmm.
look, here's the good news.
the copier fluid you drank contains about 90% methanol, which is very poisonous, and you took more than enough to kill yourself.
the bad news is, the alcohol you just drank contains so much ethanol that it's going to bind with that nasty formic acid rampaging through your body, hence you're just gonna pee it out.
harmlessly.
man, you are drunk.
Yes, I am. I also saved your life.
Shee-ya.
at least for now.
morning!
your head hurts?
no, you just have a very grating voice.
you always were a lightweight.
why are you talking to me?
can't it be enough that I wanna cause you pain?
the patient's okay now, you're gonna send him back?
Absolutely.
can I trust you?
you used to.
I still think the patient's sick. I'm keeping him here.
Yeah. Either you can do your job and keep the hospital informed, or you can help me make sure the hospital is not informed and buy me some time.
chase: Have you done a CT?
Yeah, I have.
contrast?
she's done everything ,she needs to do except tell her patient that she's dying.
I told you, only I get to play with the markers.
our prisoner has a new symptom.
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.
I'm not buying that Clarence was trying to take control of his life by suicide.
healthy people don't kill themselves.
healthy people don't kill other people.
guy just filed an appeal in a state...
what if it wasn't suicide?
what if it was an escape plan?
drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here.
excellent.
explains everything except the symptom that got him here.
his heart went nuts before he got stuck in that storage cell and chugged a toner martini.
I think there's something going on in his head.
check for intracranial lesions, brain infections, autoimmune diseases, do a CT, LP, full workup.
state's paying, so go nuts.
foreman: Where'd you get these scars?
I got shivved my first month in.
after I healed up, I got mines.
you guys still think I'm sick?
obviously.
why do you care?
why don't you just let me die?
I'm different than you.
right. You love me like your own mama.
that's why the nurse says you kicked her out when my heart nearly stopped.
take a deep breath.
any family history of mental illness?
I always heard my pop was crazy, I never met the man.
with my mom, it was the drugs.
any siblings?
I got a brother, pretty much raised him on my own.
inspirational story.
he doing time, too?
hey...
he's a good kid.
don't go judging what you don't know.
how's his health?
I haven't heard from him since I went inside.
spent 16 years with him, changed his damn diapers.
can you imagine your whole life being all about the worst thing you ever did?
you killed four people.
and somehow making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.
Oh, no.
now you've left your entire body in my chair.
what does that mean you want?
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.
I take it the CT with contrast came back?
they're not definitive.
biopsy would be.
biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.
and definitive.
but you don't want definitive, you want to hang onto your delusions as long as you can.
a lavage could prove it's not cancer.
but you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch.
the answer is no.
Why? Because it's me?
I'm over you! I've jumped on the bandwagon.
and I hate you, okay?
great. Let's treat her.
what is it?
you won't help Cindy, but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt!
are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, or that all that matters is your stupid puzzle?
fine. Treat them the same, that's all I'm asking.
one test.
wow, that is remarkable.
according to those patchouli oil-selling New Agers, it's supposed to be the terminal patient, but you're going through the five stages.
you just made a completely seamless transition from anger to bargaining.
cover two more of my clinic hours, and you can have your one procedure.
no lesions, no aneurysms.
ironically, the mind of a killer looks completely normal.
if someone asked you to describe me to them, what's the first thing you'd tell them?
insecure.
what are you asking?
like if you were setting me up on a blind date.
would you describe me to the girl as the black guy?
a neurologist?
car thief?
this guy's really getting to you, isn't he?
there's no sign of infection.
you're gonna have to do the biopsy.
CUDDY: Your death row guy's still here.
Yeah, sorry. I've just gotta get him stabilized.
probably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes.
Oh, yeah? Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.
figuring requires deductive reasoning.
I'm figuring that you did no figuring.
Stacy just ratted me out, right?
so much for attorney-client privilege.
I'm the client, you moron.
Stacy has a duty to this hospital.
right.
I'm sending him back to prison.
whoa, can't. Court order.
court order says he has to be declared healthy.
doesn't specify which doctor needs to make that declaration.
what is it, Clarence?
my gut!
would you describe it as a shooting pain?
a throbbing pain?
or maybe an imaginary pain because you don't want to go back to prison?
where does it hurt?
my gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed!
well, he'd know.
let me take a look.
Oh, so everybody lies except a convicted murderer?
I don't think he's faking this stuff.
what do you think, Doctor?
I didn't have any choice.
no, you had to tell Cuddy.
she's your boss, I get it.
Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too.
Yeah, pretty much on that same level.
gandhi didn't march to the sea because his buddies asked him to.
pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends.
you're not making friends right now.
I trusted you.
I know.
Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.
I had to do what I thought was right.
it's the only reason anybody does anything.
surgery went fine.
they removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel.
they're shackling him and taking him into recovery.
I wonder.
I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate?
fine, I'll bite.
what the hell are you talking about?
everything we do is dictated by motive.
why did he kill his girlfriend?
because he's a maniac!
is that the reason he gave?
she was cheating on him.
jealousy.
that gets him sent to prison.
where he kills inmate number one. Why?
guy attacked him first.
revenge.
who'd he kill after that?
prison guard.
who had a file full of abuse complaints.
probably been kicking Clarence's ass for months.
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.
call that one "retribution
then he kills inmate number two.
anybody know why?
Uh-uh. It's not in there.
CLARENCE: All of a sudden, I gotta have a reason?
it's an anomaly.
doctors love anomalies.
dark spot on an x-ray, bright spot on an MRI.
killing that second inmate was the homicidal equivalent of blood in the urine.
it doesn't fit.
I'm interested in things that don't fit.
tell me why you did it.
your other victims you were almost bragging about.
what was different about this guy?
it happened when I was in gen-pop.
I was in the library, just reading.
and I started feeling real nervous.
this guy was staring at me.
I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck.
made me feel crazy.
sweat was pouring down my face.
I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears.
I just raged out on the dude.
so what's the differential for raging out?
excess testosterone, steroids.
Adrenalin?
prep Clarence for surgery.
care to share with the class?
Oh, come on, do I have to spell it out for you?
pheochromocytoma.
actually, I'm not sure how you spell it.
but you said it yourself, adrenalin.
pheochromocytoma sits on top of the adrenal gland, randomly spits out oodles of the stuff.
it's perfect. It explains everything, the tachycardia, pulmonary edema, the vasoconstriction that caused the necrotic bowel.
even explains how he had the strength to rip the rail off his bed.
but pheo's extremely rare.
I love rare.
set up an MRI. Where's Cameron?
like I don't know.
Dr. Cameron, could I borrow you for a consult?
bittersweet thing about being head of the Oncology Department,
I get CCED on all the biopsy results.
Yeah, I know.
she's terminal.
Yeah. So I take it you were in there informing her?
well, I-I hadn't exactly gotten around to that, but I was just
doing what? Making friends?
Cindy's divorced.
she doesn't have any kids, no siblings, both her parents are gone.
it's not your job to be her friend!
do you understand?
and it's not worth it.
she feels better her final few days, and you're not the same, maybe for years.
you don't think it's worth it?
I know it's not worth it.
my husband was
I met him just after he was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
if I hadn't married him.
he was alone.
when a good person dies, there should be an impact on the world.
somebody should notice.
somebody should be upset.
what?
I don't even remember.
it's just a fancy way of saying small, adrenalin-secreting tumor.
Yeah, that clarified it for you.
all you need to know is, if I'm right, we can fix it.
just gotta find it first.
we need an MRI.
it's completely painless for most people.
but not for me?
I assume you got those tattoos in prison.
prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals.
the MRI is basically a giant magnet, suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.
stop squirming.
don't make us do this again.
big baby.
still don't see anything.
CLARENCE: Turn it off!
there's Waldo.
found it, Clarence.
turn it off!
turn this damn thing off!
keep him in there until you guys see it, too.
son of a bitch.
looks like they got the pheo out successfully.
so, what now?
Clarence goes back to death row.
just like that?
he's cured.
that tumor caused random shots of adrenalin, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.
my God, you're right!
let's call the surgeons, we gotta save that tumor.
put it on the witness stand.
we could testify at Clarence's appeal.
you smell that?
I think that is the stink of hypocrisy.
you wouldn't even consider the notion that Clarence's social upbringing was responsible for what he became, but now you're sprinting to the witness stand to blame everything on a little tumor.
a person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.
Yeah. Because you only overcame one of them.
well, let's just give Clarence a free pass, hmmm?
which is probably gonna piss off all those other pheo sufferers who managed to control their rage attacks and become lawyers, race car drivers, or even doctors.
removing that tumor puts a stop to those random shots of adrenalin.
it doesn't absolve him.
you want him to be executed?
that's not what I'm saying.
got an opinion?
everyone's got an opinion.
I, uh, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.
you'll do what you think is right.
on your own time.
but it's just a cough.
for one night only, seven House of Lies cast members, leave their characters behind to perform long form improv.
it'll be... so, you guys will line up in the following order...
Josh Lawson, Kristen Bell, Don Cheadle. And it'll be like this.
should I snap on the way out? If you could not snap on the way out.
no suits. No scripts. No rules.
he doesn't understand not snapping. Should I not snap on the way out?
no, nobody should be snapping on the way out.
do the names and the order again, so we know how we're coming out.
sure, it'll be Ryan Gaul... Nope, nope, nope.
nobody's gonna be snapping.

Oh, no! - You're a monster!
I'm sorry! - We're gathered here today to mourn the loss of Kristen johannsen flannel.
and, um, we have a very special treat.
Ryan Gaul is gonna do the eulogy.
so, Ryan, if you would just like to say a couple words...
Thanks, Don.
woody... No!
no, I... - Oh, my God!
keep going.
here. - Thank you.
not the bathroom chair.
trusty bathroom chair.
she loved chairs. - - Unh!
No! - Oh, whoa!
um... - This isn't safe.
I shouldn't be doing this. - No, I really want to know what you're gonna say.
okay. - Are you insane?
chairs were a huge...
No! It went out of order!
that's our show!
don Cheadle, Eugene Cordero, Ryan Gaul!
you guys have fun?
thank you so much for coming out.
this is House of Lies Live.
guys, thank you so much. Be good.
good work, everybody. - Nice.
no, no! - Go another hour!
I pulled the goalie. Wait, you stopped using birth control?
I did! Jeannie, Sarah wants to have a baby.
Hey! That's my fucking car, man!
getting the old band back together for a reunion tour?
so you asked me to bail you out of jail so you could hit me up for a job? No, that's not...
you're fucking amazing.
so, listen, since you're playing catch-up,
I'm gonna take the lead at DollaHyde. The meeting was at 10: 00. Who cares?
they need us to put a shitload of paper in they pocket.
why don't you shut the fuck up? - Attitude.
I like it. - Drug dealers.
so DollaHyde's seed money... Did not come from a venture capital firm.
and I'd gotten so used to consulting for white-collar criminals.
I want him out. Any way you can convince him to sell?
lukas is all, "DollaHyde my baby." Well, DollaHyde my baby, too.
and he's gonna fuck us up. No, he's not.
shit.
fuck.
shit.
Oh, hey, Dad, coffee's on.
Oh, hey, I just really need some water.
hello.
is that my shirt?
huh? Oh! Yeah, I think it is.
sorry, you can have it back. Lea-Leave it on, leave it on.
leave it on. Jesus Christ.
Oh, hey, Chantelle.
Hey, Chantelle..." Wait a minute. What in the...
grandpa's new friend.
grandpa's new friend.
do your parents know you've been out on a school night, Chantelle?
I did hear you were funny.
and I've heard nothing about you.
Where's that water, kitten? I'm parched.
need it to wash down that Viagra? Will you be cool?
are you kidding me? This is appropriate to you?
what the fuck is going on? What's it look like's going on?
look, this is ridiculous. I think she's a little young even for me, Pop.
Oh, well, good.
name is Chantelle. Yes. Yeah.
I got that piece of information.
Where'd you meet her? Spearmint Rhino?
at a talk I gave. Mm-hmm.
she's a therapist.
yeah... she's a therapist finishing up her doctorate. Ooh.
I want her to feel welcome. Well, I think you already handled that.
all right?
welcome, Chantelle. See you kids later.
and, Chantelle...
my house is not clothing-optional, okay? Go put your Garanimals on.
Oh, boy. This day just gets better and better.
Hey, Mom.
you, uh, you trolling for pussy at, uh, Color Me Mine, Marty?
she's a little young, even for you.
she's not with me, okay? She's with... I... I...
could not care less.
Yeah, that makes two of us. She's with me.
sweetie, come on.
actually, I haven't had breakfast yet, Mom.
we'll get a frappuccino on the way to school. Yay.
love you, Grandpa. - Bye, Chantelle. - Bye.
gross. Come on.
Ah... - No, you don't get it.
you've never worked for a top-tier consulting firm before.
that's true. Right.
so you would have no idea about the pressures.
if I could get back to my old boss... Marty, right?
you think he's the answer? Yes. Yeah.
Yeah. I just need one big fucking move.
Clyde, when you go through a break like you did, you need to do some hard work with what you feel is the reason.
how's business here, by the way?
cause I could show you and your partners how to blast open those profit margins.
it looks like you could use it a tiny bit. Obviously, that's not an option.
Oof!
almost went over. That's 50 minutes.
all right, Clyde.
now, if I could just see your court card.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, and if you can just throw me that little script for Wellbutrin you want me on.
and then throw in some Xanax there as well, that'd be great.
I am gonna up that Wellbutrin, and no Xanax. No Xanax?
you good with that? That's fine.
okay. Okay.
okay. Mmm... I'm ready now. Yeah, yeah.
put your baby juice in me. What?
I can feel a life starting with every thrust.
Really? Do it!
can you see our adorable child? Uh... yeah...
he's being made right now, babe. And he has your eyes.
and he's got a cute little penis... Oh, God. ...
just like his father.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
that was... felt so good. Mmm.
honey? Mm-hmm?
did you come? What?
because it totally d... it didn't seem like you did.
what are you talking about? No, I-I made the noise and everything.
of course I came.
I didn't come.
I've been withholding orgasm since she decided... we decided to, uh, get pregnant.
why don't you just tell her that you don't want a baby, Doug?
I mean, instead of telling me. Because I want to want a baby.
I just... it's odd, and it's all happening so fast.
Hey, I mean, I hear you.
who wants to be a milk machine for a bunch of teeny-tiny assholes?
not me, but... Just tell her.
I don't know. There's still so much I haven't done.
like spelunking.
or-or participating in an authentic sweat lodge ritual.
or hanging out with Marty more. Marty's never gonna hang out with you, Doug.
that's mean.
Ah, shit. Oh, God.
J- Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, wait.
see, the problem is, I got interrupted, so it really hurts, you know?
Sarah's got these moves that really get me there, so I'm right on the verge of... Yuck.
Yuck. Listen.
why don't you just jerk off at home in the shower?
uh, yeah, like a savage. Are you kidding me?
that requires preparation.
uh, lighting. Props.
a little Maroon 5. Oh, God, I wish Clyde was here.
to jerk you off? What? Of course not.
no, because he would understand. You know, it's a guy thing.
it's not funny, Jeannie. This hurts. Well, great.
well, why don't you just do it here before we go?
uh... yeah, okay. Are you gonna stay, or...?
you can if you want.
not in my office, Doug. Right! No.
of course not. You meant in the building.
okay.
do not take a mental picture of me. I wasn't.
all right, kids. Oh, God.
it's time to make moves so we can go do our little sell job on Lukas and get him up out of that com...
everything okay down there? Oh, yeah, fine.
he's withholding orgasm.
right. Oh.
my man Marty. You got serious game.
I got game?
is this what we pay you for? To watch my black ass?
I've had worse engagements. I know players.
and you are a player,
miss Jeannie Van Der... whatever the fuck your name is.
I know how you people do.
you throw around a lot of jargon, try to confuse me, make me think I can't live without your wisdom.
you don't trust us?
well, that's all right. I don't trust you, either.
but you do like me.
Hey, Spanky, quit eye-fucking me!
what? I-I wasn't.
I was looking at the hole. For the hole.
she grabs a letter opener, stabs her in fucking leg.
but the good thing is that if I stab her ass now, there's been a precedent set, you know what I mean? Like it's a viable option.
get the fuck out of here. Yeah, well, women, I...
can't get in love with them, can't cli-climax in them.
all right, Dre, come on, man, you're up. I'll be down there in a second.
Yeah, good luck, Doug.
Hey, Marty. Um...
I thought the goal of today was to be working Lukas, not making goo-goo eyes at your new BFF.
goo-goo eyes? I mean, you're cute together, but...
did you forget that Dre was a client?
Oh. Dre's a client. That's right. Right.
how many clients do you clear your entire schedule to go golfing with?
or tell intimate details of your life to?
you hate everybody, Marty. Except your new bro.
Oh, wait a minute.
are you saying because he's a black guy I'm-I'm friends with him now?
racist!
what I'm saying is that because Dre is becoming your friend, he is literally different than every other person on the planet.
and how many friends does Jeannie have?
let me see.
two, seven, 46... carry the nine...
zero. I don't need friends, Marty.
I'm pretty. Here we go.
well, look like this six-figure membership didn't come with any skills, did it, Dre?
Hey, I got skills, motherfucker. I got skills.
I just can't find 'em right now.
I would check your back pocket. You're up.
no, no, no, no.
Jeannie-bean? The-the ladies' tees are up front.
I like it.
welcome.
you have a visitor.
Clyde.
Hi, Clyde.
I will leave you to it. Thank you.
I like the house.
so...
you were surprised to see me? Yeah.
Yeah. It's been a long time, right? Hope we could relate a little bit, because I have actually been in a little bit of a mess myself.
I was in one of those meetings, um...
court-mandated meeting because there was an arrest involved. Oh.
Yeah, there's nothing violent, nothing like that.
but when I was there, someone told me that you were here.
I'm telling you, the second... the second they said your name to me,
I just thought that I could just turn your life around.
and I think I can get your business back for you.
Oh, my God.
I know. It would be like heaven, right?
no, Clyde. You're a bottom-feeder.
no, you're not getting my intention... I mean, I'm at my lowest point here.
I'm trying to survive.
I mean, look at me. I'm-I'm shaking.
and here you are, some guy that I hooked up with once at New Year's...
it was Hanukkah.
taking advantage of my vulnerability to make a buck. Come on.
now, that's not fair, okay?
I'm not trying to take advantage of anything. At the very least,
I'm making sure you're okay.
I'm just fucking with you. God!
you're just fucking with me? Okay.
I am so fucking bored in here.
you want to see where they make us pee in a cup?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, let's go. Yeah.
uh, tee box is full. All right, crackers, come on.
get your ass out the way. We playing through. Not now, right now.
sorry, white people.
sorry for what?
so, since you are literally charging us by the second, why don't you let us hear what you got.
uh, we ran an 8020 statistical analysis on the Walmart expansion, and, um... it's potentially lucrative.
now wait one goddamn minute.
would you run that back to me one mo 'gin without all the fancy bullshit consultant rhetoric?
you were right. Whoo! Goddamn it!
sound even better than when I say it.
now why don't you tell me how much you billed me to tell me that I was right?
uh, we had to do a little more than that.
you see, we had to run a side-by-side analysis of the Walmart expansion given your current brand recognition in key demos.
and survey says!
you got to expand the brand if you want Joe Six-pack to know he's got to have it.
now, we ran some ideas for said expansion.
and a very cool backpack and carrying case line is the frontrunner.
what? Luggage?
right.
fuck out of here. I like it.
I bet you do like it, you fucking Barney's-wearing motherfucker you.
Hey, I'm not gonna be too many more motherfuckers.
Lukas, their revenue projections are off the charts.
and it can be tailored to the DollaHyde brand, so graffiti artist tablet covers and titanium laptop roller bags.
I mean, dope! No, Doug.
listen, Lukas, DollaHyde may actually be able to do something that no other clothing line has been able to crack yet.
Hey, man, this all the fuck you got?
let me let each and every last one of you in on a little secret.
DollaHyde sells lifestyle.
that said lifestyle has jack shit to do with luggage.
get the fuck out my way. Yeah, of course.
so there's the garden, whatever. Okay, listen, here's the thing.
you have a ticket out of here.
you pioneered one of the top Web sites in the world.
Mediawolf is major currency, and that's your fucking baby.
well, hate to break it to you, but it's not mine anymore.
point for my siblings! I know.
I know your family... And now I live here with dreamcatcher lady and the other one who sold her kids' schoolbooks for crack.
it's my family's fun little game of defaming me for their own amusement; they have conservatorship.
it's like I can't have a drink in my personal time... Right, right. .
like an adult Or a fucking eight ball.
Yes, exactly! Yes, I get it!
they just expect you to be a pretty face and have the occasional three-way with Paris Hilton.
but fuck that. You made good.
so good, that with your family's expiring media empire hitting a wall, they put you here so they can get their hands on your fucking beautiful Internet cash cow.
Mm. You rehearse that on the way over?
listen, you're here because they want Mediawolf.
there's no other reason. Truth.
I'm here because I can help save it for you.
and I can get you out of this fucking place, which is insane.
Mm. I forget, do you like anal?
you speak Korean? Okay...
I just... I want to know you.
God, are you kidding me? No.
Marissa, I can get you not only the Web site, I can get you the whole fucking family nut.
but you have to do exactly what I tell you to do.
you're pretty cute in that suit. You don't stop.
and if I remember correctly, your thing was going downtown.
Mm. That was your thing, right?
this what you want to talk about? Yeah.
I find you insanely fuckable.
and I fully intend to get in some Korean anal with you the second I have a chance.
promise?
Oh, God, here, pinky promise.
can't break a pinky promise.
I never will. Okay.
professionally, I'm extremely disappointed in you,
Jeannie Van Der Whatever-the-fuck.
I thought that you would be into the idea.
I misjudged. What can I say?
what could you have said? You could have said sneakers.
what's up with your man? Sneakers?
Yeah, sneakers. The little white motherfuckers with the laces.
you wear 'em on your feet.
don't you think that's the first thing that we trotted out?
don't you think that's the first thing that every broke-ass hip-hop line tries?
those broke-ass hip-hop lines, they're fucking shit.
and you're what, a fucking sneaker genius?
you just know that your sneakers are gonna work, right?
for once, Marty Kaan, you just happen to be absolutely right.
I am a fucking genius, and my sneakers will absolutely fucking work.
you cannot expose DollaHyde's bottom line right before the IPO; it's way too risky.
he's right.
well, Marty, I mean, they did break through with DollaHyde.
Hey, I like this guy. He's a visionary.
no, no, that was at a time when everybody was looking for a funky alternative to The Gap or Abercrombie... Absolutely.
okay? Sneakers are blown out.
Yeah, but what if we built a firewall in between
DollaHyde and the sneaker entity? That would quarantine the risk.
you talking about splitting the company?
we'd have two companies rolling in the dough instead of one when it finally hits.
Yeah, but if what when it hits, it doesn't make enough noise?
do I look like a motherfucker that has a problem making noise?
never. I'm the loudest motherfucker you know.
I'm turned all the way up... knob broke, no remote.
you understand that? Decision's been made.
we doing it. Hit your fucking ball, Marty Kaan.
Oh, yeah.
are you fucking kidding me?
and the deed... is done.
don't give me any more details. I don't want a visual on this.
Hey, look, I don't know what you guys looking so shook for, man.
sneakers are gonna make us a lot of money.
I just run the numbers, you make the call. You goddamn right. You can thank me later.
luggage. Fucking idiot.
Oh, not an idiot, but...
all right, folks. Don't forget your seatbelt!
shut the fuck up, Doug. Okay.
DollaHyde, fool!
now that was some next-level shit, my man.
Oh, well, you gave me the sneakers.
we just had to make him think it was his idea.
so now what?
well, now all the capital stays with the clothing line, and Lukas gets 100% of nothing but a shoe.
and DollaHyde? DollaHyde is squeaky clean.
all bright and shiny for that groundbreaking IPO, and all yours.
that's what I'm talking about.
Yes, sir. You do not disappoint, my friend.
Whoo! Love it when you say that with the black power fist.
Oh, you know what? You should come over to my place tomorrow.
uh, yeah, I would love that.
I'm pretty sure he's talking to me. I want you to meet my fam.
you should bring Roscoe. Oh, all right, great.
OMG, what are you gonna wear?
you're welcome.
it's a great day for Kaan and Associates. Job well done.
yes...
Ooh, shoot.
Oh, Doug. Oh, God, Marty, please!
it's fine. A little club soda will get that out.
Ooh, boy, yeah, it was kind of like Mt. Vesuvius in there.
real buildup.
doctor says the damage isn't permanent, but it's still tender, and that's what worries me.
Oberholt! Clyde! Clyde, oh, my God.
how are you?
did you get my flowers? I thought it was a nice, masculine arrangement. What did you think?
I actually came to see Marty. I'm gonna drop a little intel on him.
he is probably getting a bikini wax for his date with Dre.
cause he so wants to fuck that guy.
okay. Ooh, hey, did you see the redhead?
which one is this?
??? The one I told you about, Caitlin. Yeah.
Yeah. Or as I call her, "Chiara." Why do you call her Chiara?
that's her name in Italian. It's kind of a thing we have.
every time I see her, I'm like, "Ciao, Chiara.
and she's just like, "Hi, Doug.
so she talks normally, and you talk like a big idiot. No, it's like a thing we have.
you and Marty still aren't in the best place, Clyde.
are you sure you want to...? Okay, Jeannie, you know what?
you're way less cute when you worry.
so do me a favor, chill the fuck out.
it's all good. Okay, whatever you say.
Bye.
Hey, buddy. Hmm?
I mean, she might have a point.
shouldn't you be taking it easy, after everything that's happened?
it doesn't even matter. That's in the past, okay?
I'm looking towards the future. And all I need is one minute with Marty.
no, what you need is to worry about your health, all right?
the little kid inside here. Oh...
the world can be a scary place for mavericks like us.
Mav...? Are you fucking kidding me?
what? Don't.
dude, you kill it at work, at this fucking place.
you're fucking brilliant. And now you have Sarah.
man, you have a fucking wife, someone who loves you.
you're probably gonna have some beautiful nerd family, okay?
I have nothing.
you have everything, and you don't even see it.
Yeah.
right? Yeah.
I need to get back here. All right.
Marty's fucked up just like me. He gets me.
I do?
you really think you can bring in the entire McClintock media empire?
I know I can.
was that...? Did I miss something?
was that the whole thing? This is a big whale, and I can bring it to your doorstep.
Oh, wow, I am so sorry you wasted your time and bus fare.
take care of yourself.
try to stay out of trouble.
Marty. Marty. And buh-bye.
Marty, we need this. Jeannie, -If he's... -He is not here to help us.
you understand? He's here to help himself.
again. It's McClintock.
hand delivered by Judas. I'm in the shit, right?
but I have been punished. Working for your ex-wife.
by fucking going to jail.
listen, I will never make the mistake that I made with you before.
come on, Marty.
what, are you gonna punish him forever? For one thing that he did?
what? You guys can't just start over?
I will not fuck this up.
this would be huge for Kaan and Associates.
we need the revenue. And we need the profile.
boss lady says it's a yes, so I guess it's a yes.
that's what I'm talking about.
thank you very much, and I will prove myself to you, okay?
thank you, boss lady. Weirdly emasculated boss man.
man, get the fuck out of here and get the money.
thank you, sir. I got this, okay?
it's so good, baby. All right. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.
you have everything, and you don't even see it.
Oh, my God, I did it!
I think I just put a baby in you!
Yeah, you did. Yeah!
Oh, sweet thing.
Yeah.
FYI... Yeah?
only one of us came.
Oh, yeah, no, right, of course! Cool.
no, oh, of course.
Yeah.
they think they can just get rid of me?
I was the linchpin behind that shit show.
what the hell's going on?
she got fired. Oh.
what happened?
supposedly, I create a hostile work environment.
you? Oh, no, do they have the right gal?
but, uh... that cretin that stabbed me?
she's just... somehow she's, uh, she's related to the treasury secretary.
fuck them.
right? Listen.
I can make some calls, okay?
I got your back, Mo.
I have pills for that. Thanks though.
well, I am off to meet Lex at the skate park.
Negatory. You are coming with me, and we are going to Dre's house.
Oh, awesome, yeah! Can-can I bring Lex though?
uh, no, no.
we are not bringing our family circus to a client's house.
I'm sorry. Well, fuck-that-shit. com.
because if I'm going, Lex is going.
whoa, did I miss the part where you're moving out?
cause as long as you live under this roof, you don't lip off to me.
so I should just act like you then?
uh, you better act like you're gonna get ready, okay?
before you and I have a real problem. But, Dad, we do have a problem.
you're calling me and Lex a circus.
I mean, Grampa would say I could bring Lex.
you know what? Grampa's not here, okay?
and I'm not gonna turn on the news to see if there's an Amber Alert out to find him.
now, go get ready, and get your mind right.
whatever.
the fuck?
sometimes, I...
wait, let me... let me... let me say it again with the right em-pha-sis.
I am a lucky motherfucker. Wait, hold on, scratch that.
an extremely handsome and lucky motherfucker. Ah, yes.
you know what I'm talking about? Let's get the order correct.
but you know on the real to real, sometimes I get this nagging feeling.
you know, that just one little tremor or shift of the earth...
all of this...
can just fucking go poof.
Mm. You know? You feel it, too.
I can tell.
Oh, and by the way, you are now a new member of the club.
stop playing games.
no wait list. I hooked it up.
my man, my man. Let's get something to eat.
like, just standing outside a grocery store with a clipboard, making people resent you and hate your cause...
hate the cause. ...is not gonna change the world.
Nope. Sorry.
so, let me get this straight... you are for the wholesale destruction of the rain forest.
exactly. I love it. Hey, what the hell y'all talking about?
Ah, who am I kidding?
I always sign. Oh, your wife's a big softie.
so, it must be awesome having a dad that really spends time with you.
and Dre Collins? Oh, God.
how lucky, right?
Oh, I'll get it. All right.
why does he always get to answer? I want to answer!
all right, baby, I'll let you do it next time. Okay?
can I just tell you this is probably the best meal I've had ever.
thank you.
baby, you are the best cook. Oh, God.
I don't even want to know what karma your mother is gonna send my way when she hears you say that.
it's Uncle Lukas. He wants to take me to a Clippers game tomorrow.
they're floor seats. Can I please go?
you got your science project to prepare, sweetie.
next time. Take Roscoe upstairs and show him your guinea pigs.
okay. Go ahead.
well, thank you. I mean, I love your house and how nice you guys have been to me.
you're welcome.
so, how's that? Yeah, how do you think it is?
my-my suggestion is you hold them underwater before they hit their teens.
I mean, it's not exactly what I thought I would be fielding, but I love him.
he's-he's a great kid. You know, I just want to...
just want to keep him safe.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
you know, from everything. Mm, beautiful.
Thanks, baby. Got you.
more wine?
Yeah.
now, don't laugh, but, uh... this is from my vineyard.
Oh, will you stop bragging already?
Yes, Marty. I also have a vineyard.
uh, yes, Dre, I heard you the first time.
you know, maybe Lukas is right. Maybe I am a little bougie at times.
Yeah, a little bit. Just a little something something.
a little something something. Not too crazy, but just sometimes.
Yeah, so, uh, about Lukas.
I mean, he's family, right?
depends on how you look at it.
okay. What?
are we now having second thoughts, Marty Kaan? No, no, no, I'm not saying that.
I just saying that...
you know, what we're about to do...
this isn't just some guy you work with.
there's no coming back from that.
you guys have a history together, right? A- A life basically together.
my life... it's in there.
that woman is the reason why I'm still alive.
now, look... I ain't trying to disrespect you.
you know what I'm saying? I ain't trying to be disrespectful at all, but...
I didn't come up like you.
every day was like a war for me.
and I fought that war for her, and now for my kids.
and they make me want to keep fighting that war for them.
lukas is dangerous to all that.
you don't have a lot of options.
with everything in my fucking heart, all I know is
I've got to protect this.
you know how that feels?
I do.
then let's do this.
