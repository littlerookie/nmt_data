I've told you.
I only know her name.
I have no idea. - I do.
but I'll need to use your phone.
what phone are you on?
just listen to me.
I need to know where and when your next meeting with Susan b is.
Garfield-price building downtown in an hour. Why?
Garfield-price, one hour.
can you give her a message for me? - Yeah.
tell her everything is going as planned.
what the hell's going on, Michael?
just give her the message, Linc.
I'll see you soon.
you should have listened.
are you going to throw down a chicken foot over a puddle of puke?
you should have mopped.
stumpy, wait your turn, man.
excuse me.
what you want to see him about?
I got one ofhese from him, and I didn't do nothing.
he don't listen.
the fight goes on as planned-- after we eat lunch.
you issue a fight? - Yeah.
what about it?
it's not your right.
it's not your place.
well, maybe it should be.
general: She's arrived?
I'm on my way.
you'd better be right.
what happened?
it worked.
it did? - Yeah.
she came up to me just like you said and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.
so we stick with the plan, right?
Yeah. - Cool.
I'm going to see her right now.
it's okay.
I came back for you.
come on, now, everything's gonna be okay.
you can't deprive yourself like this.
G-get out of here.
you don't mean that.
yeah... yeah, I do. I do.
talk straight.
you're not talking straight.
withdrawals are the worst way to die.
you're going to shake, and you'll sweat until you evaporate into nothing.
it's a long bumpy road to hell.
is that what you want, Alex? Or do you wanna live?
see you on the other side.
when you're up all night...
with diarrhea running down both your legs and vomit is in your hair...
...don't come crawling back.
it's been a long day.
let's just get this over with.
I got a message from my brother.
everything is going ahead as planned.
Really?
I would think you'd be facing a major setback.
you know Michael.
always has things worked out.
no, I don't.
seems to me he keeps screwing things up.
he's getting things done a whole lot faster than you.
Whistler's out by tomorrow, all right?
Zavala: Gretchen Morgan?
Yes.
general Zavala, Panamanian national police.
come with us, please.
Why? What's this all about? - Llevenla.
no, I don't understand. I don't understand. Wait!
I had nothing to do with this.
I had nothing to do with this! Nothing!
you're denying that you are involved with escape attempts at Sona prison.
I have never been here before in my life.
and you've never met any of the men incarcerated here?
No!
James whistler?
no.
you know what I've been told?
from prisoners?
I can only imagine.
I've been told that you are the mastermind behind a prison escape and that you've kidnapped a boy as collateral.
Really?
am I an alien?
did I shoot?
sir, I have no idea who this James Wilson...
Whistler. - ...Is!
I'm just here to relax before I have to go back to another year of teaching social studies to freshman idiots.
you're a tourist here?
no, not a tourist, sir.
I like to think of myself as a "student of life."
"a student of life"?
what did he say?
turn on the hose.
I'm going to give you one chance.
did you order the escape from Sona penitentiary?
yes or no?
Zavala: Yes or no?
you seem concerned for her.
she holds our entire future in her hands.
Yeah, I'm concerned.
yes or no?
No!
you've proven one thing.
this is not your first time.
come with me.
do you know either of these men?
I've never seen them before.
that's a lie.
I've never seen them before in my life.
where and when have you seen her?
she came to see him in visitation, isn't that right?
is this the woman you work for?
did she order the prison escape?
yes or no?
Yes.
all right, all right.
you're the one in charge?
no.
I don't know anything about a prison escape.
I'm just the baby-sitter.
I watch the kid.
where is he?
near Paloma.
Highway 2.
I can take you.
take them back to my office.
put the girl back in the car.
we're going on a drive.
was it you?
did you kill Sara?
I have no idea who you're talking about.
I'm coming for you.
Congratulations.
you're a regular Buster Douglas, aren't you?
Hey, what is this?
how'd you get that up there, huh?
right there. Right there. He's in there.
in here?
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
: I hope he's all right.
pick me up.
I'm at the shack.
bring towels.
Hi, Lincoln.
good to see you.
Yeah, thanks for the cigars.
you didn't open the package?
I didn't get around to it today.
you need to make a choice.
Lechero's days are numbered.
you agree?
then you know what you need to do.
you've done a good job so far.
now is the time to make a move.
prove yourself.
go back in and open the package.
what are they doing in here?
they were here for questioning.
come on. Let's go.
what happened to the general?
the general was found dead this morning off highway 2.
you're goingback inside.
I'm sorry to hear that.
he seemed like a nice man.
what you doing back here?
if you still want to getout of here, I need your phone.
go inside.
what?
how's LJ?
he's fine. You know what?
Susan's not.
he's fine? Are you sure?
Yeah.
I just got off the phone with him.
why didn't you tell me what was going on?
he could have died because of what you did.
we've still got whistler.
as long as we do, we're okay.
I got to go.
Hey, did you see Blanco?
s walking around like the landlord.
I thought you said Lechero was going to take care of it?
he will.
how long has he been saying that?
look if you and Lechero want to go around like an old married couple, fighting this way or that... maybe you like it in the kitchen.
Hey, you be careful.
then do something!
or the next thing you know, you're gonna be taking orders from scofield.
some people stop at nothing, huh?
uh... yeah. Whatever.
at least we're back inside.
which of course is exactly what you wanted.
isn't it?
what are you talking about?
you let the fox into the henhouse.
the only reason you gave up gretchen's name was so she could come in and pull you out of the fire.
you wanted me to give up her name.
you know it doesn't end with her.
Yeah, I do.
the question is how do you?
how does a simple fisherman seem to know so much about the company?
when she comes back, and she will... ...
what am I gonna say?
you gonna do this or not?
you can tell her the answer is yeS.
but once we're out, I consider you collateral...
nothing more.
how does a simple fishman know so much about the company?
you gonna do this or not?
Yes, but once we're out, I consider you collateral.
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.
he needs to get out of his own way, and I think
you can assist him. I stay one step ahead,
and you get 50 grand.
what happened?
she came up to me just like you said
and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.
so we stick to the plan, right?
Yeah. cool.
I found a passport. who's Gary Miller?
I've been working on a way for us to be together.
James, how-how can I believe you?
Hocan I believe anything anymore?
we got a way out of this?
we need some kind of support brace for thtunnel.
or what? Or the whole thing collapses, and we're buried alive.
no more excuses.
Papa's dead because of this yankee.
I'll kill him myself if I have to, all right?
he survived the box.
so what?
the guards went after Scofield.
Scofield won.
he's a folk hero now.
look, I want Scofield dead as much as you,
but not at the cost of an uprising.
mail call.
who's that?
that's my son.
Bagwell gave the okay. the coast is clear.
we gotta go.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
once someone goes into the box, it's...
it was a misunderstanding.
they wanted to talk to you about the helicopters, right?
what helicopters?
were you really trying to escape?
I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you.
just so you know, Bagwell's coming with us.
you were gone.
he had something we needed.
I didn't have a choice.
fine.
so what's the new plan?
did you tell him?
Yeah.
I am coming with you.
okay by me.
everyone hear that? you hear that, lawman?
but you're staying up here.
maybe I didn't enunciate myself.
the work downstairs requires two hands.
Hey. we need somebody to stay outside in case Sammy returns.
I thought we couldn't dig through this stuff.
the bracing's gonna be tricky.
unless the tunnel gets the proper support,
it's all going to come down on our heads.
we should have the materials for the braces,
but we'll need a a saw to cut tto size. and a hammer.
can you help us out?
Yeah. I can do that.
two days.
and if not?
two days.
guillermo should have everything we need.
you know where he is, right?
I think it's, uh...
it's down this corridor on the left.
halfway down. cell 40.
down the corridor on the left.
cell 40. okey Doke.
are you lost already, Teodoro?
no.
but you are.
this is my room now.
you're done in here.
if you had gone after Scofield today,
all would have been forgiven.
this is suicide.
shut up, old man!
I'll take my chances.
you think you can run Sona?
you couldn't even run shipments from one dock to the other,
but I still keep you by my side.
I'll let you walk out of here
out of respect for what you were.
come on!
get the hell out of here!
all of you ready to do this?
until Lechero gets back,
we should start looking for pieces
about four feet in length.
I'm running things now!
anyone got problem with that...
...come get it!
good.
first order of business,
a case of rum to the man who brings me Michael Scofield!
don't worry.
we'll be there with all the cash.
okay? Gracias.
Osberto. that's who you want to talk to.
this guy on the up-and-up?
the guy I was running things into Sona for arranged this,
so it's as up as it's gonna get for this kind of deal. so, yes.
Osberto doesn't speak english, though,
so how do you want to work it?
I need to meet with Susan.
I'll take Sofia. she can translate for me.
don't worry about it.
so when I meet with Susan, what do you want me to tell her?
tell her whatever you think she wants to hear.
just buy us enough time to do our thing, all right?
home stretch, papi.
listen, man. I want to thank you for everything.
Oh, Linc, please. when we get home, I got your back
whatever you need, whatever you want.
that won't be necessary.
when I'm back home, I'm a saint.
I'm not even jaywalking.
Osberto. don't forget.
Osberto.
Scofield steps outside that tunnel, he's a dead man.
far as I can tell, we have two options.
we can invite Sammy on the escape...
he can go to hell.
which brings us to option number two.
you wouldn't last a second in there with Sammy.
would you?
then I guess we'll just have to outsource.
I felt sorry for the guy,
but you don't chicken-foot an ex-delta force
and expect to make it out alive.
you're delta force? like Chuck Norris?
Norris? he wouldn't have made it through boot camp.
excuse me a second.
I see you're making friends.
Hey, once you get the hang of it,
this place ain't so rough.
Yeah. too bad.
too bad what?
you were right. we got a little plan going on. but, you know, if you're putting down roots...
no, no. you were saying...?
we're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours.
not through Scofield.
you heard the town crier.
college boy's life is barely worth a case of booze.
hence our current conversation.
I know how you got your cherry yesterday,
daubing your wraps in acetone,
smothering the guy until he passed out from the fumes.
you do the same thing to Sammy, and you're in.
chicken-foot Sammy?
chicken-foot Sammy.
it's all riding on you, champ.
here you get it.
thank you.
this shouldn't take long.
what are you getting?
supplies. for?
I don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
you know no. what that means?
well, these people obviously have a plan.
we're gonna need one, too.
does that plan include screwing over James?
is it James or gary Miller?
whatever his name is, there's a part of me
that doesn't want to believe he works for them...
cause he's the man I loved,
the man who went to prison for me,
the man who was going to take me to my first trip to Paris.
I haven't turned my back to that man.
do I have your word that he's gonna be all right?
Yeah. Now get in.
do I have your word?!
Yeah, you got my word.
now get in.
ed, we'll be in contact soon. Sales are through the roof!
hope you're working on your putting...Gary
you know what st found out?
that "Sucre" means "sugar.
Yeah.
so every time I say your name,
I'm calling you "sugar.
basically.
I like that.
look, I don't have a lot of information.
which, I guess, that's good ws for you, right?
you care to elaborate?
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.
he's still planning on exchanging Whistler for Lj.
he hasn't been talking about running any games.
and did he become an eagle scout last night, too?
lady, he got the message. he knows he doest have
a choice, he has to play it straight.
look, I could have come up here and made something up
just to get paid, but...
I'm not trying to get on your bad side either.
you know what?
I believe you.
so, I'll call you if anything comes up.
whoa, whoa! what am I, a toothless crack whore?
sit down.
I keep my promises.
the people I work for, they don't like to deal in greenbacks; it's just too bulky.
cashier's check payable to cash. same thing.
half now and half when you're done.
keep your ears open, sugar.
Alex, come on!
hold it steady! I am! I am!
I'm gonna need a little help here!
come on.
I got it. I said I got it.
Thittle piece of metal's gonna hold all this weight?
all right,
let go, let go.
so, how many more are we gonna need before we get to the top?
20 maybe.
that gets us to no-man's land. then what?
Helicopter'd be nice.
I was supposed to kill you.
Oh, so you're not a fisherman?
they threatened to come after my family
if I didn't kill you and jump on that helicopter,
but I didn't.
I'm so grateful.
so what happened to your family?
I don't know. maybe I'll find out if we ever get out of here.
well, it's a crazy world, isn't it?
we all agreen that.
and we have a lot of work to do.
where the hell is Lechero?
is everything set? huh?
is everything set?
Yeah, noblemo.
excuse me, sir.
do we come to you if we need the chicken foot?
tiger pants.
who you got a beef with?
I don't know his name. Some Caribbean guy.
stole my wallet a while back.
better think long and hard before you say another word, eh?
he's got this fruity little mustache
and this ly-ass vest.
please, I'm beggin' ya.
in the ring. 15 minutes.
I never thought I'd say this,
but I envy you, Brad. I've wanted to shank that little calypso kid Ever since I first met him.
I'm not a violent guy by nature,
but if a man makes me walk around in my grunts for two days...
Yeah, that's great. just don't take too long to finish him off, okay?
the sooner he's dead, the sooner we can get on the escape.
no games. I'm in.
you're in.
no, no, no. what's wrong?
we got to call off the fight.
no, that's an impossibility.
no, no, no,
you don't understand!
there's got to be more acetone around here.
no, that's it! I can't go against
Sammy straight up! I'm a dead man!
if you don't kill him, we are all dead.
this isn't the best neighborhood.
I've been in a lot worse.
just stick close.
Osberto?
you want to do this?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
where is the money?
I want to see the product.
money first.
show me the stuff.
lincoln, please, let's get out of here.
tell him to stop wasting my time.
no.
tell him.
Oh, my god!
big? it's grande?
ask him how do I trigger it by remote.
boom.
dial one-one, send.
one-one, send?
why didn't you tell me you were gonna buy a bomb?
you never d have come otherwise.
we need that saw.
you know, uh,
I am a fisherman.
I am. I'm just maybe
a little bit more connected than I've let on.
I think this is gonna work.
Yeah.
you know, I run charters, just like I said...
I have for years.
then one day, that brunette, Gretchen well, she asked me
if I wanted to be exclusive to her corporation, right?
and, uh, well, with the money she was offering,
I had a pretty good idea she wasn't Just trawling for salmon.
so you two have history.
Yeah. and she's been an absolute nightmare in my life
ever since that first job.
Alex, I need a wedge.
wedge.
look, I took 'em where they wanted me to take 'em.
I have to figure outhese coordinates
and I have to take them back there.
quit embarrassing yourself.
what?
we're not two chicks at a bar you're trying to pick up.
this?
no. all right, good. you work for the company.
and when you break out of here, you're gonna do whatever The company asks you to do,Period.
well, they're using me
just like they're g you.
good, I'm glad you shared that with me.
so why don't we go back to work? How's that sound?
let those idiots chickenfoot themselves all they want, huh?
but if one of them tries to use it on us...
you don't have to fight that guy.
it's my farewell tour.
the rest of those pieces are no good.
we're going to need those tools, Michael.
I guess we'll just have to wait.
that book of yours-- it's just a bunch of coordinates in there, right?
among other things.
so you wouldn't mind.
it's just a bunch of, uh, numbers and dates.
gate.
gate Netting company.
that's where I rent my trammels.
stampede.
that's my buddy's cape islander.
and this is important to us how?
it's important because I'm being accused of being someone I'm not.
and I don't want
Scofield ditching me Once it's time to leave...
he's not ditching anybody.
if he could have gotten rid of anybody,
he would have gotten rid of me.
and if he tries to leave the city
he knows that we're gonna turn him in before he gets out of the city.
I'm going upstairs to find Lechero and his equipment.
I'm with Alex.
do you mind?
sounds like someone's up there.
if Lechero gets stranded up there,
we're not getting out of here.
so when you think it's safe,
or it feels like
it's safe, we got to go, we got to go up.
we've been talking about chickenfooting Sammy for months.
no one had the courage.
do you have any paint thinner?
paint thinner?
shoe polish,
lighter fluid, glue?
there you are, champ.
it's time. stomp his face, Brad!
you know, this has all been one big misunderstanding.
I wasn't talking about Sammy.
it was... that's him.
that's the guy I was talking about.
Yeah, I don't see no "fruity moustache,
and where's his "ugly-ass vest," Brad?
don't worry, you stand a real chance of winning this one.
you cannot just hide out all day.
what else can I do, huh?
I've ruled hese men for a year with blood.
you don't think those men want to take the head of the man
who wore the crown? Be that as it may,
bellick is about to lose his head to Sammy.
you may not want to hear this,
but once that happens, we are both very much
aware that Scofield is gonna start
getting curious about where the hell you are.
he's going to come crawling out of his hole
and right into Sammy's arms,
and then he and our escape Are gone forever
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick,
Bellick, Bellick, Bellick, Bellick...
wait. we get the tools and we come straight back.
come on
Hey.
you guys want to watch the fight?
you know, chill out.
I'll get you a beer.
you like that?
you like that?
stop it.
Scofield!
Scofield's in there.
it's locked. Open the door.
I don't have the combination.
I said...
open it now.
do it.
we can't.
we can't.
open it now.
I don't have the combination.
I've got your man out here.
if you don't open the door,
he's the one who's going to pay the price.
I need him alive!
you saw those guys. what do you think they've got planned?
all of you is trying my patience.
what do you suggest, Alex?
let's be ready for them.
time's up.
you want another one?
then you better be persuasive.
Michael.
don't open the door!
he's got a gu...!
are you going to tell me what it's for? no.
because you think I might tell James?
because you don't need to know.
Hey.
it's going to be all right.
how'd it go? good. I told her what she wanted to hear,
just like you told me.
that it? yeah.
cool. listen, I want you to call her up,
tell her you've got some information.
make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right?
okay. Is everything okay?
Yeah. Why?
she looks upset.
I'll call you later.
got something down here we can use, Michael.
if they come through that door...
you hit them right here.
go ahead, take it.
go ahead.
it'll puncture the heart.
you were hiding Scofield in your room?
look at you-- the power make you mad already.
come along, Norman.
let's go.
what is so urgent?
Lincoln bought a gun.
I... I asked him what he planned on doing with it,
but he wouldn't answer.
so I just... I just thought you might want to know.
if anything changes, I'll get back to you, okay?
you know, the other day
when you and Lincoln had your little spat in the lobby
and you-- all distraught and jilted
went across the street to the bar,
a cynic might think that was staged.
I'm a cynic, sugar.
you're high, sugar.
if it's any comfort, you guys almost pulled it off.
the Puerto Rican and the gorilla
you really had me scrambling there for a minute.
Hey, if you don't want my help, fine, I'm out, okay?
it's a little thing called a tracing number
on the check I gave you.
apparently your extensive expertise in banking Failed you that day.
you promptly wired all 25 k
to Maricruz Delgado in chicago
at 123 please don't hurt me lane.
I swear to god, if something happens to her...
if what?!
what, jackass?!
you're going to go back there and you're going to get me
some real information,
or Maricruz and her head are going to part ways.
get out of my car.
now.
Hey, Blanco.
I got your good buddy Lechero here.
why don't you give it the secret knock so he knows it's you, huh?
the combination.
what makes you think I have the combination?
just do what he says. huh?
how many times you gonna pull that little thing out?
as many times as I feel necessary.
what, you think it make you look strong?
all it does is magnify your weakness.
funny, I'm feeling pretty
security right about now.
now, the combination, old man. we're not asking again.
Sammy!
I'm opening the door.
Michael, do not open the...
drop them!
drop them, I said
now move!
you're escaping with him?
I was gonna tell you all about this, Bredda.
it just never camep, eh?
take it.
it's yours.
the tunnel,
the escape plan, everything.
we can go together.
I'm taking everything you took.
but you ain't going nowhere.
how you finishing up this hole?
promise me you'll take Whistler with you.
you making demands on me?
I understand...
why you're going to kill me,
but he's done nothing wrong.
I'll tell you everything you need to know,
just take him with you.
you need him.
he's the only one who figured this one out.
don't you worry, I'll take care of yor friend.
all right.
first, you need to keep building braces to support the tunnel as you go.
how you do that?
Whistler can show you how.
look like you just
make some wood squares from these boxes here.
like I said,
Whistler can show you.
how much further to the surface?
not far.
can't be more than ten feet.
impressive, Blanco.
too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.
how long is this going to set us back?
what's gonna set us back is if the tower guards are looking at a giant sinkhole out in no man's land.
Michael?
we're good.
Yeah.
we're good.
back in business.
I'm in.
for what, getting your ass kicked?
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.
you're in, champ.
okay, you need to stay here.
I got to get something, all right?
don't move.
can you get home from here?
Yeah, I'm two blocks away.
if he doesn't take you, I will.
here.
use this.
Thanks.
right there.
you know, for all the times you wanted me to prove I was a fisherman,
I should have been asking if you were a real engineer.
that could've been one of us buried down there.
I'll do bett next time.
I'm gonna go back down and try to salvage some of those braces.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
never gets any easier.
all the side jobs I do at Sona for three years. I save all of my money.
it's $173.
if you're really leaving, it's yours.
take me with you.
please?
I don't want to be here anymore.
you don't want any part of this.
you got a plan or are we back to square one?
I have a plan. good, cause I got something cooking on tutside.
I ain't walking into a buzzsaw again.
how you dealing with the animals in here?
actually, it's starting to feel like home.
Whistler still pretending he's a fisherman and all this?
Why? Sofia found a passport in one of the apartments he kept.
name's Gary Miller.
I'm shocked. guy's a fraud, michael.
as far as I know, there ain't fish in Scottsdale.
well, if he's not a fisherman... what is he?
how does a simple fisherman know so much about the company?
you gonna do this or not?
Yes, but once we're out, I consider you collateral.
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.
he needs to get way, and I think you can assist him.
I stay one step ahead, and you get 50 grand.
what happened?
she came up to me just like you said and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.
so we stick to the plan, right? - Yeah.
cool.
I found a passport.
who's gary miller?
I've been working on a way for us to be together.
James, how-how can I believe you?
how can I believe anything anymore?
we got a way out of this?
we need some kind of support brace for the tunnel.
or what?
or the whole thing collapses, and we're buried alive.
no more excuses.
Papa's dead because of this yankee.
I'll kill him myself if I hav he survived the box.
so what?
the guards went after scofield.
Scofield won.
he's a folk hero now.
look, I want scofield dead as much as you, but not at the cost of an uprising.
mail call.
who's that?
that's my son.
Bagwell gave the okay.
the coast is clear.
we gotta go.
I didn't think I'd see you again.
once someone goes into the box, it'S...
it was a misunderstanding.
they wanted to talk to you about the helicopters, right?
what h were you really trying to escape?
I don't know what you're talking about, and neither do you.
just so you know, bagwell's coming with us.
you were gone.
he we needed. I didn't have a choice.
fine.
so what's the new plan?
did you tell him? - Yeah.
I am coming with you.
okay by me.
everyone heau hear that, lawman?
but you're staying up here.
maybe I didn't enunciate myself.
the work downstairs requires two hands.
Hey.
we need somebody to stay outside in case sammy returns.
I thought we couldn't dig through this stuff.
the bracing's gonna be tricky.
unless the tunnel gets the proper support, it's all going to come down on our heads.
we should have the materials for the braces, but we'll need a a saw to cut them to size.
and a hammer.
can you help us out?
Yeah. I can do that.
two days.
and if not?
two days
guillermo should have everything we need.
you know where he is, right?
I think it's, uh...
it's down this corridor on the left.
halfway down.
cell 40.
down the corridor on the left. Cell 40.
Okeydoke.
are you lost already, teodoro?
no.
but you are.
this is my room now.
you're done in here.
if you had gone after scofield today, all would have been forgiven.
this is suicide.
shut up, old man!
I'll take my chances.
Yeah. You think you can run sona?
you couldn't even run shipments from one dock to the other, but I still keep you by my side.
I'll let you walk out of here out of respect for what you were.
come on!
get the hell out of here!
all of you ready to do this?
until lechero gets back, we should start looking for pieces about four feet in length.
I'm running things now!
anyone got a p.
come get it!
good.
first order of business, a case of rum to the man who brings me michael scofield!
don't worry we'll be there with all the cash okay? Gracias.
that's who you want to talk to.
this guy on the up-and-up?
the guy I was running things into sona for arranged this, so it's as up as it's gonna get for this kind of deal.
so, yes.
Osberto doesn't speak english, though, so how do you want to work it?
I need to meet with susan.
I'll take sofia. She can translate for me.
don't worry about it.
so when I meet with susan, what do you want me to tell her?
tell her whatever you think she wants to hear.
just buy us enough time to do our thing, all right?
home stretch, papi.
listen, man. I want to thank you for everything.
Oh, linc, please.
when we get home, I got your back -
whatever you need, whatever you want.
that won't be necessary.
when I'm back home, I'm a saint.
I'm not even jaywalking.
Osberto. Don't forget.
Scofield steps outside that tunnel, he's a dead man.
far as I can tell, we have two options.
we can invite sammy on the escape...
he can go to hell.
which brings us to option number two.
you wouldn't last a second in there with sammy.
would you?
then I guess we'll just have to outsource.
I felt sorry for the guy, but you don't chicken-footan ex-delta force and expect to make it out alive.
you're delta force?
like chuck norris?
Norris? He wouldn't have made it through boot camp.
ex
I see you're making friends.
Hey, once you get the hang of it, this place ain't so rough.
Yeah.
too bad.
too bad what?
you were right. We got a little plan going on.
but, you know, if you're putting down roots...
no, no.
you were saying...
we're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours.
not through scofield.
you heard the town crier.
college boy's life is barely worth a case of booze.
hence our current conversation.
I know how you got your cherry yesterday, daubing your wraps in acetone, smothering the guy until he passed out from the fumes.
you do the same thing to sammy, and you're in.
chicken-foot sammy?
chicken-foot sammy.
it's all riding on you, champ.
thank you.
this shouldn't take long.
what are you getting?
supplies.
for?
I don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
you know what that means?
no.
well, these people obviously have a plan.
we're gonna need one, too.
does that plan include screwing over james?
is it james or gary miller?
whatever his name is, there's a part of me that doesn't want to believe he works for them...
cause he's the man I loved, the man who went to prison for me, the man who was going to take me to my first trip to paris.
I haven't turned my back to that man.
do I have your word that he's gonna be all right?
Yeah.
now get in.
do I have your word?!
Yeah, you got my word.
now get in.
ed, we'll be in contact soon. sales are through the roof!
hope you're working on your putting...gary
you nd out?
that "sucre" means "sugar.
Yeah.
so every time I say your name, I'm calling you "sugar.
basically.
I like that.
look, I don't have a lot of information.
which, I guess, that's good news for you, right?
you care to elaborate?
Lincoln isn't cooking anything up.
he's still planning on exchanging whistler for lj.
he hasn't been talking about running any games.
and did he become an eagle scout last night, too?
lady, he got the message.
he knows he doesn't have a choice, he has to play it straight.
look, I could have come up here and made something up just to get paid, but...
I'm not trying to get on your bad side either.
you know what?
I believe you.
so, I'll call you if anything comes up.
whoa, whoa! What am I, a toothless crack whore?
sit down.
I keep my promises.
le I work for, they don't like to deal in greenbacks; it's just too bulky.
cashier's check payable to cash.
same thing.
half now and half when you're done.
keep your ears open, sugar.
Alex, come on!
hold it steady!
I am! I am!
I'm gonna need a little help here!
I got it. I said I got it.
that little piece of metal's gonna hold all this weight?
all right, let go, let go.
so, how many more are we gonna need before we get to the top?
20 maybe.
that gets us to no-man's land.
then what?
Helicopter'd be nice.
Hey, I was supposed to kill you.
Oh, so you're not a fisherman?
they threatened to come after my family if I didn't kill you and jump on that helicopter, but I didn'T.
I'm so grateful.
so what happened to your family?
I don't know.
maybe I'll find out if we ever get out of here.
well, it's a crazy world, isn't it?
we all agree on that.
and we have a lot of work to do.
where the hell is lechero?
is everything set?
huh?
is everything set?
Yeah, no problemo.
excuse me, sir.
do we come to you if we need the chicken foot?
tiger pants.
who you got a beef with?
I don't know his name.
some caribbean guy.
stole my wallet a while back.
better think long and hard before you say another word, eh?
he's got this fruity little mustache and this ugly-ass vest.
please, I'm beggin' ya.
in the ring.
15 minutes.
I never thought I'd say this, but I envy you, brad.
I've wanted to shank that little calypso kid ever since I first met him.
I'm not a violent guy by nature, but if a man makes me walk around in my grunts for two days...
Yeah, that's greatatjust don't take too long to finish him off, ok the sooner he's dead, the sooner we can get on the escape.
no games. I'm in.
you're in.
no, no, no.
what's wrong?
we got to call off the fight.
no, that's an impossibility.
no, no, no, you don't understand!
there's got to be more acetone around here.
no, that's it!
I can't go against sammy straight up!
I'm a dead man!
if you don't kill him, we are all dead.
this isn't the best neighborhood.
I've been in a lot worse.
just stick close.
Si.
you want to do this?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
where is the money?
I want to see the product.
money first.
show me the stuff.
el dinero!
lincoln, please, let's get out of here.
tell him to stop wasting my time.
no.
tell him.
Oh, my god!
big?
it's grande?
Si.
ask him how do i trigger it by remote.
boom.
dial one-one, send.
one-one, send?
yeah
Adios.
Adios.
buena suerte.
why didn't you tell me you were gonna buy a bomb?
you never would have come otherwi we need that saw.
you know, uh, I am a fisherman.
I am.
I'm just maybe a little bit more connected than I've let on.
I think this is gonna work.
Yeah.
you know, I run charters, just like I said...
I have for years.
then one day, that brunette, gretchen well, she asked me if I wanted to be exclusive to her corporation, right?
and, uh, well, with the money she was offering,
I had a pretty good idea she wasn't just trawling for salmon.
so you two have history.
Yeah. And she's been an absolute nightmare in my life ever since that first job.
Alex, I need a wedge.
wedge.
look, I took 'em where they wanted me to take 'em.
I have to figure out these coordinates and I have to take them back there.
quit embarrassing yourself.
what?
we're not two chicks at a bar you're trying to pick up.
unless you need to hear this? - No.
all right, good.
you work for the company.
and when you break out of here, you're gonna do whatever the company asks you to do, period.
well, they're using me just like they're using you.
good, I'm glad you shared that with me.
so why don't we go back to work?
how's that sound?
let those idiots chickenfoot themselves all they want, huh?
but if one of them tries to use it on us...
you don't have to fight that guy.
it's my farewell tour.
the rest of those pieces are no good.
we're going to need those tools, michael.
I guess we'll just have to wait.
that book of yours-- it's just a bunch of coordinates in there, right?
among other things.
so you wouldn't mind.
it's just a bunch of, uh, numbers and dates.
gate.
gate netting company.
that's where I rent my trammels.
stampede.
that's my buddy's cape islander.
and this is important to us how?
it's important because I'm being accused of being someone I'm not.
and I don't want scofield ditching me once it's time to leave...
he's not ditching anybody.
if he could have gotten rid of anybody, he would have gotten rid of me.
and if he tries to leave the city he knows that we're gonna turn him in before he gets out of the city.
I'm going upstairs to find lechero and his equipment.
I'm with alex.
do you mind?
sounds like someone's up there.
if lechero gets stranded up there, we're not getting out of here.
so when you think it's safe, or it feels like it's safe, we got to go, we got to go up.
we've been talking about chickenfooting sammy for months.
no one had the courage.
do you have any paint thinner?
paint thinner?
shoe polish, lighter fluid, glue?
there you are, champ.
it's time.
stomp his face, brad!
you know, this has all been one big misunderstanding.
I wasn't talking about sammy.
it was... that's him.
that's the guy I was talking about.
Yeah, I don't see no "fruity moustache," and where's his "ugly-ass vest," brad?
don't worry, you stand a real chance of winning this one.
you cannot just hide out all day.
what else can I do, huh?
I've ruled these men for a year with blood.
you don't think those men want to take the head of the man who wore the crown?
be that as it may, bellick is about to lose his head to sammy.
you may not want to hear this, but once that happens, we are both very much hell you are.
he's going to come crawling out of his hole and right into sammy's arms, and then he and our escape are gone forever.
wait.
we get the tools and we come straight back.
come on
you guys want to watch the fight?
you know, chill out.
I'll get you a beer.
you like that?
stop it.
Scofield!
Scofield's in there.
it's locked.
open the door.
I don't have the combination.
I said... open it now.
we can'T. We can'T.
open it now.
I don't have the combination.
Hey, I've got your man out here.
if you don't open the door, he's the one who's going to pay the price.
I need him alive!
you saw those guys.
what do you think they've got planned?
all of you is trying my patience.
what do you suggest, alex?
let's be ready for them.
time's up.
you want another one?
then you better be persuasive.
don't open the door! He's got a gu...
are you going to tell me what it's for?
no.
because you think I might tell james?
because you don't need to know.
it's going to be all right.
how'd it go? - Good.
I to her what she wanted to hear, just like you told me.
that it?
Yeah.
cool.
listen, I want you to call her up, tell her you've got some information.
make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right?
okay.
is everything okay?
Yeah. Why?
she looks upset.
I'll call you later.
got something down here we can use, michael.
if they come through that door...
you hit 'em right here.
go ahead, take it. Go ahead.
it'll puncture the heart.
you were hiding scofield in your room?
look at you-- the power make you mad already.
come along, norman.
what is so urgent?
Lincoln bought a gun.
I... I asked him what he planned on doing with it, but he wouldn't answer.
so I just... I just thought you might want to know.
if anything changes, I'll get back to you, okay?
you know, the other day when you and lincoln had your little spat in the lobby and you -
all distraught and jilted-- went across the street to the bar, a cynic might think that was staged.
I'm a cynic, sugar.
you're high, sugar.
if it's any comfort, you guys almost pulled it off.
the puerto rican and the gorilla-- you really had me scrambling there for a minute.
Hey, if you don't want my help, fine, I'm out, okay?
it's a little thing called a tracing number-- on the check I gave you.
apparently your extensive expertise in banking failed you that day.
you promptly wired all 25 k to maricruz delgado in chicago at 123
please don't hurt me lane.
I swear to god, if something happens to her... - if what?!
what, jackass?!
you're going to go back there and you're going to get me some real information, or maricruz and her head are going to part ways.
get out of my car.
now.
Hey, blanco.
I got your good buddy lechero here.
why don't you give it the secret knock so he know's you, huh?
the combination.
what makes you think I have the combination?
just do what he says.
how many times you gonna pull that little thing out?
as many times as I feel necessary.
what, you think it make you look strong?
all it does is magnify your weakness.
funny, I'm feeling pretty secure right about now.
now, the combination, old man.
we're not asking again.
I'm opening the door.
Michael, do not open the...
drop 'em!
drop them, I said!
now move!
you're escaping with him?
I was gonna tell you all about this, bredda.
it just never came up, eh?
take it. It's yours.
the tunnel, the escape plan, everything.
we can go together.
I'm taking everything you got.
but you ain't going nowhere.
how you finishing up this hole?
promise me you'll take whistler with you.
you making demands on me? Huh?
I understand...
why you're going to kill me, but he's done nothing wrong.
I'll tell you everything you need to know, just take him with you.
you need him.
he's the only one who figured this one out.
don't you worry, I'll take care of your friend.
all right.
first, you need to keep building braces to support the tunnel as you go.
how you do that?
Whistler can show you how.
look like you just make some wood squares from these boxes here.
like I said, whistler can show you.
how much further to the surface?
not far.
can't be more than ten feet.
impressive, blanco.
too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.
how long is this going to set us back?
what's gonna set us back is if the tower guards are looking at a giant sinkhole out in no man's land.
we're good. - Yeah.
we're good.
back in business.
I'm in.
for what, getting your ass kicked?
I'm in or I shout it from the rooftops.
you're in, champ.
okay, you need to stay here.
I got to get something, all right?
don't move.
can you get home from here?
Yeah, I'm two blocks away.
if he doesn't take you, I will.
here. Use this.
Thanks. - Right there.
you know, for all the times you wanted me to prove I was a fisherman,
I should have been asking if you were a real engineer.
that could've been one of us buried down there.
I'll do better next time.
I'm gonna go back down and try to salvage some of those braces.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
never gets any easier.
Scofield, visita.
Scofield, visita.
all the side jobs I do at sona for three years.
I save all of my money.
it's $173.
if you're really leaving, it's yours.
take me with you. Please?
I don't want to be here anymore.
you don't want any part of this.
you got a plan or are we back to square one?
I have a plan.
good,'cause I got something cooking on the outside.
I ain't walking into a buzzsaw again.
how you dealing with the animals in here?
actually, it's starting to feel like home.
Whistler still pretending he's a fisherman and all this?
Why?
Sofia found a passport in one of the apartments he kept.
name's gary miller.
I'm shocked.
guy's a fraud, michael.
as far as I know, there ain't fish in scottsdale.
well, if he's not a fisherman...
what is he?
the bracing is going to be tricky.
unless the tunnel gets the proper support, it's all going to come down on our heads.
listen, I want you to call her up, tell her you've got some information.
make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right?
Lincoln bought a gun.
just thought you'd want to know.
if you're really leaving, take me with you. Please?
I don't want to be here anymore.
you don't want any part of this.
there's a part of me that doesn't want to believe he works for them 'cause he's the man I loved, the man who was going to take me to Paris.
if he doesn't take you, I will.
too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.
how long is this going to set us back?
all right. We got 24 hours to dig out that tunnel.
you mean the one it took you guys three days to dig the first time?
let's just say, by some miracle, we are able to part the dirt sea, moses.
then what?
how you plan on getting around the Guards' tower?
Michael, Mr. Whistler here says that, you know, you got stopped last time by a cloud.
I'm still working on that.
I'd like to know if this girl's gonna put out before I spend any more time buying her drinks!
I agree, Michael.
you know as well as I do what's riding on this.
I'd say I know better.
I don't care who knows what so long as somebody knows how the hell we getting out of here by tomorrow.
you coming?
not today.
James and I have a lot of things to clear up, but I'm done trying to do it through a fence.
you ever wish you could go back in time?
just to remember how it was like when things made sense?
every day for the last three years.
is that Whistler's girlfriend?
why is she staying in the car?
guess she thinks she'll see him tomorrow.
you've been spending a lot of time together, huh?
And?
you sure that's wise?
where are we?
behind schedule.
but we should be on the same side of the fence by tomorrow afternoon.
what do you mean,"should"?
the tunnel gets us into no-man's-land.
to get to the fence, we're going to need a new diversion of the tower guards.
what time?
daytime's still our best option.
they double the guards at night.
and the jeep patrols? - Yeah.
and, uh...there's something else.
what?
T-Bag's coming. and Mahone. Bellick.
Oh, yeah, there's a drug lord, too.
you know what? It's not about them. It's about Whistler.
we got to do whatever... - You don't need to know who Whistler is.
what about what he's worth?
my son's life.
I just wish there was another way to do this.
to save Lj without handing Whistler over.
look, man, that's it. There isn't.
I know.
listen, you worry about the tunnel, I worry about the guards.
see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow.
Hey, now, don't skimp on the braces up there.
in fact, if you want to add a little extra, just...
you know, we can work on this railroad all...the livelong day, but it don't matter if Scofield doesn't know what happens once we get off the train.
once we get out of here, it's every man for himself.
Scofield's not responsible for any of us.
is that so?
you obviously don't know him very well, Shakespeare.
when we broke out of Fox River, he tried to screw every one of us.
half the men ended up either dead, captured or worse.
the guys who are easiest to catch are the one's who spend more time pissing and moaning at each other than running.
my only advice to you, Ecclesiastes 6: 13.
separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
how we doing, Alex?
well, if those braces hold, we could be to the surface sometime tomorrow.
let's rotate.
keep everybody fresh.
welcome to the coal mine, canary.
don't drop your body-water upon me like that!
Hey, it ain't coming from me, I swear.
engineer, come. Look at this.
we hit a pipe or something? - Oh, no.
that's right above our tunnel.
that's not going to hold till tomorrow.
so what do we do?
we leave tonight.
tonight?
I thought you said a nighttime escape was impossible.
so up, the tunnel will collapse again, and that'll be the end of it.
it'll be the end for you.
you're the one on a deadline.
what if it gives out while we're inside?
we end up like buried treasure. - You want out, get out!
look, you're not pulling this off tonight without all of us working around the clock.
and none of us are ever making it out of here without his plan, so if you tell me that you can figure out a way how to do this at night, then I-- we-- can figure out a way how to get that tunnel dug in time.
let's start digging.
I think you dropped something.
I've read in old newspapers that make it to Sona how americans hold others to standards they ignore.
how they think no one should have power but them.
I tell everyone it's a lie, but I see it's true.
Aving.
and I think that after everything I've done to help,
I think it sucks you're not taking me with you!
I know it doesn't seem like it now, but I'm doing you a favor.
I'm giving you a gift.
Oh, wow, life in prison. Thank you.
I've always wanted one of those.
it's better than a life on the run.
I don't belong here.
all I did was give a guy... - you're not going!
I'm sorry.
it's for the best.
how do you know what's best for me?
it's good to go.
you know where and when to be, right?
if you're not there, we're screwed.
you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just going to grab my stuff. - Yeah.
probably best if you and James disappear.
I know. I know.
you know where to meet us, right?
you'll be on the...
we'll see you tomorrow then.
good luck.
you, too.
Hey, it's that susan chick. She wants to meet again.
good.
let her know everything's on track.
we want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.
why shouldn't she be?
she's going to get her guy tomorrow, right?
well, if Michael's conscience doesn't get in the way.
what do you mean?
he's having doubts.
about if he can pull it off?
about if he should.
but he's going to go through with it, right?
what are you looking for?
where the power lines connect to sona's exterior lights.
if cutting the power out there was an option, why didn't we do that in the first place?
one, the power out there isn't controlled from in here.
and, two, there's that.
every prison has a backup generator.
even if we cut the lights, they'll just come back on again immediately.
well, that's a big, bloody problem.
tell Lechero I need his phone.
change of plans, Linc.
we're doing this tonight.
tonight?
what happened, Michael?
rain, dirt, tunnel, problem.
how long can it hold?
that depends.
depends on what?
when the rain stops.
you said breaking out at night was impossible.
Yeah, well...
you want to tell me how you're going to pull this off?
for starters, I need to get a hold of Sucre.
Sucre, do you know what I do for a living?
I have a pretty good idea.
I read people.
and you, my friend, are a coloring book.
I think you left this in my car.
look. That...that was just...I mean...
No,No, no, no, no.
my fault.
I guess I just didn't make myself clear when I laid out the terms of our arrangement.
so I'm going to try again as simply as I know how.
anything happens-- anything at all I wasn't expecting
and there will be one less pregnant girl in Chicago.
look, Michael and Lincoln don't tell me everything.
Fernando, this is your last chance.
I want a yes or a no.
are the brothers gonna break Whistler out of Sona?
Yes.
are they planning on handing him over to me?
Yes.
okay!
there's one thing I heard.
it's Michael.
he's, he's having some concerns about Whistler.
what kind of concerns?
about handing him over.
you got to understand, he broke out some pretty bad guys last time.
I think he's never forgiven himself for that.
he's planning on leaving him behind?
maybe. I don't know.
Hello, Lincoln.
it's going down tonight.
tonight?
should I be worried?
I called you first thing.
I'm being straight up with you.
that's refreshing.
so I'll see you tonight.
you show me yours and I'll show you mine.
it's going down tonight.
do you know about that?
I didn't know, I swear.
get out of here.
how'd it go?
she found the bomb, Linc.
the one we put in her car.
how did she find the bomb, Sucre?
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.
it's not your fault.
look, I'll make it up to you, I swear.
you can start now. Michael's in a bit of trouble in Sona.
what kind of trouble?
the rain stopped.
does that mean... - No.
the damage is done.
we can't risk waiting.
anything interesting?
like some coordinates the company might want to get their hands on?
if they didn't want me out of here and your nephew was safe, would you still be doing this?
breaking out?
no.
why would you choose to stay if there was a chance at freedom?
well, I guess that's the difference between us.
I'm waitting to pay for my sins.
and I'm not?
that's a good question.
water's coming down pretty fast up in here, Patron.
Yeah. We have to dig faster.
you know, I've been thinking.
it doesn't have to be every man for himself.
you and I can help each other.
if I need a hand, I'll find someone with a spare.
while it's true I may be lacking something in the west,
I more than make up for it in the north.
think about it.
Scofield's got us down here doing manual labor; slave labor.
I ain't no slave.
I'm doing this for me.
why do you think scofield's up there and we're down here?
he's planning something.
who among us isn't?
what the hell is that?
OK, let's unload here
make the animals walk through the filth
come here
let's go
good. Good! Keep going!
we're good. - Yeah.
we're all right. Okay.
Yeah.
Hello, Lincoln.
long time no see.
not long enough.
I was thinking that we could have a little chat in person.
make sure we're all on the same page about what's gonna happen tonight.
all right.
30 minutes, this location. I'm sending a text. Can't we just...
sorry. What's up?
it's payday
you're first
you need to pick up your check gracias.
see you later.
hello.
Hey, papi, it's me.
Lincoln said you needed some help.
how much do you know about electricity?
Hey, you're back.
I'm not real comfortable being alone down here with those...
what's that?
syrup; honey.
make a little pile of dirt. Gather some dirt.
Scofield said we got to make something to cover the hole once we get out.
so when the lights go back on it's gonna look like nobody ever left.
go ahead. Spread it around.
I was thinking...
we should be a team, you know?
not just during the escape, but after.
like, like Butch and Sundance.
butch and Sundance died.
well, I mean in the other parts.
here's an idea.
we go along with Scofield's plan, and then when everyone stops to take a breath, we grab 'em, Burroughs, Scofield, Bagwell.
we take 'em back home to face charges.
hell, we'd be heroes.
might even get a book deal.
we could write it together, Alex. How'd that be?
a book deal? - Yeah.
gonna make you happy, Brad?
you got a better idea?
Yeah, I do.
something to do with a wife and kid?
Yeah, something like that.
you got room for one more?
come on, Alex.
what's a guy like me gonna do?
let's just let Scofield get us out of here, and then we'll worry about everything else, all right?
all right.
come on. A little more dirt.
listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
you sure you don't want Linc to do this?
he knows more about this than I do.
it's not about what you know.
it's about where you work.
and as a Sona employee, my friend, you have the unique ability of not getting shot for being here.
you see the admin building?
I see it.
go to it and make a left.
to it and left. Got it.
on the other side is a berm.
there should be a metal cage.
that's the backup generator.
okay, I see it.
don't let the tower guard see you get too close.
just act casual.
when I say now, you run and duck behind it.
almost.
hold on.
now!
okay. Okay.
there should be some writing near the bottom.
I need the name of the manufacturer, make and model number, anything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.
it's, uh, it's, uh, prana industrial.
model number 3210.
all right. Thanks.
that's all I need.
you really think you can pull this off tonight?
you want to know the truth?
no, I just want all of it go down smooth.
for everyone to get what they want.
Yeah, I do.
listen, even if you get this worked out with the lights, what are you gonna do about the jeep patrols?
we're just gonna have to take our chances.
maybe you don't.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Where's Lj?
somewhere safe.
take a load off.
can I offer you a drink?
what's going on, Susan?
I just wanted to get everyone together so we can discuss tonight's agenda.
maybe nail down a few guidelines.
it's the same as before, nothing has changed.
actually, I was thinking we should probably include all the players.
don't you?
what are you doing in here?
just keeping watch.
make sure nobody tries to get down to the tunnel.
who are you calling?
Yeah, hi. Is this, uh, customer service?
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm a sub working, building down here in Panama, and, um, we got a client on-site.
they're asking questions about the 3210 generator we're installing.
Yeah. Exactly.
anyway, they want to know, if the main power shuts down, how long are they gonna be in the dark, um, before the generator kicks in?
Yeah. Thanks. I'll hold.
you're a very good liar.
that's the timing?
no, that's, uh... that's it.
appreciate it.
well? We gonna make it?
we should have just enough dark to make it out.
with everyone?
you with Whistler?
Yes.
Susan has got a message.
Why?
put him on.
it's for you.
yes?
all right, I got him. What now?
tell him I want him to listen very carefully to the following instructions.
she wants you to listen real care... - I can hear.
instructions about what?
was that Sofia?
is she there?
Yeah.
what's going on?
he wants to know what this is about.
all right. I'll tell him.
No!
was... was that just...
is that Sofia?
is that Sofia?
have you figured out the coordinates yet, James?
please.
almost.
wrong answer.
No! - No!
I'll get them for you when we get out of here, I swear.
all your promises, your guarantees-- they mean nothing.
I'm pretty sick of waiting around for you boys to screw me over.
I want those coordinates by the end of the day.
we gotta figure this out.
gotta do something.
gotta do something.
we both know that you can't just hand over that information.
Why?
why can't I?
once they get what they want, they'll have no reason to keep you or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.
so what do I do?
I, I just, I just let them torture Sofia?
we'll work something out.
we'll think it through.
I already have.
what is so special about him anyway, huh?
you think he has anything to do with why them people wanted Scofield down here in the first place?
it's really none of my business.
what exactly is your business, Alex?
something on your mind?
I'm just saying...
if we needed a bargaining chip,
do you think a sharp stick in that dull limey would help us out?
there is no "us.
you and me are a lot more alike than you think, Alex.
we both know how it feels to lose a great love.
how it feels to kill a man.
and we both ended up in here because of Michael Scofield.
wouldn't it be poetic justice if we could just return the favor?
justice, huh?
if there was an ounce of it left in this world...
you'd be lying face down in the same unmarked grave as the rest of your inbred family.
the only difference between me and you, Alex, is a badge, and the last time I checked, you didn't even have that, so you can just keep on hoping for your happy endings, Alex, you just keep on plowing ahead with them blinders on, you know, but the thing about them blinders is...
it makes it really hard to watch you back.
it's gonna be better soon, I promise.
he's right, you know.
if James loves you the way he says he does, he'll give us what we want, and then you and your white knight can ride off into the sunset.
unless you're already with him.
you scared, Susan?
do I look scared, Lincoln?
to pull something like this...
you desperate?
you need to stop fighting with me.
if you really understood what was going on, you would know that we're not the bad guys.
could've fooled me.
haven't you ever done the wrthings for the right reason?
what are the right reasons, Susan?
what is it about Whistler that's so important.
I could tell you.
but then I'd have to kill you.
you're gonna do that anyway.
Whistler gives us what we want, maybe I won't have to.
Lincoln called.
they're on their way.
I figured them out.
the coordinates.
I'm gonna hand them over.
I thought you should know so you can take whatever precautions you can.
what if, uh...
what if you give them the wrong coordinates.
it might buy us some more time.
maybe lincoln can get Sofia to safety.
like he did with Sara?
I'm sorry. I...
I didn't mean to. I, uh...
I just don't know what else to do.
I'm damned if I do. I'm damned if I don't.
there's no way to win.
it's not about winning anymore.
it's about surviving-- which is not the same as giving up.
but you can go gracefully.
there's honor.
protecting the ones you love.
honor's a luxury men like us can't afford.
can you promise me we'll make it out of here tonight?
no games.
can you honestly promise me?
I can promise you I'll do everything in my power.
I wish that were good enough.
if you do this...
if you give them what they want...
everything that's been lost will have been for nothing.
what's up?
take it easy.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Officer Monjares, plesae
hey Arturo. phone for you!
can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm kind of in a hurry
I got some place to be
what's that?
friends of mine are moving tonight
and they need my help
tell them you're gonna be late
let's go
walk Linc, he's gonna...
he's gonna give it to them.
relax.
I'll see you in a minute.
what are you talking about?
all clear.
I suppose introductions are unnecessary at this point.
what are we doing here, Gretchen?
we're here to say good-bye.
I promise you, sweetheart, they're not going to hurt you anymore.
do you have the coordinates, James?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I tried to run away... - this is not your fault.
it's mine.
when I took this job, I knew they weren't good people.
I just didn't know how bad they were.
and everything that's happened...
it's all because of me.
and for that I'm truly sorry.
the coordinates.
just pass them through.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm buying some goodwill.
you're buying her funeral.
you know I have what you need.
and I'll give you the rest.
but only after I know that Sofia, that Lj, and that these men here...
they're all safe.
do you understand me?
everything's gonna be all right.
I'm impressed.
it seems our fisherman grew himself a set of oysters.
can you really trust these men with her life?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe I can.
all right, James.
but there's been some confusion about the timing of things-- last-minute changes, et cetera.
I'm gonna make this clear for everyone involved.
if time runs out and I don't have the second half of those coordinates, Lj and the senorita stop breathing.
say good-bye, sweetheart.
don't be stupid, lincoln.
I've helped you.
now you help me.
please.
just get us out of here.
bout the timing on the backup generator? - Yeah.
all we got to do now is cut the power to the exterior lights.
how are you gonna do that?
I'm not-- it can't be accessed from the inside.
how much time have I got?
let's say, uh, 5:15 tomorrow morning.
that should give us enough time to dig out the tunnel before the sun comes up.
all right. What about Whistler?
what about him?
well, he manned up-- he could've handed over the information, but he didn't.
still concerned about handing him over?
I've got my concerns about pretty much everybody, Linc.
you know what I mean? - Yeah.
mostly, I'm just tired.
tired of choices...
consequences.
I just want this to be over... tonight.
let's do it.
when you're on the run, you're always looking over your shoulder, listening for the sirens, wondering if that pretty girl across the street is staring at you because she wants you, or...
because you're wanted.
you change your name, the way you look...
and leave everything you ever knew behind.
and the ones you love, they're the ones who have to pay.
that's what's waiting for you on the outside.
that's why I couldn't bring you on.
because nothing good can come of this.
can anything good come from staying in?
it has to be your decision. I...
I cannot be responsible for you.
you won't have to be.
does your father still have that phone number I gave you?
I think so.
well, tell him to call my brother if he wants to find out where to pick you up tomorrow.
does that mean...
it means if a million things fall into place...
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.
don't let anyone see you with that phone.
I think we did it, Michael.
I believe we're ready.
she's a little wet, but she's ready.
makes me think of the first thing I'll do when we're gonna get out.
just, does anybody know what's spanish for "don't shoot"?
no dispare.
no dis what?
just relax. Nobody's gonna get shot.
just don't panic.
as soon as Linc cuts the power, we go.
what about the jeep patrol?
taken care of.
what about the backup generator?
backup generator?
nobody said anything about...
there's a lag from when the power cuts out to when the generator kicks back in.
well, how long a lag are we talking about here?
30 seconds.
you expect us to run in 30 seconds?
as soon as the lights go out, I'm gone.
with or without you.
please, my friends
they're expecting me and
I have some bad news, Jorge
we won't be able to pay you today
that's fine, I-I can wait until
when we ran your identification through processing...
we found a slight problem
What.kind of a problem
you have a warrant out for your arrest now.
let's go.
off the bus! Now!
as soon as the lights go out, we got to be ready to move.
you want to tell us what the hell the taquito's doing down here?
he's coming with us.
I don't think so.
that's not up to you.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
see, we made up our own decision here.
well, with the time frame being so short and all, we'd feel a whole lot better about things if we go first.
what are you gonna do, kill me?
T-bag: No, no.
see, if we ain't first, he's not - All right! All right! Just...
look, I think I can explain all this
if I could just get some paperwork from my car
you're not going anywhere
understand?
all right.
all right, go. Just go.
just go.
every man for himself, right?
you want to move up in line, too?
no, I think I'm gonna stay back here.
I just don't want to turn my back on anybody.
daytime's still our best option.
they double the guards at night.
and the jeep patrols?
Yeah. and, uh... there's something else.
what?
T-Bag's coming. and Mahone.
Bellick. oh, yeah, there's a drug lord, too.
you know what? it's not about them.
it's about Whistler. we got to do whatever...
you don't need to know who Whistler is.
what about what he's worth? My son's life.
I just wish there was another way to do this.
to save LJ without handing Whistler over.
look, man, that's it. There isn't.
I know.
listen, you worry about the tunnel,
I worry about the guards.
see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow.
Hey, now, don't skimp on the braces up there.
in fact, if you want to add a little extra, just...
you know, we can work on this railroad all the livelong day,
but it don't matter.
if Scofield doesn't know what happens
once we get off the train. once we get out of here,
it's every man for himself.
Scofield's not responsible for any of us.
is that so?
you obviously don't know him very well,
Shakespeare.
when we broke out of Fox River,
he tried to screw every one of us.
half the men ended up either
dead, captured or worse.
the guys who are easiest to catch
are the one's who spend more time
pissing and moaning at each other than running.
my only advice to you,
Ecclesiastes 6: 13.
separate thyself from thy enemies,
and take heed of thy friends.
how we doing, Alex?
well, if those braces hold,
we could be to the surface
sometime tomorrow.
let's rotate. Keep everybody fresh.
welcome to the coal mine, canary.
don't drop your body-water upon me like that!
Hey, it ain't coming from me, I swear.
engineer, come.
look at this.
we hit a pipe or something?
Oh, no.
that's right above our tunnel.
that's not going to hold till tomorrow.
so what do we do?
we leave tonight.
tonight?
I thought you said a nighttime escape was impossible.
if the rain keeps up, the tunnel will collapse again,
and that'll be the end of it.
it'll be the end for you.
you're the one on a deadline.
what if it gives out whilwe're inside?
we end up like buried treasure.
you want out, get out!
look, you're not pulling this off tonight
without all of us working around the clock.
and none of us
are ever making it out of here
without his plan, so if you tell me
that you can figure out a way how to do this at night,
then i-- we-- can figure out a way
how to get that tunnel dug in time.
let's start digging.
I think you dropped something.
I've read in old newspapers that make it to Sona
how Americans hold others to standards they ignore.
how they think no one should have power but them.
I tell everyone it's a lie, but I see it's true.
I know you're leaving.
and I think that after everything I've done to help,
I think it sucks you're not taking me with you!
I know it doesn't seem like it now,
but I'm doing you a favor. I'm giving you a gift.
Oh, wow, life in prison.
thank you. I've always wanted one of those.
it's better than a life on the run.
I don't belong here. all I did was give a guy...
you're not going!
I'm sorry.
it's for the best.
how do you know what's best for me?
y cuanto me va costar?
okay, muchas gracias.
it's good to go.
you know where and when to be, right?
if you're not there, we're screwed.
you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just going to grab my stuff.
Yeah, probably best if you and James disappear.
I know. I know.
you know where to meet us, right?
playa blanca. you'll be on the...
3-12. we'll see you tomorrow then.
good luck.
you, too.
Hey, it's that Susan chick.
she wants to meet again.
good.
let her know everything's on track.
we want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.
why shouldn't she be?
she's going to get her guy tomorrow, right?
well, if Michael's conscience doesn't get in the way.
what do you mean?
he's having doubts.
about if he can pull it off?
about if he should.
but he's going to go through with it, right?
what are you looking for?
where the power lines connect to Sona's exterior lights.
if cutting the power out there was an option,
why didn't we do that in the first place?
one, the power out there isn't controlled from in here.
and, two, there's that.
every prison has a backup generator.
even if we cut the lights, they'll just come back on again
immediately.
well, that's a big, bloody problem.
tell Lechero I need his phone.
change of plans, Linc.
we're doing this tonight.
tonight? what happened, Michael?
rain, dirt, tunnel, problem.
depends on what?
when the rain stops.
you said breaking out at night was impossible.
Yeah, well...
you want to tell me how you're going to pull this off?
for starters, I need to get a hold of Sucre.
Sucre, do you know what I do for a living?
I have a pretty good idea.
I read people.
and you, my friend, are a coloring book.
I think you left this in my car.
look. that... that was just... I mean...
no. no, no, no, no.
my fault.
I guess I just didn't make myself clear.
when I laid out the terms of our arrangement.
so I'm going to try again as simply as I know how.
anything happens
anything at all that I wasn't expecting
and there will be one less
pregnant girl in Chicago.
look, Michael and Lincoln don't tell me everything.
Fernando, this is your last chance.
I want a yes or a no.
are the brothers gonna break Whistler out of Sona?
Yes.
are they planning on handing him over to me?
Yes.
where do you want me to shoot Maricruz first,
in the bun or in the oven?
okay!
there's one thing I heard.
it's Michael. he's, he's having some concerns about Whistler.
what kind of concerns?
about handing him over.
you got to understand,
he broke out some pretty bad guys last time.
I think he's never forgiven himself for that.
he's planning on leaving him behind?
maybe. I don't know.
Shh.
Hello, Lincoln.
it's going down tonight.
tonight?
should I be worried?
I called you first thing.
I'm being straight up with you.
that's refreshing.
so I'll see you tonight.
you show me yours and I'll show you mine.
It'soing down tonight.
do you know about that?
I didn't know, I swear.
get out of here.
how'd it go?
she found the bomb, Linc.
the one we put in her car.
how did she find the bomb, Sucre?
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.
it's not your fault.
look, I'llak mit
up to you, I swear.
you can start now.
Michael's in a bit of trouble in Sona.
what kind of trouble?
the rain stopped. Does that mean...?
no. the damage is done.
we can't risk waiting.
anything interesting?
like some coordinates the company might want to get their hands on?
if they didn't want me out of here
and yourephew was safe, would you still be doing this?
breaking out?
no.
why would you choose to stay if there was a chance at freedom?
well, I guess that's the difference between us.
I'm willing to pay for my sins.
and I'm not?
that's a good question.
water's coming down pretty fast up in here, patron.
Yeah. we hav to dig faster.
you know, I've been thinking.
it doesn't have to be every man for himself.
you and I can help each other.
if I need a hand, I'll find someone with a spare.
while it's true I may be lacking
something in the west,
I more than make up for it in the north.
think about it.
Scofield's got us down here doing manual labor, slave labor.
I ain't no slave.
I'm doing this for me.
why do you think Scofield's up there
and we'rdoe here?
he's planning something.
who among us isn't?
what the hell is that?
Yeah.
Hello, Lincoln. Long time no see.
not long enough.
I was thinking that we could
have a little chat in person.
make sure we're all on the same page
about what's gonna happen tonight.
all right.
30 minutes, this location. I'm sending a text.
hello. - Hey, papi, it's me.
Hey.
Lincoln said you needed some help.
how much do you know about electricity?
Hey, you're back.
I'm not real comfortable being alone down here with those...
what's that?
syrup, honey. Make a little pile of dirt.
gather some dirt.
Scofield said we got to make something
to cover the hole once we get out.
so when the lights go back on
it's gonna look like nobody ever left.
go ahead. Spread it around.
I was thinking...
we should be a team, you know?
not just during the escape, but after.
like, like Butch and Sundance.
butch and sundance died.
well, I mean in the other parts.
here's an idea.
we go along with Scofield's plan,
and then when everyone stops to take a breath,
we grab 'em.
Burroughs, Scofield, Bagwell.
we take 'em back home to face charges.
hell, we'd be heroes.
might even get a book deal.
we could write it together, Alex.
how'd that be? a book deal?
Yeah.
gonna make you happy, Brad?
you got a better idea?
Yeah, I do.
something to do with a wife and kid?
Yeah, something like that.
you got room for one more?
come on, Alex.
what's a guy like me gonna do?
let's just let Scofield get us out of here,
and then we'll worry about everything else, all right?
all right.
come on. a little more dirt.
listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
you sure you don't want Linc to do this?
he knows more about this than I do.
it's not about what you know.
it's about where you work.
and as a Sona employee, my friend,
you have the unique ability of not getting shot
for being here.
you see the admin building?
I see it.
go to it and make a left.
to it and left. got it.
on the other side is a berm.
there should be a metal cage.
that's the backup generator.
okay, I see it.
don't let the tower guard see you get too close.
just act casual.
when I say now,
you run and duck behind it.
almost.
hold on.
now!
okay.
okay. there should be
some writing near the bottom.
I need the name of the manufacturer,
make and model number, anything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got it, I got it.
it's, uh, it's, uh, Prana Industrial.
model number 3210.
3210. is there a customer service number?
all right. thanks. that's all I need.
you really think you can pull this off tonight?
you want to know the truth?
no, I just want all of it go down smooth.
for everyone to get what they want.
Yeah, I do.
listen, even if you get this worked out with the lights,
what are you gonna do about the jeep patrols?
we're just gonna have to take our chances.
maybe you don't.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Where's LJ?
somewhere safe. Take a load off.
can I offer you a drink?
what's going on, Susan?
I just wanted to get everyone together
so we can discuss tonight's agenda.
maybe nail down a few guidelines.
it's the same as before, nothing has changed.
actually, I was thinking
we should probably include all the players.
don't you?
what are you doing in here?
just keeping watch.
make sure nobody tries to get down to the tunnel.
who are you calling?
Yeah, hi. is this, uh, customer service?
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm a sub working, building down here in Panama,
and, um, we got a clntien-site.
they're asking questions
about the 3210 generator we're installing.
Yeah. exactly. um...
anyway, they want to know, if the main power shuts down,
how long are they gonna be in the dark,
um, before the generator kicks in?
Yeah. thanks.
I'll hold.
you're a very good liar.
that's the timing?
no, that's, uh...
that's it.
appreciate it.
well?
we gonna make it
we should have
just enough dark to make it out.
with everyone?
you with Whistler?
Yes.
Susan has got a message.
Why? Put him on.
it's for you.
yes?
all right, I got him. What now?
tell him I want him to listen
very carefully to the following instructions.
she wants you to listen real care...
I can hear.
instructions about what?
James?
was that Sofia? Is she there?
Yeah.
what's going on?
he wants to know what this is about.
all right.
I'll tell him.
No!
was... was that just...
is that Sofia?
is that Sofia?!
have you figured out
the coordinates yet, James?
please.
almost.
wrong answer.
No!
I'll get them for you when we get out
of here, I swear.
all your promises, your guarantees
they mean nothing.
I'm pretty sick of waiting around for you boys
to screw me over.
I want those coordinates by the end of the day.
gotta do something.
gotta do something.
we both know that you can't just hand over that information.
Why? Why can't I?
once they get what they want,
they'll have no reason to keep you
or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.
so what do I do?
I, I just,
I just let them torture Sofia?
we'll work something out.
we'll think it through.
I already have.
Whistler...
Whistler. what is so special about him anyway, huh?
you think he has anything to do with why them people
wanted Scofield down here in the first place?
it's really none of my business.
what exactly is your business, Alex?
something on your mind?
I'm just saying...
if we needed a bargaining chip,
do you think...
a sharp stick in that dull limey would help us out?
there is no "us.
you and me are a lot more
alike than you think, Alex.
we both know how it feels
to lose a great love.
how it feels to kill a man.
and we both ended up in here because of Michael Scofield.
wouldn't it be poetic justice if we could just...
return the favor?
justice, huh?
if there was an ounce of it left in this world...
you'd be lying face down in the same unmarked grave
as the rest of our inbred family.
the only difference between me and you, Alex, is a badge,
and the last time I checked, you didn't even have that,
so you can just keep on hoping for your happy endings, Alex,
you just keep on plowing ahead with them blinders on,
you know, but the thing about them blinders is...
it makes it really hard to watch your back.
it's gonna be better soon, I promise.
he's right, you know. If James loves you the way he says he does,
he'll give us what we want,
and then you and your white knight
can ride off into the sunset.
unless you're already with him.
you scared, Susan?
do I look scared, Lincoln?
to pull something like this...
you desperate?
you need to stop fighting with me.
if you really understood
what was going on, you would know that
we're not the bad guys.
could've fooled me.
haven't you ever done
the wrong things for the right reason?
what are the right reasons, Susan?
what is it about Whistler that's so important.
I could tell you.
but then I'd have to kill you.
you're gonna do that anyway.
Whistler gives us what we want,
maybe I won't have to.
Linc called.
they're on their way.
I figured them out.
the coordinates.
I'm gonna hand them over.
I thought you should know
so you can take whatever precautions you can.
what if, uh...
what if you give them the wrong coordinates.
it might buy us some more time.
maybe Linc can get Sofia to safety.
like he did with Sara?
I'm sorry. i...
I didn't mean to.
I, uh...
I just don't know what else to do.
I'm damned if I do.
I'm damned if I don't.
there's way to win.
it's not about winning anymore.
it's about surviving
which is not the same
as giving up.
but you can go gracefully.
there's honor.
protecting the ones you love.
honor's a luxury men like us can't afford.
can you promise me we' llmake it out of here tonight?
no games.
can you honestly promise me?
I can promise you I'll do everything in my power.
I wish that were good enough.
if you do this...
if you give them what they want...
everything that's been lost
he's gonna give it to them.
relax. I'll see you in a minute.
what are you talking about?
I suppose
introductions are unnecessary at this point.
what are we doing here, Gretchen?
we're here to say good-bye.
I promise you, sweetheart,
they're not going to hurt you anymore.
do you have the coordinates, James?
Yes. - I'm sorry.
I tried to run away...
this is not your fault.
it's mine.
when took this job,
I knew they weren't good people.
I just didn't know how bad they were.
and everything that's happened...
it's all because of me.
and for that I'm truly sorry.
the coordinates.
just pass them through.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm buying some goodwill.
you're buying her funeral.
you know I have
what you need.
but only after I know
that Sofia, that LJ,
and that these men here...
...they're all safe.
do you understand me?
James...
everything's gonna be all right.
I'm impressed.
can you really trust these men
with her life?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe I can.
all right, James.
but there's been some confusion
about the timing of things-- last-minute changes,
et cetera.
I'm gonna make this clear for everyone involved.
if time runs out and I don't have
the second half of those coordinates,
LJ and the senorita
stop breathing.
say good-bye, sweetheart.
Lincoln! Linc...
don't be stupid, Lincoln.
I've helped you.
now you help me.
please.
you sure about t timing on the backup generator?
Yeah. all we got to do now
is cut the power to the exterior lights.
how are you gonna do that?
I'm not-- it can't be accessed from the inside.
how much time have I got?
let's say, uh, 5: 15 tomorrow morning.
that should give us enough time
to dig out the tunnel before the sun comes up.
all right. what about Whistler? - what about him?
well, he manned up-- he could've handed over
the information, but he didn't.
still concerned about handing him over?
I've got my concerns about pretty much everybody, Linc.
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
mostly, I'm just tired.
tired of choices...
consequences.
I just want this to be over... tonight.
let's do it.
when you're on the run,
you're always looking over your shoulder,
Listinenfor the sirens,
wondering if that
pretty girl across the street is staring at you
because she wants you,
or... because you're wanted.
you change your name,
the way you look...
and leave everything you ever knew behind.
and the ones you love,
they're the ones who have to pay.
that's what's waiting for you on the outside.
that's why I couldn't bring you on.
because nothing good can come of this.
can anything good come from staying in?
it has to be your decision.
I...
I cannot be responsible for you.
you won't have to be.
does your father still have that phone number I gave you?
I think so.
well, tell him to call my brother
if he wants to find out where to pick you up tomorrow.
does that mean...
it means if a million things fall into place...
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.
don't let anyone see you with that phone.
I think we did it, Michael.
I believe we're ready.
she's a little wet, but she's ready.
makes me think of the first thing
I'll do when we're gonna get out.
just, does anybody know what's spanish for "don't shoot"?
no disparen.
no dis what?
just relax. Nobody's gonna get shot.
just don't panic.
as soon as Linc cuts the power, we go.
what about the jeep patrol?
taken care of.
what about the backup generator?
backup generator?
nobody said anything about...
there's a lag from when the power
cuts out to when the nerator kicks back in.
well, how long a lag are we talking about here?
30 seconds.
you expect us to run in 30 seconds?
as soon as the lights go out, I'm gone.
with or without you.
now.
let's go.
off the bus! now!
as soon as the lights go out, we got to be ready to move.
you want to tell us what the hell the taquito's doing down here?
he's coming with us. - I don't think so.
that's not up to you.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
see, we made up our own decision here.
well, with the time frame
being so short and all,
we'd feel a whole lot better about things if we go first.
what are you gonna do, kill me?
no, no. See, if we ain't first,
he's not going at all! all right.
all right! just...
all right.
all right, go. just go.
just go.
every man for himself, right?
you want to move up in line, too?
no, I think I'm gonna stay back.
I just don't want to turn my back on anybody.
30 seconds.
go.
brace gonna be tricky
must get the tunnel properly supported or it will come down to our heads.
Susan will call you for information
make sure she picked you up, and get in the car , all right?
eager to call you up
just thought what you want to know
if you really leaving,
take me with you, please. I dont want to be here anymore.
you dont want to get inpart with this.
there is a part of me that I dont believe he doesnt work with them.
cause he is the man I love.
the man is going to take me to my first trip to Paris.
if he doesnt take you, I will.
impressive blanco, enjoy it.
now we can settle this back
all right, we got 24 hours to dig that tunnel
you mean you want to take our guys three days to dig it first time.
let's just say by some America
we are able to park the dirt, then what?
have plans to get rid of guards tower?
michael Mr. Whistler here says
you know you got stop less time by clock
I am still working on that
I like to know this girl could put up with spend any more time and buy us some drinks.
I agreed Michael. You know we are all out of energy.
I just say there is no better.
how could we get out of this hell everyone gonna fall apart
you come?
not today.
James and I got a lot things to clean up
but I dont trying to do with
you ever wish that you could back time?
just remember how I was things make sense
everyday for last three years.
is that Whistler's girlfriend?
why she's staying in the car?
cause she think she will see you tomorrow.
it's expecting we have time you getting on
And?
you sure that was?
where are we?
behind schedule, we should be on the same side by tomorrow afternoon.
what do you mean should?
the tunnel get us into no mans land, but it get the fence, we're going need new diversion for the tower guards.
what time?
drop what?
that depends
OK, let's unload it here.
make the animals walk through the filth
come here.
let's go.
good. Good! Keep going!
we're good.
we are all right.
sorry. What's up?
it's payday.
you're first
you need to pick up your check.
ah si si glacia
see you later.
No!
gotta figure it out.
what's up?
take it easy, okay, no problem, yes, I'd like to speak to Officer Monjares, please. Hey Arturo, phone for you. - Can I talk to you for a minutes?
I'm kind of hurry.
I got some place to be. - Where's that?
friends of mine are moving tonight and they need my help. - Tell them you're gonna be late.
let's go walk
whistler, you have a visitor. Whisler, you have a visitor.
michael Scofield, you have a visitor.
michael Scofield, you have a visitor and then I'll give you the rest.
just get us out of here.
please, my friends.
they're expecting me
I have some bad news, Jorge
we won't be able to pay you today.
that's fine. I- I can wait.
when we ran your identification through processing...
we found a slight problem
What...kind of a problem?
you have warrant out for your arrest.
get off the bus!
the bracing is going to be tricky.
unless the tunnel gets the proper support, it's all going to come down on our heads.
listen, I want you to call her up, tell her you've got some information.
make sure she picks you up, and get in the car, all right?
Lincoln bought a gun.
just thought you'd want to know.
if you're really leaving, take me with you. Please?
I don't want to be here anymore.
you don't want any part of this.
there's a part of me that doesn't want to believe he works for them 'cause he's the man I loved, the man who was going to take me to Paris.
if he doesn't take you, I will.
too bad you won't be around to enjoy it.
how long is this going to set us back?
all right. We got 24 hours to dig out that tunnel.
you mean the one it took you guys three days to dig the first time?
let's just say, by some miracle, we are able to part the dirt sea, moses.
then what?
how you plan on getting around the Guards' tower?
Michael, Mr. Whistler here says that, you know, you got stopped last time by a cloud.
I'm still working on that.
I'd like to know if this girl's gonna put out before I spend any more time buying her drinks!
I agree, Michael.
you know as well as I do what's riding on this.
I'd say I know better.
I don't care who knows what so long as somebody knows how the hell we getting out of here by tomorrow.
you coming?
not today.
James and I have a lot of things to clear up, but I'm done trying to do it through a fence.
you ever wish you could go back in time?
just to remember how it was like when things made sense?
every day for the last three years.
is that Whistler's girlfriend?
why is she staying in the car?
guess she thinks she'll see him tomorrow.
you've been spending a lot of time together, huh?
And?
you sure that's wise?
where are we?
behind schedule.
but we should be on the same side of the fence by tomorrow afternoon.
what do you mean,"should"?
the tunnel gets us into no-man's-land.
to get to the fence, we're going to need a new diversion of the tower guards.
what time?
daytime's still our best option.
they double the guards at night.
and the jeep patrols? - Yeah.
and, uh...there's something else.
what?
T-Bag's coming. and Mahone. Bellick.
Oh, yeah, there's a drug lord, too.
you know what? It's not about them. It's about Whistler.
we got to do whatever... - You don't need to know who Whistler is.
what about what he's worth?
my son's life.
I just wish there was another way to do this.
to save Lj without handing Whistler over.
look, man, that's it. There isn't.
I know.
listen, you worry about the tunnel, I worry about the guards.
see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow.
Hey, now, don't skimp on the braces up there.
in fact, if you want to add a little extra, just...
you know, we can work on this railroad all...the livelong day, but it don't matter if Scofield doesn't know what happens once we get off the train.
once we get out of here, it's every man for himself.
Scofield's not responsible for any of us.
is that so?
you obviously don't know him very well, Shakespeare.
when we broke out of Fox River, he tried to screw every one of us.
half the men ended up either dead, captured or worse.
the guys who are easiest to catch are the one's who spend more time pissing and moaning at each other than running.
my only advice to you, Ecclesiastes 6: 13.
separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
how we doing, Alex?
well, if those braces hold, we could be to the surface sometime tomorrow.
let's rotate.
keep everybody fresh.
welcome to the coal mine, canary.
don't drop your body-water upon me like that!
Hey, it ain't coming from me, I swear.
engineer, come. Look at this.
we hit a pipe or something? - Oh, no.
that's right above our tunnel.
that's not going to hold till tomorrow.
so what do we do?
we leave tonight.
tonight?
I thought you said a nighttime escape was impossible.
so up, the tunnel will collapse again, and that'll be the end of it.
it'll be the end for you.
you're the one on a deadline.
what if it gives out while we're inside?
we end up like buried treasure. - You want out, get out!
look, you're not pulling this off tonight without all of us working around the clock.
and none of us are ever making it out of here without his plan, so if you tell me that you can figure out a way how to do this at night, then I-- we-- can figure out a way how to get that tunnel dug in time.
let's start digging.
I think you dropped something.
I've read in old newspapers that make it to Sona how americans hold others to standards they ignore.
how they think no one should have power but them.
I tell everyone it's a lie, but I see it's true.
Aving.
and I think that after everything I've done to help,
I think it sucks you're not taking me with you!
I know it doesn't seem like it now, but I'm doing you a favor.
I'm giving you a gift.
Oh, wow, life in prison. Thank you.
I've always wanted one of those.
it's better than a life on the run.
I don't belong here.
all I did was give a guy... - you're not going!
I'm sorry.
it's for the best.
how do you know what's best for me?
it's good to go.
you know where and when to be, right?
if you're not there, we're screwed.
you all right?
I'm fine.
I'm just going to grab my stuff. - Yeah.
probably best if you and James disappear.
I know. I know.
you know where to meet us, right?
you'll be on the...
we'll see you tomorrow then.
good luck.
you, too.
Hey, it's that susan chick. She wants to meet again.
good.
let her know everything's on track.
we want to make her feel as comfortable as possible.
why shouldn't she be?
she's going to get her guy tomorrow, right?
well, if Michael's conscience doesn't get in the way.
what do you mean?
he's having doubts.
about if he can pull it off?
about if he should.
but he's going to go through with it, right?
what are you looking for?
where the power lines connect to sona's exterior lights.
if cutting the power out there was an option, why didn't we do that in the first place?
one, the power out there isn't controlled from in here.
and, two, there's that.
every prison has a backup generator.
even if we cut the lights, they'll just come back on again immediately.
well, that's a big, bloody problem.
tell Lechero I need his phone.
change of plans, Linc.
we're doing this tonight.
tonight?
what happened, Michael?
rain, dirt, tunnel, problem.
how long can it hold?
that depends.
depends on what?
when the rain stops.
you said breaking out at night was impossible.
Yeah, well...
you want to tell me how you're going to pull this off?
for starters, I need to get a hold of Sucre.
Sucre, do you know what I do for a living?
I have a pretty good idea.
I read people.
and you, my friend, are a coloring book.
I think you left this in my car.
look. That...that was just...I mean...
No,No, no, no, no.
my fault.
I guess I just didn't make myself clear when I laid out the terms of our arrangement.
so I'm going to try again as simply as I know how.
anything happens-- anything at all I wasn't expecting
and there will be one less pregnant girl in Chicago.
look, Michael and Lincoln don't tell me everything.
Fernando, this is your last chance.
I want a yes or a no.
are the brothers gonna break Whistler out of Sona?
Yes.
are they planning on handing him over to me?
Yes.
okay!
there's one thing I heard.
it's Michael.
he's, he's having some concerns about Whistler.
what kind of concerns?
about handing him over.
you got to understand, he broke out some pretty bad guys last time.
I think he's never forgiven himself for that.
he's planning on leaving him behind?
maybe. I don't know.
Hello, Lincoln.
it's going down tonight.
tonight?
should I be worried?
I called you first thing.
I'm being straight up with you.
that's refreshing.
so I'll see you tonight.
you show me yours and I'll show you mine.
it's going down tonight.
do you know about that?
I didn't know, I swear.
get out of here.
how'd it go?
she found the bomb, Linc.
the one we put in her car.
how did she find the bomb, Sucre?
I don't know, bro. I'm sorry.
it's not your fault.
look, I'll make it up to you, I swear.
you can start now. Michael's in a bit of trouble in Sona.
what kind of trouble?
the rain stopped.
does that mean... - No.
the damage is done.
we can't risk waiting.
anything interesting?
like some coordinates the company might want to get their hands on?
if they didn't want me out of here and your nephew was safe, would you still be doing this?
breaking out?
no.
why would you choose to stay if there was a chance at freedom?
well, I guess that's the difference between us.
I'm waitting to pay for my sins.
and I'm not?
that's a good question.
water's coming down pretty fast up in here, Patron.
Yeah. We have to dig faster.
you know, I've been thinking.
it doesn't have to be every man for himself.
you and I can help each other.
if I need a hand, I'll find someone with a spare.
while it's true I may be lacking something in the west,
I more than make up for it in the north.
think about it.
Scofield's got us down here doing manual labor; slave labor.
I ain't no slave.
I'm doing this for me.
why do you think scofield's up there and we're down here?
he's planning something.
who among us isn't?
what the hell is that?
OK, let's unload here
make the animals walk through the filth
come here
let's go
good. Good! Keep going!
we're good. - Yeah.
we're all right. Okay.
Yeah.
Hello, Lincoln.
long time no see.
not long enough.
I was thinking that we could have a little chat in person.
make sure we're all on the same page about what's gonna happen tonight.
all right.
30 minutes, this location. I'm sending a text. Can't we just...
sorry. What's up?
it's payday
you're first
you need to pick up your check gracias.
see you later.
hello.
Hey, papi, it's me.
Lincoln said you needed some help.
how much do you know about electricity?
Hey, you're back.
I'm not real comfortable being alone down here with those...
what's that?
syrup; honey.
make a little pile of dirt. Gather some dirt.
Scofield said we got to make something to cover the hole once we get out.
so when the lights go back on it's gonna look like nobody ever left.
go ahead. Spread it around.
I was thinking...
we should be a team, you know?
not just during the escape, but after.
like, like Butch and Sundance.
butch and Sundance died.
well, I mean in the other parts.
here's an idea.
we go along with Scofield's plan, and then when everyone stops to take a breath, we grab 'em, Burroughs, Scofield, Bagwell.
we take 'em back home to face charges.
hell, we'd be heroes.
might even get a book deal.
we could write it together, Alex. How'd that be?
a book deal? - Yeah.
gonna make you happy, Brad?
you got a better idea?
Yeah, I do.
something to do with a wife and kid?
Yeah, something like that.
you got room for one more?
come on, Alex.
what's a guy like me gonna do?
let's just let Scofield get us out of here, and then we'll worry about everything else, all right?
all right.
come on. A little more dirt.
listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
you sure you don't want Linc to do this?
he knows more about this than I do.
it's not about what you know.
it's about where you work.
and as a Sona employee, my friend, you have the unique ability of not getting shot for being here.
you see the admin building?
I see it.
go to it and make a left.
to it and left. Got it.
on the other side is a berm.
there should be a metal cage.
that's the backup generator.
okay, I see it.
don't let the tower guard see you get too close.
just act casual.
when I say now, you run and duck behind it.
almost.
hold on.
now!
okay. Okay.
there should be some writing near the bottom.
I need the name of the manufacturer, make and model number, anything.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.
it's, uh, it's, uh, prana industrial.
model number 3210.
all right. Thanks.
that's all I need.
you really think you can pull this off tonight?
you want to know the truth?
no, I just want all of it go down smooth.
for everyone to get what they want.
Yeah, I do.
listen, even if you get this worked out with the lights, what are you gonna do about the jeep patrols?
we're just gonna have to take our chances.
maybe you don't.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Where's Lj?
somewhere safe.
take a load off.
can I offer you a drink?
what's going on, Susan?
I just wanted to get everyone together so we can discuss tonight's agenda.
maybe nail down a few guidelines.
it's the same as before, nothing has changed.
actually, I was thinking we should probably include all the players.
don't you?
what are you doing in here?
just keeping watch.
make sure nobody tries to get down to the tunnel.
who are you calling?
Yeah, hi. Is this, uh, customer service?
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm a sub working, building down here in Panama, and, um, we got a client on-site.
they're asking questions about the 3210 generator we're installing.
Yeah. Exactly.
anyway, they want to know, if the main power shuts down, how long are they gonna be in the dark, um, before the generator kicks in?
Yeah. Thanks. I'll hold.
you're a very good liar.
that's the timing?
no, that's, uh... that's it.
appreciate it.
well? We gonna make it?
we should have just enough dark to make it out.
with everyone?
you with Whistler?
Yes.
Susan has got a message.
Why?
put him on.
it's for you.
yes?
all right, I got him. What now?
tell him I want him to listen very carefully to the following instructions.
she wants you to listen real care... - I can hear.
instructions about what?
was that Sofia?
is she there?
Yeah.
what's going on?
he wants to know what this is about.
all right. I'll tell him.
No!
was... was that just...
is that Sofia?
is that Sofia?
have you figured out the coordinates yet, James?
please.
almost.
wrong answer.
No! - No!
I'll get them for you when we get out of here, I swear.
all your promises, your guarantees-- they mean nothing.
I'm pretty sick of waiting around for you boys to screw me over.
I want those coordinates by the end of the day.
we gotta figure this out.
gotta do something.
gotta do something.
we both know that you can't just hand over that information.
Why?
why can't I?
once they get what they want, they'll have no reason to keep you or your girlfriend or my nephew alive.
so what do I do?
I, I just, I just let them torture Sofia?
we'll work something out.
we'll think it through.
I already have.
what is so special about him anyway, huh?
you think he has anything to do with why them people wanted Scofield down here in the first place?
it's really none of my business.
what exactly is your business, Alex?
something on your mind?
I'm just saying...
if we needed a bargaining chip,
do you think a sharp stick in that dull limey would help us out?
there is no "us.
you and me are a lot more alike than you think, Alex.
we both know how it feels to lose a great love.
how it feels to kill a man.
and we both ended up in here because of Michael Scofield.
wouldn't it be poetic justice if we could just return the favor?
justice, huh?
if there was an ounce of it left in this world...
you'd be lying face down in the same unmarked grave as the rest of your inbred family.
the only difference between me and you, Alex, is a badge, and the last time I checked, you didn't even have that, so you can just keep on hoping for your happy endings, Alex, you just keep on plowing ahead with them blinders on, you know, but the thing about them blinders is...
it makes it really hard to watch you back.
it's gonna be better soon, I promise.
he's right, you know.
if James loves you the way he says he does, he'll give us what we want, and then you and your white knight can ride off into the sunset.
unless you're already with him.
you scared, Susan?
do I look scared, Lincoln?
to pull something like this...
you desperate?
you need to stop fighting with me.
if you really understood what was going on, you would know that we're not the bad guys.
could've fooled me.
haven't you ever done the wrthings for the right reason?
what are the right reasons, Susan?
what is it about Whistler that's so important.
I could tell you.
but then I'd have to kill you.
you're gonna do that anyway.
Whistler gives us what we want, maybe I won't have to.
Lincoln called.
they're on their way.
I figured them out.
the coordinates.
I'm gonna hand them over.
I thought you should know so you can take whatever precautions you can.
what if, uh...
what if you give them the wrong coordinates.
it might buy us some more time.
maybe lincoln can get Sofia to safety.
like he did with Sara?
I'm sorry. I...
I didn't mean to. I, uh...
I just don't know what else to do.
I'm damned if I do. I'm damned if I don't.
there's no way to win.
it's not about winning anymore.
it's about surviving-- which is not the same as giving up.
but you can go gracefully.
there's honor.
protecting the ones you love.
honor's a luxury men like us can't afford.
can you promise me we'll make it out of here tonight?
no games.
can you honestly promise me?
I can promise you I'll do everything in my power.
I wish that were good enough.
if you do this...
if you give them what they want...
everything that's been lost will have been for nothing.
what's up?
take it easy.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Officer Monjares, plesae
hey Arturo. phone for you!
can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm kind of in a hurry
I got some place to be
what's that?
friends of mine are moving tonight
and they need my help
tell them you're gonna be late
let's go
walk Linc, he's gonna...
he's gonna give it to them.
relax.
I'll see you in a minute.
what are you talking about?
all clear.
I suppose introductions are unnecessary at this point.
what are we doing here, Gretchen?
we're here to say good-bye.
I promise you, sweetheart, they're not going to hurt you anymore.
do you have the coordinates, James?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I tried to run away... - this is not your fault.
it's mine.
when I took this job, I knew they weren't good people.
I just didn't know how bad they were.
and everything that's happened...
it's all because of me.
and for that I'm truly sorry.
the coordinates.
just pass them through.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm buying some goodwill.
you're buying her funeral.
you know I have what you need.
and I'll give you the rest.
but only after I know that Sofia, that Lj, and that these men here...
they're all safe.
do you understand me?
everything's gonna be all right.
I'm impressed.
it seems our fisherman grew himself a set of oysters.
can you really trust these men with her life?
Yeah.
Yeah, I believe I can.
all right, James.
but there's been some confusion about the timing of things-- last-minute changes, et cetera.
I'm gonna make this clear for everyone involved.
if time runs out and I don't have the second half of those coordinates, Lj and the senorita stop breathing.
say good-bye, sweetheart.
don't be stupid, lincoln.
I've helped you.
now you help me.
please.
just get us out of here.
bout the timing on the backup generator? - Yeah.
all we got to do now is cut the power to the exterior lights.
how are you gonna do that?
I'm not-- it can't be accessed from the inside.
how much time have I got?
let's say, uh, 5:15 tomorrow morning.
that should give us enough time to dig out the tunnel before the sun comes up.
all right. What about Whistler?
what about him?
well, he manned up-- he could've handed over the information, but he didn't.
still concerned about handing him over?
I've got my concerns about pretty much everybody, Linc.
you know what I mean? - Yeah.
mostly, I'm just tired.
tired of choices...
consequences.
I just want this to be over... tonight.
let's do it.
when you're on the run, you're always looking over your shoulder, listening for the sirens, wondering if that pretty girl across the street is staring at you because she wants you, or...
because you're wanted.
you change your name, the way you look...
and leave everything you ever knew behind.
and the ones you love, they're the ones who have to pay.
that's what's waiting for you on the outside.
that's why I couldn't bring you on.
because nothing good can come of this.
can anything good come from staying in?
it has to be your decision. I...
I cannot be responsible for you.
you won't have to be.
does your father still have that phone number I gave you?
I think so.
well, tell him to call my brother if he wants to find out where to pick you up tomorrow.
does that mean...
it means if a million things fall into place...
I'm gonna see my father tomorrow.
don't let anyone see you with that phone.
I think we did it, Michael.
I believe we're ready.
she's a little wet, but she's ready.
makes me think of the first thing I'll do when we're gonna get out.
just, does anybody know what's spanish for "don't shoot"?
no dispare.
no dis what?
just relax. Nobody's gonna get shot.
just don't panic.
as soon as Linc cuts the power, we go.
what about the jeep patrol?
taken care of.
what about the backup generator?
backup generator?
nobody said anything about...
there's a lag from when the power cuts out to when the generator kicks back in.
well, how long a lag are we talking about here?
30 seconds.
you expect us to run in 30 seconds?
as soon as the lights go out, I'm gone.
with or without you.
please, my friends
they're expecting me and
I have some bad news, Jorge
we won't be able to pay you today
that's fine, I-I can wait until
when we ran your identification through processing...
we found a slight problem
What.kind of a problem
you have a warrant out for your arrest now.
let's go.
off the bus! Now!
as soon as the lights go out, we got to be ready to move.
you want to tell us what the hell the taquito's doing down here?
he's coming with us.
I don't think so.
that's not up to you.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
see, we made up our own decision here.
well, with the time frame being so short and all, we'd feel a whole lot better about things if we go first.
what are you gonna do, kill me?
T-bag: No, no.
see, if we ain't first, he's not - All right! All right! Just...
look, I think I can explain all this
if I could just get some paperwork from my car
you're not going anywhere
understand?
all right.
all right, go. Just go.
just go.
every man for himself, right?
you want to move up in line, too?
no, I think I'm gonna stay back here.
I just don't want to turn my back on anybody.
my name is michael scofield.
I am a fugitive.
three weeks ago, I was incarcerated in a panamanian prison.
while I was there, I was approached by the company...
a corrupt organization involved in all levels of industry and government.
they gave me two options:
break one of their men-- james whistler-- out of that prison...
or they would kill the only woman I ever loved-- dr. Sara tancredi.
I held up my end and broke whistler out.
the company...
they killed sara anyway.
I don't know why the company wanted james whistler out of prison, but I've tracked him here to los angeles.
he's with an agent I know only as gretchen...
the same agent who murdered sara.
it ends today.
I will seek the justice that I now know the system cannot provide.
so if you're reading this letter, you'll know I died avenging sara's death.
you get the data card.
we drop it off in the racing form, and we get the hell out of there.
who's the contact we're leaving it for?
the company wants the card back, period.
all you need to worry about is getting this rig the hell out of there in a hurry.
Oh, I'll be getting it out of there. Don't you worry about that.
you worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time.
if you pull this off, you can come up to my room later and the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.
just make sure we get paid.
in and out.
good to see you again.
you, too.
didn't hear from you for a while.
started to wonder if you were still interested.
I am, very much so.
well, I needed to approach this carefully.
I'm sure you understand.
who you buying it for?
a competitor? A foreign country?
Jason, you know I can't get into that.
now, we've been negotiating this for months.
I've jumped through all your hoops.
I've agreed to meet you here.
do you want to sell the card to me or not?
be right back.
that's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic.
let me give you a little bit of advice
and this is on the house-- watch your step with that thing.
the company will do anything to get it back.
don't I know it.
Yeah. - What the hell are you doing? We got to get out of here.
I need to hide the gun.
take the gun with you!
where is she?
Michael, you don't understand.
call gretchen, get her in here now.
you have to trust me.
I'm not your enemy, michael.
we need to leave.
you know, despite everything...
if sara could weigh in right now, she'd tell me not to kill you.
that's the kind of person she was.
that's the kind of person you took from me.
James, didn't you tell him?
he walked in five... - shut up!
Gretchen, look at me.
this is for sara. - I never killed sara.
I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity.
I swear to god she's alive.
don't. Don't insult me and don't insult her.
she escaped.
we knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage.
I fabricated the whole thing.
my brother saw...
a head in a box! From a cadaver.
you ask lincoln what he really saw.
listen to her, michael.
don't lie to me. - I'm not lying to you.
Lincoln bought it, you bought it, it worked.
then where is she?
I'll tell you when we get outside.
right now, we need to get out of here.
they found the bodies.
give me the gun.
she's lying. - Is she?
if you pull that trigger, you'll never know.
kill him, james. - Shut up.
where is she? Where is sara?
Michael, if you don't give me that gun, I'm going to shoot you in the head.
let's go.
we got a double homicide at the roosevelt hotel.
do you know the difference between a perfectly executed operation and a failed mission?
sir?
it's small unit leadership.
the allies spent two and a half years planning the invasion of normandy, but on d-day it came down to a handful of men on a strip of beach to decide the fate of the world.
what I'm getting at, gretchen, is even the best plan is only as good as the moving parts on the ground executing it.
general, we got your card-- what's the problem?
we have nothing. It's a duplicate.
almost flawless, but a duplicate. - That's impossible. I saw...
you know how important the retrieval of this card is to me, gretchen.
you know that this is a security breach that could have catastrophic ramifications for the company.
the only thing I can think of...
there was a blind spot when whistler was hitting the target.
maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original.
you hired him.
you kept him at the tip of the spear.
you insisted that we get him out of sona.
we had to.
he had already made contact with the target.
at that point, it was him or no one, sir.
what's your stake in all of this?
I had nothing to do with it. Whistler acted on his own. I swear to you.
general, I can fix this.
you trained me.
not well enough, apparently.
you...
please.
I have a bank account in dubai left over from a slush fund from cobra ii. It's yours.
no, please, please...
panama CITY, PANANA hello.
Hey, it's me.
where are you, man?
Los angeles.
you okay, michael? - No, I'm, I'm safe.
thank god, thank god.
how's lj and sofia?
Yeah, they're, um...
I'm staring at them right now in fact. They're fine.
you hear about sona?
what about it?
burned down three days back. The inmates-- they rioted.
no sign of bellick, t-bag, or sucre.
he got popped-- I don't know how.
I mean, the papers listed the names of the inmates, and he was in there when it went down.
I found whistler and gretchen...
and, uh...
Gretchen said...
she said sara is still alive.
what did you see, linc?
what do you mean what did I see, michael?
I need you to tell me exactly what you saw.
Michael, sara's gone.
well, you said it was in a garage, right? So it was dark.
Yeah, it was dark.
but if you're asking me if I picked up the head to check to see if it was sara, no, michael, I-I...
LJ said he...
he only heard them kill sara, right?
you just got to come back, please. Come back. Let's just...
let's just start a new life.
tell sofia I said hi. And tell lj...
tell him his uncle loves him.
Michael, don't do this, please.
Arizona DESERT 5 MILES FROM...
out, out!
you need some better ventilation back there, amigo.
don't worry about it. Gracias.
Where's your mom?
she'll be here.
what do you mean she'll be here? We're-we're running out of time. I got to be up there.
don't worry. My mom wouldn't let me down.
at least, she hasn't yet.
Bradley! Over here!
mom! Mom! I told you!
don't worry, you'll make it there!
what is it called? - Europeangoldfinch. Net.
it's what we can all use to communicate.
Ms: I have info on Sara. Behind the Santa...
don't worry, I'm alone.
it's good to see you.
so where's your new best friend?
well...
I don't know about that, but whistler's not who you think he is.
we're working together against the company.
yeah? - Yeah.
and what about gretchen? She working with you?
he needed her to further his plan.
look, if the guy was company, he'd have shot you dead back at that conference like she wanted him to.
do you have any information about sara or not?
let's go somewhere a little more private.
I want you to tell me right now.
I want you to tell me right now, right here!
or we can get gretchen on the phone.
Gretchen's dead.
she never showed up.
come and talk to me, please.
Whistler and I were at that conference to get a data card.
it's like the company's black book.
and it lists all their agents, all their operations.
they refer to it as "scylla.
Whistler's got it.
Alex, talk to me about sara.
that's all I care about.
I understand that. I want nothing more than to get home to my wife and my son.
but that's not gonna happen for either of us with the company out there trying to kill us.
you don't know anything about sara, do you?
Whistler does. He tells me he does.
and he wants to tell you.
but he wants something in return. - What? What does he want from me?
to talk to you.
I'm sorry about all that the other night.
if i had more time, I would've explained myself better.
sure.
what are we doing here?
Alex told you about scylla?
Yes.
I have it.
there's one last step involved in order to read the data.
and that step involves breaking into a secured structure.
so now you need my help.
Yeah.
my book, the bird book, the one I lost in sona contained information that would've helped facilitate the break-in, but it can still be accomplished, with your help.
Where's sara?
the only thing I know for sure, a week ago, some information came through the wire.
Sara may have bought a bus ticket in santa fe.
headed where?
Chicago.
Michael, if sara's out there, she's not safe-- none of us are.
the company knows we still have the original card, and that's why gretchen was the first to go.
I think we're done here.
we...
have a chance for once to get scylla to people that want to take the company down.
I don't want to run anymore.
we won't have to run anymore.
I spent the last month thinking sara was dead and that it was my fault.
if she's out there, I'm gonna find her.
that's all I care about.
this can be done within a week.
less.
at least let me show you...
Oh, I'm gonna miss these gams, girl.
don't go.
this ain't no home for a white boy from alabama.
the bags are packed.
you kept your word to me.
you're the first that's ever done that. Gracias.
why must you go after this man?
you could choose not to.
where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.
Comprende?
Yes.
michael scofield left me for dead one too many times, as it turns out.
what is spanish for "little angel"?
Adios, angelita.
is this legit?
for the money you're paying, first class, all the way.
so these are coyotes one could trust.
VAMANOS.
as you've seen, what you're entering into is quite serious.
m I realize that.
you're responsible for this now.
you have nothing to worry about.
we'll talk sooN.
it's time to clean up now.
thoroughly.
everyone who was close to whistler: Scofield, mahone, burrows.
Burrows is still in panama.
clean up.
hello.
Hi, pam.
where...
where are you?
uh, you know.
in the middle of it, as usual.
panama still?
no.
no.
are you okay?
definitely.
are you?
Yes.
and cameron?
he's fine.
I have to tell you, pam, you know, I had a plan for all of us to be together.
and...
I'm not gonna stop working on it.
why do you need a plan if you want to be with someone?
you just be with them.
don't say that unless you mean it.
cause I'll turn this world upside down to get back to you.
so don't say it unless you mean it.
I mean it.
okay.
come on, babe.
I-I hate plantains, you know that.
I try your chili burger.
Chili-chili burger?
you loved the chili burger.
okay, I'm gonna make them with my mom's special recipe.
your mom's special recipe?
you'll love it.
Really? - Yeah!
it's delicious.
let's get out of here.
drop 'em.
let's go. - Give me your hand.
Yep - Let's go - Lincoln - Come with me
what's going on?
dad
we're safe now.
relax. - No.
I saw someone.
looks like company, I'm sure of it.
let's just go, okay?
let's go.
We'll-we'll be fine.
all right, all right. - Yeah.
get back.
dad!
dad, we have to run.
go.
get out of here.
run!
I'm looking for alex.
I don't know where he is.
no?
no.
uh, we've been divorced for almost two years now.
we haven't had contact in months.
I would think that might change now that he's back in the U. S.
I am so sick of you people-- what are you a fed?
- Thinking that you can keep on harassing...
I'm not with the government, pam.
mom, could you come here?
we're done talking...
Bruce bennett.
do you know who this is?
I do.
I'm looking for sara, and right now, you're the only person I can think of who can help me.
hold on.
where are you?
back in chicago.
have you heard from her?
meet me in front of the drake hotel in a half hour.
please just tell me...
is she alive?
are you michael scofield?
are you michael scofield?
Yes, I am.
hands on your head.
special agent don self, homeland security.
were you there when james whistler was killed?
I didn't kill him.
I know you didn'T.
he was an independent contractor who worked for the company for about ten years.
he was assigned to retrieve scylla once it went missing.
do you know what scylla is?
it's the company's little black book.
so he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.
what do you want from me?
you're looking at major time.
you know that, right?
so how would you like to walk away from it all...
not do a day? - In exchange for...
Scylla.
all right.
Sara tancredi, last seen in panama, if you help me find her, maybe we've got a deal.
I'm sorry, she's not my department, scylla is.
then go find it yourself.
it seems to me, the U. S.Government should have a little more reach than someone who's looking at major time.
to perform the operation, michael, that would require signatures from about 20 different department heads.
do you want to bet at least one of them is company?
the only way this is going to work is via freelancer, off the books.
it sounds complicated.
I'll take a pass.
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail, not to mention the time that your brother's facing.
what are you talking about?
the company tried to take him out in panama.
he, um...
reacted, apparently.
but I just made a deal with the panamanian authorities for him to serve out his time in the U. S.
he should be touching ground any time now.
you recognize this handwriting?
this is your father'S.
he spent the last two years of his life going after this very thing.
do you believe in fate, michael?
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
what's going...
stop!
stop!
you don't want to go in there.
you don't want to go in there.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God, she'S...
Lilah maria sucre.
she gave her my name?
soy tu papa.
you're setting me up?
Sucre, you can't keep bringing maricruz down.
you can't do this to her anymore.
it's OK. - Wait.
don't...
Sucre, don'T...
go! Go!
Oh, boy.
we're screwed.
you know why scofield gets all twisted up when he's around me?
we're the same, and he just can't stand it.
drives his ass crazy.
we got the same brilliant mind, the same natural-born leader tendency, the same one-in-a-million-type charisma, yes?
he just gonna look down his nose at me?
how you gonna find him?
this.
you're both into birds?
no, no.
it's either gonna take me to him, or he to me.
I just know it.
if I was you, I'd forget about this scofield.
you have plenty of money. See? I mean...
how much money you have in that bag?
why don't you just mind your own beeswax, huh?
you just keep pointing this jalopy northbound, all right?
get me back to the land 'o cotton.
of course.
ready.
only a few people in government will know of the operation.
it has to stay that way, or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.
taking down the company sounds a little bigger than a two-man job, no?
I'm going to get you help.
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.
Yeah, but maybe you can.
all right, two of your cohorts- fernando sucre, and brad bellick were arrested, they're both facing time, and alexander mahone is in a colorado jail cell.
good, let him sit there.
you're going to need mahone if you want to make this happen.
he was working with whistler.
and you'll have me. Okay?
whatever you need, I'll provide.
Whistler also said something about a second step, something about a break-in.
Yeah, the card has all the data on it, but it's encrypted.
once you get your hands on it, you're going to need to find a way to break into the company's headquarters.
it's the only way to unlock what's on the card.
Where's the building? - L. A.
where in L. A? - I don't know.
so, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere, and we've got to break into a building, the location of which has yet to be determined.
simple enough.
you've broken out of two penitentiaries.
I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.
how do you know our dad?
he heard from contacts that I could be trusted.
your father was a good man. - Why now?
look, I've been going after the company for five years. Okay?
when whistler was killed yesterday, the plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.
but, uh... I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.
so this is like job security for you? - What's that?
well, when we go out there and risk our necks, you can collect your pension.
no, no, no, lincoln.
okay, some people still care about their job.
some people still fight for this country.
maybe you've been a little too distracted boosting car stereos and breaking heads to remember that.
if we do this deal, after it's done, you can look for sara...if she's alive.
if we take this deal, we'll both be dead long before I get the chance, linc.
you guys must have some big-time friends.
what are you talking about?
somebody just posted a significant amount of bail for both of you.
who?
I don't know, but they're outside.
you're free to go.
here, take your dad's file. My number's inside.
we ain't doing this. - Just take it anyway.
this file, it means nothing to me anymore.
let's go for a drive.
Thanks.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I have something for you.
okay.
you left this behind.
is that what this is about?
you just getting me my rose back?
Yeah. I guess I'm done now. I can retire.
how much time are you looking at?
they're saying 15 years.
I have to find out for sure.
I heard lincoln say something about a deal.
no jail time.
in exchange for taking down the company.
how?
exactly.
I love you.
that's all I know right now.
will you not yield to the immortal gods?
that nightmare cannot die. Eternal evil itself.
there is no fighting her, no.
no power that can fight her.
now, listen to me- it's up to you now.
all that avails is flight.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry.
6ant to talk about it?
it's not your fault. It's not.
tell me what happened.
it's just the company.
it's just what they do.
it wasn't just me. God, it was you and lj and-and lincoln.
and they won't stop, and I don't know how to deal with that.
Hey, come here.
come here. Come here.
let's go!
are you okay?
I can't believe they found us so fast.
should I call... should I call bruce and-and get some place safe?
no place is safe.
they're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc?
you thinking what I'm thinking?
let's end this. But I'm not gonna leave you behind again.
yeah?
we're in.
hey - Hey, papi.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for you including me.
well, sucre vouched for you, bellick.
he said you came through for him down in panama.
you ready for this? - Yeah. I am.
so I hear whistler's bird book has details about what we need to steal.
Yeah. - You know who's got it, right?
please. We'll die out here.
thanks for the cash, gringo.
first class all the way.
do we have any idea where t-bag is?
that snake could be anywhere.
when we're in L. A. We can think like convicts, we just can't act like them.
if we do, we're done.
it goes without saying- this is your last chance to back out, 'cause first on the list of things I cannot guarantee you is your safety.
we're all a long way from where this started.
but what I can guarantee you is that if we do this thing right, we'll be close to where it ends.
freedom. Finally.
you two- let's go.
Hey, mike?
what about sara?
Sara's in.
all right, we're heading out tomorrow.
I have to finalize a few things before we go.
no games and no stunts.
otherwise, I promise, you're gonna see a whole different side of me.
likewise.
fake ids. It's a good start, but there are some things you can't fake, and there are some things you can't hide.
know what I mean?
how high is your threshold for pain?
you sure you don't want a sedativ we're gonna go into the night.
how do you feel? - Lighter somehow.
look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.
I don't even know who they are, but I do know one thing
the company's gonna pay for what they did to you.
let's go.
you sure you're up for this?
if we can do it together, um... yeah.
OK. - Absolutely.
a c-130? What do they want... want us to parachute out of this thing?
this guy called in a favor to the air force.
it's not like we can be flying commercial, you know?
if you're successful with obtaining scylla, you'll not only avoid jail time, but you can take great pride in knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy.
if you're killed while doing so, a proper funeral will be provided.
but if you try to escape, you will have no funeral.
you will have nothing, and you will be apprehended and buried where we find you.
I sincerely hope we understand each other.
you better hold up your end of the deal.
let's go!
Los ANGELES. CALIFORNIA they ran the projection you asked for, general.
you're clear. Go ahead.
Chicago, ILLINOIS
there's been a complication.
Burrows and scofield have been transferred to...
I read the newspapers.
you don't have to tell me what's in the headlines.
the exact penitentiary where they're being held is undisclosed.
but you can guarantee it'll be federal.
supermax.
no more updates.
call me when they're dead.
welcome to los angeles.
as it turns out, men who have escaped not one, but two penitentiaries, are considered a bit of a flight risk.
so we need to know where you are and what you're doing at all times.
theses are gps ankle monitors.
now step up, take one and put it on.
I ain't wearing that.
let's make this clear: I'm your ally, but more importantly, I'm your boss.
which means if this fails-- it's my ass on the line as much, if not more, than yours, so from this point on, if I ask you to do something, you do it.
if I ask you to say something, you say it.
and if I ask you to put on a monitor-- you put on a monitor.
as far as the general public is concerned, you're being contained in a supermax facility somewhere in the united states.
so to avoid any messy explanations and stay off the company's radar
you need to keep your heads down and your ears open.
we've provided cell phones, clothing, and toiletries
all the basic necessities to get you up and running.
Hey, uh, you-you patted these guys down before you let them in, right?
cause I can't be getting shanked or shivved.
who's this?
this is roland glenn.
he'll be assisting you.
we've already got our team.
no, scofield, see, this is my team, and roland's working off a sentence just like the rest of you.
in fact, with the amount of security that's gonna be around scylla, roland's expertise will be a necessity.
so, if no more questions, let's get to work on finding scylla.
what about that second step?
what about the break-in?
you let me worry about step two, okay?
you just worry about finding scylla.
I've got an idea where to start.
that's excellent, alexander.
see, there's a man who's thinking.
all right, let's let these men get to work.
good luck. To all of us.
Yeah, since I was here first I think I'll just go ahead and grab that S. S. Bedroom, if that's cool.
Sara... - yeah?
you take the bunk.
you know, when this is, when this is all done-- you and me, we're gonna settle up.
all right, obviously, there's a lot of history in this room.
that's a given.
but it we're gonna pull this off, it's gonna take all of us.
we got to work together.
so if anyone has a problem, get it out now.
you want to clear the air with someone...
now's the time.
all right. Let's get to work.
Whistler's assignment was to drop off this, this, this data card
th-this 'scylla' to a company executive.
someone he referred to as "the cardholder.
and his job was to-to protect it.
to... keep it safe.
now, I didn't see who he was, but I got a look at his driver.
his driver?
you want to sketch this guy's face and match it up to 10 million people in los angeles?
well, that's just great.
I saw more than just the guy's face.
all the drivers were hanging around, talking shop, but this guy, he was standing by himself.
legs apart, hands behind his back, at rest-- he's former military.
his car rides a little lower than the rest of 'em.
probably signifies private security.
weighed down by bulletproof siding.
his suit, his suit
you don't buy a suit like that on a cop's salary or pulling weekend gigs as a driver.
that means he's full-time. He's highly paid.
you ask our friend mr. Self to run tax records on the 45- to 55-year-old white males in los angeles drawing a military pension, and taking six figures from a private security company, and you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50.
and then I can pick the guy out from there.
find the driver, you find the cardholder.
Mexican DESERT 60...
we haven't ate or drank anything for days.
Oh, I don't want to die out here.
we ain't gonna die, sancho.
we ain't gonna die. - Okay.
we just gotta find what's called a compass cactus.
due to the fact it always leans toward the south.
inside there's delicious fruit which'll fill our bellies.
tell you what. Why don't we, uh, rest here for a while, huh?
travel at night when it's cooler.
that sounds good.
what are we gonna do when we get there?
to san diego.
you mean after michael pays for the vile he's transgressed upon me?
I'm still trying to figure that out.
nice to work with homeland.
the fbi would take days to gather this intel.
well, the fbi should'a hired me 'cause I could've gotten whatever info you wanted in 25 minutes tops.
you some kind of hacker?
I design silicon lithography for personal gain.
he's an identity thief.
he's a douche.
Hey, why don't you sit in the corner and we'll get you when we need you.
this is him. That's the driver.
now what?
well, he takes us to the cardholder, and the cardholder takes us to scylla.
you could have left me there, in jail.
could have or should have?
maybe both.
are you thanking me, alex? - I don't know.
don't bother. You're here because we needed you. Not because we wanted you.
that's him. That's the guy.
what's that, private security?
it's like a fortress.
slow down. Slow down.
this thing we gotta get, it's in there?
motion sensors, alarm systems, armed guards.
in and out of that place without anybody knowing.
you better have one hell of a plan, michael.
so, basically, there's no freaking way to break in to the place.
not quickly. Not without being seen.
what about the neighbors, uh, somewhere we can be staged from, you know, go under and up?
closest neighbor is here, across the street.
and even that would take weeks.
the government's story about us being held in a supermax will only last so long.
what does that mean?
I mean, then what if somebody finds out we're not.
what if we don't have to be in the house?
if the card-- this scylla-- is so important maybe the guy is carrying it on him.
well, according to public records, the owner of the estate's name is stuart tuxhorn, and he's a ceo of a company called spectroleum.
heavy hitter like that's gonna have security 24-7.
and we gotta get this thing without anyone knowing it's gone, right?
so even if he's got it on him, how do we get it off him?
you don't steal the card. You copy it.
Oh, now you're interested in what I gotta say, right?
copying it will make it harder.
not only do you have to steal it, you have to return it, genius.
only if you don't got me, hombre.
what's that?
this is the reason I got busted.
Oh, you stole the cell phone?
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I'm lookin' at federal time 'cause I stole a cell phone-- seriously?
I invented this so that I don't have to steal.
it looks like a cell phone but it's really like a digital black hole.
wireless hard drive that swallows up any electronic data within ten feet of it.
like what?
like the account info of anyone at starbucks with a latte and a laptop.
like the pin number of any credit card used at a gas pump.
I can walk out of here and get the identities and financial statements of ten people in ten minutes, on a slow day, with one hand on my junk.
and the information embedded in scylla?
if we can get close enough...
it's ours.
is this number... acceptable to you?
10, 000 people?
Yes. - Good.
now that you're on board, we can issue the op-order today.
he's on his way.
all right, hold on.
Sara, it's me.
everybody's on.
now, while I'm monitoring the device,
I'm not gonna be able to see exactly what data's being copied.
but, like downloading quality porn from the internet, progress bar's gonna tell me when it's time to rock and roll.
how long do they need to stay in range?
encrypted data like this is gonna take at least two minutes.
here he comes. Sucre, you're on.
good luck.
easy.
sir, would you mind stepping away from the vehicle?
talk to me, roland.
I got nothing, man.
last time I had this little action, I was dry humping my way through fifth grade.
calm down.
sir... sir...
step away from the vehicle!
okay, bro, just relax-- we don't have to get all excited.
you speak english now.
only a little, but, uh...
how about now? - Nada.
try to get closer to them.
if he was any closer, he'd be in the car.
I get your little act, pedro.
hit the brakes, let the rich guy pay for damage you don't intend to fix.
just give the man some money so we can leave.
Congratulations.
he was there-- I think tuxhorn was in the car. So did we get it or not?
Nope. Nothing.
can I help you?
so how did you find me?
I never lost you.
the, uh, the new nose threw me a bit, but...
what do you want, don?
I got customers.
look, back in the days, when you worked with the company...
well, for the company.
I did economic forecasts of their operations.
I mean, I wasn't one of the guys... - but you had access.
come on-- the last time I helped you, the only thing I got out of it was plastic surgery and a $100, 000 pay cut.
you know, so either you buy one of these exceptional family cars, with above average gas mileage, or you leave me the hell alone.
I know about scylla.
and I'm going after it.
you know, I knew you were crazy.
I didn't know you were stupid, too.
well, let's just say I was able to get my hands on it.
it's my understanding that scylla could only be used if it's plugged into a decoder box that's hidden in one of the company facilities. Am I right?
you know, I wish I could help, but I can'T.
no, you are helping, jasper.
just a matter of whether you do it before or after I shame you in front of your coworkers here.
tell me where the company keeps the box, jasper.
could be anywhere; I don't know.
somebody does. Right?
somebody that you might have access to.
you know, if you go down this road, your government job won't protect you.
then I better not get caught, right?
if I don't find something to eat soon, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
we're not gonna make it.
no, we got to, we got to just keep talking, sancho.
keep our brains focused on something other than our empty bellies and our dry mouths, okay?
come on. Let's start with, uh, your-your favorite color.
hell you doing?
I'm hungry, teddy.
why should the both of us die out here when one of us could help the other one survive?
you don't want to do this. Please. I'll make it quick.
I promise!
why'd you have to go and do something so...
so tuxhorn doesn't keep the card on him.
it must be in there.
look, there's no way we're getting in that house without being seen.
I know.
well, if the card's in there, how we gonna copy it?
we're not.
she's gonna do it for us.
what you reading?
there is no fighting her.
no power can fight her. All that avails is flight.
that's homer.
that's from the odyssey.
is this from my father's folder?
Yeah. And it explains why scylla sounded so familiar.
if I'm not mistaken, it's from that chapter in the book where odysseus is told he has to confront a monster known as scylla.
wonder why he wrote this down.
I could be wrong, but I believe odysseus is told that in order to continue on his path, to pass scylla, it'll require the sacrifice of six of his men.
his only other alternative is to abandon his path.
and he chooses to make the sacrifice.
well, that's a hell of a choice.
one I'm not sure I'm comfortable making.
Sara, um, about tomorrow-- the plan, the housekeeper...
if you're not up to it...
no, no, I am.
Chicago, ILLINOIS
tell me, is claudia mauricio a good roommate?
a good person?
I hope she feels the same about you.
Oh, shelby, you wouldn't believe the traffic on the...
you'll want to be quiet now, claudia.
there are levels of clearance at the department of corrections that are simply not available, even for friends as connected as mine.
so, listen carefully, if you even remotely value your friend's life.
you're going to use your security code to access the records for prisoner transfers and tell me where they sent michael scofield and lincoln burrows.
can I take that for you?
Thanks. - Sure.
that's a great bag. Can I ask you where you got it?
it was a gift from my boss, so I don't really know; sorry.
sure.
Thanks. - There you go.
I, uh... I can never find a good bag.
I'm a teacher, and I have books and grading materials and...
I should probably go ahead and just invest in a wagon one of these days.
Yeah, that's why I love this bag. It has so many pockets.
do you mind if I take a look?
Oh, no. - Thanks.
Ah, thank god, thank god.
you all right, mister?
Yeah, my damn truck blew a gasket a few miles back.
I've been, uh, hoofing it ever since.
where you headed?
San diego.
hell, we can give you a ride, if you'd like.
Hey, what's wrong, man? Eat some bad mexican?
something like that.
same as yesterday, right on schedule.
I hope to hell she's still got that thing in her purse.
tuxhorn residence.
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.
we've been receiving some, uh, strange signals from your property.
we'd like you to check the windows, please.
make sure all the contacts are still active.
all the windows?
Yes, ma'am. Every room in the house.
okay, hold on.
does she still have the bag?
Yeah.
she's got it.
I'm picking up all kinds of gak from the house, man.
small stuff, maybe a digital camera, an mp3 player.
nothing of the size of what we're looking for, though.
keep her moving.
so far, so good, ma'am.
uh, please move on to the next room.
how we doing?
still don't got it.
if the card's in there, it'd be in some kind of...
a safe.
office.
ma'am, our system is showing that thealfunction is coming from a room that's designated as, uh, an office or a den.
you mean the library?
mister doesn't like me going in there.
well, I think he'd like it even less if you went home without properly setting the alarm first, don't you think?
all right, I'll check.
we got something.
the card?
Oh, yeah. File's so big it can't be anything else.
now you just gotta keep her there for two minutes while it finishes the burn.
stall her, we need two minutes.
ma'am, I think we found the source of our problem
if you could just stay at that particular window and hold it closed while we reset the system, that should do it.
talk to me, roland.
it's almost there, almost, almost.
come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on.
come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on.
come on.
got it. - Got it
all right, ma'am, thank you so much for your help.
all we need to do now, man, is just...
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, she's heading back inside.
what for?
I don't know.
Oh, no.
no, we're good.
she's out.
Hey, stop it!
wait here.
I actually had to slow down not to catch you.
I think I pulled a groin.
it's not in the bag.
it's not here.
how could it not be in here?
the device, it's not here-- give me it.
son of a bitch.
go ahead.
before burrows and scofield were allegedlly transferred to arlington, someone posted their bail.
I need to know who.
I'm showing a bruce bennett, former aid to governor frank tancredi.
you think it fell out?
we looked everywhere.
you think we got the thing copied?
like I said, I can't read the content without downloading the device, but...
unless this tuxhorn's got, like, a 50, 000-hour tivo, then, yeah, I think we got it.
doesn't matter if we got it if we can't find it.
where the hell is it?
it's still inside the house.
that's why the maid went back inside.
she must have found it, assumed it belonged to her boss, and then she left it behind.
well, then guess what, fellas, it's game over.
you know how many months it took me to make that thing, michael?
what, you just think I can whip up another e in a couple seconds?
losing it is not the problem.
if they find it, that's the problem.
if they find out someone was after that card, we're done.
what do you mean, done? What does that mean?
does that mean we're gonna go back to prison?
are they gonna kill us?
what the hell does that mean? - Shut up!
it means we're going in to get it.
maybe if we had a few days, we could figure out a way to pull this off, but I gather we don't have that kind of time.
Yeah, you gather right.
look, if you want us to get that device out of there, you gotta throw us a bone, give us some extra help.
what you're asking for requires involving additional people, which, given the covert nature of this operation, I cannot do.
then you're asking for the impossible.
no, what I'm asking for is competence, okay?
I'm not the one who put the entire mission in the hands of a damn maid.
look, if the company finds that copy of scylla before we do, that's it, michael, that's ball game.
they're gonna find out who was behind it, and they're going to ghost us.
all of us.
are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
look, I didn't choose you to do this because I had you in custody.
I chose you to do this because I believed you could pull it off.
Yeah, well, a lot of people have believed in me in the last few months, agent self.
not all of them are alive today.
can you get me back the device or not?
all right, this is what we got.
the housekeeper saw the device as she was leaving the house.
then she disappears back inside for 15 seconds.
so, we know, wherever it is, it's somewhere close to the door.
so, 15 seconds, that's all we have to buy ourselves.
listen, I'm not sure how close we're gonna get to this house, let alone inside of it, but let's say that we do.
the alarm they got installed in this house is triggered 1. 2 seconds after broken contact in any door or window.
which would immediately send the private security guards with their 47 guns rushing into the property.
and after 30 seconds, the alarm company will dispatch vehicles to the property.
three to four, depending on availability.
after confirmation of a break-in, they'll dispatch additional vehicles to seal off any and all exits from the property.
I don't know about this, michael.
it's getting pretty clear why they hired a bunch of cons to do this job.
it's not because they wanted it off the books.
it's because we're expdable.
who's gonna care if a bunch of crooks wind up dead?
it's suicide.
I'm gonna keep looking and see what I can find.
Thuote from the odyssey.
what about it?
I can't shake that line.
all that avails is flight.
what if flight is our onlyly option, linc?
what if our father-- after everything he discovered about the company-- what...
what if that's what he finally realized?
you know, uh, the one thing I remember most about dad was the back of his head.
always walking out the front door.
always running from something.
mom, us, himself.
but the one thing he never ran away from was his belief that the company needed to be taken down.
and we got an opportunity to do that.
then this is our fight, not theirs.
man, this...
this ain't fox river.
these guys chose to be here.
remember that.
they got a choice.
almost.
ready?
go.
go. come on.
let's go.
Where's it coming from?
it's across the street.
come on.
go.
just something across the street.
we got a team checking it out now.
you can go back inside, sir.
must be out of town.
daddy, is everything okay?
Thanks, jim.
let's go.
go!
don't turn around, unless you'd like to experience a great deal of pain over an even greater length of time.
you-you know, just-just take whatever you want here.
the only thing I want from you, bruce, is the answer to a simple question:
where are michael scofield and lincoln burrows?
I only know what-what I read in the papers and...
three days ago, there were 105 inmates in the supermax wing of the U. S. Penitentiary in livingston, texas, where the brothers were allegedly sent.
there are still 105 inmates there, and no one has been released during that time.
someone is playing a shell game, bruce.
I'm just trying to find out who.
I have no criminal jurisdiction over...
I know you bailed them out.
I know you've been in contact with sara tancredi.
I swear to you, I-I have no idea where they are.
I guess we'll see about that.
good luck, teddy.
who needs luck when you got friends like you fellas, huh?
Hey, you mind if I take this old newspaper of yours with me?
no problem. Sorry to hear about your friend, dude.
it's all right.
he had a full life.
later, teddy.
Sandiego. PC Line. B12. 36-24-36
pacific Coach Lines
there you go.
gate Corporation
la
did you get it?
let's make sure we got what we wanted.
Linc. - Yeah.
don't let that thing out of your sight. - All right.
we're halfway there.
all we got to do is that little b and e, and- we're out of here.
reminds me, I need to get ahold of self, see when we can get started.
so what are you gonna do when all this is over?
that's a good question.
brother, whatever this scylla thing is, it is a monster of a code.
I was gonna come down here and ask if you wanted to talk some more about what happened in panama, but, um, I think I already know what you're gonna say.
how's that?
because you're a little like me.
because you're gonna say you're fine, that you can handle it.
so, um, I'll just leave it at this.
I'm here.
whenever you want to talk, I'm here.
thank you.
you know that the only thing that kept me alive when I was being held was the thought of being with you.
but I also knew that if anything happened to me, you were gonna blame yourself, and you would spend the rest of your life puniing yourself for it, and...
I can't bear the thought of that.
so can we make a deal right now that we're even, and just wipe the slate clean and no guilt and no responsibility?
if we're gonna be together, I don't want it to be out of a sense of obligation.
or-or even that we should be, because of what we've been through. I-I...
I just want to start over.
start over.
okay. But, uh, does that mean I have to divorce my wife?
because you're still married to a russian stripper.
well, "a": I've been a little busy, and "b": I'm pretty sure she was czech.
Hey, michael.
what's wrong?
whatever it is, it ain't it. - I don't understand.
I thought you said we copied the card. - No, we did.
but according to the encryption code... okay, how do I make this clear?
if-if scylla was like a pizza, all we got's a slice.
so where's the rest of the data? - I don't know.
I don't know. I mean...
I mean, I don't know how we didn't see this coming. I mean, it-it makes perfect sensE.
it's like the nuclear launch codes.
you don't give all that information to just one person.
how many do you give it to?
okay, that quote your father held onto
in the odyssey, scylla is a six-headed monster that requires a sacrifice of six soldiers in order to pass.
so scylla isn't one card, it's six.
what does that mean? How we gonna find five more of these things?
I'm busy.
I don't care what she looks like.
three tablespoons of water, one of honey. Nothing more.
if she knows something about anything that's going on, I'm going to find it.
rise and shine, bitch.
breakfast.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
all this security makes you wonder what the company's hiding.
only way to know for sure is to find those five other cards, see for ourselves.
think we'll have enough time? - Yeah.
we'll, uh... we'll be fine.
these are GPS ankle monitors.
now, step up, take one and put it on.
when the exchange is over, you and I are gonna spend some quality time.
these aren't release papers.
I did the best I could do.
you need to sign those so I can collect Roland's device.
you want me to give up the one thing that makes me valuable to the team.
Hey, you knew the deal when you came onboard.
do you want to flush it down the toilet because you made a bad move?
this man just came into a $100, 000 inheritance.
I don't recognize him.
if you do see him, would you please give us a call?
you don't work for the IRS?
I don't.
who do you work for?
as of now... myself.
I'm an associate of General Krantz.
the general, he likes his privacy.
I knew you were rotten from the beginning, so I want you to walk me through this and if you can't, I'm gonna call the authorities.
who the hell are you?
the last time a pretty little filly like yourself knocked me senseless and tied me to a chair,
I had to pay for it.
you still might.
that book was a gift from a very dear friend of mine who left this realm all too soon.
the only thing that James Whistler ever gave anybody was the clap.
you have 30 seconds to tell me something that I don't already know.
I followed that book from Panama City, where James Whistler and I were co-incarcerated, to a bus locker in San Diego.
inside was information pertaining to this apartment...
how about that? That ring a bell, huh? Huh?
what do you know about Scylla?
I know I'm holding the keys, because without me, that bird book's about as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.
I commandeered Whistler's alias.
I infiltrated his place of business because it's the gateway to the whole damn thing.
Where's the location?
what do you bring to the jamboree, darling, huh?
aside from those baby blues and a knife?
this is me.
this is Scylla.
this is you.
I am gonna get Scylla.
and it can either be with you...
...or through you.
so why don't you give me that informed decision right now, before I spill your hillbilly guts all over the carpet?
cause you're messing with the wrong bitch.
how may I be of service?
this is unbelievable.
we were planning our move on Scuderi when he chartered the flight. Right.
and no chance you dragged your feet a little bit waiting for Scuderi to charter the flight?
Oh, yeah, we want to drag this out.
Yeah, well, location's pretty convenient, wouldn't you say, Linc?
ROLAND: Uh, Scuderi splitting town kind of caught us a break, huh?
would you shut him up?
no, no.
we could just wait till he comes back. AgriSow makes farm chemicals.
it's not Fort Knox.
you want to bet?
their patents are worth billions.
which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye on those patents.
Yeah, we could breach their security, in a week, minimum. We could get in the guy's house-- week, minimum.
or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town and have card five by midnight. How's that sound?
how does this sound?
if you're not back by midnight you're going to jail.
Yeah, don't I know it.
let's talk outside.
so what's the plan?
we're going to Vegas.
Oh, hell yes!
yo, I call shotgun!
huh? Who's got-- Hey.
so what do you want to talk about, Agent Self?
I've been a part of hundreds of operations during my career
and I'll tell you one thing.
I never been on the top of someone else's hit list.
what are you talking about? What am I talking about?
if this Company hit man Wyatt can find me once, it's only a matter of time until he creeps up in the back of my rearview mirror again.
well, that's not true.
cause you'll never see him coming at all if he's coming after you. Yeah.
that's comforting.
what do you think, I want that?
you're dead, we're all back in jail.
you were an agent longer than me.
what's my play here?
let me get this straight. You turn your back on me and now you want to know my play
that was your fault.
what would you have done?
I've tracked down rapists, killers, even former military, but a structural engineer from Illinois was able to get to me.
want to know how?
Yeah, I want to know. He stopped running.
he got aggressive.
he took the game to me. That's your play.
that's your only play.
I shouldn't have to remind you that killing a federal agent is a complicated matter-- even in our line of work.
perhaps Mahone is just the tip of the iceberg.
we've been searching for the link between
supermax and Burrows and Scofield.
I believe we found it.
if Scofield and Burrows are working with the government, we've got a much bigger problem than one bureaucrat at Homeland Security.
but it begins with that bureaucrat.
and if Don Self is the head of the snake...
make it look like an accident.
my fee just doubled, by the way.
Hello? - Uh, hi, is this Brad?
Yeah.
uh, you came by my office a couple of days ago looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him.
right.
I know where he is.
she wants two grand first. I'm meeting her at noon.
okay, the next card's more important, right?
so Vegas first, then we deal with T-Bag.
shut up!
MAHONE: I'll stay.
all right.
Linc, take, uh,
Sara and Sucre... ...Roland to Vegas.
the rest of us... ...will handle T-Bag
you heard the man, let's go.
Yeah.
can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?
cause I just think that would make this whole thing worthwhile.
be safe.
ay, yo, Vegas, bitches!
he should have the info by now.
okay, what the hell's taking Bellick so long?
Yes. - She wants more money.
how much more? - I don't know.
you got to come talk to this chick.
hold on, hold on.
what's going on, Bellick?
believe it.
sorry, guys, I walked right into it, too.
it's okay. Go. Go! Come on, now!
BELLICK: You have no idea who you're working with, honey.
why don't we skip the theatrics and you just tell us what you want.
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.
time's up. Him, too.
let's all get in the van.
you, too, Mahone.
＃I remember the day we met, Pretty.
you were a scared little college boy sittin' up on those bleachers, tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.
now look at you.
cold. Hard.
like a dried up flower wanting to get watered.
just tell me what you want.
I want to make you bleed.
I want to release the sinner inside of me that got me incarcerated so many years ago.
but it seems you caught yourself a break, Pretty.
I need you.
now...
you gonna cooperate right quick or so help me
I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.
the pages-- look at them.
looks like some kind of map, right? I don't know.
you know enough to chase me down looking for this.
now don't lie to me, Pretty.
whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.
what, like Scylla big?
this is not a game, Theodore.
now, you need to tell me who you've been talking to.
I don't need to do a damn thing.
that's the benefit of being the man with the gun.
you're going to write down everything you already know about Scylla, ...or I'm going to paint these walls with your gray matter.
get to work!
Hey. Michael's position hasn't changed since you called.
how do we know he...?
Bagwell's a psychopath, but he's a psychopath with a plan.
he obviously needs something from Michael, and as long as Michael doesn't give it to him, he'll keep breathing.
all right. I'm coming with you.
no, no, no, no. I got it.
stick to the plan.
ROLAND: Will you forget about Maricruz?
you think she didn't know her sister was trying to set you up, man?
you better get some ass in Vegas, bro.
we're here to copy the card.
then we leave. Got it?
have you heard from Michael?
no. Why?
nothing. I want this thing done.
Vegas ain't my town.
what a fool, huh?
how could anyone not love this place, right?
check this out. Right there.
the Asian guy.
I know I've seen him someplace before.
so what do you have for me?
so what's "GATE"?
excuse me?
it's on that box.
why do you want to know? Just curious.
what if I was to tell you I think you're just stalling?
biding time till you can figure out some MacGyver way to get your ass out of here, huh? I'd say you've got that gun pointed at the one person who can help you.
so why don't you stop wasting my time?
TRISHANNE: Please, don't let him!
how 'bout her, Michael?
any reason why I shouldn't kill her?
let's do a test.
No!
how far gone is Michael Scofield?
Michael, just tell him what he wants!
how far gone is Michael Scofield?!
please, don't let him. Please!
when did it happen, Michael?
please, don't let him...
when did you stop caring about hurting people, huh?
fox River? Sona?
you gonna keep dragging your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?
why don't you put that gun down.
I'll put it down when you start writing down, Pretty!
let her go! Come on，T-Bag，let her go!
last chance. Three!
two! One...
all right! All right!
the pages, they fit together.
but it's not a map.
it's a blueprint.
for what?
our friend, Bellick, is wearing a government-issued ankle monitor.
my guess is that Scofield has one, too.
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.
any minute, federal agents could come blasting through that door.
so what do we do?
feel free to pitch in here, Miss Daisy .
if Scofield knows I'm involved, this is over.
we need to keep him on point.
now, get out there and get that information.
what about the agents?
let 'em come.
how do we even know this guy's out gambling?
the guy's got $300, 000 in credit and a comped room.
he's here. Keep looking.
Hey, Sara.
Hey, uh, I realize this might not be the best time for this, but I still haven't heard from Michael.
they must be dealing with T-Bag.
lincoln, come on. What?
Vegas just isn't your town?
from everything I've heard about you, that would be a pretty big change of pace.
I guess so.
lincoln, please talk to me.
has Michael told you about Mom?
no.
they were much alike.
they got the same mind.
as Mom got older, she started to lose it.
we, uh, later found out it was a symptom of a brain tumor, hama...
hamartoma. Yeah.
as a kid, she got nosebleeds.
they stopped.
in her 30s, they started up again.
she later died of a brain aneurysm.
and you're telling me this, because Michael and his mother are similar in that way, too, right?
he got nosebleeds as a kid.
they stopped, and the last couple of days they started up again.
how old was your mom when she passed away?
Thirty-one.
Michael's just turned 31.
I found him.
keep an eye on him.
okay.
uh, yeah.
can I help you?
I hope so.
any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?
no.
any deliveries scheduled for today?
no.
I'm giving you one more...
what is all this?
you okay?
they told me not to talk to you.
they"? Who's they?
this is Whistler's blueprint.
it's the building where we can find Scylla.
in other words, it's GATE.
Where's Scylla?
I can't be certain until I see the building itself, but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here, below this office.
what is Scylla?
it's The Company's little black book.
I want you to take me to GATE, now.
Ah.
because you can smell that Scylla money, can't you?
that's what you're in it for, just like me.
say it.
come on.
I want you to say it.
I'm in it for the money.
you see?
we ain't so different after all.
yes?
don Self is not at his house.
looks like he cleared out.
notify our people inside the Bureau and LAPD.
I doubt that he could have gotten very far.
sir?
not now.
don Self is here to see you.
got to warn you, friend, she's cold.
good luck, pal.
stay with him.
Scofield's really getting somewhere in there.
man works fast.
says he can't get any further without seeing my former place of employment.
did you take care of our little troll problem?
don't even think about doing this to me.
my name's on the door.
if I didn't think you were valuable, you'd be dead already.
it's-it's just a little sensory overload, guys.
there just wasn't any room for the card.
right. Because if we turn the device on in the casino, it fills up on all the data from the slots.
like when they're about to pay out.
Oh, it's completely unintentional. Really?
Yeah. It's not why you built the damn thing in the first place?
if we didn't need you...
but you do, so just take a brewski and chill, all right?
okay, we need to figure out a way to get Scuderi alone.
Yeah.
the old man just showed up at the pool.
from what he's wearing, there's no way he's got the card on him.
stay with him.
card's in his room.
tell me, Donald, how did you play this moment out in your head?
did you picture yourself coming in here, chest out, jaw squared, ready to demand answers?
did you at any time in your fantasy imagine that you would be this nervous?
honestly, I, uh... I didn't think much past giving you these.
Berlin. Nigeria.
the Comrie Group.
why not JFK and the Lindbergh baby while you're at it?
son, those matters have been fully vetted.
they're relics.
I had nothing to do with them, and if this is why you've been pulling data on me,
I could have saved you a lot of trouble.
okay. Well, these records and a sealed letter explaining my investigation into your involvement with these matters was sent to five lawyers across the country.
if anything happens to me, if I go missing, anything, if I wind up dead, that letter is to be unsealed...
and they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me.
it doesn't matter.
if a government agent who was looking into you is found floating in the L. A. River, or whatever else you have planned, your life, General, will change dramatically.
there will be questions, media coverage and surveillance, and whatever you and the Company are trying to do next with your little Laos game, or whatever else you have planned, it'll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.
okay? So back off of me.
you are not the first person to attempt something like this.
most of the others I now fondly call my colleagues.
they've learned to put their determination and focus to better use, and with far greater compensation.
wrong guy.
we'll see.
dear Mr. White, due to unforeseen circumstances, "I regret to inform you that I will no longer be able "to perform services at GATE.
I thank you for this opportunity.
I'm deeply sorry "if this places you in a difficult position.
I have simply not been able to escape these circumstances.
thank you for the wonderful, enriching opportunity...
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
does it sound like you?
Yeah.
good. Yeah.
look,
I don't even know who you are, okay?
just let me go...
shut up.
and you wondered how I got to be the top salesman in the northeast region.
sorry, okay?
sorry.
consider this a warning.
old Teddy Bagwell may be Coosa County trash, but Cole Pfeiffer's a man of refinement.
one of the Gate Corporation's tippy-top sellers, as a matter of fact.
step into my office.
well, there should be a room-- eight by ten.
Whistler's point of entry.
that's a closet.
no, it's not.
#Tonic and lime, please. Sure.
I'm in the middle of this nightmare.
I wonder if you could help me.
it's my 22-year-old cousin's bachelorette party.
that's hardly the salt mines.
wait for it.
there's a scavenger hunt, and my team has tasked me with getting a photograph in a whale's suite.
I'm a whale?
with a very scary bodyguard and a very gorgeous watch.
and you want to take a picture in my room?
and I realize it's a completely inappropriate request, but they're already calling me a wet blanket.
I'm sorry.
I just can't help you.
what if I said "please"?
I'm actually a little desperate.
best of luck.
drinks are on the gentleman.
have a nice day.
you, too.
don't take it personally.
you're not his type.
right before you sat down, he asked me if I liked to party.
absolutely not! No way! -Oh, come on.
take one for the team.
Maricruz will never know.
I'm gonna snap his neck.
get to his room, stay two minutes, then leave, all right?
Yeah, yeah, and in the meantime, what? In the elevator?
just play hard to get, you know, and then let him nuzzle a little bit. Whoa, whoa...!
Hey, whoa! What option we got?
come on, man. What option we got?
give me one.
you can't. Here.
go ahead. There's nothing back there.
I know.
do we have anything sharp?
so, what are you hearing, uh, Scylla is worth, huh?
me, I'm hearing millions.
is that a rough ballpark in terms of what you, uh... what you've been told?
what do we have here?
go ahead, back up.
you and me and a dark hole.
just like old times, Pretty, you first.
how are the chips falling for you?
spent my last buck on the beer.
what are the options when you're broke in Vegas?
I guess I got to work that out, huh?
what if you didn't have to?
I may have a little business to throw your way.
what kind?
the easy kind...
with a $1, 000 payout.
what's your cognac?
I've never had it.
I've got a 200-year-old bottle in my suite.
join me.
this is private business.
between men.
they're on their way up.
get ready.
I love it-- Mr. Macho Man.
what's next?
I don't know, why don't you figure it out?
I'm done helping you.
sounds like someone's caught in the old captivity of negativity.
let's get you in a more affirmative mindset.
what's next?
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.
and then, you're gonna be arrested and taken back to Fox River.
just how do you plan on...
stop, y'all have no idea what you're doing.
Scofield, you can't do this without me.
self's on his way.
mark my words!
got your message.
y'all have no idea what you're doing!
Thanks, Alex.
great city.
I guess so.
that's the thing about Vegas.
doesn't judge you.
any form of pleasure is acceptable here.
am I crazy, or is there a note of plum in there?
maybe.
have a seat.
did you serve?
serve who?
in the military.
you look like a Devil Dog.
no, sir, I've never been in the service before.
filling up nice.
sucre must be in close proximity.
getting oiled, most likely.
one and half tours in Vietnam.
purple Heart in a friendly fire exchange near Hue.
sorry to hear it.
what I learned at Hue, though valuable, also cost me a great deal.
specifically...
three square inches of upper groin thigh meat.
and with that...
my reproductive and sexual function.
so... so you can't...
Mr. Villalobos, I'd like you to meet my wife.
I'm Alexa.
you want me to bang your wife?
then I'll pay you 1, 000 dollars.
#He's got a minute. Then I'm going after him.
did it copy the card? ROLAND: Yep.
all right, download that. You got five minutes.
well?
his wife was up there.
and...?
it stays in Vegas.
uh, hey, guys.
I'm gonna go hit the head, and I'll be out in a minute, all right?
Yes.
two... two... two pulls.
two pulls, and he won the progressive.
Sara: Where the hell is he?
I'll go get him.
Mr. Glenn.
we got a problem.
it was made clear you were never again welcome in any Nevada gaming establishment.
wait, wait, uh, I was told there was only a five-year...
no such thing was said to you.
what's that do? It's a battery pack for a video game console.
you'll need to buy a new one.
I already downloaded the card onto my laptop, and... and I can build another device.
you said this one takes months.
we don't have months.
you know what?
we ought to leave your ass in the desert.
let's get him back to L. A. and let Self sort him out.
let's go.
for a little guy, he has some set of lungs.
how's Bellick and the girl? All taken care of.
I'm gonna keep T-Bag in protective custody until we get Scylla-- then, I'm gonna make somebody at Illinois DOC very, very happy.
but more importantly, what the hell is that room downstairs?
that's not where they keep the device that decodes Scylla, is it?
no.
that's just what T-Bag thought.
the road to Scylla only begins down there.
this is the room where we've got T-Bag now.
just past the south wall, there's an access tunnel that runs for about 300 yards or so.
we get through that, we're in.
that's where we can decode Scylla.
and this is the building where General Krantz's office is.
there you go. SELF: I was there today, but I have to tell you, the security in that place is unbelievable.
according to the blueprint, the substructure is completely exposed.
it shouldn't take more than 24 hours to get in there. It's only gonna take 24 hours?
all we have to do is get that last card first.
well, based on what I've deciphered so far, we're gonna need around-the-clock access to GATE, starting immediately.
if you can get us some suits and IDs, we could go in there as IRS agents auditing the books-- I mean, considering the kind of racket they're running, nobody would have a problem believing that.
can you make that happen?
Yeah, I could do it.
it's under the can.
Hello?
GRETCHEN: We have a lot in common.
Yeah, who is this?
just another interested party in what you're up to.
Yeah, what's that?
"Scylla," Open the envelope.
the pages I've got only got to 77.
is this more blueprint?
I don't know.
what do you want?
I don't know what you've done with Bagwell, but unless I see him, you're not getting the rest of the pages.
is that right?
give me that.
these are gps ankle monitors.
now, step up, take one and put it on.
when the exchange is over, you and I are gonna spend some quality time.
Mahone: These aren't release papers.
I did the best I could do.
you need to sign those so I can collect roland's device.
you want me to give up the one thing that makes me valuable to the team.
Hey, you knew the deal when you came onboard.
do you want to flush it down the toilet because you made a bad move?
this man just came into a $100, 000 inheritance.
I don't recognize him.
if you do see him, would you please give us a call?
you don't work for the irs?
I don't.
who do you work for?
as of now.
myself.
I'm an associate of general Kantz.
the general, he likes his privacy.
I knew you were rotten from the beginning, so I want you to walk me through this and if you can't,
I'm gonna call the authorities.
who the hell are you?

I know I'm holding the keys, because without me, that bird book's about as meaningful as a fart in a wind storm.

what do you bring to the jamboree, darling, huh?

their patents are worth billions.
which is why companies tend to keep a very close eye on those patents.
Yeah, we could breach their security, in a week, minimum.
we could get in the guy's house-- week, minimum.
or we could follow the guys for 12 hours out of town and have card five by midnight.

how's that sound?

Oh, hell yes!

Yeah!
so what do you want to talk about, Agent Self?

and I'll tell you one thing.
I never been on the top of someone else's hit list.
what are you talking about?
what am I talking about?

well, that's not true.
cause you'll never see him coming at all if he's coming after you.
Yeah.
that's comforting.
what do you think, I want that?

uh, you came by my office a couple of days ago looking for a guy who had an inheritance coming to him.
right.
I know where he is.
she wants two grand first.
I'm meeting her at noon.
okay, the next card's more important, right?
so Vegas first, then we deal with T-Bag.
shut up!
I'll stay.
all right.
Linc, take, uh, Sara and Sucre.
roland to Vegas.
the rest of us.
will handle T-Bag.
you heard the man, let's go.
promise me something, would you?
Yeah.
can you get me Carrot Top's autograph?
cause I just think that would make this whole thing worthwhile.
be safe.
ay, yo, Vegas, bitches!
he should have the info by now.
okay, what the hell's taking Bellick so long?
Yes.
she wants more money.
how much more?
I don't know.
you got to come talk to this chick.
hold on, hold on.
what's going on, Bellick?
believe it.
sorry, guys, I walked right into it, too.
go.
come on, now!
go!
you have no idea who you're working with, honey.
why don't we skip the theatrics and you just tell us what you want.
I'd love to put a hole right in your head.
time's up.
him, too.
let's all get in the van.
let's all get in the van now.
you, too, Mahone.
I remember the day we met, pretty.
you were a scared little college boy sittint up on those bleachers, tryin' to keep your ass out of the game.
now look at you.
cold.
hard. Like a dried up flower wanting to get watered.
just tell me what you want.
I want to make you bleed.
I want to release the sinner inside of me that got me incarcerated so many years ago.
but it seems you caught yourself a break, pretty.
I need you.
now.
you gonna cooperate right quick or so help me I'm gonna stomp you till you can't stand.
the pages-- look at them.
looks like some kind of map, right?
I don't know.
you know enough to chase me down looking for this.
now don't lie to me, pretty.
whatever's in that book-- it is bigger than you and me.
what, like Scylla big?
this is not a game, Theodore.
now, you need to tell me who you've been talking to.
I don't need to do a damn thing.
that's the benefit of being the man with the gun.
now.
you're going to write down everything you already know about Scylla, aneverything you learn from that book.
or I'm going to paint these walls with your gray matter.
get to work!
hello.
all right. I'll be right there.
Hey.
Michael's position hasn't changed since you called.
how do we know he.
Bagwell's a psychopath, but he's a psychopath with a plan.
he obviously needs something from Michael, and as long as Michael doesn't give it to him, he'll keep breathing.
all right.
I'm coming with you.
no, no, no, no.
I got it.
stick to the plan.
will you forget about Maricruz?
you think she didn't know her sister was trying to set you up, man?
you better get some ass in Vegas, bro.
we're here to copy the card.
then we leave.
got it?
have you heard from Michael?
no.
Why?
nothing.
I want this thing done.
Vegas ain't my town.
what a fool, huh?
how could anyone not love this place, right?
check this out.
right there.
the Asian guy.
I know I've seen him someplace before.
so what do you have for me?
so what's "Gate"?
excuse me?
it's on that box.
why do you want to know?
just curious.
what if I was tell you I think you're just stalling?
biding time till you can figure out some macgyver way to get your ass out of here, huh?
I'd say you've got that gun pointed at the one person who can help you.
so why don't you stop wasting my time?
please, don't let him!
how about her, huh?
how about her, Michael?
any reason why I shouldn't kill her?
let's do a test.
No!
how far gone is Michael Scofield?
Michael, just tell him what he wants!
how far gone is Michael Scofield?
please, don't let him.
when did it happen, Michael?
please, don't let him.
when did you stop caring about hurting people, huh?
you gonna keep dragging your feet while I put a bullet in her brain?
why don't you put that gun down.
I'll put it down when you start writing down, pretty!
last chance.
three!
two!
one.
all right!
the pages, they fit together.
but it's not a map.
it's a blueprint.
for what?
our friend,Blick, is wearing a government-issued ankle monitor.
my guess is that Scofield has one, too.
I knew that son of a bitch was slow-walking me.
any minute, federal agents could come blasting through that door.
so what do we do?
I need you to get the make and serial number of that monitor.
feel free to pitch in here, miss daisy.
if Scofield knows I'm involved, this is over.
we need to keep him on point.
now, get out there and get that information.
what about the agents?
let them come.
how do we even know this guy's out gambling?
the guy's got $300, 000 in credit and a comped room.
he's here.
keep looking.
Hey, Sara.
Hey, uh, I realize this might not be the best time for this, but I still haven't heard from Michael.
they must be dealing with T-Bag.
lincoln, come on.
what?
Vegas just isn't your town?
from everything I've heard about you, that would be a pretty big change of pace.
I guess so.
lincoln, please talk to me.
has Michael told you about mom?
no.
they were much alike.
they got the same mind.
as mom got older, she started to lose it.
we, uh, later found out it was a symptom of a brain tumor, hama.
hamartoma. - Yeah.
as a kid, she got nosebleeds.
they stopped.
in her 30s, they started up again.
she later died of a Brain Aneurysm.
and you're telling me this, because Michael and his mother are similar in that way, too, right?
he got nosebleeds as a kid.
they stopped, and the last couple of days they started up again.
how old was your mom when she passed away?
Thirty-one.
Michael's just turned 31.
yeah?
I found him.
keep an eye on him.
okay.
uh, yeah.
can I help you?
I hope so.
any boyfriends or roommates I should know about?
no.
any deliveries scheduled for today?
no.
I'm giving you one more.
what is all this?
you okay?
they told me not to talk to you.
they?
who's they?
this is Whistler's Blueprint.
it's the building where we can find Scylla.
in other words, it's Gate.
Where's Scylla?
I can't be certain until I see the building itself, but I'm pretty sure it's somewhere down here, below this office.
what is Scylla?
it's the company's little black book.
I want you to take me to Gate, now.
because you can smell that Scylla money, can't you?
that's what you're in it for, just like me.
say it.
come on.
I want you to say it.
I'm in it for the money.
you see?
we ain't so different after all.
yes?
don Self is not at his house.
looks like he cleared out.
notify our people inside the Bureau and Lapd.
I doubt that he could have gotten very far.
sir?
not now.
don Self is here to see you.
got to warn you, friend, she's cold.
good luck, pal.
stay with him.
Scofield's really getting somewhere in there.
man works fast.
says he can't get any further without seeing my former place of employment.
did you take care of our little troll problem?
don't even think about doing this to me.
my name's on the door.
if I didn't think you were valuable, you'd be dead already.
it's-it's just a little sensory overload, guys.
there just wasn't any room for the card.
right. Because if we turn the device on in the casino, it fills up on all the data from the slots.
like when they're about to pay out.
Oh, it's completely unintentional.
Really? - Yeah.
it's not why you built the damn thing in the first place?
if we didn't need you.
but you do, so just take a brewski and chill, all right?
okay, we need to figure out a way to get Scuderi alone.
Yeah.
the old man just showed up at the pool.
from what he's wearing, there's no way he's got the card on him.
stay with him.
card's in his room.
tell me, Donald, how did you play this moment out in your head?
did you picture yourself coming in here, chest out, jaw squared, ready to demand answers?
did you at any time in your fantasy imagine that you would be this nervous?
honestly, I, uh.
I didn't think much past giving you these.
Berlin.
nigeria.
the Comrie Group.
why not JFK and the Lindbergh baby while you're at it?
son, those matters have been fully vetted. They're relics.
I had nothing to do with them, and if this is why you've been pulling data on me, - I could have saved you a lot of trouble. - Okay.
well, these records and a sealed letter explaining my investigation into your involvement with these matters was sent to five lawyers across the country.
if anything happens to me, if I go missing, anything, if I wind up dead, that letter is to be unsealed.
and they will find cold trails that lead nowhere near me.
it doesn't matter.
if a government agent who was looking into you is found floating in the L. A. River, or whatever else you have planned, your life, general, will change dramatically.
there will be questions, media coverage and surveillance, and whatever you and the company are trying to do next with your little laos game, or whatever else you have planned, it'll be next to impossible with thousands of eyes on you.
okay? So back off of me.
you are no the first person to attempt something like this.
most of the others I now fondly call my colleagues.
they've learned to put their determination and focus to better use, and with far greater compensation.
wrong guy.
we'll see.
dear Mr. White, due to unforeseen circumstances,
I regret to inform you that I will no longer be able "to perform services at Gate.
I thank you for this opportunity.
I'm deeply sorry if this places you in a difficult position.
I have simply not been able to escape these circumstances.
thank you for the wonderful, enriching opportunity.
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
does it sound like you?
Yeah.
good. - Yeah.
look, I don't even know who you are, okay?
just let me go. - shut up.
and you wondered how I got to be the top salesman in the Northeast Region.
sorry, okay?
sorry.
consider this a warning.
old Teddy Bagwell may be coosa county trash, but Cole Pfeiffer's a man of refinement.
one of the gate corporation's tippy-top sellers, as a matter of fact.
step into my office.
well, there should be a room-- eight by ten.
Whistler's point of entry.
that's a closet.
no, it's not.
tonic and lime, please.
thank
I'm in the middle of this nightmare.
I wonder if you could help me.
it's my 22-year-old cousin's bachelorette party.
that's hardly the salt mines.
wait for it.
there's a scavenger hunt, and my team has tasked me with getting a photograph in a whale's suite.
I'm a whale?
with a very scary bodyguard and a very gorgeous watch.
and you want to take a picture in my room?
and I realize it's a completely inappropriate request, but they're already calling me a wet blanket.
I'm sorry. I just can't help you.
what if I said "please"?
I'm actually a little desperate.
best of luck.
drinks are on the gentleman. Have a nice day.
you, too.
don't take it personally. You're not his type.
right before you sat down, he asked me if I liked to party.
absolutely not! No way!
Oh, come on. Take one for the team.
Maricruz will never know.
I'm gonna snap his neck.
get to his room, stay two minutes, then leave, all right?
Yeah, yeah, and in the meantime, what? In the elevator?
just play hard to get, you know, and then let him nuzzle a little bit.
what option we got?
come on, man. What option we got? Give me one.
you can't. Here.
go ahead. There's nothing back there.
I know.
do we have anything sharp?
so, what are you hearing, uh, Scylla is worth, huh?
me, I'm hearing millions.
is that a rough ballpark in terms of what you, uh.
what you've been told?
what do we have here?
go ahead, back up.
you and me and a dark hole.
just like old times, pretty.
you first.
how are the chips falling for you?
spent my last buck on the beer.
what are the options when you're broke in Vegas?
I guess I got to work that out, huh?
what if you didn't have to?
I may have a little business to throw your way.
what kind?
the easy kind.
with a $1, 000 payout.
what's your Cognac?
I've never had it.
I've got a 200-year-old bottle in my suite.
join me. This is private business.
between men.
they're on their way up.
get ready.
I love it-- Mr. Macho man.
well, well, well.
what's next?
I don't know, why don't you figure it out? I'm done helping you.
sounds like someone's caught in the old captivity of negativity.
let's get you in a more affirmative mindset. What's next?
I think I'm gonna lock you in this room.
and then, you're gonna be arrested and taken back to Fox River.
just how do you plan on.
stop, you all have no idea what you're doing.
Scofield, you can't do this without me.
self's on his way.
mark my words! - Got your message.
T-Bag: You all have no idea what you're doing!
Thanks, Alex.
great city.
I guess so.
that's the thing about Vegas.
doesn't judge you.
any form of pleasure is acceptable here.
am I crazy, or is there a note of plum in there?
maybe.
have a seat.
did you serve?
serve who?
in the military.
you look like a devil dog.
no, sir, I've never been in the service before.
filling up nice.
sucre must be in close proximity.
getting oiled, most likely.
one and half tours in Vietnam.
purple heart in a friendly fire exchange near Hue.
sorry to hear it.
what I learned at Hue, though valuable, also cost me a great deal.
specifically.
three square inches of upper groin thigh meat.
and with that.
my reproductive and sexual function.
so. so you can't.
Mr. Villalobos, I'd like you to meet my wife.
I'm Alexa.
you want me to bang your wife?
and I'm gonna pay you $1, 000. Dont let your tv become just a box.
did it copy the card? - Yep.
all right, download that. You got five minutes.
well?
his wife was up there.
and.
it stays in Vegas.
uh, hey, guys.
I'm gonna go hit the head, and I'll be out in a minute, all right?
Yes.
two. Two. two pulls.
two pulls, and he won the progressive.
where the hell is he?
I'll go get him.
Mr. Glenn.
we got a problem.
it was made clear you were never again welcome in any Nevada gaming establishment.
wait, wait, uh, I was told there was only a five-year.
no such thing was said to you.
what's that do?
it's a battery pack for a video game console.
you'll need to buy a new one.
I already downloaded the card onto my laptop, and.
and I can build another device.
you said this one takes months. We don't have months.
you know what? We ought to leave your ass in the desert.
let's get him back to L. A. And let Self sort him out.
let's go.
for a little guy, he has some set of lungs.
how's Bellick and the girl?
all taken care of.
I'm gonna keep T-Bag in protective custody until we get Scylla
then, I'm gonna make somebody at Illinois doc very, very happy.
but more importantly, what the hell is that room downstairs?
that's not where they keep the device that decodes Scylla, is it?
no. That's just what T-Bag thought.
the road to Scylla only begins down there.
this is the room where we've got T-Bag now.
just past the south wall, there's an access tunnel that runs for about 300 yards or so.
we get through that, we're in.
that's where we can decode Scylla.
and this is the building where general Krantz's office is.
there you go.
self: I was there today, but I have to tell you, the security in that place is unbelievable.
according to the blueprint, the substructure is completely exposed.
it shouldn't take more than 24 hours to get in there.
it's only gonna take 24 hours?
all we have to do is get that last card first.
well, based on what I've deciphered so far, we're gonna need around-the-clock access to Gate, starting immediately.
you can get us some suits and ids, we could go in there as irs agents auditing the books
I mean, considering the kind of racket they're running, nobody would have a problem believing that.
can you make that happen?
Yeah, I could do it.
it's under the can.
Hello?
we have a lot in common.
Yeah, who is this?
just another interested party in what you're up to.
Yeah, what's that?
Scylla. Open the envelope.
the pages I've got only go up to 77.
is this more blueprint?
I don't know.
what do you want?
I don't know what you've done with Bagwell, but unless I see him, you're not getting the rest of the pages.
is that right? - Give me that.
who is this?
Hello, Michael.
what do you want with Scylla?
same thing you want: Bring down the company.
we need the pages.
are we partners?
partners.
so your brother told me about your nosebleeds.
I'm fine.
you don't look fine.
sorry.
consider this a warning.
Linc, pull back!
it's a trap!
you all right?
damn, you're hit!
all right, all right.
you'll get your shot, now back off!
this is an attempt on my card.
how do you want to proceed?
I want it moved.
move Scylla.
now!
now, tell the general you killed us.
otherwise, my hand, it ain't going to get tired.
I just hope your mouth gets tired.
that's funny.
come on, buddy, come on.
enough already, come on, Linc.
believe me now?
beating him isn't going to work, Lincoln.
you tried your way.
we want general Krantz to think Wyatt took us out.
you don't think a trained military veteran is going to hear the fear in his voice?
they're going to know he was coerced.
I hear you, Linc, but he can't make the call if he's unconscious.
however we do it, we better get what we need from Wyatt soon, because Mahone ain't going to wait.
I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid!
Lisa, what are we looking at?
initial estimate is three days to complete the move of Scylla.
unacceptable.
respectfully, this is not as simple as unplugging a laptop and moving it to another room.
the data on Scylla is too delicate.
I don't want excuses.
all I care is that it's done right and done right now.
I understand the urgency, but it will take three days.
and if I may sak freely,
I think it's a mistake to move Scylla to the raven rock bunker when the Los Angeles facility is one of the most secure ones we have.
the most secure location we have is the one they don't know about.
sir.
still no word from Wyatt.
he only uses the company-issued cell, so we can't track him.
we have no way of confirming if he successfully completed his operation.
keep calling him!
and draft a press release, photographs, criminal records, everything we have on Scofield, Burrows, all of them.
tell our friends in the media I want them to saturate the evening news and the morning papers.
I want it impossible for them to walk down the streets of Los Angeles without being spotted.
I assume we haven't made much progress with our friend overhere?
any suggestions?
how about we talk to him?
great, want to give him some milk and cookies while you're at it?
no. How about just some nice conversation?
so they sent Florence Nightingale toet me all ready to cooperate.
actually, I'm here to help you, despite what you've done.
because I'm still a doctor and you're a prisoner.
you're going to save me?
don Self has a metal case out there and I don't know what's in it.
I imagine you don't want to find out, so I figure if you and I had a talk.
you'd make me see the light.
if you don't call the general, you're as good as dead.
I've already been a lot of things worse than dead in my life, doctor.
you better have more than that to threaten me with.
come on, Mike, she's okay.
he's a professional killer.
don't worry, he's locked up.
let's go.
come on, let's go!
so what'd you do with Roland's body?
he's been, uh, reconfigured and given a permanent resting place.
good.
take his bowling shirts and the rest of his crap with you when you leave.
come on Linc, the guy died.
he died a punk!
he ratted us out, Bellick.
you guys, you deal with the matter at hand.
assuming these pages are correct, and there's no way of knowing that they actually are.
we follow this basement hallway through the boiler room to here.
there's some kind of elevated walkway.
we follow that to the end, and we've covered most of the distance between Gate and the company's headquarters.
what's this thing at the end of the walkway?
I don't know-- Whistler marked it with an "x
so I'm thinking it's some kind of wall or serious impediment.
that's why we're going down there prepared.
tools, thermal lances, sledgehammers.
okay, so we get through that wall.
what's on the other side?
again, I don't know.
it's because Gretchen has the rest of the pages.
but once we're through this location, we can't go any further until she gives them back.
what's her game in all this?
I mean, if she wants the company to go down, she should just give us the pages.
look, we're going to deal with gretchen when the time is right, okay?
you guys need to go to Gate and get started.
I'm going to stay here with Wyatt and make sure we get what we need.
no more dawdling now.
move your ass.
high gear, gentlemen, high gear.
my boss will be here any minute.
I assume I don't have to mention that discretion is paramount.
in other words, silence is golden.
you just make sure you stay in your office and you keep other people out.
Oh, I'll stay in my nice, air-conditioned office, pretty.
and you can crawl down into your little hole now.
go ahead.
go ahead, crawl.
what the hell is going on here?
Mr. White, are you back already?
how are you?
fine, until I found a resignation fax waiting for me from Andrew Blauner.
a resignation?
she hasn't seen or heard from him.
she's worried sick.
he's probably on a bit of a bender, just sleeping it off somewhere.
he's a boy scout.
none of this makes any sense, Cole.
but I'll tell you what, I'm going to look into it.
let me know if I can be of any assistance.
good morning. Assistance.
what is that sound?
yeah?
I hope you're having a lovely enjoyable morning, because while you are nowhere to be found, there is sleuthing going on here regarding the whereabouts of one Mr. Andrew Blauner.
And?
and if I'm going down for this little homicide, I ain't going alone.
we're going together like traffic and weather.
relax, okay?
they'll never find the body where I put it.
now, where are Scofield and Burrows?
just doing their end of the bargain.
which begs the question, what the hell are you doing?
me?
I'm getting ready for a meeting.
so, your friends have been calling a lot.
they must be wondering where you are.
that's right.
they're wondering, and the longer they do, the more danger you're in.
call the general, and say what they want you to say.
and what?
you'll let me go?
no, but Don Self will make sure that you spend the rest of your life in a decent facility without the death penalty.
either way, if I make the call or not, I'm dead.
you know that.
and we both know that you, as a doctor, won't let that happen.
so, please, let's you and I figure a way out of this mess that works for everybody.
sit your ass down! Get out of my way!
out!
I will cuff your ass to that table, okay?
all right, I know this is hard.
and I know what y want to do.
okay, but I'm trying to do something here and you need to deal with that reality.
have you lost a kid?
Yeah, I did, too.
my wife was pregnant.
and there were complications and the doctor messed up.
and she.
and they both.
they didn't make it.
okay? So I understand.
what would you do if you were me and that doctor was right there?
what would you do?
I don't know what I would do.
look, I'm giving you my word.
when the time is right, I won't stand in your way.
when the time is right I won't let you.
okay. - Okay.
did you see the way Mahone was looking at Wyatt?
the guy is hurting.
it was more than just hurting, that's pain.
I never cared about anything like that.
I look at what I've done with my life, beating on cons at Fox River, chasing money, trying to keep my own ass out of prison.
this the pathway you talking about?
according to the map, this runs almost the length of that courtyard.
it should put us directly beneath company headquarters.
shh, listen.
there it is again.
what's that noise, Scofield?
I don't know.
okay, just so we're clear, we get to go up that ladder towards the noise that we don't know what it is.
but if we're lucky, we get to basically just walk smack into the company?
sounds about right.
you up for it?
Oh, yeah, after you.
I am no different than that man over there.
who wants to kill me.
alexander Mahone was forced to do things by the company, and so was I.
but I know people.
people in government.
people that can help you and Michael.
I can give you a phone number.
arrangements can be made.
all you have to do is trust me and this will all be over.
it is over.
has, um, White had anything new to say about Blauner?
no, but he might.
Mr. Pfeiffer?
detective Conor Mara I was hoping I could talk to you about Andrew Blauner.
of course.
great.
it's down this way.
this is it!
this is where the sound was coming from.
one of the main conduit pipes for the LA water supply.
30, 000 gallons of water rushing through th very spot every second.
Oh, great.
there's got to be some other way to get around it, some other pathway or something.
no, we took the only pathway down and it leads right here.
how about over it?
we can't risk tunneling too close to the surface.
what do we do?
we dig.
truth be told, uh, Mr. Blauner isn't officially a missing person,
here we are.
Hey, that's not to say though that there aren't some things that concern me.
Really? Such as?
well, the fax that came into white's office anging continues came from a copy shop, but blauner had a fax machine at his house.
okay.
and about a half hour after he resigned, his car was seen leaving the Gate garage.
now, the driver couldn't be identified, but it appeared as though a woman's hands were seen gripping the steering wheel.
let me stop you right there.
it always seemed to me that Mr. Blauner was, how can I put this delicately, um, a swordsman.
you know what I mean?
actually, I don't.
he might be dipping his snout into a different trough,
from what I've, uh, heard about him from his other co-workers, that doesn't sound too likely.
if you don't mind me asking, what is that banging noise?
that's, uh.
it's trouble with the pipes.
you know, they loosened up, it was a moderate quake and now they shake more than the trembler itself.
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh, some people here have told me that you and Blauner didn't get along.
would you mind talking to me a little bit about that?
a few years ago, a partner of mine did this same move agait an enemy combatant we picked up at the new Mexico border
this guy didn't want to talk, he didn't know anything.
it worked then, it should work now - is that ambulance you got us still out back? - Yeah.
Hey, come on, pal,
I got almost a decade on you and you don't see me sucking air.
I got shot, Brad.
Oh, yeah.
guys, we ain't making any progress here.
there's nothing beneath this cement but granite.
we couldn't get through it with a jackhammer.
maybe we should go back to the warehouse, find another way.
there is no other way.
this is it!
this is where the plans lead; this is our way to Scylla.
what?
we got millions of gallons of water in this drain pipe.
we can't go under it, we can't go over it.
I know.
but maybe we can go through it.
it's loose!
all right, Linc, this ought to do it.
after I'm done, how much time we got?
not a lot.
be careful.
you, too.
when I was a little boy, I had an old tomcat named Rufus.
he was a good mouser.
tough as nails, solid feline all around.
one day, I bring home this little kitty from a giveaway box outside the Pic 'n save.
old Rufus didn't like that one bit.
he arched his back, hissed like a rattlesnake and sprang out his claws like a switchblade.
you know, that new little kitty didn't do nothing wrong but be new.
now, that's all I did.
I was being new, and Blauner was being this old tomcat spraying his territory.
now, I don't hold that against him.
if he didn't prote his turf I'd question his character.
but aside from a little jealousy on his part, our issues were as thin as tissues.
I assure you that.
detective, I pulled Blauner's travel schedule as per your request.
thank you.
uh, what's this?
uh, sir, uh, we need to step out for a few more bracket-joints for the shelving.
uh, all right, yeah.
but I ain't paying you to stop for, uh, a coffee and donuts, so get back here toot sweet.
Hey, wait up, Manuel.
I hired some men, uh, out of my own pocket of course, to, uh, add some built-in uh, uh, storage in my closet-- I hope you don't mind.
here's the monthly breakdown of where he traveled.
you're gonna talk to me now?
me?
no.
we're done talking.
but you're not.
Wyatt's voice: They are all dead.
it's over.
Wyatt's voice: This will all be over.
this will all be over.
it's over.
they are dead, they are all dead.
it's over.
I'm going to take this.
can you take a walk?
Yeah.
come on, Sara, we should go.
let's go outside.
my son's autopsy report said that he had....
that he'd been shot twice.
once in the stomach.
why, man?
Why?
just to terrify my wife?
and then a full five minutes later, right in the.
you too will suffer.
and when.
and when you can't stand the pain anymore, you'll make a phone call for me.
you know, Scofield said that torture wouldn't work because the general would hear the fear in your voice.
but the thing is.
I want the person on the other end of my call to hear the fear in your voice.
press release, sir.
in short, it sets forth that members of the fox river eight and their accomplices are alive and well in Los Angeles.
where have you been?
they are all dead. It's over.
good work.
your payment will be left where we arranged.
this is no longer necessary.
go ahead.
the access code to the covert entrance is still both your daughters' birthdays.
everyone leave us alone.
I said everyone leave us alone.
it's okay.
she won't hurt me.
I knew you'd come home.
so, how are you holding up, you know, not being with Lj and all?
good, he's a smart kid.
he can look after himself.
I can see it, how much you love him.
my dad died when I was a little kid.
but he was a good father.
let's just focus and get this thing done, all right?
michael said the manual override should be somewhere near the main conduit.
this look like the main conduit to you?
one way to find out.
that look like it to you?
looks like it. - Fire it up.
all right, let's get out of here.
hurry up, bro!
almost done, buddy.
all right, ease it back.
it worked.
how long we got?
I don't know.
water cut off to thousands of people.
the city will probably have that taken care of in about an hour, which means we've got.
60 minutes to do 90 minutes worth of work.
or we don't t to Scylla.
what's wrong, papi?
what's wrong, papi? Papi, talk to me!
what's wrong? Talk to me!
Michael, what's wrong?
you want some water?
I'm okay.
you're alot of things right now, my friend, and okay ain't one of them.
you know, I may not be the smartest guy, but I hear things.
Sara and your brother have been talking about you not feeling well or something.
look, I'm just, I'm just saying.
I need your help.
so, please, just, uh.
cover for me.
you got it.
truth is, Gretchen, I know you better than you know yourself.
so you keep telling me.
when I first met you, you were a 20 year old girl who'd just been dumped by the wheeling police academy for failing her psych evaluation.
but where those good old west Virginia boys could only see an emotional disconnect with traces of sociopathic tendencies,
I saw a Machiavellian streak that would make failure an impossibility.
I had to let Wyatt do what he did because I needed to know.
what my little bulldog may have known about Whistler and his plans for scylla.
I told you that I knew nothing.
you should have believed me.
I knew you'd never take it personally, because you are, and have been ever since I took you under my wing.
my girl.
my girl.
the most sensitive nerve endings are right here.
that's why acupuncturists avoid placing needles anywhere near them because opening up the nerve endings in the fingertip
even a little pinprick-- can result in quit a painful hot flash.
so a five inch needle being driven up the length of the finger.
can make your insides feel like they're on fire.
another fact of physiology, the human body when in extreme duress begins to shut down.
brain activity decreases and your heart rate slows until you just can't feel the pain anymore.
and that's where the heart monitor and the battery come in.
cause when your heart rate dips below 50, that battery will give you a wake-up call, preventing your body from shutting down.
and then you will feel every ounce the pain.
and that's when you're going to beg me to make the phone call.
what can I do you for?
I. I found some more inconsistencies in your sales reports.
listen up here.
from that little computer of yours, can you access into Gate's records?
if I access the network as an administrator, I can see the files in a non-pdf format.
I don't know what that means, but I assume it was a yes.
so you let your fingers do the walking across that keyboard and you get me my sales records.
you are hurting my arm.
and don't make me hurt any more of you. Now, go.
that's good work.
here.
I need you to measure this hole.
and then make one of the same size in the wall opposite.
how?
you got a belt?
we have less than 30 minutes until this pipe is flooded with water again.
acceptance is important, Wyatt.
I had to accept I had to accept that my son is gone.
and you have to accept that your life, your very, very short life-span ahead of you is just ing to be filled with agonizing pain.
at least until you do what I've asked of you.
and then.
then the pain will go away.
we're running out of time!
Aw, man. - What's wrong?
the stupid thing is empty!
all right.
I'm coming in.
you can't do this, bro.
just finish it.
Hello?
it's me.
what's going on?
somebody needs to tell you something.
you call her by her fit name.
I'm...
sorry.
it's over.
and I love you.
I love you.
this thing is heavy!
sure, show up when all the hard work is done.
all right, ease it back.
we heard on the radio that dwp is going to have the water running in 10 minutes.
you all right?
the sleeve is too heavy to just slide it through the pipe.
two of us are going to have to go inside and guide it through that other hole.
that pipe can flood at any time.
I'll do it.
I'll go, too.
no, I'll go.
Oh, no offense, college boy, but this sucker's heavy.
you're going to need a little bulk down there.
all right.
use this to brace the sleeve when you pull it through to the other side.
and, uh.
let's get the hell out of there, all right?
how's Emmy?
I didn't come here to listen to you pretend to care about her.
or me.
I came here to tell you that I'm a free agent now.
the community we run with know that I'm alive and available.
I can just as easily work for one of them as I can for you.
so the question is, what's your offer?
actually, the question for you is why would you want to go anywhere else?
it's not a time for grudges, Gretchen.
it's a time for coming together.
the salad days are fast approaching.
laos worked perfectly.
soon the populace will turn to us
the leaders of the military, finance and energy-- to right the ship.
and then.
we'll rebuild this country in our own image.
and when we do, I want you there beside me, Gretchen.
as my number two, like I always promised.
what about Lisa?
I've already td you.
you're my girl.
come on.
over there.
right up there.
you and I are the same, Alex.
I've done things.
push!
Bellic keep going, keep going!
keep going!
keep going!
Yeah, it's good right there.
you got it? - That's it.
I don't know how long that's going to hold.
all we got to do is pull this thing through.
Oh, my god. Come on, guys, push!
it broke!
the beam, it broke!
Mr. White.
I'm sorry to bother you, but, uh, after my talk with detective Mara,
I was thinking about mr. Blauner and some of the conversations we had.
salesmen are a lot like fishermen, right?
always bragging about their big catch.
well, andy never talked about his sales, no matter how much I pried.
so I took the liberty of looking them up.
and there were, to say the least irregularities.
good afternoon to you, too, Andy.
two of your top buyers don't have valid social security numbers.
I checked out the social security numbers of the clients he allegedly sold gate workshops to.
in some cases the numbers are just pure fabrications.
but the checks must've cleared.
he's must've been money laundering for god only knows what kind of criminal exploits.
the point is.
if the good officer gets his hands on these papers, you know you're going to be up to your eyeballs in irs auditors.
I suggest you go tell Mr. Mara that you found some irregularities in blauner's expenses.
writing off personal matters, et cetera.
this will explain why he disappeared and will placate the po-po.
okay.
listen, detective.
pick it up! Pick it up!
I can't, it's too heavy!
the brace must have snapped.
let's try and get it up!
it's not moving!
the water's coming.
the water's coming!
come on!
we got to leave it there.
but then we'll never get Scylla.
we don't have a choice.
you don't, I do.
what the hell are you doing?
what the hell are you doing?
Brad, don't do this!
grab it, grab it, now!
the water's coming!
get your ass up here, now!
come on, come on!
you hear that?
they're flooding the pipe.
get out of there!
it's too loud, he can't hear you!
come on, man, there's still enough room for you to get through the hole.
I let go othis you could drop it.
it's too heavy!
Brad, drop the sleeve and get out of there!
don't do this.
you have a son!
don't do this. Don't do this!
push it!
push it, Scofield!
push!
push it!
push it! Push it!
Brad, no!
Brad! Brad, no! Brad! Brad!
Brad, no!
you can all come back in now.
everything's fine.
it always was.
you're okay?
couldn't be better.
more important: What's happening with Scylla?
I'll tell you in private.
you can tell me in front of Gretchen.
not until I say something else.
if you ever come near him with a gun again.
you'll what?
that will do.
Scylla.
we got preliminary safeguards in place faster than we expected.
we could move Scylla tomorrow if we wanted, but now that Wyatt's eliminated Scofield and Burrows, there's no need.
Scofield and Burrows are dead?
dead as latin.
go ahead with the plan.
if a couple of boys from illinois could get that close, it's time to mix things up.
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.
he wouldn't climb up.
he just wouldn't climb up.
whe does the south pipe lead to?
maybe we can follow. - no.
no, he's gone.
what do you want with Scylla?
same thing you want: Bring down the company.
we need the pages.
are we partners?
partners.
so your brother told me about your nosebleeds.
I'm fine.
you don't look fine.
sorry.
consider this a warning.
Linc, pull back!
it's a trap!
you all right?
damn, you're hit!
all right, all right.
you'll get your shot, now back off!
this is an attempt on my card.
how do you want to proceed?
I want it moved.
move Scylla.
now!
now, tell the general you killed us.
otherwise, my hand, it ain't going to get tired.
I just hope your mouth gets tired.
that's funny.
come on, buddy, come on.
enough already, come on, Linc.
believe me now?
beating him isn't going to work, Lincoln.
you tried your way.
we want general Krantz to think Wyatt took us out.
you don't think a trained military veteran is going to hear the fear in his voice?
they're going to know he was coerced.
I hear you, Linc, but he can't make the call if he's unconscious.
however we do it, we better get what we need from Wyatt soon, because Mahone ain't going to wait.
I'm trying to find the son of a bitch who killed my kid!
Lisa, what are we looking at?
initial estimate is three days to complete the move of Scylla.
unacceptable.
respectfully, this is not as simple as unplugging a laptop and moving it to another room.
the data on Scylla is too delicate.
I don't want excuses.
all I care is that it's done right and done right now.
I understand the urgency, but it will take three days.
and if I may sak freely,
I think it's a mistake to move Scylla to the raven rock bunker when the Los Angeles facility is one of the most secure ones we have.
the most secure location we have is the one they don't know about.
sir.
still no word from Wyatt.
he only uses the company-issued cell, so we can't track him.
we have no way of confirming if he successfully completed his operation.
keep calling him!
and draft a press release, photographs, criminal records, everything we have on Scofield, Burrows, all of them.
tell our friends in the media I want them to saturate the evening news and the morning papers.
I want it impossible for them to walk down the streets of Los Angeles without being spotted.
I assume we haven't made much progress with our friend overhere?
any suggestions?
how about we talk to him?
great, want to give him some milk and cookies while you're at it?
no. How about just some nice conversation?
so they sent Florence Nightingale toet me all ready to cooperate.
actually, I'm here to help you, despite what you've done.
because I'm still a doctor and you're a prisoner.
you're going to save me?
don Self has a metal case out there and I don't know what's in it.
I imagine you don't want to find out, so I figure if you and I had a talk.
you'd make me see the light.
if you don't call the general, you're as good as dead.
I've already been a lot of things worse than dead in my life, doctor.
you better have more than that to threaten me with.
come on, Mike, she's okay.
he's a professional killer.
don't worry, he's locked up.
let's go.
come on, let's go!
so what'd you do with Roland's body?
he's been, uh, reconfigured and given a permanent resting place.
good.
take his bowling shirts and the rest of his crap with you when you leave.
come on Linc, the guy died.
he died a punk!
he ratted us out, Bellick.
you guys, you deal with the matter at hand.
assuming these pages are correct, and there's no way of knowing that they actually are.
we follow this basement hallway through the boiler room to here.
there's some kind of elevated walkway.
we follow that to the end, and we've covered most of the distance between Gate and the company's headquarters.
what's this thing at the end of the walkway?
I don't know-- Whistler marked it with an "x
so I'm thinking it's some kind of wall or serious impediment.
that's why we're going down there prepared.
tools, thermal lances, sledgehammers.
okay, so we get through that wall.
what's on the other side?
again, I don't know.
it's because Gretchen has the rest of the pages.
but once we're through this location, we can't go any further until she gives them back.
what's her game in all this?
I mean, if she wants the company to go down, she should just give us the pages.
look, we're going to deal with gretchen when the time is right, okay?
you guys need to go to Gate and get started.
I'm going to stay here with Wyatt and make sure we get what we need.
no more dawdling now.
move your ass.
high gear, gentlemen, high gear.
my boss will be here any minute.
I assume I don't have to mention that discretion is paramount.
in other words, silence is golden.
you just make sure you stay in your office and you keep other people out.
Oh, I'll stay in my nice, air-conditioned office, pretty.
and you can crawl down into your little hole now.
go ahead.
go ahead, crawl.
what the hell is going on here?
Mr. White, are you back already?
how are you?
fine, until I found a resignation fax waiting for me from Andrew Blauner.
a resignation?
she hasn't seen or heard from him.
she's worried sick.
he's probably on a bit of a bender, just sleeping it off somewhere.
he's a boy scout.
none of this makes any sense, Cole.
but I'll tell you what, I'm going to look into it.
let me know if I can be of any assistance.
good morning. Assistance.
what is that sound?
yeah?
I hope you're having a lovely enjoyable morning, because while you are nowhere to be found, there is sleuthing going on here regarding the whereabouts of one Mr. Andrew Blauner.
And?
and if I'm going down for this little homicide, I ain't going alone.
we're going together like traffic and weather.
relax, okay?
they'll never find the body where I put it.
now, where are Scofield and Burrows?
just doing their end of the bargain.
which begs the question, what the hell are you doing?
me?
I'm getting ready for a meeting.
so, your friends have been calling a lot.
they must be wondering where you are.
that's right.
they're wondering, and the longer they do, the more danger you're in.
call the general, and say what they want you to say.
and what?
you'll let me go?
no, but Don Self will make sure that you spend the rest of your life in a decent facility without the death penalty.
either way, if I make the call or not, I'm dead.
you know that.
and we both know that you, as a doctor, won't let that happen.
so, please, let's you and I figure a way out of this mess that works for everybody.
sit your ass down! Get out of my way!
out!
I will cuff your ass to that table, okay?
all right, I know this is hard.
and I know what y want to do.
okay, but I'm trying to do something here and you need to deal with that reality.
have you lost a kid?
Yeah, I did, too.
my wife was pregnant.
and there were complications and the doctor messed up.
and she.
and they both.
they didn't make it.
okay? So I understand.
what would you do if you were me and that doctor was right there?
what would you do?
I don't know what I would do.
look, I'm giving you my word.
when the time is right, I won't stand in your way.
when the time is right I won't let you.
okay. - Okay.
did you see the way Mahone was looking at Wyatt?
the guy is hurting.
it was more than just hurting, that's pain.
I never cared about anything like that.
I look at what I've done with my life, beating on cons at Fox River, chasing money, trying to keep my own ass out of prison.
this the pathway you talking about?
according to the map, this runs almost the length of that courtyard.
it should put us directly beneath company headquarters.
shh, listen.
there it is again.
what's that noise, Scofield?
I don't know.
okay, just so we're clear, we get to go up that ladder towards the noise that we don't know what it is.
but if we're lucky, we get to basically just walk smack into the company?
sounds about right.
you up for it?
Oh, yeah, after you.
I am no different than that man over there.
who wants to kill me.
alexander Mahone was forced to do things by the company, and so was I.
but I know people.
people in government.
people that can help you and Michael.
I can give you a phone number.
arrangements can be made.
all you have to do is trust me and this will all be over.
it is over.
has, um, White had anything new to say about Blauner?
no, but he might.
Mr. Pfeiffer?
detective Conor Mara I was hoping I could talk to you about Andrew Blauner.
of course.
great.
it's down this way.
this is it!
this is where the sound was coming from.
one of the main conduit pipes for the LA water supply.
30, 000 gallons of water rushing through th very spot every second.
Oh, great.
there's got to be some other way to get around it, some other pathway or something.
no, we took the only pathway down and it leads right here.
how about over it?
we can't risk tunneling too close to the surface.
what do we do?
we dig.
truth be told, uh, Mr. Blauner isn't officially a missing person,
here we are.
Hey, that's not to say though that there aren't some things that concern me.
Really? Such as?
well, the fax that came into white's office anging continues came from a copy shop, but blauner had a fax machine at his house.
okay.
and about a half hour after he resigned, his car was seen leaving the Gate garage.
now, the driver couldn't be identified, but it appeared as though a woman's hands were seen gripping the steering wheel.
let me stop you right there.
it always seemed to me that Mr. Blauner was, how can I put this delicately, um, a swordsman.
you know what I mean?
actually, I don't.
he might be dipping his snout into a different trough,
from what I've, uh, heard about him from his other co-workers, that doesn't sound too likely.
if you don't mind me asking, what is that banging noise?
that's, uh.
it's trouble with the pipes.
you know, they loosened up, it was a moderate quake and now they shake more than the trembler itself.
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh, some people here have told me that you and Blauner didn't get along.
would you mind talking to me a little bit about that?
a few years ago, a partner of mine did this same move agait an enemy combatant we picked up at the new Mexico border
this guy didn't want to talk, he didn't know anything.
it worked then, it should work now - is that ambulance you got us still out back? - Yeah.
Hey, come on, pal,
I got almost a decade on you and you don't see me sucking air.
I got shot, Brad.
Oh, yeah.
guys, we ain't making any progress here.
there's nothing beneath this cement but granite.
we couldn't get through it with a jackhammer.
maybe we should go back to the warehouse, find another way.
there is no other way.
this is it!
this is where the plans lead; this is our way to Scylla.
what?
we got millions of gallons of water in this drain pipe.
we can't go under it, we can't go over it.
I know.
but maybe we can go through it.
it's loose!
all right, Linc, this ought to do it.
after I'm done, how much time we got?
not a lot.
be careful.
you, too.
when I was a little boy, I had an old tomcat named Rufus.
he was a good mouser.
tough as nails, solid feline all around.
one day, I bring home this little kitty from a giveaway box outside the Pic 'n save.
old Rufus didn't like that one bit.
he arched his back, hissed like a rattlesnake and sprang out his claws like a switchblade.
you know, that new little kitty didn't do nothing wrong but be new.
now, that's all I did.
I was being new, and Blauner was being this old tomcat spraying his territory.
now, I don't hold that against him.
if he didn't prote his turf I'd question his character.
but aside from a little jealousy on his part, our issues were as thin as tissues.
I assure you that.
detective, I pulled Blauner's travel schedule as per your request.
thank you.
uh, what's this?
uh, sir, uh, we need to step out for a few more bracket-joints for the shelving.
uh, all right, yeah.
but I ain't paying you to stop for, uh, a coffee and donuts, so get back here toot sweet.
Hey, wait up, Manuel.
I hired some men, uh, out of my own pocket of course, to, uh, add some built-in uh, uh, storage in my closet-- I hope you don't mind.
here's the monthly breakdown of where he traveled.
you're gonna talk to me now?
me?
no.
we're done talking.
but you're not.
Wyatt's voice: They are all dead.
it's over.
Wyatt's voice: This will all be over.
this will all be over.
it's over.
they are dead, they are all dead.
it's over.
I'm going to take this.
can you take a walk?
Yeah.
come on, Sara, we should go.
let's go outside.
my son's autopsy report said that he had....
that he'd been shot twice.
once in the stomach.
why, man?
Why?
just to terrify my wife?
and then a full five minutes later, right in the.
you too will suffer.
and when.
and when you can't stand the pain anymore, you'll make a phone call for me.
you know, Scofield said that torture wouldn't work because the general would hear the fear in your voice.
but the thing is.
I want the person on the other end of my call to hear the fear in your voice.
press release, sir.
in short, it sets forth that members of the fox river eight and their accomplices are alive and well in Los Angeles.
where have you been?
they are all dead. It's over.
good work.
your payment will be left where we arranged.
this is no longer necessary.
go ahead.
the access code to the covert entrance is still both your daughters' birthdays.
everyone leave us alone.
I said everyone leave us alone.
it's okay.
she won't hurt me.
I knew you'd come home.
so, how are you holding up, you know, not being with Lj and all?
good, he's a smart kid.
he can look after himself.
I can see it, how much you love him.
my dad died when I was a little kid.
but he was a good father.
let's just focus and get this thing done, all right?
michael said the manual override should be somewhere near the main conduit.
this look like the main conduit to you?
one way to find out.
that look like it to you?
looks like it. - Fire it up.
all right, let's get out of here.
hurry up, bro!
almost done, buddy.
all right, ease it back.
it worked.
how long we got?
I don't know.
water cut off to thousands of people.
the city will probably have that taken care of in about an hour, which means we've got.
60 minutes to do 90 minutes worth of work.
or we don't t to Scylla.
what's wrong, papi?
what's wrong, papi? Papi, talk to me!
what's wrong? Talk to me!
Michael, what's wrong?
you want some water?
I'm okay.
you're alot of things right now, my friend, and okay ain't one of them.
you know, I may not be the smartest guy, but I hear things.
Sara and your brother have been talking about you not feeling well or something.
look, I'm just, I'm just saying.
I need your help.
so, please, just, uh.
cover for me.
you got it.
truth is, Gretchen, I know you better than you know yourself.
so you keep telling me.
when I first met you, you were a 20 year old girl who'd just been dumped by the wheeling police academy for failing her psych evaluation.
but where those good old west Virginia boys could only see an emotional disconnect with traces of sociopathic tendencies,
I saw a Machiavellian streak that would make failure an impossibility.
I had to let Wyatt do what he did because I needed to know.
what my little bulldog may have known about Whistler and his plans for scylla.
I told you that I knew nothing.
you should have believed me.
I knew you'd never take it personally, because you are, and have been ever since I took you under my wing.
my girl.
my girl.
the most sensitive nerve endings are right here.
that's why acupuncturists avoid placing needles anywhere near them because opening up the nerve endings in the fingertip
even a little pinprick-- can result in quit a painful hot flash.
so a five inch needle being driven up the length of the finger.
can make your insides feel like they're on fire.
another fact of physiology, the human body when in extreme duress begins to shut down.
brain activity decreases and your heart rate slows until you just can't feel the pain anymore.
and that's where the heart monitor and the battery come in.
cause when your heart rate dips below 50, that battery will give you a wake-up call, preventing your body from shutting down.
and then you will feel every ounce the pain.
and that's when you're going to beg me to make the phone call.
what can I do you for?
I. I found some more inconsistencies in your sales reports.
listen up here.
from that little computer of yours, can you access into Gate's records?
if I access the network as an administrator, I can see the files in a non-pdf format.
I don't know what that means, but I assume it was a yes.
so you let your fingers do the walking across that keyboard and you get me my sales records.
you are hurting my arm.
and don't make me hurt any more of you. Now, go.
that's good work.
here.
I need you to measure this hole.
and then make one of the same size in the wall opposite.
how?
you got a belt?
we have less than 30 minutes until this pipe is flooded with water again.
acceptance is important, Wyatt.
I had to accept I had to accept that my son is gone.
and you have to accept that your life, your very, very short life-span ahead of you is just ing to be filled with agonizing pain.
at least until you do what I've asked of you.
and then.
then the pain will go away.
we're running out of time!
Aw, man. - What's wrong?
the stupid thing is empty!
all right.
I'm coming in.
you can't do this, bro.
just finish it.
Hello?
it's me.
what's going on?
somebody needs to tell you something.
you call her by her fit name.
I'm...
sorry.
it's over.
and I love you.
I love you.
this thing is heavy!
sure, show up when all the hard work is done.
all right, ease it back.
we heard on the radio that dwp is going to have the water running in 10 minutes.
you all right?
the sleeve is too heavy to just slide it through the pipe.
two of us are going to have to go inside and guide it through that other hole.
that pipe can flood at any time.
I'll do it.
I'll go, too.
no, I'll go.
Oh, no offense, college boy, but this sucker's heavy.
you're going to need a little bulk down there.
all right.
use this to brace the sleeve when you pull it through to the other side.
and, uh.
let's get the hell out of there, all right?
how's Emmy?
I didn't come here to listen to you pretend to care about her.
or me.
I came here to tell you that I'm a free agent now.
the community we run with know that I'm alive and available.
I can just as easily work for one of them as I can for you.
so the question is, what's your offer?
actually, the question for you is why would you want to go anywhere else?
it's not a time for grudges, Gretchen.
it's a time for coming together.
the salad days are fast approaching.
laos worked perfectly.
soon the populace will turn to us
the leaders of the military, finance and energy-- to right the ship.
and then.
we'll rebuild this country in our own image.
and when we do, I want you there beside me, Gretchen.
as my number two, like I always promised.
what about Lisa?
I've already td you.
you're my girl.
come on.
over there.
right up there.
you and I are the same, Alex.
I've done things.
push!
Bellic keep going, keep going!
keep going!
keep going!
Yeah, it's good right there.
you got it? - That's it.
I don't know how long that's going to hold.
all we got to do is pull this thing through.
Oh, my god. Come on, guys, push!
it broke!
the beam, it broke!
Mr. White.
I'm sorry to bother you, but, uh, after my talk with detective Mara,
I was thinking about mr. Blauner and some of the conversations we had.
salesmen are a lot like fishermen, right?
always bragging about their big catch.
well, andy never talked about his sales, no matter how much I pried.
so I took the liberty of looking them up.
and there were, to say the least irregularities.
good afternoon to you, too, Andy.
two of your top buyers don't have valid social security numbers.
I checked out the social security numbers of the clients he allegedly sold gate workshops to.
in some cases the numbers are just pure fabrications.
but the checks must've cleared.
he's must've been money laundering for god only knows what kind of criminal exploits.
the point is.
if the good officer gets his hands on these papers, you know you're going to be up to your eyeballs in irs auditors.
I suggest you go tell Mr. Mara that you found some irregularities in blauner's expenses.
writing off personal matters, et cetera.
this will explain why he disappeared and will placate the po-po.
okay.
listen, detective.
pick it up! Pick it up!
I can't, it's too heavy!
the brace must have snapped.
let's try and get it up!
it's not moving!
the water's coming.
the water's coming!
come on!
we got to leave it there.
but then we'll never get Scylla.
we don't have a choice.
you don't, I do.
what the hell are you doing?
what the hell are you doing?
Brad, don't do this!
grab it, grab it, now!
the water's coming!
get your ass up here, now!
come on, come on!
you hear that?
they're flooding the pipe.
get out of there!
it's too loud, he can't hear you!
come on, man, there's still enough room for you to get through the hole.
I let go othis you could drop it.
it's too heavy!
Brad, drop the sleeve and get out of there!
don't do this.
you have a son!
don't do this. Don't do this!
push it!
push it, Scofield!
push!
push it!
push it! Push it!
Brad, no!
Brad! Brad, no! Brad! Brad!
Brad, no!
you can all come back in now.
everything's fine.
it always was.
you're okay?
couldn't be better.
more important: What's happening with Scylla?
I'll tell you in private.
you can tell me in front of Gretchen.
not until I say something else.
if you ever come near him with a gun again.
you'll what?
that will do.
Scylla.
we got preliminary safeguards in place faster than we expected.
we could move Scylla tomorrow if we wanted, but now that Wyatt's eliminated Scofield and Burrows, there's no need.
Scofield and Burrows are dead?
dead as latin.
go ahead with the plan.
if a couple of boys from illinois could get that close, it's time to mix things up.
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.
he wouldn't climb up.
he just wouldn't climb up.
whe does the south pipe lead to?
maybe we can follow. - no.
no, he's gone.
you have a hypothalamus hamartoma.
the doctor feels that you need surgery.
otherwise, you could die.
are you not following direct orders?
Oh, I'm following direct orders, sir.
just not from you anymore.
I would've died on this table if it weren't for you, Doc.
what?
time to come home now.
You'reoing to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.
his name is Vikan, and he's not a buyer, he's a conduit.
let's go.
and Bagwell's staying here.
I warned you not to screw me over.
it's been a long time, Gretchen. Who's he?
I'm the guy that's holding Scylla.
it's incomplete. There's a piece missing, slick.
Hello, don
I believe you have something that belongs to me.
come and get it.
just so it's fresh in your mind, this isn't a magic elixir.
you still need a hospital.
you need real equipment.
could probably use a doctor who's still got a license to practice medicine.
first we get Scylla.
then I'll go to the hospital.
you finished?
just about.
so, I take it you're ready to talk now?
actually, I'm ready to meet.
I got a better idea.
Michael: Everyone out!
you're surrounded.
come out with your piece of Scylla, Michael.
you first.
come out, or I'm going to gas you out.
if it's the latter, I have a full magazine with 30 rounds.
want to bet at least one of them could outrun you?
what makes you think I'd even keep the piece on me?
I know you, Michale. You're not letting that thing out of your sight.
Michael: I stand by my original offer.
come and get it.
OK.
stay low. Let the gas rise to the ceiling
this is a big space, b it won't ta ke many more of those before we start to asphyxiate.
Where's Lincoln?!
here we go, Michael.
all right, now we take a ride and we pick up Scylla.
or I put a bullet in your head.
it ain't gonna happen.
try me.
GRETCHEN: Good morning.
okay, all right, now that we all have guns pointed at us, let's talk, okay?
fine.
you could start by telling me who I'm talking to, Don?
you're talking t o a guy who spent 17 years in service of his government, all by the book.
you know what the sum total of it was?
nothing. Nada.
but we're very similar, chael, and fundamentally, we want the same thing.
and I have a way to get it.
how's that?
I got a buyer for Scylla.
a guy who wants to destroy the Company as much as you do.
and he's willing to pay a lot of money for it.
lincoln: How much?
nine figures in an offshore account of your choosing.
so, there it is.
or...
you could stand by your principles.
I'll pass.
look, I burned you, right?
and I'd apologize, but what's the point?
we're all out in the cold now.
but we're not going to be able to hide from the Company on a shoestring budget.
who's the buyer?
he's an ex-Company guy with a bone to pick.
just like your father.
I'd need to meet him first.
that can be arranged.
and just so you know, this...
this wasn't personal. This is just business.
we'll be in touch.
we stick to the plan, all right?
we're ing to get Scyll a.
we wait for Alex to come through on his end.
all right?
wheeler: Hello, Alex.
you came.
I always do, to the detriment of my pay grade.
these last few weeks,
I've been part of an off-the-books operation under the hand of Homeland Security.
Felicia, the people I'm working with, we're this close to coming up with the one thing that can destroy the Company:
their little black book. We can get it. Names, numbers.
look, I don't want to get caught up in some interagency politics.
so, if this is Homeland's show...
homeland buried the operation. We can't come back in.
but we could still take the Company down.
so, my question to you is:
who do you know in the Bureau that you can trust?
it used to be you, Alex.
I've lost a lot of things these last few months, not the least of which is your trust.
but I don't come to you hat in hand.
Scylla is real.
but if you don't want anything to do with it, it's okay.
it's all right; I could walk away.
Yeah, there is someone who might be able to help.
ferguson: Si there are over ten million faces in Los Angeles.
even with NSA and CIA satellite links, we're going to be sifting through millions of gigabytes of image data.
Scofield and Burrows... it's not good.
well, let's improve e odds.
self and the brothers may have stolen Scylla but none of them have the connections to off-load it.
add Gretchen's face to the search.
she won't be welcome in Scofield's camp.
so, connect her image with Self's.
we find those two within five feet of each other anywhere in Los Angeles, and we've found Scylla.
are you friends with my Auntie Gretchen?
go play in your room. Mommy will be in soon.
Where's her daddy?
Gretchen doesn't talk about him.
so, Emily doesn't know that you ain't...
that Gretchen's her mama?
no, and I'd like to keep it that way.
cute girl.
don't hurt my little girl.
if you have to do something, do it to me.
what do you think I am?
a monster?
you're holding us prisoner in our own home.
I'm just as much a prisoner as you.
eggshell white. Bold lettering.
double embossed. I was Cole Pfeiffer.
respected businessman.
top salesman in the Northeast Region.
now I'm back being prisoner of my own identity.
theodore Bagwell. Convict.
to hell with it. We are who we are, right?
what were you selling?
never yomind.
you just pray your sist comes through.
the Company gets destroyed and we get paid.
it's a great deal.
this guy is just another General Krantz waiting to happen.
let's say we do sell it to him and the Company burns,
you know what happens then?
another company is built right on top of that one.
we're not selling.
sucre pulled it off.
great.
it's like an ultrasound.
it can see through everything.
you're building up a tolerance.
then we'll up the dosage.
Yeah, I have, and at this point, a higher dosage would have more side effects than the tumor itself.
I'll manage without it.
sit this one out.
let me and Sucre handle it.
I'm going.
why can't he understand I need to finish this?
everything that happened, it all started with the Company.
maybe not for Lincoln.
maybe for him, this all started with his little brother breaking him out of prison.
Michael, you saved his life.
if anything happens to you, he spends the rest of his life feeling guilty for that.
tell me something, at what point does a noble deed become fanaticism?
fanaticism is the only way to beat them.
en if it kills you?
self: Hey, pop the trunk.
sucre just sent a text. He's found Gretchen and Self.
good, good.
you all right?
Yeah, for now.
all right.
Linc? Yeah?
after your trial that day I came to see you at Fox River...
what about it?
I thought you did it.
I thought you killed Terrence Steadman.
along with everyone else.
but by the time I left, I...
I knew you were innocent.
and I had to get you out of that place.
so, however this plays out,
I have no regrets.
self: Scofield's hiding something in the washroom.
I think we just found our missing piece of scylla. Call vikan.
I want to talk to my daughter first
just call him, okay, they're fine.
I have a history with Vikan.
no money exchanges hands unless I tell him you're legit.
I want to talk to my daughter. Now!
yeah?
put the daughter on the phone.
is there a problem?
just put her on the phone.
Hello?
Emily, baby, it's your Auntie Gretchen.
where are you?
I'm not far. Are you okay?
there's this mean man here.
Emily, baby, do you remember the mean man that used to live with your mommy Rita?
the one that used to yell at you all the time?
that's the one.
and what happened to Roy?
he went to the store one day and never came back.
that's right.
and I think that if you don't like this mean man, then very soon, he's going to leave and he's never coming back.
you think so?
baby, I know so.
all right, that's enough.
Emily, baby, put the mean man back on the phone.
listen to me. I'm going to call you in two hours with the exact location of the exchange.
if you don't hear from me, kill them both.
you expecting somebody?
no.
look lively.
Hey, buttercup, why don't you go play with your dollsies or something.
it's okay, honey. Go to your playroom.
Hi, there.
my name is Ralph Becker, and I'm selling Bibles to raise money for the Church of the Holy Trinity.
and I wonder if I could spend five minutes of your time and talk about the Gospel with you.
we're a bit, uh, indisposed at the moment, Ralph.
can you come back tomorrow?
well, actually, today is the last day of the fund-raiser.
I said we're busy.
we're never too busy for God.
and what's a few minutes of your afternoon for a place in His kingdom?
you're a bit pushy for a Bible salesman, ain't you, friend?
I'm on a mission.
Yeah, that you're on a mission, right
what are you doing?! Close the door!
this guy is Company! What company?!
get me some rope to tie him up with.
this guy is a Bible salesman.
get the rope, now!
good choice for a meeting spot, Alex.
crowded place. Two exits.
corner table with a full view of the room.
looks like you're getting acclimated to life on the run.
I hear you got promoted.
your own field office, Wheeler.
that's impressive.
when you're neither a disgrace to the Bureau nor a drug addict, good things can happen.
he's clean, Mark.
thank you, Felicia.
look, I know you, Mark.
you're a good agent, ambitious.
so, let me appeal to the side of you that likes to see your name in print.
want to be on a short list for Deputy Director? Huh?
right. Lang filled me in.
you've got solid gold intel.
I don't know if I'm more skeptical of a burned out ex-Fed or the mythical cabal known as the Company.
you came all the way here for a myth?
what do yowant, Alex?
Felicia tells me you have the attorney general's ear.
that's right.
the Bureau is compromised.
homeland Security is compromised.
I ne someone I can tru. Can I trust you?
you get me credible intelligence against the company...
I'll walk you into the attorney general's office myself.
we'll get it.
Alex, talk to me.
I think I found someone in government we can trust.
how close are you to getting Scylla?
very. Michael...
we're inscrow here. You' ve got to come through with the house.
don't worry.
we're getting Scylla.
all right.
look what I found.
problem is, there's no way to shoot them.
Yeah, we do.
Michael: Sucre, go buy some hairspray and a lighter.
what's this?
my resignation.
Lisa, I tried to shield you from everything
I didn't think you could handle.
the only thing you shielded me from was knowing who you really are.
now I know.
I wanted a son.
ferguson: Sir...
taken less than an hour ago.
you were right-- Gretchen's with Self.
general: Your mission is the safe retrieval of Scylla.
ferguson Rules of engagement?
general: There are none. Shoot on sight.
Fauntleroy Hotel, downtown.
who send you?
the Churchf The Holyrini.
liar!
are you out of your mind?!
you're beating up a Bible salesman!
I ain't Scofield.
I ain't Burrows.
this ain't my lot! Leave me alone!
I'm not a part of the company - I don't know anything, I swear. - Look at him! Please, please, just look at him!
does he look like some kind of a undercover agent to you?
they blend in! That's how they get you!
he's got a California driver's license.
Ralph Becker," okay?
he's got a library card and a prayer card.
that is pretty convincing.
look at this.
freedom, Honor, Country.
southeastern Military Academy, Class of '98.
how many Bible salesman do you know graduate from a military academy?!
No! I didn't go to Southeastern! It's my kid brother's ring!
he died in Baghdad last year!
it was a car bomb!
I swear!
RITA: Listen to me.
that made sense.
okay...
that made sense.
BECKER: Please!
we're not going nowhere!
not till I get a phone call!
it's $25 for the hour.
we don't need a room.
I, uh, I'm looking for my sister.
her name's Gretchen Morgan.
can you tell me what room she's in?
you want information, call 411.
how about now?
no Gretchen Morgan. no refund
she's about five-seven.
she's got black hair and blue eyes, and I imagine she'd stand out in a fine establishment like this one.
room 308.
thank you so much.
no urinating in the stairwell.
that's the golden rule.
yeah?
Yeah, they're on the third floor, front of the hotel, just to the left of center.
got it, thanks.
Yeah.
third floor up, just left of the balcony.
why don't you set up on that rooftop over there?
Scylla's almost complete. Is everything ready on your end?
let me talk to Gretchen.
no, you'realking to me.
the buyer has touched down.
this isn't the kind of person you keep waiting.
likewise.
just make sure he has the money ready.
listen to me, you mook.
you're in the deep end of the pool now.
at least act like you can swim.
and the next time I call, I want to talk to Gretchen.
no, no, no, you listen to me, okay?
the next time you call, it better be to tell me that the money's ready, you understand?
hello.
I thought yoshould know a man and a woman came in looking for you.
Scofield found us. How?
who cares? Just get ready.
how long ago?
a couple of minutes.
I don't want no trouble in my place!
I'm gonna recon the hallway.
anything goes down, get Scylla, get out.
I will find you.
okay.
Michael, like I said before, this is just business.
ferguson: Don't move!
get in!
help me get him in the back of the van!
what is that?
yping) It's the warehouse.
you sure it's here? Yeah, I'm sure.
from the schematic, it can only be in one place.
look, don't be stupid, okay, Gretchen?
you're gonna get your daughter back and your money.
I'll see you in the car.
he was brought in like this.
who's there?
I'm giving him 10cc's of clonazepam and taking him downstairs. We'll know more soon.
try and relax.
don't worry, we're gonna get michael back.
how? Self took the piece We got nothing to trade for Michael.
Sara: He's sick, Lincoln.

we'll get him back, I promise.
hello.
hold on.
it's Alex.
Yeah.
did you get it yet?
no, Self's got it.
all of it.
what?
just forget about scylla. The Company's taken Michael.
your friend in government-- can he do anything for him?
no, I don't think so.
there's no reason for you to come back, Alex.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
should have known.
Vikan's meeting us here?
lbeff the Company's radar here.
Yeah.
we got a problem.
well, whatever it is, it can wait.

I'm going to call you back with the exact location of the exchange.
I'd love to, ut a, uh...
third party has been introduced into the mix.
who?
I'm not sure yet.
he might be a Company operative.
so kill him.
he could also be a Bible salesman.
then he should have no problem getting past St. Peter. Kill him.

go now!
please... please, please don't kill me.
please don'till me.
I won't tell anyone, I promise!

our Father who art in Heaven hallowed be thy name...
you want to be free?

right this minute.
if you pull that trigger...
Cole Pfeiffer is gone forever.
don't do this.
don't do this.
you kn, my daddy was a religious man, too, Ralph, just like you.
we used to... pray together in my room at night.
I used to go down to the floor crying just like you now.
sometimes when I just couldn't take it no more, my daddy would recite a particul ar piece of Scripture that he was fond of...
weeping may endure through the night...
but joy cometh in the morning.
psalms 30: 5.
yeah?
have you got a car?
my car's in the... it's in the garage.
you get in that car right now and you drive far, far away from right here, right now, okay?
here.
thank you.
what are you going to do to me?
I want you to go.
I want you to be free.
be as free as me.
thank you.
thank you so much.
Yeah, I got one.
not Gretchen. It's Bagwell.
I'm bringing h im in.
it's pushing up against his temporal lobe and it will kill him if it's not removed.
have you seen anything like this before?
this advanced?
once.
sir...
you'll never guess who just came through the door.
I want to see my brother.
thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. Burrows, won't be a problem...
will you?
this started with me. It ends with me Let Michael go
I think you made the right decision.
let's go downstairs and see your brother.
don... this better be the real thing this time.
it's all here.
well, no offense, but I'll check it myself.
so the buyer's on the way?
he will be here shortly.
and he's bringing the money?
Yes, Don, he is bringing the money.
Scylla is complete.
Gretchen, you did it.
what I wouldn't give to see the look on the General's face.
what the hell are you doing?!
we need him alive to sell this thing!
you heard what he said.
buyer's already on the way.
you think I'm going to give this clown 30%
for just making introductions?
BECKER: It's the one with the glass door in front.
okay, we're coming out.
the attorney general is willing to hear you out.
you know, from where I'm sitting, it looked like...
your flight to Dulles leaves in 45 minutes.
can I trust this guy?
we better go.
come on, alex, short trip to the airport.
attorney general's waiting.
with the attorney general, is there?
: thank you, Felicia.
for everything you've done.
everything.
what did you do to my brother?
general: Michael needs an operation to remove a tumor from his temporal lobe, and he needs it now.
the Company can provide such an operation at a cost.
what do you want frous?
not "us," Link...
you.
the price of the operation is the safe return of Scylla.
you bring back to me what you stole, and I will make sure Michael gets the finest medical care in the world
the Company has science and technology that's years ahead of anything available to the public.
and it's all right here
in this facility.
now I would imagine that working for me would be difficult for you to accept.
what's this?
added incentive.
the price of the operation is the safe return of Scylla.
see if the buyer left him a message.
Yeah, it's a Miami area code.
the item.
I'm sure you understand no one can know where Scylla's going.
do you know who took it?
no, but Self and Gretchen do.
then you've got your team. - I'm not working for them.
what happened?
he got away.
what's this?
my resignation.
whatever plan you're working on to get us out of here, we better make a move on it.
you're not getting out of here, Michael.
I made a deal.
your life in exchange for Scylla.
you think you can do that knowing what you know about the Company?
you want to know what I know about the Company?
mom worked for them before she died.
now, I'm gonna do everything and anything I can to end this.
Hello?
Sara, it's me.
where are you?
Miami. The guy who took Scylla's here.
so you're-you're actually trying to get it back for the Company?
I'm gonna give it back to the Company so we can walk away from this.
how's Michael?
I don't know. I don't know.
two guys from the Company came, and they brought me to a hotel, and-and I was given flowers and a fruit basket, and absolutely no information about Michael.
is Fernando with you?
sucre split.
we, uh, we left some messages with Mahone, telling him where we are, but that was two cell phones back.
sorry, who's "we"? Who are you with?
people I don't trust.
okay. Listen, um...
lincoln, I know why you did it, and-and...
I'm grateful to you, because he was gonna die.
but do you really think that they're just gonna let us live when we give them Scylla?
you know what, Sara, I'm doing my best.
just-just call me if you hear anything about Michael, please.
Linc, the Company's data tech finally got a hit on our guy's cell phone.
it's a number, and it goes to this address-- The Grafton; it's a club.
how many calls? - Three. All outgoing.
how do we know this guy's still in Miami, that he hasn't sold it already, huh?
not that I'm complaing.
I've had some filthy, filthy times in this state.
don't screw this up, all right?
because that's our only lead on this guy.
be thankful I haven't killed you.
Oh, yeah? Wh-What are you, Eliot Ness now?
what, are you upset because I screwed you over, Linc?
cause don't act like you haven't done that to ten times as many people. All right?
we're just crooks that got caught, Lincoln.
this... this guy, this isn't gonna work.
why don't we all just focus on who's got Scylla.
what do you say?
Hey, Scofield.
where am I?
he's awake. - I said, where am I?
it's a house, in the woods, 60 miles from anywhere.
swept clean of weapons, so you don't need to worry your head about that.
there are no bars on the windows or the doors, but there are three types of mountain lion in the area, so you might want to stay close by.
I'll take it from here.
Dr. Roger Knowlton, Michael. How are you feeling?
you some kind of neurologist?
psychiatrist.
given that you've got some free time, the General asked if I'd sit with you.
a cigar's a cigar. Are we done?
you've been operating under some...
misconceptions about the Company, and the General wants to, uh, open the books.
I'm here to...
provide facts and to help you process them.
if by facts, you mean what's on Scylla and that my mother once worked for the Company,
I already know these things.
"Worked"?
your mother... worksfor us.
your mother is alive.
we don't open till 3: 00.
I'm just looking for someone.
haven't got the guy's name, uh, but he called here yesterday about three times
new Yorker, dark hair, bits of gray.
you know where I can find him?
uh, yeah, I can't help you. Sorry.
you sure?
my man, you need to check your ears, all right,'cause he just said we don't know who you're talking about.
is that right? - Yeah, that's right.
well, what about blondie?
you've got about two seconds...
how about it?
I don't know his name. - How about it!
he works... this girl... works here, he dates her.
you're gonna take me to her.
well, this is all just.
fascinating, Doctor.
I don't know how better to say this.
she left you and your brother to protect you.
from the dangers of solar synthesis work?
I know what's on Scylla.
there were threats, you and Lincoln might be kidnapped.
you were in imminent danger. - Really.
where was she when my brother was strapped to an electric chair?
she'd been working in a Madagascar rain forest, without satellite access.
or she wasn't alive, hasn't been for 25 years, and this is all fiction.
there's a million acres, corn and soy, outside Cordoba that was arid scrub before your mother's research.
that's not fiction, that's food...
for thousands. Millions.
there's so much more on Scylla than you know.
it sounds like we'd have a lot to talk about.
why don't you get her on the phone.
when you're ready.
no time like the present.
when you're ready... to join her.
us.
that's... what this conversation is about.
Joing... the Company.
Hey, Erica, it's me.
so, are you coming?
I really need to talk to you.
she's on her way.
be there in 1 min
Oh, my God!
why'd this guy call the club's phone and not Erica's?
I... They fight a lot, so when she doesn't answer, he calls the club.
what do you want with this guy?
he took something that belongs to me. I want it back.
there. There's Erica.
wait here.
get him stitched up.
big guy. Shaved head. Crazy.
who the hell is he? - I don't know.
he bought the whole thing about you being friends with this chick or whatever?
Yeah.
he didn't know I was with you, and by the time he did, he was trying not to get shot.
you did good.
I just need a smoke so bad.
Oh, no. - What?
my wallet.
this is the chick who set me up.
we find her, we find our guy.
busting up clubs, firing shots in public.
you keep that up and we're not going to last here much longer.
I don't plan on staying here very long. You?
see, that's why I have to give it up to the General.
he puts four enemies together, guaranteed dissension.
no alliances form against him.
this is our guy's girlfriend's address.
he's probably gone, but see what you can find.
this is Tia.
do you want to know what I think they were talking about?
I don't care.
just as long as they keep out of my way.
same with you.
send her in.
Sarah! You're looking... rested.
how is the hotel?
I would like to offer my professional assistance in Michael's rehabilitation.
kind...
but he's receiving excellent care.
there's nothing for you to worry about.
whatever it is you have planned for him, I would simply like to help maintain his health.
and that's appreciated, but it's impossible.
believe me, you serve Michael best at a distance right now.
trust me.
I have no agenda apart from simply wanting to see that he's okay.
and in three days to a week, he'll be back in your loving arms forever.
okay, I'm not that patient.
indulge yourself.
sit by the pool, envision the future: financial security,
Michael's talents being utilized on a global scale, you beside him innovating.
Michael's talents being utilized on a global scale?
I'm simply trying to maximize his potential.
yours, too.
what's being done to him?
I'm putting an end to this exhausting cat-and-mouse.
thank you for stopping by.
radical architecture is a rejection of all formal and moral parameters from your thesis.
someone else's words heavily paraphrased.
and it pertains to buildings, structures.
I think you meant it as a metaphor.
what, that the ends justify the means?
which neatly coincides with your mother's philosophy.
did you know that she had an almost identical quote in her thesis from 30 years ago?
you've done a lot of homework.
just a few conversations.
let me guess.
you two had some kind of moment at the Company Christmas party?
I've known your mother for years.
well enough to know you've got the same brilliant mind and the same sense of humor, for that matter.
I'm guessing this isn't about my sense of humor.
she was just as resistant to joining the Company, but then she learned the truth.
if the truth is that the Company is all about saving the world, I don't buy it.
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the Company, what do you want with me?
a fully functioning Scylla project would exist on a global scale.
it can't be managed by one person.
but two...
equally formidable, working in lockstep?
Absolutely.
that's very good.
you've clearly thought of everything.
if I weren't telling you the truth, how would I have gotten this?
5416 Grand St. 1 Hour
this is just a stupid girl who dates a criminal.
this is a waste of time.
a signature of Burrows' leadership.
all right, we need to make a shift.
Bagwell, I'm telling you right now, if I make my play and you go soft,
I will sail you off that loft balcony and no one will bat an eye.
my aim is true, Don. Keep it in your pants.
I'll keep it in my pants, all right?
all right, all in favor of changing the regime, say "Aye."
aye, aye, Captain. -Aye.
all right, Burrows is out.
good, great. Send it.
the Company's e-mailing Tia's credit card history.
you know, I'm thinking more and more that this is an inside job.
Why?
a couple reasons.
the hardware he brought to the meet.
he could read Scylla right on the spot.
since he's disappeared, I should be able to find this man, and I can't.
people you can't find are usually Company.
how does that change anything?
it doesn't. It just makes everything harder.
Lincoln... -Yeah?
when are we going to get this out of the way?
what?
of all the mercenary humps I've thrown at guys in my lifetime,
I think I'm due for one I want.
don't flatter yourself.
too late.
name it.
and I do mean anything.
a big of fat load of nothin'!
a big of goose egg.
nothing.
old address books, photographs, hard drive from her computer.
I checked her e-mails and her Web sites. There's nothing from our guy.
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here?
because this is starting to feel like a wasted trip.
how long is it gonna take the Company to pull everything off this thing?
a couple hours.
all right, Linc, this is the deal.
look, we appreciate your effort, but Bagwell and I took a vote, and this being Florida and all, you came up a little bit short.
Meaning? -You're not in charge.
who is? -Him.
Yeah. The bull-in-the-china- shop routine might have worked when you were stealing gumballs, but our asses are on the line now, okay?
and we all have deals with the General.
so that's the way it's gonna be.
and if you notice, even Gretchen hasn't leapt to your defense.
Linc, just let him wear his crown.
I would if I thought he wasn't gonna sell this thing.
Oh, what, am I the only one who's thought about that?
look, here's the deal, Linc. At some point, you'll have a vote.
but until then, you're done, all right? We're shuttin' you down, okay?
you're no longer in charge.
Uh-oh, looks like there's been a recount.
bad time? -No, perfect.
the second you stop doing what I tell you to do,
I'm gonna blow your brains out.
bring her back.
it's not gonna be the same.
stir any memories?
I was ten. We were on a camping trip in Jackson Hole.
fishing, hiking.
family huddled under a blanket in front of the bonfire.
you can stop now. -Why?
because two years later it was gone?
you know, three of the four people in this photograph are still alive.
so what are you suggesting, grab my fishing pole?
time for a... a family reunion in Wyoming?
or wherever you like.
don't tell me it's something you haven't wished for.
I wished for a lot of unrealistic things.
I got over them, too.
why, when we can make this happen?
these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time.
before you were incarcerated, you'd go to visit her grave on the anniversary of her funeral.
all right, enough. -You'd bring a bouquet of blue irises.
you'd sit for an hour. -I said stop it.
when you'd leave, you'd take a flower and pin it to your lapel.
she watched you do this every year.
she's seen the pain you carry. She wants to make amends.
all right!
so you did a little digging. Good for you.
but everything out of your mouth is a lie, and I don't believe a word of it.
so let's just stop.
let's just stop.
that's Tia's address right there. Pull it up.
all right, she lives here, works here, but yesterday she used her credit card to buy a drink at the Pelican Club a little after noon, and then she picked up something at the gift shop a little after 1: 00.
waiting for her boyfriend to debark.
disembark.
he's already in town. -Yeah.
then he lives in the Marina.
or this is another reason to think it's an inside job.
if he's working with someone from the Company, they wouldn't want their names on any flight manifests.
all right, they're trying to get Scylla out of the country by boat undetected.
let's go.
Alex, Yeah?
thanks for coming when you did, man.
you helped me like you said you would.
I owe you.
okay, I'll do the talking.
you guys wait here. Alex, let's go.
afternoon.
how's it going? -What can I do you for?
recognize her? Her name's Tia Hayden.
can't say I do. Wish I did.
nice little tomato there.
she was in here yesterday with a man.
can't help. Sorry.
don Self, Homeland Security.
and this is my partner Bruce Liberace.
no relation.
our department is working with the Office of Foreign Assets Control.
have you heard of them?
Yep. -Bet you have.
we're looking into smuggling and contraband transportation of Cuban cigars.
none here, swear to God.
all right, well, that's for us to decide.
it's going to take about a week, and it's going to involve shutting down this entire marina...
Oh, yeah. -For about a week.
or... -She was here with that guy you were talking about.
he wanted to know which berth a private charter was docking in.
he asked me to move it further down the dock, which I did.
further away from the Coast Guard slip?
I didn't ask. And I didn't accept any money.
if he said he paid me, he's lying.
what's the point of departure?
nassau, Bahamas. Round trip.
when does it arrive? -Arrived.
Hey, everybody!
okay, my name is Don Self! Homeland Security.
my colleagues and I are hoping that you guys have a wonderful and safe trip.
unfortunately, we're going to have to do a quick luggage check search.
shouldn't take more than a minute, folks.
your cooperation is all that's required.
open your bags.
get on your knees!
okay, okay, okay.
where is it? Where's Scylla?
what have you got in here?
three joints.
I'm on probation.
is this going to send me back?
make yourself a helmet, pal.
just like old times.
bring her back.
you know I can't do that.
but, look, there's some stuff that I can do.
it's not going to be the same, but we're going to figure it out.
and, no matter what, it's still going to be me and you.
I am thrilled that you're enjoying your trip to the mountains, but it's not an open-ended vacation.
Scofield's exhausted.
despondent.
he's very resistant, but a classic abandoned child. He'll come around.
time frame, Doctor?
unaided, three days.
with the pentothal?
sooner, but it's nearly a chemical lobotomy.
but, if he turns on his own, it'll be his decision, his reasoning.
we'll own him forever.
Scofield's squirrelly.
I won't trust him till he walks hot coals.
I think I can get him there. -Good.
but, if I find out he's been playing you, Doctor, you'll get the same lobotomy as Scofield.
just get it done.
go!
Hello, I'm a Mac.
if you fight when those cuffs are off, the guards will stomp the life out of you.
Yeah.
forgive the dramatics. The Company can't know I'm talking to you.
you are the Company. You're his daughter.
do you want to find Michael Scofield? -Of course I do.
it's 60 miles northeast of downtown. I'd move quickly.
what are they doing to him? -Having lemonade.
they're carving out his personality. That's how they recruit.
or you're setting me up.
clandestine warfare isn't pretty, but the rules of engagement don't include killing and torturing the innocent.
at least not for me.
michael is the object of a quick and nasty process, and you're wasting time.
out.
out.
we need the footage from that security camera.
not to offend either of you, but I took the liberty of calling my attorney to find out exactly what the scope of your authority is here, and he tells me...
just get the tape, all right?
either we missed Scylla... -No, no, no. We did not miss Scylla.
we searched every bag.
then maybe the buyer was already on the boat, and was disembarking, right?
I mean, if they don't want their names on any flight manifest, maybe they just eased back on in.
that wouldn't be the worst news.
that means they're in Miami. -Right.
so get yourself back down with your disgraced badge to Steamboat Willie, and have him cough up every name of every person on that boat coming off.
okay, that's good, because they probably would have traveled in on a low-grade charter from the Bahamas, and used their real names, right?
that would be a good plan.
how is he? -He's alive.
so we get Scylla.
then we're free, all of us-- Pam, LJ...
all of a sudden, the Company grew a heart?
they're just tired of us. They want Scylla back. That's it.
then we never really had anything they wanted. -Exactly.
now we got leverage.
we don't have it yet.
anything?- No.
nothing yet. Nothing.
no, Lincoln, you don't understand.
the way she said "recruit" made my stomach turn.
they're going to torture him.
he can take care of himself, at least for one day, until we get Scylla.
lincoln, he needs to be in the ICU.
what's your plan? Break him out?
I don't know. I don't have one.
well, you're putting him and us at risk.
just stay in the hotel until we get back to L. A.All right?
yes?
Tancredi got the location of her shining knight.
she may be heading there now.
exemplary, Bagwell.
thank you, Sir.
a deal's a deal, right?
not to be a broken record, but all I ask...
but I think we're making some real progress, General.
the Scofield/Burrows family would have been a formidable asset to the Company, but since his lapdog insists on complicating matters, we move on.
general, we can handle a lone female.
if, indeed, that's what we're dealing with.
but it's my experience, that with the one comes many.
do it now, Doctor.
I need an hour.
he just ate. I don't want him to aspirate.
now, Doctor.
I want Scofield pliable for transit.
your vehicle arrives in 20 minutes.
and if we can't revive him?
Michael, come out.
we need to talk.
think of something.
that's it! That's our guy!
there's Tia right beside him.
we've got to pull that image, get it to the Company, and have them match it.
Where's Gretchen?
how'd you find me?
once I found your mug shot, it really wasn't that hard getting your legit cell number.
well, now I'm here. What do you want?
you never bothered to ask back in Los Angeles
you were too busy planning on killing me
but I actually worked for the Company.
I know who you are.
and I'll ask it again.
what do you want?
to solve your problems, Scott.
I mean, it is what gets me up out of bed in the morning.
you have a big problem, and so does whoever it is you're working for.
and you obviously know that or you wouldn't have graced me with your presence.
and you can make that problem disappear?
quickly and completely.
with an extra added bonus.
crucial, I might add.
I then feed the Company a story that has them looking elsewhere.
meaning you're invaluable and please don't kill you.
Yeah.
without the "please."
how much?- A lot.
and it's about to double here in a second if you don't look at me when I'm talking to you.
you go run and talk it over with your boss.
call me with a number.
I'm authorized to negotiate on their behalf.
if you serve up whoever's looking for us and get the Company off our scent
$10 million.
best and final offer.
ask for a penny more and I'll shoot you in the chest and take my chances.
take it easy, Michael.
this...Is for your own good.
what was that?
sounded like the water heater.
came from the bathroom.
pick it up!
now give the doctor his medicine.
no.
bedpost.
in here, in the bedroom.
come on!
uncuff me now!
that's great.
thank you. Perfect.
let me know if you hear anything else.
where the hell you been?
figuring this whole thing out.
I know who it is. The buyer.
his name is lawrence wilcott and he's working for the company for ten years.
how did you figure that out?
I still have friends on the inside, and on the outside of the company.
I've been putting together a profile, narrowing down the candidates.
wilcott got on a plane in Bogot and flew to the Bahamas yesterday and then got on a boat.
the guy who took scylla off us in L. A?
we pulled his image off the security tape.
company's running a recognition match right now.
that's great, but that's going to take all day.
do you know wher he is right now?
with wilcott. We need to go now.
because better yet, I know where wilcott's staying.
okay, we need to move before scylla does.
let's go. Let's go.
turn around!
punch it, we gotta get out of here!
Michael, get in!
he's rented out the entire top floor.
security at every point.
we might want to get to an employee-- bribe 'em.
top level company in a big glass building.
nice and slow.
get your hands up.
this is everyone?
you whore.
you're a whore, and your mother waore, a wh and her mother, and your father used to turn tricks at a gas station, 'cause he was a whore, too.
Bye, tie.
sorry, but right now I want my life back more than I want your money.
Where's scylla?
well, let's talk about that, okay?
let's. Where is it?
I can get it.
no, he can't.
he's stalling, Linc.
it's gone.- You're right.
and since all you guys can kiss my ass, there's only one thing I want to accomplish right now.
lawrence wilcott? The whole floor of the hotel rented out?
made it up.
you have no idea who this guy was working for?
no clue.
we gotta pull the pin here, guys.
just because she switched sides at the last second doesn't mean she wasn't going to kill us two minutes ago, okay?
kill her.
all right, we're not leaving her here for the cops and we're not taking her to the hospital.
Why?
I didn't let you get slaughtered.
she's got a kid.- So what?
are we killing the kid?
the kid doesn't even know it's her mother.
come on, Linc, pull the trigger. Do it.
her name's Emily-- she's only eight years old. Come on.
do it.
we're not them.
you keep your mouth shut, and you get to see your kid in visitation.
I know what the general will do to me for talking.
believe me. I know him well.
are you serious?
let's go, let's go.
what happened?
you haven't said a word.
I think my mother's alive.
that's his cell phone. Answer it.
hello. Hello.
your boy's dead.
and now I'm coming after you.
did you hear me?
whoever you are, I'm coming after you.
who was that?
it was my son
when were you planning on telling me that your mother was behind you on this?
you have today, one day.
when Burrows brings Scylla back to us, you will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.
the son of Prime Minister Nandu Banerjee.
soon, this will all be behind us, and maybe I can meet my grandson.
Where's Linc?!
there's an energy conference.
the Panda Bay Hotel. He'll be there.
Christina's plan... what she needed to profit from Scylla, an incident that'll domino into global warming.
No!
they rented this in Linc's name.
look at this. It's a setup!
his hands are all over the shells.
lincoln's right back where he started.
it really is too bad about Michael.
we gotta go.
I need a doctor here!
there they are!
they're up there! They're up there!
let's go upstairs, now!
move it, move it!
look, let's just blend into the crowd.
no, we can't go that way.
the door is locked, Michael.
stand back.
down here move!
this whole thing is falling apart.
is it?
is it really?
what, do you think this is funny? Huh?
how long you think it's gonna take before the General sees this on the news?
if he thinks we can't get Scylla, how long do you think it's gonna take before he comes after us?
and then he comes after our families?
Yeah, it's really funny, isn't it?
Michael, where are you?
we're still in the hotel.
is there any other way to get out of here without being seen?
no, there's cops and feds all over the place.
did you get Scylla?
no.
some guy got assassinated.
and guess who got set up for it.
we need Scylla.
Scylla is gone!
the only thing I care about right now is getting out of here.
Oh, yeah? Where you gonna go, Michael, huh?
with the Company breathing down our back again.
Scofield, it's Don.
what do you want?
to try to fix this.
how?
by stabbing us in the back again?
put Alex on.
he's a little preoccupied right now.
look, you want to be mad at me, be mad at me after we get Scylla back.
now listen to me.
okay, the southwest loading dock is a large industrial door.
it's not conducive to a quick exit.
they only have one cop on it.
when you get to the door, I can incapacitate the cop.
problem is, we're on the other side of the hotel, and they've got the ground floor covered.
what else can you see on the outside?
nothing, just the cop, a couple of Dumpsters, jack pallets and some laundry bins.
that must mean the on-site laundry's on the other side of the hotel, near the loading dock door.
if we get to the laundry, we can get to the door.
you said we can't make it across the hotel.
but we can get access to the roof.
hotels use rooftop ventilation, so the hotel guests don't smell the laundry fumes.
okay, so, listen, take the ventilation system to the laundry room;
if you can get to the laundry room, you're gonna get right by the door.
put me on speaker.
Alex, you want to get The Company off our backs?
go to 4 Dunn Place.
Sara's holding my mother there.
make her tell us where Scylla is.
and clear our names in all this.
Mahone, you need to do whatever you gotta do to get her to talk, you hear me?
do whatever you gotta do.
got it.
come on.
it is complete mayhem at the Panda Bay Hotel where Naveen Banerjee, the son of India's Prime Minister, has been assassinated.
amazingly, there have been unconfirmed reports identifying the assailants as none other than Lincoln Burrows, the man who'd been suspected of murdering Terrence Steadman, and Michael Scofield, his mastermind brother...
Christina sandbagged all of us!
if the brothers are caught, we have no control over what they might say to the authorities.
get down to that hotel and make sure they don't have that opportunity.
uh, General, I'd be more than willing to take on that assignment.
and I assure you I will dispatch of it efficiently.
this is not an Alabama coon hunt, Teddy.
don't judge me by desperate actions I've taken when there's been a gun to my head.
I ran an entire prison gang syndicate.
hardened felons called me "Mister."
I'm so much more than a snitch.
and if you continue to treat me as such, it will be your loss, General, not mine.
son, I have the fate of a multi-trillion dollar enterprise in my hands, and you want me to let you earn your stripes now?!
take care of the brothers.
here we go! Here we go!
this should be it.
perfect.
they say ours should be here shortly.
I want you guys on full alert and get all geared up, all right?
it's them!
stop!
they could be on any floor.
can you override the door locks?
Yeah, they're electronic.
we control everything from down here.
I want every room in this hotel locked down now!
why don't we just take the stairs to the roof?
because we'll set off the fire alarm.
the ducts in the crawl spaces above these top floor rooms, that's how we get our rooftop access.
once we find the laundry vent, we take that down to the loading dock.
that should do it.
go! Go!
what's going on?
they locked us out.
we can't get to the roof.
let's head back down.
there'll be cops in the stairwell.
we can't go up, we can't go down...
we're trapped.
there has been a new development in the Panda Bay assassination.
an anonymous source has provided FOX with documents showing a wire transfer from Chinese operatives to Burrows and Scofield.
the fallout from this from a geopolitical standpoint is staggering.
relations between China and India...
Nandu reached out.
he wants to meet with you.
this couldn't have worked out better.
nice audible on the Chinese document.
thank you.
now we just...
watch the dominoes begin to fall.
I just wish they weren't falling on Michael.
Christina, you gave him options, he made his choice, he picked his side.
Yes, but he is my son.
my only son.
and right now it is believed both Burrows and Scofield are still in the hotel, but it appears the police are closing in.
live just outside the Panda Bay Hotel...
no, no, no, you see, that's the problem, Michael.
there's cops everywhere.
it's like a freaking cop anthill out here.
look, it's just a matter of time till they find you anyway.
find out what their plan of attack is.
sure, you know what?
Yeah, I'll just go up and ask them, all right?
they look like a real friendly bunch.
we don't have much time, so get it done now!
Burrows and Scofield could be armed to the teeth.
it's tight quarters in the stairwell, so I don't want a lot of shooting, all right?
this guy's from Homeland Security.
I'll file my report as soon as I've apprehended the shooters.
whoa, whoa, let me be clear here, Captain.
the shooting that happened today wasn't your typical gangbanger, public service killing you're used to here in Miami.
this was an international assassination with ramifications that directly affect the security of this country.
so, if you turn your back on me again,
I'll jam you up for hindering a federal investigation.
you understand?
fine.
but I want you on my hip.
I'm not gonna have you running around playing weekend warrior so you can go back to your buddies at the office and tell them you saw some real gun play, understood?
not a problem.
now, why don't you start by telling me how you're gonna diffuse the situation?
we're gonna gas them out floor by floor until we find them.
whoa, hold on there, Tex. If you use gas you're gonna compromise visibility and I can't afford another diplomat getting shot in the fez.
we're using chloropropane.
it's colorless, it's odorless.
they won't even know what hit them.
all right, listen up.
I want two men in the east stairwell with the gas, two at the base of the west stairwell in case they try to come back down again.
I'll have backup detail ready, all right?
let's go, move, move!
Oh, my God.
come on Sara, you hurt? You okay?
I'm fine. Christina's gone.
there's a knife in the last drawer.
do you have any idea where she went?
no.
she has Scylla.
she set up Linc and Michael.
she could be anywhere.
michael and Lincoln?
Yeah, they were framed for the murder of an Indian official.
it's all over the news.
that was Christina's plan, and...
where are they now?
they're trapped at the Panda Bay Hotel.
the police are looking for them.
okay.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go there.
the cops are everywhere. I really need you to get out of my way.
well, that's not gonna happen.
you don't care for me, I don't care for you much either, but I owe Michael, okay? Run.
he's in a sea of trouble right now. I'm not abandoning him.
I'm not telling you to abandon him. There's nothing you can do for him.
listen, I'd run if I could run.
but if I run, they go after my wife, so I have to jump back in.
you don't.
I'm not running.
I'll stay here, okay?
that way, Michael knows where I am.
so does Christina.
if she wanted me dead, I would be already.
suit yourself.
Thanks.
and if you see Michael, tell him I'm here.
Yeah.
I know how difficult this must be for you.
Mr. Prime Minister, I, too, lost a son when he was just a child.
was your son murdered by an assailant's bullet?
of course not.
I've heard the news that the Chinese are behind this.
Yes, I've heard that as well.
and that's why I'm here.
not to discuss how my son died, but how to avenge him.
your technology-- as you put it
I've heard rumors of its varied applications.
Nandu, let's take a breath here.
No! The time to take a breath expired when my son died.
your son and I had planned to use the technology for humanitarian endeavors.
warfare applications were not our goal.
but now they are mine, and at the end of the day, you're a businesswoman with a product and I am a buyer.
I want to commit to all the intellectual property you possess.
I want the People's Republic of China to feel the pain I feel right now!
do you comprehend the ramifications of what it is you're proposing?
more than you know.
if it is what you want.
I must go now...
to make arrangements for your payment and arrangements for my child's burial.
yeah?
Congratulations. You're famous again.
you're all over the news for killing Gandhi.
I figured as much.
Yeah, well, it gets worse.
they're gonna gas you out. When?
they already started. They're going floor-by-floor.
they're about at the third or fourth floor right now.
why are you just telling me about this now?
I had to leave the lobby.
I can't make anybody more suspicious.
Hello, Michael? Michael?
Linc, I need your help.
when I was in fourth grade,
I... I got an A for guessing all the answers on this test.
I never thought I'd beat those odds.
what kind of loser gets set up for two high-profile assassinations within five years?
are you kidding? This is not your fault.
if they didn't get away with it then, they're not gonna get away with it now.
but I need you to focus.
I need your help, Linc.
right. Let's get out of here.
Darrin Hooks, Homeland Security.
can you point me to whoever's in charge here?
homeland? How many of you guys are they sending here?
agent Self's already inside.
who?
agent Don Self.
got here a little while ago.
Yeah, it's Hooks.
the name of that agent that was supposedly killed recently in L. A?
was his name Don Self?
it's all falling out exactly as Christina planned it.
now she's going to have everything she ever hoped for.
she's trying to reignite the 1962 China-India Border War which ended in an uneasy truce when neither country could withstand the losses they were sustaining in those remote and desolate mountains.
if she succeeds in provoking another war, and framing China for the killing of India's Prime Minister's son, it's certainly provocation enough.
she'll set off a military conflict that will last for decades that may never be resolved.
why didn't you do it yourself?
power, money, seem to be things you love.
because if India's involved, that drags in Pakistan.
then Russia's gonna want to defend its borders.
then within a year, Europe's in it and after that, the United States.
it's an apocalypse in which everyone loses!
and Christina has always been too prideful and too unstable to accept it.
got it.
can I help you?
Hi. Yes, I think you can.
agent Self.
agent Darrin Hooks.
it's good to see you.
it's good to see you, too.
hold it. Hold it right there. Don't move.
what the hell are you doing, Hooks?
you always pull guns on fellow agents?
Yeah, when agents that are supposedly dead and are found later in a hotel with the guys that killed him.
you mind telling me what you're doing here with Burrows and Scofield?
my cover called for me to be dead, okay?
people were catching on to what we were doing, and my death freed me up
but Burrows and Scofield have been set up, okay?
there's no record of you in covert ops.
that was by design.
look, when this is all over, we'll call the home office,
I'll punch in my clearance code, you can buy me a couple of drinks, and we'll share some laughs about this.
but right now I need to do my damn job.
no.
you're gonna follow and we're gonna clear this up right now.
okay, but what I said about Scofield and Burrows is true.
they've been set up.
you need to look into this.
Oh, I'm gonna look into everything as soon as we get outside.
let's go.
did you clear the loading dock doors?
no, but someone else did.
what do you mean?
someone must've taken him out.
which means there's someone in the hotel other than the police that's looking for you.
we got to move.
got more than just the cops after us now.
whoa, whoa. You know what you're doing?
no.
let's go.
captain Hutchinson!
we've got a room breach on 16.
this is Hutchinson.
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.
I repeat, Scofield and Burrows are on 16.
move, move, move!
this way.
make sure the door can shut.
we need the pressure to build.
they're coming. They're coming!
we're on 16.
copy that.
on my mark.
go.
backup detail!
move! Go, go, go, go!
move, move, move! Go, move!
move, move!
what the hell happened?
they booby-trapped us.
they made a move for the roof.
all right, get them to a hospital.
all right. Let's go! Move, move, move!
stop right there!
don't make a move for that weapon, Burrows.
take the masks off.
take them off now!
hands behind your head.
you'd better pray to God that my men are found out all right.
it was a concussive blast.
they're just unconscious.
shut up.
easy!
easy.
and I'd follow that advice about not going for your guns.
the General would like you back at the office.
now.
did all go well at the hotel?
what's going on with Sara and my mother?
Christina escaped.
Sara's okay.
she's in the condo.
excuse me, would you boys like a little alone time to catch up?
what exactly do you expect from us?
you need to take responsibility for your failures.
Hey, we failed nothing.
this whole thing was a setup.
you know it. Lincoln Burrows was outsmarted.
who could have anticipated that?
I think you need to accept that this is over.
I've been holding a chip for far too long.
it's time to play it.
I made you boys a promise.
you would find Scylla and I would see to it you got some cash and had the slate wiped clean.
I intend to keep that promise.
however, if I keep one promise,
I have to keep them all.
now...
I wonder who the big winner will be.
don't do this. Don't do what?
when I sent you those envelopes, I wasn't just playing games.
I made it very clear that you had one day to accomplish your job, or there would be consequences.
what's that?
the consequence.
call our man in Queens.
Queens? What are you calling New York for?
put it on speaker, please.
Yes. Move on subject four.
I'm a block away.
ETA is less than two minutes.
you son of a bitch.
you son of a bitch!
my wife is a defenseless woman.
Mr. Self didn't inform you that he had a wife, did he?
well, I wouldn't talk about my wife either if I'd had a few too many bourbons, got behind the wheel, and turned a beautiful young woman into a piece of broccoli.
don't do anything.
I assume that is why you tried to run away with Scylla?
to screw a government that was giving you benefits that would only pay for a county facility overlooking the Belt Parkway, and to sell it so that you and she could disappear and be hidden forever.
I have the subject in sights.
she's in a wheelchair under a tree in the hospital courtyard.
do I have a go?
please don't do this.
okay, please, you can kill me, okay, you can kill me right now, please, kill me.
you don't need to do this; we'll get Scylla.
that's what I wanted to hear. Well, that's what we're trying to do!
we're getting it. But you have to know what awaits you and your loved ones if you don't.
we understand, okay?
execute the order. Please don't do it!
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
get help, hel--!
I believe you made a request.
Bagwell, make sure he's dead.
does everyone understand now?
are we all on the same page?
good.
let's get down to business.
three-quarters of a billion dollars in a numerical account in Luxembourg.
if you are still worried about humanitarian efforts, write a check to UNICEF.
all the data will be delivered within 24 hours.
that's what I expected.
you played it perfectly.
reach out to our contact in China.
I have a feeling they may be interested in what we're selling as well.
Christina, I don't advise playing both sides of this coin.
reach out to China.
No! Keep our people at every private airfield in Florida and in Georgia.
we can't have Christina leaving the state.
she played on India's emotions, which probably means she'd want to meet with one of their emissaries today while they're still running hot.
she could still be in Miami, maybe at the embassy.
no, she's not at the embassy.
any deal she makes with India will be strictly off the radar.
right now she's concerned with two things.
one is closing the deal on Scylla, which I'm assuming she's already done, and the second is getting paid.
no sign of Self.
how much can she get for Scylla?
half a billion from India, the same from China.
overseas account?
foreign wire transfer?
I doubt she's taking any food stamps.
she's going to want confirmation that that money is safely overseas before she leaves the U. S.
we find the money, we find my mother.
normally it takes three business days for an international wire transfer to clear, unless the bank is a Federal Reserve signatory, in which case the transfer is immediate.
you think she'll head to the bank?
all she has to do is withdraw a few grand from the millions that that buyer has probably transferred overseas already.
she'll know it's all there.
so let's find a Federal Reserve signatory bank in Miami.
we'll have a shot at finding her.
and Scylla.
there, Michael, you see, that's why I didn't put your name in the bowl.
you're the only one here that's irreplaceable.
agents, informants, muscle-- they're nice to have, but...
finally they're replaceable.
there's a branch about 20 minutes away.
that mind of yours
it's one in a million.
nice to see it finally working for me.
I do not work for you.
not yet.
it's legitimate,
I assure you.
Oh, okay.
I just want to withdraw the $10, 000
so I can be sure the Luxembourg account is properly set up.
well.
is she in there?
Yeah, I saw her through the window.
she's talking to a tall, dark-haired guy.
they're the same guys who set us up at the hotel.
we wait until she comes out, just jump. So...
what do we do about her security?
I mean, we jump her, we gotta jump the guys she's with, and God knows how many other agents are gonna come crawling out of the woodwork like ants.
look, um... I hate to bring up the obvious, but last time I checked, you two still disagreed as to what to do with Scylla if we actually get it.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
well, let's skip the damn thing. I mean, who's gonna stop us?
a 17-year-old security guard?
no, probably the guy with the gun.
he'll open fire as soon as he sees our faces.
then, uh... maybe they shouldn't see our faces.
so then the pizza guy showed up, and Wayne jumped out of the bushes and tried to grab the pizza, but the...
but the guy...
my God.
are you okay, mister?
Yeah.
go call 911.
go, go. No.
no, don't call anyone.
okay?
don't call anybody.
don't call anyone.
you know, once baby brother's got his little hands on that magic box of yours,
I don't think it's going to be too hard for him to trick Magilla Gorilla, if you know what I'm saying.
no,
I don't.
and you really think that Scofield's going to risk his nephew's life?
he's gonna figure out something before he hands first prize over to the bad guys.
Scofield thinks pure, like a little Cub Scout.
Burrows, he just thinks like a cub.
he's right.
I don't feel comfortable having Scofield out there with something I want while I'm stuck here with nothing he wants.
I need leverage.
you saw the way Mahone pulled Scofield over when they first got here.
bet you a wooden nickel they was talking about little Dr. Underpants and her whereabouts.
too bad we don't know where that is.
wrong again, Curly.
while everyone was up here flapping their gums,
I took the liberty of toddling down to Mahone's car, checking out the last address he put in his GPS.
there's a gambler's chance we might find the leverage you're looking for right here.
I'm on it.
no.
you wanted to get in on the action, here's your chance.
okay, I'll just count this out for you.
that won't be necessary.
all righty.
here's a printed record of your transaction, and I think a balance that high, are you sure you don't want to talk to one of our investment specialists?
no, thank you.
everybody down on the ground!
now! Nobody move, nobody gets hurt.
you, down.
Oh!
what are the odds?
don't.
the case.
I'll take that.
Hi, Mom.
Scofield and Burrows leaving the bank, now!
take Scylla and go!
we gotta stay together!
I said go!
come on!
I think he's out.
move in.
after today's events, how much egg does the U. S. court system have on its face for exonerating Lincoln Burrow? in the first place.
an omelet's worth, Paula.
if you remember I was never in favor of the exoneration.
Lincoln Burrows is a thug for hire, and his little brother is no better.
I'm amazed that the court system just glossed over the warning signs.
such as?
for one, they should've never let Burrows and Scofield in the same prison.
they should've looked at Scofield's past.
it's clear that he had no criminal background.
why would a brilliant structural engineer rob a bank?
easy now, Doc, easy.
it's just your friendly, neighborhood T-Bag.
now I'm gonna need your cooperation.
get your hands off me, you son of a... Hand, not hands, thanks to your boyfriend.
now, as I was saying before,
I just need your cooperation.
come in here
all right.
he's taking too long.
something's wrong.
we gotta go back for him.
he said he'd catch up.
no, something's wrong.
call him.
call him.
now that we have this, what the hell are we going to do with it?
he's not answering.
I heard about the bank robbery on the radio.
you boys just can't stand to be out of the news, can you?
I assume you've got Scylla?
we're getting close.
we'll keep you posted.
I wouldn't hang up just yet if I were you, son.
Michael, we're in the apartment.
I know you have it.
otherwise,
Christina would never have risked a public shootout.
now, I'm going to make this easy for you, bring me Scylla, or this time, Sara's death will not be faked.
what is it?
what is it?
the General has Sarah.
take it.
I swear if you touch her...
Hello, son.
I believe you have something I want.
and I have something you want
although I'll never really understand why.
all right, maybe we can work something out.
I gave you the opportunity to work something out.
you rejected me, Michael.
look, let's meet and talk about this.
now the time for talking passed about the time you put those ski masks on, don't you think?
so, here's what I'm going to do, Michael.
I'm going to shoot Lincoln through the right rib cage, just grazing the lower quadrant of his right lung.
it will slowly collapse, making it very difficult to breathe.
if he doesn't get medical attention, within five hours, he'll be dead.
Christina... Mom... please
second hand's spinning, Michael.
looks like you have a little decision to make.
or someone you love.
when were you planning on telling me that your mother was behind you on this?
you have today, one day.
when Burrows brings Scylla back to us, you will be the one to put a bullet in his brain.
the son of Prime Minister Nandu Banerjee.
soon, this will all be behind us, and maybe I can meet my grandson.
Where's Linc?!
there's an energy conference.
the Panda Bay Hotel. He'll be there.
Christina's plan... what she needed to profit from Scylla, an incident that'll domino into global warming.
No!
they rented this in Linc's name.
look at this. It's a setup!
his hands are all over the shells.
lincoln's right back where he started.
it really is too bad about Michael.
we gotta go.
I need a doctor here!
there they are!
they're up there! They're up there!
let's go upstairs, now!
move it, move it!
look, let's just blend into the crowd.
no, we can't go that way.
the door is locked, Michael.
stand back.
down here move!
this whole thing is falling apart.
is it?
is it really?
what, do you think this is funny? Huh?
how long you think it's gonna take before the General sees this on the news?
if he thinks we can't get Scylla, how long do you think it's gonna take before he comes after us?
and then he comes after our families?
Yeah, it's really funny, isn't it?
Michael, where are you?
we're still in the hotel.
is there any other way to get out of here without being seen?
no, there's cops and feds all over the place.
did you get Scylla?
no.
some guy got assassinated.
and guess who got set up for it.
we need Scylla.
Scylla is gone!
the only thing I care about right now is getting out of here.
Oh, yeah? Where you gonna go, Michael, huh?
with the Company breathing down our back again.
Scofield, it's Don.
what do you want?
to try to fix this.
how?
by stabbing us in the back again?
put Alex on.
he's a little preoccupied right now.
look, you want to be mad at me, be mad at me after we get Scylla back.
now listen to me.
okay, the southwest loading dock is a large industrial door.
it's not conducive to a quick exit.
they only have one cop on it.
when you get to the door, I can incapacitate the cop.
problem is, we're on the other side of the hotel, and they've got the ground floor covered.
what else can you see on the outside?
nothing, just the cop, a couple of Dumpsters, jack pallets and some laundry bins.
that must mean the on-site laundry's on the other side of the hotel, near the loading dock door.
if we get to the laundry, we can get to the door.
you said we can't make it across the hotel.
but we can get access to the roof.
hotels use rooftop ventilation, so the hotel guests don't smell the laundry fumes.
okay, so, listen, take the ventilation system to the laundry room;
if you can get to the laundry room, you're gonna get right by the door.
put me on speaker.
Alex, you want to get The Company off our backs?
go to 4 Dunn Place.
Sara's holding my mother there.
make her tell us where Scylla is.
and clear our names in all this.
Mahone, you need to do whatever you gotta do to get her to talk, you hear me?
do whatever you gotta do.
got it.
come on.
it is complete mayhem at the Panda Bay Hotel where Naveen Banerjee, the son of India's Prime Minister, has been assassinated.
amazingly, there have been unconfirmed reports identifying the assailants as none other than Lincoln Burrows, the man who'd been suspected of murdering Terrence Steadman, and Michael Scofield, his mastermind brother...
Christina sandbagged all of us!
if the brothers are caught, we have no control over what they might say to the authorities.
get down to that hotel and make sure they don't have that opportunity.
uh, General, I'd be more than willing to take on that assignment.
and I assure you I will dispatch of it efficiently.
this is not an Alabama coon hunt, Teddy.
don't judge me by desperate actions I've taken when there's been a gun to my head.
I ran an entire prison gang syndicate.
hardened felons called me "Mister."
I'm so much more than a snitch.
and if you continue to treat me as such, it will be your loss, General, not mine.
son, I have the fate of a multi-trillion dollar enterprise in my hands, and you want me to let you earn your stripes now?!
take care of the brothers.
here we go! Here we go!
this should be it.
perfect.
they say ours should be here shortly.
I want you guys on full alert and get all geared up, all right?
it's them!
stop!
they could be on any floor.
can you override the door locks?
Yeah, they're electronic.
we control everything from down here.
I want every room in this hotel locked down now!
why don't we just take the stairs to the roof?
because we'll set off the fire alarm.
the ducts in the crawl spaces above these top floor rooms, that's how we get our rooftop access.
once we find the laundry vent, we take that down to the loading dock.
that should do it.
go! Go!
what's going on?
they locked us out.
we can't get to the roof.
let's head back down.
there'll be cops in the stairwell.
we can't go up, we can't go down...
we're trapped.
there has been a new development in the Panda Bay assassination.
an anonymous source has provided FOX with documents showing a wire transfer from Chinese operatives to Burrows and Scofield.
the fallout from this from a geopolitical standpoint is staggering.
relations between China and India...
Nandu reached out.
he wants to meet with you.
this couldn't have worked out better.
nice audible on the Chinese document.
thank you.
now we just...
watch the dominoes begin to fall.
I just wish they weren't falling on Michael.
Christina, you gave him options, he made his choice, he picked his side.
Yes, but he is my son.
my only son.
and right now it is believed both Burrows and Scofield are still in the hotel, but it appears the police are closing in.
live just outside the Panda Bay Hotel...
no, no, no, you see, that's the problem, Michael.
there's cops everywhere.
it's like a freaking cop anthill out here.
look, it's just a matter of time till they find you anyway.
find out what their plan of attack is.
sure, you know what?
Yeah, I'll just go up and ask them, all right?
they look like a real friendly bunch.
we don't have much time, so get it done now!
Burrows and Scofield could be armed to the teeth.
it's tight quarters in the stairwell, so I don't want a lot of shooting, all right?
this guy's from Homeland Security.
I'll file my report as soon as I've apprehended the shooters.
whoa, whoa, let me be clear here, Captain.
the shooting that happened today wasn't your typical gangbanger, public service killing you're used to here in Miami.
this was an international assassination with ramifications that directly affect the security of this country.
so, if you turn your back on me again,
I'll jam you up for hindering a federal investigation.
you understand?
fine.
but I want you on my hip.
I'm not gonna have you running around playing weekend warrior so you can go back to your buddies at the office and tell them you saw some real gun play, understood?
not a problem.
now, why don't you start by telling me how you're gonna diffuse the situation?
we're gonna gas them out floor by floor until we find them.
whoa, hold on there, Tex. If you use gas you're gonna compromise visibility and I can't afford another diplomat getting shot in the fez.
we're using chloropropane.
it's colorless, it's odorless.
they won't even know what hit them.
all right, listen up.
I want two men in the east stairwell with the gas, two at the base of the west stairwell in case they try to come back down again.
I'll have backup detail ready, all right?
let's go, move, move!
Oh, my God.
come on Sara, you hurt? You okay?
I'm fine. Christina's gone.
there's a knife in the last drawer.
do you have any idea where she went?
no.
she has Scylla.
she set up Linc and Michael.
she could be anywhere.
michael and Lincoln?
Yeah, they were framed for the murder of an Indian official.
it's all over the news.
that was Christina's plan, and...
where are they now?
they're trapped at the Panda Bay Hotel.
the police are looking for them.
okay.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't go there.
the cops are everywhere. I really need you to get out of my way.
well, that's not gonna happen.
you don't care for me, I don't care for you much either, but I owe Michael, okay? Run.
he's in a sea of trouble right now. I'm not abandoning him.
I'm not telling you to abandon him. There's nothing you can do for him.
listen, I'd run if I could run.
but if I run, they go after my wife, so I have to jump back in.
you don't.
I'm not running.
I'll stay here, okay?
that way, Michael knows where I am.
so does Christina.
if she wanted me dead, I would be already.
suit yourself.
Thanks.
and if you see Michael, tell him I'm here.
Yeah.
I know how difficult this must be for you.
Mr. Prime Minister, I, too, lost a son when he was just a child.
was your son murdered by an assailant's bullet?
of course not.
I've heard the news that the Chinese are behind this.
Yes, I've heard that as well.
and that's why I'm here.
not to discuss how my son died, but how to avenge him.
your technology-- as you put it
I've heard rumors of its varied applications.
Nandu, let's take a breath here.
No! The time to take a breath expired when my son died.
your son and I had planned to use the technology for humanitarian endeavors.
warfare applications were not our goal.
but now they are mine, and at the end of the day, you're a businesswoman with a product and I am a buyer.
I want to commit to all the intellectual property you possess.
I want the People's Republic of China to feel the pain I feel right now!
do you comprehend the ramifications of what it is you're proposing?
more than you know.
if it is what you want.
I must go now...
to make arrangements for your payment and arrangements for my child's burial.
yeah?
Congratulations. You're famous again.
you're all over the news for killing Gandhi.
I figured as much.
Yeah, well, it gets worse.
they're gonna gas you out. When?
they already started. They're going floor-by-floor.
they're about at the third or fourth floor right now.
why are you just telling me about this now?
I had to leave the lobby.
I can't make anybody more suspicious.
Hello, Michael? Michael?
Linc, I need your help.
when I was in fourth grade,
I... I got an A for guessing all the answers on this test.
I never thought I'd beat those odds.
what kind of loser gets set up for two high-profile assassinations within five years?
are you kidding? This is not your fault.
if they didn't get away with it then, they're not gonna get away with it now.
but I need you to focus.
I need your help, Linc.
right. Let's get out of here.
Darrin Hooks, Homeland Security.
can you point me to whoever's in charge here?
homeland? How many of you guys are they sending here?
agent Self's already inside.
who?
agent Don Self.
got here a little while ago.
Yeah, it's Hooks.
the name of that agent that was supposedly killed recently in L. A?
was his name Don Self?
it's all falling out exactly as Christina planned it.
now she's going to have everything she ever hoped for.
she's trying to reignite the 1962 China-India Border War which ended in an uneasy truce when neither country could withstand the losses they were sustaining in those remote and desolate mountains.
if she succeeds in provoking another war, and framing China for the killing of India's Prime Minister's son, it's certainly provocation enough.
she'll set off a military conflict that will last for decades that may never be resolved.
why didn't you do it yourself?
power, money, seem to be things you love.
because if India's involved, that drags in Pakistan.
then Russia's gonna want to defend its borders.
then within a year, Europe's in it and after that, the United States.
it's an apocalypse in which everyone loses!
and Christina has always been too prideful and too unstable to accept it.
got it.
can I help you?
Hi. Yes, I think you can.
agent Self.
agent Darrin Hooks.
it's good to see you.
it's good to see you, too.
hold it. Hold it right there. Don't move.
what the hell are you doing, Hooks?
you always pull guns on fellow agents?
Yeah, when agents that are supposedly dead and are found later in a hotel with the guys that killed him.
you mind telling me what you're doing here with Burrows and Scofield?
my cover called for me to be dead, okay?
people were catching on to what we were doing, and my death freed me up
but Burrows and Scofield have been set up, okay?
there's no record of you in covert ops.
that was by design.
look, when this is all over, we'll call the home office,
I'll punch in my clearance code, you can buy me a couple of drinks, and we'll share some laughs about this.
but right now I need to do my damn job.
no.
you're gonna follow and we're gonna clear this up right now.
okay, but what I said about Scofield and Burrows is true.
they've been set up.
you need to look into this.
Oh, I'm gonna look into everything as soon as we get outside.
let's go.
did you clear the loading dock doors?
no, but someone else did.
what do you mean?
someone must've taken him out.
which means there's someone in the hotel other than the police that's looking for you.
we got to move.
got more than just the cops after us now.
whoa, whoa. You know what you're doing?
no.
let's go.
captain Hutchinson!
we've got a room breach on 16.
this is Hutchinson.
Scofield and Burrows are on 16.
I repeat, Scofield and Burrows are on 16.
move, move, move!
this way.
make sure the door can shut.
we need the pressure to build.
they're coming. They're coming!
we're on 16.
copy that.
on my mark.
go.
backup detail!
move! Go, go, go, go!
move, move, move! Go, move!
move, move!
what the hell happened?
they booby-trapped us.
they made a move for the roof.
all right, get them to a hospital.
all right. Let's go! Move, move, move!
stop right there!
don't make a move for that weapon, Burrows.
take the masks off.
take them off now!
hands behind your head.
you'd better pray to God that my men are found out all right.
it was a concussive blast.
they're just unconscious.
shut up.
easy!
easy.
and I'd follow that advice about not going for your guns.
the General would like you back at the office.
now.
did all go well at the hotel?
what's going on with Sara and my mother?
Christina escaped.
Sara's okay.
she's in the condo.
excuse me, would you boys like a little alone time to catch up?
what exactly do you expect from us?
you need to take responsibility for your failures.
Hey, we failed nothing.
this whole thing was a setup.
you know it. Lincoln Burrows was outsmarted.
who could have anticipated that?
I think you need to accept that this is over.
I've been holding a chip for far too long.
it's time to play it.
I made you boys a promise.
you would find Scylla and I would see to it you got some cash and had the slate wiped clean.
I intend to keep that promise.
however, if I keep one promise,
I have to keep them all.
now...
I wonder who the big winner will be.
don't do this. Don't do what?
when I sent you those envelopes, I wasn't just playing games.
I made it very clear that you had one day to accomplish your job, or there would be consequences.
what's that?
the consequence.
call our man in Queens.
Queens? What are you calling New York for?
put it on speaker, please.
Yes. Move on subject four.
I'm a block away.
ETA is less than two minutes.
you son of a bitch.
you son of a bitch!
my wife is a defenseless woman.
Mr. Self didn't inform you that he had a wife, did he?
well, I wouldn't talk about my wife either if I'd had a few too many bourbons, got behind the wheel, and turned a beautiful young woman into a piece of broccoli.
don't do anything.
I assume that is why you tried to run away with Scylla?
to screw a government that was giving you benefits that would only pay for a county facility overlooking the Belt Parkway, and to sell it so that you and she could disappear and be hidden forever.
I have the subject in sights.
she's in a wheelchair under a tree in the hospital courtyard.
do I have a go?
please don't do this.
okay, please, you can kill me, okay, you can kill me right now, please, kill me.
you don't need to do this; we'll get Scylla.
that's what I wanted to hear. Well, that's what we're trying to do!
we're getting it. But you have to know what awaits you and your loved ones if you don't.
we understand, okay?
execute the order. Please don't do it!
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
get help, hel--!
I believe you made a request.
Bagwell, make sure he's dead.
does everyone understand now?
are we all on the same page?
good.
let's get down to business.
three-quarters of a billion dollars in a numerical account in Luxembourg.
if you are still worried about humanitarian efforts, write a check to UNICEF.
all the data will be delivered within 24 hours.
that's what I expected.
you played it perfectly.
reach out to our contact in China.
I have a feeling they may be interested in what we're selling as well.
Christina, I don't advise playing both sides of this coin.
reach out to China.
No! Keep our people at every private airfield in Florida and in Georgia.
we can't have Christina leaving the state.
she played on India's emotions, which probably means she'd want to meet with one of their emissaries today while they're still running hot.
she could still be in Miami, maybe at the embassy.
no, she's not at the embassy.
any deal she makes with India will be strictly off the radar.
right now she's concerned with two things.
one is closing the deal on Scylla, which I'm assuming she's already done, and the second is getting paid.
no sign of Self.
how much can she get for Scylla?
half a billion from India, the same from China.
overseas account?
foreign wire transfer?
I doubt she's taking any food stamps.
she's going to want confirmation that that money is safely overseas before she leaves the U. S.
we find the money, we find my mother.
normally it takes three business days for an international wire transfer to clear, unless the bank is a Federal Reserve signatory, in which case the transfer is immediate.
you think she'll head to the bank?
all she has to do is withdraw a few grand from the millions that that buyer has probably transferred overseas already.
she'll know it's all there.
so let's find a Federal Reserve signatory bank in Miami.
we'll have a shot at finding her.
and Scylla.
there, Michael, you see, that's why I didn't put your name in the bowl.
you're the only one here that's irreplaceable.
agents, informants, muscle-- they're nice to have, but...
finally they're replaceable.
there's a branch about 20 minutes away.
that mind of yours
it's one in a million.
nice to see it finally working for me.
I do not work for you.
not yet.
it's legitimate,
I assure you.
Oh, okay.
I just want to withdraw the $10, 000
so I can be sure the Luxembourg account is properly set up.
well.
is she in there?
Yeah, I saw her through the window.
she's talking to a tall, dark-haired guy.
they're the same guys who set us up at the hotel.
we wait until she comes out, just jump. So...
what do we do about her security?
I mean, we jump her, we gotta jump the guys she's with, and God knows how many other agents are gonna come crawling out of the woodwork like ants.
look, um... I hate to bring up the obvious, but last time I checked, you two still disagreed as to what to do with Scylla if we actually get it.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
well, let's skip the damn thing. I mean, who's gonna stop us?
a 17-year-old security guard?
no, probably the guy with the gun.
he'll open fire as soon as he sees our faces.
then, uh... maybe they shouldn't see our faces.
so then the pizza guy showed up, and Wayne jumped out of the bushes and tried to grab the pizza, but the...
but the guy...
my God.
are you okay, mister?
Yeah.
go call 911.
go, go. No.
no, don't call anyone.
okay?
don't call anybody.
don't call anyone.
you know, once baby brother's got his little hands on that magic box of yours,
I don't think it's going to be too hard for him to trick Magilla Gorilla, if you know what I'm saying.
no,
I don't.
and you really think that Scofield's going to risk his nephew's life?
he's gonna figure out something before he hands first prize over to the bad guys.
Scofield thinks pure, like a little Cub Scout.
Burrows, he just thinks like a cub.
he's right.
I don't feel comfortable having Scofield out there with something I want while I'm stuck here with nothing he wants.
I need leverage.
you saw the way Mahone pulled Scofield over when they first got here.
bet you a wooden nickel they was talking about little Dr. Underpants and her whereabouts.
too bad we don't know where that is.
wrong again, Curly.
while everyone was up here flapping their gums,
I took the liberty of toddling down to Mahone's car, checking out the last address he put in his GPS.
there's a gambler's chance we might find the leverage you're looking for right here.
I'm on it.
no.
you wanted to get in on the action, here's your chance.
okay, I'll just count this out for you.
that won't be necessary.
all righty.
here's a printed record of your transaction, and I think a balance that high, are you sure you don't want to talk to one of our investment specialists?
no, thank you.
everybody down on the ground!
now! Nobody move, nobody gets hurt.
you, down.
Oh!
what are the odds?
don't.
the case.
I'll take that.
Hi, Mom.
Scofield and Burrows leaving the bank, now!
take Scylla and go!
we gotta stay together!
I said go!
come on!
I think he's out.
move in.
after today's events, how much egg does the U. S. court system have on its face for exonerating Lincoln Burrow? in the first place.
an omelet's worth, Paula.
if you remember I was never in favor of the exoneration.
Lincoln Burrows is a thug for hire, and his little brother is no better.
I'm amazed that the court system just glossed over the warning signs.
such as?
for one, they should've never let Burrows and Scofield in the same prison.
they should've looked at Scofield's past.
it's clear that he had no criminal background.
why would a brilliant structural engineer rob a bank?
easy now, Doc, easy.
it's just your friendly, neighborhood T-Bag.
now I'm gonna need your cooperation.
get your hands off me, you son of a... Hand, not hands, thanks to your boyfriend.
now, as I was saying before,
I just need your cooperation.
come in here
all right.
he's taking too long.
something's wrong.
we gotta go back for him.
he said he'd catch up.
no, something's wrong.
call him.
call him.
now that we have this, what the hell are we going to do with it?
he's not answering.
I heard about the bank robbery on the radio.
you boys just can't stand to be out of the news, can you?
I assume you've got Scylla?
we're getting close.
we'll keep you posted.
I wouldn't hang up just yet if I were you, son.
Michael, we're in the apartment.
I know you have it.
otherwise,
Christina would never have risked a public shootout.
now, I'm going to make this easy for you, bring me Scylla, or this time, Sara's death will not be faked.
what is it?
what is it?
the General has Sarah.
take it.
I swear if you touch her...
Hello, son.
I believe you have something I want.
and I have something you want
although I'll never really understand why.
all right, maybe we can work something out.
I gave you the opportunity to work something out.
you rejected me, Michael.
look, let's meet and talk about this.
now the time for talking passed about the time you put those ski masks on, don't you think?
so, here's what I'm going to do, Michael.
I'm going to shoot Lincoln through the right rib cage, just grazing the lower quadrant of his right lung.
it will slowly collapse, making it very difficult to breathe.
if he doesn't get medical attention, within five hours, he'll be dead.
Christina... Mom... please
second hand's spinning, Michael.
looks like you have a little decision to make.
or someone you love.
when I sent you those envelopes,
I wasn't just playing games.
move on subject four.
my wife is a defenseless woman . execute the order.
please don't do that!
don't call anyone.
you wanted to get in on the action, here's your chance.
three-quarters of a billion dollars in a numerical account in Luxembourg.
all the data will be delivered within 24 hours.
case.
I'll take that.
Hi, Mom.
I know you have it.
bring me Scylla or this time Sara's death will not be faked.
looks like you have a little decision to make:
Scylla...
or someone you love.
just think this through, Michael.
I have, and we're saving them both.
how?
I will figure it out.
your brother's bleeding to death.
I wonder if we can get them to bring Linc and Sara to the same place.
right now, your only advantage is that neither party knows that there's another player that has leverage on you.
you bring them both together, you lose your tactical edge.
I'm not abandoning Sara.
I didn't say to do that.
what I am saying is that Sara has the advantage of not having a bullet in her chest.
one at a time.
big surprise.
the dumb one got caught, the smart one got away.
I'm beginning to see a pattern here.
he's never gonna give it to you.
hmm, I disagree.
he truly cares for you.
no matter how many times you've shown you don't deserve it.
you know, you two are truly a classic study of nature versus nurture.
same environment, same parents
you're completely different.
why do you think that is, Lincoln?
because Mom's a psychotic bitch.
Hello, Michael.
all right, you win.
I'll give you Scylla.
just give Linc whatever help he needs.
not until I get what I need.
edison Shipping Yard, B Dock, 45 minutes.
and bring my brother.
45 minutes? Cutting it close.
he doesn't look so good.
just be there.
is is worth it, Sara?
do you ever go back to that night and wonder how things would have gone if you had just left that infirmary door locked?
all the people who's lives would have been saved.
hell, your father would still be alive.
you ever think about that?
and now that Michael's returning Scylla to me, it was all for nothing.
assuming he does return it.
if the situation were reversed, if Michael were here and you were holding Scylla, what would y y do?
you'd bring it back for the same reason you left that door unlocked;
because you couldn't let an innocent man die.
your heart betrays your better judgment.
so does Scofield's.
you know, you're probably right.
because if Michael had used his better judgment the night he stole Scylla out from under your nose, he would have killed you.
get her out of my sight.
take it.
either take my pocket or I take yours.
understand?
the authorities are blanketing the streets looking for the primary suspects,Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield.
the brothers, famous for one of the most daring prison breaks in recent history, are considered armed and extremely dangerous.
homemade explosives?
you got a better idea?
maybe the best way to save Linc
to save everyone
is give Christina what she wants.
I'm just trying to find a way where the people that we love don't end up on an autopsy table. And I'm not?
better get your story straight, Alex.
this whole time you've been saying we should give Scylla back to the General.
what, you didn't hear what he did to Self's wife?
self made his own bed.
Yeah, and we're sleeping in it.
let's say, best-case scenario, okay, that maybe somehow we're able to get to Linc and Sara.
okay, what then?
general's still got somebody watching my wife.
what's the plan to keep her safe?
what about LJ?
what's the plan to keep him safe?
I can't think about that right now.
maybe we go to your mother and try to make a deal.
I mean, there's no love lost between her and the General.
with her contacts, if we give her Scylla, maybe she can find out where the agents...
we're not giving up and we're not giving it back!
we're gonna save everyone!
what the hell are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
you're in Recovery, Mr. Self.
apparently, you had quite a fall.
luckily, someone found you and called 911.
they did what?
the doctor will be in shortly to go over your history.
no, no, no, no.
tell the doctor to go see the next guy.
I'm going.
actually, I can't.
there's some men here waiting to talk to you.
what kind of men?
the kind with badges.
Mr. Self, my name is Agent Chris Franco.
this is Agent Wilson Wright. We're with the Bureau.
we'd like to ask you a few questions.
about what?
let's start with where we can find Lincoln Burrows and Michael Scofield.
be ready to pick us up.
better not get too close to that thing when it goes off.
and you better not get too far.
all right, if Michael tries anything, take out both knees.
I don't want him dead,
I just want him immobilized and eager to talk.
and what do you want to do with Burrows?
once I get Scylla, dump him off the dock.
Yeah, one of them guys from the news,
I think I just seen him.
interesting choice.
I would have thought you'd picked something a little more public for your own protection.
something a little more public isn't safe for me right now, thanks to you.
did you come alone?
did you?
come on.
we can have at least one honest conversation, can't we?
actually, I'd like that.
in spite of what you think,
I never wanted to see you get hurt.
what did you want?
understanding...
forgiveness.
but when I made my choice, I knew I'd never have any of those things.
but you will have power, won't you?
Yes, and you'll have Lincoln.
quite honestly,
I think you're getting the short end of the stick.
speaking of which, I need to get him to a hospital, so where is he?
where is Scylla?
I need to know he's alive.
satisfied?
follow me.
now, you wouldn't have some little trick up your sleeve, would you, son?
I'm done playing games with you.
good. Then bring Scylla out to me.
if I bring Scylla out in the open, your man will shoot me.
well, then I guess we have a standoff.
the only thing is, what I want isn't gasping for air and losing a pint of blood every ten minutes.
give it to me, Michael.
you know I can't do that.
give it to me, Michael.
you're running out of options, son.
I said no.
this is the Miami Police!
give it to me, Michael!
Christina, we gotta go!
come and get it.
go get it.
son of a...
come on, come on, Michael.
Michael, we gotta go now!
now!
so the government helped you out?
after all we've been through, you know how crazy that sounds, huh?
well, the proof is there.
every morning I wake up my little girl, and she's healthy again, man.
where are you living?
actually, uh, that's why I came down here to talk to you.
you know, uh...
we were in protective custody while I was waiting to testify against Mahone, but his case fell through.
anyway they wanted to not only renege on my deal, they wanted to put my ass back in Fox River.
so, what are you doing here in Chicago following me?
I was wondering if you, uh, had any idea of where Michael and Linc were.
wait, wait, whoa, whoa, where you going?
look, you in a bind with the feds, and now you want to know about Mike and Linc?
come on, come on... What, you gonna bust me, too?
no, I am trying to help you, man.
and them.
okay, man, don't you watch the news, Sucre?
they are in a lot of trouble.
big time.
and the only way they can get out of it is if you help me find them.
we're just trying to find the two men behind this assassination.
well, obviously your clearance level isn't high enough for you to fully grasp the operation that I've been involved with.
all right, then how about we tell you what we've grasped so far.
the dead body of your partner, Agent Miriam Holtz
autopsy shows the bullet she was shot with was fired from an agency-issued firearm. Right.
the disappearance of your direct supervisor at Homeland, a Mr. Herb Stanton.
okay. We also got a number of DHS transportation officers with interesting information concerning a warehouse back in Los Angeles that you were conducting some kind of secret operation out of.
so when an international political figure is assassinated on American soil by two men taken into custody by a Homeland Security agent, who by all appearances has gone rogue, you tell us what we're supposed to think is going on.
what's going on is you're talking to a federal agent like I'm an accomplice to a crime that I had nothing to do with.
do you have any idea how many years I've served my country?
do you have any idea to the extent that I've served my...? What is this, Gitmo now?
as a Homeland agent, you are aware, I'm sure, that anyone who impedes an investigation into an act of terrorism has virtually no protection under the law.
okay! Okay!
okay.
now...
where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows?
I don't know where they are.
okay?
but I could find out.
well, Michael clearly cares more about winning then he does about saving your life.
looks like you're not going to live long enough to be an uncle.
: what? What?
Sara hasn't told anybody.
Christina, Banerjee's on the phone.
he wants to know why he hasn't received the technology.
if Michael doesn't call in the next ten minutes, you're gonna wish he'd let you fry back at Fox River.
hello.
general: I thought we had an understanding.
I thought I made the stakes crystal clear.
you did, and I'm trying.
and I'm trying not to kill Sara, but that would be a lot easier if I had something in this hand besides a gun.
look, every cop and fed in this city is looking for me.
the last thing I want to do is jeopardize her life by getting arrested and having the very thing you want locked up as evidence.
well, I appreciate you taking care of my interests, Michael.
I do.
and believe me, for that reason
I will take care of your interests, but if I don't see Scylla in one hour
I'm unleashing Bagwell to play doctor with the doctor.
am I clear?!
I need more time.
one hour!
doesn't Michael understand?
he's playing chicken with other people's lives here.
my life's been threatened before.
I'm not talking about yours.
that boy has messed up every chance I've ever had at freedom.
this is my last shot.
you really think when this is over you're going to be free?
better than free-- I'm going to be employed.
the General's getting me an honest-to-goodness job with an office and a desk.
what kind of a job is he going to get you, huh?
what's he going to trust you with?
the General hires professional killers, not amateurs.
not uneducated criminals who rape and kill.
you mind your tongue, little lady.
the only thing you're getting when this is over is a slit throat and an unmarked grave.
actually, your only chance at a life is to get out of here.
and if you take me with you, whatever's happened between you and Michael, if you get me back to him, the slate could be wiped clean.
with Michael and me...
that slate's never going to be clean.
and if he doesn't give the General what he wants...
...It's going to get a hell of a lot dirtier.
what are you doing?
I need to make sure Linc's okay.
I suppose that little explosion was meant for me.
let's pretend that was for the cops.
please, Michael, stop.
you're embarrassing yourself.
you should know by now that you can't outthink me.
I'll always be one step ahead of you because I'm your mother.
is Linc okay?
hm.
I remember the first time
I caught you in a lie.
I could see it in your eyes, just like I could see it today.
put him on the phone.
you're not in a position to be making demands, son.
actually, if Linc is dead,
I have no reason to give you Scylla, which puts me in exactly the position you describe.
Yeah.
Hey, it's nice to know you're still breathing.
how much time do I have?
not much.
the General has Sara.
he's giving me an hour to exchange her for Scylla.
I need to know where you are, so if you can give me any kind of signal.
don't know.
look, if I'm going to save you both,
I need something. Banerjee again.
there's just not enough time, Michael.
I can do this, Linc.
I can do this.
there's something you need to know.
Sara's p... Sara's pregnant.
: it's... it's okay.
you're going to be a dad.
CHRISTINA: No, I understand.
now, if you just give us a little more time...
go to her, Michael.
I'll find a way, Linc.
there's not enough time.
there's just not enough time.
let me go out knowing that I did something for you.
give me that! Let me...
I am sorry about what's happening to Linc
and I know you have to protect your family,
I understand that, but, Michael, what are we going to do about the rest of us?
what are we going to do about my wife?
Alex, I don't...
I don't know what you want me to say.
you haven't gone a day in your life without a plan.
please don't start now.
all I know is
I have 43 minutes to get this to the General.
I am done making plans.
and to hell with everybody else.
well...
maybe it's time I take a page from your book, Alex.
hang out on the sidelines, survey the field.
when the time is right, back the winning horse.
that's what you think I'm about?
tell me something, Alex, which horse are you backing now?
because I'm not quite clear on that.
at least you got a decision.
they took my son.
I didn't get to choose.
I'm just trying to do whatever it takes to...
to not lose everything.
so am I.
so if there's something you need to do to protect Pam, you should do it.
do you realize after what you pulled, you're completely worthless to me now?
you've been worthless to me all your life.
I know you and Michael think I was a terrible mother.
couldn't agree with you more.
I warned Aldo.
I told him I was not cut out for it.
it is not in my nature!
he used to call me his Lady Macbeth.
I knew there was a reason I hated Shakespeare.
you hated it because you couldn't understand it.
you couldn't understand it because...
your real mother was as dumb as a day-old doughnut.
you asked me how I could just sit and watch my son go into the chair.
the answer's simple really.
you're not my son.
michael already knows.
that must be why it's so easy for him to play with your life.
I guess we have that in common.
now, go find my son.
your information leads to an arrest, we'll make sure the courts can't touch you.
right. Well, you put that in writing and then we're in business.
no, no, the only thing you get to demand in writing is what we put on your tombstone.
last thing you're going to want to find out about is the brothers killing somebody else while you're in here harassing your only source of intel.
it needs to be in writing, and signed by the attorney general.
I don't trust anyone who says they work for the government.
all you have to do...
is call the brothers.
get them on the phone, let me talk to them.
and then they can make up their own minds, all right?
I'm just trying to stay out of all this.
I finally got my family back, and I'm not about to risk losing them again.
I know this feels good today.
but what about a couple months from now, huh?
when the only job you can get is under the table or some labor gig, where every minute you'll be worrying about the guy you're sweating next to, if he's gonna drop the dime in a heartbeat because he recognizes you.
how is finding Linc and Mike gonna change any of that?
this guy sought me out, okay?
he knows everything about this whole thing.
well, is he government?
cause if he's government, I don't want...
I didn't trust him at first either!
okay? But it's something about being in the pen where you start to decipher who is a player and who is a punk.
and this guy is a player.
just like Scofield.
so the only thing that we have to do is tell him where the brothers are, help him get this device thing back, and-and so he can put it into the right hands.
and then what? Hmm?
this brother has juice.
he can erase our entire record.
now, I'm not talking about cash and all that flashy stuff.
I'm just talking about straight up freedom, living like a man. You feel me?
no, of course, Nandu.
it... Yes, yes.
we just ran into a few technical difficulties, so...
no, I understand.
now, if you just give us a little more time, then, um...
no, no, no. No, no, don't.
no, please don't get on the plane.
no, I can...
you just cost me three-quarters of a billion dollars!
: good.
at least the day wasn't a total waste.
I was gonna wait till I found Michael and just kill you in front of him, but instead,
I'm gonna take you out the same way you came in-- alone.
you better be calling me to tell me you've got Scylla.
whoever you've sent after it is too late.
Michael's giving Scylla back to the General in exchange for Sara's life.
who the hell is this?
Alex Mahone. I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting.
Oh, yeah.
you calling to rub this in my face?
calling to see if you'll make me an offer.
I can get Scylla for you, if you promise to give me what Michael can't.
what's that?
protection for my family.
if your people can get my wife away from whoever the General's got watching her, I'll get you Scylla.
you can get me Scylla?
you son of a bitch.
I've got no particular love for Burrows.
sounds like the feeling's mutual.
Yeah, but unlike his brother, the guy's always been straight with me.
and he helped me track down the guy who murdered my son, and for that, I owe him.
and you don't owe Michael?
not anymore.
his choice, not mine.
tell you what.
you give me Scylla, if Lincoln's still breathing, you can have him.
I like that deal.
hickory dickory dock.
tell me, has Scofield ever run up your clock?
has he been man enough to go there?
or is he saving it up for the wedding day?
michael is more man than you can ever hope to be.
how would you know what a man is like, huh?
of the two of us, I bet I've been with more of them.
look at you, all buttoned up...
frigid.
tell me, what does it take to loosen up a gal like you, huh?
music?
flowers?
touch?
where the fingers do the walking down to where only...
stop it!
please.
my, my.
I do like a woman with manners.
Michael, you better be calling me to tell me you're close.
we're almost there.
good. But I've changed my mind.
the exchange will be made at a location of my choosing.
forgive me, but I don't really trust you, except on unfamiliar territory.
you bring Sara unharmed, and...
I'll meet you anywhere.
uh, there's an old parking lot where Pelican Drive meets the beach.
be there in 20 minutes.
and I'm supposed to trust that you're just gonna let us live our lives, huh?
believe it or not, Michael, the last thing on Earth I want is to ever see you or any member of your family again.
you stay out of my way, I'll stay out of yours.
bring me Scylla.
20 minutes, Michael.
all right.
20 minutes!
about earlier...
I do think you're in it for yourself.
fortunately for me, that's meant you've also had my back.
more than once.
and for that,
I'm grateful.
take the case.
get out of here. What about Pam?
I got it handled.
good luck.
looks like your boyfriend straightened his priorities out.
that's too bad.
we were just starting to get familiar.
Teddy, what are you doing?
you said we was gonna bring her on the exchange.
all I'm giving Scofield today is a slow death.
so what are we gonna do with her?
whatever you like.
perhaps we've finally found a job for which you're perfectly suited.
Mr. Mahone?
I'm on my way.
and Michael?
I don't want to talk about Michael.
well, it seems Michael did a poor job choosing his friends.
none of us choose this.
this happened to us.
the only thing we choose is how it ends.
so just get your people in place to help my wife.
how does that sound?
one of our assets with the Bureau says that two agents are questioning Don Self at Miami Mission Hospital.
and the attorney general just issued a proclamation for his immunity.
you think he's a threat?
perhaps.
question is, to whom?
Hello?
Michael, it's Don Self.
how's it going?
Michael: Well, well, well.
thought you were dead.
if I had a dollar every time I've said that about you.
you sound funny, Don. What do you want?
what do I want?
you saw what that bastard did to my wife, right?
I want revenge.
where are you, so we can hook back up?
that's not necessary.
this whole thing's about to be over anyway.
what do you mean the whole thing?
what's going on?
I'm hanging up now, Don.
Hello?
Scofield's on a burner.
they're harder to trace.
we're gonna need more time.
well, he's gonna call back.
he just gets a little riled up.
but he'll call back. When?
after he kills somebody?
you heard; this thing's about to be over; Lord knows what that means.
get him back on the phone, Agent Self, now.
so this cat said that
Scofield and Linc should recognize him when they see him.
recognize him from where?
look, I don't know, man.
look, we've been in a lot of messed up places.
I'm just saying, it makes a difference.
besides, I mean, did he say what he was gonna do with Scylla if he gets it?
all this guy said is that he couldn't go to the government, 'cause no one government should have that much power.
now, look, man, you want to ask him yourself, he's right there.
he even give you a name?
said call him Paul.
sir.
if anyone tries to escape, aerate them.
general: Keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
Scofield's a tunnel rat.
you know...
I wasn't the only fox in the river to fall asleep at night dreaming about treasures was tucked beneath that white coat of yours.
every guy let their minds wander in between you and Nurse Katie, sometimes settling on the both of you.
you digging that?
all you old junkies like a little dirty talk.
let me see where those tracks are.
I think I can, I think I can.
if you let me go, I can tell the courts that you saved my life.
Teddy, if you let me go, I can petition for leniency.
I could tell them you saved my life.
I still have connections from my father.
you know, I was always thinking the way I was gonna get revenge on Scofield was to kill him.
just driving that knife right into his bleeding heart.
and now...
standing here looking at you, I'm thinking there's something worse than death for him.
please, no.
I'll return you in one piece.
but that piece gonna be a little used.
that's all.
and every time he looks at you...
every time he wants to be with you...
...he's gonna see me.
nothing!
we got to get back to the loft now.
Hey, Michael, this is Don calling back again.
listen, I know you have a beef with me.
all right? And I understand, but I think I have a way to get us all out of this.
okay, just please call me back.
how many messages we going to leave this guy before we move on to plan B?
look, he's going to call back, okay?
excuse me, gentlemen, I need to check on the patient.
just take a few minutes.
he's going to call back, okay?
there's coffee down the hall.
he's going to call back. Just be patient, okay?
we're going to get him.
how's it going, Doc?
it's going well.
is this your first time with me?
huh?
what is that?
I know you, right?
what...
Ooh, I bet you was a tomcat back when you was using, huh?
see, nowadays, you like to look a fella in the eyes, but back then...
back then, oh...
back then, I bet the last thing you wanted to do was see who you was keeping company with.
that's self worth for you.
see, I've always felt that the partner you choose to be with is just a reflection of how you're really feeling about yourself in that moment.
and I got to tell you, sister, right now, old Teddy is feeling like a million bucks.
Oh...
I'm going to be a gentleman about this.
I'm going to let you choose.
you tell me, how you like it, Sara and I'm going to give you just what the doctor ordered.
what, you got something to say?
just that while you and the other cons were taking care of yourselves, I...
Katie and I werereoing over your medical records trying to figure out how best to manage your care, figure out what makes you tick.
the thing I remember about you, Theodore?
nothing makes you tick.
you can't... tick.
what exactly are you implying?
that the reason you rape and kill and make pain is because you can't make love.
you've got neurogenic ED, probably caused by injuries you sustained during your own childhood sexual abuse.
that is a lie.
that is a lie.
talk all you want about what you're going to do to me, Theodore. You and I both know there is very little you can actually do.
all right.
you are just going to take back every word you just said.
you hear me? You hear me?!
there's no reason to be ashamed of it, Teddy.
so many men suffer from it.
shut up!
I don't know what is more insulting:
you thinking I'm erectorally challenged or you thinking I'm going to let you break out of here.
hmm, let me think about that.
I'm going to go with the first one.
now,
I'm going to show you just how functional I am.
please.
it's all right.
come here.
you all right?
get me out of here.
show me.
why don't you come inside, Alex?
we have a lot to talk about.
before we do any business...
I'd like some proof that Pam is safe.
we have an asset embedded in the Company operations room who was able to access the details of her location and the position of her bird-dog.
that's great.
that's not good enough.
I need to know that she's in the clear.
I'm ready to execute that order, but first, I need you to hand over Scylla.
it's only a matter of time before the General realizes that I turned my back on him.
and Michael.
and when he does, he's going to want revenge.
go make the call.
this isn't about threats.
this isn't about games.
this is about how people do business.
I would be a fool if I gave you everything you want before I had some kind of guarantee that I'm going to get everything I want.
you've been busy.
here it is.
Where's the rest of it?
all right.
I've kept my end of the deal.
time for you to make good on yours.
make the call, please, and Linc and I will be on our way.
well, if it's okay with you, I'd like to check this out first, make sure everything works before anybody goes anywhere.
lock him up.
what are you doing here?
saving your ass.
I couldn't make that choice, Sara.
I had to save you both.
if there's something you need to do to protect Pam, you should do it.
there may be some way we can save everyone.
the bad news is my mother can read my every move.
she says it's because she knows me.
the good news is she doesn't know you.
I knew the General would never honor his end of the arrangement.
I knew...
I knew he'd never bring you to the exchange, so
I did what I had to do.
how big an explosion are we talking about?
big enough to end all this, so we can...
maybe start something new.
I mean, if that's...
what you're feeling.
come on, you got to get off the table. Come on.
we got to get to the other side of the room.
over here.
slide down the wall.
you ready to get the hell out of here?
Yeah.
there's something wrong.
I'm not getting any kind of connection.
are you ready?
didn't think I'd be this nervous...
now or never.
alright, papi, let's do this.
he's over there.
you must be Michael.
your friend, Fernando, tells me you can use my services today.
very much so.
and I assume... that's the other half of your team?
you look beautiful.
thank you.
and it's my understanding you'd like to keep this simple?
we've never actually manage to keep anything simple...
you can try.
well. Let's begin then, shall we?
family and friends, we gather here...
to celebrate the union between Michael Scofield and Sara Tancredi.
sorry to break up the party. - What the hell's going on?
we have an arrest warrant.
what? - Wait, wait, wait.
we've talked to Agent Paul Kellerman in D. C, we've settle this with the feds.
we settle this with the feds weeks ago!
sir, back up!
we were exonerated. - Sir...
we were exonerated! - Back up!
we're not here for you. We're here for her.
she didn't do anything. She wasn't involved.
don't make this escalate!
you're under arrest for the murder of Christina Hampton.
what? She didn't kill anyone!
funny. Surveillance camera footage says different.
please, right this way. - Michael. Michael!
the Final Break
they'll not gonna let me see her.
why did Kellerman send you if you can't do anything?
they're trying to break both of you.
look, she has constitutional right to reasonable visitation.
I'll draw up an order to show cause and get it before the judge immediately.
what do you argue in?
do you argue in self defence? - How?
anything that might help her is out of frame.
security camera only shows Sara stepping up and firing at the victim.
pull the trigger, Michael. - Drop... the gun!
misfire.
she worked for the Company. - To you.
to a jury, she's Christina Hampton, Technology Consultant.
and because she was so good at hiding her true identity, we can't prove otherwise.
look, you all get exonerated it did not set well with law enforcement.
if they can make Sara pay for it, they will.
how much time is she looking at?
25 to life.
Miami-Dade penitentiary women's facility.
you. Over here.
you. Here.
you. Here.
this one's yours.
am I supposed to be in a different facility? - I don't think so.
I haven't been convicted of anything yet. I'm supposed to be in a jail. This is prison.
overcrowding and budget cuts, fish.
this is the jail. That's the prison.
Was'sup homey? You need some help?
you've got everything you need over there?
why don't you go help and make her bed?
don't let them spook you. They just like to intimidate.
they are good at it.
look.
this jail-prison hybrid thing's B. S.
come on. The other one's practically empty.
you can ride it out to your court date there.
thank you.
here. This should be a little bit more comfortable for you.
okay.
what's going on?
you know...
at first, I couldn't place your name.
Tancredi. It sounded so familiar.
but then, Haggs here, figure it out.
I remember your pretty face from the papers.
you are not going anywhere, fish. This is going to happen.
half a dozen guards lost their jobs and pensions at Fox River.
another dozen were put on probation, after you decided to leave the door open for your boyfriend and his seven convict pals.
and we... ain't gonna let anything like that happen again.
don't worry, we won't hit the baby basket.
looked like that welcome wagon ran over your face.
it looks that way, huh?
alright, well...
if you need something, you just ask for me.
everybody calls me "Daddy."
special delivery.
you know, all we need is a little cash, spread around in places.
I told you. The government's exposing my assets.
you tellin' me you can't get your hands on the cash?
I mean, that's the least you can do.
considering you're gonna kill me not too long ago.
goodbye, Theodore.
you ain't never been incarcerated before, and I never been incarcerated here before,
now let's just say this handicapped connie got the juicy hand back in Fox River.
your pathetic existence here can be ameliorated.
as can my life, all with a little "Roberto De Niro."
one of our friends has been apprehended by the authorities.
looks like we've got a new neighbour.
I'm never gonna get out of this prison alive. I know that.
I wanna bring my enemy down with me.
I want her... Dead.
100，000 dead
either way, it's going to require a capital.
a capital you no longer have.
my rainy day plan. You know where it is.
Jonathan. I'd assume that that would be use for your defense.
it's good money at the bad, Joe.
they're not gonna let me out of here.
no matter how many shots that I have.
get that. To our friend, in the sister cells, across the compound.
excuse me.
bad move.
last time someone touched her, they got a crack kneecap.
you're much braver than I gave you credit for.
either that, or you're amazingly naive.
do I look like I wanna talk to you?
I just say, a woman in your position laid up for some protection.
join the prison gang? I don't think so.
not a gang. No.
a family.
they don't call her "Daddy" for nothin'.
that's her wife.
and those are her kids.
are you okay? - Stay the hell away from me.
I need the infirmary.
can't go down to the infirmiary without the release form.
I'm having muscle contractions on my throat. And my jaws tightening up.
it's just--It's just couldn't be indigestions, I'm poisoned.
no. That's government cheese. You'll get used to it.
if I don't get to the hospital in the next 15 minutes,
I will die and my baby will die. Please.
boss.
why don't you let her go see the doc?
please.
this is Kaorla. We have an inmate going into the infirmary.
you and your baby are gonna be okay.
well then, you need to talk to the warden about it.
then how about talking to me about your face?
you want to tell me how that happened?
I caught an elbow playing basketball.
we should discuss your... situation.
as I'm sure you've ascertain this isn't going to be a run-of-the-mill pregnancy.
can I deliver in here?
no. The day we're induced, we'll secure you in an ambulance.
we'll take you to St. Lucia down the road.
we'll cordone off a room.
there'll be 3 armed guards in there with me, when you give birth.
do I get to see my baby?
you'll have 30 minutes before we take it away.
I've seen this process a dozen times.
after the mothers come back here, the depression's almost unbearable.
my advice, it's a lot less messy, if you'd just think of yourself as a surrogate.
yeah?
Michael, this Lou Phillips.
your wife had an incident earlier today.
someone tried to poison her.
what are you talking about?
Michael, I need you to focus.
do you have any idea who might have done this?
go ahead, let him in.
if I had a list of all the people who might come to visit me,
your name will be at the bottom,
somewhere below Jesus Christ and Scooby Doo.
someone tried to poison Sara today. - Mercy
only you would be depraved enough, to think that killing an innocent woman and an unborn child will bring you some kind of peace before your execution.
Sara is with child?
Congratulations!
this is like the 4th of July and Christmas day rolled into one.
I am asking you, father to father, to leave her alone.
you can kill me if you want to kill me,
I'll trade my life for hers.
but leave Sara alone.
if you were killed, your pain will last a moment.
if Sara were killed, your pain will last the rest of your life.
now that's got to be appealing to whoever who put out this hit.
but don't worry, Michael.
if I find out anything, I'll be sure to let you know.
prison life can be tough.
if I remember correctly, you have two missing toes that can attest to that bag.
I don't think you understand. She's not safe here!
please.
please just approve the transfer to another facility.
if I grant her a transfer, everybody's gonna want one.
what about segregrated housing?
is there something that I should know about the structural integrity of shoe?
I can see where this is going.
I know who you are.
and I'm not going to let you turn my prison into the next Fox River.
all I'm trying to do, is keep my wife alive.
you do know she's pregnant.
I don't care.
here.
Thanks. - In case I haven't made myself clear
Sara Tancredi is not getting any preferential treatment.
and you've made yourself perfectly clear. Thank you for your time.
what happened? - The General wants Sara dead
and the warden's just gonna let that happen.
we gotta lure in her case and needs to get her out, right?
which is not enough time.
if she stays in that prison, someone's going to kill her.
I guess we don't have a choice.
we're breaking her out.
in my 16 years in the Bureau,
I've worked cases under 43 different agents.
as one of those 43 agents, I can't help but feel a bit offended.
because obviously, I am not as honoured as this drive addicted murderer.
Alex has been clean and sober for four months.
and he's been completely exonerated of all crimes associated with his involvement with the Company.
that doesn't include the shooting and the murder of one Oscar Shales - and burying his body under his bird bath-- - That is just an allegation
let's move on, shall we?
all those in favor of reinstating Alexander Mahone, a Special Agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation
Aye.
all those oppose? - Alright, alright, I've
thank you for the invite, Richard.
it's always a pleasure.
you know, Alex. This ruling can't be revisited.
if you're able to sufficiently demonstrate, just how committed you are to a life of service.
now, as you may know, Sara Tancredi was arrested recently, and is currently being house at the Miami Dade State Penitentiary.
we have concerns that Michael Scofield may have other plans for her.
so this-- this is why you're invite me in here.
well obviously, if Scofield were, to be able to pull off this plot of another breakout, the public embarassment will be immensed to the Bureau.
so... having someone to get us a credible information, that would be worth something to us.
agent Whitley is set up in Miami. He will be your contact.
you're something else.
now...
we both know...
how badly you want that badge back.
give me a reason to give it to you.
what's your plan after we break her out? We're on the run again?
first thing first. Let's get her out of there.
hey papi.
the fed that arrested Sara, is outside, staking us out.
look, if you're worried about getting into trouble again, go back to Chicago, go back to your family.
I'll understand.
are you kidding me?
after all the crap we've been through, I'm just going to leave you here and Sara in there?
you shut up and don't bring it up again.
what's all that? - Newspaper clippings
covering 7 different escape attempts from Miami Dade's State Pen
over the last 60 years.
none of them successful.
so we weigh them all, and we learn what not to do.
well the prison officials learned a lot,
they re-evaluated, they retrofitted,
the prison's pratically escape-proof.
are you alright? - I'm fine
I guess so if we can't go through, what if we go down?
like down into the prison? We--we parachute in.
Yeah.
Yeah. You parachute in, we find her-- - Are you kidding?
I'm serious-- - That's suicide!
newspapers clippings only going to get us so far.
we need some more information about the prison.
so let's do some recon work.
camera, electronic tape measure, dry ice. What's this?
it's a shopping list.
you need to come with me, doc.
I have a doctor's appointment for my pregnancy in a few minutes.
it'll wait.
in here.
hold it.
I don't know what you want, but I promise you, I won't go down and fight it.
damn baby, I ain't gonna hurt you.
hell, I ain't even gonna touch you.
see, I run the motor pool detail in here.
and I was thinkin' if you want to get yourself a little fresh air, and not have to worry about getting stab in the back, then you could come in, work with me...
you're the fed from my wedding.
Yeah, you can call me Agent Whitley.
I could call you a lot of things.
where are you headed? - Sea World.
sea World? There isn't one in Miami.
my loss. - No. What really be your loss, is getting your wife killed, by doing something stupid.
are you threatening Sara? - No, no. Not at all
I'm just saying that if you gonna try and revoke her sentence.
bullets fly, Michael.
and if she'd get hurt, that'll be on you.
funny hearing that from the guy who put her in prison in the first place.
no, I didn't put her in prison. State of Florida did.
it's just my job to make sure that she stays there.
so ah...
Where's all your little buddies?
alright. Drop in some more dry ice.
fence line is 4 feet... from the road.
and 32 feet... from the east camera.
hurry up. They're gonna see the laser. - I'm going as fast as I can, papi
he followed you? - Yeah, but he's gone now
you guys almost done?
almost. - Great. I'll meet you back at the loft
Miami-Dade Med-first Clinic
well, you're just a natural.
I bet you are a hell of a surgeon.
handing out condoms to cons were makin' you no damn surgeon!
what in the hell is the matter with you?
you ain't even ask me if she can come...
one day, for real! Can we go one day without your mouth? One!
let it be today.
I'm sorry. You've got to forgive my old lady, she's...
you just a little bit easy on eyes, you know?
she's just the jealous type.
crazy is the type she's more like it.
what? You're gonna watch your tone, Agatha.
sorry
or you want me take off my belt? - Sorry
kids.
it's rough. It's hard running a family.
it's important though that, uh-- That you have one
I have a family. I have a husband.
Oh, you've got a husband? Is he here?
they let you bring it in here, with you, when you came?
no.
Yeah, I had a husband too.
18 years is a long time to wait.
so, you know. If this ain't for you, that's cool.
then you pick up that nasty oil, take it out and put it in the repository.
okay.
we gotta go, bro.
take your hands off me. - When I'm good and ready.
what's Burrows doing at the fence?
please don't make me ask you again, Sara.
nobody here that'll help you but yourself. Are you going to answer me?
you tried to kill me.
line it up, cons. Go back inside.
you, get back to your detail. Now!
I want you to pass along an offer to your boy.
what he's paying his people to dust that Tancredi chicken bitch pop, my woman are good for a cut rate.
just what kind of discount are you proposing here?
tell him.
if he's offering a 100 grand, my girl will take 30.
no, 40. 40.
perfect.
I'll tell him.
Hey, five stars.
so you have no cash, whatsoever...
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of that broken record.
got it. I won't ask again.
Oh, to what do we owe the honor?
I've been thinking...
well, no need to be uh, shy. Just spit it out.
I've change my mind.
no, well maybe Daddy change her mind.
maybe she don't want you here no more.
sports right. I recently rolled up my welcome mat. Peace.
please. - Please, what?
please, may I be a part of your family?
take a walk.
take a walk!
I would love that. I would-- sit down. I really would.
you see, its not that easy. It's just saying "I do."
see, in order to make a commitment... to a family,
it's something you gotta prove.
that's right, we all did it.
it's a commitment... to the family code.
it's a code you gotta wear.
what's up? - How are you doing, man?
what's going on?
we gotta talk.
alright.
they're watching you.
we know. We gotta a fed on us. - No. Not just one.
the whole department.
sounds a lot like inside information, Alex.
what you do? Make a deal with the feds?
they offered me my old job back, if I came down here to spy on you.
now the fed you're talking about, his name is Whitley.
he's running point.
so now we know.
so if you really gonna do this, you gotta do it right.
and I'll help you if you need me.
what else do you get?
Sara's working the motor pool today at 4 o'clock.
motor pool is here.
this hold by two security cameras, along the perimeter of the prison.
what about secondary entrances? - No loading dock, no personnel entrance
fences?
15 feet high, covered with rave wires.
Electrified? - No. Why?
if Sara can get herself back to motor pool,
I think we can find a way inside.
with all the different retrofits over the years, the fence line is widened.
but security cameras remain exactly where they've always been.
they've never accounted for the difference.
there's a blindspot. - Yeah. Right here
if Sara can get back to that spot, we can breach the fence.
it's risky, Michael.
that's all we've got.
how much time to tell Sara where we going to meet her?
how? We've got no visitations, no phone calls.
it's clean. Take it to Tancredi.
remember when I taught you about flowers?
I wish I was with you now.
to see you holding one in your hand.
to see you holding one in your hand.
tomorrow. PM. Seven. Oil dump.
sure looks like you've been busy. - Do you have a warrant, Agent Whitley?
a warrant? No, I don't need one.
my testimony will be your brother let me in.
once inside, saw all this evidence, right in plain sight.
what judge gonna take your word over mine?
what evidence?
those pictures were taken from public property.
that prison, was paid for by the taxpayers.
so all you have evidence of, is an exonerated citizen, standing on a public road, taking pictures of a public building.
last I checked, it's not a crime.
what if I said that I could get you on attempt, just for having all these stuff?
what if I told you that all this was peace offering?
the warden won't let me see my wife.
so I figured, if I found a few lapse in the security, pointed them out as a gesture of good faith, she might change her mind?
is that so? Find anything yet?
no. Looks airtight.
well thank goodness for that.
you guys will let me know if anything comes up, right?
you'll be the first to know.
on the outside, I was known for getting the job done.
no matter what.
I got paid well for it.
now I'm broke. But I still need things.
like what? - A favor.
I don't do favors for cons.
Really? It's not what it says on the bathroom walls.
as I understand, you'd do favors for those who reciprocate.
is that true?
this is bullshit, Boss! I'm a veteran around here.
ain't no reason to toss me!
you low leaf!
looky, looky here.
No! That brown ain't mine, boss. You know this!
I do no drugs!
who put that in here?!
you ugh--! Take your hands off me. I know where the hold is.
what y'all looking at?
I do no drugs! Somebody is going down there!
I love you too.
Sofia's making arrangements in Central America.
once we break Sara, we're on the boat, we're gone.
Hey. - It's Lou.
just got a decision from the court.
they're ordering the warden to allow supervised visitations.
where are you going? - They're letting me Sara.
pera, pera, pera, pera
if you going to be listening to every word you say, you gotta be careful about this.
if she understood my letters, she'll find a way to tell me.
how? She's going to blink the Morse code?
Oh my God!
Oh my God! Who did this to you?
I'm okay. Baby's okay.
Sara, I'm so sorry. You're in here because of me.
I'm sorry. This is hard.
I miss you so much - No touching
I miss you too.
you just have to hang in there, okay?
I'm trying. But my protection's gone.
did you get my letter? - I did.
I know sometimes it's hard for me to express what I want to say.
but I hope you understood... what I meant to tell you.
I did.
isn't he cute?
you were there for me. And I will be there for you.
okay. - Alright, that's it.
time's up.
see you soon.
Bye.
I was thinking a lot.
about the photos and the mock-up that you showed me at the loft.
and I ran a few tests.
lo and behold, I've found a blindspot.
right along the fence line over here, due to our retrofit.
you didn't know about this, did you? No, no of course not.
because you would've told me or the warden about it if you did, right?
well, it's a good thing I found this when I did, in case anyone tries to escape.
well if we can't go through the fence, then that leaves under or over.
look, how she gonna climb that fence without being seen? Huh?
I'm guessing there's no telephone wire for her to climb across.
then she's gotta go under. - Alright, lets get some shovels
what was that you were saying about parachutes?
parachutes
guys, come on. You can be ser-- Parachutes?
couple of thoughts on that. A - We don't have a plane,
b - We don't have a pilot.
have you ever worn a parachute? - Don't worry, I think I've got a plan.
but we're gonna need some help from an old friend.
who?
you want a favor from me. - Just hear me out.
of course. I mean, when you and Michael send me back to that prison, you did give me a piece of chewing gum.
I mean what kind of man will I be if I don't quit your pro-quote?
look,
all you gotta do is sound off the fire alarm, in here
tomorrow night at 7: 30.
that's it.
you're breaking her out. - Krantz has put a hit on her, that's a one shot, of keeping her alive.
well you're on a pivoted kind of damn, Lincoln.
we'll put 5 grand on your cake once this whole thing jumps off.
the love of Michael's life is only worth of $ 5, 000?
that's the best we can do.
I need six figures. - That's all we got
Alackaday for you, I know somebody who does... the general's man.
he's got the payout for Sara's hit.
you wire that money to me by 7pm tomorrow, and we're in business.
what is his name?
it's your brother to you that agony is.
come on, you gotta give me more than that. - Tomorrow. 7pm. Go on, fetch.
you should have seen the look on Michael's face.
when he saw me fixing that fence and installing that camera.
you did a great job.
job's over now.
if Michael has this misguided belief that Sara's life is in danger, he's gonna find a way back into that prison.
your job will be over until you give us enough evidence to put him back behind bars.
so what's the latest?
there's nothing concrete.
but I'll let you know when I get something.
alright. Good man.
tough going alone.
I know he's breaking you out. I'm coming with you.
relax. Krantz sent me to kill you, but after what he's put me through, I'm done taking orders from him.
you're sitting next to me at the mess when I was poisoned.
you'd think you would've lasted this long if I wanted you dead?
I want you dead. You're still alive.
don't you think it's hard to stay alive when you know who's coming after you?
there's 200 women in this prison. Bet do you even get to Gen Pop?
I'm coming with you.
or nobody's going.
well, if you're watching this, I'm glad.
because that means you're safe.
how does he think he's gonna do this, bro? - He's going to jump out of the plane.
I know he's gonna jump. The question is, can he land?
not without getting caught.
and how is he going to get out of cell block, even if T-Bag
it's a big "if." Trusting T-Bag is... crazy.
Michael, we uh-- we really have to re-think this.
I have. And there's no other way.
okay.
I'm going to drop down into this outer area here.
and I cut the parachute off before anyone can reach me.
they're going to be right on your ass.
I can hide behind this building, wait for a window.
then I'll make my way over here.
that's the chapel. Well hopefully uh-- Sara will be waiting.
why the chapel?
during the riot in '88, prison employees escaped through the administration building.
they wound up here, outside the fence.
the administration building, is connected to the chapel.
which means that somewhere in that compound, there is a subterranean exit.
if we can get through it, you can meet us there.
how's Sara gonna get to the chapel? - She'll have to find a way.
look, we're doing this at 7pm tonight, just like we've planned.
where have you been? - What did I missed?
I need you to find a plane and a pilot.
and you two, to take care of T-Bag.
find out exactly who has this money, and where they're keeping it.
and then we have to get it. - By 7pm tonight.
or Sara's going to die in there.
is everybody onboard?
okay.
tell me, you've completed your assignment.
well, I got the cash. But there'll may be some delay in final delivery.
the woman we hired is having trouble getting near Sara Tancredi.
then hire somebody else. Call it open season.
put a bounty on her head. I don't care how you do it.
I want Sara Tancredi dead by the end of the day.
open cells! One hour!
we're about to play cards, do you want in?
I'm okay. Thanks.
you should.
with Daddy gone, you're gonna need your backup.
hell, we all did.
I've got uh-- a pre-natal thing. - It's cool.
Thanks.
not too smart though, for a girl with a bounty on her head.
aren't you heard?
Tancredi, you have a visitor.
say hello to your husband for me.
what's wrong?
look, um...
I know you don't have any control over what's happened here, but uh
things aren't working out.
okay.
I'm trying to find a way to-- To do... this.
but from where we're standing right now, there's only one option.
do you need more time... to think?
no. No, it's not about that.
I've made up my mind. Cause there's nothing you could do about it.
except... pray for us tonight.
pray for us?
you can pray for us to be together.
maybe I'll do the same.
how can I rob someone if I've no clue who he is?
the logbook outside says that Krantz had one visitor yesterday.
a Joe Daniels.
well if he was in the power deduction, I'd say, Daniels is your bagman.
you know how many Daniels live Miami? Thousands. I need more.
well you better get crackin', cause if I ain't get that money by 7 o'clock, you ain't got your fire, you ain't got your fire alarm.
and that means Pretty ain't got his Mrs. Pretty.
listen my friend, you're in no position to makin' demands
okay, shh
I ain't talking about backing out the deal.
I put my ear on the ground and come up with some details.
good.
and now, fetch.
we've got a pilot.
there's a guy I'd busted 20 years ago, running drugs across the Gulf.
went legit. Went to charter business now.
he must've jumped out of a few planes, huh?
Yes, several. Some for sport. Some necessity.
it's a big difference, Michael.
it's not easy hitting the X, especially at night.
don't worry. I can go alone.
what do you got? - It's a test.
see, the prison was built in the mid-80's, so that exit in the administration building is probably protected by an electronic code of lock, modified by a security card.
those locks don't have power protection, which means you can overwrite them.
then you can't just go to the building, shut it and blow it out?
no.
1200 volt power surge will just set off the other alarms.
not to mention that it'll kill you.
so we have to find another way. - Yeah
Yeah.
talk to me, Mahone. What have you got?
nothing yet. - I don't need updates on the hour.
I need evidence, intent. It's not crap.
call me when he's in the process of committing a crime.
Yeah.
I'm not going to let him walk away from me like he did from you.
it's going down if I've got to shoot him in the back.
sorry.
are we friends now?
get out of the way! What happened here?!
I didn't see anything, sir.
move!
bad news.
Agatha Warren is dead.
who did that? - No one's talking.
but I hear it says fish. Tancredi and Morgan.
No!
No!
there he is.
if you don't like this guy, we can still find someone else.
good to see you, Sni.
what you get into here, Mahone?
jumping off 1500 feet ain't going to be easy.
you've gone back on your word already?
let's not forget who's doing who a favor here.
favor?
favor that I bust your old lady for traficking. No, I did not.
if anyone asks, I was flying tourists to the Keys, - And it's not my fault they jumped. - Sounds good to me.
if you don't like this guy, we'd take a day - We come up with a new plan. - No, there's no time, Alex.
it's not just Sara's life at risk. - I understand that.
I know you do. That's why I also know I can ask for your help.
Yeah. What do you need? - If I don't make it
I want you to make sure Sara and my brother get out of the country alive.
I need to know they're gonna be okay.
and I'm gonna trust that you'll do everything you can to make that happen.
take this.
I trust you, Alex.
remember that.
special delivery.
what is it? - I don't exactly know.
it came via messenger from uh-- the lady side.
my man on the outside needs to know who to call for the birthday present.
who's birthday is it?
well see to it that it gets back to the same place.
will do.
so this is Joe Daniels number, right?
is that enough information or you need a social security number too?
that'll do. - Remember
I want that money wired to the account number specified.
no wire, no fire.
you boys do me wrong,
I have no qualms at all about singing it loud and clear, you understand?
you know what? Just be ready.
[Speaking SPANISH]
that was Sofia.
she'll meet you at San Andreas harbor in Dominican Republic and then - you guys can fly to Costa Rica. - Cool.
I know where Daniels is.
and after we rob him, I'll take the money to Quik Green and uh
wire to the bank.
you will meet us at the airstrip, right? - Might give a shot now.
okay. This is it.
we're ready.
Thanks, buddy.
for everything.
good luck, papi. See you on the other side.
nobody's talking, huh? Girl's dead. No one's said any?
I made it in the workshop.
want to give to my daughter Emily a birthday gift on her actual birthday.
so I need to get out of here.
you're never sentimental. - Oh, I'm not. It's just for her.
we need to get to the chapel.
we?
there's no way out of here right now. I'm gonna need you.
yeah?
Mr. Daniels, American Paint Company here for the job.
well, this is Mr. Daniels but I didn't order any painters.
it's Wednesday, sir. I believe you did.
hold it right there. I'm calling the police.
get out!
this is it.
I'll be right back. Gotta get that parachute.
come here.
there's a better way.
mess! Mess, half hour.
little faster. We don't have all day.
let's go!
got any ideas?
Yeah. Keep your head down and follow me. I'll think of something.
you better think of something fast, 'cause we have company.
I hope you're ready for a fight, princess.
this one's to the death.
do you think you can overpower her?
Yeah. I don't think it's her you have to worry about.
just be ready.
Hello? - It's me.
I've got the message about the birthday present?
was the gift earned? - What in the hell are you talking about?
the birthday present! - Birthday present?
two guys showed up at my house, they took the money and they beat the crap out of me.
howdy, General.
I just thought of let you know how I came up with some green.
my personal preference is two Zegna bars and a copy of the Times.
so I see you in the AM?
you worthless son of a whore. Go to hell!
careful I don't get there first.
unless I become the king of that prison, too.
alright, from takeoff, the prison's gonna come up real fast.
so whatever you gotta do to get ready, do it now.
you get it.
we've got the money.
sucre's just dropped me off on the way to wire it.
good. That means T-Bag's set.
I'm goin' to see how long it's gonna take and we get going.
you sure that thing's gonna hold you up? - Yes, it'll be fine.
what about you?
this is not my first time inside a prison.
but hopefully... Will be my last.
think about all the amazing stories that you're gonna tell your kid.
you're gonna be the type of father our dad never was.
someone to look up to.
take care, Michael.
unless you've got details, I'm hanging up.
and you can forget about getting your badge back.
he's got a plane. He's got a parachute into the yard.
what? - I swear to God, he's gonna be over prison airspace at 7 o'clock.
call in reinforcements. I want 20 armed COs in the yard.
and be ready to turn off all exterior lights.
Scofield won't see what's coming, until it's too late.
and bring me Sara Tancredi.
wait, wait.
what do you think happened with Agatha, it's not what happened.
I need to make this right with you, okay?
go ahead.
I was hoping I'd see you here.
you know I still owe you one big juicy favor.
later, blue eyes.
I swear to God she wanted to kill me and I was just defending myself.
you remember that? - Yes, I do.
my momma gave me that.
told me I was going to give it to one of my kids one day.
not only did I get knocked up, but the girl in the family...
and I practically raised Agatha and she was no killer.
now I can say that much for myself.
you didn't know what I had in mind yet.
okay, listen, you're right. Agatha isn't a killer.
she was just a-- real bitch with a bit of more than she need to.
skittles.
okay.
we cool. We cool. We cool, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kaorla. She'd want you to bring Tancredi to her office.
a'ight? Okay.
son of a bitch!
they coming right through here, okay?
federal agent Todd Whitley. I need to get inside right now.
emergency team takes priority, sir.
I'm the leader of the emergency team. Now let me inside.
sorry. Strict orders. - Go talk to your supervisor. Come on!
no weapons! Let the suburban through.
the plane should be overhead any minute.
Hey, fellas! Kill the lights.
as soon as he hits the ground, I want one of you to start firing.
standby.
we're standing by.
easy now. Hold your fire.
standby!
now!
let's go. Move in, men!
where the hell's Scofield?
emergency team takes priority, sir.
I'm the leader of the emergency team. Now let me inside right now.
I've strict orders. No one gets inside at this point, sir.
I don't know what your orders are. Go talk to your supervisor.
why isn't Tancredi in front of me right now?
we've just got the situation under control. We're looking for her right now.
Oh my God!
are you alright? - Yeah. It was Morgan.
check the kitchen. They might be in the kitchen.
I'm not gonna make it on my own.
either leave me with tools here or make up your damn mind.
are you gonna be able to make it? - Yeah.
okay. It's now.
alright, hold up.
Nah, I think we're good.
don't move!
stood on the dark, now! - Please, I just ...
on the ground!
you're here alone?
damn it, con. When I ask you a question, you answer.
is there anyone else here?
Yes.
who?
God. - Excuse me?
he's always here.
I was worried about my little girl on the outside.
so I came to pray. See if someone would watch over her.
go check it out.
the stove mess is open. Need support right now!
I've got to get these animals lockdown!
we better head over there.
I hope that daughter of yours - is hell a lot smarter than you. - So do I.
are you ready to go?
nobody gets in or out of this prison.
I don't care if it's the President having to take a piss, you tell him to turn the hell around.
get a team.
I want every inch of that fence line checked for points of compromise.
Yes, sir.
michael said this is where they're gonna come out.
you think Sucre make the drop on time?
I don't know.
no, no, no.
please enter your account number.
your account balance is zero dollars and zero cents.
if you would like to access another account
your account balance is zero dollars and zero cents.
what the hell you thinking you're doing, fish? We're in lockdown.
what for?
something's going on in bitch block. I don't know.
what's it worth to you to find out?
we're going to get through here?
on the other side is a kind of an escape patch for the administrators.
in case of a riot.
if this is the same system they have in Fox River, that door can only be open remotely from the Centre Control.
that's why we've gone and ask for help.
tell them what you told me.
michael Scofield is about to stage a prison break.
and I know exactly how he's gonna do it.
exactly what did Scofield asks you to do?
just light a fire in my cell.
and the rest... the rest will just take care of itself.
a fire alarm. If that goes off, what's your protocol?
state law, mandatory evac.
hell, he won't go break, I was goin' to get you and escort her out.
shut up! - Get him outta here.
alright, the evacuation's only going to get him out in the yard.
whatever he's up to, he needs noise and he needs chaos.
deactivate the smoke detection system, the fire alarm, and while you're at it, kill the horn.
if anybody so much as bends a blade of grass in this place,
I want him to be able to hear it.
why are we waiting for? - We made a deal.
with the right price, T-Bag will set off the fire alarms.
that's what we're waiting for.
Michael, there's a-- - It's okay.
see, there's only one thing you can count on when you're dealing with T-Bag.
he's a rat.
anything?
so far just a female inmate loose in the yard.
Tancredi? - No, Morgan. First name, Gretchen.
over by the chapel. - Alright.
alright.
great. Let's go.
okay, down there.
okay.
beyond this door should be a hundred yards of tunnel.
on the other end of that, is Linc, and after that, there's a boat mounted for the white sands and blue water.
a power surge to the system, will override the reader, for just a few seconds.
just long enough for you to open that, so get ready.
one more time.
I was afraid this might happen.
it's okay. It's alright.
we're going to keep moving and we're gonna find another way out of here.
I know what I have to do.
I need units to the chapel. Now!
where are they? - I don't know.
they should've been here by now.
the battery wasn't generating enough power.
we have to blow up the system for the whole building.
okay. What do you want to try?
this is the main fuse.
if I yanked that, everything will go dark for a second.
I reconnect these two cables...
if I reconnect these two cables, there'll be a lot of noise, every light bulb in this place is going to blow.
as soon as that happens, you need to open that hatch.
and I want you to start running.
okay. What about you?
someone has to stay here, and someone has to open the hatch.
and that someone's gotta be you.
okay. So I'll leave it open for you.
you don't understand.
this is the only way.
I'm not leaving unless you're coming with me.
but I am coming with you.
I love you.
God, I love you too.
go!
go, Sara. Go.
downstairs.
Where's Michael?
Sara, where is he? Where's Michael?
where is he?
he's not coming back.
he's not coming back.
what do you mean, he's not coming back? What do you mean by that?
he's not coming back.
he'll be here.
he's gone, Lincoln.
Linc, we've gotta go.
we've gotta go.
we've gotta go.
why am I being punished?! I'm the guy through the window!
you aided and abetted an escape, Mr. Bagwell.
and as far as the authorities are concerned, you're an accomplice.
michael asked me to give you this, if he didn't make it out.
he said it would help you understand why he did what he did.
it's his bloodwork.
brain tumor activity
this is the General's money.
I was supposed to wire it down to Costa Rica for you to pick up but uh,
I ran into some trouble.
I'm sorry.
you take care of that baby, okay?
you take care yours.
this is for you.
he never said anything to me.
why didn't he just tell me?
cause he knew you'll try to stop him.
he knew you do anything to protect your family.
but I didn't.
well...
you will soon.
take it easy.
thank you.
Yeah.
well, if you're watching this, I'm glad.
because that means you're safe.
and that's all I ever wanted.
I wish I could... be there with you.
but as you probably know now,
I wouldn't have much time anyway, so
I've made my choice, and
I don't regret it.
anyway, not too long from now, there's going to be another Scofield running around.
and Linc,
I want you to promise me, no matter what, they're going to grow up knowing their uncle is never far away.
and Sara,
I want you to promise me that you're gonna keep an eye on Linc.
as you may have notice, he has the tendency to get in trouble.
you know we spend so much of our lives, not saying the things we want to say.
the things we should say.
we speak in codes, we send little messages.
origami.
so now, plainly, simply,
I want to say that I love you both.
very much.
and I want you to promise me, that you're gonna tell my child, that you're gonna tell my child how much they're loved every day.
and remind them how lucky they are, to be free.
because we are.
we're free now.
finally.
we're free.
so, uh, surfing, huh? you're into surfing now?
you should see her room. she's got surf posters everywhere.
as soon as my heart is better, I'm gonna have
a birthday party on the beach, and I'm gonna learn how to surf.
I've been watching them from my window,
and it's totally cool. that sounds totally awesome.
so how's our patient doing? annie, this is dr. barnes.
Dr. barnes is going to remove the tumor from your heart.
what happened to the other guy?
this guy's much better than the other guy.
Dr. Barnes is the best heart guy in L. A. .
this is gonna be your last surgery. that's how good he is.
and so I snagged him for you because I'm on your side. right?
right. well, it is a 6-hour procedure, so we should probably get going.
right, annie? -you'll be here when I come out?
I'll be here.
don't look so scared. it's gonna be fine.
finishing or starting?
finishing. you?
starting. mm.
I've got myocardial resection on a kid.
I hate working on kids.
I feel like I'm holding my breath the entire time.
Yeah. I know what you mean. I work on babies sometimes.
Oh. so you, uh, so you come here often?
was
that actually sounded like a-- was that a pickup line?
no. no?
that, uh, I apologize.
okay.
besides, I would, um...
I would give a better pickup line than that.
hello. hello. hel-- I'm--i'm not into this.
the bug needs stimulation. I'm the pediatrician.
this is my area. hello, little one.
hello. hey, guys.
I'm stimulating the bug. we've made a decision.
together? paternity test, now.
one of us gets out of your hair,
the other one has a right to know. look, guys
you know what, cooper? you moved in, you pushed us out,
you've claimed your territory, but one thing is clear
this kid you're talking to is not yours
so stay out of it. look, pete
the answer is right there for us to know.
we know that you don't want to face it, but we do.
I've gotta go.
well...
I have no defining exit line,
so...
they told me it was a carjacking.
they told you? you don't remember?
I remember leaving soccer practice.
I'd parked across campus in student parking.
I got to my car. there were people around.
I pulled out my keys,
and I heard a noise behind me, and...
And?
that's all I remember. woke up in the ambulance.
I loved that car.
I love shotgun.
this guy came into my world and... oh, I'm pissed.
I'd like you to see our psychiatrist dr. turner.
Really? 'cause other than pissed, I'm okay.
just... do me the favor so you stay that way.
you know what'll make me okay?
when they catch this guy.
are you snooping?
uh, this is public space. I'm just standing here.
snooping. -do you want to know what's going on or not?
of course I do.
okay, possible baby daddies demanded paternity test.
Whew.
said my name during sex with her. no!
okay, wait a minute.
how do you know all this, just by watching?
what, do you read lips now? -well, no, sam told me the whole name thing.
wh-- what? we are friends.
he tells me stuff. we're just friends.
and violet was yelling so loud, it just...
Oh, god. he called out your name.
don't-- I'm the only person that the man has had sex with
in the last 15 years.
it was just habit. that's all. mm-hmm.
we're just friends. do you know what I'm saying? it's incredible.
I wish someone would call out
another woman's name in bed with me.
hell, I'd even take not knowing who the father of my baby was.
either way, it would mean that I'd had a man on top of me In recent history.
you know what? that's really sad.
I know. I thought somebody was trying to pick me up... mm-hmm.
an-and I felt my knees open just a little bit. uh, come on.
I don't want to spoil the fun,
but I've got betsey with me today,
and "say my name" and "who's your daddy"
are getting a little loud, and I don't want to have to
explain what a paternity test is to my 6 year old.
I'm not telling 'em to shut up. oh, no, no, me neither.
I will have a paternity test
when I want to have a paternity test.
you can't do one for a few weeks anyway.
who do they think they are, telling me what to do?
it's my body. it's my uterus. -you cat do one for a few weeks anyway.
I mean, yes, yes, I was... a little bit irresponsible,
having unprotected sex with two men,
but does that give them the right to dictate violet, you can't do a C. V. S. paternity test for a few weeks.
the point is mute.- moot.
the point is moot. is it "moot"? I'm pretty sure it's "mute."
no, it's moot. the point is moot.
I can't have a paternity test for weeks.
I didn't come here to...
I need you to see a patient. -is the point mootor is the point
Annie's out of surgery.
Where's the patient?
you were in bed with me,
and you called out another woman's name. I know, and, uh, it was wrong,
but i-i was not thinking about her.
I-i--it just slipped out. i-i promise.
Sonya, what-- please, what are you well, I have to go to work.
and you've explained yourself as best you could, I guess.
well, have a good day, sonya.
see? There. Sonya. See? I- I know it.
it's a beautiful name. sonya. sonya. son
you're just in the doghouse, you know?
you're just gonna have to suffer,
just for a little bit.
maybe I should make her dinner tonight,
you know, go all out-- candlelight, flowers, the works.
no, no, no, no, no. you need to take her out.
take her out somewhere nice, somewhere romantic.
the blue sea in Malibu.
the blue sea, the place we used to go?
Yeah, the place with the great mimosas -That you drank way too many of. the blue sea. yeah, that s-sounds perfect.
the memory loss is not unusual,
and it's not necessarily a bad thing.
you're protecting yourself. I don't want to protect myself.
I want to remember.
the memory may come out naturally, - When you're ready to deal with it. - I'm ready to deal with it.
I want to help the police find this guy,
and I can't unless I remember. I don't want to be a victim.
I want to find this guy and rip his throat out.
okay.
close your eyes.
okay.
so I want you to think about something you like.
Griffith park. I like riding horses.
good.
so I want you to see it in your mind,
like you're sitting in a movie theater
watching it on a screen.
describe what you see.
the horse is chestnut
with a white streak down the side of his neck.
we're riding off the trail, up a hill,
then we cut through some trees, cantering.
good.
so you're relaxed, and you're feeling that,
only the picture on the screen is going to change.
focus on the screen.
you see your car, you see yourself.
okay.
now don't bring everything into focus,
and you can look away anytime you need to.
but do you see anything about the attacker?
his arm... his hand.
he was white. the guy was white.
I can remember this, can't i?
you can help me remember?
I'll try.
it always starts with the cramping.
my husband and I can't go through this again.
I-I didn't even tell him this time because i
we just can't take losing another
well, miscarrying once is hard enough.
but twice must be-- we're not even telling friends and family
about this baby this time.
I think I know why you're cramping.
the placenta is implanting low on the uterine wall,
and that can cause bleeding as the pregna is that dangerous?
well, it can be unless we can do something about it,
and in this case, you can. -sure. what? anything.
no sex. no sex is the treatment?
Mm-hmm. really?
Yep.
Oh, wow. okay.
so... no sex.
Oh, we'll just spend our evenings reading...
and talking and not having sex.
well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not having any sex either.
Annie, your tumor was bigger than we expected.
we weren't able to remove all of it. but dr. barnes thinks
that more chemo will shrink this tumor,
and in another month, he can take it out completely.
that's what you said last time
and the time before that.
and then this was supposed to help.
but none of it helps.
just more hospitals... more medication,
staying inside all the time.
I don't want anymore.
don't talk like that. it'll be okay. you'll see.
no, it won't. I don't want anymore surgery.
please.
you promised you were on my side.
tell them no more surgery
finishing or starting?
finishing. you?
starting.
our timing.
my pickup lines are usually just honesty.
I don't have any lines.
okay.
for instance?
honesty? --honesty.
you are breathtakingly beautiful.
that's what I'd say,
you know, if I were trying to pick you up.
how s that?
th-that was good.
you missed the window.
for the C. V. S. test.
the risks of puncturing the placenta-- minimal.
Yes, but it's--it's there. violet.
paternity, c. v.s. window, it's--it's--it's gone. she missed the window.
so amnio? you're far enough along for an amnio.
well, there are risks to.
uh, okay. I'll consider it.
and, uh, while you're at it, will you consider
backing off with jill?
she's in my office, and her body is a mess.
her muscle pain is unreal. well, she's injured.
she--she was injured before the attack.
you were treating her. for a rotator cuff tear. she was getting better.
her treatment was nearly done.
since the attack-- her injuries are not muscular.
pullg up those memories, that's what's eating at her.
if I can walk her through the attack,
then I can desensitize her to the memory.
but then you run the risk of retraumatizing her,
which her body tells me is what's happenin you should be careful.
with a trauma,
if she internalizing--i've seen people get really sick. okay, so now
you're ganging up on me about everything?
I'm doing what's best for jill.
are there bumps along the way? yes.
but in the end, it's best that she knows now.
she wants to get this guy who did this to her.
so if she remembers, she can put him away
and have her life back. oh, that's interesting.
sometimes you think it's better to know.
and others... denial works for you.
Jill?
Jill what is it?
the man who attacked me, they think they found him.
they want me to come in for a lineup.
hello.
your face is all scowly.
Scowly?
well, you didn't lig up as soon as you saw me.
this is me, lit.
Hey, charlotte, what... what's wrong?
I mean, you've been kind of...
we've been in a better place, right? we started fresh?
Yes. I slept with archer, and you forgave me.
better place, fresh start.
But?
but nothing. everything's fine.
we're in a good place, coop, really.
Hey.
you're looking
don't tell me I look good, dr. freedman.
because I don't.
okay, thanks.
well, here's some good news.
I just looked over your labs,
and the chemo is doing what it's supposed to.
it's getting you ready for the surgery. -the chemo is making me sick.
I've tried to tell my parents I don't want this surgery,
but they won't listen to me. I know this is hard,
but you gotta try to hang in there. hang in for what?
I know what dr. barnes wants to do for me.
the surgery stinks. only 20% of the people who have it
live for more than six months. and that can be you.
I know I'm sick,
and my heart is really bad,
and if I do nothing, I'm gonna die.
but this surgery?
chances are it's not gonna work.
and if I was off this medicatn,
I could really feel good for a little bit.
I could play with my friends again.
if I had this out of my arm...
I could go in the ocean.
I could be normal for a little bit.
I'd rather have one good day
than be sick for the rest of my life.
the bleeding started this morning? yes, in the shower.
I've been doing everything you told me
no sex, taking it easy.
I even cut back my hours at work.
this shouldn't be happening. well, the placenta previa hasn't improved.
so I'm just gonna keep losing babies...
one after another after another?
Morgan, morg, look at me. you are stressed.
and if you're stressed, then the baby's stressed.
you are not going to lose this baby.
it just means that we need to be more aggressive, okay?
I'm gonna put you on total bed rest for the remainder
of your pregnancy,
and then I'm gonna watch you very carefully. i-i want an amnio.
if I'm gonna lay on my back for five months,
I-I need to know this baby's gonna be okay,
you know, that there aren't any genetic defects.
an amnio is usually done at 17 weeks, morgan.
we need to wait another month. what if
no what-ifs. we're gonna wait.
we're gonna do the amnio at the right time.
Hi, honey.
uh, yes, I'm at the doctor's office.
she's putting me on bed rest.
she's not letting me into the bed.
there's no sex.
and you need sex.
Yeah.
I mean, hey, I'm grown.
dinners are cool, restaurants are cool,
but she has me sleeping on the floor. Oh, god. Come on, sam.
be smart. you gotta change the scenery.
you gotta make her forget what happened.
you gotta... take her away to--I don't
take her to the grand spa in palm springs. I remember we had a really good time there.
exactly. that first weekend after maya, just the two of us.
we certainly forgot about everything.
Yeah, that was great. that was fun. mm-hmm.
I have maya this weekend, though. oh, I will take maya. you go.
go have fun. go whisk her away.
go. whisk.
we don't know what to do.
she's miserable and sick, and she doesn't want this.
and she makes sense, but she's only 12.
she still loves stuffed animals.
she giggles when she has to talk to boys.
anytime there's thunder, she comes to sleep between us.
I don't want to lose her, but I can't stand forcing her
to do something that she doesn't want to do.
you really think you can help her? I know it's hard, watching her.
but I think if I operate, there's a chance she'll make it.
a chance.
you don't think she should have the surgery?
I don't wanna... this is your decision.
I'm asking you. please.
I think even in the best-case scenario,
it's months in a hospital, constant drug therapies
and interventions, and this is not about a cure.
however, considering the alternative...
wait a minute. Go on, Dr. Cooper.
I want to know what you think.
um... I think annie has considered the alternative.
and even though it terrifies us, for her,
the alternative means having a life,
a real life like other kids,
even if it's just for a little while.
you know, playing outside and maybe going surfing and...
instead of spending her life...
in that little room we have down the hall.
it means celebrating her birthday
somewhere other than here.
in the future, we will be able to treat people
with annie's condition much more effectively.
she doesn't have the perspective to understand that
because she's still a kid.
you can't put a decision like this in her hands. if the surgery works,
what will her quality of life be? well, it's hard to know.
she'll be limited in her activities.
you'll need to keep her home mostly.
but with medications, we can sustain her heart.
she'll be alive. for how long?
I want to take her home.
Hi.
okay.
wait. you're the one from the scrub room.
I didn't realize 'cause of the hair.
I had this image of it in my head,
you know, under the cap, and... oh, you didn't recognize me.
okay.
but red. red is good. red becomes you.
thank you.
look, I'm sorry.
I am-- I am having a day.
I-I got some bad news,
and then I've got this patient
another doctor has convinced her parents to let her die,
which I think--I know-- is the wrong decision.
anyway, it's a--whew-- a day.
you ever do that? you ever worry over a patient?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm worrying over this pregnant woman right now.
hmm.
um, charlotte king.
is that your name?
Oh, no, no.
no, she's, um, the chief of staff here.
right. I knew that. i...
you should talk to her.
uh, if you believe your patient should live,
then you should fight for it.
and charlotte--I mean, well, she's charlotte,
but she-- she'll help you fight. thank you.
no problem.
well, I should, um, um, go...
Oh. see charlotte.
right, of course.
if you see the man who assaulted you,
please identify him by stating aloud his reference number.
take as much time as you need.
5
you've indicated suspect number 5.
are you sure that's the man who attacked you?
Yes, I'm sure. 5.
all right, miss avery. thank you for your cooperation.
you did it, jill.
the face...
s-seeing it again, it's
it's okay. he can't hurt you anymore. I thought it would be good.
I-I thought it would help me remember what he did to me.
but it... it's just...
I'm scared. I'm really scared.
I can't believe it's coming out.
I'm gonna get to go in the water for the first time ever, ever.
Dr. freedman, can I see you for a sec?
what's going on?
just give us a second.
catheter is not coming out today.
what? dr. barnes approached me.
he feels he can save annie's life
and that you're letting a minor make a decision
about refusing treatment. the family and I concur on this.
what are you doing?
he has a valid claim. he's going for a court order.
why are you talking to me like that?
like what? like I'm some stranger.
I could've let him sandbag you. I didn't.
I'm giving you a heads-up.
okay, still like a stranger, charlotte, and you know me.
if I didn't think it was right. come on.
I'm just doing my job. that doesn't make it right.
there was definitely flirting. with the surgeon?
Uh-huh. cute surgeon.
cute surgeon.
it felt... good to feel like me again.
Hey, uh, can I steal some of those colored paper clips?
on your desk? for an art project that betsey's doing?
she's in a trance.
Oh, resort porn.
Yes. look, you can
you can watch whales breach, just right from your palapa.
Ooh. when are you going?
Oh, no, no, this isn't for me.
this is for sam and, uh... sonya.
you're planning a trip
for your ex-husband and his new girlfriend.
you realize how weird that sounds?
Yeah, of course I do.
it's ju--look at this place.
I mean, somebody should be enjoying it.
without the surgery, annie dies.
without the surgery, annie has a life,
at least for a little while. there are a number of precedents
that deal with the denial of medical treatment to children,
but they primarily involve
the religious convictions of the parents.
this isn't a religious thi, judge.
it's about giving our little girl
what she really wants.
look, this is as painful a decision as anyone can face.
I understand why the bishops don't want to make it.
but by giving in to what their child wants... and she is a child.
they are abdicating their parental responsibilities.
do I get a say here? I'm sorry, annie, but you don't.
but it's my life.
Yes, but legally, your parents are responsible
for making decisions about your medical care.
and you should know that state law prohibits y
from acting in any way that endangers annie's health.
you're going to force them to make annie undergo the surgery?
that catheter stays in, and the surgery is scheduled
for the first available date. that's not fair.
it's not fair.
Hey, stranger.
Hey.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Yeah, I lightened my surgical schedule.
I had some personal stuff.
finishing or starting?
starting? you. me, too.
I missed you. I shouldn't say that.
but I did...
miss you.
why... shouldn't you say that?
I just, um...
I don't know.
um, I-I should go, uh, back in there
before the baby comes out without me
and... I get sued.
okay.
okay.
still nothing. only his face.
I can't remember anything else.
how am I supposed to testify against him
if I can't remember anything about what happened?
well, the trial is a month away, jill.
you have time. you'll remember. and then what?
I can see what he did to me again and again?
because right now, all I see is his face,
and I see it everywhere
at the store, on the boy who packs my groceries,
at the gym, every guy in t corridor.
every time I go anywhere,
I see him.
and at night, in my dreams-- we can stop.
we can work on helping you cope with where you are today.
no. I want to put him away.
I need this fear to go away.
okay, I'm gonna insert the needle now.
you might feel a slight pinch. wait, wait, before you do it,
I just need for you to talk to me about anything,
just to get my mind off this.
okay, uh, let's see. we can talk about...
you know, you said you weren't having sex.
why not? you're beautiful, successful...
Yeah, well...
I'm kind of in between guys right now.
anybody you got your eye on?
there is... this one guy.
cute? very.
details.
I'm on bed rest and being denied sex.
I need some details. well... he's a good guy.
I mean, I don't ow him that well or athing,
but you can just tell, you know?
he's a good guy, and I need a good guy.
any dates? I don't know, I don't know.
I mean, he's...
it's like he wants to ask me out,
but I don't know.
it's like there's something black or...
well, go after him.
get yours.
and then tell me all about it. okay.
if something happens, you will be the first to know.
I hear the waves are 2 to 4 feet,
great shape.
one of the guys in the office surfs.
said it was great out there today.
maybe. I don't know.
can't see it from here.
I know. I'm sorry.
when I thought that one day,
I could be out there doing it myself,
it was fun to think about.
but now... come on, annie.
we both know the truth.
I'm gonna die in this hospital.
you signed off on the injunction.
now you're telling me you just want me to let her die?
I was doing my job. I was llowing the law.
But? maybe cooper's right.
keeping her alive isn't the same as saving her life.
look, I am sorry annie can't go to school or go surfing,
but is the chance to do that for a month or two,
is that worth giving up the chance at living past 13?
she's got nothing left in her, noah,
not even the will to fight you.
so maybe you should ask yourself,
who are you doing this for?
she still hasn't done the amnio.
maybe you should just do that charm thing you people do.
you're charming.
look, I'm thinking about it, okay?
in psyological cires, we call that a stall.
uh, hey, jill had a very tough session today.
I was wondering if you could do something to help her relax.
Hey, jill.
Jill.
don't touch me!
Jill, it's me. it's pete.
focus on me. look at me. it's pete.
okay. okay?
okay, take a deep breath. you're here. you're okay.
she's resting. Thanks.
violet, you have to stop. She's traumatized.
by the attack. She-she's afraid that if she doesn't finish what she started,
then this thing will keep haunting her. So I'm-I'm gonna support her in that.
Jill is a wreck. She's falling apart. She was happy.
she had a life. He came in and-and took a piece of it away
her contentment, her security. And until she sees this guy
locked up and paying for what he did, she's not gonna move past it.
I hope you're right.
Hey,
you're here late.
Yeah, well... You know, babies don't tell time.
besides, you're, uh, you're here, too.
do you think we push?
as, um, doctors, do you think we push too hard?
I don't know, I mean... well, I have this patient now.
she's pregnant and just... just trying to get her through it.
so she can have a healthy baby, I push,
you know, for patients like her, because she needs me to.
what about when they don't need you to?
are you okay?
I think I've been pushing too hard.
I don't know. Just...
just, um,
just sit here with me?
okay.
do you realize that we don't even know each other's names?
you're right.
I'm Addison Montgomery.
I have to, uh, I have to go. I have a patient.
nice to meet you.
Hey, uh, Betsey's sick. Her school just called. Uh, do you mind if I duck out for, like, an hour?
Heather can't get her. Uh, no, that's fine. Go ahead.
what are you doing? Doesn't this trip look perfect?
for who? You do see what you're doing, right?
Yes, I am helping. You're avoiding.
okay, Archer... broke your heart.
and now you're throwing yourself into Sam's life. So you don't have to pick up and start yours.
don't take this the wrong way, but when was the last time you went on a date?
Oh, come on. Maybe if you... spent all this time and effort
you spending on Sam and Sonya on yourself...
it might be more rewarding.
you're gonna force another procedure on her, right?
I won't push the surgery anymore.
if she doesn't want it, I won't push. What about the judge?
I told him I reevaluated my position.
I just wanted to help her.
so once it's out?
it's not easy to get back in.
if Annie were to have a problem? We might not be able to get medication into her fast enough.
you do understand? This is it.
you sure, Annie? I'm sure.
it's all right, mom. I promise, it's all right.
everything's gonna be okay. You'll see.
I'm gonna see the ocean. You're gonna see the ocean.
one month later...
good news, Morgan. Amnio was normal. There are no genetic abnormalities.
the baby is perfectly healthy.
thank god! Yay! I can't wait to tell my husband.
he should be here any minute. Oh, there he is.
Hi, honey. Oh, uh, this is the wonderful doctor.
I've been telling you so much about--Addison Montgomery.
nice to meet you, Dr. Montgomery. Nice to meet you.
you're gonna do fine.
I don't think I can do this.
I know that you're scared, but I also know that this is something you want to do.
what if I can't? Jill...
look at him. Look at him.
tell me what he did to you.
I heard his voice... telling me not to turn around and...
no, I-I can't. Keep breathing, just like we worked on.
he had a gun. He grabbed me... and the next thing I knew, I felt a blow
across my face. And then he hit me with the gun over
and over and over, until my head slammed into the pavement.
that's right. That's right. That's what he did to you. Now why are you here, Jill?
that man robbed me. He didn't just steal my car and my money.
he stole my sense of security. He stole my ability to sleep at night.
he stole my sense of self-control.
so I came here today...
to get them back.
I'd say you're ready.
Hey. Hey. You should've seen the smile on her face.
when she got on that board.
it's her birthday,
and it just keeps creeping up on me...
that it'll be her last.
it's a good one.
it's what she wanted. She's living.
I should've trusted you to know what Jill could handle,
to know that she'd remember when she was ready. Thank you.
you wanted to see me? Yes, uh, both of you.
wait, wait. Did... did you...
no. No. I didn't.
right now, in my mind, the baby is... is the bug.
and, uh, I've gotten used to the bug. I'm actually...
liking the bug.
and I--I'm afraid if I start seeing it with a Pete head
or a Sheldon head or-- I know myself, and I know that I-I'm not ready to do this.
what about us? If you want to know anything, ask.
if you want to be included, come
both of you, or neither of you.
I understand if you want to walk away, and I'm sorry.
but I know that this is the best way to do it.
for you.
you're alone here.
you have...Cooper and baby.
but you're all alone.
and you don't have to be.
cat got your tongue?
I do not understand you.
what, Cooper? Annie Bishop.
I just bumped to you you went to Noah behind my back.
why didn't you tell me you helped him change his mind?
Charlotte, you did a good thing, a thing that makes me love you even more.
why... I don't need you to love me even more.
I slept with Archer, and you forgive me. You are good.
you're the good one, you do good things. You and...
it makes me sick. You lovin' me, it makes me literally sick to my stomach.
I slept with somebody else. I screwed Archer's brains out.
and you forgive it?
who does that? So, see, you're the good one.
and I'm the bad one. And I don't want credit for saving a little girl's life. I don't want it.
you need to forgive yourself. Damn it, stop loving me.
you need to forgive yourself. Just stop loving me!
no, no, I will not stop loving you. No.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Hi. Look at this, Sonya and I got to make our own private label.
Oh, well, now that's what I call a vacation. Thanks.
so what do you think I should do next with Sonya?
all right? What's the , uh, what's the plan?
uh. you--you know, there is no plan. Yeah, travel agency's closed.
I'm finished. What? You were helping me out. It was fun.
uh, yeah, that's the problem.
you shouldn't be having fun with me. You should be having fun with her.
and, uh, I... should be having some fun of my own.
Annie's 13.
good job.
the jury found him guilty.
very good job.
will you talk to the bug?
I thought you hated that.
just talk to the bug, Cooper.
Hello, bug. Hello. This is your uncle Cooper speaking, and I look forward to seeing you.
in a couple of months.
Hey, ready to go? I got us a 7: 30 reservation...
what's wrong?
you don't call out your ex-wife's name out of habit, not if it's working...
not if it's right.
well, do you... do you want to be with her?
no. No. What she and I had...
a best friend. And you and I...
we're never gonna get there. I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
this is a mistake. Just... be here.
all right. but still, it is a mistake.
I'll be over there.
I wasn't going to come. But you did.
thank you. What do you want, Noah?
Oh, I just, um, I just wanted to say...
I just wanted to tell you that the first time we talked,
I was just a flattered married guy.
and then the second time, I was-I was playing with fire.
and then...
I got attached.
I got attached in a way I didn't expect.
I didn't mean to, I didn't plan...
I have been where you are...
one step away from doing something... really stupid.
I've done... really stupid.
don't take the step.
what if I want to take the step?
what if the step is all I can think about?
she's my patient. You think I don't know that?
finishing or starting?
finishing.
morning. -Good morning.
Oh, hospital rounds? -no.
house call.
since when do you make house calls?
who are you going to see?
a patient.
who's home on bed rest.
Oh, come on. It's-- nai, it's easier for me to go see morgan gellman at home than it is for her to come in here.
the less that she moves, the better chance she has of keeping the baby.
there is nothing going on with me and the husband, okay?
this is a professional visit...
for serious medicareasons.
well, as long as it's a professional visit for serious medical reasons.
I'm responsible for saving that baby's life, nai.
I'm a lifesaver.
I'm a doctor.
she seems okay now.
she paged me on my way in, uh, said she'd already called you.
Oh, yeah.
I'm glad that, um, that--that she called.
Yeah, well, we're trng to be careful.
this is a beautiful home.
Thanks.
morgan decorated it herself.
ll, her taste is...
exquisite.
so...
so we should go on up-- uh, she would be up-- yeah, and see morgan.
up there -yeah.
height-- a thrilling 5 feet even. Weight--a perfectly appropriate 84 pounds.
and overall health, as the kids would say, ab fab.
Dr. Cooper, the kids don't say that.
Really? They don't?
well, they should.
um, mom, it's gretchen. She just got her braces off.
can take it?
12
wasn't it, like, a year ago she was carrying around that stuffed unicorn she made everybody pet?
now she's got pierced ears and a cell phone.
well, given what passes for kids' tv, the internet-- what can you do?
uh, speaking of which, I think sarah needs to see a female doctor.
um, are you uncomfortable with me examining sarah, -or is she? -No, it's not that.
it's--I need someone to prescribe her birth control.
please just tell me it isn't happening again.
if I lose another baby, I swear to god-- look, don't jump there.
you always jump there.
that is because I have lost every baby I've ever carried.
honey. -I'm sorry.
you're scared, but there's no reason to be.
right?
her cervix is open. The amniotic sac is protruding.
can you stop it?
with cervical cerclage, yeah.
okay, can you just stop talking doctor to each other and just talk to me?
I'm gonna sew your cervix shut to keep the baby in.
Noah? -I want her to be transported by ambulance.
I'll ride along to monitor.
I'll call ahead. I'll meet you there.
Hey, it'll be fine.
so, I should be scared now, right?
Hey.
Hi.
what, is sam running late?
one of the great things about practicing law, nai, is that court starts late.
Oh, yeah, and, uh, you get to dress up.
you look good.
damned by faint praise.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Handsome. Handsome. Winning.
a little better.
all right, let's do this.
now that's what I like to see in my expert witness, man-- a little fire in the belly.
Yeah, but probably not bits ed dof relicious in the teeth.
let me see.
no, you're good. You're good.
you ready to save a man's life?
Yes, sir.
good luck.
all right, big ben.
how you feelin' this week?
subpar.
the second I walk outside, I start wheezing like a goat.
you taking that milk thistle before every meal?
choking that down helps for a little, but I feel like my allergies are getting worse.
pretty soon, you'rgonna have to put me in a bubble.
we'll make sure it's a cool bubble. Hop up there.
I hate this part.
how are the ladies treating you?
same as last week and the week before that.
hard to find a keeper.
well, it doesn't get any easier at my age.
my mom hasn't dated anyone since she and my dad got divorced.
well, sometimes people need a little time to-- she's ready.
she just doesn't meet guys who are, you know, smart and funny--cool, like you.
Hi. Sorry.
I just wanted to see how things were going in here.
come in, mom. Meet dr. Pete.
Hi. How are you? -Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry. Uh, his dad usually takes him, so I wasn't sure if I should stay in or out you can stay in, bv dr. Pete?
Yeah, as long as you don't mind me sticking needles in his face.
Oh, I don't know. How long are we gonna have to keep them in?
see? She's funny, right?
and pretty. -Ben
she does pilates, like, every day, makes awesome meat loaf-- okay, goof nut. Thank you.
no, it's okay. I like meat loaf.
I don't like how sheldon was looking at me.
he had on that critical face.
like,"oh, you're gonna eat all that?"
don't mind him.
I do mind him. I mind everyone, everyone who thinks that I choose to eat like a walrus, -much less look like one. -What are you gonna do?
babies need to be fed.
it's only temporary.
breast-feeding alone will burn a million calories.
though you're not breast-feeding yet.
thought you were over pete.
I-I am. I am, entirely.
dell, you know what time it is?
around here, we normally consider 9: 00 e the beginning of the workday.
did I ss anything?
that's not the point.
listen, I know that you're having a hard time with betsey gone, so I'm not gonna make an issue of this.
but the next time you're late, -can yojust please call? -Sure.
Hey, can you give me some help?
Addison's gone, and I have a 12 year old who wants birth control.
we need this baby.
not that I think a baby can or should save a marriage.
I'm not stupid.
but right now, this baby is holding us together.
before I got pregnant, noah and i were gonna try things apart.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
the second baby. Lost it at seven months.
Oh, we've been through hell together.
hell is holding a dead baby in your arms. Our marriage...
there were cracks, you know?
and then they got bigger. They got huge.
whatever happened between us, this baby, you have to save it,'cause this baby's our second chance.
Naomi's great.
don't worry.
um, the whole, you know,"kids grow up so fast" thing, I obviously--I get that.
and, uh, I assume you're being clear with sarah that it's too early for sex.
Oh, dr. Freedman, she's already having it.
she has a boyfriend, another eighth grader.
they both have hormones raging, and frankly, I don't trust him to use a condom.
I'm trying to be proactive.
but you're condoning this.
this is gonna happen whether I like it or not.
I'm just trying to keep as much of it as I can on my terms.
the kids are only allowed to have sex in my house when I'm there.
uh, wait. I'm--I'm sorry. What?
would it be better if I force them to sneak around, scrambling for privacy god knows where with no supervision?
wouldn't it be better if you just told them no?
and enforce it how?
it's just me, and I work 50 hours a week.
I can only try to steer her in the right direction, help her avoid getting hurt.
she's 12 years old and she's having sexual intercourse.
she's already being hurt.
all due respect, you are out of line.
mom.
what's wrong? -We're leaving.
thank you.
What'd you say to her?
so you believe dr. Allen's diagnosis and treatment were appropriate under the circumstances?
more than appropriate.
extraordinary.
uh, martin weiser came into the E. R.
with crushing chest pains, hypoxic, barely responsive.
when the patie progressed to full cardiopulmonary arrest, dr. Allen did C. P.R.
and defibrillation, exactly as indicated, uh, exactly as any doctor would do.
so in your expert opinion, dr. Bennett, were there mistakes made here?
even when we do everything right, and I believe dr. Allen did, there are some patients we just can't save.
now that's not malpractice.
that's.
that's just life.
thank you, doctor.
I'm sorry.
uh, dr. Bennett, I am corinne lee.
I'm counsel for mr. Weiser's widow and his son.
every person is unique.
a good doctor needs to know them, "to evaluate them individually, not by the book.
the book can be wrong.
excuse me, but is there a question somewhere here?
are you familiar with that quote, dr. Bennett?
uh, yes, that is a quote from my book.
but doesn't it contradict what you were just saying about mr. Weiser's care?
you quoted textbook cases and standard protocols.
but you weren't there.
you didn't actually see him.
isn't that correct?
well, I stand behind everything I said about dr. Allen's care.
so you didn't mean what you wrote?
I did.
uh, I-I spent a lot of time researching and writing -- does that leave you much time for seeing actual patients?
well, well, I have a very active medical practice.
Yes, um, oceanside wellness group.
there was a measles outbreak there.
did you follow the book on that one? -Objection.
Argumentative.
Dr. Bennett is holding himself up as an expert.
I'm entitled to question him on that claim.
overruled.
so, uh, the measles outbreak.
a child died.
again, argumentative. -Withdrawn.
was the noted cyclist ray daniels a patient under your care?
Yes, he was. -He had a serious heart muscle disorder, but you let him compete in a 100-mile bike race, -and he died as well, didn't he? -I told him not to race.
but you treated him for a sports injury so that he could race.
see, ray--ray was pigheaded. -Pigheaded?
do you always talk about your patients like that?
no, no. -Or only the dead ones?
wait--wait a minute-- this family lost a husband, a father.
he walked in the door and did not get the treatment that he needed.
now it may be okay with you that patients just die.
it's not okay with them.
so let's talk about your nickname...
Dr. Feelgood.
I just spent time with a happy, healthy girl that she has raised.
Yvonne is obviously doing something right. -She's doing a lot of things right.
I don't think that excuses letting her daughter have sex in the room next to hers.
violet, could you back me up here?
well, it's not that simple.
ani me, adolescent sexuality is not something you can just say no to.
you have to address the nuances of a particular situation.
Yeah, so a mother who acknowledges her daughter's desires and tries to channel them safely is...
probably doing the right thing. -Yeah.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Hello, hopscotchers.
the mother is allowing her 12-year-old daughter to have sex in her house.
Cooper, if you're not there, it's--it's really hard to know what's right forer and her daughter.
right,'cause why would a man get a say?
I mean, the mother knows best. That's how the world works.
see?
okay, like with dell, right?
mother does not always know best.
Yeah, but it's apples and oranges. -No, it is not.
and how can you, as the mother of a little girl, how--how can you not have a problem with what yvonne is doing here?
well, with maya, this-- I mean, zero chance of happening 'cause I would kill her.
but I-I am talking about yvonne's right as a parent to decide what is best for her child.
fine, but motherhood is not a trump card.
wrong is wrong. -Parents get to decide that, cooper.
Yes. -Not doctors.
I-I just hope that when betsey's 12, there's someone like cooper there to say that it's not okay to be sleeping around, no matter what the mother thinks.
Hey, I got brody from anesthesia to come in for morgan.
I booked the O. R.For 4: 00.
okay, well, um, what about the 26 weeks?
is that okay?
uh, it's late. I'm not gonna lie to you.
but it's the best choice.
she loves you, you know?
I know. -She needs you.
I know.
see you tomorrow. It was really nice to meet you.
thank you so much, really. -See you tomorrow, okay?
how can you even think about sleeping with a patient's mother?
what?
that flirty smile, leading to unnecessary but...
come on. -Gentle physical contact.
you know what, violet?
you have no right to comment on my love life.
you don't. -It's an ethical issue.
what? I'm treating her son, not her.
you are taking advantage of a young, -vulnerable mother who can't help but respond... -oh, please.
to someone in a position of authority.
you think that's the only reason she might be interested in me?
ethically speaking-- wrong person to talk to right now.
problem?
never mind. What's your question?
dating a patient's mother-- that's not a problem, right?
violet thinks it's a problem.
I don't know, pete.
I'm about to operate on noah's wife.
and I like her.
I really like her.
and their marriage is on the rocks, and the only thing holding it together is this baby, and I'm supposed to save it.
well, you'll save the baby.
that's what you do.
of course I'm gonna save the baby.
that's not the issue.
it's...
I don't know.
Addison, their marriage, uh, it's--it's not in your hands.
what if it is?
then it's already gone south.
I'm not a cheater, pete.
I'm not.
I mean...
maybe that one time I did, but not now.
I'm--it's not who I am.
I am not a cheater.
I know.
then why do I feel like I am?
what happened?
he just lost it on the stand, nai.
the other side came after him-- the practice, his credibility-- and he just...
he just let her shred him up there.
it was that bad?
I know that I was the one that talked him into doing this, but I just...
thought...
he's sam.
all that experience in front of the camera...
he's a doctor.
he's not a spokesperson.
if there's any chance of turning this around,
I need to put sam back up there on that stand.
Buonly if he can do it.
what happened?
shortness of breath with pleuritic chest pain.
SATs are dropping, d-dimer's positive.
probably threw a P. E. -is the...the baby okay?
there's no signs of fetal distress, morgan.
v-fib. She's coding.
get the crash cart, stat!
let's go.
give me the bag. -Get the cart over here.
give me the bag.
get ready charge.
I'll do it. I'm--I'm gonna do it.
Noah-- no, look. She's my wife.
I'll do it.
charge to 200.
charge okay. Clear.
charge to 300.
charge -all right.
clear.
I got a pulse.
okay, pressure's coming up.
baby's heartbeat is normal.
start heon lidocaine. Call I. C.U.
and tell 'em we need a room, now.
um, bolus 75 milligrams, then start a 2-milligrams- per-minute drip.
she almost died. -But she didn't. She didn't.
there's no way you could've known about the P. E.
I'm a heart surgeon. I should've. -There's no way
I mean, I live with her.
I wasn't paying any attention. -This isn't your fault.
Noah, this isn't your fault. -I wasn't paying any attention to her.
it is. It is my fault.
I don't see her anymore. I don't look at her...
but-- I don't think about her, not like I should.
I mean, I care about the baby, but I don't-- yes, but-- I don't think about her.
I don't see her anymore. -But you just saved her life, noah.
would you stop trying to make me feel better?!
I don't think about her.
all I think about is you.
all I think about is you, and she could've died.
she could've died.
feeling better?
I looked like an idiot in there, nai.
I'm a good doctor.
I'm a great doctor.
Yes, you are a great doctor.
you are not a professional witness.
that's no excuse.
Sam, I have seen you convince an entire auditorium of people to do what you wrote in your book.
now I know that you can convince 12 people that you're not a blithering idiot.
he wants to put you back on the stand.
Really?
Yeah.
that means I gotta go back over all the medicine from that case and memorize it.
that way, no matter what I'm asked,
I'll be able to bring it back to what happened, what matters.
I will not be thrown.
Sarah, luv this pic of you. Bo thinks u r so hot naked.
ayin I can't help it.
all I want to do is eat and sleep and bark.
I barked at pete this morning.
but, you know, he deserved it he wants to date a patient's mother.
what?
a message from some kid about the nad pictures of my 12-year-old patient that are now apparently floating around.
you still think mother knows best?
who are u calling?
I'm calling D. C.F. S.
about sarah?
no, cooper. You cannot do that.
somebody needs to protect this girl.
you cannot call family services.
I just got her blood work back.
Sarah's pregnant.
Hey.
maybe you should've dropped me as a patient.
I seem to be trouble.
you're doing fine now.
Noah told me.
he was, uh, here...
till--till I woke up.
did you talk to him?
what?
he wouldn't look at me.
I mean, he was here with me, but he wasn't with me.
he wouldn't look at me.
did you talk to him?
I think he just got a little-- a little scared.
we should be scared together.
Oh, he should be able to look at me.
why don't you try to get some rest?
we'll do the procedure tomorrow.
can I help you?
m I'waiting for dr. Parker.
Dell?
doctor-- dr. Parker, yeah.
of course you are.
do you think he'll be long?
I don't think so. -No, dr. Parker, he's just finishing up some very important medical stuff.
cool.
dell parker, american hero.
she's waiting for dr. Parker.
we need to talk about dell.
he's late, he's playing doctor.
I gotta go.
so, uh, I was going back over the records, uh, trying to anticipate every question that they might ask me, and, uh, well, two years ago, your patient had a hernia patched up.
it was just a quick, 20-minute procedure.
they gave him morphine for--for the pain.
he wasn't my patient two years ago.
I know, but morphine was overkill.
they would've just given him a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory unless...
he was allergic to aspirin.
now the aspirin sensitivity would've-- would've been flagged, uh, on the chart.
but it's not.
right. I know it's not, because...
see? The page is blank.
now every other page is filled out meticulously.
this page is blank. You...
you changed out the page.
see, that would explain why you couldn't revive him.
you gave him aspirin, and he was...
it wasn't just a heart attack.
I had a barely responsive patient with severe chest pains.
I was racing against the clock.
by the time that file came down, I was losing him.
I couldn't afford to wade through his whole medical history.
no doctor would've had time.
probably not, but y-you could've testified to that.
I would've backed you up.
and I would've lost everything.
juries don't care that we see aspirin sensitivity in what, one out of every thousand patients?
they'd just hear the word "mistake," and nothing else would get by.
does duncan known about this?
no.
he wouldn't have been able to put me on the stand to say something he knows isn't true.
Dr. Bennet.
please.
you want me to lie for you?
I want you to speak fully and honestly about how I handled that code.
now I had to make a series of judgment calls, and I did what any good doctor would've, what you would've.
you want me to lie.
they're not gonna ask about that file.
I'm good at what I do. I save lives.
please.
I'm coming.
I was supposed to meet cooper. -Cooper's not back yet.
you gonna tell me the problem?
you were right.
I'm jealous.
I mean, I'm not jealous like I want to be with him.
I'm just jealous like...
I don't want to see him with anybody else, which is crazy and unfair.
crazy, but it makes sense...
given what you two had...
may have.
I know, but it's pete.
it's sleep-with-the-temp pete, sleep-with-anything pete,
I'm-bad-in-a-relationship pete.
good people do bad things.
bad people do bad things.
I would kill for some whipped cream.
people change.
when they're with the right person, they can change.
I slept with archer montgomery...
when things were rocky with cooper and me.
W-w--archer?
coop knows.
he forgave me.
well, of course he's gonna forgive you.
he has a neurotic desire to rescue, which makes him susceptible to hostile dependency.
I confided in you to make a point about pete.
Yeah, and maybe you want a little catharsis.
you want a professional tell you that it's okay.
well, it's not okay.
you think if I needed absolution, which I don't,
I'd seek out someone who slept with two men one floor apart, and didn't have the courage or the decency to figure out let alone tell them whose baby she's carrying?
everybody's having sex. Everybody.
governors, they get call girls, girls sell their virginity on the internet, not a celebrity in this town goes out with their underpants on, but it's my 12-year-old patient who pays the price. How's that fair?
I'm going to bed.
I'm keeping this.
you savoring the end of a good day or drowning out a bad one?
the doctor that I'm the expert witness for did something wrong.
so you have to testify to that.
the thing that he did, the other side doesn't know about.
that's the irony.
they know that there's something wrong, but they're wrong about what it is.
and if they don't ask me anything, and I don't say anything-- then...
they'll never know.
Yeah, I...
I know how you feel.
want to talk about it? -No.
Yes. No. I...
you can't tell nai.
okay. -And you can't say anything back...
or make any faces.
okay. -Okay?
o-- okay.
the husband of one of my patients, there's something...
happening between me and him.
and I don't know if I'm strong enough to stop it or...
if I want to stop it.
I...
I don't know.
what?
I am not saying anything or making a face.
thank you.
having a conscience is brutal.
my boobs hurt.
did you get sore?
I mean, like, really, really sore?
Yeah, well, I-- you know, and I'm exhausted, and then I lay down, and it's nothing.
and food tastes different, too.
do you know what I had for breakfast this morning?
I had tuna fish and whipped cream.
no, it tasted amazing.
I don't know.
maybe I'm just looking at things differently right now.
there's just amazing...
joy to this thing that's just...amazing.
but then the baby's head starts grinding against my pelvis and...
Oh, what?
once you pop this baby out, it's all gonna be worth it.
look at you, all smiley.
what?
if you had sex last night, -I do not want to hear about it. -Oh, no, no, no.
no sex, no.
sexy dream.
the suit guy?
Oh, nice.
Yeah, well, nice in a dream, but, you know, he's one of sam's oldest friends.
he's working with sam.
it just--it might be a little too close to home.
well, you and sam work together. Your lives are intertwined.
how are you ever gonna meet anyone who's not too close to home?
how are any of us everonna meet anyone who's not too close to home?
I think we should amputate. -Okay.
all right.
you ready for another round?
sure, but can I use the bathroom first?
what? You just went.
Hey, the guy's got needles in here, and I have a nervous bladder.
I don't know what's gotten into him.
well, I do have needles in here.
I...
I know why ben likes you.
but the real test...
the real test is, um...
do you have anything for stress and exhaustion?
how about...
a nice long dinner at casa del mar?
is that a prescription or an invitation?
Y--both.
she's pregnant?
Oh, my god.
you're gonna be okay, sarah.
uh, how soon-- how soon can we, uh, take care oft?
mom-- I'm so sorry.
I should've never let this happen, but I will fix it.
L-let's--let's all just take a breath, okay?
this is new and it's hard and it's very scary.
but there are a lot of factors to consider before we...
get to that point, okay?
you okay?
Hey, sarah, I know this is scary, and you shouldn't have to go through this at your age.
okay, we've heard your point of view, and of course she shouldn't have to go through it.
she's having an abortion.
okay, this is where you put your foot down?
she's 12 years old.
and where did you think it was leading? -Cooper.
excuse me - thank you.
I want to keep the baby.
Hey, violet, I asked lisa out. Ben's mom.
um, it's not wrong, I'm doing it openly, and I don't want to fight about it, so I'm telling you.
I understand.
I'm trying to do the right thing here, whatever that is, and, but I also need to have a life.
you should.
Thanks.
you need to back off in there. -Okay, how...
how are we s-- forget it.
good morning. -Yeah, I went out pretty hard last night.
I felt like crap this morning, so...
what, what, so you just decided to sleep in?
no, actually, I was up early, but I had bed spins.
then I saw it was 3 to 5 and glassy.
figured I'd get an hour in the water before I headed here.
dell, this is not you.
maybe this is me no oneCan't have any fun.
but you have responsibilities here, dell-- I'm sick of trying to work so hard to do the right thing all the time.
work full-time, get licensed, act like an adult--who cares?
who cares?
okay, your sats look good.
I'll have the nurse come and prep you for the cerclage, and I will meet you in the O. R.
have you see noah?
he's not here yet?
he hasn't come or answered the phone.
we, I'll, um, I'll page him. Maybe he's in surgery.
I already tried. He's not.
I can't do this without him.
we can't wait on this. We--we have to do it now.
then find him for me.
please.
just find him.
what was so important I had to run up here in the middle of my day?
I want to throttle someone.
you gotta be kidding. -I'm s--I'm serious.
I'm serious. I just had to
I had to walk out of a consult so I didt explode at the mother of my 12-year-old patient-- my pregnant 12-year-old patient
whose mother has decided all of a sudden she's interested in parenting again.
Oh, I should've called D. C.F. S.
coop, isn't this what you wanted, for her to step up and parent?
parent?
Yes.
she is dictating an abortion to a 12 year old.
is she wrong?
probably not.
I see what it is doing to that girl and what it's going to be doing to her...
and I find that hard...
to forgive.
you forgave me...
for worse.
Dr. Wilder.
what happened? -I don't know.
he called me from a friend's house, said he was having trouble swallowing, and then in the car, he said he was-- he was feeling dizzy.
maybe I should've brought him to the hospital.
no, no, that's okay.
we'll take care of him right here.
he never had a problem with food.
it's only been environmental.
problems can start at any age, and ben's a highly allergic kid.
Something's...wrong.
okay, ben, you're having an acute allergic attack, but you're gonna be okay.
I'll take care of you, all right?
I just have to grab a couple of things.
buddy, listen to me. He's gonna get some medicine.
you're gonna feel better in just a little bit, okay?
I'm right here. I'm right here. It's gonna be okay.
you're gonna feel better in just a couple more seconds.
I'm gonna give you some adrenaline.
it's gonna open up your airway.
is your throat opening?
you getting some air?
it's working.
thank you. -You're gonna be okay.
thank you.
so based on your years of experience, the dozens of cardiac patients that you have personally attended to, inour professional opinion, dr. Bennett, did dr. Allen do everything that he reasonably could do to save the patient?
Yes, he did.
is there anything that you would've done differently?
Dr. Bennett?
uh, given what dr. Allen knew at the time, no.
no further questions.
Recross.
what do you mean,"given what dr. Allen knew at the time"?
objection.
calls for speculation.
overruled.
you may answer the question.
uh, dr. Allen was working so fast, and he was under so much pressure...
that he didn't stop to look at the patient's full medical history.
so he was not aware that martin weiser had an aspirin allergy.
that's not in any of our discovery.
that's because, uh, dr. Allen swapped out one of the pages, uh, from the file.
he lied?
Yes.
you should've come to me and told me -that would've put you in an impossible position.
and you thought this would be better?
you wanted me here as an expert, a doctor.
that means I'm asking people to trust me with their lives every day.
now part of that trust means telling the truth.
even when it's hard, I have ttell the truth.
you should've come to me.
you want to tell me what you're doing?
I can't look at her.
she'll see it in my eyes. -It's time for her surgery, noah.
look, I'm cheating on her.
no-- in my soul, I am-- I'm cheating on her.
she deserves more.
what kind of man-- no, no, no, listen to me.
your wife is about to have a procedure that scares the hell out of her.
she's upstairs, she's alone and she needs you.
what kind of man are you?
you're the kind of man who puts his own feelings aside, as hard as that might be, and goes in that O. R.
and holds his wife's hand.
that's the kind of man you are.
well, I screwed up.
I had my chae to be a parent, and I screwed up.
now she doesn't care what I have to say.
you know what she told me?
that she's the baby's mother, so she gets to decide.
she's right.
you can't force her to have an abortion.
but you're still her mother.
and if she's gonna be a parent, she's gonna need you even more.
Sarah is still a child, and she as a lot to learn from you.
you think she'll listen to me?
I think you have to keep trying.
I didn't think you were coming.
I'm here.
tell me it's gonna be okay.
it is.
everything's gonna be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
how'd the testimony go?
Oh, uh, it was complicated.
Oh, complicated good, or complicated bad?
you want to come down by the water with me, have a drink, I'll tell you?
Oh, um, you know, I,um, I,uh, I have plans, so-- oh, okay.
I'm going out with duncan.
Really? Okay.
so tomorrow?
sure.
sure.
how you doing? -You look fantaic.
I do? -Yes, you do.
thank you.
what do you think you're doing?
spare me the sermo okay?
Naomi's already preached to me twice.
this isn't a sermon, and I'm not preaching.
I'm telling you to cut the crap.
now I know that heather took betsey, and you're hurting, but that does not give you carte blanche to blow this job off or treat this place with any disrespect.
this is a top-notch private medical practice, and everybody around here is gonna act like it at a times, no matter what's going on in their private lives, including you.
Pete is on a date with a patient's mother, which follows him sleeping with a coworker or three.
violet got knocked up, probably in this exact same office, the same office where you and naomi-- you better stop it right there.
this ends here.
you're gonna take your ass home, get some sleep, come back first thing tomorrow morning with a better attitude you've got a family who needs you here, dell.
gimmie pizza! Gimmie pizza!
gimmie pizza! Gimmie pizza!
all right, margaritas, chimichangas-- you ready, amiga?
what?
Violet's crazy and hostile and needy, and she drives me up a wall...
but she needs you, coop.
go home.
I don't know...why I'm here.
I just...I couldn't... .
what are you peoe doing in my home?
I told you. It's a surprise.
it's a surprise for sam.
you know about this?
sadly, I do.
if it's a surprise for sam, then why aren't you at sam's house?
put that down.
cause that would totally ruin the surprise, wouldn't it?
wait, what are you doing?
Cooper thinks sam's in a rut.
what-- well, I am not in a rut, okay? And, in fact, I have plans.
you have plans? With who?
with naomi.
you invited naomi here? - Hey...
no, see, actually, no, that's no good.
well, it's good for me.
it's good for naomi. Naomi's my friend.
you people, I barely know.
the thing is, naomi kind of steps on the surprise.
what kind of surprise is this?
one named ginger.
what? - What?
I'm outta here.
Oh, she's about to ring the doorbell.
five minutes.
Ah, okay.
now we're getting somewhere.
they can't stop us, buddy. Right?
Cooper, how do you even know how to find a stripper?
ginger is not a stripper.
she's an entertainer.
what does that even mean?
I'm still trying to figure it out.
Sam is not like you, cooper.
he's not interested in- - I think sam is.
Sam and a stripper, who kn?
Hey, it's just getting good. Could you...
a stripper?
Oh, you like that?
you have something.
Thanks. You're sweet, too.
no, you got something right here. - Huh?
let me just get a closer look.
uh, yeah.
Hey, man.
what were yothinking?
it's a long, sad story.
and I'm gonna set them up with an x-ray.
you're not fooling anybody, cooper.
who's up first?
uh, dave walker called this morning, uh, complaining of headache and nausea.
I heard his wife left him.
Yeah, and he's drinking again.
got his son and his mother living with him.
so I'm gonna go check him out.
you do house calls, too? - We.
we all do house calls.
what? - Nothing.
I got the o'briens bringing their baby in again.
9-month-old girl, she's been sick since birth.
O'brien--is that the dad who's
Yeah, he's totally disconnected from this baby.
it drives me crazy.
I tried to get him in to see you. No go.
well, let me know if I can be of any help on the case.
you want to help me?
what?
anything else?
uh, yeah, I have two cases next week- - nobody? Super.
all right, and I'll be leaving.
does it even occur to you to think of naomi's feelings?
so wait, do they know?
does naomi know?
back to the triple-jointed thing.
it--it--it looks like it hurts, but in the most awesomest way.
this--this-- look, did she do this?
Hey. Are you mad at me?
because it kind of seemed like you were mad at me in the meeting.
I'm just looking out for naomi.
Hi, amber. see you next week, thomas.
Addison is mad at me because cooper hired a stripper.
I'm ignoring the stripper.
today is a day for ignoring things.
I am all business today.
who's my next patient?
this guy wants to talk to you.
sign, please.
Oh, no.
that's a nice bike.
no? Okay.
looks like emily's gained some weight. That's good.
she been sleeping?
better, don't you think?
no, I don't, actually.
you know, we said it was gonna be a long haul when she was born with these symptoms. So...
I just feel like, when is she gonna catch a break, you know?
well... here you go.
come here, emily. Look at that guy.
who's that guy?
you know, just to be safe, I am gonna run a couple more blood tests.
Oh, she hates needles.
if it was optional, I wouldn't do it, but it's not, so...
okay?
did you know you have an office here?
here, it's--it's right next door.
I am asking because I am curious, not because I care.
what's her name?
who's name?
the girl. The girl, sam.
her name is ginger?
Hey, I did not name her.
I didn't hold her up to the moon and dothe whole kunta kinte thing.
this isn't "roots.
Oh, you funny-- you funny man.
her name is ginger.
did you sleep with ginger?
and you're asking because you're curious?
Yeah. - Yes.
Samuel! - No, I didn't.
I just wanted to see what "curiosity" looked like.
it's an awful lot like jealousy.
I am not jealous.
Oh, yes, you are.
if I want to see a stripper, I'm gonna see a stripper.
shoot.
I'm grown.
tryin' to tell me... come on, dave.
I know you didn't go to work.
Dave probably gets to see strippers. Probably got one in there right now.
I know you didn't make me come out here for nothin', dave.
come on.
Dave, open the door.
ms. Walk, open up the door.
all right.
how long has he been like this? - I-I don't know.
I just came downstairs and he was--I-I don't know.
all right. Ms. Walker, how long's he been like this?
grandma?
Yes, this is dr. Sam bennett.
I need an ambulance immediately.
Dave, what happened in there?
Oh, I don't know. I...
had breakfast, getting ready for work, next thing I know, I'm hugging the toilet.
what's wrong with him?
well, once we get to the hospital, we'll figure that out.
but he's coming back?
of course I am, stevie.
Stevie, I don't want you to be here by yourself.
I'm okay. My--my grandmother's here.
Yeah.
fellas, would you mind, uh, taking the boy and his grandmother with you?
I'm worrieabout leaving her in charge. All right.
do you want to talk about sam'.
well, not sam-- I mean, clearly not- - oh, come on.
will you say it? say it. - It's not
Sam's stripper.
Sam's stripper. Say it.
so what?
so? And sam's single.
I'm single...
so single, and--and single people move on.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I've been looking at this in my office all day.
you bought a bike?
Yeah, it's custom built, it's from italy, and allan is never getting his hands on it, ever.
I don't care if it costs $6, 000.
you bought allan a $6, 000 bike?
I-I ordered it last year. It just arrived today...
on his birthday.
brutal.
why don't you sell it?
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will.
or give it away. Just
great. Exactly.
I'm gonna give it away.
Hey. Hey.
you will not give allan that bike.
I won't?
will you be strong?
Yeah.
strong.
I-I told my teacher there's probably no way you could do it, but
do what?
speak at my midwifery class.
I told my teacher about naomi, and--and she called you "a primal life giver.
I-I think I have something that night, so- - come on.
do it.
might give you a boost.
I don't... I don't need boosting.
I'm fine.
I'll do it.
I love talking to midwiffs.
Yeah, actually I think-- I think we're-- we're good on O. B.S but
Oh, I'm actually a double board certified uh, neonatal surgeon.
one of the best... in the world...
with a specialty in genetics-- D. N.A.
uh, well, yeah, maybe, you know, if, um, if someone drops out.
you can't get more primal and life giving than D. N.A
excuse me.
uh, do you still have time for that consult?
the little girl? - Yeah.
um, please tell I'm reading that wrong.
Cooper asked for a second opinion, but the genetic tests we ran confirm that emily has a serious presentation of something called pelizaeus-merzbacher disease.
how do we cure it?
well, there's medication to treat the symptoms, but there is no cure.
so she's...
not going to get better?
ever?
the drugs can give her five years, maybe more.
what? - Five year--five?
I'm sorry.
I know this is difficult to hear.
and we will do everything that we can.
wait, you said that this was genetic.
so one of us made her sick?
no, you can't think of it like that.
because my sister, she's trying to get pregnant.
I mean, could she have this, too?
we'll have to run some blood tests.
we'll see which mutation you're carrying.
it's important not only for your sister, but also for you, if and when you should decide you want other children.
no. Emily-- emily is all we need.
excuse me. I'm looking for a dave walker.
he came in with vomiting and severe dehydration.
he was released 15 minutes ago.
on whose orders?
you don't release my patient without calling me.
don't lecture me on medical etiquette.
the vitals were normal, we needed the bays, and he wanted to leave.
probably just had some 24-hour bug.
well, it didn't look like a bug.
he was unconscious when I found him.
he saiit was something he ate, but he tested negative for E. Coli, salmonella
that still leaves about a hundred other possibilities, none of which require hospital stays.
he was fine, sam.
besides, grandma said she could handle it.
the same grandma who couldn't call 9-1-1?
that's why you don't release my patients without calling me.
any word back about the little girl?
Yeah, but the test results don't make any sense.
sometimes they can be hard to read. Let me see.
this does not... - no, no.
you see the...
this doesn't make any sense.
which mutation did the parentspass on to emily?
none.
well, how is that possible?
because they're not her parents.
Emily is ours. She's my baby.
uh, there's the chance that this was human error
the hospital nursery wristbands fell off, got mixed up.
there is also the possibility that someone may have done this on purpose.
are--are you accusing us?
I mean, you think that we wanted this?
right now, all you have to do is take care of emily, and we'll find out what happened.
I'm telling you, there is something wrong with this guy.
we tell him his daughter's dying, he's cold as ice.
we tell him he's not the father, he gets defensive right off the bat.
people react to terrible news in different ways.
it's his child. Show some emotion.
where did beth give birth?
St. Ambrose.
Oh, perfect.
Charlotte king's hospital. - I'm going over there.
no, you--you need to stay here and just calm down. We'll go.
fine.
where are those nursery records?
there was no stolen baby reported-- not in this hospital, not while I was chief.
well, then two sets of parents went home with the wrong babies.
I swear, do you all take some kind of perverse pleasure in ruining my life?
Yeah, there are switched babies out there, but this is about us.
this hospital has the best nurses in the city.
neonate spent a fortune on security.
did st. Ambrose institute nap time, or do I still have a staff?
then why don't you show us the records for the other babies that were in the nursery the time that emily was there?
will someone just br-- thank you.
there was only one other african-american girl in the nursery at that time.
who is it?
this hospital spent 124 years building its reputation.
I am not gonna ruin that by chatting with you.
can you just give us the name?
not until I talk to our attorneys.
blood pressure 125 over 84.
that's normal. - Yeah.
I feel a lot better. - Okay.
maybe a little shaky. What--what do you think it was?
still not sure.
just to be safe, why don't you clean the kitchen top to bottom?
it's not the food that got him sick.
ma, please.
Oh, stevie. Close the door, honey.
I'll leave it open. Then the next time dad passes out, no one's got to break a window to get in.
Hey, stevie.
is he okay?
Oh, he's just bullheaded, like his dad.
what are you gonna do?
and your mom?
we're doing real good, doc.
things are good.
so what am I missing?
well, in 90% of these cases, it comes down to history and environment.
Oh, well, the environment's all messed up.
the dad's drinking, grandma's got way more than she can handle, the kid's acting out.
that sounds a lot more serious than a 24-hour flu.
see, that's why I'm worried.
they've got enough to deal with as is.
and if david's got something really serious, I'm not sure how they hold it together.
Hey, coop. - Hey...
I didn't recognize you in...
I didn't recognize you.
tell me that is not the girl from last night.
Cooper's bringing 'em to work now?
Oh, my god. That's it.
he has just crossed the line.
Sam just hugged a stripper.
God, at least with cooper, you know what you have.
okay, now let's all calm down.
Sam is not a dog. He never was.
now there could be a totally innocent explanation for this.
What--what--what, for stripper hugging?
give me one. Give me one.
well...
like she's here to see the real dog.
Oh, would--would you look at him?
he's all... "I'm a doctor. My touch heals.
can I talk to you?
I spoke to our attorneys. - And?
some days I really hate the hippocratic oath.
here.
here's the file on the second african-american baby in the hospital nursery.
you're just giving it to us, just like that?
if you think I'm being nice, read the name.
Oh, god.
what?
and my problem becomes your problem.
Melinda and duncan stinson.
you know them?
I got them pregnanT.
what do you think of your handiwork, naomi?
Oh, she is so cute.
and if you tell me I've got more hormone's to take, I'm gonna scream.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
it's just, uh, we need to run some blood tests on all of you.
what's going on?
so how are you holding up?
I'll be better when we find out who did this?
all your nurses check out?
one moved a few days later, but her record was impeccable.
well, something happened in that nursery.
you don't know that.
that doesn't stop you from tossing the blame my way.
I know that if one of my patients was in this much pain, I would be busting my ass looking for answers.
thank you.
I hadn't gotten my earful of oceanside arrogance today.
look at him.
how is that guy and the guy who hired me a stripper the same person?
he's cooper.
so this other couple...
their baby was born the same night?
that's right.
We're--we're running blood tests on them now.
what if the other blood tests come back positive?
this is the hard part.
acrding to california law...
you would...
say good-bye to emily...
and you would welcome a new child into your lives.
that's--that's ridiculous. Okay?
the blood tests are not gonna come back positive and I don't care what our blood tests said
honey, honey- - no. No.
I know emily is my daughter, okay?
a mother can feel these things.
I don't love that other child.
I couldn't love another baby.
I love emily.
well, why don't we just wait for the results of the blood test and go from there?
Emily's had a hard time, now she has to adjust to a whole new family?
well, the babies are young.
you know, adoptions take place at this age all the time.
the kids are usually fine.
it's the parents I'm worried about.
they're the ones who grieve.
Greg o'brien doesn't seem to be grieving.
what is up with you and this case?
your emotional attachment is huge.
you're one to lecture me about unhealthy emotional attachments.
okay, that was a nice deflection.
but unlike you, I am detaching.
you want to try it?
it's yours.
light.
why didn't allan buy his own bike?
on our third anniversary, you know, we took that trip to italy, and he took me to the town where they made those because even as a child he had--he'd wanted one.
so he saved up his money...
but then his dad split on his mom, so he had to use his savings to pay rent and to keep his mom afloat.
and he never got the bike.
what? What?
take the bike. You love it.
Yeah, I loved it when I thought it was a cool, sexy,"get me laid" bike, not some sad, allan-y "cat's in the cradle" bike.
Hey.
is that stripper still in your office?
entertainer not stripper, and yes.
and she's been in there all day? Why?
we're trying a few different techniques.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure you are.
you know what?
Naomi does not need ginger thrown in her face.
Naomi is a big girl. She can handle it.
she doesn't have to. That's why I'm here.
Pete, is it supposed to feel tingly?
Pete, is it supposed to feel... you know what?
go. Go do
take care of your poor little stripper girl and her "tingly.
entertainer, and why are you so angry at me?
You--I- - cooper's the one that set this
you know, I am trying to take care of my friend.
and cooper is bad, but you're worse.
and you know why? Because you're slippery. Yeah.
you walk around pretending to be all soulful, but you don't take the heat.
you just do whatever you want to do and you evade.
evade, evade, evade.
do you need me to kiss you again?
No!
okay.
you're back.
nurses' schedules...
perinatal testing, personnel files.
What'd you find?
not a damn thing.
I have been through every one of these backwards and forwards.
you're so sure my hospital ruined these people's lives, then help me prove it.
please! Someone hurry!
help me!
please!
Sam! Sam, front.
Hey! Hey! Help!
please, help me! - Yeah, ma'am, it's all right.
Sam! - Stevie, what's going on?
whatever my dad had...
I got it worse.
I got home. Grandma made dad and me some sandwiches, then...pukeville.
Mrs. Walker, what did i tell you about that kitchen?
well, it was just a ndwich.
that could've killed him.
where is your father?
at--at work.
I didn't want to bother him with this.
Mrs. Walker, I understand you mean well for your family, but something you are doing is making them sick.
this is a family matter, doctor.
it doesn't concern you.
Hey, dell, can you hand carry stevie walker's blood to the lab for me?
put a rush on it.
have them screen for ingestible poisons.
Hey. I just got the test back from the stinsons.
the o'brien baby is their baby.
and the stinson baby belongs to the o'briens.
Yep.
how do you tell someone that their baby was switched with another baby?
damn it.
well, that was the hardest thing I've ever done.
you did everything right.
and dad doesn't shed a tear.
how's it going with naomi?
well, you know, so far, so
do you know what you put my wife through, what you put us through?
and now you tell us that this--this other baby who we've never met is sick!
we did everything you asked us to do.
I know how hard you two worked to get pregnant.
let down after let down, the--the miscarriages, the hormones...
you how many shots I had to stick in her?
she could hardly move she was so bruised.
I-I wish there was something I could do.
Yeah, there is something you can do.
you can start by explaining how you-- how you can live with yourself
taking our money and promising us a healthy baby.
Duncan, I never promised you perfection.
I promised you a child.
my retirement, vacation pay-- our future!
we spent it all so we could have our little girl!
Duncan, please.
I want my money back.
I want my damn money back!
your husband...
he has a right to be angry.
so do you.
I could just take sarah and go.
we could just go away.
no one would find us.
except you won'T.
because emily is your daughter.
and she is sick.
and a mother never leaves her child behind.
not a strong mother.
no. No.
this isn't happening.
I'm not gonna do it.
come on, baby.
Hey.
Stevie walker's lab results.
Coprine?
from the mushroom?
ink cap mushrooms contain coprine.
it's like a natural form of antabuse.
when you ingest the mushroom, then if you drink alcohol you get really
really, really sick.
so someone's poisoning stevie?
any luck?
well, I think we know when the switch happened.
we have baby emily'shospital record and baby sarah's hospital records, and then on day two, they switched.
Emily becomes sarah and sarah becomes emily?
what about this nurse, left town?
no, she was in the E. R. Of my hospital, laid out with the flu hooked up to an I. V.All night.
so we're back to square one?
my patient is being poisoned by his own dear, sweet mother.
she's dosing him with ink cap mushrooms.
which means he's drinking-- boom, on the floor.
baby switch. - Poisoning?
for real? Baby
Hi. You are not a member of this practice.
so you have to go ahead and unhear that.
I thought I had a problem.
Yeah, well, maybe we can help you with yours since we're not getting anywhere.
I-I don't know.
I-I gotta stop the mother from hurting her son.
now she's also poisoning her grandson.
but I can't send her to jail, can I?
how could a parent do that to a child?
let me see the visitor's log again.
Yeah.
the first two days, one person was there constantly.
a parent...
did that to a child.
what you're doing is a crime.
you can't go around poisoning people.
no, I only meant it for david.
I didn't know stevie was drinking.
so it's okay to poison your own son?
well, every time he takes a drink, he pays for it.
at's how you teach my david a lesson.
you have to stop doing this, now.
no.
my family, we're weak when it comes to this.
David's not weak.
he's an alcoholic.
and some old world remedy will not guarantee that he'll stop drinking.
now I'm a doctor, and I'm telling you
what? You...
you're like all the other doctors.
Oh, you make him go to a 12-step group, but do you make him stop drinking?
no. So I did.
please.
you can't tell david.
this will work.
as david's doctor, I can't let it happen.
I'm sorry.
then you might as well have me arrested.
because I don't know how long I've got, and my family means everything.
if I don't protect them, who will?
from birth your baby-- your biological baby-- well, it was difficult.
she had a neurological problem.
she did?
your c-section caused severe post-labor pain, so you were sedated for most of the first two days.
you wouldn't have been aware of how serious it was.
but you were, mr. Stinson.
you were in the nursery 24/7.
and then when your daughter was 2 days old, she seized while you were holding her.
what are you saying?
what-- what are you saying? I
she's saying that the next time you were in the nursery alone is when those babies were switched.
you were the only one there.
it would've been easy enough to switch off your baby's security bracelet because she was so small.
no, I'm not gonna stand for this.
if I were that baby's father
Mr. Stinson, people's lives have been altered-- your child's life.
you were supposed to take care of her, and instead you switched her because she was sick.
Mr. Stinson, I-I think this is your opportunity to explain to us
no, no, no, you explain.
you explain!
3 years and--and $250, 000 and all my wife's hopes and dreams...
Oh, my god.
Melinda, th-this other family, they can have more kids, healthy kids.
you see?
wait, this isn't-- I'm not a
Melinda, honey...
how could you give my baby to somebody else?
how could you?
makes it okay for you to steal a child?
adults are there to protect children.
we're supposed to keep them from harm.
you're angry at yourself.
what?
I'm talking about duncan stinson, what he did.
I'm angry about that.
right. Before that, it was greg o'ien.
but it's really about you.
don't...
do the shrink thing, violet.
you can't blame yourself for not being able to make her better, cooper.
she's just a baby.
Dave, we're here because you have a problem with alcohol.
a problem?
no.
maybe I have a glass of wine or a beer-- - dave.
once, twice a week, maybe I drink more than I should.
we need to get you into a treatment program.
Why?
because I like beer?
come on.
I don't need treatment.
sorry.
all right, well, you should know that I figured out why you've been getting sick.
uh, you've developed an allergy...to alcohol.
what? That's not possible.
well, it's rare.
Yeah, it's--it's really rare.
and it probably runs in the family.
so, I mean, you've seen what happens when you drink.
that's gonna happen every single time.
so I...
I have to stop drinking?
Yeah, you do.
that's my diagnosis.
now if you continue to get sick, then I'm going to have to consider that it's something much more serious.
Gloria, you're gonna help dave make sure that never happens, not even once?
Oh, yes, yes.
He--well, he-- he's learned his lesson.
come in.
would you like to sit down?
I think it might be helpful for us to talk about what happened.
your husband...
is not my husband anymore.
that other little girl...
your daughter.
she's so sick that she could die?
Yes.
before she's 5 years old?
Yes.
this is emily.
this is mama.
this is emily.
I don't, um...this is a mistake.
I can't-- I-I thought it would feel like
listen, listen, listen, it is natural that you would feel like a stranger at first.
it'll get better.
she's, uh, she's so small.
the condition she has, it's caused a failure to thrive.
she's so beautiful.
I know.
I sing her to sleep.
Sarah likes...
it's gonna sound stupid, but, uh, I sing madonna songs to her 'cause they're the only ones I know all the words to.
but they work.
she goes to sleep so easy.
Emily screams...
every two hours.
but if I...
put her on my chest, the sound of my heartbeat...
your heartbeat...
it calms her.
Sarah is beautiful, too.
look at her - no, I can'T.
I...I can'T.
you have to.
she's yours.
a mother never leaves her child behind.
Hi.
Hi, sarah.
I thought...
I couldn't watch her die.
and now I can't...
let her go.
I'll get you a tissue.
I'm fine.
it's okay. It's...
it's been a big day.
I'm chief to over 200 physicians.
you call this a big day?
this place is making you soft.
God...
I am a wreck.
long day.
we just sent a man to jail for trying to get rid of his own kid, but...
your day sounds really hard.
I didn't know.
no, of course not.
you spent e entire day dealing with the perils of aromatherapy and, uh, your stripper.
I know you don't believe me, but I like my women real...
real skin...
real breasts...
real lines arountheir eyes that mean they've really lived and had pain.
you show me that woman...
and I'm interested.
And...not in a slippery way.
and, addison...
I think it's great that you try to care of naomi.
but...
who takes care of you?
no ginger.
she can't be her. Ginger cannot be her.
Okay...you're gonna have to translate from freaked-out language to normal-people language.
the first woman you date after me has to be...
she has to--look, she cannot be some stripper with clear platform shoes and
and a suspicious skin condition.
Naomi, eventually I'm going to start dating.
I know that.
and when that happens, you do not get to have a say in who I date.
I know that.
so...
so fine, date.
but it can't be ginger.
and we're back to crazy.
Hey, you know what? I'm a catch.
I-I do "the new york times'" crossword puzzle in pen, I eat vegetables,
I have a very good sense of humor, and I don't do pilates 'cause I think it's fun.
I mean, have you seen me?
if you date ginger after you're with me, if she is what you are choosing, if--if your big dream is rashy-skinned strippers, then what...
what were you-- - what was I doing with you?
Yeah, you know what?
forget it.
the next girl I date will be amazing.
she will be beautiful, she will be intelligent, and she will be rash free.
she'll be better than me?
she will be way better than you.
okay?
okay.
that's sweet. Thank you.
vye, open up.
I think I might need to borrow some tools.
the--the frame's still in one piece.
the wheels came off and the chain, but I-I think I might need a-a blowtorch or a hacksaw.
do you have a hacksaw?
is this helping?
Yeah. Yeah, actually.
it's very therapeutic.
Oh, damn it. I am so full of crap.
I went over to allan's with the bike.
but he'd already gotten one...from cami.
Yes, he told her the bike story.
it took him two years to tell me the bike story.
they've been together, what, a day?
and he told her the bike story.
I'm an idiot. - No, you're not.
no, I am. I am. I am.
he's married. It's over.
I am an idiot.
violet, you are not.
you're just--you're, uh, you're just honest.
that's your fatal flaw.
it's my favorite thing about you.
all right.
come here.
you want to help me run the bike over with my car?
Absolutely.
look at him, st sitting up there with that dumb little dog.
well, if you want, we could...
I mean, you want to go and say hi or...
or you could just look a little longer.
Yeah, the last one.
okay.
it's raining.
it's raining!
it's raining!
you have one saved message.
Hi, babe.
it's me. I'm gonna be late.
you should pick up some chinese and we'll eat in bed, okay?
love you.
Hi, babe. It's me. I'm gonna be late.
you should pick up some chinese and we'll eat in bed, okay?
love you.
you listening to allan's message again?
I have other messages.
from patients.
do those patients ask you to pick up chinese and tell you they love you?
you know what?
I'm sorry I told you about it. I thought you'd understand.
guys don't keep messages from an ex. That's a woman thing.
well, what do you know about women that you didn't get off the internet?
just erase the message.
be a man.
um, mom.
you know, I can drive you to school today?
you know what?
I can-- I can drive her to school.
daddy.
back up, woman.
good girl.
it is raining.
you're wet.
because it is raining.
it rains in seattle, which is where I left my umbrella.
it does not rain in los angeles.
it rains in L. A.
it's raining right now.
Really?
right now?
Maya's staying at sam'S.
for a whole week-- she asked to stay at sam'S.
she's growing up.
I hate her.
are we gonna do the morning meeting?
well, sam's gonna be late 'cause he- - and where's pete?
he is running an errand.
is that a chocolate cake?
Yeah, I made it.
but you can have some if you want.
Addison, you want some chocolate cake?
can I talk to you?
Thanks.
violet says I should come here and talk to you.
I don't believe in it.
but violet says.
she thinks I'm not gonna heal, which is so.
until I say this thing to you, I'm not gonna move on.
that's what she says. I don't know.
but I'm gonna say it.
just in case she's right.
you were a lousy wife, and I hated you.
okay.
there, I said it.
I think maya likes sam better than me.
I think he wins.
where are the beautiful people running in slow motion on the beach?
what?
this is L. A.
l. A.Is supposed to be full of swimming pools and movie stars.
l. A.Is a place that you lured me to with your champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
okay, first of all, you need to start watching more current tv.
and second of all, it's just a little rain.
It'll--it'll pass.
it's not about the rain.
I mean, it is about the rain.
but I would be fine with the rain if everything else was just a little more.
what?
I had this whole dream about.
moving here, that.
it would be.
better and.
special, that I would be.
I don't fit here.
I'm a surgeon.
I think like a scientist.
there's no science to this.
look, dig in, all right?
make friends.
learn to play well with others.
it's raining.
not to get all pete-zen on you, but it's raining everywhere.
we've been talking about this for years.
we've come a long way.
you have come a long way.
you asked me to help you decide what you want, and you have.
you are so close.
I-I just don't know if i can leave her.
you have everything you need.
you have all the tools.
remember?
you're like A. A.
a running back.
a running back, sprinting past the obstacles, running for the goalposts, and you're almost there.
and I'm sitting right here rooting for you.
I am your own personal cheering section.
I just, I-I don't
I should leave her. I should
I should stand up to her.
I-I should fight for my right to be happy.
bring the ball home, doug.
I am telling my wife I want a divorce.
Touchdown!
okay, boundaries, doug. Boundaries.
sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, cathleen, geoffreY.
how was the, uh, wedding?
magical, beautiful, romantic.
everyone should get married.
Yeah. We had a 3-week honeymoon in africa.
we climbed mount kilimanjaro, scaled victoria falls, and now we're back here.
We--I made an appointment with the new O. B.-G. Y.N.
honeymoon baby?
just let us see the doctor!
sorry. We're just eager to
Yeah. Dr. Montgomery, right. Take you right back.
it's just.
on our wedding night, we, uh.
I couldn't even.
what?
we've been married for three weeks, and I haven't been able to do it even once.
sex. You couldn't
she's worried there's something wrong with her.
there is something wrong with me.
my hoo-ha is broken.
so how do you feel?
like it was a waste of time.
how is talking to a rock over my dead wife's body helpful?
you're in a rut.
you're stuck.
you needed to jump-start your emotions, face them.
you know, I hate to disparage yourrofession, but
you know what? I am good. I am brilliant.
I had a patient this morning trapped for 19 years in a marriage.
but today he's ready to ask for a divorce.
I got him out of his rut.
he's ready to move on.
you like yourself an awful lot today.
I kick a at my job.
I rule.
are you the therapist who told my husband to leave me?
is this her? Is this her?
honey.
did you tell my husband to divorce me?
you do.
you do rule.
I don't mean to be a bother.
I had to bring erin back.
she was just so. blue.
well, it's gotta be hard on her.
it's terrible.
but it's normal for kids to feel a little down when they're sick.
it's really nothing to worry about.
what?
no, she's blue.
understood.
light blue.
okay.
what?
Cornflower- - blue.
right.
Yeah, that's a pretty nasty bleed.
Doug, what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
Mr. Midlife crisis here came home, dropped his briefcase in the middle of the living room floor and demanded a divorce.
you're not leaving me. Oh, no, sir.
you made a vow.
I need you to keep your head titled, please, mrs. Adams.
she got upset about the.
then her nose started bleeding, and it wouldt stop.
Mrs. Adams, has your nose ever spontaneously bled before?
no. What are you thinking?
probably just mucosal irritation.
you know, it's not like life witdoug has been a walk in the park, but I'm not a quitter.
I need you to keep your head tilted back, please.
I'm doing the best I can!
I think the best thing to do right now is for everyone to stay calm.
um, was she.
exposed to any water from a well or a spring?
no.
how about antibiotics?
nothing like that.
