looks like they're back at it.
an exact duplicate happened this morning.
now, on your file, I noticed you had no suspects listed, but I'm assuming you had somebody in mind, or a theory at least.
Yeah, there was a guy named, uh, Curtis Brennan.
why did you suspect him?
cause the pieces fit.
he had the smarts, he had the history.
and word was that he spent a lot of cash afterwards.
I just couldn't make it stick.
you think Brennan and his cr could be back at it?
Yeah, they might be...
if they didn't get themselves killed three years ago doing a casino job.
no, I think you're wrong about making a connection with today's heist.
more likely, you were wrong about Brennan to begin with.
Yeah, well, I guess that we're done then, huh?
I think Knox's letter is my favorite.
here he is, what, 27 when he writes it, and he already knows exactly what he's going to accomplish.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.
why am I the only one fascinated by these?
I mean, you worship Knox.
when you taught ergodic theory, you lectured on his work for two weeks.
I think Knox was amazing.
so, why aren't you more excited about these letters?
if I were you, I would be thrilled to write one.
I tell you what.
you can write mine.
Charlie. - What?
both Knox and Newberry were huge proponents of collaborative work.
I'm sure neither of them would roll over in their grave if you did a first draft for me.
why are you so reluctant to do this?
I don't know.
wow, love what you've done with the place.
Oh, well, I've been kind of busy.
then, we're not going to be any help.
uh, we're working on a bank robbery.
Yeah, Don told me-- guys got away seven years ago, and now they've done it again?
but there's no way these were their only two crimes.
I mean, these guys are experienced.
they had to pull other jobs, maybe even got caught somewhere else.
you remember how you helped me on the Sneaker case, how we ran a search algorithm to look for similarities between the current crime and past crimes?
Yeah, we analyzed a break-in and found a suspect who used a similar methodology.
we're hoping you could do the same thing here, maybe tie these guys to a previous crime.
I can take a look.
I'm going to need all the old files.
Yoreally want us to bring them here?
Oh... no. I...
I better come to you.
all right, what?
what, what? - You're clearly pissed.
I mean, you've been giving me the chill ever since we left Bloom's.
what, you think I went too hard on him?
you were getting him to open up, and I shut him down, right?
you really are psychic,'cause yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.
you know, I'm sorry, but a dirty cop is a dirty cop.
you even know what he did? - I know he took a lot of money that wasn't his.
do you know why?
he was chasing this kid who embezzled some money from a bunch of different companies, and he thought the FBI wasn't giving it enough attention.
so, he stole money and then blamed it on the kid?
with no intention of actually keeping it.
you can hear yourself right now, right?
look, the guy logged 30 years.
okay, he ran kidnap rescue.
he ran the bank division.
he won every commendation there is to win.
he did 1, 000 things right in his career, and then messed up once-- that's it.
you know, it's a good thing that you can't read my mind right now.
is it going to disturb you guys if I run through some video?
I don't think anything's going to bother Charlie.
he's in that zone.
I got a week's worth of bank footage to go through.
I'm hoping one of the crew was in to case the place before the robbery.
well, that sounds like a lot of faces.
I'll mark anyone who looks suspicious, go back later and run them against Facial Recognition.
Hey, I think I found something...
or the search algorithm did, and it's not what we were looking for.
what do you mean?
two months ago, someone hit a bank in Riverside.
it's an exact duplicate of a 1994 robbery.
and then, there was another five months ago in...
fountain Valley, and the details match perfectly with a 1989 robbery.
so, it wasn't the first time these guys recycled one of their old heists?
well, uh, that's the thing.
given the dates and the vast differences in their MO,
I would say that none of the original three were committed by the same crew.
meaning...
someone's copycatting old bank robberies.
somehow, they're finding these old crimes, unsolved cases where the FBI or police never even had a suspect.
perfect crimes. - In essence, yeah.
this, uh, a new crew, they're replaying Bank Robberies' Greatest Hits.
these are the three?
Charlie ran a search algorithm on the Farmers American Bank job, see if we the MOs match anything other than just the '02 heist.
and we can't keep doing that?
I mean, we have three more robberies, which means more data.
I mean, more likely you can find similarities, right?
uh, yes, but no because similarities aren't what's important now.
what's important are the differences.
what we really need is a good heuristic anomaly detection scheme
uh, something as simple as, uh-- well, let's say you're using a copy machine.
you're making copies of a number of photographs.
you run each one through the machine and you compare the copies to the originals.
now, similarities are irrelevant.
they're expected. After all, you're making a copy.
however, if you discover differences-- flaws, for example, that aren't in the original
well, now you've got something relevant.
you have found a signature feature of the individual copier.
if we look for enough differences in enough copies...
then we'll be able to tell what photocopier they used.
look at this. All these were checked out recently.
by who?
excuse me.
these three files right here were recently signed out.
we need to know who had them.
should say in the back.
well, whoever it was didn't want their signature to be recognized.
you have to show a badge ID to get 'em, right?
give me the file numbers.
they're all 91A-LAs.
21-245, 13-545, and 41-808.
okay. Those were all checked out by Agent Sinclair.
I'm Sinclair.
I want to know who had them before me.
next back would be Agent Bloom.
agent Roger Bloom?
he checked out a nch of files-- all unsolved bank robberies.
bloom hasn't been an active agent since last November.
why would you let him check out files?
I had no idea he wasn't active.
he was the lead agent on most of the files.
look, David, she's not the one we should be talking to.
thank you.
that your signature?
wow, that is bad penmanship.
all right, for the sake of argument...
Yeah, I'll say yes.
Yeah, for argument's sake, you checked out two dozen old bank files. Why?
because I ran bank division for 14 years and I got nostalgic.
I bet he never thought he'd be back in here again.
you feeling sorry for him?
I'm just saying it's got to be humiliating, being back here like this.
impersonating an FBI agent is a felony.
you know that.
I never told that clerk that I was an active agent.
right, but you never said you weren't either, did you?
what are you doing, Eppes?
what you did to me is not enough already?
are you trying to make a case out of these ancient files?
there was a bank robbery this morning.
okay, every detail of this file recreated.
you checked it out three weeks ago.
are you saying that I robbed the bank?
say you didn't.
I'm not saying another word.
Colby, check this out.
it's two days ago.
guy at the counter.
okay, what about him?
I think he's been casing the place.
that's Bloom.
is all this necessary?
moving him in here, making him play the isolation game like he's some felon.
it is if he is a felon.
don, the guy's an ex-agent.
I mean, that's got to count for something.
Yeah, well, then it cuts both ways.
then he should be cooperating with us.
all right. How long you planning on sweating him?
I want to search his apartment while we got him here.
call Robin and get a rush warrant, all right?
Hey, it's not a debate.
Hey, how's your heuristic anomaly detector thi going?
I'm still working out the initial algorithm.
and did you tell it that ex-Agent Bloom is now our suspect?
well, that would only introduce an unnecessary bias.
w-we don't want to influence the analysis unfairly by presupposing Bloom's guilt.
you sound like Colby.
so how long is it going to take to run?
hopefully I'll have something for you later tonight, maybe tomorrow.
so for now, the only connection between the current crimes is the obvious one-- Bloom.
page three of the FBI interrogation manual.
after the initial isolation period, "try to establish a rapport with the suspect
through a token gesture, like a candy bar, cup of coffee... bottle of water."
all right, so how do you want to do this?
want to go room by room or you want to split it up?
I don't have to keep an eye on you or anything in here, do I?
you're not gonna do anything stupid? - Is that a joke?
I mean, you're not gonna try to cover anything up or leave some kind of sign so Bloom would know we were here.
really, you think that I'd do that?
well, normally, no, but I can't geany kind of handle on you on this one.
your last investigation...
we're not going all the way back to Kevin Oliver's case, are we?
well, there's $10 million missing.
I don't care that IA couldn't prove it.
you and I both know you took it.
the only thing we both know is that every penny was returned.
Yeah, well, that leaves yo $10 million light.
and maybe if you talked to me, but you don't.
look, I just see you feeling sorry for this guy, defending him, and I just can't make any sense out of it.
you know, Nik, I don't know how much anybody might have told you about my father.
I know he died when you were 15.
he was going up into the mountains on a fishing tp.
there was 20 miles of road and there was a steel guardrail that...
...covered every single inch of it...
...except for one 50-yard stretch.
that's the spot that his truck went off the cliff.
I'm sorry.
that is some serious bad luck.
Yeah, it's either bad luck or that's the spot he was aiming for.
what, you think he killed himself?
I'll never know.
all I do know is that he spent 20 years as a foreman in a machine shop pounding out tractor parts.
then he makes one mistake and they can him.
he just never get over how that one mistake just erased everything else that he'd done for them.
you do a lot of thinking since you got fired?
play it over and over in your head?
maybe you started to rationalize.
you're the one that was wronged, you're the victim.
now you're on page 19 of theanual.
attempt to agitate the suspect, elicit an emotional reaction.
Oh, come on, Eppes.
I spent 30 years on that side of the table.
you're not going to get a confession out of me.
and without a confession, what have you got?
I got you in the bank two days before the robbery.
I got you with a file detailing it three weeks before that.
maybe there's a whole other explanation.
so give it to me, Roger.
let me help you.
help me like you helped me right out of a career.
you think I wanted to do that, really?
pal, I joined the Bureau 'cause of guys like you.
it killed me to turn you in.
you gave me no choice.
it was my sister, Eppes.
he took every penny of her life savings.
what wouldn't you do for your brother?
Hey, Colby, in here.
southern Coast Savings and Loans.
he's got blueprints, photos, diagrams of traffic patterns.
he's even drawn out the interior.
here's a copy of an FBI file.
robbery at this very bank in 1998.
let me guess. Unsolved?
looks like Bloom's got plans.
you know, you guys are just shining examples of law enforcement.
I don't have to give you the whole "don't leave town" speech, do I?
Oh, please.
no way he'll know you were there, right?
we were careful.
what is this for? - It's for you.
don't get too excited until you see what it is. - All right.
Oh, it's a pen.
to write the letter.
don't tell me you didn't see that one coming.
why is this so important to you?
for the same reasons it should be important to you.
she's not going to let up, you know that, Charlie?
and I have to say I think she's right.
I know she's right. I know I should write this letter.
I just don't know what the future holds, so...
well, what do you want it to hold?
write about that.
Yeah, what about your emergence work?
you seemed to having a real breakthrough a few weeks ago.
Yeah, and then my brother got stabbed and then there was the serial killer case.
and what does that got to do with writing the letter?
never mind.
thank you for the pen.
anyone got eyes on him?
nothing yet, but we have got a clear view of the side approach.
Colby, how about you?
negative.
man, this guy's been dragged in and grilled.
he's already got the take from the last three robberies.
if it was me, I'd just quit while I was ahead.
now, the crime he's copying from '89-- they hit just after lunch, so if they're following the old plan...
wait a minute. I got him.
gold four-door rolling down Sixth.
Yeah, I got him. Looks like he's alone.
you didn't really think he'd come, did you?
Oh, what's he doing?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. On them.
Yeah, looks like we got more players in a two-tone Chrysler.
all right, let's hold tight, everyone.
let them get in for SWAT.
bad guys are moving.
all right, Bloom's out.
Oh, what the hell is he doing?
Freeze! - He's gonna try and stop them.
bloom, put the gun down!
put it down, Bloom.
why isn't he in cuffs?!
he wasn't with them, Don.
Yeah, he wasn't, all right?
he was actually trying to stop them.
how did you know they'd be here, Bloom?
14 years in the bank division, Eppes.
I figured it out.
I almost had them at the last job.
wait a minute. You've been working this case from the beginning?
five months. Ever since the Fountain Valley job.
I've been way out ahead of you guys.
that's why you had the files, that's why you were in the bank.
didn't I tell you there was another explanation? - Come on, give me those hands.
Oh, are you kidding me? - Give me your hands.
I... A prior knowledge of a felony, failed to report it.
you're an accessory, Bloom.
not in a million years.
you endangered all these people around here, not to my agents.
not one person got hurt, except, of course, for a bad guy, Don.
let me make this as clear as possible, okay?
you are not an agent.
you are nobody as far as this case goes.
he's got the message, Don.
Charlie, what are you doing here?
I caught it on the scanner.
we got 'em, huh? - No, it wasn't Bloom.
he was chasing them, just like us.
we've been overlooking something. Information flow.
the guys we're after had to have learned the details of the original heists somewhere, right?
Yeah, until now, we thought they got it from the FBI file.
but if it's not Bloom?
where would they learn about the crimes?
it's not like there's a bank robber newsletter, or a social club where they sit around and swap stories.
yeah there is-- prison.
maybe somebody from the new crew did time with one of the old guys, right?
old guys get to bragging about scores they pulled off, but never got caught for.
if the new guy's a good listener, and takes good notes.
Charlie, isn't there some sort of social network analysis you can use?
figure out where and when their paths might have crossed?
no, no. Not with two pools of unknown variables.
see, the new crew had to have learned the details of the old crimes from the old crews, but right now, we don't know enough about either group.
believe it or not, it's not unlike, uh, decorator crabs.
a decorator crab camouflages itself by collecting tiny bits of its environment, and sticking them on its back.
as a result, if you looked at just the decorator crab alone, you could get a pretty good sense of what its habitat looks like.
conversely, if you looked at just the habitat, you could make a pretty good guess as to what the decorator crab would look like.
and the problem is, we don't know enough about the habitat, we don't know enough about the crab.
there's no way to use one to make a determination about the other.
what now, Granger? What could there possibly be left to say?
you're gonna need a ride back to your car.
listen, Bloom, for what it's worth,
I know what it's like to be the agent on the outside.
I was cuffed, interrogated and locked up by my own team.
but you cleared your name, didn't you?
for good or for bad, it's forgotten.
you know why? Because up there, it's all short-term memory.
they only remember the last thing you did.
look, I read the paper, I saw the bank robbery, I made the connection.
I thought, this is my chance.
bust the bank crew, you give them something new to remember you by?
so, maybe you could just kind of keep me in the loop here, you know?
bloom, you got to let it go.
listen to me. The only reason you're not locked up right now is because it'd be bad press.
an ex-agent triggers a shoot-out while a dozen current agents look on?
but I guarantee you, you mess with this again, they'll get over the embarrassment.
look, I know that I messed up with the Kevin Oliver case.
I accept that.
but I can't let that be the last thing I did.
it's all right. I'm unarmed.
no pen, no pad of paper.
I know. I've got 'em right here.
you're writing the letter.
let me ask you something.
it has to do with the letter.
actually, it's more about us. - Okay.
you know, there's never been any question as to what I was supposed to do with my life.
I was eight when they called it destiny that I would go on to achieve some level of academic greatness.
you should be writing this down. - Oh, no, no, no. Wait, wait.
when we met, I was that math wunderkind on the rise.
uh, and the whole time we've been together, you've pretty much known what you've signed on for.
pretty much, right?
so, I guess, uh, this is a, uh, "would you still love me if..." question.
if the ride turned out to be something else entirely, and if I didn't fulfill the destiny...
is that why you haven't really moved into the office?
and why you're so stuck on the letter?
because you don't think you're worthy?
Charlie, you belong in that office.
you are every bit as talented as Beiderman or Knox or any of them.
trust me.
all right, knock it off, you two.
Charlie, you got visitors.
Hey, Charlie, you remember Roger Bloom?
Yeah, sure. How you doing?
so I was thinking he could give you some help with the case.
I already have the files.
I know facts that never made it into the files.
I was the lead agent.
I mean, I'll tell you right now.
unless you can give me suspects...
I can. All right, not official suspects.
just suspicions that I had working on the case.
Charlie, the fact is, he has been way out ahead of us on this one.
what's my brother going to say about this?
I'll work on Don.
I can help you.
looks close to the description of that bank suspect you guys are looking for.
didn't want to touch him till we figured out whether he was yours or not.
what do you think?
it's him. That's right where I tagged him.
my guess is, whoever dumped him here figured he wouldn't be found so quick.
why do you say that?
building remodel's been stalled a couple of months.
contractor just happened to come by to pick up some equipment.
you guys are lucky.
uh, luckier than this guy, anyway. Thanks.
what you're saying has absolutely no scientific validity. - So what?
we know that they show a preference for targets with easy ingress and egress.
right, but their pattern of behavior is going to change now that they know they're being pursued.
listen, imagine that you're a mountain goat, trying to get to the next peak, and you know that there is a snow leopard in the valley below.
a mountain goat?
how about if I imagine that I'm a bank robber looking for a target?
whatever. - Look, look.
look, you may be coming at this from two different directions, but the question remains the same.
there are nine so-called perfect crimes in the files that these guys have not reenacted yet.
you're right. But whatever they choose, they're looking fo one last big hit.
well, yeah, it is likely that they are going to want to choose a target that offers a greater payout.
so, uh, we're in agreement?
what?
they're, uh...
they're making progress.
only reason you're here is 'cause Colby stood up for you.
I want you to understand that.
we found the point of convergence.
Everyonehat Roger suspected in the original crime did time at Lompoc at one point or another, so we're thinking it's some one from the new crew who was incarcerated with them.
so that's how they found out about the heists?
we just can't figure out where they're gonna hit next.
LAPD found the body of a guy named Billy Devarro, one of the crew from yesterday.
let me guess. He did a lot of time at Lompoc, too.
no, but his brother Teddy did.
the guys are on their way to pick him up now.
FBI! We have a warrant!
clear.
the bathroom's clear.
clear.
Oh, he's cleared out. - It's too late. We missed him.
take a look at this.
it's the recon for their last few jobs.
I don't see anything that said where they're going next, though.
all right, that's it.
with Devarro, the pieces fit.
they're going to recreate the 1981 holdup at the downtown Federal Reserve.
Oh, come on. You sagree with me again?
no, I completely agree with you.
well, I'm confused. What's the problem?
whoever's doing this is preserving every detail of the original crimes.
the 19 heist-- 11 people slaughtered.
all right-- 1981, four men enter the Federal Reserve building downtown before it opens.
there are two security guards, eight employees and one of the employees' wives in the bank.
now, the cre used Periformol, which is a Vietnam-era poison gas.
most likely, they l died before they even knew that they were being robbed.
once they got rid of all their witnesses, they used magnesium burn bars.
they cut right through a side wall of the vault.
the take: a little less than $2 million.
a Vietnam-era gas?
that has to be inert by now, if it hasn't all been destroyed.
and all federal vaults have been fortied since.
Yes, they were, in direct response to this robbery.
so, duplicating the old crime won't work.
it will if they modernize it.
look, same crime, 21st Century tools.
it's consistent with my anomaly detection scheme.
one of the differences between the copies and the originals...
you don't use the magnesium burn bars.
you have a laser cutter, maybe.
all right, so what about the gas?
I'm thinking Haldite nerve gas.
based on what? - And from where?
the U. S. signed the Chemical Weapons Convention back in '93.
but there's a facility in Seal Beach that contracts with the government, and they destroy chemical weapons collected overseas.
now, they had a break-in six weeks ago.
a security guard that works tre is being detained right now, but they still haven't recovered the Haldite that was taken.
we need to talk with that security guard.
six weeks in federal holding, Marcus.
no visitors, no phone calls.
it sounds like you got nobody.
I don't need nobody,'cause I got nothing to say.
Yeah, we heard you've been real quiet.
but how are you going to feel when six weeks turns into six months or six years?
want to hear my guess?
I think you're holding out for one of those big paydays somewhere down the line.
that's why you can deal with all this:
cause you know if you keep quiet about the gas and you protect who has it, you're going to get some big, uh, cash reward somewhere in the end.
but here's the wrench in your plans.
we already know who has the gas and what he plans to do with it.
that's a load of crap.
you ever play Clue, Marcus?
Oh, I'm going to guess Teddy Devarro, in the Federal Reserve with the Haldite gas.
looklike I win.
I don't know how much Teddy promised you.
Marcus, that payday is not coming.
and if people die from the gas that you helped steal, they will put you down.
what do you want?
tell us where to find Teddy and the gas.
all right, I see movement.
there's definitely someone in there.
you try a mass evacuation, you tip them off, it could get very ugly.
Hey, you're just here to watch, okay? - I'm just saying.
listen up, everyone. I want to keep SWAT and Hazmat out of sight.
clear the businesses on both sides.
we hit them tonight, we'll get less people around.
it doesn't look like much, does it?
it scares me.
this one looks empty.
it's all locked up.
I'm clearing store to the east.
I don't believe it.
don, there's someone out front right now.
David, Liz, stop. Stop where you are.
open the damn door! - Go, go!
we gotta hit it-- send SWAT on the back. We're going!
stay right here.
door is locked.
okay, okay, I'm coming out!
drop the gun!
nice and easy-- don't move. Don't move!
come here!
put your hands behind your back. Turn around.
Where's Devarro?
where the hell is that damn canister?
yo, check this out.
it leads out the building.
he is coming out the front.
he's getting away-- he's coming out the front.
no, no, my baby! - Back up!
my baby, please! - Shut up!
please don't hurt my baby. - You know what this is, don't you?
Teddy, you're not going anywhere.
no, my baby! - Back off!
Terry, put it down!
back! Back!
my baby! - Back off!
get out! Get out, get out now! Get out.
got it, got it, got it.
don't move, don't move!
okay. Okay. I got it.
so, you just don't listen, huh?
old habits.
about 1, 000 ways that could have gone wrong.
YeahBut it didn't.
we got lucky.
that's the best I'm ever going to get out of Eppes.
he's right, you know.
but I'll tell you something.
people will be talking about that one for a long time.
you know, I gave the Bureau my whole life.
never got married, none of that stuff.
but, man, if I had a son...
thank you very much.
my pleasure.
Hey, uh, David said there's a kick-ass pizza place down the street, so we're going to go get something to eat, so if you want to come...
Yeah, I'm starving.
actually, I wasn't talking to you, Granger, but, uh, I guess you can come, too, if you want.
what do you say? - I can eat.
dang. Nice digs.
well, I don't understand. Dad said it was like a disaster, like my room when I was 15.
he was right, by the way.
um, no, Amita came by today and did all this.
that's nice of her.
you've definitely arrived, kid.
I've arrived.
don't know how long I'm set to stay.
what are you talking about?
you've been working for this your whole life.
my destiny, right?
what if my future has changed, you know?
what if it's not being an academic?
what, you mean the FBI stuff?
you don't seem to have a problem doing both.
it's become increasingly difficult for me to be here in this bubble lecturing about set theory, knowing that there are real lives at risk, that there are real lives being lost out there.
you know, Charlie, I've seen a lot of good agents burn out.
you know, guys that just don't want to go home because they're afraid they'll miss something.
what is...
I don't know about the whole destiny thing.
you've had it pounded into your head since you were a kid.
why don't you just...
do what you want on any given day? Okay?
just live a little.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, I do.
am I interrupting something?
no, I was just, uh, heading out, actually.
good. 'Cause I need Charlie.
all right. Congratulations.
uh, looks nicer than my apartment. See you later.
I'm taking you to dinner.
I owe you for fixing up my office.
no, actually, I owe you.
I screwed something up.
let's go. - Okay.
where are we going?
Brianni's, and we're late.
Brianni's, wow. You must have really screwed up.
Charlie, um... the other night, when we were talking in the garage about e letters and the office, and, um, you asked me a question...
the "Would you still love me if... " thing?
and I went on and on about you doubting yourself and you deserving the office, which I'm not retracting or anything, but I realized that I never answered your question.
there is no "if."
I love you no matter what.
there aren't any conditions on that.
you're amazing, you know that?
No! Charlie, help me! Let me go!
no, Charlie, help me!
let go of me! No! Charlie!
sorry for the short notice. It's just the one grad seminar.
Oh, yes, yes. Not a problem. Happy to help.
all right. Here are my lecture notes.
they're pretty-pretty self-explanatory.
mathematical Physics. Fun.
so, what's so important that you have to miss it?
uh, you know, Amita and I have been offered visiting professorships at Cambridge.
so we decided to move the wedding date up to, uh, to today.
Aw, thank you.
Oh, I wish I had a visiting professorship.
my shirt fits you pretty well.
Ah, it's a little big.
not that we had a lot of advance notice.
what? I mean, did you really want a big wedding?
no.
actually, I-I'm kind of relieved.
Yeah. I'm excited.
I think this will be good.
do you really need that?
what do you mean? I'm on duty.
Ah. You ready?
are you kidding?
watching a son get married?
I've been waiting for this a long time.
all right.
it's a lovely day, an auspicious day.
there he is.
Hey.
Hey. Hey, guys.
so, where's Don?
Ah, he's bringing my dad.
Where's the bride?
she's in her office. My dad's going to walk her down.
Where's the minister?
that would be me.
you're a clergyman?
I thought you were a monk.
I'm also a minister of the Universal Life Church.
a credential acquired, uh, specifically for this occasion.
is that the one you sign up for online?
I don't take casually the responsibility vested in me.
I wouldn't imagine you would.
Liz is at the office.
we drew straws and she had to stay and answer phones.
you ready? Hey.
I'd better be.
all right.
any words of advice?
Oh, yes.
if you want to get out of it, now's the time to run like hell.
no, I'm serious.
you are.
I remember on my wedding day,
I had this thought, "What if I just walk away?
stay single, you know?
live alone and take things simple and easy.
and over the years, you know, I,uh...
I often thought about that other guy, that other me.
on his own, free to do whatever he wanted, a life so simple with a lot of fun. Whereas mine, well... it got a little complicated, and sometimes painful and...
anyway...
I never envied that other guy.
not once.
shall we?
Yeah.
are you ready?
at the request of the bride and groom,
I will keep my remarks short and nontechnical.
so, I wonder what the technical version sounds like.
I heard that.
we've been talking here about the forces that bind the universe.
but what binds humans?
love.
powerful in small spaces, yet with profound effect on distance.
love defies time, outliving both its source and its object.
love is faster than light, for light requires time in order to travel through space, but love reaches its object instantaneously.
love journeys forever, into infinity, and it's here, binding together two lives.
do we have the rings?
symbolic of eternity and rendered in a beautiful element.
do you take Charles Edward Eppes to be your husband?
Yes, I do.
do you take Amita Ramanujan to be your wife?
I do.
I pronounce you husband and wife.
sparkling cider.
no champagne. We got to go back to work.
Oh, hey, by the way, um...
we're having a little party at the house before they leave, so everybody's invited.
good, I still need to buy a gift.
I'm in the same state of delinquency.
I think you caught us all by surprise.
so, when are you guys flying out to London?
three days. It's hard to believe.
Yeah, so, how does it feel?
feels good.
right? Mm-hmm.
of course, we still got a million things to do before we leave.
and not a lot of time to get them done.
it was Liz.
LAPD located Ted Dacosta.
here in LA?
an informant spotted him 20 minutes ago at a restaurant in Larchmont.
what's that?
this case we've been working on for, like, two years.
go ahead.
you sure? I got classes.
only my morning's covered.
I'm sorry. We'll celebrate later.
don't forget to be there. Party. I won't.
we don't have an address on him.
we don't even know if he's staying in town.
let's grab him.
Yeah, I want the right guy to move it because I have so much invested in this.
no. You gotta be kidding.
no, we're not kidding you.
you're arresting me? For what?
that's right. Confidence fraud, computer fraud, financial fraud...
confidence fraud?
you mean, you're a con man?
this is a mistake. I'll get it cleared up.
you said you were a real estate agent.
you had this property investment thing.
I gave you $35, 000!
sir, calm down and step back.
No! He stole my money!
get off.
you GOT IT ALL. ALL MY ...
...FREEZE.
don't MOVE.
what's wrong?
my gun! Someone grabbed my gun!
so, LAPD has a couple bystanders who say they can describe the guy.
he was Caucasian, medium build, brown hair.
we've got officers canvassing.
if we're lucky, it might be someone living close by.
well, he had on jeans, they were rolled up.
these boots.
work boots?
brown leather, you know, good quality, like, hip-looking.
okay, we'll add that, see if we can make a decent composite, but honestly, it's a long shot.
Yeah. Thanks.
look, somebody picks a cop gun up off the street, chances are, they're gonna brag about it.
not if they plan to use it.
right, but maybe they plan to stick it in a drawer...
that's not the point.
I know. I get it-- it's your gun, and anything that happens, you'll feel responsible.
no. I am responsible.
okay, so we arrive at Heathrow on Saturday.
we can spend Sunday in London before heading out to Cambridge.
Oh, that's great. I've always wanted to see the War Cabinet Rooms Museum.
uh, I was thinking something a little more romantic.
the Tower of London?
that's romantic. No, it's not.
you going somewhere?
huh? Yeah.
I'm going to take a look at some condos over by Old Town. I'll, um...
catch up.
didn't you tell him that in India, it's tradition for parents to livewith their married children?
I did, and he said that this isn't India.
it doesn't seem right for him to move out of this house.
you know, I know you own it, but...
no, and it's his house.
he always said that he wanted to find his own place after I got married, and this is all happening so fast, and now he's set on it.
Glock 19? Yeah.
academy gun?
uh, no. It was my second one.
you've had this piece...?
six years.
feel like you've lost a hand, huh?
that cannot be any fun.
Yeah.
I remember when I was issued my first gun.
I couldn't believe I was expected to keep it on me all the time.
after about a month, it's automatic.
it becomes a part of you.
Yeah. It doesn't have your name on it, but it might as well.
you know?
losing your gun is one thing. But knowing it's out there and someone else has it...
if we have any shot at recovering this thing, it's now, right?
when people might still be talking about it.
I'll check with some guys at Parker Center.
you know, I know a few who work with informants in that area.
and one more. Signature at the bottom.
we're going to need the Bureau to send over the original ballistics.
for the unlikely scenario that your gun is used in a crime.
can you believe I used to ride a bike to campus?
given your propensity for mechanical mishaps, the world became a safer place when you opted for applied mathematics over engineering.
boy, it's going to be weird not being here.
CalSci has been my home, for how long now?
well, why all this sentiment?
I mean, you'll be back soon enough.
no one steps twice in the same river.
Oh, yes. Heraclitus, the weeping philosopher.
it'll be different when I come back.
I mean, I'm moving on to a new part of my life.
well, so are you.
every element in the universe exists in a state of constant change and becoming.
you know, I think it's important to let go of the things to which we've grown accustomed, becoming mature, gaining self-knowledge.
all these trappings we surround ourselves with.
you want my office, don't you?
well, I'm changing, too, Charles All part of the cosmic flux.
and, uh...
Yes, I would like your office.
don heard we were making some checks into finding his gun.
what did he say?
to treat it like any other case of theft of federal property.
in other words, don't put a lot of time into it.
he just...
Where's Nikki?
putting a lot of time into it, working her LAPD contacts.
good.
what's up?
I was hoping to tell you guys all together.
um, I was offered a job in D. C. running an anticorruption team.
I decided to take it.
that's a prestigious job.
Yeah, I'm still kinda getting used to the idea.
we cool?
we cool? Of course we're cool, man.
we had to break up at some point, right?
people were starting to talk.
don know yet?
he was the one that recommended me.
I mean, it doesn't sound like you could have done anything differently.
it's just one of those unexpected things, right?
but you seem troubled by it.
it's the way it happened, Dad, you know?
I mean, it was right in front of me.
Yeah.
wonder what that guy was thinking.
could have just gone off and bought a gun, couldn't he?
not if he doesn't want it linked to him.
so you're worried that he's gonna use it.
this might sound funny coming from me, but, uh, as they say: "It isn't guns that shoot people.
it's people that shoot people.
Yeah, well, I'm responsible for it.
you trying to get it back?
Yeah, I'm trying to get it back, but it's not like they can give it special attention 'cause it's my gun.
you know, reason tells us that what can be lost can be found.
I'd like to help you get your gun back.
Charlie, you guys are leaving, all right?
and look, I do not want you worrying about it.
here's the bag you wanted. Enjoy it. Use it in good health.
Thanks. I've got three days.
I hate walking away from a problem.
Yeah, well, it's not your problem. Okay, so I'm gonna get a plane, go to Europe while your gun is still out there? Yes.
you know, we can't keep doing this forever.
Oh, yes, you can.
until you're just two old crime fighters with bladder problems?
well, yeah, without the bladder problems.
Oh, great.
all right, I'm on my way.
LAPD has a lead on my gun, so...
I'll see you guys later.
these two were known drug dealers, Don.
both had records for assault.
both shot with the same gun.
nine mil?
preliminary tests on the recovered shell casings match the murder weapon to your Glock.
nobody looks too upset.
residents complained for months about these two.
they sold to kids and brought in a bad element.
a community watch group kept an eye on them, but LAPD was never able to make an arrest.
victims like this, the shooters could be anybody
rival drug gangs, robbers, locals.
they're dozens of suspects.
so this shooting gives us a second location on the gun.
narrows the search field considerably.
well, the more the gun is used, the more data we've got even if bad things are generating that data.
I think Don feels responsible for the shootings.
well, why? His actions aren't the cause.
Yeah. You'd think he'd blame the man who walked away with his gun or the guy who knocked it out of his hand.
Yeah, or the guy they arrested.
I mean, he set the whole chain of events in motion.
you know, we keep thinking we can gauge cause and effect, but we can't.
maybe just a small fraction of possible consequences.
you know, if I had known that volunteering for the FBI
I would again be tethering myself to an electronic device!
I think I just inadvertently tweeted.
I've been doing a NSA-style keyword search on the Internet to find mention of a gun matching Don's on gun sellers' Web sites.
what did you get? There's something weird going on.
there are a ton of mentions of a cop's gun, but not on sale sites.
on social networking sites: Facebook, Twitter, craigslist, others.
the social networking sites, what are they saying?
that this gun has taken care of a problem that the cops couldn't handle.
someone posted these photos.
we're trying to track whoever posted this.
with every hour, dozens more posts talk about it.
wait. So Don's gun has gone viral?
the message is that this gun solves problems that good people have with bad people.
it's...
it's the vigilante gun.
can we run this stuff down, you know, find out where it is now?
there are hundreds of screen names and Web sites to track.
you know who could really help with this?
even when we rule out the false positives, there's a lot of mentions that clearly refer to Don's gun.
well, a Glock 19 dropped by an FBI agent during an arrest is definitely a specific data set.
shouldn't be too hard to perform a social networking analysis.
identify our actors and map their actions.
actors?
people using the networks.
we'll build a model that focuses on individuals.
that'll allow us to view the structural network environment that provides opportunities for their actions.
that's beyond my skill set.
Yeah, I've called for reinforcements.
social network models interpret the structure of human relationships:
social, economic, political.
Yes, yes, you'll need an adjacency matrix for the network data.
adjacency matrix. Okay, Go for it.
Hey, Larry, you gonna be able to handle all this FBI stuff while I'm in Cambridge?
no.
no, you're not?
uh, not by myself, no.
you know, like Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes,
I prefer to do the conceptualizing, leaving the grunt work to others.
well, with me and Amita both away, who's gonna be your algorithm slave?
he stands at your chalkboard.
if you express the nodes in this manner, you can identify relational ties as channels for transfer or flow of material resources.
I had no idea that graph theory could be so much fun.
Otto, is this true?
you're gonna help him on FBI cases? Am I?
Oh, excellent.
a chance to show what physicists can do.
you mathematicians, you had your shot.
they're talking about my gun on the Internet?
how do you know if any of this stuff is real?
we know when and where it was stolen, we know it was used in Highland Park.
we've got the list of suspects.
we've got anchoring facts, and we're gonna get more.
you're talking about one gun in all of L. A.
you know about the six degrees of separation phenomenon?
Yeah. In math, the same thing is called the small world problem.
by using principles of the small world problem, we build an algorithm to filter through millions of social links, and identify individuals using local information, like the Internet, to create paths in the network for a specific purpose;
the transfer of your gun.
so in essence, we turn the immense social network of Los Angeles into the equivalent of a small town.
Charlie, what are you doing?
what are you doing?
you're not trying to postpone all this now, are you?
no.
look, this is my problem.
you got to live your life.
you know, most of our lives we've lived in completely separate worlds.
I don't want to go back to that.
Yeah, I hear you. I know.
but I don't think we will.
we won't be working together.
that doesn't matter.
Thanks.
Hey, LAPD got a break in the drug dealer shooting.
print on a shell casing matched a member of the community watch group, a guy who got into a shoving match with the victims when he was taking photos of them.
they run a GSR?
Yeah, he recently fired a weapon.
I was cleaning the garage, found some old fireworks.
that's where the gunpowder traces came from.
that's not gonna hold up. It has to.
I didn't shoot anybody.
you knew the victims.
you argued with them days before they died.
me and a lot of people.
their buyers mugged kids walking home from school.
78-year-old woman had her arm broken by one of their customers.
got it off the suspect's BlackBerry.
he posted a message online saying he put the gun in a trash can in an alley.
LAPD says it's already gone.
who did you pass the gun to?
no idea what you're talking about.
this is Evelyn Ryerson. She's got a couple of DUIs and several traffic accidents, mostly minor, but about six months ago, she injured two people at a crosswalk.
what's she even doing behind the wheel?
she's got no license. This is her brother's car, taken without permission.
an empty fifth of gin on the floor.
just wouldn't stop driving, so somebody decided to stop her.
I think people are saying it's okay to take the law into their own hands.
Yeah, with my gun.
Evelyn Ryerson's murder looks like a vigilante act.
the chronic alcoholic, menace behind the wheel.
we got dozens of suspects.
see, I can sort through those suspects two ways:
by motivation and by opportunity.
she was shot close to home.
I'll weight her neighbors pretty high.
a lot of fake IDs and anonymous posts to go through.
you can hide your name- it's a lot harder to hide your motive.
she was set to check into a rehab facility in three days.
she paid for it in advance.
two months.
Really? She was trying to change.
Yeah. She made her move a little bit too late.
what's bothering you? This is about more than just losing your gun, isn't it?
Yeah, you know, it's the gun. It's the whole thing.
just trying to decide what to do, where to go.
it's tough when you're not being given obvious choices.
you're not being assigned to something.
your family doesn't need your help.
it's just you and what you want to do.
what it is, is I have this crazy take on all this.
what's that?
like losing my gun is some sort of test.
and if I don't find it, that means I should leave the Buru.
I don't think that you can let a chance occurrence have that much influence on you.
Yeah, but if I can't do more good than harm, you know, I shouldn't be doing this.
so, this garage was built the same year the house was?
Yeah. Yeah, 1908.
never done much to it.
probably needs a lot of work.
Yeah. Indeed, it does.
Charlie, I think I found something here.
okay, I've tracked a thread of messages on Victim-Aidline to different sites and servers.
most users have a shielded ID or account, but not this one.
do you know that that's her real name?
well, it's linked to Web sites for her jobs, her kid's schools...
looks genuine.
she's arranged to pick up the gun.
why would she use her real name?
well, she used a screen name, "BusyMom8."
most people think that's enough to hide who they really are.
well, then, we might have just found Don's gun.
I found the gun in a bag in a park.
through an arrangement you made on a Web site called Victim-Aidline.
who was your contact?
it was anonymous.
why did you want the gun?
my ex-boyfriend beat me up.
he said he'd kill me if I broke up with him.
so, your solution was to shoot him?
I got a restraining order, but that just enraged him.
I have an eight-year-old daughter, and I am not leaving her alone.
so, when I read about a gun that couldn't be traced to me...
then when I actually held it in my hand,
I realized what I'd have to do with it.
so, I understand he's in jail now?
he came to my work, and one of my coworkers called the police.
they arrested him.
well, the system did work.
I don't know how long he's gonna be locked up.
I'm moving. I'm changing my name.
I've got no new job.
I don't know where my daughter's going to school.
if that is the system working...
Where's the gun now?
I put a message on Victim-Aidline and got a response.
I left it where they asked me to, by a bus bench in Silver Lake.
we're gonna need a name.
all I know is Jim.
we found the bus bench and the bushes, but the gun was already gone.
there are some 20 sets of prints on the bench, so we're running those down.
any street cams in the area?
Bo ends of the street.
one side was a bank, the other was a gas station.
we got the techs looking at the tapes right now.
we have some 800 people registered at Victim-Aidline, 37 named James or Jim.
of course.
too bad the name wasn't Eustice.
Yeah. The top three Jims on the list...
so one guy was injured in a bar fight.
the other one's got a neighbor who's bullying everybody on the block.
there's a third one who...
he threatened a man who was acquitted of raping his adult daughter.
I'm not shooting him.
I'm suing the bastard.
you're filing a civil suit against your daughter's rapist?
in a civil suit, we don't need proof beyond reasonable doubt.
and we can strip him clean, take everything he owns or will earn for another ten years.
I told the cops Stan hit me.
he denied it. My word against his.
you posted on a Web site that if you had a gun that couldn't be traced, you'd use it.
I was drunk when I wrote that.
did you get a gun?
look, Agent, I'm not an idiot, okay?
and besides, he didn't kill me.
like they say, "An eye for an eye..."
I just want him to wind up like this.
call the police a dozen times, nothing happens.
post on a message board, I've got the FBI in my house.
you indicated an interest in acquiring a stolen gun.
no. I only made some comments.
about what you would do with it.
you said you were gonna use it on your neighbor, Michael Hiller.
no.
okay, I-I... I wrote some things
I probably shouldn't have. That's it.
listen, if I get a gun, I'm buying it legally.
a gun is not going to solve a conflict with a neighbor.
a conflict with a neighbor.
Yeah, you cops always make it sound like it's a two-way thing.
he's crazy.
he dumps his garbage on people's lawns.
but if you say anything to him about it, the next day, your windshield's smashed.
our neighbor down the street tried to have a backyard barbecue.
he started to throw things over the fence into their yard, screaming that they were disturbing him.
our dog got out, ran into his yard.
he kicked her so hard, he nearly killed her.
I go over to talk to him about it, he punches me in the face, broke my nose.
did you report this?
Yes, I reported it.
the police told me that it was a mutual dispute.
they told me to stay off his property.
the next day, all four tires on my car are slashed.
he taunts us, he says he knows how to do whatever he wants to do without being caught.
and the cops say that unless you catch Hiller in the act, there's nothing you can do.
with or without your gun, this situation is not going to end well.
Yeah. Let's see what we can do about that guy, huh?
Jim Mazzolla may or may not have Don's gun, but he sure as hell has motivation to use itbecause of this guy.
Mike Hiller, the neighbor.
this guy's just a malignant narcissist who gets off on scaring people.
he sets his own rules and wants everybody else to play by them.
Yeah, these types know how to cause damage without getting caught, and they don't stop.
you think Mazzolla would actually use a gun?
I don't know.
he feels helpless, and this family...
they are scared to death.
I know. We got a lot of other Jims to look at, too.
we need to find a way to narrow it down.
Hey, I got something for you guys to take a look at.
so, Amita and I have a Bayesian filter, a spam filter, if you will.
we set it loose in the message boards with the post about Don's gun.
this message thread is for people who can't get police help
cases of harassment, abuse.
Yeah, by estranged spouses, business disputes, neighborhood conflicts. Right, we took the membership list, cross-referenced it with police reports, and got a high score on this name.
so you're rerunning the Bayesian filter for verification.
I'm not sure what help a plasma physicist can provide for a pure mathematical analysis.
well, it's the same as a cosmologist.
I mean, critical thinking.
and any good equation monkey needs to be familiar with the applicable tools of mathematical crime fighting.
equation monkey?
that's what Einstein used to call his very good friend and mathematical contributor, Marcel Grossmann.
has anyone noticed how compromised the integrity of these load-bearing elements are?
what, you mean, do Charlie and Alan realize the garage roof is sagging?
Yes, yes. The roof. Really saggy.
you know, I tell you, it is odd how they've let this garage deteriorate, especially given how much time they spend here.
this is a good space.
you know, you could do something with this place.
Yes, yes, yes, like-like park cars.
Amita, as co-owner of this home, would you consider Mmm.
a possible, oh, redefining of this particular space?
if you're thinking what I'm thinking,
I would be very interested.
good. Good.
I love topological problems.
Otto, you do realize we're talking about remodeling the garage?
I thought we were possibly discussing defects and electronic properties in graphene, but...
uh... no.
not this time.
who the hell are you?
you can't come on my property.
we understand you've having some problems with the neighbors.
I handle my own problems, unlike some around here.
what kind of problems, sir?
I don't talk to cops, especially skinny bitch cops.
Hey, you watch the way you speak to my partner.
I was referring to you.
now, get off my property, or my lawyer will call your supervisor, and you'll both have a report in your personnel files.
I don't like being harassed by federal agents.
go.
scoot.
move.
Mike Hiller's got a driver's license and a checking account, but nothing else.
no birth certificate, no employment history.
it's like he never existed until six months ago.
Yeah, he's been through the legal system.
he knows the routine.
and how to push a cop's buttons.
this guy's got a record somewhere.
you think he'd be laying low, trying to mind his own business.
his type can't do that.
they're addicted to conflict.
they need to be aggressive and threatening.
guys like Hiller only get worse until they're finally caught.
Hey, guys, techs found this on the tape from a gas station security cam.
it's Mazzolla's car.
it's parked 50 feet from the place where Don's gun was stashed, two days ago.
Mazzolla lied.
he's got Don's gun.
and he's gonna use it on his neighbor.
you can't do this.
you don't have any evidence.
it's called probable cause.
your car was videotaped at a drop site for the gun.
there is no gun.
look, just calm down.
it's better if you tell us.
this is ridiculous.
look all you want.
I don't have it.
go ahead, tear the place apart.
the money I get from suing the FBI will pay for a great renovation!
Oh, damn.
what is it? It's not him. He doesn't have it.
finally, a cop when you need one.
enjoy juvie, kid.
Jim, what are you doing?
stopping him.
not like this, kid. You can't do it like this.
I have to before you take away the gun.
you think this guy is gonna hurt your family.
we know that. - Until we stop him.
and if you shoot him, you're gonna ruin your life forever.
fine.
I want this punk arrested.
shut your mouth!
Jim, I'm just gonna talk to you for...
for a second here, okay?
I'm not gonna do anything.
I've been an FBI agent for 15 years.
I trained for stuff like this.
I can take that gun from you if I want.
I can trick you into giving it to me,
I can get inside your head, but I'm not gonna do any of that.
want to know why?
I know you don't want to shoot him. I know it.
you just want to scare him just like he did to your family, and...
and I understand, believe me.
protecting your family's the most important thing, but...
you got to give me that gun, Jim.
cause that's the best way to protect them now.
hell of a way to raise your son, Mazzolla.
assault with a deadly weapon.
he's gonna do time, and I'm gonna sue you for every nickel you got! And you, arrest that kid and get your lousy Feds...
Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
I didn't touch you.
get these cuffs off of me, or your career is over.
I don't think so.
no? What are you charging me with?
you've got nothing. You know what?
I just have a feeling I'll find something.
will you look at this.
you trying to take my job right out from under me?
what the hell!
you see, Hiller is really Michael Ray Simmons.
escapee from the Florida State Prison where he was doing a life sentence without parole for a double murder.
no way. I-I'm not that guy.
Liz found a fingerprint match, saw my name on his sheet, and here I am.
Oh, so he's one of yours?
I don't believe this.
Yeah, sucks to be you.
see you got your gun back.
good job, Eppes.
Oh, and tell that brother of yours I can't believe I wasn't invited to his wedding.
we pieced the chain together from James Mazzolla Jr. to the battered woman to Ralph Morris, community watch guy.
and we wound up with a fugitive on Ian Edgerton's list.
what are the odds?
guess we'd have to ask Charlie.
he'd say it was a coincidence.
Hey, so, Betancourt, you got a little extra time to help me out with a case I'm working on?
you looking for a rebound partner?
Yeah, maybe I am.
got a problem with that?
not at all, Idaho. Not at all.
great.
leave me to be the third wheel.
we could all be partners.
not officially, but, yeah, I get what you're saying.
David's taking the promotion, Charlie's moving to England.
guess it's just down to us, huh?
what do they always say in the movies?
if we all stick together, everything will be okay.
fine. As long as we stay away from hugging and high-fives.
you know I can't let you walk out of here without saying something, right?
and why is that?
losing your gun- it helped to, uh...
to capture a violent fugitive and saved a family.
three people still lost their lives, even if they weren't exactly innocent.
you don't think the good balances out the bad?
you can't know that.
Yeah, well, you got that part right.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I've worked with you for six years.
you know, and regardless of how many times you've questioned your decisions, or you've beat yourself up,
I know...
I know in my heart, in the end, Don Eppes is a force.
you are a weapon for what's right, what's good and what's true.
Thanks. Yeah.
you're gonna make yourself one hell of a good team leader down there in D. C.
you know what? I will.
I've been having a hard time saying good-bye.
my father and brother are probably pretty tired of hearing me tell them how much I love them.
no.
Hey, Larry, want to thank you for giving me the wisdom I needed to grow up. Oh.
and the frequent scientific beat-downs I needed to expand my thinking.
thank you so much for sharing your world with me.
you've taught me the power of courage and service.
and you saved my life a few times.
Amita, you and I got to share both worlds, and you married me.
anyway, thank you all so much.
hear! Cheers.
Congratulations. Cheers.
I might follow those very kind words with a very brief announcement.
you're not going back into space, are you?
no, but I am about to embark on a mission to redefine space.
the space I am referring to happens to be your garage.
while Charlie and I are in England, Larry is going to help Alan remodel the garage.
he's gonna do what now?
it needs a renovation.
Oh, yeah.
and as co-owner of this property,
I think it would be best redone as a guesthouse. Oh.
what about what the other co-owner thinks?
I imagine that he would think that if his father chooses to live in the new guesthouse, it would be a way for him to stay close, yet have his own space.
that's exactly what I was thinking.
what do you say?
I guess my first question is, um...
...What's the rent gonna be?
Congratulations.
Congratulations!
where are the plates? You got to get plates.
Hey.
Hey.
here's to lost things found.
to brides and grooms everywhere.
they made a brave move.
Yeah.
we all have to move on some time.
Mmm, well, sometimes it feels safer to stay where you are.
more to life than that, right?
Yeah.
you know I was offered that Special Agent in Charge gig.
think I'm gonna take it.
that's great.
I thought you were gonna quit.
it's what I do.
I'm good at it. Mm-hmm.
that's good.
you know, when I asked you to marry me, and you said no...
you were right.
I was trying to figure things out, and I really wanted you to decide for me.
I know what I want... more than ever.
I want you to marry you.
will you marry me?
Yes.
I can't believe that in 28 hours we're going to be living in a country with 50 hertz electrical current and public health care.
Yeah. It's easy to get hesick when you have a home like this.
I'm gonna finish packing.
okay. I'm just gonna miss... everything.
well, we're gonna miss you, too, Chuck.
I won't miss being called Chuck, but...
for the first time in a long time, it feels like things are really settled here.
well, I guess that makes it the best time to move on.
what are you drawing?
I thought I'd get a jump on the new project.
what have you got, the garage? Let me see that.
uh, guesthouse.
uh, we haven't decided on what the rent is yet.
I'll pay you with rib eyes every Friday night. DON: Yeah.
that sounds fair. You'll be eating them while I'm 7, 000 miles away.
Hey, I'm your representative. What do you got, like, a 50-inch plasma there?
you're turning my garage into a man cave.
I like it. Gonna have to come by once in a while.
Yeah, tell us something weon't know.
everything changes, everything's the same.
victim's michelle kim. She used tolook like that.
what's the deal? Why can't lapd handle this?
uh, she used to work forthe chinese consulate.
you know how those gs are, 15 minutes after theyfind out she's dead, they'll have herapartment cleared out.
what did she dofor the consulate? - Interpreter.
witnesses?
Yeah. It's a hit andrun.
some say tahoe, some say explorer.
no way to know for sure.
there's got to be at leasta dozen barsin the area.
figure a d-u-hits her, panics, takes off.
no skid marks.
Nope.
any damage to these cars? - No.
lucky drunk.
Yeah, tell her that.
you know, they say there's nothing sexier than a man who know show to cook.
well, what do you say, you agree?
I don't know. I like guys who aregood amath.
well, actually I'm usingdifferential geometryto perfectthe chocate chip cookie.
that's right.
or is this in case thewhole math genius thingdoesn't work out?
it's for senior ditch day.
hmm. You mean senior beach day.
Yeah, when they're away, the underclassmen ll play. Remember, last year, they ransacked my office.
Yeah, so this year...
this year, I leave a peaceoffering for the hungry natives.
hmm, needs bigger chips.
so, I guess congratulationsare in order.
for?
it's a bit controversial, but I like it.
I mean, larry used anon-standard analysisinstead of the conventional borel approachin treating the singularities.
can I... just...
so Larry published an article...
on zero point energy and quan...
and quantum cosmology.
you didn't know?
well, I thoughthe would haveasked you to collaborate.
me, too.
coroner found paint chipsunder her skin. Color traces bkto the ford motor company.
they have a model yet?
either exploreror a jaguar. Better notify the locals.
if that suv was stolen, it's gonna be headed straightto a chop shop.
looks like michelle kim movedback and forthetween hereand china growing up.
we got a file on her?
Yeah, this is granger, fbi, for jackson.
no, but we have on her father.
okay, just have him come returnit, thank you.
former chinese diplomat. Retired in '97.
FBI counter intelligenceran a background checkon her when she moved backinto the country in '03.
Counr intelligence? Why were they looking at her?
I don't know.
whoa, whoa, wait a second. Scroll back down there.
right there. That background checkwas filed by an old army buddyof mine.
Dwayne carter. - Yeah.
Carter and I did a tourtogether in afghanistan.
you guys still tight?
I've called him a few times, but he hast been around.
the guy saved my ass.
Noay. - Yeah, we were in this humveetogether, got hit by an rpg and the thingjust exploded into flames.
I got trapped, had this piece of metaljust wrapped around my arm.
thought for suremy ticket was punched.
the man, he just...
jumped in, man, ripped me out of thereand the dumb bastard, he gotthird-degree burns on his hand.
sounds like the guy to talk to.
Hey, what are youdoing here?
Oh, I'm just gatheringsome information for a paperthat larry'sworking on.
Hey, you know, you guyshave direct accessthrough nasa's firell.
that's right. Big brother's always watching.
Hey, is this the new case?
Yeah, it's a hit and run, but I don't know,
I'm thinking this islooking like something more.
something morelike what?
well, like it's intentional.
okay, you nt meto take a look at it?
no, it's all right, don't worry about it. - Because, you know, I-I...
I can factor in steadymotion regimes
you know, body stiffnesscoefficients, and not to mention, you know, subtlebody undationsgenerated by theground-reaction force.
you got me there. Go for it.
because, you know, was shewalking, was she standing still?
I don't know. - How fastwas she moving?
once you havethat data, these impact marks can tell youa whole lot.
this is no problemfor me to work... - knock yourself out.
I'll have an answer for youas soon as I can. - You're the one who's alwayssaying you're overworked hey. H'd it goat kim's place?
I spoke to a coupleof the neighbors.
she was quiet, kept toherself, no boyfriend.
what, you don't buy it?
she's 24 years old.
her last stop was one ofthe hottest nightclubs in L. A.
I have my doubts.
bartender remembers r gettinga call right before she left.
Oh, yeah? Did it trace anywhere? - Didn'T.
call camefrom a prepaid cell phone.
techs just lifted kim's onlinebank account records.
got over a hundred grandin all-cash deposits.
well, the chinese pay theirinterpreters really well.
got untraceable cell phones, cash deposits.
what was this girl into?
since when is the fbi interested in zero point energy?
huh?
are you checking larry's work, charlie?
I'm just looking-- just taking a look at it.
did he ask you to do that? - No, no.
what he's done is fairly impressive.
Oh,"fairly impressive."
well, you knowhat I mean.
no. What do you mean?
nothing. It has, it has great potential.
Yeah, but it needs your assistance.
to be honest with you...
Yeah. Yes.
Charlie, did you ever think that maybe larry doesn't want you...
why wouldn't larry want my help?
I don't know, but he sure didn't ask for it, did he?
PFC granger, you son of a gun!
man. - What's up?
I practically had to put you under surveillance to find you.
Yeah, if I was easy to locate, I wouldn't be in counter intelligence now, would I?
what's up?
well, I caught this case-- michelle kim-- worked for the chinese.
Yeah, they said somebody was coming up to talk toe, so I took a look at my report-- wasn't much.
any reason you guys we looking into her to begin with?
immigration flagged her. She entered the country with two passports, parents both chinese nationals.
post 9-11. Thought was, we had to know wh she'd been up to on the mainland.
And?
she'd been in beijing at university;
she came back to take a job with thehinese consulate as an interpreter.
everhing seemed on the up and up.
Why? You got somethg different?
she died last night.
died? - Yeah.
hit and run. Maybe more. That's why I want to ta to you.
Yeah, I don't know.
uh, I'll ask around. See what I can dig up.
okay.
how you doing?
adjusting. You?
Yeah, the same, I guess.
Yeah, never really goes away, does it?
no, never does.
al right, you catch something, give me a call, all right?
Absolutely.
come here! Come here!
it's great to see you. - U, too.
Ah, charles.
say, did you know that an oort cloud has mass somewhere betweefive and a hundred times that of the earth?
oort cloud? Cloud that spits out comets?
Oh, yeah. Thousands of comets.
you know, I had, I had no idea.
Yeah.
so, I've, uh, come by here to congratulate you on your paper.
well, that was nothing.
nothing. Well, what you did, analyzing the effective weight of zero point energy in a nonstandard way, well, that-that could lead to a solution for the cosmological constant problem, right?
Yeah. Well, I mean, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics does say that there must be some virtual mass, so...
I'm sorry, I'm running late here. - Oh, I'm, I'm curious.
um, who collaborated wityou on the math?
Oh, stromsborg's good. - Yeah, he is. He is good.
Yeah, he's good.
uh, now, I'm sensing that there might be something more involved here than wl wishes.
Oh...
did you forget where my office was?
No! No!
stromsborg has so much experience in this field.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Yeah, but...
I'm so used to you coming to see me.
perhaps I was getting a little too used to it myself.
well, larry, you know, I he I've never made you feel like...
ohabsolutely not.
no, I just, I feel of late just a need to do some branching out, that's all.
branching out?
Yeah, well, I'm maybe like a comet trying to break out of its orbit, uh...
find my own escape trajectory, just come into my own entity, I don't know.
I'm so sorry, I'm running late, but, charles,
I think I just need to stretch myself a little, that's all.
pure and simple.
I've been cleared by my ambassador to cooperate in any way.
I've also notified miss kim's parents in beijing.
you can imagine how difficult a call that was to make.
I hope you expressed our sympathies.
to have a child taken from you at such great distance...
but I suppose a traffic accident can occuanywhere in the world.
well, we're not so sure it was an accident.
I don't understand.
well, her job was an interpreter? - That's right.
any reason she'd have large sums of cash in her bank account?
her personal finances wouldn't be something I would have any knowledge about.
so that would be a "no"?
I'm afraid I didn't really know h very well.
ll, we'd like to take a look at a list of people she worked with.
I'll speak with the ambassador, see what I can do.
Thanks. - Appreciate that.
What'd the consulate general have to say?
that he knew her less and less as we stoodhere.
well, either he's telling the truth or the chinese have a very liberal hiring policy.
Why?
credit card has a bunch of charges to nightspots, lingerie boutiques and the occasional adult store.
which totally contradicts what the neighbors told me.
maybe you should run those through lapd vice, narco...
you know, we'reot even sure this girl was actually murdered yet.
um, yeah, actually, we are, as promised,
I do have an answer on whether or not this was anccident.
I thought you had class.
I do. I have lunch and I...
look, you gu got, like, sandwiches around here?
we'll order out for you. - A nice turkey thing...?
what do you got?
all right, I tried using a steady-motion algorithm to try to determine the motion of your victim at the point of impact, but my results were inconusive.
but you persevered. - I did, I did.
you know, I imined her walking, the motion of her feet, and then it occurred to me
curtate cycloid.
Oh, curtate cycloid.
C. C. - Right, of course.
think of someone's, uh, someone's stride like the moon orbiting around the earth.
as the moon moves around the earth and the earth moves around the sun, the moon traces out a curtate cycloid curve in space.
in essence, creating a circle within a bigger circle.
now, when you walk, the heel orbiting backward then forward past the knee, creates the same pattern of circles.
now, from there, I could probabilistically determine the leg motion of your victim at the point of impact.
and that probabilistically helps us how?
well, the marks on her legs that the vehicle's lights made, - they're high. - High?
Yeah, the bumper of the vehicle was rising on impact.
so what, you're saying it wasccelerating?
which means this wasn't an accident.
Oh, no.
whatcha say, megan?
morning.
so, washington wants us to ndle this on a local level.
XXXXXXXXX - How are we doing on that girl's acunt?
not very good.
all the deposits were made in cash just below the ten grand reporting minimum.
yeah? What about colby's friend?
uh, dwayne carter said that kim's background check was just routine.
a 24-year-old interpreter with that ki of money ain't routine.
ERT found this access card during a daylight sweep of the cme scene.
kim's prints are all over it and it does not belong to the consulate.
or her apartment. I used a key found in her purse when i went the other night.
we got ert running it down right now.
Hey, you guys should have a look at this.
techs found something interesting on michelle's laptop.
Megan said you guys got something.
Hey. Yeah.
Michelle kim's computer.
seems like she had a thing for internet porn sites.
um, did she save any of the images from thiweb site?
Oh, yeah, she's downloaded quite a few images.
Why? What?
remember that image of the little girl we found hidden in the photograph?
right, the child porn case. - This is very similar.
it's only a lot more sophisticated.
this picture is really tusands of pixels reproduced as squares.
now could you ease zoom in on this portion of the photograph?
okay.
that's good.
all right, now remove some of these squares d you can still see the photo.
howver, a coded message can easily be hidden within this missing information.
Yeah, and?
well, you know those tests they give people for colorblindness, a green dots?
to someone who's truly colorblind, all they see is a bunch of green dots, but to a person with perfect vision, the same exact image reveals a hidden picre.
so you think you can crack it?
uh, look, if there's a message in here, yeah, then I should be able to find it.
Yeah, it's a pass card for the ilding garage.
something happen?
you recognize this girl?
15-C.
she had an apartment here?
Yeah. Had?
what's going on here?
she was killed in an accident.
Oh, wow.
that's horrible. - You know how long she lived here?
two years, give or take.
she live alone or with someone?
uh, alone, I think.
I'd see her come in maybe one, two nights a week.
you guys keep the tapes to that camera?
it's all digital.
the footage gets online to a database somewhere for insurance or something.
so, kim maintained a second apartment?
Yeah, under an alias. We checked it out.
there's no food the fridge, no cable hookups.
what do you think? A meeting place?
the lobby has security cameras. Colby's checking out the footage right now.
you know, what amazes me here is that they're hiding their messages using the very same encryption programs that the privacy groups hired us to develop.
back when I was real little, I heard thathe kgb and the cia used to send these encoded messages via shortwave radio.
I thought I was thonly one. - Oh, no, you and me both.
Yeah, I'd be listening to these people talking in these languages I couldn't possibly understand.
I was imagining their operatives in paris and germany.
I even tried sending my own secret messages in response.
I never thought about doing that.
well, the police came to my house. - The police came?
Yeah, it was some fcviolation. I think they were police.
you know, that reminds me of that time that we rewired the P. A. System at princeton.
listen, I have to say it was rreshing to see your sense of humor that time.
it really S. Up till then, I was a little concerned that your natural intensity might well be your undoing.
it wasn't just about IQs.
our working together?
no, no, no.
I knew your sense of analysis suited my own.
you're making it sound like, like that's changed.
Charles, let's face it. Your passion has taken you down many new roads:
your work with don, your convergence theory...
my program's got something here.
Hey, look in the eyebrow.
I think those are numbers.
my algorithm was able to find an image embedded in, in this region here.
I e-mailed a jpeg to your techs.
they stripped away the extraneous squares, whicthen revealed a series of letters and numbers.
two letters an nine digits; can't be a phone number.
but it could be an international banking number.
it's definitely an offshore account.
cyprus. Check it out.
first two letters: C-y, that's the country code.
now, this next file is very interesting.
this is one that kim posted of herself.
I gave it to your guys to isolate, as well.
it looks like a chinese character.
Yeah. - Enhance that? Enhance that?
okay.
two names.
Terry evans," uh, and "richard freeman."
she file-shared the photograph from a chat room, but you know there's no way to trace who might he downloaded it, so...
evans and freeman were federal witnesses scheduled to testify against a guy named jason ming until they were murdered
double tap. That's center mass. This is not just a murder, it's a hit.
ming was arrested four months ago for selling laser gyroscopes to north korea for a chinese contact.
so the next time the north kores fire a missile, maybe it hits north america and not the ocean.
ming posted a $3 million bail.
a week later the two witnesses against him were dead.
you know, these two witnesses' names were in a sealed indictment.
that's a papefile.
so someone physically had to get that info and give it to kim.
only people with access to a sealed indictment are federal prosecutors.
and federal agents.
which means there's a mole in the department of justice, and if the chinese have someone in the DOJ...
then they can get to any witness they want...
any case they want.
Hey.
man, granger, you scared the crap out of me.
Michelle kim-- the last time you saw her was two years ago?
I already told you that.
Yeah, tell me again.
it's boot camp.
they train you to put your shades on your back when you're approaching a target.
I guess old habits die hard.
I could bust your ass right now for lying to me!
she approached me after I did the background check, and we ended up sleeping together.
but thats it.
then why didn't you just tell me that fr the get-go?
why do you think I didn't tell you? I work counterintelligence.
I'm supposed to be following people like ki you're telling me that you knew she was a spy?
I had a pretty good idea, yeah.
how about an idea about killing witnesses who were going to testify against a fugitive on the U. S. Marshal's ten most wanted list?
think I had something too with that? - What do you want me to think?!
after I got back from Afghanistan, things with nny and me went south quick.
I ended up living in a small apartment with some judge telling me when I could see my son.
after I interviewed michelle, she called me, and we met up a couple of times.
she showed me some attention, you know?
I knew better, but I went for it.
but that was all it was.
so when-when was the last time that you actually saw her?
not the night she was killed.
look, a-any of this becomes issue, I will come clean-- you have my word.
you'd be baked inside a humvee if it wasn't for me.
you really think I'd screw you now?
you know, the number of espionage cases that we've prosecuted in the past decade has increased...
300%.
spies, huh? Is that what you're working on?
Yep.
Hey, did you know that nobody ever heard of james bond until president kennedy confessed that he had read the ian fleming novels before going to bed?
did you know that?
what, you don't believe it?
well, this is more than fiction. Hey...
you ever have a problem with...
someone that you respected at work?
why, you having troubles at work?
Larry. - Larry?
he published his latest paper.
he didn't ask me to coaborate.
well, I mean, with his experience, what hase got to do, check with you?
well, okay, that's not the point. - Well, what is the point?
that his paper is good. It could be great.
with your help, huh?
well...
you know, there was a time at work, I was at the city planning office.
my, uh, my boshad a design, and, um,
I don't know, I thought I saw something.
I mean, the plan was fine as it was, but
I thought that, um, I had seen something...
that I could make better.
What'd you do?
nothing.
because I had to decide which was re important, my relationship with my boss or with our client.
why don't you ask yourself this:
are you really ready to tell larry that his work is good but just not good enough?
any luck finding more cameras in kim's building?
no, these were the only ones, here in the lobby.
couldnt really tell which apartment the guests were going up to, and so far kim's always been alone.
you know, um...
that might not be true.
What'up, charlie? What are you doing here?
well, I'm just... working on something for larry.
look, you said that the footage from these cameras is archived, right?
Yeah, that's right. - Okay, well, then, look, if the apartment is a meeting place, then chances are your mole has been there more than once.
Yeah, but, mean, there are months of footage and hundreds of guests.
okay, but we know when kim was there, right? - Yeah, but so?
so I can run a series of eigenfaces.
Eigenfaces advanced facial-recognition techniques.
I've beeworking on a program that matches human asymmetry.
so I can create an algorithm that matches all visitors to the apartment at the times that we know that kim was there.
asymmetry points? Come on, charlie, help us out here, man.
no human face is perfectly symmetrica let's say that each little square of a rubik's cube represents a symmetry point
nose, ear or eye.
when the right combination is found, an individual symmetry point or body part is matched.
Hey, I just heard from the lapd there's a chop shop in van nuys that has an suv that matches the one that hit our girl.
what's up? - Help you with something?
Yeah. You tyler? - Yeah.
I want to get some rims.
what size? - 22'S.
how many you need? - Four of them would be great.
four rims. Means we've got four guys to deal with.
nice and chromed, if you can swing it.
chrome. Somebody's got a gun.
all right, let's go call it a thousand even.
FBI! You! Down!
Hey! You with the gun! Put it down!
Hey! Put t gun on the floor!
Hey! Don't! He dies, you die!
Oh, no, no! Here's how it goes!
I get out of here, or you both die!
David, shoot this dude.
will you just shoot him?! - Shut up!
drop him now! - Shut up! Shut up!
easy! Sy. Think.
think about it
there's no way out of here. You got no options. Put it down.
I mean it. David, shoot...
U okay?
Yeah. Told you already, I'm fine.
that was a close call earlier, man.
comes with the territory, right?
just saying, an, that's not like you to not bring your "a" game, brother.
a guy gets a jump on me, and suddenly I'm losing it?
I'm just saying, man.
last couple of days you been kind of quiet.
I'm your partner, man-- if there's something on your mind, just let me know, okay?
look, david, I appreciate what you did in there, all right?
but I am fine.
see you tomorrow.
okay.
Hey, I got it. - Got what?
I-I got an idea on your mole.
that asymmetry model really paid off.
check this out.
this is your most likely suspect.
the past three months, kim was at her apartment 24 times
eight ofhose times this guy shows up within an hour.
you sure about tt?
Yeah, I mean, I'm very sure. Once I established this image,
I cross-referenced it with the photo I. D. Database at the department ofustice.
Oh... that's dwayne carter.
isn't that, like, colby's army buddy in counterintelligence?
it's not like; it is.
Hey. Where is he?
he's on his way in.
what are you gonna do?
I don't know yet.
what, you got something you want to say?
don, if colby withheld something, I'm sure he had a good reason for it.
where are we on the warrant for carter's place?
the attorney general approved that this morning.
all right, wl, as soon as they let us know he's out, we're going in.
sure you want to wait? We have enou to bring him in right now.
that's homeland's call
they want to find out more about the setup, see if there's any connection to the consulate.
well, so far the cash withdrawals from kim's bank account correspond to a bunch of deposits that carter made, but we haven't had any luck tracing kim's source.
just keep digging.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
uh, yeah, you got that right.
all right, straight up, I want to know if you knew it was carter on that tape.
I had a feeling, yeah.
you had a feeling, and you don't bring it to me?
don, the guy's a friend of mine. He made a mistake.
it had nothing to do with the case.
your friend is bought and paid for by the chineseovernment.
I had no idea.
any money exchange hands between u two?
you lied to me-- I'm not exactly clear on the reason now.
I would never tank an investigation, don. You know that.
well, you crossed the line here.
what, and you haven't?
excuse me?
when megan was kidnapped-- you know what I'm talking about.
Yeah. To save a life?
Yeah, I was trying to save a buddy's career from going down the drain.
look, dwayne admitted to me that he was sleeping with kim, but he swore to me that it had nothing to do with our case.
he swore to you. Look, you're off the case.
XXXXXXXXXX biceps look pretty good. He should be in there a while.
now that you're done staring, we might be able to g the job done.
bathroom.
clear.
I got a laptop in here.
hey...
they look like brothers there, don't they?
Yeah.
xxxxxxxx
damn it, he's getting out already.
no, no, I need more time. - How about 45 seconds?
wasn't it 46?
44. Come on.
I'm coming.
come on.
Yeah, I'm coming.
Hey, is-is charlesere?
uh, no.
good. That's good.
that's very good.
can I get you something?
Hey, look at this.
why, to graduate princeton at 16!
I was good, but...
it took me till the more normal age of 19.
Ah, well, in that first year, we heard an awful lot about professor fleinhardt.
Yeah.
you know, he spent half the time trying to prove the T. A.'S thesis was wrong.
well, charlie was never afraid to give his opinion.
Yeah, well, of course, charles was right.
is there something bothering you, larry?
Charles is having trouble understanding why
I didn't ask for his help on this recent paper that I published.
Oh? - Yeah.
I mean, it's not that I don't value his input. I mean, yoknow that I do.
But?
Alan, charles's work at the FBI increasingly consumes him.
Yeah, we know that, but...
in my field, dependence on any one person, at can spell the end of a career.
and I'm just not ready to go.
not yet.
you know, there's also something called pride, and I've never found that a great justification for anything.
that w sog.
bank manager inadvertently tipped carter off that subpoenas are being served on his accounts.
well, is that your way of saying he'gone?
Yeah, he knows we're on to him.
all right, if carter's on the run, then he has access to all kinds of fake ids, passports.
Yeah, but we have his money. - Just let me ask you this:
you think he's the type of guy who's gonna hang around for like one last score?
I'd buy that. He probably has the name of every fbi informant working against the chinese.
we have the consulate covered, so there's no way he's gonna make contact there.
I mean, it could be pre-arranged, right? Look, he's meeting her on a regular basis.
Yeah, but that was at the apartment.
Yeah, but at some point, his handlers got twant to meet him, they got to want to check him out.
and there's no way she's gonna bring them all to that apartment.
you know, carter's pda had a bunch of meetings on company time that the bureau couldn't explain.
Yeah, you got the times?
they're all like 11: 00 to 1: 00.
well, you have, uh, the locations of the meets here?
they're spread throughout the city.
you knowhat, do me a favor, e-mail them to charlie, maybe he can come up with something.
we're worried that carter's going to try and sell wtever information he's got before he leaves the country.
and these appointments from carter's pda are meetings between him and the chinese?
we think so.
well, a lot of these aresses are within a couple miles of the fbi.
now I've learned frothe nsa that operatives will often schedule meeting places, like, monthsn advance.
they're given a list. And no two meeting places are ever the same.
okay, so we can then logically assume that the meeting place is somewhere inside this circle?
right.
it's a classic combinatorial optimization problem.
d no one is better at combinatorics than you.
who else could be?
it's simply a question of branching and bounding.
branching and bounding?
so you're trying to predict how a tree is going to branch.
and you know where six of the branches' meeting places already are.
now where will that seventbranch-- carter's next meeting place-- be?
certain factors can help us eliminate potential branches.
like, we know that carter has to make a clean and fast getaway.
see, these meetings are taking place in areas that are zoned for businesses with open courtyards, with promenades, with multiple entrances and exits.
one was pershing square...
and one was the staples center. They're both close to the freeway, easy getaways.
right, and so, by running an algorithm that analyzes the features of the existing meeting places to find key variables, then by applying a branching and bounding algorithm, we can hopefully identify where carter's next meeting place will be.
okay, thank you.
Sinclair for eppes. - Go for eppes.
SoG's got nothing on the other locations charlie's list.
all right, just give it time, you know?
I thout carter took all of his meetings during the daytime.
that's why it's called probability.
wait, hold on.
Yeah, I got eyes on him.
Hey, that's chen the guy from the consulate.
I don't know, he looks pretty calm. I don't think he knows we're on him.
don, carter just passed him something.
all right, let's follow him. Don't bumperock.
Bravo team take chen outside the park. We got carter.
XXXXXXXXX
Xxxxxxxxxxx
all right, he's turning right onto broadY.
stay back, everybody. Wait for me, wait for me.
copy that, david? - Copy that.
all right, wait. Hes going eastbound into the second strt tunnel.
David, let's box him in.
nclair to adam 23.
I want you to lock up the east end of the second street tunnel.
ut it down right now.
get your hands out of the windows!
get your hands out of the windows now!
driver, keep your hands out of the window, open the door and step toward my voice.
nice and easy. Just step toward my voice.
Dwayne, you don't want us pulling u out of that car.
XXXXXXX, Don't shoot.
come on. David.
come on.
you've got to be kidding me.
Colby was right, this guy is good.
here, catch.
unbelievable
chen isn't talking to anyone, and the state department's certainly not going to lean on him.
they've got bigger stakes with china.
we've got surveillance on the airports, public and private.
border patrol has a copy of carter's profile.
guy works in intelligence ten years, he's not taking public transportation.
don, if carter has an exit plan, colby is our best chance at figuring it out.
Yeah, ll, colby's not on the case. I mean, I can't trust him.
whatever happened between him and carter blurred his judgment.
why don't you let david try and call him?
I alreadtried. Got his voicemail.
guy's got something to say to me, he knows where I am.
guess you got toeep the boat in the divorce settlement.
do me a favor and untie that bow line.
R a guy who loves the ocean, I never could understand why you chose to go to the desert.
if I hadn't, you'd be dead.
they took my badge, my gun.
then there's nothing keeping you here, right?
look, I got something to sell that'd be enough for the both of us.
Yeah, and how many people are gonna die this time?
you killed two innocent witnesses.
and michelle kim?
when met her, I must've looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
I mean, this girl, she was all over me.
at first, it was just drinks and sex.
Yeah, and then what?
I was only giving her useless information. And every dimef it went to my kid.
no, the information you sold her killed two federal witnesses.
a murderer went free because of it.
she blackmailed me.
she told me if I didn't steal high-level information, she would expose me.
so, what, you killed her to save your ass?
I saved your ass once.
you remember?
at help am I to my son if I'm in prison?
there was nothing I could do.
I didn't have any other choice.
you got a choice now.
you can come in with me.
it's not gonna make anything right, but it might jusgive your kid one chance at least to forgive his father.
what if I don't? Huh?
you were one of the bravest soldiers I ever knew, dwayne.
No!
come on, give me the tape. Give me the tape.
you gonna kill me?
go ahead, man. Go ahead.
put down!
drop that gun! XXXXXXXXX
I can't believe you did this to me!
drop that gun! - Put it down!
drop it!
no. No, dwayne...
no, you did it to yourself.
XXXXXXXXXX Drop that gun! Put it down!
nds up! Now!
hands up!
you know, I've never been in combat.
but I've been in my share of fire fights and you know what scares the he out of me?
it's not dying.
It'letting my guys down.
you know? Losing trust.
you do it again, you're going to jail.
still trying to untie yourself.
ere's over 70 precise moves with this.
well, they don't call it the world's toughest brain teaser f nothing.
you know, I used to able to do these in under two minutes. W, it's over six.
Oh, that's still prettyood.
Yeah. It's not my best.
neither was hiring stromsborg as my collaborator.
Larry, we've discussed this, stromsborg's good.
Yeah, t he's not the best.
what I fort to keep in mind was the paper meant nothing.
you see, it was all about the work.
or should've bee speaking of work,
I could still use your help... if it's not too te.
I have a confession to make.
yeah?
I already read the paper.
Oh. And?
you want me to be honest with you? - No, I don't.
I want to remain a blithering idiot. Yes, of course, I want your honesty.
I never want to lose you as a friend.
and you never shall.
your paper...
it's a work of genius.
okay, now there. Was that so hard?
but... - but...
it would have benefited from the work of two geniuses.
Yeah. Simon and garfunkel, perhaps?
okay. Fine, yes.
as long as I'm simon.
well, charles, ever the pragmatist.
last night at 02: 00 we had an assault.
the killer: shaved head, six-five, six-six, shamrock tat on the throat.
I had him. I was in some hole-in-the-wall bar the other night. I froze.
yo, this our block. You can't tell us nothing,'cause we didn't do nothing.
officer, he didn't mean no disrespect.
my name is Michelle Terry. I'm Terry's sister.
Terry, what are you doing?
who you here with? - Nobody.
who wrote on that tombstone, nobody?
is he still running with that gang?
you told me you were out. - I am out.
then what were you doing tagging at a cemetery?
she hates me.
did you tell her you arrested him to save him from a felony?
maybe it's not hate.
no, that's hate. - God, I dig her.
all right, day tour, fall in for inspection.
McLaren. Con.- Here.- Here.
post 46. Martini.
Hey, Ray. Good morning. - Good morning.
let's roll.
Toney. Perry.- Here.- Here.
45. Harper. Sanchez.- Here.- Here.
who's that? - My dad.
post 47. Duke. McCormack.
Hey, Inspector.
what brings you uptown?
detective squad review.
22's clearance rate's a little low, Chief says.
wants me to give every open case, and detective, a thorough going-over. Oh.
something tells me it's not gonna be as romantic as it sounds.
Where's your flashlight?
you know, day tour. - And your vest?
soon as I lose this next ten pounds, sir.
I don't care if you're two tons of cop in a one-ton vest-- wear it.
how's Junior doing?
what, Kenny? He's, uh... he's a chip off the old McLaren block.
ride his tail.
no special favors, or I'll ride yours.
10-4, Inspector.
anybody got an extra flashlight?
dad. Hey.
I was hoping I'd catch your tour.
this is my partner, Ahmad Khan.
deputy Inspector Dennis McLaren.
pleasure to meet you. - Pleasure's mine.
so, did you hear your brother's getting his gold shield?
he made detective?
no, nobody told me. That's great.
Yeah, your mother wanted to be the one to tell you, but, uh, she left you a couple of messages.
I've been meaning to call back. - Listen, I got to, uh, be upstairs.
I got a major case review.
but, uh, call me when you go to meal. All right? I'll buy.
and shine up those dogs before you hit the street, will you?
my dad's a hard-ass, too.
when I was ten, I asked him why I had to be Muslim.
he slapped me so hard, I flew across the room.
told me to read the Koran.
I did. But I also read the Bible.
so Islam was my choice, not my father's or my grandfather's or his grandfather's.
the McLarens only have one religion: NYPD.
and our priest would agree.
my dad... you know, he's great.
generous, never missed a ball game.
he just wants the best for everyone in our family
so long as he gets to decide what that is.
22, Post 46, 10-11 silent alarm activation.
possible 10-30 at Mendenhall Bank, 3910...
show 46 responding. - Show 45 responding.
show 47 responding.
he's got a gun! Look out, he's got a gun!
police! Don't move!
relax, okay? - Sir, get out of the way.
nobody's going to get shot. - What are you doing?
okay, sir, please... - Come on! Come on!
what do you think you're doing? - There are more cops out there.
are you all right? - I'm fine.
hold the scene!
let's go around.
we got this side. You guys go.
cut through here.
this way.
I feel like a cat in an old cartoon waiting outside a moe hole.
there he is!
post 47 in pursuit on West 121st and A. C. Powell!
we had eyes on him, and then... Our luck.
a bank robber who leaps tall buildings in a single bound.
one question: Robber have a gun?
Yes. - Good.
FBI's case.
we just warm the sheets till they show up.
Hey, where you want to have lunch?
that little strip club under the bridge-- best meatballs in the city.
Mr. Arnhauldt?
you sure you're not injured? - No, I'm fine.
he threw you down pretty hard. - I'm fine.
listen, are we gonna be here much longer?
because I run a nursing home, and we're getting audited by the state today, and I'm gonna have 67 bewildered elderly people getting poked and prodded and...
generally have the breakfast scared out of them.
and where's the nursing home located? - Just around the corner...
he handed me the note and a backpack.
but you tripped the alarm anyway?
and I took my time with the cash, hoping the cops would get here in time.
they were fabulous.
fabulous is a big part of our training.
so he didn't get any cash, huh?
no. That man in the suit jumped in front of him, and the robber used him like a shield to get outside.
okay. Thanks. - You're welcome.
so, this witness, guy in the suit, tried to play hero.
Yeah, we talked to him. - Talked to him?
where is he?
he works near here. We'll go pick him up.
okay.
detective Luster, you wanted to see us?
we were first on the scene.
geez, I can't get away from McLarens today.
is this your first bank robbery?
hell of a start, huh?
who is it that, uh, your dad used to tell arrested Willie Sutton?
was that your grandfather?
great-grandfather.
need you to look at this.
male Hispanic.
five eight, buck-fifty, goatee.
that's only what, like, a million guys in New York?
did you get a look at him without the glasses?
scar, tattoo? Anything?
afraid not. - No, sorry.
well, he didn't get anything, so he'll probably try it again.
we had a guy last year hit a bank, walked across the street, hit another one.
we caught him trying a third. Asked him why.
he said,"Well, the first two went well-- I figured I was having a good day.
well, we'll keep an eye out for him. - Remember, he's got a gun.
you okay?
Yeah. Let's go. I'm good.
you've been kind of out of it since before roll call.
out of it? What, are you kidding?
I just chased a bank robber halfway across Harlem.
you telling me your heart's not thumping a little harder?
you stay out too late, Ray.
what am I supposed to do? I mean, come on.
aren't you keyed up after tour
I can't... I can't go home and just watch TV or whatever.
if you got the secret to chill at will, you know, you let me know.
Arnhauldt's not gonna be happy with us showing up during his audit. Yeah.
get off me! Let go! Get...
Hey, hey! You! Get against the wall!
Hey, you okay?
what's going on? - It's nothing, nothing.
it's a misunderstanding.
well, we can understand it at the precinct.
the robbery closed my branch.
I had to go use another one.
he probably saw the teller counting out my cash.
it was a fair amount.
how much is a "fair amount"?
five thousand.
my wife is a little neurotic, so... after the hurricane and then the earthquake, she heard on the news that you should have a month's expenses in cash on hand just in case of an emergency.
that's kind of ironic, you preparing for an emergency and getting mugged in the process.
Yeah, listen, I-I don't have time to press charges.
I got to get back to work.
I'm gonna need you to wait for a minute.
assault, assault, petty larceny, felony assault.
what, are you homesick for Riker's, Terrance?
it's all in the past, man. I don't do that no more.
you don't? You were jacking the guy.
I wasn't jacking the guy.
he was trying to give me five K.
he wanted me to kill somebody.
a total stranger offers you $5, 000 to kill somebody?
anybody in particular? - Never got around to telling me.
okay, so how did that turn into a fight?
man, I ain't no hit man.
but you show me an inch of money... Human nature shouldn't be a crime.
Oh, now you're making me sleepy.
gonna get some coffee, for the two of us.
Thanks.
10-13, 123rd and 5th!
come on, stay down, down!
Johnny, I told you not to come back!
stay down, give me your hands! Give me your hands!
come on, let's go!
Hey, you know who this is?
shannon Bar murder poster-- stomped some guy to death.
we got him? - No, I got him.
let's go.
let's go, Shamrock, come on.
Hey, you okay? I'll call EMS. - No, no.
my collar-- I'm coming with him.
homicide suspect John Kelso.
from the Shannon Bar stomping.
nice pinch, Harper.
d-cell One.
presidential Suite.
Harper, just so you know, the detective squad is going to get the collar, but you will get credit for the apprehension.
credit-- wow, a five-percent tip. That's very generous.
but Ray took him down.
well, blame 50 years of NYPD tradition.
after EMS checks you out, get me your report and then stick around.
want you to help out with the lineup.
what?
the way he keeps staring at me.
I mean, it's bad enough if he thinks I'm just some cop who arrested him, but what if he recognizes me from the bar and tells the other detectives that I choked, just let him walk away?
he's a murderer-- who's going to believe him?
okay, so they don't.
then what? Then I'm living with a lie.
I just-- I can't, I can't do it.
you think you haven't been?
look, rookies are on a two-year probation period.
he's a homicide suspect.
I could lose my job for failing to take police action.
well, we both could 'cause I've been keeping your secret, too.
look, Kelso has laid eyes on a lot of people since the murder.
you're just another ugly face in the crowd.
we released Arnhauldt, but thinking about how agitated and emotional he was...
I'd be agitated and emotional, too, if I went from being in a bank robbery to getting mugged.
or if you were a straight-up citizen trying to hire a hit man off the street.
come on.
I mugged him because he wanted me to kill somebody" is right next to "He mugged me, and I was trying to get my money back.
we charge Wilson with the robbery and be done with it.
maybe Detective Luster was right.
we take the robbery-assault collar and call it a day.
I'm not saying Terrance Wilson was telling the truth about murder for hire, but there's definitely something off about Arnhauldt.
here it is.
disorderly conduct about a month ago.
complainant's a woman named Joy Peoples, age 30.
incident in her apartment on 138th Street.
and there's about half a dozen parking tickets on that same block going back over two years.
Arnhauldt lives in Queens.
his nursing home's about a mile south of 138th, so what's he doing up there in Joy Peoples' apartment?
she's his side piece.
she's half his age.
what, you wouldn't go for a guy twice your age? - Not if he was married.
Oh, yeah, right, your "alleged" fiance
I mean, he's a rule maker, not rule breaker.
he's an ADA-- that's a rule enforcer.
I mean, he does exist, right?
because you don't show pictures, he never comes by.
I'm just saying, I think you made him up so people don't hit on you.
just you.
joy Peoples called the cops because Arnhauldt got rough.
you think maybe he was trying to hire somebody to finish the job?
you want to take it to Luster?
after the way he patted us on the head the last time?
let's talk to his side piece first.
won't be a huge party.
Eddie only made detective, not chief.
keg, couple handles in the rec room.
usual eats, usual crowd.
you stay over.
your mother keeps your room same as when you left it.
I thought she was gonna turn it into a study for herself.
eh, think she's waiting till you get a wife.
you know, she gets worried when she calls and all she gets is your voice mail.
you know, I'm sorry, it's just, these first couple months
it's like one tour starts before the last one ended.
so it's not because you're out every night with this girl
the one with the brother in the gang?
what, you mean Michelle?
I arrested her little brother for tagging.
listen to me.
her banger brother shoots somebody while you and her are going at it--are you kidding me?
that kid is not a banger, and I'm not even going out with her.
I haven't.
good.
is this why you came today-- to tell me all this?
my job is a lot bigger than monitoring your love life.
well, that's a relief.
that's what you call postmortem bruising.
that's from the aggressive application of your foot on his neck on the sidewalk outside the Shannon Bar.
I never been to New York until today.
and you got your girlfriend-- who's never been out of the city--pregnant how?
or maybe it's not your kid.
it's okay.
I don't need you to talk.
no deals to be made here.
but getting that big, stupid tattoo on your neck wasn't too brightful.
it helped eyewitnesses describe you and confirm sightings of you in town the day after
multiple sightings.
what was that about?
he was just asking me if we got hurt in the fight.
that's all?
you're saying I'm lying to you?
I, I don't know what you're doing.
ray, you better get a grip.
remember that this is on both of us?
Oh, yeah.
you put me in this position and you're not making it better by accusing me of doing things I didn't do.
you still mad at me?
actually, I-I owe you an apology, but I didn't know how to make it.
t told me what you really did-- arresting him for graffiti so he didn't get caught up in guns and burglary.
I haven't seen him hanging with a gang since the charges were dropped.
I wanted to call and-and say thank you, but I didn't know if it'd be right.
call me anytime you want.
Thanks. And you, too.
Dennis McLaren. - Michelle, my dad.
so, you're Michelle.
Kenny's told me a lot about you, but I didn't believe a word of it.
nice to meet you. - And you.
I'm giving Kenny a ride back to his post.
I'm gonna walk it.
it's just a couple blocks. Oh.
can I give you a ride?
uh, thanks, but I've got more errands.
well, then, good to see you, kiddo.
don't forget to call your mother.
geoff was just here.
did he hurt you? - Of course not.
wait. You mean, last month? That was a mistake.
geoff said he was gonna break up with me after eight years, and I...
he broke up with you because he's married?
that's what he said.
and I feel bad for her, but Geoff and me, we just can't live without each other.
he came back the very next night and every day since, and it's been wonderful.
you don't look like everything's wonderful.
you want to tell us what happened?
he was, like, in a hurry.
and he said,"Always remember I loved you.
and then,"Good-bye.
it was the "Always remember," it was so final.
and then I looked out the window, and there was this guy with a shaved head waiting for him.
and he put his arm around Geoff's shoulders, and they walked off together, but not like friends.
more like... I've got a very bad feeling.
bank robbery's going down, and Arnhauldt throws himself in the line of fire.
Wilson says he's walking around with five grand, trying to hire a hit man off the street.
Yeah, Wilson says.
he leaves his girlfriend and walks off with some scary guy.
what if he's trying to get himself killed?
over a girlfriend?
you want out, you don't want to hurt anybody.
you're unstable, wearing your emotions on your fingernails.
I think we got to find Arnhauldt before he and this scary guy get down to business.
okay, where do you want to start?
available units respond.
22, Post 45, we're right around the corner.
show us responding.
police! Police! I saw it! I saw it!
I saw everything. - Saw what?
I come out to do my bad habit, and I hear shouting, like two men's fighting, and then a gun goes off.
a white man runs up out of that stairwell and down the boulevard.
then a brother comes out like he's looking for the white guy, but he don't see him, and he runs off the other direction.
which one got shot? - No, I don't know.
which one had the gun?
I don't know. It could have been either one.
sounds like Arnhauldt. - Couldn't have gone far.
Thanks. - Thank you.
there. There he is.
unstable man in a crowded subway, possibly armed.
central, show 45 going to the hole at 135 on the One.
there he is.
Mr. Arnhauldt.
are you injured?
I'm okay, I'm fine.
we spoke to Joy.
Oh, God.
eyewitnesses from the Shannon Bar are here.
we should get Kelso in the lineup.
here, put this over his tattoo.
Mascis doesn't want the I. D. to look rigged.
fillers are wearing them, too.
all right, Curly, show time. Get up.
hold still. Got to cover up your beauty mark.
don't think I don't remember you.
turn around.
pick a number.
he remembers.
I'm screwed.
Hey, boss.
Hey. I heard the, uh, lineup was a home run.
Yeah, well, you know, it's hard to forget a face like that.
something else?
Yeah, um... Uh, do...?
I, uh... I saw that face before... myself.
at a bar... in the bathroom.
I went in, and, uh... he-he was there.
when?
night after the murder.
what did you do?
I had my gun.
but I was, um... I don't know, you know, I just-just fr... I just froze.
I was a little drunk, okay?
I mean, it's not okay, but I was.
and, you know, I should've called it in.
I know, I mean, that's the least I should've done, but I-I...
I didn't, and now this guy recognizes me... and he says he's gonna tell.
and you're just telling me about this now?
who else was in the bathroom with you?
nobody. Look, you want me to resign, I'll-I'll do it, okay?
I screwed up. - Shut up.
let me wrap my head around this.
first off, you're not resigning.
against all my expectations you're actually turning out to be a decent cop.
okay?
say nothing to anyone.
stay away from Kelso.
let's see how this plays out.
what if he says something?
then we'll deal with that. Now, get the hell away from me.
the first time Joy came to visit her grandmother at the home there was something there.
I know it sounds ridiculous with the age difference.
she's so beautiful.
we both felt it.
we'd sit together long after visiting hours just... talking about everything.
or nothing.
and one night I kissed her.
and she kissed back.
I was done for.
when her grandmother died, I paid for the funeral.
but I had been paying for the rent and bills and vacations.
we saw the photos.
I ran through every dime I ever saved.
and now I'm broke.
my wife doesn't know yet.
26 years we've been together.
I got two kids... that I love more than life itself.
and so you ask why, why would I do this.
but I can't live without Joy... and it's tearing me apart.
and I only saw one way out, so... you know, I had to make things right.
you couldn't kill yourself because your life insurance wouldn't pay out to your family, so you had to hire somebody to do it for you.
and when that bank robber didn't shoot you, you tried Wilson.
but he just tried to keep the cash.
I come out of the restaurant, and totally by accident,
Michelle comes walking down the sidewalk.
you really think she didn't know you were there?
never occurred to me.
and I'm the one who doesn't understand women?
there was a spark, a definite spark, and then Dad killed it, which wasn't an accident.
you know, wherever you want it to go with Michelle, it's your choice, not his.
easy to say.
same guy who got away this morning.
coming out of another bank?
stop! Police!
show 46 in pursuit!
10-85 bank robbery suspect in bridal shop, 131 and Morningside. Send backup.
everybody stand back.
Where's the guy who just ran in here?
nobody saw anything?
I told him no dye pack!
you've been robbing banks with a harmonica?
after you arrest him, Wilson, I knew, did a lot of time.
I looked all over Harlem.
finally I found this guy, Sammy Lane, who I had fired six months earlier for drugs.
bumped into him on Malcolm X.
the funny thing is, when I was... you know, when it was gonna happen, okay,
I'm looking down at the gun... I didn't want to die.
I told him, no, I... I changed my mind.
but he knew I had the cash.
sir... you're shot.
I'm okay.
I don't know, but I was pushing him away, and... he pulled the trigger.
why didn't you just give him the money?
I borrowed it on the last good credit card I had.
I had nothing left.
I just want to go home.
I just want to go home, I want to tell my wife everything-- everything-- I just want to...
I'm tired of lying, and...
somebody pulled the emergency brake.
hell of a coincidence.
ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing a momentary delay. Please be patient.
we'll be moving shortly.
going back to check on the brakes.
Arnhauldt... what's this Sammy look like?
he's a black guy. He's bald.
he's got a leather jacket, and, like, he's got scar behind his ear.
he's coming this way.
I think he's the one that pulled the brake.
must've seen Arnhauldt get on the train.
and not us. - Officer?
yeah?
he's got my gun.
he wants to finish the job.
22, requesting backup. Do you copy?
22? - Won't work down here.
and we're not on Transit's frequency.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay, yeah.
I think the bleeding just stopped.
sit tight.
everybody, I want you to just stay in your seats, remain calm, don't try and exit the car.
we're gonna try and get it moving as soon as possible.
Hey, hey, that's...
down! Down!
give me your gun! Give me your gun!
on the ground now! Get on the ground!
release the gun! Release the gun!
turn around! - Let go of the gun!
release the gun!
got it!
turn around. Turn around! Cuffs!
what's going on here?
emergency's over.
radio for a police car and an ambulance to meet us at the next station.
you just had your last subway ride for a long time.
come here. Get up.
nice look.
dye pack.
thanks to him.
enrique Garcia.
bank robbery, attempted bank robbery, resisting arrest, felony assault.
nice collar. Good work.
Oh, hey, boss, this stuff washes off, right?
no.
officers, Miss Garcia here wants to talk to you two.
Why? Tell me why.
well, he robbed a bank and then tried to rob another one.
no, no. Why he does he do it?
why is he so stupid?
I could kill him.
this was my Quinceaera.
you know what that is?
it's when a girl turns 15, and her father gives her away to womanhood.
a big party, beautiful old-fashioned gowns and music.
it means so much to me, because that stupid man, my father...
he was never around when I was growing up, because he was in prison for bank robbery.
he gets out last month and wants to make it up to me.
pay for the gowns, a DJ, food, a limo.
and how? He robs a bank.
it's because I love you. - You know that's wrong.
you know that takes you away from our family.
so why does he keep doing it?
well, there was a guy named Willie Sutton.
and nobody understood why he kept robbing banks, because he'd often get caught.
and when they asked him why'd he keep doing it?
he said,"Because that's where the money is.
that doesn't explain crap.
I hope you rot in jail!
does everybody in your family know so much about Willie Sutton?
if I never hear that name again, it'll be too soon.
meet you at the house. Thanks.
geoff Arnhauldt... he's in the next car.
you know we might have to charge him with soliciting murder, and filing false police report.
poor guy needs a shrink more than a cell.
how far does he think he's gonna get?
he's wounded, and we know where he lives.
I, um... told Yoda.
you tell him that I knew?
no. No, no.
no, no. This is all on me.
look, uh... I'm really sorry.
keeping a secret, it just, uh... ...it just really eats you up, you know?
I know. Both of us.
so, um... tomorrow?
Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow.
Hey, Kelso.
I talked to your girlfriend.
she says that you stayed with her the night after the murder.
so?
so you say anything about any of my cops having seen you before, she's arrested for harboring a fugitive.
and your daughter gets taken by the ACS.
we understand each other?
Yeah. - Yeah, what?
we understand each other.
doesn't change a thing.
you know that your cop is a punk.
what I know is, my cop took you down today.
don't ever lie to me again. - I didn't.
the hell you didn't. - I never went out with Michelle.
anybody can see the two of you are a couple. - We're not.
I mean, I am attracted to her, but I'm not seeing her.
don't forget. You're a cop now.
now? The badge was engraved before the christening.
did I ever-- ever-- say, "Kenny, you have to be a cop" ?
did I ever say that I wouldn't be proud of you if you weren't a cop?
you didn't have to. - Did I ever say it?
did I ever tell you, "You don't have a choice" ?
did you ever tell me I did?
I became a cop because my father, my uncles, our grandfather, his brother...
they were great men.
and I wanted to be like them.
I was hoping that's why you did it, too.
Hey, did you hear I caught a bank robber today?
I'll let them know. Thanks.
that was 108 squad.
they're at your guy Arnhauldt's house.
went to pick him up, ended up arresting his wife instead.
his wife? - Yeah.
apparently he came home, told her he was having an affair, and she freaked.
killed him with a steak knife.
I spoke to Kelso.
I don't think he's gonna give you away.
thank you.
I don't want your thanks.
I want you to get it together.
so where are you going now? You going home?
you know, I have no idea why you wanted to become a rookie cop at this point in your life.
I don't know. You know, I guess I just felt like...
doesn't matter. What matters is that you see that you're about to lose it.
Sarge, I... look, I know.
I froze, but it was, I... - I'm not talking about Kelso.
chalk it up to a rookie mistake.
you have got a problem.
and you have to deal with it.
you know, it's such a cliche.
the old-timer with a bottle in his locker.
Sarge, I don't have a bottle in my locker.
well, you haven't been around long enough yet.
but you've seen the guys that have.
and I saw how they got there.
find a meeting.
make this morning the last time you show up for roll call with a headache.
it's Officer McLaren.
I was just... enjoying having the place to myself.
uh... where's T?
up with his cousin in Brooklyn for the night.
what happened to you?
Oh. It's, uh... bank robber.
dye pack blew up.
this is a bad idea.
what happens to a dream deferred?
does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?
or fester like a sore and then run?
does it stink like rotten meat?
or crust and sugar over like a syrupy sweet?
maybe it sags like a heavy load.
or does it explode?
our next item: the "Stop the Violence Rally
at the Frederick Douglass Recreation Center.
this is an opportunity for the citizens of the 2-2
to make a statement about their neighborhood.
as a result, we get to show off our best and brightest.
rules out Martini and Moore. - Real funny, Harper, when you're opening in the Catskills.
Lazarus would like to work the rally.
says it'd mean the world to him; been dreaming about it since he was a little kid.
that a fact? - Well, absolutely, sir.
stale cotton candy, bouncy castles, long-winded speeches by local power brokers... My blue heaven.
good. You and McLaren have Post 78.
Perry, Sanchez, you get the TS.
what's the TS? - Telephone switchboard.
here's the drill:
public has access to every precinct's phone number.
a lot of times, civilians don't want to call 911.
they think if they call us direct, they'll get a quicker response time.
be polite, be professional.
officer Sanchez. - All emergency calls get rerouted to 911 dispatch.
ten-year-old boy wandering Riverside Park.
get a description.
ma'am, what does he look like?
missing kids - we handle immediately.
Caucasian, brown hair, blue eyes, hanging by the water.
thank you, ma'am. Can you hold?
this is a tour change.
the precincts are back logged, and all units are assigned.
I want you two to walk up to Riverside Park, and when you come back, I'll assign you to station house security.
go.
funny crime, doggy. Funny dog.
Hi. Thanks, guys.
keep playing with my hat, I'll have you neutered, man.
all right, that's fun...Oh, look, clever, right?
he boxes, too. Clever, that's very clever.
22 Adam, you have a 10-39 at 1346 West 129th Street.
neighbor says someone's lighting off fire crackers in an apartment.
what are you doing?
Hey! You want a shot at the real thing, guy?
post 78, we're down the block, responding.
come on, let's go. - You're dead.
Hey, sweetie.
what's your name? - Sean.
I'm Officer Sanchez; this is Officer Perry.
Hi.
what are you doing here all alone?
I'm drawing a ship.
that's really good. I like the smoke stacks.
it's the Titanic.
do you know it was 882 feet, nine inches in length, and on her way to New York when she sank?
you're very smart.
and you're pretty, like my mom.
do you know where your mom is, honey?
I'm not really sure, but she said if I ever got lost, I should come here.
is she in the park?
I don't think so.
do you know your phone number?
no, but I know where I live.
here.
it's you... watching the Titanic from shore.
all right, let's get you home.
those firecrackers have been going off for the past 20 minutes.
the place has been vacant for months.
Oh, I've seen a young man coming and going from that apartment.
personally, I think she sees things.
like I see you drinking that sweet wine poison when you're supposed to be mopping the foyer.
sounds like bacon burning.
smells like it, too.
sorry, I'm just used to going first. - Yeah, me, too. You go.
you two ever done this before?
first day working together. We're still ironing out the kinks.
looks like a one-man Woodstock in here.
there's gotta be $50 worth of cleaning supplies here, and the place is still a dump.
gunpowder. Washers, cut pieces of metal pipe...
looks like our squatter's been making a bomb.- Oh, man.
looks like it's all the same girl.
she must be the target.
Yeah, or maybe he wants to bomb the "Stop The Violence" rally.
unfortunately, today's rally is going to have to be cut short.
man, if you'd been doing your job better, we wouldn't need this rally;
now you're shutting it down? - Okay, look, look, we wouldn't be shutting down something this important if we didn't have a serious reason.
now, I'm going to need everybody to exit the building immediately in a calm and orderly manner.
these cleaning supplies were found in the suspect's apartment.
individually, the chemicals are harmless.
put together, you're looking at a deadly explosive better known as "Poor Man's C-4.
we could be looking at as much as eight or nine pounds, more than enough to take the entire building down.
once the place is evacuated, bomb squad will sweep the building while ESU assists.
based on a neighbor's description, we believe the suspect to be in his late teens, male, Hispanic.
no visible marks or tattoos.
excuse me. Sorry.
what are you doing?
what's in the backpack? - Nothing.
anything you want to confiscate? - No. Good luck.
we have no idea how this bomb is wired to be detonated, which means, the suspect could be in the crowd or close by.
looks like the Calvary's here.
hope I'm good enough to get on that squad one day.
is that how your old man made his bones? - No, detective squad.
cleared 20 homicides in a year at the seven-four. Still a record.
my uncle, he worked undercover in organized crime for two years, lead to 46 federal indictments.
that's hell of a family tree, man.
every McLaren makes his mark on the NYPD in a different way.
well, good to know you're not putting any pressure on yourself.
sorry, been a little crazy this morning.
now, which one of you two is least likely to crash a prisoner van?
I learned to drive in Kabul when I was 12 years old.
there weren't even traffic lights back then. I remember...
you drive. Transport van is sitting in front; take it around back.
you're making a prisoner run to the Tombs.
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
this is it!
what number building is this? - The sixth one.
you're going to get it right this time. I feel it.
six is my lucky number. Mark Sanchez wears it.
my favorite player for the New York Jets.
I know everything about him.
okay.
Hi, sir.
stay sharp.
any behavioral problems in one vehicle, handcuffs are more of a suggestion than a guarantee.
have a good trip.
Hey, blood, you got a smoke? - No, and how exactly am I your blood?
man, we all decedents of the same 12 tribes - me, you, him...
always talking loud and saying nothing.
maybe not him. He's still stuck in the pond.
let's go.
I looked all over for you.
Oh, thank God you're okay.
how many times have I told you, you don't leave this apartment building by yourself?
I'm sorry. - Ms...?
heartwood, Natalie. Thank you so much for bringing him home.
how long was he missing?
uh, not long. I went out looking for him right away.
well, next time you should call 911.
I know the number. Thanks.
I'm just saying missing children are a priority for us.
well, I'll keep that in mind. Where was he?
he was at Riverside Park at 112th, looking at the river.
said that's where you told him to meet you.
Sean, why don't you go play in your room for a minute, hm?
look, you probably never heard of this, but Sean suffers from PDD.
pervasive Developmental Disorder, high functioning autism.
it's very hard for him to differentiate between his imaginative and real life.
it's as if the two blend together.
you thought of putting an address card in his pocket, maybe a child proof lock on the door?
thank you for the parenting advice, but we already have one.
the delivery man came by earlier today, and the nanny must have forgotten to lock it.
well, thank you again, Officers.
Sean, thank the nice officers for bringing you home, hm?
I want to show them my room.
I'm sure they don't have time for that. The city needs them.
the city can wait.
please, folks, you have to move out of here.
can I go back in there right quick? I left my phone.
just as soon as we get the all-clear.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, if you're thinking there's no way that two women in America, let alone Harlem, have that exact same piercing under their eye and lip.
the photos from the bomber's apartment-that's the girl in the pictures.
you see her ID card? She's supposed to speak at the rally.
excuse me.
can I help you with something? - You can actually.
do you recognize this guy?
that hair, those crazy stalker eyes - it looks like J. J.
J. J. Got a last name? - Martinez.
he asked me out last month, but he's a creep.
he's been following me around, talks to himself behind my back.
I almost called the cops.
why are you looking for him? - We just want to talk.
any idea where we might find him?
I think he has a job during the day at the Temple Assembly Church on 123rd and Madison.
that's where we met anyhow.
Hey, did he do something wrong?
I mean, am I in danger? - No, not anymore.
show Post 78 at 123 and Madison for investigation.
...and this is my best friend.
had him since I was five.
what's his name? - Duck.
at least he can't forget it.
who's this?
that's my mommy.
I think it's time for the officers to go, sweetheart, and we have homework to do.
here. You keep it.
thank you.
his mommy?
I thought that look meant I go first.
we definitely got to work on this.
you want to go left or right? - Right.
now, that look means you go.
come any closer, and I will blow this whole damn block up.
I swear I will do it.
now put the guns away.
okay, take it easy, all right?
it's gone. I'm putting the gun away.
gun is away.
him, too.
do it.
now, how about you, you know... how about you give me the detonator?
Yeah, come on, man.
she has it coming to her.
no, no, nothing is worth this, all right?
take it from me.
you know, if I planted a bomb every time a girl broke my heart, all of Manhattan would have a view of the river.
you know, I was going to marry her.
central Park. - Yeah.
a honeymoon in Paris.
why is he looking at me like I'm crazy? - No, no, no.
Cupid hates him, too, right?
you kidding me?
there's this girl I like,
I see her every day walking our beat.
I can't even ask her out; I'm so worried what my father's gonna think.
it's never easy, right? - No, it's not.
look, man, you don't...
you don't want to hurt anybody.
come on.
I'm sorry...
think you should have stayed on 10th Avenue.
you grew up driving in a free-fire zone, and you're going to give me traffic tips?
watch them bumps, baby brother. - My sciatica is acting up.
my apologies.
Yeah, watch this bump.
what's happening? - The engine; we got no power.
everybody all right?
give me a couple of minutes; I'll let you know.
I'm hurt. I'm definitely hurt.
what's wrong?
so what now?
you threaten me until I tell you where the bomb is?
threaten? You've seen too many movies, kid.
tough guy like you, you're not gonna cave.
we found a lot of chemicals in your apartment.
how big are we talking? - Seven pounds.
homemade C-4, right?
HMTD caps. - Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine.
most powerful and unstable blasting caps they make.
I have a cousin who works in the bomb squad. - But of course.
it would really help us if you would just tell us that location.
you would really like that, wouldn't you?
well, I'll tell you what I'd like first.
you tell that ice queen bitch, to come here right now, or I don't talk.
you know if that bomb goes off, you're going to be charged as a domestic terrorist.
and then you're looking at the death penalty. Lethal injection.
they say that it's like going to sleep, but I've got a friend, he's a doctor.
he says it's more like being suffocated.
Hey, do you know that they make you wear a diaper?
Oh, God.
you're a smart kid; I'm sure you can figure out why.
you got about ten seconds before they take you away, and the next guy might not be as nice as me.
it's in a gray backpack near the stage.
central, 2-2 van 4-5-8-9, can you have a unit 85 me non-emergency at Lenox and 120th Street?
our van is disabled, and we're on a prisoner transport.
yo, pump the gas.
you'll flood the engine.
it's the spark plugs that got jarred loose. - Spark plugs?
what do you know, didn't even graduate the damn third grade.
just pump the gas like I said.
it's dead.
Hey, sometimes a good prayer to the man above will get you back.
are you a sinner, officer?
not like I'm about to be if you don't shut up.
be advised there's no units available.
you'll need to sit tight.
seriously, sit tight? That's the best they can come up with?
officer, I gots to go to the bathroom. - Go ahead.
J. J. says the device is in a gray backpack, west side of the stage.
it won't be enough to just find the bomb, we have to get the damn thing outside.
I think we got it.
Natalie Heartwood. Why are you running Sean's mom?
call came in for a dispute last year at her address.
domestic? - No, female breaking into the apartment.
neighbor called it in.
by the time the police responded, she was gone.
no name, just a description.
red hair, blue eyes.
sounds familiar?
there's another report, two months later.
neighbor spotted red hanging around Riverside Park.
could be random.
or maybe Sean just saw her and got an idea of somebody new to sketch.
the way the kid keeps disappearing all the time, he clearly has issues.
Sean said that if he was in trouble, he was supposed to meet his mom in Riverside Park by 112th Street, right?
Natalie looked for him everywhere, but she didn't know to look there?
she's lying. About something.
or maybe she just got under your skin.
we've got a police report of a stalker and a little boy drawing pictures of her.
I can just imagine what Yoda's going to say.
our probable cause is a crayon drawing from a ten-year-old boy?
and probable cause for what?
I don't know, but I want to find this woman and ask her what she was doing there.
be advised 2-2 van 4-5-8-9,
task Force assigned to respond. ETA two hours.
you got to be kidding me.
34, 000 cops, not one can drive over and bail us out any quicker?
Hey, Cagney and Lacey, we need a stretch back here.
I believe it was the Supreme Court itself that stated overcrowding and unsanitary conditions is a direct violation of our incarcerated rights.
and based on the big man's flatulence, my rights are being violated approximately every 30 seconds!
sit down, you fool.
Hey, break it up!
enough! Break it up! Break it up!
I hear so much as another word out of you two,
I'm exercising my constitutional right to kick both of y'all asses.
what, huh?
you got something to say?
you didn't have to do that. I had it handled.
no disrespect, but I grew up with punks like that.
only one language that they understand, and that's force.
look, it's possible the kid is just color-blind.
I got it.
22nd Precinct. Officer Perry, how may I help you?
red hair, blue eyes, bird tattoo.
seven years ago,
officers responded to a possible child endangerment at St. Luke's Hospital.
I'm not even going to bother asking the kid's name.
Dob puts him at ten years old this month.
amber currently resides in the far West 40's.
I guess I know where we're spending our lunch break.
all right, fire in the hole.
paper.
lipstick.
it's a science textbook.
the color was right on the backpack, the markings.
the kid told us exactly where to find it.
unless there's two backpacks.
you know, it's gray, nylon, zipper, pretty generic.
if Karima Harding had one that looked similar, she could have grabbed it by mistake in all the chaos.
right, so whoever this Ms. Harding is is walking around right now with a bag full of explosives that could go at any minute.
we are looking for Karima Harding, believed to be carrying a gray backpack filled with approximately seven pounds of explosives.
victim does not have a cell phone.
her mom confiscated it because she does not approve of her current boyfriend.
note photo number two - Drake Robinson.
runs with the Young Gun Goons in the Pierce Houses on East 119th.
Drake has a couple of collars - one aggravated assault against a police officer.
watch yourselves around this guy.
each of you will be assigned a location Karima is known to frequent.
amber Chasen, NYPD.
amber, wait.
FYI, we usually travel in twos.
I didn't do nothing.
if you didn't do anything, why did you run?
we're not taking you to jail.
this is about Sean, isn't it?
you even have a clue what you're doing?
one thing I'm not doing is consorting with the enemy.
they're human beings. They have to eat.
I hope you plus-sized mine 'cause I'm mad hungry.
listen up, I'm going to treat you with respect.
don't give me a reason to regret that decision.
I can't...
it's vegetarian.
next thing I know, you two will be planning a terrorist attack together.
you're not even worth my time.
what's that you say?
kill him!
come on, break it up!
now! Freedom!
seriously, are you kidding me?
a prison break with four guys daisy-chained to one another?
this is why you don't treat 'em with respect.
you sure Sean's okay? - He's fine.
we found him in Riverside Park.
he was looking for you, wasn't he?
I wasn't using when he was born.
it was a tough delivery, and they gave me painkillers afterwards.
I know it's hard for women like you to imagine being so weak.
I went back and forth between being clean and using.
we survived for a while on the streets, shelters...
but after a few years it just got too hard.
so you just decided to sell your son?
when Sean was three I was approached by this man in the park.
he said he'd give me $2, 000 cash if I gave him up.
said my boy would be loved and taken care of.
$2, 000 was only enough to keep me high for a week or two.
but I knew it was the best thing for Sean.
eventually Child Services was going to take him from me, or maybe something even worse was going to happen.
you went to see him last year.
I know it was a stupid thing to do - going up there.
I just wanted to see him, see how he'd grown.
afterwards I got a visit from that same guy.
he said he'd make sure I go back to jail forever if I ever go north of 100th Street again.
if what you're telling us is true, we can have him arrested.
it's what your partner said - I'm a junkie who sold her son.
they might take him away from Natalie Heartwood, but I know they'll never give him back to me, and I don't blame 'em.
I just want to see him...
talk to him.
Hey, have you guys seen this girl?
no?
do either of you know Karima Harding?
Hey, so that thing you said to J. J. in the church about that girl and your old man
that wasn't just a line of bull, was it?
was yours? - Think you know the answer to that.
Yeah, it sounds to me like, if you don't bring home the Medal of Valor, that you'll never live up to your pops.
the man casts a big shadow.
Hey, you know, I, uh, I knew this journalist once.
you know, he was hell-bent on, on winning a Pulitzer.
that's all he wanted. He signed up for every war zone on all five continents.
did he get it? - Yeah, posthumously.
I appreciate the cautionary tale, but it's easy for you to say.
you've been playing the hero since the day we got here.
already got your medal and press conference.
Yeah, well, I didn't ask for it, man, and I certainly didn't plan it that way.
think they were here to check out the latest Harry Potter?
Drake's not in this crew, but that ink on their necks looks like the Young Guns gang symbol.
well, let's take a closer look, huh?
all right, you guys know the drill - hands where we can see 'em.
why you porkies never say please?
YGG - Young Gun Goons.
what are you doing at the library? - What's the matter?
cause I'm YGG, mean I can't read?
Where's Drake? - Drake, who's Drake?
you just took a swing at a police officer.
now, I'm guessing you're on parole, so that is a "Don't pass go, don't collect $20" kind of violation.
tell us where he is and you live to fight another day.
offer expires in ten seconds.
he was at the library a while back.
he was heading towards 121st to go grab some food with his new biscuit.
that's all I know, man.
all right, you gentlemen enjoy your afternoon.
when I was little, my mom worked at this sweatshop.
one day she got her hand all chewed up in a sewing machine.
disability check would come, she'd cash it.
supposed to buy groceries that would last for a little while, but when the check came, somebody in our building tipped off guys in our neighborhood.
they'd rob her on the way to the store.
that's why you became a cop.
I became a cop 'cause I blew out my ACL.
you got a second chance.
don't you think they deserve one, too?
in my country you go to jail to be punished.
here it's in the hope of rehabilitation, - or so I've been told. - By who?
look, Ahmad, only thing perps learn when they go to jail is how to be better perps.
officer Sanchez, what a pleasant surprise.
I saw Amber Chasen earlier today.
she's clean and sober. Been for over a year.
do you even have an inkling what that woman is about?
I know she showed up at your door last year and you lied to the police.
sent some goon to scare her off so she doesn't see her little boy.
I was scared and I was trying to protect Sean.
she said you bought him for two grand.
a cotton swab and a DNA test,
child Services come, take Sean away, and I put you in jail.
a junkie can have babies like a toaster popping out toast, but someone like me, someone who really wants to give a child a proper home...
it doesn't work out that way.
he's not a commodity, and I know his mother doesn't meet your moral standards, - but she loves her son. - I am his mother.
you should have seen Sean when they brought him to me.
he was underweight, malnourished.
it was a miracle he was even alive.
he's got special needs.
can you imagine where he would be if we didn't raise him?
even Amber knew enough to give the boy up.
there's a bodega on Broadway and 114th Street.
we'll meet you there in an hour. - And?
and Amber Chasen gets to give her son an ice cream cone.
eleven o'clock.
wait, don't run!
you're not in trouble.
they headed east on 124th Street.
Drake can't go north of 125th Street.
YGG's at war with the Killer Klown Crew.
he must be heading into the park.
2-2 van 4-5-8-9 to Central, looking for an ETA on our task force.
be advised, notification has been made. ETA unknown.
I can fix it.
what the hell you know about fixing a car?
I can fix it, but you gotta take these cuffs off me.
ATV north on Mount Morris Park
victim and gray knapsack in sight.
pull over!
Hey, come on! Drake, you're not in trouble.
Hey, pull over!
central, be advised, suspect ATV is eastbound toward Madison.
have units respond to that side of the park.
we're on foot in pursuit.
units will be blocking all the exits.
ESU is sweeping southwest.
you guys canvass south toward 120th Street.
radio back if you see anything.
she'll be here. She said she'll be here.
I know you want to make things right, but we just don't always get to do that.
taking a child away, deciding who can be a mom and who can't, it's not fair.
Tonya, listen, Amber decided who could be a mom.
and I think she decided again today.
Hi, Officer Sanchez. - Hey, sweetie. Thank you for coming.
I just wanted to introduce you to a friend of mine.
where is she?
let's get some ice cream.
you like chocolate?
he's going to fix the engine.
and you believe him?
look, already had one jailbreak today.
don't need to see the sequel.
he didn't try anything. Just defended himself.
now, we've been here all day; I don't want to spend the night, too.
wait, you're not really gonna do this, are you?
come on, man, you proved your point.
she's not coming.
I could've told you that.
when I was a teenager, my mom and I, we used to fight.
just typical mother and daughter stuff.
one day, it was over this boy she wouldn't let me go out with, and I told her I hope she died.
didn't happen right away, but a couple months later, came home from school...
just by the way my brother looked at me, I knew.
then afterwards, I...
I used to think I saw her.
in crowds, across the street.
she'd just be standing there, just watching me.
for Sean, this is real.
his mother's really out there.
you gonna lie to him forever, hope he never finds out?
what happens when he does?
try it now.
you can take your hand off the gun.
if I wanted it, I would've taken it already.
so you helped us out today.
doesn't change what you did to get here.
manslaughter - that's just another word for murder.
it was self-defense.
judge told me, "You make me go to trial"and the jury don't like you,
I'm giving you the max.
plea out, and I'll sentence you to three years.
so I pled out.
in case you're wondering, I learned how to fix cars in the joint.
I ain't gonna be in there forever.
Karima! Come on, please stop!
we got a visual. They're heading into the amphitheatre.
Karima, you're not in trouble.
neither is Drake.
the backpack you're carrying, it isn't yours.
listen, this is gonna sound crazy, but listen to me very carefully, okay?
we just want to help you, okay? - I'm stuck.
you might have something very dangerous inside your backpack. All right?
somebody may have left some explosives in there.
very, very unstable explosives.
all right? So just-just let us help you, please.
Ah, damn. You're strapping a bomb, girl.
where are you going?
call me if you make it out.
wait, you got to help me get it off!
help! Please help! I'm stuck!
it's okay. It's gonna be okay. - help me.
help me! Help me!
please help! - We're here. We're here.
it's okay, it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
it's okay. You're gonna be okay.
believe it or not, when I was your age, I got myself in a similar situation.
Seriously? - Yeah, yeah.
I got my head stuck under the front seat of the family car;it was much worse than this.
I have a knapsack with a bomb in it!
no, my head was really stuck though.
I mean, I was - my father, my uncle, everybody yanking at me.
you know, it was humiliating.
you know, I felt like I was Winnie the Pooh.
but, look, here I am today, you know, so you're gonna be okay.
you're free. Come on.
carefully.
you hear that? - Yeah, and I smell it, too.
the magnesium started burning.
come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Quickly.
come on, quickly, let's go.
unbelievable.
six hours and we end right back up where we started.
see, that's the problem with this country. We're in a stalemate.
no forward progress.
you know, I think for once, he's actually making sense.
my back teeth is floating I got to use the bathroom so bad.
officer McLaren, can I get a picture, please?
you should really get one of me and my partner, Officer Harper.
already spoke to him. He said you were the one that did all the heavy lifting.
Thanks.
gonna be on the cover of the Post tomorrow. Congrats.
well, your pops will be pretty proud, huh?
you didn't even have to wind up in a hospital bed.
it's nice to know we finally got our timing down.
please, could you have cut any slower?
you're here to complain, I can go get my sergeant.
you know, I knew this day would come.
pretended it wouldn't, but I always knew.
it scared the hell out of me.
well, you're off the hook.
I passed by the halfway house, and manager said Amber split.
took all her stuff.
I guess she still couldn't deal with it.
but you were right.
it doesn't change anything.
sooner or later,
I'm going to have to tell Sean the truth.
anyhow Sean made another picture.
for Amber.
when you catch up to her.
what makes you so sure I'm going to do that?
I have a feeling.
call it mother's intuition.
Jack: Earth, before the war.
new York, before I was born.
a place I've only seen pictures of.
I know you...
but we've never met.
I'm with you...
but I don't know your name.
I know I'm dreaming. But it feels like more than that.
it feels like a memory.
how can that be?
march 14th, 2077.
five years since the mandatory memory wipe.
and I'm still haunted by these dreams.
victoria and I were assigned together.
in two weeks, our mission here will be finished, and we'll join the others.
but the questions I ask, she doesn't.
the things I wonder about, she won't.
it's been half a century since the scavengers destroyed our moon.
forced to leave their own dying planet, they came to take ours.
without the moon, the Earth was thrown into chaos.
earthquakes toppled cities within hours.
tsunamis wiped out what remained.
then came the invasion.
we did what we had to do.
we used the nukes.
we won the war, but lost the planet.
left it contaminated. Most of it uninhabitable.
what remained of humanity had to leave the Earth.
we built the Tet, our mission control.
a temporary space station before the migration to Titan Saturn's largest moon.
everyone's there now.
well, almost everyone.
until our tour is complete, Vika and I do our job.
we protect the hydro rigs which convert Earth's sea water into fusion energy for the new colony.
the survival of humanity depends on it.
thank you for the coffee.
remnants of the scavenger army continue to disrupt the operation.
they attack our drones at night and try to kill me during the day.
there's still fight in them, but I don't know why.
mission says we have done well.
that we are an effective team.
Vika's my communications officer.
she keeps an eye on me.
I handle drone maintenance.
the drones watch everything.
Vika can't wait to go. Me, I'm not so sure.
I can't shake the feeling that Earth in spite of all that's happened...
earth is still my home.
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
morning, Bob.
tower, comm check.
drone Maintenance Technician 49, hydro rig support.
all Bubbleship systems are green.
I'm good to go.
copy, Tech-49, you're cleared. Be careful out there.
always am. -No, you're not.
Yeah, you're right. I gotta work on that.
all right, Tet's coming online in 30 seconds.
relaying hydro rig coordinates now. Confirm visual.
I got 'em. Hydro rigs are sucking seawater.
you got 'em, Bob?
drone 185 looks good.
Jack, we've got two drones down.
shit.
stand by, Mission coming online.
and we have Tet contact.
morning, boss.
tower 49, this is Mission Control.
how y'all doing this lovely morning?
another day in paradise, Sally. Uploading data now.
49 mission log. Day 1642, hydro rig support.
I have two...-You have two drones offline.
perimeter's compromised.
copy that, relaying to Tech. Stand by.
Jack, 166 is down in Grid 37.
linking to beacon now.
you'll go there first.
got it. On my way.
victoria: Mission, Tech-49 is en route to Grid 37 now.
can you plug that hole with Drone 109?
negative, 109 is in the dock. Still waiting for parts.
Jack better find those drones and get 'em flying.
those rigs can't be exposed overnight.
copy that.
SALLY'. Tower, didn't he fix 166 recently?
Jack has fixed all the drones recently.
and, if we had the parts that we've been asking for we wouldn't be running a skeleton crew down here.
understood. We're doing the best we can.
are you an effective team?
we are an effective team.
your directive today is to rehabilitate 166 and find 172.
get 'em flying by sundown and I'll buy you two a round of drinks when you get up to the Tet.
you had better be ready, Sally.
two weeks now, we're keeping track.
okay.
come on, Bob. Work with me, here, buddy.
Tech-49?
Tech-49?
Jack?
copy, Tower.
what happened? I lost you for a second.
Really?
coming up on location.
there it is.
I've got multiple scav kills.
drone 166 put up a hell of a fight.
got any movement?
no sign of scavenger activity.
but I've got limited visibility, here, Jack, due to low angle of Mission.
copy that. I'm coming in hot.
starting repairs. Watch my back.
I always do.
you know, I read about this game.
it was played right here.
the last Super Bowl.
please don't tell me, it was a classic.
a classic game.
down by four.
the ball was on the 50-yard line.
seconds left on the clock.
the ball is snapped and the QB fumbles.
disaster.
looks like the game is over.
I'm reading the whole central core off-alignment.
you don't have the necessary tools down there.
and a new fuel cell is not going to fix that.
but this QB runs back, and picks up his own fumble.
hold on, what did you just do?
there's a wall of linebackers closing in on him.
so, he throws a long ball with no idea who is at the other end.
a Hail Mary.
Eighty-thousand people on their feet watching this ball sail through the air.
downfield is a rookie wide receiver, third string.
he just leaps out of the pack.
Touchdown!
contact! West contact!
Jack?
it's okay, Vika.
it's just a dog.
Hey.
now, go on. You gotta get out of here.
go on, get!
get out of here! Go!
Tech-49, Jack Harper.
you're welcome.
166 is back online.
two drones shot down today. Ten fuel cells stolen in just over a month.
these scavs are getting bolder.
well, the hydro rigs are taking all the water.
once we're gone, they'll have nothing but dust and radiation.
this is bullshit.
we won the war.
now we have to leave.
two more weeks, Jack.
then we'll be on our way to Titan.
Yep.
that drone is out there somewhere.
we just have to find it.
without a beacon, that's like finding a needle in a haystack.
so we go to our ground game.
tower, I've located 172 down a sinkhole.
no visual, but I can hear it.
Tet's so far off angle, I can barely see you.
how's it look?
it's good, it's good. There's no sign of scav activity on top.
Tet's offline in 15 minutes.
after that, you're on your own.
mission, this is Tower 49.
Jack has located drone 172. Engaged in recovery now.
requesting backup to his location ASAP.
I've got a visual on Drone 172.
Jack?
what the hell?
shit.
Jack!
Tech-49, Jack Harper.
Jack Harper, Tech-49!
Hey!
Oh, no.
come on. Not my goddamn bike!
how can a man die better/ Than facing fearful odds.
for the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his Gods.
Jack?
Yep, I'll be right there.
how does 109 look?
can it fly?
barely.
and without armor, she's a sitting duck.
well, I'll talk to Sally about that shielding in the morning.
okay.
again.
what, Jack Harper?
where did you get this?
it was growing in...
come on, Jack, you know the regulations.
I know you think I'm a stickler but you have no idea what kind of toxins could be in something like that.
it's a flower, Vika.
Yeah, that's not the point.
it's that we are so close to the end and the last thing that we need is you putting it all at risk.
okay.
every day, you have to go down there and see what was lost.
but we've done our job, Jack.
it's time to go.
I don't think they were trying to kill me today.
the scavs.
they were trying to catch me.
well, they can't have you.
come on.
you should come with me sometime, before we leave.
there's a place I found I'd like to show you.
I'll show you something.
Hey, hey!
Oh, my God.
it was a six-stage meltdown from inside the hydro rig's core.
it's offline permanently.
Sally: Tower 49, you have put the whole operation at risk.
I need to know exactly what happened.
victoria: Jack believes the scavs weaponized one of the stolen fuel cells and got it into the suction.
tower, hold.
tower, I've got a rogue signal in Grid 37. Are you seeing this?
Yes.
it's gotta be scav.
it's not one of ours.
Jack, the signal is being directed off-planet.
on my Way
tower, our logs show you are missing an additional nine fuel cells.
can you confirm?
negative, Mission, that number is 10.
drone 172 was lost last night.
109 is combat-ready as soon as we get that shielding.
we can cover the remaining rigs with drones in the field.
I've run the numbers.
we'll do the numbers up here, Tower.
I'm tasking the drones to defensive positions.
our job is to run those rigs. Your directive is to protect them.
we cannot afford to lose another. Do you copy?
are you and Jack an effective team?
damn right we are.
Jack?
you're right on top of it. Do you have a visual?
Jack?
Yeah, I got it.
they have some kind of a repeater.
the scavs are using the building as an antenna.
can you decrypt?
it's a set of coordinates.
grid 17.
it's a goddamn homing beacon.
grid 17.
what the hell is out there?
nothing. It's the middle of nowhere.
what is going on?
why would the scavs send a signal off-planet, Jack?
I'm shutting it down.
Tech-49, check your course. You're headed right for the border.
that radiation will cook you from the inside before you know it.
it's okay, Vika. I see it.
I'm gonna do a perimeter check before I head home.
I may go off-comm.
Jack, we should keep in contact.
just let me know where you are.
do you COPY?
Jack, do you copy?
that's right, Bob.
you know where we're going.
are you gonna miss me?
I'm gonna miss this place.
it would have been great.
it would have been great.
Vika? Vika, did you get that?
Jack, where have you been?
an object came down in 17.
that's the beacon coordinates.
exactly.
I saw it. Some sort of vessel.
Jack, Mission's almost offline.
I'm en route now.
mission, we have an unidentified object impact in 17.
it came down at coordinates sent by a scav beacon.
my tech's en route now.
tower, we're going offline soon, but drones are already mobile and executing.
have your tech stand down.
Jack, Mission wants you to stand down. The drones will handle it.
Jack: That's a negative, Tower.
with Tet offline, we need our eyes on this.
I want to know this site is secure.
Sally, my tech's concerned about the security of the site.
tower, you have lost enough assets for today.
keep your tech out of there. Do you copy?
copy, Command, I'm...
Jack, Command wants you to stand down. The drones will handle this.
I'm on site.
Jack.
I don't have eyes on you. Command's offline.
Vika, I think it's one of ours.
this thing is ancient. It looks pre-war.
the scavs brought this thing down, Jack.
there's no sign of scavs.
technician, this is your Control.
I'm ordering you to pull out and return to the tower immediately.
touching down.
they're human.
tower, we have got survivors.
there are four...Check it, five survivors.
they are human.
stand down!
Vika, the drones are firing on survivors.
Jack, the Tet's offline. I don't have control.
stand down!
Jack Harper, Tech-49.
back off, you son of a bitch!
back off!
open the door.
Vika!
get the med kit.
get the med kit!
this has to be reported.
be sure and report that the drones killed the crew from one of our own ships.
see what Command makes of that.
it's breathing fluid. Just let her get it out.
Jack.
here. You're still dehydrated.
where are we?
I'm Victoria, this is Jack.
what's your name?
I'm Julia.
Julia...
I'm sorry for what I have to tell you but you were in a crash.
your ship came down.
Jack managed to pull you from the wreckage.
but none of your crew survived.
what do you mean?
you're the only one that made it.
I'm sorry.
you've been in delta sleep for a long time.
some disorientation is normal.
how long?
sixty years.
at least.
I have to get back to our ship.
it's too dangerous down there. You need to rest.
Vika...
don't touch me.
your ship's re-entry was triggered by a beacon from the surface.
do you know anything about that?
what was your mission?
it's classified.
well, we have no record of an Odyssey...
I can't tell you anything until I get the flight recorder from my ship.
Julia, a lot has changed in 60 years.
while you were in delta sleep earth was attacked.
call them scavs.
they destroyed our moon and with that, half the planet.
then they invaded.
we won the war but Earth was ruined.
everyone's on Titan now. It's a moon of Saturn.
or on the space station, getting ready to go.
we're here for security and drone maintenance.
we're the mop-up crew.
you've lost people.
everything.
if you want to be alone, we understand.
the drones killed her entire crew.
if I hadn't gotten there...
I want her gone first thing.
Vika...
do you have any memories before the mission?
before the security wipe?
our job is not to remember.
remember?
do you remember her?
Jack
that was a scav beacon that brought her down.
we don't know who she is.
or what she is.
let's just get through the night.
okay?
you fly that thing?
Yes.
what happens now?
the Tet will be online soon.
victoria will report your rescue.
they'll send someone down for you.
from the Tet?
Yes.
I need to get the flight recorder from my ship.
the scavs, they move at night.
they could be all over it by now.
I need to know what happened.
you need to know what happened.
please.
Jack?
Jack, what are you doing?
Vika, she's a flight officer.
she wants to see her ship and secure the flight recorder.
now, you would want the same thing.
Jack.
I can't protect you.
no, I understand.
this one's on me.
I couldn't save them.
Jack. Jack!
Jack, can you hear me?
all right, it's time to go.
Jack.
I found it.
Jack!
tower 49, how are y'all this lovely morning?
another day in paradise.
Sally...
Jack took a pre-dawn patrol and went off-comm near the canyons in 17.
now, I know we're low on drones but, um, requesting one to sweep the area.
just a quick scout.
copy 49, tasking 185 to Grid 22.
BEECH: "And how can a man die better Than facing fearful odds.
for the ashes of his fathers.
and the temples of his Gods
I've been watching you, Jack.
you're curious.
what are you looking for in those books?
do they bring back old memories?
you won't get anything from me.
my memory has been wiped to protect the security of the mission. Yes.
you can't have your precious memory falling into the wrong hands, now, can you?
tell me.
have you ever met a scav up close?
of course not. You just repair drones.
don't go into the radiation zone.
don't ask too many questions.
not part of the job description.
lights.
we're not alien, Jack.
we're human.
of course, for us, being human is a problem.
old stealth fighter tech. Shields us from your scanners.
vocal scrambling.
can you hear me, Jack?
keeps your drones confused.
well, most of the time.
the drones are programmed to kill humans, Jack.
you saw what they did to those sleep pods.
you almost got yourself blown to bits protecting that woman.
why did you do that?
anyone would have.
anyone.
interesting.
we're wasting our time.
the drone will track him here.
BEECH: That's Sergeant Sykes.
he thinks I'm a fool for having brought you here.
I hope you prove him wrong.
mission, I'm picking up a bio trail somewhere near the west canyons.
can you confirm the sequence?
stand by.
DNA confirmed. It's Jack.
Vika, are you okay?
everything good between you two?
of course.
you're still an effective team?
we're great.
never better.
BEECH: We were running a ground game, and losing.
so, we decided, "What the hell?
we've got to throw the long ball.
it took us decades just to crack the GPS codes.
that's how you brought down the Odyssey.
Why?
the Odyssey's compact reactor, courtesy of NASA.
very hard to come by.
did you like the show last night?
that was just one fuel cell.
imagine what 10 of them will do with a core of weapons-grade plutonium.
we have a nuke, and we have a drone to carry it.
but we can't access it. It doesn't know who we are.
but it knows you, Jack.
we need you to program the drone.
have it carry our nuke up to the Tet.
end this war.
there are people up there.
sergeant.
program the drone to return to the Tet.
it needs to go right to the center.
screw you.
we haven't got time for this.
Hey. Hey!
no.
let's go! Get him up.
mission, 185 just went off-grid.
copy, Tower, we're seeing the same thing.
permission to task two additional drones?
if one drone is here, more will come.
and they won't stop until they find me.
they'll turn this place to dust.
but if you let us go, I'll call them off.
it's your only chance.
I've been to your "radiation zones.
if you're looking for the truth that's where you'll find it.
you've risked all our lives. Everything.
what makes you think he's different?
she does.
mission, I've found my tech over in 37.
you can call off the search.
Sally: Copy that, Tower. Glad Jack's safe.
tasking the other drones back to rig support.
where are we going now?
who are you?
what aren't you telling me?
Jack
what were you doing on the Odyssey?
what was your mission?
it was a research flight to Titan. My first.
that's what it was supposed to be.
six weeks to launch, deep space scanners picked up an alien object.
we were reassigned to investigate.
they put us all in delta.
they must have woken you and Victoria first.
what?
that object was the Tet, Jack.
the Tet was our mission.
that's impossible.
that's impossible!
who are you?
I'm your wife.
I don't know what happened, but you're not who you think you are.
Jack, we were here.
you asked me to meet you, brought me up on top of the world.
I could tell you were nervous that day.
it was right here, Jack.
you said "Look through here,
and I'll show you the future.
and I held up a ring.
and you said...
Yes.
there you are.
there you are.
Hi.
hello.
come on.
Vika, I'm coming in.
do not report to Mission until I get back. Do you copy?
do you COPY?
Vika, open the door.
stay away from me.
I don't want to hear it.
it's not safe here, and we need to leave, now.
it was always her.
wasn't it?
Vika...
she's my wife.
mission, this is Tower 49.
Sally: Go ahead, 49.
no.
I'm having a problem with my technician.
no, you don't know what you're doing.
he found a survivor at the crash site.
you've gotta listen to me.
she's impeding his abilities and he is unfit for service.
no, no, no.
I'm sorry to hear that, Vika.
are you still an effective team?
Vika...
open the goddamn door, Vika!
no.
we are not an effective team.
Vika, please. We have to go now.
I'm not going anywhere with you, Jack.
there's a place I know. We'll be safe.
I'm going to Titan.
there is no Titan.
they lied to us.
just stay away from me.
Vika, please, there are things...
things you need to know.
I don't want to know!
Jack
Hi, Jack. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
what have you done?
you can't blame yourself for this. Drones are unreliable.
sometimes things go wrong.
go wrong"?
you killed her.
I know, it's tragic. She was a wonderful person.
Jack, we want to bring you in.
I've been authorized to tell you we're going to assign you a new mission.
you and the survivor.
there's a lot of interest up here. Bring her up.
we can debrief, then anything's possible.
it's time to come home, Jack.
Jack?
Jack?
Jack
I'm sorry.
hang on.
lightning.
that's the plan.
we need cover.
there.
are you okay? -No.
don't worry, we're staying out of there.
are we gonna die?
No!
maybe.
Jack!
son of a bitch.
wait here.
who is it?
Hey!
wait!
wait!
Hey!
drop your weapon!
it's okay.
don't move!
we have to shut that drone down.
stop moving!
Jack!
it's okay.
Julia.
Julia!
don't.
don't touch me.
hold on.
just hold on.
Jack Harper, Tech-52.
Hey.
there you are.
what happened? Are you okay?
that bogey came across the border and then I lost you.
false alarm.
I should get back out there.
you come all the way home, and I don't get a kiss?
what's going on up there?
I was thinking...
why don't you come down with me?
to the surface?
we could go right now.
now?
Yeah.
are you serious?
you won't believe what's down there.
Jack
you know the regulations.
Yes.
can we not do this again? I'm done talking about it.
okay.
this is gonna hurt.
hell of a day, huh, Bob?
you always loved this song.
I'm not him.
I know I'm not.
but I've loved you for as long as I can remember.
I don't know how else to say it.
you know what you said to me once?
you said when it was all over, you would build me a house on a lake.
we would grow old and fat together.
and we would fight.
maybe drink too much.
real romantic.
and then we would die and be buried in a meadow by the lake.
and the world would forget about us.
but we would always have each other.
I remember.
those memories are yours, Jack.
they're ours.
they are you.
good morning.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life here.
you still can.
I have to go.
those people need my help.
we'll come back when it's over.
promise me.
we'll come back when it's over.
you had me worried for a second.
I thought you weren't coming back.
well, I had to prove him wrong.
you look like shit.
you should see the other guy.
if I had told you what you'd find out there you would have thought I was crazy.
I still do.
Malcolm Beech.
Julia Harper.
come on.
mission, I'm picking up a bio-trail somewhere near the West Canyons.
can you confirm the sequence?
stand by.
DNA confirmed, it's Jack.
mission, 185 just went off-grid.
copy, Tower. We're seeing the same thing.
I'd been in the army less than a year when that unholy Tet arrived.
I saw the moon get taken out.
right up there in the night sky.
I couldn't believe it.
after that, nature took over.
there's bedrock around Chicago so we were spared the worst of the waves and the quakes.
most people just starved.
then the Tet sent troop ships down.
the doors opened and out you came.
astronaut Jack Harper.
thousands of you.
memory wiped.
programmed to kill.
they had taken one of our best and turned him against us.
no soul.
no humanity.
the Tet.
what a brilliant machine.
feeding off one planet after another for energy.
phase Two was drones.
repairmen.
50 years of watching those hydro rigs suck our planet dry.
then one day
I saw you set down.
another drone to fix.
but in the rubble that day was a book.
you picked it up.
you studied it.
and I thought I saw a way.
when you stepped in front of that drone and saved her
I knew.
you were in there somewhere.
I just had to find a way to bring you back.
watch it, watch it.
eyes on it. Steady.
give it some space.
come on, you're making it nervous.
that is one pissed-off weapon.
no, it's just a machine.
I'm the weapon.
I would love to be there to see that thing's face when this goes off.
that would be a one-way trip.
Yeah, but it would be worth it.
welcome back, Commander.
open the doors!
shit!
spread out!
head down, keep your head down!
Jack!
follow me!
come on, you son of a bitch!
Hey!
Jack.
I'm okay.
the drone.
send the drone.
it's gone.
I thought we had it.
I really did.
I can take the bomb myself.
Ah...
you know it will swat you like a fly.
not if I go.
no.
she asked you to bring me up.
so bring me up.
we'll go together.
it reminds me of home.
ready?
Jack.
dream of us.
Jack
automated VOICE: Flight recorder playback for the Odyssey mission.
3 May, 2017.
okay, Bob.
ready for space?
good morning, Odyssey, from your friends here at Mission Control.
good morning, Mission. This is Commander Jack Harper.
thank you for that fantastic wake-up call.
Pre-rendezvous checks complete.
electrical guidance and nav systems, all good.
range behind object, 250 clicks...
12 below V-bar, closure rate 200 kilometers per hour.
copy that. It's good to see you, Jack.
after 39 days of sleep, sounds like you're ready to go.
I'm ready to go.
your next burn will bring you up level and co-speed at 50 kilometer range, where you'll hold.
copy. We'll hold 50 clicks from object for sensor scan and evaluation.
targets look good.
initiating burn in 3, 2,1...
ignition.
we see a good burn.
are you reading any output from the object?
negative.
zero heat. No EMR.
there's no sign of life.
how is the rest of the crew doing?
co-pilot Victoria Olsen should be up here shortly.
the rest of the crew remains in delta sleep.
copy that.
you missed a hell of a game last night.
what did I tell you guys? No spoilers about last night's game.
I'm looking forward to watching it when I get back.
you're not talking about football already, are you?
good morning, Vika.
good morning, Sally.
how are you doing this lovely morning?
another day in paradise.
Hey.
one for history.
Yeah.
Tech-49, I have you on approach.
Hello, Sally.
it's a busy morning, huh?
I'm picking up a second passenger, Jack.
it's Julia Rusakova the female survivor from the crashed module.
state your intention.
deliver the survivor, as requested.
we are a more effective team.
proceed to entry.
mission, we have a situation.
the last burn was spot-on to give us a SO-click hold from object, but radar range still decreasing.
we're accelerating toward the object.
we're going to need full OMS burn to pull away.
initiate now. Entering target.
gimbals set. Target's good.
arm forward engines. Engines on.
ready? Let's go.
mission, we're in full OMS burn, trying to back out.
there's a lot of vibration.
we're not getting away from this thing.
odyssey, telemetry shows structural overstress.
knock off the burn. Do you copy?
cutting off burn.
mission.
mission? Mission?
Sally?
increased acceleration toward the object
estimated contact within two minutes.
I'm going to eject the sleep module.
it's programmed for reinsertion into Earth orbit.
I'll fly the Command module out if I break free.
I want you back there now.-Absolutely not.
that's an order!
Jack, no, we're a team.
we've got to go, Jack, 30 seconds!
dream of us.
Jack
Tech-49, enter at headway speed.
entering at headway.
you buck up, Bob.
don't go all shaky on me.
Jack, I can't help notice your respiration and heart rate have increased.
I'm just excited to finally meet you, Sally.
there's been a pattern of insubordinate behavior recently.
Yeah.
I feel bad about that.
voice analysis indicates you are lying to me, Jack.
tell me why you are here.
you have five seconds.
I want Julia to live.
I want our species to survive.
this is the only way.
proceed to landing. Atmosphere provided.
welcome home, Jack.
come on.
Jack, you're doing the right thing.
I don't know what you are, or where you're from but I'd like to tell you about something I read.
a story from Rome a city you destroyed.
it's a classic.
there was a guy, Horatius held the bridge alone against a whole army.
and what Horatius said was "How can a man die better...
you don't have to die, Jack. She doesn't have to die.
everybody dies, Sally.
the thing is, to die well.
Jack, that's not the survivor you promised me.
no, it's not.
what Horatius said was "How can a man die better/Than facing fearful odds
Drones! Get inside! Get inside!
for the ashes of his fathers.
and the temples of his Gods."
I created you, Jack.
I am your God.
fuck you, Sally.
earth, after the war.
three years have passed since I saw your face.
I wonder if I come to you at night, in dreams.
in the day, as memories.
do I haunt your hours the way you haunted mine?
and I wonder if you see me when you look at her.
mommy, look.
if we have souls, they are made of the love we share.
undimmed by time.
unbound by death.
for three years, I searched for the house he built.
I knew it had to be out there.
because I know him.
I am him.
who's that?
I am Jack Harper.
and I am home.
I wanna see you, Janet.
will you let me do that?
why don't you bring her?
afraid of getting teased?
maybe he just doesn't want to be seen with me.
Janet, don't go there.
I'm a teacher.
you're a student.
you wanna pump the brakes on us.
that is what I'm saying.
I haven't left this house in five years.
all that I want-- all that I have ever worked for is for us to one day be a family.
my mom broke up with big cat, so maybe now you and her could get together.
I want you guys in my life.
what it domes to-- we all fall in love sometimes.
looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day, doesn't it, boys?
Oh, that's quite a skip you got there, son.
Oh, that's not a skip.
that's a spring or a hop.
so what gives, twinkle toes?
well, I guess you could say it's the walk of a man that's finally found some clarity about what he wants out of life.
I mean, everything I could ever want is right here
my classes at the doof you know, teaching, being a role model, the whole "to sir, with love" thing.
the fellas, you guys...and if she signs off... Hannah.
Yeah.
well, you know what I want?
the newspaper.
think maybe you could go out there and fetch it for me?
you know, in some cultures, people are actually known to open the door, step outside and get the newspaper themselves.
Ah, I'm wearing my short robe.
I don't wanna give Mrs. Turner a thrill if I have to bend over to pick it up.
Aw, come on, dad.
Mrs. Turner hasn't had a thrill since reagan beat Mondale.
exactly. She's due.
Nicky, you should go get the paper.
trust me. You should.
okay.
but the mood I'm in, I might just flash Mrs. Turner for the hell of it.
I know it's early.
no, it's--it's great.
it's like finding one of those shampoo samples attached to the front page, only a thousand times better.
what's going on?
I've been up all night thinking...thinking about what you said before you went to new york to get owen.
And? - And...
ten years ago, I would have given anything to hear those words
that you missed me and you loved me and you wanted to be with me.
but, Nick, I can't build my life on the fantasy of what we were.
it's not a fantasy.
I'm not the same girl who went skinny-dipping in crystal lake in the middle of november.
and you're not the same guy who had to push that old truck up walnut hill to get me to the hospital before the hypothermia set in.
and we have nothing else to go on-- nothing but those memories, and you can't build a future on memories.
I just--I want you to give us a chance.
you know, to-- - Nick, don't.
please.
Sully's outdone himself this year.
backfield burgers," "pump fake fries.
homecoming weekend always inspires the man.
Hey, guys.
okay.
Ah, yes. The classic "how do we greet each other?
Kiss/handshake hello.
I don't know about you two, but it certainly made me uncomfortable.
heard it went well in the big apple.
Yeah, it was, uh...it wasn't easy prying Owen out of big boy Brett's clutches.
I can imagine.
so what'll it be to celebrate?
a cup of Sully's finest sludge?
with some milk and sugar to wash it down.
make it for the road?
sure.
how's he doing--Owen?
well, he's back in the house, but it's gotta be rough.
I can imagine.
still, it's gotta be some comfort knowing he's got a friend like you.
it good to be back.
it's good having you back.
so...
ready to start reliving the famed "hail eddie"?
don't you think people are sick of that by now?
I mean, it's been ten years.
are you kidding?
they're still talking about the time Larry bBird stopped at the cumberland farms to ask for directions.
1989。
bird was trying to get to the u2 concert in worcester.
he made a wrong turn off 128, stopped in for a map, a large ginger ale and two sticks o jbeeferky.
by the way, uh,"onside kick-ass fries" is not gonna fit on that board.
we gotta come up with a new name.
Yeah, what about, uh...
leave us alone burgers"?
I get it.
sorry.
on the house. - Keep the change.
I'll see ya later, Eddie.
fine.
I-I didn't mean to rattle you.
I'm not rattled.
a little rattled.
I know.
I should be in berkeley getting clear of you, and yet here you are.
here I am.
so a funny thing happened on the way to the airport.
I closed my eyes for a minute, and I saw it-- the end of my novel.
you wrote a novel?
an unfinished one-- unfinished for years
all journey and no destination.
you wrote a novel.
and thanks to you, I finished it.
because once I saw that elusive final moment,
I remembered what you said in class.
the muse is like a tornado--when it hits, hole up and don't come out till it's leveled the last trailer park of self-doubt.
I said that?
that's goofy.
so I had the cab take me to the closest airport hotel, and I've been writing for 48 hours straight.
well, I can't wait to read it.
it's not being published anytime soon.
no, I mean I'd love to reaowit n.
I could even share a few of my thoughts if you're interested.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
why not?
we're gonna be late for class. Come on.
well, it's the term "run-on" that gives these sentences a bad name, right?
I mean, they're just sentences trying to contain themselves, bursting with emotion.
ms. Diaz, how nice of you to join us.
well, hello, Professor Bow.
and look, you brought a friend.
uh, actually, this is my class you're teaching.
nicholson Garrett. - Yeah.
it's a pleasure.
duncan Bow, tremendous fan.
Oh, nice to meet you.
uh, dean etwood asked me to take the class.
take the class"?
you were gone for a few days.
she wasn't sure when you were... coming back.
Oh, well... I'm back now.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
um, it's--it's just that dean etwood asked me to finish out the semester...
for you.
I think maybe you should talk to her about this.
right. Of course.
um, well, it looks like you're all in good hands.
thank you.
so I'll... see you soon...
I hope.
thank you.
okay, uh, where was I?
Ted's piece...
I liked it. It reminded me of a fitzgerald short story.
what's on the menu?
Oh, my signature dish-- tuna casserole, but with chicken.
not to be confused with chicken casserole.
that's a whole different noodle-to-filling ratio.
aha, jt in time.
you gave my class to duncan bow?
I didn't know when you were coming back.
the students are serious about their writing, and they need a professor who's serious about teaching it to them.
it was an emergency.
I got caught up in a "once in a lifetime, never gonna happen again" emergency.
w-well, it was--it was a bit...
it was a bit of a tangle, leslie.
Dean etwood, I am committed to this class.
I am.
I don't wanna lose it.
okay, let see what I can do.
thank you.
by the way, what goes on with this duncan bow?
uh, he's one of our most popular teachers.
several of his novels have had interest from major publishing houses, and one of his short stories appeared in "the new yorker.
he was the closest thing dufresne had to a literary sensation...
until you came along.
I see.
and, um...
how did the rest of your day go?
you know, we haven't seen you since you went to get the paper.
Oh, yeah, it was fine.
Fine--good fine? Fine--bad fine?
just fine.
well, for the love of god, son, what did she say?
she said,"no." Okay?
I could go into a lot more detail, but the bottom line ishannah said no to me--to us.
sorry.
that's a tough break.
she really said no?
she did, but iays ok,'cause...
I still believe that one day, she'll say yes.
so what else is going on in the world?
and in washington today, congress held more hearings on global warming.
toy's focus was on rising eans...
greetings, earthling.
I come bearing hot fudge sundae fixin's.
yum.
yore my kind of alien.
this is way better than crop circles.
Oh, that it is.
you know what I love the most about the ice cream sundae?
tell me.
it is like the perfect example of the melting pot.
I mean, we've got whipped cream and ice cream.
I mean, that's two potentially competitive forms of sweetened cream, and yet here they are, happily complementing each other.
and then there's the hot fudge, which is the cool cream's archnemesis.
the screen look a little pale to you?
maybe it's just the way the light's hitting it.
no.
no, this is typical evening light.
something is off.
Hey, guys.
Hey, care to join us for what I like to think is a shining example of what our country can be?
ice cream sundae?
well, I don't mean to be unpatriotic, but I'm gonna head over to Sully's.
Ah, to bask in the glory of the "hail eddie"?
well, not so much basking as, um, making required public appearances.
what's the "hail eddie"?
just the defining moment in knights ridge sports history.
it was homecoming weekend.
the league title was on the line.
we were down by 4 with less than 10 seconds left on the clock.
Eddie scrambles out of two tackles.
he takes this monster hit, but he didn't fall, and then, with a defensive lineman on his back, eddie somehow drags himself into the end zone and scored the winning touchdown.
I have no knowledge of football whatsoever.
that still gave me the chills.
it might just be the ice cream.
Eddie, does brian williams look a little pale to you?
Yeah, he always looks pale.
not just pale.
waxy.
Wan.
almost consumptive.
something is seriously amiss.
you Catal do men clean up nicely.
well, these are for you.
Thanks.
the boys have something for sam.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
well, I wanted to, and they nted to.
Sam, jasper and casper are here.
we're sorry we broke your telescope.
Yeah, we never should've used it as a rock-smashing device.
here.
planetarium in a box.
this looks kinda cool.
Yeah, when you plug it in, it turns your room into a planetarium.
come on.
let's go set it up.
so... what was this all about?
well, I had a long talk with the twins, and their days of tormenting sam are over.
it's gonna be different this time.
I promise.
at what point do you think you're gonna get sick of reliving that play?
Oh, maybe never.
someday I hope to do something semi-noteworthy.
you will.
Hey, buddy. Big O.
Hey, janet.
Hey, how you holdin' up?
not sure, but I seem to manage, until it's time to go home.
it must be something, buddy boy. - What?
being you on homecoming weekend.
it's like being bobby orr and bobby kennedy and bobby brown, all rolled up into one.
I ran out of famous bobbys from boston.
Hey, it was your block that made the "hail eddie" possible, though.
Yeah, but nobody ever remembers the lineman.
I can only imagine the play you're gonna get.
well, not really.
are you kiddin'?
Oh, and the icing on the cake-- I hear the lyons twins-- both now divorced are coming back for tomorrow night's pre-game bash.
can you say,"double sessions"?
you know what, O.I, um...
let me talk to you later.
all right, cool.
cat I gesome rings?
Janet, are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine, eddie.
I just gotta get these pitchers rinsed out, and you probably gotta go stock up on matching prophylactics.
all right, listen...
I should have told him I was seeing someone.
Really?
really.
no.
I mean, really, are you seeing someone?
I am.
and what we need is an alison rowan birthday barbecue do-over.
you mean, we set a date and then you stand me ?
all right, maybe not so much a "do-over" as a...a "get it right.
come with me to the homecoming game as my date.
everyone will see us there.
we'll get it out of the way.
okay, so this really is... - A date.
okay.
excuse me.
who would've thought?
even "the punter's fried pickles" were sailing out of here.
they're not that half bad.
I may bring some to our tailgate party.
or not.
not 'cause of the fried pickles, but I'm not be able to make the tailgate party this year.
but we do it every year
me, you, my hibachi, your cassette of "foreigner's greatest hits,
our snide comments on how the jocks and cheerleaders have aged poorly?
I'm sorry.
I have a date.
you're going with eddie, aren't ya?
Yep.
can you believe it?
I'm going with eddie latekka.
we've sort of been seeing each other, or at least talking about seeing each other.
and given the ridge and its gossip mill, eddie figured, whabetter way to go public, you know?
get it out of the way.
get it out of the way"?
all the chatter.
HE--HE--HE wants to get it out of the way?
what are you, homework?
uh, a trip to the dentist? Taxes?
in this world, nothing is certain except death, taxes and letting the world know you're dating Janet Meadows.
I thought you'd be happy for me.
we have to play within our league, janet.
remember what happened when I was dating christy turlington?
it ended in heartbreak and tears and utter devastation.
you never dated christy turlington, oster.
exactly, and I never will.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
come here.
okay.
keep working on those last few...
Oh, I will. - Like I told you, okay?
hello. - How are you?
great. How are you?
excellent.
so I guess you heard I'm teaching my creative writing class again.
I did, I did.
and to be honest, thank god.
my course load was getting much too heavy.
besides, those students obviously enjoy you,"quake boy."
"quake boy"?
well, that's how ms. Diaz describes you...
in her novel.
she gave it to you to read?
she did.
it's a gem.
and I'm in it?
well, your fictional alter ego certainly is.
Rick garland, the former next big thing.
I really wouldn't have pegged you as a man who...
how did she describe it?
transcends type." Bookish, yet athletic. Self-absorbed, yet generous.
a lover whose touch causes not only her body but her soul...
to quake.
well, she does know how to turn a phrase.
she certainly does.
I really should go take another look-see.
I know she's anxiously awaiting my notes.
I'll see ya around.
I'll see ya.
so what do you think?
well, the semiconductors are shot, the tubes are barely holding on, and the high-vtage block isn't blocking.
which means...
well, which means...
you keep using this set, and the circuit boards are gonna go, and when they do, it won't be pretty.
well, there must be something we can do.
try to keep the set from overheating.
but even if you do, it's just a matter of time, and not much at that.
I'm sorry, pal.
so you wanna go to the homecoming game together?
cause obviously, I'm not bringing alison this year.
sorry, pal. I got a date.
Really? Who's the lucky lady?
Janet wh
Janet meadows is your date to homecoming?
Yep.
as in sully's janet meadows?
behind the bar" janet meadows?
always gives me extra blue cheese crumble with my buffalo wings" janet meadows?
the same.
how long have you two been...a twosome?
well, we've been circling around it for a while now.
Why? You think it's a mistake?
not at all. I just...thought she had better taste.
tongues are gonna wag.
so?
hate to think what everybody's saying about me these days.
can't let that stuff get to you.
Ah, it's not just that. It's...
every girl I've been with,
I knew why we were gonna break up two weeks before we started dating.
with janet...
I don't know.
isn't that a good thing?
not if you're the kind of guy who likes to break up two weeks after you start dating.
some nice moves you got there.
what moves?
you know, not falling off.
actually, still working on that.
I'm breaking it in.
just drove this board off the lot yesterday.
I didn't miss your birthday, did I?
Nah.
one of big cat's peace offerings.
big cat's been coming around bearing gifts?
you didn't hear?
big cat's making a comeback.
I must've missed the press conference.
Yeah, sorry.
I was rootin' for you.
see you around.
see you, sam.
be careful on that thing. - I'll try.
this urs yo way of saying sorry?
letting me watch you buy the paper?
there's a pack of gum in it for you.
also, I wanted a chance to explain why I said what I said last night.
here you go, lotte.
exact change for you today.
quick snack? - Sure.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
it's just--you know what kind of guy he is.
he's not just a player.
he's the entire team.
I know what kind of guy he is.
I'm not gonna burn my tongue on these again, am I, joyce?
we don't roast 'em that hot anymore, rooster.
not since you threatened to sue.
so why are you even giving him the time of day?
well, what's going on with me and him--it's different.
he's different when he's with me.
one more stop.
that's what all the girls he's dated tell themselves.
they all think it's gonna be different.
thank you, susan.
and, kaela, please be careful with that bread slicer.
anyway, look, janet, here's the thing.
you say you know his reputation, but...
Yeah, I know his reputation, but people can change.
rooster, you used to be the guy who owned the largest ant farm collection in massachusetts, but nobody calls you "captain arthropod" anymore.
okay, but did you notice susan and kaela back there in the bakery?
Yeah, what about 'em?
along with lotte at the newsstand and joyce who sells chestnuts, that makes four-- four of eddie's conquests.
and we haven't even turned down main street.
that's what I'm talking about.
you set this whole thing up just to make a point?
what kind of person does that?
you needed to see.
Oh, I see all right.
I see one very cruel, cruel man.
Janet, come back.
don't you want your gum?
forget about it. - Yes.
either of you guys got the time?
you got somewhere you gotta be?
Yeah, I got the booster dinner.
didn't you wonder why I was wearing a suit?
I did, but I thought you looked so nice, so...
can you believe big cat's making a comeback?
the guy's like the roger clemens of romance.
look, hannah's a great girl and all that, but you two are past tense, ancient history past tense.
you gotta make your peace with that.
it's too bad you dumped aubrey.
she was hot.
and very cool.
potent combo.
you should get aubrey back.
you should un-break up with her.
no, I'm not ready to un-break up with anybody.
Hey, maybe she's ready to un-break up with you.
Yeah, I can't think of a better way to get you over hannah jane.
what do you think your chances are with aubrey?
I don't know.
although she did write that my fictional alter ego was "a lover whose touch caused not just her body, but her soul to quake."
what? She did? When did she write that?
when did you quake her soul?
I didn'T. There was never any soul quaking.
two kisses were the sum total of our relationship.
it's just a work of fiction-- something that sprang up from aubrey's imagination.
well, I like the way she thinks.
me, too.
I love aubrey's imagination.
I would build-- I would build a summer home in her imagination.
I would.
honely, I don't even know if she wrote that.
that guy duncan bow probably just made it up to get my goat.
who's duncanow?
he's this teacher that aubrey gave her novel to instead of me.
and I don't like him.
we gotta get that book.
we gotta break into duncan bow's office and read that book.
you're kidding, right? - No.
Nicky, he's right. He's right.
you--you read that book, you find out what aubrey really thinks of you.
I don't wanna know how she feels about me.
yeah-- no, it be like a manual on how to navigate your approach.
you almost owe it toer.
she just gave it to duncan bow to make you jealous to get your attention.
you heard the dean.
he's never published anything.
you've written a best seller. - Yep.
I mean, you know that she doesn't really want his help.
Yeah, yeah, so don't do it for yourself to-- to satisfy your own curiosity.
do it for the sake of the written word.
Yes, for the english language.
for the betterment of all mankind.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm in.
looking for a third. - Yes.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
what? What is it?
what are these for?
to protect our identity.
we're not wearing ski masks.
Ronnie, just give me the screwdriver.
okay, fine. Suit yourselves.
what? - He's kling me.
looks like a simple latch lock.
step aside.
here's how you open a door.
awesome.
it's burning up.
you know, maybe this is a good thing.
maybe this is what you need to keep you moving forward, taking more baby steps to free yourself of your fear f the outside.
you don't understand.
well, then help me.
help me understand.
okay.
okay, so right now I'm fine, right?
not a care.
still fine.
still fine.
still fine.
okay, now my heart's starting to race.
cold sweat cleats the forehead.
lump in my throat the size of a cantaloupe.
trouble breathing.
chest about to explode.
okay, that's enough.
I understand. Come back inside.
okay.
it's been that way for six years, and that whole time, Jason has been here with me.
you named your tv?
of course.
he's my constant companion, my faithful window onto the world.
I see.
I'll help you wash those.
no, that's okay.
I'm just gonna throw 'em in brenda.
who has snow globes, a hula dancer, and a bust of dante on their desk?
I don't know, but I think the hula dancer's kind of fine.
what is it?
I was just thinkin'...
Ikey would've loved this.
Hey, nick, how do we even know that the book is in here?
you know how we know?
cause I just found it.
I found the book.
the novel? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've been soaking these puppies in vodka for a week.
we'll break 'em out at halftime.
ray cataldo-- the man who invented the chewable screwdriver.
this is nice...
being back together.
Yeah, it is.
you know, I don't wanna go back.
the way we've been the last three years...
tuesday, thursday, every other saturday.
Oh, okay.
well, that's how you feel, I mean, we can take it slow.
we'll get over the speed bumps easier that way.
actually, I was hoping to fly right by 'em.
one, uh,"nick garrett moving back to town speed bump" in particular.
Hey, you remember that lilac bush you helped me plant last year?
Yeah, the one in your backyard? - Yeah.
you know that thing's still blooming?
I mean, here we are end of november, and my backyard still smells like spring.
mm, global warming.
Nah, frost killed everything else.
you know, that bush...
it's what we do.
here in knights ridge, we stay, we put down roots, and we watch 'em grow.
you know I love it when you break out the gardening metaphors.
will you marry me, hannah jane?
it's the only way I can do this.
if we're gonna get back together, it has to be all or nothing at all.
ray, it's-- it's just so fast.
Hannah, if you can look me in the eye and honestly tell me that if that speed bump hadn't moved back into town six weeks ago, that we wouldn't be picking a reception hall and hiring a caterer right now, then, okay, I'm wrong, and, uh, and you should tell me "no.
uh, opening boozy bar scene...
boozy. - Booze.
tortured adolescence.
uh, road trip to big sur. Come on.
okay, okay, here I am.
he'd just arrived from philadelphia.
his eyes were deep brown with a mischievous sparkle.
no? Maybe.
there was something irresistible about him.
he had the confident air of a man who always gets what he wants.
okay, I'm officially bored.
Yeah, can we get to the soul quaking?
all right, all right. All right.
okay, let's go.
I'm an idiot.
it's not that bad.
Okay,"operation: Rekindle aubrey's interest" can still be salvaged.
there never should've been an "operation: Rekindle aubrey's interest.
the only girl whose interest I wanted to rekindle was hannah'S.
and all this was just a drunken, lame attemp to forget that.
what did aubrey write about you?
he had the confident air of a man who always gets what he wants.
if it's hannah you want, it's hannah you're gonna get.
well, you seem to be forgetting one very inconvenient truth.
she's not interested.
didn't say it was gonna be easy.
it's gonna take a perfect game of long ball.
which means you gotta play it cool for a while...
a long while.
you're friendly, but not too friendly.
around, but not available.
let her do her thing with ray...
Yes, and when hannah finally realizes what all of us have known for forever that big cat is a complete tool...there you are.
Yeah, but no proclamations.
no big gestures.
nothing till then.
long ball, huh?
long ball.
long ball!
long ball!
you guys are free to go.
they're not gonna press any charges.
Yes. You see?
you wanted out. We got out.
he always gets what he wants. - Always gets what he wants.
I'll get another one.
be right back.
go, knights. - Cool.
long ball. - Longall.
long ball.
well... hey, nice going, G.
gordon liddy.
when I think of botched-up break-ins, my mind naturally goes back to watergate.
you heard? - Oh, ye.
O. O. Wait! Wait!
you stay! I'll go.
gosh, how ar you? - It's been so long.
good to see you.
can I have a kiss? - I guess.
me, too.
so what's going on?
okay, thursday at 2: 30-- pep rally just like they used to
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, dean.
there was nothing I could do, nick.
you broke into a faculty member's office.
the college has rules.
so I'M...
Yes, you're through.
Yeah. Okay.
great.
what's going on, baby?
you both have cats named mouse, huh?
Yes, we do.
imagine that.
will, um, will you hold this for a second?
sure.
excuse me.
Hey, Janet. Can I get a beer?
you know, this whole you and me going to the homecoming game
it's a bad idea.
cause here's the thing.
I'm not taxes.
I'm not the dentist.
I'm not something you get out of the way.
what?
I'm also not like the other girls you've been with.
I'm not a cute cashier.
I don't know how to make waffle cones.
I'm not another stop along the eddie latekka conquest trail.
I'm not perky like susan, I don't bat my eyes like lotte, and I certainly don't have double "d" cups like
you know what?
you're not like the other girls I usually date.
you're smart and funny and beautiful, inside and out.
you're absolutely nothing like taxes.
excuse me.
I don't think I can do it.
you can.
look...
I know jason's been with you, here by your side for all these years, and no one and nothing is ever gonna replace him.
but...
I'm not going anywhere.
and...
maybe, just maybe until you're ready to step outside...
I could be your window onto the world, but a different kind of window,'cause unlike Jason,
I'm not gonna focus on the worst of what's out there
on the wars or the natural disasters or the violent crimes.
I'm gonna bring you the puddles on centre street after a thunderstorm, and the sun rising over crystal lake, and the mcmahons--they've been married for 50 years, and they still hold hands when they go for a walk.
that sounds nice.
and one more thing I'm gonna do...
and if you tell me jason's ever done that, I will run out of here screaming.
okay.
I'm ready.
okay, that time you startled me.
you broke into professor bow's office to read my novel?
that's... one way of putting it.
how else would you put it?
okay, you pretty much nailed it.
I guess it's kind of flattering in an incredibly stalkersh kind of way.
Yeah, just...
focus on the flattering part.
Oh, I intend to.
no, that's...not what I meant.
good-bye, Jason.
thanks for everything you showed me.
may you rest in peace.
amazing, right?
who would've thunk it?
I asked...
she said yes.
never underestimate the charity of women.
...so I humbIy suggest that you just forget aII this and go Iive your Iife.
go Iive my Iife? I am Iiving my Iife. I'd Iike to continue to Iive my Iife.
I know. Of course. I mean aII of it. However Iong you have Ieft.
you know, I mean, Howard, you couId use it to have an adventure.
you know, invent something, or just finish reading Crime and Punishment.
heII, HaroId, you couId just eat nothing but pancakes if you wanted.
what's wrong with you?
Hey. I don't wanna eat nothing but pancakes. I wanna Iive.
who in their right mind in a choice between pancakes and Iiving...
...chooses pancakes?
HaroId, if you'd pause to think I beIieve you'd reaIize...
...that that answer's inextricabIy contingent...
...upon the type of Iife being Ied...
you don't understand what I'm saying.
Yes, I do.
but you have to understand that this isn't a phiIosophy or a Iiterary theory...
...or a story to me. It's my Iife.
AbsoIuteIy. So just go make it the one you've aIways wanted.
I never expected that they wouId have
do you want one, two? -I want one.
one? -I want two.
aII right, so here's your room.
or as I Iike to caII it, SIeep Pod Two.
Thanks, Dave.
no probIem, dude. It'II be nice having you around.
how Iong you pIanning on staying? -I'm not sure.
Dave, can I pose a somewhat abstract, pureIy hypotheticaI question?
sure.
if you knew you were gonna die...
...possibIy soon...
...what wouId you do?
wow, I don't know.
am I the richest man in the worId?
no, you're you.
do I have a superpower?
no, you're you.
I know I'm me, but do I have a superpower?
no, why wouId you have a superpower?
I don't know, you said it was hypotheticaI.
fine. Yes. You're reaIIy good at math.
that's not a power, that's a skiII.
okay, you're good at math and you're invisibIe.
and you know you're gonna die. -Okay, okay.
that's easy, I'd go to space camp.
space camp?
Yeah, it's in AIabama. It's where kids go to Iearn how to become astronauts.
I've aIways wanted to go since I was 9.
you're invisibIe and you'd go to space camp?
I didn't pick invisibIe, you picked invisibIe.
aren't you too oId to go to space camp?
you're never too oId to go to space camp, dude.
space camp.
one hundred and twenty-two guitars.
seven hundred and thirty-two strings.
two hundred and fifty-seven pickups.
one hundred and eighty-nine volume knobs.
here Harold stood, face to face with his oldest desire.
and stand is almost all Harold did.
lt wasn't just about finding a guitar.
lt was about finding a guitar that said something about Harold.
unfortunately, this guitar said:
" when l get back to Georgia, that woman gonna feel my pain. "
this one said something along the lines of:
" why, yes, these pants are Lycra. "
these said, " l'm very sensitive, very caring and l have absolutely no idea how to play the guitar. "
" l'm compensating for something. Guess what. "
and then Harold saw it.
a damaged and terribly mistreated sea-foam-green Fender staring back at him.
despite its obvious maladies...
...the guitar spoke with conviction and swagger.
ln fact, it looked Harold directly in the eye and very plainly stated:
" l rock. "
just breathe. Watch it!
we've got a 21-year-oId maIe with a gunshot wound to the chest.
there you go.
shot in a gang fight? HaroId's not in a gang.
man in tweed?
there's nothing wrong with him, he just Iikes Iooking at sick peopIe.
OddIy spoken with disdain.
this isn't working.
WeII-- I don't even know why we're here.
I don't think we're supposed to be here.
you said I needed visuaI stimuIi. -I meant a museum.
I don't need a goddamn museum. I need the infirm.
you are the infirm.
you're right. The probIem is these peopIe aren't dead...
...they're just severeIy injured.
excuse me, where are the dying peopIe?
most of these peopIe are sick or injured
which is great, don't get me wrong.
but they're gonna get better, which doesn't reaIIy heIp me.
is there any way to see the peopIe who aren't going to get better?
excuse me?
I'd Iike to see, if at aII possibIe, the ones who aren't gonna make it.
you know, the dead-for-sure ones.
I'm sorry, are you suffering from anything?
just writer's bIock.
with every awkward strum...
...Harold Crick became stronger in who he was , what he wanted, and why he was alive.
Harold no longer ate alone.
he no longer counted brushstrokes.
HaroId, I'II see you. - He no longer wore neckties.
Bye, Dave.
and, therefore, no longer worried about the time it took to put them on.
he no longer counted his steps to the bus stop.
Lnstead, Harold did that which had terrified him before.
that which had eluded him Monday through Friday for so many years.
that which the unrelenting lyrics of numerous punk-rock songs told him to do:
Harold Crick lived his life.
but despite resuscitating his life , reviving his hope, and instilling a few wicked calluses...
...Harold's journey was still incomplete.
and Harold's wristwatch wasn't about to let him miss another opportunity.
ms. PascaI?
ms. PascaI? -Mr. Crick.
Hi. -Hi.
Hi. -Hi.
I'm gIad I caught you.
Oh, yeah? Why?
because I wanted to bring these to you.
ReaIIy? -Yeah.
so you can't accept gifts, but you can give them?
listen-- -I don't know.
that seems a IittIe inconsistent, doesn't it, Mr. Crick?
very inconsistent, yes.
I'II teII you what. I'II purchase them.
no. -No, no, no, reaIIy...
...I'd Iike to purchase them. What are they?
fIours.
what? -I brought you fIours.
and you carried them aII the way here?
ms. PascaI, I've been odd and I know that I've been odd.
and I want you.
what? -There's so many reasons.
there's so many infIuences in my Iife that are teIIing me at times quite IiteraIIy that I shouId come here and bring you these...
...but I'm doing this because I want you.
you want me?
in no uncertain terms.
isn't there some very cIear and estabIished ruIe about fraternization?
Auditor-auditee protocoI? -Yeah.
Yeah, but I don't care.
Why? -Because I want you.
weII...
...do you mind carrying those a IittIe bit further?
okay.
okay.
did you make a key?
no, I just committed it to memory.
the bIue, that's barIey fIour. -What's that one?
the orange? -Yeah.
I forget.
right here.
do you wanna come up?
to your pIace? -Yeah.
I guess I couId.
wasn't that the idea with the fIours and everything?
HonestIy, I onIy figured it out up to " I want you. "
listen, Mr. Crick...
...I think I Iike you.
and before I do anything rash, I'd Iike to make sure.
I'd Iike you to come up.
I'd be honored.
great.
Yeah, he was nuts though.
he got caught when he tried to get the contract notarized.
no. No.
was it good?
thank you.
you're weIcome. -Can I heIp you?
no, no, I'm gonna put them in the sink. Go sit down on the couch.
so do you pIay the guitar?
what? - Do you pIay the guitar?
TerribIy. Someone traded me that for a wedding cake.
does that mean I have to cIaim it on my taxes now?
no. I'II Ieave it out of my finaI report. - Oh, thanks.
do you pIay?
not reaIIy. I onIy know one song.
Oh, pIay it.
no, I don't know it that weII, actuaIIy.
no, come on. I promise I'm not gonna Iaugh at you. PIay it.
no, no, no. Maybe some other time.
aII right.
ms. PascaI?
I... - I know.
I want you too.
Harold's life was filled with moments both significant and mundane.
but to Harold, those moments remained entirely indistinguishable...
...except for this.
as Ana let out a soft sigh and repositioned herself against him...
...Harold knew somewhere in his heart...
...that this was one of the significant moments.
he knew she was falling in love with him.
professor HiIbert. It's a comedy.
what? - A comedy.
the woman. The one who hates me. Ana PascaI?
last night... -Yeah?
she's faIIing in Iove with me.
she is? - It's Iike a miracIe.
the voice confirmed it in the middIe of the night.
weII, that's wonderfuI, HaroId.
I mean, it compIeteIy nuIIifies my Iist, but that's fantastic.
what Iist?
these are seven Iiving authors whose prior work wouId seem to make them candidates to write your story， based on the criteria you and I previousIy determined.
if your narrator is aIive, she's on this Iist.
but it appears the Iist is of IittIe use to you now.
now that you're gonna Iive happiIy ever after.
Oh, goodie. This woman, Karen EiffeI, she's one of my favorite authors.
Hi. - Hi.
beautifuI tragedies. Just beautifuI. Anyway...
...Iet me quickIy copy this Iist for you, just in case.
sociopathic author.
I just wanted to thank you. - Of course.
listen, pIease, you must teII me if you hear the voice of the narrator again...
...just for my own edification.
I wiII.
well, it's called Death and Taxes.
Wow. You know, l'm from Texas.
no. Not " Texas. " Taxes.
death and Taxes. Death and Taxes.
taxes. Like the Benjamin Franklin quote.
precisely so.
this lady's a package, l'm telling you.
tell us, what is this next book going to be about?
lt's about interconnectivity.
the looming certainty of death.
men's fashion accessories.
Oh, my God, that's her. - What?
that's the voice. She's the narrator. -No, that can't be right.
no, I'm positive.
HaroId, this interview's a decade oId.
l didn't think anyone actually wore cuff links anymore.
that's her.
she's British? - She's her.
Karen EiffeI? - Professor HiIbert, I know that voice.
crap.
what's wrong? - First of aII, she wasn't on my Iist.
I figured you wouId have mentioned the accent and she doesn't...
she kiIIs peopIe.
what? - In every book she
the books are aII about-- They die. She kiIIs them.
kiIIs who? - The heroes.
four BIack VeiIs. What is that?
lt's about a girl who loses several members of her family in quick succession.
where is she?
she's untraceabIe. BeIieve me, I used to teach a cIass on her.
I've written her Ietters. I mean, she's a hermit, she's a recIuse.
here. Here's the Iast book she wrote.
look at the copyright. She hasn't pubIished anything in 1 0 years.
she had knowIedge of the city. Does she Iive here?
she used to, yes, but I mean
banneker Press. 2267 WaIIace Street. Is that her pubIisher?
you're not Iistening. I said even if you find her she's not gonna
thank you for your heIp.
she onIy writes tragedies!
l don't believe in God.
okay, he's bringing her fIours.
Kay, where you been?
I went out to buy cigarettes...
...and I figured out how to kiII HaroId Crick.
buying cigarettes?
as I was-- When I came out of the store...
...it came to me.
how?
weII, Penny, Iike anything worth writing...
...it came inexpIicabIy and without method.
I see. Then what happens?
it's perfect, actuaIIy. I can't beIieve I didn't think of it earIier.
it's simpIe, ironic...
...possibIy heartbreaking.
is that it?
Yes.
you wrote it on IegaI sheets? - On the bus.
weII, then.
so I'II finish it today.
I'II Iet the pubIishers know.
I'II begin packing my things.
I appreciate it.
Hi. HeIIo. Hi. - May I heIp you?
I need to speak to Karen EiffeI.
I'm sorry? - Karen EiffeI.
she's one of your authors. I need to taIk to her.
weII, sir, she's not here.
no. No, I know. I need to find her. I need to know where she is.
we're just the pubIishers.
right. Of course. But there must be a way that I can contact her.
we have the address where her fan maiI is sent.
no, I can't send maiI. It's urgent.
how do you know her?
I'm her brother. - Her brother?
her brother-in-Iaw. - She has a sister?
no, I'm married to her brother.
not in this state, the one over.
sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to Ieave.
no. Okay. Listen.
I'm one of her characters. I'm new. I'm in her new book.
and she's going to kiII me. Not actuaIIy. But in the book.
but I think it'II actuaIIy kiII me so I just need to taIk to her and ask her to stop.
Hi, HaroId. Nice sweater.
Hi, HaroId. Phones are out.
Hey, HaroId, 1 9 percent of 4632...?
Hey, HaroId. Back from your vaca?
Hey. Looking good.
he Iooks terribIe. - Yeah, banged up.
wherever he went, I do not want to go.
book me not there.
he's totaIIy ignoring me.
here, Iook at this now. There he goes.
it was good having you.
Oh, dude, the phones are out. - Can I borrow your ceII phone?
the signaI's down. - Damn it.
you aII right? - Dave, I need a favor.
sure, what is it? - Can I have some change?
within moments, Harold found himself running across the plaza...
...heading for the nearest pay phone.
at last, he spotted it.
but as Harold neared the phone, he saw it was occupied by an octogenarian determined to reach his daughter in Denver...
...no matter how many quarters it took.
fortunately, Harold remembered a bank of phones...
...in the Sixth Street subway tunnel.
the baby's name isn't Mrs. Epstein. My daughter's name is Mrs. Epstein.
the first phone failed to give a dial tone.
and the second seemed to be splattered with a fresh batch of mucus.
Harold dialed the third phone...
...fervently making sure to give each number key a specific forceful push.
don't answer that!
didn't you say this phone never r--?
HeIIo? - Is this Karen EiffeI?
Yes. -My name is HaroId Crick.
I beIieve you're writing a story about me.
I'm sorry? - My name is HaroId Crick.
is this a joke? - No.
no, I work for the IRS. My name, Miss EiffeI, is HaroId Crick.
when l go through the files at work l hear a deep and endless ocean.
Oh, God! - Miss Eiffel?
HeIIo?
miss Eiffel? Hello?
let him in.
HeIIo.
HeIIo.
I'm Penny. I'm Kay's assistant.
Oh, I'm HaroId. Her main character.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
miss EiffeI?
your hair. Your eyes.
your fingers.
your shoes.
HeIIo.
I'm HaroId Crick.
I know.
how did you find me?
we audited you a IittIe more than 10 years ago...
...and your number was in the fiIe.
I'm sorry, but this is incredibIy strange.
you're teIIing me.
didn't you think you were crazy?
sort of.
but then you were right about everything. Like, everything.
and then you said, " LittIe did he know. "
"LittIe did he know'"? - Yeah. It's third-person omniscient.
Jesus.
which meant it was, weII, you know, someone other than me.
at Ieast that's what Professor HiIbert said.
professor HiIbert?
professor JuIes HiIbert? - Yeah.
Yeah, he Ioves your books.
I Iove his Ietters. I don't
so you understand why I had to find you...
...and ask you not to kiII me. - What?
I mean, obviousIy you haven't written the end.
I mean, now since we've met and you can see that I exist...
...you're not gonna kiII me, right?
have you written it?
I can-- No.
have you written it? -An outIine.
okay. But it's just an outIine, right?
Yeah, sort of. - " Sort of " ?
it's just not typed. - " Not typed " ?!
maybe that's okay. -What does that mean?
I'm sorry, I'm trying to write a book. - What do you mean it's " okay " ?
what do you mean you're sorry? - Kay.
let him read it.
let him read it.
did you find her? - Yeah.
And? - I may aIready be dead...
...just not typed.
is that it?
did you read it?
I tried, but I couIdn't.
you have to read it.
you have to teII me what to do or what not to do.
if I can avoid it...
if I have a chance...
pIease.
okay.
okay.
and here's your uniform.
it's a go. Banetta's outside, she'II assign you your Iocker.
and you roII. - I'm ready.
professor HiIbert?
Hi, HaroId. - Hi.
you Iook tired.
no, no, just caIm.
HaroId, I'm sorry.
you have to die.
what?
it's her masterpiece.
it's possibIy the most important noveI in her aIready stunning career...
...and it's absoIuteIy no good unIess you die at the end.
I've been over it again and again...
...and I know how hard this is for you to hear.
you're asking me to knowingIy face my death?
Yes.
ReaIIy?
Yes.
I thought you'd... I thought you'd find something.
I'm sorry, HaroId.
can't we just try and just see if she can change it?
no. - No?
...in the grand scheme it wouIdn't matter.
Yes, it wouId. -No.
I couId change.
I couId quit my job.
I couId go away with Ana.
I couId be someone eIse.
HaroId, Iisten to me.
I can't die right now.
it's just reaIIy bad timing.
no one wants to die, HaroId, but unfortunateIy we do.
HaroId, Iisten to me.
HaroId, you wiII die someday, sometime.
heart faiIure at the bank.
choke on a mint.
some long, drawn-out disease you contracted on vacation.
you wiII die. You wiII absoIuteIy die.
even if you avoid this death, another wiII find you.
and I guarantee that it won't be nearIy as poetic or meaningfuI as what she's written.
I'm sorry...
...but it's the nature of aII tragedies, HaroId.
the hero dies, but the story Iives on forever.
there's an empty seat right there. - No, I wanna sit down over here.
how many peopIe do you think I've kiIIed?
Kay. - How many?
I don't know. - Eight.
Kay---I've kiIIed eight peopIe. I counted.
they're fictionaI. Get up.
haroid Crick isn't fictionaI.
I don't-- -He isn't fictionaI, Penny.
every book I've ever written ends with someone dying. Every one.
reaIIy nice peopIe too.
the book about HeIen the schooIteacher.
I kiIIed her the day before summer vacation.
how crueI is that?
and the civiI engineer, Edward.
the one I trapped with a heart attack in rush hour.
I kiIIed him.
I kiIIed...
penny, I kiIIed them aII.
miss EiffeI? Miss EiffeI?
HaroId. - Hi.
I just finished it. -You just...
Yeah, I read it aII in one read on the bus.
it's IoveIy.
I Iike the part about the guitars.
no, I read it and I Ioved it. And there's onIy one way it can end.
I mean, I don't have much background in Iiterary anything...
...but this seems simpIe enough.
I Iove your book. And I think you shouId finish it.
the night before his death...
...Harold unsuspectingly went about some usual business.
he finished his outstanding audits.
he made a few phone calls he had been putting off.
listen, does your program have an age Iimit?
and he traveled to Ms. Pascal's...
...where she made him meat loaf and chocolate pudding...
...and the two watched old movies.
lt was a nice enough evening.
and in any other circumstance it would've seemed commonplace.
ln fact, the only thing that made this night significant was the morning it preceded.
I have to teII you something.
you do?
I do.
is it a secret? - Sort of.
teII me.
I adore you.
I adore you too.
that it? - No.
I have to teII you this.
I just want you to Iisten carefuIIy.
okay.
you can deduct the vaIue of aII the food you give away as a charitabIe contribution. -HaroId.
no, no, no. In fact it amounts to more than what you're currentIy withhoIding.
and it doesn't break any tax Iaws.
HaroId, the point is to break the tax Iaws.
I wanna make the worId a better pIace too, Ana.
I think that means keeping you out of jaiI.
okay.
okay?
Yeah. - Okay.
if you come over here...
...and taIk a IittIe more tax taIk in my ear.
because I Iike it so much.
much had changed for Harold over the past few weeks:
his attitude towards work.
his habitual counting.
his love life.
but of all the transmutations Harold Crick had undergone...
...perhaps the most significant was that today on his return to work...
...he was not late for the 8:17 Kronecker bus.
what Harold had not understood...
...about that Wednesday four weeks prior...
...was that the time he received from his fellow commuter...
...was, in fact, three full minutes later than the actual time...
...and, therefore, three full minutes later than the time to which his watch and life had been previously set.
not the worst of errors.
but if Harold had not set his watch to the incorrect time...
...Harold would have again barely caught the 8: 17 Kronecker bus.
and he would not be approaching the bus stop precisely at 8: 1 4 this particular Friday.
excuse me.
an otherwise ignorable fact...
...until the unthinkable occurred.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I need for everyone to just stay seated.
come on, son.
what happened? I didn't see him. - It was not your fauIt.
he was trying to heIp the boy. Get your supervisor.
I don't beIieve this.
it was aII my fauIt, though. -No, it wasn't.
is he okay?
it Iooks Iikes he's breathing. - I don't think he's breathing.
Oh, my God.
come in.
excuse me.
are you Professor HiIbert?
Yes.
Hi. I'm Karen EiffeI.
I beIieve we have a mutuaI acquaintance.
PIease, sit down.
no, I just came by to...
here.
is that it? - Yes.
have you read it?
is that aII right?
Yes.
I think, perhaps, you may be interested in the new ending.
good afternoon.
Oh, hi.
it's a pretty brave thing you did.
stepping in front of that bus was pretty brave.
kind of stupid, but pretty brave.
Oh, yeah.
is that boy okay?
he's just fine. Scratched up is aII.
Oh, good.
am I okay?
weII, you're not dead.
on the other hand, it Iooks Iike you cracked your head...
...you broke three bones in your Ieg and foot...
...you suffered four broken ribs, fractured your Ieft arm...
...and severed an artery in your right, which shouId've kiIIed you in minutes.
but amazingIy...
...a shard of metaI from your watch obstructed the artery...
...keeping the bIood Ioss Iow enough to keep you aIive...
...which is pretty cooI.
Yeah. So with some physicaI therapy...
...a few months of rest, you shouId be fine.
weII, sort of. We weren't abIe to remove the shard of watch from your arm without risking severe arteriaI damage.
you'II be okay. You'II just have a piece of watch embedded in your arm the rest of your Iife.
you're very Iucky to be aIive, Mr. Crick.
Yeah.
Dr. Mercator, Mr. Crick has a visitor. -Sure.
my God, HaroId. - Hey.
I'm okay. It's aII right. - HaroId.
I'm fine.
HaroId, you're not fine.
look at you. You're severeIy injured.
no, I'm fine. -What--? What happened?
I stepped in front of a bus.
what? Why?
there was a boy. I had to push him out of the way.
what?
I had to keep this boy from getting hit.
you stepped in front of a bus to save a IittIe boy?
I didn't have a choice.
I had to.
it's... It's okay.
it's not great. -No.
it's okay. It's not bad.
it's not the most amazing piece of EngIish Iiterature in severaI years...
...but it's okay.
you know...
...I think I'm fine with " okay. "
it doesn't make sense with the rest of the book though.
no, not yet. I'II rewrite the rest.
my assistant said she'd go back to the pubIisher...
...and request more time. -Why?
don't know. It's awfully sweet though.
no, why did you change the book?
lots of reasons.
I reaIized I just couIdn't do it.
because he's reaI?
because it's a book about a man who doesn't know he's about to die and then dies.
but if the man does know he's going to die and dies anyway，dies wiIIingIy, knowing he couId stop it, then...
I mean, isn't that the type of man you want to keep aIive?
as Harold took a bite of Bavarian sugar cookie...
...he finally felt as if everything was going to be okay.
sometimes, when we lose ourselves in fear and despair...
...in routine and constancy...
...in hopelessness and tragedy...
...we can thank God for Bavarian sugar cookies.
and fortunately, when there aren't any cookies...
...we can still find reassurance in a familiar hand on our skin...
...or a kind and loving gesture...
...or a subtle encouragement...
...or a loving embrace...
...or an offer of comfort.
not to mention hospital gurneys...
...and nose plugs...
...and uneaten Danish...
...and soft-spoken secrets...
...and Fender Stratocasters...
...and maybe the occasional piece of fiction.
and we must remember that all these things...
...the nuances, the anomalies, the subtleties...
...which we assume only accessorize our days...
...are, in fact, here for a much larger and nobler cause:
they are here to save our lives.
l know the idea seems strange.
but l also know that it just so happens to be true.
and so it was:
a wristwatch saved Harold Crick.
hang a right.
right again.
now left.
which way now?
after the bridge, hard left.
shit!
go for it!
Bruno escaped last night.
what do we do?
nothing. What can we do?
he'll try to contact us.
no, he'll disappear.
where can he go?
I don't care. Not here, at least.
let me finish, will you?
calling all cars, suspect individual outside FNAC store,
tall, red jacket,
who's calling?
Mr. Jaquillat is out. Where can he reach you?
I'll tell him.
it was him. He didn't say where he was.
I gathered that.
call Freddy.
what can I get you?
double espresso. Good and strong.
shit.
hi there, Freddy.
I didn't recognize you.
I've aged.
it's not that. I wasn't expecting you so soon.
15 years early. - I didn't mean that.
is Jaquillat around?
no, I never see him.
he sold me the bar. - He did?
I'll try his place.
that may not be a good idea.
I can get you across to ltaly.
screw ltaly.
what do you want then?
to speak to Jaquillat. - He won't see you.
he's too much to lose now.
come back tomorrow.
that's the easiest.
I won't come back tomorrow.
I want to see him right now.
call him.
you're a real shit.
not very clever, Freddy.
look, Bruno......
I'm sorry.
evening, Jeanne.
you're crazy. The cops are out front.
I know. I came in the back way.
weren't you expecting me?
of course. I knew you'd come by at some point.
how are you doing?
okay.
and the others?
I've no idea.
I haven't seen them in ages.
we were kept apart.
mireille finds it hard.
and Gérard's going stir crazy.
they'll be ok when they're out. I'm taking care of it.
you can't get them out. Take your chance to get away.
I won't leave them.
nobody abandoned me. I couldn't have escaped alone.
I'll get them out. We have lots to do.
not me. Count me out.
don't worry. I only came for the keys.
you still have them?
let's fetch them.
don't come up. The cops will be coming round.
it's better that the kid and Francis don't see you.
you have a kid?
a little boy.
that's nice.
OK, I'll wait here.
I'll be quick. I still have some souvenirs to burn.
I'll throw the keys out the window.
good to see you again.
not in bed yet? - I was waiting for you.
any excuse will do.
right, get to bed now. I'll come and see you.
why don't you let him stay up?
it'll soon be vacation.
precisely. It's not yet vacation.
what are you doing, mummy?
tidying up. Sleep now.
that's fine, thanks. See you.
time to strike back
get the boss or nothing will change
revenge will be ours!
are you new?
don't recognize me, Mrs. Guiot?
clear off, Bruno. Jean-Jean's not in.
I know.
the cops came. They searched the place.
leave Jean-Jean alone.
he's gone south looking for work.
he won't be back anytime soon.
anyway, he won't see you.
he's put you and the others behind him. It's over.
now, he's taking care of me.
he was with me, Mrs. Guiot.
he helped me escape.
the cops shot at us. He won't come back.
where is he?
out in the East.
the cops know. They'll bring him home.
why did you come here?
I didn't want the cops to tell you.
and I have this for you.
I'll take care of you now.
I'll send you more. You'll want for nothing.
clear off. I'd rather die than take anything from you.
it wasn't my fault.
clear off!
sorry.
I just moved in. I got the wrong door.
shit! You fool!
calling all cars, "Partridge" sighted around 23: 00, Cité Gagarine,
short hair, moustache,
goatee beard,
carrying a sports bag and a military knapsack in green canvas covered in doodles,
like a student 20 years ago,
with all that, you can't miss him,
happy hunting and take care, he knows we are onto him,
the destruction of the law courts proves we can strike at will,
no member of the system is safe,
we demand our comrades " release,
the Popular Army still got nothing to say?
puma to base, we are in place, nothing doing,
we'll check out the building and get back to you,
I hear you, Puma, be careful,
double espresso. Strong.
hi there, Banane.
don't hang around.
don't move!
I said I've nothing.
let's look harder.
that way.
go on, help yourself.
go now!
you never saw me, ok?
turn round, hands against the wall.
feet apart.
who's that? - Her hubby. He's a cop.
that's why nobody will sell to her. Orders.
whose orders? - I don't know and I don't want to.
I'll tell you. It's a guy called Jaquillat.
I want you to set up a meeting. I have 2 tons of hash to sell.
cheap. - And who are you?
don't get smart. The name's Yvan.
how do I contact you?
you don't contact me. I'll come by.
stay here for at least 10 minutes.
what the hell? I told you to split! What's wrong?
cops are all over.
you got a fallback?
what for?
I haven't done anything.
see you.
do we have to stay much longer?
you'll be fine with me.
I have to go.
not yet. It's too soon.
I can't wait any longer. I just can't.
wasn't there a syringe in the box?
I feel awful.
do a line.
it's not the same.
use his stash to shoot up later.
I dumped it.
I couldn't get stopped with it. I have just enough for one fix.
I feel terrible. Let me go.
not just yet.
when? - Soon.
it's you they're after.
do you have a place to go?
you can come to mine, if you like.
get me home and I'll hide you.
they won't look for you there. My hubby's a cop.
you'll be safe. He works all night.
it would be funny, huh?
want some?
don't look.
follow me, please.
inspector...
your husband's more talkative.
we had a very interesting chat.
you're free to go.
what did you tell him?
nothing. That we'd stayed in every night this week.
that you came straight home after school.
that we watched TV all night.
what you should've told him.
I had no reason to tell him anything. You neither.
you'd still be there now.
as if I care! They had us under watch. Is that normal?
it wasn't normal for you to be there one more day.
it wasn't for you to talk.
it's not your affair. - You have a kid now.
your choices are his affair.
he missed you. He was confused.
what did you tell him?
you were at your mother's.
you lied to him.
I don't want lies. I'll tell him the truth.
you have no right.
some day, he'll find out.
someone will tell him, at school or football.
if we lied, he'll think I was guilty.
he'll feel guilty, too.
I don't want him feeling guilty of anything.
I've done nothing wrong.
I'm not so sure about that.
I don't care what you think.
come on...
wake up!
look at me...
you're at home. Don't be afraid...
you're at home now.
look at me...
everything's okay...
C'mon, stand up. On your feet...
hold onto me... Come on...
walk...
let me sleep. - No, you can't sleep...
help me, for Christ's sake.
keep going... Walk!
don't go to sleep...
that's right, keep your eyes open.
that's good...
can you see me?
can you hear me?
sit down but don't go to sleep.
hold on... Look at me...
now, talk... What's your name?
tell me your name. Can you remember?
see what he helped me avoid?
who?
my man.
he always gave me all the dope I needed.
since I met him, I never went cold turkey.
not once.
I'd forgotten.
15 years since I had to buy my own dope.
and this is the result.
he won't get any more?
Why?
do you know why?
can you get me some?
C'mon, help me.
what's your name?
Pierre.
thank you, Pierre.
my saviour.
go out first and cross the road so I can see you.
if the coast is clear, fine.
if there's anything unusual, head one way then double back, neither fast nor slow, just walking normally.
okay?
meet you at 2 in the car park.
I'll probably be driving an orange Audi.
very discreet.
watch how you go, matador.
hi there.
my meeting?
tonight, 11 pm. Place du Barlet.
will Jaquillat be there? - No, I will.
you pick me up and we go together.
tell me where to save time.
I don't know where it is. He'll guide us on my mobile.
just give it to me.
I can't trust you with my mobile!
if you don't do exactly as he said, no deal.
OK, we do it his way.
you got any dope?
don't pull a gun on me, I won't have any for a while.
he didn't like me knowing his name.
you got me in the shit, no mistake.
don't worry, in 3 days he'll forget.
see you tonight.
shit! You're fucking crazy.
sorry.
celebrating?
my release.
they grilled me all last night.
they beat you up?
course not.
I didn't talk.
anyway, you know nothing.
they stopped tailing you. Did you know?
it shows they believed you.
see that? Your pupils got behind you.
Yes, they're great.
try to get them to move. Encourage them.
pick out the good ones, I'll train them up.
are you kidding?
I'm not dragging my kids into all your crap.
it wasn't crap then.
well, now, I've changed my mind.
Jean-Jean's dead. Did you know?
why didn't you say?
I thought you didn't care.
you know he was shot in the back?
does it matter? You signed the Geneva convention?
are you saying it wasn't your fault?
if that's why you're here, I think I got the message.
it's not that. I know what I have to do.
I need a hand tonight.
it's important.
you won't be at risk. It's just back-up.
I said no. I'm not interested.
the world's changed in 20 years.
maybe we were right but it's over.
nothing has changed.
the same oppressors, same oppressed.
the world hasn't changed.
you have changed.
be strong, we can't give up now.
I'm not going anywhere with you. Never will.
I won't help you, won't hide you, won't write a tract. Don't even ask.
don't ask me for anything.
I'm all alone, Jeanne.
alone, they'll kill me.
why don't you go? I'll get you to ltaly.
we can leave right now. I'll do that, nothing else.
what is there for me in ltaly?
save your skin, that's the only thing worthwhile.
life's worth nothing. It's what you do with it.
save your slogans for someone else.
I won't come. I'm out of it. It's none of my business.
you believe that?
I'm meeting the shit who gave us away.
he didn't give me away. - He didn't know you.
and those who did kept their mouths shut.
wanna know what they did to Jean-Jean?
and André? And me? Do you?
why not? None of your business?
if we'd talked, you wouldn't have a kid to raise. Don't forget it.
you'll be there tonight.
for Jean-Jean and André. You owe them.
Jean-Jean's dead.
André's a thug. Prison is the only place for him.
take that back immediately.
I take back what I said. I apologize.
say you don't really think that.
I don't really think that.
that's okay.
I'll forget what you said. I'll pick you up at 10: 45.
it's my friend Cécile's.
I said I'd met a guy.
you'll be safe here.
the car's yours?
no, it's hers.
I'm going to need one with valid documents.
I have to get it back to her today.
no sweat, I'll find one.
I'll rent you one, if you like.
that's an idea.
I'll take care of it.
what do you think?
it's perfect.
don't lose it. I give hers back tonight.
don't worry.
where is he? - Let me explain.
no point. I know what's going on.
you've got it wrong.
I don't think I have.
Alain...
that's enough.
I know you're here.
I'm warning you. I won't budge until I've seen you.
don't force me to look in the closet.
you must be Cécile.
who are you? - Pierre.
you didn't say he was moving in.
it's temporary.
get out.
listen...
get out right now!
but he can't.
he's nowhere else to go.
he has no job, no welfare, nothing.
for months, he's had to beg.
tell that to Pascal. I'm sure he'll be delighted to offer him a bed.
now, out! Both of you.
you can't do this.
you'll use force?
come on.
what are we gonna do?
nothing.
you did the right thing.
stay calm.
she'll come to us.
I'm sorry.
I was a little...
you can stay here, of course.
it's ok, we'll look after you.
what time you got?
ten to.
me, too.
bang on time.
I'll go.
okay.
who was it?
it's Muriel.
she's run away again.
I'm not that stupid. Where are you going?
to fetch her.
I'll make up a bed.
no, I'll take her home.
don't wait up, I'll be some time.
drive.
what have you done? - You'll see in the paper.
you're okay. You didn't get hit.
whose blood is it?
don't ask.
you killed him?
I'm going. - No, stay put.
there's no point me staying.
maybe not. I need to think. Just do what I say.
steer clear of Rue de la Roche,
I"ll take care of the car, Make for ltaly, Good luck,
you can go.
how did you end up here?
owner's a well-wisher.
that's not true.
I know who the owner is.
she's a colleague of mine. It's not her style.
I know she's a colleague.
what do you think? The group stops at those you know?
there's many more you don't know.
we even have a mole in the police.
he keeps me informed.
tomorrow, I'll have a new car and then I'll blow up police HQ.
we've never been stronger.
the proletariat knows they'll always be exploited.
people are sick of it. They want change.
and it will change.
they lay off 1, 000 workers, we kill one of the bosses.
redundancy will become rarer.
we were 15 years too early but now the masses are ready.
there are no masses.
that's your problem.
you live in a world of individuals and individualism.
go see where Jean-Jean's mum lives.
the same problems as masses of others.
is her future brighter with Jean-Jean dead?
she knows why. she's proud of him.
I'm glad. Can the same be said of your victims?
they were class enemies.
3 firemen in Chambéry, a retired railworker in Lyon, 2 bank clerks in Vizille.
they're irrelevant! - Not to me!
they got in the way, okay?
no, not okay.
I want to know why they died. What for? I want you to tell me.
get out.
you're on your own.
you'll get yourself shot, all for nothing.
fuck off!
I was scared, Francis.
it's all over.
you're safe now.
come on...
where is he?
he killed again tonight.
it wasn't him.
were you there?
you don't know then.
he denied it.
the radio said otherwise.
the radio always takes the cops' side when the cops kill someone.
he's crazy. Completely crazy.
he's going to die and he's scared.
where is he?
no way.
Where's my daughter?
you startled me.
Where's my daughter? - I don't know.
she stole my car. I know it was to come here.
where is she?
I haven't seen anyone, I swear.
I don't believe you.
I know who you are.
you're not homeless.
you were never Agnès's lover. You're her dealer.
pretty amazed, huh? I know everything.
I know you're blackmailing Pascal.
did he tell you? - Mind your own business.
I haven't told him. I wouldn't want him to beat you up.
even so...
that's the least you deserve.
I'd be a tougher match than Agnès.
what are you saying? - He beats her.
you never noticed how violent he is?
you didn't wonder why she wore shades yesterday?
she should have said.
it's not easy to talk about.
he'd better not see me.
come with me, I'm scared.
I'll be watching.
keep nice and composed.
he's not here. It's empty.
I got it all wrong. Let's go.
having problems?
is that you?
don't be stupid.
alone? - What do you want?
I asked if you are alone.
okay, let's check.
hands in your pockets!
cool it.
I'll wait for Jeanne.
make me some food.
shut up! Not a word out of you!
for Christ's sake, what do you want?
do you want money? A car?
want me to get you across?
in 2 hours, we can be in ltaly.
we'll play it your way but my boy will be home soon.
I prefer to wait for him.
I've nothing against you.
but try that again and I won't think twice.
get cleaned up and we'll tidy the house.
hurry, they're here.
I'll keep the gun out of sight for the kid but don't try anything.
Hello, Mister. - Hello, young man.
did you cut yourself, Dad?
go play in your room.
get out!
calm down. - shut up!
he's right. Calm down. - You can't stay.
course not. We're leaving together in your car.
we won't make it. There are roadblocks all over.
they stop you?
I was with my son.
never. You hear me?
never.
think it over.
either we go together, with me under a blanket and the kid in the back, and in 10 minutes it's all over.
or I shoot you both and take the kid.
you wouldn't.
you'd bet your life on it?
you're wrong.
more?
where do I take you?
I'll tell you.
get up.
move to one side.
that'll do.
why are you slowing down?
there's a roadblock.
where are we?
Boulevard Mendès France.
be very careful what you do.
I swear I won't try anything.
promise you won't hurt the boy.
I can't speak for the cops.
what's going on?
that's fine.
we're through.
take Rue de sapporo.
we're on it.
all the way to the end and stop.
you see Rue d'lnnsbruck?
any cops around?
okay, I'm gone.
what the hell?
don't panic, it's the kids' safety.
you can relax. You'll never see me again.
okay?
I'll be right back.
what do you want?
can I come in?
I know where he is.
I'm just waiting for the boys.
no, don't worry.
there's nothing more to fear.
Yes, sweetheart.
big kiss.
I love you.
I need you to help me find my father. Do we have a deal?
the beans... they're gone.
this is how we're going to escape the destruction of Storybrooke.
there's a fail-safe built into the curse, a trigger.
Tamara... she's the "She" August was trying to warn us about.
it belonged to my mother, and I want it back.
the cuff.
they rigged it with something that blocks magic.
bag her.
there's something dark in your life. - My father.
I can send him someplace where he won't be able to use his powers... a place without magic.
what kind of world is without magic? - A better one.
we have to go through!
Papa, please, it's the only way we can be together!
no, Bae! I can't!
you coward! You promised! Don't break our deal!
I have to!
Papa! No!
Papa?
Papa?
Papa!
out of the road!
what is this place?
stop! Who are you? What do you want?
please, I-I don't mean any harm. I- I was just...
you're hungry.
here.
have as much as you'd like.
Really?
well, I'm not about to let you starve to death.
what's your name?
BAE. - Bae? How unusual.
I'm Wendy. Wendy Darling.
how about we sleep in just this once?
the marathon's in three weeks. I have to train.
come back to bed. I'll give you a workout.
I'll see you later.
okay. Bye.
no, no, no, you know perfectly... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No.
if you won't kiss it, you're gonna taste it anyway.
come on, Gold. I didn't do anything.
you stared at her, and I know how you think.
so kiss... My... Boots.
what the hell are you doing?
stand aside. This doesn't concern you.
no, go! - Let go of me, sir!
surprised you didn't turn him into a snail.
a-a snail? What are you... what are you talking about?
Lacey, uh, why don't you go and wait for me in the shop?
I'll be along shortly.
you're unreal, you know that?
you spent years looking for me. I come to town. You disappear.
haven't even bothered to meet Tamara.
why should I concern myself with her? - We're getting married!
that's never gonna last, not while you carry a torch for Emma.
you know, you haven't changed one bit.
for a second, I thought you might have.
I started to think maybe you were worth my time.
I guess I was wrong.
and yet you're still here.
for Henry. Not you.
as far as I'm concerned, you can stay the hell away from both of us.
it's okay! She's not here.
when you find her, you're not gonna hurt her, are you?
no. We just want the beans she stole from us. I don't get it.
why would Regina leave her office unlocked?
especially when she's keeping the beans here.
was keeping them here. They're gone.
something's not right. Regina would never leave evidence like this behind.
maybe she already used them to portal out of Storybrooke.
without Henry? I don't think so.
what if something bad happened to her?
security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6: 00 this morning.
they used an override code to get in.
why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?
she wouldn't.
you think someone else broke in and took the beans?
well, we haven't found Regina anywhere and haven't heard from her.
so something bad did happen to her.
we're gonna find her, Henry. I promise.
there's only one person who could overpower Regina.
he's too busy with his newold girlfriend.
no, this wasn't Gold.
this was Tamara.
haven't you already gone down that road? - Maybe not far enough.
or maybe it's time for you to let it go?
august was attacked the day Tamara came to town.
I don't think that was a coincidence.
what if you're wrong?
if Regina's in trouble, we can't just drop everything else because of a hunch.
which is why we're not gonna drop everything else. Go to Gold.
I'm sure he has some kind of magic that can help locate Regina.
where are you going? - Back to Tamara's room.
did you get into her office?
have I ever let you down?
look what I found.
are these what I think they are? - Magic beans.
Neal told me all about them. They open portals.
I bet he told you a lot, huh?
don't be jealous.
as soon as we're done, this is coming off.
Yeah, well, you can have this one instead.
what the hell is that? - I don't know.
Regina had it on her.
I'll send it back with the rest of the data.
I think the home office is gonna have a field day with everything we collected so far.
I still have one more thing that I have to do.
make it quick. We'll be getting our instructions soon.
Oh, this isn't gonna take long.
whatever they're offering you, it's not worth it.
well, considering they're offering to have me kill Rumplestiltskin, I'd say it is.
and you actually trust them?
you don't even know who you're working for.
good morning, Regina.
this part of your mission? - No.
no, this is... this is personal.
see, this... is about my father.
I already told you, he left town.
yet he never came to find his only son.
look, uh, would you mind lending me a hand?
and... preferably your good one.
sorry, mate. Gonna have to say no.
when you're interested in killing Rumplestiltskin and not torturing the queen, find me.
well, I guess it's just me and you.
is that supposed to frighten me?
well... it should.
you see, this is how we deal... with your kind.
and, yes, it's going to be... unpleasant.
now... exactly how unpleasant...
well... That depends... on you.
now...
where is my father?
I brought as much as I could.
and your parents don't suspect anything?
they're grown-ups. They can't see anything that's not right in front of them.
we can't, can we?
please, father. Let me explain.
how long have you been hiding in my house?
only a few weeks, father. He was hungry on the streets.
I was talking to him. Where's your family?
my mother died.
my father...
he's dead, too.
look, I'm sorry. I-I'll leave right away, sir.
you're not going anywhere.
the streets are no place for a boy.
please, don't send me to the workhouse.
we'll do nothing of the sort.
you'll stay... right here.
what? - Welcome to our home.
I need to search your room. For real this time.
you wanna tell me what this is about, sheriff?
Where's your fiancee?
she's... on a run. What do you think she did this time?
Regina's gone missing.
and you think she...
you're... you're still on Tamara? You gotta be kidding me.
she came to town to support me, her fiance. She's not a kidnapper.
Where'd she go running?
the same place she goes every morning... the woods.
how long she been gone? - Couple of hours.
does it matter? She's training for a marathon.
if she runs in the woods, then why did she track sand in here?
maybe she likes to run along the beach instead. What does that prove?
that she lied to you.
if she lied about this, then you can bet she's lied about other things, too.
maybe she just likes to run on the beach.
one way to find out.
BAE. Come to the window.
what is it?
the shadow? Is it coming tonight?
Oh, I hope so.
the... What?
a few weeks ago, right about the time you got here, this...shadow... it came to the window, only it's not attached to a body.
and it can do so many wonderful things like...
like change its shape and fly and travel between worlds.
and do you know why?
because it has magic.
whatever you do, promise me you'll never open that window again.
promise me you won't talk to the shadow.
don't be silly. - Magic is dangerous.
it always comes with a price.
you're just saying that 'cause you don't believe.
no. I do believe.
that's the point. I've seen magic.
I come from another land... A-a land where magic is everywhere.
is that really true?
because that sounds wonderful. - It isn't what you think.
magic is the reason I left.
I lost everything because of it.
your mother and father.
magic destroyed my family.
I don't want it to do the same to yours.
if the shadow comes back, promise me you won't go anywhere near it.
all right, Bae. I promise.
sorry to interrupt the party.
well, I certainly don't remember inviting you two. We're closed.
not to us. We need your help.
Regina's missing, and we think she might be in danger.
just the way I like her. Now if you'll excuse me...
no, I don't think so.
whatever your feelings are about Regina, you still owe me a favor.
Lacey, if you could excuse us, I have some business to attend to.
make it quick.
I'm sure I could whip up something to find Regina, but tell me, why do the Charmings want to help the evil queen?
because I owe her, after what I did to Cora.
never underestimate the power of a guilty conscience.
what is that?
this is one of Regina's tears.
why do you have one of Regina's tears?
because I do.
this spell, however, requires two tears.
you want one from me?
well, just think of a dark moment, dearie... something bleak and hopeless.
I know you have a few.
perfect.
now... when you drop this into your eye, you will be connected with Regina, wherever she is.
whatever she sees, you'll see. Whatever she feels, you'll feel.
how long does the spell last?
long enough to lead you to her.
and with that, I've fulfilled my end of the bargain. Good-bye.
always a pleasure.
so it's, uh... so it's true?
I-I-I heard everything.
you, uh...
you really can do magic.
I think you might wanna pour yourself another drink.
you don't have to do this, you know.
you've been through enough already.
that's why I do have to do it.
my heart is dark because of what I did to Regina.
if I can help find her, if we could save her, maybe it'll help let some of the light back in.
BAE! Look! It's him, the shadow.
no. No, Wendy, get away from there.
you don't have to be afraid. He doesn't want to hurt us.
he's from another land...a land with magic, but it's different from where you came from.
Wendy, please, don't listen to him.
it's called Neverland, and there are grown-ups there, and children never grow old.
and we can do anything we want, even fly!
it's a trick. Don't go with him.
you don't need magic. You have a family right here. That's the only thing that matters.
this is what I've always dreamed of. You just don't believe.
so, uh, where do you think she's hiding Regina... a sand castle?
they have to be somewhere.
Emma, you're letting your emotions get in the way of your judgment.
do you really think this is all about me trying to break up you and Tamara?
what do you wanna hear, Neal?
that it killed me you never came looking for me even once I was locked up?
that it didn't hurt that you found Tallahassee with someone else?
what are you doing down here?
we were... we were just... I thought you go running in the woods.
Yeah, I start in the woods, but then I run along the beach.
everything all right? - Regina's missing.
Oh, my god. That's terrible.
I thought maybe she was down here, but I was wrong.
well, I'm sure she'll turn up somewhere.
let me know if I can help at all.
I'll see you later. - Okay.
Oh, Emma. - I think I should go.
I wanted to go to jail for you.
Neal... - It kills me that I let August talk me into letting you go.
I don't wanna hear it. - No, okay, but I have to say it.
I wanted to look for you.
I just... I was too afraid.
of what?
that you would never forgive me, 'cause I never forgave myself.
there hasn't been a day that's gone by...
that I don't regret having left you.
I'm sorry, Emma, for everything.
me, too.
everything's taken care of.
they bought it?
as far as Emma and Neal are concerned, I'm just running on the beach.
how are things going with the Queen?
you know, she's not exactly cooperative, but that's all about to change. Right, Regina?
you have no... idea who you're dealing with.
actually, no, you have no idea who you're dealing with.
a couple of fools in over their heads who go around stealing magic.
stealing magic.
that's what you think we're here to do?
we're not here to steal magic.
we're here to destroy it.
magic does not belong in this world. It's unholy.
we're here to cleanse this land of it.
you think you can destroy magic?
just the two of you?
well, who said there's only two of us?
Oh, we're... we're everywhere, Regina.
see, after I left Storybrooke as a boy,
I was babbling about magic, about what I had seen, and what had happened to my father.
you know, most folks, they... they wrote me off.
but some didn't.
and they found me.
they"?
believers.
people that know that magic is real.
and that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.
this little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic...
it's not gonna work.
no, of course it will.
we've done it before, and we'll do it again.
do... do you think that Storybrooke is the first time that magic has crossed over?
magic has been doing it's damage for a long time.
and people like us...
we're here to stop it.
Mary Margaret? Are you okay?
it was awful. The worst pain I've ever felt.
wherever Regina is, she's powerless. She can't fight back.
could you... could you see where she was? Could you see who was keeping her there?
I just remember...
pain... and screaming.
okay, okay. Okay.
concentrate.
the smallest detail might lead us to her.
I don't know. Oh, my hands were tied down.
and my legs...
it was cold and...
it smelled weird, like... sardines.
I don't know. I wish I could remember more.
so she didn't see anything?
uh, not much. She could sense Regina was in pain. It was cold.
she was strapped down.
uh, she said she could smell sardines.
get down to the docks right now.
I was right. Tamara was not down here for a run.
she was in there... with Regina.
it's all right. It's just me.
I thought I'd never see you again.
how long was I gone?
just... the night.
it felt like so much longer.
as though time works differently in Neverland.
so... what was it like over there?
it's an island where there are no grown-ups to tell you what to do.
but there are mermaids and fairies and all sorts of mystical creatures.
then... why did you return?
because... when night fell...
that's when all the children started to miss their parents, and they cried through the night.
well, why don't they go home?
the shadow won't let them.
there's a reason it's called neverland.
because once you set foot on its soil...
the shadow never lets you leave.
h-how did you escape? - He let me go.
because he didn't want me.
he wanted a boy.
he's coming back tonight to take one of my brothers in my place.
you said magic was bad, and you were right, Bae.
it's going to destroy my family. - No.
I won't let anything bad happen to you or this family.
so why didn't you tell me sooner?
because magic always comes with a price.
tends to drive away the people I care about most.
well, then you've been caring about the wrong people.
what else can you do?
anything.
there are many perks... to being the dark one.
immortality being one of them, right?
could you, uh... Could you keep me young?
Yeah.
cause, uh...
cause then we can... we can be together forever.
nothing can keep us apart.
what?
there is one thing.
what is it?
immortal means to live forever. It doesn't mean one can't be killed.
there was a prophecy that...
someone... might be my undoing.
well... well, do... do you know who this someone is?
then... then get rid of them. Stop them.
it's complicated.
something's standing in my way.
I thought you were a man who... who wouldn't let anything stand in his way.
I am.
you sure you wanna be here?
I'm not gonna leave you alone in this place.
if something does go down with Tamara, I need to know you've got my back.
Emma, if Tamara is hiding Regina here in her evil lair by the docks, yeah, I got your back.
what the hell, guys? - Here.
so that doesn't happen again.
you and Mary Margaret take the basement. We'll search the main floor.
Regina's gotta be here somewhere.
time to go.
they found us.
who, Emma and Neal?
I thought that you took care of them.
Yeah, so did I. We need to go.
no, no. No, no, no. I-I need more time with her.
Greg, if you get caught, this whole thing is blown.
we wouldn't even know about this town if it wasn't for my dad.
I'm not leaving until I find out where he is.
fine.
meet me at the rendezvous point when you're done.
I'm moving up the timeline.
now I'm gonna give you one last chance.
tell me where my father is.
okay, time's up. - Wait.
where is he?
dead.
I killed him. The minute you ran away...
no, you're... you're lying to me.
don't believe me? Go see for yourself.
I buried his body at your campsite.
I doubt he gets many visitors there.
now go ahead and kill me.
I just wanted to see the look on your face when I...
good night, my treasures.
we have work to do.
okay. Don't worry.
the shadow's not taking anyone tonight.
thank you, Bae.
you can thank me in the morning.
okay, everyone to their beds.
BAE? - Don't be frightened.
the shadow... he's here.
get in the crawl space! Come on! Let's go!
Where's Michael? - Michael?
don't do it! Don't go with him!
Michael. Michael, step back.
you want him? Take me instead.
bae, no!
but you have to promise never to bother this family again.
no, Bae, you can't.
I won't let magic destroy this family. This is the only way.
you have to let me go.
thank you, Wendy, for making me part of your family.
you feel that?
that's the end of you.
that's scary, ain't it?
now you're never gonna hurt anyone ever again.
don't move!
David! We can't leave her.
she'll die if we don't get her help.
we gotta get her to Mother superior.
Emma? You gotta block the exits.
already on it. You guys all right?
Oh, we're fine. We found Regina, with Mendell. He's coming your way.
so I was right. It wasn't Tamara.
actually...
it was.
I just had some help.
what are you doing, Tamara?
I have to keep magic out of this world, Neal.
it doesn't belong here.
you more than anyone should understand that. It's a poison.
you've been lying to me.
how long have you been lying to me?
this is more important than any... - How long?!
since the beginning. Since I spilled coffee on you.
it wasn't an accident.
you planned it all. None of it was real.
Neal, you're a good man. I know that.
so please try to understand.
I had a job to do...an important one, one I think you can agree with.
you never loved me.
no.
I can't let you leave here, Tamara. - Neal, please don't make me.
I'm sorry, Neal. - You should be.
it's over.
no. It's not.
Bye.
I got you.
we gotta get you to a hospital.
you can't hold both of us! - I'm not letting go of you.
you have to. - No, you're shot!
if you fall through that portal, you'll die no matter what world you land in!
no, but, Emma, Henry needs you. He can't lose both of us.
don't make him grow up like we did.
then don't let go.
I need you.
I love you.
I love you too.
No!
no, no, no, no, no, no.
no.
dad.
now that the cuff is off, she's gonna be okay, Given time and rest.
her magic will return.
what happened?
what is it?
Where's Neal?
he's gone.
she killed him.
Neverland?
No! No, you're not taking me there!
good, lad. Get the sea out of your lungs.
who are you?
the name's Hook. Captain Hook.
welcome aboard th "Jolly Roger," My boy.
I'm so sorry.
how... am I gonna tell Henry?
you...
you saved me? - Yes.
you really think we'd let you die?
despite our differences, we're family.
where are they?
where are Greg and Tamara?
they got away.
so they still have it.
still have what?
sorry about your father.
me, too.
do the folks back at the home office know anything about it?
Yeah. They did.
and you're never gonna believe what it does.
a trigger?
that will destroy Storybrooke. - No.
I had a fail-safe built into the curse.
then why exactly were you carrying it around?
she was gonna destroy us, Mary Margaret.
I was going to use the beans to take Henry back to the enchanted forest.
and in the process, kill all of us.
you wanna discuss justification?
you were going to abandon me.
or shall we discuss the more pressing issue?
which is that I no longer control the trigger.
what are we supposed to do with it?
they want us to move to the next phase.
already? - Yeah.
there's only one way to get what we all want.
we have to blow Storybrooke off the map.
Milah was quite beautiful, wasn't she?
don't worry, cap'n. You'll avenge her.
no matter what it takes, I know you'll find a way to kill Rumplestiltskin.
Mr. Smee, what news of the day's catch?
the boy we yanked from the sea.
he's still asleep.
a bit waterlogged and smells of catfish, but he'll live.
where do you suppose he came from? Hmm?
there aren't many other ships in the area, and his clothes are certainly not of this land.
what if the boy belongs to him?
the ones he kidnaps from the other world.
I-I'd bet my rations on it.
indeed.
but could we be so lucky?
lucky?
he'll be looking for us.
he knows this land better than we do.
Mr. Smee...
are you not a connoisseur of rare and valuable objects?
if we return the boy to him, it could be the very key to our survival in Neverland.
ahoy there.
aren't you lucky to be alive?
lucky?
I'm a prisoner of pirates in a land cursed with magic.
well, most children think they've found paradise when they lay their eyes on Neverland's magic.
why else leave home the first place?
I came here so a family I loved could live.
well, aren't you quite the hero?
what would you know about that? Pirate.
a pirate saved your scrawny bones from the curse of the mermaids.
a pirate killed my mother and tore apart my family.
what about your father?
he left me.
he's a coward.
what's your name, boy?
I don't have to answer you.
well, I can make you.
but to prove that not all pirates are as you fear,
I'll simply ask again.
what's your name?
welcome aboard, Baelfire.
it's a pirate's life for you.
what are you doing here?
well, my son made it clear I'm to stay away from him, so... I'm spending some time with my grandson instead.
Mr. Gold, we have some news we need to share with you, and it's not good.
not interested.
it's about your son.
Yeah. What about him?
Tamara shot him.
what?
he's dead?
they used a bean to open a portal.
Neal was hurt so badly, he fell through.
he's gone.
bae wasn't supposed to die.
Greg and Tamara... they took something from Regina...
a magical trigger.
a fail-safe in the curse that can destroy Storybrooke.
if they activate it, it's a self-destruct.
everyone not born in this world will die.
I know this is hard, but we need your help.
no.
they killed your son in cold blood, and you don't wanna stop them?
they didn't kill my son.
I did.
I brought magic to this world to find Bae.
and now he's dead.
magic always has a price, and this... this is it.
but I'm prepared to pay it.
but... we'll die. You'll die.
no, I've made my peace with that.
it's just ahead.
you sure whoever's in charge of you guys doesn't want you to die in a mine collapse?
just keep moving.
who is telling you what to do?
you know what? That's not your concern.
it's not ours, either.
not your concern?
so you're telling me you don't know who commands you?
unlike you, Hook, we believe in something.
we have faith in the sacredness of our cause.
we're here.
so your sacred cause is pilfering a dwarf's pickaxe?
Regina... had this in her pocket when you turned her over to us.
it's a trigger, and this axe, according to our people, is what activates it.
you're going to destroy an entire town and kill everyone in it...
Yeah, including your enemy.
Rumplestiltskin won't be immune to this?
none of your kind will be.
once this thing gets activated, nothing can shut it off.
this whole town will revert to the forest it was.
so tell us, Hook.
we're willing to die for our cause.
are you willing to die for yours?
Absolutely.
Storybrooke - Oh! Henry. - Mom!
Regina, was that...
Yes. The diamond was activated.
so we're all gonna die.
you were born here, so you'll live.
but...
I'll be alone.
I'm so sorry, Henry. - It's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna let it.
you did this. Now make it stop. - I can't. There's no way.
well, figure it out. It's your fault.
stop! I already lost my dad. I don't wanna lose anyone else.
we have to work together.
from the mouths of babes. I'd say the lad has a point.
that's for the last time we met. - Bloody hell.
and tell us why you're here before I use something else other than my fist.
I think threatening to kill me is a bit redundant when we're all about to die anyway.
no thanks to you. Regina just told us you were working with
Tamara and Greg to get your revenge.
well, that was before they told me I had to die to get it.
we don't have time for this. We have a real problem.
which is why I'm here, 'cause staring death in the face has made me realize if there's one thing I want more than my revenge, it's my life.
so should we start this thing now and then resume bickering?
there is no stopping it.
and the best thing I can do is slow it down, but that will only delay the inevitable.
it'll give us the time we need.
the time for what?
steal back the beans.
use them to get everyone back into the Enchanted Forest before Storybrooke is gone.
how? We don't know where Greg and Tamara are.
well, I do. I can help.
help yourself. You'll take them and leave us all behind. Why should we trust you?
no, we won't have to. I'll go with him.
if he tries anything, I'll shoot him in the face.
quite hostile, aren't we? - Just being clear.
I'll take Regina to slow down the diamond, give you guys time.
Mary Margaret, take Henry. Gather everyone.
make sure they're ready to go as soon as we have those beans.
Henry, before you go...
I'm sorry for what's happened.
I... tried to be the person that you wanted me to be, and I failed.
but I won't let you be alone.
you just know that I love you.
I love you, too.
the things we do for our children.
captain, you have to give them the boy.
they've killed for less.
the sooner we give them what they want, the sooner they leave us alone.
no. I can't part with him now, not when I know he's The Dark One's son.
can't be chance that brought him here.
providence must be at work.
he is the key to my revenge.
I won't lose him.
do you know who we are?
you're the lost ones. You work for him.
we're looking for a boy who was seen adrift nearby.
a boy he has a particular interest in.
then I'm afraid I have to send you away disappointed.
as you can see, we're only men here.
then you won't mind if we search your ship.
be my guest.
told you, no one here but me crew.
you're new to this land, which means I should warn you.
do you know what he does to people who lie to him?
no.
but I gather it hurts.
it does.
he rips your shadow right from your body.
if you find him, you know who he belongs to.
good-bye, captain.
I thought pirates only cared about themselves.
well, you have a lot to learn, boy.
a sure sign of impending doom.
looters.
it ain't looting if the stuff you find's already yours.
we need Sneezy's drinking stein. We can bring his memories back.
Oh, can you?
mother Superior finally figured it out.
he needs to drink this out of his old stein... something important to him.
so she found a solution to the memory problem? Today?
in the nick of time before we all die?
die? Who's dying?
she's been working on it all along.
then when she had to transform August back to Pinocchio, she found the ingredient she needed.
a hair from Pinocchio's head.
someone who returned to who he should be... someone who wasn't cursed.
so you're gonna wake your friend up to tell him he's about to die?
I don't want that. - Shut it, Clark.
he wants to know who he is and be with his family, no matter how much time he has left.
not if I'm gonna die.
let's take him back to Granny's. - Do it there.
Hey. Hey, guys.
if I don't have a family, will I still die?
you know, I really don't think it's necessary, you know, to go through this.
I asked her to make a second dose.
this is for you.
well, what am I supposed to do with that?
belle once helped remind me who I was.
I've never forgotten.
I wanna return the favor.
don't let her die as Lacey.
what... what was all that about?
Oh, that was nothing.
over there. Let's go.
time's running out.
Oh, is that what that means?
your sea legs aren't bad for a landlubber.
Yeah, but I still get queasy.
Oh, it'll pass.
just think of yourself as an extension of the ship.
do you care to try a hand at the helm?
I know nothing of sailing.
Oh, once you get your bearings, it's as easy as pie.
now...
the left side is called "port.
and the right side is called "starboard.
now...
go two notches to port.
well done, mate. You were born with the sea in your blood.
Thanks.
you spoke of your mother's fate, but your father... what became of him?
you say he left you?
it's a long story.
it's one that I know well.
when I was a boy, my father and I boarded a ship with plans to travel the realms.
one morning, I awoke, and he was gone.
turned out he was a fugitive.
he had fled in the middle of the night to avoid capture.
he abandoned you?
Aye.
that he did.
if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell the crew?
they might become frightened.
my father... the reason why I don't speak of him is because... he's The Dark One.
he once was a man, but when I got drafted to the ogre wars, he wanted to protect me.
so he went in search of The Dark One's dagger.
and once he got it, he grew obsessed with the power it gave him.
he draws his power from a dagger?
Yes. It's the only weapon that can kill him.
and the only thing he truly cares about anymore.
he chose it over me.
my papa abandoned me, too.
so, tell me, Hook, all this time, it's been about revenge for you?
why is that suddenly so important to you that you survive?
I know what I'm fighting for... my family.
what are you fighting for?
myself.
that's plenty of motivation, I can assure you.
quiet.
the beans... give 'em to me.
you mean these?
No! Come on. We got what we need.
what are you doing? They've got the beans!
not all of them. I snagged one.
where are the rest?
who cares? All we need is one.
Hey! Live to fight another day, mate.
I'm not your mate.
I can feel it. It's like the oxygen's being sucked out of the air.
not the oxygen. The magic.
there it is.
once it stops glowing, its destruction is achieved, and then...
well, then we'll see the real carnage.
I'll try to contain its energy as long as I can.
it won't be long. We'll have the bean soon.
then we can get the hell out of here.
slowing the device...
it's going to require all the strength I have.
you're not coming with us, are you?
when you said good-bye to Henry, you... were saying good-bye.
he knows I love him, doesn't he?
Regina, no, there has gotta be another way.
you were right, you know.
everything that's happening... it's my fault.
I created this device.
it's only fitting that it takes my life.
what am I supposed to tell Henry?
tell him that in the end, it wasn't too late for me to do the right thing.
Regina, please...
everyone looks at me as the Evil Queen, including my son.
I may die as Regina.
Mr. Gold
to the end of the world.
come on. It'll help numb it.
I'll, uh, I'll drink to that.
Oh. I'm... I'm so sorry.
uh, here. I got it. I got it. Sorry.
S-stop. Stop. Put that down. - It's just an old rag.
it belonged to someone very important. You wouldn't understand.
I said I'm sorry.
that cup again.
what is it?
it's something from my past...
from our past.
and I'm sorry.
let's not fight.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna wake you up to die.
but I needed you.
you lost your son.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've failed.
I've failed.
we have the beans. - All right.
you did it? - Yeah.
you okay? - Oh, it's... grazed. It's fine.
okay, let's get going. Henry?
W-where's my mom?
Regina can hold off the self-destruct device long enough for us to escape, but...
but what?
she won't survive.
no. No.
Henry, I'm sorry. I promised her I'd get you to safety.
but we can't do this. She's family.
we don't leave family behind.
I know, but this is what she wants. We have a way out. We have to take it.
we saved her from being killed by the wraith.
how is this any different?
the wraith. - What?
we sent it through a portal.
why can't we do the same thing with the self-destruct?
because we don't know if it's going to work.- It could.
Yeah.
it's too risky. No one will go along with it.
Yes, we will.
because it's the right thing to do.
look, Snow White and The Prince have always led us before, and we've always won.
so... who's willing to let them lead us again?
you can count on us. - Me.
always. - Me.
thank you, Archie.
Oh, this is what we should do. - And will do.
I know we haven't had a lot of chances to be parents, but give us this one.
let us do the right thing. It's not too late.
I just don't want him to be alone.
I don't want him to grow up the way I did.
this plan could fail.
if we use that bean now, we can get away for sure.
we will survive. - But it's wrong.
Emma, I killed her mother. - You did that to Cora because you had to.
I did it because it was easy.
it was a mistake. There were other paths...
harder paths, and I wish I had taken them.
so please, Emma, honey...
let's take the hard path.
because if we don't, we will be building a future on Regina's blood.
okay.
you're all mad.
I can live with myself. - Give it back.
if she wants to die for us, I say let her.
you and I... we understand each other.
look out for yourself, and you'll never get hurt, right?
worked quite well for me.
Yeah, till the day that it doesn't.
we're doing this. It might be stupid. It might be crazy, but we're doing it.
so... you can join us and be a part of something, or you can do what you can do best and be alone.
quite passionate, Swan.
why are you really doing this?
the kid just lost his father today.
I'm not letting him lose a mother, too.
his father?
who's Henry's father?
Yeah.
captain...
why is Baelfire still aboard the "Jolly Roger"?
the boy has given you a path to revenge, but you can't walk that path if you're dead.
careful, Smee.
captain, you know quite well that he is after the boy.
if you don't surrender Baelfire to him, the... the lost ones will take him anyway and kill you.
I'm the captain. I give the orders!
and anyone who disobeys can walk the plank and pray the mermaids take pity on his soul!
face me, villain?
captain!
what's this about, Bae?
I found this... on your desk.
it's... it's my mother.
how'd you get it?!
BAE... - How?!
you're the pirate that killed her!
I didn't kill your mother.
we fell in love.
and we ran off together.
your father lied to you.
he was too much of a coward to tell you the truth.
he tore her heart out and crushed it in front of me.
and I've spent every moment since then wanting revenge.
she abandoned me?
not a single day went past when your mother didn't regret leaving you, Baelfire.
we talked about going back for you when you were old enough.
perhaps fate brought us together so that I can make good on those plans.
we can live the life that Milah wanted for us, - as a family. - No! Stay back.
you used me!
you wanted to kill my father!
Yes. I did.
you tore apart my family, as sure as if you'd ripped her heart out yourself.
bae, don't. - Take me back to my real family, the Darlings.
uh, I can't.
it's not possible to leave Neverland.
but you could stay here under my protection.
I'd rather fend for myself than be with you.
I want off this ship...
pirate.
what are you doing here?
you were willing to die to save us. That makes you a hero.
and now we're gonna be heroes.
we're gonna open up a portal, throw this thing into a void.
no. You don't know that it'll work.
we have to try.
everybody, step aside.
it's empty.
hook.
eager to go, I see.
just drop me off anywhere.
you really think you can survive on your own?
I've never been given the choice.
well, you have one now.
anywhere will do.
I get you're angry.
but it doesn't have to end like this.
this ship can be your home, your family.
just say the word.
it's not too late to start over.
I can change, Bae... for you.
you say that. I know you'll never change.
because all you care about is yourself.
thank you...
for reminding me what I'm all about.
killing your father.
you're not letting me go.
how would that help me?
you hated my father so much, you didn't even realize you were just like him!
you have the boy.
he will be pleased?
I can't contain this much longer.
mom...
dad...
I love you, Henry.
I only wish I was strong enough to stop all this.
I'm just not.
you may not be strong enough.
but maybe we are.
we're alive.
we did it.
Yes, we did.
gotta hand it to Henry. He's right about a lot of things.
Yes, he is.
isn't that right, kid?
Emma, what is it?
they took him.
relax, kid. We're not gonna hurt you.
just everyone I love. You tried to blow up Storybrooke.
true, but that was never the point.
it wasn't?
we came here to destroy magic, Henry, but then we found something more important...
something that changed everything.
you.
Emma, you don't even know where you're going!
doesn't matter. I have to find him.
I'll track them down in hell if I have to.
the last bean.
they've opened a portal.
No! No! No!
we have to follow them! There has to be a way.
not only do we not know where they went, - but Hook stole the last bean. - I don't care!
without it, there's no way to follow. - There has to be.
we can't let them just take Henry. - They've taken Henry?
Yeah. You're The Dark One. Do something.
gold, help us.
there's no way.
I spent a lifetime trying to cross worlds to find my son.
there's no way in this world without a portal.
so that's it? He's gone forever?
I refuse to believe that.
what is that?
what the hell are you doing here?
helping.
well, you're too late.
am I?
I thought you didn't care about anyone but yourself.
maybe I just needed reminding that I could.
enough waiting around. Let's go.
go? Where? I thought we were saving the town.
we already did.
we need to get Henry. Greg and Tamara took him through a portal.
well, I offer my ship and my services to help follow them.
well, that's great, Hook, but how will we track them?
leave that to me.
I can get us where we need to go.
then let's do it.
belle, I-I-I have to go.
you have to stay here.
no. W-why? I-I wanna help.
the town is no longer safe.
what? - What?
well, Greg and Tamara weren't working alone. Others will follow.
no. We can't leave people in danger.
after we've gone, follow these instructions.
it's a cloaking spell.
it'll shield the town, making it impossible for anyone to find.
well, then how will you find your way back to me?
you're not coming back, are you?
the prophecy.
the boy is my undoing.
but he's also my grandson.
I must save him.
I must do this to honor Baelfire.
he's gone.
and I didn't even get the chance to say good-bye.
I understand, but I also know...
that the future isn't always what it seems.
I will see you again.
Baelfire would be... very proud of you.
who is he?
I don't know.
is he alive?
barely. We have to get him help.
help me get him up.
so... are you done trying to kill me?
I believe so.
excellent.
then you can live.
where is that?
where did they take Henry?
Neverland.
is it the boy? The one he wants?
no, it's not.
it's your lucky day, boy. You get to live.
put him with the rest.
so who are we up against?
who are Greg and Tamara?
they're merely pawns, manipulated by forces far greater than they can conceive.
they have no idea who they're truly working for.
and who's that?
someone we all should fear.
if that's not the boy he's looking for, you think we'll be able to find him?
of course we will.
may take time, but...
Peter Pan never fails.
soon I will have what I want. A family that loves me.
sometimes, ordinary objects can come to possess their own special kind of magic.
I'm ready to make that deal. I want my ribbons back.
I'm no longer convinced you have anything I want.
you want what all villains want.
everything.
every dark one tries.
every one fails.
you will never collect enough power to do what you want.
Oh, I will. But, alas, you won't be there to see it.
if you truly want to save Marian...
you're gonna have to forget about me.
you were planning to use this to strip away her magic.
no, that's not why I had it.
the family that you think you have...
they may love you...
keep your distance. I don't want to hurt anyone.
but they also fear you. - Let me go!
did you find her?
no. We looked everywhere.
she doesn't want to be found.
I know who you are.
and I can be of no help to you.
no, of course not.
you're an errand boy long past his prime.
I wish to speak to the one you work for.
there are many who desire an audience with the sorcerer, but he speaks only through his apprentice.
then tell him, apprentice,
I wish to make a deal.
the sorcerer does not make petty deals, especially with those who have succumbed to the darkness...
like you.
I think in this case, he might make a small exception.
we'll see.
I have his hat.
you have no idea the forces you are dealing with.
tell me where it is.
Oh. No.
did you think that I was foolish enough to bring it with me?
the hat is hidden far away.
and unless he gives me what I want, the sorcerer will never see his hat again.
and what is it that you so desire?
happiness.
the kind I haven't known in a long time...
since I was a little girl, running in a field with my sisters, chasing a kite.
our love made us strong.
until it didn't.
my sisters could never accept who I was because they were... ordinary.
I want two new sisters, born with magic, like me.
my niece, Elsa, will be joining me.
we need a third magical sister...
a perfect match.
a match like that will be extremely hard to come by.
it could take time.
tell the sorcerer I am a very patient woman.
I am willing to wait as long as it takes to find a perfect sister.
okay.
okay, come on. Calm down.
mom?
Henry, what are you doing here?
I've been out all night looking for you.
everyone has. - I told them all to stay away.
I can't control my powers right now.
listen, don't worry about me.
I'm gonna find a way to fix this, but until I do...
you got to go. - No.
you always think that pulling away from people will fix your problems, but it never does.
I can help you.
Henry, just wait. I...
Henry, are you okay?
you okay?
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
is that a cut? Henry, what did I do?
I-it's fine. I'm okay.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
mom.
stop! Please, don't come any closer.
I love you, kid, but you got to go.
just go!
I know exactly how you feel...
seeing the fear in his eyes.
you are out of control.
but, Emma, you're not going to hurt me.
nor should you. I'm on your side.
just leave me the hell alone.
you can run, but it won't help.
the only way this ends is you embracing who you are.
if it means hurting people I love, no, thanks.
mm, good morning.
well, look who's finally woken up.
I apologize, but, uh, that was the best...
sleep I've had in a very long time.
how would you like to come back to my camp...
and let me cook you breakfast?
Ohh, that sounds lovely, but we both know we can't do that.
Yeah, you're probably right.
little John is a bit of a gossip.
there it is.
there's that elusive but satisfying smile
I think about every time I close my eyes.
this makes me wonder why we didn't do this a few decades ago.
I think you were suffering from a bit of heartbreak and a touch of self-loathing.
and I was just some drunk in a bar with a tattoo.
who tinker bell said I was destined to be with.
I should have listened to that stupid fairy.
things might have turned out differently had I chosen you over...
well, instead of...
evil. - Hmm.
you made mistakes.
and now you're making up for them.
or digging myself in deeper.
you're married.
I know.
even if there wasn't a Marian
I'm certain this would end badly.
are you really that much of a pessimist?
well, you would be, too, if you knew everything I did.
have you seen this before?
no.
it's a magical storybook, which we're all written into.
and there's me, walking away from you at the bar.
where did this come from?
I don't know.
it just appeared when Henry needed it most, full of stories about heroes and villains.
guess which column I'm in.
this book is about the past.
like you said, you're not the evil queen anymore.
tell that to the author because he seems to have made it a rule that villains don't get happy endings, even if they change, even if they try to be good.
point him to me.
I'll be happy to have more than a conversation.
I wish it were that simple, but I don't know where he is or who he is or if it's a he or a she or an it.
I've searched everywhere, and I've been failing.
Regina, let me help.
you can't.
and this...
cannot happen a second time.
you understand?
I know.
but...
if we don't leave this room, then I think that this still...
this counts as the first time, doesn't it?
you'd think a big yellow driving machine would be easier to find.
perhaps she doesn't want to be found, since, you know, that's what she bloody told us.
well, the good news is thanks to the ice wall, Emma can't leave town.
the longer she isolates herself, the worse it'll get.
her magic will just keep spiraling.
Elsa's right. This was a bad idea coming home.
we should still be out there searching.
Hey, this isn't your fault.
it isn't.
we'll find Emma, but we've been searching all night.
everyone's exhausted, yourself included.
so we refuel, we regroup.
and we go out, and we find our daughter, okay?
okay.
you don't have to look anymore.
Henry. We thought you were asleep upstairs.
we told you to stay here. What happened?
I snuck out, okay? I'm sorry, but I found her.
how is she? Is she okay? Is she hurt?
she's out in the woods.
I thought I could help calm her down, but when I showed up, it just made things worse.
come with me. I'll clean you up in the bathroom.
this is bad news.
if anyone can calm her down, it's Henry.
when your powers are out of control, everything's upside down.
you don't want to be anywhere near the people you care about.
wonderful. Well, shall we send Sneezy after her, then?
or happy? Which is the dwarf she despises?
I was so scared that I would hurt Ana until I finally realized you can't run away from the people who love you because, in the end, they're the only ones who can help you.
hurry, I want everything ready before Ana arrives.
uh, chocolate fondue goes there.
chocolate toast, chocolate julekake.
and chocolate ice cream.
or is ice cream too obvious? Should we lose the ice cream?
Oh, Ana, don't come in yet. I haven't got everything ready.
I'm afraid Ana won't be at dinner tonight.
something quite terrible has happened.
could you leave please?
it's all right. We'll finish later.
what is it?
this will be hard to understand, but Ana, she hasn't been entirely honest with you.
she didn't come back from Misthaven empty-handed.
she found the thing your parents were looking for.
which was...?
a magical hat to take away your powers, to cure you of the very thing that makes you special.
so that's why they left on that boat.
but why would Ana hide that from me?
because your dear sister was planning to use it on you.
no, she would never. She tried it on me first.
fortunately, I stopped her.
she's in the dungeon, awaiting your royal judgment.
Oh, there must be some misunderstanding. She called me a monster.
I'm afraid she was very clear on her feelings about our powers.
she's my sister.
she's always supported me.
I felt that way about my sister, your mother, before she dropped me in that urn.
my mother put you in there?
why have you never told me this?
you had such beautiful memories.
I didn't want to destroy them.
and I was hoping that Ana would be different.
but she is exactly like your mother.
she will never accept who you are.
I'm so sorry.
I-I felt that you deserved the truth.
are you okay?
I'd actually like to be left alone, if that's okay.
of course.
I'll be near, if you need me.
if you're trying to hide from me, Ms. Swan, you're doing a poor job.
I'm not hiding from you. I'm hiding from everyone else.
Ah.
so Belle tells me.
she was watching Neal all night.
while my family was searching for me, I know.
my magic is hurting people, Gold... people I love.
I need you to help me control it.
what makes you think I'm your best option?
because I...
hurt Henry.
what?
I... he's okay, but it was just luck.
you're probably the only person who's safe around me right now.
I need you to help before I hurt anybody else.
there's only one way to help with this affliction.
well, just fine. Do it.
you haven't heard what I have to say. - I don't care.
my son is in pain because of me. Just fix it.
this...
this is an ancient spell.
it's designed to take away light magic from those who choose to part with it, but the effect would be permanent.
so I'd lose all my magic. I'd be... - Ordinary.
but...
your magic would no longer hurt the ones you love, and you would be able to embrace your son.
do it.
well, unfortunately, savior magic doesn't go quietly.
though the spell won't hurt you, it will destroy almost everything else within a city block.
that would make for quite a macabre sight at grannies, don't you think?
so let's find somewhere else out in the woods.
as you wish.
I think I know...
just the spot.
here...
is an abandoned manor.
right here.
you meet me here at sundown.
and I'll have everything prepared.
Thanks, Gold.
please don't tell anyone I was here.
don't worry about me, dearie.
it'll be our little secret.
I need to see my sister, Ana, immediately.
I thought you'd never find me.
our aunt Ingrid... she locked me in here.
because you tried to attack her.
no, Elsa, you can't believe anything she says.
she lied about her past.
she's lying about me. - Is she?
did you learn what our parents were after and then hide it?
I was waiting for the right moment.
so you lied and kept this magical object, this hat, which could strip me of all my powers.
Yes, but I would never hurt you.
enough!
leave me alone to speak with my sister...
now.
please.
you have to believe me.
of course I believe you.
I'm so sorry about all that, Ana.
wait. This was all a ruse?
it was a ruse!
Ohh.
I needed the guards to think I sided with Ingrid.
I'm so sorry. Don't apologize.
you were fantastic.
I believed every word. I was absolutely crushed.
here. I got this back from the jailer.
thank you.
when they took this, it...
it was like they were taking you.
I'm never going to take this off again.
well, hopefully, you'll never end up in prison again.
Oh, speaking of which,
I'm really worried about Ingrid right now.
she's scary and powerful and smart and scary.
you already said scary.
so I'm really hoping you have a plan.
I have a plan... well, half a plan.
we're going to sneak you out of here and then steal back the urn...
and then trap her inside it.
that sounds like a whole plan.
however, I don't know where she hides the urn, and we live in a very, very large castle.
don't worry about that part.
I grew up running around this castle.
I know every nook and cranny.
how is he?
I gave him enough ice for the week.
it should help with the swelling.
no. How is he?
upset.
I just wanted him to understand
Emma's magic is tied to her emotions, like mine.
the reason she hurt him is because she was trying so hard not to hurt him.
it sounds very convoluted when I try to explain it now.
no, no. Um...
it makes perfect sense.
Where's Henry? Is he okay?
he's fine. He's upstairs. We've been trying to call you all night.
well, I'm sorry if I don't respond to your every summons!
though I did bring that locator potion you wanted.
maybe next time, try leading with, "thank you."
now, may I see my son, please?
you might want to finish buttoning your shirt first.
Oh. Well, I was in a rush to get here.
a locator potion. How does this work, exactly?
we just pour it over anything that belonged to Emma... something...
something like this.
it's her.
Hey, mom. It's me. Did Henry come home?
Oh, yes, yes. No, he's fine.
Emma, I am so sorry about what happened yesterday.
I don't want you to ever think that we are afraid of you.
don't worry. It doesn't matter.
no, of course it matters.
this is all gonna be over soon.
I just needed to tell you that I'm okay.
I-I have a way to fix everything.
Emma, no, wait.
what did she say?
she said she's going to get rid of her magic...
forever.
how is that even possible?
she said it will all be over soon, and she can't wait to be home for a cocoa with cinnamon.
did she say anything about the method?
if it was a spell or... a magic object of some kind?
who cares how she's doing it? That's not what matters here.
no, you're absolutely right.
I wonder if she tried to call me.
bloody hell.
I left my talking phone in the back of your truck.
it's just called a phone.
what an impractical name. I'll be back in two shakes.
Emma, it's Killian.
call me right away, or you may never make it home for cinnamon and cocoa... Ever.
damn it, Swan.
don't tell me you trusted The Crocodile.
it's dusty in here.
I'm surprised it bothers you.
Hey, I may have slept in a barn, but it was a spotless barn.
I've never been in this part of the palace.
what makes you think Ingrid hid the urn here?
mother and father told me not to go in the east wing because it was crumbling and dangerous.
so, of course, I had to.
naturally.
but it didn't seem dangerous to me.
just... forgotten.
mother probably wanted to forget the painful memories of her sister.
you royals sure go to exhaustive lengths to ignore your issues.
you're still here?
you're supposed to be outside keeping watch.
and, remember, if you see Ingrid, use the secret signal.
wait, do we have a secret signal?
uh, I think "run" will work just fine.
what is it, Elsa? Is everything all right?
Yeah, I was just thinking about what it must have been like when mother and Ingrid were younger.
I wonder what happened that made them turn against each other.
knowing Ingrid, I'm not surprised things got ugly.
you don't need to worry.
it's in the past.
and you and I both know that can never happen to us.
now... We need to get searching.
we need to find that urn.
look, he's... he's...
he's frozen.
I guess I forgot to tell you everything that happened since you were away.
Ingrid did this?
to be fair, it's the one good thing she's done since getting out of that urn.
and look, there it is.
it's smaller than I imagined.
it must not have been very comfortable.
well, she's going to have to make do because she's going right back inside it.
did you come here for a reason?
as I recall, I already told you what you need to do to free yourself from your dagger.
I have nothing more to give you...
unless...
you simply like watching me.
I never do anything without a good reason.
and watching your twisted mind at work does not qualify.
twisted?
says the man who betrayed everyone in Storybrooke.
I haven't betrayed a single person.
not yet, anyway.
did you forget that you gave me those?
did you forget what they can do?
I don't forget much, dearie.
but if you plan to put that ribbon on Emma Swan, you're about to be disappointed.
with her powers out of control,
I've now found my own use for her.
you think you can take her away from me now?
what did you do?
look down.
remember the urn your sister placed you in?
it had the power to limit your magic.
Elsa destroyed that urn.
well, funny thing about magic...
it can never be destroyed completely.
it simply lives on in other forms.
magic survives.
I visited the barn where the urn was destroyed, collected its remnants grain by grain...
painstaking process.
and I must say... the effort paid off.
when I escape, there will be a terrible price to pay.
don't worry.
the dust won't last long, just long enough to get what I want.
and, uh, you see,
I don't have to betray everyone in Storybrooke.
just you.
and, I'm afraid...
hands off. That's me lunch and dinner.
sorry, friend, but I need to pick your brain.
and I need you sober as friar Tuck on a Sunday when I do it.
I'm not sure Sunday's ever made any difference for that man.
what's happening?
Regina needs our help.
this book. - Funny.
you were never much the reading sort, Robin.
it's not mine. I stole it.
Ah, well, that sounds more like you.
so, what's so important about a book?
whoever wrote this imbued it with magical powers...
powers that could change Regina's future for the better.
we need to figure out who did this.
information about the writer of a magical book.
I might just have an idea.
excellent.
but I'm gonna need me lunch and dinner back.
see, you ain't been in this town as long as I have.
there wasn't always magic, but when it came, it started at one place... the Clock Tower.
see, for 28 years, them hands didn't move.
time stood still.
then one day, tick-tock, it bloody did.
I'm afraid you've lost me, Will.
I understand the significance of the magical clock, but what's that got to do with this book or its author?
do you know what's under that magical clock tower?
no.
a library.
hmm.
I've always liked that picture.
Emma has your eyes.
she has your smile.
do you remember when you took it? How could I forget?
that was the party we had at granny's after Emma helped us go up against...
pan or Anton the giant?
try Cora. - Oh.
we invited Happy to that?
I guess it's easy to lose track.
she has saved Storybrooke a lot.
Mm-hmm.
I'm worried about her, too, but Emma is tough.
she'll be fine.
what if she's making a mistake?
because of us... shouldn't we be out there trying to convince her not to give up her magic?
well, it's her choice, not ours.
she knows we support her, no matter what, and if losing her magic is what she wants, well... maybe it's not such a bad thing.
but it's part of who she is... a savior.
I mean, she was born this way... a hero.
so isn't embracing that the right thing?
well, if the Snow Queen is doing all this because of Emma's power, maybe...
getting rid of it is the heroic thing.
do you remember the night Emma was born?
before we put her in the wardrobe, you said we had to give her her best chance.
maybe now her best chance is for her to be...
normal.
we can't let anyone see us.
Ingrid could have eyes and ears everywhere.
of course, not literally. That would be gross.
and unhygienic.
though she does have skeletons in her closet.
because we did just find Hans in her closet.
and his body does contain a skeleton.
Aah.
okay, that was a close one. Let's go.
you're not going.
is what Ingrid said true?
that our parents went to Misthaven to find something to take away my magic?
it is.
sorry, Elsa, I should have told you the second I got back home.
I just... I didn't know how.
I don't blame them.
when people look at this painting, they see a king and a queen.
but the only thing I see is mama and papa.
they were only human. They made mistakes.
if they could see you today,
I bet they would never ask you to give up a part of yourself.
but they're not here.
and we'll never know.
what matters is that your powers make you special.
and I wouldn't want you any other way.
I've tried this one before.
probably easier when I'm not drunk and getting punched.
it's a pin tumbler with six pins.
not the easiest.
with a bit of luck and a light touch, the old Will Scarlet...
opening hours till 10: 00.
very generous.
indeed.
I can keep sitting here pretending to read about Wolverine, or you can talk about what happened with Emma.
nothing to talk about.
can I at least look at the wound?
not that I don't trust the ice doctor's diagnosis.
okay, fine.
does that hurt?
a little.
not anymore.
all better.
it must be nice to have magic and be useful.
what's that supposed to mean?
I went out there to help her, but I couldn't do anything because I'm just...
ordinary.
we are each given our own gifts.
you have the heart of the truest believer.
you brought us all together.
never think you're ordinary just because you don't have magic...
or claws or...
ripped purple shorts.
now, don't worry about Emma.
she's a hero, and, as we both know...
heroes always win.
Crocodile?!
where are you?!
Emma. No.
no, no, no.
swan, it's Killian again.
you have to listen to me.
I know that you've been to see Gold.
I saw what you did.
and if he's promised to get rid of your powers, don't listen to him.
he doesn't want to help you.
he wants... he wants to collect your powers in a bloody magic hat.
and when he does, you'll be sucked in, too.
I-I don't know what he's planning, but I know that he's been lying to Belle.
the dagger he gave her is a fake.
I only know all this because...
because I'm afraid I've been lying to you, too.
gold blackmailed me into helping him.
he knew.
he knew I'd do whatever it takes to be with you, and he used it against me.
I just wanted to be a better man for you, Swan.
but I failed.
and now because of it, I might lose you.
I'm sorry.
but I hope you never forgive me because that means that you'll get this in time to save yourself.
goodbye.
he looks peaceful.
though you should probably look into hiring some new guards when this is all over.
smart.
now, are you sure you're gonna be okay down here?
Yes, it's not as bad as it looks, except for the dankness and the darkness and the mice...
who are cute, when they're not scurrying over your toes.
but I have shoes.
I promise, I'll be fine.
and I promise I won't be long.
as soon as I return to the palace,
I'll tell Ingrid you're to be banished and that she's to see to your punishment personally.
then when she comes down here, I'll surprise her with the urn.
not like a party... "surprise!"
something more dour to match the occasion, like, "surprise."
what if something goes wrong?
I should come down here, too, just in case.
no, you need to be as far away as possible.
we don't want you getting trapped in the urn by mistake.
please don't worry.
I promise... everything is going to be fine.
surprise!
how was that?
I'd have done it different.
well, I'm afraid you won't get the chance.
you see, I was hoping that Elsa would believe the lies I told her, but I knew I had to be ready in case she didn't.
it doesn't matter.
you'll never turn us against each other.
"never." That's a strong word.
stay back.
wherever you're headed, turn around and go home.
you are in great danger.
gonna listen to you about danger? Get out of my way.
my sweet girl, I am not the one that you should fear.
Rumplestiltskin is.
whatever he's promised you, it's a lie.
how do you know he promised me anything?
so I was right.
you mustn't trust him, Emma.
he doesn't do anything unless it benefits him.
he doesn't care about you.
he would kill you to get what he desires.
you know what I think?
the fact that you don't want me to go means something.
it means I'm going.
I won't let you.
you're not gonna hurt me. You need me.
don't do this.
what the...?
you're not here.
if I could be, I would.
I'm trying to protect you, and that is the truth.
I don't care what you say. That's the truth.
how's Henry?
reading comic books. Refusing to sleep.
so, I think okay.
or at least his version of a brave face.
thank you, by the way, for earlier.
he has enough problems without bringing my mess of a life into it.
by "mess," do you mean Robin Hood?
did you guys, uh...
Oh, come on, Regina. You don't need to be ashamed.
well, I know I don't have to be, but... I am.
is everything okay?
what are you doing here?
well, shouldn't someone be out looking for Emma?
didn't Mary Margaret tell you? She called.
she figured out a way to get rid of her magic.
get rid of it? And you're okay with that?
we support our daughter.
we're not talking about an old pair of Jimmy Choos here.
tell me you're joking.
it may seem drastic, but it's the only way
Emma can be sure never to hurt anyone again.
this could be the worst idea you've ever had, and you hired the wicked witch as your nanny.
well, we actually think it'll be good for her.
we... she could be normal.
let me ask you something.
do you know what I regret most?
countless innocent lives you destroyed?
that I didn't support Henry when he realized he was special.
you of all people should remember.
cause you started it all when you gave him that storybook.
it opened up a whole world for him.
but I was so scared of losing him...
that I tried convincing him he was crazy...
and that being normal would make things better.
thankfully, he had the good sense not to listen to me.
Regina's right.
David, we've been rationalizing, and you know it.
we cannot let her take away what's special about her.
I know.
well, then let's go get her.
Regina, your locator potion...
it's gone.
Where's Elsa?
I'm sorry.
Elsa won't save you.
you don't know her. You don't know me.
but I do. We're a lot alike.
we had families, but we both grew up in this palace, isolated and alone.
I liked to go to the library and bury myself in a good book.
my favorite was an ancient norse legend... The Trolden Glass.
perhaps you read it.
of course I did. I read everything in there.
tell me what you remember.
giving a book report would be a lot easier if you'd let me go.
the other option is I kill you.
it's about a Norse king who had a beautiful daughter he loved dearly.
go on. - He wanted his daughter to be able to see the beauty he saw in her, so he had a mirror made for her birthday.
but the day before it, she died, so instead of reflecting her beauty, it reflected the ugliness of his pain and sorrow.
very good. What happened then?
it's been awhile, okay? - I don't remember every detail.
well, I do.
he was so devastated, he decided his kingdom should share his pain.
so he spent years harnessing dark magic, used it on the mirror, and cast a spell over his entire kingdom.
it made his subjects see only the worst in the ones they loved.
and they turned on each other, destroying themselves.
what does that story have to do with anything?
you were in my room. I'm sure you saw the mirror.
this is just a small piece of it.
I spent years gazing into that mirror, but all I saw reflected back at me was pain, just like the Nordic king.
you're going to cast that spell.
the spell of shattered sight.
it would take an entire lifetime to cultivate enough power to cast a spell over an entire kingdom.
luckily I only need to cast it over you.
you're sure these are from her bug?
Oh, yeah, she definitely spun out here, and then...
she got out of the car and got back in.
anyone else out here?
no. It's just her footprints. Come on.
these are so fresh, we can carry on on foot.
she can't have gone far.
so, before we were interrupted, you were telling me about Robin Hood.
Oh, there's not much to tell. It's not gonna work out.
it's the story of my life.
whatever's working against my happiness is more powerful than I am.
why does it have to work against you?
look at me and David.
we have faced impossible odds numerous times...
often because of you...
and yet we've always worked out.
you know why? Because we have hope.
you get a quarter from the hope commission every time you say that word.
admit it.
I'm serious.
well, it's easy for you to say... you're a hero.
whenever you need help, it just magically shows up, like Henry's book.
Yeah, I think that when you do good, the universe takes care of you. That's why it showed up.
well, it doesn't really matter why.
your wishes are rewarded. Mine are crushed.
well, I refuse to believe that happiness is impossible for you to achieve.
you've come too far.
and, yes, you may be sleeping with a married man, but guess what... so have I.
well, I've done far worse than that.
which doesn't mean that you can't earn forgiveness, a chance at grace.
I have to believe that.
if you do good hoping to be redeemed, is that... really good?
maybe evil is born...
and that's just who I am.
Regina... you saw me grow up.
you know how selfish and shallow I could be as a child.
you know what I've done since.
you have literally seen my heart.
you know it's not untouched.
you are not all evil, and I'm not all good.
things are not that simple.
well, whoever's guiding all this seems to think it is.
you're the hero, and I'm the villain.
free will be damned.
it's all in the book.
and we both know how it plays out.
mm, maybe, but maybe not.
your stories went poorly because you made bad choices.
but now you're making good ones.
it may not happen as quickly as you want, but...
if you stay the course, your happiness will come.
you honestly believe that?
it doesn't matter what I believe.
what matters is that you do.
she's really something, all right.
if evil queens are your type, which I get.
you're still together, then.
that is not relevant.
Hey, no judgments here, mate.
I was the one who told you to follow your heart.
I just want her to be happy, even if she thinks that's impossib...
wait!
Ah.
Whoa!
1988 Mercedes-Benz 560SL repair manual.
all due respect, I'm beginning to think your magic-library theory might be a tad off.
any book we want is hardly gonna be stacked beside...
the cat in the hat.
why would a cat want a hat?
I've seen stranger.
wait.
this wasn't here before.
what wasn't here?
I'm not sure.
incredible.
what is it?
I need to reach Regina.
hello. Who is this? Regina, it's Robin.
I've just found something that you have to see right now.
right now? I'm... I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle...
go. We've got this.
he found something.
maybe hope worked.
well, if it did, I owe you a quarter.
I'll be right there.
Hello? Gold? You here?
gold, you in there?!
there's no need to shout.
I'm right here.
you'll forgive me if I keep my distance.
it would appear your powers are growing increasingly out of control.
Yeah, it was a rough night.
so, what do I need to do?
I've already cast the spell inside that room.
all you have to do is...
step through the door.
is something wrong?
just...
I ran into the Snow Queen.
did you?
well, sort of.
it was a projection or a hologram, or I don't know what it was.
she said I shouldn't do this, that you were trying to hurt me.
all right, so now we know who doesn't want you to do this... the villain.
sounds like an argument for it, but maybe that's just me.
that's what I said.
but you still have doubts.
do you blame me?
no.
is it safe? Will I be okay?
no magic is without risk, even magic used to take away magic.
look, this is very much your choice.
and, of course, it was also your idea.
but it's gonna stop me from hurting people.
that much I can promise, yes.
what would you do?
I wouldn't go in there for anything.
what? Why?
because, Emma, I'm not like you.
I'm a man who makes wrong decisions, selfish decisions.
but you spent all that time looking for Neal.
you sacrificed yourself to save the town.
you married Belle.
and each time, I meticulously undid all the good.
Neal is still gone, the town is still in danger, and Belle, for better or worse, she knows who I am, and that's the man who always chooses power.
she believes you can change.
and I love her for that.
but I fear she's quite likely wrong.
but you, Emma?
you don't need to change.
because you do the right thing.
always.
thank you.
of course.
we have no choice.
watch your step, Captain.
the terrain's a little rough around here.
get out of my way, Crocodile.
I'll die fighting before I let you use that bloody hat on Emma.
death can wait.
how about before you depart,
I'll treat you to a front-row seat and we can watch her use that hat on herself?
no.
Oh, and, uh... In case you were counting on
Emma getting your message...
don't.
no.
I'm not one for loose ends.
don't worry.
you'll get over her...
just like you got over Milah.
how many centuries did that take?
Oh, it matters not.
this might even add a little fuel to your fire.
don't tell me you haven't missed the taste of vengeance.
she's mother to your grandson, Gold!
don't do this.
I wish I didn't have to.
but I need Miss Swan.
surely you understand that.
Oh, thank goodness you're safe.
at first, I couldn't find Ingrid.
and ever since, I've been worried sick.
I suppose I should be grateful.
did everything go all right?
you seem upset.
what's all this?
Oh, I wanted to surprise you with something special.
it's all chocolate.
I'm afraid the ice cream's long melted now, but I can make you more if you'd like.
that's just like you...
thinking some food and fancy jewelry can make up for everything you did to me.
everything I did to you?
Anna, what are you talking about?
it all came back to me when we were in the east wing of the palace, how you ignored me for all those years, left me to wander this place like a ghost.
is this a joke? Because of my ruse?
because if you're trying to get back at me,
Anna, it isn't funny.
do you want to know the worst part?
you let me believe it was all my fault, that I had done something wrong.
how can you say these things?
we promised we'd never be like this.
what's happened?
I've come to my senses.
Anna, no!
Oh, this isn't you.
it can't be. - I'm afraid it is.
Ingrid, you're not... - In an urn. No.
fortunately, I have a chance to show you that I am the only one who will ever understand you.
Anna never will.
this is because of you.
you used your magic to cast a spell on her.
Yes, but a spell that reveals her true feelings, even if she wasn't able to admit them before...
her deepest, darkest emotions now brought into the light.
you wouldn't even talk to me.
go away, Anna. Go away, Anna.
you were supposed to be my sister!
I am your sister.
Anna, please, put the down the urn.
she won't listen to you, Elsa, just like your mother wouldn't listen to me.
the only way to stop her is accept who you truly are.
use your powers on her.
no. I won't give up on my sister.
do it, Elsa! Freeze her! - No, I won't.
I won't hurt my sister.
do it!
do what you will, but know that no matter what, Anna, I love you.
wait. What?
No!
what did you make me do?
you foolish girl.
this is all your fault!
stay away from her!
Oh. Here comes the noble hero.
I know that look in your eyes... in both of your eyes.
just let her go.
eventually, everyone sees me as a monster.
maybe it's time to embrace that...
and be one.
you will accept who you are one day, too.
and we will find our third sister, no matter how long it takes.
Emma, stop!
Elsa, what the hell are you doing here?
you have to leave now.
I'm sorry. I won't let you do this.
my powers are out of control. There's no other way.
please, go, now. - No.
you didn't give up on me even when you nearly froze to death in that ice cave, so I'm not giving up on you now.
I know how scary it is, hurting someone you love.
I've lived in fear of that my entire life.
but giving up your magic is not the answer.
there is another way.
Yeah, you told me all about how Anna's love saved you, and that's great, but guess what.
my version of that with Henry didn't work.
this is all I have left.
I was wrong.
it wasn't just Anna's love that saved me.
what are you talking about?
when I landed in this strange town,
I was certain that without Anna, I was doomed.
but I got control over my powers again without her.
how?
I didn't really know until today, until the same thing happened to you, and then it finally hit me.
it's not only Anna's love or Henry's that can save us.
they accept us for who we are, and that's important.
but it's not enough. It's on us, too.
you have to love yourself, Emma, the good and the bad.
the only way to ever truly be in control of your powers is to embrace them.
because this...
this is who you are.
what are you doing?
it's time to stop being afraid.
but this could kill you.
I'll take that risk if you will.
no.
well, I'm guessing she didn't go through with it.
so sorry.
Oh, but I do love the look of loss on your face.
I may not have the savior, pirate.
but I assure you, today won't be a complete loss.
I need to fill that hat with power, yes, but that was only part of the equation.
because I need something else, a secret ingredient, one I didn't know about...
until an associate clued me in.
a heart.
well, if you need my help procuring it, know the only help I give you is with your demise.
Oh, you're gonna help me, all right.
Ah.
you see, this spell is gonna finally separate me from the dagger so it no longer holds power over me.
but to cast it...
I need the heart of someone special, someone who knew me before the dagger...
before I was the dark one.
unfortunately, everyone who fits that description is already dead, but one still lives.
no.
No! Yes.
as luck would have it, dearie, you're my oldest friend.
get on with it, then.
just do it.
Oh, no. I promised you we'd have some fun first.
you're gonna do everything I say because you're my puppet now.
you're gonna find another way to fill that hat with the power it needs.
and then? Then I'll kill you.
I see someone's been practicing their rock-troll memory magic.
quite impressive, dearie.
you know, I-I prefer her better this way.
more cooperative. Less mouthy.
Ooh.
but this?
this was much lovelier when it was around her neck.
you know... when she was breathing.
what do you want, Rumplestiltskin?
just an old trinket your frozen niece stole from me... a hat.
I haven't seen it.
Ooh, lying is so un-queenly, Ingrid.
where is she? Give her back...
careful, dearie.
you're not the only one who knows How to hide something of value.
we wouldn't want it lost forever, now would we?
though I'm curious why you took memories from that poor girl.
I mean, you would have thought being trapped inside a bread bin was punishment enough.
she learned more than she was meant to.
I wanted us to have a fresh start.
don't we all, dearie? Don't we all?
you know, uh... I'm gonna make you a deal...
an urn for a hat, as simple as that.
and just to make it easy for you, when you "find" the object of my desire, just say my name three times, and I shall come to you.
see you soon!
swan! Are you all right?
she didn't do it. She didn't take away her magic.
wow, I've never seen people so happy about me not doing something.
we'll find another way to defeat the Snow Queen... together.
Mm.
Mm. Easy, tiger, we've got company.
I didn't know you were such a fan of my magic.
why would you say that, Swan?
I'm a fan of every part of you.
are you all right?
of course, love. Why?
if you look at me any harder, you're gonna drill a hole in my head.
I'm just relieved.
you should go outside.
I have a feeling there are a lot of worried people who will be glad to see you.
I got here as fast as I could.
what's so important you couldn't say over the phone?
I'll show you in a second.
but first, you remember this?
uh, the book you apparently stole from me?
Yes, I remember it quite well.
you knew I was a thief when you met me.
all right, so, tonight, I came here looking, trying to find a clue towards that author...
towards your happy ending.
in the public library?
Robin, my happy ending is not a Stephen King book-on-tape.
hang on. But then the strangest thing happened.
I found something.
is this... Us?
Yes.
inside the pub.
I don't understand. This isn't what happened.
is this from the book?
23...Page 23.
is it missing from the book?
no. No, it's already there, and it's you leaving me.
this goes in the same place.
this is the meeting that we never had.
what does it mean?
it means that your fate could have gone many different ways.
it means you're not doomed to suffer.
there's a bright future for you around every turn, even if you miss one.
well, where did you find it?
is there another book? What shelf?
no, it was in my satchel.
what?
not at first. It wasn't there when I left.
it... appeared.
like magic.
it's a sign.
and you can take it however you want, but to me, it's showing you possibility... hope.
that's not something that would ever happen to a villain, is it?
what is it?
I owe someone a quarter.
Rumplestiltskin.
Rumplestiltskin.
Rumplest... - Stop!
I have traveled far to find you.
why are you conjuring the dark one when you have a deal with the sorcerer?
do you doubt he can find the sister you seek?
no. But I lost the one that I already had.
you told me you were a patient woman.
happy endings can take a long time, but they do happen.
does that mean you found a match?
the sorcerer did locate a third magical sister, yes, and she... will be a perfect match.
what do you mean, "will be"?
therein lies the catch. She is not born yet.
how does the sorcerer know something that hasn't happened yet?
he knows many things.
for example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...to the dark one,
you will never find your happy ending.
but if I give it to you...
I will?
you will find this third sister and be reunited with the one you've just lost.
this door will lead you to a new land...
where your happy ending awaits.
just hand over the box, and I will open it for you.
you said that the sorcerer doesn't make deals...
especially with people like me.
why is he doing this now?
the hat is important to him.
and sometimes, people surprise you.
now take this.
when the time comes...
it will lead you to your third sister.
Hey, yo! Hold up!
Emma! Did you do it?
Oh. - I didn't, thanks to Elsa.
I'm so, so glad. Just... Please don't change.
I don't want to.
we love you, no matter what.
I know.
Hey, kid. How are you?
just glad you're okay.
so, your magic... are you in control of it again?
Absolutely.
cool.
mom, when did you get that?
I don't know.
Emma, what's happening?
it won't come off.
mine won't, either.
Aah. - I feel it, too.
it's like it's funneling all my magic away, like it's...
harnessing it somehow.
any idea what this is?
no.
but I have a pretty good idea where it came from.
you look disappointed.
miss Swan did not behave as I had hoped.
did you have a hand in it?
of course not.
my hands were trapped here the entire time.
although, as you said, the urn dust didn't last long at all.
I'd keep my distance if I were you.
you really don't understand what's happening, do you?
I wasn't the one who saved Emma.
Elsa was.
they really are quite wonderful together... like sisters.
your strange fixation really holds no interest for me.
Oh, but it should.
and it will.
you see, these ribbons were of no use to me until this moment.
they can bond Three magical sisters together, but only if all of us are a perfect match.
and what makes for this perfect match?
when all three have embraced their powers, which we now have, thanks to you.
now I wield the magic of my three sisters.
now my mirror is complete.
and with this power,
I can finally cast a spell over all of Storybrooke.
I could probably even defeat you and decorate this place with your bones.
shall I try?
dearie, I warn you... do not overestimate your power.
and I warn you... don't underestimate it.
once upon a time there was an enchanted forest filled with all the classic characters we know. or think we know one day whey found whemnselves trapped in a place where all their happy endings were stolen. our world.
you're too late.
no. No!
open it.
I'm sorry. She's gone.
at least let me say good-bye.
you.
you found me.
did you ever doubt I would?
truthfully...
the glass coffin gave me pause.
well, you never have to worry. I will always find you.
do you promise?
I do.
and do you, Snow White, promise to take this man to be your husband and love him for all eternity?
I do.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Hey.
sorry I'm late.
it's the queen. Run!
she's not a queen anymore.
she's nothing more than an evil witch.
no, no, no. Don't stoop to her level. There's no need.
you're wasting your time. You've already lost, and I will not let you ruin this wedding.
Oh, I haven't come here to ruin anything.
on the contrary, dear.
I've come to give you a gift.
we want nothing from you.
but you shall have it.
my gift to you...
is this happy, happy day, for tomorrow my real work begins.
you've made your vows.
now I make mine.
soon everything you love, everything all of you love will be taken from you forever, and out of your suffering will rise my victory.
I shall destroy your happiness, if it is the last thing I do.
that a good book?
this? It's more than just a book.
Boston south station.
thank you for riding greyhound.
uh, you take credit cards? - Where to, chief?
you look relieved.
well, it is the Internet.
pictures can be - fake, outdated, stolen from a Victoria's secret catalog.
so... - So... um, tell me something t yourlf, Emma.
Oh, uh, well...
today's my birthday.
and you're spending it with me?
what about your friends? - Kind of a loner.
and... you don't like your family? - No family to like.
Oh, come on. Everyone has a family.
technically, yeah, but not everyone knows who they are.
ready to run yet? - Oh, not a chance.
you, Emma, are, by far, the sexiest friendless orphan that I have ever met.
okay. Your turn.
no, wait. Let me guess.
you are handsome, charming... - Go on.
the kind of guy who--and now stop me if I get this wrong
embezzled from your employer, got arrested, and skipped town before they were able to throw your ass in jail.
what?
and the worst part of all of this is your wife.
your wife loves you so much that she bailed you out, and how do you repay that loyalty? You're on a date.
who are you?
the chick who put up the rest of the money.
you're a bail bondsman.
a bail bondsperson.
Really?
look, you don't have to do this, okay?
I can pay you. I've got money. - No, you don't, and if you did, you should give it to your wife to take care of your family.
what the hell do you know about family, huh?
nothing.
another banner year.
can I help you? - Are you Emma swan?
Yeah. Who are you?
my name's Henry. I'm your son.
whoa. Hey, kid. Kid. Kid!
I don't have a son.
where are your parents?
ten years ago, did you give up a baby for adoption?
that was me.
give me a minute.
Hey, you have any juice?
never mind. Found some.
you know, we should probably get going.
going where?
I want you to come home with me.
okay, kid. I'm calling the cops.
then I'll tell them you kidnapped me.
and they'll believe you, because I'm your birth mother.
Yep.
you're not gonna do that.
try me.
you're pretty good, but here's the thing.
there's not a lot I'm great at in life, but I have one skill.
let's call it a superpower.
I can tell when anyone is lying, and you, kid, are.
wait. Please don't call the cops.
please. Come home with me.
Where's home? - Storybrooke, Maine.
storybrooke? Seriously?
all righty then.
let's get you back to Storybrooke.
what's wrong?
nothing.
you're thinking about what the queen said again, aren't you?
snow, please. I can't keep having this conversation.
you have to let it go. We're about to have a baby.
I haven't had a restful night since our wedding.
that's what she wants, to get in your head, but they're only words. She can't hurt us.
she poisoned an apple because she thought I was prettier than her.
you have no idea of what she's capable.
what can I do to ease your mind?
let me talk... to him.
him?
you don't mean - I do.
no. No, no. It's too dangerous.
he sees the future. - There's a reason he's locked up.
can you promise me that our child will be safe?
can you guarantee it? Because he can.
all right.
for our child.
I'm hungry. Do you want to stop somewhere?
this is not a road trip. We're not stopping for snacks.
why not? - Quit complaining, kid.
remember, I could have put your butt on a bus. I still could.
you know, I have a name. It's Henry.
what's that?
I'm not sure you're ready.
ready for some fairy tales?
they're not fairy tales.
they're true. Every story in this book actually happened.
of course it did.
use your superpower. See if I'm lying.
just because you believe something doesn't make it true.
that's exactly what makes it true.
you should know more than anyone.
why is that? - Because you're in this book.
Oh, kid. You've got problems.
Yep, and you're gonna fix 'em.
when we reach the cell, stay out of the light, and whatever you do, do not let him know your name.
if he knows your name, he will have power over you.
Rumplestiltskin. Rumplestiltskin!
I have a question for you.
no, you don't.
they do Snow White and...
prince Charming.
you insult me.
step into the light and take off those ridiculous robes.
that's much better.
we've come to ask you about the - yes, yes! I know why you're here.
you want to know about the queen's threat.
tell us what you know!
tense, aren't we?
fear not, for I can ease your mind, but it's gonna cost you something in return.
no. This is a waste of time.
what do you want?
the name of your unborn child? - Absolutely not.
deal. What do you know?
the queen has created a powerful curse, and it's coming.
soon you'll all be in a prison, just like me, only worse, for your prison, all of our prisons will be time, for time will stop, and we will be trapped someplace horrible, where everything we hold dear, everything we love will be ripped from us, while we suffer for all eternity, while the queen celebrates, victorious at last!
no more happy endings.
what can we do?
we can't do anything.
who can?
that little thing growing inside your belly.
next time I cut it off.
the infant is our only hope.
get the child to safety.
get the child to safety, and on its... 28th birthday, the child will return.
the child will find you, and the final battle will begin!
I've heard enough. We're leaving.
Hey! You! We made a deal!
I want her name! We had a deal!
I need her name! H-h-her name!
her"? It's a boy.
missy. Missy, you know I'm right.
tell me.
what's her name?
Emma. Her name is Emma.
welcome to storybrooke
okay, kid. How about an address?
44 I'm-Not-Telling-You Street.
look, it's been a long night, and it's almost...
that clock hasn't moved in my whole life.
time's frozen here.
excuse me? - The evil queen did it with her curse.
she sent everyone from the Enchanted Forest here.
hang on. An evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here?
Yeah, and now they're trapped.
frozen in time and stuck in Storybrooke , Maine - that's what you're going with? - It's true.
then why doesn't everybody just leave?
they can't. If they try, bad things happen.
what are you doing here? Is everything all right?
I'm fine, Archie.
who is this?
just someone trying to give him a ride home.
Oh, she's my mom, Archie.
Oh. I see.
do you know where he lives?
uh, yeah, sure. Just, uh, right up on Mifflin street.
the mayor's house is the biggest one on the block.
you're the mayor's kid?
uh, maybe.
Hey, where were you today, Henry?'Cause you missed our session.
Oh, well, I forgot to tell you, I went on a field trip.
what did I tell you about lying?
giving in to one's dark side never accomplishes anything.
okay.
well, I really should be getting him home.
Yeah, sure. Well, listen, um, have a good night, and, uh, you be good, Henry.
so that's your shrink? - I'm not crazy.
didn't say that. Just...
he doesn't seem cursed to me.
maybe he's just trying to help you.
he's the one who needs help, because he doesn't know.
that he's a fairy tale character?
none of them do. They don't remember who they are.
convenient. All right. I'll play.
who's he supposed to be? - Jiminy cricket.
right. The lying thing. I thought your nose grew a little bit.
I'm not Pinocchio.
of course you're not,'cause that would be ridiculous.
I say, we fight!
fighting is a bad idea.
giving in to one's dark side never accomplishes anything.
and how many wars has a clear conscience won?
we need to take the queen out before she can inflict her curse.
can we even trust rumplestiltskin?
I've sent my men into the forest.
the animals are abuzz with the queen's plan.
this is going to happen, unless we do something.
there's no point. The future is written.
no. I refuse to believe that.
good can't just lose. - Maybe it can.
no. No. Not as long as we have each other.
if you believe him about the curse, then you must believe him about our child.
she will be the savior.
what the hell is this?
our only hope of saving that child.
a tree? Our fate rests on a tree?
let's get back to the fighting thing.
the tree is enchanted.
if fashioned into a vessel, it can ward off any curse.
geppetto, can you build such a thing?
me and my boy-- we can do it.
this will work. We all must have faith.
there is, however, a catch.
the enchantment is indeed powerful, but all power has its limits, and this tree can protect only one.
please don't take me back there.
I have to. I'm sure your parents are worried sick about you.
I don't have parents-- just a mom, and she's evil.
evil? That's a bit extreme, isn't it?
she is. She doesn't love me. She only pretends to.
kid. I'm sure that's not true.
Ohh. Are you okay?
where have you been? What happened?
I found my real mom!
y-you're Henry's birth mother?
Hi.
I'll just go and check on the lad, make sure he's all right.
how would you like a glass of the best apple cider you ever tasted?
got anything stronger?
how did he find me? - No idea.
when I adopted him, he was only 3 weeks old.
the records were sealed.
I was told the birth mother didn't want to have any contact.
you were told right.
and the father?
there was one. - Do I need to be worried about him?
Nope. He doesn't even know.
do I need to be worried about you, Ms. swan?
absolutely not.
Madame mayor, you can relax.
other than being a tired little boy, - Henry's fine. - Thank you, sheriff.
I'm sorry he dragged you out of your life.
I really don't know what's gotten into him.
kid's having a rough time. It happens.
you have to understand, ever since I became mayor, balancing things has been tricky.
you have a job, I assume? - I keep busy, yeah.
imagine having another one on top of it.
that's being a single mom, so I push for order.
am I strict?
I suppose, but I do it for his own good.
I want Henry to excel in life.
I don't think that makes me evil, do you?
I'm sure he's just saying that because of the fairy tale thing.
what fairy tale thing?
Oh, you know, his book, how he thinks everyone's a cartoon character from it, like his shrink is jiminy cricket.
I'm sorry. I really have no idea what you're talking about.
you know what? It's none of my business.
he's your kid, and I really should be heading back.
of course.
sneaky bastard.
I don't want to do this.
it has to be you. - I'm not leaving you.
it's the only way.
you'll go in there, and you'll be safe from the curse.
he said it would be on her 28th birthday.
what's 28 years, when you have eternal love?
I got faith.
you will save me, as I did you.
what is it? - The baby.
she's coming.
wake up. Wake up!
look!
the curse! It's here!
what are you looking at, sister?
Hey, Leroy. Manners. We have a guest.
so you are, uh, Henry's mother?
how lovely for him to have you back in his life.
actually I was just dropping him off.
don't blame ya.
they're all brats. Who needs 'em?
well, I'd give anything for one.
my wife and I-- we tried for many years, but, uh... It was not meant to be.
well, cry me a river.
Leroy, I'm going to let you out. You need to behave.
put on a smile, and stay out of trouble.
Seriously?
Regina's drinks--a little stronger than we thought.
I wasn't drunk. There was a wolf standing in the middle of the road.
a wolf. Right.
graham, Henry's run away again. We have to
what is she doing here?
do you know where he is?
lady, I haven't seen him since I dropped him at your house, and I have a pretty good alibi.
Yeah, well, he wasn't in his room this morning.
did you try his friends? - He doesn't really have any.
he's kind of a loner.
every kid has friends. Did you check his computer?
if he's close to someone, he'd be e-mailing them.
and you know this how?
finding people is what I do. Here's an idea.
how about you guys let me out, and I'll help you find him?
smart kid. He cleared his in-box.
I'm smart, too. A little hard disk recovery utility I like to use.
I'm a bit more old-fashioned in my techniques
pounding the pavement, knocking on doors, that sort of thing.
you're on salary. I get paid for delivery.
pounding the pavement is not a luxury that I get.
there's a receipt for a web site--whosyourmomma. Org.
it's expensive. He has a credit card?
he's 10.
well, he used one.
let's pull up a transaction record.
who's Mary Margaret Blanchard?
Henry's teacher.
as we build our birdhouses, remember, what you're making is a home, not a cage.
the bird is free and will do what it will.
this is for them, not us.
they're loyal creatures.
if you love them and they love you, they will always find you.
we'll pick this up after recess. No running.
why, thank you.
ms. mills, what are you doing here?
Where's my son?
Henry? I assumed he was home sick with you.
you think I'd be here if he was?
did you give him your credit card so he can find her?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm his... I'm his...
the woman who gave him up for adoption.
you don't know anything about this, do you?
no, unfortunately not.
clever boy.
I should never have given him that book.
what in the hell is this book I keep hearing about?
just some old stories I gave him.
as you well know, Henry is a special boy
so smart, so creative, and as you might be aware...
lonely.
he needed it. - What he needs is a dose of reality.
this is a waste of time.
have a nice trip back to Boston.
sorry to bother you. - No, it's...
it's okay. I fear this is partially my fault.
how's a book supposed to help?
what do you think stories are for?
these stories...
the classics?
there's a reason we all know them.
they're a way for us to deal with our world, a world that doesn't always make sense.
see, Henry hasn't had the easiest life.
Yeah, she's kind of a hard-ass.
no, it's more than her.
he's like any adopted child.
he wrestles with that most basic question they all inevitably face
why would anyone give me away?
I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean in any way to judge you.
it's okay.
look, I gave the book to him because I wanted Henry to have the most important thing anyone can have...
hope.
believing in even the possibility of a happy ending is a very powerful thing.
you know where he is, don't you?
you might want to check his castle.
no.
no. I can't...
have this baby now.
doc, please help me.
it's gonna be okay.
the wardrobe's almost finished. Just--just hold on.
it's ready.
it's too late. We can't move her.
push.
the wardrobe.
it only takes one.
then our plan has failed.
at least we're together.
no. You have to take her.
take the baby to the wardrobe.
are you out of your mind? - No. It's the only way.
you have to send her. - No. No, no, no, no.
you don't know what you're saying. - No, I do.
we have to believe that she'll come back for us.
we have to give her her best chance.
good-bye, Emma.
find us.
you left this in my car.
still hasn't moved, huh?
I was hoping that when I brought you back, things would change here, that the final battle would begin.
I'm not fighting any battles, kid.
Yes, you are. You're here because it's your destiny.
you're gonna bring back the happy endings.
can you cut it with the book crap?
you don't have to be hostile. I know you like me. I can tell.
you're just pushing me away because I make you feel guilty.
it's okay.
I know why you gave me away.
you wanted to give me my best chance.
how do you know that?
it's the same reason Snow White gave you away
listen to me, kid.
I am not in any book.
I'm a real person. And I'm no savior.
you were right about one thing, though.
I wanted you to have your best chance.
but it's not with me.
come on. Let's go.
please don't take me back there.
just stay with me for one week. That's all I ask.
one week, and you'll see I'm not crazy.
I have to get you back to your mom.
you don't know what it's like with her. My life sucks.
Oh, you want to know what sucking is?
being left abandoned on the side of a freeway.
my parents didn't even bother to drop me off at a hospital.
I ended up in the foster system and I had a family until I was 3, but then they had their own kid, so they sent me back.
look...
your mom is trying her best.
I know it's hard, and I know sometimes you think she doesn't love you, but at least she wants you.
your parents didn't leave you on the side of the freeway.
that's just where you came through.
what? - The wardrobe.
when you went through the wardrobe, you appeared in the street.
your parents were trying to save you from the curse.
sure they were.
come on, Henry.
no. No.
No! No!
please. Please come back to me.
Oh, don't worry, dear.
in a few moments, you won't remember you knew him, let alone loved him.
why did you do this?
because this is my happy ending.
the child? - Gone.
it was in the wardrobe, and then it was gone.
it's nowhere to be found. - Where is she?
she got away.
you're going to lose.
I know that now.
good will always win.
we'll see about that.
where are we going?
somewhere horrible.
absolutely horrible.
a place where the only happy ending will be mine.
thank you.
no problem.
he seemed to have taken quite a shine to you.
you know what's kinda crazy?
yesterday was my birthday, and when I blew out the candle on this cupcake I bought myself,
I actually made a wish that I didn't have to be alone on my birthday.
and then Henry showed up.
I hope there's no misunderstanding here.
I'm sorry?
don't mistake all this as an invitation back into his life.
ms. swan, you made a decision ten years ago.
and in the last decade, while you've been...
well, who knows what you've been doing?
I've changed every diaper, soothed every fever, endured every tantrum.
you may have given birth to him, but he is my son.
I was not - no, you don't get to speak.
you don't get to do anything.
you gave up that right when you tossed him away.
do you know what a closed adoption is?
it's what you asked for.
you have no legal right to Henry, and you're gonna be held to that.
so I suggest you get in your car and you leave this town, because if you don't, i will destroy you if it is the last thing I do.
good-bye, Ms. swan.
do you love him?
excuse me? - Henry.
do you love him?
of course I love him.
you're out all night, and now you're going out again.
I should've moved to Boston!
I'm sorry that my heart attack interfered with your plans to sleep your way down the eastern seaboard.
excuse me?
I'd like a room.
Really?
would you like a forest view or a square view?
normally, there's an upgrade fee for the square, but as rent is due, I'll waive it.
square is fine.
now... what's the name?
what a lovely name.
Thanks.
it's all here.
Yes, yes, of course. Yes, dear, thank you.
you enjoy your stay...
who's that?
Mr. gold. He owns this place.
the inn? - No. The town.
so how long will you be with us?
a week. Just a week.
great.
welcome to Storybrooke.
there is a town in maine...
I'd like a room. - Welcome to Storybrooke.
where every storybook character you've ever known...
is trapped between two worlds...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here.
and now they don't remember who they are.
victims of a powerful curse...
everything you love, everything all of you love, will be taken from you.
only one knows the truth, And only one can break her spell.
it's your destiny. You're gonna bring back the happy endings.
you enjoy your stay.
do not despair, my dear. You will attend that ball.
who are you?
I'm your Fairy Godmother, and I'm here to change your life, Cinderella.
but...
my stepmother told me that I couldn't go. She forbade me to leave.
your stepmother doesn't have this.
this wand has the power to take you to your ball, to your prince, and to...
what?
what did you do?
now, now. I got what I wanted.
there's no need to be frightened.
no need?
you just killed my Fairy Godmother.
she was trying to help me.
was she?
do you know what this is?
pure magic. - Pure evil.
trust me. I've done you a favor.
all magic comes with a price.
go on back to your life and thank your lucky stars You've still got something to go back to.
my life... It's wretched.
then change it.
you can't handle this.
wait. Please wait.
I can handle it. Please.
I will do anything to get out of here. Anything.
anything?
do you know how to use that wand, mister...
Rumpelstiltskin. And, yes, of course I do.
then help me.
well, if I do, and you can indeed shoulder the, uh...consequences, then you'll owe me a favor.
name it. What do you want?
something precious. - But I have nothing.
Oh, but you will.
with this wish will come riches more than you know.
I care nothing for riches. I'll give you anything you want.
just get me out of here.
now we're talking.
well, how does it work? - Fear not.
my needs are small, and all you have to do is sign On the dotted line.
do we have a deal? - Yes.
Yes. Thank you.
glass?
every story needs a memorable detail.
let's see how they fit, shall we?
now have a good time, but be sure to watch the clock.
are you sure we can be out in the open? - Enough sneaking around.
if your mom has a problem With me walking you to a school bus, I am more than happy to have that chat.
you're brave.
you'll need that for operation cobra.
speaking of, do you think we need code names?
isn't "cobra" our code name?
that's the mission. I mean us.
I need something to call you.
well, I don't... You can just call me "Emma" for now.
okay, well, then I'll see you later, Emma.
what's with the siren?
it's so hard to get your attention.
all right, well, you got it. Are you arresting me again?
I'm thanking you... For your help finding that coma patient.
we all owe you a debt of gratitude.
well, what do I get...a commendation? Key to the city?
how about a job?
I could use a deputy. - Thank you, but I have a job.
as a bail bondsperson? There's not much of that going on here.
I don't see a lot of sheriffing going on around here, either.
well, here's your chance to see it up close. There's dental.
why don't you think about it and stay a while?
thank you.
how was your walk with Henry?
that's right. I know everything...
but relax. I don't mind.
you don't? - No, because you no longer worry me, Ms. Swan.
you see, I did a little digging into who you are, and what I found out was quite soothing.
it all comes down to the number seven.
it's the number of addresses you've had in the last decade.
your longest stint anywhere was two years.
really, what did you enjoy so much about Tallahassee?
if you were wondering, I did find a place here in town.
I know, with Ms. Blanchard.
how long is your lease? Oh, wait. You don't have one.
you see my point?
in order for something to grow, Ms. Swan, it needs roots, and you don't have any.
people don't change. They only fool themselves into believing they can.
you don't know me. - No, I think I do.
all I ask is, as you carry on your transient life, you think of Henry and what's best for him, perhaps consider a clean break It's gonna happen anyway.
enjoy your cocoa.
Really?
Eesh.
do you've a laundroom I can use?
Oh, no no, no, no, no, no
you okay?
the sheets... They're, uh... They're pink.
you tried bleach?
last night I felt contractions, and...
the doctor said that the baby can come any day now
So...That's great.
it's just that, um, when the... when the baby comes...
no one thinks that I can do this.
no one thinks I can do anything.
maybe they're right.
screw them.
what? - Screw them.
how old are you? - 19
I was 18.
when you--when you had a kid? - Yeah. I know what it's like.
everyone loves to tell you what you can and can't do, especially with a kid, but ultimately, whatever you're considering doing...
or giving up...
the choice is yours.
it's not exactly what you might think it is. - It never is.
people are gonna tell you who you are your whole life.
you just gotta punch back and say,"no, this is who I am.
you want people to look at you differently? Make them.
you want to change things, you're gonna have To go out there and change them yourself, because there are no fairy godmothers In this world.
what are you doing?
changing my life.
I know you think otherwise, but I don't enjoy these Saturday city council meetings.
sometimes they're just unavoidable.
now... you know the rules?
yes on homework, no on TV, and stay inside.
good boy.
under no circumstance do you leave this house.
you mean don't see my mom.
she's not your mother.
she's just a woman passing through.
now do as I say, or there will be consequences.
I'll be back at 5: 00 sharp.
I'm so glad my stuff is here.
Oh, thanks.
so that's all your stuff?
what do you mean? - Is the rest in storage?
no, this is all of it. I'm...
not sentimental.
well, it must make things easier when you have to move.
ms. Blanchard, is Ms. Swan here?
my name is Mr. Gold.
we met briefly on your arrival. - I remember.
good. I have a proposition for you, Ms.
swan. I, uh, I need your help. I'm looking for someone.
Really?
you know what? I'm gonna go jump I-in the bath.
I have a photo.
her name is, uh, Ashley boyd, and she's taken something Quite valuable of mine.
so why don't you just call the police?
because, uh...
she's a confused young woman.
she's pregnant, alone, and scared.
I don't want to ruin this young girl's life, but I just want my property returned.
and what is it?
well, one of the advantages of you not being the police Is discretion.
let's just say it's a precious object and leave it at that.
when did you see her last? - Last night.
that's--that's how I got this.
it's so unlike her.
she was quite wound up, rambling on and on about changing her life.
I have no idea what got into her.
ms. Swan, please just help me find her.
my only other choice is the police, and I don't think anyone wants to see That baby born in jail, now do they?
no, of course not.
so you'll help me then?
I will help her. - Grand.
Hey, Emma, I was thinking we...
Hey, Henry. How are you?
okay. - Good.
give my regards to your mother, and, um, good luck, Ms. Swan.
do you know who that is? - Yeah, of course I do.
who? 'cause I'm still trying to figure it out.
Oh, I meant in reality.
is that... All you brought?
Henry, what are you doing here?
my mom's gone till 5: 00. I thought we could hang out.
Aw, kid, I wish I could, but there's something I gotta do.
please let me help. - No, no. It could be dangerous.
the pregnant maid is dangerous? - She assaulted Mr. Gold.
cool. - This isn't a game. She's desperate.
how do you know? - Because I know.
well, then let's find her. - Oh, no, no, no. There is no "let's.
you cannot come with me. - Then I'll look for her myself.
then I'll find you, and I'll bring you back. - Then you wouldn't be helping the maid.
I am just trying to be responsible here.
and I'm just trying to spend time with you.
Oh, that is really not fair.
so the maid...what's her story?
what's wrong?
nothing.
every year when I was growing up,
I used to watch these fireworks from afar.
and I knew what they meant.
something special was happening at the palace...
now they're for me, for our wedding.
I'm so happy you could come. - Thank you, father.
my dear Ella, we are thrilled to have you Join our family, and I hope our family will soon be growing.
my darling.
congratulations, Ella. You two are gonna be very happy.
why, thank you, James.
Ella, dear. Sorry.
this is truly a night for celebration.
do you realize what an inspiration you are to everyone?
all I did was get married.
all you did was show that anyone can change her life.
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you, too.
you. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to make sure you were happy With your end of the bargain...
you know, true love, riches, happy endings.
did you get everything you desired?
Yes. Yes, I did. Now what do you want?
what's your price? My jewels? The ring?
no, no, dear. Keep your baubles.
what I want is something you don't yet possess, but something I know is... Coming...
your firstborn.
what are you doing? - I thought you were hunting.
I was, but the weather wasn't agreeing, so we came back early.
are we going somewhere?
you're going somewhere.
something's happened. - What?
I'm pregnant.
Ella, that's wonderful.
why are you upset? This is what we wanted.
there's something else.
when we met that night at the ball...
it wasn't my Fairy Godmother who sent me.
it was Rumpelstiltskin.
I made a deal with him for this life. I was stupid.
I didn't understand the price of magic, so I promised him something.
what did you promise him?
he tricked me. I thought that he'd want our gold or jewels.
what was it?
our baby?
I'm so sorry, and now I'm gonna lose it all...My...
my life and... You.
no.
I don't care what that imp said.
magic may have brought us together, but it didn't create this love.
but I made a deal.
I can't break that. He's too powerful.
then the answer is simple. We make another deal.
so this boyfriend of hers... You don't think he was involved in her disappearance?
uh, that would mean he was involved with her at all, which he isn't.
he left her in the lurch right after they found out they were expecting.
hasn't spoken to her since. Like I said, he's a...
Hey, hey, hey! Billy, be careful.
you almost shattered my wolf thing, billy. It's good luck.
I'm sorry, Ruby, but, look, it's fine.
um, Ruby, what about her family?
she's got a stepmom and two stepsisters That she doesn't talk to.
wait. A stepmom, stepsisters, and she's a maid?
Henry, not now.
look, I don't know what you've heard, but it's wrong.
everyone thinks she's not ready to have this kid, but she's trying...taking night classes, trying to better herself, trying to get her life together.
can you understand that? - I think so.
then maybe you should just stay out of it. She's been through enough already.
I've been through it, too, Ruby, and I can help her.
then try her ex.
where can I find him? - He lives with his dad.
can I help you? - Sean Herman?
Yeah. Who are you? - I'm Emma Swan.
I'm... I'm looking for Ashley Boyd.
she's in trouble. I just thought maybe she came to see you.
my son doesn't have anything to do with that girl anymore, so whatever trouble she's in, I am sorry for, but there's nothing we can do to help you.
you're the reason he broke up with her. - Absolutely.
I'm not gonna let my son Throw away his entire life over a mistake.
so you just told him to leave her?
well, what are they going to do, raise the child In the backseat of a car?
some people only have the backseat of a car.
well, they're to be pitied. I'm not letting that happen to my son.
dad, maybe we should help her look. - It's a waste, Sean.
Sean, if you want to come, come. Stop letting other people make decisions for you.
if Ashley runs away with this baby, she's gonna be in some serious trouble.
she's running away with the baby? - Yes.
Sean, inside. Now.
look, believe me... If I knew where she was, I would tell you.
I went to a lot of trouble to get her that deal.
deal? What are you talking about?
you don't know? Ashley agreed to give up the child, and she's being paid very well to do so.
she sold the baby? - Oh, you make it sound so crass.
I found someone who's going to find that child A good and proper home.
and who are you to judge whether Ashley is capable of providing that?
look at her. She's a teenager, and she's never shown any evidence of being responsible.
how could she possibly know how to be a mother?
maybe she's changing her life. - Everybody says that.
now, look, I found someone who's going to pay Ashley extremely well, someone who's going to see to it that everybody's happy.
Mr. Gold.
well, isn't that why you were hired, to bring him the baby?
you can't make her double-cross gold. No one's ever broken a deal with him.
happy to be the first. If Ashley wants to have this baby, she should have it.
anyone who wants to be a mother should damn well be allowed to be one.
why didn't you tell me she sold the baby? - Because I didn't think it was important.
really, considering that's why she's running away?
look, Ashleya is my friend. I don't like the idea of people judging her.
ruby, where's your car?
you didn't send me to Sean to find her. You sent me there to give her a head start.
look, I'm only trying to help her. - Yeah, so am I.
Ashley's in more trouble than you know, Ruby. Where is she?
don't make her deal with Gold without me.
I can't talk in front of him. He's the mayor's kid.
Hey, I'm on your side.
Henry...I need to find this woman, and in order to do that, I need you to go home, okay?
so please listen to me, seriously.
she's not gonna tell me anything if you're around.
okay. - Thank you.
she left town. Said she was gonna try Boston.
thought she could disappear there.
how long ago did she leave? - About a half an hour.
What'd she tell you?
Henry, what the hell?
I am going to Boston. You can't come with me.
you can't go to Boston. She can't leave.
bad things happen to anyone that does.
I don't have time to argue with you over the curse. I've got to get you home.
we have to stop her before she gets hurt. We're wasting time.
if you drop me off, you'll never catch up to her. - Henry...
then Mr. Gold will call the police, and he'll have her sent to jail.
buckle up.
Ashley, what did you get yourself into?
why are we down here? - We need a place to keep him.
Rumpelstiltskin is the most dangerous man in all the realms.
he needs his own special prison, so we converted the mines to hold him.
but how will we get him here? He's eluded all forever.
his strength is also his weakness--his deals.
he can't resist making them, and we already know who he wants to deal with next
you.
we've sent word with one of Snow's bluebirds.
he's accepted a meeting with you.
you're going to tell him that doc heard something With his stethoscope...two heartbeats.
you're going to tell him it's twins.
and if he wants both, which he will, you propose a new deal.
a quill? I-I don't understand.
the Blue Fairy cast a spell on it.
whoever signs with this will be frozen, their magic made impotent.
all you must do is get him to sign the contract.
Ella, this man is a scourge. You will be doing the entire land a service.
should we even use magic?
isn't that what's causing these problems to begin with? What if this magic also has a price?
then I will pay it.
I will do whatever is needed to save you and our child.
let's go.
I hope you like it.
a lot of dwarf blood went into it.
you sure this will work? - Once he's in there, he'll never get out.
you'll be safe.
we can do this, Ella.
okay.
let's get him.
I told you. It's her car.
my baby. It's coming.
is the baby really coming? - Oh, yeah.
don't worry. The hospital isn't that far.
no. No, no, no. Take me to Boston. I can't go back there.
Oh, no. We don't have four hours. Trust me. I know.
no, I can't go back there. Please. He's gonna take my baby.
I won't let that happen, but do you know what you're asking for?
if you keep this child, are you really ready? - Yeah.
are you sure? Because I wasn't.
you weren't? - Nope.
if you want to give this kid its best chance, it's gonna be with someone who's ready, so know what that means.
your whole life is gonna change, and once you decide That it's yours, this running away can't happen.
you have to grow up, and you can't ever leave. Understand?
Yes. I want my baby.
well, well, well.
you're starting to show.
a little bird told me you wanted to speak. - Yes.
I'd like to alter the bargain.
that's not what I do. - But I think you'll want to.
I'm having twins.
is that so?
let's have a look.
and you would, what, give up both?
why is that? I wonder.
my husband--he's... He's having a hard time.
our kingdom is poor.
we're losing money. Our crops are dying.
we can't support ourselves or our people.
and you would trade your other child for...
comfort?
I can always have more children, but I can't make crops grow where the soil is dead.
in exchange for our other child, you will see to it that our land is once again fertile.
I think it's more than fair. - Yes!
Yes, yes. It is, if what you're saying is true.
it is, and all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line.
what a lovely quill!
wherever did you get it?
it's from our castle.
you know, the only way to stop me is through magic.
I'm not trying to stop you.
of course you're not, because as we all know, all magic comes with a price, and if you were to use it to, say...
imprison me, then your debt to me would only grow, and we wouldn't want that, now would we?
just sign the contract, please.
are you sure you're happy with this new arrangement?
then so it shall be.
no one breaks deals with me, deary.
no one.
no matter where you are, no matter what land You find yourself in...
I assure you, I will have your baby.
you know, Emma, you're different.
what's that?
you're the only one who can do it.
break the curse? Yes, I know. You keep telling me that.
no. Leave.
you're the only one who can leave Storybrooke.
you left and came and found me in Boston.
but I came back. I'm 10.
I had no choice, but if anyone else tried to go, bad things would happen.
anyone except... Me?
you're the savior. You can do whatever you want.
you can go.
ms. Swan, the baby is a healthy 6-pound girl, and the mother is doing fine.
what lovely news.
excellent work, Ms. Swan.
thank you for bringing me my merchandise.
did we really win?
Yes. I told you we would.
I was so afraid. I was so afraid that we'd fail, that...
I'd have to go back to that life, that...
that terrible life. I was...
I was afraid that I would lose you And that nothing would have changed.
as long as I'm alive, you will never go back to that life.
now... How is our little Alexandra?
Alexandra? - Did I not mention that I picked out a name?
a name? That's more like a prison sentence.
well, I like it.
men. You really know nothing of ch...
Ella, what is it? - Oh, it's--it's the baby. Something's wrong.
no, no. It can't be. It's too soon. It must be the stress, the excitement.
Oh, I'm dizzy.
sit. Sit.
I'll go get you water. - Okay.
Thomas, it's okay! It's passed.
what did you do?
Ella, what's wrong? - Your highness, what happened?
what did you do to my Thomas?
I haven't done anything.
in case you haven't noticed, I've been otherwise engaged.
something's happened to him. You know! Tell me!
I have no idea, deary, but I did warn you.
all magic comes at a price.
it looks like someone has just paid.
don't listen to him. We'll find Thomas.
no, you won't. Until that debt is paid, until that baby is mine, you're never gonna see him again, in this world or the next, Cinderella.
no. - I will have that baby!
Dr. Kidd to radiology.
well, well. Must be my lucky day.
care for a cup, Ms. Swan?
a baby? That's your merchandise?
why didn't you tell me?
well, because at the time, you didn't need to know.
Really? Or you thought I wouldn't take the job?
on the contrary,
I thought it would be more effective if you found out yourself.
after seeing Ashleys hard life,
I thought it would make sense...To you.
I mean, if anyone could understand the reasons behind giving up a baby, I assumed it would be you.
you're not getting that kid.
actually, we have an agreement, and my agreements are always honored.
if not, I'm going to have to involve the police, and that baby is going to end up in the system, and that would be a pity.
you didn't enjoy your time in the system, did you, Emma?
that's not gonna happen.
I like your confidence.
charming, but all I have to do is press charges.
she did, after all, break into my shop.
let me guess. To steal a contract.
who knows what she was after?
you know, no jury in the world will put a woman in jail
whose only reason for breaking and entering was to keep her child.
I'm willing to roll the dice that contract doesn't stand up.
are you?
not to mention what might come out about you in the process.
somehow I suspect there is more to you Than a simple pawnbroker.
you really want to start that fight?
I like you, Ms. Swan.
you're not afraid of me, and that's either cocky or presumptuous.
either way, I'd rather have you on my side.
so she can keep the baby? - Not just yet.
there's still the matter of my agreement with Ms. Boyd.
tear it up.
that's not what I do.
you see, contracts, deals...
well, they're the very foundation of all civilized existence, so I put it to you now.
if you want Ashley to have that baby, are you willing to make a deal with me?
what do you want? - Oh, I don't know just yet.
you'll owe me a favor.
deal.
what's her name? - Alexandra.
that's pretty.
thank you for getting me here.
Mr. Gold was outside.
I took care of it. She's yours.
she is?
but what did you do?
made a deal with him.
thank you.
thank you.
kid, it's almost 5: 00. We gotta get you home.
I have to go.
Henry's expecting me home at 5: 00...
but I'll see you again...
at the next council meeting.
Oh, and don't forget, you left your socks under the bed.
Pumpkin." my code name.
I was thinking, in honor of Cinderella--Pumpkin.
you got a better one in mind? - Yep.
I'm not sure you're ready yet.
about what you said at the hospital About me being able to leave...
yeah?
see you tomorrow.
what did I tell you?
do not...
leave your shoes lying around on the stairs.
someone could get hurt.
is that her?
I am so sorry. I never should have left you.
you're back? - Yeah, I'm back.
here. I got her a present.
I don't know if they're gonna fit.
they're perfect.
Hello? - Graham, it's Emma.
I was thinking...
maybe some roots wouldn't be so bad.
that deputy job still open? - Absolutely.
then I'm in.
Regina gonna be okay with this? - I don't care. It's my department.
I'll see you Monday morning.
I'll see ya.
whatcha reading?
the hulk...Vs. Wolverine.
I'm ava. I think I've seen you around school.
you're in ms. Blanchard's class, right?
almost ready, ava?
mm, this is my brother nicholas.
come on. Let's go.
you wanna come hang out? - Sure.
where the hell do you think you're going?
open up your bag. - What?
don't think I didn't see you rob me. Open your bag.
but I didn't take anything.
and a liar, too.
that's why you were talking to me.
so your brother could put that stuff in there.
Henry, I'm shocked. And you two-just who do you think you are?
a fine specimen.
the wood it provides will keep our family's hearth warm this winter.
can't I have an ax?
you did say you wanted me here so I could help.
that I did.
so here's your task-Take the cart.
go fill it with kindling. The drier the better.
okay.
and have your brother accompany you. - Okay. Come on.
wait.
take this.
your compass? - So you don't get lost.
a family always needs to be able to find one another. - Yeah.
okay. Go. Be safe.
it's getting late.
we should go.
give it back. Come on, gretel. Give it back.
no, hansel. We need to get back to father.
fine.
follow me.
this is where we left him.
so why isn't he here?
father? - Father!
father!
father? Father!
get up.
what are you doing in my forest?
I'm sorry, madam mayor, but your son was shoplifting.
were you?
look for yourself.
my son doesn't eat candy, and he knows better than to steal.
it was obviously those two. We're going.
Henry. What happened?
ms. Swan, must I remind you that genetics mean nothing?
you're not his mother, and it's all taken care of.
I'm here because I'm the sheriff.
Oh, that's right. Go on. Do your job.
take care of those miscreants.
did you call their parents?
uh, the number they gave me was... Disconnected.
did you guys give Mr. Clark a fake number?
then why is it disconnected?
cause our parents couldn't pay the bill.
you guys were just trying to help out, huh?
please. Please don't arrest us.
it'll just make things worse for our parents.
please forgive us.
we didn't mean to bother you. We just...
well, we just lost our father.
two helpless children, lost and alone, the family torn asunder.
such a sad and moving story.
guards.
seize them. - Hansel, run!
running from me is foolish.
foolish.
but also brave.
and that bravery... May just have saved you and your family's lives.
you're-you're letting us go?
Oh, I'm doing so much more than that.
I'm going to find your father.
you are?
Why?
because you two are going to do something for me.
and then... You'll take us home?
this it?
please. No.
if our parents see you, they'll be so embarrassed.
did henry tell you about my superpower?
we just met him.
I have the ability to tell when anyone is lying.
so tell me the truth.
money problems aside, is everything okay at home?
Yeah, we're great.
can we go?
all right.
she's gone. We're good.
why'd you guys lie to me?
where are your parents?
we don't have any.
do you know them? Do they go to your school?
I've seen them, but... I had no idea. None of us did.
Ava and nicholas zimmer.
said their mother was a woman named dorrie zimmer.
she died a few years ago.
no one seems to know her or remember her.
and the father?
there isn't one-at least not one that they know.
what does, uh, what does social services say?
you didn't report them.
I report them, I can't help them. They go into the system.
the system that's supposed to help.
Yeah, says the woman who wasn't in it for 16 years.
do you know what happens?
they get thrown into homes where they are a meal ticket.
nothing more.
these families get paid for these kids, and as soon as they're too much work, they get tossed out and it all starts over again.
but they're not all like that. - All the ones I was in.
what, we're just gonna adopt them?
I want to look for their father.
they don't know him.
he may not know they exist.
and you think if he knows he'll want them?
I don't know.
but what I do know is it's hard enough finding foster families to take one kid that isn't let alone two.
it's their best shot or
we're gonna be separated?
no. That's not gonna happen.
please.
please don't let it.
excuse me.
Mr... Kry-zowksi?
it's kryzyszkowski. Everyone calls me "k.
Mr. K.I am sheriff swan.
I'm hoping to look at the birth certificates of nicholas and ava zimmer.
well, just, uh, fill out this form... In triplicate.
okay.
I'm so sorry.
those documents have been recently removed.
by who?
don't worry, ms. Swan. You can relax.
I've contacted social services.
turns out these kids are on their own. They need help.
which is exactly what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to find their father.
well... He doesn't exist.
he has to.
well, of course, biologically, he exists, but there's no record of him, which means we have no choice.
these children need a home so they will be put into the foster system.
Storybrooke has a foster system? - No, but I've contacted the state.
maine's group homes, unfortunately, are filled, but they've put us in touch with two homes in boston
a boys' home and a girls'.
they're separating them?
I don't like it either, but we've got no choice.
you need to have them in boston tonight.
me?
well, you wanted to be sheriff. This is what sheriffs do.
Yes, you're taking them. - No.
I promised them they wouldn't be separated.
well, then perhaps you should stop making promises you can't keep.
these children need a home.
I'm just trying to find the best one.
what is that? - My father's compass.
he gave it to me so I could find him, but now it's broken.
when are you gonna tell us where we're going?
this is close enough. - Close enough to what?
the home of the blind witch.
that doesn't sound good.
she has something of mine, and I need you to get it back.
what is it?
something I need to defeat a very wicked and powerful enemy.
it's kept in a black leather satchel inside her house.
well, why don't you get it yourself? How come you need us?
because the house is protected by magic.
I can't enter.
but luckily, the spell doesn't work on children.
you'll have to wait here until nightfall. And then...
once the witch is asleep...
you can sneak in.
and if we do this, you promise you'll find our father?
Oh, indeed I will.
but there's one more thing
the witch's house is...
unique, and because of this, you have to take special precaution once you're inside.
like what?
no matter what you do, no matter how you're tempted...
don't... Eat... Anything.
any luck? - no.
I know who they are.
a brother and sister, lost, no parents.
hansel and gretel.
anything in there about the dad?
just that he abandoned them.
great. Sounds like a familiar story.
whoever this guy is, he could be in laos by now.
no, he's here.
just how do you know that?
cause no one leaves storybrooke.
no one comes here. No one goes.
it's just the way it is. - I came here.
because you're special.
you're the first stranger here ever.
right. I forgot.
well, if he's around here anywhere, I'm gonna find him.
can you tell me about him?
I don't know anything yet.
not their father. Mine.
I told you about your parents. Now you're even living with your mom.
Mary margaret isn't...She's...
never mind.
please?
I was pretty young.
I'd just gotten out of the foster system, and the only job I could get was at this 24-hour diner just off the interstate.
and, um... Your dad was training to be a fireman.
he always got the worst shifts, so he'd come in and order coffee and pie and sit at the counter and always complained that we didn't sell pumpkin pie, but he always came back the next night anyway.
did you get married? - Oh, no. Nothing like that.
we just-we hung out a few times outside of work.
and... Life happened.
his got better and mine got worse, and...I got in some trouble.
when you went to jail.
Yeah.
and before I went, I...
I found out I was pregnant with you.
and... I tried to contact him.
and I found out...
that he died saving a family from a burning apartment building.
so you think I'm a savior, henry?
he was.
your father was a real hero.
do you have anything of his?
something you can remember him by?
something I could see? - i...
I don't.
Henry... I'm sorry. I gotta go.
I may know how to find this guy.
I want to show you guys something. Here.
what's that? - It's my baby blanket.
it's something I've held on to my whole life.
it's the only thing that I have from... From my parents.
I spent a lot of time with a lot of kids in your situation, and all of them...
all of us... We held on to stuff.
I want to find your father, but I need your help.
is there anything of his you've held on to?
I might have something.
but if I give it to you, you'll make sure we stay together, right?
right.
a compass?
our mom kept it.
she said it was our dad's.
thank you.
did you find them?
who? - Your parents.
not yet.
but I'm gonna find yours.
how can you be sure she's sleeping? - I can't.
and remember what the queen said. Not even a lick.
you're right. Look.
and there's the satchel.
what do you think's inside it? - Does it matter?
all that matters is getting it to the queen so she can find father.
No!
I smell dinner.
Emma. How lovely to see you.
I'm flattered you'd take time out of your busy schedule for me.
what can I do for you, sheriff?
I'm looking for information on this old compass.
any idea where it could've come from?
well, well. Look at the detail.
you know, this is crystal, this jeweled setting?
despite the rather unfortunate shape this it's in, this is actually a very unusual piece.
the person who owned this obviously had great taste.
and where would someone like that buy it?
right here, of course.
you know it? - Indeed.
a piece like this is difficult to forget.
do you happen to remember who bought it?
well, I'm good with names, ms. Swan, but maybe not that good.
however, as luck would have it,
I do keep quite extensive records...
and... yes. Here we are.
what's your price? - Forgiveness.
how about tolerance?
well, that's a start.
the compass was purchased by a Mr. Michael tillman.
anything else?
just a name, but I generally find that's all one needs.
good luck with your investigation.
not possible. - Actually, it is.
I'm sorry. Look, dorrie - She wasn't my, um...
it was just once.
sometimes that's all it takes.
I met her when I was camping... And we, um...
no. It's not possible. I don't have twins.
Yes, you do.
you have twins that have been homeless ever since their mother passed away.
you have twins who have been living in an abandoned house because they don't want to be separated from each other.
and twins who are about to be shipped off to boston unless you step up and take responsibility for them.
look... I can barely manage this garage. I can't manage two kids.
and why are you so sure they're mine?
besides the timing?
have you ever seen this?
I lost this.
let me guess-12 years and 9 months ago?
I know it's a lot. Believe me, I know.
a month ago, a kid showed up on my doorstep I gave up for adoption, asking for help with... Something.
and I ended up moving here, for him.
I heard about that. It's the mayor's son.
but... Staying in town is...
it's a lot different than taking him in.
I don't have my kid because I don't have a choice.
you do.
those kids did not ask to be brought into this world. You brought them into this world.
you and their mother. And they need you.
and if you choose not to take them, you are gonna have to answer for that every day of your life.
and sooner or later, when they find you
because believe me, they will find you...
you're gonna have to answer to them.
I'm really sorry. I am.
I don't know anything about being a dad.
if it's a good home you're looking for, it's not with me.
Hello? - Hey, it's me.
I need you to come outside right away.
is everything okay?
don't say anything in front of the kids, but no, it's not.
he doesn't want the kids.
and you don't want to tell them?
I can't, because all i'll be telling them is that the false hope I gave them is exactly that.
the truth can be painful, emma, but it can also be cathartic.
I agree on the painful part.
well, hey, look, you told henry the truth- That his father's dead- And he's handling it great.
I didn't tell him the truth.
what?
Henry's father was no hero, and trust me, he does not need to know the real story.
maybe we can hide the kids, just until we can find a family for them...Someone to take care of them.
Yes, hiding the 12 year olds is a good plan.
you have a better idea? - Or maybe there isn't an idea.
maybe you just have - Sheriff?
shouldn't you be on the interstate? - What are you doing here?
seeing to it that you do your job.
you know you don't need to check up on me. I know what I have to do.
Really?
because those kids are supposed to be in boston tonight.
where are you?
Yes. Nice and tender.
a succulent roast you'll make.
quick! She's gonna cook me! We gotta do something quick!
stay calm. When she opens the cage to get you, don't try to fight.
then while she's carrying you to the oven, grab the key that's in her pocket and toss it to me through the bars.
she's coming. She's coming. I can't do it. I'm gonna die!
gravy or butter?
what shall it be?
come with me, little boy.
gravy or butter?
gravy... Or butter?!
how shall I baste you?
butter it is.
time to cook.
quick, gretel! Lock her in!
let me out!
let me out! You come back right now! Let me out!
you'll pay for this!
let me out!
I would've gone gravy.
my dear children.
were you successful in your task?
Yes, your majesty. Though we were almost made into dinner.
Oh, how barbaric.
,if I could have my satchel.
I've waited a very long time for this.
let's hope you didn't let me down.
you did it.
Yeah, we did.
you've got a strong heart, girl.
you remind me of myself at your age.
we did all that... For an apple?
Oh, trust me, dear boy, this is not just an apple.
it's a weapon.
a weapon for a very particular and devious enemy, one who's still under the illusion...
that she's safe.
whatever your plan is, we did what you asked.
now you have to keep your promise and find our father.
of course.
to reunite your family, so you can live happily ever after.
you were left alone in the woods.
you deserve better than a father who would abandon you, but he's all we have.
perhaps he doesn't have to be.
what do you mean?
you and your brother have impressed me.
you aren't the first boy or girl that I've sent into that...
sticky, sweet house, but you are the first to emerge.
and as a reward...
I've decided to invite the two of you to live with me, here.
you mean that we get to live in a castle?
Yes.
you would have your own rooms, of course, personal carriages and valets, too.
all of your dreams could come true.
no.
we want our father back.
he would never abandon us.
and even if he did, we would never want to live with someone as terrible as you.
is that so? - Yes.
we're going to find him, with or without your help.
and when we do, we're going to prove you wrong.
we'll see about that.
Gretel, what's happening?
come on.
it's gonna be
here.
I'm sorry, but we gotta go.
let's go, henry.
no. You can't take them.
they can't leave storybrooke, emma. They can't.
something bad will happen.
something bad has already happened.
you've gotta be kidding me. - What happened? What's wrong?
engine stalled.
who are you calling? - Help.
now she's cavorting with dwarves?
when did that happen?
your majesty, the prisoner you requested is here.
bring him in.
I demand to be released.
my children are in that forest that you took me from-alone.
they could be in great danger.
Yes, I know all about your children.
that compass you gave sweet little gretel
well, I'm afraid it didn't help her find you though, now did it?
what have you done with them? You tell me where they are!
gone.
I told them you abandoned them, leaving nothing but a compass to find their way.
but I didn't bring you here to answer your questions.
you're here to answer mine.
I offered your children everything
whatever their hearts desired
and they still chose uncertainty because of their blind faith in you.
tell me why.
why did your children refuse me?
because we're a family.
and family always finds one another.
release him.
you're letting me go?
you can all be together...
as a family...
as soon as you all find one another.
hansel, wake up.
she let us go.
I'm scared. - Don't be.
everything'll be fine.
Nicholas, look.
those are them? - Those are them.
and your car? It's fine?
I just wanted you to see 'em. Just once.
I didn't think I could do it either.
I gave up henry 'cause I wanted to give him his best shot.
when I saw that he didn't have it, I couldn't leave.
I was just as scared, more probably.
but once I saw him, got to know him...
I couldn't go back.
you're taking them? To boston?
I don't have to.
no. You don't.
what happened?
their dad?
he showed up. Changed his mind.
changed his mind?
just like that?
he might have had a little nudge.
they found their father. That's great.
I wonder what that would be like.
maybe you'll find out. You can't give up.
I don't know.
I kinda think giving up might be the best plan.
I think I need to let go.
no, you don't.
really...
if they wanted to know me, they wouldn't make it so hard to look.
maybe.
but maybe there's other reasons. Maybe there is an explanation.
if there is, it's something crazy - Something even crazier than henry's theory.
Yeah, what's henry's theory? - Well...
that my parents put me in a magical wardrobe and sent me to this world to save them.
and who does he think they are? Well...
for one... you.
me? - Well, snow white.
snow white has a kid.
apparently, that book you gave him
not exactly the stories in the most traditional sense.
I have a kid. You'd think I'd remember that.
Yeah, you'd think.
you do kind of have my chin.
I think I need to go get some air.
I'm gonna go think.
if you're gonna be back late, I can wait to eat with you.
no, don't do that.
I'll leave you leftovers.
what a pretty blanket.
Thanks. Good night.
um, what's that? - Just an old file. What's up?
pumpkin pie. I... I thought you'd like some.
it was pumpkin, right? - Right.
Henry... About your father...
yeah?
I'm glad I told you. - Me, too.
gimme that.
what you did with ava and nicholas
you really are changing things.
is this storybrooke?
Yeah.
any place to get a room around here?
uh, you're staying?
that's the plan.
just looking for a bed.
granny's bed and breakfast is just up the road. Another two blocks.
thank you.
I didn't catch your name.
that's 'cause I didn't give it.
I thought you said strangers don't come to storybrooke.
they don't.
once upon a time, an evil queen banished every storybook character you've ever known to our world.
who knows the truth and who can break the spell?
you don't play with the curse.
I don't understand. You're not going to kill me?
run.
you not only lied to her. You lied to me.
what are you saying? - That we shouldn't be together.
it's been 24 hours since Kathryn went missing.
have you found anything?
I need you to come to the sheriff's station with me and tell me everything.
thank you.
I hope Kathryn's somewhere warm, not out in the cold.
I think you need to start worrying about yourself a little bit more here.
your wife is missing. You are in love with another woman.
there's this...Unexplained phone call.
I know. I know. I just...
I can't explain why it says that.
I didn't do anything to my wife.
I'm pretty good at spotting a liar.
and honestly, liars have better material.
now go home.
I can go?
we don't even know if there was a crime yet.
so get some sleep.
thank you.
and, David, maybe...Get a lawyer.
you can't be serious.
a whole year without a roof over your head?
well, you get used to it.
plus I had the motorcycle, so if I didn't like a place after a while...
I've never even been out of storybrooke.
what was your favorite place?
nepal.
best people.
they have these prayer temples carved into mountains that are overrun with lemurs.
what's a lemur? - Ruby!
just give me a sec!
they're little animals.Yeah.
and they have these eyes that reflect light, so at night, it looks like they glow.
stop flirting and get over here!
who's there? - Let me in.
I'm just a poor old widow.Spare me.
let me in or I'll... - yes?
I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow the
you'll huff and puff?
I couldn't think of nothin'.
Oh, so you thought that you'd level the house with the power of your breath?
well, a case could be made.
granny's in the other room.
you know she doesn't like me opening the shutters.
no, she doesn't like me.
that's what I meant.
you gotta get outta here. - I know. Anywhere.
well, a blacksmith's boy can get work all over.
you'd leave everyone you know?
you'd do that for me?
I'd do anything for you.
Peter, watch out. Your air of danger is slipping.
come out, just for a minute.
it's already dark. She'd never let me.
red! Where are you? What are you doing?
let go. - Pay the price. One kiss.
red, get in here!
what's going on?
nothing that concerns you.
just a bunch of fools trying to get themselves killed over a few dead sheep.
wolf took out a dozen last night.
so you called me in here to what, just to keep me in sight?
good evening, red.
we're just forming up a hunting party.
you're hunting the wolf?
can I go with them, please? I'll be safe in a big group.
don't be ludicrous. You are staying inside and you're keeping that hood on.
you know red repels wolves.
they're not wearing red.
they're damn fools, too.
there's only two more nights left in wolfstime. Let it take a few sheep.
now go home.
I hope they kill the wolf.
then we can have lives again.
you just want to roam around the woods with that wastrel Peter.
he's not a wastrel.
he works hard. He has plans.
Oh, I am sure he does.
now come on. You know what to do.
now go to sleep, girl. - Yes, granny.
I hope I don't see that boy mooning around here tomorrow.
and wear the hood!
Yes, granny.
I can't believe you did that. That was humiliating.
I want you to start working Saturday nights.
come on. We have an agreement about Saturday night.
I want to start training you to do the books and the reorders.
business is booming lately, and with more money comes more paperwork.
Yeah. None of that sounds good.
it's gotta be done.
is this a punishment for talking to that guy?
if I wanted to punish you, I'd have better reasons.
for one thing, you were late.
for another thing, Liza, you dress like a drag queen during fleet week.
and you dress like norman bates when he dresses like norman bates' mother.
ruby, you're a grown woman.
you can't keep acting like some kid.
you just want me to act like you until I turn into you.
well, I am not a fossil yet, granny.
I should be out there having adventures with lemurs.
well, as long as you work here, you are gonna listen to me.
I didn't ask to work here. - Well, then what's keeping ya?
nothing. I quit!
did you get any sleep at all last night?
I'll sleep with the trolls in the afterlife.
I'll get the shutters. You go check if that wolf left the chickens alone.
Yes, granny.
wear your hood!
I'm sorry. I can go.
are you stealing our eggs? - no.
not a lot.
it's-it's all right.
thank you.
it was just that, um, um, last night, there was something out there.
there was howling, and...
I heard it, and it was so cold, so
come on.
come with me.
everyone calls me red.
I'm sn... Frosty.
Frosty? Really?
no.
it's just that someone's looking for me, so...
you don't know or trust me yet.
Hey, I-I get it. I just need something to call you.
uh, Margaret. Oh, no. Uh, Mary.
well, then, Mary, come on.
I just gotta bring in some water before we go in. It'll just take a second.
what was all that howling?
it's wolfstime.
killer wolf out there.
as big as a pony but a lot more bloodthirsty.
it's been stalking the area pretty regular. It kills cattle and
hang on. It sticks sometimes. Could you just...
look. Look at that. Mary.
look at the water. Mary. Mary?
is he okay? David?
Oh, yeah. He's a little shaken up, but he's headed home. He's fine.
any word from Kathryn? - Nothing new.
did you check with Boston again?
she's not there, Mary Margaret.
so we have no idea what happened to her?
all we know is that she found out about you two, gave you a well-deserved slap, and then disappeared.
"well-deserved"?
do you really believe that? - No.
I'm just preparing you for what everyone else is gonna think.
you two are gonna look bad until we figure the truth out.
you mean David?
that people are going to think in order to... Be free with me...
some are. And he's not doing himself any favors.
so if there's anything you could think of to pin down his whereabouts that night
he wasn't with me. We really were through.
sorry. No, don't need a ride.
it's awfully cold out here.
I'm fine. Really.
I can carry your bag. Where are you headed?
Dr. Whale?
Mary margaret. Emma. Hello there.
I was just having a talk with Ruby here.
but I should, um - Yeah. Yeah, you should.
Yeah.
was he bothering you?
the day I can't handle a lech is the day I leave town, which this is, I guess.
you're leaving?
I had a fight with granny. Quit my job.
you quit?
where you going?
I don't know.
away.
Yeah, well, buses out of town don't really happen.
and you might want a destination first.
Hey, if you need a place to figure things out, you could always come home with us.
Y-y-yeah. Just for a little while.
come on.
it kills our livestock!
the one thing I know is that last night was the very last massacre.
you know, if I had stayed with that party for another ten minutes, I, too, would be among the dead.
and when I think if I'd only doubled back, maybe I could've caught it in the act.
maybe I would've been able to slay the creature.
you would not.
widow Lucas.
this creature is more powerful than you can imagine.
you wouldn't have a chance.
stay inside. Hide your children. Forget your livestock.
you've said all this before.
but I haven't said how I know.
nearly threescore years ago, I was a child with six old brothers
big as oak trees, all of them veterans of the second ogres-war, and my father - The biggest of them all.
come one wolfstime, he decided to go out and take on the wolf.
a different wolf back then, of course, but just as fearsome.
they went out there to protect me.
I was supposed to be asleep, but I crawled out on the roof to watch and lay down in the thatch.
they had the beast surrounded, the seven of them, with spears all pointed in at it.
and then it started.
it was lunging - Not at the men, at the spears, grabbing with its teeth, breaking the shafts.
they stabbed it with the splintered end, but it didn't matter.
it tore their throats so fast that not a one of them got a chance to scream or pray...
or say good-bye.
when my father died, I tumbled from the roof, and I landed in the blood in front of the wolf.
I felt its breath on my face.
then it clamped its hot jaw on my arm, and I rolled away.
then it looked at me with eyes so black they weren't even there, and it walked away.
you ever see a wild animal just turn its back and walk away like you don't matter?
if this wolf is like that one, there is no defeating it.
it's already won just by existing in our world.
you don't kill it.
you just hide.
so your granny's kind of intense.
Yeah. A bit.
I feel like a rat in a trap.
is this trap keeping you from...
being with someone?
how did you know?
well, I saw some looks exchanged back there, and I hate to break it to you, but it wasn't subtle.
Yes. Peter.
we've been friends forever, but...
now things are... Well, changing.
that must be nice.
do you have someone? - Oh, no.
uh, I'm not sure that's in my future.
you're lucky, red. - I know.
and we're talking about going away together.
but I don't even get any time with him.
granny's too afraid of the wolf to let me out alone.
you saw what the wolf did.
sometimes I wonder if she's right.
Oh, she's right about the wolf, but she's wrong to use it to keep you from love.
you think that's what she's doing?
let's kill the wolf.
hang on. - We'd be heroes.
red, teams of trained hunters have been killed.
but they go at night when it's got the advantage.
if we went now, we could find it slumbering in its den and kill it in its sleep.
come on.
red, I don't know.
I'm going, with or without you.
but you're right.
I can't let her keep me trapped forever.
I. it's you.
you okay?
you looking for Kathryn, too?
I'm looking.
she knows you didn't do anything. Emma, I mean.
she can tell when people are lying, so... She knows.
and I'll stand with you. I'll tell everyone this isn't possible.
she's going to turn up somewhere.
that's why we're out here, right?
I'm looking.
what about that?
that's a dog.
see how small that is?
don't look where the snow's drifted. It covers tracks.
over here.
that is a rabbit.
what we're looking for will be huge.
like a dog print, but big, like, 8 inches across with big, long claws.
like these?
Yes.
and those.
Oh, my gods.
this was one stride?
from here... To there?
come on.
over there, through the brush and off towards the hill.
you're good at this.
when there's something I want, I'm good at tracking it down.
wanna be a bike messenger? - Bike messenger?
that's about taking things to people in a little basket.
no. Yeah, see, I'm not so great at bike riding.
how about taking things on foot, to people, in a little basket?
I'm not so sure that's a real job.
why do the phones keep doing that?
Oh, the non emergency calls go to a machine when emma's busy.
sheriff's station. How can I help you?
thank you, too.
I' sheriff's station. Hey, Miss ginger.
uh, no, that's not a prowler. That's archie's dog pongo.
throw him a vanilla wafer. He'll quiet down.
did you still want to talk to Emma?
great. Glad I could help.
how's it going, you two?
great, except I can't do anything.
I'm sure that's not true.
I just saw you on the phone. That was good.
that? That's nothing.
no. No, it isn't.
I actually have some money in the budget if you wanna help out around here.
Yes! Thank you. Yes.
um, I could answer phones and help out.
um, is there anything else that you need done? Organize files, cleaning up?
please. I wanna be useful.
I'm swamped with the Kathryn Nolan thing.
if you maybe wanna grab us lunch, I would never say no to a grilled cheese.
done.
you want anything?
um, two chocolate chip cookies, an apple pie, and a hot dog.
he ate at school.
lunch, Mary Margaret? I'm getting for everyone.
uh, no. I'm not hungry.
David's in the woods.
there's something wrong with him.
he looked right through me. It's like...
it's like he was a different person.
here's another one.
right. And then here's...
what?
this print - It looks like it's...
Half-wolf and half-boot. See?
wolves don't wear boots. - No, they don't.
then it just continues like it was a man.
like it was a man and a wolf.
red, what kind of monster is this?
so... - Yeah.
wolfstime is once a month, on the full moon.
there's a story I heard once about a creature
Hey.
aren't we awfully close to the cottage?
who's gone to your window, red?
is it peter?
red, Has he been at your window?
last night.
before the killings.
and he never joined the guys to hunt the wolf.
but I'm sure he wouldn't have killed them.
he wouldn't.
but when the wolf takes over
what about tonight's hunting party?
they're gonna kill him.
or he's gonna kill them.
it doesn't have to be that way.
what can we do? - Tell him.
if he doesn't know, tell him. Stop him.
if he'll listen to anyone, if he'll believe anyone, it's you.
you think I can save him? - I think you can save everyone.
it's gonna be dark soon.
granny will be out of her mind with worry if we're not home.
she'll go out there.
Mary, this is so bad.
so do something.
you're right.
I have to.
I need a couple of grilled cheeses.
I'm working over at the sheriff's station now.
sort of like a...
like a deputy, you know?
I guess sometimes your fate finds you.
seems kind a like you're doing the same thing you always done.
plus so much more.
those will be right up.
Yeah.
Tony has to unwrap the cheese slices.
I help solve crimes.
I'm sure you do.
I hope you're finding what you're looking for.
I am.
you think this wolfs-man is me?
red, you know me.
I know it's not you really, but I think it's using your body.
wouldn't I know?
I mean, wouldn't I wake up in the woods? Wouldn't I remember something?
maybe. Maybe it makes you forget.
Oh, my gods.
those men. They died.
if I did that... - Forget the past.
think of the future.
we can go now, Peter, have lives.
all we need to do is tie you up during the wolfstime, and I know where to get rope.
no.
not rope.
chains.
just in case.
just in case you're right.
I'll show you how to rig it up so that I can't get out. And then you need to get away from me.
no.
I'm staying with you.
I'll stay with you all night and for all the nights to come.
you'd do that for me?
I'd do anything for you.
okay, kid.
don't mean to kick you out, but I gotta go see if David's in some kind of trouble out there.
it's okay. I'm supposed to meet my mom.
there. - Nice.
you know, you can let ruby do more.
she's little red riding hood.
with the little basket? Yeah, she seems like a badass.
she is. She just doesn't remember how cool she is or what she's capable of.
but it's true.
Hey, Ruby. - Hey, Henry.
got your grilled cheese.
thank you.
you all right? - I guess.
I mean, this is something I know how to do, so yay.
okay, let's pack these back up, and we can eat it in the car.
I need to do a little wilderness search, and I need your help.
I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna screw it up.
I mean, I'll screw it up with flair, but
no, you won't. Come on.
you can do this.
this place is massive. How are we supposed to find one guy?
we might be able to hear him.
it's massive.
I'm following the path because there are boot prints, so just stay close.
I shouldn't even be here. I'm just gonna screw everything up.
Oh, wait. - Ruby.
I hear him.
Really? - Yeah, really.
I hear him or... Something. I...
I mean, I know where he is. Don't you?
no.
what are you doing? He's over here!
Oh, god. Come on. David, come on.
wake up. David, wake up.
what? Ruby?
do you remember where you are?
no, I...
what the hell?
I was-I was in your office.
did you bring me here?
you don't remember anything since you were in my office?
last night?
no.
I don't.
well, he's bruised, scratched up, a little dehydrated...
What'd you expect.
he's got a cut on his head.
it's superficial.
I can refer him to Dr. Hopper for a mental health eval, but it's my opinion that whatever caused this blackout is the same phenomenon we observed when he came out of his coma
moving around, acting out, not remembering it later.
we will figure it out.
it's so strange. I can't even believe it happened.
how functional could he be during one of these episodes?
I mean, he talked to someone.
well, people in similar states- Even under sleep medication
do all sorts of things - Cooking, talking, driving a car.
you want to know if I could've made that call.
or more.
you... You want to know if I could've... What, kidnapped her?
killed her? - Now take it easy there.
no one's saying you did anything bad, David.
no, but it would explain why it didn't seem like I was lying.
I wouldn't know. - Stop talking, David.
what are you doing here?
why doesn't this man have a lawyer present?
have you even read him his rights?
no, because he's not under arrest. We're just talking.
right. Just talking.
what are you doing here?
mayor Mills is still Mr.Nolan's emergency contact.
you have to be kidding me.
I thought that changed to Kathryn.
well, Kathryn's currently unavailable.
some people haven't found her yet.
stop trying to place blame and just find her.
there's a whole lot of Maine to search, Regina.
well, you covered this room.
I suggest you branch out.
sheriff's station. Thank you for calling. How may I direct your
Hey, stop. It's me.
here's the thing-the last time David went for a dream walk, he went to the toll bridge.
you know the one?
it's a crazy hunch, but I want you to take my bug and go and see if he was there.
no, I could get somebody else to.
ruby, you were great out there. I still don't know how you found him.
you can do this.
I don't know.
it's gonna be dark out soon. David's gonna be let out.
if there is something there, we've gotta get there first.
we don't have time to argue.
can you do this?
I mean, what am I even looking for?
anything out of the ordinary. Something that doesn't belong there.
and... If I find something?
just follow your instincts.
you... Can't give me a clue... What I'm looking for?
anything of Kathryn's.
ruby? What's going on?
did you find something?
Where's Mary?
come on, girl. Wake up. We best bar the door.
if Mary's not back by now, she'll have to take her chances.
she's in no danger.
what have you done? - No, it's okay. It's all right. It's fine.
where is she? - She's
well, she's with Peter, and I know that you don't like him, but that's really beside the point.
you stupid, careless, ridiculous girl.
no, you don't understand.
Peter isn't - This is going to be difficult to accept.
you just have to trust me.
he's the wolf.
you think peter is the wolf? - yes.
this terrible creature is also human.
it's okay, though. He won't hurt her. She's got him tied up.
he's tied up?
Oh, that poor boy.
red, no. Red! It's me.
don't. Don't! Please!
red! No! Red! No!
red! No.
is... Is that what I think it is?
Yeah.
I can't look.
you okay?
I don't know what I am.
it's gonna be all right.
we can figure out what happened now.
ruby, you did good.
this is doing good? - yeah.
it's amazing.
first you found David and now this.
I know you say you don't know what you are, but whatever it is,
I gotta say, I'm impressed.
don't be. I'm... I'm scared out of my mind.
but you did it anyway.
you knew? - Of course I knew.
her mother was one, too, before a hunting party killed her.
I thought maybe red didn't get it, but when she was 13, it started.
I paid a wizard for that cloak.
keeps her from turning, but she doesn't wear it, and she's found some way out of the house.
why didn't you tell her?
I didn't want her to have that burden.
it's a terrible burden.
that story you told... - That was her grandfather.
he marked me that night, then came back, found me, turned me.
turned you. You're...
granny?
how are you tracking her? - By smell.
I still have that, even though the rest of it has faded away.
gods, I was a fool to think I could keep this from her.
I am a fool and I have cost so many lives.
but you didn't mean to. That's the main thing.
is it?
here.
a silver-tipped arrow will drop her.
follow me.
we're approaching from downwind, so we have a chance.
cloak!
it's too late.
he's gone.
who's gone?
get up, girl. Get ready to run.
what's going on?
come on, red. - Don't you hear them?
we have to go. - Go? I don't understand.
no, I'll explain it later. We must hurry.
what? I'm confused. What's happened?
Where's Peter?
he wasn't the wolf.
granny?
I was wrong to keep it from you.
but now you have to go.
red. Go.
me?
Oh, gods, it's-it's me.
red, go.
I don't want to go like this. - You have to.
no. No. No. No. No. No.
it's okay. It's gonna be okay.
Mary, there's no time. - I know. I'll get her out of here.
you look good. - Thanks.
want something for the sheriff? - No.
is your arm okay? - Same as it is every full moon.
what are you doing here, Ruby?
you here to tell me more about your fine new job?
I want to come back.
Why? You were pretty mad.
I wasn't mad.
looked like mad from here.
Yeah. Here's the thing - Um...
you were talking about having me do all this stuff, and I wasn't sure.
I-I said that you wanted me to turn into you, but...
what I meant was... I don't know how to be you.
you're a tough act to follow.
and then you wanted me to take on all this extra responsibility, and I...
guess I just got... Scared.
don't be. You shouldn't be.
well, I am. But it's okay.
I can do it anyway.
I sort of found someone in myself that was more than I expected.
what about adventure? What about lemurs?
Emma was my lemur. Did that.
found out I could do that and also that I don't want to.
I don't want a job where a good day means ruining someone's life.
I wanna do something that makes me happy.
somewhere I love.
look... Just so you know,
I wanted you to do the books and everything so you could take over when I retire, own the whole place.
own it? - Sure.
I mean, who else would I give it to but someone who loves me back?
proud of you.
what was that? - You heard me.
David, it's going to be okay.
Really? How do you know that?
because I honestly can't say anything about my actions anymore.
well, there has to be an explanation.
you're right.
but the problem is, I don't think it's a good one.
what is it? Did you find her?
we found a box.
wait. Wait. What does that mean?
we think it... We think that she...
what?
there was a human heart inside it.
Oh, my god.
no. No.
we're gonna send it out for some tests, but there aren't any other missing people.
maybe you should go.
there's more.
what?
there were fingerprints inside the lid of the box.
I ran them through the records of everyone in town, and there was a match.
arrest me. - No.
David. - Arrest me, Emma. Do it.
David, the fingerprints weren't yours. - What?
they were Mary Margaret's.
no one... Is getting through that.
when are you installing the torture chamber?
you like it? I call it medieval chic.
I don't care what it looks like as long as it keeps regina and her skeleton keys out.
you're pretty handy for a writer. Where'd you learn how to do all this?
wood shop. Eighth grade.
Oh, speaking of school, have to get going.
um, are you sure you're ready to go back?
after a stint behind bars, how tough can a room full of fourth graders be?
besides, aren't you the one we need to be worried about?
me? Why?
well... You did threaten to take henry away from regina.
Oh, that wasn't a threat. I'm hiring Mr. Gold to help build a case against her.
she tried to frame you for murder.
but you do know what happens if you win?
Yeah.
and you're ready?
to be his mom?
Yeah.
code red. Code red.
Hey, henry. What's going on?
meet me at granny's. It's an operation cobra emergency.
I'm on my way.
Emma, wait up.
you heard the kid. Operation cobra calls.
I didn't think you believed any of that.
Oh, I don't, but sometimes it's the only way to get through to henry.
you know, a custody battle against regina isn't going to accomplish anything.
you need to look at the big picture.
that's the only way you're gonna understand what you're up against.
that's the only way you'll know how to beat regina.
okay, new guy, how's that? - take the day off.
come with me, and I'll show you.
and where exactly would we be going on this magical mystery tour?
if I told you, you would never come.
Oh, come on. Take a leap of faith.
you come with me, and I promise you, you'll find exactly what you're looking for.
my kid needs me. I don't have time for faith.
what's the emergency?
this is sensitive.
if it's sensitive, why are we at granny's, out in the open?
I'm hungry.
who else knows that we hide the book at the sheriff's station?
no one. Why?
someone changed it. There's a new story in it.
why would someone add a new story?
to tell something we need to know about the curse.
and what would that be? - I don't know.
the story isn't finished.
why would someone go to so much trouble to add a new story and then not bother finishing it?
that's what's weird.
the story's about pinocchio.
everyone knows how that ends.
well, maybe that's why it was left out.
or maybe there's more to it.
Henry, you are gonna be late for school. Let's go.
hold on, my boy!
I'm trying, father!
faster, father! Faster! He's catching up!
the current... It's too strong!
don't let go!
what is it?
we must abandon ship. Take this.
this is the only one. - No, father.
I'm made of wood. I'll float. We can both survive.
no. We don't risk.
take it! - No, father! You take it!
save yourself!
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio?
you saved me.
where are you? Where are you?
Oh, no.
no.
no. no.
no.
I wish I could've saved you, my boy.
we still can.
please. Save him.
father?
Pinocchio... Look.
I'm... A real boy.
I'm a real boy!
thank you.
I don't know how I can ever repay you. Th...
this is all I-I ever wanted.
you and pinocchio have found each other.
now go. Live your life together as a family.
come, my son.
remember, pinocchio, be brave, truthful, and unselfish.
so long as you do that, you will always remain a real boy.
Mr. Gold? We need to meet.
it's about emma. There's a... Problem.
ms. Blanchard.
I see you're back.
Yes. Isn't it wonderful? Everything worked out.
Henry forgot his lunch. Have you seen him?
he's with his mother.
ms. Blanchard, is there a problem? - Not anymore.
though someone did go to a lot of trouble to make it look like I had done something horrible.
but they failed. - Yes.
Sidney glass, who's safely incarcerated.
if it was sidney.
well, ask your roommate. He confessed. - Of course he did.
are you insinuating something? - Yes, I am.
but I forgive you.
even if you can't admit what you did, I forgive you anyway.
your life must be filled with such incredible loneliness if your only joy comes from destroying everyone else's happiness.
it's so sad, mayor mills, because despite what you think, it won't make you happy.
it's only going to leave a giant hole in your heart.
there's henry now.
what are you doing here?
you forgot your lunchbox.
Thanks.
Henry, it's time for a change.
I think it's time to transfer you to a new class with a new teacher.
why do you want me out of ms. Blanchard's class?
is it because you framed her? - Henry!
do you really think i'm capable of doing something so horrible?
of course. You're the evil queen.
enough. Those fairy tales are not real.
ms. Blanchard should never have given you that book.
she should be grateful I'm not trying to get her fired.
go ahead and try. It won't work.
no matter what you do, snow white will have her happy ending.
she and prince charming will be together.
the curse will end. Good will win.
and I'm not transferring classes.
Ah, Mr. Booth.
I'll be with you in a moment.
on second thought, tell me... As one admirer of antiquities to another...
do you think it's worth my while having this clock repaired?
I'll take your silence as a "yes," then.
you know, i'm very busy right now, and, uh, i'm just a one-man shop.
but, uh, I'll get to the clock as fast as I can.
I wouldn't ask for anything more.
good day. - H-how are you?
first time seeing dear old dad since you arrived at storybrooke?
I'm s-sor...
you know, what surprises me is why a man who claims to be at death's door can't even bring himself to say hello to his father.
what are you afraid of?
that's, uh... That's my business.
fair enough. Let's talk about ours.
you claim to be the only person who can make ms. Swan believe, that you could get her to do exactly what she was brought here to do, and yet, for a man who's running out of time, you don't seem to be in much of a hurry.
it's not me slowing us down. It's her.
all she can think about right now is getting custody of her kid.
sounds like sheriff swan needs a course correction.
she's coming to you for legal advice.
and you want me to steer her toward you.
I can get her there, to believing. Trust me.
I'm sorry. It's just that knowing who you are and your nature, trust is a big ask.
fear not.
a gentle nudge I shall provide.
align the gear on the spindle.
now press the spring.
good work! You fixed it, eh? Bravo!
did you do this, pinocchio?
remember what the blue fairy told you about being a good boy?
Thanks.
Oh, it's okay. He meant no harm.
I'd be laughing, too, if....
I'm sorry. I meant to be good.
I'm not here because of you, pinocchio.
I'm afraid I bring bad news.
wait in your room, my boy. Go on.
H - hang on, pinocchio. I'll come with you.
what is it?
the evil queen... She's threatened the entire kingdom with a curse, a curse that will rip away all that we love.
then we must stop her.
it's too late for that.
so all is lost? - No.
there is hope, if you will help us.
me?
snow white is about to give birth to a child...
a child who will save us all when she reaches her 28th year...
but only if she can be protected from the powerful effects of the dark curse.
but how can I protect this child?
there is an enchanted tree, much like the one you carved pinocchio from.
if fashioned into a vessel, it can protect the child from the queen's magic.
will you do this?
I cannot lose my boy.
I have lost... So much.
I cannot lose him, too.
then build the wardrobe. That's how you will save us all.
I have to save him. I have to get henry away from regina.
I must admit, your intentions are admirable.
however, I won't be taking your case.
what?
you know what regina did. - Yes, but we can't prove it.
and given the mayor's sway in this town, any proceedings against her would be long and drawn out and futile.
the only certainty is henry would suffer. You can't do that to your boy.
so we leave him in the same house with that sociopath?
I'm sorry, sheriff. My mind's made up.
well, then change it.
the only person I've ever seen go head-to-head with regina and win is you.
that's because I know how to pick my battles.
then pick this one.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm just simply not the man to help you beat mayor mills.
no. You're not.
take it easy.
is everything okay? - No.
I am just about out of options.
just about"?
you told me to beat regina, I need to see the big picture.
show it to me.
car trouble?
it won't start.
I've got a car full of groceries, and well, it hasn't exactly been a banner day.
let's see.
your battery's dead. - What?
I don't have any jumper cables, but I can give you a ride home in my truck.
Oh, no, no. Thank you, but I couldn't impose.
I insist, unless you want to have a car full of melted rocky road.
sure.
thank you for being my knight in shining armor.
well, it's more like flannel, but you're welcome.
Hey, why don't you stay for dinner?
I bought more than enough for me and henry, and...
well, I'm making lasagna.
Oh, I-I shouldn't.
it's getting late, and I've gotta get up early tomorrow for work.
of course.
Oh, you can just set the bags over there.
what is it?
Henry.
he's having dinner with archie after his session instead of coming home.
I'm sorry.
lately it seems like he'll do anything to avoid spending time with me.
but I-I shouldn't be burdening you with my problems.
you've already helped me more than enough for one day.
thank you.
you know what?
I do love lasagna.
the evil queen will stop at nothing to destroy prince charming and snow white's happiness.
so we must stop at nothing to undo her curse.
it's beautiful.
this is the last enchanted tree in the entire realm.
it can be done.
I can make a beautiful wardrobe out of this.
the tree contains enough magic to protect two from the queen's curse.
before the curse strikes, before snow gives birth to her child, she and the prince will enter the wardrobe and travel to a distant land, a land without magic, where snow will give birth to her child.
then when she reaches her 28th year, she can begin the battle that will defeat the evil queen.
you see why it is vital that you complete the task at hand?
pinocchio wasn't always a real boy.
he curse strikes, when the things we love are ripped away, he will be turned back into wood again, won't he?
I'm afraid it's impossible to say.
you're frightening the boy. - Oh, no.
I will build your wardrobe, on one condition...
if pinocchio can take the second spot in it.
you can't bargain like this, not when the entire realm is in danger.
if I don't, I will lose my boy, maybe forever.
I - I can't risk that.
snow can raise the child without her husband.
geppetto, think about the example you're setting for pinocchio.
you may be a conscience, but you have not earned the right to tell me what to do.
please. I'm only trying to help.
help? Help, like you "helped" my parents?
your debt to me can never be fulfilled.
but a start would be staying out of this.
understand?
Yes.
good.
here. Here, boy.
pinocchio goes through... Or no one does.
and what will we tell the prince and snow white?
you will tell them that the tree contains enough magic to protect only one.
do we have a deal... Or no?
the tree is enchanted.
if fashioned into a vessel, it can ward off any curse.
geppetto, can you build such a thing?
me and my boy... We can do it.
this will work. We all must have faith.
there is, however, a catch.
the enchantment is indeed powerful, but all power has its limits.
and this tree can protect only one.
a choice must be made.
august, you gonna tell me where we're going and how it's gonna help me beat regina?
we're going on a trip, emma, so I can tell you somebody's story.
whose story? - Mine.
how did you like it?
best lasagna I ever had.
you really know how to work some magic.
here. Let me get the dishes.
Oh, no, david. - No, no, no, no. It's the least I can do.
you saved me from having to call the tow truck today, and now you're doing my dishes.
it doesn't seem right.
please. The last couple of weeks haven't exactly been easy for me, and you've been there the whole time.
well, I can't help it. I feel responsible for you, ever since I... Found you.
you know, after all this time, no one's ever told me the story.
what story?
about how you found me.
that's probably because i'm the only one who knows it.
I was working late.
it... It was a cold night. Must've been 10 below.
and on my drive home, I realized I left my phone at the office.
I remember thinking just to forget about it and I didn't really need it, but...Something inside me told me to turn around and go back.
and that's when you saw me?
you were on the side of the road, unconscious...
so cold you felt like ice.
the doctor said if I found you ten minutes later, it would've been too late.
it's amazing, isn't it?
if I hadn't forgotten my phone,
I wouldn't have been on the road at that time.
Yeah, it's almost...
almost like the universe wanted you to find me.
I- I'm sorry. I- I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.
no, I'm sorry. I just got caught up in the moment.
you don't have to apologize. I just... We...
this is great like it is.
thanks again for dinner.
doc, do something.
it's going to be okay.
the wardrobe's almost finished. Just... Just hold on.
circumstances have changed.
what do you mean,"changed"?
snow white is going to give birth early. The savior will be born at any moment.
pinocchio can't go.
snow white must accompany her daughter or all will be lost.
she must be protected.
this is a land with no magic.
she will need someone to guide her, someone to make her believe in her destiny.
who better than her mother? - But we had a deal.
there is no time to argue. The curse is almost upon us, and I must return to the fairies to make final preparations.
it is vital that you tell snow white what I just told you.
her child is our only hope. She is the only one who can save us.
and my boy... What will happen to him?
all we can do is have faith that one day the savior will restore all that we have lost.
shall we tell snow white?
no.
get in the wardrobe, my boy.
geppetto, you can't. Things have changed.
the savior needs her mother.
no, she needs someone to protect her, to make her believe in her destiny.
my boy... He can do that.
I don't understand, father. She said...
I don't care what she said.
all that matters is you are safe.
but you told me to be honest, father.
you told me not to lie.
sometimes... We have to lie to protect the people we love, eh?
you must look out for the child in this new land.
you must protect her.
I don't want to go. I don't want to leave you.
Pinocchio, you must remember what the blue fairy said.
in 28 years, you must make sure the savior believes.
promise me you'll do that.
that is the only way we'll... We'll see each other again.
I promise.
good. Here.
there will be many temptations in this new world, pinocchio, but as long as you remain brave, truthful, and unselfish, you will not fail.
here. Get in. Get in. Get in.
you'll find me again.
and on that day, I will look at you with pride.
you will be a great man, my son.
what the hell is this?
last I checked, it was a diner.
no more screwing around. I am not a character in one of your books.
what the hell are we doing here?
I think you know.
you've been here before.
this is the diner you were brought to when you were found as a baby.
so you found an article about me. So what?
I thought this trip was supposed to be about you.
it is.
this is my story, and it's your story.
and how is that?
that 7-year-old boy who found you...
that was me.
you must look out for this child in this new land.
promise me you'll do that.
that is the only way we'll... We'll see each other again.
I promise.
why are we in the woods?
all the answers you've been searching for are right where I found you.
see? You're not that 7-year-old boy.
I wasn't found in the woods. I was found on the side of a highway.
why do you think that?
because you read it in the newspaper?
did it ever occur to you that maybe that 7-year-old boy lied about where he found you?
no.
but it occurs to me that you've been lying to me about everything, and I'm done listening.
when I found you, you were wrapped in a blanket, and the name "emma" was embroidered along the bottom of it.
that wasn't in the article, was it?
how would I know that unless I was there?
okay.
let's say you were that kid. Why lie about where you found me?
I lied to protect you. - From what?
that.
a tree?
you've read henry's book, right?
you know about the curse, don't you? Your role in it?
it's true, emma.
we both came into this world...
through this tree.
you're asking me to believe that you are a fairy tale character?
Pinocchio.
right. Of course pinocchio.
explains all the lying.
you're the one who added the story to henry's book.
I needed you to know the truth.
the truth is you are out of your mind, and you're not even a very good liar.
why not write the end of that story?
because this is the ending, and we're writing it right now.
and how does this story end?
with you believing.
not gonna happen.
Emma? Emma, wait.
what... Is wrong... With your leg?
I failed.
what are you talking about?
it doesn't matter. You don't believe.
if you think that by making me feel sorry for you that something's gonna change, you are wrong.
I am not screwing around here.
whatever you believe or don't, this is real, emma. I am sick.
that's an understatement.
you ever been to phuket?
it's beautiful. Amazing island.
full of pleasures. The perfect place to lose oneself.
that's where I was when you decided to stay in storybrooke.
how do you know when I decided to stay in storybrooke?
because at 8: 15 in the morning,
I woke up with a shooting pain in my leg.
that's 8: 15 at night in storybrooke. Sound familiar?
that's when time there started to move forward again.
I was supposed to be there for you, and I wasn't.
because I was halfway around the world,
I got a painful reminder of just how far I'd strayed.
if that tree won't make you believe, maybe this will.
how does that prove anything?
look. - August, I'm looking.
you don't see it, do you? - See what?
your denial is more powerful than I thought.
it's preventing you from seeing the truth.
okay, one of us is losing it here, and it's not me.
you don't want to believe.
after everything you've seen, why can't you just do it?
why is it so important to you that I do?
because i, the town... Everyone needs you.
I don't want them to need me.
well, that's too bad, because we all do.
you're saying that I am responsible for everyone's happiness? That is crap!
I didn't ask for that! I don't want it!
right now. A little while ago, you didn't want henry either, but then he came to you, and now you are fighting like hell for him.
for him!
because that is all I can handle right now.
and I'm not even doing a good job at that!
now you're telling me I have to save everyone?
that is beyond ridiculous. I don't want any of it.
well, that's too bad, emma, because that doesn't change the truth.
you are our only hope.
then you're all screwed.
don't cry, emma. Look at me. Watch this.
there. That's better, right?
do those tools belong to you?
I was just trying to fix the crib.
I didn't want emma to fall out and get hurt.
don't ever touch anything in this house again.
nothing belongs to you.
Yes, Mr. Raskind.
you okay?
uh, can you keep a secret?
Where'd you get that? - I stole it from the sock drawer.
it's enough to buy us all bus tickets out of here.
you're leaving? When? - Right now.
you wanna come?
I told my father i'd take care of emma.
can she come? Please?
we can't take care of a baby.
you want to stay here for the rest of your life? Be my guest.
wait.
I'm sorry, emma.
faster and faster.
come on. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.
you see?
align the gear on the spindle, then press the spring.
who taught you that? - My father.
he taught you well. He must be very proud.
I don't know about that.
I don't think I became the man he wanted me to be.
well, have you tried to make it up to him?
I made him a promise... A long time ago.
by the time I got around to making good on it,
I think it was too late.
but you kept your promise.
you realized your mistake, and you tried to fix it.
that's important.
if I had a son, that would be enough for me.
you look like you might be shorthanded.
I get by.
how would you feel about...
taking on an assistant?
I can't pay you.
that's okay.
I just feel like fixing things.
come in.
code red. Code red. Henry?
Emma, what's wrong?
I need to talk to you.
about operation cobra?
no. About us. Meet me downstairs.
if my mom sees me out here talking to you, she'll get really mad.
Henry, I need to ask you something very important.
do you want to get away from regina?
do you want to come and live with me?
more than anything.
okay. Then buckle up. You ready?
okay. Why? Where we going?
we're leaving storybrooke.
well, my dear Cora, this is where we shall part ways.
thank you for everything.
it's time for me to skin my crocodile.
you might want to rethink this.
we had a deal. Get out of my way.
believe it or not, I'm doing you a favor.
by preventing my vengeance?
ask yourself how I'm doing that.
by using your dark magic.
exactly.
magic is here, and that makes matters a bit more complicated.
if you go off half-cocked after an empowered Rumplestiltskin, do you know what'll happen?
so you do. Good.
you folks need anything?
tackle shop don't open until morning, but if you want to go out and try and snare some of new England's finest pescatarian creatures, I'd be happy to open early for ya.
no, thank you. We're fine.
it's a fine vessel you got there. When'd you get in?
what vessel?
Wh-why-why that one right.
Hey, that's a neat trick.
you some kind of magician back in our land?
what did you do with my ship?
I hid it from prying eyes.
for what we both want to do, we need the element of surprise.
now you ready to listen to me?
go on, your majesty. What now?
let's go have a little look at this storybrooke.
shall we?
what are you thinking?
Oh, that it's good to be back.
yeah?
and what are you really thinking?
28 years is too long to wait between.
Hey. Guess what. Taco shells were on sale.
apparently, tacos not a big item in the enchanted.
what are you guys still doing in bed?
it's the middle of the afternoon.
the trip back was tiring, and I needed to rest.
and I needed to... Help her rest.
Let's-let's go make the tacos.
we have to make a lot because there's gonna be a ton of people at granny's welcome back party tonight.
we thought you were gonna be back later.
Yeah, well, we weren't, so maybe next time you could put a tie on the door or send a text or.
you know what? I-I'm... Gonna go make some tacos.
it's impressive that we can still provide her with a few traumatic childhood memories at this stage of the game.
my queen, we've received word.
snow White and the prince have defeated King George.
his army has fallen. The kingdom is theirs.
and what of George?
his fate is unknown, but without his forces, we are now alone.
we cannot defeat them.
do not tell me what we can or can't do.
where is Snow White now?
alone, on her way back to meet the prince.
excellent.
I don't care how many men you lose.
keep them apart long enough for me to find her.
I will not let them defeat me.
leaving the battle so soon?
the battle's over, Regina.
our army is too great.
you can't win.
well, that all depends on your definition of victory.
I offer you parley to negotiate the terms of your surrender.
my surrender?
fair enough.
my terms are quite simple.
your death.
now!
it was all a trap.
you should've surrendered when I gave you the chance.
we knew you couldn't resist going after Snow.
and now because of your bloodlust, the kingdom is ours.
your reign of evil is over.
I wasn't worried a bit.
I can tell.
Oh, we all missed you.
tacos.
I cannot tell you the relief of cooking something that I didn't have to kill first.
don't I know it. Meat loaf back home? What a bitch.
I just wanted to, thank you all for joining us tonight.
Mary Margaret and I- We have a saying.
that we will always find each other, and while I believe that with all my heart, I'd like you all to raise your glasses and join me when I say, here's to not having to look for a while.
to Mary Margaret and Emma.
cheer.
sorry I'm late.
what is she doing here?
I invited her.
we're celebrating today because of Regina.
she helped us get home.
no matter what she did in the past, we owe her our thanks now.
didn't you think to tell us about it?
I did, but you two were a little busy this afternoon.
Emma, she tried to kill us, yesterday.
no, she didn't. She's trying to change for Henry.
he believes in her, and right now that's enough for me.
I couldn't have changed if I wasn't given a chance, so...
she gets one, too.
I'm glad you came.
me, too.
Oh, I made a lasagna.
what's the secret ingredient? Poison?
red pepper flakes.
gives it some kick.
Archie made a cake.
you don't want to stay for a piece?
I'm fine. Thank you.
okay.
thank you.
you just said that.
F - for inviting me.
Henry wanted it.
I'm glad you guys got to spend some time together.
me, too.
I'd like to see him more.
maybe you'd consider letting him stay over some time.
I - I have his room just...
just waiting for him.
I'm-I'm not sure that's best.
because you know so much about parenting in the five minutes you've been with him.
talk to David.
at least he took care of him while you were away, like I did, during the ten years you were away the first time.
okay.
thanks for coming.
no. Wait. I'm sorry.
I...
Emma, I'm-i'm sorry.
snapping at you - I shouldn't have done that.
will you accept my apology?
okay.
you're right.
Archie said you were trying to change, and, well, you are.
Dr. Hopper said I was trying?
he said you came to see, that you're trying to be a better person.
you understand, I was hesitant to invite you.
I asked him, and he thought it was a good idea.
thank you. It was.
I should be going.
well, is she broken?
not yet.
beautiful day, isn't it, Regina?
why should I answer you, bug?
because I'm making friendly conversation.
that you'll just repeat to anyone with an ear.
you told Ms. Swan about our sessions.
I was simply trying to help you.
by betraying my trust?
I - I mentioned only that you had come to see me as an example of your commitment to change.
I came to you in confidence.
how am I supposed to prove to people I've changed when you're there to chirp in their ears and remind them of my past?
I said nothing specific. I would never betray the doctor-patient confidentiality.
doctor?
doctor. Need I remind you got your PHD from a curse?
is everything okay here?
private conversation. Go take yourself for a walk.
I can be trusted.
I assure you.
you're lucky I've changed.
I fear the queen will never change.
we must dispense justice.
agreed.
what are our options?
how about giving me five minutes alone with her and my axe?
she's still restrained, right?
Yes.
but the magic that we used to capture her will only keep her powerless for a short while.
how about banishing her to another realm?
we can't.
it would be unconscionable to condemn another realm to the suffering that we've endured.
Jiminy's right.
she's our problem, and we have to deal with her.
and only one thing is certain.
as long as the queen lives, the kingdom is in danger.
are you saying...
Yes.
we must kill the queen.
thank you all.
are you sure this is what we must do?
what choice do we have?
as long as she draws breath, she will come after us, after you.
there's always a choice.
you stopped me from killing her once.
took an arrow to save her.
why is this different?
I took that arrow to save your life, not hers.
that was an assassination.
this is an execution.
if we don't stop her now, there's no telling what she'll live to do.
I know it's late, but I was hoping we can talk.
sure. Come on in.
hush, pongo. You know Regina.
I know how hard it is.
real change can often be a struggle.
I couldn't agree more.
Regina, is there something.
so what was it like over there?
well, let's see.
there were ogres, the dead rising, people trying to kill me.
and more ogres.
awesome.
kid, we gotta work on your sense of awesome.
come on. It's time for school.
I'll walk you to the school bus.
it's okay. I can go on my own.
I know that you can. That doesn't mean that you should.
david let me.
well, I'm not David.
you used to let me.
well, I am not me.
I'm walking you, because that's what mothers do, and I'm doing it.
Hey, pongo.
it's okay.
Where's Archie?
Emma, something's wrong.
how do you know?
never mind. The wolf thing.
you know what? 11 is old enough to walk to the bus stop.
I'll pick you up later.
okay.
Oh, hell.
what? What is it?
no. No.
who would do this?
I think I know.
you have a visitor.
daddy.
this is all my fault.
I failed you as a father.
I should have done more to protect you.
can you ever forgive me, child?
there's no need.
how could I blame the one I love most?
the only one to stand by me to the end.
it doesn't have to be the end.
snow and her prince seem rather determined to make it so.
show them regret for what you've done, the pain you've caused.
show them you can change.
they will spare you. Just give them a reason.
I beg of you.
glad to see the sheriff's station's now a family business.
why am I here?
you know why you're here.
because of Archie.
Oh, it's now against the law to get into an argument with someone?
it is if you go to their office later that night and kill 'em.
Archie's dead?
stop it, Regina.
ruby saw you going into his office last night.
then she's lying. I was home all evening.
after everything I've done to change, to win henry back, why would I toss it all away now?
and if I did and I was going to kill Archie, you would never know it.
the fact that he's dead and you "caught" me shows sloppiness.
you've been caught before.
come on, Emma. Who do you think's lying-Ruby or her?
she's incapable of change, no matter how many times we've given her the chance.
why should this time be any different?
Regina, this is your opportunity to meet your end with a clear conscience.
do you have any last words?
Yes. Yes, I do.
I know I'm being judged for my past, a past where I've caused pain, a past where I've inflicted misery, a past where I've...
even brought death.
when I look back at everything I've done,
I want you all to know what I feel, and that is...
regret.
regret that I was not able to cause more pain...
inflict more misery, and bring about more death.
and above all else, with every ounce of my being,
I regret that I was not able to kill...
snow white!
arrows!
take your aim.
fire! - Stop!
snow.
this is not the way.
snow.
take her back to her cell.
so what do we do with her now?
lock her up.
we can't lock her up because she didn't do it.
you really believe her?
I watched her when we told her Archie was dead.
she didn't know.
Emma, I know that you want to believe that Regina can change for Henry, but.
I know what I saw.
look at her in there.- I don't.
the old Regina would've reduced this building to ashes.
that's a woman who wants to change.
she just wants everyone else to see it.
I know that look.
I know her.
I believe her.
with all due respect, you don't know her like we do.
maybe that's the problem.
I know in your kingdom, she was the evil queen, but here, she's Regina.
and I'm still the sheriff, and I say she's innocent until proven guilty.
so...
what do you suggest we do?
let her go.
Emma, she - We let her go, and then we find the truth.
snow, I thought we agreed what had to be done.
instead you show the Queen mercy?
she doesn't deserve it.
you heard her. She's completely unrepentant.
what I heard was a woman who didn't want to appear weak in her final moments.
I've seen her kill. I've seen her terrorize.
every moment I've seen of her has been one of evil.
exactly. That you've seen.
but I knew her before.
I knew her when she was good.
she saved my life when I was a little girl.
that was years ago.
she changed before.
why can't she change back?
you can't be serious.
you want to rehabilitate the Queen?
maybe showing her mercy is the first step.
but if you fail, the entire safety of the kingdom is at stake.
we cannot take that risk.
you're so sure of her black soul?
sure enough to kill?
because there's no going back from killing.
if you think this is the right thing to do, then it's what we shall do.
but know that your path is one that we cannot come back from either.
my, my. Aren't we troubled, dearie?
Rumplestiltskin.
what brings you here?
you have to ask?
I came to witness the queen's execution.
even had my heart set on a wee souvenir.
it's all very disappointing.
I won't apologize for sparing her life.
not when there's a chance she might change.
Regina redeemed.
what a novel thought.
and, how do you plan to accomplish such an impressive feat?
I don't even know if it's possible.
I'm probably just fooling myself.
maybe you need someone to show you that it is possible.
what do you mean?
simple.
I provide you with a test to help determine whether the queen can truly change.
why would I trust you when I know you want the queen dead?
you never make a deal without a price.
maybe I just want her alive.
that I doubt.
question my motives all you like, dearie, but they shall remain mine.
what is yours now is opportunity.
I can help you.
do we have a deal?
Regina's file
it's empty.
she did it.
she killed the kindest soul in this town, a man who only cared about helping.
I promise we'll find whoever really did this.
isn't it time you admit we already have?
Regina had a fight with Archie,
ruby saw her outside last night, and now her file is empty.
that's... That's a lot of evidence.
maybe that's the point. - What do you mean?
well, I don't know how it is in fairy tale land, but in the real world, it's usually hard to find evidence.
but this has been way too easy, unless someone wants us to find evidence.
so you think she was framed? - Well, it wouldn't be the first time that happened in this town.
who would want to frame her?
that's a long list, present company included.
Yeah. But there's only one name on that list that would resort to killing to get what they want.
Oh, well, that looks delicious.
thank you very much, Belle.
nothing warms the heart more than a family reunited.
you have your mother's chin, Ms.Swan.
we know that you killed him.
and your father's tact.
someone's dead?
Dr. Hopper.
why on earth would you think I had anything to do with that?
because all the evidence points to Regina.
and she's not possibly capable of doing something so vile?
it's a frame job. - It wouldn't be the first time you used someone to try to hurt her.
nice to see your memory's still intact, dearie, but this time, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to disappoint you.
it wasn't me.
why should we believe you?
because I can prove it. Ask the witness.
no one was there.
well, that's not strictly true, now is it?
Hey, boy. Good boy.
good boy. Good boy.
I, I didn't know you were such a dog person.
well, a long time ago, in another life,
I got to know a sheepdog or two.
that's fascinating.
but unless you speak dog, how is pongo gonna tell us anything?
through magic, of course.
it won't allow us to communicate, but it will allow us to...
extract his memories.
extract?
you don't have to worry. He won't feel a thing.
why should we trust you?
couldn't you just as easily use magic to fool us?
because I'm not gonna be the one using magic.
you are.
me?
how?
you have it within you.
told me so yourself.
you witnessed it, didn't you?
Emma, you don't have to do this.
if it tells us something about Archie's death, so be it.
do you know what this is?
a dream catcher.
well...
it's capable of catching so much more.
what is that?
memories.
now Ms.Swan
you show us how.
how? It's just a jumble.
will it.
will it, and we shall all see.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
you're doing it.
Regina.
No!
you were right all along.
I'm sorry, Emma.
Emma. Wait. Where are you going?
to get Regina.
well, can we talk about this?
what's there to talk about? She killed Archie.
now she's gotta pay. - Emma, how do you plan on doing that?
she has her powers back here.
Yeah, well, you just saw what happened. So do I.
Yeah. You have something, but you didn't even know what the hell to do with it, and now you're gonna go take on the most powerful woman in town?
excuse me. Weren't you both the ones who've been pushing on the "it's Regina" kick the whole time?
you should be happy you were right.
we may be right, but I also know that going after her without a plan is a mistake.
so what do we do?
even if the dwarfs construct a cell to hold her, we need a way to contain her magic until then.
fairy dust.
Leroy said they were processing a new batch of it.
will that stop her power?
it has before.
the problem is, she'll see us coming.
leave that to me.
trust me, we're locking her up.
your highness.
leave us, please.
but I have direct orders from the prince.
and now you have direct orders from me.
first you stop my execution, and then you defy your husband to see me.
should I be worried there's trouble in paradise?
I'm not here to talk about my fiance.
then why are you here?
I know you weren't always like this, Regina.
the woman who saved my life all those years ago had good in her.
that woman lost much, and now she's gone.
maybe.
but as hard as you've tried to bury her,
I think she's still inside you.
no, she's not.
all you need...
is someone to help you let her out.
what are you doing?
I'm letting the woman who saved my life go.
this is a chance to start fresh, Regina, to leave the evil behind in this cell.
just like that?
just like that.
you make change sound so easy.
did you really think this would protect you?
since I can't use magic,
I can think of no better way than to kill you with the blade you had meant for me.
good-bye, Snow White.
no.
Yes.
no.
that's impossible.
no. That's magic.
and this time, it wasn't thanks to fairies.
Rumplestiltskin.
he took one of your hairs from this and used it to fashion a protection spell.
no.
now there's nothing you can do in this land to hurt Snow or me.
you're powerless against us.
you tricked me.
it wasn't a trick.
it was a test, one that I had truly hoped you'd pass.
we wanted to give you a chance to change, Regina.
Regina, you are banished.
banished to live alone with your misery.
as long as you're alive in this world, you can't hurt us.
you saved my life once, and now I've saved yours.
so we're even.
and if you ever try to hurt anyone in my kingdom again,
I will kill you.
ms. Swan.
I assume you're here to apologize.
I saw you do it.
what?
I saw it.
you choked the life out of Archie.
what are you talking about? How is that even possible?
magic.
you - I saw what happened, and it was you.
he helped you.
you're going to trust him, of all people, when he's probably the one behind this?
we didn't trust him.
that's why Emma used magic instead.
you can use magic.
the savior. Of course.
well, I can only assume he warned you, then.
about what?
that magic always comes with a price.
yeah? Well, that's a price we're both gonna pay.
how's that?
he believed in you.
his heart's gonna break.
that's both our prices.
no.
I will not let you poison Henry against me.
it's an interesting word choice, since you already did.
I want to see him.
he deserves to hear my side of the story! He's my son!
he's not! He's mine!
and after this, you're not getting anywhere near him.
do it!
did you really think that would work again?
you...
you will not keep my son from me.
so much for fairy dust.
maybe some of your newfound magic can save you now.
I don't need it.
I already won.
there is no way Henry will swallow your lies about Archie now.
you can pretend all you want, but we know how you are and who you will always be.
Henry's bus is gonna be here any minute.
you can do this. - Tell my son that someone he loved was killed by someone else he cares about?
I don't know if I can.
Yeah, I don't think I can do any of this.
this is like real parent stuff.
how can I be a parent if I never was one?
I know. I've been asking myself the same question.
Oh, no.
you guys don't have to- I- it's different.
no, it isn't. And yes, we have to.
we can figure it out. So can you.
you don't know me.
you don't know what I was before storybrooke.
and trust me, I was not parent material.
Yeah, but we know who you are since you've been here.
what if I revert? Regina did.
you're not going to.
and the Emma I know was great with Henry.
I was his parent for five minutes.
and I was yours for five minutes, too, but things are different now, for all of us.
we don't have to go through any of it alone.
we're family.
I told you I could walk myself.
I know.
something happened, and...
I want you to hear it from me first.
what is it?
come here.
you have a visitor.
who?
you need to ask?
what other friends do you have, dearie?
you're no friend.
have you come to relish my suffering?
I thought you'd want someone to help raise your spirits.
especially on a day like today.
what's so special about today?
snow White and Prince Charming's wedding, of course.
didn't you get an invitation?
me neither.
still,
nice to be able to see them declare their two love in front of their entire kingdom.
a happy ending after all.
and because of you, there's nothing I can do to stop it.
no way to harm them in this land ever again.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose that's true...
in this land.
what?
the deal I made was explicit.
you can never harm them in this land.
now were you to bring them to another land...
told you I was your friend.
father?
bring my carriage.
I have a wedding to get to.
you're back.
so did you get what you wanted?
Yes.
my daughter's lost everything now.
well, aren't you mom of the year?
I did what was needed.
what about what I need?
you promised you'd help me get my revenge on Rumplestiltskin.
and I've already started.
or didn't you notice the little gift I left you in the hold of your ship?
a gift?
what is it?
not what.
who.
who's that?
someone privy to storybrooke's deepest secrets, including Rumplestiltskin's, someone who can help us determine his weaknesses here.
can't you, Dr. Hopper?
if that's him, then who did you kill?
how do I know? It's my first day in town.
you disguised the body to look like him.
if death wasn't punishment enough...
marvelous work.
thank you.
now you'll have all the knowledge you'll need.
it may take some work...
but this cricket will chirp.
Aye.
that he will.
if you want Ashley to have that baby, you'll owe me a favor.
deal.
there's a whole world full of people hat don't know who or what we are.
what if they see the girl turning into a wolf, for example?
when I pour this potion onto the object I hold most dear, that object becomes a talisman.
it allows me to cross the town line and still remember who I am.
now you can find your son.
belle! - Who's Belle?
who are you? What's going on?
let me...Let me. Let me. There. All better.
good. - How did you do that?
it's nothing to be afraid of. - Get away.
belle, please. - What are you?!
are you okay?
I'm at the town line. Two people down, maybe three.
there's a car, pretty banged up with Pennsylvania plates.
what's going on? - She crossed over the line. She doesn't remember.
Hey, beautiful.
here, I didn't think you'd notice.
I think your ribs are broken.
Oh, that must be why it hurts when I laugh.
did you see his face?
his one true love, gone in an instant!
just like Milah, Crocodile...
when you took her from me.
but you took her first.
gold, are you insane?! - Yes, I am!
you can't do that! - I can if you let me go.
you don't want her to see that. - I'm a stranger to her.
murder is a bad first impression.
what would Belle want you to do?
over here!
No! Him! Take care of him. He can wait.
what? - There's someone in there.
stay. I'll be right back.
do you know this guy? - I've never seen him before.
that's because he drove into town.
from the outside?
looks like the world just came to Storybrooke.
ambulance incoming. E. T.A...one minute.
ambulance incoming. E. T.A...one minute.
Dr. Whale, please report to the E. R.
Dr. Whale, please report to the E. R.
O. R. staff stand by. O. R. staff stand by.
I need to find Dr. Whale!
anybody seen the doctor?
Dr. Whale, we need you in the E. R!
to the Frankensteins.
to a fine new year, papa. - Thank you, Gerhardt.
and let's have a better look at that medal.
my son.
the Silver Cross.
it's embarrassing to have everyone make such a fuss.
well, that's your cross to bear, I suppose.
to the holiday.
something for both of my sons.
too small to be a pony.
your mother gave me that when we were married.
it was her father's.
she wanted to keep it in the family.
I remember.
open yours, Victor.
a commission.
father, surely you're joking.
my work is far too important to leave now.
I purchased you a commission.
you will join the Mobile 34th as their camp physician.
it's an honor.
well, yes, of course, but I'm not sure you realize the important scientific work he's doing.
certainly, but how will he do his work without my financial support?
Papa, I rely on that money.
I've already allowed you the use of our summer home for your foolish purposes.
isn't that enough? - I have made great progress!
the name Frankenstein is going to stand for life!
life everlasting here on earth.
Dr. Whale, please report to the E. R.
I don't know what's going on.
car versus pedestrian. Chest trauma from the wheel. Pedestrian's got contusions, broken ribs.
go to X-ray. Pedestrian first.
hide him. - What?
find a room and hide him.
belle, what's going on? - Get him out of here!
no, what's happening? Belle!
I'd like to know that myself.
belle! Belle! - Everybody, calm down.
Mr. Gold. Everything will be fine.
she's in good hands here.
I promise.
Victor, wait.
he'll cool off.
here. Take this.
you're the eldest. She wanted it for you.
no.
keep it. Don't worry about me.
I'll find another way.
no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you okay?
I'm sorry.
Where's Cora? - What?
again? You're really into this, aren't you?
damn, that hurts.
told you. You cracked a few ribs.
Where's Cora?
you look good, I must say, all "where's Cora? " in a commanding voice. Chills.
you have all sorts of sore places. I can make you hurt.
I have no idea where Cora is. She has her own agenda.
let's talk about something I am interested in... my hook.
may I have it back?
or is there another attachment you'd prefer?
you're awfully chipper for a guy who just failed to kill his enemy, then got hit by a car.
well, my ribs may be broken, but...
everything else is still intact, which is more than can be said for other bad days I've had.
plus I did some quality damage to my foe.
you hurt Belle. - I hurt his heart.
belle's just where he keeps it.
he killed my love.
I know the feeling.
keep smilin', buddy. You're chained down.
he's on his feet, immortal, has magic, and you hurt his girl.
if I were to pick dead guy of the year?
I'd pick you.
we've gotta get into his phone. Let me guess another pass code.
you can't guess. There are a million possible combinations.
10000 - 10000
Leroy, can you get it open or something? Hack it?
well, you do understand that computer hacking and pickax hacking are different.
here, let me try. I have a thing.
and we do know something. There was stuff in his car... rental agreement, maps, receipts.
his name is Greg Mendell.
now let's see...
pictures of him alone at a bunch of Eastern seaboard tourist locations...
a LinkedIn account...
and he tweets pictures of his food.
I'll keep looking, but I think what we have here is a well-documented real-life ordinary Joe.
or Greg.
so whatever's kept random people from stumbling into Storybrooke for the last 28 years...
it's gone.
anyone could drive in.
why are my instincts telling me that's a bad thing?
cause you've seen "E. T." or "Splash" or any other movie where they find something magical and study it to death.
think what'd they do to a werewolf.
Oh, and his friends and family? They're going to come looking for him soon.
let's try not to overreact.
Leroy's right. We don't need outsiders here.
hook says he doesn't know where Cora is, and God knows what she's gonna do.
with other people coming here, that's not gonna be good for anyone.
we need to find Regina, tell her we know she was framed.
I've been tracking her. No luck. She's gone underground.
but what if Cora finds her first? I don't want to think about the damage those two would do together.
this could not have come at a worse time.
it's okay. The guy's being patched up right now. He'll probably be on his way home by morning.
not quite.
he's bleeding into his chest cavity.
it's not a full flood, you know, but pretty soon he'll be drowning in his own blood.
so make it stop. Aren't you a doctor?
you fixed me. Now fix him.
it will take you seconds and cost you nothing.
no. - No?
just... No?
I owe you nothing, Whale.
I owe none of you anything, and some of you owe me.
so, yeah, just... No.
Oh, and point of interest... the driver?
he saw me throwing some magic.
so instead of trying to get him out of here, you better be hoping he dies, because if he doesn't, he's gonna be driving tour buses up and down main street.
so glad I don't give a damn.
look... Letting him die is easy.
I can do that, if that's what you decide.
let's take this somewhere private.
it's not really murder if we let him succumb to his injuries.
I'm pretty sure it is.
of course we save him. - Obviously.
well... - Leroy!
we gotta think it through.
if we save him and kill the whole town, is that really better?
so we have to choose between our lives and his.
we can worry about the town later.
which doesn't mean we should abandon him.
I know, but let's worry about Storybrooke after we save a life.
Dr. Whale, prep for surgery.
anyone else notice he's drunk off his ass?
someone's looking for Greg.
how long before they come here?
good evening, doctor.
how did you get in here?
who are you?
Stiltskin. Rumple Von Stiltskin.
a foreigner.
what tipped you off? My rosy complexion?
Yes, I've seen nothing of your drab little land yet, but I am interested in your work.
well, you're a little late. I've been shut down.
and I can't bring back dead loved ones, anyway, if that's what you're after.
I think my deceased are best kept where they are, dearie, thank you very much.
no, no, no.
my interest is in how you do whatcha do.
you see, where I come from, we do things... differently.
your land has witchcraft, but it's feeble, neglected stuff.
where I live, it's strong and hearty.
but... it cannot restore life.
if you can do this, well...
I'll want to know more, and I'm willing to pay.
how did you do that?
you're missing the point.
money. Yours.
are you a philanthropist? - Well, I've been called worse.
there is a cost to you... knowledge.
you teach me to wield... whatever it is you wield.
that is the deal. - Then it's a deal.
I thought you were bringing... - Igor, tremendous news! This is Rump...
master...
what's happened?
bring back the equipment.
we're staying, and we're going to need a body.
Hello, Rumple.
well, I expected this was just a matter of time.
had hoped you were dead, but hey...
Disappointment's just part of life. I'm sure we can agree on that.
Aw, the crocodile snaps at the little bird.
and after I brought you a gift.
Yeah, did you bring the antidote, too?
Oh, Rumple. It's a peace offering.
and what do you want for this, uh... this "peace offering"?
my daughter.
you were so clever to get her to lay the curse so you could come here.
you don't need her anymore.
let me try to get her back and let us live.
and what do I get for my troubles?
your son.
you know what that is, of course.
it'll find him...
if this one truly is it.
Oh, darling, I have no reason to cheat you.
anymore.
I want you...
to find the one person in this universe who might still love you.
after all, I'm doing the same thing.
do you have any spells to return memories?
I only know what you taught me...
master.
so will you accept my offer of a truce?
truce.
let's seal it like we used to.
what's that?
it's just the guy's personal effects.
I get the best watches this way.
joking. As far as you know.
it's too bad it's cracked.
I thought you'd be scrubbing in by now.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna do that.
arm okay?
I'm not drunk. - Okay, just...
let's save this guy, all right?
I don't care what he saw. We don't let go of people.
right.
of course not.
igor told me that I'd find you here.
I can't believe... I thought you worked with cells in Petri dishes.
my work has progressed. And I thought you supported me.
not like this.
Halt!
don't shoot! We have orders!
he's in uniform.
go! Go!
you shouldn't have come looking for me.
and I thought you supported me.
same person again.
her. Cute.
probably a girlfriend.
we could answer it, just let her know he's okay.
the police could trace it here instantly.
she can activate the "find your phone thing" without us picking it up at all.
that settles that.
Ohh, my nerves can't take this. Is the surgery almost over?
I... I think it takes...
W... w... whoa. Wait. Wait. Any news?
no. I was just looking for the doctor.
he's not in the O. R?
he never came in. - Then page him.
he was not looking so good earlier.
he's here.
no, but his pager is.
he's gone.
got the scent? - Boozy.
maybe Doc can do it.
surgery?
no.
maybe he didn't even run. Maybe Cora grabbed him for some reason.
I don't think so.
he's been in a rough place since he brought Regina's fiance back to life.
Daniel? - Back to life?!
and had his arm ripped off and put back on. - Cool.
wait. Daniel came back?
like some kind of Frankenstein?
that's Whale. The doctor. And Daniel was his...
what went on here while we were gone?
ruby, get going. Bring back... Dr. Frankenstein.
we're gonna send this guy back home with bolts in his neck.
she'll find him.
Yeah, but what kind of state is he gonna be in?
I will bring you back, my brother, I promise.
it's burned... like coal.
cover him.
the sheet will serve as his shroud.
of course, doctor.
Victor? - Father.
you were seen carrying a body into this house.
explain yourself.
my boy. My dear son.
what did you do?!
it was an accident. I was working.
you caused this! The things you do...
you cut into your brother! - No, no, it wasn't like that!
you put your foul magician's work into your brother! - It can work!
I did this for you, too, father.
I wanted you to have two sons again.
and now I have none.
mom?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
mom?
you in there?
can I come in?
mom?
mom? Mom?
Henry, I'm so glad you're here.
I missed you so much when...
I have to let you know I had nothing to do with Archie.
I know. I always knew.
I was framed. I don't know how.
I... It just seems like everything... You knew?
how did you know?
simple.
because I did it.
mother.
did it work?
no?
there was a little problem with what the heart could withstand.
problems of the heart. Isn't that always the way?
could you get out of my light, please?
you know, where I come from, there are hearts that can withstand anything because of magic.
you have hearts?
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna bring you a friend, a master of the hat.
he shall take you to a young woman who has exactly what you need.
you put on a little show for her, and then you walk away with all your prayers answered.
a heart for your brother.
and who is this woman?
her name... is Regina.
you...
I thought we stopped you. How did you get through?
determination. I had to see you.
I needed to tell you that I know why you sent me through the looking glass.
and I know why you tried to have me killed.
and it's... it's all right.
I think it's not all right.
I love you.
I just... I've always shown it in all the wrong ways.
and I never should have made you marry the king.
I'm so sorry.
when you cried over my coffin, it...
it all changed.
you framed me for the cricket.
temporarily, so you could see what these people really think of you.
you made an airtight case. Anyone would believe it.
I didn't want you to reject me. Not again.
you wanted me broken. - Receptive.
you are the most manipulative...
no. I won't even argue.
come with me. We're going to town.
it's the middle of the night. - I don't care.
we'll wake them up...Emma and Henry and the two idiots, and you can tell them how you lied.
you owe me that.
and then you'll let us start over?
I don't see that happening, mother.
but I am... I was trying so hard to be worthy of Henry.
and I deserve the same thing from you.
you're right.
for you, sweetheart.
anything.
Dr. Whale?!
don't come near me!
Rumplestiltskin was right.
the new heart worked.
welcome back, brother.
it's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
no. Not magic.
science.
I'm telling you, it's true. I brought him back.
if you have really given me this...
we've kept him waiting long enough.
he's still recovering.
it's a slow process, so don't expect him to...
you did it.
I did it.
it's really you.
let me see you, my son.
what? What is it? Is he all right?
why doesn't he speak?
I told you, father, it's an adjustment.
I believed you.
the terrible thing is, for a moment, I believed you did it.
he's a monster!
what a fool I was!
that's not my son! You are not my son.
you're a ghoul and a grave robber.
a fool and a witch doctor.
you're a disgrace to this family.
enough.
Gerhardt. Enough.
you have killed our father.
I wanted my name to stand for life.
but everybody just thinks it's the name of a monster.
I guess they're right about that.
Rumplestiltskin says that magic has a price, but from where I'm sitting, seems that science does, too.
every time I try to save a life, someone else dies.
Yeah. Look, you're Frankenstein, and I'm the werewolf.
I ate my boyfriend.
Regina thought she was punishing us by erasing who we were.
but I think she underestimated how much crap we wanted to forget.
Yeah.
but... we can't let it stop us.
she gave us a chance to start over, and I wanna take it.
I think you should, too.
I wasn't such a bad guy, you know.
I wanted to bring life back.
but he never got over our mother.
if I could've just brought her back...
that guy in the hospital... Someone keeps calling for him.
maybe a wife, a mother.
maybe there's still some stuff you can fix.
nervous?
not about owning up to what I've done.
it's just... these carriages are strange.
and something's... irritating me.
for mommy. Oh, that used to be you.
when were you in my house?
I haven't had the pleasure.
that was in my house.
think I don't know where that was? It's one of my most treasured possessions.
well, let's be honest.
taking me to be pilloried by the town might gain you some points, but as long as Emma and her parents are here, he's not really yours.
not like he was when he made things for his one and only mommy.
you've been too bad for too long, and now they see you as a... a snake.
you don't want their love at all.
what do you want?
my son back.
and I want my daughter back.
I meant everything I said earlier.
I am so sorry.
I can do better.
I won't push you away again.
let me into your heart.
together, we can get him back again.
how?
Oh, I have a few thoughts.
you're back. - Finally.
I don't know why everyone's so worried.
I was just stretching my legs.
now I'm gonna go do this thing.
Gerhardt? My brother?
I was trying to bring you back.
are you here?
vic... tor? - Yes. Yes, it's me.
no. I won't do it.
I will still save you.
father is wrong.
I will find a way.
where are they?
getting coffee from the machine. What's the verdict?
he'll live. - You did it?
thank you.
monster to monster.
you did it!
he's gonna make it?
he's got some recuperating ahead of him... a few weeks maybe, but yes.
he's going to live.
thank goodness. - Or me.
telling you right now, this will come to no good.
quiet, Leroy.
I wanna talk to him. - He's waking up now.
already?
I waited a couple of hours to tell you in case he, you know, keeled over, but so far, so good.
all right, then. - Well, let's talk to him.
we're not talking to him as a group. We're not a group-sheriff.
but we've been doing this together.
we're trying to convince this guy this place is normal.
in a normal town, the sheriff goes in and asks a few questions.
she doesn't bring her parents in with her.
that's probably true.
we'll be right here, then.
I know you don't remember, but just...indulge me.
please.
be careful with it.
it's a... it's a cup. - Yeah.
it's... it's damaged.
just... look at it. Focus.
it's your talisman.
it's a cup.
you dropped it... in my castle.
you were afraid that you had angered me.
here. You... you need to go and take your cup, okay?
no, no, no, no. I... I charmed it.
if you focus, it will work.
it's magic.
okay, just go away.
s... stop talking about magic and take your cup.
just look at it.
just go... just go away.
I'm sorry.
nurse?
sheriff Swann, actually.
I'm thirsty.
here.
I have your personal effects. I'm just gonna put them here, okay?
so, Mr. Mendell, I wanted to talk to you about the accident.
did I hit somebody?
Oh, my God. I hit someone. Is he okay?
don't worry about him.
I mean, the... the damage was pretty minor.
Oh, thank God.
but I do need you to state what happened in your own words...
what you did, what you saw.
well, I... I didn't see anything. I...
well, you were driving.
Yeah, but...
I saw the road, of course...
I just think I might be able to put your mind at ease.
there might be... an explanation if you saw...
I was texting.
I looked down, just for a second.
and when I looked back up, he was... he was right there.
and he was too close to avoid, but I...
I know that it's not legal in Maine.
it's okay.
I'm just glad that you...
were honest with me.
so no charges?
no. No charges.
I will let you go with a warning this time.
thank you.
so when... when can I head home?
as soon as the doctor clears you. We don't wanna keep you.
he didn't see nothin'?
free and clear. - Oh, good.
now maybe things can calm down for ten minutes and we can catch our breath.
you were out all night.
where were you? Granny wouldn't tell me anything.
did I miss it all?
cereal okay? - Yeah.
Rumplestiltskin and Captain Hook had a fight, and someone got hurt.
we weren't sure if Dr. Frankenstein could fix him, but he did.
doctor?
that's who Whale is.
Yeah, but without the neck bolts.
the monster had the bolts, not the doctor.
right, but either way, some of us having known him... it's weird.
it's not weird. We're past it. We were cursed.
what are you talking about? - Nothing.
wait.
really, it's nothing.
Frankenstein isn't in here.
it's not even a fairy tale.
that means it comes from another land with different stories.
eat. I really wanna go to bed.
if the curse went to places with other stories, then who knows who else is in this town?
gold. We've all had a long night.
you remember that favor you owe me, Miss Swan? - Yeah.
I'm cashing it in.
it's not... a good... - You do honor your agreements, don't you?
I need to find someone, so we're leaving today.
pack your bag. - Leaving?
well, where?
wait. Find someone? Who?
my son.
it has to be today because every minute I'm here, is a minute closer to me killing Hook.
so it's really best for all concerned if I leave, and you're gonna come with me.
Oh, and, um, we have a long history, so know this and know it to be true.
if any harm comes to Belle while I'm gone,
I'm killing all of you.
I'll see you at noon.
honey?
I... I... I know. Just wait. Wait. Just listen. Just listen. Okay?
Yes, I'm okay. I... I was in an accident.
and, honey...
you're not gonna believe what I saw.
this will only take a moment.
don't push me over.
if I cross the line, I'll lose my memory.
it's a cruel fate.
a fate you were more than willing to bestow upon Belle.
you've had this rag since the day we met.
why is it so important to you?
my grandmother made it for me when I was a boy.
it's always brought me good fortune. What difference does it make?
all the difference in the world.
it's your only chance.
what do you mean, my only...
what's your name?
and who am I?
Rumplestiltskin.
the Dark One.
I remember everything!
how can this be?
well, it seems our little experiment was a success.
now go.
I have a trip to plan.
some of us knew him as Archie.
others as Jiminy.
but we all knew him as a true friend.
and though he may not be gone, he will always live on inside of us, reminding us to be our best selves...
to do the right thing, to always fight for what we believe in.
so we shouldn't think of today as good-bye, just as a way of saying...
Archie, we'll be listening.
I miss you so much, my friend.
you are at least... You are in a better place.
wait! No, please, don't! Wait! Please! Please!
as your patient, The Dark One must've told you all manner of secrets.
where is his dagger?
I don't know anything about a dagger.
no, you don't. Do you?
it's his weakness.
now tell me, does he have any others?
very well.
I've always wanted to dissect a cricket.
No! Wait. Wait! Please.
that's more like it.
now tell me, cricket, what is his weakness?
what, uh, what's wrong that you couldn't tell me on the phone?
I did it. I can leave.
you can cross the town line? - Indeed I can.
when I pour...this potion onto the object I hold most dear, that object becomes a talisman that allows me to cross the town line and still remember who I am.
and who you're looking for.
my boy.
what, um, what will you enchant?
well...
this shawl...
is all I have left of my Baelfire.
I don't suppose I could... come with you?
no, I... I... I truly wish you could, but I only have enough of this potion for one object.
this is my journey, Belle.
this is my journey.
I'm afraid it's something I have to do alone.
I know.
there's a fearsome beast ravaging a faraway kingdom.
its eyes burn with fire.
they call it the yaoguai.
no man has been able to kill it, but we will.
there's room on our wagon. Now who's gonna join us?
here. - I will.
now prepare our men.
looking for an adventure?
dreamy, right? - Yes.
I came to thank you.
that advice you gave me last night?
it worked.
Nova and I are running away together.
that... that's wonderful.
why don't you sign up?
I, um... I've always dreamt of heroics, but...
I think it's safer I stick to my books.
they're the only adventures I know that have happy endings.
well, maybe this one'll have one, too.
well, yeah. I doubt it.
last time I faced a beast, you know, it didn't end well.
what are you talking about?
men, follow me.
yaoguai awaits.
get on that wagon.
.Take a chance.
thank you.
wait! Belle, wait.
it's fairy dust. Might come in handy.
no, no. Thank you. I...
I've seen what magic does to people.
you've seen what dark magic does.
fairies use this for good.
now go be a hero.
okay.
uh, sorry. The... the library's not open yet.
Oh, I'm... I'm not here for the books, love.
you. You're the one who broke into my cell at the Queen's palace.
you wanted to kill Rumplestiltskin.
Oh, I still do.
but right now I'll settle for you.
Rumple, I'm... I'm in the elevator.
there's a man here. He broke in. He wants to kill me.
Belle? You're... you're breaking up. Who's in the library?
pirate.
Belle? - A hand. Missing a hand.
Belle? - Hello? No.
what's that? - Uh, a book.
I trust you've seen them before.
you expect to defeat the fiercest creature in the land with a book?
maybe she means to bore it to death.
it will tell us how to find the yaoguai.
these are just scribbles.
it's called another language, and one that I know how to translate.
what?
um, I thought it was just... scribbles.
we're here to protect the land, girl.
if that book tells us where to go, you shall share it with us.
it says we'll find the yaoguai by the lake.
the lake, you say? - Yes.
you heard her, Claude! We're going to the lake!
to the lake.
wait!
don't forget your book!
enjoy the lake!
the yaoguai prefers mountain habitats to all others.
the yaoguai hibernates by day, hunts by night.
please be asleep.
how ever can I thank you?
y... you saved my life.
and you ruined my hunt.
it took me weeks to track the yaoguai here.
Yeah. I found it in a day.
you had luck on your side.
no, not luck. It was this.
I could, uh... I can help you find it again.
you've done enough damage already.
if you really wanna help, stay out of my way.
belle. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
here.
where... where is he? - I don't know.
but you've nothing to fear. I'm here now.
Hey, kid. You hungry?
I managed to wrangle up a pop-tart.
no, thanks.
well, that went well.
Emma, you're doing all you can do.
that's what makes me feel awful.
ladies... the dwarves have been thinking.
we have to ask.
when do we go back? - Back? Where?
the enchanted forest. Our home.
you wanna go back?
we fought really hard to get here.
but with what Regina did to Archie, Storybrooke ain't as safe as we thought.
we're gonna find her. There's only so many places she can hide.
we've dealt with her before. We'll do it again.
but it's not just her. The curse is broken.
there's a whole world full of people beyond the town line that don't know who or what we are.
ever think of what might happen if one of them were to come pay us a visit?
he's right. What if they see, you know, magic?
like a girl turning into a wolf, for example?
folks weren't exactly understanding back in our world.
okay, let's not worry about "what ifs.
no one is here. - Yet.
maybe they come. Maybe they don't.
but that doesn't change the fact that while we might enjoy things like penicillin, we're a bit homesick.
where are you going? - The shop.
Why?
well, let's just say there are many wonderful things in there that I could use to make sure that pirate never comes near you ever again.
Rumple, no. We... we need to report this to the sheriff.
they'll take care of him.
you're so close to finding your son. Please.
please don't let your hatred for this man get in the way of that.
but he tried to harm you.
but why? W... what... what happened between you two?
belle... This is really not your concern.
he attacked me. It most definitely is my concern.
many years ago,
I was married to a woman named Milah...
until Hook crossed our paths.
she was Baelfire's mother? - Yeah.
and because of that marauding cur, he grew up without her.
he took my wife, he took Bae's mother, so I took his hand.
that's why he came after me.
but, uh, what... what about her?
what... what did he do?
Rumple, you can... you can tell me anything.
she died.
that's all that matters.
what happened here?
hook.
this is why he attacked you.
to get you out of the store.
what did he want?
you have it, Mr. Smee?
what is it, Cap'n?
it's the end of the Crocodile's hope.
now he's trapped here.
Rumple! Rumple! Stop it!
stop, please.
no, you're right.
I'll have to retrieve what's mine.
let me... let me help you.
this is my fight. - And this is my fault!
if Hook had never attacked me, you never would have left the shop.
how do you propose that we get the shawl back?
have you dueled with a pirate before?
how exactly are you gonna help me?
well, I'm not just gonna sit here and do nothing!
no. You're gonna go back to the library, lock the door, and wait for me to dispense with this problem.
and if I don't?
you'll... you'll cast some spell that gives me no choice?
no.
I trust you'll do as I wish, as you trust me to be a better man.
belle, please.
hook has maybe cost me the chance of finding my son.
I don't want to lose you, too.
here, look.
I want you to take this...
just in case Hook is stupid enough to come after you again.
point this, pull this trigger, and the gun'll do the rest for you.
all right? All right? - Yeah. Yes. Yes.
W... wait.
promise me that you going after Hook is just about getting the shawl back.
the yaoguai wasn't at the lake.
I'm, uh... I'm sorry. I... I m... I must've misread that one.
see, you know what I think happened?
I think you sent us in the wrong direction on purpose.
let her go.
this isn't your fight, solider.
wait. You're a...
Yeah, I know.
go.
I... didn't expect to see you again.
thank you.
I had to put up with brutes like them when I served in the Emperor's army...
fools who think we have no business holding a sword.
I only wish there was someone there to stand up for me.
you're, uh, you're bleeding.
I'll survive.
the sun should be setting soon.
we need to move out.
what... what... what do you mean,"we"?
you tracked the yaoguai in a matter of hours.
it took me weeks.
you track the beast, and I'll kill it.
I'd be honored to help you.
hook came here on his ship.
leaving town, Mr. Smee?
I spared your life...
and this is how you repay me?
that object you stole from me...
I want it back.
I gave it to Hook.
and where is he? - I don't know.
we... we met on a rooftop.
he didn't tell me anything.
and why would he?
hook knows exactly what you are, Mr. Smee...
a sniveling rat.
now scurry off.
where is it?
found you.
Hello?
H... hello?
down here!
belle! Oh, thank God!
Archie! You're... you... you're... you're okay?!
Yes, I... I... I am. I... I... can... can you, uh...
go. Find Mr. Gold. Tell him I'm here. Bring him back to the ship.
wait. You're not coming with me?
go. Go! Go, go! There's no time to argue.
who's he calling?
you've reached the office of Archibald Hopper.
I'm sorry I can't take your call right now. I'm either with a patient...
or dead.
it's okay, buddy.
things will get better, I promise.
you just... gotta hang in there.
doesn't feel that way.
I know. I know.
how did he get in here?
I brought him.
Marco and I had a chat.
Archie knew how much Henry loves this dog.
we decided he should have him.
that is, if you're up for taking care of him, Henry.
Yeah, I am!
Henry, why don't you take Pongo outside and clean him up?
okay. Come on. Come on, boy! Come on! Let's go! Come on, boy.
all right, look.
I know that there's a lot to work out logistically, but...
no, no, no.
I think giving Pongo to Henry is a great idea.
it's just, four people and a dalmatian in this loft... things might get a little...
cramped. I know. We'll get creative.
or... we could get our own place.
you wanna do what? - You wanna move out?
I... it's just a suggestion.
after 28 years, isn't this what we've all been waiting for, to be together under the same roof?
Yes.
I just... imagined a bigger roof... with turrets.
being here in Storybrooke, we have a chance at a fresh start.
let's take it.
okay.
you looking for this?
uh, that doesn't belong to you.
Oh, it does now.
my dear Belle, you should've stayed with your books.
real life can get so...
messy.
it's just ahead.
you found it. Your books serve you well.
Mulan, your leg's getting worse.
no. I have to protect my village.
you can't even walk.
how... how are you gonna kill the yaoguai?
I'm not.
you are.
me?
I... I'm... I'm... I'm not a soldier.
you have good instincts.
you tracked down that beast faster than I ever could.
uh, tracking it and killing it are not the same thing.
there was once a time when people didn't think that I had what it took either, but I proved them wrong.
how?
by showing them that I had the warrior spirit.
once I found something worth fighting for,
I fought for it with everything that I had. I never gave up.
the fate of my village depends on you.
don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid of you, and I'm not leaving without that.
well, I admire your loyalty. But helping Rumplestiltskin?
I'm afraid you're fighting a lost cause.
he needs that shawl to find his son.
and what makes you think his son wants to be found?
I'm doing that boy a favor.
have you not hurt Rumple enough?
I've hurt him?
you stole his wife.
tell me something, love.
if a woman comes to you and...
begs you to take her away, is that theft?
why would she leave him?
because he was a coward.
and because she loved me.
I should have burned this the moment I acquired it.
why didn't you?
because she made it.
I'm sorry she died, but... vengeance?
vengeance won't bring her back.
died?
like it was some kind of accident. Is that what he told you?
he... well, yeah, he didn't say. - No, of course not.
of course he'd leave out the most important detail of her passing.
and, uh... what would that be?
he killed her.
he ripped out her heart, and he crushed it right in front of me.
no. No! - Oh, yes. Yes.
he will do anything... anything... to hold on to his power.
why do you think anyone who's ever gotten close to him has either run away or been killed?
now what makes you think you're any different?
tell me something, darling.
why would you want to fight for a man like that?
because I still see good in him.
because I believe he's changed.
because his heart is true.
and yours?
yours is rotten.
you have no idea.
how the hell did you...
Oh, I know this ship like the back of my... well, you know.
I'd suggest you give that back to me now.
or what?
you look different in this world, Crocodile.
like the coward I met so long ago, limp and all.
and yet, you still can't kill me.
let's have it, Dark One.
what magic are you gonna hide behind today?
Oh, no. Not magic.
Rumple! Hey, let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
no, not yet, Belle.
this... this is what you came for.
this is what's gonna get you back to Bae.
Ah, you're wasting your breath, love.
he can't resist.
he has to prove that he's not a coward.
you may want to turn away, Belle. This isn't gonna be pretty.
over here! Over here!
you... you're writing something.
save me.
you need help.
let's, uh... let's give this a try, shall we?
the curse... you broke it.
come on.
someone... someone did this to you?
an evil sorceress from my kingdom determined to do everything in her power to keep me apart from Aurora, my true love.
so she exiled me to this land and turned me into a monster.
I tried to warn the villagers, but... no one understood what I really was.
except you.
well, you're not the first beast I've faced.
I am forever in your debt.
please, tell me how I might repay you.
my friend's hurt. She... she needs a doctor.
as do you.
help me bring her back to the village.
it would be my honor.
do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Kill me!
he has to show you how powerful he is.
no. Rumple, this... this is what he wants...
to destroy every bit of good in you.
rip my heart out.
kill me like you did Milah, and then I'll finally be reunited with her.
he has to die, Belle.
No! No, he doesn't!
there's still good in you.
I see it. I've always seen it.
please. Please show me I'm not wrong.
you take your little ship and sail until you fall off the edge of the world.
I never want to see you again.
let's go.
I really liked this one.
I don't know. The yard looks kinda small.
you gonna say that about every house we look at?
I grew up on a farm.
this isn't about the houses, is it?
we buried a friend this morning, Mary Margaret, and it made me realize...
I don't wanna die here.
but our home, David, it doesn't exist anymore.
the ogres are back. Cora's in power.
which is exactly why we need to return.
to make things right. To fight.
I'm tired of fighting!
that's all we've ever done.
we have a chance here, a chance to be together.
but what if we don't belong here?
isn't it worth it to fight for what we really want?
unless we don't want the same thing.
you plotting your escape from Shawshank, kid?
no. They're blueprints.
I had some ideas for what to do if David and Mary Margaret move out.
look.
you wanna make Mary Margaret's room an armory?
Yeah. You know, for weapons and stuff.
to protect us from Regina.
she's not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna let her.
she hurt Archie. What if she wants to take me back?
that's not gonna happen.
what is it?
what happened?
it was Cora. She kidnapped me.
Oh, it's all right. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Henry, we were wrong. Regina didn't do it.
I knew it.
maybe we should let her know. - Yeah.
but something tells me either way, we're gonna pay the price.
this would have been lost if it wasn't for you, Belle.
I would have been lost.
after everything you've learned about me, after everything I've done...
why haven't you given up on me?
I learned a long time ago that when you find something that's worth fighting for, you never give up.
my... my friend's over that ridge. There she is.
belle. You're alive.
I, uh, I did it.
I defeated the yaoguai...
with a little help.
who are you? - I was the yaoguai.
he was cursed. So I helped him. Now he's going to help you.
wait. You're not coming?
I have another beast to face.
good-bye. - Good-bye, Belle.
we haven't been properly introduced.
my name's Phillip.
Mulan.
I'm coming back, Rumple.
isn't that sweet?
still fighting for true love, even to the bitter end.
how did you find me?
you really should be nicer to your traveling companions. Right, Claude?
take her to the tower.
what? No. What are you... what are you doing?
I... I can save him! Just let me go to him.
I... I can break his curse!
you already tried and failed.
that monster's beyond saving.
I'm sparing you a lifetime of pain and misery.
you... you can't keep us apart forever.
I'll fight for him. I'll never stop fighting for him!
okay.
here we go.
it... it worked. - Yes, it did. It did.
now you can find your son.
Oh, Belle, I so wish you were coming with me.
as do I, but...
it doesn't matter.
and why not?
because you'll find him, and when you do, I'll be here waiting for you when you get back.
I wouldn't count on it.
belle! - Who's Belle?
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.
Oh, fear not. She'll live.
she'll just have no idea who you are.
what you've done cannot be undone.
well, now you finally know how it feels!
well, go ahead, Crocodile. Do your worst.
Oh, I intend to.
I was in an accident.
you're not gonna believe what I saw.
if I own that dagger, I control The Dark One.
don't break our deal! - I have to! Papa!
do you remember that favor you owe me, Ms. Swan?
I'm cashing it in.
I need to find my son.
nonstop service to New York City.
I'm nearly finished.
Oh, you learn quickly. - I have a good teacher.
what is it? What brings you home so early?
Milah. My weaving days are behind us.
I've been called to the front.
the ogres war.
I report for training in the morning.
no.
Rumple, I've heard stories. The front... it's a brutal place.
Oh, Milah, I know, I know.
I... I can't say that I... I won't be frightened.
but... but this is the chance I've been waiting for all my life.
you know, I've lived under the shadow of my father's actions for too long now.
just because your father was a coward, it doesn't mean you are.
Oh, I know that.
as do you.
but to the world?
fighting in this war finally gives me the chance to prove that to everyone else.
go.
be brave.
fight honorably.
Oh, God, I love you. - I love you, too.
when you return, we can start living the life we've always dreamed of.
we can have a family. - A family.
what's wrong? This is the right place?
Yes, it is.
let me guess. He's not expecting you.
well, who doesn't love a surprise?
what is it, sweetie?
it's Henry.
Emma left town with Gold, and she took him with her.
and you didn't stop them?
I didn't know until after they had gone.
I'm sure he's safe.
and as soon as Gold's done, Henry will be back.
but not with me.
back? From where?
Where's Rumplestiltskin gone?
I don't know.
well, if he's left town, then he's powerless. He can be killed.
the moment either of us leave, we lose our magic and our advantage.
your memories?
none of us were victims of the curse.
it's not about memories. It's about magic.
well, I don't need magic.
I'll go after him alone.
even if you could find him, do you really think you can just walk up to him and stab him in the heart with your sword?
well, I prefer my hook, but I can't find that now.
you're not going anywhere.
I deserve my vengeance.
you're right. You're right.
you do, and with The Dark One gone, we can search for the one magical item that can actually kill him here...
his dagger.
no Baelfire.
Yeah, that probably wouldn't fly as an alias.
your magic globe didn't give you an apartment number?
it doesn't work that way.
do any of these names mean anything to you?
well, names are what I traffic in, but sadly, no.
here's your boy.
no. Or it could just be vacant.
you might traffic in names and magic, but I traffic in finding people that don't wanna be found, and those sort of folks don't like to advertise their whereabouts.
u. P.S. package for 407.
maybe you should've said Fedex.
he's running.
that... that favor you owe me... this is it.
get him to talk to me.
I... I can't run.
watch Henry. I'll be back.
no.
I don't understand. What are you doing here?
what am I doing here? - Yeah.
I'm not answering anything until you tell me the truth.
are you Gold's son?
what are you talking about? Who's Gold?
you played me. You're from there.
you played me. And he played me. You both played me.
whoa, okay. Emma, slow down. - You and Gold.
what are you talking about? Who's Gold?
your father. Rumplestiltskin.
he's here?
why else would I be in New York?
you brought him to me?! Why would you do that?!
I am the only one allowed to be angry here!
did you know who I was, where I was from, the whole time?
was this just some sort of sick, twisted plan?
did... did you even care about me at all?
Emma, do not... - I wanna know! I want the truth, all of it!
fine!
we... we gotta get off the street. We can't do it here. We're out in the open.
I... I spent a lifetime running from that man. I'm not gonna let him catch me.
there's a bar down the street. We can talk there.
I am not drinking with you. Whatever you're gonna tell me, tell me now.
no, bar's better. Don't worry. You can... keep yelling at me when we get there.
don't worry. Emma's really good at catching people.
well, my son's been running away for a long time now.
now I have a feeling he's equally adept at it.
well, at least we found him, right?
indeed.
Oh, and, uh, thanks for the hot dog. I forgot.
you are quite welcome.
and thank you.
for what?
well, if it wasn't for you bringing Emma to Storybrooke, none of this would have come to pass.
you... are a remarkable young man.
you know... I forgave her.
Emma... for giving me up.
she thought it was the best for me then.
that's why she did it.
I'm sure your son will get it, too.
alas, the circumstances surrounding our separation weren't quite so noble.
but... you're here now.
and you want him back, right?
more than anything.
then that's all that matters.
well, what do you wanna know, Emma? You want the truth? Ask away.
did you know who I was when we met?
if I had, I wouldn't have gone near you.
come on. - "Come on"? Come on, what?
I was in hiding.
I came here to get...
a... away from... all that crap.
so if you didn't know, then you were just using me.
you just needed someone to take the fall for all the watches that you stole.
I wasn't using you.
when we met, I didn't know.
I found out.
how?
when I went to sell the watches...
I ran into a friend of yours... August.
when you see what I have in here, you're gonna listen.
you're gonna believe every word I say.
Yeah, right.
you left me...
and let me go to prison because Pinocchio told you to?
Emma... - I loved you.
I... I was, um, I was tr... I was trying to help you.
by letting me go to jail? - By getting you home.
are you telling me...
that us meeting was a coincidence?
because how the hell did that happen?
if it wasn't in your plan or your father's?
think about it.
he wanted you to break the curse.
us meeting, that could have stopped it.
maybe it was fate. - You believe in that?
you know, there's not a ton about my father that I remember that doesn't suck.
but he used to tell me that there are no coincidences.
everything that happens by design, and there's nothing we can do about it.
forces greater than us conspire to make it happen.
fate, destiny, whatever you wanna call it. The point is...
maybe we met for a reason.
maybe something good came from us being together.
no.
not that I can think of.
I just went to jail. That's it.
doesn't matter now. I'm over it.
and you.
why do you wear the, uh, key chain I got you?
to remind myself never to trust someone again.
come on. I made a deal with your father I'd bring you to him.
you made a deal with him? - Yeah.
and I'm upholding my end.
no, Emma, you don't have to. You know that.
I know.
okay, so this should be really easy for you.
tell him that you lost me. Tell him you can't find me.
you do that... you'll never have to see me again.
soldier.
me?
I'm needed at the front.
you guard this crate with your life.
W... what's under there?
a prisoner who could help us turn the tide against the ogres.
careful. It's a tricky beast.
Yes, sir.
Rumplestiltskin.
you're a child.
please.
I haven't had a sip in days.
how do you know my name?
I'm a seer.
I see all.
no, no, no. That's... that's not possible.
you must have overheard someone speak.
Rumplestiltskin, the son of a coward.
raised by spinsters.
scared of ending up just like his father.
did I overhear that?
I told you. I see all, even what has yet to pass.
you mean the future? You can see the future?
indeed I can... including yours.
no, no, no. I won't indulge this... dark magic.
even if what I see concerns your wife?
Why? Has something happened to her?
give me water.
here. Slake your thirst, witch, then speak of what you know of my wife.
she's already with child.
I'm to be a father?
your wife will bear you a son, but your actions on the battlefield tomorrow will leave him fatherless.
I'm gonna die?
no, no, no. You... you must tell me how I can stop that happening.
you can't.
then I'm done helping you.
for now. Someday you'll help me again.
I'll bet Milah isn't even pregnant.
you just said that so I would give you water, and now you're trying to trick me into deserting.
you shall see. Tomorrow.
when you see the army ride cows into battle, you will know I speak the truth.
cows?
and who's gonna man the catapults? Milk maids?
I have had enough with your fiendish lies.
there is no escaping it.
you will have a son, and your actions will leave him fatherless.
wait. Gold's son is Henry's father?
I know. I know.
and the millions of questions you have, I have, too.
the problem is, it doesn't matter right now because I don't know what to do.
please tell me you're not calling to ask me to tell you to keep it from him.
Henry thinks his father is dead. I told him that for a reason. I wanna protect him.
no matter what this man did,
Henry has a right to know who his father is.
the truth about your parents...
Emma, you of all people should know how important that is.
I don't want Henry to get hurt.
I just wanna protect him.
are you sure this is about protecting Henry and not yourself?
why are you so nervous?
when I found my mom, I was excited.
because I have the benefit of a little more... life experience.
