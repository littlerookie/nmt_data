you are my candy, girl
and you got me wanting you
come on now! Honey - Honey? - Yeah.
Oh, sugar, sugar
damn it! I wish I could shit.
I don't have the slightest inclination, but I know what will happen.
it's gonna be the first shit on the lunar surface.
okay, Al, your turn. - Excuse me?
I don't want to take any time out on the moon.
go down there and try to make a poop.
why are you laughing? You're next.
I didn't know that as commander you had that kind of authority.
he thinks he can control our bowel movements.
on family trips, didn't your mother make you go before you left?
this is the longest damn vacation you boys have ever been on...
and in this vehicle I am your mother.
I want you to work at it. I'm serious.
I'll see what I can do.
fortunately, at this point, we had time to debate such issues.
I'm sure you're dying to know how it all turned out.
once again, this is Emmett Seaborn.
those of you who have been with us all night are going to see quite a treat.
no, they didn't broadcast my bowel movement around the world.
in fact, they didn't broadcast much at all.
here's where my bad luck with the TV cameras comes in.
the color camera aboard Apollo 12 is a substantial improvement...
over the black-and-white unit Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had...
Oh, boy. Look at that.
I was in charge of setting up the TV camera on the tripod...
so that those people who stayed up all night to see a rerun could watch us on the moon.
this would have worked out great had I not accidentally done something that I wasn't supposed to do.
in all our months of training, we never had the actual camera.
all we had was a block of wood.
this procedure needs to be completed in four minutes.
I knew where I was supposed to put it and where the sun would be.
someone probably told me to keep the lens shaded or something.
don't point it at the sun. Set the focus at infinity.
but there were so many things to digest in training to walk on the moon...
I guess I just forgot it.
we have a pretty bright image on the TV.
can you move it or stop it down?
I'll stop it down.
that's as far as it goes, Houston. How does it look to you?
still looks the same. Why don't you try shifting the scene.
how's that? - Looks the same.
we have a bright image at the top...
and then blacked out about eighty percent at the bottom.
that's coming in better. What change did you make?
I hit on the top with my hammer. We didn't have a thing to lose.
skillful fix. - Yeah. I hit it with this hammer.
that's skilled craftsmanship. Let me try it again.
we're still not getting a good picture, and you're running a tad behind.
press on and we'll try to get back to it later if we have time.
Houston, let me move it around so the back is to the sun.
maybe that will help.
when all was said and done, nothing happened.
it's hard to get a TV repairman to make a house call in Anytown, USA...and impossible, of course, on the moon.
the vidicon tube was fried beyond repair...
so that was the end of color TV from the Ocean of Storms.
they probably knew on the ground exactly what I had done wrong...
but nobody wanted to say anything.
from Houston, this is Emmett Seaborn.
I just hope I didn't disappoint anyone.
what the fuck happened up there?
forget it. Let's go.
what happened was I had screwed up.
not even Dick, who was stuck in orbit while we explored the surface.
but flying solo in Yankee Clipper was considered more important than being the commander's sidekick on the moon.
got it. Lock inner mast. Lock outer mast.
extend locked legs. We've done that.
I clearly remember the last moments we spent before we separated.
we could have never gotten down there or home again if it weren't for that man.
in all the time we trained together...
Dick Gordon never once showed resentment when people would introduce me as "the guy who was going to the moon with Pete Conrad.
never a trace of sarcasm. Never an ironic remark.
he was in line for a command of his own.
he was holding out to walk on the moon on Apollo 18.
unfortunately, there never was an Apollo 18...
so this was as close as he ever got.
I guess we gotta close her up now.
I wish this son of a bitch fit three people.
at that moment, with all the challenges ahead of us...
all I could think was one thought:
sure hope I see you again.
nervous?
how did we get out here anyway?
I just hope I can find a place to land.
and I hope I can set it down all right.
you'll do fine.
you'll do just fine.
just don't bring her in too low, too fast.
thanks a lot.
I'm just trying to help. - Thanks very much.
you know I'm here for you. - I know you are. Big help.
unlike Neil and Buzz...
our mission called for us not just to land wherever the ground looked good.
on 11, they were lucky to land almost three miles from where they had planned.
but we had a target...
which had been waiting for us in the Ocean of Storms for two years:
an unmanned probe named Surveyor 3.
if future missions were gonna explore the moon in depth...
Apollo 12 would have to demonstrate a precise touchdown was possible.
forty-two feet. Coming down at three. Start the clock.
forty. Coming down at two.
looking good. Thirty-two.
thirty feet. Down at two.
plenty of gas, babe. Hang in there. Eighteen feet.
coming down at two. He's got it made.
come on in there. Twenty-four feet.
contact light.
shit.
pro! - Yeah!
okay, engine arm off.
you got your commander light off? - Yep.
I'll cycle the main shutoff valve. - Okay.
good landing. Outstanding.
that was incredible.
Yeah!
Houston, we're in real good shape.
you guys did outstanding targeting.
that thing was right down the middle. Beautiful!
way to go.
look out there. Isn't it beautiful? - Man, that's beautiful.
that is something else. That is amazing.
unbelievable. - Oh, my God.
you want to ask them? - Yeah. All right.
Houston, lntrepid.
go, Intrepid.
where are we?
by all the numbers and delta vectors and crater sightings...
it looked like we were right where we wanted to be.
but it wasn't until Dick made a flyover pass...
that we found out how good a job Pete had done bringing us down.
Houston, I have Snowman.
I believe I have the LEM on the northwest corner of
I have Intrepid.
he's the only thing that casts a shadow down there.
he's on the Surveyor crater about a third of the way on the Surveyor crater to the head of the snowman.
and I have Surveyor.
Roger, Clipper. Good eyeball. Well done.
ed, it's almost as good as being there.
almost.
Pete had done it.
with the help of the targeting people on the ground...
he had proven that pinpoint accuracy was possible when landing on the moon.
he had set down our lunar module a stone's throw away from our primary mission objective
a short moon walk of about 200 yards
just like he said he would.
not long after that...
sometime very early in the morning back in Houston...
Pete Conrad proved something else.
he proved to me and the world just how eloquent a man he can be.
Charles "Pete" Conrad, Jr.
only the third human being to set foot on the moon.
who can forget Neil Armstrong's immortal words.
let's watch and listen to the words Conrad has chosen to mark this moment in history.
that may have been a small one for Neil, but it's a long one for me.
there you have it.
after training with him for months, we'd all become accustomed to Pete's colorful use of language.
you stupid
this thing's about to piss me off.
I finally get the cocksucker turning, then it locks up again.
I'm spending more time trying to turn these frigging bolts than any goddamn else thing.
Goddamn. Son of a-- Cocksucker. Goddamn it.
turn around and give me a big smile.
I had a special moment for myself to mark my getting to the moon.
when you are selected to become a member of the astronaut corps...
you wear a special silver pin.
it gets replaced by a gold pin when you actually fly a mission.
I had worn my silver pin for six years.
being selected for Apollo 12, I wouldn't be needing it anymore.
I wanted to put it in a special place where it would rest forever.
what better place than in the Ocean of Storms.
I joined NASA in the third group of 14 astronauts in 1963.
so did Dick Gordon who flew with Pete in Gemini 11.
while he and the rest of the group were jockeying for seats on lunar landing flights...
I was assigned to the Apollo Applications Program...
the space station which came to be known as Skylab.
Pete called it "Tomorrowland.
planning things so far in the future...
who knew if they'd ever become a reality or not.
while I was tucked away in some far-off corner...
it seemed everyone else was assigned mission after mission.
I sort of felt like the forgotten man.
but I kept an eye on what my peers were doing.... all the guys I used to commiserate with about not getting to fly.
Walt Cunningham made the crew of Apollo 7.
bill Anders, Apollo 8.
rusty Schweickart, Apollo 9.
that left just me.
but there were others from our group that were not so fortunate.
Ted Freeman was flying his T-38 at a couple hundred miles per hour...
when a goose smashed in the Plexiglas of his cockpit.
he was killed.
Charlie Basset died along with Elliot See...
when Elliot crashed into a building at the McDonnell plant in St. Louis.
Roger Chaffee was on the crew of Apollo 1...
killed in the fire with Gus Grissom and Ed White.
then there was C. C. Williams.
he was supposed to be the original lunar module pilot on Apollo 12 along with Pete and Dick.
he had spent the night before our astronaut physicals jumping up and down to compress his spine.
there was a six-foot height limit, and C. C. was a shade over six feet even.
he was a superb astronaut who impressed everyone he met...
but C. C. was killed when his T-38 went into a spin over the swamps of Tallahassee.
he had been cruising at 24, 000 feet when his controls locked...
and the plane went into a steep dive.
he didn't have time to bail out.
at that point, I wasn't even hoping to fly Apollo anymore.
it just hurt too much to think about it.
but I guess somebody was looking out for me.
somebody named Pete Conrad.
al, you got a minute?
Hi, Pete. Sure. What can I do for you?
I just talked to Deke.
how'd you like to go to the moon with Dick and me?
do you think you can give up all this excitement?
you okay?
you're on board.
Mm-hmm.
it was such a shock...
it took some time to really sink in.
once on the moon, I had little time to think about such things.
I heard once the real cost of us being there...
was about a million dollars for each minute.
Pete and I did our best to stretch every penny of America's money.
we're not just astronauts.
suddenly, we're meteorologists, seismologists...
geologists, geochemists, you name it.
Pete and Al, Houston.
looks like you did your job. We're getting data back.
we're picking up your heavy footsteps going by the seismometer.
it's great. - Our bosses couldn't see us...
but now they knew how fast we were working.
man, are you dirty. This is dirt dirt.
remember how they took care of these experiments?
in training you needed gloves to touch them.
tell them it's important to keep the experiments free of dust.
Dr. Wilson asks you guys not to forget to keep the connectors and experiments free of dust.
Roger.
dirt or no dirt, everything worked fine.
while we were laughing and chatting away...
poor Dick was trying to get work done.
okay, Clipper. You did not copy all of that PAD. ls that affirm?
ed, if you want to talk to me, you'll have to take it off relay...
so Pete and Al won't cut you out.
it's impossible to hear anything with those guys yakking.
there were so many things for us to remember to do on the moon...
that we needed some kind of cheat sheet that would always be within reach.
both of us had drafted a checklist to wear on our sleeves...
but the actual flight item was made up by the ground crew just before launch...
and put in our suits without our even seeing them...
until we were on the moon.
thanks to Dave Scott and the rest of our backup crew...
we had a little extra reading to do.
look at your checklist.
that's the terrain for me!
with a 30-minute extension to our EVA...
I was able to get the core sample tube in and out of the ground.
Pete and I got up our first load of moon rocks.
we dusted each other off, then I started back up the ladder.
just like that, the first of my two four-hour moon walks was over.
it's impossible to truly appreciate something when it's happening.
I suppose I had flashes of thought like: "How did I get to the moon?
but if you put yourself in my place...
your head would be filled with so many checklists and procedures...
that all you could do, really, was look at the panel readouts...
upon which your life depends...
feeling bad about that lost TV camera.
it wasn't the reason we came to the moon.
I know we're all human and we mess up...
but I sure felt bad about it.
Pete and Dick are more typical of the astronaut personality:
unflappable, confident, fun loving.
as for me, one out of three ain't bad.
we did have fun together.
we were the most close-knit of any crew that ever flew.
Pete even got us matching gold Corvettes...
customized for our positions on the crew:
cdr for commander...
and LMP for me, the lunar module pilot.
those men were then and still are my best friends.
if you're gonna do all this work to get to the moon, it should be fun.
I probably should have taken a sleeping pill, but that wasn't manly.
finally, I was able to put work aside...
allow myself a moment of peace, a moment of calm.
finally, I got to sleep.
that doesn't sound right.
it's okay.
no warning lights.
the cabin pressure is okay. - It's the cooling pump.
helium regulator's nominal. It's not the burst disk.
it's the cooling pump. lt's okay. - Yeah?
cooling pump? - Yeah.
I guess you're right.
I am.
back to sleep.
since you're up-- - Yeah? What?
I've been awake for a while. - You have?
why didn't you say anything? -This neck ring is cutting into my neck.
the cocksucker is killing me.
they snugged up my boot too tight, and it's pulling on the one side.
we have to re-lace it.
now that we were up, I started thinking about the EVA to come:
our second and last.
we were planning to take a very historic photo using a special timer we had snuck on board.
hurry up. - Let's go.
come on. Sit down. - You got it set up?
all the photographs from Apollo 11 were of Buzz taken by Neil...
one astronaut with maybe the other guy reflected in his visor.
we had the idea to use this timer and get both me and Pete in the picture...
it was a great idea. - Electric man.
the trick was finding the right moment so Houston wouldn't catch on.
by the time we made it to the Surveyor...
we had less than an hour left outside in the Ocean of Storms.
our first order of business was that secret photo.
I had practiced finding the timer plenty of times and never had trouble.
I had the whole procedure down to a few seconds.
the result would have been magnificent.
had I been able to find the damn thing.
I'll be darned.
isn't it in there? - Let me look one more time.
wait. What's in your bag here?
it's just a film magazine. - I'll try at this end.
I knew I was wasting precious time.
if it didn't turn up quick, it would be criminal to continue the search.
so-- - I've had it.
forget it. - All right.
let's mosey down there and grab what we came here for.
in 1967, Surveyor's TV camera had broadcast the first-ever television pictures from the surface of the moon.
we aimed to take that camera home...
so they could study the long-term effects of the moon on manmade machines.
getting it would mean we had completed all of our mission objectives.
we got her.
I got it.
got something for you.
after more than three hours of hard work on the moon...
I probably wasn't the most imaginative person.
had I been thinking fully...
that's when we would have taken the picture with that timer.
we could have shook hands standing in front of lntrepid.
it would have been a great picture, but I didn't think of it.
there was just one last thing to do.
none of us had forgotten the reason I was privileged enough to be there.
we made it, C. C.
we left C. C.'s wings on the lunar surface.
he's the reason there's four stars on our mission patch, not just three.
then that was it.
our walk on the moon was officially over.
I had spent seven hours and 45 minutes walking on the moon.
in a person's lifetime, that's nothing but a blink.
but what my eyes witnessed there at the Ocean of Storms still fuels me...
still fills me with a sense of wonder that is hard to put into words.
what a neat ride!
al said it was okay. So was the flag.
Neil and Buzz's ascent had knocked the crap out of their flag.
they could send a man to the moon, but they couldn't think to place the flag 50 feet away from a rocket engine...so it wouldn't get blown over.
check our range and range rate. - Okay.
intrepid, Houston.
you are ten seconds to LOS.
we'll pick you up again at 142: 21: 31 through honeysuckle.
Roger, Houston. We'll see you on the other side.
what do you say?
want to take a minute and fly this vehicle?
even though I was called the lunar module pilot...
the only way I'm supposed to fly the LEM is in an emergency.
you got it. - I got it.
some people might want the commander to fly all the time.
some commanders might do just that.
how's it feel? - It feels real good.
Oh, man. lt's better than the sim. - A lot better.
Yeah. lt really feels great.
it's unbelievable. Man.
I don't know if anyone in Houston would have criticized Pete...
but we were on the far side of the moon.
and they had no way of knowing.
so, for a few moments on Apollo 12...
the lunar module pilot actually piloted the lunar module...
thanks to my good friend, Pete Conrad.
howdy, fellows!
Jesus! Did you have to bring back half the moon with you?
you ain't messing up my nice, clean spacecraft.
strip down and wipe yourselves off before you come in here.
I mean it. Go.
he's right. You're filthy.
welcome home, fellows.
can I get you anything to drink? Water? Any beverage at all?
careful not to flip any breakers with anything hanging out.
attitude: dead minimum.
when we were out of our suits...
we had to strap in and jettison the lunar module.
spacecraft control SCS. - All right.
we're all set to jettison the LEM in about a minute.
you know, if we were to lose the hatch...
when we blow the LEM...
and one day someone was to find us floating around up here like this...
they might be pretty confused.
at least we'll go out of this world the same way we came in.
you two.
you didn't come into the world in that suit?
man, I hope not.
after a day of lunar orbit photography...
getting stereo photos of possible landing sights for Apollo 13 and 14...
and when every piece of equipment was stowed...
and checked off the flight plan...
we prepared for the big burn that would take us home.
hrb forward, check.
all right. We're just waiting for the DSKY.
I feel sort of like that song:
is That All There ls?
I was just thinking the exact same thing.
not that it wasn't amazing.
just that the whole experience didn't feel like a headline.
it was real, and I had lived it.
falling through the sky after a trip to the moon is no more surreal an experience than getting there in the first place or walking on its surface.
it's just one more step, one more planned event...
that comes about because of science and imagination and effort.
you can go through all the manuals...all the procedures and checklists...all the graphs and blueprints that show how it's possible to do what we did...
you might be impressed that such a complicated thing was even attempted.
so impressed even that you wouldn't realize that the three people who made the journey and undertook all the challenges contained within it...
were, in essence...not that much different from yourself.
damn, that shower feels good. - When it doesn't feel that good...you'll know you're officially home from the moon.
they should let us out of here. I don't have any diseases.
me neither. I just want to grab me some cajun food and a couple of beers.
how about you, Al? You back from the moon yet?
Yeah, I'm back.
I'm back from the moon.
what are you laughing at? - Yeah. What's so funny?
I don't think I'll ever forget...
when all that good stuff was lighting up...
and then CAPCOM called up SCE to auxiliary.
I didn't know what the hell that meant...
all I hear is Al Bean's voice, two octaves higher than normal...
saying, "I know what it is.
the best record of what it was like to have gone to the moon and return...
is not in the tangible evidence of the endeavor.
it's not in the things we took or brought back.
it wouldn't have been in the TV footage we never got...
which I beat myself up over for half the mission.
it's in the individual consciousness and vision of the human beings who made the trip.
people like Dick Gordon, Pete Conrad and even me.
my, that sun is bright.
it feels good.
let's go. - Yeah.
in the end, what I have left are memories.
almost like it was a trip to the seashore...
or a drive in the country.
they mix together in a constant stream of thoughts and images that come and go...like all memories do.
the most precious things I brought back with me were the same things I left with: my two best friends.
I realize when you go through any endeavor, any journey...
whether across town or to the moon and back...
all that matters is sharing the experience with people that you love.
that's what makes life special.
because, ultimately, that's all there is.
that's really all there is.
there's a place up ahead and I'm going
come away Come away if you're going
leave the sinking ship behind
Adele Crawford and her son,
Roger.
found dead in their Los Feliz home seven years ago.
says here her husband was on a plane to China for a business trip at the time of death.
but he had filed for divorce.
and after his wife and kid were found murdered, he didn't have to pay alimony or child support.
and he remarried four months later.
any signs of forced entry?
that should be right here.
uh, wait a minute.
there should be a whole nother box.
I must have left it down in records -- damn.
good morning, Chief.
good morning, everyone.
don't stop working on my account.
I don't remember Chief Thompson ever coming down here.
that's because he didn't.
Mm-hmm?
Oh. Chief.
chief Delk.
what a surprise.
what can I do for you?
over the last two months, 11 medical marijuana dispensaries have been robbed at gunpoint.
and Robbery/Homicide is no closer to finding the perpetrators than they were on day one.
Mm. Apparently, they're finding it hard to care about this little crime spree.
which is why I'm now assigning their investigation to your division.
Oh, uh, you may not be aware, but, um, we just picked up a case from Chief Pope.
the Crawford murder's seven years old.
it can wait a few more days.
you really think these robberies are that important?
armed robberies.
they may not have the violent impact of some of your regular cases, but if we don't stop them soon, they will.
Hey. This is nothing new.
every incoming Chief tries to be hands-on...
we know the pattern
one Chief centralizes everything...
then the next one tears it apart.
major Crimes could be on his hit list.
weren't you going down to records to get that box you forgot?
I'm going. I'm going.
there's an awful lot of material here.
but the basics never change.
the same three guys using the same M. O. at each dispensary.
uh, you're not concerned that we will be playing catch-up with Robbery/Homicide?
Robbery/Homicide, Counterterrorism,
major Crimes
I've always had my doubts about these specialized divisions.
people standing around waiting for a crime that matches the name of their department.
and with our hiring freeze,
I need every work hour to be well spent, even if I have to move people to do it
like, say, uh, you.
m-Me? Move me? Move me where?
I like to have people in their proper places.
you, for example, would make an excellent Assistant Chief of Operations.
that's Will Pope's job.
and I'd like someone with more hands-on experience in his position.
we may have elite divisions, Chief Johnson, but we don't have elite problems.
my idea of a Major Crime differs from that of Will Pope.
so now we're doing robberies?
armed robberies, Lieutenant.
11 in a row by the same 3 men.
that doesn't sound like a major crime to you?
now, let's take a look at the pattern.
our 3-man team, all wearing motorcycle helmets, hits a medical marijuana dispensary once every three to four days.
so we're due right now, Chief.
Yeah, they target dispensaries with light security -- they rush in in the morning before customers get in their way.
I have video up of the last robbery.
our robbers wait just out of view of the security cameras until someone comes out, then they go in.
the two with pistols cover the staff.
then the third comes in and covers the camera with gold spray paint.
why wait for someone to leave?
why don't they just enter directly?
most marijuana dispensaries have electronic security doors that only unlock from the inside.
and you know this because...
my mom has a prescription for pot.
what's wrong with her?
insomnia and glaucoma.
I-I have to guide her to the door sometimes.
ever buy anything?
how do you think he got the name "Buzz"?
very funny.
no, Lieutenant, you can't shop for pot unless you have a prescription from a doctor and a photo I. D.
and, uh, does your mother claim that this maryjane actually helps her?
I don't know, but she sleeps all the time, and she doesn't complain anymore...
...About anything.
well
okay, so their pattern is every three or four days.
what else do these 11 stores have in common?
other than free love and patchouli oil?
um, Chief, they're all cash heavy and with lots of inventory.
I mean, after each robbery, the dispensaries are reporting losses in the five figures and 10 to 15 pounds of pot missing.
what's the street value of medical marijuana?
$5, 000 to $20, 000 a pound, and there are always buyers.
hmm. Better than robbing a bank.
and I've checked all the witness statements, Chief.
and even though our robbers were wearing motorcycle helmets, no one actually saw a motorcycle leave the scene.
okay, so all the victims of these robberies
Victims"?!
don't you mean "Drug dealers"?
lieutenant, these dispensaries are considered legal by the state.
we are sworn to protect them. - Bull.
Hey. What happened to our cold case?
uh, Chief Delk put it back in the freezer.
and he assigned us to a string of armed robberies at marijuana dispensaries.
Oh?
anyone tell Pope?
Delk is changing the definition of Major Crimes.
he's blurring the lines between you and Robbery/Homicide, and not only that, he's targeting me, too.
well, he won't fire you.
he could demote me to Commander, which cuts my pension and puts me at the same rank as Taylor.
that can't happen.
well, do you have any outside offers?
uh, yeah, some.
Yeah, New York, Chicago -- all private sector.
better money, of course.
but nothing here.
I can't move out of state with my kids unless their mother goes, too.
why are you asking me about my other offers?
did Delk say something?
did he outright offer you my job?
why would you even say that?
because he likes you...
obviously, and taking you off a case that I gave you
that's a pretty clear indication my time at the L. A.P. D. has come to a close.
regardless, it is imperative that your division clear up these armed robberies.
Why?
a failure in a case like this would be just the excuse Delk needs to break up Major Crimes.
which, right now, is a vital part of my resume.
Yeah. Come in.
excuse me, Chief. Uh...
we have another robbery at a dispensary, and this one came with a murder.
of course it did.
uh, we'll handle this.
we will.
Hey, Chief. Gold spray paint.
just like the other robberies.
well, our 3-man team, all wearing motorcycle helmets, busted in here an hour ago.
that sad sack over there in the corner, that's Sam Dodson, co-founder of this little weed stand.
commander Taylor, would you babysit Mr. Dodson for a moment, please?
thank you. Commander Taylor...
lieutenant Flynn, one name on the sign-in sheet for today -- John Park.
maybe he's the man who let in our robbers.
I'll go find him, Chief. Thank you.
uh, Chief, here.
watch -- watch --watch the glass, huh?
all right.
now, there was no camera found in this room, which means at least they were smart enough not to tape their drug deals.
the body?
right in here.
meet who used to be Shea Collins.
chief Thomas Delk.
what in the hell is he doing here?
chief.
I told you this was a major crime.
and you were right.
you were going to tell us about the victim, Lieutenant.
right.
Shea Collins, Chiefs.
um, 36 years old.
co-owned this dispensary with Sam Dodson, who is in the lobby.
two shots -- one to the chest, one to the head,
Collins goes down here.
9mm casings over here, and the shooter was standing right...Here.
excuse me, Chief.
no. Excuse me.
I should have put you on this case days ago.
my instincts were right.
my timing was wrong. I'm sorry.
uh, no need to apologize.
the M. O. is the same as the other robberies?
uh, yes...
except for the murder, which you predicted.
I'm gonna head in and, uh, talk to the witness, see what he has to say.
pardon me, sir.
chief, Sam Dodson, the co-owner.
um, I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Dodson...
and I know that this is a bad time, but could you walk us through what happened today?
Yeah, we opened at 11: 00 a. m. and right after our first customer left, three guys wearing motorcycle helmets jammed guns in our faces.
one of them took the money, and the other two went in the stockroom.
and I was on the floor, facedown on the ground, uh, like they told me.
but Shea
he just went crazy.
he was screaming, fighting.
and, uh...
they shot him...
twice.
I did nothing to help him.
what did the robbers take from the store today?
um, $50, 000 cash, and we normally keep about 20 pounds of product on hand.
chief.
found this flier on the front desk. - Thank you.
I know the police think we're all a bunch of stoners.
I have an MBA, okay?
Shea was a cannabis expert.
I mean, that's why people came here
for Shea's Lounge.
what the hell is that?
Shea's Lounge? Uh...
Shea's Lounge
it's our showpiece strain.
nobody else had it.
it's a 40% indica, 60% sativa hybrid.
it's like a cross between Skywalker and super skunk with a little ruderalis thrown in to reinforce the thc content.
Shea created it.
did he apply for the nobel prize?
it says here, "Beware of anyone "Coming in at night, "Talking on their cell and browsing for a while "Without buying anything.
they'll be back the next morning to rob you"?
W-why? Is that a problem?
well, this is information the L. A.P. D. didn't have.
if the robbers were casing stores
it was just a theory that Shea came up with by talking to other dispensary owners.
I always thought he was being a little paranoid, but...
I guess that's what happens when you're under attack with no police assistance.
Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Dodson.
the L. A.P. D. has handled this case seriously from the beginning.
thank you, Commander.
why don't you go tell the press what I'm gonna tell Mr. Dodson?
we have Major Crimes, our most elite division, working this investigation, and we will solve this case.
uh, Chief Delk, in order to make good on that promise,
I'm gonna need two things
and that is a forensic botanist and a sealed crime scene.
you want to seal this place and post an officer outside 'round the clock?
that seems drastic and expensive.
well, I'm trying to do what you want, which is solve this case in a hurry.
so I need someone who can distinguish between different strains of marijuana.
I also need a sealed crime scene
fine.
fine.
Mr. Dodson...
I'm sorry, but you're not going to have access to your store for a few days.
you're using this tragedy as an excuse shut us down.
Oh, please.
the L. A.P. D. has already wasted enough time protecting you hippies and your maryjane.
lieutenant Provenza! Lieute
I'd like to speak to you for a moment, please.
did you just say "Hippies" And "Maryjane"?
Yes, I did.
how old are you?
six Chiefs and counting, which is how I know that if you deal drugs, you vastly increase your chances you'll end up dead.
I'm low on sympathy here.
that's too bad.
because as of now, you're the L. A.P. D. liaison to the medical-marijuana community for the rest of this investigation.
what? - And I expect you to meet with the dispensary owners this evening and educate them about today's events.
you can't be serious.
do I look high to you?
we think this might be the guy checking out the stores before the robbery.
entered last night. Used a fake name to sign in.
talks on the phone. Didn't buy anything.
he's practically wearing a burka.
he looks Caucasian.
generic clothes.
probably not a gang member, Chief.
if he's casing the place, his phone may be on video mode.
but I can't enlarge it enough to see.
he's probably photographing the placement of the security cameras.
buzz, could you get to the robbery footage, please?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry. They never shut off the cameras.
I have to fast-forward through the whole night.
can we watch both videos side by side?
okay, there. Pause.
the guy from the night before is the same physical type as our spray painter.
and he's wearing the same cowboy boots.
so the flier's right.
this man cases the store, and then, the next morning, he's the first one in and sprays the cameras.
and here's the footage from the exterior camera.
pause it there.
this is our guy from this morning's sign-in sheet, John Park, opening the door for the robbers.
chief.
lieutenant Flynn picked John Park up at his house about an hour ago.
he's 27 years old and temps as a graphic artist when he...works at all.
what's going on in there?
well, Lieutenant Provenza is briefing the dispensary owners on today's events.
see, Provenza? A lot of them aren't hippies.
Yeah, well, I promise you, Tao, in every one of their closets, somewhere, there's a tie-dyed shirt.
uh, which interview room is Mr. Park in?
Neither...apparently, Mr. Park wanted some...snacks.
lieutenant, is he...
as a kite. -Great.
Hi!
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, L. A.P. D.
no, thank you.
um, may I ask you why you need a prescription for medical marijuana?
anxiety.
I used to be, like, tense.
and was there a cause for this stress?
Oh, yeah.
a year ago, I was managing a Kinkos.
and then I got laid off.
thrown back into the rat race.
couldn't sleep.
a-and what brought you in to the dispensary this morning?
Oh, I woke up feeling... Blah.
I just wanted to grab a brownie and put on my thinking cap.
I was gonna get three, 'cause I really wanted to relax.
but Shea said that half of one would do the trick, and I shouldn't be wasteful.
but it was just so delicious.
I went outside, and I ate the whole thing.
God, Shea is dead!
what is that like?
he threatened to kick me out once.
he was a cool cat, though.
he invented Shea's Lounge.
Shea's Lounge.
get it? Like...
...the thing.
what I'm most interested in is what happened after you left the store.
I went across the street to get a sandwich.
it was a Turkey and avocado.
I sat on the curb to eat it.
and...it had cilantro.
will you forget the sandwich?
we're interested in the guys with the motorcycle helmets who you let in the store on your way out.
Oh, the guys with the motorcycle helmets. - Yeah.
well, what about them?
you saw three men with motorcycle helmets run right past you.
did you not find that odd?
I just thought they were safety conscious.
it is kind of weird that they were wearing helmets in the car, though.
you saw them leave in an automobile?
Yeah, uh, an old one.
it was orange, like a big ball of fire.
those guys were in a hurry, too.
and gunshots.
loud!
okay. You know what?
I'm gonna ask you what may seem like a really stupid question.
there are no stupid questions.
Oh, thank you...
so much.
uh, did you get the license plate off the car?
what car?
the orange one, that looked like a big ball of fire.
Oh, you saw that, too!
did you get the plate or not?!
Yeah. Yeah. I got the plate.
it said..."California.
uh, pardon me.
chief, one of the so-called dispensary owners says that a guy came into his store tonight, was looking around while he was talking on his phone, then he left without buying anything.
but their M. O.'s every three or four days.
I know that, Chief. I know.
that's the reason I showed the owner the surveillance tapes we had from last night.
positive I. D. wearing exactly the same hat and glasses.
okay. They're escalating.
first the murder, now they're breaking the pattern.
tomorrow morning, they are going to rob that store.
what's this all about?
first, I'm gonna tell you something...
that will make you happy.
your forensic botanist has been requisitioned, and we're flying him in from Washington for your murder.
next...
I'm gonna tell you something that will make us both happy.
I heard, from a very reliable source, that Delk...
offered you the job of Assistant Chief.
Congratulations.
what's wrong?
well, champagne's for celebrating, and there's nothing to celebrate.
Joel!
Joel, that food's not for you!
for heaven's sakes.
I don't know who your reliable source is, but Delk didn't offer me Will's job.
Really?
because my reliable source is Delk.
well, then, he's not as reliable as you think.
you know, if it weren't for Will bringing me out here, we wouldn't even be married.
I think a little gratitude would be nice.
are you kidding me?
that's like saying you and I wouldn't be together if my ex-wife hadn't divorced me.
you want to give her a call and say "Thanks"?
I would never call Elaine in a million years.
Cindy." "Cindy." For God's sake, my ex-wife's name is Cindy.
I don't even know anyone named Elaine!
well, whatever Delk told you,
I'm not even in contention for Will's job until I arrest three homicidal robbers.
Yeah, that's not what Delk says.
well, who are you gonna believe -- me or Delk?
why do you want me in Will's job so badly anyhow?
because I don't want you chasing robbers and other heavily armed criminals anymore.
and if you were Assistant Chief of Operations,
I wouldn't have to spend so much time worrying about you
like I will all day tomorrow while you're staking out some pot shop, waiting for a bunch of murderers to strike again.
why can't you let the undercover detectives handle this?
because I want these guys alive, and S. I.S. Shoots first and asks questions never.
and I'll be sitting in a surveillance van the whole time anyhow.
and the surveillance van is gonna be parked three blocks away?
ah -- and the surveillance van is going to be parked
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
the surveillance van will be parked three blocks away.
thank you.
thank you.
can we move the van a little closer?
not without going inside.
okay, Buzz.
l. A.P. D. appreciates you letting us use your store for public-safety reasons.
we shouldn't be here too long.
Oh, looky here.
well our witness was right.
all right, look sharp, everyone.
we've got company.
thank you, Lieutenant.
let's keep our guests comfortable.
detective Sanchez, go ahead and open the store.
lieutenant Tao, you're up.
and now Tao's gonna show us if his theory about our robbers using an innocent customer to let them in is true.
you guys ready?
ready as we're gonna be.
I think we have a problem.
detective Gabriel, buzz him in.
but be careful -- he could be one of their crew.
Ben Schwartz.
Ben Schwartz.
welcome to Kind Buds.
come on back.
thank you.
Ben -- it's not
do I have to type in his full name?
does it matter if he's a Benjamin or a Bennett?
here. Let me.
no, no, no, no.
I should do the typing.
chief, I do this all the time.
just give me one second. Okay?
what's better -- the razzmatazz or the gypsy's dreams?
the razzmatazz flips you upside down and bends your mind with color.
you know what I mean?
but the gypsy's dreams
it's more like... "I'm going to the supermarket, "But really I'm on an epic journey of self-discovery" Kind of ride.
Yeah, but they both get you pretty high.
Oh, look at that.
okay, no criminal record for Mr. Schwartz, so he's most likely not part of their crew.
lieutenant Tao, go ahead and exit the store.
his helmet is on, so they'll be coming in on the next exit.
when our innocent bystander,
Mr. Schwartz, comes out, make sure you get him out of harm's way.
will do, Chief.
customer is on his way out.
here we go.
get on the ground! Okay, okay, okay!
all right! All right! All right!
get down!
this better not be like yesterday.
we're here to see it's not.
this place is aces!
Oh, my God!
this stash is huge!
come on. Come on, guys. Come on!
get the car started!
first suspect's leaving.
go, go, come on.
okay, wait for it.
wait for it.
go, go, go.
careful, careful.
get down!
show me your hands!
Oh, that was really well done, everyone!
I think we're good!
I hear congratulations are in order.
who'd you hear that from?
commander Taylor.
how else do we hear about anything in this building?
just back from ballistics with the guns the robbers were using.
and I'm afraid I have bad news.
the guns don't match?
I'm afraid I have really bad news.
here, Chief. Take this.
chief Delk?
please take mine.
not to worry.
just a little demonstration.
it's Tao.
he could give us a warning next time.
the window's fine.
look! Window's fine!
the guns are fake.
the guns are fake!
Oh, Chief Delk.
transition going well?
always a few bumps in the road.
change takes time.
well, I'm here if you need me.
thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
somebody mentioned there were some complications with the ballistics on Chief Johnson's murder investigation.
the main complication was not putting Major Crimes on the case earlier.
well, now that you've altered their charter, that shouldn't be a problem again.
anyway, you're right. Ballistics don't match.
but a forensic botanist confirmed the killers possessed a small amount of Shea's Lounge.
that's a unique plant sold only at our victim's store.
so I don't even need to hear these guys say they did it.
well, you may not, but Chief Johnson will.
all right, our spray painter's name is A. J. Clark.
and he had no rap sheet up until today.
he's been unemployed for 18 months, but before that, he worked as a prop master, so he'd have access to dozens of different guns through different armories serving the film industry.
the other two guys with the fake guns are unemployed stunt men
Greg Lapham and Lou Wilson.
between the two of them, a couple B&E's
and an assault.
look.
they've been mirandized.
we have enough evidence to book them all for murder.
Yeah, but not to make it stick.
one of them had a real gun yesterday, and I need to find it.
line them up, please.
you got it, Chief.
Hello, Greg.
I'm deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I want a lawyer.
you're sitting right here.
Lou, I'm Deputy Chief
one word...
lawyer.
I want one.
I-- - Stop! Just listen.
before you say anything, you should know that your friends are being very cooperative.
there's three of you, and I got one deal to cut.
do you want it or not?
the other guys are... Talking?
at this very moment.
and how I file against y'all with the D. A.
depends on which one of you is the most truthful.
Mr. Clark...
how well do you trust your partners?
because unlike them, you were caught blue-handed, and Detective Sanchez and Lieutenant Flynn are interviewing them right now.
how's your interview going?
good. How's yours? - Good.
how do the three of y'all know each other?
I worked props on a tv show -- "Cop Lawyer, M. D.
and Greg and Lou did stunts.
we all thought it was kind of a lock.
lasted two episodes.
a year and a half later, I still wasn't working.
then Greg and Lou called me.
I knew it was all their fault.
I could tell from the way they were behaving.
and they're blaming it all on you.
what? You're kidding.
saying it was all your idea
the robberies.
I told my whole division that you were mostly just along for the ride.
am I wrong?
N-No! No, you're right.
that's your cue. - They're the ones who came to me wanting to get prop guns.
said they'd figured out a way to make some money.
God. And I agreed to go along with it.
so stupid.
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.
you were desperate...
unemployed...
afraid.
they took advantage of you.
they did, didn't they?
making you case all the stores, forcing you to leave first during the robberies in case anyone was waiting outside.
don't say nothing till our lawyer gets here.
they talked me into doing nearly everything for them.
Oh, you're the prop master.
you should make all the fake I. D.S.
what's he doing? - He's talking.
hope he doesn't say anything about murder.
murder?
what murder?
I even had to sell most of the pot we stole myself.
Mr. Clark -- may I call you A. J?
A. J. I need the truth about what happened yesterday.
I...cased the place like usual...
and was, like, thrilled to see how little security they had.
I mean, do you know what Shea's Lounge is worth on the street?
I mean, they were practically giving it away.
so we thought, "Why not take it?
I'm not talking about the robberies.
I'm talking about the murder.
now, you weren't carrying a gun.
so was it Greg or Lou?
the guns were fake.
we didn't murder anyone! They were fake!
you invoked your right to counsel.
we can't talk to you about anything until your lawyer gets here.
then we disinvoke or -- or uninvoke! Yeah.
I hope it's not too late.
too late for what?!
this is a mistake! We didn't murder anybody!
those were prop guns! Those guns were fake!
that's not makeup...
and this...
is not movie magic.
if the guns were fake, how did someone get shot?
look, uh...
I...
I-I want a lawyer.
shut up!
chief, we got them to revoke.
but it's the same old lies.
why won't you guys believe us?!
when you rob 13 dispensaries at gunpoint and you murder someone, you kind of lose your credibility.
you want me to believe you? Tell me the truth. Now.
we didn't murder that guy.
we used fake guns. Okay?
we always use fake guns so it won't count as armed robbery.
you know that's not true, right?
uh, don't treat me like an idiot.
I worked on a law show for two years.
must not have been a very good one.
listen to me, you morons.
in California, it counts as armed robbery if people even think you have a gun.
luckily we're not charging you with robbery.
we are arresting you both for murder in the first degree.
look -- the second we saw that stock room was empty, we booked, okay?
the guy was alive when we left.
okay. Same old story.
you're both under arrest for murder. Let's go.
What?! - No!
you're making a huge mistake!
Aah, aah, easy!
you'll see those guns were fake!
we didn't do a thing!
once we search their places, - find that gun... - If we find the gun.
...we got them.
there's no way a jury won't convict.
you should be happy about this, Chief.
happy?
why should I be happy?
cause Delk is over the moon.
but he also told me you didn't stop by his office to discuss your promotion to Assistant Chief.
all right. You know what? I'm just gonna say it.
I don't like Will Pope.
he still has feelings for you.
that's ridiculous. That is absolutely not true.
Fritzi, please don't.
you are the only one who doesn't see it.
and you know what? Not only do I not like that you work with him,
I don't like it that you're spending more time worrying about what Pope wants than what I want.
well, that is absolutely not true.
no? - No.
when it comes to work, I spend most of my time wondering what I want, and you and Pope just don't enter into it.
and since you just told me something that you don't like, here's something I just hate.
and that is when my husband tells me who I should be working with.
no, wait a minute. This is not what I'm doing here.
that is exactly what you're doing!
and -- and you're telling me what job I should want...
when I'm happy where I am!
and the best way for me to hold on to my job is for Will to hold on to his.
well, that's not gonna happen.
I know you've always thought of yourselves as partners.
but let me tell you something -- Pope is out.
and you don't want to push him over the cliff, the extra money isn't worth it to you
that's fine.
but eventually you are gonna watch Pope moving all of his stuff out of his office, and Delk might replace him with someone you can't stand.
how would you feel if Taylor was sitting behind that desk instead of you?
huh? Have you ever thought about that?
moving all of his stuff out?
I...
do you really think Will still has feelings for me?
Yes.
well, I'll think about how to deal with that.
I promise.
may I borrow your glasses?
Yes.
uh, yeah, Detective Gabriel.
would you call, uh, Mr. Dodson, please?
let him know that...
we can unseal his crime scene in about two hours and give it back to him?
and I need a search warrant.
Thanks.
I believe this belongs to you.
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
you all right?
get down!
Hey! Stay down! Freeze!
get up! Aah!
put your hands behind your back!
you have the right to remain silent.
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.
you have the right to an attorney.
you can't do this! This is entrapment!
...one will be appointed to you by the state.
do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?
detective, could you...
I told you this was a bad idea!
Yes, I know you did.
thank you so much for reminding me.
I can't -- could y'all just figure out some way to get me down?
thank you so much. Mr. Dodson?
do you understand these rights?
y-you guys have this all wrong.
Shea hid our stuff up there.
no, Mr. Dodson, you put it up here, because you knew you were going to be robbed.
how would I have known that?
because you saw the robbers come in and case the store, just like Shea said would happen in the flier.
but you couldn't get your inventory out, because the security cameras were on all the time.
and how would you have explained that to Shea?
no, you told him you put it up here, to protect it.
lieutenant. - Here you go. Drop it.
then, when the robbers left emp-handed, you shot your partner and made a big score.
no, no. Shea shot himself.
twice? And then hid the gun in the attic?
I don't think so.
okay, what possible reason would I have to kill Shea?
maybe because he was talking people out of buying more than they needed...
and undercharging for Shea's Lounge.
maybe he cared more about the people who came here and less about sales.
chief... I hate to say this, but I don't think we're gonna be able to get high enough.
lieutenants Flynn and Provenza, would y'all please charge Mr. Dodson for murder in the first degree, with the special circumstance of financial gain?
a-and let Chief Pope know that I'll be up to see him just as soon as I get down.
will do.
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.
chief...
you're gonna have to jump. Yeah.
Really?
we'll catch ya.
we're gonna -- you jump on 3.
all right? So you're gonna go 1, 2...
then you're gonna jump.
all right? Here we go.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
chief.
I heard the good news.
very impressed with all of your work.
love turning the case over to the D. A.
with a bow on it.
uh, if I may, Chief, that's two bows.
major Crimes also collected their three armed robbers.
thank you, Commander. I stand corrected.
great work on both cases.
and you're never gonna believe this.
the killer turned out to be a guy...
who sold drugs.
is that so?
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. A-and get this.
the murderer said he did it because his partner wasn't commercial enough.
I know.
I know, it's shocking to find drug dealers shooting each other over money.
next thing you know, husbands will be killing their wives for being unfaithful.
what a world.
okay.
don't let me hold up your work.
will you excuse me?
chief Johnson.
what are you doing here?
I-I wasn't completely honest with you yesterday.
about?
chief Delk.
he offered me your job.
I see.
I'm not going to take it, but I thought you should know that he's looking to replace you.
well
thanks -- thanks for the heads-up.
so...
now we know for sure.
I guess that's it, then.
you're not going to fight back?
Brenda, I think at this point, it's either jump or be pushed.
what do you want me to do?
don't jump. Not yet.
Why?
I need you.
I need you holding the line on this reorganization.
I don't know how we'll manage without you.
okay.
I'll stay.
I'll...
I'll see it through to the bitter end.
well, thank you. I appreciate that. I do.
and do you realize that's what it's likely to be?
a bitter end.
well, we'll see, won't we?
don't grieve, Admiral.
it is logical.
the needs of the many outweigh......the needs of the few or the one.
I have been and always shall be your friend.
live long and prosper.
we are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honoured dead.
this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world.
a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect.
he did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one.
of my friend, I can only say this:
of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most......human.
honours. Hup!
space, the final frontier.
these are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
her ongoing mission to explore strange new worlds.
to seek out new lifeforms and new civilisations.
to boldly go......where no man has gone before.
USS Enterprise, Captain's Personal Log.
with most of our battle damage repaired, we're almost home.
yet I feel uneasy. And I wonder why.
perhaps it is the emptiness of this vessel.
most of our trainee crew has been reassigned.
lieutenant Saavik and my son David are exploring the Genesis planet, which he helped create.
and Enterprise feels like a house with all the children gone.
no, more empty even than that.
the death of Spock is like an open wound.
it seems that I've left the noblest part of myself back there......on that newborn planet.
status, Mr Sulu. - On course, Admiral.
estimating space dock in 2. 1 hours.
very well. Mr Chekov, I'll need a pre-approach scan.
take the science station, please. - Yes, sir.
Uhura... Any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis enquiries?
no, sir, there is no response. - That's very odd.
Scotty, progress report. - It's almost done, sir.
you'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
excellent timing. You fixed the barn door after the horse has come home.
how much refit time till we can take her out again?
eight weeks, sir. But you don't have eight weeks, so I'll do it in two.
have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
your reputation is secure, Scotty.
mr Sulu, take the Con. I'll be in my quarters.
sir?
are they planning a ceremony when we get in?
I mean, a reception? - Would you like a hero's welcome?
well, God knows there should be.
this time we've paid for the party with our dearest blood.
steady. Steady, boys.
keep scanning.
I thought you people were reliable. Where the hell is he?
he's been here for some time. Put me on hailing frequency.
commander Kruge... This is Valkris.
I have purchased the Genesis data. Ready to transmit.
well done, Valkris.
what the hell is...
disengage cloaking device!
transmit data. Now!
transmission completed.
you will find it useful.
I have, my Lord.
unfortunate.
understood.
thrusters.
what the hell's going on? When do I get paid off?
soon, Captain. Quite soon.
success, my Lord... and my love.
you will be remembered with honour.
fire!
new course. Federation neutral zone.
feed him!
Yes, my Lord.
approach Control, this is Enterprise, ready for docking manoeuvre.
enterprise is cleared to dock. - Lock on.
systems locked.
enjoy the ride, and welcome home. - Enterprise confirms.
acknowledge, doors closed.
would you look at that!
my friends, the great experiment.
the Excelsior. Ready for trial runs.
she's supposed to have transwarp drive.
and if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a wagon.
young minds, fresh ideas. Be tolerant, Mr Scott.
standby umbilical and gravitational support systems.
aye, sir, moorings activated, all systems standing by.
Admiral. This is not possible. - Mr Chekov.
an energy reading from 'C' deck, from inside Mr Spock's quarters.
I ordered Spock's quarters sealed. - I sealed the room myself!
nevertheless, I am reading a lifeform there.
this entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour regarding Spock.
sir, Security reports the door to Spock's quarters has been forced.
I'm on my way. Sulu, continue docking procedures.
Jim...
help me.
you left me on Genesis. Why did you do that?
help me.
bones!
what the hell are you doing?
have you lost your mind?
help me, Jim. Take me home.
bones, we are. We are home.
then perhaps it's not too late.
climb the steps, Jim.
climb the steps of Mount Seleya.
mount Seleya?
bones, Mount Seleya's on Vulcan. We're home... on Earth.
remember.
Admiral, docking is completed.
Starfleet Commander Morrow is on his way for inspection.
Uhura, get the medics down here! Get them now!
you've all done remarkable service under the most difficult conditions.
you'll be receiving Starfleet's highest commendation.
and more importantly... extended shore leave.
all but you, Mr Scott. They need your wisdom on the new Excelsior.
report there tomorrow as Captain of Engineering.
with all appreciation, I'd prefer to supervise the refit of Enterprise.
I'm afraid that won't be necessary.
but, sir...
I'm sorry, Mr Scott, but there will be no refit.
Admiral... I don't understand. The Enterprise is not...
Jim, the Enterprise is 20 years old. We feel her day is over.
but we had requested...
we had hoped to take her back to Genesis.
that is out of the question. - May I ask why?
in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy.
until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis.
consider it a quarantine planet... and a forbidden subject.
to understand the events on which I report, it is necessary to review the theoretical data on the Genesis device, as developed by Doctors Carol and David Marcus.
genesis, simply put, is life from lifelessness.
the device was to be introduced into a pre-selected area of a lifeless space body, a moon or other dead form.
instead of a dead moon, a living, breathing planet now exists, capable of sustaining whatever life forms we see fit to deposit on it.
so?
speak.
great power to control, dominate.
speak. - Impressive.
they can make a planet.
Oh, yes. New cities, homes in the country.
your woman at your side, children playing at your feet.
and overhead, fluttering in the breeze, the flag of the Federation!
charming.
station. - Yes, my Lord.
share this with no one. - Understood, my Lord.
we are going to this planet.
even as our emissaries negotiate for peace with the Federation, we will act for the preservation of our race.
we will seize the secret of this weapon.
the secret of ultimate power!
success, my Lord.
we have reached the destination planet at point 035.
very well, Lieutenant. Helm.
execute standard orbital approach.
send a coded message for Starfleet Commander, Priority One.
federation science vessel Grissom arriving Genesis, Mutara Sector, to begin research. J. T. Esteban commanding.
dr Marcus, it's your planet.
begin scanning, please.
this is where the fun begins, Saavik.
just like your father, so human.
all units functional. Recorders are on. Scanning Sector 1.
the foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature 22. 2 Celsius.
sector 2 indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation. Temperature 39. 4.
sector 3, sub-tropical vegetation.
temperature decreasing rapidly.
it's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
fascinating.
all the varieties of land and weather known to Earth, within hours' walk.
metallic mass. - Close range scan.
a photon tube.
gravitational fields were in flux. It must have soft landed.
in code to Starfleet:
captain Spock's tube located on Genesis surface.
I don't believe it.
what is it?
if equipment is functioning properly, indications are an animal lifeform.
you said there wouldn't be any. - There shouldn't be.
cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable lifeform reading.
you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
we don't know what we're talking about here.
why don't we beam it up? - Oh, no.
regulations state, "Nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination is eliminated.
captain, beaming down to the surface is permitted.
if the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably safe.
please, we must see what it is. - Or who.
absent friends.
Admiral, what's going to happen to the Enterprise?
she's to be decommissioned. - Will we get another ship?
I can't get an answer. Starfleet's up to its brass in galactic conference.
no one has time for those who stand and wait.
sir, about Dr McCoy, how is he?
he's home, resting comfortably, pumped full of tranquilizers.
they say it's exhaustion. He promised he'd stay put. We'll see.
Ah, Mr Scott.
come.
Sarek!
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
please excuse us.
ambassador, I would have come to Vulcan to express my deep sympathy.
spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government.
I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Spock trusted you. And you denied him his future.
I saw no future. - Only his body was in death, Kirk.
and you were the last one to be with him.
then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
but why? - Because he asked you to!
he entrusted you......with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body!
he asked you to bring him to us.
and to bring that which he gave you: His Katra. His living spirit.
sir...
your son meant more to me than you can know.
I'd have given my life if it would have saved his.
believe me when I tell you... he made no request of me.
he would not have spoken of it openly.
then how was...
I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
certainly.
he spoke of your friendship.
Yes.
he... asked you not to grieve.
Yes.
the needs of the many......outweigh......the needs of the few...or the one.
Spock...I have been......and always shall be your friend.
no.
forgive me.
it is not here.
I had assumed he mind-melded with you.
it is the Vulcan way... when the body's end is near.
we were separated.
he couldn't touch me.
then everything that he was......everything he knew......is lost.
please wait.
he would have found a way. If there was that much at stake, Spock would have found a way.
Yes. But how?
what if he joined with someone else?
engine Room, Flight Recorder Visual. Star date 8128. 78.
go.

Yes.

No! You'll flood the whole compartment!
he'll die. - Captain! He's dead already.
back, 0. 76.
flight Recorder Visual, 28. 76.
what is Mr Scott's condition? - I don't think that he...
sorry, Doctor, I have no time to discuss this logically.
freeze.
repeat... and augment.
remember...
McCoy!
what must I do?
you must bring them to Mount Seleya on Vulcan.
only there can both find peace.
what you ask......is difficult.
you will find a way, Kirk.
if you honour them both, you must.
I will.
transporter Room, stand by to energise.
aye, sir, energising now.
Grissom to Saavik. We're picking up radiation from the lifeform.
affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
exercise caution, Lieutenant.
this landing is Captain's discretion, and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'll try to remember that.
there are your lifeforms. These were microbes on the tube's surface.
we shot them here from Enterprise. They were fruitful and multiplied.
but how could they have evolved so quickly?
Saavik...
what is it?
Spock's burial robe.
but I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules.
don't quote rules to me. I'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice.
one man who's died for us, another with deep emotional problems.
this business about Spock and McCoy...
honestly, I never understood Vulcan mysticism.
you don't have to believe. I'm not even sure that I believe.
but if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul......then it's my responsibility. - Yours?
as surely as if it were my very own.
give me back the Enterprise. With Scotty's help I could...
the Enterprise would never stand the pounding, and you know it!
then I'll hire a ship. - Out of the question, my friend.
the Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis.
your life and your career stand for rationality, not intellectual chaos.
you'll destroy yourself. Do you understand me, Jim?
I hear you.
I had to try.
of course.
thanks for the drink. - Any time.
the word, sir? - The word......is no. I am therefore going anyway.
you can count on our help, sir. - Shall I alert Dr McCoy?
please. He has a long journey ahead of him.
long time, Doc.
Yeah. Anybody been looking for me?
I have, but what's the use? What'll it be?
to expect one to order poison in a bar is not logical.
got it.
to your planet, welcome.
I think that's my line, stranger. - Oh, forgive.
I here am new. But you are known, being McCoy from Enterprise.
you have me at a disadvantage, sir. - I name not important.
you seek I. Message received.
available ship stands by.
how much and how soon?
how soon is now. How much is where.
somewhere in the Mutara Sector. - Oh, Mutara restricted!
take permits many. Money more.
there aren't going to be any damn permits!
how can you get a permit to do a damn illegal thing?
look... Price you name, money I got!
place you name, money I name, otherwise bargain, no.
all right, dammit! Genesis. The name of the place we're going is Genesis!
Genesis?!
Yes, Genesis! How can you be deaf with ears like that?
genesis allowed is not! It's planet forbidden!
look, my backward friend. Genesis may be planet forbidden, but I'm...
sir, I'm sorry. You don't want to be discussing this subject in public.
I'll discuss what I like! And who in the hell are you?!
would you like a ride home, Dr McCoy?
if I wanted a ride home, would I be trying to charter a space flight?
how in the hell do you know who I am?
federation Security, sir.
you're gonna get a nice long rest, Doctor.
Saavik to Grissom. We are definitely reading a second lifeform.
we concur. Proceed with caution, Saavik.
what the hell is going on down there?
be quick, Admiral. They're moving him to the Federation 'Funny Farm'.
Yes, poor friend. I hear he's fruity as a nutcake.
two minutes.
Jim!
how many fingers do I have up? - That's not very damn funny.
your sense of humour has returned. - The hell it has. What's that?
you're suffering from a Vulcan mind-meld, Doctor.
that green-blooded son-of-a-bitch.
it's his revenge for all those arguments he lost.
let me see your hand. This will make you well enough to travel.
Where's Admiral Kirk? - With the prisoner.
get him quickly. Commander, Starfleet, wants him right away.
don't get smart, Tiny.
Admiral, Starfleet... - This man's sick. Look.
side elevator. Agents on their way up.
don't call me Tiny.
unit Two, this is unit One.
the Koyabashi Maru has set sail for the promised land.
message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
you're taking me to the promised land?
what are friends for?
mr Scott... Calling it a night?
looking forward to breaking some of Enterprise's speed records tomorrow.
good night.
level, please. - Transporter Room.
thank you. - Up your shaft!
Roger, Old City Station at 22. 00 hours. All is well.
understood. All stations clear.
a 20-year space veteran, you choose the worst duty station in town.
I mean, look at this place! This is the hind end of space.
peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
maybe that's okay for someone like you, whose career is winding down.
but me, I need some challenge in my life, adventure.
maybe even just a surprise or two.
well, you know what they say. Be careful what you wish for.
you may get it.
good evening, Commander. Is everything ready?
step into my parlour, gentlemen.
that's Admiral Kirk, my God. - Very good for you, Lieutenant.
but it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded IDs.
I'm not going to do anything, but you're going to sit in the closet.
have you lost all your sense of reality?
this isn't reality.
this is fantasy. You wanted adventure, how's this?
the old adrenalin going, huh? Good boy.
go on. Go on! - I'll just get in the closet.
okay!
I'm glad you're on our side. - Can you handle that?
I'll have Mr Adventure eating out of my hand, sir.
and I'll see all of you at the rendezvous. And Admiral...
all my hopes.
as promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready.
thank you, Mr Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.
my friends, I can't ask you to go any further.
dr McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Admiral, we're losing precious time.
what course, please, Admiral? - Mr Scott?
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
gentlemen... May the wind be at our backs. Stations, please.
clear all moorings. - Cleared, sir.
one quarter impulse power. - One quarter impulse.
commander, Starfleet, on emergency channel.
no reply, Chekov. Steady as she goes, Sulu.

sir, someone is stealing the Enterprise.
I'm on my way.

standby tractor beam. - Tractor beam, on.
if he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's in for a shock.
excelsior closing to 4, 000 metres, sir.
we'll need everything you have. - Warp Drive standing by.
Kirk...
if you do this, you'll never sit in the Captain's chair again.
warp Speed. - Aye, sir. Warp Speed.
prepare for Warp Speed. Stand by Transwarp Drive.
transwarp at your command. - Full power available.
execute.
...power available.
full power available.
transwarp Drive, maximum velocity in five, four, three, two, one.
Scotty, as good as your word.
the more they overtake the plumbing, the easier to stop up the drain.
here, Doctor, souvenirs from one surgeon to another.
I took them out of her main Transwarp computer drive.
nice of you to tell me in advance. - You missed the staff meeting.
your work today has been outstanding.
I will recommend you all for promotion......in whatever fleet we end up serving. Best speed to Genesis.
I am Saavik. Can you speak?
the Genesis Wave. His cells could have been regenerated.
captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead. - We have found the life sign.
it is a Vulcan child, perhaps eight to ten Earth years of age.
a child?! How did he get there? - It is Dr Marcus' opinion that......that the Genesis effect has in some way regenerated... Captain Spock.
Saavik, that's... extraordinary. What would you like to do next?
request permission to beam aboard immediately.
does Dr Marcus think there's any chance of radioactive contamination?
no. - None that he can detect, sir.
I'm going to advise Starfleet and get instructions.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve. - But let's do it by the book.
standby on this channel. Go.
Starfleet Command, this is USS Grissom on coded channel 98. 8.
sir, something is jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Locate!
sir, it's from astern!
Oh, my God.
Gunner... Target engine only.
captain, what is happening? - We're under attack!
stand by for evasive.
fire.
I wanted prisoners!
a lucky shot, sir...
sir, may I suggest... - Say the wrong thing, Torg!
there are life signs on the planet. Perhaps the very scientists you seek.
Saavik calling Grissom... - Very good.
Grissom, this is Saavik on emergency frequency. Come in, please.
what happened to them?
it would seem the Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
we must go. They will soon come after us.
estimating Genesis, 2. 9 hours present speed.
can we hold speed, Scotty? - Aye, she's got her second wind now.
scan for vessels in pursuit. - Scanning. Indications negative.
did I get it right?
great, Bones, just great.
it's time for total truth between us.
this planet is not what you intended or hoped for, is it?
not exactly.
Why?
I used proto-matter in the Genesis matrix.
an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
it was the only way to solve certain problems.
so, like your father, you changed the rules.
if I hadn't, it might have been years, or never!
how many have paid the price for your impatience?
how many have died? How much damage have you done?
and what is yet to come?
bridge, nothing happening here.
this planet is ageing in surges. - And Spock with it.
it seems they're joined together. - They are.
how long?
days. Maybe hours.
I'm sorry.
it will be hardest on Spock.
I don't understand. - Pon Farr.
Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
whoever they are, they're getting closer.
I'll go. - No.
I'll do it. Give me your phaser.
sir, Starfleet calling USS Grissom. A warning about us.
response? - Nothing. As before.
what's the Grissom up to? Will she join us or fire on us?
Chekov, break silence. Send Captain Esteban my compliments.
how are we doing? - How are we doing?
funny you should put it quite that way, Jim.
we are doing fine. But I'd feel safer giving him one of my kidneys than what's scrambled in my brain.
no response from Grissom on any channel.
keep trying. At regular intervals.
so it has come.
PON Farr.
will you trust me?
we are secured from Warp Speed. Now entering Genesis Sector.
proceed at impulse power.
vessel entering sector. - Yes.
not yet.
engage cloaking device.
I'd swear there was something there, sir.
what did you see?
for an instant, a scout class vessel.
could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency.
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Do you read?
I've come a long way for the power of Genesis.
and what do I find?
a weakling human, a Vulcan boy and a woman.
my Lord, we are survivors of a doomed expedition.
this planet will destroy itself soon. The Genesis experiment is a failure.
a failure?
the most powerful destructive force ever created.
you will tell me the secret of the Genesis torpedo.
I have no knowledge.
then I hope pain is something you enjoy.
I ordered no interruptions. - But, sir...
federation Starship approaching. - Bring me up.
Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Please come in.
battle Alert!
Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik.
report status. - We are cloaked.

no shields?
if my guess is right, they'll have to de-cloak before they can fire.
may all your guesses be right.
good shooting, Mr Scott.
precautionary, Mr Chekov, shields up.
sir, the shield's non-responsive. - Scotty?
the automation system's overloaded. I didn't expect combat, you know.
emergency power. Prepare to return fire.
I've got no control over anything. - Mr Sulu?
nothing, sir.
so... we're a sitting duck.
ready to fire emergency tube.
my Lord. The enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
put them on screen.
this is Admiral James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise.
...between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, ...your presence here is an act of war.
you have two minutes to surrender your crew and your vessel......or we will destroy you. - He's hiding something.
we may have dealt him a more serious blow than I thought.
how can you tell that? - I trust my instincts.
Admiral Kirk, this is your opponent speaking.
don't lecture me about treaty violations!
in creating an ultimate weapon, the Federation has become criminals!
it is not I who will surrender, it is you!
from the team who developed your doomsday weapon.
if you don't surrender, I'll execute them as enemies of galactic peace!
who is this? How dare you take prisoners?
who I am is not important. That I have them is.
you may speak to them.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik. - Saavik!
is David with you? - Yes, and someone else.
a Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
this... Vulcan...
is he alive?
he is not himself, but he lives.
he's subject to rapid ageing, like this unstable planet.
Hello, sir, it's David.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I should've known you'd come. It's true, this planet is unstable.
it's gonna destroy itself within hours.
David, what went wrong?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender.
genesis doesn't work. I can't believe they'd kill us for it.
Admiral, your friend is mistaken, I meant what I said.
wait! Give me a chance to talk...
kill one of them. I don't care which.
Saavik?
David?
you Klingon bastard, you've killed my son.
Klingon bastard, you've killed my son!
you Klingon bastard!
there are two more prisoners, Admiral.
do you want them killed, too?
surrender your vessel.
all right.
I give two minutes to you and your gallant crew.
take every last man, form a boarding party, armed heavily!
they outnumber us, my Lord. - We are Klingons!
once you control the ship we will transfer our flag there
about a dozen officers and men.
with some of them on the planet.
I swear to you, we're not finished yet.
we have a job to do.
commander Klingon vessel. Prepare to board this ship on my next signal.
no tricks, Kirk! You have one minute.
no tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you.
to the Transport Room. Success!

my Lord, the ship appears to be deserted.
how can that be? They're hiding.
it's the only thing speaking. - Speaking? Let me hear.
nine, eight, seven, six...
...five... - Get out! Get out of there!
get out! ...one...
my God, Bones. What have I done?
what you had to do. What you always do.
turn death into a fighting chance to live.
planet core readings, unstable. Changing rapidly.
what about surface life signs?
there.
bones.
what happened? - He gave his life to save us.
what about his mind? - His mind's a void.
is there anything we can do? - Only one thing.
get him off this planet. His ageing is part of what's going on around us.
Klingon Commander, this is Admiral James T. Kirk.
I'm alive and well on the planet's surface.
I know this will come as a pleasant surprise to you.
our ship was a victim of an unfortunate accident.
sorry about your crew, but as we say on Earth, "C'est la vie."
I have what you want.
I have the secret of Genesis.
do you hear me?
I'm waiting for you!
what is your answer?
drop all weapons!
Maltz... Prisoners at beam coordinates.
you should take the Vulcan too. - No!
but why? - Because you wish it.
Maltz... Activate beam!
genesis. I want it!
beam the Vulcan up, and we'll talk.
give me what I want and I'll consider it.
fool! Look around you! The planet's destroying itself!
if we don't help each other, we'll die here!
give me Genesis!
give me your hand! - Kirk!
I... have had......enough of you!
don't! How many more?
just him, sir.
bones, help Spock.
we've got to break out of orbit.
you, help us or die.
fine, I'll kill you later. Let's get out of here.
No! This!
that or nothing.
if I read this right, sir, we have full power.
go, Sulu.
goodbye, David.
we are clear and free to navigate.
best speed to Vulcan. Mr Chekov, take the prisoner below.
Spock...
for God's sake, talk to me!
you stuck this damn thing in my head, remember?
remember?
now, tell me what to do with it.
help me.
I'm gonna tell you something that I......never thought I'd hear myself say.
but it seems I've missed you.
I don't know if I could stand to lose you again.
ambassador, they are on approach.
they're requesting permission to land.
tell Kirk we'll be ready.
mr Sulu, you're on manual.
it's been a while, sir. Here we go.
Retrothrusters.
Sarek is waiting above, sir.
Sarek...
child of Skon, child of Solkar...
the body of your son breathes still.
what is your wish?
I ask for Fal-Tor-Pan. The refusion.
what you seek has not been done since ages past, and then only in legend.
your request is not logical.
forgive me, T'Lar.
my logic is uncertain where my son is concerned.
who is the keeper of the Katra?
I am.
McCoy, Leonard H. son of David.
McCoy, Son of David...
since thou art human, we cannot expect thee to understand fully what Sarek has requested.
Spock's body lives.
with your approval, we shall use all our powers
but McCoy, you must now be warned.
the danger to thyself is as grave as the danger to Spock.
you must make the choice.
hell of a time to ask.
I'm all right, Jim.
what about Spock?
only time will answer.
Kirk... I thank you. What you have done is...
what I have done...
...I had to do.
but at what cost?
your ship. Your son.
if I hadn't tried... the cost would have been my soul.
my father says that you have been my friend.
you came back for me.
you would have done the same for me.
why would you do this?
because the needs of the many.....outweigh the needs of the one.
I have been...
Yes.
Yes, Spock!
the ship. Out of danger?
you saved the ship.
you saved us all. Don't you remember?
Jim.
your name is Jim.
Yes.
this is Dorris archer, she's the third woman to go missing in Boise, Idaho, this year,
along with Paula Renmar and Samantha Rush.
they went missing roughly 2 months apart.
well, hello.
what, did you join a boy band?
no.
OK, so what are we looking at here?
late 20s, early 30s.
all single, though two are in committed relationships.
all living on their own.
looks like normal suburban houses. Gives the unsub privacy.
the differences are more striking than the similarities.
different hair colors, different body shapes.
what do you know about his M. O?
that's why we were invited in.
the abduction sites are pristine.
and there's no DNA besides the victims',
and there's no sign of forced entry or a struggle.
and the victims aren't reported missing until 2 or 3 days after they're abducted.
2 or 3 days
women like this don't just vanish
without somebody noticing.
Yes. Which is why I asked Garcia
to dig into their lives.
and when I took a look at their online activity,
I could easily see how the unsub is doing it.
social networking sites.
Yeah. Facebook, Twitter.
you name an online life-sharing time suck,
the victims were on it.
and if you look at each of their last posts,
they say kind of the same thing
going out of town, going on a business trip,
going on a vacation.
but when you look at the time and date stamp
of each of these, cue the "Twilight zone" Music,
because they were all posted the morning after each of them went missing.
the unsub posted them.
social networks are an easy way
for an unsub to target his victims.
these women were especially open.
they posted everything from what they were having for dinner
to where they were going on dates.
so this unsub friends his victims
and then uses that as a cover once he takes them.
that means he can hack into their accounts.
so he's excellent with computers.
definitely profiles as patient and organized.
he's obsessive enough to remove all forensic details,
but also patient enough to wait 2 months before abductions.
he can afford to be.
he gets 3 days to do whatever he wants to these women.
that means we need to assume these women are already dead.
the question is what he does while he has them.
the single biggest problem with communication
is the illusion that it has taken place.
george Bernard Shaw.
so if this unsub is using social networks
to find his victims, can't we use that to find him?
Yeah, if these women each had 100 friends. Following them, then the unsub would pop up on each of their lists, right?
uh, the Detective in charge, John Fordham,
he looked into their groups. Everyone checked out.
social networking sites are surprisingly insecure.
facebook recently tried to update
all their privacy settings, and in doing so,
they made everybody's profiles viewable.
can somebody explain to me the appeal of these sites?
eating Sushi tonight. Yum.
boss is keeping me late at work. Grr.
whose life is so important
that we'd be interested in this kind of detail?
I don't know. I guess that's the running joke, right?
I mean, nobody is. But we'd all like to believe
there's actually an audience out there
that wants to follow our every move.
you know, some sites actually have a GPS feature built in.
you can tell exactly where someone is
every time they post a new comment.
this is telling us how he's finding them,
but it's not telling us how he's getting into their houses.
at the very least, I believe that he has copies of their keys.
Dorris archer had a home security system installed,
but the disable code was entered at 1: 56 A. M.
so he knew that, too.
he also found a way to deal with her dog.
a German Shepherd she adopted from the pound last year
went missing the night that she did.
all right, so this guy's gotta be in and out of the house well before the night of the disappearance.
he comes up with some ruse, talks his way inside,
then once he's familiar enough with the house,
he knows he can come back and kidnap them -Without disturbing anything. -What about the people who come into your house that you don't consider a threat?
home repair guys, dog-walkers.
Yeah, Detective Fordham looked into that, too.
no one even came close to being a killer.
OK, Morgan and Prentiss, start with the last abduction sites.
see if anything point to his M.O.
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ go back over the women's lives.
start with their friends on the social networking sites.
if this is how the unsub is finding them,
maybe they're connected to him without even realizing it.
uh, Detective Fordham.
agent Jareau?
Yeah. Uh, these are SSA Hotcher, Rossi, -And Dr. Spencer Reid. -How do you do?
well, thank you for coming. We can really use your help.
did you find anyone willing to talk to us about the victims?
the problem wasn't who to bring in.
it was who not to.
the man we're looking for
might have found your daughter through her social networks.
did Paula mention anyone new in her life?
no.
no one who started following her as a friend,
someone she didn't recognize?
I don't really know how those work.
someone sent me an email
congratulating me on Paula's promotion.
I didn't even know.
and when I asked her, she said, "Mom, I put that on my wall last week."
she was gone 2 days later.
Samantha was rigorous about keeping her status updated.
she's obsessed with those sites.
so I'm assuming she knew who followed her, then?
Oh, God, no.
she had over 1, 000 friends.
Wow. Why so many?
we both worked in real estate.
she saw it as the perfect way to promote herself.
so, wait. Even though she told all those people what she was doing, she didn't know who was following her?
you ever have so much email,
you feeling like you're drowning in it?
actually, I don't have email.
Seriously?
then let me break it down for you.
these websites are like email on crack.
it's impossible to keep up with everybody.
we just have a few more questions
about your girlfriend's disappearance.
did Dorris ever mention letting someone in her home?
like who?
well, we're just trying to figure out
who would know the code to her home security.
it must have been someone she trusted with the combination.
no. She was smart.
she took precautions.
that's the whole reason she got Bruno.
Bruno--the dog. So he was a guard dog?
Yeah. She trained him for like 6 weeks.
OK.
um...I know these are hard to look at,
but do you see anything different?
something he may have done to get himself inside.
this isn't right.
what's that?
the photographs. This is when we first started dating.
the one on the right should be on the left.
OK. And she wouldn't have rearranged them herself?
no. She arranged them a certain way to tell a story.
it was--it was how we fell in love.
OK, JJ, I got it.
you see it?
actually, yeah.
looks like he did try to hang something on the wall.
there's even a little residue left over.
let me call you back. -Yeah.
Yeah, what do you got?
Hey, I got one up here, too.
what would he try to hang on that part of the wall?
well, from here,
I have an unobstructed view
of the second floor and down the stairs.
it's the same thing down here.
you can see the entire entrance.
cameras.
he put up cameras.
we think this is what he's using to spy on his victims.
they're small, they're cheap, and they're easily hidden,
behind photos, books, or plants.
the footage they record can then
be transmitted anywhere. Website of your choice,
even your cell phone.
and he can toggle between cameras
to see everything that's happening in the house.
and you found 5 of these at different points in the house?
upstairs, downstairs, bedroom, even the bath.
a ruse gets him in the door,
but it doesn't buy him enough time to put up 5 of these.
right. That's why we think he starts with one camera
facing the front door.
that tells him when it's safe to enter the house,
when she comes and goes, when the dog-walker comes,
and what the combination to the house is.
it fits his M.O.
it he learned their every detail on social networks,
he will be just as obsessive in his surveillance.
and once he learns their routine, all he has to do
is pick the lock, put up the rest of the cameras, and boom, he got their whole life at his fingertips.
what does he do with the video? Maybe he keeps them?
if he's a voyeur, yes.
Ah, voyeurs are rarely violent.
their excitement comes from spying without the object
knowing they're being watched.
and by abducting his victims,
he's removing the outlet of his sexual release.
Reid is right.
so he must have some other agenda with these cameras.
he might be sharing the footage with other people.
we need to have Garcia dig into surveillance
in illegal video websites.
I'm going to take this with us. -Why?
we originally profiled there wasn't any facial similarity between the victims, but I'm not so sure that's true.
I want to compare Dorris' picture with the other victims.
these videos the unsub took, it looks like
one of them he posted online, which may help me nab it.
if he puts it on the Web,
can't you track that back directly to his computer?
normally, yes. Normally, in like in 17 seconds
I can get you the network he's using,
get a physical address of his modem,
and presto change-o, no more bad guy,
but this unsub is a creepy computer aficionado.
do you guys know what a proxy server is?
it's an Internet relay.
precisely. Kids use them to get around blocked sites.
now, usually one proxy is plenty,
but this piece of work is using dozens of proxy servers.
he's bounced his signal off of China, North Korea,
russia, South Africa...
Garcia, can you trace him back to Boise?
of course I can, and that's what I'm doing?
time is the unfortunate ingredient I need, though.
this just in.
looks like one of the proxy servers archived what he was streaming on the night of Dorris archer's disappearance.
can we see it? -Pulling it up now.
well, Prentiss and Morgan were right.
he knows the house.
and the dog knows him.
Oh, please don't hurt that doggie.
how many trips inside the house would that take?
a dozen?
see that? The camera's attached to him. It's his point of view.
so he can relive it over and over again.
OK, can someone tell me when this is over?
please. -Not yet.
he's tender to her.
she means more to him as a corpse than as a living person.
Garcia, we need to find the unsub's network.
even if it's a rough area, it'll help narrow the geographic profile.
Yeah. Sir, that's totally what I'm trying to figure out.
uh, there is something else kind of huge you need to know about.
do you see this line of code there?
Yeah, what about them?
it allows the user admin, and in this case, the unsub, to set up a chat room.
people were watching this on the night of the murder.
we thought he was posting these after the fact. He's not.
he wants people to experience it with him.
he wants an audience.
he has fans.
can you freeze that?
he's acknowledging the camera.
tip of the hat to his fans. He knows they're watching.
classic narcissistic behavior.
he's performing for his audience.
we know the M.O. The question is how.
what kind of job gives him access to the victims' houses?
it has to be network and I.T.S,
the guy you let in to hook up your Internet.
gets him in their house and on their computers.
I went through all the women's Internet service providers with a fine-tooth comb.
they all used different companies
and no overlap with sales reps.
what about onsite tech support?
Oh, well, clean as a whistle.
they all had alibis with no criminal records.
what I don't understand is,
why does he take the bodies with him after they're dead?
Yeah, it'd be one thing if he took them while they were still alive,
but he's accomplished his task.
he murders them and he completes the performance.
so why take the risk of carrying a corpse to your car?
well, there must be some postmortem behavior
or signature or something we're not seeing.
well, think about that for a second.
he's sharing this murder with a crowd of onlookers.
what could he be doing to these bodies just for himself?
Hey, guys.
Garcia's got something for us.
go ahead, baby girl.
OK, friends, I have some good news,
but first, here is the thing that sucks.
I located the network the unsub is using in Boise,
and it is the victims' own wireless.
so does he hack in before he starts with the murders?
hacking is obscenely time-consuming.
I just make it look easy because I'm a genius. But he's not me.
so my guess is that he's got to lurk around their network for at least a couple of days to a week before he kills them.
that's pretty brilliant on his part.
Yeah, he knows when we follow his online paper trail
that it'll lead us right back to the murder site.
what's the good news?
hackers are very loyal to their spoofing techniques,
and if they think no one's watching,
they'll use the same roads over and over.
OK, so if he goes through Russia, China, and north Korea again...
I have flagged those servers,
and if he uses them in the same order,
I will catch him so fast.
that's only going to help us if he commits another murder.
Yes, that's also true.
excuse me.
Garcia, if he does stream this again,
how much time will you need to find the network?
Oh, uh, that's hard to guess
with all the international pinging. I
ballpark. -Uh, 7 minutes?
that's not fast enough. He's in and out of the house in 5.
Oh, God. I'm going to have to trim my time down, then.
Garcia, get it done. JJ, we need to call a press conference.
now that we know how he's killing these women,
we need to get it out there.
uh, all right, I'll, uh, prescreen the journalists I call on,
hope we don't get anything out of left field.
good.
I know what connects the victims.
I was staring at pictures of the victims
and I knew there was a pattern connecting them,
but I couldn't tell what it was until I broke it down mathematically.
why are we so drawn to celebrity faces?
because there's a symmetry to their beauty
the eyes, the ears, the ratio of the forehead to the chin.
the more balanced they are,
the more appealing they are to our eye.
these women aren't celebrities, though.
no, but there are similarities between them,
and it wasn't until I scanned their pictures and got it to the guys at Quantico that I had a full breakdown.
all right, strip away eye color, hair color, and skin tone,
and what are we left with geometrically?
they're all slightly dystopic.
the left eye is slightly lower than the right eye on all the victims.
all the noses are narrow.
the forehead has the same Ridge.
he might not even be aware that he sees it in them.
there have been studies that suggest
that we pick our spouses subconsciously,
based on a facial symmetry that we recognize.
so consciously or unconsciously,
when he recognizes it, he has to destroy it.
which means he only has interest in the bodies
as they relate back to him.
maybe...
they're a reflection.
remember what he did at the end of the video?
he wiped the tear away.
another act of compassion he's not capable of.
his narcissism prevents him from that.
in the Greek myth, narcissus was so self-absorbed
that he fell in love with his own reflection in the water.
exactly. He finds women with the same face,
he strangles them, and then stares at them after they've died.
but whose image does he really see?
his own.
thank you.
most of us take the Internet for granted.
we forget about texts that we share
or updates we put on social networks.
but the Internet never forgets.
once it's out there, it's out there forever.
now, we all know about the horrific deaths that get shown on the Web.
the murder of a journalist. The stoning of an Iranian dissident.
those murders are immortal.
and this unsub craves that same immortality.
he recognizes his face on theirs
and he kills them as a way of saying, "This is what I look like."
we think this also informs his compulsion
to take the bodies with him.
he takes them to a secondary location
where we believe he preserves them,
so that every time he looks at them,
he sees his own ego reflected.
fortunately for us, this means we have a good idea
of what he looks like.
based on the shape of the victims' faces,
we have a rough composite sketch.
this unsub is an expert with computers and home networks.
so look into criminal records of men with extensive computer training.
we know you've already looked into the victims' computer I. T. Settings,
so we'd like to expand the search.
look into electronic stores,
computer distributors, I. T. Departments where the women worked.
we overuse the term narcissistic in our culture,
but we're going back to the psychological definition.
every aspect of this man's life
has been constructed around an inflated sense of self.
unsubs like this are particularly vulnerable
to what's called narcissistic injury.
if his self-worth is attacked or damaged, he will lash out.
so, if you find this unsub, do not challenge him publicly.
say you just want to talk him,
see if he knows anything about the brilliant mastermind who's stalking these women.
under no circumstances should you denigrate him.
as difficult as it is, we need to talk up his exploits
as if we respected him.
searching for wireless server dound kitgirl 29
this is a sketch of the man we're looking for.
he is a white male,
roughly 5'10."
he's highly skilled with computers and networks.
we encourage everyone to monitor the information they post about themselves on social networks.
do not document the details of your day.
don't post pictures of yourself, friends, or family.
all right, we'll take some questions. Yeah?
how did the FBI generate this sketch if there were no eyewitnesses?
it's an approximation based on a video we recovered.
OK, yeah, what's your question?
can you comment on the rumor he has some sort of facial symmetry with his victims?
does he look like them?
right now the Boise police are pursuing several theories.
that's not a no.
why would he target women who look like him?
it's too soon to speculate on how or why he chooses his victims.
well, what should people do to protect themselves, change their face?
no, just update your online security
and be vigilant about what you post.
all right, we're done with questions.
thank you. Thank you.
somebody leaked our profile.
the press started asking questions about facial symmetry.
it must have been one of your officers.
look, my guys were checking their cell phones,
but that's just habit now.
all right, I can talk to the press independently,
I can keep this off the 10: 00 news, but
I know. It went out live.
well, what are the chances he didn't see it?
not good.
Oh, your crafty little sicko.
sir, it's fantastic you called. I just figured out
how are you doing on pinning down the networks?
OK, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
remember how I said he was spoofing his signal off different servers?
well, it turns out some of those are a decoy meant to waste my time.
so does that mean you can find him faster?
totally. Totally. I can write a program
that filters out the decoys
Oh, crap.
is that him?
Yeah. Uh...
OK. It looks like I'm gonna have to filter this on the fly.
can you send us the feed?
I think I can intercept it in Ukraine.
he's going live.
look at the way he's moving.
he's not slow and deliberate. This guy's pissed.
all right, what do we see? Determining markers.
a one-story cottage.
it could be anywhere.
is there a number on the house?
no, and he's already at the door.
he's using twice as many proxy servers.
wait. This window here on the bottom- is that the chat room?
there she is. He's in the house, guys.
he's completely changed his M.O.
it is way too early. There's too much light.
what happened?
someone asked the wrong question at the press conference.
Oh, my God, turn around. Just turn around.
maybe she can fend him off.
new kitchen appliances. Can we track them through work orders?
he'll be gone by then.
Garcia, give us something.
I'm stateside now. I'm almost to Idaho.
I just need more time. -You're not gonna make it
Yes, I will. I will. I
forget the unsub. Can you run a trace on everybody in the chat room?
I can't do both, sir. Let me do this.
Garcia, tag the viewers. That's an order.
baby girl, it's gonna be OK.
no, no, it's not. It's bad enough
that there's been so much death around me,
but this guy is all up in my turf,
and he's really good at what he does for really awful reasons.
that's why you're gonna find the perverts
that watched it happen in that chat room,
and we'll nail them to the wall
and they're gonna give up the unsub.
no, no, that is not good enough.
I want to watch him suffer. I want to watch him bleed.
Oh, God, I just scared myself.
good. That's a good thing.
because if there's one thing I've learned the hard way
is the last person you want to tick off is miss Penelope Garcia.
Ohh...That's a compliment, right?
Yes, it is.
we will beat this guy. Believe that.
now, I'll call you when we've got something. -Ok.
her name was Allison Kittridge, 29.
this was her first house.
all right, so this unsub accelerated his timetable and his M.O.
he was moving faster because he was angry.
Yeah. The press conference told him something about himself he didn't like,
so he rushed. Which means he made a mistake.
now, what was it?
well, it wasn't the cameras.
he remembered to take those with him.
it wasn't the body. He took that with him, too.
Hey, did, uh, Garcia find anything unusual with Allison's wireless?
no. Records show that it was a basic DSL installation.
Hey, Prentiss.
Yeah. Help me move this table.
what do you got?
you see this line right here?
Yeah.
this is what brings the Internet from the street into the house.
OK. So? -This isn't DSL.
it's not?
it's a fiber-optic cable.
completely different type of connection.
we just found his mistake.
if there's already an Internet connection in the house,
why does he bring his own with him? Is it the upload speed?
fiber-optic allows him to stream large amounts of video.
and maintain a chat room.
that's dozens of computers connected to him at once.
he'd need a lot of bandwidth for something like that.
we checked all the ISPs. Why didn't he turn up?
I get mail, phone calls, people knock on my door all the time
to see if I want to upgrade my Internet.
Yeah, I get them, too.
and they'll offer to come inside and demonstrate
how much faster their connection is.
you think that's the ruse that gets him in the door?
it makes sense.
during his demonstration, he would have access
to his victims' computers.
on his way out, he asks for a glass of water,
a distraction, something to buy enough time to plant that first camera.
we need to find out what company owns this cable.
detective Fordham's already hunting that down,
and there's an I. D. Number on it, so it shouldn't take long.
we'll have JJ and Reid follow up.
I need you two to track down who was in the chat room.
Garcia finished her sweep?
Yeah. Most were international. 3 were local.
I bet one of them knows the unsub.
we have a warrant.
help you gentlemen?
Yeah, that's me.
we need talk to you about a video you watched last night.
I'm sorry. What video?
this is a warrant for all the computers in your possession.
you're under arrest for accessory to murder.
accessory?
watching a murder happen online and doing nothing about it Is a felony.
I don't know what you're talking about.
what murder?
Yes, this is our cable.
Mrs. Hightower, we went over your records,
and it turns out that none of the 4 victims
signed up with your service.
4? God, those poor women.
we think it's an employee using your cable as a ruse
to get into the house. Can you think of any
uh, he worked on one of our trucks
as we laid the fiber in with the regular phone line.
and you're certain that it's him?
we caught him hoarding it.
he said it was for a home project.
until we got angry phone calls that he was going door to door
offering free fiber-optic installation.
we fired him on the spot.
we need his information.
Absolutely.
ladies and gentlemen, meet Mac Jones.
that isn't the I. D. We got from the phone company.
that's because last year Mr. Jones had his identity stolen.
the unsub took his license and his credit card,
used them for 2 weeks, and then moved on.
now, I can't tell you who the unsub is pretending to be now,
but since a picture's worth a thousand databases,
I can tell you who he was.
robert Johnson, 3-time loser,
arrested for possession of torture videos.
spent some time in a halfway house before he disappeared.
I found a blog of his online. Here's a quote
next time you won't be able to stop me.
that's his narcissism again.
furious that he got caught and he remakes himself as a killer.
it allows him to free the impulses that were always there.
Garcia, is there a pattern to the identities that he steals?
no. He's really disciplined about it.
once he burns through an identity, he never uses the same one again.
you know how I describe some suspects as being off the grid?
this guy is totally the opposite.
he's all over the grid.
he's manipulating the grid.
and he never stays in one place for very long.
so how do we find out who he is now?
I don't think we're going to.
the man known as Robert Johnson is in the wind. If he's this flexible with his name, his real name, forget it.
but there's another way we can find him.
which is?
his online name,
his hacker handle.
that's the name that matters to him.
wait. Wouldn't he have hundreds of those, too?
most definitely. But remember how I said hackers are loyal?
they stick to certain names.
that's how you identify yourself to other hackers.
that's how the FBI caught me.
so if we find the handle...
I'll get you the unsub. I promise.
look, I wish I could help you find the guy
posting these videos, -But I never visited that website, man. -Right.
maybe somebody broke into my computer or something.
see, Scott, we think it was you.
and we found some pretty interesting movies in your hard drive to back up our theory.
white girls can't hump.
that's nice.
Schindler's fist.
see, this one right here, this is the one that got my attention.
the erotic awakenings of Sandy.
how old was the girl in that video? What was she, 12?
I...
I can explain
shut up!
this is what's weird to me.
most of your files were locked away,
but not the child porn.
we found it in like 5 minutes.
it wasn't password protected or anything.
how does someone who's supposed to be so smart with computers
do something so dumb?
can we cut a deal?
you tell me what I want to know and the maybe we'll talk deal.
before this guy accepts you into the club...
he gives you the illegal stuff.
kids. Torture.
he has to know that you're risking as much as he is.
mutually assured destruction.
you rat him out, he takes you with him.
Yes.
what's his name?
I don't know. We never met.
don't you try and play me, kid.
his online name.
watcher 89.
were there any other names?
not that I could find. I don't like
signing up for porn unless I know who's running it.
Mrs. Prentiss.
agent Prentiss.
there's something else you should know.
he sent out a message.
he said tonight would be the best one yet.
he's attacking tonight?
of course.
he knows you're watching him.
he has to put on an extra-good show.
what's interesting, Mr. Chapman,
the two other men we talked to,
they had a form of collateral on their hard drive.
I'm sorry. Collateral?
hard-core pornography.
illegal. Rough.
I would never look at something like that.
you have all my computers. You must have searched them.
Yes. And we found nothing.
so, can I go?
no.
you see, there's still that nagging question
as to why you were logged on to that chat room last night.
Look...Agent Rossi,
I'm at a loss here.
first of all, I'm all thumbs when it comes to computers.
or you're very good with them
and know how to cover your tracks.
second of all,
my grandkids were at the house last night for a sleepover.
they were in bed by 8: 30.
we were so exhausted, my wife and I were asleep by 9: 00.
please! Ask her. She'll say the same thing.
I don't think I even checked my email last night.
do you know this man?
Yes.
he came into my store a while back.
Why?
uh, he said he liked my website.
which my son designed for me, by the way.
we chatted about appliances,
he bought a few items and left.
did he have a name?
no idea. We talked for 5 minutes.
I'll be right back.
do you believe him?
I believe he doesn't fit the profile of the other voyeurs.
they're good with computers.
they have hacking experience.
Garcia checked out the website.
she said it's crude. You can't even order anything from it.
maybe he's right. Maybe the unsub manipulated him
for something else, used his network as part of his spoofing.
go ahead, Garcia.
watcher 89--I got him.
does he have his own network?
he doesn't need one.
he's got a whole city to leech off of.
he's doing this again tonight.
can you send me a list of networks
he's hacked recently? Those are the potential victims.
I got 20 hits.
all right. Filter out men and families.
he only kills single women. - 8 left.
Garcia, do you have any pictures?
coming your way.
her. She's the one.
Lucy masters. You sure?
she's the only one with facial symmetry that would appeal to him.
this is the FBI! We're coming in.
clear!
she's not here, but her car is.
Hey. It just went on by itself.
that's Lucy masters.
he's recording us.
welcome to the show
Garcia, the unsub is working off Lucy masters' network.
can you tell where the video's being transmitted to?
I can't tell. He's not logged in as watcher 89.
he's not using any of the regular proxy servers.
if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't know that this was him.
damn it!
he's encrypted his connection to the proxies.
there's nothing I can do to help you find him.
what do we see? -Metal walls.
it must be the secondary location where he takes the victims.
wait a minute. Garcia, can you magnify the wall behind her?
Yeah, I can do that.
is that frost on the wall?
it's a walk-in freezer.
and I know where he got it.
we didn't catch you by mistake, did we, Austin?
excuse me?
you said the unsub liked your website,
how it was designed.
but it was your work.
what you can repair, what you can restore for him.
you gave him a place to hide the bodies.
that's not true.
talk to my wife.
I'm home by 6: 00 every night
that's the first thing voyeurs learn.
how to cover their tracks.
how to stalk between the hours of 9: 00 to 5: 00.
that's why there was no porn on your computer.
you had something better.
this is a crime!
I would never do what you're describing.
and even if you don't believe me, my wife knows.
my kids, my grandkids.
I hate computers.
I don't even know how they work.
well, then let me give you your first lesson.
when something goes out on the Internet, it's out there forever.
now, you're going to jail.
that's a foregone conclusion.
but, unless you cooperate with me,
I will do everything I can to make sure
that the next time your grandkids Google you,
they will find out what kind of a monster grandpa really is.
now, I will ask you once
where is the freezer?
1823 Hudson. I got it. We're on our way.
Garcia, it's been 3 minutes since the signal went up live.
Lucy might not have that much time left.
I can buy you some. Now that I've got his physical address,
I got my business all up in his.
no, no, not today.
No!
No!
now, when your Internet goes down,
it ruins your whole day, doesn't it, psycho?
No!
get off her! - Let her go!
get your hands off!
No! Let her go!
No! No! -Lucy.
get the paramedics in here!
OK. Ok. It's over. It's OK.
go, go, go, go.
it's Dorris archer...
and Allison kittridge.
you killed these women for your fans,
but this is where you kept them for yourself, isn't it,
you sick son of a bitch.
what do you see when you look at them?
you'll never understand what I did.
but out there,
my followers...
they understand.
well, too bad there's no wireless in prison.
get him out of here!
the Internet is the first thing "That humanity has built that humanity doesn't understand,"
the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.
Eric Schmidt.
just for the record...
I didn't do this.
Adam wanted me to give you this.
it's a ring.
that's a beautiful stone.
I'll be back for that.
it's not in there, kid. Your ring?
I sold it. - Who bought it?
welcome to madacorp.
I think I made a mistake bringing jessi to you.
I think it's vital that she continue coming.
in fact, if jessi misses even one appointment,
I won't hesitate to call social services.
cause I like you. Don't you like me?
well, yeah.
let's count to 3 and both say what's on our minds at the same time.
I like you. - I have cancer.
what?
Zzyzx. That's the way in.
when we were down there...I saw things.
this was baylin'S. Can't get it open.
locks can play secrets.
the stronger the lock, the bigger the secret.
Adam baylin's secrets are locked inside this box.
the secrets of zzyzx are locked inside my head.
but what could be so important to make me lock them away and keep them a secret from myself?
I guess sometimes the only thing more elusive than secrets is the key to unlocking them.
in this case, the key was the ring that adam gave me:
the ring I no longer had.
I just don't understand what's so important that's locked inside kyle's head.
everything that zzyzx was able to feed him
that is, before you could fit their remains in an ashtray.
how did your trip with stephen trager go?
it went well.
he opened up about his dead father. I'd say we bonded.
and how are things with nicole since your...altercation?
we'll find out.
she has another session with jessi in a couple of days.
we need to speed things up.
drop the spoon and back away from the stove, nice and easy.
come on, I'm starving.
it's your fault this stuff smells so good.
I think there was a compliment in there somewhere.
pasta, most delicious of all carb delivery systems.
Yeah, it's an old family recipe.
how old?
Oh, about 53 minutes.
Oh, I need you to set an extra place at the table. Amanda is joining us.
did kyle invite her?
Yes, and he's very excited and whatever the kyle version of nervous is.
great. Kyle has a date.
Bye-bye, leftovers.
Josh, this is important to him.
Hey, josh, why don't you invite andy over for dinner?
what, no smart-ass reply?
what's next, locusts?
Hey, guys.
we have a guest for dinner. This is my boss, julian ballantine.
sorry to spring this on you.
I didn't get a chance to call.
Oh, no. Don't be silly.
it's so nice to finally meet you, mr. Ballantine.
Bye-bye, seconds.
this is josh and lori.
good to meet you, and please call me julian.
Nicole.
I brought, uh, red and white.
didn't know what you'd be serving.
Oh, I like red.
I mean-- I mean, I will when I'm 21.
I heard the door. Is amanda
Oh, you must be kyle.
I heard so much about you from stephen.
we work together at madacorp.
excuse me.
you have to forgive kyle.
tonight's kind of a date.
Hi.
you look beautiful.
I didn't know what to wear.
I wasn't sure how fancy it would be or not, - so I- - you wear what you were wearing the first time I saw you, when you were playing the piano.
I had no idea I
wait, how could you even remember that?
how could I forget it?
well, I almost forgot.
there's this concert at seattle phil.
they're playing all pachelbel's works, and- - I'd love to.
go with you, I mean.
you know, I almost brought champagne, but I figured we'd save that till after the test this week.
what test?
it's a systems integration test.
we bring all the software and hardware online together at the same time.
we synch it all up to the mainframe and evaluate the biometric signature compatibility.
so you're turning neural impulses into computer data.
Yeah.
sounds like you understand this stuff better than I do.
you know, maybe I should have served dinner with a manual.
I don't know what I did before we had stephen around, but after this week,
I promise I won't keep him away from you any more than absolutely necessary.
I figured emily can handle the next trip solo.
Oh, emily went with you last weekend?
Yeah. She's part of the project.
I'd like to propose a toast, if I may.
to stephen and your wonderful family, whom I hope I get to know much better in the future.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Baylin's ring? - Yeah.
I saw it right there on ballantine's finger.
what do you think?
the man who just happens to be stephen's boss also just happens to be in possession of a ring
Baylin's ring-- that you pawned.
a ring that just so happens to be the only way of opening baylin's box that you happened to dig up out of that underground death trap.
what do I think? I think there's no such thing as coincidence.
I need to talk to foss about this.
Baylin told you not to trust him.
Baylin told me not to trust taylor.
I think taylor switched the message.
whatever.
you can't just sit back and wait for foss' blessing.
Amanda, it's kyle.
he's gonna be thrilled no matter what you wear.
trust me, if I wear something lame, he'll remember it.
okay, what's the matter?
I got a letter from this conservatory in new york.
I applied there a long time ago to study piano.
and I kind of got in.
that's awesome.
Oh, I would kill to get to go to new york.
I'm totally excited. It's just
it's for a whole semester, and
the long-distance thing.
it explains your attention to detail. - Yeah.
am I crazy to think it could work?
I mean, it's three time zones away.
with any other guy, I'd say don't waste your anytime minutes, but it's kyle.
he spent the last year pining over you from a distance.
I'm sure one semester won't even make a dent.
dig in. Don't worry.
there's, like, zero nutritional value in there.
no, thanks.
I can go back and get a turkey club, if you'd rather have that.
Josh, my stomach's kind of on edge.
I have a test tomorrow.
well, fear not.
I got a laser printer that can print, like, nanoscopic so I can make you the primo cheat sheet.
it's not that kind of test, josh.
you mean- - it's how the doctors are planning more chemo.
right.
you should get some popsicles, then.
no, I was reading online that chemo makes you really dehydrated, and one thing that helps is popsicles.
Josh-- - no, seriously.
what flavors do you like?
you know, just in case the cancer's back.
please don't use the c word.
the other c word.
remember when I said you couldn't talk to anyone about this?
well, that includes me.
homework?
Oh, god, it feels like it.
I've got that systems integration test coming up.
right.
well, ballantine sounded very impressed with you.
so, um...
Hey, you never really told me about your business trip.
you know, san francisco.
well, it was-- it was good.
it was work, but it was good.
and after everything that happened with my dad, it
it was just nice to get away.
Lori, could you get that?
well, I'm glad you got a break.
Yeah. And, uh, well, as it turns out, emily's got a few issues with her father, too.
she really understood.
well, I'm glad you had someone to talk to.
um, phone for you.
Thanks, hon.
hello.
Emily. Hi.
what's up?
Really?
well, that's good news.
but, hey, that's why we get paid the mid-range bucks.
Absolutely. Ah, no problem.
all right, you, too. Bye.
Oh, crap.
you scared me. Who was that?
uh, just someone from work.
um, listen, I'm gonna go take a shower, okay?
I love you, too, sweetie.
thanks for letting me come to work with you today.
just, uh, promise me you won't disassemble the mainframe.
I didn't like misleading stephen, but declan was right.
I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.
I had to face ballantine on his own ground, to try to figure out what we were up against.
you have no idea how delighted I was to hear you were coming to madacorp with stephen.
what brings you here today?
research for a project.
must be very important if they let you out of school.
there's a lot riding on it.
well, I hope I can lend a hand.
I appreciate that.
right this way.
thank you, mr. Ballantine.
I don't know if stephen has told you much about what he's been doing here, but he's working on the cir, short for cerebral impulse relay.
it's a lot like an advanced mri machine.
you know, I must admit I'm not much of a science person.
I'm more of a big picture kind of a guy.
well, what's the big picture of?
well, our hope is to help patients suffering from things like alzheimer's disease, stroke, and dementia recover from memory loss.
give them back that part of their lives before they've really lost it. Please.
ballantine's goal seemed like a noble one, but I couldn't help thinking he was only telling me part of the truth.
since an mri is basically a giant magnet, no one's allowed to bring anything metal into the lab.
your password, sir.
shall we?
security John Smith
Kyle, I'd like to introduce you to the cerebral impulse relay, or cir.
but we like to call it sir.
have a seat.
Oh, not to worry. She's not even online yet.
we're still working out some of the kinks.
but after the system's integration test, she'll be up and running.
maybe some other time.
count on it.
that ring came from baylin.
he made a point of leaving it to you. Why would you pawn it in the first place?
I tried to buy it back.
and this ballantine beat you to it. You know, this
this ring-- this ring is important.
more than you know. It
what do you mean?
look, you just should have told me sooner, that's all.
well, I would have if I'd known where you were.
well, you know what? What's done is done.
so what did you find out about ballantine?
that he must be hiding something, and there's enough security at madacorp to hide whatever it is he's hiding.
well, after taylor, that's one more person you can't trust.
what is-- what are you-- what is he doing here?
he wants to help us. - Him?
like you said, foss, kyle's running out of people he can trust.
help us do what?
get answers.
Ballantine invaded my home, my family, and my privacy.
I don't know what he's doing with my ring and what he wants with me or the tragers.
so what do you want to do?
I want to get my ring back.
I'm glad you came.
well, it's important for jessi.
come on in.
Thanks, nicole.
see you in an hour. - Right.
um, I-- I like your glasses.
Oh, yeah? I lost my contacts.
well, you should lose them more often. You look great.
Thanks. Bye.
come on.
the cameras we have to worry about are here, here, and here.
we can disable those, assuming they're on the same circuit.
then there are motion detectors, double-redundant I. D.Interfaces, and retina scanners.
what's the matter?
I just wonder where he comes in.
worry about yourself, foss. - Wrong.
I have to worry about you because you could get me killed.
we all have to work together on this.
we have one shot, one opportunity.
the system's integration test is the only time we know where ballantine will be, when he'll be there, and that he'll have to take his ring off.
that's our window.
it's tomorrow or nothing.
I don't know. I'm just seeing weird things.
weird how?
I have this memory of being in a fire.
I asked my sister about it, and she said there wasn't any fire.
sometimes it helps to draw the images.
it may help to clarify some things.
want to give it a try?
don't worry how it looks. Just...
draw what you feel.
did someone teach you to draw that way?
no. Am I doing it wrong?
no, no. You-- go on. You're doing fine.
and you're sure this will fool madacorp's retina scan?
as long as kyle can upload it into the security system.
the image is clean.
Amanda, you got my message.
Yeah. I got the tickets.
totally scored the orchestra seats.
are you all right? - Yes.
I'm sorry, but something came up.
what?
something important.
it happens.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
don't worry about it.
it's no big deal.
I'd better go.
mom, you got a minute? - Sure.
I need to talk to you, strictly confidential.
okay.
so you're not my mom, you're my therapist.
Andy has cancer.
Oh, no.
Oh, josh, I'm so sorry.
I finally meet a girl that I like
I mean, she's awesome. She likes to play g-force.
she loves zombie movies-- the unrated ones you think I don't watch.
and I want to help her through this, but she won't let me talk to her about it.
what would you say to her if you could?
I don't know.
something to make her feel better.
you may not have to say anything to do that.
Andy might just need you to hang in there with her, and if the time comes when she wants to talk, you'll be ready.
Paige AT SALLY'S PARTY 3: 30 BEACHWOOD COMMUNITY CENTER
hello.
it's kyle.
Hi. Is everything okay?
well, when I was in your office, I think I left my binder.
okay, well, I can bring it home with me.
I can pick it up.
it's kind of important, and I'm not that far away.
well, I'm heading to the systems integration test, but I can have security let you in.
Thanks.
no turning back now.
are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah.
are you?
Absolutely.
hello.
stephen trager, please.
he's not in. Can I take a message?
I'm calling from the stratford hotel.
Mr. Trager stayed here last weekend, and it seems he left his contact lenses in his room.
uh, my dad doesn't wear contacts.
are you certain?
he was the last guest to stay in that room. - Who is that?
wrong number.
okay.
here's hoping the test goes as well as it did in simulations.
well, you'll be fired if it doesn'T.
kidding.
but hollander's out on her ass.
Mr. Ballantine's office.
Hi, I've got a package down here for a mr. Ballantine that I need a signature for.
I'll be right down.
Thanks.
how do we bypass the security system?
once I get inside ballantine's office...
your password, sir.
I'll be able to access the madacorp mainframe.
that'll give me complete control of all the building's video cameras, doors, and retina scanners.
I'll be able to switch the image of foss' retina with ballantine'S.
and you know where you'll be.
Madacorp IS PEOPLE
let me go, man!
get off me!
I'm gonna take this punk upstairs.
get off me, man! I didn't do anything!
the truth is out there!
resistance is futile!
you have a package here for mr. Ballantine?
thank you, mr. Ballantine.
damn it, did you have to practically break my arm?
I had to look convincing.
why not just taser me?
I considered it.
don't mess this up.
that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
you copy, smith?
go for smith.
we got a report of a disturbance in the north b stairwell.
copy that.
you ARE TRAPPED
the guard will be detained...
and so will the assistant.
foss, you're good to go.
my code name at zzyzx.
what did ballantine have to do with zzyzx?
I need to see my dad right now.
miss, is he expecting you?
no, he's not expecting me.
it's a family emergency.
he's in the middle of a software test.
fine. I'll wait.
I had no idea what I'd find on ballantine's computer, but once I was there in front of it,
I had to take advantage of the opportunity.
I thought the experiments at zzyzx had ended with me.
well, looks like you two have your jobs for another day.
was that a congratulations? - I think so.
Lori, what's wrong?
I need to talk to you in private.
well, let's go to my office.
excuse me. - Of course.
looks like someone's upset over some contact lenses.
we got a problem.
did you get the ring? - No.
Ballantine has it.
he's headed your way.
get out now.
Mr. Ballantine, there appears to have been a security breach.
are you paige? - Mm-hmm.
Where's your mommy?
away.
what's wrong?
I wanted a lion.
can I have a crayon?
who are you?
just a friend.
what's going on?
honey, whatever it is, you can tell me.
are you having an affair with emily?
why would you think that?
the hotel called, the one you stayed at on your business trip.
they said you left your contact lenses in the room.
I don't wear contacts.
I know.
but emily does.
Oh, honey, the hotel made a mistake.
I'm just afraid you did.
Lori, nothing happened.
I've seen how you act when she calls.
you get all happy and excited.
we work together. She understands what I do.
does she understand that you're married?
Oh! - Oh!
I'm sorry. - That's okay.
no problem.
that guard is kyle's handler.
did you get the ring? - No.
we got to get out of here.
wait. Where's foss?
he's coming.
there he is.
ballantine's headed this way.
wait. - What?
is he close? - Yes.
we got to go.
can you stop the doors from automatically retracting?
I can.
what?
MacGyver reruns.
the problem seemed complex, but the math was a simple mix of algebra and geometry.
the angle of the incidence equals the angle of reflection on the madacorp logo.
Kyle!
come on, man.
that gave me ballantine's distance.
distance divided by the time told me that he'd reach the elevator in...
three, two, one.
do it now.
lock down the building now.
the building is now on lockdown.
there's an emergency exit out in the lobby.
are you okay?
uh, I'm fine.
you're not fine.
come on. Get up.
come on.
we got company.
just leave me. - No.
they're coming.
get him out of here.
what are you gonna do? - Buy you some time.
we're not leaving you.
listen to me.
the ring is all you need. - What?
now go.
thank you.
get out of here!
we need backup, level 3!
stupid ankle.
I have to go back. - You can'T.
they'll take the ring, and all this will have been for nothing.
but foss-- - he wanted you to get that ring back.
I hope it's worth it.
sir, we got this one, but the others got away.
take him to room 237.
move it.
a kiss for mommy?
I missed you.
Oh, I missed you more.
is this me?
no. That's my new friend.
your new friend?
Yeah. She made me these.
okay, sweetie, let's go.
I was just returning a cd of lori'S.
did you have fun, doing whatever you had to do?
I wish I could have gone to the concert with you.
it's okay.
I understand.
actually, I don't understand.
one minute you're thrilled to spend time with me and all excited to go to the concert, and then you cancel without telling me why.
you say it's important, but you won't tell me why it's important.
I know what's going on.
you do?
I rushed you into this.
admit it. Now you're having doubts.
I do have doubts, but
if that's the way you feel, there's something I really need to tell you
no.
Amanda, I have doubts about everything in my life...
except how I feel about you.
I just
what did you need to tell me?
not important.
wow, How bad do you suck?
well, you do.
gonna give me a chance?
at the game?
aren't you working?
you're just afraid that I'll smoke you.
right.
dream much?
I got the test results.
And?
let's just say I'm gonna need a lot of popsicles.
cherry okay?
my favorite.
want half?
cool.
my turn? - Hit it.
I'm gonna try the-- oops.
Mr. Ballantine?
your appointment is here.
send him in.
it's nice to finally meet you, mr. Taylor.
pleasure.
we had a little security breach.
someone stole my ring, but it's being taken care of.
it had better be.
no need for alarm. It was just A...
heirloom from my late father.
an heirloom.
that heirloom is a latnock ring.
you people and your rings.
forgive me if I don't lose any sleep over a glorified pledge pin.
you really don't have any idea how important that ring is.
do you?
Adam baylin's secret had been locked inside this box for 15 years, almost as long as I'd been alive.
would his secrets provide the answers to my own?
or simply raise more questions?
there was only one way to know for sure.
northeast Sacramento
Jane? Care to join us?
the moon's at perigee, closest to the earth.
it's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, it is, but the victim is over here.
I know.
work.
victim's name's Eleanor Artega, shot in the chest.
there were reports of gunshots around 11: 00.
is she from the neighborhood?
ID gives an address across town, but one of the SACPD officers said she grew up in the neighborhood.
her mother runs a grocery a few blocks away.
pretty dress.
maybe she was wedding?
performance, more like it. She's a musician.
some kind of stringed instrument. - Because?
because of the calluses on her fingertips and the faint piney scent of rosin on her dress.
been a couple of gang initiation could be another one.
I'll talk to the SACPD gang unit, see who's active.
we'll canvass the looky loos.
hydrangea petal.
interesting decoration for a gang slaying, unless the crips have taken up flower arranging,
which I can definitely see the therapeutic benefits of.
thank you.
evidence, I believe.
come on.
and I'm looking for current information on norte ?
call me back as soon as possible. Thanks.
damn, man. You see I'm walking here, right?
you walked into me. - Hell I did.
you need to get behind the line. Police only here,
trying to find out who killed that lady?
you know somethin' about it?
do I look like a snitch to you?
keep walkin'.
go on.
anything would be useful, so if you wouldn't mind, just...
just give us a call and, uh, thank you very much for your time.
I know it's slow, but it's how the work is done.
Yeah, I could point out someone that knows something useful with 25 words or less.
Oh, really?
count 'em.
evening.
I have $100 for information about the victim.
100.
Oops.
it's not $100.
just $1...
for information.
any takers?
25.
the point being...
the gentleman in the plaid shirt with the beanie didn't even consider raising his hand.
that means he has information that not even $100 can buy.
sir? Uh, you in the plaid, We're gonna have to ask you some questions.
Cho, we got a runner! Get the car! Head off around the block!
someone took my keys.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop the car!
thanks for the ride, sucka!
come on, Starsky, let's go get him. I'll drive.
gonna walk home?
ms. Artega, we're very sorry for your loss,
but we need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
I have work to do.
ma'am, what did Eleanor do for living?
she was a concert violinist with the orchestra.
dawn, I sad the first shelf for these.
sorry, Ms. Artega.
first chair violin,
the concertmaster,
second to the conductor himself.
youngest in symphony history.
you must have been very proud.
proud, yes.
I was her manager. We were a team.
do you know why Eleanor was in the neighborhood last night?
she came here.
she had given a solo performance,
a special event. She wanted to tell me about it.
can you think of anyone who may have wanted to harm her?
a boyfriend maybe?
she wasn't seeing anyone. No time.
she used to have a boyfriend.
gangbanger.
they dated about a year or so.
why would he want to hurt her?
Eleanor broke it off six months ago.
he wouldn't leave her alone.
he called, came to the apartment.
we had to get a restraining order! Ay!
mop!
how am I gonna clean this up?
how am I gonna...
Oh, my Ellie!
Oh, my baby.
why did they do this to you?
Why?!
Hey, boss.
so I confirmed that Eleanor Artega played a private event the night that she was murdered, "A brescian stradivarius violin."
I'm assuming that's a good one. What about the boyfriend?
orlando Yglesias. He's got a sheet, some low-Level stuff.
he runs with a Norte the, uh, Lincoln Avenue hermanos.
Eleanor did have a restraining order on him.
this is the guy that fled the scene last night,
the one that Jane picked out from the crowd.
call SACPD gang unit.
tell them we need any help they can give finding this guy.
okay, you got it.
we've got a little homicide investigation going on here.
you care to join us?
Yeah, I'm--I'm a little busy right now.
brahms's concerto in D minor.
Eleanor's the soloist. She's very good, very elegant, uh, rubato.
music later.
we have a viable suspect-- The victim's ex-boyfriend.
wild goose chase, I hope.
you hope? Why?
well, because if it is, the boyfriend is boring, tragic, but dull, which is to be avoided at all costs.
where you going?
you Cho? - That's right.
beller, SACPD.
I picked him up on Bellwood in the northwest.
got your car, too. It's on its way.
Thanks. Juvenile services is?
they're backed up. They can't process him for 48 hours at the least.
social worker says his mother passed away.
his father's in jail.
she thinks we should release him back to his foster family.
what gang put you up to this?
I don't belong to a gang.
stealing a cop car. That's an initiation.
you're jumping in with somebody. Who?
beasty mob? True heights villains?
sir, I don't know ?
hang on to him. Juvenile services'll get to him eventually.
Yeah. No, I have a court appearance today.
I gotta unload him. He's all yours.
I okayed it with your boss already.
you're joking.
no joke.
thanks for your help, officer Beller. We appreciate the assist.
no problem.
boss...
SACPD are not babysitters.
he stole your keys. He's your problem.
make sure he doesn't take anything else.
sir, you gotta believe me when I say how sorry I am.
don't talk.
no, really, I'm sorry. - Not buying it.
come on.
whatever, punk.
that's more like it.
Mr. Jane?
Hi. I'm kieran carruthers, the company's outreach assistant.
front office said I might find you here.
Yes, I'm the principal oboist.
definitely Oboe-Esque.
concertmaster sits, uh, here, yes?
Yes. - Mm.
interesting bookmark.
Yeah, looks like an expensive one.
Really?
you know, if you tell me what you're looking for, I might be able to help.
I'm looking for a killer.
Eleanor's killer? Here?
you're musicians, professional obsessors.
most kids spend their teen years having fun.
you spent them practicing scales.
it's a noble pursuit, but as a result, you're all a little nutty.
well, uh, okay, I don't know ?
there's a definite air of unrest in the room.
what is that about?
right. We're supposed to start our season a day after tomorrow.
opening night, big fund-raising meet and greet with our donors.
some of us thought we should postpone because of Eleanor, but the, uh, maestro didn't agree.
your conductor--a tyrant?
Vincent Manheiser. I wouldn't say he's a tyrant.
he's just... not nice.
all right, let's get to work.
see for yourself.
come on, people. Let's go.
haven't got all day. Up, up, up. Come on.
all right.
Yes, maestro?
you will take Eleanor's seat as concertmaster.
you've not shown any of her natural gifts of leadership,
but under the circumstances, we shall have to make do, yes?
I'll do my best, sir.
your keen lust for advancement will be gratified.
second seat for you.
Yes, maestro.
from the top.
and...
Yep. Orlando Yglesias.
okay. Thanks.
gang unit's gonna ask around,
check out where the victim's ex-boyfriend hangs.
good.
there you go.
I can't eat this.
why not?
I'm a vegetarian.
now it's vegetarian.
Hey. Pick it up.
you better not mess with Cho, man.
he used to be an Avon Park playboy.
you were a playboy? - Oh, yeah. That's right.
runs with the south side mafia.
never heard of him. I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Wayne, I'm getting coffee. Want some?
uh, no, thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
what is this? - What?
I want you, baby. Come to me?
is this some kind of a joke?
I didn't send that.
well, it's on your phone. - Well, my phone is on my desk.
Hey. Who's watching the kid?
Hey!
nice try.
let's go.
I had him. - Yeah.
you can't do this. I'm a minor.
too bad.
I know I shouldn't have messed with you.
I can't be here.
I gotta go, for real.
gang unit just called back.
they say Orlando's crew hangs at 8th and market.
we should go sit on it.
you're looking for Orlando Yglesias, right?
I know him. He's from the neighborhood.
you ain't gonna find him at 8th and market.
why not?
cause that's where the hermanos hang.
Orlando's not with them no more.
gang unit says different.
they don't know.
jumped into a new gang a couple months ago.
yeah? Which one?
cut me loose, and I'll tell you.
the local pimps.
house on Lex and Tremont. That's their spot.
gang unit says the information's six months old.
kid could be right.
wouldn't hurt to check it out.
Lex and Tremont's close.
if Orlando doesn't show up, we'll swing by the other location.
let's go.
you're dragging, people!
stay in tempo!
stop! Stop. Stop.
B-Flat? It's ridiculous, even for you.
while we're on the subject, Ann, Carol, you're dragging.
trumpets, measure 37.
soggy.
I thought it sounded perfectly lovely. Bravo.
you're awfully picky, aren't you?
who are you?
never mind. Go. Leave now.
I'm with the CBI. I'm here about the murder.
uh, if you'll please wait outside...
you hate being interrupted, don't you?
as a matter of fact, I do.
interesting. I have one question, then I'll leave.
I know it was you that murdered Eleanor Artega.
I just need to know why, Vincent.
why did you kill her?
you are crazy. - Aha.
that is exactly--exactly what I thought you would say, now I know for sure.
Yes.
you, sir, are a cold-blooded murderer...
and you will get what you deserve.
I did not kill Eleanor Artega.
are you sure of that? - Very sure.
Meh. Well, it's worth a try.
worth a try?
Yeah, the old "it was you" gambit.
guilty people often fold up at that point...
guilty people with a conscience, that is, which means you're either innocent,
or you're a cold, heartless monster...
or both.
this is an outrageous abuse of authority.
it still might be you, and if it is...
justice will find you.
what?
we're wasting our time.
Orlando's not gonna show up. The kid played us.
sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
he knows how to sell it.
Ah, he doesn't seem that bad to me.
I used to be that kid.
any chance to mess with a cop, I'd do it.
Hey, check it out.
that's Orlando, isn't it? - Yeah. Go. Go.
let me see your hands. Do it.
tell me about Eleanor.
orlando, you want to talk after spending the night in a holding cell, that's your right.
but tomorrow morning, I am still gonna be asking you the same questions.
what you want to know?
you were an unlikely couple.
Eleanor was in the orchestra. She was moving her way up.
you weren't. Then she dumps you.
must have been stressful.
did it make you angry?
Yeah, here we go, jamming me up for this.
I'm just askin'.
I wasn't angry.
Eleanor was all about music, always.
wasn't gonna let me or anyone else get in the way of that.
I respected that.
then why'd you keep calling, going over to her apartment?
we were cool.
there was no reason not to hang.
except a restraining order.
her mother made her do that. She told me.
her mom thought I was moving in again 'cause I came by a couple times.
if you're such a stand-up guy, why did you run from the crime scene?
I wouldn't hurt El.
didn't want nothin' but good for her.
believe it, don't...
I don't control you.
I talked to the clerk of the judge who issued the restraining order.
Orlando's right.
Eleanor did ask for it, but her mother was the driving force.
that's not what Isabella said.
also, I checked Eleanor's e-mails.
Eleanor fired Isabella as her manager and hired a new one just a couple weeks ago.
new manager says Eleanor and her mother weren't speaking.
they spoke before she died. Go talk to Isabella again.
find out what they really said.
okay, I'm on it.
you sleep here.
the door will be locked, but there's someone down the hall.
you need anything, just bang on the door, okay?
but I'm leaving tomorrow, right?
depends on when juvenile services gets here.
juvenile services?
we had a deal. - There was no deal.
come on, man. Don't punk out on me.
I'm not kidding. I need to get out of here.
well, you should have before you stole a car.
no, I've got business. - It'll have to wait.
let me go!
get off of me, man!
Hey. Stop. Stop. - Get off of me, man!
look at me. Look at me.
what's this really about?
hmm?
I'm not leaving until you tell me.
my dad got arrested.
they say he robbed a liquor store, but he didn't.
all right.
he didn't.
he's got an alibi.
dude named Jayden Stephens.
but Jayden won't come forward.
he's got warrants out on him, so he's hiding.
but my dad's going on trial next week.
I can't find Jayden, my dad's going to prison.
that's why i stole your car.
Jayden's running with the true heights villains.
I was thinking if I can jump in with them,
they'd tell me where he's hiding.
figured they'd know.
you were joining a gang to get your father out of prison.
Yeah.
try to get some sleep.
we know Eleanor fired you as her manager.
why didn't you tell us that?
I didn't think it was important.
well, you must've talked about it the night Eleanor came here and she was killed.
we did.
she wanted to make up. I didn't.
I should've, but I didn't.
so the last time you spoke, you fought?
are you asking if I killed my daughter?
no, ma'am, I'm just trying to get the facts straight.
Yes, she is.
I mean, come on, you are.
most kids never make it out of this neighborhood.
Eleanor did, because I gave her everything so she could have a better life.
why would I hurt her?
grace, it's clear as day.
Isabella had nothing to do with her daughter's death.
more importantly, was Eleanor into cats?
cats? No.
what about ancient egypt, Pyramids? Mummies?
no. She never talked to me about Egypt.
okay. Thanks. Let's roll.
so to all our donors, our board members,
our most loyal supporters,
I say thank you.
is that for Ariel?
more of a red wine girl, I would think.
how'd you know this was for her?
well, clearly, you've got a thing for her.
word to the wise-- She likes the bad boys.
Oh, you're back. - Mm.
don't let Vincent see you.
I think I can take him.
so can I watch? That was fun last time.
this is not a joke, Ariel. I'm following up on an important clue.
it could very well break the case.
well, come on.
you're gonna tell us, right?
he can't, Ariel. - Oh, we won't say anything.
promise. - I'd like to know.
well, I suppose you're gonna hear soon enough.
Eleanor was in a relationship with someone from the orchestra.
I suspected as much.
who was it?
uh, I can't.
it couldn't be Douglas, could it?
think bigger. That's all I'm saying.
it wasn't...
no.
are you serious? - Deadly.
Mm.
and he was abusing her...
sexually.
that's awful. - Yes. Shh.
Oh, my... - I don't see it.
Mr. Rome, I'm Kimball Cho with the CBI.
your son Anthony tells me you're innocent of the charge you're facing.
is that true?
Anthony told you that? - Yeah.
how you know my son?
that's not important right now.
I'm giving you a chance to say you didn't do the crime.
you're not gonna take it?
no. No, I didn't do it.
da says you did.
Yeah, a store owner picked me out of a lineup.
bad witness ID. That's all.
but you know how hard that is to beat, right?
and you've robbed a lot of stores, haven't you?
not anymore. That is all behind me.
since when?
since Anthony's mother passed about a year ago.
I've been trying to step up, do better.
look, I even got a new construction job.
and you run with the south side mafia.
how do they feel about you stepping up?
I'm jumping out as soon as I put all this behind me.
you've had a year to jump out. What are you waiting for?
man, the hell with you!
you don't know me!
da offered you two years.
you could do that much time easily.
why'd you turn it down?
two years of my boy in foster care, out there on the streets? He would be dead or in a cell with me.
no. I been gone too long.
I have got to get outta here.
tell me about Jayden Stephens.
I got your message.
just in time. The fun will soon begin.
what's going on?
Ahem. It's just horrible, isn't it?
what is, ma'am?
our conductor...
has been having an illicit relationship with our poor, dear Eleanor.
no. - Yes.
and he hit her.
Allison! Excuse me. - You're excused.
you. Why?
lure out the real lover.
Oops. Gotta go.
and you know this because?
cats and Egypt-- Eleanor wasn't into them.
the bookmark--She didn't buy it for herself, and it's too expensive for a casual gift.
someone was trying very hard to impress her.
now thanks to the rumor mill, that person thinks that Vincent was sleeping with Eleanor.
add in a couple of glasses of champagne, and if I haven't missed the mark...
you son of a bitch.
I have no idea what you're talking about. - Don't lie to me.
go home and sober up.
that's enough! Get off of him! Come on!
now. Break it up! Break it up now!
break it up.
break it up! Enough! Enough!
let me know if you need me to call for backup.
Constance, we know you bought Eleanor that bookmark.
we found the charge on your credit card records.
you were in love with her, weren't you?
Yes, I was.
when did you tell her?
a few weeks ago.
she was really, really nice, but...
she wasn't interested.
did that upset you?
I suppose a little.
Mm. You have a temper, don't you?
no. Hardly at all.
Oh, you got pretty angry at Vincent.
that was different.
I-I thought...
I heard Vincent hurt Eleanor.
I... I didn't think that was right.
and what about the night Eleanor died?
did you have a temper then?
you knew she was playing that night.
it wouldn't have been that hard to follow her.
you can't be serious.
I don't think the fact that Vincent had abused Eleanor is what upset you.
I think you couldn't stand her being with somebody else.
no.
all right, then explain this for me then.
why was the gun that killed Eleanor in your car?
what?
a few hours ago, we found it in your trunk.
that isn't mine.
It's...Th-That's not mine. It isn't.
that's not really an explanation of how it got there.
I...I-I want a lawyer.
please.
so... Constance.
we're charging her.
then we can all rest easy.
Mm.
say it.
she didn't do it.
we found the weapon in her car.
didn't do it.
unless you have actual evidence that exonerates her, we have to charge her.
if she were the killer, she would have exhibited some measure of guilt.
all I observed was sincere grief.
actual evidence.
okay. The gauntlet's been thrown down.
when you searched Constance's car, did you notice any flowers?
no. Why?
she's all yours.
Hey, Osvaldo.
how's it going in the DA's office?
not so good.
we need to talk about agent Cho.
Ardiles is prosecuting Rome.
I'm told you visited Rome in jail. Is that true?
why do you wanna know?
why...
uh, because Mr. Rome's lawyer has sent me an updated witness list with the name Jayden Stephens on it, which is interesting, because as far as i can tell, Jayden Stephens is a convenient figment of Mr. Rome's imagination.
but now according to Mr. Rome's lawyer, even though you have nothing to do with this,
you said you'd track down this Mr. Stephens,
thereby providing Mr. Rome with an alibi, potentially screwing my case.
that's why I need to know, agent Cho.
answer him.
Yes, I did that.
agent, do you know who, uh, Asante James and Rodrick Pierce are?
no.
well, they're only the, uh, top two lieutenants in the south side mafia.
probably a dozen bodies on each.
lawrence Rome worked with them.
you want Lawrence to flip?
well, that's the idea. - Lawrence won't flip.
Really? Why not? - He knows they'd kill him.
right. And you know so much about that?
more than you, I guess.
agent, do I have to take this upstairs? Because i'm ready.
no, you don't.
Hey, this is not our case.
Rome's attorney or the DA's office can look for Jayden Stephens.
we should not get involved.
good.
then we're in agreement.
we shouldn't get involved.
got it.
Where's the kid?
juvenile services just took him.
let go of me, man. Man, let go of me!
listen, zip your mouth. - Let go of me!
Hey! Hold on. - Listen to me, pal.
easy, son, easy.
what's up? - I'm agent Cho.
I'll take the kid off your hands. - What?
I made a mistake. Let's just forget i filed a report, okay?
it's my case now.
besides, it took me an hour to get here.
I'm not going back empty-handed.
now do you mind?
Hey, hey.
give him to me. - Sorry. Can't do that.
he hit you. That's battery.
are you kidding me?
I have to process him now. Paperwork.
hold on. - Bye.
Hey. This is bull!
what are you doing, man? - Be quiet or I'll give you back.
I thought the police work was over.
Oh, I just stopped by to congratulate you.
I'm sorry. Me?
you are the new concertmaster, aren't you? Now that constance is in the pokey.
Thanks.
it's not exactly something that deserves congratulations.
when you heard about the promotion, what was the first thought that popped into your head?
sadness... relief.
you know, just last week I was thinking of leaving here and trying my luck elsewhere.
now... - mm.
well, you got what you wanted.
you're pleased and... yet you feel guilty.
it's perfectly understandable.
I need to get back to rehearsing.
don't mind me.
excuse me.
do you know if there's a good florist nearby?
who wants to know?
Hey, CBI. Let me see your hands.
all right.
we're gonna talk about Lawrence Rome.
we can talk. Let's talk.
get up.
what the hell's going on here?
get outta the way. - Or what?
keep breathing. You'll be fine.
for you.
does it squirt water?
no. No trick.
maybe just a little trick. Catch the killer.
with a hydrangea? - Yeah.
how?
well, wouldn't that be spoiling the fun?
for you. Spoiling the fun for you.
we're dropping charges against Lawrence Rome.
I see.
personally, I think the alibi is bogus, but we had to interview the store owner again.
now he says, uh, maybe his ID was wrong.
maybe it wasn't Lawrence Rome.
whole thing's gone down the toilet.
we had an agreement.
I agreed I shouldn't help. Didn't say I wouldn't.
from now on, you get nothing from the DA's office.
no favors, no help.
not just you, but every agent in this unit.
you have screwed things for your people, my friend.
six months from now, Lawrence Rome will be back inside for ripping off another liquor store, his kid'll be back in foster care, and the south side mafia will be stronger than ever.
you're wrong.
you wanna bet on that?
on the stage, on the other side of the stairs.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
stop! Stop! Stop!
you're my rock! Never a wrong note. What is going on?!
I'm sorry, maestro, just...
I'm not feeling very well.
what is the matter?
I can answer that.
what's he doing here?
fabulous suit, by the way.
Kieran's not so much feeling sick as he is feeling guilty.
sick with guilt because it was him that killed Eleanor.
come on.
hydrangeas don't lie.
well, if they could speak, they wouldn't lie.
what are you talking about?
somebody gave Eleanor a bouquet of hydrangeas the night of the murder.
after you shot Eleanor, you swiped them,
leaving behind a single petal.
and when you saw them, you couldn't help remembering that night.
you felt guilty.
it killed your concentration.
because you framed her.
precisely.
the question remains why would a man kill the first chair violinist?
and then frame the second chair?
because with the first and second chair out of the picture, the third takes first.
Kieran here has a little crush on you.
well, let's not beat around the bush here, Kieran.
it's more of an obsession.
he'd heard that you'd been thinking about leaving the orchestra.
then he would lose you.
so he had to shake things up.
it's not true. Okay, this is because I played a few wrong notes?
this is crazy!
it was just a feeling that he had, a little hunch.
he always had faith in you.
you stay away from me.
no, Ariel. Wait, Ariel, wait. No, no. Wait. Wait.
Ariel, listen. No, Ariel. No! - Calm down.
I just want to make you happy! - That is enough.
maestro, take five. - Okay.
Eleanor was nothing compared to Ariel.
she didn't have the technique.
so after rehearsal that night, I followed Eleanor to her performance.
why'd you take the flowers?
he didn't think Eleanor deserved them. Isn't that right?
ariel is ten times the player.
she deserved the recognition.
if I had to give it to her, so be it.
very gallant.
still, I wouldn't expect a conjugal.
dad!
Oh, what's up, man?
I missed you so much.
Oh! Look at you. God, look at you.
come on.
I missed you.
all right. Give me a minute.
I talked to the gang unit.
if you haven't jumped out in a month, they'll let me know.
I said I would.
you have a chance. Don't mess it up.
what's this punk saying to you, dad?
easy. Easy, little man. We just--We just talking.
Hey, Cho. We got a new one. We're heading out in a minute.
Thanks, Mr. Rigsby.
I really appreciate everything.
uh, yeah. Um, no problem.
that was weird. I barely talked to the kid.
check your pockets.
my wallet. Damn it!
hold the elevator!
mind if I...

I'm with a patient now.
can you call back at 2: 1 5?
I don't think I'll be free.
give me your number.
I'll call you tonight.
Hello?
Hello?
I'll call you back. Thanks.

push off, Jarrett!
push off!
is he actually inclined to lose?
well, regionally.
it's too bad.
I mean...
it's tragic, really.
look at him now.
he's lost everything.
fish too dry?
it's not too dry.
C&S has a new mechanic.
what happened to Harry?
I think he moved to Skokie.
this new mechanic is so awkward.
is that shirt ripped?
leave it on the table in the hallway.
wasn't that girl in the hospital from Skokie?
what was her name?
[ Beth ] Will you play round robin at the club?
I haven't played in a year.
well, isn't it time to start?
we're going to Clark Murray's birthday party Saturday.
I bought him that book on wine.
not the Murrays.
cut the rope, now, Bucky!
we're going in!
give me your hand!
Hi. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
couldn't be better. Terrific. Yeah.
come in. They all do that.
come in.
sit down.
I just have to...
wire some...
volume.
sorry. Sit down.
you have trouble finding the place?
not yet.
how long since you've been out of the hospital?
a month and a half.
feeling depressed?
no.
on stage?
pardon me?
people nervous...
treating you like you're a dangerous character?
Yeah, I guess a little.
are you?
I don't know.
how long were you in the hospital?
four months.
what did you do?
I tried to off myself.
it doesn't say what your method was.
double-edged Super Blue.
Oh.
is everybody glad to see you home?
Yeah.
friends?
Yeah.
you're back in school.
everything okay there? Teachers?
Yeah.
no problems?
Uh-uh.
so why are you here?
uh...
I'd like to be more in control.
Why?
so people can quit worrying about me.
who's worried about you?
my father, mostly.
this is his idea.
and your mother?
isn't she worried, too?
I don't know.
look, I'll be straight with you.
I don't like this already.
as long as you're straight.
have you talked to Crawford?
Yes. He called me.
he told me to look for you.
he said you had a brother who died.
boating accident, wasn't it?
want to tell me about it?
you talked this over with Crawford, right?
right.
how did that go?
it didn't change anything.
what needed changing?
I'd like to be more in control.
Why?
so people can quit worrying about me.
well, I'll tell you something.
I'll be straight with you, okay?
I'm not big on control.
but it's your money.
so to speak.
so to speak.
okay.
how's Tuesdays...
and Fridays, same time?
twice a week?
well, control's a tough nut.
I've got swim practice every night.
well, that's a problem.
how do we solve that?
guess I'll skip practice twice a week.
well, it's up to you.
I don't like being here.
I don't like it at all.
Mm-hmm.
I saw Mort Swain. His sister died.
the one from Idaho?
the one with the restaurant.
she died in Idaho?
I guess so.
Why?
you said she was always traveling.
I don't know.
maybe in Idaho.
maybe Kansas City.
I went to see Dr. Berger.
Yeah.
you didn't say anything. Good!
I went today.
I didn't know you made an appointment.
how was it?
it's a lot of money.
it's okay.
it's $50 an hour, twice a week.
it's okay. It is necessary.
what did you talk about?
not much.
what about your schedule?
well, it'll cut into swim practice.
Where's his office?
head straight!
I don't want to tell you again.
this is what I see.
I see you yawning and you coming late.
I don't see you having fun.
are you getting enough sleep?
Yeah.
are you having fun?
fun?
there's no point if you're not having fun.
Yeah, I guess so.
you guess so.
are you on medication?
tranquilizers?
anything?
no. No, sir.
did I ask you if they gave you shock?
Yeah.
yeah what?
Yeah, you asked me.
Yeah, they did.
don't look at us, Lazenby.
get in the water!
I'm no doctor, Jarrett.
I wouldn't let them put electricity in my head.
he drives me nuts!
everybody drives you nuts.
don and Fenetch looked good.
they looked very good.
is he giving you a hard time?
want a clarinet?
van Buren wants a clarinet.
who's selling it?
my brother. He needs a motorcycle.
you stand behind me in the choir.
Oh, I do? Is that you?
you have a lot of energy.
I do?
I mean, that's good.
my name's Jeannine Pratt.
nice. Hi.
you're Conrad Jarrett.
right.
Yeah. Um, bye.
Bye-bye.
you've got a lot of energy. "
[ children ] Trick or treat!
you're the scariest ghost I've ever seen!
you look wonderful.
thank you.
there you go.
be careful.
thank you. Good-bye.
the Cabots. Julie's first time.
she's so cute!
ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
know what I've been thinking?
that Christmas in London...
would be like something out of Dickens.
we've never done that before.
maybe we shouldn't plan to go away right now.
we talked about it.
we decided on that.
Yeah, I know that.
but the timing doesn't seem right.
we've always gone away at Christmas.
it'd be good for him, too.
let's get back to normal.
he's just started with this doctor.
he'll miss three weeks.
why interrupt it?
because I want to get away.
I think we should. It's important.
not if he doesn't go through with this now.
he might change his mind.
if he changes his mind...
it wasn't right for him.
does he want to go?
he doesn't know what he wants.
Ahh!
don't do that!
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were here.
I just got in.
no golf today. Too cold.
how was golf?
I didn't play.
it's colder today.
I mean, for the year, it's colder.
weren't you swimming?
Yeah. Sorry I scared you.
how'd it go?
good. I swam well.
good.
I could swim the 50 if my
my timing got better.
I'm a little off.
you must work at that.
Yeah.
I got 7 4 on a Trig quiz.
gee, I was awful at Trig.
Oh, yeah? Did you
you took Trig?
wait a minute.
did I take Trig?
I bought you two shirts. They're on your bed.
who'll be there?
well, the Murrays, the Gunthers, and the Caines.
let's go to the movies instead.
don't be negative.
that's not negative. That's unpredictable.
let's go to the movies.
okay.
Really?
okay, yeah. Come on. Let's go.
what's our excuse?
Beth wanted to go to the movies.
good.
very good.
all right now, smile.
remember, not too many martinis.
will you put that with the others?
look. We're in time.
look who's here!
three blocks away and the last to arrive.
come on in.
happy birthday! You look wonderful.
is that new?
Yes, it is. Do you like it?
you did the mousse?
it turned out well?
Hey, partner. How are you?
hi there.
Hi, Beth.
good to see you.
borrow the money.
I'll go public.
I wouldn't do it now because the market's low.
your hair looks wonderful.
it's shorter. You like it?
I said, ""Please put out your cigar. "
he says, ""Huh? I don't have another one. "
good to see you!
you look beautiful, as ever.
in school...
they think they've got to walk on the edge of danger.
what are these hushed tones?
he told the funniest joke!
I'm not talking to you.
Why?
I have my fingers crossed on this merger.
let's have lunch.
I don't know my schedule.
I'm free most days.
Bob McLean's leaving Coles and Johnson.
where is he going?
he doesn't know.
Jesus.
no, you didn't.
isn't he the meanest man you've met?
when a ball is in play, if a player or caddy accidentally move it...
Hi, Annie. What's your boy up to?
Oh, who knows?
how's Conrad doing?
he's great. Just great.
I asked Donald. He says they haven't talked much.
I said maybe he's self-conscious.
Oh!
no, no, no.
no, he's
there's a doctor in Highland Park...
that he sees twice a week.
he's great. Just great.
is he still having some problems?
no, nothing like that.
just somebody to talk to...
to polish off the rough edges.
how are you, darling?
is he falling asleep on you?
Nah. He's great.
Hey.
you drank too much.
I'm not drunk.
why did you tell Annie about Conrad's psychiatrist?
why not?
people don't hear that thing easily.
for most people, it's a status symbol.
well, your blurting it out...
was a violation of privacy.
whose privacy?
the family's privacy!
I think it is a very private matter.
I tell you my dreams?
I don't believe in dreams.
what kind of a psychiatrist are you?
what's happening?
what's going on?
I just feel
I feel so
what?
jumpy. I don't know.
look, kiddo...
I lied.
I believe in dreams.
sometimes I want to know what's happening when you're awake.
something's making you nervous.
maybe I need a tranquilizer.
tranquilizer?
what do you think?
you look like something out of The Body Snatchers.
it's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer.
what is this?
a clock.
you can tell the time, but I can't.
so you know when the hour's up?
right.
50, 55 minutes?
maybe I don't want to swim anymore.
my timing is for shit.
two guys better than me swim the 50.
they're a bunch of boring jocks.
and him-- I can't stand him.
thought about quitting?
you telling me to?
Nope.
it wouldn't look good.
how does it feel?
how does it feel?
Yes. How does it feel?
it's the same damn thing I did last year.
are you the same person now?
that's why you need a tranquilizer?
you're a doctor.
I'm supposed to feel better, right?
not necessarily.
is it getting any easier with your friends?
no. It's still hard.
is any place easy?
the hospital was.
it was? Why?
because nobody hid anything there.
was there anyone there you could talk to?
Uh-huh.
I mean, beside Dr. Crawford?
Uh-huh.
Whoa!
Hi.
how are you?
good.
sit down, please.
thank you.
Wow.
when did you get back?
the end of August.
good.
it's great to see you.
Oh, you, too.
listen, I've got a meeting over at the school.
drama Club meeting.
we're doing A Thousand Clowns.
you know it?
anyway, we're going crazy getting it together.
don't let me hang you up.
no. I wanted to see you.
I didn't know what to expect.
you sounded funny on the phone.
it was just a gray day.
everything's great. I'm on the swim team.
Oh, you're swimming?
terrific, Conrad.
that's really wonderful.
I could be benched all year.
you'll do great.
I'll bet your folks are real proud of you.
Yeah.
what can I get you?
are you hungry?
just a coke.
two cokes, please.
did we offend him?
something I said?
a low self-image day.
so, uh
are you-- - What did
I can't believe how beautiful you look.
you really look beautiful.
so do you.
do you miss it?
miss what?
the hospital.
no.
thank you.
you don't miss it?
no.
you don't miss Leo's corny jokes?
are you seeing a doctor?
Yeah, I'm seeing one. Are you?
uh, Dr. Crawford gave me a name.
I went for a while.
it didn't work.
he told me the things I already knew.
finally, I decided...
the only one who can help me is myself.
at least, that's what my dad says.
if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing.
I don't know how long I'll keep it up.
your hair grew in.
Oh. That was such a dumb thing to do.
I like it.
you do?
Yeah.
I don't know. I just
I miss it sometimes.
the hospital.
I really do.
things have to change, you know?
but that's where we laughed.
but that was a hospital.
this is the real world.
I guess you're right.
I really have to go.
I'm sorry.
I have a meeting at the school.
we're doing A Thousand Clowns.
you told me.
did I?
Yeah.
I better hurry.
don't want to be late.
thanks for seeing me.
let's have a great Christmas.
okay?
let's have...
a great year.
let's have the best year of our lives.
this could be the best year ever.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
will you call me?
Yeah.
you mean it?
Yep.
you, uh
you look good, Conrad.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Hey!
would you cheer up?
it's cold.
you should put that on.
do you want a sweater?
do I need one?
what are you doing?
nothing.
thinking.
about what?
not about anything.
your hair is starting to grow out.
it's looking-- looking better.
I was thinking about the pigeon...
that hung around the garage, how it used to get on top of your car.
Oh, yeah, I remember.
I remember how scared I got
that wsssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap
every time I started the car.
that was the closest we came to having a pet.
buck tried to talk you into getting a dog.
he said, ""If it's the size of a football? "
you know, that animal next door...
that Pepper or Pippin
he's not friendly...
whatever Mr. McGreary says.
he wanted the retriever.
each time that dog comes here, I try to get him out.
Arf!
Arf! Arf!
put that on if you're staying out here.
can I help?
with this?
no.
I will.
you can go to your room...
and clean the closet.
mom.
okay?
because it's really a mess.
hello.
Oh, hi.
I didn't get there.
how did it go?
no, I'm not doing anything.
just getting dinner ready.
Uh-huh.
did she really?
Mary Ann Ramon started just to scream, right?
we got so drunk, we couldn't talk.
it was the last day of school.
we walked out of the building.
Oh, Bucky.
no, stop!
what do you expect from her?
we just don't connect.
why not?
we just don't.
what are you thinking?
that I jack off a lot.
so what else is new?
does it help?
for a minute.
what now?
John-Boy.
who?
John-Boy on The Waltons.
Yeah. What about him?
after Buck died, Dad came to my room.
he didn't know what to say.
he put his arm around me.
we just sat there.
I remember watching his shoe, and thinking
his shoe was turned over on its side.
I was thinking, he's so uptight! It's gonna crack off.
I knew I should've felt something.
I didn't know what to feel.
on TV, they say stuff like, ""Oh, no! "
but I didn't say that...
because I didn't feel sad...
so much as
so much as what?
I kept thinking John-Boy would've said something...
about how he felt.
what would he say?
I don't know.
come on.
come on.
come on what?
don't hold back.
well, at least she's an improvement.
that's what you get...
when your partner does the hiring.
that's my fault.
I can't tell anybody...
that they're not making it.
wait a minute.
that's not the problem.
where are you?
what?
I've been losing you these days.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's okay. That's okay.
you off the track?
huh?
come on. I've known you for 20 years.
is something wrong?
how's Connie?
Connie's all right.
he is. He's okay.
it's none of my business...
but you worry too much.
you've been on the rack about him long enough.
I'm not on the rack about him.
in a year, he'll be gone.
off to Michigan or wherever he wants to go.
maybe he'll tour Europe.
who knows?
I can't argue with ""Who knows. "
I'm giving you the benefit of my experience.
Thanks.
Valerie isn't just living away from home...
she's gone.
got her own friends, her own life.
she breezes in a few days on vacations.
I don't know. Maybe girls are different.
or maybe she was too aware...
of what was happening between Nance and me.
but they leave, and that worrying's just wasted energy.
[ young Conrad ] Give me back my sweater!
hang on.
[ Bucky ] Dad, what's possession?
give it to me!
it's already on me.
whose sweater is it?
it's my sweater!
I'll give it back...
if you give me my skis.
all right.
what?
[ man ] Watch your back.
cuts are vertical.
he really meant business.
let's go.
[ conductor ] Lake Forest is next.
what do you want?
I don't know what else to do.
I'm not asking for anything.
you're kidding me.
I don't get it.
you're excused from practice...
to see some shrink;
I work with you at your convenience.
what more should I do?
nothing.
a bright kid like you.
I don't get it.
why keep messing up your life?
I don't think that quitting swimming...
will mess up my life.
okay.
okay. Now, this is it.
Yeah.
you're a big kid.
actions have consequences.
I'm not taking you back.
I won't ask you to.
what happened? You all right?
Yeah.
you quit the swim team.
Yeah.
Why?
it was a bore.
that's no reason!
what's going on?
nothing.
talk to me.
swimming's a bore, that's all.
I talked to
quit talking to people!
okay?
holy shit.
Yeah, sure.
fuck you, Jarrett.
Ooh! Ohh!
shut up.
leave it alone.
I told you, the guy's a flake.
what did your dad say? - I haven't told him.
how come?
the timing isn't right.
he sweats everything.
he'll just get worried.
can you tell your mother?
my mother?
I told you we don't connect.
what do people have in common with mothers anyway?
it's all surface junk.
you know?
clean your room, brush your teeth...
get good grades. "
I'm not feeling anything today.
I'm sorry.
no. Sorry's out.
something's on your mind.
what time is it?
never mind. There's time.
remember the contract? Control?
maybe there's some connection...
between control and lack of feeling.
I said I feel things.
when?
when?
sometimes. I don't know.
I thought you didn't like fooling around.
what do you want?
don't say, ""I don't know. "
should I make up answers?
make one up about there's no feelings there.
I have feelings.
get it together, Jarrett.
you're trying to make me mad.
are you mad?
No!
you don't like being pushed.
do something about it!
what?
no. I can't do this.
why not?
getting mad takes too much energy.
it takes more holding it back.
when I let myself feel, I feel lousy.
# I never promised you a rose garden
fuck you, Berger.
fuck you.
yeah?
that's it.
what do you feel? Do you jack off?
what do you think?
you married a fat lady...
and you fuck the daylights out of her!
sounds good to me.
little advice about feeling
don't expect it always to tickle.
do you know how to aim that?
be quiet, I have to concentrate.
be quiet.
is it in focus?
smile, smile. Okay. Good.
I want to take the three young ones.
dad, get out of there.
all right.
be quiet.
Conrad, where are you?
between your mother and father.
you're taller than your mother is!
will you be quiet?
this is beautiful.
shut up.
wonderful.
now Cal and Beth.
sure.
go on.
you can do better than that.
I want one of Connie and Beth.
let's get the three men in there.
move closer to your mother.
prize winner.
Yeah, that's great.
do it.
isn't it marvelous?
Yes, it is.
it isn't cocked.
hold it. Connie, smile.
smile.
give me the camera.
give me the camera.
I want a really good picture.
I want a shot of you three men.
not until I get you two.
give her the goddamn camera!
smile.
who's hungry? I'll make the sandwiches.
it can be saved.
that was so dumb.
I don't think he's happy in school.
have you talked to his teachers?
people don't want to be with him.
he provokes people.
well, it's an awkward age.
thank you.
maybe he needs a change.
is he eating enough?
Yes, Mother.
he'll be all right.
if you're firm with him.
I think he should go away to school.
I can't deal with him.
who'd make that decision?
I suppose this doctor he's seeing.
what sort of doctor...
would make that decision for you?
a psychiatrist.
I thought that was finished.
no.
what's his name?
jewish doctor?
I suppose he's Jewish.
maybe just German.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
did you see it happen?
no, but she did.
she saw everything.
Where's the girl now?
are you sure you can keep her safe?
of course.
new York
did you know that the first public cell phone call was made from the New York Hilton? 1973.
there's also a rumor that the Martini was invented at the Knickerbocker, but there are some people in San Francisco that would dispute that.
I feel like I should be taking notes.
you find my fascination with hotels to be peculiar, don't you?
you sharing anything personal is peculiar.
a hotel is one of the last few places where a person can retain relative anonymity.
makes it easier when disappearing foreign diplomats from their penthouses.
with any luck, Mr. Reese, we can prevent a murder, rather than the alternative.
Yeah.
you sure the threat to her is work-related?
ms. Dobrica is single, lives alone, doesn't do much social networking, and she puts in a 60-hour work week.
whatever's gonna happen, it makes sense that it would happen here.
they say a maid can tell everything about you from how you leave your room.
all sorts of things happen in hotel rooms.
Mira's job could have put her at the wrong place at the wrong time.
what about her life before coming to america?
bit of a mystery.
she came here in '99, when computer records weren't what they are today.
I put in a call to immigration services, as a prospective employer.
would that be Mr. Wren from universal heritage insurance?
you know, her shift starts in five minutes, which means that ours starts in four.
they were hiring a bellhop and a concierge.
the choice seemed obvious.
I interviewed last night, made sure that your resume would stand out.
Oh, by the way, you worked at the hotel Lutetia in Paris for two years.
you'll have access to every room with your employee key card.
I can research the guests and exploit any necessary systems from my desk.
700 guests in this hotel.
one of them is planning a murder.
where do we start?
glad you could start on such short notice.
Derek, my pleasure.
when you're on the clock, it's Mr. Fowler.
this is Bud, my head doorman.
and you are again?
John. I worked at the hotel Lutetia.
right.
your desk is right over there.
remember, always recommend our restaurant before suggesting anywhere else.
very good.
we're hosting an event for the association of aviation technology tomorrow, and most of the attendees are arriving today, so...
no excuse for standing around.
are you waiting for a written invitation?
let me help you with that.
Mr. Reese,Mira should be housekeeping on the 30th floor.
I just finished a run on 12. I'll head up.
haven't seen you since the divorce.
you working? - Yeah.
you working? - Always.
like the suit.
I'm planting the camera on her cart.
we can see exactly where she is at all times.
I didn't take your money.
I had 50 bucks in my wallet, and now I don't.
Finch, who's in room 3024?
tug brantley, CEO of the Aggro Push Energy Drink.
I'm a platinum member of this place.
do you have any idea how difficult I can make your life?
come on.
what do you want from me?
I wanna know if those lips taste like the chocolate mints you leave on my pillow.
I'm going to come back when you're not here.
are you really going to turn me down?
is there a problem here?
who invited you in?
Mr. Reese, could you try not to get fired before lunch?
being a platinum member doesn't entitle you to sexually harass our staff.
if you disagree, we can have the police sort this out.
you're lucky I don't report you to your boss.
are you all right?
I'm fine. That sort of thing happens every other week, you know.
I could have handled it.
sounds like a rough gig.
I'm John. - Mira.
so strong, handsome guy your age working as a bellhop.
must have made a wrong turn somewhere.
Yeah, I stopped counting awhile back.
well you're in for a rough gig yourself.
our brilliant manager should have staffed four bellhops.
instead, it's just you and Randy, and he takes more smoke breaks than he does luggage.
you seem to know your way around this place.
hotel management is hard work, but it's not rocket science.
speaking of which, I should get back to work.
guess I'll be seeing you around then.
Oh, I really like this girl, Finch.
I heard back from immigration services.
Mira sought asylum as a Serbian refugee, a survivor of the Kosovo war.
I thought most refugees from that war were Albanian.
most were, but both sides suffered losses.
seeing as how mira came alone, we can only assume that whatever family she had didn't make it out.
she was 16 at the time.
she's been on her own ever since.
here's a map of midtown.
that's the theater district, Columbus circle, and the beginning of the park. It's a good start.
thank you.
I managed to hack into the security network and piggyback on their feeds, allowing me access to all the hotel's cameras.
uh, excuse me. Where's the
Oh, the ladies' is around-- and the gents', the opposite.
is something wrong?
police were asking questions about our little side operation.
it got me thinking about how they knew to poke around in the first place.
it--it wasn't me.
no. You're not stupid enough to do a thing like that because you know how upset I would be if i found out it was you.
of course.
Mr. Reese, we can add hotel staff to our list of potential threats.
sir. - Welcome back to the land of the free.
getting out of rikers took longer than I anticipated.
I understand our rogue operative slipped away from you in there.
it won't happen again. I know his face now.
need you to work fast.
ever since he assaulted our d. O.D. Facility, our source has become compromised.
compromised, sir?
this man has connections to a dangerous party.
it's imperative that you find him and figure out who he works for.
wherever he goes, a mess usually follows.
all I have to do is find the right mess.
I'm sure you'll work it out, and when you're done with him, make sure no one finds him.
understood.
any available units, please respond to a 10-50 in progress at the intersection of 46th and 3rd.
Thanks.
Hey, so listen, there's something you should know.
I'm in a bit of... Trouble.
serious? - Yeah.
my mom wants to set me up with this woman who goes to her church.
well, that's pretty serious. - Yeah.
What'd you say?
that I'm seeing someone.
it could be serious.
that right?
I don't know.
have you told your son anything?
mm, I may have mentioned a thing or two, that I met a man who's nice and funny, easy on the eyes.
Taylor's happy for me, so what do you think about meeting him?
I'm cool with it.
you? - I think it might be time.
but let's talk more about it later. I gotta go.
okay. - Okay.
s. A.I. C. Moss.
didn't think i'd ever see you here again.
I'm on a matter regarding special agent Donnelly.
after he died, I took it upon myself to review his old files.
found something that might interest you.
I discovered a recommendation to make you a field agent.
Donnelly ever discuss that with you?
once or twice, yeah.
I'm ready to run it up the flagpole, but only if you're still interested.
I am. - Great.
then with your permission, we'll initiate the background check, interview friends, family, any contacts from the past ten years.
okay, whatever you need.
are you available to take a polygraph this evening?
polygraph?
standard procedure. You can take it here in the precinct.
okay, it shouldn't be a problem.
then we'll see you later. - Okay.
you really gonna go through with this?
Yeah. I guess so.
the spa's located past the elevator banks, through a glass door on your right.
you can't miss it. - Sounds great.
everything all right, Mr. Reese?
I feel like I'm back at boot camp, and we still haven't zeroed in on the threat to Mira yet.
same girl we saw before, but she's with a different guy.
the side operation Derek's running might be girls.
I made a similar observation.
detective carter should be getting back to me soon on any known solicitation activity.
look who has time to chat.
a bus just arrived full of airplane geeks.
check them in, and let's make sure they don't crowd up the common areas.
Oh, I really hope Derek's the threat.
detective Carter.
I checked with vice.
they picked up a working girl a few days ago at that hotel off an anonymous tip, but the girl didn't say boo, and her bail was posted within an hour.
by whom? - By a guy named Bud Garrison.
our floor manager's pet.
thank you.
anything else?
should there be?
I just assume you heard my conversation with Moss.
I hear everything, detective.
so you know he thinks I'm qualified to join the feds.
well, what do you think?
I just think it'll be a great opportunity, assuming I get in.
you're concerned about the polygraph.
considering I've been lying about you guys for over a year, a little.
you know, polygraphs don't detect lies, just physiological responses.
try lying on one of the baseline questions, it might trick the test into thinking that everything you say is normal.
Yeah, it's just a machine, right?
I mean, how smart can it be?
exactly.
just a machine.
Oh, in the meantime, it might be wise for you to steer clear of John and myself, just for the time being.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Thanks.
looks like Derek is running an escort service.
if Mira called in the tip, he might be our threat.
the sooner we can confirm it, the sooner we can go home.
housekeeping.
sorry, we don't need service. My wife forgot to put the sign out.
no problem.
housekeeping.
I need to talk to you.
I can't now.
you know this can't wait.
Mr. Reese?
Mira's just been summoned into room 3215 by a guest.
she didn't look particularly happy to see him.
you must be exhausted, dropping bags off all day.
according to his hotel bill, Mr. Harris drinks more than he eats, and we have no way of knowing what's going on in the room because Mira left her phone on her cart.
she's three floors above you.
how late do you deliver room service?
I believe the hotel delivers room service
I'm not talking about the hotel.
I'm talking about you.
feel free to drop yourself off... Anytime.
excuse me.
I'm on the 32nd floor now.
don't try to push me, Harris.
but you need to listen to reason.
how can you expect me to agree to this?
because it's the right thing to do.
easy for you to say.
next time, damn well knock.
what are you doing here?
I was checking the minibar.
I'll save you the trouble. It's empty.
we'll talk later.
ms. Brozi, Ms. Brozi!
please reconsider.
what's your problem?
that's the second time you've walked in on me.
it's Derek, isn't it?
he has you following me around.
are you in some kind of trouble with him?
I know he's running girls out of here.
I also know you're involved.
I clean the rooms, that's my job.
I've worked too hard to get involved in some sleazy scheme.
is that why you tipped off the police?
that's none of your business.
what about the booze hound in there? I heard the yelling.
he's harmless. It was nothing.
are you sure about that, Ms. Dobrica?
or is that "Brozi"?
you know nothing about me, what I've seen, what I've been through.
I don't need help, especially from someone like you.
just stay away from me, got it?
we do have a good steakhouse here in the hotel, but...
personally, I'd recommend the Grand.
best rib eye in town. You will not be disappointed.
shall I put you down for 7: 30?
sure, thanks. - Okay.
I've been researching our guest.
Charles Harris is a freelance journalist working with a number of respected publications.
he's the kind of writer that has strong opinions about world leaders, making him persona non grata in a half dozen countries.
what's his interest in Mira?
not sure, but if he came all this way to talk to her, she might be some kind of source.
a girl who flees her country and changes her name is someone who doesn't want to be found.
but if she's hiding, who's she hiding from?
that guy in the turtleneck.
he's been sitting there since we arrived.
have you seen him move at all?
I don't believe so.
Yeah, well, he's got a clear line of sight of the front desk and the entrance.
might be waiting for somebody.
and if he's not?
then what's he still doing here?
how do you suggest we find out?
what ya readin'?
nothing, it was here when I sat down.
good. Can't stand these airplane nuts.
I mean, the pickup-- Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay, it's fine.
I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it.
who's he talking to?
pull up the downstairs feeds.
watch the man at the bar.
the man at the side entrance is taking his place.
they're spotters.
they're rotating positions to patch the gaps in their surveillance.
military recon tactic.
it's a hit squad, Finch.
at least it's safe to say that we found the real threat to Mira.
who would send a hit squad with military training to kill a hotel maid?
our spotter is headed back downstairs, Finch.
Where's Mira?
she's in the kitchen, taking a break.
well, I'm going to check out his room.
that room is registered to a Peter Krieg, checked in under a german passport.
could be a forged identity.
we need to know who sent the team.
any new information on Harris?
I see that his laptop is signed onto the hotel wi-fi.
if I can get past his firewall, I can see what kind of notes he has on Mira.
our spotter has a file on Harris.
whatever's going on, it has to do with a series of articles Harris wrote about a Serbian colonel named Rudko Petrovic.
that name sounds familiar.
I believe he's running for deputy prime minister.
Harris all but accused him of committing war crimes in Kosovo.
how does Mira fit into all this?
I think I just found out.
I'm in Harris's computer.
not only is her real last name "Brozi," but she's ethnic Albanian, not Serbian.
according to Harris's notes, Mira witnessed petrovic order the execution of her entire family.
it makes sense that she lied to immigration about her name and ethnicity, she was simply protecting herself.
and Harris found the one witness who could bring down the colonel.
they must have followed him to the hotel, hoping he would establish contact with his source.
they'll make their move on Mira as soon as they identify her.
they may already have.
what's the e. T.A. On our backup?
arriving as we speak.
always a bar.
Hi, give me a ginger ale.
Mr. Reese, all three spotters are back in their original positions.
keep an eye on them.
we'll deal with those guys after I get Mira out of here.
you just don't give up, do you?
John, the man at the side entrance is moving.
why won't you just leave me alone?
that a good enough reason?
he was going to kill me... For talking to the journalist.
he was going to kill you for knowing what Petrovic did to your family in Kosovo.
what does that make you?
just a guy at the right place at the right time.
conection lost
Mr. Reese, I've lost the connection to Harris's computer... And eyes on his floor.
you'd better get to Mr. Harris's room immediately.
stay close to me.
all right, like to start with a few basic questions.
is your name Jocelyn Carter? - Yes.
are you a member of the homicide task force in New York? - Yes.
have you ever smoked marijuana?
Yes. College.
you're the first one to admit that.
okay, now, we can move on to the important stuff.
Mr. Reese?
it seems that Mr. Harris remotely checked out of his room a few minutes ago.
he's not here.
any chance another maid cleaned this room?
not today. This is my floor.
you notice anything out of the ordinary?
the chair-- it's usually over there.
we're too late.
they move fast.
cleaned up best they could.
I thought he was a drunk.
yesterday, he tells me he knows who I am, that Petrovic is the man who killed my family.
how did you escape, Mira?
Sanja, a Serbian woman across the street.
I watched it happen from her attic.
then the man, Harris, found Sanja last month, made a tape of her saying I could identify the colonel.
she was found dead two weeks ago, probably from talking to the journalist.
he said if I went public, it would ensure my safety, but I refused.
look how far this monster is willing to go.
what choice do I have?
I'm gonna get you out of here, Mira, but I need to know how they found out about you.
did you tell anyone you were talking with Harris?
no, nobody.
then how could they have known you were the witness?
unless... Give me your cell phone.
the electromagnetic field of a microphone...
can interfere... With a cell phone.
they overheard everything in this room.
they're next door.
wait here.
she's running for it, Finch.
Finch, she just got on the elevator.
Mira, I was just looking for you.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid Mira's in there with another member of the hit squad.
and she has nowhere to run.
do exactly as I say.
use your key card and take us straight to the basement.
I may be able to stall the elevator before it gets to the basement, might give you a chance to get Mira out of there.
I'm a little busy, Lionel.
Yeah, one of your trained killers is leaving his post.
so is the one in the lobby.
he's taking rather a large trunk with him. I don't know what they could possibly
Oh, dear. It's Harris.
they're disposing of the body.
body? What body?
detective, you can't let them leave the hotel.
the recording, where is it?
I don't know of any recording.
the one of Sanja, your old neighbor, it wasn't in his room or on his computer.
I swear, I don't have it.
no? Too bad.
I don't know who you are, but I'm prepared to shoot you and 20 others like you to get what I came for.
glad that you're a better shot than you are a bellhop.
so am I.
detective, the barfly just left the building through the back exit.
Yeah, okay, I'm on it.
Oh, excuse me.
uh, sorry. Just looking for the bathroom.
I thought I saw a sign, but
Yeah, why don't you try right up those stairs in the lobby?
Oh, yeah. Thanks, buddy.
what do you say we get you out of here now?
not yet.
we have to get the tape Harris made of Sanja.
it's evidence Petrovic killed her.
you said you didn't have it.
I lied.
he gave me a disc to take home and watch.
thought it would persuade me to tell my story.
it's down in my locker.
well, that and your testimony would be enough to put Petrovic away.
assuming I live long enough.
I'll come back for the disc after we get you out of here.
we don't know how many hit men are left.
drop us off on the next floor, then shut this elevator down.
who are you talking to?
hello. This is Harold. I work with John.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Mira. - Sure.
Hey, excuse me, guys.
have you seen a little chihuahua?
he's a little dog about this big.
Ah, Jeez.
Yeah. - I've got a new assignment for you.
meet me at the annex south of the lobby.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm fine, by the way, considering I just took out two trained killers trying to get rid of a body.
never doubted you for a second. Now, come and meet me.
I'll be right there.
let me just call these two in.
Oh, and don't forget the guys in the storage room and the elevator.
Seriously?
got something?
big mess at the Coronet hotel.
couple guys with gunshot wounds have been tied up and gift-wrapped.
sounds like our man.
what are you still talking to me for?
this friend of yours, he's a policeman?
Yeah.
listen, Mira, he'll take you to his precinct.
it's the safest place for you until this is over.
I've never really felt safe since I left Kosovo.
I was a girl when I ran away.
new name, new country, I tried to leave all that behind.
but it's like I've just been waiting for all this to come back somehow, afraid of what would happen to me if it did.
from what I've seen, you're a lot braver than you think.
I allowed Rudko Petrovic get away with murder.
my family, Sanja, now Harris.
no more.
Petrovic must be held accountable.
you rang?
Mira, this is Lionel, and you can trust him.
nice to meet you.
all right, you ready?
thank you, John.
you're welcome.
okay, come on.
this way.
Finch, now would be a good time to tender your resignation.
have you ever lied to people you work with? - No.
have you ever knowingly associated with a wanted criminal? - No.
have you
what was that about?
how would you describe your relationship with narcotics detective Cal Beecher?
Cal? - You describe it as... Platonic?
intimate?
we see each other socially.
are you aware of any of the several i. A.B. Investigations into detective Beecher?
investigations for what?
I'm not at liberty to say.
so you were not aware of any of the ongoing investigations
no. I was not aware.
where the hell have you been?
you really have no idea what's going on in your hotel, do you?
you're me.
you find a first day employee sneaking around in the ladies' locker room.
what do you do?
I don't know, something like this?
I've got the disc.
meet you back at the library.
you're a hard man to find.
the phone please.
how about we go somewhere a little more private?
that's some line of questioning.
hope it gets easier from here.
unfortunately, this can't go any further.
I'm rescinding your offer to join the bureau.
I'm sorry, detective, sometimes these things don't work out.
why not?
I can't divulge that.
I gave you plenty of answers in that room.
I can get one from you.
in the future, I'd choose my company more wisely.
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
can i get you a soda? - I'm fine. Thank you.
okay, if you need anything, I'll be right out here, okay?
you missed all the fun.
Wonderboy and I jump-started an international incident.
shame I couldn't be there.
you say you were mugged?
Yeah, guy took my wallet and my watch.
okay.
just wait right here, sir.
someone will be by shortly to take your statement.
Thanks, buddy.
get out. Get out!
this can go one of two ways.
don't suppose one of those ways involves me walking out of here.
didn't think so.
I don't care who you are.
I don't care what you did to get here.
all I want to know is who you work for.
but that would be telling.
what makes you think I'm working for anyone, anyway?
because you're like me.
we don't give orders, we execute them.
speak for yourself.
one last time.
who do you work for?
You'll...never...know.
any deeper, and I would have cut your celiac artery.
you got about 20 minutes before you bleed to death.
you can keep coming after me, or you can get to the hospital.
I wonder if your employers would have showed you that kind of mercy.
how's it going?
fine, just tired, you know? Long day.
uh, I was thinking about what we could do with Taylor.
maybe we can go to the botanical garden saturday.
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.
maybe it is too soon, you know?
sure. - Cool.
Hey, Carter, if you need to talk to me-- I just need time.
that's it, Cal.
you take as long as you need.
I'm not going anywhere.
Hey, sarge. You have a second?
Carter, he's got a weapon!
are you okay?
guess you didn't miss all the fun after all.
Colonel's career is over.
next stop, the Hague.
I'll have what he's having.
what was your business here anyway?
well, let's just say the convention wasn't as boring as I thought it would be.
the things people try to get away with in hotels.
I see you boys made the news.
not too bad, considering you also helped to take down an escort ring.
they'd barely gotten the floor manager into handcuffs before he confessed to the entire operation.
meanwhile, my phone hasn't let up.
Councilmen needing to know that their names aren't gonna surface on the client list.
I appreciate the work.
and to make sure this place is run properly, Harold here bought the hotel.
it needed proper management.
John, Harold, this one's on the house.
ms. Brozi, I was hoping we could go over the event calendar for the month.
Absolutely.
ever consider doing in-house work?
this place could use someone in crisis management.
I like to move around.
more a freelancer, like you.
it's a nice place.
maybe I'll even stick around for one more night.
well, I heard it was all booked, but then again, you do know the owner.
the penthouse suite.
another round?
sir, I have Mr. Hersh for you.
thank you, Ms. May.
well, you haven't checked in for a while.
I hit a snag.
we have a bigger problem at home.
I need you here a. S.A. P. - I'm on my way.
ms. May, I need to draft a letter to the state department.
be right in, sir.
for your state dinner at the White House.
also, I picked up something for your anniversary.
God, I completely forgot.
ms. May, you've only worked for me for two months, and already, you know me better than I know myself.
that's what I'm here for.
ready when you are, sir.
to the Secretary of State, from office of special counsel.
we have worked too long and too hard to get this post.
we're not gonna let it slip through our fingers.
how do you know about windfall?
Oh, we have our ways.
is everything okay? -Excuse me.
would you come with us, please?
how did you learn about project windfall?
I don't need to tell you that.
actually, you do.
your knowledge and open discussion of it constitutes a breach of national security.
I'm looking for someone to spice up the airwaves.
me?
we talk about us, the army wives, and what we go through.
you are on the air.
who is she?
the magazine reporter.
I think we should separate.
let's not make any hasty decisions.
let's sleep on it. -I'm gonna stay in a hotel tonight.
I'll call you in the morning. -Let's see how you feel in the morning.
coming through. Excuse me.
Hey, pick a side and drive.
Hey, baby.
you must be from Tennessee, 'cause you the only ten I see.
sweet. You can count.
just don't breed. Excuse me.
so where's Denise?
at the hospital, working.
I've got to call her first thing in the morning with the full report.
so what's this week's tribal meeting all about?
I don't know. Roland just said to meet him here at 9: 00.
Oh, there he is.
15 minutes late.
Hey, Roland.
Hey, ladies. Sorry I'm
late, we got it.
okay, cut the suspense. What gives?
uh, where's Denise?
working.
you know, maybe this isn't the right place.
Joan and I have separated.
Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry, Roland.
when did this happen?
two days ago.
I've been staying at the Bellewind motel off the interstate.
I don't recommend it.
Why? Did she say?
uh, no.
no, this was my decision.
I thought things were getting better.
it's complicated.
you know we're here for you, right?
you are an amazing guy, and your friendship means a lot to me.
thank you.
if I can do anything
I'm not good enough for you, but he is?
excuse me?
it's okay.
look, we can handle this two ways.
you can turn around and-- ow!
No! Hey!
behind you!
Hey!
Pamela, watch out!
back off!
keep it off the bar!
why can't it ever happen in the parking lot?
Roxy, get back! -Get out!
Oh, Roxy!
is she okay?
let me take a look.
you were lucky.
the other guy was lucky.
I'd have cracked him upside the head if Pamela hadn't gotten in my way.
here.
you know, Rox, maybe it's time you stop working at the hump bar.
forget it.
I don't wanna worry about you.
you're the one deploying.
Roxy, I'm being serious.
Trevor, this was nothing.
look, when Bama played auburn, I carried a taser.
okay, who is gonna look out for the boys when I'm gone?
me and Pamela and some of the moms are splitting up kid duty.
look, I just wanna make sure everything is okay before I go.
it is okay, and I love you for making sure.
now give me those back.
the corn's colder.
I like the peas better.
unbelievable.
did I miss curfew?
I was beginning to worry.
roland needed to talk to us.
he and Joan have separated.
did you know about that?
no.
I knew that they had some problems, but I thought they were working it out.
Yeah, so did I.
how come you're home so late?
Oh, we went to a, uh, bar off-post, where Roxy works.
it's become something of a hangout for us.
a hangout?
okay, this is one of those things where the more I explain, the worse it gets.
Yes, this is one of those things.
it's really just been innocent fun until tonight
Claudia Joy, a brigadier General's wife needs to exercise a certain discretion in public.
I know, I know. Wait.
yes?
Yeah.
I got the call this evening.
public announcement's tomorrow.
Oh, Michael, I am so proud of you.
Hey, I couldn't have done this without you.
brigadier General Michael James Holden.
not yet. Not yet.
the promotion ceremony is next week. That makes it official.
but it does have a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
Yeah, it does.
at happened with General Baker?
retiring for health reasons.
and Lenore?
the army has dropped its investigation.
so they made a deal.
they had to.
this way, baker exits gracefully, and the army avoids a black eye.
did I mention I am so proud of you?
you did.
but you can mention it some more if you want.
I'm not supposed to be this way thanks for picking me up
you okay to drive?
I wasn't drunk, Joan. I was assaulted.
since when do you get into fights?
what happened?
I'm ready for this night to be over.
thank you for bailing me out, okay?
look, you're hurt.
why don't you come back home?
you don't have to stay in that hotel.
I appreciate it, but I'm checking out tomorrow.
I rented an apartment for the week.
I'll stop by in the next day or two to pick up a few things.
okay.
good night.
this is so amazing, dad.
Yes, Emmalin.
Yes, it is.
Oh, Michael.
Yeah, it's great, dad.
thank you.
girls, I appreciate your support.
look, I know that this can be a pretty demanding life, but when honors come our way, we all share in them.
does that mean we're gonna have our traditional "you did good" family dinner?
it's already in the plans, yeah.
listen, one other thing, girls.
along with this promotion comes increased responsibility.
I apologize, ladies, but your actions are gonna be under a microscope, more so now than ever.
you need to be mindful of your activities and your associations.
just use your head is all your father's saying.
congratulations, dad.
thank you, sweetie.
Yeah, congratulations, dad.
what's with her?
don't know. -Yeah.
I'm sure we'll find out sooner or later.
we have an official visit to make.
thank you so much for coming by.
I'll see you later. -Yeah.
Colonel Holden.
Hello, Lenore.
Colonel, Claudia Joy.
hello.
how kind of you to stop by.
of course.
is the general awake?
he is.
I'm sure he'll be thrilled to see you.
would give me a minute alone first?
sure.- Thanks.
well, I suppose congratulations are in order.
you won.
that's not how I look at it, Lenore.
nonsense.
an officer's life is all about competition.
don't deny it.
I was never in competition with you.
there's enough success in the world for everyone.
how noble of you.
no, it's not noble. It's a fact.
we both serve the same army, and it's a big army.
we didn't have to be rivals.
perhaps you're right, but it's quite a different view from the top.
you'll see.
how do you mean?
let's just say it's hard to know who your friends are.
in fact, it's hard to have friends at all.
I'm guessing that's gonna be quite a challenge for you, Claudia Joy, you and your--what?
colorful little assortment of friends.
but you will soon find out something's gotta give.
a little sweaty, but he's still pretty good.
Yeah. All right.
okay, that should do it.
my man knows how to work the pistons.
he's got the tools, and he knows how to use 'em.
all right. All right.
can we all come back from the seventh grade, please?
no.
thank you, sweetie. -You're welcome.
Yes. Thank you, sweetie.
you're welcome.
so I hear that radio gig's a permanent thing now.
Yep. I'm officially an unpaid employee of the U. S. Army.
Oh.
Oh, probably a fan.
more likely a collection agency.
Hello?
why, hello, soldier.
I missed you.
where is the cake?
Oh, they're at day camp.
yeah?
maybe we can pick them up together.
well, that'd be nice, but they don't get out for another hour.
an hour, huh?
Yeah, 60 whole minutes.
Amanda, we just got this from U. V. A.
you haven't signed up for orientation.
it was due last week.
I know.
you know?
honey, orientation's important.
you need to sign up for your classes.
look, mom, I've been thinking I might defer a year, not start until next fall.
what?
I'm going to go to college mom, okay?
don't worry.
this wouldn't have anything to do with Jeremy, would it?
it's--it's about life, mom, okay?
I just need some time away from school.
time?
time for what?
uh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
okay, honey everybody gets nervous about college.
I know it's scary. It's
mom, you changed your mind when you were my age.
you were gonna be a lawyer, then you married dad instead.
I was 23, not 18.
Amanda, this is a big decision, not one you make on a whim.
fill this out.
Hey.
Hi.
what is it?
it's a want ad from the post newspaper.
for what?
a bookkeeper?
you do our books.
you help Betty at the bar.
you'd be good at it.
are you high?
seriously, you cod work on post.
you could make your own hours.
Hey, you could even work from home.
you sound like a commercial, Trevor.
call now. Receive your free steak knives.
you know, we could use steak knives.
you are one of the smartest people I know.
you could do anything.
you know the difference between a lawyer and an accountant?
an accountant knows he's boring.
I'm happy where I am right now.
are you staying home now, daddy?
Yep, for a little while, anyway.
but how long?
hard to say, Luke.
that's hard to say.
if uncle Sam calls, I gotta go.
who's uncle Sam?
the man daddy works for.
I thought you worked for the army.
uncle Sam is the army, bub.
there she is that her? - Eat your ice cream before it melts.
loved Monday's show.
you just keep telling it like it is.
thank you, ladies.
show? What show?
uh, yeah, I've been meaning to get to that.
what if I told you that I have this great new job where I get pay nothing for talking about everything?
uh, I would say back up and start again, please?
you'll understand better in about three hours.
why is that?
cause that's when I go on the air.
two broken taps, four busted stools, one video poker game and then there's the A. C.Unit.
what's wrong with the A. C.
someone landed on it.
someone big, and not "cuddly" big.
you have insurance, right?
the size of my deductible,
I got better odds collecting on the video poker game.
well, we're looking at a grand here, and it's a grand I don't have.
I'll cover it.
I threw the first punch.
it's only right I pay for the damages.
no, you were defending me, and Tennessee was spoiling for a fight.
let him pay for it.
this should cover it, and I'm sorry for the trouble.
no, it is an honor to know the last real gentleman in America.
and now I'm going to the bank before I wake up.
wow, is that from the fight?
Oh, yeah, it's nothing.
how are you?
embarrassed.
to be a hero?
don't be.
it's done.
Oh, good news about Michael Holden, huh?
what news?
general Baker's retiring, so Michael's the new post commander which means no more Lenore Baker.
it should be a national holiday.
Yeah.
I gotta go, Rox.
Thanks.
see you later.
you can leave the projections on the chair.
Hello, Joan.
I heard about Michael Holden's promotion.
I assume that means you're his permanent X. O. Now.
he hasn't offered it.
but he will offer it to you.
I hope so, yes.
so you'll take it?
why do you ask?
Oh.
I see.
you want to know if I'm gonna choose our marriage over my career, is that it?
Yes, Joan.
look, if there's a chance of us having a balanced life together
then I need to turn it down?
Roland, you told me it was over.
you are staying in a hotel, and now you are asking me not to take a promotion
I haven't even been offered?
I mean, what do you want from me?
you made it very clear the other night that we don't have a marriage anymore.
sorry.
Colonel, just dropped by to offer my congratulations.
Oh, thank you.
when you have a minute.
Yes, sir.
good seeing you, Roland.
same.
all munitions were accounted for prior to transport, sir.
fine.
I understand that you and Roland have separated.
two days ago, sir.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
thank you, sir.
if you'll excuse me.
uh, Joan.
sit down, please.
I appreciate that this is a personal matter, but it is my obligation to know whatever's going on with my senior staff, especially my X. O.
every logistical detail on this post goes through your hands
troops, vehicles, munitions.
I care about you, Joan, but this isn't about friendship.
it's about duty.
if you screw up, lives could be lost.
I understand, sir.
I know I pushed you to get here, and maybe too hard.
if it isn't the right time for this position,
I can recall Lieutenant Colonel Bring.
sir, with all due respect, the challenges in my personal life will not affect my performance.
very well.
thank you, sir.
it's been so long since I've seen him.
I'm not sure how to act.
he may want to be alone at first and decompress, just don't take that personally.
I'm not even sure what to wear when I meet the plane.
he doesn't care what you're wearing, honey.
he just wants to see you.
you have any kids, Margaret?
Mm.
no, not yet, but we want to start a family soon.
good, because you will have plenty of opportunity in the next week or two.
my man just came back and got a hero's welcome.
let me tell you, he knows how to shoot off the fireworks.
we're talking 21-gun salute, so stay hydrated.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, Joan. - Hey, Denise.
I almost didn't recognize you.
well, you know, um, masquerading as a civilian.
well, you look good. - Thank you.
um, good to see you. - Yeah, nice seeing you.
uh, how's major Sherwood?
uh, he's on notice. Expected to deploy this week.
Mm.
how are you doing?
I'm okay.
well, I heard about the separation.
I'm sorry. That must be hard.
Yeah.
look, I hope I'm not stepping out of line here, but are you really okay?
you guys are friends. We really shouldn't be talking about this.
Yeah, I understand.
um, you just seem like you need a friend.
thank you.
I haven't had a female friend since, uh...college.
it's either Rolandor the guys I serve with.
well, you're in a unique position.
it can't be easy.
I just hope that you guys can work through this.
I mean, every marriage has its rough spots.
Yeah, I know, but, um, some things, once they happen, you know, they're--they're hard to get past.
I should go.
good to see you. - Yeah.
Bye. - Bye.
you wanted to talk? - I did.
I will admit, it's not easy for me seeing you grow up, Amanda.
I still remember you riding on my shoulders.
daddy.
what?
whatever you want to say, just say it, please.
your mother told me about your plan to skip college this fall.
it's not a plan. It's a possibility.
okay, "possibility." Whatever it is, I don't like it.
you worked hard to get in, Amanda.
you should go.
but... I recognize that I can't force you.
thank you.
but if you don't go, I will expect you to work.
you're gonna have to cover clothing, gas, personal expenses.
I will not support you merely hanging out at home.
is that it?
Yeah.
you don't want to say anything?
what is there to say?
okay...
What'd I miss?
I liked it better when she argued.
mommy's home!
and I got dinner. - yay, dinner! Mom's here.
Hey, go get plates.
did you listen to the show?
uh, I did. Yeah, I listened.
And?
I want the chicken leg. - I call the drumstick.
what?
"shooting off fireworks"?
I can't believe you said that, Pamela.
come on. It was a joke.
well, yeah, it's not a joke when you talk about our sex life on the radio.
I mean, it seemed like I'm just here to service you.
well, aren't you?
what we do in private is private.
okay?
the guys in delta are gonna have a field day with this.
look at me. Look at me.
you humiliated me.
think about it.
would you like me talking about you like that on the radio?
okay, Mr. Plan-for-the-future, I took your advice.
yeah?
Ta-da!
what's that?
that is Roxy's bar and grill.
it doesn't look like much, I know, but with a little paint, a little sweat, she'll clean up rele nice.
you are out of your mind, you know that?
so you tell me, but look, my mama had one.
that's how she got Marda's bar and hair salon.
so from now on, I'm gonna take 10% of my tips and put 'em in that jar for a down payment.
then we can get a loan on the rest, and I have you to thank for reminding me to be responsible for my dreams.
Yeah.
what is it?
wow, it's--it's great, Rox.
But?
the army is my job.
I thought you understood that.
I do. We wouldn't buy it until after you finish your term.
tour. - Whatever.
okay, Rox, there is always gonna be another tour.
what do you mean?
I mean we're always gonna be moving, every two or three years, wherever the tour is.
I mean, we can be in Louisiana, Korea, Germany.
look, the point is, we're never gonna beany where long enough for you to settle down and open up a bar.
I thought you understood that.
no.
guess I didn't.
I mean, I knew the army would be our whole life for a while.
I just didn't think it would be forever.
well, he's a career guy.
I can't believe you didn't have that conversation before you got married.
sorry. I forgot who I was talking to.
so when you married Chase, you knew that this was it?
Oh, yeah, but you never really know until you're in it.
something wrong?
it's stupid, uh, but chase didn't like my radio show yesterday.
you mean the "21-gun salute"?
Yeah. Yeah.
so what are you gonna do?
well, it's not exactly like
I can go on the air and apologize, so I don't know.
that's what I mean, Rox.
kind of hard to keep your identity here.
Hey, Roland.
you didn't return my call.
Oh, sorry. Busy day.
no problem. I was just free for lunch.
no, I should--I should get home.
Hey.
is something wrong?
I talked to Joan the other day, and...
look, I don't really want to get in the middle of this, but she was hurt.
did she say anything?
she didn't have to. You could just tell.
um...
Roland, she said something happened, and I gotta tell you, it--it sounded like she meant an affair.
it was a one time thing.
Why?
I've been asking myself that same question.
Roland, god.
you're my friend, and I support you, but you cheated on your wife.
I know.
it's been all of us and you...
and...
and now I'm just another man.
um, yeah, for the centerpieces, let's stay simple.
tulips and Gerber daisies
and not so tall that people can't see over them.
my, my. Planning your husband's promotion ceremony already?
you certainly don't waste the "21-gun salute"?
I stopped by to put this in your box, but since you're here...
it's just a few tips, like how I knew General Grayson loves pralines.
Oh, great.
how thoughtful of you.
general Hartnett's wife did the same for me when I took over.
well...
I've got a thousand things to do.
I know we've had our differences, Claudia Joy.
Yes, we have.
but look at you.
you're beautiful, well-educated...
it just seems like everything comes so easily for you.
that's not necessarily true.
Oh, come on.
some of us just aren't as privileged as others.
I have had to work hard for everything I've gotten in my life.
you've achieved a lot, Lenore.
I mean that.
I just hope now that you're retiring, you can enjoy it.
Oh, I'm not retiring, dear.
general Baker is the one who's quitting, not me.
I don't understand.
we're getting a divorce.
Oh.
I'm--I'm so sorry.
don't be.
he never appreciated anything I did for him anyway.
I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.
so, um, better run.
good-bye, Lenore.
surely, you know there are no good-byes in the army.
that should do it for the day.
thank you, sir.
Colonel Burton.
that's not possible.
no, I'll handle it. I'll be right there.
here you go.
detail, double time going to the crew chief.
Yes, sir.
give me a hand.
captain Bright? Lieutenant Colonel Burton.
what's wrong with the vehicles?
they're supposed to be up-armor Humvees.
well, they're not, and you signed off on the order.
let me see that.
all right, my mistake.
options?
we have to cancel the flight.
wrong, we can't do that. Ma'am, we don't have
how much time do we have?
six hours till wheels up.
I can get you the right vehicles here within the hour.
we need 12 hours turn around. You know that, colonel.
captain, it is vital that we get this equipment to Baghdad international.
now we're gonna have to work together to make that happen.
I'm gonna get on the horn to motor T.
I'm gonna be with you every step of the way until we're loaded.
you got that?
Yes, ma'am.
good
okay, let's get moving.
Hey, the kids are at Roxy's.
I thought I would take you to dinner and make up for going on the air and telling the world that you are my sex machine.
I'm the one who's sorry.
here. Here you go.
okay, what's gotten into you?
well, I was embarrassed, and I, uh, overreacted a little.
and I'm suspicious.
okay, all right, I'll give you that, but, look.
I went to work today, and I had no idea that so many people listened to your show.
And?
well, let's just say I'm now known as the "big man" on post.
wait a minute.
your delta buddies listen to the show?
Yeah.
they said they secretly learn about their women from you.
okay, so now it's okay because I gave you props in the man department?
does that make me shallow?
Yeah, I think so.
well, in that case, there's only one thing you gotta do.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Mm-hmm. Live up to the hype.
I... saw your car in the driveway.
Yeah, I'm just here to pick up a few things.
is this a good time to talk or do you still need space?
I'm just trying to figure things out.
by yourself, Roland?
I need you to have some patience, Joan.
I did when I waited two years for you to get home.
Yeah, but you couldn't wait 30 days while I was in treatment.
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.
Roland, I made a huge mistake at work today because I can't concentrate.
I'm too worried about what's gonna happen with us.
look...
can't we make this work?
when we got married, I put my life on hold for you.
and now I need to start doing the things that I had in mind for my life.
I understand that, but what do you wanna do that we can't do together?
I told you, I want to settle down and have a family.
now if you take this promotion, you know we can't do that.
that is so unfair, Roland.
you know what an opportunity this is for me.
and I want you to take it, Joan. I do.
you earned it, but is it unfair for me to want to be a father?
or to want my wife to be a mother?
I'm tired, Joan.
I'm tired of fighting.
I'm tired of fighting, too, Roland.
let's just call this what it is.
it's not a separation.
it's a divorce.
kids are sleeping late for once.
I'm sorry.
I just assumed you knew how I felt and I was wrong, but we're a family, and we need to make these decisions together.
does that mean you won't be in the army forever?
we'll have to see.
and I rise and fall again here's what I do know.
whatever the future is,
I want it to be with you.
when I'm overseas, this is what I'm gonna be remembering this moment.
right here right now.
mom, dad.
what is it?
Amanda's not in her room.
what? - Where is she?
I don't know where, but her makeup and her toothbrush are gone.
did you know about this?
no, I swear.
no messages. She'll call. I'll call her friends, see if they know anything.
this is the last thing I need right now.
I know. I'm calling Fort Benning.
if she's seeing Jeremy, I want to know about it.
Emmalin, not a word of this to anyone, you understand?
Yes, dad. - All right.
Wow. The place looks good as new.
Yeah, thanks to your friend.
oncologist, St. Luke's, M. R. I. S.?
what's this all about?
the doctor found a lump last week, and they took a biopsy, and it wasn't pretty.
you didn't tell me about that.
well, it's no big deal until it's a big deal.
now it's a big deal.
what are you gonna do?
die, probably.
nobody gets out alive, kid.
well, aren't you gonna fight it?
I would, but...I don't have any money.
I don't have any insurance, and we're talking thousands here for surgery and chemo.
I'm so sorry.
do me a favor.
name it.
go take care of table number three over there, okay?
sir.
I understand there was a little excitement at the air field last night.
minor snafu. All taken care of, sir.
good.
look, I can only imagine how painful it is separating from your husband.
I'm ready to commit if the job were offered, sir.
well...
welcome aboard.
thank you, sir.
we could put, uh, Major Masello at table three with Captain Richards.
uh, not a good idea.
what? Why?
charity golf tournament
the Major's wife called the Captain's wife a "balding clown..."mm.
and then the flying bagels appeared.
okay, fine. Uh, we'll put the Masellos at table six.
that should do it. - Are you okay?
Oh, why do you ask?
well, the flying bagels deserved some sort of response.
Amanda's gone.
she went to see Jeremyat Fort Benning.
are you sure?
Yes, Michael had Jeremy's battalion commander call us as soon as she arrived.
I'm sorry. I know this is a lot.
for both of us, it is.
that's not all, Denise.
what is it?
Lenore Baker told me something before she left.
don't listen to her.
she said it's hard to know who to trust when you're the commander's wife.
well, we knew you before you were the commander's wife, so you know you can trust us.
all right, Masellos at six.
Burton? With us up here at one.
um, yeah, probably next to us.
Dr. Samuels, thank you for calling me back, sir.
listen, I've been thinking about your offer, and I'm very much interested.
uh, no, Thursday's fine, provided I can get a flight to Chicago.
great. I'll e-mail to confirm.
Yes, sir, I think a position at northwestern could be exactly what I'm looking for.
Oh, no. I am grateful for the opportunity.
thank you.
I wonder what reservation they let him off of?
my truck's overheating.
it's 30 miles to the next station. I need some water.
maybe you should've stolen a better truck. Tonto.
you've got a big mouth. Convict. - He's only joking. Chief.
could i have some water? - You mean firewater. Tonto?
Jesus christ. Hold it!

what difference does it make? I make you feel good.
what do you want from a guy? - You make me mad.
I don't have time for this. I've got to go to work.
you really are hopeless. - That's what i always say.
call me later. - You want me to? Good.
thanks for the coffee. - Here. Take this.
you know what the man said:
the coldest winter i ever spent. Was the summer i was in san francisco.
we aren't going by the store again. We need to save a little bit.
I liked that carpet. - We can't afford it.
I know we can't afford it. But i'd like it.
you want me to go out and steal for the money?
surprise. Luther. - You were locked up.
I want the money that reggie hid. - What are you talking about?
you want that indian to snap her neck?
we were partners. - Billy. Break it.

if you mess with us. I'll put holes in her you never even thought of.
ganz. Please. - Don't fuck up.
Rosie!
Hey. Algren. Need any back up? - No. You make me nervous.
your wife makes you nervous. The radio said you had something on.
a guy named polson had his credit cards lifted.
one of polson's cards rented that green coupe over there.
it's just a laugher?
it was a kid with a switchblade.
well. You guys are experts. - We don't need any big artillery.
I'm just trying to help out. I love to watch pros work.
I don't need your help. - You can come in.
stake out the lobby. How's the car running?
how's the wife? - Mean as a snake.
you guys were in last week. I'm not supposed to be hassled.
we just want to search a room. - Not unless you've got a warrant.
you should've been a lawyer. - What the shit is this?
we're looking for a mr polson. - Room 27.
okay. Get it over with. - Is he alone?
a couple of girls went up.
you guys be careful. - And you stake out the lobby.
I'll let you handle it. Al. - Thank you.
this isn't exactly my life's ambition.
it's a part-time thing. I've got a kid who's staying with his granny.
you don't want to hear personal stuff. Are you listening to me?
did you hear a goddamn word i said?
how much money have you got left?
Hi. Liz. It's me. What's going on?
nothing. Just a couple of cops. How was your date?
you've got to stop sitting still for that kind of shit.
ask who it is. Right?
who is it? - Police. Open up.
open up. Right now. - Keep stalling.
hang on. I've got to put something on.
when i tell you to jump. You jump.
call for help now!
operator?
Jack. There are two of them.
stay here.
operator... - drop the phone. Lady.
let me go.
Billy. Bring her out. He ain't going to shoot.
come on.
shut up.
my god!
No!
you. Toss me that piece. And he won't waste him.
Jack. Don't give them the gun. Don't do it!
don't do that for me.
get the car.
nice gun.
what happened? - Read the report.
two cops get blown away by a credit card booster?
those guys were good cops. - They fucked up.
that's what you say. That's what you always say.
we're always fucking up. - The truth hurts.
it don't figure. - Can i borrow a piece?
when somebody steals your gun you usually file a report.
two cops died because you fucked up.
that isn't going to bring them back.
cates. I want to see you right away. Do you read me?
I hear you. Your voice carries. Five minutes.
there's a lot of people getting shot with 44s lately.
people must be getting mad about something.
you're an accessory to murder. - Give me a break.
his real name is albert ganz.
he's from back east. But did an armed robbery out here.
he broke out of prison a couple of days ago.
a real animal. Read this.
did he give you a return match. Or didn't he like the merchandise?
fuck you. - I'll take a rain check.
this is from the first weapon ganz used.
it's a perfect match. But it's not from the walden hotel.
it was fired six hours earlier. We found him on a park bench.
there are some bad people out there.
if there weren't. What the hell would we have to do?
he took me down. Then he put on the tv. Then you people arrived.
that's it. But i think he's going to give you guys a hard time.
he likes shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.
this is his stuff from the hotel. The big guy's room was empty.
a speedloader. This guy's got a 44 like yours.
he's serious about his artillery. - Here's the files.
Billy bear. - He's worked with ganz before.
who's this guy? - Henry wong. He worked with them.
Kehoe. Come here. I want to show you something.
tell me. Same guy? - Dick fucking tracy.
any of these guys still around? - One of them is in the slammer.
get in here. Cates. - Yeah!
goddamn speedloader! Kehoe.
I want to be left alone on this one.
there's an official department policy about cop killings.
any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a great danger to civilians.
we can't seem like we're in the revenge business.
what's bothering you?
it bothers me when cops get killed.
you might be more of a team player on this one. Hot dog.
hotdogging has been working real well so far. I've got a lead.
you can do things your own way.
you nail this guy and make us all look good.
but if you screw up. You're going down.
you know how to send a guy out with a real great attitude.
I'm here to see reggie hammond. - He's in 18.
you want company? - No. Thank you.
you don't have to sell your body to the night roxanne you don't have to put on the red light you walk the streets for money don't care if it's wrong or right roxanne!
is that hammond?
Hammond. - Put on the red light!
put on the red light! - Hammond!
have you got a name. Cop? - Cates. I want to talk to you in private.
you're single. No fixed address. No relatives.
one conviction. Armed robbery. Six months to go.
are you writing my life story? - Not likely.
I just need a little help.
it's henry wong. An old friend of mine. He's looked better.
I've been in that cell for 21/2 years. I'm getting out in 6 months.
you've come to the wrong person. I don't fuck my old friends over.
that's too bad. I thought maybe you were a smart boy.
I guess if you were real smart. You wouldn't be a convict.
a second-rater like you would be no help against ganz.
ganz will be in jail for two years after i get out.
it didn't work out that way. A big indian busted him out.
cates. - Yeah?
I can help you get ganz if you get me out of here first.
to get him i've got to be on the street.
I want ganz as bad as you. And we've got no time.
bullshit. - I'm serious.
get me out of here. - I'll think about it. Reggie.
Cates!
you've got to get me out of here. Man!
Cates!
fuck you!
let me borrow your pen. Bob. - Are you using your own name?
shit. No.
if all this comes down. I'm not going to burn for you.
and if it comes down. Your ass is new-mown grass.
you've got him for 48 hours. - Sure thing.
you've got a big career ahead of you as a forger.
Hammond. - Okay. Send him through.
you've got to sign him. He's all yours.
you need me more than you thought. - That shows you how desperate i am.
is that suit prison issue? - $957. i wore this shit in.
maybe we can get you dressed and go on a pussy hunt.
I've already got that department taken care of.
you've got a lady? The generosity of women never ceases to amaze me.
I don't work like this. No deal.
we have no deal. I own your ass. - What a way to start a partnership.
we ain't partners. Brothers. Or friends.
I'm keeping you until ganz is locked up or dead.
if ganz gets away. You're going to be sorry you ever met me.
I'm already sorry.
this is your car? It looks like you bought it from a brother.
I got you out. Where are we going?
we've got to see a guy called luther.
is luther part of the gang? - What gang. Jack?
I can read a police file. Shithead. And quit calling me jack.
it's better than shithead. - I may call you worse than that.
right up there. But he isn't expecting company.
Luther isn't very stable. I don't want you getting shot.
right there. 232.
what are the chances he's packed? - 100%.
you'd better leave me a gun.
sure thing. Asshole. You just hang on.
I hope this big move of yours turns out to be something.
what's happening. Luther? Did that hurt? It looked real painful.
Luther. I'm talking to you.
Hammond. Drop that gun. - Don't point that gun at me.
don't point your gun at me! - Hand me that gun.
I'm looking for ganz. - I haven't seen him for years.
you just took a shot at me. I think you know where ganz is.
who gives a fuck what you think?
you better tell this boy something. He's having a ball with this door.
Luther. Are you angry with me?
what are you smiling at? Your big move turned out to be shit.
I was defending myself.
I want to make a citizen's arrest. - Shut up!
what have you got there. Jack? - Carrying a concealed weapon.
resisting arrest. I'll think up some more tomorrow.
I bet you will. - Get him out of here.
Bye. Luther. - Fuck you. Reggie.
I want a lawyer.
you stay right here... okay?
get your hands off me.
you ladies look like you need some assistance.
we don't need some court-appointed lawyer trying to bullshit us.
the city is coming down on people involved with vice.
Hello? - Jack cates. Any messages?
some lady called to say she still wants her occasional roommate.
she'd like to talk it over tonight after work.
look. Elaine. I don't know when i'll be able to come by.
I'm working too hard at this.
I'm not happy about it. I've got a few things to take care of.
this is not the way people who care about each other behave.
shit!
you're both going to do a little time. 30 days each...
...unless we talk some real business.
we can go in this room. - Let's go.
I was about to get some trim. - We're not on a trim hunt.
my stomach is starting to growl. - We eat when i say we eat.
I want some food now. If you don't like it. Take me back to jail.
you've been treating me like shit. I want to eat in a nice place.
hold it. I'm hungry. Let's go get something to eat.
I want mandolins and violins...
here... there's your goddamn dinner.
come on.
who was that on the phone? - None of your business.
keep your mouth shut. - I think it was your lady.
what's her problem? - The same as half the population.
she can't get the job she wants. It pisses her off.
what do you care? - I'm in jail.
I was surrounded by guys in blue suits 24 hours a day.
the clothes you wear. You look like you'd love it.
where to. Convict? - Mission district. Indian hangout.
tell me about your girlfriend. - I don't give out details.
I've been in prison. I'm tired of hearing lies about pussy.
was it last week? - Last night.
was it fun? - Yeah...
in the morning we got in a fucking argument.
at least you took care of business first.
does she have big titties?
I can see this is going to be a long night. Convict.
what's the deal? - Billy used to work at this club.
I heard him talk about it. - This is a bad neighbourhood.
you just back me up. Pretend like you've got a piece.
they may beat me up. But they'd kill you.
it's amazing how far a gun and a badge will take some guys.
a bullshit attitude and experience is what gets you through.
white cops used to fuck with me and my friends.
they just flash their badges. - Experience is what counts.
you want to bet? - Two problems.
I ain't playing games. And you've got nothing to bet with.
if we get any kind of lead. Turn your back and let me get some pussy.
any man who talks about women like you. Can't get it up anyhow.
I've been in prison for three years. My dick gets hard if the wind blows.
it's a bet. But when you lose. You tell me the truth.
what is ganz after? - What are you talking about?
fuck you! The bet's off.
all right. Iook...
if i lose. I'll tell you everything you want to know.
you've got a deal. Hell. I might even give you my badge.
bullshit and experience is all it takes.
come on and experience some of my bullshit.
not a popular place with the brothers.
I always liked country boys. They'll sure as hell like you.
Howdy.
how do? - Yeah?
I'd like something to drink. Vodka.
how about a black russian?
black russian. That's a funny joke.
I'm black. But i'd rather have plain old vodka.
as we're standing here talking.
I wonder if you know where i could find billy bear?
never heard of him. - Never heard of billy bear?
look here...
you heard of him now? - What are you talking about?
I'll look around for a while. - I don't give a shit what you do.
good.
I've never seen so many backward-ass country fucks in my life.
you look like regulars. I'm looking for billy bear.
this is our place. Nigger.
you're a big. Tough. Country faggot.
are you out of your mind? Get up against that pole.
do you think i'm playing a goddamn game?
this is a police matter. I'm looking for an indian named billy bear.
I know everybody in here wants to cooperate with me.
that's not even necessary. I've got the situation in hand.
some of us citizens are behind you all the way. Officer.
what's you problem? - I'm on parole.
sit your country ass down.
listen up.
I don't like white people. I hate rednecks.
you people are rednecks. I'm enjoying this shit.
you're loaded here. - Tax refund.
bullshit! You're too stupid to have a job.
you don't like that? You hate that shit. Right?
what kind of cop are you? - I'm your worst nightmare.
I'm a nigger with a badge. I can kick your ass whenever i like.
one of them was underage. Another attacked a police officer.
you're going out of business.
let's see what we can fuck with next.
okay. Listen... the indian hangs out with a chick up the block.
Chinatown. She lives on top of the jewellery store.
I didn't ask about the girl. - You'll have to settle for that.
that's all i know.
look. Hoss. You start running a respectable business
and i won't have to come in here and hassle you every night.
the rest of you cowboys should know that there's a new sheriff in town.
his name is reggie hammond. You all be cool.
how's it going? - You've got something for me.
what are you talking about? - The gun you took off the redneck.
you saw that? - Yeah.
there you go. - And the switchblade.
you don't miss anything. Jack.
it was real smooth how i took it.
you owe me a piece of ass. Give me the gun. We'll call it even.
you did a good job. Reggie. You deserve a reward.
here.
fucking bastard. - That i am.
Hey! Let's go get us an indian down the alley.
I don't think anybody's home.
let's check around back.
I hope we have as much fun as we had in that hillbilly bar.
did you see the way i handled those boys?
why don't you get a megaphone and announce we're coming?
what the hell are they watching? - I don't know.
TV has changed. Get this.
that must be billy's girlfriend.
police. Nobody move. - Stay where you are.
drop it. Or he gets another one. - This girl thinks she's babe ruth.
police. Put the goddamn gun down. - Don't give me that police shit.
look. Don't shoot.
I'm just going to reach for my badge.
I've seen fake badges before. - Hey. Sweetheart...
listen up. This guy's one nervous cop.
shut up! I'm the calm type.
I know you don't want me to shoot you.
just hand me over the gun.
you assholes better be real. - Hey. Let's see your badge.
I don't have a badge. - Call the cops.
put that phone down. You're both going to answer some questions.
all right... which one of you sees billy bear?
the son of a bitch isn't here and he's not coming back.
you can do better than that. - He hasn't been here for two weeks.
it sounds like a stormy romance.
Yeah. I went a couple of laps around the track with him.
wait. I've been in prison for three years.
maybe these ladies would like to go around the track with us.
fuck off. - Come on.
if you find billy. Tell him to stay out of my life.
let's go.
this sucks!
a maniac gets hold of my gun and starts killing people with it.
I ought to be at home in bed with my girl.
not out on the streets with a charcoal-coloured loser.
just leave. I can take care of ganz by myself.
you can't take care of shit.
you've been dicking me around since we started.
you've given me nothing. - I'm impressed with you. Too.
kicking in the door on a couple of dikes.
either luther or you has to tell me what the fuck this is all about.
you got 48 hours. The clock's running.
I don't like the way you ask me. - Who gives a damn?
you're just a crook on a weekend pass.
you're just a spear-chucker with a prison number.
I'm through fucking around.
tell me the truth or i'll beat the shit out of you.
you're going to kick my ass? You've lost your mind.
I'm not in the mood.
it's going to be embarrassing for you and the police force.
look. Nigger. I fight dirty.
you little fucker!
don't put me in the fucking garbage! Get the fuck off!
what's going on here? - Nothing.
it's all right. I'm a cop. - Get your hands up.
I'm too fucking tired. My gun and badge are in the car.
check it out. Bill. Get in the car.
what the hell is going on?
two women called and said a couple of hoods broke in to their place.
we rousted them. You can straighten it out.
why don't you do it yourself? We've got better things to do.
I'll file a report tomorrow. - I'll file a report tonight.
it goes with the territory.
it's good your friends came. - You want to try it again?
you'd call your buddies back. - They saved your ass.
that's what you'll tell them. - I'll put it in my report.
I bet you will.
how much do i owe you? - Ten bucks.
mother fucker!
you come clean or we're going again. Right here and now.
I want to know what's going on between you and ganz.
I've been waiting for some money for a long time... $1/2 million.
are you starting to get the picture?
tell me about the money.
me and some friends hit a dealer during a sale.
it's the kind of money nobody reports stolen.
one of the guys dropped dime on me. He now has your gun.
he's after your money? - You're a real bright cop.
how much do you want? Do you want to split it 50-50?
not likely. Convict. - I can't have any of it?
I believe in the merit system. Boy.
I'll be real good from now on. - Where's the money?
in the trunk of my car.
right. Partner.
but get this: We ain't brothers. Partners or friends.
if ganz gets away with my money. You'll be sorry you ever met me.
Where's the goddamn car? - Be cool. The car's parked.
for three years? Bullshit! - Bullshit?
I'll let you in on a little secret. You just passed it.
now what? - Now you get to play cop.
watch that building while i have a sleep.
you son of a bitch! You knew where the money was all along.
I almost got my ass shot off. - Being a cop is a hard job.
the garage opens at seven o'clock. Wake me up at a quarter to.
Jack. Tell me a story.
fuck you! - That's one of my favourites.
Yeah. Yeah...
you're sleeping on the job. - They open in five minutes.
go look for ganz. - You took a chance leaving it here.
I knew ganz was away. I knew luther wouldn't cross me.
Lutherjust crossed the street.
the guy took a shot at a cop and is back out on the street.
the judicial system is shit.
I want to pick up my car. - What's the name?
Reggie hammond.
this is three years old. - Yeah. I've been busy!
al. Bring out 29-012. It's been here three years.
charge the battery. - We do that every month.
thanks a lot.
there he is.
look at all the dust on my car. He should take it to a car wash.
I didn't know darker people went in for foreign jobs.
some white asshole had just bought the last shitty sky-blue cadillac.
I hope none of my fellas sees me riding around in this car.
I don't care how it looks. - It has no class.
class isn't something you buy. Look at you in that $500 suit.
is that suit yours? - They used to be in style.
if you switch from armed robbery to pimping. You're all set.
that's the money.
look out!
Hey. Put that down.
Luther!
I'm going after the money.
come on. Stay close.
freeze. - I'm a cop.
meet me at vroman's. And bring the shit. Thank you.
vodka with a twist. And i'd like to run up a tab.
Hey. Baby. I'm reggie hammond. - So what?
Hey. My name's reggie hammond. - I'm with somebody.
how you doing? My name's reggie hammond.
this ain't my night.
you look awful. - Yeah? Well. So do you.
from what i've heard. You've lost ganz for the second time.
and some soul brother beat the crap out of you.
did any calls come in? - Nothing.
Kehoe. Ordnance.
your reports are late, cates. - They'll be in tomorrow.
you can depend on it. Bullshit.
I'm heading out. - I've got to wait for a call.
you really ought to get some rest.
Yeah. He's here. Cates. For you. Line three.
motherfucker. Where are you? - I'm at work. Asshole.
Elaine. I'm sorry. I thought it was somebody else. Police business.
no wonder you're so popular. - I'm sorry about all this.
Jack. - Jack?
I almost forgot. Your pal from the vice squad phoned.
you rousted a bar with him last night. - Why didn't you tell me?
what's the goddamn number? - It's on my desk.
I've got to put you on hold. - Don't put me on hold.
you son of a bitch.
it's under the light.
Reggie hammond. - Where are you?
I've been waiting for you to call.
I'm at vroman's in the filmore.
I know you don't know the place. The brothers hang out here.
I'll be right there. Don't move your ass.
Elaine's on the other line. - Jesus!
Elaine? - Jack... fuck you!
shit.
my name is reggie. - I'm candy.
look. If i don't get some trim tonight. I'm going to bust.
you know. Sex. - Can't you ask me better than that?
it's 10: 05. by 10: 10. I want to be into some flesh.
let's go across the street... i don't have any money.
you can't even pay for the room?
Jack. I want you to meet my friend candy.
hello. - And goodbye.
maybe i'll see you later. - I hope so. You're so rude.
Where's luther? - Where's ganz?
you missed him. Luther took a cab to the hotel across the street.
maybe we should pay him a visit. - It makes no sense.
there's a do not disturb sign on his door. We'll see him tomorrow.
that way we'll catch ganz. - Why don't you just take the money?
I could have done that. But i want ganz as much as you do.
I'll let you in on a secret...
keep it. I'm too tired to argue about that.
thanks for calling.
calling you a nigger. I didn't mean that stuff.
I was just doing my job and keeping you down.
doing yourjob don't explain everything. Jack.
as long as you're being abe lincoln. You see that girl?
she'd love to take me to a hotel and fuck my brains out.
I need the money for a room. - I've got...
20. - That should be fine.
have fun. - I'll have sex. Jack.
you come here often? - This is my favourite place.
this is my wife. Are you whispering in my wife's ear?
I've got rent money for one night.
lack of pussy makes you brave. Man! Let's go.
where do you want to go? - Over to the hotel.
shit! Excuse me. Please.
wait a minute! - That was quick.
luther's on the move.
open your coat... both sides.
let her go. - Money first.
show me. Set it there.
Rosalie. Are you okay? - What are you talking about?
I said i wouldn't hurt her.
Goddamn! You lost a stolen bus!
five deaths are related to ganz. And you blow it for a nigger convict.
I called him a nigger. You bet i did.
that piece of shit hasn't spent one legal day in his life.
this is it for you. Suspension. Review board.
you're protecting a con! - Goddamn it!
this man has got more brains than you'll ever know.
he's got more guts. Too. - That don't mean shit to me!
let's get out of here.
where do you think you're going?
don't be so hard on the guy. - You go fuck yourself. Convict.
how did my car get here? - I had it impounded.
you're going back to the slammer. - Ganz got away with all my money.
now you're taking me to jail in my own car. That don't seem right.
a lot of things don't seem right.
I could use a drink. I'll buy. It'll be my goodbye present.
I feel like i let you down. - No. It was a longshot.
we gave 'em a hell of a run. - But we didn't catch 'em.
Hello? - Let me talk to kehoe.
Kehoe. Answer the damn phone. It's for you.
how's it going? - Not so good.
how about the other guys? - They're on the street.
airport? Train station? - They're clean.
they dumped the bus in chinatown. Other than that. We've got nothing.
I'll get back to you later.
nothing! No ganz. No indian.
airport's clean. Bus station. Train station. Docks... shit!
it's too bad. Our partnership ended before it got started.
some partnership.
what's up with your lady? - We had another fight. Why?
if i was depressed and had a lady. I'd go and see her.
no. I'll make it up to her tomorrow.
what about that big indian's girl? - He won't be going back there.
they found the bus down in chinatown.
maybe he's visiting his girl. - Billy's girl isn't interested.
she'll put a bullet in him. - Yeah. I'm reaching.
well. You've got important things to do. Like going back to jail.
Chinatown? - Yeah.
there she is. Jack.
what ever play i make. Back me up.
come on.
I hear you've got visitors. Don't give me any crap.
answer my questions!
you're billy's girl. You've always been his girl.
the man can live or die. It's up to you. Let us in.
otherwise he's a dead man.
he's in the room down the hall. - Where's ganz?
down the other corridor. - All right. Come on.
give it up. Billy. You've got no chance.
Billy. You're going to lose.
get down!
come on.
it's all over.
I'll kill you!
you ought to know. Reggie. If you come up against me you will lose.
there's one more little thing i've got to take care of.
Hey. Cop. Come on. I've got something for you.
you're not going to make it. - What are you talking about?
I've got your gun. I've got the money. I've got everything.
blow his fucking brains out. - Bullshit! He won't try it.
right. Cop?
are you crazy. Man? I was just bluffing.
I got hit! I don't believe it. I got shot.
you're done. End of story. - You!
I've got to go. Okay?
here's something for you. - I'm not a pro.
buy yourself something. I'm in a rush.
I've got a cop waiting for me downstairs.
I'll be back in about six months and we'll go dancing.
okay. Take care of yourself. - You. Too.
see you later.
so tell me how great you were.
I don't go in for that macho shit.
I was great. I should have my dick bronzed.
is this what you want to talk about?
I've been waiting for that money for three years.
Where's your merit-system shit now?
it's your money. It'll be there when you get out.
you don't want any of it? - It's not my style.
I need a car. Loan me a couple of thousand when you get out.
what kind of car do you want? - A convertible. I'm a rag-top man.
deal. - Good.
even if you do give me the money for a car. It don't mean shit.
if i ever hear of you crossing the line. I'll bust your ass.
both of us know that i'm going to be honest from now on.
but if i did decide to be a thief. Do you think you could catch me?
can i have my lighter back. Reggie?
Ziva, you recognize him?
Yes, I know him-- his name is Michael Rivkin. He's with the Mossad.
anything you want to tell me?
two members of the terrorist cell are dead after Rivkin paid them a visit.
do you think there is any chance Ziva...
don't ask that question. Leave it to me.
interfering? How is he interfering?
he's already killed two suspects.
well, in my country, that would be cause for celebration.
you're not in your country, and neither is he!
michael Rivkin. Guy on the left? Director of Mossad.
Ziva's father. - Your father sends his love.
what else does my father send? - Me.
how well do I know him?
well, you saw him when he was in DC three days ago.
Ziva David. She works for me.
it's to you, Hutch.
director Hutchins.
did you hear that?
can't hear anything with you splashing the pot.
Len, who's your girl on point? Foster-Yates?
Yeah.
agent Foster-Yates come in.
Yes, sir-- is there a problem?
we just heard a noise on the patio.
Foster-Yates! - I'm on my way, sir.
get back inside! Stay inside, Director.
one through four, secure the perimeter. - What the hell's going on?
five through eight, converge on SecNav's residence.
we got an agent down! - Lock down the perimeter.
secure the doors.
get an ambulance... now!
immigration Customs Enforcement.
this is turning into a circus. - Here come the clowns.
FBI does have jurisdiction in the death of a federal agent.
well, I like our chances, with Gibbs in there waving a chair like Gunther Gebel-Williams.
lion tamer. He's my second favorite hero after Steve McQueen.
sure, because riding a motorcycle looks cool and all, but...
but no one messes with a man driving an elephant.
a game of cards between the agency chiefs at the Secretary of the Navy's house.
love to be a fly on that wall.
to buzz and irritate the big bosses?
no, to eavesdrop on their conversation.
that is an invasion of privacy, McGee.
mind your backs there, please.
ladies and gentlemen, the amazing Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard, the first and only M. E.under the big top.
not to slight your penchant for theatrics, Anthony, but, uh, where is our ringmaster?
duking it out for the job with Fornell and some girl from ICE.
excuse me.
a murder investigation?
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
agent Sherman could've had a heart attack, for all we know.
medical examiner is here.
great. NCIS takes the lead, supported by FBI, I. C.E.
CIA can go home.
my house, my rules. - Good luck.
all yours.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
agent Julia Foster-Yates. So...
cards on the table.
four high-profile targets in the same room.
we were tasked with protection.
for a poker game.
we take even the simplest assignments very seriously.
not seriously enough.
looks like someone dropped a cocktail wienie.
I have a riddle for you.
what is not food, but tastes very well?
I'll give you a hint.
and you should come up with the answer before Officer David, since it's right on the...
tip of your tongue.
he bit it off.
he was flailing, losing control of his limbs.
was he poisoned?
no, I don't think so.
he has this severe bruise on his neck.
no, this man was attacked.
are you certain?
are you the one that performed CPR?
unsuccessfully.
well, it was the right instinct. This man was oxygen-deprived.
see, he has petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes.
he was strangled.
that would suggest someone penetrated our security web unseen.
and why is that so unlikely?
because I designed it. It was airtight.
apparently not.
downloaded all the footage from the surveillance cams covering the grounds.
patio's a blind spot.

SECNAV's place, ICE's people.
CIA brought the chips and dip.
the Bureau... - The booze.
little early for a drink, Jethro. - Yeah, I might need it.
to settle your gut?
something here bother you, boss?
no.
nothing here.
not here.
heads of the CIA, FBI, I. C.E.
that's a full bowl of alphabet soup, huh?
not all of them. Which letters you got on your badge, McGee?
oils from his face when he pressed against the glass.
powder is sticking. Might be adhesive.
agent DiNozzo, Officer David...
a fly.
bug.
on the wall.
boss, we found a listening device.
looks like it was stuck to the glass.
agent Sherman flails against the door.
it gets dislodged. Falls under his body.
whatever happened here...
is still happening. Is it functional?
damaged. Best not to take any chances.
No!
I mean, it's not like he left no trace behind.
he left exactly one trace. The bug.
but someone, in their infinite wisdom, decided to stomp it into a hundred pieces.
it might've still been transmitting.
it was not transmitting.
we could have tracked the signal, you know, maybe gotten a lead.
the bug stomps.
it's a classic movie move. Sounds like a Tony.
Nah, it was a Jules.
a Jules? What is a Jules?
I'm going to have to have a word with this Jules if we ever have the good fortune of meeting.
I'd like to be here for that.
what, you holding aces and eights there, McGee? Dead man's hand?
what? No, no, this is what was on the table when the game ended.
the pot's not right.
what do you mean?
well... at a quick glance, it looks like, uh, five-card draw, 50-buck ante.
ice starts the action with two bills, three callers.
SECNAV draws one to fill in an inside straight and misses-- figures.
CIA keeps the cowboys, mucks the rags, pulls a second pair.
hutch misses the flush but won't bow out.
ice is the clear leader, standing pat at the wheel.
I... I have no idea what you just said.
you got to be an idiot to still be in this hand.
are these guys not paying attention? They're not playing very well.
well, obviously not as well as you.
someone was spying on the card game.
dead agent got in the way.
in previous games, Davenport and his buddies have always threatened to play till someone dropped.
I guess we should have believed them.
you've played with them.
but not last night.
last time I played, I cleaned Hutch out. I cleaned them all out.
that's probably why they didn't invite you back.
got a hell of a poker face.
Ducky has the body.
McGee's processing the scene.
DiNozzo and David?
reviewing ICE's protection detail.
scouring the grounds with Agent Foster-Yates.
keep me updated. - Sir.
heavy footfalls on the lawn, directed towards the patio.
agents stationed at the perimeter converged on the house after Sherman went down.
they did not catch his attacker.
he did not get out this way.
unless he could cross a lawn without bending a blade of grass.
well, not impossible with the proper training.
she can also do that trick where you put your ear to a rail and you can hear a train coming.
you get this same training? - Me? No.
but I can eat a bucket of chicken in one sitting and, uh, I have X-ray vision.
complementary skill sets make for a stronger team dynamic.
I was always trying to explain that concept to Sherman.
bit of a maverick, huh?
he was a good agent.
I'm sure the two of you don't always agree on everything.
no, not everything.
healthy debate breeds, uh, creative solutions.
isn't that right, Ziva?
where did she go?
a few branches are missing up here.
a clear view of the property. He could study the patrol pattern.
they go in, he goes up, and then he goes out... that gate.
it's McGee.
Hey, Gibbs wants you guys to come back.
I'm up a tree. - Well, this might only confuse you further.
well, who said I was confused?
you said you're up a tree. - I am.
why is he calling you and not me? I'm the senior field agent.
I don't know why he's not calling you, Tony.
I did call Tony. - He's not making any sense.
and you're the one not making sense.
he said he called you.
I'm not getting a signal.
how come you're getting a sial and I'm not?
because I'm up a tree.
we solve cases all the time like this.
what did McGee have to say?
that it is time to go.
using his forearm and biceps, the attacker puts pressure on both sides of the neck, cutting off the blood supply through the carotid arteries.
here. Cradled in the crook of his arm...
the trachea and larynx remain unharmed.
Tobias, Tobi-- you, you push up on a rear choke, not down, - and you turn your chin into your shoulder. - Yeah.
after a few moments in the aptly named sleeper hold, and the victim loses consciousness.
failure to release the pressure causes a complete systematic shutdown.
the bladder and bowels release. - Hey, Duck?
Oh, continue the pressure and the result is inevitable.
death.
by asphyxiation.
Yeah, well, that's what I was anticipating but not what I discovered.
agent Sherman's medical records.
he had warning signs of atherosclerotic disease.
aggravated by the temporary deprivation of blood to the brain and...
he suffered a fatal stroke.
Yeah, but if the attacker's intent was to kill, he would have held the choke hold long enough until the lungs failed.
I'm good. - But he didn't.
attack wasn't meant to be lethal.
well, that's what I think.
so the intruder makes his way quickly through a secure perimeter, subdues the only guard he encounters silently, and leaves a listening device behind.
and vanishes.
we're dealing with a pro, which eliminates the neighbor kid retrieving a lost Frisbee.
I'll have the Bureau compile profiles.
using your X-ray vision?
black lace, matching set.
Really? On the job?
SECNAV usually has an NCIS agent tasked to guard him at all times, but ICE was assigned the detail.
ten men in total, huh?
for a poker game they were not even playing.
why don't you tell us what's really going on?
the game was just a cover. Wasn't it?
I was instructed not to reveal any details.
Oh, I think you should disregard that instruction.
four agencies filled with people who speclize in finding out information.
it was an intelligence summit.
what was the subject?
I wish I knew.
whatever it was, someone was willing to kill to find out.
intelligence summit?
seems like your classic contradiction in terms.
don't give me the look; I didn't know.
you had suspicions.
because you had suspicions. I'm riding shotgun here, Gibbs.
Yeah, can I borrow it? - Go easy, Hoss.
she was just doing what she was told.
you do not get to determine what is worth sharing and what is not.
I don't answer to you, Agent Gibbs. - Yes, you do.
yes... you... do.
what else have you left out?
perimeter!
uh, solid design, boss. Effective.
barring human error.
are you suggesting I'm incompetent or this was an inside job?
dealer's choice.
boss, you know, I could use the footage to build an animated model and recreate the movements of all the players, see if there was any possible path of entry.
all I would need is the position reports.
you got that. Help him out.
starting to doubt the invisible man theory, boss?
Backgrous.
every agent on the detail last night-- personal and professional histories.
possible suspects with the necessary skills, starting with known foreign operatives in the area.
FBI profiles.
really help narrow it down if we knew what the summit was about.
Yeah, it would. You got another one of those?
triplicate.
we need to know what they were discussing.
please come right in.
it's crucial to the investigation.
suppose it goes to motive.
Yes, it does, Mr. Secretary.
sit down, gentlemen.
first year of a new president's term, he's tested. Check your timeline.
june, July, eight years ago, Al-Qaeda showed themselves.
in flight schools where no one was interested in learning how to take off or land.
our opportunity was missed because agencies weren't in the habit of sharing information.
there've been far too many foreign nationals being far too comfortable on American soil
gun runners, terror cells, even Israeli Mossad.
you mean like Rivkin.
slipping through our borders like 9/11 never happened.
came to a head in L. A. with OSP.
Mossad's operative still hasn't been called home since then.
that's Director Eli David's not too subtle message that we're not doing a strong enough job of policing our own backyard.
the pretext of a poker game was meant to cut down on the chatter leading up to the summit, and the informal setting serves to loosen stubborn lips accustomed to secrecy.
NCIS wasn't represented. - I was there.
was one surviving member of the cell in California Haziq Khaleel?
he's in custody.
Macy and Hanna-- they conducted the interrogation.
did he spill?
Haziq gave up his handler Abin Tabal.
he gives up anything on Callen's shooter? - No.
how's Callen doing?
he's still critical.
he's hanging in there.
we got a guy on our watch list using the alias Abin Tabal
believed to be here in Washington.
chase him down.
Abin Tabal, aka Adolfo Ruiz, aka Hikmet Gillersoy, aka, like, nine other de-up names.
over the course of the last three years, he has hit the watch list with Spanish, Russian, Chechnyan, Greek, and Cypriot passports.
doesn't keep the same one very long.
the United States is the only common destination among all the passports.
under various identities, he's landed in Egypt, Algeria, Libya, and Niger.
so the guy's got a fondness for Northern Africa.
excuse me. Officer David.
shalom.
what do you think? Training center?
he's the handler.
goes back and forth between headquarters and activating sleeper cells in the States.
I'll catch Gibbs up. Find the guy.
Oh, o-okay. I like taking orders from just about anybody, I guess.
especially the guy who framed me for murder.
one minute he's framing me for murder, the next he's treating me like a perfectly capable agent.
the nerve.
I have to run out for a few minutes.
I'll be right back.
I will be right here.
full digitization would take all day.
Quick-scan the access road footage?
exactly what I was thinking, Jules.
thanks for coming to my rescue up there.
I appreciate it, Tim.
my pleasure.
are you often in the habit of destroying evidence, Jules?
beg your pardon?
you should, actually, because I'm the one responsible for reconnecting and reactivating all of those extremely delicate pieces of electronics.
you can do that? - Of course I can.
then what's the problem?
you probably know some kind of martial arts or something, huh?
when I was in high school, my mother was the ambassador to Bangkok.
I fell in love with Muay Thai.
so I tried to scratch your eyes out, you could probably break my fingers?
that would be a mistake.
you need your fingers to fix that bug.
and in my own lab.
rewind that security footage.
uh, it's the same car.
second time it's passed by.
casing the place. Can you I. D.the driver?
no, but I can pull the plate.
let's pull up the registration.
someone you know?
I got to get Gibbs.
uh, Jules, you should probably come with me.
a vehicle.
pulled off surveillance approaching SECNAV's house.
that doesn't belong to Abin Tabal.
come on, Leon, you should be able to recognize your own car.
what were you doing outside the house?
I wasn't invited inside.
I'm getting very tired of information being withheld.
I know what you mean.
curiosity can make you do some funny things.
like what?
cruise a secret meeting?
just to confirm it took place.
director Hutchins let it slip a week ago.
before he realized you were being excluded?
it's a tough town, Gibbs.
believe it or not, I'm still trying to get the hang of it.
relationships are delicate.
why weren't you invited?
because they were there to talk about me.
I wish I could stay for lunch, Michael.
that's okay. Join me for a drink.
another vodka, just a splash of soda this time, please.
uh, nothing for me, thanks.
I'm working on a case.
tell me.
this is what a relationship looks like.
how was your day, dear?
I'll tell you when it's over.
Tony, I thought I told you I would...
shut up. You gotta get back here right now.
okay. - Now!
okay.
you have to go already?
well, we're looking for a terrorist, and Tony says we just found him, so...
I'll see you later?
thank you. - You're welcome.
is this seat taken?
this is a little like that scene in Heat when Pacino and DeNiro finally meet.
I'm De Niro in this scene?
you think you're DeNiro in this scene. Okay.
you can call me Al.
I'll spare you the singing.
you've come to chase her away from me.
in the very tan flesh. Trip to L. A. did you good.
Ziva prefers darker skin.
how does she like being played?
cause I think we both know; this romance isn't kosher.
I can understand your suspicions, given what we have about you in your dossier...
agent Meatball.
there's an El Al flight tonight out of Ronald Reagan at 8: 25 p. m.
lands at Ben-Gurion tomorrow evening.
I'm not finished spending time with Ziva.
NCIS says you are.
Ziva's very lucky to have a man like you in her life.
like a... big brother.
I've got some work to do, and you clearly have some drinking to finish, and after that, I think you should start packing.
you can question my feelings for Ziva all you want.
unfortunately, you can't question her feelings for me. Can you?
say good-bye, Mikey. Get on the flight.
we've reconstructed everyone's movements from last night on this is a wire frame representation of the SecNav's residence.
these blue figures represent the agents on patrol.
the units moved in overlapping sweeping patterns on the outer layer.
the inner layer was stationary.
sophisticated.
even if someone managed to get through the outer ring unseen, their path would be limited.
they'd be funneled into plain sight.
so, what went wrong?
well, there's a hole in the net.
when Sherman leaves to take the position on the patio, leaves this avenue wide open.
Yes, it does.
well, you got an explanation?
it's an error.
nobody's perfect, Jules. Not you and not this guy. We'll find him.
Ziva, you got those backgrounds?
almost finished. These are what we have so far.
got to check in with my boss. - Sure.
Abby needs my help with the bug. - Go.
this idea of friendly relations between agencies, full disclosure...
flies in the face of history.
you vouch for the ICE princess?
she's cool on the outside, but when she opens up, she's...
she's full of beans, molten cheese, like a microwave burrito.
what? I'm hungry.
so when the bug is working properly, it emits a signal that can piggyback on any available internet connection, and then, it can upload the audio to a live stream on a private Web site.
Oh, so, basically, it's a fancy tin can.
we follow the string to the can on the other end.
what, you never camped out in the backyard as a kid?
are you crazy? There were alligators in my backyard.
you know, you don't really need my help with this.
second set of hands can't hurt.
you are feeling neglected?
neglected? More like nauseous.
having to watch you flirt with that Jules.
come on. I wasn't flirting.
your hands drifting across the keyboard.
pinkies accidentally grazing each other.
please. I know.
she's out of my league, anyway, Abs.
no, she's not.
we have not found Tabal yet.
we really should be working harder.
I came back here quickly because you said we had found Abin Tabal.
where were you?
where were you?
he was in L. A. on business just like he's in D. C. on business.
I cannot believe you. If you wanted to meet him, you could ask me to introduce you.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't check on him.
Gibbs told him to clock out.
I told him to clock out.
perhaps it would carry some more weight if it came from you.
michael is here to see me. He is not working. He is on vacation.
well, he certainly is drinking like it.
conference room this way?
I'll show you.
cpb hasn't gotten a hit yet on any of Abin Tabal's known aliases.
likely he's still in the country.
the invisible man.
the results of interviews with every member of your team last night.
there were some bad feelings circulating.
inevitable with any team, I imagine.
performance reviews-- Agent Sherman's and yours.
he had four more years of service than you did, but you were promoted over him.
with good cause. You'll notice my evals and recs were consistently higher.
he openly objected to taking orders from a woman with less seniority.
you can't have appreciated that.
agent Sherman was very passionate about his duty.
he was a thorn in your side.
let's just stop right here, before you embarrass yourselves by actually accusing me of killing Agent Sherman!
I lost an agent last night.
maybe that gets easier with time, but for me, it's...
I've been trying not to kick dirt on a dead man's grave.
that's my mistake.
his death is not...
he wasn't supposed to be on the patio.
he was out of position.
he disregarded his assignment.
Why? - I don't know.
spite. Jealousy.
he was never concerned about making me look bad.
there was a hole in the net because he moved.
he's dead for the same reason he never got the promotion.
he didn't operate as part of a team.
and you do?
Yeah. Gibbs.
Yeah. All right.
Abby's got a link to Tabal.
you are coming?
schematics of SecNav's house.
looks like our guy. - So does this.
well, at least now we know he really existed.
potassium cyanide poisoning.
we found a residue of silica and polyisoprene between his first and second premolars.
he bit down on a suicide pill.
just a few hours ago. - Yeah.
no signs of forced entry at the motel.
no indication of any struggle.
Abin Tabal killed himself.
this guy's supposed to be invisible.
that's his primary asset as an operative.
he loses that when he accidentally kills an American agent.
his usefulness is gone.
we close off all exit routes.
so he decides to take the only other way out.
you back this psychology?
Yeah. If-If he was a true believer.
if he believed himself a threat to the cause, then exposure becomes his enemy.
if he removes himself, he removes the problem.
after he's passed on all the intel he's managed to accumulate.
he wiped his computer.
sifting through it.
but she already connected the laptop to the electronics and the listening device?
smoking gun.
case closed. Write it up.
I think you're already packed up, McGee.
he's delaying his departure to coincide with someone else.
it was nice working with you guys. Thank you for everything.
Yeah, you, too. - You, too.
I'll walk out with you.
so what did Gibbs and Fornell have to say?
they were just apologizing for implying I might be a murderer.
you're kidding. They were? - Yes.
the both of them? - That's so shocking?
well, uh...
you know, it might take a while to fully grasp the significance of that.
okay. Explain it to me. I've got no plans.
all right.
did Gibbs actually say the words, "I'm sorry"?
good night. - Night.
rule Number 11, DiNozzo.
I would never date a co-worker, boss. Trust me.
I mean, why would you even...
that's 12.
11. when the job is done, walk away.
the case is wrapped up, DiNozzo.
in a nice, little bow.
and, and that works for you, Fornell? Crazy terrorist kills himself.
can't really understand that mentality.
doesn't mean I can't accept it.
so what's on your mind?
Rivkin's been in town.
I know.
with Ziva.
guy doesn't listen.
does that bother you on a professional level or a personal one?
well, I tell you what-- I'm having a little trouble untangling the two.
so you are bothered.
Oh, yeah.
it bothers me. You stay on it.
Yep.
how'd you know what I like to drink, Gibbs?
my older brother gave me my first bourbon, before I was even a teenager.
he liked to mess with my head.
my grandfather had a still.
it blew up once...
and he ran back inside to rescue his sour mash.
it is a living thing.
it's safe to talk here?
safer than your house.
it was a point of pride with my brother, though.
I never hit you, he'd say.
preferred psychological warfare.
you're an only child, aren't you, Gibbs?
the Corps.
strangers... become brothers in a foxhole.
that why you've been digging dirt?
trying to get closer to Leon?
no.
I never asked for this.
never opened it.
well...
let's see what the CIA's got on Leon Vance.
I thought we shredded all these.
how does this thing keep finding its way into the open?
it's not even real.
lucky you didn't read this.
wouldn't give you the whole picture anyway.
and you will?
is that Tabal's laptop? - Yeah.
before Tabal killed himself, he wiped all the sensitive information.
Oh, so there's nothing useful on it, huh?
he did fail to erase the laptop's network location memory.
it's a log that records all previous network connections, so you can access them easily in the future.
all that's going to tell us is where he's used the Internet before.
bring that up.
I know that address. - Yeah. Me, too.
it's Ziva's.
lot of black bars covering Leon's career.
man was born for counterintelligence.
you didn't peg him for a lifelong bureaucrat...
Nah. Figured he'd worn a few hats.
heard a whisper or two.
there's not a second of his life I can't account for.
I might hit him with a stick every now and then, but, uh,
I did not leave him out of that poker game because I don't trust him.
you were discussing how to use him.
Yeah, I know.
since Director Shepard's death, you've been concerned with the danger in having the wrong person at the top.
well, you're not alone.
you're not the only one looking out for the integrity of NCIS.
leon's going to be point man in a major operation.
who's the enemy? - That's the problem. It's our friends.
the Israelis. Top priority.
ever since Shepard created that unorthodox position of "liaison officer.
you're talking about Ziva David.
father's the director of Mossad, half-brother was a rogue operative.
he died in this room, didn't he? At your hand.
and she works with you every day.
what a family.
Ziva, it's Tony.
you're here.
Ziva is not.
she'll be back soon.
you're welcome to come in and wait for her.
did you really expect me to leave her because you threaten me?
I had my hopes.
did they include you coming here late at night?
maybe finding Ziva in an emotional state?
you help her pick up the pieces?
I'm here about a case.
an American agent was killed last night.
all the evidence points to a terrorist named in Tabal.
I think you're familiar with him.
of course, he killed himself before we could catch up to him.
zealot. - That's the theory.
it's a little too clean for me.
does not sound clean at all.
sounds like the further you dig, the messier it gets.
well, what can I say?
the events of the past year have made me a little suspicious.
even to the people closest to you?
Oh, especially them.
we pulled information from Tabal's computer.
says that, at some point, the internet was connected here.
Ziva's account.
she is tied to this dead man?
who is obviously duplicitous.
practiced in the art of misinformation.
that appears to be the shape of things.
you're here to question Ziva?
all because a series of numbers on a terrorist's computer?
I was.
until you opened the door.
semper Fi.
you and Leon gotta play nice.
you are ordering me to trust him?
just to follow him.
we don't hit our brothers.
soon as you're done with your drink, Michael, you're under arrest for the murders of Abin Tabal and Federal Agent Tom Sherman.
good luck with that.
enough!
don't do it. - No.
don't!
never get tired of this sight.
Ah, you and me both.
Where's number three?
McMannis? - Yes?
we have a loose one.
I can't take much more of this!
it's driving us crazy!
Where's Taylor?
maybe she got lucky and escaped.
they're coming.
Oh, my God!
tell me you did not just wave at me, Vance?!
you call yourself a supermodel?
right now the only thing you are super at is looking like an idiot on TV!
I count two of you.
where is little princess number three?
Oh, my God.
the next award to be presented is the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal.
would Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs please step forward.
she went with the elf cut?
it's called the "pixie."
I think she looks terrific.
Where's Gibbs?
all the years I've known him, he's never once turned up for an awards ceremony.
even if he's the one receiving, Ducky?
especially if he's the one receiving it.
special Agent Gibbs?
told you he wouldn't show.
pay up.
you got change for a 20?
no.
nice haircut.
where the hell is he, DiNozzo?
he's working on a case.
what case?
the one that's preventing him from being here. I'll take that for him, though.
accepting for Special Agent Gibbs is Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
she's pretty.
I'd like to think I'm the Michael Douglas to his Karl Malden - on the streets of D. C... - And thank you, everybody.
that concludes our awards ceremony. Thank you.
Gibbs... Gibbs thanks you... Thank you.
is this on? I have a speech. I didn't...
I wrote a whole...whole thing.
where are you?
I'm right behind you.
I really hate it when you do that.
Tony has your award.
he can keep it.
some things never change, do they, Jethro?
depends on your definition of change.
my definition...
I expect you to be there the next time I'm handing you an award.
DiNozzo didn't tell you? I'm working a case.
Oh, alone in my office? - It's high-profile, Jen.
I thought you'd want to hear about it before it hits the news.
I'm listening.
well, there's a dead celebrity at Quantico.
who?
some woman named Taylor Shane.
the supermodel?
found her hanging from an OCS security fence this morning.
then why aren't you there?
I just got the call five minutes ago.
Oh, and the awards ceremony started 30 minutes ago.
well, you know me- I like to get a head start on things. I'll keep you informed.
Jethro, the press is going to be all over this one.
I'd appreciate it if you could go easy on them.
telling me how to do my job, Director?
no, just reiterating your previous point.
which was?
I know you.
break out the gear.
boot Camp Babes is a real TV show?
reality TV at its finest. Three hot, rich babes learning what's truly important in life.
defending their country.
no, firing machine guns while wearing bikinis.
I think I like your reason better, Ziva.
your Marine Corps would actually allow these models to serve?
well, they're not joining for real.
it's a stunt. Kind of like The Simple Life.
the Simple Life?
Yeah, that show about Paris Hilton?
I never heard of it.
but I've been there a few times.
I wouldn't mind spending a night there myself.
Oh, you have no idea. I often dream about it.
Really?
what?
just trying to picture Paris and you together.
don't get your hopes up.
I'm not attracted to blondes.
this is bad.
Gibbs is going to go completely and utterly ape...
here he comes.
what happened to the girl? What are you hiding?
I just got here.
what is the official word on Taylor Shane's cause of death?
like I said, I just got here.
what condition was her body found in?
I just got here. I haven't even had a chance...
what about the other girls? How are the other girls handling it?
how are they handling it...?
okay, that's it. Interview's over.
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
I don't care.
sergeant...
secure the area.
special Agent Gibbs...
wow, she really was beautiful.
she still is, Mr. Palmer.
she's been dead at least five hours, Jethro.
I'm more interested in how she got that way, Duck.
well, her body is covered with these lacerations.
none of them appear to be fatal.
we'll know more when we get her back.
um... I'll just go get the gurney now.
who moved the body?
I did, sir.
didn't think it was right them taking pictures of Taylor hanging on the wire like that.
you have any crime scene experience, Staff Sergeant McMannis?
no, sir. But I do have public affairs experience.
photos like that aren't why the Corps agreed to support this show.
you the liaison?
Yes, sir.
we've been trying to contact the producer, Thomas Crawley.
he doesn't know anything about this yet.
how'd she get up there?
looked like she was trying to climb over. That doesn't make any sense, sir.
if she wanted off the show, all she had to do was ask. It's not like this is a real boot camp.
McGee, photos.
Ziva, interview the rest of the models. DiNozzo...
boss, I'm pretty familiar with the show. Maybe I should interview them.
that would work for me. I hate models.
is that so?
McGee... Help Ziva... interview them.
any other suggestions, DiNozzo?
no, I think I got it.
good.
I'm going to need to see all the footage that you shot on this thing.
you got it, sir. Post production office is right over here.
do you want me to get their autographs, Tony?
Hey, Probie...
see if you can get them to sign it to the "Big D.
what was she doing out there, Hannah?
probably just looking for a bigger story line.
think about it, Nat, the big escape. Would have made some great TV.
unfortunately, it did.
special Agent McGee, and Officer David, NCIS. We would like to ask you a few questions.
in private, please. - Okay, let's go.
when was the last time you saw Ms. Shane?
lights out. - Time?
around 10: 30.
do you really believe she did this as a stunt?
I don't know. I mean, Taylor would do anything for more camera time.
Hannah, she's dead, okay? Stop being a bitch.
the cameras are off, Natalie.
you can stop pretending you cared about her.
hmm, you didn't get along.
we're supermodels, honey.
we don't have to get along.
on the show you three seem like such good friends.
they shoot us 24 hours a day, Agent McGee.
you only get to see 23 minutes of it.
Hey, just about done here, boss. Thought I might check on the rest of the team...
you're riding with the body.
make sure those damn reporters don't follow you back.
how am I supposed to do that...? - Improvise.
give me the keys. I'm driving.
Thanks, Ducky.
anything else I can help you with?
like maybe some hair tips for your girlfriend here?
no, I think that about covers it.
but if you can remember anything else that might help, please give us a call.
it's called a business card.
maybe you can have one of the marines read it to you.
no bones broken, no major arteries severed and take a look at the tox screen.
her death was not the result of tangling with the razor wire.
phencyclidine. Angel dust.
Yeah. It's an overdose of PCP.
drove that poor girl flailing into that fence.
she had a seizure, fell into a coma and died.
an accidental overdose, Duck?
I doubt it. She had enough PCP in her system to kill a small water buffalo.
water buffalo?
I tire of saying small horse.
I'm afraid our young model might have committed suicide.
we don't investigate suicides, Duck.
we don't investigate suicides?
technically no.
but even the most obvious suicide is investigated by NCIS as a murder.
on a Marine base surrounded by cameras...
Yes.
the stuff good mysteries are made of, Mr. Palmer.
the incident shocked the entertainment industry and entire nation.
the sudden and gruesome death of super model and recent reality star, Taylor Shane.
the 25-year-old was found at approximately 6: 10 yesterday morning, hanging atop a barrier fence at the Quantico Marine base.
Shane was at Quantico participating in hit reality show Boot Camp Babes.
I'll just fast forward to the good part.
special Agent Gibbs, is the Marine Corps attempting to cover up how Taylor Shane died.
the interview's over.
the people have a right to know.
I don't care.
what were you thinking?
give me a break, Jen, I wasn't even asked that question.
you're saying they did a hatchet job on you?
Yeah, are you saying you don't believe me?
you were wrong the other day. Some things do change.
part of our job is to make sure that they don't creatively edit our interviews, Jethro.
no, that's maybe your job, Director. My job is to catch dirtbags.
the Marine Corps does not need anymore bad publicity at this moment.
supporting something called Boot Camp Babes? What did they think was gonna happen?
the intention of the show was to represent that the Marines could be a life changing experience.
I have a dead girl downstairs and an investigation to run.
I've got an entire agency to run, and sound bites like these do not help when the budget's under review.
or maybe you'd like to go back to the days when we had to buy our own ammo to train on the range.
okay, you want me to help fix this? Then get me that reporter's number.
you're going to apologize?
no, ask her to dinner.
there's Ducky. Ducky looks good.
here's the autopsy gremlin.
there it is! Right there. That's my jacket.
that's McGee's jacket.
I didn't make a single broadcast.
I wish I could say the same.
camera must have added about ten pounds to me.
actually, that was your refrigerator, Probie.
you think Gibbs watched the news last night?
I know the director did.
he's been up in her office for the past half an hour.
anyone else think they were more than just partners back in the day?
Hi, boss.
we're just talking about Cagney and Lacey. It was a real good show.
what we got?
Taylor Shane checked into the Los Angeles Better Health Center in August of '02 and then again in May of '03.
publicist said it was an eating disorder, but, uh, the truth is it was heroin, cocaine and...
PCP. - Bingo, boss.
friends have given several interviews over the years.
they blame her drug problem mostly on the boyfriend,
Noah Keller, son of Marshall Keller.
Ooh, that guy owns half of Manhattan. His kids are loaded, too.
well, this kid was arrested for possession of illegal narcotics three times in the last five years. Twice for cocaine, once for PCP.
find him.
already on it.
that executive show guy, Crawley? He got back last night?
the term is "executive producer."
whatever. Interview him.
I want to know how this girl did a fistful of PCP in the middle of his reality show.
that guy dates super models?
they're shallow, he's wealthy. It's the perfect match.
isn't your family wealthy?
that's different.
Why?
my dad cut me off when I was 12.
I had to earn all my dates the old fashioned way.
begging.
Hey, Abs, got some good news for you.
just talked to the director, your new assistant starts Monday.
no, Gibbs.
no, I can't go through that again.
that is so not funny.
no? - No.
it was to me, kind of. Here you go.
where are we?
well, I know why no one heard Taylor screaming when she was on the wire the other night.
two 300-car trains passed by OCS the same time she died.
I doubt anyone could have heard anything.
you on a new diet, Abs? - Yep according to Ducky, there were no signs of intravenous drug use on the body, and there were traces of PCP in the lungs.
she took it orally.
but...
there were also no traces of the binders and chemicals you would find when something's taken by pill.
Yeah, well, I'm guessing that's what all this is about.
you would be guessing right.
there were traces of PCP in her stomach.
there was also dextrose, ferrous sulfate, riboflavin and a bunch of other chemicals that are consistent with these delectable pastries.
okay, which one?
that's what I've been trying to figure out. It's kind of fun. It reminds me of Bill Nye.
who?
bill Nye the Science Guy? Wacky scientist with a kid's show?
Oh, like Mr. Wizard.
who?
never mind. - So, anyways,
bill Nye did an episode where he broke down the molecular structure of junk food pastries, same thing I did today, only Bill Nye was trying to get kids to eat healthier, and his pastries weren't laced with PCP, although Bill Nye once...
Abby, the case?
two things I know.
one, I like cream filling, and two, her last meal was this.
I think we're looking at death by Klowny Kake.
that's good work, Abs.
Taylor got along with everyone, Hannah.
everyone but you.
your point is, Staff Sergeant?
she committed suicide for a reason, I want to know why.
how the hell would I know?
you been abusing her on and off camera for the past two months.
Oh, so it's my fault she decided to off herself?
I want to know what happened in this room last night.
well, let's see.
I went to bed,
Natalie probably snuck off two or three times to the bathroom to throw up, and Taylor...
well, she apparently decided to hang herself from a barbed wire fence.
anything else I can help you with, Staff Sergeant?
you're a real piece of work, Bressling.
get out of my sight. I'll see you at the pull-up bars.
with pleasure.
is this a bad time, Staff Sergeant?
no, ma'am.
just counting the days till this reality show is off of my base.
we need to speak with Thomas Crawley.
so do I, sir.
he's asked not to be disturbed.
a girl died from a drug overdose while taping the show.
disturbing him is not our primary concern.
Taylor overdosed? On what?
PCP, a lot of it.
that's why she tried to climb that fence because she was on drugs?
she was most likely delusional.
perhaps she thought someone was chasing her.
you know how she got the drugs, Staff Sergeant?
no, sir.
I know she had some problems in the past, but if anything, she was anti-drugs.
hell, she wouldn't even take an aspirin.
Where's Crawley, Staff Sergeant?
his office. It's just outside that door.
Mr. Crawley.
Mr. Crawley?
I'm sorry.
please,
I was thinking about my daughter.
her death just...
Taylor Shane was your daughter?
I became her legal guardian when she was 15.
we've been through a lot together, but...
were you aware that she had a drug problem?
Taylor's been clean and sober for over two years now.
she OD'd on PCP.
no, no. There's no way. She would never go through that again.
statistically, addicts fall back in times of stress.
meaning Marine boot camp probably wasn't the best environment for her.
this entire reality series was Taylor's idea.
I've never seen her happier. She loved it here.
how did she get the drugs?
she didn't.
the whole point of the show was to show that she wasn't that girl anymore.
well, I'd say it backfired, large time.
it's "big" time.
get up!
let's go! Move!
come on. Show me what you're made of!
come on now. Just two more!
I can't do it anymore!
what did I tell you about the word "can't,"Bressling?!
Taylor's the only one who took any of this Marine stuff seriously.
but you knew that, right, Sarge?
get the cameras out of here.
Yes, sir. Back it up, guys.
was he here?
answer me, Hannah.
you're hurting her arm, sir.
my daughter's dead, Staff Sergeant. If she's responsible, I'll do more than that.
Hey, no one's doing anything around here but calming down.
who is "he"?
Noah Keller, Taylor's ex.
Noah Keller, he was here?
a couple of days ago. Big deal.
did you know this?
no, sir.
staff Sergeant, can you take Mr. Crawley for a walk? We need to talk to the girls alone.
you need to let NCIS handle it.
I'll talk to you when they're done.
we'll be here, Tom. We don't wrap for another three days.
is that Berry Mango Madness?
Yes.
we haven't had anything but Marine food since we got here.
I'll give you a hundred bucks for it.
it's not for sale.
it's free.
just like love.
you know, I'm a big fan of the show.
you guys are really beautiful and great and the show is excellent.
Thanks, cutie.
why didn't you tell me that Taylor's boyfriend had visited her?
she made us promise not to say anything.
well, you know, she's dead, so I don't think she'll mind.
you saw the way Tom reacted.
he hates Noah. He blames him for Taylor's drug habit.
was she using while she was here?
considering we're in a Marine boot camp, no. None of us have used any drugs.
Noah just came to talk to her. They were having some relationship problems.
Taylor thought he was using again.
what?
it just makes sense.
someone gave her enough PCP to kill the three of you.
when was the last time you heard from Mr. Keller?
hang up the phone, McGee.
boss, I'm on the phone with Noah Keller's accountant.
he's at the Cranston Motel in Triangle, Virginia right outside the main gate at Quantico.
how'd you track him down?
I got an urgent call from the President.
his AMEX records were in the fax machine, McGee.
come on.
I specifically told her to e-mail those.
millions of dollars, supermodel girlfriend, this is where he stays?
well, he showed up in style.
I think I would have rather slept in the car.
that one.
Yeah, Gibbs?
boss,
Noah Keller was in Quantico the day before Taylor Shane died.
Yeah, I see him now, DiNozzo.
don't bother, McGee.
a young person's death is never easy, McGee, but two in 24 hours, and both self-afflicted, well, that's... tragic.
he got off easy, Duck.
drugs he gave his girlfriend had her thrashing herself to death in a barbed-wire fence.
these people can have everything, and this is how they end up?
well, wealth and fame have often gone hand in hand with fatal addiction.
Edgar Allan Poe, Keith Moon.
Kurt Cobain.
Yeah, the list goes on and on.
this one's been dead about 24 hours, Jethro.
Yeah, well, that means he offed himself the same night his girlfriend O. D.'d.
well, the froth around the mouth suggests a breakdown of the nervous system.
PCP?
Yeah, possible, but not probable. Look.
pinpoint pupils, blue discoloration around the fingernails.
no, I'd say his death was the result of diacetylmorphine.
heroin.
Yeah. I would say you're right, Ducky.
that a suicide note?
not exactly.
it's time for us to realize that this just isn't meant to be.
please know that it was never my intention to hurt you.
I will always remember the great times we've had.
this is a Dear John letter.
postmarked six days ago from Quantico Post Office.
handwriting checks out.
Taylor Shane sent it.
Yeah. Noah Keller came by to chat about it.
very Romeo and Juliet.
Yeah, except for the part where he feeds her a toxic Klowny Kake and offs himself.
this must have been a very difficult letter for her to write.
probably harder for him to read. No one likes getting dumped by postal express.
maybe he didn't listen. Relationships change.
some people don't know when to let go.
I have to brief the C. G of Quantico first thing in the morning on this, and I'd like you to be there when I do that.
negative, Jen- all we have is circumstantial evidence so far.
we don't even have anything to tie the two deaths together yet.
well, I can't call the general and tell him we have nothing.
you can always write him a letter.
they're for you.
they're really black.
really, really... black.
it's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
get Well Soon?
they didn't have a card that said...
sorry I almost sent you to prison at the flower shop.
almost? You actually did send me to prison.
well, not for good.
Abby... I don't know what to say, Abby.
these... Just say that you don't hate me.
I could never hate you. I don't think anyone could ever hate you.
Oh, you don't know Billy Bob.
you... gave him black roses?
no. I gave him two black eyes.
he tried to run over me with a Harley Fatboy when I was sleeping in the living room.
a guy rode a motorcycle through your living room?
Yeah. No. Well, it was his living room, my Harley.
Billy Bob had, um, intimacy issues.
don't forget to water them, or they'll die.
I thought they already were dead.
laugh now, cry later.
it's an interesting concept, Mr. Palmer.
unfortunately for our guest here, the laughter has ended.
my friend who went to NYU said this guy was the club king of New York.
he was almost legendary.
well, if he wasn't before, he most certainly is now.
and apparently, he only went out with models and A-list celebrities.
this guy got the VIP treatment everywhere he went.
you writing a gossip column, Palmer?
I- I was just informing Dr. Mallard that he... that he...
we... I...
talk to me, Duck.
our initial assumptions were far from correct.
when I examined him just now,
I found fresh bruises on his upper back, the left shoulder.
the X rays indicated a severe fracture of the left scapula and a clavicle that was almost completely crushed.
he was in a fight?
Yeah. Well, injuries of that nature, his left arm would be completely useless.
someone else shot him up.
well, Abby's tox screen showed that Mr. Keller had a blood-alcohol level of 0.34.
his heart was pumping so slowly that most of the heroin was never even metabolized.
he was passed out.
Yes. I'm afraid our young man was unconscious when the drug was administered.
from Abby?
I thought this show was just mindless entertainment.
it's called research, Tony. And I'm merely looking for a lead.
well, this is only the beginning.
before you know it, you'll be sitting at home eating a large box of chocolates, watching the Food Network on your 50-inch plasma.
we're not all so easily corrupted. Take McGee, for example.
he's been raised in America his entire life, and he rarely turns the television on.
tell him, McGee.
Yeah, tell him, McGee.
w- Well, uh...
depends what you consider "rarely."
I might watch 20 minutes here or there.
tell her what you do the rest of the time, Probie.
it's not TV.
he pretends to be a fairy in an online computer game.
it's an elf lord.
whatever.
Keller didn't commit suicide, he was murdered.
what the hell are you two doing? Find out why.
Hey, uh, I got to call you back.
boss, I think I might have something.
are you waiting for me to guess... elf lord?
no. Sorry. Um,
I was searching through Noah Keller's cell phone records.
the night that he died, he received three calls.
two were from his business manager, the other was from Hannah Bressling.
I've known Noah since high school.
we used to sneak into the Limelight, like, every weekend.
Limelight- that's, uh, that club in Chelsea.
Yeah. You been?
actually, no, I, uh...
I saw it on Wild On.
sounded like it was a pretty exclusive place.
even as a kid, Noah seemed to know all the right people.
I don't think he waited in line his entire life.
money tends to open doors.
Oh, he didn't use his dad's money as a crutch.
Really?
Yeah, everyone always assumed that he was popular only because he was rich and...
that that was the reason he dated models.
I'm sure it didn't hurt.
no, women liked Noah because he was charismatic and interesting.
I mean, most guys that come from money are womanizers whose life revolves around their car.
were you and Noah ever an item?
we dated on and off for a couple of years, but...
we sort of lost touch when he hooked up with Taylor.
when did he get involved with drugs?
people say he got her started, but it's not true.
they both made that leap together.
did you speak to him when he came to see Taylor?
no. He was, um, drunk and really upset.
but I called him later that night just to make sure that he was safe.
I just can't imagine why anyone would have wanted to hurt him.
what are you doing?
I just stopped by to drop you something off, Jethro.
looked to me like you were playing agent.
I left you four messages today.
Really?
I only got three.
Noah Keller's death was murder, not suicide.
that's something I should probably know.
it sounds like you do.
this case is getting more attention by the hour. I trust...
that you will keep me informed.
trust is a two-way street.
what are you saying, Jethro, you don't trust me?
of course I trust you.
is that all?
for now.
I can save you the trouble.
on today's Channel Six News, per Director Shepard's demands,
Cynthia Sanchez issued a retraction on Monday's story.
she was also forced to issue a public apology to one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
our director has friends in high places, yes?
something I can do for you, Officer David?
Abby needs to see you. Said she found something.
I looked through all the Boot Camp Babes footage from the night Taylor Shane died.
she was nowhere to be seen.
she knew where the cameras were placed. Also knew how to avoid them.
not all of them. A few minutes ago, I found this.
it's from a Quantico security camera that was placed on top of the mess hall.
this video was taken about two hours before Taylor Shane died.
I presume not many people stroll around Quantico at 1: 00 a. m.
can you zoom in, Abs?
my new enhancer program is booting up as we speak.
I've been waiting for the chance to bust out this bad boy.
this should clear it up a bit.
Taylor was with Staff Sergeant McMannis?
when's Gibbs planning on starting?
this is one of his techniques.
Really?
leaves the guy alone in a cold, dimly lit room.
and then, just as the guy starts to zone out, bursts in the door and rifles off some questions.
I call it "rock the baby."
I see.
and does it work?
Oh, just watch.
in a few moments, that door's going to fly open and this big, bad Marine is going to jump like a little girl.
what the hell's with you, DiNozzo?
nothing. Uh...
I was just telling Ziva about your interrogation techniques.
I'm not interrogating McMannis. You are.
Ooh, thanks, boss.
you know, I could've used a little more prep time...
I'm not talking to you, DiNozzo.
he is all yours, Officer David.
you are aware that I've never performed an interrogation without inflicting some sort of pain.
this footage was pulled from a Quantico security camera.
it was taken at 0117.
the morning Taylor Shane was murdered.
it's an interesting technique.
she doesn't want to tempt herself.
tell me what you know, Staff Sergeant.
okay if I dip, ma'am?
I promised Taylor I'd quit.
we're both addicted to nicotine.
a supermodel who spits tobacco?
she smoked, but it's against the rules at boot camp.
so you supplied her with your snuff there?
Yes, ma'am.
and junk food?
sometimes.
and the midnight walks?
you did that with every girl,
staff Sergeant?
no, just Taylor.
we didn't want anybody to find out about us until the show ended.
find out what?
that we were in love, ma'am.
this is the worst defense imaginable.
the idea of a supermodel falling in love with a guy like this.
okay, why is that?
well, it's absolutely ridiculous, you know?
supermodels date guys like George Clooney, or guys with George Clooney's bank account or, of course, the actual George Clooney, but not guys like this.
they don't date guys like this.
definitely not guys like this.
meaning, Marines, DiNozzo?
no, I didn't say that.
I mean, I would never say that.
he thought I meant Marines.
Yeah. Gibbs.
I got something for you.
I'll be right there.
Abby's got something.
Hey, you were a lot of help.
Taylor was nothing like her reputation.
she was, she was... normal, like a regular girl.
I know it sounds weird, ma'am, but I fell in love with her the moment I met her.
and she felt the same way?
we were going to get married once the show ended.
she was done with modeling.
she... she was sick of the whole lifestyle.
and the reason you failed to mention you were with her a few hours before she died?
who'd have believe me, ma'am?
hell, it was my life.
I barely believe it myself.
I believe you.
you do?
so I'm free to go?
no.
I think we will charge you with murder instead.
but you just... you said you believed me, ma'am.
I would never, ever have done anything to hurt her.
what about the man who supplied Taylor with the drugs that killed her?
answer the question, Staff Sergeant.
I'm not feeling too well, ma'am.
this is the final wardrobe of Taylor Shane.
could not imagine a worse way to go.
I could.
she planted herself on a barbed-wire fence. What could possibly be worse?
my top three are falling into a wood chipper, drowning in lava, and being eaten by a shark.
guessing you've thought about this before.
on and off for the last 25 years.
you know, I read a statistic that says you're more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by a shark.
not if you're a seal.
what do we have, Abs?
I broke down the origin of each and every stain on Taylor's clothes.
most are blood, mud, rust, and sweat.
most?
Yes. This stain here, under the collar, has traces of PCP mixed with formaldehyde, sodium and nicotine.
tobacco. - Yep.
the PCP wasn't laced in the Klowny Cake.
it was laced in this.
are you sure you don't want some more water, Staff Sergeant?
I... I have to leave here now!
sit down, Staff Sergeant.
what are you doing to me?!
I believe Officer David asked you to sit down.
you did this to me!
you're trying to destroy me!
the guy just went crazy, boss.
he's ODing on PCP.
get a medical team in here, DiNozzo.
Where'd you get the chew, Sergeant?
sergeant!
from the show.
what's happening to me, sir?
you've been drugged.
but you'll be alright now.
hush.
this is what I would call some serious snuff.
the Staff Sergeant's chew was laced with 400 milligrams of PCP.
a typical hit for a user would be between seven and ten milligrams.
I knew that dude could've have taken me if he wasn't juiced.
what are his chances, Abby?
depends on how much PCP he ingested.
how long was he dipping?
that long, huh?
let's just hope he has better luck than Taylor Shane.
okay, great. Thank you.
staff Sergeant McMannis is stable at Bethesda. Still in critical condition.
any prints?
I was able to lift two latent prints.
one matches Staff Sergeant McMannis...
and the other? - No owner yet.
but it does match a print lifted from Noah Keller's syringe.
whoever killed Taylor, killed Keller.
what's that for?
it's a fingerprint kit.
Why?
someone tried to kill Staff Sergeant McMannis today.
his chewing tobacco was laced with PCP. Whoever did it left a print on the can.
the same person who murdered Taylor Shane and Noah Keller.
whoa. You think it was one of us?
Oh, we know it was one of you.
you were always jealous of her, Hannah. You're also the one who introduced her to Keller.
me, jealous of a crackhead?
please, Tom, you're stretching it a bit.
but why would we? That doesn't make any sense.
Taylor Shane was in love with the staff sergeant.
Yeah, right. You've got to be joking.
no, we're not.
well, then fingerprint away, sweetheart. It wasn't me.
we don't need it. They're already on your arrest record.
from the time you beat up your assistant with a cell phone, I believe?
well, it wasn't me.
Nope. We've got yours, too.
Yeah. Remember that time you drove your SUV through the front of Limelight?
whoa. What is this?
I-I loved Taylor.
wait a minute. I'm not giving you permission to take my fingerprints. I want to talk to my lawyer first.
we don't need anybody's permission. You're under arrest for murder.
you didn't want Taylor to give up her career to marry a Marine, but you couldn't stop her.
too bad she was addicted to nicotine, too.
you killed your own daughter?
it was an accident!
what was I supposed to do? She was going to throw her life away. Be some...
be some jarhead's housewife!
Thanks, Tom.
what's so funny, honey?
the ratings on this one will really be through the roof.
Ziva, no, no, no, no.
you really find her attractive?
Oh, yeah.
well, I want to shoot her.
Tony, it's a matter of opinion. How can I be wrong?
exactly. It's a matter of you having the wrong opinion.
why don't you two just agree to disagree?
I don't agree to that.
boss, the director's new hair, you like the way she cut it short?
she cut her hair?
never mind.
one race, that's the only way. Some of us are trying to put together a past. 27 years ago, my parents were in this race, they never made it to the finish line. I know because I was waiting on the other side. Some of us are trying to escape a past. You were pissed out just as much as I do. No, man, I wanna hurt him, that's the difference. It's my one chance to keep my husband alive, you've been shipped back to Baghdad.
message DELETED - has anybody called? - no!
it's a chance of the way they live. - How long? - A year dad!
I'm fine honey. I got a bad cold coming on. It's my chance to protect my baby. Is there some reason going home doesn't feel safe to you? And I'll do anything, betray anyone, to win 32 million, but two ways. It's better than three ways. I can't believe I'm hearing this. Welcome to the race.
Rome GEORGIA. After sunset but before dark, good luck.
CHECKPOINT: ROME GEORGI. DEADLINE: 6:02 P. M. SUNDOWN
outside Gainesville, Florida 406 miles to checkpoit
okay, try it again.
okay, okay! Stop, stop!
I didn't say get out of the truck, I said stop.
I need you back in there.
we're never going to get out of Florida, are we?
I don't know.
does the secret cabal that runs this race have roadside assistance?
Tully, this next checkpoint is 400 miles into the next state.
I am aware of that.
and he said we had to make it before dark, which means either an elimination round or a penalty.
I don't even want to think about.
I thought you said. Getting there fast wasn't enough.
Yes.
but getting there at all is helpful.
shouldn't you be trying to figure out the clue?
he gave us a ticket with an address.
I think I figured it out. Go to this address.
Yeah, I'm going to need you back in the truck.
you want me to try it again? - No.
wow, dude, did you see who that was?
they're done, homes.
I knew that piece of crap they were driving wouldn't make it out of the state.
I'm surprised this one made it into state.
what?
what are you talking about, man? This car is primo, baby.
in a vintage car show, maybe.
but in a cross-country road race?
it's not exactly what you call fuel efficient.
not the sturdiest thing either.
and the upholstery's a little...
anyway, I say we get something a little faster,stronger, more contemporary.
I can have it waiting for us at the next stop.
how'd you manage that, daddy's money?
let's just say we have options.
let me tell you something about this car, homes.
I won it off of Tommy Guerrero, one of the meanest, toughest hombres on my block.
hombre? - And he got it from Eddie Ortiz, who was even meaner and tougher thanTommy.
it was left to Eddie by Rafe Castro, one of the original Latin kings.
you know what I'm saying?
the car had multiple criminal owners.
this car is royalty, homes.
it belonged to kings and princes. Got a history.
you think I'm just gonna let that go?
you can forget about it.
Plus, I'd rather walk cross country than drive some piece of crap daddy paid for.
I don't need nothing from that man.
that's why you were robbing our house?
that shows what you know, homes.
it wasn't robbery, it was burglary.
robbery's when you jack somebody, like, with a gun.
burglary, it's all about the property, baby.
Plus, you do way less time for burglary.
is that what you did time for?
no, man.
speeding.
dad, how are you feeling?
better. I think.
where are we?
Oh, about 50 miles south of the georgia border.
you sure you're okay?
kind freaked me out with that whole fainting episode back at Cape Canaveral.
I'm fine, I just need to pace myself better.
violet, you're doing 85?
Oh, I know, isn't it pathetic?
cute boy and his brother just basically blew our doors in.
every time I try to push this thing to 90, it shakes worse than you do when I talk about birth control.
you're going too fast, Vi. Slow down.
dad, we have almost 400 miles to Rome, and sunset is at 6: 02 P. M.
if I slow down, we're not going to make it.
well...
hands at ten and two, then.
you wanted roadside assistance. I think we just got some.
Hey. - Hey, folks.
having a little trouble, are you? - Yes, we sure are, officer.
I can radio for a mechanic if you like. - We'd appreciate that.
turn around. Get down on the ground now!
what? - Get down on the ground now!
what's the problem?! - Ma'am, stay right there. Do not move.
what are you doing? What are you doing?
are you arresting him?
I'll send a unit to pick you up, ma'am.
I'd advise you get in that truck.
aren't you going to read me my rights?
you don't have any rights.
what, is that a joke?
Yeah. Here's the punch line.
outside Valdosta , Georgia 304 miles to checkpoint
so, um, do you think your friends are going to be very angry?
I wouldn't really call them friends.
especially now that you shot out their tires.
right. Yeah.
I barely knew those guys.
I met them once back during Katrina.
Oh. Yeah. I noticed the, uh, the Louisiana plates.
Yeah, well, there was this hospital where Susan worked, and all these patients had to be carried to higher ground after the levees broke, so I helped.
that's how we met.
that's very dramatic.
we were on the news.
local heroes, yada, yada.
that's probably why they asked us to compete in this thing.
what about you?
me? No.
I've never been on the news.
tifton , Georgia 248 miles to cherkpoint
do you really think we're in the lead?
can't say for sure.
the only other racers I've seen were in our rearview a half hour ago.
the time we're making, car'd have to be on jet fuel to beat us.
first place. So what are we gonna buy with all our millions?!
anything you want.
a house on its own private island?
island? - Come on. Not a big island.
but, you know, just enough room for you and me and a half dozen people that are gonna be waiting on us hand and foot.
I like the way you think.
before you call that realtor, by, we got to hit the road.
we got to protect this lead.
all the way to the final finish line.
how far away do you think that's gonna be?
you got me.
feels like the army, you know. They never really give any details.
they just point you towards something, tell you to run like hell for it.
I'm going to get something to drink. You want anything?
just you back in a hurry.
sooner we get there, more time we'll have to celebrate.
that's right!
initial casualty reports indicate 16 American wounded and three killed.
as part of our ongoing series, america's war, today we profile one of the soldiers killed in last night's action:
Speclist Mike Bakka.
Mike Bakka was born on april 14, 1982 in Holland, Michigan.
as a baseball player in high school, Mike enlisted in june 2003...
yo, did you see that chick in the Stang, where she went?
maybe she got off.
Yeah, just by looking at me, huh?
Hey, you think this is a riddle?
admit one.
maybe when we get to where we're going, we'll have to admit something.
like you might have to say what you were in prison for.
Oh, I think they already know that, homes.
I'm pretty sure they're the ones who got me out.
Seriously? - Must've wanted me in this thing pretty bad.
someone recognized some talent, you know?
pulled some strings, bro. - Someone?
who someone? - No clue.
they just handed me the race phone when they kicked me loose.
it was in my stuff.
so what talent?
what were you locked up for?
would you believe me if I said I killed a guy?
no.
would you believe me if I said I was innocent?
no.
Yeah.
state of Maryland didn't think so either.
is that where you grew up?
no, man.
Miami. - What?
you're kidding. - No.
we were that close this whole time, we didn't even know about each other?
bro, I've known about you since the day you were born.
what?
I was seven.
I remember my moms came home, she told me I had a little brother.
then she told me I was never going to meet him.
then why'd she tell you? - Because...
she wanted us to go to church and pray for you.
I guess that worked out okay, huh?
pray for me? Why?
she was like that.
yo, I think I see that chick back there.
should I let her catch up?
we're in a race.
right, right, right, right. Way to stay focused, bro.
Thanks.
FLORIOA HIGHWAY PATROL
excuse me.
I'm looking for someone that was just brought in--Alex Tully.
he was arrested on the side of the I-75 about 40 minutes ago.
assaulted, actually. I was a witness.
you want to report an assault? - I want to get my friend.
he was brutally attacked by one of your officers while being taken into custody.
and now I want him released.
what was the officer's name?
I don't know, I wasn't looking at his name tag.
um, Powell or something.
could it have been Poole? - Yes. Poole.
I think so.
and the name of your friend? - Tully. Alex tully.
uh, stephanie, see if we got a tully back there in holding.
and find out where officer poole is.
Alex Tully. So I finally got a name to go with the face.
what?
Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska.
that a nice place, Alex? - It's okay.
you live there with the little woman, do ya?
or did ya?
up until this, I guess.
missing
what are you doing so far away from home, Alex?
you and that blonde out putting these up on telephone poles?
look... officer... Poole, I don't know who it is you think I am.
Oh, I-I know who you are.
you're Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska. We've established that.
and before we talk about what you're doing here in Gainesville, I want to focus on what you were doing in Ashland, Kentucky, on July 12, 2003.
I've never even been to Kentucky.
this is not a good way to begin, Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska.
this is not a way to build trust, not when we both know that you were in Ashland, Kentucky on July 12, 2003.
and we know this because I was there, too...
and I saw you.
maybe this will refresh your memory.
do you recognize them, Alex Tully of Hastings, Nebraska?
no.
well, you should.
those are the people you killed.
so where'd you say your brother'd gone to, Miss Tully?
I didn't say where he went.
neither did he.
then I don't suppose he said when he might be back, either.
look, detective, as I told you on the phone, I spoke to my brother a few days ago he asked me to look after things while he was away.
I agreed. That's all I know.
and you don't find that odd?
this whole thing is odd, detective.
it's odd that someone broke into this house and took my sister-in-law.
it's odd that you're here looking for Alex when you should be looking for Kathryn.
that's what I'm trying to do.
good.
we'd welcome the help. - So would I.
so, help me, mrs. Freeman.
help me to understand why it is everyone here is looking for your brother's missing wife, but he picks this time to leave town.
you'd have to ask him.
I intend to.
what are you saying?
none of this smells right.
how does it smell, detective?
smells like he's running.
july 12, 2003. Ashland, Kentucky.
the first national credit union was held up by four armed men.
I've never been to Kentucky.
I was with the Ashland PD at the time.
my partner and I were first responders.
there was a shoot out. All four men escaped. Three bodies were left behind...
I didn't kill those people.
Gloria Starns, there to cash her husband's disability check...
I run a landscaping business in Nebraska.
Scott Hemple, 24-year-old bank employee. - I've never killed anyone.
and Robert Cruz. my partner. - I didn't shoot your partner.
I didn't say you pulled the trigger.
you weren't in the bank.
see, the wheel man, he doesn't wear a mask.
he just sits outside while the job goes down.
but. According to the law, he's just as guilty as the guy who does pull the trigger.
that was you in that car. That was you.
you've got the wrong man.
you got any kids, Alex?
you and, uh...
katheryn here? You got kiddies?
not yet.
Bobby had three.
only one of them was old enough to understand what happened to her daddy.
the other two...
they won't even have a memory of their father, but I'll always have a memory of Bobby laying there. Spitting up blood.
scared, knowing that he was done.
and another face...
that face.
Alex Tully, of Hastings, Nebraska. The wheel man.
you're wrong.
I'm not wrong and we both know it.
and how long this day goes is up to you.
we're gonna be here until you come clean.
until you admit who you really are.
I don't understand, baby.
it doesn't sound like you were even friends with this...
what's his name? - Mike Bakka.
we weren't friends, but I knew him.
his unit and mine did dry-terrain survival training in the Mojave together.
but you told me you already knew a couple dozen guys who got hurt over there.
why are you so upset now?
Ellie, my outfit did two weeks with Bakka's unit in hundred-degree heat eating dust and bugs.
I knew all those guys, yesterday we had 16 hurt and three killed.
so... ? - So why haven't I heard anything?
huh? A unit gets hit like that and people get on the horn.
I haven't heard word one.
its, it's weird.
you know, something's screwed up.
now, gimme the phone. I gotta make some calls, please.
no. - What?
not when you're going 92 miles an hour, no sir.
Ellie, I can drive and talk on the phone.
that's what they all say. Next thing, they're hamburger.
no. Let's wait till we get to Rome. - Ellie, I'm not kidding.
look. We are in the lead.
we are winning this thing because we're focused.
let's stay that way, okay?
don't let anything else distract us. Please?
Ellie, I'm not gonna get distracted. Now gimme the damn phone.
Ellie, I'm not asking you.
so, what? You're ordering me? - That's right. Now give me the phone.
well, guess what? I'm not in a gosh darn army! - Hey!
get it yourself.
who is it? - Your mother.
you're supposed to be with her next weekend.
she probably wants to know when you're arriving.
I'll deal with it later. - Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.
she doesn't really want me to come.
probably just calling with some bogus reason why I shouldn't.
now, Violet, that isn't true.
your mother loves her time with you.
dad, please. She is so happy in San Jose with Herbert and the nanobot twins.
think she really enjoys that reminder twice a month of the family she left behind?
Yes.
well, I mean, no.
that's not how she thinks about it. About you, anyway.
well, unless the finish line is in northern california, I can't go.
what am I gonna say? "Barbara, Violet can't visit because we're in a secret, illegal road race?
but don't worry, it's perfectly safe. The car only does 85.
I don't think so. - I know.
but I-I... I can't lie. - No, you got that right.
I'm glad you see it that way, honey.
cause that would be setting a terrible example to set for you.
no, dad, you can't lie because she'll see right through you.
you're like the worst liar in the world.
but you could be taught.
Tifton, Georgia 248 miles to checkpoint
I'm gonna get something to eat. You want anything?
no, I'm good. Pre-packaged only! Don't order nothing they gotta cook.
we're in, we're out.
Hey. Hi.
Wow. Hello there yellow bird.
that's what I was calling you out there on the road.
you know, to myself. In my mind.
cause of the way you were gliding along in that big car of yours.
all right. Okay.
so, uh, what's up? I'm winston.
Dupree. - Dupree. like that. It's a nice ride.
looks like you need some help, though.
Yeah. Um, something's wrong with her. Would you?
Yeah. Okay.
credit that to me for forcing her to keep up with a certain yellow bird.
you were trying to keep up, huh?
Yeah. It's a long drive and most of the scenery's pretty dull.
I like to have something pretty to look at.
well, Dupree, see what we got here.
coolant level looks all right.
when's the last time you checked the oil?
never.
how would I do that?
well, first you gotta find the... - dipstick?
think I just did. - What the...?
I'm apprehending you for failure to observe the terms of your Parole in the state of Maryland.
do not resist or I'll be forced to, you know, hurt you.
you a bounty hunter?
fugitive recovery agent, thanks.
Hey. What's going on?
sir, this is official business. Do not interfere.
she's a bounty hunter, bro. - Fugitive recovery agent.
she's saying i jumped parole. - Not me saying it.
it's the state of Maryland.
wait. - Stay back.
do what she says, man. It's all right. No sweat.
the keys are in the car. You get in and you drive.
you got till sundown, remember?
Hey. Sean? For what it's worth, man, I didn't do it.
do what?!
that one was his first love, before he met Katherine.
72 dodge challenger.
he raced professionally?
semi. But that was a lifetime ago.
a man doesn't keep photos of his first love on his mantle unless there's still something there.
there's not, trust me.
his wife make him give it up?
no. He had left that life long before he met Kathryn.
what life?
look, detective, I, I know how this looks to you.
it's your job to be suspicious, but he's out there right now looking for her. I know it.
Alex would never do anything to hurt Katherine.
she's the one who put him back together she made him Alex again.
so when your bother isn't alex, Mrs. Freeman, who is he really?
I'm Alex Tully.
I'm not a getaway driver.
I run a landscaping business in Nebraska.
Yeah, you keep saying that and I'm getting tired of hearing it.
I want the truth. - And I want a lawyer.
it's obvious you don't have any proof to back up your accusations.
you can't just keep me here. - Oh, but I'm not.
what?
I'm not keeping you here, Alex. How can I?
you're not here. Just like you weren't in Ashland, Kentucky in July of 2003.
you haven't been arrested. You haven't been booked, and nobody saw you coming through that front door.
so. Like I said. You're not here.
that's impossible.
I'm telling you, ma'am, there's nothing in the system.
no reports of anyone by the name of Alex Tully being taken into custody today.
well, he was. Where is officer Poole?
we're still looking. - He assaulted Mr. Tully very seriously.
could he have taken him to the hospital?
we're checking on that, too, but we woulda heard.
look, I need to find my friend.
we need to be on the road.
it is absolutely vital that we make it to Rome, Georgia, before it gets dark.
and associates. How can I help you?
this is Sean Salazar. Let me speak to Esteban Masferrer right away.
I'm sorry, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Masferrer is in west Palm all day in meetings.
would you like to leave a message?
Yes. Tell him I'm at a Preston's 40 miles north of the Georgia border.
tell him he has exactly 45 minutes to meet me here or there's gonna be a problem.
I'm sorry, all right? Now, come on.
not till I find that phone.
forget about the phone, we'll get a new one.
I'm not going anywhere till I got it in my hands.
we have to get back in the car.
rob, we're going to lose our lead.
our lead?
is that what matters to you?
we worked hard to get in the front.
I don't think that we should just throw that away!
is that all you really care about is this stupid race?
no. I care about us. More than you, I guess.
what's that supposed to mean?
you married me, but you love the army, your buddies in Iraq, your buddies on the base.
they're all you talk about! All you care about.
those men are my brothers!
where they're at right now you can't even imagine.
they're out there, they're getting shot at, they're getting blown up.
Yeah, I think about them, and I ain't gonna apologize for that.
and I love them!
and I ain't gonna apologize for that either.
great, Ellie. It's busted.
this whole thing, Ellie... this... this race.
this is just money!
I know. I got it in my head that if we won...
what? If we won, what?
that you would never have to go back.
and I know it's unrealistic.
and you would never turn your back on the guys in your unit.
that's why you're such a good man, and why I love you.
I just love you so much.
I don't...
I don't want you to die.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I know this is hard on you, too.
I promise you, it's going to be okay.
maybe we should find a pay phone so you can call.
we'll find one in Rome.
you certain about where you say your truck got stranded?
Yes. I am certain.
there's no truck.
what do you mean, there's no truck?
then it was towed. It wasn't running.
well, not towed by us.
maybe we'll get this all sorted out now. Here's officer Poole.
Jared, you pick up a motorist called "Alex Tully" today?
no.
outside Cecil, Georgia 271 miles to checkpoint a first-rate lie is detailed without being too detailed, you know?
it's close enough to the truth that you can remember it, but it's simple.
I'm concerned you've given this so much thought, dear.
okay, you know what? Let's try an exercise.
imagine you're a 16-year-old girl. - Okay.
okay. And there's this concert that you're, like, dying to go to, but it's on a school night so you know your dad won't let you go.
so what do you say to him so you will?
well, I'd start off by saying how important this concert is to me, and how much I...
No! No! Truth is death!
he will never let you go with that.
all right, you got to lie.
you got to lie like your life depends on it.
pretend I'm him, okay? So say, - "dad..." - dad...
I, uh... I have to... study... tonight...
in the library for A... test?
Yeah. You know, that would work...
if this were 1950, and I had just had a lobotomy-- try again.
well, what would you do?
all right, maybe if I gave you an example.
Oh, okay. Remember, last year, when I told you that Sophie Kramer had gotten dumped by that guy, and he also had given her an std, so she and I were going to check out that support group called teen girls considering celibacy in Eagle Rock?
that was a lie?
you didn't think so at the time.
you brought home literature from that meeting.
Yeah, cause it's all in the details.
I can't believe... what did you do that night?
dad, you're missing the point, okay?
the point is to examine the technique and make it your own.
go ahead and try one.
nice to be able tostretch our legs, huh?
Oh, let me. You've been doing all thdriving.
Oh, thank you.
want to run in and grab us some munchies?
okay. Okay.
uh... Wendy?
credit card?
sorry.
you want anything special or...?
just get a variety. - Okay.
Preston's "Your home on the highway."
you know, I actually worked in one of these when I first came to this country?
have you tried the pecan log? Surprisingly good.
boy, he's nothing like you. - I'm sorry?
just thinking about dad always calls you his other son.
and here it turns out he actually has another son.
my real brother. - Your half-brother.
how long have you known?
what am I saying?
you been cleaning up dad's crap for him ever since he put you through law school.
your father's a very generous man, Sean.
no one knows that better than your half-brother.
my half-brother has a name.
it's Winston. - Sean, let's go home.
your father would like very much to sit down with you, and your mother's frantic. She thought you might have been abducted.
I wasn't abducted, but my brother was.
right outside these doors.
he was taken away in handcuffs about an hour ago.
the parole situation in Maryland, I suspect.
no. You don't suspect. You know.
because the reason the bounty hunter found us on a georgia highway is that you tipped her off.
the situation your half-brother finds himself in is one of his own making.
neither I nor your father have put him there. - No. I did.
this is my fault.
it was the credit cards, right?
that's why dad didn't have you cancel them.
you were using them to track us.
I want him released, Esteban.
that's impossible. This is a criminal matter.
there's nothing I can do. - Bounty hunters aren't cops.
until she turns him over, he's still in play.
but if that happens, dad's lost a son.
and I don't mean Winston. I'm serious.
you'd cut off your own father for the sake of this half-brother you just met two days ago?
he must have worked quite a spell.
I want him released, Esteban.
you have 20 minutes to decide.
I'll be heading up north, waiting for your call.
guess you'll have to pick up the check.
a declaration of independence, Sean?
20 minutes.
the truth, Alex.
just tell the truth, and this can all be over.
you want me to confess to a felony. How does that make anything over?
well, the... the running will be over. The running from who you really are.
I told you who I really am.
all right.
maybe you just need a little time for quiet reflection.
so I want you to look at that man, hmm?
really look at him.
you figure out who it is, eh?
and, maybe, by the time I get back...
wait.
okay.
you want the truth? I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.
truth is...
I can't stop running.
I got to keep going.
if I don't get out of this room, and to Rome, Georgia, before dark, there's every chance they're going to kill my wife.
I can't tell you why.
I can't even tell you who has her. I'm not even sure.
but that's the truth, and that's the only truth.
if I thought confessing to these crimes would help save her, I'd do it.
I would confess to anything.
but you have got to let me go.
well, it's about time! - What?
the only way you're going to save your wife is to win the race.
who are you? - No. That's...not... the... question.
the question is, who are you?
what is going on?
this pantywaist landscaper from Nebraska?
you really think he's got a shot?
no, Alex. No. This guy!
this is the guy that we want! This is the guy that you need to be again.
the road gets longer. The road gets harder.
there's going to be things required of you, things that this landscaper never even dreamed of!
and just driving fast is the least of it.
though you are gonna have to do that, too.
so I just got a selection.
some people are allergic to nuts.
we should probably write down what we're allergic to, you know, in case of...
what are you doing?
I'm making some room to stretch out.
this thing's taking up so much space.
put it back. - What?
that is Sam's car seat. Put it back.
Sam ain't here.
you need to put it back.
you really, really need to put it back.
and then you need to never touch it again, ever. Okay?
okay, yeah. No problem.
great.
I hope you like caramel.
mom?
okay, you can do it, dad.
barbara, how are you? Sorry to keep you in the dark.
I got a last-minute invitation to a conference in Seattle and decided to bring Vi with me.
we're driving past the Puget sound now.
you should see it--it's beautiful.
good detail, huh?
anyway, I was wondering if she could stay here with me next weekend, instead of coming up to San Jose.
we'll make it up next month, I promise.
Really? That's wonderful, barbara.
thanks so much.
John, I don't understand what you're saying.
I called because your work said you'd left town, and I wanted to make sure you had enough meds while you were traveling.
Yeah, the Space Needle. Right!
they're the only thing buying you time right now.
you've got to keep up with them, you understand?
right. Okay. No problem, Barbara.
John? - Call anytime.
dad, that was great!
I mean, honestly, even I couldn't tell that you were making that up.
well, I, uh...
I had a great teacher.
so this whole thing was a lie.
getting to a deeper truth.
who you really are.
I don't understand-- if somebody's telling me to go faster, this is a pretty strange way to do it-- pulling me off the road.
well, you were already off the road.
you were on the side of it.
so if this is about giving me a car, why not just give me the car?
why go to all this?
I needed to make that checkpoint before dark.
well, you still can.
old Alex Tully-- the real Alex Tully
he'd be there already.
Where's the girl? Where's Corinna?
you forget her-- she's only holding you back.
save one damsel at a time-- save your wife.
leave the other one to us.
Rome before dark, huh?
police escort couldn't hurt.
I ain't the police.
and this ain't my car. - What?
well, you did a good job, but...
it's not the same car. It's not mine.
it's the same car. Nope. If it were...
guess it is mine. Where's Corinna?
did you learn anything?
would the real Alex Tully waste time asking that question?
the real Alex Tully never left his partners behind.
and you don't want to meet the real Alex Tully. Promise.
now, where is she?
get in!
what's going on? - Buckle up.
I don't know who you got to, but he's big.
first time I had to throw one back.
one thing you should know:
I'm not the only one out there looking for you.
keep your eyes in the rearview.
good luck, guys.
you can thank me later. We got to go.
figure we got two hours to make it to rome.
you mind if I drive? I'm starting to like this car.
keys. - Come on, give me an hour.
keys. Or I'll take 'em from you.
okay. Whatever.
Rome, GEORGIA what happened back there? What did they do to you?
they didn't do it to me, they did it to some other guy.
Where'd you get this car? - Same guy's car. Hang on.
after SUNSET
welcome, drivers.
Congratulations--you have made it to the after sunset, but before dark.
we know you have questions.
for answers before you.
this is something... you're gonna wanna see.
help me!
semper Fortis.
mom, you said if I came over we could watch a movie!
no, I said if you finished your homework.
come on, it's too hard! - I know, I know, but I swear, you will use it for everything.
really. Especially if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer.
I don't want to be either of those.
okay. What do you want to be?
a fashion designer.
semper fortis.
always... something.
Oh. Must be your father.
already?
Hey.
Hello, Todd.
thanks for watching her. - Anytime.
come on, kiddo. Let's go.
see you, Megan.
Thanks, mom.
I'm sorry about the movie.
maybe we can do it this weekend.
I can't. I'm going to Boston with dad and Kate.
well, then, um...
next weekend.
okay.
let me get this straight. This tall? You're sure?
man, she took a real beating.
then some soulless bastard dumps her out here.
well, that's if she was dumped.
a guy walking his dog came across the body - and Mr. Meth Head over there going through her pockets. - What do you want me to say?!
Hey, settle down.
liver temp and rigor puts T. O.D.
between 5: 00 and 7: 00 PM yesterday.
no obvious fatal trauma.
no strangulation. No stab wounds.
nice compound fracture of the tibia, though.
how hard would you have to hit someone to do that?
never underestimate the power of meth.
detective Morris, good to see you.
Dr. Hunt. Nice tennis shoes. Very C. S.A.
crime scene appropriate.
you get an I. D. on this girl yet?
no. My newfound friend dookie over here isn't gonna...
tell us anything till he lands back on planet earth.
well, this looks like it could be a handprint.
I'm thinking she and dookie came out here to get high.
he tries to take advantage. She fights back.
well, it's what's on the inside that counts, right, doctor?
I'll let you know what I get out of Rocket Man.
bud was almost in a good mood.
his wife let him back in the house.
what is with those shoes anyway?
I'm not wearing heels. So?
well, that's a first.
maybe my mind was on other things.
Lacey is going to Boston this weekend...
with Todd and Kate.
he didn't even consult me.
a whole weekend with his new girlfriend, who, by the way, just also happens to be my...
your boss.
good morning, Dr. Murphy.
I understand we've got a dumped body.
we're not sure if it was dumped or not.
great. This area's supposed to be family friendly.
I already have the city tourist board calling me.
and here I was, concerned about a woman who was beaten to death. Hmm.
you know that for a fact? - Not yet.
well, until you do, I'm consulting.
send me the X-rays as soon as you have 'em.
go, team.
okay, folks, I have a brief statement.
the body of a woman was found this morning.
we have no I. D. at this time.
who was she, dookie?
I don't know who she is.
I already told you.
who was she?
I don't know.
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!
knock it off. Knock it off. Knock it off!
you know what I think?
I think you two were getting high.
things got out of hand.
you dragged her off the path into those godforsaken woods.
you took her money, and you beat her to death.
No! I told you, when I tripped is when I first saw her body, but she was dead already.
is that before or after you shot up?
Jane Doe, approximately 30 years old.
no obvious cause of death.
severe abrasions on the right side.
compound fracture of the left tibia.
how big was the guy who did this?
if it's the guy from the scene, about Ethan's size with the added bonus of meth.
uh, meth gives you superhuman strength.
it does not make you stronger.
it just makes you feel like you are.
it blocks the brain's pain receptors so the muscles operate beyond fatigue.
and she has a tattoo on her left wrist of four horses.
of the apocalypse?
four little horses, and you go apocalypse?
well, horses are scary, and there's four of 'em.
those don't look like badass, scary horses to me.
those are nice horses.
horses are never nice.
if you don't mind, there is something written beneath the horses.
thank you.
and she has glitter on her lips.
presumably from her lipstick.
are you sure she wasn't a user?
there's no evidence of xerostomia.
Why? - There's white powder under her nails.
is that cocaine?
huh. Maybe Bud was right, and our victim and her attacker were doing drugs together.
or not.
forensics found a D. N.A. match in Codis to the bloody handprint.
we have a new suspect, sort of.
sort of?
Zoe Brant. She's doing four to seven years in County.
how do you kill someone if you're already behind bars?
serving four to seven for nearly beating your drug dealer to death.
but good behavior got you, uh, horse therapy at Grass Hill Stables two days a week.
Yeah, so?
Oh, my God. That's Bryn.
does Bryn have a last name?
Yeah. Bryn Walker. She started the program.
what happened to her?
you tell us. That's your blood on her shirt.
wait. You think I did this? I got cut yesterday.
a horse kicked me to the ground. Bryn helped me up.
that part of the therapy, getting knocked to the ground?
Bryn used horses to help us learn how to control our emotions, how to be more sensitive.
and what emotions do you think made that horse want to kick you in the head?
uh, pain. I was bandaging the horse's leg.
uh, Bryn was teaching me to be a veterinary assistant.
Wow. That's a long road.
I'm out in three months. I've got a little girl, and I want to be able to take care of her.
what's your little girl's name?
none of your business.
Wow. That horse therapy's really working for you, Zoe.
we'll be in touch.
let's go.
Zoe tried to escape, Bryn got in the way.
why would she escape? She's out in three months.
cause she's a felon and a user.
you saw those track marks.
Yeah, I saw them. They were old.
it may be hard for you to comprehend, detective, but users do get clean.
people can change. Bryn Walker believed that.
maybe, but she wouldn't be the first person who got killed by giving a felon a second chance.
anything on those X-rays to give us cause of death?
not found yet.
these injuries are all remote. Maybe a couple of years old.
shattered her right ankle, broken clavicle, broke her arm a couple of times.
those are riding injuries she must have competed.
that would be an understatement.
Bryn was a champion equestrian.
she won a competition just a few days ago.
and I think I've solved the mystery about her tattoo.
the only family she has was her brother, Andrew.
he died in prison.
PA-1302 was his prison I. D. number.
if you can't save the ones you love, save everyone else. - What about the four horses?
of the apocalypse, right? - What is it with you guys?
it's the four horsemen of the apocalypse, not the horses.
I also got the blood test back.
uh, Bryn wasn't a recent user, and she didn't O. D.
and we still don't have an I. D.
of that white powder from her nails.
there is no way this woman met up with a meth head to get high.
is there anything besides the blood to implicate Zoe?
not unless she picked Bryn up by the foot and swung her around.
Tib-fib spiral fractures.
usually you see this around machinery accidents, like if a limb gets stuck in something and twisted.
there was no machinery around the crime scene.
you know what?
spiral fractures, contusions on one side...
I think that Bryn got her foot caught in her stirrup.
she was dragged by a horse.
a riding accident?
no, I find that hard to believe.
and why is that, Mr. Brooks?
ms. Walker was a pro.
did she often ride without a helmet?
Nope, but I only manage this place.
but I can tell you, she only rode one horse, and there he is, no worse for wear.
first class champion.
Shh. Ooh, it's okay. It's all right.
well, I don't see any saddle marks or sweat stains.
this horse hasn't been ridden in a while.
you know horses?
I used to ride. My daughter has the bug now.
Really? 'Cause I... I buy and sell on the side if you're ever in the market.
Bryn had a tattoo with four horses.
sure she doesn't ride any other horse?
not that I know of.
well, thank you very much for your time, Mr. Brooks.
no problem.
you know, if you're ever in the market.
did you see the way this horse flinched when he touched him?
so?
so Zoe's right.
horses are very sensitive to people.
one false move...
so we're still looking for the horse Bryn fell off of.
I'll make some calls, see if anybody in Philly has a missing horse in their backyard.
hello.
lace, hi. It's me.
what are you doing later?
the lower half of both Bryn's lungs collapsed.
Megan hasn't sectioned them yet?
she set aside the lungs for Ethan.
well, Ethan's not here, and Megan's still at the stable, so I'll do it.
well, we still don't have C. O.D.
hand me the scissors.
Thanks.
what?
first you're consulting, and now you're dissecting?
Mnh-mnh. You're never this helpful.
Todd and I are taking Lacey to Boston for the weekend.
well, being helpful isn't gon' help.
Thanks.
wait. What is that?
what is that?
looks like some kind of undigested food.
how'd that get in her lungs?
why are we doing this?
Megan thinks that Bryn falling off a horse had something to do with her death.
it would help to find some evidence that she was actually riding one.
this is definitely not in my job description.
you and me both。
I got hoofprints here.
Oh. I've got crap.
well, keep looking.
no, seriously. I've got crap.
okay.
is that...
Yep. Manure.
horse was definitely here.
we're done.
you know, horses give me the creeps.
it all goes back to my childhood, when I was younger, and my... my gramps wouldn't let us watch cartoons.
we would have to watch reruns of "Mister Ed," you know, with his lips and his teeth moving.
it was like a nightmare.
Hey, Ethan. - Huh?
I think we found our horse.
Wow. This riding vest inflates when you fall.
look, it's got a drawstring. You attach it to the saddle, and then when you fall off the horse...
I thought we were shopping for my trip.
why would we need to shop for your trip?
what kind of trip is this? - A lame one.
you don't want to go?
Emily's birthday is on Saturday, and she's having a huge party.
but instead, I get to be the third wheel with dad and Kate.
does your father know about this?
he doesn't care.
maybe you could talk to him?
maybe you could wear this vest?
mom, I know what I'm doing on a horse.
Lacey, a woman fell off her horse yesterday and died.
she was a very good rider, but her foot still got caught in the stirrup.
you're getting this vest. - I don't see how her foot could've gotten caught in her stirrup...
...because most riders I know...
use saddles with safety stirrups.
see, when you fall, the sidebar detaches, and your foot comes out.
Hey, Ethan and I found this horse out by the crime scene.
Bryn's name is on the saddle.
Where's Ethan? - Uh, therapy.
what is going on, Dr. Hunt?
detective Morris, this is my daughter, Lacey.
what the hell? Is this "bring your daughter to work day"?
watch your language. She's only 12.
I'm almost 12 1/2.
Mr. Brooks, it appears that Bryn rode more than one horse.
uh, it must be one of the misfits she used with her prisoners.
Lacey, you're up.
it's okay. - It's okay.
these kind of saddles are made with safety stirrups.
see, if you fall, and your foot gets caught, you don't get dragged 'cause it releases...
...but this one is broken.
see, it's supposed to release like this.
uh, maybe it got stuck in the accident.
Oh, right. Horse did it all by himself.
this isn't broken.
these scratches look like tool marks.
someone's tampered with this stirrup.
Bryn's saddle was sabotaged.
this is, uh, Bryn's storage shed.
well, open it.
excuse me. Will, what are you doing?
this is police business, sir.
this is private property.
you don't go in there without Bryn's permission.
Bryn's dead.
what?
he's Bryn's boyfriend.
keep him busy for a while.
I want to see what's in that shed.
sure.
Mr. Savage...
I'm very sorry that you had to find out this way.
how long were you and Bryn together?
about a year.
we, uh, met at a competition.
just moved in together.
why didn't you call the police when Bryn didn't come home?
she was here at the stable.
overnight?
Yeah. There's a couch in the office.
sometimes she would stay there if she had to work late.
the prisoner program required a ton of paperwork.
did Bryn ever mention having a fight with one of the other prisoners?
no, why?
it seems somebody sabotaged her saddle.
anyone else at the stable have a problem with Bryn?
Yeah. It's that creep who works here.
Yeah. He made some passes at her.
he... he wouldn't let her alone.
Where's my mom? - Crap.
don't sneak up on people with guns, kid.
didn't your mom tell you to wait in the car?
didn't she tell you to watch your language?
all right. Go do what she said.
you do what she said. - You do what she said.
you do what she said.
you have no idea what that stuff is, do you?
I'll figure it out.
it's a hoof pick.
cleans their feet.
Wow. Look at these ribbons.
do you know what it takes to be this kind of a champion rider?
a horse, for starters?
it's all about discipline and awareness, of yourself and your horse.
it's a lot about communication...
when to take control and when to ease up on the reins.
Oh, listen to you. A mini-Megan.
you don't like my mom much, do you?
Oh, I like her fine.
she's like liver. Six days a week is a little much.
I wouldn't know.
these look all right to you?
Yeah.
your mom's looking for you back at the car.
Hey. You find anything out from our friend?
well, it seems that Will Brooks may have wanted a little bit more than just the keys to Bryn's shed, if you know what I mean.
I don't get it.
uh... ask your mom.
Yeah. - I don't mean sex.
I mean, how does an expert rider fall off her horse?
I understand you have Bryn's file.
Yeah. I... I might have a lead on her C. O.D.
I found a piece of broccoli in her right lung that was macerated with stomach juices.
you did? - Yes, I know. Sorry.
it's your body, but you were at the stable, - and Ethan was not here. - Why are you taking Lacey to Boston?
I am not taking her anywhere. Todd is.
with you.
Megan, I'm not trying to replace you.
could I have the file, please?
so I just won't go, then. - Yes, you will.
Megan... - Her heart is normal.
blood work, too.
so how did the contents of her stomach end up in her lungs?
a blow to the abdomen? Maybe the fall off the horse?
Yes, but what made her fall off the horse...
and cause food to get in her lungs and both lower lobes to collapse?
it has to be a drug.
but you said yourself, her blood work was normal.
tox screens don't catch everything.
if there is...
an injection site, it would have to be in the abraded area.
otherwise, we would've found it earlier.
maybe someplace where she didn't feel it.
the soft tissue. Her hip.
there is a bump here.
there has to be an entry point.
you took Lacey to a crime scene?
I think he's here to see me.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm... just... just give me one minute.
Yeah. I'll take the sample to the lab.
okay, I'll...
Lacey calls me talking about... about sabotaged saddles and... and dead horse riders.
where is she, by the way?
in my office doing homework.
any killers in there?
at least I'm not taking her away for the weekend with my new girlfriend.
why are you doing that?
she has heart set on going to that party.
Yeah, that party is being chaperoned by Emily's brother, by the way. He's 17.
which I would've known if I had any say in my daughter's life.
you gave that up five years ago.
I didn't give up being her mother.
why don't you just let her stay with me this weekend?
no. No way. I'm taking her home, Megs.
uh, results on the powder under Bryn's fingernails...
traces of oat bran and sugar and phenylbutazone, also known as...
bute. It's a... a horse pain reliever.
it's...
it, um...
it sounds like she put it in some kind of mash to feed the horse.
uh, that's not all.
you know, uh, that jumping competition she won a few days ago?
a horse was disqualified for having too much bute in its system.
whose horse?
the boyfriend... James Savage.
you think that she buted his horse to get him disqualified?
well, maybe Bryn's not as squarely clean as we thought.
you and Bryn were rivals.
see, I didn't know that, uh, horseback riding was the only olympic competition where men and women competed equally.
and she has been kicking your ass.
you've come in second ten times in the last two years to her...
the Privy Invitational, Grosspoint Grand, East Coast Summit.
she drugs your horse. You get disqualified.
she ends up dead.
I didn't kill Bryn. That is absurd.
detective, do you know why you're only allowed to give a small amount of bute for a competition?
no, doctor. Why?
because if it needs bute, that means it's injured.
and making a horse compete like that would be inhumane.
Mr. Savage, we both know Bryn was not the kind of person to bute a horse before a competition.
bute is administered orally.
if it gets on your hands, it can cause skin irritation.
you buted your own horse, didn't you?
the only thing I ever put on my horse during competition was coat shine.
I make it myself, and it's legal.
let's see. Show me your hands.
Why? - I'm gonna test you for bute.
don't you need a warrant? - Sure.
and when we get one, we'll have one for your trailer and your car, your horse, your computer.
anything on there you don't want us to find?
okay. I buted my own horse.
we're all looking for an edge.
but I didn't kill Bryn.
what I don't get it if Pagliacci here buted his own horse, then why is it on Bryn's hand?
did you find any in the shed?
no. Then again, why don't you ask your daughter?
she's like you. She's a know-it-all, too.
she should've stayed in the car.
I think she just misses you.
Why?
what?
did she say something?
look, I... I don't know kids. I just...
she seems like she wants to spend more time with you.
I told her she was nuts.
what is it?
preliminary lab report.
Bryn was injected with succinylcholine bromide.
a little slower please.
it's a paralytic that vets use to put horses down.
Ah. Now we're back to Zoe.
she was training to be a veterinary's assistant.
to provide for her daughter.
I'll send some guys out to the stables and see if there's a veterinary kit with some missing, uh...
succinylcholine bromide.
why would she kill Bryn? She was trying to help Zoe.
Why? Look at your own evidence.
the drug, the blood on Bryn's shirt, access to the saddle...
all roads lead to Zoe.
you're the one who's always talking about the body as proof.
what is it telling you?
asphyxiation by succinylcholine.
that's what killed Bryn.
there's a vial missing, and your fingerprints are all over that box.
outgoing phone records from the stable office.
somebody was calling your family.
Bryn caught you using the phone, didn't she?
threatened to take away your privileges, - bounce you out of the program... - That's not what happened.
a guard saw you arguing with Bryn outside the office an hour before she was killed.
we were arguing because I wanted her to stop calling my mother.
Bryn was making those calls? - Yeah.
she was trying to convince my mom to let my kid see me.
why would that make you angry?
my mom gave up on me a long time ago.
I appreciate what Bryn was trying to do, but you can't convince someone you've changed if they don't want to believe it.
why are your fingerprints on the box?
Bryn asked me to put that box back in the cabinet.
she'd just stopped someone from trying to put a horse down.
who? - I don't know.
some guy who doesn't like horses.
she, uh, she wouldn't say anymore.
Uh-huh. And this, uh, this horse, what did it look like?
I don't know. It was a white one.
it, uh, it was new to the stable, had an injured front leg.
you're sure the horse was white?
Yeah.
excuse me, detective.
uh, I'm Zoe Brant's mother.
you wanted to speak to me.
Oh, yes. Thanks for coming in.
uh... who is this?
this is Zoe's daughter, Laila.
Hi. - Hi.
that's pretty.
no, sweetie. Um, Laila, come... come by grandma.
thank you.
um... Mrs. Brant, have you ever talked to a woman named Bryn Walker?
what were you eating?
man, this is weird.
it looks like the horse digested some kind of metallic substance.
what is that smell?
well, I just spent an hour with the white horse trying to figure out why someone would want to kill him.
and, uh, I'm now keen-deep in horse poop.
maybe it's the horse poop.
did you find anything apart from metal in his...
Yeah, he was sick with colic.
and I found bute in his whiskers mixed in with oat bran...
oat bran and sugar.
Yes.
so Bryn was taking care of a sick horse.
but that doesn't explain why she was riding a horse she didn't own.
those are the horse's veterinary files.
I found a brand on the horse and then tracked down the owner.
any connection to Bryn? - Mm-hmm. Will Brooks.
the guy bought the horse from him, and then returned it because it didn't perform well.
this horse was supposed to compete?
you were a little, um, hard on Megan yesterday, don't you think?
Yeah. Sorry to get you involved in all that.
you kinda crossed that line when you invited Lacey to spend the weekend with us.
see, you didn't know the old Megan, okay?
she wasn't always this attentive.
so she's changed. - Yeah.
maybe she deserves a break.
whose side are you on?
ours. Listen...
we are great together.
true.
but this isn't about us.
I think maybe you invited Lacey for the weekend because... you're afraid of letting go.
no, no. Uh, you don't understand.
my parents were divorced.
I know what it's like to be stuck in the middle.
sorry.
just make sure this is about Lacey and not... about your own stuff.
okay? I gotta go. Thanks.
Yeah.
Bryn told Zoe that she stopped somebody from putting down a horse.
so maybe that led to putting down Bryn?
we figure out what's wrong with that horse, maybe we can isolate Bryn's killer.
well, I mean, I'm no veterinarian, but just looking at these X-rays, I can tell you, he's got arthritis, hyperostosis, deterioration of the skeleton.
I mean, this is an old horse.
will Brooks sold it as a show horse.
I mean, why would he think it could compete?
check out the teeth.
it looks like somebody filed them down and filled them with something.
so that's why the horse flinched.
will must have had silver nitrate on his hands.
come again?
it's called bishoping.
it's this horrible process where they use silver nitrate to alter the shape of the teeth to make the horse look younger.
and then sell it at a higher price.
so maybe Bryn discovered that Brooks was bishoping horses.
and then he killed Bryn to shut her up.
what are you searching through my stuff for?
I thought a prisoner killed Bryn.
Yeah, well, she wasn't bishoping horses, was she? Keep an eye on him.
horses freak me out, but I feel for them, knowing guys like that exist.
Hey, I got something.
huh?
succinylcholine, empty.
well, Wilbur, we just need to find the syringe.
you feel better now you got that out?
Oh, yeah.
much better.
Bryn was planning on going to the authorities.
that's why you sabotaged her saddle and shot her full of that drug.
I didn't kill Bryn, okay? We had a deal.
what deal?
she caught me. Okay.
I promised to stop bishoping horses if she kept quiet, and in return, I would give all the old horses to her therapy program.
you would just give her all the horses?
that, or I could sell 'em for dog food.
Wow. You really are a poster child for animal rights. - I kept my end.
I stayed out all night helping her with the damn horse.
helping her how? - It had colic, so you have to keep it moving.
you have to keep walking it.
and the last time I saw this, it was in Bryn's hand.
come on. I swear to you.
somebody set me up.
I'll hold him on animal cruelty, but for the murder, I need confirmation on the drug.
we'll get it to the lab right now.
any chance that Zoe set Will up?
I don't think so. I talked to Zoe's mother.
it was Bryn calling her from the stable office, not Zoe.
Why?
well, Bryn wanted Zoe to see her daughter so they could connect before she got out.
and the mother was against that?
you can't convince somebody you've changed if they don't want to believe you.
Zoe said that. - And her mother didn't buy it.
she's on the fence.
what do you think, detective?
4 horses... 8. 9 million results"?
my God.
Oh. Who are you here to see?
uh, you.
can you hang on?
this will just take a second, all right?
what?
I thought about it, and... I think Lacey should stay with you this weekend.
okay. Great.
because I've been doing some thinking, too, and I want to be more involved in her life.
from now on, I want her every other weekend.
I extend an olive branch, you want the whole tree.
I think Lacey would want me to... - Megan.
no, Megan, Megan...
hold that thought. - Yeah, sure. I'll do that.
hello.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Oh, no, no. Do not look at me like that.
same old Megan. - No, I'm not.
what I am done is trying to prove myself to you.
and that was Lacey. You're late to pick her up.
what? I can't...
I gotta go. I... I will talk to you later.
I gotta... wow.
Todd was just here.
he had to leave to pick up Lacey, otherwise I'm sure he would've come by to say hello.
it's fine, Megan.
he doesn't have to see me every time he comes to see you.
that's very adult of you.
well, I don't imagine I'm gonna lose him to you, am I?
no, he's all yours.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
well, at least for the weekend.
Lacey's staying with me.
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
listen, I know Todd.
I know, this kind of decision, he didn't get there without someone kicking him in the...
so...
you're actually here to thank me?
what I'm trying to say is...
that you're sorry...?
there may have been times when I took my anger at Todd out on you, and...
I'm really bad at this.
Oh, for God sake. Just say it.
okay. I'm sorry and thank you.
now see? Was it that hard?
Yes, Curtis.
we've got a problem.
I checked the amount of succinylcholine left in the syringe Ethan found.
is this right?
she didn't get enough to kill her.
there was enough succinylcholine in Bryn's system to paralyze her, but not enough to kill her.
she was still alive lying in that ravine?
that's cold.
so what stopped her breathing?
I assumed the manure at the crime scene came from the white horse, so I ran his D. N.A. against it to double-check.
it wasn't a match.
Ethan, we're trying to solve a murder.
go take your 4-H project somewhere else.
don't you get it?
the manure wasn't from the horse that Bryn was riding, Sherlock.
so someone else rode a different horse out to the crime scene.
Yes, and he ate something shiny.
glitter.
somehow he ingested it.
why would a horse eat glitter?
he wouldn't.
we found glitter on Bryn at autopsy.
traces of it on her lips.
so she ate it, too?
no, she didn't eat anything.
she inhaled it.
the glitter was on the killer's hands that's what made her stop breathing.
he suffocated her.
why would a horseback rider have glitter on his hands?
to win.
hey there.
Hi.
could you get off the horse, please, Mr. Savage?
off the horse, please.
Hi.
you give your horse every advantage, don't you?
numb its pain with drugs, coat shine on his nose to make it all shiny.
we found it in Bryn's eyes and nose.
your own special brand, remember?
you forgot it was on your glove when you suffocated her.
that's crazy. Why would I do that?
jealousy.
I saw the phone records from the stable office the night before Bryn died.
you called there repeatedly. You thought she was with Will.
you were right.
making all those times that she beat you in competition feel that much worse.
some men just can't handle that.
but her betrayal gave you the perfect way to get rid of her... pin it on Will.
you sabotaged her saddle, sent her off on her afternoon ride paralyzed with succinylcholine, and then let her horse do the rest.
you put the evidence in Will's shed,
will takes the fall, and then you start winning blue ribbons instead of red.
what happened, James... the horse reared, you didn't get the needle in far enough?
you screwed up. That's why you went out there.
you knew there was a chance she would survive.
you had to go out there to finish her off yourself.
her punishment for being better than you will ever be.
better?
so... she cheats on me with some trailer-park loser, and you think that she's better than me?
Oh, well, you showed her, didn't you?
the thing is, James, she didn't cheat on you.
Yeah, she was with Will, saving a horse's life.
you're under arrest for the murder of Bryn Walker.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be provided for you.
do you understand these rights?
some former prisoners took up a collection.
they're planning a memorial for Bryn.
so she does have a family after all.
any word from Todd?
Yeah.
he's agreed to let me have Lacey every other weekend.
we're telling her tonight.
be careful what you wish for, huh?
I, um, found the four horses, by the way.
it's a discourse by the Buddha.
the Buddha?
the excellent horse moves before the whip touches its back.
the good horse runs at the lightest touch.
the poor horse doesn't move until he feels pain.
and then there's the very bad horse.
he doesn't move until the whip penetrates his marrow.
my car accident...
was my whip.
it broke me.
and it...
brought me back to Lacey.
what if I screw up again?
you won't.
you won't.
we caught Bryn Walker's killer.
and her program's gonna continue, so you'll have a job when you get out.
I appreciate that.
there's one other thing.
Oh, my God.
Hi, baby.
mommy.
you're so beautiful.
so, uh, your mother and I were talking, and... and we were wondering...
if you wanted to stay with her more often.
but it... it's no pressure. If... if... if...
Yeah. - If you don't want to, that's okay, too.
Yeah.
no, no, I... I would like to.
okay.
okay, good. We'll come up with some kind of schedule.
all right? Something you can count on.
maybe every other weekend to start, okay?
does that mean I can stay with mom this weekend?
Yeah, it... sure.
and can I go to the party?
how about...
you and I go see a movie together?
it's a pretty good compromise.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll... I'll check online.
I'll see what the showtimes are.
nice save.
I'm learning.
if you were the Bay Harbor Butcher ,
would you use a place like this?
the conditions in this space don't support his m. O.
maybe the butcher's having an identity crisis.
your brother's a junkie.
are you high? He's never even smoked a cigarette.
looks like Cody 's enjoying himself.
Dexter's very patient with him.
Dexter's a saint.
I hope you could dig up a case file for me got a date?
it's the crime scene when Harry found me
I've been waiting for a chance to take your ass out.
I know how you feel, sergeant.
he crossed the line, lieutenant.
he broke into my lab.
he's probably gonna start tailing me again.
sergeant Doakes tailed you?
I followed him to an n. a. Meeting.
that asshole lied about that, too.
you're obsessed. I'm not.
and I need you to see it!
dinner was fantastic, Rita . Wow.
I kind of like her.
Dex, just calling to check in.
imagine Rita 's face if I told her
that you and I had spent the night together in a hotel.
it's over, Dexter .
I guess I just hope with Lundy it will be different.
Why? I respect him.
you love him.
no. He's like my dad.
you want to tell me what's going on?
you're the one who said I'm supposed to feel my feelings!
well, now I'm telling you to get them under control!
which step was that?
that night, a forest grew
use the entire canvas.
start from the top. Work your way down.
light, feathery strokes.
perfect!
stunning.
try longer strokes now.
perfect.
you really know what you want, don't you?
I hope you don't mind.
some men do.
no.
I've always found instruction manuals...
quite useful.
okay, your turn.
what do you want?
I think that was it.
hmm, come on.
you must have some dark fantasies...
...unfulfilled urges.
I'm pretty good at acting on those.
Really?
then fuck me like that.
your light's burned out.
it's the wiring.
I've been asking my landlord to fix it for weeks.
well, now I can see better.
that's where my landlord lives.
now he'll have to fix it.
see you later.
got to admire Lila for taking things into her own hands.
that includes me.
Ohh. Mom.
come on, let's go! No more moping.
I'm not moping. I'm sleeping.
oversleeping -- third time this week.
the only way you're gonna get over Dexter
is if you take charge of your day.
come on. You're not in high school anymore.
go scrub your face, and I'll heat up some oatmeal.
didn't hear you come in last night.
well, it was late. I was quiet.
Yeah, you're good at quiet.
guess you kind of have to be with me crashing here
and Rita 's mom over there.
you and Rita fuck quiet, too?
and she's off, right out of the gate.
because me -- I wake the goddamn dead.
it's a problem.
Oh, I know, only too well.
scary, right?
sometimes I disturb myself.
so what kind of noises does Rita make?
could we not talk about sex...
or Rita ?
Why?
cause we broke up...
for real.
it's over.
you break up, you get back together
that's just what goes on.
I mean, you and Rita are forever.
just say you're sorry and send some fucking flowers.
you're not hearing me.
look, when all this blows over,
I'll spend a few days at Gabriel 's, and...
you can screw Rita as loud as you want.
big news, Dex .
Whoa! Feel like I got caught in a wave.
the miamI tribune received a 32-page manifesto in the mail.
it's looking good for the Bay Harbor Butcher .
well, I've heard that one before.
look, this may be legit.
the manifesto includes the names of three victims
we never released to the press.
Oh, that is big news.
I'm heading over to the tribune now for special agent Lundy.
he put me in charge of the team.
go, Angel .
Yeah, I'm psyched.
Yeah, me too. I'm about to be published.
I sent that manifesto to the tribune.
guess I've been taking some cues from Lila lately,
and not just in bed.
I'm tired of reacting to the moves of agent Lundy and his super posse.
time to control their actions for a change.
Betsy court, 16. Blunt-force beating.
it looks like she was sunning herself
and never saw it coming.
who called in the body?
Craig Wilson , the stepfather. He's right over there.
Wilson told the reporting officer
that he came home for lunch and found her that way.
um, you and Dexter resolve your issues?
as far as I'm concerned.
Why? The bitch come crying to you again?
no.
there's blood work to be done here,
and if you can't control yourself,
I need to call in another detective.
I won't say anything to hurt the little girl's feelings.
God damn it, James , I'm not joking.
do I look like I'm laughing?
no. You don't. I wish you would. You used to.
bullshit. I never laughed.
Yeah, you know what? You're probably right.
now, look, I'm not gonna try to scare you anymore.
the reality is, you're out of free passes.
now, I already stopped Dexter from filing a complaint against you once.
I never asked you to do that, Maria . well, I did it,
out of my own concern over your obsessive behavior.
now I'm on the line,
so if you bully Dexter in any way
if you even look at him wrong,
I will not be responsible for the fallout.
you got it?
I got it.
you're backing the fucking freaktard.
James.
where you been, Dexter ?
you don't bring me doughnuts.
you don't sing me love songs. How are you, Camilla ?
I've been better.
well, that doesn't sound good.
sergeant Doakes dropped by my file room yesterday.
he requested the case files
for the 1973 shipping-yard murders.
I gave him the same line I gave you when you came sniffing around,
said all that old stuff was boxed up
in the basement of city hall.
that made him real angry.
he scared me, Dexter .
that's not right. He shouldn't do that.
look, Dex , I always assumed that your father asked me to destroy those files to protect you.
now I'm not sure what's going on.
Camilla...
now, I don't want to know.
I just don't want to get fired.
I'm retiring next year. Did I tell you?
I've been looking forward to staying home with Gene .
you won't lose your retirement. I won't let that happen.
I can stall sergeant Doakes for a few days,
but eventually, he'll figure out
that that case file's missing, just like you did.
and he'll track it back to me, you know, just like you did.
I'll take care of this. You have my word.
so much for threatening Doakes .
he won't back off till he exposes the twisted branches of my family tree,
from my father's indiscretions to my murderous brother
to the root of all evil -- me.
why aren't you at the tribune?
what for?
our guy's not gonna leave DNA evidence on a document.
Oh, but the thrill of the hunt.
I've had that particular thrill.
I'll leave it to younger men.
besides, it's easier for me to do my part from here.
yeah? What part is that?
operating on favors, political leanings, posturing.
I've been trying to find the right music.
right.
so, I'm off duty today,
but here are those marina reports.
and after my workout,
I'll swing by and pick up a copy of the manifesto.
look at that board.
these kills are precise, but there's also a fluidity,
even some improvisation.
if I could just find the music...
want to borrow my iPod?
got any Chopin?
no. Fresh out of Chopin.
shit. Chopin's perfect.
did you just swear?
what can I say?
you're rubbing off on me, Morgan .
but Chopin is perfect.
so this is how you do what you do.
the truth speaks to me from a peaceful place.
I got to set the stage to hear it.
you know what I mean?
no.
I thrive on chaos.
but this is good, too.
I didn't kill her.
I was just trying to stop the blood.
just the...
no forceful impact spatter
he's telling the truth. I can tell.
palms up, please.
when I found Betsy , she was still breathing.
I wanted to help her.
you believe me, right?
I'm just the lab guy, Mr. Wilson. Sorry.
arms down at your sides, please.
blood misting. Huh.
I need to collect his shirt for evidence.
Morgan!
the girl's mother was at work,
but she isn't really defending her husband.
Wilson and his stepdaughter fought all the time.
the neighbors heard him yelling at her this morning.
then he comes home for lunch -- motive and opportunity.
What'd the blood say?
well, the blood on his hands could have come
from trying to help her, like he claims.
but I did detect, uh, blood mist on his shirt.
a blood mist
the kind that comes from beating on a teenage girl?
no. Yes.
you're absolutely sure?
it's too fine for a bludgeoning.
the mist is from a bludgeoning.
medium-velocity impact spatters -- no doubt about it.
okay, Morgan .
just make sure you get me your blood report
as soon as possible.
this is my chance to make Doakes go away
without spilling a single drop of his blood.
of course, I have to sell an innocent man down the river.
sorry, Mr. Wilson, but I won't let you float too far.
I was just thinking about you.
hmm. I like the sound of that.
Yeah, I had to do a little creative problem-solving
at someone else's expense.
Bravo.
Yeah, I figured you'd like that.
what's up?
well, you know that art installation that I've been working on?
the cannibals.
they're not cannibals. How barbaric!
their eating is symbolic
of the way we consume others to feed our needs.
that's what I meant.
well, it sold.
I-I didn't even create it to sell, but one of my buyers
fell in love with it, and I named an outrageous price,
and she paid me a deposit on the spot.
so...
you in the mood to celebrate?
definitely.
I'm afraid we just can't seat you tonight without a reservation.
as you can see, we are completely at capacity.
Oh, well
no, I'm sorry. You have to help us.
I made this reservation two months ago.
this is our 10-year anniversary.
this is the place where Dexter proposed to me
on the patio, in front of the fountain.
he told me to make a wish, and when I looked down,
there was my diamond ring, sparkling under the water.
that is so romantic.
in case you're wondering,
there's nothing sparkling under that water tonight.
Oh, I'm sure you'll dazzle me somehow.
you're a creative problem-solver now, right?
a changed man, or at least "changing.
I suppose.
there's no supposing about it, Dexter .
you've taken control of your addiction
in a way that few people do.
it's been about a week since we've even discussed your recovery.
I think you're right.
and you haven't felt the need to use?
incredibly, no. I feel...
you know, like I'm finally in control of things again.
we call that warm fuzzy feeling the pink cloud.
it's when an addict experiences acceptance for the first time.
you're saying it won't last?
I'm saying that you have to work it -- that's all.
but I know that you will,
because I believe that we've found a true substitute for your addiction.
what's that?
life.
you're making us all look bad.
I'm the manager of il bistro Vino .
happy anniversary -- on the house.
thank you.
Oh, did you hear that, darling?
Oh, I heard it, darling.
enjoy your evening.
thank you.
happy anniversary, my love.
aren't we in recovery?
Oh, this? It's just bubbles.
we're not gonna shoot it up, are we?
you really have a way. You know that?
a way of what?
of whatever the hell you want.
well, here's to 10 more glorious years
of whatever the hell I want.
Hi, I'm Cody , and I researched saudI Arabia
for my cultural report.
that's good, sweetie.
now, look at me when you talk, okay?
and try and stand up straight.
my board is covered in sand
because saudI Arabia is one big desert.
one great big desert.
one great big desert.
it only rains in a tiny corner of the country,
so they save rainwater
okay, now, try and keep your fingers off your face.
you don't want people to think you're picking your nose.
you mean like this?
Cody, you need to take this seriously.
Dexter said it should be fun.
Dexter does drugs. He's wrong.
I finished my homework.
for the week?
Hey, guys. I'm home.
mom! - Sorry I'm so late.
I'm so happy to see you!
mom!
Oh, wow! What a greeting.
okay, why don't you guys go get ready for bed?
really, mom? I just got home.
they need their rest.
I will be in in just a minute to check on you.
those two are making great progress.
progress -- towards what?
their full potential!
mom, I know you're really good at these things,
but now that you're here,
have you thought about applying for a teaching job?
no, I'm through with the schools.
well, I thought teaching was your life.
and your children are going to be the beneficiaries of all that I have to offer.
our injunction stopped the tribune
from publishing the manifesto -- for now.
at the very least, we'll have time to get a jump on things before the news frenzy hits.
so, let's take advantage of this window.
our goal for the next 48 hours is to wade through
this shining piece of social commentary.
I've never seen so many dense and convoluted ideas in my life,
but we need to search them all for clues to his identity.
so, first impressions? I got something.
there are a lot of literary references in this document.
how do you know? - I like to read books.
what kind of books?
all kinds. Who cares?
Anyway...I see lots of references, like this one.
you can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.
he's a trekker!
that shit's straight from "deep space nine"
what? Mark twain said that.
it's one of his most famous quotes.
twain was never on "deep space nine."
he was on "next Gene ration.
he didn't say it on "star trek.
okay, so what's it from?
a Connecticut yankee in king Arthur's court.
angel, what other literary quotes are in that manifesto?
this guy -- he's the best boxing student I have ever had.
after four weeks, he's getting in shots to my head.
and finally he says, "I think I'm ready.
I'm like, "you're ready for what?"
and he says, "to kick my mom's ass."
I'm like, "you're learning how to box
because you want to beat up your mom?"
what the fuck?!
did -- did you hear what I said?
I was gonna hit the showers.
I'll meet you back here in 10 minutes.
okay, yeah, 10 minutes.
who the fuck are you?
Oh, hi! I'm Lila .
Oh, pardon my tits.
um, we thought you were crashing at your boyfriend's tonight.
we -- we who?
Dexter and I.
could you just...wait here a minute?
who's the skank?
Deb, did knocking occur to you?
who is she?
and are you trying to fuck her or set her on fire?
I didn't do this to you when you were riding square-jaw guy with the handcuffs.
that's different.
I wasn't cheating on anyone with Gabriel .
how could you do this to Rita , not to mention her kids?
you're like their father.
Hey, Rita broke up with me, okay?
you fucked up, Dex ...
...big-time.
excuse me.
don't worry.
she just needs some time to adjust -- that's all.
I had officers tear apart the stepfather's house
no murder weapon, but he had to hide it somewhere.
where is Wilson now? - Interview room 2.
we still have him? Why didn't his lawyer post bond?
well, he tried, but I pulled in a favor at the courthouse
and got a bail enhancement,
so they had to start the paperwork all over again.
I'm gonna break that cocksucker today.
what evidence you say we got on this guy?
he was dripping in the victim's blood.
he was home alone with her.
they fought the morning of the murder. All circumstantial.
Yeah, but the blood spatter on his shirt was a direct result of a blunt-force beating, Maria .
I'd like to see the blood report.
you'll get it as soon as I do.
if you're looking for me, I'll be questioning the suspect.
they're still playing my tune.
it's like I'm conducting a final symphony, "requiem for demonic Dexter ."
and forming the entire brass section,
sergeant James Doakes .
when I reach the end,
maybe I can lay to rest the monster
formerly known as Dexter .
just hang in there, Mr. Wilson.
I've asked a psycholinguist at m. i.t.
to analyze our manifesto.
his computer tabulates punctuation, misspellings,
and sentence structure to identify a set of key words,
which he'll use to create a profile of our killer.
Sounds...complicated. Stay on it.
okay, we've been at this too long.
it's, uh, 1: 00.
let's break for lunch.
are you all right?
huh? Yeah, I'm fine.
anything you want to talk about?
no, not really.
well, if you change your mind -- it's my brother.
he was dating this chick
super sweet, a little doe-eyed.
but, god, for him, fucking perfect,
and he just threw her away.
I'm just pissed at Dexter , not to mention my boyfriend,
who did absolutely nothing wrong.
but every time he opened his mouth last night,
I wanted to fucking slap him.
you've been listening to Chopin.
Yeah, I downloaded a Chopin
um, "nocturne number 2 in e flat major."
one of my favorites.
it, uh, can have this effect on people.
it can stir up some dust.
no shit.
listen, you -- you can heal yourself, sir.
just -- you just need to talk to me.
get it off you,
otherwise, it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
why don't you just listen to me?
I didn't do this.
you -- you can't say it and make it true.
you have a conscience,
and it's really fucking with you right now.
I wish it were me. I wish I were dead.
Yeah.
why are we questioning that guy?
he's a murder suspect.
no, he's not. He's innocent.
what did you say?
my blood report backed his story.
Mr. Wilson found his stepdaughter dead,
just like I told sergeant Doakes at the crime scene.
you turned in the blood report? When?
I don't know
at some point before I went home last night.
I put it right on the sergeant's desk,
just like he asked.
the green folder.
Yeah, according to my findings,
the mist on the stepfather's shirt was exhaled
from the victim when he tried to revive her.
the autopsy confirmed she had severe internal bleeding,
due to the bludgeoning.
Yeah, but he could have beaten her first.
that's impossible.
the crime-scene photos show blood radiating outward
around the victim's body.
that kind of bludgeoning would have covered the real killer
in blood from head to toe.
Thanks.
Mr. Wilson, you're free to go.
what the hell? Lieutenant, this man is a killer.
this man has been through enough for one day.
there's an officer in the hallway.
he'll see that you get your personal belongings back
and take you home.
thank you, ma'am. Thank you so much.
what the hell are you doing?
trying to save your career, James , if it isn't too late.
did you even check the blood report?
I didn't get the blood report.
it's on your desk, and it exonerates your suspect.
we should be out there looking for the real killer.
Maria, that is not what he told me at
that motherfucker.
he's good.
who?
Morgan.
he planned this whole thing.
Maria, that psychopath set me up.
Dexter again? You're blaming Dexter for this?
do you have any idea how pathetic that sounds?
this is not about Dexter !
this is about the poor judgment you have been displaying
in this department for months now!
you want to work out?
no.
I wasn't talking about the gym.
you're sweet, but I'm really not in the mood.
so, what do you want to do?
uh...
I think I want to break up.
for real?
Yeah.
is that okay?
no.
no, it's not okay.
fuck, what did I do, Deb ?
nothing. I swear to god.
You're...smoking hot and...fun
And...soulful and...
age-appropriate.
and but what?
but...
sometimes the truth speaks from a peaceful place.
it's taken me a long time to find that place,
but I think I have,
and it's telling me you're not the right one for me.
I'm so sorry.
you live in a nice neighborhood.
Yeah, I had no idea.
I'm usually passing by at 35 miles per hour.
I'm not a real big walker.
everybody walks in London.
of course, they're usually walking to the pub.
how far are we going?
Oh, you're a bit grumpy tonight.
what's wrong?
come on. Don't close up on me now.
no, I honestly don't know.
I mean, thanks to you, things are...
actually looking up.
some people at work have been...after me.
I think I have them under control.
so, why the grouchiness?
is it because your sister thinks I'm a trollop?
it's not just... Deb .
it's the suddenness of all of this
losing Rita , the kids.
they've been the only thing keeping me human for a long time.
were they keeping you human, though,
or were they the ones making you feel like the monster
that you were talking about?
keep going.
your friends and family have to accept you
for who you're evolving into now that you're clean.
is that what I am
clean?
cause I don't feel that way at all.
no, you certainly don't.
Mmm, god.
I wish I could fuck you right now.
whose house is this?
couldn't tell you.
God.
he's a man of many talents.
Ah!
look. I'm some old bitch.
better not press our luck. We should go.
Hello?
Hi, Dexter .
Cody?
can you come to my school tomorrow?
what's at your school, buddy?
I'm doing my cultural report.
saudi Arabia.
can you watch me? I'm kind of scared.
Cody, what are you doing?
who is this?
Dexter.
Hello?
who was that?
Rita's son.
he wants me to come see him at school tomorrow.
Oh, poor kid.
he doesn't understand that you've gone.
I think I'll go.
whatever you think's best.
Hey, guys!
I'm home!
Hello?
they're in bed.
why so early?
Cody is being punished for sneaking away
to make a phone call without permission.
Astor joined him in a misguided show of support.
well, who was Cody calling?
Dexter.
the boy was trying to invite him to his school.
can you imagine? Oh.
mom, we need to have a talk.
I made a phone call of my own today.
I spoke with aunt Cecilia.
she told me the school district fired you almost a year ago.
we had philosophical differences.
the educational system is falling apart.
school should be life itself, not a preparation for living.
do you know that they give trophies to every child now whether they win or lose?
Yeah, I finally get it.
it took me a few decades, but it's not just me
nobody can deal with you.
you don't leave room for anybody else to exist.
it's not my fault that so many people are willing to settle for mediocrity.
just look at you -- first Paul, then Dexter .
Rita, you lack even common sense,
and now you're passing that torch of ordinary character
on to your children.
shut the fuck up.
nobody talks about my kids that way.
Thatagirl.
that's what I've been waiting to see.
Yeah! I'm done with you.
no, you're not.
but you go -- you give me hell.
no.
no, I won't do that.
I won't let you turn me into...you.
Rita - here's what's gonna happen
first thing in the morning,
you're gonna pack up and go home.
you'll come and visit us for birthdays and holidays,
but you're not gonna live with us anymore.
well...
...if that's what I have to sacrifice
to get you on your feet...
kill one man, and you're a murderer.
kill thousands, a conqueror.
kill them all, and you're a god.
does it sound to you like our guy
has a narcissistic personality disorder,
a classic god complex?
I think you're onto something, Angel .
to tell you the truth,
I don't know what my alter ego had in mind
when he wrote that crap.
I just pulled from various blogs on the internet,
mixed and matched -- presto manifesto.
you finally decided to fight back.
I been waiting.
hope you don't expect me to comment on that
so you can record it on your hidden tape recorder.
I wasn't born yesterday.
you might have been, for all I know.
your past is a bigger mystery than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.
I tried every avenue, legal and otherwise, but there ain't no paper trail on the early years of Dexter Morgan .
I guess there's no recorder running, after all.
no, man.
unlike you, I do everything out in the open.
well, in that case, sergeant,
let me put this in the open for you.
no matter what you try, no matter when,
no matter how hard you work,
I'll always be a step ahead of you for one simple reason.
and what's that?
I own you.
Aah! Fuck!
get him off of me! Get off me!
why are you doing this?!
stop!
I want your gun, your badge, and your police I. d.
I want your access card, too
now!
type a statement that sergeant Doakes
is on administrative leave,
pending an internal affairs investigation.
you two, get him out of here.
Thanks.
what the hell happened?
I don't know. He just...jumped me.
that guy's always had it out for me.
thanks for meeting with me, don.
well, I don't know what the point is.
the district court injunction hearing starts in three hours.
which everyone here knows we're going to lose.
don't look so shocked. We always lose these things.
you bastards and your free speech.
my boss never lets me say anything.
I'll tell you what
I will agree to dropping the injunction,
which will save us days of courtroom arguments
and a boatload of legal fees,
if we can agree on some simple ground rules
on how you publish that document.
ground rules.
we're not gonna have any ground rules.
my only goal here is to avoid compromising an investigation of a mass murderer...
who could hurt a lot more people.
give me just a second, will you, frank?
I can't believe you got those assholes
to publish the manifesto without the victims' names
and as a page-3 story.
no sense hype in it.
it might just inspire the killer to greater heights.
wait.
it's quiet here...
peaceful.
it's a good spot.
for what?
it's 1: 00.
so it is.
I brought my own sandwich.
I thought you didn't like the quiet, Morgan .
I didn't.
I don't.
when I'm alone and it's quiet, I get scared...
shitless,
like I start hearing what's really going on inside.
I see.
so if it's all the same to you,
maybe I can just practice when you're around.
okay.
cause when you're around,
I kind of feel like I can deal with anything, you know?
like what happened to me
I don't have to run from it.
I don't have to jump into bed with some guy and hide there.
you give me strength.
I'm kind of opening up here.
what do you want me to say?
I don't know.
you're the fucking zen master. Figure it out.
Morgan...
I've got plaque in my arteries.
I know the lyrics to elevator music.
my hair isn't getting any thicker.
you're gonna do great up there.
you just have to remember something
they're more frightened than you are.
no, they're not.
are so.
you're gonna be staring at them the whole time.
if one of those unsuspecting moms or dads
does something embarrassing while you're up on stage...
like pick their nose?
...you're gonna be the one who sees it.
Yeah.
now that's power.
now go have fun.
Dexter, over here. We saved you a seat.
Thanks, guys.
there you go -- $18, 000.
I'll send a truck for the piece tomorrow.
I am telling you, Lila ,
this is going to create a critical mass for you.
according to the psycholinguistic analysis
of the manifesto,
our killer is a white male in his 50s.
what else?
uh, the killer has no girlfriends
and considers himself a good catholic.
hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
how can you tell all that by putting words in a computer?
I don't know, dude. It's science.
how about common sense?
I think the guy that we're looking for is pissed off at god,
and that's why he kills people.
Really? I actually found him very politically motivated.
Yeah, like a modern-day revolutionary.
which would suggest that he's killing for social change.
this is what he wants.
what's that?
confusion, chaos
it's what the killer wants.
he's always been an intensely private figure,
dispatching victims silently.
now he's suddenly a media whore? It doesn't make sense.
he's creating a clusterfuck.
very good, officer Morgan .
the killer's making us chase our tails.
you know what that means?
he knows how we work.
look how he hits every major theme
political, environmental, religious.
in one section, he manages to weave together Julius Caesar,
berlin, Germany, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Gandhi.
it's scattershot.
he knew that this would send us scurrying
like squirrels for nuts.
Yeah, but to suggest that he might be one of us
how can you be sure?
Hi, I'm Cody , and I researched saudI Arabia
for my cultural report.
my board is covered in sand
because saudI Arabia is one big desert.
as you can see, I used coffee beans to write "saudI Arabia."
arabic coffee is very famous.
I'm a little confused.
Lila is the one showing me how to take control,
stop killing, get my life clean.
but this is the first time since I went into recovery
that I actually feel clean.
the children in saudI Arabia are just like us,
because they...
this is the saudI Arabian flag.
the Arabic letters mean "there is no god except Allah."
do you know how tough it is for a woman in saudI Arabia?
they can't drive or have powerful jobs.
or get this -- they can't even go to the movies without men's permission.
after they turn 12, they have to wear long black sleeves,
and they can't hardly even talk to men until they get married.
the new king, Abdullah,
is trying to change some old bad rules,
so women can do more things...
thank you very much for listening.
or, as they say in Arabic, "shokran."
I can't believe how calm you were up there.
Yeah, you were like a professional talker.
you were pretty good.
can Dexter come for ice cream with us?
can he, mom, please?
Uh...sure, Dexter can join us.
I wouldn't miss it.
maybe they'll have some delicious saudI flavors,
like sand or oil.
hang on a sec, guys.
hello.
are you hurt?
O-okay, okay. I'm coming now.
I know. Me too.
come on, kids. Dexter won't be joining us.
Rita, it's an emergency.
look, I'm so sorry, you guys.
I'm gonna make it up to you,
but I got to help a friend who's in trouble.
there was a fire at her place.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, let's go.
Dexter.
what happened?
I was working on my piece with the blowtorch,
and it just caught fire. I was so scared.
Oh, I guess so.
promise me that you won't leave me,
that you won't go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
Hey, you got your light fixed.
you??
do U ???
???
maybe ???
you???
are you ???
???
DEX??
Dexter ???
those ??
???
it's
how MUCH
you ???
I've been??
I know??
he could??
he BROKE??
he's PROBABLY GONNA START TAILING ME AGAIN.
sergeant DOAKES TAILED YOU?
I FOLLOWED HIM TO AN N. A. MEETING.
that ASSHOLE LIED ABOUT THAT, TOO.
you're OBSESSED. I'M NOT.
and I NEED YOU TO SEE IT!
dinner WAS FANTASTIC, RITA. WOW.
I KIND OF LIKE HER.
Lila: Dex, just calling to check in.
imagine Rita's face if I told her that you and I had spent the night together in a hotel.
it's OVER, DEXTER.
I GUESS I JUST HOPE WITH LUNDY IT WILL BE DIFFERENT.
Why? I RESPECT HIM.
you LOVE HIM.
no. HE'S LIKE MY DAD.
you WANT TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
you're THE ONE WHO SAID I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL MY FEELINGS!
well, NOW I'M TELLING YOU TO GET THEM UNDER CONTROL!
which STEP WAS THAT?
that night, forest grew
Lila: USE THE ENTIRE CANVAS.
start FROM THE TOP. WORK YOUR WAY DOWN.
light, FEATHERY STROKES.
perfect!
stunning.
try LONGER STROKES NOW.
perfect.
you REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, DON'T YOU?
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
some MEN DO.
no.
I've ALWAYS FOUND INSTRUCTION MANUALS...
quite USEFUL.
okay, YOUR TURN.
what DO YOU WANT?
I THINK THAT WAS IT.
hmm, COME ON.
you MUST HAVE SOME DARK FANTASIES...
...UNFULFILLED URGES.
I'm PRETTY GOOD AT ACTING ON THOSE.
Really?
then FUCK ME LIKE THAT.
your LIGHT'S BURNED OUT.
it's THE WIRING.
I've BEEN ASKING MY LANDLORD TO FIX IT FOR WEEKS.
well, NOW I CAN SEE BETTER.
that's WHERE MY LANDLORD LIVES.
now HE'LL HAVE TO FIX IT.
see YOU LATER.
got TO ADMIRE LILA FOR TAKING THINGS INTO HER OWN HANDS.
that INCLUDES ME.
Ohh. MOM. [ SIGHS ]
come ON, LET'S GO! NO MORE MOPING.
I'm NOT MOPING. I'M SLEEPING.
oversleeping -- THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.
the ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET OVER DEXTER
is IF YOU TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR DAY.
come ON. YOU'RE NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE.
go SCRUB YOUR FACE, AND I'LL HEAT UP SOME OATMEAL.
didn't HEAR YOU COME IN LAST NIGHT.
well, IT WAS LATE. I WAS QUIET.
Yeah, YOU'RE GOOD AT QUIET.
guess YOU KIND OF HAVE TO BE WITH ME CRASHING HERE
and RITA'S MOM OVER THERE.
you AND RITA FUCK QUIET, TOO?
and SHE'S OFF, RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.
because ME -- I WAKE THE GODDAMN DEAD.
it's A PROBLEM.
Oh, I KNOW, ONLY TOO WELL.
scary, RIGHT?
sometimes I DISTURB MYSELF.
so [CHUCKLES] WHAT KIND OF NOISES DOES RITA MAKE?
could WE NOT TALK ABOUT SEX...
or RITA?
Why?
cause WE BROKE UP...
for REAL.
it's OVER.
you BREAK UP, YOU GET BACK TOGETHER
that's JUST WHAT GOES ON.
I MEAN, YOU AND RITA ARE FOREVER.
just SAY YOU'RE SORRY AND SEND SOME FUCKING FLOWERS.
you're NOT HEARING ME.
look, WHEN ALL THIS BLOWS OVER,
I'll SPEND A FEW DAYS AT GABRIEL'S, AND...
you CAN SCREW RITA AS LOUD AS YOU WANT.
big NEWS, DEX.
Whoa! FEEL LIKE I GOT CAUGHT IN A WAVE.
the MIAMI TRIBUNE RECEIVED A 32-PAGE MANIFESTO IN THE MAIL.
it's LOOKING GOOD FOR THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER.
well, I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.
look, THIS MAY BE LEGIT.
the MANIFESTO INCLUDES THE NAMES OF THREE VICTIMS
we NEVER RELEASED TO THE PRESS.
Oh, THAT IS BIG NEWS.
I'm HEADING OVER TO THE TRIBUNE NOW FOR SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY.
he PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THE TEAM.
go, ANGEL.
Yeah, I'M PSYCHED.
Yeah, ME TOO. I'M ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED.
I SENT THAT MANIFESTO TO THE TRIBUNE.
guess I'VE BEEN TAKING SOME CUES FROM LILA LATELY, AND NOT JUST IN BED.
I'm TIRED OF REACTING TO THE MOVES OF AGENT LUNDY AND HIS SUPER POSSE.
time TO CONTROL THEIR ACTIONS FOR A CHANGE.
Betsy COURT, 16. BLUNT-FORCE BEATING.
it LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS SUNNING HERSELF
and NEVER SAW IT COMING.
who CALLED IN THE BODY?
Craig WILSON, THE STEPFATHER. HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
Wilson TOLD THE REPORTING OFFICER
that HE CAME HOME FOR LUNCH AND FOUND HER THAT WAY.
um, YOU AND DEXTER RESOLVE YOUR ISSUES?
as FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
Why? THE BITCH COME CRYING TO YOU AGAIN?
no.
there's BLOOD WORK TO BE DONE HERE,
and IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL YOURSELF,
I NEED TO CALL IN ANOTHER DETECTIVE.
I WON'T SAY ANYTHING TO HURT THE LITTLE GIRL'S FEELINGS.
God DAMN IT, JAMES, I'M NOT JOKING.
do I LOOK LIKE I'M LAUGHING?
no. YOU DON'T. I WISH YOU WOULD. YOU USED TO.
bullshit. I NEVER LAUGHED.
[ scoffs ] YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
now, LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO SCARE YOU ANYMORE.
the REALITY IS, YOU'RE OUT OF FREE PASSES.
now, I ALREADY STOPPED DEXTER FROM FILING A COMPLAINT
against YOU ONCE.
I NEVER ASKED YOU TO DO THAT, MARIA. WELL, I DID IT,
out OF MY OWN CONCERN OVER YOUR OBSESSIVE BEHAVIOR.
now I'M ON THE LINE,
so IF YOU BULLY DEXTER IN ANY WAY
if YOU EVEN LOOK AT HIM WRONG,
I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FALLOUT.
you GOT IT?
I GOT IT.
you're BACKING THE FUCKING FREAKTARD.
where YOU BEEN, DEXTER?
you DON'T BRING ME DOUGHNUTS.
you DON'T SING ME LOVE SONGS.
how ARE YOU, CAMILLA?
I've BEEN BETTER.
well, THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
sergeant DOAKES DROPPED BY MY FILE ROOM YESTERDAY.
he REQUESTED THE CASE FILES
for THE 1973 SHIPPING-YARD MURDERS.
I GAVE HIM THE SAME LINE I GAVE YOU
when YOU CAME SNIFFING AROUND,
said ALL THAT OLD STUFF WAS BOXED UP
in THE BASEMENT OF CITY HALL.
that MADE HIM REAL ANGRY.
he SCARED ME, DEXTER.
that's NOT RIGHT. HE SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
look, DEX, I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT YOUR FATHER ASKED ME
to DESTROY THOSE FILES TO PROTECT YOU.
now I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON.
now, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET FIRED.
I'm RETIRING NEXT YEAR. DID I TELL YOU?
I've BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO STAYING HOME WITH GENE.
you WON'T LOSE YOUR RETIREMENT. I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
I CAN STALL SERGEANT DOAKES FOR A FEW DAYS,
but EVENTUALLY, HE'LL FIGURE OUT
that THAT CASE FILE'S MISSING, JUST LIKE YOU DID.
and HE'LL TRACK IT BACK TO ME,
you KNOW, JUST LIKE YOU DID.
I'll TAKE CARE OF THIS. YOU HAVE MY WORD.
so MUCH FOR THREATENING DOAKES.
he WON'T BACK OFF TILL HE EXPOSES THE TWISTED BRANCHES OF MY FAMILY TREE, FROM MY FATHER'S INDISCRETIONS TO MY MURDEROUS BROTHER TO THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL -- ME.
Hey.
why AREN'T YOU AT THE TRIBUNE?
what FOR?
our GUY'S NOT GONNA LEAVE DNA EVIDENCE ON A DOCUMENT.
Oh, BUT THE THRILL OF THE HUNT.
I've HAD THAT PARTICULAR THRILL.
I'll LEAVE IT TO YOUNGER MEN.
besides, IT'S EASIER FOR ME TO DO MY PART FROM HERE.
yeah? WHAT PART IS THAT?
operating ON FAVORS, POLITICAL LEANINGS, POSTURING.
I've BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT MUSIC.
right.
so, I'M OFF DUTY TODAY,
but HERE ARE THOSE MARINA REPORTS.
and AFTER MY WORKOUT,
I'll SWING BY AND PICK UP A COPY OF THE MANIFESTO.
look AT THAT BOARD.
these KILLS ARE PRECISE,
but THERE'S ALSO A FLUIDITY,
even SOME IMPROVISATION.
if I COULD JUST FIND THE MUSIC...
want TO BORROW MY iPod?
got ANY CHOPIN?
no. FRESH OUT OF CHOPIN.
shit. CHOPIN'S PERFECT.
did YOU JUST SWEAR?
[ Chuckles ] WHAT CAN I SAY?
you're RUBBING OFF ON ME, MORGAN.
but CHOPIN IS PERFECT.
so THIS IS HOW YOU DO WHAT YOU DO.
the TRUTH SPEAKS TO ME FROM A PEACEFUL PLACE.
I GOT TO SET THE STAGE TO HEAR IT.
you KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
no.
I THRIVE ON CHAOS.
but THIS IS GOOD, TOO.
I DIDN'T KILL HER.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO STOP THE BLOOD.
no FORCEFUL IMPACT SPATTER
he's TELLING THE TRUTH. I CAN TELL.
palms UP, PLEASE.
when I FOUND BETSY, SHE WAS STILL BREATHING.
I WANTED TO HELP HER.
you BELIEVE ME, RIGHT?
I'm JUST THE LAB GUY, MR. WILSON. SORRY.
arms DOWN AT YOUR SIDES, PLEASE.
blood MISTING. HUH.
I NEED TO COLLECT HIS SHIRT FOR EVIDENCE.
the GIRL'S MOTHER WAS AT WORK,
but SHE ISN'T REALLY DEFENDING HER HUSBAND.
Wilson AND HIS STEPDAUGHTER FOUGHT ALL THE TIME.
the NEIGHBORS HEARD HIM YELLING AT HER THIS MORNING.
then HE COMES HOME FOR LUNCH -- MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY.
What'd THE BLOOD SAY?
well, THE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS COULD HAVE COME
from TRYING TO HELP HER, LIKE HE CLAIMS.
but I DID DETECT, UH, BLOOD MIST ON HIS SHIRT.
a BLOOD MIST
the KIND THAT COMES FROM BEATING ON A TEENAGE GIRL?
no. YES.
you're ABSOLUTELY SURE?
it's TOO FINE FOR A BLUDGEONING.
the MIST IS FROM A BLUDGEONING.
medium-velocity IMPACT SPATTERS -- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
okay, MORGAN.
just MAKE SURE YOU GET ME YOUR BLOOD REPORT
as SOON AS POSSIBLE.
this IS MY CHANCE TO MAKE DOAKES GO AWAY WITHOUT SPILLING A SINGLE DROP OF HIS BLOOD.
of COURSE, I HAVE TO SELL AN INNOCENT MAN DOWN THE RIVER.
sorry, MR. WILSON, BUT I WON'T LET YOU FLOAT TOO FAR.
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
hmm. I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
Yeah, I HAD TO DO A LITTLE CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING
at SOMEONE ELSE'S EXPENSE.
Bravo.
Yeah, I figured you'd like that.
what's up?
well, YOU KNOW THAT ART INSTALLATION
that I'VE BEEN WORKING ON?
the CANNIBALS.
they're not cannibals. How barbaric!
their EATING IS SYMBOLIC
of THE WAY WE CONSUME OTHERS TO FEED OUR NEEDS.
that's WHAT I MEANT.
well, IT SOLD.
I-I DIDN'T EVEN CREATE IT TO SELL, BUT ONE OF MY BUYERS fell in love with it, and I named an outrageous price, and she paid me a deposit on the spot.
so...
you IN THE MOOD TO CELEBRATE?
definitely.
I'm AFRAID WE JUST CAN'T SEAT YOU TONIGHT
without A RESERVATION.
as YOU CAN SEE, WE ARE COMPLETELY AT CAPACITY.
Oh, WELL
no, I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE TO HELP US.
I MADE THIS RESERVATION TWO MONTHS AGO.
this IS OUR 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.
this IS THE PLACE WHERE DEXTER PROPOSED TO ME
on THE PATIO, IN FRONT OF THE FOUNTAIN.
he TOLD ME TO MAKE A WISH, AND WHEN I LOOKED DOWN,
there WAS MY DIAMOND RING, SPARKLING UNDER THE WATER.
that IS SO ROMANTIC.
Dexter: IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,
there's NOTHING SPARKLING UNDER THAT WATER TONIGHT.
[ Chuckles ] OH, I'M SURE YOU'LL DAZZLE ME SOMEHOW.
you're A CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVER NOW, RIGHT?
a CHANGED MAN, OR AT LEAST "CHANGING.
I SUPPOSE.
there's NO SUPPOSING ABOUT IT, DEXTER.
you've TAKEN CONTROL OF YOUR ADDICTION
in A WAY THAT FEW PEOPLE DO.
it's BEEN ABOUT A WEEK
since WE'VE EVEN DISCUSSED YOUR RECOVERY.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
and YOU HAVEN'T FELT THE NEED TO USE?
incredibly, NO. I FEEL...
you KNOW, LIKE I'M FINALLY IN CONTROL OF THINGS AGAIN.
we CALL THAT WARM FUZZY FEELING THE PINK CLOUD.
it's WHEN AN ADDICT EXPERIENCES ACCEPTANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
you're SAYING IT WON'T LAST?
I'm SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK IT -- THAT'S ALL.
but I KNOW THAT YOU WILL,
because I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE FOUND A TRUE SUBSTITUTE
for YOUR ADDICTION.
what's THAT?
life.
you're MAKING US ALL LOOK BAD.
I'm THE MANAGER OF IL BISTRO VINO.
happy ANNIVERSARY -- ON THE HOUSE.
thank YOU. [ CHUCKLES ]
Oh, DID YOU HEAR THAT, DARLING?
Oh, I HEARD IT, DARLING.
enjoy YOUR EVENING.
thank YOU.
happy ANNIVERSARY, MY LOVE.
aren't WE IN RECOVERY?
Oh, THIS? IT'S JUST BUBBLES.
we're NOT GONNA SHOOT IT UP, ARE WE?
you REALLY HAVE A WAY. YOU KNOW THAT?
a WAY OF WHAT?
of WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.
well, HERE'S TO 10 MORE GLORIOUS YEARS
of WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT.
Hi, I'M CODY, AND I RESEARCHED SAUDI ARABIA
for MY CULTURAL REPORT.
Gail: THAT'S GOOD, SWEETIE.
now, LOOK AT ME WHEN YOU TALK, OKAY?
and TRY AND STAND UP STRAIGHT.
my BOARD IS COVERED IN SAND
because SAUDI ARABIA IS ONE BIG DESERT.
one GREAT BIG DESERT.
one GREAT BIG DESERT.
it ONLY RAINS IN A TINY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY,
so THEY SAVE RAINWATER
okay, NOW, TRY AND KEEP YOUR FINGERS OFF YOUR FACE.
you DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK YOU'RE PICKING YOUR NOSE.
you MEAN LIKE THIS?
Cody, YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
Dexter SAID IT SHOULD BE FUN.
Dexter DOES DRUGS. HE'S WRONG.
I FINISHED MY HOMEWORK.
for THE WEEK?
Hey, GUYS. I'M HOME.
mom! SORRY I'M SO LATE.
I'm SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU!
mom!
Oh, WOW! WHAT A GREETING.
okay, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO GET READY FOR BED?
really, MOM? I JUST GOT HOME.
they NEED THEIR REST.
I WILL BE IN IN JUST A MINUTE TO CHECK ON YOU.
those TWO ARE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS.
progress -- TOWARDS WHAT?
their FULL POTENTIAL!
mom, I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THESE THINGS,
but NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,
have YOU THOUGHT ABOUT APPLYING FOR A TEACHING JOB?
no, I'M THROUGH WITH THE SCHOOLS.
well, I THOUGHT TEACHING WAS YOUR LIFE.
and YOUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARIES
of ALL THAT I HAVE TO OFFER.
our INJUNCTION STOPPED THE TRIBUNE
from PUBLISHING THE MANIFESTO -- FOR NOW.
at THE VERY LEAST,
we'll HAVE TIME TO GET A JUMP ON THINGS
before THE NEWS FRENZY HITS.
so, LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS WINDOW.
our GOAL FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS IS TO WADE THROUGH
this SHINING PIECE OF SOCIAL COMMENTARY.
I've NEVER SEEN SO MANY DENSE AND CONVOLUTED IDEAS IN MY LIFE,
but WE NEED TO SEARCH THEM ALL FOR CLUES TO HIS IDENTITY.
so, FIRST IMPRESSIONS? I GOT SOMETHING.
there ARE A LOT OF LITERARY REFERENCES IN THIS DOCUMENT.
how DO YOU KNOW? I LIKE TO READ BOOKS.
what KIND OF BOOKS?
all KINDS. WHO CARES?
ANYWAY...I SEE LOTS OF REFERENCES, LIKE THIS ONE.
you CAN'T DEPEND ON YOUR EYES
when YOUR IMAGINATION IS OUT OF FOCUS.
[ Chuckles ] HE'S A TREKKER!
that SHIT'S STRAIGHT FROM "DEEP SPACE NINE.
what? MARK TWAIN SAID THAT.
it's ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS QUOTES.
twain WAS NEVER ON "DEEP SPACE NINE.
he WAS ON "NEXT GENERATION.
he DIDN'T SAY IT ON "STAR TREK.
okay, SO WHAT'S IT FROM?
a CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT.
angel, WHAT OTHER LITERARY QUOTES ARE IN THAT MANIFESTO?
this GUY -- HE'S THE BEST BOXING STUDENT I HAVE EVER HAD.
after FOUR WEEKS, HE'S GETTING IN SHOTS TO MY HEAD.
and FINALLY HE SAYS, "I THINK I'M READY.
I'm LIKE, "YOU'RE READY FOR WHAT?
and HE SAYS, "TO KICK MY MOM'S ASS.
I'm LIKE, "YOU'RE LEARNING HOW TO BOX
because YOU WANT TO BEAT UP YOUR MOM?
what THE FUCK?!
did -- DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?
I WAS GONNA HIT THE SHOWERS.
I'll MEET YOU BACK HERE IN 10 MINUTES.
okay, YEAH, 10 MINUTES.
who THE FUCK ARE YOU?
Oh, HI! I'M LILA.
Oh, PARDON MY TITS.
um, WE THOUGHT YOU WERE CRASHING AT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S TONIGHT.
we -- WE WHO?
Dexter AND I.
could YOU JUST...WAIT HERE A MINUTE?
who's THE SKANK?
Deb, DID KNOCKING OCCUR TO YOU?
who IS SHE?
and ARE YOU TRYING TO FUCK HER OR SET HER ON FIRE?
I DIDN'T DO THIS TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE RIDING SQUARE-JAW GUY
with THE HANDCUFFS.
that's DIFFERENT. I WASN'T CHEATING ON ANYONE WITH GABRIEL.
how COULD YOU DO THIS TO RITA, NOT TO MENTION HER KIDS?
you're LIKE THEIR FATHER.
Hey, RITA BROKE UP WITH ME, OKAY?
you FUCKED UP, DEX...
...BIG-TIME.
EW. EXCUSE ME.
don't WORRY.
she JUST NEEDS SOME TIME TO ADJUST -- THAT'S ALL.
I HAD OFFICERS TEAR APART THE STEPFATHER'S HOUSE
no MURDER WEAPON, BUT HE HAD TO HIDE IT SOMEWHERE.
where IS WILSON NOW? INTERVIEW ROOM 2.
we STILL HAVE HIM? WHY DIDN'T HIS LAWYER POST BOND?
well, HE TRIED, BUT I PULLED IN A FAVOR AT THE COURTHOUSE
and GOT A BAIL ENHANCEMENT,
so THEY HAD TO START THE PAPERWORK ALL OVER AGAIN.
I'm GONNA BREAK THAT COCKSUCKER TODAY.
what EVIDENCE YOU SAY WE GOT ON THIS GUY?
he WAS DRIPPING IN THE VICTIM'S BLOOD.
he WAS HOME ALONE WITH HER.
they FOUGHT THE MORNING OF THE MURDER. ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
Yeah, BUT THE BLOOD SPATTER ON HIS SHIRT WAS A DIRECT RESULT
of A BLUNT-FORCE BEATING, MARIA.
I'd LIKE TO SEE THE BLOOD REPORT.
you'll GET IT AS SOON AS I DO.
if YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME, I'LL BE QUESTIONING THE SUSPECT.
they're STILL PLAYING MY TUNE.
it's LIKE I'M CONDUCTING A FINAL SYMPHONY, "REQUIEM FOR DEMONIC DEXTER.
and FORMING THE ENTIRE BRASS SECTION, SERGEANT JAMES DOAKES.
when I REACH THE END, MAYBE I CAN LAY TO REST THE MONSTER FORMERLY KNOWN AS DEXTER.
just HANG IN THERE, MR. WILSON.
I've ASKED A PSYCHOLINGUIST AT M. I.T.
to ANALYZE OUR MANIFESTO.
his COMPUTER TABULATES PUNCTUATION, MISSPELLINGS,
and SENTENCE STRUCTURE TO IDENTIFY A SET OF KEY WORDS,
which HE'LL USE TO CREATE A PROFILE OF OUR KILLER.
SOUNDS...COMPLICATED. STAY ON IT.
okay, WE'VE BEEN AT THIS TOO LONG.
it's, UH, 1: 00.
let's BREAK FOR LUNCH.
are YOU ALL RIGHT?
huh? YEAH, I'M FINE.
anything YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?
no, NOT REALLY.
well, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND -- IT'S MY BROTHER.
he WAS DATING THIS CHICK
SUPERSWEET, A LITTLE DOE-EYED.
but, GOD, FOR HIM, FUCKING PERFECT,
and HE JUST THREW HER AWAY.
I'm JUST PISSED AT DEXTER, NOT TO MENTION MY BOYFRIEND,
who DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG.
but EVERY TIME HE OPENED HIS MOUTH LAST NIGHT,
I WANTED TO FUCKING SLAP HIM.
you've BEEN LISTENING TO CHOPIN.
Yeah, I DOWNLOADED A CHOPIN
um, "NOCTURNE NUMBER 2 IN E FLAT MAJOR.
one OF MY FAVORITES.
it, UH, CAN HAVE THIS EFFECT ON PEOPLE.
it CAN STIR UP SOME DUST.
no SHIT.
listen, YOU -- YOU CAN HEAL YOURSELF, SIR.
just -- YOU JUST NEED TO TALK TO ME.
get IT OFF YOU, OTHERWISE, IT'S GONNA HAUNT YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
why DON'T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME?
I DIDN'T DO THIS.
you -- YOU CAN'T SAY IT AND MAKE IT TRUE.
you HAVE A CONSCIENCE, AND IT'S REALLY FUCKING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.
I WISH IT WERE ME. I WISH I WERE DEAD.
Yeah.
why ARE WE QUESTIONING THAT GUY?
he's A MURDER SUSPECT.
no, HE'S NOT. HE'S INNOCENT.
what DID YOU SAY?
my BLOOD REPORT BACKED HIS STORY.
Mr. WILSON FOUND HIS STEPDAUGHTER DEAD,
just LIKE I TOLD SERGEANT DOAKES AT THE CRIME SCENE.
you TURNED IN THE BLOOD REPORT? WHEN?
I DON'T KNOW
at SOME POINT BEFORE I WENT HOME LAST NIGHT.
I PUT IT RIGHT ON THE SERGEANT'S DESK,
just LIKE HE ASKED.
the GREEN FOLDER.
Yeah, ACCORDING TO MY FINDINGS,
the MIST ON THE STEPFATHER'S SHIRT WAS EXHALED
from THE VICTIM WHEN HE TRIED TO REVIVE HER.
the AUTOPSY CONFIRMED SHE HAD SEVERE INTERNAL BLEEDING,
due TO THE BLUDGEONING.
Yeah, BUT HE COULD HAVE BEATEN HER FIRST.
that's IMPOSSIBLE.
the CRIME-SCENE PHOTOS SHOW BLOOD RADIATING OUTWARD
around THE VICTIM'S BODY.
that KIND OF BLUDGEONING WOULD HAVE COVERED THE REAL KILLER
in BLOOD FROM HEAD TO TOE.
Thanks.
Mr. WILSON, YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
what THE HELL? LIEUTENANT, THIS MAN IS A KILLER.
this MAN HAS BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.
there's AN OFFICER IN THE HALLWAY.
he'll SEE THAT YOU GET YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS BACK
and TAKE YOU HOME.
thank YOU, MA'AM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
trying TO SAVE YOUR CAREER, JAMES, IF IT ISN'T TOO LATE.
did YOU EVEN CHECK THE BLOOD REPORT?
I DIDN'T GET THE BLOOD REPORT.
it's ON YOUR DESK, AND IT EXONERATES YOUR SUSPECT.
we SHOULD BE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THE REAL KILLER.
Maria, THAT IS NOT WHAT HE TOLD ME AT
that MOTHERFUCKER.
he's GOOD.
who?
he PLANNED THIS WHOLE THING.
Maria, THAT PSYCHOPATH SET ME UP.
Dexter AGAIN? YOU'RE BLAMING DEXTER FOR THIS?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW PATHETIC THAT SOUNDS?
this IS NOT ABOUT DEXTER!
this IS ABOUT THE POOR JUDGMENT YOU HAVE BEEN DISPLAYING
in THIS DEPARTMENT FOR MONTHS NOW!
you WANT TO WORK OUT?
no.
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THE GYM.
you're SWEET, BUT I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD.
so, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
uh...
I THINK I WANT TO BREAK UP.
for REAL?
Yeah.
is THAT OKAY?
no.
no, IT'S NOT OKAY.
fuck, WHAT DID I DO, DEB?
nothing. I SWEAR TO GOD.
YOU'RE...SMOKING HOT AND...FUN
AND...SOULFUL AND...
age-appropriate.
and BUT WHAT?
but...
sometimes THE TRUTH SPEAKS FROM A PEACEFUL PLACE.
it's TAKEN ME A LONG TIME TO FIND THAT PLACE,
but I THINK I HAVE,
and IT'S TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME.
I'm SO SORRY.
you LIVE IN A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.
Yeah, I HAD NO IDEA.
I'm USUALLY PASSING BY AT 35 MILES PER HOUR.
I'm NOT A REAL BIG WALKER.
everybody WALKS IN LONDON.
of COURSE, THEY'RE USUALLY WALKING TO THE PUB.
how FAR ARE WE GOING?
Oh, YOU'RE A BIT GRUMPY TONIGHT.
what's WRONG?
come ON. DON'T CLOSE UP ON ME NOW.
no, I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.
I MEAN, THANKS TO YOU, THINGS ARE...
actually LOOKING UP.
some PEOPLE AT WORK HAVE BEEN...AFTER ME.
I THINK I HAVE 'EM UNDER CONTROL.
so, WHY THE GROUCHINESS?
is IT BECAUSE YOUR SISTER THINKS I'M A TROLLOP?
it's NOT JUST...DEB.
it's THE SUDDENNESS OF ALL OF THIS
losing RITA, THE KIDS.
they've BEEN THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME HUMAN
for A LONG TIME.
were THEY KEEPING YOU HUMAN, THOUGH,
or WERE THEY THE ONES MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE THE MONSTER
that YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?
keep GOING.
your FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE TO ACCEPT YOU
for WHO YOU'RE EVOLVING INTO NOW THAT YOU'RE CLEAN.
is THAT WHAT I AM
clean?
cause I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY AT ALL.
no, YOU CERTAINLY DON'T.
Mmm, GOD.
I WISH I COULD FUCK YOU RIGHT NOW.
whose HOUSE IS THIS?
couldn't TELL YOU.
God.
he's A MAN OF MANY TALENTS.
Ah!
look. I'M SOME OLD BITCH.
better NOT PRESS OUR LUCK. WE SHOULD GO.
Hello?
Hi, Dexter.
can YOU COME TO MY SCHOOL TOMORROW?
what's AT YOUR SCHOOL, BUDDY?
I'm doing my cultural report.
saudi ARABIA.
can YOU WATCH ME? I'M KIND OF SCARED.
Cody, what are you doing?
who IS THIS?
Hello?
who WAS THAT?
Rita's SON.
he WANTS ME TO COME SEE HIM AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.
Oh, POOR KID.
he DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE GONE.
I THINK I'LL GO.
whatever YOU THINK'S BEST.
Hey, GUYS!
I'm HOME!
Hello?
they're IN BED.
why SO EARLY?
Cody IS BEING PUNISHED FOR SNEAKING AWAY
to MAKE A PHONE CALL WITHOUT PERMISSION.
Astor JOINED HIM IN A MISGUIDED SHOW OF SUPPORT.
well, WHO WAS CODY CALLING?
the BOY WAS TRYING TO INVITE HIM TO HIS SCHOOL.
can YOU IMAGINE? OH.
mom, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK.
I MADE A PHONE CALL OF MY OWN TODAY.
I SPOKE WITH AUNT CECILIA.
she TOLD ME THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FIRED YOU ALMOST A YEAR AGO.
we HAD PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES.
the EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS FALLING APART.
school SHOULD BE LIFE ITSELF, NOT A PREPARATION FOR LIVING.
do YOU KNOW THAT THEY GIVE TROPHIES TO EVERY CHILD NOW
whether THEY WIN OR LOSE?
Yeah, I FINALLY GET IT.
it TOOK ME A FEW DECADES, BUT IT'S NOT JUST ME
nobody CAN DEAL WITH YOU.
you DON'T LEAVE ROOM FOR ANYBODY ELSE TO EXIST.
it's NOT MY FAULT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING
to SETTLE FOR MEDIOCRITY.
just LOOK AT YOU -- FIRST PAUL, THEN DEXTER.
Rita, YOU LACK EVEN COMMON SENSE,
and NOW YOU'RE PASSING THAT TORCH OF ORDINARY CHARACTER
on TO YOUR CHILDREN.
shut THE FUCK UP.
nobody TALKS ABOUT MY KIDS THAT WAY.
Thatagirl.
that's WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE.
Yeah! I'M DONE WITH YOU.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
but YOU GO -- YOU GIVE ME HELL.
no.
no, I WON'T DO THAT.
I WON'T LET YOU TURN ME INTO...YOU.
Rita -- HERE'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
first THING IN THE MORNING,
you're GONNA PACK UP AND GO HOME.
you'll COME AND VISIT US FOR BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS,
but YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE WITH US ANYMORE.
well...
...if THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SACRIFICE
to GET YOU ON YOUR FEET...
kill ONE MAN, AND YOU'RE A MURDERER.
kill THOUSANDS, A CONQUEROR.
kill THEM ALL, AND YOU'RE A GOD.
does IT SOUND TO YOU LIKE OUR GUY
has A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER,
a CLASSIC GOD COMPLEX?
I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING, ANGEL.
to TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY ALTER EGO HAD IN MIND WHEN HE WROTE THAT CRAP.
I JUST PULLED FROM VARIOUS BLOGS ON THE INTERNET, MIXED AND MATCHED -- PRESTO MANIFESTO.
you FINALLY DECIDED TO FIGHT BACK.
I BEEN WAITING.
hope YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO COMMENT ON THAT
so YOU CAN RECORD IT ON YOUR HIDDEN TAPE RECORDER.
I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY.
you MIGHT HAVE BEEN, FOR ALL I KNOW.
your PAST IS A BIGGER MYSTERY THAN FUCKING JIMMY HOFFA.
I TRIED EVERY AVENUE, LEGAL AND OTHERWISE,
but THERE AIN'T NO PAPER TRAIL
on THE EARLY YEARS OF DEXTER MORGAN.
I GUESS THERE'S NO RECORDER RUNNING, AFTER ALL.
no, MAN.
unlike YOU, I DO EVERYTHING OUT IN THE OPEN.
well, IN THAT CASE, SERGEANT,
let ME PUT THIS IN THE OPEN FOR YOU.
no MATTER WHAT YOU TRY, NO MATTER WHEN,
no MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORK,
I'll ALWAYS BE A STEP AHEAD OF YOU FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON.
and WHAT'S THAT?
I OWN YOU.
Aah!
Aah! FUCK!
get HIM OFF OF ME! GET OFF ME!
why ARE YOU DOING THIS?!
stop!
I WANT YOUR GUN, YOUR BADGE, AND YOUR POLICE I. D.
I WANT YOUR ACCESS CARD, TOO
now!
type A STATEMENT THAT SERGEANT DOAKES
is ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE,
pending AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION.
you TWO, GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
Thanks.
what THE HELL HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW. HE JUST...JUMPED ME.
that GUY'S ALWAYS HAD IT OUT FOR ME.
thanks FOR MEETING WITH ME, DON.
well, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POINT IS.
the DISTRICT COURT INJUNCTION HEARING STARTS IN THREE HOURS.
which EVERYONE HERE KNOWS WE'RE GOING TO LOSE.
don't LOOK SO SHOCKED. WE ALWAYS LOSE THESE THINGS.
you BASTARDS AND YOUR FREE SPEECH.
my BOSS NEVER LETS ME SAY ANYTHING.
I'll TELL YOU WHAT
I WILL AGREE TO DROPPING THE INJUNCTION,
which WILL SAVE US DAYS OF COURTROOM ARGUMENTS
and A BOATLOAD OF LEGAL FEES,
if WE CAN AGREE ON SOME SIMPLE GROUND RULES
on HOW YOU PUBLISH THAT DOCUMENT.
ground RULES.
we're NOT GONNA HAVE ANY GROUND RULES.
my ONLY GOAL HERE IS TO AVOID COMPROMISING AN INVESTIGATION
of A MASS MURDERER...
who COULD HURT A LOT MORE PEOPLE.
give ME JUST A SECOND, WILL YOU, FRANK?
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOT THOSE ASSHOLES
to PUBLISH THE MANIFESTO WITHOUT THE VICTIMS' NAMES
and AS A PAGE-3 STORY.
no SENSE HYPING IT.
it MIGHT JUST INSPIRE THE KILLER TO GREATER HEIGHTS.
wait.
it's QUIET HERE...
peaceful.
it's A GOOD SPOT.
for WHAT?
it's 1: 00.
so IT IS.
I BROUGHT MY OWN SANDWICH.
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE QUIET, MORGAN.
I DIDN'T.
I DON'T.
when I'M ALONE AND IT'S QUIET, I GET SCARED...
shitless,
like I START HEARING WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON INSIDE.
I SEE.
so IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU,
maybe I CAN JUST PRACTICE WHEN YOU'RE AROUND.
okay.
cause WHEN YOU'RE AROUND,
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I CAN DEAL WITH ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?
like WHAT HAPPENED TO ME
I DON'T HAVE TO RUN FROM IT.
I DON'T HAVE TO JUMP INTO BED WITH SOME GUY AND HIDE THERE.
you GIVE ME STRENGTH.
I'm KIND OF OPENING UP HERE.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
I DON'T KNOW.
you're THE FUCKING ZEN MASTER. FIGURE IT OUT.
I've GOT PLAQUE IN MY ARTERIES.
I KNOW THE LYRICS TO ELEVATOR MUSIC.
my HAIR ISN'T GETTING ANY THICKER.
you're GONNA DO GREAT UP THERE.
you JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER SOMETHING
they're MORE FRIGHTENED THAN YOU ARE.
no, THEY'RE NOT.
are SO.
you're GONNA BE STARING AT THEM THE WHOLE TIME.
if ONE OF THOSE UNSUSPECTING MOMS OR DADS
does SOMETHING EMBARRASSING WHILE YOU'RE UP ON STAGE...
like PICK THEIR NOSE?
...you're GONNA BE THE ONE WHO SEES IT.
Yeah.
now THAT'S POWER.
now GO HAVE FUN.
Dexter, OVER HERE. WE SAVED YOU A SEAT.
Thanks, GUYS.
there YOU GO -- $18, 000.
I'll SEND A TRUCK FOR THE PIECE TOMORROW.
I AM TELLING YOU, LILA,
this IS GOING TO CREATE A CRITICAL MASS FOR YOU.
according TO THE PSYCHOLINGUISTIC ANALYSIS
of THE MANIFESTO,
our KILLER IS A WHITE MALE IN HIS 50s.
what ELSE?
uh, THE KILLER HAS NO GIRLFRIENDS
and CONSIDERS HIMSELF A GOOD CATHOLIC.
hold ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
how CAN YOU TELL ALL THAT BY PUTTING WORDS IN A COMPUTER?
I DON'T KNOW, DUDE. IT'S SCIENCE.
how 'BOUT COMMON SENSE?
I THINK THE GUY THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS PISSED OFF AT GOD,
and THAT'S WHY HE KILLS PEOPLE.
Really? I ACTUALLY FOUND HIM VERY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.
Yeah, LIKE A MODERN-DAY REVOLUTIONARY.
which WOULD SUGGEST THAT HE'S KILLING FOR SOCIAL CHANGE.
this IS WHAT HE WANTS.
what's THAT?
confusion, CHAOS
it's WHAT THE KILLER WANTS.
he's ALWAYS BEEN AN INTENSELY PRIVATE FIGURE,
dispatching VICTIMS SILENTLY.
now HE'S SUDDENLY A MEDIA WHORE? IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
he's CREATING A CLUSTERFUCK.
very GOOD, OFFICER MORGAN.
the KILLER'S MAKING US CHASE OUR TAILS.
you KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
he KNOWS HOW WE WORK.
look HOW HE HITS EVERY MAJOR THEME
political, ENVIRONMENTAL, RELIGIOUS.
in ONE SECTION, HE MANAGES TO WEAVE TOGETHER JULIUS CAESAR,
berlin, GERMANY, THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS, AND GANDHI.
it's SCATTERSHOT.
he KNEW THAT THIS WOULD SEND US SCURRYING
like SQUIRRELS FOR NUTS.
Yeah, BUT TO SUGGEST THAT HE MIGHT BE ONE OF US
how CAN YOU BE SURE?
Hi, I'M CODY, AND I RESEARCHED SAUDI ARABIA
for MY CULTURAL REPORT.
my BOARD IS COVERED IN SAND
because SAUDI ARABIA IS ONE BIG DESERT.
as YOU CAN SEE, I USED COFFEE BEANS TO WRITE "SAUDI ARABIA.
arabic COFFEE IS VERY FAMOUS.
I'm A LITTLE CONFUSED.
Lila IS THE ONE SHOWING ME HOW TO TAKE CONTROL, STOP KILLING, GET MY LIFE CLEAN.
but THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE I WENT INTO RECOVERY THAT I ACTUALLY FEEL CLEAN.
the CHILDREN IN SAUDI ARABIA ARE JUST LIKE US,
because THEY...
this IS THE SAUDI ARABIAN FLAG.
the ARABIC LETTERS MEAN "THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH.
do YOU KNOW HOW TOUGH IT IS FOR A WOMAN IN SAUDI ARABIA?
they CAN'T DRIVE OR HAVE POWERFUL JOBS.
or GET THIS -- THEY CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE MOVIES
without MEN'S PERMISSION.
after THEY TURN 12, THEY HAVE TO WEAR LONG BLACK SLEEVES,
and THEY CAN'T HARDLY EVEN TALK TO MEN UNTIL THEY GET MARRIED.
the NEW KING, ABDULLAH,
is TRYING TO CHANGE SOME OLD BAD RULES,
so WOMEN CAN DO MORE THINGS...
thank YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING.
or, AS THEY SAY IN ARABIC, "SHOKRAN.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW CALM YOU WERE UP THERE.
Yeah, YOU WERE LIKE A PROFESSIONAL TALKER.
you WERE PRETTY GOOD.
can DEXTER COME FOR ICE CREAM WITH US?
can HE, MOM, PLEASE?
UH...SURE, DEXTER CAN JOIN US.
I WOULDN'T MISS IT.
maybe THEY'LL HAVE SOME DELICIOUS SAUDI FLAVORS,
like SAND OR OIL.
hang ON A SEC, GUYS.
hello.
are YOU HURT?
O-okay, OKAY. I'M COMING NOW.
I KNOW. ME TOO.
come ON, KIDS. DEXTER WON'T BE JOINING US.
Rita, IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
look, I'M SO SORRY, YOU GUYS.
I'm GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU,
but I GOT TO HELP A FRIEND WHO'S IN TROUBLE.
there WAS A FIRE AT HER PLACE.
I'm SO SORRY.
Hey, LET'S GO.
what HAPPENED?
I WAS WORKING ON MY PIECE WITH THE BLOWTORCH,
and IT JUST CAUGHT FIRE. I WAS SO SCARED.
Oh, I GUESS SO.
promise ME THAT YOU WON'T LEAVE ME,
that YOU WON'T GO ANYWHERE.
I'm NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
Hey, YOU GOT YOUR LIGHT FIXED.
you can't run from who you are.
no matter how far or how fast you go...
to the ends of the earth and back again...
the shadow of your past is always just one step behind.
I tried to outrun it
changed my name, disappeared,
thought I could leave everything behind.
and here I am, right back in the mess
such is life.
I'll say it again. - Don't.
just go over there and make sure she's alone.
he has some kind of evidence he wants to turn over?
he's got 60 seconds to come out here
and give it to me himself, or I'm gone.
for the record, I told him I think he's doing this for the wrong reasons.
I think it's a bad idea.
don't care. 50 seconds.
you've got no idea what you're into here, do you?
I know you're Frank Murphy,
the Westland gang's chief enforcer
and number eight on the FBI's most wanted.
I know I'm violating six or seven different kinds of professional ethics rules by talking to you,
and I know I'm having serious second thoughts about it.
you're not what I expected.
I get that a lot. 30 seconds.
I'd been working to find and prosecute the remnants of the Westland gang for four years when this C. I. Contacted me, says he could help.
would you like to have a seat?
no, I'm fine. - I'm glad.
you make me a little nervous, you know. Please sit.
looks like someone wants your confidential informant
to keep his evidence to himself.
any idea who the shooters might be?
no. And I have no idea how they knew about the meet.
but whoever they are, they won't going away.
my car was broken into two days ago.
my trash has been torn through. My email has been hacked.
I deal with the worst of the worst In this city.
but this feels different.
you're afraid.
the police detail that's been assigned to me Is watching my back for now.
but I don't want someone who is just going to watch my back.
I want someone who is going to root these people out.
I'd like to introduce you to my security specialist. He's...
he's actually supposed to be here right now, But, um...
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me for just a moment, please? Thank you.
what-- what the-- Why are you？
the client I told you about is downstairs.
the assistant d. A?
Oh, yeah. Okay.
you realize that assistant d. A meet a lot of people who need our kind of help.
I mean, I get that in your world, a guy can take a nap at 2: 00 in the afternoon
and wake up underneath a pile of Chinese food
with a paying client just waiting downstairs.
my world requires a bit more planning, though.
so do you mind coming down And maybe we can close this job?
no worries.
sorry to bother you.
no. This one's mine.
Allyson Russo, this is Christopher Chance, My security specialist.
he's going to be the man on the ground with you.
now be assured there's no one in the world that's better qualified in personal security And threat assessment.
how you doing? - Hello.
now, the way we operate here Is based on The ability to blend in.
we let you appear vulnerable,
use that to our advantage in order to expose the threat.
Why?
why what? - You said he's the best, why?
I'm sorry, this is all a bit new to me.
and you have noodle on your shirt.
that's a bit of a complicated answer, you see-- - So who's your c. I.?
excuse me? - You got hit over a meeting with a c. I. , Who was it?
the "C" stands for confidential.
Oh. Is that what that stands for?
thing is, Less than a week ago, you had guys with assault rifles shooting at you.
they don't seem to be going away. In our business, we refer to that as a...
serious problem.
so you have to ask yourself what's more important to you,
being able to keep a secret or being alive?
why me?
I'm not a cop. I'm not a bodyguard.
I'm just here to identify your problem, solve it,
get you out cleanly with no loose ends.
but I can't do that unless you let me.
the c. I. is Whitey Doyle. - What?
hold on a second. Let me get this straight.
the man who led the Westland gang for 20 years and hasn't been seen in 10.
whitey Doyle, that's your c. I.?
don't ask me why. Maybe he has a guilty conscience,
maybe to settle an old score, maybe he's bored.
I'm not so interested in " Why" As I am "Why you" .
excuse me?
there are 20 other lawyers in your office. Why did he pick you?
because I'm the one going after his old soldiers.
who else is he going to call?
are you going to take my case?
well, between Whitey Doyle and whoever it was that mounted the assault on that bridge,
I think you're pretty much screwed.
of course we're going to take your case.
the last time those guys shot at you was your first meeting with Whitey Doyle.
the best way to lure them out is to arrange a second one.
this is your plan? - Yeah.
to paint a bull's-eye on my back And see who takes a shot at me?
at us. Well, hopefully more me than you.
a lot of people survive your plans, do they?
Oh, you'd be surprised.
look, I'm going to go in there,
tell them about the meet, and establish my cover.
from then on, I promise, I won't leave your side.
okay. Any way you can try and keep it cool in there?
Hey. It's going to be fine. Trust me.
good morning. Mark nelson, attorney for Wette Doyle.
are you Allyson Russo? - Yes.
Mr. Doyle would like to see you again.
so your client's a fugitive, But you're here to dictate the terms.
Yep. Term number one, all meetings happen At a place of my client's choosing.
term number two, full blanket immunity From prosecution.
and most importantly, number three, My client will deal with Ms. Russo And Ms. Russo only.
Mr. Nelson, why don't we discuss this privately?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Where do you get off?
I'm Allyson's supervise.
I will take part in any meeting with Doyle regarding he doesn't like you.
excuse me? - You're excused.
this office has been full of leaks for as long as you've been here.
he sees it as evidence of a character defect.
even if I agree to the demands, - The immunity deal will never hold up. - Sure, it will.
okay, why don't you just let me talk to him?
I can talk to him and get to the bottom of this. - No, hold on, hold on.
because I want to hear how Mr. Nelson thinks
he's going to get a judge to let one of the most wanted men In America off the hook in return for some vague promise of his testimony.
please. Educate me.
let's just-- - Todd vs. California
state Supremes upheld Blanket immunity for a notorious gang boss in exchange for the promise of testimony.
u. S. Vs. VAZQUEZ-- Similar situation with a drug-trafficking kingpin.
judge cone upstairs,
lead PROSECUTOR, CALIFORNIA vs. LEE-- Same deal.
but I'm sure this can't be a surprise to you.
or can it?
maybe that's why they keep passing you over for Kent's job down the hall.
okay. - Okay, okay, okay.
let's all just take a little breather here.
why don't we let these two talk this through, huh? Huh?
okay, so you are not a lawyer, correct?
not that I'm aware of.
then how did you know all that?
the legal stuff? I just made it up.
no. No, you didn't. Harris might not do his homework, but I do.
and those cases were dead on.
Really?
fine, but you have no idea how many people in this building Are going to be talking about this.
the building? I want everyone in the city talking about this.
we enforced our requirements, Force the bad guys to make a mistake.
Yeah. What'd you find?
Really? You sure, Winston?
okay, I'll check it out.
what was that?
when you hired us, I knew something wasn't right.
it seemed like a slam dunk. There was a leak in your office
somebody you were covering for, someone with some dirt in their past.
well, I was right. There is somebody with dirt in their folder,
but the thing is, it's you.
five years ago, your first major racketeering case, $50, 000 shows up in your checking account.
internal affairs steps in to investigate. Eventually they drop the case.
a little weird, huh?
I'm not on the take-- not now, not ever.
I don't think you are on the take. You don't seem like the type. But that's a lot of money.
is there anything you're not telling me?
I think I answered your question.
I want to get you moving, see who follows,
try to get the bad guys to make a move.
we called ahead, Got you a table where you two will be able to talk privately.
we'll do a quick sweep of the restaurant when we arrive.
should only take a minute or two.
sorry for the inconvenience.
inspector Gibson, I just want to tell you how much I appreciate everything you guys are doing.
Ah. Just doing our job.
Oh, there is one thing I wanted to mention About this morning, though I know it's probably not my place,
but, um, doesn't really sound like a good idea For you to meet with Doyle alone again.
no, it doesn't really sound like a good idea, Does it?
but there's too much at stake with this case.
and if meeting him can crack it, then it's worth the risk.
all right. Just saying, if we had been there the first time,
this problem would be over by now.
3 William 56, report. - Hey, you mind grabbing that?
3 William 56, en route to Matthew's grille with the package plus one.
Roger that.
I'm sorry, what did you mean by that? - Excuse me?
you said that if you'd been there, This would be over by now.
what did-- what did you mean?
well, we could've surveyed the meet
and, uh, made a move on the gunmen showed themselves.
Oh, I see. You could've kept eyes on the bridge,
made sure that it was clear.
exactly.
you didn't mention that the meet took place on a bridge - In your official report, did you? - No.
Yeah, well, it seems to me like inspector Gibson already knew.
did it seem that way to you?
Wow. This is awkward.
wait a minute.
you two were the gunmen on the bridge
that were trying to kill Whitey Doyle and Allyson. Right?
okay, now this is awkward.
looks like we figured out who's trying to kill you.
I don't understand. Why is this happening?
are you okay? - Am I okay?
police officers, whom I have spent my entire Professional life trying to defend, are trying to kill me.
Why? Why? We don't know. We don't know.
I'm being protected by a guy
who just strangled someone with a seat belt
and then threw him from a moving car.
and--and you're now in the process of trying to steal another car.
so you tell me-- am I okay?
you're fine.
I'm going to call my office, and they can put an end to this.
this is Allyson. - Put the phone down.
we need to go right now. Give it to me. Get in the car.
how did you know they were coming?
they're tracking me?
using you to get to whitey-- not a bad plan,
except for the part where you found out about them.
now Gibson has to kill you too.
how are they tracking me, my phone?
that's a good place to start.
let's start removing pieces of the equation until we can nail it down.
what are you doing? - Well, you told me to get rid of it.
I said remove it from the tracker, not throw it out the window.
guess it wasn't the phone. - Guess not.
next step, take your clothes off. - Excuse me?
clothes off now. There's a tracker on you somewhere.
we're never going to lose these guys unless we find it.
you're kidding me.
I'm really not.
call my office.
Yeah, five cops tried to kill you. I'm not sure who we can trust there.
Yeah, listen, it's me. I've got another development.
the gunmen on the bridge, they were cops.
they blew their chance at whitey,
but they got themselves assigned to her security detail after the fact.
I got names and badge numbers,
including an inspector named was Gibson.
only five cops probably isn't just five.
there's a good chance there's more iceberg there.
you still got that buddy in I. A?
Yeah, I'll call him right now.
why don't they use their sirens?
well, why make a scene when he's got the tracker?
Gibson knows he won't lose us. He knows we can't run forever.
he can just hang back, wait for us to stop, and then they got .
eyes forward, please.
Oh, this is bad.
the tracker's still pointing at me.
I was afraid of that.
that means the tracker's not on you, it's in you.
in--in me? That sounds like a problem.
Yeah, it does. Look, I know somebody who can help us.
we just need to stall for a little bit of time.
what are you doing? - I'd suggest a seat belt.
I don't like this plan. I really don't.
we haven't even gotten to the good part yet.
not bad. - It's not my first time.
could you put some clothes on? It's distracting.
Hey, dude. - Hey.
thanks for dropping everything to help us.
you caught me at a good time. Just finished shampooing out the trunk of my car.
so somebody's tracking you?
why isn't she naked yet?
we tried that already.
interesting. - And who are you?
uh, Allyson, Guerrero. Guerrero, Allyson.
nice to meet you.
all right, let's get to work.
al, hey.
how are you doing, man?
good to see you. Thanks for coming down to see me so quickly.
so what's so important you couldn't talk about it over the phone?
Oh, my client's kind of in the thick of it right now.
she got a couple dirty cops on her tail.
I'm just trying to figure out how deep the whole thing goes.
sure thing. Just give me a name, and I can get into it.
who's your client? - An A.D.A., Russo.
she contacted Whitey Doyle, had him ready to talk.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
well, wait, what do you mean you can't, ah? This is your job.
don't tell me how to do my job, you of all people.
what are you afraid of, man?
Doyle had his fingers in every corner of city hall
cops, D.As, judges.
he had people on his payroll at every level,
among them, a handful of cops that carried out the real rough stuff
witness intimidation, assassination.
Wes Gibson was the head of that crew.
okay, then. Help me take him down.
you can't. He's a star inside the department.
his history with Doyle is common knowledge in the I. A.
but the rank and file, they don't want to believe it,
or their names are in whitey's ledger too.
so what am I supposed to do now-- Just cut this woman loose?
not for nothing...
but we're pretty sure her name's in whitey's ledger as well.
you know about the investigation we ran,
those deposits showing up in her accounts.
hold on. "Deposits"? Plural?
someone dropped thousands a half a dozen times into her accounts just after she became a D.A.
tell her to turn herself in, hope for the best.
if she does that and the wrong cop gets ahold of her,
she'll be dead before she hits the station. Come on, Al.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand how they could have implanted a tracker.
I haven't been to the doctor in months, and even then,
it's just routine exams because I hate...needles.
what the hell is that?
Oh, come on, man can you put that stuff away?
what? If it's just under the skin, I can go in and get it.
no, no. No, no, no, no. No one's going in and getting anything.
you tell him nobody's going in to get anything.
Guerrero, let's find out what we're dealing with before the knives come out.
all right. Extremities tend to be the easiest place to sneak these things in,
but quick pinprick, that thing goes right in.
and I'm telling you, I haven't been around any needles.
that's what they all say.
Oh, dude.
think we got our device.
ingested? - Certainly looks that way.
they fed it to me? - Yep.
good ones are, like, the size of a grain of rice.
stays in your system for about a week or so.
can we remove it? - Uh, surgically.
we don't have that kind of time.
how are we going to get away from them - If they know how to find me all the time? - We can't.
we can if we pull over and let her out.
not helpful. All right, just let me out.
I know a guy. He might know how to jam the signal.
call me as soon as you find anything. - All right, buddy. Nice to meet you.
tell me some good news, please.
Nope. Apparently city government is filled up with people who'd love nothing more Than to see Allyson disappear today.
whitey Doyle had dozens of them on his payroll,
and they have a lot to lose If that ledger of his ever comes to light.
great, so I just need to get my hands on whitey's ledger Before Gibson does, or this never ends.
well, our current situation isn't going to make it any easier to get Doyle to show his face.
Oh, and, um, just to add insult to injury,
apparently I had it wrong about the investigation into her finances.
it wasn't just one incident. It was a half dozen.
I. A. just rolled them up into one case.
somebody tried to put money Into her account six times And she kept returning it?
that's what I'm hearing.
let me call you back.
we've got a new destination. We're going to see Whitey Doyle.
in the middle of all this? He'd never agree to it.
maybe not for most people, But for you, I think he'd make an exception.
what are you talking about?
if somebody tries to put money in your account once, I'd say it's a bribe.
six times, that's something else.
you sleeping with him? - Just leave it alone.
leave it alone? I can't leave it alone.
I need to find this guy today. We need that ledger.
and there's something you're not telling me.
it doesn't matter. He's never going to come out of hiding.
it doesn't matter. What doesn't matter?
do you have pictures of him? He has pictures of you?
what makes him want to pay you off, come out of hiding after ten years?
he's my father.
whitey Doyle is your father? - Yes, sort of.
Oh, sort of is an option?
uh, there's no official record of it. He split when I was two.
I barely remember him.
I woke up one morning. My mom was crying. Never saw him again.
when he left, we moved, And my mom and I never talked about it again.
it was a secret, but it was always there.
well, you're going to see him again today.
we can't. - Why not?
because we'll lead Gibson right to him.
no matter how long we run, they're always going to be One step behind us.
the only way to end this thing for good
is to get some evidence on Gibson and his men
whitey's evidence.
I can't get to him directly.
what did you do last time?
Frank Murphy-- he reached out to me.
but after he was shot at the bridge, I did some digging,
and there's a doctor at St. Paul's Who handles things quietly for whitey and his people.
maybe Frank's there.
the Parisian hotel Is about two blocks east, right?
Yeah, why? - If we get a taxi, we can get to St. Paul's quicker.
what's wrong with this car? - Nothing, but we need to buy some time.
let's go.
yeah? - You were wrong.
about what? - She's Doyle's kid, Al.
look, this isn't some crooked a. D.A. getting what's coming to her.
this is a good woman who's trying to do her job,
and she needs your help.
al, you remember when I left the force
I said I wanted to be free to do what was right,
with no b. S.no egos in the way?
you remember what you said to me?
you said one day you'd join me. I'm thinking today's that day.
where is she now?
she's on her way to St. Paul's hospital To pick up Whitey Doyle's ledger.
she needs to get to the courthouse.
I'll call Pamela Heard.
if there's one judge in this city that's not tangled up in this mess, it's her.
I'll take my best men and meet her.
make sure she gets to the judge safely.
so what's the deal with the money?
around the time I became a D. A. my mom got lymphoma.
the bills piled up.
and just before it got really bad, - 50 grand turned up in my checking account. - Whitey put it there.
and I returned it every time. I reported it as bank errors.
Why? - Because the hell with him.
he's a bad guy,
a guy I don't want or need anything from.
I sold everything I owned. I went into debt.
and I just barely managed to cover her expenses.
in less than 48 hours, you got me talking About the one thing
I haven't talked to anyone about In my entire life.
saw your underpants too.
you spent your entire professional life
trying to put people like your father behind bars.
you lied about your past, where you came from.
maybe it's okay to talk about it now.
maybe it's okay to stop running away from who you are.
so far today, you hijacked a moving car,
you nearly caused a catastrophic traffic accident,
and you picked a fight with a city Full of angry, desperate cops.
something tells me you're just getting started.
what's your point?
what are you running from?
it's going to be coming up on the right. We'll get off right up front.
how long till they're on to us?
tracker shows location, not altitude. They'll probably search floor to floor
two to four minutes each.
let's hope Murphy has a good view.
here to see Omar.
Hey, dude. Need some help.
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
this is time-sensitive. I need you now.
Yoh, wait your turn, man.
this'll only take a minute. - You better wait like I told you to
there's 600 amps running through this thing,
so unless you want it running through you too, - I'd watch the sudden movements. - Thank you.
listen, dude, What do you know about micro-gaps chips small enough to ingest without knowing it?
I warned you.
now shut up and let the man finish what he's doing
Really? What is the matter with you?
he'll be fine. Listen, a friend of mine's been tagged.
I need to know how to help her disable it, fast.
fast? - Fast. - Cut it out.
not an option. What else?
I don't know, uh... Wait for it to die on its own,
hide her inside a microwave oven, Send her to the moon.
but as long as that thing is working and she's on planet earth, satellite's going to see her.
why a microwave oven?
St
there are over 200 rooms in this place. He's under an alias.
you took one look at the patient roster, And you think you found him?
room 819, 62-year-old Caucasian male with a perforated abdominal tumor.
the surgery uses the same anesthesia and instruments As a gunshot to the stomach.
now, if I was a doctor and I wanted to keep things quiet,
that's exactly the cover that I would use.
but you're not a doctor. - No.
you aren't done enough already? You're back for more?
the men who shot at us on the bridge were cops...
crooked cops trying to stop whitey from turning over evidence of their corruption, and they're on their way up here right now.
you brought them here? - They tracked me here.
but I don't have to be here when they find me.
tell me how to find whitey.
tell me how to get my hands on that evidence, And I'm out of here.
about four minutes, they're coming through that door.
what if whitey won't help?
you have kids? - No.
I've heard you get pretty attached to them.
he's your father. He'll help.
she said she had nothing to do With the bridge.
give me that phone. You listen to me.
as far as I'm concerned, you are nothing but a criminal who's never had to answer for a single thing he's done.
is there a chance you get burned by helping me? Absolutely.
do I care? No.
you owe me For what you did. You owe me.
all I'm asking you to do is messenger the ledger over to the courthouse.
are you going to do it or not?
here, he wants to talk to you.
yeah?
where do you want the ledger sent?
the courthouse-- my office.
let's get you out of here.
give me whatever you got.
there's a good chance I wasn't walking out of this place, anyway.
I spent 30 years willing to take a bullet to protect the Doyle family.
like it or not, that's you too.
Hey, pal.
I thought I said nobody gets in!
good to see you, detective,
especially under the circumstances.
the evidence of your involvement with Whitey Doyle is on its way to the courthouse as we speak.
and there's no explaining this away.
we're here to take you in.
do you have any idea how many good people stand to be hurt If that ledger comes to light?
the people whose names are in that book Have a debt to pay.
and I don't care how many of them there are.
maybe you should.
so I should get used to seeing you around here, shouldn't I?
that's what I'd do. - Rvelous. What are you doing?
trying to figure out this tracker.
thing about these implants, They're just basically very weak microwave transmitters,
so implant puts out a signal, and this reader tracks it.
so if the little implant is close enough
to a much more powerful microwave source of the same frequency, then
it gets lost. - Exactly.
well, that's good for Allyson.
but how do we find a source with the right frequency?
turns out that might be easier than you think.
can you give me a straight
I can't believe he did that for me. I didn't even know him.
I don't think he did it for you.
I mean, after 30 years, I imagine whitey Was the closest thinning he had to family.
Murphy did it for him.
you know what? Let's not do this like family means anything to them.
whitey walked out on his actual family and never looked back.
maybe. Maybe he knew that sometimes the only way to keep the people you love safe is to walk away.
why are you defending him?
I don't know.
maybe I can appreciate his dilemma.
where are you?
en route to the courthouse, about five minutes away.
I need you to turn around.
what? The ledger's there. The judge is waiting for us.
your I. A. Buddy's going to escort us in.
he's dead.
I'm sorry.
went to the hospital to meet you. Gibson got to him.
they're going to pin the murder on Allyson.
look, they have cleared the area around the courthouse.
the place is going to be surrounded with cops.
they'll have an excuse to shoot first and ask questions later.
you're not going to get in the front door.
how's Guerrier coming with the tracker?
he's working on something. You want what he's got?
Yeah. Give me a minute.
maybe this was a bad idea.
maybe we should just turn around and keep running until we can find a safer option.
there are going to be cops all over town Gunning for you.
how far do you want to run?
what's the plan?
please tell me it doesn't involve driving the ambulance
right through the front doors of the building.
you ever try that?
trust me, it's not something you want to do twice.
put Guerrero on.
ambulance reported stolen. It's headed your way. Do you have a visual?
Yeah, I got it now.
if it fails cooperate you're clear to fire.
Hey, guys.
don't let that ambulance through.
look at that. The decoy worked.
I won't know who to trust in there.
trust me.
you ready? - Yeah.
I'm Allyson Russo. I'm here to see judge Heard.
we'll get her out quietly. Deal with it downstairs.
go.
bet you didn't know those things could broadcast the same signal They're programmed to receive,
even drown out weaker versions of the same signal.
tough break for you.
there's proof of all of this - a ledger of Doyle's payouts.
if you could have someone escort me to my office, It should be there.
there's no evidence in your office.
your evidence walked into my office about 20 minutes ago.
Hello, Allyson.
I brought the ledger...
corroborated everything with the judge here.
I think your problems are over.
they're going to put you in jail.
why are you doing this?
my little girl was in danger.
I'm everything you think I am
a crook, a thief, a thug.
there's never been any accounting for any of it.
and it occurred to me that, uh...
until that happens, there's one thing I can never be.
I'm 66 years old.
I- I don't know how many more kicks at the can I'm going to have.
it's time.
it's for you.
Hello?
so I guess you can stop running now.
Yeah, I guess so.
will you?
Wow. Things must be awfully interesting in your office these days.
over 60 indictments from whitey's testimony and ledger,
including Gibson and his crew.
they still haven't found him yet, huh?
no, nobody knows where he is.
there's a warrant out for his arrest,
but he could be halfway around the world by now.
Bye, dude.
what exactly is his story?
I honestly couldn't tell you.
so what do I owe you?
Oh, don't worry about that. It's been taken care of.
what? By who? No, no. No, I can't.
Oh, sure you can.
it's the least a man can do for his daughter.
besides, it'd be nice To have a friend down at city hall
we can talk to from time to time.
everybody we know down there is about to go to jail, so...
what's the matter?
Gibson is still out there.
afraid he's going to come after you for retribution?
I'm worried that this isn't over.
Delmar
there's something you ought to know about my associate.
he doesn't like loose ends
can you explain something to me about your associate?
he's not a lawyer, he's not a doctor,
and he's certainly not a cop.
what the hell is he?
you can't run from who you are.
you can't run from me.
we have a son together.
I want to hire a private investigator to find him.
if we're gonna be together... - wait. You want to be with me here?
you're kind of an amazing kiss .
I'm a cop, you dumbass!
I want back on the lacrosse team, Mr. Matthews.
I'm gonna have to ask you to take a paid leave of absence.
this is my job, harry. What are the students gonna think?
Jason broke up with me. My boyfriend from back home.
I don't think we can be friends if you're with Ethan.
I don't want to keep us a secret anymore, Ethan.
guys, guys, I heard they met over the summer.
Yeah, she's hot. I would definitely hit that.
her? What about him?
he's actually cute, in a... just-walked-off-a-catalogue kind of way.
they know? How do they all know?
didn't you get the text blast from George?
George? I blocked his number in eighth grade.
look at that - What's up, everybody -Dude, that's nuts.
when did this happen? - After Silver's party.
how much did you see?
I want details you - Dorks can't handle the details.
Oh, my god. George, you are so pathetic.
why don't you go back to rehab?
all right, people. Let's settle.
everybody take their seat. - So, Mr. Matthews has taken A... - Student's virginity?
leave of absence till we find a suitable substitute, I am your new teacher.
I understand we are working on Madame Bovary.
anybody want to tell me where we are? Anybody? Has she tried to kill herself yet?
Oh, God. Are you serious?
what? Are you serious?
um, when did this become the new principal's office?
Annie, thank you for joining us.
take your seat, so we can get started.
Annie. - Yeah?
you and me have to chat after school, okay? - Okay.
okay, then, Madame -- Right, it looks like we are on part three - I thought you were coming back tomorrow. - Uh, I took an earlier flight.
how are you? - Good.
aren't you supposed to be in class?
I have last period study hall.
and you're studying...
the hallway architecture. Thought it'd be a great art piece.
you know, the labyrinthine nature of the high school experience.
so? How was it? How's Dylan?
here, hold this for me.
well, Dylan is Dylan. You know, nothing's changed.
same cheekbones, same sideburns, same perfectly messy hairdo,and same cmitment issues.
I'm sorry. - Yeah.
how are you doing? - Actually, really good.
I'm okay with him being there and me being here.
just gonna leave myself in to all possibilities, you know look at you with your advanced self-understanding. - I'm impressed. - Don't be.
I'm still a work in progress.
Hey, I saw that Harry was teaching Ryan's class. Is he out sick or something?
Yeah. Um, you missed some stuff when you were go.
Mr. Matthews, what do you say about the allegations?
no comment.
sir, I'd just like to hear your side of the story.
Navid, I respect your perseverance. okay, I really but I said no comment, and I meant it.
now go back to class before I break your camera.
I'm sure that's not the best way to rehabilitate your image, sir.
Navid, you want to give me a brief quiet, turn that thing off
Ryan... it isn't true, is it?
it's complicated.
no, it either is true or it is the guy I knew before I left wouldn't do something like this.
I just want you to tell me the truth. I don't want to believe the rumors.
why are you just running away like this?
I don't know what else I can say. Sorry.
so Dixon tells me you're rockin' the karaoke at your birthday party. I'm so gonna make him sing.
cool. Whatever.
yo, what's you doing - Nothing.
nothing. I'm just... I'm supposed to meet Naomi, so...
chill. She doesn't know anything about you and Ethan.
you know? How do you know?
I saw you guys at my party.
Naomi was going to walk in on you and the jock strap, but I distracted her. You're welcome, by the way.
wait, wait, wait, how do you know that she didn't. Because you're still alive.
you got to tell her soon.
I mean if she finds out from some random, it ain't gonna be pretty.
um, Naomi, I...
I'm a mess. I'm sorry.
my parents... my mom filed the divorce papers today.
it's official. -- I come from a broken home.
um, I'm so sorry.
my parents throw in the towel, my relationship with Ethan is over.
I swear to god, if I get another piece of bad, and I'm going to lose it.
I'm going to really lose
is there anything that I can do at least I could use the support of my friends right you guys feel like hitting up Robertson this afternoon.
I actually have to go blog about professor pervert, you know, but...
maybe some other time? - Later.
how about you, Annie?
get our hairs did, followed by some retail therapy?
sure, ok. - thank you.
you really are a good friend.
Hey, girly.
poker game at Meaghan's house tonight. Are you in?
Oh, sounds like fun.
Oh, that's cute in a Hannah Montana on acid kind of so 16, huh?
God, you've had an intense year.
Oh, it's been a seriously crazy, new world, new school, new friends - No boyfriend.
Yeah. I have to talk to you about...
that's a really hard thing. Trust me, I know.
I mean, since I broke up with Ethan, I've been so lonely.
what were you saying?
I really don't like this dress.
so, did you break up with Jason before you left wizard of ox ?
no, after I got here.
Oh, were you the dumper or the dumpee?
it was mutual. I mean, you can't fight geography, right?
that's too bad.
sounds like you guys didn't really get a chance to see what would have happened.
I mean, maybe you'd still be together if you hadn't moved out here.
maybe.
I don't know, part of me felt like the break up wasn't real, you know?
when things end because of distance and not because of some big relationship problem it's kind of hard to get closure.
be great if you could get closure and maybe see him again, yeah, I guess.
that's the dress.
that's the dress you should wear to the birthday you'll never forget. Guess who?
soft hands...
velvet voice...
Oh, my god! So...
I've been thinking. - About?
about you and me. And the fact that we are an "us" now.
"us"? That is my new favorite word.
we should do something together. Like boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.
What'd you have in mind? Like lunch? maybe a movie?
I was thinking maybe something a little bit more private.
well, uh... That's... that's really not going to work.
why not?
I have a lot of footage to edit. And, uh, it's about Mr. Matthews. It's, it's a really, really big story.
Oh, well, then I'll help you.
that way we can be hanging out together.
well, the only thing is, um... I can't have anybody else around when I'm doing this.
I kind of need to focus.
okay, so I should just go, then?
I'll call you later, right? - Okay, yeah.
Thanks. - Have fun.
Matthews dips in the kiddie pool?
I think it's my best blog yet.
and I love it when my readers quote it back to me.
you're just biased against Matthews 'cause he dated your sister.
well, yeah. It's like, what if Ethan rebounded with someone from junior high?
why do I care who Ethan dates?
it's not like he's with...
Ethan's with Annie?
Yes, but Dixon, I'm the only one that knows.
you cannot tell her that you know or she'll think that I told you, you know?
and besides, they haven't told Naomi yet, and if she hears from somebody else...
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ethan, so I was thinking...
I don't know what you're getting Annie for her birthday, but let's make sure she has an amazing day, okay?
I don't want to give her a chance to miss Jason.
uh, why would she? They're broken up.
Yeah, but it sounds like Jason's a really great guy, and they were really close, kind of like you and me, so...
Yeah, she seems to be doing okay.
Yeah, that's what i thought until yesterday.
what happened yesterday?
we were shopping, and she could not stop talking about jason.
I guess because the breakup was long-distance, they just didn't get closure. i don't know.
I just don't want her to feel alone on her 16th birthday, so let's make it extra special, yeah?
cool.
Yeah, you gave me the facts this morning, but did you really have to fire him?
I had no choice.
did he admit anything? -it doesn't matter what he said.
how could it not matter? it's his reputation on the line.
Kelly, allegations were made. as principal, i had to act on them.
you're telling me that you believe that ryan slept with a student?
I can't get into this right now, kelly. you have to trust me.
uh, is this a bad time? i can come back later.
no. kimberly, i was just...leaving hi, kimberly, nice to meet you. please sit down.
apparently, i'm not allowed back into any more classes until you sign this.
uh, yes, i wanted to talk to you. please sit down.
if this is about mr. matthews, i'm fine. everything's fine.
an aura of fineness surrounds me. -i'm glad to hear that.
but, given the situation i have trouble believing that you're really okay.
that's your problem, not mine.
are you angry at mr. matthews?
did he give you a bad grade, maybe fail you on some test? -no.
were you in a relationship with him?
why are you asking me? i had nothing to do with this.
maybe you expressed some feelings that he didn't return.
sounds like you're speaking from your own experience.
I mean, it would be understandable.
everybody in your class loves him. he's young, dynamic, not unattractive.
okay, i don't want to talk about this anymore.
can i go?
if i'm late for mr. hunt's class one more time, i'll be in detention for life.
come back if you want to talk some more.
hello.
Hello?
yoo-hoo, annie!
boy, do we have a surprise for you. -hey, guys.
Annie, you will never guess who's here.
Jason hi, annie.
you could crush mint on those abs.
happy birthday.
jason...in california. right here in our pool.
um, what are you doing here?
I was hoping to meet lauren conrad.
are these the right hills?
I would hug you, but i wouldn't want to get you all wet.
I wouldn't mind. -tabitha.
surprise!
what a surprise it is.
do you like your birthday present?
he's from you? you're from her?
no, i'm from kansas, but naomi paid for the shipping labels.
your sweet 16 birthday is the most important day of your life, second only to your wedding day, of course.
and no girl should spend that day without a man by her side.
Yeah, but...
I-I told her that we weren't together, but when she called, i just couldn't resist a chance to be with you on your big day.
well, it's all right, it's very good to see you.
well, i'm gonna get going. i know you guys must have a ton to catch up on before dinner.
dinner?
Yeah. i figured you would want jason to meet all of your friends, you know, before the big day and everything.
you and silver are in, right? i have to call ethan.
I think that's about it. i'll take care of everything. don't you worry about a thing.
you are so lucky to have made such great friends here.
Yeah. so lucky.
Adrianna. hi.
Hello, half of navid's face. is the other half home?
it's not a good time.
well, then when is?
I've called you a couple of times. i've texted you.
tried to hook up at school.
you've gone all woodward and bernstein 'cause of this whole matthews story.
can we talk about this later, please?
no, we can't. you've been acting really weird lately.
wait.
is... is there someone there?
Yeah.
my baby sister iman.
Adrianna, uh...
iman, this is adrianna. -hi, sweetie.
Navid. is this the young lady you told us about?
welcome, adrianna.
we've heard wonderful things about you.
come on in. please, please.
dad, no farsi, okay?
she's pretty, navid. way too pretty for you.
please don't embarrass me. keep your voice down, okay?
Adrianna, it's so wonderful to meet you!
come in, come in. will you join us for dinner?
Oh, mom, i think adrianna already has plans.
Yeah. i wouldn't want to impose.
Oh, nonsense. you have to meet atoosa's family.
this is shah-lah and masood. -nice to meet you.
my cousin alex and my beautiful daughter shar-joon.
hello.
Hi. i'm adrianna. -anoosh, his cousin.
Oh, just shoot me now. -my brother-in-law iraj and his wife roza.
you hanging in there?
Oh, you know. just, uh...walking roxy.
nobody else wants to be around me right now, so...
I'd be there if i could. -roxy, come here.
but i guess i screwed that up for both of us for a while.
I really didn't think it was going to turn out like this.
I mean, i didn't... i didn't think.
maybe i deserve it. -no, you don't.
in a moment of extreme masochism, i decided to read silver's blog.
you want to know the worst part, aside from the grammar?
these kids...
they think i'm a sleazeball. they really do.
you know the truth. that's what matters.
I don't know how you do it.
how you spend your life letting people think you're something you're not.
look, ryan, i know you've risked a lot for me.
I swear to you, i'm going to close this case as fast as i can.
then everything will be back to normal.
I'll be around.
do you guys always eat dinner like this?
no. not usually this small.
can i tempt you with some more khoresht?
dad, please. she's had enough. -no, thanks.
I couldn't possibly eat any more. i'm stuffed.
but you're so small! you need to put some meat on your bones!
thank you.
so, navid, why didn't you tell me you play the drums?
or the doumbek? right?
Oh, and he sings, too. -what?
Oh, yes. -really?
when he was little, he'd sing all day long.
please tell me you have pictures.
better. we have video.
you wouldn't want to see them because they're poorly edited, and you'd be wasting your time.
honey, he's right.
what are we thinking, talking about movies in front of such a talented actress?
we should be asking you for details of your exciting childhood.
more importantly, adrianna, how are you doing since leaving rehab?
mom.
it's fine.
I know that must have been very difficult for you.
I'm great. i'm fine. really.
thank you.
mom-mom, do you happen to have any dessert? maybe something to tempt ade with?
of course, of course. lydia?
bring the desserts, please.
I'm sorry. -it's okay.
I will have an iced tea and the Japanese pear salad with tiger prawns dressing on the side.
always.
those little details, you never seem to forget, do you?
I still remember the way Ethan takes his coffee.
you guys dated? - Yeah, for a long time.
we managed to stay friends like you and Annie.
of course I stayed friends with Annie.
I mean, it's not just any girl whose idea of having a good time is sneaking into a jayhawks game.
Hey, just that once.
I thought security was going to throw us out on our asses but she managed to sweet-talk the guard into letting us stay
by saying that I was a foreign exchange student that was leaving in the morning.
true story.
seems like the silliest moments between couples are the ones that linger the longest.
so, Jason, is this your first time to California?
Yes, but, hopefully, not the last. I'm actually thinking about going to UCLA.
you would be in L.A.
Yeah. I'm going to check out the campus while I'm here.
just like we talked about.
that was a long time ago.
don't you have two more years before college? What's the rush?
I thought I told you. I'm a senior.
I need to decide soon.
Yeah, UCLA is almost impossible to get into, though, dude.
I mean, you have some backup schools lined up?
Jason is top of the class, all-state football.
ucla is his...
backup school - You're smart, handsome and athletic.
distance wouldn't be enough for me to let go of this one.
I'm parched. I'm just going to go check on that iced tea.
so, more details.
how long have you known Annie? - Since grade school.
we lived right around the block from each other.
seems like our lives always seemed to cross.
that is so sweet!
I got to go to the bathroom. Excuse me, please.
so, uh, anything new back home?
I know. I'm sorry.
Naomi planned this whole dinner before I knew anything about it.
I thought you weren't even in contact with Jason anymore.
I haven't been since we broke up.
did you guys actually break up or just take a break?
we broke up cross my heart. I was there.
then why is he considering colleges based on where you live?
look, we started dating in junior high.
Jason probably just assumed that we'd always be together.
and maybe because of the fact that we broke up on the phone, he didn't get enough closure.
Yeah, so I've heard. did you get enough closure?
Ethan, I want to be with you, nobody else.
then I think you should tell him about us.
I don't want to hurt him.
and he's only here for a couple of days and then he's gone. Why make him feel bad?
because I want him to know that we're together.
and I wanted Naomi to know the same thing, but you didn't want to upset her.
how is that different?
Hey, is everything okay? - Yeah, great.
good, well, your iced tea has arrived, so you don't have to really wait here for it anymore.
great.
you are becoming one of my all-time favorite customers.
Aw, aren't you sweet?
you're under arrest for drug possession with the intention to sell.
you gotta be kidding me.
come on. after all those times I hooked you up?
just can't trust anyone these days.
so do you want to do the ten years I can nail you on right now,
or do you want to vouch me to your boss?
give me a sit-down and let him know how I'm your newest dealer?
fancy meeting you here.
I know, nine bedrooms in the house and I still have to share a bathroom with Dixon.
Oh, poor Dixon, 'cause as I recall, you were never really good at sharing.
Hey, only where French fries are concerned.
you know, this isn't how I pictured us on the eve of your 16th birthday, but I'm glad I'm here.
it was nice of you to come.
Yeah, but weird, too.
Yeah, right? - Yeah.
I'm, I'm sorry. Does that mean...?
no, not at all. Actually, it's exactly what every ex-boyfriend / houseguest want to hear.
well, you know, even with all the weirdness,
I'm just glad to have someone to hang out with who doesn't make me feel like I have to try so hard.
what do you mean?
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's just I feel like I need to be so on all the time.
I mean, if they saw me hanging out in plaid pajamas, It'd be, like,"ooh, social suicide"
I'd forgotten how much fun you were to be around, Annie.
you're sweet.
you know what? That's a lie.
I didn't forget. I tried.
believe me, I tried.
but Annie, our relationship...
it was something special.
yo, Jason, Come on! let's go!
Hey, come on. I already set the game up.
we're battling some dudes from Michigan, and they already talking trash.
come on, man. let's do this.
good night.
Jason, can I get you anything else? - No, ma'am, thank you.
you know, when you're at UCLA, you should really come by and see us. - Absolutely.
now, do you need any recommendations? I'd be happy to write you one.
there is the birthday girl!
happy birthday. - Thank you.
I cannot believe that you are 16 years old.
okay, I am late for a photo shoot. Happy birthday.
good-bye, my love. Bye, sweetie.
Bye, Jason.
I got an early meeting as well. Happy birthday.
love you, too, baby. Nice to see you.
good luck on your tour. -Thank you, thank you.
uh, what are you gonna do, one of those star homes tours?
campus tour, UCLA.
if we're living close to each other again. Maybe things might work out a little different for us.
um, Jason, Um, I mean, who knows if we'd still be together if I hadn't moved?
maybe, Sure.
but we broke up, and I moved on.
so we're really over. - Yeah.
what about the kiss? I...
you totally took me by surprise.
and I am so sorry if I misled you in any way.
okay.
maybe I'll just go home.
no, please, Don't. stay.
I mean, the truth is, we were friends for a long time before we started dating, and I want all my friends at my party tonight.
so, come on. you can't deny a girl's birthday wish, right?
I'm sorry. I was awkward last night.
no, no, no, I'm sorry.
my mom had no right to bring up that whole rehab thing.
Yeah, she did. your parents paid for it.
but it's bad enough that they had to bore you with those stupid stories.
it was cute.
but how many servings of khoresht Do they expect one person to eat, right?
see, this, this is exactly why I didn't want you to meet my family because they can be lame at times.
well, actually, I thought they were lovely.
you're just saying that to be nice.
no, seriously, I wish my family was that big and close.
yeah?
so, yeah, obviously, I was a little embarrassed when your mom brought up the whole rehab thing.
but the fact that they knew the entire time,
and they still treated me like a member of the family.
that was incredibly cool.
so we are good.
I like you, Navid, okay? And the more I know, the more I like.
you just have to be honest with me.
about everything?
everything.
can you do that?
I'm a virgin. - What?
What?! - See, funny, right?
I didn't want to disappoint you, okay? 'Cause I figured you'd bolt, so, uh...
so you've been keeping your distance. - Yeah.
I wanted, I wanted it to be special.
I thought you expected something different, and you are so...
I'm not expecting anything.
no? - No.
except, um, A little less of that, um -- What's your mom's favorite dish?
Khoresht. -Khore, khore...
I can't say it! -Back of the throat.
Khoresht. Khoresht.
you got it.
Hey, Annie.
so, Jason seems like a pretty awesome guy.
he's clearly still into you.
maybe you guys should give it another shot.
Yeah, um, Naomi, about that, thank you so much for flying Jason in.
Hey, let's go out again tonight. It was so much fun last night.
we can go to the beach, maybe surfing.
let me get back to you on that.
Hey, are you still mad about last night?
define mad.
look, I know the whole having my current boyfriend go to dinner with my ex-boyfriend
when my current boyfriend isn't really a boyfriend at all. Thing is beyond the charts strange, but...
no, what's strange is being in a situation that's so complicated that we can't even tell people we're together.
does that make you happy? - No.
me, either.
I've done complicated, Jnnie, I didn't like it.
I want things between us to be simple, you know?
I want that, too.
great, then let's clean this whole mess up and tell Naomi and Jason the truth.
what?
I just, I just want to wait until Jason gets home to tell him.
Why? You don't still have feelings for him...
no, no.
um, no, but I think he still has them for me.
okay, don't freak out, but Jason kissed me last night.
perfect, yeah.
come on, Ethan. It just happened.
you know why? ' Cause he thinks you're still available.
I didn't kiss him back.
that was big of you. Have fun with Jason.
I never thought my star detention guest could be on time for anything.
only when it's important. This is important.
you know, you seem like a good kid.
seriously, dude, I don't want to hear it.
all I want to do is make some cash. - Get a job at Starbucks.
look, if you're not sure about me, then just say it.
Eric said he'd vouch for me and that you'd hook me up.
but if you bailed, then tell me now 'cause I got clients waiting.
you have no idea how long I've waited for this.
it takes a special kind of sleazebag to sell drugs to kids.
you're under arrest.
hands where we can see them.
thank you. No, no, seriously, thank you, Annie.
happy birthday. You're the best.
thank you, thank you, everyone for being here to celebrate my darling Annie's sweet 16.
Annie, I know this isn't the ordinary birthday dedication, but you're not ordinary girl.
that's why I love you.
Oh, my god, she is so amazing.
Oh, I know, right? She's totally rocking it.
Annie, I told you we should have gone first.
now we're going to get a vocal beat-down by grandma Wilson.
let's go find a song.
we'll be back. - We're gonna go make out.
darling. Karaoke...a surprising smash, Kansas.
so where's Ethan?
he must be running late, I guess.
you should call him. -No. um, don't worry about it.
gee, you'd think he'd be here.
okay, where is Ethan, anyway?
um, he might not be coming. We got in a bit of a fight.
but it's your birthday. - Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna go get some air.
don't you have a party inside?
I'm not really in the partying mood.
listen, I'm... really sorry, Annie.
you were nothing but honest with me about that kiss, and...
I was a jerk.
I would have gone with jackass, but okay.
the truth is, I had no right to get mad at you when I was the one who got us into this whole mess
by saying that we should keep Naomi in the dark.
Yeah, well, you didn't do it alone.
I tried to tell her a bunch of times and just totally chickened out.
and I guess I didn't have to hook up with you the minute you were on the rebound.
that's true. But I am glad you did.
there is going to be a cake soon, and on it, there will be 16 candles for me to blow out.
and my only wish is to be with you without all these secrets.
that's what I want, too.
Jason told Dixon he's going to leave on the red-eye tonight back to Kansas city.
so I kind of wanted to tell him the truth before he's gone.
and Naomi, too. - Okay.
happy birthday.
is it the pentapus?
so much for the element of surprise.
well, you know what, I'm kind of over surprises, so...
well, then I should probably just tell you that I'm about to kiss you.
you have to see this. Come here.
she really has moved on.
Annie swore to me that they weren't together. I can't believe she would lie like that.
I just... I can't believe...
I'm sorry.
looks like I caught you on your way out... of town.
what are, what are you doing here?
Harry called me.
so you know I'm not the devil.
I never thought that.
are you sure? 'Cause most people did.
so where are you headed? - Honestly, I don't know.
I'm just going to go to lax and let the fates decide.
Ryan, this will all blow over, you know that, right?
your real story will be in the paper. It'll be all over the news.
and you can go back to teaching.
I just need to get away, you know, take some time and clear my head.
you know, get out of town and figure out what I'm doing.
but thanks for stopping by. It was good seeing you.
maybe when you get back, we can get together.
kimberly, hey. - Hey, Kelly.
I can call you Kelly, right? - Yeah, of course.
am I interrupting something? - No, no. I was just leaving.
have a nice trip. - Thanks.
how are you doing? - I'm good.
do you think Naomi's up here? - Jared saw her go upstairs.
Oh, my god.
I...I... I can't believe this. How could you do this to me?
how could you do it to me is the question, Annie.
I saw you making out with Ethan at school.
wait, you...you knew they were together?
so, I just figured. Hey, if my good friend Annie, who I specifically asked not to date Ethan,
could make out with my ex. What's stopping me from fooling around with hers?
payback's a real bitch, isn't it?
An-Annie, wait!
you pathetic bitch.
after this, my mother's going to do her big closing number.
I think we should pull the plug on karaoke, and get out the cake.
Oh, but the kids really seem to be enjoying her. I mean, how bad could it be?
I think that it involves pasties.
I'll get the birthday girl.
I'm sorry, but I saw you and Ethan outside kissing, and it just freaked me out a little bit.
I mean, you could have told me that you guys were together.
why'd you hide that? - I...
I didn't want to hurt you.
so instead you played Naomi's game?
the girl that I knew back in Kansas was above that.
you don't understand, okay? The rules are different here.
but that doesn't mean you have to be.
I get to the airport.
I'm sorry if I ruined your birthday.
all right, everybody. Nicely done.
time to sing to the birthday girl.
sweetie, are you okay?
you... outside now!
any requests?
just so I am clear. Everything you have done-- the whole shopping trip,
flying Jason out here, all of that was just to set me up to ruin my birthday?
Absolutely. But if you want Ethan, you can have him.
I wanted to see you miserable and I got my wish. - That's sick.
Oh, don't give me that holier-than-thou routine. You're no innocent here.
okay, I should have told you about Ethan. I will grant you that.
I wanted to tell you. - But you didn't, did you?
no, instead you tried to play me for a fool. You backstabbing, duplicitous bitch!
okay, I was trying to spare your feelings!
I knew you would be upset, and so I was trying to find the right time.
but you didn't even like Jason, you just went after him to hurt me.
you deserved it.
I am so sick and tired of all you people who won't tell me the truth.
first it was my dad and his mistress, And then my mother with her son...
none of that was my fault.
all I know is that before you moved here, my life was perfectly fine!
no, before I moved here, you were just lying to yourself and getting away with it.
you'd rather have people fear you then be honest with you.
you're manipulative and cruel and the only person that you should be blaming for feeling so alone right now is you.
that all you got, Kansas?
listen to me.
being your friend -- I'm over it.
I already beat you to it. - Excuse me.
sorry to bother you ladies.
who are you? - Who are you?
my name's Sean. I'm the son of Harry Wilson and Tracy Clark.
Tim, it's milepost 112-9.
Roger that. MP 112-9.
dispatch, this is Desert Pacific Rail. Just passing MP 112-9.
we will be at the switch in five minutes.
got you, Desert Pacific Rail. What's your speed?
we are highballing at 20.
what are you pulling?
10, 000 tons of American ingenuity.
: all right.
I'll keep an eye on her.
do you mind?
you have an audience.
sorry. We're cool.
thank you.
pretty soon, that'll be you with a pretty girl like that. -No way.
William, what's wrong?
Hey, can I ride up front with you?
well, maybe on the return trip, okay?
you know you're not supposed to call me unless it's an emergency.
okay, Dad.
the flag's not up.
he didn't make the switch. -I know.
dispatch, this is Desert Pacific Rail. Do you read me? Over.
we're not going to make it.
I can't get it stopped.
dispatch, this is Desert Pacific Rail. Do you read me?
jump, Tim.
dispatch... -Tim, jump!
dispatch, San Jose Limited, coming your way.
dispatch?
young man...
I'm going to go see my dad.
you know you can't go up there when the train is moving.
he said I could... -William.
I may be old, but I ain't stupid.
what's going on up there? What's on my track?
stay in your seats! Hold on!
come on!
mom! William!
I got him!
I mean, when I started at the FBI, I figure, you know, I'm doing something good.
I'm fighting the fight.
it just sounds so...
old-fashioned. It just sounds so naive now.
no, no. It doesn't.
it's all just one big compromise.
I'm telling you. One big personality clash with redundant paperwork.
the boss is second-guessing every move, second-guessing their bosses, everyone just trying to keep their job.
nobody's got any guts.
Yeah, well, you got guts.
I feel lost.
I feel like...
I don't know why I'm in it anymore.
who's winning?
actually, uh, I got to get out of here.
Yeah. Eppes.
I'm so tired, I could sleep standing up.
the stakeout was worth it.
I loved the look on that guy's face when we sashayed in there instead of that teenage girl.
we got two days away from the creeps. You goany plans?
whatever sport is on TV.
got a train crash.
call NTSB. -They called us.
possible hazardous materials. High threat, urban area.
by hazardous materials, you mean old computer batteries?
no rest for the weary.
I want to know what was on every one of those trains, so e-mail me that waybill, ASAP.
send it to my phone.
you think we're dealing with anything toxic here? -Still checking.
we might have to evacuate the entire area. The press is going to be all over this.
LAPD's got 'em blocked off a mile away.
where do you guys need us? -What do you think?
I could use the manpower. -You got it.
why don't you go see if you can find the NTSB, and you go with him, all right?
Hey, I got her.
I got her. Let's go.
easy, easy... easy.
we're setting triage up over there. -Okay. I'll bring more over.
anybody in there? Oh...
anybody in here? -David! Get out of here!
there are people inside... -We've got a toxic leak!
there's a toxic leak!
everyone, get away from the train!
I have a press conference to do in ten minutes.
all right. So what do you need?
we've still got dozens more people to pl out.
we're going to have to go for the numbers.
got to save as many lives as possible.
listen, there are still passengers here in this car underneath the leaking tanker.
by t time we get to them, they'll be dead.
look, let me just see what my guys can do, all right?
over here! A problem!
okay, so who knows what? Talk to me!
sheriff's Department is evacuating a five-mile radius around the site.
then you guys should go help FD with extractions on that tanker.
what's the chemical? What do we need to know?
methyl isocyanate.
it's used in the manufacture of polyurethane foam, pesticides and plastics.
that's the same chemical that killed over 3, 000 people in Bhopal, India.
it's basically a weapon. So how bad's the leak?
well, if it's bad, we're all dead. Yeah.
hazmat measured two parts per million-- not fatal.
if you start tearing up, or start to smell something sweet, that indicates four parts per million, in which case, run.
but even small amounts could be lethal to the wounded people, right?
it's transported in liquid form.
when it hits the air, it vaporizes but, with water, it overheats and combusts, releasing a toxic cloud.
we need to get those people out of here before this thing explodes.
all right. Let's go. -You guys be careful.
so the black box is basically destroyed. It's not going to help us.
trains are monitored by computer-- I'll get the electronic records from the company's hard drive.
see if you can find out who knew that cargo was toxic.
and dog the bomb squad until we know what set it off, right?
I need a list of all National Security events in the last 24 hours.
are you thinking terrorism?
go. Go.
Yeah, I'll hold.
excuse me. Are you in charge?
we're not quite at the level of rogue, shape-shifting nanobots as described in science fiction.
however, we have made progress in the real world-- swarmbots.
alone, unsophisticated machines.
but, working together, with something like... like intelligence emerging.
these are crash investigators.
here. Check it out.
so I program a task for the swarm, right?
let's say I'm mapping this room, and they try to accomplish the goal of that task.
right now, they're self-organizing. They've chosen a leader.
see, some jobs need centralized control. Others require swarm activity.
Hey, Charlie, what happens if I shoot the leader?
they figure out who the next best leader is.
see that?
look. They just keep going.
it's much more robust and cooperative in a hostile environment than people.
you're familiar with eusocial insects like bees and ants and termites.
well, they communicate through pheromones-- scent clues.
Like,"I'm a larva. Take care of me."
Or,"Food's this way." Or,"Danger! Attack!
following smells is called chemotaxis.
my bots employ infotaxis, which is a spatial search algorithm in which agents repeatedly update guesses of an object's location.
each bot creates a model of its local environment, it networks it, and we get a collective picture.
these things could map my crash? -That's what I'm saying.
I can reprogram them, I can add lipstick cameras and chemical sensors.
the switch wasn't right.
we couldn't stop in time. -Why not?
it's a redundant system, but everything seemed to fail at once.
Cutty exerted the right amount of brake pressure for the tonnage, but the train just kept going.
tell me about your engineer-- Cutty Nagim.
he wouldn't abandon the train, even though we were sitting on 2, 000 tons of diesel.
did you recover the body? -Not yet.
what kind of name is Nagim?
syrian, I think.
did he have ties to Syria? Was he political?
I'm going to find all this out. You might as well just say what you know.
Cutty was born and raised in America.
you know what, Tim?
maybe all the parts in your redundant system just happened to fail at the same time, but that passenger train missed piercing a tanker carrying a lethal chemical by about ten feet.
Oh, that's just a matter of time, Agent.
scary hazardous materials roll through L. A. every single day on 100-year-old tracks with rusty, unguarded switches.
it's a miracle it hasn't happened up to this point-- a miracle.
stay put.
Hey, thanks for coming.
Yeah, uh, so where should I set up? -In here.
I'm downloading the railroad's electronic records. -Okay.
this is much worse than I thought. I don't knowf my bots can make a difference.
Charlie, the people we're going for are the lost causes.
anything we can do for them is better than nothing.
Hey, what's the chemical count?
it's the same-- two parts per million, but they haven't located the leak yet.
how many we got in here?
six remain that are still giving off body heat, but they're buried deep inside.
