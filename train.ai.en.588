it would be a mistake to think of geo-engineering as a substitute for curbing carbon-dioxide emissions-not merely because of the acidification of the oceans, but also because if you ever stop fertilising the oceans or spraying the atmosphere or whatever, the problem will rapidly return.
it would be a mistake, though, to think that the problem is confined to the gulf.
it would be a momentous event.
it would be a move of absolute desperation.
it would be a new fundamental force, one that rears its head only at vast cosmic distances.
it would be a nice irony if the best hedge against a collapse of the post-industrial economy turned out to be a return to the agrarian past.
it would be a particularly bad deal for cathay because cathay's existing life insurance business already suffers from weak profitability, and "nan shan's profitability, meanwhile, has been volatile over the past few years," ms yim says.
