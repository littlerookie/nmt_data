I know. I know, but - but maybe we don't have to go away.
I know. I know, but I brought it to you so you could destroy it.
I know. I know, but I didn't know what else to do. I had to run it out.
I know. I know, but I flashed.
I know. I know, but I want you.
I know. I know, but I'm dealing with some other shit right now, so...
I know. I know, but at the end of the day,
I know. I know, but look, we're here now, so...
I know. I know, but there's more to me than just being a performer.
I know. I know, but, uh... Wait.
I know. I know, but... I was young, and I thought -
I know. I know, dad.
I know. I know, dad.
I know. I know, darling that's all right
I know. I know, darling. That's all right. I went through quite a funk after I had you.
I know. I know, grace. it's... It's gonna be okay.
I know. I know, honey.
I know. I know, honey.
I know. I know, honey. I know. She could die, and I'll never...
I know. I know, it didn't feel right. Sorry.
I know. I know, it's shocking to find drug dealers shooting each other over money.
I know. I know, mom, but I just think with you sick, maybe it's not a good time.
I know. I know, mom, but I just think with you sick, maybe it's not a good time.
I know. I know, mom.
I know. I know, sergeant.
I know. I know, sergeant. Here are my orders.
I know. I know, sweetie, you're almost there.
I know. I know, sweetie. It's okay, but you gotta go, okay? All right.
I know. I know, we actually have customers.
I know. I know. that's what I told her.
I know. I know. - It's not funny. Seriously, get away from me.
I know. I know. - but it was from her dad.
I know. I know. - have you ever made love...
I know. I know. - he's gonna throw their performances off.
I know. I know. - okay. Can I drop you off at home now?
I know. I know. Also gay.
I know. I know. And normally, I wouldn't do anything like this.
I know. I know. And that's why I called my dad.
I know. I know. And the Swiss are fuming.
I know. I know. And we are prepared to leave if the situation warrants it.
I know. I know. But I got a text message from Chad.
I know. I know. But I wanna do this right.
I know. I know. But I've got something that's going to make you even happier.
I know. I know. But I... I... There is a silver lining.
I know. I know. But in this world, that's relatively cheap.
I know. I know. But it was from her dad.
I know. I know. But it's not.
I know. I know. But nothing happened for years.
I know. I know. But there's good news.
I know. I know. But, uh... But keep working on it. Okay.
I know. I know. Come on.
I know. I know. Don't even say.
I know. I know. Fine.
I know. I know. Guess. I know the guy.
I know. I know. He does.
I know. I know. He stuck to his cover. I know this.
I know. I know. He's gonna throw their performances off.
I know. I know. He's so selfish.
I know. I know. Hey, hey.
I know. I know. Hold on.
I know. I know. Honey. And I love you for that.
I know. I know. Honey. But it's a waste of time. All right?

I know. I know. I appreciate it. I'm sorry.
I know. I know. I could be getting at least 800. But what am I gonna do?
I know. I know. I could see it.

soot covers you head to toe as you chip away hour after hour at a precious black deposit that the world above you needs not just for warmth, but to keep things running.
soot from diesel exhausts, combined with soot from wood burning or old cooking appliances results in an estimated two million premature deaths per year-many of which are concentrated in the poorest countries-those much closer to the source of the problem.
soot from india has been found in the maldive islands and on the tibetan plateau; from the united states, it travels to the arctic.
soot hangs around for just a few days; but also absorbs heat and, when it falls to the ground on snow-covered mountain ranges, increases the amount sunlight abosrbed, which makes snow and ice melt faster.
soot has a pivotal extra effect, too: it settles on glaciers and other areas of ice, darkening their surface and increasing the rate at which they melt.
soot is usually the product of the imperfect combustion of fuel.
soot likewise offers an opportunity to marry local interests with the global good.
soot sticks to anything it touches.
soot was cause for a different concern in another recent study.
