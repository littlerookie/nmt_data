In 1366,Zhu began to build a wall around the city of Nanjing to defend it from attack. The Gate of Gathering Treasure (Zhonghua Gate) was built on the site of a previous gate,the south gate of the city built during the Later Tang Dynasty. The new gate,the grandest among the 13 gates of the new castle,was an architecturally complex structure composed of 3 closed courtyards and 4 archeddoors serving as the entrance. There were double paneled wooden doors and with additional stone door set behind. If the enemy broke through the wooden doors,they could be separated and trapped in the 3 closed courtyards upon dropping the stone doors.
