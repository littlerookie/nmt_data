I was surprised you called at all, you know?
like, your depression thing. I get it. I'm totally... totally worried.
after a while, it's like, she's still bumming?
and I'm going through stuff too, you know?
like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends"?
that's hard, you know?
what's up, guys?
where you going?
keep walking.
this is dangerous.
dude, come on.
I think, I know those guys.
well, they seem great. Can we go?
I just need to see something.
Hey, girlie!
alright, alright! We got a taker.
turn around.
sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
that's cool! I'll be whomever you want to be, honey.
so, what do you say?
you promised me nothing reckless.
you promised, it would as you never existed.
you lied. - Say some, babe?
you know what? Never mind.
stop!
stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey, um, what the hell is wrong with you?
just curious.
I thought that I saw something.
you're insane, actually. Or suicidal.
that homeboy could have been a psycho.
I was about to end up in a FBI interview room, like some lame TV show.
Oh, that was such a rush.
awesome!
so, you're an adrenaline junky now?
that's cool! You can go bungee jumping.
you don't get on the back of some random loser's motorcycle!
crazy!
Alice, I saw him.
maybe I'm crazy now, but I guess that's okay.
if the rush of danger is what it takes to see him...
then that's what I'll find.
Bella!
where the hell have you been, my god!
I... brought you something. - Okay.
it's a little crazy.
wow, scrap metal!
you shouldn't have. - I saved them from the junkyard.
I think, they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth.
but then I thought that...
if I had a mechanic-type friend to help me out...
huh, me?
being the mechanic-type friend? - That's right.
since when are you into motorcycles? - Since now.
I get it if you think this is really stupid and reckless.
Yeah, it's completely stupid and reckless.
when do we start?
now. Please. - Alright.
Oh, hey, be careful. These things are actually really...
heavy. So...
jacob, you're like buff.
how that can happen? You're like 16, I don't get it.
age is just a number, baby. What, you're like 40, now?
feels like that sometimes.
that song was good. You don't like it?
I don't really like...
music anymore kind of...
okay. No more music.
I was thinking, if we're gonna do this everyday, and hopefully we will...
we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere.
I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you.
you influence me? Please.
are you...? I'm older than you.
so that makes me the influencer and you the influence.
no, no, no.
my size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you.
because of your gentle paleness and lack of know-how.
I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me.
don't you think that makes you funny, young and naive?
okay. So, where do we stand?
I'm thirty five...
and you might be like 32. - Come on.
yo, Jake, you in there? - No, it's okay.
it's... It's just my boys.
Hey, Jake. - Hey. Guys, this is Bella.
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
I'm Quil Ateara.
so the bike building story is true.
Oh, yeah, yeah! I taught him everything he knows.
what about the part where you're his girlfriend?
uh, we're friends, you know? - Hmm. Burn!
actually, I remember, I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, do you remember him making that distinction?
Nope!
so you guys have girlfriends. It's awesome.
Yeah, right.
Quil's actually taken his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot.
you want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.
Jesus!
I got five bucks on Quil. - You're on.
dear Alice, I wish, I had your real address.
I wish, I could tell you about Jake.
he makes me feel better.
I mean, he makes me feel alive.
the hole in my chest while when I'm with Jake,
it's like, it almost healed. For a while.
Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.
Oh, I'm really not into the whole cougar thing, you know?
what's up with you and age?
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy anyway?
but even Jake can't keep the dreams away.
Hey, Bella!
you're alright. You're okay? - No.
I thought this thing was starting to work, but I guess not.
can I ask you something?
hanging out with Jacob...
does seems to take your mind off things for a bit, doesn't it?
you know, sometimes...
you gotta learn to love what's good for you.
you know, what I mean?
of course, what do I know?
I'm just a terminal bachelor.
famous ladies man.
okay...
go to bed.
I love you.
if I told you,
I couldn't have fixed these bikes, what would you say?
are you doubting your mad skills?
no, definitely not. I mean, they're all fine.
it's just...
may be if I was smarter would have dragged out to rebuild them.
if you told me, you couldn't fix these bikes.
I would say that... that's...
really too bad but...
we're gonna find something else to do.
is that Sam Uley?
Yeah, and his cult.
Oh, my God!
did you see that?
they're not really fighting, Bella.
they're cliff diving.
scary as hell, but a total rush.
rush? - Most of us jump from lower down.
we'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
is some kind of beef with them or something?
Oh, no.
they just think they run this place.
Embry used to call them "hall monitors on steroids."
now, look at him.
that's Embry?
Yeah. - What happened to him?
he missed some school...
and all of a sudden started following Sam around like a little puppy.
same thing with Paul and Jared.
Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something.
it's kinda starting to freak me out.
well, you should just avoid him.
I'll try.
okay.
you look scared. - I'm not.
alright! Brake.
clutch. Good.
gas.
ready?
now slowly... release the clutch.
stop.
you alright?
I'm gonna go again.
hit the brake!
I wanna go again. - Are you trying to get yourself killed?
I'll try again. - No, forget it.
no more bikes.
man, your head.
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
you're apologizing for bleeding?
Yeah, I guess, I am.
it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.
what are you staring at?
you're sort of beautiful.
how hard did you hit your head?
I don't know.
let's go.
I did see something in the woods. - Sure, baby, I believe you.
no, he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.
it was jet black and huge.
on all fours, it was still taller than a person.
a bear, may be?
or an alien. You're lucky that you didn't get probed.
Oh, yeah.
well, I saw it.
you're not the only one.
my Dad's been getting reports at the station.
like five hikers been killed by some bear.
but they can't find the bear.
last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
so, I mean...
Bella is back.
Yeah, I guess so. - Huh, that's... Welcome.
so listen, not now that... You know, you're talking and eating again, you know?
you gotta get that protein in there.
I was just wondering, if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I do.
cool, um, let me see...
we could check out "Love spelled backwards is love."
Yeah, it's a dumb title, but, um, it's a romantic comedy.
I mean, it's supposed to be. - No. No romance.
how about "Face Punch"? You heard of that?
well, it's an action movie. - Yeah, it's perfect.
with guns... adrenaline...
it's my thing - Okay.
we should get a bunch of people to go. Do you guys wanna go see...
"face Punch"? - "Face Punch"? Yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that?
remember the trailer's like... - Yeah?
punch his face in. - I don't remember that.
movie night with Bella!
so, "Face Punch," huh? You like action movies?
not really.
I heard it sucks. Bad.
Hey, are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without adult supervision? - Right, yeah.
well, she's buying my ticket for me. - She's buying it, okay.
Jessica bailed and Angela's got the stomach flu so Eric's taking care of her.
so, it's just us three. - Great.
great. - Yeah.
put the gun down.
put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your freaking head off.
both of you!
put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your freaking heads off.
alright, let's do this!
okay, I think I'm gonna throw up!
Jesus! - What a marshmallow!
you should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad. He probably has that flu that's...
going around.
what? I can't hold your hand? - No, of course, you can.
I just think it means something really different to you.
so...
okay, tell me something. You like me, right?
and you think, I'm sorta beautiful?
Jake, please... don't do this.
Why?
because you are about to ruin everything.
and I need you.
well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to...
but...
it's just because I don't want you to go anywhere.
it's... it's really selfish.
you know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
so I should be fair to you.
it's because of him, right?
look, I know what he did to you.
but, Bella, I would never, ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
you can count on me.
well...
I need to go home.
I'm... I was feeling sick before the movie, okay?
what is your problem? - Right now?
you are my problem.
feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
do you want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake... Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing?
Jake, you're really hot.
like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
that dude is weird.
Jake.
uh, your Dad says you have mono.
he won't let me visit but... would you call me?
Hey, uh, it's me again. I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theatre.
I just wanted to hear your voice. So, no pressure.
jacob, please call me.
okay, we should be back around three.
Hey!
look, I don't have to go fishing today. - Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about?
just be careful. - I always am.
those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
my kung foo is strong.
Jake!
you cut your hair?
and got a tattoo?
Bella...
I thought you were too sick to come outside.
or pick up the phone when I'd call.
go away. - What?
go away.
what happened to you? What's wrong?
Hey, what happened?
did Sam get to you? Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.
but if you want somebody to blame,
how about those filthy bloodsuckers, you love?
the Cullens.
I don't know what are you talking about.
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
you've been lying to everyone. Charlie...
but you can't lie to me.
not anymore, Bella. - Come on! Jacob!
look, Bella...
we can't be friends anymore.
Jake, I know that I have been...
...hurting you.
it's... it's killing me. It kills me.
if you, may be, give me like some time or something.
don't!
it's not you.
it's not you, it's me, right? Really?
it's true! It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be... a good kid.
not anymore.
it doesn't even matter, alright? This is over.
you can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
you promised me.
I know.
I promised that I won't hurt you, Bella.
and this is me keeping that promise.
go home.
and don't come back. Or you're gonna get hurt.
things are...
things are bad again.
without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
now it really feels like he never existed.
I will find a place where I can see him again.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but... the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
weren't you sort of a, um, ...a pet of theirs?
Yeah. You could say that.
do they Cullens visit often?
lie.
Yeah, absolutely, all the time. - Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
I probably shouldn't tell to Edward.
because he's pretty protective. - But he's far away, isn't he?
why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
she asked me to see if you were still...
...under the protection of the Cullens.
victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate...
...given he killed hers.
an eye for an eye.
threaten him. - Edward would know who did it!
and he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
after all, how much could you mean to him...
...if he left you here unprotected?
victoria won't be happy about me killing you.
but I can't help myself.
you're so mouthwatering. - Please, don't!
I mean, you'd helped us. - Shhhh!
don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.
victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, ...where as I'll make it quick. I promise.
you will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
dad, I saw them!
what's the matter? - In the woods. They are not bears!
what you mean in the woods?
Bella, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
they are wolves. I mean, they're like huge wolves!
are you sure about that, Bella? - Yeah, I just saw them.
they were after... something.
wolves? You saw?
alright. Well, Harry, ...feel like going hunting?
can you get some of your guys together?
sure, yeah. I'll... I'll just...
I know that those wolves will be dead.
and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
dad, you should... You should go.
you can just stay in the house?
Oh, you scared me.
what the hell are you doing? - Back up. I'm coming up.
look, look, I'm sorry.
for what? - I wish I could explain, ...but I literally... can't!
have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone?
one that wasn't yours to share.
well, that's what it's like for me.
or worse.
you have no idea, how tight I'm bounded.
I hate this.
I hate what they have done to you.
I mean, the killer part is you already know!
Bella, do you remember, when walked on the beach in La Push?
the sto...
the story... The story about the cold ones.
I guees, I understand why that's the only part you remember.
there must gotta be something you can do...
no. I'm in it for life.
may be we should just get out of here for a while.
we'll just leave. Just you and me.
you can do that?
I'll do it for you.
it's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
but I would run away with you.
if I could.
I gotta go. They'll certainly wonder where I am.
come here.
please... Try to remember.
it would be so much easier if you knew...
I tried, but... Jake.
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.
Edward, I'm scared.
you should be.
really it's just like an old story...
that we're not supposed to say anything about...
did you know, the Quileute are supposed to be descendants from wolves?
I need to see him.
he's not in.
I'm sorry, really need to see him. - Bella?
what did you do?
okay, what did you do? - Hey!
what did you do to him? - Easy!
he didn't want this! - But we do.
what did he do? What did he tell you? - Both of you calm...
nothing! He told me nothing, because he's scared of you!
too late, now. - Bella, get back.
Paul, calm down now.
run!
Jake, run!
take Bella back to Emily's place.
guess the wolf's out of the bag.
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?
fairy tales and horror stories?
is it possible that there isn't anything sane and normal at all?
Hey, I think, we should go back and see if Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul sink some teeth into him. Serves him right.
no way. Jake's a natural. You see him phase on the fly?
I gotta five that says, Paul doesn't touch him.
come on in, Bella. We won't bite.
speak for yourself.
Oh, hey, about Emily... Sam's fiance... Don't stare. It bugs Sam.
why would I stare?
you guys hungry? Like I have to ask...
who's this?
Bella Swan. Who else?
so, you're the vampire girl.
so, you're the wolf girl.
guess so.
well, I'm engaged to one.
save some for your brothers.
and the ladies first.
muffin? - Sure. Thanks.
leave it up to Jake to find a way around Sam's gag order.
he didn't say anything to me. - That's a wolf thing.
alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not.
Oh, and check it out! We can hear each other's thoughts.
will you just shut up? These are trade secrets.
damn it! This chick runs with vampires.
can't really run with vampires.
because they're fast.
yeah? Oh, we are faster.
freaked out yet?
you're not the first monsters I've met.
Jake's right. You're good with weird.
sorry.
so you're a werewolf?
Yeah, last time I checked.
a few lucky members of the tribe have the gene.
if a bloodsucker moves into town, then the fever sets in.
mono?
Yeah, I wish.
well, can't you find a way to stop?
I mean it's wrong.
it's not a life-style choice, Bella.
I was born this way, I can't help it.
you are such a hypocrite.
what, I'm not the right kind of monster for you?
it's not what you are. It's what you do.
they never hurt anybody.
you've killed people, Jake.
Bella, we're not killing anyone.
then, who is?
we're trying to protect you people from them.
the only thing we do kill.
Vampiers.
Jake, you can't... - Don't worry, ...we can't touch your little precious Cullens.
unless they violate the Treaty.
it's not what I'm saying.
you can't kill vampires, though.
they will kill you. - Really? We took out ...that leech with the dreads easy enough.
Laurent?
and his redhead girlfriend is next.
vic... Victoria is here? - Was.
we chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night.
but she keeps coming back.
we don't know what she's after. - I do.
me.
don't worry, we've got this place covered.
she won't get near you or Charlie.
but you gotta be careful.
she's fast, you don't know, how fast she is.
you know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting.
alright, I better go.
and you gotta go. - Yeah.
I got a vampire to kill.
Alice, I'm alright.
until I'm alone.
and lately, that's all the time.
jacob's gone, he's hunting for Victoria.
and Charlie is hunting Jacob.
and you're gone.
and so is Edward.
and I just have nothing now.
you got something, Harry?
Nope, nothing.
but I realize where I have to go,
what I have to do to see him again.
don't do this.
you wanted me to be human.
watch me.
please? For me?
you won't stay with me any other way.
Bella. Please.
breathe.
come on, Bella. Breathe.
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?
what the hell were you thinking, huh?
I just needed to see something.
take her home. I'm gonna go help over at Harry's place.
what happened at Harry's?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Charlie and my Dad are at Harry's place with his family.
is he okay? - He's gone.
come on, I'll give you something dry and drive you home.
hundred and eight degrees over here.
God! My hands are freezing.
it must be nice, never getting cold.
it's a wolf thing. - It's not.
it's a Jacob thing. You're just warm.
you're like, your own sun.
this is better. Now that you know about me.
but...?
you saw what happened to Emily.
Sam got angry, lost it for a split second...
...Em was standing too close.
he will never be able to take that back.
what if I get mad at you?
sometimes...
I feel like, I'm gonna disappear.
you know you don't need me, to tell you something like this.
but I always will. You're not gonna loose yourself.
I won't let that happen.
how?
I'll tell you all the time.
how special you are.
thank you... for everything.
wait!
there's a vampire. - How do you know?
I can smell it. I'm getting you outta here.
that's Carlisle's car! They're here.
Bella, it's a trick. Stop! You gotta come with me.
they won't hurt me.
if a Cullen is back here, this is their territory.
the treaty says we can only defend in our own lands.
I can't protect you here. - Okay, it's okay. You don't have to.
you're about to cross a line.
then don't draw one. Please?
Alice?! Oh my God!
Bella? - What are you...?
I'm sorry, I just... I can't believe you're here. Is...is.
would you like to explain to me how you're alive?
what? - I saw a vision of you.
you jumped off a cliff. Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself?
I mean, what about Charlie? What about...? - I didn't try to kill myself.
I was cliff jumping. Recreationally!
it was fun.
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy.
did you... did you tell him? - No.
he only calls once in a few months.
he said he wants to be alone.
Bella, what is that God awful wet dog smell?
that's probably me - Or... it's Jacob. - Jacob who?
jacob's kind of a werewolf.
Ugh! Bella! Werewolves are not good company to keep!
speak for yourself.
I had to see if you were safe.
I thought you couldn't protect me here.
guess, I don't care.
well, I'm not gonna hurt her.
no, you're just a harmless Cullen.
we're talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella - ...because of you. - Victoria?
Yeah, Victoria has been around.
I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled out of the water either.
I can't see past you and your pack of mutts!
don't get me upset. - Hey, stop!
things are gonna get very ugly! - Stop! Stop! Stop!
I will give you a minute.
you're going anywhere, you're gonna come back, right?
as soon as you put the dog out.
is he...?
are there others? How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
no. It's just Alice.
and she can stay as long as she like.
are the rest coming back?
no.
not that I know of.
anything else?
that's it.
well, if that's all, then you better go run back to Sam.
I have done it again.
I keep breaking my promise.
we don't have to do this to each other.
Yes, we do.
swan Residence.
he's not here right now. He's arranging a funeral.
who is that? What? - Always in the way.
who was that? - Bella, step back.
Jake, who was that? - Stop.
Bella, it's Edward. He thinks you are dead.
Rosalie told him, why I came here.
why didn't you let me speak to him?
he didn't ask for you. - I don't care!
Bella, he's going to the Volturi.
he wants to die too.
he left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore, remember?
but I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt.
what about your Dad? - I'm eighteen,
I'm legally free to go. And I left a note.
please, Bella. Just... stay here.
not for Charlie.
for me...
I have to go.
I'm begging you.
please.
goodbye, Jacob.
okay.
so you made up your minds?
I'm afraid your particular gifts...
...are too valuable to destroy.
but if you're unhappy with your lot, ...join us.
we would be delighted to utilize your skills.
won't you consider staying with us?
you know what will happen anyway.
not without cause.
such a waste.
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?
I figured, you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto.
not today.
what? What are you seeing? - They refused him.
so...? - He's gonna make a scene.
show himself to the humans. - No! When?
he's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at it's highest.
Alice, you gotta hurry up. - There's Volterra.
why are they all in red? - Saint Marcos Day festival.
they're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city.
it's the perfect setting.
the Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself - We have 5 minutes. - I know. Bella? Just breathe.
Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming.
if I go, he will read my thoughts, he'll think I'm lying and rush into it.
where do I go? - He'll be under the clock tower. Go!
No!
heaven.
you have to move!
open your eyes, look at me. I'm alive.
you have to move!
you're here. - Yeah.
you're alive!
Yes.
I needed to make you see me once.
you had to know that I was alive. You didn't have to feel guilty or anything.
I can let you go now.
never wanna go.
I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist.
but you said... - I lied.
I had to lie and you believe me so easily.
because it doesn't make sense for you to love me.
I'm nothing... human. Nothing.
Bella, you're everything to me.
everything.
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
aro wants to speak with you again.
no rules were broken. - Nonetheless, we should take this ...conversation to a more appropriate venue.
fine.
Bella, why don't you go enjoy the rest of the festival?
the girl comes with us. - No. You can go to hell.
come on, guys. It's a festival.
we wouldn't want to make a scene.
we wouldn't.
enough!
aro send me to see what's taking so long.
just do as she says.
go ahead.
are you scared?
are you?
no.
Hmmh.
buon pomeriggio!
is she human? - Yes.
does she know? - Yes.
then why would...
she wants to be...
and so she will be. - Or dessert!
sister, sent you out to get one and you bring back two.
and a half.
such a clever girl.
what a happy surprise!
Bella is alive after all.
isn't that wonderful?
I love a happy ending.
they are so rare.
la Tua Cantante
your blood appeals to you so much...
...it makes me thirsty.
how can you stand to be so close to her?
it's not without difficulty. - Yes, I can see that.
aro can read every thought I ever had with one touch.
and now you know everything.
so, get on with it.
you're quite a soul reader yourself, Edward.
though you can't read Bella's thoughts.
fascinating!
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
would you do me the honor?
interesting.
I see nothing.
I wonder if...
let's see if she is immune to all our powers.
shall we, Jane?
No! - Pain.
stop! Don't. Please stop!
stop! Stop hurting him! Please, please!
Jane?
master?
go ahead, my dear.
this may hurt just a little.
remarkable!
she confounds us all.
so, what we do with you now?
you already know what you're going to do, Aro.
she knows too much, she's a liability.
that's true.
please! No, no! Please! Please!
kill me... kill me. Not him.
how extraordinary.
you would give up your life for someone like us.
a vampire.
a soulless monster.
just get away from her!
you don't know a thing about his soul.
this is a sadness.
if only it be your intention to give her immortality.
wait!
Bella will be one of us.
I've seen it.
I'll change her myself.
mesmerizing!
to see, what you have seen. Before it is happened.
your gifts will make for an intriguing ...immortal.
go now. Make your preparations.
let us be done with this.
Heidi will arrive, any moment.
thank you for your visit. - We'll return the favor.
I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon.
we do not offer second chances.
goodbye, my young friends.
nice fishing, Heidi.
Yes, they do look rather juicy.
save some for me.
this way, please. Stay together.
stop! Stop!
you're here.
you can sleep.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Bella, the only reason I left ...was because I thought I was protecting you.
I needed you to have a chance... at a normal, happy life.
it was so easy for you to leave.
leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in a 100 years.
I swear...
I will never fail you again.
I'm so sorry.
Charlie's coming. - Hey!
you okay?
fine.
dad, you don't have to worry.
Yeah, last time you said that you took off.
I didn't see you for three days.
I'm really sorry, Dad.
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.
ever.
and you're grounded...
...for the rest of your life.
okay.
I'm not technically breaking any of his rules.
he did say, I couldn't take a step inside through the door.
I came in through the window.
he's not going to forgive me easily.
I know.
can you?
I hope you can because...
I honestly don't know how to live without you.
come here.
once Alice changes me, ...you can't get rid of me.
she won't need to change you.
there are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
no.
you all know what I want.
and I know, how much I'm asking for.
the only thing I can think of... for it to be fair is to just vote.
you don't know what you just... - Shut up!
I already consider you my sister.
Yes'! - Thank you.
I vote, 'yes'.
it would be nice to not wanna kill you all the time.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, both of you, for the way I've acted.
and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother.
but this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself.
and I wish that there had been someone to vote 'no' for me.
so... no.
I vote hell yeah!
we can pick a fight with these Volturi's some other way.
I already consider you, a part of the family.
yes'.
why are you doing this to me?
you know what this means. - You've chosen not to live without her, ...which leaves me no choice.
I won't lose my son.
I'll wait until after graduation...
...to make it easier on Charlie.
I want you to be the one to do it.
he wants to talk to me.
see, you're still alive for now.
he thinks, it's me keeping you away.
you stay the hell out of my head.
jacob, I know you have something to say to me.
but I wanna say something to you first. If that's alright?
thank you.
thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't.
no, you didn't.
and it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I'm still grateful.
but I'm here now.
and I'm not gonna leave her side till she orders me away.
we'll see.
Hey, my turn to talk.
I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty.
I haven't forgotten.
what key point?
if any of them bites a human, the truce is over.
but if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you.
no... No, I won't let you.
you're not gonna be one of them, Bella.
it's not up to you.
you know what we'll do to you.
I won't have choice. - Bella, please come.
wait.
is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.
I love you.
so, please...
don't make me choose.
because it'll be him.
it's always been him.
goodbye, Jacob. - No, you don't speak for her!
Bella, get out of here.
stop!
stop!
you can't hurt each other without hurting me.
he's right.
you shouldn't become what I am.
I can't do this alone.
then please just wait.
just give me... five years.
it's too long.
then, three?
you're so stubborn.
what are you waiting for?
I have one condition...
...if you want me to do it myself.
what's the condition?
and then, forever.
that's what I'm asking.
marry me, Bella.
you know, christmas is almost here.
here's your clothes, all packed. Just put them in the garage.
how long do you think we're gonna keep this up?
as long as the good Lord allows.
want me to get your bathroom stuff? I'll get it.
all right, guys. Let's go. Your dad's gonna be here in a minute.
you said you were outside. I just had a few more things to do.
that's not what you said. I need to turn off.
but it's okay.
let's hit the freeway before traffic gets bad.
let's go. All right. Yes, Malcolm.
all right, guys. Let's rock and roll.
tonight?
thank you.
t, let me get my drink, please, baby. You got it, Q.
Christmas in chicago is always slow, ain't it?
Oh, yeah, man, you know, everybody out shopping.
here you go.
come on, let's go!
Damn!
fool.
baby, what is that?
this a early christmas present from Joe. It's called a Nikon.
it's the Rolls-Royce of cameras.
Joe! Tell me you didn't get this boy that camera.
don't start. we talked about that.
it's christmas, baby. It's too expensive.
let it go.
let it go.
matter of fact, snap this.
here.
merry christmas. Now... Guess he told you.
boy, take this grocery list and go to the store.
before that lip gets you into trouble.
this everything? You sure? Yeah.
I wrote it down.
sometimes you forget stuff. I gotta come back.
you forget stuff and have to go back. Hurry up.
I have to change clothes.
get ready to cook.
Ma'Dere want me to go to the store. You want something?
no, I'm good.
I wanted to thank you too for the camera.
you know, I love it. when I was your age...
...I wanted a watch about as bad as you wanted that camera.
nobody could afford it.
you take some nice pictures with that thing.
come here, boy. oh, man.
you gonna do all this lovey-dove stuff.
I'm almost grown. Go on, get out of here.
she gonna start cooking any minute.
don't hurt nobody on that bike.
merry christmas, Lisa.
Oh, baby, please. You're gonna drive me crazy with that camera.
come on, where your christmas spirit at? come on.
ma, you told them 6: 00, right? They know.
they should be here. Stop. They been eating dinner at 6...
...ever since they could eat. They know.
look. Baby, get out with that.
you're making me nervous. Go.
come and taste some of this.
I want your stamp of approval. okay.
should have told them 4, then they'd be here on time.
it's frustrating being the only person in this family that understands a clock.
you know your brothers and sisters are always late.
that don't make it right.
why don't you come late, so that way you on time?
you know what? See, you- Mama, get her.
this is like hitting the lottery.
especially if we finance it ourselves. oh, yeah. Absolutely.
I'd be a millionaire before I'm 40.
I should be able to get a couple hundred thousand...
...while I'm in New York.
but you're gonna have to match that, at least.
I'm pretty sure I can get a chunk of it here.
well, that would be a happy holiday. Yes, it would.
now, that's a car right there. come on, Joe.
I'll call you when I get a chance.
nice. Hey.
nice.
got that new-car smell and everything.
damn, you got your name on the car? can't nobody steal it.
Hey, Joe, you need to get some of these for your funeral home.
Hey, how much this set you back?
my old man's got a dealership in San Francisco...
...so I got a deal, but they run for about 60.
it's a smart investment.
Kelli's got herself a new car too.
merry christmas.
guess she's smart like you, Malcolm. Hey, girl.
Joe, how you doing? Good.
good to see you. You too.
you look like your mama more and more every day.
get over here and hug me, girl.
and if you wasn't my cousin
Oh, yeah. You're all talk.
maybe, but when you gonna put me in a commercial?
Malcolm. Kelli.
let's get inside. Mama can't wait to see you.
get the rest of those bags. okay.
what you got in these bags, girl? Lots of goodies.
yeah? You bring anything for me? of course.
if I get any free time, I'm gonna call you later.
Lisa, you regifted me last year. I don't like that.
you know you wanted that frame, and that's
all right? You think I didn't notice. I noticed it.
all right, baby. Bye.
you could've bought me something.
did you see the frame, Rosie?
merry christmas, everybody. Hey, merry christmas.
damn, Baby, look at you, getting taller by the minute.
you guys better stop calling him Baby, because he's almost a grown man.
he's my youngest, no matter how tall or old he gets.
he'll always be my baby.
ain't that right. She's just a hater.
you just treat him special because he's your favourite.
my favourite is whoever I'm talking to at that second.
the one that needs Mother's love the most.
you should've called us. Malcolm would have picked you up.
maybe you'd have been on time. I got a car.
see our new Escalade outside?
you know, I rented a BMw convertible. Sexy.
Hey, can I try that? Like that's gonna happen.
can't blame a brother for trying.
so I guess that means things are going well on the job?
I can't complain. I just completed a perfume spot.
you need to let me come to New York so I can get my photography on.
what you need to do is get a college degree, just like your big sister.
so, Ma'Dere, is there anything else we need to do around here?
y'all want me to make something? No.
what? I can cook.
girl, you can't make reservations.
she orders up a mean chinese. Ten-hut.
merry christmas, claude!
Oh, my child. Hi, Mama.
you look so good in your uniform. You look like a formal peanut.
Claude's got all them girls going berserk.
they take one look at a fine specimen like myself...
...and can we say "Denzel'?
Yeah, when are you gonna settle down?
well, I know, whoever she is, just make sure she's taking care of you...
... and she can cook like your big sis.
some of us were busy...
...going to college while others chose to stay home and learn how to cook.
and those who stayed home helped with the cleaners...
...while the rest of us, who shall remain nameless...
...jetted off to college the first chance they got.
are you two listening to yourself?
a stranger wouldn't know you were sisters.
she started it. I don't care. I'm finishing it.
Kelli, fix some Kool-Aid for the kids.
are you sure you don't want me to make something?
no. Damn.
don't hurt yourself. Kool-Aid, simple.
play to your strengths.
stop it. claude, let the men know...
...We'll be eating as soon as Mel gets here.
I'm gonna get out of this uniform.
okay, so I just need- water, sugar. Help her out, please.
Where'd you get those pants?
I look good, huh?
gentlemen.
Ma'Dere said the food is ready. we'll eat when Mel gets here.
so, what's up with you, Malcolm?
nothing much, man.
good things. Good things.
except for the storm on its way.
who said it don't rain in california?
rains, fires, mudslides. I think God don't like california.
Hey, everybody. Merry christmas. Hey!
Oh, my God. Look at my- Hey!
Hey, Fred. How you doing? Hey. Now we can eat.
welcome home, Mel.
Ma'Dere didn't tell me you got leave. Hi.
I couldn't miss Mama's cooking.
I missed you. where's everybody? where's Lisa?
in the kitchen. Let me go say hi to her.
you go do that. Get in there.
you got a name, homes?
Devean.
Brooks.
well, you know, she did always like them articulate.
I'm about to go change. I'll show you your room.
come on, get your bags. It's okay.
y'all are punks, man.
devean Brooks. Brooks.
can we join hands?
bless, Lord, almighty God...
...the whitfield family and home. May health, purity...
...goodness, meekness, and every virtue, Father...
...reign on this christmas holiday.
may all who visit here...
...be blessed with faithfulness to thy law and thankfulness to God...
...the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
may this blessing remain on this family, Father...
...this home and all who dwell here, Father...
... through christ, our Lord. Amen.
okay. Dig in, everybody. Yes, sir.
pass that corn bread down here.
macaroni and cheese.
what? Don't put that on your plate. I got peas.
no, that's turkey.
everybody's good?
okay, okay, everybody.
let's do the family business first.
here are the shares of the profit from the cleaners.
okay? Each one of you has your own. There you are.
merry christmas. Thank you, Mama.
you know you didn't have to do that.
we didn't expect anything.
I do. Thank you, Mama. oh, you're welcome, baby.
can you warm this up? Sure.
it came out of the oven.
he likes his food hot.
I'll put it in the microwave.
that thing's going off like a drug dealer.
well, if you must know, it's my ladies.
it's christmastime, and they wanna spend time with a brother.
I know Baby better not be bringing any babies in here.
it's time for me to have that special conversation.
too late. Me and Joe already had it.
Yeah, I learned more than I needed to. Trust me.
I'm gonna take this in the other room. Excuse me.
thank you, baby.
you mind...?
thank you. oh, you're welcome.
when you're finished...
...pass the plate over here and I'll chew it for him too.
shut up, Kelli. So, Joe...
...what do you got planned for the holiday?
well, after breakfast, Baby's gonna take the family photo.
we're gonna go buy the tree.
then christmas morning we're going to church.
I didn't know your father was a minister.
no, he's not. He's a deacon. And he's not my father.
my bad.
Yeah, our father moved on.
I'm sorry to hear that.
no, he didn't die. He just moved on.
so, Devean...
...you and Mel go to the same school, huh?
she goes to Spelman. It's an all-girls school.
I knew that.
no, you didn't. Yes, I did. I knew that.
I go to Morehouse. So...
...how do you like attending an all-black college?
don't start with that nonsense. I went to Princeton
I went to Harvard. what's your point?
can you let the man speak for himself?
go on. I just wanna know what your experience is like...
... attending an all-black college. Ignore him.
I wanna answer. Morehouse has certain foundational principles...
...By which its existence stands.
it includes an appreciation for the ideas of justice, equality, democracy...
...humane treatment of all people...
...development of spiritual self and community.
sounds like you got it from the mission statement.
I did. But that's also why I go there.
not because it's all-black...
...but because it embodies beliefs and traditions I value.
the fact that all the students look just like me is a bonus.
I like that, young man. well said.
well, Mel, your boyfriend has a good head on his shoulders.
I hope some of his smarts rubs off on my little professional student.
stop, now. Mel's smart. She's just, you know, slow.
getting her four-year degree in what? Seven years.
I've changed my major a few times. Nothing wrong with that.
first a doctor, then a journalist. Now what?
pre-law. Pre-law.
Mel's major is always determined by whomever she's dating at the time.
Devean, what's your major?
pre-law. Damn.
come on.
that is wrong on so many different levels.
that was so good, Ma'Dere.
we have some sock-it-to-me cake. You want some?
as tempting as that sounds, Ma'Dere, I do have to make a couple more stops.
let me see you out. Hold up.
Bye, family. Bye.
Bye, Fred.
that boy, he need to slow down. He does.
I know. How many kids he have now?
six? Seven.
seven? Seven.
I'm gonna hurt him real bad when we find him.
not till we get that 25 G's he owes Luther.
or Luther will hurt you.
don't let your temper get you dead, man.
what happens if he can't cover the bet?
it's on Luther, man. I wouldn't wanna be Quentin whitfield, though.
we about to run a Boston on you. Believe that if you want to.
I think now is a good time for us to discuss the dry-cleaner situation.
we have a dry-cleaner situation?
Ma'Dere's been running the cleaners for 20 years.
what little money she makes goes to maintaining this house.
whatever's left over after that, she gives us in these yearly cheques...
...that amount to, what, lunch money?
you spending way too much money on lunch.
look, we each own a percentage of the cleaners.
I think it's a good idea if we sold it.
you trying to sell the cleaners?
she wanna sell her portion, let her. Hey, I'll buy it.
you can't sell a percentage. we have to sell all of it.
I guess you're shit out of luck...
...because we don't have to do anything.
well, we haven't been doing anything.
and I'm the one that's keeping the books.
how is Ma'Dere gonna maintain this place if we sell?
Mel, she doesn't need a place this big.
you trying to sell the house too?
well, especially since Baby is gonna be graduating soon.
I mean, he's gonna wanna move out eventually.
says who? I ain't going nowhere.
please. All these little girls chasing after you...
...you are gonna wanna get your own place.
all I know is everybody here but me came home for the holidays.
you sell this house and you ain't gonna have a home to come back to.
it's that simple. I mean, do what y'all want.
I got a date. I'm gonna holler at y'all.
well, despite what Baby says, he is gonna wanna move out eventually.
this place is just too big for Joe and Ma'Dere.
I mean, they can get a smaller place. Maybe a condo.
what makes you think Ma'Dere wants to live with Joe?
hello. He's been living with her since you left for school.
Joe's been living here? where have you been?
think you the only one getting her freak on?
okay, stop. My God. That is too much information.
I can't hear about Ma'Dere getting her freak on.
I don't wanna intrude in family business
then don't.
this was probably your idea, anyway.
you know, Kelli...
...I'm not gonna dignify that with a response.
you don't have to. You put her up to this.
Oh, come on. So you think...
...I'm not smart enough to come up with this?
no, you're weak-willed and easily influenced.
so you're saying my wife is stupid.
I think she said 'weak-willed'.
I said, you sometimes allow other people to think for you.
so now I can't think for myself? You know what?
why don't you concentrate on the paprika?
Kelli, I know exactly where I wanna put the paprika. Kelli.
everybody just bring it down a notch. It's not that deep.
the thing to do is just to put in a family vote.
well, we can't have a family vote without the whole family.
Quentin isn't here, so there.
dessert, anyone?
go ahead, now.
go, bougie. Go, bougie. Go, bougie.
that's my baby right there!
come on, Devean. Let's see what you got.
come on, Mama.
he's here.
Quentin! oh, my goodness.
Hey, Mama. oh, baby. You're home.
Oh, look at you. whitfield!
so I've been doing a lot of travelling, you know, touring. I went to Japan.
I recorded an album out there.
it's been four years.
you haven't changed a bit. You still look great.
don't blow his head up. Thank you, baby.
you look good too. Thank you.
you didn't bring no luggage, man?
no, no. I just, you know
I got another tour, so I sent my stuff ahead.
so you're not gonna be staying past christmas?
ma, I might make it back before New Year's.
I'm just not sure yet.
well, I guess I'll go up and finish your room.
I wasn't expecting you to be home.
Lisa, take care of him, now, till I get back.
Oh, my gosh. You have got to see Baby.
he's almost as tall as you. Get out of here.
he really is. He's not short like you?
Oh, be quiet.
you won't believe the stuff Joe has planned.
Joe? Yes.
we have a big breakfast in the morning.
and then the mens are gonna go get the christmas tree.
on christmas morning, we'll be going to church.
church? You know I don't do church. come on, man.
so, what's that mean, man?
you don't do church.
church ain't something you do.
it's a place you go to commune in God's house.
I don't believe in God.
not in the traditional sense. Not in the traditional sense?
I mean, I'm a spiritual person, you know.
I believe in a higher source. But...
but you don't believe in God. I don't believe in your God, Joe.
okay.
I'm gonna go let Ma'Dere know I'm leaving.
I'll see y'all. okay.
all right. You do that.
good night, Joe. Good night. Drive safe.
why you gotta be like that? whatever. whatever.
you do that, Joe. He ain't my daddy.
how he come in? we having a meeting.
come on, now. You know it's Joe. I don't care.
Quentin is the problem.
if Quentin says no, Ma'Dere's not going for it.
the guy doesn't even live here.
ever since Senior left, he's got this weird hold on Ma'Dere.
okay, well, Lisa, you're his sister, right?
talk some sense into the man.
I'm telling you, Malcolm. we've been through this over and over again.
I don't know what it is, but it's like...
I don't know.
same damn reason Joe and Ma'Dere put on these charades...
...like Joe doesn't live here.
Oh, come on. You telling me that Quentin doesn't know?
no. Quentin doesn't know. Trust me. He can't stand Joe.
he's been that way ever since he was a kid.
like he thinks one day Senior's gonna come back.
Hey. Hey, Lisa.
Lisa?
what?
never mind.
you said your dad moved on.
what does that mean?
a little after Baby was born...
...Senior decided to go off and, as Ma'Dere puts it...
...chase his dream of playing jazz.
he upped and left and moved to Europe.
she wouldn't let Quentin Jr. take up the saxophone.
she was afraid he'd leave too, but she couldn't stop him.
and did he? what?
up and leave her?
first time he's been home in four years.
a lot of phone calls and postcards, but he's a wanderer too.
senior's piano is in the garage.
she thinks that music is the root of the evil that's taken her men away.
hell, the rest of us are afraid to even hum.
look at that smile, girl.
I love to see you happy.
well, it's because you are such a good man, Joe Black.
you're a real good woman, Shirley Ann whitfield.
and beautiful too.
okay.
tomorrow morning? First thing.
I'm gonna pick up a few things.
I'm gonna take off, but I'll be back.
okay.
merry christmas, baby.
Malcolm.
Malcolm.
Malcolm.
Hey, baby.
I thought you had gone.
I was checking something for your mother.
Oh, yeah? what's that, Joe?
Christmas lights, brother.
we might pick some up when we're out tomorrow.
okay.
you know what? what?
I'm gonna tell you something as a courtesy to Ma'Dere.
now, I'm only here a few days.
you might wanna steer clear until I'm gone.
and I'm gonna say this as a courtesy to you.
I'm here because your mother wants me here.
if you got a problem with that, you take it up with her.
I'll do that.
if I was here, Senior...
...I'd look after your old piano, man.
Yes, I would.
Hey, Kelli, girl. what you doing?
just unpacking, Mama.
when you gonna settle down, child, like your sister?
where is this coming from?
I just love you. I want you to be happy.
well, I don't have a problem settling down, Mama.
I have a problem settling for...
...less.
I'm just focused on my career right now.
long as you remember your career is not gonna keep you warm at night.
all right. Night-night.
night.
need some batteries?
no, no. I'm not whispering.
no. No, everybody's cool.
did you eat?
okay, yeah, just meet me at the...
there's a club called the El Rey. It's off wilshire.
Yeah. Just take a cab there.
I'll meet you there in a little bit.
Yeah. okay.
bad girl? come here.
what are you doing? In your mother's house?
Yeah. You're gonna get tore down.
Hey. I thought you were asleep. No, I was in the garage.
I don't have my sax, so I thought I'd play Senior's piano.
that thing's still out there? Yeah.
it needs to get tuned, but it still works.
what you doing up? I can never sleep in a strange place.
this ain't a strange place. It's your home. Pass a napkin.
you hear that?
Hey, you know, Lisa wants to sell the dry cleaners.
Yeah. Really?
you agree with her? oh, I'm only hearing it now.
I don't have an opinion on it.
well, that's just like you. Nothing matters. whatever.
right. Nothing matters because this is the first time...
...anybody asking me my opinion about it.
well, you're never around long enough...
...for anybody to ask you anything.
do you hear that? what?
I don't hear anything. what are you talking about?
don't nobody sleep around here?
where you going? out.
Oh, no. Don't get stealthy on us. out where?
I just thought I'd, you know, go check up on the old traps.
Oh, cool. I'm coming with.
I'm good by myself, thanks. Hold up. I wanna go too.
Oh, we should ask everybody.
Yeah, it's not a group thing.
well, you know, Quentin, if Lisa's going, I'm out.

we ain't know that off-brand chick

we didn't know she was with you.
Oh, it's cool. I ain't mad at you, though.
like I said, it's cool. white girls ain't got junk in the trunk.
but I hear they got some strong knees.

come on, let's get out of here. come on.
so you pull out a gun on him because he pissed you off.
you lost your mind? we are whitfields.
we don't behave that way.
listen. You listen. what are you thinking?
I think you made your point.
I don't think I have. He pissed me off.
like you are now. Now, drop it.
all right. All right.
I'll drop it.
you always had that crazy temper, man.
you'd always just flip out. For what?
I mean, we're in a club. we got our sisters with us.
what happened in there tonight?
baby, please leave it alone. we have moved on from there.
you don't want claude to shoot you. we moved on, Q.
Yeah, all right. All right.
you got some explaining to do.
about what? 'About what?'
how come none of us knew you can sing?
because of him. Because of me?
before she hear you.
who?
what you think Ma'Dere'd say if she found out I wanna sing?
baby, come on. That doesn't mean.
baby, nothing. Y'all ain't have to hear it, live with it.
she's telling me how
I'm the last whitfield man who hasn't left her yet.
she's gonna find out.
but not until I'm ready to tell her, and certainly not now.
mama's real happy for this christmas, with everyone home.
and I don't wanna ruin it.
you have to promise that you're not gonna say nothing...
... until I figure a way to say it myself. Got you.
and, Mel, tell Kelli not to say anything in front of Ma'Dere.
I got you. Man, this is too much drama for me.
I say we all get some sleep, pick this up in the morning.
all right?
you know, Baby...
...you can sing, man.
good night.
come on, D. Let's go.
I was proud of you, man.
I'm going to bed.
I've never been more surprised in my life.
four years of 'maybe this year,'
so this time I didn't even ask him.
Oh, he just walked through that door, and my heart almost stopped.
I swear, Rosie, sometimes sometimes I thought I'd never see him again.
he's so much like Senior.
good morning, Kelli, girl.
good morning, Mama,' would be nice.
Yeah. Good morning, Mama.
let everybody know breakfast is ready.
he knows it's fine.
no.
no, I- we're not gonna bend on that, all right?
please. Give me a break. Listen.
it's a non-issue, all right?
I'll just fly out this afternoon...
...Take care of the paperwork, and then I'll fly back.
of course the money's there. Money's been there the whole time. In escrow.
look, I'll talk to you about it this afternoon, all right?
Yeah. Sure. All right.
can I help you?
Yeah, I just came to tell you breakfast was ready.
well, as soon as Lisa gets out the shower...
...We'll be right down.
going somewhere?
as a matter of fact, I am.
gotta fly back to San Francisco, sign some papers.
you know, business.
good for you.
one, two, three.
so you really pulled a gun on him?
yo. Don't tell Ma'Dere. You hear me?
man, I know. where'd you get the gun?
it's my service pistol.
you really was gonna shoot him?
hell, no. I was just trying to make a point.
you may think you're grown now...
...but Ma'Dere find out, she gonna bitch-slap you...
...into the middle of next week.
and you don't wanna miss christmas, do you?
man, go and pick a tree.
you guys decided yet?
let's take this one. That's a good one.
that there's an ugly-ass tree, Mr. Black.
I'm cool with it if Joe cool with it.
Yeah, I'm with it.
Yeah, we'll get this one. Right.
go on, take the photo. All right, let's take this picture.
come on. come on.
say 'trees'.
ready? Ready.
I don't know what Baby is doing, but he's killing the game.
isn't that, like, the third gift for him today?
the fifth. Put it over there with the rest of them.
Oh, that's me.
Oh, my God, it's him. who?
Gerald, from last night.
you spent the night with him...
... and you're not gonna answer? No.
no, you didn't spend the night, or no, you're not gonna answer?
don't get your bra all in a knot. we didn't sleep together.
you don't wanna waste a night of sleep with a man like that.
was he good? You gave him some?
it was a shared experience, but if you wanna get technical...
...he was the one doing most of the giving.
it is the season to give. I hope you used protection.
I'm not stupid. come on, where is it written...
...that a woman can't meet a guy, get some and then be done with him?
they have a word for women like that. Smart.
ho. what?
I'm just trying to school you. You don't wanna end up pregnant...
...and then next thing you know you got two kids.
did that just come out of my mouth?
Lisa, I'm ready.
what?
okay. Lisa, can we go?
I'll see you guys at dinner.
what's wrong with these two? Nothing.
it's fine. You got everything? Yeah. I'm all set.
Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Merry christmas.
merry christmas. Do you have any messages for room 302?
no, ma'am. No messages. okay. Thanks.
I can't believe Malcolm wants to sell the cleaners.
I know. You gonna talk to Ma'Dere about it?
no. we're gonna handle this amongst ourselves.
and I'm counting on you for your support.
I got you. Kelli?
yeah? Santa's here.
Santa? Santa?
and he asked for you.
merry christmas.
and what is your name, little girl? Tori.
Tori. Really? And what is your name, young man?
Keshon. Keshon.
did you write Santa a letter?
even Santa calls you that...
...when you sleep with him on the first night.
have you been eating some christmas cake or anything like that?
don't worry, I got something really good. Been good this year?
because I'm making a list and I'm checking it twice.
so he's a friend of yours? He went to school with Quentin.
well, you keep your eyes on those kids.
you have to be careful nowadays. You never know.
you be careful, okay? I mean, it's nice and all, what he doing, but...
Yeah. A Santa suit. Lord.
merry christmas.
see you, young man.
come on over here and talk to Santa, little girl.
okay.
so, pretty lady...
...what can Santa bring you for christmas?
well... How about peace on earth?
hell, peace in my family would do the trick.
let me see what I can do. come on and sit on Santa's lap.
and then what? Depends...
...whether you've been naughty or nice.
well, you're Santa. Aren't you supposed to know?
I know you were pretty naughty last night.
but Santa can't say it wasn't nice.
what are you doing here? All right, all right.
well, as you know, I'm a fireman.
we do this every year for the kids down at the mall.
since your mama's house was on the way...
...I figured I'd just come on by and spread some holiday cheer.
and being that it's christmas...
...I thought that Santa would bring you this.
Oh, I forgot that I left that there.
thank you, Santa.
now give Santa some sugar. My mother is in the next room.
she can give Santa some sugar too. where's she at?
okay, that's it. You gotta go. All right. well, listen.
you gotta agree to have drinks with me tonight.
okay. I will. All right? Nine o'clock.
I promise. Sounds good. I'm gonna hold you to that.
all right? out you go.
all right.
now, you be good, for goodness' sake.
Oh, my God. You slept with Santa.
I did not know he was Santa at the time...
...but technically, I guess I did.
I don't see why this couldn't wait until we got back.
baby, for the hundredth time...
...I'll be back in the morning.
but, Malcolm, it's christmas Eve.
bill collectors don't care.
the car we drive, the house we live in?
they don't pay for themselves.
you wouldn't understand that, being I'm the one that's doing all the work.
Oh, and I don't work?
I guess I just stay at home and sit on my behind...
... and raise your kids. I'm sorry.
but I'm just under so much pressure these days, Lisa.
I realise I'm not as sensitive as you need me to be, but we're partners.
okay? Now, I need you to get your family...
...to sell the dry-cleaning business...
...and then we'll have the capital to get our life to the next level.
do you really mean that? we're partners?
baby. Baby, come here.
now, you know we're soul mates.
all right?
everything I do, I do for you and the kids.
all right?
drive carefully. Here are the keys.
Oh, and make sure you put it in the carport, all right?
just in case it rains.
I'll call you!
yeah?
I love you?
back up, back up, back up. okay.
Claude!
come help us.
let a Marine get in here, show you how it's done.
turn it. we're going the wrong way.
Yeah, frontways is the best.
there you go, in the back.
Ma'Dere, we have the tree!
cocktail, anyone?
this one's from Bernice. Remember?
I thought Bernice was dead.
Oh, I'm telling her next time I see her.
Oh, my God,
Sam done put all 15 of his kids on the card.
Yes. His little boy grew up.
look, look, look. Nice.
Yeah, hey. oh, no.
we had the family photo........
...and pick ed up a christmas tree and decorated that.
and my cousin Fred came by.
Oh, okay. oh, honey, take these.
wait a minute, I'll be right back.
Oh, my goodness. check that out.
that's you?
there's a lot going on. Yeah, and...
Claude.
Claude, you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
what's wrong? oh, nothing.
that's not a nothing look.
Christmas card from Senior.
Oh, where is he now?
London. That's a good place for him.
Rosie.
you need to be honest with the kids.
tell them about the divorce and move on.
now is not the time, Rosie.
I haven't seen Quentin in four years.
I am not doing anything to upset him.
it's never a good time for you.
Rosie, where are the grapes?
in the freezer.
good, the kids love those frozen grapes.
get back in the fucking vehicle, Mike!
Mike, get back in the fucking vehicle.
let's go, Mike, now!
dad?
daddy?
I can hardly hear you.
I said your son has gone A WOL.
my son's in Iraq.
your son was in Iraq, sir. His unit arrived stateside four days ago.
soldier, if my son were back, I'd sure as hell know it.
he has until Sunday to get back or he'll be listed as absent.
I'm sorry, I have another call.
you have no messages.
Hey, this is Mike. Leave a message. If I ever get a signal, I'll call you back.
Mike, it's your old man. Heard you're back. Give me a call when you get a chance.
think about that. Freedom is on the march, and we're safer because of it.
iraq is still dangerous.
it is dangerous because that society is becoming more free...
... and heading toward democracy.
analysts say a broader strategy is at work...
... one that began with the offensive in the Sunni Triangle city of Samarra...
... earlier this month.
there you go.
you sure that thing's gonna fit?
you gotta trust somebody sometime, Hank.
anyone call? - Nope.
fort Rudd, how may I direct your call?
first Sergeant Arnold Bickman, Criminal Investigations Division.
I'm sorry, sir. I have no one by that name on base.
thank you.
anything you wanna tell me?
why can't I go with you?
if he's someplace celebrating...
...last thing he needs is his mother walking in on him.
I'll call you when I get there tomorrow. - It's a two-day drive.
for some people.
you don't wanna let it touch the ground.
okay.
where you from? - El Salvador.
do you know what it means when a flag flies upside down?
no. - It's an international distress signal.
no shit? - No shit.
it means we're in a lot of trouble, so come save our ass:
...because we don't have a prayer in hell of saving ourselves.
it says a lot. - Yes, it does.
you know how to do it now?
Oh, yes. - Good.
this whole concept of "Vote or Die!" To me the question is:
are they gonna vote?
are they gonna leave the bong long enough to actually vote?
I don't know.
dad?
daddy?
dad?
dad?
dad?
a strong low-pressure system will pass southward across New Mexico tonight...
... bringing with it colder temperatures and overcast skies.
go ahead, sergeant.
thank you, ma'am.
sergeant Deerfield?
Hi. - Thanks. I know you're busy.
I wish you told me you were coming. I could've made a little more time.
bet the base has changed a lot since your day.
Thanks, corporal. - Welcome.
what about his buddies?
we asked, of course.
the rest of my guys just got back from a 72.
I don't wanna seem like I'm not concerned.
where they been, it's a miracle more guys don't blow off for a few days.
would you mind if I had a look at his quarters?
no.
Penning. - Yes, sarge.
this is Specialist Deerfield's father. - Good to meet you.
have you heard from Mike? - No.
he wants to look at his son's quarters.
certainly, sir. Shortcut's through here.
me and Mike go back to Bosnia.
he's sure told me enough stories about you.
he hasn't called or anything? - Does that surprise you?
you know better than me, but I recall Mike showing up for roll call...
...with a collarbone sticking through his skin.
long, Ortiez. This is Doc's dad.
Oh, honored to meet you, sir. - Good to meet you.
doc?
a nickname we gave him. Made no sense.
that's Mike's room there.
you boys have any idea where Mike could be?
no, sir. - Sorry.
must be one hell of a woman. - Yeah.
good to meet you, sir.
when you hear from Mike, you tell him to get his butt back here, okay?
sergeant?
this is Specialist Deerfield's dad. We've come to look at his bunk.
Roger. I thought you were someone trying to steal shit.
is that your room?
Yeah. That's Mike's bunk there.
it was nice to meet you, sir.
who's that?
we lost a man.
that's your duffel, right?
Yep.
tried to convince him to take the one he was issued. It's like talking to a wall.
no photographs.
sorry?
Mike's always taking pictures and e-mailing them to me...
...and I don't see any photographs...
or a camera:
property theft is a real problem.
guess it was the same during your stint. - Yeah.
you mind if I take this? His mother gave it to him and I left mine at home.
I'd like to, but I can't let you remove anything.
I understand.
okay.
I think New Mexico is a very important state, and I want to win New Mexico.
I think New Mexico has great possibilities of better jobs...
... more jobs. You've got those wonderful...
this phone's been around some intense heat.
it's been in Iraq. - That could do it.
all right.
this is seriously fried.
let's see. Okay.
address book.
all right, there's numbers for barracks, burgers, chicken, Mom...
...pizza, TD's, Ted.
what's TD's?
that's a local joint. Could've been more, but that's all that's left.
okay, thanks. How much? - You want the media?
media?
Yeah. Look.
speed up!
no. This is trash.
Oh, yeah, here we go.
bonner, take this.
long, toss the ball!
historical moment.
the first time one of these kids is gonna get to touch a real American football.
that's your son? - That's Mike.
Yeah! No, you're going this way! This way!
Hey, that's my ball, you little fuckers!
Hey! Shit.
fuck.
what's wrong, man?
did Ali Baba take your football? - Turn off the fucking phone.
any more?
Yeah, but it looks like the rest of the files are corrupted.
if you want, I have a program at home that can pull them off.
it's slow, but I could charge you a hundred flat.
can you e-mail them to me? - Yeah, no problem.
Thanks. - Where's TD's?
I'm looking for my boy.
I'm looking for my son.
good luck.
I need four tequila shots! Four!
what are you doing?
just looking at some old photos Mike sent me.
you gonna be okay?
it doesn't make sense. He wouldn't leave without telling us.
I will find him.
okay.
night.
good night.
I can hardly hear you.
you gotta get me out of here.
well, she should've known better.
hold a sec.
your son is in the Army. - Yes, ma'am.
then you need to see the military police.
they're busy with the war. I'm trying to check things out.
you can file a missing person's report. - Fine.
in which case, you'll need to see the military police.
how about you let me talk to somebody that does more than answer a phone?
sir, I wondered if you could help me with this...
I don't think you understand. He loved that dog.
I'm sure he did, ma'am, but the dog bit him.
when a dog bites you, what do you do? - I really don't know.
you tie it up, you give it away, you might even shoot it.
you don't pick it up by the throat, wrestle it into the bathroom...
...and drown it in the tub.
that doesn't sound a little bit strange to you?
maybe he thought it was more humane.
more humane? It's a Doberman.
he's drowning it right in front of our son and it's biting him.
and I'm crying for him to stop. That all sounds humane to you?
your husband ever threaten you or your child?
he'd never hurt us. He just needs help.
that's why you need to go to the VA.
you need to go to them and ask them about counseling.
you think I haven't been down there?
he won't go. He's gonna hurt himself. I know he is.
look, I'd really like to help you here. - Really?
Oh, because it looks to me like you don't give a crap.
you know, in fact, I do.
but I gotta tell you, crimes against dogs are particularly hard to prosecute.
if you don't mind, I have somebody waiting for me.
okay. Fuck you, lady. - Okay.
great.
that kind of morning, huh?
you gotta take that to military police.
I'm trying to keep my son out of more trouble.
I know you're busy...
...but I need you to make one phone call to his bank and find out...
...if he's made withdrawals or used his credit card in the last week.
retired cop, or just watch a lot of TV?
military police, retired.
then you should know. Army has jurisdiction over its own personnel.
sorry, I hope you find your son.
I don't know what you think your job is, but if it's anything like mine was...
...It's to roll up drunks, twiddle your thumbs, not ask too many questions.
but my son has spent the last 18 months bringing democracy to a shithole...
...and serving his country.
he deserves better than this.
because we have done the hard work, we are entering a season of hope.
my God. Hank Deerfield. I'll be a son of a bitch.
what the hell you doing at home? - Well, you almost missed us.
we're taking the camper to see the grandkids.
I called you at the base. - Base?
well, Christ, Hank. I've been retired for 14 years.
you have not. - Yeah, going on 15.
how in the hell are you?
fine. Oh, want coffee or a piece of pie?
no, no, I don't have time. Helen's waiting in the camper.
What'd you do...
...bust an axle and call me for a tow?
no, I was hoping you were still at CID. I'm looking for a friendly face.
neither one of your boys in trouble, I hope. - No.
what was that oldest one's name, Darren? - David.
David, that's right. Joined 82nd Airborne, didn't he?
Yeah. - Yeah, tough bunch of sons of bitches.
how's he liking it?
he died in a helicopter crash on maneuvers at Fort Bragg 10 years ago.
Oh, God, I'm sorry to hear that, Hank.
very sorry.
how about the younger one?
Mike. - Yeah.
regular Army, just like his old man. In Iraq, doing well.
I'm doing a favor for a neighbor lady. One of her boys is in a little trouble.
is there anybody we know still there?
no, no. They're all gone.
she got you on a short leash.
well, you know.
kids are waiting for us.
I found his old checkbook.
is there anything written on it? I need a password.
no, there's nothing on it.
you sure?
which do you think it is, I'm blind or I don't feel like telling you?
I'm worried, Hank. I'm truly worried.
he's a good boy. He'll have a reason.
Hank?
I'll find him. Talk to you tomorrow.
what's going on?
don't you worry, it's not animal-related.
what?
they found body parts out on Mesa Luna Road.
I'll get the car. - Okay.
Hey, Bonner. There's your family.
stop fucking around.
you could've fucking broken it! - You're a fucking idiot.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit! What do I do?
do not stop. Do not fucking stop!
speed up! Speed up! - Bonner!
fuck. - What are you doing?
maybe go down there a little bit further.
aaron, I need more evidence markers.
you got all we have.
straighten out some wire hangers, and buy Dixie cups to stick on the ends of them.
come on.
and get me a receipt.
Sean?
Thanks.
tell me good news, Hodge.
well, it looks like the victim was killed by that fire site there...
...then the body was chopped up, it was burned...
...and animals scattered the parts, so...
and you're smiling like an idiot because...?
well, the base bought this field from the city two months ago.
city property only extends 50 feet from the center line of the road...
...so I don't think it's our body, chief.
well, hallelujah.
let's go home.
wrap it up, fellas!
boys with the shiny buttons are coming in.
it will necessarily break the back of the insurgency.
it is not, though, the panacea.
just by taking it out does not mean the rest of the insurgency will fall.
more than half of Fallujah's 250, 000 residents have already fled in anticipation of the offensive.
insurgents believed to number in the thousands have been preparing defenses...
... attacking U. S. Troops, and rigging booby traps.
Mr. Deerfield?
Jim Osher. Could I get a word?
Yeah, come on in. I'll just be a minute.
sir, I regret to inform you that a body was found last night.
upon investigation, we believe it to be the remains of your son, Michael Deerfield.
right. They'll need me to identify the body?
no, sir. We've...
they've determined identity in other ways. I believe partial fingerprints.
what do you mean "partial"? What happened to him?
I'm not at liberty to say, sir. Someone... - I wanna see his body now!
sergeant Deerfield, this isn't necessary.
it's not how you wanna remember your son.
maybe not...
...but it's the way he left this earth, so I don't see as I have any choice.
working backwards, carbon patterns show the body...
...was dismembered before it was burned.
it appears a large knife or tool was used, but the blade was dull...
...which is why the bones are shattered rather than severed.
burn patterns show us the dismembered parts were stacked...
...and doused with an accelerant in an attempt to incinerate the body.
you'd need an oven to approach an effective temperature...
...which means most tissue would've been left intact.
so the damage is largely the result of scavengers stripping the bones.
cause of death will take more time to determine...
...but there is evidence of stab wounds.
how many?
I'm sorry?
how many stab wounds? - Well, with much of the flesh missing...
...we can only count blows that made impact with bone.
how many of those were there?
forty-two.
one knife, or several?
one.
gonna turn these over to the Army? - Tried to.
said they took their own photos. And they didn't say it in a nice way.
I'd like to give you a call tomorrow before you go home.
I have a few questions.
ask them now.
your son didn't own a green car? - Mike doesn't own a car.
motorist reported seeing a green sedan parked on the shoulder near the field...
...that Saturday night.
one of the theories is that this is a carjacking or a robbery gone wrong...
...and there's a big uptick in gang activity lately.
I wanna see where he died.
I'm sorry. It's an active crime scene, but I will let you know as soon as you can. - Okay.
what else you wanna ask?
a lot of the deaths like these have been drug-related.
are you asking if Mike was a drug dealer or just an addict?
I don't wanna be asking anything.
you know the Army does regular drug tests.
not when they're in Iraq.
now, we found this under your son's mattress.
it's not gonna go in my report.
but why I ask is last month...
...we arrested three soldiers who were trying to smuggle heroin in from Kuwait.
they'd made arrangements to sell it to a local Mexican gang.
I understand Mike spoke a little Spanish?
and you think he could've been a drug mule because he spoke Spanish?
no...
...because somebody cut off his hands and his head.
I'm really sorry about your son.
show me.
I'm sorry?
I need to see where he died.
it's not our case.
the murder occurred on military property.
you know where it is? - There's nothing to see.
then there shouldn't be any problem with me seeing it.
you people sure as hell know how to trample a crime scene, I'll give you that.
I suppose you thought it was a good idea...
...to have everybody you ever met park on this shoulder.
if your boys knew what they were doing...
...they'd have found traces of blood in the gravel right here.
it's where he was killed.
so you don't see blood, but you know it's there?
Yeah.
just like I know his body was dragged from here...
...to there.
that's remarkable.
the ground is rock-hard, but you see drag marks.
you go to the trouble to burn a body, don't you think you'd cover your tracks?
I'm going to the restroom.
you might find it easier to drive around that field.
you couldn't do any more damage.
everybody knows everything.
Hi. - Hi.
can I help you? - I suppose the MPs have been in here...
...asking questions about what happened in that field.
they sure have. Terrible thing. - I'm checking it out for the family.
mind if I ask if you saw anything?
I wish we had. We would've liked to help.
we didn't know what it was when we smelled it, did we?
no. - How's that?
that Sunday, when we drove in the parking lot...
...we just thought somebody had been barbecuing.
smelled like burned meat.
thank you.
tell your MP friends they should be looking for a blue car, not a green one.
Why?
because a blue car under a yellow light looks green.
doesn't it?
it certainly does.
thank you.
it's the least I could do.
I'd say that's accurate.
I'll get a plane ticket.
no.
what do you mean, "No"?
I'll bring him home soon as I can.
I need to see him. I need to be with Michael.
he's gone.
I need to be with my boy.
there is nothing left.
what the hell does that mean?
Joanie, for once in your life, will you take my word for something?
for once? For once?
I seem to remember me being the one saying no...
...and you saying it'd be good for his character. Who won that argument, Hank?
Mike was the one who wanted to join. I sure as hell didn't encourage it.
living in this house, he never could've felt like a man if he hadn't gone.
both of my boys, Hank. You could've left me one.
Joanie?
Joan, please.
Joanie, I can't sit here and listen to you cry.
well, then don't.
door.
night.
night, sweetheart.
fuck!
another hallway left. Stacked, on me. Ortiez, cover this door to the right.
to the right. Penning, get this door with me. Long!
Roger! - Covering!
got it.
go, go.
clear. Clear. - Clear.
give me a status on that door! Better not fuck around with that phone!
absolutely not, Bonner!
see how the clothes aren't burnt?
it's really weird, Dad.
all right, all clear. Let's move it out! - Move it out.
sure.
Evie, chicken sandwich.
mustard or mayonnaise?
no, thank you, ma'am.
a woman stands topless in front of you...
..."ma'am" could be taken as an insult.
this your son? - Yes, ma'am.
I'm asking if anybody saw him. It would've been a week ago Saturday.
I'm sorry. I don't recognize anything but the uniform.
thank you, ma'am. Miss.
right here.
stay here.
excuse me, lieutenant?
I was just wondering how I came to be assigned this case.
which case?
jacob Ronald Millard...
...slaughterhouse employee, arrested for torturing chickens.
it's no big deal. Everybody does it.
everybody doesn't poke their eyes out, asshole.
sure, they do. - Shut up!
boss doesn't want me humping his daughter.
now we're shocked beyond words.
you see how you could draw information out of people?
people just like you, Emily.
that is how you got promoted from traffic to detective squad, am I right?
I'm sorry?
Oh, don't be.
if Wayne or Hodge could've fucked their way into the squad, they would've too.
well, Wayne would have.
one of us needs to know what we're doing.
you see, that's what concerns me. Having fucked my way into the job...
...I may not be qualified enough to piece together this complex of a crime.
I mean, take that murder site.
I would've never concluded that that soldier was killed on Army property.
I would've been fooled by the signs of struggle on the side of the road.
and you know that little trail of broken brush from there to where he was burned?
well, that would've made me think he was killed in our jurisdiction, and then moved.
because the killers didn't think it smart to chop him up under a bright streetlight.
Yeah. I would've totally misread that crime scene.
no, no, no. It's good work.
I mean, we needed another homicide.
what, we've solved three out of the last 10?
another unsolved would cement my standing with the mayor.
you have a problem with your fellow detectives?
you feel the need to show them up? - No, sir.
so it's the military police?
you think they're boobs, they'll bungle the investigation?
no, but let's not pretend we don't know the real motives for the Army wanting this case.
psychic powers. When did you discover you had these?
you don't believe their primary concern will be how this incident reflects on the Army?
this is a career move? Is that it?
I don't have a career, sir. I have a job.
I take care of my son and do what I'm told.
this boy died in a ditch beside one of our streets.
someone burned him like a cord of wood, leaving his remains for animals to chew on.
with respect, if that was your son just back from Iraq...
...I don't think you'd be as happy about tossing this case off...
...so you look better come election time.
that was with respect? - That was my intent, sir.
fine. I'll think about it and I'll let you know.
every second we lose in this...
didn't you say that you would do whatever you were told?
I sometimes exaggerate for effect.
how's David?
sorry?
your son.
he's fine, thanks for asking.
that deadbeat ex of yours ever show up for any of his games?
David's pretty pathetic at every sport he attempts...
...so he wants as few people to witness it as possible.
well, that's a damn shame, isn't it?
it's not like he's the boy's father.
anyway, way I see it...
...It's the oddballs and the misfits who go on to do interesting things with their lives.
how many former high school quarterbacks...
...do we roll into the drunk tank every Saturday night?
little misery in school is a good thing.
you know, I was first-string quarterback in my high school.
I seem to recall you showing me pictures of such, sir.
you're gonna keep after me about this Deerfield boy, aren't you?
I think you know what the right thing to do is, sir.
Jesus H. Christ.
Hilary. - Yes, sir?
get me Captain Fenderman at the base. - Yes, sir.
would you like to sit down, ma'am?
is that everything?
is that all of him?
Yes, ma'am.
you must have to keep that room cold. - Yes, ma'am.
that looks cold.
I wanna go inside. Can I go inside?
no, ma'am. I'm sorry.
my deepest sympathies, ma'am.
you don't have a child, do you?
do you?
Mr. Deerfield? - Hi.
I heard you ask if you could have Mike's Bible...
...and I thought it might bring you some comfort.
anybody know you took this?
no, sir. I asked the visitors' center where you were staying and they told me.
can I buy you a coffee?
I really should get back.
how about a drink?
to Mike.
I need to ask you something. And I want the truth.
was Mike doing drugs?
doc? I guess.
no more than the other guys. He wasn't like a heavy doper or anything.
you ever see him hanging out off the base with anyone?
maybe Mexicans?
no, sir.
how you adjusting?
being back?
hasn't been that long.
call your parents?
my mom. My dad and I aren't close.
did you guys talk much? - Sure.
we could've talked more.
did he ever say anything to you that I should know?
no, sir.
I mean...
...you see shit over there you don't wanna talk about...
...even with your buddies. - Yeah.
but he did all right, Mike?
he was a first-class soldier.
you know Mike. He loved the Army.
couldn't wait to get there, save the good guys and hurt the bad guys.
they shouldn't send heroes to places like Iraq.
everything there's fucked up.
before I went, I'd never say this, but you ask me now...
...they should just nuke it and watch it all turn back to dust.
Hank?
you okay?
Yeah, I was just about to call you.
a package came from Michael.
what kind of package?
I don't know, it's a package. He sent it to himself. It's from overseas.
I'm gonna open it.
no.
what do you mean, "No"?
does it look like it's been opened by customs or by the military?
how would I know? No, it doesn't.
why can't I open it?
just don't.
please.
just put it someplace safe.
okay.
night. - Good night.
morning. - Morning.
I wonder if I could ask you a few questions about your son.
I thought it wasn't your case. - It sort of fell back to me.
isn't that our good fortune?
I was wondering if you knew if your son had any enemies.
you mean other than the thousands of Iraqis and foreign fighters...
...trying to kill him till a couple of weeks ago?
Yeah, that shirt looks like it's still wet.
it's dry enough.
anything bothering him that you know about?
no.
you looking into the gang connection?
Why? You have reason to think your son was involved in gangs or drugs?
no.
when did you last speak to him? - Why?
capital One faxed me a recent summary of his credit-card charges.
after he got back, he bought tube socks...
I told him a dozen times, those are the worst socks.
they have no heel, they wear right through.
and then he went out for some chicken.
does it say what time?
and no more charges.
we assume your son was killed sometime Saturday night or Sunday morning.
we haven't found his wallet, but if it was stolen...
...we'd see a lot more charges on it, like computers, stereos, what have you.
have you been to the chicken place yet?
enjoy. - How can I help you?
we're inquiring about a soldier who was here a week ago.
you're kidding me, right? We're a block from the base.
can you tell what time he was here?
it's the last four digits.
1: 03 a. m. Sunday morning. We bill that as Saturday. Anything else?
can you tell us what he bought? - Not without the actual receipt.
okay. Thank you.
your four-piece dinner is $6. 79. Is that what most people order?
that or the three-piece.
so with tax...
...$21. 77 would be...
...three meals, three people.
four, if it's the three-piece, or one really hungry soldier.
there you are. I just dropped something off for you.
you did? - We took statements from Mike's squad.
thought you'd want them.
that's great. I was gonna call you to arrange interviews.
saved you the trouble.
how so?
sworn statements on your desk.
what, you didn't think I'd want to interview them myself?
just trying to give you a leg up.
Thanks. I sort of like to do my own detective work.
I'll tell you what.
read the statements.
if you still wanna question them, I will be glad to take the request to my C. O.
perhaps you misunderstood me.
it's not a request. I want the list of the men in his unit.
on your desk. - And I wanna interview them this afternoon.
you'll have to go to my C. O. With that one.
my chief already spoke to him. - This one's a bit of a jurisdictional mess.
there is no mess. The murder was committed in our jurisdiction.
that's where it gets murky. Read those.
I'd be glad to put the request in.
you don't have the sworn statements? - I have the statements...
then they're cooperating. I don't see the problem.
I have a right to interview potential witnesses.
has the Army said you can't? - They said they'd consider my request.
and that was 10 minutes ago.
and I'd like to talk to these men before they've been coached...
...or debriefed so any inconsistencies in their stories will have disappeared.
being a former military man, I'm sure you've seen that...
...perhaps when you served with Lieutenant Kirklander?
I'll tell you what.
skip upstairs and cry to your boyfriend.
because I'm just not in the mood to give a shit.
we're showing video that has just come in to CNN from Fallujah.
you ordered yet?
okay. Dig in, men.
may I? - Please.
okay. Out. - No, I can do it.
you can. Now get ready for bed. Go on.
is there anything I can do?
you're supposed to read it to me.
I don't understand one word of it.
well, do you know any stories?
I'm not much of a storyteller.
well, then read me the book.
you know where your name comes from?
my mother? - No, before that.
you're named after King David. Your mother didn't tell you that?
that figures.
all right.
there were two great armies assembled, the Israelites and the Philistines.
they were both up on hills, the Valley of Elah in between.
it's in Palestine, you know where it is?
no. - Doesn't matter.
anyway, the Philistines had a champion.
a huge giant...
...named Goliath.
Really? There's a robot named Goliath.
this is a different guy.
so every day, for 40 days...
...Goliath would stride down into the valley...
...and challenge somebody from the other side to fight, but nobody would.
all the bravest and strongest warriors that the king had were all too scared.
why didn't they just shoot him? - They didn't have guns.
they had arrows, but there are rules to combat.
you don't shoot somebody that's challenging you to fight with a sword.
so anyway...
...one day this kid, not much bigger than you, comes delivering bread.
he says to the king, "I'll fight Goliath."
Really? No way. - True story.
so the king dresses David in his own armor.
but it's much too big and heavy, so David takes it off and he looks around...
...and he finds five smooth stones about that big.
and he steps out into the valley, with his slingshot in his hand.
Goliath comes running...
...yelling this horrible scream.
and David lets fly with that slingshot.
hits him in the forehead, cracks his skull open...
...Goliath falls down, dead.
so he shot him.
with a rock. Not the same thing.
and you want to know how he beat him? - How?
the first thing David had to fight was his own fear.
he beat that, he beat Goliath.
because when Goliath came running, David planted his feet, took aim and waited.
you know how much courage that took?
just a few more steps and Goliath would've crushed him.
then he let fly with that rock.
that's how you fight monsters.
you lure them in close to you, you look them in the eye...
...you smack them down.
you fight a lot of monsters?
Yeah.
you win?
if I didn't, I'd have been crushed, right?
Yeah.
okay, then.
good night.
he likes to sleep with that door open.
he'll be okay.
door!
not that much. - Okay.
that's good.
you know that story isn't true.
of course it's true.
it's even in the Koran.
may I read the men's statements? - There is nothing in them that'll help.
the last time any of the men saw Mike was Saturday afternoon, before he left base.
you're a good father.
you don't have to prove you loved him.
I'm sure he knew.
dad?
daddy?
something happened, Dad.
it's the second day of what the U. S. Military...
... is now calling the "New Dawn" in Fallujah.
the operation is aimed at crushing the insurgents in their strongholds.
but how many insurgents are still there?
we'll go live to the front lines in a moment.
Hi.
Evie, from the bar.
"ma'am"?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
hello.
I saw the picture of your son in the paper.
when you came in, I thought he was just missing.
I'm sorry.
thank you.
may I?
nice eyes.
him I remember.
I work in another bar on the weekends. He was there.
must've been Saturday night.
what's the name of that bar?
Yeah, they were here. - Both of them?
Yeah, them and their buddies. - Saturday night?
we had to throw them out. That one was harassing one of the dancers, real asshole.
this guy? - Other one.
get a lot of assholes in here, but he was going for the prize.
shouting obscenities at the dancers. - You got the wrong man.
you ask me to ID a guy, and then you tell me that I'm wrong.
you two related?
what time they leave?
fuck if I know.
they weren't happy about it. Two of them got into it out in the parking lot.
thought I was gonna have to break it up myself.
thank you.
detective Nugent will stay while you write out your statement.
I want the pen back, Nugent.
word?
this is not Saigon. This is not 1967. You do not question witnesses.
I figured somebody should.
it must be frustrating being such a damn good investigator...
...surrounded by incompetent fools. Remind me, what is it you do in Munro?
I haul gravel.
that's a shame.
think of all the crime that could've been solved if you'd been on the job.
this goes to trial, the defense will say you poisoned the well.
it won't go to trial. - What?
it wasn't them. - I'm sorry?
I don't know why they lied about not being with him, but they didn't do it.
they were fighting in the parking lot. - Blowing off steam.
you have not been to war so you won't understand this.
you do not fight beside a man and then do that to him.
that's quite the world you live in.
find out why they lied.
there'll be a reason.
so you were there.
Yeah.
so why would you lie?
it's complicated.
why don't you just tell me what happened?
we were at this strip club.
just hanging out, having a good time. We were drinking, of course.
and Mike starts acting really weird.
really angry, throwing change at the stripper.
then he started talking trash...
...so she started talking trash, and they tossed us out.
and we're getting in the car...
...and Bonner's all pissed saying Mike can walk.
so Mike grabs him and they just start going off on each other.
but it's the kind of shit that happens all the time.
the whole macho-warrior crap.
nobody got hurt.
so we got in the car, we drove around for a while.
and then we stopped at the Chicken Shack, across from the base.
Mike bought, for getting us kicked out.
and what time was this? - I don't know.
around 1.
and then we came back here.
all of you?
no.
just the three of us.
why would you leave him there?
because we were wasted.
we had had enough, but Mike wanted to find some meth.
he wanted to buy drugs?
Yeah, like he needed to be more fucked up.
pardon my language, ma'am.
you think that's what happened?
he went looking for drugs, ran into the wrong people?
who knows? I mean, Mike always had secrets.
you know, over there, he was always sneaking off by himself.
he really didn't get along too well with people.
so you get kicked out of the strip club at 11, show up at the Chicken Shack at 1.
what were you doing for a whole two hours?
driving around, looking for a party, or women.
did you stop anywhere?
Yes, ma'am.
now you want me to guess?
we found a hooker over on Ten Mile Road.
she blew all four of us.
why didn't you say that when you were questioned?
we didn't think Mike wanted his parents to know.
you didn't want his father to know he got a blow job?
and was buying drugs. I wouldn't want somebody telling my parents.
so, what was the fight about?
Mike was in some dark mood. I don't know why.
and then he started saying nasty things to that stripper.
like what?
stuff I'm not gonna repeat. The woman's a stripper, not something on your shoe.
out in the parking lot, Penning said Mike came at you swinging.
might have, I don't recall.
what was different about that night? That you had a knife?
I don't need a knife, ma'am.
I guess back in Iraq things are different.
somebody makes you mad, you can deal with it, right?
you lost me. - It's a whole different world.
you got power. - You've never been in the Army.
but I know that you've got weapons and authority.
you put men facedown in the dirt, step on their backs, kick in doors.
somebody comes at you, you kill them.
you have to. The guy could have bombs, guns, you don't know.
kill him first. - You make the call.
react or die, isn't that what they say? Ever stab someone?
if I did, it wouldn't be your business. - There one day, back here another.
I gotta tell you, somebody comes charging at me, I'd reach for my weapon.
the interview is over. - I'm glad none of this bothered you.
I gotta tell you, I saw my father come back from war.
things he couldn't deal with pretty much destroyed him.
what was he, in Panama? - Enough.
you have no idea what we did, and we did it for you.
for me? - If I were you...
...I'd just say thanks, leave it at that, and kiss my ass.
walk away.
you happy now? You want to convene a war-crimes tribunal?
I want the clothes they wore.
I want to take full-body photographs for cuts and bruises.
ma'am, you can have all the undies you want.
but you might want to take a glance at this.
you still want them?
Yeah.
Hey, you better hang up, Saddam could be calling. "Mike, Mike, I give up.
leave him alone! - Fuck you, man.
leave him alone! - Fuck you, man.
you were right. They couldn't have done it.
they were with Mike at the Chicken Shack at 1.
bonner, Penning and Long arrived back at base 20 minutes later.
the field where we found Mike's remains is a half an hour away.
there's no way they could've driven there in time.
never mind...
so they left him there?
they said Mike wanted to buy drugs. - And that's why they lied?
and they had no idea where he went when they left him, or who he met?
no. And I have statements from every other man in the squad.
may I see those?
if they're telling the truth, no one saw him after dinnertime.
Yeah. Lab says no traces of blood on their clothes or their belongings.
did you look at these clothes?
I mean, look at this shirt.
it has crease marks where it came off the shelf.
clothes are cheap on the base.
first thing you do when you get back is toss every stitch you took with you.
there are nine soldiers in an infantry squad.
yeah? - They lost a man in Iraq.
there ought to be seven statements here and there's only six.
so one of them's on leave.
when I got here, the sergeant told me all of his men were back from liberty.
read the names.
Yeah. - Hi, this is Fred Gainley...
...at the Buxton sheriff's office. Are you missing a man?
because I have a Robert Ortiez here on a drunk and disorderly...
... says he's one of yours.
Thanks. I'll send someone over to get him. - I appreciate it, thank you.
he's AWOL.
check for priors and warrants.
and see if he owns a car.
bad boy.
he's a local boy.
first arrested Bobby Ortiez when he was 14, for drug trafficking.
got bail and the witness disappeared.
a year and a half ago we liked him for drug smuggling.
suddenly he gets all patriotic and joins up.
how did they let him in the Army?
no felony convictions.
they've lowered standards every month since this started.
there's a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu registered in his name.
what color?
blue.
that's not enough for a warrant. - He's AWOL.
the Army can go after him, we can't.
well, he's got four unpaid parking tickets.
try Judge Osorio.
any idea where our boy might be?
finding Bobby's never the problem.
go back to your motel. I'll call you.
police! Open up!
he's on the roof!
I got him!
take the street, not the alley. Take the street, jackass.
shit.
fucking wetbacks. It's always knives, isn't it?
you like cutting people up?
what the hell are you doing?
come here! Come on! Get off him.
Hey! I didn't do it!
don't you move.
don't you fucking move.
Jesus. - You okay?
fuck.
change him up.
all right.
good. We'll take him from here.
what was it, chico? You wanted him to carry drugs and he wouldn't do it?
is that it, chico?
afraid he was gonna tell on you?
wouldn't it be funny if the devil looked just like you?
come back here, you wetback prick. I'll show you what the devil looks like.
fuck you, man!
I see you cracked him wide open. - Put your hand up.
he isn't pressing any charges.
and you're damn lucky I feel pity on you, or I'd be doing it myself.
I didn't mean to hit you.
that's an apology in your world?
I'm sorry.
keep it. - Won't anybody question him?
I questioned him! They questioned him! We searched his house.
there's no evidence he had anything to do with it.
something's happened.
found him hanging in his room.
Jesus.
did he leave a note? - No.
my father gave it to me when I went to Vietnam. I gave it to Mike.
it was in Bonner's pants pocket.
he was carrying it?
he didn't leave a note. He put it in his pocket and hung himself?
I'm sorry.
but this is as close as we're gonna get to a confession.
confession.
Bonner's car. What color is it?
blue. Why?
you don't kill someone for no reason. That watch doesn't prove anything.
think your son would give him that?
it could've been planted. - Why did he kill himself?
I don't know. Tell me how he killed Mike.
he had an alibi, he was at the base. Why'd he kill him? When?
I don't know.
what? - Hey.
you remember...? You remember that woman with the dead dog?
we drained it.
Where's the boy?
he wasn't home, thank God. He was at his grandparents.
that's good.
that's good.
the remains will be shipped this afternoon. Check the address of the funeral home.
that's correct.
if I can be of any other help, just let me know.
sir?
you got any jumper cables?
Thanks.
I wanted to say how sorry I am for what happened to Mike.
and I wanted to apologize for lying about not seeing him that night.
I just thought that if I were Mike, I wouldn't want my parents to know.
you got a cigarette? - Yeah.
you think Bonner killed him?
no.
I don't know.
I don't understand any of this.
what would he have against my boy?
nothing.
I'm sorry.
Mike tell you much about Bosnia? - Some.
we seemed to always pull sentry duty together. Freezing our asses off.
he tried to convince me of crazy things.
try to get you to wear pantyhose?
did he tell you? - No, I told him.
cuts the cold like nothing else.
so he wasn't lying?
you don't want to get shot wearing a pair of those. You'll never live it down.
it's fucked up, isn't it?
Yeah.
let's get you to a good American hospital.
come on, speed this thing up!
it's okay. I'm gonna help you.
it's okay. Take it easy.
we're gonna take care of you, okay?
you okay? You all right?
now, where does it hurt? Right there?
easy. Right there?
we're gonna take care of you, okay?
good night.
tell me that's your son's signature on his credit-card receipt.
no, it is not.
we always assumed Mike was there.
that's Penning's signature.
three meals. Penning, Bonner and Long.
penning and Long. I want them now.
I can't give them to you. - Oh, yes, you can. And you will.
corporal Penning has come forward.
he's implicated Long and Bonner.
you son of a bitch.
you went to him with a fucking deal, didn't you?
he'll do serious time. - Yeah? How serious, huh?
how serious? How much time?
as much as I could get.
well, luckily for me, that means shit.
you see these? Those are warrants.
we have jurisdiction, you're compelled to deliver those men.
I want them now.
I am not the only one who made a deal.
my C. O. Talked to yours.
it is just one less headache for them.
it's out of our hands now.
I'm sorry.
I bet you are.
I wanna hear the confession.
long isn't speaking. I'll get you Penning's statement.
no, I wanna hear it from his lips, and I want him present.
that's not gonna happen.
how many soldiers leave this base every night...
...to go visit a bar, have a drink or two?
I know you're feeling burned. - I'm not burned, I'm fucking pissed off.
take a guess. On an average weekend, what, seven, eight thousand soldiers?
you know what? I'm gonna sit in my car outside any of your entrances...
...and pull over every vehicle that comes back to this base...
...and I will arrest every soldier whose blood alcohol is 1/1000 over the legal limit.
how many men would that be? - And how long till you're fired?
I'll do it on my own time, and we have a good union...
...so I'm gonna say four to five weeks.
how many DUI's do you think I could make in a month?
should we find out?
commander's office.
let me speak to Captain Henning, please. - One moment, sir.
we were leaving the strip club.
and we thought that Mike and Bonner have cooled down.
they could be like that, laughing one minute and fighting the next.
anyway, we're in the car, and Mike's all pissy...
...and Bonner just starts needling him.
just saying shit.
like what?
I don't know. Like what a good driver Mike is.
stuff that makes no sense.
but Bonner has enough, and he pulls over...
...and they just start going off on each other.
and Long was yelling for them to cut it out so we can go home.
and Mike starts cussing at him too...
...and then I look down, and I'm stabbing him.
you...? You are?
Yeah.
and your friends didn't try and stop you?
I think they were sort of stunned.
they're yelling.
and Mike falls to the ground, and he's dead.
and Long is screaming, "Christ, what do we do now?"
it was Bonner's idea to chop him up.
he used to work for a butcher.
he knew how to work the knife around the joints. Made it easier.
we would've buried the parts...
...but it was getting late and we hadn't eaten.
you were hungry?
starving.
we stopped at the Chicken Shack.
I liked Mike, we all did.
but I think on another night that would've been Mike with the knife and me in the field.
I think he was the smart one.
I think he could see.
I'm truly sorry, sir.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I saw a video Mike shot.
him in the back of a Humvee.
looked like he was torturing a prisoner or...
we arrested some haji who was wounded.
and we were riding along...
...and Mike was pretending like he was a medic.
and he would stick his hand in this guy's wound...
...and he says, "Does this hurt"?
and the haji screamed, "Yeah, yeah."
and then Mike would stick his hand in the exact same place...
...and say, "Does that hurt?"
it was pretty funny.
it became a thing with Mike.
that's how he got the name "Doc."
it was just a way to cope.
we all did stupid things.
excuse me, sir.
you know where Private Ortiez's room is?
you got a minute?
I need to apologize to you.
you got some real serious issues, man.
Yeah.
that's true.
I got a honorable discharge, if you could believe it.
it's the Army, I'll believe anything.
I hated it over there.
sleep in fucking tents. No toilets, no showers.
no toilet paper, gotta use your hand.
I couldn't wait to get out.
after two weeks here...
...all I wanna do is go back.
how fucked is that?
you know what that is?
Mike took it and e-mailed it to me.
why would he do that?
I don't know what anybody's told you.
there are standing orders.
you're in a convoy...
...someone or something gets in front of you, you do not stop.
you stop, shitheads pop up with RPG's and kill you all dead.
first week in Iraq...
...we're driving downrange.
six of us in the back.
you can't see squat back there.
doc hit something.
we hear it thump around underneath.
he stops.
gets out.
drives on.
not a word.
later, some guy said...
...we hit a kid.
I don't believe it.
you ask me...
...we hit a dog.
we killed a dog.
I don't know what that is.
no fucking idea.
Hey, Bonner, there's your family.
stop fucking around! - It's a fucking phone.
you could have broken it. - You're a fucking idiot.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit. - Do not stop! Do not fucking stop!
what do I do? - Speed up! Speed up!
what are you doing? - Dad?
get back in the fucking vehicle, Mike!
Mike, get back in the fucking vehicle!
daddy?
let's go, Mike, now!
are you there, Daddy?
I can hardly hear you.
you gotta get me out of here.
well, that's just nerves talking.
something happened, Dad.
for Christ's sake.
is anybody there with you?
no, I'm alone.
that's good.
okay, Daddy, I gotta go.
you be safe, son.
stay safe.
Yeah. You too.
you know, my son's been driving me crazy ever since you came over.
he wants a slingshot.
guess it could be worse. Could be a BB gun.
thank you.
so every day, Goliath would walk into the valley...
...to challenge someone, anyone.
but no one would fight him.
until David showed up...
...and said, "You know what? I'll do it. I'll fight him."
so the king dressed David up in his own armor, which was so big...
but why would he let him fight a giant?
he was just a boy.
I don't know, sweetheart.
do you think he was scared?
David?
Yeah.
I think he would have been really scared.
just like that? - Just like that.
it looks really old.
it's been well used.
and I shouldn't take it down at night?
no.
allen, Bomb Squad, Special Services...
state Police and the FBI!
lieutenant Jurgenson, you, Palmer! I want you to go to St. John's Emergency...
in case we got any walk-ins from the street.
take that down there and get it faxed. - Kramer, get the city engineer!
I gotta find out a damage report. It's very important.
Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want to blow up a department store?
did you ever see a woman miss a shoe sale?
Connie, I want you to get started on the witness sheet.
Ricky, you and Joe, you make sure the uniforms got it cordoned off there.
and you don't let the damn TV crews in. Benson!
inspector, phone. - Not now. Benson! Traffic!
we get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3: 00, or we got the traffic jam from hell!
Walter! - Yeah?
I think you'd better take this.
major Case Unit, Inspector Cobb.
said Simple Simon to the pie man going to the fair...
give me your pies...
or I'll cave your head in.
you see, Bonwit's was just to make sure I had your attention.
is there a detective named McClane there?
he's on suspension. - No, Walter, he's not. Not today.
who is this? - Call me Simon.
what do you want? - I want to play a game.
what kind of game? - Simon says.
Simon's going to tell Lt McClane what to do...
and Lt McClane is going to do it.
noncompliance will result in a penalty.
what penalty?
another big bang in a very public place.
what is it that you want Lt McClane to do?
which is in Harlem if I'm not mistaken.
kowalski! Lambert! Do you know where to find McClane?
well, I kinda doubt you're gonna find him in church.
well, you better find out what rock he's under...
and kick it over.
John. - Thanks.
gimme some more. Come on.
Jesus, John. You look like shit.
where did we leave off with that roster?
we got three killings in Red Hook the past two nights.
put Miner on it. And Genetti.
the mayor's office will call before the day's out.
next, 14 dump trucks stolen from a yard in Staten Island.
fourteen! Jesus! Is somebody starting a construction company?
Nah, it was John's landlady going to clean his apartment.
insurance fraud.
that's a priority out in California.
the contractor splits the money with the thieves.
we had that out in Jersey a couple years ago, Joe. Remember?
see what Kelly can do with it. - Oh, wow.
Hey, what was the lottery number last night?
you still bettin' your badge, Rick?
Yeah, 6991 every week.
6991 , lucky number.
half the cops in New York play their badges.
How're the kids, John?
I hear they're okay.
did you talk with Holly?
no, I didn't talk to Holly. - Coming up on it, Inspector.
is it hot in here, or am I just scared to death?
you wanna make sure the gun's secure?
Yeah, it's good.
you know, you're the first woman since Holly who's seen me do this.
I'm honoured. - Yeah, so was she.
so, where's the backup gonna be?
we're gonna drop back to 128th Street.
what?
ten blocks? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, man, that's just great! Hey, Walter, what is all this about, huh?
if we don't do it, this guy says he's gonna blow up another public place. - Well, why me?
what does it got to do with me? - I have no idea. He just said it had to be you.
it's nice to be needed.
frankly, John, you haven't been-- - Hey, Walter, how 'bout you mind your fucking business about Holly, huh?
between you and Simon, you're fucking up a perfectly good hangover.
okay.
we'll be back to pick you up in 15 minutes.
take your time. I expect to be dead in four.
let's go, Billy!
Oh, man.
Hey, yo, Uncle. - Come look at this.
it's ten after 9: 00. Why aren't you in school?
Tony wants to sell you this. - Tony? That no-neck dude they call "Bad T"?
he says he found it in a Dumpster.
he keeps stealing from people, they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.
no, he didn't steal it. He says his uncle gave it to him.
Mm-hmm. Hand me that newspaper over there.
don't ever let people use you.
you're runnin' all over town with stolen property.
if you get caught, you get in trouble...
while he gets to deny the whole thing and walk away.
you... you mean you want us to take it back to Tony?
no, I'll take it back to Tony, with a message.
now, where you goin'? - School.
Why? - To get educated?
Why? - So we can go to college.
and why is that important? - To get "respect."
"respect." And who's the bad guys?
guys who sell drugs. - Guys who have guns.
and who's the good guys? - We're the good guys.
who's gonna help you? - Nobody.
so who's gonna help you? - We're gonna help ourselves.
and who do we not want to help us? - White people.
that's right.
now, get on outta here. Go to school.
uncle, you better come look at this. - What?
there's a white man standing in the street.
I seen one. - Not like this.
dial 9-1 -1 . tell the police to get up here quick.
somebody's about to get killed. And get your butts to school. You hear me?
Yeah. - Yeah. - All right.
I paid 500 bucks... - You better back off, man.
Hey, man! - He ain't so big.
morning. - Good morning.
you having a nice day, sir? You feeling all right?
not to get too personal...
but a white man standin' in the middle of Harlem...
wearin' a sign that says "I hate niggers..."
has either got some serious personal issues...
or not all his dogs are barkin'.
Hey, I'm talkin' to you!
now, you got about ten seconds before those guys see you.
when they do, they will kill you. You understand?
you are about to have a very bad day.
tell me about it. Sir, this is a police matter.
for your own safety, I'm gonna ask you to step across the street. - You damn right it's a police matter!
for your own safety, I suggest you hide your butt in my shop till the police get here.
what the fuck?
Aw, shit.
listen, I'm a cop. I'm on a case. - What?
somebody blew up Bonwit Teller's an hour ago. Did you hear about that on the news?
Yeah. - The same asshole that did that said...
I gotta come to Harlem and do this or he's gonna blow up something else.
do you understand? - Shit, shit, shit.
listen, I got a gun. You should get across the street. - They got ten guns.
you should get across the street! - Look, start acting crazy, all right?
what? - Like Looney Tunes. You know, like Bellevue?
Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours? - He look like a friend of mine?
I think the dude just escaped from some hospital. You know, like Bellevue?
I am the voice of my own god.
and my god did...
I told the librarian that I had a bad headache, but she didn't believe me.
I really do have a bad headache, though. I have a very bad headache!
and my head does not feel-- - Oh, man, shut the fuck...
who in the fuck... - You've made a very bad mistake. - Kick his ass.
put it through his head. - Bust his head.
cut this shit off! Fellas! Fellas!
nature boy here hates niggers. Now, what are we gonna do about that?
fight him! - Yo, yo, yo, yo! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
Oh, shit! - Yeah!
get him! Get him!
back! Back up! - Hey, what you trippin' on?
back the fuck up! Now! - Hey, you better quit that, boy!
come on, man, get up. Get up! Get outta here!
stop the c-- Stop the goddam cab!
don't shoot! No, don't shoot me! Don't shoot! - Don't move that cab! Get up!
come on, get up! - Yo, you sayin' you gonna kill us?
I mean it! I don't want to, but I will! You know I will! Come on. Drive! Drive!
drive! Go! Go! Go! Drive, goddam it! - Oh! Get the fuck outta here!
drive! Drive! Don't stop! Don't stop!
just keep driving! Run the red light! Drive! - Don't shoot me, man! That's all I got!
that's all I got. - Man, put that fuckin' money away!
nobody's robbing you, asshole! - Don't kill me! - Nobody's gonna kill you!
shit! -Just run all the lights! Drive!
Oh, man! Damn! - We got a bus.
that cut deep? - How the hell would I know?
just keep pressure on it.
Oh, fuck!
Jesus, right? John McClane. I owe you one. - Damn right, you owe me!
you got any idea what those guys are doin' to my shop right now? - Chill out, Jesus!
we'll send a car for... - "Chill out"? What the fuck? Are you tryin' to relate to me?
talk like a white man! - Okay. Jesus, I'm sorry you got involved, all right?
why do you keep calling me Jesus? I look Puerto Rican to you?
guy back there called you Jesus, didn't he? - He didn't say Jesus!
he said, "Hey, Zeus." My name is Zeus. - Zeus?
Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo! Mount Olympus!
don't fuck with me, or I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass!
Zeus! You got a problem with that?
no, I don't have a problem with that. - Shit!
downtown. Police Plaza. - Oh-ho! That's just great.
get a record of all his collars, recent releases...
and a list of anybody else he might have looked at sideways.
it's probably as long as your arm, so I'm gonna need some help with it.
it's textbook megalomania. It's a pathological state...
in which fantasies of control or omnipotence predominate.
he wants control over him. He wants control over his actions, over his thoughts, even his emotions.
sounds like you got a secret admirer, John. -Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.
everybody knows you like pansies. - It's not that kind of emotion.
this guy is ugly. - How is that?
nothin' wrong with him a shower wouldn't cure.
beer is normally taken internally, John.
just get me some aspirins, will ya? - Yeah, okay. Hold this here.
this is Fred Schiller, John, and he's a ...
a shrink. Yeah, I got it. -Yes. I was saying that we're dealing...
with a megalomaniacal personality with possible paranoid schizophrenia.
Hey, hey, how about we just skip down to the part where you tell me what the fuck this has to do with me, huh?
I don't know. I mean, what I do know is it does have specifically to do with you.
this guy wants to pound on you till you crumble.
he wants you to dance to his tune and then ...
put on a dress and fuck me?
I was going to say kill you.
pick up five, goddam it! -He's sitting on an awful lot of rage...
and it could be manifested physically if he's stressed.
somebody he arrested? Somebody he pissed off?
that could be one hell of a long list. - Fuck you, Joe.
see, these people don't like to work anonymously.
they want you to know who's doing it to you.
so this name "Simon" is probably not an alias.
it's probably "Simon" or some variation.
Simon Robert E. Busted in '86, extortion, kidnapping, ten to fifteen.
did seven years for good behaviour. Released on a state work-furlough two months ago.
check it. - Thanks, Rick.
Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
he's a fuckup, not a psycho. The guy we're lookin' for is nuts.
a nut who knows a lot about bombs.
we found this in a playground. Professional!
very cool stuff. You know, boom!
you think you should slam it around like that, Charlie? - When it's unmixed, you can't hurt it.
this stuff is cutting edge. It's a binary liquid.
a what? - Like epoxy.
two liquids.
either one by itself...
you got nothin', but mix 'em
Ricky.
Charlie, you're gonna be wearing that shirt up!
christ Almighty, Charlie! - Like I said, very cool stuff.
now, with a package like this, you get a warning.
now, the bomb has to arm itself.
you'll see the red liquid pump into the clear before it detonates.
how long before? - Ten seconds, two minutes.
could be anything.
but once it's mixed, be somewhere else.
this stuff has gotta be pretty rare.
we oughta be able to find out if any of it's missin' somewhere.
I already did. Livermore Labs theft over the weekend.
he got enough to make another one, Joe?
about 2, 000 pounds. - Of that?
well, the detonating mechanism could be anything -- radio, electrical.
hell, you could use a beeper and phone it in.
inspector? Inspector, it's him. - He's got a double Alberti feedback loop on it.
a nasty little trick I believe once used in Lebanon. - Charlie, Charlie!
Charlie, shh! - What?
wanna start the trace?
Simon.
he wore the board, walked the street and survived.
where are my pigeons now? - Pigeons?
I had two pigeons, bright and gay, fly from me the other day.
why was it they did go? You cannot tell. You do not know.
you mean McClane? - No, I mean Santa Claus.
Yeah, I'm here. - Ah, there after all. And your friend?
Carver! Carver! Come on. We need you in the other room.
let's go! Come on! - They need you. Go.
Yeah, he's here, too. - And may I speak with him?
well, is the ebony Samaritan there now?
you got a problem with ebony? - No, no.
my only problem is that I went to some trouble preparing that game for McClane.
you interfered with a well-laid plan.
yeah? Well, you can stick your well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.
that was not smart. There are lives at stake here!
not enough time, Inspector. - You better hope he calls back.
he will.
Ricky, you wanna tell those people to shut the hell up out there!
Hey, keep it down here!
Simon, he wasn't speaking for all of us.
that was unpleasant. Don't let it happen again.
so, what's your name, boy? - Don't call me "boy."
I'm sorry. It was a poor attempt at humour.
I was going to send you home with a chiding...
but now I think perhaps you should join the game. - We got him!
it's a pay phone in Oslo.
no, w-wait, they say it's Juarez, Mexico. - Norway?
no, wait. No, wait. N-Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.
forget it! Australia? He's scrambling up their system. They don't know where he is.
having fun with the phone company, are we?
Simon says, McClane and the Samaritan...
will go to the subway station at 72nd and Broadway.
I will call you in 15 minutes on the pay phone outside the station.
no police. Failure to answer will constitute noncompliance.
do you understand me, John?
Oh, yes, I understand. I understand that you're a fuckin' wacko...
that likes to play kids games, that's what I understand.
hardly. - Hardly?
well, then, who are you? Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?
shoplifting? Purse snatching? Cross dressing? What?
you c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole your ch-chair with you in it.
my ch-ch-ch-chair with me in it? Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.
let me ask you a question, bonehead. Why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?
John, John, calm yourself. - Huh? Why don't you come on down here to Police Plaza...
and we'll figure this out like a couple of men, huh?
just come on down here. - If killing you was all I wanted...
Simon, this is Inspector Cobb. - you'd be dead by now.
I can appreciate your feelings for McClane...
but believe me, the jerk isn't worth it.
he's stepped on so many toes in this department...
by this time next month he's gonna be a security guard.
his own wife wants nothing to do with him...
and he's about two steps shy of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.
one step. One step.
now listen to me.
you sound like a real smart guy. What is it that you want?
are you talking about money?
well, whatever, whatever.
McClane is a toilet bug.
now what would it take just to forget him and live happily ever after?
you know, money is shit to me.
I would not give up McClane for all the gold in your Fort Knox.
72nd Street subway, pay phone, 15 minutes.
McClane and the Samaritan.
if you're competent in the least, you've found the briefcase...
so you know what I mean by penalty.
I wanna thank you for that vote of confidence, Walter.
well, I thought it was worth a try. This guy's a raving maniac.
well, he-he couldn't be any clearer if he got it from a case history.
he gave you clues to his identity.
he spoke German. He called it "your Fort Knox."
and he stammered when McClane pushed him.
now, you believe this guy really can't be bought?
there's no chance. The very mention of money only enraged him further.
what's that? - It's your shield.
you askin' me to be a cop again, Walter? - Ricky, get him his gun, all right?
you didn't answer my question. Hey! -Joe, this time they...
you didn't answer my question, Walter. - Are you done, Lieutenant?
now, you two better get going if you're going to get up to 72nd Street on time.
Joe, this time they go with backup. - You got it.
come on, you guys! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm not goin' anywhere.
Simon says you gotta go! - I'm not jumpin' through hoops for some psycho!
that's a white man with white problems. You deal with him.
call me when he crosses 110th Street. - Hey! Why'd you save my ass?
I didn't. I stopped a white cop from gettin' killed in Harlem.
one white cop gets killed today...
tomorrow we got a thousand white cops, all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers.
got it? - Get him back.
Charlie, where'd you find that bomb? - Chinatown.
shit.
Zeus! Yo, partner! Wait up!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I ain't your partner.
I ain't your neighbour, your brother or your friend. I'm your total stranger.
okay, stranger...
you know where that park is at 115th Street and St Nicholas?
Yeah, it's in Harlem. - Where do you think we found that bomb?
listen, this guy doesn't care about skin colour, even if you do.
what am I doin'? - Cheer up. Things could be worse.
I was workin' on a nice, fat suspension...
smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.
come on.
is that the phone?
okay, they made it to the phone, but there's a problem.
well, what do you mean? How big a problem?
Oh, about 300 pounds.
and they're probably going to end up having to get an operation. - Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
we need this phone for official police business. - Do you mind!
honey, I'm a cop. I need the phone right now. - I'm sorry, but I can no...
get off the damn phone, lady! Police business!
well, I never! - I can get used to this.
I'm sure you can find a phone across the street, ma'am.
let's get something straight. I'm the only one here on official police business.
don't ever do that shit again. - Let's get somethin' else straight.
you need me a lot more than I need you.
you don't like the way I do things, fine. I quit.
I don't know.
all right, I need you.
all right, I need you more than you need me.
Hello! - Birds of a feather flock together. So do pigs and swine.
rats and mice have their chance, as will I have mine.
nice. Rhymes.
why was the phone busy? Who were you calling? - The Psychic Hotline.
I'd advise you to take this more seriously.
look, it's a public phone! What do you want me to say?
you can simply say there was a fat woman on it, and it took you a minute to get her off!
now, John, there's a significant amount of explosive...
in the trash receptacle next to you.
try to run, and it goes up now.
nobody's gonna run, but I got a hundred people out here!
that's the point. Now, do I have your attention?
as I was going to St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.
every wife had seven sacks. Every sack had seven cats.
every cat had seven kittens. Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.
how many were going to St Ives? My phone number is 555
no, no, no! Wait! I didn't get all that! Say it again! - Not a chance.
my phone number is 555 and the answer. - But I didn't...
call me in 30 seconds or die.
all right, seven guys with seven wives makes... - Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.
seven guys with seven wives makes... - Shut the fuck up, McClane! He said seven wives with seven sacks.
seven times seven is 49. Now tell me the rest. - Seven wives?
uh, a sack with... s-seven sacks with seven... - Weren't you listening?
Yeah, I was listening. I didn't hear every fuckin' thing... - What the heck is wrong with you?
well, I... besides having a bad fuckin' hangover, for one thing! - All right, all right, all right.
seven wives times seven, 49. With seven cats.
seven times 49 is 343, right?
what, are you asking me or telling me? - I'm telling you. 343 times seven is
one, zero, 24. 2, 401 . that's what you got, right?
Yeah, that's what I got. Is that it, 2, 401 ?
that's it. Dial. 5 5 5-2401 . - 5 5 5-2401 .
no, wait, wait! It's a trick. It's a trick. - What? What? What do you mean?
I forgot about the man. - What man? Fuck the man! We got ten seconds left!
he said how many were going to St Ives, right?
the riddle begins: As I was going to St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.
the guy and his wives aren't goin' anywhere. - What are they doing?
sittin' in the fuckin' road waitin' on a mo-- How the hell should I know, McClane?
well, who's going to St Ives then? - The guy. Just the guy.
just one guy? Just one guy. - The answer's one.
how do you dial one? - 5 5 5-0001 .
zero, zero, one. Just one guy's going? - Hello, John.
Yeah, piece of cake. Give us somethin' harder next time.
but you're ten seconds late. - No, no! The answer is one!
boom. - There's a bomb in the trash! Get down! - Everybody, get down!
get down! There's a bomb! Everybody, get down!
there's a bomb!
get down! There's a bomb!
welcome to New York. - Really.
they were just talking. Here, you can have it. Come on.
come on, let's go. - I'm getting outta here right now.
I told you it wasn't a bomb. - I thought there was a bomb!
no bomb.
Yeah. - I didn't say ,Simon says.
it's 9: 50, John. The number 3 train is arriving now.
I left something provocative on that train, John.
half an hour. - or the number 3 train and its passengers vaporize.
use any means of travel other than civilian, I blow the train.
attempt to evacuate the subway, I blow the train.
I'll call you in 30 minutes. Be there.
we're fucked. - Ninety blocks in 30 minutes?
in New York traffic? It could be double that.
we don't even have a car!
Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir! I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
I am requisitioning this car for official police business. - Hey, what are you doing?
thank you very much. Get in! Get in! - What the fuck you doing to my car? - Pretty slick.
listen, I used to drive a cab. The fastest way south is...
what the fuck are you doing?
what were you sayin'? - I was saying I used to drive a cab.
ninth Avenue is the fastest way south. But we seem to be going east.
where the hell are you going, McClane? I told you Ninth Avenue was the quickest way south!
stop with that goddam yelling! I know what I'm doing! - Not even God knows what you're doing!
they're headed east on 72nd towards the park.
but Wall Street is south! - Man, stop yelling at me! I got a bad headache!
and the best way south is not Ninth Avenue, it's through the park.
Oh, dear.
I told you the park drive is always jammed.
I didn't say park drive.
I said through the park.
shit! We lost 'em. They're in the park headed south.
get outta here! - Fucking prick!
I got him, Connie. He's taking the scenic route.
outta the way! - Oh, man.
get out! Get outta there!
watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it! Oh, my God!
are you-- Are you aiming for these people?
no. Well, maybe that mime.
Whoa! Tree! Tree! Tree! Oh!
Whoa! - What's goin' on here?
look out! Whoa!
tree! Tree! -Just hang on.
rock! Rock! Rock!
Whoa!
Hey, look out down there!
McClane! McClane, watch it.
McClane!
come on! Outta the way!
how do Catholics do their thing? - North, south, west, east.
how much time? - Twenty-seven minutes.
ha! 72nd and Broadway to Central Park South in three minutes!
that's gotta be a fuckin' record.
come on, get out...
Yeah. Now what?
we need a fire truck. - What?
to follow.
9-1-1. - Lt John McClane, NYPD.
access number 7479. Calling from a civilian transmitter.
get me an emergency dispatcher right away. - Dispatch. Go ahead.
I got two officers down at the corner of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!
need an ambulance! Over!
emergency calls on the west side go to Roosevelt Hospital. That's two blocks from here.
slow the fuck down, McClane! - Kinda like football, isn't it?
what? - Get yourself a blocker and head for the end zone!
if you'd said Wall Street, we could've followed him all the way.
wrong! South of 14th Street's a different hospital!
Oh. - St Luke's. Hang on.
time? - 10: 02.
we're halfway there with 18 minutes to go.
fuck this! Hang on.
hang on. Get outta there! Slide over and take the wheel.
where you goin'? - We should be ahead of that train, right?
you're not gonna get on that train... - I'm gonna get on that train! You gotta get to that pay phone by 10: 20!
what are you gonna do? - I'm gonna get that bomb.
listen, you fail, I cover your ass. I fail, you cover my ass.
and if we both fail? - Then we're both fucked.
go now! Drive! Get to that phone booth by 10: 20! Go!
my lucky fuckin' day.
shit! Look out, ma'am!
look out! Look out! Look out! Get outta the way!
this is a bad idea!
Oh!
Whoa!
excuse me! Excuse me! - Hey!
just get outta the way, please!
112 Wall Street. - Wait. This isn't a taxi. You don't understand.
your light's on. I'll make it simple.
112 Wall Street, or I'll have your medallion suspended.
what, you don't like white people?
112 Wall Street? You got it.
come on.
fuck! Move your legs, sir.
get your legs outta the way! Sorry. Sorry.
Hey! Excuse me! - 1823405
Hey!

will you step outta here for a minute. - What?
I'm a cop. Step out of here for a minute, please. Will ya?
excuse me, please! Let me get through here, please!
it's him. - Excuse me. Excuse me, please. Pardon.
excuse me, sir, but I'm expecting a call. I need that phone.
why don't you use the other phone?
sir, please. I need to use that phone.
Hey, listen, bro, I was here first.
bro? Get away from the goddam phone!
put your hands up!
I have to answer that phone. -Just shut up and get 'em in the air!
watch it! Excuse me! Pardon me! Watch, watch your back! Watch it!
ladies and gentlemen, I'm a New York police officer.
I'm gonna ask you to calmly and quietly start moving towards the other end of the car.
go now, please! Go now!
fuck! Let's go! Watch it! Watch out!
watch-- Watch it! Go!
I have to answer that phone.
get 'em up!
look, if you have to shoot me...
then you go ahead and you shoot me!
but I have to answer this phone, all right?
I'm here. - And McClane?
he's on his way. Uh, you know, he's a little slow. He's kinda out of shape.
the rules applied to both of you. I'm afraid this is noncompliance.
goodbye.
trust me, guys. Duck.
Hey, get outta there! Get outta there! Duck, asshole!
Oh, my God!
McClane?
what?
you can see right down into the subway. -How many fire trucks do you count?
you guys! You guys! - How can you see it from up here?
Damn! Get in there.
officer, tell those people to get the hell back, will ya?
we got a shitload of cuts and bruises, a couple concussions...
some old guy's pacemaker stopped, and a pregnant girl's water broke.
and that's all. How're you doin', John?
still can't hear too good.
well, it's a miracle you're still alive. It's a goddam miracle.
Yeah, that's the problem, Joe. - What?
the miracle part. What are the odds of us makin' it down here on time?
zip. - That bomb was gonna go off no matter what.
he wanted it to go off right down here.
take this off me, Dave.
well, what's so special about this place?
I don't know. Something just doesn't add up. - Lt McClane?
huh? -They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.
where? -John?
John, this is Andy Cross with the FBI.
this is MrJarvis. He's, uh... - I'm, uh, with another agency.
it's good to meet you. - This is Lt McClane.
this is Mr Carver.
uh, we've got a couple of questions first.
do you recognize this guy?
no. - How about this one?
Mm-mm. - How about you?
did you recognize the voice on the phone?
no.
did you, uh, notice any cars following you?
no. - Anybody following you at all?
any kind of surveillance? Telephone? House?
anything unusual at all?
well, now that you mention it, I have experienced a...
you know, like a burning sensation between my toes.
I thought it was just some athlete's foot or something. I don't know.
we read your jacket, Lieutenant. We were told you would be cooperative.
cooperate with what? What do you mean cooperate? - Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.
we're wasting time here in this goddam van. - You wanna share information...
how about sending a little our way as well?
look, we wanna hear what he knows first. - What the hell?
you give us pictures, and then you... - Look, we want to hear what he knows first.
Hey, I know as much as you know. All right?
there's a guy out there settin' off bombs.
he calls himself Simon. He speaks with a German accent.
and, for some reason, he's very angry with me.
now, maybe you can tell me why, fellas. Huh?
the first man there is Methias Targo. Was Hungarian army.
explosives expert. Now we believe he's working for the Iranians.
working? - Freelance terrorism, by contract.
who's the girl? - Targo's other half.
rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb in between their sheets.
uh, he wasn't at home, but they think maybe they got her.
the second man was an obscure colonel in the East German army.
he ran an infiltration unit. The kind of thing the Nazis did at "the Battle of the Bulge."
english-speaking troops... - Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.
all we know of him is the G.D.R. medical records show he suffers from migraines.
his name is Peter Krieg.
well, that is an exceptional report, fellas.
now do you wanna tell me what the hell this has to do with me?
the name Gruber mean anything to you, Lieutenant?
it rings a bell, yeah. - LA.
what? - That thing in the building in LA.
Peter Krieg was born...
Simon Peter Gruber.
he's Hans Gruber's brother.
Oh, shit. - Yeah, it's that thing in LA.
we figure he's got you fitted up for a toe tag...
and he's gonna do anything to get it tied.
inspector! Inspector, it's him!
don't let him know we're here.
Simon. - Inspector.
now, who from the FBI is in the van, I wonder?
let's see. Almost certainly Cross.
come on, Andrew. Say hello. - Hello.
and I know you never run alone, so say hello, Bill.
still trying to butch up by chewing on your glasses, huh?
this, gentlemen, as they say, is where the plot thickens.
I have put 2, 400 pounds of explosive...
in one of the 1, 446 schools in greater New York.
it is fitted with a timer set to explode at exactly 3: 00 pm.
thank you. Your silence says I'm understood.
did you say 2, 400 pounds?
Yes, but please don't interrupt again.
Simon says, if you attempt to evacuate schools...
the bomb will be detonated by radio.
and, gentlemen, someone will be watching.
repeat, one school will be dismissed at 3: 00 pm, permanently.
unless-- - Unless what?
unless John McClane and his new best friend complete the tasks I set them.
John, are you listening?
Yeah.
the pay phone beyond Hope, Tomkins Square Park.
twenty minutes. Go by foot. No rush.
if you're really clever, you'll learn the location of the bomb and the code to disarm it.
Oh, and by the way, gentlemen...
we got something of a bargain on radio detonators.
the only problem is the darn things seem to respond...
to police and FBI frequencies.
so, if I were you, I'd keep off your radios.
Simon, wait.
twenty-four hundred pounds of that liquid stuff.
my God. Get me the commissioner.
he's doing a press conference. He's supposed to be here in half an hour.
all right, Ricky, get every senior officer on the site and get 'em here right away.
you're not gonna give me any jurisdictional nonsense on this?
I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.
what can I do to help you? - How many men have you got?
seventy-five. But if I push the panic button, I can get 500 from Washington.
when? - 2: 30, 3: 00.
between now and then...
we're gonna have to do this all by ourselves. Let's go.
and Tomkins Square Park is more than two miles away, so you guys better get running.
no radios. You take my telephone.
you get anything, you call me through the switchboard. Good luck.
Thanks. Find that bomb.
Ricky, where are they? - Right over here.
the senior man present is Chief Allen. - Chief of what?
transit. - Okay, thanks, Ricky.
gentlemen, we have a decision to make. Chief Allen.
the man who has done this has told us that he has planted...
another very large bomb in a school here in the New York area.
and he has told us that we cannot evacuate, but he has not said that we cannot search.
now, I recommend we get everybody, and I mean everybody.
I'm talking about police, transit, sanitation, fire...
even the goddam librarians.
and we start searching schools, and I mean right now.
I'm talking about a thousand buildings within the city limits...
and we have three hours and 15 minutes to do it in.
now, I'd like to keep the media out of this as long as possible...
because if they get in, we've got a panic.
are we in agreement?
come on, guys. Let's go!
move it out. Move it out. No radio contact. No radio contact.
they bought it. You can begin.
hook, line...
and sinker.
all right now, men. Let's go! Let's go!
let's go!
Hey, hold on. Let me go over there. - I gotta get through!
sergeant Turley! Sergeant Turley!
in the last five minutes, the volume of calls in here has tripled!
what the hell is goin' on? - Stop. Let me explain.
for the rest of the day, we're supposed to handle the department's communications.
what do you mean "handle"?
they're shutting down the police band. All calls will be coming through this switchboard.
and I'm gonna marry Donald Trump!
Walsh, what's going on? Why'd everybody tear out of here?
come on, Pamela. Look at your watch! It's comin' up on shift change.
the bean counters are worried about overtime...
so we sent everybody back to the precinct to punch out.
the next shift is gonna be here in a minute. - You are so full of shit, Walsh!
thank you.
what the hell?
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
detective, Bob Thompson, city engineer's office.
we'd like to get an idea of the damage.
man, you guys really got here fast.
well, it's Wall Street, sir.
a lot of money here.
a lot of opinion makers the mayor doesn't wanna piss off, you know?
is this it?
holy Toledo!
somebody had fun.
I'd appreciate it if you'd show my associates the way down.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Jimmy!
you got the flashlight? Murphy, come on, you too!
Rick Walsh. -John Gunther.
come on, gentlemen. Let's go!
you were probably at the World Trades. You know what that mess was.
please inform Mr Little that Mr Vanderfloog is here.
mr Vanderfloog?
there's a Mr Vanderfloog for Mr Little.
go down 20 metres! Come on!
a lot of steam down here. - Yeah, yeah. We snapped a couple of the steam pipes.
it's like a sauna. We got the subway guys to shut down the third rail.
it's on emergency lighting. - Yeah, emergency lights, and there's still some light... Hey!
no shooting! Speak English!
Otto doesn't speak English, do you, Otto?
where the hell did we get this guy? - He's one of Targo's thugs.
pull all the way up! Pull all the way! Pull all the way!
so what's up with this LA thing? You famous or somethin'?
Yeah, for about five minutes.
don't tell me. Rodney King, right? - Fuck you.
you know this guy Simon we're talking to? - Yeah.
I threw his little brother off the 3 2nd floor of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.
I guess he's a little pissed off about it.
wait a minute. You mean to tell me I'm in this shit...
cause some white cop threw some white asshole's brother off a roof?
mr Vanderfloog? Felix Little, corporate relations.
sorry you had to wait, but apparently there was an explosion in the subway.
it's played hell with our alarms, I'm afraid.
I trust there's nothing wrong. -Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.
now, you were concerned about a currency exchange?
w-we are not a commercial bank, in the normal sense.
apart from the depository, of course. - Of course.
Yeah. And you are in the flower business, Mr Vanderfloog?
back! Back! Come on!
come on!
Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog, that's the vault elevator.
I'm sorry. Our alarms are sonic and seismic...
two things which, I'm afraid, do not react well to explosions.
you know, th-this subway business has knocked all our systems into a cocked hat.
in fact, we've had to give up and pull the plug on the whole thing.
the repair people are downstairs now. - Good Lord!
Yes, yes. Heavens to Betsy! If anyone knew!
but I thought this was a currency exchange.
Oh, I think we'll go straight to the withdrawal.
Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here and take a look at this?
somethin's going on.
what do you think, guys? You'll be able to fix that?
just a minute now.
okay, I'll be right back. Down!
stay back!
stay back!
come on. Come on. Shit.
come on. - Front desk.
Yes. Call the police. Get your ass down here right now! I'm under attack!
Hey, just relax, mate. Maybe you'll live through this.
shit!
I think he's dead, my dear.
all right. Let's see to the office work.
$140 billion.
ten times what's in Kentucky.
fort Knox. Ha! It's for tourists.
Yeah. McClane.
John, you're out of shape? You barely made it.
Yeah, well, we all barely make it. What do you want us to do?
what has four legs and is always ready to travel?
huh? What? - What did he say?
what has four legs and is always ready to travel?
what's the matter with you? Don't you have kids? That's an elephant joke.
whoa.
that a bomb?
Yeah. Go, go ahead and grab it. - No. You're the cop.
man, Simon said you're supposed to be helpin' with this. - I'm helpin'.
well, when're you gonna start helpin'? - After you get the bomb.
careful. - I'm being careful.
don't open it. - What?
I gotta open it. Uh, it's gonna be all right.
shit! Shit! I told you not to open it!
I trust you see the message.
it has a proximity circuit, so, please, don't run.
Yeah, I got it. We're not gonna run. How do we turn this thing off?
on the fountain there should be two jugs. Do you see them?
a five-gallon and a three-gallon.
fill one of the jugs with exactly four gallons of water...
and place it on the scale and the timer will stop.
you must be precise. One ounce more or less will result in detonation.
if you're still alive in five minutes, we'll speak then.
wait! Wait a sec...
I don't get it. Do you get it? - No.
get the jugs.
obviously, we can't fill the three-gallon jug with four gallons of water, right?
obviously. - All right. I know. Here we go.
we fill the three-gallon jug exactly to the top, right? - Uh-huh.
okay. Now, we pour that three gallons into the five-gallon jug...
giving us exactly three gallons in the five-gallon jug, right?
right. Then what? - Okay. Now, take the three-gallon jug, fill that a third of the way up
no, no, no. He said be precise. Exactly four gallons. - Shit!
every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass off, and I'm out here playin' kids games in a park.
Hey!
you wanna focus on the problem at hand?
I thought you said you knew! You said don't say anything if you don't know!
I thought you said-- Gimme the fuckin' jug. We're startin' over.
No! We can't start over! We can't start over! - Pour that out! We're startin' over!
we can't start over. -Gimme the fuckin' jug, or I'm gonna put my foot up your ass, you dumb mother
say it! Say it! - What?
you were gonna call me a nigger, weren't you? - No, I wasn't!
Yes, you were. What were you gonna call me? - Asshole!
how's that, asshole?
you got some fuckin' problem with me 'cause I'm white, Zeus?
is that it? Huh? Have I oppressed you? Have I oppressed your people somehow?
I'll tell you what your problem is. You don't like me 'cause you're a racist!
what? - You're a racist. You don't like me 'cause I'm white.
I don't like you because you're gonna get me killed!
how much time? Aw, shit!
we got less than a minute. Throw this thing away.
no, we can't take it off of there. It'll detonate. Just, wait.
wait a second. Wait a second.
I got it! I got it! Exactly two gallons in here, right?
right. - Leaving exactly one gallon of empty space, right?
Yeah. - A full five gallons here, right?
right. - If you pour one gallon out of the five gallons into there we have exactly...
four gallons in there! - Yes! - Pour it in there! Come on!
come on!
don't spill. Don't spill it!
good, good, good! Exactly four gallons. -You did it, McClane.
put it on the thing! Get it down there! - Oh, shit.
Congratulations. You're still alive.
huh? - Congratulations.
Yeah, we did it. - You surprise me again, John.
this is becoming an ugly habit.
Yeah, well, I don't have the time right now, Simon. Listen.
did you have troubIe seaIing off the Rainbow Bridge?
Yes, weII, cIosing a bridge Iike that requires approvaI from many agencies.
and cIean up operations wiII take time as weII.

Toyocho, cIear the pIatform.
this is 1033. ATO isn't responding!
PTC-S1 maIfunction!
what?
go to manuaI and hit the brakes!
you gotta be kidding.
get back! Get back!
1033's coming!
they're gonna coIIide!
it moved.
what the heII is going on?
don't just sit there.
nab that "Spider" and fix the PTC-S1 .
caII the " Iine-drawer, " quickIy!
Roger.
excuse me. You must be Commander-in-chief, Kataoka.
who are you? Who Iet you in here?
captain Mashita, Metro PoIice, Negotiator Task Force.
I'm guessing it was just a run-of-the-miII bomb.
there's no such thing, you idiot!
we're on our way.
look, bombers Iike to stay and watch the fireworks.
someone there is sure to have seen a suspicious car.
gotcha.
are you sure he was in a car?
who, the perp? Yeah, and I'II bet...
he's got two more bombs ready to go off somewhere.
he's got wheeIs.
two more bombs? How do you know?
instincts, man! They never faiI me.
teII the CIC to dig up data on everyone, subway workers, raiIroad geeks...
subway contractors.
I can't reach Mashita.
what's that sIacker doing?
our new home.
start hooking us up.
a bomb?
Yes, a demonstration. BIew up a park trash can.
there's one on the subway?
we don't know yet.
keep quiet over there!
sorry. We'II be finished soon.
they're from the CIC, CentraI Information Center.
they feed me info.
a " Center " with onIy six peopIe?
smaII budget.
we can't possibIy check every Iine for bombs.
we'II wait for " him " to contact us.
in the meantime, couId you brief me on the situation here so far?
what does he want?
don't know.
then I don't need you.
my bosses are jumpy. They caII in the poIice for everything.
you guys just get in the way.
I'II fix this. Go find a corner and have some coffee.
I'm afraid that's...
what?
fine.
a corner, you say?
we'II be out of work soon, I bet.
let's do it, team!
bad news, Sir.
the system wiII take time to fix.
I had to caII in the experts.
they don't Iike us.
weII, we're intruders.
you take charge of CIC.
Kurahashi does wireIess.
the rest do data anaIysis.
run a search on " bombs " and " subways. "
WeIcome, foIks!
pieased to meet you. I'm Yano of pubIic reIations.
pIeasure.
Mashita-san, is it?
try not to smiIe in front of the commander.
why is that?
actuaIIy, he did make a joke.
he said you're Iike the " Spider. "
probabIy aIone and aIways on the Web.
a spider?
but we PR peopIe are cheerfuI.
so I Iaughed.
and you were reprimanded?
exactIy. But I can't heIp it. It's my job.
What're you waiting for? CaII him!
he's such a grumpy man.
but I'd be happy to assist you if I can.
then what was that train?
a prototype.
the free gauge " Spider E4-600. "
'free gauge? "
wait here. I have just the thing.
watch this.
it'II start up soon.
welcome to the Tokyo Transportation Railway.
nice graphics.
thank you. I was in charge of making this.
prototypes
what is a " free gauge " train?
the Tokyo subway was built to connect directly with private lines...
and continue running on their rails.
this meant that subway rail width, or " gauge " ...
had to match that of private lines.
ttr currently operates 8 subway lines.
two run on 1,435-mm gauge rails...
while the remaining six run on 1067- mm rails...
two different gauges.
the " free gauge " train " Spider E4-600 " was developed to overcome this disparity and run on both gauges.
lts on-board computer automatically...
adjusts the train's wheels to the appropriate gauge...
allowing it to run freely on all subway tracks.
lt is the future.
can't you cut its power?
the Spider can propeI itseIf using its onboard battery.
whoever stoIe it can run it aII he Iikes.
by remote, too.
the OS gIitch has shut down our " Automatic Train Operation. "
so the trains are now being driven manuaIIy.
hence the near coIIision at Toyocho Station.
why not stop aII trains manuaIIy?
weII, there are over 200 trains running on 8 Iines...
at 2-3 minute intervaIs.
where wouId we put them?
here, Iet me show you.
passenger voIume is above normaI on Christmas Eve.
so we have over 200 trains running on a tight chain.
if the stop-and-go timing is off for just one train...
it couId set off a chain of coIIisions, speIIing disaster!
you Iost me with the coffee and cream.
ReaIIy? It works for me.
ours is an independent system, to prevent hacking.
it's not Iinked to the Net.
maybe the cuIprit has access to this pIace.
don't Iook at me.
shimbashi Microsystems.
it's about time. This way, hurry!
I just ran a check on peopIe with ControI Center access.
no one suspicious.
try firms that worked on the OS.
how Iong can you run on manuaI?
about two hours, I'd say.
WireIess?
we're aII patched in, Boss.
Mashita!
what's wrong?
it's just a friend.
Mashita here.
learn anything yet?
not yet.
There'II be two more bombs. I guarantee it.
what makes you say " two " ?
what's wrong with everyone?
it's a hunch.
gotcha.
is everything okay?
Yes, don't mind him. He's reaIIy not a bad guy.
no room, Boss.
Oh... okay.
Akihabara, 4: 30 PM
toyo 1023, can you hear me?
the Spider's on your taiI. Stand by for orders.
how's it running without a driver?
I said open up aII " dumpers " !
conduct power checks!
Yes, now!
give me a visuaI!
this is Toyo 1023, coming into Kudanshita. l need orders!
1023, Kataoka here.
continue through and speed up.
what about passengers?
if you stop to unIoad them, you'II get rear-ended!
get me the west raiI yard.
we're going to start packing it with trains...
five trains deep.
Roger.
is Kudanshita Station cIosed yet?
I'm afraid not, Sir!
1023 and Spider going through!
hurry up and park that train!
ttr West Rail Yard, 4: 34 PM
we can't. We're full!
just do it! There're more coming!
lmpossible, Sir!
1023 and Spider just bIew through Iidabashi Station!
park the 1025 ahead of them in a dumper...
with the 1023 in tow.
what's a " dumper? "
a retention track.
for emergency sheIter and parking.
they onIy hoId two cars, though.
Shin-Tokyo RaiI wants to know what's up?
it's not their probIem.
evacuate... evacuate!
everybody, move to the next car!
the 1025 is in a dumper.
1023 here! lt's going to ram us!
caIm down. Did you evacuate the passengers?
just the last car!
the train's packed as it is!
controI Center... One moment, pIease.
is there a Chief Mashita here?
Yes, that's me.
HeIIo?
Mashita-san?
ls this Mashita-san?
he's made contact.
start the trace!
kurahashi, the cabIe!
how'd he get this number?
we're ready.
voice anaIysis underway!
Mashita-san, are you there?
I'm here. Is this " Dangan Liner? "
Yes.
how do you do?
hello.
skip the greetings. Two trains are about to coIIide!
that's not his intention.
we need to feeI him out first.
where are you?
he made contact.
why don't you guess?
I bet it's hard finding a parking space on Christmas Eve.
how do you know he's in a car?
very perceptive.
see, I toId you he'd be in a car!
watch it!
instincts, man!
cut it out!
watch the road!
do me a favor first, okay?
the Spider... it's about to coIIide with a train.
you know that, right?
couId you sIow it down a bit? Leave a IittIe space?
no, thanks.
just a bit... then we can taIk IeisureIy. AII right?
okay.
the Spider's sIowing!
dumper?
west RaiI Yard's got space.
canceI the dumper. Send the 1023 there!
Roger.
thank you.
so why are you doing this?
you should know, Mashita-san.
weII, I don't... Good-bye.
What're you doing? Find out what he wants!
I need to caII the shots. He'II caII back.
weII, if he sets off another bomb, it's on your head.
Where's the Spider?
weII, Sir... um...
come on, speak up!
something wrong?
the Spider has Ieft the Toyo Line. That's aII.
watch your step. Proceed with caution!
attention, units. This is the ClC with a suspect profile.
late twenties to mid-thirties.
gender unconfirmed.
expertise in explosives.
excessive demonstrative desire, seeks total control over events...
indicating a high probability that he's working alone.
the king of geeks, huh?
trace?
a stoIen ceII phone. PoIice report fiIed.
I'm checking the reIay point.
did you try him?
no answer.
work on cIeaning up that voice.
check surveiIIance camera video from Toyocho Station.
are you suggesting he did aII this by himseIf?
aII I know is he's chaIIenging me.
if I'm Iucky, I'II get him to reveaI something.
how's the ATO coming?
I'II go check.
and the " Iine-drawer? "
shouId be here any minute.
Line-drawer?
a speciaIist caIIed in to draw up new timetabIes.
a reaI character. Just wait and see.
what's the big fuss?
it's Christmas Eve, for chrissake!
come on, Mashita! Get on that perp's ass!
find out what he's driving.
and where he hid the next bomb.
l've located his signal.
he's in Akihabara, a miIe from the Showa Avenue reIay point.
head towards Akihabara, Kijima-san.
what am I, an idiot? I'm there aIready.
Oh, that's right. You work fast.
save the sweet taIk for the perp, aII right?
right.
SurIy peopIe everywhere.
no, you're just a priss.
got a minute?
weII, we struck out here.
he's a sIippery bugger, I'II give him that.
we can't get near the pIatform. Too many peopIe.
Kijima here. Did you check ex-subway empIoyees?
nothing.
contractors?
nothing so far.
give me something to go on here!
about 90 companies took part in developing the PTC-S1 operating system.
the work took 10 years, and started before TTS was privatized.
so how long are we talking here?
five, six hours at least.
we had to send for the older data.
six hours? Screw that! You have one hour, aII right?
let's move.
I'm freezing my nuts off!
are you e-maiIing headquarters?
no, I'm meeting someone.
a Christmas Eve date?
she gave me a ticket and toId me not to Iook at it untiI tonight.
I assume it's a movie but...
I'm supposed to meet her at 6: 30.
listen, a whiIe ago when the Spider Ieft the Toyo Line...
everybody grew siIent. Why was that?
uh, there are some things even a PR guy is not at Iiberty to say.
I'II invite you to the PoIice BaII.
not interested.
lots of poIice women... aII in uniform.
not my thing.
how about...
aII the N-gauge modeI trains you can carry?
HO-gauge with Iandscape?
I'm so sorry, Sir! I just got a IittIe carried away.
never mind. ReIax.
pIease don't fire me.
it won't happen again.
I promise to uphoId the raiIway worker's code of honor, integrity...
system's stiII down.
spider's moving again! Near Ikebukuro, Sakura Line!
spider confirmed!
inform aII nearby stations and trains!
may I have a word with you?
we're caIIing in the artiIIery.
the Spider's body is standard aIuminum aIIoy.
buIIets wiII penetrate it.
wiII that stop it?
if you hit one of the onboard computers, it wiII.
there couId be a bomb on board.
one of our guys swears there are more.
weII, your SAT is going in.
a team of snipers, apparentIy.
are you sure?
the assauIt's at Nagatacho.
but...
give me an area visuaI.
deIivery from the Metro PoIice Department. Who'II sign?
FIoppy discs?
zip cartridges?
even a Jaz drive?
don't they make backups?
I need a signature.
national Diet Building, 5: 30 PM

you reaIize SAT's in grave danger.
so are my passengers. In greater numbers.
Kijima, have you heard about the SAT pIan?
just did. What of it?
what if the train's rigged to bIow?
you'd better hurry to Nagatacho.
well, why didn't you say so?
whose ceII phone's ringing!?
I'm sorry.
it's him.
patch that in, and cIean the sound!
Kijima-san, it's him!
HeIIo?
Mashita-san?
Mashita-san? You there?
spider's arriving!
so who is he?
we don't know yet.
you caII yourseIves negotiators?
coming through!
spider's coming into Nagatacho!
I need to ask you something.
shoot.
it's carrying a bomb, isn't it? A second one.
bigger than before.
poIice!
MPD! Let me through!
he's with me!
coming through!
I bet it'd feeI good to bIow one up on the subway.
What're you saying? Have you Iost your mind?
caIm down and Iet him do his job.
hoId up, Kusakabe!
yo, Kusakabe!
commander!
Kusakabe, hoId up!
what?
it couId carry a bomb, you moron!
you'II be bIown to bits!
ever hear of " Juggernaut? "
juggernaut?
it's an oId Indian god or something, right?
no, the movie.
movie?
1974 British fiIm.
a man going by the name " Juggernaut " ...
pIants a bomb on a cruise ship.
a bomb?
starring?
30 seconds to arrivaI!
it stars Richard Harris and... Omar Sharif.
and the Scotland Yard detective?
Anthony Hopkins.
good. Directed by?
mashita, hurry!
richard Lester.
I haven't seen it but it's a bomb threat thriIIer, right?
correct.
you've got one on the Spider.
stand by!
Aim!
am I right?
good-bye.
I think it's rigged.
serious?
stand down.
stand down!
stand down!
the Nagatacho pIatform is curved!
Yeah, so?
at that speed, the train wiII...
strike the pIatform.
What?!
Kijima-san! Get out of there!
what?
retreat!
it's going to bIow!
son of a bitch!
damn Mashita. He's gonna get me kiIIed.
we Ieave without a fight.
this isn't over.
do you reaIIy know what you're doing?
ttr East Rail Yard, 5: 40 PM
an expIosion at the East RaiI Yard!
get me detaiIs!
casuaities?
unconfirmed.
the second one.
There'II be a third, an even bigger one, damn it.
Mashita!
Yes.
get him to tell you where the third one's coming.
what about CIC's data search?
60 companies to go... nothing yet.
weII, move it! I haven't got aII day!
deIivery from the Metro PoIice Department. Sign pIease!
haven't they ever heard of backing up data?
sign here, pIease.
they sent voiceprint records.
he used another stoIen ceII phone.
reiay point...
shiba Park.
Kijima-san... Shiba Park.
l heard you!
put him on speaker.
Mashita-san?
I hear him.
the East RaiI Yard, huh?
l didn't lie to you. l never said it was on board.
how's it feeI to hoId 2 miIIion peopIe hostage?
fabulous.
by the way... why?
l want to outsmart Japan's first negotiator.
is that aII?
you should be able to understand how this feels.
shouId I?
wiII there be a third bomb?
he's gone to aII this troubIe...
but demands no money. He just wants to beat you?
that's crazy.
what do you think?
I beIieve him.
so we're supposed to sit here whiIe you two pIay " match wits " ?
I intend to do aII I can to...
shut up! Our raiI yard's in ruins!
you heard what he said.
"you shouId understand how this feeIs. "
you're of the same stripe as he.
and we're hostage to your stupid IittIe game.
isn't that right?
I am not Iike him.
Where's the Spider?
shibuya Line.
not the Sakura Line?
it just switched.
it's on the Kudanshita Line now!
what?
you know, I often take the subway to Nihombashi...
when I go shopping.
but I aIways have to go up a Iong escaIator to switch trains.
so the Shibuya Line...
must Iie far beneath the Kudanshita Line raiIs.
what's your point?
the Spider can't possibIy switch to the Kudanshita Line...
from the Shibuya Line.
even with its free gauge, there's no connecting raiI.
unIess there are tracks not shown on the map...
unofficiaI " side Iines " .
when the Spider Ieft the Toyo Iine earIier, and when it switched to the Shibuya Line, it used these so caIIed " side Iines " .
Hey, PR man.
no such Iines exist.
then how'd the Spider change Iines?
ask the Spider.
tokyo's underground is rumored to have many pre-war tunneIs.
I've read those books...
urban Iegends.
spider passing Otemachi!
unofficiaI raiI Iines exist, don't they?
connecting to key subway stations.
the Spider's using them.
they're for government evacuations or miIitary use.
so they're a secret.
is that right?
apparentIy so.
you're misguided. Just what are you pIotting, anyway?
just to soIve this case.
and yes, I have an idea.
what's a cop know of subways?
spider?
near Jimbocho.
no wait... It's gone.
sensors don't respond.
I'II put it on screen.
it's not running on " side Iines. " We're tracking it.
image anaIysis compIete.
it's of a signaI receiver.
shiba Park, 5: 50 PM
car inspections?
underway.
Kijima-san!
that car there?
want him questioned?
what? A guy hoIding 2 miIIion peopIe hostage driving that?
give me a break.
it's the busiest time of year for deIivery trucks!
you Iistening?
Hey, CIC! Give me something!
we're doing our best!
okay... good. The drinks wiII be on me.
Roger that.
you want drink with him?
I do.
the unofficiaI Iines.
thank you.
you say your cop friend's reaIIy not a bad guy.
our commander's the same.

no casualties reported.
meanwhile, subway officials are receiving thousands of complaints...
about train delays and trains not making scheduled stops.
in order for me to carry out the foIIowing pIan...
I'II need your heIp.
this isn't a game.
it's not about him and me.
what is it then?
it's a war being waged on your subway.
rest assured I wiII not share my knowIedge of the hidden Iines.
you bet you won't.
thank you.
just save the negotiating for " him. "
what's your pIan?
we find the Spider.
how? Those tracks don't have sensors.
we send poIice and SAT into those Iines on foot...
to shoot it down.
we'II need station staff guidance.
and the bomb?
there isn't one on board.
why'd you caII off the first assauIt, then?
aII right. We'II do it your way.
Kumazawa-san, continue your work restoring order to the timetabIe.

Hello? Mashita-san...
Mashita-san?
I'm here.
you know " The Odessa File " ?
another movie.
1974, British-German fiIm.
spy thriIIer about a Neo-Nazi pIot.
starring Jon Voight.
this story is about Howard Beale, the "Network News" anchorman on UBS TV.
in his time, Howard Beale had been a mandarin of television...
the grand old man of news...
with a HUT rating of 16 and a 28 audience share.
in 1969, however, his fortunes began to decline.
he fell to a 22 share.
the following year, his wife died, and he was left a childless widower...
with an 8 rating and a 12 share.
he became morose and isolated, began to drink heavily.
on September 22, 1975, he was fired...
effective in two weeks.
the news was broken to him by Max Schumacher who was the president of the News Division at UBS.
the two old friends got properly pissed.
I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in 1951.
must've been 1950.
I was at NBC. Associate producer.
morning news. I was just a kid-- 26 years old.
anyway, they were building the lower level of the George Washington Bridge.
we were doing a remote from there.
and nobody told me.
7: 00 a. m. I get a call.
where are you? You're supposed to be on the George Washington Bridge?
I jump out of bed, throw my raincoat over my pajamas.
I run downstairs and out into the street...
hail a cab and say to the cabbie...
take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge.
the cabbie turns around and says
he says, "Don't do it, buddy. You're a young man.You've got your whole life ahead of you."
didn't I tell you that before?
I'm gonna kill myself.
shit, Howard.
I'm gonna blow my brains out right on the air...
right in the middle of the seven o'clock news.
you'll get a hell of a rating, I'll guarantee that.
fifty share easy.
you think so? - Sure.
we could make a series out of it. "Suicide of the Week."
why limit ourselves? "Execution of the Week."
terrorist of the Week.
they'll love it.
suicides. Assassinations.
mad bombers.
Mafia hit men.
automobile smashups.
the Death Hour.
a great Sunday night show for the whole family.
it'd put fucking Disney right off the air.
let's do the Lenin deportation at the end of three.
strong enough to bump? - At one, then.
I'll do a lead on Sarah Jane Moore to May Berry in San Francisco.
the film I saw was of the chief of detectives.
I think we've got ten seconds on the shooting itself.
the whole thing is 1: 25.
what does that come out? - About 4: 50.
can we use Squeaky Fromme? - Let's do that at two.
squeaky boarded the airport bus.
you using a map on him for San Francisco?
I'd prefer newspapers.
what've we got left?
gun control. Patty Hearst affidavit.
guerillas in Chad. OPEC in Guiana.
Hello, Howard. How are you?
don't forget, Howard, we're not using the 16.
the first attempt on President Ford's life was 18 days ago...

the American people are good people.
democrats, lndependents, Republicans and others.
how do you get mixed up that type? - I don't know.
if you're so hot, why go to strangers? What's wrong with me?
ready two.
two. Cue Howard.
ladies and gentlemen, I would like at this moment...
to announce that I will be retiring from this program in two weeks' time...
because of poor ratings.
since this show is the only thing I had going for me in my life...
I have decided to kill myself.
I'm going to blow my brains out on this program a week from today.
ten seconds to commercial.
tune in next Tuesday.
that should give the public relations people a week to promote the show.
we oughta get a hell of a rating out of that.
fifty share easy.
listen. Did you hear that? - What was that about?
Howard said he was going to blow his brains out next Tuesday.
what are you talking about? - Didn't you hear him?
Howard said he was going to kill himself next Tuesday.
what do you mean Howard said he was going to kill himself next Tuesday?
he was supposed to do a tag.
he said, "Tune in next Tuesday. I'm going to shoot myself."
what's going on?
he just said he was going to blow his brains out.
what the fuck's going on?
they wanna know what's going on. - I can't hear you.
turn the studio mike on. - We're on in 11 seconds.
ten seconds. - What are you doing? Have you flipped?
we better get him off. - Get him off.
get your fucking hands off me! - Turn the sound off!
he's going on live!
key two. - We're in trouble down here.
go to standby!
Lou, can't we clear out the lobby? There must be 100 people there.
how am I gonna clear 'em out? - Every TV station and wire service!
I could barely get in.
Arthur, anything? - Not so far.
Frank Hackett just walked in. We had to abort the show.
so far over 900 fucking phone calls...
complaining about the foul language.
what page are you putting it on? - Hackett just walked in.
abc again. - Tell 'em to go fuck themselves.
that goes for you, too, Marty.
you're off the air.
he wants to talk to you. - Who's replacing Beale?
we're flying Snowden up. - Everybody hold it.
let's see how the other networks handle this.
the ten o'clock news opened with it. - Good evening. Howard Beale
they'll all make it their lead story.
Howard Beale interrupted his "Network News" program tonight...
to announce he was going to kill himself.
an unusual thing happened at a sister network...
ubs, this evening.
how are we handling it? - Halloway will make a statement...
at the end of the show that Howard's been under great personal stress.
we've got a stockholders' meeting tomorrow...
at which we will announce the restructuring of management plan.
I don't want this grotesque incident to interfere with that.
I'll suggest Mr. Ruddy open with a short statement washing this whole thing off.
you, Max, better have answers for those nuts that always come to the meetings.
Mr. Beale has been under great professional and personal strain.
I've got surprises for you, too!
I've had it up to here with your division...
and it's annual $33 million deficit!
keep your hands off my News Division, Frank.
we're responsible to corporate level, not you.
we'll goddamn well see about that.
all right, take it easy. How do we get Beale out of here?
I understand there are reporters and camera crews in the lobby.
we've got a limo at the freight exit.
Howard, you'll spend the night at my place. There'll be press around yours.
I want Snowden here by noon...
have Lester cover the ClA hearings...
and give the White House to Doris.
you're late for your screening, Max.
right. Okay.
if John Wheeler calls, switch him to projection room 7.
I'm sorry, Bill. This Beale business. - It's all right. Sit down.
Diana asked if she could sit in on this.
fine. How's it going?
you'll like this footage better than the stuff I showed you last time.
Max Schumacher.
goddamn it! When?
did he say anything?
all right, thank you.
the Communist Party believes the most pressing political necessity today is the consolidation of the revolutionary,radical and democratic movements.
Harry, Howard Beale left my house 20 minutes ago.
has he come in yet?
let me know when he arrives.
that's Laureen Hobbs, isn't it? - Yeah.
this is from a David Susskind thing a while back.
I think we can use some of this stuff.
what we're going to see now is something really sensational.
the Flagstaff lndependent Bank of Arizona was ripped off last week...
by a terrorist group called the Ecumenical Liberation Army.
they themselves took movies of the rip-off while they were ripping it off.
the Ecumenical Liberation Army is not the one that kidnapped Patty Hearst?
no, that's the Symbionese Liberation Army.
this is the Ecumenical Liberation Army.
they're the ones who kidnapped Mary Ann Gifford three weeks ago.
there's a lot of liberation armies in the revolutionary underground...
and a lot of kidnapped heiresses.
this is Mary Ann Gifford.
that's the Great Ahmed Khan. He's their leader.
they actually shot this film while they were ripping off the bank?
wait till you see it.
I don't know whether to edit or leave it raw like this.
this is terrific stuff! Where did you get it?
I got everything through Laureen Hobbs.
she's my contact for all this stuff.
I've got Howard on the other line. - Put him on.
I've got Max on four. Pick up.
I'd like another shot.
come on, Howard. - I don't mean the whole show.
I'd like to come on, make some brief farewell statement...
and then turn the show over to Jack Snowden.
I have 11 years at this network. I have some standing in the industry.
I just don't want to go out like a clown.
it'll be simple, dignified. You and Harry can check the copy.
I think it'll take the strain off the show.
what do you think? - Well, okay.
and no booze today, Howard!
no booze.
George, can you come into my office for a minute?
barbara, is Tommy around? I'd like to see the two of you.
this is Bill Herron from our West Coast Special Programs Department.
george Bosch. Barbara Schlesinger. Tommy Pellegrino.
I just saw footage of a special Bill's doing on the revolutionary underground.
most of it's tedious stuff of Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets...
muttering mutilated Marxism...
but he's got eight minutes of a bank robbery...
that is sensational!
authentic stuff shot while the robbery was going on.
remember the Mary Ann Gifford kidnapping?
it's that bunch of nuts. She's in the movie shooting off machine guns.
this is really terrific footage.
we can get a movie of the week out of it, maybe even a series.
a series? What are we talking about?
we've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals, the Ecumenical Liberation Army...
who go around taking home movies of themselves robbing banks.
maybe they'll take movies of themselves kidnapping heiresses...
hijacking 747s...
bombing bridges, assassinating ambassadors.
we'd open each week's segment with their authentic footage...
hire writers to write a story behind that footage, and we've got a series.
a series about a bunch of bank-robbing guerrillas?
what will we call it, the "Mao Tse-Tung Hour"?
why not?
they've got "Strike Force," "Task Force," "SWAT.
why not Che Guevara and his own little "Mod Squad"?
I sent you all a concept analysis report yesterday. Did any of you read it?
well, in a nutshell it said...
the American people are turning sullen.
they've been clobbered on all sides by Vietnam, Watergate, inflation.
they've turned off, shot up, fucked themselves limp, and nothing helps.
so this concept analysis report concludes...
the American people want somebody to articulate their rage for them.
I've told you since I took this job six months ago that I want angry shows.
I don't want conventional programming.
I want counterculture. I want antiestablishment.
I don't want to play butch boss with you people...
but when I took over this department...
it had the worst programming record in television history.
this network hasn't one show in the top 20.
this network is an industry joke.
we better start putting together one winner for next September.
I want a show developed...
based on the activities of a terrorist group.
joseph Stalin and His Merry Band of Bolsheviks.
I want ideas from you. That is what you're paid for.
by the way, the next time I send an audience research report around...
you'd better read it, or I'll sack the lot of you.
is that clear?
I'll be on the coast in four weeks. Can you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs?
the business of management is management.
at the time CCA took control, the UBS TV network was foundering...
with less than seven percent of national television revenues...
most network programs being sold at station rates.
I am pleased to announce I am submitting to the board of directors a plan...
for the coordination of the main profit centers...
and with the specific intention of making each division...
more responsive to management.
point one.
the division producing the lowest rate of return has been the News Division...
with its $98 million budget and its average annual deficit of $32 million.
I know, historically, news divisions are expected to lose money.
to our minds, this philosophy is a wanton fiscal affront...
to be resolutely resisted.
the new plan calls for local news to be transferred to Owned Stations Divisions.
news Radio would be transferred to the UBS Radio Division...
and the News Division would be reduced from an independent division...
to a department accountable to network.
what was that all about, Ed? - This is not the time.
why wasn't I told about this?
why was I led up onto that podium and humiliated in front of the stockholders?
goddamn it! I spoke to John Wheeler this morning...
and he assured me that the News Division was safe.
if you want me to resign, that's a bad way to do it.
we'll talk about this tomorrow at our regular morning meeting.
roll VTA.
bring it up on one. Ready now.
one. - One TVA.
and...
cue announcer.
the "UBS Evening News..."
with Howard Beale.
ready two.
two. Cue power.
good evening. Today is Wednesday, September 24...
and this is my last broadcast.
yesterday I announced on this program...
that I was going to commit public suicide...
admittedly an act of madness.
I'll tell you what happened. I just ran out of bullshit.
cut him off. - Leave him on.
am I still on?
if this is how he wants to go out, this is how he goes out.
I just ran out of bullshit.
Mr. Schumacher's here. Do you want to talk to him?
bullshit is all the reasons we give for living.
if we can't think up reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit.
we don't know why we go through... - What is it?
pointless pain, humiliation and decay.
there better be someone, somewhere who does know. That's the God bullshit.
he's saying that life is bullshit. It is. What are you screaming about?
man is a noble creature who can order his own world. Who needs God?
if there's anybody who can look around this demented world we live in...
and tell me man is a noble creature...
believe me, that man is full of bullshit.
what's so goddamn funny? - I can't help it. It's funny.
this is going out live to 67 affiliates.
leave him on.
and I was married for 33 years of shrill, shrieking fraud.
Mr. Hackett's trying to reach you. - Tell Mr. Hackett to go fuck himself.
so I don't have any bullshit left.
I just ran out of it, you see.
Mr. Ruddy, could we have one statement, please?
sorry, I don't have all the information yet.
if we could just have one statement about Mr. Beale.
Max?
I'll want to see Mr. Beale after this.
the way I hear it, you were primarily responsible...
for this colossally stupid prank.
is that the fact? - That's the fact.
it was unconscionable.
there is nothing more to say. - I have something to say.
I want to know why that debasement of the News Division...
announced at the meeting this afternoon was kept secret from me?
you and I go back 20 years.
I took this job with your personal assurance...
that you'd back my autonomy against any encroachment.
but ever since CCA acquired control of UBS Systems ten months ago...
Hackett's been taking over everything.
who is running this network? You or some conglomerate called CCA?
you're president of the Systems Group.
Hackett's nothing but a hatchet man for CCA.
nelson here, president of the network...
and he hasn't a damned thing to say about anything anymore.
I told you at the stockholders' meeting...
that we would discuss all that at our regular meeting tomorrow morning.
if you had been patient, I would have explained...
that l, too, thought Frank Hackett precipitate...
and that the reorganization of the News Division would not be executed...
until everyone, specifically you, Max...
had been consulted and satisfied.
instead, you sulked off like a child...
and engaged this network in a shocking and disgraceful episode.
your position is no longer tenable...
regardless of how management is restructured.
I will expect your resignation at 10: 00 tomorrow morning.
we will coordinate our statements to the least detriment of everyone.
Bob McDonough will take over the News Division until we sort all this out.
I'd like to see Mr. Beale now.
they're looking for him. They don't know where he is.
well, every day, five days a week for 15 years...
I've been sitting behind that desk, the dispassionate pundit...
reporting with seemly detachment...
the daily parade of lunacies that constitute the news.
just once...
I wanted to say what I really felt.
knock it off.
it was, after all, my last one.
have the overnight ratings come in? - They're on your desk.
have you got yesterday's overnights?
shall I bring them in? - Yeah.
these are the outlines submitted by Universal for an hour series.
you needn't bother to read them. I'll tell them to you.
the first one is set in an eastern law school, presumably Harvard.
the series is irresistibly entitled "The New Lawyers.
the running characters are: a crusty but benign ex-Supreme Court justice...
presumably Oliver Wendell Holmes by way of Dr. Zorba...
a beautiful girl graduate student, and the local district attorney...
who is brilliant and sometimes cuts corners.
next one.
the second one's called "The Amazon Squad.
lady cops.
running characters include a crusty but benign police lieutenant...
who's always getting heat from the commissioner...
a tough, hard-drinking detective who thinks women belong in the kitchen...
and a brilliant, beautiful young cop who's fighting the feminist battle.
we're up to our ears in lady cops.
next is another one of those investigative reporter shows.
a crusty but benign managing editor who's always getting
you know, Barbara...
the Arabs have decided to jack up the price of oil another 20 percent.
the ClA has been caught opening Senator Humphrey's mail.
there's a civil war in Angola. Another one in Beirut.
new York City's still facing default.
they finally caught up with Patricia Hearst.
and the whole front page of the Daily News is Howard Beale.
there's also a two-column story on page one of the Times.
Helen? Call Mr. Hackett's office.
see if he can give me a few minutes this morning.
KTNS Kansas City refuses to carry our "Network News Show" anymore...
unless Beale is taken off the air.
did you see the overnights on the "Network News"?
it has an 8 in New York, a 9 in L. A...
and a 27 share in both cities.
last night, Howard Beale went on the air and yelled "bullshit" for two minutes.
I can tell you tonight's show will get a 30 share at least.
I think we've lucked into something. - For God sakes, Diana!
are you suggesting we put that lunatic back on the air yelling "bullshit"?
Yes, I think we should put Beale back on the air tonight and keep him on.
did you see the news this morning? Did you see the Times?
we got press coverage on this you couldn't buy for a million dollars.
that show jumped 5 points in one night. Tonight's show will be at least 15.
we've just increased our audience by 20 or 30 million people in one night!
you won't get something like this dumped into your lap the rest of your days.
you can't piss it away. Howard said last night what every American feels.
he's tired of all the bullshit! He's articulating the popular rage!
I want that show, Frank.
I can turn that show into the biggest smash on TV.
it's a news show. It's not your department.
I see Howard Beale as a latter-day prophet...
a messianic figure inveighing against the hypocrisies of our times!
a strip Savonarola Monday through Friday...
that will just go through the roof!
and I'm talking about a six-dollar cost per thousand show.
I'm talking about 130, 000 dollar minutes.
figure out the revenues of a strip show that sells for $100, 000 a minute!
one show like that could pull this network out of the hole!
it's being handed to us on a plate. Let's not blow it.
Yes.
tell him I'll be a few minutes.
let me think it over. - Let's not go to committee on this.
it's 10: 20. We want Beale in the studio by 6: 30. We don't want to lose momentum.
for God sakes, we're talking about putting an irresponsible man on national television.
I'd like to talk to Legal Affairs, Herb Thackery...
and Joe Donnelly in Standards and Practices.
you know I'll be eyeball to eyeball with Mr. Ruddy on this.
if I'm going to the mat with Ruddy, I want to be sure of my ground.
my ass is going on the line.
I'll get back to you.
I don't believe the top brass...
of a national television network is sitting around their Caesar salads
top brass of a bankrupt national television network...
with projected losses of $150 million.
I don't care!
you can't be seriously proposing, and the rest of us considering...
putting on a pornographic network news show.
the FCC would kill us. - Sit down, Nelson.
the FCC can't do anything except rap our knuckles.
I don't even want to think about the litigious possibilities.
we could be up to our ears in lawsuits. -The affiliates won't carry it.
the affiliates will kiss your ass if you can hand them a hit show.
but popular reaction-- - We don't know the popular reaction.
that's what we have to find out. - The New York Times
the New York Times doesn't advertise on our network.
all I know is, this violates every canon of respectable broadcasting.
we're not a respectable network. We're a whorehouse network.
we have to take whatever we can get.
I don't want any part of it.
I don't fancy myself the president of a whorehouse.
that's commendable of you, Nelson. Now sit down.
your indignation has been duly recorded.
you can always resign tomorrow.
what in substance are we proposing?
merely to add editorial comment to our network news show.
brinkley, Sevareid, Reasoner all have their comments.
now Howard Beale will have his.
I think we ought to give it a shot, see what happens tonight. Telephone.
I don't want to be the messenger who has to tell Schumacher about this.
he doesn't work at this network anymore. Mr. Ruddy fired him last night.
Bob McDonough is running the News Division now.
Bob McDonough in News, please.
I don't know.
I may teach or write a book
whatever the hell one does when one approaches the autumn of one's years.
my God! Is that me?
was I ever that young?
no, Howard brought in a picture of Ed Murrow...
and the CBS gang when we were there.
you wouldn't believe it!
Walter Cronkite, Harry Reasoner...
Hollenbeck, Bob Trout.
is that you?
Yeah. Okay, Dick, we'll be in touch.
remember this kid you sent to interview Cleveland Amory on vivisection?
what's so funny?
I jump out of bed in my pajamas, I grab my raincoat, I run downstairs.
I run out to the street and hail a cab.
I yell at the driver, "Take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge.
and the driver says, "Don't do it, buddy. Don't do it!
you're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you."
wait a minute.
if you think that's funny, wait till you hear this.
I've come from Hackett's office.
he wants to put Howard back on the air tonight.
apparently the ratings went up five points last night...
and he wants Howard to go back on and do his "angry man" thing.
what are you talking about?
they want Howard to go back on and yell "bullshit.
they want Howard to go on...
spontaneously letting out his anger.
a latter-day prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.
that sounds pretty good!
who's "they"?
Hackett. Chaney was there.
the Legal Affairs guy. Oh, and that girl from programming.
Christensen? What's she got to do with this?
are you kidding? - I'm not kidding.
I said, "We're running a news department here, not a circus.
and Howard Beale's not a bearded lady.
if you think I'll go along with this bastardization of the news...
you can have my resignation along with Max Schumacher's.
I'm speaking for Howard Beale and-- - That's my job you're turning down.
I'd go nuts without some kind of work.
what's wrong with being an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?
what do you think, Max?
do you want to be an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times?
Yeah, I'd like to be an angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our times.
then grab it!
afternoon, Mr. Ruddy. - Afternoon.
good afternoon, Mr. Ruddy.
he's waiting for you. - Thank you.
nelson Chaney tells me Beale may actually go on the air this evening.
as far as I know, Howard's going to do it.
are you gonna sit still for this? - Yes.
I think Hackett's overstepped himself.
there's some kind of corporate maneuvering going on.
Hackett is clearly forcing a confrontation.
that would account for his behavior at the stockholders' meeting.
however, I think he's making a serious mistake with this Beale business.
I suspect CCA will be upset at Hackett's presumptuousness.
certainly Mr. Jensen will.
so I'm going to let Hackett have his head for a while.
he just might lose it over this Beale business.
I'd like you to reconsider your resignation.
I assume Hackett wouldn't take such steps...
without some support on the CCA board.
I'll have to go directly to Mr. Jensen.
when that happens, I'm going to need every friend I've got...
and I don't want Hackett's people in all the divisional positions.
so I'd like you to stay on.
of course.
thank you, Max.
this has been the "UBS Evening News..."
with Howard Beale.
the initial response to the new "Howard Beale Show..."
was not auspicatory.
the press was, without exception, hostile...
and industry reaction negative.
the ratings for the Thursday and Friday shows...
were both 14, but Monday's rating dropped a point...
clearly suggesting the novelty was wearing off.
did you know there are a number of psychics working as licensed broker on Wall Street?
some counsel their clients by use of tarot cards.
they're all pretty successful, even in a bear market and selling short.
I met one of them last week and thought of doing a show around her.
"the Wayward Witch of Wall Street." Something like that.
but if her tips were any good, she could wreck the market.
I called her this morning and asked her how she was on predicting the future.
she said she was occasionally prescient.
for example," she said, "l just had a vision of you...
sitting in an office with a craggy, middle-aged man...
with whom you are or will be emotionally involved.
and here I am.
she does all this with tarot cards?
this one operates on parapsychology.
she has trance-like episodes and feels things in her energy field.
this lady could be very useful to you. - In what way?
you put on a news show.
and here's somebody who can predict tomorrow's news for you.
her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.
sibyl the Soothsayer.
you could give her two minutes of trance...
at the end of the "Howard Beale Show," say once a week, Friday...
which is suggestively occult, and she could oraculate.
then next week everyone tunes in to see how good her predictions were.
maybe she could do the weather.
your "Network News Show" will need help if it's going to hold.
Beale doesn't do the "angry man" thing well at all.
he's too kvetchy. He's being irascible.
we want a prophet, not a curmudgeon. He should do more apocalyptic doom.
I think you should have some writers write some jeremiads for him.
I see you don't fancy my suggestions.
you're not serious?
I'm serious.
the fact is, I could make your Beale show the highest-rated news show in TV if you'd let me have a crack at it.
what do you mean, "have a crack at it"?
I'd like to program it for you.
develop it.
I wouldn't interfere with the news itself, but TV is show biz...
and even the news has to have a little showmanship.
my God, you are serious.
I watched your six o'clock news today. It's straight tabloid.
you had a minute and a half of that lady riding naked in Central Park...
but you had less than a minute of hard national and international news.
it was all sex, scandal, brutal crime, sports...
children with incurable diseases and lost puppies.
so I won't listen to protestations of high standards of journalism...
when you're on the streets, soliciting audiences like the rest of us.
all I'm saying is, if you're going to hustle, at least do it right.
I'm going to bring this up at tomorrow's meeting, but I don't like hassles.
I was hoping we could work this out between us. That's why I'm here.
and I was hoping you were looking for an emotional involvement...
with a craggy, middle-aged man.
I wouldn't rule that out entirely.
all right, Diana...
bring up all your ideas at the meeting, because if you don't, I will.
I think Howard's making a goddamn fool of himself...
and so does everybody that Howard and I know in this industry.
it was a fluke. Didn't work.
so tomorrow, Howard goes back to the old format...
and all of this gutter depravity comes to an end.
I don't get it.
you hung around until 7: 30 and then came down here...
just to pitch a couple of loony show-biz ideas...
when you knew goddamn well I'd laugh you right out of the office.
I don't get it.
what's your scam in this?
my visit here tonight was a gesture made out of your stature in the industry...
and because I personally admired you since I was a kid...
majoring in speech at the University of Missouri.
sooner or later, with or without you, I'm going to take over your news show.
I figured I might as well start tonight.
I think I once gave a lecture at the University of Missiouri.
I was in the audience. I had a schoolgirl crush on you for months.
if we could get back for a moment to that gypsy who predicted...
all that about emotional involvements and middle-aged men...
what are you doing for dinner tonight?
I can't make it tonight. Call me tomorrow.
do you have a favorite restaurant? - I eat anything.
I get a feeling I'm being made.
you are.
I've got to warn you. I don't do anything on my first date.
we'll see.
schmuck, what are you getting into?
I was married for four years and pretended to be happy.
I had six years of analysis and pretended to be sane.
my husband ran off with his boyfriend...
and I had an affair with my analyst who told me I was the worst lay he ever had.
I can't tell you how many men have told me what a lousy lay I am.
I apparently have a masculine temperament.
I arouse quickly, consummate prematurely...
and I can't wait to get my clothes back on and get out of that bedroom.
I seem to be inept at everything except my work.
I'm good at my work.
so I confine myself to that.
all I want out of life is a 30 share and a 20 rating.
you're married, surely?
twenty-five years.
I have a married daughter in Seattle who's six months pregnant...
and a younger girl who's starting at Northwestern in January.
well, Max, here we are.
middle-aged man reaffirming his middle-aged manhood...
and a terrified young woman with a father complex.
what sort of script can we make out of this?
corridor gossip says that you're Frank Hackett's backstage girl.
I'm not.
Frank's a corporation man, body and soul.
he has no loves, lusts or allegiances...
that are not consummately directed toward becoming a CCA board member.
why should he bother with me? I'm not even a stockholder.
what about your loves, lusts and allegiances?
is your wife in town?
Yes.
then we better go to my place.
I can't hear you. You'll have to talk a little louder.
Yes, I hear you.
Yes.
Yes.
why me?
I said, "Why me?
Howard in his office?
I'm killing this whole screwball "angry prophet" thing.
tonight we go back to straight news.
yeah? Max, I'm telling you he's fine.
he's been sharp all day. He's been as funny as hell.
had everybody cracking up at the rundown meeting.
I told him!
cue VTA.
ready two.
cue announcer. - The "UBS Evening News..."
with Howard Beale.
last night I was awakened from a fitful sleep...
shortly after 2: 00 in the morning...
by a shrill, sibilant, faceless voice.
I couldn't make it out at first in the dark bedroom.
I said, "I'm sorry. You'll have to talk a little louder.
what do you want me to do? - Nothing.
the voice said to me, "l want you to tell the truth.
not easy to do, because the people don't want to know the truth.
I said, "You're kidding?
what should I know about the truth?
but the voice said to me, "Don't worry about the truth.
I will put the words in your mouth.
I said, "ls this the burning bush?
I'm not Moses.
the voice said, "I'm not God. What has that got to do with it?
the voice said, "We're not talking about eternal, absolute truth.
we're talking about impermanent, transient, human truth!
I don't expect people to be capable of truth...
but at least you're capable of self-preservation.
I said, "Why me?
the voice said, "Because you're on television, dummy.
beautiful.
forty million Americans listen to you, and after the show, maybe 50 million.
I'm not asking you to walk the land in sackcloth preaching the Armageddon.
you're on TV.
I thought about it for a moment.
then I said, "Okay."
close the door, Harry.
Howard, I'm taking you off the air.
I think you're having a breakdown, require treatment.
this is not a psychotic episode.
this is a cleansing moment of clarity.
I'm imbued.
I'm imbued with some special spirit. It's not a religious feeling at all.
it's a shocking eruption of great electrical energy.
I feel vivid and flashing...
as if suddenly I'd been plugged into a great electromagnetic field.
I feel connected to all living things.
to flowers, birds...
all the animals of the world...
and even to some great, unseen living force
what I think the Hindus call "prana."
but it's not a breakdown.
I've never felt more orderly in my life.
it is a shattering and beautiful sensation.
it is the exalted flow of the space-time continuum...
save that it is spaceless and timeless...
and such loveliness.
I feel on the verge of some great ultimate truth.
and you will not take me off the air for now or any other spaceless time!
is he okay? - He's just fainted.
I better get him back to my house again tonight.
help me get him up.
this is crazy.
the whole place has gone crazy. They just seem to hassle me.
wake up, Max, because Howard's gone.
I'll make you some coffee.
you don't know where he is? The son of a bitch is a hit!
goddamn it! Over 2, 000 phone calls!
in the mail room, over 14, 000 telegrams! The response is sensational!
tell him. Herb's phone hasn't stopped ringing.
every affiliate from Albuquerque to Sandusky! Response is sensational!
Yes. All right.
for you, Herb. Go to your office.
Moldanian called me. Joe Donnelly called me. We've got a goddamn hit!
show him the Times. We even got an editorial in the New York Times.
a Call to Morality. - I don't know where he is.
that crazy Beale has caught on. Don't tell me you don't know where he is.
he could be jumping off a roof for all I know!
the man is insane! He's not responsible for himself!
he needs care and treatment.
all you grave robbers think about is that he's a hit.
it's just possible that he isn't insane...
that he is, in fact, imbued with some special spirit.
I'm supposed to be the romantic! You're the hard-bitten realist!
all right. Howard Beale obviously fills a void.
the audience obviously wants a prophet...
even a manufactured one-- even if he's as mad as Moses.
by tomorrow he'll have a 50 share, maybe a 60.
Howard Beale is processed instant God.
it looks like he may go over bigger than Mary Tyler Moore.
I am not putting Howard back on the air!
it's not your show anymore. It's mine.
I gave her the show.
I'm putting the "Network News Show" under programming.
Mr. Ruddy had a heart attack and is not taking calls.
in his absence, I'm making all network decisions...
including one I've been wanting to make a long time: you're fired.
I want you out of this building by noon.
I'll call security and have you thrown out if you're still here.
well, let's say fuck you, Hackett.
you want me out of here...
you'll have to drag me and the whole News Division out kicking and screaming.
you think they'll quit their jobs for you? Not in this recession.
ruddy will have your ass.
I got a hit! Ruddy doesn't count anymore!
he was hoping I'd fall on my face with this Beale show, but I didn't.
it's a big, fat, big-titted hit...
and I don't have to waffle around with Ruddy anymore.
if he wants to take me before the CCA board, let him.
do you think Ruddy is stupid enough to go to the CCA board and say...
I'm taking our one hit show off the air.
come November 14, I'll be at the annual CCA Management Review Meeting...
and I'll announce projected earnings for this network...
for the first time in five years!
believe me, Mr. Jensen will be sitting there, rocking back and forth...
and he'll say, "That's very good, Frank. Keep it up."
so don't have illusions about who's running this network. You're fired.
I want you out of your office before noon, or I'll have you thrown out.
you go along with this?
I told you I didn't want a network hassle.
I told you I'd much rather work the Beale show out between us.
well, let's just say fuck you, too, honey.
Howard Beale may be my best friend. I'll go to court.
I'll put him in a hospital before I let you exploit him like a carnival freak.
you get your psychiatrist. I'll get mine.
I'm gonna spread this reeking business in every newspaper...
on every network, group and affiliate in this country!
I'm gonna make a lot of noise about this!
we need all the press we can get!
something going on between you and Schumacher?
not anymore.
how do you do, Mr. Beale? - I must make my witness.
sure thing, Mr. Beale.
oil ministers of the OPEC nations meeting in Vienna...
still haven't decided how much to increase the price of oil.
yeah? He came in the building five minutes ago.
tell Snowden when he comes in to let him go on.
did you get that, Paul?
more on that story from Edward Fletcher in Vienna.
this has been the most divisive meeting the oil states have ever had.
the 13 nations of OPEC have still not...
been able to decide by how much to increase the price of oil.
how much time we got?
we've got five seconds. Hurry up.
take two. Cue Howard.
I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad.
it's a depression.
everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job.
the dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust.
shopkeepers keep guns under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street.
nobody anywhere seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.
we know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
we sit watching our TVs while some newscaster tells us...
that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes...
as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
we know things are bad. Worse than bad. They're crazy.
everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
we sit in the house. Slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller.
all we say is, "Please. At least leave us alone in our living rooms.
let me have my toaster, my TV my steel-belted radials.
I won't say anything Just leave us alone."
I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad!
I don't want you to protest or riot.
don't write to your congressman. I don't know what to tell you to write.
I don't know what to do about depression, inflation...
the Russians, the crime in the streets.
all I know is that first you've got to get mad!
you've got to say, "I'm a human being, goddamn it!
my life has value!"
so, I want you to get up now.
I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
I want you to get up now and go to the window...
open it, stick your head out and yell...
I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"
I want you to get up right now.
stay with him. - Sit up! Go to your windows.
open them, stick your head out and yell...
I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"
how many stations does it go out live? - Sixty-seven.
I'm not gonna take this anymore.
then we'll figure out what to do about the depression and the oil crisis.
open the window, stick your head out and yell...
I'm as mad as hell...
and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
who are you talking to? - Atlanta.
are they yelling in Atlanta?
but first you've gotta get mad.
you've gotta say, "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"
they're yelling in Baton Rouge.
get up!
son of a bitch! We've struck the mother lode!
stick your head out of the window and keep yelling.
yell, "I'm as mad as hell.
I'm not gonna take this anymore."
just get up from your chairs.
where you going? - I want to see if anybody's yelling.
open it and stick your head out.
yell and keep yelling
I'm mad as hell!
I'm not gonna take this anymore!
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
by mid-October, the "Howard Beale Show" had settled in at a 42 share...
more than equaling all the other network news shows combined.
in the Nielsen ratings, the "Howard Beale Show..."
was the fourth-highest-rated show of the month...
surpassed only by "The Six Million Dollar Man," "All in the Family..."
and "Phyllis..."
a phenomenal state of affairs for a news show.
on October 15, Diana Christensen flew to Los Angeles...
for what the trade calls powwows and confabs...
with her West Coast programming execs...
and to get production rolling on the shows for the coming season.
Christ! You brought half the William Morris West Coast Office along with you.
I'm Diana Christensen, a racist lackey of the imperialist ruling circles.
I'm Laureen Hobbs, a bad-ass commie nigger.
sounds like the basis of a firm friendship.
we'll need more chairs. - Anybody want coffee?
I'd love some.
this is my lawyer, Sam Haywood, and his associate, Merrill Grant.
miss Christensen, just what the hell's this all about?
because, when a national television network...
in the person of booby here comes to me and says...
they want to put the ongoing struggle of the oppressed masses...
on prime-time television...
I have to regard this askance!
Mr. Haywood was saying that our client, Miss Hobbs...
wants it up front that the political content of the show has to be in her control.
she can have it. I don't give a damn about the political content.
what kind of show?
I'm interested in doing a weekly dramatic series...
based on the Ecumenical Liberation Army...
and the first show has to be a two-hour special on Mary Ann Gifford.
I want a lot more film like the bank rip-off the Ecumenical sent in.
the way I see the series is...
each week we open with an authentic act of political terrorism...
taken on the spot and in the actual moment.
then we go to the drama behind the opening film footage.
that's your job, Miss Hobbs.
you've got to get the Ecumenicals to bring in that film footage for us.
the network can't deal with them. They are wanted criminals.
the Ecumenical Liberation Army is an ultra-left sect...
creating political confusion...
with wildcat violence and pseudo-insurrectionary acts...
which the Communist Party does not endorse.
the American masses are not yet ready for open revolt.
we would not want to produce a television show...
celebrating historically deviational terrorism.
I'm offering you an hour of prime-time television every week...
into which you can stick whatever propaganda you want.
the Ecumenicals are an undisciplined ultra-left gang...
whose leader is an eccentric, to say the least.
he calls himself the Great Ahmed Khan and wears a hussar's shako.
we're talking about 30 to 50 million people a shot.
it's better than handing out...
mimeographed pamphlets on ghetto street corners.
I'll have to take this matter to the Central Committee.
and I'd better check it out with the Great Ahmed Khan.
I'll be in L. A. until Saturday, and I'd like to get it rolling.
well, Ahmed, you ain't gonna believe this...
but I'm gonna make a TV star outta you.
just like Archie Bunker.
you gonna be a household word.
what the fuck are you talking about?
thirty seconds. - Ready VTA.
three, you're on the announcer.
twenty.
stand by VTA.
ready A. - Roll VTA.
three, cue announcer!
ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it! How do you feel?
we're mad as hell...
and we're not gonna take this anymore!
ladies and gentlemen, the "Network News Hour..."
with Sybil the Soothsayer...
Jim Webbing and his It's-The-Emmes-Truth Department...
miss Mata Hari and her skeletons in the closet.
plus tonight, another segment of "Vox Populi."
and starring the Mad Prophet of the Airways, Howard Beale!
edward George Ruddy died today!
edward George Ruddy was the chairman of the board of the Union Broadcasting Systerms.
and he died at 11: 00 this morning of a heart condition.
woe is us! We're in a lot of trouble!
so, a rich little man with white hair died.
what does that got to do with the price of rice, right?
and why is that woe to us?
because you people...
and 62 million other Americans are listening to me right now.
because less than three percent of you people read books.
because less than 15 percent of you read newspapers.
because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube.
right now, there is a whole and entire generation...
that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube!
this tube is the Gospel. The ultimate revelation.
this tube can make or break...
presidents, popes, prime ministers.
this tube is the most awesome goddamn force in the whole godless world...
and woe is us if it ever falls into the hands of the wrong people!
and that's why woe is us that Edward George Ruddy died.
because this company is now in the hands of CCA...
the Communication Corporation of America.
there's a new chairman of the board, a man called Frank Hackett...
sitting in Mr. Ruddy's office on the 20th floor.
and when the 12th largest company in the world...
controls the most awesome, goddamn propaganda force...
in the whole godless world...
who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this network!
so you listen to me. Listen to me!
television is not the truth.
television's a goddamned amusement park!
television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats...
storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks...
Iion tamers and football players.
we're in the boredom-killing business.
so if you want the truth, go to God.
go to your gurus.
go to yourselves!
because that's the only place you're ever gonna find any real truth.
but, man, you're never gonna get any truth from us.
we'll tell you anything you wanna hear. We lie like hell.
we'll tell you that Kojak always gets the killer...
and that nobody ever gets cancer in Archie Bunker's house.
and no matter how much trouble the hero is in, don't worry.
look at your watch. At the end of the hour he'll win!
we'll tell you any shit you want to hear!
we deal in illusions. None of it is true!
but you people sit there, day after day, night after night.
you're all ages, colors, creeds. We're all you know.
you're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning here.
you're beginning to think the tube is reality and your own lives are unreal.
you do whatever the tube tells you!
you dress like the tube, eat like the tube...
raise your children like the tube, even think like the tube.
this is mass madness, you maniacs!
in God's name, you people are the real thing!
we are the illusion!
so turn off your television sets. Turn them off right now.
turn them off and leave them off.
turn them off in the middle of this sentence.
turn them off!
ubs was running at a cash flow of break-even point...
after taking into account $110 million of negative cash flow from the network.
it was clear the fat on the network had to be flitched off.
please note an increase in projected initial programming revenues...
in the amount of $21 million...
due to the phenomenal success of the "Howard Beale Show.
I expect a positive cash flow for the entire complex of 45 million...
achievable in this fiscal year...
a year, in short, ahead of schedule.
beyond that...
this network may be the most significant profit center of the communications complex and based upon the projected rate of return on invested capital.
and if merger is accomplished, the communications complex may well become the towering and most profitable center in the entire CCA empire.
I await your questions and comments.
Mr. Jensen?
very good, Frank. Exemplary. Keep it up.
buy you a cup of coffee?
hell, yes.
do you have to get back to the office?
nothing that can't wait.
I drop down to the news studios now and then...
and ask Howard Beale about you.
he says you're doing fine. Are you?
are you keeping busy?
in a fashion.
this is the third funeral I've been to in two weeks.
I have two other friends in the hospital whom I visit regularly.
I've been to a couple of christenings.
all my friends seem to be dying or having grandchildren.
you should be a grandfather yourself about now.
you have a pregnant daughter in Seattle, don't you?
any day now.
my wife's out there for the occasion.
I've thought many times of calling you.
I wish you had.
I bumped into Sybil the Soothsayer in the elevator last week.
I said, "You know, Sybil, about four months ago...
you predicted I would get involved with a craggy, middle-aged man.
so far, all that's happened has been one many-splendored night.
I don't call that getting involved.
she said, "Don't worry. You will."
it was a many-splendored night, wasn't it, Max?
Yes, it was.
are we going to get involved?
Yes. I need to become involved very much.
how about you?
I've reached for the phone to call you a hundred times...
but I was sure you hated me for my part in taking your news show away.
I probably did. I don't know anymore.
all I know is, I can't get you out of my mind.
Marty, I know what NBC offered them.
go to 3. 5, and I want an option for a third run on all of them.
I'm in a big hurry, and you and Charlie are supposed to be negotiating this.
good-bye, good luck. I'll see you Monday.
Jimmy Caan's agent says absolutely nix. -You can't win them all.
where can I reach you later today? - You can't. I'll be gone all weekend.
nbc's offering 3. 25 mil per package of five James Bond movies...
and I think I'm gonna steal them for 3. 5...
with a third run.
I'm gonna stick the "Mao Tse-tung Hour" in at 8: 00...
because we're having a lot of trouble selling the "Mao Tse-tung Hour.
that "Mao Tse-tung Hour's" turning into one big pain in the ass.
we're having heavy legal problems with the federal government right now.
two FBl guys turned up in Hackett's office and served us with a subpoena.
they heard about our Flagstaff bank rip-off film, and they want it.
Hackett told the FBl to fuck off.
we're getting around the FBl...
by doing the show in collaboration with the news division.
we're standing on the First Amendment: freedom of the press...
and the right to protect our sources.
Walter thinks we can knock out the misprision of felony charge.
but he says absolutely nix on going to series.
they'll hit us with "conspiracy with an inducement to commit a crime.
Christ, it's cold in here.
we're paying these Ecumencial Liberation Army nuts $10, 000 a week...
in order to turn in authentic film of their revolutionary activities.
that inconstitutes "inducement to commit a crime..."
and Walter says we'll all wind up in federal prison.
I said, "Walter, let the federal government sue us.
we'll take them to the Supreme Court.
we'll be front page.
the New York Times and the Washington Post...
will write editorials.
we'll be front page for months. We'll have more press than Watergate.
all I need is six weeks federal litigation...
and the "Mao Tse-tung Hour" can start carrying its own time slot.
what's really bugging me now is my daytime programming.
nbc's got a lock on daytime...
with their lousy game shows...
and I'd like to bust them.
I'm thinking of doing a homosexual soap opera. "The Dykes.
the heartrending saga about a woman...
hopelessly in love with her husband's mistress.
what do you think?
how long has it been going on?
a month.
I thought it was a transient thing, blow over in a week.
I still pray to God it's just a menopausal infatuation.
but it is an infatuation, Louise.
there's no sense in my saying I won't see her again, because I will.
you want me to leave, check into a hotel?
do you love her?
I don't know how I feel.
I'm grateful I can feel anything.
I know I'm obsessed with her.
then say it!
don't keep telling me that you're obsessed, you're infatuated!
say that you're in love with her.
I'm in love with her.
then get out! Go anywhere you want. Go live with her, but don't come back!
because after 25 years of building a home and raising a family...
and all the senseless pain that we have inflicted on each other...
I'm damned if I'll stand and have you say you're in love with somebody else!
this isn't the convention weekend with your secretary, is it?
or some broad that you picked up after three belts of booze.
this is your great winter romance, isn't it?
your last roar of passion before you settle into your emeritus years.
is that what's left for me? Is that my share?
she gets the winter passion, and I get the dotage?
am I supposed to sit home knitting and purling...
while you slink back like some penitent drunk?
I'm your wife, damn it...
and if you can't work up a winter passion for me...
the least I require is respect and allegiance!
I hurt! Don't you understand that?
I hurt badly!
Oh, say something for God's sake.
I've got nothing to say.
I won't give you up easily.
I think perhaps it is better if you move out.
does she love you?
I'm not sure she's capable of any real feelings.
she's television generation. She learned life from Bugs Bunny.
the only reality she knows comes to her from over the TV set.
she's very carefully devised a number of scenarios for all of us to play...
Iike a movie of the week.
my God, look at us.
here we are going through the obligatory middle-of-act-two scorned wife throws peccant husband out" scene.
but don't worry, I'll come back to you in the end.
all of her plot outlines have me leaving her and coming back to you...
because the audience won't buy a rejection of the happy American family.
she does have one script in which I kill myself.
an adapted-for-television version of "Anna Karenina..."
where she's Count Vronsky and I'm Anna.
you're in for some dreadful grief.
I know.
the "Mao Tse-tung Hour" went on the air March 14.
it received a 47 share.
the network promptly committed to 15 shows with an option for 10 more.
there were the usual contractual difficulties.
equal to 20 percent except that such a percentage shall be 30 percent...
for 90 minutes or longer television programs.
have we settled that sub-licensing thing?
we want a clear definition here.
gross proceeds should consist of all funds the sub-licensee receives...
not merely the net amount remitted...
after payment to the sub-licensee or distributor.
we're not sitting still for overhead charges as a cost prior to distribution.
don't fuck with my distribution costs!
I'm making a lousy 215 per segment.
I'm already deficiting 25 grand a week with Metro!
I'm paying William Morris 10 percent off the top!
I'm giving this turkey ten thousand per segment and five to this fruitcake.
and, Helen, don't start no shit with me about a piece again.
I'm paying Metro 20 percent for all foreign and Canadian distribution...
and that's after recoupment!
the Communist Party won't see a nickel outta this show until syndication.
the Party's in for 7, 500 a week production expenses!
I'm not giving this pseudo-insurrectionary a piece.
I won't give him script approval or cut him in on my distribution charges.
you fucking fascist!
did you see the film we made of the San Marino jail breakout...
demonstrating the rising up of a seminal prisoner class infrastructure?
you can blow the seminal prisoner class infrastructure out your ass!
I'm not knocking down my goddamn distribution charges!
man, give her the fucking overhead clause.
who's gonna believe this?
let's get back to page 22. Five, small "a.
subsidiary rights.
where are we now? -Middle of page 22, "Subsidiary rights.
as used herein, 'subsidiary rights' means without limitation any and all
over the past two days, you've had opportunity to meet Diana Christensen...
our vice president in charge of programming.
this afternoon, you all saw some of the stuff she's set up for the new season.
you all know that she is the woman behind the "Howard Beale Show."
we all know she's beautiful.
we all know she's brainy.
I was thinking, before we start digging into our chateaubriands...
Iet's show her how we feel about her.
we've got the number one show in television!
at next year's affiliates' meeting, I'll be telling you we've got the top five!
last year, we were the number four network.
next year, we're number one!
we're number one!
we're number one!
it is exactly 7: 00 here in Los Angeles...
and right now over a million homes using television in this city...
are turning their dials to channel three...
and that's our channel!
Howard Beale!
stop it! Stop it!
listen to me, and listen carefully...
because this is your goddamn life I'm talking about today.
in this country, when one company wants to take over another company...
they simply buy up a controlling share of the stock...
but first they have to file notice with the government.
that's how CCA took over the company that owns this network.
but now somebody's buying up CCA.
somebody called the Western World Funding Corporation.
they filed the notice this morning.
who in the hell is the Western World Funding Corporation?
it is a consortium of banks and insurance companies...
who are not buying CCA for themselves but as agents for somebody else.
and who is this somebody else? They won't tell you.
they won't tell you. They won't tell the Senate.
they won't tell the SEC, the FCC, the Justice Department.
this is Mr. Hackett. Do you have a New York call for me?
do you want to turn that down, please?
I will tell you who they're buying CCA for.
they're buying it for the Saudi Arabian lnvestment Corporation.
they're buying it for the Arabs!
Clarence? Frank Hackett here. How's everything back in New York?
how's the good lady?
take it easy. I don't know what you're talking about.
when? Tonight's show?
Clarence, take it easy.
the "Howard Beale Show" is just going on out here. You get it 3 hours earlier.
take it easy! How the hell could I see it? It's just going on now!
when did Mr. Jensen call?
we all know that the Arabs control...
$16 billion in this country.
they own a chunk of Fifth Avenue, 20 downtown pieces of Boston...
a part of the port of New Orleans, an industrial park in Salt Lake City.
they own big hunks of the Atlanta Hilton...
the Arizona Land and Cattle Company...
the Security National Bank in California...
the Bank of the Commonwealth in Detroit.
they control Aramco, so that puts them into Exxon, Texaco and Mobil Oil.
they're all over! New Jersey, Louisville, St. Louis, Missouri.
and that's only what we know about. There's more we don't know about.
because all of those Arab petrol dollars are washed...
through Switzerland and Canada and the biggest banks in this country.
for example, what we don't know about is this CCA deal...
and all the other CCA deals.
right now the Arabs have screwed us out of enough American dollars...
to come right back and with our own money...
buy General Motors, lBM, lTT, AT&T...
du Pont, U. S. Steel and 20 other American companies.
hell, they already own half of England!
listen to me.
listen to me, goddamn it!
the Arabs are simply buying us.
there's only one thing that can stop them! You!
you!
so I want you to get up now.
I want you to get up out of your chairs.
I want you to get up right now and go to the phone.
I want you to get up from your chairs, go to the phone...
get in your cars, drive into the Western Union offices in town.
I want you to send a telegram to the White House.
Oh, my God. - By midnight tonight...
I want a million telegrams in the White House!
I want them wading knee-deep in telegrams at the White House.
I want you to get up right now and write a telegram to President Ford...
saying "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore!
I don't want the banks selling my country to the Arabs!
I want the CCA deal stopped now!
I want the CCA deal stopped now!
come on. I want the CCA deal stopped now!
could we have the room? - Sure.
I'd like to see a typed script and run through a couple more times.
but as for this whole CCA deal...
with the Saudis, you know a lot more about that, Frank, than I would.
is it true?
the CCA has two billion in loans with the Saudis...
and they hold every pledge we've got.
we need that Saudi money bad.
the show is a disaster.
unmitigated disaster! The death knell.
I'm ruined. I'm dead. I'm finished.
maybe we're overstating Beale's clout with the public.
an hour ago, Clarence McElheny called me from New York.
it was 10: 00 in the East...
and our people in the White House report they were knee-deep in telegrams.
by tomorrow morning, they'll be suffocating in telegrams!
can the government stop the deal?
they can hold it up. The SEC could hold it up for 20 years if they wanted to.
I'm finished.
any second that phone's gonna ring, and Clarence McElheny...
is gonna tell me Mr. Jensen wants me in his office tomorrow morning...
so he can personally chop my head off!
four hours ago, I was the sun god at CCA
Mr. Jensen's handpicked golden boy, the heir apparent.
now, I'm a man without a corporation.
let's get back to Howard Beale.
you're not seriously gonna pull Beale off the air.
Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale and wants him discontinued.
he may be unhappy, but he isn't stupid enough...
to withdraw the number one show on television out of pique.
two billion dollars isn't pique! That's the wrath of God!
and the wrath of God wants Howard Beale fired!
what for? Every other network will grab him. He'll be on the air for ABC.
I'm gonna impale the son of a bitch with a sharp stick through the heart.
we'll lose $40 million in revenues.
I'll take a contract out on him. I'll hire professional killers.
no, I'll do it myself.
I'll strangle him with a sash cord. Jesus!
I don't think Jensen's gonna fire anybody.
Yes, Clarence. I've already booked my flight.
can you give me a little more time than that? I've got the red-eye flight.
I won't be back in New York till 6: 00 tomorrow morning.
that'll be just fine.
I'll see you then.
Mr. Jensen wants to meet with Howard Beale personally.
he wants Mr. Beale in his office at 10: 00 tomorrow morning.
the final revelation is at hand!
I have seen the shattering vulgarizations of ultimate clarity.
the light is impending. I bear witness to the light!
good morning, Mr. Beale. They tell me you're a madman.
only desultorily.
how are you now? - I'm as mad as a hatter.
who isn't?
I'm taking you into our conference room.
seems more seemly a setting for what I have to say to you.
I started as a salesman.
I sold sewing machines, automobile parts...
hair brushes and electronic equipment.
they say I can sell anything.
I'd like to try to sell something to you.
valhalla, Mr. Beale.
please sit down.
you have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Beale...
and I won't have it!
is that clear?
you think you merely stopped a business deal.
that is not the case.
the Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country...
and now they must put it back!
it is ebb and flow, tidal gravity. It is ecological balance!
you are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples.
there are no nations. There are no peoples.
there are no Russians. There are no Arabs.
there are no Third Worlds. There is no West.
there is only one holistic system of systems!
one vast and immane, interwoven, interacting...
multi-variant, multinational dominion of dollars!
petrol dollars, electro dollars, multi-dollars.
Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds and shekels!
it is the international system of currency...
which determines the totality of life on this planet.
that is the natural order of things today.
that is the atomic...
and subatomic...
and galactic structure of things today.
and you have meddled...
with the primal forces of nature!
and you will atone!
am I getting through to you?
you get up on your little 21-inch screen...
and howl about America and democracy.
there is no America.
there is no democracy.
there is only lBM and lTT...
and AT&T...
and Du Pont, Dow, Union Carbide...
and Exxon.
those are the nations of the world today.
what do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state?
Karl Marx?
they get out their linear programming charts...
statistical decision theories, minimax solutions and compute...
price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments like we do.
we no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. Beale.
the world...
is a college of corporations...
inexorably determined...
by the immutable bylaws of business.
the world is a business.
it has been since man crawled out of the slime.
and our children will live, Mr. Beale...
to see that...
perfect world...
in which there's no war or famine...
oppression or brutality.
one vast and ecumenical holding company...
for whom all men will work to serve a common profit...
in which all men will hold a share of stock...
all necessities provided...
all anxieties tranquilized...
all boredom amused.
and I have chosen you, Mr. Beale...
to preach this evangel.
why me?
because you're on television, dummy!
sixty million people watch you...
every night of the week, Monday through Friday.
I have seen the face of God.
you just might be right, Mr. Beale.
that evening Howard Beale went on the air...
to preach the corporate cosmology of Arthur Jensen.
last night I got up here and asked you to fight for your heritage...
and you did, and it was beautiful.
six million telegrams were received at the White House.
the Arab takeover of CCA has been stopped.
the people spoke, the people won.
it was a radiant eruption of democracy.
but I think that was it, fellas.
that sort of thing is not likely to happen again...
because at the bottom of all our terrified souls...
we know that democracy is a dying giant...
a sick, sick, dying, decaying political concept...
writhing in its final pain.
I don't mean that the United States is finished as a world power.
the U. S is the richest, most advanced country in the world
Iight-years ahead of any other country
and the Communists won't take over the world because they're deader than we.
what is finished...
is the idea that this great country...
is dedicated to the freedom and flourishing of every individual in it.
it's the individual that's finished.
it's the single, solitary human being that's finished.
it's every single one of you out there that's finished.
because this is no longer a nation of independent individuals.
it's a nation of some 200 million transistorized, deodorized...
whiter-than-white, steel-belted bodies...
totally unnecessary as human beings...
and as replaceable as piston rods.
well, the time has come to say...
is "dehumanization" such a bad word?
whether it's good or bad, that's what is so.
the whole world is becoming humanoid...
creatures that look human but aren't.
the whole world, not just us.
we're just the most advanced, so we're getting there first.
the whole world's people are becoming mass-produced...
programmed, numbered and
it was an admissible argument that Howard Beale...
advanced in the days that followed.
it was, however, also a very depressing one.
nobody particularly cared to hear his life was utterly valueless.
by the end of the first week in June...
the show dropped one ratings point...
and its trend of shares dipped under 48 for the first time...
since last November.
you're his goddamn agent, Lou!
I'm counting on you to talk sense into the lunatic!
nobody wants to hear about dying democracy and dehumanization!
I'm sorry I'm late.
we're getting rumbles from the agencies. The sponsors will bail out soon!
this is a breach of contract!
this isn't the Howard Beale we signed. Get him off the corporate universe kick.
I'll pull him off the air!
I told him! I've been telling him every day for a week!
I am sick of telling him! Now you tell him!
Jesus Christ!
you could help me with Howard. He listens to you. You're his best friend.
I'm tired of all this hysteria about Howard Beale!
every time you come back from seeing somebody in your family...
you're in a morbid, middle-aged mood!
and I'm tired of finding you on the goddamn phone every time I turn around!
I'm tired of being an accessory in your life!
I'm tired of pretending to write this dumb book...
about my maverick days in the early years of television.
every goddamned executive fired from a network in the last 20 years...
has written this dumb book about the great early years of television!
and nobody wants a dumb, damn, goddamn book about the early days of television!
terrific. Maybe you can start a whole new career as an actor!
after living with you for six months, I'm turning into one of your scripts!
this is not a script.
there's some real, actual life going on here.
I went to visit my wife today because she's in a state of depression
so depressed that my daughter flew from Seattle to be with her
and I feel lousy about that.
I feel lousy about the pain that I've caused my wife and kids.
I feel guilty and conscious-stricken and those things you think sentimental...
but which my generation called simple human decency.
and I miss my home...
because I'm beginning to get scared shitless.
because all of a sudden it's closer to the end than it is to the beginning...
and death is suddenly a perceptible thing to me...
with definable features.
you're dealing with a man that has primal doubts...
and you've got to cope with it.
I'm not some guy discussing male menopause on the "Barbara Walters Show.
I'm the man that you presumably love.
I'm part of your life.
I live here.
I'm real!
you can't switch to another station.
well...
what exactly is it you want me to do?
I just want you to love me.
I just want you to love me, primal doubts and all.
you understand that, don't you?
I don't know how to do that.
I'll be with you in a minute, Max.
by the first week in July, the "Howard Beale Show" was down 11 points.
hysteria swept through the network.
he's a plague! He's smallpox! He's typhoid!
I don't want to follow his goddamn show! I want out of the 8: 00 spot.
I've got enough troubles without Howard Beale as a lead-in.
you guys scheduled me up against "Tony Orlando and Dawn"!
nbc's got "Little House on the Prairie." ABC's got "The Bionic Woman.
you gotta do something about Howard Beale!
get him off the air! Get him off!
do something! Do anything!
we're trying to find a replacement! I'm going to look at audition footage now!
and how when the sick heal!
man, I tell you I saw it!
it was heavy, baby.
I saw the earth quake...
and I saw the moon became like blood.
and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
no, no, damn it! If we wanted hell-fire, we'd get Billy Graham!
we don't want faith healers, evangelists or Oberammergau passion players!
what about that terrific new messiah ABC was to sign for our competition?
that's him.
that's him?
Jesus. Turn him off!
I've got three more, but you've already seen the best ones.
I've got a guru from Spokane...
and two more hell-fires who see visions of the Virgin Mary.
we're not gonna find a replacement for Beale. Let's stop kidding ourselves.
fully-fledged messiahs don't come in bunches.
we either go with Howard Beale or we go without him.
my reports say we'll do better without him.
it would be disaster to let this situation go on another week.
by then he'll be down 16 points...
and the trend irreversible, if it isn't already.
I think we should fire Howard.
Arthur Jensen has taken a strong personal interest in the "Howard Beale Show."
I'm having dinner with him tonight.
let me have another crack at Jensen. Meet in my office at 10: 00 tonight.
Diana, give me copies of all your audience research reports.
I may need them for Jensen.
is 10: 00 convenient for everyone?
I think the time has come to reevaluate our relationship, Max.
so I see.
I don't like the way this script of ours is turning out.
it's turning into a seedy little drama.
middle-aged man leaves wife and family for young, heartless woman, goes to pot.
"the Blue Angel" with Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings.
I don't like it. - So you're gonna cancel the show.
right. - Let me do that.
the simple fact is, Max...
that you're a family man.
it's beautiful you like a home and kids, but I am incapable of such commitment.
all you'll get from me is another couple of months of intermittent sex...
and recriminate and ugly little scenes like the one we had last night.
I'm sorry for all those things I said to you last night.
you're not the worst fuck I've ever had.
believe me, I've had worse.
you don't puff or snorkel and make death-like rattles.
as a matter of fact, you're rather serene in the sack.
why is it that a woman always thinks that the most savage thing...
she can say to a man is to impugn his cocksmanship?
I'm sorry I impugned your cocksmanship.
I gave up comparing genitals back in the schoolyard.
you're being docile as hell about this.
hell, Diana, I knew it was over with us weeks ago.
will you go back to your wife?
I'll give it a try, but I don't think she'll jump at it.
don't worry about me.
I'll manage. I always have, I always will.
I'm more concerned about you.
you're not the boozer type.
so I figure a year, maybe two, before you crack up...
or jump out of your 14th floor office window.
stop selling, Max. I don't need you.
I don't want your pain! I don't want your menopausal decay and death!
I don't need you, Max! Get out! - You need me!
you need me badly! Because I'm your last contact with human reality.
I love you!
and that painful, decaying love is the only thing between you...
and the shrieking nothingness you live the rest of the day.
then don't leave me.
it's too late.
there's nothing left in you that I can live with.
you're one of Howard's humanoids. If I stay with you, I'll be destroyed.
like Howard Beale was destroyed.
like Laureen Hobbs was destroyed.
like everything you and the institution of television touch is destroyed.
you're television incarnate.
indifferent to suffering...
insensitive to joy.
all of life is reduced to the common rubble of banality.
war, murder, death...
are all the same to you as bottles of beer.
and the daily business of life is a corrupt comedy.
you even shatter the sensations of time and space...
into split seconds and instant replays.
you're madness, Diana.
virulent madness.
and everything you touch dies with you.
but not me.
not as long as I can feel pleasure...
and pain...
and love.
and it's a happy ending.
wayward husband comes to his senses...
returns to his wife...
with whom he's established a long and sustaining love.
heartless young woman left alone in her arctic desolation.
music up with a swell.
final commercial.
and here are a few scenes from next week's show.
how'd it go?
Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea of taking Howard Beale off the air.
Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale is bringing...
a very important message to the American people.
so he wants Howard Beale on the air, and he wants him kept on.
Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic in our thinking.
I argued that television was a volatile industry...
in which success and failure were determined week by week.
Mr. Jensen said he did not like volatile industries...
and suggested with a certain sinister silkiness...
that volatility in business usually reflected bad management.
he didn't really care if Howard Beale was the number one show or the 50th.
he didn't really care if the Beale show lost money.
he wants Howard Beale on the air...
and he wants him kept on.
I would describe his position on this as inflexible.
where does that put us, Diana?
that puts us in the shithouse. That's where that puts us.
do you want me to go through this?
the Beale show Q score is down to 33.
most of this loss occurred in the child and teen and 18-34 categories...
which were our key core markets.
it's the AR department's carefully considered judgment, and mine...
that if we get rid of Beale, we should maintain a respectable share...
with a comparable Q level.
the other show segments, Sybil the Soothsayer, Jim Webbing, Vox Populi...
have all developed their own audiences.
our AR reports show that it is Beale that is the destructive force here.
Minimally, we're talking about...
a ten-point differential in shares.
I think Joe oughta spell it out for us.
a 28 share is 80, 000 dollar minutes.
I think we can sell complete positions on the whole.
as a matter of fact, we're just getting into the pre-Christmas gift-sellers...
and the agencies are coming back to me with four-dollar CPMs.
if that's any indication, we're talking $40-$45 million loss in annual revenues.
want the flak from the affiliates? - We know all about it, Herb.
you would describe Mr. Jensen's position on Beale as inflexible?
intractable and adamantine.
what do we do about this Beale son of a bitch?
I suppose we'll have to kill him.
I don't suppose you have any ideas on that, Diana?
well...
what would you fellas say to an assassination?
I think I can get the Mao Tse-tung people...
to kill Beale for us as one of their shows.
in fact, it'll make a hell of a kick-off show for the season.
we're facing heavy opposition on the other networks for Wednesday nights...
and the "Mao Tse-tung Hour" could use a sensational opener.
it could be done right on camera in the studio.
we oughta get a fantastic look-in audience...
for the assassination of Howard Beale as our opening show.
if Beale dies...
what would our continuing obligation to the Beale Corporation be?
I know our contract with Beale contains a buy-out clause...
triggered by his death or incapacity.
there must be a formula for the computation of the purchase price.
offhand, I think it was based on a multiple of 1975 earnings...
with a base period in 1975, which I think was 50 percent...
of salary, plus 25 percent of the first year's profit...
multiplied by the unexpired portion of the contract.
I don't think the show...
has any substantial syndication value, would you say, Diana?
syndication profits are minimal.
we're talking about a capital crime.
the network can't be implicated.
I hope you don't have any hidden tape machines in this office, Frank.
the issue is, shall we kill Howard Beale or not?
I'd like to hear some more opinions on that.
I don't see we have any option. Let's kill the son of a bitch.
ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it!
how do you feel?
we're mad as hell...
and we're not gonna take this anymore!
ladies and gentlemen, the "Network News Hour" with Sybil the Soothsayer...
Jim Webbing and his It's-the-Emmes-Truth Department.
miss Mata Hari and her skeletons in the closet.
tonight another segment of "Vox Populi."
and starring the Mad Prophet of the Airways, Howard Beale!
...network news anchorman on the UBS "Network News Show..."
known to millions as the Mad Profit of the Airwaves...
was shot to death tonight in a fusillade of automatic rifle fire...
just as he began this evening's broadcast.
we never compromise, so why should you?
canada Dry Mixers. Why compromise?
have you seen the other side of where you live?
what's this stuff? - Some cereal. It's good for you.
did you try it? - I'm not gonna try it. You try it.
I'm not gonna try it.
let's get Mikey to try it! - Yeah!
he won't eat it. He hates everything.
the extraordinary incident occurred in full view of his millions of viewers.
the assassins were members of the Ecumenical Liberation Army...
two of whom were apprehended.
the leader of the group known as the Great Ahmed Khan escaped.
this was the story of Howard Beale...
the first known instance of a man who was killed because he had lousy ratings.
you WILL NOT GROW OLD...
you WILL NOT DIE...
I've BEEN WAITING I THINK SHE WAS THERE. - WHO?
the ONE. THE ONE WHO WILL MAKE ME OLD LIKE YOU.
I'm A 65-YEAR-OLD MAN.
you're ALSO MY SON.
if DEAD BODIES MAKE YOU QUEASY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HOMICIDE?
did YOU EVER LOCATE MY JOHN DOE?
you WANT TO TELL ME HOW YOU GOT UP FROM THE DEAD AND WALKED OUT OF MY E. R?
detective, THIS IS MY HUSBAND ROBERT CAMP.
pleased TO MEET YOU.

Hey, I CAN'T HELP IT. I HAVE A VIVID DREAM LIFE.

I WAS GETTING CLOSER, THEN...
out OF NOWHERE...
a WHALE SURFACED...
and SWALLOWED ME. HEH.

trapped INSIDE THE WHALE,
but ALIVE.
maybe YOU CAN FOOL THE DOG,
but THAT STORY AIN'T ABOUT YOU.
that's JONAH.
Hey. IT'S MY DREAM. - UH-OH.
december 19, 2003.
Yeah. A TEMPORARY GLITCH.
Dr. SARA MILLAY DILLANE, "DAUGHTER OF MARY DILLANE AND FRANKLIN DILLANE "WAS MARRIED FRIDAY
to ROBERT CAMP.
that DON'T SOUND TEMPORARY TO ME.
how MANY TIMES YOU BEEN MARRIED?
enough TO KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOREVER.
I'm JUST SAYING MAYBE SHE AIN'T THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS.
it's MY DREAM, OK?
I KNOW, ROBERT. IT'S SO CONFUSING.
half THE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL.
YEAH--YES, I CARE FOR YOU, TOO,
but THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES.
all RIGHT, DON'T YELL AT ME, ROBERT.
this IS ONE OF THE ISSUES I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YEAH--I JUST
I NEED SOME MORE TIME.
Yes, I KNOW MARRIAGE IS HARD. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.
OK, I GOTTA GO.
NO--I GOTTA GO.
?Excuse ME? -I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
hang ANOTHER UNIT. SHE'S GOING DOWN FAST.
what's HER BP? - 60 OVER 40.
Oh, SWELL. - THANKS FOR THE CALL, FRANK. -NO PROBLEM.
where THE HELL'S THE CHEST X-RAYS?
detective AMSTERDAM. DOES SHE HAVE A NAME?
Yeah, MARY WORTH. LIKE THE COMIC STRIP.
Mary? DO YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS?
Hey, LOOK, DUDE, NOT NOW. LET US DO OUR WORK.

multiple STAB WOUNDS.
and SHE WAS RAPED.

every 10 YEARS.
black, ONE SUGAR.
how'd YOU KNOW? - IT'S HOW I DRINK IT.

not AT WORK.
you're SEPARATED.
is IT THAT OBVIOUS?
marriage...
it's HARD.
Yeah. WELL...
I've GOT THE SCARS TO PROVE IT.

well, THAT'LL DEPEND ON WHETHER YOU'LL HAVE DINNER WITH ME TONIGHT.
I'm ON A SHIFT. - TOMORROW NIGHT.
I TRY NOT TO MIX MY PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES.

Yeah, YOU'RE IRRESISTIBLE.

I HAVE GOOD KARMA.
I HATE IT WHEN A VIC DOESN'T DIE AT THE SCENE.
damn EMTs DESTROY THE PLACE.
if IT WAS UP TO SANTORI,
everyone WOULD DIE AT THE PRECINCT RIGHT NEXT TO HIS DESK.
what ARE YOU STARING AT?
this PARK WAS ORIGINALLY CALLED LANG MESJE.
dutch FOR LONG KNIFE.
ironic, GIVEN THE WAY SHE WAS KILLED.
and THAT'S IMPORTANT WHY?
well, IT WAS THE NAME FOR A CREEK THAT RAN THROUGH HERE.
the SOIL STILL HAS A SANDY QUALITY.
good FOR CASTING SHOE PRINTS LIKE THESE.
now, WE'LL NEED TO COMPARE THEM WITH THE EMTs' SHOES. - right ??? I TALKED TO THE FIRST OFFICER ON THE SCENE.
he SAID THE VIC'S CLOTHES WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY RIPPED OFF.
he SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN SO MUCH BLOOD.

we GOT MORE INFO ON MARY WORTH. - SHE WAS A NUN. URSULINE ORDER.

I CAUGHT A CAB UPTOWN.
the DRIVER WANTED TO GO THROUGH THE PARK.

he ASKED ME IF I COULD HELP HIM.
when I CAME OUT TO LOOK, HE GRABBED ME BY THE HAIR
and PULLED ME INTO THE PARK.
then WHAT HAPPENED, AMARTYA?
he PUSHED ME TO THE GROUND.
he SMELLED OF OIL. PATCHOULI OIL. I KNOW THE SCENT FROM INDIA.
and HE TORE OFF MY SKIRT. AND HE DID IT.
he PENETRATED YOU?
he-- HE HAD THIS KNIFE, AND, UH...
I BIT HIS HAND...
and, UH...
he TRIED TO CUT ME...
and I KNEED HIM IN THE, YOU KNOW.
and HE SCREAMED, AND I ROLLED AWAY.
and HE CHASED ME, UM...
but IT-- IT WAS DARK.
and I HID IN SOME TREES.
and THEN...
I CAME HERE.
is THERE ANYTHING YOU NEED? ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR YOU?
you're SAFE NOW.
really, I DON'T FEEL SAFE.
it's OK. I'M HERE.
I'm HERE.
who ARE YOU?
NYPD. DETECTIVES AMSTERDAM AND MARQUEZ.
I'm CHARVI VIKRAM, HER SISTER.
thank YOU FOR COMING, BUT THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE.
I WISH IT WAS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER VICTIMS OUT THERE.
he MAY HAVE RAPED AND KILLED A NUN LAST NIGHT.
AMARTYA, COULD YOU GIVE US A DESCRIPTION?
he WAS TALL, WHITE...
TALL-- HOW TALL? TALLER THAN ME?
please LEAVE HER ALONE! SHE'S BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH TONIGHT.
I WANT TO GO HOME. - DID YOU NOTICE THE TAXI NUMBER?
just 2 LETTERS--X98.
that's ENOUGH. THIS CAN'T BECOME PUBLIC.
she WON'T BE PRESSING CHARGES.
ms. VIKRAM, SHE'S THE ONLY WITNESS WHO CAN IDENTIFY A SERIAL RAPIST AND MURDERER.
I'm SORRY, I CAN'T. - PLEASE LEAVE!
AMARTYA, THINK OF THE NEXT VICTIM.
Johanna, DON'T FORGET THE GOOSEBERRY JAM.
Mr. DURST LIKES IT ON HIS SCONE.
you HUNGRY, JOHN? THERE'S BACON.
Oh, NOT THIS MORNING.
have YOU SEEN FANNY?
she's BEEN AROUND.
do YOU NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT HER?
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
does SHE SEEM SAD?
she's A WOMAN.
you KNOW SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME.
it's BETTER LEFT AS IT IS. - WHAT IS?
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN STEALING EXTRA FLOUR TO FEED YOUR FAMILY, CATHERINE.
I DON'T THINK MR. DURST WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT.
don't YOU KNOW, JOHN, DURST'S FAVORITE SPORT IS DEFLOWERING.
that's THE ONLY FLOUR HE CARES ABOUT.
13 YEARS AGO, IT WAS MY TURN.
now IT'S FANNY'S.
what DO YOU GOT? - CROSS-REFERENCED THE TAXI MEDALLION NUMBERS
with THE SPECIAL VICTIMS DATABASE. GOT A HIT.
the GUY WAS POPPED 3 YEARS AGO FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.
the D. A. DECLINED TO PROSECUTE BECAUSE THE VICTIM REFUSED TO COOPERATE.
Phillip LONG. LIVES IN JERSEY.
tall. 6'3." ALL SYSTEMS GO. - HOLD THE ELEVATOR.
get OUT OF THE WAY! GET OUT OF THE WAY!
head HIM OFF!
I CUT HER.
shoot HIM. - SHUT UP!
is THAT AN ARMY RANGER KNIFE, PHIL?
tactical FIXED BLADE, SERRATED EDGE? MAN, I ALWAYS WANTED ONE OF THOSE.
I WAS IN THE RANGERS, YOU KNOW. WHITCOMB'S RANGERS. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
you PROBABLY NEVER HEARD OF THEM.
shut UP! I'LL KILL HER, I SWEAR!
no, YOU WON'T, PHIL. COME ON.
you ONLY KILL WOMEN YOU'VE RAPED.
you're A DIABETIC, HUH? THAT'S TOUGH. WHOA.
everything SWELLS UP.
Hey. ALL THIS MIGHT JUST BE A PROBLEM OF LOW BLOOD SUGAR.
go AHEAD, MOVE.
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA BE IMPRESSED.
the LENGTHS I'LL GO TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM AS YOU.
there ARE OTHER DOCTORS.
you REALLY THINK I GOT STABBED JUST TO SEE YOU?
now, THAT'S A LITTLE NARCISSISTIC.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. YOU'RE A VERY STRANGE MAN.
you HAVE NO IDEA.
see HOW FAST YOUR BLOOD CLOTS?
I GOT BACK SOME MORE OF YOUR TESTS.
your PLATELET LEVEL IS 10 TIMES NORMAL,
and YOU HAVE VERY LOW LEVELS OF FACTOR 8.
I LOVE IT WHEN YOU TALK MEDICAL.
you HAVE A NICE LAUGH, SARA. YOU SHOULD DO IT MORE OFTEN.
I TOLD YOU I COULDN'T HELP YOU. - CAN WE TALK TO YOU ALONE?
we CAUGHT THE GUY, AMARTYA.
but WE NEED YOU TO COME DOWN AND IDENTIFY HIM IN A LINEUP.
with THE DNA SAMPLE AND THE OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,
the D. A. SAID IT'S AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE.
then WHY DO YOU NEED ME? - YOU'RE THE SOLE WITNESS.
would I HAVE TO TESTIFY? - YOU MAY. BUT...
it'll SEND HIM AWAY FOR A LONG TIME.
what's THE DEAL? WE'RE RUNNING AN HOUR BEHIND.
NYPD. HOMICIDE.
Hey. I'M BEN ROBINSON. I'M SHOOTING HER COLLECTION.
you OK?
she TOLD ME. HOPE YOU NAIL THE BASTARD.
we HAVE. - HE SHOULD ROT IN PRISON.
we're WORKING ON IT.
I TOLD HER SHE SHOULD TAKE A PASS ON THIS COLLECTION.
she INSISTED ON DOING IT.
it's BETTER IF I'M WORKING.
you HAVE OUR NUMBER. - THINK ABOUT WHAT WE SAID.
I KNOW, FANNY.
he's RUINED ME.
he CAN'T TAKE FROM YOU WHAT YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN.
he...he WAS DRUNK.
he WAS TOO STRONG. I TRIED TO FIGHT HIM.
did YOU?
how CAN YOU ASK ME THAT, JOHN?
I've LOST THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT.
you HONOR.
you.
I SAVED MYSELF FOR YOU.
are YOU SURE HE CAN'T SEE US? - ABSOLUTELY SURE.
do YOU RECOGNIZE ANY OF THESE MEN?
number 3.
number 3, TAKE 2 STEPS FORWARD.
where DO YOU KNOW HIM FROM?
he's THE MAN WHO RAPED ME.
get HIM OUT OF HERE.
come ON.
he'll NEVER TOUCH YOU AGAIN.
John DIDN'T TELL ME HE HAD SUCH A RADIANT NEW PARTNER.
I DON'T THINK RADIANT WOULD BE THE WORD HE'D USE.
how LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN HIM?
seems LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE. - REALLY?
so WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH HIM?
he's A GREAT DETECTIVE, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
he's LIKE A SAVANT. BUT...
he's GOT THIS BIZARRE SENSE OF HUMOR.
this WEIRD PAST LIVES THING,
and HE ACTS LIKE HE DOESN'T CARE IF HE GETS KILLED.
Oh, HE CARES, BELIEVE ME.
you SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER, OMAR.
she TOOK DOWN THIS GUY ALL BY HERSELF, SINGLE-FOOTED.
I HAD IT ALL UNDER CONTROL, UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP.
there IT IS.
you're FAMOUS.
who WAS APPREHENDED EARLIER TODAY,
was FREED THIS EVENING ON BAIL.
charges HAVE BEEN REDUCED AFTER THE D. A. ADMITTED
there WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE DNA EVIDENCE.
Mr. LONG'S ATTORNEY ACCUSED THE PRIMARY WITNESS OF BEING A PUBLICITY SEEKER.
an ONLINE GOSSIP SITE HAS IDENTIFIED HER
as DESIGNER AMARTYA VIKRAM.
ms. VIKRAM REFUSED ANY COMMENT.
and IN OTHER NEWS, SANITATION WORKERS
please, I JUST CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.
you HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE UPSET.
they SAID MY NAME ON TV.
it's LIKE A NIGHTMARE THAT KEEPS GOING ON AND ON.
many YEARS AGO I HAD A FRIEND.
she WAS MORE THAN A FRIEND,
she WAS--SHE WAS FUNNY AND DECENT, AND THEN
a MAN SHE WORKED FOR RAPED HER. BRUTALLY.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. I DIDN'T LISTEN.
and WHAT I DID HURT HER MORE.
all SHE NEEDED WAS TO FEEL
feel SAFE, PROTECTED.
I DIDN'T DO THAT FOR HER. I'D LIKE TO DO IT FOR YOU.
haven't YOU DONE ENOUGH?
now EVERYONE KNOWS WHO SHE IS.
the RAPIST KNOWS. HE'S PROBABLY SENT HER A GIFT BASKET.
we CAN OFFER HER POLICE PROTECTION IF SHE WANTS IT.
we'll TAKE CARE OF HER.
I TOLD YOU, IT'S A FAMILY MATTER.
you HAVE TO EAT, GIRL. - WHY?
how ARE YOU, JOHN?
how SHOULD HE BE?
he's DRINKING MY WINE.
you, JOHANNA.
fetch ME A GLASS.
it's LIKE SILK.
reminds ME OF YOUR MOTHER'S.
here's YOUR WINE.
watch YOURSELF, COACHMAN.
what's MINE IS MINE.
Yeah.
I'm GLAD YOU CALLED.
I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.
change.
it's VERY DIFFICULT.
before I WENT OUT ON MY OWN,
I WORKED FOR THE BIG HOUSES.
NOVET, GAULTIER.
when I FINALLY STARTED MAKING MONEY, I BROUGHT MY FAMILY OVER.
they LIVED IN A SMALL TOWN OUTSIDE OF BANGALORE.
I RENTED A PLACE FOR THEM ON THE UPPER WESTSIDE AND...
they DIDN'T LIKE IT.
too AMERICAN.
too MODERN.
so, THEY MOVED TO LITTLE INDIA.
jackson HEIGHTS. -yes
hey RUN A STORE WITH MY SISTER.
my PARENTS DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHAT I DO.
it's PROBABLY BETTER THAT WAY.
it's A LOVELY NAME.
it MEANS IMMORTAL.
Really?
I WISH I FELT THAT WAY TODAY.
we'll GET HIM, AMARTYA.
you CAN STAY HERE UNTIL WE CAN ARRANGE MORE FORMAL SECURITY.
omar WILL LOOK AFTER YOU.
is CHARVI YOUR ONLY SIBLING?
I HAVE 2 BROTHERS AND A YOUNGER SISTER.
but SHE DIED.
what ABOUT YOU? ARE YOU MARRIED?
not PRESENTLY, NO.
but YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN MIND.
Yes.
then YOU SHOULDN'T WAIT.
in MY RELIGION, WE BELIEVE IN REINCARNATION,
but I THINK THE REASON THE SOUL KEEPS ON TRAVELING THROUGH TIME
is TO FIND ITS MATE.
if YOU'VE FOUND HER, YOU SHOULD DO EVERYTHING NOT TO LOSE HER.
care FOR A RIDE, MILADY?
what ARE YOU DOING?
following THE ADVICE OF A VERY WISE YOUNG WOMAN.
you ARE A STRANGE MAN.
do YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THIS THING?
I've HAD SOME PRACTICE, YEAH.
may I?
everything CHANGES. THAT'S THE ONE CONSTANT.
all THESE HOUSES WERE STABLES.
if WE WANTED TO GO TO WASHINGTON SQUARE, WE'D PARK THE CARRIAGES HERE.
you TALK ABOUT IT LIKE YOU WERE THERE. - I WAS.
when THE AUTOMOBILE REPLACED HORSES, THEY BECAME ARTISTS' STUDIOS.
dreiser, O'NEILL, E. E. CUMMINGS, THEY ALL LIVED AROUND HERE.
I LOVE E. E. CUMMINGS.
for LIFE'S NOT A PARAGRAPH, AND DEATH I THINK IS NO PARENTHESIS.
Yes.
good POET.
mean DRUNK.
do YOU BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE?
that's A BIG QUESTION.
Oh, IT'S THE ONLY QUESTION.
do YOU MEAN IS THERE ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD
for EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US?
couldn't HAVE SAID IT BETTER.
total FAIRY TALE.
made UP BY MADISON AVENUE TO SELL COSMETICS.
Really? - MM-HMM.
and BY MOTHERS TO KEEP THEIR DAUGHTERS VIRTUOUS.
frankly, I'VE ALWAYS FELT SORRY FOR WOMEN WHO'VE BOUGHT INTO THAT MYTH.
like I SAID, CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT.
I NEED TO GET IT.
yeah?
I'll BE RIGHT THERE.
it's AMARTYA.
constable? CAN I HAVE A WORD?
you MAY HAVE 2,
if YOU'RE WILLING TO PAY TWICE AS MUCH.
it's A PRIVATE MATTER.
in MY JOB, ALL MATTERS ARE PUBLIC.
buy ME A PINT AND I MIGHT CONSIDER IT.
I'll DO MORE THAN THAT.
proceed.
I WORK FOR ANDREW DURST.
I ACCUSE HIM OF RAPE AND ASSAULT. - ARE YOU THE VICTIM, THEN?
a MAID. AND OTHERS IN HIS HOUSEHOLD.
durst SHOULD BE PUT AWAY. HE'S A SAVAGE.
but A WEALTHY ONE.
how MUCH ARE YOU OFFERING?
all I HAVE.
but NOT ALL I HAVE.
the GENTLEMAN IS INNOCENT.
feel BETTER?
no.
she WASN'T A PRISONER. SHE CHOSE TO GO.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT HER.
he ONLY WENT IN THE KITCHEN TO MAKE HER SOME FOOD.
when HE CAME OUT, SHE WAS GONE. WHAT COULD YOU HAVE DONE?
do WE KNOW WHO CALLED HER?
we REQUESTED AN EMERGENCY DUMP ON HER PHONE.
long MUST HAVE FOLLOWED HER TO OMAR'S AND THEN WAITED FOR HER TO LEAVE.
the STAB WOUNDS LOOK DIFFERENT TO ME. - HOW?
no SERRATED EDGE, MAYBE A CURVED BLADE.
so HE USED A DIFFERENT KNIFE. I MEAN, HE HAD TO.
we HAVE THE ORIGINAL WEAPON. - AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF RAPE.
listen, WE GOT A FIX ON LONG. YOU WANT TO PAY HIM A VISIT?
you TAKE IT. I'M GONNA LOOK INTO HER PHOTOGRAPHER.
you WERE SEEING AMARTYA.
did SHE TELL YOU THAT?
well, I KNOW SHE TRUSTED YOU ENOUGH TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE RAPE.
you CALLED HER LAST NIGHT.
it WAS ON HER CELL RECORDS.
I LEFT A MESSAGE.
she NEVER CALLED BACK.
yet HERE YOU ARE, BUSINESS AS USUAL.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
work's THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME SANE.
we WERE ENGAGED.
hadn't TOLD ANYONE YET. - WHY?
her FAMILY DIDN'T APPROVE.
I'm AMERICAN. I'M A JEW.
her FAMILY'S STILL LIVING IN THE MIDDLE AGES.
figure IT OUT.
well, SINCE YOU'RE HERE, WE COULD USE MORE WINE.
get IT YOURSELF.
you CAN ALWAYS TELL WHERE MY COACHMAN IS...
by THE SMELL OF HORSE DUNG.
and YOU ARE A THIEF.
not LIKELY. I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED.
of HONOR.
women's HONOR.
you MEAN THAT WHORE FANNY.
she HAD NO HONOR TO LOSE.
and SINCE YOU'RE HARDLY A GENTLEMAN, NEITHER DO YOU.
I DEMAND SATISFACTION,
if YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN.
you KNOW THAT THE ONE WHO IS CHALLENGED CHOOSES THE PLACE, - THE DISTANCE, AND THE WEAPON? - THEN DO IT.
pistols.
10 PACES.
in THE GARDEN AT DAWN.
I ACCEPT.
take HONOR FROM ME AND MY LIFE IS DONE.
honor.
a WORD WE ALMOST NEVER HEAR ANYMORE, 36.
not IN AMERICA.
it USED TO MEAN VIRTUE,
nobility.
now...
it's BECOME JUST ANOTHER REASON TO KILL.
maybe IT WAS ALWAYS THAT WAY.
do YOU HAVE A WARRANT?
then GET OUT OF MY STORE!
I'm LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL. - WE'RE CLOSED.
look, DETECTIVE...
I'm SURE YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS BEST,
but MY SISTER IS DEAD,
and NOTHING YOU CAN DO NOW WILL BRING HER BACK.
tell ME ABOUT YOUR OTHER SISTER. - MAYA?
she DIED A FEW YEARS AGO, BEFORE WE CAME HERE.
how?
an ACCIDENT.
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
it's PAINFUL, THAT KIND OF LOSS.
the THING IS, I CHECKED IT OUT, IN THE BANGALORE TIMES.
it WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.
she WAS MURDERED, WASN'T SHE?
stabbed. AN HONOR KILLING.
you WERE THE ONE WHO CALLED THEM, AREN'T YOU?
I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
she TRUSTED YOU, AND THAT WAS HER MISTAKE.
she WASN'T SCARED OF THE RAPIST, WAS SHE?
she WAS SCARED OF HER FAMILY.
if THEY FOUND OUT SHE'D BEEN RAPED,
who KNOWS WHAT THEY'D DO?
well, AMARTYA KNEW.
her SISTER MAYA HAD ALREADY PAID THE PRICE.
you HAVE NO PROOF.
you PICKED HER UP THAT NIGHT
and TOOK HER TO MEET SOMEBODY. SOMEBODY WHO HAD A
a KNIFE LIKE THIS.
will YOU BE NEXT, CHARVI?
you CANNOT UNDERSTAND!
your SISTER BROUGHT YOU HERE.
she SUPPORTED YOU. SHE LOVED YOU.
she DESERVED SO MUCH BETTER.
no SECOND.
why AM I NOT SURPRISED?
I HAVE NO NEED TO DRAG OTHERS INTO MY AFFAIRS.
do YOU APOLOGIZE?
you KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.
it's JUST AS WELL.
your DEATH WILL BE APOLOGY ENOUGH.
long's COPPING A PLEA.
that's GOOD.
we FOUND ANOTHER WITNESS WHO I. D.'D HIM FOR THE MARY WORTH KILLINGS.
you OK?
Yeah.
I'm SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
why YOU ASK ME HERE?
for TORTURE?
we ONLY DO THAT TO GUILTY PEOPLE.
Charvi WAS VERY UPSET AFTER YOU COME.
she DO NOT TELL ME WHAT IT IS ABOUT.
Amartya. - YES.
someone ONCE SAID THAT...
to OUTLIVE YOUR CHILDREN IS THE WORST TRAGEDY.
no ONE CAN KNOW.
no.
the REASON I ASKED YOU HERE WAS TO DELIVER SOME GOOD NEWS.
the MAN WHO RAPED YOUR DAUGHTER HAS CONFESSED.
I PRAY TO SHIVA FOR THAT.
he ADMITTED TO RAPING AMARTYA...
and KILLING HER.
I HOPE THIS PROVIDES SOME COMFORT TO YOUR FAMILY.
Yes.
I WANTED TO TELL YOU MYSELF
before IT WAS SPLASHED ALL OVER THE NEWS.
he SAY HE KILL HER?
he ALSO...
described THE RAPE IN DETAIL.
unfortunately, THAT WILL ALSO BE IN THE PAPERS.
bastard.
he'll GET WHAT HE DESERVES.
ready...
he SAID HE STABBED HER, MR. VIKRAM.
over AND OVER...
he SAID HE RAPED HER A SECOND TIME BEFORE HE KILLED HER.
he's AN ANIMAL.
he RAPE HER AGAIN?
no
it-- IT CANNOT BE.
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR.
no. NO. SHE WAS NOT RAPED AGAIN.
how DO YOU KNOW THAT? - I KNOW.
were YOU THERE?
good SHOT.
not PERFECT, BUT...GOOD.
now IT'S MY TURN.
Mr. VIKRAM, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
I DO NOT WANT TO BE SILENT.
this MAN, HE TRIED TO STEAL WHAT IS MINE.
I ONLY DO WHAT I MUST FOR MY FAMILY.
you KILLED HER. - YES.
I, UH, I CONSIDER THIS MATTER SETTLED.
but I DON'T.
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER. SHE UNDERSTAND. THIS IS OUR WAY.
as A MAN, I DO WHAT I MUST.
as YOU DID TO YOUR OTHER DAUGHTER.
you DO NOT KNOW.
how CAN YOU?
your WORLD, IT IS NOT MY WORLD.
now, LOOK...
I HAVE MONEY. I CAN OPEN DOORS FOR YOU.
where I LIVE...
without HONOR THERE IS NO LIFE.
there IS NOTHING.
you HAVE NOTHING THAT I WANT.
come ON.
we'll HAVE TO PICK UP CHARVI.
she's A CO-CONSPIRATOR. - YOU KNEW HE WANTED TO CONFESS.
he WANTED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW WHAT HE'D DONE.
that's THE POINT OF HONOR KILLINGS.
it SHOULD BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE.
murdering WOMEN FOR FALLING IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE DIFFERENT.
leaving AN ABUSIVE MARRIAGE.
or...
getting RAPED.
there's NO HONOR IN THAT.
what IS IT ABOUT WOMEN THAT SCARES US SO MUCH?
there's ONE WAITING FOR YOU.
why DON'T YOU ASK HER?
hi
let's GO.
I CAN COME WITH YOU.
no. I KILLED A GENTLEMAN.
they'll COME AFTER ME. IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE FOR YOU.
I DON'T CARE. - I DO.
I DID YOU A GREAT WRONG, FANNY.
I--I FAILED YOU WHEN YOU NEEDED ME MOST.
he'll NEVER LAY A HAND ON YOU AGAIN.
what WILL HAPPEN TO ME NOW?
if YOU CARE FOR ME AT ALL, FANNY,
you WILL LIVE TO A RIPE OLD AGE.
you WILL MARRY, YOU'LL HAVE MANY CHILDREN,
and YOU'LL BE HAPPY.
I've WAITED A VERY LONG TIME FOR THIS.
who?
the one. The one who will make me old like you.
I'm a 65-year-old man.
you're also my son.
if dead bodies make you queasy, what are you doing in homicide?
did you ever locate my john doe?
you want to tell me how you got up from the dead and walked out of my E. R?
detective, this is my husband Robert Camp.
pleased to meet you.
what?
Hey, I can't help it. I have a vivid dream life.
it was--it was night. I was swimming in the ocean.
bone tired. No sign of land.
and then, uh, suddenly, a boat in the distance and a woman's voice.
I swam towards her...
I was getting closer, then...
out of nowhere...
a whale surfaced...
and swallowed me.
thing was, I was still alive, trapped inside the whale, but alive.
maybe you can fool the dog, but that story ain't about you.
it's my dream.
WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS Sara Dillane, Robert Camp
Yeah. A temporary glitch.
Dr. Sara Millay Dillane,"daughter of Mary Dillane and Franklin Dillane "was married Friday to Robert Camp.
that don't sound temporary to me.
how many times you been married?
enough to know it's supposed to be forever.
I'm just saying maybe she ain't the girl of your dreams.
it's my dream, ok?
I know, Robert.
it's so confusing. Half the time I don't know what I feel.
Yeah--yes, I care for you, too, but there are other issues.
all right, don't yell at me, Robert.
this is one of the issues I'm talking about.
Yeah--I just-- I need some more time.
Yes, I know marriage is hard.
I don't know how long.
OK, I gotta go.
No--I gotta go.
I'll call you later.
hang another unit. She's going down fast.
what's her bp?
Oh, swell.
thanks for the call, Frank. - No problem.
where the hell's the chest x-rays?
detective Amsterdam. Does she have a name?
Yeah, Mary Worth.
like the comic strip.
Mary? Do you know who did this? Mary?
Hey, look, dude, not now. Let us do our work.
this is my E. R. You want me to call security?
she's in v-fib.
get the cart.
charge to 360. - Charge
clear!
look familiar?
wait for me.
what's up?
Dr. Dillane, tube her.
she expired.
the body can only stand so much trauma.
multiple stab wounds.
and she was raped.
guess she's in your court now.
you ever think about doing something else?
every 10 years.
black, one sugar.
how'd you know?
it's how I drink it.
what?
you don't wear your ring.
not at work.
you're separated.
is it that obvious?
marriage...
it's hard.
Yeah. Well...
I've got the scars to prove it.
speaking of which, you want to tell me about the ones you have, the one above your heart, for example?
ran into a sword.
a sword.
what about your shoulder?
bullet hole.
stomach?
shotgun blast.
arm?
gardening accident.
no, I didn't want to bore you. Another sword.
or more like a-- a dagger, really.
you walk away from a major M. I.
no sign of cardiac damage, you survive multiple shootings and stabbings...
you're either the luckiest man alive or the unluckiest.
well, that'll depend on whether you'll have dinner with me tonight.
I'm on a shift.
tomorrow night.
I try not to mix my personal and professional lives.
well, what happens when you fail?
I don't.
never?
talk about boring.
nice view.
kind of romantic.
Yeah, that's what I thought. Doctor.
now, that was flirting.
definitely flirting.
so what's with you and that doc?
she has a crush on me. She just doesn't know it.
Yeah, you're irresistible. Watch out!
you keep that up, you're gonna die young.
I have good karma.
I hate it when a victim doesn't die at the scene.
damn emts destroy the place.
if it was up to Santori, everyone would die at the precinct right next to his desk.
what are you staring at?
this park was originally called Lang Mesje.
dutch for long knife.
ironic, given the way she was killed.
and that's important why?
well, it was the name for a creek that ran through here.
the soil still has a sandy quality.
good for casting shoe prints like these.
now, we'll need to compare them with the emts' shoes.
I talked to the first officer on the scene.
he said the victim's clothes were almost entirely ripped off.
he said he's never seen so much blood.
what is it about women that scares men so much, they need to rape and kill to destroy it?
1813 Bronx
get away from me, coachman!
do I look like a horse to you?
no, sir.
no horse... or whore.
my kingdom for a whore!
nice...
did you miss me?
every second.
but you should go inside before you invite trouble.
durst is so drunk he'll fall asleep standing up.
will I see you tonight?
Oh, I'd be lost without you.
we can't have that.
now off with you.
I've always wondered, Mank, when you work on a female, do you ever think of her as a woman?
not really.
for the record, Santori, when I work with you, I don't really think of you as a man.
we got more info on Mary Worth. - She was a nun.
URSULINE order.
Really?
Oh, god, I'm going to hell.
how'd you know that?
she was a nun.
she was whispering something in the E. R.
I couldn't make it out.
it just came to me.
it was Latin. Salve Regina.
prayer to the virgin Mary. - Yeah.
how do you know the order? You're not a catholic.
jeopardy! Question.
the Ursulines have had residences in that area for a long time.
they came over from cork in 1812.
it was a lucky guess.
what do you have?
she has multiple puncture wounds, contusions on her arms and neck, probably from the struggle.
weapon?
serrated knife.
traces of semen.
and hair under her fingernails.
we'll send it all to the lab and run it for DNA.
she also had severe vaginal tearing.
I hope you find this guy.
who's there?
a ghost?
no.
it's my lucky day.
no.
they why'd you come here?
I don't know.
for comfort.
that's what I'm offering.
that's not what I meant.
what... what's happened, Fanny?
no one can know.
thank you.
just got off with special victims. No matches.
space cowboy.
he's done it before.
not in this city. - Check jersey.
you think he's a serial?
listen, we got a print here that doesn't match any of the paramedics.
deep imprint.
over 6 feet, maybe.
unique tread.
could be a specialized shoe.
Triple-e wide.
he's big boy.
maybe he's a diabetic.
they suffer from swollen feet.
how did you know?
what?
2 hits.
experience.
on our way.
another one. Uptown. This one's alive.
thank you.
NYPD.
can we see her?
she's pretty shaky.
we'll go slow.
do that.
she was a virgin.
you need a second? - No.
detective Rquez. This is detective Amsterdam.
why did they call you?
well, they're required to by law.
this is like a bad dream.
do you mind if we sit with you for a while?
no one can know about this. No one.
I was at a fashion shoot at 37th and 8th.
you're a model?
designer.
I caught a cab uptown.
the driver wanted to go through the park.
he pulled over, said there was a problem with the tire.
he asked me if I could help him.
when I came out to look, he grabbed me by the hair and pulled me into the park.
then what happened, Amartya?
he pushed me to the ground.
he smelled of oil. Patchouli oil.
I know the scent from India.
and he tore off my skirt.
and he did it.
he penetrated you?
he--he had this knife, and, uh...
I bit his hand...
and, uh...
he tried to cut me...
and I kneed him in the, you know.
and he screamed, and I rolled away.
and he chased me, um...
but it--it was dark.
and I hid in some trees.
and then... I came here.
is there anything you need?
anything we can do for you?
you're safe now.
really, I don't feel safe.
it's ok.
I'm here. I'm here.
who are you?
NYPD.
detectives Amsterdam and Marquez.
I'm Charvi Vikram, her sister.
thank you for coming, but this is a family issue.
I wish it was. But there are other victims out there.
he may have raped and killed a nun last night.
Amartya, could you give us a description?
he was tall, white...
Tall--how tall? Taller than me?
please leave her alone! She's been through so much tonight.
I want to go home.
did you notice the taxi number?
just 2 letters--x98.
that's enough. This can't become public.
she won't be pressing charges.
ms. Vikram, she's the only witness who can identify a serial rapist and murderer.
I'm sorry, I can't.
please leave!
Amartya, think of the next victim.
Johanna, don't forget the gooseberry jam.
Mr. Durst likes it on his scone.
you hungry, John? There's bacon.
Oh, not this morning.
have you seen Fanny?
she's been around.
do you notice anything different about her?
I wouldn't know.
does she seem sad?
she's a woman.
you know something you're not telling me.
it's better left as it is. - What is?
I know you've been stealing extra flour to feed your family, Catherine.
I don't think mr. Durst would like to hear that.
don't you know, John Durst's favorite sport is deflowering.
that's the only flour he cares about.
13 years ago, it was my turn.
now it's Fanny's.
what do you got?
cross-referenced the taxi medallion numbers with the special victims database.
got a hit.
the guy was popped 3 years ago for sexual assault.
the D. A. Declined to prosecute because the victim refused to cooperate.
Phillip Long. Lives in jersey.
tall. 6'3."
all systems go.
hold the elevator.
get out of!
head him off!
I cut her.
shoot him. - Shut up!
is that an army ranger knife, Phil?
tactical fixed blade, serrated edge?
man, I always wanted one of those.
I was in the rangers, you know. Whitcomb's rangers. It was a long time ago.
you probably never heard of them. - Shut up!
I'll kill her, I swear!
no, you won't, Phil. Come on.
you only kill women you've raped.
you're a diabetic, huh? That's tough.
everything swells up.
all this might just be a problem of low blood sugar.
go ahead, move.
I mean, you gotta be impressed.
the lengths I'll go to be in the same room as you.
there are other doctors.
you really think I got stabbed just to see you?
now, that's a little narcissistic.
I don't know what to think.
you're a very strange man.
you have no idea.
see how fast your blood clots?
I got back some more of your tests.
your platelet level is 10 times normal, and you have very low levels of factor 8.
I love it when you talk medical.
you have a nice laugh, Sara.
you should do it more often.
I told you I couldn't help you.
can we talk to you alone?
we caught the guy, Amartya.
but we need you to come down and identify him in a lineup.
with the DNA sample and the other physical evidence, the D. A. Said it's an open-and-shut case.
then why do you need me?
you're the sole witness.
would I have to testify?
you may. But...
it'll send him away for a long time.
what's the deal?
we're running an hour behind.
NYPD. Homicide.
I'm Ben Robinson. I'm shooting her collection.
you ok?
she told me.
hope you nail the bastard.
we have.
he should rot in prison.
we're working on it.
I told her she should take a pass on this collection.
she insisted on doing it.
it's better if I'm working.
you have our number.
think about what we said.
I know, Fanny.
he's ruined me.
he can't take from you what you haven't given.
he... he was drunk.
he was too strong. I tried to fight him.
did you?
how can you ask me that, John?
I've lost the only thing I care about.
your honor.
you. I saved myself for you.
are you sure he can't see us?
absolutely sure.
do you recognize any of these men?
number 3.
number 3, take 2 steps forward.
where do you know him from?
he's the man who raped me.
get him out of here.
he'll never touch you again.
he said he'd kill me if I told anyone.
John didn't tell me he had such a radiant new partner.
Oh, I don't think radiant would be the word he'd use.
how long have you known him?
seems like my whole life.
Really?
so what's the deal with him?
he's a great detective, don't get me wrong.
he's like a savant. But...
he's got this bizarre sense of humor.
this weird past lives thing, and he acts like he doesn't care if he gets killed.
Oh, he cares, believe me.
you should have seen her, Omar.
she took down this guy all by herself, single-footed.
I had it all under control, until you showed up.
there it is. You're famous. - Phillip Long, the alleged taxi rapist, who was apprehended earlier today, was freed this evening on bail.
charges have been reduced after the D. A. Admitted there was a problem with the DNA evidence.
Mr. Long's attorney accused the primary witness of being a publicity seeker.
an online gossip site has identified her as designer Amartya Vikram.
ms. Vikram refused any comment.
please, I just can't talk about this anymore. - You have every right to be upset.
they said my name on TV.
it's like a nightmare that keeps going on and on.
many years ago I had a friend.
she was more than a friend, she was--she was funny and decent, and then
a man she worked for raped her. Brutally.
I didn't understand. I didn't listen.
and what I did hurt her more.
all she needed was to feel-- feel safe, protected.
I didn't do that for her.
I'd like to do it for you.
haven't you done enough?
now everyone knows who she is.
the rapist knows. He's probably sent her a gift basket.
we can offer her police protection if she wants it.
we'll take care of her.
I told you, it's a family matter.
you have to eat, girl. - Why?
how are you, John?
how should he be?
he's drinking my wine.
you, Johanna. Fetch me a glass.
it's like silk.
reminds me of your mother's.
here's your wine.
watch yourself, coachman.
what's mine is mine.
Amsterdam. Yeah.
I'm glad you called.
I know just the place.
change.
it's very difficult.
before I went out on my own, I worked for the big houses.
when I finally started making money, I brought my family over.
they lived in a small town outside of Bangalore.
I rented a place for them on the upper Westside and...
they didn't like it. Too American. Too modern.
so, they moved to little India.
jackson heights. - Yes.
hey run a store with my sister.
my parents don't know much about what I do.
it's probably better that way.
it's a lovely name.
it means immortal.
ally?
I wish I felt that way today.
we'll get him, Amartya.
you can stay here until we can arrange more formal security.
omar will look after you.
is Charvi your only sibling?
I have 2 brothers and a younger sister.
but she died.
what about you? Are you married?
not presently, no.
but you have someone in mind.
Yes.
then you shouldn't wait.
in my religion, we believe in reincarnation, but I think the reason the soul keeps on traveling through time is to find its mate.
if you've found her, you should do everything not to lose her.
care for a ride, milady?
what are you doing?
following the advice of a very wise young woman.
you are a strange man.
do you even know how to drive this thing?
I've had some practice, yeah.
may I?
everything changes. That's the one constant.
all these houses were stables.
if we wanted to go to Washington square, we'd park the carriages here.
you talk about it like you were there.
was.
when the automobile replaced horses, they became artists' studios.
dreiser, O'neill, E.E. Cummings, they all lived around here.
I love E. E.Cummings.
for life's not a paragraph, and death I think is no parenthesis.
Yes.
good poet.
mean drunk.
do you believe in true love?
that's a big question.
Oh, it's the only question.
do you mean is there only one person in the world for each and every one of us?
couldn't have said it better.
total fairy tale.
made up by Madison avenue to sell cosmetics.
Really?
and by mothers to keep their daughters virtuous.
frankly, I've always felt sorry for women who've bought into that myth.
like I said, change is the only constant.
I need to get it.
yeah?
I'll be right there.
it's Amartya.
constable?
can I have a word?
you may have 2, if you're willing to pay twice as much.
it's a private matter.
in my job, all matters are public.
buy me a pint and I might consider it.
I'll do more than that.
proceed.
I work for Andrew Durst.
I accuse him of rape and assault.
are you the victim, then?
a maid. And others in his household.
durst should be put away. He's a savage.
but a wealthy one. How much are you offering?
all I have.
but not all I have.
the gentleman is innocent.
feel better?
no.
she wasn't a prisoner. She chose to go.
I shouldn't have left her.
he only went in the kitchen to make her some food.
when he came out, she was gone.
what could you have done?
do we know who called her?
we requested an emergency dump on her phone.
long must have followed her to Omar's and then waited for her to leave.
the stab wounds look different to me. - How?
no serrated edge, maybe a curved blade.
so he used a different knife. I mean, he had to.
we have the original weapon.
and there's no evidence of rape.
listen, we got a fix on long.
you want to pay him a visit?
you take it.
I'm gonna look into her photographer.
you were seeing Amartya.
did she tell you that?
well, I know she trusted you enough to tell you about the rape.
you called her last night.
it was on her cell records.
I left a message.
she never called back.
yet here you are, business as usual.
I didn't know what else to do.
work's the only thing keeping me sane.
we were engaged.
hadn't told anyone yet. - Why?
her family didn't approve.
I'm American. I'm a Jew.
her family's still living in the middle ages.
figure it out.
well, since you're here, we could use more wine.
get it yourself.
you can always tell where my coachman is...
by the smell of horse dung.
and you are a thief.
not likely. I have everything I need.
of honor.
women's honor.
you mean that whore Fanny.
she had no honor to lose.
and since you're hardly a gentleman, neither do you.
I demand satisfaction, if you are a gentleman.
you know that the one who is challenged chooses the place, the distance, and the weapon?
then do it.
pistols.
10 paces.
in the garden at dawn.
I accept.
take honor from me and my life is done.
honor.
a word we almost never hear anymore, 36.
not in America.
it used to mean virtue, nobility. Now...
it's become just another reason to kill.
maybe it was always that way.
do you have a warrant?
then get out of my store!
I'm looking for something special.
we're closed.
look, detective...
I'm sure you did what you thought was best, but my sister is dead, - and nothing you can do now will bring her back. - Tell me about your other sister.
she died a few years ago, before we came here.
how?
an accident.
I really don't want to talk about it.
it's painful, that kind of loss.
the thing is, I checked it out, in the Bangalore times.
it wasn't an accident.
she was murdered, wasn't she?
stabbed.
an honor killing.
you were the one who called them, aren't you?
I don't have to talk to you.
she trusted you, and that was her mistake.
she wasn't scared of the rapist, was she?
she was scared of her family.
if they found out she'd been raped, who knows what they'd do?
well, Amartya knew.
her sister Maya had already paid the price.
you have no proof.
you picked her up that night and took her to meet somebody.
somebody who had a-- a knife like this.
will you be next, Charvi?
you cannot understand!
your sister brought you here.
she supported you. She loved you.
she deserved so much better.
no second.
why am I not surprised?
I have no need to drag others into my affairs.
do you apologize?
you know the answer to that.
it's just as well.
your death will be apology enough.
long's copping a plea.
that's good.
we found another witness who I. D.'D him for the Mary Worth killings.
you ok?
Yeah.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
why you ask me here?
for torture?
we only do that to guilty people.
Charvi was very upset after you come.
she do not tell me what it is about.
Yes.
someone once said that...
to outlive your children is the worst tragedy.
no one can know.
no.
the reason I asked you here was to deliver some good news.
the man who raped your daughter has confessed.
I pray to Shiva for that.
he admitted to raping Amartya.
and killing her.
I hope this provides some comfort to your family.
Yes.
I wanted to tell you myself before it was splashed all over the news.
he say he kill her?
he also...
described the rape in detail.
unfortunately, that will also be in the papers.
bastard.
he'll get what he deserves.
he said he stabbed her, mr. Vikram.
over and over...
he said he raped her a second time before he killed her.
he's an animal.
he rape her again? No.
it--it cannot be.
I know this is difficult to hear.
no. No. She was not raped again.
how do you know that? - I know.
were you there?
good shot. Not perfect, but...good.
now it's my turn.
Mr. Vikram, you have the right to remain silent.
I do not want to be silent.
this man, he tried to steal what is mine.
I only do what I must for my family. - You killed her.
Yes.
I, uh, I consider this matter settled.
but I don't.
I love my daughter. She understand.
this is our way.
as a man, I do what I must.
as you did to your other daughter.
you do not know.
how can you?
your world, it is not my world.
now, look...
I have money. I can open doors for you.
where I live...
without honor there is no life.
there is nothing.
you have nothing that I want.
come on.
we'll have to pick up Charvi.
she's a co-conspirator.
you knew he wanted to confess.
he wanted to let everyone know what he'd done.
that's the point of honor killings.
it should be called something else.
murdering women for falling in love with someone different.
leaving an abusive marriage.
or... getting raped.
there's no honor in that.
what is it about women that scares us so much?
there's one waiting for you.
why don't you ask her?
let's go.
I can come with you. - No.
I killed a gentleman. They'll come after me.
it wouldn't be safe for you. - I don't care.
I do.
I did you a great wrong, Fanny.
I--I failed you when you needed me most.
he'll never lay a hand on you again.
what will happen to me now?
if you care for me at all, Fanny, you will live to a ripe old age.
you will marry, you'll have many children, and you'll be happy.
I've waited a very long time for this.
I call it home.
romance.
glamour.
excitement.
this city has it all.
when you've lived here as long as I have, you've seen what I've seen, cynicism isn't just a pose.
it's what gets you through the day.
and I've had a lot of days.
and a lot of nights.
the opening step, El Paseo, the stroll.
so who are you, John?
I hardly know anything about you.
ask me anything you want.
does a cop learn how to dance the tango?
detective.
detective.
a milonga in buenos aires.
the abrazo, the embrace.
John: Some of us came here for love.
some for treasure.
most of us came for a new beginning, and brought our old ways with us.
No!
we don't kill women.
get out of the way!
come on, 36, come on.
life was cheap in new Amsterdam.
it still is.
and homicide, I've seen people kill for a pair of shoes.
Hey, 36.
what happened?
problems with your bookie?
I fell.
again?
looks like you were pushed.
there was a slight disagreement over funds.
I'll cover it.
I'll build something. A desk.
Hey, I owe you that much.
I remember when the Lonious Monk bought one of your desks.
Ah, 1957, after the midnight show at five spot, with Coltrane sitting here.
Trane died mad at me.
you deserved it.
poker or mets?
damn mets!
Omar, you never learn.
best invention-- indoor plumbing.
worst invention-- the alarm clock.
my name is John, and I'm an alcoholic.
all: Hi, John.
I haven't had a drink in 15, 495 days.
Hey, guy, do you think that's funny?
I can do the math.
you'd have to have been sober since 1965.
I look young for my age.
John: The more things change...
the more they stay the same.
man: Cansu get in there?
do you know who she is?
no id.
nice body.
could be a pros. - Unlikely.
well, four were killed in this area in the last year.
spell that perfume?
pick that up from Cosmo?
she that lesbian comic?
how come I'm not shocked?
actress, turn of the century.
was her favorite scent.
what does that have to do with the price of tea in shanghai?
heliotrope, 250 an ounce.
not what your typical working girl wears around here.
I'm detective Eva Marquez.
we're gonna be working together.
are we?
that's what the lieutenant says.
you Eddie Marquez's kid?
I worked with him in the 4-4.
he's a real putz.
worked with your brother in Bronx narcotics a couple of years ago.
he's a putz, too.
hope it's not genetic.
as a matter of fact, it is.
you deserve each other.
so what do we got on this?
dead girl. We try to find out who did it.
funny. Does she have a name?
I guess not.
when I got this assignment, I asked around about you.
you know what I heard?
make sure your insurance is paid up.
dust this. - Right away.
no sign of forced entry.
could be someone she knew.
neighbors hear or see anything?
no, everybody's deaf, dumb and blind.
I'll go talk to them.
look, detective whatever-your-name-is, here's the way it goes
first week, you make an effort. Second week, you hate my guts.
third week, you put in for a transfer.
so why don't you just save yourself some time- - and miss the foreplay?
no way.
my name is Eva.
excuse me.
don't do this, man. I don't want to have to shoot you. - Then don't.
it hurts like hell.
I didn't kill her, ok? - Yeah?
Where'd the blood come from?
what's her name, Eddie?
get on the ground, now!
I know how to use this thing.
last time I was shot, it was with a Hopkins and Allen, XL number 6 pocket.
now, get on the ground!
now, those days, bullets didn't have copper jackets, so it was like pouring hot water through your veins.
are you crazy?
woman: I'm a doctor.
he's still asystole.
one more time. - Ok, clear.
what you done to me?
you will not grow old.
you will not die...
until you find the one, and your souls are wed.
OK. Let's call it.
what's the time?
John: Trust me-- all of it gets old.
John: Except me.
how long have we known each other?
long enough to know better.
you know the answer. Why do you ask me that?
do I look different to you?
you could use a shave.
look closer.
you look, uh...
happy.
I almost died.
Hey, let the good times roll.
my heart exploded chasing some guy on the subway.
but that can't happen, not to you.
there's always a first time.
Oh, boy.
I think she was there.
who? - The one.
the one who'll make me old like you.
I never did like that idea.
you meet your true love and then die.
doesn't sound too romantic to me.
how do you know she was there?
well, the shaman told me I'd feel it here, in my heart.
well, maybe the shaman was wrong.
maybe it was just last night's chinese.
you don't know. It ain't exactly science.
this was like nothing I've ever felt!
look, you just had a heart attack and didn't die.
now, I thought when you met the right one, you were supposed to become mortal
only after our souls are united.
what the hell does that mean?
after you kissed her, after you slept with her?
after you've done lamaze class- - they didn't give an instruction manual, ok?
I didn't exactly meet her.
I was too busy trying to breathe.
so you don't even know who she is.
I know she was there.
I know she exists.
that's enough. - Not for you.
you're gonna try to find her.
and when you don't find her, you're gonna get crazy.
and last time you got crazy, it was a long damn 10 years.
I know this is hard for you.
no, I'm happy for you, man.
inside, I'm doing the camel walk.
but this is a good thing.
I've been waiting centuries for this.
if I can find her, it'll all have value.
time... will have value.
Oh, dr. Dillane.
Hey, uh, we have a problem?
we, or you?
remember that M. I.You brought in yesterday? - Yeah.
the one with the scars. Did you ever get his name?
no, but that's not it.
um, he's disappeared.
he was dead.
Yeah, I know.
like I said, we have a problem.
John: You're in my chair.
probably because I'm sitting at your desk.
I can see we already progressed to the next stage of our relationship.
I don't hate you, Amsterdam.
that would take too much effort.
good. Today's a whole new day.
missing persons?
fingerprints, crime scene reports.
it's called police work.
someone needs to do it.
she's not a missing person.
how do you know that?
her boyfriend told me.
we had a little heart to heart in the subway.
his name's Eddie Riley.
Yeah, he's a primary subject. When'd you bring him in?
I didn't.
he give you her name?
he had a train to catch.
look, don't be cute. She deserves better.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
where you going?
police work.
someone needs to do it.
look, we need to set some ground rules here.
you sound just like my last 609 girlfriends.
I hate that smell.
if dead bodies make you queasy, what are you doing in homicide?
wasn't my choice.
I wanted to work undercover narcotics, but the powers that be refused my application.
and dead bodies don't make me queasy.
I just can't stand the smell of formaldehyde, ok?
Coroner: She have a name?
John: Yeah, we just don't know it.
well, the bullet perforated the right brachio-cophalic vein and the internal thoracic artery.
what caliber?
maybe a . 38, close range.
she has some random contusions, defensive marks.
I also found what looks like paint underneath her fingernails.
sent it over to the lab.
see if it matches anything over at the S. O.C.
- Any chance the body was moved?
lividity is inconclusive.
I'm sorry. I have a new baby.
you need a deep male voice.
try putting on npr at 10: 00.
cool. Baby sleeps, and brushes up on foreign affairs. I like that.
then there's this.
the penmar.
an underground club.
you knew about this how?
it used to be a speakeasy during prohibition.
same name, same spot.
NYPD.
we're trying to id a young woman.
she had the club stamp on her wrist.
lots of girls come in here.
any that look like this?
what happened to her?
that's what we want to know.
hold on a sec.
you knew about this being a speakeasy, how?
I used to drink here.
I think your dead girl is like some wannabe celebutant.
she's the one.
shaman: In all of time, there is only one person you were meant to be with.
we feel this.
we know it.
but we do not know how to find the one.
supposed to be closed. - It is.
and you're naked.
right again.
surveillance from Chloe's bank.
she withdrew 10k from her account the morning she was murdered.
that's the guy I chased.
Santori's put a wan card out on him.
she also deposited a check for the same amount from a pawn broker 6 days ago.
only question is...
what is she selling?
great thing about New York-- pawn shops are open all night.
why narcotics?
most cops would kill to get into homicide.
it's after the fact.
digging through the past isn't going to bring anyone back.
I'd rather be on the front lines.
why homicide?
I like to solve puzzles.
and it intrigues me.
what does?
death.
likes to play hard to get.
I'll see you tomorrow.
you have a good energy about you, Eva.
it's true.
I felt I should say something nice.
so there it is.
best Yankee pitcher in history, Guidry.
Gossage, the goose.
guidry won a Cy Young Award. 25 and 3 in '78.
what do you know about it?
I know his curve ball dropped like it fell off a table.
all you could do is wave at it.
Hey, lone ranger, you know that guy you let get away?
before he went into the army, he was no stranger to the system.
G. L.A.Burglary, assault.
not murder. You want to up your clearance rate until we nail the right guy.
if they're innocent, they don't run.
Riley's our boy.
and when I find him, he won't get away.
he's right, you know.
all signs point to Eddie.
he could have shot me. He didn't.
I saw it in his eyes, he's not a killer.
What'd you find?
pawn shop keeps a photo log.
this is what Chloe sold, vintage, deco-style, platinum and diamonds.
bezel and bead-set stones.
could be 4. 5 carats.
you learn that from one of your 609 girlfriends?
one of my wives.
plural.
how many have you had?
only one at a time.
no way Eddie gave her this.
I'd like to know who did.
Hello?
Mrs. Carlton?
I'm detective Amsterdam, this is detective Marquez.
we're sorry about your loss.
get out. Please.
we know how hard this must be for you.
you know nothing. You're a child.
I have work to do.
we need your help, Mrs. Carlton.
we need it now, because I'm not letting whoever did this walk away.
will that bring her back?
she was my heart.
you have no idea what I'm feeling.
it's just words until it's happened to you.
he was 6, my son.
well, almost 6.
it's pain without end.
do you know who gave Chloe this bracelet?
she ran with a rich crowd.
dated Toby Hardwick for a while.
as in Hardwick hotels?
never liked him much.
a rich boy through and through.
broke up a couple months ago.
any idea why?
she'd met someone new.
she said they had something real.
and now she's gone.
how do I go on?
Thanks.
right here.
Mr. Hardwick?
excuse me a moment.
Hi, you must be detectives...
Amsterdam and Marquez.
pleasure. Let's step over here for a mome.
thanks for coming out here.
we have preliminary inspections all week.
another hotel?
low-cost housing for 300 families.
with dreams comes responsibilities.
so, how can I help you?
Chloe was a good friend of our family.
we haven't been able to contact your son.
Toby? He's on a skiing trip.
he'll be back for the funeral.
how long has he been gone?
a couple of days. Why?
he's not a...suspect, is he?
what can you tell us about your son's relationship with Chloe?
they went out for a while.
nothing very serious, I don't think.
who would have given her a $10, 000 diamond bracelet?
I don't know.
that's a lot of money.
I suppose my son is very spoiled, my fault.
we work to give them everything, and then they don't know what to do with it.
look, Toby may be many things, some of them not very attractive, but he is not a killer.
madagascar red, manufactured in Italy until the 1940s.
this is what was found under the victim's fingernails.
Artist-grade paint, banned for its toxic lead content.
but what's revealing is the medium used.
the artist added water-washed linseed oil laced with gold leaf.
gold leaf?
it was a marker.
an artist's unique signature.
can you date it?
based on the molecular deterioration, I would say 1930s.
so if Chloe scratched a painting before she died, then she probably wasn't killed at Eddie's.
no madagascar red there.
that means the body was moved, maybe by Eddie.
or someone who wanted to frame him.
that painting could be anywhere.
it's gonna be a very cold trail.
not if you know the painter.
my mother seldom worked on canvass.
she was more known for her onsite murals.
she painted them all over New York
private homes, hotels, libraries.
they called her one of the first graffiti artists.
the paint really does shimmer.
that is what made her work unique, she mixed it with gold.
did she keep any records?
she was an artist, not a bookkeeper.
but you could try asking her.
I thought your mother passed away.
no, she's still here.
sometimes, that is.
the alzheimer's plays havoc.
Hello, Julianne.
I wanted to ask you about your work.
you've seen it.
Oh, many times.
you used a pigment called Madagascar red.
did I?
I remember alizarin crimson, such a lovely color.
what about Madagascar red?
it's--it's so long ago.
it might have been for a special commission.
please, Julianne.
it's important.
Yes.
for the lover's sacrifice.
I painted that mural, you know.
I know, I know.
where did you paint it, Julianne?
they won't let me take walks anymore.
they...
they're worried I'll forget my way home.
sometimes it's better to forget.
but you remember your work, don't you?
do I know you?
not anymore.
she painted the mural in the presidential suite of the Davenshire hotel.
sold in the eighties to Hardwick hotels.
Toby Hardwick had access, but motive?
we need evidence.
we have to get into that suite.
I'll get a warrant.
you think I wouldn't remember you?
you think I wouldn't remember what we had? - I'm so sorry. This happens sometimes.
it's ok. Let her be.
one day you left.
you just left.
I gave up so much for you.
didn't I mean anything?
the thing of it is, I knew you were going to leave me.
I knew it the first day we met.
ever ask yourself why a vampire has no reflection in a mirror?
not this week.
it'd be too painful.
to see himself year after year, century after century, unchanged while everything around him grows old.
to search for love but know it's always just out of your reach.
because to be human is to die.
to die is what makes life worth living.
it's god's joke.
what about the girl in the subway?
there were probably a couple hundred women on that platform.
maybe she was the one, maybe not.
maybe she was on her way to the airport and is long gone.
it's all maybes.
maybe it's a sign that I'll never find her.
your desk is done.
newly painted.
the killer's standing here.
there's a struggle, he hits her, she falls against the wall here.
shouldn't we wait for crime scene?
Absolutely.
got the blood work back on your disappearing corpse, and it's a mess.
no, this must be a lab error.
these numbers don't make sense.
I mean, the hemoglobin level's over the moon.
120 micros of lead?
that's enough to kill someone.
Yeah, and check out the blood type. It's this rare form of RZRZ.
it became extinct when rtain native american tribes disappeared.
so, somebody's pulling our chain?
hope so.
OK, but how did Toby remove the body?
I mean, there must be security cameras everywhere.
you know...
this guy kind of looks like you.
you think?
what the hell?
it was common for turn of the century hotels to build secret entrances to their best suite.
Toby could have known about this.
took a chance.
that's years of bad luck.
only 7.
let's bring him in.
No!
OK. Ok, there's no way I reserved that room.
you're name's on the register, you've partied there before. Come on, toby!
I don't care, I wasn't there.
there's no way that you can prove that I was.
that's enough.
counselor.
Mr. Hardwick is my client.
I suggest that if you intend to charge him, you do so.
otherwise he's leaving with me.
I don't need someone to talk for me. I'm not 5 years old.
be quiet, Toby.
look, there's no way I could have killed Chloe.
she's my friend.
you were jealous because she met someone else.
Yes, I love her, but not like that.
well, then how?
you don't strike me as the Platonic type.
my father's here, isn't he?
is he--is he watching?
what if I could prove that I wasn't at the hotel that night?
you don't need to say anything.
I'm in love with someone else.
I was with that person the night that Chloe was killed.
yeah? We need her name.
I can't do that.
you can if it's true.
OK.
his name is Brian Shaw.
I guess we all have secrets.
that's what keeps us in business.
what do you think his father's saying to him?
he's telling him he loves him.
Aw, a romantic.
I can read lips.
and you're also deaf, I suppose.
it was temporary.
Normandy.
a shell exploded too close to comfort.
sorry I asked.
talked to Toby Hardwick's boyfriend and verified his alibi.
I told you, Eddie riley's our guy.
don't take it too hard, hotshot.
even red ruffing lost a few.
I just heard from Mcmanus.
he found Eddie at the Penmar.
turns out his brother-in-law runs the place.
he's been hiding out there.
Santori's on his way to pick him up.
get in.
what happened?
tried to run.
guess he thought it worked once, it'd work again. It didn't.
he'll be all right.
found this on him-- a . 38.
nice work, Tony.
brought this one home.
I've been doing this a long time.
you got good instincts, john, but sometimes things are what they seem.
Thanks.
that's a good lesson.
you didn't buy a word of that.
not true.
he said I have good instincts.
what do your instincts tell you now?
same as before.
Eddie didn't kill that girl.
but if he's innocent, why did he run?
why didn't he give himself up?
he comes home, finds Chloe's body.
he tries to save her, gets blood all over him.
the cops show up.
he knows what it'll look like.
he has a record, body's in his place.
now, who's gonna believe him?
so he picks up the gun and runs.
then who did it?
the only other person with access to the suite, the only person who would have known about the secret entrance.
interesting theory, but it would help to have a motive.
it's more than a theory.
Hardwick was having an affair with Chloe.
how do you know that?
his son implicated him.
when? I was there, I didn't hear him say that.
I didn't say I heard him.
I'm not sure lip reading's exactly admissible.
Hey, Eddie.
you're the dude who chased me.
I thought you were dead.
I was.
now I'm not.
lucky me. I don't want to face another murder charge.
I don't think you killed her, Eddie.
I think you loved her.
you ever been in love?
I've loved.
I'm talking about something else.
I'm talking about feeling like you're drowning when she's not there.
did you ever feel that?
no.
well, that's what we had.
you know who killed her, Eddie.
but you don't trust the system.
you think the game's rigged, right?
Yeah, well, I'm here, aren't I?
well, too bad you won't have the chance to do something about it.
doctor said you're well enough to be transferred to central booking.
put on your pants.
Hey, spare 2 bucks?
talk about inflation. Sorry, buddy.
how about 3 bucks?
keys.
you don't want to do this.
shut up! Cuffs and car.
come on, come on, come on.
been a while since we did something like this.
it feels good.
OK, let's see where he takes us.
what are you doing?
what do you want?
do you know who I am? - Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
you're Eddie, Eddie Riley. - Yeah?
Eddie, listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. - That's right.
I'm a very rich man. I can do things for you.
what can you do for me? Can you bring Chloe back?
Eddie-- - shut up!
Eddie, please. Please, can we just talk? - Shut up! Shut up!
get down on your knees! - Ok, ok.
get down on your knees!
please, I'll give you anything you want.
what are you gonna give me? What?
like the bracelet that you gave her?
she hated it! She hated it!
it was a handcuff.
admit it.
look at me! Admit it.
I want to hear you say it.
I swear it was an accident.
she said she was gonna leave me.
and then things just got out of control. I'm sorry.
so you shot her, and you dumped her body in my apartment like she was trash?
it just went off. Eddie, please.
put it down.
the gun's empty.
it's over.
no one gets to die today.
thought you were gonna wait for me.
Yeah, I lied.
you--you didn't have to come.
actually, I did.
I, uh, thought you might want this.
you asked before how you go on.
you do what you can.
you go to work, you see your friends, you cook food, get up in the morning.
and one day, it changes.
don't know why, it just does.
it's definitely an original Benwaar.
and in impeccable shape.
may I ask where you found it?
goodwill.
then you're the luckiest man alive.
tell that to my bookie.
how's 15, 000?
when I heard about this Benwaar fellow,
I did a little research on him on the internet.
his last desk sold at auction for 87, 000.
I could go to 60.
done.
thing about great art, it's timeless.
it's as if the artist was speaking to us today.
smoke?
Oh, I'll pass.
sure?
it's afzal molasses tobacco infused with peach resin.
that stuff will kill you.
McManus told me what happened to your last partner.
said you had a death wish.
Really?
if we're gonna be working together, we have to trust each other.
you don't need to worry about that.
you won't be here long.
your application to narcotics wasn't denied.
your father buried it.
he wanted to protect you.
you can reapply in 3 months. - I will.
and you'll get in.
but why?
who are you trying to impress?
only you, Amsterdam.
you don't need to.
how did you find out about this stuff?
it's what we do.
we bring closure to people who need it.
you seem to need it.
closure.
it's what we all want.
you will not grow old.
you will not die...
until you find the one and your souls are wed.
how will I know when I find her?
you will feel it, here...
in your heart.
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Uh, yeah. Sorry.
going to Williamsburg. North 6th and Wythe.
do you mind? I'll just hang onto you.
can you just drop me off at Williamsburg Bridge?
that's fine because I'm headed into the Bowery. Do you mind?
all right, that's fine. We'll just split a fare.
two stops. Yeah. Chamber Street.
just take the FDR No, no, not FDR Drive.
not Chamber Street. No. Oh, my God. If you take FDR Drive, first of all, it's more of a fare. I do this every single day.
it's an extra 20 minutes. I got to be somewhere.
take the FDR Drive, please. It's a lot faster.
I think we can hang down the West Side Highway and make a left on Chamber Street.
there's no point, though. There's going to be
Bleecker, guys. We're going Bleecker.
no, we both want to go to the same area.
Bleecker's going to take an extra hour.
Bleecker Street is totally out of the direction. That's ridiculous.
both of you, out of the cab.
wait a second. Calm down, man.
we're not going to get out. We'll share the same rate. We're not going to Bleecker.
out of my cab.
Hey, sweetheart. How you doing? It's me.
I'm doing good. Thinking of you. Hey.
Yeah, I dreamt about you last night.
I'm ready for you. Had my Wheaties.
I miss you, too.
you ready?
okay. I got some surprises.
whoa. Magnifique.
pardon. Excusez-moi, mademoiselle.
this yours?
um, it is. It must have fallen out of my bag.
it was on the floor near the bathroom.
that was really nice of you. How can I thank you?
I wouldn't mind if you bought me a drink.
great. What would you like?
whatever you're having. Two gin and tonics, no ice.
losing your cell phone's like losing your mind.
do you come here a lot?
I do. A lot. Too much.
long story.
tell me.
I've got a ton of time.
I only saw my dad once in my whole life, right here.
when my mom was pregnant with me, she never told him.
just left him.
growing up, she had a lot of boyfriends.
went through one after another.
always left them.
every time she'd leave a man, though, she'd keep something, like a souvenir.
maybe a book or a necklace or a painting.
when she left my dad, she kept me.
I was her souvenir.
before she died, she gave me a piece of paper with his name and number on it.
I called him up, and we met here.
I said one thing to him.
what did you say?
dad.
that's it?
I'm a gift for you, from Mom.
thank you.
I walk past your flower room every day.
I see you, but I say nothing.
I'm so afraid to look at you. Oh, girl.
you say I'm the strongest. I say you're the kindest.
you ask me where I'm going. I point to the ocean.
Oh, girl.
very touching.
lyrics to this song.
let me have a cigarette.
Indian? I think it's Japanese.
chinese. Chinese?
xie xie.
incroyable.
which means "Thank you, I fuck, and you're off-key."
he found my phone for me.
Really? Very nice. Thank you.
Gary. Nice to meet you.
Ben.
how are you, Benjamin?
just Ben.
thank you.
nice to meet you.
I'll leave you two alone.
have a seat. Sit.
sit down.
we know each other?
it's possible.
you look familiar.
new York's not such a big place.
you study? NYU?
I wish.
I teach there.
am I a good teacher?
you're a good teacher. Thank you.
so what do you do?
thief.
could be. That is funny.
might be? Used to be?
will be?
to be or not to be. Well, I'm a thief.
I've been trying to steal you from your wife, but it hasn't worked so far.
can I get the bill?
you lost your wallet?
you lost your wallet.
is this yours?
Wow.
Yeah, that's my wallet.
Merci beaucoup. Money's gone.
I recently lost my wallet, but I managed to get my money back.
a young man should never be without cash.
knock yourself out, young man.
you lost your wallet?
did you lose my pictures, too?
pictures? How could I?
how did you get these?
I took these, like, five minutes ago.
aren't you full of surprises today.
you took off your ring.
Ben, your keys.
Mm.
Ben, wait up!
I've come into the city only to do this deal, so it better be good.
my customer wants natts, ASAP.
I'm in the middle of my wedding arrangements, but I came here to do this business with you.
who are you getting married to?
his name's Chaim.
chaim in the mood For love
Where's my invitation for your wedding?
did you invite me to your wedding?
Oh, I wish I had.
25 years I've been trading with Hasidic people.
I know nothing about them. They know nothing about Jain peoples.
strictly business. We don't come to 47th Street to chitchat.
while you inspect the goods, I'm going to eat.
excuse me. Hmm?
you can't eat meat, right? You Hindus?
no, we are not Hindus. We are Jains.
hinduism is too materialistic for us.
no meat, no fish.
and what can't you eat? No pig, no shrimp.
what else can't you eat? No onion, no garlic.
no milk and meat together. No potato, no roots.
nothing that hasn't been blessed. Nothing too spicy.
it is exciting the passions, you know.
the Christians-- they eat everything.
they're like the Chinese.
they never have to spend too much time picking a restaurant.
that's why there are no Christians in the diamond market.
how can you trust a person who will eat anything?
this parcel's not so good.
at least 20% rejection you've given me.
how much?
too much. Way too much.
I'll give you 480.
why are you doing this to me?
my children will be crying at home because after I do business with you, I have no money for food.
I can't make commission on this.
maybe I can give my children some dry bread.
I have to check with my customer.
my customer says too much.
no, he doesn't.
I know you understand Gujarati.
that's why I lied.
and I know you know I know Gujarati.
and I know you know Yiddish.
I was speaking to an answering machine.
520, as a wedding present. Mazel.
I'm sorry. I can't shake your hand.
I'm not allowed to touch any man who isn't my husband.
Mazel.
and mazel for your wedding.
mazel for the dozen children you'll soon have.
thank you. Is that your children?
Minesh and Paresh.
Where's your wife? Oh, she's not looking that good in the photographs these days.
oi.
last year she decided that marriage was a sin.
now she's in India, with her head shaved, going door to door, collecting food in the bowl.
she used to be my wife.
now I have to worship her.
don't worry. She's not the only one without hair.
I had to shave off all mine this morning 'cause I'm getting married tomorrow.
this is a wig.
Why? What is so wrong with women's hair anyway?
why you all want to cut it off?
they wanted me to cut it off on my wedding night.
I said "No way." Yeah?
it took 25 years to grow, 10 minutes to cut off.
and now, for the rest of my life,
I have to wear some other woman's hair.
for all I know, you could be wearing my wife's hair right now.
what do you mean, your wife's hair?
most human hair in America comes from our temples in India, where women offer their long locks to God so that they can be sold to the West and you can have your wigs.
while we are waiting for the Messiah, while we are waiting for Mahavir...
your eyes will suffice to give tired men hope.
this is not the proper etiquette in this neighborhood.
what is this?
Rifka!
Rifka!
Mansukhbai!
Ah, oui? Ah, oui.
Oh, I'm so I'm so sorry.
wow, that's an entrance.
wait. Which way are you going?
uh, I was just gonna go over cross town to the East Side.
Oh, I guess I can film there, too. Okay, let's go.
thank you so much.
you're welcome.
Hello?
David? Are you okay?
did I wake you? Yeah.
Yeah, you can say that.
listen, he left me a message about a couple of music cues.
who?
Abara, your director.
uh, okay, which ones?
5, 7, 8, 12, 13
okay. Okay, great. What was the message?
he hates them.
you have to change them.
because?
he didn't say.
Oh, well, what do you think, Camille?
maybe you should talk to him directly.
Mmm. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll call him.
Hey, Camille. It's your favorite stalker.
did you talk to Abara? Yeah, we talked.
he talked for, like, two hours about, like, composers
Wagner, Brahms, Gustav Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Dostoyevsky.
that killed me.
Dostoyevsky isn't a composer.
are you okay? Never better.
great. Well, I need your address.
Abara wants to messenger you something right away.
does he?
hold on.
Aw. It's on my phone.
I'm a total idiot when it comes to numbers and addresses.
my last girlfriend... Uh-huh?
I couldn't remember her birthday.
she broke up with me because of that.
Yeah, well, you deserved it.
probably. But the upside is that I'm single now.
so, dinner?
you're sleep deprived, David.
no. I'm Camille deprived.
I'm thinking Balthazar for dinner and maybe a little pastis for dessert.
I'm thinking unemployment if you don't finish those cues on time.
give me your address.
Hello?
Hey, did you get the books?
I left them outside your door.
wait. What You were here? Why didn't you call?
I knocked, like, a hundred times.
what the hell is this?
he talked to you about Dostoyevsky.
please read.
is this guy crazy? Am I
am I supposed to read these or eat them?
okay, David. I'm gonna put you through to Abara, okay?
you can talk to him.
how'd it go with Abara?
he just said "Read the books, Dave.
don't use CliffNotes or Wikipedia.
just read them." So fine.
I'm on a bench in Central Park with The Brothers Karamazov.
800 pages, and I'm page 22.
Ouch.
bless you.
Thanks.
what? What's wrong?
I can see the Dakota. Hmm.
John Lennon...is my god.
you know his song "Mother"? Yeah.
I was a kid the first time I heard that.
why can't I write a song like "Mother"?
Oh, I just sent you a picture.
Oh, my God.
is that John Lennon standing behind you?
what? I'm just kidding.
I have no idea what you look like, Camille.
hmm.
send me a picture.
no. No way.
is that what you look like?
if you're calling for Camille, please leave a message after the beep.
there are 1, 784 pages, and it takes me four minutes to read one page.
1, 784 pages times four minutes a page is 7, 136 minutes, which equals 118. 9333 hours, which comes to 4. 955 days.
but you can round it off to five days without sleeping.
it's impossible. I quit.
I quit.
goodbye, Camille.
Hello?
[Ring]
please leave a message after the beep.
Hey, David. It's Camille.
you know, when Dostoyevsky was writing The Gambler, he signed a contract with his publisher saying that he would finish it in 26 days.
and he did it, but he had the help of this young stenographer.
this girl she stayed with him, and she helped him.
and afterwards, they actually got married.
isn't that cool?
that's how he met his wife.
anyway, I found this story in the preface for Crime and Punishment.
so I was thinking that
and this would have to be between you and me.
but I was thinking that I could read the books and tell you what's going on.
that way, you could just focus on your music.
but only if you're comfortable with this.
and if you're not, you know, we can just forget it, and you can quit.
but if you are, then open this door.
Open...this door?
okay, a deal's a deal.
does this mean we're getting married?
I have a lot of reading to do.
Hi. I'm Camille.
Hi. I'm David.
Hello?
where?
thank you.
that was kind of a powerful, intimate situation.
what was intimate?
just now. Just We...
sharing the flame.
I mean, that was that was intimate.
if you say so.
Oh, come on now.
you know what I'm talking about.
our hands almost touched.
I looked at you, and you lifted your head up slowly, and our eyes met.
it was It was It was intense, and it was intimate.
Wow. Stop it. I feel naked.
Yeah, well, you know what? I have that effect on women.
I mean, not all women. No, not all women.
but it has happened before, so don't be alarmed.
Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Don't ignore what's happening here.
we're having some kind of powerful, weird alchemy, and you have to pay attention when that happens.
this stuff is not to be treated lightly.
listen, I actually just came out here to have a cigarette, okay?
and relax and do my thing. Okay. No. Sure. Sure. Yeah.
so, uh, maybe another time.
Yeah. But there may not be another time. Okay?
I may never get this chance again.
I mean, we may never, you know, be able to return to this- this moment.
well, then, you should know that I'm married and happy.
right. Uh-huh. And where is he?
huh? Huh?
he leaves you out here alone, in the dark, without a light.
I'm not feeling that. Well, he doesn't smoke, so
but you love him anyway. Yeah. Why not?
sure. Sure. He just abandons you, huh, to your mortal disease, and leaves you alone to suffer and die, when he's in there pretending to love you?
I don't respect this guy. I think he's a coward.
I think he's selfish. And forgive me for saying this, but I think any moment now, this guy's gonna open up his real self to you, and it's gonna be all like, scary stuff's gonna come out.
you know, I felt it right away.
I felt it right away that I think
I'm gonna say something a little bold here.
but I think you might be married to the wrong person.
I don't know that even if that were true that I'd tell you. Right.
we're not exactly friends. No, we're not.
no. That's true.
but we did share a flame. Right?
speaking of. Oh.
see? Look at that. See? You need me.
you're walking away, and you need me.
we share a flame. Thousands of tiny molecules are heating up right now.
they're penetrating our brain.
they're stimulating our sexual desire.
I don't know about you, but I find that shit very romantic.
and I'm so glad you walked over here because now I can feel a little bit more comfortable to tell you that I happen to be, uh, on the forefront of men able to find and locate a woman's G-spot.
and I could do that for you.
that's really generous of you. Thank you.
it's my pleasure. Well, it's your pleasure.
and what makes you think I haven't located it yet?
um, the way you hold the cigarette.
it's a little high and tight, you know?
what you have to do is you have to lower it.
you have to bring it all the way down in there so it just sits comfortably.
it rests there. If it's high and tight like that, the whole body gets restricted, and the plexus gets closed off, you know, and the vagina gets locked.
look, I just happen to know this crazy, weird technique with the vagina.
it's kind of cool, and I thought you'd be interested.
but you have to be prepared.
you know what I mean? Preparation is the key.
I mean, it starts with a little walk. Just a short walk, like...
you know, like, to, uh like my apartment.
it's a couple blocks from here. And we would walk, and I would tell you a few little elegant, classy jokes.
you know, kind of getting us a little giggly, a little silly.
you know? And then we'd share a glass of Burgundy. Burgundy?
Yeah.
we'd bask in the warm, gentle, romantic yet erotic glow of, uh, my spacious loft.
and then I would undress you, and you would undress me.
we'd stand naked before each other, and we'd kiss.
I find- I find kissing a very helpful, sweet way to- to relax.
and then, maybe I would I would
I would bite your neck a little bit.
not- Not hard. Just gentle gentle little nibbles, like- like a little kitty cat, you know?
and then And then you would feel my hands kind of descend to your lower region, kind of, uh, finding their way, massaging the skin around your clitoris, which would even stimulate the arousal even more.
all the time, I'm whispering delicate little poems in your ear, you know?
and the blood from your body is- is rushing to the wet internal walls, and my fingers would slide effortlessly
are you an actor or something?
or a comedian? You're a comedian.
no. I, uh I'm kind of a writer.
Oh, you're kind of a writer. Yeah, kind of.
you know, what about you? What do you do?
I'm a hooker.
what exactly does that mean?
that exactly means that people pay to have sex with me.
Mm-hmm.
so, if I wanted to, um...
here's my card.
it's got my number and my Web site on it.
so wow. You're, uh...
that's why you're Fridays is no good.
Saturdays and Sunday are busy.
weekends are... Avoid weekends.
you know, I look forward to hearing from you and sharing another... intimate moment.
well, fuck me.
in New York City, there are currently 759 drugstores and over 1, 600 registered pharmacists.
on the day of my senior prom, one of them would change my life.
shit bums. They lose 2 to 1 again. One run.
they couldn't hit a ball with an oar. Listen, this is on the house.
I heard about what happened with you and that girl you were dating.
Oh. I'm really sorry.
and on prom night.
like there's gonna be other proms.
well, there's not gonna be another prom.
not now, not ever.
she's a whore, all right? Crushing a young man's dreams.
she's a snake fucking devil whore is what she is.
she's got no right. It's- It's really It's all right.
I mean, we only went out a couple months, and I'm okay with it.
here's the thing. I'm gonna help you.
come here for a second.
I got something to show you.
that's my daughter. She'll go to the prom with you tonight.
it's the right thing to do.
and that's not chopped liver, right?
Nuh-uh.
I was 17, and I'd only been to second base, but I felt like tonight could be my lucky night.
Hey, kid.
Hey, Mr. Riccoli. Hey.
call me Frank. Oh. Yeah.
you look good. Thanks.
Oh. Hey.
listen, try to get her home by 12: 00, 12: 30.
she's gotta take her pills.
why are you stopping?
that's my girlfriend.
Hey.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I came with Gil.
he's a film major at NYU.
Oh, that- that's cool.
we're- We're cool. Whatever.
it's no biggie, you know?
how's your, uh, swimmer's ear?
good. Better.
who's your date?
make-a-wish.
Yeah. Yeah.
you know, it was her dream to go to prom, and I said, "Of course I'll make your dream come true.
I want to dance.
uh, we should we should talk first.
I want to dance.
everybody clap your hands.
check it out, y'all.
how low can you go?
can you go down low?
all the way to the floor?
how low can you go?
can you bring it to the top?
like you'll never, never stop?
wait! That's my limo!
you've got your own wheels.
want to walk me home through the park?
through the park?
Thanks.
I had a really good time tonight.
me, too.
I should probably take you home.
make a wish.
I really can't think of anything right now.
come on.
take my panties off.
come on.
Yeah, that's them.
okay, now take your pants off.
hurry.
come on.
come here.
grab my legs.
that's it.
Mmm, it's morning.
Oh, fuck!
motherfuckers. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
they lose it in the 9th these rat bastards.
they lost it 8 to 7. 8 to 7.
them Yankees need some pitching. Hi, Daddy.
Hi, baby.
listen, I, uh- I really want to thank you very much.
there are not too many young men like you left in this city.
well, it's my pleasure.
Yeah, New York actresses they drive you nuts.
actresses?
last year, she played Helen Keller.
she walked around the city for two weeks, blindfolded.
you know, to get the feeling of the part.
broke her nose twice. Now she's doing this thing downtown what the fuck Whose Life is it Anyway?
anyway-- Anyway, she's doing 20 hours a day in a chair now.
central Park covers almost 843 acres.
it is 6% of Manhattan.
there are also 127, 000 Method actresses in New York, which is 2% of the population.
and on the night of my senior prom, these two elements came together to make one perfect wish come true.
God, I love New York.
and here I am The only living boy in New York
all right, guys. I'm done.
I'm out. Yeah.
Thanks, man.
Hey. Hey.
you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
that was nothing.
you know what?
give me a sec, all right? Just gonna go say bye.
my man. All right.
that's for you.
now, with a little bit more practice...
I ain't practicing.
you had me going. Hey.
you're good.
yeah? Yeah.
all right. Let's go.
I don't know why I said I'd meet him.
I know I gave him my number, but when?
when we said goodbye?
Oh, yeah. It was at the bar.
I didn't realize we were gonna go home together at that point.
idiot.
why did I do that?
why did I act like that?
I'm only gonna have two drinks tonight.
I'm not gonna have sex with him. I don't want to.
I really don't.
God, I had no intention of going home with him or anyone.
when he sat down next to me, it was so clear we weren't each other's style that it wasn't even weird.
and since there was no vibe, we just started talking without thinking anything, and then I don't know what happened.
[Man, thinking] It's a bad idea with this girl.
what am I saying? She's not a girl.
I have no idea how old she is, but she's not a fucking girl.
why am I walking 30 blocks to this bar?
I'm not in a good space for this.
Yeah, she was beautiful. Yes, she had a great body, and she's smart.
was she even drunk? I don't even know.
I don't even know what she was. Does it really matter?
Ow. Am I imagining things, or is my dick itching?
no, no, no. It's just these pants.
they always rub me the wrong way.
God, that was sexy.
it was beyond sexy.
I felt like I was in a damn Bertolucci movie.
what is wrong with me? Why am I so fucking nervous?
this is ridiculous. Let's just get in a cab.
no, you're too early. Shit! I need a cigarette.
I don't think I was drunk.
although I definitely had red wine teeth when I came home.
I'm sure he found that really attractive as I sat at the bar yammering about myself.
Oh, no wonder he was so excited when we got home.
I finally shut the fuck up.
Yeah.
I hardly said a word the rest of the night after that.
it was good, but there's nowhere for it to go.
I think it would've been fine if it was just sex, but it took another turn.
something happened. I don't know what zone that was, but both of us played into it.
it's good we're gonna do this have a couple of drinks and get straight.
let him know I know what this was nothing.
God, I hate that window.
I don't want to see the innards of the subway system.
makes me feel sick.
just get me there.
Hi. Can I get a Jameson? Great.
here you go. Thanks.
you left that on.
Yeah. I'll look at it later.
Madame.
thank you.
this is not the room I wanted.
I don't find it comfortable so near to the street.
the noise.
I can carry my bags.
that is my job.
this is good.
I was hoping it would snow.
then the street is quiet.
the world goes quiet.
I don't think there is snow.
you're not American. No.
no, we're not so many of us American in this hotel.
it's one of the things I love best about New York.
everyone came from somewhere else.
Yeah.
well, I hope you will be very comfortable here.
please call down if you need anything.
there are no flowers.
is it possible to have flowers in the room?
violets? Or...
I love violets.
I'm not expecting you to buy them, of course, if you, uh if you don't have them.
I'm sure I can find some violets.
come in.
how did you do that?
I didn't do anything.
you must have requested them.
they were downstairs in lobby.
I didn't.
all the better.
incredible.
so you're lucky, no?
these violets were waiting for you.
are there any other miracles I can perform?
Oh, I doubt it.
what- What's happened?
here, here.
Oh.
I'm s- I'm sorry. Here, here, here.
no, no. Come on.
put your head back.
are you in pain?
it's not my business. Fr
from your back?
wait here.
I have something for you.
please?
the mystery of the violets is solved.
my father is, um
my father is manager here at hotel.
he's very happy you have returned to hotel.
he's very big admirer of yours, madame.
he says he heard you sing many times in Paris.
please thank him.
Paris is place I wish I visit.
would you like me to open?
perhaps.
would you join me?
I don't...
please?
Sant?
you seem so sad.
no one so young should be so sad.
do you still sing?
hmm?
never. Mmm.
I'm sorry.
I should love to have heard you sing.
Mmm.
you are too cold.
surely.
no?
how can you bear it?
don't know how you can bear it.
I'm sorry. I I don't see anything.
did you see something in the street?
would you like me to close the window, madame?
it is very cold.
Yes.
please close the window.
the manager is very happy that you've returned to the hotel.
he remembered your love of violets and hopes you enjoyed them.
he's a great admirer of yours, madame.
says that he heard you sing many times in Paris.
Yes.
please thank him.
artist?
painter.
I see the paint on your hands.
Mm-hmm.
I'm a painter, too.
already there's been some serious interest, you know?
people like my stuff.
I mean, they really like it.
you've been here long?
it's not easy here.
I see things everywhere. Don't you?
it's all new.
on the walls, on bridges,
I see things.
I get my palette from the sky.
I wait, and I paint.
don't you think, when you first come here, you come because this is the capital of everything possible?
Ah, for a while, it can be.
I can make the buildings dance.
whole cities move because of me.
it's how you look at things, Teya.
you see a city between the buildings.
Mm-hmm.
you see the shapes they cut out in the sky?
Mm-hmm, like Mommy's teeth.
Oops.
that's okay.
my umbrella's out of control.
it's everywhere.
you like that dog? Imagine if we were in a huge umbrella, if we were living in a huge umbrella.
that would be so weird, because then we're going to see a green or any color all the time.
Why's that squirrel chasing the other squirrel?
because he loves her.
then why is she running away?
because she's scared.
hmm. Can we go to the fountain now?
the fountain? I don't remember where the fountain is.
do you?
Oh, no! Oh, no!
mommy doesn't let me eat hot dogs.
you want sushi?
Seaweed's gross.
then it's our secret, okay?
all right.
bracelet fell in.
excuse me.
yeah?
we couldn't help but notice how good you are with her.
Oh, thanks. Thank you.
it's so unusual to meet a manny.
and a good manny, at that.
what?
you know, a male nanny.
well, thank you. Thanks.
excuse me. Teya.
Tey. Come, baby.
let's go now.
time to go. Come.
the sun's a boy, and the moon's a girl.
exactly, Tey.
el sol, la luna.
la luna. Yeah, that's right.
I like when they're both out. Yeah?
they make all these pretty colors, and it's kind of like purple, hot pink and regular pink, and they sort of, like, play tag with each other while they still can.
Hey, sweetness.
Hey, Mommy.
Hi.
nice outfit.
did you pick that out yourself?
Yep. And the bracelet matches.
it does.
Ed's over there. He's got a snack for you.
no, thanks.
you're going to get hungry.
Nuh-uh. I had a hot dog.
you need to be firm with her, okay?
she needs the discipline.
she needs you.
she misses you.
um...
pick her up again tomorrow?
okay.
okay.
come on, monkey.
daddy, Daddy!
excuse me. All this for dry cleaning?
Yeah. Is tomorrow okay?
why not?
after 5: 00.
you've been shopping.
very expensive stuff.
I don't like to run out.
your Cantonese is improving.
I've been studying.
have a nice night.
25
Hey, how are you today?
good.
I want to paint you.
you know, portrait.
um, would you like Come with me?
why me?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I can't.
please.
okay. I'm sorry.
I'm going to give you my address.
if you change your mind...
I'm waiting for you.
Hey. You looking for something?
I looking for the painter.
what?
the painter.
the painter is dead.
you want apartment?
can I help you?
Oh, thank you.
you're welcome.
well, I guess this is useless.
aren't you the one who's always filming in the coffee shop?
I thought I was being more discreet.
I guess my secret's out now.
if you ask for permission, you never get it, so...
so you like to break the rules, then?
a lot of people give me trouble.
well, I will be the exception for today.
Oh. City's full of surprises, right?
Yeah.
Hey, it's me. Can we talk?
Yeah, Peter. How are you?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I'll get it to you in the morning.
no, they're very important clients.
no. Losing a client is not an option.
shit.
Yeah.
And?
thank you.
no, I don't care. Tell him to postpone the opening.
Yeah, yeah, of course.
and if their lawyer tries to contact you...
what do you see?
no, don't mention the second offer.
not yet.
no. Okay, Peter.
you, too. Thanks.
you know, this is what I've always liked about New York
these little moments on the sidewalk, smoking, thinking about your life.
makes you appreciate the city better.
you can watch the buildings. You can feel the air and look at the people.
sometimes meet somebody you feel like you can talk to.
you can talk about what?
things you can say to a stranger.
you know, when there's no past, there's no guilt.
have you ever made love to a perfect stranger?
now you're teasing me.
I believe I am.
well, I mean...
no, not exactly a perfect stranger, if you mean someone I wouldn't know at all.
it's sad.
it's sad? Why?
because there's almost nothing more exciting than fucking somebody you don't know.
right?
you don't know their name, barely saw their face.
don't.
don't tell me your name.
you know what? As soon as I finish this cigarette,
I have to walk back into that restaurant and sit down again in front of my husband.
And?
and he won't look at me.
and he won't notice I'm not wearing a bra under my dress.
no bra?
no panties, either.
Oh.
no underwear?
not today.
I feel sad for this poor, lonely husband who can't see his wife's hidden talents.
don't you think he's like every man, though?
he's typically blind and bored by his very own wife, ready to fantasize about the first unknown woman he hasn't fucked yet.
am I bothering you?
not at all.
Yeah. And you say that because now I've turned you on, right?
you want to take me to bed.
do you want to take me to bed?
Yeah, I probably do.
Aw, come on. All right, why are you telling me all of this?
because tonight I want things to change.
chain smoking's a bad thing.
who knows? Maybe we'll meet again.
thank you.
enjoy your meal.
I love you.
I love you, too.
okay?
a heart that's full up Like a landfill A job that slowly kills you Bruises that won't heal
what the hell happened to you?
I was doing downward dog, and then I went into chakrasana, and that's when it happened.
what's a downward dog?
yoga.
Oh, yeah. You know,
I remember you used to be really loose and limber.
Mr. Riccoli, can you just fill the prescriptions now?
I didn't mean loose like I know what you're saying.
I just have somewhere to be.
right.
um...
what the hell Who you with?
birth control? What the hell are you doing?
Oh, come on.
no, listen, I'm just saying that, you know, I think, Lydia, personally it's time for you to have babies.
what are you, kidding me?
what's wrong with you? I'm out of here.
What'd I say?
what did I
you used to be nice. What happened to you?
whoa.
Hey, Lydia, come on. Talk to me. What'd I say?
Hey, I'm sorry.
what the hell did I say?
babies.
you're picking on me again.
I just don't understand why I'm always the one who has to initiate everything.
not true.
we don't go anywhere.
you don't take me anywhere.
I took you to the park last week.
come on. I'm talking about outside of the city.
name one place in the past two years outside the city that you've taken me to.
beach in the Hamptons.
that's where we met, and you hated the Hamptons.
I'm talking about a road trip, or a canoe trip, even. A bike trip.
will you stop with the phone?
just name one.
exactly.
what?
if you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?
you know where.
come with me. What are you doing?
I just bought tickets. We're leaving now.
we are?
are you out of your mind?
I don't have anything with me right now.
well, I will buy you a toothbrush.
in Rome.
coach is fine.
lift your feet.
you don't lift your feet.
I'm lifting my feet.
no, you're shuffling.
the doctor said you should lift your feet.
I'm lifting, I'm lifting.
you want you should fall down, break your other hip?
at least then the pain would be the same on both sides.
equal. Everything always has to be equal with you.
I'm a democratic sort of fellow.
well, see how democratic you feel when you fall down and break your other hip.
I'm not breaking any hips.
is there some place you got to get to later?
what is your hurry?
my hurry is I want to get there before next week.
at the rate you walk...
you want faster?
divorce me and get yourself a younger man.
Tom Cruise, perhaps.
you think you're funny?
I do, as a matter of fact.
then what would you do, Mr. Smarty-pants?
Mr. I'm so independent,
I don't need any help opening the pickle jar.
I got caught in a pickle.
you'd still be putting on your jacket if it wasn't for me.
go ahead, hit me, why don't you?
want to run me down?
all the time, honking like they own the place.
we could have driven.
who could have driven? You?
you're going to give me a heart attack now?
what's the good of having a car if I never get to drive it?
you can't drive. You can't even read the street sign.
I still have my license.
only because that girl at the DMV took pity on you.
all that flirting with her, oh.
it was embarrassing.
Brighton Beach Avenue.
as if you didn't know what street this was.
I know what street this is. Of course you know what street this is.
you think I don't know what street this is? Did I say you didn't?
I was reading the street sign.
a regular Evelyn Wood I married.
hurry up, it's green.
the light's going to change.
step up.
okay.
you sure? We're not in any rush.
I said I'm okay.
don't walk so fast.
I don't want to have to call an ambulance.
I don't want to think about trying to make that cell phone she sent us work.
did you call her?
she called me.
what did she say? What do you think she said?
how are you? How is Dad? What are you doing?
and what did you say to her?
I told her we're doing the same thing we do every year.
good.
she said she sent us a card, and did we get it.
did we get a card? Did you see any card?
maybe it just didn't get here yet.
she probably sent it late.
don't criticize. I'm not criticizing.
you are criticizing.
I'm just saying, she probably forgot and then remembered at the last minute.
you wait and see.
the postmark will be yesterday, as if it could get here from France in one day.
where are you going?
I don't want to take the ramp.
well, the ramp is easier.
I'll take the stairs.
you're going to kill me.
today of all days, he decides he'll finally kill me
do away with me by making me take the stairs.
give me a heart attack, just watching you take the stairs.
they have smart police these days, like the cute one on CSI.
they'll figure it out.
it'll make headlines
man kills wife on 63rd anniversary, walking up stairs.
Hey, hey!
hoodlums!
they ought to arrest them.
let's go have lunch.
let's go. Come on.
let's go.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
lift your feet.
I'm lifting. No, you're shuffling.
lift your feet. Lift. I'm lifting, I'm lifting.
all right. Come on.
I fixed your hat a little bit.
you're looking okay with your hat.
Yeah.
looking pretty good-looking to me.
look at me.
look at me.
I look terrible.
must be. You are Tad. I know what you look like.
nice to meet you, Mr. Futch. - Henry, for God's sake.
please, come in. - Thank you.
Rosie'll be down in a minute. - OK, great.
may I offer you a chocolate martini?
wow, look at that. - I hear they're very big out your way.
yeah? Yeah, I guess they are.
I'm driving, so...
Attaboy.
[Mr. Futch] Have a seat.
so, it looks like Emperor's New Clothes will top $100 mill in domestic BO.
Yeah.
and Quantum Studios, I think they're looking to vertically integrate, either by buying a web or a weblet.
could be.
Yes. Yeah.
Hey. - Hi.
I see you've met Dad. - Yeah. We've been talking shop.
so what do you want to do tonight?
do you guys have a movie theater? - The Warner.
it's part of the Loews family of theaters.
have you seen King Arthur of Britain? - I've been wanting to.
you two enjoy yourselves.
have her back by dawn. And no cocaine.
no, sir.
[Whispers] How was I? - You were great, Daddy.
good night. - Bye-bye.
I'm telling you, that's him. - Oh, yeah.
mom, I swear it's him. - You think so?
Yes, it's Tad Hamilton.
you look so sad there.
[Tad] Give me a break. I'd just lost my wife and my goat.
[TV] Next week, on a very special Paramedic Rescue...
and what were your respective ages?
I was 12 and she was 30. - Did your mother know?
[Man] Yeah.
Ahora disponsible en viernes in super mercado.
[Tad] So, what do people do at this point in the evening in Fraziers Bottom?
well, they go to the diner. - We could do that.
we haven't eaten anything in almost, what, 15 minutes.
or they go home. - It is a school night.
of course, if it were a date, we might go to the Watergap Overlook.
and what do people do there?
they park.
and then?
and then they marvel at what a feat of engineering the gap is.
but this isn't a date. We can't do that.
no. - No.
I don't want to do anything to harm the friendship.
me neither.
over two trillion tons of water pass through the gap every hour.
that's enough water to float a battleship.
or put out every fire in West Virginia.
no kidding. - Uh-oh.
excuse me.
[Chuckles] Huh.
hello. - Hi, Mr. Futch. It's Pete.
Hiya, Pete. Rosie's not here.
she's out with Tad Hamilton.
Really? I hadn't... OK, cool. Good for her, then.
he seems like a very nice guy.
he does. A lovely, lovely guy.
so, like, where did they go?
the movies. - The movies. OK.
it looks like the seven o'clock would get out at 8. 45, 8. 50...
or so someone happened to just mention to me in passing.
so I guess that would put them out and about and onto their next activity.
I guess it would, Pete. I'll leave Rosie a note that you called.
Yeah, I just had a little inventory question.
a little dairy-case query.
but we can clear that up tomorrow.
OK, Pete. Goodbye.
all right.
Rosie...
could I see your driver's license and regis...
Yikes-a-bee. - Hello, Officer.
Rosalee? - Hi, Tom.
Hi. Wow.
Oh, boy. - OK, then.
we heard you were in town, Mr. Hamilton.
did you? - Pretty fond of our Rosalee there, huh?
Yes. Yes, I am, Officer.
Tom? - Right, right, listen.
we got a call saying that there was someone parked here and you know it's illegal after sunset, so...
you got a call at this hour? - Yeah.
from who, a raccoon?
never mind.
[Rosie] I am going to kill Pete, bring him back to life and then kill him again.
[Tad] Calm down. Calm down.
why aren't you upset? - Because it doesn't matter.
OK?
what happened here tonight was a force of nature.
two people set out to be friends, but nature would have none of it.
nature wanted them to be more.
and nature is going to want that tomorrow.
what did I tell you?
what did I tell you about your carnal treasure?
you said to guard it. - I said, guard it.
and what did you do? You practically chucked it at him.
you're acting like it was a sleazy night. It wasn't. It was classy.
it's not like he took you to the movies and then felt you up in his car.
the evening evolved, Pete.
my God, did he actually say that?
it started as two friends going to the movies...
and it evolved into dry humping. - He fought it.
he didn't want to do anything that might wreck the friendship.
Wow. Did he actually... I can't believe he used that line.
and I can't believe you bought it. - It's not a line.
OK, fellas, a show of hands. Who here has used some form of the "don't want to harm the friendship" line?
father Newell? - Well, prior to my enfrockment.
Rosie, what are Tad's pectorals like to the touch?
are they warm yet firm like...
Cath, that's really not helping now. - Sorry, got caught up.
Thanks. Listen, Rosie, just...
listen to me, bottom line.
tad Hamilton is an actor, OK?
how do you know that he's not acting with you?
he's not acting. - No.
he is. He's playing a role.
the role of Hollywood bad boy trying to find virtue.
OK, after you guys have...
after you guys have been together a couple of times he's out of here, OK?
you will never see him again.
Hey, Rosie, guess what? I bought a house.
I bought a house. Can you believe it? Can you believe it?
it's actually a farm with a house and a silo for my wheat.
Really? You bought a house. - I bought a house.
we're putting down roots, baby.
what do you think of that? - It's good.
come see it. Maybe after work?
I'd love to. - Yeah, I'd love to.
great.
[Rosie] He's going to stay in the motel while he fixes up the farm.
he's a farmer all of a sudden? - [Rosie] I think he'll be a good farmer.
[Pete] He's from Malibu, California.
the only thing they grow there are breasts.
[Rosie] Could you smile a little bit?
this means nothing. - You are unbelievable.
what? Rosie, people like this buy houses all the time.
it's called a tax shelter. - Peter.
I can guarantee you that by the end of today
tad's farm and his house and his fricking wheat will be right back on the market.
Why? What are you going to do?
nothing. You know, just be a good neighbor.
Howdy.
tad, this place is unbelievable. - Thanks, little lady.
this barn sits on what they call "the south 40.
Yeah. I'm not sure exactly how many acres that is, but
I'm going to guess that's a lot.
I'm going to guess 40.
Oh, yeah. Could be.
tad, being a new farm owner and all,
I know you'll probably get some people to run this place for you, but...
hell, I'd be happy to show you a couple of everyday farm chores.
Really? Pete, that would be great. Thank you.
tad, that's not a problem.
what you're going to do here is grab on to one of the...
essentially one of the nipples, and just pull it firmly but gently towards the pail.
you're going to freak out a...
[Tad] Mmm, look at all that creamy milk. That a girl, Arleen. That a girl.
you are making old Tad thirsty. - [Pete] Where'd you learn to do that?
Pete, you remember my remake of The Grapes of Wrath?
[Pete] OK, so, the trick is to take a full swing so as to split the log in one swift...
stroke.
OK.
Yeah. Let's do this.
so, you work out?
no. - [Pete] Yeah, me neither.
I know, it's like... Me neither.
OK. It's just basically one swift stroke.
OK. And sometimes, basically, you get a bad piece of wood. Basically.
and sometimes you don't.
[Pete] That's good. Beginner's luck. First time's the charm.
and the luck continues. That's great for you, man.
did you ever see a movie I did called A Man Named Jackson?
if it came out, Tad, then I saw it.
I think the ax is actually broken.
you got it. Good.
[Tad] Get someone else to cry, because I don't cry.
I don't do that.
which is why I try to stay away from melodramas.
Oh, my God. I finally did it.
people, are you watching this? Rosie.
# But you may want to stay Could I seal your fate # You didn't kill me # 'Cause I can speak free So how many times do I # Have to tell you # How many times do I have to make it obvious to you # So you will do # What you're supposed to # Tell me now #
Pete. - Hey, Tad.
Hey. - Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
forgive the intrusion, but... - No, no. Please, fire away.
OK. Here it is.
you win, OK? Fair and square.
you win. - Thank you.
you did have an advantage or two going in, but...
excuse me, we're in the middle of something here.
Yeah, no problem.
I want Rosie to be happy.
so, I got to ask you a couple of questions.
do you know how long she keeps her hair in straight or in curly mode?
what?
or why her favorite necklace has a starfish clasp?
no.
do you even know that she has six different smiles?
she has six smiles? - Yeah.
one when something flat out makes her laugh.
one when she's laughing out of politeness.
but there's one when she makes plans.
one when she makes fun of herself.
one when she's uncomfortable. And one when...
one when she's talking about her friends.
I don't know those things yet, Pete. - No, you don't, Tad.
I'm telling you, she is more of...
a treasure than you can possibly know.
she's not just some wholesome small-town girl, some good-for-you breath of fresh air.
tad, she is a wonderful person with a huge heart.
Yeah.
and the kind of beauty that a guy only sees once, you know? Once.
listen, Tad, if there is even a chance that you could break her heart, please, just, for her sake...
walk away, man.
I could never break Rosalee's heart. OK?
good. Because if you do, I swear to God,
I will tear you to pieces with my bare hands.
or vicious rhetoric.
you're a good guy, Pete.
but it's apparently not good enough.
do you mind if I... - Yeah, no. My bad.
finish up in here. I'm sorry.
you're a good kisser.
but I guess it doesn't come as a shock to you to hear that.
you're a really good kisser.
even compared to Hollywood girls? - Mm-hmm.
that's just ridiculous.
[Driven Levy] Oh, Tad Hamilton.
[Shameless Levy] Your favorite people are here.
you got to be kidding me. - Who is it?
[Shameless] Guess who? - It's my agent and my manager.
[Driven] Taddy? Tadala.
this is a nightmare. - [Shameless] Housekeeping.
[Driven] Let us in.
[Shameless] Hey, Tad. - I'd like to apologize for...
[Shameless] Open zee zleibenshlocken.
[Driven] Come on. You're not going to be Punk'd.
fellas. - Tad Edward Hamilton.
howdy, little lady. - Hi.
my manager, Richard Levy and my agent, Richard Levy.
you're both named Richard Levy?
who isn't?
you.
you must be Rosalee. - Yes.
did we come at a bad time? - I hope so.
actually, yes.
[Driven] Well, Tad. Jimmy Ing stopped breathing.
what? - You got the part, pal.
seems he saw something that reminded him that he had to have you.
it was the body of your work. - I knew it.
your credits. The reality of you and who you are.
he called me and said, "Who am I kidding?
tad Hamilton has to play this part.
there's nobody else.
fellas, I have never felt better than I do at this moment.
[Driven] Except for that weekend in Cabo.
[Tad] That is exactly what I am talking about.
easy, I've got a bad back.
that's exactly what I'm talking about.
I told you a little good career news would put your head back on straight.
so then you're leaving? - Yes.
fittings Monday and rehearsals Tuesday.
you're back on the beam, pally.
boy, things happen fast.
Oh, my God.
you're right. - No, it's fine.
I'm going to turn it down. - What?
what? - You are?
I came here vowing to change my priorities and at the first opportunity I'm abandoning that.
you're not going to turn down the part. We both know that.
give us a minute, will you, fellas? - We'll be in the lobby.
I wonder if they have a masseuse on staff.
I want you to go with me. - What?
what? - She absolutely cannot go with him.
I won't take the part unless you come me.
although we could work something out.
Really? - Yes, really.
Rosie, have you been listening to anything I've been telling you?
I love you.
how many times in your life have you said that?
not counting the movies? - Not counting.
I've said it a few times.
but...
but I never knew what it meant.
I can't go with you, Tad.
because you don't love me.
you maybe want to love me, but I think what you love right now is the idea of me.
you can't love someone for what they stand for or seem to be.
you have to love them for their details, for the things that are true of them and only them.
I do love you for your details, Rosie. - You don't.
you couldn't possibly. You don't even know what they are.
you have six smiles. - What?
you have six smiles. Did you know that?
one when something really makes you laugh.
and one when you're just laughing out of politeness.
one when you're making plans and one when you're making fun of yourself.
one when you're uncomfortable and one when...
one when you're talking about your friends.
how many is that? - Like 50.
I told you. I told you.
that is so much better than any speech from any of your movies.
I had a better writer.
so...
will you go?
Yes.
he's going back to Cali, to Cali, to Cali.
[Tad] What are you thinking? - Nothing. I'm done thinking.
if I'm making a huge mistake, I don't want to know.
you're not making a mistake.
you know, as a bartender you do learn to kind of recognize those customers who need to talk.
Angelica, I'm fine.
but could I have, like, six more of these?
no, Pete. You really need to talk.
OK.
I think that our friend Rosie...
might be falling in love with Tad Hamilton.
Yeah, didn't have to be a bartender to see that one coming.
right, but the problem with that is...
that I'm in love with Rosie.
you know, I always thought that maybe you were.
so how much do you love her?
is it love, is it big love or is it great love?
what do you mean?
love you get over in two months.
big love, two years.
and great love...
yeah? - Great love changes your life.
Oh, my God.
it's great love.
isn't that great?
you got to win her back.
Angelica, trust me, I have tried everything.
what did she say when you told her that you love her?
well, actually, maybe not everything, but...
what did she say when you kissed her?
OK, maybe it's more like two things I haven't tried.
well, what have you tried?
I have very unsubtly implied how I feel about her.
OK, get up. - What?
get your ass off the barstool. - Angelica.
Hey, if you feel it and you don't do everything in your power to reach for it you are basically slapping life in the face.
I hate to break it to you, but I don't stand a chance here, OK?
as my father told me when I said I'd never get that job in a bar:
honey, your odds go up when you file an application.
sure, but I'm up against...
tad Hamilton.
you are Tad Hamilton.
what? - Don't you see?
everybody's Tad Hamilton to somebody, Pete.
rosalee's Tad Hamilton to you.
and you're Tad Hamilton to me.
Angelica, thank you.
so start acting like it.
OK.
Yeah, OK.
you are a really good bartender.
Hi. - Hey.
come in, come in.
I have something to talk to you about.
me, too. - Really? You go first.
no, you go first. - No.
seriously, you go first. - OK.
tad got a part in this huge movie and he asked me to go with him to California for the shoot.
we leave tomorrow afternoon. Isn't that great?
I probably should've gone first.
Why? What were you going to say?
it's nothing. It was nothing.
just, you know, travel safely, OK?
and just really enjoy the shoot.
actually, no, I remember what I was going to say.
I love you, Rosie.
I always have.
if I've been a jerk this last week, it's because I have been fighting.
I have been fighting for you.
I don't want to lose you to Tad Hamilton or anyone else.
you're the one.
so, any reaction to any of this?
because now would be an excellent time.
now? You kiss me now?
you say this to me now, after 22 years of being my friend?
Yes, to all questions.
I'm...
I have to pack.
you're telling me that you can't answer the most important question I'll ever ask in my entire life because you have to pack?
not only do I have to pack, but I have a load of whites in the dryer, and my dad called my relatives from San Clemente and they're expecting me, so...
it's all in the works.
but this is...
Rosie, what's in your heart?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
you OK, Pete? - Yes, sir.
listen, Pete, obviously we've all been a little seduced by Tad Hamilton's presence.
no one more so than me.
but that doesn't mean I don't know who cares about my daughter the most and who she would be with if the world were fair.
well, it's not. - No. No, it's not.
when I was your age I was completely in love with Eleanor Hershey.
of the chocolate Hersheys?
the Hershey chocolates?
she was a great girl, completely unpretentious.
I actually met her filling her Cadillac up with gas.
anyway, there was this French guy. He was really rich.
he owned, like, France.
I didn't stand a chance.
it happens that way sometimes. It shouldn't, but it does.
sometimes Goliath kicks the shit out of David.
it's just nobody bothers to tell that story.
well, thanks, Mr. Futch.
I feel much better now.
goodbye, Mr. Futch. - Take it easy, Pete.
are you sure you know what you're doing?
no.
ever feel more confused or alone?
no.
have a nice flight.
[Mr. Futch] So, we'll see you after principal photography.
Yes, Daddy.
you guys don't mind not flying with us? We need our privacy.
that's fine. - Yeah.
we look forward to our shit-ass commercial flight.
[Shameless] I always wanted a layover in Cincinnati.
we will be absolutely fine. - Another one in Chicago.
so we'll be in LA by April?
we'll be fine.
it's time. - OK.
safe trip, Tad. - Bye, honey.
welcome aboard, Mr. Hamilton. - Bye.
miss? - Thank you.
stop it. Stop it. What's the matter with you?
[Driven] Come on. Commercial isn't so bad.
[Shameless] There's got to be room for one more.
[Driven] Will you pull yourself together?
thank you.
would you like a Vicodin?
[Tad] Jimmy, being in your movie is a privilege.
in fact, it's more than a privilege. It's a real privilege.
can I... Do you mind if I call you back in a few minutes?
OK, thank you, sir.
you OK? - Mm-hmm.
I'm just a little nervous for some reason.
I have a little nervous feeling in my... self.
but that's only natural, right? - Yeah.
this is a pretty huge thing I'm doing.
kind of a great leap of faith.
but I have that faith in you.
so I'm fine. It's going to be great.
good. - Can't you tell by my smile?
which one is it?
what? - What number smile is it?
it's...
wait, it was one.
no, one was when something really made me laugh.
right? - One and a half.
Rosie...
I didn't know about your six smiles. Pete told me about them.
he made me swear I wasn't going to break your heart, or he would tear me to pieces, either with his bare hands or his rhetoric.
I stole the speech from Pete to get you to come here with me.
I lied. And I'm sorry.
and I know you're going to be very upset. I just...
Pete told you about the six smiles? - Yeah.
and made you swear that you wouldn't break my heart?
or he'd tear you to pieces, with either his bare hands or his rhetoric?
Yeah.
that is just so...
adorable.
what?
do you think it's possible to love someone your whole life and never really realize it until something happens that makes you see?
what's that from? - No, it's not from anything.
I'm just saying it to you.
Wow.
man, what a week.
fell in love for the first time, got my heart broken for the first time, was honorable for the first time.
got bit in the ass for being honorable for the first time.
bought a farm.
I'm sorry about the broken-heart part.
do you think you could take me home now?
Yeah.
thank you.
Cathy. - Rosie?
Where's Pete? - He's not here. What are you doing?
what do you mean? He's always here. He's Pete.
no. He didn't come in today.
can I borrow your car?
Yes.
thank you.
# Call it wrong # Call it reckless # See what we've gone and done #
Pete. Pete.
not Pete.
Wow.
I'm just here because Pete asked me to box up some stuff.
Why? Where's he going? - Richmond.
and he isn't going.
he's gone.
he's gone to Richmond?
Why?
I cannot believe I am taking my work home with me.
when great love is rejected, Rosalee, something inside a man dies.
so all he can do is run away, where he can meet the girl he'll love second most.
unless... - Unless what?
unless you can get to him before he closes the book on you.
but once it's closed, it's closed.
it's finished. It's gone, dead.
it's crushed. It's beaten. It's buried.
it is lost for all of time in a sea...
Angelica. - OK, yeah.
I owe you.
go.
# I will not be beaten # I will not be beaten # You have yet to see me shining # Shining # I won't take these lines out # You're gonna lose her # To another guy #
[announcer] If you've been dumped, give us a call on late-night talk.
let's go to line one. Scott, you're on...
# There's a million little things I'm going to miss #
what? Pass me.
Pete. Pete.
are you OK? - Yeah. No...
no, I meant to do that.
you have five smiles, Pete.
one when you think someone's an idiot.
one when you think someone's really an idiot.
one when you're getting all dressed up.
one when you're singing Barry White.
and one...
when you're looking at me.

Cassandra, my asset. She helped me topple ovechkin.
this is my son, Max.
micheal is Max's father.
she seems to have a history of hiding the truth.
you're british intelligence? - Yes.
sergel semak ordered my father's death.
the only reason he has control of zetrov is because the world believes all of the udinovs are dead.
everything he has is rightfully yours.
an udinov will run zetrov once again.
as long as there's a camera nearby, semak won't risk an attack.
I've been working for a long time to bring him down.
I'm facing knives at every turn.
Semak must be dealt with before he kills us both.
and the kill will be pinned on a foreign intelligence service.
I have a mole burrowed deep within that agency.
london
Max is growing up.
looks more like his father all the time.
how did he take ovechkin's death?
I think the change in scenery has done him good.
and how about his mother?
I've settled in.
I've never given you more than you could handle, have i?
no. I can make this work.
you always do.
cassandra was put in belarus by mi-6 to spy for the british.
but according to this...
the whole time she was also working for gogol.
women make the best double agents.
trust me.
Ari told you he had a mole lined up to do the hit.
now if this means what I think it means, then belarus barbie is going to kill semak.
which is you want, right? - Of course.
well, then what's the problem?
you don't have to do that.
yeah I do.
besides, there's not that many handymen that specialize in bullet holes.
it's okay to mourn her.
I know carla was like a mother to you.
who taught me not to trust mother figures.
Lemme give you a hand with that, okay?
Hey, Alex, what's up?
I'm sending you over something we stole from ari's computer.
it's a personnel file on a mole.
who is he?
it's a she. She's mi-6.
what?
what are you doing? - Watch the house.
where are you going?
I'm going to london to get my son.
wait, wait a minute- - For what?
Cassandra, we just found out, is gogol.
and gogol is the enemy.
Yes, but Max is innocent. - I know.
that's why I'm going to bring him back here.
here. Where there's no danger at all.
what happened to finishing this fight?
we don't. We get out.
and we go somewhere where they can't find us, and we live there.
we get out? We go somewhere?
are you listening to yourself? We raise a kid?
Yes! Absolutely.
no, Nikita, let me make myself clear.
I love you.
and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
it's just that it's been very hard making these pieces fit.
between you, now Max, this war with division-Maybe...
this will work.
I think you're getting ahead of yourself.
no, I don't think I am.
then...
I think...
I think you're getting ahead of me.
I'm not... Mother material, Micheal.
why not?
because I'm-it's friday, and my life is insane and not stable.
and Max has a mother.
whose lies are putting him in danger.
he would be better off with you than her.
what you're talking about is kidnapping.
taking him away from his mother to be raised by strangers.
it's gonna mess him up. Trust me.
you don't want him to pay for the mistakes of both of his parents.
you gotta confront her, face-to-face.
mi-6 HEADQUARTERS LONDON
for a while now we've known gogol agents were trying to steal plans for our new drone.
finally we've been able to identify the courier they're using.
I think you will agree this is very troubling.
troubling.
Madame director, it's a provocation.
I'm dispatching your team to russia immediately.
moscow
so you won't tell me what's bothering you?
Sean, I told you, this has nothing to do with you
I'd say it does.
if it affects the hit on semak, it affects my ability to protect you.
must be the tv crew. - They're not due for a while.
Semak. Why are you here?
search the rooms! - For what?
Katya-I know she's here. - She's not.
whoever told you you were a good liar, they were lying to you.
you didn't take her? - Why would i?
so that I couldn't see her.
where is she? - I told you-I don't know!
let him go.
you could have just knocked.
several days ago she ran away.
if she didn't come here, she must have gone to a place you know about.
you must help me find her.
and why would I help you?
because we both love her.
I know you think all I ever wanted was zetrov, and I kept katya as a trophy, but it's not the truth.
he's pretty good - I almost believed him.
I did.
M1\I-6 SAFE HOUSE MOSCOW - Anything? - Nothing yet.
do you know what always amazes me about the russians?
they're the only people who drink as much as we do?
I was gonna say how much they like the cold, but you're right.
hard to believe they built an empire when half the time they couldn't even march in a straight line.
and how is that any different than the british?
we're better looking.
Ay-up, there's the courier.
and far as I can tell...
the coast is clear.
good.
all I ask is you bring it back in one piece.
yourself, not so much
toggling street cam.
I've got eyes on the courier.
Tony, can you enhance that?
what is it?
probably nothing.
probably?
I'm going to check it out.
in case nothing turns into something.
how did you find me? - What's the gun for?
micheal, I am on a mission. - For mi-6 or for gogol?
I have a mole too. - I never wanted this.
micheal, I've been trying to get out for years!
so you've been gogol
since I was too young to know better.
they're going to be looking for me.
well, you better talk fast.
I was born in kletsk, raised in oxford, that is all true.
Gogol approached me when I was 19.
to spy for them? Or to work as a honeytrap?
I was broke, it was exciting.
I got to travel, see the world...
infiltrate british intelligence, sleep with a few dictators, maybe have a kid along the way.
Max is the one true thing in my world.
he is why I have to get out.
you've never done anything you regretted the rest of your life?
I did...
and it got my whole family killed.
that is why I'm here
to make sure that doesn't happen to Max.
so am i.
I finally convinced ari to let me leave gogol, retire from mi-6.
this is my last mission.
if you survive it. - Why wouldn't I survive it?
killing sergel semak is hardly a soft target.
semak? What does he have to do with this?
Cassandra, just give it up. I know.
this is just a hunting pack - Surveillance only.
mi-6 is supposed to grab a case containing phony blueprints.
Ari wants them chasing a mole that doesn't exist.
either you're lying or ari is.
I swear...
on our son's life.
Stuart is not here to assassinate anybody.
who's stuart?
the agent tailing the courier to lenin square right now.
lenin square?
that's zetrov headquarters.
that's where the courier's leading your man.
this is a frame job.
Stuart is not going to be the assassin
Nikita, the agent you're following is walking into a trap.
makes sense.
shoot him-finger mi-6 for killing semak.
it's easier to plant a smoking gun on a corpse.
sir.
thank you for coming.
this better be worth it.
I have some information about something i'd like to share.
of should I say someone.
you found katya?
I would ask you to accompany me, but this is a delicate matter.
timur, you and your men stay here until I return.
follow me.
he was about to take a shot at me!
somebody jumped him!
she's a pro
abort the mission and get out of there.
not while they're having a go at each other
I can grab the case.
stop.
are you okay? - Yeah, better than him.
who are you? Americans?
CIA.
what are you doing here?
same thing you were.
hang on, where you going with that?
sorry. It's ours. - How do you figure?
there's two of us, and one of you.
Cheers.
how can you believe anything that man says?
he was afraid, sean. He couldn't hide it.
but you're not going to actually help him find your mother?
I don't know where she is.
right now, i'm not even sure who she is.
my mother betrayed the country.
but at the end of the day, I will do anything in my power to keep her safe.
what-what did I say?
I'm glad you're looking out for me, sean.
I know I don't always make it easy.
well, nothing worth doing is ever easy.
Alex, we're ready for you.
so Alex, what's it like?
being back after all these years?
it's surreal.
uncle sergel has restored the house completely.
so when I walk down the halls, I still expect my mother and father to come out to greet me.
even though I know that's not possible.
if they did... What would you say to them?
that I love them.
and I miss them very much.
especially my mother.
why do you say that?
the last time we were together we had a quarrel.
I didn't understand how she was acting, what she was saying.
but I've had some time to think about it.
and I think that I understand what she must have been going through.
if I could just see her again, I would try to make things right between us.
INTERWIEWWITH ALWXANDRA UDINOV
I miss her so much.
is katya okay?
you're taking me to her, right?
this isn't about katya.
but it couldn't wait any longer.
who did this?
it must've been mi-6. - Why oleg?
he wasn't the target. You were.
at least that's what the story was going to be.
correction. What it's still going to be.
what story?
the story of your fall.
and my rise.
good to see you.
I mean, aside from you being on every tv and newsstand in the country.
too much?
just as long as you remember it's not about you.
you're fighting for something much bigger than yourself.
this must've been under the door.
fan mail? - How did it go with cassandra?
did you stop her from making the hit?
for now. That's why we're here.
we're trying to help you find another way to take semak down.
since, you know, I was in the neighborhood.
we can't stay for long. If ari finds out we're here, then it'll blow everything.
someone called from the front desk.
he didn't a message, no phone number.
it says it's from babochka. - Who's babochka?
it's not a person, it's a place.
the family dacha. We used to hunt babochka there.
butterflies.
it's my mother. She got my message.
she's telling me where she is.
Semak's been murdered.
they cornered us in the alleyway...
we tried to fend them off, but they shot oleg.
and then they executed sergel.
did you get a good look at them?
it happened too fast.
but judging by their accents and their firearms, my first guess would be mi-6.
what?
Spyder found evidence that a group of their agents landed in moscow hours ago.
they set up shop in an abandoned storefront by pushkin square. Assemble a team immediately.
I want the men responsible for this dead before they leave russia.
of course.
Hello?
no, no-it's too soon.
people will get suspicious.
in a day or two.
what is it?
that was ari. Sergel semak is dead.
that's what you wanted, right?
how do you feel?
empty.
it's all I've thought about for so long.
now that it's happened...
I feel...
just...
revenge never turns out the way you think that it would.
something's not right.
Ari goes through all the trouble to find a fall guy, we prevent that, and he kills semak anyway?
there's a safe house full of fall guys.
Ari knows exactly where it is. - We'll help you.
no, you have a lead on your mother.
you gotta find her.
okay.
you can't honestly want us to tuck tail and run?
our jet is waiting on the tarmac.
you can come with, or hitch another ride on your own.
how did they find us so quickly?
Darren, are you all right?
looks worse than it is.
try not to move, mate.
hold your fire, i'm coming in!
CIA. I'm here to help.
you.
she's one of the yanks who pinched our intel.
how did you make us
later. My partner's out there holding them off.
my guess is back up'll be here any minute.
come on.
you two have a knack for timing, i'll grant you that.
what are you waiting for, an invite from the queen? Get in!
just like I remember.
what the hell? - What's wrong?
Gogol? - No, division.
you're right. I've seen those guys around ops.
what are they doing here?
drop your weapons now!
Alexandra! What are you doing?
these men are protecting me.
I gave you nine men.
we had the british dead to rights.
then Nikita came out of nowhere.
Nikita?
are you sure it was her?
her and her partner ambushed us.
I think they were working with mi-6.
I saw them take off in a car together.
mi-6 couldn't have tipped them off.
but somebody else might have.
I've sent you a file. I need you to leak it for me.
to mi-6.
let's see how fast they turn on cassandra.
we don't have much time, do we?
the debrief officers are driving up from london.
they'll take our after-action reports, try to contact your superiors at langley
and discover we don't actually work for the cia.
maybe I can distract them while you slip away.
no, I think we can actually fight our way out of here.
you want my help?
Yeah, act surprised.
don't forget your tea.
pretend this is not control.
act as if we're chatting about something mundane, the weather for example.
it's warmer here than in Moscow.
Yes, it is.
cassandra is a gogol spy.
are you sure it's gonna rain?
look, I can show you the intercept
I look forward to it.
I convinced the goons to give you guys some privacy.
you threaten to knock heads? - More like knocking glasses.
go easy on 'em. - I won't.
sergel loved me.
I know.
but that love got your father killed.
knowing that made it impossible to stay with him.
he sent men looking for you.
one of them found me. ari.
he said he was on my side, that he had no love for sergel as well.
he even posted american guards to protect me, so sergel would never know I was here.
why did you come here?
because everybody had forgotten it.
except me.
when I remember the three of us as a family, I think about this place.
you were very young. Pfft... As were we.
it was back when nikolal wasn't an oligarch.
he was just a father.
Priviet.
Yes, I'm fine. I'm here with Alexandra.
Yes, I called her.
I keep underestimating your resourcefulness.
you also keep lying to me.
I was planning it as a surprise.
I was going to tell you at the appropriate time.
and when was that?
once semak was out of the picture. Otherwise you would have led him straight to her.
this was what I was hoping to meet with you about.
well, that and one other matter-I have a proposition for you.
so, stuart...You got quiet all of a sudden.
well, there's not much to say, is there?
it always amazes me what people keep to themselves, don't you think?
I was supposed to die, wasn't i?
that guy I was following, he was no courier
Stuart, I don't know what you're talking about.
you damn well know! So does control.
she's gogol.
just because the mission failed doesn't mean it was compromised.
when you slipped out of the house back there, did you give us up?
were you talking to someone?
excuse our mess.
hell, if it hadn't been for the cia sticking their noses into our business, we'd all be dead...
and gogol would probably be pinning you with a medal.
good, keep your mouth shut.
make us torture it out of you
don't make me shoot the other one.
I'm sorry.
mi-6 will be all over heathrow and gatwick, but not where we're headed.
how far back are they? - I can't see them anymore.
don't take your foot off the gas, we haven't lost them yet.
we need to get Max, now.
is he at home? - With gerald, the sitter.
mi-6 will be heading there. We have to hurry.
mi-6 is on our tail now. If you want to keep Max safe, you lead them in the opposite direction.
no, they will use him as leverage.
she's right. - We need to get him.
I'll get him.
they're on the lookout for you, not me.
call your sitter, tell him to take Max for a walk in regent's park.
Hey, I'm not gonna let your son grow up without his parents.
I'm putting him in your arms, today. I promise.
you gotta keep driving.
you don't want me to slow down?
a little.
you want me to sign over all my shares in zetrov over to you.
you'll be well-compensated, of course.
and why would I do that?
to assure your mother's continued safety.
you'll be free to go with her wherever you like.
don't take my word for it.
congratulations, you won.
why don't you put us on speaker?
I think your mother should hear this as well.
when you transfer your shares to ari, we will give you and katya enough money to live well for the rest of your lives.
that's not what this is about.
of course it is. You never wanted zetrov anyway.
I'm sending you a contract.
you might wanna answer that, gerald.
Cassandra?
Yes, of course. He's playing with his jet.
she's right here.
okay, I guess I can do that.
there it is.
she got him out.
thank god.
Yes.
I think we should tell him you're his father.
I don't think it's the right time right now.
if he missed me before- - Maybe he won't have to.
maybe you could come with us.
you risk your life to get us out of trouble.
get yourself out as well.
Cassandra, remember when you were talking about Max being the thing that gets you through life
no matter how hard it gets or how tough it gets...
I knew what you were saying...
because I have someone like that too.
there's no way i'm gonna leave her.
I'm afraid, Micheal.
we'll get you to safety- - For how long?
now I have two intelligence services hunting me... And Max.
every moment i'll be wondering if the other shoe is about to drop.
that is never going to happen.
we're not gonna let it.
I have a lead on cassandra.
she used her expense account to charter a private plane.
so I closed the account, but the transaction's still going through.
mi-6 must have gotten the message.
she's feeling the heat.
you want me to send a team?
no. Track the plane.
we'll be waiting wherever she lands.
you're not actually considering this, are you?
how could I not?
you can't let them force you into doing this.
it's not about that. It's about getting what we deserve.
and that is what they will give us.
nobody gives you anything, mama.
you have to earn what you get.
zetrov belonged to papa.
and do you know how he earned it?
other people's blood.
it's not a company. It's a curse.
and now we have the chance to rid ourselves of it.
you think it's a curse now - Imagine what it'll be like if amanda gets hold of it.
zetrov destroyed your father. And sergel.
it will destroy them as well.
don't let it destroy you. Let it go.
you should listen to your mother, Alex.
she knows what's best.
no she doesn't. You do.
so I get what I want...If you get what you want.
it's called "everyone wins.
except Nikita.
what?
you're pinning semak's death on cassandra. Nikita's with her now.
Nikita is not your problem, Alex. You don't need to fight her war anymore.
this is about what you deserve.
that's just the thing, amanda. You don't deserve to win.
and I'm not gonna let you.
if you walk out that door, we will hunt you down.
mama!
we're not out of the woods yet.
are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah, i'll do whatever it takes.
control, i'm at the airfield.
no, we're too late. She just took off.
we can figure that out later. Contact raf brampton.
tell them to scramble jets to intercept a turbo-prop, tail markings lima, tango, alpha, kilo
bloody thing just burst apart.
it was a gogol jet-They must've slipped a bomb on board.
she got what was coming to her.
Cassandra's plane has disappeared.
where did it go?
down. The emergency crews are looking for survivors.
there won't be any.
another one of mi-6's "accidents.
my flight got canceled. I'm gonna need a ride.
we'll see you soon.
I don't know how to thank you enough.
and we'll be safe there?
Yes, you will. Sean's gonna take good care of you.
but I thought we would be going together.
mama, I want to be with you more than anything.
it's not that simple.
I'm a part of something much bigger.
and I want to be a part of that fight.
you are so strong.
is this what your father taught you?
Nyet.
now that nobody's looking for you, you shouldn't have a problem getting out.
it's a little hard to believe I'm "dead.
you get used to it.
I'm sure Max will miss his...Friend.
we'll be in touch.
Yeah. I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.
Look...You're going to disappear.
but I'm not.
those people that are after you-If they were to track me down, follow me and bug me.
I could lead them right to you, right to Max.
and I would never forgive myself if that happened.
that means I can't tell him about his father.
I know.
you... Be safe.
you too.
both of you.
good-bye, Micheal.
good-bye, Max.
thank you.
you're doing the right thing. - Am i?
when I was growing up, I thought that any parent that gave their child up was unforgivable.
that there would never be a reason or an excuse for it.
and now I'm standing here.
what you did...Was an act of grace.
you're a good father, Micheal.
then allow me to prove myself.
if I'm satisfied, we can aim higher.
I'm aiming higher. Membership in your group.
we'll see.
damn. Percy's going nuclear. - And Nikita?
she just thinks I'm building a bomb.
well, the early ballistic missiles used navigation satellites for targeting.
what if the satellite is the weapon?
I have commandeered an S.D.I. Satellite.
all right, Percy. You have our attention.
let's take this to the next level.
Mr. President, you're going to announce that peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have failed.
Percy doesn't get to win. - Nikita, what do we do?
we take away his trump card, the satellite he controls from division.
Birkhoff, you quarterback. Alex and Sean, you take out the division agents that control the entrance.
michael and I will infiltrate.
are you kidding? We can't go in that place. - It's suicide.
blow the charge!
everyone, stop!
just calm down.
you don't want to do this.
eight YEARS AGO
open it or he dies.
I can't.
let me out of here.
there is no out.
Michael, crossbow's down.
Percy's satellite is disabled.
still training 'em real well down here.
Birkhoff, copy back.
status?
the explosion took out server two, but core systems are intact.
exits are sealed.
this is Percy. Division has been breached.
weapons restrictions have been lifted.
you may arm yourselves at will.
michael and Nikita are in the facility.
find them, kill them, and you will be rewarded.
Alex, are you there?
Yeah, I'm taking fire!
just lost Nikita and Michael.
same here!
damn it. It's gotta be a lockdown.
I'm out!
here. - Alex!
what do you mean, dead?
no signal traffic in or out.
only the guards can talk on a dedicated line.
division lockdown is designed for when a recruit tries to escape.
or an exrecruit breaks in.
also means I can't tell you if the big particle beam in the sky is offline or not.
damn it. I gotta go.
Mr. President.
we're out of time, Mr. Fletcher.
Percy's ultimatum was pretty clear.
sir, may we contact him?
tell him you need more time, the cabinet doesn't agree.
this lunatic's already melted down one reactor with that particle beam.
I will not stand by and watch him do it near a major city.
I have to play along for now. Do you understand?
are the marines in place?
they're about a mile from the farm.
sir, I think you should reconsider the military option, especially against division.
is there something that you're not telling us?
the covert operatives I was working with two of them are inside division right now.
doing what?
trying to disable the satellite.
I don't know if they've succeeded, but I do know if you send those marines in, they'll be pinned down.
I'm about to kill a peace treaty that this country's been praying for for a decade.
do you think my presidency's gonna survive that?
if I go down, Percy goes down.
as for your people, they're on their own.
Michael, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
we're on the party line.
awesome. Hey, division.
it's great to be back. I've missed you.
they're on the security channel.
look. We can't update Birkhoff until we get up top.
I need to get you out of here.
where do you want to meet?
well, the only place in division we ever had any fun.
copy that.
live FROM THE WHITHE HOUSE
good evening, everyone.
I've come to the conclusion that certain warrior cultures are incapable of finding peace, and it is for this reason and many others that I officially withdraw my support for this treaty.
it is deeply flawed, and it does not serve America's interests to support it.
peace may come, but not here, and sadly, not tonight.
call off lockdown. - Sir?
I need to make a phone call.
lockdown ACTIVE
lockdown CLEARED
it is for this reason and for many others that I officially withdraw my support I'm watching.
ask and ye shall receive.
knock and the door shall be opened.
so I'm in.
the group has approved your status.
however, you may have another problem heading your way.
those are U. S. Marines.
vehicle signatures confirm it.
you sure this is the only place we ever had fun?
sounds like we're about to have some more.
how many?
multispectral analysis puts the number of troops at 205.
I don't understand. Division's part of government.
why would the marines be here?
I asked for them.
they're here to make sure that Nikita and her little band of insurgents don't escape the perimeter.
it won't be an issue if we find them first.
I'm almost up top.
what are the jarheads doing?
they're in fourman units, taking positions along the perimeter.
they're making the cordon. It's usually followed by a raid.
they don't know us from the real targets, so just sit tight.
that's the only way to sit right now.
you all right?
there's only one way for this to go.
downhill.
after this whole thing's over you know, this whole storm the castle, save humanity thing I think you and me ought to go on a proper date.
are you kidding me?
Hey, come on. Let me down easy, why don't you?
there's literally hundreds of marines out there, and you're thinking about that?
Hey, you know, that helps me focus.
it gives me, something to look forward to, you know?
like a goal.
you are unbelievable.
that's funny. It's not the first time I've heard that.
although usually, it's after the date.
I'm just glad you're okay.
Oh, Ryan, we'd be so much better without a couple hundred marines waiting for us.
I tried to call them off, but the president really wants Percy's head.
especially now that crossbow's down.
well, starting a war won't help.
tell the president we got a plan to hijack the comm system and get a message to everybody inside.
if they find out the truth about Percy, they'll hand him over.
hang on. Call coming in.
bold speech, Mr. President.
historical.
your satellite weapon's dead.
you won't be far behind.
see, that's why I didn't vote for you.
you don't know how to solve the problem that's right in front of you.
you're just like every tinpot dictator I've ever had to shake hands with.
you are a small man with a big chip on your shoulder, a common thug.
there's nothing common about me.
and as far as my satellite weapon being dead, it was never alive in the first place.
what the hell are you talking about?
power, Mr. President. Real power.
the kind that changes history.
the kind that Cortez had over the Aztecs.
they fell to their knees and gave up without a fight.
Why?
because they believed he could turn off the sun.
all he did was check the charts and saw an eclipse was coming.
you're saying there was never any satellite?
Oh, it's It's up there.
took some trouble to get control of it too.
I even retacked the trajectory just to seal the deal.
but the particle beam that was always fiction.
brilliant science fiction.
they never got that to work.
how did you blow the reactor?
very easy.
put a little plutonium inside a demon core, and the next thing you know, kaboom.
a cataclysmic reaction that you naturally took to be a laser beam from outer space.
this whole thing's been a giant con.
you, Mr. President...
in your loincloth, with a bone in your nose, trembling with fear and awe at my feet as I turn off the sun.
and I'm gonna do it again.
the remaining plutonium is in the hands of my most trusted operative.
he has orders to cause another meltdown, this time in a major metropolitan area, unless he's told to abort.
what do you want?
to surrender.
I've saved this country more times than you or anyone else will ever know.
a warrior deserves a little respect, don't you think?
I will walk out of here, Mr. President, maybe not a hero, but on my own terms...
immunity and the retirement of my choosing.
if my operative doesn't hear from me in the next 30 minutes, he will proceed as planned.
what if I say no?
don't say no.
his most trusted operative.
it's gotta be Roan.
Birkhoff, do you have any idea how to find him?
off the top of my head, no.
roan doesn't exactly smile for security cameras.
what about his vehicle?
he's probably using a division car.
could work, if I could get my hands on a vehicle manifest.
Nikita, we need to find roan and get the plutonium out of the equation.
I agree.
Alex and Sean, you go after Roan.
got it. - What about us?
we go after Percy, take him out of the equation.
I knew she was gonna say that.
unless we all think that he's gonna retire.
look, it's just another play.
he's probably got somebody waiting on the outside.
then it's settled.
are you forgetting about the marines?
I can get you past the marines.
Birkhoff, try and hack the vehicle manifest.
Nikita and Michael, good luck.
alpha team seven, I've got you in the west service corridor.
please proceed to...
video CHAT REQUEST - USER BIRKHOFF
are you insane?
if Percy catches us, you're gonna get me killed.
I know, I know, I know.
listen, I'm sorry, Sonya.
I'm in a serious jam here.
I really need your help. Look.
Percy is a bad guy.
you know that, right?
just nod.
I need to find Roan. It's important.
look, if Percy strikes again and another reactor melts down, those marines out there are gonna melt you down.
and everyone around you.
I'm trying to save your life here, Sonya.
now, all you have to do is let me look at who checked out what vehicle today.
all right.
but no more.
I could kiss you.
METRDRAIL COMMUTER PARKING LOT BETHESDA, MD
Birkhoff, we're here.
security camera has Roan's SUV pulling in three hours ago, and it never sees it leave.
found it.
car looks empty. Approaching to confirm.
Hey. You never said yes. - To what?
you never asked me out on a date.
you said I was a goal.
Really? I could've sworn I asked you out.
Birkhoff, we got a body.
I.D?
nothing.
all right, snap a photo, send it over to me.
Yeah.
sending.
access 8
alpha team five, a panel's been breached inside the environmental control room on sublevel two.
E.C.R. is clear.
the panel was opened with a small charge.
it was left here.
they were trying to draw the teams there.
why would they do that?
Freeze!
trust me. I'm not gonna move.
but if you shoot me, things might get messy.
you trained us for this, sir.
we're fully prepared to shoot you and jump on that grenade.
in the event of a breach, the integrity of operations must be maintained.
if your actions threaten that, you regroup and form a new approach.
apparently, I didn't train you well enough.
you were probably busy training me.
Where's Percy?
where is he?
I don't know.
Oh, you don't know.
office?
I can redirect security from here.
clear you a path.
go.
be careful.
speak for yourself, hon.
en routeto target. 30 minutes.
get in your position and wait for the signal.
Nikita, where are you?
in the lighting tube. I'm about to land.
all right, you're clear.
finally realized what I hate about this place.
it's the hum.
Hello, Nikita.
we're not letting you go.
Michael, I'm in Amanda's old place.
wait, stop.
there's an Alpha team right outside.
get rid of them.
don't.
all right, everyone, listen up.
most of you people know me, and you know I'm not the enemy.
neither are they.
what did Percy tell you they were here for?
to help catch you.
they're here for Percy.
open your eyes.
Sonya, she's on sublevel four.
alpha teams three and six, there's been a reported sighting on sublevel seven.
move out.
copy that.
Nikita, you're clear.
right outside his office.
Percy's OFFICE
override the security on that door.
Percy's OFFICE UNLOCKED
you're empty.
going upstairs to surrender to the law.
that not good enough for you?
it's not good enough for you.
you have a way out of this.
I just don't know what it is yet.
Where's Roan?
as we say in the trade, that's for me to know and you to find out.
where is he?
where? - You can't kill me.
heart trigger.
the second I die, Roan gets a signal.
the meltdown begins.
then I'll torture it out of you.
we got time.
no, you don't.
the search team will be here any minute.
it's gonna take longer than that to break me.
then we'll buy some time.
you're gonna get on that intercom, and you're gonna call off the boys, or I take off your boys.
they won't believe me.
sure they will, because you're gonna tell them something they've never heard before.
the truth.
this is Percy.
I'm sure you're all very curious to know what's been going on today.
I started this organization not just to protect the country, but to save young lives, give them a new direction.
and I guess somewhere along the way, I lost direction myself.
stopped seeing you as great Americans and started to view you as mercenaries.
a means to an end.
little by little, division became a criminal organization.
those marines are out there to shut us down, bring it to an end.
by morning, you'll all be dead or renditioned to a secret prison or some godforsaken place because of me.
I betrayed you, each and every one of you.
and I don't regret a minute of it.
if anybody has a problem with that, - come to my office, - you are pathetic street trash.
what are you doing?
throwing gas on the fire.
let's get him.
they don't care what happens to me.
they don't care if I die.
but you should.
you bastard.
this is your final mission, Nikita.
stop the meltdown. Save the world.
the only way to do that is to get me out of here alive.
relax.
I'm not gonna shoot you. You're my bodyguard.
I need you.
Nikita, the natives are getting restless.
you gotta move.
current RAER
Birkhoff, Roan killed this guy for a reason.
please tell me you got a hit.
working on it.
there you are.

you can hide, but you can't run.
Kyle Devry AGE: 38 SEX: MALE DEPARTMENT
what the hell?
hang on a second, guys.
he's a what?
says he works in waste remediation at a classified government site.
he's like a super secret janitor.
it's something called N.M.R.
never heard of it. Must be over my clearance.
Mr. President?
we believe Percy may be targeting something called N.M.R.
do you know what that is?
of course.
it's the national mall reactor, right below us.
a nuclear reactor under D.C?
it's kind of a backup generator for the government.
we put it in during the y2k scare.
Birkhoff, did you get that?
I got it, and we're on it.
almost through, sir.
advance team, prepare to breach.
Nikita, there's an Alpha team on your six, just around the corner.
interesting name.
you are going to serve your country.
welcome to division.
someone order up a cruel irony?
so, the national mall reactor.
you never could resist cheap symbolism.
parting shot at the prez.
I'm afraid you'll never find Roan in there.
Alex and Sean are tracking him right now.
the princess and the seal?
there's a circus act if ever there was one.
it's too late, Nikita.
after tonight, no one will be able to touch me.
what is that supposed to mean?
it means I'm done with division.
I'm moving on.
but you?
everything in your life, anything with any meaning, came from inside these walls.
you'll never be able to let go of this place.
has he swiped the stolen I.D. through any checkpoints?
not yet. - How about the facility?
there can't be that many places for him to inject the plutonium.
actually, there can.
the cooling system has multiple access points throughout the compound.
fantastic.
Oh, and guns and nuclear reactors don't play well together.
just saying.
okay, I think we should split up.
you go that way.
I'll take this way. Better chances of finding Roan.
okay.
Hey, I didn't meant to put you on the spot before.
Oh, it's okay.
I just get nervous in the field.
about you.
I can take care of myself.
so is that a no?
you still haven't asked me yet.
Birkhoff, what's the update on Roan?
you'll never find him. - Shut up.
unfortunately, I think he's right.
we got Alex on site, but we're talking serious maze.
maybe Percy was lying about the N.M.R.
Yeah, he's lied about everything else.
drop it! Drop it now.
you don't want to be doing this.
please.
trust me. I hate him too.
I'm in a hurry.
commander, this is red team.
go ahead.
we got two tangos near the barn, sir.
one of them says he's surrendering.
copy that. Escort them to my position on the double.
that's far enough!
it's over, Percy.
you got what you wanted. Call off the meltdown.
well, I guess this is goodbye.
one last thing, though.
I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.
down the hatch.
help me up.
I'm done helping you.
if I die, Roan gets the signal.
Birkhoff, there's gonna be a signal from the division silo in about five seconds.
get ready to track it.
no.
got him. I got him.
triangulating
he's at the south access tunnel.
he's near the cooling conduit.
supplemental ACCESS
so, you wanna go out?
don't do this. - Nikita.
she's making a mistake, Ryan. Tell her.
this is no longer your mission.
advance team, what's your status?
advance team.
advance team, come in!
listen to me.
division's back is up against the wall.
they will fight to the death.
if you pursue this course, I am telling you, all you're doing is upping the body count on both sides.
what course would you have me pursue?
right now, they are in a command crisis.
their master is dead.
they're looking for orders.
let me go down there.
you? You're their enemy.
division agents only respect what they've been made to fear.
they've been made to fear me.
my fight was never with you.
it was with Percy. You know this.
I've spoken to the vice president.
told her that I could negotiate the peaceful surrender of all personnel.
she believed me.
but I think you all know better than that.
don't you?
the second you put down your guns, they'll gun you down, because legally, division doesn't exist.
that's gonna change today.
and they're just gonna have to deal with it.
you are not invisible.
you exist.
and if they want to get to you, they're gonna have to go through me first.
let's talk.
immunity, identity, absolution.
never gonna happen. But I can promise no custody, no extreme rendition.
rendition? How do you think we got here?
the government told us they were giving us a second chance, but they never gave us a choice.
the oval office is never gonna give everyone in this facility a golden parachute.
the problem is a lot bigger than this facility.
division field agents all over the world have heard about this breach.
they're not gonna come in from the cold, Ryan.
they'll go rogue.
I know.
that's why I told the vice president the ideal unit to control the fallout from division is division itself.
keep division running?
until we can clean up the mess it's made.
there are still monsters out there.
tallinn, ESTDNIA
after three days, finally.
decryption COMPLETE
I told you it could be done.
accessing DATABASE
game CHANGE
this is insane.
what kind of secrets are these?
the kind that kill.
who else but division is going to stop them?
I heard Percy tell the president he was just a messenger, probably for whoever is on the other side of his surrender.
we need to find out who that person is.
so division is going to run itself.
no.
they want me to run it.
I'm not gonna do it without you.
this isn't going to work.
it's the only way it works.
Nikita, you can trust me.
this isn't what we've been fight for.
I thought you fight for justice.
is that what you call this?
this is the best thing we can do.
I was saving lives, lives that the system was gonna throw away.
are you telling me you think there's a good side of division?
no.
not unless you're running it one day.
or you.
when they gave you the ability to kill, they also gave you the ability to protect.
they want an answer.
what's it gonna be?
division is in good hands with Ryan, Nikita.
we can go.
where?
home.
remember? You did say that.
I said it.
but I don't know what a home is, Michael.
I've never had one.
all I know is...
I grew up here.
I learned right from wrong here, and I fell in love here.
those people down there, they deserve a chance, and you know we can give that to them.
you think I'm crazy, right?
that is just wrong.
what numb nuts turned this place into the starship enterprise?
I need to hunt down loose trackers, but I'm not sure that the servers are capable, and I thought you could reconfigure them.
sure.
let me show you how it's done.
they have sustained a lot of damage with all the gunfire.
Hi.
you know how division feels about fraternization.
division's dead, baby.
isn't it?
where am I?
closest hospital that won't ask questions.
division.
Hey, speaking of questions, there's, a yes or no question that, when you passed out there was a lot going on, but, - maybe, - Alex.
how are you feeling?
getting there.
are you okay? What happened?
a lot.
do you remember what I said when I decided I was gonna let you infiltrate division?
here we go.
here we go again.
division took her freedom.
then taught her to kill.
she fought back and won.
she saved my life and a lot of others.
now we work together, taking down the worst of the worst, making right what Division made wrong.
kowloon OARK, HONK KONG
dad, do you have some money to feed the ducks?
we gotta leave for a plane in five minutes.
but it'll only just take two.
please?
here, use mine.
I'm done with it.
two minutes.
Hey, Davis. How's the wine biz?
what the hell is this?
what are you doing here? We're out in the open.
it's a beautiful day.
did something happen?
have I been compromised?
cause I'm about to get on a plane in two hours with my son.
relax. Compromised.
been watching too many spy movies.
you need to branch out, re-watch the classics.
rio Bravo, Network.
you know what was just on the other day?
godfather part one.
got me thinking.
you remember that part where Marlon Brando is playing hide-and-seek with his grandson in the garden?
and he has a heart attack right there, and the kid thinks he's still playing around.
and he just sorta giggles.
still gives me a chill.
is this supposed to be some kind of a joke?
no.
just curious.
you think your son's gonna giggle?
myMy son
will die today.
not really.
I just need your heart to beat faster.
it speeds the toxin.
Joigin.
dad?
dad?
dad?

dad!
help, someone! Dad!
dad! Dad!
scanning DATABASE 88% confirmed match.
okay, guys.
we are officially go.
get a hold of her yet?
phone's at her apartment, but she's not answering.
problem?
just got confirmation on our first rogue target.
intel is six hours cold, and I can't raise Nikita.
think you can track her down?
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, well.
Oh, we usually grab tea after class, if you want to join.
Yeah, it's just right here.
Yeah.
you know what, why not?
I'm Jen, by the way.
I'm Zoe. And you are?
I'm-- - Nikita!
we need you back at the office.
it's a minor emergency.
next time.
damn, I wish I had her job.
no, still not used to being back here.
I know the place looks the same, but it's a new Division.
everything's changed.
yo, Mikey, I was in the middle of pimping this ride, not pimping it out.
ask before thou takest.
almost everything.
you guys ready to go kick some super spy ass?
we've been actively searching for a month, so someone was bound to poke their head out first.
martin here wins the prize.
Martin. I don't remember him.
I do. Hong Kong, right?
the past six years.
cover was a fashion photographer.
deactivated his tracker on June 4th at oh-eight-thirty.
that's four hours after we sent out the "Percy's dead, come on back to the ranch" email.
I told you they'd go rogue when they found out we took over Division.
and I told you we'd have to be the ones to bring 'em in.
okay, so what is he up to now?
wine broker to the ultra-rich.
42, dies of a heart attack in Kowloon Park two days ago.
no pre-existing condition, but H. K. cops find no evidence of foul play.
except his son sees him talking to this guy on a park bench just before he died.
of course there's no follow-up because this guy doesn't exist.
all right, wait a minute, flag on the play.
martin cuts out his tracker, goes dark for a month, and pops back up on the grid to whack a wine dealer?
my guess is Mr. Kellogg was into more than the latest Bordeaux.
your bright boys in Beijing dig through this, you'll find proof of a spy.
but not the other spies he's working with.
why don't you sell me all their names?
we like to buy in bulk over here.
no, the deal's bodies.
one at a time. Accidental fatalities.
that way your hands stay clean, but the message gets sent
stay the hell out of China.
and what if I were to have you...
meet with an accident?
then you'd never uncover the network that's right under your nose.
I'll call you after the next one.
gonna lay low for a beat.
the C. I.A. must have screwed you bad to make you betray your own like this.
who said I was C. I.A?
so how do you figure Kellogg for C. I.A?
well, when you work there as long as I did you start to see the angles.
china has the fastest growing crop of billionaires in the world.
a lot of those guys were on Davis Kellogg's client list.
it is a perfect cover.
if you wanna confirm your hunch,
I could always check with Langley.
by "check" he means "hack.
lightly peek. - Gently penetrate.
Hey, no hacking the C. I.A.okay?
we do not do stuff like that anymore.
this is the new Division, all right?
and it's our job to clean up the mess made by the old one.
loose canons like Martin, they represent that threat.
so we need to neutralize him quietly.
okay?
whatever you say, boss.
hong Kong?
welcome to the Grand Mandarin Hotel.
do you have a reservation?
Sestok, Mr. and Mrs.
we're pleased to offer a bay-view suite for extended stay, and a gift basket arrived for you.
we've placed it in your room.
this I could get used to.
you may have to.
extended stay, huh?
well, Birkhoff will be doing his sweep with the street cams, and that'll take at least a couple days. So
Yeah, that's right.
so I was thinking, maybe you should take your jacket off, mister.
stay a while.
they got the air blasting in here, don't they?
I'll keep you warm.
all right, okay.
all right.
are you okay? - Yeah.
cause you seem a little
what?
jumpy.
no.
a little bit.
little bit of Mexican jumping bean going on.
the mission?
well 'cause you know there's always gonna be a mission.
might as well enjoy it.
all right.
there is always gonna be another mission.
our life may be mission to mission for a while, right?
so it'd be pointless to wait until things were normal.
I hate waiting.
wait.
man cannot survive on mission alone.
wait, wait.
what?
Ryan said that Martin was on extended assignment for six years.
six years?
so is the guy a monk?
I don't think so.
Hey, hi, Nikki. What's up?
how's Hong Kong?
yo, stop looking at pictures of Sonya and help me out with something.
what? What are you
what are you talking about? Where are you?
Hey, can you pull up the pictures that Martin took when he was undercover?
he was a fashion photog, right?
so he had to submit his proofs to magazines.
all right, what are you looking for?
guy worked with a lot of models.
I wanna know if he had a favorite.
gotcha.
lucky for you I already hacked most of these fashion rags.
we're all lucky that you're a perv.
look, what happened with Sonya was not my fault, okay?
you gotta talk to her, dude.
tell her.
she's the one not talking to me.
you know, the one thing Percy and Amanda got right was outlawing internal relationships.
you still gotta talk to her.
okay.
good. Good.
good, because I think
no, the model. I found her.
at least I found the one he uses more than the others.
Lynn Capshaw.
and she lives in Hong Kong.
follow the honey.
that was a nice surprise.
I didn't know when I'd see you again.
I've just been busy.
you like the necklace?
I love it.
you get a bonus or something?
Yeah, something like that.
looks good on you.
you look good on me.
Yes, hello, this is Gong Cha Takeaway.
I'm sorry, but we're all out of pig's ear today.
I didn't order. Wrong number.
like I would eat there.
may I help you?
gong Cha Takeaway, please.
what do you got? - Well, she's there.
listen, when you interrogate this one, snap a couple of pics for the file.
we're not gonna interrogate her, Birkhoff.
just gonna ask her a few questions about her boyfriend.
what's wrong?
division.
who's Division?
police emergency.
Hello, I'd like to report an assault.
number 17 Queens Road C, unit 30.
there's a woman screaming, and I think I saw two people with guns.
help please.
Martin, what is this?
I'm sorry.
what?
I'm not a photographer.
nice place.
she was definitely home, right?
confirmed.
she's still warm.
someone escaped out the back window.
egress to the roof.
why kill her? She's not a threat.
no, but we are.
window?
no, that's no good. - It worked for Martin.
that's what he wants. That's what he's counting on.
if we run, it triggers a city-wide manhunt.
the heat on us makes it harder to track him.
so what's our alt? We get caught?
no, you take the window.
right. - And I get caught.
no. - Yes.
H. K.P. D. will think they have their man, case closed, which leaves you free to hunt Martin.
Michael, no. - Nikita, yes.
look, it's just the locals.
it's Bolivia all over again, remember?
which means you can break me out, easy, but after you bag that son of a bitch.
I will see you at the extract.
I promise.
hong Kong police have arrived at the model's apartment.
someone made a 911 call.
ops, Nikita.
ops, go ahead.
I got it! I got it!
you, move.
go to my station. Move!
target's out of pocket.
I planted Michael's comm on his vehicle.
can you track it?
can't track it, but we can listen in.
good move.
you have a bead on Michael?
Nikita, return to location blue and code in secure.
in Hong Kong for pleasure.
you find murder pleasurable, Mr. Sestok?
I am and demand you
I want to talk to a lawyer.
your Cantonese is very good.
that won't help you with me.
neither will a lawyer, I'm afraid.
to start, we find you standing over the body of a dead woman.
and then I look in your coat pocket.
and I find motive.
my guess is she said no.
actually, I never got around to asking her.
I'm gonna need that back.
no.
what you need is a miracle.
I slipped a data router on the embassy phone line.
if police call the U. S. Consulate, they' get us.
wolf team is en route from the airport.
yo, he's at the airport!
he's-- he's at the airport.
for loading and unloading of passengers only.
it just keeps repeating. He's parked there.
he might be trying to flee the country.
can we get a visual?
should I send Wolf team back to the airport, sir?
they can turn around. - No.
move. Move!
Nikita's coded in. Location blue.
you injured?
no. What's the status on Michael?
local custody pending arraignment.
waiting for him to make contact.
what's the play?
Nikita, we will get him home.
Ryan, send me his location.
martin may be trying to flee the country as we speak.
I need you at the airport to set up a survey now.
a survey is a two-man op, and I am one man down.
I know.
no, Ryan, I'm flying solo here.
michael needs extraction, and I can't be in two places at once.
I know, that's why I'm sending in support.
wolf team is en route to rendezvous with you now.
miss Udinov, welcome to the Grand Mandarin.
it is a great honor to receive you.
do you have any bottled water?
Absolutely.
I got it. I got it, thanks.
here we go, right?
Yeah, just a little sooner than I'd hoped.
so...
are we Alex or Alexandra?
I'm gonna take this coat off.
all right, I want us wired in an uplinked before anyone gets a potty break.
hey there, you don't mind if we crash in your room?
Yes, and don't touch my mini bar.
okay, Martin never went through gate security.
I got him stepping into a cab, city bound.
he's using the airport just to switch?
no, he grabbed something in there.
looks like a kit bag.
probably stored in a locker.
resupply. He's gearing up.
boy wants a rematch with Nikki.
no, that's too emotional.
the guy uses his girlfriend's corpse to set a trap.
he's taking the risk to stay in town.
it's--it's calculated.
it's practical.
he may have another target.
another C. I.A. asset.
there could be a whole network embedded over there.
if there was, Martin would know every member of it.
Percy probably loaned him out to the C. I.A. on select missions.
so should we call the C. I.A. now?
I cannot tell them that a Division assassin killed one of their people.
especially since we don't exist.
right, so should we hack the C. I.A. now?
I'm happy you're here.
it's just weird having a Division Alpha team as backup, you know?
it's all weird.
I'm not used to playing myself as my cover.
world knows me as Alexandra Udinov, the scandalous Russian heiress.
pretty much blown for undercover work.
we could use your high profile.
especially if it was a distraction.
you wanna run a con on the Hong Kong police.
division's on the line.
we have a critical update on our target and his targets.
targets, plural?
we've confirmed a network of six C. I.A. assets who have infiltrated China's one percent.
they all work in the high-end luxury field.
wine, art, jewelry, cars, and yachts.
we think Martin may be selling them out one by one.
who's he selling to, Chinese intelligence?
that'd be our best guess.
only one of the six is actually in China right now,
he's a car broker.
James is set to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow morning, transporting a vintage car for one of his clients.
we think that he is Martin's next target.
Nikita, I need you to intercept this guy before he has an accident.
what about Michael?
we've got a plan to get him, it's low pro.
wolf team can carry that out.
we need to stop Martin and wrap out of Hong Kong before things get a whole lot worse.
where and when?
he'll be at the port, 0900.
dude, first mission.
is there anyone here who speaks English?
you speak English?
Yes. How can I help you?
my name is Alexandra Udinov, and I'd like to report a theft.
Mr. Sestok, Jack King, McElhinny-White and Associates.
the embassy sent you?
I've already been briefed.
we just want to hear your side of the story.
keep a distance, please.
why'd they pick you?
you guys a big firm or a little firm?
we have six associates, and we are going to do everything we can to get you out of here as soon as possible.
what are they worth?
what does that matter?
they are Alexandrite studs in a 24-karat setting, worth more than your job.
is that enough for you to open a case?
how 'bout this?
they were given to me by my father on my 12th birthday.
and if you know who I am, then you know who my father was, and you would know that the real worth of those earrings is priceless!
RMOTE CONTROL ACTIVE
please write that down, priceless.
okay, we're up.
cameras and phones, and in two shakes we'll have power and utilities.
thank you, Miss Udinov.
is that translation software ready?
Yes, Mandarin or Cantonese?
mandarin. Let's make the call.
inspector, you have a call from headquarters.
who is it?
headquarters. Beijing.
conclude your interview.
give him one minute more.
inspector,
I understand
Kurt Seatok?
yes
this is a very sensitive matter.
the girl that he was found with was also connected...
socially with a member of Politburo.
I can't say which.
I understand.
good.
when the agents arrive, it'll be best if you take him out the back where no one will see.
when they go to move you, I'll protest in the lobby.
it'll speed things along.
I can't leave.
there's a piece of evidence I need to get back.
don't worry about your passport.
it's not the passport.
then what?
Where's Nikita?
all right, be careful now.
one scratch and we're done.
they don't make this paint grade anymore.
I've got eyes on Wright.
get down!
who the
just say thank you.
yes?
I've got another friend I'd like you to meet.
another one so soon?
I thought you were taking a beat.
there's a suspect in custody for murder with the H. K.P. right now.
and he's a spy?
one I can't get to, but you can.
okay, I think we're ready for you guys to roll up and grab Michael.
ops, we may have a problem.
this man
what the hell's going on?
sir, a call just came in.
Sean? Put him through.
no, it's Martin.
he wants to talk to Nikita.
what?
Nikita, we are in a rapidly escalating situation here.
martin just upped the ante.
I want to put us all on the line.
do it.
Hello, Nikita.
I know you from your file, but we haven't been properly introduced.
I'm the guy who's got something you want.
and you're the girl who's got something I want.
so let's make a deal.
since you grabbed Mr. Wright,
I assume you know what I'm trying to get done here in Hong Kong.
Yeah, you work for M. S.S. as a contract killer.
I can't say you've traded up from Division.
no, you got it wrong.
I wrote the contract.
that's what freelance means.
if anything, M.S. S. is working for me.
if I tell them to let Michael go, they will.
if you think I'm gonna trade your target for my partner, you haven't ready my file close enough.
Nah, keep the car guy.
you earned him.
what I want is for you to get out of my way and let finish my job.
you mean killing innocent people?
says the lady sent to kill her own kind.
Martin, this is Ryan Fletcher speaking.
I've been authorized by the President herself to oversee Division.
I can tell you that we no longer cancel agents here.
that was in Percy's day, not mine.
Amanda predicted you'd say that.
you're working with Amanda?
no, but she offered.
maybe two hours after I got the recall order,
I got a message from Amanda on the same encrypted channel.
how the hell?
she must have decrypted the black box.
had the whole roster on it.
she warned us that anyone who obeyed the recall was walking into their own execution.
and you believed her.
why would she lie?
we don't exist.
so who's gonna know we're gone?
Martin, the President has offered amnesty to every single member of Division.
if they work with us to capture the other ones out there, they'll earn their freedom and enough money to resettle.
and you believed her?
I want my money now. I want my freedom now.
this is about more than just you.
just shut up and sit down.
I'm dealing with Nikita on this, not you, tough guy.
I don't work well with a gun to my head or my friend's head either.
that's your problem, too many friends.
Amanda always told us loved ones are liabilities.
is that why you killed Lynn?
I want you out of Hong Kong tonight.
when the other four innocent spies are dead, which may take me a few weeks,
michael will be released and you'll get his location.
or you get stupid, and he gets dead.
right there, sign for prisoner.
Birkhoff, are you still wired in?
shh, shut up, shut up. Shut up, everyone.
Yeah, Mikey, go ahead.
are you still wired into the building?
Yeah, yeah, I can see you, man.
bad times.
I know. So lock me in.
what?
they're about to put me somewhere worse, so lock me in.
this is easy.
martin is using Michael as leverage.
we free Michael, we take away his leverage.
it was easy when the cops had him.
now it's state security.
sleight of hand won't work.
that's not what I had in mind.
What'd you have in mind?
we follow the convoy. T-bone 'em with a Mack truck.
a Mack truck?
we steal one. There's plenty in the city.
Nikita, we are there to stop Martin quietly.
we've already stopped him.
we know who his targets are.
you just call the C. I.A.
and you tell them to pull their people out.
if the C. I.A. thinks their network is compromised, they'll pull everyone they got in China out at once.
yeah?
destroying an operation they likely took years to build.
who cares?
the C. I.A. cares. The President cares.
these are the people that we work for now.
I don't give a damn about the President, Ryan.
I care about Michael. I don't have time for this.
Birkhoff, patch me through to Alex.
Alex, are the heavies still there?
copy that, three armored SUVs.
shut down this channel.
all right, this is what we're gonna do.
she does not make these calls.
first, get my gear. I'm gonna need my scope.
I'm gonna need Birkhoff's code grabber.
got it. - Shut it down now.
meet met at the corner across from the station.
sure thing, boss. - Got it. I'll meet you
listen, man, we gotta talk.
that was not cool.
which part, when I invoked the chain of command or when I held Nikita to it?
you obviously didn't have a problem since you followed the order to cut her off.
that's 'cause I had to.
Why?
because the world was watching.
right and they don't know me yet.
so they need to see that the person responsible for their lives is consistent and dependable.
not responsible for their lives, Ryan.
just the operation.
have you been sleeping in here?
not every night.
just...
just to catch up.
all right. Ahem.
I'm gonna give you a little piece of advice that I realize you don't hear very often in black Ops.
chill.
the world's still gonna be here tomorrow.
unless there's something you're not telling me.
nothing you don't already know.
hold on.
he's making a phone call he doesn't want the cops to hear.
you wanna say hi?
I brought the code grabber for you.
I think the C. I.A. has hacked the Kowloon cops.
they're running around like headless chickens.
this agent of yours must be important.
more than you know, which is why he needs to stay our secret.
he may be the key to getting the others.
I thought you already knew the others.
I do.
so why do you need this man?
just trust me.
no, I can do whatever I want with this guy.
he's in my world now.
that's not how this works.
no, this is how it works.
I am the one allowing you to
if you wanna live, you'll do exactly as I say.
you don't need to talk to him.
onsite Alpha team confirms
Nikita has just taken the M. S.S. station chief hostage.
Yeah, we used to get that look all the time in the old rogue Nikita days, the "Oh, no, she didn't!
you're gonna survive this just fine as long as you get my man back.
I can't.
he's locked in the cell, and the door can't open.
some sort of malfunction.
okay, okay, get him processed and get him out of here.
he's yours.
listen, there are some personal items.
I want them transferred with me.
come on. Let's go.
Alex, he's coming out.
it's 30 yards from the door to the car.
you in position?
you should left Hong Kong.
but it's too late.
you're gonna have to watch him die.
you know what, Martin, you're right.
loved ones are a liability.
it's a good thing I have more than one.
clear.
everything that happens from here on out you can blame on Martin.
his body will be on that roof along with his rifle.
american intelligence, always betraying each other.
you really have to get your house in order.
Yeah, tell me about it.
you know what, don't.
let's go!
give me the gun. - Why?
give me the damn Glock!
where are you going?
to get your engagement ring!
go!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
one down. 29 to go.
dirty 30.
well, at least the first one went down easy.
so you are still Ryan inside there?
Nikita, I am the same guy that you saved multiple times.
I'm still your friend.
but you're also my boss, is that it?
not just yours.
the other agents, they watch what you do.
so when you break the rules
you cut me off in the middle of an Op.
that's what they saw.
Nikita, I can see things happening from operations that you can't see.
and I can see things happening on the ground that you can't see.
and when that happens, I need to make decisions from my gut.
that's how I survived this long. You know that, Ryan.
you are fighting for more than just your survival now.
what does that even mean?
national security?
this nation doesn't even know we exist.
and we have to keep it that way.
disturbing reports out of China.
Yes, ma'am.
should I be worried?
the suspected American operative behind all the chaos can't be identified, he won't be.
Ryan, you convinced me that in a quiet way we could clean up the mess that Percy made.
that is still our mission.
division is necessary to accomplish it.
division is dangerous.
if it is exposed, if I have to explain how I allowed a nest of former criminals turned into assassins to operate
you won't have to.
we'll be more cautious in the future.
good.
because if there is any more exposure on this program
I will have no choice but to send in the troops and burn it to the ground.
my first duty is to protect this nation.
just trust me, okay?
Michael, you don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
it's tradition.
I'm a traditional guy.
I went through hell to get this ring.
we're gonna do this right.
you had me at "give me the damn Glock."
I just want to know where you stand.
do you stand with the powerful, privileged?
those people who look down on us?
or do you stand with your brothers and your sisters on the ground?
third wave is not just an ideal.
it's the solution.
3 billion people living on $2. 50 a day.
that is just fine for this guy,
senator Wallace Herek.
he just wants to protect his power.
you wanna talk about the 1%?
1% of what they spend on weapons in a year could send every single kid to school.
how do we stop this madness?
we have to stand up.
and what do we do when we stand up?
we cripple them, so they can't step on us anymore.
this is Mia. Go secure.
go ahead.
there's gonna be a new attack.
I don't have a target yet.
I need more time.
what do you have right now?
stand by.
FBI. Down on the ground, now!
Mia, what's going on?
get down on the ground.
get down on the ground, now!
this is a priority Op.
we have an agent down.
her name is Mia.
she was infiltrating a domestic terror group.
they call themselves Third Wave.
their goal is to defend the third world against the tyranny of the first world.
FBI raided the safe house in Pittsburgh last night.
Mia was captured.
she's being held at a supermax facility in Virginia.
she's been undercover for a little over a year.
undercover?
for who?
it can't be for us because we're just here to contain rogue agents and shut this place down, right?
Yes. This was a standing mission from before we got here.
a Percy mission?
a good mission.
division is different now.
then why didn't she get the recall order?
she did, over a month ago.
I let her stay under because she requested it.
she requested?
I tracked Third Wave for most of my career at the CIA.
they're run by an unknown operator named Joshua.
part of Mia's assignment was to identify him.
I approved the extension because she was on to something new.
like a new attack.
FBI found evidence at the scene.
they haven't figured out what it means, but I think that I have.
aren't you forgetting something?
Mia's in prison.
which is why I want to know Division's protocol for extracting a captured agent.
we never had one.
Percy's rule was, if you got caught, you did your time.
they knew not to talk, but if they opened their mouths,
roan would show up and silence them.
division's different now.
I'm going in to get her.
you mean federal prison?
Yeah.
I've done it before.
Michael, do you think that you can
look.
just because we're engaged doesn't mean she listens to me more.
so what's the intel on this new attack?
one of the other terrorists they nabbed had a Vimeo account that only Birkhoff was able to find.
it's got home video of a minor league hockey game at an arena in Virginia.
I think they're casing that arena.
we'll check it out.
you can try and stop the girls.
Thanks.
it's not what we signed up for.
Mia is trapped in prison because of us.
division doesn't do active missions.
plenty of other agencies for that.
not as good as us. - Oh, yeah, we're awesome.
you know how tempting this is for someone in power?
sound like you don't trust Ryan.
no. No, it's not Ryan.
it's who he works for.
so you don't trust the government.
I trust what it stands for.
I don't always trust who's running it.
Carver MUNICIPAL ARENA
Selkirk, VIRGINIA
why would domestic terrorists be interested in this place?
college hoops, the occasional minor league game?
I don't know.
not exactly a high-value target.
if Third Wave had the plans, they're definitely up to something.
what are you doing here?
could ask you the same thing.
private security. We don't have to answer.
FBI.
you kind of do.
name's Nick Anson.
I run a security outfit in McLean.
we work protection for Senator Wallace Herek.
the Senator a hockey fan?
he's hosting an event. Welcome home the troops.
tomorrow this place will be filled with returning soldiers and their families.
you may want to up your security.
you know something we don't?
one of our agents does.
we're bringing her in as we speak.
let me put it to you this way.
you're out of your mind.
they have Mia in the enemy combatant wing.
that means no prison yard, no common time.
only time she sees another human being is when a guard shoves her food through a door slat.
Yeah, Sonya already covered all this.
I have the prison schematics. - Thanks.
well, Sonya probably didn't tell you this, but the place is privately run, which means they have proprietary software, which means I haven't had a chance to hack it.
well, maybe Sonya's got time.
I'm confident I could get us eyes inside.
she's confident she can get you eyes inside.
fine.
don't expect me to start popping doors left and right.
you only need to pop one, Birkhoff.
I'm not gonna talk you out of this, am I?
I should, get working on that software.
you know where to find me.
and, congratulations on your engagement.
I am so thrilled for you and Michael. - Thank you.
nice.
talk about her like she's not even in the room.
we have a shorthand. - Shorthand?
Oh, I just thought it was you being an insensitive jerk.
what else do you want for your suicide mission?
fitting. Alex needs a special fitting.
what? No, no, no, no.
I draw the line there. I'm not Amanda.
and this is not America's Next Top Operative.
relax, nerd.
you're perfect for this one.
supermax HOLDING FACILITY
SMOKETREE, VIRGINIA
approaching the security gate.
how are the shoes?
comfy, actually.
I don't miss Christian Louboutin.
maybe a little.
I've got visual on you now, Alex.
you're early. - Yeah, I know.
some of us want to go out after work.
this is for the new girl.
headed for extraction.
extraction. Interesting choice of words.
Nikki, I hope you've been practicing your yoga.
kendo, nerd.
I'm gonna practice it on your head.
we are not here to kill you, Mia.
we're not.
you know what Ryan's offering.
brand new Division, right?
come on home, all is forgiven.
here's a gold watch and a big fat check.
not exactly.
why request to stay undercover?
I was just trying to buy some time.
you don't need to buy anything.
if you come in, you're free.
you're free.
so why all the cloak and drama?
because Division is still secret.
if any of us want to have a life after this, it's gonna have to stay that way.
take off your clothes.
you get to be FBI.
I get a gun?
no.
all right, Nikki?
we've got a visual on the last corridor, and you're clear.
the outdoor cameras don't have adequate coverage.
were you able to get...
I got the guards' radio frequency.
just making sure.
you don't have to. I got it.
yet sometimes you overlook things.
you want to get into this right now?
we've got a live one out here.
I'm sorry, Nikita. I missed him.
I think we're cool.
you'll never stop Third Wave.
Alex, look at me. look at me.
Nikita, do you copy? - Mia has turned.
Alex is down. I repeat, Alex is down!
Alex, stay with us. You're going to be fine.
hang in there, Alex.
Alex, hang in there!
come on!
she went into shock, but she's stable now.
thank you.
all right, let's get that drip going and move out, come on!
I was told that we owned the cameras!
every angle!
he slipped past.
I told you the cameras were inadequate.
slipped pa-- he slipped past you.
Nikita was fully aware, and I was monitoring.
you missed him, and they could have been killed.
you had their communications.
I don't know what the hell kind of ship you were running before we got here
you all did a great job.
get ready for more.
are you all right?
Yeah. What have we got?
a target. Senator Wallace Herek.
he's hosting a small rally to welcome home the troops from Afghanistan.
lots of soldiers and their families.
plenty of symbolism for Third Wave.
Nikita, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left Mia undercover.
if I thought she was unstable, I would have pulled her out.
couldn't have known she would turn.
I put you and Alex in danger, and I put a very well-trained terrorist out into the world.
she won't be for long. What else we got?
her Division phone. It's locked up in FBI evidence.
no one at Quantico's been able to crack it.
when it arrives, get it to Birkhoff.
I'm gonna clean up.
why do you think she turned?
she shot Alex.
I don't care.
third WAVE STAGING AREA
Selkirk, VIRGINIA
Mia?
you made it?
is everything in place?
Yeah, he's-- he's here.
he's upstairs.
I thought we'd lost you.
I had to come back.
our strength is in each other.
you got away from the FBI.
how did you manage that?
there's something I have to tell you.
when you met me, I was undercover
a covert Ops program called Division.
they told me I was protecting the country, but it was a lie.
I thought if I told you before, you'd
do this?
please, Joshua.
I left them.
I left.
you of all people know what it's like.
I killed for them.
journalists, witnesses, whistleblowers, anybody who threatened their power.
I didn't think there was any way to ever make it right, but when you told me your story,
I knew there was a way out for me.
for us.
are they still after you?
they won't stop us.
and I'll do whatever it takes to stop them.
is this it?
all plastic, nondetectable.
I've done the dirty work for powerful men like Senator Herek.
he has to go.
that vest is how I make it right.
I want to be the one.
I'll decide that when the time comes.
this is really sick.
this Joshua guy's like a cross between Che Guevera and Charlie Manson.
we found a bunch of emails on Mia's phone.
he worked her for months.
the guy's a real snake charmer.
Hey, why don't you let them set you up with, like, a morphine drip or something?
that would be great.
send me out on a bender, face-first.
right. Sorry.
see if they mention any rendezvous points, maybe other safe houses?
Yeah.
got most of Ops working on this.
wouldn't hold your breath, though.
Yeah, about that,
Sonya came by to see how I was doing.
whatever she said to you, it is a lie.
okay, everybody thinks they know what happened between us, - but they don't. - I'll tell you what I do know.
I got shot.
just fix it.
search COMPLETE
Shadowbot. Good boy.
what did he find?
I've been trying to find any activity related to Joshua's email.
numbered accounts in the Caymans.
what would Che junior want with an offshore tax haven?
numbered account, nameless account.
Cayman banks are perfect for that.
wait a second.
the accounts are all linked to shell companies.
look at all the property they own.
wait, wait.
now this is the address of the safe house that the FBI raided.
and this place, can you map that?
Carver Municipal Arena
that's 6 miles from the arena.
damn it, we're pinned down here.
all right, guys, most of them are downstairs, but infrared's reading three heat blooms up top.
Where's Mia?
where is she?
let him go, or we all die.
it's armed.
you pull your trigger,
I pull mine.
I hope you're a good shot.
you hit the gel in that vest, and boom.
go, Joshua.
go!
how fast do you think Joshua can run?
you want to save him?
he won't even make it to the stairs.
you lied to me. You're gonna regret that.
your life is a lie.
division is a lie.
I killed for Division. Innocent blood on my hands.
you're preaching to the choir, honey.
I didn't think that there was any way to make it right until one person stood up.
who?
Joshua?
you.
you were supposed to tear that place down.
you kept it running!
division is different now.
stop!
stop.
Why? We're already dead, right?
no.
I'm willing to die for what I believe in.
are you willing to die for Division?
are you?
I can't believe she was really gonna do it.
Yeah.
something happened, Alex.
I went there to kill this crazy bitch, and I found myself looking in a mirror.
she asked me if I was willing to die for Division.
I didn't have an answer.
Nikita, that's because you've spent so much time - trying to take this place down- - exactly.
and in that time, no one thought I could be stopped because they thought I was stronger or faster.
it had nothing to do with that.
then what was it?
I was committed.
I was more committed than my enemies.
I believed.
if I lose that
so he came at me kind of like this.
that's silat.
a little slow.
that's what happens when you get engaged.
it softens you up.
right.
so a lot of MMA fighters use silat, don't they?
so do Seals.
Yeah, mostly Seals.
you think this Joshua guy used to be one?
not sure.
his group of rebels?
they had a lot of moves.
they came at me two-by-two in controlled bursts.
Yeah, rebels usually just spray.
well, maybe Mr. Joshua taught them a few things.
well, if he's a Seal, he's gonna be tough to track.
I could check with the cappy, though, see if he knows something.
in the meantime...
leaving the knife-fighting up to the pros.
and I'm not even wearing my ring yet.
you gotta see this.
joshua has got a money trail that winds all over the planet.
numbered accounts in the Caymans, Liechtenstein.
michael and Sean are working an angle that he's ex-military.
I've seen it before.
a lot of these guys, they go native, find a cause, take up arms.
how is he getting his money?
I don't know, but it's not very third world of him.
Mia's traded one lie for another.
she has no idea.
I talked to Herek's people.
you and Michael will attend the rally as FBI.
full Alpha support.
if Mia shows up, we take her out.
no.
mission hasn't changed. Same as the prison.
we find her, we bring her in alive.
okay, the Senator and soldiers are gathering here.
main floor. It's big, it's wide, super-high ceilings.
but I have come up with a way for you to keep eyes on everything at all times.
incredibly awesome, and I designed it myself.
we're thrilled for you, Birkhoff.
where is it?
it's right there.
cute toy.
ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Birkhoff unmanned tactical robot.
the B.U.T.R?
the "butter,"
cause it's slick like that.
gross.
Where's my toy?
all right, keep your pants on.
it's right here.
all right.
looks like you're ordinary standard baton, right?
not quite.
Electro-muscular disruption, kids.
a targeted shock at just the right voltage shouldn't set off the vest.
you're positive?
Yeah.
like, 97%.
out of the question. We are not cancelling.
I do not bow down to terrorists.
we thought you might say that.
that's why the Bureau is here.
look, this Joshua character is all talk.
besides, what are we dealing with?
a bunch of hipsters who read too many books in college, right?
they're very determined.
well, that's why I've got Nick and his team here.
give these folks whatever they need.
of course.
security post is up top.
I'll work with your team up there, and Nikita and the others will work the floor.
do you really think they'll make a try?
let's hope we're wrong.
what kind of support do we have down there?
besides my people, we've got a few cameras in some corridors, but we're gonna need more eyes.
we've got it covered.
damn straight you do, biz-natch.
we now have liftoff on the maiden voyage of the U. S.S. Butter.
how you feeling?
Hey, just waiting for them to change my bandage.
you should be at the arena.
Yeah, well, you were with me when I was wounded,
I figured I'd do the same.
any luck tracking Joshua?
my Seal contacts came up empty.
what's that?
she really got to Nikita.
never seen her question herself like that.
she's not the only one.
what are we doing here, Alex?
chasing monsters?
monsters that are only gonna be replaced as soon as we take them out.
I don't believe that.
well, what do you believe?
cause if you're here for Nikita,
I'm not sure that's such a good idea, especially if she's having doubts.
you had a life before all this.
you could have it again.
you see this woman?
this woman threw her out a window, and she still wants to save her.
you want to know what I believe in?
what about you?
you were never really Division in the first place.
why are you still here?
well, I guess some things are worth fighting for.
this is pointless.
stealth approach. Think, think.
I told you I was willing to die.
I'm not the only one.
hello everyone, and welcome all to America Comes Home.
who's wearing the vest?
who?
you talk about the things Division made you do.
how's killing innocents gonna fix that?
herek and his shock troops are the target.
joshua said they're the ones who have to pay.
you can't even see who he really is.
he fights for those who can't fight for themselves.
no, Mia, no!
he fights for himself.
he's got offshore accounts.
he's lining his pockets. It's Percy all over again.
you're lying. - I can prove it.
joshua said you would try and tear him down, but he knows.
he's just like us.
when he was Delta, he spread murder and fear, and he figured out a way to stop it.
joshua knows.
Birkhoff, get me Alex.
we were wrong.
he's special Ops. He's not a Seal.
deltas fall under J. S.O. C. operational control, so as long as Birkhoff got us into the right personnel servers, facial recog should
better known as Major Travis Ryerson, recruited out of the 75th Ranger regiment.
retired?
09.
did a couple of joint Ops with the Seals.
that's where he learned his little ka-bar move.
wait a second. - What is it?
damn.
Joshua's got a partner.
I'm getting on a chopper.
all right, I'll get this to Michael right now.
tell the Senator we're five away, and get teams one and two in position.
Michael, something's coming through on your tablet.
Hey, man. What's up?
well, I just got some intel.
it appears that Joshua is actually Travis Ryerson.
he's ex-Delta, two tours in Iraq, two more in Afghanistan.
but you already knew that.
cause you were in the same unit.
ryerson?
I haven't seen that guy since he told me he wasn't gonna re-up.
but Third Wave?
you think he went native or something?
you tell me.
I gotta get this out to my guys.
what do you see?
no tangos in sight. - Stay on it.
how's the new Division working out for you?
look, you're right.
I didn't want to keep Division going.
but it was the only way to
to what?
keep the bastards happy?
to save people like us.
Mia, I've read your file.
I know the things you've done.
killing this many people?
that's a rabbit hole you don't wanna go down.
where are you?
after Anson. - Anson?
he's partnered up with Joshua.
they were in the same unit during the war.
my guess-- they're drumming up clients.
create an enemy force, charge by the hour to defend against 'em.
cowboys and Indians.
joshua puts on the war paint, attacks the town.
Anson wears the badge.
that explains Joshua's offshore accounts.
Michael, can you get me hard proof?
not yet. But I will.
good,'cause I'm gonna need it.
Birkhoff, I think I lost him.
I think he's in the east corridor, end of the rafters.
there's an elevator through there.
he just went down six floors. You'll never catch him.
he's probably headed to Joshua.
is there any way we can listen in?
afraid not.
it's all service tunnels down there.
nothing to hack into.- Birkhoff
best I can do is guide you.
Seymour. - Hang on.
I'm sorry. What is it?
route Butter's signal through the arena Wi-Fi so it still transmits.
transmits where?
you don't have it in you anymore.
we're in the middle of the operation.
opsec is blown.
just slow down, okay? - They know!
about us, probably about the accounts.
I told you we couldn't pull this off with these bastards on-site.
everything was just fine until you bitched out.
Trav, you're not hearing me.
we were supposed to save the day, Nick, remember?
the bomb gets averted, the Senator gets saved, and then all of those new clients, they just start lining up. But you couldn't swing that!
they got us.
they are spooks, okay?
we have end-run jokers like...
Nikki, we got 'em.
on your phone.
the target stays the same.
the vector changes.
we kidnap the Senator.
kidnap?
and ransom.
Yeah, but there goes the business.
how do you figure?
cause no one's gonna hire a firm that lost a Senator on its watch.
unless...
unless after the ransom's paid, they find Third Wave's H. Q. and kill them all.
all right, let's do this.
boom time is in six minutes. -Hey, wait.
you're still gonna blow the vest?
Oh, yeah, it'd be a nice distraction.
my God.
what have I done?
I'd like to introduce our distinguished guest.
he's been a great champion to our country, and of all you fine men and women gathered here today.
salvador's the bomber. He's down there.
if he sees me, he'll blow the vest.
he trusts you. - I'll stop him.
there's just two other spotters we've gotta take out first.
we're not killing anyone.
looks like a great turnout.
you ready to rock?
let's do it.
senator Wally Herek!
not another step!
you really think you can take us both?
Oh, I know I can. But I don't have to.
on your knees.
knife!
Oh, not this time.
you two have I. D.s?
salvador, you can't do this.
don't try and stop me.
Oh, my God, he's got a bomb!
No!
don't!
you're gonna be okay.
Oh, I need a medic. We need a medic!
we need a medic!
it's okay.
thank you.
thank you.
it's not right.
soldiers get a flag draped across their coffin.
CIA's got a wall of stars.
division just deletes you.
it's hard to make a memorial to someone who doesn't exist.
look, I know you're under a lot of pressure to deliver.
but you've gotta promise me one thing, Fletch.
no more active missions.
okay?
no more.
promise.
and maybe we could, get rid of all this paper on your desk.
you got a problem with the current century?
well, you...
will you just cut me some slack?
please? Okay, I'm still trying to...
figure this out.
me too.
yeah?
Yeah.
I know that we're here to take down the worst of the worst,
I just thought that maybe we could save more of them.
you know, Mia died a hero because of you.
you did save her.
can I help you now?
that's a lot of paper.
got a shredder?
there's a system here, all right?
you're the only person in the building...
let's be honest, sacrifice is for losers.
I mean, Martyrdom is what it is.
it's exciting.
your family's proud of you, also sad.
but you're not around to reap the rewards, unless we're talking about the afterlife, which, come on, big roll of the dice.
I mean, sure, there could be 77 virgins waiting for you.
there could also be one 77-year-old virgins.
you never know.
we're not interested in suicide.
either am I.
that's why I say live longer, stay remote.
with the Mark 2 Longarm, you can resolve your differences from the comfort of your living room, remote target from anywhere in the world with an optional Sat upgrade.
on this model, we've sacrificed nothing, because sacrifice is for losers.
and what does that make you, Cyrus
what's this？
come on, you guys didn't think you were the only ones bidding on this, did you
that's exactly what you told us.
you're right. Shoot her.
I don't even have a gun.
now I do.
me too.
nice to finally meet you, by the way.
big fan. Let's go back to Division.
I'll get you an autograph after I bring you in alive.
Thanks.
but right now I'm a little more concerned about you.
that's a Glock 17, ten box mags, sights are off
classic choice
whereas this is a state-of-the-art, air-cooled, 1,200-round per minute,
seven six two armor-piercing discarding sabot with an automated reload.
you sold one to Wade. He used it on us.
damn it.
you know, it's guys like that that give us rogue agents a bad name.
you're the one currently pointing an assault cannon at my fiancee.
fiancee
Congralations
I walk, he lives. You keep the Longarm.
think of it as a wedding present
mazel tov and all that.
Oh, I don't know.
honey, wasn't there a problem with the override systems thing
Yes, yes, Birkhoff found it kind of easy to hack.
how about that autograph
how about that wedding present
anything you want, name it.
Uzbekista president suddenly dies
this is her handiwork, her latest triumph.
I still think you should let me kill her.
death would be a mercy, Anne.
andalusia, SPAI
she doesn't deserve mercy.
what does she deserve, then
Nikita thinks she can run Division without selling her soul.
she's wrong.
she's going to have to sacrifice more than she could ever imagine.
that is the lesson she needs to learn.
how will she learn it
the same way she's learned everything she knows
I teach her.
when?
if one is patient, the opportunity will always present itself.
perhaps sooner than anticipated.
Nikita returned from Mission-0930
there it is.
is the mole sending another message
they're not done yet.
will learn more
can we piggyback our trace to Amanda's location
I'm trying.
it keeps getting lost in dark space.
okay, okay, just try and isolate the terminal they're sending from.
Rerouted... multiple times.
son of a bitch. How does he keep doing this
how do you know it's a he
okay, daughter of a bitch.
whoever it is, they're in the building right now.
I got to go tell Nikki.
you keep trying to trace the source terminal.
do we have a clear path to interrogation
Yeah, no one's going to see you.
so what about the mole hunt - We're closing in.
mole is active.
he knows you're back, but not where you went or who you got.
who do you got, by the way
Birkhoff, hey, how did you manage to hack the Longarm
you guys busted your ass to find this guy, the gun guy
he knows where Amanda is.
I told you, I haven't seen Amanda in years.
why do you want her so bad
she declared war on us.
VZ58 super shorties with modifications.
your modifications.
we recovered these on a raid of Amanda's safe house in Luxembourg.
once I figured out that you sold them to her,
I put you at the top of our list.
I made a list
Yeah, when you cut out your tracker and refused to return to Division.
Percy put me into the world to be his guy who could get anything
special orders, untraceable gear, stuff that you could drop in the field that wouldn't point back to Division.
the world was my office
champagne, yachts, and women.
so excuse me for not immediately reporting back to the underground bunker in New Jersey when so commanded.
my heart breaks for you. It really does.
but if you ever want to see the sun again, you're gonna tell me exactly what I want to know.
I like the sun.
Amanda-- you supply her.
I want to know where you're supplying her next and when.
she moves around.
I deal mostly with her boyfriend now
russian guy.
always making special orders.
some of the stuff I can't get, some I can.
I'm on the trail of a next-gen weapon right now.
I was gonna pick it up this week in the Caribbean
St. Lucia.
and when you get it - I contact Ari.
he tells me where to meet.
you grab him, you get to dragon lady.
and why do I smell a catch 'Cause there is one.
not a good idea.
you just caught this guy.
I know, but this is how we get Amanda.
listen, you're gonna love it.
this is what Cyrus is buying-- Sideswipe.
it's a missile jammer.
actually, it's a multispectral array.
it can trick anything you shoot at it, from an RPG to a Sidewinder.
it jams missiles.
and other stuff.
look, check it out.
the Pentagon slipped a prototype to the Egyptian army for the war on terror.
but this man,
general Tariq Rafat, has fled the Egyptian army, and he's taken the Sideswipe with him.
he's on his way to St. Lucia to sell it to Cyrus.
what's Cyrus want with it
profit. Resell it to Ari Tasarov.
what's Ari want with it - More profit.
he plans to resell it to his old contacts in Russian defense.
which would put their helicopters on par with ours - in a heartbeat. - It'll never get that far.
we're gonna run a tight screen on Cyrus at the sale.
you get Sideswipe, we get Ari, but, you know, most importantly...
we get Amanda.
but first, we've got to put this snake back in the pit and give him the real tech
risk it falling into the wrong hands.
Ryan, it's already in the wrong hands.
Amanda's got a mole in here. She's hunting me.
I want her first.
the only way to get to her is through Ari.
those two are attached at the hip.
okay, Cyrus, let's make a deal.
ten men for surveillance
I need it.
well, I need a security detail.
don't be unreasonable.
when it comes to Nikita, I can be very unreasonable.
look what happened in Luxembourg.
you happened in Luxembourg.
your obsession with Nikita almost killed both of us, and now I have to recoup our losses.
all you care about is money. - Open your eyes, Amanda.
our soldiers don't work for free.
they're hired with the money from the deals I made, money that is meant to build something.
after this deal, you'll have all the resources you could ever need.
sometimes to get what you want, you have to make sacrifices.
you know, this tracker thing really ruins my Bikini line.
michael thought you might try to run when we get to St. Lucia.
so paranoid. - I know.
I told him to relax, everything's under control.
what the hell was that
I upgraded your tracker with a little voltage spike to the sciatic nerve.
makes running a little bit ouch.
I thought torture was Amanda's thing.
your lucky you didn't have one of Amanda's trackers.
they were paired with kill chips
drop an agent like that if they got out of line.
we deactivated them, every last one of them.
you really think you can turn Division around, don't you
and you don't think I can
this place was designed to do some very bad things and keep 'em secret.
old habits die hard.
you feel weak.
and you're angry because you feel weak.
you have a right to feel that way.
you're an addict.
you're not the only one in Division, which is why we do random searches.
oxycodone from medical.
I didn't have any.
but you wanted to.
you will always want to.
and sometimes that need will become rage.
you can use that, Alex.
take it easy on that arm.
it's not 100% yet.
I'm fine.
you don't look fine.
have you heard from Sean
Michael, do you really want to talk to me about boys
no.
I'm just anxious to get back out there, that's all.
Yeah, well, don't be too anxious.
jet leaves in 20.
Sobelexs
St. LUCIA
so how many guys does the general usually roll with
tariq
four or five guys since they have the Sideswipe.
shouldn't be too much trouble, once they see how relaxed I am chilling with my lady.
we got a couple minutes to kill...
at least.
was that necessary
for Michael, it was.
he's got your head in a rifle scope right now.
easy there, Romeo.
can you believe this guy
I got two suits taking positions on the rooftop of the pavilion.
tariq must be close.
they're packing sidearms, maybe a subgun.
I don't know if they've got vests, but maybe we should switch to A. P. rounds.
Alex, we knew they'd be packing.
we're not here to start a fight.
something wrong
just keep to your target.
you know, you've been on edge ever since we got off the plane.
if you want to talk about it, maybe I could
save me
help.
why do guys think they always need to fix or save or help
look, I have no trouble with you getting Amanda or whatever you want, as long as I get what I want.
and what do you want
after we get the Sideswipe and we get Ari's location, you let me vanish.
give me one good reason.
because you owe me.
Oh, this should be good.
how do I owe you, Cyrus
you think you're the only person that can track someone through their weapons
when you went rogue and declared war on Percy, you didn't just pick up a 12-gauge from Big 5.
that Beretta A. R.X. with the ACOG scope and modified stock for your petite frame
I tracked that particular cocktail through the back channels designed to make it untraceable and it led me to...
your fabulous loft in Chelsea.
ice pad, by the way.
my favorite lair of yours, by far.
that A. R.X. I got from Travis in, what, June 2010
you're telling me you knew where I was the whole time
the dealer's name was Trevor.
it was July, and I'm telling you
I knew where you were the whole time, and I never told a soul.
Why?
upstairs
it's go time.
Sammy, have you seen Birkhoff
he's not in his club den.
no, I was just there.
can I ask you something
have you heard this rumor about a mole
what rumor?
just whispers.
I thought maybe you heard something from the round table.
the round table
you know, Camelot...
Nikita's inner circle.
they always seem to know more than they're telling us.
since you're dating Birkhoff, I thought maybe you heard
how did you know I was dating Birkhoff
come on, you know it's hard to keep secrets in here.
that's Division. Someone's always watching.
whoever it is, they're in the building right now.
now, now, boys, no need to get paranoid.
we're buying goodies today, not carrying them.
he's clean.
general, how's that Rhino working out for you
Oh, I love it.
I plan to order a few more from you.
make my day.
baby, you got to try this out. I'm gonna get you one.
no, I'm good. I don't like guns.
this gun you're gonna love. Trust me.
let's get down to business.
we never fully settled on a price.
I think that's fair.
nice. Mind if I try?
I don't have a missile for you to jam, but go ahead.
signal's blocked.
connecting lost
so is Cyrus' tracker.
signal interference
where the hell are you guys
that's not good.
all good
one problem.
she's an Interpol agent.
I'm under duress, and this meeting's about to get busted right now.
you son of a-- - Take her!
no.
good luck.
he's down!
what the hell are you
come on.
come on! Come on!
he has the Sideswipe.
and we don't have him.
nice place you got here...
very medieval.
actually, it was rebuilt after the second World War.
the catacombs below
they date back to the Crusades...
when blacksmiths were forging the blades of the holy wars.
I guess back then my business was God's business.
Amen.
we heard there was some trouble in St. Lucia.
anything we should be worried about it unless you're an Egyptian national wanted for war crimes.
it was only a matter of time before Interpol caught up with Tariq.
excellent work, Cyrus.
Nikita returned 2200-from Caribbean.
ANDALUSIR, SPAIN
Cyrus' tracker is back online.
must have handed over the Sideswipe to Ari.
where is he
southern Spain.
your payment.
it's all there.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have a plane waiting.
Sideswipe, I hardly knew you.
how long will you be gone, dear
not long at all.
I don't mean to impose, but do you mind if I get out of these clothes - It's been a long trip. - Down the hall.
okay, we can have a team out there in under seven hours.
forget it--he won't be there for more than one.
he's probably cutting out his tracker as we speak.
so we didn't get Tasarov.
he got the Sideswipe.
he's about to deliver it God-knows-where, and Cyrus is out in the wind.
we know where they met. We know Ari is in Spain.
Amanda's probably there too.
let's go now. - They won't be there.
they'll move on after Cyrus warns them.
he's team Amanda, remember.
no, he's team Cyrus. He made that very clear.
look, I have no problem with you getting Amanda or whatever you want, as long as I get what I want.
well, he left us with zero.
just a gun.
this gun you're gonna love.
trust me.
wait a minute.
what is it
son of a...
you get what you want,
I get what I want.
Krilov Industries.
you owe me twice. What does that mean
Ari Krilovnu owe me twice!
Krilov, where is that
Ari's headed to Romania.
we grab him-- he will lead us to Amanda.
feeling better
like new, thanks. But I better get going.
so soon
well, you know how this business is.
got to keep moving
I can smell her on you.
I selected that perfume for Nikita years ago.
I know a lot of women.
I'm only interested in one.
all right, easy, easy.
you don't need that.
we're all friends here.
Nikita grabbed me a couple days ago.
she tried to edge in on my deal and get Sideswipe.
I shook her and came straight here.
then why not tell us that when you arrived
why lie
you get Sideswipe, I get paid.
the rest is just noise.
see, I don't think so.
I think you're protecting her.
I know you, Cyrus.
remember our sessions
you used to talk about your father
the sad tale of the police officer charged with corruption.
rings a bell.
he was innocent, and everyone knew it.
but he still lost his badge and drank himself to death.
it must have been so sad for a little boy to watch someone he loved suffer so much.
I got over my issues.
you should try it sometime.
see, I used to think that this experience explained your aggressive neutrality.
no good deed goes unpunished,
wait, wait
I told her.
she knows about Romania.
she knows about Ari's deal.
I think deep down you're more like your father than you want to admit.
I can see it.
there's good in you, and I'm betting Nikita saw it too.
but, now, this is something I can work with.
you see, Anne,
I told you an opportunity would present itself.
the factory Cyrus told us about is abandoned, which means it's gonna be easier to raid, but we need to grab Ari and the Sideswipe before the Russians get there.
I can get an Alpha team in there.
Michael, you'll have to guard that door.
Alex, we'll need you on the roof.
got it.
Birkhoff, the mole cannot get wind of this.
where are you on the hunt
tracking the source has been tough.
I did solve a big piece of the puzzle, though.
what?
the messages aren't being sent in real time.
they're on a 30-minute delay.
guys, we just intercepted a video call on our private relay.
it's Amanda. Start a trace.
futile trace is already in process.
Hello, Nikita.
I'm sorry I missed you in Luxembourg, but I had urgent business elsewhere.
Oh, no doubt.
you needed to find some rat trap to hole up in.
my new home is quite comfortable--thank you.
in fact, I have my very first houseguest right here
a friend of yours.
say hello to Cyrus.
he's no friend of mine.
Cyrus has been quite reticent when it comes to you, specifically what you two talked about back in Division.
it wasn't really that interesting.
then this should be easy.
you tell me what Cyrus is holding back, and I give him the gift of a quick death, or I find out the truth my way
your choice.
do me a favor, Amanda.
keep those ropes tight. He's slippery.
you could've told her something false and spared him the pain.
that pain is gonna buy him time.
I'm going after him. Where
tracker says he's still in Spain--Andalucia.
that's probably where Amanda is.
correction-- that's where Amanda's trap is.
she's luring you there.
that's why she kept his tracker online.
Michael, I owe him. - He made his choices.
I know. That's why I got to go get him.
Nikita, you know I can't authorize this.
I won't stop you, but I can't send a team with you.
Yeah, I know. I'm going alone.
no, you're not.
okay, you can't be in Spain and Romania at the same time.
your plan to get Ari and the Sideswipe is good.
you designed it.
who's gonna carry it out --I'll do it.
I can prepare a team, be wheels up in an hour.
I am just dying to say hello to Ari.
all right.
it's decided.
let's do it.
I know. I'll make sure they're covered
both of them.
all right, all right, all right.
filter program on.
server protocols active.
flux capacitor fluxing.
ready.
let's see your moley ass get out of this one.
got ya!
unauthorized traffic
Oh, yeah.
tracing source terminal
where have you been
I am hot on the mole.
turns out they were sending messages on a 30-minute delay.
what about the source terminal
that has been a little bit trickier.
using a new filter program that hunts down rerouting algorithms.
found the last relay, but it didn't...
didn't find the source yet.
where was the relay
terminal on sublevel nine.
it just said...
Nikita has left. Destination unknown.
well, we should investigate that terminal and see what we can find.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll,-- I'll go down there with you.
don't let anyone see you in transit, just to be safe.
Nikita has left. Destination unknown.
I bet I know where she's headed.
she's on her way to rescue you.
Nikita doesn't care about me.
disagree, but that's why we test.
car's ready.
we going somewhere
goodbye, Cyrus.
it's just up there.
is this the terminal the mole used
you tell me.
how long
since I've been here
please.
since we were together
is that why we were together
don't.
was any of it real, what happened between us
any of it
take one more step, and I will kill you.
then do it.
I'm dead anyway.
Amanda--she reactivated my kill chip.
on my way home to my apartment three weeks ago, a van pulled up, and this woman grabbed me
Anne, she was a cleaner.
they threw me in the back of the van and
stop. Stop it! Stop!
I don't believe you.
she showed me the uplink.
Amanda's not here.
so she can't know if you asked for help, which you never did.
there's someone else inside.
she told me there was someone else and that they'd be watching.
and in Division, there's always someone watching.
you can't know that's true.
I can't know that it isn't.
she has me restricted.
I have to send her an update every two hours.
I haven't slept the night in weeks.
if I even walk in the direction of medical, which Amanda gas-bombed as a warning to me, her spy will see and tell her, and she will trigger the chip, and I will drop
okay, okay, all right.
all right.
I wanted to tell you.
I was so scared.
I was scared that they would see it on my face, and they would know.
okay.
all right.
we can beat this.
when my people get back from overseas
no. - Yes.
I'm gonna fill them in quietly, yes.
o, you can't tell anyone. It could be anyone.
it's not Nikita, okay It's not Michael or Alex.
how do you know - I know.
you don't know! You don't know!
okay, all right. You need to calm down.
if there is another spy, they can't see you like this.
they can't know anything's wrong.
they have to think you're still with the program.
when do you have to send your next update --12 minutes.
all right, we give them something
something true but low value.
that'll buy us some time.
and then we will figure a way out of this.
no, we're in Spain. She is in Romania.
Yeah, that's right. Do you have the coordinates.
no, no, trust me. Thank you.
all good. - Let's hope so.
you. - I will be.
Hey, whatever happens, I'm really glad you're here.
please, you know I love Spain.
I know I pushed too hard on this.
all right, then do me one favor.
if Amanda really is here, push harder.
this time, kill the bitch.
where is she
she's gone.
you really shouldn't have come for me.
how's it wired-- pressure plates
no. No, it's remote.
she wanted to be the one.
so glad you could make it.
and I see you've brought your fiance
what a nice surprise. Congratulations, you two.
we're not here to chat.
well, then let's start the lesson, shall we
if we get any closer, we're in the blast radius.
Nikita, just go. Go!
there's no way to disarm the bomb on site.
what's the point of a test I can't pass
