someone cut himself moving...
well, that's all we're talking about.
save yourself some money. Go with the 10-footer.
I can't let myself think about this.
I've just got to move the kids.
actually, I think I'll go with the 14-footer.
okay, let's, uh, write you up.
we're gonna get a much better place.
what do you think, closer to the park or the beach?
Hello?
no annoying neighbors.
Hey, Dex.
brought your mail. - Thanks.
wow, look at Harrison.
boy, he's just getting bigger every day.
Hey, look, Dex, um...
you know, we haven't had a chance to talk.
but I just... I wanted to let you know how sorry I am about everything.
Thanks.
have they caught the trinity killer yet or...
no.
man, if I could just get my hands on him.
I can only imagine.
Hey, listen, you know, I know we've had our differences, but, you know, I'm a single dad.
I mean, I know the ropes, so if you need any help... - No, I'm good.
cause, you know, you gotta give up a lot.
I mean, I actually have a pretty decent career going, you know.
but I had to turn down some major job offers so I could just work at home and just, you know, be there for those kids.
good for you.
I mean, forget about any free time.
or any life of your own, really.
I mean, you just, you know, you have to be there.
right? Every morning. Every evening.
every weekend.
you ready to do that, Dex, for the kids?
Yes, Elliot, I'm ready to do that.
for the kids.
here, let me... - No! I got it.
okay, well...
but you know what? It works out.
it really does, you know.
I mean, yeah, you have to give up your life and all, but, uh...You know what?
you just... you live for those kids, and...It's satisfying.
excuse me. - Yeah.
I'll be a good father. Everyone makes sacrifices.
I can too.
focus on the kids.
wow, I didn't know you were gonna bring so much.
you can just put that...
right there is great.
I emptied the refrigerator.
someone left another cake at the door.
I just ate a whole tuna casserole to make room in the apartment.
Cody, is is a good job for you.
wanna help me unload the food?
okay.
Wow. You sure do have a lot of beer, aunt Deb.
people just keep bringing it.
this is all you brought?
uh, well, we're a little short on space.
you didn't even bring the right clothes.
this was my reject stuff.
I can't wear any of this to school.
astor, come on. No one's gonna notice you.
honey, would you hold the baby?
come here. - Cody.
why don't you help us carry the last load in, Hmm?
I like it here. It's like camping.
exactly.
boys are easier.
it doesn't matter how much I love my children, I'm still a creature of the night.
can't sleep either?
the blood probably means nothing.
someone cut their finger while moving.
but I won't be able to put it out of my mind until I know for sure.
someone did a quick cleanup job, but forgot to wash the door.
Yeah, it's pretty.
I know.
but not the story it tells.
once upon a time, an evil green ogre left a circular spatter at three feet high, consistent with blunt force trauma...
which seems to indicate the handsome young prince was hit while on his knees, at least two or three times.
or the princess was on her knees.
small hands.
female.
I thought the kids were your number one responsibility.
they are. - But here you are...
in the middle of the night.
it's not that simple.
it never is.
it's like when you get on a plane.
they tell you if the oxygen masks come down to put yours on first before helping the kids.
I have to take care of my own needs too.
otherwise, I risk spinning out of control.
that's not good for anyone.
I'm not just saying this for the sake of the kids, Dex, but for you.
they're not only your responsibility.
they're your salvation.
I have to give him a bottle.
no reason a truck rental agency would put any serious safeguards on their records.
the truck was most recently rented to Boyd Fowler.
Boyd seems to have listed his address as the department of sanitation.
no home address.
Miami-Dade county department of sanitation, division of dead animal pickup, meaning the blood belongs to an animal.
but what about those little hand prints?
two lines.
human.
well, well, well. What do we got here?
raccoon.
you call this in? - Yeah, I did.
I was driving down the road, and...I saw it. Kind of creeps me out.
you're probably used to seeing dead things, though, huh?
can't say I ever get used to it.
I don't usually come this way, but I'm in the middle of moving to a new place.
it's a hassle, huh? Moving?
I wouldn't know. - No?
lived in the same house for over 20 years.
so why did you rent a moving van?
hello there, bandit.
this don't look right.
what do you mean?
well, usually, you find a dead animal in the road, it means he was hit by a car.
but there's no tire marks or blood on the asphalt.
this raccoon was killed someplace else and dropped here.
he's c. S.I.-ing me.
he's got defensive wounds on his paws.
little guy put up quite a struggle.
Alrighty then.
he's definitely peculiar.
but I guess the best and brightest don't typically get into dead animal pickup.
just so you know, okay?
what do we got?
we got a female victim.
part of a female victim.
part? - We got a head.
just a head?
Yeah.
decapitation. Probably some kind of drug killing.
nice.
let me ask you a question, hypothetical.
say a newly-married person accidentally discovers that his or her new spouse has a savings account with a lot of money.
is that something that one should expect to share?
fuck, no. That's your money.
you tell the lieutenant to keep her fuckin' hands off it.
take me to the head. - All right.
she was still alive when they cut her head off.
excision of eyes and tongue was done post-mortem.
that's considerate of them.
you were right.
it's just a head.
unless they buried her standing up.
what are you doing?
just trying to help you. Looking a little ragged.
I'm exhausted.
there are five people in my tiny apartment.
I shared a bed with astor last night, and she kicked me all night long.
you know, you're welcome to crash at my place, if you want.
uh, no thanks, Detective.
okay.
it looks like Santa muerte.
what?
Santa muerte, the cult. "Saint death.
Yeah, I know what it is, but why do you say that?
well, the missing eyes and tongue were meant to send a message.
you didn't see anything, you're not gonna say anything.
who are you?
officer manzon. Cira.
the golden candles mean money.
the icons, I don't know. There's so many now.
might need an expert on it.
and you know all of this because... - It's my neighborhood.
and if it is Santa muerte...
they used a machete on her.
okay, well, we'll keep that in mind.
but this park is a local drug hangout, and drug cartels like to cut heads off.
so we might follow that lead. - Of course.
hey...
we found the body on the other end of the park, under the bushes, no I. D.
gotta canvass the neighborhood, start asking questions.
no one will talk. They're too afraid.
well, we still ask, officer.
helping your children cope with grief.
grandpa's gone to heaven.
saying good-bye to Fluffy.
but nothing on "mommy bled out in a bathtub.
Boyd Fowler, you have a prison record.
assault with a deadly weapon.
18 months at okeechobee.
you said you lived in a house, but there are no mortgage records in your name.
in the same house for over 20 years.
you inherited it from your parents, rich and Elsie Fowler in opa-locka.
Hey.
how was your day?
a whole afternoon getting doors shut in my face.
sorry.
you?
okay.
we finished Laguerta's caserola de camarones and Masuka's chocolate lava cake, and astor told me she hated living here.
they're both asleep in the bed.
looking at apartments.
so it's everything as usual.
they're seeing a grief counselor tomorrow.
maybe that'll help.
still, even after...
what?
you're gonna be a single dad raising three kids.
gonna be hard.
Rita was a great mom.
there's nothing I can do to make up for that.
but I'm gonna have to try.
well, I'll be here.
you can count on me.
the kids'll be okay.
know that place. It's near the station.
they have an open house tomorrow. Maybe I'll check it out for you.
great.
you want the couch tonight? - No, you take it.
Hey. - Hi.
glad you called.
Hey, fuck puddle. What are you doing?
just giving you a kiss hello.
I-I came over here to sleep, not to have your fat little sausage fingers all over me.
there's no room for me at my own place.
unless I want to curl up inside a fuckin' toaster oven.
I'm trying so hard to be a good sister, 'cause fuck knows, Dexter's always been the best brother.
but...it is fucking exhausting.
I'm sure.
well, look, you're, uh, welcome to stay here for as long as you want, whenever you want.
and I promise to keep my fat little sausage fingers off you.
you better.
how's your brother? - You know.
I heard the FBI interview went well. I mean, that must be a load off.
why would that be a load off?
nothin'. Never mind.
they're looking for someone named Kyle Butler who's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.
they think if they can find him, then he can lead them to Mitchell.
but they can't find him?
well, not yet.
they're having sketches done. They're trying to get a positive I. D.
Kyle Butler. Why does that name sound so familiar?
well, that's the weird thing. We worked that case, remember?
a dead Kyle Butler.
right, he got his head smashed in.
went unsolved.
any connection? - I don't know.
I'm sure the FBI will find a way to fuck it up.
will you get the lights?
Yes, ma'am.
what do you want to do for the next batch?
Mickey mouse, silver dollar?
great big ones? - Triangles.
a challenge.
Dexter's making triangle pancakes.
actually, they're more freeform.
wanna set the table for us? - Uh, sure.
they're just blobs.
how dare you?
triangles.
I counted too many plates.
mom's not here.
that's okay. - No, it's not.
she should be here.
I'm sorry.
that doesn't make a difference.
astor, I'm doing the best I can here.
let's just...Sit down and have some breakfast.
I don't want to!
I wanna go back home! - Astor...
stop it! - Yeah, just stop it!
both of you just stop fighting all the time!
I hate it!
while they're seeing the grief counselor, I'll be getting my own kind of therapy.
so is this, uh, something we should talk about?
whatever's going on between us?
no. - I mean...
we have sex one day, and then...
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person who would ever have sex with you.
I don't know what we're doing. - We're not doing anything.
we never did do anything.
we never will do anything.
so we never had sex? - Exactly.
that's really weird.
cause I remember... - I gotta go now. I'm gonna go.
how's it going?
I hate this shit.
this is Dexter's job.
blood. It's gross.
well, whoever cut the head off used the same weapon to cut the eyes and the tongue out.
but I can't find anything that fits.
I mean, I've tried two swords, three knives.
Hey...Try the machete.
I think we have a match.
I'll send somebody over there right away.
okay, yeah.
how's it going in there?
Masuka said he really likes working with the blood.
he hopes he can get more assignments like this.
I'll keep that in mind. Let me ask you a question.
if you were married, and you found out that the person you were married to had a secret bank account with a lot of money, - you think that person should share it? - Jesus, angel.
just because you married her doesn't mean you own her.
it's her money. End of story.
well, you got a dead body waiting for you.
Oh, fuck me.
why couldn't he have just hanged himself, took some pills or stuck his head in the oven?
people are so rude. Excuse me.
you again.
it's my neighborhood.
you were right about the machete.
good...I guess.
so what do we have here?
well, golly gee, Deb, I think we got a shotgun wound to the head.
approximately 24 hours ago.
make sure you swab the gun.
and check his hands for gunpowder.
I got it, I got it. - I'm just checking.
Dexter usually works cases like this.
we have an I. D?
according to this, Francisco alfaro.
Hey, can we roll him over?
Oh, looks like his face has changed a little since his driver's license picture was taken.
looks like him.
Hey...Check out the girl.
what? - Look at her.
imagine she has no eyes and no tongue.
holy shit. - It's her, isn't it?
those are the exact, same earrings. We've got our head.
bingo... looks like we got a murder-suicide here.
how you figure? - Well...
guy gets pissed at his wife. Cuts her head off.
leaves it in the park for everyone to see.
and comes home, blows his head off.
Masuka, we got some brain goo on the ceiling you need to photograph.
Oh, fuck me up the goat ass.
what about all that Santa muerte stuff then?
Yeah...There is no Santa muerte stuff.
that's what I'm saying. There was at the park.
there was, uh, missing eyes and a tongue and the gold candles and the icons.
there's none of that here. - No.
what do you think?
I think you're right.
who's she?
Hey...When is Dexter coming back?
Boyd Fowler works the 7: 00 to 4: 00 shift, which gives me time to check out his house, see if there's anything that'll put him on my table.
let me guess.
this is you putting on your oxygen mask first.
being on the hunt keeps me sharp. Focused.
thus, the better killer I am, the better father.
so he takes his work home with him.
no crime in that.
a man of simple taste.
looks like my grandmother's house.
a loaded hand gun. A no-no for a convicted felon.
but even so, not much to go on.
Boyd, you are very boring.
shit.
Boyd comes home for lunch.
okay, that's interesting.
do you want to have control of your life?
you have that power.
you just have to learn how to use it.
you can make up all the excuses you want.
you're too tired.
who keeps their attic door locked?
too old. Too fat.
too stupid.
you know, I've heard them all.
chicken noodle, chicken noodle, chicken noodle.
Where's the tomato?
but if you want something... - Take it!
you want that job?
well, then, take it!
it's entirely up to you.
the world does not put one...
you want that nice house on the beach?
take it!
the world does not put limitations on what you can have.
but if you want something... - Take it!
you have that power.
I can see having an old girlfriend's lock of hair...
but identified only by a number?
we are our own worst enemy.
make no mistake about it.
but with a few simple steps, I can teach you how to take control of your life.
take it!
all I'm saying if a woman pissed me off enough, yeah, I'd wanna cut her head off.
well, that's great to hear.
no, I'm not saying I would do it.
but I understand the impulse.
what are we doing here?
I told Dexter I'd check this place out for him.
Oh! Come in, come in.
Hey. - Hi!
um, we've just painted and installed new flooring throughout the house.
looks great.
lots of young couples in the neighborhood.
and the elementary school is about three blocks away.
I'm sure you'd be very happy here.
Oh, it's not for us.
I think we'd be very happy here too. Thank you.
well, I have to get a few things out of my car.
but if you have any questions, I'll just be right outside.
okay. - Thank you.
it's a nice kitchen.
decent appliances.
Oh, look at this.
great bedroom. Check it out.
don't.
comfy bed.
feel it.
get off the bed.
what do you say? A little nap time?
I'm leaving. - What did I do?
I've got to drop you off at the station, then pick up my brother's kids.
how desperate am I to follow Boyd to the middle of nowhere when all I've got is a bit of blood and a lock of hair?
but with nothing else to go on...
it's a rule of nature.
leave some old bedsprings out in the middle of nowhere, and soon, it'll be joined by a refrigerator, couch, car engine.
and now, a barrel, most likely holding dead animals.
too lazy to drive it back to the incinerator, I suppose.
Hey, Deb.
do you have the kids?
Harrison's with bill and maura, and...Astor and Cody are...With you?
shit.
what's going on?
did you drop them off at school this morning?
Yeah, they were seeing the counselor first, and then they were going to their regular classes.
well, I just went to go pick them up, and the woman in the office said that they never went to class.
so I called the apartment, and there's no answer.
well, where are they?
that's my question, Big Brother. Where would they go?
same place astor keeps saying she wants to go.
Hey.
how'd you guys get here?
we walked.
don't be mad, Dexter.
they wanted to see where it happened.
where they lost their mother.
I'm not mad.
astor, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you.
I should have brought you back here, like you asked.
if you want to move back here, then we will.
we'll find a way to make it work.
no, we won't.
astor, I'm sorry.
you keep saying that, but I don't care.
you ruined everything.
we'd gotten used to it. It wasn't that bad!
used to what?
to the way things were!
before you! Without a dad!
and then you come along and become a part of the family, and we thought that everything was gonna be good forever.
you made us think that!
and it's not true.
things got worse.
and now every time I look at you, I get so angry, because it was all just a lie.
it's not Dexter's fault.
I thought coming here would help.
but that was stupid.
no, I understand.
it looks exactly the same as before.
it does.
you can't even tell what happened.
but I know my mom died there.
and things will never be the same.
I miss her so much.
I do too.
we all do.
I don't want to live with you.
I want to live with grandma and grandpa.
I want to go back with them tonight.
right now!
Hey. I'm, uh, heading out.
you want to grab a bite somewhere?
no, why would I wanna do that?
all right.
Hey, lieutenant.
Deb told me about the Kyle Butler sketches.
Yeah, well, I'm not sure how useful they'll be.
the mother and two children all gave very different versions.
it's their biggest lead.
seems to be going nowhere.
do you mind if I keep a copy of these?
no, I got plenty.
let me ask you a question.
can you tell me why you kept his much money a secret from me?
it was never a secret.
that's my retirement fund.
well, now that we're married, aren't we supposed to share everything?
I don't think we ever discussed that.
then maybe we have different ideas about what a marriage should be.
because I always pictured you and I at 80 years old, walking down the beach, hand in hand.
I like to picture that as well, angel.
I love you.
but I think maybe I have more of a practical side than you do.
what does that mean?
I mean I've worked my entire career to save up, to protect myself, and you live every day like it's a party.
it's one of the things I like about you, but it also means that you spend money faster than you even make it.
okay! - And it's, I'm...
okay, I get it.
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
no, I'm fine.
I'm irresponsible.
Oh, Maria.
everyone knows that.
Hey, everyone!
drinks on me.
tonight.
Yeah! Angel!
that's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Hey.
so everyone's home safe?
Yeah, they're all inside.
you think they're finally settling in?
they're packing.
what do you mean?
Astor and Cody are... Leaving.
soon as their grandparents get here, they're going back to Orlando with them.
Dex, I'm so sorry.
for how long?
I don't know.
well, maybe if I talk to astor...
I already tried.
and Cody wants to go too?
no, he wants to stay.
it got...Very upsetting.
what did you say?
I reminded him that you and I are brother and sister, just like him and astor, and that it's important that they never split up.
all the shit we've been through.
I never would have made it through without you.
that's what I tried to tell him.
did it help?
not really.
I really was trying to make it work in my own way.
Yeah, I know you were.
I guess it's time to face reality.
reality.
Quinn.
okay, we had sex.
was it good sex?
I've said all I'm gonna say.
are we gonna have more sex?
good-bye. - Come on.
help me out here.
I'm hanging up now.
she wants to live her life stashing away all her little pennies, that's... that's her problem.
I can't do anything about that.
you know?
you want another drink?
you buying, right?
bartender, a cuervo silver.
you know how much money she's got? It's sick.
you tell me. Will you tell me?
Cheers.
it true you married Maria Laguerta?
I did indeed.
you got yourself a little sugar mama.
what? - Oh, yeah.
I remember when she was first starting out.
such a fine piece of ass.
I think you need to get the hell out of here.
you fuck!
if they need anything, just let me know; I'll send it.
we will. Thank you.
I lost my innocence at such an early age.
and it left a very damaging mark.
can't I stay with you, Dexter?
for now, you need to go with your grandparents.
don't worry, we'll still see each other all the time.
Orlando's not so far.
Yes, it is.
any shrink could tell you that's why I've always liked children.
because they connect me to what I can never get back.
I don't want to go, Dexter.
I don't want you to go.
what?
your mother loved you more than you could ever imagine.
and I...
me too.
Cody and astor showed me that I can still care about something.
that makes letting them go all that much harder.
and it's losing them that makes me realize there must be some small part of that innocent child still inside me.
because, just like astor,
I was foolish enough to think that things would always be good.
but they're not.
they're worse.
much worse.
normally, having a target would make me feel good.
give me direction.
a sense of purpose.
but now...
it means nothing.
and I don't know what's going to make me feel better.
should we go home?
give me a minute.
my wife died and it was my fault.
your dead wife can suck my dick.
that's the first human thing I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.
I don't want to live with you.
I want to live with grandma and grandpa.
FBI. Fucking bunch of idiots.
we know you didn't kill your wife.
we're just looking for a reason why Arthur Mitchell might have targeted her.
we all good here?
the only lead we have now is this Kyle Butler.
it looks like Santa Muerte, the cult.
who are you? - Officer Manzon, Cira.
we have sex one day and then...
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person who would ever have sex with you.
okay, we had sex.
was it good sex?
I've said all I'm gonna say.
you're welcome to stay here for as long as you want, whenever you want.
I heard the FBI interview went well.
they're looking for someone named Kyle Butler.
he's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's. They've having sketches done.
the Mitchell family all gave very different versions.
do you mind if I keep a copy of these?
you married Maria Laguerta? Such a fine piece of ass.
you fuck!
you're probably used to seeing dead things though, huh?
can't say I ever get used to it.
you want that nice house on the beach.
take it!
I can see having an old girlfriend's lock of hair, but identified by only a number?
I'm just trying to get to the truth.
however long that takes is up to you.
I'm telling you the truth. I'm not lying.
first, you said you didn't do drugs and then you said you did.
I said I might have tried some at a Tridelt party once.
you might have? What the fuck does that even mean?
you did or you didn't. You can't kind of do blow.
but that was six years ago in college.
and I'm supposed to believe you're not on anything now?
I'm totally clean. - Then why are you so nervous?
because I wasn't expecting on getting these kinds of questions.
I mean, you sound like a cop.
I am a cop.
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.
look, I don't know what's going on here.
I came for a nanny job.
I'm not, like, planning to kill the president.
Harrison needs a nanny and Deb insisted on running point.
the way it's going, only Mary poppins would make the cut.
I don't care what doctors say.
I think it's important for children to eat a lot of cheese.
well, if a child's choking, I just do what my mama always did.
you get ahold of it by the legs and you give it a little knuckle-slap.
no, I've never had martial arts training, but I can scream real loud.
I have a nursing degree with an emphasis on infant/toddler growth and development.
why not work at a hospital?
well, I did, but, um, there were budget cuts, and my ward was downsized.
I live alone. I don't need a big salary, so a nanny position would work very well for me.
he's tired.
may I?
I don't bite.
okay. - Hi.
what a little prince you are.
and then there was sonya.
practically perfect in every way.
well, you have my number. I'll look forward to your call.
again, my condolences for your loss.
Thanks. We'll be in touch.
Bye, prince Harry.
she's the one.
are you sure you don't want to keep looking, Dex?
I just don't want to lose her.
prince Harry likes her.
Ditto me.
then call her.
don't forget, you and Harrison...
crisis counselor. I won't forget.
love you, bro.
me too.
emptiness wasn't always a problem.
I used to cherish it.
but now it feels like something to overcome.
emptiness is all she has left.
Boyd Fowler. Department of sanitation.
division of dead animal pickup.
Hobbies: Self-improvement and storing women in formaldehyde.
I don't know if killing you will fill the void, but it's a place to start.
what's this?
ATM surveillance video.
the bank sent it over. This is our shotgun guy.
francisco Alfaro? - Yeah.
it's what he looked like when he had a face.
when was this taken?
two hours before he killed his wife and blew his own head off.
trying to get cash, but he keeps putting in the wrong pin number.
0371. His wife's birthday.
Ouch. Good thing she's dead.
he never would have lived that down.
what the hell happened to you guys?
battle scars.
we had to get ghetto on some dirt-bag at the club last night.
you guys got in a bar fight?
it's not worth talking about.
true warriors are humble men.
Oh, please. You got a reason to be humble.
you got fucked up running the other way.
you're confusing cowardice with a tactical retreat.
Hermano, back me up here.
you backed up just fine on your own.
okay, let's focus on the case, people.
remember why we're getting paid. - Okay.
I'll go first.
guy offs his wife, wants to skip the country.
needs cash, but he's so wigged out, he can't remember the pin.
gives up, goes home, kills himself.
only problem with that theory is Alfaro doesn't have a motive to kill his wife.
maybe he's just sick of her. - Oh, yeah, he got sick of her?
got sick of her, so he cut off her head and put it in a park and put candles all around it?
Yeah. Have you watched the video? 'Cause he's a little fucking crazy.
crazy does not explain why he doesn't have a drop of blood on his clothes.
why don't you think about that for a second?
how do you cut somebody's head off and not get a drop of blood on you?
What'd he do? What, wear a bib?
as much fun as this is, we're not gonna hash this out in the room.
I would like to re-canvass the neighborhood where Mrs. Alfaro's body was found.
there are a lot of houses facing that park. Somebody's bound to talk.
start today.
and I think Batista should be there.
hispanic neighborhood. Hispanic cop.
might raise the comfort level. Loosen tongues.
I get it. - Okay.
the rest of you, stay with the case. Work your leads.
Thanks. - Beautiful.
angel? - Mm-hmm?
just how big was this fight?
like I told you this morning, it was a disagreement that got out of hand.
too much booze. Too much testosterone.
you punched another cop.
I mean, que Paso? What started it?
we hashed it out.
hombre a hombre.
it's settled.
pretty sure his appetite's about the same.
he's always been kind of a messy eater.
it's hard to tell.
his sleeping pattern?
same.
unfortunately he cries about three times a night on a good night.
so you're not surprised that he's acting pretty much normal?
no.
you and Harrison suffered a terrible tragedy.
it's no getting around that, but there is something to be thankful for.
thankful? - Yes.
Harrison's cognitive abilities are really just developing.
so you're saying he might not be affected by what he saw?
there's just simply no chance that he was able to comprehend what was happening.
I saw something pretty traumatic when I was three.
Harrison's only ten months.
it affected me a lot.
you don't have any idea.
I've seen a lot of children.
we'll keep an eye on Harrison, but I really think your son is gonna be perfectly fine.
he wants his head back.
children Harrison's age can exhibit what might seem like violent behavior, but they're just releasing energy.
it's important not to read into it.
I'll try not to.
the most important thing you can do right now is take care of yourself.
find some time to release your own energy.
do something for Dexter.
Dexter will.
I have nothing to say.
I didn't see no one.
well, if you remember anything or if you hear anything...
Yes, mm-hmm. I call you. [speaking Spanish]
we're never gonna hear from her.
all this no talking is fucking frustrating.
Yeah.
you know what's frustrating?
9 days, 13 hours.
what?
since we... you know? Just...
you're counting?
I can't help it. I have an internal clock.
well, unplug it.
I'm just saying, at this point, we might as well be married.
shit on my face. You ever words like "we" and "married" in the same fucking sentence again...
another case of temporary blindness. Anything?
these people are all afraid of something.
Yeah, I'm getting that too.
maybe they just don't want to get involved.
no, I think it's more than that.
if the killer's dead, what are they afraid of?
I thought I could make some headway, but the reality is this is a venezuelan neighborhood.
so? - I'm Cuban.
officer Manzon's from this neighborhood.
she's a uniform, but she might be worth bringing in.
she thinks these are about religious murders. Santa mierda.
that's Santa Muerte.
it's "Saint Death," not "Saint Shit.
and Manzon might be on to something.
might explain why no one's talking.
shut up.
Hello? Hi. - Hi, it's Dexter.
Yeah, I don't know if I mentioned, but for his nap, Harrison likes the puppy blanket just touching his face.
it's on your checklist.
item eight under "sleep preferences.
okay, good. How's he doing?
we just read the very hungry caterpillar for the seventh time.
don't worry. He usually gets sick of it around the 20th read.
I gotta go.
Yeah, you call me if there's anything.
thought he'd never spot me.
some coinkydink, huh?
you find any more dead animals?
looks like you're working on something.
tastes a lot better than it looks.
have a seat.
Boyd Fowler. - Daryl Tucker.
you work around here?
I just love the arabica.
actually, I'm between jobs.
hence the want ads.
what kind of work you looking for?
not choosy.
whatever pays and gets me out of the house.
you like what you do?
I love it.
probably wouldn't think so, driving around, picking up dead animals.
eh, beats working in a cubicle.
you get out in the fresh air.
well, I guess most of the time it's fresh.
it's not boring.
never know what's around the next bend.
full of surprises.
you know...
if you're interested, we might have an opening at animal pickup.
Really?
Yeah, there ain't exactly a line either.
you should take a ride with me.
see if you like it.
you got to be okay around dead things though.
I don't think that's a problem.
great.
tomorrow morning, 8: 00 sharp.
I would have settled for your work schedule, but this could be better.
only 24 hours to get ready.
Boyd's patrol route.
need to find a place where we can spend some quality time.
there.
an old tourist welcome center.
not very welcoming now.
totally isolated.
thank you, city of Miami.
you're gonna kill him in daylight?
doesn't matter out this far.
it's still very risky.
what if someone comes by?
that could also happen at night.
but it's a lot less likely.
you have to do this right, Dexter. It's important.
it's your first kill since...
you don't have to tell me how much I need this.
that's the problem.
what?
this kill won't put everything right.
it won't bring Rita back.
it might bring me back.
if you make it mean so much, you'll only invite mistakes.
I won't make any mistakes. I'm following the code.
are you gonna help me or not?
I only want to help you, Dex.
this is a big room.
I hope you brought enough plastic.
it feels good getting the details right.
it's more than just preparing a kill room.
it's like I'm putting my life back in order.
and it's almost enough.
almost.
if anyone knows about these murders, it's Fauzi.
he knows everybody in this neighborhood.
you really grew up around here?
you make it sound like a disability.
I'm asking a question. I'm not about to burn a cross.
I used to ride my bike around this block.
there was this mean dog that lived there.
I mean, I used to pray to Saint Anthony to make me invisible.
I never got bit.
you think prayer was the reason?
Yeah.
that and some homemade pepper spray.
I was surprised you called.
thought you didn't believe what I said at the crime scene.
who says I do?
at this point, you can't rule anything out.
well, bringing me in was the best move, Detective.
you won't be sorry.
ask him if he's heard of the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Alfaro.
this was found at the crime scene.
did he sell it to Mr. Alfaro?
he says Alfaro was a strict catholic.
came in to the store now and then to buy some things, but he wouldn't have been caught dead back here.
did he sell it to anyone else?
he says he doesn't keep track of who buys what, and he doesn't even believe in this shit.
is that why he has the tattoo?
I got drunk one night, woke up, it was there.
you tell me.
Hey, hey. We were doing great in English.
you live in Miami.
why you no learn Spanish?
because me too busy making a living.
is there anything else you can tell us?
anything that will help us with this case?
Fauzi's holding back.
I should have talked to him by myself.
might have been in a more sharing mood with someone he knows.
Oh, yeah? Maybe he would have said nothing like everyone else in this neighborhood.
Hey, I know you're up against it, but you might just want to take a breath.
why don't we give him the night to stew over this and then you come visit him tomorrow alone?
fine.
where are they?
Hi, this is sonya. Leave a message.
Yeah, it's Dexter. I just got back and you're not here and not answering your cell. Call me now.
can't help but think the worst. Harrison's been stolen.
I shouldn't have left him with a stranger.
Rita would have never allowed it.
Hi. Finally fallen asleep.
where were you?
well, he was keyed up after his yo gabba gabba videos.
I thought some fresh air would make him drowsy.
it worked.
you didn't answer your cell.
well, I had my hands full.
Oh, I left a note on the fridge.
Oh, I didn't mean to worry you.
no, it's fine. I'm just...I'm not used to checking the fridge for notes.
just messages from other serial killers.
Oh, I feel terrible.
don't. You were just doing your job.
Hey, I'm lucky to have you.
we both are.
Oh, a little courtesy, please.
Thanks.
you hitting the club tonight?
no. Home.
Oh, good.
cause I won't be there to watch your back.
there could be wingmen out there looking to settle the score.
just drop it.
with all due respect, this man is a knight in shining armor.
you should be polishing his Lance.
excuse me?
I meant that metaphorically.
Not...How it sounded.
good night.
okay, I want to know exactly what happened at the bar.
I told you it's settled. [speaks Spanish]
I'm not asking as your wife.
Vince and I were having drinks, keeping to ourselves.
and then out of the blue, sergeant Lopez starts talking shit.
what shit?
you know...Shit. He was out of line.
specifics.
he asked if you and I were married.
then he said you were a fine piece of ass.
and you were my sugar mama.
sugar mama?
Yeah, 'cause you're my boss and your paycheck has more zeros.
does that really bother you? - A little.
do you know any guys it wouldn't bother?
so you hit him? - No, there's more.
more? - You wanted to know everything.
he then said you gave the best blowjobs in Miami.
and then I hit him.
and he's lucky that's all I did.
angel, I'm a woman in a position of power.
some men have trouble dealing with that, - so they spread garbage around. - I know. I know.
and I'm trying to work through it.
could you work through it without the bar fights?
I'll keep the bar fights at a minimum.
he sleeping?
like a baby.
how was work?
dire.
I've been saddled with this uniform on a homicide case and she's driving me ape-ass crazy.
how's the nanny?
aside from a little message hiccup...
it was totally my fault... she did great.
I wonder why she left Ireland.
maybe she's running from something.
I don't know, Deb. Maybe you better check interpol.
what about you? What'd you do today?
not much.
Cody called.
he wanted me to send my recipe for pancakes.
how are they?
Cody sounds... Happier.
Astor wouldn't come to the phone.
she'll come around, Dex.
well, other than that, I ran some errands.
that's good.
get back in your routine.
when you lose someone close, routine can be a ladder that can help you climb back into some kind of normalcy.
Where'd you hear that?
I am capable of independent thought, Dexter.
Oprah.
I watched her when I was laid up.
that's good.
keep getting better, Dex.
I'll try.
Yeah, I'd like to report a dead animal.
county road 5, mile marker 31.
I'm not sure. I think it was a gator.
it was long and scaly.
Yeah. Thank you.
it's on Boyd's circuit, so he'll get the call.
when he does, Boyd will take a little nap and wake up in the tourist welcome center, but he won't be collecting any brochures.
wasn't sure you'd be here.
wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hey, I'm a safety guy.
right.
never be too safe.
where we off to first?
dead cat on Lindgren. Boring.
pretty neighborhood though.
lot of trophy wives out jogging at this hour.
there's a bonus.
you have to embrace the now.
every second you waste is one more second you'll never get back.
ever hear this guy?
when I was searching your house.
changed my life.
really helped me see what's important.
do the same for you.
ease you through that divorce.
divorce?
ring dent.
I didn't want Boyd to know that part of my life.
for a roadkill janitor, he doesn't miss much.
hope it's not a touchy subject.
no, it just didn't work out.
if you need help moving on, listen to these CDs.
take it. - Take it now.
that's the main idea.
take it now?
there's more to it than that, but it really makes a difference.
of course, you got to know what it is you want to take.
what is it you want, Daryl?
that's kind of a hard question to answer.
Yes, it is.
but I really think it's what we're on this earth to find out.
Justin Bieber.
not that I know who that is.
I know who purchased the Santa Muerte icons and it wasn't our dead husband.
Fauzi talked? - I was right. He was holding back.
What'd you get? - No names, but a description.
2 guys in their 30s, strong accents, possibly recent immigrants from Venezuela.
criminal types. Those were his words.
and big into Santa Muerte.
what if Alfaro isn't freaked out because he just murdered his wife?
what if he's freaked out because someone's got his wife?
and they'll kill her unless he pays cash.
this isn't drug related.
maybe she was fucking held hostage for ransom.
you think Fauzi spilled everything he knows?
he's been asking around the neighborhood. Thinks he can dig up some more.
well, let's fucking find out.
sometimes it gets so hot, these things actually start frying.
and you got to...
you got to scrape 'em off like diner food.
two hours and no call about my gator.
they must have sent someone else.
God almighty. That stink gets in your soul.
which means this kill is dead.
man, you got a nose of steel.
you're made for this job.
now I'm stuck with Boyd.
so much for getting my life back.
it's almost lunch time.
I usually eat at home by myself, but there's a Chinese place not too far.
hang on.
Boyd.
maybe the universe is showing mercy on me.
what's the location?
I'm on it.
what's up?
dead gator out on county five.
first promising thing all day.
but if you're starving, we can push it till after lunch.
I'm good. - Then let's rumble.
gator runs can get hairy.
you got to be on your toes.
hairy how?
can't always tell if they're really dead.
Yikes. - Don't worry. Like I said...
I'm a safety guy.
must be at lunch.
Hello?
Hello?
shit.
detective.
call it in.
do it.
this is officer Manzon.
mile marker should be right around here.
be careful.
sucker could be anywhere. You really don't wnt to step on it.
finally...
it's right.
shit.
where am I?
on your way to county medical.
you know what city you're in?
Miami.
what day is it?
wednesday. What happened to me?
a motorist spotted you lying on the side of the road, called 911.
seems this guy shot you with a tranq dart.
boys have an argument or something?
no. No.
went off by accident.
crazy asshole, you were supposed to shoot the gator.
you got in my way, you fucking numbskull.
so what's your excuse? - Huh?
why were you unconscious?
they must not have found my needle.
I guess I was just so upset that I passed out.
there's one piece of good luck.
I really need to get back to my truck.
Yeah, sorry. I can't let you jump out of a moving ambulance.
we'll be there soon.
need to get you both checked over.
got him.
dropping it.
let's go.
let's go on three.
chart.
I'm Dr. lorre.
I understand you suffered a loss of consciousness.
that's what I'm told. - That ever happen before?
first time.
you have any history of headaches, dizziness, blurred vision?
hypoglycemia? - Not that I know of.
okay. We're gonna run a chem profile and check your glucose levels for possible dehydration.
we'll follow up with a tox screen.
see if anything's in your system. - yeah.
I'll be right back to draw your blood. Just lie still.
he's in there, okay.
just give him aspirin. No painkillers.
I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't know about his addiction.
well, you got to check the patient's records here, he's...
fifth time he's been in the E. R. this year. This is his fifth accident.
it won't happen again. - All right.
another head?
and I was in such a good mood.
it's my fault.
I got him killed.
fuck that. You didn't cut his head off.
they did this because he started talking to me.
if I hadn't come back here, Fauzi would still be alive.
it was my call.
we're in this together. And we're closer to catching him because of you, okay?
you did good.
looks like, uh...
the same treatment as our other, uh, head case.
eyes and tongue have been excised.
damn, don't people just shoot each other anymore?
excuse me a sec.
Hey, thanks for calling me back.
no prob. Sorry it took so long.
we're up to our necks on this trinity thing.
Yeah, that's what I want to talk to you about.
I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.
Yeah, you know, the guy who was hanging around with Arthur Mitchell?
Yeah, I know who he is.
just didn't know you people were working this.
I'm sort of, uh, flying off the record.
listen.
is there any chance I could talk to the Mitchell family?
the Mitchells are in a safe house. First stop before Witness Protection.
just want to show them a photo. Take five minutes.
give me the photo. I'll show it to them.
it's too sensitive.
if I'm wrong, it could mean my ass.
come on... Ray, as a friend.
I'll see what I can do, but no promises.
Thanks. Let me know.
take it.
now, before you can take anything, You have to know what it is you want. - What the fuck?
may sound easy, but you can't know what you want unless you know yourself.
but if you want something, there's only one option.
take it.
you want that promotion? Well, then take it.
you want that new car, that house?
take it.
that could have gone smoother.
could have also gone worse.
least he's down.
Hello? - Hi, it's Dexter.
wanted to tell you that I'm gonna be a little later than I expected.
it's no problem.
my sister should be there any minute though.
actually, she phoned too. She's tied up at work.
Oh. - It's okay.
I don't mind staying late. I...
I like watching him sleep. - You're a lifesaver.
I was gonna call you. - Is everything okay?
he took his first step.
at least I think it was his first.
he did? - It was only one step, but you could tell he was really proud of himself.
that's amazing.
I managed to get a shot for you. Check your email.
Thanks. I'll call you when I'm on my way home.
my son is walking...like a normal little boy.
I'm on my way there right now.
just start trolling for eyewitnesses.
maybe we'll catch a break. Maybe someone saw something, okay?
lieutenant Laguerta? - Yes?
Jim McCourt, internal affairs.
I wonder if I could have a word with you in private?
of course.
so...what's this about?
well, this is really a courtesy call.
we're about to launch a formal investigation into one of your detectives... a...Angel Batista.
I understand he's your husband.
Yes. Yes, he is.
apparently, he had a physical altercation with one of his fellow officers... a sergeant Lopez.
I was under the impression the matter was settled.
Oh, far from it.
Lopez collapsed while on duty today.
he's been hospitalized with internal bleeding.
my God.
we believe that he'll pull through, but he's filed charges.
something else you should be aware of:
we have two eyewitnesses who claim that they saw Batista kick sergeant Lopez while on the ground.
now, if that is true, that is assault with a deadly weapon and he could not only lose his job...
he could serve time.
had to borrow this from you. I hope you don't mind.
what the hell?
normally, I bring my own plastic, but...
I had to... improvise.
let me the fuck out of here.
I bet you've heard that before... "Let me out of here" from all the women you've killed.
I wish you could see the room I set up for you.
but you fucked everything up, Boyd.
all those pictures I took of the women you killed.
it's a shame you'll never get to see them.
I'll just have to paint a word-picture for you instead.
they were young.
just starting their lives.
now they're floating in formaldehyde and stuffed into barrels strewn around a swamp.
who the hell are you?
just a fellow traveler who...
also likes to pick up dead animals.
I did 'em a favor.
they were all suffering and I put 'em out of their misery.
Yeah, you'll be doing one more favor tonight.
what are you talking about?
I've recently suffered a loss.
my wife...was murdered by someone like you.
someone like me.
it turned my life upside down.
why is it my problem?
because you're the start of my healing process.
I knew you were fucked up the minute I laid eyes on you.
I was fucked up long before that.
you don't know what you're getting into.
remember in the truck you asked me what I want?
I want my wife back...
but this will have to do.
no church bells. No hallelujah chorus.
nothing feels different.
if anything, I'm emptier.
it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
it's okay. Here.
no, don't. Don't. Stop.
no.
she saw everything.
she saw...me.
my wife died and it was my fault.
your dead wife can suck my dick.
that's the first human thing I've seen you do since she died, Dexter.
I don't want to live with you.
I want to live with grandma and grandpa.
fucking bunch of idiots.
we know you didn't kill your wife.
we're just looking for a reason why Arthur Mitchel lmight have targeted her.
we all good here?
the only lead we have now is this Kyle Butler.
it looks like Santa Muerte, the cult.
who are you? - Officer Manzon, Cira.
we have sex one day and then...
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person who would ever have sex with you.
okay, we had sex.
was it good sex?
I've said all I'm gonna say.
you're welcome to stay here for as long as you want, whenever you want.
I heard the FBI interview went well.
they're looking for someone named Kyle Butler.
he's a friend of Arthur Mitchell's.
they've having sketches done.
the Mitchell family all gave very different versions.
do you mind if I keep a copy of these?
you married Maria Laguerta?
such a fine piece of ass.
you fuck!
you're probably used to seeing dead things though, huh?
can't say I ever get used to it.
you want that nice house on the beach. - Take it!
I can see having an old girlfriend's lock of hair, but identified by only a number?
practically Perfect
I'm just trying to get to the truth.
however long that takes is up to you.
I'm telling you the truth. I'm not lying.
first, you said you didn't do drugs and then you said you did.
I said I might have tried some at a Tridelt party once.
you might have?
what the fuck does that even mean?
you did or you didn't. You can't kind of do blow.
but that was six years ago in college.
and I'm supposed to believe you're not on anything now?
I'm totally clean.
then why are you so nervous?
because I wasn't expecting on getting these kinds of questions.
I mean, you sound like a cop.
I am a cop.
I work for Miami Metro Homicide.
look, I don't know what's going on here.
I came for a nanny job.
I'm not, like, planning to kill the president.
Harrison needs a nanny and Deb insisted on running point.
the way it's going, only Mary poppins would make the cut.
I don't care what doctors say.
I think it's important for children to eat a lot of cheese.
well, if a child's choking, I just do what my mama always did.
you get ahold of it by the legs and you give it a little knuckle-slap.
no, I've never had martial arts training, but I can scream real loud.
I have a nursing degree with an emphasis on infant toddler growth and development.
why not work at a hospital?
well, I did, but, um, there were budget cuts, and my ward was downsized.
I live alone. I don't need a big salary, so a nanny position would work very well for me.
he's tired.
may I?
I don't bite.
okay.
what a little prince you are.
bye baby bunting daddy's gone a hunting gone to find a rabbit skin to wrap the baby bunting in
and then there was sonya.
practically perfect in every way.
well, you have my number. I'll look forward to your call.
again, my condolences for your loss.
Thanks. We'll be in touch.
Bye, prince Harry.
she's the one.
are you sure you don't want to keep looking, Dex?
I just don't want to lose her.
prince Harry likes her.
Ditto me.
then call her.
don't forget, you and Harrison...
crisis counselor. I won't forget.
love you, bro.
me too.
emptiness wasn't always a problem.
I used to cherish it.
but now it feels like something to overcome.
emptiness is all she has left.
department of sanitation. Division of dead animal pickup.
self-improvement and storing women in formaldehyde.
I don't know if killing you will fill the void, but it's a place to start.
what's this?
ATM surveillance video.
the bank sent it over. This is our shotgun guy.
it's what he looked like when he had a face.
when was this taken?
two hours before he killed his wife and blew his own head off.
trying to get cash, but he keeps putting in the wrong pin number.
0371. His wife's birthday.
good thing she's dead.
he never would have lived that down.
what the hell happened to you guys?
battle scars.
we had to get ghetto on some dirt-bag at the club last night.
you guys got in a bar fight?
it's not worth talking about.
true warriors are humble men.
Oh, please.
you got a reason to be humble. You got fucked up running the other way.
you're confusing cowardice with a tactical retreat.
Hermano, back me up here.
you backed up just fine on your own.
okay, let's focus on the case, people.
remember why we're getting paid. Okay.
I'll go first.
guy offs his wife, wants to skip the country.
needs cash, but he's so wigged out, he can't remember the pin.
gives up, goes home, kills himself.
only problem with that theory is Alfaro doesn't have a motive to kill his wife.
maybe he's just sick of her.
Oh, yeah, he got sick of her?
got sick of her, so he cut off her head and put it in a park and put candles all around it?
Yeah. Have you watched the video?
cause he's a little fucking crazy.
crazy does not explain why he doesn't have a drop of blood on his clothes.
why don't you think about that for a second?
how do you cut somebody's head off and not get a drop of blood on you?
What'd he do? What, wear a bib?
as much fun as this is, we're not gonna hash this out in the room.
I would like to re-canvass the neighborhood where Mrs. Alfaro's body was found.
there are a lot of houses facing that park. Somebody's bound to talk.
start today.
and I think Batista should be there.
hispanic neighborhood. Hispanic cop.
might raise the comfort level. Loosen tongues.
I get it. Okay.
the rest of you, stay with the case. Work your leads.
Thanks. - Beautiful.
just how big was this fight?
like I told you this morning, it was a disagreement that got out of hand.
too much booze. Too much testosterone.
you punched another cop.
I mean, que Paso? What started it?
we hashed it out.
hombre a hombre.
it's settled.
pretty sure his appetite's about the same.
he's always been kind of a messy eater.
it's hard to tell.
his sleeping pattern?
same.
unfortunately he cries about three times a night on a good night.
so you're not surprised that he's acting pretty much normal?
no.
you and Harrison suffered a terrible tragedy.
it's no getting around that, but there is something to be thankful for.
thankful? - Yes.
Harrison's cognitive abilities are really just developing.
so you're saying he might not be affected by what he saw?
there's just simply no chance that he was able to comprehend what was happening.
I saw something pretty traumatic when I was three.
Harrison's only ten months.
it affected me a lot.
you don't have any idea.
I've seen a lot of children.
we'll keep an eye on Harrison, but I really think your son is gonna be perfectly fine.
he wants his head back.
children Harrison's age can exhibit what might seem like violent behavior, but they're just releasing energy.
it's important not to read into it.
I'll try not to.
the most important thing you can do right now is take care of yourself.
find some time to release your own energy.
do something for Dexter.
Dexter will.
I have nothing to say.
I didn't see no one.
well, if you remember anything or if you hear anything...
Yes, mm-hmm. I call you.
we're never gonna hear from her.
all this no talking is fucking frustrating.
you know what's frustrating?
9 days, 13 hours.
what?
since we... you know? Just...
you're counting?
I can't help it. I have an internal clock.
well, unplug it.
I'm just saying, at this point, we might as well be married.
shit on my face.
you ever words like "we" and "married" in the same fucking sentence again... whoa.
another case of temporary blindness. Anything?
these people are all afraid of something.
Yeah, I'm getting that too.
maybe they just don't want to get involved.
no, I think it's more than that.
if the killer's dead, what are they afraid of?
I thought I could make some headway, but the reality is this is a venezuelan neighborhood.
so? - I'm Cuban.
officer Manzon's from this neighborhood.
she's a uniform, but she might be worth bringing in.
she thinks these are about religious murders.
Santa mierda.
that's Santa Muerte.
it's "Saint Death,"not "Saint Shit.
and Manzon might be on to something.
might explain why no one's talking.
shut up.
Hello? - Hi, it's Dexter.
Yeah, I don't know if I mentioned, but for his nap, Harrison likes the puppy blanket just touching his face.
it's on your checklist.
uh, item eight under "sleep preferences.
okay, good. How's he doing?
we just read the very hungry caterpillar for the seventh time.
don't worry.
he usually gets sick of it around the 20th read.
I gotta go.
Yeah, you call me if there's anything.
thought he'd never spot me.
some coinkydink, huh?
you find any more dead animals?
looks like you're working on something.
tastes a lot better than it looks.
have a seat.
you work around here?
I just love the arabica.
actually, I'm between jobs.
hence the want ads.
what kind of work you looking for?
Oh, not choosy.
whatever pays and gets me out of the house.
you like what you do?
I love it.
probably wouldn't think so, driving around, picking up dead animals.
eh, beats working in a cubicle.
you get out in the fresh air.
well, I guess most of the time it's fresh.
it's not boring.
never know what's around the next bend.
full of surprises.
you know... If you're interested, we might have - an opening at animal pickup. - Really?
Yeah, there ain't exactly a line either.
you should take a ride with me. See if you like it.
you got to be okay around dead things though.
I don't think that's a problem.
great.
tomorrow morning, 8: 00 sharp.
I would have settled for your work schedule, but this could be better.
only 24 hours to get ready.
Boyd's patrol route.
need to find a place where we can spend some quality time.
there.
an old tourist welcome center.
not very welcoming now.
totally isolated.
thank you, city of Miami.
you're gonna kill him in daylight?
doesn't matter out this far.
it's still very risky.
what if someone comes by?
that could also happen at night.
but it's a lot less likely.
you have to do this right, Dexter.
it's important.
it's your first kill since...
you don't have to tell me how much I need this.
that's the problem.
what?
this kill won't put everything right.
it won't bring Rita back.
it might bring me back.
if you make it mean so much, you'll only invite mistakes.
I won't make any mistakes.
I'm following the code.
are you gonna help me or not?
I only want to help you, Dex.
this is a big room.
I hope you brought enough plastic.
it feels good getting the details right.
it's more than just preparing a kill room.
it's like I'm putting my life back in order.
and it's almost enough.
almost.
if anyone knows about these murders, it's Fauzi.
he knows everybody in this neighborhood.
you really grew up around here?
you make it sound like a disability.
I'm asking a question.
I'm not about to burn a cross.
I used to ride my bike around this block.
there was this mean dog that lived there.
I mean, I used to pray to Saint Anthony to make me invisible.
I never got bit. You think prayer was the reason?
that and some homemade pepper spray.
I was surprised you called.
thought you didn't believe what I said at the crime scene.
who says I do?
at this point, you can't rule anything out.
well, bringing me in was the best move, Detective.
you won't be sorry.
ask him if he's heard of the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Alfaro.
this was found at the crime scene.
did he sell it to Mr. Alfaro?
he says Alfaro was a strict catholic.
came in to the store now and then to buy some things, but he wouldn't have been caught dead back here.
did he sell it to anyone else?
he says he doesn't keep track of who buys what, and he doesn't even believe in this shit.
is that why he has the tattoo?
I got drunk one night, woke up, it was there.
you tell me.
Hey, hey. We were doing great in English.
you live in Miami.
why you no learn Spanish?
because me too busy making a living.
is there anything else you can tell us?
anything that will help us with this case?
Fauzi's holding back.
I should have talked to him by myself.
might have been in a more sharing mood with someone he knows.
maybe he would have said nothing like everyone else in this neighborhood.
Hey, I know you're up against it, but you might just want to take a breath.
why don't we give him the night to stew over this and then you come visit him tomorrow alone?
fine.
where are they?
Hi, this is sonya. Leave a message.
Yeah, it's Dexter. I just got back and you're not here and not answering your cell. Call me now.
can't help but think the worst.
Harrison's been stolen.
I shouldn't have left him with a stranger.
Rita would have never allowed it.
finally fallen asleep.
where were you?
well, he was keyed up after his yo gabba gabba videos.
I thought some fresh air would make him drowsy.
it worked.
you didn't answer your cell.
well, I had my hands full.
Oh, I left a note on the fridge.
Oh, I didn't mean to worry you.
no, it's fine. I'm just...
I'm not used to checking the fridge for notes.
just messages from other serial killers.
Oh, I feel terrible.
don't. You were just doing your job.
Hey, I'm lucky to have you.
we both are.
Oh, a little courtesy, please.
Thanks.
you hitting the club tonight?
no. Home.
Oh, good.'Cause I won't be there to watch your back.
there could be wingmen out there looking to settle the score.
just drop it.
with all due respect, this man is a knight in shining armor.
you should be polishing his Lance.
excuse me?
I meant that metaphorically. Not...How it sounded.
good night.
okay, I want to know exactly what happened at the bar.
I told you it's settled.
I'm not asking as your wife.
Vince and I were having drinks, keeping to ourselves.
and then out of the blue, sergeant Lopez starts talking shit.
what shit?
you know...Shit. He was out of line.
specifics.
he asked if you and I were married.
then he said you were a fine piece of ass.
and you were my sugar mama. - Sugar mama?
yeah,'cause you're my boss and your paycheck has more zeros.
does that really bother you? - A little.
do you know any guys it wouldn't bother?
so you hit him? - No, there's more.
more? - You wanted to know everything.
he then said you gave the best blowjobs in Miami.
and then I hit him.
and he's lucky that's all I did.
angel, I'm a woman in a position of power.
some men have trouble dealing with that, so they spread garbage around. - I know. I know.
and I'm trying to work through it.
could you work through it without the bar fights?
I'll keep the bar fights at a minimum.
he sleeping?
like a baby.
how was work?
dire.
I've been saddled with this uniform on a homicide case and she's driving me ape-ass crazy.
how's the nanny?
aside from a little message hiccup...
it was totally my fault... she did great.
I wonder why she left Ireland.
maybe she's running from something.
I don't know, Deb. Maybe you better check interpol.
what about you? What'd you do today?
not much. Cody called.
he wanted me to send my recipe for pancakes.
how are they?
Cody sounds... Happier.
Astor wouldn't come to the phone.
she'll come around, Dex.
well, other than that, I ran some errands.
that's good.
get back in your routine.
when you lose someone close, routine can be a ladder that can help you climb back into some kind of normalcy.
Where'd you hear that?
I am capable of independent thought, Dexter.
Oprah.
I watched her when I was laid up.
that's good.
keep getting better, Dex.
I'll try.
Yeah, I'd like to report a dead animal.
uh, county road 5, mile marker 31.
I'm not sure. I think it was a gator.
it was long and scaly.
Yeah. Thank you.
it's on Boyd's circuit, so he'll get the call.
when he does, Boyd will take a little nap and wake up in the tourist welcome center, but he won't be collecting any brochures.
wasn't sure you'd be here.
wouldn't miss it for the world.
Hey, I'm a safety guy.
right.
never be too safe.
where we off to first?
dead cat on Lindgren. Boring.
pretty neighborhood though.
lot of trophy wives out jogging at this hour.
there's a bonus.
you have to embrace the now.
every second you waste is one more second you'll never get back.
ever hear this guy?
when I was searching your house.
changed my life.
really helped me see what's important.
do the same for you.
ease you through that divorce.
divorce?
ring dent.
I didn't want Boyd to know that part of my life.
for a roadkill janitor, he doesn't miss much.
hope it's not a touchy subject.
no, it just didn't work out.
if you need help moving on, listen to these CDs.
take it. - Take it now.
that's the main idea.
take it now?
there's more to it than that, but it really makes a difference.
of course, you got to know what it is you want to take.
what is it you want, Daryl?
that's kind of a hard question to answer.
Yes, it is.
but I really think it's what we're on this earth to find out.
Justin Bieber.
not that I know who that is.
I know who purchased the Santa Muerte icons and it wasn't our dead husband.
Fauzi talked?
I was right. He was holding back.
What'd you get?
no names, but a description.
2 guys in their 30s, strong accents, possibly recent immigrants from Venezuela.
criminal types. Those were his words.
and big into Santa Muerte.
what if Alfaro isn't freaked out because he just murdered his wife?
what if he's freaked out because someone's got his wife?
and they'll kill her unless he pays cash.
this isn't drug related.
maybe she was fucking held hostage for ransom.
you think Fauzi spilled everything he knows?
he's been asking around the neighborhood.
thinks he can dig up some more.
well, let's fucking find out.
sometimes it gets so hot, these things actually start frying. And you got to...you got to scrape 'em off like diner food.
two hours and no call about my gator.
they must have sent someone else.
God almighty.
that stink gets in your soul.
which means this kill is dead.
man, you got a nose of steel.
you're made for this job.
now I'm stuck with Boyd.
so much for getting my life back.
it's almost lunch time.
I usually eat at home by myself, but there's a Chinese place not too far. Hang on.
Boyd.
maybe the universe is showing mercy on me.
what's the location?
I'm on it. - What's up?
dead gator out on county five.
first promising thing all day.
but if you're starving, we can push it till after lunch.
I'm good. - Then let's rumble.
gator runs can get hairy. You got to be on your toes.
hairy how? - Can't always tell if they're really dead.
Yikes. - Don't worry. Like I said...
I'm a safety guy.
must be at lunch.
Hello?
Hello?
shit.
detective.
call it in.
do it.
this is officer Manzon.
mile marker should be right around here.
be careful.
sucker could be anywhere. You really don't want to step on it.
finally... It's right.
shit.
where am I?
on your way to county medical.
you know what city you're in?
Miami. - What day is it?
wednesday. What happened to me?
a motorist spotted you lying on the side of the road, called 911.
seems this guy shot you with a tranq dart.
boys have an argument or something?
no. No.
went off by accident.
crazy asshole, you were supposed to shoot the gator.
you got in my way, you fucking numbskull.
so what's your excuse?
why were you unconscious?
they must not have found my needle.
I guess I was just so upset that I passed out.
there's one piece of good luck.
I really need to get back to my truck.
Yeah, sorry. I can't let you jump out of a moving ambulance.
we'll be there soon.
need to get you both checked over.
got him.
dropping it.
let's go.
let's go on three.
chart. I'm Dr. lorre.
I understand you suffered a loss of consciousness.
that's what I'm told. - That ever happen before?
Um...First time.
you have any history of headaches, dizziness, blurred vision?
hypoglycemia? - Not that I know of.
okay.
I'll be right back to draw your blood. Just lie still.
he's in there, okay.
just give him aspirin. No painkillers.
I'm sorry, doctor. I didn't know about his addiction.
well, you got to check the patient's records here, he's fifth time he's been in the E. R. this year.
this is his fifth accident.
it won't happen again. - All right.
another head?
and I was in such a good mood.
it's my fault.
I got him killed.
fuck that. You didn't cut his head off.
they did this because he started talking to me.
if I hadn't come back here, Fauzi would still be alive.
it was my call.
we're in this together.
and we're closer to catching him because of you, okay?
you did good.
looks like, uh...
the same treatment as our other, uh, head case.
eyes and tongue have been excised.
damn, don't people just shoot each other anymore?
excuse me a sec.
Hey, thanks for calling me back.
no prob. Sorry it took so long.
we're up to our necks on this trinity thing.
Yeah, that's what I want to talk to you about.
I think I may have a lead on Kyle Butler.
Yeah, you know, the guy who was hanging around with Arthur Mitchell?
Yeah, I know who he is.
just didn't know you people were working this.
I'm sort of, uh, flying off the record.
listen. Is there any chance I could talk to the Mitchell family?
the Mitchells are in a safe house.
first stop before Witness Protection.
just want to show them a photo. Take five minutes.
give me the photo. I'll show it to them.
ahh, it's too sensitive.
if I'm wrong, it could mean my ass.
come on... Ray, as a friend.
I'll see what I can do, but no promises. - Thanks. Let me know.
take it.
now, before you can take anything... What the fuck?
you have to know what it is you want.
may sound easy, but you can't know what you want unless you know yourself.
but if you want something, there's only one option.
take it.
you want that promotion? Well, then take it.
you want that new car, that house? Take it.
that could have gone smoother.
could have also gone worse. Least he's down.
Hello? - Hi, it's Dexter.
wanted to tell you that I'm gonna be a little later than I expected.
it's no problem.
my sister should be there any minute though.
actually, she phoned too. She's tied up at work.
it's okay. I don't mind staying late.
I... I like watching him sleep.
you're a lifesaver. - I was gonna call you.
is everything okay? - He took his first step.
at least I think it was his first.
he did? - It was only one step, but you could tell he was really proud of himself.
that's amazing.
I managed to get a shot for you.
check your email.
Thanks. I'll call you when I'm on my way home.
my son is walking... Like a normal little boy.
I'm on my way there right now.
just start trolling for eyewitnesses.
maybe we'll catch a break. Maybe someone saw something, okay?
lieutenant Laguerta? - Yes?
Jim McCourt, internal affairs.
I wonder if I could have a word with you in private?
of course.
so...what's this about?
well, this is really a courtesy call.
we're about to launch a formal investigation into one of your detectives... a...Angel Batista.
I understand he's your husband.
Yes. Yes, he is.
apparently, he had a physical altercation with one of his fellow officers... a sergeant Lopez.
I was under the impression the matter was settled.
Oh, far from it.
Lopez collapsed while on duty today.
he's been hospitalized with internal bleeding.
my God.
we believe that he'll pull through, but he's filed charges.
something else you should be aware of:
we have two eyewitnesses who claim that they saw Batis takick sergeant Lopez while on the ground. Now, if that is true, that is assault with a deadly weapon and he could not only lose his job... He could serve time.
had to borrow this from you. I hope you don't mind.
what the hell?
normally, I bring my own plastic, but...
I had to... improvise.
let me the fuck out of here.
I bet you've heard that before...
let me out of here..." from all the women you've killed.
I wish you could see the room I set up for you.
but you fucked everything up, Boyd.
all those pictures I took of the women you killed.
it's a shame you'll never get to see them.
I'll just have to paint a word-picture for you instead.
they were young.
just starting their lives.
now they're floating in formaldehyde and stuffed into barrels strewn around a swamp.
who the hell are you?
just a fellow traveler who...
also likes to pick up dead animals.
I did 'em a favor.
they were all suffering and I put 'em out of their misery.
Yeah, you'll be doing one more favor tonight.
what are you talking about?
I've recently suffered a loss.
my wife... was murdered by someone like you.
someone like me.
it turned my life upside down.
why is it my problem?
because you're the start of my healing process.
I knew you were fucked up the minute I laid eyes on you.
I was fucked up long before that.
you don't know what you're getting into.
remember in the truck you asked me what I want?
I want my wife back...
but this will have to do.
no church bells. No hallelujah chorus.
nothing feels different.
if anything, I'm emptier.
it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.
it's okay. Here.
no, don't. Don't. Stop. No.
she saw everything.
she saw...me.
What'd you get? - Two guys in their 30s. Strong accents.
possibly recent immigrants from Venezuela.
Masuka found a match on the print we had from the cigar butt.
he's got a brother, Marco, and I got the address.
cut him and I'll blow your fucking head off.
medic! I need a fucking medic!
don't you dare let him die.
I apologized, he accepted.
it's assault and battery.
Batista could not only lose his job, he could serve time.
according to sergeant Lopez's deposition, you give the best blowjob in Miami.
do you recognize this man?
Jonah, is this Kyle Butler?
back away! Back away!
you're on unpaid suspension until further notice.
suspension?
just tell everyone you're taking a few vacation days.
I don't want to be alone tonight.
I'm no good for you.
I'm not looking for good right now.
I just want to find out who that girl is before the m99 wears off.
why didn't you take me to the hospital?
because you saw me.
I didn't see anything.
we both know that's not true.
every one of these barrels has a body in it.
look at this.
no.
this is what happened to the girls before you.
this is what was gonna happen to you.
I saved your life.
I was locked up and I thought it would never stop.
but it has stopped. He's dead. It's over.
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me.
there were others.
we all have something to hide.
some dark place inside us we don't want the world to see.
so we pretend everything's okay.
wrapping ourselves in rainbows.
and maybe that's all for the best, because some of these places are darker than others.
carefully.
I want to believe that smile.
that watching your mother die hasn't changed you the way watching mine changed me.
gently falling.
sweetheart!
sweetheart, what is it?
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
he's got a scratch.
looks like someone was playing a little rough.
that's a little too familiar.
let's get a band-aid on him. - Okay.
that's it for today!
but I use a scalpel.
all you have are your fingers.
wiped clean.
not even a year old, you're already destroying evidence.
and having to flee the scene of the crime.
Aww, it's okay.
every time you see me, you look disappointed.
like you were hoping to find an empty table.
guilty.
still think you need to consider my advice.
leave town?
go home to people who care about you.
I told you why I can't do that.
if you stay in Miami, you'll never get past this.
if you had something horrible happen to you, could you just forget about it and move on?
I would want to.
what if you couldn't?
if you really want to help me get past this, help me find those guys and kill them.
I saw you kill Boyd.
you knew what you were doing.
usual?
Thanks.
going after those men won't help you get past this.
it'll only make it worse.
how could it get worse?
it'll open up something inside you you don't want to know is there.
trust me.
trust you?
I don't even know your last name.
the less you know about me, the better.
better for who?
for the both of us.
if you're not gonna help me, why do you keep coming back here?
I'm trying to help you.
Minneapolis.
Yeah, I used some miles.
you really want to get rid of me, don't you?
I want you to get on with your life.
she took the ticket.
maybe this is one problem I can check off the list.
and maybe it'll snow this week.
whoa. Where's the fire?
got to get my ass in gear or I'm gonna be late.
I could take that ass back to bed.
what part of "late" don't you understand?
I mean, at least let me make you breakfast or something.
I have no time. I've got to meet Batista at the hospital.
we're interviewing that kid Fuentes sliced open.
good luck with that.
good luck with "that"?
Fuentes has killed three people. I'm running down leads and you're sitting around in your boxer shorts watching TV all day.
Oh, is that why you're, like, all, let me get the fuck out of here,
cause I'm taking a few days off? - Just drop it.
this wasn't even my call.
LaGuerta said I had too many days. I had to use 'em or lose 'em.
that's bullshit. - No argument here.
I got to go.
Quinn's my partner. He should be here. Not you.
no offense.
look, what do you want me to do? He put in for his time.
no, he told me he was forced to take his leave.
that doesn't make any sense. - Exactly. So will you talk to Laguerta...
Oh, shit. - What?
it's the mother. What is she doing?
she's coming this way.
Oh, fuck me so bad. What am I supposed to say?
I'm sorry. It's my fault your son got his throat slit?
no, let me do the talking.
if it's okay with you, we'd like to ask your son some questions.
Si. - Yes.
Jandro, how you feeling?
a little better. - Bueno.
we were wondering if there's anything you can tell us about the man who injured you.
he's seen him around, but he didn't know who he was.
no.
I asked if he had heard anything about Fuentes around the neighborhood.
does he remember anything about that day? Anything Fuentes said or did?
anything at all?
he doesn't remember anything else. He was really scared.
Fuentes said he was going to kill him.
okay. Gracias.
he had a mark on his hand. [speaking Spanish]
a small one. - Like a tattoo?
can you draw it for us?
lumen needs to stay away from the darkness.
I, on the other hand, always need names for my table and there are few people more deserving than Boyd Fowler's accomplices.
nothing in Boyd's arrest record even hints he had help.
zero to go on.
I'll have to look elsewhere.
yours.
Thanks. You didn't have to do that.
no, it really is yours. You left it on the hood of your car.
Oh.
my head's in 50 places.
Masuka didn't even begin to keep up the case load.
well, good luck getting the midget porn off your hard drive.
he might have shown it to me.
how was mommy and me? Harrison break any hearts?
no, but he drew his first blood.
I think his little black book still has a few blank pages.
well, not for long.
he missed you this morning.
he's used to having his aunt Deb feed him his mango oatmeal.
Yeah, sorry.
you didn't come home last night.
no, it was late and I didn't want to wake you, so I just crashed at a friend's house.
Oh, what friend?
what, are you mom now?
you want to do lunch?
I think I'm gonna be dining on backlog.
and paying a visit to Boyd's house.
hmm.
all right, well, I'll bring you something back.
Bye.
wait a second.
what?
give me your opinion as a female.
as a female? - As a woman, you know?
McCourt.
what about him? - Do you find him attractive?
do you?
I mean, would you ever?
I would rather put a campfire out with my face.
okay?
I checked in with Cira.
she's gonna stay on the ATM video surveillance while I track down the tattoo.
let me see that again.
see, it still looks like a UFO to me.
who the fuck knows, right? - Yeah.
we need to talk to an expert. - An expert, huh?
the dragon lady represents the dualities of my inner warrior.
or your inner idiot.
Hey, if you can't muster up the appropriate respect,
I'm dropping the curtain.
when did you get this?
I've been adding to it over time, but the main work started about two years ago.
I was having a bit of a crisis and this was my way of working through it.
Viagra probably would have been cheaper.
this was a crisis of the soul, Morgan.
don't you have to have a soul before it could be in crisis?
point is you know a little about this world.
I know a little. The person you want to talk to is my body artist Michael Angelo.
you're kidding? Michelangelo?
two words. Michael Angelo.
and, yes, I'm serious.
if your tattoo were done by anyone local,
michael Angelo will know.
you can lower the curtain.
from the outside, a normal home is indistinguishable from the home of a monster who puts women in barrels.
but step inside...
there must be something around here that will point me to Boyd's accomplices.
somebody's been here.
Oh, great.
blood.
they were going through Boyd's files.
whoever Boyd was working with must have panicked.
tried to cover up any trace of their existence.
amateurs.
here he is, freshly bathed, clean as a whistle, - and ready for bed. - Thanks.
I'm gonna get going.
check's on the counter.
Sonya, can I ask you a question?
sure.
have you ever noticed Harrison being...Aggressive?
aggressive? What do you mean?
scratching. Stuff like that.
no.
he's a very gentle child, really.
Why?
there might have been an incident at one of the mommy and me classes.
can't be sure it was Harrison or not.
he's a little boy.
my little brother used to bite people.
bloody little cannibal.
now he's a vegetarian. Works for Greenpeace.
well, that's comforting.
not to worry.
you've got a little angel on your hands.
nothing can change that.
see you tomorrow morning.
night.
no match for daddy in the criminal database.
you're absolutely right. Maybe he drives.
let's check the DMV.
Minnesota.
she broke into Boyd's house.
she beat me to it.
Oh, my God.
this seem like the product of a stable mind?
a closet was the only place she felt safe from them.
she's remade it here.
Dexter, are you listening to me?
Yes, I'm listening.
she's not a killer. She's not you. She's coming undone.
what's that now?
this is the letter she took from Boyd Fowler's house.
from his ex-cellmate Robert Brunner.
getting paroled next week. Need a place to 'sleap'.
S-l-e-a-p.
she's found a target.
you don't know what she's planning.
I know this isn't gonna end well.
she keeps going this way, she's gonna get herself killed or thrown in jail and you're gonna be right there with her.
Dex, she's gonna bring you down.
I know what you're doing.
having breakfast?
you're looking for the men who hurt you.
so, what, you're spying on me now?
what are you gonna do if you actually find one of these guys?
maybe...
what you won't.
are you gonna kill them? Is that it?
I'm sorry.
you don't get to tell me what to do.
I asked for your help. You turned me down.
for your own good.
look...
you saved my life. I'm grateful for that.
but what I need from you right now is to leave me alone.
don't touch me!
these men put five women in barrels.
they're not gonna want to be found. Please...
stop this before it's too late.
she's not going to stop until she finds Brunner.
my favorite color.
help you, sergeant?
morgan has been all over me the last two days about Quinn.
what about Quinn?
the vacation he's being forced to take.
she's feeling short-handed without her partner, and to tell you the truth, we need him.
it's the union. Not my call.
that all?
is there anything I need to know about my case with I. A?
Mm-mm.
is there anything I need to know about anything else?
I'm sorry, angel, but I got to go.
sure.
I'll see you tonight?
yeah... Um, I might be late.
okay, so I'll late you know.
okay?
hope you didn't have to dig too deep.
only eight boxes, but I always remember to lift with my back.
well, here's the guy you asked for. Robert Brunner.
Nuh-uh-uh. Like we agreed.
right. - Hmm.
there you go.
that face.
abduction, torture, rape.
Mmm, he's so big. Is he a year yet?
ten months. - He's beautiful.
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
seven years for sexual assault. Out in three for good behavior.
Mmm. Good behavior.
you ever seen scars like that?
Yes. On lumen.
and he's out now.
thank you, state of Florida.
looks like she stumbled onto the right guy.
says he's living under Tuttle bridge. Is this current?
Mm-hmm. Sex offenders can't live anywhere near kids.
Tuttle's the only place they can go.
can I keep this? - At depends now.
you gonna bring this little cutie by to see me?
will do. - Okay.
Tuttle bridge is the perfect place for Brunner to hide in the dark, but not from me.
I've got to get to him before she does.
tramp stamp. I think I'm in love.
she's into needles. Why don't you show her your dick?
that's disgusting.
you are so judgmental, Morgan.
I mean, come on. We all have our own ways of expressing ourselves.
I have my ink and you have your...
Man-boots.
yeah? Well, expect my man-boots up your ass if you're wasting my time, okay?
now what can I do you for?
that's Michael Angelo? - The one and only.
m, how are you? - Come here.
good to see you. - Always good to see you.
m, this is the detective I was telling you about.
detective Morgan.
Enchante.
right.
mind taking a look at something for us?
any friend of sugar's is a friend of mine.
sugar?
okay.
we interviewed this kid who saw this on the hand of a suspect we're looking for.
any idea what it means?
crude, simplistic, but...
it's definitely an eye.
look.
the similarity.
see?
and that would mean?
eyes symbolize the third eye in our minds, like the God horus and also...
just like...
the back of a dollar bill.
hmm.
have you ever done something like this?
well, if I had, I would have remembered it.
anything else you can tell us? We're kind of desperate here.
without it in front of me, that's the best I can do.
I'm sorry.
no, it's okay.
m, thank you so much anyways.
always for you.
and you...
you come see me anytime, okay?
okay, thank you.
okay. - Okay, bye.
Bye.
I'll be in soon. - Bye.
Hey, I think she likes you.
don't ever speak about this.
since we're already here, why don't you get Quinn's name put on your...
Hey, I have a gun.
I'll just wait in the car. - Okay.
Hello?
Cira, it's me. - Any luck?
just a steaming pile of fuck all. Please tell me you have something.
I've gone through most of the bank's ATM footage.
eight names and counting.
they're all freaking out about something while they're withdrawing maximum amounts from their accounts just like our first Santa Muerte vics.
I want addresses for all eight names and any others you can find.
I'll pick you up on my way to work tomorrow and we'll check 'em out, okay?
poor Julia Tuttle.
the mother of Miami.
they named this bridge after her in her honor.
now it's crawling with pedophiles and sex offenders.
so much for honor.
japan's total area is slightly smaller than the U. S. state of Montana.
you mind if I watch?
the kid fuckers stay over by the tracks.
that's not why I'm here.
and why is that?
stuck-up little co-ed and I had a legal disagreement concerning the meaning of the word "consent."
take a load off.
appreciate it, brother.
Where'd you do your time?
my last stretch was in that shithole.
rough place.
Yeah.
told everyone I was in for armed robbery to keep a target off my back.
you from Miami?
used to be.
guy I bunked with lives down here now.
thought I'd let him show me the town and have some fun.
did that fun include lumen?
that is until my parole officer, the cunt, started giving me shit about staying with someone from the joint.
wound up here.
beats a cell. - Barely.
once my parole is done, fuck Florida.
I'm going north.
get me some of that farm-fresh pussy.
you ever tap that?
can't say that I have.
a couple weeks ago...
I had this hot little blonde on all fours.
a few of us did.
believe me, that bitch got every fucking inch of my motherfucking...
that's enough.
this room was meant for Boyd, not his cellmate.
they were co-workers, partners.
basically the same.
you're sure?
I need to kill him so lumen doesn't have to. I don't want her down that road.
think about what you're doing. - I am.
he's a sex offender. - I know.
on parole.
what are you saying? - Think!
are you listening?
okay.
he's wearing an ankle bracelet. It couldn't have been him.
she had the wrong guy.
I was ready to kill him.
I was ready to kill him.
I was ready to kill him!
robert Brunner isn't one of the men who hurt her.
Harry's right.
I have to convince lumen to do what I never could.
to move on.
you're home early.
Where's Sonya? - I sent her home.
she said you were gonna be working late.
hope you don't mind, I grabbed a beer.
what's he doing here?
he wanted to...
borrow a book.
he reads?
Yeah, he does.
here.
Thanks.
little vacation reading.
Quinn was just leaving.
what she said.
I will call you in the morning, Joseph.
Oh, okay, Debra.
kind of warm for gloves.
good night. - Thanks for the book.
what was that about?
it's late, so I'll take the couch.
are you and Quinn?
we're fuck buddies. That's it.
you need Quinn for that?
I know it's insane. I...
I know it's wrong for a fuck-ton of reas...
will you please stop looking at me like that?
it's your life, Deb.
just don't bring him around when Harrison's here.
what's that supposed to mean?
well, he's at an impressionable age.
we don't know what might rub off on him.
what will rub off on him? - Just keep Quinn away from my son.
fine.
you know, you're wrong about Quinn. He's...
not that bad.
Hey.
sorry. Long day.
dinner's in the oven.
you mind if I hop in the shower first?
you never called.
Yeah, I know. I just lost track of time.
why so late?
budgets are due at the end of the month, so.
I'm gonna...
I'll set the table. - Okay, thanks.
she's not there. You just missed her.
did my wife say where she was going?
you two still not seeing eye to eye?
look, I really need to find her. It's important.
she was asking about Tuttle bridge.
I told her that is the last place she wants to be.
what the fuck, asshole?
nice. Where you going, baby?
what are you doing?
I'm taking you out of here.
give me the gun. Give it to me! - No.
you have no idea what those animals did to me.
passing me around.
I couldn't move. I couldn't stop them.
it wasn't Brunner. - It was.
he was Boyd's cellmate.
he raped three women!
he tortured them just like he did to me.
that's impossible. - You weren't there!
just listen to me.
he's wearing an ankle bracelet as part of his parole.
if he leaves this place, it gets reported. I checked.
he was here the whole time you were taken.
robert Brunner's never seen you before. He's never touched you.
he never hurt you.
you were about to murder the wrong man.
Oh, fuck.
you see? This is where it leads.
but it's not too late. There's still no blood on your hands.
I just want to feel better.
I want all this to go away.
it will.
I don't see how it can.
go home...
back to your family.
if you don't put this behind you,
I swear what you're feeling now will only get worse.
okay, okay, okay. I'll go.
okay.
next one on our ATM list.
Oh-for-fucking-five. That's how I like to start my fucking day.
you want to make a bet why this one was taking a wad of cash out of the ATM?
gambling? Hookers? Drugs?
you're very cynical.
it's called being a detective. And blow me.
you have to put positive energy out into the universe.
right. Blow you.
you smell that?
holy shit.
little help here? Any time you're ready.
Yeah.
this is detective Morgan requesting CSI and body transport at 2075 ocean way for a possible double homicide.
and you need to tell Masuka and Dexter that they need to bring a bug kit...
and some fucking crackers.
you good?
you son of a bitch.
Hey, hey, hey! - Angel!
Hey, sergeant, you're making a big mistake!
the only mistake I made was not kicking your ass when you first laid eyes on my wife.
angel, let him go! This is a sting!
let him go!
you're wearing a wire?
no shit, you idiot.
what would have happened if he barged - in here a half hour ago? - I know.
just give us a minute, Jim.
you just don't learn, do you, Batista?
have you completely lost your mind?
I thought... - What? That I was fucking him?
what am I supposed to think? You barely talk to me.
the late nights. The sneaking around.
how'd you find us?
wait. You...
I don't even want to know.
I. A. needed my help to bust a narcotics cop on the take and I said yes.
Why? To close the books on your bar fight!
so I don't want to hear about sneaking around and late nights!
why didn't you tell me?
why didn't you trust me?
Maria, I...
morgan needs us on site. Double homicide.
my car's outside. - I'll ride with patrol.
fuck me.
come on, Liddy.
lieutenant, any comment?
not now. - Lieutenant Laguerta...
it's like the fucking food chain in action in there.
flies... the blow flies are attracted by the smell and they lay eggs and the beetles, they're drawn by the larvae, - and they burrow into every orifice... - I get it.
what do we know?
the vics' names are Daniel and Awilda Ortiz.
ATM footage showed
Daniel trying to make a maximum withdrawal about four weeks ago.
officer Manzon and I show up to interview him and we find the bodies.
the remains have already started to mummify, but the wounds are consistent with a machete.
I can make sure when I get them back to the lab.
we like the Fuentes brothers for this.
only weird thing is we can't find any Santa Claus Muerte mumbo jumbo bullshit.
we might be looking at the Fuentes brothers' first victims.
the defensive wounds and heavy smearing suggest our killers were still inexperienced.
beheading requires skill.
so we got their goddamn training wheels kill?
means we're back to fucking square one.
little downwind, please.
Oh, yeah.
that's never coming out. I liked this shirt too.
I'll get a jacket out of my car.
all right.
it was never a tattoo. It was a stamp from a nightclub.
it was a fucking nightclub!
it's a nightclub!
what's gotten into her?
find out, sergeant.
I'm gonna go deal with the press.
nice to have you back, Dexter.
good to be back, lieutenant.
reports on my desk, first thing.
all together once again.
one big happy family, eh, Dexerino?
Yeah.
you don't have to wait.
I don't mind.
I can pay you back for the ticket. I'll send you some money.
except...
I still don't know who to send it to.
and it's not necessary.
the ticket.
I came to Miami for a fresh start.
somewhere warm.
you're doing the right thing. Your parents will be...
happy to see you.
I tried to call them, but I couldn't.
what would I say?
just give it some time.
I can't tell them what happened to me.
I can't tell anyone.
you're the only one who knows.
you have my number. Call me if you need to talk about it.
I should... - Oh, yeah.
thank you.
you're welcome.
go ahead. Put it through. And your bags.
make sure everything's out of your pockets.
jewelry, belts.
step to the mat, ma'am.
is there a problem?
I can't let you through to your gate unless you consent to a hand search.
lift your arms.
I need you to stay still.
spread your legs.
are you home?
not quite.
are you at a bar?
I had to gas up the car.
my fault O'Malley's is on the way?
so ask me how my day was. - How was your day?
it was better than yours, slacker, 'cause I know where Carlos and his brother have been hanging out.
at a local club called the Mayan.
you got your lead. Congrats.
Yeah, we stake this place out, they show up, and then we take these Santa Muerte no-dicks down for good.
how about I get some steaks and beer and we celebrate?
well, there's nothing to celebrate just yet, but I have a good feeling about this one.
now get your ass moving. I'm starving.
on my way.
thanks for the cuervo, stud.
no problem.
I heard what happened.
fuck those I. A. rats.
and your boss.
she's the reason I'm here.
unpaid leave. Why?
for doing my fucking job.
that bitch put handcuffs on me and then that no-nuts McCourt parades me around that station like I'm a goddamn carnival prize.
well, they can both go fuck the dog.
they think I'm gonna cop a plea, they're both cracking walnuts up their ass.
I'm gonna fight this thing to my last damn dime.
you need some extra cash for those lawyers,
I might have a job for you.
Really?
and what would that be?
looking into someone. - Who?
guy I work with. Interested?
I don't know if I should be considering who's sitting in front of me making the offer.
what are you talking about? Have I ever fucked you over?
no, but Laguerta just taught me.
look, Quinn, you fuck with the bull, you get the horn.
you understand? - Yeah.
do you?
you got a name?
what the fuck kind of name is "Dexter"?
rainbows are an illusion.
refracted light to make us think something's there when it's really not.
is there darkness in Harrison or is it just my own fear being reflected back?
I just know he's the one who scratched Teddy. He was right next to him.
did you read about what happened to his mother?
that boy will never be the same.
there's nothing wrong with my son.
I'm sorry for ever thinking the worst, Harrison.
you'll always be my son.
whatever we have to face, we'll face together, okay?
Ow!
Hello, ma'am.
where you headed this afternoon? You need a cab?
welcome to Miami.
you were face-to-face with Carlos Fuentes, right?
so that means he knows that we're on to him.
tell me why they would ever return to this club.
you have one more night at Club Mayan. Make something happen.
this is Yasmin Aragon.
if we agree to drop her drug charges, she thinks she can get the Fuentes brothers in the club.
Hey.
I thought you might want a debriefing before we hit Club Mayan.
it's sort of not a good time. This is Stan Liddy.
you are boning our target's sister?
just tell me what you found out on Dexter Morgan.
you fucked everything up, Boyd.
Boyd Fowler. Hobbies:
Self-improvement... - Take it!
and storing women in formaldehyde.
every one of these barrels has a body in it.
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me. There were others.
I shot one of them.
Dexter, what do I do?
that last fucking bitch is alive.
they're gonna find you.
some experiences are so big they change your DNA.
I'm gonna have to find the rest of them, because that's the only way that I can feel this peace again.
I can't get revenge for Rita's death, but I can help Lumen avenge what was done to her.
how many more were there?
Hey. I brought food.
Oh.
have you eaten?
I ate this morning.
well, now it's night.
eat some more.
you're very...Controlling.
when I need to be.
so what else?
details would help.
besides the ones that we've already...
taken care of...
there was a watch guy.
"watch guy"?
I would be tied to a chair...
blindfolded.
sometimes I didn't even know if he was there until I'd hear this watch by my ear.
and then he'd lean in and whisper, "Tick, tick, tick."
that's the sound of your life running out.
okay. Anyone else?
suit and tie.
he'd take off his jacket and fold it very carefully and then lay it on a chair, like he didn't want to mess it up.
the suit guy I'd know.
he always took the blindfold off.
I guess he thought I'd be dead soon.
he was wrong.
so what do we do now? How do we find them?
I'm not sure "we" is the operating word here.
what are you talking about?
we're doing this together.
lumen, what I do, I do alone. I don't need a partner.
I said I'd help you, but...
fine. Forget it.
forget it?
there's no point to it then.
you want these men brought to justice.
Yeah, and I can't go to the cops because of you.
so you're gonna have to be a little flexible here.
I want to be a part of this.
we'll see.
gracias.
I need to get home to Harrison.
right.
the other part of your life.
there is no other part to Lumen's life.
this is all she has.
even so, I can't bring her into my world.
there's no place for her.
thank you.
I feel like I'm dropping off my prom date.
except this is my house and my wife is dead and I have no idea where Lumen fits into my world and this is all so weird.
exactly like my prom.
our level of national debt is unsustainable.
...where independent producers are weighed down by parasitic non-producers, a Democratic president and a Democratic congress.
you're just in time.
Hey, good night, buddy.
saint Brigid, circle us with your light so that no darkness shall overcome our world.
sleep well, little one.
that's either a Saint or the most boring action figure I've ever seen.
is that yours?
it's Saint Brigid.
to watch over you while you sleep.
good night. - Good night.
he doesn't need Saint Brigid.
he has father Dexter.
why are you up so early?
gym.
but how about it? You know?
I mean, we don't have to live here.
we could get a new place together.
Morgan.
I'm homicide. I don't do traffic accidents.
Wow. Uh, text me the address.
what's up?
dead people.
you're gonna get the same call. We're all getting called in.
why didn't you tell them I'm here?
because I'm not here.
basically, nobody knows we're seeing each other.
I just want to keep it that way.
wow, baby. You say the sweetest things.
can we at least drive in together?
Yeah, and then we'll go to Disney World and we'll ride all the roller coasters and we'll hold hands.
I don't even know what that means.
whatever it is...
it's big.
Hey, sergeant. What have we got?
you haven't been listening to the news?
weather channel. High-pressure system coming in.
what have we got?
we got her... And her...
and her... And her...
and her.
the girls in the barrels. How could this be?
someone tried to move them.
Where's the driver?
that's what we're trying to figure out. He took off.
go do your thing.
it's the blood guy, but we got no blood.
we don't know what we've got.
Yeah, what is this gunk?
it's formalin. Liquid formaldehyde.
Why? - An embalming agent.
because it was only applied topically, the internal organs of the cadavers continued to putrefy and leak out of the various bodily orifices, becoming congealed once they came in contact with the formalin.
that's what's on your shoe. Congealed organ.
what kind of sick fuck are we dealing with?
I'm just the blood guy.
we've got five victims.
all female, all blonde, all between the ages of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.
they're covered in bruises, contusions, whip marks.
looks like they went through some special kind of hell.
we'll get fingerprints off them once we get 'em to the M. E.'s office.
I heard the driver took off.
Yeah, we've got the guy that hit him. He was drunk off his freaking ass.
he said he saw some guy jump out and start running, but that's as detailed as his description gets. "Some guy."
that means he's still mine to find.
or Vince Masuka's.
Hey.
Hey, Dex.
that's some pretty crazy shit, huh?
Yeah, crazy shit. What do you got?
one men's suit jacket, size 40.
did you fold it or was it already like that?
I bagged it as I found it.
I also got fingerprints galore. - Excellent.
except for the steering wheel. Somebody gave it a quick wipe.
I'll get the vehicle back to the lab and we'll give it a more thorough going-over.
right.
so much for keeping my lives separate.
Yeah, what's up?
what you doing, boy? Sleeping late?
your buddy Dexter Morgan, you asked me to keep an eye on him.
yeah? And?
well, he's got some cutie up at his house.
he even took down the "for sale" sign.
what's this girl look like?
blonde, average height, late 20s.
slim, pretty?
that'd be her.
find out who she is. - You betcha.
come here. What are you doing here?
I saw the news.
I knew what it was. I had to come.
no, you didn't have to come.
Dexter, I was supposed to be one of those girls.
look, it's not safe for you here.
they could be watching.
what is this?
what does it mean?
it means they're on the run.
you need to go.
will you give me... Thank you.
shit a brick and fuck me with it.
you're never gonna guess who this truck is registered to.
jordan Chase is a very smart guy.
his first book made me realize how I'd been putting all these limitations on myself.
I mean, I've listened to all his CDs.
so did Boyd Fowler.
you think Jordan could have been driving that truck?
what? No way.
first off, that jacket is nice, but not that nice.
jordan wears nothing but the best.
that's part of his thing.
if you think you deserve something, then take it.
I've lifted two dozen fingerprints and they all seem to belong to the same person.
and whoever they belong to, he's not in the AFIS database.
dead end.
Ooh, a hair.
and another one.
it's not often I'm in competition with my own people, but getting the identity of the driver of the truck and getting to him before they do is the only way I can give Lumen what I promised.
all I get is a fucking computer.
I can order Jordan Chase books. I can order Jordan Chase CDs, but I can't talk to an actual person.
jordan Chase is a really popular man, you know?
he travels the world giving his little touchy-feely seminars. He's probably not even in Miami right now.
I've left messages all over.
if I don't hear back soon, I'm gonna kick their door in.
what about you? Anything?
Yeah, we've I. D.'d two of the girls off their fingerprints.
one was a schoolteacher from Wisconsin.
she came out here on vacation two years ago.
never heard from again.
the other one worked on a cruise ship that was docked here.
she disappeared just over a year ago.
Wow.
Yeah, these were good girls, you know?
one was 26, one was 29.
nothing on the other three?
no, I'm going through the missing person databases.
put their photographs out there.
DNA? - It's being run now.
looking for direct hits and familial hits.
listen. I heard about this two-bedroom place on Brickell.
upper unit, right on the water. Thought we could take a look.
this is not a workplace conversation, so please just shut up.
all I'm saying is, is this place is going fast.
listen, please, just not here.
you two...
now.
shit.
think she knows about us?
is this about... - The Santa Muerte case.
Oh.
I thought that was dead.
well, now it's alive. Barely.
Yasmin Aragon, the associate of the Fuentes brothers that sergeant Batista identified, has assured us that she will bring
Carlos and Marco into Club Mayan tomorrow night.
so we're on? - We are on.
I am personally overseeing this operation.
we can't risk word leaking out to the Fuentes, so it's strictly on a need-to-know basis.
rather than flooding the club with police personnel, we will be performing a small surgical operation.
we will take the brothers into custody before they get into the club.
detective Morgan, you'll be with me in the surveillance van.
detective Quinn, we're gonna post you inside the door of the club with officer Manzon.
I will be roving, placing myself wherever I believe most effective.
if we're gonna take them outside, shouldn't we be outside?
in order not to stand out like sore thumbs, we will continue with the posts we've already established.
thank you, detectives Morgan and Quinn. That'll be all.
let me make myself very clear.
you've wasted more than enough time and money on this case already.
you're supposed to be a master manipulator of the press, but you haven't even been able to do that.
every day I pick up the paper, read another story about how we're not doing our job.
get it right this time or we're gonna have an interesting conversation about your future.
where are we with Jordan Chase?
I've got Quinn on it.
we've made numerous calls to his organization, but we haven't been able to reach him personally just yet.
he could be playing hard to get.
in that case, we'll pay his office a visit to see if, uh...
probably won't be necessary.
jordan Chase.
Hi.
holy shit. That's him.
nice to meet you.
nice to meet you. - You too.
Mr. Chase? Oh, Mr. Chase.
stand back. - I, um... I, uh...
I took one of your seminars at the beach club a while back.
sure. In Palmetto Bay?
you remember?
of course I do.
you have to excuse Cole here. He, uh... he keeps the crazies away.
why don't you let me get a picture of you two?
Oh, yeah. Excellent. Okay. Okay.
all right. Smile.
one more.
got it.
jordan Chase.
nice to meet you.
Wow. Nice watch.
Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me when I was a teenager.
it's water-resistant to 100 meters.
I have no idea why I would ever need that, but it sure looks nice.
if that's the watch that Lumen heard,
I'll make sure it accompanies you to the bottom of the Atlantic.
Mr. Chase.
you must be the person in charge around here.
I was in Jacksonville.
got an early call from Cole here, my head of security, saying that one of our trucks had been stolen out of our lot and that it just might be the one we'd all been watching on the news.
I flew back as soon as I could.
I see.
we found an article of clothing in the vehicle.
my jacket. It's my personal vehicle.
I always leave my things inside.
and the keys? - The keys?
Yeah, we found the keys in the ignition.
there are a lot of ways to steal a car.
most thieves don't have the actual key.
I leave a spare set of keys on a hook inside our office.
all my guys know where to find them in case they need the truck.
honestly, they're just sitting there.
anyone could have grabbed them.
and you're head of security?
Yeah, Cole.
I might have to tighten things up a bit, hmm?
I want to make it very clear that the Miami Police Department has my full cooperation.
my organization is completely open to you.
this is a horrible, horrible tragedy.
please, anything I can do to help facilitate its resolution.
well, thank you, Mr. Chase.
first, we're gonna need fingerprints and hair samples from all your employees.
starting with Cole.
Absolutely. And if I could ask one favor?
I'd appreciate it if my name and organization wasn't released to the press.
being connected to this in any way would be a P. R. nightmare.
I'm sure you understand.
as long as we have your continued cooperation, that shouldn't be a problem.
sociopaths can't feel psychic pain, but they can feel physical pain.
Ow. - Sorry.
what do you think about Cole?
someone stole my vehicle.
the oldest excuse in the book.
still, it does happen.
and Mr. Chase is very high-profile, well respected.
it's hard to imagine someone like him or his people would be involved in something like this.
I took a few hairs from the headrest of the truck as well.
if someone else was driving, he'd have left some evidence behind.
And?
well, Cole's hair matches the hair on the jacket and the headrest.
fingerprints? - They're all Cole's. Even on the ignition key.
and Jordan?
his alibi holds up. He was in Jacksonville.
so for now, we got our eyes on Cole.
Dexter, you need to announce yourself.
I don't know who's coming in.
but it's okay to have packages delivered here?
I need things.
you said not to leave the house.
and what are you gonna do with that?
it's just a flashlight.
you have a way of bending the rules.
what's going on with the case?
do you know this man?
Oh, my God.
that's him.
that's the guy who folded his jacket. How did you find him?
he found us. His name's Cole Harmon.
he's Jordan Chase's head of security.
what about him?
no, I...
I mean, that guy's clearly a freak, but I don't know him.
no, not the bald guy. The guy beside him.
jordan Chase. - Oh.
no, I don't know him either. - You sure?
I told you, I didn't see most of their faces.
who is he?
he's some sort of motivational speaker.
this guy... I definitely know.
what next?
well, there's a problem. The homicide team is on this.
they'll probably arrest him within the next few days and once that happens, Cole will never see the outside of a prison cell again.
what about the other guys?
in order to save his own skin, he'll probably turn them in.
it's only a matter of time before they're all in the hands of the police.
but this is Florida. We execute here.
these men will be brought to justice.
you can walk away from all of this now, put it behind you.
you can go on with your life.
no.
that's not what I want.
I promise you the police will take care of it.
no, I don't want the police to take care of it. I...
I want to take care of it.
I know how she feels. It's not so different from me.
how much coffee are you drinking?
a lot.
I have to stay awake. What if they come for me at night?
she's stressed, on edge.
the way I feel when I've gone too long without putting someone on my table.
you said you'd help me.
I did. I just don't know that helping you kill someone is actually helping you.
this is all I think about.
don't back out now.
this is important to me.
truth is, I actually want to help her...
for some very complicated reasons.
if we want Cole for ourselves,
who?
the man who actually killed all those girls.
here. Put these on.
first thing we have to do is remove any evidence that you were ever here at Boyd's house.
if police find your fingerprints or...
anything that ties you to this place, they're gonna want to know what your relationship to Boyd Fowler is.
how you got here.
how you got out.
that's where you first found me.
we need to go up.
you okay?
I'll be with you.
Oh, God.
you okay? We can leave.
no.
he kept me tied up... Over there.
I don't know how long I was here.
maybe a couple days.
all I know is that he brought me here to kill me.
I'm guessing that was his job.
he was the finisher.
the last day, I chewed on that rope for hours.
I was finally able to slip it off.
that's when I went downstairs and I saw you...
...do what I did.
is that it? - Yeah.
I just need something of Boyd's to plant in the truck from the accident.
his wallet.
how did you know that was there?
I put it there.
I was giving Cole's truck another quick once-over and I found something that our blind-as-fucking-bats lab geeks missed.
what have you got?
a wallet.
he probably had it sitting on the console and then it went flying when he got hit.
I found it under the seat. - Cole's wallet?
no, that's just it. It's not Cole's.
whose is it?
Boyd Fowler's.
who the fuck is Boyd Fowler?
I'm going upstairs.
check it out.
there are locks of hair in here numbered 1 through 12.
12?
Jesus.
well, I'll run DNA on all the hair samples and match it to the victims.
the guy that did this...
died exactly where you're standing.
Hey.
in here.
the same exact barrel the girls were in.
Jesus. What'd he do with these?
the preliminary medical examiner's report said all the girls were electrocuted.
we're gonna need forensics in the attic.
I think he kept the girls up there.
it looks like Boyd Fowler has become our primary focus.
do you know this man?
no.
well, he knows you.
he has all your books and CDs in his house.
I've sold over a million copies of my book.
almost as many CDs.
I'm just trying to figure out how he came to be driving your truck.
well, I'm sorry, but...
I know him. Boyd Fowler.
he was one of your stalkers.
and how come I'm just now hearing this?
no reason to tell you about every nut that passes through.
he never seemed like a serious threat.
he took a few seminars a while back and then started showing up at our office asking for Mr. Chase.
I had to escort him off the premises a few times.
he was clearly a bit off, but he never struck me as dangerous.
he'd been in and out of our offices enough times.
probably saw where I put the keys.
when's the last time you had contact with him?
haven't seen him for a while.
couple of months maybe.
any idea where he might be?
no.
we have a warrant for his arrest.
I suggest that you be especially cautious, Mr. Chase, because if he has a thing for you, you could be in danger.
noted.
now, if you have any contact with him, please get in touch with us immediately.
this guy is very bad news.
I will.
thank you for coming in. I appreciate it.
you finally did something right.
steering the cops toward Boyd.
very smart.
it wasn't me.
daddy's going to Boca Raton tonight.
cause that's where Cole Harmon lives.
he's a bad man.
and I'm gonna try to find out who the rest of his bad man friends are.
you want that?
Hi.
there's my angel.
let me just set my things down.
wonder how much longer I'm gonna be able to talk to you like this.
soon you're gonna start to understand me.
Harrison clearly loves his Saint Brigid.
he put it with his favorite toys.
I put that in the toy box. - Sorry?
it's just a statue of a lady who died a long time ago.
she doesn't protect anybody or anything.
I should get to work. Here. Go to Sonya.
it's just this can be a very dark world at times, and since dear Brigid has always been a comfort to me,
I thought Harrison might feel the same.
I hope for his sake, you'd reconsider.
sure.
Bye, buddy.
so, uh...
what are you wearing tonight?
to the big stakeout?
a diaper probably.
I'll have to sit in that van with Batista for hours.
will you please not wear that awful shirt with the patterns all over it? It really makes me dizzy.
no, I, uh, only wore that as a joke.
Hey, I got to go. I'll see you later tonight.
okay.
Hey.
well, look at you. Pretty as a picture.
I only got a few minutes, so, uh, what do you got for me?
I don't work for free, Quinn.
all right, well, I just gave you 500 bucks.
and I told you about the girl.
but if you want to find out who she is, where she's from, and what she's doing in that damn house,
I might have to employ some methods just a little bit unorthodox.
and for that, you're gonna have to pay.
I don't know. - I know you got the cash.
Yeah, it's not that.
it's the pussy.
now lookie here, stud, if you're backing off this thing 'cause you're porking that guy's sister,
I'd say you've got your priorities as a cop all wrong.
I'm a little embarrassed for you.
I'll give you another five.
that'll work.
you don't have to do anything with this, okay?
you can just talk normally.
what do I have to do?
we're gonna walk you through the club so that our team can get a visual on you, and then you're just gonna wait by the door.
the second you see the Fuentes brothers, you walk up to them and you engage in conversation outside of the club until we move in and take 'em.
what am I supposed to say?
tell 'em how hot they look.
you really don't have to worry about anything. We're gonna be right there.
I want to make sure we're all in contact.
this is sergeant Batista. Is everybody getting this?
loud and clear. - I can hear you.
looks like we're all in place.
okay.
you'll do great.
they're already here.
say again? - I said they're already here.
sitting at the VIP table.
okay, how'd that happen? I thought we had all the doors covered.
I don't know.
I heard there's a secret door from the club next door, but I've never seen it.
okay, this is a change of plans.
Yasmin, go sit with them.
we're gonna sit tight until they leave.
once they step outside the club, we take them.
let's make sure we find that secret door and deploy a team there as well. Everyone got that?
got it. - Got it.
we've been here for over an hour.
I know.
well, you said there's a seminar in Naples.
don't you think he's there?
probably.
so what are you waiting for?
that.
the neighbor to go to bed.
I'm going in.
no, you're staying here.
what? No.
Yes. It's too dangerous.
I have no idea what's inside.
I'm gonna have my hands full without watching over you.
fine.
well, you can... Be the lookout.
it's so great working with you.
if you see anything, call me.
we are starting to look a little obvious.
I am gonna go get us a club soda.
all right, yeah.
he's calling me over.
no, keep moving. Ignore him.
this is lieutenant Laguerta. Officer Manzon, go to him, make nice, and try to get him to step outside the club.
lieutenant, no. This is a problem. These guys are dangerous.
stand down, Morgan.
she's in charge. Nothing we can do.
police! Drop that fucking gun!
holy fucking shit!
move! Move! Move!
stop right there. Down on the ground. Police! Drop the gun!
back away! - Drop the gun now!
Oh, you again.
you should walk away before this one gets more than just a little cut.
drop the gun right now.
please!
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
it's okay. Come here.
Cole as a teenager.
who the fuck are you?
no fucking way!
who are you, motherfucker?
we have to go before he sees our faces.
holy shit! I can't believe that just happened!
what made you come inside?
I thought I saw a shadow.
and that made you come crashing through a window?
I know. I know. I just had a feeling.
it was some sort of lizard brain thing.
she's starting to sound like me.
that's Cole.
and Boyd.
and Dan the dentist.
it's them from, like, 15 years ago.
do you recognize any of the others?
no, just those three.
what does this mean?
I don't know.
they've known each other since they were kids.
Oh, my God, Dexter. This is huge.
we just have to figure out who they are.
so what do we do next?
what?
you said "we."
put on your seatbelt.
this is a fucking disaster.
Carlos Fuentes was shot and killed.
our informant, Yasmin Aragon, was shot and killed, - as well as another innocent bystander. - Son of a bitch.
at this point, we don't know if it's by our gunfire or that of the two brothers.
additionally, three other bystanders were wounded.
I want a full report by 8: 00 A. M.
I know it looks bad. And it is bad...
but we are going to get through this. I promise you.
in the heat of battle...
all cops make occasional mistakes in judgment.
excuse me?
if mistakes were made, they most certainly were not mine.
Hey.
he was so relaxed and happy, I couldn't bear to move.
and I have to admit, he feels quite good.
he's always so happy in her arms.
partners come to us in various ways.
bound together for many different reasons.
but for any partnership to work, you must not only accept this person into your life, but accept her for who she is.
saint Brigid...
circle us with your light...
so that no darkness shall overcome our world.
Hey.
Hi.
Harrison, this is Lumen.
Hi. Oh, my goodness. Hello.
sometimes partners find us, and as much as we try??? into our lives regardless, until we finally realize how much we need them.
he's calling me over.
officer Manzon, go to him.
lieutenant, no, this is a problem. These guys are dangerous.
stand down, Morgan.
drop the gun now!
our informant, Yasmin Aragon, was shot and killed.
this is a fucking disaster.
if mistakes were made, they most certainly were not mine.
I just gave you 500 bucks.
and I told you about the girl.
but if you want to find out who she is, where she's from, and what she's doing in that damn house, you're gonna have to pay.
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me. There were others.
besides the ones that we've already taken care of, suit and tie.
he'd take off his jacket and fold it very carefully, like he didn't want to mess it up.
someone tried to move the girls in the barrels.
Where's the driver? - He took off.
that means he's still mine to find.
you're never gonna guess who this truck is registered to.
nice to meet you.
do you know this man?
that's the guy who folded his jacket.
his name's cole harmon. He's Jordan chase's head of security.
that's cole. - And Boyd.
and Dan the dentist. - It's them from, like, 15 years ago.
what does this mean?
take it
we are born primal.
conceived with the impulse to fight... For what we desire.
it's written in our genes.
it's engraved in our souls.
but we've traded the wilderness for pavement, trees for skyscrapers.
we've lost touch with our instincts, with what we are.
we have fallen from nature's grace.
but we shall be delivered!
it's time to tap into your primal selves and seize the power of instinct.
we're gonna cast off those shackles that bind us to jobs we hate, people we don't love, lives that aren't worth living.
we are going to...
TAake it!
I've never been around so many people that made me feel normal.
Yeah!
really normal.
the power of risk! -take it!
the power of desire. -take it!
the power of instinct. -take it!
instincts are all I've ever had.
Cole harmon, chase's chief of security - Torturer, rapist, killer.
it's time to tap into my primal self.
the power of life! - take it!
we're gonna take it! - take it! - Take it! - take it!
all right ! - Lieutenant laguerta! - Lieutenant, multiple rounds were fired at the recent club mayan shootout.
was miami metro responsible for the deaths of innocent bystanders?
I have nothing to say at this time. Excuse me.
do you agree with the mayor's assessment?
did this operation needlessly put people at risk?
every undercover operation is high risk.
is there going to be an independent investigation of the shooting? - No comment.
have you personally retained counsel? - Counsel?
isn't it true the victims' families have filed a civil lawsuit?
let me through. Excuse me. Let me through.
lieutenant Laguerta neither confirming nor denying miami metro's culpability in the recent club mayan shootout.
as we know, two innocent people are dead, six...
did ballistics come in? - It's good news.
bullets from the victims' bodies belong to the Fuentes brothers, not us.
that is good news, but this is far from over. I'm sure you all heard the mayor's statement.
a prime example of how shit just rolls downhill.
he should have kept his mouth shut until all the facts came out. - He was right.
this operation was too risky, and now because of us, two innocent people are dead.
not by our bullets.
shots would have never been fired if we hadn't been set up on that club. Those are the facts.
on the up side, Carlos fuentes is dead, - none of us should have any illusions.
there are gonna be consequences.
Yeah, I've seen that look on her face before.
someone's about to get bent over and fucked.
it's gonna be me, isn't it? - I screwed up.
no, you didn't. You were following orders.
LaGuerta's orders, just like the rest of us.
that's what you put in your report, right? You were following her lead?
I haven't written it yet.
I'm still sorting through the events in my mind.
sorting through what exactly? - What I'm gonna say about them.
here's a crazy idea. How about the truth? - Deb, I'm on it.
who's that? - It's yasmin's mother.
you all right?
three people are dead - Carlos Fuentes and two girls.
nobody's crying about carlos. - Fuentes was a scumbag.
Yeah, he's a scumbag that I shot and killed.
And? What's the problem?
don't tell me you feel bad about killing him.
I don't.
that's the problem.
Yasmin didn't feel any pain.
she died instantly.
I'm ready. - Okay.
I have some bad news for everyone.
you're all going to die.
some of us sooner than others.
and if you're not in touch with your primal self, you're already dead.
you may be breathing and walking around, but you're an empty shell, one of the herd, completely unaware of what you truly want.
and when we come back, we're gonna start using your instincts to design the life that you deserve, fuel the passion to make it real, and find the power...
jordan chase's "take it now" experience will resume at 2: 00 p. m.
in the meantime, we invite you to visit our vendors.
jordan promises change, but he also accepts credit cards.
lumen? - Can you talk?
or are you about to have a major life revelation?
no, that came around 9: 00 a. m. When I realized I really wanted a doughnut.
What'd you find?
I haven't been able to find out how these guys know each other.
the picture was taken when they were teenagers, but...
did you check high schools?
Cole went to westland prep in hialeah, and dan the dentist went to st. Joseph's academy in coral gables.
Boyd... There's nothing on boyd.
Yeah, he probably never saw the inside of too many classrooms.
I was able to find out something else about cole. - What?
he was in the marines. He got bounced on dishonorable discharge.
he beat up a superior officer and put him in the hospital.
this is a dangerous guy, Dexter.
do you remember the marks I had on my back?
that was Cole. So be careful.
you getting any rest?
I fall into a deep sleep from 1: 00 to 1: 15 every morning.
when this is over, I expect to sleep for a year.
I'll talk to you later.
Mr. Morgan. Cole Harmon.
I'm sure you remember me from our visit to the station.
Mr. Chase spotted you from the stage. He's very interested in speaking with you.
he was wondering if you'd join him in his suite for a few minutes.
uh... Okay. When?
how about right now?
all the way to the end.
to the left.
I'm disgusted, to tell you the truth. You haven't been listening to a word I've said.
call me back when you stop being a piece of furniture.
sorry. New client.
good to see you again, mr. Morgan, especially under better circumstances.
call me Dexter. -Jordan.
can I offer you a drink?
uh, no, thanks. I'm good.
think I know why you're here. - You do?
you're searching for a way to cope with your loss.
I know your history, dexter.
I thought I recognized you when we met at the station, but it hit me later on.
you wife was murdered. - yes.
they any closer to catching trinity?
not that I'm aware of. - I followed that case very closely.
Trinity-a religious man, family, good life.
yet he was working through such rage, harboring so many secrets.
I have to be honest. He fascinated me on a deep level.
what else do Jordan and I have in common?
I certainly don't mean to imply any sympathy for him.
he's a monster, no question.
I can't imagine your frustration, knowing he's out there, unpunished.
it hasn't been easy. - No doubt.
and now you're a single father, which has its own set of challenges.
why did you want to see me?
I've developed a theory on how the primal self deals with tragedy.
I have to prepare for the next session, but I am very interested in what happened to you.
I would like to discuss your situation in depth at another time if you're open to that.
okay.
by the way, have you made any progress on Boyd Fowler?
I'm not really aware of all the details.
you should probably speak to one of the detectives. - Of course.
I look forward to our next talk.
there's a little something in there for Harrison.
Thanks.
you wanted to see me?
close the door.
you know there's a lot of heat coming down on us, and the public's demanding blood. Our blood.
Matthews wants someone's head.
sounds like santa muerta's catching on.
I'm putting Cira Manzon on disciplinary leave.
what? - I need to put a face on it.
Detective- - You can't pin this on her.
her actions precipitated the shooting. - She wasn't even supposed to be there.
I tried to take her off, and you wouldn't let me. - That's your impression.
no, that's what happened.
look, I was the detective in charge, so if you want to fuck somebody over, here's your scapegoat.
I know your instinct is to take the fall for your team. - You were on my team.
in fact, you fuckin' took over my team, and I had your back, - 'cause your team, my team, whatever, it's all the fuckin' same. - Cira's just starting out.
her career will take the smallest hit. She'll recover quickly.
if something like that had happened to me back then, I never would have made detective.
we were all there together.
so why can't we just hold tight and weather the fuckin' storm together?
fuckin' think about it.
does your printer ever work? - Lu?
how are you?
um...
I bet you're tan.
the sun feels closer here, even though I know it actually physically is not, it feels like it's right there.
you're in miami?
I got a sunburn just renting the car.
I came to see you. - You did?
lu, I've respected your wishes.
since the day of the wedding, I haven't called, I haven't emailed, I haven't even texted.
it's like my life stopped that day when you left, and I need to get unstuck.
I feel the way to do that is to see you, face to face, without 75 of our closest friends and family staring at us.
please, will you see me?
I... Ahem. I can't tonight.
tomorrow.
I'm staying at the blue pelican motel. There's a cafe across the street.
meet me there tomorrow at noon, okay?
okay, noon.
Hey.
I got you some supper. Hot and sour soup, fried rice with tofu.
that's what you like, right? - Yeah, it's fine.
no, I'm not staying.
Oh, right. Harrison.
you're tired.
I spent the entire day staring at that laptop, and I got exactly nowhere.
well, the good news is you won't be on that computer tomorrow.
I have something I need you to do.
what? - Shopping.
what kind of shopping? - Supplies.
we have to make a room where cole will be dispatched.
it has to be covered in plastic. So does cole.
to catch the blood.
I made a list.
duct tape, 30 yards of clear polyethylene sheeting.
and garbage bags, three mil, black.
when are you gonna do it? - Tomorrow.
I booked a room right next to cole's.
you're gonna do it in the hotel? - No choice.
jordan's next gig is in Sarasota.
he and cole will be hitting the road right after the seminar ends.
so tomorrow night's the night.
there's a parking lot right on the corner of fourth and bay.
meet me there tomorrow at noon, and I'll pick up the supplies.
1: 00 would be better, just so I have enough time to shop. - Sure.
what?
a few months ago, I was shopping for a wedding dress, and now I'm shopping for...
30 yards of polyethylene sheeting.
tell me about it.
thanks for covering. - No problem.
Sonya just left.
I know you're hurting, so I'll reserve judgment, but I gotta draw the line somewhere.
it was free.
it can't hurt, can it? Maybe I'll come away with something.
Yeah, a really ugly onesie. I don't know.
if it's working, who am I to poop on your parade?
and your day?
I've got six mandatory sessions with a shrink coming at me because of carlos fuentes.
feels like a big, fat fucking waste of time, too. I mean, I'd kill that fucktard all over again.
I'd empty a fucking magazine in him.
okay.
maybe that's something worth talking about.
I always thought if I landed a bullet that it would bother me.
that it would...
it would be a burden to take another life.
they don't issue guns to lab geeks, so you have no idea what I'm talking about.
I can imagine.
I don't feel bad. Me, of all people.
I don't feel anything.
maybe I've just run out.
dad once told me that...
some people deserve to die.
you believe that?
you believe some people deserve to die?
some people don't deserve to live.
Trinity should be dead. Not Rita, not Lundy.
maybe the world is better off without Carlos Fuentes.
I'd pretty much given up hope.
I figured I was destined to go through life alone, and then I started listening to one of your cds.
the primal self?
I started listening in the car on the way to work.
three weeks later, I met my soul mate, and now we have a baby on the way!
come on up here. - Come on! Come on, honey!
Cole will be at his post for the rest of the session. That gives me an hour.
I'll have to do this in the dark.
14 steps to the pillow, give him the needle, and drag him to my room. 60 seconds tops.
jordan's about to lose his number one fan.
Oh. No, no, it's me. Really. - Sorry.
you look beautiful. - I don't, really.
you do. You always do.
Miami suits you.
you must love all these art deco buildings.
can't get enough of 'em.
Steph had her baby. - Oh, that's right.
she was due last month. - Yes.
meet Mavis.
look at her.
Mavis? - Mark's grandmother.
the name came down to Mavis or Madison. - Madison.
your niece could have been named after the city where you and I did our sunday beer runs.
cooler heads prevailed - Mine.
how is Steph doing?
she's tired, glad to not be pregnant anymore, cries at commercials...
and is transcendently happy.
your parents miss you.
they'd like to know that you're safe.
you can tell them.
well, I'm thinking of not going back, too. - What?
you were right. We were trapped in our jobs, trapped in that city.
we'd have been trapped in a life we didn't want.
it's time for that to change.
I bought these round the world tickets. Broke the bank.
we can literally hop on and hop off in any city.
I love you.
no matter what you do, whoever you are, I want to take this journey with you.
have you met someone? - I've met a lot of people here, but not like you're thinking.
I can't just leave.
me showing up like this is sudden, I know.
we had five years.
take a night to think it over.
I'm going either way, but I'd rather go with you.
meet me here tomorrow night and tell me your decision.
God fucking damn it.
what is it? - Un-fucking-believable.
lieutenant, will there be any other- - I don't know who your sources are, but I can confirm that detective morgan was in charge of the operation.
holy shit.
she's blaming everything on me.
is it true that detective Morgan has been placed on disciplinary leave?
as of today, she's being placed on immediate suspension with pay, pending the results of - Whoa! Not the plasma.
excuse me.
I thought we were actually friends. - Deb, wait.
I can't do it.
I can't let her throw me under the bus and drive over me, then back up a few fuckin' times and drive off.
fuck! Shit! Fuck!
didn't you see me driving up?
didn't you see me backing out?
you know, there's a reason why cars have rearview mirrors, lady!
I mean, shit, look at that.
this here's fiberglass. Can't pound that out.
I'm gonna have to pull that whole quarter panel off.
how do I know it wasn't already there?
you just hit my car. - I was distracted.
just let me give you some cash. - No cash! I don't want cash!
we'll do this on the up-and-up, 'cause that's the kind of guy I am.
we just let the insurance dudes hash this out.
you do have insurance, don't you? - Yeah.
well, halle-fuckin'- lujah.
now, let's just, uh, trade some info here and get this sorted out.
look, now, we can either do this the right way, or I can call up the po-lice, let Miami's finest handle it.
it's your call. - No. No, no, no. I...
the jordan chase experience seminar will resume tomorrow at 8: 00 a. m.
sharp. Vendors are open tonight till 7: 00 p. m.
how was your day?
I guess working for Jordan has its benefits.
Hello? - I'm here.
I'm on my way. - No, I mean, i'm here in the lobby.
what are you doing here? - I got into a car accident.
are you okay? - Yeah, yeah.
it was my fault. Actually, no, it was Owen's fault.
Owen who?
my ex-fiance. He's in Miami.
Why?
he came to see me.
don't worry, I didn't tell him anything about anything.
he asked me to go away with him.
just up and leave all this behind.
you could, you know.
do you want me to go? - If you want to... go.
this is the only part of my life that makes sense anymore.
what about Owen? - He's leaving.
when? - Tomorrow.
stay the night.
the seminar's out for the day, and Cole could be anywhere.
he could see you. It's too risky to have you walk through the lobby again.
if I stay, does that mean you're not gonna kill Cole tonight?
no, it's still happening.
we're gonna prepare the room together.
this is all much easier with a partner.
but a partner in what?
why didn't you tell me? - I was planning to.
I have no idea how the press got hold of it.
maybe it was because you fucking leaked it.
you'll be a desk jockey for a few weeks, then your union rep will have you reinstated.
this time next year, all will have blown over.
it's just your word against mine and everybody else that was there.
some people don't agree with your version of the events.
who'd you get to lie for you?
Batista? Batista's gonna back your fuckin' story?
do I have to go to Matthews with this? - You watch yourself, detective.
we wouldn't want your reinstatement to be delayed.
God.
I was fucking happy for you when you got married.
I actually thought that you being with batista might make you a nicer person.
I never expected you to fuckin' eat him alive.
Cole's other victims.
why did you put their pictures up?
Cole needs to see what he's done.
what do you get out of all this?
I like knowing that the men who did this to you won't do it to anyone else.
this isn't about me.
you're standing here.
look at all this.
if you didn't know me, you'd still be in this room.
Boyd wasn't your first.
you've been doing this a long time.
it's Cole.
we'll wait for him to go to sleep, then you take off and I grab him.
what's that?
m -99. Animal tranquilizer.
gives me a few hours to wrap his body in plastic and secure him to this desk.
you're gonna kill him while he's still out?
no, I'm gonna wake him up, see if he'll give up the other two names of the men in the pictures.
my knife can be very persuasive.
stay here.
Oww!
tie my other arm! Do it now!
let me go! No! Let me out of here!
what happened? - You fell asleep.
what about Cole?
he's back at the seminar by now.
the screamer spent the night.
so you're not gonna kill him? - No, I am.
I've been thinking about it all night.
Cole makes his security rounds at every session. - So...
I'll wait for him by the service elevator and m -99 him there.
I would have rather grabbed him at night, but I can make this work.
and what about me? - You'll wait until the session starts.
everyone will be in the seminar. You won't be spotted when you leave.
just steer clear of the service elevator. - Okay.
I can't believe it. - What?
I actually slept.
Hey. Do you want to get up? - No.
do you want to go back to sleep? - no.
do you want to just- No, I just -I don't want to do anything.
I just want to lie here.
it's sunday. I'm allowed.
LaGuerta's an evil bitch. - No, she's not.
maybe she is.
the best way to get back at her is to do exactly what she says.
go on leave, talk to your union rep, get reinstated, then come back and kick as much ass as you possibly can.
no one, not even Laguerta, can deny that you're a great detective.
at the end of the day, you'll be the one left standing.
at then end of the day? - Yeah, you know, when all is said and done.
sounds like one very long day.
Hey. I smell coffee.
now's not a good time. - Well, it is for me.
Hey, Debra Morgan.
liddy, right? - Good memory.
I like this one. - "this one"?
you and I got something in common. We've both been fucked over by Laguerta.
well, maybe we should make matching t -shirts or something.
okay. Well, this one's going for a fuckin' breakfast burrito.
I'll see you two later.
call before you come over. It's a common courtesy.
don't you want to know about this girl shacked up with dexter Morgan?
I just staged a little meet and greet with her.
old p. i. Move.
so you met her. - Name, lumen pierce.
Lumen-stupid fuckin' name.
from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
supposed to be married three months ago, picture in the paper and everything.
just takes off.
shows up here in miami one week before your boy's wife, rita morgan, is murdered.
now, what you think of that? - I don't know.
is that all you got? - It's a hell of lot more than I had yesterday.
well, stay on it. - I'd love to, but I am running out of loot.
I just paid you last week. - And I just fucked up my car getting this info for you quinn.
now, this boy is dirty. What you gonna do about it?
I'm not giving you any more. - You know, I thought you and me had an understanding.
I mean, it'd be a shame if the skirt you're bonin' finds out about all this.
and how would that happen?
I don't know . things go wrong every day.
fuckin' motherfucker!
you two are startin' to sound more alike every day.
must be love.
tragedy.
many of us here have experienced it in one form or another.
the kind that leaves you wondering if there's a reason to go on living.
for the last two days, you've heard me talking about getting in touch with your primal self.
but how does the primal self deal with loss?
Cole's starting his rounds. He'll reach the service elevator in five minutes.
in three minutes, so will i.
there's someone in this room who is dealing with that very question.
come and join me on stage, Dexter.
I know you weren't expecting this, but it's important. Please.
so much for slipping out quietly.
Dexter! - Dexter. They want you, dexter.
Dexter works with miami metro homicide.
recently, he lost his wife. She was murdered...
by the trinity killer.
the very person that dexter's department was hunting.
you were the one to find her, your wife? Rita?
Yeah. yes.
I'm gonna ask you to do something, Dexter, and it's gonna be very difficult.
I want you to relive that moment.
according to the newspapers, you were supposed to be going away on honeymoon?
Ye-yes.
tell us about it.
well, we postponed the honeymoon because we had a new baby, a boy.
keep going.
tell me how you found her. Please.
I'd come home after work.
I remember walking through the house.
I turned the corner and...
it's like time actually slowed down and then stopped.
it's just a series of pictures.
What'd you see?
I saw my son sitting in blood.
he was crying.
so much blood.
and she was there in the tub. She'd bled out.
her eyes were still open.
I want you to tell me something, Dexter. I want you to be very honest.
what did you feel in that moment? We want to know.
it's difficult to put into words. Everything...
fell apart. I felt...
shattered?
Yes.
when the primal self is shattered, it reaches out in search of what will make it whole again.
do you feel that, Dexter? That hunger inside you to be whole again? - I do.
that hunger is your primal self.
you must open your heart and listen to what it's saying.
many people after suffering a tragedy... - Mr. Harmon?
spend the rest of their lives as broken beings... - Can you sign this, please?
living in the past. Your primal self is crying out to be whole.
what is it that will make you whole?
for some, it's a new job. For others, the love of another person.
your primal self will tell you, but you have to be open to hearing the message.
are you? - yes.
then you've just taken your first step toward happiness.
you fuckin' bitch!
not this time.
I'm gonna take this gag out of your mouth, but if you make one sound I don't like, i'm gonna cut your eyes out.
blink so I know you understand.
we know about boyd and dan the dentist.
and now you.
who are the others?
the guy who held a watch up to my ear.
tick tick tick.
that's the sound of your life running out.
what are there names?
what did he say?
look at the women whose lives you destroyed. Look.
death was the only kindness you showed them.
it's a shame you can only die once.
you said I'd done this before. That's true.
this is who I am.
when I was a child, my mother was murdered in front of me, and it...
shattered me.
I've done this ever since.
because for the longest time, it was the only way I could feel...
unbroken.
and then, rita was killed and none of this made sense anymore.
until now.
Miguel couldn't. My father couldn't.
can anyone live with the truth of what I am?
is Lumen what will make me whole?
moving in?
the lieutenant said I should bring some of my stuff into this department.
it was you.
LaGuerta asked you to back her story, and of course you did.
Deb? - Detective morgan, you're the youngest woman in miami metro to ever make detective, and I really admire you, like, a lot.
and I came here hoping to learn from you.
what you did you would never learn from me.
good luck. You're gonna need it.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to set the record straight.
I thought you were backing laguerta's story. - No, I didn't know what I was gonna do.
I was stuck between a rock and my wife, but I decided i'm backing you.
might not go over too well at home.
Hey, you're flesh and blood to me, like my kid sister, but better because I actually like you.
damn. - It's okay.
Yeah. It's okay.
most people wait until the seminar is over before checking out.
uh, I lose my nanny in an hour. I gotta get back to my son.
is everything okay?
it's nothing important. Just a little security glitch. - mm.
like your chief of security's head is in my luggage?
I want to thank you for coming onstage. - It didn't seem like I had any choice.
I know it was sudden, and you probably didn't appreciate it, but you'll look back on it, you'll realize it was worth it.
don't forget what happened here this weekend, Dexter.
I won't. - Act on what you've learned.
don't let it slip away. It's what I tell my clients.
tick tick tick? That's the sound of your life running out.
my primal instincts were right. Jordan's one of them.
take it, Dexter. - Oh, I will.
it's a law of physics that elements want to unify.
single cells in a petri dish thrash around until they coalesce.
and events in the universe that once seemed random are eventually revealed to have an underlying connectedness.
jordan chase is one of them i'm sure of it.
tick tick tick.
- But he wasn't in the photo. - Maybe he took the photo, I don't know.
we're gonna take down Jordan Chase?
first things first.
just... Let go?
just let go.
what do you think we're up against?
I mean, leaving the intestines on the scale wasn't done by accident.
the body part removal could be drug-related. It could be santeria, voodoo.
attendance in our preschool guarantees your child admission to our secondary school.
so you are catholic?
actually, I'm not.
what do you believe in, mr. Morgan? - Nothing. I don't believe in anything.
you can believe whatever you want to believe, but it's not just about you anymore.
what kind of father keeps blood slides in his apartment?
ladies and gentlemen, I give you captain laguerta.
it seems smaller without your stuff.
I had to make room for you. - But I'm acting lt only.
not if I recommend you for the position full-time.
what is going on with you? You're acting so weird lately.
will you marry me? God, I sound like a fucking idiot.
get down, get down! Everybody down!
what have we got here? - Floater.
washed ashore. Some lady called it in.
it doesn't look like somebody was trying to hide him.
more like they wanted the body to be found.
there's something inside.
holy frankenfuck! Snakes!
this is no amateur.
so it's begun?
Yes. It's begun.
once upon a time...
until a few days ago, I was convinced there was nothing I believed in.
but I was wrong. There is something I truly believe.
everything's better after a bubble bath.
rituals are important.
not just for a serial killer.
but also for a two-year-old if you want him to go to bed on time.
here, put him back. - Not that I mind.
this ritual has become my favorite. Bedtime.
alone with my son. Being myself.
monster story, daddy. - Again?
okay, I may have told him this one before.
once upon a time there was a little chino, scaring everyone who lived in the hood.
nobody knew what to do. But daddy did.
he would slay that icky monster, hiding what was left of him in a special place that no one would ever find.
daddy's box.
you know about daddy's box?
I always knew this day would come.
just not so soon.
I'm not sure how this next chapter goes.
is that the last of them? - Just one more to go.
we'll be ready soon.
I may be a little late tomorrow.
and you tell me that n?
can't help it. It shouldn't take long. Nothing's changed.
Travis, we have to find another.
don't you think I already know that?
now look what you've done.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - No, it's okay. It's okay.
these things happen.
I just want to make sure that, uh, I can rely on you.
of course. - Good boy.
hello.
full-on breakfast.
Yeah. Uh, juice is in the fridge. Freshly squeezed.
fresh squeezed. Well, aren't we the fucking kennedys.
a good breakfast is a good way to start the day.
Yeah, another day of sitting on our asses, waiting for ois to clear us on the restaurant shooting. Pancakes?
you do realize the bar is set very high with me and pancakes.
my dad's were the best.
what the fuck?
what are you doing?
I wanted to do this the other night, but the shooting sort of messed everything up.
Debra morgan, will you... - Are you insane?
come on, deb. I'm trying to be fuckin' romantic here.
romantic isn't springing something like this on me. When... When have we ever talked about marriage?
will you get up?
come on, deb, we've been at this for a year.
you... You make me happy, I make you happy. - so?
so... I love you.
but...
this is huge!
you don't like the ring? Is it the ring?
no, it's... It's beautiful. It's just...
I just need time to think about this.
take all the time you need.
I'm not going anywhere. - Pancakes are burning.
Quinn just fucking proposed to me over fucking pancakes.
what the fuck is wrong with him?
he's quinn?
I never said I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.
I take it this means it's a "no"?
I can only hope. Quinn as deb's boyfriend is one thing.
uncle to my son, over his dead body.
maybe.
I don't know. I mean, I guess quinn makes me happy.
Really? 'cause there's a vein in your forehead.
Quinn and i, we get along great, and there's no drama. and...
after the last couple years, that's kind of nice.
But? - But I'm not sure I want anything more than no drama right now.
sounds like you have your answer.
but if I tell him "no," then it's over, right? And I'm not sure I want that either.
God, why can't things just stay the same?
tell me about it.
come on, we're gonna be late for the briefing.
watch this. She totally decks him. - She flattened that guy.
where was quinn? - She's already got 500, 000 hits.
Hey, hey, she's coming.
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hero. Fuck you very much.
you've totally gone viral, morgan. You're an internet sensation.
give it a rest, man. - What? Dude, she's a superstar.
I mean, have you guys read the comments on here?
Oh, she has, and if you're the one that wrote the poem about my ass...
I know not of what you speak. And it was a limerick, thank you.
can we get started, please? - All right, everyone, settle down.
where are we with ballistics from the restaurant shooting?
uh, all casings and bullets are accounted for.
all the victims were shot by the shooter's gun, and no stray bullets from morgan or quinn.
the shooter talking?
he was pissed off the restaurant fired him. The manager was the first to go down.
two dead all because this asshole wanted his job back waiting tables.
all right, with the shooting behind us, we put everything into finding out who did this to omar rivera.
Dex, the m. e. Report come back on the fruit vendor?
nothing we didn't already know.
the stitches and the snakes are definitely post-mortem.
I and my lovely new intern ryan are still waiting for the medical examiner to return our snakes.
keep me updated. Yale Is looking into our vic.
Rivera had ties with the salas cartel.
you still thinking this is drug-related? - Well, to a cartel, a snake is a snitch.
if this wasn't a warning to others to keep their mouths shut, I'm not sure what the message is.
maybe because the message is in a language only I understand.
what is that holy piece of shit doing here?
I know that piece of shit. Or at least I did.
Rivera worked at brother sam's garage after he got out of jail.
Hey, I don't like it any more than any of you.
maybe the padre points us in the right direction.
guy like that and his ex-con fucking friends can go to hell for all I care.
brother sam?
one big, bad ex-con turned minister. Runs an auto body shop using former inmates.
and, as you can see, some of our brothers in blue think it's a sham.
they may be right. That can't be a man of the cloth.
that's a killer.
settled in next door.
well, that would explain the smell of perfume.
I was wondering, have you gotten around to finalizing sergeant batista's paperwork?
I'm on top of that.
because I haven't seen anything come across my desk.
I think the sooner the department has a full-time lieutenant, the better.
I could not agree more.
is that all, captain?
that's all.
when's the last time you saw rivera?
a few months ago.
he came in. He needed some brakes for his pickup.
he brought, uh...
ripe grapefruits and oranges.
it was a good day.
so are you... Are you guys any closer to finding out who did this to him?
well, that's why you're here.
but I need something to go on.
when I knew brother sam, he was Samuel Wright.
a string of holdups led to the inevitable.
one of his victims fought back and Wright killed him.
I was ready to make my move until a drug bust took wright off my table.
and you never saw rivera hanging out with any of his old crew?
no, I didn't.
omar had moved past that world.
he was on a righteous path.
it's...it's funny,'
cause I remember you saying the same thing about the last ex-con you vouched for.
remember victor torres?
he gets paroled and goes out and kills a 19-year-old girl.
there's not a day that goes by that I don't pray for that girl or reach out to her family.
well, her blood's on your hands.
there's a lot more than that girl's blood on my hands.
my past, the things that I've done, the life that I lived, - is haunting me to this day. - Bullshit.
I don't give a rat's ass what you think about me, you understand?
or the work that I do or the men that I do it with.
what I do know is this. Omar did not have this coming.
his demons were gone.
men can change.
men maybe.
are we done? - Yeah. Thanks for coming in.
but what about a monster?
you wanted to see me, sir?
I remember when I had this office.
Miami was a different place.
corruption was everywhere.
my dad said you never knew who you could trust back then.
Harry was one of the good ones.
and so are you.
thank you, sir. That means a lot.
it's why I'm making you homicide's new lieutenant.
me, right. Lieutenant.
Fuckballs, you're serious. Oh, f... Sir.
you're exactly what this department needs. A fresh face, new ideas.
wait, really?
you want me in charge?
I don't even know what to say. - Well, yes would work.
but this is batista's job.
he's expecting it. He's earned it.
well, sergeant batista's a fine officer, but he comes with certain, uh, baggage.
besides, he's not a hero. You are.
why does everyone keep saying that? I was just doing my job.
that's not how I see it. That's not how the city sees it. No.
this office needs someone like you.
Oh, my god. Dexter would flip out.
and poor masuka. I'd be that little fuck's boss.
I'd be everybody's boss.
this is an honor.
do you really think I'm ready for something like this?
listen, I know this is a lot to take in. We can talk about it more tomorrow, okay?
congratulations, lieutenant.
lieutenant.
what the fuck is going on today?
keep your eyes on the bouncing ball and not on daddy's bad pictures.
samuel wright killed this store owner in cold blood.
bashed in his head with a bottle.
now he's calling himself brother sam, professing to be a changed man.
but I can't tell if I'm seeing a man who's changed for the better or just a better cover.
daddy's box.
you want to put this in daddy's box? Thank you.
it seems like yesterday he was just learning to crawl.
daddy's box. - Or he's putting all the pieces together.
what I say, what I do.
where things go.
I'll be more careful. - Is that gonna be enough?
you're looking at homicide's new fucking lieutenant.
I know, right? Got any beer?
that's quite the day. Lieutenant.
Nope. Two beers in, and it still sounds fucking weird.
I can't do this.
and it totally dicks batista.
what could matthews possibly be thinking?
that you're smart, you're driven, you're a great detective.
who'll be leading the department that may hunt me down one day.
you should give yourself some credit. - You should give me another beer.
I'm empty here.
you ever wonder why dad never made lt?
he had his hands full. With me.
everyone talked about him like he was some super cop, but he stayed in the pen his whole career.
maybe he never wanted it.
you know, after his funeral, a tiny part of me was relieved.
I tried so hard to get him to pay attention to me.
and I thought with him gone, I wouldn't need his approval anymore, but...
20 years later, I still do. He's still up here in my head.
you don't say. - The weird thing is, if I take this job, I'll have achieved more than he ever did on the force.
and that's the part that scares the shit out of me. - Not sure I follow.
dad was my litmus test for what a real cop is supposed to be.
and if he never made lieutenant... - Then you have no one to compare yourself to.
and I don't want to be fucking Laguerta.
so how would I even know if I was doing a good job?
I'd be totally all on my own on this.
well, if you don't want the job, don't take it. - Fuck you. Of course I want it.
holy shit, I really want it.
Quinn again. What the fuck does he want?
out on a limb here, but maybe an answer as to whether you want to be Debra Quinn?
Jesus h. Fuck, I totally forgot.
Debra quinn. Your initials would be DQ.
like the... - I will kill you.
I have no idea what to say to him.
I've got to stall.
can I sleep here? About one life-altering decision a day is my max.
Yeah. I'll sleep on the couch in the other room.
that's why you don't suck as a brother.
Yeah, but what about as a father?
Oh, travis! God damn it.
really wish you wouldn't use that word.
well, maybe I wouldn't if my brother would use the doorbell.
you really scared me.
slow down. And save some room for dessert.
I told you I have to work tonight.
you're working too much. I can see it in your face.
I like to keep busy.
you want busy, try keeping a bunch of fifth graders focused on art.
today, all they could talk about was, they found another flock of those dead birds up north.
they think it's the end of the world or something.
what if it were?
uh, then I'd say we better eat this ice cream fast.
no, I-I-I can't stay. I have to go.
Oh, come on. Blow off work for once.
for me. I barely get to see you anymore.
well, that was before...
before what?
it's nothing.
Travis, we used to be so close. We used to talk and do things.
now it's like pulling teeth just to see you for an hour.
I miss you.
I miss you too.
then let me spend an evening with my baby brother. Please?
now, who put that there?
good thing I have just the place to get this fixed.
if brother sam believes in giving men like this a second chance, - who am I to deny him one on my table? - You here about eddie?
what? - Eddie. You here about Eddie?
his parole agent. - Oh, no, I'm just a customer.
I dinged my car. Is, uh, brother Sam here?
he's out back.
can I help you? - Yeah. I was hoping to get an estimate.
you're not from around here, are you?
your shop came highly recommended. - By who?
co-worker.
you out front? - Mm-hmm.
was that the holy spirit? Or his dark passenger checking out mine?
Yeah, my guys can have this out in a day or two.
good shepherd. What's that mean, exactly?
well, uh, the men you see here, they're like my flock.
and, uh, my job is to make sure that they don't wander.
that's a lot to take on. - Yeah, well, I got a lot to answer for.
nothing broke that can't be fixed, right?
lord have mercy.
no car is ever totaled.
Yeah, it's like a man's life. Like a man's soul. I oughta know that.
you know, I once killed a man and walked off scot-free?
for that I need... To pay. - To pay.
I'm surprised to hear you say that. - Don't be.
the spirit moves me to tell my story and share.
I was facing death row.
the judge presiding over my case suddenly dropped dead.
mistrial?
Yeah. It sounds like divine intervention. - Yeah.
Oh, god was playing me all right, you know.
I had to go out here and get good and high before he just said, son, that's enough.
and, uh, I get stopped.
possession charge. I go back to jail. But...
hallelujah, praise god, that's how I got saved.
so that darkness inside, it's gone?
no. It's still there, but I'm fighting its ass every day.
I really don't have much of a choice, you know?
I sacrificed that bad part of my soul to make up for some of the pain I caused.
Nick still hasn't showed.
you find him and you tell him i'm coming for him, you understand?
now. Tell him now.
one of the flock get lost?
Yeah, something like that.
so, uh, what do you say there, brother?
guess I'll be seeing you soon.
all right. You have a blessed day.
once we work our magic, we put it up on the board here.
what are the abbreviations?
what was run. Uh, TR is trace. TX, toxicology.
so where does everything go after it's been run?
inquisitive. I like.
evidence, down the hall.
whoa. Cool.
Oh, yeah. Medical examiner finally sent 'em over.
they don't make you squeamish? - Are you kidding?
I love this. - Me too.
hands off. - She's my student.
Yeah, and a lawsuit landing on my desk if she catches you staring like that.
sounds like someone's expecting to make lieutenant buzz-kill.
take these files down to central booking.
have them cross referenced with the CI lab and get back to me right away.
Yes, sir.
you really drink that swill?
keeps me young.
how about we go around the corner and I buy you a real cup of coffee? My treat.
okay.
Dexter, you got a minute?
Yeah, I need to get to my lab. - Has deb mentioned anything to you, - you know, about us? - She, uh, said you proposed.
And? - The pancakes weren't bad.
Aw, I fucked this up royally, didn't i? - I wouldn't know.
look, I know you and I have had our differences, but it would really mean a lot to me if you could help me out here.
well, this is between you and deb. - No, I know.
it's just, I don't want her to feel like she has to, you know, choose between you or me.
she doesn't. - Because it is never going to be you.
no, I got it. - I said it was my treat.
I got it. Here.
I can afford it.
what is it?
I just wanted to let you know that I'm the detective I am because of you.
thank you.
and you have always, always had my back.
and, more than that, you're like family to me.
where is this going?
don't look at me for a second. - Deb.
angel, matthews has asked me to be the new lieutenant.
I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted this.
what did you say? - That you should be the new lieutenant, not me.
what did he say? - He wouldn't listen.
I could never, ever do this job without your blessing, so you just say the word, and I'll tell matthews to go fuck himself.
this... Is really great.
you mean that? - Damn right.
it's about time a real cop had that job.
I couldn't be happier. Come here.
I'm gonna need that money back, though. - Okay.
it's been a long day, Maria. - I just found out about Morgan.
I'm so sorry. - There's nothing to be sorry about.
I was on the fence about this whole lieutenant thing anyway.
look, this has nothing to do with you.
Matthews is just using morgan to get back at me, but it won't work.
I mean, she's barely out of diapers. - Don't do that.
Deb's a good detective.
better than you ever were.
look, you're angry, and you have every right to be, but I will fix this.
I... - Enough, Maria, enough.
angel, I'm so sorry.
how come if matthews hates you, I'm always the one paying the price?
the good shepherd has fled his field for seedier pastures.
the question is, why?
it seems old habits die hard. Brother sam's not a changed man after all.
Hallelujah.
I can't come back for brother sam until I make sure he killed that man.
but while I'm checking, better safe than sorry.
I was right all along. Brother sam is no shepherd.
he's still a wolf.
well, it is an animal tranquilizer. - Good doggy.
who the fuck is out here? - Sam, it's me. I was here earlier. The suv.
I left my clicker for my garage in the glove compartment.
I thought it was too late to call. Do you mind? - Sit!
sorry. I didn't see anyone here. I thought I would be in and out.
your car's inside.
maybe I should just come back tomorrow. - No.
we can get it over with now.
okay.
appreciate it.
this isn't how I envisioned taking down brother Sam, but it's either him or me if I want to stay...
alive? - Get off the man's damn car.
can't believe you hit me, man. - I can't believe you took a shot at me.
now I'm confused.
take Eli out back and don't you think about running off.
I chased your ass down once. I'll do it again. You understand?
come on, boy.
your missing worker.
you know, the bible says david broke a lamb's leg to protect it from wandering off.
I have to tend to my flock any way I can.
drugs? - Yeah.
I knew when he missed his shift, he was just holed up in his house, getting high.
the good shepherd.
Yeah, when I have to be.
it's open.
the clicker. - Oh, right.
I got it... - All wrong.
is this what the power of belief is all about? Knowing a dead fruit vendor never strayed.
tending to a lost member of your flock. The ability to change.
what is it? - Nothing good.
stay back.
Where's our boy? - Safe.
please get off the property. - Fuck you.
is there a problem?
this is you staying back? This is not your fight.
Hey, you deaf, pendejo?
you should pick up your friend and leave.
Oh, we're going.
but not without our boy Nick.
I'm not afraid of you, son.
and I damn sure ain't afraid to die.
I know what's waiting for me on the other side. Do you?
mark the perfect man "and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.
shut up.
what you waiting for, son?
he can't tell if brother sam is bluffing, crazy, or a true believer.
join the club.
you don't want to do that. - Faith, brother.
God is in control.
Miami metro.
you kill him or me, you'll have the whole department after you.
yo, Julio, let's get the fuck out of here.
this ain't over.
well, until it is, I'm praying for you, son.
well, you best be praying I don't put you down like the last fuck-up that crossed me.
remember Hector Nunez?
they never found his body, did they?
that was... - That was a miracle.
Miami metro?
forensics department. Lab geek. They didn't need to know that.
you don't fight like no lab geek.
lord have mercy. It's just an...
evening full of wonders tonight, huh? Praise god.
the lord works in mysterious ways.
you don't say.
where were you last night?
my sister's.
she was worried about me.
I couldn't get away.
you know that she can't be saved, right?
she is a good person.
she's all that I have.
you know that isn't true.
you have me and you have god now.
but I see you have to be reminded of that.
is this what you want, Travis?
to hurt me. You see how I suffer for your sins?
stop!
I won't see her again.
I won't.
I swear. - It's my job to take care of you.
not hers. - Forgive me.
I will do better.
I will show you that I'm worthy.
Oh, fuck me.
Hey.
so...
you shouldn't have. Really.
you know, I figured if, you know, we're gonna talk, then why not over chinese from that place you like?
beer's in the... - I can't marry you.
fridge. - I'm sorry.
you're so good to me, but I can't.
well, if you don't want to be with me, then why are you with me?
because...
it wasn't...
this. - Oh.
I'm sorry for wanting to be an adult here, Deb, but...
I never meant to hurt you.
or lead you on.
I just like things the way they are.
Yeah. That's, um, not good enough, you know? I want more.
that's the problem.
I don't.
you are a great... - You know what? Just don't.
don't be here when I get back, all right?
Oh, and I'm your new boss.
just tell the little guy a story?
jamie put him to bed.
looks like brother sam's a changed man after all.
he was true to his word about being a good shepherd.
he put his own life on the line to save that kid from a pack of wolves.
and here's the leader of the pack.
Harrison eventually is going to need a good shepherd too.
I'll be there for him.
and what about him?
I was set on proving brother sam still deserves to be on my table, but miraculously, Julio goes and vets himself to take his place.
Hector Nunez was a barber in Julio's neighborhood.
went missing six months ago. No body.
the almighty at work?
I'm not ready to call julio a sign from god, but I am thankful for the bounty I am about to receive.
I have any clean shirts? - Your room. Or former room.
Deb being here is temporary. - Who doesn't rinse out their bowl?
temporary, I promise.
Deb. I need a shirt.
what do you think?
dad would be proud.
thanks again for letting me crash here until I find a place.
it's why I don't suck, remember?
just help Jamie out when you can.
am I making the biggest mistake of my life?
I don't know, Deb.
as harrison gets older, I've been thinking more about what I believe in.
I'm coming to find that the list is kind of short.
what do any of us really believe in? - That you'll be a great lieutenant.
screw dad. I'm gonna make you proud of me.
dissected all seven baby snakes. Stomachs were empty.
they didn't come from a pet store.
most likely the wild. Back to square one.
remember barry manilow tickets. - Toxicology's back.
on... On what? The board is clear.
the snakes. I hope you don't mind, but I ran tissue samples.
uh, wh... Which I, uh, would have done.
and look. Heavy metals.
if there was nothing in the bellies of the snakes, where did it come from?
uh, from mama snake.
who had to have been living in a toxic environment to pass it on to her young.
you wanna look up epa cleanup sites or should I?
I'd rather look up your...
I mean, I didn't... I wasn't...
please don't sue. - You like to watch.
good to know.
what the hell do you think you're doing? Morgan as lieutenant?
Yes. I was just sending over the paperwork.
fuck you, tom.
you get one of those as captain, but don't push your luck, Maria.
we agreed the new lieutenant would be batista. - I agreed to nothing.
and need I remind you that all personnel decisions are ultimately my decision.
if they weren't, your little plan to blackmail me wouldn't have worked.
this is gonna be a fucking disaster, and I won't take the fall for it.
well, we'll see, won't we?
Oh! Better hurry. Don't want to be late.
for what? - Your first official task, captain.
the everglades?
all 4, 000 square miles of it? That's your big break?
Oh, I never said the everglades.
I said hazardous waste sites near or around the everglades.
it would explain where the pollutants in the snakes came from.
Yeah. We narrowed this down.
someone could have seen the bad guys coming or going.
I suppose it's a start.
what gives with all the reporters?
we're getting a new lieutenant.
what the fuck did you say to Deb? - Good morning to you too.
you know, everything was fine until she spent the night at your place.
you know, she's made her choice, but it's not you or me.
press conference is starting.
everyone, thank you for coming on such short notice.
you're here today because it's my privilege to introduce an officer who...
well, under my watch has proven herself to be one of miami's finest and a true friend.
ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the youngest officer ever to make lieutenant in the history of miami metro homicide...
I gotta hand it to you, Julio. You ran quite a racket.
I read all about how you were shaking down local business owners like hector nunez.
you. Fuck you. - You recognize this shop, don't you?
my boys will fuckin' kill you for this.
let me guess. With your history of violence, Hector stood up to you and your gang and that's why they never found his body.
just the way they'll never find yours.
Yeah, I killed him. So what? You're a dead man.
my boys will f...
will miss you, I'm sure.
so I'll make this quick.
I have to get home.
I have a much more important ritual to tend to.
you must be thinking "why me" right about now. I can't explain it myself.
God. The universe. Irony.
brother sam wasn't who I thought he was, but you...
this... I know all too well.
always the same ending.
because monsters don't get to live happily ever after.
hands up, and... Good job.
the good thing about the mind of a two-year-old... It's easily distracted.
you want to roll it?
he won't remember daddy's box if he has one of his own.
monster story, daddy. - How about a new story?
once upon a time, there were three little pigs.
the first little pig built a house of straw.
the second, a house of sticks.
but along came the big,bad wolf.
wolves come in many forms.
some have big eyes,the better to see you with.
you want to connect this part. That's the joiner.
others huff and puff...
hey,you all right?
no. - While others hide in plain sight.
I think I sprained my ankle.I heard something snap - Really? Here,let's take a look at it.
What,did you fall down or something? - Yeah
I should know,because like it or not,I'm one too.
that's never going to change.
and neither is the fact my little lamb is becoming a little boy.
walking. Talking. Listening.
as much as I want harrison to stay this way forever,from now on, the only wolves in his life have to be the stuff of fairy tales.
I can no longer allow him to see the real me.
only the version that's make-believe.
it's the only way this story gets to have a happy ending.
that takes us to the snakes killing.
maybe Brother Sam was right about our victim.
is this what I think it is?
evidence from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.
you think that my becoming lieutenant had anything to do with what happened between us?
no, I'm sure it was just a big fuckin' coincidence.
I don't know how to act. I don't know what to do. I don't know who to hire.
Deb, you're too smart to think that this was gonna be easy.
I put my ass on the line even considering you, so stow the attitude.
are you going to be saved? It's up to you.
you got to cleanse me of-- of all my sins.
he's ready.
do you undertake to keep God's commandments and the faith of his son, our lord?
I do.
some people think that religion began as a way for primitive cultures to explain natural phenomenon -
the fire, the wind, the rain.
they created a God for each one.
I baptize you, my brother, in Christ. You are baptized with Christ in death.
you'd think science would have made religion obsolete.
but it hasn't.
go for a swim, come out a new man.
if only I believed it were that simple.
but Brother Sam believes, and because of that, he's fulfilled.
it's written all over his face.
that's my son, Harrison. Can you say hi?
guess not. - It's all right.
did you see Nick? He wanted to thank you for coming by.
Yeah, he can thank me tomorrow at the shop when I bring my car in.
what? You had another accident?
bad driving karma.
man, somebody trying to tell you to slow down, brother.
so what'd you think?
uh, it was... interesting.
don't get me wrong. The spiritual stuff, the second chances, I think it's great for Nick.
but not for you, huh?
I get it.
you take a dunk in the bay, you fix all your problems.
it probably sounds like bullshit to you.
that's one word for it.
but, you know, it's not about the dunk.
it's about... surrender to something greater than yourself.
I don't get it. - Well, man, just look around.
you think you make the sun come up in the morning? You think you can make the tide come in?
no, but that's the earth rotating on its axis, the pull of the moon.
so you do believe in something greater than yourself.
got to go. Work. - Okay.
Harrison, get the car.
Yeah, somebody got to do the driving with him.
go ahead.
Jesus Christ.
what's with the wicked rodeo?
your guess is as good as mine.
some sick fuck sewed body parts to mannequins and then strapped 'em to horses.
I mean, what the fuck? - Body parts?
this spectacle makes me think of... - Brian. My brother.
your brother?
Rudy the Ice Truck Killer?
sorry. - No, it's okay. I was thinking it too.
just the idea that someone would put this much... - imagination.
brutality into killing.
come here. I want to show you something.
lieutenant. - Hold on a sec.
check it out.
lieutenant.
I'm in the middle of something. Remember this?
Oh, it's the same insignia that was carved into the stomach of the snakes victim.
looks like a signature.
same sick fuck. Two different killings.
Hey, uh, lieutenant?
for the love of God, what?
right. One at a time. Go.
been calling around the local stables.
there's one about a mile north from here, reported four horses missing two days ago.
Quinn? - Mounted patrol's on the way.
they'll be here within the hour.
I've been counting the body parts and typing the blood, and it's all B-positive, so I think we're looking at one victim here.
Jesus. Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
he's trying to tell us something.
Yeah. "I'm a crazy piece of shit.
he's saying it's the end of the world. Something like that.
four horsemen of the Apocalypse-- white, red, pale, and black.
doesn't take a genius to figure it out.
and who are you?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Mike Anderson from Chicago. He's my replacement.
Mike, this is... everyone.
you were saying?
the killer's showing us a scene from the Book of Revelation.
a killer with faith?
damn, it's hot out here. - Yeah. It's Miami, genius.
what about snakes?
what about 'em? - Seven snakes.
any mention of them in the Book of Revelation?
don't know. I'll look into it. - Do that.
in the meantime, you two, go to the stable. See if a surveillance tape will give us a suspect.
Dexter, Masuka, take shots of the horses so we can start taking this shit apart.
whoever did this seems to be a member of my tribe.
but this is a horse of a different color.
what is this?
Masuka confirmed that the body parts all belonged to the same victim.
we got an I. D. off the fingerprints-- Nathan Roberts.
went for a jog a couple of days ago and never came back.
did you compare the kill wound against the snakes victim?
I did. - And?
it's a perfect match.
same signature, same kill wound. - Same killer.
the M. E.'s report said there was residue in the wound.
it's being processed. We should have it back at the lab later today.
any ideas for a murder weapon?
some kind of stabbing implement.
won't know for sure until we get the M. E.'s measurements for the wound.
what about the cuts on the body?
I'm guessing a bone saw.
what do we have here?
what is it? - I don't know.
some kind of message? - Another one?
Jesus. How much does this fucker have to say?
a lot apparently.
want to bet he left one on the snakes victim too?
nothing behind his eyes.
what about the mouth or the ears? - Already checked.
well, what are we missing?
we're not. It's what he's missing.
his intestines.
kind of reminds me of looking for the prize in a cereal box.
you were always good at that too.
jackpot.
1237, 1242. What do you think it means?
that I've been lieutenant for less than a week and there's already some game-playing, sick-as-fuck serial killer for me to catch?
technically, he's not a serial killer.
yet.
serial killing involves the murder of several people in three or more separate events.
so far our guy's only done two.
are you trying to make me feel better or worse?
sorry.
it's Jamie.
Hey, everything okay?
Oh, Harrison isn't feeling so great.
what happened? - I don't know.
he didn't-- he didn't eat breakfast.
but, I mean, he seems okay otherwise. Just a little tired.
I don't know. Maybe it's a tummy ache, or-- Should I cancel his play date?
Yeah, absolutely.
it's better to be safe than sorry. - Okay.
if he gets any worse... - I'll call you. I promise.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah, this four horsemen case, it's all over the news.
we need to address the press. - Already two steps ahead of you.
I called the conference for this afternoon, and I'm working on the statement.
well, Morgan's gonna make the statement.
but she doesn't have any experience.
I've led hundreds of press conferences, and, really, - under the circumstances... - Morgan is the new face of this department, Maria.
I'm still... - The old face.
no, set it up for tomorrow afternoon.
fine.
why the fuck would I lead a press conference? Isn't that your thing?
uh, usually, yes, but I made a strategic decision to put you in the spotlight.
you'll give the public the impression that the situation's less critical.
besides, dealing with the press is your responsibility as lieutenant.
I thought my responsibility was catching the horse fucker that's killing people.
you'll have to learn to multitask.
and while you're at it, you still haven't finished your fit for duty therapy.
the shooting was over two weeks ago.
how am I supposed to find time to go to a therapist? - Figure it out.
you're a liability until you get cleared.
fucking nightmare.
you okay?
obviously.
you'll be fine.
just-- Hey, never mind. Not my place.
what? Tell me.
you just might want to dress a little more... professional.
like a lieutenant.
I mean, you know, uh, skirt suit, heels.
what's wrong with the way I dress?
I mean, you kind of look like you're... - What?
a detective?
no, like you're going to a hoedown.
where should I put the medical examiner's report for the four horsemen's case?
uh, wherever.
uh, you busy later? Thought we could have our second date.
sure, I have roller derby practice until 9: 00, but we can totally hang after.
wait, wait, wait. You're a-- you're a derby girl?
got the bruises to prove it.
I think my head just exploded.
I have an idea.
why don't we have our second date right now?
what are you thinking? Little make out session in the women's bathroom?
I was thinking some show and tell in the evidence room?
even better.
not the dirty kind.
you know, showing me the Ice Truck Killer stuff was so cool.
I was just thinking maybe you could show me the Trinity stuff - or the Bay Harbor Butcher evidence. - I can't.
the FBI has all those files. But, um, I promise to make it up to you later.
you better.
now open the M. E. 's report. I'm dying to know what it says.
when Brian sent messages, they were tailor-made for me.
but I should still be able to crack this guy's code.
most of you have already met detective Mike Anderson.
he's working on a theory that our killer is reenacting scenes from the Book of Revelation.
there's a lot of brutal imagery here, and our killer had a lot to choose from.
I just the M. E. report from the four horsemen vic.
and guess what it says?
must be pretty important for you to bust in here like this.
uh, he's a little bit of a drama queen.
there were traces of oxidized iron in the kill wound. Rust.
I mean, nobody's used iron to make weapons since the Middle Ages, which means our killer could have used a ancient artifact.
what kind of artifact? - I'm not sure yet.
but the dimensions of the wound suggest a sword.
um, but there are hundreds of varieties of swords.
great. Stay on that. Mike, you were saying?
so far our killer has given us three tableaus.
the intestines on the scale, the snakes victim, and the four horsemen.
I'm sorry. Uh, tableaus?
it's a theatrical term referring to a picturesque grouping of people or objects.
Oh, all this time I just thought they were called crime scenes.
no, it's more than just a crime scene. Everything he's showing us has meaning.
from the positioning of the bodies to the clothes he puts on his victims, - nothing's by accident. - Exactly.
he's communicating with us. Mike's just helping with the translation.
the four horsemen of the apocalypse are described in Revelation 6,
verses one through eight.
as for the seven snakes murder, Revelation 13.
and I stood upon the sand of the sea "and saw a serpent rise out of the sea, having seven heads.
and what about the intestines?
there's no passage on intestines, but the scales of justice are all over the Bible.
I figure he's referencing God's judgment of mankind.
what about the numbers we found on the body? 1237 and 1242.
don't know.
but I can get in touch with a Revelation expert who might be able to tell us more.
they happened five days apart.
the two murders happened five days apart. The difference between 1237 and 1242 is five.
I don't know why I didn't see it before.
so the numbers are days. He's counting up to something.
to what? - Don't know.
but if all this Revelation stuff has to do with doomsday, maybe it's to the end of the world.
okay. So we're looking for a religious nutbag.
Quinn, Batista, round up any end-times fanatics that might have criminal records.
let's find this... Doomsday killer.
it's happening, Travis.
look around us.
people are afraid.
soon you'll start to understand what we're
Travis... Are you listening to me? - Yes.
they're afraid.
okay, I got it. She's pretty.
who? - The waitress.
you've been staring at her.
but we really have to stay focused.
so you don't think I should ask her out?
is that what you want? - I don't know. Maybe.
I think she likes me. - Hey, Trav. Can I get you anything else?
Yeah. - Yeah?
thank you.
I thought religion was supposed to be comforting.
but swarms of locusts, bowls of wrath? Why would anybody want to believe this stuff?
be honest. Professional or stupid?
professional. - Ha.
but you don't look much like you.
you want to tell me how I'm supposed to catch Doomsday if I'm spending all my time writing press statements, going to court-ordered therapy, and shopping for ugly-ass clothes?
you'll figure it out. You always do.
Quinn used to say that when I was in meltdown mode.
he saw you in meltdown mode and he still wanted to marry you?
poop explosion. - Harrison?
if it's Jamie, you've got bigger problems.
keep an eye on him while I'm down in the laundry room?
his tummy still upset?
Yeah, it's probably just a bug, but I can take him to the doctor tomorrow.
Hey, what's the matter, little man? You don't feel so good?
wish I could make it all better.
I guess there are some things even daddies can't fix.
so I gave you the friends and family rate, and I can have that to you ASAP.
Thanks. The sooner the better.
I just want to let you know I'm taking off, all right?
all right.
Dex, what's up? - Sup?
so you headed off to class?
Hey, Sam's sending me to computer class. Gonna build him a bomb website, yo.
Yeah, you better.
all right. Laters. - Be safe. Later.
see you, Nick. You really take care of these guys.
Yeah, well, you know, God's taking care of all of us.
here go your estimate. Again.
are these your notes? - Yeah.
every time I read it, I'm finding something new. You ever read it?
Yeah, I just started. For work.
we're tracking this killer.
we think he's reenacting scenes from the Book of Revelation.
that four horsemen case from the news, yeah?
lord have mercy.
saying it's in the name of God-- the devil is busy.
you think he's using God as an excuse to kill?
people use God as an excuse for a lot of things.
just because he believes in some crazy bullshit, that don't mean his faith is any less real.
but if faith makes people do such crazy bullshit, what's the point of having it?
it's human nature. Gotta believe in something.
right?
I mean, haven't you ever had a problem so big that you just couldn't handle it on your own?
Yeah. - Well, who helped you?
my dad.
well, you're lucky. You're blessed. That's a blessing.
faith, man, you put it in the wrong things...
fuck you up.
goddamn pantyhose.
has anyone ever died from crotch asphyxiation?
you have now crossed the line into inappropriate brother-sister exchanges.
is that lieutenant Morgan in a skirt?
I don't know. I don't recognize her without the man boots.
you'll recognize my foot when it's kicking you in the face.
Batista and Quinn's people of interest.
even if none of them is Doomsday, they're all totally insane.
at 9: 45 yesterday morning, four horses were released at the intersection...
lieutenant... you ready for the press conference?
Yeah, I'm just... practicing my statement.
you want some honest advice?
I guess.
lose the speech. Just relax. Have a conversation.
you're not a formal person, so a formal statement could come off as insincere.
so you're saying I should just... be myself?
exactly.
nice shoes, by the way. They look better on.
Yeah, well, they hurt my feet.
you know what else you could use?
nice.
see you later.
brother Sam reads his Bible like I read blood, and every time he comes away with something new.
maybe if I want answers about this killer, his work deserves a second look.
such aggressive, brutal cuts. He butchered this body.
but that doesn't make any sense.
not when he was so meticulous about composing his crime scenes.
the complexity of the stitching in the belly of that fruit vendor, the attention to detail, attaching plastic to flesh.
so why would this same fastidious craftsman so carelessly hack and slash?
unless it's not the same killer.
you think one person cut up the body and another composed the crime scene?
maybe we're not looking for one Doomsday killer.
maybe we're looking for two.
this is Vince Masuka.
Hey, I've been bounced around to, like, five people, so I'm hoping you could help me.
I can try. What you need?
uh, I'm a collector, and there's a prosthetic hand for auction on buythistreasure. com.
says it's from the Ice Truck Killer investigation. Is that real?
what? No. Hang on a sec.
no, that's-- it's gotta be fake.
the only people with access to our evidence room are police employees and interns.
fuck me. - So I shouldn't bid on it, or...
no. Definitely not.
Oh, shit.
no, no, no, no, no.
what's wrong?
you stole the hand from the Ice Truck Killer evidence and sold it online?
you said it was just going to sit there. - The chain of custody is sacred.
I mean, did you ever stop to think what would happen if we ever needed to go back?
I'm sorry.
I was short on rent, and I needed the money. - Are you crazy?
I mean, I--I could lose my job over this. - No one has to know.
just... Let me make it up to you.
I'm such an idiot. For thinking you were actually into me.
I was.
I am.
get out. We're done.
and we're live in three... two... one.
my detectives are interviewing several suspects, but, uh, we won't release a name until a suspect is officially charged.
is it true the four horsemen case is connected to the murder of the fruit vendor Omar Rivera?
we're not here to discuss the Rivera case.
but the same Alpha and Omega signature was found at both crime scenes.
isn't that right?
come on, Deb. Don't go into meltdown mode now.
actually, yes, we believe that's our killer's signature.
so if you see something, say something.
call the department with any information that might help us catch this killer.
we're all in this together.
I'm not gonna lie to you about this investigation, because I don't really see the point.
I'm not into politics, and I don't care about press conferences or-- or public opinion.
all I care about is catching the fucker that did this.
shit.
that'll be all. - Lieutenant Morgan, another question.
is it me, or does our captain look happy our lieutenant just shit the bed?
it's not you. Trust me. I used to be married to her.
Hey, uh, we got one more nut-job to interview. This preacher, Jeremiah Allen.
so we got to make a house call.
all right. Let's go.
please tell me it wasn't that bad.
it was pretty bad.
is that Laguerta's necklace?
I seriously hate you right now.
Deb, hold on a sec. Hello?
I'll be right there.
your son's temperature's 104. We need to get him into surgery ASAP.
his appendix is ruptured. - And what happens now?
we'll do our best to make sure he's okay.
need you to sign that parental consent.
he's gonna be okay, right? - We'll do everything we can.
Hey, buddy, daddy's gonna wait right here till the doctors take good care of you, okay?
hello. Hey, it's, uh, Sam from Good Shepherd. Uh, your car's ready.
you said you needed it asap, so it's here.
Yeah, can I pick it up tomorrow? I'm at St. Peter's with my son.
Oh, is everything okay? - He just went into surgery.
do you need me to bring it to you,'cause I... - I got to go.
you gave us the wrong address. It was a sandwich shop.
the preacher, Jeremiah Allen. He's unlisted.
fine. Call me back.
should have taken my car. Got the GPS.
just finish up your frita so we can head back to the station.
we'd already be on the way if you let me eat in the car.
no way. You're not getting grease on Norma.
what? It was my mother's name.
now I think I know why you're divorced.
fuckin' waste of an afternoon.
you got a little, like, like, cilantro or something in the
what? Is this yours?
no. It belonged to the kid that sold me the car.
I mean, the weed, the Trans-Am.
I mean, if you're having a mid-life crisis, we can talk about it.
I'm not having a mid-life crisis. What's wrong with this car?
I think it's cool. - Yeah, it's...
what are you doing? - I'm making lemonade.
put that shit away. We're cops. We're on-duty cops.
so what? It's not like we're gonna hear back from dispatch today anyway.
I haven't smoked that shit since I was 16.
exactly, grandpa. Don't you want to be cool?
give me that.
dude, quit staring at me. You're freaking me out.
it's sad. I can feel how much your heart hurts for Deb.
Oh, dude. Get your big, fuckin' sausage hands off me. That's terrible.
got it. Thanks.
that was, uh, dispatch.
we got Jeremiah Allen's address. - Jeremiah who?
the guy. The dude. The, um-- the preacher.
right. Awesome. Where's my hat?
did you know that children who undergo anesthesia under the age of three are more likely to develop learning disabilities?
are you doing research?
and once the appendix bursts, the complication rate rises to 59%.
maybe you should get off the Internet.
you think we should call Astor and Cody, let them know Harrison's in surgery?
no, not yet. I don't want to worry them.
uh, Deb, is that you on TV?
politics or public opinion. All I care about is catching the that did this.
Oh, fuck.
sorry.
Dexter? - Sam, what are you doing here?
I figured if I had a son who was going through surgery, I'd probably want some backup too, so.
Thanks. - Brother Sam?
you came in on the Omar Rivera case.
are you guys, like, friends now?
Yeah, well, I have the auto shop. - We--yep.
I'm gonna go to the cafeteria, see if anything's edible.
any takers? - I'll browse.
how you holding up?
honestly, not good.
I hate not knowing if he's gonna be okay, not being able to protect him.
sometimes you just... got to surrender.
I'm sorry, man. That--that probably wasn't the...
it's okay. - Best thing to say.
no, it's...
if I was in your situation, I would not want to hear that shit.
I'm-- I used to not always be like this.
people used to talk to me about God.
man, used to make me want to punch 'em in they face.
Really? - Yeah, yeah.
I used to believe in something else.
what?
the same as you. My dad.
whatever. That--that didn't work out.
what happened?
Hey, you got enough on your mind, man.
you don't need to-- want to hear no stories about me and my dad.
no, I appreciate a distraction.
when I was growing up, my dad was a real popular guy.
everybody knew him.
they used to call him "mister.
he was always working, but I never really knew what he did.
so one day I asked him. I said,"Daddy, what do you do?
he looked at me and said,"Whatever I want, whenever I need. " Like that.
he said he was going to... see a friend of his.
so we get there.
he says, uh,"Now go on up there and ring that doorbell for me.
so I do it.
and this man comes to the door.
and he's staring at me, not knowing who I am or why I'm there.
and before I can turn around and say I'm with mister, my dad is standing right there behind me with a pistol in his hand.
and he takes his pistol and he points it at this man, and he shoots him in the face.
killed him.
blood everywhere.
all on my Superman shirt.
my dad just calmly picks me up, walks to the car, drives off slowly.
and he says,"You did a good job.
he used you.
no surprise I ended up in prison.
so what changed?
well, when I first got locked up, them first few months, I was just mad.
and I just wanted to hurt somebody, anybody.
and this new guy comes in.
and he's just loud and bragging, and,"Yeah, yeah, this, this, that.
I was this, this, that in the street.
and so I'm just looking at him.
I'm thinking to myself,"Okay, when I get a chance, I'ma tune this motherfucker up.
so we get yard time, and I'm following him.
and he goes into the chapel.
I sneak up on him, and I start choking him out.
I'm trying to kill him.
and then I see this light.
no, no, like, for real. Like, light.
sunlight coming through these chapel windows, and...
I could just see everything around me.
I could see where I was at and what I was doing, and...
I didn't want to do it no more.
and you think that was God?
Dexter, all I know is that when I let that man go...
I never felt that good about nothing in my life.
I'm gonna grab some coffee.
come on.
just let him be okay. Please let him be okay.
I don't know how this works, but if there's something I need to do in return, I'll do it.
okay?
you going out with that woman, aren't you?
her name is Erin.
if you like, I could cancel. I could stay here with you.
there's more work I could do.
no, we were given free will for a reason, Travis.
you can do whatever you want...
as long as you're willing to accept the consequences God gives you.
it's just dinner.
I'll be back home by 10: 00.
good night.
and your parents, are you close?
Yes, we were. They died when I was 14.
car wreck. - I am so sorry. That's terrible.
my sister pretty much raised me after that.
poor thing.
you guys are really lucky that you had each other.
I want you, Travis.
kid's a champ. Made it through with flying colors.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, uh, thank you. Thank you so much, doctor.
my pleasure. Uh, they're taking him up to recovery now.
you can see him in a few minutes.
I knew he'd be okay.
I got to go. Matthews wants to talk to me.
probably about the conference. I'm totally fucked.
long day. You should go home.
are you sure? I can hang.
no, go. I'll call you if anything changes.
okay. Good night. - Night.
thanks for staying. You didn't have to.
not a problem. I wanted to. I'm glad little man is all right.
Yeah, me too.
I know. "Thank God.
that's just an expression.
I know. Just, uh... Another marvel of modern science.
Yeah, you put your faith in God, I put my faith in science.
it's cool. We don't have to believe in the same thing, but...
you got to keep an open mind.
you may say I can't prove that God exists, but, uh...
you can't prove he doesn't.
you take care, Dex.
deputy chief?
Morgan. Did you see the news? I been getting calls about it all night.
I did, sir. Let me just say that I am truly, deeply
everybody loves my new sparkplug of a lieutenant.
they do? - You're direct. No bullshit.
well, I was just trying to get the community
you know, I took a big risk when I promoted you, Morgan.
I took a lot of crap from a lot of people.
but today-- today, you've made me very, very proud.
your dad would have been proud too.
keep up the good fucking work.
thank you, sir.
Hey.
which one of you characters drives a Firebird?
Crockett or tubbs?
you park like a dick.
you guys want to go in my office, tell me what you've been up to?
well, we'll be right in.
I've been meaning to thank you for that fashion advice.
really upped my professional factor.
Jesus, Anderson. You have something to say, say it?
with all due respect, lieutenant, you should probably watch the language.
well, for your information, Matthews said people liked it.
we have a lead.
we been speaking to this preacher, Jeremiah Allen.
turns out he's obsessed with this Revelation expert, James Gellar.
the professor. From the University of Tallahassee?
Mm-hmm. - Yeah?
found this on a Google search for "revelation expert.
it's all about end times. - Yeah.
check this out.
the posts end on the day of our very first crime scene.
I can try and get in touch with him, but
you--you can't get in touch with him, because he went underground.
underground. Why?
Ah, now look who's behind the curtain.
I, uh, called the university.
gellar disappeared three years ago after he got fired.
ask me why. - Why?
he got accused of stealing an ancient sword.
like the one Masuka thinks our killer could have used in both murders?
just like that.
Oh, and get this. This isn't just any Roman sword.
according to medieval legend, this one belonged to John the Revelator.
the guy who actually wrote Revelation.
looks like we just found our number one person of interest.
good job. - Thank you.
you knew this was gonna happen.
no. Please. Let her go. I like her.
you should have thought about that before you defiled her.
it's the best thing for her.
she's part of God's plan now.
looks like your prayers were answered.
I was desperate. - Hey, no judgment.
you already talk to an imaginary father figure.
it didn't mean anything. - Are you sure?
Harrison's okay, and you did make that pact.
come on. You don't really think there's someone out there holding my I. O.U.
I don't know.
but if there is, you'd better be ready to pay the piper.
Hey. - Hey. How's Harrison?
he's fine. He's sleeping.
are you sure? 'Cause I wouldn't want to bother you
Deb, just tell me what's up.
got a call to a crime scene in Coral Gables.
a gardner at the botanical gardens found an Alpha and an Omega outside the greenhouse.
you think it's Doomsday? - Could be.
and we might have a suspect. A middle-aged professor.
I'm not sure if I should leave. - Dexter.
sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop or anything, but if that's work, you should go.
but Harrison... - Harrison is sound asleep.
between the pain killers and the sedatives they gave him, you can probably get there and back before he even wakes up.
Dex, at the risk of sounding like the world's worst aunt, I could really use you on this.
there's blood.
I'll be there.
call me the minute he wakes up. - I will.
I was drawn to science out of curiosity. Any questions I had, the answers were already there.
but even science is never certain.
even the soundest of theories is subject to new data.
and there are some things even science can't explain.
brother Sam would say it's not an accident that I've stumbled onto a killer who seems to have his own kind of faith.
and while I don't believe in an unseen hand creating his own tableau,
I do believe I don't have all the answers.
Dex, thanks for coming. - What do we got?
blood. And fuckin' fish.
catch of the day.
it didn't get here on its own. So where did it come from?
Dex, where are you going?
over here. Check this out.
handle.
holy shit. - In here!
No! No!
Deb, wait! - Could be another trap.
Oh, God. We have to help her.
her jugular's punctured. She's already gone.
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
kill number three. It's official.
he's a serial killer.
wait, wait, wait, wait, everybody. Listen.
what the hell is that?
it's coming from over here.
locusts.
I'm not looking at Debra's middle-aged professor.
is this Doomsday number two?
but that's not the look of a murderer. That's the look of a man with true faith.
I've seen it before on Brother Sam.
whatever this guy believes, he knows it to be true.
the professor from the university of tallahassee.
gellar disappeared three years ago after he got fired.
you can't get in touch with him... 'cause he went underground.
you said gellar does the killing.
he's so much stronger than me.
gellar is pulling you toward the darkness, travis, not the light.
what you said to me made me think. - Think what?
that I don't have to do what he says. - You're free.
so when jessica morris o. d.'d, there was definitely someone in that hotel room with her.
no doubt. - Then why is laguerta on my ass to close this thing?
my god!
what the fuck?
gellar hasn't seen wrath until he's seen mine.
Gellar. He's been dead all along.
Travis acted alone.
he killed all those people.
Travis is the only doomsday killer.
and I've made a terrible mistake.
same kill wound as the other victims.
which means
Travis. You killed gellar?
professor gellar.
it is not true.
I did not kill you.
No! No.
you did, travis.
it's time you faced the truth about yourself.
he thinks gellar is still alive.
talking to someone who isn't there. huh.
I remember I came to your office.
I brought you the john the revelator sword.
Yeah, you'd stolen it.
university blamed me and they fired me. - I told you we needed it.
because we are the two witnesses... From revelation 11.
and I told you you were delusional and needed help.
I convinced you. I made you see...
that we are the chosen ones.
I proved it to you that you couldn't be hurt.
you stabbed me with the sword three years ago.
and it couldn't pierce your flesh.
no.
I didn't do that.
you killed me, travis.
and then you stuck me in the freezer.
that didn't happen.
it was him. The false prophet. He killed you.
he's trying to stop what god has commanded us to do!
and I will carry on without you.
I will finish what we started.
you were wrong, old man.
I'm in control now.
I will make new disciples that will help me.
I don't need you anymore.
I have to stop him.
what happened to saving him?
Travis' dark passenger is a part of him.
he can't be saved from it anymore than I can from mine.
I should've never listened to brother sam.
he was right about one thing.
if you put your faith in the wrong thing
it can really fuck you up.
it was a mistake to put my faith in travis.
from now on, I'm only putting my faith in myself.
it's deb.
the cops are canvassing a one-mile radius around the ip address from gellar's blog.
they're closing in.
maybe it's time to let this one go. - No!
the only way to kill a dark passenger is to take out the driver.
after everything travis put me through, he's mine.
what are you doing?
if the cops find gellar, they'll focus the hunt on travis.
it'll make it that much harder for me to get to him.
I have to keep gellar alive.
this is ghoulish, even for you.
well, if the cops found only travis' prints, they'd get suspicious.
this way, they'll find gellar's fingerprints too.
once I'm done here, I just have to strike the kill room, dump gellar's body in the swamp, and head to travis' motel.
you really think he's there?
no, but it might help me get in touch with him.
what about that?
well, it's helped me once. Maybe I could use it again.
I'll stash it in the morgue for a rainy day.
gellar's blog. - You mean travis' blog.
and now that I have travis' laptop, I can post as gellar too.
batting the beehive? You sure that's a good idea?
Travis is unstable. - I need him to engage.
this should get his attention.
I'll do... Anything... For you, dr. Gellar.
it's cool what you're doing, killing all those people. - That's creepy.
Hey, gellar. It's the end times, huh? Time for god's wrath.
well, I got some god's wrath... Right here!
Oh, yeah! End times! God's wrath.
Dr. Gellar, I've read all your stuff.
but I felt like you were just cracking the surface.
glad to see you man up, take the next step. People are always being killed in the bible.
but I'm with you...
till the end of days.
dear i was wrongyou
doomsday killer's in an abandoned church. It's too fucking perfect.
holy fucking shit. Is this it?
are these gellar's paintings?
it looks that way.
and this has to be where gellar and travis prepared their tableaus.
and held their victims.
sorry.
Deb. You okay?
I'm fine. I just need to... Get some air.
what? What? Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be there.
the cops may have found his hideout, but that won't stop travis.
that's up to me. I can't wait for him to respond to the blog.
I have to figure out his next kill.
Dex, thank god you're here.
you okay? You look kinda... Sweaty.
I was fine until I went into the church, and all of a sudden...
my heart started racing and I couldn't breathe.
what the fuck? I've been to a million crime scenes.
you remember that ice truck killer crime scene when he filled the motel room with blood?
Yeah. - I had a panic attack.
is that what this is, a panic attack? - Uh, I don't know. Maybe.
well, what was yours about?
reminded me of when my mom died.
Oh, right. Fuck, obviously. I'm sorry. - It's okay.
but that makes sense, you freaking out about your mom. Me, panicking at a crime scene?
I'm the fucking lieutenant for christ's sake.
I can't get all woozy here every time I go to a crime scene.
maybe you're pregnant. - First of all, fuck you.
and second of all, that would be the immaculate fucking conception, since I haven't been with anyone since quinn.
and lastly, fuck you.
sounds like you're feeling better.
let's go.
Travis and gellar were busy fuckin' bees, huh?
makes you wonder where god was when they were up to all of this.
it was a mistake to think that any of this religious garbage could be an answer to my dark passenger.
there's no solution here. Only clues to finding travis.
the paintings.
we got the seven-headed serpent... The four horsemen...
the angel. Quinn, nice of you to join us.
the whore of babylon, the bowls of wrath. And the sixth one...
wormwood. - What the fuck's a wormwood?
perhaps how I find travis. - It's the next sacrifice.
something about a star that crashes down to the earth and poisons mankind.
mankind? Think this one'll be bigger?
well, they used one body for the four horsemen they're not exactly going for literal.
all right, we need to find the who, the what, and the where of this a. s. a. p.
Hey, dex, there's blood.
think these could be from the bowls of wrath? - Could be.
let's test it against the samples we took from the crime scene. - Thank you, sir.
everything okay?
Matthews wants to set up a dinner sometime this week.
someplace fancy.
it sounds like he's inviting you into his inner circle. Congratulations. You're big time.
Yeah, right.
now that I've done my job, I can get on with my work.
that looks promising.
there's some more jars over there. I'll get it.
Dr. Benjamin carlson, from miami. - What do you got?
just some paint thinner.
what the fuck is chlorpromazine? Hey, anderson.
okay, I'll get back at you. - Get a line on dr. Benjamin carlson.
think travis was a patient of his. - Got it.
at least I still have gellar's blog.
the prodigal son has returned.
false prophet. " He's talking to me.
I listened to you once and I made a mistake, but never again.
I'm going to fix it.
what's his mistake?
was it straying from gellar and listening to me?
I'm psyched you could do breakfast.
one of the perks of being a nanny. Two hours off while harrison's in preschool.
I need a little advice.
I really want to show dexter my video game, you know, find out what a real blood spatter analyst thinks of it.
good idea.
I have never seen the guy make a mistake, like, ever.
so you want to impress him. - Yeah.
I mean, he's He's kind of intense. - Babe, I don't know what he's like at work, but once you seen him reading everybody poops to harrison, you realize he's a big softie.
just talk to him.
lieutenant?
I have the personal effects of jessica morris. You asked for them.
Oh, right, fuck. The dead call girl. Um...
just put 'em in my office. I'll look at it later. - Okay.
still looking into that case.
we've been through this. I'm just doing my job. - You're not.
that's the problem.
I need to figure out what travis needs to fix. What exactly is wormwood...
and who will his victim be?
okay, people, big day, so let's get started. - Are you running the briefing?
doomsday is our most important investigation, and the more I help out the more time you'll have to focus on other cases.
you're the boss.
you okay? - Peachy fucking keen.
so I understand that we found doomsday's hideout. Where was it?
in an abandoned church. - Great.
I, uh, found a hidden cellar.
I was sure it was gonna be filled with body parts but there was just some church crap and an old freezer.
sorry to disappoint you.
place was covered in prints from travis and gellar.
what about the blood in the jars? - What jars?
we found bloody jars in the trash. - Dex?
same type as travis', and it matched some of the samples we took from the bowls of wrath.
I was thinking holly benson, the girl who escaped. She thought they made her drink blood.
maybe it was from those jars.
Holly benson didn't escape.
Travis let her go because of me. - Anderson, what do you got?
anything else? - Could she be the mistake travis was talking about?
the mistake he needs to fix.
Travis is already back on gellar's path.
will holly be his victim in the wormwood tableau?
if I find holly, hopefully I'll find travis.
Dexter. Hey! Jamie and I went to your donut shop this morning.
not now, louis.
it's-it's you. - And you're doomsday adam.
it's just I I never... Imagined - Steve dorsey.
this is such an honor.
it's nice to meet you too, steve.
do you mind if I come in? I'm kind of being hunted. - Oh, right! Yep, please.
come on in.
Beth, get in here and meet our guest.
well, I hope he's hungry. I have snacks.
Oh, my - How about that?
Travis marshall. It's a pleasure to meet you, beth.
Oh, I know who you are. I've seen you on the news.
is professor gellar coming too? - No. Not today.
we were just so confused by his blog. He said this was all the devil's errand.
professor gellar didn't write that.
it was a false prophet trying to throw a monkey wrench into god's plan.
I knew it. Well, please sit down.
sorry I just have, um, velveeta and crackers. Steve's been out of work lately and...
I know how it is. Sometimes it feels as if god has forgotten us.
but I'm here to tell you that your time has come.
the faithful will be given untold riches in god's new kingdom...
if you trust and obey.
we're ready, mr. Marshall. We'll do whatever you say.
good.
but first, I need to know that you're fully committed.
Holly benson's apartment The victim who would've been.
I can stake the place out. Wait and see if travis shows up.
aren't you putting a lot of eggs in the holly basket?
I'm trusting my instincts.
something I should've done a long time ago.
doesn't look like she's here.
what if travis got to her first?
there's no signs of a struggle or a break-in.
not an ounce of makeup. No hairbrush, no toothbrush.
she could've packed a bag, gone out of town.
she still won't be safe. Travis is determined to find her wherever she is.
which is why I have to make sure I find her first.
come on, holly. Give me something I can use.
something else.
who would she be with? Family? Friends?
boyfriend.
I bet he knows where she is.
I'm guessing this is him.
Hi, I'm looking for, uh, peter grant. - Oh, my dad.
is he at home?
does it look like I have parental supervision?
he's off in spain... Or portugal maybe.
can you tell me if he knows a woman named holly benson?
she's my dad's "sex-retary. " why?
I, uh-i'm a friend. Can't seem to get in touch with her.
Yeah, well, no offense, but your friend is a total slam-pig.
right. Slam-pig.
any idea where I can find her? - I don't know.
the yacht maybe? - Yacht?
my dad has this boat that he refuses to get rid of.
probably some kind of fuck pad.
where is it? - I don't know. On the water somewhere.
Thanks.
if you do find her, though, will you give her a message for me?
nice kid.
but if she's right and holly's out on a boat alone, she's a sitting duck for travis.
time to play "find the fuck pad.
he's in spain with his wife.
if he was lying, would he let me crash on his boat while he's away?
who asked you anyway? I got to go.
Hello?
who's there?
Hello, whore.
Shh.
we're going for a little cruise.
what the fuck?
you're a fucking asshole. - I'm an asshole?
doomsday's out there searching for his next victim and you're asleep on the job.
what are you, fucking supercop? - No. I give a shit.
maybe you should try it for once, instead of going out drinking every night and coming to work while messed up.
give it a fucking rest, man. - So what...
your girlfriend broke up with you. Get over it.
fuck that. I'm just being a single guy having fun. You should try it for once.
Hey. Any leads on a wormwood victim?
we're going over to gellar's and travis' friends, relatives, and acquaintances.
figure the last two victims were personal.
good thinking. Keep at it. Any luck on the Dr. Carlson front?
turns out he passed away a couple years ago, but I got a court order releasing travis marshall's psych eval.
drugs were antipsychotics. Apparently he had some breaks with reality.
Jesus. Violent tendencies since childhood, a lack of empathy, master manipulator, delusions of grandeur.
it makes sense. Fucker wants to end the world.
what's that? - Travis' psych file.
more like psych-o file. The guy was complete sociopath.
shit, it says here the shrink thought he killed his parents.
I thought it was a car accident.
or not. Apparently travis attacked his father and grabbed the wheel.
turned it right into a tree.
any signs of parental abuse?
it's so weird. His sister seemed so convinced he was a good guy.
maybe she didn't know.
anything's possible.
he's been a monster from the start.
he's using gellar to justify his kills. - A lot of people justify their kills.
you mean me?
you justified my kills. You taught me the code.
I kept you from becoming your brother.
making me a killer was the best you could do.
you were already gonna be a killer. - I guess we'll never know.
there it is.
the fuck pad. The ricochet rabbit.
where you going? - I know this marina.
I had a freak-out at a crime scene today. - Is that unusual?
Yes, that's unusual.
seen a lot of fucked up shit and it usually just rolls right off.
but not today.
you know what's even weirder is the stuff that usually fucks me up didn't even phase me today.
like what?
like laguerta trying to swing her dick around in the briefing room.
I handled that like a champ. - Well, that's fantastic.
so why did I lose my shit when I walked into that church?
did the church have some kind of significance for you?
I don't know. The only time I go to church is to go to a funeral, you know?
my mom, my dad...
boyfriends, my sister-in-law.
so you associate church with loss.
I guess.
whatever. Doesn't matter. My brother showed up, he calmed me down.
Dexter? Was it something that he said?
I guess.
not really. It was more just him being there.
come to think of it...
every time the shit hits the fan, I go to him.
I've even moved in with him a few times.
he's your safe place. - Yeah.
since we were kids. I used to have these nightmares, and...
I would sneak into his room and I'd curl up on the floor.
he wouldn't even know I was there.
is that weird?
I don't know. Do you think it's weird?
not really. He's my brother.
I think it's sweet.
what are you gonna do?
you mean, what are we going to do. We're going to kill her, beth.
Oh! - He's testing our faith.
like abraham.
you've got it easy. He was asked to sacrifice his son.
you just have to pitch in and help kill a whore.
I don't think I can do that.
I understand, beth.
but you'll be purifying her sins.
her soul will know paradise because of your strength, your love.
come on. Let's show her some love.
Hey, dexter!
Louis got here a little early to pick me up for our date.
you have a date? I was hoping you could stay.
sorry.
I don't supposed you'd wanna have your date here.
we can't. Louis bought us tickets to go see the avett brothers.
can't go another time? - They're only playing tonight.
Hey, dexter. Uh...
I was wondering if maybe you could take a look at my game before we go.
I mean, if it's not a bad time.
I should probably put harrison down.
Oh, I got him. You take it easy.
looks like you had a long day at work.
daddy.
so... Looks like you have a minute. - Looks like I do.
awesome. I'll just-i'll bring the game up on my laptop.
uh, so... The game... Is about homicide.
and I know there's, like, a million video games out there about that.
but the secret to this game is- And I haven't even told jamie this yet- But in my game...
you can be... The serial killer.
what?
see, you have these character choices.
you can be, uh, dahmer, jack the ripper, the bay harbor butcher.
I am the bay harbor butcher. - So...
what do you think?
I think this is offensive.
who would choose to be a serial killer?
well, I mean, it's like a vicarious thrill.
vicarious thrill?
how could you possibly know what it's like to take a life?
why would you even want to?
it's a bad idea. Do something else.
so?
I'm not I'm not feeling well. I think I should go home.
and miss the show? - I'm sorry.
I'm not, uh - I'm not up to it.
still need a sitter?
this is the spot, but no boat. Which means holly is probably on it.
unfortunately, travis may be with her.
only one way to know for sure. Check the security camera footage.
I guess we all tell lies about ourselves.
security video archives.
it's got sea tracker and the password is...
Neptune. - Thank you, Mr. Grant.
how can I help you tonight?
Yeah, I kinda have a problem.
my girlfriend and I got into a fight and she took off with my boat and I don't know where she went.
I have the coordinates right here. I'll notify the police.
any way around that?
sorry, sir, it's protocol.
I know... It's just...
I don't think my wife would be too thrilled to find out about my girlfriend.
I understand. She's got a bit of a jump on you. I've got her location right here.
this... Is wormwood.
I thought it would be bigger.
so we're ready? - Not yet.
we have to cover our tracks. Police will find this place.
what difference does it make? The world's ending in four days.
it doesn't - It will only end if we complete our work.
that can't happen if we're in jail. God never said this would be easy.
guilt trip from beyond the grave.
meet me at our usual spot tonight. Love and hot kisses, t.
Sal's flowers. Sal speaking.
Hi, this is lieutenant debra morgan from miami metro homicide.
I need to know if you recently delivered flowers to a jessica morris, sent by someone with the initial "t.
Jessica morris. Here it is-dozen red, delivered morning of the 18th.
uh, that was the day she died. Who sent them?
Oh, my god. Uh, it was thomas matthews.
I'm sorry, did you say thomas matthews?
uh, what's his phone number?
Jesus christ. Thank you.
Hey, deb, what's up? - I have a situation. Can we talk?
what is it? - Not on the phone. When are you coming in?
um, not for a while. I have some personal stuff to take care of.
before you get mad - It's okay.
it is? - Yes.
you have your own life to deal with.
it seems to be filled with a fuckload of mysterious personal stuff, but...
whatever. - Well... Thanks for being so understanding.
well, I'm sorry I wasn't before.
you've got my back when it counts. I know that. - Okay.
by the way, you were right about that whole panic attack thing, so...
thank you.
I'm gonna get off the phone now so that I can have another one.
I'll see you when you get in, okay?
Louis. You're here early.
uh, I couldn't sleep. I... Got a lot on my mind.
um, I think I found a new lead. This guy-doomsday adam. He keeps posting on gellar's blog.
to all of professor gellar's faithful followers.
I can now tell you without a doubt that his prophecies are real.
my wife beth and I have been chosen to be soldiers in the final battle.
and with god's help, we will prove worthy.
this will be our last post. See you in paradise.
you think maybe gellar and travis got to this guy and enlisted his help?
I know it's a long shot, but - it's worth checking out.
you think you could track down doomsday adam's real name and address?
his name is steve dorsey. Here's his address.
good work.
I'll call quinn, go check it out.
at least someone around here appreciates me.
Hey, it's quinn.
for the fourth fuckin' time, answer your phone.
I'm not calling again, just get here.
sergeant batista, miami metro homicide. Are you Mrs. Beth dorsey?
Yes, that's right. - Is your husband home?
no, he's not. Is there something wrong?
I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.
are you aware that your husband has been posting on a blog by a professor gellar?
gosh, maybe you should talk to him when he gets back.
how about we start with you and we take it from there?
found the fuck pad.
why is he in a hazmat suit?
you're too late.
wormwood can't be stopped. - No!
this was supposed to set things right.
so you're telling me that this was all a joke?
the videos your husband posted as doomsday adam, the whole... Chosen thing?
my husband has kind of a strange sense of humor. - Yeah, I would say so.
Steve's been out of work lately.
he was hoping the videos might go viral and get him some attention, and I just wanted to be supportive.
Mrs. Dorsey, these murders are nothing to be joking around about.
your husband wasted valuable police time and resources that could've been spent catching the doomsday killers.
I am so sorry. I will talk to steve-tell him to get those videos down.
this will not happen again. - I'd appreciate that.
if this was all a joke, why do you have all these books by professor james gellar?
what are we gonna do? He's a cop.
he doesn't enforce god's law. We do.
it's a sign.
Miami metro homicide. That's where god wants us to stage wormwood.
nothing to tell you what wormwood is going to be.
I don't care what it's gonna be, i wanna know where it's gonna be.
I have to fix this.
Holly. But this doesn't look like wormwood. She was stabbed, not poisoned.
you're still too late. She's already dead.
Travis is gone and you killed the wrong guy. When you gonna let this go?
when I kill travis.
are you sure you can make that happen? - Isn't that what you taught me to do?
I didn't have a choice. - According to you, I don't have one either.
well, you have a choice to make right now. Maybe you should call the police.
I told you, I don't call the police. Travis is mine.
Dexter, don't make this personal.
Methylphosphonyl difluoride? - And isopropyl alcohol.
mix them together, they're lethal. - Poison gas.
this is wormwood.
this could kill who knows how many people. - Dexter, you have to call the police.
why would I listen to you? I'm only here because of you.
now I'm supposed to trust your judgment? I'll make my own decision.
Dex. - Leave me alone!
brother sam said it.
sometimes you have to surrender to something greater than yourself.
9-1-1. What's your emergency?
the doomsday killers are hiding out on a yacht at 114 bleaker canal road.
and who's calling please?
our primary suspect is Sergeant James Doakes.
he is not your man.
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher is alive and still in Miami.
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, end of story.
I found a blood slide at a crime scene exactly like the ones we found in Doakes' car, and Doakes never had a boat.
here is a list of Miami Metro personnel who still do.
its point of origin--front center mass burned upward, downward.
can we close the doors?
this void, it's the same thing that happened with the first car victim.
"Bobby"? Maybe the victim was letting us know who did this.
you fucked my girl? - You know, you could learn a thing or two from her.
she takes her job very seriously.
have you always been this afraid of the water?
ever since my father thought that the best way to teach me how to swim was to march me down to the local pondand throw me in.
that's horrible.
six years old, and I already knew what it felt like to be dying.
look, I think you have the wrong idea. - Shut up.
I know who you are. I know what you are.
Dexter, you don't have to save her.
you shouldn't even be with her.
it's not even like you will have a fucking future.
all I know is that, when I'm with you, I feel.
safe.
the dark...whatever
I saw him, and he was coming through the flames.
he was wearing a silver-colored suit. - That's our phantom arsonist.
he looked like an alien. - Or a monster. I swear, he was 7 feet tall.
monsters, aliens, phantoms--none of them are real.
the thought that an actual person could do this is too awful, so our imaginations create a way to make it easier to take.
but even the strongest of imaginations can't protect us once we know the truth.
I called you last night. I wanted to go over the facts of the case.
we can go over them now. - Where were you?
Oh. You were with Hannah.
find anything? DNA? Prints? - Nope, nada, zip.
same accelerant as the other four fires, though--kerosene.
and he left another "Bobby" scribbled in the soot.
fuck, that's five "Bobby"s in two weeks.
I mean, he's gotta be signing his name, right?
I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense.
none of the victims were named Bobby, but, I mean, fuckload of good that does us. There are thousands of Bobs and Roberts in Miami.
what do we know about the latest victim?
mom took her daughter to the bathroom. They both went up in smoke.
kid was six years old.
what kind of sick fuckdoes that to a six-year-old kid?
maybe the kind who isn't botheredby the sight of a dead child.
how you feeling? You get your stitches out?
Yeah, I'm going to have a really sexy scar.
how was your day? - It was fine.
you don't sound fine.
the phantom started another fire today. It killed a mother and child.
what? - Why do I get the feelingyou want to wrap him up in plastic?
doesn't matter. I promised Deb I wouldn't take any cases from the police.
well, if you always listened to Deb, you wouldn't be here with me.
I can't kill him, okay? - Okay, ne.
sorry.
I'm just frustrated.
as much as I want to be here with you, my dark passenger really wants to be somewhere else.
I'm sorry. Your dark what?
my dark passenger. That's what I call my need to kill. - Why?
because it's like this thing living inside me, telling me what to do, saying I have to kill, not leaving me any choice.
you're not a puppet. Of course you have a choice.
actually, I don't.
come on, Dex. It's just you.
you're the one who wants the arsonist dead.
and I don't blame you. Who wouldn't?
it's not the same. - Well, what do you mean?
ignore that. I-I want to understand this. How is it different?
cause a lot of people feel like they want to kill somebody, - but I have to follow through. - I follow through, and I don't have a.
dark passenger. - You don't get it.
I'm trying to.
but, no, I don't get it.
there's a man in the window. - What?
Hi, Banana! - Oh, my God. That's my dad.
I'm sorry if I surprised you. I didn't even know Hannah had a boyfriend.
I don't know why you would. I haven't spoken to you since
go ahead and say it. Since before I went to prison.
Clint McKay, convicted felon. Nice to meet you.
no need to get nervous. I was just in for check kiting, and I got out early on good behavior.
dad, what are you doing here? - Well, let me just get to the point.
I don't know what Hannah's told you about me.
not a lot. Just that you almost let her drown.
well, the truth is,
I was real, genuine asshole of a father.
and I needed to admit that to you in person.
dad, can we please not do this in front of Dexter?
no, if you two are together, then I-I want him to hear this.
I spent a lot of time with a prison shrink, working through my issues.
he said it's important to take responsibility, so that's what I'm here to do.
okay.
now, I don't expect you to forgive me.
I don't see any reason that you should, not after everything I put you through.
but it's important you know, no matter what, I always loved you.
I always will.
I've got something for you in my truck.
let me give it to you, and I'll be on my way.
surprise.
it's your dollhouse, repainted and rebuilt.
it was in your Aunt Cindy's garage.
I figured you loved it so much as a kid, you might like to have it now.
Dex, give me a hand?
well, I guess I'll be on my way, let you twoget back to your dinner.
there's a diner at the Purple Flamingo, where I'm staying.
they say they make a pretty decent burger.
okay.
okay.
I guess I'll see you around then.
nice to meet you, Dexter.
you look good, Banana, happy.
glad to see you're doing okay.
I'm sure he meant well, but he could not have given me a worse gift.
brings up so much shit.
what kind of shit? - When I was eight, he took me to a poker tournament, lied to my mom and said that we were going to a county fair, and stashed me in a motel room.
went to play cards and didn't come back for three days.
that's awful.
when he came back, he brought the dollhouse, bragging about a big win, saying that he'd never leave me again, and making promises that things would get better.
and did they? - No. Of course not.
I don't know.
I'm--he's trying, right? Maybe -maybe this last stint in lockup did him some good.
Yeah, maybe.
most likely, we're lookingfor a male suspect.
egocentric, manipulative, possibly in or on the outskirts of law enforcement.
he's methodical.
fastidious in his appearance, poor social skills--this list is by no means comprehensive.
but it should give you a pretty good ideaof what we're looking at.
Bosso's profile of the phantom--he may as well be describing himself.
an arsonist who works for the fire department. It's almost too easy.
what else?
hands-on learner, prone to self-aggrandizement.
thank you, investigator Bosso.
where are we on tracking the fireproof suit?
Oh, there's at least 100 sites that sell that on the Internet.
almost impossible to trace.
are you guys still interviewing witnesses?
Yeah, but nobody's seen the guy's face.
we got more people coming in today though.
let me know what you find out. Simms, Miller, any leads from the tip line?
none so far.
mostly girlfriends trying to get back at their exes.
all right. Keep at it. Maybe something will come through.
in the meantime, this fuck has killedseven people in two weeks.
let's stop him before he makes it to number eight.
Hannah's wrong. Of course I have a dark passenger.
there's no other way to explain this compulsion.
hannah: meeting clint for coffee with me luck XOXO
Dexter: luck
I hope she knows what she's doing.
who's sending you hugs and kisses?
no one.
bullshit. That was a girl. Was she sexting you?
you got pictures? Come on, I gotta restock my spank bank.
Hey, Angel, do you know anything about Dexter's new girlfriend?
who, Hannah McKay? - How did you--Jamie told me.
my man.
Hannah McKay! Yeah, that is so awesome.
excuse me, but what is so fucking awesomeabout my brother dating a killer?
you guys heard Sal Price's recording. Hannah confessed to murder.
Oh, come on, she was only 15 when she did that.
I mean, when I was 15, my parents still thoughtI was retarded.
Hey, hey. I get it.
Hannah is an attractive girl.
but you should probably be careful.
Yeah, you--you should definitely be carefulof getting burned because she's so freaking hot.
can I see you in my office, please?
I didn't realizeyou and Hannah McKay had gone public.
we hadn't, until a minute ago.
well, that's kind of dangerous. Don't you think?
dating someone so notorious out in the open like that, the radar. when you're trying to stay under
Deb, I really don't want to talk about Hannah right now. Can you just leave it?
fine, yeah. I'll butt out.
I mean, we're all responsible adults, right?
you live your life, I'll live mine, and Hannah will live Hannah's.
great. And you'll leave Hannah alone?
I'm saying that I'll stay out of your relationship.
I'm not going to let that woman get away with murder again.
that's not what I meant. - Dexter, I am fucking serious.
I have compromised the shit out of myself for you.
I am sure as fuck not going to do it for Hannah McKay.
fine. I get it.
why are you standing here? We have a phantom to catch.
PRAZOLAM 0. 2-DEBRA MORGAN
she did say "we."Philip Bosso.
in his last 27 arson investigations, he found the fire's origin point.
either he's great at his job, or all he had to do was look in the mirror.
okay, it says herethat you work as a janitor at the Y in Brickell Bay where the, uh, phantom set the first fire.
did you see anything suspiciouswhen you were making your rounds that night?
no, I didn't even know it happeneduntil I saw the fire truck. It was horrible.
right. Right, right, right. And did you see anyone in a fireproof suit?
don't you think I would've told you if I had?
Bosso's S. U.V. But where did he go?
is he about to strike again?
electric fuses and camping fuel.
what are you doing here?
that's not a fireproof suit.
Dexter, you a Civil War reenactor too?
you here for the battle?
Yeah.
which side you fighting for?
the North. - You Blue Belly.
I should buck and gag you right here.
were you there last weekendat the Sixth Maine Battery cannon firings?
no, damn. I guess I missed that one.
it's a whole weekend affair.
I was in charge of special effects--ground, air bursts, artillery fire.
which explains what's in his carand gives him an alibi for Saturday's fire.
want to see some pictures? - You bet.
Bosso's not the phantom.
he's just strange.
but if he didn't set those fires, then who did?
hang on just one sec.
hannah: having dinner w/clint. dane's in south beach wanna join?
Dexter: c you soon
I guess coffee went better than expected.
after coffee, Hannah wanted to show me the Flower Mart.
so we're walking around, and I catch a whiff of this flower.
it smells just like licorice.
so I ask Hannah what it is--And I tell him it's anise.
so I tell the lady in the booththat her anise smells delicious.
except you didn't quite pronounce it right.
I don't know exactly what I said, but she did not react well.
well, do you blame her?
sounds like you had quite a day.
Yeah, uh-- we, uh, we really did.
so, Clint, how long are you going to be in town?
Oh, just another day or so. And then I'm off to Louisiana.
Oh, uh, what's in Louisiana? A poker tournament?
no. I am all done with that. I am looking for an honest way to make a living.
and I think I found the perfect thing. You ready?
crawfish.
crawfish? - Yeah, a crawfish farm.
I got a line on one near Lafayette.
I'm going to call it "Big Clint's Crawdaddies,
and I will ship 'em to you freshanywhere in the country.
there's a market for that? - You bet your balls there is.
ain't nothing like a crawfish boil--weddings, bachelor parties, fourth of July.
everybody likes crawdads.
well, I am excited for you, Dad.
and I'm proud of you.
well, thank you, honey.
means a lot.
well, I'll tell you what. Why don't you check out of that moteland come and stay with me while you're here?
you're starting a new business. You're going to need to save your money now.
no, no, no, no. I couldn't do that. I-I wouldn't want to intrude.
Oh, you're not. - Yeah, don't worry. I was going home tonight anyway.
why don't I bring you guys breakfast in the morning? Best doughnuts you ever tasted.
okay.
what the hell are you doing, man? - Get out of here.
man, it's like I died and went to heaven.
I think if I had one more of those, I probably will.
I'd like to make an orange juice toastto the cutest damn couple
I have ever seen--outside of me and Bubba in prison.
that's just a little joke.
right. - Well, to you, Dad, the king of crawfish.
there's no stopping me.
I just gotta get the money together.
so where are you at with that?
well, actually, that's something I wanted to talk to you about.
I figured you might like to get in on the ground floor.
what do you mean? - Well, you know, invest.
I only need about 20 grand more.
no, it's a great opportunity.
I mean, there's a guaranteed 10% a year backon your investment.
I'm sorry, Dad. I-I can't.
all my money's tied up in the business.
Aw, come on, now. Not all your money.
I mean, there's got to be a little wiggle roomin there somewhere.
I'm sure you could remortgage your place. - I don't think so.
no, this place has got to be worth a pretty penny.
dad, it's not going to happen. - Well, fine.
whatever. Forget it.
I'm sorry. I just don't have the funds.
what kind of daughterwon't even help out her own fucking father?
Jesus, Dad.
look, I need some air. I'm going to go for a drive.
dad, you don't have to go.
you think I was wrong, telling him I couldn't give him the money?
of course not. - But I feel like I should help him out.
Why? - Because he's my dad.
the same dad who almost let you drown?
who left you alone in a hotel for three days?
he's trying to change.
I doubt it.
look, I know he's done some bad things, but there's good inside of him, as well.
Oh, right, you've known him for, what, 24 hours, and you think you understand him?
well, I have a sense for this sort of thing.
Oh, yeah, you and your dark--whatever-- part of you.
that you don't think exists. - Because it doesn't.
I gotta go to work. It's the arsonist again.
look, I'm just trying to help here.
I know. I know. I appreciate it. I'm sorry.
I'll be fine. Go.
okay.
another "Bobby."
"it's Bobby." He added an "it's.
like we didn't know it was Bobby.
make sure you get this.
did you see Bosso? He was sniffing the body.
probably for accelerant.
still, it was kind of creepy, right?
I mean, I know it would be the biggest cliche in the world, the arson investigator turned out to be the arsonist, but does he--does he set off anything in your lizard brain?
I don't think Bosso's the phantom.
he has an alibi.
you vetted him? - I looked into him.
you said you weren't going to takeany more cases from the police.
I didn't take it. - Fuck, Dexter. Why would you put yourself in that situation?
good question. Why did I?
Hey, L.T. We got the security camera.
I'm going to take the hard drive back down to the stationand see if we can get eyes on the phantom.
good. We could use a break.
Hey, Hannah.
wait, hold on. Slow down. What happened?
I'll be right there.
what happened?
I came back from the Flower Mart, and it was like this.
Oops.
well, I had a couple of drinks to take the edge off, but I guess I might have overdone it a little.
you did this to get back at mefor not giving you the money that you wanted.
Oh, talk about paranoid. But then, maybe you've got reason to be.
must be a whole lot of folks hate youfor all the pain you've caused.
how can you even say that to me?
playing mother nature in herewith your stupid, little flowers, won't even help out your own fucking father!
because I don't want to help you!
you got any idea what it's like to be the father of the infamous Hannah McKay?
you're a goddamn curse, you ungrateful little shit!
that's enough, Clint. - You stay out of this. This is family business.
you know you killed your mother, don't you?
she died of a broken heartafter your spree with Wayne Randall.
I'm sorry.
everybody would have been a lot better offif I'd let you drownthat day at the pond.
get out of here.
now.
fine.
I said what I had to say.
well, it looks like Hannah's found herself another winner.
you two deserve each other.
I can cut a body up into pieces, but how do I help Hannah put herself back together?
could you have picked more of a dump?
come on, Maria. It's perfect for all this cloak and dagger bullshit.
it's the kind of place you take hookers and ugly broads.
and also, nobody sees you.
you should know, I followed upon all the names you identified on my list.
Yes, the list of suspicious police employeeswho own boats.
Yes. They were all dead ends.
all except for Dexter Morgan, who conveniently moved his boat right when we were closing in on his marina during the official Bay Harbor Butcher investigation.
you really think Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher?
it's worth looking into. - No, it's a waste of time.
now, look, you have to start thinking logically.
if Doakes really wasn't the Bay Harbor Butcher, - then that means that somebody probably framed him. - Right.
which means that same person probably killed him, most likely the real Bay Harbor Butcher.
so the best thing to do is to lookinto Doakes' final days.
we should start with the cabin in the Everglades.
where Doakes died.
makes sense. First let's eat.
okay. - Waiter.
you went all out.
well, you had a rough night. I figured you could use a pick-me-up.
sit.
you were right about my dad.
I'm sorry I was.
I just-- I feel like such a sucker.
you know, I don't fall for anybody's bullshit, but when it comes to him, I
I get it. Fathers can be complicated.
I just don't understand why I keep holding on to this ideathat, underneath it all, he's a good person.
maybe because the idea that he's notis just too hard to take.
well, I just hope he's gone for good.
you sure scared the shit out of him.
that voice
I hadn't seen that look on your facesince you took me to see the snow.
is that what you were talking about?
your dark rider?
dark passenger.
okay, fine. It sounds a little silly when you say it out loud.
no, I-I get what you mean, you know. You do seem like a different person, so it makes sense that you would name that part of yourself.
does it just take over?
where do you go?
does Dexter Morgan just disappear?
no, I'm still there.
do you hear a voice, or -Not exactly.
it's more like a need.
so it's just like a feeling.
well, I should get to work.
unless you need me to -No, I'm good.
I got pancakes.
okay, the good news is that we havethe phantom entering the bus.
the bad news is that he never shows his face.
my promise to Deb is getting harder and harder to keep.
this is more than just a feeling.
there's no way to I. D. him? - I didn't say that.
right there.
he grabs a rail bare-handed. We might have a print.
pull the fucking print off the rail, and we might get lucky and get a match.
all right. Let's go, bro.
Hey, baby. What's up? What?
motherfuck. I'll be right there.
what's wrong? - Fucking Novikov's sending Nadiato work at a sex club in Dubai.
he's holding her at the Fox Hole. I gotta get her out of there.
you're going alone? - I got no choice. He's putting her on a flight tonight.
you're going to need backup. Let's go.
where do you think you're going? - I'm here to see George.
why don't you stay here?
well, well, if it isn't Sir Lancelot.
Where's Nadia? - Nadia?
let me go get her for you. She's got something to tell you.
get over here.
all right, tell your boyfriend who you belong to.
let her go.
tell him. - Fuck you.
you touch her a-fucking-gain, you're dead.
Oh, what are you going to do, Mr. Policeman?
you're going to shoot me in my own club?
- Fuck.
don't move.
Nadia, get behind George's body.
I want you to take this gun, Nadia
I want you to shoot me in the arm. Okay, sweetie?
it's okay.
shoot me in the arm.
what the hell-- are you okay?
I'm fine. He pulled a gun and shot me. I had no fucking choice.
he just grazed me.
Christ. - Go to the safe.
get your passport and the money and go.
what? She's a witness. I'm not going to let her take that money.
she's earned it. She can't be a witness. The Koshkas will kill her.
and she's here illegally.
I'm sorry. - It's okay. Go, go, now.
so did you find a match?
we'll see. I'm running the phantom's prints through A. F.I. S. now.
nothing. - Fuck me.
so what now?
you hand the whole thing over to meand let me take care of it my way?
I can't stop thinking about this "Bobby" thing.
you know, that somehow, that's the key.
it's a kid's name. Nobody calls an adult Bobby.
he wrote "it's Bobby" on the bus.
sounds like Astor and Cody, blaming each other."It's Astor." "It's Cody."
you think the fires have something to dowith his childhood?
could be. Maybe his urges started back then.
I wish we could run that print against the juvie records, but that shit's sealed.
back to square one.
not for me.
government workers never miss a break.
there's your phantom.
arrested for burning down his school's gym at age 12.
spent some time in detention, set his roommate's bunk on fire.
got sent to a psychiatric facility in 2006.
that explains why the fires only just started now.
you going to turn that over to Deb?
call it in on the tip line?
I'm not sure I can. Deb was right.
now that I have proof, my urges are beyond my control.
your dark passenger. Where did you come up with that, anyway?
I thought I got it from you.
I gave you the code.
the dark passenger was all yours.
you said it got into me too early, in that shipping container.
like you thought I was possessed.
I meant you were traumatized, Dexter. Not possessed.
I remember the first time you said it. You must have been about 12.
I just let it go.
I couldn't let you blame yourself for feelings that were too complicated for a young boy to understand.
but you're not a boy anymore.
you sound like Hannah. - Maybe she's right.
maybe the dark passenger is just a feeling.
it can't be. - Why?
because if there's no dark passenger, then I'm responsible for everything I've done.
it sure is a whole lot simpler to just pin all the blameon something else, isn't it, Dexter?
it's much scarier to think that the dark passenger is no more real than I am.
this is where the cabin used to be.
Yeah, before it got blown to smithereens.
I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta from Miami Metro Homicide.
this is Thomas Matthews. - What do you want?
were you the owner of this property back in 2007?
and did you rent it, at that time, to a James Doakes?
the Bay Harbor Butcher.
no, no, no, no, no. I told the cops back then, I had nothing to do with that.
then how did Mr. Doakes come to be staying here?
I was renting the place to Santos Jimenez.
some kind of Colombian drug guy.
not that I knew it at the time. I would never rent to a criminal.
of course not.
now, why does that sound so familiar?
now I know why the name Santos Jimenez rang a bell.
he wasn't just a drug runner.
he was one of the three men responsible for killing Dexter Morgan's biological mother, Laura Moser.
Moser? - Yeah.
some drug lord put a hit out on her because he found out that she was Harry Morgan's C. I.
she was butchered by Jimenez with a chain sawright in front of Dexter and his brother Brian.
the Ice Truck killer, that was Dexter's brother?
Yeah.
so that means that Dexter watched his mother get chopped up, just like the Bay Harbor Butcher chopped up his victims?
so what are you saying?
Where's Jimenez now? - He disappeared.
murdered by the Bay Harbor Butcher? - Maybe.
so who was more likely to want Jimenez dead, Doakes or Dexter?
Oh, come on, Maria. - No, Tom.
we can't ignore the facts.
the Bay Harbor Butcher took blood slides from his victims.
Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.
and Doakes always thoughtthere was something off about Dexter.
what if Doakes was on to him?
Jesus. What if Dexter is the real Bay Harbor Butcher?
what if he isn't?
I am going to go question him.
no, no, no. You're not going to do that.
now, I don't think you're right about this.
trust me, I hope I'm not.
if somebody's got to talk to Dexter, it's going to be me.
I've known him since he was a kid. He trusts me.
what's more, I'm a lot less likely to fuck it up.
the only thing that stands between meand killing the phantomis a slightly deflated water wing.
you sure we can't talk you into coming for a swim?
Yeah, I'd love to, but I got something I gotta take care of.
here, put your hand through there.
boom.
do this one too.
- There you go.
well, well. Who's this big fella?
that's my son, Harrison.
Harrison. Isn't that fancy?
and who are you?
I'm Jamie, Harrison's nanny.
boy. They didn't have nannies like you back in my day.
we're going to go swimming now.
you ready? Ready, little man?
boy, the way they coddle kids today.
you know, they're all going to be expecting a helping hand.
the world isn't like that. It's sink or swim, Sonny boy.
have fun.
what do you want?
well, Dexter, I can tell that you care about my daughter.
I'm just here to find out how much. - Get to the point.
I have some informationthat could be very damaging to Hannah.
now, I could givethis information to the police, or you could pay me a nice, tidy sumto keep it to myself.
what are you talking about?
when Hannah got out of juvie, she killed a counselor at a halfway house.
she fed him rat poison.
her roommate, little gal named Arlene Shram, saw her do it with her own two eyes.
I figured the cops could get her to spill her guts.
you're lying.
I read Sal Price's book on Hannah.
he mentioned the counselor but nothing about the roommate.
because I hadn't told him about it yet. - What?
where do you think he was gettingall those juicy, little plums?
price was paying me to dish dirt on my daughter.
but I was saving the good stuff for a bigger payday.
then the son of a bitch went belly-up, and. pfft.
there went my meal ticket.
you'd sell your own daughter outfor a crawfish farm?
fuck crawfish, man. I'm up to my ears in gambling debt.
but you do what you gotta do.
so you going to give me my money, or do I send Hannah to jail?
get out of here before you see my bad side.
you might want to ask Hannah about Arlenebefore you come to a final decision.
then we'll talk numbers.
what exactly were you doing here?
it was a personal matter.
my girlfriend works at the club.
Jesus, Quinn.
I came here to talk to Novikov about Nadia. The conversation got heated.
he pulled out a gun and shot me. I returned fire. Self-defense.
plain and simple. - Well, write up a report.
I want it on my desk in the morning.
there's a little problem with your story.
there was a time lag between the first shot and the second.
I want the truth.
I told you the truth.
I went down when George shot me.
he started to beat the shit out of Nadia.
I reached for my gun.
he wheeled around, ready to blow my head off, and I took him out.
that's what happened.
okay. Then we'll go with that.
minus Nadia.
Hey. Where's Dexter?
I don't know.
but I'd like to point out the factthat I am here, doing my duty.
what? - Nothing.
I feel like I'm going to be sick.
how can that be my own father?
I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, but I needed to know that he was telling the truth.
Arlene Shram is the only personwho can put me in jail.
she saw me put poison in that counselor's food.
I'm going to have to pay him.
that's not going to solve anything. He's just going to come back.
well, I don't see any other option.
when other people have threatened you, you've found other options.
I can't.
he's my father.
I'm going to call my bank.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm not thinking anything.
Clint McKay doesn't meet the code.
but Joseph Jensen does.
it's not as much funwhen you're not wearing your suit, is it?
Who-who are you? I can't see you.
maybe I'm a phantom.
then again, maybe not.
a phantom can't hurt you.
Oh, God. Please don't.
who's Bobby? - Let me go.
stop whining. Who's Bobby?
Bobby Hamilton, my best friend when I was 12.
that's when you set your first fire.
I didn't set it. Bobby did.
it was all his idea.
but then he died, and I got caught.
they sent me to the nuthouse, like I was crazy.
it's all because of Bobby. Fucking asshole.
so does he still talk to you?
is Bobby the one telling you to set these fires?
no, that would make me crazy, and I'm not fucking crazy!
but I only hurt people because of Bobby.
no, you're the one who's setting those fires.
you're the one who's burning people alive.
you can't blame it on somethingthat happened to you when you were a kid.
you're not a kid anymore.
it's time for you to take responsibility.
fuck.
the caller said they smelled kerosene.
looks like we have the right place.
holy shit.
that's Joe Jensen. I interviewed this guy.
dumb fuck must have passed out from the fumes.
he's still alive.
I guess we found our phantom.
who'd have thought it would be so easy?
Yeah.
guys, come on down.
got your call.
glad you came to your senses.
you got my money? - Yeah.
it's right back here.
what's with all the plastic?
you'll find out soon.
what the hell?
I realize this isn't the best wayto make a good impression on your girlfriend's father.
but I can't allow you to hurt Hannah.
Oh, please. I won't talk to the cops.
I'll leave town. I promise, I'll never come near Hannah again.
I wish I could believe you.
actually, I don't,'cause then, I couldn't kill you.
Oh, please, you don't have to do this.
that's what I'm realizing.
I don't have to. But I want to.
even though you don't meet my code, I really, really want to.
because, unlike you, I care about Hannah.
you got the devil inside you, boy.
no, I think it's just me.
sink or swim, daddy.
Hey, Deb. - We arrested the phantom, thanks to you.
now I know why you weren't at the Fox Hole.
consider it a gift.
bullshit.
you want something in return.
and I'm guessing it's for me to lay off your girlfriend.
well, now that you mention it.
forget it.
I always give in to you.
but not anymore.
I understand.
I got the money for my dad.
I left him a message. He should be here soon.
he won't be coming. - How do you know?
I had a talk with him.
I made it clearthat I wouldn't allow him to hurt you anymore.
and I think he understood.
so he's gone?
he won't be bothering you again.
thank you.
the dark passenger has been with meever since I can remember, pulling the strings, running the show.
but as it turns out, I'm no puppet.
and you should know, you were right.
about what?
the dark.
rider.
he doesn't exist.
turns out, maybe you understand mea little better than I understand myself.
I love you.
I think I love you too.
Hey. I need your help.
we need to find a woman named Arlene Shram.
sure. Who's that?
according to a message I got last nightfrom Hannah McKay's father, she's a witness to a murder.
Dexter, what the fuck?
maybe we should just get rid of the body.
we can make it look like a suicide.
how do we do that?
there's a station nearby. - I'll go get a couple gallons.
if Doakes really wasn't the Bay Harbor Butcher, the best thing to do is to look into his final days.
we should start with the cabin in the Evergladeswhere Doakes died.
Maria's convinced that Doakes was innocentand that the real killer might be you. - Me?
do what you gotta do.
that was the Department of Corrections.
Hector Estrada is up for parole. - Estrada?
remember I told you about my mother and how she died?
was he one of the men that killed her?
he was the leader. He gave the order.
maybe it's the universe giving you a Christmas present.
no one but you would see it that way.
you're working with her, aren't you?
that fucking cop bitch. The one that got me out.
Laguerta? - She fucking set me up.
you're not the one who was set up.
Debra's at St. Joseph's in Hialeah. She's been in a car accident.
well, I sure as shit didn't swallowa handful of pills.
she what, poisoned youwhile she was at your house last night?
we need to find the proof.
Hannah dissolved the pills into Deb's waterso that she'd pass out behind the wheel.
Sal price's pen.
if you test it, you'll find traces of aconite on the end.
I can't believe you're gonna turn her in.
as long as she's free, you're not safe.
you should have killed me.
surprise, motherfucker
you look like you got some sun.
the boat.
they treating you well?
I get ten minutes outside.
my cellmate seems nice.
she robbed a liquor store so she could buy some meth.
look, you have every right to--- You said that you loved me.
I do. - Then why am I here?
you poisoned Debra.
because she was trying to keep us apart.
and what was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
but I know you could have just broken up with me.
and completely free you up to kill Deb? No.
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life behind bars.
you left me no choice. - You had a choice. You were supposed to choose me.
she's my sister. - Oh, Jesus.
I never stood a chance.
don't.
why are you even here?
I had to see you.
if you're worried I'm gonna tell people what you are, then don't worry.
your secret is safe with me.
is it?
I would never do that to you.
I came here because I wanted--I needed you to know...
if there was another--any way to keep Deb safe,
I would have found it.
I miss you so much.
I miss you too.
you're the only person in the worldI don't have to hide anything from.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without you.
Dexter, it's not too late.
the only thing they have on me is that fucking pen.
if the pen disappears, so can we.
we can go some place that your sister can't find us.
we can go to Argentina and be together always.
I can never trust you.
but, you just -And you know you can never trust me.
we both knew it would come to this. One of us dead or behind bars.
Yeah.
except I always thought it would be you.
sorry.
Yeah, me too.
goodbye, Dexter.
I tried to kill Hannah, but couldn't.
I wanna hate her for what she did to Deb, but can't.
Hello? - An inmate from the Miami-Dade Sheriff's Departmentis trying to contact you via collect call. Do you accept the charges?
Yeah. - Connecting.
Arlene, thank God. - Hannah, what is it? What's wrong?
I can't do this. I can't spend my life in here.
I need you to help me. I need this to be over.
no, you're stronger than that. You haven't even had your trial.
I--I can come visit you. - Arlene, you owe me.
I took care of the counselor for the both of us.
and now I need your help, okay? I can't live like this.
tell me what to do.
I don't know who's worse, you or him. It is toy-mageddon every time I walk in here.
he can't make up his mind which one he likes the best.
he's a boy. He wants them all.
I can clean this stuff up.
go, get ready for work. I got it.
all right, Harrison. We're gonna need to let Jamie pick some things up, but that doesn't mean you can't play with Thomas.
I want Hannah.
sweetie, uh, Hannah had to go away, but that doesn't mean that she doesn't miss youvery, very much.
okay?
here, let's see if we can get Thomas to talk.
captain? - Dexter.
what are you doing here?
it might be best if you take Harrison to another room.
because?
because I'm placing you under arrestfor the murder of Hector Estrada.
Maria, this has to be some sort of mistake. - - I wish it was.
who the hell's Hector Estrada? - I need you to stay back.
you get your hands off of me. - Stay back.
Jamie, just take Harrison to his room.
please. It's okay.
I'm calling Deb.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say or docan be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
what the hell's going on?
Jesus. LaGuerta arrested Morgan.
Maria, what are you doing?
out of my way, Angel.
why is Dexter in handcuffs? - I have proof he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Doakes is the Bay Harbor Butcher. Have you lost your mind?
Dexter, what is this?
I don't know. - What the fuck?
she thinks that your brother's the Bay Harbor Butcher. How is that even possible?
it's not. Williams, take those things off his fucking wrists right now.
leave those. - Maria, what are you doing?
stand down, Lieutenant.
Dexter's my prisoner. You're family. You need to recuse yourself.
let's go.
angel. - I'm on it.
just so we're clear then.
your official statement is that you went fishing last night and then went straight home to be with your son.
I didn't kill Hector Estrada.
no.
you didn't cut his body into piecesand put it into bags, take it on your boat, and then throw it into the ocean?
why would I do that?
because Hector Estrada butchered your motherin front of you.
so how about you start telling me the truth?
I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.
he's answered all of your questions. You've got nothing here, Maria.
not all my questions.
these are from my phone last night.
and that's you carrying plastic garbage bags onto your boat.
it was ice to keep any fish I caught cold. My cooler broke.
but earlier today you said you didn't catch anything.
what was in the bag?
it was a shirt with Hector Estrada's blood on it, and his wallet.
you killed him. You killed him like you killed all your other victims.
admit it-- you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Dexter, don't say another word. - That's enough, Sergeant.
I was throwing away my dinner.
it was a bag from Franco's. You can check.
angel, you gotta believe me. - You framed Doakes.
after I defended you against him.
you betrayed me, this department, everybody around you.
is that what this is about?
your desperate need to believe the James Doakes you knew, or thought you knew, wasn't a cold-blooded killer?
you don't have the right to speak his name.
you're so hurt.
angry, scared.
he's dead because of you.
you were his partner. And his Lieutenant.
his lover.
what if you couldn't see what was right in front of your eyes? What does that say about you?
I swear to God, Dexter,
I'm gonna nail you to the wallfor what you've done.
Maria. - To the wall!
Maria, that's enough.
God damn it, Lieutenant. You can't be in here.
tell them what you just told me.
I reran the blood on the shirtthat Captain LaGuerta discovered in the trash.
it's definitely Hector Estrada's, but after going over it, I found an evidence number.
what what evidence number?
the shirt you gave me with Estrada's blood on itis the shirt he was wearing the day he was brought in, back in '73.
things got a little rough, and the arresting officers broke his nose.
that's impossible. -I checked inventory.
the shirt's missing.
what about his wallet?
please don't kill the messenger. There was a partial print.
and it's yours.
were you trying to frame my brother? - Deb.
you son of a bitch. You set me up. - Maria.
can I go now? - Yes, you can.
he did this! He's the Bay Harbor Butcher! He has to be.
this witch hunt of yours is fucking over.
and if you have a problem with it, Captain, we can take it upstairs.
captain.
everyone else may have boughtyour little victim routine in there, but we both know the truth.
and the truth is it's been a very long day.
you set me up, just like you did James.
and I'm sure you've already managed to kill Estrada, which leaves me no chance to prove any of this.
Congratulations. You've won again.
I just wanna go home and see my son.
James always knew there was something wrong with you.
surprise, motherfucker.
you got my reports?
hot off the presses.
headlines. 26 stab wounds. The first pierced her heart.
whoever did this - was making a fucking point.
this is our third vic.
any suspects?
Walter Munro. Fucker's crazy.
thinks he's some kind of philosopher or some shit.
always scribbling his fucked up thoughts in his journals.
hmm, the victims are all prostitutes. The wounds suggest the same weapon.
it is consistent with a single killer.
the thing is, he's crazy, but he's smart too.
I can never get anything on him.
hold up.
Sup?
what we...talked about.
come on, Maria.
don't you at least wanna think about it?
I'm sorry, James.
Oh, shit, Morgan. I didn't even know you were there.
you're, like, invisible.
if only I had stayed invisible.
Maria, wait up. - Angel.
Hey. - I-I don't wanna hear it.
I just checked with Estrada's parole officer.
you were behind his release from prison?
somehow, Dexter figured out I was watching him.
SOSMaria
everyone thinks that you're trying to frame Dexter.
I-- - Dexter.
I don't care what everybody else thinks. - Well, you better start caring.
do you want to keep your job?
of course I want to keep my job.
well then, you better back offand drop this whole crazy idea.
angel, I--I need you to be on my side.
I am on your side and that's why I'm telling you this.
but you have to stop.
okay, it looks pretty bad, doesn't it? - More than pretty bad.
and you're gonna have to workreally hard to fix this.
but come on, Maria.
if anyone can work their way out of a jam like this, it's you.
thanks for your advice, Angel.
we need to talk.
Harrison just went to sleep.
I'm glad one of us will sleep tonight.
how about a heads up the next timeyou're gonna get yourself arrested?
or make our Captain look like a fucking lunatic.
it worked, didn't it?
everyone thinks LaGuerta framed me.
she won't be able to come after me anymore.
and all it cost her was her career.
how many careers has LaGuerta destroyed?
it still doesn't make it right.
not that I even know what that is anymore.
I wish it hadn't come to this, but it was either her or me.
she almost caught me trying to kill Estradain that shipping container on the docks.
whose fault was that?
LaGuerta's the one who set me up.
so you repay the favor?
would you prefer my normal method of conflict resolution?
not fucking funny.
look, there was a problem and I solved it the best way I knew how. And it's over.
that's what you keep saying.
but what about Hannah?
what about her?
well, I assume she knows what you are.
well, her arraignment's tomorrow.
how do you know she won't use that as a bargaining chip to get a better deal?
she won't. - How do you know that.
cause she's in love with me.
pray to fuck you're right.
take tomorrow off, all right?
at least until the dust settles with this LaGuerta thing.
you know this isn't over.
despite what LaGuerta thinks,
Estrada's still out there.
Yeah, I know.
it's been six days since I let him go.
I haven't found him yet.
if he resurfaces and LaGuerta gets wind of it
she'll offer him a deal.
put him up in some safe house.
and you're left having to explain to the D. A.
why you came after him with a chainsaw.
I'll find him.
I'll do what I have to do.
you sound like Hannah.
according to Estrada's parole officer this is the last known address of his wife.
Hector has nowhere else to turn.
he's wanted by the police, me...
Mrs. Estrada,
I'm Arthur Curry, Hector's parole officer.
why are you here?
I haven't seen Hector in years.
Hey, honey, who's that? - The neighbor.
please, don't come here again.
my Tony doesn't like it.
well, if you haven't seen Hector, why are you still married to him?
I'm catholic.
is it that guy again?
you sure he hasn't been around?
it's been 40 years, but Florencia hasn't let go of Hector.
sometimes it only take a moment to reveal who we really are.
looks like you spun a goddamn web.
it's more like a puzzle.
so connect the dots.
can you pin this on Munro or not?
the entry wounds on the victim are consistent with the puncture wounds on the previous victims.
uh, she was standing when she was attacked.
she stumbled, her body turning.
and the killer's behind her now, stabbing her in the back repeatedly.
and then she's down on all fours, crawling away until the killer grabs her and flips her over.
he's on top of her now.
he slices her carotid artery.
she's terrified. Heart's racing.
it's releasing more blood in thick arterial spurts here and here and here.
I've never seen someone so excited about a crime scene before.
you like this blood shit a little too much.
I'm just doing my job.
then wipe that fucking smile off your face and help me find the creep who did this.
I let my guard down.
for an instant, my real life bled into my fake life, and Doakes caught his first glimpse of the real me.
thanks for coming, Tom.
christ sakes, Maria.
it's all over the station.
you tried to frame Dexter.
you know that's not true.
do I?
the commissioner's going to open an investigation into your recent conduct.
if called to testify I'll be dragged into this mess and have no choice but to tell the truth
that we found definitive proof in that boathouse that Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher, and that despite me advising you to cease and desist, you continued on this reckless course.
so what's your advice?
get on your knees and start kissing anything that even remotely resembles an ass.
I'm serious, Tom.
I was hoping for your support.
and make myself look as crazy as you?
people still respect you here.
I need someone to have my back, Tom.
and you could say I had reasonable suspicion.
you carried it too far.
well, then say that.
say that due to my overzealous nature as a police officer, I got too caught up in the case.
you got too caught up being an idiot.
I'm already down, Tom.
stop kicking.
my job is at stake.
all right.
I'll see what I can do. - Thank you.
you just keep your head low.
and for God's sake, start doing your jobif you have any hope of keeping it.
lieutenant.
what brings you here? I'm the arresting officer.
how's the wrist?
stronger every day.
how's facing life without the possibility of parole?
last time I checked it's innocent until proven guilty.
well, this is your last chance.
you can save yourself a lot of time and troubleand confess what you've done.
I will if you will.
my conscience is clear.
all that Xanax.
my, how you must have trouble sleeping at night.
you don't know shit about me.
can we have a minute?
except that you're the lieutenant of homicideand you wear a big shiny badge, and yet you know exactly what your brother is.
don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone. They wouldn't believe me even if I did.
but knowing that you have to live with itis, um, punishment enough.
still, I'm curious.
how do you justify arresting me and not him?
or is the law just somethingthat you make up as you go along?
turning a blind eye whenever you feel like it, or whenever Dexter is involved.
Fuck...you.
you are a liar and a killer.
but not a hypocrite. - Ms. McKay, come on. Let's go.
Hannah McKay, you are charged with murder in the first degreein connection with the death of Salvador Price.
how do you plead? - My client pleads not guilty, Your Honor.
ms. McKay, you are hereby remandedto the state of Florida, and bail is denied.
No!
I'm so sorry. - Listen to me. It's gonna be fine, okay?
ma'am, you need to step back, please.
thank you. Good-bye.
Maria, just checking in.
that's nice of you.
seems everyone else is avoiding me.
you know how it is.
everyone is waiting to see where this lands.
I'm doing everything I can to make sureit doesn't land on my head.
you need to show up to my party.
I really don't think anyone wants to see me there.
of course they do.
it's also an opportunity for you to apologize to Dexter.
a public act of contrition.
if you straighten it out with him, he can tell the people upstairsthat it was just a misunderstanding.
either way, show up tonight.
it's not just New Year's Eve. It's also my retirement party.
it wouldn't feel right without you.
I'll be there.
1, 500 ccs, supercharged...
shit! What the fuck?
Seward Memorial Hospital, now!
she's having some sort of seizure.
she seems stable. We're bringing her into Seward Memorial emergency right now.
we'd better contact her next of kin.
hang on, sweetheart.
go ahead and get her an MRI, make sure it's with contrast.
let's hope my hunch is right.
that the pull of a long-past romanceis enough to compel Florencia to help Estrada.
you wanted to talk.
Deb, come in and have a seat.
what's up?
you were right.
about? - Me.
I let my feelings for Sergeant Doakesaffect my decision-making.
what I put your brother throughwas negligent and unforgivable.
and I'm sorry.
if it's any consolation, my career is gonna take a hit.
suspension, probably worse.
I hope not.
you don't have to say that.
either way, in the event I'm not around much longer,
I wanna leave things in some kind of order.
I was trying so hard to prove that the Bay Harbor Butcherwas still active,
I overlooked some loose endson Travis Marshall's death.
I was hoping you could help me with the timeline.
sure.
okay, according to Dexter's statement, previous to the day we found Travis Marshall's bodyhe was doing his final forensics sweep on the church.
Yeah, that's right. - Under your supervision.
No...I mean, yes, I sent him, but he was on his own.
he doesn't need someone to watch him.
you didn't go to the church that day or evening? - No.
you sure?
Yes.
when I was going through the mail this morning, I got a package from Mike Anderson's widow.
and it seems that before Mike died, he ordered security footage from all gas stations around the church.
and.
somehow this got lumped into his personal belongings. It recently got sent to me, so.
can you see that?
that's two blocks from the church.
and there's a timestamp.
it was 22 minutes before the fire department got the callon the burning church.
what were you doing there, Lieutenant?
what it looks like. I was getting gas.
then why lie about it?
I didn't lie. I forgot.
it was a crazy night.
you were certain about it a moment ago.
no I'm--I'm sorry.
I--I took some food to Dexter at the church, but I was only there for, like, 30 seconds.
so I didn't think that it was worth remembering.
and then you got some gas. - Yes.
that you put in a gas can?
Yeah.
why in the world--Captain, where is this going?
that's up to you, Lieutenant.
Debra. we've known each other a long time.
is there something you wanna get off your chest?
Yes.
I think you've been under a lot of stress.
you know what I think?
I think I'm not the only one who made a mistaketrying to protect someone they care about.
is there anything else, Captain?
not for now.
but this is just the start of a much larger conversation.
count on it.
I guess some bonds are unbreakable.
we never leave behind the ones we love.
he could be there all day.
and you can keep that, all right?
Hi, Deb.
okay. Give me 15 minutes.
she's still unconscious, but the seizures have stoppedand we've got her stabilized.
we're waiting for a doctor. - We could use your help over here.
okay.
LaGuerta knew I was lying, Dex.
wait, wait, let me think.
what? - This is bad, Deb.
I don't wanna fucking hear you say that. You always say that you can fix it.
I will.
just don't know how yet.
look, it was dangerous enough when she was focused just on me, but now that she's pulled you into this, well, it's worse.
tell me about it.
I know I've said this a hundred times -But you're sorry that I got involved in this.
I am.
are we really that fucked?
look, all she knows is that you bought some gas.
that's not a crime.
Yeah, but buying gas to burn down a churchto cover up the fact that you killed Travis Marshall is.
and she knows that.
but she can't prove it.
yet.
I need to know what else she has, what her next move is.
if all she's got is that DVD, I can handle this.
is this ever gonna end?
Yeah, it will.
just go back to work. Try and act normal.
normal? What the fuck is normal?
just do the best you can. I'll deal with LaGuerta.
what the hell is that? - Estrada.
Oh, shit. Let's go!
this is Officer Armes calling for backup.
we need units at Seward Memorial.
LaGuerta's house. What is it you're hoping to find, Dexter?
I don't know.
not this.
warrants.
with a judge's signature.
allowing LaGuerta to track the GPS on my phone and Debra'sthe night the church burned down.
once this warrant goes through,
LaGuerta will have a timelinefor the night I killed Travis Marshall.
she'll know that Debra went to the church, then the gas station.
and then back to the church.
proving that we both were at the church when it burned down, and proving that Deb was my accomplice.
I think it's time to run, Dexter.
but Dab. I can't leave her behind.
take her with you.
Debra and Harrison-- just go.
you knew one day it would come to this. - Deb could never live like that.
that's always been the plan, Dexter.
that was before.
it's not just Deb.
I don't wanna run either.
before? Before what?
before everything.
before I married Rita, before I had a son, before Deb knew who I was, before I fell in love.
what difference does any of that make?
somewhere along the line, the fake life that we createdas a cover for me to kill became real.
it's not fake to me anymore.
I don't want to lose it.
I'm gonna stand my ground.
I don't see any other options here, Dexter.
but I do.
no. Dexter, you have never done a kill like this.
I'm about to.
no.
LaGuerta's an innocent.
she doesn't even begin to meet the code.
it's the only option.
I can't let Deb go down for what I've done.
my God, Dexter.
how did we end up here?
morning, Dex.
gonna pick up some steaks and beer tonight, yeah?
sounds good.
Hey, Morgan, the kind of doughnut you choosesays a lot about a man.
you might want to avoid Doakes. He's in a bad mood.
first the LT dumps him, and now his prostitute killerseems to have gone missing.
I love these. - Thanks.
get one while they last.
I don't want no fucking doughnut, Morgan.
sorry.
hell, it's not you, it's LaGuerta.
I should have never gotten involved with her to begin with.
never jump the fence if you're not willingto face what's on the other side.
where the fuck did you hear that?
a friend said it to me in a moment of stress.
bullshit. You don't have any friends.
this is the journal of that motherfucking hooker killer, Walter Munro.
I took it from his place a couple of weeks agowhile serving a warrant.
it's been locked up in my drawer ever since.
never jump the fence if you're not willingto face what's on the other side.
I've come to believe that the killer could be one of my former patients.
he sent both packages to you.
maybe he doesn't know how to find me.
yet. - Well, I need to get to him before he gets to me.
I've got my eye on Joey Quinn. - Quinn?
there's no way he can pass that sergeant exam.
he'll pass.
I stuck my neck out on the line for you.
you'd better not fuck this up.
lieutenant Morgan?
is there a problem, officer? - Well, yes.
you're in a car, drunk, with an open container.
Quinn. - Why did she call you?
she's a friend. I couldn't say no.
I mean, come on, you used to fuck her.
there is nothing going on between me and Deb.
I want to know if there was anything unusual about my father's death.
he killed himself, Dexter.
Harry walked in on what he created, and he couldn't live with himself.
trust me when I say that there's a place in this world for your son.
I told you, you're perfect.
how can you still say that when you know what I've done to Deb?
I shot the wrong person in that trailer.
your sister just confessed to killing LaGuerta. - What?
I'm telling the whole fucking truth!
there's nothing you can do to stop me!
Deb, please. - Stop...!
I thought I could fix this, but you're right...I can't.
I just keep making her worse.
do you really think you can help her?
Yes.
scar Tissue.
stop!
do it, Debra. Shoot him.
this is not who you are.
you are a good cop.
you're a good person.
you're not like him.
put him down!
it's true.
everything she said.
you're a good person.
it's okay. Do what you gotta do.
tell me what you saw.
I don't want to talk about it.
Debra, I brought you here so we can begin to strip away the power this place holds over you.
talking about it's not gonna change anything.
neither is continuing to repress what happened here.
I'm not repressing shit.
and I sure as shit don't need you to remind me about what happened here.
you know, Dexter's need to kill was born in a container much like this one, and he's been trapped inside its walls ever since.
as a psychopath, he will never be able to break free.
but you can, by reliving the events of that night over and over...
I killed him.
I shot Dexter instead of LaGuerta.
that's what I saw.
now, unless you're gonna fucking handcuff me again, I'd really like to go.
when you shot Dexter, how did that make you feel?
better. Worse. I don't fucking know.
what does...what does it even matter?
I mean, LaGuerta is still dead.
what else could you have done? - Arrested him.
splendid, now your brother is on death row. Go on.
we could have run. - Only to eventually be caught.
you go to jail, Dexter gets the death penalty again.
Debra, you've become so obsessed with the life you've taken, you've forgotten the life you saved.
of course you're fucking defending him.
you fucking created him.
you're using him to track a serial killer.
this isn't about Dexter or me.
this is about you getting better.
maybe I don't fucking want to get better.
I don't believe that.
why the fuck should I even trust you?
why the motherfuck do you even care?
are you upset?
Yes, I am.
good.
at least you're no longer avoiding your feelings.
we're done for now.
for today.
there are countless ways to inflict physical trauma on the human body, and sometimes the deadliest wounds are the ones we barely see.
they run deep, like the ones I've inflicted on Deb.
what are we looking at?
well, most of the blows are to her face.
there's some bruising around the neck.
it doesn't look like there was much of a struggle.
no signs of a break-in.
Yeah, given the lack of defensive wounds and the close proximity of her attacker,
I'd say you're looking for someone she knew.
we have a name? - Norma Rivera.
landlord said she lived here by herself.
just got off the phone with the vic's employer.
she was a housekeeper in Biscayne Bay.
nice zip code. - Yeah, um...
they all said she had an ex in and out of her life, Roberto Sagastume.
me and Miller can swing by his place.
he had a record.
it's good to see you taking the initiative, like any good sergeant should.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Yo... You got my test back?
you nailed it, bro.
now wipe that stupid grin off your face before Miller sees it.
Yeah...no, I've just never been this happy to get back a positive test, you know?
what does my sister see in you?
Half-pint. Before I forget, there was this little hottie asking for you back at the station earlier.
and you seem surprised, why?
said she'd come by later.
they always come back for more.
Hey. Any word on Deb?
Yeah, Dr. Vogel says she's still day-to-day.
let her know I was thinking about her.
I will.
she's gonna be okay.
opening shop. A run.
caffeine. All morning routines.
but lately, mine consists of coming here, waiting for the woman I left my sister with to do what I couldn't...
make Deb whole again.
thank you. - How is she?
well, you still remain the focal point of your sister's pain.
I want to see her. - No, I think it's better you continue to keep your distance for now.
it's been almost a week.
Dexter, I am still not sure if your sister has hit rock bottom yet.
what is it?
I just want you to prepare for the possibility that Debra may never be able to have you back in her life.
no.
I won't... just let her go.
so, have you had better luck with our killer?
I crossed off three more former patients from your book.
who's next on the list?
chapter seven. - A. J. Yates.
I'll check back in once I check him out.
according to Vogel's book, he attacked a classmate with a chair at 12.
institutionalized at 15.
seems Vogel tried to channel his violent tendencies, but he was beyond her help.
eventually, he was transferred to another hospital.
now Yates seems to be a productive member of society.
he's a bundler... cable, phone, Internet.
but I need to know if murder is part of the package.
there's nothing here.
nothing in Vogel's notes about brain surgery.
his scar.
is that the mark of one of her "unconventional methods"?
thanks for letting me use the treadmill.
better you than me.
I'm not much for running in place.
is that your shrink way of saying that I have been?
is it? Care for some tea?
how about something stronger?
come on, I just ran four Miles.
what's one beer?
the drinks and the drugs were keeping you numb, making the symptoms of your PTSD worse.
ass off the table.
how long are you expecting me to stay here?
I see a lot of your father in you.
Harry wrestled with the same doubts regarding Dexter.
you're not as alone as you might think.
honestly, I don't see what the problem is.
he had everything laid out on his bedroom floor.
Dexter saw in the paper how this guy got off on a technicality, so he was stalking him, vetting him.
even found a kill room in an abandoned house near the park.
just how we taught him.
what did you tell Dexter?
that this guy was too high-profile.
that he'd be missed, and that Dexter would have to wait.
he went along with my decision...for now.
is this ever gonna be right? What we've done?
I mean, Dexter isn't a kid anymore.
he's becoming a man.
he's gonna kill.
we knew that day was coming.
but what happens when I finally tell him it's okay?
what happens when he finally knows what it's like to take another person's life?
the code will do what it was designed to do...
allow Dexter to be who he was meant to be.
but what if it doesn't?
what if the code doesn't keep him in check?
what then?
what if this has all been some horrible mistake?
obviously, Harry came around when he realized, what else could he have done?
locked Dexter away in an institution?
or do nothing until he took an innocent life?
or protect your brother, giving him the tools that he would need to channel his urges.
the same way you protected Dexter in that container.
it's not the same. You're wrong.
Deb. - I can't just accept it.
I'm not like him. I'm not like you.
Dexter...Dex... Dexter is fucking Dexter.
Debra... Harry did not make a mistake saving Dexter's life, and neither did you.
that night in the container,
Dexter was being exactly who he was meant to be, and so were you... a loving sister.
I... - Will get through this.
can I keep that tape? - Yes.
he had everything laid out on his bedroom floor.
Dexter saw in the paper how this guy got off on a technicality...
Dexter, you shouldn't be here.
I was vetting Yates.
what did you do to him? - What are you going on about?
he has a scar on his head exactly where your killer has been harvesting brain fragments.
is he another one of your little experiments?
we can talk about this, but not here.
not with Debra in the other room.
an X-ray revealed a lesion on Yates's brain.
I suspected it was contributing to his violent behavior, so I... I suggested the new hospital remove it.
I never knew whether they even performed the surgery.
when I do what I do, I have to know everything.
sorry for the oversight.
now, why don't you tell me the real reason you're here?
you could have just called for the scar.
is it regarding what I said about letting your sister go?
Dexter, I assure you that I'm not judging your relationship with Debra.
I'm just trying to manage your expectations.
why, because she thinks I'm a monster?
you think I don't know that I'm the one responsible for the pain she's in?
that's why she's here with you.
you have to get her to forgive me.
whatever it takes, you have to find a way.
I need her in my life.
you need her? - Yes.
I understand that you love Debra, in your own way.
in my own way. - But why do you think you need her?
I just do.
Deb looks up to you. Isn't that what you said?
she used to.
and that made you feel good about yourself?
Yes.
well, no wonder you feel so lost.
Debra became a mirror, reflecting a positive image of yourself that you used to balance out with the notion of yourself as a monster.
now that mirror is cracked, and the only reflection you see is one of darkness.
you make it sound like that part of me isn't real.
you are no monster. You never have been.
anyone on my table would disagree.
Dexter, a monster, by definition, is outside of nature, but you're a part of the natural order of things, with purpose, and value.
a right to exist.
and when you come to accept that, you'll no longer be dependent on Debra, or anyone's, validation.
I'll still want her in my life.
want, but not need.
no van. No Yates.
no one home.
Monterey Nursing Home.Dad's 76th birthday.
it seems Yates found a way to keep his family in his life.
will I be able to do the same with Deb?
Vogel says I don't need her.
but if that's true, will I be able to let her go if that's what she needs?
women's shoes.
Hello? - It's me.
I'm at Yates's house.
have you found something? - Women's shoes.
individual shoes, not pairs, some of them older.
high heels are a far cry from brains.
it's not exactly your killer's usual M. O.
if you recall when all this began,
I expressed my doubts that this was the work of someone new to killing.
Albert wouldn't be the first to alter his methods.
Yeah, still, something about it doesn't quite add up.
but, just to be safe, I'm pulling prints off the shoes.
I'll run them through the station's database for missing persons and homicide victims, but they're only partials.
I won't expect anything back until the morning.
and I have my son tonight.
understood.
I'll let you know what I find.
she found herself a hero.
Hi.
hello.
you must be Dexter. I'm Cassie, 4-B.
and you're in my kitchen because?
I'm a friend of Jamie's and I ran out of laundry detergent.
daddy!
I see you two have met.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, who am I to deny a neighbor clean clothes.
so, dinner's in the oven. I'll see you in the morning?
sure. - I'll walk you out.
nice to meet you, Dexter. - You too.
Bye!
she's nice.
but does she have a kissy-neck?
I knew you would pass! - I didn't.
Oh, thank you for that.
this one used to have to write the combination of his station locker on his wrist for a month when he first got here.
so what? My memory sucks.
all you needed was the right encouragement.
I don't even want to know what that means.
we're empty.
you know, I really am so proud of you.
I couldn't have done it without you.
you wouldn't believe who was behind the wheel...
Debra Morgan, the former Lieutenant of Homicide, passed out, piss drunk.
come on, Joey... Joey, just let it go.
man, I don't really know who was fucked up more, her or the parking meter she ran over.
how about a little professional discretion?
Yeah, well, I believe that we're off the clock.
no, I know, but you could lower your voice, you know?
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Thanks.
who's that guy? - I don't know.
I think he used to bone her or something.
probably the way Morgan made lieutenant...on her back.
that's enough!
enough, I said!
what the hell happened?
someone was defending his ex-girlfriend's honor.
get him out of here.
you know what? It's fine. - I'm sorry.
let's just go.
Hey, how about a round on the house?
all right, lieutenant. - Fuck.
So...we're good?
ow, babe...babe, my ribs. - Yeah?
I'm so sorry.
how many, mister? - Two.
one for me, and one for Dan.
two it is.
sorry I'm late.
who's Dan?
pet elephant. You don't see him?
you want some pancakes, Dan?
eat up.
make sure Dan doesn't get any syrup on the couch.
okay.
my car died.
that "check engine" light I kept ignoring?
apparently, it means what it says.
how did you get here?
angel. But, don't worry.
my car will only be in the shop for a few days.
I'm gonna see if Cassie can give us a lift to Harrison's preschool.
you know, you made quite an impression on her last night.
impression?
she's single. Just saying.
Hey, why don't you take the SUV?
it's safer. I'll clear my stuff out.
if you can drop me off at the station, I'll pick up a car from the motor pool.
sure you don't mind?
I don't if Dan doesn't.
how did I let you talk me into this again?
I believe your price was one beer.
so, now what? - You tell me.
isn't this where you think you belong?
no.
frankly, I'm quite amazed that you think you ever left.
are we really gonna do this?
Debra, you shut yourself inside these walls for the last six months, doing your damnedest to shut everything and everyone out.
so, why don't we?
what the fuck are you doing?
I want you to convince me how killing Dexter instead of LaGuerta would be a better choice.
open the fucking door.
she was on her knees, where those blood stains are, isn't that right?
she was your coworker, your friend.
why didn't you just stay at the party and let Dexter take care of everything?
I had to stop him.
but Dexter can't help what he is.
he has no conscience, unlike you.
you knew the moment you pointed that gun at LaGuerta it was wrong, and still, you pulled the trigger.
you shot a woman in cold blood.
you let her bleed out and did nothing.
you shot an innocent woman for simply doing her job.
because of Dexter.
and that's what terrifies you the most.
you so desperately want to believe that if you had just shot Dexter, then you wouldn't have to face the hard truth that if you had to do it all over again, you'd still choose him.
because in your heart, you know you will always choose Dexter.
how do I make it right?
by finally accepting that you're a good person who was forced to do a terrible thing.
and that you made the best of an impossible situation.
you can walk out that door. You can move forward.
the choice is yours. It always has been.
Oh, lieutenant.
a word? - Of course.
I was just reviewing the sergeant's exam results, and it seems you were right and I was wrong about Quinn.
apparently, he can count past his fingers and toes.
he was in the 85th percentile.
so was Miller.
in the 88th percentile, to be exact.
I want you to strongly consider making her sergeant.
Angie is good. I like her, a lot.
but I'm still thinking Quinn's the smarter choice...
all I said was "Strongly " consider.
this is your first departmental promotion as lieutenant, and it will reflect on your command.
that being said, it's your decision and yours alone.
three hits off the partials, all reported missing.
Janet Thorton, taken two weeks ago.
looks like Yates killed these women, but I still can't be sure he's the one after Vogel.
not until he's on my table and we have a little talk first.
where are we on Norma Rivera?
we're trying to find... - Miller.
address for the ex-boyfriend is no good.
so far, nobody's seen him.
got back the M. E.'s report. They found semen.
I'm testing it to see if it's a match for the ex-boyfriend.
would explain why he's off the grid.
she invites him over... - Things get heated, he kills her, panics, and goes on the run.
that's one theory, anyway.
okay, let's find this guy.
we're on it. - "Dex"bose.
Favor...I need you to stay away from the lab for a bit.
that little hottie who's been looking for me is coming up the elevator, and we might need a little alone time.
no problem.
Yeah, you would know all about that.
you're better than that.
come on, here.
there's a 20 in it for anyone who directs her to my lab and is cool about it.
done. - Okay.
I'm on my own. Perfect.
I get it, okay? You're pissed about last night.
I had to run a tab so that asshole patrolman wouldn't press charges.
do you realize that if Matthews would have caught wind of this, he would've had all the ammo he needed to shoot down this promotion?
I'm sorry. I lost my cool.
well, I need my sergeant to be able to keep his.
a bar fight?
technically, your place is a restaurant.
come on, it's not like you haven't done the same.
I mean, you put a guy in the fucking hospital for running his mouth about how LaGuerta was using hers.
allegedly. And the difference is, I wasn't up for promotion.
I had already made sergeant.
you want to fix this? Solve this case.
excuse me? Are you Vincent Masuka?
the one, the only.
but, you can call me Vince... just as long as you call.
okay. I'm Niki.
I'm a student at "U" of "M.
Oh, yeah. My Alma Mater.
come in.
you must be majoring in...beautiful.
this is really hard. - I know the feeling.
I think you may be my father.
you were a sperm donor in college, right?
but you have curls.
Yeah, my mom.
holy... Oh, fuck.
this was a bad idea. Sorry.
okay, that's embarrassing.
it's okay. No, don't worry.
it's okay, don't... don't...don't...don't... it's okay. Don't worry about it.
Oh, my God.
you've got my soulful yet haunting eyes.
night, Marty.
see you tomorrow.
we do have filing cabinets, you know.
this is kind of my process.
what are you even doing here?
I thought you were taking time off.
turns out, time off isn't all it's cracked up to be.
I just wanted to get a head start on some of the cases that you left for me.
well, we're gonna need food.
we? - Yeah, we.
you look like you could use a hand, and I'm starving.
you know, when I need a break, I've got maybe two days at the most.
and then I go crazy.
I end up right back here.
what about you?
what makes you crazy?
family shit.
nothing says family like love... and shit.
unfortunately, my father was an expert in the latter.
Texas oil. - Texas oil?
fuck, I hope I'm holding my plastic fork correctly.
exactly.
he was all rules, all the time.
my moving to Miami to be a cop, that was about the biggest "fuck you" I could think of at the time.
I'm sure you understand my dismay when I got out of the academy and I realized it was nothing but rules.
everybody there was probably just like your father.
you know what the worst part was?
I knew I had made a huge fucking mistake, but there was no way in hell I was gonna give him the smug pleasure of knowing he was right.
so I waited until he died, quit the force, and opened up this place.
looks like you're doing pretty well for yourself.
trust me, I'm still the black sheep.
the look on my mother's face every time she goes into the country club, has to explain to one of her friends that her son is a P. I?
that's gotta be pretty close to priceless.
my dad was everything to me.
I loved him.
and while he's not the man I thought he was...
well, I'm... I'm realizing we're more alike than I thought.
to dead dads.
long may they haunt us.
it's a better toast if you open it.
I'm good.
Vogel says I'm not a monster...
but that's exactly the part of me she's expecting to remove Yates as a threat.
a threat that seems to have left in a hurry and taken all his shoes.
does this prove Yates is who I'm looking for?
the only way to know for sure is... find where he's hiding.
he saw me here, heard everything.
bone saw. Specimen jars.
his own cut-by-numbers guide.
Yates is the brain surgeon.
Vogel needs to know.
I know her. I pulled her print.
Yates must have stabbed her, nicked her left pulmonary artery, left her for dead, unaware cramming her inside that cart would put pressure on the wound and stop it from bleeding.
now I have to do the same.
it'll hold, but not for long.
do you think the girl will be all right?
she lost a lot of blood, but I stemmed the bleeding and I dropped her off in front of the E. R.
I got back here as fast as I could.
Oh, God, has he been doing all this because of me?
we can't know until we find him.
let's hope there's something on here that'll tell me how...
these are patient files.
your patient files.
that's not possible.
this last one's dated just two weeks ago.
Dexter, don't.
what is this?
you were keeping notes on me?
it's a journal. I've always had a journal.
you were writing down everything we did, everything we talked about. It's all in here.
I never used your name.
yates, nor anyone else for that matter, could possibly know who you are.
somehow, he's deluded himself into thinking his feelings for his sister are genuine, unaware there are no real emotions behind them.
Dexter, I... I never meant...
what am I, a subject for another one of your books?
is that what these are for?
answer the question!
my notes... it's how I process...
you were experimenting on me with Harry, and you still are.
I'm nothing but a lab rat, just like Yates.
that's not true. You know that.
is that why you want to keep me apart from Deb?
you know, just another way to isolate your subject, see what he'll do?
Dexter... - Don't.
when Yates is dead, you are out of my life.
it's over. You understand?
or do you need to write it down?
I understand.
I walked into the room, and...
go on, tell me. - The blood.
Evelyn, there was so much blood, on plastic.
Dexter had placed it everywhere. The walls, the ceiling.
there was a table in the middle of the room.
a table with... - The body?
parts of one.
and when Dexter turned, the look on his face... he...he was so proud.
When...the man Dexter killed, he was a drug dealer.
he murdered your partner.
he was going to get away with it.
but he was a person.
who, according to the code, deserved...
no one deserves to be in pieces... in bags.
the code is a theory, an idea.
but what I saw... what Dexter did... what we did!
I don't think I can live with this.
fuck, and I'm supposed to?
C - Hello? - Mr. Yates?
Yeah, that's me.
I'm afraid we have some bad news.
your father's heart is failing.
how bad is it?
we think you should come quickly.
he might not have much time.
dad.
I got here as fast as I could.
I'm right here. Can you hear me?
it was you?
I was counting on you being the good son.
they'll be here any second.
room 26, code blue!
we're losing him. We're losing him!
to save his own life, Yates was willing to take his father's.
Vogel believes I'm just like all her other experiments...
a psychopath who can't form real connections.
but she's wrong.
Deb isn't a prop, like Yates's father was to his son.
she's more than a mirror. She's family.
if I have a purpose, and value, and a right to exist, so do my feelings for Deb.
this experiment is over.
Vogel can go to hell.
jamie packing you a lunch these days?
it's for you.
I just came back from Good Samaritan.
I need you to run the blood on the clothes of a stabbing victim, Janet Thorton.
she still alive? - Still in surgery.
and the son of a bitch who stabbed her broke all of her toes.
how soon do you need this? - Very.
on my way back to the hospital now to get a statement as soon as the docs say she's out of the woods.
let me know what comes back on those clothes.
will do.
what the fuck?
you here to see Dex?
Yeah.
everything okay? 'Cause last time I saw you...
Yeah, I am sorry about that.
I'm so sorry I put you in that position.
I'm sorry I got so mad at you for calling Dex.
no, it's okay. I mean, you asked me not to.
I was in a really bad place, but, uh...you know, you were just looking out for me, like you always do.
things are so easy with you.
I wish it was like that with Jamie.
I just keep getting tripped up, you know?
you all all right?
eh, she's jealous.
she thinks there's still something between us.
make it work with Jamie.
I want you happy.
you mean so much to me, Joey.
don't you fucking forget that.
Thanks.
you sure you're okay?
I gotta go.
good-bye, Joey.
the body forms scar tissue to close a wound.
has my sister begun to do the same?
eventually, scars fade. Who knows?
with enough time, you may not even remember how you got them.
Hey, Deb. What's up?
we should talk. It's important.
Yates can wait. My sister can't.
sure, I'd like that.
just, not here.
can we take a ride?
it's good to see you.
Vogel said it was best I stay away.
what the fuck does she know?
if it's any comfort, we're not on the best of terms anymore.
she doesn't understand us, Dexter.
exactly.
she said I might lose you... but we'll always be together, right?
Vogel had these DVDs of her and dad.
did she ever show them to you?
a couple. You?
there was one that was really interesting.
it was, um... just before dad died.
it was his last session with her.
did dad kill himself?
Yeah.
a few years back, Matthews told me the truth.
Harry OD'd on his heart medication.
was it because of you?
he thought he had created a monster.
I think I know how he felt... why he killed himself.
but he only got it half right.
it's no accident that Zach Hamilton is here.
he's drawn to blood, like me.
and the arterial spurting here indicates that the killer severed the carotid artery with the first stab.
I'm promoting Miller to Sergeant.
are you fucking kidding me?
you actually made me want this, and now you're gonna take it away.
I just did a little research on you.
you checked into me... like a criminal.
Hey, Niki...
Dexter, this is Oliver. Oliver, Dexter. - Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.
he deserves to die.
isn't that a little intolerant coming from you?
what if you were to teach Zach the code?
maybe it's time to see if the experiment will work.
what possibly makes you think Zach could be taught the code?
I see something in him.
why were you going to kill your father?
because he's killing my mother.
she's drinking herself to death because of him.
you killed because you want to kill.
you should just go ahead and kill me.
Why?
cause if you don't, then I will do it again.
I can't help it.
am I ready to be a spiritual father?
Hey, are you okay?
I don't feel so good. - Deb?
Hello, Dexter.
remember me?
dress Code
Hello?
I was just about to leave you another message.
where have you been all morning?
the last thing I remember is... Hannah.
is everything all right?
not if Hannah got to Deb.
I can't really talk now.
I just thought you should know that Zach Hamilton called.
I'm so glad you decided not to kill him, Dexter.
I have to go.
Deb, are you okay?
Dex, where the fuck are you?
just a sec.
I'm outside of Kendall. Are you alone?
why wouldn't I be?
why are you on the other side of town?
I need you to come pick me up.
are you okay to drive?
I think so. I mean, who the fuck knows?
I woke up on the floor feeling like shit.
you were gone.
what the... What the fuck is happening?
just come pick me up.
I'll text you the location.
we'll talk when you get here.
Hannah drugged us, left me stranded in the middle of nowhere.
if she's come back because she wants one or both of us dead, then why are we both still here?
it was Hannah, wasn't it?
it was.
I saw her before I blacked out, but then I woke up here.
she must have drugged our food.
if Hannah poisoned us, why didn't she kill us?
who the fuck knows, Dexter?
maybe we were supposed to eat more.
or maybe she just wants to let us know she's out there.
maybe this was just the beginning.
if we were normal people, Dexter, we would go to the U. S. Marshal Service.
we can't do that. She knows everything about me.
Yeah, but she didn't talk about you the last time she was arrested.
because she was in love with me.
drugging me and leaving me on the side of the road might suggest that's changed.
so what the fuck are we supposed to do?
there are traffic surveillance cameras.
she had to have passed them.
I'll put in a request for the footage, get a license plate.
I thought this part of my life was over.
so did I.
the moment I asked you to kill her was the moment that I started to lose myself, and I'm just starting to get back.
I don't want to deal with this.
I want her gone.
Deb, I'll take care of this. I promise.
Hannah... just thinking about her throws me off course.
I have to put in a request for the traffic footage.
Zach, what are you doing here?
you were supposed to meet me at 10: 00 this morning.
I've been waiting all day.
you could have been followed. - By who?
Oh, Detective Quinn? No, he's pretty easy to lose.
but one day, he'll be there when you don't expect him.
don't ever come to my home again.
I just wanted to talk to you... - Ever.
we can't be seen in public together.
do you understand? That's your first lesson.
okay. Jesus. I'm... I'm sorry.
it's just... I-I spoke to Dr. Vogel, and she...
what exactly did she tell you?
that you have this, like, way of living that...a-allows you to do what... what you and I have in common, and... and that might be something that I can do too.
I mean, fuck, I have so many questions.
and I'll answer them as best I can.
are you gonna help me be like you?
don't even pretend.
Hi, Dexter.
going for a little night swim.
enjoy.
who's she?
that's my neighbor. - She's cute.
Yes, she's cute.
you need to go home.
when are we gonna talk about... - I'll call you.
look, something has come up that I have to deal with.
my day job, which is something you need to get.
Why? I have money.
you're a weird guy who lives with his mom.
you might as well be wearing a sign.
look, all I'm saying is that you need to have some kind of cover life, something that makes you look ordinary.
Yeah, right, yeah. I get it, yeah.
Zach, I understand what you're going through.
I will help you with this.
okay.
Thanks.
not a single sighting since she disappeared?
thank you.
motherfuck.
what you doing?
nothing.
why do you look like you just got caught?
come on, what are you doing back here?
you looking at porn over here or something?
no.
company computer. And I am the boss. - Will you...
Wayne Randall's girlfriend, right?
got arrested a while back for something, then somehow slipped away?
why you... why you looking her up?
none of your goddamn business. Will you fucking back off?
Jesus, relax. - No, I'm seri...
you come in here all the time and invade my personal space, standing so close, trying to flirt.
you're fucking making me uncomfortable.
I didn't come in here to flirt, okay?
I just came in here to see if you wanted me to pick you up something for lunch, that's it.
I'm all set.
are we done?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're done.
you know what? We're not done, actually.
see, Deb, you came to me six months ago, on an emotional wreck, saying you just quit the force and you needed a job.
I gave you that job.
I gave you good pay, good benefits.
I didn't ask a lot of questions.
I put up with a lot of weird shit from you because you're good at your job and because I'm a nice guy.
so I'm really, really sorry if this cramps your style, but next time, maybe you want to try a little gratitude instead of always being such a fucking bitch.
now we're done.
there she is.
Vista Marina car rentals.
Vista Marina car rentals. This is Stacy.
how may I help you?
Hi, Stacy.
this is Detective Cooper over at Miami Metro.
my badge number is 143634.
we're investigating a hit and run.
we think somebody who rented one of your vans might have been a witness, so I was hoping to get some information over the phone.
I can fax you over a copy of the warrant, if you'd like.
Oh, I'll just get it for you. Do you have the license plate?
Yes, I do.
it's, uh, GLV43951.
the name on that account is Maggie Castner.
the local address is Slip 23, Vista Marina.
thank you, Stacy.
want the phone number?
Yes, that would be helpful.
you may have found her.
if so, a little too easily.
you think she wants to be found?
I think she wants to destroy our lives, mine and Debra's both.
Debra's very fragile right now.
even the threat of Hannah coming after her could derail all the progress she's making.
I won't let that happen.
so what's your plan?
slip 23.
you have her number. You could call.
I don't want to let her know I've found her yet.
why do you seem less scared than excited?
because Hannah doesn't scare me.
maybe you need to rethink that.
they all look like nice apartments, but I think you should work things out with your brother.
angel and I are gonna be fine.
I've just had it with the whole "big brother ruling over the roost" routine.
and the thing is... - What?
well, just, most of these places, I have to sign a one-year lease, - and I wasn't sure about... - About what?
okay, I'm definitely not pushing you, okay?
I'm just trying to be practical here.
if our relationship keeps moving forward, we might want to eventually get a place together.
Yeah, eventually.
you don't have to decide now.
it's just something to think about.
Yeah, I'll totally think about it.
okay.
I'm so sorry.
I-I blew that whole thing out of proportion, I think.
I just felt like you were trying to, like, get rid of me with a check.
I was just trying to be a good, you know, father.
that was really sweet of you.
but it's my problem, and I want to take care of it.
well, I can respect that. So we're cool?
cool.
how about you and I do dinner tonight?
I can't.
I have to work right after class.
you know, pay off the debts.
wow, well, good for you.
where are you working?
it's a sports bar called lucky Pete's.
I can, uh, call you, though, when I'm free.
we can get together.
okay. Sounds great.
the Hannah McKay I know hated the ocean.
but it does make for an easy escape into international waters.
brave of her to be walking around Miami like that.
or maybe she's found someone to protect her.
may I help you? - I'm just meeting some friends.
I'm sorry, sir. Members only.
Oh, but I'm a friend of... - Even so, sir, we have a strict dress code.
call it a night, Dexter.
you don't want to go in there. - I do want to go in there.
it's their territory.
you'll be at a disadvantage.
I need to know what she's up to.
is your father a member at the Red Coral club?
Yeah.
it's full of old farts in suits. Why?
can you get me in there? Tonight?
Yeah. Sure.
good to see you, Mr. Hamilton.
so what are we doing here?
looking for someone.
I thought we weren't supposed to be seen together.
this is different.
you know her?
that's my ex-girlfriend.
nice. Who's the guy?
I'm gonna find out.
all right, you keep an eye on him.
you text me when he's coming back.
got it.
it's Maggie now.
you shouldn't be here, Dexter.
well, I'm not leaving until you tell me why you drugged me and left me on the side of the road.
well, after what you did to me, I'm not sure that you get to ask questions.
but here I am, asking.
what are you doing back in Miami?
well, I was about to enjoy a Martini.
you should probably leave, though, before my husband returns.
your husband?
you're married to that guy?
Yes. I'm very lucky.
Yeah, well, he seems rich.
you were always a pragmatist.
well, the money's nice, I have to admit, but... He has other talents.
miles is the adventurous type.
what are you doing here, Hannah?
my husband will be back any minute, and it's probably in your best interest that he not see us together.
well, I told you, I'm not leaving until you tell me why you did what you did to me.
I see you've made a friend.
this is my husband, Miles Castner.
Maggie has told me about you.
how you were her boyfriend, until you betrayed her, turning her in to the police.
quite a predicament you left her in.
shall we finish our drinks?
I think it's time for us to go.
well, that's an excellent idea.
make sure Mr. Morgan is given whatever he needs.
didn't you get my texts? I warned you that guy was coming.
I know.
so why didn't you walk away?
I mean, I watched him. I stayed on him.
I didn't fuck up in there. - I screwed up, not you.
you did exactly as I asked you to.
so what now?
nothing.
I'll call you. We'll talk tomorrow.
so that guy, are we... Are you gonna kill him?
I only kill people who deserve it.
miles Castner made his fortune in international casinos.
he has the power and the reach to get Hannah a new name, new passport, but if she's as happy as she seems in her new life, then why is she here, messing with mine?
miles Castner... What kind of name is Miles, anyway?
hello. Harrison, hello.
that's it?
I remember when I used to get a hug.
even I don't matter when Rastamouse is on.
I checked in with Marshals, FBI, fucking Homeland Security.
there hasn't been a single sighting of Hannah McKay.
I'm hoping you've had better luck.
Yeah. I found her.
she's married.
well, there's someone for everyone, I guess.
I hope he's sleeping with one eye open.
what's her married name?
the guy she's married to is worth $700 million.
he owns casinos.
the name, Dex.
they're staying on his yacht.
I don't know what they're doing in Miami.
maybe he has business here or something.
but he seems to know who she is, even knows about her and me.
and she... seems to like him, or maybe she just feels obligated to him.
I doubt Hannah McKay feels obligated to anyone.
it's got to be operational.
she needs a cover life.
it's not like it's a real marriage.
she can't actually love this guy.
Oh, my God.
you're still in love with her, aren't you?
what? No.
she's probably trying to kill me.
trust me, no one knows what it's like to fall in love with the wrong person more than I do.
but you better get your fucking head on straight.
she is everything that is wrong with our lives.
she is a vortex. She is a black hole.
she sucks everything into her being, leaving nothing behind.
we have got to get her out of our lives.
I'm working on a plan.
are you sure you can be objective?
one little toss of Hannah's pretty blonde hair, and you turn into a fucking moron.
Hannah is here?
both of you? Jesus. Really?
Deb, I'm on top of it.
I'm gonna figure out exactly what she's up to.
are you?
where is Hannah?
right now, she's on a very big boat with her husband.
Hey. Hey, what are you doing here?
I came here to see you.
I didn't realize this place was a breastaurant.
I mean, it is a sports bar. It's just topless.
and I make really good money here.
are you really okay doing this?
Yeah, it's not the best job in the world, but it's also not forever.
I'm fine with it.
I can tell that you're not.
me? Oh.
look, I go to places like this all the time.
see? - I... Look, I've stared at a million boobs.
but until now, I never considered them to be... daughter boobs.
daughter boobs?
well, come on. You know what I mean.
guy, hey. Her face is up here, okay? Come on.
it's so sweet that you care.
I'm just gonna stay here until something better comes along, okay?
Yeah, I'll, uh... I'll let you do your thing.
do you want to have dinner on my next free night?
Yeah.
that's great.
it actually makes sense, in a way, that Dexter would have been involved with another killer.
well, she's back.
and she poisoned us. Who knows what the fuck else she has planned?
what does Dexter say?
he's trying to figure out what else she's up to, but I'm afraid he's thinking with the wrong head right now.
you're concerned for your safety.
and for Dexter's.
let's take a step back.
from what you've told me, if she wanted to kill you, you'd be dead by now.
well, maybe she just wants to prove that she has control, that she can kill us whenever she wants to.
it's a very unsettling feeling, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
so what is it you'd like to do?
I would like to take her to Marshal Services and have her the fuck arrested.
but Hannah knows too much. - Yeah.
but at least I wouldn't have to worry about what might or might not be in my morning coffee.
when the brain surgeon was out there, a threat to me, I-I could hardly sleep.
I trusted Dexter to solve the problem, and he did.
and if I can't?
before you take matters into your own hands, be sure to consider all the consequences of those actions.
the husband is a complication I don't need.
I have to get Hannah alone, in a situation I control.
have you done the blood work on the triple in Lummus Park?
not yet.
there's the prints on the pesticide bottle still to run and the decomp over in Coconut Grove we still have to process.
Yep.
whew, we could use an extra set of hands, right?
someone lower level, an extra warm body to offset all the cold ones.
don't you think? I mean, at least to make a dent in the paperwork.
sure, I guess.
excellent idea.
Zach... What's he doing here?
okay.
my client requests that you cease and desist this 24-hour watch you have on him.
he requests it.
I'd like you to back the fuck off.
you took these photos, Zach?
Yeah, and those are just the best ones.
Quinn, do you have anything to say?
Yeah, I think the kid's guilty.
I'll answer for you, Detective Quinn.
on behalf of the entire department, I can assure you that we will... Well, how did you put it, Zach?
back the fuck down.
off. - Yeah, that too.
right, Detective Quinn?
right. - That's right.
gentlemen, let me show you out.
what the fuck were you thinking?
that rich asshole is walking around, free.
we have nothing on this kid.
that's why I was following him.
Yeah, if this was any other case, I would personally sign off on the overtime.
but this one... Let it go.
that's an order.
by the way, me and Jamie are moving in together.
you're what? You're doing what?
Hey, uh, you got a minute?
uh, make it fast.
okay, well, Dexter and I are buried in that glass box.
we need an assistant.
I don't know about that.
wait, hold on, we've been under budget the last three quarters.
it was Dexter's idea. - Okay.
part-time.
you're one hell of a lieutenant.
the photos were a nice touch.
Thanks. I thought so.
well, now he's off my tail.
we can get down to business.
find someone to... you know.
eventually.
what do you mean,"eventually"?
I mean... Long before my father taught me how to do what I do, he taught me how not to do it.
why would I want to not do it?
timing is everything.
one thing you need to learn... The first thing that I had to learn... is to wait.
control your urges.
channel them appropriately.
Dexter, I can't wait.
I can't control it.
Yes, you can.
you're gonna get your chance, Zach, I promise...
but the only way I've survived as long as I have is by being careful.
I'm gonna teach you how to do that.
and then?
and then you'll be able to do what I do and get away with it.
what do you want?
I saw you with your son.
Maggie never mentioned him.
hard to picture her as the family type.
there's nothing going on between Hannah and me.
good. Then listen.
I'd sooner see her in prison than lose her.
do you understand?
because I could call a few people and ruin your life.
and being a family man, I'm sure that's not what you'd want.
people are so impatient.
Dexter, what are you doing?
this is something you don't want to get in the middle of.
where are you?
he said he'd sooner see her in prison than lose her.
if that's what he thinks this is about, she's the one in danger.
I thought you were going to find out if Hannah was a threat to you and Debra, not if Miles was a threat to Hannah.
meet me in the greenhouse.
why can't I do both?
your flowers.
that's the thing about plants.
you don't look after 'em, they die.
so... what's up?
miles just met me at a gas station.
God. He likes to be dramatic.
is he a threat?
a "chop you up and toss you in the ocean" kind of threat?
no.
but he could make your life miserable, have people look into you and follow you around 24/7.
he sounds like a great guy.
and you're really in a position to judge?
why did you marry him?
because he was there when you weren't.
I needed him, Dexter.
I met him a few years ago when I did some flowers for him at an event, and he found my background intriguing.
I could tell that he had a bit of a crush on me, so when I made my little escape and when I had nothing and when I was desperate, I know that he could give me a whole new life, a new identity, money.
Plus, he makes me happy.
bullshit.
if you're so damn happy, what are you doing back here?
why did you drug Debra and me?
you know, I think you should go. - No, answer me.
I wanted to make sure that you weren't gonna put me in jail.
I had to see if you would come to me.
which I did, and you still haven't told me why.
because it doesn't matter why anymore.
I changed my mind.
about what?
I wanted you to kill Miles for me.
you what?
he's possessive and controlling and obsessed with me to the point where he follows me everywhere.
I might as well be in prison.
if I were to try and leave him, he would... he would just turn me in.
why haven't you dealt with this in your usual way?
because his family already thought that I was some kind of gold digger when we got married.
if he was gonna drop dead suddenly, for no reason, I would be the first person that they would turn to.
and once the cops get a good look at me...
you wanted me to make him disappear.
I thought you might feel like you owed me.
owed you? - You didn't have to turn me in.
you ruined my life. - I did...
you know, it doesn't even matter anymore, because like I said, I changed my mind.
and this is my problem, and I'm gonna find a way to deal with it.
why did you change your mind?
because the moment that I saw you there, unconscious, I realized that, despite the shitty way that it all ended, you were it for me, Dexter.
I've never felt that way about anyone before or since.
you're the only person that I can be that honest with.
and I didn't want to ruin that by manipulating you into doing something that might be bad for you.
it was the same for me.
no, just leave it at that.
I have to go before Miles finds out where I've gone.
Hannah... - Good-bye.
um, can I borrow that high-tech G. P.S. tracker thing that you have?
please?
Yeah. Being nice when you need something, huh? I'm not surprised.
sorry that I overreacted earlier.
I know that you're interested.
you act like you are.
but, Jake, you don't want to get involved with me.
you have no idea who I really am.
I just want a chance to find out.
can I help you? Is that your car?
um, it... it's my brother's car.
I think I left my sunglasses in the passenger seat, and he's not answering his phone.
your brother is... - Dexter Morgan. He lives in the building.
Oh. Oh, you're Dexter's sister.
I'm Cassie, his neighbor. - Debra.
Oh, fuck, you're Cassie who went out with him, right?
Really? He mentioned me?
you look surprised.
I am.
I, uh, I guess I figured he thought I was the worst date ever.
he didn't exactly follow up.
but he's always nice to me when I see him.
he's kind of impossible to read.
Yeah, that would be Dexter.
Oh, okay, good, I was starting to think it was me.
Nope, definitely not you.
Hey, um, since I've got you here, what's his deal?
jamie seems to think he's not over his ex-girlfriend, which totally makes him more attractive to me, 'cause apparently, I have a thing for unavailable men.
sorry. That was an overshare.
that's all right. I get it.
it's so crazy, right? I meet this totally nice guy who's completely into me, and I'm still hung up on the mysterious man next door who hasn't called.
I don't know you... At all, actually.
but you seem like a normal girl, you know?
if I were you, I would probably stick with the guy that's obviously interested.
trust me, Dexter is not a mystery that you want to solve.
okay.
Yeah. Sorry about all that.
it's all right. Have a good one.
see you.
you could've come inside. I just got your text.
Oh, well, you know, I think I've seen enough of that place, you know.
so... What brings you by?
I wanted to let you know that a lab assistant position just opened up at Miami Metro, and it's yours if you want it.
what does it pay?
$13. 75 an hour, plus dental.
I make a lot more money than that here.
you did say that this wasn't your first choice as a line of work.
Yeah.
I figured you'd jump at the chance for a future that didn't include pole dancing.
I'm not gonna be a stripper, Dad.
Hey, it just slipped out.
that's okay.
well, listen, just do me a favor. Just think about it, okay?
I think it would be good for the both of us.
okay. All right.
Bye. - Bye.
well, that's probably best for all involved.
two psychopaths together... Never a good mix.
Hannah's not a psychopath.
she has feelings.
I'll have to take your word for that.
anyway, I called you over here tonight because I'm concerned about Zach.
he came to me today in a very agitated state.
I know, I didn't let him kill his father, and now he's feeling the urge more than ever.
and how do you plan to handle it?
I was ten years old when Harry told me what my future would be.
I didn't kill until I was 19.
Zach can wait. He just doesn't know he can.
apples and oranges, Dexter. - Sorry?
you thought you had no choice but to wait because your father told you to.
but you were just a boy who'd never taken a human life.
Zach has already killed. - Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad you took him off your table.
but the moment you did, Zach became your responsibility.
he's relying on you, Dexter.
you need to take this very seriously.
Hi, you've reached Zach Hamilton.
please leave a message.
Hey, Zach. It's Dexter.
let's meet tomorrow afternoon, 2:00 p. m.
I'll come to your studio.
it's good that Hannah's leaving.
I have enough on my plate trying to turn a young killer into... Someone like me.
miles knows that Hannah and I saw each other yesterday.
if Miles will do this to me, what will he do to her?
so who are you tracking?
I'm just kidding, obviously.
I don't want to invade your privacy.
I just want to see if you need anything.
no, I'm good.
okay.
I know I can be kind of a dick sometimes.
you don't deserve that.
it's okay, most people think I'm a dick too, so I guess we're even.
this past year hasn't been my best.
the truth is, I wouldn't be surviving it if it weren't for you, so thank you.
you're welcome.
come on, what the fuck? Dexter!
it looks like he's not home.
can I give him a message?
Yeah. Fuck him.
Hey, babe.
good hunting?
Yeah, I found a couple dresses.
I think you'll really like them.
nice.
I'm guessing today's shopping went better than yesterday's.
about the same. - Really?
that's surprising, considering there probably isn't much of a selection at your old greenhouse.
what are you talking about?
you were with your friend.
well, he a... he asked to see me.
he wanted to make sure that I was all right after you confronted him, and I told him that everything was fine, that we were very happy together, end of story.
don't lie to me. I know the truth.
Oh, Miles, I told you, I don't care about him anymore.
so you won't be too upset then.
about what?
about what yesterday's excursion is going to cost your friend.
miles, that's unnecessary.
you've made it necessary. - No, please, don't hurt him.
"don't hurt him"? Why, because you love him?
no, I promise you.
I'm not ever gonna see him again.
he's the reason you insisted...
stop it. - On coming with me to Miami, returning to a place where...
Ouch! - You're a wanted criminal.
miles, ow!
he's the unfinished business you mentioned.
I want you to know I forgive you.
we're going to make a new beginning.
I've already told the crew we're leaving tonight.
we'll sail thehe coast, then cross the Atlantic, just the two of us, for the rest of our lives.
that's how much I care about you.
no, Miles. Stop it, please.
you'll never have to leave this boat.
stop...
I've given you everything! You belong to me.
no, stop it. Get off me!
I-I tried to run, but... He just grabbed me.
I didn't mean for it to happen this way.
are you hurt?
I'm okay.
we need bleach, bags, something to cut with... an axe or a saw or something like that.
you think you can get me those things without letting the crew know that anything's wrong?
Yeah, I think so. Yes.
wait, you need to change.
all right. - Hannah.
it's gonna be okay.
I'll take care of everything.
I believe you.
so that's how you make people disappear.
give or take a plastic room and a kill table, yeah.
Yeah, I remember that part.
do you ever wish that you had followed through?
with killing me?
no.
ever wish you had?
I was never going to kill you, Dexter.
it's just... well, I knew I couldn't live with Miles for much longer, and...unlike you, I don't actually enjoy any of this.
so what's next?
I told the crew that Miles was going to New York for a few days, so that should buy me some time.
what's wrong?
I have to go to a crime scene... At my apartment building.
what does that mean? - I don't know.
I have to go.
please don't leave town before we talk again.
I won't.
this could be my apartment.
what happened?
I don't know. I just got here.
Cassie and I, we were supposed to have a date tonight.
I'm sorry.
I know you were friends. You okay to work this?
Yeah. Yeah.
what do you see?
she was bludgeoned.
see those marks on her neck?
someone held her down and beat her to death.
God.
Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.
is it possible Zach did this when I was with Hannah?
Harry was a good teacher to me because he was normal, human.
but can anything good come from putting two killers together, whether it be student and teacher or whatever Hannah and I have?
or will it always end the same way, like this?
if I do happen to find her, you'll get your reward money.
Oh, shit. - Who's that?
federal marshal.
Dexter Morgan, what the hell are you doing here?
Arlene's a friend. We met through Hannah.
it's not safe for you to go back to the hotel.
you need something private. - What the fuck?
it's only for a couple of nights.
couple of nights? That's it.
sorry ，I'm not Deb.
she's always accusing me of comparing you to her.
welcome back to Homicide, detective.
I just need some time to think about it.
take all the time you need.
there's no life for me here in Florida.
I can have a life somewhere else far away from here in Argentina. Maybe we all can.
Yes. Me, you, and Harrison are gonna move to Argentina.
Zach's killer is related to you.
the brain surgeon is related to you.
I had two sons, Daniel and Richard.
my older son...Daniel... - He killed Richard.
then we put Daniel into a mental health institute.
that guy Cassie was dating... Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.
suppose you do find him, Dexter.
what are you going to do?
he's murdered four innocent people, and he killed Jack Hamilton.
he's my son.
he got away.
that's why I'm here, to warn you.
I think it best, from here on out, that I handle this myself.
Vogel is on her own, and so am I.
I'll kill Saxon and leave Miami forever.
so now do you believe me?
Yes.
goodbye Miami
feels good to cook for you again.
it reminds me of what it was like to be your mother.
you think fixing breakfast makes you my mother again?
no. - You gave up the privilege a long time ago.
Daniel, whatever mistakes I've made in the past,
I want to make it up to you.
I can help you.
help me how?
I can arrange for the care you need.
the care I need?
I will never be locked up again.
I have contacts at the best facilities.
like the last one you sent me to?
do you know what that was like?
day after day wondering when you'd finally come to visit, only to realize that the answer was never!
Daniel, I couldn't. You'd killed Richard.
that was your fault!
you ignored me.
all you ever cared about was Richard.
you never tried to help me.
I was young, inexperienced.
I didn't know how to help you.
but you sure as hell knew how to help Dexter Morgan.
you taught him how to deal with his condition.
you gave him everything you denied me.
while I was rotting away, you gave him a life.
I know that. I do.
it was a horrible mistake.
I was your son. I needed you.
please... - Please what?
let me help you.
I'm sorry for everything I've done.
I truly, truly am.
I wish I could believe you.
Hey, Harrison.
Oh, I missed you.
Hey, soon you'll be able to spend all the time you want with her, but right now, Hannah and I need to have a grown-up talk.
okay, bud? - Okay.
so... some potentially good news. - Yeah?
deputy marshal Clayton stopped by my place.
it seems like he's backing off on his search for you.
Oh, that's a huge relief.
even so, he managed to get your face all over the news.
you still need to lay low.
so how am I gonna get out of Miami?
well, no one's looking for a woman traveling with her husband and child.
I'm thinking the three of us could leave together.
I like the sound of that.
there's still so much to do.
I've gotta tell Batista I'm leaving...
get Harrison out of school, see Astor and Cody one last time.
I need to list my condo, sell my boat, my car.
Deb can help out with all that stuff.
we're really gonna do it.
Yeah. We're moving to Argentina.
God, that was always such a fantasy I never thought that it would actually happen.
otherwise I would have learned Spanish.
we'll learn together.
we'll be leaving soon.
I have to kill Saxon first.
Oh, so you are gonna go through with it.
I have to.
Vogel's not thinking clearly.
she doesn't seem to realize she's in danger.
I feel like I need to protect her.
you feel like you need to?
Yeah.
what? - It's just... when it comes to you and killing, feelings never enter the equation.
she needs me to protect her.
Hey! Stay off aunt Deb's treadmill.
but it's fun.
no, it's not for kids.
Hey, come here. I want to hear all about what you've been doing for the last eight months.
okay.
Hi, Aunt Deb. - Hi.
come on. - Can we talk?
what the hell is Harrison doing with Hannah?
deputy marshal pulled off the detail.
it's not safe for Harrison to be at the apartment as long as Saxon's still out there.
okay, then I'll watch him, but he shouldn't be with her.
that's not fucking fair to him.
Deb, I have to tell you something.
what?
Harrison and I are leaving soon.
what do you mean you're leaving?
you're leaving where? - Leaving Miami... with Hannah.
what are you talking about?
we're moving to Argentina.
are you kidding?
you know how stupid that sounds? - Deb...
you're gonna take your fucking son, move to another country with a wanted fugitive?
have you fucking thought this through?
Deb, I have.
we want to have a life together.
I wish there was a different way, but there's not.
we need to leave the country, start someplace new.
you act like this doesn't even affect me.
I know it does.
well, then, that's a really selfish decision on your part.
we'll still see each other.
I'll...come up here, and you can visit.
okay, I'll look you up the next time I'm in Argentina.
Deb, I'm sorry.
this is hard for me too.
Hey. How was your day? - Long.
well, I had a really good day.
not only am I about to graduate, but I got a recruitment letter from Greenwood Academy.
a therapist position. - What's Greenwood Academy?
it's a very well respected special-needs school in Atlanta.
they want to set up an interview.
that's fucking great. When you going?
I'm not.
what do you mean? Why not?
Joey, I'm not moving to Atlanta when you're here.
I'll find something in Miami.
I'm just so flattered that they're interested.
Jamie, I-I would feel like shit if I was the cause of you missing out on a great opportunity.
you shouldn't. This is my decision.
all I'm saying is, you know, you should do what's best for your career.
what about us?
don't worry about us, you know?
We'll...make it work.
be right back. I'm gonna go grab a drink.
please.
everything okay?
Yes, fine.
a little over-worked, so...
thanks for coming in this morning.
as I said, it's kind of a sensitive matter.
it's about one of your patients.
as I'm sure you're aware, he's gone missing.
Yes. I was hoping he'd turned up by now.
he hasn't. And I promised his parents that I would look into it personally.
but I'm afraid I've hit a dead end.
Tom, you know that I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.
come on, Evelyn, I'm trying to help this kid.
now, he lived at home.
how was his relationship with his parents?
like anyone his age.
did he say anything about trying to get away?
he talk about any friends, maybe a special girl?
was he into drugs? Gambling?
was he suicidal? - I don't know.
look, I know you understand better than anyone what it's like to lose a child.
not knowing is even worse.
imagine how the Hamiltons must feel.
I wish I could help, but I just don't know anymore.
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment.
Saxon killed his brother when he was only 14.
killed seven more in the fire when he was 17.
how many more since then?
he's lived in a dozen cities across two continents.
never been arrested. Never leaves a trace.
is he the perfect psychopath I once was?
Dr. Vogel. - Dexter.
can we talk?
what are you doing here?
Tom wanted to question me about Zach.
well, of course, I couldn't tell him anything.
but I feel horrid keeping Zach's death from the Hamiltons.
and we both know that Zach's killer is still out there.
understand, Evelyn, you are in danger.
well, you don't have to worry.
my son isn't gonna harm me.
how do you know that? - I just do.
have you been in contact with him?
I saw him.
when?
we had breakfast yesterday.
where is he now?
I have no idea.
Evelyn... - It's the truth.
he...he was angry and he stormed out of the house.
I don't know whether I'll ever see him again.
why didn't you tell me?
because you want to kill him.
and I don't want that to happen.
I can't turn my back on him again.
what is there you can do for him?
well... first, I can establish trust.
I wasn't a good mother to him when he was a child.
I need to win him over.
and then... well, eventually, hopefully...
I'll get him back into a facility.
and how many more innocent people will he kill before you do that, before he kills you?
if you won't protect yourself, I need to do it.
I don't want you to protect me, Dexter.
I don't want you to be a hero.
Evelyn, I have to... - Please!
don't use me as an excuse for killing Daniel.
she doesn't want my help.
so do I just walk away from this?
we could leave for Argentina tonight.
I don't even know how to find him.
you always find a way.
if you don't kill Saxon, her life is at risk.
crime scene.
you can send it back, you know.
it's not the salad.
so you asked me here to watch me eat?
you can't tell anybody this, okay?
Dexter is leaving Miami.
Why? He's quitting?
he and Harrison are gonna take the rest of the year and travel.
fucking. Good for him...or not.
I don't know if he's ever coming back, you know.
I mean, I get wanting a change, but...
sometimes, you know, when things don't feel right, changing it up is better for everyone involved.
not better for me.
he's my brother. I don't want him to leave.
I understand, but maybe you should think about what's best for him.
look, when I left New York, it was one toughest things I ever did, leaving my friends and family.
but as it turns out, finally being on my own was the best thing I ever did for myself.
Batista gave me my badge back.
fucking, that's great or not.
it's good. It's good.
I've wanted to come back for a long time.
you tell Elway?
not yet.
you know what this means, right?
you and me, side by side.
just like old times.
Seriously?
it's a crime scene. Gotta go.
no, I got it, I got it.
okay. Next one's on me...partner.
nothing will change after I'm gone.
blood will continue to pool, I just won't be here to photograph it.
the guy was hit pretty hard.
major head wounds, lots of broken bones, internal injuries.
road rage.
the guy on the bike wouldn't get out of the way, gave him the finger, so the driver ran him over.
lieutenant, can I get a word?
sure.
Hey, Dex.
I didn't know I had to work today.
why would you think that?
because it's Saturday.
are you high?
you're high, aren't you? I can smell it on you.
go home.
dad... - We'll talk about this later.
go! And stop smoking pot.
you have every right to tell me what to do at work, but you have no right to tell me what to do at home.
well, that's... that's... that's a huge shock, Dexter.
I know it seems like it's out of the blue, but after Rita's death...
and with the job, I've just had enough death in my life for a while.
I need a break, so... this is my notice.
you need this, don't you?
I wish you nothing but the best.
thank you. I'd like to keep this between us.
I'd like to let other people know myself, Jamie included.
she's gonna take it hard.
you know, she really loves Harrison.
he loves her too.
anyway, she's moving on herself.
new job soon.
maybe this'll make it easier.
I'll miss you, bro.
Hey, listen, if you change your mind, you always have a home here.
got it.
he said,"I'm too big for a nap," and then he went right to sleep.
cute.
so are you any closer in your search for Saxon?
not really.
I don't know much about him.
he moves around a lot.
I guess he figures if you stay in one place too long...
eventually you get caught.
I wish we could just leave.
Yeah, me too, but I know that you have to protect Dr. Vogel.
actually, she doesn't want me to.
then why are you doing this?
because it's what I do.
it's... who I am. It's all I know.
Dexter, you're more than that.
am I?
you think that when we move to Argentina that...
it's possible for you and me to have a fresh start?
Yes.
well, then, the sooner you kill Saxon, the sooner we can get there.
Vogel is the key. I'm sure he'll go for her.
but I can't just sit and watch her.
especially if she figures out that you're watching her.
that can make things worse.
I need to find him, but maybe I don't need Vogel.
just her computer.
I want you to see something. Get in.
I'm not gonna hurt you... Mom.
trust me, if I wanted you dead, I wouldn't be holding this door.
do you recognize this from the video I sent you?
this is where you kill your victims.
why did you bring me here?
to help you understand.
have a seat.
don't worry, I wiped it down after every, uh...
this room is more than what you think it is.
it's a reminder.
of what?
of where you sent me.
I've made it look exactly like what they called our "treatment" room.
when I would refuse to take my meds, the doctors would strap me down into a chair like this...
and they would force the meds down.
and that was usually the highlight of my day.
you can see why I caused that fire.
I can see why you'd do anything to get out of a place like this.
you said before that you wanted to help me.
Yes.
I'd like that.
most facilities aren't like this, Daniel.
I could put you someplace where you'd be very comfortable...
I could see you every day.
I want you to help me like you helped Dexter.
I want you to show me how to exist free in the world just the way I am.
Yes, I can.
Daniel, I can't help you to murder innocent people.
if you care about me, the way you say you do, you'll figure out a way to make this work.
I wanna be someone you can love.
I'm asking you as your son... please help me.
all right, I'll find a way.
what about Dexter? He's still after me.
I'll talk to Dexter.
don't make the same mistake you made with Richard.
choose right this time.
choose me.
I'll get Dexter to understand.
do you think that's possible?
I'll make it possible.
I want this, Daniel.
I want to be your mother again.
I'll do whatever it takes.
Vogel told me where she keeps a spare key in case of an emergency.
I think protecting her from her deranged son qualifies.
Saxon installed spyware on her computer.
thing is, that can go both ways.
so if Saxon can see Vogel's computer...
then I can see Saxon's.
so what are you looking for?
something, anything that can give me an edge.
what's this?
that's the video he sent to Vogel.
and this one's from last week.
no, don't! - Zach.
no, no! What are you doing? No!
Dexter, if something happens to Evelyn, it will haunt you forever.
you can't just run off to Argentina and escape who you are.
I'm not trying to escape anything.
so you'll post a job listing next week?
great. Listen, I just don't need any forensic tech.
I need the best out there. He's filling some big shoes.
I appreciate it.
sorry, deputy. How can I help you?
just came by to let you know none of our leads on Hannah McKay panned out.
you know, when the trail goes cold at this point, the subject either was never here, or skipped town pretty fast.
what does that mean?
it means the case is back to low priority.
all right. Thanks for the heads up.
I couldn't help overhearing.
you said you're looking for a new forensic tech.
you know someone? - No, I'm just curious...
who's leaving? It's not Dexter Morgan, is it?
close the door.
he hasn't told any of his friends yet, so this is on the quiet, but yes, Dexter's moving on.
Oh, he got a better job, huh?
no, he's going to travel, spend time with his son.
Really? - Yeah. I can't say I blame him.
Hey, babe. How was your day?
okay. You working?
Yeah, I'm just sending out resumes.
I'm almost done though.
Hey, um... can we talk for a sec?
okay.
I feel like an asshole, but I gotta be honest with you.
okay, so... be honest.
it's not working out between us, is it?
is that a question? - No.
it's... I'm sorry.
then why did you let me move in here?
I mean, why wait until now, Joey?
I hoped it would make things better.
I don't know what else to say.
Ugh, I am so stupid to think you would ever get over Deb.
it's got nothing to do with Deb.
I thought you wanted to be honest with me.
I am. This is on me.
she's got nothing to do with it.
Joey, see, that is what hurts the most.
you just keep lying about it.
I'm not lying, Jamie.
okay, you know what? Don't worry.
I'm gonna move my stuff outta here as soon as I can, so you're free to not go back to Deb.
Jamie... - Bye.
I don't want to intrude. - Well, it's your house.
it's your family.
it's your family too.
I want you and Harrison to be happy.
So...how do you feel about us leaving?
scared.
my whole family's moving.
scared?
you've always been there.
I don't know what my life looks like without you.
well, maybe it looks better.
Really?
hanging out with two serial killers... does it get better than that?
so you see my point.
I don't know.
better or worse... you've always been there.
moving on without you feels like jumping off a cliff.
I know what you mean.
what?
will you?
Hey, look who's here.
Hi. Just checking in. - All is well here.
Harrison's playing outside with Deb.
Oh, good. - You doing okay?
Yeah, I just wanted to hear your voice.
I have to go.
I was hoping we could talk.
okay.
I've been rethinking what I said earlier, and I fear I was being too judgmental.
I think it's possible that you and Hannah could have a relationship.
Really?
and I think moving far away, beginning anew might be the best thing for you.
moving far away? Is that the important part?
you mentioned Argentina? That could be a good place.
why do you want me to leave?
Dexter, I think there's hope for Daniel.
I don't think he likes killing.
I could help him, but I'm not going to get that chance if you kill him.
so just leave, please. Leave Miami.
you don't think he likes killing?
he says he wants my help.
let me show you how much he doesn't like killing.
no, don't...aah!
no...
that's Zach's head he's sawing into.
there's no hope for him, Evelyn.
this is the same person who killed your younger son.
he will never change.
I'm sorry.
so what now?
you know what needs to happen.
otherwise, he'll go on killing.
where is he now?
he said he would call me tonight.
set up a meeting with him tonight.
someplace public...safe.
call me and let me know where.
I'll follow him and take it from there.
just please don't let him suffer.
I won't.
do I know you?
deputy U. S. Marshal Max Clayton.
and this is Harrison.
Hey, buddy. - Hi.
you guys have met? Over at his dad's, yeah.
Harrison, why don't you go inside.
I'll be there in a minute. - Okay.
Elway gave me your address.
I thought it better we talk in person.
okay.
look, I'm worried about your brother.
Dexter? Why?
it's probably nothing, but it just struck me as odd that he's leaving town at the exact time Hannah McKay is rumored to be here.
how do you know he's leaving?
uh, overheard at the station.
maybe it's nothing, but... are he and Arlene Shram a couple?
I don't know. I don't keep up with his dating life.
okay, it's just I know he used to have a relationship with Hannah McKay.
what if he still does?
then he's a fuckin' idiot. - That's what I'm afraid of.
I know I'm going out on a limb here, but what if these two somehow reconnected?
I mean, his life could be at risk.
his son's too. - Dexter wouldn't do that.
I hope not.
I don't need to tell you what a dangerous person Hannah McKay is.
you know more about her than I do.
if Dexter were dating Hannah McKay, I would fuckin' know about it.
maybe he'd keep it from you. Who knows?
I mean, men do stupid things for beautiful women.
logic just flies out the window.
well, I appreciate your concern, but that's not what's happening here.
Dexter's burned out, that's why he's leaving.
okay. Thank you.
I respect your opinion. Here's my card.
call me if you think of anything.
okay, will do.
Hey. You guys hungry?
Yeah! - Hey, go clean up, Harrison.
is everything okay?
not really.
something happen?
deputy Marshal Clayton happened.
he was just questioning me on the beach.
I thought that Dexter said that Clayton was backing off.
somehow he found out that Dexter's leaving, and it tweaked him.
he thinks Dexter's helping you hide.
Oh, God.
I covered for both of you, but you have got to stay hidden until you leave.
of course. Yes.
Oh... thank you for protecting me... again.
who knew I'd be so good at it?
we'll all be out of here soon.
I know.
I-I have lunch. - No, thanks.
I have someplace I need to be.
can we talk? - Nothing to talk about.
I know why you're here. I'll have your last check drawn.
I was gonna give you two weeks.
don't want your two weeks.
I still have friends in Miami Metro, they said you were going back.
well, shouldn't we talk about this?
I went out of my way to make this work.
I put up with your bullshit.
the more I gave, the more you pushed back.
it's quite clear to me you were never gonna work out.
well, I'm sorry.
I really appreciate the job... and everything that you've done for me.
don't mention it.
Let...let's just, uh...
okay.
I'm gonna go pack up my office.
I'll have security do that.
they'll deliver it to your house.
and all the case files are mine, of course.
including those on Hannah McKay.
good luck to you. - Yeah, you too.
Harrison, remember what your dad said.
that's not a toy.
but Aunt Deb does it all the time.
Harrison, please listen.
I am.
honey, it's gonna be okay.
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts. It's gonna be okay.
here, hold that.
Dexter, call me.
we're gonna have to take you somewhere and get you patched up.
what happened? - He fell and hit his chin.
it's a pretty deep cut. It won't stop bleeding.
I'll let the doctor know. Are you the mother?
are you the mother? - Uh, yes.
I'm just waiting for his father to call me back.
fill this out. - Okay.
and wait for us to call his name.
okay. Thank you.
Harrison, you're being so brave.
I can't wait to tell your dad.
uh, yeah.
here.
been a while since we've been here.
choir director. - Long time ago.
Saxon's first victim.
and his last victims.
it's also been a while since you've used victims' pictures.
he needs to see what he's done.
that was always very important to you.
people get what they deserve.
at least they should.
I've come a long way.
it feels like I'm a different person from the last time I was in third room.
you're still you, Dexter.
I hope you realize that.
why wouldn't I?
I just don't want you to have any unrealistic expectations about whatever happens next.
I know exactly what happens next.
I kill Saxon.
and then Hannah and Harrison and I get on a plane and start our new lives.
Hey, Jamie. - Go fuck yourself.
what? - Debra, come on in.
I'm ready to come back if you'll have me.
if I'll have you?
are you sure about this?
you're not fooling me?
uh, I don't think so.
well, in that case, hallelujah.
can you start today?
I was thinking more like a week or two.
of course. Loose ends.
Yeah, something like that.
whenever you're ready, I'm ready.
it's funny, though. - What?
you coming back as Dexter's leaving.
he told you? - Yeah.
and don't worry about Jamie.
what was that? - Oh, you don't know?
Quinn just ended things with her...stupid idiot.
he did? - And so, you know, Jamie kind of blames you.
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah, she thinks Quinn is still in love with you or something like that.
I didn't want to know the details.
I'll let you have at him first.
we need to talk.
I just did what... - Not here.
did you break up with her because of me?
no. Yes.
I mean, no and yes. Don't get all mad.
your face gets all red when you get mad.
no, it doesn't. What the fuck happened?
it's not complicated. I wasn't happy.
I mean, I was okay, but I kinda knew I was never gonna marry her.
probably would have ended it soon anyway, even if what happened between you and I didn't happen.
nothing happened. We shared a kiss.
that's not a reason to fuckin' break up with somebody.
you're not hearing me. I probably would have broke up with Jamie, but what happened between you and I just made it clear that I shouldn't be with her anymore.
got it? - Yes.
so yeah, to be completely honest, I still have feelings for you, but I don't expect anything from you.
why not? - I didn't think you wanted...
I still have feelings for you, stupid.
I didn't change, I just... I wasn't sure that I saw a future for us.
what about now?
I don't know. I mean, I used to...
I used to feel like something was holding me back, but now...
now I just...
are you sure it was Hannah McKay you saw earlier today?
Yeah. I'd seen her picture on the news.
she brought in her son. He had a cut on his chin.
Hannah McKay doesn't have any children.
are you sure this is her? - Well, I think so.
what was her boy's name?
his name was Harrison Morgan, and she sure acted like he was her own.
I fell on my chin.
Yeah, how many stitches are holding that chin together?
six. - I bet that hurt.
Yeah, but Harrison was very brave.
I even got a lollipop. Can I go play now?
Yeah, sure.
thanks for taking care of him.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I feel awful.
I can't believe I wasn't here for you.
you went out in public.
you put yourself in jeopardy because I was setting up the kill room.
Dex, you didn't know. - It doesn't matter.
I'm trying to save Dr. Vogel when I should be taking care of you and Harrison.
we're okay, really. It's fine.
but there is one other thing. - What?
that deputy marshal came by. - Here?
he talked to Deb. I think she put him off, but still, we can't stay here for much longer.
I know.
Dexter, he's here.
here? Where's here?
at my house. He called me.
said he was a couple of blocks away.
no, that wasn't the plan.
you were supposed to meet him someplace in public.
someplace safe.
it's the last time I'm ever going to see him.
I wanted a private good-bye.
it's not a good idea.
that's him now. - Evelyn?
what?
I have to go.
well, be careful. - I will.
Dexter, go!
what if the marshal comes back?
he's not coming back.
it's Evelyn who needs you right now.
I should stay here with Hannah.
this is exactly what Vogel warned you about.
you're trying to live in two different worlds, and it's got you paralyzed.
I'm not paralyzed. I'm making a choice.
son, you're choosing to be afraid, because for the first time in your life, you think you've got something to lose.
is that who you want to be?
that's all right.
I'm getting old.
my aim isn't as good as it used to be.
why'd you want to see me tonight?
I just thought it would be nice for us to talk... about normal things.
unlike the other couple of times.
of course.
what's wrong? - Wrong?
you seem tense. - No.
no, not at all. I'm very comfortable.
maybe a little tired... under the circumstances.
is there something you want to tell me?
I just wanted to see you.
guess I'm sounding like a mother already constantly wanting her son around.
you know... when you see as many people die as I have, you know when they're afraid.
what are you afraid of, mother?
he's still here.
Hello, Dexter. - What do you want? Where...
don't move. I want to show you something.
don't touch her.
mother chose the wrong son, again.
Oh, no, no, no.
no...
No!
I am sacrificing my life for the protection of my religion.
I am going to become a martyr.
don't mourn my death. Celebrate it.
because today my soul is going home. To my Allah.
don't mourn my death. Today is the day of celebration.
today is my marriage.
Zaid ! Zaid, wait! Zaid, wait! Wait!

I want a child. Just like you.
and I want a country for that child.
where people of my community are not subjected to atrocities.
can you give me such a country? Tell me, Zaid.
all the colours of loyalty have become dull.
the lovely dream has shattered.
the one whom my heart loved immensely.
why did I lose that beloved?
ever-changing moments deceive us.

Zaid had liquor! - What's happening? What's going on?
till now I used to think that I am afraid of only Allah.
but today. . today I am afraid of my loneliness and Sarah's memories.
who was Sarah? What did she want? I really don't know.
I have spent 2 years of my life with a stranger in one house.
sir, you were right.
a woman hides secret from her own self.
just once. . just once let me find the answer of my questions.
which moment. . what was that thing which separated her from me and pushed her towards death?
sir, how can a person tie RD X on his body and blow it into pieces.
how do they do it, sir?
obsession.
these Jehadis don't talk to anybody about their obsession.
they make it a part of their lives.
they think of only one thing.
how to lay down their lives for their religionand become a martyr and thus go to heaven.
countless people support them in this madness.
nowadays even educated people have participated in this madness.
such people whom we can't doubt easily.
doctors, engineers, housewives, professors.
besides this they believe that their body belongs only to them.
only they have a right over their body.
that's why they make their body their weapon.
and they become human bombs.
then what happened in your house and this city. . that is what happens.
she was very happy with me. She didn't have any problem.
officer, people don't show their true form.
their truth is the one which they hide.
you are what you hide.
my experience says that there is some incident in your wife's lifewhich you are not aware of.
now what is that? You have to find that out.
under political pressure we have suspended you.
but under this circumstance, there is no officer better than you to nab this Jehadi group.
look, buddy. We do this work for professional reasons.
but for you this work is for your community's pride.
fair means if possible. Foul means if necessary.
what! Nasik! Why are you going to Nasik?
Sarah's DVD had arrived from there. - So?
so. . I want to know what she was doing in Nasik after lying to me that she is going to Pune.
Zaid, this is too much !
if you went there, then what difference will that make?
difference? Why won't it make a difference?
those people on whose saying she committed suicide they too must be there.
I want to meet those people.
I want to ask why they targeted my wife!
I have to find out the whole truth !
otherwise I will go mad ! my head will blast off!
Zaid, you are not talking about or dinary gangsters or thieves!
they are terrorists!
and it's not yours but the police's job to find them out!
and the police. . - God damn it! I am the police!
I am the police!
were! You were a police officer!
but you are not now! You are not on duty, Zaid !
look. . please!
it will be better if you tell Raj Mehra about Sarah's DVD !
Nandini ! don't! You will get tired ! and I won't change my mind !
whatever Sarah did. . . . somehow even I am responsible for that.
I have committed some mistake.
she was saying something which I didn't hear!
she had given a signal which I didn't see.
there was a heartbeat in her heart which I didn't feel.
accusing her again and again won't ease the burden on my conscience.
she was my wife. It was my duty to protect her.
and. . I failed in my duty.
I will have to go there. I have to expose this secret.
I have worshipped my Allah a lot.
I want some fruits of my worship.
I want to find out who was that person for whom she lay down her life.
forsaking my love.
strangers found the time to throw stones on me.
and my kin didn't even call me.
can I ask why?
why are you quiet, Mr. Sayed?
you are equally responsible for Sarah's crime.
I can get you arrested right now.
you have lied. Everybody has lied to me.
what was my fault?
what grave crime did I commit for which you people have punished me so severely?
answer me!
why did you all keep me in the dark?
I didn't lie to you.
Yes! I did hide the truth !
but not for my own self. . for that poor woman whose truth you might not have been able to tolerate.
but now she is dead. Nothing is left. Except memories.
those memories. . which digs at this old body and soul.
it scratches it.
I had only one son. Parvez. Sarah's father.
with great difficulty I made Parvez a computer engineer.
so that he could help in the progress of this country.
one day the police took him in custody accusing him of terrorism.
come on ! - What are you people doing?
what are you people doing? - Come on !
what have I done? Tell me!
what do you people think of yourself! - Come quietly!
you people can't do this! Where are you people taking me?
they brutally thrashed him in the custody.
they thrashed him so much. .
tell me! '
that he died !
tell me! '
Hey! He is dead ! '
we were ruined ! they didn't even let us see his face!
and they disposed off his corpse in the night.
for many weeks Danish made rounds of the police station.
he pleaded with them. To hand over his father to him.
no sir, But they repeated only one thing that Parvez has escaped to Pakistan.
Zaid, he had not run away.
they killed him and buried him somewhere.
I sought many people's help. I wandered here and there.
but everybody turned their backs on us.
nobody believed us.
3 months after that incident，we met some officers who had arrived from Delhi.
this country has betrayed Muslims, sir!
at the time of the partition we were told that there won't be any caste difference.
for the government everybody is equal.
but the truth reveals something else.
nothing has changed in the past 60 years.
from bad we have become worst.
and there is no hope of any improvement.
we have nothing. And we won't get anything.
so. . I implore you to hand over my son's corpse.
I don't want anything else.
let me bathe him once and bury him.
let me read his death's summons and fulfil my duty.
then only he knows and my Allah knows!
sir, I request you. Hand over my son's corpse to me.
Mr. Sayed, have faith in us. We have come to give you justice.
but you will have to do one thing.
make an affidavit of what you said in front of us and give it to Mr. Abrahim by tomorrow morning.
we will investigate your case thoroughly.
you will surely get justice.
Thanks.
we had high hopes from them.
we thought that we will get justice.
come on, get up. it is time for your prayers.
but the next day. .
come on !
who are you people?
come on ! - Leave her!
come on !
let her cover herself in a veil ! - No need for that! I told you !
leave her! Leave her! - Come on !
look. . we didn't kill your son deliberately.
by mistake he died.
what to do? We beat people and they die.
now it happens at times.
now what all things we have to do to make people spill out the truth.
your son was weak. He couldn't endure even a few beatings.
look. . we are patriots. We protect the country.
and you will submit an affidavit against us.
you will go to Delhi.
you will complain to our superiors. This is wrong.
forget your affidavit which you are going to submit to the superiors.
we have written this statement. Sign on it.
and take your children home. Live and let us live peacefully.
I will surely sign on the affidavit, sir.
think about it.
think once more, Sayed Noor Baksh.
you might have to pay a heavy price for your obstinacy.
what will you do? You will arrest us too? Then do it.
do whatever you want, sir.
listen ! you handle him.
get up! Come on ! - Danish !
come here! Come on !
what savageness is this, sir! Now will you kill this child too!
you !
you have still not seen my savageness! Move!
stop him!
remove your clothes!
remove your clothes!
no, sister! No, sister!
o Allah !
o Allah !
that day didn't end there.
I pleaded with them to forgive me.
I don't want justice from you people.
I don't want my son's corpse. But it was too late.
that day what they did with my granddaughter.
I tremble when I talk of it.
why are you hiding it? Move your hands!
move your hands!
will you lower your hands or shall I shoot your brother?
good !
uncle! Uncle!
look! What nice snap! Look!
now will you sign on my papers or shall I publish this in the newspapers?
no, no! No!
pen !
Yes! - Now can we go?
now can we go? - Yes.
but these snaps have made my intention bad.
do one thing. You go. I will escort her home.
No!
No!
after that incident. . Sarah was ill for many months.
doctors said to take her Away from Kashmir where that incident had occurred.
it might improve her condition.
so I brought her here.
then I met your uncle and we both decided to get you both married.
but why did she come here exactly 1 day prior the bomb blast?
she had sent me the DVD from here.
it's possible. But she didn't meet me.
and when I saw her photo in the newspaper, I thought she must have come here to meet Priest Umar Farhidi.
he too was here at that time.
priest Umar Farhidi. - Grandpa, who is he?
I have never met him.
but people say that whenever he talks about God and His teachings，
then children and old people, all get pulled towards him.
Sarah and Danish had started visiting him.
it's possible that Sarah did all this on his saying.
maybe.
but grandpa, where is Danish? - Maybe in Mumbai.
I have heard that Umar Farhidi too is there.
that's why I am worried.
bring him here at all cost, dear.
like Sarah he too might indulge in some madness.
I couldn't save Sarah, grandpa.
but I will surely bring Danish to you. I promise you.
have you seen him anywhere?
no. - No.
Thanks.
have you seen him anywhere? - No.
No!
aunt! Do you know him? - No, dear.
Thanks.
uncle, have you seen him? - No.
sure? - Yes.
okay.
after that she sat in a white ambassador car.
and that ambassador headed towards Mumbai.
who else were in that ambassador?
come on ! who else were in that ambassador?
these people are responsible for the bomb blast.
they are plotting to blast many other places.
come on ! tell me! Come on ! tell me!
here!
22, 23, 24, 25. Here. Go carefully.
there should be no mistake. Understood?
Danish, stop! - Leave him!
Danish, stop!
Danish, stop!
Danish, stop!
today, the tea is good.
why are you running away?
what happened to him?
greetings. - Greetings. Tell me.
sir, my younger brother just passed this way.
I am searching for him. - Nobody came here.
I saw him going this way.
Yes! You must have seen it. But we saw.
where did you see?
we all have to die someday.
whose voice is this?
this is Priest Umar Farhidi's voice.
I want to meet him.
look, sir! You are mistaken. Priest Farhidi doesn't live here.
this is his recorded voice.
we often play it in his absence to hear his teachings.
sir. . maybe you people don't know. I am a police officer. - So?
what will you do? You will arrest us?
so? It doesn't make any difference to us!
please come here for a moment.
look. . my wife was Sarah Khan.
I am sure you must have heard this name.
before dying she met your Priest Farhidi !
since many months she used to meet him many times.
look. . many people come here to meet Priest Farhidi.
he has no connection with your wife's death. Got it?
he has a connection, sir. And I will probe the depth of this matter.
move from my way!
look! This is a mosque. Not a wrestling ring.
please respect this sacred place.
and listen. . if you will stay here for long,
then you will be in danger.
got it?
you are threatening a police officer?
get lost! Come on !
you people will have to pay a heavy price for this!
I will meet your Priest Farhidi any how!
go away! - Leave!
go and inform him! - Leave!
goodbye!
you need to meet a psychiatrist, not a priest.
why do you want to meet him?
Nandini. . that man killed my wife.
that's night humiliation has killed your wife, Zaid.
if they had got justice. . then this wouldn't have happened.
many people don't get justice, Nandini.
so do they become human bombs and kill themselves. . . . and other innocent people?
I have to find this man !
so you think you will meet him and tell him don't commit these atrocities on us.
and he will quietly listen to you?
Nandini, I want to talk to that man face to face.
I want to see what is so unique about this man
that it converts poor people from humans to beasts in the name of religion.
Zaid, no! You can't do this! That's suicidal !
so be it! - What!
see you. - Bye.
catch him!
leave me! - Catch him!
leave me!
tie him! Cover him with the cloth !
cover him with the cloth !
tie his neck.
take this.
put him in the car!
hurry up. Come on. Hurry up.
put him in the car!
traitor! Being one of us you dare to go against us!
you slave for the enemies.
you scoundrel, even though she was a woman,
she sacrificed her life and set a example.
you ! you are not capable of being called a man !
just watch ! just how your death sets an example for this country and our caste.
roll.
make him sit!
greetings, this is A. C. P Zaid Ahmed Khan !
crime branch Mumbai police!
he serves the police department that commits atrocities on the people of our caste!
these are the people that kill and malign the people of our caste in the name of justice and freedom!
they cast lustful eyes on our sisters and daughters!
but now the time has come，
we will show them how justice is done!
justice as per our faith.
justice as per our religion.
which says that if a enemy comes in front of you in the battlefield, then behead him.
stop!
yes brother.
what?
alright.
release him.
priest Farhidi has called him.
the inspector has a good fate.
greetings.
even an enemy greets you back， Zaid Ahmed sir.
greetings.
come, take a seat.
the Muslims that are with the government,
after sometime their bond breaks with Allah and their religion.
isn't it?
strange, a person that is farthest from the devotees of Allah claims to be close to Allah.
I am sorry that my boys didn't behave well with you.
anyway, peacefully say what you want to.
peace.
you might know, that my wife Sarah Ahmed tied RDX to her body and blew herself to pieces.
one your indication.
not just that, she killed 20 innocent people along.
and you are talking about peace with me.
stay within your limits and talk to me.
you were eager to meet me and I fulfilled your wish.
Sarah never hid anything from me.
there was never any secret between us.
you killed her.
and who knows how many people you are sacrificing. . . . in the name of Jehad.
Why? I want to know why?
regretfully, your knowledge about Jehad is very less.
your wife was a martyr, we are indebted to her for her sacrifices.
but we are not responsible for her decision.
it is her will, it is the insult that she never forgot.
if she had any sorrow or pain, she could have told me.
but regretfully, she shared her sorrows with you and not me.
being my wife, it was her duty to tell me what she wanted to say.
you are comparing her sacrifice with duty. - No!
she was not a martyr, she was a criminal.
and you provoked her to commit this crime!
it hurts me so much, when I think that she blew up my happy life.
the feeling suffocates me, that she didn't even let me know this.
when she was choosing death, I was dreaming like fools to spend my entire life with her.
even a coward wouldn't be so helpless as much as I am feeling after her death.
priest Farhidi, I have heard that you talk so well,
that people get drawn towards you.
they get ready to die.
let me know, what story you do tell them.
what magic spell do you cast on them，
that they turn into cruel people from innocent ones？
that they don't even hesitate before killing people？
even those countries don't hesitate，
who shower bombs all over the world in order to eradicate terrorism.
they kill thousands and millions of people.
so sir, if they do it then that's protection. . . . and if we do it then that's terrorism.
you talk about sacrifice and Jehad.
you are using women and old men in the name of Jehad.
you are sacrificing many innocent people in order to take revenge of your insult.
because of the injustice of a chosen few，
you think the entire country is your enemy.
do you know, that because of your deeds,
the rest of the Muslims of India feel so ashamed?
we have to pay for your crimes.
our loyalty and patriotism is doubted.
Bravo, I am talking about the sorrows of our caste.
and you are talking about its shame.
Zaid sir, you must know how atrocities are being committed on the Muslims of our country.
the houses are being looted, children are becoming orphans.
neither can they study nor can they become capable.
they are locked up in jails as terrorists.
and for years their case never comes up.
like animals, they are killed either in an encounter or in the police custody.
and they don't even get justice, why?
we are Jehadi's sir, not terrorist.
the truth is that, when officers and soldiers like you,
kill people of their own caste for some money and post,
then people like me are born in every caste and religion.
but the strange thing is that, when atrocities are committed on people like us then it doesn't make much of a difference to your peace loving people.
they can be heard only when one of theirs fall prey to the atrocities.
please explain us sir, what kind of a country is this,
which is not ours after all.
what kind of a compatriots are they，
who can never listen to our cries.
what kind of an injustice is this which is dominant on justice?
A. C. P sir, this battle is about getting justice.
if you cannot even give us that, then why complain.
we are not the only terrorists, you are too.
if our hands are filled with blood,
then your hands are not clean either.
if you do injustice to us, then you will have to pay the price.
if we are safe, the country is safe.
we will not kill him, we will keep him alive.
so that he can see tomorrow.
I don't have to say anything else to him, good-bye.
good-bye.
take him along.
come, come.
come we will show you your brother-in-law's CD.
by tomorrow evening, this CD can be seen on every news channel of the world.
but we will show you in advance.
you can see this CD the entire night,
because you cannot go anywhere until tomorrow evening.
and that's possible only after our work is done.
come on.
greetings.
I know that the world will not understand what I will say.
that's why I will speak in the language that you understand.
I am responsible for the bomb blast at V. T station in the morning.
and I don't regret it.
I am not responsible for the calamity that has befallen on you it is you yourselves.
you never shared our problems.
this the punishment for your crimes. . which you repaid by taking your lives. . . . and by sacrificing my life.
this insult can only be erased by your blood.
until the people of our caste are insulted and slandered. .
till then you will keep becoming the victims of many more such bomb blasts.
we will continue doing it.
till the day, we can peacefully rest like you do.
kill the scoundrel.
move ahead and kill him.
Yes. - Sir, this is Zaid speaking sir.
what is the matter Zaid?
sir V. T station.
there is going to be another suicidal attack on V. T station.
I need your help.
okay Zaid, I will meet you there.
I don't think his condition is fine.
let him talk to priest Farheed.
Danish, we are proud of you.
only a few chosen people achieve martyrdom. - Yes.
any last wish?
my grandfather, he has no one except for me.
don't worry Allah is with him, he will take care of him.
break all your worldly relations,
and think about your deed.
can I talk to him for the last time?
the fear of death and the love for kin is the biggest obstruction in a martyrs path.
you have gone very far ahead. .
now there is no time left to look back. - Yes.
I am ready.
as soon as you press this button,
this device will get activated.
but you have to do that when crowd collects at the station.
there should be a lot of destruction.
look Danish, if someone suspects you,
then quickly press this button.
otherwise it is possible, that the enemy can shoot you from far.
this is a very important mission of ours.
that's why there shouldn't be any mistake in it.
did you understand young man?
sir you have been called in the surveillance room.
where is it? - There, on the top.
Zaid. - Sir.
nothing to worry, we are in complete control.
our commandoes are spread all over.
as soon as we get your indication, we will shoot the rascal.
but how will we recognise him, have you seen him?
yes sir, many a time. - Many a time, how?
sir, he is my sister's younger brother.
hold positions. Wait for my orders.
did you spot him?
hold positions.
what happened?
nothing, sir.
yes sir, no sir.
no, sir, we still didn't spot him.
one of our officers recognises him, sir.
as soon as he points out, we will take him out sir.
Yes, sir.
we will take him out.
Absolutely.
Yes, sir.
alright, sir.
where is Zaid? - He was right here.
are you calling your grandfather?
he will be very happy, he was waiting for your phone call, for a long time.
he has no one except for you.
your grandfather has grown very old.
he cannot even see properly.
he takes the support of a stick to walk,
because you are not with him.
I. . I had met him that day.
he was telling me the story about the injustice done to you.
I can understand, how lonely you must have felt.
you must have been so angry.
it must have hurt you so much.
she was your sister.
I was very angry too.
I was hurt too.
Freeze!
don't come close to me, I will kill you all !
no sir. Don't come closer.
Sir,let me talk to him, please for two minutes.
I will blow everyone up!
if he moves his fingers, kill him!
I'll kill you all.
don't wait for my orders.
sir, let me talk to him for two minutes!
let me talk to him please!
let me talk to him please!
let me talk to him please!
I will blow everyone up!
listen to me, now you are not alone, I am with you.
no one will do anything to you.
no one will say anything.
they will forgive you, they won't do anything.
take a look, take a look at these people.
they are our kin. This is our own country.
you cannot kill them.
they will get you justice.
we cannot lose hope my brother.
those who committed these atrocities on you,
I will get them punished.
come on, come with me.
we will go meet grandfather.
I cannot go to that old man with the pieces of your body.
we won't be able to shoulder your pyre.
I request to you, I beg of you.
listen to me, listen to me, brother.
an enemy said it, but it is true.
if their hands are filled with blood,
then our hands are not clean either!
we have given birth to terrorists!
first we create terrorists, and then we will kill them!
if humans snatch the rights of another humans,
and a protector of the law tries to harm him.
then surely, we open all the gates to destruction,
and calamity.
and then they walk on these paths,
because they don't have any other choice.
when intolerance becomes organised
or institutionalised, it destroys the democratic principle
and poses a threat to national peace!
the time has come when the protector of the law and this country, should look inside themselves.
because the biggest and most dangerous institution of hatred is the human heart and nothing else.
I would like to appeal to the government
to give compensation to the families whose members have been falsely killed
stating that they are terrorists.
strict actions should be taken against the police officers that kill innocent people in the custody and false encounters stating that they are terrorists.
and all the police officers should be suspended that help their fellow officers in this crime.
good shot, sir.
Mr. Yadav. Mr. Tyagi.
yes ?
I am Jai Balam from CBI. You are under arrest.
Yes, you are under arrest for the murder of Parvez Baksh.
grandfather.
we got justice grandfather.
the court gave all those officers life sentence.
I understood one thing, son.
if terrorists can take birth from cruelty,
then a messiah like you can be born too.
the battle that you have fought, that is the real Jehad.
come on, let us go home and pray.
that's why it is said, there is delay but not deny.
understood, Danish?
loneliness, ruthless loneliness.
it brought your memories along.
again and again, I remember those springs again.
the one that had brought happiness in my life.
lonely heart, it cried, the heart cried.
Bree's husband felt rejected.
I think it's strange to see my wife billed As "mrs. Van de kamp.
it's how I'm known.
is there a mr. Van de kamp?
no, uh, mr. Van de kamp is deceased.
would it have killed you to have mentioned me?
it's because I went to jail, isn't it?
Lynette's husband was excited.
we're gonna start a garage band!
I thought you were the one who said you wanted To spend more Time with your family.
guys need to blow off steam.
Edie's new husband had a past...
you've been here six weeks, And you don't seem any closer to coming to terms With your rage.
I've come to terms with it, And I like it just the way it is.
which remained a mystery.
I just think it's odd that you're married to some guy.
you don't know anything about him.
well, she kept asking me All this Stuff About your background.
and Susan tried to move on.
well, I sort of started seeing someone.
good for you.
every year, ms. Elenora butters Would ask her kindergarten class to draw a picture of their families
which she would then display on "meet the teacher" night.
that's how Ty Richmond's parents Saw his depiction of their fighting...
and Amy Hines' parents Saw her portrayal of their drinking.
and Jason Monte's parents Saw his illustration of their hygiene.
you see, ms. Butters felt it was important For parents to see themselves through their children's eyes.
she knew the experience...
ed, he's got me vacuuming in my bra.
do I do that?
could be very Educational.
I know, I know.
did I not say 7: 00? You missed their little show.
M. J.Was tooth decay.
well, crosstown traffic killed me.
and I told you to videotape it.
well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap?
next Time, be more specific.
Mr. Delfino, glad you made it.
uh, did you get to see m. J.'s artwork?
no, not yet. Can't wait.
Oh, hey, look at that.
there we are, Standing in front of the house.
look what he did with my hair. I kind of like the bangs.
Yeah, look, he put a wrench in my pocket.
and see how big my muscles are?
which is a good thing, 'cause there's a shark attacking the house.
Hey, daddy.
Hey, buddy. Your mommy and i Were just looking at your wonderful painting.
you like it?
I love it, especially how big and strong you made me look.
that's not you. That's Jackson.
see the paintbrush in his pocket?
Oh, who's Jackson?
he paints our house...
until my mom makes him drink wine and have a sleepover.
because... Mike and I are divorced, so that's why...
it was supposed to be a picture of the family, So you should've put your daddy in it.
I Did.
Oh, the... The bug with the little hat?
that's you, 'cause you're Always so far away.
Oh, yeah, that's, um...
now I see me.
yes... Every year, Ms. Elenora butters would ask her class to draw a picture of their families,
even though she knew the portraits might not be that flattering.
if you look closely into the faces of your friends, You'll see it.
Congratulations! - Come on in!
right behind their smiles, You will see a certain Green-eyed monster,
and then you'll understand How envious they are of your well-kept home...
your delious recipes...
and yourasteful ssessions.
here's my cookbook.
but you'll have to work hard to see the jealousy,
because good friends Always work hard To hide it.
look at you, right on the cover!
these are advanced copies.
I wanted you to be the first to have them.
Oh, and look, you signed it
to Lynette, The sweetest, most wonderful friend i've ever known.

I hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.

okay. - All right.
Oh, my god.
this is about m. J.'s drawing, isn't it?

he does not love Jackson more than you.
he knows who his father is.
I know that.
can't a guy get his kid a bike without being psychoanalyzed?
so you're totally fine with that drawing?
well, I won't go sticking it on my fridge anytime soon, But yeah.
look, I'm glad you're dating a nice guy.

Hey, guys.
Jackson, look at my new bike!

uh, that's a custom titanium frame.
make sure m. J. Nows that.
so, Wendy, I gotta know about the weather.
mommy, can Bethany go home now?
honey, she's only been here 20 minutes.
we invited her over to play, so go play.
but All she does is spin.
honey, we want Bethany to be our friend, So if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin.
why are you shoving that little weirdo down Juanita's throat?
that little weirdo is the key to you and I having more sex.
I know I should ask a few questions, but I'm in.
Bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate.
I'm trying to get Juanita an invitation.
how does that lead to quality Time with your boobs?
Carlos, the only Time you and I have to ourselves Is late at night,
but by that Time, we're too exhausted.
and now that we have Celia in afternoon preschool,
all we have to do is unload Juanita,
and then we can get back to doing the nasty.
this doesn't seem right.
I mean, dumping our kid off on some unsuspecting woman So that we can have sex?
wake up! Playdates were invented by mothers For this exact purpose.
shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon
playdates make All these things possible.
I- i don't know.
I feel bad making my kid playing with someone That she obviously doesn't like.
Bethany's mom will take Juanita once a week for two whole hours.
that is sex and a nap.
I don't hear you spinning!
I don't understand. You said the job was going so well.
it was.
then three weeks ago, My parole officer left me a message at work.
that's when they found out I lied on my application
when I said I didn't have a criminal record.
so you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?
I know you're angry.
honey... I'm not angry.
I'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.
I was embarrassed.
Bree, when we married, I was the breadwinner.
now you-- you have your company and you have your book.
I- i'm a felon who can't hold on to a job.
Orson, we're partners.
we share everything.
any success I have Is just as much yours as it is mine.
thank you, darling.
so... Why did the chamr of commerce call?
apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year.
is that good enough?
you'd be killer in our band.
I mean, wouldn't he be killer, Dave?
uh, Donald, why don't you let us talk it over And we'll get back to you?
no problem. I have to get back to the office anyway.
quarterly tax Time has got me swamped.
well, we'll-- we'll definitely call you today
Thanks, gentlemen.
don't you think he crushed it?
he was good... You know, technically.
he didn't really have heart.
what do you mean?
when he played "voodoo child," it was like Hendrix has risen.
Hey, what about Mike?
I thought that's who we were gonna get.
well, I asked, but he said he's too busy.
too busy to live a little? Not gonna fly.
call him. Give him my number. I'll talk to him.
okay, sure.
but-- but what about Donald I mean,'cause if we don't get Mike, I wanna make s
Tom, Donald's out, all right?
have Mike call me.
what a rehearsal. Dave and I were smokin'.
did you hear us? Lynette?
I'm sorry. What?
never mind.
what are you working on?
what, is this Bree's ad Stuff?
Oh, god, no. Her agency really whiffed...
so I'm coming up with a whole new campaign.
I was looking through my old portfolio For inspiration.
I remember this one. "feet? Meet your new best friends.
it was a classic.
you know, it been years since I looked through this Stuff. I'd forgotten I was...
kinda great.
you were awesome! I mean, come on.
how lucky is Bree To have a neighbor that used to be a big advertising hotshot?
well, Maybe I'm the lucky one.
this could be a perfect way for me To stick my toe back in the business.
nothing big, Maybe just pick up some freelance work.
but, honey, if you do that, where you gonna find the Time For the family and the restaurant?
well, gee, I don't know.
I gus the same place that you find Time for your garage band.
Lynette, I'm just saying that if-- if you...
okay, I dropped off Celia at preschool, And Juanita's at her playdate.
drop trou.
why don't you put on that sexy red Teddy?
can I ask why? I mean, you can't see it.
Yeah, but I can feel it, And I love the sensation of sliding silk off your body.
what's it like, Carlos?
what?
sex as a blind man.
I mean, you used to be so visual.
is it still as good?
Oh, it's better. I mean, having to rely on Your senses of touch and taste and smell...
it's actually way more intense.
Really? You're so lucky.
what, you want blind sex?
I think I can arrange that.
hey there.
looks like somebody's job interview went well.
Nope. They turned me down flat.
but as I was driving home, it suddenly hit me.
I May be persona non grata at every company in this town,
but there's at least one employer I know Who would love to hire me.
who?
you.
you wanna work here?
why not? I'm great with food.
I understand business. I can't beat the commute.
well, that's certainly an intriguing notion.
but wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?
Absolutely.
but as you said in the park, We share everything.
so I would be more of a... Partner.
Bree, would you give me a hand with this arrangement?
just give me a sec.
I think the lilies need their own vase.
if you hire him, I will cut you with these scissors!
I don't think we need to do that.
I think they're crowding the irises out.
just like he's trying to crowd me out.
you Already have a partner, remember?
Oh, well, I think the irises and the lilies Could work together.
Nope. One of them has to go.
if I May offer an opinion
not a good Time, Orson.
tell him now, Or I will walk.
Orson, you really don't wanna work with me.
I mean, you only see me at home.
but at work, when the pressure's on, I can be a bit of a handful.
Kathine's seen how I get.
he gets it, dear.
honey, you're my partner in life.
but if we want to keep it that way, We shouldn't mix marriage and business.
but no one else will hire me
well, you've only been looking for a few weeks.
I mean, give it another...
say, month or two, And you still haven't found anything,
then we'll revisit the idea. Okay?
okay. It was just a thought.
Oh, so what'd you think?
Oh, my god, you were right.
blind sex is incredible.
ahh, give me ten more minutes and an energy bar, And we can go one more Time.
no, I think we're done.
honey! What are you doing home? I thought you were at Bethany's.
I got a tummyache. Her mom brought me back.
well, how long have you been Standing there?
I don't know. What were you two doing?
um, we were, uh... - We were wrestling.
wrestling.
did daddy hurt you? You were making Loud noises.
No! No, that wasn't real.
sometimes I fake it when I wrestle with daddy.
please don't wrestle th mommy. You're too big.
you could hurt her.
Yeah, Carlos, stop that.
okay, go to your room, And I'm gonna bring you something for your tummy.
I think she bought it.
you mean the story of how daddy beats up mommy?
relax. I told her I was fine.
look, I could hear the worry in her voice.
why don't we just tell her the truth?
what, that sometimes mommy rides daddy Like a mechanical bull to get jewelry?
she's 5. She's too young to understand Either half of that.
it's the facts of life She's gonna learn 'em eventually,
and it's the most natural thing in the world.
Carlos, if she was Standing there Any longer than five minutes,
there was nothing natural about what she saw.
by the way, thank you for that.
Hello? - Hey, it's me.
listen, i've got some free Time, So I thought I'd come over
and teach m. J.How to ride his new bike.
great. He's so excited to learn.
are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?
Oh, he'll probably have to take a few spills,
but luckily, he'll have his old man there to pick him up.
Yeah. He's been asking when you're coming.
I can't wait to tell him.
I know he'll be just...
what's the Matter? - Spider. Big one.
gotta go!
mommy, look, no traing wheels.
I know! You did great!
Jackson, can I see you a sec?
that was amazing! He learned so fast.
Yeah. You know what I learned?
Mike is on his way over here To teach his son how to ride the bike he bought
something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.
w-why didn't you tell me that?
I didn't know I had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.
M. J.-- he just kept asking me. He-- he made me do it.
you could've walked away. - No, I couldn't!
he said, "pwease!
damn it.
as you can see, the graphic works just as well On a free-standing display unit.
neat, huh?
goodness, Lynette. When you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign,
I wasn't expecting anything quite so... Elaborate.
well, who knew your Marketing guys were such lame-os?
what they came up with is so... Tepid.
um, I think "understated" was what they were going for.
well, they overshot and wound up in "bland," Right on the border of "sucky.
you need to grab your audience, just grab 'em.
I've gone for jazzier colors, Bolder fonts.
Oh, I have really played up the whole nostalgia angle.
let mrs. Van de kamp Turn your oven into a Time machine.
I see women really responding to that.
do you?
because I see children Crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs.
okay. Well... I've got a whole bunch of Alternatives.
Oh, Lynette, I appreciate everything you've done.
but i've actually approved the old campaign, And I can't just tell them i've changed my mind.
you don't have to. I'll be the bad guy.
just tell 'em you've hired me, And i'll go in there, six-guns ablazing.
so... Do we have a deal? Just give me the word.
no. - No?
sorry, but I prefer their campaign.
but mine is better.
well, you're... Entitled to think so, but I don't.
look, Bree...
I think I know a little more about Marketing than you do.
when I was in it, I owned this town.
I had every big account.
hell, I was even named businesswoman of the year.
well, I'm familiar with that award.
in fact, I'm this year's recipient.
Really? - Yes.
there's a luncheon on the 12th. I do hope you can make it.
by the way, You're right about those colors.
very... Jazzy.
come on, m.J. Your daddy's waiting.
mommy, I don't wanna fall.
Oh, honey.
you know how you like to push the button When we go on the elevator,
and if somebody else pushes it first, It makes you sad?
but I don't wanna fall
just listen. Daddy really wanted to be the one To teach you to ride your bike,
and if you can Already do it, It's gonna make him sad.
so just let daddy push the button. Understand?
Oh, man.
wow, he's really picking it up fast.
Yeah. I think it's just beginner's luck.
are you sure he hasn't been practicing?
no. He was absolutely waiting for you. You know, I think I'm gonna go check his helmet.
what are you doing? We talked about this. You're supposed to be new at it.
I don't want to fall. I'm scared.
of what? You're 3 inches off the ground. You're completely padded.
so just do what I say-- Wobble, wobble.
daddy, look at me!" Crash.
boy... He was just telling me How glad he is to have his dad here.
Really? 'Cause I Almost feel like he doesn't even need me.
Oh, that's just silly.
Oh, it's a good thing your dad's here To teach you how to do it right.
Oh, looking good, buddy, but remember, When you stop, you gotta put your foot down first. Okay?
Oh, what, does that hurt right there, buddy?
Oh, he's fine.
no, mommy. It hurts.
this is All my fault.
Oh, will you stop? The doctor said it was just a sprain.
I know, but still, I shouldn't have pushed it.
you know, why look for blame? Kids fall.
if you have to find fault, Blame the pavement, not yourself... Or me.
mommy!
he should have his pitching arm back in no Time.
Oh, thank you. But I did wanna ask
M. J.Said that he fell on purpose,
something about you telling him To "let daddy push the elevator button"?
you told him to fall?
remember, it's the pavement you're mad at.
what the hell, Susan? Why would you do something like that?
Jason taught him to ride the bike.
who's Jackson?
he does sleepovers with mommy.
they drink lots of wine.
Hey, doc. Uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?
I'm sorry.
M. J.Was excited about the bike, So Jackson took off the training wheels And taught him.
he didn't know.
he didn't know I'd wanna be the one To teach my own kid how to ride a bike?
okay, you know what?
this is not Jackson's fault.
you can't give a 5-year-old a bike And expect him to wait to ride it until you have Time.
you know, this is what it means to be divorced.
it means that sometimes you won't be there.
I know. It's...
just harder Than I thought it would be.
well, it's hard for me, too.
I miss things when he's with you. And i...
am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because...
I have to.
so do you.
there's nothing else you can do.
has Mike called?
Hi, honey. You're home.
sorry, hon.
so did he call?
no. Hey, listen to this.
Mrs. Hudson's putting her house up for sale.
I think we should buy it.
Why?
as an investment. I-i mean, it's fantastic.
my friend Mary Alice blew her brains out in this house,
and All I'd have to do is let that slip, And we'd get it for a song.
Yeah. I don't think so.
well, why not? We'll rent it out. We could make some serious money.
last thing I wanna be is a landlord, Get a phone call every Time a toilet overflows.
that's why we hire a management company
damn it, Edie, I said no!
why are you yelling at me?
I don't know. I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Bethany. I'm here to pick up Juanita. Is she around?
boys have sperm.
excuse me?
we need to talk.
so apparently, after we had our little chat with Juanita,
she went straight to Bethany And passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail.
well, did you explain to Peggy why we had The little chat?
she didn't wanna hear it Not with Bethany running around the house,
screaming "intercourse!" at the top of her lungs.
so we're out of the playdate?
Oh, yeah. Way out.
well, I guess it's back to the old schedule Of ten minutes of grope 'n snore at midnight.
I'm not going back, Carlos. I can't.
if Juanita doesn't get her playdate, You're not getting yours.
fine. I will fix it.
I just don't know why Peggy's making such a big deal out of this.
sperm!
Juanita! Stop talking to your sister!
Orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
you were snoring too Loudly.
me? Snoring?
mm, like a donkey with a head cold.
honey, I don't snore.
Oh, you can't Always hear yourself.
but I hear you... Loud and clear.
Oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed.
no. I'm good here.
Dave Williams. Look, hate to bother you, But I got a busted pipe outside the house.
probably some kids playing a prank.
no problem. I'm across town finishing up on another job.
so depending on traffic, give me... Say an hour?
Oh, thanks. I really appreciate it
so when Juanita thought that I might be hurting her mother,
we decided it was best that she knew the truth.
it just seemed like the right thing to do at the Time.
see, honey? I- i knew there had to be a rational explanation.
well... I guess under the circumstances, You didn't have y other choice.
so... Do you think there's any chance Juanita could rejoin your playdate?
we've talked to her. She will never discuss sex ever again.
not if she wants to see her favorite dolly Alive.
Gaby, we don't need to let them know All of our parenting secrets.
I... Think that'd be okay. I probably overreacted.
we just wanna keep Bethany's innocence as long as we can.
Oh, we totally agree.
kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days.
no kidding. I want my girls to believe in santa claus as long as possible.
they're gonna find out soon enough that it's All a lie.
what? There's no santa claus?
so... Next playdate's monday at 1: 00?
wow, whoever did this really went to town.
Yeah, I know. Damn kids.
by the way, Did you put any more thought into joining the band?
Oh, man. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to get back to you.
I appreciate the offer, But I'm really stretched thin these days.
Oh, come on. Every man's got Time for a little music.
believe me, I'd love to play with you guys,
but, uh, I live 30 minutes away-- an hour in traffic.
whatever Time i've got left's for my son.
Yeah, I hear ya.
Hey, you ever look into living a little closer by?
with the rent prices in this neighborhood?
I might play guitar like a rock star, But I don't earn like one.
Yeah. Sorry. I wasn't thinking.
Oh, it's All right.
uh, appreciate you trying to help.
believe me, I wish I could do more.
I've never seen Bree so happy. She's glowing.
she won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book.
I'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign Is this dinner roll.
Yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign.
your Martini was as dry as the ad campaign. Let it go.
Hi, everybody! You having a good Time? - Hey, beautiful!
um, this is-- - Stu!
Lynette Scavo. I thought that might be you.
everyone, this is my old assistant, Stu, um...
well, this was one great guy.
he would schlep All the way across town Just to get me my chinese food.
so... What are you up to?
actually, Stu's company is doing all my advertising.
your company? You have a company?
three years now. How about you?
are you still at, uh, Parcher & Murphy?
no, i... Also went into business for myself.
her place makes the best pizza in town.
you own a pizzeria?
well, it's really my husband's.
and I'm still doing some freelance Stuff.
well, that's great. You know, we're Always working late.
give me your card. We'll order from you some night.
you know, of course, we're across town, So it May be a bit of a schlep.
it w great catching up, Lynette. - Yeah.
Bree, let me introduce you to some people.
Yeah, mm. Great.
there's my beautiful wife. What are you up to?
Why? Looking for a reason to scream at me?
you're right. I was awful the other day.
how about I make it up to you By buying you mrs. Hudson's house?
Seriously?
well, I thought about it, and I agree.
it's a good investment opportunity.
thank you!
thank you. Thank you.
and I promise that we'll rent that place out for top dollar.
Oh, I'm not worried about that.
but first... I want to do someone a favor.
where are you? It's after 2: 00.
I'm getting ready for my job interview.
Oh, that's not until 4: 00.
I'm reading the company's annual reports. I want to be prepared.
Oh, honey. Everybody's asking about you.
I want you to be here. It's my big day.
well... Enjoy it. You've earned it.
you know what this tastes like? More.
it would seem Somebody's taking their designated driver position... A little lightly.
Stu? Stu is doing Bree's ad campaign?
I rode in his hatchback once.
it smelled like mu shu. I gotta warn her.
Oh, wait! No, honey. Why don't you wait till after the ceremony?
Yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same Time.
guys, I am just gonna offer her a little advice.
still waiting.
the great thing about the internet is that With a minimal investment,
you actually can reach All your specific target audience
coupons.
coupons?
do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies.
knock off 20% On some of the items featured in your recipes,
then they do the same Towards the purchase of your cookbook.
Yeah, our research shows, you know, People aren't so hot on gimmicks
zip it, Stewie.
would you excuse us, please?
Lynette, you're drunk.
Yeah, that's immaterial.
what do you think of the coupons?
Lynette, I am really not able to deal with that right now.
I know.
you've got your book and--and your big fancy award, And I'm just a housewife.
I never said that.
you know, when I had a high-powered career,
and you were just a housewife, I never looked down on you.
if you could All please take your seats, It's Time to present our award.
you need to leave now.
fine. And don't worry.
even though I'd like to, I'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene.
I, um, I bought m. J. So stilts, Thought I'd teach him how to use 'em.
uh, actually, he's at Juanita's watching a dvd.
do you want me to call him? - No. No, it's cool.
I just wanted to tell him about my new place.
you're moving again? How far are you gonna be away now?
the Hudson house? - Yeah, she sold it.
and Edie told me the new owner wants to rent it,
so now i'll have a fighting chance Of being around when m. J. Hits his milestones.
is this okay with you?
Yeah. It's great.
uh, we'll be like...
one big, happy, divorced family.
you sure?
it's a little weird.
I-- i but, you know, m.J. Will be thrilled, and...
Yeah, I'm fine with it.
good.
so, um... I'll see you around, neighbor.
I still think it's strange You won't let me tell Mike that we're the new owners.
well, the man's got a lot of pride.
I want him to feel like I'm his neighbor, not his landlord.
landlord? Hell, with the rent we're charging him, You're his fairy godmother.
all right, consider it an investment in good karma.
screw karma.
I finally do something nice in this neighbhood, And I can't even brag about it?
the man who is silent in his good deeds Is the man who reaps the greatest reward.
so... Give me some guidance.
do I grovel, send flowers, or... Just move?
I'm not angry with you.
I'm just sorry that you felt so
drunk? Jealous?
you have nothing to be jealous of.
don't give me that.
you are having the kind of success I only dreamed of back in my ad days.
but that doesn't mean I look down on you.
no. But watching you, I look down on me.
when I held your book in my hands, I felt so jealous my stomach hurt.
and I thought, if I could just hitch a ride,
have a piece of it, I wouldn't feel so bad about your success.
for god sakes, Lynette, stop calling me a success.
there's nothing successful about me.
my friends think I'm gonna drop them, My partner resents me, And my husband...
has moved into the guest bedroom.
everything I gain comes at some horrible price,
and I'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it.
it is.
you're at the start of an incredible journey,
and I am going to be there every step of the way, Cheering you on,
telling anyone who will listen That the Bree Van De Kamp is my friend.
Thanks.
and the rest of the Stuff...
you'll find a wayto fix it.
just know that All your friends are very proud of you.
bitterly jealous, but proud.
if you look closely Into the faces of those around you,
you will catch a glimpse Of a certain Green-eyed monster.
and then you'll see they envy your career...
your love life...
the Time you spend with their child...
how do you deal with such jealousy?
there are many ways.
but the best...
is to simply share What you have.
thank you.
promise me you'll never leave our bed again.
I promise... Partner.
hello. It is me, your husband.
at least, legally still your husband, as recognized by the state of New York.
and, in the end, who are we to argue with the Governor?
I wanted to call and just say hello, as it is approaching the three-month anniversary of our being separated, and I thought, perhaps it might be nice to get together, as, you know, occasions like this only come around once in a lifetime.
and... Oh, yes! And I saw the cover of New York Magazine's real estate issue, and there you were. And you looked lovely, frankly.
you are staring out from every newsstand and bus and taxi.
and it is...
it is genuinely incredible how you have built your business "into the premier boutique real estate firm in the city" .
I'm quoting here from the article. I have five copies.
this way, if we ever get back together and lose yours, we're covered.
Hi. You've reached Meryl Morgan. I can't take your call right now, so leave a message and have a great day. Thanks.
anyway, the point is that I am sad, and I miss you, and I bitterly regret what I did, and it would be very, very nice if you called or, in fact, if we could see each other.
I hope you're getting the gifts. I know they're not all perfect.
the ice sculpture, I concede, was a disaster.
I did specify that they shouldn't leave it if you weren't home, and I will be suing.
talking of which, I must get back to work.
I'm actually in court. I have a man...
isn't this a beautiful view? You could pay for this whole apartment just by charging people to come and look at this.
and if you like this, you're going to love this, what I call the ballroom or the grand salon.
it's the perfect combination of classic architecture and understated elegance.
you're pregnant?
I mean, if you're planning on having a baby, this is the most magical place.
how many children do you have?
how many? Let me see, I have... Well, I have zero.
my husband and I are separated.
I know what you're thinking, the clock is ticking, right?
but I'm, you know... I'm considering adoption, and you gotta stay optimistic. You know?
don't get down on yourself.
Mr. Morgan, I have the depositions on the Anderson case for you.
excellent. I hear it's a page-turner.
now, where are we on the star front?
well, you can buy and name a star "Meryl" .
it's $75, and you get a celestial map and a certificate.
well, I was really looking for something more impressive.
can I buy a constellation?
I don't know. You can buy a black hole.
I'm not sure a black hole sends exactly the right message at this point in our relationship.
somewhat redundant.
thank you.
and thank you to everyone at the National Breast Cancer Foundation.
I'm so honored to be here tonight on behalf of Park Avenue Realty.
thank you to Jimmy, my waiter, at table number two. Yes, you.
I'm not done with my dessert yet.
this disease represents a crisis.
are we going to use this crisis to come out stronger, better and more powerful than ever before?
you bet we are.
but...
but what that means...
I'm sorry.
well, I...
basically, what I'm saying is, we want your money right now.
so...
great speech. - Thank you.
and you look fantastic tonight, by the way. - Thank you.
I still don't entirely understand what you're doing here.
well, breast cancer. I'm against it.
look, I just want to talk. I'll talk now, I'll talk later, I'll talk tomorrow.
I'll talk at lunch, dinner, brunch, snack time.
okay, okay. I get it.
you are available for talking.
Yes. Yes.
Hey, Jackie.
Jackie, how very nice. How are you?
Mr. Morgan.
what do I have tomorrow?
the PETA lunch.
barbecue, I imagine.
what about after lunch?
excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Morgan.
Hi, Adam.
after lunch, you have the Farmer conference call.
do I dare ask about dinner?
Meryl's doing a showing at 7: 00 for Mr. Rabelais.
we've got Mr. Thompson for dinner at 7: 00.
Hey, you know, I think it would just be easier if Jackie and Adam spoke to each other.
excellent idea. - Excuse us.
what happens with Paul after lunch?
well, he's got... - Don't mumble, Adam. Enunciate.
how's the apartment? - It's good.
so much more space without the golf clubs. - Yes.
how's the hotel? - It's nice. It's nice.
there's no one setting the snooze alarm for 15 minutes before they actually want to wake up, so that's nice.
Yes, and I've really enjoyed not having anyone walk into the master bedroom wearing their shoes and trailing dirt and germs from all over the city.
that must be very, very nice. - It is.
as is not stepping on discarded Lady Gillettes in the shower, which I have actually come to miss.
I can push Mr. Rabelais to 9: 00
and Adam can reschedule Mr. Morgan's dinner.
I think I can if I... - Just do it. Be a man.
excellent. Then shall we say Daniel at 7: 00?
okay.
great. Terrific. - Great. Good night.
good night.
so...
did you get the yucca? I know you like plants.
and far, far away, there is now a galaxy called Meryl.
you have to stop sending things. It's just getting very awkward.
I understand. I will. I promise.
I just have one more little thing.
okay, look, I know you always wanted us to go and I procrastinated, but I thought this might make up for it.
Dr. Tobin is apparently the best marriage counselor in the city.
Oh, no, I know who she is. I found her duplex on Madison.
okay. And the Lerners recommended her.
Eric and Fiona? - Yes.
they've been divorced a year. - They have, they have.
but the one thing they do agree on is how much they love Dr. Tobin.
apparently, she wrote some book.
Yes. The Magic Marriage Myth.
you see? You are so well-read. I really miss that.
it's all about people's expectations that their spouse will be the answer to all their problems when, in fact, they should be facing reality and not asking their partners for more than they can give.
brilliant. Brilliant.
I don't know. I find her theory kind of depressing, don't you?
Yep. Yep, yeah, if you do.
can you please stop being so agreeable? Please?
whatever you say.
so. - So.
so, you know, I have to do a showing tonight, and I'm gonna pick up my client at his townhouse.
Yes.
do you wanna walk with me?
Absolutely. Yes. - Okay.
Adam, we are gonna walk.
you're going to walk? - Yes.
is everything all right? Did we do something wrong?
no. Everything's okay.
you did something wrong.
here comes the rain.
you slept with someone else, Paul.
you are not good at talking about the weather.
all right, it's...
it's overcast with 100% chance of precipitation.
you slept with someone else. - I am sorry.
I was confused. I was an idiot. I was wrong.
I made a terrible mistake. I love you.
do you still love me at all?
I don't know if I can sort of love you or love you a little.
well, I'm fine with it.
honestly, I can get by with a little less love for a while. Maybe years.
that's not me.
I have to go. I have the meeting.
look, I just think we should give Dr. Tobin a chance.
you know... - Hey, there's my client.
what is he doing in the rain without an umbrella?
what are we doing in the rain without an umbrella?
Mr. Rabelais?
mister...
God!
run! - Stop!
get in! - What is your problem?
I almost ran you over! - There's a man up there with a gun!
the man who was murdered tonight, Girard Rabelais, was an international arms dealer.
the FBI was moving in to convict him, so Rabelais was working with us to capture this man,
Anton Forenski.
and we think that's why Forenski had him killed.
we find the murderer, maybe he leads us to Forenski.
and you're gonna be our star witnesses.
but right now, I just wanna concentrate on keeping you safe.
what do you mean, "safe"?
this guy's still out there. - Yeah, but he doesn't know who we are.
I'm gonna give you 24-hour protection at your apartment anyway.
well, we don't live together.
he's at a hotel 'cause we're separated.
my wife and I see someone once a week.
it's not, by any chance, Dr. Tobin, is it?
I know it's been a rough night, so get some rest, and I'll talk to both of you tomorrow.
okay. - Right.
Mrs. Morgan. - Yes?
this is Marshal Henderson. He'll be taking care of you.
hello. - Ma'am.
do you want me to stay tonight?
no, no. I think I'm gonna be fine with Marshal Henderson.
if you think he can handle it. Well...
Mrs. Morgan, I have your car right over here.
well, good night. - Good night. Good... Yeah.
Mr. Morgan, Marshal Ferber.
evening, sir. - Evening. Evening.
you're in good hands.
Yes. Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.
Yeah, it's done.
that is good news, Vincent. We'll meet tomorrow on the island.
no problem.
Hello? Hi, Marshal Lasky.
you're gonna send someone to relieve Marshal Henderson.
that's good, because, you know, he's been out there all night.
he must be...
can you hold on just a second? My intercom is ringing.
okay, I'm just gonna put you on hold. Okay.
coming.
Hi, Mike.
Yep, okay. Thank you.
thank you.
Hi. So I guess your guy's already here, because the doorman said they just sent a police officer up.
what?
Hey, how you doing?
okay, okay. Okay.
get back inside! - What...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
help!
stop pushing the buttons.
there's an emergency.
well, I certainly hope so, Marshal.
thank you. Do you mind? Do you mind?
not at all.
we checked the building's security camera, but he was pretty careful about keeping his head down.
so is Marshal Henderson okay?
he was wearing his vest. He'll be all right. But this guy is still out there.
I recommend you both enter the Witness Relocation Program.
what? - What?
hang on. Hang on. - Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
do you mean where they send you out into the middle of nowhere?
yeah? Oh, no. - Okay, I'll tell you what.
no, no, no, no, no. - Why don't we just look at all the options, because I'm sure there are options.
and where? What? Where do we go?
we can't reveal that until you're on the jet. - There's a jet?
so, it's out of the city? - Here's what I think we should do.
let's just stay logical and examine all the parameters, if that's possible.
I can't leave. I can't leave. I have a company to run.
well, we've both got companies to run, - So that's important, but I think... - Right.
right. So, who runs my business?
all I'm saying is, I think there are other things which should...
and what about... - For instance...
...all of our friends and our family?
what, we just up and disappear?
I mean, we'd leave? That's crazy. That's nuts. Is that what you're suggesting?
well, we don't know what he's suggesting because you haven't actually stopped talking yet, so...
well... - Excuse me.
this isn't the first time we've done this.
we'll get a list of people to contact.
but first, we've got to get you to a safe location.
and what happens if you never find this man?
we'll find him.
in the meantime, we put you in a temporary spot until we can find a more permanent site.
what do you mean by "permanent"?
I don't mean permanent. I mean official site.
Yeah, but you said permanent.
so if you don't catch this guy, then the official site becomes the permanent site?
right, so why don't we just let him explain that bit.
Oh, no. No, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't do this.
really, I can't. I'm, you know...
I'm a New Yorker. You know, I was born here. This is my home.
I've had bagels in other parts of the country.
I don't even like Connecticut.
this man is a professional killer.
he found you in one night, and he'll keep coming back.
wouldn't you rather live someplace else than die in New York?
Meryl?
I'm thinking.
there's nothing to think about. If you want to live, you're out of options.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to drag our personal problems into this, but at this exact moment,
I can't commit to spending the rest of my life with my husband.
I know exactly how you feel.
this is just a temporary location. You'll be there a week at most.
we'll look into arranging separate sites afterwards, but first, we've got to get you out of the city.
you... I don't...
you won't tell me where I'm going, so I don't know how to dress.
this, 'cause it's pretty?
now that we're on the jet, can you tell us where we're going?
ray, Wyoming.
is that anywhere near Phil, Wyoming?
here are your temporary IDs.
you'll be in seclusion, but just in case you run into anybody, we don't want you using your real identities.
Meryl Foster?
you'll be under the care of Marshal Clay Wheeler.
he's also the sheriff in town.
Meryl, you're Clay's cousin from Chicago.
you haven't seen him in five years, since he visited you and Paul.
any questions? - Do we get a movie?
we're here. It's time.
marshal Wheeler will take good care of you.
you're not coming?
I'm going back to find this guy. Good luck.
goodbye.
Yeah, thank you, Marshal.
thank you.
thank you, Marshal. Thank you.
is that him?
if it is, I feel safer already.
Oh, my God.
what?
you're gonna love this.
well, should we be writing this down?
don't worry, they're all over town. The posters, not the bears.
Hi, are you...
glad to see you? You bet.
take your bag? - Thank you.
Thanks. - Come with me.
try to stay awake there, Tom.
welcome to Wyoming. I'm U. S. Marshal Clay Wheeler.
thank you, hello.
hello. I'm Meryl Morgan.
no, I don't think so, ma'am.
you mean I've been wrong all these years?
you're Meryl Foster.
I'm your cousin.
you cold?
we were just only allowed to bring one bag, so I just packed a ton of underwear and a strapless gown.
same here.
temperature really drops around here at night.
let's see about getting you something warm.
thank you. I mean, if there's, you know, any place that's open.
sure, there's a Bargain Barn.
I've gotta swing by there anyway.
I've never been to a Bargain Barn.
are you pulling my leg?
they don't have them in New York.
what's that got to do with anything?
well, that's why I've never been to one.
I'm still not following you.
they don't have Bargain Barns in New York, so that's why I've never been to one.
we've also never been to one in Chicago, which is where we're from.
I see. - Oh, jeez.
it's huge.
I had no idea. - Astonishing.
it's all about bulk.
this can't be right.
a sweater for $9. 99?
it's not right. Look, it's two for one.
come on.
where is menswear?
wait a minute.
okay, look, you see that woman?
see that woman? Guess what's in those bags?
french bread? - Guns. Big guns.
Oh, Lord, she's coming. - Oh, my God, it's Sarah Palin.
actually, the name's Emma, Emma Wheeler, but you can call me Deputy Wheeler.
so... So you're married. - Oh, yeah.
just what you needed, hon. A couple more guns.
I love them. Do you hunt, Meryl?
just for bargains. Actually, I'm a member of PETA.
people for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
so am I. Except mine's "People for Eating Tasty Animals" .
you gotta know Emma to appreciate her humor.
sometimes that doesn't even help.
Hey, I just wanna say that I think what you people are doing is very brave, and it'll be an honor to protect you.
I hope you'll be real comfortable here with us.
thank you. Thank you very much.
I must say, I'd imagined Ray to be, you know, less modern.
but this Bargain Barn is fantastic, and I saw a movie theater down the road, an Applebee's.
well, this is Cody. Ray's 45 miles that way, and there is no Bargain Barn there.
here's Ray.
that was it.
could we do it again? I think I missed it.
well, if that's Ray, where are we going?
a few miles outside of town.
we like to get away from the hustle and bustle.
come on in. Watch your step, there.
Yep.
this is it, home sweet home.
well, it's lovely. It's very, very nice.
Yes, I love what you've done with the heads.
Thanks. Yeah, we killed all these animals ourselves.
that's great. I hate when you have the decorator do it for you.
well, I got a brother over in Cheyenne who's a taxidermist, so...
that's handy.
any word from New York?
no, ma'am. - So, you folks hungry? We got plenty to eat.
no, not me. I had my fill on the forced-out-of-New-York flight.
Chicago. - Chicago.
well, you probably wanna be getting some shut-eye. I'll show you to your room.
okay. - Hope you'll be comfortable here.
we fixed up the spare bedroom. Not exactly the Ritz.
we usually only have one witness at a time.
the last one was Vito "the Butcher" Emmanuel.
murdered five people before he turned state's evidence.
so you actually do this all the time? - Yeah.
about 10 years ago, the government asked if we'd hide somebody for a week.
ever since then, a couple of times a year, they bring somebody by.
been kind of interesting, actually.
now they want me to retire.
so, you two are gonna be our last.
well, it's an honor, and it's a lovely witness room, but Mr. Morgan... Mr. Foster and I are separated.
we are thinking of seeing a therapist, yeah.
so how do you want to handle the sleeping arrangements, then?
well, I can sleep on a couch. - No, no, no, no, I'll sleep on the couch.
no, no, 'cause I'm a lousy sleeper anyway. Really.
I'd be fine on a couch. And do you have cable?
we got an antenna. Got a bunch of DVDs.
John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, mostly.
that's great. That's great.
but I see you have a computer.
so that means that you have Internet? You're online?
we do, but you would need a code.
which you're not gonna give me.
no. Trying to contact somebody back home's just too big a risk.
and I guess the same goes for the phone?
cause I just have a couple of things I have to check on.
Yes, if I could make one quick call, it would be...
Yeah, and you know, you could supervise the calls.
there's no dial tone.
there's a code.
so I guess that is about it.
there's towels and soap in the bath.
great. Terrific. Is there a code?
sorry. Silly.
you sure you're going to be happy on that thing?
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
all right.
good night.
night, night. Night, everyone.
look, Paul, I know how hard you're trying. Really, I do. I'm not completely oblivious.
and believe me, it would...
it would be so much easier if I could just make myself forget.
but when I look at you, I just feel regret and sadness and a deep desire to see you suffer intense pain.
listen, that's not a problem. That is not a problem.
I am more than willing to hurt myself. Or would you prefer to do it?
whatever it takes.
look, just tell me what to do. Tell me.
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm...
Yeah. Look, the thing is, Meryl, I'm just trying to be realistic.
you know, I'm human, I made a mistake. I'm not perfect.
no, I know you're not.
but I was so in love with you, and now I'm just...
I'm just...
I'm so disappointed, and I don't trust you anymore.
okay.
good night.
night.
Jackie, did you hear about the Morgans?
of course I heard. I'm totally devastated.
they're in protective custody. - Adam, I heard.
what are we going to do? - What can we do? We can't...
yes? - There's a client here for Mrs. Morgan.
sure, send him back.
can I help you?
if you're busy, I can come back later.
not at all. He was just leaving.
Yeah, I'm in the market for a two-bedroom. A friend referred me to Meryl Morgan.
would you have a seat? - Yeah.
excuse me.
call me.
I'm Jackie, Mrs. Morgan's assistant. She's not in today.
can I get one of the other agents to talk to you?
you know, if she's as good as everyone says, then I'm sure she's probably worth the wait.
she is.
all right. Well, I'm sorry to have taken up your time, then.
not at all.
that's a nice looking muffin, there.
enjoy your breakfast.
Howdy. Hope I didn't wake you.
Oh, no. No. I didn't really sleep. It's too quiet here.
you hungry?
it smells good.
now, that's impressive. I've never turned my oven on.
wow, look at that, fire comes out and everything.
do you want sausage or bacon or both with your eggs and pancakes?
Oh. No, no, thanks. I'm actually a vegetarian.
morning.
I got news for you, Sheriff. Your cousin, here, is a vegetarian.
you never think it's gonna happen in your own family.
Howdy. - Howdy.
morning. Morning.
morning.
morning. - How'd you sleep?
not brilliantly. It's very, very quiet, isn't it?
I thought I could actually hear my cells dividing.
Yeah, I know. I kept praying for a siren.
Yes, or a rumbling subway or something.
speaking of New York, have you heard anything?
no, ma'am. And you can ask every 5 minutes.
when they tell me, I'll tell you.
I saw a photo of a young man. Is that your son?
that's our boy, Clay Jr.
does he live in Ray, too?
no, he married a girl from Omaha so he moved to the big city.
the big city? - Omaha.
here you go. Sunny-side eggs, sausage with bacon, home fries, homemade biscuits and country gravy.
can I get you anything else? - No, thanks. Just an angiogram.
we're gonna make our rounds. Probably best for you to stay put.
fewer people see you, the safer you are.
which is a shame, 'cause Ray is the friendliest place on Earth.
help yourself to anything in the fridge if you're hungry.
we'll be back in a couple of hours.
thank you. - Thank you.
I can't believe this is happening.
well, at least you didn't have the whole breakfast.
I feel my organs shutting down one by one.
I thought Disneyland was the friendliest place on Earth.
no, no, no. Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth.
ray is the friendliest place.
people probably get them confused all the time.
what if we never get out of here?
what if we never go to Lincoln Center again, or see the Mets, or see our friends, or sit on the Great Lawn reading The New York Times, or watch Shakespeare in the Park, or go to Nobu, or order Chinese.
Oh, God. Do you know how long it would take to order Chinese?
it'd be weeks and it would be cold!
okay, stop, stop, stop. Now, listen to me. Listen to me.
we are here, and there's nothing we can do about it.
there's no phone calls to make, there's no connections to work, there's no favors to call in.
I think that you should treat it as a vacation, a welcome break in your busy schedule.
okay. - Good.
okay, you're right. Okay.
there. Lovely.
Oh, God, I'm going mad! I can't take it!
well, at least you gave it your best shot. That's really all we can ask.
they did say not to leave. - Oh, come on.
well, perhaps I should come with you, to protect you.
and I'd really rather not be left here on my own.
Oh, God, I can't breathe. The air is too clean. Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
all right, I'm gonna shower. - Okay. I'm gonna...
Paul?
Paul, don't move. - Sorry?
there's a bear behind you.
Yes. Yes, there is.
Oh, shit. Just, shit.
wait! No, no, no, no! No, don't run! Don't run. The poster said not to run.
wait, hold on. I'm gonna go get it, okay? Hold on.
what? Come back. Meryl! Meryl, come back. Come back, please.
Meryl. Meryl. Meryl. Meryl.
okay. Oh, God. Okay. Well. Keep calm.
okay. "Avoid direct eye contact, and speak in a soft monotone" .
nice to meet you.
my wife is a member of PETA. I have been meaning to join.
don't shoot a bear... - I don't have a gun.
...because the bear almost always lives long enough "to maul the shooter severely.
I don't have a gun!
soothing. Soothing, soothing.
so sorry. Sorry. I don't have a gun. No gun.
wait. There's one last thing. - What is it?
you know, you don't need to hear this.
what is it? - Okay.
as a last resort, assume a cannonball position "covering your neck and your head with your hands and your arms" .
I didn't need to hear that.
well, I know that! I told you that! See? You never listen!
this is exactly what you do... - Could we not do this now?
...every single time. - Jesus.
Oh, my God, Paul! He's coming! - Don't scream. Be soothing.
run! - It says not to run.
run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
Oh, my God. My eyes! - Okay, he's going.
Yeah, he's going. We're gonna be okay.
I'm blind! I can't see! - Oh, my God.
Oh, wow, that was close. - I can't see.
my God.
Oh, Lord.
there you go.
okay. Let's have a look-see here.
you're from Chicago, Mrs. Foster? - Yep, that's right.
I've always dreamed about Chicago.
well, I'm sure one day you'll get there.
Oh, no, I don't wanna go. I just always dream about it.
is it gonna be much longer? Because my husband is very uncomfortable.
Oh, Lord in heaven. - Oh, yeah.
Oh, look at him. He's a mess. He should see a doctor.
laughter really is the best medicine.
so, you sprayed yourself with bear spray, Mr. Foster.
Oh, no. Actually, I sprayed him. I mean, unintentionally, of course.
anyway, do you think maybe he should see a specialist?
well, I'm the only doctor in town, so I'm about as special as it gets.
do everything from geriatrics to pediatrics.
wow, well, don't wanna confuse those two.
no. No, you don't.
that is the great thing about being a doctor in a small town. You see it all.
anyway, physiologically it's all the same. You know, the body is the body.
so, let's see if we can't take care of that boo-boo in your eye, Mr. Foster.
you see, just calling it a boo-boo makes me feel better already.
let's go next door to the exam room.
say, would you like to come along, Mrs. Foster?
Oh, no, I'm fine. I'll wait here.
let me help you there, Mr. Foster. Say, do you like stickers?
here, let's take a little visit to the giraffe room.
you've reached Trish Pinger at the Gotham Adoption Agency.
please leave a message.
Hi, Trish. This is Meryl Foster... I'm sorry, Meryl Morgan calling. I just...
I was just calling to thank you so much for everything that you've done for me, but I'm now sort of in the middle of something.
I might be relocating, I might be in New York,
I might be God knows where.
I bet I sound really stable right now, right?
probably can't believe you were gonna help me adopt a baby.
very soothing before bed.
okay. Good night. - Night.
Paul?
I called the Gotham Adoption Agency.
I filed for adoption two months ago.
you did?
so I wanted to tell them that I couldn't go through with it now.
two months ago?
must've been a big decision for you.
well, I really thought about telling you, but I didn't really know where we were at.
and to be honest, you know, from the time that we started having trouble getting pregnant, you weren't exactly supportive.
well, you know, I always find it almost impossible to believe that you say that, because between the fertility doctors and the injections and the woman who chanted over my sperm...
Oh, man, come on. I have apologized for that so many times.
...that I was pretty supportive.
was I enjoying having sex on a schedule timed exactly to your ovulations?
maybe not as much as I should've done, and I'm very sorry about that.
or talking about reproducing every second of every day.
it wasn't every second of every day. I just wanted to be a mother.
Yes, and I wanted to be a father.
I was the one who suggested adoption in the first place.
then why did we never meet with an adoption agency?
because, by that time, you had become so wired and so crazed that they would not have let us raise a goldfish, let alone a baby.
you know I was wired from the hormone shots, and I am not normally that crazy.
and instead of you staying home and dealing with it, you flew off to LA on a business meeting, and then you...
Oh, right. - I know! I know. I know what I did.
I slept with someone else, and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know how many times I'm supposed to say it.
I think you are being completely irrational.
these two are worse than Vito the Butcher.
I'd really prefer it if you'd not tell me what I think.
it's quite annoying. - I kind of like them.
don't lawyer me. - Fine!
I wish there was some way we could help them.
Yeah. Muzzles.
I think you are being unreasonable. - Well, you're wrong.
is that helpful? Is that constructive? Is that mature?
it's mature. I don't know if it's "mature" .
Oh, that is mature, yes. Mock my accent. Mock my heritage.
we have got to get them out of the house.
I didn't know what to do. There were all these meetings that were set, - All these clients. - You think you've got problems?
she's the president of the firm. Nothing happens here without her, and everyone is looking at me like, "Where is she?" .
I'm gonna lose my job. Without him, I'm superfluous.
well, I've got news for you. Even with him...
Meryl Morgan's office. She's not in today.
Hello, Miss Pinger. Yes, from the adoption agency.
what? Meryl called you. Yesterday.
do you happen to have that number?
Yes, if you could just hold.
hold on, just one moment. Yes, go ahead.
thank you so much, Miss Pinger. All right.
this is Mike, Clarence, Jackson and Windy.
this is the one we're gonna put you on, Meryl.
no, sorry. No offense, Windy, but I'm allergic to you.
and I had, once, a very bad horse experience. I was thrown.
it was from the carousel in Central Park, but still, you know.
you ride, Paul?
well, I do a little bit, yes. I had some lessons when I was a child.
you had riding lessons?
well, I never knew that.
Yeah, well, I don't tell you everything, so...
Yeah. I knew that.
go get her.
Hey! Hey! I'm not on my horse! I'm not on my horse!
get back on, 'cause we got target practice next.
Annie Oakley. - Very good.
all right. Come on, Meryl, your turn.
all right, let's just get this over with.
all right. This is a loaded gun, so you don't point it at another person or your own foot.
okay? - Okay.
and are you left-handed or right-handed?
well, you know, I write with my left hand, but I play tennis and I play badminton with my right hand.
I text with my right hand. I cut, right? I cut cake with my left hand.
okay, we're gonna do it like this. Line it up through the sights to the can.
now, when that gun goes off, it's gonna kick back - into your shoulder, okay? - Okay. Yeah.
don't put your finger on the trigger till you're ready to shoot.
all right.
this is nothing. You should see how long it takes her to order dinner.
there you go.
blew its head off. - That was good.
wow, it's very, very loud. - Yeah. Yeah.
no, no, no. 'Cause I got two more cans.
I'm just gonna cock the gun for you.
fascinating. A week ago, she was basically Amish.
all right. It's loaded and ready to go. - Okay. Yeah, I know. Okay.
keep your finger off the trigger till you're ready.
missed.
I think it's my turn now, isn't it? - No, no, no, I'm not done yet.
I think you'll find it's my turn.
I'm not done. I'm on a roll. - You've had two bullets, now it's my turn.
this thing is loaded.
I'm gonna have to give you two an NRA class.
Paul's turn. - Thank you.
you're rude. Selfish.
just do like your wife did. - Right, thank you.
get a hold of it, relax.
just relax. Find your target. Take a deep breath. Squeeze easy.
bollocks. God in heaven, that hurt. Agony.
missed. - Absolute agony.
could you take that for me just a second? I think I've really done some damage.
Meryl, I think I have a welt. - What?
quite a big welt.
look at that. Do you see that?
Yes, it's quite big. - Purple. Ugly. Like a little map of Ireland.
Yeah, real easy to hurt your shoulder shooting a rifle.
I didn't.
could you just wait outside? Play with a toy? Thank you.
you ever shoot before, Meryl?
Nope. Never held a gun before in my life.
although I could've used one during some tense negotiations at work.
I'm a real estate broker.
you kidding? - No.
my mom is getting on and she's moving in with me.
I can't get any bites on her house.
well, it's lovely.
but, you know, when the market's like this, you really need to focus more on presentation.
I mean, just, you know, just off of the top of my head,
I think maybe the chair that's sitting on the front lawn, it looks very, very comfortable, but have you ever considered moving it inside the house?
no.
well, just think about it. It's...
I will. - Okay.
would you mind coming out and taking a look at the place?
not at all.
can you spare her, Paul?
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, I'm used to being separated.
the shoulder, I mean. Shoulder.
that's not separated.
it's a tiny little bruise. Wouldn't hurt a schoolgirl.
hi there. Hey. - Hey.
how's your arm feeling?
it's nothing. It's nothing. I just went to the doc 'cause Meryl was so worried.
can I give you a hand, there?
if you're up to it. - Yeah, no problem.
so, I really just wanted to apologize for any trouble we may have caused you. You know, I know there's been a certain amount of screaming and shouting and so on.
that's okay. I know what it's like. Me and Clay had a few humdingers.
Really?
you see, that's quite comforting to hear, 'cause you two seem so happy.
we are. But it doesn't mean we haven't almost called it quits a few times.
Really?
how did you two patch things up, if I might ask?
well, he bought me a Remington. 270 with a night scope and "Emma" engraved on it.
and he gave me some cows. I love cows.
brilliant. Brilliant.
I wish I had thought of the cows thing. That's good.
Yeah, there was this one time, we were really butting heads.
something about his brother.
it's not important.
but, anyway, it got to where we weren't even hardly talking, and he asked me out on a date.
a date?
Yeah. Just like two kids in high school.
he asked me out, we went out to dinner, we talked and it worked like magic.
very interesting.
well, speaking of work,
I think we're probably pretty much done here, so I'll talk to you later.
thanks for coming. Just while we're standing here,
I just want to point out a few things.
this whole railing is brand-new, and, actually, Doc built it himself.
fresh coat of paint.
so I don't know if you guys wanna go inside, kind of get a lay of the land.
I'm staying with you. - You're staying with me?
I'm taking my boots off and climbing. - Listen, before you take those boots off, do you want to go look around and see how big this yard is?
Yeah. - I'm gonna be right back, 'cause I'm gonna have a very quick conversation with him.
Oh, and you know that kitchen wall?
show them, it's not bearing, so you can take it down.
you can build a gorgeous playroom for them.
what's up?
this may sound strange, but would you like to go on a date with me?
you know, that does sound strange.
it's been a while since we dined together. And I hope...
well, we just had dinner in New York.
and I thought that went well until the murder.
Hey, Meryl, you coming? - Oh, yeah. Just one minute. I'll be in. Sorry.
shall we say 7: 30? It's a place called Annette's.
I am told it is the only place to eat in town. Literally.
and it'll just be a chance to sit and talk like we used to, before the infertility.
and the infidelity. And the separation.
I will pay.
well, I mean, if you're gonna pay.
luckily, I called ahead and got a table near the mayonnaise.
you must know someone.
and I know you said no more presents, but I went online, under Emma's supervision, and downloaded a CD of New York noises to help you sleep.
car horns, subways, women fighting in Bloomingdale's.
I think you might actually be on here.
well, thank you. - Very welcome.
two salads. - Thanks, Kelly.
actually, I had asked for mine with the dressing on the side.
I thought you were kidding.
Yeah, I know, that always gets a laugh.
have you been a waitress a long time, Kelly?
forever.
I can't get by on nursing. There's just not enough sick people in town.
that's so unfair.
it's not so bad. Most people in Ray have two jobs. Some have three.
I'm also Assistant Fire Chief. - Oh, really?
then could you ask the gentleman behind us to please put out his cigarette?
Yeah, I can't do that. That's Earl. He owns the place.
well, why's it called Annette's? - Annette was his wife.
she divorced him about 10 years ago. He doesn't want to repaint.
excuse me?
Hi. I'm Meryl Foster. I'm Clay's cousin.
and this is my husband, Paul. We're visiting from Chicago.
Howdy-do? I'm Earl Granger. My granddaughter, Lucy.
Howdy. - Howdy.
I was just wondering, would you mind terribly blowing the smoke in another direction?
thank you.
Chicago?
I don't know how you do things in Chicago, I never been there, but this is God-fearing American country.
we don't take kindly to outsiders trying to tell us how to live.
well, people in Chicago are just as American and God-fearing as people in Wyoming.
I mean, not me, specifically. I'm an agnostic.
next thing you'll be telling us you're Democrats.
well, I mean, there's gotta be a few of us in town.
fourteen. And we know who they are.
thirteen, honey.
bill Herr died a month ago.
of natural causes, or is he...
you're not getting smart with me, are you, tea-drinker?
you know what I did to the last man who called me that?
I stole his crumpet.
doc.
howdy, Fosters. How are you tonight?
good. We just had a lovely meal at Annette's.
must be Earl's night off. - Yeah.
you okay?
well, we just need to call Clay and Emma. They said they'd pick us up.
they're playing poker with the Millers and the Caseys.
here, just take my truck. It's that one right there.
we couldn't possibly.
I don't need it till tomorrow. Door's open, key's inside.
Really?
Yeah, around here, everybody leaves their keys in case someone needs a ride.
you don't do that in the city?
well, people do take each other's cars, but...
Yes, yeah, but the return policy's a bit fuzzy.
well, you be sure to return mine, all right? - Okay, Doc, thanks.
thank you. - Good night, y'all.
Yeah. - Night.
which one was it? - I don't know. They're all exactly the same.
are we lost?
certainly not. I turned right at the broken fence.
and left at the second big rock?
second big rock?
Oh, no, then we are lost. All right, I'm going to turn right up here.
no, I'm not. I'm gonna go 'round. Hang on.
can I ask you something? - Yeah.
why her?
you want to discuss this now? In the middle of absolutely nowhere?
Yeah, I know it's probably not the time, but...
but why her?
I mean, you meet lots of women. You're always at lunches and meetings, so, why her? I mean, was it just that she was pretty?
who said she was pretty? She was quite hideous, actually.
a leper, really. I mean, if the Elephant Man had a sister, she...
I googled her.
Yeah, I just looked under "loose legal ladies" .
she's pretty.
so, what's she like?
she's reserved. I don't know, a bit cynical. You know.
Yeah, no, I can see that. That makes sense.
it was probably like, you know, going to a spa, you know, very quiet and cool and laid back, and nobody nagging you or asking you questions like some crazy, neurotic woodpecker who won't let go of an issue until it's been pecked to death. I know.
it was nothing. It was nothing. It was really nothing. It was...
you know, I was stupid. I'd had a few drinks.
I was upset about us.
and it just happened, and I did not enjoy it.
I was feeling guilty the whole time, and her perfume smelled a bit like a burrito.
and you are, easily, the sexiest, most exciting woman
I have ever been with or ever wish to be with.
I sort of believe you.
good.
progress.
maybe it wasn't the fragrance. Maybe she just smells like a burrito.
very possible.
Hi, Kelly. - Hi.
Hi.
Hi. - Morning, Lucy.
Lucy.
doc. - Hey, Doc.
howdy, Fosters.
it's a store. It's a real store.
of course they haven't got cashmere.
and when they say they haven't, don't just say, "Go and look" .
sorry. You never know. I mean, you just have...
so you're a lawyer.
sort of.
well, this is about my granddaughter, Lucy.
she's gonna be the next American Idol.
is she? Well, that's great. That's lovely. Good.
see, her dad's sick, and her mother's off to the Army.
so that leaves it up to old Grandpa to look after her.
truth is, I need a will.
okay, well, the problem is, I don't really practice that kind of law.
what do you practice? - No, no. He can do it. He can do it.
Hey, listen, I gotta go.
I told Doc that I would help him with his house today, you know.
so I'm just gonna go and shower, and I'll see you later, and have fun.
I've got my financials clear back to 1953.
good, great. That sounds fun.
okay. Okay. Well, you know what?
despite our cultural differences, I think you and I could be good friends.
or not. It's completely up to you.
do we have it? - Yes. Yes. Yes.
window shut. - Excellent. Well done.
we got N 3-2.
n 3-2. - Hey, how'd it go today with Earl?
really well. Yes. I made him such a beautiful will, he asked me to kill him.
well, look at you, country lawyer.
well, look at you. Country real estate person.
word is that Doc had an offer on his mum's house.
Yeah. She's incredible, right out the gate.
well, it was just past the second big rock, and you know what they say, location, location, location.
next up is B 4. B 4.
that's so funny. "B 4," like "before" .
like "B dash 4" and after.
never a fire when you need one.
G 46. That's G 4-6.
Oh, my God. Bingo!
bingo, bingo! Bingo! - Oh, my God! Bingo!
Yes. Yes!
come here.
why are we so happy?
we just won $15! That's three sweaters! - Yes! Yes!
please listen to me. You cannot call that number.
we've been over this, Jackie. You heard what the marshal said.
we could be endangering their safety. There are rules here.
my God, you're a scared little man.
haven't you ever done anything to break the rules?
hello. It's Jackie Drake, Mrs. Morgan's assistant.
Adam!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I am so sorry. It was a reflex.
I took a self-defense course. I got an A in Tasering.
would you like to go to a movie with me tomorrow?
I don't know... - Couldn't have enjoyed it more.
an exciting game. - It was surprising. I was really surprised.
Congratulations. - It was a great night.
see you tomorrow.
good night. - Good night.
night.
okay. I... Good night. - Night.
come in.
hello.
Hi. Are you asleep?
very much so, yes.
I hate to interrupt that, but you have to see this.
good God.
is that right?
I don't know.
I've never seen anything like it in New York outside the Planetarium.
let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments "Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds "Or bends with the remover to remove "O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark "That looks on tempests and is never shaken.
it's Shakespeare, from our wedding.
was he there? We never got his gift.
it was my vows to you. - I know. I know.
although, at the time, I thought you'd written them.
I was so disappointed when I found out.
do you remember your vows to me?
there was once a girl from Nantucket
no, that's not it. That's not it. That's not it. - No, it's all right. It was a long time ago.
my God, it's amazing how many stars.
I promise never to take you for granted "Or utter a word unkind "Never allow my affections to be recanted "Or stop marveling at your behind "To also marvel at your warmth, your wit "Your refusal to condone animal slaughter "Your wisdom, your laugh "Your inability to boil water "To be your best friend for the rest of my life "And to thank the God you're not sure about "For fooling you into being my wife.
and the next thing I heard was, "Do you, Meryl Judith Becker, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? "
and I said, "I do" .
you did, and then I heard, "Do you, Paul Michael Morgan, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? "
and your mother said, "He doesn't! "
but I ignored her, and then I heard, "I now pronounce you man and wife. "
and then I don't remember.
you may kiss the bride. - Right, right. Right.
you may kiss the bride. - Yes.
and then we had the buffet, beginning with the meatless pigs in blankets.
you may kiss the bride.
may I?
you sure?
I'm wavering, honestly.
sorry. Sorry. Sorry. - It's okay.
sorry, a bit out of practice.
Ow!
what do you mean, "Ow"? That was foreplay.
Hey, Marshal Lasky.
Yes, sir.
right. All right.
take care.
they got your separate sites ready, and they want you to leave tomorrow evening.
tomorrow? - Yep.
Wow. That soon, eh?
well, the good news is you still get to go to the rodeo.
and the rodeo dance.
Yes, yes.
Dr. Simmons' office.
Yeah, is this the Dr. Simmons in Columbus, Ohio?
no, this is the Dr. Simmons in Ray, Wyoming.
sorry, my mistake.
there's someone using your name in Columbus, Ohio.
you know what?
I think that's about it for me.
Really? - Yeah.
well, I probably did tire you out a bit last night.
God, I was amazing.
Yeah, I'm really glad I was there to see it.
Yeah.
all right. - Wait, listen.
with regard to the whole adoption thing, it is possible that I did drag my feet a little bit.
you would be a terrific mother, caring, supportive and completely smothering.
I know! I'm so looking forward to that.
but I am not sure that I would be good at it.
Really? That's what you're worried about?
a bit, yes, yes.
what makes you think I would be a good father?
well, if I had to pick one thing,
I would say it was the mouse.
what are you talking about?
don't you remember? You know, we had a mouse in our apartment, and then all of a sudden, the cereal box started moving?
Yes, yes. The shaky granola. Yes. - Yeah. And it ran out to our balcony, and, you know, you could have just taken a broom and swept it off, but instead, you stood there for hours trying to coax that little guy into a shoebox, using Jarlsberg from Zabar's.
Yeah, a terrible waste of cheese, seeing as it eventually leapt to its death, but...
and when I saw that, I just...
I knew you'd be a great father.
especially if we adopt a rodent.
thank you for being honest.
listen, while I am speaking honestly,
I wondered if we might also discuss the whole business of separate sites.
I don't want to pressure you... - No, no.
actually, no, I've been thinking about it, too.
you know, why don't you finish your jog, and we'll talk about it when you come back, okay?
okay.
take the bear spray. - Okay.
take the bear flyer. - Okay. Thank you.
clay?
come on in.
Hey, Clay? - Yeah?
Hey, I was just looking for Emma in the house.
is she around? I just wanted to talk to her.
she's gone into Cody for supplies. She'll be back in about an hour.
it's just...
as you can probably see, things are going much better between me and Paul, but, you know, some very big decisions need to be made in regards to our future, and the possibility that we're not going back to New York, and the fact is that, well, I slept with someone else while Paul and I were separated.
Emma will be back in about an hour.
well, I kind of don't know what to do.
grab a bucket.
okay.
so which of these are skim?
put your bucket under there. Get that stool.
grab a hold of a teat.
good luck.
well, you know, there's the school of thought that says what Paul doesn't know won't hurt him, and on some level, I guess it's almost narcissistic if I do tell him.
but how can I expect complete honesty from him if I'm asking any less of myself?
I mean, isn't that just the height of hypocrisy?
could be.
I don't hear much helping going on over there.
sorry.
Oh, God!
does this hurt them? - Not if you're gentle about it.
I get it.
Yeah, I get it.
you're telling me to be honest but to be gentle.
I was telling you to ease up on her teat.
but I guess it works both ways.
that's very wise. - I doubt that.
that stuff you're talking about isn't easy.
it's like that book, Men Are From Mars, and Women Are From Venus.
you read that book?
I read the cover. That pretty much summed it up.
ringer!
I give up, Clay. You're too good.
well, hello there. I'm glad you came.
thank you, Ray!
keep your dancing shoes on 'cause now we're gonna kick it.
come on, you're dancing. - Really?
I wanna tell you something. - I know, - I'm very light on my feet. - No. Well, yes.
but something else.
I think we should go to the official site together.
you do?
Yeah.
well, that is so great. - Good.
that is so great! - I know. I know.
and one other thing.
yeah?
while we were separated,
I slept with someone else.
switch partners!
it just happened once.
once.
really, and it was just because I was just...
I was feeling, you know, just hurt and rejected.
you're upset. - No, no, no.
I'm... What am I? I'm a little bit surprised, I suppose.
if you're gonna be mad, be mad, but please, please don't stop talking to me.
yell, scream, I don't care. You know, honestly, whatever you want.
there is nothing to scream about.
we were separated. You're an adult. These things happen, so there it is.
Hey, Paul. - Howdy.
do you wanna ask me something? - No.
do you mind? - No, no, no, no.
do you wanna talk?
no, no. Unless you do.
I always wanna talk.
go ahead.
it's okay. Never mind.
Hey, folks, welcome to Ray Rodeo.
calf ropin', bull ridin', pie-eating contest, great barbecue.
Hey, excuse me.
how you doing? - Howdy.
I'm looking for two friends of mine, Paul and Meryl.
Oh, the Fosters.
they're probably on their way to the rodeo, but they're staying with the Wheelers.
wheelers. And where's that?
okay, so go down this road, and when you see the broken fence, make a right.
and then, when you come to the second big rock...
morning.
better shake a leg if you want to eat.
do you know where Paul is?
thank you.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
who do you think this is fooling?
isn't this...
I mean, isn't this what screwed us up in the first place, not talking?
is it? Is it really? Sorry, it was stupid of me.
I thought it was sleeping with other people, but maybe you're right. Yes.
all right, you know what? Never mind.
all right. What would you like me to do?
would you like me to beg for information? Then I will.
what was his name? - Larry.
Larry? Are you serious?
Larry.
you know, he's recently divorced. He just asked me to dinner.
it's fine, it's fine, I think I got the picture.
and then you probably had a few drinks, and you moaned about your horrible husband, and then you went back to his apartment. I got it. I got it.
well, no, no.
went back to our apartment.
right, we're selling the place. Thanks so much for telling me.
probably... - You're upset.
look, we both made mistakes.
I made a mistake, yours seems just a little bit more like revenge.
are you serious?
I mean, do you... Do you not know me at all?
you think that I would sleep with someone for revenge. I would...
I would sleep with someone to hurt you?
well, at this point, I don't really know what I think of you.
Oh, my God. Screw you. - Can I just say this?
Meryl. Can I just... Can I speak? - No. You know what? No.
no. Not to me. - Wait, Meryl, I'm not finished. Meryl!
ready to go?
I think I'm gonna pass on the rodeo. Sorry.
Yeah. Sorry, me, too.
I have a lot of packing to do.
sorry.
okay, then.
hold on.
I know it's none of my business, but I've watched you two over the past four days, laughing together over your little inside New York jokes.
I don't find them funny, but I think that you can always tell a lot about a couple by the fact that they still laugh together.
Thanks, I appreciate that.
and, I think... Yeah, I think he's funny.
he makes me laugh.
but if we're gonna stay together, then, you know, I guess we have to scale back our expectations, and I won't expect everything from him, and he won't expect everything from me and...
you should expect everything from each other!
marriage doesn't make any sense!
you gotta stop thinking about it, and just get over all the bullshit and make it work.
look, I figured if she said something, I was gonna...
Oh, God. Come on, honey, let's just go.
we'll pick you up and take you to the airport.
I declare.
I have not heard you talk that much in...
well, I had to offer my two bits' worth.
shit!
what was that? - Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, it's him! - We gotta call Clay and Emma.
no, no. The phone has a code. - Christ!
excuse me.
what are you, kidding?
Oh, my God. I'm out of bullets.
something I never expected to hear you say.
we'll go out the back. Scuttle!
come on. Up, up.
come on, come on, come on. - I'm trying.
okay, Windy, go.
Oh, my God.
okay, we gotta find Clay.
should be easy. He's wearing a cowboy hat.
nice try, cowboy.
been a while since anybody rode this bull to the eight-second mark.
looks like old Buster won another round.
dumped him like a blushing bride at the altar.
doc Simmons and the boys have a dangerous job, protecting these bull-riding cowboys.
that's a lot of bull, and that ain't no bull.
Hey, that's Clay.
he's in the box. Go, go, go.
folks, let's have a big hand for our bull-fighting clowns.
folks, we got a little treat for you today before our next bull.
here's hometown trick-rider Carly Ames.
Oh, my God.
just sit. Just sit.
scuttle.
nice riding, Carly. Thank you.
folks, let's give her a big hand.
next up is Tom Willet.
Tom's riding the aptly-named bull, Killer.
the last three cowboys to get on this bull got dumped right out of the gate.
let's see if Tom can break that streak.
there he goes.
go get him, boys.
let's go, come on!
old Killer's living up to his name today.
what's happening? I can't see.
Oh, my God.
what's that noise? - Oh, God. Just run!
just run! - I'm running! I don't have a choice!
Meryl, you all right? - No.
I really think I hurt my leg. - Oh, God.
I don't think I can walk.
Oh, my God. We're never gonna get away from him.
what? Where is he?
Oh, God.
all right. Wait there. Wait there. I'll be back in a minute.
wait, what, what? Wait, what are you doing? Where are you going?
please, don't leave me. Paul! - Just keep your head down.
bollocks!
Hey. I got plenty of room on my wall for another head.
drop it, son. Step back away from my lawyer.
I should just point out that even if you kill me, you now have two more witnesses who will testify against you.
three. - Four.
five. - Five.
you're six, Kell. - Six.
Oh, my God.
you all right?
are you crazy? You could have been killed.
I am just very touched that that would've bothered you.
well, of course it would have.
Oh, God, I had this...
this horrible moment where I pictured what life would be like without you.
that's exactly what I had.
when you were lying here, sprawled in the dust, all I wanted to do was protect you.
I lost all physical fear.
it's coming back now, though. What in God's name was I thinking?
I know exactly what you were thinking.
you were thinking that we're meant to be together, because look what you did.
you risked your life for me.
that's so nice.
no. - Sorry.
no, no. I am sorry.
I am so sorry for nearly curing an incurable romantic.
I want you to expect everything from me.
you're not gonna get it, but I promise to try and give it.
I love you, Meryl.
if you are in fact Meryl. I can't really see, I'm sorry.
I'm Meryl, trust me.
cause I trust you all over again.
watch your head, please.
goodbye, Lucy. I hope I get to hear you on the radio soon.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Earl. - Lucy.
eat some meat. - Eat some meat. Okay.
okay, good. Good. - Take care.
Earl, I think we've become good friends.
think what you want. - Or not. Whatever.
so... - I don't know what to say, except we are really, truly sorry about...
about everything. - Yeah.
don't be.
the Feds are so happy with us, they're letting Clay keep his job.
is that right? That's great news.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan, we're ready for you.
okay. Well, I suppose this is it.
if we're ever attacked by a bear in Central Park, we will be the only ones who know what to do.
you just take good care of my favorite cousin, okay?
Emma. - Goodbye, Paul.
really, thank you for everything, and remember my wood-chopping tips.
I'll never forget your wood-chopping. - It's mainly wrist, it's less arm.
clay, I'm gonna hug you. You won't like it, but I'm gonna hug you.
thank you. And listen, if you're ever in New York...
something has gone terribly wrong.
okay. Well, let's go home.
all right. - Come on.
how's your foot?
sheriff, your life just got a whole lot simpler.
so did yours, babe.
isn't it amazing that she slept the whole flight?
is that amazing?
are they not meant to do that? - Yes.
is she faulty? - Faulty?
no, she's perfect.
perfect, but nameless.
well, perhaps we'll finally come up with a name on the road home.
she could be Midtown Tunnel Morgan.
59th Street Bridge Morgan.
Hey, there's Adam and Jackie. Hi.
get their bags.
should I get a cart? - You are the cart. Go.
Hey.
thank you, honey. - You're my girl.
go.
hurry, get that. Get the phone.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Adam, I've missed you.
no, no, no, I'm taking the day off tomorrow, so you do not need to come in.
Yes, I'm sure.
well, in that case, have fun moving Jackie's mother's furniture.
I see many happy years ahead of you.
okay, bye.
you know what I wish?
I wish that as an older, wiser couple, we could give them some advice like Clay and Emma gave us.
or we could just send them to Ray for the weekend.
Rae.
we'll call her Rae. R-A-E. Rae.
I quite like that. I quite like that.
do you like that? - Yes.
no, no, not you. You. What are your thoughts?
Rae? - Rae Morgan.
Hey, this is our new apartment, Rae.
it's the one we had to get because I didn't want to stay in the old one after Mummy slept there with Larry.
she doesn't need to hear this.
now, listen.
come here, little girl. It's got...
come on.
...3, 000 square feet.
and a very spacious master bedroom.
and come see this view. Come look at this view, little lady.
right here, look at that.
can you believe?
is that something?
it is, it is.
that is quite a beautiful view.
what? What?
how are you feeling, by the way? - Good.
everything all right? - Very good.
it'll be funny if this one comes out Chinese, as well.
Hi. You've reached Meryl Morgan. I can't take your call right now, so leave a message and have a great day. Thanks.
Meryl? Meryl? Meryl?
Meryl? Meryl?
Hi, Lucy.
Julia, what are you doing here?
you ruined my life.
I was thinking about that article you wrote.
it was actually pretty good.
but I have some cuts.
you reap what you sow, Lucy.
guess that whole reaping what you sow thing works both ways.
Hey, it's me again. Don Konkey,
dirt Now's resident schizophrenic.
dad, I think it's time.
and photographer.
I take photos of celebrities and sell 'em to my best friend and boss Lucy Spiller, the editor of DirtNow magazine.
so much to catch you up on, so try and keep up.
it all started when Holt McLaren sold info to Lucy about Kira being pregnant.
after Lucy broke the story, Kira OD'd and died.
after hearing about Kira's death,
Holt freaked out and flipped his car with his girlfriend, big star Julia Mallory, and that's when things got really complicated.
Lucy and Holt kind of had sex.
Oh, God. - A lot.
Julia started to slide into the world of drugs and sex.
Jesus Christ, Julia, what the hell are you doing?
and then leaked her own sex tape then claimed she was raped.
she'd have gotten away with it if Lucy hadn't found out - and published the truth. - This is a great cover.
I'm really worried about her.
she's been in a coma now for two weeks.
I'm all she has left.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
anyway, I'm just really hoping Lucy wakes up and things get back to normal.
you're all right, Lucy.
Yeah, you're all right.
Yeah, you're okay.
you got hurt, but now you're okay 'cause you're safe.
Oh? Oh.
all right, Miss Spiller.
you're all right.
just try to say something.
uh... uh...
I think she's asking for her mother.
no, no, no, no. Listen.
the cover.
cover.
this is great. This should be a sidebar.
okay, lose the drop cap on this one.
we're not The New Yorker.
I've asked for the sales numbers twice.
what's up?
Terry's ??
bringing them over? Call her.
she needs her rest.
no, no, Don. - Go.
don, I'm fine.
that's because you've been getting a rest.
how's the injection going?
Yeah. They mix the drugs with sesame oil to cause it to time release.
just regular sesame oil. Like a stir fry.
don't-- Don't
Ah. - Um...
I can't believe I'm looking at you.
now I know you were here the whole time.
I could feel you.
it's night, Don. You got to go home.
you do. You got to sleep in your own bed.
I don't care how many pizza boxes or newspapers are piled on it.
you got to go home.
okay. Come on, have some tea.
Oh, thank you.
that hurts.
how you doing, buddy?
you're getting bigger all the time.
Oh.
david Fincher described you as an actor possessed and deeply instinctual.
the movie tracked well with men 18-34, even better with women.
that's good to know.
while your reviews were excellent, the movie probably won't receive a nomination because it's considered a genre film.
listen, man, can I come in?
who told you were I live?
a woman, 18 to 34.
right. - Yeah.
I don't have any beer.
you drink Bud, Corona, Rolling Rock.
I do have some cheese, however.
what's that smell?
my cat.
Ahem.
did you tell her I tried to visit her?
Yeah.
no. I, uh...
she needs to rest.
uh, I miss her.
you're the only who knows, so if you could just tell her I miss her?
please?
okay.
how's she doing?
she thinks she's better than she is.
yeah? Is she coming home soon?
uh, two weeks. There's no infection.
infection's a killer with this type of wound.
she can't get an infection.
she's pretty alert, though?
she's Lucy. She's very alert.
all right.
Spiller? - Yeah.
animal therapy. Hug a pet.
is that a bearded collie?
it sure is. Would you like to say hello?
Yeah. Hi. What's his name?
it's Bugsy. - Hi, Bugsy.
Hi, baby.
so how'd you know?
nobody ever guesses the breed.
because I used to have one when I was in high school.
best dog I ever had.
spiller. Are you Lucy Spiller?
Yeah, I am.
Oh, my God.
what a-- just a terrible story.
you should see the other guy.
man, she just, um, went crazy, huh?
I guess so.
is it just because you wrote that article about her?
the dog looks pretty thirsty.
Oh, no, she's fine.
wow, that's pretty good.
you're the only reporter who's made it into the room.
wha? Ah, no.
miles, let's give the police department a call, okay?
or I could deal with him.
no. Look, you're right.
but I'm not a tabloid reporter.
I work for the L. A. Weekly. My name is Farber Kaufman.
I'm a freelancer, okay?
I just graduated from Columbia Journalism four months ago.
please.
why would the pretentious snobs who read the Weekly care what goes on in a tabloid?
I pitched it as this kind of cultural endgame story.
tabloid culture killed Julia Mallory, but not before she tried to kill the tabloid queen.
you know, that sort of thing.
first of all, yawn.
and the murder attempt, it seemed personal, almost sexual.
why did she go to your house, get inside, and stab you repeatedly?
I mean, that's the kind of violent action that one takes against their intimate.
that's interesting if that were true.
but crazy people imagine they know you better than they do.
you're the one who wrote the piece on the Russian mafia last month.
that was good.
what do you say I triple whatever you're making and put you on staff?
you want me to dig through Lindsay Lohan's garbage for a living?
Oh, come on, give it a shot.
if you don't like it, walk away.
or Miles can give you a lift to booking.
hmm.
you're getting so big, buddy, there's hardly room for both of us in the bed anymore.
huh? Is there?
hey?
huh?
you know what normal means, Don?
it means your cat doesn't talk to you.
I guess you're right, but
good-bye, Don.
good-bye, Buddy.
wow, you just get bigger.
I feel like shit.
did you give Barrow the changes?
Yeah. Could I have your pudding?
no, honey, I love the pudding.
you can have the applesauce.
okay. - Let me see the sales numbers.
I told Barrow he should bring these over himself.
no one wanted to tell you.
what's Icon?
we probably should've lied.
what is Icon Magazine? You need to rest, Lucy.
no, what the hell is Icon Magazine?
is that the cover? - Yeah.
I don't think Barrow really incorporated
please, give it to me. Give it-- Ow.
don. - no - Give it to me. - No!
Lucy, you shouldn't. She shouldn't.
you shouldn't be doing this, trying to run a magazine out of a hospital bedroom, you know?
you almost died!
and they said that I should be prepared for the worst.
you know, she could die, your friend could die.
or slip into a permanent persistent vegetative state, and then eventually you would have to pull the plug because there's no point in going on when people, and their
don! - Woo! Woo! Woo!
here. Let me have it.
it's okay.
it's okay.
I'm okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you can have my pudding.
Thanks.
thank you.
??
you've got to be kidding me.
Oh, Christ! My frickin' water broke.
great.
wipe it up with that.
I just don't know what they were thinking.
miss Spiller? Miss Spiller?
first of all, you should be in a wheelchair.
Yeah, you should be in this hospital for at least another week.
miss Spiller, this is not just hospital rules.
if you walk out of here, you could risk infection
listen, if I can survive whatever's lurking in Don's car,
I can survive anything.
Hi.
Hello, everyone. Vacation's over.
Hey, Brent.
spiller. You're-- - Alive.
well, yeah.
I thought you were out for another couple of weeks.
are you back for good?
looks like it.
Oh, thank God.
I humbly relinquish my throne.
I would like to say, everybody, this has been the most humbling experience of my life.
me, too.
Really? More than that whole underage sex thing?
well-- - Yeah.
all right, we'll save the tears and the group hugs for later.
right now, we have a magazine to rescue.
Oh, and this is Farber Kaufman, he's a staff reporter who will be gunning for all of your jobs.
Hey.
I mean, really? That's what you came up with?
after my notes and after the last two Julia Mallory covers tanked?
well, they didn't tank.
they got beat. - Yeah, here.
let me see it.
well, they've just ripped off our design and did a better cover.
I mean, look at it. It's great.
they found a publicity shot of Julia Mallory holding a knife.
where the hell was my photo department?
wow, this is pathetic.
this story just dropped in our laps
in my gut-- and this is the best
the best you can do?
okay, we need to move on.
is that clear?
we need to find a new story where we define the curve.
hello. Is this thing on?
Oh, God. Um, well, we could do a Julia Mallory cover with
with... a reenactment.
you know, we could do it with photos.
it's so much worse than I thought.
uh, Lucy, should I just be following you
that one's yours. - Okay.
excuse me. That is my desk. - I know.
Oh. Well.
this is bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
has Martina Linn had her baby yet?
no, she's still in the hospital on bed rest.
why is she on bed rest? To try to keep her away from the Mai tais?
it's true. God does write the best soap operas.
farber, you know this story? Yeah. A little.
catch him up.
all righty, then.
chapter 1:
cheap gold digger Martina Linn, stripper slash model, marries 68-year-old Ukrainian oil tycoon.
he gets poisoned by the Russian Mob
uh, the prince dies, the princess cries, and she inherits a lot of money.
right. Exactly. So chapter 2:
his mob buddies say that it's their money, so she hires Keith Straub, sleazy lawyer guy, who says that he can get the money back from the Russians without getting her killed
and let me guess. They fall in love.
Yeah. He's having a kid with her so that he makes sure that he's tied to her 300 mill.
so everyone's gonna cover this as gold digger makes good.
but she is more than that.
when the nuclear blast hits, it's just gonna be her and the cockroaches.
right. So chapter 3 is the baby.
now, when this baby drops, you better own this story.
and have my office painted. I've seen enough red.
Willa, you have anything yet?
since three minutes ago? - All right.
go talk to her. She's never met a reporter she didn't like.
okay. Oh, um, Lucy? - What?
I just wanted to tell you something. Um... - What?
when I first started working here, I thought that I could do your job, that I could just sort of be you.
Mm-hmm. You know? But, um, when you were in the hospital,
I had a chance to take on as much of the responsibility for this magazine as I ever dreamed, and
and what?
well, I just-- I couldn't do it.
I mean, I can dress like you, I can act like you, but it's gonna take a long time before I can run a magazine like you.
that's sweet.
did you rehearse that?
Yeah.
Hey, Don.
Hey, Lucy.
are you done yet?
no, I'm still here in Dr. Shalba's office.
okay, I'll be right there.
no.
you don't have to. I'm okay.
don, I'm on my way. - I'm-- I'm good.
all right. Bye. - Bye.
Oh. Willa.
Hi. Keith Straub.
Hi. - How are you? Good to see you.
this is Chad. I'm the son that doesn't matter.
okay. Kids, huh? - Yeah.
and this, of course, is the stunning Martina Linn.
shut up, Keith. I look like a whale.
I can't wait for my C-section.
so nice to meet you all.
thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me.
Lucy wanted to be here in person, but she's just out of the hospital herself, so
Oh, no problem, sweetie. We're just thrilled that you're interested in the baby pictures.
all the magazines are interested. The more, the merrier.
well, Lucy wants to do a cover.
uh, a whole issue, really, about how love triumphs over tragedy and adversity.
that's sweet.
Yeah. Um...
are there any wedding bells in your future?
Oh-ho. No, no, no, no.
I've been married twice before, and both times it was a disaster.
I love Keith way too much to put that curse on him.
this baby is our bond of love. You can quote us on that.
do you know that he got me my inheritance without me - ending up in the dumpster? - Wow.
he is my savior and my true love.
that's another good quote. - Mmm. Mm- hmm.
speaking of the story, let's get back to the baby pictures.
so, we're at 750 for the exclusive set right now.
Wow. That's pretty high.
no shit.
Chaddy, would you go get me a soda?
Yes, Mama.
right away, Mama. Anything for you, Mama.
um, it was really nice to meet you, Chad.
Oh. Yeah. You, too. Yeah.
Hi, Don. - Hi, Dr. Shalba.
how are you feeling today, Don? - Weird.
weird how?
well, I-- -- I say weird because I'm starting to feel normal and I haven't felt normal for a long time, and it feels weird.
well, we'll keep an eye on those feelings of normalcy.
they can be pretty scary, huh? - Yeah.
schizophrenia serves a purpose for people who suffer from it.
the hallucinations, the flights of psychosis actually help lessen the pain and intensity of everyday experience.
do you follow? - I do.
but I think it's great that we're trying this.
okay.
I'm going to give you the shot now, all right?
Hahh!
and we'll make sure your "normal
doesn't get too weird.
all right. - Dr. Shalba?
Yes, Don. - Those African masks, they never really spoke, did they?
no, Don, they never spoke.
I'll see you in a couple of weeks, okay?
Wow.
Hey, come here! You ungrateful bitch!
holy shit.
is this the thanks that I get?
don, is that Sharlee Cates?
who? - Sharlee Cates.
Oh, yeah. Get your camera out.
okay. - Hurry.
okay, I'm hurrying.
you gotta get this shot.
what's on her face?
What'd she have to do there? - No.
no. No good. - No good?
I'm sorry.
Sharlee Cates would be a great get now.
whoa. Please, Lucy, Lucy.
Lucy, please.
get it, Don!
what are you doing? I'll kill you!
friggin' move!
get away!
move! You friggin' paparazzi piece of shit!
I'll hit you! Move!
piece of shit!
you're crazy.
Oh, shit.
I popped a staple.
no.
it's okay.
that was great.
I'm gonna say another week of bed rest at the very minimum.
all right.
doctor, Carla is freaking in radiology.
you need to get up there.
Why? What is Carla's problem?
all I know is that she is shouting your name like she was on fire.
you want to finish dressing this?
you're the magazine lady, Lucy Spiller?
I am.
you guys buy stories, right?
depends.
well, nobody's got this one.
martina Linn's son Chad is in the hospital.
how am I doing?
don? You got cash?
underpants.
go on.
my friend at Saint Edmonds said it was a massive overdose.
dead?
coma.
she's a tragedy magnet, that one.
chapter 3.
it's Chad Linn.
tell Lucy Spiller I got the real story for her
about the old man, murder, sex, betrayal, everything.
but I wanna get paid good.
hit me back, blondie.
when did this come in?
about an hour before they said he OD'd.
I thought he was clean.
Yeah, apparently not so much.
what is this real story he's talking about?
do I need to call this into the LAPD?
so they can screw it up?
no.
don's on the hospital. Let's see what happens.
all right, I gave the foreigners 500 bucks so that should keep everybody out while I talk to Martina.
give her a grand. - What for?
cause we need her. Tell her it's a down payment.
all right.
see what you can find out about Sharlee Cates and this broad.
these are great. - Thank you.
I got the pictures of the kid in a coma.
and I got a copy of his medical chart.
said he OD'd on methadone.
methadone?
what addict accidentally overdoses on methadone?
they're calling it a suicide.
hmm.
something's not right.
you don't call wanting a payday when you are planning to kill yourself.
Ow. - Ah.
Ooh, easy.
it's okay.
I guess somebody, you know, knew he would talk and messed with his dosage.
looks like we got chapter 4.
it's great, Don. You feeling good?
no.
but I'm feeling normal.
Willa. Hi. Wake up.
I need you to get every bit of audio you can find on Chad Linn.
get our Web guy to help you out.
okay. I need it by tomorrow. Thanks.
you need to rest.
getting it done? - Ooh!
Oh, yeah. Um
Yeah, we're getting there slowly.
young Chad wasn't the most articulate guy in town.
neither is the mom.
Oh, she had her baby.
Really? - Yeah.
8 pounds, 11 ounces.
baby Lindee. C-section.
if it takes after the mom, 4 of the 8 pounds are tits.
is she photo-friendly?
Yeah. Total Gerber baby, apparently.
Oh, great.
all right, tell Photo to go up to 850.
I want you to pay that nurse another 5 grand,
get something from the baby.
I want a diaper, a hair, an ear.
take it to Gateway Labs. - Okay.
Oh, um, uh, Lucy, there's a guy
hello. Hi, Miss Spiller.
it's great to meet you.
I was sent over by Media Helpers.
I think Claudia at HR spoke to you about - the assistant job. - Oh, right...Yeah...
okay. There you go.
okay. Good.
you went to college. - Yes.
you're a big guy. I like that.
makes me feel safe.
Oh, great. That's great.
Yeah, listen-- I'm sorry to hear about your recent troubles.
if there's anything that I can do to make things easier around here
you know I'm a crazy bitch, right?
uh, yes, I have heard that you can be
that it can be a bit of a challenge, but I'm certainly ready to meet that challenge
okay. That's fantastic. Here.
you can start right now. - Fantastic. Yes, great.
thank you. I wasn't really planning-- But yes
thank you. - Wait, your name is Kenny?
Yes. Is that a problem?
well, it was for the last guy.
what happened to the last guy?
he got shot in the head.
okay.
Ah...
harsh.
what? - Harsh.
I know, I know. Harsh.
what are you doing? - Harsh.
I'm gonna leave. I just need a second.
I just need a second. Harsh.
I know, I know, I know.
harsh.
okay.
okay, I'm good.
um, I'm sorry.
I just-- I have this condition and, um
I don't want to bore you with it, but this is the only thing that helps.
it's self-soothing.
otherwise, I faint.
so I'm gonna go. Thank you so much for your time.
I think you should stay. This could be fun.
Oh, excellent.
Yes. Yes. I think that it could be fun.
and really, when you think about it
but you gotta minimize the chatter.
right. I'm sorry.
I get nervous. Um, that's
Oh, okay. Thank you.
okay. Oh, watch out for anthrax.
Oh.
harsh.
so the lady Sharlee Cates was chasing was the mother of her assistant Joanne Wentzel.
Ex-assistant, rather.
Sharlee was chasing her ex-assistant's mother?
apparently.
well, it's a dazzling story. Why?
the mother Joanne works at a dermatologist's office.
bad Botox?
Sharlee Cates is 22, genius.
so I looked up your information, which we're not supposed to do unless we're running a check for employers, but I do it all the time:
new girlfriends, landlords, whatever.
plus this thing kicks ass over Google, so
had a bit of a gambling problem in college, huh?
Yeah, it's a bummer.
uneven employment history, and you work for DirtNow.
now.
you know, it always terrifies me how much information potential employers have access to.
I know. It's crazy.
Hey, how's it going, Emily?
Yeah, I like how the piping is fitting with the-- the-- the slacks.
is that a-- That's a choice.
five DUIs, two kids.
bikes to work. It's a sad story.
I don't know how she does it.
did you find anything out about Heather Wentzel, the assistant?
uh, why, is this some kind of big
Sharlee Cates scandal coming down?
all depends on you, Lars.
then you're shit out of luck. Heather's Wentzel's boring.
no arrests, and the Sharlee Cates gig was her first assistant job, so
what about the mom?
Yeah. She almost got fired because her employer, Alpha Pharmaceuticals, accused her of stealing quantities of prescription drugs to sell to her clients.
turns out they couldn't prove anything 'cause the file was closed.
but it wasn't closed to us 'cause the mighty corporation sees all
oh-ooh.
I'm starting to see how all this comes together.
it's cool. Reporting.
so am I gonna be in DirtNow?
well, wouldn't you get fired?
yeah... I guess.
can I be an anonymous source?
no problem.
Hey, the mother, Joanne Wentzel, was Sharlee's dealer, okay?
got her daughter Heather hired as Sharlee's assistant.
but when Joanne gets busted and stops getting Vicodin and Oxy for Sharlee,
Sharlee freaked, okay?
I'm basically two calls away from having it locked up and double-sourced.
Wow. Not bad, Woodward.
I know. Right?
so Sharlee Cates is a drug user.
could be.
no, no, no, no. For sure, okay?
I confirmed with Heather, the assistant she fired, and I got the secondary source.
it's gonna pass Legal for sure.
all right, well, it's interesting.
I'll definitely consider it. Thanks.
that's it?
your writing could use some work.
Willa, give it a pass. Dirt it up a little.
uh, do you mean dumb it down?
okay, let's see.
she's the apotheosis of bubble gum pop.
you're kidding, right?
any word on Chad Linn?
no. Still coma boy, but I did get a tape for you.
did your nurse come through? - I got a hair.
great. I want a lab report as soon as possible.
I don't care what it costs.
Chad wants to sell us the story.
he says you tried to kill him.
Chaddie's awake?
I'm going to make you a deal.
I'll tell your story.
you could use the pages of Dirt to sway the jury.
that's bullshit. I just saw him this morning.
Ted Williams' head has a better chance of waking up.
sorry, baby.
well, he was up enough to ask the nurse to switch him to a more secure room.
you can ask the ICU.
you're full of shit.
let's see.
Lucy, it's Chad Linn.
I got a real story, but I want to get paid.
martina tried to make me die, just like she poisoned the old man.
What'd you do, load his Diet Coke with methadone?
I-- - Don't say anything.
I don't know why you keep sticking up for her.
she screwed you, too.
okay, I think it's time you get the hell out of here.
fine, but if it were me, and my baby girl was another man's,
I'd want to know.
that's bullshit.
go.
here you go.
this is baby Lindee's DNA.
there's a match to a very large
russian family, the Romanovs.
isn't that the name of your late husband?
Keith, you're not the father.
she's not going to marry you. You're not going to get a dime.
Keith, honey, honestly, I would never ever
don't, don't, don't.
do not bullshit me.
so when were you going to get around to killing me?
that's so mean.
why would you say something so hurtful?
spare me the theatrics, okay?
this isn't one of your soft-porn movies.
you poisoned your husband, you poisoned your child.
it stands to reason that I'm next.
you can't let me live, can you? I know where the bodies are.
Keith, honey, really, it's just our word against hers.
it don't mean nothing.
what about me, Martina?
what do I get?
just-- Just anything you want.
just draw up the papers. I'll sign it.
I love you.
and you still love me.
what are you going to do?
I'm going to give away half my money as soon as he gets bored?
like they all eventually do?
if you say so.
you got no story here, you know?
Really? - No.
how so?
well, he's not going to talk because he'd implicate himself.
and even if Chaddie does come out of his coma, well, he's a career addict.
breaks my heart.
with a criminal history? Pssh.
he's not a very reliable witness.
Yeah, well, I'm not a D. A.
I'm a reporter.
and I'm pretty certain that I can report your confession in this interview.
Yeah, well, knock yourself out.
really.
because I didn't say any of that.
Oh. - You know Phil Spector?
he killed that woman, shot her dead, confessed at the crime scene.
and what happened to him?
and I have more money than him and Robert Blake and O. J. combined.
uh, Ms. Spiller, Sharlee Cates is here.
she's-- - Move, asswipe.
harsh. Ugh.
I have a kid and a marriage, you know?
I will sue.
it all went through Legal. They're pretty confident.
but I'm not going to run it.
what?
I want you to meet someone.
this is Don Konkey.
Hi, Sharlee.
sounds like Donkey Kong.
Yeah, it's almost an anagram.
but there's no G in Don Konkey.
don's going to be your personal photographer.
he'll need unfettered access.
Oh, that means lots.
I really like "Love Me Monday.
thank you.
I mean, why have one sad career-destroying cover when we can have 20 happy, productive ones?
I knew Julia Mallory.
not like best friends, but I knew her.
doesn't it make you nervous to mess around with people's lives like this?
given everything that's happened.
no.
well...
my fans don't want to see me as a druggy, so, um...
give me a call, Donkey Kong.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Yeah, that'll be good.
that's a $12, 000 rug.
I hope she's worth it.
don't sweat it, dude.
mm, thank you, dude.
you get that that story was just a prop for Lucy to use with Sharlee and with you?
it still doesn't excuse some of your larger sins of metaphor and syntax in this piece.
Oh, goody.
journalism class. Go ahead.
last May at the Coliseum, Sharlee Cates "literally ripped the hearts out of the audience with her rendition of 'Hey, Jude.'
help me out here, Willa.
what did she do, exactly?
did she descend into the crowd while singing and start tearing out their still-beating hearts like some kind of Mayan priest at a ritual sacrifice?
I mean, I'm assuming you were a journalism major or at least an English major.
Jesus Christ, what do you do?
just come to work here and throw out every trace of education and ethics you ever acquired?
you wouldn't happen to be talking about yourself just a
just a little bit, would you?
whatever.
he died a year ago on the night of a blood moon, also known as a sanguine moon.
that's tonight.
a year ago.
I remember.
Tristan was special.
there was no way he was going to a pet cemetery.
ramon...
caretaker here, he understands that.
and I give him a hundred a month on the side.
I didn't like the way you drove when we were chasing Sharlee.
Mm. I'm sorry.
part of my, uh, being normal is risk aversion.
I'm developing my risk aversion.
I'm developing my risk.
Yeah, fear is an essential survival tool.
Yeah, but fear can also do you in.
I'm over it.
what happened to you, Lucy?
I was in a coma, and for a minute I crossed over.
it was so nice.
why'd you come back?
I don't know.
we'll see.
don't drive like that when I'm in the car.
okay?
okay.
what happened to you?
since I've been sick, it's been like looking at one of those old funhouse mirrors.
and then, one day I turn around and I see the whole real world.
and my cat stopped talking to me.
my walls stopped breathing.
and instead of seeing the moon in my mind,
I'm really here.
I am, right?
we both are.
pretty, huh?
he's not the right one.
I want to see you.
I thought that maybe we could do the press room together.
Oh, don't take this the wrong way, Sharlee, but we're-- we're-- we're done here.
you've built an empire on nothing.
you're welcome.
don, I need this.
Sharlee and Mia, that is it.
I'm sorry, Lucy, you know, there's nothing there.
give me the recorder. Hmm.
don, give it to me.
she is not a person, she is a product.
Oh, Don.
I figured that, after we slept together, the least I could do is give you my personal e-mail address.
a little something for all your efforts tonight.
one of my assistants just dropped in the room.
all right!
Lucy, it's your mother.
Paul's birthday is coming up.
I'm going in for another touch-up this morning, but I want the surgery to be his surprise
you know, his little present.
I'll be away for a few days, and I'll be in a lot of pain, which should make you very happy.
okay. Well, I gotta go.
Eduardo, my Kundalini yoga master, is here.
and just so you know,
I was younger than you when I got my first touch-up.
you should think about it.
Hello?
holy shit.
he looks like a very large Smurf.
uh, that can happen when someone continues to breathe with little or no oxygen entering the lungs.
okay, well, then, what's with the, um
erection? - Mm-hmm.
suffocating must have really, really excited your friend sexually.
then I positively say that that is Brent Barrow.
good morning, Lucy.
gather everybody in the bullpen. - Okay.
Hey, uh, Perri Tatum, former sitcom queen, - Trim N' Fit spokesperson-- - Love her. Go.
according to my source at the ad agency that handles Trim N' Fit
Oh, this sucks.
the copy, not your idea. Go ahead.
well, she supposed to shoot her quarterly weight loss photos, the only problem is that she's packed on about 30 of the 80 pounds she lost.
Oh, loving it more. What's the story?
her people have contacted a handful of doctors you know, so it'll appear the diet's working.
the problem is, Perri has a heart condition that ups her chances of dying in surgery to, like, one in a hundred.
so every doctor has turned her down, except for this one surgeon up in Ojai who's willing to do the surgery if she signs a waiver.
God, I love stupid celebrities.
just makes my life so much easier.
that's really good work. Don't screw it up with your Harvard words.
okay, everyone. Our publisher, - Brent Barrow, is dead. - What?
Yes.
he passed out in his garage while his car was running, and died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
there's a service on Thursday.
Kenny will e-mail you the details.
you're all expected to attend, even those of you who couldn't stand him, and we all know who we are.
he literally partied himself to death.
and you could really see it sticking up through the body bag?
Yes. Yes. It was horrible.
Oh, that's too bad, because if he had ever done anything else of note in his life, he'd be my next cover.
so why is this bugging you so much?
I don't know.
poor thing, he just tried so hard.
it was pathetic.
I mean, the guy died trying to fit in.
you know what?
when I first moved to Hollywood, someone told me to be careful what you ask for, because you just might get it.
I think he got what he asked for.
I don't think you have to be careful what you ask for, you just have to be very specific.
Oh, really? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah, okay. - What?
what are you thinking?
just thinking about how beautiful you are.
I'm sorry I'm obsessing on this.
I should be obsessing about the fact you're gonna do a movie with Claire Leland, the black widow.
well, she does want me, and she-- she's gonna seduce me, so
I'm sure she's gonna try. What are you gonna do?
Hey, take it easy.
I've been over the edge. I'm not going back.
Oh, yeah?
besides, I already have one woman I can't handle.
what the hell am I gonna do with another one?
so you gonna keep talking...
or are you gonna give me a reason not to succumb to Claire Leland's little evil seduction?
God, you're such a little shit.
hi here. Come here. - No.
I swear, I won't do anything. I swear. It'd be good. I know.
wouldn't it be good? Too bad.
Oh, yeah. I got it.
no, I think that's mine.
Oh, my God. You kick me in the face.
your feet smell terrible.
it's mine. Farber.
Yeah. Right now? Right.
Jesus, well, yeah, I mean, you know, of course.
give me a second.
what?
I hate to do this, but, um, I have to leave.
where?
just help a friend.
he's, uh-- He's in trouble.
car trouble? Girlfriend trouble?
the kind of trouble with red flashing lights and a siren.
What'd he get busted for?
it's totally stupid.
that's it?
you're not even gonna tell me what this is really about?
I just did. It's totally stupid.
okay. - What?
you don't believe me? - No, I
no, no, no, I-- I believe you.
Yes. It's just...
nothing. Forget it. Just go. It's fine.
Um...if you're gonna snoop, which I guarantee that you're going to now, you're not gonna find much.
so knock yourself out.
thanks for bailing me out, man. - Yeah, yeah.
I'm kind of surprised you called me.
other than playing poker?
Yeah, well, no one else is around.
it's, like, party weekend, so...
Ah. - ...they're all down in Palm Springs.
uh...
actually, there's a reason I called you.
you work for Dirt.
what, you want me to write about this?
wait, wait, here-- How's a title?
uh, former teen heartthrob busted barebacking bartender in bathroom.
come on. It was just a blowjob, for Christ's sake.
I mean, what do the cops think goes on in a place called the Iron Fist anyway?
how much trouble am I in, man?
I mean, is this gonna get out?
well, yeah.
I mean, there's a police report.
Yeah, but not under my stage name.
you gotta help bury this, man.
keep it out of Dirt. I just landed this role.
since the series ended.
it's funded by this Christian group that doesn't even know I'm gay.
if this gets out, I'm out.
I am flat broke, Farber.
I seriously need this paycheck.
I do what I can.
okay. Once this paycheck comes in
screw these right-wingers or those 12-year-old girls that ever had a crush on me
I will come out in Dirt.
your story. Exclusive.
okay? Probably I'll get a parade - out of this or something. - All right, well.
stupid reality show.
as soon as the check clears, man.
because, if my boss finds out about this,
I'm gonna be the one bending over and grabbing my ankles.
Where'you learn to eat, a barn?
I'm sorry.
it's like a thousand degrees hot.
I don't know why they serve it this way.
I usually have better manners-- table manners.
my brother, Jason-- - You know, it's okay.
it's-- It's-- Just slurp softer.
okay. I am sorry. - I said it's okay.
no, about this.
what are you-- Oh, my God!
you people have no boundaries! Stop it!
gee.
Lucy Spiller from Dirt Now magazine, she knows about your surgery.
you go in for the lipo, she's gonna write about it.
that is none of her business.
as our Lord and vior,
God's son, said on the cross, it is finished.
so our Lord will welcome Brent Barrow into Heaven.
and Brent Barrow is now feasting at God's table.
and we must feel a joy for Brent because there will come a day when we all will be feasting at God's table with him.
now, if any of Brent's friends, family, or colleagues wish to say a few words,
I encourage you to please stand and speak from your heart.
are you off your medication?
astute.
daring.
ambitious.
okay. So, kinda figured that you owed me for the other night.
Jesus, here? Yes.
a step ahead in a world where most people are two steps behind.
many people find these qualities abrasive, but I found in Brent a kindred spirit.
let God be his judge!
because if I hear of anyone under my employ making judgments, you will be terminated.
Adieu, Brent Barro
I will miss you, my friend.
you know, if I thought he wouldn't throw up on the rug,
I'd invite him over for dinner.
I'd invite him anyway.
if you don't mind me watching...
Oh, God! - Keep going.
you won't be the first ones.
Jesus.
Yeah. Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, Lucy, your brother's been on hold for 30 minutes.
he says it's urgent.
Kenny, you'll learn that my brother's entire life is urgent.
unfortunately, none of it ever turns out to be very important.
okay.
yeah?
there was a problem with Mom's plastic surgery.
she died.
so, was it important?
Yes, it was.
mother's dead.
Oh. I'm sorry.
well, what about if I can sleep over, you know?
I'll call Jason and-- He won't mind.
I'm okay, sweetie. Thank you.
I'm fine.
okay, I'm not.
Death...I know it.
it's guaranteed, I understand that.
but why does it seem that everybody is oblivious to the fact that they're swimming in deep water until they drown?
because we're stupid.
we all do stupid things, Lucy.
I have, you have.
we just don't think they're gonna kill us.
you know, um, about the Sharlee tape, - I'm-- I'm sorry. - It's okay.
well, it's not okay, it's just that, uh,
I'm glad to see that you're healthy enough to stand up to me.
all right, I'm on duty.
if you need me, you... - Thank you.
Hey, your story on that singer and her extreme sport boyfriend?
all true according to TMZ.
they have a video of some stripper giving him a pretty racy lap dance.
that's perfect.
see if we can get some stills for the article.
detective Ortiz?
Hi. It's Willa McPherson.
did you like the champagne?
great! Listen, I'm trying to track an arrest sheet for a Mitchell Bianchi, very early Wednesday morning.
Yeah, still the same fax number.
Hey.
how's the going?
Lucy, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom.
I'm kinda sorry that I had to hear it from my publicist.
I'm sorry, I
you're working and I just
I didn't want to bother you.
come on, Lucy, you can't bullshit me.
all right, um, Holt,
I don't want to talk about this, okay?
let me just get through the next couple of days.
all right. Well, I'm gonna come back to LA as soon as we wrap tonight, all right?
so-- - No!
this is not the way I want people to find out about us.
Hello?
I'm here.
all right, I don't need you angry with me right now.
not over this
let me just figure this out on my own.
well...
you know what most people do?
they lean on each other.
it's called being in a relationship.
well, you're not most people, Holt.
I don't even think I am anymore. So, um...
let me just deal here and you focus on making a great movie.
I don' function well inside this box, Lucy.
I know.
I'll call you, okay? Bye.
holy shit!
I used to kiss your poster every night.
giving oral assistance to another male in a public restroom?
I guess my fantasy of us having a big wedding and lots of babies is certainly not happening.
so, these are some of Mom's favorite outfits and she loved yellow roses, an arrangement from you and me.
uh, her favorite outfits and yellow roses. I'm here.
paul wrote a poem for the memorial.
a poem? - Six verses.
you gotta say something for the senior shack-up.
do you want to say anything at the memorial?
no.
I've said enough.
she loved you.
that wasn't the issue.
we didn't like each other.
hmm? - Nah, I'll go with the heels.
what am I saying? She's in a box.
I just wish there was something we could've done to stop her.
Leo, plastic surgery was her opiate.
no one could have stopped her.
you know, the one thing I know Mom would have wanted was to look great in her casket to make her friends envious.
but with the botched surgery...
what's for lunch, Perri?
I'd like to eat in peace, guys.
come on. What's on the menu?
a turkey hot dog.
okay? It's on my diet for Christ's sakes. Come on!
I like it, I like it.
come on, Perri. Come on, Perri.
come on, hon. Give us a show, give us a show.
come on, get up!
show us what you got! All right! Here we go!
I am fat!
okay? So what?
Yeah! I like it!
is this what you want? You want me to go...
my fat ass! Okay? Oh, how about these?
big titties! That turn you boys on, huh?
don't wanna miss my belly! Come on ?
you know what? Now it's my turn to shoot!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. What did I do?
you just became the patron saint of celebrities.
after placing the implants, we will enlarge both aureoles, making sure that they're symmetrical.
excuse me, I'm in the middle of a consultation.
your tits are fine.
uh, could you wait outside?
who are you? I'm Lucy Spiller.
you killed my mother. - I didn't kill her.
she had internal bleedin from scar tissue.
scar tissue from too many surgeries.
surgeries you performed, doctor.
I'm calling the police.
Yeah, well, you ought to call your lawyer.
you can't-- I can.
and the ensuing article will not only cover the three people who died from your surgeries over the last 17 years, but also how you're a devoted family man and an elder at your Hillcrest Presbyterian Church while you keep a junkie mistress in the Marina.
I'm sorry about your mother, but I could not have known.
I haven't even gotten to the best part.
what's this? - This is your patient list.
it's a who's who and the surgeries they've had done.
Wow. It's gonna make for great copy, isn't it?
I mean, it's gonna kill your business, but, man, am I gonna sell some magazines!
what do you want?
free plastic surgery? For life?
Hello? You just killed my mother!
can you believe this guy? - Unbelievable.
Dr. Sandburn, if you want to keep off the cover of my magazine, you're going to make my mother look better in death than she ever did in life.
I'm not a mortician. - You're right, you're better.
so cancel your Botox and your butt lifts for the next couple of days, because my mother's memorial is Friday and it's open-casket.
Oh, and by the way, from now on you're going to be my go-to guy for stars and they have done.
Yeah. - I'll call you.
Leo, be a man. Punch him.
sorry.
Hey, Sharlee, what'd you buy?
just some stuff for the baby.
move! You guys, please move. Hi, Don.
get out of my face!
freakin' move!
it's okay, baby Romy.
we're gonna get home in a second.
okay.
come on, Sharlee.
Hey, your stroller, sweet cheeks!
stroller! Sharlee, come on! Stay with us, Sharlee.
shit!
stupid door!
Hey, Sharlee, the car's rolling.
the door's locked!
Romy! - Mom
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
move!
can you open the door?
help me! Romy!
Romy! Oh, God.
Romy! Can you help me?
Romy! Oh, my God! Somebody please help!
Oh, my God. Oh!
stop! Romy!
are you okay?
are you okay?
thank you Don.
I'm sorry I didn't get the shot, Lucy, but the truck was rolling down.
and the baby was crying.
don, you did a great thing, seriously.
I mean, just don't ever let it happen again.
Hey, there you are!
okay, I just got this from my source at the emergency call center.
it's gold.
9-1-1 emergency operator. Name and location, please?
714 Sky View Drive, in the Palisades.
I need an ambulance!
what seems to be the problem, ma'am?
I was trying to do this colonic and now I'm lying here in...shit!
I just can't get this tube out of... Just get me a goddamn ambulance!
Un-shittin'-believable!
and I mean that literay.
the woman hates herself so much, she tore herself a new asshole.
go get a picture of Perri in the hospital.
you go with him. Get her side of the story.
what are you, a Bobble Head? Go!
Hi, Carol. This is Lucy Spiller.
I need some shots of Sharlee from the grocery store today.
Yes, the ones that everyone wants.
Yeah. Did you also get some of Don sing that kid?
okay, great. Throw those in, too.
Yeah, it's a nice thing he did. I want to give him a gift.
okay. Thank you.
hello. - Hi.
how'd you get in here? - It's my job.
before you do that, Miss Tatum, we have a copy of your call to 9-1-1.
okay? But listen.
dirt Now Magazine wants your side of the story, exclusively.
you run that 9-1-1 call, people are gonna think I have shit for brains.
not after hearing the tape.
they won't think you had an ounce of shit in your much less brain.
you parasites like kicking people when they're down.
we're offering you an opportunity to kick back, if you'll take it.
I've seen Lucy Spiller.
what's she weight?
about a hundred pounds wet?
give or take.
you tell her she screws me over.
I will hunt her ass down and I will crush her like a grape.
I'll happily pass along the message.
so you'll talk?
ask.
not stopping me from having to pee.
you know, the ex teen star of My Dad's the Maid?
he just got busted having oral in the bathroom of a gay bar.
cause that's never happened.
unless he was blowing a senator, who cares?
he just got the lead in God's Warrior, a movie being produced by Evangelical Films.
you know, the Christian movie company?
I like the irony, but still...
Oh, could you just read it?
now? - Yeah.
well, don't come with me. We're not girlfriends.
all right. I'll run it.
in the back of the book.
figures.
wait for me...my love
wait for me...
until we finally mate celestially.
we'll make heaven as hot as hell might wish to be.
and when we then embrace, our spirits free, we'll blend and mix and merge ephemerally.
and then at last we'll know, sweet Dorothy, the meaning of eternal ecstasy.
I hope he's next.
I should...talk to Paul.
I'm sorry.
you didn't have to come.
I love you, Luce, and I don't mind dead people.
Lucy. Your mother was a wonderful woman.
generous with her time and talents.
and such a blithe spirit. - Thank you.
one question, darling. - Who did your mother?
we all agree, she looks 10 years younger.
she died on his table.
Oh! Oh, it's tragic. Really.
but, if she had to go, at least she went looking her best.
I can't believe I was raised by such a selfish woman.
I just-- I resent that. I really resent it!
she just had so many insecurities.
well, we all have insecurities, Luce.
but, Don, hers killed her.
she-- Okay.
you know, I always thought that one day
I would have the chance to become friends with her, to make some sort of peace.
and now you can't do that.
I know.
Yeah, we all need someone who's got our back.
thank God I have you.
always, Luce.
and I have you.
but you need someone other than me you can share your life with.
you have somebody in mind?
see? See, I like it when you smile.
makes me believe that everything's gonna be all right.
well, I also smile when I want to rip somebody's head off.
Yeah, but I believe everything's good when you do that too.
you're sweet.
Hey, this is Holt. Leave me a message.
Hi.
I was just, um, wanting to call you.
okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye.
Oh, Don.
so sweet.
I gotta thank you.
I just learned a valuable lesson in who to trust!
you would've done the same thing. - No!
I would not have done the same thing.
if I had known you were going to bail out your little gay friend, I wouldn't have.
what's the big secret anyway? I mean, next time try honesty.
you didn't just say that.
look, I've been with guys that keep secrets from me, and it always ends up in one place:
me getting screwed over. - Yeah, well, now you know why.
this runs now, and it's worth nothing, okay?
Mitch'll get dumped from the movie and then he's a non-story.
well, he should've worried about that before he knobbed some bartender in a toilet.
all I'm asking is that you wait and then he's gonna come out in the magazine.
I mean, that is a cover.
it stings getting scooped by your girlfriend, doesn't it?
Willa stole this story by sticking a knife in my back.
well, take it out and get back to work.
trust me, knife wounds heal.
Yes.
but how much in Euros are we talking?
twenty-two million? Close it.
sorry.
buying a place next to Clooney in Italy.
I don't mean to take you away from your busy day.
I wanted to tell you how sorry I am about your mother.
well, you sent flowers.
I did? - Mm-hmm.
Oh. Well, I wanted you to hear it from my lips.
thank you.
while I was at Brent's selecting some things I'd left there,
I discovered a collection of homemade sex tapes.
Oh. You know, it doesn't surprise me.
granted, his system isn't as sophisticated as mine.
I have a multi-camera system in my bedroom.
the quality of Brent's is crude, slyly effective.
okay. And?
I didn't view it. Out of respect.
respect? You don't believe me?
no. I believe you.
because this is bullshit.
Oh, come on. Barrow and me?
give me some credit.
Willa with a wig.
wow, that girl never ceases to surprise.
can I have the rest of those tapes？
Mm...
just for safekeeping?
I'll have one of my assistants drop them off.
well, McPherson, I hope it was as good for you as it was for me.
I have a copy of Brent's autopsy.
as Lucy said, he died of carbon monoxidesoning, but the list of drugs in his system is pretty startling, if, um...
if anybody is interested.
Oh, my God!
you lying sack of shit! I lost the movie!
I don't even have enough money to pay my own rent! Look, I didn't write- Somehow, some way...
I'm gonna return this favor, okay?
look, Mitch. Stop it! Stop it!
Farber didn't write the story about you. All right?
I did.
we had a thing and I found out about you, and I ran with it.
it's not his-- - So what? So what?
what am I supposed to do, not hate Farber now?
is that what you want?
okay. I don't hate him anymore. Feel better?
I just think he's pathetic for sing a heartless bitch like you.
how are you?
okay.
I gotta be back to set tomorrow, but I kinda got the feeling you needed me here tonight.
that's sweet. - No, but wait a second.
before you let me in, um, know something.
look, as soon as I'm done with this movie,
Julia or no Julia...
I'm going public with this relationship.
so you have an option.
you have to make a decision here.
if, um...
if you don't let me in...
that's going to be the end of us, all right?
I'm not going to be happy about it, but I'll understand, so...
but if you do let me in...
we can't hide this anymore.
we can't. I can't do that.
so, you gotta make the decision here.
you gotta figure it out.
get you anything?
no, I think I'm good.
Oh. I want to introduce you to somebody.
Holt, this is my mom. Mom, this is Holt.
it's nice to, uh, meet you finally,
Mrs. Weston.
I just want you to know that I have every intention of taking full advantage of your daughter tonight.
so if there's any objections, um...
let me know, all right?
give us a second here? I'm sorry.
let the woman speak. Thank you.
thank you. I appreciate that.
she loves me. She does.
I don't know what to tell you, but she does.
she approves, too.
