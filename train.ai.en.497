Searle discusses the relationship between language and mind, stressing that meaning should be interpreted with regards to the intentionality in the speech acts.
Searle's new book is an exceptionally elegant and incisive account of how we manage to, so to speak, be both inside and outside our heads at the same time.
Searle's speech act theory emphasizes the combination of the meaning, intention and common practice, because the basic unit of language communication is the illocutionary act.

sears, another american retailer, recently revived a savings plan it used many years ago, known as the "layaway programme," under which a consumer can make a down payment on an item that is then held for him for a fixed period while he saves the rest of the cash needed to buy it.
sears, for example, could squeeze its branded suppliers by marketing its own kenmore brand properly, says mr chugani.
sears, for example, is advertising a kitchenaid artisan series stand mixer for$ 319.99 this black friday.
sears, however, failed to reassert its reputation with customers and strengths in the supply chain when the shoppers of middle america began to drive to out-of-town malls.
sears, says spector, "tried to hold onto what they were rather than trying to invent themselves.
