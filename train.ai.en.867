nice. - What?
switching Janice's appointment time so I could see the skies brighten like a lifetime TV movie.
I don't know what you're-- - taking your most improved study participant in my face.
is that your way of getting into my pants?
I don't make the schedule, and if I did, I wouldn't use it as a social lubricant.
and this is the first I've heard of Janice improving at all.
so, hey, thanks for the good news.
pain started in his abdomen.
now it's hopped from his left thumb to his left leg, skipping the trunk entirely.
I need the name of a good lawyer.
we're getting sued? - Probably. That's Cuddy's problem.
hopping pain, means it's something in his brain, not his body.
except the pain's in two places that connect to two separate regions of the brain, which means you're not using yours.
come on, you're from one of the 12 tribes.
you know must know a ton of shysters.
what type of lawyer do you need?
I'll bring it up at the next world domination subcommittee meeting.
didn't say I needed a lawyer.
I said I needed the name of a lawyer.
pain hopped to another limb on the same side.
it's got to be central-- - could still be peripheral.
if multiple areas of disc disease were consistent with a completely spotless MRI.
who represented the hospital when you set that patient on fire?
Chris? That doesn't sound like a very good lawyer.
if we can't even resolve body versus brain, we're never gonna diagnose the guy.
what was the name of the firm?
caddell and Carrick. It's not like we can chop off his head to see if the pain goes away.
why not?
need to cut off a guy's head.
got to figure out if his pain's coming from his brain or his body.
a stiff shot of lidocaine below the brain stem should numb him all the way down to his tippy toes.
and hearing me say "no" over the phone wasn't good enough?
I'm inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me.
you know that foster-care official is coming in the morning.
if they weren't, there'd be no inconvenience.
do not try and force me to choose between my child
I'm forcing you to do your job!
if you can't also
fine, you want to separate a patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body.
if the pain stays, it's in his brain. If it vanishes
and what about options three, four, and five?
his respiratory system freezes, or he dies of infection, or he leaks cns fluid like a fire hydrant, which would make him wish he were dead?
you need to scratch option five. He's already there.
you preach objectivity, but as soon as a patient comes in in pain, all you want to do is look under the hood.
you don't care if there's a one-in-three chance you'll kill him.
if I don't diagnose him, there's a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself.
I got to go.
do whatever it is you think is right.
Tammy, you said you were gonna be a little late.
D. Y.F. S.Is gonna be here in an hour, and this place is a disaster.
never mind.
this should numb everything from your shoulders down.
any pain that's peripheral should be gone.
what are you doing here? - just stretching my leg. Carry on.
bad pain day today?
about to get better. Don't worry. He's making yours a double.
I remember when the drugs still made things tolerable.
I still thought I had good days left.
turns out you have to live to find out.
you don't have a family, do you?
left them all back on krypton.
you're alone.
that's why you can handle your pain.
no need to put up a front, to be what anyone else wants you to be.
you're having more bad days lately, aren't you?
Yes.
take a look at your future.
let's hope the drugs work this time.
I really wasn't expecting you till later.
had a cancellation, so I thought I'd knock you off the docket.
well, I'm sorry this place is such a mess. It's been a bit of a difficult work week.
any guns in the house?
uh, no.
pets? Besides the ants? - No.
nice bag. Pricey way to ditch the diapers.
that's not what I usually-- um, I sort of panicked.
Mr. Carlton, if you'd just give me a minute to explain.
everything looks fine. - Really?
Dr. Cuddy, you've got sufficient income, a high degree of personal and professional stability, and you care enough to be embarrassed by what a mess this place is.
believe me, that puts you head and shoulders above most of the foster moms I visit.
see you next year, if you haven't adopted her by then.
my legs... they're different. Better.
no pain at all? - No, but less.
four out of ten, maybe five.
can't be.
if whatever is causing the pain is in your brain, it's still a ten.
periphery is zero.
it is. Some of the pain is gone, but not all of it.
what does this mean?
maybe Taub was right.
it's psychosomatic after all.
which one of you is house?
the big black guy.
next time you use my name in a threatening e-mail, it won't be just a bill.
it'll be a lawsuit.
can you blame me? The last time that happened, the guy shot me.
what if the spinal block triggered some sort of placebo effect?
guy's taken the finest opiates blue cross can buy.
how come they didn't trigger a placebo effect?
what happened?
he just started screaming, do something!
please, god, do not let it be what his father has.
I think he's faking.
how dare you? What makes you think?
house, the kid's in excruciating-- - where is he going?
where is it? - Where's what?
his idiot son distracted the orderlies so that daddy death wish here could down a bottle of isopropyl.
get him on dialysis, or in half an hour, he'll be a corpse.
you're hurting me. - Remember the feeling.
maybe next time you want to help pops, you'll do a better acting job.
you can't help him.
Zach, why did you do this?
because he's not dad anymore.
he just wants it to be over with.
please. Please, just--just let him die.
fabry disease might be able to cause central and peripheral pain.
no angiokeratomata.
lightning pain from syphilis.
all the syph tests were negative.
why aren't you guys still talking? - Because we ran out of ideas.
nothing explains this.
something has to.
unless... nothing does.
so now you think-- - mine's a more interesting version of nothing.
it used to be something.
we can't find anything because whatever injury caused the original pain healed a long time ago.
the only thing left is the drugs.
opioid induced pain.
pain and the drugs that treat pain work by changing brain chemistry, sometimes to the point where pain receptors read painkillers as killer pain.
take him off the drugs.
we can't cure him, so we're gonna torture him?
torture is his cure.
eventually his body will recalibrate itself.
assuming you're right.
Yes. I find it confusing to assume otherwise.
how would you like to stop taking vicodin?
good thing I'm not the patient.
it's open.
thank you. - Is it too big?
she'll grow into it. You can put it there.
I take it the home inspection was pushed back.
I passed.
you do realize that's a good thing?
this place was a disaster.
I had to stash a dirty diaper in my briefcase.
so you buy another briefcase.
I let House supervise himself.
that's like handing a 12-year-old the keys to the liquor cabinet and the car.
you passed the inspection.
the patient lived. The car is still in the driveway.
and the next time my nanny gets sick when House wants to saw someone in half?
did I mention you passed the inspection?
by their meager standard. I failed by mine.
why do women always do that?
fail?
create ridiculous standards that no human could meet, with your careers, with your kids.
you got to be more like us men.
be lazy? Blame others?
get help!
most men in your position have a deputy and two assistants at work, and a wife and two nannies at home.
you're not superwoman. Don't be a martyr.
we'll be injecting you with naloxone, which will knock the opioids out of your pain receptors.
if we're right, your system will recalibrate within a few hours, and most of the pain will be gone.
hours? I need those drugs.
not if they're causing your pain.
then knock me out, sedate me while you-- - that'll take drugs too.
we need to clear everything out of your system.
please, I'll try anything else.
that's what we're trying to stop.
so it's not your parents.
then it's your wife, someone you were close-- - a colleague.
we were residents together.
I should've done more to stop it.
he had the mother of all god complexes.
so busy treating everyone's problems, he was blind to his own.
helped himself to a vial of insulin.
it's a miracle he survived.
his friends and family almost didn't.
he was a selfish ass.
it'll be over soon.
this is lunacy.
you're torturing this guy on a hunch.
it's the only hunch we've got.
if I really wanted to torture him, I'd manipulate a clinical trial in the hopes that he'd sleep with you.
are you suggesting I got thirteen in that trial because of some personal
I think you got her in because of your usual messiah complex.
I think you messed with the appointment schedule because of your "I like to have sex"complex.
I checked the logs.
you moved your most promising patient right before her.
false hope being quite the aphrodisiac.
how's it false if the trials are showing results?
well, if it were that promising, you wouldn't have to change the schedule.
but, hey... hope springs eternal.
this was a cooking accident?
first time making cherries jubilee.
awfully big fire.
if you ask me, some of the portions in that recipe were off.
sure hope it happens to be covered under, say, section three, subsection 2. 2,paragraph one, accidental fire damage, in which case you'd have to replace the entire waterline to fix the sagging pipe.
I guess so.
hate to have your next-door neighbors end up with no hot water.
lucky the fire escaped your pipes entirely.
it's not working.
I know. I started him back on the pain meds... which means you can leave. - My son was right.
I tried for so long to protect him from...
but I'm the one who's been selfish.
this is no way for him to live.
until we get an answer, it's the only way.
there is no answer.
there's always an answer. - Then what is it?
he's been here four days.
three suicide attempts. You don't have an answer.
when I saw you...
when I saw the cane, I thought, "thank god."
the doctor will understand.
because I sure as hell don't.
my husband thinks it's over.
so look me in the eye, tell me you'd want to live like that.
then stabilize him.
get him in decent enough shape for the drive home.
so he can finally...
okay.
there's got to be something we can do. We can't just let the patient leave.
we didn't. House did.
because he realized there's nothing he could do.
there's always something we can do, something else we can try.
you're insane. You know that, right?
because I have principles?
because you paid more to bribe me to lie on your claim than the entire cost of the repair.
I don't care if I pay, as long as the pple who pocketed my premiums for the last nine years also pay.
I didn't break the pipe.
whatever. If you want to stick it to the man, that's fine by me.
you happy? - Nope, but I'm right.
lock upon your way out.
and don't touch the piano.
testicles. What do they make you think of?
STDs, testosterone issues, that summer on fire island.
Oh, so close.
the correct answer is epilepsy.
epilepsy doesn't cause chronic pain.
it does if it spreads to the sensory region of the brain, then rewires the pain neurons.
would've shown upon an EEG.
not if the seizures are in a place you can't see on an eeg, a place too deep in the brain, like the area that controls the muscles supporting the... testicles.
feels like you got kicked in the nads, doesn't it?
the abdominal pain, how it all started.
it wasn't the stomach. It was lower, right?
it's everywhere.
but when it first started.
it started in the stomach--cramps.
like bad gas, or a permeating pain... like your kidneys are being pulled out through your scrotum.
Why?
because epilepsy is treatable.
like we shot the guys with the torches.
Yeah. Pays to hang around.
that selfish ass with the god complex who almost made the stupidest decision of his life wasn't your colleague, was it? It was you.
no.
see you tomorrow.
you're here early.
I'm feeling better.
what's wrong? - I. V.'S leaking a little. It's no big deal. I'll be right back.
you busy tonight?
no.
Rita, the spike on dr. Hadley's I. V. Bag wasn't pushed in all the way.
I don't want any dosing errors. - Sorry. It won't happen again.
it stinks, doesn't it? - What?
the medication. When we switch out the bags, you can smell it. It's disgusting.
I didn't smell anything.
Oh, she must be on the placebo, then.
you offered to do house's budget because you wanted him to owe you, wanted him to take that case. Why?
I thought it would help House-- seeing someone worse off than him, possibly curing a guy who has even less to look forward to.
can I ask yousomething?
how would you like my job?
the trick to onions-- cut them in half length wise, but leave the roots on.
then make your vertical slices.
need a dozen. Think you can handle this?
a dozen is 12, right?
next, we add mustard greens-- spicy, and they pack a nice punch.
Plus, they're really good for you.
improve mental function, protect against rheumatoid arthritis.
even inhibit certain types of cancer.
are you going to chop those onions or give them a thai massage?
well, I guess a happy ending is out of the question.
I don't recall adding making snide remarks to your list of duties.
just taking initiative.
secret ingredient: Porcini mushrooms.
you want to reconstitute them in bowl of water.
you also want to hirean assistant who can stay focused for longer than 30 seconds.
why don't I hear you chopping?
just give me a second.
you're kidding me right? - So sorry.
are you okay? You want to sit down?
my lips are blue. Cyanosis.
pain in my back and chest.
spontaneous pneumothorax.
what are you talking about? - I'm a doctor.
you are? - And I need a doctor.
te
I know gas is expensive, but I could've given you a ride.
elevator's broken.
it was fine when I came up from admitting.
Dana miller, the cancer researcher.
spontaneous pneumothorax.
awfully thin file.
she just got admitted.
lots of things can cause pneumothorax.
why don't we let eight or ten other doctors rule out the boring stuff?
we wanna take this case.
she's maybe five or ten years away from curing retinoblastoma.
which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurab.
she hasn't suffered from copd. She doesn't smoke. She hasn't been scuba diving.
O2 sats are low even after chest tube insertion.
pneumothorax could be secondary to a bunch of things.
cystic fibrosis, lung cancer.
or, to be slightly more optimistic, late-onset asthma triggered by an unknown allergen.
we have a case?
did you just get to work?
am I in trouble?
did you take the elevators up?
Yes.
so, steroids for asthma?
Yeah. Do a ct looking for hyperinflation to confirm.
I thought my hospital was high-tech.
I'd have to wait all day for a CT.
Dr. House gets a few perks.
he has his own scanner?
no, just very loose interpretations of hospital procedure.
I appreciate the extra effort, but our gift to society.
we want to get you back to work as soon as possible.
well, I'm not working.
at least not as a doctor. I quit.
I left eight months ago.
you mean, like, a sabbatical?
I had a uterine myoma. Benign.
but it ruptured and I needed emergency surgery.
I was lying there on the table thinking, "I can't die now. I haven't been happy yet."
couldn't you just buy an overpriced german sports car, or have an affair?
my sports car is doing what I want when I want.
right now I'm learning how to run a kitchen from one of the best chefs in New York.
you're washing pots and smashing garlic?
smashing garlic makes me happy.
before that it was eight years studying, 12 years in that lab.
it was always what I was supposed to do, and never what i wanted to do.
come here. Look at this. Come here.
adorable.
elevators keep crashing.
is mercury in retrograde or what?
elevators can be capricious.
sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you.
she keeps playing with the blanket. Why would she do that?
why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?
I don't know.
maybe they wanted to take time off to spend with their little dumb waiter.
but they the had to leave it at home with an elevator sitter because you drovethe replacement elevator to quitting because you're incapable of listening to anybody but me.
that's just a theory.
you're wrong. I don't even listen to you.
either do your job or go home.
leave me out of it.
I am gonna do my job.
it doesn't mean I have to do it happily.
doesn't mean I have to do it without resentment.
and it definitely doesn't mean I have to do it without seeking vengeance on the person making me be here.
Congratulations.
you've officially dragged me down to your level.
okay.
Hey, blue.
it's not asthma. Lung volume is normal.
she did have a uterine myoma removed eight months ago.
central line intravenous injection could have made a hole near the lung that slowly expanded.
no pleural thickening.
I can't believe she quit.
people have the right to be happy.
I saw a four-year-old with retinoblastoma on my oncology rotation.
the cancer had eaten through her eye and into her brain.
horrible diseases exist.
it doesn't mean people should give up recreational anything.
why not? Big picture-- I don't care if jonas salk's life is a miserable shell.
I just want him to cure polio.
you can't live your life "big picture."
you've gotta look out for yourself and the people you care about.
well, then, why are you a doctor?
why aren't you sitting by a pool in fiji knocking back mai tais?
people act in their own self-interests.
you're all here because you're happy to be here.
or at least because it's your best option.
I'm here because I want to help people.
no, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people.
Taub and foreman are here because they've got no other viable choices.
and thirteen is desperate to make her life matter before it's over.
so... you're happy to be here?
does it show?
are those increased interstitial markings?
could be pulmonary fibrosis.
do a biopsy.
you've got to look out for the people you care about.
that wouldn't have anything to do with you screwing over your clinical trial by slipping thirteen the real drug, would it?
you said that would be stupid.
does she know?
because jonas salk would not approve.
there's nothing to know.
got it?
good? - Yep.
you okay? - Just a headache.
I took some ibuprofen, but-- - where's the pain: Front or back?
front.
why are there never any interesting pictures on these cards?
they should make a dirty version.
a sharp pain, or more of a throbbing
relax, it's not a side effect.
people get headaches.
true, but I can get you an MRI.
if I'm on the drug, it's been weeks.
it's not like something's going to suddenly crop up now.
okay. First card.
train, duck...
you can't remember?
piano.
we need a biopsy to confirm
you need an open-lung biopsy to confirm pulmonary fibrosis.
that's invasive surgery.
I'd be out of commission for weeks.
no offense, but you're not working.
what does it matter if you spend a little time in bed?
not working doesn't mean I don't have places to go.
I've got my book group, piano lessons, cooking classes.
they make me happy.
a warm apple fritter makes me happy.
it doesn't fulfill meas a person.
and working here does?
if it didn't, I'd have found a way to go back to tucking tummies.
well, good for you. If your job fulfills you and makes you happy, that's rare.
I didn't say I was happy.
I loved being a plastic surgeon.
the money, the life style.
and in a lot of ways this job stinks.
I'm making five bucks, I'm always annoyed...
you can look yourself in the mirror and think, "I did something worthwhile today."
exactly.
well, that's important. And I do miss that.
but it wasn't just enough anymore.
that doesn't feel right.
sit up.
Oh, that's weird.
what is it? Ascites?
your belly's full of blood.
first her lung deflates, like me after a cold shor.
now her liver starts to bleed, like me after
you okay?
great.
just practicing my clown college audition.
someone set a trip wire.
we were with the patient the whole time.
we were in the grc.
lung, liver, go.
shouldn't you be obsessing over who did this to you?
Nope-- anybody bother mriing our patient's liver for tumors?
uh, no tumors, no cysts, no clear etiology.
if you're not obsessing, you must have already figured it out.
Yes.
so I'm obsessing about why you're not obsessing about why our patit's liver suddenly sprang a leak.
there's a tiny spot on the caudateobe. Could be a granuloma.
erodes into the hepatic artery, causes the bleed.
what caused the granuloma?
blastomycosis.
could have been a symptomatic for months.
it hits her lungs, we give her steroids.
it blossoms and attacks her liver.
get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light.
if it glows, sick children who need her souffles can breathe easier.
again?
you have a problem.
I told you, I didn't-- then you really have a problem.
the way she turned her head to look at the mri...
I think she's losingher peripheral vision.
because she turned her head?
I'm happy for you.
a love so deep you're ready to chuck your medical license to give her powerful, unproven drugs with dangerous side effects.
I don't want to make any assumptions about your feelings for me, but I do have a birthday coming up.
I hear cuddy's seal training finally came in handy.
should I be investing in a flak jacket?
you're safe.
no carpet bombing?
no burning of dresden to teach her a lesson?
well, since you're incapable of taking the high road,
I assume there's some deeper, more long-term strategy in effect.
Cuddy's not playing games.
she's not looking for leverage.
she wants pure, unadulterated vengeance.
and your counter-move isto let her have it?
the only time to strike backis when I want something.
all I want now is to get things back to normal.
which I can't get by escalating.
the only way to win this waris to lose it.
let her punch herself out.
Yeah, that makes sense too.
"Too"?
I was thinking you actually feel guilty about taking her away from her baby.
but your explanation's good too.
it's completely inconsistent with your character, but...
thank you, rationalization man.
you have saved the village.
you wanna eat?
you forgot your file.
Dana miller? The cancer researcher?
not anymore.
Dr. Miller, I doubt if you'll remember me
James wilson, right?
Chicago the adenocarcinoma conference.
impressive.
you want some cortisone for that itch?
liver failure.
itching is one of the lovely side effects.
why did you quit?
the worst thing is now every time I get sick, I have to listen to a dozen people judge me.
do you want me to congratulate you?
I've got four cancer kids right now who are gonna die.
three of them within a year, the other in a few days, probably.
breakthroughs will happen.
with or without me, someone will find the answer.
maybe.
I--I...
I'm in the trenches.
I'm--I'm doing triage as best I can.
you had the chance to end the war.
how is someone like me supposed to keep fighting when someone like you just walked away?
when I left my job, a lot of people were furious with me.
it was easier to be angry than to admit they weren't happy.
that they were stuck in a ruts ，omewhere in their lives, unable to move forward.
what's your rut?
okay, you're freaking me out.
do you think we should have kids?
we've had this conversation.
ten years ago. Things change.
on our third date I told you that I didn't want to have kids, and you said that you were okay with that.
I said it because I wanted to sleep with you.
and then I fell in love with you.
and I realized that I really could be okay with it.
it wasn't like I had this burning desire to have children.
God, have you been resenting me all this time? Is that why
no. Of course not.
I'm just... revisiting.
this isn't a whim for me.
it's not a decision that I made lightly.
don't you ever wonder what it would be like?
all the time.
just not enough to make me want to do it.
I like our life.
are you okay?
could you turn the tv back on?
look straight ahead.
why didn't we do this test this morning?
you see that? - No.
damn.
I'm losing my peripheral vision?
I am on the drug.
does this mean you have to tell them and take me off it?
no, and yes.
as far as they're concerned, you're on the placebo.
I found out last week.
the trial was getting positive results...
so I switched you.
so my headaches...
I'll stop taking the drug, and everything should be fine.
specimen's negative for blasmycosis.
that's it?
I'll go give house the test results. You can tell the patient.
we've been dating for two weeks.
you just broke trial protocol and risked your entire career to give me a drug we're not even sure will help me.
I don't think I'm ready for that.
Dr. Miller?
I'm sorry. The test was negative.
so I'm gonna take you off-- what happened to your head?
I don't know. I was sleeping. It's so itchy.
you were scratching it in your sleep.
you scratched right through your skull.
this is brain matter.
need some help in here!
I did a free flap closure to avoid any scarring.
she was lucky--the scratching didn't cause any brain damage.
but the first thing she said when we woke her up was it still itches.
itch receptors are only in the top two layers of skin.
which means she's not actually itchy, she just thinks she is.
so the problem's in her brain?
thank god we have you here to interpret that for us.
sorry, I have a headache.
could be psychogenic. She made big, sudden change in her life.
could be the result of a mental imbalance.
she wants to do what she wants to do. What's crazy about that?
why do you have to quit to do it?
if I want to do something, I do it.
if you can figure out a balance, there's no burnout.
thanks for the lesson, deep.
the itching started yesterday, not eight months ago.
meningitis, encephalitis...
those are diffuse processes. This is localized, could be plaques.
ms would explain, possibly the lungs.
so would a brain tumor.
well, how 'bout we stop guessing and mri her head instead?
you want to talk about your headaches?
not particularly.
you went off the drug, but the headaches are worse.
you need an mri.
the patient needs an mri.
if she had gangrene, would you be amputating my leg?
those pills have codeine in them?
you're taking twice the indicated amount.
I've only been off the drug for 24 hours, so I think the bigger issue here is that I've been off you for 24 hours.
you have worsening headaches, loss of peripheral vision, and a long history of pretending bad things aren't happening.
you really think this is just about my hurt feelings?
I don't remember demoting you.
I brought you something.
the latest issue of parent magazine.
really interesting column.
apparently, working moms are actually more engaged and attentive than stay-at-home moms.
something about personal fulfillment.
that's just a rationalization by working moms to justify not being with their kids.
which is fine, if that's what they want. It's not what I want.
and this is nurses quarterly.
the point is
you're only here to get back at me by dumping dirty mop water on my carpet.
just get it over with so I can get back to work.
I'm sorry.
I figured... I don't know, one of us needed to go out on a limb.
I thought I could help you.
it's hard to have a conversation when I'm trying not to move.
Oh, god.
patient's mri was negative.
no tumors, no lesions.
Where's your cane?
where are your coworkers?
I paged them. - It could still be psychogenic.
technically, it can't still be that, because it never could be that.
she scratched through her skull while she was sleeping.
unless she was having a dream about fleas
funny you should drop by.
we were just talking about this patient of ours.
tell him the part about where two of her doctors don't show up--where are you going?
Polyneuropathy. It's not in the brain, it's in the nerves.
it explains the itching, the lungs, the liver.
shock the affected area, reboot the nerve-- she'll be fine.
how bad is she?
she's got a tumor in her optic chiasm.
you don't need your coat treat a tumor.
I'm going to the drug company.
to tell them that you compromised their trial, your ethics, and the patient's health?
that's a great idea.
they have recorded on hundreds of patients.
I can ask them for access, find out if other patients developed tumors and how they were treated.
this drug inhibits cell death.
I think I could take a wild guess at how I treat that.
stop taking it? - Yeah.
she tried that yesterday.
Oh, my god, it's been a whole day, and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?
if you get on that elevator, and it's only'cause you're worried about getting to sleep tonight
I want to be able to tell her this happened to other people, and they're fine now.
so tell her.
I'm not gonna lie to her.
a little late for that.
you need to wait.
because if this thing doesn't go away, she's gonna need you to still have a medical license.
so I spoke with house. He thinks we should just
my leg is bleeding. - What happened?
I was going for the phone, and I fell over the table.
I can't see.
what do you mean?
I can't see anything.
you gonna tip housekeeping?
get it from cuddy.
don't tell me-- she burned your apartment to the ground.
the warmth would have been nice.
no heat, no power.
apparently Mrs. House called the utilities and told them we were moving.
you have 17 messages.
and your non-involvement strategy doesn't seem to be working.
hang up, he's here.
we've been paging you all night.
by all means, let's discuss the failed attempts to contact me, not the reason behind them.
patient started experiencing spinal shocks before the machine was turned on.
Lhermitte's sign.
shocks without shock, an itch that won't stop.
she needs dr. Seuss.
Lhermitte's sign could mean behcet's, B12 deficiency.
no sores, no anemia. Where's foreman?
no idea.
could be another demyelinating disease.
why are you asking about foreman and not thirteen?
because both questions are bound to have the same answer.
ebony and ivory are joined near the hip.
forget the brain. Look lower.
the spinal tumor wouldn't explain the liver or the lungs.
but an aggressive spinal hemangioma could.
go find it.
you didn't answer the door.
probably because I didn't want to talk to anyone.
you can leave your stolen key on your way out.
I was looking for foreman. I figured...
you can't see.
where is he?
on his way to the drug company.
tell him to come back. I'll dial.
if they can help.
you think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about?
you need radiation, not ritual sacrifice.
he asked for my advice before he switched you off the placebo.
I told him to do it if he loved you.
he only thinks he loves me.
it's the same thing.
Yes, he's an idiot.
you didn't ask him to do anything. You're pissed off that he did.
so let him torch his career to pay for his sins.
unless you actually feel something for the idiot.
in which case, you might want to tell him to turn around.
you're hurting him.
good, after all the stunts he's pulled on me.
you're physically hurting him.
that's the point.
what's the point?
what do you think you're going to accomplish?
house shouldn't be allowed to make people miserable. - without paying for it. - You're not miserable!
you're telling me how I feel?
you're here because you like this.
you like working with him.
wow, if only I'd known I was having fun, I wouldn't have canceled the bouncy house.
fire him, and go home with your new baby.
I like what he does for this hospital.
what he does is who he is.
and the same goes for you.
slow down.
unless you want to radiate her heart instead of her brain.
of course, then your problems would actually all go away.
Thanks.
I'm not beating myself up enough already over this.
entering the left common carotid.
you broke the rules.
girlfriend went blind.
you gotta be ready for losing to be one of the possibilities.
you're at the carotid bifurcation.
I knew that giving her the rug would be bad for me if I got caught.
I never thought it would be bad for her.
nobody else was having adverse reactions.
you did it because you love her.
ironically, you never took her into consideration.
can't wait to see what you get her for your anniversary.
catheter's adjacent to the optic chiasm. We're in position.
Nukey, nukey.
what's going on with everyone today?
it involves house, foreman, and thirteen, which means it's either dumb, dangerous, or tragic, or a combination.
I'm embracing my ignorance.
house was right about the hemangioma.
looks fixable.
what's that?
hemangiomas travel solo.
this thing has brought a friend.
masses in her lungs and spine.
one in her pericardium. - They're everywhere.
classic mesothelioma.
it metastasized outward to the spine and muscles.
Ah, the irony of it.
maybe she wouldn't be sick at all if some other lazy cancer researcher hadn't gone home early.
where are foreman and thirteen?
shouldn't you be saying, "those weren't there when we scanned her two days ago"?
mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.
good rephrasing. Have wilson do a biopsy to confirm.
no.
something weird is going on.
it involves our colleagues-- we should know.
you want us to treat the patient, tell us what's going on.
actually, all he needs us to do is tell wilson to do something. So...
you always blab to watch people react.
so not blabbing means you don't want us to react, which can't be good.
is thirteen's headache not just a headache?
if I check with admitting, am I gonna find her name?
a little pinch.
I'm sorry about the other day. I... unloaded on you.
you're not sorry.
you feel bad because mesothelioma means I'm dying.
great person. I appreciate the sentiment.
I'm not apologizing because you're dying.
I'm apologizing because you were right.
I am stuck.
my girl friend died.
she was the only person I've loved for a long time, and...
I'm still living in her apartment. I'm surrounded by her things.
I have left it all exactly where it was.
I don't know how to get unstuck.
the only wrong thing is to do nothing.
Yeah.
all right.
that's not supposed to happen.
have you thought about going to the drug company, see if they can help?
I thought about it.
we need to give it more time. It's been half a day.
this thing keeps growing, there's other stuff in your brain you might need later on.
if I were any other patient, you'd both be in the lounge, eating donuts.
you're not any other patient. - Right.
any other patient, you don't feel guilty.
but you don't get to torch your career to pay for your sins.
house told her to say that, didn't he?
does that make it any less true?
you think he's right?
who cares? You're a hypocrite.
you don't ask her if she wants to be on the drug, but when there's a chance you could help her get better, suddenly you're letting her call the shots?
that's not being noble. That's saving your own ass.
I'd feel worse if he destroyed his career.
mesothelioma doesn't bleed.
so what causes masses that do bleed?
Avm's secondary to schistosomiasis.
she'd be crawling with worms. We'd have noticed it.
gorham's disease and kasabach-merritt can both cause super-aggressive vascular tumors.
patient's heart just stopped.
so what causes that?
cardiac tamponade. She's bleeding into her pericardium, smothering her heart.
syringe.
B. P.'S going back up. It's working.
no, it's not-- look.
we're transfusing platelets, ffp, everything to try to keep her stable.
but we can barely keep up with the blood loss.
at this rate, she could be dead by the end of the day.
we need to resect the vascular tumors, stop the bleeding.
too late-- no surgeon's gonna touch her now.
should we give up? Just let her bleed out?
don't be silly.
you know what that would do to our malpractice insurance rates?
we go on the offensive.
cut off the invading army's supply line.
you're talking about embolization?
cut off the arteries that feed blood to the tumors, they wither and die.
start with the ones in her lungs.
if they get any bigger, she's gonna have a hard time breathing.
so she'll have a hard time telling us she's dead.
you can't kill the tumors without also killing healthy tissue.
if we wipe out3/4 of her lungs...
let's hope that running marathons wasn't on her happy list.
I found this.
in the, uh, coat closet.
where I hid it.
thought I'd never see you again.
little, little greg.
Yeah, you heard me right!
well, you are who you are.
it's annoying, but... it's not your fault.
it isn't about you. I...
I'm sorry.
because you were doing this job perfectly until the baby came along.
what?
I'm apologizing. Can't you just accept my
I accept.
we gonna have to do this dance again in 28 days?
what the hell is wrong with you?
yesterday, you hate me.
today, you're practically weeping on my shoulder.
I can only assume that what I'm hearing is your aunt flow telling me...
when I was being a jerk, you suddenly act human.
but when I act human, you turn back into a jerk.
guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.
this is your way of saying you accept my apology, isn't it?
Nope, this is my way of saying you were doing a crappy job before; you will a slightly crappier job now.
everything keeps going. Nature of life. Nature of parenthood.
or this whole thing is just an act.
and you've gone back to the part you think you need to play.
you should go talk to wilson.
rationalization man needs a faithful side kick.
now, rational man needs to go save a life.
house. If you're looking for returnable bottles, kutner's already cleaned it out.
Damn! Oh, well.
that means the only thing I'm gonna get out of this is a diagnosis.
so the nurses gave her pads instead of tampons.
is that diagnostically relevant?
fact that the nurses had to give her anything is.
means she's bleeding from her uterus.
women do that. It's perfectly natural. Not scary at all.
she menstruating and she's bleeding everywhere.
there's about a 3 or 4 in 28 chance it's a coincidence.
which leaves a much bigger chance that the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis.
she had a myoma eight months ago.
surgeons cut through her uterine wall.
every cut of the scalpel could have sent endometrial cells spilling out into her bloodstream.
some of them took up residence in her lungs, some in her liver, some in her spine.
and like all horny little cells, they went forth and multiplied till they reached a critical mass.
in the days leading up to her next period, when her uterusis supposed to swell, everything swelled.
and when her uterus was supposed to bleed, everything bled.
Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period.
granted, it's the worst period ever.
although, frankly, not by all that much.
cut out the masses, she'll be fine.
can't do surgery until her cycle's over and she stops bleeding.
well, let's hope she can hold out till then.
in the meantime, get her a pint of cookie dough ice cream and a dvd of beaches.
I'm sorry.
I can see you.
how you feeling?
relative to the last few days, awesome.
you almost died.
for the second time in eight months.
I know.
how do you feel about your life choices this time?
I didn't lie there thinking what if?
I always worry, on my death bed I'll think, "I didn't do anything really important."
you're gonna spend one day of your life on your death bed.
the other 25, 000 are the ones we should be worrying about.
go to bed happy tonight.
Dr. Schmidt.
it's eric foreman.
actually, he trial isn't going too well.
you told them, didn't you?
well, you really had no choice on account of being an idiot.
they gonna pull the drug?
I broke protocol.
her results are no longer admissible to the trial.
they don't have to do anything.
anyone else gets a tumor, they'll put a warning on the label.
gonna keep your license?
they'll come after me if I attempt to participate in any more trials.
that's very decent of them.
well, good for me.
I'll see you tomorrow.
and the next day. And the next day.
that wasn't your locker, was it?
it's a lock-er room.
how else are they gonna learn?
do you think you can't be happy without a kid?
I don't know.
I know I can't be happy without you.
you snore.
shut up.
it's okay, Eileen. I got this.
are you sure? - Yeah. You get home.
Thanks, Danny. See you in the morning.
I'll be here.
food's gone, Daryl. We're closed.
you wouldn't happen to have an extra coat in there, would you?
you're wearing a coat. - A winter coat, man. It's cold.
come on.
here.
Rangers? You expect me to wear this in jersey?
come on, man, where's your sense of humor?
good night, Daryl.
go away.
that's not funny, freak.
no one is laughing, Daniel.
you doing anything Friday?
taking a lovely young lady to the philharmonic.
that your way of saying you're having sex with a hooker?
two. Can't create a harmonic with just one.
well, I was hoping you might available for Rachel's simchat bat. It's a...
jewish baby-naming ceremony, a time-honored tradition dating all the way back to the 1960s.
my house at 7: 00.
it'll just be the Rabbi and a few friends and some family.
nothing like welcoming a baby into the world with a completely naked display of hypocrisy.
there'll be plenty of wine and nice people you can quietly mock.
wish I could, but I already put down a deposit on 16 crates of jell-O.
it's one evening. I'd like you to be there.
religious hokum, get sponge bath.
can I get back to you?
can I help you?
just browsing. Thanks.
happy to be underachieving again?
running the E. R.is slacker heaven.
looking for anything in particular?
not anymore. Where's this guy?
Why? - 'Cause he's my next patient.
it'd be rude of me not to introduce myself.
he's a drunk priest who hallucinated Jesus.
afraid you might have missed something?
afraid you're everyone's time?
it's obviously either alcohol or exhaustion.
so you admit you have no idea which?
I admit that I'm too busy to care who you're screwing with.
don't thank me. Just knowing I can be of assistance is thanks enough.
you went out of your way to pick him?
this is nothing. - There are no small cases.
any guesses where this joke is going?
could be psychomotor epilepsy... - could be alcohol.
shouldn't we let the E. R. rule the obvious out
could be atropine toxicity, occipital lobe tumor.
you know something about this case you're not telling us?
why would you think that?
cause you want to screw with us.
or screw with a hallucinating priest.
both are possible. There's only one way to find out.
run an E. E.G. For epilepsy. C. T. His brain for tumors.
and go check his house of god for toxins.
fourteen, hold up.
this department is broken, and I'm not gonna take a real case until it's fixed.
job or relationship-- your choice.
what?
to put iin terms you might better understand, if you don't split, you must quit.
the drug trial is over. Me out, she's out.
don't care.
we're adults. We can handle this. You just have to give us a chance.
no, you're not. No, you can't. And no, I don't.
mull it over. You got until the end of this fake case to decide.
I wasn't drunk.
I had one or two drinks.
people often underestimate alcohol's effect on their
I was on my way to six. I know how alcohol affects me. This wasn't the alcohol.
you lived in Manhattan for three years.
then a year in Oregon, 18 months in new Mexico, less than a year in Wisconsin, and now you've been living in Trenton for the last six months.
Yep.
the more we know about you, the more likely it is we can help you.
mm, it's not medically relevant, so
no way to know unless you went to medical school.
four years ago, a teen in a youth group at my church accused me of inappropriate contact.
I was innocent, but the church decided to transfer me.
said it would be easierfor all involved.
when the parishioners at the new church got wind of why I'd been transferred, they were unhappy.
I was sent off again and again, and how is any of that medically relevant?
so the kid lied?
he was confused.
confused whether you molested him or not?
okay, you wanted to know why I moved around so much, and I told you.
how about telling me why I was hallucinating?
syphilis could explain the hallucination.
I'm not sexually active.
you don't have to admit you did anything with the kid. You weren't always a priest.
I wanted to be since I was 12. I entered the seminary when I was 17.
maybe it wasn't a hallucination. Maybe it really was Jesus.
I'm not insane.
seeing Jesus makes you insane?
a bit of an odd attitude coming from a priest.
well, it's just a job now. The fairy tale ended a long time ago.
you're a wuss--part wimp, part puss.
I have no choice. I'm part of the ceremony.
I thought you were already circumcised.
it's one night for a friend.
what about the friend who has two tickets to see Brubeck at the blue note?
I thought you had an orgy planned. - I lied.
are you lying about the Brubeck tickets?
Yes, but only to save you from yourself.
I'll be fine and so will Cuddy if you don't show up.
I'm surprised she even invited you.
it is oddly flattering.
God, I'm so sick of his stupid stunts.
everybody has to put up with their boss's stupid stunts.
no, they don't.
there's H. R. There're Cuddy. There's other jobs.
house doesn't listen to H. R.
Cuddy will let him fire us before she fires him, and I don't want another job.
why do you clinging him? Why do you defend him?
just because I don't want to be unemployed doesn't mean I'm codependent.
I'm not saying you're codependent. I'm saying you're scared.
you know what?
you're right.
so you want to quit?
no, I want to stop a stupid stunt.
house doesn't want either one of us to quit. He wants this.
he's got two lab rats in a maze and thrown in one piece of cheese.
S--so what do we do?
nothing.
cool. - It's cool he's a child molester?
it's cool the priest doesn't believe in god.
it's cool that god did to him what he did to the kid.
allegedly.
you think he's innocent? - He had honest eyes?
and you think he's guilty, which explains why you're dying to discharge him.
I'm dying to discharge him because he's not sick, not because he's a pedophile.
allegedly.
you actually believe the kid got confused?
if everybody lies, that includes teenage boys.
aren't we luck to have such an interesting patient?
Had--there's nothing wrong with him.
the world's most boring case just became a page turner.
you want to tear out the last chapter?
you want to examine his character, go to a soup kitchen.
we are done testing him for things he doesn't have.
bad news for Foreman and thirteen.
case is over. - We're not splitting up.
so which one of you is taking a hike?
and neither of us is quitting.
interesting.
you were fine with Chase and Cameron dating.
you obviously don't actually have an issue-- - you're fired.
how long are you gonna keep this up? We know you're not wrong again.
in fact, in the last few weeks, it's hard to remember a correct call you made.
if Chase had compromised his professional judgment to help Cameron, I'd have fired his ass, too.
when my mistake blew up, you did everything to keep me from contacting the drug company.
to save your lense, not your job and definitely not your relationship.
so, badge.
fine.
why don't you see if you can find us a real case?
how can you discharge me when you have no idea what's wrong?
we know what's wrong, and now that you've slept it off...
it's not just a hallucination.
I feel nauseous.
my foot feels numb like it's fallen asleep.
you didn't mention that before.
I didn't notice it before.
are you hiding from someone?
why are you so intent on staying here?
I don't feel well. I know there's something wrong with me.
which foot?
my left.
Oh, god.
what the hell is that? What is that?
your toe just fell off.
must be my lucky day.
new symptom means the dsymptom was a real symptom, and I get to keep our pederast priest after all.
where are Foreman and thirteen?
they left.
leprosy can cause necrosis and hallucination.
why would they leave?
because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and thirteen is mad that I fired him.
don't worry. She'll be back. She'll be pissed off. She'll want to take a stand.
and then Foreman will convince her that there's no reason both of them should be out of a job.
Leprosy's a bad fit.
why'd you fire Foreman?
I gave him a choice-- split or quit.
he chose neither.
what about ergotism?
he's giving up his career for her?
he's giving up this career for her.
no, normal white blood count.
carbon monoxide poisoning?
they're good doctors.
separately, they're great doctors, better than you.
together, they're morons.
go check out the house that they would've checked had this been a real case.
and page thirteen. Tell her to run the blood for c-O.
and get the priest in a hyperbaric chamber before anything else falls off.
so what are we gonna do now?
I get a letter of recommendation from Cuddy an find a new job.
Oh, that's it? You're just gonna give up?
house is right.
our relationship did affect my judgment.
then I should quit.
it'll be easier for me to find another job.
not like this one.
we should both quit.
what's that gonna accomplish?
don't worry.
I'll be fine.
we'll be fine.
go ahead.
I'll see you tonight? - I'll be home early.
you really think house is done with Foreman?
if you ask me, Foreman should be done with thirteen.
he's not gonna get a better job, which means he'll end up resenting her for losing this one, which she'll end up resenting.
or the hardship'll bring 'em closer together.
she'll invite friends over for Foreman to share.
no leaks in the heater.
she's not a nympho.
she's bisexual, which, by the way, means she'accustomed to partners who don't need a map to find the treasure.
c-o poisoning might have come from these cigarettes.
not unless he was smoking them in a bell jar.
and even if you know where the treasure is, it can still be pretty hard to dig it up without a shovel.
you can buy a shovel.
let's see...
how do I keep house from ruining my precious display of religious hypocrisy?
I know, I'll pressure him to attend, knowing that he'll never agree to anythingI actually want him to do.
I didn't pressure you. I invited you.
and there's nothing hypocritical about recognizing your heritage.
so you keeping kosher now, wearing four-cornered garments, slaughtering heifers to the god ra?
wait, is that one your people?
do it all, do nothing, or option "c"-- you're a liar and a hypocrite.
for better or for worse, you are a part of my life.
it isn't a ploy. It's a sincere invitation.
I honestly want you to come.
wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm glad.
you idiot.
I was free and clear.
now he's coming, and it's your fault.
since when have your failed attempts at communication through lies become my fault?
since you forgot how to keep your mouth shut.
you messed it up, and now you're gonna fix it.
and you're gonna keep my name out of it.
how is he?
stable. Necrosis doesn't look to be spreading.
I was talking about Foreman.
is he really gonna leave?
that's usually what people do when they get fired.
why are you biting my head off? I was just wondering what he was gonna do.
you're right. I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
it's not House's fault either.
he gave you guys a chance, you blew it.
uh, he didn't give us a chance, he gave us an ultimatum.
I would've thought five years here would buy a mistake or two.
help me!
help me!
I can't breathe! Feels like something's on my chest!
looks like a heart attack.
I assume you've heard.
I can't override him.
I'm not asking you to override him.
I'm asking for a letter of recommendation.
Eric, the reality here is House should've fired you.
you falsified medical records, put this hospital's reputation in jeopardy.
you're lucky you still have a license.
I can't get a decent position at another hospital without a recommendation.
I'm sorry.
chest pain wasn't angina. Ekg ruled out heart attack.
so the good news is, he didn't have a heart attack.
the bad news is, I apparently fired the only guy who actually knows what a heart attack looks like.
so the man of god who doesn't believe in god had a heart attack that isn't a heart attack.
do I know how to pick awesome cases or what?
could be a clotting disorder.
three different symptoms, three different clots?
I know. How cool is that?
you two do an angio.
you don't want to work, so why don't you just go get me a lottery ticket?
the sicker he gets, the luckier I feel.
where are you going?
I've been wanting to introduce myself.
are you really a virgin?
you have to treat me. You don't have to believe me.
and before we treat you, we have to diagnose you.
not knowing whether we can believe you is making that difficult.
everything I've told you is true.
you lost your faith because a teenager got confused?
and the church abandoned me, and my god forsook me, and I couldn't come up with a reason why god would do that.
God gave the church and the kid free will.
their exercise of that free will hurt you.
means you're just a victim of god's gift to mankind.
Oh, yeah. God wants life to have meaning. Life's meaningless without free will.
with free will, there's always suffering. So god wants suffering.
I got tired of that argument before I even finished saying it.
and even if I bought that, what the hell is god doing?
just the big stuff?
the acts of god, the hurricanes, the earthquakes, the random killings of millions of innocent people.
then we better damn pray.
God, I wish you weren'ta pedophile.
lungs are clean. No embolism. No pleurisy, no pneumonia.
I'm sorry. This is gonna hurt.
no, it's fine.
no pain at all? - No. Why?
because there should be. You feel that?
no.
regional anesthesia is a new symptom.
not if the chest painis related to the numbness.
it's not circulatory. It's neurological.
run a nerve-conduction study. And be careful.
if you kill him, he'll be dancing with the dark one.
why the hell are you going to Cuddy's baby naming?
it's a religious ceremony. It's boring.
why waste a good evening that could be much better spent in a drunken stupor feeling sorry for yourself?
okay. - Okay? Okay, you won't go?
okay, your obligation to Cuddy is fulfilled.
why are you doing this?
why did Hillary conquer Everest?
you always have a reason. It's usually a bad one, but a reason.
she's being childish.
see, that's an example from the bad category.
is it resentment?
the stork brought home a new baby, and you don't want to share mommy?
or you just can't stand to see others happy?
she's trying to play me.
if I let her succeed, the terrorists win.
I heard there might be an opening in the E. R.
Foreman's a neurologist. That's not where he
I did an E. R.Rotation in Miami.
if I can find another position, I figure house will rehire Foreman.
don't quit.
Cuddy wouldn't give Foreman a recommendation.
he's not gonna be able to find a decent job.
foreman shouldn't leave either.
you think they should split up?
office romances are a bad idea.
we beat some very long odds.
wow, why don't you save the gushy stuff for the wedding?
house is playing with you.
if you let him get away with it, he's not gonna respect you anyway.
or House is helping you. He knows it probably won't work out.
and he's actually doing you a favor.
Yeah, that sounds a lot more like House.
I know they're looking for someone at mercy. I'll make a call.
your boss always like that?
usually worse. Finding a fellow aeist always makes his day.
think it's possible maybe god's testing your faith?
no, I already failed.
there'd be no point in what he's doing to me now.
got something. Looks like inter costal neuralgia.
what's that?
something's traumatizing one of the nerves that runs along your ribs.
explains the chest pain and numbness. Could also cause muscle atrophy.
does it do anything to the eyes? - Wh what's wrong?
are you seeing Jesus again?
I'm seeing nothing.
ophthalmological exam's normal.
nothing structurally wrong with the eye.
his heart rate's down.
sensory loss is becoming more diffuse, progressive muscle weakness--he's shutting down.
it's got to be something systemic, like autoimmune.
CSF was clear for guillain-barre.
cancer?
imaging studies have been clear for tumors.
then that leaves infection.
he'd be brimming with white blood cells.
or we are at the back stage door of a duran duran concert.
hundreds of screaming girls clustered around.
what does that mean?
that girls like rock bands.
the presence of the fans indicates the presence of the band.
different night-- sa band, same door.
now there's not a girl in sight.
what does that mean?
sorry, I don't speak hair band.
they weren't a hair band. They were new romantics.
the band already left?
Nope, the band's still there, still rocking out.
when does the absence of the fans not indicate the absence of the band?
when it's 2009.
there aren't any duran duran fans.
they don't make them anymore.
if there's no infection, it's because there aren't any fans, no white cells.
you think his spleen?
why do I bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out?
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
go get a biopsy.
I'll try to get new moon on monday out of my head.
why are you talking this time?
if I quit, will you rehire Foreman?
Why?
he can't find another job.
I can.
and you're willing to make that sacrifice for him?
Yes.
does Foreman know about this plan?
Yes.
well, if he's okay with it, who am I to say no?
hold still.
you think it's my spleen?
that's what they're testing.
so if I happen to cure you, what happens then?
you start thinking that god was working through me?
this is some sort of miracle?
do you think I'm an idiot?
that's what I'm testing.
losing my faith wasn't a choice I made.
it happened. It's gone for good.
but if it can magically disappear, it can magically reappear, and that's what you're hoping.
your job...sucks.
that's my point.
you can make more money frapping decafs, and yet you're still ministering to the meek.
why do the lord's work if the lord has left the building?
I've been with the church my entire adult life.
it's my only marketable skill.
I detect t stink of leftover faith.
you want to talk hypocrisy, what about you?
you act like you don't care about anyone, but here you are saving lives.
solving puzzles.
saving lives is just collateral damage.
Yeah, nice try.
I don't think you're looking for somebody to prove you right.
I think you're looking for somebody to prove you wrong, to give you hope.
you want to believe, don't you?
Yeah, I want to walk out and find myself in a forest of whore trees, but I don't think it's a good idea to tell people to go fornicate with fruit.
Hey, I was just talking about you...
not you specifically--whores and hypocrisy.
you were right.
I don't want you there.
it's a special occasion filled with love and acceptance, and the last thing I need is someone there who's filled with loathing and contempt.
okay.
that's it?
you're really not coming?
I'm really not coming.
thank you.
you're welcome.
gosh, I feel so grown up.
he's obviously just jerking you around, wants to see if you're serious.
if you just stick it out, I think he'll bring Foreman back.
I don't, and even if I'm wrong, I think you should still split up.
it's just a matter of time before one of you finds the other in bed with another woman.
this coming from the relationship expert.
12 years and counting.
Hey, if you can make it that long, then anyone can.
funny how the two people in the room who think relationships are easy are both single.
I don't think they're easy.
that's why I think if you find something that could be good, you should hang onto it.
everything could be good.
very lite ever is.
his spleen is fine, just some insignificant traces of minor bugs.
nothing that'd make him sick.
which minor bugs?
why do people suddenly find religion when they have kids?
fear of the unknown.
cornerstone of faith.
I think it makes perfect sense.
so it makes sense because it doesn't make sense.
the fact that you're railing about it doesn't make a lot of sense.
you really got a thing for your boss, huh?
I've got a thing for my boss's thing.
she doesn't have a thing...per se.
I'm big on metaphors.
what about you?
29 years of celibacy.
what's holding you back now?
who wants a relationship with a priest?
who wants a relationship?
it's the holy water.
we assumed if it was an infection, it had to be something big and nasty.
but he has pneumocystis, a harmless bug that's everywhere and never makes anyone sick, unless they have a compromised immune system.
so father Nietzsche has aids.
impossible.
I've never had a blood transfusion.
I've never done I. V.Drugs.
I've never had sex.
so prove it. Have an aids test.
no.
I know I don't have aids.
we can't treat you until we know what it is.
a negative result proves nothing.
on the off chance it's a false positive, I permanently loseany credibility I have left.
I'd say you just lost that.
I'd say I lost that with you a long time ago.
we should start treatment for aids.
we need to be sure.
the antiretrovirals could fry his heart, his liver, his kidneys.
I'm willing to take that chance.
big of you.
I'm more worried about the kid he molested.
we should be finding him and getting him tested.
you don't think he already got tested?
maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that's a chance I'm not willing to take.
legally, we can't inform sexual partners about stds.
this isn't some middle-aged barfly who likes it bareback.
this is an innocent kid who was molested.
you just want to rub the priest's face in it, get him transferred again.
Yeah, heaven forbid a diddler has job issues.
and you get brought upon charges.
I've lost enough doctors this week.
treat him for aids.
I found a job.
I didn't know you were looking.
eggers at Mercy says I can start monday.
why would you
house says if I go, you can come back.
it's been less than two days.
give up on me that fast?
you get a job behind my back?
you're acting like I'm cheating on you.
I said I would handle this.
house knew you'd be like this.
I guess House knows me better than you do.
too bad I don't go both ways.
good night.
don't you hate when they put the mushrooms underneath the cheese?
your attendance is validating her hypocrisy.
if she invited you to a ceremonial lynching, would you go?
it would depend on what she was serving.
everyone's a hypocrite.
why are you suddenly so obsessed with Cuddy's particular brand?
just making conversation.
would you rather we go back to talking about mushrooms and cheese?
you're the hypocrite!
you want to go!
you don't resent this baby.
you want to be a part of it.
Yes, but not until her 16th birthday...in some states.
this is ridiculous.
you two deserve each other.
if you want to go, just go and act like a human being.
wow, solid advice, except for two things.
I'm acting like I don't want to go because I don't want to go, and...
I am incapable of acting like a human being.
Yeah.
I'm Dr. Chris Taub.
can we talk?
Yeah.
what's wrong?
uh, in private?
nobody's listening to us here.
um, I work at Princeton Plainsboro Hospital.
I have some news about father Daniel Bresson.
what about him?
uh, we believe he has aids.
okay, so?
Well...uh, given the incident four years ago,
I think you should be tested, unless you've already done so.
how sick is he?
very.
okay. Well, um, thanks.
have you been tested?
uh, yeah.
And?
and it really isn't any of your business.
I want my job back.
love, sacrifice, deception, and now betrayal.
this is better than a telenovela.
what going on?
Well...either Foreman is here, as the two of you discussed, to beg for his job back in exchange for me dumping you, or...nothing.
you're trying to get me fired?
I'm suggesting you quit and I stay, which is exactly what you suggested last night.
I told Eggers I didn't want the job.
find another one.
only took you eight hours to find that one.
the point is, why didn't you tell me you were doing this?
why are you here without me?
you're overreacting.
we'll talk about this later.
Oh, that's what this is about.
it's about you taking control.
it's about you not being able to handle me saving your ass.
and you're not being controlling right now?
Yeah!
who's the controlling bitch now?
house, shut up.
you never wanted to take that other job.
you never wanted to save me.
you wanted to offer to save me so you wouldn't feel guilty.
you knew I'd say no.
that's why you're so mad right now.
you're an idiot.
well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back.
welcome back.
aids meds aren't gonna work.
if you'd let us do a test, we could stop treating you, or you could stop lying.
I know the feeling.
bp's climbing.
you feeling okay?
no, I feel flushed.
Ah, I'm burning all over.
Ah, my chest.
it's not a new symptom.
it's just a reaction to the aids meds.
he reacted by getting worse.
means it's not aids.
so went Satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote Job sore with boils.
you think it's hyper-ige syndrome?
I prefer the colloquial term "Job syndrome.
explains the symptoms and my quote.
that's the first thing I checked.
ige levels are normal.
could be some other genetic disorder.
cerebral microtumors could explain the blindness and the hallucinations.
we didn't find any tumors.
that's why I didn't say "tumors.
I said "microtumors.
so your explanation doesn't depend on us being major morons, just morons?
we should start genetic testing.
it takes too long.
so we start treatment.
treatment is surgery.
we can't open him up without confirmation.
so your position is we can't test and we can't treat?
my position is you're wrong.
this isn't gonna work.
are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.
conflict breeds creativity.
go run the genetic tests.
on it.
so now you don't think I have aids?
I still think it's aids.
on the off chance it isn't, we're pursuing other avenues.
he's, um...he's dying?
uh, we don't know what's wrong with him.
can I speak to him?
I don't think that's a good idea.
um, why don't I get you
come on, Ryan, now's not a good ti
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm sorry.
I know. I know.
any second thoughts about Cuddy?
Nope.
but please, feel free to blather on.
raising a child on her own is scary.
she's just doing what you do, what everyone does-- trying to avoid pain.
religion is not the opiate of the masses.
religion is the placeboof the masses.
if you're saying she's not a hypocrite
I'm not.
I'm trying to give you a rational reason to overlook her hypocrisy so you don't feel like a hypocrite for going.
Oh, sorry.
continue.
okay, even if an absolute truth exists, we can't know all of it, and you can't condemn her for recognizing that.
are you eliminating symptoms?
we can know everything.
this is medicine not metaphysics.
truth is truth.
it fits.
it doesn't fit.
you can't eliminate a symptom.
I can if it's not a symptom.
well, what is it?
not a symptom.
you're not gonna die.
you have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
it impairs your immune system, makes you susceptible to all the aids stuff without actually having aids.
and you didn't catch it.
you were born with it.
another gift from god.
you sure?
genetic test should confirm it, but it explains all your symptoms-- toe, chest, eyes, skin.
what about my hallucination?
scotch explains that.
but that was just a coincidence.
coincidences do happen.
that coincidence is what brought me to you in the first place.
you promised you wouldn't go there.
einstein said,"coincidence is god's way of remaining anonymous.
a woman in Florida said,"look, Jesus is on my cheese sandwich.
you didn't even want to take my case.
you didn't even think I was sick.
the fact that I was wrong is not a proof of god.
I'm just trying to understand how my life could completely turn around in a single day.
don't worry.
your life will go back to sucking soon enough.
everything that happened to you can be rationally explained.
I know.
it's just that's a lot of coincidences.
house was right about the priest.
genetic test confirmed it was wiskott-aldrich.
and I would've discharged him.
everybody would've discharged him, House included.
he only took that case as a stall.
and yet it was a real case, and he solved it.
but by violating his own principles and ignoring the admitting symptoms.
still he somehow got away with it.
saved another life.
you want him there tonight.
you should tell him.
it's--it's cold out there.
at least you have shoes that cover your toes.
so it's tonight?
Yep.
bad weather for it, hu maybe you'll get lucky.
maybe your sister will decide the roads are too dangerous to drive on.
fingers crossed.
have fun.
Cuddy Serenade
it's okay, Eileen. I got this.
are you sure? - Yeah. You get home.
Thanks, Danny. See you in the morning.
I'll be here.
food's gone, Daryl. We're closed.
you wouldn't happen to have an extra coat in there, would you?
you're wearing a coat. - A winter coat, man. It's cold.
come on.
here.
Rangers? You expect me to wear this in jersey?
come on, man, where's your sense of humor?
good night, Daryl.
go away.
that's not funny, freak.
no one is laughing, Daniel.
you doing anything Friday?
taking a lovely young lady to the philharmonic.
that your way of saying you're having sex with a hooker?
two. Can't create a harmonic with just one.
well, I was hoping you might available for Rachel's simchat bat. It's a...
jewish baby-naming ceremony, a time-honored tradition dating all the way back to the 1960s.
my house at 7: 00.
it'll just be the Rabbi and a few friends and some family.
nothing like welcoming a baby into the world with a completely naked display of hypocrisy.
there'll be plenty of wine and nice people you can quietly mock.
wish I could, but I already put down a deposit on 16 crates of jell-O.
it's one evening. I'd like you to be there.
religious hokum, get sponge bath.
can I get back to you?
can I help you?
just browsing. Thanks.
happy to be underachieving again?
running the E. R.is slacker heaven.
looking for anything in particular?
not anymore. Where's this guy?
Why? - 'Cause he's my next patient.
it'd be rude of me not to introduce myself.
he's a drunk priest who hallucinated Jesus.
afraid you might have missed something?
afraid you're everyone's time?
it's obviously either alcohol or exhaustion.
so you admit you have no idea which?
I admit that I'm too busy to care who you're screwing with.
don't thank me. Just knowing I can be of assistance is thanks enough.
you went out of your way to pick him?
this is nothing. - There are no small cases.
any guesses where this joke is going?
could be psychomotor epilepsy... - could be alcohol.
shouldn't we let the E. R. rule the obvious out
could be atropine toxicity, occipital lobe tumor.
you know something about this case you're not telling us?
why would you think that?
cause you want to screw with us.
or screw with a hallucinating priest.
both are possible. There's only one way to find out.
run an E. E.G. For epilepsy. C. T. His brain for tumors.
and go check his house of god for toxins.
fourteen, hold up.
this department is broken, and I'm not gonna take a real case until it's fixed.
job or relationship-- your choice.
what?
to put iin terms you might better understand, if you don't split, you must quit.
the drug trial is over. Me out, she's out.
don't care.
we're adults. We can handle this. You just have to give us a chance.
no, you're not. No, you can't. And no, I don't.
mull it over. You got until the end of this fake case to decide.
I wasn't drunk.
I had one or two drinks.
people often underestimate alcohol's effect on their
I was on my way to six. I know how alcohol affects me. This wasn't the alcohol.
you lived in Manhattan for three years.
then a year in Oregon, 18 months in new Mexico, less than a year in Wisconsin, and now you've been living in Trenton for the last six months.
Yep.
the more we know about you, the more likely it is we can help you.
mm, it's not medically relevant, so
no way to know unless you went to medical school.
four years ago, a teen in a youth group at my church accused me of inappropriate contact.
I was innocent, but the church decided to transfer me.
said it would be easierfor all involved.
when the parishioners at the new church got wind of why I'd been transferred, they were unhappy.
I was sent off again and again, and how is any of that medically relevant?
so the kid lied?
he was confused.
confused whether you molested him or not?
okay, you wanted to know why I moved around so much, and I told you.
how about telling me why I was hallucinating?
syphilis could explain the hallucination.
I'm not sexually active.
you don't have to admit you did anything with the kid. You weren't always a priest.
I wanted to be since I was 12. I entered the seminary when I was 17.
maybe it wasn't a hallucination. Maybe it really was Jesus.
I'm not insane.
seeing Jesus makes you insane?
a bit of an odd attitude coming from a priest.
well, it's just a job now. The fairy tale ended a long time ago.
you're a wuss--part wimp, part puss.
I have no choice. I'm part of the ceremony.
I thought you were already circumcised.
it's one night for a friend.
what about the friend who has two tickets to see Brubeck at the blue note?
I thought you had an orgy planned. - I lied.
are you lying about the Brubeck tickets?
Yes, but only to save you from yourself.
I'll be fine and so will Cuddy if you don't show up.
I'm surprised she even invited you.
it is oddly flattering.
God, I'm so sick of his stupid stunts.
everybody has to put up with their boss's stupid stunts.
no, they don't.
there's H. R. There're Cuddy. There's other jobs.
house doesn't listen to H. R.
Cuddy will let him fire us before she fires him, and I don't want another job.
why do you clinging him? Why do you defend him?
just because I don't want to be unemployed doesn't mean I'm codependent.
I'm not saying you're codependent. I'm saying you're scared.
you know what?
you're right.
so you want to quit?
no, I want to stop a stupid stunt.
house doesn't want either one of us to quit. He wants this.
he's got two lab rats in a maze and thrown in one piece of cheese.
S--so what do we do?
nothing.
cool. - It's cool he's a child molester?
it's cool the priest doesn't believe in god.
it's cool that god did to him what he did to the kid.
allegedly.
you think he's innocent? - He had honest eyes?
and you think he's guilty, which explains why you're dying to discharge him.
I'm dying to discharge him because he's not sick, not because he's a pedophile.
allegedly.
you actually believe the kid got confused?
if everybody lies, that includes teenage boys.
aren't we luck to have such an interesting patient?
Had--there's nothing wrong with him.
the world's most boring case just became a page turner.
you want to tear out the last chapter?
you want to examine his character, go to a soup kitchen.
we are done testing him for things he doesn't have.
bad news for Foreman and thirteen.
case is over. - We're not splitting up.
so which one of you is taking a hike?
and neither of us is quitting.
interesting.
you were fine with Chase and Cameron dating.
you obviously don't actually have an issue-- - you're fired.
how long are you gonna keep this up? We know you're not wrong again.
in fact, in the last few weeks, it's hard to remember a correct call you made.
if Chase had compromised his professional judgment to help Cameron, I'd have fired his ass, too.
when my mistake blew up, you did everything to keep me from contacting the drug company.
to save your lense, not your job and definitely not your relationship.
so, badge.
fine.
why don't you see if you can find us a real case?
how can you discharge me when you have no idea what's wrong?
we know what's wrong, and now that you've slept it off...
it's not just a hallucination.
I feel nauseous.
my foot feels numb like it's fallen asleep.
you didn't mention that before.
I didn't notice it before.
are you hiding from someone?
why are you so intent on staying here?
I don't feel well. I know there's something wrong with me.
which foot?
my left.
Oh, god.
what the hell is that? What is that?
your toe just fell off.
must be my lucky day.
new symptom means the dsymptom was a real symptom, and I get to keep our pederast priest after all.
where are Foreman and thirteen?
they left.
leprosy can cause necrosis and hallucination.
why would they leave?
because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and thirteen is mad that I fired him.
don't worry. She'll be back. She'll be pissed off. She'll want to take a stand.
and then Foreman will convince her that there's no reason both of them should be out of a job.
Leprosy's a bad fit.
why'd you fire Foreman?
I gave him a choice-- split or quit.
he chose neither.
what about ergotism?
he's giving up his career for her?
he's giving up this career for her.
no, normal white blood count.
carbon monoxide poisoning?
they're good doctors.
separately, they're great doctors, better than you.
together, they're morons.
go check out the house that they would've checked had this been a real case.
and page thirteen. Tell her to run the blood for c-O.
and get the priest in a hyperbaric chamber before anything else falls off.
so what are we gonna do now?
I get a letter of recommendation from Cuddy an find a new job.
Oh, that's it? You're just gonna give up?
house is right.
our relationship did affect my judgment.
then I should quit.
it'll be easier for me to find another job.
not like this one.
we should both quit.
what's that gonna accomplish?
don't worry.
I'll be fine.
we'll be fine.
go ahead.
I'll see you tonight? - I'll be home early.
you really think house is done with Foreman?
if you ask me, Foreman should be done with thirteen.
he's not gonna get a better job, which means he'll end up resenting her for losing this one, which she'll end up resenting.
or the hardship'll bring 'em closer together.
she'll invite friends over for Foreman to share.
no leaks in the heater.
she's not a nympho.
she's bisexual, which, by the way, means she'accustomed to partners who don't need a map to find the treasure.
c-o poisoning might have come from these cigarettes.
not unless he was smoking them in a bell jar.
and even if you know where the treasure is, it can still be pretty hard to dig it up without a shovel.
you can buy a shovel.
let's see...
how do I keep house from ruining my precious display of religious hypocrisy?
I know, I'll pressure him to attend, knowing that he'll never agree to anythingI actually want him to do.
I didn't pressure you. I invited you.
and there's nothing hypocritical about recognizing your heritage.
so you keeping kosher now, wearing four-cornered garments, slaughtering heifers to the god ra?
wait, is that one your people?
do it all, do nothing, or option "c"-- you're a liar and a hypocrite.
for better or for worse, you are a part of my life.
it isn't a ploy. It's a sincere invitation.
I honestly want you to come.
wouldn't miss it for the world.
I'm glad.
you idiot.
I was free and clear.
now he's coming, and it's your fault.
since when have your failed attempts at communication through lies become my fault?
since you forgot how to keep your mouth shut.
you messed it up, and now you're gonna fix it.
and you're gonna keep my name out of it.
how is he?
stable. Necrosis doesn't look to be spreading.
I was talking about Foreman.
is he really gonna leave?
that's usually what people do when they get fired.
why are you biting my head off? I was just wondering what he was gonna do.
you're right. I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
it's not House's fault either.
he gave you guys a chance, you blew it.
uh, he didn't give us a chance, he gave us an ultimatum.
I would've thought five years here would buy a mistake or two.
help me!
help me!
I can't breathe! Feels like something's on my chest!
looks like a heart attack.
I assume you've heard.
I can't override him.
I'm not asking you to override him.
I'm asking for a letter of recommendation.
Eric, the reality here is House should've fired you.
you falsified medical records, put this hospital's reputation in jeopardy.
you're lucky you still have a license.
I can't get a decent position at another hospital without a recommendation.
I'm sorry.
chest pain wasn't angina. Ekg ruled out heart attack.
so the good news is, he didn't have a heart attack.
the bad news is, I apparently fired the only guy who actually knows what a heart attack looks like.
so the man of god who doesn't believe in god had a heart attack that isn't a heart attack.
do I know how to pick awesome cases or what?
could be a clotting disorder.
three different symptoms, three different clots?
I know. How cool is that?
you two do an angio.
you don't want to work, so why don't you just go get me a lottery ticket?
the sicker he gets, the luckier I feel.
where are you going?
I've been wanting to introduce myself.
are you really a virgin?
you have to treat me. You don't have to believe me.
and before we treat you, we have to diagnose you.
not knowing whether we can believe you is making that difficult.
everything I've told you is true.
you lost your faith because a teenager got confused?
and the church abandoned me, and my god forsook me, and I couldn't come up with a reason why god would do that.
God gave the church and the kid free will.
their exercise of that free will hurt you.
means you're just a victim of god's gift to mankind.
Oh, yeah. God wants life to have meaning. Life's meaningless without free will.
with free will, there's always suffering. So god wants suffering.
I got tired of that argument before I even finished saying it.
and even if I bought that, what the hell is god doing?
just the big stuff?
the acts of god, the hurricanes, the earthquakes, the random killings of millions of innocent people.
then we better damn pray.
God, I wish you weren'ta pedophile.
lungs are clean. No embolism. No pleurisy, no pneumonia.
I'm sorry. This is gonna hurt.
no, it's fine.
no pain at all? - No. Why?
because there should be. You feel that?
no.
regional anesthesia is a new symptom.
not if the chest painis related to the numbness.
it's not circulatory. It's neurological.
run a nerve-conduction study. And be careful.
if you kill him, he'll be dancing with the dark one.
why the hell are you going to Cuddy's baby naming?
it's a religious ceremony. It's boring.
why waste a good evening that could be much better spent in a drunken stupor feeling sorry for yourself?
okay. - Okay? Okay, you won't go?
okay, your obligation to Cuddy is fulfilled.
why are you doing this?
why did Hillary conquer Everest?
you always have a reason. It's usually a bad one, but a reason.
she's being childish.
see, that's an example from the bad category.
is it resentment?
the stork brought home a new baby, and you don't want to share mommy?
or you just can't stand to see others happy?
she's trying to play me.
if I let her succeed, the terrorists win.
I heard there might be an opening in the E. R.
Foreman's a neurologist. That's not where he
I did an E. R.Rotation in Miami.
if I can find another position, I figure house will rehire Foreman.
don't quit.
Cuddy wouldn't give Foreman a recommendation.
he's not gonna be able to find a decent job.
foreman shouldn't leave either.
you think they should split up?
office romances are a bad idea.
we beat some very long odds.
wow, why don't you save the gushy stuff for the wedding?
house is playing with you.
if you let him get away with it, he's not gonna respect you anyway.
or House is helping you. He knows it probably won't work out.
and he's actually doing you a favor.
Yeah, that sounds a lot more like House.
I know they're looking for someone at mercy. I'll make a call.
your boss always like that?
usually worse. Finding a fellow aeist always makes his day.
think it's possible maybe god's testing your faith?
no, I already failed.
there'd be no point in what he's doing to me now.
got something. Looks like inter costal neuralgia.
what's that?
something's traumatizing one of the nerves that runs along your ribs.
explains the chest pain and numbness. Could also cause muscle atrophy.
does it do anything to the eyes? - Wh what's wrong?
are you seeing Jesus again?
I'm seeing nothing.
ophthalmological exam's normal.
nothing structurally wrong with the eye.
his heart rate's down.
sensory loss is becoming more diffuse, progressive muscle weakness--he's shutting down.
it's got to be something systemic, like autoimmune.
CSF was clear for guillain-barre.
cancer?
imaging studies have been clear for tumors.
then that leaves infection.
he'd be brimming with white blood cells.
or we are at the back stage door of a duran duran concert.
hundreds of screaming girls clustered around.
what does that mean?
that girls like rock bands.
the presence of the fans indicates the presence of the band.
different night-- sa band, same door.
now there's not a girl in sight.
what does that mean?
sorry, I don't speak hair band.
they weren't a hair band. They were new romantics.
the band already left?
Nope, the band's still there, still rocking out.
when does the absence of the fans not indicate the absence of the band?
when it's 2009.
there aren't any duran duran fans.
they don't make them anymore.
if there's no infection, it's because there aren't any fans, no white cells.
you think his spleen?
why do I bother with these great metaphors if I still have to spell it out?
Yes, I think it's his spleen.
go get a biopsy.
I'll try to get new moon on monday out of my head.
why are you talking this time?
if I quit, will you rehire Foreman?
Why?
he can't find another job.
I can.
and you're willing to make that sacrifice for him?
Yes.
does Foreman know about this plan?
Yes.
well, if he's okay with it, who am I to say no?
hold still.
you think it's my spleen?
that's what they're testing.
so if I happen to cure you, what happens then?
you start thinking that god was working through me?
this is some sort of miracle?
do you think I'm an idiot?
that's what I'm testing.
losing my faith wasn't a choice I made.
it happened. It's gone for good.
but if it can magically disappear, it can magically reappear, and that's what you're hoping.
your job...sucks.
that's my point.
you can make more money frapping decafs, and yet you're still ministering to the meek.
why do the lord's work if the lord has left the building?
I've been with the church my entire adult life.
it's my only marketable skill.
I detect t stink of leftover faith.
you want to talk hypocrisy, what about you?
you act like you don't care about anyone, but here you are saving lives.
solving puzzles.
saving lives is just collateral damage.
Yeah, nice try.
I don't think you're looking for somebody to prove you right.
I think you're looking for somebody to prove you wrong, to give you hope.
you want to believe, don't you?
Yeah, I want to walk out and find myself in a forest of whore trees, but I don't think it's a good idea to tell people to go fornicate with fruit.
Hey, I was just talking about you...
not you specifically--whores and hypocrisy.
you were right.
I don't want you there.
it's a special occasion filled with love and acceptance, and the last thing I need is someone there who's filled with loathing and contempt.
okay.
that's it?
you're really not coming?
I'm really not coming.
thank you.
you're welcome.
gosh, I feel so grown up.
he's obviously just jerking you around, wants to see if you're serious.
if you just stick it out, I think he'll bring Foreman back.
I don't, and even if I'm wrong, I think you should still split up.
it's just a matter of time before one of you finds the other in bed with another woman.
this coming from the relationship expert.
12 years and counting.
Hey, if you can make it that long, then anyone can.
funny how the two people in the room who think relationships are easy are both single.
I don't think they're easy.
that's why I think if you find something that could be good, you should hang onto it.
everything could be good.
very lite ever is.
his spleen is fine, just some insignificant traces of minor bugs.
nothing that'd make him sick.
which minor bugs?
why do people suddenly find religion when they have kids?
fear of the unknown.
cornerstone of faith.
I think it makes perfect sense.
so it makes sense because it doesn't make sense.
the fact that you're railing about it doesn't make a lot of sense.
you really got a thing for your boss, huh?
I've got a thing for my boss's thing.
she doesn't have a thing...per se.
I'm big on metaphors.
what about you?
29 years of celibacy.
what's holding you back now?
who wants a relationship with a priest?
who wants a relationship?
it's the holy water.
we assumed if it was an infection, it had to be something big and nasty.
but he has pneumocystis, a harmless bug that's everywhere and never makes anyone sick, unless they have a compromised immune system.
so father Nietzsche has aids.
impossible.
I've never had a blood transfusion.
I've never done I. V.Drugs.
I've never had sex.
so prove it. Have an aids test.
no.
I know I don't have aids.
we can't treat you until we know what it is.
a negative result proves nothing.
on the off chance it's a false positive, I permanently loseany credibility I have left.
I'd say you just lost that.
I'd say I lost that with you a long time ago.
we should start treatment for aids.
we need to be sure.
the antiretrovirals could fry his heart, his liver, his kidneys.
I'm willing to take that chance.
big of you.
I'm more worried about the kid he molested.
we should be finding him and getting him tested.
you don't think he already got tested?
maybe he did, maybe he didn't, but that's a chance I'm not willing to take.
legally, we can't inform sexual partners about stds.
this isn't some middle-aged barfly who likes it bareback.
this is an innocent kid who was molested.
you just want to rub the priest's face in it, get him transferred again.
Yeah, heaven forbid a diddler has job issues.
and you get brought upon charges.
I've lost enough doctors this week.
treat him for aids.
I found a job.
I didn't know you were looking.
eggers at Mercy says I can start monday.
why would you
house says if I go, you can come back.
it's been less than two days.
give up on me that fast?
you get a job behind my back?
you're acting like I'm cheating on you.
I said I would handle this.
house knew you'd be like this.
I guess House knows me better than you do.
too bad I don't go both ways.
good night.
don't you hate when they put the mushrooms underneath the cheese?
your attendance is validating her hypocrisy.
if she invited you to a ceremonial lynching, would you go?
it would depend on what she was serving.
everyone's a hypocrite.
why are you suddenly so obsessed with Cuddy's particular brand?
just making conversation.
would you rather we go back to talking about mushrooms and cheese?
you're the hypocrite!
you want to go!
you don't resent this baby.
you want to be a part of it.
Yes, but not until her 16th birthday...in some states.
this is ridiculous.
you two deserve each other.
if you want to go, just go and act like a human being.
wow, solid advice, except for two things.
I'm acting like I don't want to go because I don't want to go, and...
I am incapable of acting like a human being.
Yeah.
I'm Dr. Chris Taub.
can we talk?
Yeah.
what's wrong?
uh, in private?
nobody's listening to us here.
um, I work at Princeton Plainsboro Hospital.
I have some news about father Daniel Bresson.
what about him?
uh, we believe he has aids.
okay, so?
Well...uh, given the incident four years ago,
I think you should be tested, unless you've already done so.
how sick is he?
very.
okay. Well, um, thanks.
have you been tested?
uh, yeah.
And?
and it really isn't any of your business.
I want my job back.
love, sacrifice, deception, and now betrayal.
this is better than a telenovela.
what going on?
Well...either Foreman is here, as the two of you discussed, to beg for his job back in exchange for me dumping you, or...nothing.
you're trying to get me fired?
I'm suggesting you quit and I stay, which is exactly what you suggested last night.
I told Eggers I didn't want the job.
find another one.
only took you eight hours to find that one.
the point is, why didn't you tell me you were doing this?
why are you here without me?
you're overreacting.
we'll talk about this later.
Oh, that's what this is about.
it's about you taking control.
it's about you not being able to handle me saving your ass.
and you're not being controlling right now?
Yeah!
who's the controlling bitch now?
house, shut up.
you never wanted to take that other job.
you never wanted to save me.
you wanted to offer to save me so you wouldn't feel guilty.
you knew I'd say no.
that's why you're so mad right now.
you're an idiot.
well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back.
welcome back.
aids meds aren't gonna work.
if you'd let us do a test, we could stop treating you, or you could stop lying.
I know the feeling.
bp's climbing.
you feeling okay?
no, I feel flushed.
Ah, I'm burning all over.
Ah, my chest.
it's not a new symptom.
it's just a reaction to the aids meds.
he reacted by getting worse.
means it's not aids.
so went Satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote Job sore with boils.
you think it's hyper-ige syndrome?
I prefer the colloquial term "Job syndrome.
explains the symptoms and my quote.
that's the first thing I checked.
ige levels are normal.
could be some other genetic disorder.
cerebral microtumors could explain the blindness and the hallucinations.
we didn't find any tumors.
that's why I didn't say "tumors.
I said "microtumors.
so your explanation doesn't depend on us being major morons, just morons?
we should start genetic testing.
it takes too long.
so we start treatment.
treatment is surgery.
we can't open him up without confirmation.
so your position is we can't test and we can't treat?
my position is you're wrong.
this isn't gonna work.
are you kidding?
I've never felt more alive.
conflict breeds creativity.
go run the genetic tests.
on it.
so now you don't think I have aids?
I still think it's aids.
on the off chance it isn't, we're pursuing other avenues.
he's, um...he's dying?
uh, we don't know what's wrong with him.
can I speak to him?
I don't think that's a good idea.
um, why don't I get you
come on, Ryan, now's not a good ti
I'm sorry for everything.
I'm sorry.
I know. I know.
any second thoughts about Cuddy?
Nope.
but please, feel free to blather on.
raising a child on her own is scary.
she's just doing what you do, what everyone does-- trying to avoid pain.
religion is not the opiate of the masses.
religion is the placeboof the masses.
if you're saying she's not a hypocrite
I'm not.
I'm trying to give you a rational reason to overlook her hypocrisy so you don't feel like a hypocrite for going.
Oh, sorry.
continue.
okay, even if an absolute truth exists, we can't know all of it, and you can't condemn her for recognizing that.
are you eliminating symptoms?
we can know everything.
this is medicine not metaphysics.
truth is truth.
it fits.
it doesn't fit.
you can't eliminate a symptom.
I can if it's not a symptom.
well, what is it?
not a symptom.
you're not gonna die.
you have Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
it impairs your immune system, makes you susceptible to all the aids stuff without actually having aids.
and you didn't catch it.
you were born with it.
another gift from god.
you sure?
genetic test should confirm it, but it explains all your symptoms-- toe, chest, eyes, skin.
what about my hallucination?
scotch explains that.
but that was just a coincidence.
coincidences do happen.
that coincidence is what brought me to you in the first place.
you promised you wouldn't go there.
einstein said,"coincidence is god's way of remaining anonymous.
a woman in Florida said,"look, Jesus is on my cheese sandwich.
you didn't even want to take my case.
you didn't even think I was sick.
the fact that I was wrong is not a proof of god.
I'm just trying to understand how my life could completely turn around in a single day.
don't worry.
your life will go back to sucking soon enough.
everything that happened to you can be rationally explained.
I know.
it's just that's a lot of coincidences.
house was right about the priest.
genetic test confirmed it was wiskott-aldrich.
and I would've discharged him.
everybody would've discharged him, House included.
he only took that case as a stall.
and yet it was a real case, and he solved it.
but by violating his own principles and ignoring the admitting symptoms.
still he somehow got away with it.
saved another life.
you want him there tonight.
you should tell him.
it's--it's cold out there.
at least you have shoes that cover your toes.
so it's tonight?
Yep.
bad weather for it, hu maybe you'll get lucky.
maybe your sister will decide the roads are too dangerous to drive on.
fingers crossed.
have fun.
Cuddy Serenade
I want to reassure you.
your child can have a completely normal life.
how can a baby have male and female DNA?
it's a condition called genetic mosaicism.
the ambiguous genitalia can be surgically repaired.
repaired?
made to look more... typical.
more typical?
but you haven't even told us if the baby's a boy or a girl.
that's... that's a choice you have to make.
nice job, Jackson!
take it.
he had the shot. He lost his nerve.
honey, it's okay. He's doing great.
three.
no fear that time.
Oh, my god. Jackson!
black heels or the boots?
you know I'm a fan of those heels.
boots it is.
for all we know, House knows you're a fan of those heels.
you think House is gonna figure out we faked our break-up because of your shoes?
go with the boots.
gonna eat that?
have at it.
did you just ask my permission before you took my food?
Yes, we can.
adolescent genetic mosaic collapsed during a basketball game.
presenting with persistent pelvic pain.
fun.
the parents haven't told their son that he could've been their daughter.
they want assurance that you won't either.
less fun, but still.
that was easy.
our new patient. Part girl, part boy.
all 13's dream date.
severe pelvic pain started during a basketball game.
could be dehydration.
er gave him fluids when he came in.
still it feels chronic.
we've got a kid who could mate with himself, and we think he didn't have enough to drink?
there are dozens of intersex disorders.
persistent pelvic pain could mean congenital adrenal hyperplasia, PMBS
those conditions occur in intersex kids who are chromosomally xx or xy.
not xx and xy.
parents recently started him on testosterone. Maybe there's some
vitamins wouldn't cause pelvic pain.
there's a note in here. We're supposed to refer to his testosterone shots as vitamins.
his parents aren't just liars. They want us to be liars too.
I won't do it. You guys will, though.
he's a kid. Parents don't think he's ready to deal with it.
my dad was the same way about me maybe having huntington's.
well, that was your experience.
it should surely apply in this situation.
pain could be caused by a blind uterus hidden in his abdomen.
he needs an MRI.
right. Boy with girl genes.
I'm sure you're the first doctor brilliant enough to check for a uterus.
he could have complications from the surgeries on his penis.
that can cause pelvic pain.
way to multi-task. Impress your boss and humiliate your ex.
MRI is a waste of time.
to continue the humiliation, you'll put a camera up his penis.
you're dr. House, aren't you?
what do you think's wrong with our son?
these people were just coming to tell you.
this is better. Don't have to worry about them losing their way.
we think that he has a blind uterus.
he should have an MRI.
did you send 'em a text?
over the past 13 years, we've educated ourselves.
who needs med school when you got wi-fi?
let's schedule their son for an MRI with contrast right away.
thank you. - Thanks.
you said an MRI was a waste of time.
so is arguing with them.
contrast's in.
Jackson, we're gonna get started, so try to lie still.
how long do you think the post-break-up awkwardness is gonna last?
foreman and I are both professionals.
stomach and liver are clear.
if by professional you mean he's a t-1000 build by cyber dyne systems.
I never understood what you saw in him.
he's not really your type, huh?
moving down through the pelvic floor.
here's my impression of Foreman on the happiest day of his life.
now the saddest day of his life.
we just broke up, I'm not quite ready to mock him yet.
house was a jerk to split you two up.
but, bottom line, he did you a favor.
area around the intestinal tract is clear. No blind uterus.
I think there's something wrong with House.
who's he making miserable now?
actually no one.
he okay'd an MRI just because the parents wanted to look for a blind uterus.
there was no fighting, no arguing. He just went along.
it's a valid medical theory. - He doesn't think it is.
house decided to humor these parents.
maybe he had a great cup of coffee.
or a tremendous bowel movement.
bottom line is your boss is in a good mood.
stop analyzing it and just enjoy it.
we're gonna use this scope to fill your bladder with saline.
then examine your urethra for any narrow spots.
why would there be a narrow spot?
sometimes it just happens.
can my parents come in? - Sure.
I thought it'd be awkward for you having them here.
I have this feeling they've seen me naked before.
now take a breath. Just try to relax.
mom.
it's okay, honey. It's okay.
Hey, remember those sprints they made you run in practice?
those were so hard. But you pulled through.
you can do this too.
I'm to the bladder. Start the saline.
I'm gonna look around and pull back on the scope.
feels tight. - That pressure's normal.
just try to hold on for a few more minutes.
it's not down there. It's my chest.
can't breathe. Can't bre-- can't breathe.
is he okay? - Muffled heart sounds.
jugular's distended.
pericardial effusion. We need ten gauge on a syringe.
what's happening?
his heart is filling with exudate. If we don't drain it, it'll stop beating
we drained the fluid from his pericardial space.
his heart rate is back to normal.
pelvis plus heart.
doesn't fit with any of the syndromes associated with mosaicism.
could be drugs, toxins, an infection.
you're okay with this? - With what?
that we're considering a diagnosis unrelated to this kid being a shemale.
assuming a coincidence like that would usually torture you but you're completely unfazed.
completely unfazed?
you think I'm totally lacking in any fazing?
the idea that I'm anything less than half-fazed I actually find offensive.
it greatly fazes me.
he started testosterone-- - vitamins. A few months ago. That can cause autoimmune diseases like polyarteritis and SLE which can cause pericardial effusion and pelvic pain.
so it is related.
now I'm unfazed.
start him on corticosteroids for the autoimmune. Finasteride to block the "vitamins."
you slept with House.
he asked permission before taking my bagel.
took the case without a fight.
honored the parents' request for an MRI.
Yes, those were my terms for sleeping with him.
he's in a good mood.
sex with me would explain that.
but it doesn't explain why I'm not curled up in a ball weeping in shame.
I did not have sex with House.
if you two aren't keeping something from me, that means he's keeping something from both of us.
that can't be good. - Or he's just in a good mood. This is not a crisis.
maybe you can get back some of that money he owes you.
testosterone blocker?
does that mean if Jackson has SLE or whatever that other thing was, that he'd had to go off the hormones?
probably.
then Jackson'll stop developing.
he'll never go through puberty.
maybe this isn't what's wrong with him.
maybe the testosterone didn't cause it.
Yeah, but if it is, then he'll never be a man.
did we make the wrong choice?
you'll need to tell him the testosterone blocker is something else.
or maybe this is a good opportunity to tell him the truth.
it might make it simpler. For all of you.
you want us to tell a sick adolescent boy that he's really not an adolescent boy?
that... doesn't seem simpler to me.
no. Just...
give him the meds.
so you have pain in one arm and both your legs.
does it hurt right now?
no. It's when I, like, put pressure on them.
see... it hurts when I do this.
and this.
and this.
what about this?
did you give House the moron with the broken finger?
they've been in room two about ten minutes.
patient should've been screaming for another doctor seven minutes ago.
Thanks, brah.
if I have this IV, why do I need a shot too?
just some extra medicine. Just to be safe.
I hear you're quite the basketball player. What position?
point guard. - Small forward.
how's your crossover dribble?
it's okay. Not really that into basketball.
gonna feel a little pinch, okay?
so if you're not that into it, why did you join the team?
my mom kind of made me do it.
my parents were the same way.
always pushing me to try new things.
it's more like what she didn't want me to try.
I-- I wanted to take dance.
she flipped out and made me choose between basketball and hockey.
what does your dad say?
he seemed okay with it.
then he just caved into my mom.
your palm is red.
what does that mean?
that we still don't know what's wrong with you.
you were right. He is in a good mood.
bummer it didn't work out with you and thirteen.
it happens.
you guys seemed happy together.
it's probably for the best. You know, the bisexual thing and all.
it was never an issue.
no, it never is. Until it is.
this is thirteen.
before you guys got together, she was hooking up with a different girl every night.
long term, you really think you could compete with that?
house, wake up. We have to talk.
stop pretending to be asleep. We're not leaving.
what's going on?
he's not breathing. - Can you get a pulse?
barely. - Call a code.
get an ambu bag from the nurse's station.
heart still working means synapses are still firing.
we just need to get a message through.
you stopped breathing.
what the hell is going on?
I think my penis stopped breathing. Do you know CPR?
looks like your brainis okay. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive.
I'm fine.
other than the fact that my nurple is now purple.
no wonder you broke up with him. I'm surprised yours are still attached.
by the way, I could see that from here.
I assume those are our patient's lab results.
the patient can wait. You could've died.
the only reason you'd ignore a near-death experience is you don't care or you already know why it happened.
it's called vicodin. I took too many.
can I please get some information about our patient?
patient's palms are red. Lab tests confirmed liver and kidney dysfunction.
I don't remember you taking any vicodin today.
I don't remember hiring my mother.
what causes the enzymes in little boy george's existing heart problem and pelvic pain?
you didn't take any yesterday at breakfast either.
I don't remember having breakfast with my mother.
amyloidosis with systemic involvement.
protein levels are normal. This kid's depressed.
if he's self-medicating with drugs and alcohol, that'd explain his symptoms.
search the school. Search the home.
Seriously? Or are you just deflecting? - Both.
where are you going? - Nowhere. I'm staying right here.
so we can properly discuss this.
he's on heroin. - How can you
number one-- he's happy, which means he's high.
number two--when he moved his bad leg, he didn't use his hands to support it.
whatever he's taking, it's stronger than vicodin.
what are we gonna do?
took too many vicodin?
guy pops 'em like candy.
I'm surprised it hasn't happened before.
you miss sleeping with women?
excuse me?
simple question.
Yes. It's a simple answer.
I'll... check under the bed.
I also miss sleeping with other men.
and I'm sure you miss sleeping with other women.
monogamy is you're never gonna have any other ice cream flavor besides rocky road.
so you're saying if you don't have pink bubble gum for a while, that one day you're gonna chase down the ice cream truck?
no. Rocky road is great.
it's a very delicious and complicated flavor.
I also know that if I have other flavors, then rocky road is gonna be left in the freezer where anyone can just dip in.
can we please drop the metaphor?
why is this coming up now?
Kutner said the silver lining of our break-up was I wouldn't be dumped for a girl.
there's nothing in here either.
seems like you're wrong about this kid having drug or alcohol
when did he bring that up?
earlier today. Right before
this morning taub called you a robot.
either it's a big coincidence or...
they're jerking us around. They know.
and if they know, House knows.
this is bad.
no. This is good.
house only has two ways to handle us still going out.
he jerks us around or he fires us.
he chose option A.
this is good.
but this is bad.
I stand alone, my soul and me, beneath the mask that others... see.
his chest is still rising.
he's just screwing with me cause cuddy made me babysit.
a pain that tears and bites and will not bend. Only when I sleep will it end.
downer.
and medically irrelevant...
you sure his chest is moving?
if he's faking, you think he's gonna come clean cause you said his name?
back off.
only thirteen gets to grab my nipples this time.
you know, recreating the moment when you made us crap our pants isn't actually all that funny.
that is sweet that you're worried about House.
unless the next anza reads "hoping to fry my brain to death,
I smoked some primo crystal meth," I'm not interested.
you can't deny that this kid may be suicidal.
we're not here to make him happy. We're here to diagnose him.
it's an infection.
swab of the kid's water bottle turned up toxoplasmosis.
I'll start him on pyrimethamine.
I had no idea he felt this way.
is there a therapist here that you can recommend?
it might help more if you talked to him.
he's not ready.
if telling him the truth would help him stop feeling like this
if I knew that it would make him less confused, I'd tell him right now.
but if she's wrong, we'd only make things worse.
he obviously senses he's different.
he's looking for answers.
every teenager feels different.
he's sick. This isn't the time to spring this on him.
okay.
when you give Jackson the antibiotics, will you please restart the testosterone?
sure.
I get House wanting to jerk me and thirteen around, but you guys?
told you they were still together.
how do you know?
noticed you smell like thirteen's soap every morning.
you figured it out? - Yes, I'm a little slow.
maybe someone should let me know when I should be insulted.
then House doesn't know.
probably does now that you felt her up during that last differential.
you noticed this but House didn't?
Yes, I get it. He's generally smarter than me.
can we please move on? - He's not generally smarter than you. He's always smarter than you.
unless...
hello. - House is on heroin.
well, that's certainly an... interesting notion.
it's why his lungs stopped. It's why he okay'd the mri. It's why he missed...
things he wouldn't ordinarily miss.
um, we'll run some tests and I'll let you know.
he's there, isn't he?
well, that would certainly explain the inappropriate responses.
I--I gotta go. Okay.
sorry. A consult.
when did you order these?
when you were in the bathroom. I thought a celebration was in order.
to cheating death.
you off bourbon? We can get you something else.
I came here expecting a burger.
figured I'd have to endure a little lecture on moderation.
you never listen, so why？
instead, I get a drink.
nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lungs stopped working.
you seem fine now.
you don't believe that I overrate vicodin.
you figure I'm on something stronger.
and because you can never, ever assume anything but the most screwed-up scenarios, - as far as I'm concerned-- - funny how I'm usually right.
you think that I'm on heroin.
this is your version of a tox screen.
because if I am on heroin, I can't drink that without risking another boutof not breathing.
well?
good night.
another shot?
I'm afraid so.
that looks like the vitamins my parents give me. Same red top.
these aren't vitamins.
what is it?
I can't tell you that. You should ask your parents.
you idiot!
okay, I admit it. I have bulimia.
I look good though, don't I? - Heroin.
heroin! House, of all the stupid
I'm not on heroin.
I just caught you with your fingers down your throat.
I'm on methadone.
stupid product. Heroin without the high.
Yeah, and twice the risk of death.
but no risk of arrest.
you nearly died.
today was a fluke. I nodded off.
right. You're safe as longas you never sleep again.
Mistime your dose, you die.
couple of drinks, you die.
mix it with the wrong drugs, you die.
you want to detox from vicodin?
pick something that won't kill you.
I'm not detoxing.
if you're looking for something to help with your pain
doesn't help my pain. It eliminates it.
my leg doesn't hurt anymore.
she completely disregarded our instructions.
he asked a question. I was tired of lying.
I didn't tell him anything about his genetic condition.
I want her removed from our son's case.
I'm sorry for the position dr. Hadley put you in, but I can't do that.
she's a valuable part of dr. House's diagnostic team.
if he stays on the case, so does she.
we have to deal with Jackson.
these questions aren't gonna go away.
he's not ready for this.
let's hope you're wrong.
I'm sorry. I'll stay away from their son.
no, you won't.
in about 15 minutes, you're the only person that kid's gonna trust.
if he needs a hand to hold, make sure yours is available.
so what? Am I a boy or a girl?
some of your cells are male...
and some are female.
so basically I'm a freak.
no, no, buddy.
you're just a little different.
you've known this... since I was born. And you never told me.
we didn't want you to be confused.
so you lied to me.
Oh, please, sweetie, we were just trying to protect you.
don't. Just leave me alone.
get out.
let's go.
you still breathing in there?
cause if not, I'm sending in janitorial.
I'm not breathing. But it's strictly voluntary.
should've seen the guy who was in here before me.
I know about the methadone.
it's legal. I have a prescription.
whatever doctor you conned into writing it clearly had no idea about your addiction issues.
your lack of-- - he knows I'm in pain.
what I put in my body is my business.
you keep taking this, you could die.
if you'd said that if I keep doing this you could die, then it'd be your business.
I can't sit by and watch you kill yourself.
as long as you're in my hospital, you can't do methadone.
I'll send someone for my stuff.
that's it? You're quitting? You're choosing methadone over this job?
I'm choosing lack of pain over this job.
eventually you have to talk to your parents again.
no, I don't.
I have this one friend.
he's on my basketball team. Will.
we hang out a lot. I really like him. Now I'm worried that I...
you know, like him.
maybe I'm supposed to.
because if I'm really a girl...
do you feel like a girl?
I like dancing more than basketball. Is that what that means?
as hard as it is right now, at least it's out in the open.
you don't have to hide behind a mask.
I found the poem you wrote in your room.
no matter how bad things get, killing yourself is never the answer.
this was an english assignment.
we were supposed to write a poem in the style of sylvia plath.
you don't feel this way?
I'm sad sometimes. I don't want to die.
at least, I didn't.
are these antibiotics supposed to make you nauseous?
Yeah, they can.
we're on our own. - Is he okay?
he's fine. He's just not here.
did he quit? Did she suspend him? - She didn't say.
she just told meI was in charge until further notice.
so if we add bloody vomit to our patient's list of symptoms.
surgeon reports the bleeding was caused by a gastric fistula caused by necrotizing pancreatitis.
she must've told you something.
nothing that would help us with this patient.
heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas.
obviously whatever this kid's got is something systemic.
Zollinger-ellison?
or systemic scleroderma.
Zollinger-ellison fits better. - Why?
can we at least call House? - We can. I have. He's not answering.
put the patient on proton pump inhibitors.
if he gets better, it's zollinger-ellison. If not, it's scleroderma.
Zollinger-ellison doesn't fit better.
you don't want it to be scleroderma because that means he's gonna die.
patients die all the time. - Not the ones whose family you've ruined.
I don't think that. You do. It's not your fault.
he was no more confused than any other teenager.
then I started a fire and threw gas on it.
you were trying to help.
Hi, is House here?
he's getting dressed. I'll be back around 10: 00tonight.
go on in. - Okay.
who was she? - I hired her to watch me sleep.
make sure I don't stop breathing.
home nurses usually wear scrubs.
she's not a nurse.
you hired a hooker to watch you sleep? That just can't
surprisingly, hookers are cheaper. And they don't sue for sexual harassment. Which one?
you shaved. - The red one then.
you have two ties?
meeting at st. Sebastian's today. Gonna try and talk 'em into starting upa diagnostics department.
sounds great. I just came by to check up on you.
e how you were doing.
I'm fine.
I guess you are.
he hasn't responded to the medication at all?
I'm afraid not.
so... that means he's got the other thing?
I'm so sorry.
we'll start him on anti-inflammatories.
if we're lucky, that will slow down the progression.
my son has a death sentence and I can't go in there and be with him because of you.
I'm sorry.
you find a homework assignment and decide he's suicidal.
make it your own personal mission.
I let my feelings-- - oh, don't you dare apologize.
like it could absolve you of what you've done to me, my family. He was fine.
I understand why you're angry.
but this isn't where you belong right now.
he won't let us in the room.
he's a teenager. You're his mother.
this is not the time to start listening to him.
go be with him.
thank you.
I didn't do it for you.
we made a mistake.
no, we didn't.
the methadone's good for him. - The methadone is gonna kill him.
he shaved. He was wearing a tie. He has a meeting at st. Sebastian.
if he buys a new pair of shoes, should we let him smoke crack?
Cuddy, he's happy.
house doesn't do happy pain or no pain.
okay, maybe... but he's our friend.
and this is his one chance to not be miserable.
the heels. Very nice.
no reason not to wear them now that House is gone.
you okay? - Yeah. Just tired.
got some good news.
patient's scleroderma is responding to the anti-inflammatory meds.
his ast level's dropped a bit.
so he's dying slightlyless quickly than we thought. That's great news.
I'm not okay.
next time just say that.
what's his ast?
185, I think.
that's a pretty fast drop. Are we sure it's from the anti-inflammatories?
what else could it be from? He's been off the antibiotics for a while.
proton pump inhibitor's-- - he's back on testosterone.
testosterone wouldn't help his liver function.
but it could improve his kidney function which would also lower his ast.
but not in kidneys damaged by scleroderma.
which means it's not scleroderma.
I have an interview in two hours.
hand over my letter of recommendation.
mm, sorry, I haven't done it yet.
you have no right to sabotage-- - I was busy with this.
it's a list of requirements for your methadone treatment.
weekly drug tests.
supervised doses administered on a precise schedule by me or one of the nurses.
seems weird getting my meds here when I'm working somewhere else.
Yes. I'm offering you your job back.
I want a raise. - No.
and a bigger office... but in the same spot. - No.
we both know this is where you belong.
okay.
welcome back.
thank you.
you're welcome.
you okay?
I have issues with authority. You?
we-we thought you were gone.
Cuddy missed me. - And what happened to your cane?
she asked to borrow it for some reason.
patient dead or do I need to do anything?
he's got scleroderma. - It's not scleroderma.
two days, and you've already got two separate theories.
you're back. Good.
we noticed a dropin ast levels. It's not from the anti-inflammatory meds.
it's because his kidneys got better from the testosterone.
which rules out scleroderma.
when did you two come up with this?
we ran into each other in the lobby.
what did we miss?
when I say "we" I mean "you"，since I wasn't here.
we've ruled out zollinger-ellison.
that was a dumb idea. - Why?
because it was wrong.
also toxoplasmosis, dehydration, sle, various intersex disorders.
Oh, crap.
this kid like energy drinks?
I saw some empty bottles in the team locker room.
but energy drinks don't explain-- - nice work.
so... we're okay?
why wouldn't we be?
nice heels.
this is all your parents' fault.
excuse me?
chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice?
your son came in here with simple dehydration.
that's why he collapsed during the game.
the er treated him for that. It didn't help the pain.
that's where the energy drinks came in.
they put a strainon his kidneys so he needed more time to rebound from the initial dehydration.
then why isn't he better?
that's where your idiocy came in.
before we could give him another glass of water, you two insisted I do an mri.
so I go down a blind alley looking for a blind uterus.
and my team injects him with contrast material.
if his kidneys had been healthy, they would've filtered out the contrast in a couple hours.
since they weren't, they went around and around.
eventually getting absorbed by his heart, his liver, d his pancreas, getting in trouble everywhere it went.
your son was fine when he got here.
it was your freaked-out over protectiveness that nearly killed him.
nearly?
he's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.
you gave birthto a freak of nature.
doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one.
how you feeling?
a little bit better.
I saw you talking to your parents earlier. That's good.
my mom asked if I wanted to take dance lessons.
that's great.
I'm actually worried I might miss basketball.
starting to get good.
there's no reason you can't do both.
starting tomorrow, you'll come to my office for your fix.
I'm done with the methadone.
I screwed up.
the kids' parents wanted that MRI.
I knew he didn't need it. I did it anyway.
that's what got him sick.
you just solved a case that no one else could solve.
I created a case.
I played nice because I was in a good mood because I didn't hurt.
you don't need your pain to be a good doctor.
m not interested in good. - You're afraid to be happy.
why do you care if I'm happy?
you're afraid of change.
the one thing you have is your intellect.
you think if that's compromised, you have nothing.
just take it. - No.
don't do this.
it's already done.
this is the only me you get.
am I gonna have to give a speech?
you're the publisher. Can't you do it?
I can warm them up.
but you are gonna have to get over this fear of public speaking before the book tour.
but his patient hand-holding of crazy authors.
you'd think that after three novels, I'd start to develop a little confidence, but...
for a book like this, we are happy to supply the confidence.
best-seller.
well, that's not gonna hapn. - What?
come on. Shorstories don't make money.
short stories weren't making money back in 1908.
you'd have to be mathematically illiterate to think they'd do as well as a novel.
okay, nick, let's step away from the champagne before somebody gets hurt.
you slaved over this book right next to me.
why would northrop even publish it if it's only going to tank?
have you failed to notice you're our star author?
obviously, Elaine wouldn't want to offend you.
uh, honey.
I-I'm sorry. I don't--I don't know why I said that.
he's joking.
Nick knows as well as anyone what you have done is art.
so is folding paper into animal shapes, but you don't expect to make a living off it.
what the hell is wrong with you?
you really think someone who goes through ten assistants a year and doesn't return her own children's phone calls would give a damn about the state of the american short story?
please, be quiet.
I think something's wrong.
that title was a mistake too.
people are gonna compare you to salinger, and, boy, are you gonna come up short on that one.
honey!
call 911. Help! We need help!
cameron brought this up from the E. R.
doesn't look like a friendship bracelet.
it's Phineas Gage.
the most famous case study in medical history.
you're telling me this patient got a railroad spike drilled through his frontal lobe?
no. No trauma, but he does have frontal lobe disinhibition.
just like gage.
gage was a different person after the spike. Argumentative. Impulsive.
whereas our guy became a different person after chardoay.
he was sober when they brought him in.
there's also the nosebleed, the collapse.
MRI show anything? - Nothing.
good.
so the tumor's not in the cool neighborhood.
it's cool neighborhood adjacent.
a well-placed tumor in the nasal cavity eroding into the brain could do the damage.
go stick a scope up phineas's nose. See what you find.
daddy, I'm always gonna win if you keep telling me what your cards are.
well, then suppose I tell you... while I tickle you.
Mr. Greenwald, I'm dr. Taub. Is is dr. Kutner.
we're here for another test. Sorry about that.
you don't look sorry.
um, no offense. Although you do look kind of cheerful.
it's a little creepy. Should I want a doctor who's excited about how sick I am?
I'm not-- - We're going to put this up your nose, scan for any problems.
I can assure you that we are completely unexcited about that.
excuse me, sweetie.
she has an auditory processing disability.
Marika-beleeka, you have to get off the bed.
this might be slightly uncomfortable
honey, do you mind if I step out?
I have to make sure the final arrangements are in place for the breast cancer walk.
Yeah, you do that.
I'll pretend to be macho while a guy stuffs three feet of plastic up my nose.
it's too bad it's not your nose.
lots more room to maneuver.
I guess the walk can wait ten minutes.
or in a sensible world, even longer.
just how does tying up traffic for six hours stop breast cancer?
you know how it works. People donate
why not spend six hours building houses for habitat for humanity?
or is it wrong to help two groups of people at once?
I bet there are those who have breast cancer and no home.
it's my job, nick. You walked yourself last year.
to be supportive.
and because I knew you wouldn't have sex with me if I didn't.
I'm gonna make my call.
make this go away.
God, that honker really is huge, isn't it?
wednesday night.
Low-wn-blue-meanie versus the incinerator.
I can't.
let me rephra. Low-down-blue-meanie
I understand monster truck code.
do you understand "can't"?
not when it follows "low-down-blue-meanie.
is the world coming to an end tuesday night? Otherwise, wednesday
all right, it's not "can't." It's "don't want to.
the fact is I just don like monster trucks.
Yes, you do. - No, I don't.
you've always liked monster trucks.
no, you've always liked them. I've tolerated them.
seriously, I can only watch so many hyped-up dune buggies crush so many motor homes without feeling the urge to go see la boheme.
and I hate opera too.
what are you hiding?
I'm not hiding it. I'm saying it loud and proud.
death to monster trucks. - No nasal cancer.
do not marriage either if our patient keeps saying everything that comes into his head without regard for the consequences.
you always led me to believe you were one of a kind.
luckily jerkiness is a temporary condition for this guy.
no, it's not.
we may be able to fix his impulse to say his thoughts out loud, but he always gonna be the guy who thinks them.
but he's also gonna be the guy who doesn't say them.
if he spent his whole life constructing this nice guy persona, isn't that as much who he really is as anything else?
you would argue that. You're all persona.
I agree with wilson. This guy's aarry potter.
the sorting hat was going to put harry in Slytherin based on his nature.
he refus, so he ended up in Gryffindor.
through choice.
there's damage somewhere in his brain. Find it.
are you sure you understand?
no, I'm lying. Except I can't.
you ask questions.
while I talk, you look at my brain activity to see where it's screwed up.
then you're gonna cut the screwed up part out to test it.
it's depressing, but it's not rocket science.
I think he understands.
I don't mean to be abrasive.
especially since you're such a pleasure to image naked.
ain, sorry. - It's okay.
thank you for understanding.
I'd do you, though.
really, my apologies. This stuff just comes out. - It's okay.
house paged.
whoa, I would do her in a minute with fudge and a cherry on top.
would someone please explain to this woman? There's only so many apologies
he hafrontal lobe disinhibition.
I've already embarrassed myself with one doctor, whom I am at this moment imaginin with you in a king-sized bed with a mirror on the cling.
I am so, so sorry.
but if I couldn't have both of you together, you definitely would be my first choice.
Where's House?
it's like trying not to think of an elephant.
not that you're an elephant. Your breasts, in fact, are all homo sapiens
house isn't here.
Oh, he wouldn't have paged meif he couldn't watch and enjoy the
your tush is like the pistons in a Ferrari.
you're welcome.
that was for my benefit - You're 40 years old... - 38.
the administrator of a hospital...
Dean of medicine. - People don't get personal with you.
except for me, and you dismiss me as a jerk who's jerking you around.
but that guy can only tell the truth.
and he prefers your body to thatof a smokin' young hottie.
so that was your way of saying I look good day.
you didn't get the slightest kick out of that?
don't be ridiculous, House.
I hope you know your pistons are second to none.
I'm okay. I'm not jealous of cuddy's pistons.
starting baseline activation.
you sure? You looked upset.
what he was saying was obnoxious.
you've never been called attractive?
he didn't call me attractive. He cast me in his mental porno.
that's what attractive means. It means "I'm attracted to you, sexually.
attracted can also mean "I'm attracted to the whole package. To who you are.
slight elevation at transaxial 60.
it could. It never does. It's what women choose to hear, not what men say.
actually, it's exactly what men say if they have any brains.
all right, we have enough for a baseline.
what can we ask him that's indiscreet, but that he won't hate us for knowing?
Nick, do you vote the same way as your wife?
God, no.
good. He's spiking at right?
wrong. I secretly don't vote. Ever.
wait, you're 46, and you've never voted?
your voice isno longer attractive to me with that note of disapproval.
although I'm sure that will pass.
look at that. There's a spot in the cingulategyrus that's not lighting up.
one vote makes a difference?
not mathematical true. - Okay, nick. We've got what we need.
we can't biopsy that. It's too close to the brainstem.
could be neurosarcoidosis. At least it's treatable.
so we give him steroids, and we're right, we should start seng his symptoms improve within half a day.
what are you looking at?
I find your strong attachment to a working democracy to be extremely sexy.
Ooh, you smooth talker.
do you think my nose is too big?
relax, he also implied my bedside manner was a lite off. You don't agree with that, right?
no.
no one's ever mentioned your nose before? You're a plastic surgeon.
they tell meit suits my face. - It does.
maybe. Maybe that's just the social contract.
you tell me I look great. I tell you you're a people person.
how can you know the truth?
you could ask for the truth.
what do you think of my nose? Please tell me the truth.
it's fine. It's a nose.
just oving a point.
anyone sitting here?
just my persona.
you know, it's amazing the way people cling on to insults.
or what they think are insults.
so that wasn't an insult?
I'm not suggesting that, like our patient, you're hiding a dark, sarcastic core beneath a candy shell of compulsive nicene.
I'm not always nice. I'm not nice to you.
because you know nice bores me.
hence, still nice.
no, I'm suggesting that you have no core.
yore what whoever you're with needs you to be.
okay, I guess that could be insulting.
the interesting question is why.
why do you thinkthe world will end in chaos and destruction if you're not there to save it?
because when my parents put me in the rocket and sent me here, they said, "james, you will grow to manhood under yellow sun
and why'd you lie about monster trucks?
I didn't. - I checked your appointment book.
you got tomorrow nightmarked off, but you didn't put down what you were doing.
so you thought someone might look at e book
I'm playing racquet ball tomorrow night with taub.
why would you hide that?
because the world revolves around you.
I devote time to anyone else, you'd end up stalking me and harassing them.
you say that as though it wouldn't be fun.
and maybe I didn't want to rub your nose in the fact that we'd be doing so thing you can no longer do.
because I'm nice.
I thought you said thesteroids were gonna help him.
EKG says heart's fine. It's gotta be the kidneys.
I need to get him on dialysis.
he's on dialysis, and he's stable.
we know it's not systemic sclerosis.
Hey, cyrano de berkowitz.
let it go.
chronic lymphocytic leukemia could explain brain and kidney problems.
the CBC showed normal white blood cells.
so how long have you been aying racquetball with wilson?
four five times.
could be diabetes.
or a congenal metabolic disorder.
Cgenital disorders generally don't wait till you're 46 to manifest.
so he's a late bloomer.
his daughter has a neurological condition.
first of all, wilson played tennis on his college team, and you ara jew.
you're not athletic. Run the end of the hall and back. I'll time you.
sandy koufax is jewish.
greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.
sandy koufax is all you jews go on about.
sandy koufax and the holocaust. Gets old.
there are dozens of congenital conditions that fit our parameters.
we can't spend time gene testing for all of 'em, especially when we're only guessing it's congenital.
is a z-shot offensive or defensive?
it's both.
you suspected that was a trick question.
but could have said neither.
diabetes makes more sense.
we can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates.
test for peripheral nerve damage.
he's got brain damage. He's likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause.
Yes, that's why we should not test him for it.
test the daughter.
Kuer runs the nerve test.
Taub, you might be right about the diabetes.
take supper away from our patient and run a glucose tolerance test.
Oh, and the nurses have been working so hard.
you can do the blood draws yourself.
they have to be done every couple hours.
you're punishing me because you're jealous that I'm spending time with your best friend.
that would be petty.
I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me.
let me know when you're ready to confess everything.
the can become either hot or cold.
as soon as it stts to feel uncomfortable, I want you to tell me.
but you don't think there's something wrong with me.
no, baby, they're testing you to help daddy.
Yes, what you're doing is very important.
it's likthe better you do, the better we know your dad is.
I'll start with heat.
I know it's not his fault.
I know what he says is involuntary, but it doesn't help.
inside, he's still the same man.
that's the problem.
apparently he's been thinking this stuff all along.
whoever that "same man" is, it's not the person I thought I was married to.
you okay?
she should be feeling something by now.
what does that mean? Is she sick too?
Marika! Honey!
you're burned. Why didn't you tell me it started to hurt?
I wanted to help daddy.
you said the better I do, the better daddy has to be.
sorry.
I'm starving.
only way we can do the test.
good thing it's you and not dr. Hadley.
could you keep her away from me?
I have a rich imaginative life.
I'd rather not share it.
we all have thoughts.
I know we all have sexual thoughts.
we have ignoble thoughts.
I just don't want those to be who I am to people, especially not to my wife.
I understand. I don't think it would be fair to define me by my passing thoughts.
my real choices are my actions.
and I've never done anything to hurt her.
I've never cheated.
you're kidding me. You've cheated? - What?
no. Why would you say that?
because you look guilty as hell.
are you serious?
of course you're serious.
Yes, everyone knows.
God, they must think you're a creep.
they might not know. They might be idiots.
just say these things.
Why'dou page me here?
I need you to update me on the patient's condition.
seems to be dead.
why'd you page me here?
I need you to update me on the patient's condition while hitting this against the wall.
this is the only place we can do both.
I finished the last blood draw.
I expect the people who work for me to rise to a challenge.
unless they don't expect to work for me.
last blood draw was at 6: 00 A. M.
sugar levels never rose above 120 all night.
so the glucose was normal.
means you were wrong about diabetes.
Itill think it's the endocrine system. Maybe I just got the wrong gland.
so you're going for thyroid instead pancreas? Makes sense.
fine. I'm not playing racquetball with wilson.
I was never playing racquetball with wilson.
I have never played racquetball with wilson.
I thought it would be helpful if a department head owed me a favor.
but it's not worth this.
not bad. You put on a good show. You studied up.
Wilson actually booked a court.
if you were really a racquetball player, you'd know that you were holding a squash racket.
tell kutner to doa thyroid reuptake scan, then go grab a nap in one of the on-call rooms.
we're taking you to do a thyroid reuptake scan. We think your
I'm not going a until you explain why my daughter has a bandage on her hand.
you just said you wanted to run some test.
I'd known it would involve pain, I'd have said, "hell, no.
it's a mild burn.
since marika has a neurological disability like you, we needed to make sure she has no disality.
nk, you know about her problem with auditory processing.
auditory processing"?
that's code for "I can't stand thinking my daughter's not perfect.
were indeterminate. She doesn't have a disability.
she day dreams.
she gets below-average marks in school because she's below average.
every parent thinks their child's "above average.
do you have any idea what the word average means?
somebody asto be under it.
Nick, shut up.
Oh, honey...
I'm not saying you're stupid.
your mother's not the sharpest crayon in the box, and she does great.
see, this is why I told your mother to keep you at home.
didn't want you here.
Marika, wait! Get her...
you're burning up.
and your lungs are full of fluid. We need to get it out.
I need 200 milligrams of furosemide and two milligrams of morphine, stat.
his temperature is 103.
infection.
the steroids must have forced it into the open.
what kind of infection? It could be anything.
staph aureus, tuberculosis, strongyloides...
go back to phineas, get a history.
we've got a history. He hasn't been out of the country.
get a detailed history.
no one at home is sick. No one at work is sick.
there's no sign of ticks or mosquitoes.
get a more detailed history. Ask him again.
and againuntil he remembers something. Not you. Kutn can do it.
you're gonna be busy with something else.
I'm here to invite you to lunch.
uh, why?
I've been made.
house sent me back to you as a double agent.
anything wrong?
eyes are a little red.
there's a shocker.
I haven't had a good night's sleep since this thing started.
you should get some rest yourself.
that's a good idea. This is going to take some time.
it'll be pretty exhaustive.
are you afraid of what you might say while I'm here?
Yes.
are you telling me there's something worse than what I've already heard?
no, I-I don't know what I'm gonna say.
I don't know how I'm gonna hurt you next.
I think we should be around each other as little as possible right now.
this is pathetic.
I know.
tell marika I love her very much.
she understands that.
I don't think she does.
you're just saying that to make me feel better.
Yeah.
guy leads a boring life. They stay home a lot.
no travel, no exotic pets, no nearby standing water.
you sound pleased about something. Can we get to that part?
his wife rescues dogs.
among others, a big rottweiler who's taken over the house.
our patient hates it.
was the wife there to hear is? - No.
too bad. Keep going.
the dog marks his territory all over the living room.
I asked what the odds were that he would have put down food or drink where the dog could reach.
he said he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television.
the dog was fixing the television? - Y.
the patient's eyes red? - Yeah.
I'm thinking weil's.
bacterial. He lucked out. Start him on doxycycline.
if he improves, we'll know we were right.
I told wilson you sent me to get information.
and now you're telling me.
what does that make you, a quadruple agent?
he let me print out his e-mails.
excellent. Information he wants us to have.
did he let you print out his deleted e-mails? - No.
as long as I was sitting there, I thought I'd print 'em anyway.
top one's the one you're looking for.
writing to confirm wednesday at 7: 00 P. M.
it's out going to jgonzalez@nymcy. Net.
there's a joan gonzalez in oncology.
it's a consult.
secret consult, 7:00 P.
Oh, Joan is perky.
you're wrong. There was a patient file attached.
where?
it was password-protected. - No.
Wilson doesn't password-protect his patient files.
I'm the only one he'd expect ever to look there, and he knows there's only one patient I'd want to check on.
you think wilson's sick?
if wilson had cancer, there'd be no reason for him to drive three hours to manhattan.
he could pull strings here and get the best trement.
six articles by gonzalez.
managing suicidal thoughts in oncology patients,
suicidal ideation in children with leukemia.
I don't want to ask this, but have you ever had reason to think he might be depressed?
no. Get out of here.
your fever's down and your lungs are clearing.
how long before this brain thing goes away?
the infection's gone, but the damage the infection did you'll have to live with.
you're telling me you can't fix this?
there's gotta be a way.
we'd need to remove the damaged area in our cingulate gyrus, buit's too close to the brainstem to risk surgery.
you can't risk it.
but I could shop around, and mae some better doctors at a better hospital
the brain stem ntrols the body's involuntary systems.
the slightest mistake could kill you.
even if you survive, you may never be able to breathe on your own again.
you may never-- - I get it.
I know this seems like a lot to deal with right now.
but people have adapted to living with all kinds of neurologica deficits.
Hey, at least we can promise you it won't get any worse.
get the hell out of my room.
your assistant said that you were out of the hospital, taking a walk.
is there an emergency?
I don't know. Is there?
you never take a walk unless you've got something you need to think about.
maybe you just don't have a good statistical samplin of my walks.
the other thing you do when you need to think is you come to my office.
apparently, this is something you can only discuss with gonzalez at new york mercy.
another graduate of the house school of being a dick.
private dick.
look, I'd love to stay for the full inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.
of course you need hot coffee.
it's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs.
Why?
you're going to tell me why I forgot my coat?
once you get outside, thecold would have reminded you.
you could have come back, but you didn't.
you chose to be uncomfortable.
why would someone choose that?
because they hate themselves?
has it ever occurred to you that when don't share something, it might notbe meant as a challenge?
it might just mean that I'd like there to beone molecule of my life that goes unexaminedby gregory house.
Nick greenwald. I hear you're the guy in charge.
I'm the patient with the disinhibition.
if you're here to say thanks, you're welcome. Now go away.
Oh, I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.
Oh, all the more reason to go away.
they're talking about sending me home.
to what? A life where I'll continually drive away anyone who might for a second care about me?
those are the brakes.
you could operate.
you could die.
so I'm either better or dead?
I'm okay with that.
I-I've always been kind of A... an impatient guy.
but I've worked hard to keep my mth shut.
I've made my wife happy. I've made my little girl happy.
I want that back.
otherwise, it's no life.
I want you to remove small problem.
I'm not a neuro surgeon.
but your boss is. You could assist.
I'm sure you'd like to add to your resume.
it's too near the brain stem. Nobody's gonna touch it.
your boss would. He's an egomaniac.
I know 'cause I keep seeing him at the club.
he just needs a little push.
I'm sure by now you've kissed his ass sufficiently.
would you like me to phrase it as "you're politically gifted"?
I can do that.
you want me to help you?
tell me why.
why what? - Why you care.
the puzzle's solved. The guy's alive.
and the odds of coming out of this surgery with that same status weren't that great.
my patient has a quality of life issue.
he says awful things.
hardly a medical condition.
when he leaves here, he's going to lose his family.
he's gonna alienate the people he works with.
and if he ever fdsa friend who's willing to put up with his crap, he'll be lucky.
until he drives them away too.
I'll see what I can do.
you've apparently got this whole coat thing backwards.
I may have over reacted.
you definitely overreacted.
I knew you'd meet me halfway. - It made me think.
you only snap on one subject: Losing people.
so I went back to the intel.
it's true there's only one doctor named gonzalez at new york mercy, but there's a Javier Gonzalez who's a nurse in the psych ward.
and who could you lose who'd end up there?
maybe the reason I don't always open up to you is because it's redundant.
once you got a name, it's amazing how much stuff you can learn on the phone.
I mean, if you're a doctor and you lie freely.
they found your brother sleeping in the lobby of an office buiing in manhattan.
got aggressive when they asked him to leave, and e cops took him to the mercy psych ward.
there have been new anti-psychotics developed since he ran away.
he's been on them for a couple of days.
and by tonight, he should be in shape to talk to me.
but you're not sure if he wants to.
I'll be in new york in a few hours. I guess I'll find out.
why wouldn't you tell me this?
house, you and I...
we don't have the normal social contract.
I don't expect you to tell me the lies
I am fully capable of lying to you.
I've lied plenty of times.
I mean, collaborative lies.
giving someone a hand who maybe needs to deceive themselves just a little.
for two days I've been thinking about how danny's gonna react when he sees me.
if I said that to anybody else, they'd say, "don't worry. It'll all be all right.
you wouldn't.
because it might all go horribly wrong.
Yeah.
Yeah, it might.
in which case, you might want some company.
your heart's beating. First hurdle past.
now we need know if you can breathe for yourself.
Oh, thank god.
now, do you know who you are?
Nick green wald. Former S. O.B.
thank you.
now I can go back to my beautiful life with my beautiful wife.
maybe she'll stop whining and cut me some slack now that I've risked my life.
doesn't make sense. We removed the problem.
we removed the damage. Maybe we were wrong about the problem.
I need to believe we can get through this.
temperature's 94. 5
do you really think I'm stupid?
honey, you're not stupid. You' just-- please don't do this.
it could be the effect of the surgery.
do you at least respect me, nick what do you think of what I do for a living?
I think people who publice important things are people who can't do important things themselves.
honey, stop. Don't.
do you regret marrying me? - 94. 2
sometimes. Everybody wonders-- - Get me a heating blanket.
do you even love me? - Yes.
I don't know why.
aud, wait. Let me
v-tach. Get me the paddles.
clear.
echo says his heart is structurally fine.
but his temperature is still dropping.
he's headed for hypothermia.
I can't reach House. It just goes to voicemail.
it means we were wrong about infection.
his temperature's just going up and down because something's playing with his thermostat.
which means the brain damage is spreading.
what causes brain damage and nosebleedd involves the lungs, heart and kidneys?
cancer? We could text him.
it's not cancer normal psa, normal blood smear, colonoscopy normal.
do a full body scan.
house hates full body scans.
house isn't here. - House is right.
everybody's got three or four meaningless anomalies that'll come up on a scan.
chasing each one will take time we don't have.
feel free to send him an im.
you told me you saw your brother once.
after he disappeared.
13 years ago.
I used to go to princeton whenever I could.
I must have hit every homeless shelter in town.
and then one day, I'm just sitting at this deli, having a sandwich,
I look out the window, and there he is.
he was gone by the time I got outside.
that's why you wereo eager when I told you there was a job at princeton.
I thought it was just my charm.
that's the team. Shouldn't you answer?
they already texted me to s they're doing something stupid.
there's a small abdominal eurysm.
irrelevant. What else you got?
cyst in the pleura around the lungs.
also irrelevant. Couldn't cause any of the sympts.
there's a density in the liver. Could be vascular malformation.
if he's got multiple avms, screwed-up blood flow would explain erything.
we can only spot them with angiography.
we'll have to do targeted scans with contrast and then embolize each one.
can we do that before he freezes?
we'll find out.
the spell-correct on kutner's phone has got a hair trigger.
either that, or the patient has a cyclone in the floral of his lungs.
you took a walk in 45-degree weather, and you left your coat behind.
go ahead.
I think you were punishing yourself.
I think you wanted to feel what it would be like be homeless a new jersey winter.
that tells me guilt.
that tells me something happened.
the schizophrenia started when he was a teenager.
when he was in college.
he was on meds, but he'd still think a professor was out to get him because he got a b, or he'd fight with his roommates because he never showered.
where were you? - Med school.
he called me every day. Talked for hours.
I didn't have hours.
interesting.
later for that. Go on.
I was tiredof being the guy that everybody counted on, so one night, danny called
one night, danny called, crying, upset about something.
I had to study for an exam.
so I-I hung up...
OK my things. I went to the library so I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.
I wonderhow that turned out.
my mother called me the next day.
Danny had run away and left his meds behind.
which I knew meant that he would never be able to choose to come back, because he'd be so detached from reality.
so you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down.
and because we're wired to find meaning in semi-random events, you decided never to be that careless again.
you don't think that's a little facile?
actually, I don't.
I think you did it consciously.
you developed your people-pleasing talents the way an olympic athlete develops his muscles.
talk about an overreaction to a single event.
it was a pretty big event.
hanging up the phone?
that's what you're blaming all this on.
that's the behavior you've been trying to correct.
as though nothing else went wrong in your brother'life.
of course, he overreacted too but...
his glucose was normal.
we're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?
it's House. Adms don't explain his glucose.
since this is significant moment in my life and all...
Yeah. - I think I'll just go in then.
explain that. - Right.
you'd given him steroids. His glucose should have been elevated.
that wannabe cyst you found in the whole body scan, without the glucose, it's an irrelevant cyst.
with the glucose, it's a relevant fibroma.
he has doege-potter syndrome.
his fibroma is secreting human growth hormone, which acts like insulin, wering his glucose.
it doesn't explain the organ failure orhe brain damage.
this whole thing is an overreaction.
that one small fibroma.
it's benign, but his by'sacting like it's an invader.
his antibodies went to war against it and got carried away, attack his other systems.
take out the froma, he'll be a happy hypocrite again in no time.
maybe I should call a cab.
your wife's probably just late. - Yeah.
I'm sorry about...
you know... the things I said.
I have a copicuous nose.
it suits your face.
I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic.
I have some good news.
I was gonna tell you, and then you got sick.
it didn't seem like the best time.
I've been offered a better position.
I'd be coordinating cancer areness walks in three cities.
that's great. Congratulations.
I know you've worked hard for this.
thank you.
is Marika okay?
I'm sure she's moved on.
kids are so resilient.
you okay?
I'll be seeing danny again next week.
I'd like you to meet him. - Sure. He sounds interesting.
go on.
I thought seeing him again would change everything.
it would be wonderful or terrible.
instead... we're just strangers.
it's kind of anticlimactic.
which is better than terrible.
go on.
does it bother you that whave no social contract?
my whole life is one big compromise.
I tiptoe around everyone like they're made of china.
I spend all my time analyzing: What will the effect be if I say this?
then there's you. You're a reality junkie.
if I offered you a comforting lie, you'd smack me over the head with it.
let's not change that.
okay.
no, see, this-- if you were implementing the social contract, you'd say that, but only because it makes me feel better...
it is kind of fun watching you torture yourself.
do you think things will work out with my brother? - No.
but when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault.
Thanks, House.
you doactually like monster trucks.
Abosolutely.
how long have I...
forced trauma to the head...
since the accident, he's had a continued...
why can't I get up? - No episodes of hyperten...
what's wrong with my legs? - Ekg's show normal...
someone talk to me. You don't hear me talking to you?
normal feeling pressure, normal C. K.Troponin...
great heart for transplant.
my heart? Oh, god! They don't know I'm in here.
Hey, genius.
I think it violates certain ethical laws to rip the organs out of a guy who's still alive.
possibly certain law laws too. - Thank you. Thank you.
could you, um, get backin your bed, please, Mr. House?
it's actually doctor House.
this guy's a doctor?
there's also navy seal house.
but you're going to have to save up for that one.
Really? Well, that's interesting, but...
you're here because you crashed your motorcycle, not because I need a consult.
so, get back in bed.
I scraped my elbow, I just need a truck load of vicodin. Whereas, this guy
he's brain dead. - No, I'm not!
so drop it. - See that?
minimal brain waves don't mean he's alive.
I am alive! I'm here! - No ekg response to painful stimuli, hot or cold.
what you're seeing is random, barely discernable.
I discerned it. - Listen to him, please.
no, that's just the amplifier's internal noise level.
it's on increased sensitivity. - No, it's not! It's me.
then why is his eye following you? - Exactly.
following motion's an involuntary reflex. - No.
you're a doctor... you should know these things.
no, no, I'm not dead, I need help. I'm here!
I also know about locked-in syndrome
that things are either involuntary... or voluntary.
blink if you can hear me. - I hear you.
Oh, this is going to be fun.
eye movement is deliberate.
can you blink once for "yes," twice for "no?
I hope so.
the square root of nine?
he got that faster than you.
the brain is fully functional. - Lee...
Where's Molly?
you were in an accident.
hit the brake, hit the brake, hit the brake!
you've sustained a traumatic injury to your brain stem which has cut off your brain's ability to communicate with the rest of your body.
can you fix me? Where's Molly?
you still have movement in your eyes.
so we can get you to a rehab facility where they can teach you how to communicate.
no, I can't be stuck like this.
unless... the crash didn't cause the brain damage.
maybe the brain damage caused the crash.
Yeah, I couldn't stop. Why couldn't I stop?
look at his palms. There's no scrapes.
he didn't even try to protect himself.
so you had slowed reflexes-- or no reflexes.
you're not a doctor in this hospital. You are a patient.
Yeah, and you're the guy who wants to cut out my organs, and he's the guy who doesn't.
stroke, cancer, even a simple infection, anything that insults the central pons could do this.
then that means that I could be fixed.
you're giving him false hope.
he needs to accept what's happened.
and work on making the most of it.
don't look at me like that. That's not making me feel better.
I love you.
I don't know how god is going to get us through this. But he will.
stop it. I'm blushing.
what are you doing?
just looking for some reading material for the crapper.
these CTs-- - Get back in your bed. Come on.
the children are in the waiting area, can I bring them in?
no. No, don't.
you don't want to see them?
I don't want them having nightmares. I don't want to scare them, Molly.
you don't want them to see you?
it's okay. I understand.
you're going to be better soon enough.
you really that sure?
why are you so sure? Baby, how'd you get so sure?
you okay?
never better. - Here's your burger.
if you can't bring Mohammed to Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed.
that's my diagnostics posse.
hot, dark, and darker.
talk about getting me better, please.
what are you doing up in middletown? - Who cares?
buying a Gibson '57 goldtop.
it's the guitar Duane All Man used to play.
next to the trauma, the mostly likely causes of a sudden onset of locked-in syndrome are basilar artery stroke, and brain hemorrhage.
ct was clean.
man, those fries look good.
guy's an active bike rider, his heart's fine.
a well-placed tumor could explain.
jeez, is the last thing I ate gonna be the last thing I ate?
it could evade the CT, and still show up on an MRI with contrast.
it was a melted power bar.
she's the smart one.
I just keep dark and darker to fill out the quota.
if we find it, treat it, you could be fine.
I never thought I'd be praying for a brain tumor, but please, dear god.
if you're praying in there, stop it right now.
we'll get his doctor to order an mri.
his doctor's busy teaching him how to blink out "kill me" in morse code.
luckily, I found some forms under the mattress.
check it out, they have those MRI video goggles.
I heard these were awesome. - What do you see?
it's a beach.
Oh, look, there's Taub drinking a margarita and mocking us for driving all the way up here...
easy, I can still feel in here.
excuse Dr. Kutner, he gets a little excited about new technology.
it can get loud in there, and a little closed off.
these will put you in a quiet place.
you can create a relaxing scenario for yourself.
I hope they... wk.
you're in my relaxing scenario?
I guess you like me.
either that, or you got sent here.
what? By god?
I'm not sure if I believe in god.
you spend an awful ot of time in church for someone who doesn't.
I don't not believe either.
it's either one or the other.
I go to church mainly to keep my wife happy, but...
I don't know, I've never actually thought that god could reach out and affect my life.
but getting a brilliant doctor in the bed next to me?
God is also the guy who opened his car door in front of you.
I think Molly was right. I think you were sent here to make me get better.
I think so.
Hey, dad.
making a volcano.
you're making a volcano? It looks like it. What you doing, baby?
what time is it? - Hope you don't mind.
my new roommate snores.
and my new room doesn't have you.
your MRI showed a lesion in the central pons.
what is that? What does that mean?
see it there? - No.
mm, that's what they said. But it's there.
which means no way head trauma did this.
it's cancer, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome.
unfortunately, your current doctor thinks its diffuse nature means an infection.
and the bad news is, the antivirals he's got you on might kill you.
I'm not gonna die.
but the good news is if they just almost kill you, then Dr. Idiot will realize that his name is not a coincidence - and he'll let me do whatever I want. - Thank you.
see, the irony here is...
you're kind of fascinating.
so many questions.
but if y could answer any of them, yo wouldn't be fascinating.
I get it, you're a little nuts, aren't you?
your wife is the one getting you through this.
your wife and me.
although frankly, the MRI was a lot more useful than four hours of hand-holding.
I think.
if you had a wife, you'd know why it matters.
you're a good guy. Easy to talk to.
wait, something's happening. What's happening to me?
I need some help in here!
your patient is seizing.
why would he have a seizure?
because he has cancer!
his brain stem is compromised.
why are you still arguing with this guy? You thought I was dead.
welcome back. And nice played. You almost died. Exactly as we planned.
you knew this was going to happen?
it usually happens when you treat cancer by pretending it's not cancer.
right, doctor? My turn?
it's cancer? - No, it isn't.
Yes!
a small tumorin his brain stem, causing paraneoplastic syndrome.
he needs plasmapheresis.
can you give that to him?
no, I'm sorry, I completely disagree with Dr. House.
please shut up. - I don't.
which means I can treat him.
let him. Let him.
is that what you want? - Absolutely.
would you send up a couple of bellboys?
I got the transfer papers. Plasmapheresis is all set up. Are you okay?
fresh infusion of macho. You like?
I can't move, and she's worried about his boo-boo?
what were you doing up there, anyway?
antiquing. I found you a te Victorian corset. Come by later, I'll tie you up.
is he hitting on her?
if she turns around, she's into him too. And ther yeah.
sorry I didn't show up in Middletown. I didn't get the message.
probably because there was no message.
I've decided to accept your resignation.
uh, I thought we were past this. I decided to stay.
no, you didn't. You had it decided for you.
so now you're stuck here with a boss who knows that you want to be somewhere else.
which means you're no longer motivated to impress me, which means you're no longer motivated to come up with good ideas.
unless I'm wrong.
save the cheer leader. Save your world.
I got it from here.
I thought you already solved this. Are you thinking you might be wrong?
what's going on?
Hey, just curious... what were you driving up to Middletown for?
what do you care? - Why does he care?
because I'm your friend.
I was buying a guitar. - Yeah, I heard that.
it used to belong to a guitarist who died in a motorcycle accident.
it just reeks of you screwing with people.
your crash was ten miles from the Orange County Progressive Pain Vlinic.
you live ten miles from Mary's dress shop.
and yet, that's not even on my list of reasons that I think you'resecretly a transvestite.
if you're going to another state to get more narcotics
he's on drugs? - I went to visit your ex-ex-ex-wife...
what? - Who lives in Thompson ridge.
I let her know about the extra money you're making on the lecture circuit.
so she'll be sure to adjust your alimony.
you wouldn't do that. - Yeah. I wouldn't do that.
would you?
you guys are friends?
shouldn't we be entertaining our patient?
I performed Euripides with sock puppets.
you just missed it.
house said we should.
the mind is like a muscle.
if you don't exercise it, it'll atrophy, just like anything else.
whoever's with him needs to talk.
keep his mind active, and it'll show House you still care.
not sure if I do.
jeez, you're my doctor? - Then why don't you just quit?
I'm not sure I want to do that, either.
maybe you should figure it out before House figures it out for you.
Yeah, maybe you should have your midlife crisis after I'm better.
we'll be right back. - Wait.
wait, what did you just see?
do you drink? - He's a roofer.
alcohol hardly proves your theory.
Marchiafava bignami disease fits.
LFT's are normal.
speak English. Is it fixable? What does that mean?
that hurts.
no tremors.
how much do you drink? A six-pack a day?
I hate beer, I don't even drink beer. - Maybe more or less.
or maybe something else.
it may not be alcohol at all.
street opiates can also cause locked-in
I don't get high.
so, eitherwe play 20, 000 questions with every street drug, or instead of talking to him, we talk to the lesion.
talk to me. - We're going to biopsy the brain stem?
for the record, that doesn't count as your inspired idea.
it's sort of where I was heading.
you're going to cut into my head? Why?
stop treating me like a piece of furniture!
I have a right to know what's going on!
Where's that going?
blood in your urine clogged up your old catheter.
peeing blood? That must be what the insecure doctor saw.
every new clue gets us closer to the answer.
damn it. - The surgery will get us more clues.
you have visitors.
no. Oh, Molly.
come in.
daddy! - Daddy!
I told you not to bring them.
well, they wanted to see their father.
I can't even hug them.
they can handle it.
it's going to be all right.
you're not so sure anymore, are you?
they must've told you that it's dangerous.
that I could die.
and that's why you brought them in here...
I got an A+ on my test.
to see me before I die.
I love you, daddy.
daddy loves you too.
I want to show you my drawings.
kids just want a dad.
even if he's just a lump.
maybe you should go now.
Oh, no. They can stay, please. Let them stay.
Bye, daddy.
Bye, daddy.
sorry. You were crying.
damn.
we're going to put you out, just so we can drill the hole.
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
then we'll wake you back up.
we'll need you to answer some simple yes or no questions while we're cutting, - to make sure we're not cutting... - It seems to be working.
deep breaths.
in about ten seconds, you'll feel lightheaded.
and by now...
you should be floating high with lucy in the sky.
how come I'm not better?
God's not supposed to work in trial and error.
God's mistakes are well-documented.
if he'd done everything right the first time, there'd have been one plague and zero great floods.
those were because of human mistakes.
you think your doctor has an apartment on mount Olympus?
God put me with you for a reason.
I'm gonna be all right still, right?
I don't know.
Lee. You with me now?
easy questions. You'll be done before you know it.
is this equation correct?
what, so if you make a mistake, I'm not going to know that anymore?
are these lines parallel? Spatial relationships intact.
take a look at this circle.
is more than half of it shaded?
of course.
don't forget to blink. Is more than half of the circle shaded?
sorry, yes.
look at me, Lee. Again.
is more than half of this circle shaded?
blink. Come on, lee, blink. - Foreman, back out.
Whyan't I blink? Why can't I blink?
why aren't his eyes moving?
two options: My neurologist screwed up, or else something the hospital lawyer's going to have to come up with when you sue us.
blinking and eye movements are controlled by a small cluster of nerves, just millimeters from the biopsy site.
but he's still in there, right? I mean, he just can't communicate?
it's possible.
also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.
he had one way to communicate, and now that's gone. Well played.
brain biopsy revealed severe damage to the myelin sheath. Question is, why?
epstein barr, picorna viruses, malaria.
he runs a business, meets a lot of people, he could've picked up rotavirus.
did he report having bloody diarrhea?
the wife's not sure, says he doesn't complain.
did you ask him?
we've prioritized. He can only blink, a real history would've taken weeks.
if he had epste barr, he'd have belly pains.
if he had picorna virus, he'd have headaches.
five other yes/no questions, and maybe we'd know what treatment to give.
and what treatment would kill him.
unless he's already dead.
maybe there's another way.
brain computer interface-- better known as BCI.
the go is to get you to move that cursor with your mind.
when you think "up," the computer records the pattern.
think "up" enough times, it eventually learns what you're thinking.
so... start thinking "up.
you in there?
are you trying?
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife.
she was at a sweat lodge in new Mexico last week.
what were you really doing in New York?
you know how you hate it when I meddle in your lies?
I mean your life.
why are you being so evasive?
unless you have something to evade.
interesting.
this has nothing to do with you, your ex-wife, or my pain.
I was heading to the down-state correctional facility in Fishkill.
one of your hookers arrange a conjugal visit?
it's where Foreman's brother is being held.
this is going to mean months of sleepless nights, wondering if I could've done something differently.
maybe it's not that I'm sick of House.
it's that I'm sick of being scared out of my mind to go to work every day.
sorry.
did that just...
was that you?
are you really in there?
I knew you were in there.
I was scared. - Tha god.
I am scared.
Molly, I love you so much.
have you had any bloody diarrhea in the last two weeks?
rotavirus out.
any recent joint pain
epstein barr's out.
have you traveled out of the country lately?
what about inside the country?
he was in St. Louis.
good. Could be missouri malaria. Let's start treatment.
he was--he was there.
the machine must not be working.
either that, or he lied to you about it. People do that sometimes.
for example, I just lied to him about missouri malaria.
did you go to St. Louis?
I should've told you. Why didn't I just tell you?
down.
when you weren't in St. Louis for two days,
I assume you were getting some strange for two days.
so does she. You have to tell her I wasn't.
amazing.
a man who only has two blips at his disposal can still lie.
I'm not lying.
if you were getting some really strange strange, you could've contracted neu infection went to your brain, froze you right up.
good news is it's treatable.
you'll be up and moving in time to sign the divorce papers.
why would I tell you the truth about being in St. Louis, and then not tell you the truth about this?
he just admitted he wasn't in St. Louis in front of his wife, and you think he's lying when she's not even in here?
I'm liking this one more and more. Don't fire him.
were you out of the state?
I never left.
were you within 20 miles of your house?
Yes.
were you within five miles? - Yes.
within two miles? - Yes.
did you stay at a hotel? - No.
you had to sleep somewhere. Your car?
no.
a friend's house?
Yes. Yes.
that narrows it down, depending on how popular you are.
tell the wife to stop crying, get in here.
he says that when he was supposed to be in St. Louis, he was staying at a friend's house.
really. - Yes.
let's assume that you believe him for the moment.
name your friends within two miles. - Martin and kim's?
no.
guess someone who doesn't have a wife.
Dave? - Yes.
got an address?
if this is where he got sick, someone else here should have symptoms.
not if Lee was the only one coming down to the basement.
furnace is rusty, but no gas leaks.
resumes and cover letters here...
some are weeks old.
he's been spending time here for a while.
business wasn't going good.
I didn't want you and the kids to worry.
I was trying to protect you.
I wish you could hear me.
I wish I could make all of this better.
looks like he temped a few times. As a janitor.
factory out on route 10.
factory foreman says they make rechargeable batteries.
mostly for cell phones.
big step down from running your own business, to sweeping up.
doing what I had to do.
metal filings.
judging by the color, I'd say cadmium.
which he'd aerosolize with the broom, then right into his lungs.
heavy metal poisoning--explains everything.
the chelation will scrub the heavy metals out of your blood.
if we are right about the cause, we should see some movement in about a day or so.
can't put this thing on turbo?
I'm getting a little anxious in here.
somebody will be here at all times to, uh, irrigate our eyes, keep you company.
hopefully, it'll help make the time go quicker.
my eyes still feel really dry.
thank you... for thinking "up.
for helping me find you in there.
man, when you moved that cursor...
bought my first girlfriend a necklace. It was silver.
it cost 180 bucks--had to save for six months.
she hated it.
really, seriously?
did you tell this story to someone who could walk away?
never bought another girlfriend jewelry again.
until Dr. Hadley. - You're dating her?
you might want to start all your stories with that.
same thing... she didn't even wear it.
the diamond thing, she was wearing it the other day.
if she doesn't like it, she doesn't like it.
apparently, I suckat picking out jewelry, but least have the guts to tell me.
okay, getting boring again.
how long until we know if this treatment is working?
you lied to me.
I wasn't having an affair.
so we needed money. Who cares?
last time business was slow, you got migraines every day.
why would you do that to me?
I'm sorry, I was--I was stupid. I was--don't go! Don't!
damn it, somebody... put "I'm sorry"on this stupid computer.
my eye is killing me.
I want to keep my job.
great. All you got to do is come up with a good idea.
how about we hook the guy's brain into a computer, so he can communicate?
that's a great idea.
for the guy who invented the computer that can read minds.
your idea was to use his idea.
you didn't come up with it. No one else came up with it.
if I didn't re-establish communication, we never would've found
what's interesting is why you're here now.
not when I gave you the ultimatum.
was it something the patient said?
I realized that what we do here... terrifies me.
and...
overcoming that is the only way I can matter.
Kutner found the battery factory.
Kutner came up with the cadmium.
maybe you don't matter.
I'm going to close your eyes so you can get some sleep.
hopefully, when you wake up, we'll see some improvement.
hope that includes my eye feeling better.
hand me the flourescein stain.
what's that mean?
epithelium looks torn.
these drops sting.
I'm going to close your left eye to keep it protected.
I'm going to blink your eye a few times to distribute the dye.
ulcerative keratitis.
means it's not cadmium poisoning.
which means you don't know what's wrong. Again.
when's the last time you changed that dressing?
judging by the smell of it, I'd say never.
he's locked-in, his kidneys blew a fuse, and now his eye is oozing puss.
I assume you went over all of that with your team.
I also assume they didn't have any brilliant ideas, or you wouldn't still be muttering to yourself.
this is going to hurt.
the way he's losing his myelin makes an infection most likely. Could be varicella
road debris has come to the surface. I'm going to have to scrub it out.
but the initial acyclovir would've treated that.
which pushes me towards an autoimmune disease.
like behcet'S.
here... this is going to hurt even more. Take two now, two later.
Oops.
of course, if the varicella was resistant, it wouldn't matter what they did up in Middletown.
do an lp.
you've been in the ER too long.
when the patient had head trauma, white blood cells only indicate that he had head trauma.
or you could use the lp for something useful.
if you find polys, it's varicella. Lymphs, behcet'S.
why did I fire you again?
you didn't. I quit.
you weren't visiting Foreman's brother, either.
busy...
Kutner's doing an lp, so I have to focus.
I had prison security check visitor logs, phone records.
you've never had any contact with anyone at Fishkill.
so, I ask again...
what were you doing up in Middletown?
you know what's more interesting than what I was doing?
the reason you are so obsessed with what I was doing.
stop deflecting, House. - Says the deflector.
the reason I was up there...
is the reason you're scared I was up there.
I was checking out your dirty, little secret.
how long have you been sleeping with her?
how did you know?
your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing.
and the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.
we've only been out a few times.
she's a care giver. Like all of your other failed exes.
and someone who takes care of your brother.
who was the last person who took care of your brother?
you think this is oedipal?
actually, I was thinking masturbatory.
I guess your mom took care of him first.
so, the safe course is to gouge your eyes out.
lp stands for lumbar puncture.
we use this needle tocollect fluid from your spine.
that's a really big needle.
you're going to feel some extreme pressure in your back.
I already feel pressure in my front-- my chest hurts.
something's wrong. No, my chest!
something's wrong. I think I'm hav-- oh, god!
call the code.
there is no god.
you don't know what's wrong with me
it doesn't seem that way.
so am I dead?
not yet.
but you're about to be.
okay.
Charging... clear.
again... clear.
he's back.
no. No. Let me go.
he can't fix me.
I've been here for three days, everything hurts.
it's okay, just--just stop fighting.
she's got to go on with her life.
the kids don't need this. I can't do nothing for them--I can't
scratch this foot--wow, that really, really itches.
so we put ina temporary pacer. - Shut up, shut up.
he's trying to talk.
is something bothering you?
if there's still tightness in your chest, it's expected.
is it your eye?
why is he saying "no"three times? You only asked one question.
maybe he's not saying "no," maybe he's saying "down.
are you saying that the pain is lower? How low, your leg?
your foot?
left foot?
check his--let me see now-- yeah, his right foot.
no bruises, no rashes, no cuts.
then there should beno pain.
is there a tingling sensation?
is it itching?
itchy foot means liver failure.
the liver's fine. His enzymes have been normal since we admitted him.
I didn't say "failing,"I said "failure." Just like you.
liver's like a cruise ship taking on water.
as it starts to sink, it sends out an S. O.S.
only instead of radio waves, it uses enzymes.
the more enzymes in the blood, the worse the liver is.
and once the ship has sunk, there's no more S. O.S.
you think the liver's fine, but it's already at the bottom of the sea.
so dying liver released toxins, damaged the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.
now we just need to know what's causing the liver failure.
liver, plus eye, plus kidney-- most likely sclerosing cholangitis.
Oh, god, if only Taub had said that, it would've been a happy ending.
do a biopsy to confirm.
I'm going to numb up the area where we'll go in for the punch biopsy.
Where's the new bracelet?
she was wearing the bracelet?
you didn't notice that I was wearing it?
because you weren't.
he noticed, and you didn't?
if you don't like it, it's fine, it's not a big deal.
I like it, that's the point.
I'd rather have itat home in the jewelry box than getting peed on at work.
you got the patient's urine on that arm?
when I was putting in the catheter. Why?
you've got a rash.
the bracelet's real. - I figured.
so what if the rash isn't just a rash?
what if it's an infection?
if there were rats in that basement, then the liver failure could be caused by leptospirosis.
it transfers through urine. Rat pee to him, his pee to you.
the infection would need an entry point.
look for any recent scratches, cuts.
look. Next to his fingernail.
the infection destroyed your liver, which released toxins that caused the locked-in syndrome.
you were dying of a paper cut.
I hope you're right this time.
we found rats in your buddy Dave's basement.
tested positive for leptospirosis.
that means we're on the right treatment.
so... try moving a finger.
your brain needs to get used to doing its job again. Try harder.
I'm sure you've lost hope.
I know we've told you several times that we knew what this was, but this time we're right.
concentrate. Move one finger for me.
welcome back.
I did it.
rat pee. Very nice idea.
who came up with it?
I did.
good.
you okay with him claiming the credit?
it was his idea. He saw the rash
if he did, he'd have hung a "mission accomplished" banner in my outer office.
don't toy with him. If you're going to fire him
the fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie.
that's all I needed to know. Rat pee.
that's a very nice idea.
house. You left this in my office.
no, I didn't.
so either I have a hole in my pocket
Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it.
because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it.
you would've thrown her right in my face.
you underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.
and then there were all those calls you weren't taking in front of me.
so I dialed the number of the calls you weren't taking.
you're seeing a psychiatrist.
you had no right to invade my privacy.
is--is that...? - Yeah. It's irony.
God sent you.
suddenly, you're not so fascinating.
you're spying on your team.
prioritize, Wilson.
is that what you really want to torture me about right now?
I don't want to torture you at all. I think this is a great thing.
not something you have to drive an hour out of town to shroud in mystery.
whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time.
maybe I'll discover that my childhood wasn't perfect.
so your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went.
which leads me to believe that maybe something else has changed.
maybe you think you can change.
I credit Cuddy with that.
not much credit to take, because I'm not going back.
Oh, House, please...
I assume you went because you're tired of screwing up every chance.
you get at happiness. - New contact. Delete contact.
do not let the fact that I found out about it
don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work.
you'll end up alone.
how long have I...
forced trauma to the head...
since the accident, he's had a continued...
why can't I get up? - No episodes of hyperten...
what's wrong with my legs? - Ekg's show normal...
someone talk to me. You don't hear me talking to you?
normal feeling pressure, normal C. K.Troponin...
great heart for transplant.
my heart? Oh, god! They don't know I'm in here.
Hey, genius.
I think it violates certain ethical laws to rip the organs out of a guy who's still alive.
possibly certain law laws too. - Thank you. Thank you.
could you, um, get backin your bed, please, Mr. House?
it's actually doctor House.
this guy's a doctor?
there's also navy seal house.
but you're going to have to save up for that one.
Really? Well, that's interesting, but...
you're here because you crashed your motorcycle, not because I need a consult.
so, get back in bed.
I scraped my elbow, I just need a truck load of vicodin. Whereas, this guy
he's brain dead. - No, I'm not!
so drop it. - See that?
minimal brain waves don't mean he's alive.
I am alive! I'm here! - No ekg response to painful stimuli, hot or cold.
what you're seeing is random, barely discernable.
I discerned it. - Listen to him, please.
no, that's just the amplifier's internal noise level.
it's on increased sensitivity. - No, it's not! It's me.
then why is his eye following you? - Exactly.
following motion's an involuntary reflex. - No.
you're a doctor... you should know these things.
no, no, I'm not dead, I need help. I'm here!
I also know about locked-in syndrome
that things are either involuntary... or voluntary.
blink if you can hear me. - I hear you.
Oh, this is going to be fun.
eye movement is deliberate.
can you blink once for "yes," twice for "no?
I hope so.
the square root of nine?
he got that faster than you.
the brain is fully functional. - Lee...
Where's Molly?
you were in an accident.
hit the brake, hit the brake, hit the brake!
you've sustained a traumatic injury to your brain stem which has cut off your brain's ability to communicate with the rest of your body.
can you fix me? Where's Molly?
you still have movement in your eyes.
so we can get you to a rehab facility where they can teach you how to communicate.
no, I can't be stuck like this.
unless... the crash didn't cause the brain damage.
maybe the brain damage caused the crash.
Yeah, I couldn't stop. Why couldn't I stop?
look at his palms. There's no scrapes.
he didn't even try to protect himself.
so you had slowed reflexes-- or no reflexes.
you're not a doctor in this hospital. You are a patient.
Yeah, and you're the guy who wants to cut out my organs, and he's the guy who doesn't.
stroke, cancer, even a simple infection, anything that insults the central pons could do this.
then that means that I could be fixed.
you're giving him false hope.
he needs to accept what's happened.
and work on making the most of it.
don't look at me like that. That's not making me feel better.
I love you.
I don't know how god is going to get us through this. But he will.
stop it. I'm blushing.
what are you doing?
just looking for some reading material for the crapper.
these CTs-- - Get back in your bed. Come on.
the children are in the waiting area, can I bring them in?
no. No, don't.
you don't want to see them?
I don't want them having nightmares. I don't want to scare them, Molly.
you don't want them to see you?
it's okay. I understand.
you're going to be better soon enough.
you really that sure?
why are you so sure? Baby, how'd you get so sure?
you okay?
never better. - Here's your burger.
if you can't bring Mohammed to Princeton, bring Princeton to Mohammed.
that's my diagnostics posse.
hot, dark, and darker.
talk about getting me better, please.
what are you doing up in middletown? - Who cares?
buying a Gibson '57 goldtop.
it's the guitar Duane All Man used to play.
next to the trauma, the mostly likely causes of a sudden onset of locked-in syndrome are basilar artery stroke, and brain hemorrhage.
ct was clean.
man, those fries look good.
guy's an active bike rider, his heart's fine.
a well-placed tumor could explain.
jeez, is the last thing I ate gonna be the last thing I ate?
it could evade the CT, and still show up on an MRI with contrast.
it was a melted power bar.
she's the smart one.
I just keep dark and darker to fill out the quota.
if we find it, treat it, you could be fine.
I never thought I'd be praying for a brain tumor, but please, dear god.
if you're praying in there, stop it right now.
we'll get his doctor to order an mri.
his doctor's busy teaching him how to blink out "kill me" in morse code.
luckily, I found some forms under the mattress.
check it out, they have those MRI video goggles.
I heard these were awesome. - What do you see?
it's a beach.
Oh, look, there's Taub drinking a margarita and mocking us for driving all the way up here...
easy, I can still feel in here.
excuse Dr. Kutner, he gets a little excited about new technology.
it can get loud in there, and a little closed off.
these will put you in a quiet place.
you can create a relaxing scenario for yourself.
I hope they... wk.
you're in my relaxing scenario?
I guess you like me.
either that, or you got sent here.
what? By god?
I'm not sure if I believe in god.
you spend an awful ot of time in church for someone who doesn't.
I don't not believe either.
it's either one or the other.
I go to church mainly to keep my wife happy, but...
I don't know, I've never actually thought that god could reach out and affect my life.
but getting a brilliant doctor in the bed next to me?
God is also the guy who opened his car door in front of you.
I think Molly was right. I think you were sent here to make me get better.
I think so.
Hey, dad.
making a volcano.
you're making a volcano? It looks like it. What you doing, baby?
what time is it? - Hope you don't mind.
my new roommate snores.
and my new room doesn't have you.
your MRI showed a lesion in the central pons.
what is that? What does that mean?
see it there? - No.
mm, that's what they said. But it's there.
which means no way head trauma did this.
it's cancer, causing a paraneoplastic syndrome.
unfortunately, your current doctor thinks its diffuse nature means an infection.
and the bad news is, the antivirals he's got you on might kill you.
I'm not gonna die.
but the good news is if they just almost kill you, then Dr. Idiot will realize that his name is not a coincidence - and he'll let me do whatever I want. - Thank you.
see, the irony here is...
you're kind of fascinating.
so many questions.
but if y could answer any of them, yo wouldn't be fascinating.
I get it, you're a little nuts, aren't you?
your wife is the one getting you through this.
your wife and me.
although frankly, the MRI was a lot more useful than four hours of hand-holding.
I think.
if you had a wife, you'd know why it matters.
you're a good guy. Easy to talk to.
wait, something's happening. What's happening to me?
I need some help in here!
your patient is seizing.
why would he have a seizure?
because he has cancer!
his brain stem is compromised.
why are you still arguing with this guy? You thought I was dead.
welcome back. And nice played. You almost died. Exactly as we planned.
you knew this was going to happen?
it usually happens when you treat cancer by pretending it's not cancer.
right, doctor? My turn?
it's cancer? - No, it isn't.
Yes!
a small tumorin his brain stem, causing paraneoplastic syndrome.
he needs plasmapheresis.
can you give that to him?
no, I'm sorry, I completely disagree with Dr. House.
please shut up. - I don't.
which means I can treat him.
let him. Let him.
is that what you want? - Absolutely.
would you send up a couple of bellboys?
I got the transfer papers. Plasmapheresis is all set up. Are you okay?
fresh infusion of macho. You like?
I can't move, and she's worried about his boo-boo?
what were you doing up there, anyway?
antiquing. I found you a te Victorian corset. Come by later, I'll tie you up.
is he hitting on her?
if she turns around, she's into him too. And ther yeah.
sorry I didn't show up in Middletown. I didn't get the message.
probably because there was no message.
I've decided to accept your resignation.
uh, I thought we were past this. I decided to stay.
no, you didn't. You had it decided for you.
so now you're stuck here with a boss who knows that you want to be somewhere else.
which means you're no longer motivated to impress me, which means you're no longer motivated to come up with good ideas.
unless I'm wrong.
save the cheer leader. Save your world.
I got it from here.
I thought you already solved this. Are you thinking you might be wrong?
what's going on?
Hey, just curious... what were you driving up to Middletown for?
what do you care? - Why does he care?
because I'm your friend.
I was buying a guitar. - Yeah, I heard that.
it used to belong to a guitarist who died in a motorcycle accident.
it just reeks of you screwing with people.
your crash was ten miles from the Orange County Progressive Pain Vlinic.
you live ten miles from Mary's dress shop.
and yet, that's not even on my list of reasons that I think you'resecretly a transvestite.
if you're going to another state to get more narcotics
he's on drugs? - I went to visit your ex-ex-ex-wife...
what? - Who lives in Thompson ridge.
I let her know about the extra money you're making on the lecture circuit.
so she'll be sure to adjust your alimony.
you wouldn't do that. - Yeah. I wouldn't do that.
would you?
you guys are friends?
shouldn't we be entertaining our patient?
I performed Euripides with sock puppets.
you just missed it.
house said we should.
the mind is like a muscle.
if you don't exercise it, it'll atrophy, just like anything else.
whoever's with him needs to talk.
keep his mind active, and it'll show House you still care.
not sure if I do.
jeez, you're my doctor? - Then why don't you just quit?
I'm not sure I want to do that, either.
maybe you should figure it out before House figures it out for you.
Yeah, maybe you should have your midlife crisis after I'm better.
we'll be right back. - Wait.
wait, what did you just see?
do you drink? - He's a roofer.
alcohol hardly proves your theory.
Marchiafava bignami disease fits.
LFT's are normal.
speak English. Is it fixable? What does that mean?
that hurts.
no tremors.
how much do you drink? A six-pack a day?
I hate beer, I don't even drink beer. - Maybe more or less.
or maybe something else.
it may not be alcohol at all.
street opiates can also cause locked-in
I don't get high.
so, eitherwe play 20, 000 questions with every street drug, or instead of talking to him, we talk to the lesion.
talk to me. - We're going to biopsy the brain stem?
for the record, that doesn't count as your inspired idea.
it's sort of where I was heading.
you're going to cut into my head? Why?
stop treating me like a piece of furniture!
I have a right to know what's going on!
Where's that going?
blood in your urine clogged up your old catheter.
peeing blood? That must be what the insecure doctor saw.
every new clue gets us closer to the answer.
damn it. - The surgery will get us more clues.
you have visitors.
no. Oh, Molly.
come in.
daddy! - Daddy!
I told you not to bring them.
well, they wanted to see their father.
I can't even hug them.
they can handle it.
it's going to be all right.
you're not so sure anymore, are you?
they must've told you that it's dangerous.
that I could die.
and that's why you brought them in here...
I got an A+ on my test.
to see me before I die.
I love you, daddy.
daddy loves you too.
I want to show you my drawings.
kids just want a dad.
even if he's just a lump.
maybe you should go now.
Oh, no. They can stay, please. Let them stay.
Bye, daddy.
Bye, daddy.
sorry. You were crying.
damn.
we're going to put you out, just so we can drill the hole.
Oh, that's very thoughtful of you.
then we'll wake you back up.
we'll need you to answer some simple yes or no questions while we're cutting, - to make sure we're not cutting... - It seems to be working.
deep breaths.
in about ten seconds, you'll feel lightheaded.
and by now...
you should be floating high with lucy in the sky.
how come I'm not better?
God's not supposed to work in trial and error.
God's mistakes are well-documented.
if he'd done everything right the first time, there'd have been one plague and zero great floods.
those were because of human mistakes.
you think your doctor has an apartment on mount Olympus?
God put me with you for a reason.
I'm gonna be all right still, right?
I don't know.
Lee. You with me now?
easy questions. You'll be done before you know it.
is this equation correct?
what, so if you make a mistake, I'm not going to know that anymore?
are these lines parallel? Spatial relationships intact.
take a look at this circle.
is more than half of it shaded?
of course.
don't forget to blink. Is more than half of the circle shaded?
sorry, yes.
look at me, Lee. Again.
is more than half of this circle shaded?
blink. Come on, lee, blink. - Foreman, back out.
Whyan't I blink? Why can't I blink?
why aren't his eyes moving?
two options: My neurologist screwed up, or else something the hospital lawyer's going to have to come up with when you sue us.
blinking and eye movements are controlled by a small cluster of nerves, just millimeters from the biopsy site.
but he's still in there, right? I mean, he just can't communicate?
it's possible.
also possible is that the surgery caused so much swelling in his brain stem, that he's just gone.
he had one way to communicate, and now that's gone. Well played.
brain biopsy revealed severe damage to the myelin sheath. Question is, why?
epstein barr, picorna viruses, malaria.
he runs a business, meets a lot of people, he could've picked up rotavirus.
did he report having bloody diarrhea?
the wife's not sure, says he doesn't complain.
did you ask him?
we've prioritized. He can only blink, a real history would've taken weeks.
if he had epste barr, he'd have belly pains.
if he had picorna virus, he'd have headaches.
five other yes/no questions, and maybe we'd know what treatment to give.
and what treatment would kill him.
unless he's already dead.
maybe there's another way.
brain computer interface-- better known as BCI.
the go is to get you to move that cursor with your mind.
when you think "up," the computer records the pattern.
think "up" enough times, it eventually learns what you're thinking.
so... start thinking "up.
you in there?
are you trying?
I called the ex-ex-ex-wife.
she was at a sweat lodge in new Mexico last week.
what were you really doing in New York?
you know how you hate it when I meddle in your lies?
I mean your life.
why are you being so evasive?
unless you have something to evade.
interesting.
this has nothing to do with you, your ex-wife, or my pain.
I was heading to the down-state correctional facility in Fishkill.
one of your hookers arrange a conjugal visit?
it's where Foreman's brother is being held.
this is going to mean months of sleepless nights, wondering if I could've done something differently.
maybe it's not that I'm sick of House.
it's that I'm sick of being scared out of my mind to go to work every day.
sorry.
did that just...
was that you?
are you really in there?
I knew you were in there.
I was scared. - Tha god.
I am scared.
Molly, I love you so much.
have you had any bloody diarrhea in the last two weeks?
rotavirus out.
any recent joint pain
epstein barr's out.
have you traveled out of the country lately?
what about inside the country?
he was in St. Louis.
good. Could be missouri malaria. Let's start treatment.
he was--he was there.
the machine must not be working.
either that, or he lied to you about it. People do that sometimes.
for example, I just lied to him about missouri malaria.
did you go to St. Louis?
I should've told you. Why didn't I just tell you?
down.
when you weren't in St. Louis for two days,
I assume you were getting some strange for two days.
so does she. You have to tell her I wasn't.
amazing.
a man who only has two blips at his disposal can still lie.
I'm not lying.
if you were getting some really strange strange, you could've contracted neu infection went to your brain, froze you right up.
good news is it's treatable.
you'll be up and moving in time to sign the divorce papers.
why would I tell you the truth about being in St. Louis, and then not tell you the truth about this?
he just admitted he wasn't in St. Louis in front of his wife, and you think he's lying when she's not even in here?
I'm liking this one more and more. Don't fire him.
were you out of the state?
I never left.
were you within 20 miles of your house?
Yes.
were you within five miles? - Yes.
within two miles? - Yes.
did you stay at a hotel? - No.
you had to sleep somewhere. Your car?
no.
a friend's house?
Yes. Yes.
that narrows it down, depending on how popular you are.
tell the wife to stop crying, get in here.
he says that when he was supposed to be in St. Louis, he was staying at a friend's house.
really. - Yes.
let's assume that you believe him for the moment.
name your friends within two miles. - Martin and kim's?
no.
guess someone who doesn't have a wife.
Dave? - Yes.
got an address?
if this is where he got sick, someone else here should have symptoms.
not if Lee was the only one coming down to the basement.
furnace is rusty, but no gas leaks.
resumes and cover letters here...
some are weeks old.
he's been spending time here for a while.
business wasn't going good.
I didn't want you and the kids to worry.
I was trying to protect you.
I wish you could hear me.
I wish I could make all of this better.
looks like he temped a few times. As a janitor.
factory out on route 10.
factory foreman says they make rechargeable batteries.
mostly for cell phones.
big step down from running your own business, to sweeping up.
doing what I had to do.
metal filings.
judging by the color, I'd say cadmium.
which he'd aerosolize with the broom, then right into his lungs.
heavy metal poisoning--explains everything.
the chelation will scrub the heavy metals out of your blood.
if we are right about the cause, we should see some movement in about a day or so.
can't put this thing on turbo?
I'm getting a little anxious in here.
somebody will be here at all times to, uh, irrigate our eyes, keep you company.
hopefully, it'll help make the time go quicker.
my eyes still feel really dry.
thank you... for thinking "up.
for helping me find you in there.
man, when you moved that cursor...
bought my first girlfriend a necklace. It was silver.
it cost 180 bucks--had to save for six months.
she hated it.
really, seriously?
did you tell this story to someone who could walk away?
never bought another girlfriend jewelry again.
until Dr. Hadley. - You're dating her?
you might want to start all your stories with that.
same thing... she didn't even wear it.
the diamond thing, she was wearing it the other day.
if she doesn't like it, she doesn't like it.
apparently, I suckat picking out jewelry, but least have the guts to tell me.
okay, getting boring again.
how long until we know if this treatment is working?
you lied to me.
I wasn't having an affair.
so we needed money. Who cares?
last time business was slow, you got migraines every day.
why would you do that to me?
I'm sorry, I was--I was stupid. I was--don't go! Don't!
damn it, somebody... put "I'm sorry"on this stupid computer.
my eye is killing me.
I want to keep my job.
great. All you got to do is come up with a good idea.
how about we hook the guy's brain into a computer, so he can communicate?
that's a great idea.
for the guy who invented the computer that can read minds.
your idea was to use his idea.
you didn't come up with it. No one else came up with it.
if I didn't re-establish communication, we never would've found
what's interesting is why you're here now.
not when I gave you the ultimatum.
was it something the patient said?
I realized that what we do here... terrifies me.
and...
overcoming that is the only way I can matter.
Kutner found the battery factory.
Kutner came up with the cadmium.
maybe you don't matter.
I'm going to close your eyes so you can get some sleep.
hopefully, when you wake up, we'll see some improvement.
hope that includes my eye feeling better.
hand me the flourescein stain.
what's that mean?
epithelium looks torn.
these drops sting.
I'm going to close your left eye to keep it protected.
I'm going to blink your eye a few times to distribute the dye.
ulcerative keratitis.
means it's not cadmium poisoning.
which means you don't know what's wrong. Again.
when's the last time you changed that dressing?
judging by the smell of it, I'd say never.
he's locked-in, his kidneys blew a fuse, and now his eye is oozing puss.
I assume you went over all of that with your team.
I also assume they didn't have any brilliant ideas, or you wouldn't still be muttering to yourself.
this is going to hurt.
the way he's losing his myelin makes an infection most likely. Could be varicella
road debris has come to the surface. I'm going to have to scrub it out.
but the initial acyclovir would've treated that.
which pushes me towards an autoimmune disease.
like behcet'S.
here... this is going to hurt even more. Take two now, two later.
Oops.
of course, if the varicella was resistant, it wouldn't matter what they did up in Middletown.
do an lp.
you've been in the ER too long.
when the patient had head trauma, white blood cells only indicate that he had head trauma.
or you could use the lp for something useful.
if you find polys, it's varicella. Lymphs, behcet'S.
why did I fire you again?
you didn't. I quit.
you weren't visiting Foreman's brother, either.
busy...
Kutner's doing an lp, so I have to focus.
I had prison security check visitor logs, phone records.
you've never had any contact with anyone at Fishkill.
so, I ask again...
what were you doing up in Middletown?
you know what's more interesting than what I was doing?
the reason you are so obsessed with what I was doing.
stop deflecting, House. - Says the deflector.
the reason I was up there...
is the reason you're scared I was up there.
I was checking out your dirty, little secret.
how long have you been sleeping with her?
how did you know?
your only secrets are the girls you find embarrassing.
and the only embarrassing girl you've met recently is the one at your brother's cuckoo facility.
we've only been out a few times.
she's a care giver. Like all of your other failed exes.
and someone who takes care of your brother.
who was the last person who took care of your brother?
you think this is oedipal?
actually, I was thinking masturbatory.
I guess your mom took care of him first.
so, the safe course is to gouge your eyes out.
lp stands for lumbar puncture.
we use this needle tocollect fluid from your spine.
that's a really big needle.
you're going to feel some extreme pressure in your back.
I already feel pressure in my front-- my chest hurts.
something's wrong. No, my chest!
something's wrong. I think I'm hav-- oh, god!
call the code.
there is no god.
you don't know what's wrong with me
it doesn't seem that way.
so am I dead?
not yet.
but you're about to be.
okay.
Charging... clear.
again... clear.
he's back.
no. No. Let me go.
he can't fix me.
I've been here for three days, everything hurts.
it's okay, just--just stop fighting.
she's got to go on with her life.
the kids don't need this. I can't do nothing for them--I can't
scratch this foot--wow, that really, really itches.
so we put ina temporary pacer. - Shut up, shut up.
he's trying to talk.
is something bothering you?
if there's still tightness in your chest, it's expected.
is it your eye?
why is he saying "no"three times? You only asked one question.
maybe he's not saying "no," maybe he's saying "down.
are you saying that the pain is lower? How low, your leg?
your foot?
left foot?
check his--let me see now-- yeah, his right foot.
no bruises, no rashes, no cuts.
then there should beno pain.
is there a tingling sensation?
is it itching?
itchy foot means liver failure.
the liver's fine. His enzymes have been normal since we admitted him.
I didn't say "failing,"I said "failure." Just like you.
liver's like a cruise ship taking on water.
as it starts to sink, it sends out an S. O.S.
only instead of radio waves, it uses enzymes.
the more enzymes in the blood, the worse the liver is.
and once the ship has sunk, there's no more S. O.S.
you think the liver's fine, but it's already at the bottom of the sea.
so dying liver released toxins, damaged the nerves, led to locked-in syndrome.
now we just need to know what's causing the liver failure.
liver, plus eye, plus kidney-- most likely sclerosing cholangitis.
Oh, god, if only Taub had said that, it would've been a happy ending.
do a biopsy to confirm.
I'm going to numb up the area where we'll go in for the punch biopsy.
Where's the new bracelet?
she was wearing the bracelet?
you didn't notice that I was wearing it?
because you weren't.
he noticed, and you didn't?
if you don't like it, it's fine, it's not a big deal.
I like it, that's the point.
I'd rather have itat home in the jewelry box than getting peed on at work.
you got the patient's urine on that arm?
when I was putting in the catheter. Why?
you've got a rash.
the bracelet's real. - I figured.
so what if the rash isn't just a rash?
what if it's an infection?
if there were rats in that basement, then the liver failure could be caused by leptospirosis.
it transfers through urine. Rat pee to him, his pee to you.
the infection would need an entry point.
look for any recent scratches, cuts.
look. Next to his fingernail.
the infection destroyed your liver, which released toxins that caused the locked-in syndrome.
you were dying of a paper cut.
I hope you're right this time.
we found rats in your buddy Dave's basement.
tested positive for leptospirosis.
that means we're on the right treatment.
so... try moving a finger.
your brain needs to get used to doing its job again. Try harder.
I'm sure you've lost hope.
I know we've told you several times that we knew what this was, but this time we're right.
concentrate. Move one finger for me.
welcome back.
I did it.
rat pee. Very nice idea.
who came up with it?
I did.
good.
you okay with him claiming the credit?
it was his idea. He saw the rash
if he did, he'd have hung a "mission accomplished" banner in my outer office.
don't toy with him. If you're going to fire him
the fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie.
that's all I needed to know. Rat pee.
that's a very nice idea.
house. You left this in my office.
no, I didn't.
so either I have a hole in my pocket
Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it.
because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it.
you would've thrown her right in my face.
you underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.
and then there were all those calls you weren't taking in front of me.
so I dialed the number of the calls you weren't taking.
you're seeing a psychiatrist.
you had no right to invade my privacy.
is--is that...? - Yeah. It's irony.
God sent you.
suddenly, you're not so fascinating.
you're spying on your team.
prioritize, Wilson.
is that what you really want to torture me about right now?
I don't want to torture you at all. I think this is a great thing.
not something you have to drive an hour out of town to shroud in mystery.
whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time.
maybe I'll discover that my childhood wasn't perfect.
so your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went.
which leads me to believe that maybe something else has changed.
maybe you think you can change.
I credit Cuddy with that.
not much credit to take, because I'm not going back.
Oh, House, please...
I assume you went because you're tired of screwing up every chance.
you get at happiness. - New contact. Delete contact.
do not let the fact that I found out about it
don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work.
you'll end up alone.
Bye.
I... I want to be alone...
with my wife.
I'm a selfish S. O.B.
I... I never got you to Rio.
there was always...
one more problem at the stores.
you deserve better than that.
I love you.
I always have.
I'm ready. - It's okay.
I know...
somebody...
help her!
help her!
no anaphylaxis, lung issues, or tracheal lesions.
tox screen was clean for coke and amphetamines.
I will give you 30 reasons, one for each pound that caused the apnea which enflamed the epiglottis.
why is our rainbow coalition missing brown and bi?
thirteen's with a patient, and Kutner's dog's sick.
he should be in by lunch.
no apnea because no sleeping problems when she's sleeping.
she spent the last six months caring for her husband who's dying of heart failure.
reason 31--whatever whacked the husband's heart is also whacking her airway.
and... Oh, good. I thought maybe Kutner was home nursing the rib you broke when you elbowed your way in for credit on the last patient.
I contributed.
and the patient's illness wasn't caused by her husband unless lung cancer's contagious.
interesting. Not about the patient. That was kinda dull.
I thought maybe you were lying to cover for Kutner, which sounds noble, except you're doing it out of guilt instead of love.
she visited her sister in Hawaii about six months ago, just before her husband got sick.
could've picked up melioidosis from one of the islands.
would have jumped to the husband and finished off him and his lame immune system.
no tumors, no drugs, no bacteria.
leaves viral-- varicella zoster.
start her on iv fluids and acyclovir.
can't. She's demanding to be released so she can get home to her husband.
how sweet. They can die together.
instead of separately, 40 years apart.
she claims he got stronger as soon as she stopped br
the mind can heal the body.
seeing his wife in distress might have actually slowed down his death.
or he just had an adrenaline surge when he saw his chance to hit the singles' market.
send her home. - We don't need to.
I had an idea... all by myself.
Eddie? - Found him loitering in the lobby.
you're still with me.
where the hell else am I gonna go?
and now, with your permission, we'd like to try to make you better.
the pageant starts in an hour.
you have to do something.
there's something wrong inside her head.
it's like she has no idea what's going on around her.
I thought she was just flirting with me.
I can fix it, but it's gonna cost you... $3. 75.
I'm not just gonna give you my coffee.
think of it as costa rican sober juice.
she's drunk?
that little minty scent hiding beneath the rose petal perfume and the cherry blossom moisturizer and the morning dew hair spray.
you sneak into mommy's bathroom and gulp some of her mouthwash?
gotta be perfect.
you spit it out?
mommy doesn't.
treatment worked. Charlotte's breathing's back to normal. She's being discharged.
she can resume her vigil over her husband who started fading again.
win some, lose some.
and strictly speaking, since he's not my patient, win some.
look at the time. It's half past, Taub was lying about Kutner.
he probably went to a comic book fest, spent the night at some wonder woman's lair.
I'm sure he'll... - Find out what or who he's doing.
either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to write it under "reason for termination.
that Kutner? - Charlotte.
02 sat and s-t are normal. It's not her airway.
you're okay. - Don't worry about me. She's in pain.
pulse is rabid and regular.
no fluid in her lungs. - What's happening?
I don't know.
Kutner. It's Foreman and thirteen.
where are you going?
house didn't ask us to find out where he wasn't.
if you want climb a fifth floor fire escape...
this might be faster.
Man/boy heaven.
surprised he ever leaves.
there's nothing on his calendar.
his pager's still here.
Oh, god.
I need an ambulance at 410 Willis, apartmen5c.
28-year-old male. Single gunshot wound to the right temple.
no pulse!
alert Princeton Plainsboro. Have a trauma unit ready.
his pupils dilated. His head's swollen.
still no pulse. Come on, Kutner! - Let me try.
he's cold.
he didn't say anything... to any of you.
family problems...
bad relationship, financial pressures?
his parents were shot right in front of him.
parents are ancient history.
not to someone who actually cares.
he didn't slit his wrists and...
peacefully drift away--he shot himself.
he didn't leave a note.
that means panic.
which could have been preempted if the idiots who worked alongside him for 80 hours a week had seen this coming.
you're blaming us?
just trying to figure it out.
we would have helped him, if he had reached out to us. He didn't.
we should have picked up on something.
this isn't our fault!
something like 25% of suicidal people show no outward signs of depression.
no.
25% of suicidal people have friends who didn't notice anything and don't want to feel guilty.
killing himself also kills all other options, makes Kutner an idiot.
so pity, yes, but guilt, no.
that's what you wanna tell yourself.
we still have a patient. Actually, two.
one worsening, one who should be worsening.
you can't be in denial about Kutner and the husband.
its possible Eddie's body is willing itself to live.
well, call the tabloids.
tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function.
maybe we should pass this file off to another doctor.
and the next one too?
the one after that?
how many files till its okay that Kutner's dead?
cardiac enzymes means she didn't have a heart attack.
no vision problems means no mitochondrial disease.
could be a metabolic disorder, acidosis.
blood ph was normal.
Polyserositis would inflame the membranes near her epiglottis and the heart's pericardium, causing the chest pain.
I'm sorry.
I've hired a grief counselor whom I'm sure none of you will see, and I'm offering time off, which I'm sure none of you will take.
but just know it's available.
Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin.
if you'd rather not deal with this case... - I'm fine...
despite what wilson will say.
he hasn't come to you?
pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings.
I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don't have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.
you didn't even have an inkling?
I know his fantasy football team cratered.
figured he'd gotten over it.
well...
sorry for your loss.
Thanks. But it's not my loss.
then I'm sorry you don't think it is.
patient's membranes aren't gonna heal themselves.
Taub went to run the treatment.
we'd like to go see Kutner's parents.
I'll join you.
Polyserositis damages the protective covering around tissue and organs.
the indomethacin is simply an anti-inflammatory, but it should fix it.
just make the pain stop.
close your eyes.
now...
pretend you...
finally made it down to rio.
you're on the balcony of A...
some fancy hotel.
you never talk like this.
Yeah, just... shut up and let me do this.
and you're on that balcony, and you're watching the Mardi Gras.
it's called carnival.
and I don't wanna go without you.
I want you to.
and I want it to be everything you've ever dreamed of.
sorry to interrupt... but I'd like to run one more test...
on you.
this is the first day we got him. He was six.
sweetest little boy you ever met.
must have been scary...
going through a trauma and then being handed off to a new family.
we kept telling him to call us Richard and Julia, but it was always mr. and mrs. Kutner.
and on his ninth birthday, we gave him a chemistry set.
lawrence always loved blowing things up.
and he said, "Thanks, mom. Thanks, dad."
that's who we were from then on.
he was pretty special.
we were lucky to have him.
you spent the most time with him.
he spoke so highly of all of you.
do you have any idea?
wish we did. We all...
it was his name.
he was conflicted, didn't know where he fit in.
being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours.
we encouraged him to hold on to his heritage.
it's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when everyone sees you as Lawrence Kutner.
it was his idea to take our name.
then you should have said no. - House.
all his anglo name gave him was the illusion that he was someone he wasn't.
you were being emotional, not rational.
you didn't understand him.
we loved that boy, you son of a bitch.
you wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain.
when he looked happy, you assumed the pain had gone.
it just got buried deeper...
leaving him tormented about who he was until finally he put a bullet
go back to the hospital.
I'm sorry about your son.
indomethacin had no effect. She's still in pain. Rules out polyserositis.
I ran a hormone panel on Eddie. His prolactin's above normal.
means he's actually improving.
body chemistry changes for all sorts of reasons
stress, fear--why not love?
but maybe he's going into some sort of remission.
you haven't asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.
if you had, I'm sure you'd have mentioned it.
or you're just afraid there is something relevant.
which would mean you could have saved him.
I don't buy that suicide is always a cry for help.
sometimes you just don't want help.
good thing you got some...
or you'd have tried again and gotten it right.
she doesn't have wegener's.
kidney function's normal. It's not byssinosis.
it's not mitral valve stenosis. Nothing fits.
if it doesn't fit any diagnosis...
it just leaves one diagnosis.
I'm Dr. House. You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
his heart is too weak. Yours is too strong. Good news is it's fixable.
we induce a massive heart attack and kill off the extra muscle.
you wanna give me a heart attack?
it's only dangerous if your heart is normal size.
but since all the-- - Are you serious?
no.
this is actually very annoying, and I'm getting really bored of lying to patients to scare them into telling me the truth.
she's faking.
and yes, if she keeps faking, I'm going to eventually do something that will kill her.
how could she be... the wind pipe thing?
that was real. Treatment made her better.
but good for her was bad for you, which was bad for her, so she made herself bad.
it's all so simple.
she figured the sicker she was, the longer you'd hang on.
we haven't been this close for years.
I wanted to hang onto that.
Oh, please. People hate reruns.
it's my leg. I swear this is real!
what, you pinky swear, or you just plain swear? Because...
how can she fake that?
she can't.
so... what can shred an epiglottis and make muscle disappear?
Mr. and mrs. Kutner.
they caused Kutner's death. Why not charlotte's?
mourning period's over. Foreman's sense of irony is back.
I was wrong about the ethnic reason.
step one--change your name back.
step two--if step one fails, move to Bangalore.
step 14--if step 13 doesn't work, kill yourself.
so what now--you gonna insult your way through his rolodex till you find someone with an answer?
I've been polite to the friends I've called, all of whom were useless.
they weren't useless. They just didn't know anything more than we did.
tomato, tomato.
M. S. Weakens myelin sheath, compromises nerve conduction.
I'm talking about charlotte, the one who's still alive.
you two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm M. S.
and you run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.
did you let me hire a pervert?
well, it would hypocritical of me not to.
Kutner's police background check from when he started.
he was charged with indecent exposure.
Kutner streaked at the Penn-dart mouth football game.
precisely the kind of thing you'd expect him to do.
it's okay. You should be upset.
he thought like you, pushed boundaries like you.
if he thought like me...
he would have known that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it.
just a few more minutes, then we'll get you back to Eddie.
what's it like, 30 years with the same man?
great for me. Good for him, I hope.
you don't think he loves you?
I think he always loved me in his way.
just not in the "spend time with me or show emotion or any affection for me" sort of way.
why did you stay?
I didn't need him to feel about me the way I did about him.
love... doesn't...
I've heard stories of cancer patients going into spontaneous remission.
you think this might be that spoof thing?
it's unlikely, but you never know.
if I just had a little more time...
be with charlotte, try and do better by her.
Yeah, maybe.
you don't think I mean it.
I think you mean it now.
I think it's much easier to mean it than to do anything about it.
chamber walls are barely moving. I'm sorry.
he needs a friend.
I can't... deal with this and House.
you need a friend too.
you couldn't give a crap what I need.
you just want someone to take care of him.
he told Kutner's parents it was their fault.
ruptured spleen. Means it's not M. S.
what are you doing here?
waiting for you to fix her spleen so we can biopsy it for rheumatoid arthritis.
I'll do it. Go home.
she's not your patient.
and Kutner wasn't my friend.
Kutner wanted to die. Charlotte doesn't.
so in a contest for my concern and interest, she wins.
okay, either you're a cold-hearted bastard or you're too miserable to face it.
go home and cry.
it's not rheumatoid arthritis. Her liver's scarred.
whatever she's got, it's spreading.
for the record, I'm uncomfortable violating a dead colleague's dignity.
it's only violating it if you find something.
good to see you.
what are we looking for?
he was hiding.
Why?
shame? Fear? Are you okay?
it's okay not to be okay.
colonial warrior blaster. Number one one.
he'd have spent months tracking this down. He had passions.
he was obviously in pain.
does it really matter why?
he hung the bad with the good.
his loss beside a reminder of what he'd gained.
means he was open about the pain.
should mean that if it got worse, he had no reason to hide it.
here's how we're gonna handle this, House.
we're gonna leave here and go to the closest bar and drink and tell stories about the time Kutner almost blew up an O. R.
and pass out in our own sick.
sound like a plan?
what am I missing?
you've got that look.
you figured this out.
you're not here because you care about Kutner.
you're here because it's a mystery.
you're here for the puzzle.
what if I didn't miss anything?
cause there's nothing to miss?
he didn't kill himself. He was murdered.
epiglottis muscle, spleen, and now her liver, which is operating at 20% and deteriorating fast.
autoimmune hepatitis?
did you page foreman?
took up Cuddy's offer of time off.
normal thyroid means no hepatitis.
could be amyloidosis. Amyloid buildup hits the organs, tissue
her muscles wouldn't have atrophied.
you run the echo on the husband?
heart's still failing. The improvement was only temporary.
I prefer the less subtle answer: You were right, House.
So...less time proving why hubby isn't dead.
more time proving why Kutner is.
motives for murder.
house... it was a suicide. The police have already investigated.
they investigated what they saw, not what they didn't saw.
talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy.
and draft foreman.
he can make calls through his tears. - No.
is that no, I'm not calling my boyfriend, who apparently called my boss instead of me to say he wasn't coming in?
cause it's really not fair to have that much subtext in one syllable.
we all wanna know why Kutner did it.
but we're not gonna waste time chasing ghosts.
you're not remotely curious?
only why a man who embraces the rational is suddenly pursuing the irrational.
she could have alpha-1anti-trypsin deficiency.
run her aat proteins.
I'd like to be with Eddie.
it's too soon after your surgery.
you can ask that someone get your organs if you die, right?
even if the donor bank turned them down?
individual donors can bypass the registry, but there are a lot of other factors...
blood type-- - I've given him blood.
it's not just-- - Please.
if I go before him, I want you to give him my heart.
this isn't over yet.
for me.
but he has no hope, has he?
Yes.
Remy hadley. I also answer to thirteen.
I sometimes sleep with you.
I know I should have called.
I just need some time. - Alone?
I've worked through a lot of bad stuff in my life.
always done it solo.
so I should go.
I'm sorry. - Okay.
I. T. been trying to close out Kutner's email account.
apparently, someone's still logged onto it.
it wasn't hard to figure out that his password was Kutner.
he did what they tell you not to.
he wasn't murdered. - But his parents were.
and the guy who killed them is coming up for parole.
he's coming up for parole.
he's not o on parole.
Kutner testified at every one of his hearings.
the guy wouldn't be the first to see the clock ticking.
he was killed by his own gun.
which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense.
in the temple. Cops found residue.
right, the murderer would never try to make it look like suicide.
that would be unethical.
you haven't asked about my patient.
you're waiting on aat protein results.
means you checked up to see that I'm still on it.
you wanna transfer the case, but you won't, because you think it's the only thing that's holding me together.
relax. Either I'm right or I'm wrong. We'll know soon enough.
find what's killing your patient...
and then I'll find you another patient.
what happened?
nurses found her like this.
she broke into the cart and injected whatever she could grab.
dumb way to look worse for Eddie.
she wasn't trying to look worse.
she was trying to kill herself.
she's stable, but whatever was left of her liver is definitely shot now.
and there's no change in Eddie.
So...thanks to her idiotic move, she's dead in 24 hours if she doesn't get a new liver.
it was selfless. She loves him.
how does that disagree with what I just said?
test was negative for aat deficiency.
myelofibrosis fits, but testing takes at least 48 hours.
we should try a partial donation from a live donor.
damage is too severe. She needs a whole new liver.
no diagnosis, no liver.
no liver, no living.
what do you know?
it is myelofrosis.
says so right here.
who wants to tell Cuddy?
how many times have you lied to the transplant committee?
just twice. - How many times has it worked?
I... don't quite see how that's relevant.
cheese it. It's the coppers.
we're not just gonna leave them to die while you fixate on Kutner.
technically, he's not our patient.
so I'm really only leaving her to die.
we've already explored the usual options.
shouldn't we at least explore unusual ones?
Absolutely. Don't worry. This is why god gave me two ears.
Kutner would say we should just come clean with Cuddy.
if only he were here to say that.
I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, "hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting-
need an incurable romantic to talk to incurable romantic.
Kutner wasn't murdered.
you deduce that by removing your sun glasses to the strains of a "who" song?
suicide means you could have helped him. Murder lets you off the hook.
needs a liver. Has a liver.
he can make a partial donation.
the faster he agrees, the faster she gets to not die.
partial won't be enough. She needs a whole liver.
and he'd never survive the procedure.
nice symmetry, huh?
he dies on the table, and you give her his whole liver.
if he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love.
I thought he should talk to someone who spoke the language.
you want me to die on the table.
we don't want you to.
your wife needs you to.
my heart?
is still dying. You have a couple days at most.
but this could buy use enough time to save her.
when can I say good-bye?
you can't.
if she knew what we were planning, would she be okay?
she'll resent me.
she'll be alive. Nothing else matters.
you can't do the transplant.
only if he said no.
but your urgent hovering means he said yes.
his fingers have nodules. I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.
or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.
obese man with lung cancer-- two easy explanations for his heart failure.
no dules can mean something else, somethg curable.
go back to the E. R.
my thanks to you and your cold feet.
what's going on? I'm giving you a shot at a cool result
better yet, a chance to prove other doctors idiotic.
except you're wrong.
you figure that out by taking f your sunglasses to the strains of a "who" song?
the guy who killed Kutner's parents died of an aneurism two months ago.
Kutner hid from everyone.
you didn't get a chance to save him--no one did.
run the tests. Find out if you have a chance to save Eddie.
bad news.
love can't save you.
on the other hand...
mold can.
your heart failure was caused by a fungal infection called cardiac blastomycosis.
it started as nodules in your lungs which every doc, except one, mistook for cancer.
it's very rare, very curable.
I'm starting you on itraconazole.
but how come I was getting better without the medicine?
your emotional state bumped your catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.
my emotional state?
three months of treatment, you'll be back to your buff, chiseled self.
I don't want the treatment.
do the transplant.
but you'd be trading...
the certainty that you'll live for the uncertainty that she'll live.
I was ready to di anyway.
now you get to be nicer to your next wife.
if you won't do it... release me.
and when I get hit by a car and show up in your morgue, you can give her my liver then.
you're basically asking us to commit murder.
I was yesterday too.
there's a difference when he has 20 years to live instead of two days.
not really. Not legally.
that's your way of convincing us to do this, by saying it's no more immoral?
the idiot is gonna do this with or without us.
this way we can protect the organ.
we should be protecting him.
so we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?
I'm not doing this.
I will.
we've already had one pointless death.
Eddie... what's going on?
I don't know. He just came and got me.
your husband has a curable disease, but he wants to die so he can give you his liver.
are you okay with that, or would you rather he take the treatment?
you son of a bitch!
Eddie, don't! - You have to let me do this.
Chaotte, can you hear me?
she spiked a fever. Lp shows her white cells through the roof.
she's infected everywhere.
I should fire you.
just did what you failed to do
convince Eddie to live and let his wife die.
infection means we have a new clue.
a full two or three hours to figure it out.
sarcoidosis hits the spleen and the liver.
she would have lung issues.
Scleroder ma inflames the tissue.
no skin or GI problems.
what is she hiding? - You don't know
either we have all the clues and we're idiots or we don't have all the clues.
possible exposure, people, places.
both.
bad lie.
did you really think the beaches in Hawaii were just like the beaches in Rio?
the disease bearing sand flies are completely different.
she's never been to Rio.
who'd you go with?
why are you doing this?
I don't actually need to know who it was.
I just need to know that you went...
so we can know that you have visceral leishmaniasis.
but since lancelot there was ready to die for you...
he might want the answer to both.
last year...
it was nobody you knew.
rio was supposed to be ours.
I got tired of waiting.
I'm so sorry.
start her on antimony.
and have Cuddy find her a liver.
they were ready to die...
but for guilt, not love.
you can't feel that much guilt without love.
new York Mercy's medevacing the liver.
it should be here... - Tell them to turn around.
Charlotte's treatment isn't taking.
we diagnosed it too late.
everyone's heading over to Kutner's funeral.
you're welcome to ride with me.
I'm gonna stay with charlotte.
she bought you some time to save Eddie.
it'll give her death some meaning.
no. It won't.
I wrong about you.
no, you weren't. - You're in pain.
and you're romanticizing... again.
you worked with him every day for two years, and you never saw this coming.
no one saw it coming.
but you see everything coming.
this has never been about what you missed.
this is about why you missed it.
you're terrified that you're losing your gift, losing...
who you are.
and I'm terrified of what you'd do then.
unless you feel there's more to do here to cure me...
don't you have a funeral to go to?
Bye.
I... I want to be alone...
with my wife.
I'm a selfish S. O.B.
I... I never got you to Rio.
there was always...
one more problem at the stores.
you deserve better than that.
I love you.
I always have.
I'm ready. - It's okay.
I know...
somebody...
help her!
help her!
no anaphylaxis, lung issues, or tracheal lesions.
tox screen was clean for coke and amphetamines.
I will give you 30 reasons, one for each pound that caused the apnea which enflamed the epiglottis.
why is our rainbow coalition missing brown and bi?
thirteen's with a patient, and Kutner's dog's sick.
he should be in by lunch.
no apnea because no sleeping problems when she's sleeping.
she spent the last six months caring for her husband who's dying of heart failure.
reason 31--whatever whacked the husband's heart is also whacking her airway.
and... Oh, good. I thought maybe Kutner was home nursing the rib you broke when you elbowed your way in for credit on the last patient.
I contributed.
and the patient's illness wasn't caused by her husband unless lung cancer's contagious.
interesting. Not about the patient. That was kinda dull.
I thought maybe you were lying to cover for Kutner, which sounds noble, except you're doing it out of guilt instead of love.
she visited her sister in Hawaii about six months ago, just before her husband got sick.
could've picked up melioidosis from one of the islands.
would have jumped to the husband and finished off him and his lame immune system.
no tumors, no drugs, no bacteria.
leaves viral-- varicella zoster.
start her on iv fluids and acyclovir.
can't. She's demanding to be released so she can get home to her husband.
how sweet. They can die together.
instead of separately, 40 years apart.
she claims he got stronger as soon as she stopped br
the mind can heal the body.
seeing his wife in distress might have actually slowed down his death.
or he just had an adrenaline surge when he saw his chance to hit the singles' market.
send her home. - We don't need to.
I had an idea... all by myself.
Eddie? - Found him loitering in the lobby.
you're still with me.
where the hell else am I gonna go?
and now, with your permission, we'd like to try to make you better.
the pageant starts in an hour.
you have to do something.
there's something wrong inside her head.
it's like she has no idea what's going on around her.
I thought she was just flirting with me.
I can fix it, but it's gonna cost you... $3. 75.
I'm not just gonna give you my coffee.
think of it as costa rican sober juice.
she's drunk?
that little minty scent hiding beneath the rose petal perfume and the cherry blossom moisturizer and the morning dew hair spray.
you sneak into mommy's bathroom and gulp some of her mouthwash?
gotta be perfect.
you spit it out?
mommy doesn't.
treatment worked. Charlotte's breathing's back to normal. She's being discharged.
she can resume her vigil over her husband who started fading again.
win some, lose some.
and strictly speaking, since he's not my patient, win some.
look at the time. It's half past, Taub was lying about Kutner.
he probably went to a comic book fest, spent the night at some wonder woman's lair.
I'm sure he'll... - Find out what or who he's doing.
either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to write it under "reason for termination.
that Kutner? - Charlotte.
02 sat and s-t are normal. It's not her airway.
you're okay. - Don't worry about me. She's in pain.
pulse is rabid and regular.
no fluid in her lungs. - What's happening?
I don't know.
Kutner. It's Foreman and thirteen.
where are you going?
house didn't ask us to find out where he wasn't.
if you want climb a fifth floor fire escape...
this might be faster.
Man/boy heaven.
surprised he ever leaves.
there's nothing on his calendar.
his pager's still here.
Oh, god.
I need an ambulance at 410 Willis, apartmen5c.
28-year-old male. Single gunshot wound to the right temple.
no pulse!
alert Princeton Plainsboro. Have a trauma unit ready.
his pupils dilated. His head's swollen.
still no pulse. Come on, Kutner! - Let me try.
he's cold.
he didn't say anything... to any of you.
family problems...
bad relationship, financial pressures?
his parents were shot right in front of him.
parents are ancient history.
not to someone who actually cares.
he didn't slit his wrists and...
peacefully drift away--he shot himself.
he didn't leave a note.
that means panic.
which could have been preempted if the idiots who worked alongside him for 80 hours a week had seen this coming.
you're blaming us?
just trying to figure it out.
we would have helped him, if he had reached out to us. He didn't.
we should have picked up on something.
this isn't our fault!
something like 25% of suicidal people show no outward signs of depression.
no.
25% of suicidal people have friends who didn't notice anything and don't want to feel guilty.
killing himself also kills all other options, makes Kutner an idiot.
so pity, yes, but guilt, no.
that's what you wanna tell yourself.
we still have a patient. Actually, two.
one worsening, one who should be worsening.
you can't be in denial about Kutner and the husband.
its possible Eddie's body is willing itself to live.
well, call the tabloids.
tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function.
maybe we should pass this file off to another doctor.
and the next one too?
the one after that?
how many files till its okay that Kutner's dead?
cardiac enzymes means she didn't have a heart attack.
no vision problems means no mitochondrial disease.
could be a metabolic disorder, acidosis.
blood ph was normal.
Polyserositis would inflame the membranes near her epiglottis and the heart's pericardium, causing the chest pain.
I'm sorry.
I've hired a grief counselor whom I'm sure none of you will see, and I'm offering time off, which I'm sure none of you will take.
but just know it's available.
Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin.
if you'd rather not deal with this case... - I'm fine...
despite what wilson will say.
he hasn't come to you?
pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings.
I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don't have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.
you didn't even have an inkling?
I know his fantasy football team cratered.
figured he'd gotten over it.
well...
sorry for your loss.
Thanks. But it's not my loss.
then I'm sorry you don't think it is.
patient's membranes aren't gonna heal themselves.
Taub went to run the treatment.
we'd like to go see Kutner's parents.
I'll join you.
Polyserositis damages the protective covering around tissue and organs.
the indomethacin is simply an anti-inflammatory, but it should fix it.
just make the pain stop.
close your eyes.
now...
pretend you...
finally made it down to rio.
you're on the balcony of A...
some fancy hotel.
you never talk like this.
Yeah, just... shut up and let me do this.
and you're on that balcony, and you're watching the Mardi Gras.
it's called carnival.
and I don't wanna go without you.
I want you to.
and I want it to be everything you've ever dreamed of.
sorry to interrupt... but I'd like to run one more test...
on you.
this is the first day we got him. He was six.
sweetest little boy you ever met.
must have been scary...
going through a trauma and then being handed off to a new family.
we kept telling him to call us Richard and Julia, but it was always mr. and mrs. Kutner.
and on his ninth birthday, we gave him a chemistry set.
lawrence always loved blowing things up.
and he said, "Thanks, mom. Thanks, dad."
that's who we were from then on.
he was pretty special.
we were lucky to have him.
you spent the most time with him.
he spoke so highly of all of you.
do you have any idea?
wish we did. We all...
it was his name.
he was conflicted, didn't know where he fit in.
being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours.
we encouraged him to hold on to his heritage.
it's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when everyone sees you as Lawrence Kutner.
it was his idea to take our name.
then you should have said no. - House.
all his anglo name gave him was the illusion that he was someone he wasn't.
you were being emotional, not rational.
you didn't understand him.
we loved that boy, you son of a bitch.
you wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain.
when he looked happy, you assumed the pain had gone.
it just got buried deeper...
leaving him tormented about who he was until finally he put a bullet
go back to the hospital.
I'm sorry about your son.
indomethacin had no effect. She's still in pain. Rules out polyserositis.
I ran a hormone panel on Eddie. His prolactin's above normal.
means he's actually improving.
body chemistry changes for all sorts of reasons
stress, fear--why not love?
but maybe he's going into some sort of remission.
you haven't asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.
if you had, I'm sure you'd have mentioned it.
or you're just afraid there is something relevant.
which would mean you could have saved him.
I don't buy that suicide is always a cry for help.
sometimes you just don't want help.
good thing you got some...
or you'd have tried again and gotten it right.
she doesn't have wegener's.
kidney function's normal. It's not byssinosis.
it's not mitral valve stenosis. Nothing fits.
if it doesn't fit any diagnosis...
it just leaves one diagnosis.
I'm Dr. House. You have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
his heart is too weak. Yours is too strong. Good news is it's fixable.
we induce a massive heart attack and kill off the extra muscle.
you wanna give me a heart attack?
it's only dangerous if your heart is normal size.
but since all the-- - Are you serious?
no.
this is actually very annoying, and I'm getting really bored of lying to patients to scare them into telling me the truth.
she's faking.
and yes, if she keeps faking, I'm going to eventually do something that will kill her.
how could she be... the wind pipe thing?
that was real. Treatment made her better.
but good for her was bad for you, which was bad for her, so she made herself bad.
it's all so simple.
she figured the sicker she was, the longer you'd hang on.
we haven't been this close for years.
I wanted to hang onto that.
Oh, please. People hate reruns.
it's my leg. I swear this is real!
what, you pinky swear, or you just plain swear? Because...
how can she fake that?
she can't.
so... what can shred an epiglottis and make muscle disappear?
Mr. and mrs. Kutner.
they caused Kutner's death. Why not charlotte's?
mourning period's over. Foreman's sense of irony is back.
I was wrong about the ethnic reason.
step one--change your name back.
step two--if step one fails, move to Bangalore.
step 14--if step 13 doesn't work, kill yourself.
so what now--you gonna insult your way through his rolodex till you find someone with an answer?
I've been polite to the friends I've called, all of whom were useless.
they weren't useless. They just didn't know anything more than we did.
tomato, tomato.
M. S. Weakens myelin sheath, compromises nerve conduction.
I'm talking about charlotte, the one who's still alive.
you two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm M. S.
and you run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.
did you let me hire a pervert?
well, it would hypocritical of me not to.
Kutner's police background check from when he started.
he was charged with indecent exposure.
Kutner streaked at the Penn-dart mouth football game.
precisely the kind of thing you'd expect him to do.
it's okay. You should be upset.
he thought like you, pushed boundaries like you.
if he thought like me...
he would have known that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it.
just a few more minutes, then we'll get you back to Eddie.
what's it like, 30 years with the same man?
great for me. Good for him, I hope.
you don't think he loves you?
I think he always loved me in his way.
just not in the "spend time with me or show emotion or any affection for me" sort of way.
why did you stay?
I didn't need him to feel about me the way I did about him.
love... doesn't...
I've heard stories of cancer patients going into spontaneous remission.
you think this might be that spoof thing?
it's unlikely, but you never know.
if I just had a little more time...
be with charlotte, try and do better by her.
Yeah, maybe.
you don't think I mean it.
I think you mean it now.
I think it's much easier to mean it than to do anything about it.
chamber walls are barely moving. I'm sorry.
he needs a friend.
I can't... deal with this and House.
you need a friend too.
you couldn't give a crap what I need.
you just want someone to take care of him.
he told Kutner's parents it was their fault.
ruptured spleen. Means it's not M. S.
what are you doing here?
waiting for you to fix her spleen so we can biopsy it for rheumatoid arthritis.
I'll do it. Go home.
she's not your patient.
and Kutner wasn't my friend.
Kutner wanted to die. Charlotte doesn't.
so in a contest for my concern and interest, she wins.
okay, either you're a cold-hearted bastard or you're too miserable to face it.
go home and cry.
it's not rheumatoid arthritis. Her liver's scarred.
whatever she's got, it's spreading.
for the record, I'm uncomfortable violating a dead colleague's dignity.
it's only violating it if you find something.
good to see you.
what are we looking for?
he was hiding.
Why?
shame? Fear? Are you okay?
it's okay not to be okay.
colonial warrior blaster. Number one one.
he'd have spent months tracking this down. He had passions.
he was obviously in pain.
does it really matter why?
he hung the bad with the good.
his loss beside a reminder of what he'd gained.
means he was open about the pain.
should mean that if it got worse, he had no reason to hide it.
here's how we're gonna handle this, House.
we're gonna leave here and go to the closest bar and drink and tell stories about the time Kutner almost blew up an O. R.
and pass out in our own sick.
sound like a plan?
what am I missing?
you've got that look.
you figured this out.
you're not here because you care about Kutner.
you're here because it's a mystery.
you're here for the puzzle.
what if I didn't miss anything?
cause there's nothing to miss?
he didn't kill himself. He was murdered.
epiglottis muscle, spleen, and now her liver, which is operating at 20% and deteriorating fast.
autoimmune hepatitis?
did you page foreman?
took up Cuddy's offer of time off.
normal thyroid means no hepatitis.
could be amyloidosis. Amyloid buildup hits the organs, tissue
her muscles wouldn't have atrophied.
you run the echo on the husband?
heart's still failing. The improvement was only temporary.
I prefer the less subtle answer: You were right, House.
So...less time proving why hubby isn't dead.
more time proving why Kutner is.
motives for murder.
house... it was a suicide. The police have already investigated.
they investigated what they saw, not what they didn't saw.
talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy.
and draft foreman.
he can make calls through his tears. - No.
is that no, I'm not calling my boyfriend, who apparently called my boss instead of me to say he wasn't coming in?
cause it's really not fair to have that much subtext in one syllable.
we all wanna know why Kutner did it.
but we're not gonna waste time chasing ghosts.
you're not remotely curious?
only why a man who embraces the rational is suddenly pursuing the irrational.
she could have alpha-1anti-trypsin deficiency.
run her aat proteins.
I'd like to be with Eddie.
it's too soon after your surgery.
you can ask that someone get your organs if you die, right?
even if the donor bank turned them down?
individual donors can bypass the registry, but there are a lot of other factors...
blood type-- - I've given him blood.
it's not just-- - Please.
if I go before him, I want you to give him my heart.
this isn't over yet.
for me.
but he has no hope, has he?
Yes.
Remy hadley. I also answer to thirteen.
I sometimes sleep with you.
I know I should have called.
I just need some time. - Alone?
I've worked through a lot of bad stuff in my life.
always done it solo.
so I should go.
I'm sorry. - Okay.
I. T. been trying to close out Kutner's email account.
apparently, someone's still logged onto it.
it wasn't hard to figure out that his password was Kutner.
he did what they tell you not to.
he wasn't murdered. - But his parents were.
and the guy who killed them is coming up for parole.
he's coming up for parole.
he's not o on parole.
Kutner testified at every one of his hearings.
the guy wouldn't be the first to see the clock ticking.
he was killed by his own gun.
which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense.
in the temple. Cops found residue.
right, the murderer would never try to make it look like suicide.
that would be unethical.
you haven't asked about my patient.
you're waiting on aat protein results.
means you checked up to see that I'm still on it.
you wanna transfer the case, but you won't, because you think it's the only thing that's holding me together.
relax. Either I'm right or I'm wrong. We'll know soon enough.
find what's killing your patient...
and then I'll find you another patient.
what happened?
nurses found her like this.
she broke into the cart and injected whatever she could grab.
dumb way to look worse for Eddie.
she wasn't trying to look worse.
she was trying to kill herself.
she's stable, but whatever was left of her liver is definitely shot now.
and there's no change in Eddie.
So...thanks to her idiotic move, she's dead in 24 hours if she doesn't get a new liver.
it was selfless. She loves him.
how does that disagree with what I just said?
test was negative for aat deficiency.
myelofibrosis fits, but testing takes at least 48 hours.
we should try a partial donation from a live donor.
damage is too severe. She needs a whole new liver.
no diagnosis, no liver.
no liver, no living.
what do you know?
it is myelofrosis.
says so right here.
who wants to tell Cuddy?
how many times have you lied to the transplant committee?
just twice. - How many times has it worked?
I... don't quite see how that's relevant.
cheese it. It's the coppers.
we're not just gonna leave them to die while you fixate on Kutner.
technically, he's not our patient.
so I'm really only leaving her to die.
we've already explored the usual options.
shouldn't we at least explore unusual ones?
Absolutely. Don't worry. This is why god gave me two ears.
Kutner would say we should just come clean with Cuddy.
if only he were here to say that.
I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, "hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting-
need an incurable romantic to talk to incurable romantic.
Kutner wasn't murdered.
you deduce that by removing your sun glasses to the strains of a "who" song?
suicide means you could have helped him. Murder lets you off the hook.
needs a liver. Has a liver.
he can make a partial donation.
the faster he agrees, the faster she gets to not die.
partial won't be enough. She needs a whole liver.
and he'd never survive the procedure.
nice symmetry, huh?
he dies on the table, and you give her his whole liver.
if he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love.
I thought he should talk to someone who spoke the language.
you want me to die on the table.
we don't want you to.
your wife needs you to.
my heart?
is still dying. You have a couple days at most.
but this could buy use enough time to save her.
when can I say good-bye?
you can't.
if she knew what we were planning, would she be okay?
she'll resent me.
she'll be alive. Nothing else matters.
you can't do the transplant.
only if he said no.
but your urgent hovering means he said yes.
his fingers have nodules. I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.
or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.
obese man with lung cancer-- two easy explanations for his heart failure.
no dules can mean something else, somethg curable.
go back to the E. R.
my thanks to you and your cold feet.
what's going on? I'm giving you a shot at a cool result
better yet, a chance to prove other doctors idiotic.
except you're wrong.
you figure that out by taking f your sunglasses to the strains of a "who" song?
the guy who killed Kutner's parents died of an aneurism two months ago.
Kutner hid from everyone.
you didn't get a chance to save him--no one did.
run the tests. Find out if you have a chance to save Eddie.
bad news.
love can't save you.
on the other hand...
mold can.
your heart failure was caused by a fungal infection called cardiac blastomycosis.
it started as nodules in your lungs which every doc, except one, mistook for cancer.
it's very rare, very curable.
I'm starting you on itraconazole.
but how come I was getting better without the medicine?
your emotional state bumped your catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.
my emotional state?
three months of treatment, you'll be back to your buff, chiseled self.
I don't want the treatment.
do the transplant.
but you'd be trading...
the certainty that you'll live for the uncertainty that she'll live.
I was ready to di anyway.
now you get to be nicer to your next wife.
if you won't do it... release me.
and when I get hit by a car and show up in your morgue, you can give her my liver then.
you're basically asking us to commit murder.
I was yesterday too.
there's a difference when he has 20 years to live instead of two days.
not really. Not legally.
that's your way of convincing us to do this, by saying it's no more immoral?
the idiot is gonna do this with or without us.
this way we can protect the organ.
we should be protecting him.
so we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?
I'm not doing this.
I will.
we've already had one pointless death.
Eddie... what's going on?
I don't know. He just came and got me.
your husband has a curable disease, but he wants to die so he can give you his liver.
are you okay with that, or would you rather he take the treatment?
you son of a bitch!
Eddie, don't! - You have to let me do this.
Chaotte, can you hear me?
she spiked a fever. Lp shows her white cells through the roof.
she's infected everywhere.
I should fire you.
just did what you failed to do
convince Eddie to live and let his wife die.
infection means we have a new clue.
a full two or three hours to figure it out.
sarcoidosis hits the spleen and the liver.
she would have lung issues.
Scleroder ma inflames the tissue.
no skin or GI problems.
what is she hiding? - You don't know
either we have all the clues and we're idiots or we don't have all the clues.
possible exposure, people, places.
both.
bad lie.
did you really think the beaches in Hawaii were just like the beaches in Rio?
the disease bearing sand flies are completely different.
she's never been to Rio.
who'd you go with?
why are you doing this?
I don't actually need to know who it was.
I just need to know that you went...
so we can know that you have visceral leishmaniasis.
but since lancelot there was ready to die for you...
he might want the answer to both.
last year...
it was nobody you knew.
rio was supposed to be ours.
I got tired of waiting.
I'm so sorry.
start her on antimony.
and have Cuddy find her a liver.
they were ready to die...
but for guilt, not love.
you can't feel that much guilt without love.
new York Mercy's medevacing the liver.
it should be here... - Tell them to turn around.
Charlotte's treatment isn't taking.
we diagnosed it too late.
everyone's heading over to Kutner's funeral.
you're welcome to ride with me.
I'm gonna stay with charlotte.
she bought you some time to save Eddie.
it'll give her death some meaning.
no. It won't.
I wrong about you.
no, you weren't. - You're in pain.
and you're romanticizing... again.
you worked with him every day for two years, and you never saw this coming.
no one saw it coming.
but you see everything coming.
this has never been about what you missed.
this is about why you missed it.
you're terrified that you're losing your gift, losing...
who you are.
and I'm terrified of what you'd do then.
unless you feel there's more to do here to cure me...
don't you have a funeral to go to?
it's way too fast. - It felt good.
if we could clear the stage quickly, please.
Maury, it's too fast.
it's exactly the same. - Then slow it down.
everything all right, Jeremy? - Sure.
ready whenever you are.
from the allegro, please.
what's his problem?
his back's not 100%.
he can't talk to the conductor like that.
no, he can't. She could.
you okay with the lift?
I'll be fine unless you mess up the timing.
my timing is perfect.
it was last night.
moment of truth.
damn it.
Penelope, are you all right?
She...she can't breathe! Call a doctor!
are you gonna ignore me all day again?
I help you.
you tried to kill Chase.
doing what you wanted, that's all, boss.
I exist. - No, you don't.
I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away.
saying it is one thing. Living it is another.
you're not rational, not completely.
put the phone on the receiver, send the hookers home, and get dressed. We've got a case.
I'm taking a personal day.
21-year-old star at the New York ballet collapsed on stage.
I love ballet.
but as someone may have mentioned, I'm taking a personal day.
Cuddy said get your ass in or you're fired.
she's not gonna fire me.
she's not gonna fire you if you don't go to work? - Okay.
how long do you figure till I just disappear?
hold on.
no tumors or punctures in the lungs, no bruising, no sign of trauma, no STDs.
and supplemental oxygen's only gotten her saturation level to 60.
lungs keep collapsing despite a chest tube.
E.R. ruled out the obvious.
white count and temp were normal, so no pneumonia.
coffee's burnt. Thirteen's wearing cherry-flavored lip gloss.
Foreman's staring at you. Any of that helpful?
STD?
we just said the tests were negative. You think we should
no. - She's a dancer. What about dehydration?
what about a pulmonary contusion?
C.T.showed no inflammation on the lungs.
what about dehydration?
B.U.N. and creatinine are elevated but within range.
Hey, I'm just the irrational part of your brain, but elevated means high, right?
dehydration could hide an infection.
dehydration could hide an infection.
go treat her for the obvious...I.V. fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.
we're like Magic and Kareem.
Mr. Pietramala, you have kidney cancer.
is that a bad one? I mean, they're all bad, but
the door was closed for a reason.
well, now it's open for a reason. We need to talk.
he...he just told me I have kidney cancer.
then you'll obviously need a moment to process.
I'm hallucinating.
I'm...I'll be right back.
I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check everything I do.
you can't treat patients if...- It's got to be sleep apnea.
I get a good night's sleep, and I still feel exhausted.
lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucinations.
do you have any other neurological symptoms?
I don't think so.
aphasia? - No.
memory loss? - No.
irritability? - Yeah, that one!
don't deflect. He cares about you. You care about him. - You shouldn't be practicing.
at least...- Enough!
don't give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.
who were you talking to?
someone who's not actually here.
beyond that seems irrelevant.
your mind made a choice. It means something.
you know he's just gonna keep asking.
good choice. He feels bad.
you gonna help me or not?
Yeah.
I could eat from this place seven days a week.
we practically do.
you can order tomorrow night. Do you want some wine?
no, thanks.
I have my husband's sperm.
your dead husband's?
we froze it when he got diagnosed.
and you kept it?
all this time?
I used to think if I didn't find anyone, then
you found someone. - I know, but...
what if it goes wrong?
what if I turn out to be a radical anarchist with a secret family and that I age backwards?
nobody plans on getting divorced.
I didn't plan on my husband dying. But he did.
so you...you're saying you want a prenup...
in liquid form.
what if it's not sleep apnea?
trauma from your motorcycle accident? Vicodin abuse?
you need to be admitted.
I know you're wrong about sleep apnea, which means you know you're wrong about sleep apnea.
you're scared. Tell him you're scared.
I can't sleep with you here.
did it work?
do you see someone standing beside me?
no.
then, no.
so what's next on your list of things it's not?
patient's not responding to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.
so run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.
we can't do a bronc because her lungs are still collapsed.
Transtracheal aspiration.
that's basically waterboarding.
it is pretty radical. - It's a great idea.
regular radical, me radical, or me out of my mind radical?
somewhere between regular and you.
so what's the problem?
everything okay?
no. Our patient can't breathe.
either do the test or come up with a better one.
so we're down to infection, trauma, M.S. schizophrenia, or pills.
schizophrenia usually manifests younger.
that's why it's further down the list.
I can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.
an infection can be treated... cured.
means you still got a job. Means you still got a life.
it doesn't make it a better idea, just a nicer one.
this the rational you talking?
can't do this on my own.
when we inject the water, it's gonna feel like you're drowning.
but it'll be over in a few seconds.
then it'll be better? - A little.
hold her shoulders down a little.
ready?
you're doing great. Here comes the liquid.
Taub. - I slipped.
Oh, no. - What?
her skin came off.
her skin is sloughing off faster than we can replace it with the artificial skin.
could be autoimmune.
A.N.A. was negative.
focus on the lungs.
you want us to ignore the fact that she's lost 80% of her skin?
we know it's not lung cancer.
could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs.
get an ultrasound of her liver.
if you find masses, get a biopsy.
we can't just ignore the skin.
it's obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now.
I don't think it is a symptom.
I think we caused it.
by doing what?
I prescribed antibiotics.
toxic epidermal necrolysis...that's a one-in-a-million reaction.
Yeah, well, maybe this is the one.
get swabs of her old skin to confirm.
where the hell were you?
I do have a practice.
ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.
are you sure?
about to be.
I'm sorry. - I feel guilty.
you didn't do anything wrong. You prescribed antibiotics.
any other doctor would've done the exact same thing.
any other doctor? Words can hurt, you know.
I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn't make any sense...
unless there's something wrong the limbic area of my brain.
guilt as a symptom?
it's consistent with M.S.
and since the blood tests were negative, I have to apologize.
if I feel better, then you're right. I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing...
it means my limbic brain is shot.
I'm Dr. House.
anyone explain to you your status?
they found a mass in my liver...cancer.
they said they think they can treat it and that the skin is starting to take.
I'll be able to dance again.
she's half dead, and she's wondering if she'll ever plie again?
healthy priorities. Let the mocking begin.
I'm sorry.
I... treated you for an infection before confirming that you had one.
that's why you lost your skin. I know you're in pain. I know that I caused it.
I'm sorry.
very nice.
thank you?
nothing.
maybe you don't mean it.
I meant it.
did you do a liver biopsy to confirm
couldn't. The artificial skin was too thin.
she'd bleed out.
why were you talking to the patient?
I think skinless women are hot.
do a transjugular liver biopsy.
if she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins.
did you just check with Wilson again?
no.
I felt nothing. It's M.S.
apologies aren't supposed to make you feel better.
they're supposed to make the other person feel better.
in order to make you feel better. - Fine.
you want to do an L.P. to confirm, or is guilt enough to start filling prescriptions?
last mass about a centimeter to your right.
problem?
short burst of flutter. We're almost done.
entering the right hepatic vein.
cameron kept her dead husband's sperm.
she doesn't like yours?
she likes his better.
or at least she wants to hang on to it in case mine is unfaithful or something.
advancing two centimeters.
you got to let her do it.
if you don't, you'll be stuck with her forever.
I want to be stuck with her forever.
she married a dying guy.
she has issues.
you cannot leave her ever, for any reason, 'cause then you're not just the guy who left her, you're the guy who killed her kids.
that's not a good rhythm. Get out.
narrow complex tachycardia...she's gonna crash.
liver biopsy was negative for cancer, but the procedure sent her heart into a-fib.
we don't know it was the biopsy that caused the heart problem.
maybe the heart caused the lungs to collapse.
why is Wilson here?
you were looking for cancer.
thought it'd be helpful if... - We didn't find cancer.
Yes, which you reported to me five seconds ago.
thought I'd let him finish his hors d'oeuvre before getting the bouncer to take care of him.
until we can regulate the heart, we can't get any meaningful pictures. So we can't tell
metoprolol can correct irregular heart...- Tried it. Didn't work.
is Cuddy making him oversee...- No.
heart's too irregular for MRI. Other scans would
then you're making him oversee your choices.
you don't trust yourself. Why?
Wilson, get out.
are you sure?
do I need your approval to throw you out?
you happy now?
there's only one time her heart's gonna be perfectly still for our pictures, and that's when she's dead.
if it's not M.S. severe mental illness and vicodin are all that's left.
mental illness means...
you can no longer practice medicine.
vicodin means detox, which means pain for the rest of your life, which means you can no longer practice medicine.
are you saying we should kill her?
no.
if we stopped her heart, we could get our pictures and then restart it.
what if we cat restart it?
then she stays dead.
we restart hearts all the time.
it'll take four minutes for us to MRI her entire heart.
and we only have three minutes until there's brain damage.
you sure about this?
Yeah.
we're gonna stop her heart so I can MRI it.
I think it was her idea.
pneumonia was her idea, and it almost killed the patient.
her? - Oops.
Kutner was secretly a woman. That's why he killed himself.
it's Amber.
your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?
Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours.
how about that? - It...raises questions.
it answers questions. - Who cares?
I've got competing ideas. They can't both be right.
everybody gets competing ideas. Everybody has doubts.
so is it regular radical, me radical, or me out of my mind radical?
it's on the upper end of you radical.
do you have any alternative?
nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.
then you're as safe as you can be.
great.
you get the L.P. results back?
Yeah. It's a big shock. You don't have M.S.
but while I had your blood sample, I checked vicodin levels was too high.
I need the pills.
not an argument. He knows that's not an argument.
it could still be schizophrenia. - House...
if you're on anti-psych meds, you're not gonna be able to practice. - I know.
you'd prefer electroshock therapy to rehab?
I'd prefer something that could actually work.
you're rationalizing. - No kidding.
I know that you're afraid of the pain, but electroshock
don't give me the cancer voice, that overly earnest tone.
heart attack, stroke, seizure, death, or worse.
worse? Double death?
you live, but you damage the only thing you care about... your rational mind.
I'll make some calls.
I'll actually be dead?
just your heart, just for a little while.
hopefully.
I had an idea.
stop having ideas.
insulin shock.
Yes. That's marginally less dangerous than E.C.T. puts you in a coma.
could cause...- Could work.
if you had ychosis, which you don't.
I've had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting, none of the symptoms of vicodin overdose.
Yeah, except the "I see dead people" thing.
I've been popping pills for years.
I've only been seeing things for days.
something changed.
vicodin addiction is still more likely.
so we're no longer dealing in absolutes.
house, I'll be up in five minutes.
then we can talk about how you'd rather be in a coma than in rehab.
actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful.
Why?
cause I'm about to put myself into insulin shock.
left atrium is fine. - Left coronary artery also fine.
we're almost at three minutes. - Keep going.
chordae tendineae clear. - Right atrium is fine.
I got to start her back up.
we have some time. - We're over.
right coronary artery is fine.
the three-minute threshold is a guideline. - She might have less. We have to stop.
what's that by the aorta?
I don't see anything. - I'm restarting her heart.
that's a shadow. Two centimeters
you're only scared because you know this is gonna work.
we're over three minutes.
I need glucose in here!
you could've died.
it worked.
where are my pants?
are you sure?
she's been everywhere I've been for days.
she's not here, ergo...
this was not the next rational step.
now who's being biased?
you wanted me to detox as much as I wanted
I forgot how to do my zipper.
any other neurological deficits?
you don't seem to annoy me as much as usual.
not sure that's a deficit.
and... I'm all better.
is she really gone? - Absolutely.
I can feel myself repressing all kinds of ricky things.
I check out, don't I?
damn.
he didn't see anything. He saw an artifact on the monitor.
it was a shadow on her heart.
she'd already been technically dead for three minutes.
I thought keeping her alive took precedence over prolonging the photo op.
any brain damage?
no, all tests indicat...- Obviously you had more time.
best of luck.
I assume we can't kill her again and take more pictures.
uh, you'll want to check with Wilson? - Good one.
it's something, a lesion.
tumor, scar tissue.
could be an abscess, infection.
explains why it's invisible in the blood.
it's doing its damage behind closed doors, sealed off.
see, the problem with speculation is you make a spec out of "u" and some guy named "Lation," which really doesn't affect me at all.
we have to guess. It's all we've got. We can't do a biopsy.
last time we went into her heart, she had a major cardiac event.
which just leaves...
what are you looking for?
I don't know yet.
the picture doesn't change.
she lies there in pain.
he sits there worried.
nothing changes.
I just had an epiphany...
all by myself.
popped into my head out of nothing.
care to share?
he's too devoted.
too devoted? You think he feels guilty?
right, I'm being cynical.
people can care because they care, not because they cheated, theoretically true.
but gonorrhea fits better. - No. No STDs. We tested her.
you tested her blood. - That is the test.
that's not where her problem is.
gonorrhea disseminated to her heart, got walled off in an abscess.
it'd be invisible. - And...would look like a shadow.
no need to test her again, but we can check prince charming.
once you confirm, cut the abscess out of her heart.
here are your onion rings, extra well-done.
thank you, Molly.
and another beer when you get a chance. I'm celebrating.
alone?
thank goodness.
don't tell me. I was right.
Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.
and everyone's a winner.
he's not too happy about it.
he insists he's never cheated and must've gotten it from her.
don't think so.
timing would fit.
he's got no symptoms, and she's dying.
lying would fit too.
he's not hanging out in her room anymore.
what does it matter? You were right.
we're prepping her for surgery.
I saw guilt in him.
if he's not actually guilty... then I wasn't right. I was lucky.
house, you made a brilliant deduction about her heart.
and if I was just lucky...
enjoy yourself, it's later than you think, enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink, the years go by, as quickly as a wink, enjoy yourself.
Wilson... come get me.
it's later than you think
I know a nice facility outside Philly.
I went to undergrad with one of the directors.
Thanks.
how many shirts do I need?
they said three. They have laundry.
like living with mom again...delightful.
it's probably Foreman.
he's unavailable.
tell her the infection's made her septic.
we can't remove the abscess until we get her B.P. up.
and it's not responding to fluids. It's not
he's off the case.
patient okay? - Yeah.
he's lying.
why don't I feel scared?
I'd say you're unaware of what you're feeling at this moment.
I feel like crap.
my life is falling apart, but I don't feel scared...
not of the rehab anyway.
we've always been able to find a way to cheat.
it won't work.
you want it to work this time.
do we?
house... it's your only option.
what do I do if my only option won't work?
you don't give up.
it's either that or electroshock every six hours.
good night, Wilson.
what if we put her on a heart-lung machine?
she's septic. We don't need a heart-lung machine.
we need a "blood vessel holder together" machine.
we could try high-dose dopamine.
it's a vasoconstrictor.
it'll close the blood vessels so she won't bleed out.
her heart can't take that much dopamine. It'll explode.
and if we don't use the dopamine, it'll implode.
is House really done?
it sounded that way.
dopamine it is.
it's late, and I'm tired.
can we get to the talking part of this conversation?
I quit.
great.
my nanny is off the clock at 7: 30, so...
your week off, bigger desk...tighter nurses uniforms, or whatever other stupid thing you're about to demand is gonna have to wait until
you can go suckle the little bastard child who makes you feel good about yourself.
screw you.
don't do this.
I'm hallucinating.
from the vicodin?
ruled out everything else.
we can, uh...admit you through the E.R. under a pseudonym.
no one has to... - I'll cheat...scam, find some way to keep using.
these people know what they're doing.
these people don't know me.
you do. - She's not your keeper.
she has no responsibility for you.
I need you.
let me call my babysitter.
blood pressure's 90 over 60. - We know.
I'm just saying. It's still 90 over 60. It's holding.
abscess is intact.
doesn't look like any of the surrounding tissue is affected.
she's gonna be fine.
doctor.
we've got a problem.
lie down. I'll get you some tea.
yeah... then I'll be better.
do you really think she hasn't searched this place for your secret stash?
I already did this room...
and the bathroom and your bedroom.
where should I look, in the kitchen?
coffee cup in...in the top shelf.
that was a test.
I already did the kitchen.
nicely played...she'll think you've come clean, given her everything.
there's more. - Don't!
you're hurting already. It'll only get worse.
house, you should tell me where it is now, because you won't have the will to tell me in two hours.
my shoes in the closet.
it's like I don't even know who you are anymore.
it's okay. Hold my hand.
am I okay?
we were able to successfully remove the abscess from your heart.
but the dopamine caused the blood vessels in your hands and feet to clamp shut.
we need to amputate, or the gangrene will spread.
you'll die.
my feet?
and your hands. I'm sorry.
no. I'm a dancer.
the tissue can't be saved.
no.
we know what House would do.
house would have never woken her up to ask for consent.
if you can't live with the answer, don't ask the question.
you're saying we should accept her decision?
bold idea, I know.
maybe we can get the boyfriend to convince her to do it.
Yeah, boyfriends get everything they want.
forget it. The boyfriend doesn't want to talk to her anymore.
where are you going? - Home. The case is over.
no, it's not.
not until we come up with something that might work.
it's a shame that she might die because House has some personal crap to work through.
technically, if she dies, it's because House has some personal crap to work through, and we weren't smart enough to get the answer without him.
false alarm. - Drink this.
that's your advice...drink this?
it's ginger. It'll ease the nausea.
you know what would calm the nausea?
Vicodin... marijuana... a coma.
Oh, don't pretend you didn't see it.
I saw it, which means you saw it.
send her away.
too bitter.
I already had enough bitter.
I'll add some honey.
you're pathetic.
if you want the pill, just send her home.
but you can't, because that would be admitting defeat to her.
now, this is interesting.
if you take the pill, you don't deserve her.
if you secretly take the pill, you don't deserve anyone.
No!
No! No!
this isn't gonna work.
it might work. That's all we're going for. Vasodilators can
big jump from reopening to reanimating.
I'm out of the ulnar.
I'm not seeing any clearing. This won't work.
this probably won't work.
radial artery's really tight. - Don't go too fast.
if it clots, she loses the hand.
if it clot, she's dead.
I can't believe it. - What?
it might be working.
can you stop? The breathing.
air goes in, air goes out.
hen use ur nose.
you're supposed to feel like crap.
you're doing great.
and after?
you come back to work.
what if I can't?
opioid dependency can make you think you have more pain than you really have.
you're gonna be okay.
you're telling me what I want to hear with no evidence.
I'm telling you what I believe to be the truth.
with no evidence.
you're hardly the most unbiased observer.
neither are you.
I'm your hospital's biggest asset.
is that why you think I'm here?
it's why you're here. It's why you're lying to me about
I haven't lied to you in 20 years.
sure you have.
which means that you just said that because you want to tell me what you lied to me about 20 years ago.
you're an ass. - Am I wrong?
I wasn't in your endocrinology class.
you sat next to me. I cheated off you on
I audited your endocrinology class.
why would you
because I thought you were an interesting lunatic even then.
I'm not here protecting hospital property.
we're alone.
E've been alone all night.
no, I mean Amber.
she's gone.
Where's Jeremy?
he left.
you okay?
the surgery worked.
Congratulations.
I can't do it.
you have doubts.
you don't?
no.
well, that's naive.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I love you.
that's how I feel right now, but...
I don't... know.
I'll wait until you do.
I can't know. No one knows.
I do.
I'll see you in later?
I have some papers to push for you.
thank you.
you want to kiss me, don't you?
I always want to kiss you.
Mr. Randall?
they're here.
$52 million includes over $6 million already issued pursuant to the over-allotment option.
when can we close?
it would be subject to regulatory approval in both Toronto and...
I didn't say "how" , Oliver. I said, "when" .
what - You sure this is a direction you want to go, Roy?
this would move us from energy service into-- you don't think oil's going up?
of course it's gonna go up. The question is when.
the question is always when, and if we wait until the deal makes sense to everyone else, we're gonna be waiting in line behind everyone else.
all I'm saying is-- the same cover-your-ass crap you always say.
we're gonna have to wrap this up. I got to go.
where are you going? - Upstairs.
get the regulators on it. I want to close by the end of the month.
come on, Roy. There are ten other items on the agenda.
which will have to wait until next week.
you can't drag us all out of the office, get halfway through, and then just kick us out.
Yeah, I can.
the antibiotic treatment had no effect.
both the fever and the pain are getting worse, which means it's not clostridium difficult.
but you said that was the only diagnosis that made sense.
it was.
we need to get him to a hospital.
dad?
I don't want to go.
I know, buddy. But we may need to.
am I gonna die?
no, of course not.
how do you know?
well, I just do.
and I'm always right, aren't I?
Yeah.
I want House.
I understand, but I told you Dr. House isn't available.
Dr.-- Call him.
tell him I'll have a private jet pick him up from whatever island
he isn't on vacation.
Dr. Foreman's one of our best doctors.
is House in jail?
no. Foreman is currently working with two of House's most veteran associates.
rehab?
no.
Mr. Randall, your son will be in good hands.
my son...
...has already been in good hands, and he's still dying.
I'm through dealing with good.
I want the best and everyone I've asked says at's House.
so unless he's dead, comatose, or insane, I want him treating my son today.
you could have said no in good conscience.
the kid'll still be Foreman's patient, but his dad wants you making the decisions.
then he's not my patient.
you want to give me none of the responsibility and all of the liability?
which means I get-- oh, cool.
don't let him do anything crazy.
when is he getting his license back so we can stop playing this game?
maybe never. This game is fun.
you also need to prepare president Dibala's case for this week's morbidity and mortality conference.
Ohh, unfortunately I'm overdue a mani-pedi appointment.
not you. Foreman's department.
Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world.
we made the wrong call. He died. There's nothing to present.
it obviously garnered a lot of curiosity.
and we don't have more important things to do than satisfy everyone's idle curiosity?
it's not idle.
the question of how we deal with two possible diagnoses whose treatments are contraindicated is worth discussing.
abdominal pain increasing in severity equed frncy, fever, dehydration, diarrhea, weight loss.
mom died from kidney failure caused by type one diabetes, which has been ruled out.
17 doctors.
everything's been ruled out.
which means we have to re-rule out.
get a new history and physical.
unless that's crazy, boss.
you been out of the country or on any recent camping trips?
no camping.
but we were in montreal back in January.
we went to see the NHL all-star game for my birthday.
awesome.
Where's Dr. House?
in his office.
he's really more of a decider than a doer.
he's decided we should start over.
never know what previous doctors may have missed.
like this.
does that hurt more when I push there?
not really. - What is it
I'm not sure.
just keep it clean, simple.
we did a test that called into question our initial diagnosis, so we changed our mind.
and if they ask how the test was done?
why would they do that? It's a routine lab test.
routine lab tests don't involve blood you stole from a corpse to trick me into giving the guy the wrong treatment.
Yes, and if you brought that up, it'd certainly make for a lively debate about the morality of murdering murderers.
but since you burned the only evidence of that-- to cover for you, not me.
you're protected.
the decision was a coin flip. There was no rig or wrong answer.
the body's underground, 8,000 miles away. Nobody can prove anything.
that room will be filled, not because of the coin flip, not because of the patient, but because House's department screwed up.
they're gonna be like sharks in a chum-filled swimming pool and there's no way I'm jumping in unless I'm in a steel cage.
so what do you want?
I want to know you have everything covered.
got what covered?
we're just reviewing the Dibala case.
making sure we didn't miss anything.
we didn't. Except of course the thing that killed him.
he's constipated.
physical revealed a mass in his abdomen, so I repeated the x-ray.
old one was clean. New one shows that his colon's almost completely impacted.
obstruction would explain the pain.
think they just screwed up the old x-ray?
Nope.
Hirschsprung's?
it's a congenital disorder of the nerves in the colon.
very rare in your child's age, most doctors would never think of it.
and you came up with this? - It's House's idea.
we need a barium enema and biopsy to confirm.
let me guess.
it tastes really bad, but it's gonna make me feel a lot better.
actually, you're not gonna taste it.
you should try searching for "misty may digs for gold" .
make sure you put it in quotes.
I'm making travel plans.
just need to get way.
have some time to myself.
you getting the hint?
so that's it?
you're done with your little experiment with Foreman?
it wasn't an experiment. It was a relationship.
you may want to look into the difference.
I'm glad you're better, House.
I actually like working for you.
but I'm not coming back. - Good.
cause if you came back, Foreman would try and save the relationship and he'd give up being the boss.
are you here to try to save my relationship with Foreman?
God no. Trying to save my relationship with Foreman.
right now I'm Kobe playing the game I love however the hell I want.
Phil Jackson has to listen to everyone else bitch about it.
enjoy Cabo.
I'm going to Thailand.
Really?
interesting.
good-bye, House.- Good-bye, thirteen.
he's even hungry.
I'm starving.
still waiting for the biopsy results, but obviously it's a good sign.
you're gonna want to take it slow.
don't try to regain all the lost weight in one meal.
what's wrong
Jack, are you feeling--Jack?
Hey, Jack, you okay?
right eye's fixed. Lateral rectus palsy.
he's seizing.
need five milligrams of diazepam.
what's happening?
put that on his head and turn off the lights.
I need to see his optic disk. - Heart rate's elevated.
come on, come on, hold his head. - I'm trying.
wait! Where's House? - Mr. Randall, we need you to step back.
his optic disk is swollen. He's got intracranial hypertension.
furosemide. 20 milligrams IV.
we could intubate him-- need five more milligrams of diazepam.
DC the monitors. Push 500 milligrams phenytoin.
we can't push that much. - We got to remove the pressure or his brain could herniate.
Oh, my god.
50 milligrams of phenytoin.
page chase. Tell him to meet us in the O. R.
we need your consent.
what's happening to him?
pressure in his skull's too high.
if we don't reduce it, it could irrevocably damage his brain.
but he was just talking. He was smiling. - We need to drill burr holes.
drill into his head? - Phenytoin's not working.
paralyze him. Three milligrams pancuronium. Then intubate and hyperventilate.
Where's House?
house isn't here. Do we have your consent? Do we have your consent?
ready? One, two, three.
three milligrams pancuronium.
look at the monitors. He's still seizing.
we need to do this now.
go.
electrical seizure activity's stopped.
intracranial pressure's declining. Come on. Keep going.
pressure's down to eight - I'll tell the dad.
what happened?
I have no idea.
he hasn't had any more seizures, and cytological examination of the subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.
don't usually see brain damage after a rectal biopsy.
he was fine after the procedure.
no headaches. No mental status change.
wasn't anything we did. - It's not just his brain.
he's continuing to build up fluid in his abdominal cavity as well as the dura.
we've inserted shunts to drain it.
got to be some sort of systemic infection.
not after spending the last week getting pumped full of iv antibiotics.
notice anything odd about the shape of the fluid collection?
Oh, god, it's... the virgin Mary.
the edge should be tapered, lens shaped.
unless...
the dural layer was already separated from the brain when the fluid started to build up.
get a dural biopsy to confirm brain cancer.
nice catch.
Bangkok. Flight 799.
Bangkok. That sounds awesome. How long?
not sure yet.
luckily I have a friend who's staying at my place taking care of my dog.
he's really big, so he needs a lot of exercise.
what, you think I'm gonna rob the place?
no, of course not.
in case you haven't noticed, I have a job.
look, I'm sorry. I don't know you. You're either honest or dishonest.
I figured the safer choice is-- is to treat a stranger like an ass.
nice way to live your life...bitch.
I said I'm sorry.
Oh, hello.
I was wondering if there were any business class seats open that I could use my miles to upgrade to.
I don't know you, but I assumed I could trust you.
welcomed you in my car.
okay, you're a saint.
that's impossible. I confirmed my reservation last night.
so rebook it.
well, obviously it was a mistake on your end, not mine.
no, I'm on my way to the airport right now.
they didn't believe you, huh?
brain cancer?
we should know for sure by the morning.
our luck just keeps getting worse, huh?
treatment options are getting better every day.
there's no visible mass, so even if the biopsy comes back positive, we've caught it early.
Oh, so you're telling me this is good news?
I'm saying we will do whatever we can.
right.
sorry.
I got to go. Foreman needs more help with the m and m prep.
okay, I'll come up and help after I finish the biopsy.
we can handle it.
I'll see you at home later.
if you're here, I might as well be.
go home. Get some rest.
cause I'm gonna be waking you up as soon as I get home.
stay out of my life.
okay.
I know you canceled my reservation.
you obviously saw me log in when you were spying on me in the coffee shop.
I was talking to you.
I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.
I'm not coming back on the team. - I don't want you back on the team.
I cannot work for, with, or around Foreman.
which is why I don't want you back on the team.
now that you're out of the picture, he's better than ever, which is gonna make me less miserable than ever, which is why neither of us gives a damn how, when, or on what island in the Bahamas you want to get from it all.
the Bahamas?
Costa Rica?
I told you Thailand.
I assumed you were lying, because it would have been idiotic of you to tell me truth.
yet another reason I have no use for you.
we've got a problem.
when Cameron sent Dibala's blood to the lab, she specifically asked for the anticentromere antibodies test.
so?
the printout they sent you included just the anticentromere antibodies, but the lab also did a full blood panel.
so, I'm not an idiot I obviously made sure the cadaver I got the sample from had the same blood type.
you apparently didn't check his cholesterol.
how far off?
Dibala didn't die of high cholesterol.
why would anyone even bother to compare the two reports?
the same reason I did.
because they're looking for anything we might have screwed up.
we could claim the blood analyzer broke.
we can't. Cameron documented that it was perfectly calibrated when she did the test.
so the numbers are off, it's weird. Who cares?
if it comes up, just act surprised like it's some irrelevasi curioty.
I can't do this.
I can't go in there and stack lie upon lie.
you've got to figure out a way to explain this.
missed you this morning.
Yeah, sorry. I needed to get in early. I didn't want to wake you.
I thought you did want to wake me. At least that's what you said last night.
I'm out of here. - No, no. I have the biopsy results.
it's not cancer.
how can so much be wrong with nothing being wrong?
since when has cancer been considered nothing?
I just said it's not cancer. The cell morphologies were all normal.
and so are the most recent ct scans.
on the other hand, andenocarcinoma of the stomach uld cause pain, constipation, nutritional deficiencies. That could cause seizures.
and wouldn't show on a ct.
you're right about the cancer, just wrong about the place.
continue to say nothing if you agree.
go scope h. Get another set of biopsies.
I'd get canceling her ticket if you then showed up with two more to somewhere better.
what are you talking about? - Or showed up at all.
but how does just ruining her plans get her to agree to yours?
you talking about thirteen? Where's she going?
well, nowhere this week, thanks to you.
I didn't stop her. I'm not gonna stop her.
I've already done all I could.
now all I can do is move on.
I think... I actually believe you.
if you're telling the truth, you're even more rational than I-- well, not more.
then again, more sane.
you're gonna be a good boss, boss.
I told you there's nothing wrong.
there's obviously something wrong and I'm not even saying we need to talk about it right now.
I just don't see why you have to deny it.
I'm not.
now you're denying you're denying.
no, I'm denying that there's anything to deny.
Robert, you can't do this. You can't hide things from me.
there's a problem with the Dibala M and M.
the hdl numbers on one of his early blood panels don't match a later panel.
that's weird.
Yeah.
it's no big deal.
cholesterol didn't have anything to do with his death, but, you know, after being let go from mercy and then that thing with thirteen's drug trial, Foreman's paranoid about people questioning the way he handled the case.
that's ridiculous. If anything, Foreman should be feeling secure.
he's the one who had the right diagnosis. We're the ones who talked him out of it.
I know.
don't tell him I told you. He doesn't want to show any signs of weakness, especially now that House is claiming he wants him to stay in charge.
all right.
so it's still cancer? It's just somewhere else?
that's what we're looking for, but it would explain all the symptoms and all the normal test and imaging studies.
got biopsies of the mucosa and the submucosa. Moving towards the pylorus.
it's my fault.
adenocarcinomas aren't caused by diet or environmental factors.
I inherited a $10 million pipeline business when I was 24.
by the time I was 30, it was worth over a billion.
since then, I have been involved in over 50 deals that make that first one look like a loser.
everything I do, everything I touch turns to gold...
except my family. First, my wife.
and now...my son.
this is my fault.
it's karma.
that's obviously not true.
he's seizing again.
get the scope out.
five milligrams diazepam.
how's the ICP? - It's...eight.
but the shunt's open and clear.
this isn't intracranial pressure.
then what the hell is it?
seizures stopped, but he hasn't regained consciousness.
no sign of any masses in his stomach or esophageal lining and he's still accumulating subdural and peritoneal fluid.
and every time we look to see where it's coming from, he starts seizing.
you think we're setting this off?
I think something is.
one of his stomach biopsies shows an arteriole partially occluded.
but with no abnormality in the other layers and no evidence of a cellular inflammatory reaction.
it's definitely not cancer.
then it has to be some sort of infection.
we already ruled out infection.
only because he was treated for it and got worse.
seems like a sound reason.- Unless it's a drug-resistant strain.
drug-resistant strain of what?
bacterial cultures, viral serologies, A.N. A. And A. N.C. A. Were all negative.
everything's negative. We obviously missed something.
maybe the seizures aren't a new symptom. They're an old one.
no doctor noticed a thrashing kid?
abdominal epilepsy.
the seizures would just ok like pain until it spread to his motor cortex.
it wouldn't explain the fevers.
protein malnutrition can cause fevers and nothing causes malnutrition like excruciating stomach pain that gets worse every time you eat.
I'd be a lot more certain if it was my idea, but it's the best we got.
start him on gabapentin.
hook him up to an intracranial eeg for continuous monitoring.
I gave him statins. - What?
if they ask about cholesterol, just say I prescribed a statin and forgot to put it in the chart.
you want to solve a problem in the records by creating another problem in the records?
it's not a problem with the records. It's a problem with my record keeping.
there's no way anyone can prove me wrong.
how'd you get access to the statins?
you gonna get someone in the pharmacy to confess to yet another record-keeping problem?
I saw an open cart. Just took it.
why would you steal a drug you could just as easily ask for?
cause I'm trying to get you off the hook.
a story that raises more questions than it answers only puts the hook deeper down my throat.
it's all right. I'll handle it.
how?
by telling the truth.
the truth is I don't have the time, I'm not in the mood, and I don't see the point.
you don't want to do the m and m because you're not in the mood?
this kid is dying and I've got House trying to push all his responsibilities onto me.
they're not his responsibilities. They're yours.
you're the one who wanted to be in charge. - I wanted to be in charge, not a figurehead.
then do the M and M. It's all yours.
you want me to get flogged? For what?
so you can have an academic debate about a diagnostic dilemma no one's ever gonna face again?
what the hell's going on here?
I just don't want to do the M and M.
did it work? - Not even close.
everything okay?
just waiting for whatever is about to go wrong.
thirteen called.
she have a theory that makes more sense than abdominal epilepsy?
she said someone hacked in her email account and canceled an airline reservation.
I'm guessing Foreman.
Really? You're accusing Foreman, not me?
cool.
you really want Foreman to stay in charge of the team?
makes sense.
he loves power, and I love puzzles.
you love power and puzzles.
true.
when I had them both.
it wasn't Foreman.
how do you know?
he said he's moved on.
and you believe him?
I believe that he believes it.
looks like it's time for me to get off the bench.
what's up?
are you Dr. House?
I understand you're a big fan.
I'll have my guy send over a signed glossy.
continuous eeg shows no interictal spikes. It's not abdominal epilepsy.
you paged me to tell me what it's not?
I paged you to show you this.
that I did not expect.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
darn it. I knew I should have stayed outside.
fantasy's always much better than the reality.
you think this is a joke?
that's my son, he's dying, and not one of you seem to have the slightest clue hwy.
I know.
that's why it's so interesting.
fever, stomach pain, seizures, peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spots.
could be an allergic reaction to one of his meds.
that suddenly developed eight hours after he started the meds?
if it's not cancer infection, it has to be autoimmune.
systemic lupus complicated by a cns vasculitis would explain the rash, fever, ascites
cns vasculitis would cause a stiff neck along with a headache.
and would've showed upon the dural biopsy.
what about polyarteritisnodosa? It can occur in kids.
except you can't have arteritis without inflammation.
okay, you come up with something better.
go on.
there was some inflammation in the skin biopsy, plus he's got elevated diastolic pressure.
it's barely elevated, which you'd expect given the number of procedure she's undergone.
well, barely is more than not barely.
not my decision.
but if it was, I'd say start him on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy.
if he's gonna have any real inflammation, it'll be down there.
cameron and I will do it. - Why?
it was Chase's idea.
kid's father is not gonna be happy about a fourth set of biopsies, and you've got a better rapport.
what's really going on here?
you need Chase to help you over-prep for the m and m?
Yes. - Then say so. Don't be a child.
is it on his penis kid's rash?
Yeah, why?
means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels.
that's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies.
it's not polyarteritis.
it's degos disease.
I'll do it.
your son has degos disease.
causes microblood vessels in the brain, skin, gi tract to break down, ffclot o.
it sometimes manifests early on with atrophic papuleson the penis.
in your son's case, we don't know why, but they came much later.
what's the treatment?
there isn't one.
it's incurable.
you're wrong.
you've already been wrong a bunch of times.
we've rechecked the biopsies. It's definitely degos.
I'm sorry. I wish there was something we could do.
how long?
not much longer.
what does that mean?
day at the most.
all right, great.
we need to talk.
unless it's life or death, it's gonna have to wait.
it's about Dibala.
well, let me rephrase. Unless it's a current life-- Foreman can't present the case at the m and M.
I know you guys are busy, but he's just gonna have to suck it up and make the time.
it's not the time. - Then what is it?
the anticontromere antibodies test.
the test that caused us to change the treatment from blastomycosis to scleroderma...
it wasn't-- wasn't what?
Dr. Cuddy?
they need you in the pediatric ICU. - Who's they?
I don't know. But I think they're lawyers.
if you guys screwed something up, just come clean.
it's not gonna be that bad.
with all due respect, you don't know what's at stake here.
what's going on? - You need to stop him!
he's about to ruin his life.
like you give a damn about my life.
Roy, he's right. You're borrowing money to buy options that are already out of the money.
even you won't be able to cover the losses.
your House, cars, bank accounts.
you'll lose everything. - That's the point.
the billionaire thinks that the gods will treat him better if he's broke.
I suggested he give it to me. - There's got to be some sort of balance.
you can't have all the good fortune in just one area of your life.
it's not how the world is supposed to look.
who said the world is supposed to work?
don't just wipe everything out. Put your assets in a trust.
give it to a charity. - I can't get anything back.
he's insane. - He's irrational.
so are most people.
unfortunately it doesn't make him insane.
if he signs that paper, he's not only gonna destroy his own life, but the lives of thousands of people who rely on this company to make a living.
if he is insane, we will sue this hospital
Mr. Randall... I know you're upset.
you shouldn't make a decision like this right now.
give it some time.
my son doesn't have any time.
your son's dying from an incurable disease, not bad karma.
no.
he's not dying.
it's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna let it.
Roy, please!
I'm sorry.
I can't let him die.
people don't get what they deserve. They just get what they get.
there's nothing any of us can do about it.
deliver it or I'll make sure you end up the ones with nothing.
for what?
for thinking I was worth breaking the law to keep around.
that's just the way I am, but still don't know what you're talking about.
Cuddy had I. T. Trace all the I. P.Addresses who' logged into my email account.
there were two.
mine and yours.
obviously House decided he needs you more than he's-- I already asked House.
and he'd certainly never lie.
no, he'd lie. Except he wants me gone.
and he do a lot better job of lying than you just did.
Really? It was that bad?
no, actually.
but it doesn't matter anymore.
Why? Because of House or Foreman?
you're good for both of them, but Foreman's not my best friend.
house will be fine.
maybe.
but with you on the team, he'd be better.
he needs someone... who doesn't need him.
you're the only one he's never really been able to suck into his crazy House vortex.
keeps him grounded. His ego in check.
why didn't you just come to me?
I figured you'd only stay if House asked and I knew he would eventually.
Bye, Wilson.
this is a great job.
maybe even better now that House is at least trying to have real relationships with people.
I said, "trying" .
it doesn't matter.
the job you love doesn't matter?
don't throw it all away just because of a bad break-up.
Bye, Wilson.
I just confessed.
I told thirteen I was the one who canceled the plane ticket.
Why? - You mean why did I confess or why did I do it?
I knew you didn't do it, so I guess the first.
you want her to stay because you want her back or because Foreman does?
why would I care what Foreman wants?
because you're not as big a jerk as everyone thinks.
Yes, I am. - No, you're not.
I just made a $10, 000 short sale on a stock I know is gonna crash because of what I saw a grief-stricken dad do on his son's deathbed.
no, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
you are a jerk.
she's making a mistake.
so you did it for her?
she's a good doctor. - So you did it for you?
I'm not the one in charge anymore.
so you did it for Foreman?
she's a smoking hot, newly single bisexual.
why don't you just admit that you like having her around?
she's good for you. You need her.
because I was born with a heart three sizes too small.
no, you weren't.- Yes, I...
what?
he still alive? - yeah.
good.
start him on heparin and iv immunoglobulin.
for degos?
the cardiac arrest wasn't just a "everything goes to hell in a handbasket" arrest.
it was a coronary event. Coronaries are large vessels.
mean's it can't be degos.
but the biopsies confirmed-- obstructed blood vessels.
but they can't be obstructed because of degos.
means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
you sure? - Nope.
but I will be if he responds to the heparin and the immunoglobulin.
by the way, someone screwed over your girlfriend and she ran to me, Cuddy, and Wilson.
everyone but you.
she's not over you.
or she is.
Where'd you find it?
find what?
the niacin boundchromium supplements.
it was right on top of the file, you don't know about it?
no. Been here all night.
one of Dibala's previous docs was prescribing ultra high doses of niacin boundchromium to boost his HDL.
so?
so it gives us something to point to.
we can explain the wide variation between the HDL numbers.
we're safe.
we're covered.
you really didn't request the info?
no.
and obviously you didn't either.
which means...
it worked.
the medicine worked.
it worked.
how'd you find it?
fat old black guy.
knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.
and what now?
I'm not the boss.
you don't think I should be fired?
Why? I doubt we'll ever be treating a genocidal dictator again.
better a murder than a miss. Agnosi whether you want to being charge or not... 
you are and you always will be.
75-year-old African man presented to our hospital following a rapid onset of hemoptysis.
he'd been fine prior to onset. No chest pain, fever, coughing, or chills...
I guess everybody else is dead... which means we're totally outnumbered.
we got to make up for that in pure firepower.
you want to raid the feeding area, don't you?
two boxes of grenades in there.
it's our only chance at getting out.
uh, vince, that place is a death trap.
lucky for you, I've got the mega-blaster.
Lee, you go right.
Roy, straight down the middle.
I'll cover you both.
1, 2,3!
Where's that cover fire?
Mega-blaster, dude.
Mega-blaster!
what the hell? Got it!
Vince, where are you?
Ah, I can't get them off of me!
Vince, you d-bag, where are you?
damn it. Damn it. Damn it, vince.
that blood look funny to you?
still working on it. The code's a little janky.
Hey, boss, you just like watching us ge our asses shredded?
Yeah, not that you're not hilarious, but we hit the shelves in three months.
Vince? Vince, what's wrong?
my hands. They're on fire.
your ncv test was normal.
rules out carpal tunnel.
no evidence of trauma.
your blood work looks normal.
then what is it? - Don't know.
I'll arrange to have you transferred to a neurologist.
a neurologist? Don't you have some famous diagnostics guy?
what's he doing?
I quit.
you can't quit.
I think you're confusing me with Jake Gyllenhaal.
house, are you okay?
Yeah, and I want to stay that way.
talked it over with my therapist. I need to change my environment, my habits.
but he cleared you to get your license back.
which will help immensely with my new job in research.
I've sent out some resumes. Research means no patients, less pressure.
well, you just got out. Have you had enough time to think this through?
I'm sorry.
I know this will affect both of you... and thirteen...
and the one with the nose.
I just can't risk coming back here.
okay.
that was surprising.
I want to run the department.
you consider waiting until House clears the lobby before you start angling for his job?
he's not dead or sentimental and somebody needs to do it.
not necessarily.
departments of diagnostic medicine don't exist.
the only reason we have one is because of house.
you reassigned us, kept us on payroll for three months.
you might as well give me a chance. - You're a great doctor.
I want you to stay on in neuro.
but house was a genius.
house was an egotistical, pill-popping lawsuit magnet... and a genius.
and I worked with him longer than anybody else.
I can do this.
you get one shot.
what's house gonna do?
no idea, but he's gone.
so how about we focus on the medicine?
what?
you're the boss. It's kind of sexy.
here I thought it was just the pants.
uh, diabetic neuropathy?
HbA1c looks fine.
could be hypothyroidism.
no fatigue or weight gain.
what about complex regional pain syndrome?
that's a good idea. - Let's run with it.
look at that. No House, the job still gets done.
and yet something's missing. - I'm short. He's black.
you're gay-ish.
th's it. - Treat for crps.
prep the patient for spinal stimulation.
I don't buy it. Crps isn't that well understood, but-- I think it's mercury poisoning.
I eat a ton of sushi.
and you're currently getting mixed reviews in speed-the-plow on broadway.
google it.
it's pretty hard to consume enough fish to give yourself mercury poisoning, and it doesn't usually present solely with pain.
but it can. Check out the Atlantic Medical Journal.
this guy came inwith burning pain caused by, uh,"erythromelalgia" caused by mercury poisoning.
who needs actual doctorswhen you got the internet?
no offense, but doctors make mistakes.
medical errorsare up 30% this year.
you should check the rateof patient error.
there's a tonof information out there.
why wouldn't I educate myself, be my own advocate?
Crps came upin my search too.
but I've never had any skin discoloration, and my pain is sporadic and not constant.
it's got to be worthone lousy blood test.
you know how house feels about people touching his ball.
no. Chase refuses to tell me.
right. My husband's gay. Witty.
I hear you're taking over for house.
you're gonna be great. Congratulations.
not permanent.
yet. Taub and thirteen cool with it?
he's older than you. She's seen you naked.
not like we haven't been working together for two years now.
working with is different than working for.
you saw House. How was he?
he was... good.
he was honest, took responsibility.
it was kind of weird.
uh, is thirteen around?
I need her to sign off on her E. R.Transfer.
she and taub are doing a spinal stimulation.
no, they're not.
I just dropped a patient in the cath suite, and your guys were not in there.
you know, usually spinal stimulation is done with the patient in the room.
he asked us to test his blood for mercury.
it's unlikely, but not impossible.
it's also not what we agreed on.
teing doesn't hurt. It only takes 20 minutes. I figured it didn't matter.
I'm thinking I should decide when it matters.
when you're done marking your territory... test results.
surprise, surprise.
Marcus Webly was wrong.
I'll handle this.
you expected not to have mixed feelings?
I know it's the right call.
just don't know what to do with my time.
and my leg-- pain's flared up since I left Mayfield.
Ibuprofen's barely putting a dent in it.
you need a hobby.
right. Doctors the world over treat chronic pain with collections of hummel figurines.
no, I didn't say you need a lame hobby.
you need something to keep you engaged, connected to other people.
you already made me get a roommate.
Wilson's got one bedroom.
I don't think we can get any more connected without unzipping.
okay. So what does Wilson like to do?
Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman, head of diagnostics.
so you must be the genius' replacement.
I prefer to think of myself as genius 2. 0.
your blood tests ruled out mercury poisoning.
what was my mercury level?- 2. 8. That means for every deciliter of
I know what it means. I also know it's above normal.
I want mercury chelation.
your level isn't elevated enough to produce your symptoms.
you can't know that until we de-elevate it and see if my pain improves.
it's a judgment call.
based on ten years of medical training?
I think you have crps. I want to tryspinal stimulation.
so, basically, you want to shove a needle in my spine based on a glorified hunch.
I'll stickwith the chelation.
if you don't want to get better, I think we're done.
what do you mean ""?
you're not interested in my medical opinion.
I'll move on to my next patient.
you'll move on to a doctor willing to run all the unnecessary tests and procedures you want.
or you can stick around and be cured.
makes no difference to me.
I'm glad you changed your mind.
don't know about that.
Dr. Foreman basically strong-armed me, which is impressive.
stimulating at 100 htz.
guess you found him a little more persuasive than two of us-- probably the pants.
he reminds me of me.
is it supposed to hurt?
not if we're in correctly.
is it your hands? Your back?
no, my chest. Can't breathe.
heart rate's 140, climbing.
you need to hold still.
what did you do?
deep breaths.
his lungsare filling with fluid.
analysis of the fluid from vince's lungs shows the lung problem is really a heart problem.
he's got a thickened left ventricle.
when his heart sped upduring the procedure, it jacked up the pressure in his lungs, causing pulmonary edema.
good thing I talked the patient into spinal stimulation.
it did lead us to discovering a new symptom and proved he was wrong about mercury poisoning.
we lucked into that discovery, and we were wrong about crps.
ventricular thickening plus neuropathy could equal lyme disease.
not without joint pain.
when is his new game coming out?
couple months. - He's probably working nonstop.
might be using more than coffee to power through.
cocaine use explains the symptoms.
so we search his office for drugs.
no.
we're gonna ask him.
in a lot of ways, cooking is like music.
different elements combine to make a symphony.
difference is that beethoven's 5th isn't gonna be poop tomorrow.
what was my one condition for allowing you to tag along?
try not to be a jerk.
I'm trying.
I'm just failing.
roll your meat balls and keep an open mind.
how hard are you trying not to make a ball joke right now?
they're smoking.
your balls.
no, no.
they're browning way too fast.
blue is the color you got to watch out for.
enough.
my god, they're--they're still raw inside.
by the time they're cooked through, the outside will be burned.
I think there's a medicated powder for that.
although vinegar could work.
my o-chem prof talked about how, theoretically, you shouldn't trust the results of a hemoglobin a1c test on a chronically acidoticpatient.
the acid in the bloods lows the reaction between the hemoglobin protein and blood sugar.
browning meat is the same chemical process, which means, it should also be slowed by acid.
that actually makes sense.
you might've...saved my balls.
that's the spirit.
obviously, the procedure didn't go as planned.
the heart problem was unforeseeable, but I still feel responsible. I'm sorry.
okay. How long you guys been doing it?
I think it's best if we kept things professional.
tough to do now that I've seen you rock a leopard-print bikini.
congrats, by the way. Up top.
you hacked my profile page?
your treatment nearly gave me a heart attack.
figured I'd check if you had the credentials to go with the cojones.
one search led to another. Is there a shot of just her?
I'm thinking screen saver.
we need to know if you've been using cocaine.
Nope. Dude, you just block everybody, or do you really only have three friends?
we need you to be straight with us.
we need to be able to trust you.
I cleaned up my act 12 years ago... after mycollege roommate O. D.'D.
okay.
search his office. - You think he was lying?
no. But I'm not sure.
it was worth asking. If he'd have said yes, it would've saved us a trip.
but he didn't.
you have to forget about him.
the patient? - House.
first, you try acting like him.
that doesn't work. So then you try the opposite.
now you're mad because you have to use his move.
I feel like tom brady's backup.
Tom Brady's backup now makes $10 million.
stop comparing.
you can do this by being you.
we should still check out his office, talk to his coworkers.
I'll get Taub.
and... thanks.
Oh, and dinner tonight at 7: 00. - Can we make it 8: 00?
already made a reservation for 7: 00.
I'm making gnocchi.
Oh, I didn't mean to intrude. I just-- Cecile's in my cooking class.
she doesn't speak english.
if you bake the potatoes instead of boiling them, it's less moisture, fewer gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.
you seem good.
feeling better.
house, I need to talk to youabout your leaving the hospital.
I do love a good groveling, but my decision is final.
that's fine as long as I'm not the reason for it.
I know that sounds completely narcissistic, but-- yeah.
but it's not.
we flirted. We kissed.
I fondled.
I hallucinated a night with you and yelled it from a hospital balcony.
you're not a narcissist.
so what am I?
not the reason I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you.
lady, either kiss him or leave.
we got work to do.
you just couldn't keep your trap shut.
make the damn gnocchi. - Bye.
I guess you're not in a hurry to get back to the office.
and you are?
I'm not trying to avoid my boyfriend.
I'm a lizard. Not an idiot.
you've been in a crappy mood since we got in the car.
and you're cpletely okay with being ordered around by someone who 24 hours ago was basically your equal?
unlike you, I didn't expect anything different.
the work part, I can get used to.
he didn't ask me to go to dinner.
he told me we were going.
he's never done that before.
so even the score.
go home tonight, put on some heels, and break him like a pony. You'll feel much better.
what?
wow, that's one big-ass bird.
it's kind of amazing. The way the wings move, it's so real.
get them off me!
I know what's wrong with the patient.
I'm going to call foreman.
little help.
your partner said you studied birds to improve the game animation. Did you touch them?
can't dissect without touching.
it's the best way to understand the anatomy.
it's also a good way to contract an infection called psittacosis.
we spoke to Dr. Foreman. He wants to start you on antibiotics.
does that infection cause problems in the... joystick area?
I'm kind of stuck in play mode.
Yes, we get it.
she's very, very pretty.
it's not her. I mean, it was... when she was here with her boyfriend three hours ago.
you've had an erection for three hours?
at first, it was just embarrassing, but now it's really starting to hurt.
will the antibiotics help?
I'm afraid not. This isn't psittacosis.
his erection persisted even with medication.
we had to put in a surgical shunt just to drain the blood.
you missed dinner. And a shunt doesn't require both of you.
I'm dedicated.
so the holy trinity: Heart, hands, hose.
could be guillain-barre.
not with normal nerve conduction.
thrombocytosis.
his platelet count isn't that high.
brain tumor makes more sense.
I'm sorry. I just realized... joint pain and joint pain.
honest, I wasn't laughing because of the obvious tension between the two of you.
erection points to a circulatory problem. I'm with foreman.
it is possible for a brain tumor to cause-- we're goingwith thrombocytosis.
okay.
you're mad I didn't ask you to dinner?
how long have we been dating?
it felt like an order. Your tone of voice was--my tone?
I'm under a little pressure right now. How about giving mea break?
look, this is tough for both of us, except I haven't just gotten a promotion.
so now you're jealous.
no. I'm just saying don't complain about the burdens of command to your employees.
I was complaining to my girlfriend.
who are those guys?
I have no idea.
meet the competition.
steve Paulson. Neurology, St. Mark'S. Nice to meet you.
you called another doctor?
lots of other doctors. Posted my symptoms on the internet.
you guys are 0 for 2. I thought I'd look for some backup.
I can cure all your symptoms with my papaya toxin cleanse.
month's supply,$395.
okay, that guy's an idiot. That doesn't mean they all are.
neither one of you have privileges at this hospital.
please leave... now.
uh, Dr. Foreman, sorry for the intrusion, but, um, I noticed you haven't done a head mri yet.
cause he doesn't need one. - I'm pretty sure he's got a brain tumor.
we considered that and concluded thrombocytosis is more likely.
I'm starting him on hydroxyurea.
his platelets don't seem anywhere near high enough.
if you took an image, I'm sure you'll-- there are no signs of increased icp.
I'm not delaying treatment. - Looks like we need a tiebreaker.
Dr. Hadley, what do you think?
I think both theories have merit.
so brain tumor, otherwise you'd back your boss/boyfriend.
I want an mri.
fine. I'll set it up.
great. You're up.
I need a taster.
ragout with pork sausage, beef thigh, no cream.
it's a little early.
did you even go to bed last night?
bed is for sissies, unless you're having sex, in which case... no, bed is still for sissies.
doesn't this seem a little bit obsessive?
should've been here when I was butchering the ox.
what do you expectan I'm addict. I turn everything up to eleven.
Yeah. I thought you were trying to tone that down.
no. I was trying to find something I could set at eleven without blowing out my eardrums.
star anisewith caramelized onions.
the sulfur compounds bring out the meat flavor.
I couldn't sleep because of my leg.
it was either make rag out or go out on the street looking to score.
good choice.
so, so good.
he asked me a question. I answered.
you told meto make my own decisions. I do, and you stab me in the back.
I didn't even say what I really thought.
I hedged, and I don't like that I hedged.
if I have a legitimate opinion-- express it in private.
in public, the team opinion is your opinion.
except the team opinion is your opinion.
that's my job. - And what's mine, to lie when I'm asked a direct question?
you would've done it for House.
maybe you just don't want me to succeed.
maybe you just want to kick me again for not asking you to dinner.
at least when House was being an unbelievable jerk, I could talk to my boyfriend about it.
I may be a jerk, but you're wrong mri is clean.
treat for thrombocytosis.
you're early.
for what?
I knew you'd show up here complaining about foreman.
thought you'd hold out for another week at least.
I showed up to askif you've seen thrombocytosis with a platelet count under
I went crazy, not stupid.
I leave, foreman embraces his inner mugabe.
what's that?
Embryonali-- unhatched chicken egg.
I'm gonna suck out some of the yolk and replace it with ragout.
by the way, you can tell the other lepers that their absence has been noted.
cameron didn't come by?
daddy's little co-dependent is all grown up.
making room for daddy's hot bisexual with boyfriend problems.
it's not a problem. It's, um...
okay. It's a problem.
I mean, I get it. The patient's a nightmare.
he posted his case online. It--you know Foreman.
you know the situation.
how can I get him to tone it down?
stop being a coward for one thing.
he's the one who's afraid of failure.
at a job that no one before me has ever done.
his fears are justified.
you're just afraid of giving him control over you, which might work at home.
it makes it almost impossible for him to do his job.
pass me those crackers.
you're saying this is all my fault?
I'm saying... that you would be happier if you learned when it's okay to give in.
what?
you just suggested that I give in so that I can be happy.
what did they do to you in there?
taste this.
good.
this might be the best thing I've ever eaten.
and, yes, I'm including what you're thinking of now.
you are an amazing cook!
I know.
and yet, my leg hurts.
fire her. - I'm not gonna fire her.
then stop being such a wuss. - I'm not being a wuss.
challenging you is part of her job.
but when she does it, you take it personally.
so you're saying this is my fault?
I was trying to bury it a little, but, yeah.
you got to eliminate either the challenge or the reaction.
or we could stick with my original plan.
we get drunk and talk about how girls are lame.
Yeah.
this problem will go away on its own.
it's 8: 00 in the morning.
coffee ice cream.
no frittata?
no bombolini?
started thinking about what you said, about me obsessing.
started obsessing about obsessing.
decided to take a day off.
you were enjoying cooking.
how like a man to think that I enjoy slaving over a hot stove all day while you're off banging secretaries.
you said it was keeping your mind off the pain.
that was before I discovered the biggest loser marathon on cable.
I like to pretend they can see me eating.
and your leg?
it's fine.
my leg's killing me.
Cookg helped for a while. I guess I got bored.
my leg started hurting again. Then I got worried, and that made the pain worse.
what are you worried about?
that nothing's gonna help.
that I end up in the very dark place.
I'm fine... just not happy.
I didn't let you out because you were happy.
I let you out, because I believe you had the skills to cope with that.
you tried one thing. It didn't work. So move on.
write. Play chess.
what if nothing works?
what if nothing gives me more than a few days before my brain starts lookingfothe next fix, before my leg feels like someone's shoving nails into it?
what do I do then?
if nothing in the world can hold your interest, uh, we'll deal with that when we get to it.
but you have to trust me, and you have to be patient.
I brought you a doughnut.
the florist was closed.
I'll get a vaseand put it in water.
you knowI'm sorry, right?
I'm sorry too.
do you think, um... we could start over?
that's a fantastic idea.
we're gonna be late.
your boss won't mind.
no way.
his lymph nodes blew up.
he's been treated for thrombocytosis, but there's been no change.
I was wrong. - God, you are a genius.
I'm adding this to my list of symptoms.
that didn't work last time. - Because I didn't think big enough.
now I'm offering a $25, 000 reward.
steroids reduced his facial swelling.
swollen lymph nodesrule out thrombocytosis.
how did so many people get my personal email?
the internet is a magical place.
lymph enlargement makes me think polyarteritis-- you were saying?
no point in treating the symptom and not the disease.
your stunt generated quite a few responses. Let's take a look.
I'm way ahead of you. - Paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to spinal tumor.
no. No hypercalcemia. No muscle spasms or incontinence.
you are possessed by the biblical demon "legion.
no, no jumping off cliff in a herd of pigs.
otherwise it did fit.
graves' disease. - No. Thyroid levels are normal.
you want us to spend the next few days shooting down every theory in the world, or can we do our jobs and come up with one that works?
I want you to test me for amyloidosis.
that your professional opinion?
it's the wisdom of crowds.
studies show the collective decision of a group can be more accurate than any individual's decision.
I went through my emails. Amyloidosis got the most votes.
if you had amyloidosis, there'd be speckling on your cardiac ultrasound.
in 100% of cases?
fine. I'll make you a deal. We'll do a kidney biopsy to test for amyloidosis.
when it comes back negative, you pull your case off of the internet and retract the reward.
it's either that, or I don't test you at all.
deal.
if you wanted a quickie, you should've called ahead.
I'm a mess.
came home for lunch.
you have lunch with cuddy on tuesdays.
she was busy.
and you are checking upon me.
you know, you can talk to me.
is that my laundry?
you were running out of socks for me to borrow.
you got plenty of underwear, though.
I'm fine.
you said that this morning. - And consist encyproves what?
really. I'm good.
I'll put these in your room.
biopsy showed deposits in the renal endothelium consistent with amyloidosis.
the internet was right.
start him on dexamethasone.
already done.
this may not be the best time for this... but I quit.
I got an offer to joina friend's surgical practice.
um, you don't generally get an offer unless you're looking for one.
I put out some feelers when I found out house wasn't coming back.
I lobbied to keep the department open so you could keep your job.
Yes. That was incrediblyal truistic of you.
it's nothing personal.
actually, I think you're doing pretty well.
but I came here to work with house.
he's a jerk.
we'll be fine without him.
do you know how many resumes we get every day without even asking?
might be a few less after cuddy shuts us down.
the case got solved under your watch.
does it really matter how it happened?
it matters.
what if I'm just not ready for this job?
okay, you're sad.
I could tell you the story about me and my roommate at Sarah Lawrence.
okay.
her name was Lindsey, and she was a cheerleader from Iowa.
I broke my toilet this morning.
I'll get my tools.
I blocked the intake valve so I could collect some of House's urine.
Cuddy, he was barely limping.
what did the lab say?
the urine was clean for vicodin.
it did, however, contain strange epithelial cells.
further analysis showed they were from a labrador retriever.
damn. He's using.
no. No.
Vince. Vince. Vince, relax. It's Dr. Foreman.
kill it! Kill it!
No! No! I don't have my blaster!
he's hallucinating'cause he's burning up. Amyloidosis wouldn't do this.
amyloidosis wouldn't do this.
the antipyretics didn't work. Hopefully the cold tubwill get his temp down.
maybe we should see if anyone's sent in other ideas.
maybe the reward money attract-- no.
I'm not letting anyone else jerk us around. The masses were wrong about amyloidosis.
they don't know about the fever.
I'm going with light-chain deposition disorder.
you okay with that?
Yes.
we think you have a disease called lcdd.
it causes protein to build up in your organs.
you think?
we can't definitely confirm the diagnosis.
and our only chance of beating this would be to start you on high-dose chemotherapy.
but I do have to warn you thatn your condition, it might kill you.
do you want me to get you some more information?
you're my doctor. I trust you.
no, you don't. a
you're scared, and you don't want to make this decision.
my career is riding on this case... nowhere near as important as your life.
but I think the best shot for both of us is to treat for lcdd.
okay.
all right, let's get you out of this tub and into chemo.
we know you're back on vicodin.
no. The only thing you know is that I'm a genius who got a dog to pee in your toilet.
you don't know how I did itor, more interestingly, where I peed.
house, you've spent the last three months-- et tu, butte?
you got no reason toe here. He's the oneI was jerking around.
why is your leg better?
it hurts. Please go away now.
if you really think I'm using, how about asking me before taking a wrench to your plumbing?
house, you're an addict. You can't be surprised if we can't take you at your word.
fine. Let's get you some proof.
hide your eyes, ladies.
you too.
my godson made me that mug.
if the lab says that this is retriever too, please let me know right away.
it'd explainmy overwhelming desire to wipe my button your carpet.
thank you for dragging meinto this.
stop the chemo.
he's got fabry's disease.
he was in the tub for an hour. His fingers should have pruned, but they didn't.
already stopped chemoand confirmed Fabry's.
I'm glad you both agree, but could somebody loop me in here?
we assumed the deposits in your kidneys were proteins, but they were fats.
Fabry's makes them build up in your organs, choke your nerves, keep your fingers from pruning in water.
it's chronic but manageable.
how'd you figure it out?
iodine mumps.
his lymph nodes swelled up after the head C. T.
we thought it was a new symptom, but it wasn't.
it was a reaction to the contrast.
iodine mumps takes lymph nodes off the table. Remove that symptom...
and that just came to you?
I looked through the online responses again.
someone posted it this morning.
heard cuddy made it official.
department's yours. Congrats.
I'm sorry.
I went behind your back.
on a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you?
a 7.
and that's stupid. You did the right thing.
it's my fault you thought you had to go behind my back.
I should've stood up to you.
but you didn't 'cause you didn't want to fight again.
it's our first case. It'll take time to adjust.
what if by the time we get adjusted, we don't like each other anymore?
that's not gonna happen.
you sure?'Cause ever since I took this job, we've been making each other miserable.
I really don't think this is gonna work.
you're breaking upwith me?
no. The other night when I thought I was done, you were there.
I need you.
I don't wantto lose you.
why are you...?
you're firing me.
I'm sorry.
I slipped.
you took vicodin?
25000
I solved my old team's case.
I was about to take the pills. I was visiting online.
I found people posting medical problems, and... my leg stopped hurting.
I'm supposed to be changing my life.
this is not a change.
well, maybe I was wrong.
says the guy making sand castles in my brain.
we need to keep you from using.
taking your job away, the medical puzzles, nearly drove you back to it.
maybe diagnostic medicine is the key to keeping you clean.
so you're okay with me going online, solving cases?
no.
you can't sit all day in a room by yourself.
isolation fosters depression.
the hospital is partof my old life.
if I go back, I might become... who I was before, pills and all.
that's a possibility.
but could be... the only thing worse for you than going back to diagnostic medicine is not going back.
guess we're gonna find out.
I guess everybody else is dead... which means we're totally outnumbered.
we got to make up for that in pure firepower.
you want to raid the feeding area, don't you?
two boxes of grenades in there.
it's our only chance at getting out.
uh, Vince, that place is a death trap.
lucky for you, I've got the mega-blaster.
Lee, you go right.
Roy, straight down the middle.
I'll cover you both.
1, 2,3!
Where's that cover fire?
Mega-blaster, dude.
Mega-blaster!
what the hell? Got it!
Vince, where are you?
Ah, I can't get them off of me!
Vince, you d-bag, where are you?
damn it. Damn it. Damn it, vince.
that blood look funny to you?
still working on it. The code's a little janky.
Hey, boss, you just like watching us ge our asses shredded?
Yeah, not that you're not hilarious, but we hit the shelves in three months.
Vince? Vince, what's wrong?
my hands. They're on fire.
your ncv test was normal.
rules out carpal tunnel.
no evidence of trauma.
your blood work looks normal.
then what is it? - Don't know.
I'll arrange to have you transferred to a neurologist.
a neurologist? Don't you have some famous diagnostics guy?
what's he doing?
I quit.
you can't quit.
I think you're confusing me with jake gyllenhaal.
house, are you okay?
Yeah, and I want to stay that way.
talked it over with my therapist. I need to change my environment, my habits.
but he cleared you to get your license back.
which will help immensely with my new job in research.
I've sent out some resumes. Research means no patients, less pressure.
well, you just got out. Have you had enough time to think this through?
I'm sorry.
I know this will affect both of you... and thirteen...
and the one with the nose.
I just can't risk coming back here.
okay.
that was surprising.
I want to run the department.
you consider waiting until house clears the lobby before you start angling for his job?
he's not dead or sentimental and somebody needs to do it.
not necessarily.
departments of diagnostic medicine don't exist.
the only reason we have one is because of house.
you reassigned us, kept us on payroll for three months.
you might as well give me a chance. - You're a great doctor.
I want you to stay on in neuro.
but house was a genius.
house was an egotistical, pill-popping lawsuit magnet... and a genius.
and I worked with him longer than anybody else.
I can do this.
you get one shot.
what's house gonna do?
no idea, but he's gone.
so how about we focus on the medicine?
what?
you're the boss. It's kind of sexy.
here I thought it was just the pants.
uh, diabetic neuropathy?
HbA1c looks fine.
could be hypothyroidism.
no fatigue or weight gain.
what about complex regional pain syndrome?
that's a good idea. - Let's run with it.
look at that. No house, the job still gets done.
and yet something's missing. - I'm short. He's black.
you're gay-ish.
th's it. - Treat for crps.
prep the patient for spinal stimulation.
I don't buy it. Crps isn't that well understood, but-- I think it's mercury poisoning.
I eat a ton of sushi.
and you're currently getting mixed reviews in speed-the-plow on broadway.
google it.
it's pretty hard to consume enough fish to give yourself mercury poisoning, and it doesn't usually present solely with pain.
but it can. Check out the atlantic medical journal.
this guy came inwith burning pain caused by, uh,"erythromelalgia" caused by mercury poisoning.
who needs actual doctorswhen you got the internet?
no offense, but doctors make mistakes.
medical errorsare up 30% this year.
you should check the rateof patient error.
there's a tonof information out there.
why wouldn't I educate myself, be my own advocate?
Crps came upin my search too.
but I've never had any skin discoloration, and my pain is sporadic and not constant.
it's got to be worthone lousy blood test.
you know how house feels about people touching his ball.
no. Chase refuses to tell me.
right. My husband's gay. Witty.
I hear you're taking over for house.
you're gonna be great. Congratulations.
not permanent.
yet. Taub and thirteen cool with it?
he's older than you. She's seen you naked.
not like we haven't been working together for two years now.
working with is different than working for.
you saw house. How was he?
he was... good.
he was honest, took responsibility.
it was kind of weird.
uh, is thirteen around?
I need her to sign off on her E. R.Transfer.
she and taub are doing a spinal stimulation.
no, they're not.
I just dropped a patient in the cath suite, and your guys were not in there.
you know, usually spinal stimulation is done with the patient in the room.
he asked us to test his blood for mercury.
it's unlikely, but not impossible.
it's also not what we agreed on.
teing doesn't hurt. It only takes 20 minutes. I figured it didn't matter.
I'm thinking I should decide when it matters.
when you're done marking your territory... test results.
surprise, surprise.
Marcus webly was wrong.
I'll handle this.
you expected not to have mixed feelings?
I know it's the right call.
just don't know what to do with my time.
and my leg-- pain's flared up since I left mayfield.
Ibuprofen's barely putting a dent in it.
you need a hobby.
right. Doctors the world over treat chronic pain with collections of hummel figurines.
no, I didn't say you need a lame hobby.
you need something to keep you engaged, connected to other people.
you already made me get a roommate.
Wilson's got one bedroom.
I don't think we can get any more connected without unzipping.
okay. So what does wilson like to do?
Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman, head of diagnostics.
so you must be the genius' replacement.
I prefer to think of myself as genius 2. 0.
your blood tests ruled out mercury poisoning.
what was my mercury level?- 2. 8. That means for every deciliter of
I know what it means. I also know it's above normal.
I want mercury chelation.
your level isn't elevated enough to produce your symptoms.
you can't know that until we de-elevate it and see if my pain improves.
it's a judgment call.
based on ten years of medical training?
I think you have crps. I want to tryspinal stimulation.
so, basically, you want to shove a needle in my spine based on a glorified hunch.
I'll stickwith the chelation.
if you don't want to get better, I think we're done.
what do you mean ""?
you're not interested in my medical opinion.
I'll move on to my next patient.
you'll move on to a doctor willing to run all the unnecessary tests and procedures you want.
or you can stick around and be cured.
makes no difference to me.
I'm glad you changed your mind.
don't know about that.
Dr. Foreman basically strong-armed me, which is impressive.
stimulating at 100 htz.
guess you found him a little more persuasive than two of us-- probably the pants.
he reminds me of me.
is it supposed to hurt?
not if we're in correctly.
is it your hands? Your back?
no, my chest. Can't breathe.
heart rate's 140, climbing.
you need to hold still.
what did you do?
deep breaths.
his lungsare filling with fluid.
analysis of the fluid from vince's lungs shows the lung problem is really a heart problem.
he's got a thickened left ventricle.
when his heart sped upduring the procedure, it jacked up the pressure in his lungs, causing pulmonary edema.
good thing I talked the patient into spinal stimulation.
it did lead us to discovering a new symptom and proved he was wrong about mercury poisoning.
we lucked into that discovery, and we were wrong about crps.
ventricular thickening plus neuropathy could equal lyme disease.
not without joint pain.
when is his new game coming out?
couple months. - He's probably working nonstop.
might be using more than coffee to power through.
cocaine use explains the symptoms.
so we search his office for drugs.
no.
we're gonna ask him.
in a lot of ways, cooking is like music.
different elements combine to make a symphony.
difference is that beethoven's 5th isn't gonna be poop tomorrow.
what was my one condition for allowing you to tag along?
try not to be a jerk.
I'm trying.
I'm just failing.
roll your meat balls and keep an open mind.
how hard are you trying not to make a ball joke right now?
they're smoking.
your balls.
no, no.
they're browning way too fast.
blue is the color you got to watch out for.
enough.
my god, they're--they're still raw inside.
by the time they're cooked through, the outside will be burned.
I think there's a medicated powder for that.
although vinegar could work.
my o-chem prof talked about how, theoretically, you shouldn't trust the results of a hemoglobin a1c test on a chronically acidoticpatient.
the acid in the bloods lows the reaction between the hemoglobin protein and blood sugar.
browning meat is the same chemical process, which means, it should also be slowed by acid.
that actually makes sense.
you might've...saved my balls.
that's the spirit.
obviously, the procedure didn't go as planned.
the heart problem was unforeseeable, t I still feel responsible. I'm sorry.
okay. How long you guys been doing it?
I thk it's best if we kept things professional.
tough to do now that I've seen you rock a leopard-print bikini.
congrats, by the way. Up top.
you hacked my profile page?
your treatment nearly gave me a heart attack.
figured I'd check if you had the credentials to go with the cojones.
one search led to another. Is there a shot of just her?
I'm thinking screen saver.
we need to know if you've been using cocaine.
Nope. Dude, you just block everybody, or do you really only have three friends?
we need you to be straight with us.
we need to be able to trust you.
I cleaned up my act 12 years ago... after mycollege roommate O. D.'D.
okay.
search his office. - You think he was lying?
no. But I'm not sure.
it was worth asking. If he'd have said yes, it would've saved us a trip.
but he didn't.
you have to forget about him.
the patient? - House.
first, you try acting like him.
that doesn't work. So then you try the opposite.
now you're mad because you have to use his move.
I feel like tom brady's backup.
Tom brady's backup now makes $10 million.
stop comparing.
you can do this by being you.
we should still check out his office, talk to his coworkers.
I'll get taub.
and... thanks.
Oh, and dinner tonight at 7: 00. - Can we make it 8: 00?
already made a reservation for 7: 00.
I'm making gnocchi.
Oh, I didn't mean to intrude. I just-- cecile's in my cooking class.
she doesn't speak english.
if you bake the potatoes instead of boiling them, it's less moisture, fewer gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.
you seem good.
feeling better.
house, I need to talk to youabout your leaving the hospital.
I do love a good groveling, but my decision is final.
that's fine as long as I'm not the reason for it.
I know that sounds completely narcissistic, but-- yeah.
but it's not.
we flirted. We kissed.
I fondled.
I hallucinated a night with you and yelled it from a hospital balcony.
you're not a narcissist.
so what am I?
not the reason I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you.
lady, either kiss him or leave.
we got work to do.
you just couldn't keep your trap shut.
make the damn gnocchi. - Bye.
I guess you're not in a hurry to get back to the office.
and you are?
I'm not trying to avoid my boyfriend.
I'm a lizard. Not an idiot.
you've been in a crappy mood since we got in the car.
and you're cpletely okay with being ordered around by someone who 24 hours ago was basically your equal?
unlike you, I didn't expect anything different.
the work part, I can get used to.
he didn't ask me to go to dinner.
he told me we were going.
he's never done that before.
so even the score.
go home tonight, put on some heels, and break him like a pony. You'll feel much better.
what?
wow, that's one big-ass bird.
it's kind of amazing. The way the wings move, it's so real.
get them off me!
I know what's wrong with the patient.
I'm going to call foreman.
little help.
your partner said you studied birds to improve the game animation. Did you touch them?
can't dissect without touching.
it's the best way to understand the anatomy.
it's also a good way to contract an infection called psittacosis.
we spoke to Dr. Foreman. He wants to start you on antibiotics.
does that infection cause problems in the... joystick area?
I'm kind of stuck in play mode.
Yes, we get it.
she's very, very pretty.
it's not her. I mean, it was... when she was here with her boyfriend three hours ago.
you've had an erection for three hours?
at first, it was just embarrassing, but now it's really starting to hurt.
will the antibiotics help?
I'm afraid not. This isn't psittacosis.
his erection persisted even with medication.
we had to put in a surgical shunt just to drain the blood.
you missed dinner. And a shunt doesn't requireboth of you.
I'm dedicated.
so the holy trinity: Heart, hands, hose.
could be guillain-barre.
not with normal nerve conduction.
thrombocytosis.
his platelet count isn't that high.
brain tumor makes more sense.
I'm sorry. I just realized... joint pain and joint pain.
honest, I wasn't laughing because of the obvious tension between the two of you.
erection points to a circulatory problem. I'm with foreman.
it is possible for a brain tumor to cause-- we're goingwith thrombocytosis.
okay.
you're mad I didn't ask you to dinner?
how long have we been dating?
it felt like an order. Your tone of voice was--my tone?
I'm under a little pressure right now. How about giving mea break?
look, this is tough for both of us, except I haven't just gotten a promotion.
so now you're jealous.
no. I'm just saying don't complain about the burdens of command to your employees.
I was complaining to my girlfriend.
who are those guys?
I have no idea.
meet the competition.
steve paulson. Neurology, st. Mark'S. Nice to meet you.
you called another doctor?
lots of other doctors. Posted my symptoms on the internet.
you guys are 0 for 2. I thought I'd look for some backup.
I can cure all your symptoms with my papaya toxin cleanse.
month's supply,$395.
okay, that guy's an idiot. That doesn't mean they all are.
neither one of you have privileges at this hospital.
please leave... now.
uh, Dr. Foreman, sorry for the intrusion, but, um, I noticed you haven't done a head mri yet.
cause he doesn't need one. - I'm pretty sure he's got a brain tumor.
we considered that and concluded thrombocytosis is more likely.
I'm starting him on hydroxyurea.
his platelets don't seem anywhere near high enough.
if you took an image, I'm sure you'll-- there are no signs of increased icp.
I'm not delaying treatment. - Looks like we need a tiebreaker.
Dr. Hadley, what do you think?
I think both theories have merit.
so brain tumor, otherwise you'd back your boss/boyfriend.
I want an mri.
fine. I'll set it up.
great. You're up.
I need a taster.
ragout with pork sausage, beef thigh, no cream.
it's a little early.
did you even go to bed last night?
bed is for sissies, unless you're having sex, in which case... no, bed is still for sissies.
doesn't this seem a little bit obsessive?
should've been here when I was butchering the ox.
what do you expectan I'm addict. I turn everything up to eleven.
Yeah. I thought you were trying to tone that down.
no. I was trying to find something I could set at eleven without blowing out my eardrums.
star anisewith caramelized onions.
the sulfur compounds bring out the meat flavor.
I couldn't sleep because of my leg.
it was either make rag out or go out on the street looking to score.
good choice.
so, so good.
he asked me a question. I answered.
you told meto make my own decisions. I do, and you stab me in the back.
I didn't even say what I really thought.
I hedged, and I don't like that I hedged.
if I have a legitimate opinion-- express it in private.
in public, the team opinion is your opinion.
except the team opinion is your opinion.
that's my job. - And what's mine, to lie when I'm asked a direct question?
you would've done it for house.
maybe you just don't want me to succeed.
maybe you just want to kick me again for not asking you to dinner.
at least when house was being an unbelievable jerk, I could talk to my boyfriend about it.
I may be a jerk, but you're wrong mri is clean.
treat for thrombocytosis.
you're early.
for what?
I knew you'd show up here complaining about foreman.
thought you'd hold out for another week at least.
I showed up to askif you've seen thrombocytosis with a platelet count under
I went crazy, not stupid.
I leave, foreman embraces his inner mugabe.
what's that?
Embryonali-- unhatched chicken egg.
I'm gonna suck out some of the yolk and replace it with ragout.
by the way, you can tell the other lepers that their absence has been noted.
cameron didn't come by?
daddy's little co-dependent is all grown up.
making room for daddy's hot bisexual with boyfriend problems.
it's not a problem. It's, um...
okay. It's a problem.
I mean, I get it. The patient's a nightmare.
he posted his case online. It--you know foreman.
you know the situation.
how can I get him to tone it down?
stop being a coward for one thing.
he's the one who's afraid of failure.
at a job that no one before me has ever done.
his fears are justified.
you're just afraid of giving him control over you, which might work at home.
it makes it almost impossible for him to do his job.
pass me those crackers.
you're saying this is all my fault?
I'm saying... that you would be happier if you learned when it's okay to give in.
what?
you just suggested that I give in so that I can be happy.
what did they do to you in there?
taste this.
good.
this might be the best thing I've ever eaten.
and, yes, I'm including what you're thinking of now.
you are an amazing cook!
I know.
and yet, my leg hurts.
fire her. - I'm not gonna fire her.
then stop being such a wuss. - I'm not being a wuss.
challenging you is part of her job.
but when she does it, you take it personally.
so you're saying this is my fault?
I was trying to bury it a little, but, yeah.
you got to eliminate either the challenge or the reaction.
or we could stick with my original plan.
we get drunk and talk about how girls are lame.
Yeah.
this problem will go away on its own.
it's 8: 00 in the morning.
coffee ice cream.
no frittata?
no bombolini?
started thinking about what you said, about me obsessing.
started obsessing about obsessing.
decided to take a day off.
you were enjoying cooking.
how like a man to think that I enjoy slaving over a hot stove all day while you're off banging secretaries.
you said it was keeping your mind off the pain.
that was before I discovered the biggest loser marathon on cable.
I like to pretend they can see me eating.
and your leg?
it's fine.
my leg's killing me.
Cookg helped for a while. I guess I got bored.
my leg started hurting again. Then I got worried, and that made the pain worse.
what are you worried about?
that nothing's gonna help.
that I end up in the very dark place.
I'm fine... just not happy.
I didn't let you out because you were happy.
I let you out, because I believe you had the skills to cope with that.
you tried one thing. It didn't work. So move on.
write. Play chess.
what if nothing works?
what if nothing gives me more than a few days before my brain starts lookingfothe next fix, before my leg feels like someone's shoving nails into it?
what do I do then?
if nothing in the world can hold your interest, uh, we'll deal with that when we get to it.
but you have to trust me, and you have to be patient.
I brought you a doughnut.
the florist was closed.
I'll get a vaseand put it in water.
you knowI'm sorry, right?
I'm sorry too.
do you think, um... we could start over?
that's a fantastic idea.
we're gonna be late.
your boss won't mind.
no way.
his lymph nodes blew up.
he's been treated for thrombocytosis, but there's been no change.
I was wrong. - God, you are a genius.
I'm adding this to my list of symptoms.
that didn't work last time. - Because I didn't think big enough.
now I'm offering a $25, 000 reward.
steroids reduced his facial swelling.
swollen lymph nodesrule out thrombocytosis.
how did so many people get my personal email?
the internet is a magical place.
lymph enlargement makes me think polyarteritis-- you were saying?
no point in treating the symptom and not the disease.
your stunt generated quite a few responses. Let's take a look.
I'm way ahead of you. - Paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to spinal tumor.
no. No hypercalcemia. No muscle spasms or incontinence.
you are possessed by the biblical demon "legion.
no, no jumping off cliff in a herd of pigs.
otherwise it did fit.
graves' disease. - No. Thyroid levels are normal.
you want us to spend the next few days shooting down every theory in the world, or can we do our jobs and come up with one that works?
I want you to test me for amyloidosis.
that your professional opinion?
it's the wisdom of crowds.
studies show the collective decision of a group can be more accurate than any individual's decision.
I went through my emails. Amyloidosis got the most votes.
if you had amyloidosis, there'd be speckling on your cardiac ultrasound.
in 100% of cases?
fine. I'll make you a deal. We'll do a kidney biopsy to test for amyloidosis.
when it comes back negative, you pull your case off of the internet and retract the reward.
it's either that, or I don't test you at all.
deal.
if you wanted a quickie, you should've called ahead.
I'm a mess.
came home for lunch.
you have lunch with cuddy on tuesdays.
she was busy.
and you are checking upon me.
you know, you can talk to me.
is that my laundry?
you were running out of socks for me to borrow.
you got plenty of underwear, though.
I'm fine.
you said that this morning. - And consist encyproves what?
really. I'm good.
I'll put these in your room.
biopsy showed deposits in the renal endothelium consistent with amyloidosis.
the internet was right.
start him on dexamethasone.
already done.
this may not be the best time for this... but I quit.
I got an offer to joina friend's surgical practice.
um, you don't generally get an offer unless you're looking for one.
I put out some feelers when I found out house wasn't coming back.
I lobbied to keep the department open so you could keep your job.
Yes. That was incrediblyal truistic of you.
it's nothing personal.
actually, I think you're doing pretty well.
but I came here to work with house.
he's a jerk.
we'll be fine without him.
do you know how many resumes we get every day without even asking?
might be a few less after cuddy shuts us down.
the case got solved under your watch.
does it really matter how it happened?
it matters.
what if I'm just not ready for this job?
okay, you're sad.
I could tell you the story about me and my roommate at sarah lawrence.
okay.
her name was lindsey, and she was a cheerleader from iowa.
I broke my toilet this morning.
I'll get my tools.
I blocked the intake valve so I could collect some of house's urine.
Cuddy, he was barely limping.
what did the lab say?
the urine was clean for vicodin.
it did, however, contain strange epithelial cells.
further analysis showed they were from a labrador retriever.
damn. He's using.
no. No.
Vince. Vince. Vince, relax. It's Dr. Foreman.
kill it! Kill it!
No! No! I don't have my blaster!
he's hallucinating'cause he's burning up. Amyloidosis wouldn't do this.
amyloidosis wouldn't do this.
the antipyretics didn't work. Hopefully the cold tubwill get his temp down.
maybe we should see if anyone's sent in other ideas.
maybe the reward money attract-- no.
I'm not letting anyone else jerk us around. The masses were wrong about amyloidosis.
they don't know about the fever.
I'm going with light-chain deposition disorder.
you okay with that?
Yes.
we think you have a disease called lcdd.
it causes protein to build up in your organs.
you think?
we can't definitely confirm the diagnosis.
and our only chance of beating this would be to start you on high-dose chemotherapy.
but I do have to warn you thatn your condition, it might kill you.
do you want me to get you some more information?
you're my doctor. I trust you.
no, you don't. a
you're scared, and you don't want to make this decision.
my career is riding on this case... nowhere near as important as your life.
but I think the best shot for both of us is to treat for lcdd.
okay.
all right, let's get you out of this tub and into chemo.
we know you're back on vicodin.
no. The only thing you know is that I'm a genius who got a dog to pee in your toilet.
you don't know how I did itor, more interestingly, where I peed.
house, you've spent the last three months-- et tu, butte?
you got no reason toe here. He's the oneI was jerking around.
why is your leg better?
it hurts. Please go away now.
if you really think I'm using, how about asking me before taking a wrench to your plumbing?
house, you're an addict. You can't be surprised if we can't take you at your word.
fine. Let's get you some proof.
hide your eyes, ladies.
you too.
my godson made me that mug.
if the lab says that this is retriever too, please let me know right away.
it'd explainmy overwhelming desire to wipe my button your carpet.
thank you for dragging meinto this.
stop the chemo.
he's got fabry's disease.
he was in the tub for an hour. His fingers should have pruned, but they didn'T.
already stopped chemoand confirmed fabry'S.
I'm glad you both agree, but could somebody loop me in here?
we assumed the deposits in your kidneys were proteins, but they were fats.
Fabry's makes them build up in your organs, choke your nerves, keep your fingers from pruning in water.
it's chronic but manageable.
how'd you figure it out?
iodine mumps.
his lymph nodes swelled up after the head C. T.
we thought it was a new symptom, but it wasn't.
it was a reaction to the contrast.
iodine mumps takes lymph nodes off the table. Remove that symptom...
and that just came to you?
I looked through the online responses again.
someone posted it this morning.
heard cuddy made it official.
department's yours. Congrats.
I'm sorry.
I went behind your back.
on a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you?
a 7.
and that's stupid. You did the right thing.
it's my fault you thought you had to go behind my back.
I should've stood upto you.
but you didn't 'cause you didn't want to fight again.
it's our first case. It'll take time to adjust.
what if by the time we get adjusted, we don't like each other anymore?
that's not gonna happen.
you sure?'Cause ever since I took this job, we've been making each other miserable.
I really don't think this is gonna work.
you're breaking upwith me?
no. The other night when I thought I was done, you were there.
I need you.
I don't want to lose you.
why are you...?
you're firing me.
I'm sorry.
I slipped.
you took vicodin?
25000
I solved my old team's case.
I was about to take the pills. I nt oinE.
I found people posting medical problems, and... my leg stopped hurting.
I'm supposed to be changing my life.
this is not a change.
well, maybe I was wrong.
says the guy making sand castles in my brain.
we need to keep you from using.
taking your job away, the medical puzzles, nearly drove you back to it.
maybe diagnostic medicine is the key to keeping you clean.
so you're okay with me going online, solving cases?
no.
you can't sit all day in a room by yourself.
isolation fosters depression.
the hospital is partof my old life.
if I go back, I might become... who I was before, pills and all.
that's a possibility.
but could be... the only thing worse for you than going back to diagnostic medicine is not going back.
guess we're gonna find out.
left! Left! He's going left!
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
nowhere to go, button.
what the hell was that? What are we chasing?
go that way.
don't move give up, - donny, - Go this way.
he's going for the roof.
he's going up, go.
damn it.
just go, go!
Donny, no! It's too far!
I can rest at home.
we can't release you for at least two days.
you have two broken bones, a severe concussion, collapsed lung.
but you didn't find anything life-threatening, right?
you fell 30 feet. You should have died.
I think that was the point. Could you shut up?
you have suicidal thoughts?
not once. Never. - He doesn't want to kill himself.
he just thinks he's gonna die soon, so it doesn't really matter-- now you shut up.
I'm the one you're not covering when you pull your crazy stunts.
y do you think you're gonna die soon?
well, my dad, grandfather, and great-grandfather all dropped dead of heart problems right after they turned 40.
lo who turns 40 next week.
I can refer you to a cardiologist, if you-- nah, I've been there, all of them.
I spent my early 30s going from one doctor to another.
every single one says my heart's fine.
and you think they're wrong?
I know they're wrong. But what can I do?
at a certain point, you just got to live your life.
by live your life, you mean risk your life.
if there is something wrong, I know a doctor who will find it.
Oh, god!
I'll be back in ten.
I'm picking lint out of my belly button.
this is ridiculous. I'm converting the study into a bedroom.
huh... six weeks.
longer than I thought it would take... for you to notice that I'm sleeping in your living room, and offer other options.
I didn't expect you to be here this long.
true, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation.
do you really need to deconstruct this?
you didn't want me to sleep where you and amber slept.
okay, yes, you do.
after she died, you converted the study to a bedroom and the bedroom to a study...
except it's not a study, it's a shrine.
can I tell you something?
I wasn't picking lint out of my belly button.
okay. I am not ready to transition from my dead girlfriend's shrine to your... morning glory.
I'll have a mattress delivered and set up for you in the tabernacle.
I just need it tuesdays for animal sacrifices.
Oh, man!
patient's a genetic time bomb.
there's no fuse. He's not a bomb.
right now he's not a patient either.
you saying we ignore three generations of cardiac problems?
I'm not ignoring it. I'm labeling it a coincidence.
you hate coincidence.
we reconciled. It was a whole thing.
big country. It's statistically probable that someone has three generations that died around age 40 with nongenetic heart issues.
dice have no memory. - Genes do.
if we ran a battery of tests on every nonsymptomatic statiscal anomaly
the guy goes every day assuming his life will end at age 40.
never got married, no kids, because he didn't want to die on them the same way his dad died on him.
you want to take this case 'cause he's yet another lonely, sad puppy.
you should have been a vet. - It's a legitimate case.
differential diagnosis for genetic heart conditions.
that sold you? - Marfan syndrome, brugada.
and you? - Emilio hypercholesterolemia.
he's only agreeing with you 'cause he wants to have sex with you.
and by the way, I agree with you too, especially in those pants.
we're not wasting our time.
and last week, chase said that I was the de facto boss.
hospitals don't recognize de facto medical licenses.
let's start with genetic tests. Get an ekg, cardiac cath
and an echo to check the integrity of his heart.
I'll start on blood samples.
ugh... I forgot my watch.
could have sworn I saw you put it on this morning.
must be in the locker room. I'll be right back.
I need to know what your plans are.
first we take berlin.
and then we circle around behind poland and yell,"surprise!
with regards to your employment.
I like things the way they are.
I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you... until now.
pretend time's been going on long enough.
I don't have a medical license. Ali can do is pretend.
and I'm gonna have payroll send you over some pretend checks starting tomorrow.
you need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify.
no, I don't.
I'm not saying you don't win.
I'm just sayingdo you really need to punish meby making me carry a clipboard for your lackey of the week?
it's a state requirement.
I have to certify that you've completed all your require-- exactly.
the requirement sets out what you have to do-- certify, which you can do with one hand tied behind your back.
now, if you want to tie my hands...
Dr. Singh supervises rounds on thursdays, starts at 7: 00.
nothing. - So what now?
send him home.
to continue believing he's gonna drop de?
when he turns 70, he'll beli.
e us there are other things we can check.
skeleton of great-grandfather's in decent shape.
subsurface genetic material from grandpa's fine, leaving one bowl of purified dad.
you do the dad. I take it he had a sealed casket.
the watch story was crap, right?
I forgot it.
it's no big deal.
you were avoiding the icu where dibala died.
I'll sequence the gene for the cardiac sodium channel.
I felt like I was gonna have a panic attack.
I've crossed some line... and I'm having trouble getting back to the other side.
I can move the patient to another room.
cameron will ask questions.
you should tell her. She's your wife.
how'd you get a court order to dig them up so fast?
we just needed the guy's consent. - You find anything?
not yet. But you're justin time to do the dad.
doctor house?
he'll be backin the morning.
I read in the paper you're treatinga police officer. Donny compson?
second floor. A nurse willhelp you find him.
I don't want to see
Donny and I used to go outa long tim
he doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.
so did you come to see mefor personal advice?
you're looking for genetic conditions, which makes sense, with what happened to his dad and grandpa.
unless you were his girlfriend and his sister, you got nothing to worry about.
I'm not worried about me.
Donny doesn't know this, but he has a son.
dial extension 742.
tell dr. Foreman you got some cool information. Good night.
you okay? - Yeah, fine.
couldn't find any consistent genetic mutations across 15 areas between donny's ancestors, possibly indicating there isn't one.
but the son gives us a new data point. - And undegraded dna.
I thought he didn't want kids. - He didn'T.
Where's house?
dear bleeding hearts,"since your patient's med history is a coincidence, "and he isn'T...
sick,"I've gone back to school. Back in 120 hours" - Charming. I'll get a blood sample.
if we're looking for something as subtle as a mutation, it makes sense to get the dna where it's most pure.
you're gonna ask the mom to consent to a bone marrow biopsy?
she wants to know if there's something wrong with donny just as badly as we do.
right.
spike a ten-year-old's hip because grandpa was sick.
if she's right... we save two people.
I don't want to.
can we speak outside for a moment?
Yeah.
you need to tell him.
I can't.
his father is down that hallway through those double doors.
I've been lying to him his whole life. What's he gonna think of me?
you're tryingto protect him.
Donny never wanted kids. He certainly doesn't want to meet him.
if donny does die, this could be michael's only chance to meet his father.
after administration of immunoglobulin, patient had no further pain, and overnight liver function tests are now normal.
patient's ready to be released.
stats are dropping. - Doctor singh?
she's choking.
on your fingers. - She can't breathe.
house... please take your finger off the test button.
I see. Wow, sorry about that.
I could've slither throat. - Well, we're all here to learn.
you know, dr. Cuddy warned me about you.
she tell you how to stop me?
look, I'm asking you as an adult to please stop.
well, that obviously didn't come from her.
but fair enough.
excellent presentation, nona.
now I've done it.
there's urine everywhere!
gosh. The great thing about the teacher-student relationship is the teacher can often learn more from the student.
have you learned anything yet?
you have a son.
I was pregnant when we broke up.
I'm sorryI never told you, but I knew how you felt about having kids.
you had no right.
maybe. It's a little late for that.
he's here. He wants to meet you.
I don't want to meet him.
I've never asked you for a dime.
he's here to help find whatever's wrong witharour heT.
I didn't ask him. I didn't want him.
just say hi to him.
I'm michael.
I'm your--uh.- yeah, your mother told me.
when you get better, maybe we could do something.
see a movie?
no.
my dad died when I was your age.
it was the most painful thing I ever went through.
trust me, as much as I'm sure this hurts right now, it's better.
please take him out of here.
chromosomes for 28 cardiovascular conditions are normally numbered in structure.
no translocations, deletions, or inversions.
I didn't notice that the kid's d-a-d-d-y chromosome has been severely damaged by someone else's bleeding heart chromosome.
it was the only way to get michael to do the marrow biopsy.
I'm sure there are plenty of lies would've worked just as well, except without the years of therapy.
don't you have school? - Recess.
so where does that leave us? Chase?
sorry. What?
I was saying,"do you think these shoes work in this color?"Send him home.
he's not gonna believe he's healthy. - You're not very goodat your job.
you don't deserve candy. - He's been preparing his whole life to die at age 40.
he's had dozens of doctors tell him he's fine. You think you can change his thinking?
Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.
great contributions back there.
there's no case. I had nothing to add.
you had nothing to add... because you were distracted.
a little devil on your shoulder told you to kill a guy, and now the little angel won't shut up, telling you you're gonna burn in a lake of fire.
I'm fine.
you shouldn't be.
talk to someone.
docs fixed me up in seven weeks.
You're...ten minutes, tops.
Thanks.
glad we had this little moment. Come on.
I'm dr. House.
you couldn't find anything, could you?
you have ortoli syndrome. dr. Chase?
you sure? - Tests don't lie.
right.
well, it's--it's A... it's a very rare disorder that short-circuits the adrenals, which short-circuits the heart.
blah, blah, blah, blah.
who cares about medical mumbo jumbo? Tell him the treatment.
It'S...well, it's--it's complicated.
doctors always want to make everything sound so complicated.
it's nabasynth.
what? - Nabasynth.
Yes.
so all we have to do now is write a prescription and, uh, have him pick up the pills.
that's it?
I take some pills, and I'm gonna be okay?
the real tragedy here is that the tiburon swab technology didn't exist to detect ortoli back in your dad's day.
he could've lived.
thank you.
if you'll sign these discharge papers, I'll get you a bottle of meds.
take one twice a day for a week, you'll livea long, healthy life.
answer the door, house. It's got to be for you.
are you watching tv?
it's the door!
were you on the phone? - No.
just now, were you talking? - No. I'm alone.
you okay, house?
why are you here?
Donny collapsed four hours after we discharged him. He's dead.
his apartment manager found him on the floor in the laundry room.
said he wasn't breathing.
he called the emts, but it was too late.
I sent the guy home with mints.
whatever it is, we all missed it.
I missed the fact that there was something to miss.
what is wrong with me?
you had good reason.
patient presented with no symptoms, and all his tests came back negative.
what's the officialcause of death?
autopsy hasn't been performed yet.
EMTs brought him to general, but I requested they ship him back to our morgue for the postmortem.
good.
hon. Wake up.
y are you dressed? You go to sleep?
I want to go tell cheryl that donny died.
it's 4: 00 in the morning.
they're nearlytwo hours away. I figure by the timeI get there, she'll be awake.
babe, come back to bed.
call her in a few hours.
it's the sort of thingshe needs to hear face-to-face.
is everything okay?
everything's fine. Why?
last week, I understoodthat you were stressed out about the dibala "m" and "m,"and I gave you your space.
but that's over now, and you're still acting...
I'm worried about you.
don't be. I'm fine. Really.
and you'd tell meif you weren't?
promise?
Yeah.
okay. I love you. - I love you too.
Donny compson, age 39.
can we cut to the money shot?
it's his heart, so let's look at his heart.
nice y-incision.
you can't perform an autopsywithout a medical license.
Really?
cause I don't think there'sanything I could screw up that we haven'talready screwed up.
opening postmortem incision. Beginning at the midlineof the sternum.
that's odd.
Lmosit at looks like he'S... bleeding.
I think the autopsy's gonna haveto wait a little bit.
he was briefly conscious, then his systolic dipped below 60, and he was out again.
differential diagnosisfor resurrection. Go.
obviously he wasn't dead. His heart slowed enough that the emts
Yes, the fact that he's not deadmeans we did absolutely nothing wrong.
there's several documented cases where tetrodotoxin ingestioncaused apparent death.
it wasn't something he ate. It's something he already had.
and his dad, and his grandpa, and-- extreme bradycardia could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.
sinoatrial block.
what if it's nothis heart?
let's work from the tenuous assumption that we're not idiots who've spent days examining a heart up, down, sideways
declaring it healthy just a few hours before it basically shut down.
so we need to think about causes in places you didn't look.
could be metabolic.
you okay?
Yeah.
what abouta genetic predisposition to an autoimmune disease?
isolated anti-ro antibody could cause complete heart block.
could also be passed through four generations.
autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.
how you feeling?
my whole head is killing me.
you just came through a severe trauma.
what do you remember?
I was changing my laundry over to the dryer.
that's it? You were declared dead.
you made it all the way to autopsy.
my jaw aches.
and obviously I don't have ortoli syndrome.
it's hard to get too excited about coming back from the dead when anything I do, anything you give me-- it all ends the same way.
outer and middle ear respond well.
hearing thresholds are normal at all frequencies. Eardrum is perfectly healthy.
what if I, uh... if I sometimes hear whispering?
then you're probably hearing someone whispering.
I had some dental work done in the philippines when I was a kid.
adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up A. M.Radio signals.
open your mouth.
your fillings don't touch.
so there's no reason for me to be hearing things.
I can only tell you that you're hearing sounds as you should.
if you're also hearing sounds that you shouldn't, well, that would be psychosis.
you'd have to talk to someone who does brain. I only do ears.
Bravo!
it's amazing how you did 120 hours in one day.
I wasn't on my best behavior. I admit.
allow me.
from now on, I'm gonna supervise your practicum requirements.
that won't be necessary. - You want to annoy another doctor first?
Eventually--it's not necessary, because I'm not ready to be a doctor again.
I'm sorry.
are you sleeping out here?
Just...dozed off in front of the tv.
with bedding? - Maybe!
I can't sleep in there. The heater's screwed up.
if you need to talk... if--if you need more help
I'm just tired.
I'm right here.
great. Can you be right here somewhere else?
my jaw still hurts.
my tooth--actually, a lot.
I'm sorry, you're maxed out on your pain meds.
try to sleep.
dentist looked at the tooth the guy pulled out.
ther was nothing wrong with it.
so aside from him being an idiot, what else have we learned?
the pain is real. It's coming from somewhere.
what about bone cancer?
you can't connect bone cancer to the heart.
house figure this can wait till the morning?
actually, he told cuddy he's not ready to work.
he quit? - Apparently.
it's a power play. He'll be back tomorrow.
bone cancer could trigger a paraneoplastic syndrome, which shuts down the heart.
primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.
Li-fraumeni syndrome. It's hereditary, and it increases a person's risk of having bone cancer.
you ha another theory?
my theory is it's not bone cancer.
gamma survey would locate the tumors.
I had pea soup today.
you'd love my breath right now.
I didn't get a chance to run tonight. House is... is having issues.
I missed you a lot today.
all I want to do is...
you know.
no cancers on the lateral cuneiform bone.
Navicular's also clean.
chase is lying to me.
and I know you know. Tell me what's going on, please.
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told him... talk to your spouse.
no breakfast?
not today.
I'm hallucinating.
what happened?
it's nothing visual this time.
I hear whispering.
is that why you've been acting so weird? Is that why you quit?
I'm losing it.
I'm sure there's a rational explanation. The wind? A neighbor's tv?
I checked everything. What's really scary is that I hear whispering while not on vicodin.
I'm gonna check myself back into mayfield.
okay.
okay?
you don't think there might be a logical explanation? Something I missed?
you're the smartest guy I know. If you haven't thought of it, it doesn't exist.
I'll drive you over. I just need to make some tea first.
you know.
that you're an ass? Yeah.
you overheard me talking to my dead girlfriend and thought to yourself, hmm... what kind of fun can I have with this?
why are you talking to her? You run out of living people?
you can talk to me. I'm right here.
I miss her. Talking to her makes me feel better.
you don'T.
patient lauren maybaum, 27, presented two days ago with severe abdominal pain.
sorry I'm late.
yesterday you said you weren't ready. - Yesterday I wasn't. Today I am.
and tomorrow is it possible for me to get a five-day forecast?
I'm feeling much better. Thank you for not asking.
either you did have a problem-- which I can't ignore.
or you were jerking me around-- which I can't ignore.
you are a woman. You can do anything.
for example, I can talk to you outside.
are you sure you're only one woman?
this is the part where you play the employee, and I play the boss.
I can see your nipples. Your turn.
these kids are--no wonder she hates him.
mm, that's not hate.
it's foreplay. - It's inappropriate.
gamma survey revealed no tumors.
so it'snot bone cancer.
Where's chase?
don't know.
two mysteries, cool.
theories?
did I come in too soon?
okay, I'm gonna take another lap.
and I want three new ideas by the time I come back.
one of them's got to be not stupid.
where there's pain...there's nerves.
hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, Pe one miscommunition in the brain stem mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.
it would explain the bradycardia too.
and I like the word "hereditary" in the title.
carbamazepine fixes him. - I'll get him started on the medication.
Nope, chase specifically asked if he could do it.
sleep at home.
so I didn't do the gamma survey. Is it bone cancer? - No.
you should congratulate me for not wasting your time.
are you getting some help?
or is this the way things are gonna be from now on?
what's pathetic is you haven't gotten help because you want to feel bad.
you want to suffer,'cause if you feel guilty, then you're not a psychopath.
patient needs some carbamazepine.
now, I don't care how much that room scares you, you're doing your job.
how long before you cross this one off the list?
a couple of hours.
you ever shoot anyone?
twice.
you ever kill anyone?
no.
I know a few guys who did, thoug - did they ever get over it?
a captain I know compares it to taking out the trash, like it's nothing.
other hand, I got an ex-partner who nearly drank himself into oblivion.
did he get help?
Yeah.
help didn't help.
Oh, god!
what is it?
I went to the bathroom.
patient's lost bowel control.
means we were wrong about h-san, and it means he's getting worse fast.
wouldn't want to be the duty nurse assigned to his floor.
get it? "Doody" nurse?
fine. Do the doctor thing.
an autoimmune disorder could explain-- we put him on steroids. He didn't respond.
it's not autoimmune. - Could be wilson's disease.
a disease that advanced would've hit the liver.
it is possible the liver's so far gone, the labs look normal.
it's worth a shot.
go treat with penicillamine.
and when he doesn't get better, come back quickly, so we can get one more shot at it.
bless me, father, for I have sinned.
take your time.
how long has it been since your last confession?
I killed a man. - how
but it was the right thing to do.
who lives or dies is not your decision to make.
sometimes in the operating roomit feels like it.
I'm a doctor.
well, then you should know more than anybody that every human life is sacred.
Why?
tell me what's sacred about a dictator that kills hundreds of thousands of his own people.
what is sacred about a doctor who kills a patient?
is it just the slippery slope you're worried about?
afraid that forgiving me for killing the worst person on earth sets a bad precedent?
I promise... I won't tell anyone.
just forgive me.
saying ten hail marys isn't going to do you any good.
then what do I have to do?
what does god need me to do?
you can't have absolution without first taking responsibility.
you have to turn yourself into the police.
what... and go to jailfor the rest of my life?
what's just about that?
I did the right thing.
there has to be another way.
you want absolution, I've told you how to get it.
send this into the state licensing board.
I've signed off on all your hours.
y? - Because it's easier this way.
you're uncomfortable with me.
no.
going by the book was pointless. You were gonna learn nothing.
good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension.
there was no sexual tension. - There was tension.
and...it made me feel funny, so...
here.
that's too bad.
I was kind of getting into the whole hot-for-teacher thing.
you sure you're okay?
Yeah. False alarm.
what about us?
we're good... just like this.
you press my buttons, I press yours.
by buttons, you mean...
you do make me feel funny.
you're not gonna die.
I've accepted it. It's okay.
in addition to high arches and some crystal bowl in the shape of a tuna, you also inherited a self-destruct button.
it formsin the brain stem.
Llchnicay, it's an aneurysm.
presses on the nerves, that control everything from tooth pain to heart rate.
as you get older, it gets bigger, until finally... the button
which I'll call intracranial berry aneurysm,'cause I had a friend in high school with that na
stops the signal from your brain to your heart. And bam!
how do I know you're not still lying to me?
saying I'm healthy just to make me feel better?
it does sound that way, doesn't it?
but this time, no sugar pills.
I'm gonna cut into your brain to make you think that I'm fixing it.
and if our fake tests confirm it, I'm gonna be cutting into your son's brain too,'cause I'm just that committed.
Michael's gonna be okay?
unless he walks out of here and gets run over by a bus, in which case, I will reconsider your fate argument.
you want to give him a call?
visiting hours don't apply to my patients.
yeah... in a bit.
Yeah.
that's what I thought.
the "saving the kid from pain" stuff was crap.
you just don't want anything in your life that won't let you do whatever the hell you want to do whenever the hell you want to do it.
you've had it easy.
sorry to screw you up.
I've learned to say good-bye mom?
to say good-bye too young I've learned to duck from words like bullets maybe when we get out of here...
what kind of movies you like?
how long can you pray?
he's been missing for eight hours.
never mind, he just walked in, sorry.
you could've called me.
Oh, I-I forgot.- To call me? It's 2: 00 in the morning.
where were you?
Ooh, you're drunk.
all right, I... I needed to get wasted.
I did.
and now I'm better.
what aren't you telling me?
nothing.
Hi, dad.
I think I've been... focusing on the wrong thing.
there were some good times.
this is stupid.
you see, he really is getting better.
sure, let's give up now. It's no big deal.
it's just Pharmacide. Just their tour kickoff.
I mean, who cares if we miss the most insane party in the world?
come on, Phoeb.
victory or death.
or possibly cake.
look, I'm sorry.
sorry, your caffeine fix is on its way.
will you hold on?
we're the dj's assistants.
hold on.
no, I said we both work for him.
you mean her.
the dj's a she-jay.
its okay, Dave.
she's my "plus one.
make that "plus two.
you weren't worried, were you?
Yes. And there will be punishment unless you tell us everything.
you've been here all night?
after the party, we went up to the presidential suite with the band.
it was ginormous. Like, ten rooms.
we had a few drinks and some weed and played "drummer god" on this giant plasma tv.
which she rocked, by the way.
I think i hate you right now.
colt took me up to the roof, but by then the gate to the pool was locked.
so no one was up there.
so we just climbed over and jumped down and, um... went skinny dipping.
did you do it?
no. He was so sweet.
later, he played his guitar, and he wrote a song for me.
Oh, my god!
Jord, what happened to your foot?
maybe you twisted your ankle when you jumped.
or it could be your allergies.
my aunt was allergic to some cold medication, and her hands swelled up like the marshmallow man's.
Jord, are you okay?
foreman expects me to read an x-ray on this itty-bitty screen.
he should have emailed me a larger phone.
why are you packing?
we're leaving this afternoon for the conference on pharmacology and public policy.
we? - We discussed this.
it's been on your calendar for weeks.
so has Ramadan. - Think of it as a vacation.
nice, healthy Adirondack air.
or not. I don't care. You're coming with.
you should come with me.
state pillow fighting championships.
dollar beers, wet t-shirts.
in the words of the philosopher Eddie Money, I've got two tickets to paradise.
house, when you moved in i promised your therapist I'd be here for you.
I can't be here if I'm there.
unless you're there too. So it's not a discussion.
fine.
I'll let Foreman know that the 16-year-old patient with severe edema can wait.
relax. I've got no idea what's wrong with her.
so odds are, not fatal.
still not going!
she's got rhabdo.
who wants to come to the pillow fighting championships?
rutgers has got a great team this year.
I'm so glad their anchor didn't turn pro.
a 16-year-old girl suddenly has the joints of an 80-year-old.
you think we can discuss this for a second?
it's rhabdo. The patient gave you the answer. She fell down and went boom.
we have to leave in an hour, so should we eenie-meenie?
the fall would explain the lower leg damage, but not the swollen hands.
hard landing caused crushed muscles.
crushed muscles released toxins into the blood stream. Toxins caused swelling in the hands and legs.
just another way of saying it's rhabdo. 59 minutes.
she's a credit card kid. Her parents are architects.
they're working on a project in shanghai.
could you be sitting any further away from Chase and still be in the same room?
it doesn't have to be rhabdo. The swelling could also be caused by deep vein thrombosis.
she has allergies. Could be anaphylaxis or some heart condition that we don't
it can't really be any of those things since it's rhabdo.
I know its rhabdo. Foreman knows its rhabdo.
deep in his heart, even Chase knows its rhabdo.
isn't it annoying when everybody in the room knows something you don't?
I'll test for everything.
he's an ass.
contrast is ready.
she already thinks I'm cheating on her.
maybe this is House's way of telling you to talk to her.
sure. How was your day, honey? By the way, i killed someone.
if i tell her, that's dumping a burden on her forever.
okay.
no sign of obstructions or clots.
tell me what you came here for, House.
I've got a legitimate medical reason.
you must be so proud.
I've forgotten it.
I guess it's no big deal, since I was only using it as an excuse to come check out patty and Selma.
I feel bad. I haven't named your testicles.
word on the street is you set a new personal best for low-cut.
I don't know why you chose to give them the names of somebody's aunts.
it's a compliment. They're always smokin'.
Oh, I remember.
I need you to authorize the medical discharge of a minor.
that's why I'm holding this in my hand.
I haven't finished testing yet, but its rh-- your outbox is three times normal size.
it's not a metaphor.
there's a lot to be done before the weekend.
you could take the papers home with you.
unless you're not gonna be home.
unless you were, for example, going to a medical conference.
I'm driving up with Wilson. - Me too.
you didn't register -- you really care about me.
but Wilson said-- that I have a case? Yeah.
you're authorizing the discharge right now.
that was a metaphor.
busy right now.
is he dying? - Yeah.
in the next ten minutes?
unfortunately, no. He's in a lot of pain.
I've thought about it. You're right. I should go to the conference.
you found out Cuddy's going.
Oh, god, no.
she'll ruin everything.
we leave in two hours.
Please...morphine.
I'm right here. I'm right here, Joseph.
two days away.
you think i should pack ball-y? You can't leave. You lit a fuse.
you need to watch the bomb go off.
the bomb was gonna go off on its own if you kept quiet.
so now you either have to come up with a convincing lie, or tell her the truth.
your choice.
CK levels point to rhabdo. - Of course.
except for the part where imaging shows no sign of muscle crush.
I'm your doctor.
this is lars ulrich, the greatest metal drummer of all-time. You know the song?
good. Drumstick.
another drumstick.
I want you to rock out to the music the way you did last night.
go on. This is a classic medical test. Hippocrates used it. Let's go.
come on, you've gotta keep time! Cross over on the high hat.
let's head bang!
house, what are you doing?
the chart said her potassium's low.
rhabdo elevates the potassium. And monkey drums.
ergo... the levels must've been really low last night.
which causes... - I can't move them.
temporary muscle paralysis.
given this rate of muscle fatigue, there's no way she could've climbed stairs and then a fence to the pool.
low potassium means no jump, means no trauma.
tests mean "yes rhabdo.
ergo, something else caused both the rhabdo and the low potassium.
this time start by getting an accurate history.
be careful. Our patient's a big fat liar.
what did you really do last night?
we need to find the cause of your low potassium.
you could have a kidney disorder, leukemia, adenoma.
we need to know about any drugs or alcohol.
anything that might have threatened your health.
come on, Jord.
okay, we didn't spend the night with the band.
you can't tell our friends.
have you heard of stiletto: warrior queen of space?
it's a comic book right?
thank you. - Yeah.
Yes, and a freaking amazing new sci-fi series.
and they're filming the motion picture now.
it's a prequel.
the other girls wouldn't get it.
only phoebe understands my passion.
only phoebe understands the bushido of the heel.
so what actually happened last night?
we were with our friends trying to get into the Pharmacide tour party at the Adams.
and then i found out that Jeffrey Keener's gonna be there.
I follow his tweets.
it's tragic that I have to explain this.
he's the creator of stiletto issue number one.
and the TV show. - He's a god.
so did you guys go up to him?
God, no. We keep a ten-foot rule.
it's not stalking if you don't go up to the person and bother them.
so we just followed him around. - Discreetly.
he ditched after half an hour and went down to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.
and you went with him? - Discreetly.
we played it so cool.
for two hours, we lived his life.
we did everything he did. Ate the exact same meal he ate.
cool.
the rest of their story checks out.
the hotel manager says mom and dad were charged for food and a room, three pay-per-view episodes of stiletto.
are you trying to kill yourself?
it's from the same batch the girls ate.
they ate what he ate. And what a hundred other healthy people ate.
dig in. Lunch is on the Adams.
what if food is the answer?
not this food. Any food.
jordan says she ate all of this.
she's 16, all about body image, and she obviously worries about fitting in.
bulimia would account for her symptoms.
we should do a barium swallow for Mallory-Weiss Tears, start her on nutritional supplements, get a psych consult.
why are you reading my program guide?
it's not like you plan on attending any of the presentations.
I like to know how much boredom I'm missing.
patient perceptions of complications in end-stage chemotherapy.
you didn't tell me you were giving a paper. - And that was wrong?
last time you presented a paper, you gave me an advance copy and asked for feedback.
and you're wondering why i wouldn't want to repeat that experience?
Oh, look! A '80s party.
just when you think you left flock of seagulls behind in your rearview mirror, suddenly it's up ahead like an undead hitchhiker.
Cuddy's going.
did you pack my leg warmers?
if you want her... ask her out.
my god, man!
she's not some floozy in a bar.
she's the floozy I work for.
there's gotta be no radical steps here. Gotta be subtle.
we happened to attend the same party.
the chat happens to turn personal.
like the frog in gradually boiling water.
exactly. She'll be red and delicious before she knows it.
what?
what could possibly go wrong?
chase went to the gym five times this week.
okay.
one of those times I followed him.
what?
I followed him. And yes, I know how humiliating that admission is.
Where'd he go?
the gym, that time. But i know that something's-- I'm stopping you right there.
this is a conversation you should be having with Chase, not me.
I've tried having this conversation with Chase.
no sign of tears. It's not bulimia.
is he having an affair?
no.
why should I believe you? - You shouldn't.
you should believe him.
baby... sweetie... how are you?
Jordan! - Normal sinus rhythm.
heart rate's fine.
bp's dropping.
what's happening to her? - No pulse.
Oh, my god!
you said her heart rate was fine.
cardiac tamponade. Drain the fluid now.
what is going on?
she's bleeding around her heart.
blood constricted her heart muscle.
she's on antiarrhythmics, but we don't know how long we can keep her stable.
seemed to be triggered by stress. Her parents had just did her blood pressure drop during the barium swallow?
dropped to 50 systolic in three minutes. - Rules out chronic conditions.
acute conditions limit us to toxins, infections.
could be anything. A gas leak, arsenic in the wallpaper, fungus in the shower.
I'll get samples from her room and the restaurant.
talk to our little gossip girl.
you need to know exactly where she's been and what she's done in the last 24 hours.
Oh, I think-
welcome to the convention, Dr. Perlmutter.
it's my 25th consecutive year.
perlmutter loves the '80s.
do you need me to leave too?
you might remember stuff she doesn't.
we didn't do anything we haven't told you about.
we hung out at Jordan's all day.
and then we called a limo to go into the city.
we stopped at Bruce Springsteen's House.
Jord... don't joke around, okay? You're really sick.
just tell him the truth.
Bruce let me play the first electric guitar he ever owned.
my god, why are you lying?
how can you not believe me?
turn to your right.
Mr. Keener, I really appreciate you coming.
Oh, it's not that much of a hike. My room's only six floors up.
last night, do you remember two girls, about 16?
that table right there.
they made an impression.
well, they were hard to miss with the giggling and the staring.
I'm sure that happens to you a lot.
I'm sure that happens to you a lot more.
she can't control it.
a bleed in her brain is affecting her thalamus, causing her to lie.
we need to know everything. You two were never apart?
except for when she went to go get ice.
but that couldn't have taken very long.
you don't know? - It was in the middle of the night.
I woke up when she came back into the room.
and she told you she went to get ice?
*we can dance if we want to *
we can leave your friends behind 'cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance well, they're no friends of mine say, we can act if we want to if we don't, nobody will and you can act real rude...
house... 1980s.
you sure?
they weren't specific.
how much did it cost you to rent that?
it was in Wilson's bag.
Dr. Perlmutter, I read your article on neural degeneration.
wait, you didn't really take that seriously, did you?
I just wrote that for the money.
well, hey there, Jane Fonda.
would you care to dance?
sorry, we were just about to hit the floor.
thank you.
your leg? - I'm okay.
as long as you don't expect rhythm.
you remember the last time we danced?
med school, the week we met.
no.
I saw you in endocrinology.
tracked you down to the hoedown.
I meant, we met before that. In the bookstore.
my third day of school, I hand my syllabus to the guy behind the counter.
he barely looks at me. Just skims the sheet and tells me I'm overly ambitious, I have a chip on my shoulder, and I know how to party.
I'd forgotten you knew how to party.
I said,"you're making that up.
and you said, "your class schedule is overloaded.
but none of your classes are before 11: 00,
and no one takes professor Lamb's course unless they have something to prove.
because professor Siegal covered the same ground and was the easier grader.
I tracked you down.
Endocrinology... the party.
and one thing led to another.
and then it didn't.
I was gonna call you.
no... don't do that.
there was no expectations. I was just as into it-- I was gonna come see you.
figure out where things would go from there.
that was the morning I got the call from the dean and i was expelled from my first med school, and there didn't seem any point.
I should go to my room and review papers for the infectious disease panel.
after my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray watching through windows...
Hello?
Yeah. Thanks for telling me.
7: 00 in the morning. Somebody better be dead.
my patient, Joseph Schultz.
under the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have happened, right?
Yeah. I just wish I had been there.
didn't hear you come in last night.
Yes, and it was almost 9: 30.
things didn't go as you planned?
we've moved on to a new phase.
I tell Cuddy that I've always been interested in her, and she walks out of the room.
well, either she just wasn't ready for that, or maybe she was just surprised and didn't know how to react.
what are you doing? - Interesting reflex of guilt just now.
your patient's been dying for six weeks.
you couldn't have predicted he'd go this weekend.
or could you?
Euthanasia: let's tell the truth.
we all do it.
that's a great opening line.
are you insane?
I didn't want your notes before, and I don't want them now.
well, she didn't get ice.
she got out in the lobby. She could have gone anywhere.
let's start with for how long.
fast forward.
stop. Rewind. Back.
wherever she went, she was only gone for, like, five minutes.
she's holding something. - It's Keener's journal.
he must have left it in the restaurant that night.
she went back, claimed it belonged to her.
she was looking for an excuse to knock on his door.
I know what you're gonna say.
I'm not insane.
doctors are rarely indicted.
I was just thinking of your career.
but yeah, if you're one of the doctors occasionally idicted, I guess it could affect that.
someone needs to say what life is really like now for people who are dying.
what doctors have to go through, the decisions we have to make.
alone. Without guidance.
someone should say that... in an unsigned letter to the times.
I'd be telling the truth. I'd be saying what we're all thinking.
who cares? The oncology department is subsidized by drug companies.
they don't want it run by a murderer.
we're all murderers. We just don't have the guts to admit-- and once again, who cares?
you won't be hirable anywhere.
if there's one thing I've learned from you, it's that I should do what I think is right and not worry about the consequences.
Yeah, it's worked out great for me.
um, i don't mean to be rude, but I'm expecting a notes call from l. A. Can we make this quick?
did Jordan come to your room the other night?
let me put it another way. We know Jordan came to your room the other night.
look, I've tried to be helpful.
I don't know why you want to pretend I'm lying to you.
but this is getting too weird for me. - We need to search your room.
you don't, because she was never here. - Allison, calm down.
you would cover your ass at the expense of someone's life?
we know she brought up your journal.
that was helpful.
he'd be crazy to risk his marriage for a one-night stand with a teenager.
sensible people only risk their marriage for something more serious?
I'm not having an affair.
we're talking about Keener. - Fine.
he doesn't care about his marriage. What about his career? Statutory rape would ruin it.
it's admitting statutory rape that could ruin it.
which is why we'll never hear the truth out of him.
Rufies od explains all her symptoms. We should start treating her with flumazenil.
isn't the MRSA panel going on?
we got kicked out. She started crying.
Yeah, well, discussions of urinary catheterization will do that to me too.
the babysitter had an emergency.
Oh...how did you like '80s night?
house talked with you?
I was being subtle about it.
you left suddenly.
I know House can be a little much sometimes... - No, he was sweet.
I just know better than to rely on that.
he's trying. - Yeah. I know.
I'm a mother now.
I need a guy i can count on every single day.
that's never been House.
it's not rufies.
she's bleeding behind her kidneys.
we're transfusing another two units packed red cells, but she keeps springing leaks.
it looks like a toxic reaction.
keener must have given her something.
the guy's a comic book writer, not a drug dealer.
there's a lot that wouldn't show up in a standard tox screen. But he's never gonna tell us the truth.
not gonna get the truth out of her either.
we will if we drug her.
amobarbital would suppress her thalamus.
she's on antiarrhythmics. Amobarbital could stop her heart.
she's already dying.
you're angry at me.
you're taking it out on this guy 'cause you think he's lying to you too.
and you're gonna kill our patient in the process.
we need to know the truth. - We should call House.
Yeah. He'll recommend we take the cautious approach.
pretzel? - Those are gonna show up on my credit card at seven bucks a bag.
there's an all-you-can-eat buffet downstairs.
studies show that $10 wine tastes better if you're told that it costs $90.
I'm sure the same thing st be true of grape soda.
have one.
we can toast your ending unemployment.
Yes, you can sit here running up my hotel bill, or you can go get the woman of your dreams.
I didn't know Angela Merkel was attending the conference.
I just spoke with Cuddy. She doesn't think you're reliable.
and you will remain friend-zoned until that changes.
I can't convince her that I've changed my entire personality in a weekend.
Yeah, but you could make the first step.
what does she need? - Today, a babysitter.
what are you thinking about? - Fjords.
you see? Seriously.
I know this is out of your comfort zone, but don't scheme.
Don't...just do the deed-- you tell me that I've gotta show her I've changed, and yet you act like you don't believe I can.
if I can't convince my best friend... - I'm sorry.
I didn't mean... I didn't mean... I didn't mean...
you drugged me.
she's better off without you.
words can hurt, you know.
I thought truth serum was only stuff they gave people in lame spy movies.
we know you're scared. But we know you want to tell the truth.
we're gonna help you do that.
what happened between you and Jeffrey Keener the night you went up to his room?
I couldn't believe he even talked to me.
I told him how much his work means to me.
I figured I must sound like a moron.
but he was nice about it.
he said I was special.
heart rate's increasing.
140's acceptable. Let her talk.
did he give you anything? A drink, pills?
he said it was ecstasy.
but it didn't look like ecstasy, and it didn't really make me feel how ecstasy usually does.
how did it make you feel?
it just made me really tired.
what did it look like? A capsule? Tablet?
it was a tablet. Round. - Could be lithium.
he just started touching me.
at first it seemed nice.
but then... I didn't want to insult him.
that's enough.
I'm so sorry.
I love you guys so much, and I just-- I feel like I've let you down.
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
before you do that, look here.
increased periorbital blood flow throughout.
it means everything she's been saying has been a lie.
everything?
s-so you still don't know what's wrong with her?
sorry.
Oh, I thought you were room service.
something going on with your patient?
it's quiet in there. Is Rachel asleep?
I thought maybe you could use a babysitter.
actually, I've got her in day care downstairs.
great.
maybe later.
Hey, House. - Hey, Lucas.
this is awkward. - A bit.
that awkwardness would probably go away if I left.
it's Foreman. I'm trying to update house, but his phone's off.
he's not here.
patient's losing blood faster than we can transfuse.
cameron did an online search and found out Keener travels with his dog-- we're treating for rickettsia.
any idea where he is? - Oh, no!
I was supposed to be giving a paper five minutes ago.
Okay...okay...
Dr. Wilson has asked me to tender his apologies for his absence.
you'll be hearing my paper instead.
unfortunately, there wasn't time to correct the program schedule.
Euthanasia: "let's tell the truth.
we all do it. "We just don't talk about it." We play the game.
we use other words or we don't use any words at all.
nice phrasing.
Hello?
uh...I don't know what department i want.
uh, I need...pants.
patient s, a 55-year-old man."end-stage lung cancer.
his pain was beyond the point, where we could even pretend to treat it.
I showed him how to use the morphine pump.
I told him too much morphine would kill him,"but not to worry.
the machine only gives out so much.
to override it you need to enter a special code.
I went to the door, and told the nurse, the code is 328.
I said it loudly.
when he first came to my office, I told him I would be with him every step of the way.
but I left him alone at the end.
I broke that promise to cover my ass, I failed
I was wrong when I wrote that.
I've never given any less than my best.
I am incapable of turning away from a responsibility.
my friends take advantage of that fact far too often.
I know that I gave that man everything I could.
and I know that he knew that too.
this is a burden no one should have to carry alone.
and this is a decision no one should make alone.
because frankly, I don't trust all of you.
doctor. Doctor. Doctor? Doctor?
question... - Excuse me, doctor.
not many people would have your courage.
thank you, Dr. Perlmutter.
before I start shouting, Foreman says they're looking at rickettsia.
thanks for the message. Continue.
what the hell? You think that little shout-out is gonna make me forget that you drugged me, hid my pants, stole my speech?
you wanted the paper out there, it's out there.
and your job is safe. That was my paper.
you don't ask what I want, you ignore my wishes, You drug me.
I'm waiting for you to name something new to our relationship.
you've got no good reason to be angry with me.
Oh, really? I should be thanking you?
if this was about getting the story out there, then yeah.
of course, if this is actually about something else...
maybe you feeling impotent because patients keep dying and you think you need to make some grand, stupid gesture.
you need to be a hero-- well, then, yeah, sorry.
I did screw it up.
you stepped over the line. This was not your decision.
my god, there are 10, 000 oncologists in this country.
every one of them loses patients.
but only you would feel guilty enough...
of course, we can't even argue on my schedule.
it's house.
take down the bags.
it's too soon to tell if the meds are gonna-- It's not the meds.
it's the blood that's killing her.
what's everybody doing? You're stunned, right?
I mean, blood? - She's had internal bleeding.
she needs the blood to-- is that the mom?
I've got a good comeback if it's the mom.
Yes, I'm her mother.
sure, she needs blood, if you want to kill her.
then you'd have nobody left to neglect--great plan.
your daughter has vibrio vulnificus, courtesy of a few scrumptious oysters on the half shell.
I didn't eat any oysters.
thus proving that she did. Boy, that's neat.
100 other people ate those oysters.
I ate. -- Is that the dad?
I've got a good comeback-- it's Chase.
Oh, I thought the dad might've been Australian too.
there was nothing wrong with the oysters. All oysters have vibrio.
but almost no one has hemochromatosis.
it'd give here a unique susceptibility to vibrio, cause the swollen joints.
but it got attributed to bulimia, so she got supplements.
with iron. - Which overcooked the liver, which caused bleeding.
more blood, more iron, more bleeding, more blood.
is she going to be okay?
only if we give her high-dose ceftazidime for the vibrio and chelate for the hemochromatosis.
now, Cameron, pick up the phone and give me a dramatic exit.
So...how'd you two crazy kids hook up?
I suspected someone in accounting was skimming money, and i wanted to investigate quietly.
and since you introduced me to the only detective i know...
and one thing leads to another.
why keep it a secret?
you protecting me in my fragile state?
you think i was an unhinged looney who was about to go off the rails at a badly timed bit of news?
I just don't advertise my personal life.
I needed help with the baby. Lucas drove up.
Yeah. She was worried. A little worried.
as a friend.
I had to hide in our room and be the dirty little secret.
kinda sucked.
I told her it wasn't necessary. So you had some hallucination about having sex with her.
I don't think we need to talk-- I mean, I imagine having sex with women all the time.
no big deal.
though I guess if they knew what I imagine, it could get awkward.
and I guess it's different because in the fantasy, she was your savior.
but I mean, that was months ago, right?
all the work that you had to do to get straight-- you've been institutionalized.
you've had way bigger stuff to deal with. I should shut up.
can I buy you a ginger ale?
a ginger ale would be good. With lemon.
infection's clearing up nicely. You should be out of here in a few days.
Oh, that is wonderful.
Jack, how are you?
sweetie, your father and I think we should reward ourselves with a little time off.
that meeting's gonna have to wait a couple of weeks.
we're staying here.
you should think about where you'd like to go.
honey, they're saying the specs are wrong for the whole foundation.
can you at least come talk to them?
let me see.
you okay? - Yeah.
no. Soil engineering report was fine.
I'm used to it. - Who are you talking to?
So...about what happened that night.
I never even got up the courage to knock on his door.
well, you'll have to send me their numbers.
Yea!
what is that?
are you driving?
he looks like a guy who'd be there every day.
minibar is restocked.
I say we grab some pretzels for the road-- when you do what i did, it's not enough to tell yourself you did nothing wrong.
you need to hear it from someone else.
if not god or society, a friend.
otherwise you go crazy.
what you said to me up there... thank you.
you're a good friend.
Cuddy should know that.
Yeah, you should let her know that I drugged you so you wouldn't confess to murder.
let's get out of here.
someone could have recognized you.
first u. S. Conference I've attended in 15 years.
Perlmutter?
toronto, all weekend. Airtight alibi.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I always suspect the worst.
if you say you're not having an affair, you're not having an affair.
Oh, god, you are.
I'm not. - Okay. Sorry. Again.
if you don't want to tell...okay.
but I could help.
whatever this is, it's eating away at you.
we could get past it together.
I love you no matter what.
we lose patients sometimes.
one of those patients... Dibala...
we didn't ac-- we didn't actually lose him.
I killed him.
Hey, I'll be right there.
take your time.
you mind if I get a drink of water?
no, not at all. help yourself.
not exactly beach reading, huh?
do you understand any of that stuff?
well, most of these I can get through, But, uh, that one? I can't get past the dust jacket.
Where's Ted? - Laid off.
company's going with per diem workers, you know. You don't have to pay overtime, health insurance.
that sucks. - I don't mind.
really, I'm not a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.
if I could just get you to sign.
right. um... Hang on one second. I want to show you something.
you're gonna laugh, but, uh, I swear, this guy James Sidas looks exactly like you.
wait, hang on a second.
this guy is you. I saw a profile Nova did on you.
you're, like, the youngest guy to ever graduate mit?
standards were lower back then.
you got an iq of 178. published three books and 35 papers all before the age of 18?
Yeah, uh, sorry, I really need to get going. So if I could just get you to sign off.
all right. I'll trade you.
I'll sign if you'll sign.
I'm not that guy anymore. - come on, man.
this is the most exciting thing that's happened in this place in years.
come on. Don't be like that.
I'm paying you a compliment.
it's... It's not that, um... My hand's not working.
you okay?
no.
$2. 32. - Put it on Dr. Wilson's tab.
I don't know who Dr. Wilson is, and we don't have tabs.
do you know who I am?
no. - good.
but, sir-- I got it. it's all right.
Thanks.
although I should make it clear that for two bucks all you get is top half, over the clothes.
any plans for turkey day?
go to my sister's for dinner.
Why?
just making pleasant conversation. I've heard tell of folks doing such.
how 'bout we talk about this?
15-year-old. Recurring migraines and blurred vision.
great.
Really? - sure.
there's no point in putting a band together if we're not gonna play any gigs.
hold on. take this instead.
I was expecting more resistance.
that was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free.
enjoy your drumstick.
ready to save some lives?
32-year-old courier.
ataxia, anemia, mild cough.
ct was clear. tox screen negative.
What're you so excited about?
why wouldn't I be? got all my starters back, plus a couple of first-class free agents.
I feel like mike tomlin.
probably not as much as you do, but you get the idea.
ataxia and anemia could be viral. Maybe west nile?
no fever, lymph glands were normal.
anybody seen Wilson? - Hyperbilirubinemia?
Yeah, like that's a real thing.
meningitis. - Anemia's a stretch.
page Dr. James Wilson at 558.
what about sickle cell?
guy's white. - Whites can get it.
come on. We get the tennis elbow and all the money. Let them have sickle cell.
ttp's a better fit.
he's right.
what, you thought I wouldn't agree with him? Ever?
you didn't agree with him. That's why he dumped you.
Oh, sorry. It was mutual.
we're cool, okay? Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.
sounds passionate.
ttp makes sense to me.
not to me. What if he had a history of-- One big, happy family.
ttp it is.
confirm with a blood smear and adamts13 antibodies.
Dr. James Wilson, please dial 558.
can you cure it? - Ttp isn't completely curable,
but the symptoms are manageable with the proper treatment.
is this the treatment?
no, first we need to do a blood test to confirm the diagnosis.
but he's gonna get better.
honey, that's what she's saying. I'm gonna be okay. Don't worry.
how can't I worry? You're in the hospital.
I'm gonna be fine.
you're sure everything was fine before?
given your educational background, you'd think you could at least find a job with a medical plan.
we have money. Don't worry. It's not that, it's just
I want to make sure we have all the information we should.
my husband wouldn't lie. - It's okay, baby.
he's just doing his job.
he just wants to make sure I'm not a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.
or hiding a history of mental illness?
I work as a courier because I want to.
it's easy. I don't have to think.
it's too hard to think. - No, just unpleasant.
no matter what I did, it really wasn't good enough. Then I met Dara.
she didn't care how smart I was Or what I might accomplish in the future.
it was the first time in my life that iIwas really happy.
so I decided I would rather be happy than smart.
you all right?
sorry. I know you're not okay.
I mean... - She left.
went back to chicago.
any chance of reconciliation?
Nope.
sure you don't want to grab a drink after work?
figured we could talk about the perils of dating doctors.
I wasn't dating cameron.- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
I know what you're doing and I appreciate it, But I've got it under control.
that's what you said about the dibala incident. And obviously you didn't.
and talking about it obviously made things so much better.
didn't you think there was something weird about that guy?
not really. In fact, he seemed pretty normal.
that's my point.
guys with iqs off the chart are usually completely... abnormal.
speaking of house, why'd you come back?
I mean, you must've taken a major pay cut.
life's too short to worry about money. - Your wife feel the same way?
she's happy to cut back on some things... Like sex.
why'd you come back? - why wouldn't i?
like foreman said, nobody's angry.
nobody's hurt.
schistocytes.
that means ttp.
which is what we thought it'd be. Remember? This is a good thing.
this is an easy thing.
and house doesn't take cases that are easy, which means it's not ttp,
and he wants to see how long it takes us to catch up to him.
schistocytes suggest ttp.
good. now what?
normally, we'd try plasmapheresis, But the patient has an albumin colloid allergy.
so?
so that means we have to give him a splenectomy.
Yes, it does.
Wilson?
no. - do you know where he is?
not in here.
you're sure you want us to take out his spleen.
is that what a "splenectomy" is? I thought it was an ice cream treat. Yuck.
so you do really think he has ttp? you're not just testing us.
Yeah, like I have time for games.
so why did you really take this case?
isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.
missed you at breakfast this morning.
and lunch.
I had a dentist appointment.
you know where Cuddy's sister lives?
you see, this is why I don't answer your urgent pages.
because they're not urgent pages.
I've decided what I'm gonna do about cuddy and lucas.
I'm going to break them up. - of course.
it's given me a purpose in life, a goal, a raison d'etre.
albeit a selfish, mean-spirited, childish raison.
I think of it more as benevolent.
there's only two possible outcomes for their relationship.
they split, or they stay together forever.
if it's split, then the sooner it happens the better for everyone.
if it's stay, then my meddling won't matter.
in fact, if they survive it, It might even make their bond stronger.
how you manage to elevate your narcissism to beneficence is masterful.
Indinner.
just 'cause I'm sentimental.
dinner is at Cuddy's sister's, which brings us back-- House, don't.
I fished for an invite. Cuddy wasn't biting, So I'll have to crash.
I have no idea where cuddy's sister lives.
ask and thou shalt receive.
you can't honestly think I would help you with this.
not help me, help Cuddy. remember?
if you don't get it, I'll be forced to use more nefarious methods.
happy holidays.
looks great.
so he's all better?
probably be on some long-term meds, And he's about ten ounces lighter.
other than that, won't even know it's gone.
did you hear that, honey?
you're gonna be just fine.
when can I get out of here?
everything checks out, less than a week.
good,'cause those boxes aren't gonna deliver colors.
colors?
green... And orange... And ceiling.
Mr. Sidas, do you know where you are?
chewing.
shirt... - He's stroking.
call the cath lab now.
Oh, my god.
blood flow's restored. There appears to be no permanent damage.
good news is it turns out to be an exciting, action-packed thrill ride of a case after all.
bad news is we took out his spleen for nothing.
thank god he's still got his appendix and tonsils.
so what looks like ttp, acts like ttp, tests like ttp, but isn't ttp?
cns vasculitis explains ataxia, and anemia, maybe the stroke.
ct would've picked up something.
Hi, I'm Greg House, a friend of your sister Lisa.
could be dic.
sorry. Wrong number. - You gonna ask?
I'm sure he's got a perfectly logical explanation.
can't be dic. No hemorrhaging.
and i'm calling all 12 Julia Cuddys within a 100-mile radius.
see? Completely reasonable.
acquired pancytopenia.
Wbc's normal. - Hey, Julia.
you're, uh-- you're Lisa's sister, right?
you sure?'Cause you are number 12.
maybe she got married and changed her name.
Otis Campbell. - Probably kept her first name.
the mnemonic for toxins. O for organophosphates, T for tricyclics, I for insulin.
or as I remember it,"Moist Place.
that's "Place" spelled with two "l"s and a silent "b.
except the tox screen was negative.
standard tox screen--unstandard toxins don't show up on it.
you two do an unstandard tox screen, you two search his home.
Otis campbell's got to be hiding somewhere.
smartest guy in the world, and this is the best he can do.
maybe he's doing what he loves. Delivering boxes was a childhood dream.
soda, processed cheese, marsh mallow spread.
nothing in here is capable of going bad.
ibuprofen, eye drops, cough syrup.
you want to come over for thanks giving dinner?
you never asked me over before. Why now?
I just never thought of it.
but now that we're both on the team... - And my wife left me?
is that a bad reason?
no. But, uh, I'm okay.
on both the food and friends.
mice.
leptospirosis could explain the ataxia and the anemia.
but not without a fever.
you have someone to talk to?
Yeah. - who?
what, you want names?
look, you lost a friend. I get it. But I'm not Kutner.
good,'cause Kutner never used to come over for dinner.
I'm gonna pretend there's something interesting over here so you'll shut up.
actually, there is.
he's got sketches of atomic structure, this one's full of math proofs.
they're all old. Nothing since '96.
this isn't some homework assignment his parents forced on him.
this is passion.
why would he want to stop doing this?
marriage destroyed his soul.
or maybe it was just the booze.
thank you, doctor, you've been wonderful.
as have you, Diana. be well. - Thank you.
you're helping.
voluntarily.
he's done six already.
figured you might be getting backed up. The holiday season and all.
so which one of us slipped through the wormhole Into an alternate dimension?
I have always loved to travel. And paint.
lucky number seven.
house... I know you're trying to be nice, but I also know you're doing it because you have an agenda.
sexy and smart.
Lucas is a lucky guy.
the question is, is this a bad agenda or a good one?
either you're trying to screw with me, or you're trying to show me that you've really changed.
so which is it? I'm dying to know.
what are you doing for thanksgiving dinner?
peace in our time.
it cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty.
this is a three-hour drive.
have you considered the possibility that this is a fake address?
you think she'd send me to a vacant lot for thanksgiving dinner?
if she's smart. - She is.
that's why I ran it through motor vehicles. Good as gold.
this cannot end well.
I don't want it to end well.
you should come as my date.
you're not gonna want to miss this.
the unstandard tox screen was as clean as the standard one.
but we found vodka stashed away in his place.
what's with the ties?
makes me look adorably non-threatening.
party or party hearty?
liver failure would explain all the symptoms.
party.
so guy's a brainiac, and his secret drug of choice is booze?
that's kind of pedestrian, don't you think?
talk to him. He's a pedestrian guy.
with pedestrian alcoholism.
liver biopsy can wait until after thanksgiving.
Yes, assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us,
it can wait till after new year's.
on the other hand, taub and thirteen can do the liver biopsy today.
why us?
Juniority. Welcome back.
what do you want us to do? - Same as me.
have a happy thanksgiving.
I'm not an alcoholic.
Yes, you just hide vodka around the house for fun.
I drink, just not a lot.
since when do you drink at all?
I have one shot when i get home from work, baby, that's it.
so why lie to your wife about it? - Because it's not important.
what difference does it make?
that you drink every day by yourself?
I have one lousy drink, okay? Have you ever seen me drunk? Ever?
no, but you've obviously been drinking enough to hurt your liver.
my liver is fine. - Hold still.
there we go.
this test is a waste of time.
want some wine? - All right.
very good.
here, we got this.
string beans?
no, I'm the house sitter.
they're in hawaii for the week.
Oh, the games people play every night and every day never meaning what they say...
happy thanksgiving. - Happy thanksgiving, you guys.
you must be Dr. House. I was told I should offer you a turkey sandwich.
talkin' 'bout you and me and the games people play
tuna salad. Closest thing they had to turkey.
Thanks. But I'm hoping I can still get out of here to catch the tail end of dinner with my wife.
anything? - No cirrhosis, no scarring, no infection.
blood panel? - Elevated albumen: 7. 2.
that's it? - Everything else is fine.
so it was a waste of time.
unless it's not his liver that's elevating his albumen. It's his kidneys.
renal failure explains the anemia.
if he developed hyperkalemia, that would explain the ataxia.
but the stroke... Ischemic encephalopathy.
nice.
except now we have to stay and test his kidneys.
key under the mat.
there's no key under the mat.
Oh, right.
you need to replace one of your kitchen windows.
I helped myself to your wine cellar.
I'll leave a buck on the way out.
you're not right for her.
and you are? - Less wrong.
then I started thinking...
what was I saying?
you were saying it's late, and... - She invited me.
she didn't know if she should. She was trying to figure out if I really have changed or...
if I'm just the same old s. o.b. I've always been.
but she always gave me a chance.
832 chances.
and I used up every one of them.
832's her limit. Make a note.
how 'bout a cup of coffee?
it's just instant, but...
I'm pathetic.
I don't deserve her.
okay, okay, all right.
uh, here.
maybe you should crash here.
it's a sofa bed.
I love her.
rhabdomyolysis.
- No edema.
I trust you had a wonderful thanksgiving?
I don't remember.
so I guess I did.
multiple myeloma. - No bone pain.
you got drunk alone?
no. That would be a sign that I need to talk to you about this.
polycystic kidney disease? - No utis or flank pain.
well, what if his cough is more than just a cold?
he hasn't been coughing.
it's in his history, and we found a new bottle of cough syrup in his medicine cabinet.
cough could mean goodpasture syndrome. Affects kidneys and lungs.
start him on immunosuppressors and dialysis.
we'll do it after we run it by house.
he's not answering his pager. Looks like he's leaving it up to us.
us, not you.
and since we don't disagree, you can save your fight for another case.
how long do I have to be hooked up for?
four to six hours a day until we see an improvement.
what if you don't? - Then we keep doing it until he gets a transplant.
you were sure it was his spleen, and then you were sure it was his liver, which he told you it wasn't, and now you're sure it's his kidneys.
it's definitely his kidneys.
we just don't know why it's his kidneys.
any word from cameron?
Nope.
I started seeing a counselor after my diagnosis.
she's really good.
why does everyone assume that everyone works In the exact same way?
we pretty much do.
our egos want us to think we're all snowflakes, no two alike, but really we all want the same things.
love, forgiveness... Chocolate.
well, what I want is for everyone to leave me alone. how do I get that?
what did you say to lucas last night?
I know there were a lot of consonants.
I don't remember how I got here, never mind what I said.
well, I just talked to him. And he said he thought it'd be better If we stopped seeing each other.
said he didn't realize How much there still was between you and me,
and he didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.
I was drunk.
whatever I said, he can't really-- I've had enough, House.
I actually felt bad about scamming you.
but then you lived down to my expectations and then some.
there is no "us.
there never will be.
it worked.
please tell me you're talking about a medical procedure.
they split up this morning.
you're the very first one i've told.
and you think she'll start dating you?
I'm sure she hates you.
but her eyes say,"how will I ever pay you for that tennis lesson?
what a shame.
they'll get over it. - I meant for you.
I'll get over it faster than they do.
can't believe that lucas fell for my "I never say this because it's so personal Except that I'm drunk" profession of love.
second-oldest trick in the book.
you're right. It's his fault because he's stupid.
he certainly is.
you're stupid.
well, I'm rubber, and you're glue.
he's not pedestrian, he's stupid.
at least stupider than he should be. He's a dxm junkie.
dextromethorphan. As in cough syrup?
he wasn't taking it for his cough.
it's cheap, available at your corner drug store, and taken in high doses, it's a dumb drug.
dumb drug. Well, he obviously hasn't
he's smart compared to you.
he's a moron compared to what he was.
robotripping" lowers the iq.
it also causes brain damage.
unless taken with the proper amount of ethanol. About one drink per day.
he wasn't abusing the booze and taking the cough remedy medicinally.
he was abusing the cough meds, and taking the booze medicinally.
Bravo.
why would you do that?
if you had a-- A gift, why would you just throw it away?
I didn't throw it away. I just turned it down a little.
when my brain was on low, everything didn't seem so miserable anymore.
life was bearable.
I thought that I did that.
you do.
long-term abuse of dxm explains all your symptoms.
Even--oh, sweet irony-- your cough.
whole bowel lavage, activated charcoal.
we get all traces of it out of your system. You'll be the unhappiest little courier in no time.
I don't think I can live without it.
you'd be surprised what you can live without.
make him a genius.
I can't believe it. He looks so much better already.
we were thinking about calling gq.
lavage has removed all traces of dxm from his body.
you're drawing again. What is it?
just doodles. - No, it's not.
come on, Jimmy, I want to know.
this is a toroidal helicon plasma device.
it determines the amount of energy expended by the subatomic particles.
I'm thirsty. Could you get me a juice or something?
Yeah, of course. I'm so happy, jimmy.
I told you.
do you know what the difference between her iq and mine is?
91 points. In relation, she's closer to a gibbon than she is to me.
having sex with her would be an act of bestiality.
I assume you didn't marry her for her skill in applied physics.
I just wish she could spell it.
you really think you'd be happier with someone who could spell better?
no.
that's the problem.
I'm the one who's a jerk. But I owe her everything.
I want to want to be with her.
and when I'm clear, I... I can't.
fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath? - Sometimes.
is the wait always this long?
only on days that end in "day." Diarrhea, weight loss?
a bit.
don't you ever shave?
Yeah. Once a week. How 'bout you?
stomach pain, tenderness?
every now and then. Are you this rude to all your patients?
Oh, yes. Don't think you're special.
so we've got a lot of vague, unverifiable symptoms.
yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal.
what do you think I have? - I'm not sure, but I think it's...
a lame job. - What?
you're a rat. Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care.
that's ridiculous. - Is it really?
cause you seem a lot more interested In asking questions than answering them.
handwriting on your medical records is obviously not a doctor's 'cause I can almost read it.
and when you went out for a urine sample, I looked in your purse.
found the list of questions you were supposed to memorize Before you came to the clinic.
I was looking for gum.
you're an ass. - Put it in your report.
I tell you what. I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I'm not when we leave this room.
remember, first ice, then heat. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to call me.
thank you, Dr. House.
wait a second. Where's Cuddy?
gone for the day.
sorry. I can't remember if I've mocked you yet for being a male nurse.
I think this counts.
fair enough.
that isn't the man i married.
Yes, he is. He's just smarter. Give him some time.
I'm sure-- He hates me.
his body is going through withdrawal. He's adjusting.
maybe he never loved me. Not really.
maybe we never really had anything at all.
somebody help!
I can't feel my legs.
anywhere. Nothing.
we have to talk about this.
it's late. I'm tired.
I know it's a big pay cut, but I'll always have the chance to make money.
I won't always have the chance to do this job.
that's what you think? That it's about the money?
so it's that I didn't consult you before I took the job?
that was offensive, but it's not about that either.
so then...
can you give me the first letter?
when we got married, you were an intern working 30-hour shifts doing grunt work.
and we both put up with it because we knew that it was leading to something better.
in your private practice, you are the boss.
you call the shots, but now you're 40 years old, you're still doing grunt work.
that's what this is about? You think I'm a wuss?
he made you miss thanksgiving dinner.
vitamin b12 deficiency? Gives us anemia, numbness.
not a stroke.- If he has a vascular malformation
anemia's not macrocytic.
sorry to inconvenience you. Dying patients can be so thoughtless.
don't.
great comeback. Is that oscar wilde? Come on, people.
bone marrow malignancy. - Wouldn't produce schistocytes.
lupus. - Gee, thanks for coming in. Ana was negative.
what about you? Got any predictable drivel you'd like to add?
I think they've given you enough already.
well, at least they're trying. They're not just sitting there like roadkill.
give me something.
give me something, or I'll get your ex-smarter half on the phone and ask her.
you're gonna be pressing charges?
against the ottoman I tripped over?
against chase.
I'm pretty sure the ottoman was acting alone.
you free for dinner this weekend? - At least three other people saw him do it.
mass hysteria. Either night?
I can't have doctors punching each other out.
Oh, my god, who got punched?
and more importantly, for chase's sake, I need to know if he's able to handle himself or if iIshould be getting him some help.
chase couldn't have punched anyone. He was with me when I tripped over the ottoman.
if you're not planning on eating this weekend, maybe a movie?
I'm not doing this, House.
it's not fun anymore.
just do your job.
I need your help.
what happened to your face?
I was mowing the lawn when the phone rang.
you're a computer. I'm gonna feed you data, and you analyze it.
what, are you gonna feed me 20 years of medical knowledge too?
it's not gonna work.
I know.
but I don't have anyone else to ask.
it's lonely, isn't it?
it's not that bad.
then you're not that smart.
you ever tried to kill yourself?
not quickly. - I did.
12 years ago I jumped off the top of my eight-story building Into a dumpster bin the day before pickup.
I broke my collarbone, my leg, and three ribs.
when I was in the hospital they put me on narcotics and suddenly everything was just better.
I didn't feel isolated or lonely.
that's where I met my wife. She was so happy.
and dumb.
and I was... smart... and miserable.
you tell me who the genius is.
I fell in love with her buzzed out of my head, and I knew I wanted to stay that way forever.
enjoy.
easier on your conscience if I die an idiot?
what's a conscience?
which ribs... did you break in the fall? They on the left side?
Yeah, bottom three.
that was 12 years ago.
this probably cost me my marriage, so it better be awesome.
ferrous oxide contrast? Gets absorbed by the spleen.
unless he doesn't have one.
in which case it's absorbed by the liver, and fries that.
you're killing him? - You think I opened him up and didn't take out his spleen?
all organs do look kind of the same--red and squishy.
Oh, my god. - Accessory spleens.
okay, that is amazing.
12 years, eight stories, and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen.
bits of it split off, circulated through his bloodstream until they landed and attached somewhere else.
so it is ttp.
I just didn't remove... All of his spleens.
16 splenectomies.
pretty sure he gets a set of steak knives with that.
I can outrun you.
sorry about the nose. And the eye. and the, uh... eyebrow.
guess I deserved it.
well, if I thought that, I wouldn't be apologizing.
your fist slipped?
everybody kept bugging me, asking if I was okay.
so you busted my nose to keep people off your back.
pretty much.
making people even more worried about you. - Maybe.
but at least they're not talking to me about it.
fair enough.
Cheers.
thank you. - Don't be so grateful.
you'll be delivering packages for 70 years to pay for it.
well, uh, thanks for our talk.
it's been a while since I had a stimulating conversation.
so what're you gonna do? - Go back to my life.
which one?
the one that has my wife in it.
Robotripping. How's she feel about that?
well, she doesn't have to know.
it's worked for 12 years.
tell your brain I said good-bye.
einstein's giving himself a lobotomy, and you're cool with that?
ignorance is bliss.
hold that pose.
I'll start with t-shirts and mugs, and see how it goes.
home early.
what happened to him?
you beat up house? - Just one right hook.
Why? What happened?
you were right. I told him we need to lay down some ground rules, got a little heated.
that's not what I meant.
is he okay? Are you gonna be fired? Arrested?
everything's fine.
Dr. Cuddy.
can we at least be civil?
how's your nose?
it's okay.
does your kid like animals?
I got tickets to that holiday carnival. I hear they have a nice petting zoo.
I think I was pretty clear before.
I don't mean with me.
here. Take 'em. enjoy.
no, thanks.
they're not fake. I didn't steal them.
one of the nurses was selling 'em for her kid's scout trip.
I know it doesn't make things right between us, but I just wanted to do something nice.
I don't want them.
okay. - I'll see you tomorrow.
they didn't split up.
she wouldn't take the tickets.
of course. Windtalker code for "we never split up.
house, she told you multiple times she wants nothing to do with you.
I wasn't gonna be there.
she just felt guilty that I felt guilty, so she couldn't take them.
either that or she didn't want to appease you.
these weren't reparations.
just a simple gesture of remorse, and she slapped it down.
they didn't break up.
she just wanted me to think that so I'd back off.
dare I ask what you're gonna do?
nothing.
I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together. They didn't break up.
and you're okay with that?
it is what it is.
good for you.
house knows I lied.
Why? what'd he say?
nothing. I could just tell.
you want to stage another breakup? - No.
it seems like he's gonna leave us alone.
why would he do that?
I'm not completely sure.
so, we have his blessing?
I guess so.
maybe House isn't so bad after all.
that would be nice, wouldn't it?
my lords, and ladies.
today your queen will choose her champion.
here, he will battle for not only her honor, but for a title of his own.
but only if he can defeat the Captain of my guard, Sir Horace the Black!
sir William... Wouldst thou fight for my honor?
to the death, Your Majesty.
let's hope it does not come to that, eh?
I choose Sir William as my champion.
attack from his left side.
I saw his squire bandaging that shoulder this morning.
I wish thee luck and strength.
I fear I shall need all I can get.
the Captain of my guard, Sir Horace the Black!
are you sure you wouldn't like to reconsider your choice, my queen?
I believe I chose rightly, my king.
brave knights, in the honored tradition of our lands, have at ye!
I fear you chose most poorly, my love.
what is it?
your eyes.
we need an ambulance at the Camden Fairgrounds.
you're new.
you're naked.
and, for the record, a little bit cold.
I'm sorry, I didn't know that anyone was home.
James had an early call, and I was just leaving.
without breakfast?
I'm fine, thanks. I'm Sam, by the way.
house. Nice to meet you.
it'd be nicer if you'd put this on.
so you and Wilson... -- Thought you were staying in New York last night.
sorry, must have missed the "if this trailer be a-rockin'" sign out front.
I'm really late, so if there's any chance that we can pretend this never happened,
I'd be completely fine with that.
an eight-year-old with bleeding ears.
I'll see your bleeding ears and raise you a total muscular degeneration.
what the hell?
I had a dream like this once. It didn't end well.
Huzzah, my loyal peasants!
house, what are you doing?
filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl at the Goldstein Bris.
while I'm busy, you all can check out the Knight down in the E. R. who, instead of seizing the throne, just seized.
he works at a Renaissance Festival?
doesn't work there, he lives there as part of a wonderful little troupe, who spend their weekends reenacting a nobler age, when people crapped in the streets, and thirteen would have been a grandmother.
weeks, not weekends. Says here he's been camping out for a month.
try doing that with a pen.
why don't you put that down before you kill one of us?
better idea, why don't you give me something I can use so I won't feel the need to?
seizure right after a fight obviously suggests concussion.
obviously it isn't, or the E. R. wouldn't have called House.
a full set of armor would protect againt visible trauma, but not transmitted concussive force.
could be a subdural hematoma.
you're forgetting to demonize.
an evil, satanic subdural hematoma.
no. Two demon eyes.
hemorrhaging in the sclerae.
could be an allergic reaction to something from the Renaissance Fair.
which is why we need to check out middle earth.
Foreman, take Frodo and break bread with the Hobbits.
I still think a hematoma is more likely.
that's why you and Chase are gonna get an MRI.
but you just-- I said Frodo, not Gollum.
is he saying I have short legs or hairy feet?
I don't even know who Frodo is.
who's the chick, and why are you hiding her?
you were home last night?
and this morning.
I bumped into your babe, naked.
I told you to stay out of my bathroom.
I was in the kitchen. --She was naked in the kitchen?
I was naked. --Why the hell were you naked in the kitchen?
uh, it's not important right now. What is, is why you didn't want me to meet her in the first place.
is she married? --No.
a patient? -- I don't have time for this.
she used to be a man. -- House!
she wants to be a man.
Sam --it's a man's name, short for...
Samantha.
the soulless harpy you were married to before we met.
people change, House.
sure.
they get older, ovaries start drying up, and nice guys like you look attractive again.
listen, I know that, in your own demented way, you think you're looking out for me. But I have this.
by this, you mean a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach.
fine. I get it.
it's your life. You go screw it up. I can wait.
for what?
to tell you,"I told you so."
no signs of hematoma.
brain looks completely normal.
normal, except for the fact that he likes to play dress-up.
my uncle used to pretend he was King Leopold.
I'm not pretending.
um, sorry about that.
you don't really think you're a Knight, do you?
being a Knight isn't a game.
it's a lifestyle, and we do it every day, not just when we play dress-up.
we live by a code and uphold ideals like loyalty, courage, humility.
and the part where you beat the crap out of each other in armor?
that we do for fun.
at least it was up until yesterday.
are--are we almost done?'Cause I'm feeling
let's get him out of there before he aspirates.
anything abnormal on the MRI?
God's teeth, what strange manner of garments be these?
okay, we'll be back soon.
he consorts with tiny demons in his hand.
tis witchcraft, I say!
do I look like I'm here to play pretend with you?
relax, it's not personal.
just tell them you're a time traveler or something.
well, if we're gonna be here, we might as well enjoy it.
our Knight just vomited inside the MRI.
Taub thinks it might be food poisoning...
which shouldn't be surprising
outdoor latrines, food prep going on next to livestock.
I hear you wish to speak with me, concerning Sir William.
how faireth he?
not well, or we wouldn't be here.
a pox indeed is-- Miles.
we just thought it was a concussion.
he's gonna be okay, right?
we need to look at the area he was camping out in.
and you might want to invest into a dental plan for the kingdom.
you sure he got sick from something here?
we're not sure of anything yet, but...
what do you make of this?
Hmm... looks like vomit.
means he was showing symptoms prior to the fight.
true, but I meant this.
Oh, it's a cow eye.
from the night before the tournament.
he makes the Knights eat all kinds of disgusting stuff.
Why? -- He got the idea from Fear Factor.
why didn't he mention it when he checked into the hospital?
I make them all take an oath of secrecy about the ritual.
william tends to take his role as a Knight very seriously.
do you think that's what caused him to pass out?
that's not exactly sanitary.
fun stuff never is.
serious bacterial food poisoning explains seizure and vomiting.
a lumbar puncture could confirm.
except it's not food poisoning.
if it was, the E. R. would look like Camelot right now.
all it takes is one bad eyeball.
or testicle, cow brain, or my personal favorite, pig rectum, with a side order of sphincter.
I think they call that breakfast in Australia.
no one else was sick, because they weren't allergic like he was.
to what? -- That's what I sent you to middle earth to find out.
run scratch tests for the samples you brought back.
that's gonna take time, and he's getting worse.
so treat him with epinephrine too.
this should prevent any more symptoms until we can figure out what it is you're allergic to.
Thanks.
told you you shouldn't have eaten all that stuff.
you know, you don't have to stay. I'm sure you and Miles are crazy busy, what with the wedding and all.
miles said we could postpone it until-- Don't worry. I'll be fine.
I'll be there.
I just hope you have a good photographer, 'cause I don't think the standard red-eye filter is gonna work on these.
I need your right arm.
that, uh... Feels-- feels strange.
what is it? What's wrong?
his heart rate's become irregular.
my--my chest hurts. It feels like it's gonna explode.
Tachycardia--we need to shock him back into rhythm.
Oh, my God, William.
I need his gown open.
what is-- what is that stuff?
I don't know.
it's definitely not an allergy, or the eppy would have helped him, not made him worse.
unless he's allergic and allergic to the cure.
sodium bisulfite-- the preservative that keeps eppy peppy-- can cause tachycardia.
so can wolff-parkinson-white syndrome, and it also causes hemorrhaging in the eyes.
and abnormal electrical pathways in the heart, which could cause seizures.
but not skin infections.
there is an infection that can cause skin and neurological damage and spreads rapidly without treatment.
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus?
lord have MRSA.
you weren't wearing gloves when we shocked his heart back into rhythm.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
you two get a sample to the lab to confirm, you get the Knight into isolation and on I. V. antibiotics.
you... stay away from me.
need to talk. -- About the MRSA?
I know, we're-- MRSA, shmrsa. Something important.
something you think is more important than the potentially lethal bacteria spreading like wildfire through my hospital?
well, that narrows it down to something personal and stupid.
Wilson. -- Theory confirmed.
he is dating his first wife. I know.
I don't believe it.
that he didn't ask your permission first?
no, that he's actually capable of keeping a secret from me.
well, you'd be surprised how many things Wilson doesn't tell you.
would I? Like
like how you slept with your father's best friend or...
I'm gonna kill him.
you need to break them up.
forget it.
so you'd rather sit back and watch while the evil blonde gorges on Wilson's tender flesh and then tosses out his bones like she did the last time?
you remember what he was like after that?
Yes, I do.
well, then do something.
God knows he's not gonna listen to me.
you, on the other hand, have decades of experience dating and being attracted to losers.
obviously, I don't include myself.
you know what happens when you interfere in other people's relationships?
of course. I do it all the time.
hmm, I see your point.
that is why I'm staying out of this.
you force him to choose, you might not like the answer.
he doesn't seem to be in as much pain anymore.
that's good, but we won't be out of the woods for sure until the blisters start to recede.
Hey, I'm really thirsty.
you mind getting me a soda?
sure, I'll be right back.
what's wrong?
the pain in my chest, it's getting worse.
just now?
no, I didn't want to worry her.
so how long have you been in love with her?
what? No, we're just friends.
seriously.
since the first time I saw her.
why don't you tell her?
she's engaged to my friend.
the King? Haven't seen him visiting or sitting by your bedside.
he has responsibilities.
Yeah. I'm guessing the Queen does too.
what kind of Knight steals his friend's bride?
I hate that I even think about it.
you're not a Knight.
you're just a guy.
but I want to be more than that.
your chest?
no, my--my back.
feels like there's a knife in it.
is the infection spreading?
it's not mrsa.
it looks like some sort of clostridial organism.
question is, which type of clostridium? There's hundreds.
C. Perfringens?
wouldn't account for his other symptoms.
C. Tetani, on the other hand... Tetanus, he--he would have been inoculated against it.
so he cut himself and didn't get a booster shot.
the guy fights people with swords for fun. No one said he's smart.
they don't just fight for fun. They fight to prove their bravery.
you're buying this honor stuff?
fighting's not brave. It's just stupid.
you would say that.
you think I've never been in a fight? -- No, I just think you've never won one.
I took on three guys in college once.
hope they bought you dinner first.
it's not mrsa.
I know, it's poison Ivy. -- Poison Ivy?
a severe reaction could cause the blisters and maybe irritate his eyes enough to cause the hemorrhaging, but the chest pain and seizures...
they have bonfires every night.
the burning leaves aerosolizes the oil.
we've seen what it's done to the outside of his body. Imagine what it's doing to his lungs and his sinuses.
okay, maybe it remotely fits, but I'd rather go with scientific evidence than with your gut.
how about this?
apparently, it's all over his sword.
it's his heart rate again. -- How fast is it?
it's slowing, why aren't you-- It's not MRSA.
I'm giving him 12 ccs epinephrine.
he tested positive. You'll blow his heart out!
if it slows any more, it's gonna stop.
I told you.
and I told you.
that wasn't caused by poison Ivy.
or epinephrine. That means the heart problem we ruled out, we now have to rule back in.
we found clostridium bacteria in the skin samples.
Clostridium's in dirt and basically harmless.
but opportunistic, if his immune system is depressed.
leukemia?
he would have had symptoms way before the Renaissance Festival.
which is true of anything that would compromise his immune system, which means it has to be some other environmental toxin.
yesterday he was a healthy Knight, today he's sleeping beauty.
nothing else fits.
trichinosis from eating infected meat?
we already ruled out food poisoning. Both the butcher shop and the food stands at the fair were totally clean.
then he ate the poison apple somewhere else.
or maybe you just missed it.
start treatment for trichinosis and confirm with a muscle biopsy.
I can't believe I'm about to say this.
Sam-- Told you so.
no, she didn't dump me. She wants to get to know you better.
damn it. I never should have let her see me naked.
it goes against all my instincts, but I said all right.
Why?
she thinks I was hiding her from you.
you were.
I don't want her to know.
so you're asking me to condone a relationship based on lies and mistrust.
Yeah.
when and where?
tonight, Venezia, 8:00.
what am I gonna wear? All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.
house, listen.
I know you're worried about me, and I also know that that kind of unselfishness doesn't come naturally to you.
but I don't want your help. I don't need your help.
just come to dinner and be your usual selfish self.
how could I say no?
miles said he'd stop by later.
no, tell him not to.
I don't want to be seen like this.
you're sick. That's nothing to be ashamed of...
Un-unless you're saying you want me to leave.
no, don't.
I think he's saying it's different with you, Shannon.
it's a guy thing--they don't like showing weakness in front of each other. Right, William?
right. Maybe when I'm feeling a little better.
I'm gonna take a small sample of your muscle tissue here.
do you mind waiting outside for this?
don't hurt him. -- He's safe with me.
I thought you were gonna tell her.
it's not my call, but if you ask me, she's waiting for you to.
knights are supposed to be selfless.
right, they conquered countries and built Castles by being selfless.
bravery and loyalty are great qualities for soldiers.
if you want to be King, sometimes you have to be willing to take what's yours.
she's not mine.
she's not his either... Not yet.
it's just dinner. Relax.
trust me, there is no "just" when House is involved.
we're in the middle of a restaurant.
what could he possibly... Do?
that.
sorry we're late. But you know girls.
always fiddling with the hair and the makeup.
James, Sam...this is Sarah.
it's nice to meet you.
horace has told me all-- House.
house... has told me all about you.
it's nice to meet you.
what's the diagnosis?
his muscle biopsy is clean.
it's not trichinosis.
house was wrong, this is not environmental.
or we screwed up and missed something at the Renaissance Fair.
you think we did?
no, but I think House will think we did.
what could we have missed?
fungal infection?
there's nothing in his blood work even remotely suggesting that.
what if it's his symptoms?
you wanna re-test every sample we took for spores?
we'll be here all night.
have you noticed how much pain he's been in lately?
and that's relevant how?
extra pain means extra cranky, it means off his game.
he's not gonna accept this isn't environmental unless we give him no choice.
I cannot believe you're from Bloomington.
I know, isn't it amazing?
Yeah, delightful.
ignore him. He's just upset that we're having fun.
do you remember that little bakery, the one with the amazing cupcakes?
Gino's. -- Oh, yes!
first stop, every time I go home.
Oh, me too...Mmm!
remember that strip club?
girl, I used to work at that strip club.
where does it hurt, William? -- My legs, it feels like they're on fire!
rhabdomyolysis means his kidneys are failing.
also means it's not environmental. We need to move on.
I recommend we start with a full cancer workup, starting with the
which one of you checked out the apartment?
house... His symptoms fit an environmental
the test results don't, we redid-- search the apartment.
he hasn't been there in three weeks-- go! Now!
I liked him better when he was on Vicodin.
you and thirteen check out his place.
while you're wasting your time, we'll ultrasound the liver.
if it's cancer, it's as good a place as any to start.
I hear House met Sam.
first time, he was naked. The second time he brought a transvestite prostitute to dinner.
overall, it could have been worse. -- Great.
that's your reaction?
what? --Nudity, prostitute...
sorry, preoccupied.
house said something to you, didn't he?
Nope. He didn't.
it is a little crazy, though.
I mean... isn't it?
I mean... things seem to be going great.
but they seemed to be going great 12 years ago.
the good things are still good.
she's still smart, funny, gets me.
and she's less competitive. Either she's changed, or I've changed. But, either way...
am I out of my mind?
you never know what can happen.
you might as well give it a chance.
Yeah.
looks like you were right.
tumors... dozens of them. Inside, and on the surface.
pull in closer.
see that?
what is that?
I don't know. But it's definitely not cancer.
kitchen's clean.
bedroom as well.
most dangerous thing in his medicine cabinet was dental floss.
it's locked, key wasn't on his ring.
do you honestly want to go back and tell House we didn't check every square inch of this place?
of course not.
my hero.
what the hell is this?
either a secret entrance to Hogwarts, or...
our Knight... is a witch.
our Knight is into some seriously creepy stuff.
he claims it's just sugar water but we sent the rest down to the lab for testing.
do you think he poisoned himself?
it's not poison, we would have picked it up in his blood work.
not if it collected slowly in his liver and it all started leaking into his system at once.
these tumors that aren't tumors, what if they're focal hepatic lesions filled with blood?
every time one explodes it'd be releasing another dose.
of what?
you putting a hex on someone?
it's latin, for black lead.
our Knight/Warlock apparently also dabbles in alchemy.
lead poisoning.
seizures, paralysis, weak immune system, and eventually, coma.
biopsy the cysts, and you'll find your lead.
you think we'll make the 7: 30?
I'm sorry, if I don't change, I'm gonna feel like I'm at work all night.
Yeah, I remember.
is it a problem?
not at all.
in fact, if we hurry
we will definitely not make the 7: 30.
well, there's always the 9: 40.
or not.
shouldn't you be at the hospital?
wouldn't need a team if I did all the work, now, would I? Plus, I had to make you dinner.
we have plans.
I bet your plans don't taste like this.
don't!
house, whatever it is that you're up to
I'm trying to be nice.
what I did the other night was juvenile. I'm sorry.
Yeah.
the souffle was amazing.
it's my mom's recipe. Everything else, I got off the Web.
here's to the Internet.
where I found the lamb ragout, and you two found each other... Again.
well, it wasn't just the Internet.
Yeah, more like divorce, depression, therapy, more therapy, and the Internet.
and here we are. -- Exactly.
and here we are.
well, I need to go to the bathroom.
I think you're old enough, now.
but if you would like me to come along with you...
I mean, is it safe to leave the two of you?
come on, James. Enough, already.
Yeah, James, I cook in peace.
okay. I'll be right back.
you're a cold-hearted bitch, who ripped his heart out.
I watched him struggle for years to overcome the damage you did.
and there's no way I'm going to just let you wheel him back in so you can do it all over again.
and all this?
phase two of getting to know my enemy.
you're wrong about me.
but I'm glad now I don't have to pretend to like you, except for when James is standing next to me.
same here.
only difference is, I'll outlast you.
and scene.
well, it's too late for the movie. Wanna see what's on tv?
Absolutely. -- Love to.
there wasn't any lead present in his blood work or liver biopsy.
and his heart rate and bp are getting even more erratic.
we had to shock it back into rhythm twice during the night.
there's only one thing left to do.
we're wasting our time.
actually, I've already gotten good value.
I told you, there's nothing here that could have caused any of his symptoms.
no, you told me that you couldn't find anything here that could be causing the symptoms.
and now we're gonna find something new because we're in costume?
we looked everywhere, tested everything.
just because Wilson's acting stupid doesn't mean we are.
do you think he's making a mistake?
of course. But he'll figure it out, sooner or later.
hopefully after a few weeks of great sex. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Wilson's not like us.
he cares too much about people and their feelings. - Thanks for the compliment.
the code that our Knight claims to live by, all that crap about honor and chivalry.
Wilson's naturally like that, which is why he's-- A great guy.
a sucker and a target. So we gotta look out for him.
do you smell that?
Yeah, it's the apothecary shop. And yes, Foreman and I already...
I cry your pardon, sir.
you know what this is?
well, that's lavender. --Try rose hips.
both harmless, who cares?
it could be cyanide as far as he knows.
how about this?
it be nothing but St. John's Wort.
wrong again. Black cohash.
my uncle owns the shop, I just started apprenticing. What the big deal?
I just organized all that.
you know what this is?
a wild carrot?
it's hemlock, you embossed carbuncle.
that's hemlock? You sure?
did you sell it to anyone?
it's poison, think hard.
it was just one branch.
you sold it to Sir William?
no. To the King.
it's the only part of the environment you didn't check.
the people living in it.
what's going on?
why can't we see William?
because you poisoned him. Your royal anus.
with this.
wild carrots?
hemlock.
I need to know how much you used and how you prepared it.
you did something to William? -- No, of course not!
he's still alive. You want to avoid a murder charge, start talking fast.
the apothecary's willing to testify that you're the only one he gave it to.
okay, yeah, maybe I bought it for the food challenge, but I didn't know that was hemlock.
if it was for the challenge, then why is wee Willie the only Knight who's dying?
I don't know! I'm telling you, I didn't know.
why would I want to hurt William?
I can think of at least one reason.
miles, please.
whatever happened, just tell them the truth.
I am! I swear.
we ran a gas chromatography on his blood.
found trace amounts of piperidine alkaloids.
the main markers of hemlock intoxication.
well, the good news is we now know what's wrong with you.
the bad news is that your King's precious ideals were just pretend after all.
at least, when it comes to guys who get too close to his Queen.
it's not true.
I guess you've never heard the expression,"gas chromatography machines don't lie.
neither does Miles.
he's the best Knight I've ever known.
it's why he was chosen King.
miles is a jealous idiot.
and you're just an idiot.
uh, something's wrong.
we performed a gastric lavage and administered activated charcoal, but he's getting worse, not better.
well, it's been in his system two days.
we're lucky he's lasted this long.
if it was hemlock, he'd either be dead already or getting better with treatment.
it's hemlock, we found it in his blood.
he may have had some hemlock, but it's not what's killing him.
don't do it!
whatever you're planning, especially if you're gonna use that thing.
geez. It was just sitting in a stone.
here.
it's gonna cost extra, because of the level of detail that you wanted.
anything good?
and by good, I,of course, mean bad.
Nope, pretty much your typical life. Married young, got divorced.
married a little less young, got divorced.
she's been pretty successful in everything she's done, except marriage.
well, there's gotta be something I can use.
maybe. Didn't read her shrink's notes. Didn't seem right.
but stealing them did.
whoa, I didn't steal them. I found a way to obtain them.
excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but you got a minute?
sure.
Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.
careful. I have a sword.
I don't agree with what you said.
but I understand why you said it.
we were married young, we both made mistakes, and yes, I did make most of them.
but that was almost a decade ago.
I'm sorry, is that the statutory period for soul sucking?
I'm not asking you to like me, House.
to be honest, I think you're an ass. But we do have one thing in common.
we care about James.
so prove it. And dump him... again.
you're pretty much insufferable all the time, aren't you?
sorry, go on. And, yes.
we just reconnected, we have no idea where we're headed.
but is it really too much to ask that you give us a chance to find out?
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.
we did it.
well, I did it.
what exactly did we do?
you do?
these aren't focal hepatic lesions on his liver, they're peliosis hepitus lesions.
which in combination with an erratic heart rate, usually indicates endocarditis. Infection on his heart valve.
two major symptoms of anabolic steroid abuse.
no, he wouldn't. -- And the rhabdo makes the third.
our patient's a juicer.
ancient poison accelerated the damage of the modern poison.
start treatment, let the King out of the tower.
how are you feeling?
ashamed.
you should be.
you'll compromise your ideals to win a fight, but not to go for the woman you love.
that was a game. Not real life.
I didn't-- Hurt anyone?
try telling that to Shannon.
or maybe I missed something while she was crying by your bed.
you don't need to win anyone's heart.
you just need to ask for it.
miles is a great guy.
he's rich, smart, treats her well. She's gonna have a great life with him.
but me?
well, I'd do everything I could for her, but even at my best, it wouldn't be much.
and she deserves the best.
I guess I'd rather she be happy even if it means I'm not.
I guess House was right about that, too.
what?
you really are an idiot.
who is it?
Tom, your husband?
what's he doing here?
uh, what's going on?
I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be here, but Evelyn's school contract's due tomorrow.
I knew I was forgetting something.
let me, uh, find a pen.
not quite sure what Emily post recommends in this situation, but I'm Tom.
Damien. Hey.
sorry to intrude. I just
I wasn't quite sure when she'd be coming home.
no problem.
thank you so much for catching this.
Yeah.
well, I'll get out of your way, it was good to meet you, and I'll see you later, honey.
Bye.
so...
seems like a nice guy.
Jules, you okay?
no, my stomach.
here. Lie down.
try to-- - get Tom.
you know what would be perfect?
french toast tower.
you still go to Mickey's?
what's your cholesterol?
it's my one vice. I'm keeping it.
as much as I would love to clog my arteries,
I have a 10: 00 ct and I still have to race home, get changed.
maybe you could keep some clothes here.
maybe I could.
he's just trying to get into your skirts.
and I don't mean metaphorically.
well, he's got the legs for it.
so I will see you tonight?
Yeah.
Bye, House.
have a nice day.
have a nice day. How civilized.
I said I'd stay t of it.
what? - Nothing.
clearly something. - Nope.
house, on a list of your attributes, there's nothing that even rhymes with "coy.
okay, I may have seen something in the fridge.
like the end of your relationship.
she put the milk in the door and not on the shelf.
it's not a big deal.
you hate that she did that, but you didn't say anything.
you're trying to get us to fight.
no, I'm trying to help.
if you got an issue, let her know.
I should have known that you weren't done sabotaging this.
fine. Stew in your irritation.
and sure, last time it bubbled over into resentment and rage, leading ultimately to a painful divorce that neither of you ever really recovered from, but I'm sure this time it'll be great.
interesting case. 35-year-old woman with fever and abdominal pain.
E. R. ruled out all the usual suspects.
stop before you interest me to death.
and she's in an open marriage.
that's not interesting. It's just weird.
know what's weirder? That other humans are monogamous in the first place.
no other species on the planet mates for life and if you're gonna bring up swans, they cheat like everybody else.
they just have better pr than rabbits.
animals also eat their young and kill their rivals.
that make it weird that most of us don't?
says the guy whose opposable thumbs have been all over how many women who aren't his wife?
a functional open marriage is like a Unicorn.
it's a mythical creature that doesn't exist.
someone always ends up unhappy.
our patient's unhappy because she's suffering from an intestinal blockage.
boring.
then we have to find a reason to rule it out.
what about herpes colitis?
she picks up the infection from one of her partners.
it takes root in her colon. - Std panel was clean.
chances are, this couple was unhappy in the first place.
this is their attempt to save something that never go on.
herpes might not register if she was exposed in the last six weeks.
but it would show up on a barium enema.
wait. You're gonna do it?
gotta see if our patient's a Unicorn or just a slutty horse.
think how much fun Taub could be having.
barium coats the inner lining of your colon.
lets us get a good look at it on the X-ray.
I can get somebody else to pick up Evelyn.
I feel like I'm abandoning you.
I'm on painkillers.
I'd rather this not be what you think of every time you look at my butt.
okay, roll onto your side.
it's fill 'er up time.
so is Evelyn his new squeeze?
she's our daughter.
must be interesting growing up in a production of Oh! Calcutta!
she's six.
she knows as much about our sex life as any other kid her age.
you can explain that she's the reason the two of you stayed married.
you've been in the room five minutes. You got us all figured out.
of course, you left out the part where we love each other and we want to grow old together.
but you just don't want to be young together.
look, when you think about it, tons of couples do what we do.
it's just that with most of them, one spouse doesn't know about it.
we decided things work better when people tell each other the truth.
tank's full.
I'll page the radiology elves.
I'm not saying I hate it.
just doesn't go with your eyes.
you hate it. - Little bit.
any more heartless critiques of my general appearance?
Nope. All done.
so is she as bendy as she looks?
Maya and I are just friends.
no, you and I are friends and you don't have coffee with me three times a week.
she's an interesting person.
she grew up in Ohio. She has three brothers.
fascinating. Last week, that Cambodian lab tech was telling us how he survived the Killing Fields and you left to go get a donut.
so we flirt. It's fun.
it's dangerous. That woman would totally do you.
you think?
nothing is gonna happen.
all I'm saying is if you want to be on a diet, you might want to stop hanging out by the dessert cart.
x-ray was clean. She doesn't have herpes colitis or abdominal pain.
it stopped hurting during the X-ray, which means it was just an intestinal blockage that passed. We should discharge her.
Absolutely.
there's no need to find any underlying cause 'cause these things never happen twice.
take her digestive system for a test drive.
give her a radio-opaque milkshake.
x-ray every 15 minutes to see if it makes any unscheduled stops on the way through.
we'll be here all night.
no, Taub will be here all night.
talk to the Unicorn and then tell me you don't believe.
I did an abdominal ct on a kid today and found a six-inch bezoar made entirely of gum.
I mean, who gives a three-year-old an endless supply of g
you okay? - Yeah.
I mean, there was hair in it and maybe a piece of paper.
so... how long you been married?
one of the few drawbacks of having an open marriage.
nobody ever asks me about current events or the weather.
Yankees look good this season.
seven years.
and, uh, how long have you-- you know?
after three years, we realized that traditional marriage was making us both miserable.
most people get divorced at that point.
Yeah, we didn't want to get divorced. We still loved each other.
we just realized that expecting one person to fulfill all of your needs forever is unrealistic.
there are happy monogamous couples out there.
sure. One or two have the perfect marriage.
everybody else has figured out how to settle for less.
I don't want to settle and end up resenting my husband.
I'd rather g the 10% he doesn't give me somewhere else so that i can really appreciate him for the 90% he does.
I think something's wrong.
with your stomach? - My heart is racing.
try and take deep breaths.
I'm going to try to slow your heart down.
is this because of the blockage?
no. It's not working.
need a crash cart in here!
I need a list of all your sexual partners from the last six months.
Why?
your wife had an arrhythmia.
the progression of symptoms from bowel to heart makes a parasitic infection most likely.
since Julia hasn't been out of the country
the only place that I've been recently is a business trip to Nebraska.
but either of you could have picked up a bug from one of your partners.
it's kind of... complicated.
how many partners are we talking about? Ballpark.
none. - None?
we have a great sex life.
I don't need anyone else.
so why not just tell her that and close this whole thing up?
you married? - I-- I was.
did you ever agree to go see a chick flick with your wife or pretend to enjoy classical music?
Stravinsky never groped my wife in a Midtown hotel room.
she needs this.
I don't.
but I don't want her to feel bad about that.
he's lying.
guy's got a license to drill. Why would he lie about not using it?
that's not the lie.
the lie is that he gives a crap about how his wife feels.
if they're both screwing around, that's one thing.
but if she has a piece on the side and he doesn't, the only way he'd be okay with that is if he's betraying her in some other way that, in his mind, makes them even.
my Unicorn isn't a Unicorn.
it's a donkey with a plunger stuck to its face.
right. Even the guy who's not cheating is doing it for underhanded reasons.
no, no, no. He's not being cynical.
he's assuming the husband is doing something to even the score, which means he thinks there is a score, which means, cheating swans aside, House believes in monogamy.
he's being romantic.
what I believe is that men are genetically engineered to be jealous.
doesn't matter if i think there's a score. I guarantee you he does.
any of the wife's partners pan out?
she's been with two people other than Tom in the last six months.
neither of them have been outside the tri-state area.
so we're back to the husband.
you just said you believed-- - he's doing something behind her back.
what better cover than a business trip to Nebraska?
like that's really a place.
let's find his travel records and get back to work.
you seem pretty mellow about this couple's deal.
thought you'd be first in line to shake a finger.
they're still married. I'm not.
not that I could ever do it.
I was jealous of House and Cameron never touched him.
not counting the emotional fondling.
when my mom was dying, my dad had an affair.
he told you this?
I'd seen them get out of his car.
two years after mom died, they got married.
that must have sucked.
at the time, yeah.
but looking back... It makes sense.
my mom never knew about it and he needed someone to make him feel less alone.
he took care of my mom day in and day out for 2 1/2 years before she died.
he was devoted to her.
loving someone else didn't change that.
so loving two people at once is fine as long as one of them is dying?
whoever's taking care of me when I get sick,
I hope they've got someone else to take care of them.
Tom was telling the truth.
he really did go to Nebraska.
plane ticket and restaurant seats.
forget Nebraska.
maybe they just bought their parasites at the mall.
you know, we should really throw away that loofah.
they're imported. Sometimes they're not sterilized.
we think our patient got amoebiasis from hers.
is she gonna be okay?
we're treating now. She should be fine.
it's actually kind of bizarre.
she and her husband have an open marriage.
they sleep with other people?
well, she does. Her husband's totally fine with it.
I mean, it's crazy, right?
and you're bringing this up because?
I thought it was interesting.
more interesting than your other cases, I guess.
I mean, you talk about your colleagues, you rant about House.
you don't usually mention your patients.
is open marriage something you want?
no.
I mean...
I know you'd never...
all this time and energy you spent convincing me you weren't cheating...
and there's somebody else.
I'm not-- - some more water sir?
okay.
there's a woman at work.
people say she's attracted to me, but nothing's happened.
nothing's going to happen. I'm not having an affair.
but you want to.
no, honey.
I'm trying to be honest.
I don't want to make the same mistakes.
be honest then.
are you attracted to her?
listen...
she's attractive.
there's an attraction.
aren't there men who make you feel that way?
of course there are, but it never occurs to me to act on it because
because I'm married... To you.
and that's enough for me.
aren't I enough for you?
of course you are.
our patient's lost all movement in her legs.
there are other doctors, Chris. We're talking.
I'm sorry.
the woman's paralyzed.
I'll get a cab.
tests show no spinal cord injury, no cerebral lesions, no hemorrhage.
finally got a stool sample. The loofah's innocent.
no sign of amoebas or any other parasites.
so paralysis, arrhythmia, and intermittent abdominal pain.
and he nicked himself shaving.
sorry. That was Taub.
but it was easier to solve.
means he used the crappy razor in his locker, which means he slept here.
thanks to you.
I brought up open marriage with Rachel.
it was a disaster.
on the medical front, we've knocked out sex and foreign travel.
could be an electrolyte imbalance.
so the only time you're not interested in my marriage is after you bw it up?
you're the moron who took marital advice from Tila Tequila.
you pushed me into this.
figured it would either blow up your marriage or make it more honest.
either way, you win. What about sex?
I'm talking about the patient. Is that cool with everybody?
we've ruled out sex.
we ruled out sex with other people.
Tom said he and Julia have been doing it three or four times a week and she's got boys on the side.
increased libido can be a symptom of adrenocortical carcinoma, which also explains her other symptoms.
a woman who likes sex must be sick?
just because everybody in this room wishes that all women were horny all the time doesn't make it so.
get an mri of her adrenal glands.
okay if I take the sports page?
sure.
would you mind using a coaster?
Oh. Sure. Sorry.
it's okay.
also, it'd be great if you'd replace the toilet paper when you finish a roll.
and when you load the dishwasher, you can't put a big, flat bowl on the bottom.
it traps the water so nothing on the top gets clean.
and please don't throw banana peels in the bedroom trash.
I haven't done any of those things.
you're probably not even aware of I hate bananas.
Oh, my God. It was House.
I'm sorry. He's been trying to get us to fight.
why would he think that stuff would make us fight?
because of the milk.
you put it in the door.
the body of the refrigerator is the coldest part.
the temperature in the door fluctuates, which decreases shelf life.
when did you get all ocd?
I just want clean dishes and unspoiled milk so we can all stay healthy.
Oh, it's about health.
what about the coaster? Does that replenish my B-12 or something?
can we just drop it? - Sure.
you have this list of annoyances the entire time we were married?
get better, mommy.
I love you, rabbit.
Julia, you have a guest.
this isn't a good time.
Dr. Hadley, did you say there was a video game in the playroom?
maybe you can teach me how to play one of them.
see you in radiology.
get out of my wife's room.
your relationship with her stays out of our space.
I was worried about her.
Tom's right. You should go.
so it's fine if we have sex, but if I drop by to see if you're okay
this is our family.
sorry.
I spent two years of residency wearing shirts that were a size too small.
how hard is it to ask me not to put them in the dryer?
and I only did your laundry because you were never home.
I didn't ask you to. - Of course you didn't.
you just got annoyed whenever you didn't have clean underwear.
I never said I was annoyed.
that's the point. You didn't say anything.
so I'm getting a lecture on communication from someone who had her lawyer inform me our marriage was over.
asking for an open marriage. You got stones.
conversation sort of got away from me. It was a train wreck.
I think it's good you brought it up.
I read a study that found men who have multiple copies of a certain vasopressin receptor are twice as likely to be unfaithful.
maybe you're just one of those guys.
so my cheating is biologically predetermined? Fantastic.
multiply times five. We need a better look at the medulla.
I thought you'd be relieved.
this gets you off the hook. It's just genetics.
I'm 56 and have a receding hairline.
I hate genetics. Medulla's clean.
I don't see you wearing lifts or hair plugs.
that's because being short and bald doesn't hurt anybody.
the only thing hurtful about your other genetic predisposition is that you keep denying it.
it's not good for you or Rachel.
there's nothing there. It's not adrenal cancer.
and maybe you're right about me.
but I'm not gonna stop trying. Rachel's worth it.
look up there.
the lung. What is that?
you served me with divorce papers in the middle of a medical conference in New Orleans.
I threw a bottle into an antique mirror.
Oh, you exhibited an emotion? I wish I'd known you were capable.
I loved you. I thought I was gonna be following you to Baltimore, remember?
I called about apartments. I set up interviews.
how could you think that we still had a real marriage?
we hadn't had a conversation in months.
maybe because I was working two jobs to support us.
No! No! It's because when you were home, it was like talking to a block of ice.
you were obviously so pissed off at me.
I was killing myself so that you could take that non-paying internship.
that you said that I should take.
I was trying to be supportive! Why do I have to be the bad guy?
expressing yourself does not make you the bad guy.
okay, then. You were being a selfish bitch.
VQ scan confirmed the spot on Julia's lung was a clot.
think there's a chance the husband's a plushie?
if he has a secret, I highly doubt it's more relevant than the clot.
clotting disorder would explain everything.
question is, which one?
do you read any of your departmental memos?
only the ones labeled,"n-s-f-w."
accounting notified you two days ago about your patient's insurance.
sorry, that's "n-n-s-f-w.
here.
he doesn't have any. Try not to bankrupt them.
Oh, I'm long past the number of procedures that'll bankrupt them.
Julia's got insurance. I saw the policy number on the form.
but the policy lapsed due to non-payment.
I already made three calls about this. You should have been aware of that.
no, there's just a mistake. Of course we have health insurance.
we're actually a little behind on the premiums.
but I pulled money out of my retirementccount to cover it.
they said that we'll be fine in
why the retirement account?
we'll just give you a few minutes to
and by "we," she means "she."
I lost all of our savings.
sounds like a secret to me.
I started her on heparin to prevent further clots, but we still don't know what's going on.
of course the husband's secret was money.
if it's not sex, it's always money.
unless it's sex for money.
how did he lose it anyway?
it's not medically relevant. You're not gonna care.
Wilson's been teaching me how to care. Try me.
he builds wind turbines and leases them out to local power companies.
you're right. I don't care.
clotting disorder: Dic. Factor five leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome.
vitamin k deficiency also fits.
causes thrombophilia and is consistent with abdominal pain.
congratulations, House. Sam ended it.
what happened?
go test our patient's blood.
but it can wait five minutes.
for everything we discussed.
I'm sorry.
well, at least you're actually taking responsibility for once in your life.
sorry that she left. It's not my fault.
I didn't even want to get involved. You dragged it out of me.
what about the dishwasher and the banana and the toi
she left because of the banana.
I just wanted you to stand up for yourself. Tell her what you want.
if doing that causes her to walk out for the second time, well, your relationship wasn't gonna last anyway.
or you could have stayed out of it.
I could have kept my mouth shut, been annoyed sometimes, but I'd be happy, because I'd still be with her.
now all I have is cold milk.
as long as you're free, you want to grab some dinner?
did Tom go home for the night?
for starters. I told him to leave. I don't want him here.
money is a complicated subject.
Yeah, it's not the money.
I mean, the-- the money's bad, but...
when we first opened our marriage,
I got involved with a guy who lied about being single.
then one day, his wife calls me.
she's crying and screaming and totally out of control.
and I felt...
superior.
I thought I don't ever have to worry about feeling this way because Tom and I are honest with each other.
well, here I am.
sorry I didn't make it home last night.
I needed to run some tests.
you know what the worst part was?
when you had your affair...
wasn't the sex.
it was the lies.
realizing that the narrative of my life was totally wrong.
you weren't stuck in surgery.
you weren't out of town.
I don't want to go through that again.
I told you nothing's-- - Thursday nights.
you have to be home by midnight.
you don't bring her here.
you don't talk to her about me and I don't want to meet her ever in any context.
are you giving me permission to sleep with other women?
it's what you want, isn't it?
I want you.
you want more than me.
you want that thrill.
but I love you.
and I really believe that you love me...
and we have a good life together.
and at this point, either I walk away or I try to accept who you really are.
tomorrow's Thursday.
Yes, it is.
all our tests came back negative.
it's not a clotting disorder.
which means we need to come up with a better idea.
so what causes problems in the stomach, heart, nerves?
Oh, my God.
you know what it is?
Taub's wife gave the green light for an open marriage.
he's wearing cologne, but not the stink of shame.
you got a date.
I am going out with Maya tonight with Rachel's blessing.
mazel Tov?
maybe the problem isn't her blood.
maybe it's the vessels carrying the blood.
no sign of schistocytes or hemolysis.
so you're actually going to sleep with another woman then go home to your wife?
thank God someone's keeping us focused on what's really important.
Taub was gonna do all of that anyway.
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
imaging showed normal diameter in her pulmonary artery.
here's a thought
Taub's wife is now totally on the market.
mind hitting me with her digits?
she would love that, but duty calls.
what's the matter? - My stomach.
same pain as before? - Yeah, but worse.
get the portable ultrasound in here. We need to get a look at her belly.
help me!
pain, pain went away, came back another day.
question is, what brought it back?
physical exam was unrevealing. Ultrasound was clean.
so afterwards, are you gonna shower at your girlfriend's or at home?
patient. Abdominal pain.
Yeah, he's right. Let's get this wrapped up before 6: 00.
Taub turns back into a faithful Pumpkin at midnight.
patient was out with her boy toy before she came in.
maybe the pain was triggered by sexual excitement.
because lying alone in a hospital bed contemplating bankruptcy-- hot.
my point was that arousal is a function of the parasympathetic nervous system.
if that's where the problem is, the pain could be triggered by crying, which seems pns. Also controls digestion, which she's been doing without screaming her head off since she's been here.
what if what matters isn't when the pain started, but when it stopped?
it was during an X-ray. You think that cured her?
no, but House prepped her for the X-ray with a barium enema.
well, that wouldn't treat anything except
go.
you're in pain because part of your intestine folded in on itself.
it's called an intussusception.
it's cutting off blood flow. We need to fix it before your bowel gets necrotic and dies.
once you do that, will I get better?
when this happens in adults, it's usually a sign of abdominal cancer.
we'll fix the overlap, and then search your intestine for tumors.
foam?
I have a bad feeling about this.
a friend can't spontaneously buy an overpriced italian espresso machine for another friend?
what did you do?
nothing. That's the beauty.
I genuinely tried to help Wilson.
I told him to stand up for himself, which you know is legitimate advice.
and his relationship blew up.
is he okay? - Ah, he'll be fine.
point is, I realized something.
I do nice things, nice things happen to me. Karma works.
so you're paying it forward?
if this should somehow lead to Lucas dying or oral sex, so be it.
Namaste.
think I should wear a tie tonight?
this isn't weird at all.
I mean, where's Rachel eating tonight?
home.
what if she's going out too?
she is allowed to, right?
of course. It's only fair.
but I don't think she will.
your wife only eats dinner at home?
if she did go out, that would be tough, but I think I can handle it.
don't do it unless you're sure.
I know I'd rather be jealous than a liar.
got something here.
Kelly clamp and scalpel.
biopsy showed non-specific inflammation, which suggests ibd, only it doesn't explain the cardiac problems.
or her declining kidney function.
we ran panels during surgery.
actually, ibd does make sense, 'cause it could trigger ankylosing spondylitis, which would explain the heart and the kidneys.
start her on sulfasalazine and tnf-inhibitors.
Oh, and Taub, I'm not gonna see you before you head off for gomorrah.
just remember, if you get disoriented...
breathe through your nose and look for the horizon.
I can't.
I really thought I could do this.
logically, it makes perfect sense.
but...
all afternoon, all I kept thinking about was the two of you, together, and you touching her.
nothing's happened.
it's okay.
I'm sorry.
cause I really wanted it
no.
I've been an idiot, and I don't need anything else. I just need you.
you mean that?
I do.
I love you, Rachel. - I love you too.
let's go home.
is that okay?
there are other doctors.
the treatment's not working.
her left kidney failed last night. The other one's right behind it.
it's not ankylosing spondylitis.
kidney biopsy showed she had iga nephropathy, which could be caused by or associated with any of these conditions.
we've gone from too few ideas to too many, and our patient's running out of time.
why the lack of afterglow?
physio girl not as freaky as you'd hoped?
I went home with my wife.
after all that, you chickened out.
I can't hurt Rachel like that.
sickle cell anemia would have shown on blood tests.
no flattened intestinal villi rules out celiac.
Seriously?
our patient's dying, and we can't move past my sex life?
seriously, you'd think it'd kill her if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?
time's up.
normal liver enzymes rules out hep b and cirrhosis.
Alport and anti-gbm antibody are both untreatable, so if she has them we can't help her.
and it can't be henoch-schonlein purpura.
no inciting respiratory infection and no rash.
I don't care what it's not. I want to know what it could be.
well, everything left on the list.
the list was not created equal.
neither was man, by the way.
hemochromatosis is a possibility.
excess iron builds up, causes problems throughout the body.
weil's syndrome also affects multiple organ systems, and it wouldn't have been treated by the antibiotic the E. R. gave her.
sarcoidosis makes sense too.
good. Treat for those three.
I think you should call Tom.
am I gonna die?
I don't know.
if he walked in here right now,
I'd look in his face and all I would think is "liar.
don't you think that's kind of unfair?
you say honesty's all-important, but you conveniently ignore the truth that some truths hurt people.
Tom lied to protect you.
he was covering his ass.
I'm not talking about the money.
Tom hasn't slept with anyone else in over a year.
he told you that?
so my entire marriage is a sham?
no.
your husband, who only wants you, lied so that you could be happy.
that seems pretty real to me.
yeah?
listen, I'm sorry.
me too. I shouldn't have said
no, you were right. I was selfish back then.
I'm trying to change.
and I don't know if it's House or what, but...
you're different too.
I'm trying.
I always thought that I was keeping the peace, but I was just resenting you and giving you a reason to leave.
I wish we had this fight ten years ago.
is it okay if we don't give House the credit?
Oh, I recommend it.
o" for three. Her kidney function is still declining.
we're gonna need to start dialysis.
glad the husband's back.
after missing so many little deaths, he should be here for the big one.
top six, anyone? Polyarteritis nodosa?
we'd have seen some improvement on prednisone.
guy's wife's dying, and he stops to buy flowers.
they're from his garden. Mercury poisoning fits.
those are lilacs.
my mom used to grow lilacs.
my dad made her get rid of them,'cause there were too many bees.
we ruled out hsp 'cause there was no inciting respiratory infection.
but in rare cases, it can also be triggered by a bee sting.
we also ruled it out because there's no rash.
maybe we just didn't see it.
have you been stung by a bee recently?
uh, about a month ago.
what's going on?
I think your wife has henoch-schonlein purpura.
systemic vasculitis can cause lesions and inflammations throughout the body.
it's pretty awful, which explains why it was named after a German.
actually two germans.
lesions can pop up in the heart, sometimes in the kidneys, but always on the skin.
means you'd have a rash somewhere.
I don't. - Not that you know of.
okay, I'm gonna have to check your holes.
I'll start with the mouth. If there's nothing there, then things might have to get kinky.
say aah.
I was kinda hoping for kinky.
is that good or bad?
we'll treat her with high-dose ivig and cyclophosphamide.
you should be fine.
I'm gonna be okay.
I love you.
that is adorable.
other than you still wanting to have sex with other dudes, and him bankrupting your family,
I think you kids are pretty much home free.
and...
you two made up? - No.
you can thank me later.
I'm all-in.
all right.
fold.
met you yesterday out in the place where here in the corner of your eye Now you hold a heart that was not mine to give for I cannot feel alive the way that you are you need a hand?
the way that I am thanks.
when I'm with you the way that I feel sorry about canceling the other night.
me too.
the way that I am with you the way that I feel the way that you want me you wanna go somewhere?
the car's full of gas.
you sure?
and if I'm not?
you'll be paying me back for those damn invitations.
Oh, well, then never mind.
Ted is a wonderful man, dad.
he's the second greatest guy I ever met.
guess that's us.
into this Holy estate, these two persons now come to be joined.
and so if any person may show just cause why they may not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
that's what I like to hear.
do you, Theodore Philip Taylor, take Nicole Margaret Murray to be your wife and promise before God and these witnesses to be her loving and faithful husband, in plenty and in want, in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, so long as you both shall live?
I - I - This isn't funny, Ted.
are you all right?
what time is it?
happy time.
I'm still asleep.
just think of this as a dream.
what about House?
I said a dream, not a nightmare.
he's in the next room.
sound asleep.
I met the neighbors.
sir, do you know this man?
I don't need a temporary. I need a permanent.
yesterday.
please do.
good morning. - Hardly.
one of my P. A.s quit an hour ago, and I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.
that's nothing. I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.
any bed you're in is the wrong one.
that's not what your mama said.
I'll be going now. To human resources.
he started it.
it was the neighbor's kid's bed.
luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy.
how drunk were you?
about yea drunk.
are you okay?
you shouldn't be drinking at all, much less-- you sound just like Esteban's mom.
I need you in the clinic.
sorry, I'm busy.
tell me you have a case. You know, even if you don't.
I have a case.
sounds interesting. I'll take it.
I owe you one. Now tell me you don't have a case.
I really have a case.
we're even.
you guys know how to honeymoon.
this is Dr. House.
aphasia and syncope.
he can't speak.
"aphasia" is Greek for loss of voice.
we've ruled out infection, vocal cord damage, and stroke.
a lot of guys syncope at the altar.
it's Greek for "having the vapors."
we ruled out all the common causes of fainting:
low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, dehydratio don't say "ah"
do you know what it is?
roll on your side and lift up your gown.
there's one thing they didn't test for.
a test for what?
faking.
test was positive.
I - I can - I can talk. I - I wasn't faking.
my voice just came back right now.
Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince.
I know he wasn't faking.
well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper.
what about the syncope?
well, the - is she buying this too?
why would he fake anything?
it's Greek for "duh."
still, you get to keep the engagement ring.
I don't think he was faking.
that's because you're more gullible than I am.
for instance, I don't believe that you called off your open marriage.
I believe your wife called it off, and you called off telling her that you weren't calling it off.
a guy doesn't just throw a golden ticket in the trash.
the same way a guy doesn't give up a lucrative medical practice to come work for you?
that's exactly why you dabble.
you're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.
I'm not that predictable.
for example, you're probably not expecting me to ask you out for dinner tonight.
no, thanks.
you won't even consider it?
I did, just very quickly.
the truth is, since I called this thing off, my wife has been very grateful and I could do with a down night.
if I go out with the boss, nobody can blame me.
okay. If you bring your wife.
no. That's the point.
I need a little - you're lying.
I'm not lying.
then I'm not going.
okay. Fontina at 8: 30.
you believe me, right?
of course I believe you.
then let's do it.
we'll tell a cab to take us to AC right now and get it done.
you're serious? You just walked out of the emergency room.
exactly. I walked out. I feel great.
well, we do have the clothes for it.
Ted, what's wrong?
are you - what's wrong? Oh, my God.
can somebody help us?
please! Please hurry.
just breathe. Oh, my God.
there's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding.
a Tweet, for example.
pleural effusion.
you think his lung is faking it?
there's at least 200 ccs of fluid in there.
okay, let's say all his symptoms are real.
explain how one of them suddenly went away without using the words "virgin" or "mary."
if the pleural effusion's caused by something systemic, it could explain his other two symptoms.
and so whether you believe him or not, all we have to figure out is what caused the pe.
er ruled out infection. Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.
a medication he's not telling us about.
you really don't trust this guy, do you?
I don't even trust the ER.
let's rule out infections by ourselves.
tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure.
we already - this time, talk about nuptials while you do it.
check his home for everything else.
he just moved in with his fiancee three months ago.
toxic exposure could take longer than that to manifest.
you check his love nest.
you two check his swinging bachelor pad.
that somebody else now lives in?
I assume so.
not the glass. No!
the place looks like...1960s?
could have lead paint.
you think a 27-year-old has pica?
if it gets us out of here before the owner comes back, yes.
What'd you tell that cute physio?
that I changed my mind.
no, you didn't.
you're more nervous than usual.
because this B and E has actual B.
Wha... That's a suspended ceiling.
what are you doing?
I want to see what's above it.
more ceiling.
made of 40-year-old acoustic tile.
asbestosis. I like it. I'll be in the car.
what the hell?
uh, it's okay.
we're doctors. Nobody was home, so - well, I'm calling the police.
do you know Ted Taylor? He used to live here.
Yeah. What about him?
he's our patient at Princeton Plainsboro.
is he okay? - We think he may have asbestosis from your ceiling tiles.
they're not asbestos. I had 'em checked when I moved in.
how sick is he?
is he a friend of yours? - He was.
actually, he was my boyfriend for three years.
I'm not gay. - Really?
cause it would certainly explain the cold feet.
Oh, and the boyfriend.
so you're bisexual?
no, I'm straight. Cotter, the guy you met, he's gay.
he had a crush on me. I left.
after three years? - Well, it's possible.
it doesn't mean you're gay just 'cause the guy you're sleeping with is.
we weren't sleeping together. What's this got to do with anything?
lung tap turned up mononucleosis.
er doesn't routinely test for it.
it explains the pe and can be virtually asymptomatic.
so we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono?
you're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised.
if there's been any unprotected sex, we'll need to test for HIV.
there's been no sex of any kind.
okay. I'll go test your fiancee for HIV.
is she the curious sort?
wait.
there may have been some contact, but I'm not gay.
sodomy, one of the top ten most common household accidents.
I did a lot of stupid things, but I turned my life around.
I'm as straight as any of you.
you don't have to believe me. I'm just saying you can test me...
as long as you don't tell Nicole.
what business is it of hers?
I don't see anything wrong with him marrying a straight woman.
how about, it'll make them both miserable?
just like most straight marriages.
he's got the right to life, liberty, and unhappiness, like the rest of us.
absolutely no reason to look at me.
I'm not saying it's a great choice. Just saying it's his choice.
it has to be hers as well, which it can't be as long as she doesn't know he's gay.
which is how it's gonna stay since we have no right to tell her.
like you've never bent the rules.
you date guys.
you date girls. I assume at some point, you're gonna make a choice.
I don't lie about who I am.
patients lying never bothered you before.
patients weren't lying about their sexual orientation before.
so you're only judgmental when it gets personal.
does it bother me that people hurt others because they're too weak to face the truth?
Yeah. Sorry about that.
tell me she's not looking at me.
he's negative? - Yep.
looks like being gay didn't make him sick.
so maybe being straight did.
the test was negative. No HIV.
I told you.
what you didn't tell us is how you turned your life around.
it can be pretty hard. It was.
downright impossible on your own.
I talked to some people.
it was more than just talk, wasn't it?
I know this is personal stuff.
I'm here to help you, not out you.
I had therapy.
conversion therapy.
went to a camp for three weeks of intensive rehabilitation.
they injected him with emetics while he watched gay porn.
Apomorphine?
or lithium chloride or cyclophosphamide. He doesn't know.
and when that didn't work, they shot him up with male hormones.
a chemical assault like that could explain the pe.
and the ECT explains the rest.
they gave him electroconvulsive therapy to make him straight?
to zap the fabulous right out of him.
neural damage accounts for the aphasia. - ECT doesn't cause neural damage.
unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-man quackery camp.
run an EEG.
see if they straightened him or just scrambled him.
sorry. I completely forgot.
my wife just started a ceramics class Tuesdays at 8: 00.
it's a half-hour drive from here. She won't be back till 10: 30.
she's taking it with her girlfriend marly.
she hopes to make a tea service.
you want to call her?
no need. I already texted her.
and here she is now.
I think you're still seeing the physio.
you've got a backup suit in your car.
don't want to be bringing home da stank.
okay, yes, you're right, about everything. But please, House. Don't tell her.
Hi, Rachel. - Hi, Dr. House.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Hi, honey. Got your text, obviously.
I'm just leaving. I've got a ceramics class.
Really? - I love it.
even managed to talk Chris into signing up for one.
of course, he's in the beginners' class.
you're in a ceramics class?
friday nights, right?
friday nights. Sounded like fun.
you should join Chris'.
you know, I should.
well, gotta go.
making a tea service.
Hi, I must have fallen asleep in the lounge.
what are they doing? - An EEG.
what's it for?
we're looking for neurological damage that could have caused his symptoms.
damage from what?
a head trauma.
he had an accident?
it wasn't an accident. It was before he met you.
well, what happened? Was he hospitalized?
you should ask him about it.
they have the results.
everything looks normal.
look at this.
beta waves are spiking.
what's that mean?
I'm not sure.
he's coding. Crash cart.
what's happening to him?
he's having a heart attack.
charging. Clear.
EKG showed no abnormalities.
so what caused the arrest?
four ways to stop a heart.
electrical problems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds.
I think that's three things.
and cheating.
Oh, no. Sorry.
that's how you break a heart.
I found a ceramics class in Trenton on Friday nights that was full so my wife couldn't join me.
EP study ruled out shocks.
now you just have to find some pottery by Taub.
the lamer it looks, the better.
so we'll do an angio to see if it's blocks or bleeds.
you should be a doctor.
I'm gonna check out this new lesbian bar tonight.
your life is awesome.
you want to come?
I was telling a 33-year-old woman that she has breast cancer.
no, you weren't. - How do you know?
because if you were, you'd need to see the pain in her eyes so she could see the concern in yours.
why are you setting me up on dates with my team?
Taub asking me out was quirky, but Thirteen doing it is a barking cat.
I'm doing it to help you.
by setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with?
and Thirteen?
I've been spending more time with Sam.
I know it's been hard on you.
I figured if you had some company-- I don't need your help.
then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.
I gave him a dollar.
how much did you have to pay? - Nothing.
I just told them you might be feeling down and it was in their self-interest to keep you company.
100 bucks. Foreman held out for 200.
house, I'm worried about you. You could have ended up in jail or worse.
racking you with guilt.
so I do something really stupid and you reward me.
read any parenting manual. That's not helping me. That's helping you.
fine, I did it for me, for my relationship, out of pure self-interest.
okay. - You'll do it?
for you.
thank you.
it's not gonna work, though.
maybe.
but how bad can a night out at a lesbian bar be.
how are you doing?
heart attack at 27.
um, they said you had a head trauma.
I fell off a stepladder and...and hit my head. It was a stupid accident.
an accident.
we need to prep you for your angio.
valium will help you relax.
we're gonna run a line through your femoral artery.
Ted? - He's having another heart attack?
I don't think so. His heart rate seems normal.
are you okay?
you weren't discussing wedding plans, were you?
no. I guess I just...
fainted.
P. O.T. S. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
bp plummets when he's upright, reverts to normal when he's lying down.
he was lying down both times we took his blood pressure.
protracted hypotension could have induced his heart attack.
also explains the syncope.
and his aphasia. He was upright, then you laid him down on the bed to test him.
bp reverted to normal. Voice came back.
jabbing him with the needle had nothing to do with it.
P. O.T. S. can be brought on by a viral or bacterial infection such as mono.
so load him up with fludrocortisone.
you didn't read your ceramics course description, did you?
Yeah. You did?
as I'm sure your wife did.
so we all know they're doing a fourth of July theme.
she'll be expecting something star-spangled.
yes?
cotter Macklin. I'm an old friend of Ted's.
how's he doing?
um, he had a heart attack.
Oh, my God.
they have him on some new meds.
really knocked him out.
well, how are you holding up?
I'm okay. Thanks.
um, I brought this for him.
that's his favorite thing in the whole world.
I know.
you weren't at the wedding, were you?
no, I-I wasn't invited.
Ted and I had a-a falling out.
how did you know each other?
um, we met senior year of college.
Yeah, we - we shared a house for a while.
you were roommates?
for three years.
I'm - I'm sorry. I-I just miss him.
I think you should leave.
I shouldn't have done that. - Now.
please.
I hope he gets better.
Hey, how are you feeling?
don't know yet. - Your numbers look good.
we're gonna keep you on these meds.
you had a visitor while you were asleep.
Oh, yeah?
cotter. Who is he?
I shared a house with him after college. I don't know why he would show up.
that's it?
Yeah. Why? What did he say?
I need to hear it from you, Ted.
one night, I got really drunk and I went to bed.
and he came into my room.
one thing led to another.
the whole thing was a mistake.
are you saying you had sex with him?
I was drunk and confused.
you're gay?
no. I thought I was.
I even made up my mind to tell my family.
I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, psyching myself up.
all I could see was disgust.
and that's when I realized, I didn't hate the thought of admitting I was gay because I was ashamed.
I hated the thought because I wasn't gay.
and that was the day I went to get help.
so you're not gay?
they cured me, Nicole.
that's what all the head trauma is about.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it's - it's all in the past now.
it doesn't matter anymore.
what is it?
Oh, my head!
he's got severe headaches.
so do I.
should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?
no. What about infection?
that's what we're thinking.
cerebral infection would explain the headaches, could have caused P. O.T. S.
if it's fungal, it could have spread to the heart.
I was talking about you.
has the little gent been wearing a tent?
remind me why that has anything to do with you.
a distracted person makes a distracted professional.
and destroying my marriage will help me focus.
probably.
do a spinal tap. Run the CSF.
still talking about you.
but you can do it on the patient, too, if you want.
what about her? - The bartender?
she's the only one who's not here for fun.
trust me, she's not straight.
if your gaydar is so great, how come you didn't know about the patient till you met his boyfriend?
the guy walked in with his bride.
it took me a while to rotate my dish.
it's unbelievable what he's doing to her.
you don't think he loves her?
he may love her, but he needs to have sex with other men.
Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women.
Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to her too, but it's hardly the same.
to be faithful to his wife, our patient has to deny his identity.
Taub just needs to-- to resist a biological imperative?
it is easier to say no to dessert than to pretend you don't eat.
says someone who's obviously never been on a diet.
Oh, yeah. My life's a breeze.
you're successful, smart, and you attract everything that moves.
if you want to focus on the fact that you're not gonna see 50, that's your choice.
you know what? I agree with you.
my self-pity's optional. What about yours?
yeah?
CSF was negative for infection, and his headaches are worse.
we were just talking about you.
please don't.
it's not P. O.T. S.so we're back to square one.
not quite.
you did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse.
we're maxing him out on morphine.
he sprung a leak.
he's losing CSF from the tap site.
we made his headaches worse?
just you, actually.
that still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.
the low pressure in his brain caused the P. O.T. S.not the other way around.
patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF.
there. That should stop the leak.
you should be feeling some relief soon.
I spoke to my parents.
how are they doing?
they're still worried.
well, tell them not to be.
everything's gonna be okay.
what's happening? - He's stroking.
both eyes are responsive.
tell me your full name.
theodore Philip Taylor. - This isn't a stroke.
then what is it?
what's happening to me?
it's really not P. O.T. S. We're really back to square one.
so what's masquerading as a stroke?
voted the worst Halloween costume, by the way.
MRA showed no problems with blood flow to the brain. Rules out T. I.A.
- Chest x-rays showed no hilar masses.
any luck with the pottery?
wasn't easy. Bought a suitably cruddy set of fife and drum napkin rings online.
Scleroderma? - Skin's fine.
A. N.A. was negative. So what did that set you back?
too much. I got into a bidding war with some lunatic.
histoplasmosis. - EIA was clear.
Hey, could have gone a lot higher than $215.
you're kissmyasthma99?
what about melas?
mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes.
no, idiot. Lactate levels are stable.
we're missing something.
we've run every test that makes sense, asked every question we can think of, gone over his history a dozen times.
we know how much we can trust his history.
if history is written by the Victor, how do we find out what really happened?
talk to the loser. - Call the boyfriend.
let's get them all in the same room.
or we could question them separately and not torture them.
or we could get them all in the same room and get the truth.
drinks are on me and Foreman tonight.
can't. Pap smear.
we don't want to do it either, but Wilson already paid us.
it's gonna suck.
I know.
where and when?
any incidents of dizziness?
seizures?
blackouts?
other than our wedding day.
don't you think I would have told you if there were?
my sister's birthday.
I was drunk.
you had one Martini.
on an empty stomach.
look, he was just sitting on the couch, and then he - he - he fell over and that was it.
well, once I slept it off, I was fine.
well, I stayed up that night, checking on him every 15 minutes.
what about sex?
Yes, I have sex with my girlfriend, because I'm not gay.
we have sex. - Thank you.
no problems?
um, well, there have been some... - Nic.
issues.
erectile dysfunction? - Every guy has it sometimes.
we never had that problem.
gee, that must be because Ted doesn't like girls.
or because it's vascular.
I know we did an MRA, but arterial disease causing acute ischemia could explain the heart, neuro symptoms, and maybe even P. O.T. S.
might I suggest a diagnostic test?
the penile plethysmograph measures changes in blood flow in your penis.
tells us if there's a circulatory problem.
you just need to be in the right... state.
what's your pleasure?
I feel terrible. I-I don't think anything's gonna work.
then we'll have to give you a shot.
where you don't want to get one.
shot it is.
he kept dreamin' dreamin dreamin' ooh, that someday he'd be the star superstar, but he didn't get far but he sure found out the hard way that dreams don't always come true dreams don't always come true uh-uh, nouh-uh, no oh, he's leavin' eavin' leavin'
on that midnight train to Georgia leavin' on a midnight train mm-hmm, yeah said he's going back to find going back to find going back to find ooh, a simpler place and time when he takes that ride oh, yes he is guess who's gonna be right by his sid I'm gonna be with him
I know you will I know you will on that midnight train to Georgia leavin' on a midnight train to Georgia whoo-whoo
I'd rather live in his world live in his world live in his world than live without him in mine world, world is his his world my world, mine and his alone his and hers alone
I've got to go is his I've got to go
I've got to go his and hers alone
nobody wants to follow that.
the night just keeps getting better.
to Wilson.
everything looks fine.
you sure?
medically, that's good news.
are you feeling feverish? You're sweating.
no. I feel lousy, but I don't know why I'm sweating.
what is it?
you're not sweating.
you're lactating.
can't tell his fiancee he's gay, how is he gonna tell her he's pregnant?
his therapists loaded him with hormones.
male hormones don't make you lactate.
except they could screw up your thyroid.
that was over three months ago. We just started milking him last night.
so something else screwed up his thyroid.
graves, hashimoto's.
Nope. TSH was normal.
pituitary tumor.
could also explain his libido and heart issues.
and if the tumor's big enough, his headaches and syncope.
except we - we cleared him for cancer.
didn't say cancer.
Prolactinomas can be benign.
check his prolactin level, then MRI his pituitary.
sounds like you had fun last night.
you believe Chase?
I believe Foreman.
and they had fun with you.
what happened?
I realized that they could be my friends.
you're serious.
and then I sobered up.
you weren't that drunk.
you managed to find your way into your own little bed last night.
I think I sleep better in rocket ship sheets.
no, you want to blame this on the booze, but that's easy.
change is hard.
and wisdom is knowing the difference between what you can change...
and what you were born with.
and cowardice is labeling what you don't want to change as innate.
I was winning this argument.
pituitary MRI - was normal.
how are the headaches?
terrible.
give me your head. - What the hell?
I know. It's the first time you've heard that sentence with a possessive pronoun.
Oh, wow, that - that's better.
okay, enough.
how cool is that?
you have a chiari malformation, a narrowing in the base of your skull that can cut off CSF flow.
but it wasn't a problem until the ECT at breeder boot camp caused your brain to swell just enough to plug the opening.
and when your brain pressed up against your pituitary, it signed you up for la leche league.
you still won't be pitching a tent for your lady, but that's just because, you know, she's a lady.
its orthostatic effect was mimicking P. O.T. S.
it also does an uncanny Christopher Walken.
unfortunately, if you treat it like P. O.T. S.it gets worse.
so as far as that goes, oops.
proper treatment is surgery. We'll get you in right away.
so how did I get this thing?
overbearing mother.
kidding. CM's congenital.
like so many other things, you were born that way.
I thought you might be running low, so...
Thanks.
I'm not coming back.
Ted, this is a mistake.
I know you're hurting, and I'm sorry.
I'm talking about hurting her.
I love her.
thank you for your support.
we both really appreciate it.
good luck.
you know what I've been thinking?
it's your birthday in three weeks.
what do you say we rebook the church and make it a doubleheader?
I don't know, Ted.
less than a week ago we were standing at the altar, perfectly happy.
nothing's changed.
Really?
I still love you.
do you still love me?
Yes.
but - then that's all that matters.
but I think that you still love him.
I'm not gay, Nicole.
I promise you.
how can you promise me that?
because I believe that we get to choose how we live our lives, and I've made my choice.
so now I have to make mine.
I'm sorry.
no. No.
I'm not saying good-bye.
Yeah.
I want to marry you. I have to marry you.
it's Friday night.
I called it off.
for real this time.
frees you up for the next one.
one day at a time.
napkin rings.
my way of saying thanks.
for trying to wreck your marriage?
for trying to save it.
and I get napkin rings?
expensive ones.
I hired a replacement.
for my P. A.
she seems great.
good work. - You too.
your patient's going home tomorrow.
he doesn't have a home.
you want to grab a bite to eat?
so Wilson got to you too?
no. This is just me.
Lucas? - Working late.
I'm buying.
I'm not that hungry.
okay.
I just want us to be friends.
funny.
that's the last thing I want us to be.
let's get back to Phil and Diane.
Phil's been having a hard time finding work, and Diane wants him to talk to her about his fear, his disappointment.
and Phil wants Diane to trust him that they'll get through this, ideally, without having to keep discussing feelings.
not your exact words, but am I wrong?
and most guys out there are the same way, but ladies, if you're feeling frustrated, remember, it's not our fault.
we were raised to be strong, not emotional, to deny vulnerability, not embrace it.
all done. Okay.
Oh, something's wrong. I think I peed myself.
is that from the testosterone?
it couldn't be.
I don't think you're going home just yet.
it's not a plumbing problem. Means it's probably neurological.
And?
and name Dominika's three brothers.
Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and...
low testosterone is off the table as a symptom.
guy got his nuts cracked three years ago.
don't need to look much further than that.
so his hose just happens to spring a leak at the same time he's in a hospital for a totally unrelated problem.
Fjodor. It's Fedir.
if low testosterone means I can't get sick with something else, then punch me in the junk right now. I would, if it weren't redundant.
is Fedir the one who married Mykola?
mykola is Dominika's uncle.
how is it you can retain every detail of our habits and personal lives, and none of this?
cause I find it hard to remember things I don't give a crap about.
ergo, Dominika has one brother, and his name is Al.
maybe the testicular damage set the stage for something worse.
multiple Sclerosis causes incontinence, and progresses faster in men with low T.
way to stay on point.
it's that kind of leadership that's putting you at the head of the pack.
there is no pack. She's the only applicant.
well, that's settled, then.
have your underlings do an LP and get a cranio-spinal MRI to check for plaques associated with M. S.
I will go tell Foreman about your promotion.
wait.
so nobody cares about the job till I apply, and suddenly it's the last limited-edition lightsaber at Comic-Con.
just seems like it should go to someone with more... Seniority.
meaning you. I said "more," not "most."
meaning you or Taub House is a dictator.
second in command is a meaningless position. Doesn't look meaningless on my resume.
doesn't have to be meaningless at all.
the right person could turn it into something. Get the department running smoothly.
I wonder who that "right person" could be. House is the head of the department.
it's only fair that a woman should hold the other position of authority.
Yeah, let's go affirmative action on this, because then I'll definitely win.
this is what House wants.
wind us up and watch us fight over an empty title, which would make us extra stupid because of what we've just been through.
we should let him choose whoever he wants and move on.
so if these proteins are in my spinal fluid, that means I have M. S?
proteins may indicate M.S. There's no one definitive test.
that's why Dr. House ordered an MRI as well.
this is anesthetic.
it's a scary diagnosis.
but advances are being made.
several drugs approved just this year.
to be honest, at the moment, I'm feeling a little more worried about the testosterone injections.
it's making me feel, uh, different.
just kind of amped.
I went through this big life change, and it felt really...
meaningful.
but what if it was all just chemistry?
loss of testosterone could have been a factor, but think of it as a catalyst.
it got you to reevaluate. Now you know what's important.
you can choose to hold onto that.
right?
it's certainly worth trying.
deep breath, stay very still.
just tell House to drop the whole team leader thing . that's the only way it'll go away.
I don't think it's such a bad idea.
a little more structure in your department couldn't hurt.
Yeah.
house is doing this because of his great love of structure, not because he wants us to turn on each other.
so don't do that.
it makes sense to have someone in there with a little more accountability.
as long as it's not Adams.
she sees the whole thing as an opportunity to remake the department in her image.
or Park, for obvious reasons.
and Taub's got the kids. He's pretty busy.
are you seriously angling for a job that you mocked its fate the whole time I had it?
I don't want the job.
you just don't want anyone else to have it.
this'll be great.
your grandmother's kind of sexy.
that is Taras Shevchenko, the greatest Ukrainian poet.
is he the guy behind "There once was a man from Kremenchuk"?
help me move coffee table.
well, then where will we have coffee?
and by "coffee" I mean scotch. Coffee and booze are artificial high for me.
high is in exercise.
dance aerobics. Fun, and good for the butt.
Amy Grant?
I know. But there's a hot girl jumping up and down in my living room, so...
you have a limited amount of time to learn a ton of uninteresting facts.
welcome to my wheelhouse.
you brought a protractor?
you never know when you might need to make a pie chart.
looks like someone is currying favor for the team leader position.
Yes.
we'll be using a basic alphabet technique with a mnemonic multiplier.
in high school, they called me "The Bookie Monster."
pop quiz. Where did you get the candlesticks?
on three. One, two, three.
Morocco. -- Denver.
drink up.
it's gonna be a long night.
you really think this guy's gonna hulk out once the hormones kick in?
some male lizards do push-ups to attract mates.
when scientists gave them extra testosterone, they did push-ups until they died.
same drive you took advantage of to get Chase to carry a box of files down to your car yesterday.
periventricular and subcortical white matter are clean.
so you're saying masculinity is ingrained and irrational.
I'm saying it's pointless to try
by extension, you're also saying femininity is enlightened and rational.
it's the way we should all be, guys just are incapable of it.
brain stem and cord are clean.
is it okay if I scratch my nose?
go ahead.
guess he doesn't have M. S.
something's wrong.
is it your hand? No, it's my eyes.
I'm-I'm seeing double.
smile. It's your honeymoon.
so what causes double vision on top of all the other symptoms?
it's not a brain tumor or we would've seen it on the scans.
eye exam didn't offer anything conclusive. Let's do some winter shots.
wardrobe change. Thyroid eye disease in conjunction with Graves.
thyroid level was normal.
check it out.
simpson traded this in exchange for me helping out on some of my days off.
quite the display of initiative and leadership.
but you're way too smart to fall for a blatant bribe like that.
or a blatant flaunting of cleavage. Like those.
what happened to not letting House get to you?
you're like lemmings, marching off the cliff of competitive humiliation.
all I'm doing is my job. House has indicated that he considers me attractive.
there's nothing wrong with me using my strengths to my advantage.
with an argument like that, maybe you should just drop down to your knees and
I mean, unless that's not your strength.
Oh, big hug, big man. It's cold out here.
at the risk of derailing this very productive photo shoot and bickering session, what about myasthenia gravis?
Extra-ocular muscle weakness leads to double vision, atonic bladder leads to incontinence.
could've been triggered when his T got really low.
Ooh, a little one.
he'd be a good pick.
smooth.
you let the rest of them compete, tear each other to pieces, then you swoop in with a save.
start the patient on IVIG and plasmapheresis.
can you handle that, please?
I need a minute.
well, make it quick. We're doing Memphis.
you think you want this, but it's a bad idea.
I was gonna go Dollywood, but I'm not sure I could off that wig.
everybody was playing nice, and in your world, nice doesn't solve cases, but after what happened, a little bonding is a good thing.
we still have ideas, we still argue.
maybe it could work better if we appreciate each other.
that was impressive.
you said that whole thing without once moving your lips.
the ones you're not moving.
Oh. I get it.
I won't play along with your stupid games, so I'm no longer a man.
clever.
actually, you won't play along with my stupid games because you're no longer a man.
still clever, though.
studies have shown that raising kids lowers testosterone levels in men.
the more involved you are, the lower it gets.
right. Having kids has neutered me.
or maybe it's helped me finally grow up.
how are you feeling?
as long as I keep my eyes closed, pretty good.
really good, actually.
I got energy, I feel confident, clear.
testosterone does tend to perk you up.
Hey, Hon. I brought you a burger.
Really? You're in the hospital. Eat whatever you want.
you're the best wife ever.
and I'm not just saying that because of how great your ass looks in those jeans.
I'm sorry. That was
no, it's okay. Girl likes to know she's appreciated.
come here.
so I think we should talk to Leading Lights about seminars and DVDs.
are you sure? You were worried about the commitment.
Yeah, there's no point in being in business with them halfway.
you okay with that? It's good to finally have a decision.
okay.
Fedir is the brother she worries about the most.
ever since Luba passed.
sorry.
but this is the closest we could find to the cold, soulless offices of a government bureaucracy.
if you're not using your office, I will.
does Dominika still communicate with her high school friends? Uh, Vasyl, yes.
Oksana, no. Not since she kissed Pavlo.
cause that bitch knew that Dominika liked him.
wrong.
Oh, Oksana is a slut. Dead to me.
the right answer is the wrong answer.
no husband would pay that much attention to his wife's friend dramas.
haven't you been divorced three times?
in-between those divorces, I was married, non-fraudulently, for 12 years total, which is 12 years longer than anyone in this room.
move.
so are you going for this team leader thing?
probably. You deserve it.
you have way more experience than me. You're giving up?
I wish.
I still have a lot of med school debt, and my parents need help with their mortgage.
so I could kinda use the money.
as of an hour ago, I'm just seeing one of everything. Looks like you guys were right.
we'll be right back.
I could use the money? You want to game me, you gotta do better than that.
chase -- You want to be a leader, you have to know how to manipulate.
you can't just spill
I think the whites of his eyes were yellow.
everything okay? Jaundice.
there's something wrong with your liver.
liver function tests confirm his enzymes are totally out of whack.
so much for myasthenia gravis. Can we hurry this up?
I have a government to defraud at noon. If you need to leave, you should.
I'm fairly confident our patient's got sarcoidosis.
wow, you said that with so much authority. Did anyone else get chills?
just until I realized our patient has no sign of parenchymal lung abnormalities, which makes sarcoidosis a long shot.
and bookkeeping isn't gonna get you any farther than boobs.
though in fairness, the boobs were really, really helping.
I still think it's myasthenia gravis. Did you miss the recap?
we treated for that. The liver tanked. But his vision got better.
liver problems could be a sign of celiac.
he's been back on gluten since he's been in the hospital. Yesterday he had a burger.
that would've kicked the celiac into gear, causing the liver problems.
so your theory is that he has two unrelated diseases.
and he's already got low testosterone.
I seem to remember something about House hating coincidences. It's true.
I think it's Lyme Disease.
one single disease named "Lyme." Without a rash.
10% of cases present without a rash.
Lyme Disease it is. Start the patient on antibiotics.
now I have to get home before my fake wife gets real annoyed.
something bothering you? I asked the nurse for an extra pillow.
that was half an hour ago. Sorry.
things can get pretty hectic. It was a pillow.
I mean, how hard can a pil listen to me. I'm being a jerk.
testosterone can give you a shorter temper even when you're not sick.
you noticed and adjusted. That's a good thing.
just got a call from our lawyer.
you changed our counter to leading lights?
you deserve proper billing and a salary bump in the second term.
we talked about this. We decided it wasn't worth potentially blowing the deal.
it'll be fine.
I've got to get some work done.
these are such pretty flowers you buy for me every Friday, from Japanese florist, on corner of Edison and Conway.
just one more thing.
with this ring, I thee wedded.
you left it here when you skipped town with your boyfriend.
you kept the rings.
actually, I tried to trade them to a hooker for unspecified favors, but it turns out she doesn't accept zinc.
like modern fairytale.
Dr. and Mrs. Gregory House? Yeah.
Nate Weinmann. U.S. Immigration.
welcome to our home.
give him time.
when I was 14, there was a girl I wanted to impress, so I jumped off the roof of her house. Broke my ankle.
Joe's basically going through puberty.
it'll take him a while to adjust.
I- I tracked down a video from one of Joe's business coaching seminars from before I knew him.
I'm hearing a lot about the value of compromise.
we don't live on Sesame Street.
we live in the real world, the business world.
if you're not a winner, you're a loser.
if you aren't comfortable with that, go open a pottery studio.
I never would have gone out with the guy in this video.
uh, do you remember the last time she visited Vasyl?
uh, let me see, that would be...
August?
no. No, July.
cause I remember it was right after our half-anniversary, and I forgot to put a gift in her suitcase.
and... I've never heard the end of that one.
house specialty.
I made up this pun.
is it -- Thank you. Mm-hmm.
honey, why do you do this to me? You know I'm watching my weight.
then maybe you'll stop eating cheese in front of open fridge in middle of the night.
this is delicious. Thank you.
so everything looks good in here.
I'm just gonna step out and get a corroborating interview from one of the neighbors.
neighbors? It's-it's middle of the day.
I- I-I think everybody's at work. Yeah, then they're at work.
I just got a form to check off, and you will be on your way to permanent status.
scuse me, sir. Do you have a minute?
how can I help you? Do you know Dr. and Mrs. House?
of course, they've been my neighbors about two years, now.
lovely couple. I see them almost every night.
they seem always to be together. Great, well, thanks for your help.
cheerio.
Hey, what're you doing? That's my door.
handing out menus for a new Chinese place.
you're that guy that plays noisy video games with House on Saturday nights.
there's a simple explanation.
be at my office tomorrow at 10: 00.
the patient's shown zero improvement. Because he's only been on the antibiotics overnight.
or because he doesn't have Lyme Disease.
where are you? Oh, just chillin'.
u.s. citizenship at immigration.
waiting on my fraud interview with my wife and my attorney.
no big. -- House.
hang up.
I still think it's myasthenia gravis plus celiac.
his change in diet has to be significant.
we just need to do an intestinal biopsy to confirm.
with his low platelet count, a biopsy puts him at risk for an abdominal bleed, which puts him at risk of death.
either you're done, or you're walking in there without a lawyer.
I know, it sounds like a phone, but it's a timer to remind me to pee before our meeting.
Hello, old chap. You need to save yourself.
I was up last night trying to find another angle, but I can't.
tell immigration you were in love with Dominika, but your marriage fell apart, and that's why you haven't been living together.
she'll be deported permanently.
house, I know you like Dominika, you have fun with her, but you got caught.
there's no getting out of this.
the best you could hope for is that you don't go back to jail.
tell my team to- to skip the biopsy and give the antibiotics more time.
they're ready for us.
I drew a line in the sand, and I won.
we should be celebrating. Do you need a few minutes?
you're right. I keep getting better.
that's just it. You won.
you made a demand that could've blown up the deal, and you never even asked me.
deal didn't blow up. They caved.
Joe, you say it in your seminars. Process matters just as much as results.
are you seriously busting my chops because I made one little move without you?
how about stepping aside and letting me be the man in this relationship for a change?
I really can't talk to you right now.
I don't know why I said that.
just-I got so angry.
hopefully after this dose, you'll start to feel better, and we can get you home.
but I'd like to do one more test.
the testimony of one angry, nearsighted neighbor shouldn't outweigh all other evidence.
photos, utility bills -- Yes, because your clients would never fake anything.
uh, we acknowledge the neighbor thing was a mistake, but that doesn't mean that all of the other documentation should just be thrown out.
look, look, you know, I get that it's your job to try to act like there's a case here, but shut up.
okay.
uscis will be denying Miss Petrova's green card application.
you'll be referred to immigration court for deportation proceedings, and we're gonna inform your parole officer about evidence of fraud.
so unless anybody has anything else to add...
please, I am begging, do not send him back to jail.
maybe we have not lived together all these- Mrs. House, I have to advise you not to continue.
this man and I, did we marry for love?
no.
but this past week, we have a lot of fun.
working really hard to fool the U.S. government, right? Don't answer that.
way ahead of you.
it was fake, but...
it felt real.
maybe because it becomes real.
this man...
my husband.
I want to stay with him, but if I cannot, please send me away, and let him be free.
I love him.
I didn't buy a word you said.
but a judge might.
I'm gonna let you stay.
but for the next six months, I'm gonna hold onto this file, and our investigators are gonna show up unannounced at 6: 00 a.m. 11: 00 at night, and they better find the two of you sitting on the couch watching NCIS eating ice cream from the same spoon.
or both of you will be sent to places far less pleasant than New Jersey.
what you just said in there... Don't worry.
I'm much too smart to be falling in love with you.
I will be needing extra shelf in bathroom.
abdominal biopsy showed flattened villi.
looks like you were right about celiac.
you do remember Chase got stabbed doing a test House didn't order?
good comparison, since both patients were tweaked on steroids.
you only did this to score points over Chase and Park.
we were right.
I proved it, and the patient didn't bleed out. Why are you being a jerk about this?
let's go see if House is back.
patient's having trouble breathing.
so much for celiac.
his breathing is stabilized, but his lung function is at 60%, and his liver is tanking.
and he has major symptoms of celiac without actually having celiac.
could be Whipple's.
doesn't explain the incontinence.
intestinal lymphoma?
doesn't explain the double vision.
any time you want to jump in.
is dance aerobics even a thing?
I hear it's good for the butt. What about a parasitic infection?
strongyloides is known to damage the small intestine.
in this country, he's about as likely to get that as win Powerball.
someone does win Powerball. Every week.
the patient went to Puerto Rico a few months ago. One of the few places in the U.S.
you could pick up Strongyloides. Treatment is Ivermectin.
we give that to someone with liver problems, he could have seizures, or worse.
do it.
I'm hearing a lot about the value of compromise.
but we don't live on Sesame Street, we live in the real
I was wondering if maybe we overlooked a symptom, or something. Makes perfect sense.
if you're the patient, and "pantywaist" is the symptom.
Adams and I both thought the patient could have celiac, but only she was willing to go out on a limb and run the test.
I gave up.
now you're in here watching a motivational speech.
even your attempt to get your balls back lacks balls.
world, the business world.
if you're not a winner, you're a loser.
his voice-it's lower than it is now.
if only there was a good reason for a professional speaker to be hoarse.
go open a pottery studio.
good point.
it's not a good point. It's a decent point.
you're doing it again. You have any other videos?
other seminars? -- A couple
when you see a weakness, that's a time for strength.
a lot of people say, "Oh, I feel bad about it. The other guy made a mistake."
you bailed too early. Now I get all the credit.
that kind of thinking is what makes you have a bad day.
chronic hoarseness is a symptom of a condition called silent thyroiditis.
but I'm not hoarse. -- Exactly.
but you were three years ago. Silent thyroiditis comes and goes.
and it, in turn, is a symptom of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 3, which makes this a really bad idea.
pas 3 attacks the body's own endocrine system, moving from gland to gland.
it started in the thyroid, and probably helped along by your low testosterone, moved on to the gut.
where it caused celiac disease, or it would've if you weren't on a gluten-free diet.
I was right.
this is incredibly relevant.
eventually, PAS 3 attacked your thymus gland.
you developed myasthenia gravis, which landed you in here, and you started eating gluten, which only made things worse.
so am I gonna be okay?
we'll treat the various conditions with high-dose steroids.
assuming they respond, you should be fine.
and the testosterone?
kicked in the nuts is kicked in the nuts.
over the past week, you've all had good moments and bad.
no one candidate has prevailed.
and so now, we embark upon a contest of medical strength, stamina, and skill.
can we just get this over with?
if the competitor representing Australia would like to take a point deduction, he should, by all means, continue yapping.
your glee is on the verge of making this not worth it for any of us.
can I at least light the torch?
hurry.
I declare open the games of the number one, number two competition.
je declare ouvert- all right. Ready, set, suture!
t time.
what happens if I don't take it?
or at least go to a much lower dose? Are you having side effects?
no, I feel great. Faster, clearer.
more like myself.
but my marriage and my career, they're both built on me being somebody else.
low testosterone can cause depression and problems sleeping.
it's also been linked to conditions such as osteoporosis and diabetes.
it'll make your life harder and more dangerous on top of all the meds you'll be taking.
I'll take that risk.
I'm a better man without it.
well, this certainly has brought more structure to the department.
