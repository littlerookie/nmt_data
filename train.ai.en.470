GSI is spending about$ 5 million this year to launch shoprunner, he said.

gsk already faced thousands of lawsuits in america arising from avandia.
gsk also has a contract with barda to test an antibiotic for gram-negative bacteria.
gsk also is letting its data guide how it negotiates with governments and insurers.
gsk had a journal article published that deliberately underplayed the dangers.
gsk has a long-standing partnership with india's ranbaxy.
gsk has launched promacta, its platelet-boosting drug, at$ 3000 a month in the us, while arguing it represents a therapeutic improvement on more expensive rival products already on the market.
gsk hopes to induce a stronger immune response by combining rts, s with a vaccine from crucell, another drug firm.
gsk hopes to induce a stronger immune response by combining rts, s with a vaccine from crucell, another drug firm.
gsk is cooperating with the investigation, but sales still fell 60% in the third quarter.
gsk makes the point directly about ms ulrich's appointment. "As well as emerging markets experience, she brings an investment and global markets outlook," it states.
gsk targeted the antidepressant paxil at patients under age 18 when it was approved only for adults, and promoted the drug wellbutrin for uses it was not approved for, including weight loss and treatment of sexual dysfunction, according to a us justice department investigation.
gsk was one of the first major supporters of stand up to cancer.
gsk will pay 24 million up front and as much as 296 million to nabi as part of the deal which will give the company a leading edge in the lucrative smoking cessation market.
gsk's abbas hussain says that this new strategy aims to "build new product portfolios of quality branded medicines which we can combine with gsk's existing extensive sales and marketing."
gsk's crimes may have been serious, but, sad to say, medicine companies pushing unsuitable drugs, manipulating research results and treating doctors to lavish weekends is not new: reprehensible, but hardly a surprise.
gsk, which has invested more than$ 300 million in rts, s to date, has pledged to keep the price as low as possible-just manufacturing costs plus a small return to be reinvested in development of second-generation malaria vaccines or vaccines against other neglected tropical diseases.
gsk, which is apparently subject to more strict internal rules, opted to travel a tortuous route, according to china's allegations: holding fictitious conferences that reimburse doctors 'non-existent travel expenses.
gsk, with its checkered history of corruption scandals, seems to deserve little sympathy.
