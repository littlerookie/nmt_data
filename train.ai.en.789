because you didn't give it a chance.
maybe Nick and Ambar could've been something, maybe not...
but we'll never find out.
Amby! Amby, it's Ron. He's calling on the phone.
what do I do? Come.
I won't ever have to cook?
what?
I won't ever have to cook?
not an omelette, not even a cup of tea.
and separate rooms?
far away from each other.
okay.
so, should we start looking for a house?
Wow! - Control yourself.
let's talk this over first.
I don't trust Indians.
what's that?
babes, what I always say about Indians?
sorry?
exactly. Means, I don't the trust Indians.
hating Jaggu Yadav was, is and always will be very easy.
after migrating from Bihar to Mumbai, it seemed for a while that...
he would never strike it rich.
he kept getting pushed around from one place to the next.
someone suggested going abroad and driving a cab. And so he arrived in Melbourne
then he won the lottery.
his luck took a turn for the better, but his personality stayed the same
hopefully you won't like him too much, because he definitely doesn't like you
but you're Indian yourself, and I was Indian... was.
now, I'm Australian.
get it, mate? - Got it.
there are two kinds of Indians.
babes, what the two kinds of Indians are?
sorry?
exactly. One, the kind you can't trust.
and two, the kind you can't tolerate.
look, we just want to rent your house. We don't want to cause any problems
I see that, I see that. I can see you're okay.
nice, married couple.
married couples I trust.
when did you get married?
soon... - A week ago.
we thought it would happen soon, then a week ago it suddenly happened
quick engagement, instant marriage. And kids?
there wasn't really much time or they would've happened as well
funny guys.
senses of humour. I like that.
come, let me show you the house.
babes.
home the sweets' home.
what?
what are you looking for?
nothing. Just checking to see if it opens.
this is not an Indian public loo where things that are closed don't open and things that are open don't close.
this is Australia mate.
open. Close. Okay, mate?
Where's the other bathroom?
another bathroom... what for?
just in case we have guests over... - No guests.
I do not want any guests in here.
looks here. Just the twos of you.
babes. Tell them how much I hate guests.
sorry?
exactly. Whether you agree or not, no guests.
so, you are wanting the house?
just a second... - No second, only first.
nice house, but this crocodile dundee is making me nervous.
it's not like we have to live with him. Nice rooms. I want the bigger one.
the kitchen's quite cool as well. Let me talk to him.
crap! You scared me.
I have that effect on the peoples. It's my personality.
so, you wanting the house?
well, Okay.
one year's rents in advance.
what?
Translates, read my lips.
I need one year's rent in advance.
babes. Don't I always take the rents in the advance?
sorry?
Exactly! - But why?
short term memories, huh? - Mammaries?
I don't trust Indians.
one year's rent in advance!
does he think his dad owns the place? - Yes, he does
and where will you get the money from? - I encashed my bonds.
what?
Nick, you'd saved that money to start your own restaurant.
I know.
and how is Ambar getting the money? - She's taking a loan against her salary
I hope you guys know what you're doing.
all this is happening so fast... - Are you really saying this?
one afternoon you meet five girls; next morning you've married one of them
and I'm regretting it now. You don't know these girls!
firstly, their logic switch is permanently off.
and if they ever switch it on by mistake, the regulator always stays on zero
but that's true.
Amby, where do you want...
has all the stuff arrived?
everything.
is this... staying up there?
Yes, why?
Ummm... no. It's very nice.
you're right.
I'll put it up in my bedroom.
Nick!
we are moving back together.
are you okay, podgy? - I'm all right, okay
Amby, guess what...
you okay, podgy?
so, she turned her logic switch on? - No, I turned mine off.
thought so. So the divorce is cancelled? - Absolutely. Cancel, cancel, cancel
until when? - Forever.
but still, please keep a room for me. You never know when she'll kick me out
sorry buddy, that's Ambar's room. - What do you mean?
which word didn't you understand, Ambar or room?
I didn't understand anything. Dude! You'll live in separate rooms?
what's he saying in Hindi? Is he laughing at me?
Yes, he's being very rude.
they're living in together but in different rooms. Can you believe it?
Oh podgy podgy, stop it!
you guys can go to your separate rooms, we're going to our single room
all right guys, see you man. Bye.
living separately, can you believe it? Two different rooms! Unbelievable!
today's the first day so you don't have to cook dinner.
wow, thanks boss.
shall we order in?
sure. What do you feel like having? Chinese? Mexican? Indian?
pizza. A nice, hot, crispy, yummy pizza.
my mouth's watering. You don't like pizza?
no, it's not that. I only... - Forget it. Let's get something else.
no, I'm fine with pizza.
I've had pizza. I...
Nick, you don't have to like everything that I do.
but I like pizza.
I owe you three dollars. - You had only one slice, so one dollar.
okay
let's settle accounts on Sunday?
fine.
and this one's my treat.
Wow. Thank you.
what do I get?
one second.
Ambar, meet Romeo. Romeo, meet Ambar.
Oh, Romeo says hi. - Hi Romeo. Where's Juliet?
in my room.
but don't worry Romeo.
nothing will happen between us in your absence.
I don't think he's listening to you. He's checking me out.
I was afraid of that. Oi! Behave yourself.
if Romeo misbehaves with me, it's going to be your fault.
come on Romeo, let's get to know each other. Say good night to Nick.
are you sleeping?
I've got to go to the radio station in the morning.
Oh, okay, I'll clear this up. - Let it be. We'll clear up in the morning.
let me guess, if we don't clean up now, you won't be able to sleep all night?
no, no, nothing like that.
we'll do it in the morning.
where are you going?
if you can tolerate my pizza, I can definitely tolerate cleaning up.
my sister got married when she was eighteen.
by the time she was my age, she had two kids.
I saw her life... housework, cooking, looking after the kids.
weren't you being forced to marry? - Of course... you've graduated now...
all the nice boys will get married... it's our last responsibility.
I got all of that.
you fought with them and came here? - Yes.
four years agoï¼Œdad was very angry.
I think Mom understands, but she doesn't have the courage to speak out
do you talk to them? - Mom calls me on the sly sometimes.
but I haven't heard dad's voice in four years.
I've got only one life Nick. I want to live it for myself.
believe me, I understand.
done. Can I go to sleep now? - Sure.
I hope at least some of our habits match.
they will.
I can't believe you don't like pizza.
I like pizza. Sometimes.
good night.
good night.
you don't need to latch the door.
if I didn't trust you, I wouldn't have agreed to live with you.
good night.
good night.
keep it low.
you'll wake up crocodile dundee.
I swear. What a guy!
and that strange girl who stays with him.
what's that?
sorry?
exactly.
I still think I love you.
tell me in the morning.
stop staring.
sorry.
how come you're up so early? - Thanks to a whole lot of alarms.
Why?
so that I could see you go from the bathroom to the bedroom.
right.
you know something...
you look beautiful.
thank you.
and you smell great.
thank you. Now I'm shy, and I'm going to go to my room.
listen.
have you got ten minutes?
Why?
tell me. Just ten minutes?
Yes.
good. Come with me.
I can't believe you woke up specially to make me breakfast.
breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
you'll eat a proper breakfast every day now.
think about it.
you'll have to get up early every morning. - I'll get used to it.
Oh God I'm really late.
wait.
have you got ten seconds?
I've got to go. Bye!
frustrated yet smiling.
I just don't understand women, yaar!
I mean, if you don't want an answer then why ask the question?
it's unbelievable, yaar! Thrice, thrice I told her.
no, you haven't put on weight! And then she started up again.
say swear, say swear. So I said...
it's okay if you've put on a couple of kilos. Doesn't make a difference to me.
Oh! Wrong answer! - I know, I know
that's where the whole fight began. And then our families got involved.
how?
we started abusing each other's families.
what?
and you won't believe what she did after that.
she bloody started throwing biscuits at me, yaar.
and not the whole packet. She was throwing them one by one aiming each one at me! - Crap! So what did you do?
ate them all. She kept throwing and I kept eating.
what?
I know it sounds funny.
when you're angry it all makes sense.
then? - Then, she ran out of biscuits.
and began crying.
I want to go to my mom's house, I don't love you, I don't want to be here
so I thought it's Thursday night, boys' night out, let her go.
I'll apologize tomorrow. Besides, what would she do here anyway?
you should've called her.
Nick! Boys' night out! You and me are boys!
and I'm married to Cathy. I know, she's not a boy.
hi boys
Hi. What are you doing here?
Why? Nick asked me.
boys' night out, yaar! - She was at Simone's, round the corner.
I said we'll go home together.
Why? Is there a problem?
no. - No, no problem at all, just that...
if I'd known you'd be here, I'd have called Cathy as well for the boy's night out
how was your day? - College was bad.
you want some sushi? - No thanks.
listen, have I put on weight?
put on? I think you need to gain a few kilos.
Really?
good morning.
good morning.
I like.
you're learning how to speak correct English.
when in the Rome, do the Romans. By the way, where the goings?
I'm going to work.
damn goods you work.
I like working women a lot.
babes, what I always say about woman-working?
sorry?
exactly.
you miss the spots there.
sorry?
sorry, sorry! You missed the bloody spots there.
racing!
V for...
victory!
this is my Papa. The whole world calls him RV.
he is the best, best, best pilot de courses in the world!
do you want to know how...
...he became the best, best best pilot de courses in the world?
this is the stadium where Papa began his racing career.
not as a race car driver but as a tyre changer.
Papa's parents died when he was still in school.
he had to drop out and start working.
and so he became a tyre changer in a racing team.
the fastest tyre changer in the world...
...with the biggest dream!
snow White was helped by the seven dwarves ...and Papa was helped by my Mamma.
from a tyre changer, Papa became a pilot de courses...
...after he met mamma.
it's a very funny story!
one day, Papa was going somewhere and...
...as usual he was late. Bad habit!
and Papa has just one. He never plans anything and...
...that's why he's always late.
listen man... - What the hell! Hey you're an Indian!
where do you want to go? - 50th and Broadway but the thing is...
listen, are you fresh off the boat? Just arrived?
in America, the driver sits in the front and...
...the passenger sits at the back.
Papa! I'm seeing hundred dollars for the first time.
...in one and a half months.
the fare from here to Broadway is twenty dollars...
...you can keep the rest... if you let me drive.
when Papa is in a rush he only trusts...
...one person behind the wheel...Himself.
even if it takes...
...100 dollars instead of 20 for that.
do you have a license? - Yes.
okay, hop in then. But drive carefully.
I'm the only cabbie in New York who...
... hasn't received ticket until now.
get it! - Got it!
columbia University, 116th and Broadway.
the cab is occupied, ma'am
what? - I don't have time for this.
cabbie, what are you doing!?
Papa! The cops will catch me.
do you want to spoil my record?
Oh wow!
watch out!
Oh shit!
fantastic!
what are you doing?
he drives superbly!
go ahead, break my record!
look in front!
you are Michael Schumacher himself.
if I had the time I would sue you guys for this.
thanks for the ride buddy.
Hey, I want to talk to you.
Papa!
hey you cabbie!
Wow!
I'm sorry. It's just you're beautiful!
I think I'm in love! I can hear music.
it's my iPod! - Your iPod! - Move!
Oh man!
what's wrong with this now? - Why don't you play it and see?
it keeps on playing, its not stopping!
sister, do you know his value?
fifty dollars! - I'm sorry!
I'm Harry.
and you are? - Thank God!
thank God? Your name is thank god?
is that all?
then I will call you Radhika Shekhar Rai Banerjee...with love.
you can call me anything with love or in anger...
...but right now you need to come with me. Come on!
wait. Wait! Hey wait! - I'm getting late! - Hurry! Come on man.
Coffee!? Music class. - H'asta la vista, sister.
come on. - Okay dude, what's your problem?
come on forget these girls. It's a waste of time and money...
come with Harry. What's your name?
Rajveer Singh! - See! That's why she ignored you.
Rajveer Singh! Not happening! We have to change it.
who gave you the right to change my name?
Saidles? - The racing team!
Oh, Speeding Saddles!
same to same. Hariprasad Dhirubhai Patel...
...team manager. But you can call me Harry for the short.
but your team is...
Yes, it's not doing well. That's why I'm am driving a cab.
whenever a dream is shattered in New York...
...a new cab driver is born.
all the cab drivers that you see here...
...some of them are doctors, IT whiz kids...
...Wall Street Kings, and Hollywood stars.
all of them had a big dream. They became taxi drivers...
...when their dreams were shattered.
but my man, you wait and see...
...Harry will not remain a taxi driver for too long.
ask me why?
Harry, what will you do?
our winning pilot de courses has run away...
...with my thirteenth girlfriend. That's why we're in trouble.
actually I was just kidding! There was no thirteenth.
thirteen is an unlucky number, isn't it?
so I went from twelve directly to fourteen.
but now Speeding Saddles...
...will be back to number one.
that's great! Have you found a new driver?
that's a good joke! R. V! What do you think about RV?
I don't know. I've never seen him. Is he good?
is he good? My brother from another mother!
he is mind blowing!
so that's how Papa met my mamma for the first time.
it wasn't exactly a situation for love at first sight.
but this is New York. There is nothing like ...
...Iove at first sight here.
mamma was learning music in New York.
she is the best, best, best pianist in the world.
Papa teases her for being the arty type.
they weren't the ideal couple.
but believe me, they are. And the proof is Champ and I.
this is Aunty Sasha. She is mama's best friend...
...her classmate and her housemate.
she is all rolled into one.
like speed up.
I'm walking. I can't fly, can I?
why do you become so slow when you're away from the piano?
damn, my iPod!
Yeah, damn your iPod!
I throw it in the dustbin and you pick it up again.
that's not cool!
I bought it just six months back. Why should I throw it away?
then why are you beating it up?
it's not stopping. Some guy ran into me. And dropped it.
a guy! Was he a good looking guy or an ugly one?
he was a nice guy. But he broke my iPod.
repair it after the dinner. We just have...
...one hour to get ready.
what? just one hour? You are an idiot!
why didn't you tell me before? Come on speed up.
no Harry, we already have Danny.
come on Billy, Speeding Saddles...
...Ioose the race because of Danny anyway, right?
not Saidles, Harry. It's Saddles!
same thing. My seventh girlfriend always used to say...
hang on, not the seventh...
the seventh one couldn't speak.
my eighth girlfriend used to say, Harry...
...East or west, never rest until you find the best.
and the best is right there.
best? He is the best at driving taxis.
you Indians are best only at that. A fact is a fact Harry.
a fact is a fact. So let's see who is the best?
let RV and Danny race against each other.
whoever wins will be on the team.
what do you say?
my fourth girlfriend used to say to me...
all right. All right. All right. All right. Let them race.
fantastic!
warming up! Warming up!
wasting time.
come on Danny!
doesn't he know how to brake?
awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!
awesome! Awesome! Where were you till now?
never mind. Now that you're here...
...now everything is going to be... awesome!
my sixth girlfriend always used to say, Harry...
what did she say, Harry?
very deep thought. You won't understand. Forget it.
keep this. 5000, cash. For three races.
if you perform well you will...
...get a contract from Speeding Saddles.
five thousand dollars!
I know it's not much. But may be...
what'll I do with so much?
my tenth girlfriend had slapped me here once.
can you speak a little louder?
what will I do with so much?
okay, got it, got it, got it! - You keep some.
this is yours. Remember, I am the team manager...
...Billy has agreed to restart my salary...
...after seeing your speed.
are you sure? - Yes.
why are you displaying it? Keep it inside.
and listen, always count the money before you take it.
how can I count it before I take it?
you'll learn. You have the lot to learn.
come to the Fast Track store tomorrow...
...with 1000 dollars at 8 o'clock.
not in the morning, right?
what do you think - at night? We need to buy some racing gear...
...and get you a haircut.
what's wrong with my hair?
do you want to become a race driver or a model?
you have to practice at 11 am sharp.
early to bed and early to rise...
don't tell me...your eighth girlfriend?
my papa!
hey stop! Stop!
no, don't stop. What's the matter? Where are you going? - Home.
are you crazy? Now you're going to come with me to celebrate.
celebrate what?
because first, I'm in love. With Radhika Shekhar...
...what was the rest?
ipod. - With Radhika Shekhar Rai Banerjee.
and number two, we're gonna race!
okay, the lady has gone. She's gone.
chapter 1 closed. Chapter 2: Race.
first we need to race & then win the race. Only then can we celebrate.
how can we party before that?
no. No. No. We will party before the race...
...because we got a chance to race.
and we will party after the race because we did race.
win or lose, we will party. Get it?
got it! - Good! Cabbie, downtown please.
and when Papa was planning his party...
mama's party...
...had already started in a very very expensive restaurant.
Beethoven is amazing but Mozart is overrated.
salieri was so much better than him.
they say the secret lies in Vienna's wine.
wine! Why don't I order wine?
I must also say I do know my wines. Allow me.
Stan, I will order wine.
why are you like...let him order the wine.
if I don't do it, he'll start a lecture about wine.
is this the idiot you were trying to hook me up with?
how was I supposed to know he'd be like this?
he looks okay on the surface.
well, now that you're here, have a drink, enjoy...
but not more than two glasses. Okay?
I tried to explain, but she insists.
that's great. I'm totally for the woman's right...
...to be able to order her own wine.
excuse me.
you can't really tell that...
...mama is the daughter of a very very very rich businessman.
this one
mama is mama. She is always very careful about money.
wine is ordered.
mama ordered the wine so that...
...her dull party would become a little exciting.
while Papa's apartment...
...was too small for so much excitement.
his party was rocking!
when papa says friends he means not just his friends but his friends, ...the friends of his friends and...
...the friends of his friends of his friends.
and so on, and so on and so on and so on!
mama always orders the cheapest wine but...
...Papa spends money as if he's the King of New York.
keep the change! Give it to the poor.
What're you doing? Give it to me, I'm poor.
Mr. Manager, Mr. Manager chill! Let him go.
let's party. Let's party!
aunty Sasha had warned mama...
... two glasses of wine and that's it.
but thank God, mama didn't listen.
why are we sitting here like well-behaved kids?
let's dance!
stanley, why do you keep yapping all the time? Can't you dance?
boring! Dance is a very good exercise.
calf muscle! Thigh muscle! Hip muscle!
a dance a day keeps the doctor away.
Radhika, this is not a club. It's a restaurant.
so let's make it one!
they will throw us out of here.
good idea! Let's order some more wine.
then nobody can throw us out!
you've already had three glasses of wine.
Really? - Really.
Radhika! - Can I?
Radhika, no more wine. Okay.
can I go to the toilet, miss?
excuse us boys!
sash baby, chill! I'm not drunk! Excuse me.
now this is rocking!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, again!
Hey, again!
how did you find me?
when did I lose you?
don't you recognize me?
of course I do!
cabbie! - Cabbie! Cabbie, that's right.
you know, I was thinking...
don't you know how to dance? Why do you keep yapping all the time?
Chica! Chica! That's my Chica girl!
ain't nobody get me going better than my Chica girl.
Chica! Chica! That's my Chica girl!
ain't nobody get me going better than my Chica girl.

I'm going to kill you!
mummy! - Rent!
tonight - Now!
broke - Broken bones.
cops!
surgery's not going to help, it's time for the funeral.
Radhika, sometimes you can be like, such a miser!
damn that stupid cabbie!
Hello! How can he sit here without asking?
excuse me, how dare you?
listen, please, I'm in big trouble okay? Just two minutes.
who are you? - Who are you?
me? I am me!
no, not you. Who spoke before you?
that would be me. - Yeah you! Say something.
something.
say something else.
I didn't understand a word.
but your voice is... - Familiar? Yours too!
man, this is crazy!
you guys are making me crazy. Hey, move that magazine.
no. No. No. Please, my landlord is looking for me.
where is he?
white T-shirt, big muscles...
...bald, crazy looking guy.
does he have a tattoo? - Yes, a dragon tattoo.
he's right behind you. Excuse me! - No! No! No!
excuse me! He's right here, behind the magazine. - No, please!
just kidding. He's gone.
really! - Yes. - Are you sure?
Yeah, positive.
hey you!
now that's Magic!
Papa spent all his money on the party.
he didn't save any to pay his rent.
if he had planned ahead then...
...how would he have met mama for the third time?
I love papa and his bad habits.
Radhika Shekhar...what's next?
rai Banerjee, cabbie.
cabbie! - Of course, cabbie! Do you remember...
...you broke my iPod?
fifty dollars.
fifty dollars! That's a pretty cheap iPod.
is he the one?
Yes, I'm the one!
Hey, you were quite rocking in last night.
where did you disappear?
last night...?
last night... fifty dollars.
can you believe it Shona?
shona? - Yeah, it means sweet in Bengali.
Oh really! I of course, don't know Bengali.
I have researched Bengalis in great depth.
banerjee is equal to Bengali. - But I am not equal to Shona.
you're Bengali and you're sweet.
you're Shona. So you are equal to Shona.
so what? Fifty dollars.
Shona, whenever we meet...
you don't have any money.
Yes! Why does that happen?
enough excuses cabbie.
I am not a cabbie. I am a pilot de courses.
you are a liar.
OK, I'll prove it this evening.
come to the race track.
why should I? - Because if you don't, I'll lose.
I'm not coming.
look Shona, after I met you, I got a chance to race...
...for the first time.
and after I met you my iPod broke, for the first time.
you're like my lucky charm!
and you're my unlucky charm.
you're inviting her so lovingly and...
...all she's worried about is her iPod.
forget her. I'll be there.
forget her! Excuse me. Yikes, Harry! I gotta go.
my iPod?
this one's broken. If you want a new one then...
...come to the New York Speedway at 5 o'clock...
...to take your fifty dollars. Bye.
how much time do we have?
we're not going. - But he is so cute!
he's a liar... and a thief.
do you want to be a model or a driver?
this is not a fashion show. Come on...
...concentrate upon the race.
how do I concentrate 'upon' the race?
the fastest drivers in this race are...
...Mighty Mike and Jolting Jack. Remember that.
has Radhika come?
I don't believe this. This is your first race and...
you're worried about that... iPod!
come on! Concentrate upon the race.
okay. Okay. Race! Race! Race!
jacking Jolt and who was the other one, Mickey Mouse?
mighty Mike and Jolting Jack. Hello, look here not there.
let me check if she's here...
Oh My God Harry! So many people! I can't do this!
shut up, you can. Even great sportsmen...
...get nervous looking at such a big crowd.
listen, you look at your car, your steering wheel...
...your steering, the track, look left look right.
look everywhere else but don't look at the crowd.
do you understand? - Shona!
what na? - Radhika!
Hey! - Hi!
I knew you'd come. This is my friend Harry.
Harry you idiot! This is the Romeo you brought here...
...to become a pilot de courses...?
time to go back to being a cabbie.
come on, let's race. Radhika's here.
are you going to race on foot? Get in the car!
RV! RV! RV! RV! Come on, cheer for him.
I've come here to get my fifty dollars.
Yes, but you'll get that only if he wins.
Wow! He looks so hot in red, doesn't he?
RV, if you lose this race then...
chill Bill! From now on Speeding Saddles will always be...
that's my boy.
go win cabbie!
RV, very good. Keep it up!
Overtake!
keep going! Keep going!
Bye-bye!
hey Harry! This is fun.
you fool! What're you doing? We have to change the tyres...
...please come in to the pit.
come on guys, come on!
good job!
bye Harry! - Go! Go. Go. Go. Go!
RV, there's a crash at the second bend.
I know. I can't see anything beyond it.
don't slow down. Take it high and just drive through.
what? Are you sure?
trust me RV! Just close your eyes, keep it to the right...
...and drive through the smoke.
okay Harry!
here we go!
Yes! We did it Harry! We did it!
go!
move to the right of car 56 and overtake him!
hey Harry! What the hell is going on man?
this is welcome to racing!
there's a guy banging into me back here!
What're you doing? This is not...
...a school recess, this is racing.
what the hell is that man? He's been beating the shit out of me!
that's called bump-drafting. - Bump-drafting!
Yes, you can do that! It's allowed. - It's allowed?
yes it's allowed. Now go!
shit! I was running at fourth and now I'm last.
come on RV, this is the last lap!
Hey! - Sorry!
the fender's gone!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
What're you doing? Drive carefully.
it's not my father's car.
okay, now bye!
Yes!
go! Go! Go! Go!

...seems like adoration to you, I wonder why come now, leave it be come on closer to me whisper me some secret of your heart of all the men in all the world
I've chosen you to love if there's just one thing I've wish for
I've wished for you to love in every need with every deed now you're mine, with me for life
I guess you know
I'm crazy for you
I'm walking on air since I've seen you my every second is filled with you my todays and tomorrows too
is that from Tiffany's?
Yes. But how did you know?
50, 000 dollars?
fifty-five - 55, 000 dollars?
man, you're just mind blowing! You actually guessed the price and ...
...the showroom just by seeing it?
you don't even have money to pay the rent...
how the hell did you buy a ring worth 55, 000 dollars?
Shona, my knees are hurting. How long...
...do I have to sit like this holding the ring?
first go and pay the rent. - Right now? I don't have any money.
did you spend it all?
no, not all. I may have about 50-60 dollars.
that's enough for today. - Today... and what will you do tomorrow?
will you sell it?
Never! This is for you. I'll sell the bed.
you're just too much! - Shona, I'm just kidding. Listen,...
...I'm going to sign...
...a sponsorship contract with Aveo tomorrow.
I'll pay the rent as soon as I get the cheque. I promise.
tomorrow, tomorrow. What if this tomorrow of yours never comes?
meanwhile, you've lost what you had in hand today.
but I haven't lost it! It's still in my hand.
so tell me, yes or no?
I can't believe it! I'm stuck with a fool.
Shona! Shona, listen to me. Yes or no?
there's a race in a couple of days...
...that's why he is doing a few extra rounds. Just five minutes more.
practice! Race! More Practice! More race!
he's a very busy man. When does he go to college?
why does he need to go to college?
he's finished with college?
arts or science?
he's never been to college.
you mean... no college degree?
I mean... if he's already so successful, famous and happy...
...then why does he need a degree?
right. What is a degree? Just a piece of paper.
come on pa, don't be so sarcastic.
he's quite popular.
Yes, especially with girls.
aren't you jealous?
I am. Just a little bit. But I trust him.
so did you like the new car?
this car?
Yes. I've just bought it.
if we're going to drive such an expensive car then...
...where are we going to live after we get married?
how can you be so irresponsible?
do you ever worry about how you're spending your money?
cockroach? Worry?
come on RV, get serious.
hey Shona, chill! I don't have to...
...pay the whole amount now. A little now, a little later.
Installments...monthly...
five years! Just chill.
Papa, this is RV. RV, this is my papa...
...Mr. Shubhoshekhar Rai Banerjee.
so I will call you Mr. Shubhosekhar...
...sorry, I mean, Mr. Subho... Shekhar...
...excuse me. I'm very nervous.
can I call you papa, plain and simple? Papa sounds good.
Yes, I like him. - I knew it!
but not so much as to marry him.
who's asking you to marry him?
RV is not the right person for you.
small name. Small stature. I'm not talking money.
I know he's very rich and famous.
I'm talking about his stature here.
he needs to have some sort of an intellect...
...to be your life partner, doesn't he?
he does have an intellect. It's different from yours and mine...
but it's there. - Oh really! Which car dealer did he buy it from?
come on pa!
come on, Radhika. You're majoring in music.
French, Russian, Elizabethan poetry...
...world history, mathematical logic...
...these are your electives.
you've gained your intellect by studying all these subjects.
what has he studied?
sports pages constitute his study of literature.
he knows only enough math so as to...
...calculate horse power.
and as far as foreign languages go...
...he probably knows only one word in Italian...Ferrari.
but I love him and he loves me.
he loves you now. But what about tomorrow?
he'll love me tomorrow as well.
does he ever think about tomorrow?
it's just today's race and today's win for him.
you've always planned for tomorrow.
you were just ten...
...when you decided to become a pianist.
I learnt that from you and it was useful in life.
but to live for the moment...
...and to enjoy it...I've learnt that from RV.
and that will also be useful.
okay, so enjoy this moment with him. I understand.
he's handsome, he's a sportsman and...
...he has also earned some money.
why do you need to marry him?
pa?
let's be frank. I married your mother...
...after a lot of consideration.
but before that I also had...
...dates...flings with a couple of girls.
Flings!
I know ...it sounds cheap. Affair. Have an affair...
...and then forget this RV affair!
enough! Don't insult your son-in-law.
he is not my son-in-law! - He is my husband.
have you gone mad? You're defending him today but...
...tomorrow you'll regret it.
we're getting married tomorrow.
if you come I'll be very happy but if you don't...
... You've taught me this...
...it doesn't matter whether your loved ones hurt you or strangers...
...It's always wise to forget...
...the sorrow and move on.
I can't put into practice every bit of advice you've given me...
...but I will definitely follow this one.
tomorrow morning. 10 am.
could you slow down a little bit?
uncle, start.
do you Radhika Shekhar...
just Radhika is fine.
or Shona. Short and sweet.
short and sweet. - It has to be the full name.
superb uncle! Superb! Come on, move on.
do you take Rajveer Singh...
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Yes, I do. - I do too. Can we kiss now?
patience! The wedding's not over yet.
relax.
do you take Radhika Shekhar...
uncle, the bride hasn't changed.
if you repeat such long names every time...
...both of them will become old. Forward.
sir, she said Radhika's fine, right?
fine. Do you take Radhika as your lawfully wedded wife?
yes I do. - By the power vested in me...
...I now declare you man and wife. - Now the kiss?
Contnue. I'm not looking. My eyes are shut.
the rings!
Harry? - - I forgot!
what?
how could you?
joking! Never fear, Harry is here. Take this.
okay.
I don't think you should be kissing the bride...
... driving at this speed.
you want to get off? Close your eyes. Carry on.
this is our house. The best, best, best house in the world.
because here live RV, Shona, Champ and Princess...
...that's me. A family of four.
so this is how papa became...
...RV the superstar pilote de courses from a tyre changer.
cute story, isn't it? Just like a fairy tale.
take the lead on the second bend.
on the fourth bend you'll be against the wind. - So?
my ninth girlfriend always used to say, Harry, when...
...the wind is in the opposite direction it reduces the speed.
get it! - Got it!
go win cabbie!
go! Go! Go!
go! Go!
it's a hundred-lap race! There are ninety laps to go!
don't burn your tyres. Let them warm up, man!
Harry, I'm not going fast. Everybody else is going slow.
I don't know what it is.
Harry, I am coming into the pit.
number 27 and number 2 are both rookies. They're quite new.
they'll get excited early. Be careful. Do you understand?
you're doing well now. Get it! Go! Go! Go! Champ!
RV, be careful. Rusty, in car number 2 coming up.
let him come. I'm getting bored out here.
it's not a joke RV! He's leveling.
enough RV, stop fooling around.
go RV, go get him!
RV, move from the right.
get back. Back! Back!
champ, stay with Princess.
princess, take care of Champ.
Harry, will he be all right?
of course. He's a fighter.
I know. And he has a lot of fighting to do...
the doctors are saying he may not race again.
they're fools. Don't worry about that. Relax.
I'm not worried for myself. But what will happen when RV finds out?
then you and I will bring him back on the track, right?
right. We will.
come on cabbie, fight.
what?
princess! - What?
why did you bring him into the house?
this is his house too.
no. No Princess this is not his house.
this isn't any dog's house. We don't like dogs!
we don't like dogs.
I love dogs!
they are dirty. They bark and they wag their tails like this.
they're stupid.
they're stupid. Daddy, I don't like dogs.
daddy, please...Bruno will stay with us.
okay, a vote. No. No. Yes. That's 2 nos and one yes...
...we win.
we win! - Doggy out!
that's not fair. Mamma! Mamma!
why are you up so early and making so much noise?
Oh my God!
look at what Princess has brought into the house.
we don't like dogs.
why Champ? - Daddy, why don't we like dogs?
he is so cute. Where did you find him?
we will call him...
no, no! We will not call him anything.
please Shona, we don't like dogs. Say something.
Bruno will stay with us. End of discussion.
he must be hungry. Do you want breakfast?
come on Princess. What shall we feed him?
do you want milk?
chicks, I tell you.
yeah man.
the doctors had declared that...
...RV won't be able to race again.'
but RV has fought his injury with courage over the past one year.
and now he's making a comeback...
...to challenge Rusty Finkelstein.
rusty has maintained his...
...position at number one throughout the year.
the question is, will RV be able to...
...win back his position?
of course. Is that even a question?
will he be able to defeat Rusty Finkelstein?
but experts are of the opinion that...
...Rusty is the only strong contender for this race. - Nonsense!
are you sure you're ready to go back to the race track?
which stupid news channel do you work for?
you think I'm stupid?
well, you asked a dumb question.
are you sure?
of course. I've have been waiting for the past one year.
daddy! - Daddy!
daddy, Champ first, Princess second. - Really?
cheater! Cheater! He didn't eat his cereal.
he threw it in the dustbin. - Wait. - Did not! - Did too!
look stop. Listen. Princess, show me your tongue.
okay now you.
no, I won't. - Why?
it's black. I lied.
RV, don't laugh. - Sorry. Don't cheat. It's very bad.
hey team! - Hey Harry!
hey Champ! Come on I'll show you my latest trick.
okay, ready? Watch.
come on Champ, let's go.
no, I want to learn this trick.
come on I'll teach you two tricks until we get to the gate.
let's go. - Okay Harry! - Me too!
RV, what's the hurry?
okay. Tell me honestly, you are sure?
is it black? It isn't, is it? I'm not lying. I'm sure.
now go to class. Go.
hey cabbie!
shut up! That was for me.
go win cabbie!
going good! Going good! Going good!
all right, how far up is RV?
RV, Rusty is taking the lead from the right.
move from the left.
how many laps left, Harry?
just two more.
okay last lap, RV. Go for it!
he's blocking me Harry. I can't get through.
try RV, try. You can over take him. Come on.
come on RV. Come on.
RV try harder, just 700 metres to go.
come on.
RV, what're you doing?
don't slow down! What are you doing?
I'm fine. I'm fine. Hey... Shona, don't worry.
I lost the race deliberately.
if I'd won after a gap of a year...
...then people would have thought...
...that it was fixed...that RV doesn't ever lose.
watch me. I'm going to break my own record in the next race. Okay?
Hey! We're home! Hi guys!
daddy, Bruno & Champ had a race. And Bruno won.
Bruno is a cheater!
daddy, what happened in your race?
guess what's in my left hand?
a book for me.
wrong!
but that's your right hand!
oops! Guess what's in my right hand?
my car! - - Yes!
Wow! Wow! Wow!
princess, see my car!
champ, see my laptop!
Wow! This is a lovely car.
Hi, I'm Eileen, and I'm...
you're an addict and an alcoholic.
I feel ridiculous.
well...
we have to do things a certain way, Eileen.
that's how it works.
OK.
so what's next?
I want you to read from chapter 5.
and then we can talk about it.
rarely have we seen a person fail " who has thoroughly followed our path ."
those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program.
usually men and woman who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.
that's not us, Eileen.
we're gonna make it.
we're survivors.
I can't do this.
just give it a chance.
give it a chance. We just started, ok?
I felt the same way when I first started.
that's what this thing is all about.
fellowship. Helping each other.
five.
there are such unfortunates.
they are not at fault.
they seem to have been born that way.
they are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner of living.
which demands rigorous honesty.
their chances are less than average.
what's this?
some Hmong kid got chucked off a roof.
dear God.
this neighborhood's going to hell.
it's 'cause no one goes to church anymore.
for God sake, Mary, this has not got to do with going to church.
this has to do with immigration.
foreigners coming in, taking our jobs.
bringing up the drugs from South America and whatnot.
and our boys unemployed, lounging around with nothing to do.
never have I had to step over dead bodies to get my hair done.
Hiya, Patsy.
good morning, ladies.
rose, why don't you start with Javon.
may, come sit.
little excitement this morning?
terrible.
do you know who it is?
the body?
Oh, some hmong oriental drug dealer.
I wonder who killed him.
some of the other orientals. They're like that.
it's just terrible. The drugs are everywhere.
and it's not just strangers who are dying.
you know Mo Shay still hasn't gotten over her Davey's death from that heroin.
we should organize.
organize? -- The neighborhood.
form watch groups, self defense teams.
whoever's selling these drugs.
I'm not sure it's just the Hmongs they need to know we are not going to put up with it.
we could have an organizational meeting.
I know a lot of people who'd be interested -- Absolutely.
we can have it at my house.
Tommy would come.
it's his district, after all.
and Cassie, you could get Declan to come along and speak to us.
I'm sure he could give us some really good tips on self defense?
that sounds great, Rose.
good idea.
yes?
Yeah, you got an Ellis Franklin here?
is he expecting you?
Yeah, I was told to meet him here.
Mr. Franklin.
if this is about your surveillance reports, the answer is no.
no extension.
I want it on my desk by 5 P. M.
it's not.
I've got a guy inside Freddie Cork's organization who's ready to flip.
who?
Really?
he's got cancer and he wants to get right with God.
please.
what's his angle?
immunity and something on the side for his mistress.
done.
bring him in.
we'll talk.
and Giggs.
next time, wear a tie.
did you have a good night last night?
Yeah, sold a bunch of teardrops.
you staying away from that asshole stepholios?
stole his car. -- Dod you?
good for you.
you know, I was on my own by the time I was 12.
I never looked back.
what the fuck is this?
you're $400 short.
cops took it off me on olden street.
Oh, the cops did?
just get the fuck out of here.
Hi.
there's 800.
Where's the rest?
the kid says some cops took it off him.
he's lying.
well, the cops do that kind of shit.
you ok?
what do you mean?
I don't know.
this kid.
he's feeding you a line, an obvious line, and you're just fuckin' swallowing it.
no, I'm not.
he's 14. -- We were 14 once. You remember?
this isn't the first time, is it?
Pete, what the fuck?
some kid takes money out of your pocket, pisses down your leg, and you just take it like some jailhouse bitch?
if I'm that kid, I'm out there right now laughing my ass off.
so I'll take care of the kid, ok?
Yeah, sure. -- Done. Fine.
good.
I'll take the 400 out of your end.
you wanna let some kid punk you, it's your business.
see, I'm starting to question your judgment.
well, don't ok?
please.
there's nothing wrong with my fuckin' judgment.
no, except you decided to donate half our profits to father flanagan's home for fuckin' wayward boys.
Hey, kiddo.
we need to talk.
so, nice to see ya.
dad's girlfriend came to see me.
our dad?
he's threatening to sell ma's house.
how can he do that?
cause they never divorced.
the deed's still in his name.
he took out a bank loan to cover some debts, and if we don't bail him out, the bank's gonna foreclose.
you speak to the bank?
she gave me the papers, I rang the bank, and it's all true.
how much?
more than I got.
don't worry about it.
I'll scrape the cash together. I'll cover it.
I was thinking we should go and see him.
what do you want to see that asshole for?
to make sure he signs over for the house...
and then stab him through the heart with a pen.
Yeah, ma?
Tommy, there's a drug problem on the hill, and I think it's time we did something about it.
well, yeah, What do you have in mind?
well, some of the gals down at Patsy's were talking after that incident today on Tilden.
they want to have a meeting, and I said you would talk to them.
about what?
about the drug problem on the hill, Tommy.
ma, you understand who controls most of the drugs on the hill, don't you?
you and I both know it's those dreadful orientals.
that fellow this morning, he was one of them.
wasn't even from this neighborhood.
maybe that was his problem, ma.
listen...
I gotta go. I gotta get ready.
when you have a date, call Alex and tell him to schedule it, ok?
Thanks, love.
you gonna take the 95 or Hope?
too many stop lights on Hope.
the 95's a parking lot at this hour.
do I even want to know where you got this money?
is it at least real?
fuck you.
well, you know why I'm asking.
I'm know why you're asking.
fuck you.
promise me you won't go hittin' him.
Oh, me?
I'm more worried about you.
I won't touch him.
if I touched him, I'd kill him.
he lives two miles down the road and makes us drive to connecticut?
what's the girlfriend like?
she's what you'd expect.
you think we'll still recognize him?
I will.
if I was blind I could pick that fucker out of a crowd.
my God.
you look just like you do in the papers, son.
I'd recognize you anywhere.
you?
you look the same as the day I left.
I see you both got the sheehan hairline.
that's your mother's fault, you know.
come on.
I want to introduce you to everybody.
Hey, fellas.
these are my sons.
gimme a shot of whiskey.
you sure?
just pour the goddamn drink please.
Pete, it's a mistake.
you don't wanna do this.
you don't wanna go back to -- Tommy, pour me a shot, ok?
I swear to you, I'll pull your fuckin' eyes out.
gimme another one.
8. 50.
how about I sing you a song, Gina, my love?
how about you just pay me 8. 50?
how about I pay you 10 and you give me a kiss?
finish your story.
what story?
is he always this impatient?
only when he's listening to a boring drunk.
all right.
your mother and i were having one of our more spectacular blowouts.
she got it in her head that I was banging Peg Mullen.
were you? -- Don't look so offended.
back then, Peggy was a fine piece of strudel.
anyway, your mother gets on her high horse begging for me to come at her with a knife.
suddenly, Mr. Judd fFtzgerald appears at the door.
and that evil son of a bitch tells me to pack a bag and never come back.
Why?
why did I leave?
no. Why'd he show up in the first place?
for that...
you'll have to ask your mother.
I'm asking you.
but I'm a gentleman, Tommy.
I respect other people's secrets.
give him the papers.
sign 'em. We'll pay off the loan at the bank.
and if you don't care about saving Rose's house...
there.
20, 000 extra incentives.
tie up your business interests here and get the fuck out of Rhode Island.
I don't deserve your hate.
Oh, yes, you do.
what about you?
you hate me, too?
you know...
he was always your mother's favorite.
no matter how many gold stars you brought home your entire future depends on whether your brother decides to be a good boy or not.
no matter how perfect you are he can fuck up your whole apple cart in one instant.
you gonna sign that or not?
and you.
you think you're better than him because you don't hide what you are behind a tie and a snappy smile.
if I were you,
I'd hire Freddie Cork to snap his neck.
then I'd declare for governor the next day.
if you drive me home, I'll sign the fuckin' paper.
Hey, kid.
are you pissing down my leg?
what?
you think you can just take money out of my fuckin' pocket?
what, are you fuckin' loaded?
fuckin' loaded.
am I fuckin' loaded?
am I fuckin' loaded?
trick or treat.
I, uh, I need...
I need to talk.
now?
I'm putting my kids to bed.
please?
can I come in? I need to talk.
are you drunk?
Yeah.
can I come in?
I need...
I need to fuckin' talk.
please?
I can't.
I need some help.
I'll call you later.
there's my baby doll.
my Moira.
these are my sons.
isn't she grand?
I'm covered in bird shit.
Moira keeps cockatoos.
cockatiels.
they're Australian.
she even takes the fuckin' thing in the shower with her.
you been a bad boy, nearly?
Oh, baby, you know I'm only a bad boy with you.
Yeah. How many did you have?
bitch.
when I want a woman to count my drinks, I'll fuck a bartender.
you can go to hell.
and when you're old and crippled and shit your pants, you can wipe your own fuckin' ass.
you're stronger than you used to be.
Yeah. You haven't changed a bit.
you ok? -- I'm fine.
sit down.
you're gonna sign this quitclaim form, dad, right now.
I don't have a pen.
I can't do it.
nothing against you or your mother.
I just can't do it.
sign the form, we pay off your loan, and you get the money.
it's not enough.
paying off the loan won't do it.
I owe another 120, 000 to Luke Palermo.
Luke the hammer?
you saw him at the bar.
big guy looking down on us.
I was supposed to fix a dog race for him.
I had an in with the trainer.
And?
the injection got fucked up.
the dog got a triple dose.
came running out of the gate, started running in circles.
would have been kind of funny except my balls were on the line.
you know what?
I don't care.
Tommy, he'll kill me.
that's your problem.
now sign the form.
sign the form, ok?
Tommy, back off!
no, back off!
fuck you!
and fuck your lying whore cunt mother.
Hey, come on!
outside.
I'll kill him!
I don't want him to live another day.
I'll kill him!
and then what?
go home.
take the car and go home.
what about ma's house? -- I'll get ma's house.
how?
don't worry.
I'll take care of it, kiddo.
go home.
trust me.
come on.
Marty, you want some water or something?
no, I'm ok.
I'm ok.
when did your association with Frederick Cork begin, Mr. Trillo?
he'd hate to hear you call him Frederick.
Yeah.
so...
I met him at the union hall 15, 20 years ago.
we were just friendly.
when did you develop a business association?
late eighties.
vending machines.
and got along pretty well, so we spent more time together.
barbecues...
and family stuff.
and then he supported my run for union president, which I won.
when did Freddie and representative Tom Caffee start doing business together, Mr. Trillo?
I beg your pardon?
simple observation.
Mr. Cork and the representative have been spending a great deal of time together recently.
I want to know when it started.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?
this don't mean nothing.
Freddie's son just died.
Tommy helped him get things straight with the church.
straight how?
look...
this was not part of the deal.
I said I would come in here and talk about Freddie Cork.
I don't know anything about anybody else.
Ellis, can I speak to you outside?
what is it that we're doing?
freddie Cork has ties to Michael Caffee.
Tommy Caffee was never part of the equation.
detective, I have no intention of limiting my investigation because you feel some sort of misguided loyalty to Tom Caffee.
I don't feel any loyalty to him.
it's just I brought Marty Trillo here on the presumption that is was Freddie Cork that we wanted.
you know, I really don't care what you presumed and I didn't promise Mr. Trillo anything.
if Tom Caffee is corrupt, I'm gonna take him down.
Hey, that's a beautiful dog.
this is Molly, right?
Yeah. -- Who the fuck are you?
Hi, Molly.
I'm Neal Caffee's son Michael.
so what is he-- dead, drunk, or in jail?
deeply hurt, actually.
if he promised to fix a race, the race really ought to be fixed, don't you think?
Hey, he's the idiot who fucked up the dosage.
I mean, Jesus, I had to tap dance like crazy just to keep my privileges.
well, it's a good thing you did 'cause you're dealing with me now, and this time you're gonna doit right.
are you nuts?
I can't fuckin' do that.
sure you can.
you just gotta ask yourself one simple question.
do I love my dog?
do you?
do you love this dog?
there he goes.
come on, you 3-legged fuck, move!
let's go! Run! Run!
I gotta have a winner now.
goddamn, you two are walking home if we lose.
come on, you fuckin' hump, let's go, now, go!
I need another win!
what the fuck is this?
bloomin' Molly's looking good for the fifth.
consider Neal Caffee's debt paid in full.
don't take his action again.
if I got promoted at work, it would mean more money and we could finally get a house.
Hey, Maeve, fun's to meet you here.
where else you gonna meet me?
I live here.
Hey, Mary Kate.
Hi, Maeve.
what's for dinner?
I'm making a casserole for the meeting tonight.
what meeting?
you know -- the organizational meeting at Sheila's.
I was supposed to be organizing the meeting.
I guess Sheila just thought you weren't interested.
but you should definitely come.
you, too, Mary Kate.
to tell you the truth.
I don't have the time to sit with a bunch of biddies having a blab-fest when nothing is going to come of it.
Yeah, You're probably right.
I am right.
well...
see you later.
at church, I hope.
when was the last time you saw me in church?
I'm sure Sheila just thought it would be uncomfortable for you because of Michael.
you know, being in that line of work and all.
how dare you.
how dare you suggest that my son had anything to do with those orientals killing each other.
that Maeve.
Jesus.
everyone knows her husband's been having an affair with Conor O'brien for years.
what does she know about anything?
she's just trying to be nice.
nice?
you heard what she was saying.
you should have stood up for your brother.
ma.
listen to me.
family is the only thing that we have in this world.
now, Michael has been very good to you and Jimmy.
you owe him.
Hello?
what are you doing here?
I work here.
you what?
does your mother know?
get your things.
but I have to watch the register.
get your things.
are you here on your own?
Pete's usually here.
I don't know where he is.
all right, that's it.
come on. You're coming with me.
but-- I can't leave the shop empty.
I'm responsible.
what if somebody tries to break in?
then they can rob it and they can burn it to the ground.
you know, I can't believe you lied to me and you lied to your mother.
I didn't lie.
nobody ever asked me what i was doing.
nobody ever asked me.
yeah? What are you thinking?
we need money, so I got a job.
your job, Miss, is staying in school, keeping your grades up and helping your mother run the house.
it is not keeping secrets from us.
no secrets?
no secrets!
then how come mom gets to have secrets?
what are you talking about?
nothing.
no, now that you've shot your mouth off, why don't you finish your thought?
your debt to Palermo's paid off.
I knew you'd come through, Mikey.
you were always my favorite.
you know, that brother of yours -- Shut your mouth.
I'm not finished.
I also paid off the loan to the bank.
sign this...
and you'll get your cash.
you know, son looking at you is like looking in a mirror.
no.
I'm nothing like you.
now sign the fuckin' papers.
sign, little man or I swear before God you will disappear from the face of the earth.
I want you to understand something.
Tommy's made something of himself and I'm not gonna let you drag him down.
you being here, your very existence is a threat to him.
so you're gonna leave.
you're gonna go far, far away.
if you even contact him, or any member of my family again...
u'll see just how much like you I can be...
dad.
he came in here, he was talking shit, he was throwin' stuff around.
he's a mess.
you let him fuckin' drink?
Michael, how am I gonna stop him?
how am I gonna stop him?
he was gonna kill me.
Oh, fuck.
get up.
what are you doin', Mike?
get up!
Mike, I feel like shit.
wait a minute.
what are you doing?
Oh, Mike, what the fuck?
that's not funny, Mike.
I'm not in a funny mood.
what did I tell you?
what did I fuckin' tell you?
if you drank, you'd fuck up and I'd put a bullet in you.
don't disappoint me again.
I won't miss.
you're home early.
I'm gonna be direct with you, and I'd appreciate it if you'd be honest in return.
of course.
are you using drugs?
no, I told you I'm not.
Mary Rose said she found a joint in your coat pocket.
what?
she was looking for money, and she found a joint in your coat pocket.
this has gone too far.
Mary Rose hates me, Tommy.
maybe this is normal teenager stuff.
my mother and I fought plenty, but I never tired to hurt her like this.
OK, so you're saying she's lying?
of course she's lying.
what are you doing?
Mary Rose, get down here right now!
don't do this to her.
Why? If she's lying, she's lying.
what?
right here.
your mother says there was no joint.
that you made it up.
whatever.
what's that supposed to mean?
all right, that's it.
you're grounded.
you don't leave this house except for church, school, and band practice.
you go to your room.
don't.
hello.
what?
slow down. Slow down.
where are you?
just -- Just stay there.
just be right there.
wait. Where you going?
out.
out where?
you going out?
Yeah.
just poppin' over to Tommy's.
give him my best.
will do.
what's eating you?
you try standing on your feet 8 hours a day selling people crap they don't need.
Yeah, well, if it wasn't you, it'd be somebody else.
how's business, Michael?
good.
Yeah, the bar's making money.
even Brink's is starting to break even.
I think people appreciate a fair price, you know?
you make a living at that?
depends what you call a living.
I, for one, live with my mother, so I feel like a king.
don't you patronize me.
I may walk around acting deaf, dumb, and blind, but that's just what is it: An act.
I'm not a fool.
I know what you do, and I don't approve.
I'm not even included in things because of you.
Sheila Watson runs when she sees me coming up the street.
I can't take this anymore.
it shames me.
don't, ma.
ma...
I love you, you know.
are you ok?
there's an a meeting at St. George's at 9: 00.
Hey.
where is everyone?
I don't know.
drunk?
no.
good.
he gave us both to jean, you know.
so he signed the quitclaim.
he won't bother us again.
is that all you have to say?
what?
I stopped by Brink's today.
found my daughter coming out of your storeroom with a box of cigarettes.
so?
she's a hard worker.
got a great head for figures.
she's my kid.
she's mine.
but you don't understand that what you did is so unacceptable she's a lot better off working for me than she would be doing something else.
trust me.
I know she's your kid.
just looking after her.
just stay away from my family.
no, no, Mike.
want to know the truth?
I wish you'd never come back.
great.
the meeting starts at 9: 00?
you can come with me.
I can't, it's too public.
I gotta think about Tommy.
it's anonymous.
I feel like I'm gonna died.
you're not gonna die.
I'sorry about before at the house.
I have some coke.
Oh...
I wanna be loved with inspiration
I wanna be loved starting tonight instead of merely holding conversation oh, hold me tight
I wanna be kissed until I tingle
I wanna be kissed starting tonight embrace me till our heartsbeat intermingle wrong or right
I feel like acting my age
I'm passed the stage of merely turtledovin'
I'm in no mood to resist and I insist that the world owes me a lovin'
I say, baby can't you see I wanna be thrilled?
he grew up working on his father's citrus farm before moving here and starting this company.
he grew up in the tradition of the family farm, and, um, that's how he wanted to run ojai foods.
now obviously, your uncle Saul and your uncle Tommy and I worked here, but dad tried very hard to make everybody who worked here feel like family.
uh, Paige, I don't...
I'm not sure I'm the best person to interview. You know, my-- my own brother fired me from being ojai's lawyer.
uh, well, we're supposed to do an oral history on our family, and I think this is a lot more dramatic than hearing daniel petrova's grandpa talk about his hip replacement.
okay. Well said.
okay, uncle Saul, we'll, uh, we'll start with this.
what does Ojai foods mean to you?
okay, What does Ojai foods mean to me?
well...
I think we're gonna have to do this another time. Okay, sweetheart?
as I look around, I, um, I see some of you I've known since I was a little girl, others since dad gave tommy and me our first summer jobs.
some of you have worked here for over 30 years.
all of you have been so loyal and worked so hard and put so much of yourselves into building this company.
but Ojai foods will be closing its doors for good this week.
I want you to know that, um, that we intend to honor our-- our commitment to you with full severance.
your benefits are fully protected, and we're here to help out with any job assistance that you may need.
you are the heart and the soul of this company.
I am so very sorry.
the employee benefit fund is solid.
they're gonna get paid first.
and then we have the bank loans and the taxes.
and then after that, the vendors, the contractors and the other creditors.
okay, listen, I just want to say that I intend to get every last penny of equity out of this company for you and for the rest of the family.
well, Sarah, that's a very noble goal, but it's totally unrealistic.
I mean, inevitably, there will be pain for everyone.
well, I'm sorry, Saul. I am not prepared to accept that.
okay, Tommy, what's the status on the land sale?
most of the contracts on the real estate are done, and we're negotiating the sale of the winery.
great. Okay.
I have a prospective buyer coming in to tour the building this afternoon.
Oh, I know we have to do it, but it breaks my heart.
okay. What else?
I have a liquidation company coming in.
they're gonna value the furniture and the equipment.
we'll sell the semis, the delivery trucks, the vans.
that will go in the credit column.
but the problem is time. The longer we take, the more money we spend.
right. Kevin's gonna need a few computers and printers.
he volunteered to run the job placement office.
that's fine.
anything else? - no.
okay, then. Let's get to work.
okay, I have a 15-month-old son who's at that stage where he crosses his arms and he sticks out his lower lip and he says "no" to everything.
I mean, I had no idea that motherhood would be so much like the senate.
see? Do you see?
I can't tell a joke.
well, t- try saying it faster.
I am so screwed.
every winning candidate for statewide office, going all the way back to Reagan, has killed at the gold rush dinner.
I can't afford to be less funny than my opponent.
I - I can't afford to go up there and die.
no. Come on. Come on.
we're gonna rally. We have to do this.
no, no, no. - Yeah, yeah.
look, look, now that we've got me sitting next to the attorney general, if you go out there screw up and shame the family, he's never gonna give me a job.
here we go. - Great, great. That's right, kevin.
let's just make it all about you.
Yeah, l-- I'm ready to laugh. Seriously.
go.
Oh, you know, this one actually is-- is probably one of my best.
great.
have you ever noticed how the democrats blame the republicans for everything that goes wrong in this state?
I mean, one of them is sponsoring a new bill to rename the "San Andreas fault" "the republicans' fault."
that is totally a fake laugh. - No, it's not.
it's not fake. - Yes, it is.
don't lie to a dying woman. - Don't say that.
it's probably just the material. - I'm doomed!
um, Mr. Wright? - Yes.
Hi, I'm nora walker.
I - I'm sarah's mother.
she's busy right now...
but I-I could show you around, if that's all right.
I'm sorry to have to meet you under these circumstances.
I run a family operation, too. Both my boys work for me.
so I know this must be hitting you all very hard.
Yes. Thank you. That's very kind of you.
we can take the back stairway here.
this whole neighborhood has changed so much over the past few years.
there used to be nothing here, and now there's so many restaurants and shops and a lot of these buildings are being converted into lofts.
well, that's exactly why I'm here.
Really?
Really?
Oh, I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
uh, this place has been such a big and important part of my family.
well, the idea that other families might move here and-- and be happy...
it just makes selling the place almost bearable.
I'm sorry, but I think you may have the wrong idea.
I own Wright & Sons parking systems.
we build and operate parking structures.
so you're not interested in the building?
no, just the property it sits on.
your daughter didn't tell you? - No, she didn't.
you told him to go away? - Yes, I sent him away, Sarah.
how can you even consider selling the place to someone who just wants to tear it down?
because he made the best offer.
but, Sarah, this building is the only thing left to show that we were ever here, that the company even existed.
how can you sell it to someone who just wants to scrape it off the face of the earth?
you think I want to?
did you even try to find someone else?
what do you think?
of course I did, mom. We are damn lucky we found this guy.
there has to be someone. - It's a building, for god sake.
while it might hold some sentimental value for us, I can't let that keep us from making the right deal.
fine. Then I will find someone to buy the building myself.
fine. You have two days.
so-- so what do you think, Sergio?
they've got experience, they're loyal, the sarah, if it was up to me, I'd hire your entire crew.
but I can't make any more hires until business picks up.
okay, listen. Cut the crap.
your biggest competitor is going out of business.
if you don't start making a lot of money, you're doing something wrong.
I mean, you can at least hire some of our guys.
Sergio, hey. Listen, we appreciate anything you can do, all right?
Thanks, Tommy.
things-- things are a little tough right now.
you know I'd like to help, but the economy is bad right now.
that's-- Stop it.
look, we-- We understand, all right?
and if things change, just keep us in mind, all right?
you got it, tommy. We'll speak to you soon. Bye.
you just let him off the hook.
Sarah, what are you doing? You need to calm down, all right?
you can't single-handedly find jobs for everybody.
we're putting a lot of people out of work, people with families, with mortgages.
I will put as much pressure on as I can.
I understand, but you gotta take it easy on everybody, including yourself.
look, you've already got mom all upset.
Yeah, well, mom seems to care a lot more about bricks and mortar than she does about people.
Sarah, just dial it back, okay?
take a deep breath.
I don't need to worry about you on top of everything else.
Holly, are you sure this is the last of them?
Yeah. I'm sure. Thanks for picking up all the boxes.
Wow. Look at you.
Oh. You like my hair like this?
Oh, you look fantastic.
can you believe I am trying to get a job at another produce company?
listen to me. Maddox thompson is a great place, and they are all going to love you.
I hope so, because I really need a job.
don't worry about it. You're gonna get this job, sweetheart.
when's the last time you called me "sweetheart," when we were dating?
dating.
can you imagine if we had stayed together?
Yeah, you and I in our platonic relationship, snuggled in front of the TV watching old classic movies.
that should've been my first clue.
well, that and our mutual love for Kander and Ebb.
well, there's a lot to be said for good companionship.
I'll say there is. All right. Go ahead.
you're gonna get this job. - Okay. All right.
I'll lock up. - Okay.
listen, Ron. I'm meeting with Stanton tonight.
look, I want to take him down as badly as you do, but I have to wait for him to make me an offer.
I can't just force this.
you guys just gotta be patient.
I gotta go. - Hello!
whoa, you're not going anywhere, right?
no, I'm sorry. Something came up.
no, I need you to stay and laugh at Kitty's jokes.
I thought you hired a joke writer.
Yeah, I did. He wrote six pages.
but she's completely lost her confidence.
so I need a nice audience.
Scotty's coming, but he's a weak laugher.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
everything okay?
Yeah, I just-- I've lost my car keys.
try the side pocket.
you're good. - I know.
that's why you used to pay me the medium bucks. So...
are you off to one of your secret defense department's clandestine black ops espionage meetings?
I'm so deep undercover, that most people are gonna think I'm eating chicken dinner and talking about trade tariffs.
a meeting on trade tariffs just came up?
would you cross-examine someone else? And tell Kitty I said good-bye.
if you were doing something covert or dangerous or unethical, you would tell me, right?
no, I wouldn't.
but I'm not.
so drop it.
thanks for coming in.
we'll be in touch.
Holly harper. - hi.
it's good to see you. - Thanks.
I was sorry to hear about Ojai. - Oh, thanks, Tim.
and it's nice of you to meet with me. - Oh, well, of course.
um, I just feel I should tell you right up front, you are completely overqualified for this position.
well, I just want to try something new, expand my horizons.
all right, then. Well, you want any coffee or anything before we start?
no, no. I'm fine. - Great. Then come on in.
now this is a winner.
a lot of people think I'm running for my husband's senate seat to prove that I'm as good as he is.
actually, we just didn't want to lose the health insurance.
you see? That's hilarious.
no, Kevin. It's terrible. It's absolutely terrible.
Scotty, I-is that funny? - I don't think so.
Scotty. - I'm sorry, but I think these jokes are lame.
I paid good money for these jokes.
this guy's, like, the top hollywood joke writer.
Yeah. Hollywood, florida.
that's funny. - Well, thank you.
Oh, here's one. Oh, this is good.
now that my husband has decided not to run for reelection, he's always asking me to cook his favorite dish.
lame duck soup.
chemotherapy was more amusing than that.
that was funny-- She is funny. Why don't you think she's funny?
Yeah, Kevin. Why don't you think I'm funny?
you are funny, but in a smart-assy type of way. Is that what you want?
you want to stand up at the gold rush and be a smartass?
all right. Fine. I - I'm trying.
I- I really am. It's just that this is not my thing.
okay. Oh, here's one.
Um,"Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama and Mick Jagger - are teaming up at the pebble"-- "Teeing up."
Oh, wait a minute. They're golfing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Oh, this could be good.
okay, we've got the dalai lama, we've got mick jagger.
sorry about the accommodations, but it wouldn't do either one of us any good to be seen together.
I don't know.
are we doing something wrong?
well, you're coming to the end of your term. You're gonna need a job.
and I think I have one for you.
I'm a donor at the Cardwell Institute, and I know that they'd be thrilled to have you.
I can guarantee you $7 million a year.
$7 million?
well, that is generous and conspicuous.
we can direct most of it to an offshore account if you want.
and it's not generous when you consider the good you're gonna do for us.
$7 million doesn't even cover the paper clips on this project.
well, the committee meets next week to approve the contract, and I think I can get the votes. I don't see any real opposition.
and if there is?
I'll take care of it.
and how many applicants did they have?
counting me and my guys, maybe 35.
for two positions? - Yeah.
I waited three hours.
but then they told us they'd filled the jobs, and we should go home.
not a lot of work for drivers right now. - Yeah.
okay, well, I'll-- I'll make some more calls.
maybe we can get you something temporary to tide you over.
okay. Thanks. - No problem.
but, uh, in the meantime, I'll help your crew file for their unemployment benefits, 'cause those checks take a while to come through.
Yeah, I know.
Pedro, I'm so sorry about all of this.
Ah, listen, a lot of people here are worse off than I am.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
Thanks.
So...I, uh, picked you up some yogurt.
but I couldn't remember if you liked double chocolate - or the chocolate chocolate... - Thank you.
so I got you both.
what, is stuff still crazy at Ojai?
Oh, you have no idea.
what is that, your resume?
Yeah. I'm trying to make the two years that I worked for my mom look like a career.
okay, how about this?
Justin, I'm trying to work.
what if I were to say that I have an idea that does not involve a resume?
I'd say I'm listening.
okay, hear me out.
this group on campus is recruiting med students to go to Haiti for a year to help out, and, Rebecca, I think this would be awesome for us.
I- I could go help people that are suffering right now and not in seven years, and, you know, with Ojai closing, you can come with me.
and, you know, you said you wanted to get back into photography, so you could take pictures and-- and sort of document the whole thing, which would then be you helping, too.
there's my sales pitch. So...
it's your turn to talk.
Justin, listen, I know-- I know that medical school wasn't everything that you wanted
Oh, no, no, it's a sabbatical.
I would actually get credit for-- for hands-on experience down there, so the timing of it is perfect.
not all the timing. - What does that mean?
Justin, I want to talk about this, but I-I have, um, a second-round interview for this new job.
second round?
when was I gonna hear about the first round?
apparently, when I heard about Haiti.
Justin, listen...
I- I do love photography and-- and Haiti would be incredible, but...
I like what I'm doing.
this is my career, and let's face it-- A year is a really long time.
how-- how come I feel like you already made up your mind?
Justin, that's not fair. You can't just spring this on me and expect me to...
to say yes immediately. - You know what?
thanks for considering it for all of 20 seconds, Rebecca.
is there anything good about working at Ojai you remember?
okay. Well, you know, I wasn't as close to dad as tommy or your mom was, so I never worked here as a kid.
and I just assumed dad didn't want me to.
anyway, uh, about a month after I got out of law school, he...
he called me and asked me to look over a contract.
a way for him to get free legal advice. I don't know.
but for me...
did it make you happy?
I don't know that I've been so proud before or since.
I know you're trying to do the best you can for your employees, but my answer hasn't changed. I'm sorry.
okay, what if I sweeten the deal? - I'm listening.
would you hire my loaders and my drivers - if I sign over three semis to you? - In a word, yes.
okay, then. We got a deal. Thanks, Sergio. I'll be in touch.
what are you doing here?
you left this morning without breakfas or even saying good-bye.
so it's time for croissant, pot au chocolat, grapes...
a nice little breakfast.
listen, don't-- don't be mad. My stomach's all knotted up.
I can't face the thought of food.
you know on top of everything, my mother is furious at me, because she's gotten all...
sentimental about this building at the worst possible time?
well, with all the change going on, I'm sure she's looking for something solid to hold on to, so...
maybe, but I've got to be practical.
I- I don't have the luxury of getting attached to a building.
anyway, the-- the only thing that really matter to me...
you eating food, okay?
come here.
I don't suppose coffee counts.
no. Sorry.
I can't believe sarah is doing this.
we have to sell the building. We have no choice.
it's like no one else's opinion matters.
Tommy, tommy, do you think getting top dollar should be the only criteria for choosing a buyer?
mom... It's just a building.
it's not just a building.
it's our history.
it's...
it's my...
history.
God, Sarah was just a baby. She wasn't even walking yet.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
plans.
the designer of those plans was Roger Grant.
Yeah, and he lives in london.
no, he's here now. I read it in the "times.
maybe he'll buy the building. You never know.
mom, there's no way he's gonna pay what the parking lot people are offering.
look, the parking lot is not going to happen.
I used to have his cell phone number. I used to have his.
see, look. You don't even have his number.
I slept with the man, for god sakes. I've got his number.
okay, I've got-- All right.
look, mom, just be careful, all right?
Oh, don't be silly. I'm not in the least bit interested in Roger Grant.
I'm talking about sarah.
I've never seen her like this.
mom, maybe this is the wrong time to pick a fight.
I'm not picking a fight.
I'm trying to save a piece of us.
look, Tommy, maybe it isn't important to you or Sarah right now, but someday it might be.
Hello, Roger?
Hi. It's me, Nora.
so imagine it, okay?
right at the top there, the two towers will connect via a skywalk...
a skywalk? - Up on the 70th floor.
Oh, that-- that has got to be one hell of a view.
Yeah, if the permits take any longer, I'll be doing this project from well above that.
Oh, Roger, stop. Don't talk like that. You're not old.
and besides...
anything that good is-- Is worth waiting for.
Yeah.
look, I-I'm sorry I, um, I couldn't do dinner.
it's just that we have to... - It's all right.
fly out this evening...
Kristin and i, and-- ah.
is-- Is-- is that your assistant or someone you're seeing?
Yeah, the-- the latter.
she has us off on this fitness retreat, starting tomorrow.
Yeah, she's the instructor, and it should be great.
why do you look so pained?
well, I...
I feel bad, Nora. I should've mentioned her before.
no. I-i'm the one that should've said something.
I think my being mysterious, might have...might have confused things.
actually, it's......It's Ojai foods.
Roger, we're shutting down. - wow.
I'm sorry about that.
that must be a tremendous loss, I'm sure.
well, I'm so glad you feel that way, because I-I was thinking, our-- our building is one of the first buildings - you ever designed. - Well, the very first.
the first. That's perfect.
I think you're gonna love this idea, Roger. I...
I think you should buy the building.
and then you could keep it-- it safe and protect it from any horrible person wanting to tear it down.
are you kidding? I'd pay someone to do that.
what? - Look, Nora, I'm glad the building has been home to your wonderful business for many years, but it's never gonna make the Roger Grant architectural tour.
I mean, it's just a pastiche of all the other buildings downtown.
I was, you know, I was copying other buildings back then.
the truth is, I'm-- I'm more interested in where I've gotten to.
Oh. Oh, yes.
ahh, yes, yes, yes. I...
I see. You are now into newer, younger...
more modern designs-- Sleek and smooth.
Ah, yes, that's perfectly clear.
you know, I-I had no idea that you'd take my dating a younger woman so personally.
Oh, roger, I don't give a rat's ass about your girlfriend.
it's the disdain you have for your own history that bothers me.
you just want to plaster over all the imperfections in your career, as if you could just botox your whole past away.
look, I don't love my wrinkles and I'm certainly not fond of my neck, but I'm not ashamed of them. They are who I am.
it's a record of the life I've lived.
our building is humble and simple, and I love it.
and I'm just so sorry for you that you don't.
thank you for the coffee. - Pleasure.
I'm Holly Harper, co-president of Ojai foods.
so...
you were my grandfather's girlfriend?
that's not very appropriate. - No, Saul
sorry. - It's okay.
no, Paige, you can did that make it weird to work here?
sometimes.
uh, like now, for instance, but...
Oh, look, look, it's your, uh, aunt rebecca.
Hey, I'm so sorry to interrupt. I just have some really good news.
what is it, sweetie?
okay, you guys are looking at the new associate vice president of Maddox Thompson foods.
I- I-- that's wonderful.
I know. I'm shocked. Apparently, they interviewed a lot of people, too.
w- w-well, why be shocked?
they are lucky to have you.
that's all great. Thank you.
Hey, Pedro. What's up?
great news. We're going over to Sergio Acosta.
all of us-- Starting next week.
that's amazing. What-- This is such great news.
the last I heard, Sergio wasn't hiring at all.
he said he talked to Sarah about us.
you should give him a call. Maybe there's openings for other people.
Yeah, of course. I'm-- I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.
Thanks. I gotta go home and tell my wife.
Yeah, of course.
when we started Ojai foods, your grandfather and I, I was in my 20s.
and aside from a brief stab at retirement, I have spent every day of my working life at Ojai foods.
and it's been a very satisfying job-- You know, giving nourishment ple, feeding them, filling them up.
and I guess if you're lucky enough, it can work both ways.
your job can nourish you, can enrich your life.
and I have been very lucky.
I- I...
I have gotten to work with people that I love.
but there is a danger to it, I suppose.
when you don't have children, when-- when you're single like I am, you can rely on your job to give you more than it actually can.
it becomes so much a part of you, that you...
you can't imagine life without it...
without that place to go to every day.
have you guys seen Rebecca?
Yeah, it was her turn to get interviewed by Paige.
my daughter is making a film of the worst week of my life.
Yeah, you know what? We should do something for Rebecca.
at this point, any good news is reason for celebration.
what good news?
way to go, bro. Spoil the surprise.
you know that job she was up for?
she got it, at Maddox Thompson.
Oh, yeah. Employment's way up.
I just spoke to Sergio Acosta to thank him for hiring Pedro and see if he had any more openings.
why don't you seem happy about that?
Oh, why don't you tell him, Sarah? - I had to do it.
you can't give away company assets.
hold on. What-- What's going on here?
just a little embezzlement by our sister.
Oh, it's not embezzlement. Come on, Kevin.
don't kid yourself.
just 'cause you think it's a good cause, that doesn't make it right or legal.
hold on. What did you give away?
she gave $100, 000 to Sergio Acosta in trucks.
you just gave him company trucks?
he assured me that he would hire our crew.
are you nuts? They don't even belong to you.
no, they belong to the company, and the company failed, and that's why these people are out of work.
so the company can take the damn hit.
I know what I'm doing.
I don't think you have any idea what you're doing.
how are you gonna account for the trucks? They flew away?
I was gonna pay for them myself. - Really? How?
I was gonna sell my house, okay?
Sarah... Listen to yourself.
I mean, you are so far over the line, you don't even see it.
these people are my responsibility.
when you were up in seattle, I had to live with my inability to save this company every day.
and it's not their fault. It is my fault.
it is my fault, and I am trying to fix it.
Sarah. Sarah, stop.
I'm sorry you didn't have your camera with you, Paige.
you could've got the real story about the end of Ojai.
have you ever noticed that the democrats blame the republicansï¼Ÿ
you know, I can pour you one of your own if you'd like.
Oh, yeah, that would be great. As soon as I finish yours.
I swear. I do not know how you do this all the time.
I feel like I actually might vomit.
okay, look, you're just gonna breathe deeply and make sure your knees don't lock.
Hey. Kev, what are you doing?
Kevin, you're-- you're-- You're not dressed.
we have to leave in, like, 30 seconds.
I know. Sarah had a meltdown, and it's pretty bad over there.
well, i-is she okay? I mean, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
is this a-- is this a-- A real meltdown or a sarah meltdown?
I'm saying, I really should get back there.
Yeah. Yeah. No, I- I think that I should come with you.
I think that sarah is really going to need my moral support.
and besides, she likes me a lot better than she likes you. So, um...Robert.
you really think you should blow off the gold rush dinner?
cause I think it's kind of important.
no. It's all about small businesses and family.
I think I have the perfect excuse, and besides, you're...
you're funnier than I am.
I'm sorry. What'd you say?
I said you're funnier than I am. - That's true.
you can use my jokes if you want. - Oh, absolutely.
okay. Let's go.
Oh, god. I hope that isn't a peace offering.
it's me that owes you.
no.
I- I went by the office.
Tommy told me what happened.
I really screwed up, mom.
okay, you made some mistakes.
uh, that's an understatement.
God, who are you think that you're so important and superhuman that you're the only one that could've saved the company?
but I didn't save it, did i? So...
look, I know how badly you feel.
but you push me away, you push Tommy and Kevin away.
it's like you have to suffer alone, like your disappointment is so much worse than ours.
it's not disappointment, mom.
it's shame.
and I failed...
completely.
I am just...
trying to work out how I live with it. - Oh, sweetheart.
sweetheart, I know what failure is.
but as hard as it is...
I think you have to lean into those feelings.
you haven't had much failure in your life, Sarah.
it takes practice to get good at it.
it hurts like holy hell.
but it's important. It's the door that will lead you to your future.
I just don't know how to do that.
that's not who I am.
you see? I'm a failure at failure.
no, honey.
I- I think you're being spectacularly successful at failure.
Oh, mama.
Oh, honey. Oh, sweetheart.
Hey. So I just got off the phone with Maddox Thompson.
they wanted to apologize for not telling me you were up for the same job that I interviewed for.
I know. They called me, too. They were really embarrassed.
mom, this is so unfair. You're ten times more qualified than I am.
I'm not gonna take this knowing that you deserve it.
don't even think about turning that job down.
okay, it stung a little.
but it's a much better fit for you than it would've been for me.
I just feel horrible.
no, sweetie. I will be fine.
and I will find another job.
actually...
the only bright spot in this terrible day is knowing that you're going off on this whole new adventure.
really.
we were cleaning out the old desks the other day, and, uh...
I found this.
Walker and Son fine produce.
I made a bunch of these when I was a kid.
I, uh...went to show dad, and he said that, uh, "that's right" .
someday, it will be.
but unfortunately, he was wrong.
he was right to bring Sarah into the business.
if I hadn't have worked so hard to try to prove him wrong every day, things might be different for, uh...for everybody.
you know, you never told me what was in this box.
because I don't know what is in that box. They gave it to me at the office.
it's from Roger Grant.
Oh, my god.
Sarah, I- I wanted to tell you...
I... I tried to convince him to buy our building.
it didn't work. He was not in the least bit interested.
open it.
some women and some buildings are classic. Thank you for reminding me.
I thought you might enjoy these original drawings.
I did for william when we were all very young.
that's so sweet.
Oh, Sarah.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, look. Ojai foods offices.
Oh, you know, these have all been done by hand. Nobody does this anymore.
Oh. There used to be a clock tower.
Yeah. Oh, William nixed that right away.
he said he didn't want a clock ticking over his head, reminding him how fast the fruit was rotting.
what is this other...
Oh, my god. mom.
dad was gonna build something at narrow lake.
a house.
why the heck didn't he tell me?
because it was... Supposed to be a surprise.
or maybe he wasn't building it for me.
mom, it's an anagram of your name.
of course it was for you.
well, now I am-- I'm really confused.
why would Dennis York want the land where William was gonna build a house?
I have no idea.
look at this-- "Nora's Art Studio,"" Nora's Sewing Room."
over here,"Nora's Bathroom" on the second floor.
I can't believe he was gonna build me a house.
this is more than a house, mom.
this is a love letter.
he really loved you.
you're allowed to lean into those feelings, you know?
Yes.
I guess he did.
nice job out there.
you were very funny.
well, thanks. They're a friendly group.
sorry Kitty couldn't make it tonight. I was looking forward to meeting her.
I think it's best if we keep our relationship to ourselves.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
that's why I was so surprised to hear that you'd been talking to Rawling a lot. What was your plan?
were you taping our conversations?
and who were you reporting to besides Joe Rawling?
you are misinformed.
I'm very thorough when it comes to a $1-billion contract.
my conversation with rawling had nothing to do.
here's the deal.
you walk back your plan with Rawling and you destroy whatever evidence you've collected, or I'll use every ounce of influence I've got to make sure your wife couldn't get elected dog catcher.
good night, senator.
say hello to Kitty for me.
I can't believe they're valuing dad's desk at 30 bucks.
well, look at it.
I don't think it's worth anything to anyone but us.
do you remember that wood burning kit you got me when I was 10?
Yes, I do, because you went around burning your initials into every wooden object you came near.
I was staking my claim early.
you know what, sweetheart? I think that you should have this desk.
your father would've wanted you to.
Hey. - hey.
Hi. W- what about your event?
Oh, I decided to let Robert cover for me. I-is Sarah here?
she's on her way. - Is she okay?
no, but I think she will be.
come here. Look at you.
Oh, hi. - Oh, you, you look gorgeous.
God, this is such an amazing space.
someone could renovate it and turn it into lofts.
Oh, honey, honey, um, could you please shut up?
Oh-- That's all right. That's all right.
I'm-- I'm reconciled.
I'm glad you came back. I wanted to talk to you about something.
if this is about you getting that new job, I already know.
And? And we gotta figure this out.
because this is serious.
I- I feel like we're miles apart in where we want to be with our lives, Rebecca.
I didn't even know you were interested in this job.
you don't even know what the job is.
okay. Well, tell me about it.
is everything okay with you two?
uh, yeah, yeah. It's fine.
Oh, my god. W-what...
what happened to your dinner?
Oh, I just decided to take pity on the audience and let Robert cover for me.
we just all wanted to be here.
well, um, I-I'm glad you are all here because, um, you know, there's a couple of things that I've-- I've wanted to say.
um, the first is, I hope you can all forgive me.
you have to stop.
Sarah, come on. - Okay, okay.
uh, well, second is, we all know dad was an irish whiskey man.
I always kept a bottle at the house in case he stopped by.
I'm kind of hoping that you could help me finish it.
that's a great idea! - mom!
okay.
that is something I'm actually good at.
uh, cups, cups. - Choppy-choppy, get the cups.
you know, um, I still have to fix up that whole truck mess.
no, no, you don't. I spoke with Pedro this afternoon.
Oh, god. I've gotta call him and apologize.
no, you don't, at all, because...
he actually wants to buy the trucks himself.
he and his brother, they want to go into business.
and, you know, they want to take some of the crew with them, so I showed 'em how to get a small business loan...
yeah? - And they're ecstatic.
Kevin, that's wonderful.
great symmetry, right?
one family business closes, another one opens.
Wow. That story actually makes me want to cry.
to capitalism.
I know what we should be drinking to.
come on, Sarah.
no, I think you should do it, uncle Saul.
to Ojai.
to Ojai.
to Ojai.
Wow. This is a first.
what?
this family speechless.
of all the money? that e'er I had?
I spent it ? in good company?
and all the harm that ever I've done?
alas it was to none but me?
and all I've done for want of wit?
to memory now, I can't recall?
good night and joy be with you all?
that I should go? and you should not?
I gently rise?
and softly call?
good night and joy be with you all?
and so it falls unto my lot?
that I should go?
and you should not?
good night and joy be with you all.
good night, Ojai foods.
and all I've done for want of wit?
to memory now, I can't recall?
I'm amber. I'm your new intern.
you slept with her.
you need $12 million to put back in the fund by the end of the year.
where are we gonna find $12 million?
we find out where dad put it.
somebody has to know where that money is.
I can refer you to a forensic accountant.
if you wanna leave, nora.
why, just because my brother is over there with the woman who was sleeping with my husband?
for a long time, I didn't know about you and william.
so many secrets he only shared with you.
Hey, boss.
we used to know each other. San marino high.
I like you. And I feel completely and totally out of my league.
the hardest thing is knowing when to give up.
he's gone.
it's tantric.
it's exactly like... it is yoga.
please don't talk. Don't move.
if you move, something really bad could happen.
like what? - Don't talk! Just hold it.
Oh, my god, I'm gonna pull a hamstring.
this is the most uncomfortable position ever.
I promised one of my T. T.C. Friends I'd try it.
you have to move. This......
get off. Move. Aah!
okay. Oh!
Oh, julia, there's gotta be an easier way to make a baby.
God.
what's T. T.C.Anyway?
trying to conceive. It's online.
and this is what you talk about in your chat rooms?
with strangers? Do I need to put a block on the computer?
ready for round two?
actually, no. We don't have any time. We gotta go.
we gotta get over to sarah's.
you're not going anywhere.
dude, thanks for coming.
sorry. Sorry we're late, everyone. - Okay, come on.
we don't have much time to take control of the situation.
and we have to stick together. That's the most important thing.
we should go on a road trip and, like, vanish into thdesert.
Yeah, for a year, which is how long it'll take for mom to stop being mad at us.
no, we have to stop this now, or it will go on for the rest of our lives.
what is the big deal?
this is a benefit for the pasadena children's hospital, for god's sake.
it's not the cause that's the problem. It's mom.
and the night is staggeringly long.
we have to be this nauseatingly perfect, smiling family.
it's, like, 4:00 in the morning. It's awful.
you're lucky you haven't been to one of these.
just talk to her, guys. Tell her you don't want to go this year.
I agree. What's the worst that can happen?
do you know what a war crimes tribunal looks like?
I had to go to war to get out of it.
she practically called the white house to get me back for the night.
look, sarah's right. We stick together, we're fine.
but if anybody cracks, we're sunk.
you know, I was kind of looking forward to it this year.
you know, the theme is back to broadway, and who doesn't love a musical?
you are gay. - so?
listen, no one is going to this thing.
the company has to foot the bill, and we can't afford it.
we just can't be throwing money around right now.
okay, so I'm gonna tell mom.
all you guys have to do is hold your ground.
the tyranny of nora's big night is over.
Cheers. - Cheers.
okay. - Cheers.
what do you think the chances are that I'm gonna end up living with mom and 18 orange cats for the rest of my life?
3 to 1.
so this, uh, thing that you were talking about, about how the company is paying for the benefit and not...
Teah. Look, times are tough.
we've had to make some big decisions, sell off a few divisions.
a few divisions? Wow.
well, that would be tough times.
Yeah. It was all stuff dad was preparing to do.
he just... never got around to it.
well, is the company gonna be okay?
it won't be the company we grew up with, but it will be fine.
listen, I need to be the one to tell mom, okay?
when I do, she'll understand why it's best if we don't go to this ridiculous fund-raiser thing this year.
these...
financial problems that you're talking about... did...
did they have anything to do with dad?
they're not his fault, if that's what you mean.
okay. Well, I gotta go.
let me know how it goes with mom.
good night. - Night, babe.
thanks for the pizza. - You're welcome. Drive safe, huh?
good night. Thanks.
don't.
you should have told her.
Yeah. "Hey, sis."
you know your father, who you worshipped and adored and still preach about on national television?
well, not only was he an adulterer, "he was also an embezzler who stole millions of dollars "from his employees who worked tirelessly to make him rich in the first place.
something like that?
Yeah.
we're running out of time.
finding a replacement master of ceremonies 48 hours before the event-- it's gonna be impossible.
I have a secret weapon I can tap-- a celebrity who's on tv. Ooh.
your entire brood is coming this year, hmm?
Kitty no longer has 3, 000 miles as an excuse.
for the first time, all five of my children will be there.
that's why we do it-- for the kids, right?
uh... would anyone else like some more coffee?
I'm in desperate need of caffeine.
Harry, your assistance is required in the kitchen.
you're doing well, aren't you?
I heard you already started dating.
what was that? Was that supposed to be charming, huh?
was I supposed to melt when you put your hand on my thigh like that, or just enjoy it so much I would forget you're married to my friend, who happens to be sitting across the table from us?
I just thought... - I doubt that, harry.
and if you did, you thought very, very, very wrong.
Oh, I guess I just misinterpreted a signal.
signal? I sent no signal, harry. None.
and I did not go out on a date.
the only resemblance it had to a date was how disastrous it was.
darling, nora, is the coffee ready?
coffee's ready.
so I studied the records you sent me.
william walker sold his stock to the company pension fund at an inflated price of $15 million.
the proceeds from that sale went into his personal bank account for less than 24 hours.
right, and then the money was wired out.
I can never find out where, leaving us at a dead end.
because you're not a forensic accountant.
the routing number on the outgoing wire transfer is registered to prescott national.
now that's a bank in nevada.
so does william have an account there?
no. The money went into an account held by ricklean & cabot.
it's a small brokerage firm in prescott.
so let me guess. Nobody at ricklean & cabot knows anything about william, or if they do, they're not talking.
the best that I could do was determine the number of the account at R&C.
that's it there.
now they've got a web site so clients can view the accounts remotely.
unfortunately, the trail stops at a password between five and eight characters long with over a billion possible combinations.
in other words.
in other words, the odds of you ever seeing that money again are dependent upon one thing, mr. Holden.
what's that?
how well did you know your brother-in-law?
the man fondled me under the table.
are you sure he didn't graze you?
cows graze. This was a millimeter from heavy petting, and what have I done to make every member of this family think I'm a psychosexual hysteric?
apart from misinterpreting a dinner invitation from an employee as a date?
you can't listen to kitty.
republicans don't share a close relationship with the truth.
okay, where's the ad for the program?
I have the printer saving an entire page for ojai.
actually, mom, ojai's what I want to talk to you about.
it's sensitive.
Sarah, I'm your mother.
there is nothing you could tell me I wouldn't take completely in stride.
like when kitty told you she wanted to campaign for reagan?
that's different. She was 12. It was a security issue.
just tell me.
uh, okay.
um, money's tight.
sacrifices need to be made.
well, I know $25, 000 a table is very extravagant, but it's an extremely good cause.
actually, mom, it's, um...
no... - It's.
listen to me now.
I know that you and your brothers would rather hammer nails into your foreheads...
than go to this every year, and every year I exert my maternal pressure to get you to go.
and do you know why? - Sadism?
Sarah, please. Please, just listen to me.
okay.
one night every year, I get to play out this secret fantasy of mine.
I get to look at you all, this perfectly imperfect family that we are, all dressed up and beautiful, and I get to pretend we're that great american family, our own version of the kennedys.
you know how that ended, right?
all right, it's a dumb fantasy.
okay. But it's my fantasy, and I don't know...
with everything that's happened this year, I just, I just need it.
$25, 000 for the table?
well, last year the company gave $30, 000.
I was thinking $40, 000 this year.
$35, 000, not $40, 000.
$35, 000 is good.
Tommy. - Hey.
how are you, doc? Sorry to keep you waiting.
Yeah.
Hey, why did you need to see me in person?
is everything okay?
please have a seat.
when you came in here for your routine physical and requested we take a semen sample, what was your reason?
what do you mean?
I just wondered if there were symptoms, and you were hesitant to tell us.
a lot of the time, men don't like to talk about it.
we want to have a baby.
I figured we have sex... A lot, and I thought it would have taken by now.
so before I go ask julia if she can get tested,
I just--I wanted to make sure it wasn't me, you know?
as it happens, tommy, your body isn't producing any sperm.
there's no easy way to say this, tommy.
you're sterile.
and you have lost the interest of an entire nation.
so that's why I can't get a date.
you let him rattle you too much.
Oh. Right, yeah. Thanks.
don't be sarcastic.
sarcasm is the refuge for people who know they are wrong and are on the ropes.
I'm not on the ropes, mother.
we have to go shopping. You need a dress for the benefit.
Oh, you know, I have to get to work in a half an hour, and I don't need a dress, because I'm not going to the benefit.
Oh, mother, please don't look at me like I just confessed to a killing spree.
nobody is going to the event. Nobody. We all...
all of your brothers and sisters have confirmed.
they did?
Sarah did? She did?
she was the first one. She bought the table.
Kitty, listen to me.
if you are going to insist upon being this antisocial, nonparticipating, sad person all the time, people will think you're aloof.
Sarah, mom totally nailed me. Whatever happened to sticking together?
I am so sorry.
I just--it--it was so hard.
she--she started going on about the kennedys, and it was all over.
Oh, she did not use that kennedy fantasy on you.
and you fell for it. You schmuck.
she's used that before? Oh, god, she's good.
you know what? You're gonna help me find a dress.
and, you know, I'm tempted to make the company pay for it.
no, you won't. - Yes, I wi.
Tommy, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, saul, you have to sit with mom tomorrow night.
you're the only person who can handle her at this thing.
well, I won't be
Oh, no, you cannot get out of this, okay? It is your brotherly duty.
Yeah, well, I'll be sitting at a different table this year.
no, don't tell me.
I have asked holly harper to attend, and I will forgo your editorial.
editorial?
saul, you're dating my father's mistress.
I can't imagine she's worth it.
I happen to believe that she is very much worth it.
and it's not just that you're smart. You're cool.
boy, that thing on the geneva convention in a moral universe?
she's right, war. You skewered kitty like a piece of chicken.
I'm sorry. Hello. Hi. It's kitty.
Hey, how are you? - Did you say,"piece of chicken"?
I meant a tough... insightful chicken.
I have to go do the, um... something.
I thought you were both fantastic.
have a great weekend, kitty.
you, too.
actually, I was looking for you.
I was, uh--I was looking for you, too.
Really? - Yeah.
do you want to go first? - No, I think you should.
okay. Um, are you free tomorrow night?
well, there's this event that my mother is organizing.
it's--it's dreadful. It's full of old-moneyed people
and you want me to work the door?
no, I want you to come with me.
as in "be your date"?
as in a platonic, no-hand-on-my-knee.
I'll-open-my-own-door placeholder kind of date, but yes, my date nonetheless.
wouldn't be appropriate.
I'm sorry. Did you just say that it wouldn't be appropriate?
I've started seeing someone.
Really? Oh, wow.
well, the point is, even if we went and had a good time, I wouldn't be able to sleep with you.
Oh, no. No, that's not the point, warren, because I didn't ask you to sleep with me.
I just asked you to a stupid benefit.
and you know what? I take it back.
Hey, how are ya?
we are gonna rock the house, girlfriend!
you know, it's--it's kind of stuffy and--and pretentious, but, um, the drinks are free, and, um, it's--it's an excuse to dress up.
sadly, I can't. I am...
I'm actually working that event.
you're kidding. - I wish I were.
well, can--can you get someone to fill in?
it's not that. It's--it's kind of a lot of money, kevin.
Oh, okay. How much do you make on a night like that,$200, 300 max?
you know, I-I could reimburse you for lost wages.
I'm starting to feel a little insulted.
Oh, c--oh, come on. That's--that's not why...
you know, it's--it's just, it's kind of a big deal for me, you know?
my whole family will be there, and I would...
I would like to have you sitting next to me, you know, not serving ahi on toast.
now I'm officially insulted. - Oh, stop being so
stop being so what? You offered to pay me to be your date.
it's not even your primary job, scotty.
whether it's my day job or my night job doesn't matter.
I-I'm a cater waiter. You're going out with a cater waiter, and unlike you,
I actually take it seriously.
Paige, Cooper, I'll be right back.
don't do that! Ow! Stop it! I had that first!
are you kids all right? - Fine. Sorry, grandma.
Hi. Hey, nora. Wow, you look great.
Thanks.
they give you much trouble?
no. I like it when they destroy things.
it reminds me not to be too attached to material objects.
has it been that bad?
they're my grandkids. I don't care if they take the roof off.
appreciate it. Going rate for a sitter's $20 an hour.
look, joe, anything I can do to help.
Sarah told me about the money issues.
well, if aone can keep Ojai out of bankruptcy, it's your daughter.
bankruptcy?
Yeah. I... thought when
what's going on, Joe?
I think that you should wait to hear from sarah.
whatever you're afraid of sarah doing to you, I'm her moer.
it stands to reason I'm the one who taught her how.
how bad is it?
It'sretty bad.
payday.
the sun's shining, and I'm here for my moola.
see what happens when you show up to work sober?
uh, listen, I have to go to this crazy family benefit thing tonight.
sorry. You're on the schedule. You're working, dude.
uh, julian's covering for me.
then why'd you bring it up?
I was wondering if, uh, you know, now that I'm, like, a little less of a bonehead, if maybe you found me more attractive?
is that your way of asking me to go with you?
maybe.
no, look, they have-- they have great food, and it's kind of weird and cool.
this is sort of last-minute, justin, and I don't...
wait, you're the boss. I mean, you're the man.
you can take off whenever you want, right?
is it super formal?
no, it's L. A. Nothing is formal. I mean, you'd look great in a toga.
you'd look really great in a toga.
look, it's for a great cause. I mean, it's a kids' hospital.
it'll be rockin'.
it's a date.
great. Um, so I'll, uh, I'll pick you up at 7: 00.
write the check. Everyone else has stepped up.
do you want me to tell the committee you're tapped out because you bought a picnic boat?
$25, 000. Yes. Yes.
Ah. Yore the best, carla. Thank you.
does anybody ever tell you to bugger off?
we have to talk. - You hate the dress?
it's about Ojai.
something horrible is going on with the company, and sarah is afraid to discuss it with me.
how did you know? - How did you know?
and why am I the very last person in this family to find out everything?
well, because, mother, you're so chill.
look, money is tight, and they're maybe gonna sell one of the divisions or something, but I talked to sarah, and everything is gonna be fine.
Joe made it sound a whole lot worse than that.
Joe told you?
he let it slip, but I can't get him into trouble.
so you have got to talk to sarah and find out what's going on and get her to come to me.
remind her how understanding I can be.
what?
Wow. Somebody went shopping.
all right, before you look at the price tags, I want you to know, I'm not keeping them both.
so?
what do you think?
it's fine, just like the other six black dresses in your closet.
are you gonna be like this all night?
it's just one evening, and it's really important to your mother.
unzip me, please.
I thought of a name today-- henry.
Henry william. What do you think?
it could be rough on a girl.
girls' names are harder.
even the classics sound so trendy.
I want something unique, maybe something with an "n" for your mother.
what is it?
you look gorgeous, that's all.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
Oh, hi. Oh.
Hi, joe. How are you? - Oh, gorgeous.
so, sarah, real quick, I've been trying to call you all day.
mom told me that the company is in real trouble.
she what? - Yeah, apparently, Joe told her.
Joe told her what?
well, he didn't mean to. He didn't know that you hadn't spoken to her yet, and you can't be mad at him. You just--no, let's...
Hi. Amber. Wow.
Kitty, this is so exciting.
Yeahï¼Œno, it is. It--it is exciting.
what are you doing here? Are you bringing me research or something?
you're so funny, kitty. No, I was asked at the last second.
Well--asked? Asked by whom?
Oh, um
Oh, hello, kitty. You look wonderful.
Oh--thanks. Thanks, warren.
Warren. Warren, thank you. Thank you.
thank you so much.
uh, why are you thanking him, and why are you kissing him?
Howie mandel dropped out yesterday.
I had to ask warren to be our emcee, and he stepped in like the white knight that he is.
really. - Oh, that's great. Okay.
Oh, look at my children. You look so beautiful.
I think it's time.
shall we make our entrance?
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 20th annual pasadena children's hospital fund benefit.
I am your emcee warren salter, and even though I play a pundit on tv, tonight we are here not for politics, but for the children.
"for the children"? That would explain why he brought one.
last year, Nora walker and her tireless team of volunteers...
look at it all. We did it.
over $200, 000.
I'll talk to you later.
Kevin, scotty's here. He's working. You should talk to him.
Yes, I will. Thank you, mom. Excuse me.
but tonight we plan on doubling...
you have to get your sister to talk to me.
no, I am not doing you any more favors, mom.
how could you ask that man to host? How could you do such a thing?
I had no choice.
he's the only d-level celebrity I know, other than you, with all due respect.
honey, you can't be mad at people for who they bring to this.
it's such a great cause.
Hi. Ah, you look so pretty.
Hello, nora, kitty.
you both look so stunning this evening.
let's go back to broadway.
Oh. Time to sit already. Well, I don't want to be rude.
all right. Well, I'm sure we'll see you later, hmm?
Oh, well, mother, you can't be mad at people for who they bring to this.
it's--it's such a great cause.
no...
please tell me you didn't-- justin.
Justin, it's a black-and-white ball.
are you color-blind, or just a total moron?
I can't stay here. Take me home now, please.
wait. Wait a second.
we're sitting at the "wicked" table.
I'm in green.
they'll think I'm the wicked witch of the west.
Just--wait. Just don't worry, okay?
here. Put this on.
nice move. Did you see that in some movie?
Yeah. The one where the guy gets the girl.
they look hungry at Camelot.
could we please talk for a second?
I'm actually working right now, and you don't want to get caught talking to the help.
okay, you're still mad. I get it.
Yeah, well, at the moment I have to make sure that everyone at "pippin" gets their drinks.
we'll talk about it later. Okay?
well, can I have o?
I'm not your waiter. Get it yourself.
I can't believe you told mom.
all I know is you told me you were going to tell her.
well, one might be more careful when one causally drops a word like "bankruptcy."
Sarah, you know, you have got to talk to mom.
Kitty, it's not that simple.
Oh, goody. There you are, kitty. Warren said we're dining with you.
Oh! Oh, that's great. That's great.
you know, you could-- yeah, there's a seat right over there for you.
did she just say "goody"? - Yeah.
Hey, everybody. - Hi.
Oh, julia, you look beautiful.
Hey, everyone, this is Tyler. She's my boss.
but tonight I'm just his inappropriately dressed date.
no, don't tell me-- someone forgot to tell you it was a black-and-white event?
Oh, kevin, did you see that scotty's here?
Yeah, I know. I know. Thank you.
Oh, no, I better not.
you sure? You may need it for the live auction.
uh, is there something you guys want to tell us?
no. Not yet. - Honey.
have you guys finally decided to start trying?
I'm hoping to be pregnant by christmas.
you know, paige was asking for a cousin just last week.
Really?
this is wonderful news. Wonderful.
I think it calls for a toast.
everyone, please raise your glasses.
to tommy and julia, who are finally going to start to fulfill their end of the bargain and give me lots of beautiful grandchildren.
to tommy and julia. - cheers.
Yeah, cheers. I gotta--I gotta go to the bathroom.
okay.
you must be Mrs. Walker. I've heard so many great things about you.
from kitty? - No. Warren.
uh, amber, you want to... dance?
sure. I love old music.
where did amber just go?
Oh, you know, they just opened up the kids' buffet.
Mm-hmm. That's funny. Come on.
if you're going to insult me, at least do it on the dance floor.
well, I can do that.
look, I know we barely know each other.
but could you--could you please be honest with me?
sure. I'm a bad liar anyway.
if you were kind of dating this guy, and he said he would pay for you not to come as a catering waiter to this event tonight but as his date, is--is that so bad?
Yes.
okay. Let me rephrase that. If a guy you were kind of dating...
you can't buy someone's time.
it's all tied to pride and the work ethic, like sigmund freud said.
what did freud say?
he said,"love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness."
Wow. Do people underestimate you a lot?
goes with the hair.
Yeah, I mean, I just met her, mom. She's my boss.
so are you having fun? You seem a little-- you all right?
Yeah. - May I cut in?
no, I'm so sorry, Harry. I'm trying to catch up with my son.
we're all caught up. Go for it, Mr. P. Enjoy.
Harry, I'm telling you, if you make a fool out of me, I'll cut your nuts off.
I think we should try something.
Oh, what would that be, a menage?
no. It's called a truce.
Ugh. When did she happen? Wh--how did she happen?
I know she's younger
no "er." Drop the "er."
Ugh. I can't believe I broke up with him.
I ended an engagement only to find out that you're dating malibu barbie.
you broke up with jonathan because of what was wrongwith you two, not because of what was right with us.
don't spin it now that you're available and I'm not.
Oh, okay. You're right.
I am?
Yes. And I'm sorry. - You are?
is it that hard to believe that I have the capacity to acknowledge that I might be wrong about something?
do you want me to awer that?
no. I just want you to keep on dancing.
I've been looking for you.
Hey, sorry. I just--I was getting claustrophobic.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
I just--having a baby is all I think about.
I thought you'd feel more comfortable if you saw your family's reaction.
you're just not ready, are you?
is that what you think, jules?
I want this baby so bad.
c-can we--can we go somewhere more private?
Yeah.
you have no idea how badly I wish I could fix this, do something.
how long have you known?
since yesterday.
look, I am so sorry I let you down. I'm sorr oh. It's not your fault.
having children with you would make me the happiest woman in the world, but I don't care how we have them.
God, I love you. - I love you.
Tommy? - Yeah?
what are you doing?
so it was a bad idea, offering to pay?
not if the person you offered to pay is a hooker.
Yeah, you're right.
Oh, uh,"la bamba" is my cue to leave any dance floor immediately.
sorry. Go, twinkle toes.
I think your brother is getting very drunk.
I know, and it's so cool it's not me, right?
Whoa! Not too bad.
Harry, I've really gotta go. I've--I've got, um...
I don't think your sister is happy.
well, give her time.
no, I-I don't mean it that way.
she looks... afraid... for her life.
she's dancing with harry packer.
she should be.
Oh! Harry--harry, you're on thin ice, and you're jumping up and down.
Ooh, I like it when you're stern with me, nora.
Ooh! Harry!
Margaret, I'm so sorry you had to witness that.
so am I.
one of my very best friends, making a pass at my husband.
Margaret, I can explain this.
shut up, harry. We're going home.
uh, margaret.
I defended you. Illana sparrow told me...
no, she said that without a doubt, you'd go after someone else's husband before christmas.
what? - I just didn't think it'd be mine.
mom - Oh, god, nora.
like mother, like son. No sense of decency.
is that my mink?
I hope that's not because they
no, no, no. Please, don't be silly.
you look gorgeous.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
I'm goa go powder my nose. - Who's that?
is that your daughter? - Yeah.
what's her name again? - Her na is becky.
Becky, that's right. Becky.
she's in college, right?
she was, but, uh, she is now doing an independent study, if you know what I mean.
beautiful.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
darn it. Have you got a bobby pin? I thought I put one in here.
sorry.
Ohh. It would take more than a bobby pin to fix this evening.
have you got children?
four of them, all grown now.
well, so are mine. But not tonight, they're not. No, no, no.
tonight, they're not grown. They're monsters, that's what they are.
and you want to know why? Because their father was a fornicating cheat who kept a harlot for years, and now they're furious. You want to know what else?
the fornicatress is amongst us tonight, brought by my brother. How do you like that?
my brother married my sister-in-law after she had married my uncle, and they all ended up in jail in galisteo, new mexico, for selling the mushrooms.
Nora. Here.
if you're really in a pinch, you won't mind sharing.
Oh, I think I've shared quite enough with you already.
I don't know what the etiquette is in our situation, but at what point am I allowed to be rude back?
you'll forgive me if I don't know what to do about you.
well, stop seeing me as the woman who slept with your husband.
and what, start seeing you as the woman who is manipulating the affections of my brother?
don't you want your brother to be happy?
the sad thing is, nora, neither one of us really got what we wanted.
and next up, the big-ticket item
a family vacation for eight to new zealand, so go ahead and outbid your friends without guilt.
speaking of guilt, how was the public sex?
Oh, shut up.
Justin, please. It's not funny.
we're literally laughingstocks.
well, it's very kennedy, isn't it, to be part of some luridly glamorous sex scandal?
there is nothing amusing about anything that's gone on here tonight.
Nora, I am so sorry. I am beyond mortified. This is...
Julia, could you please stop apologizing?
could we all just stop pretending that we're perfect people?
just for 14 seconds? - That would be great.
just remember, it's unbelievable countryside, fine dining...
Sarah, you have no reason to be angry at your husband.
I forced it out of him, and I'm sure your sister kitty has told you I know everything.
you don't know anything.
if the company's in trouble, if the two of you have done something that you should tell me...
we've done something?
I shouldn't be kept in the dark.
it wasn't just your father that built ojai. It was me, too.
raising you kids all by myself, that afforded him the luxury to build a company in the first place.
company? If we have a roof over our head in three months, we'll be doing very well.
no, no, no. If it were that bad, your father would have told me.
because he shared so much?
the company's dying, mom.
now if you want to blame me, blame me.
or perhaps in your all-knowing wisdom and motherness, you could save it somehow so that we could keep coming to this wretched event year after year.
26? Going once...
going twice...
sold to the lovely and generous mrs. Nora walker for $25, 800!
no. - yeah.
mom, you bid. Yeah, you did.
I didn't. I didn't bid.
you bid. You did. - you did.
I didn't.
well, listen, I always wanted to see new zealand.
no one knows us there. Maybe we can move there.
no?
Joe, could I have a few moments with my daughter, please?
you walked into it, didn't you?
when you joined the company, and you didn't know what you walked into, right?
dad sold a million dollars worth of stock back to the company, but he inflated the value.
Ojai paid $15 million for it...
$15 million we can't find.
$15 million?
he used the pension fund to cover the shortfall.
saul tried and tried to hold it together, and so did I, and so did tommy.
but we're sinking fast.
Oh, god.
Oh, mom, I never knew anything could be this hard.
we--we can't catch a break. There's never any good news.
I work and work, and I miss my children, and I don't recognize myself anymore.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
you never ask me for anything. You act so self-sufficient all the time.
I got that from you, mom.
I watched you power through life.
you had kitty to fight with, kevin to admire, justin to baby, tommy to lean on.
what were you thinking about me all that time?
what was I thinking?
I was thinking...
I was...
I am... in awe of you, sarah.
you became the woman I always wanted to be.
and you did it all without losing your softness or your goodness.
I love all my children...
but I have so much respect for you, sarah.
all that, and you gave me two of the most perfect grandchildren on earth.
you're not a daughter, sarah. You're the damn trifecta.
you rock, mom.
you just do.
you should go and find your sister.
she needs you now. Your family needs you.
what are you talking about? I can't leave you alone like that.
I'll grab a taxi.
imagine that we're in new york. You'd think nothing of it.
go on.
I'll be upset if you don't.
it's been a wonderful night.
it has.
compliments of the management.
fabulous.
Hey, all. What's the skinny?
Scotty, how nice.
would you care to dance?
no, honey. I don't want to go inside.
who said anything about going back inside?
and I can't seem to get an answer as to when or if she's coming back.
I wanted to talk to you about joe and the kiss.
Oh, please. We are so past that.
I may have led him on a little bit.
did you, uh, tell jason about you and scotty's little "slumber party"?
no, actually.
you are beyond pathetic.
you spend so much time trying to get somebody to love you that you can't help anybody.
that's enough.
I can't do this to my family.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
can you just go?
I don't wanto wait to get married.
I want to get married now.
from this moment, a moment like this, because you loved me.
now how is that a good wedding song?
it's past tense.
and perfect for my marriage.
shouldn't your fiance be doing this?
well, I guess the second time around, it sort of loses its allure.
Yeah, it's like going through the steps again.
speaking of which, I need to apologize to rebecca.
Yeah, she probably hates you.
Oh, no, no, no. No one expects you to be warm and fuzzy at your own intervention.
who wants a cookie?
mom, how's it going looking for a dress?
it's so depressing.
every single mother of the bride dress is beige or bedazzled, with all these necks and sleeves and jackets and things.
you get to be a certain age, and they--they try to desex you.
I mean, I might as well be dressed in beige paper and headed off towards the recycling bin.
how about ol' blue eyes? - That's a good idea.
no, no, we can't, we can't because robert's first wedding was practically sinatra-themed.
what about that beautiful song by the dixie chicks?
at a republican candidate's wedding?
well, if you rule out every democrat, you're basically left with ted nugent, lynyrd skynyrd and zz top.
well, I'm a democrat, and I lost my virginity to "she's got legs."
Oh, god! - Crossing a le, sarah.
mine was the "dirty dancing" theme.
No! Be gayer.
I bet kitty's was talk radio.
Hey. Justin?
don't look at me. I'm not having this conversation in front of mom.
come on. - Oh, please.
uh, uh, pink floyd's "the wall," gabby kleiner, the tenth grade.
are you... you--you heard that?
Thanks. I have two first-sex soundtracks, girl and guy.
okay, now stop. Stop, you guys, please.
you're ruining all music for me.
sorry I'm late. What's up, buddy?
Robert, what song did you lose your virginity to?
mom.
well, we're just trying to figure out our wedding song.
interesting methodology.
Um,"endless love."
Yeah, okay. Um, bad news.
I spoke to jason, and he can't come to the wedding.
you spoke with jason?
Yeah, uh, briefly. And then the other day, we got completely cut off.
the other day?
I haven't spoken to him in weeks, and he's called you twice?
he was gonna be my best man.
Oh, well--well, the next time you two chat, maybe you could tell him his committed, monogamous, yet highly sought after boyfriend says hi.
so does everybody know that kitty has us scheduled for dance lessons?
ballroom dancing? Kitty, pleasE.
come on, tommy. I'm not that bad.
I've got it. I've got it-- "pretty woman."
no, thanks, mom, but that will make me come off a little conceited.
no, no, no. I mean, that was my first time song.
I can't believe I remember that.
mom, we don't need to picture you and dad.
who said anything about dad?
What?! - mom!
wait a minute. Wait a minute. I thought dad was your first. - No.
I thought dad swept you off your feet when you were barely 18. - No.
mom, you sluT.
it was the '60s.
it was this-- this guy I'd known in high school--stan harris.
he got drafted and--and went off to canada.
it was in the backseat of his dad's cutlass... - oh, my god.
and he was tall, and I was short... - I gotta go.
I'm gonna make more popcorn. - thank you. I'm...
fine. Fine. So what, I-I guess I've just never had sex before?
that doesn't look safe.
it lowers your blood pressure. - Yep?
so does a glass of wine with far less risk of paralysis.
why aren't you working?
I'm on days.
we could go back to writing notes if actual conversation is too weird.
Oh, sorry. No messages.
of course not.
do you wanna be my date for kitty's wedding?
Oh, how appealing. A spite invite?
no.
Yes. A-a little.
you know going to a wedding alone is torture.
what about jason?
Reverend "god forbid I call you back" won't be there.
Yeah, but his brother robert will.
what will he think?
who cares?
Miatello's is catering.
they're serving those little gorgonzola and potato pizzas with saffron and sage.
you had me at gorgonzola.
thought so.
Kitty. Hi.
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.
I-I hope I didn't wake you up.
no, no, I've been up for a while.
um, well, do you wanna come in?
sure.
Yeah, c-come in.
um, is justin okay?
Yeah, actually, you know, he's--he's doing much better. - Oh, good.
and you know what? Thank you, by the way, for letting everybody know what was going on.
and I-I know he--he said some really awful things to you.
no, he said awful things to everyone, so...
actually, he did.
but, you know, it's just...
if it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have been able to help him and...
so anyway, the reason that I'm here is that -
and there's no pressure, and you can definitely say no if you feel uncomfortable -
but I just wondered if maybe by any chance you would want to be one of my bridesmaids?
Oh, my god.
well, I-I dn't even know if I'd be invited to the wedding.
are you crazy? Well, of course.
of course you're invited to the wedding.
you're my--you're my sister.
well, is sa--is sarah okay with it?
I mean... - yeah. You know, who--who cares?
she'll--she'll be fine.
yes? No? Maybe?
you can think about it if you want. -Yeah, I--I'd love to.
Really? -Yeah.
that's great.
should we hug?
sure.
okay. - Okay.
Graham has quite a reputation for growing midsized companies.
well, graham, reputation aside, ojai's not looking to re any outside consultants at this time.
right. Well, that's usually the first response.
saul tells me that you wanna branch out into the organic market?
Yes, that's something that we've been considering.
let me give you some free advice--don'T.
every other vendor's already noticed that trend, so, uh, you're a little behind the curve there.
and frankly, sarah, overhauling our farming practices would cost a hell of a lot more than hiring a private consultant.
Graham has some ideas about the international market.
well, that's right.
uh, namely, china.
it's a booming economy, it's an expanding middle class -
I've read all the same journals that you... have.
well, actually, I just came back from there.
have you been?
no, I haven'T.
well, you gotta go.
the upscale markets in shanghai just can't handle the demand.
just the word "california" transforms the everyday grape into, uh, a,uh, luxury item.
well, just the word "china," for me, conjures up a logistical nightmare.
and ojai doesn't have the human resources to overcome international licensing, tariffs -
Yeah, well, that's just what I do.
I mean, I can help you navigate that whole thing.
exactly, and thewe create a special division of ojai to handle foreign sales.
leave your proposal.
I'll call you if I have any questions.
okay, well, thanks for your time, sarah.
great to meet you.
thanks for the free advice.
I'll be in touch.
okay, great, I will fax you a price list.
Bye.
Hey.
how you doing?
I have been fielding phone calls all morning.
now correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we hire lena to do that?
Oh, she's probably running late.
is she, or are you guys doing that thing you do where she comes five minutes after you so that I don't know that the two of you -
no, no, no, I,uh, I ended things with her.
should we be looking for a new office manager?
sorry.
I stopped for pastries.
Tommy, I got your favorite.
bear claws.
Walker landing.
Yeah, he's right here.
it's your wife.
Julia, hey.
what's up?
Elizabeth wanted to talk to her daddy.
Yeah. Put her on.
Hey, honey.
Hi.
Oh, my god.
I was gonna call yesterday, but I thought a surprise would be...surprising.
wow, it's so good to see you.
Yeah, you, too.
and her.
Oh, my god. She's so big! Hi!
welcome home, julia.
she's incredible. - Thanks.
the place looks so good. - Thanks.
uh, this is lena, our office manager.
Oh, of course. Hi.
it's nice to put a face to the voice.
Yeah.
all right, well, I'm gonna leave for the day and get them settled.
take as much time as you need.
Thanks, holly. - sure.
all right, let's go.
okay.
by it was nice to meet you, lena.
you, too.
I'll, um, I'll--I'll check in later.
you still wa the job?
you might want to rethink the work wardrobe.
saul, do you remember stan harris?
of course I remember him.
mother was convinced that he was gonna ruin you.
that's because I told her we were gonna travel around the country in his volkswagen bus and join a commune.
I googled him. - You what?
get this--he's history teacher at canyon falls high.
he's single.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.
since when does google tell you what someone's marital status is?
I... e-mailed him.
I couldn't help myself.
I might've been this whole other person if he hadn't gone to canada.
he lives 15 minutes away. Can you believe it?
you know what? He asked me out to dinner.
that's impressive.
I shouldn't go, not in a million years.
we'll have nothing to talk about.
what if he looks old? What if he thinks i look old?
Oh, nora, come on. You don't look that old.
well, then again, what have I got to lose?
I mean, there's history there.
what if that same old spark still exists?
it could still exist. You know that.
I know that?
what are you doing, nora? - What?
I told you that I didn't want to talk about this, that I needed time to talk about this.
you want me to get in touch with the guy that I told you about? Is that it?
is that why you're mentioning stan harris, nora?
no, I brought up stan because I wanted to talk to you about stan.
Yeah, right.
look, don't get me wrong.
I do think we have to talk about this.
I mean, you can't tell me that you were in love with a man once and then we never discuss it again.
we have to talk about it eventually.
you know what, nora? I gotta go.
well, saul, ould I--should I go...
Oh, well, you know, they're-- they're just showing off, right?
I can tell you, we're not gonna be doing anything like that.
wow, that--that was-- that was really, really good.
that was amazing, and--and thank you, but I don't think that we're gonna be needing anything...
don't worry about it, senator.
we'll adjust the steps to your song.
well, you know what? We don't even really have a-a song yet.
we--we just wanna learn a couple of steps so we don't look like complete morons at our--our wedding.
exactly.
okay.
whatever you wish.
Martena, just play a slow fox-trot, please.
just watch it once.
it's slow, slow, quick, quick.
let's try it all in one line, starting with the left foot.
and... slow.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
um, so it's--so it's-- so it's left, right and then...
and then which--which side? - no, no, for you, kitty, it's the opposite.
see, you go right, left, side, together.
Hello?
So--oh, it's opp--oh, I didn't--nobody told me that.
no problem. That's what we're here for.
okay, okay, um, let's see.
so it's right...left.
and then to the side.
good. That's good, but to the other side. - The other side.
that was the majority leader.
Yeah, well, you're in the minority party, so you can call him back.
all right, let's try it facing each other.
okay.
kitty...His face is much more attractive thanour feet. Huh?
head up, please.
slow, slow, quick, quick.
senator, you're a natural.
thank you.
Kitty, please stopeading.
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
you know, it's just--it's--it's in my nature, but I'm trying.
okay, and this is gonna take a long time, isn't it?
you know what? He just gave us the steps, like, three seconds ago.
they're two votes down on S. R. 7550.
don't you think I should spend some time on that?
you know what? You never told me you could dance.
you know, inaugurals, state dinners...
and first weddings. Right. I get it.
I think I have the steps in order.
you should stay, rehearse.
reschedule.
I'll make the time. Promise.
thank you. I appreciate it, but I've gotta go.
okay, kitty. Let's dance.
five, six, seven, eight.
slow.
good, good.
Hey. Sorry about the mess.
if I would've known you were coming, I would've cleaned up.
that's okay.
Yeah, I guess I, uh, I reverted.
you're allowed.
I'm sorry I was... gone so long.
you had a lot to sort out.
I just--I wish I could take back so many things that I said.
I know.
me, too.
can we go back...
to the way things were?
I want to, so bad.
you have no idea.
I come with decadence.
what happened? Did you rob the long beach aquarium?
we had a chichi 6-year-oldirthday party at the restaant
"little mermaid" theme.
turns out the kids couldn't bear to eat sebastian.
the mermaid's best friend?
anyhow, their drama, our dinner. - Great.
uh, would sebastian like a little melted butter on the side?
I don't know, but I would. Marvelous.
light some candles. I'll be right back.
Oh, candles?
I mean, it's just takeout, when you think of it.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure, no candles.
uh. well, we can still have champagne, right?
sure.
Hey, sarah. - Hey.
is--is kitty here?
Oh, she'll be down in a minute.
so are--are you the maid of honor?
well, I'm certainly not the matron of honor.
I'm--I'm sorry.
okay. Well?
well, what do you think?
gorgeous. - Really?
Yeah, it's--it's got this great '60s vibe to it. I mean...
that's because it's from the '60s.
well, is it too '60s?
no. No, I think it's classic.
no, no, what I meant by that is it's very jackie O.
I don't know if that's the look I'm going for on my wedding day.
I mean, that's not even the right political party.
Oh, I'm just gonna stop talking.
Oh, you look gorgeous. - Really?
just gorgeous, really.
speaking of gorgeous...mom, where are you going?
well, yeah?
Oh, just, um, dinner with a friend.
honey, this is so exciting.
we'll take you tomorrow to the alterations person... - okay.
and just, you know, a few tiny little things, okay? - Okay.
it's exciting.
I have to go. It's so exciting.
have fun.
let's seE.
well, you know, I-I think there actually really is something amazing about the the history...Of this dress. - yeah
and--and it's free.
can't beat that.
is that mom's dress?
Yeah, it's-- it's great... right?
Yeah. Looks good.
can I, uh, can i steal rebecca for a second?
look, justin, I know what you're doing, and I just want you know that-- that it's fine.
I'm fine.
look, it's not fin okay?
I-I feel horrible about what I said.
it was hurtful and it was mean.
and some of it was true.
I was angry, okay?
and I took a cheap shot at you.
you are not pathetic.
I'm pathetic, okay?
if it weren't for you, I-I wouldn't be getting clear.
I'm just happy you're getting the help that you need, you know?
I want you to know how important you are to me and how deeply, deeply sorry I am.
wow, you're really good at this whole making amends thing, aren't you?
I've had some practice.
I--oh, excuse me.
Hello?
uh, yeah. How are you?
sure. Yeah. That, uh, that sounds great.
I'll see you there.
all right, bye.
that was your friend lena.
what did--what'd she want?
I don't know. She just asked me out for coffee.
Hi, I'm--I'm looking for someone.
right in here.
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. - No, no, no.
no? - Ah, ten minutes.
Oh, traffic in this city is absolutely impossible.
you can't get anywhere, ever.
if you're invited to go someplace between the hours of 5: 00 and 7: 00,
I have to tell them, no, I'm sorry.
you can't get there from here. You just can't.
I'm here.
you look beautiful.
Yeah, well, don't look to close.
my neck looks like someone's bedroom curtains.
Hey, listen, I-I gained 20 pounds and I've got a artificial hip.
Really? - No. Kidding.
I'm sorry, nora.
I--I'm a little bit nervous.
I'm nervous, too.
I can't believe you e-mailed me.
did I do that?
you did.
I... where do we even start?
um... how about a pitcher of margaritas?
Yes.
we're at this immigration rally. - Right.
Ah, you know, all my kids.
I mean, my class.
there's this one--alonzo.
he's really smart, but he's, uh, you know, a little unfocused.
and I'm watching him.
and I'm seeing that he--he's a little bit affected by this, maybe a lot.
and I'm thinking,this is why I do this.
he's starting to think.
he--he wants to demand his right to be heard, you know?
and just at that moment... - yeah?
he gets on the stage... - yeah?
drops his pants and moons the governor. - oh, no!
Yeah. - oh, no!
I didn't want him to feel humiliated, so I get up and I join him.
Oh, god!
that's horrible!
what happened?
well, you know, I spent a night in detention, paid a fine.
Alonzo, I think, is running for president of the school now.
well, good for him.
I-I spent a night in jail.
well, I got caught smoking a joint with my girlfriend in her car-- Emily Craft.
Hey, you never-- you never liked grass.
Oh, when did you pick up that habit?
never.
are you kidding?
since last you saw me, all i've been doing is raising kids and being married to a republican, so...
Yeah, I knew that.
so you never got married?
no, I-I-I, you know, I came close a couple of times, but I don't think I ever really found the right person.
Yeah, the right person.
what are you doing tomorrow night?
I'm sorry. I know you've got plans, it's too soon. I'm--I'm just...
no, no. My goodness, at this age, almost nothing is too soon.
Yes, let's... let's do it.
let's go out.
good,'cause I couldn't stand to wait another 40 years kevin. Go to bed.
actually, could you take your foot out?
it's digging right into... - sorry.
I should go to my air mattress.
Yeah, you should.
I really like th on you.
come on, I look like a giant tangerine.
uh, I gotta take that. I'm working.
I'm gonna get a couple more drses.
Hey, it's graham finch.
listen, I--I've been thinking about our meeting.
I hope I didn't come on too strong.
bulldozer isn't your normal speed?
well, that's me. You know, I'm aggressive.
I see something I want, I go for it. That's why you want me.
Oh, now I want you? - Figure of speech.
so what are you doing tonight? You wanna have some dinner?
uh, I have plans.
well, then how about tomorrow night?
listen, just give me an hour, and if I can't convince you, uh, you'll never see me again.
what do you say?
okay, tomorrow night it is. - Great. See you then.
Oh, don't you like that? - It's a pretty color, I guess.
what do you think of this one?
Oh, wow, I--that color is so much better.
Really? - Oh, totally.
now how come you're not bringing anybody to the wedding?
Oh, you know, it's been a bit of a dry spell lately.
dry spell? That doesn't sound like you.
what does that mean?
just that when I think of you, I don't think of dry spell.
you know, I do know a couple of really cute guys in my office.
do you have type?
no, I don't really have a type.
except for married men, right, sarah?
that's what you were gonna say?
no. No, she wasn't. - I would never say that.
hmm, well, there goes that foot in my mouth again.
it's not that I don't think about it occasionally.
it's just that I've long stopped obsessing about you, joe and my divorce.
what I am obsessed about is kitty, her wedding and which dress she's gonna force me to wear.
right, kit?
this is it.
this is the one.
Oh!
Oh, my god.
can you believe it?
it's perfect. - it's perfect.
what about mom's dress?
Oh, well, no. No, I mean, it would be the one if I didn't already have the one.
Oh, you're right. - But oh, my god.
just try it on. - No, no, I can't. I can't.
it would be cheating. I shouldn't even be looking at it.
Oh, come on. Looking's not cheating...
is it, rebecca?
Oh, my god.
Hey. - Hey.
you going to the gym?
Yeah, have to. Working in the kitchen demands it, or you end up, you know, with...
I know, with love handles like me.
I think we've already established I have no problems with your body.
nor I yours.
I know what happened. You were vulnerable.
your boyfriend's a million miles away, and I was a warm body after lobster dinner.
add champagne and voila...
mistake sex. - What if it wasn't a mistake?
Kevin, you don't have to make me feel better by turning yesterday's nostalgic sex romp into something that it wasn't.
I'm not.
believe me, I'm not.
Yes, of course I miss him. You know, why wouldn't I?
he's not calling me. But it's like what we had, he's put into this compartment, and now he's gone back to his first love, which is god or the church or--or something. I don't know.
but it's certainly not me. - You don't know that. When people are far away
look, I know how I feel, so just let me feel that way.
it hurts.
Hey.
it'll be all right. I promise.
I'm not so sure.
what is this?
we go on a lovely picnic at the beach, and then you bring me out here for what, a gang initiation?
take a closer look.
all right.
Oh, it's jones hall.
we saw dylan here.
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Yeah, the memory of that night...
has gotten me through a lot of cold winters in toronto.
it was my first time, you know.
it was our first time.
I lied. I didn't want you to think I didn't know what I was doing.
Oh, stan, I was so madly in love with you.
why did you leave?
you ran off to canada.
you left everything-- your family, your friends, me.
I-I wasn't enough for you.
what are you talking about?
you love the fight you can't win.
but you already had me.
I mean, even then I knew I wasn't a challenge.
I wasn't looking for a challenge.
weren't you? - No.
you married a rich republican, somebody you can always argue with.
we're different.
I mean, I-I don't like the fight.
I'm committed to the cause.
Stan...will you come see my life, meet my kids?
will you come with me to my daughter's wedding?
I'd be honored.
will your mother be there?
um, yeah.
Oh, boy.
Oh, god, I love this song, still.
so do I.
why are you calling me at home?
Hey, I just checked the office voice mail, and your brunch meeting canceled.
Yeah, and listen, by the way, I'm not gonna be bothering you with personal calls.
I'm not that dense.
so just relax.
I'm--I'm--I'm sorry. Thanks.
have a good weekend.
who's calling so early?
uh, that was the office. They canceled my meeting.
so, um, I could make breakfast.
I wouldn't have pegged you for a half-caff.
I would've assumed an extra shot.
Yeah, well, I'm-- I'm working on moderation.
Really?
that doesn't sound like the guy I met at the bar.
uh, I guess rebecca didn't tell you.
no.
I'm--I'm in recovery.
I was taking pain medication for my leg, and pretty soon after, I just started taking it just to take it.
and now I've been in detox for a few weeks, and going to meetings, talking to my sponsor.
and if you want to run, I completely understand.
no, listen, I don't get scared off that easy.
I'm a pathetic loser who dates a married guy, and then gets surprised and bummed when I t dumped.
wow, that sucks.
Yeah, well... it was kind of doomed from the start, you know?
I want you to know that I'm a terrible choice for a rebound guy.
I mean, not--not assuming, you know, that this is anything past coffee or...
no, go ahead, assume.
I just thought, you know, I shouldn't get involved while I'm getting sober.
I still have nightmares about combat.
my leg still looks pretty gnarly from my injury.
I don't have a job and I live with my mom.
you can stop. You're an awful choice. - Yeah
so how aboutust being, you know, my rebound caffeine buddy?
well, as long as you don't mind the half-caff.
no... not at all.
and slow, slow...
quick, quick.
you know, it's tough to replace a quarter of the staff - but stolarski comes highly recommended. - He worked for phipps.
Yeah, we can't have that.
okay, well, there's donnelly, but I hear he's a bit of a screamer.
what--why are you stepping on my feet? - You know what?
Travis' voice keeps boring into the part of my brain that is trying to keep count.
I wasn't aware you had that part.
Oh, would you shut up, travis?
Kitty, have you been practicing like I told you? - Yes.
What--what is the part that comes after back left?
side right. - Side right.
well, you know what?
maybe you guys should just have the first dance together.
what about benitez? - Yeah.
you know what? You know what?
let's just forget the whole thing.
I mean, clearly, you're busy, I'm busy, and - and you're just not interested.
and--and why should you be?
Kitty, come on, it's just a dance.
no, it is not just a dance.
it is a dance that you've had before for a ceremony that you've had before.
and I'm going to be wearing a used dress.
and you know what? I just thought it would be nice for us to have a dance that was ours.
but you know what? You're right.
it's just too much to ask to have a first at my own wedding.
shut up, travis!
so should we clean this up, or should we just, like, sort of let it sit and blend in with the rest of your place?
whoa, hey.
so now you're making fun of my apartment?
no. Are you kidding me?
I'm having mess envy, for god sakes.
I mean, rebellion in my house is, like, leaving a crumb on the table.
no wonder you turned to drugs.
so what are your other vices, besides being kind of a slob?
uh...Well, coffee.
definitely.
wine, clothes shopping. - I see that.
yes - Hang on. - Sure.
Hey. - Look, justin's in recovery.
I know. Listen, can I call you back?
uh, why? Is justin there?
Oh, my god. - Yeah.
um, why don't I just talk to you tomorrow? - Okay.
what was all that about, if you don't mind my asking?
I thought you were talking about justin.
no, she asked him out, mom.
she did?
Yeah, and--and--and it's really not that I care.
it's just, he's not supposed to be dating anyone right now.
Ugh, wait till kitty and sarah find out.
it--it's not like they don't judge me enough already.
I really don't need them blaming me for this.
sweetie, this is hardly your fault.
tell that to them.
I mean, kitty is so intimidating.
Sarah is-- I'm constantly paranoid that she's making these digs at me.
I keep humiliating myself.
Rebecca, stop second-guessing yourself.
it's not that easy, mom.
I know that it's not that easy.
but this shrinking violet that you're becoming...
that's not my daughter.
I mean, you--you never used to care what people thought about you.
you didn't worry about what you said or what you didn't say.
I admire that about you, even when you do that with me.
do that with them.
so wait, no, you're telling me you haven't seen, uh,"blades of glory"?
Nah, not yet. - Oh, my word.
you have to see this. I have the dvd.
we can watch it tonight.
you know what? I-I sh--I should probably get outta here.
okay.
I hope I didn't scare you off or anything.
no. Are you--I'm having a great, great time.
I just--I'm worried if I stay too long that my--my sponsor will get pissed off.
and he's kind of a big dude, lot of tatts, so...
no, listen, I totally get that you should put your recovery first.
okay, thanks.
you know, we'll wait for the right time.
all right, cool. - Cool.
cool.
screw it.
Com...mm, try the lemon scallops. Amazing.
mm, I prefer the orange chicken.
Oh, man, this-- this duck sauce is amazing.
can--I can really taste the peaches and the plums.
you know, it's so... - oh, I get it.
everything that we've been eating features produce that we grow at ojai. Very good.
Oh, and here I was, I thought I was being very subtle.
I'm just very smart.
well, then you'll hear what I'm saying.
a billion people eat this food every day.
don't you think it would taste a lot better coming from your orchards?
of course.
but you're not gonna charm me into a deal.
not that you're not charming. It's just, there's something about you.
I don't know if it's the italian suit or the fast-talk of easy money and international markets.
maybe it's the perfect pedigree. - Prect pedigree?
it's just all too smooth to be true.
I'm suspicious.
first of all, I wasn't born into this suit, okay?
and when I walked into ojai, I was not convinced that I would close the deal.
I just thought that if you heard what I had to say, you'd see it was a sound decision, something that's good for ojai and for your family, that's it.
look... honestly, it's enticing.
but Ojai can't afford that kind of risk exposure, and I can't jeopardize a company that my father built, no matter the growth potential.
so what if I told you I have a guy that could get ojai in the market access program?
government subsidies?
I'd tailor your company's profile so it's exactly what they're looking for.
the U. S.D. A. Wants to increase its agricultural exports.
why not let 'em help pay for it?
who knows? We structure this deal right, there might even be enough left over for me to take you on a private tour of Beijing.
okay.
get me more information on the program.
I'll need to see the forecasts.
if the numbers excite me, we'll talk.
Hello?
Hello--jason?!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, I've missed you.
no, no, I'm sorry. No, it's just your voice.
you--well, why haven't you call me?
no, god. No, of course I know the service is spotty.
no, I'm good. I'm good.
I just... I--yeah, well, I need-- I need-- I need to talk to you, too.
cleaning or packing? - Packing.
a friend offered me her couch. I think it'll be easier this way.
Yeah, you're right.
it would be easier.
but difficult is sometimes good, you know?
it forces you to do things you didn't think you could.
Oh... we can do it, kevin.
we always seem to end up...
doing it.
what we never seem to understand is that it gets us nowhere.
I finally spoke with jason.
good. I'm glad. I... I broke up with him.
Kevin, why do you always have to be such a drama queen?
so he didn't call you for a couple of weeks.
it's not that.
Scotty, when I first met you, I thought we... - Kevin, Kevin...
if you're about to romanticize what we had, just...
I'm not. That's the whole point.
because what we had was-- it--it was messy.
you know, we were hot and cold and back and forth, all over the place.
but I wanna be back there with you because I wanna be honest about who I am.
did you tell jason we slept together? - Yes, I did.
look, I know I'm--I'm asking way too much of you.
but like I said, easy isn't all it's cracked up to be.
it's gone.
Yep. Yep. It's gone. It's gone.
the... "the one" is gone.
well, at least mom won't be heartbroken.
well, that's true. - You know, I think it's a shame.
I think u should wear whatever you want on your wedding day.
Oh, okay, rebecca. Well, thank you very much.
but you know what? It'll be fine.
Hey, it's just my opinion.
Yeah, well, my opinion is we need to commit.
these dresses are fine.
what about julia? Does she look good in blue?
Julia looks good in anything. - Bitch.
all right, rebecca, let's start with you.
so--so what do you think?
honestly, I-I don't know what sisters say in these situations.
but the only way that I am ever gonna be able to be myself around you two is if I stop filtering everything.
so to answer your question, kitty-- no.
no, I-I-I don't like this color on me and I-I don't like it on sarah.
if you really wanna know the dress that I would pick, it would...
Oh, my god.
well, R-Rebecca, don't stop now.
no, you're on a roll.
Kitty, the one!
it's on sale. - Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my god, Rebecca.
Rebecca, do you really think I should wear what I want?
I do.
do you wanna wear this dress?
I do.
I swear I didn't go out looking for it.
it--it was just there.
and--and then it went on sale and I just--it was-- it was on sale?
I was--I was just feeling like my whole wedding was being recycled.
and I-I just needed my something new.
And--but please, mom, please don't be angry.
honey, I'm not angry. It's fine. You don't have to wear my.
a good fine or is it passive-aggressive fine? - Sweetheart, I offered my dress to you as an option.
I know, but when you found me in it the other day, you practically started weeping. - Oh, I did not.
you were very emotional. - Well, honey, you're getting married.
you were like,"ahh!" - And I came in, and you had my dress on.
it brought back memories. - Well, but still, yeah.
I know, but still. - Listen to me.
this is your wedding, your memories to create.
make your own choices, your own history.
you don't have to relive mine.
I can't believe that you're being this cool.
I mean, it's not that I thought that you would be uncool, but I just--I...
well, thanks.
it's beautiful.
thank you, mom. Thank you.
it's beautiful, honey. It's beautiful.
Thanks, mom.
Kitty? - Yeah?
you know what I did? - No. What did you do?
I went out to dinner with stan harris.
uh, my "pretty woman" stan harris.
Oh, my god. How was it?
Yeah. It was fine. G-good.
if it's all right with you, I,uh...
I invited him to your wedding. Is that all right?
uh, yeah. Of course. Are you kidding?
it's great. Uh, sorry.
uh, honey, honey, just hold on one second.
mom, wait, mom.
Yeah. - We're gonna have to find you a very hot dress.
I think I have an idea.
you're going to dye this?
something bold.
midnight blue, maybe.
but this dress is a classic.
I know. I love it.
it's my history, and I'm going to keep it.
maybe it's time to hike up the hemline a little.
okay. - Okay.
here we go.
Oh, hey.
I didn't think you'd still be here by now.
I figured you would've gone home to your family.
Yeah, I was just catching up on some paperwork.
uh, so you're-- you're going out?
Yeah.
got a date.
uh... you're seeing somebody happened a few days ago.
and don't worry, I wasn't cheating.
no, I wasn't... - Tommy, I was joking.
right.
have a good night, tommy.
this is way too g for a fund-raiser.
I mean, there aren't even that many republicans in L. A.
it's beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, wait. No, no, no. No, wait.
we have to--they're-- they're rehearsing.
Oh, come on, let's listen. - No, no, no, no.
we're late. We gotta go. - Come on.
this is - excuse me, guys?
do you take requests?
Hello, senator.
that Lyle lovett?
what are you doing?
no, what did--what-- what did you do?
Why--why do I feel like you're getting ready to propose to me?
we already did that.
I... I already did that.
I know that I haven't been able to focus on the wedding.
and I know that you think it's because I've done this before.
and yeah, we haven't been able to pick out our song.
but, you know, kitty, any song that's even remotely romantic reminds me of us.
you make everything new.
would you like to dance?
you're insane.
no, absolutely insane.
I cannot believe you.
because Saturday is gone - just for the record - this is a first for me, too. - I still feel the feeling of...
what? Hello. There's...
don't you worry. It's only me.
there is no such thing as only you, Kimberly.
boy, this is bizarre. It's not my birthday.
Mnh-mnh. You're not holding a cake.
you lock the door? - No.
Oh, gosh. Oh. Oh. I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry! Justin, is the bar set up for the lunch rush?
uh, you know, not yet.
I was looking for olives, but we're out, uh, so I was just trying to get some.
well, you know, time's wastin', so chop chop.
Yep. Be right there. All right.
that ignorant, small-minded, friggin' Neanderthal!
well, technically, it's pronounced "neander-tall."
huh. Yeah.
and it was filled with l... I mean filled with lies...
and so right now in the hallway, I-I-I ran into him.
you can't believe the vile things he said to me.
well, you can't take it personally.
he's like that with everybody.
how can I not take it personally?
he called my show "Ask Madam Mao."
Ooh! Would you care for some coffee?
no. No, thank you. Um, look, sit down.
take a breath.
now do you know who the two biggest advertisers are on his show?
haven't a clue. - Laser beam home security systems and herbal-firm male potency pills.
now as a trained psychotherapist, that tells me two things about him and his audience...
paranoid personality type with accompanying morbid insecurity disorder.
talking to you always makes me feel better.
Oh. That's what friends are for, right?
right.
okay.
you know, I was just reading here in the paper, there's a-a documentary about Leonard Bernstein on public television tonight.
Oh, my God. I have been in love with him since I was 20.
well, would you like to come over and watch it with me?
at your house? - Yeah.
I-I just got this, uh, this big screen television.
I mean, we'll be able to see the entire orchestra.
well, how could I say no? What time?
well, it starts at 10: 00, so, uh, 9:45?
perfect. Perfect.
he invited you at 9: 45 for a 10: 00 TV show?
well, he's a shrink. Maybe he's only comfortable in 45-minute increments.
I know you wanna take this to the next level.
I don't think that even counts as a level.
that's like the elevator stalled between floors. We did agree to be friends early on. Mom, you love your job. You enjoy Karl's company.
if you get into a romantic relationship, and one of you gets hurt, then you've lost a friend and screwed up your work situation.
what if he is actually the man of my dreams, and... and I miss my chance? You know what?
I'm in over my head. Why don't you ask Sarah?
well, I can't ask Sarah. If this deal goes through, then she'll be my boss. She'll be his boss.
mom, I gotta go. I'm sorry. I'm hosting lunch, and I've accidentally overbooked the reservations. Where's Saul?
wine convention, Napa.
and since this is Justin's first double shift behind the bar, and I clearly have no idea what I'm doing,
Scotty's a little freaked out. Honey, well, just pretend you have people skills.
uh, I-I gotta go. Talk to you later. - Bye, mom.
um, Angie, have you met my brother Kevin? Uh, nice to meet you.
nice to meet you. My God, your hands are cold. You okay?
we were in the walk-in cooler for a while.
getting beer. Yeah. It can take a while.
you don't want to startle the beer by moving it too fast.
I should get back to the kitchen. - I'll come with you.
talk to you later. - Bye, sweetie.
talk to you later.
so I was scrolling down the calls from last week, and I came across "Gabriela Laurent."
why didn't you tell me that your mother called?
it slipped my mind.
o-okay. Uh, uh, what did she say?
she wants to come for a visit. What did you tell her?
the truth. It's not a good time for me. You told her not to come?
I gotta finish my sketches for the Shanghai mural by next week.
okay? I-I thought you were almost done with those.
they're really great, by the way.
look, she's not a part of my life.
I've set it up that way. That's the way I like it. No, I-I know.
it's just, Luc, what if I want to meet her?
can we talk about this later?
I wish you would tell me why you feel so strongly.
I'm completely...
Sarah, there's nothing more to talk about. Answer the phone.
Hey, mom. Just, uh, wait a sec.
Sarah, did you listen to my show this morning?
because I think I really hit it out of the park.
did you hear the call from the guy from Oxnard who doesn't get on with his mother? No, I didn't.
five minutes in, and he's bawling like a baby. Bawling.
what did you say? Sarah, honey, take an interest in it. Mom, I'm interested.
I'm asking you, what did you say to the guy to make him cry?
well, I can't describe it to you. You had to be there.
I gotta come in later to meet the station manager... Norbert.
I'll listen to it then, okay? Um...
you know what, honey? Would you mind asking him?
Why? Is somebody screwing somebody? No, no. Nothing like that.
just a-a girl in accounting was wondering.
why don't you ask him yourself?
well, I-I, um...
Oh, mom, I gotta go. I got a notary here.
Sarah. Sarah, never mind.
don't ask about the policy thing. So just forget about it. Okay.
Ah. Hello. Come in.
Sarah? - Yeah.
it's me... Gabriela.
you must call me maman.
that... you... Wow. Oh.
Oh, my... oh!
Shh. Sarah, as a mother, I'm sure you understand that sometimes you miss your children so much...
you just cannot stay away from them. - Oh, totally.
and when I heard from his cousin Albert he was getting married, my only desire was come here and meet Sarah.
Oh! Oh, that... that's so sweet.
well, I've been dying to meet you, too. - Oh. Merci.
Luc told me how busy he is, so I went ahead and booked a hotel room.
Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. You know what?
Yes, we have to do that. - My kids are staying with their dad this week, so you can take my daughter's room. Sarah, no.
no, no, no, no. Sarah, I would rather die before I distract my genius son from his work.
well, let me at least take you. It's the least I can do.
I've just got a couple of small business errands I've gotta run.
actually, you should come with me.
you could meet my mother.
what? You're so lovely.
thank you. Ah.
Oh, I'm so glad I came, Sarah.
we're gonna have a great time.
I just sat my first two patrons.
Yeah, I saw that. You put them at a 4-top instead of a deuce.
you can't do that when we're overbooked.
you only put 2 people at a 4-top when there are no empty deuces.
Oh, and I need you to tell everybody on the floor we're eighty-six on the Dover sole. Okay.
I have no idea what you're talking about right now, but I'm incredibly turned on.
well, apparently, both of you Walker boys find restaurant work arousing. You know about Justin?
Yeah, I caught him making out in the storage room this morning.
Oh, my God. He's dedicated. Yeah.
he finished up his hanky-panky in the walk-in cooler.
I just hope he knows what he's doing.
that Kimberly girl is a little wacky.
I thought her name was Angie.
Angie... my sous-chef?
no wonder she keeps disappearing.
who's Kimberly? Kimberly's the waitress with the southern accent and the gun collection. Are you serious?
Yeah. You need to talk to him. Tell him to knock it off.
I can't have him two-timing my staff. How many guns?
I don't know. She's from Texas. Kevin, you gotta get out there. Okay, wish me luck.
if you see Angie, tell her I need her in the kitchen now.
all right. You might wanna hide the knives.
Portugal... - Yeah.
I've always wanted to go there.
I lived in Paris most of my life, but I still have the strong bond to my home country.
you know, Luc never mentioned he's half-Portuguese.
I'd be surprised to hear that he mentions anything about me at all.
I'm sorry. - Luc doesn't approve the life I've led.
that's why I'm here...
to see if I can repair what's broken with us, to meet Sarah...
and to give them my blessing.
but he just pushes me away.
Oh, God. I know how painful that is.
look, my son Tommy and I went through a very rough patch.
but listen, with a little patience and a big nudge from Sarah and me, maybe we can help you and Luc work this out.
that'll make me so happy.
let's go find Sarah. I'm sure she's out of her meeting by now.
I used up too much of your time already.
look, I'll get my luggage and take a taxi back to the hotel. Hotel?
Yeah, Luc doesn't want me interrupting his work.
that's okay. It's better that way, that I give him some air. No, no, no, no, no, no.
there will be no hotels and there will be no taxis.
I really want you to be a guest at my house...
I have plenty of room... and for as long as you like.
Oh, you are so kind.
I do have one little engagement this evening, but that'll give you time to get unpacked and settled.
and who is that adorable man?
Karl. That's... Karl.
Dr. Karl west. He's a psychotherapist.
I always fall in love with my analysts.
there is just something about them, you know?
uh, you know, the...
the engagement I have this evening is with Karl.
Oh, you're lovers!
no. No?
not exactly. Not exactly?
maybe. Maybe?
I'm not sure. I am sure.
you cannot let the handsome doctor get away. Come on.
don't be silly.
women are friends with women, men are friends with men, and gay persons are friends with everybody.
well, I don't know if I think that's completely true, but there is the bigger issue, that Karl and I work together.
I don't understand what you mean.
well, mixing business with pleasure is frowned upon.
only Americans find an excuse to frown on pleasure.
it's crazy.
all right, let me be completely honest with you.
look, you've had three marriages and lots of lovers.
Mm. I-I just don't think you've experienced much rejection in your life, and once you reach a certain age, it's scary to stick your wrinkly old neck out there again.
if it scares you, then you should probably do it.
and I have experienced in my life very painful rejection from my only son.
so I do know it.
Oh, Gabriela, I'm so sorry.
I've had three husbands.
you've had five children.
so please help me.
give me an advice.
okay, first of all, you and Luc aren't gonna solve anything until you can spend some time together and talk.
let's invite Luc and Sarah over for dinner tonight.
tonight? Yes, tonight. The sooner, the better.
here... neutral territory. I'll help you cook, and then I'll slip away and go see Karl, and the three of you can have some serious time together.
but what if he won't come?
he will come. I'll talk to Sarah.
now when Luc was small.
Moroccan. Yeah.
he loved Moroccan food.
and I used to cook for him all the time morn food.
he was very little, 7 or 8, but he used to love it.
then Moroccan it is.
Yes! Okay, tell me what we need.
and someone named Jennifer called, twice, on the reservation line.
you have a last name?
uh, no. Why, is there more than one Jennifer?
there can never be enough Jennifers.
okay, you know what? You're actually now out of control.
now you have Jennifers coming out of your ears. You wanna tell me what's going on?
I don't know what's going on. I'm not doing anything different.
it feels like I'm in a "Girls Gone Wild" video. - Oh, come on.
no, I'm serious. I'm not even hitting on these girls.
they're just coming on to me. It's like I'm giving off, like...
like a musk or something... Or the army did some breeding experiment on me.
it's awesome. Would you listen to yourself?
Kevin, there's something going on. I don't know what it is, but I'm certainly not gonna stop it.
you have to stop, okay? Because you've had your fun.
no. Okay? I haven't had my fun.
you named your penis Captain Happy?
Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask little big man?
I can't believe I told you that.
you didn't tell me.
you told Tommy, and then Tommy told me.
here's the thing... Scotty is freaking out there's gonna be some kind of catfight in the dish room, okay? Tell him not to be nervous. All right?
I have this figured out. Angie works lunches, and Kimberly now works the dinner shift.
they're never gonna cross paths.
is it too much to ask you schedule your hookups on your own time? Oh, Kev... No, that's fine. That's fair.
thank you. I forget. What was Tommy's?
the magnificent seven. Yeah, right. He wishes.
and three boxes of couscous. She is going to make
Luc's favorite Moroccan dinner tonight.
Oh, mom, that is a great idea.
have you ever asked him why he's so resentful of her?
Oh, he's so vague about it.
she is self-centered, she's overly dramatic.
it's nothing we all haven't been through.
excuse me? - That came out wrong. Yeah.
do you think you can get him to come? Absolutely.
mom, it's a serious red flag for me when a man doesn't get along with his mother.
it is not a healthy sign. Honey, you know Dr. Karl, at the station? Oh, yeah. I met him this afternoon. Nice guy.
he wrote this really wonderful, wonderful article about how men often seek to recreate their maternal relationships by the women they choose to marry.
it's so interesting. You gotta get me that.
I will. So 7: 30 tonight, okay?
okay. Okay, mom. We'll see you then.
who are we seeing?
mom. She invited us to dinner tonight.
and who is "us"? - You and me... And your mother.
Unh-unh. No. I'm way too busy tonight.
Oh, come on, Luc. She's traveled so far to see us, and she's making your favorite Moroccan dinner. You've gotta go.
Oh, this is typical. I don't like Moroccan food.
she likes Moroccan food. She doesn't even cook, Sarah.
Luc, you're gonna have to talk to her sooner or later.
let's just go over there tonight...
if I'm done with all my work, then I'll go. Okay?
okay. Okay. We don't have to be there right at 7: 30.
we... we... we could go later.
Gabriela? I'm back.
in here!
well, I thought you were gonna start chopping the onions, at least preheat the oven.
we have a huge, big lamb roast to cook.
Wow. Look at this.
I borrowed some little things from outside, some little things from upstairs, and voil? What do you think?
it looks like a Bedouin tent.
Yes. I wanted to make it as romantic as possible.
for Luc and Sarah?
No! I have a surprise for you.
Karl called. His television cable went kaput, and I told him yes, of course.
isn't that perfect? It's gonna be a party!
Oh, no, no, no, no. Look, it isn't a party.
no, this is serious.
Oh, nothing is so serious that you cannot enjoy yourself while you're doing it.
well, you can't mix Leonard Bernstein and the... and the queen of the gypsies.
Hey. What are you so mad at me for?
I didn't kaput his television.
good. Okay. You call him. You tell him not to come.
that would be rude.
Yeah, and also be stupid, because you love him.
this roast is gonna take at least two and a half hours to cook.
that means we won't be eating till almost 10: 00, and the only appetizers we have are olives and dates.
no candles. - Oh, well, try the pantry, right over there.
Oh, oh, 10: 00 is perfect.
Oh, look, Gabriela, this... this whole thing has gone haywire.
I-I think we have to go back to the original plan.
the whole point of this was so you can Luc could sit down, spend some time together, and sort things out, and Karl and I could have a nice, quiet evening together.
Yeah, of course, but, look, we cannot just jump into the heavy talk.
we should keep things light at first.
what? - You have absinthe.
Oh, my God. That thing must be 10 or 15 years old.
I forgot it was even in there.
do you know, Nora, I'm gonna make my famous absinthe tea.
and do you know the secret of my absinthe tea?
no. - There is no tea in it!
w-when did you tell Karl to get here? - 00.
Oh, no! I haven't had time to change.
I smell like lamb fat, for God sakes!
no, you look great. You're a natural beauty.
you're fantastic. Voil?
let's go. Let's go and meet your man. Come on. Come on.
it's good.
Hi. Come on in.
thank you. It's a beautiful house.
this is... this is for you.
thank you. - Sure.
um, Karl, um...
I would like you to meet my friend, Gabriela Laurent.
Chante. - am so... speechless.
is one of my favorite films.
I can't believe you know my film.
well, I'm a bit of a francophile and a cinephile, so I've seen all of the French new wave.
I can't believe I'm actually standing here, talking to the Gabriela Laurent. Oh.
you were in a film? Yeah, when I was very young.
a director discovered me at a little caf? on Saint-Germain.
what's the name of the film?
the Rhapsody of the Flesh.
Yeah. Oh.
so let's all get in, and I'll make you both a drink.
what a wonderful surprise.
wonderful surprise!
Angie! Hey.
Hi. I didn't... I didn't know you were working tonight. Yeah, I'm covering for Nick.
Yeah, I... I brought you some hot tea for your throat.
I put honey and... and lemon in it. Uh, for... for my throat?
Yeah. Kevin said you were coming down with the flu.
Oh, he did? No, no, no.
he totally has me confused with someone else.
so you're not getting a cold sore?
a cold... No! I'm not getting a cold sore. No.
my lips are totally fine.
Oh! Okay. That's a relief. Yeah.
you know, a hundred years ago, people believed that... that absinthe could drive you insane.
well, if that's true, then you're here to cure us. Mm.
well, don't worry about me.
I think people should go a little crazy now and then.
Hello? Oh. Hi. Hello.
Wow. This... this is nice.
Sarah, where's Luc?
Oh. Uh, Luc had a lot of work.
he's really sorry he couldn't make it.
no, Gabriela. Gabriela, we can do this again tomorrow night.
he just can't stand to be in the same room with me.
Oh, no. No, no. That... that... that's not true.
wh-what have I done for him to despise me so much?
he doesn't. He does not despise you. He's gonna come around.
he's gonna come around. Mom's right.
he... he... he's gonna come around. You'll see.
Gabriela, listen.
I want you to take a deep breath, okay?
now you're amongst friends, okay?
if there's anything we can do to help you, you just say so.
there you go.
better?
what did you say to them?! -Nothing.
Kevin, I'm doing my job. I'm being friendly.
what happened? I had a party of four women waiting for a table.
when I go to seat them, all of a sudden, they're no longer hungry.
they wanna eat peanuts at the bar.
okay. So now I'm losing customers. Justin, this has to stop. - Yeah.
you guys act like I can control this. - Justin?
are you okay? - Yeah.
do you have a fever? Oh, let me feel your forehead, you poor baby.
kimberly, I'm fine. Thank you.
I don't know. You feel a little warm to me.
then again, I think you always run a little hot.
uh, Kimberly, you know what? Table seven... - Uh, Angie, would you mind going to the storeroom...
needs, uh, more water right now. Thank you. - Getting me some lentils? Thanks.
great.
go home.
what? - You heard me. Out of here.
look, that fever thing is Kevin's fault. Take over the bar.
What?! - Justin, leave through the back door and don't speak to anyone.
Scotty, you're acting like this is my fault. Go!
okay. - Way to go, Captain Happy.
now!
mom, why is Dr. Karl here?
it's a long story.
well, I'm glad he came. He put Gabriela back in a party mood, though this absinthe probably didn't hurt.
why are you cooking? I thought she was making dinner.
she was in charge of the couscous. Ew.
I rest my case. I may not be a French film star, but I guess I'm good for something.
Luc, never mentioned anything to me about a film.
if Dr. Karl hadn't have brought it up, I would never have known.
I think he's attracted to her.
it's just my luck.
I finally find a man I'm interested in, and "The Rhapsody of the Flesh" shows up.
you're interested in Dr. Karl? Mom, why didn't you tell me?
well, I didn't wanna put you in an awkward situation.
you're practically my boss.
Oh, for God sake, mom, don't worry about that.
have you told him how you feel?
no. No. Well, not in so many words. Has he told you?
he invited me to watch a television program with him tonight, but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen.
no, mom, get out there. Stake your claim. I have a lamb to baste and a pot of couscous to make.
mom, I will baste, and I will couscous. Go on. You go out and have fun.
you might want to hurry up.
I am feeling so much better.
you know, your friend, Dr. Karl...
helping me a lot.
I'm so glad.
Yeah. So now you come and dance with me. Come on.
Oh, no.
no. You're... you're really welcome to join us as we watch the Leonard Bernstein program...
with us. It's... it's... it's almost ready to start.
is it that time already? Oh, my goodness.
well, I-I, you know, I feel... I feel terrible.
I don't wanna break up this wonderful party for my... my t-television show. But maybe you and I could watch, uh, Leonard Bernstein together some other time?
of course. Of course.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Nora? Yeah?
now you and I will dance for Karl.
Oh, boy, that sounds like fun. No.
Nora, Nora, please. Please. No, no, no. Nora, Nora, no, no, no. Please, please. Come on.
come on. Come on. I'll dance, Nora. I'll dance if you will.
please. I have a lamb to look at.
Nora! I'll teach you!
I quit. She wins. I can't compete with that.
I'm not exotic or sexy or European.
mom, don't give up. Just go out there and... and... and you be you.
Mm. It's fine. It's fine.
I'll just stay in here and baste and stir and hope that Karl notices me for my cooking.
mom, you listen to me. This is what's gonna happen...
I am gonna go out there,
I am gonna lure Gabriela away from Dr. Karl...
Yeah. Then you come in and you make your move.
I have no move.
buck up!
where is Nora? She's missing all the fun.
I don't understand her and all this rules about how you can't mix business and pleasures and you can only be friends with a man you work with.
she said that? - Mm-hmm. Isn't that crazy?
well... Hey, Sarah! Come. Dance with us.
Oh, you know, I would love to, but we've run out of your fabulous absinthe tea, so I was hoping that you could come back and mix up another batch. Oh, no. We're not out. We have the whole pitcher right here.
Where's Nora? Yes. Tell her to come and dance with us.
I'll see if I can find her. Sarah.
what the hell is going on here?
what are you doing here? I came to pick up my phone charger, and I-I figured mom would be asleep, but she's in the kitchen half-sloshed, looking like someone died.
and don't look now, but who is the woman doing the dance of the seven veils on our coffee table?
okay. Listen to me. I need your help.
I know this sounds weird, but I need you to go in there and get her away from him, okay?
just distract her. What do you mean, distract her?
just go with it! Okay, Sarah, what are you talk...
mom. W-what are you doing?
a little lamb died for no good reason.
mom, you gotta pull yourself together.
you-you're gonna go out there, and you tell him how you feel.
I feel... like an idiot.
mom, he has come over here to see you, okay?
so you go out there and you talk to him.
he's by himself. The coast is clear.
Nora? Sorry. Um, there's someone at the front door, Nora.
I'll get it.
are you okay? You... you... you disappeared.
just doing some cooking.
Oh, I-I feel terrible.
I mean, you've been in here slaving away, and we've been out there, you know, kicking up our heels. You're just doing your job, helping a woman in distress.
well, I'm here to help you now. Okay?
so let's put this on.
you tell me... what I can...
I think this, uh, absinthe interferes with motor... Functions.
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Oh, no! No. No. No. I-I-I di... I didn't see that coming.
Oh, my God. It's just that I thought you just wanted to be friends.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No.
Justin? - Justin, what the hell are you doing?!
you told me to go with it. - This is Luc's mother.
What?! Why didn't you tell me it's...
Sarah and Nora asked me to come and talk to you.
I didn't want to, but I thought I would try one more time.
and here you are. You could not give me a real family when I was growing up, and now that I finally found one, you come here and you tear it apart.
Luc, I came here to be with your family, not tear it apart.
you have no idea how to be in a family!
you can't be part of anything that is not completely about you!
I don't want you in this family! Luc...
Hey, mom. It's, uh, it's Justin.
and I just wanna let you know that I put everyone's keys in the breakfast nook 'cause I didn't want anyone driving.
and I hope you're all feeling better this morning.
and again, I'm really, really sorry about last night.
all right. Love you, mom. Bye.
Kevin told me, uh, things got pretty wild at your mom's.
Yeah.
apparently, Sarah's pretty pissed.
I know. Aw, man.
is everything okay?
Yeah.
God, look, it's just, I...
I feel like I've been under such stress and that I'm finally able to be myself and... and relax a little bit for the first time in a long time.
and, you know, I don't know, I got a little carried away, and I didn't stop and think how it could affect other people, like you.
so... Scotty, I'm sorry.
I appreciate that.
and not to be a hypocritical boss, but I am officially putting a moratorium on workplace hookups. I endorse that 100%, and I will come clean with Angie and Kimberly.
good.
you know about, um, her gun collection, right?
gun collection?
Kimberly. Gun, like, real?
real. Wow.
Oh. Oh. Hi. You're awake.
Yeah. Good morning.
I thought maybe you could use a cup of coffee.
Oh, thank you very much. Here. I know I sure can.
uh, here are your car keys. Oh, great.
okay. Nora. Nora, please.
I need to explain about... No, you don't. You don't need to explain anything.
look, I value our friendship very much, and I love working with you.
I-I hope you can just forget about that stupid move of mine in there.
it was completely inappropriate.
could you... could you just sit down, please?
look, Noraã€‚
I was under the apparently mistaken impression that you were committed to our relationship being platonic.
so when you tried to kiss me, I was surprised for a moment, and... and then when I got my wits about me, y-you'd run away.
what, you...
you don't want to be just platonic?
no. No, no. I was hoping that Leonard Bernstein would give me the courage... To kiss you.
Really?
well, then what the heck was all of that with Gabriela?
I mean, you seemed to be having a really good time with her.
we were, but she is a classic narcissist.
I mean, nobody is more fun at a party, but, you know, they're incurable.
and you should never, ever get in a relationship with one.
well, there you go again, making me feel better.
Oh, Karl.
this is all very complicated because we work together, and I don't want to lose your friendship, whatever happens between us.
I will always be your friend.
you awake?
Yeah, unfortunately.
when will I learn not to drink on an empty stomach?
I'm sorry I was so angry with you last night.
I wanted to apologize when I got home, but it was too late to call.
that's okay. I'm sorry I butted in on your relationship with your mother.
you were right. I should have come when you asked me to.
I could have put a stop to these things before it got out of hand, for sure.
no. I think it would have turned to hell no matter what.
Luc, I understand that you're angry with her, but I don't understand why you can't talk to me about it.
what do you want to know? - Everything.
anything that would help me understand the two of you.
that will take a very long time.
why didn't you tell me that your mother was in a film?
what else was more important to her than you?
when I was 6 years old, she left my father for another man.
she moved away, left us both.
it was great for a while...
at least, until she left again...
for another man.
look, she broke my father's heart, over and over.
and she broke your heart, too.
Wow. Listen, Luc, I... I'm not gonna tell you what you should do, but maybe you can think about who she is now.
you're probably right.
she will never be the mother that she should have been.
Yeah.
Gabriela, no. No, no, no. You... you don't have to leave.
I'm not angry, honestly.
I didn't realize he was your son.
look, it was all just a huge misunderstanding.
and... and Justin is a grown-up.
he... he's allowed to kiss whomever he wants.
Yeah. Well, as you said, last night, things went haywires.
me by Karl, you by Luc...
and so we just slipped back into our comfort zones.
you danced, and I cooked.
Yeah. And I made my son furious with me again.
he's like all the men in my life.
and they ask me to leave.
well, why do you think that is?
he... he's immune to my charms.
well, Luc is your son.
you can't charm him or dazzle him with your charisma.
and hope for the best.
I think it's just too late for me.
so... I'm here to apologize to you.
you don't have to apologize to me.
you should talk to Kimberly and Angie and mom.-I did already.
all right? I get it. I was a jerk. You were right.
well, I was a little hard on you.
Yeah, I can understand that.
but you... you and Scotty are better, right?
we're getting through it... you know, good days and bad.
I don't know how lucky I felt at the time.
Yes, but I put Captain happy on probation.
Yeah. You still working the lunch shift?
Yes, but this is my final week. I gave Scotty my notice.
Oh. Funny. I don't think he's gonna miss me.
don't take it too bad. He fired me, so I'm gonna sue him.
all right.
yeah? - What's Luc's mom like?
Oh, she's hot.
down, boy. - Right.
good.
so I want to get my phone and call the kids.
Oh, here you two are. Good morning. - Good morning.
Karl, I don't think you officially met Luc.
nice to meet you.
likewise. And I'm sorry about everything that happened.
no, no, no. Please. Please. No... no problem, not at all.
is my mother up yet? -Yes. She's in the kitchen.
she insisted on cleaning up the mess from last night.
that will take some doing.
excuse me.
is that a good sign or a bad sign?
good, I think. I hope.
well, at least they're talk. It's a start.
that's definitely not talking.
Oh, boy. - Well... well, maybe she dropped it accidentally.
no. No, that one was on purpose.
mom, I'll pay for anything that gets broken. God.
you know, the French are very expressive.
please tell me that that does not apply here.
Oh, boy. Well, if you're asking me if you're like Gabriela.
I would say, probably not.
I mean, she's a little insecure, self-obsessed, a bit histrionic... - A bit?
I'd say that Luc is a very smart man.
he chose a mate who has all of his mother's best traits.
you are very good.
I feel like I owe you 100 bucks.
more like $220, but don't worry about it.
listen.
Oh, God. I hope that doesn't mean that they're both unconscious.
Sarah, come here. I want you to look at this.- What?
just go look.
are you tired of feeling old?
do you miss waking up with vim and vigor?
seniors, the first step to a healthy tomorrow "is to get a good range of vitamins and nutrients "in your diet.
forever tabs can help you do just that.
forever tabs?
Frank, good god. Are you serious?
well, who doesn't want a little more vim and vigor?
just pick it up from the end, Nora.
Yes, Frank, from the end.
forever tabs can help you do just that.
I use them." No, I don't use them.
all you have to do is take one pill, and you're legally clear.
"them" is plural, Frank.
then take two. - I take four.
but look, if you want me to do the spot, I'll do the spot.
they asked for her on this one.
why is that? Am I more senior than he is?
hardly.
let's...
do the, uh, hotel spot.
Nora, they're offering rooms for half price.
I'll get you some more water and give you a second to look it over.
all right.
Oh, good god in heaven.
what?
Frank, I can't say this.
Nora, Nora, Nora, what is it?
Oh, god. This is so cheesy.
I'm embarrassed to even read it to you.
it can't be that bad.
the hotel velone We make the beds, you make the magic.
Ooh, that's- That's pretty catchy, actually.
Oh, yeah, there's more. - Yeah?
turndown service comes with a boat of strawberries in every room. -strawberries.
what the hell would you do with that? - Oh,they're high in vitamin c.
what?
there are windows on all four sides of this room.
so?
we're adults.Your daughter owns the station.
I mean,how much trouble can we get in to?
Oh.Well,thank you.
is it your birthday or something?
No.Why?
and then today out of nowhere...Whip.
So,uh,i thought it might be a special occasion.
no.i just thought that I would, you know,try something new.
a deconstruction of american politics.
that sounds political.
it is. I'm...I'm teaching a seminar.
uh, I'm more into fiction myself.
you know, I guess I'd rather read something interesting than true.
Really? Well
why do you think they can't be both?
baby got stuck in a white house bathtub, and they had to pry him out with a big board?
that's all you got?
warren harding had sex in a white house closet, died of ptomaine poisoning, and rumor had it that his wife murdered him.
not bad. Not bad.
so, um, if you had to choose of all our presidents, which one would you have slept with?
Lincoln.
Really? Lincoln? Interesting.
they named a bedroom after him.
I'm Seth, by the way.
Kitty.
when you were trying to adopt, how much weight did you gain?
please tell me you're not emotionally eating.
well, that depends if you think a cannoli, two bear claws, and a lindzer torte constitutes breakfast.
you guys are shoe-ins. The social worker is going to love you.
well, what if she hates us?
one bad impression is all it takes.
everything has to be perfect.
you and Scotty are a foster adoption dream team.
I'm a nervous guy, okay?
okay, for a child What if there's a flood?
Oh, my god. This barista is totally hitting on me.
kit, I'm in the middle of a crisis here.
Oh, no, you're not, and besides, this is gonna take your mind off of it.
Oh, okay. What does he look like?
he's very cute in a genius bar kind of way.
Oh, a brownie. Hallelujah.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
he wrote his number on my coffee cup.
what do I do?
that's Sarah. I gotta go. bye.
wait, Kevin? Kevin?
Hi, queen of all media.
I just saw mom making out with our on-air psychiatrist in the studio.
you gonna fire her?
no, I wouldn't have just cause.
but it would be fun.
I can't believe you work with mom.
I don't. She's an employee of one radio station of five that I own.
she's a very small ant in my kingdom.
now why did you call earlier?
I wanted to know good preschools in l. a...
just in case the social worker asks what we're thinking in terms of education.
you know, there is such a thing as being overly prepared.
now listen, I'm trying to get outta here.
Luc's off to china tomorrow, so if you don't have anything else - oh, right.
so what are the plans for tonight?
I'm gonna surprise Luc with something special.
like what? - Well, if I tell you, it won't be a surprise for very long, will it?
I think this brownie was a little much. I better go.
the what?
what? - What?
Oh, nothing.
Sarah, honey, I-I hope you're not upset about the - Mom, you can kiss anyone you want at work, okay?
I never let it stop me.
no, me neither.
Oh, for god sake, Sarah.
would you please warn me when there are other people in the room?
don't worry, mom. I have to go.
say good-bye to Luc for me, Sarah.
okay, bye.
good luck today, honey.
Bye.
Sarah, why won't you let me have everyone over tonight so we can celebrate Luc?
I mean, he's painting a mural in shanghal.
Thanks, mom, but no.
tonight is strictly Luc and me.
anyway, won't you be busy?
what do you mean by that?
okay. If you don't want to talk about karl...
I like him so much.
I like him so much.
I'm, like, completely and utterly falling head over heels.
in love?
no. Down the stairs.
what do you think?
mom, that's fantastic.
we've been to dinners and lunches and movies.
anything else?
no. - oh.
but that's not so important right now.
no, no. That's not important.
that's why you were making out in the studio.
well, of of course it's important.
but look, I've been through some things over the past years, and I-I don't mind taking it slow.
there's nothing wrong with slow.
nothing wrong with slow.
slow is good.
slow is good.
can we enjoy this? Foster adoption is supposed to be joyful.
it's about starting a family.
okay, but we have to control the variables.
you know, strangers come into this restaurant every day.
Kevin, they're customers.
all right. But is that a safe environment for a child?
I mean, what if there's a flood?
we're getting a visit from the social worker, not the fbi.
Oh, we need to get fingerprinted, too.
don't worry. The fbi is coming.
Scotty, have you seen my bag?
uh, no.
Kevin? - no.
it was a little brown bag with a brownie in it.
Oh, yeah. I ate it.
what? I saw it. I was hungry.
it all happened so fast after that.
I'll buy you a new one.
you can't, actually.
uh, my prescription's up.
that was the last of my stash.
thanks a lot.
prescription for what?
medical marijuana. It's for his back.
look up.
uh, hey. Uh, what's, uh, what's-what's up?
well, I just wanted to make sure that you gave me the right number.
you're so hot.
I know. I know.
how old are you?
Oh, my god. You're 27.
do you hit on a lot of older women?
no, and you're not old.
Oh, my god. You're sweet.
okay. - What?
that was fun.
look, uh, call me sometime.
I knew you would call back.
you slept with a 20 year old?
27, and no I didn't sleep with him.
we just made out.
then why did you type that you hooked up?
hooking up can mean anything from making out to casual sex.
Yeah, well, next time, could you be more specific?
because I am a very busy woman.
okay. He's a barista in a coffee shop.
Oh. Of course he is.
what's his name ? Taylor, Tyler...Scooter?
actually, I don't even remember.
who are you right now?
I don't know.
I guess I'm lucky.
I guess I'm fabulous.
where did you make out?
on top of the coffee beans.
Oh, my god.
and I thought I was risqu?
I know. Can you even believe it?
I mean, I am so proud of myself.
I am usually so decorous and appropriate and-and...
I don't know. I don't know...
excuse me, but the maitre d' at the restaurant gave me this key.
just Kitty, I gotta go.
I'm in a very important meeting.
you are such a liar, Sarah.
I know that Luc is there with you.
good-bye.
meet me for lunch at hotel velone"?
wouldn't you prefer room service?
how's the menu?
it is...
extensive.
hello.
I'm Sarah.
I am your hostess for today...
this evening...
and tomorrow morning.
would you like to start with an appetizer?
Oh, yeah.
anything blow the waist is considered a tip.
okay.
excuse me, ms. Mccallister?
Oh, dean whitley, hi. Hello.
Oh, please do not stand.
Oh, no, please. You have come all the way down to the political science department.
the least I can do is give you a proper greeting.
and I think it's you who came all the way down to wexley university.
when I heard that you agreed to offer this seminar,
I ran out on my balcony to watch the liberal biasof higher education shift slightly back to center.
well, I'm very happy that I can provide some balance.
and perhaps when some of these eager young minds meet a brilliant republican role model and listen to her lectures and talk to her at the coffee shop
Yes, yes. Well, I just want you to know that I-I am so looking forward to this opportunity.
good.
now if you ever need anything, please remember to call me.
and, um, oh, oh, I forgot to tell you.
the alumni association's having a fund-raiser next month, and they're hoping you will agree to be on the host committee.
whatever I can do to help.
good. I will tell them to call you.
and it was just lovely seeing you again.
thank you. Thank you.
I am going to walk you out, because I have a very sudden desire for a cup of coffee.
how are you feeling?
I am so stoned right now.
you have to help me.
okay, Kevin, why don't you go lie down in the bedroom or something?
because the social worker's gonna be here any minute.
no, I told you. She's not coming until tomorrow.
people like me do not deserve children.
I should be behind bars, Scotty.
I'm gonna turn myself in.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
I've only been stoned ever once before in my life.
I thought I should try pot before I went to college, so I bought a joint from Ozzie Archibald.
it was as big as a cigar.
okay, that's called a blunt.
I made sure no one was home, and then I went out to the yard and I smoked it.
you smoked the whole thing?
half. I don't know.
I buried the rest in justin's old sandbox, just in case the police found it.
then I locked myself in my room, read an old spanish textbook, 'cause I thought if I could just focus on something, anything...
then mom came home I'm starting to freak out again.
okay, Kevin, breathe. Come sit down.
she needed help with the groceries, so I had to go back into the kitchen,
and then she started speaking in spanish.
Really? - Yeah.
there must have been something else in that joint.
well, I don't know. I don't do drugs.
I have to find Sarah.
Sarah? - Yeah. Sarah.
Wh-Sarah?
when Sarah came back, she immediately saw how baked I was, and she managed to get me from paranoid schizophrenic into groggy, stupid, and hungry.
okay, well, wh-what did she do?
I don't know.
I have to call her.
you can't call Sarah.
she's got some big extravaganza with Luc tonight.
well, you're starting to speak in spanish, so I don't have a choice.
I can't believe I forgot my glasses.
this is painful.
like trying to read the nutritional information on the back of a cereal box.
here. Try mine.
Oh, thank you.
what a gentleman.
always happy to help a damsel in distress.
I've been thinking...
about us.
Really? Me, too.
Really?
what if we don't order anything?
I mean, what if we do something totally insane?
let's...
check in to hotel velone.
I mean, they're having this promotion, rooms are half off.
are you serious?
Oh, for heaven sake, Nora.
I mean, it's obviously been a while since I asked a woman to, you know, anything like this, so...
well, I'm glad you did.
I'm-I'm...
I'm really very glad you did.
it's just that, if we're gonna do this...
yes?
spend the night together...
Ah, yes.
my apartment is boring and - Well, why don't we go to my place?
I've been there before. Remember?
as were most of your children, various family members.
Yes, well...
they do have a tendency to show up every now and then.
I'd have to I have to go home first.
me, too.
so what do you think?
they make the beds...
we make the magic.
I wasn't expecting a honeymoon until after we were married.
call it a sneak preview.
Oh, god.
I'm so - Oh...
Luc, I'm so sorry.
it's okay. It's okay. - Let me get some ice.
I'll get you a towel.
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry.
hello. Hey, kev.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
it was a surprise.
no, we're fine.
Yeah, at hotel velone.
weird.
uh, Kevin just hung up on me.
please tell me that you didn't tell him where we were.
uh, so what if I did?
well, then it would only be a matter of time before they come over.
they'll want to see the room.
gay people love this hotel.
all right.
I'm sorry, babe.
I know you want tonight to be perfect, but no one is coming over here, not even your brother.
Yes, well, even so, I think we should have all cell phones off.
complete radio silence.
honey, I am so sorry.
let me see.
it's bleeding.
if this is a sneak preview, I can only imagine what a real honeymoon is gonna be like.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, yeah.
that's really...
Yeah. Yeah, no, don't, don't stop.
that...
you know, I used to love watching that show that you did, the, uh,"red, white, and blue.
are you serious?
you have known who I am this entire time?
was I not supposed to?
fine. Fine. I don't care.
just keep massaging my hand. - That's what I thought.
So...Do you, uh...
do you remember my name?
you know, I-i-I don't think you ever told me your name.
Yes, I did. - No, you didn't.
Yes, I did. - Okay, what is it?
it's Seth. - Seth. Seth.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Wait a minute.
stop. Stop, stop, stop.
I don't-I don't-my god, what am I doing here?
you're having fun. You're having fun.
just relax. Just relax.
there you go.
okay. Well, if you keep doing that, I actually might fall asleep.
that's...
that's not what I had in mind.
okay, you know what?
you're, like, out of a porno movie.
I mean, I'm surprised you didn't show up here with a pizza.
you know what? Now you're talking.
I'm starving. I can get a pizza.
you know, I have to go out anyway if, uh - why do you have to go out anyway?
it's kind of embarrassing, but I only brought two condoms.
Oh, well, hurry up.
all right. - Just hurry up.
hello. Luc. Hi, um, it's Scotty.
we're kind of downstairs in the lobby.
they make me feel better.
I want to hold one.
he really needs to see Sarah.
Yes. Thank you. Okay.
we'll be up in two minutes. Bye.
okay, let's go.

thank you so much.
housekeeping should be done cleaning soon.
I'm sorry about the mess - my name's, uh, west.
Dr. West.
Oh, what a surprise.

just sign here, sir.
you'll be in room 714.
wait.
Ar-are you here with my mother?
no.
no, I no, I I'm working on a book.
I sometimes, I check in to a hotel...
so I can focus better.
I work best alone.
Oh, you don't live alone?
Yeah.
but, um, my-my neighbors are-are doing this massive kitchen remodel, and the noise So I decided to splurge on a little peace and quiet.
it's half off.
what brings you here?
Oh, my fianc?
is going on a long business trip, so, you know, we wanted to have a romantic night, just the two of us.
um, look, I won't keep you.
nice to see you, karl.
Oh, Dr. West, would you like the complimentary strawberries and cream?
Yeah, I-I think she'd like that.
good luck with your book.
Oh, my god.
I gotta call mom.
I just ran into karl west downstairs checking in, ordering strawberries.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm so sorry.
I know we're intruding.
but I didn't know where else we could go.
we?
Kevin is in the bathroom.
Oh, no.
he ate a pot brownie.
Oh, god.
it was an accident.
come out here.
I'm so sorry.
it's just, last time this happened, you somehow helped me get through it.
are people speaking spanish?
s? Un poquito.
Oh, god. I thought we should help.
I'm so pathetic. I'm so sorry.
look, I know you can't help me.
I have to find my own way home.
no, Kevin. Lie down.
okay. - We'll get you some coffee or something, okay?
Yeah. Oh, coffee.
is that what you did last time?
I don't remember, but his problems are way more serious than that right now.
the police are outside.
no, they're not. - Yes, they are.
I passed them on the way up A whole s. w.a. t.Team headed this way.
that's ridiculous.
hotels have dogs to catch people like you, Kevin.
what am I supposed to do?
you gotta pull it together.
what's your birthday?
uh, april 18, 1971.
mother's maiden name?
last 4 of your social?
is that right? - I'm not sure.
you feel better now?
Yeah. A-a little. Maybe. I guess.
that's what I did last time.
I just scared the crap out of him.
something about the adrenaline shot.
I gotta call mom.
Hey, Sarah, don't get involved.
what's going on with mom?
Karl just checked in to the hotel for an afternoon romp.
Oh, with mom?
wait. She's here? Oh, my god. I'm freaking out again.
no, not with mom. See? That's the point.
what's the point?
Dr. Karl that's who I should call.
I should call Dr. Karl.
don't get involved with your mother's romantic relationship.
I'm not gonna let this guy break her heart.
you don't even know what's going on.
you didn't see him.
he was like a deer in the headlights.
Kevin doesn't even look as guilty as this guy.
Sarah, I'm warning you.
why don't you two take mr. Hemphead for a walk, sober him up?
and what about our romantic evening?
okay, sweetheart. Come on. Let's go. Let's get up.
I'll take care of them.
do what you need to do.
don't pet the dogs, Kevin.
hello.
honey, I I'm sorry to bother you.
I I tried to call Sarah, but I think she turned her phone off.
Oh, hello, mom.
how are you?
never mind, honey. Never mind.
I really shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Oh, okay. Well, then I'll talk to you later.
W-W-W-Wait.
just because I shouldn't be talking to you about this doesn't mean I'm not going to talk to you about this.
okay. Well...What's wrong?
it just...
Karl and I figured it was time for us to...
like you kids say,"hook up.
you're right.
this is so not appropriate.
please listen.
so-so we made a date to do just that, and I-it just is making me so nervous.
we're making such a big deal out of it.
it's all so premeditated.
Oh, my god. Please tell me that you didn't go to some hotel or something.
no. No. No, we wouldn't do something as stupid as that.
I mean, why make a nerve-racking situation worse?
there is nothing for you to be afraid of. Okay?
people have been having sex for thousands of years.
I know.
but the whole point is, up until now, karl and I have not been one of 'em.
sweetie, I've got to go.
okay? Thanks. Thanks for talking to me.
I'll-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
what floor?
uh, 7.
I'm so sorry.
what happened to you?
you would think a a pizza boy would know how to carry his stuff without dumping it all over people.
you want me get to some club soda or something for you?
no, no, don't-don't bother.
it's a-it's a lost cause.
poor kid. I felt sorry for him.
I'm-I'm sorry i'm-i'm late.
everything always takes a little longer than you think.
I can-I can never figure out these key cards.
you know, they go in...
right. - Weird and...
what a nice room.
there is the boat of strawberries we were promised.
and-and some mints that's nice.
and, um, adjustable lighting is mm.
is always a good thing.
you're nervous. Aren't you?
Yes, I am. Aren't you?
of course. Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's okay.
you know, I'm-I'm soaking wet, and I'm-and I'm sticky, so I'm just gonna, um, i'm gonna just be right back, okay?
just be right back.
hello.
Karl, it's Sarah.
um, how can I help you?
I'm not gonna pretend I don't know what you're doing in this hotel.
but you should know one thing.
my mother has real feelings for you.
so if you lead her on, you won't just have me to answer to.
there are five of us, and we look out for each other. Okay?
I have to go.
good-bye.
you wouldn't believe all the products in here.
Kevin would freak.
I feel so bad about that woman.
well, did you offer to pay the dry cleaning bill?
you know, she refused to take any money from me, and then I got so upset, she somehow made me feel better.
Oh, god. That sounds like something my mother would do.
well, anyway, wine's better.
mm, yes, it is.
so what are you gonna be when you grow up?
well, I'm a writer.
or, you know, I'm I'm trying to be.
I haven't been, uh, published or Oh, well, please, that's okay.
you know, ulysses s. Grant, he was a total loser.
complete failure most of his life.
I've learned a lot about presidents today.
well, you should take my class.
you'd probably learn a lot more.
I could, you know?
I am a grad student in the lit department.
you're kidding?
no. You know, it makes sense, right?
uh, coffee shop's two blocks from campus.
no. No. Oh, my god, no. No, no, no.
this-this doesn't make sense at-at all.
this is-this is- I- I-I teach there.
well, you said you were a guest lecturer.
still.
It...It-it-it's unethical.
it is not unethical.
well, okay, then it's not the kind of example that I want to set, okay?
why didn't you tell me this before?
well...
you didn't ask, you know?
and-and I don't know.
I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
that's actually where you're wrong, because it's a very big deal.
see, remember I told you that I had to go see the young wexley republicans?
now how do you think they're gonna feel when they find out that I've been hooking up with a graduate student?
you know, I ran for senate, so I have a certain reputation that I have to live up to, and, um, - I - you wanted to have a little fun, and now it's over.
I get it.
I'm sorry. You know, you don't have to make me feel bad.
no, no. - I feel bad.
look, hey, don't, all right?
don't feel bad, you know?
I mean, look, contrary to what you might think, we're both adults.
I knew what I was getting into.
I'm, I'll, uh...
I'll go. I'll go.
I'm-oh, man. I'm sorry.
this is just...
well, maybe not the most attractive thing on earth, but it's dry, and what the hell?
you look beautiful.
did I hear the phone ring?
who called?
Yeah, yeah, it was, uh, it was-it was housekeeping.
you know, there is, um...
there is another robe in there for you, too.
and I'm feeling just a little bit weird being the only person in the room not wearing any clothes, so...
why don't you take your clothes off, too?
well, I-in a minute. In a minute.
well...
I could always spill some icy cold beverage on you.
no, thanks.
um, look, can we just, uh, have a seat here and, uh, drink some of this icy cold champagne?
well, this is awkward. - Well, I would understand if you're having second thoughts.
well, I'm-i'm not having second thoughts.
are you having second thoughts?
Oh, my god. You're having second thoughts?
no, I-I just want to make sure that we know what we're getting ourselves into. That's all.
we're in a hotel room, karl.
I'm naked here.
how could we not know what we're getting ourselves in for?
please don't get upset.
well, I am upset. I am upset.
my god.
what is your problem?
you invite me here to this hotel and then you change your mind?
I'm in a friggin' bathrobe here for god sake.
I just-can we just talk this out, please? - I am upset. We can't talk it out.
I'm not one of your patients.
just go, okay?
Nora, I'm - Good-bye, karl.
I'm so-i'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I never-never intended - You never intended?
to what?
to sleep with me?
no, no. No, I did.
Yes, yes, yes.
but it's...
I ran into your daughter - My daughter?
Sarah, in the lobby. - She's here?
don't worry. I didn't tell her that I was meeting you.
I didn't. It's just Nora...
your family is so important to you, and there are just so many of them, and-and I worry, if we-we take this to the next level
so my family is too much for you?
once we do something like this - Like what, have sex?
yeah - My god, karl.
you are making such a big deal out of this.
people have been having sex for thousands of years.
Yes, I know that.
but there are just lot more feelings at stake here, and it is a big deal, - I mean, which is why we have to be honest about everything - well, I am honest.
I have been honest.
I am not so sure about you.
I--- where are you going?
anywhere else but here.
Oh, karl.
just a sec.
I hope you're alone.
mom. W-how did you - Oh, god. This is awful.
Oh, no.
did you follow him here?
well, it wasn't my idea to come here.
that's for damn sure.
wait. Why are you wearing a robe?
because it's more embarrassing like this.
Oh, no.
Karl was meeting you here?
Oh, I thought...
what?
th-the only reason I called the room was - You called the room?
Sarah, what did you say?
Oh, god. You told him I was in love with him, didn't you?
no, no. I just said that you liked him a lot.
and then I physically threatened him, I think.
Oh, Sarah. - I'm sorry, mom.
I think I really messed it up. Oh, god.
I can't believe...
Kitty, I-I can't, um, I can't talk right now.
what?
no, just That's where I am The hotel velone.
Kitty's here, too?
I'm feel-mom?
we're all here.
Oh, god.
I should just jump. What floor are we on?
uh, eight.
that ought to do it.
okay, okay. Thanks, hon.
so the boys are happy in Kitty's room.
hopefully, they will stay there.
thank you for getting rid of them.
the last thing on earth I wanted to look at right now is Kevin stoned out of his gourd.
there's a little bit more cabernet. Who wants it?
me.
give it to her.
she gets whatever she wants tonight.
well, at least I learned, karl is not interested in me sooner rather than later.
well, he got you down to your robe.
no, the pizza boy did that.
pardon me?
it's a long story, honey.
and it's fine.
no, mom. It-it's not. I meddled. I shouldn't have. He told me not to.
I messed everything up for you.
I completely obliterated your brand-new relationship.
I'm so sorry.
I'm not mad at you, honey. I'm-i'm mad at karl.
well, I'm mad at me.
our night is ruined.
all I wanted was this one perfect night, just the two of us, before you went away.
and now you're leaving.
in 12 hours, you're gonna be on a plane to china for 2 months. Oh, my god.
and I don't want you to go.
I mean, of course I want you to go.
it's an amazing opportunity.
well, honey, he'll be back.
I know that, mom.
Oh, okay.
I just wish we had more time.
I got a text...
from karl.
what? What does he say?
wanna talk?
meet me downstairs in the...
he can't even complete a text.
all right.
in the bar.
are you gonna go?
no, of course not.
at least he's out of the room, and I can go put some clothes on.
okay, mom. Bye.
wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
as the only man here, can I just say something?
men can be heartless, I know.
but most of us, we just act like fools.
the better ones admit it.
I think you should hear him out.
God, I love pizza.
me gusta pizza, tambien.
don't do that!
I'm kidding. I'm sorry. I just... - That's not funny.
how the hell did this happen to you?
it was an accident.
well, it wouldn't have happened if you weren't stuffing food down your throat this morning.
I was nervous.
Kevin, there's nothing to be nervous about.
Kevin, the state of california is not going to turn you down.
do you know how many needy kids there are - Well, maybe that's why i'm freaking out, because this is finally going to happen.
Oh, my god. I can't win with you.
you're nervous we won't get a kid. You're nervous we will get a kid.
I'm a nervous guy, okay?
okay. - Okay, okay.
could we order more pizza?
Oh, I didn't even order it, actually.
Seth went out to get more...Pizza.
why'd you send him home anyway?
he neglected to tell me that he's a student at wexley.
Oh, are you dating one of your students?
no. - It's not illegal to date a student so long as he's not your student.
I'm a republican. I'm a conservative.
and according to dean whitley, i'm a living testament to family values.
you know what I think?
so stop worrying about whether conservative women should sleep with 20 year olds...
or what the dean of family values thinks of you.
live.
I think i'm finally sober.
I got your text.
Yeah, well, desperate times call for desperate messaging.
can I get you a drink?
no, thank you.
but I will sit down, though.
I had a glass of wine upstairs A lovely cabernet.
right. With, uh, Sarah.
and Kevin and Scotty and Kitty.
they're all here?
Yes. And I know, there are so many of them.
I'm sorry. I...I behaved horribly, which wouldn't be the first time.
my...my ex-wife, hated cabernet.
she always complained it was too jammy.
well, I didn't know you'd been married before.
Yeah, it lasted, uh, 18 months.
what happened?
well, I didn't want any children.
what, you mean you didn't have that conversation before you decided to walk down the aisle?
you you'd think, but no, not really.
you, you see, I I have a difficult time expressing my feelings, so...
perhaps you should seek professional help.
I do. I do. I did. I just got off the phone with my shrink.
you're in therapy?
Yeah, same guy that I saw when I lived in chicago.
we do a phoner once a week.
Really? That's interesting.
and what offhand would you say is your problem?
well...
I don't exactly have a great track record when it comes to intimacy.
so when I heard that you...
like me...
Oh, god. Oh, god.
so what did Sarah told you what, I was falling for you?
pretty much.
Yeah, yeah, when she when she said that, you know, all my old tapes started playing, and-and I-and I panicked
no kidding.
uh, but what I What I wanted to tell you- I mean, the reason that I texted you...
what scared me, I think, is...
I...I might be falling for you, too.
what, did your shrink help you realize that?
well, that and that I was an idiot for suggesting a hotel.
well, it was half off.
you know, I...
I never expected to meet such an amazing woman.
I mean, especially at this point in my life, with all my little - oh, just stop.
no more words.
don't talk.
look...
you know where I live.
I make a hell of a roast chicken.
if you'd like to come over for dinner sometime, just the two of us, we could just...
see how it goes.
text me.
you know, I don't know about you, but, uh, I'm starving.
tonight?
I love roast chicken.
okay, hey. Hi. Good morning, everybody.
this is a class about politics.
what is it? i...
that's a very good question.
politics is about changing the world, one day at a time.
it's the social worker.
hello. yes. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
is it-is it serious?
Oh, of cour-yeah. No problem. bye.
what?
social worker has to reschedule.
apparently her kid's really sick.
after all that buildup?
guess I should go back to work.
wait. You know...
we haven't had much time lately for just us.
that's true.
and it hasn't been the easiest couple of months.
no. - Right.
so why don't you and I check into a hotel room?
no, not - no, it could be like a little second honeymoon.
we'd have to put some serious distance between us and your family.
is nepal far enough?
no.
but vegas might be.
I could call my sous chef and she could cover for me.
if we leave now...
we could be hours away before they even know we're gone. - Call her.
Really?
Yeah. Let's go.
okay. I have a great idea of what we're gonna do.
what time is it?
it's time for me to go.
Oh, god, no. I fell asleep. I'm sorry.
you don't have to apologize.
last night was actually - A disaster.
I was going to say unforgettable.
well, it wasn't the happy ending I was hoping for.
I completely underestimated how much Scotty and Kevin love old movies.
actually, that was my fault.
I love humphrey bogart.
I'm gonna miss you.
look, we'll get through this.
I'm gonna call you every night.
I'm gonna e-mail, skype, sex-text you.
I'm gonna paint as fast as I can.
I love you.
there's so much in this world ?
the taxi will be here in 20 minutes.
we'd have to be fast. - I can do fast.
I don't remember ordering room service.
well...
you didn't have to.
Oh, this is nice.
fresh berries and your coffee.
well, you have a grand hotel here.
we make the magic and we make the beds.
Wh-I didn't, uh, expect to see you again.
well, like you said, you're only a couple of blocks from campus, so I...
so, uh, how were those, uh, those young wexley republicans?
I hear they can be awfully judgmental.
Oh, they're fine.
they're fine.
my, my problem is-is- Is that I...
I like you.
and I was wondering what you think I should do about that.
so, uh, wow, you're You're, uh, asking me?
no. No. No.
uh, if that's your phone number, I've already got it,'cause you called me, so it's in my phone, you know?
Oh, no, I know. I know. I'm just, um...
giving it to you again.
you're gonna buy all my interest in Ojai foods. -We can't, Holly and I are gonna take the proceeds from the sale of the stock and buy Greendale winery.
I'm not supposed to have sex yet.
they think I'll just replace my drug addiction- -oh, and what, after rehab you're sworn to celibacy?
Yeah, kinda.
I gotta go.
you're looking for something. I'm not enough for you.
am I enough for you?
are you running for president? -Well, yes, I am, Miss walker.
dad had another kid, with Holly.
does mom know about this? -No. And, Kevin, she never will.
you told your sister about us? -St that we're friends. It's--It's fine.
don't worry. We gotta be careful.
the prodigal daughter returns.
I thought it would be a nice surprise. -Oh, my god.
do you know what this- -the editorial is about?
that one of the reasons that governor Whitmore's candidacies a stretch is because his daughter is too fat to be first daughter.
she's 13.
you're right. That's awful.
Yeah. I mean, my children are going through a divorce.
they need time.
they don't need to be judged by the national media or anyone.
and not to mention... -no. No, no. No way.
I'm not gonna be a factor in that decision.
well, you know that there's no way for us to have a normal relationship.
you can forget about it, right?
okay.
there is a personal cost when you run for president.
but as far as we're concerned, there's no reason why you and I can't be a normal couple.
how?
well, uh, for starters, could try and sleep in a little bit.
is that what normal couples do?
what about this?
uh, yeah.
Yeah, that's normal.
that cannot be a good thing. -No, no. It's--it's gearing up.
just give it a few minutes.
come on, Holly.
listen to that. It sounds like it's in its final death throes.
No! No, that's impossible. It's brand-new.
Oh. my condolences.
may be we better read the manual. -Okay.
um, how's your Italian? - Very good.
l. A. Sucks.
I spent one hour on the 110, and I missed breakfast with...
Caitlin.
sorry. I didn't realize you had a guest. No, it's fine.
saul, this is my daughter Rebecca. Saul and I work together at Ojai.
Oh. Yeah, it's so nice to meet you, Rebecca. Your moth never said that you were so lovely.
Oh, I guess mom doesn't talk about me much, 'cause I doubt she'd use the word "lovely."
Becca, that was a compliment. Say thank you.
thank you. -You're welcome.
is there any cereal left? -Uh, yeah. Try the top shelf.
well, I didn't realize it was getting to be so late.
it was very nice to meet you, Rebecca. Bye.
we'll talk more at the office.
soory about, um...interrupting the midmorning booty call.
maybe you should put a sock on the door or something.
saul was just helping me with the coffee machine.
Oh, is that what the senior set is calling it these days?
Yes, we are seeing each other, if that's what you mean.
well, at least that embarrassing little run-in clarified some things...
the sudden windfall, the winery, the Maserati, the crazy-expensive housewares.
saul has nothing to do with any of that. -Right.
Becca, I told you the truth. A close friend died and left me some money.
this is a good thing, becca.
I mean, you can go back to college if you want. You can take classes--writing, photography.
you can travel if you want.
the point is, we have options.
why can't you be happy?
I would be happy if we had coffee.
okay.
no, we swore for the sake of our sisterhood that we would never, ever, ever ask each other to double-date again ever.
Oh, come on, Sarah. We were 19 years old. That is ancient history, and...
besides, I already told Robert that you would come.
Oh, it's "Robert" now?
well, I have seen the birthmark on his butt, so we're on a first-name basis.
would you just come on? It'll be fun.
one thing Joe and I are not at the moment is fun.
I'd say we're downright gloomy.
well, shake it up. Get out.
Yeah, right, um...intensive couples counseling didn't work, but a good dinner out, that'll fix everything.
look, Sarah, I know that you and Joe have been having a hard time, but if I honestly believed that staying home was gonna help, then I would just drop it.
Sarah, there's a problem. -Okay, listen, fine. But if it's a complete disaster, don't say I didn't tell you.
what's the problem?
it's your sister.
I just got off the phone with her.
not Kitty.
Sarah, what do you mean you knew?
what? I ran into her at Holly's house the other day.
and you didn't think that was worth mentioning?
I didn't think any of you wanted to hear it. No.
well, you're right about that.
well, what was she like?
I don't know. She...she seemed fine.
well, how long is she staying? I mean, if this is just a visit, I'd say we drop it.
it's not just a visit. Apparently, she's dropped out of college and was living with a friend in Chicago.
and when that didn't work out, she moved back home indefinitely.
sounds like Holly raised a real winner.
despite your opinion of Holly or Rebecca, the question remains, what are we going to do?
nothing.
absolutely nothing. Not with everything that's been going on here.
and what's that supposed to mean?
what I mean, Tommy, is do you really think this business with Holly can go on if mom finds out about Rebecca?
Ugh, this is exactly why I didn't want to say anything.
excuse me, Holly is in our lives now. She is working here. What if Nora runs into Rebecca?
what if your mother asks questions?
I say we tell her.
I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, Saul.
mom finding out now will destroy her.
besides, you're in a relationship with Holly. How long do you think that can last if this whole thing blows up?
we all have thing sat stake, Sarah.
at least if it's out in the open, we have a chance to diffuse it.
SaulÂ·Rebecca's lived in this city most of her life. It hasn't affected any of us.
Justin and Kitty don't even know she exists.
that's another thing. I mean, Justin's just out of rehab.
are we really gonna throw this at him? -Right.
if your mother found out that we were keeping this from her.
we've been keeping it from her for--for months.
that was before Rebecca moved back home.
our chances of keeping this a secret from her are
saul, nobody will find out if we don't tell them.
now Holly's lied to Rebecca her whole life.
I don't think she's going to risk telling her now.
come on.
haven't we learned anything this year?
Tommy, you're with us, right?
Yeah. -Good.
apparently, you've all made up your minds.
it's settled then.
he had this one long hair. His, like, Fu Manchu thing.
he had this little fuzz on his upper lip.
he was so proud of it-you're kidding.
and he called it a mustache? -Yeah.
it was a mustache.
it was a mustache.
mom, is there anything else you want to bring up?
how about my acne or that-- that piano tie wore to the senior prom?
Oh, my god.
you were the guying the piano tie.
I can't believe this is happening. Mom, you're killing me.
Oh, don't be ridiculous. I--I'm going to make you a bagel.
if it'll stop the humiliating trip down memory lane, please.
look, I thought we were being discreet. You're not dressed.
I'm not naked.
what are you two whispering about down there?
I was just offering, uh, Tyler ride to work today.
Justin, come on, now.
you don't need to feel uncomfortable. Really, Tyler is welcome to stay over any time she likes.
I mean, you two are old enough to do whatever you want.
just stay safe. -We are.
all right, just--here you go. Eat up. -Thank you.
I'm going...
please.
going get ready for my day. Bye. -Bye.
wow, you must've really won her over. I mean, she does not dig up those embarrassing stories for just anyone.
well, you can get en tonight.
my parents will be more than happy to fill you in on all the gory details of my adolescence.
okay, they're meeting their only daughter's recovering-addict boyfriend.
somehow senior doesn't strike me as the dinner topic of choice.
Justin, they're not like that.
they're going to love you. -I hope so.
check out this web site.
the skinny Minnie.
wow, do people really read this? -Yep.
everything you always wanted and not wanted to know about your celebrities.
scroll down past the photo of Britney without underwear.
Oh, it's you...
and me!
soap hunk shops for furniture in WhEo with friend.
wow, I'm a friend? -You're a friend in italics.
and if that didn't sound the alarm, check out the less-than-hetero lamp he took home.
I told you that lamp was gay and ugly.
it gets worse.
it could just be wishful thinking, but we're getting a serious gay vibe from the daytime doctor.
Kev, I've spent the morning fielding calls from my agent, my manager, my mom.
your mom checks skinny Minnie?
she goggles my name once a week.
and that's not the point.
we need to lay low.
what? Chad, we barely go out in daylight as it is.
come on, I'm starting to feel like a vampire.
besides, we didn't do anything wrong.
I know. But, Kev, I'm in this guy's sights.
look, there are better options than laying low. Believe me. We can call...
Dan silk, threaten him.
no offense, but I don't think you could take him.
not to mention pummeling this guy wouldn't do much for my public image.
I mean, we could threaten him with legal action.
but it's true.
I'm a lawyer. Truth is irrelevant. Look, I do this all the time.
I just need to make it clear, if he doesn't print a retraction, he's going to face a very lengthy, very expensive lawsuit.
I'll bury him in discovery and depositions. Its lawyering 101.
I've never seen you so...
litigious. -Right.
it's kind of hot.
but no way can you call him.
Oh, why--look, he's not some major corporation.
he's one guy. He's one loser. He'll cave. They all do.
believe me. -No.
we just need to let it blow over.
these stories don't have long shelf life.
if we don't give him any more ammunition, this silk dude will move onto somebody else.
and then- -and then what, daylight again?
definitely. -Good.
and I could totally take that guy.
you just worry too much, Nora. You always have.
look, I know Sarah and Joe are going through a rough it, but are you sure that's all?
I really think Tommy's decision to buy this winery with Holly is bothering her more TN she's letting on.
look, Tommy and Sarah have a very strong bond.
and William never would have brought Sarah to Ojai foods if he thought that she and tommy couldn't survive little sibling rivalry.
you're right. You're right.
I mean, look at us. -What do you mean?
our family wasn't exactly a picnic, and yet, here we are after all these years, still speaking to one another.
you want a green bean? -Yes, thank you.
it's a small miracle, isn't it? -Yes, it is.
I don't know...
I think maybe was wrong about her.
about who? -Holly.
what do you mean?
you're seeing her, Tommy is starting a company with her.
as much as I hate to admit it...
maybe William was a good judge of character.
well, I mean, your instincts are admirable, but you don't have to put aside your feelings for the sake of any of us, Nora.
I'm not saying I want to be the woman's best friend.
I'm just saying...
I have been so busy blaming her, I don't think I've ever really seen her for who she is.
okay. So what are you proposing?
the truth of the matter is, Holly Isa part of our family now.
I think I should embrace that, if only to set an example.
I mean, we all have to put the past behind us where it belongs and move on.
you think I'm crazy?
no, Nora, I don't think you're crazy.
good, 'cause if there's one person I count onto be my reality check, it's you.
what?
it's the past. It's--it--it's not behind us.
you have to tell me. What?
tell me.
william and Holly had a daughter.
what?
her name is Rebecca. She's 20 years old.
she's here in L. Aim so sorry, Nora.
I'm so sorry.
no one wanted to upset you.
no one?
who else knows?
who else knows?
Sarah and Tommy and Kevin.
but you have to understand- -what about Justin and Kitty?
they don't know.
Oh, god. -Look, Nora, I didn't want this to be like the affair.
I didn't want it to fester under the surface, haunting us.
come on, Nora. -Oh, my god.
Where--where are you going? What are you doing?
I have to find Kitty and Justin. -Please, wait. Talk to me. Wait, please.
no. There will be no more lies, Saul.
no more. I won't stand for it.
Nora, wait.
are you sure?
I mean, how do we know that Holly's even telling the truth?
as much as I'd like to, I don't think we can ignore the obvious.
what are we supposed to say? "Oh, wow, we have a sister now"?
Justin, you don't have to say or do anything you don't want to.
this is just going to take time for us all.
so--so what? Dad made Holly a beneficiary of the land because of Rebecca?
I don't know, but I suspect its part of it.
did he know that he was her father?
I don't know what he knew.
this is crazy.
you're saying dad hid one of his kids from us for years, and then gave Holly the land, so--so his affairs thrown in our face because of some girl named Rebecca?
Justin, I wish I could tell you what your father was thinking.
i--it's a shock. It's a shock for me, too.
I don't know why. He lied to you about having a mistress.
Oh, Justin, that's not fair.
no, seriously, I mean, why should I be so shocked that he lied to us, too?
I mean, this whole--this whole family revolves around lying.
Justin, please.
grandma! Aunt Kitty!
Hi, honey. -Hi, grandma.
Hi. -Hi.
Hey, guys. -Hey, sweetie poo.
Hi, rascal. -Hey, guys.
wonderful.
Hey, Nora. -Hi.
Hey, Kitty.
I can hardly pick you up.
please help me understand how you could discovery our father has another child and not tell me.
we trying to spare you the pain.
how, by keeping me in the dark?
God, you should've seen Justin's reaction.
Oh, that's why Saul shouldn't have said anything.
no, you do not get to blame Saul for this.
at least he had enough faith in me, enough respect for me, to be honest, which is more than I can say for you or Tommy or Kevin.
What...were you just never going to tell me? Is that it?
mom, you've had so much to cope with. Just didn't seem to bathe right time.
Oh, I can just see Tommy spear heading this whole brilliant idea. He's so like his father.
no, it was my idea.
it was your idea?
Yeah, I was the one who thought that we should keep this information from you.
your father made you president of our family business, Sarah, not our family.
and you taught me to always put this family first... and that's what I was trying to do.
no, it is not. You were trying to do what was easy for you.
you think this has been easy, keeping this a secret?
no one asked you to.
there is no justification for this.
Oh, god. What?!
Hey.
you ready for dinner?
may I speak to Dan silk? -You're talking to him.
my name is Kevin Walker, and F.Y.I.
if you're going to make a living tarnishing people's reputations, you may want an unlisted number.
thanks for the tip.
do I know you?
no, you do not, although you did print my picture without my permission on your little libelous web site.
I'm the friend of Chad Barry.
Oh, you're that dude. -Yeah, I'm that dude.
Hey, I'm just looking for the dish on Barry, so, uh, if you want to spill, I'm sure I could...
no, no, no, no. You misunderstand. I'm an attorney.
and on behalf of Mr. Barry,
I demand that you cease and desist publishing all uncorroborated information about his personal life.
Hey, man, what can I say?
inquiring minds want to know.
Mr. Barry's contemplating filing a complaint.
the cause of action--invasion of ivory, libel, unfair business practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress.
should I go on?
but you're not denying Barry's gay?
okay, listen to me, son, and I'll say this in a way that you understand.
if you don't stop targeting my client, I will bury you so deep in litigation, it'll be your great-great-grandchildren paying off the legal bills.
do I make myself clear?
Yeah, I get it.
you made your point. -Good. Then thank you so much for your time.
Hey, mom.
what's wrong?
Kevin? What are you doing please, please, tell me exactly what you were thinking.
because I'm sure, I'm quite sure, we all agreed we would not say a thing.
you agreed, Saul! -Kevin, Kevin, I didn't want it to happen the way it did.
I'm sorry, do you even--do you even get what you've done?
Mom--mom is furious.
Kitty and Justin are reeling. I mean, Sarah is mortified, as am I, as is tommy.
did you stop and think for a split second how bad this makes us look?
well, frankly, I wasn't thinking about you. -You weren't thinking of anyone, Saul!
I was thinking about your mother.
you had no right, absolutely no right, to do this without consulting us.
I have every right.
she's my sister.
and you tell me that you wouldn't do the same thing if it were Kitty or Sarah.
I wouldn't single-handedly sell out the rest of my family, no.
you weren't there, Kevin.
she was sitting in front of me, opening up her heart to Holly, berating herself for misjudging her, and she expected met tell her that she was doing the right thing.
and I will be dammed I will let her make herself vulnerable in that way only to have her world come crashing down again.
you better hope this family finds a way to repair itself, because if this does any lasting damage, I'm holding you responsible.
you know, I learned something interesting today.
you know the San Francisco cable cars are a only moving national monument.
didn't know that.
you know, I have told you every time that I sleep with somebody I work with, and you can't tell me that we have a sister?
a half-sister, and for the 400th time, Kitty, I am sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
well--I thought you gals were going to table this discussion.
Yeah, so did I! -We are.
what's happening in D. C?
well, I'm working on legislation now that, if we pass it, would dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
it'd be like taking 100 million cars right off the street.
it'd be pretty groundbreaking.
that's impressive. -Yeah.
you know, the other thing- -and for the record...
Oh, brother.
I don't see why I should be the one to take the fall for this. I wasn't the only one that knew.
okay, well, you're bearing the brunt of this because you happen to be here.
okay, believe me, I wish that Tommy and Kevin were here, too.
is it always like this? -Yeah.
anyway, I don't even know why you're upset. You always dreamed of having a little baby sister.
Sarah, you know what? I was 6, okay?
and that little wish didn't include dad cheating on mom.
I didn't know what to do, Kitty, so I thought the best thing to do was nothing, so shoot me.
Oh.
do you like cigars? 'Cause I got some good ones, and we could...
that'd be great.
you didn't know what to do, so you did nothing.
Oh, what would you have done, Kitty?
what would you have done? Oh, yeah, just -I would have told you, Sarah.
Justin, where are you? You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
look, I can't make it. I'm sorry.
what are you talking about? My mom's been cooking all day.
look, I'm sorry, okay. It's something with my family, and I can't talk about it now.
look, I got to go. I'll call you tomorrow.
I'm glad you called, man.
it's been a while. -Thanks for coming.
it's bad enough my dad was in love with another woman, like my mom wasn't enough, but, I mean, another kid?
I guess you weren't enough either, huh?
this whole thingies textbook you.
look, I know you, Justin.
you didn't become an army medic for nothing. You can't stand to see people in pain.
and right now you and your family are suffering.
there's nothing you can do to make that go away.
and if it gets overwhelming, you know the drill-- find a meeting, work the steps.
you know, I still don't get it, though. I mean, how could he lie to us about his own daughter like that, knowing what it would do to us when found out?
and her.
Rebecca, right?
you know, I didn't even think about her.
God, what if...
I wonder if she even knows.
not exactly a "normal couple "night out, huh?
Oh, I think it was surprisingly normal, considering how blindsided you were. You want something to drink?
Oh...yes, please.
I think I have to just stand not move.
because if I do, who knows what else is going to come along and rip my life apart?
you're right.
let's not move.
it's too big a risk.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
why do anything?
well, eventually, I'm going to have to get up.
I don't know, the thing is, is that everybody keeps telling me that I have this sister, and I don't know what the hell that means.
I mean, when I think of Sarah, I don't think of her D. N.A.
I think about how we grew up together in the same house with the same weird family.
and how we, you know, shared our diaries and our shampoo.
but what, am I supposed to have those same feelings for a woman never even met?
Oh, I don't think anybody expects that.
Oh, well, and then there's... my dad.
I don't know, the thing is, is that everybody keeps telling me that I have this sister, and I don't know what the hell that means.
and I was just starting to get all happy.
I wouldn't let this destroy that.
you hold on to what's good, what makes you happy.
you make me happy.
I do? -Yeah.
would it be okay with you if we...
still just sit here for a while?
as long as you want.
kids wake you up?
no.
I, uh, I just couldn't sleep.
you want to talk? -No.
it's all right, Joe. You don't have to stay up.
you'll get through this.
everyone's so mad at me--mom...
Kitty, Uncle Saul.
and, um...
I don't have you.
you know?
I'm right here.
Hey, mom. -Justin.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
are you all right? -I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just exhausted.
okay. -Hey.
I told Tyler it would be all right if she waited here.
okay. Yeah.
I'll give you guys some privacy. I'll be upstairs if you need me.
all right. I love you. -I love you. I'm okay.
I love you, too. -I'm okay.
okay. Okay.
your mom told me what happened. I'm sorry.
sorry about missing dinner.
Oh, it's okay.
I was just worried. Um, the last time you sounded like that...
I was with my sponsor.
Oh. That's good.
look, I get it if you're angry at me. -I'm not angry.
I just don't know if I can handle it.
I guess that's why they tell you not to date anyone your first year you're clean.
I never understood that before tonight, because I couldn't deal with anyone or anything...
but me.
that's how it should be.
look, you weren't wrong to worry, okay?
I just don't think I'm ready for a relationship, Tyler.
I know. I know.
I just want you to be okay.
more than anything want for us...
I want that for you.
come here.
it's okay.
have you talked to mom?
I keep trying to reach her, but she's not picking up, at least not for me.
Yeah, not for me either.
let me be the onto kick holly out of our lives once and for all.
Holly's not going anywhere, nor do I want her to.
I-I hope you don't think what happened last night changes anything.
it changes everything. Tommy, you aren't still be planning to go into business with that woman.
I am.
she won't be satisfied until she has destroyed everything we've created here.
don't be fooled, Tommy. This whole nightmare is because of her.
Sarah, there is enough blame to go around.
is that a dig at me?
we lied, dad lied.
in fact, right now Holly's probably the most honest one of us all.
you can't be that naive.
look, I already told you, I didn't start this winery for you or mom.
all right? I did this for me, building something for myself.
that was before the horror show landed on my lap.
look, it landed in our laps.
you want to control everything. God, you just--you thrive off of control.
but this is out of your hands.
spare me, Tommy. Okay?
I already pay for therapy. I really don't need your amateur psychoanalysis.
just let it go.
okay. Well, clearly I'm the only one who still gives a dam about Ojai, so...you'll understand that I have work to do.
excuse me. I'm looking for holly harper. She's not in her office.
I don't know where she...
do I know you?
no, I don't think so. I'm her daughter Rebecca.
right.
I thought you'd look more like your mom.
I'm Sarah...Walker.
it's nice to meet you.
you, too.
So...Holly?
Oh, um, I have no idea where she is.
okay. Thanks. Sorry.
um, do you have a minute? Could I...talk to you?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, beck. Where you been?
I stopped by Ojai today.
I wanted to check out your new digs.
you did? -Yeah, I got the address from some papers you had lying around.
I thought I'd surprise you.
well, I'm sorry that I... I missed you.
I was out meeting with a distributor, and I-I didn't want to drive all the way back to the office.
so, um, would you like met make lunch for both of us?
no. I don't really have an appetite right now.
I met some people there, at Ojai...
like Sarah.
mom, do you remember that Christmas when I was 8and I had my tonsils taken out?
and then after the surgery, your friend bill came byte visit, and he gave me that doll with the long red hair.
did bill really think that a doll could make up for abandoning me?
what was it, like a "sorry for being deadbeat dad" gift?
please... let me explain.
Oh, there's an explanation for why you lied to me for 20 yrs.?
you said that bill was just your friend and just kind of left out that part about him beg your boyfriend for, like, two decades, and my father?
honey, oh, god, it is--it is complicated. -It seems pretty simpleton me, mom.
you were willing to be sloppy seconds for some rich jerk with a wife and kids.
and my dad didn't want to fess up to having a bastard child with his mistress 'cause he didn't want to risk his Norman Rockwell life. Do I have it straight, mom?
no, I know that you're angry, but you need to hear me though.
Why? It's too late to do anything about it. He's dead.
Yes...but--but you- -how much of it is mine?
Wh-What?
the money that William walker left you, how much of it is mine?
I-I put $2 million in a trust in your name, and it will be yours when you're 25.
well, I guess that's better than some stupid doll.
Hey. Dude, I am so screwed.
I'm so glad it's you and not my mom, or my brothers or my sister, or indeed my half-sister.
could my life get any more complicated?
what's up? -Did you even hear what I said?
a countdown clock--dean silk is counting out the day still I come out on his fragging' web site.
Chad Barry, come out, come out, wherever you are. That son of a bitch.
what I can't figure out is why is guy gunning for me?
Oh, no. You called him.
no, I-- Yes. Yes, I did. I thought I...I thought I could convince him to leave you alone.
you think you're the first lawyer ever and try and scare this as swipe?
he makes his living from screwing with people's personalizes. You just egged him on.
you promised you wouldn't do anything.
I'm sorry, Chad. I come from long line of people who are incapable of leaving well enough alone.
if you had any respect for how important my career is to me, you would've listened and not gone behind my back.
you're right.
you're absolutely right. -Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
so. Where do we go from here?
I'll tell you where we won't go out to the movies, out to dinner, shopping, hiking, the gym...
I'm all for cutting out the gym.
no, the shipment was for 1, 400, not 14.
look, just deal with it. Okay?
do you have any idea...?
what you have done to my friend to Rebecca's?
what I've done, are you serious? -My god.
as a mother, how--how could you be that cruel?
my daughter is crushed.
her whole identity, everything that we had--our--our relationship
has been--been decimated, and all for what, out of spite?
so--so that you could get even with me?
but I just told her the truth.
I was planning on telling her everything, on my timetable, in my way.
it was not your place.
my place? Oh, you are unbelievable.
it wasn't your place to have an affair with a married man.
it wasn't your place to have my father's child.
it certainly wasn't your place to come crawling out of the woodwork and demand a piece of our family business, but none of that stopped you, did it?
you' done nothing but cause my family pain.
so if you're perfect little world has come crashing down around you because the truth has finally come out, you know what? Join the damn club.
I let you treat me like dirt because I love and respected your father.
but I am done treating you with any measure of civility.
is that a threat?
you bet your asset's a threat.
and you... I trusted you.
Holly, I had to do what was best for my family.
don't you ever call me again?
I'm sorry you feel that way.
not sorry enough.
what you reading?
seeing with serenity: How to cope with what life deals you.
I took a trip to the self-help section at the bookstore.
so far it's just pages and pages of vague platitudes.
mom, you've been avoiding my calls.
I didn't know what I wanted to say.
look, I wish I could turn back the clock and make a different decision, mom, but I can't.
I know. -You seem angrier at methane Kevin or Tommy. Am I wrong?
probably not.
you hold met a different standard than anyone else.
that's not fair.
Yes.
you're right. It's not fair.
I just always felt this connection with you.
I mean, you raise a boy, and you don't expect them to tell you anything.
you're lucky if they acknowledge you on their way out the door.
but you... always confided in me.
I felt like you trusted met handle whatever came along.
I never had that relationship with my mother. I always thought had it with you.
mom, we do have that relationship. The last thing in the world wanted to do was hurt you.
I know.
but that doesn't mean you didn't.
I...get the feeling you're not here to see me.
no, I'm not.
is Rebecca here?
Rebecca, this is Justin, Justin walker.
so you're one of them, his family?
Yeah.
I got it, mom. -Okay.
if you're expecting tears from me, you can forget it.
I'm not expecting anything.
I just wanted to meet you.
well, I'm here. I'm real. You can even touch me.
uh, you--you want to walk? -Okay.
it's so bizarre. We live, like, 15 minutes away. In L. A.
that's practically being neighbors.
Where'd you go to school?
I started at la salle.
swanky.
well, I got kicked out junior year, and then I finished up at, uh, San Marino.
what about you? -Marshall. I think we played you in football.
uh, didn't play football. -Oh, that's good. I hate it.
uh, marshal? Uh, did you know a Carter Aspen?
Oh, god. Totally.
he used to date this girl Rebecca. -Yeah, that was me. ...
okay, I 'officially freaked out now.
I mean, what if we had met?
what if we--oh...
Oh, the Greek tragedy of it all.
So...What do you do?
presently, not much.
I'm a--I'm a vet. I was in Afghanistan.
afghanistan.
that must've been intense. -Uh, yeah, it was.
so... you and Carter... I can't believe that.
a billion people eat this food every day.
don't you think it would taste a lot better coming from your orchards?
of course, but you're not gonna charm me into a deal.
I'm having a big family dinner. Why don't you join us?
that sounds great.
mom's really into this guy isaac.
but if she wants us to go over to the house and have dinner, that's what we have to do.
Tommy had an affair with lena.
I never liked that girl.
if you're gonna blame anyone, blame tommy.
your opinion doesn't count because you sleptwith lena, too.
I'm still sleeping with her.
it's not just that you slept with lena.
did it, too. I slept with someone. - You what?
we went out in high school. It was a mistake.
was she? Was lena a mistake?
Yeah, she was.
Scotty, jason is coming back.
HE--HE--HE contacted me.
Hey, mom.
good sweet god in heaven, was that you?
no, that would betyphoid travis, attempting to spread his plague to the good people of iowa.
those good people gave me this plague.
so...
is isaac sick, too?
no, Travis would be the only one suffering at the moment, thank god.
don't drink so much!
I don't. I hardly drink at all.
I thought maybe if he was sick, that's why he hadn't called.
and then who could blame him, you know, after the dinner party from hell.
no, mom, he's just busy with the california primary, that's all.
you don't have to make excuses. I can take rejection.
mom, I'm not making excuses.
i-it turns out that presidential campaignsare kind oftime-consuming, okay?
you know what you should do?
go down to the office, and youshould ask him out for lunch.
God, no.
that is justway too forward. - Mom, you know what?
the man watched our family disintegrate over paella.
I think you're pastthe too-forward stage.
and whatever happened with julia and tommy anyway?
I don't know.
I never talk to them anymore.
I don't even talk to justin, who I guess is still sleeping with lena.
what could she be thinking? - I don't know.
maybe she's wishing that kevin were straight so she could go forthe whole walker tri, kitty, that's disgusting.
Oh, look at that, mom. We're here. Gotta go.
no, we're not.
mom, do me a favor.
call isaac. - No.
call isaac. - No.
Bye.
I have so many questions about that conversation.
I have to get upearly tomorrow.
so?
I thought that we said that we were gonna take the night off.
look, I know. I just really don't feel like being at home tonight.
I mean, I can't handle another closed-door phone call between kitty and my momor, sarah, or god knows...
Oh, great.
your being hereis only gonna make it worse.
I don't care, okay?
I still have to goto work, justin. - Wait. Where are...
when you have a woken work, that's right. Well, uh, how's work?
what's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Isn't it a little awkward?
of course. It sucks.
then why don't you quit?
because unlike you, I don't live at my parents' house rent-free, and I don't have a bunch of money in the bank either. All right?
I need this paycheck.
do you actually think thatI like working for your brother?
okay, I'm sorry I brought this up, all right?
it's just--what are we doing?
everybody is pissed at us.
Rebecca hasn't talked to me since the wedding.
you and tommy are practically estranged.
when you and I started seeing each other, we said, you know, we wanted to have fun.
but now I don't know. You're just--you're being really intense.
intense? - Yeah, and I'm worried.
so what, you think I'm using again? - No.
Look,'cause I'm not, all right?
I'm going to my meetings, and you know what?
I-I even just found onefor vets, so...
that's--that's great.
what--what--what's the problem here?
you seem really angry lately. - Not at you.
Tommy's the one who screwed up, okay? Not us.
and I'm just sickand tired of everyone making us payfor his mistakes.
it think it's more complicated than that.
like what--what, do you still have feelings for him?
no.
no, of course not.
okay, so then what arewe worrying about?
you know, tommy and julia, they're gonna--they're gonna make it or not.
but you know what? That's their issue.
no, you're...you're--you're really--you're right.
all right. Come here.
can I stay?
Yeah.
is that new?
ish.
did you get it in phoenix?
actually, I got ita couple weeks ago...
for you.
it's nice.
you know, I was thinking maybe tomorrow, um, I could drive up, we could have lunch.
if--if that's okay.
Yeah, if you want to.
I think it'll be good for us to do things that we used to do before...you know, normal things.
Yeah, there's this new seafood restaurant. We...We could meet there if you want to.
okay, yeah, good. That sounds good.
sorry, sir, we're closed. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
what took you so long? - I don't just cook, kevin.
I also clean.
God, I would make such a good husband, wuldn't I?
don't worry, I'm not fishing.
Oh, speaking of which, I was left alone on the line to finish a grilled turbot when we ran out of cider vinegar sauce.
so I finished it with cubed red peppers and cumin.
and is that bad? - Well, it wasn't what they ordered.
I me, I was sort of flying by the seat of my pants.
but the server came in with compliments to the chef.
Bravo, poissonier. - Merci.
so...
what's new with you?
just depositions too boring to describe...
and jason called.
and jason called.
Yeah, he's back in L. A.
and he wants to meet for coffee...
tomorrow.
look, if you're at all uncomfortable with this, I can cancel.
it's absolutely no problem. - No, no. It's fine.
I mean, I knew he was gonna call eventually.
yeah and, you know he's robert's brother. It's not like I'm not gonna run into him.
Yeah, and you guys had some weird phone breakup, so yeah, I mean, go see him.
resolve whatever you need to resolve. - Look, I'm absolutely resolved.
Absolutely.
so I-I-I told him he could drop by.
I hope that's not A...problem.
Scotty, if you have any issues about this, please say,'cause i can cancel.
I said it was fine, kevin.
okay.
thank you for asking, but it's all good.
okay.
anyway, I am beat. Uh, let's go home.
I just don't understand what's bothering you, sarah.
this is a chance for use a huge splh.
theoretically, but what graham's proposing is too much, too soon.
but graham has had a huge success in china before.
he knows the markets. He has the contacts.
he has no vested interest in this company, saul.
he's a gambler.
are you really willing to risk everything that you, my father, tommy and everybody else spent years building for something that has no guarantees whatsoever?
you and I both know that there are no guarantees in life.
true, but there's degrees of risk.
there's calculated, sensible risk, and then there's graham finch.
why are you so invested in doing it his way?
I am invested in whatever is good for ojai.
okay, what about if we just split it in half?
we open with a hundred stores.
and what if we can't meet the increase?
what if there's a frost or, god forbid, a labor dispute?
what if we overextend ourselves and end up losing our existing contracts?
ten stores, saul, in two or three key cities.
we can handle that.
we can control quality, build reputation, create demand.
that's how dad did it.
this is your stubborn streak speaking, sarah.
you're welcome to try and whittle away mresistance.
I'm sure graham finch will be.
Sarah walker. - Oh, speak of the devil.
how soon can you get packed?
we've just got ourselves a meeting with the chairman of golden plum imports this evening in san francisco.
whoa, wait. What, today, this evening, this evening?
the chairman needs to be on a plane to beijing in the morning, and he agreed to meet with us at the hotel before he leaves.
we're nowhere near ready to present.
Sarah, simon lao is the man, and if we really want this, we need to be there.
I already booked the flights.
well, I'm just not comfortable winging it.
Graham's right. I think you should take this meeting.
well, I'm sorry, I'm not a wing-it type of girl.
you know, I would have gone myself, but he would only take the meeting if I assured him that the president of ojai would be there herself.
well, tell him you lied.
Sarah, what is wro with a wildly successful meeting followed by a-a fun night out in san francisco?
fun night out?
why wouldn't we be on the last plane home?
because there's no telling how long the meeting's gonna last.
come on, I already reserved two rooms at the hotel.
tell you what--fun night out is completely optional.
no, the fun night out, that's off the table.
okay, we'll go on my terms.
l. A.X.2: 30. Be prepared to argue the entire flight.
and be prepared to lose that argument.
that's--that's pretty much all I do these days.
so I guess video games are my new drug.
I mean, it's healthier than smack, right?
my girlfriend thinks it's weird to try and blot out iraq by running around shootin' things, but it seems to work.
I'm sam, and I'm an addict.
Hi, sam.
well, uh, it's not as exciting asombie killing, but the thing that gets me through is my wife pamela.
she's great.
but lately, she's been doing that thing, you know?
she wants to know what it was like over there.
I mean, I want to tell her...someday.
but at night, when I'm laying there not sleeping, and she's trying to help me out, the last thing I want to do is talk about that stuff.
it's like, can we please just have sex?
it was definitely easier when I was high.
I could just nod out.
but I guess if I'd wanted to take the easy route, I wouldn't have become a marine.
I wouldn't be coming here.
that's all.
okay.
anybody else feel like talking today?
no?
all right.
see you guys, uh, back here next time, okay?
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot chae, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
Amen.
see you next time.
see you.
Hey, uh, justin?
Hey.
so how you doing? - Good.
yeah? - Yeah.
uh, what'd you think of our little group?
I like it, yeah.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping that, uh, maybe one of these days you'd get up and talk.
Yeah, uh, it--it's not that I don't want to.
no, no. Well, whenever you're ready.
thank you. - Sure.
Thanks.
I'm gonna head up to santa barbara and check out those presses.
great.
you gonna be all right here?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
look, it's over between me and lena, okay?
it's done.
okay, the affair is over, but the possibility of a lawsuit is not.
it's not gonna come to that. - I hope not.
but while I am gone, just-- just please go by the book.
you'll leave the door open.
you won't make any comments about what she's wearing.
nothing suggestive.
I'll b careful. - Good.
hope I'm not interrupting.
no, not at all. I'm rushing out.
enjoy your lunch.
I thought, uh, we were gonna meet at the restaurant. - I know.
for the first time ever, the freeway was empty, so I figured I'd pick you up...
which apparently was a really stupid thing to do.
no, it's, uh...It's good.
well, I can try to reach her, but she just left for another meeting.
no, okay, okay.
Yeah, I'll-- I'll, uh, give her a call, and then I'll get right back to you.
is there a problem?
well, holly had a meeting with western trucking tomorrow, and now they want to do it this afternoon and...
you know what? Don't sweat it. I'll figure something out.
no, it's an important account.
if holly can't do it, I should-- tommy, why don't we just eat in?
look, if you're rushed for time, we can still have lunch together, and you can cover the meeting.
are you-- you sure it's okay? - Yeah, it's fine.
do you have any delivery menus?
Thanks.
so what are you in the mood for?
come in.
Hi.
I-I was just in the neighborhood, thought maybe you'd like to grab some lunch.
Oh, I'd--I'd love to, but, um, I have a strategy session in three minutes that I-- ah.
Yeah, it's-- uh, no, wait, wait.
I'm canceling my entire schedule for this evening.
would you have dinner with me?
this evening?
let me think.
I guess I could...cancel a few things.
good.
8: 00? - 8: 00. Well, you know where I live.
Yes, I do.
let's see.
how's that mandarin coming along? - Oh, very good.
yeah? - I can say hello.
after that, it's up to the translator.
did you know it was the year of the golden pig?
I--actually, I did.
it's a very auspicious time for new things, new ventures, new relationships.
actually, it's a very auspicious time to have a baby.
well, there's different kinds of babies, you know.
there's big, strong 100-store babies, tiny, little, feeble 10-store babies-- give it a rest, graham.
Sarah, seriously-- sarah.
no, sarah, you're making a big mistake.
Simon lao can partner with any company he likes. He respects strength.
if he thinks that we're playing it too safe, he's just gonna move on to somebody else.
and if we do it your way, we run the long-term risk of delivering them an inferior product, which is fine for you, because if they pull out, you'd just find another company to gamble with.
you know, there actually is some skill involved with what I do.
when are you gonna start trusting me?
just drop the flirting, close the deal, and then I'll think about it.
consider it closed.
50 stores? - No.
12 kiosks? - No.
so, uh, how's the taco?
it's okay.
you know, this new mexican place just opened right by my parents' house.
they have the bestish tacos.
is that where he took you?
what?
no, he did not take me for mexican food, and how can you even bring him up when she's sitting right outside the door?
you're the one who suggested eating here.
I thought we were going for normal, which obviously isn't working, probably because all I can think about is, did you do it on your desk, on hers?
like I don't have questions about the guy you slept with?
was it really just once? Was he good?
at least you know what you're going up against.
up against? - I didn't mean it like that.
WESTERN trucking's here.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I'll get out of your hair. - Julia, I'm sorry.
see you at home.
Hi.
Hi, kev.
the loft looks great.
Yeah, yeah, I-- yeah, I like...
um, li you still have this, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, oh, the wedding. I forgot to tell you about the wedding.
it was a total freak show. Kitty ran away from the altar.
Yeah, I can't believe I missed it.
robert told me all about it.
he must be excited you're back. - Yeah.
Yeah, he's already made me promise to campaign for him.
you're gonna campaign?
Kev, don't. He's--he's my brother.
well, yeah. Kitty's my sister.
you don't see me drinkin' the kool-aid.
didn't--didn't we once agree never to talk about this?
Yeah, we did.
you're right.
so, uh, how's work?
Oh, it's, uh-- hi.
what-- I got off work early.
Hi, I'm scotty.
of course. Good to meet you. - Good to meet you, too.
uh, uh, you know what?
WE'RE--WE'RE, uh, just in the middle of coffee, so maybe-- oh, no, of course. Enjoy.
I did bring home some soft-shell crabs, though.
they're not lobsters, but...
Jason, why don't you join us for dinner or late lunch or whatever it is?
uh-- no, no, no. I insist.
Kevin, tell him how well I do soft-shell crabs.
you know what? I don't think tonight's-- I'd love to.
great.
well, I'll get started in the kitchen and leave you two alone.
graham, this is not appropriate.
Oh, really? I-I thought they were kind of nice.
they are nice, but this is a business relationship, and they're just not appropriate.
Yeah, I know. - And this card--"good luck with your presentation"?
this is our presentation.
if I don't feel that we're together on this 100%, we should just get on a plane and go back to los angeles.
Sarah, we are together in this.
good. Where do you want these?
guess I'll just put 'em next to mine.
I'll tell the hotel you don't approve of their gift.
the hotel?
Yes, they really appreciate your business-- well, our business.
and you know that chocolate on your pillow?
it's not from me either.
this is...awkward. - Not for me.
uh, I'm gonna go get changed for the meeting.
don't think you're gonna get more stes just because I'm embarrassed.
what about something like this one?
Oh, good god in heaven, these can't possibly be mine.
how much weight can you lose in an hour and a half?
Becca, I have to tell you, I found out about tommy and your friend lena.
Oh, I'm so sorry, nora. - Here, help me.
it came out at the last family dinner. Of course. Where else?
obviously, julia and tommy have a whole lot to work on, but it really bothers me that she's still dating justin.
what kind of girl is she?
wait. Uh, they're still dating?
I thought you knew.
no, I-I had no idea.
I-I haven't spoken to either of them since kitty's wedding.
you haven't spoken to him since the wedding?
no, he hasn't called.
well, that's what I'm talking about.
he's just spending every waking hour with her.
you know, I-I just wish I never got her that job.
Oh, sweetheart, don't blame yourself. It's not your fault.
Oh, that's nice.
I want something quiet and elegant and sophisticated, like he is.
Youreally like this guy.
what are you doing here?
I was just, um, upstairs helping your mom get ready for her date with isaac.
cool. - Yeah.
And?
Justin, why didn't you just tell me that you're still dating lena?
sorry I forgot to send out the memo.
no, I just don't understand, because, like, don't you care that she slept with tommy?
I mean-- it was a mistake, okay?
Really? Because usually when people do something over and over again, that's not really a mistake.
that's--that's more of a hobby or-- or--or what? An addiction, right?
I didn't say that but, you know, now that you mention it, there are some glaring similarities.
look, this is ridiculous. - Is it?
because it seems pretty self-destructive, what you're doing.
I mean, you're tearing your family apart. Like, why is it a secret?
why won't you just tell everyone? - I don't need this.
if you have a problem with me dating lena, that's exactly what it is.
it's your problem, okay? - I don't have a problem.
the bottom line is you're hurting people, justin, and you're gonna get hurt.
uh, I'm feeling a little entourage-deficient.
I'll try not to take that comment personally.
which one's the translator?
you're the translator?
you're at my mercy, aren't you?
ten stores. Ten stores.
Hey, I just wanted to check in. Today was pretty awkward.
I just want to make sure everything's okay.
everything's fine.
Thanks.
look, uh, I know that it isn't easy with me being here.
and julia didn't seem happy.
no, she's not.
well, I'm sorry. - Don't be.
it's not your problem.
but...
Justin is.
is that your way of asking me about him?
I just--I don't...
I don't know where it's going.
join the club.
I mean, I have no idea where julia and I are going either.
you know, it's actually easier to talk to you than her right now.
Yeah, well, it's always been easy with us.
Yeah.
uh, what--what are you doing?
no, wait. I-I just-- I thought you said...
I don't know what I said, but I-I-I love julia.
I'm sorry.
no, it's, uh...
you really thinkhe's gonna win.
well, I never call a race before it's over.
good, thank you.
you tell me what you think about this.
it's south african and surprising.
I don't ch like surprises.
well, I think you'll like this o.
that's wonderful.
have you ever been to South Africa?
no, have you?
Oh, about five years ago, before my wife claire got sick, I took the whole family.
well, I went to west africa to explore my ancestry.
we went to mali and to car senegal and the gambia.
it was quite a trip.
Really?
if I were to explore my ancestry, I don't know where I'd go.
I don't know where I come from.
I'm a little of this and a little of that.
I'm a mutt.
well, I'd say you're a very well-put-together mutt.
so what, you just wanted company on the plane?
trust me, your being here is crucial to us getting this deal.
how? All I did was nod. I would ve liked the chance to present.
well, you didn't see mr. Lao talking, did you?
it makes you seem more powerful if you let your minions speak for you.
I didn't even know what you said.
if I hear anything about a hundred stores, I swear-- sarah, trust me.
miss walker.
we are very impressed with your proposal. - Thank you.
we would like ojai, california, produce on the shelves as soon as possible.
in how many stores?
well, Mr. Finch makes a very strong case.
we would like to start with our ten flagship stores.
thank you, Mr. Lao.
that is very good news.
Ah, please forgive me, but i have an early flight tomorrow.
of course.
I look forward to doing business, and I wish you and your family every success in the coming year.
thank you very much.
my family?
well, I may have accidentally let slip that your brother-in-law is about to become president.
you didn't! - Tell me off later over a drink, okay?
so, jason, where exactly were you in malaysia?
were you--were you in the middle of the jungle?
well, I was just outside of kota kinabalu.
Kota... - kinabalu.
Yeah, it was-- it was very jungly.
must have been hard being so far away from your home.
it was isolating, yeah.
I thought you were so engrossed in your work, you wouldn't have time for thoughts like that.
I was hoping it would be that way, but, uh, you know, the truth is, I ju wanted to come home.
I felt like that every single time I went to summer camp.
I think I called home twice a day.
calling home wasn't really aoption for me.
why not? No cell phone coverage?
I was having a crisis of faith, actually.
Really? I didn't know that.
Oh, but then, you didn't tell me.
I'm--I'm sorry. I was spending my time talking to god.
at least you were talkin' to someone.
and you don't need a cell phone to talk to god, right?
I'm gonna go to the kitchen. Can I get anybody anything?
why don't you just drop the hostess act?
okay.
you guys had things to resolve. It's obvious.
so why bring home crustaceans?
I-I'd love to know what you think we have to resolve.
I have nothing to resolve. - He keeps saying that.
no, no, it's quite simple, honestly.
we were together, he went to malaysia, I never heard from him again, end of story.
Oh, really? Okay, what about the part where you promised to wait for me and then broke up with me on the phone?
I'm surprised you picked up the phone.
you want to know why I didn't call? - Why?
I thought it would make it worse.
worse? - I missed you too much, okay?
I-I thought if I could just focus on where I was and what I was ting to do.
you know-- you know what that is? - That's the worst excuse I've ever heard.
you made me feel like we were through, over, like I was some materialistic guy you had no time for.
and you guys have nothing to resolve. Right.
stay out of thisfor one minute. - No.
why don't you just ask him why he came home? I'm sure you want to know.
well, it wasn't for him, if that's what you're thinking.
he dumped me.
that's when I found my spiritual strength-- finally.
so god won after all.
Yes, kevin. In a contest between you and god, god won.
great. So everything worked out for the best.
Yeah, perfect.
Hi.
what is this stuff?
you said you had some questions about him, so I thought I'd answer them.
that's his yearbook picture...pictures from prom, letters from high school, everything.
and what about you and lena? When did you sleep with her?
I told you.
it was a couple weeks after you left, and, uh, you accused me of being responsible for william's death.
you remember that?
so while you were off dealing with your emotions, how did--how did you just hook up with your ex-boyfriend?
I was dealing with my emotions.
I was also bored and lonely, and I ran into someone I knew, and we had a couple drinks, and--and I got hammered!
what about you and lena? Were you drunk?
Yeah, the first time. - The first time?
so were you sober the second, third-- you went away, all right?
gone! Nothing! - You think that gives you a right to cheat?
well, what's your excuse?
I'll get her. - No, tommy.
we've got to figure this out...for her.
I know.
I know I owe you two weeks notice and that I'm not being professional or whatever, but I just-- I can't be here anymore.
did something happen?
listen, I'm not gonna sue or anything, if that's what you're worried about.
what made you decide to do this now?
I thought I was in love with tommy...
but clearly...
I'm screwed up.
when I was with william, I thought, this isn't perfect, it's a compromise, but it's my choice.
I even thought that I was in control.
and for 20 years, I let that idea and that man dictate who I was.
when I finally realized that I was just filling in the gap for somebody else's relationship, it was too late, and I couldn't leave.
it is better if you figure this out now.
I hope so.
use this opportunity to find something that's yours.
okay, make it for 10: 00, and then change the 2: 00.
all right.
I'm--I'm sorry. - That's okay.
how are you, nora?
well, I've hardly seen justin all week, but you'll be very happy to hear that tommy and julia have said that they really, truly have.
I asked, how are you?
not your kids.
how am I?
have no idea.
uh, travis?
I'm not gonna deal with that right now, so don't call back.
I'm dealing with something extremely important.
you understand?
I'm sorry.
that's okay.
you're right.
this wine is surprising...
a very nice surprise.
I'll say this for my brother-in-law-- he's certainly the best-looking candidate we've ever had.
Yeah, not to mention he'd make a damn fine president.
to senator mccallister and his unwitting assist in today's victory.
I suppose if my sister has to marry a republican, I should benefitin some fashion.
well, you know, you're just gonna end up being so rich that, uh, you're probably gonna have to become a republican yourself.
that's a depressing thought.
okay, so what happens if robert doesn't make it to the white house?
well, that connection just got us in the door.
by election day, they're gonna be so impressed by ojai foods and by you, it's...
it's not gonna matter.
well, I hope you're right.
to golden plum. - And its ten flagship stores.
so now you don't want mccallister to win?
why is that?
wrong party, though I suppose it'd be fun to go to the inaugural ball.
Oh, fun.
you need a date? I've got a tux and everything.
I'm weighing my options.
Oh, damn.
you know, I'm afraid you're gonna have to go on option-weighing because, uh, I got a late dinner.
what happened to our fun night out in san francisco?
I'm--I'm sorry, but I-I really thought our night out was off the table.
it--it was. I'm just kidding.
Hi.
sorry.
I was, um, waiting in the lobby. - Oh, not at all.
uh, yvonne calo, this is rah walker.
I'm actually doing, uh, work for her company at the moment.
be careful of this one.
he'll make you a ton of money, and then you'll never want to let him go.
that's right.
I'll try to remember that.
Oh, and, uh, just to remind you that tomorrow morning the car's coming really early--7: 30.
okay.
nice to meet you, yvonne. - You, too.
figures.
okay, if you're not gonna talk about what happened tonight, I'm gonna go out.
nothing to talk about. You ambushed my tea party.
I got out of work early. - No, no, no. You made sure you got out of work early.
okay, fine. Well, actually, now I know what's going on.
well, I'm glad you do, because I don't. - Exactly.
you don't know. You don't know how you feel about me, about him, about anything.
if you did, you might have to choose, really choose, instead of...instead of pretending.
is that what we're doing, pretending? - You tell me.
because I don't feel like I live here.
I stay here because you let me.
do you realize there's nothing in this apartment that's mine except clothes?
what do you want me to do, scotty? - Be honest with me.
if you're still in love with jason mccallister.
no, I am not in love with jason mccallister.
why do you have to be so jealous?
because if you could see the two of you together-- if you don't trust me, leave.
fine.
Oh, god. Where are you going? - I'm leaving.
isn't that what you want? - Yeah, it is. Have a great night.
Where's, uh, where's mom?
uh, I don't know. Think she's out with isaac.
mind if I join you?
Yeah, whatever.
listen, I...
I know it hasn't been easy between us, and we haven't exactly been honest with each other, and you're probably gonna want to kill me.
but, um...
Lena tried to kiss me.
I know.
you do?
Yeah, she told methe whole story.
look, I didn't do anything. - I-- I know. She said it was her fault, you know.
it's fine. We broke up anyway.
you okay?
not really, but I guess it's probably what's best for me.
turns out if you want to escape reality, sex is almost as good as pills.
tell me about it.
I'm sorry, man.
me, too.
you know, sometimes it really sucks we can't have a beer together.
well, we can. You just have to drink it.
go away. I'm busy.
would you please open the door? - No.
Scotty, open the door.
wow, I love what you've done with the place.
Yeah, well, at least it's mine.
I'm sorry. - No, I...shouldn't have barged in on your tea party.
Yeah, enough with the shellfish now.
but you know what? When you walked in, I was secretly so proud.
of what?
of you, of how genuine you are and how crazy and honest and jealous.
so how do I make this better?
I don't want you to see him anymore.
even if I did, it wouldn't mean anything.
I know you're gonna run into him at family stuff.
I just don't want you making plans with him.
okay.
promise.
Really?
I don't think you get how much I want us to be together.
God, now I feel like an idiot for asking.
Why?
it only makes me want you even more.
you know what?
I-I actually do have to go to work, and I don't want to get caught getting busy in a 1970s ranchero...
beautiful as it is.
I'll see you when y get home? - Okay.
so, uh, lena quit last night.
did you ask her to? - No.
Holly said it was her decision. I don't-- I don't know the details.
Hey, come on, this is a good thing.
she's not the problem.
we are.
I think we need to see someone.
and I know you don't like to ask for help, and I know the last thing you want to do is talk to some stranger about our personal lives, but...
Yes.
whatever it takes, we'll do it.
thank you.
hey there.
Mr. Finch.
missed you on the plane this morning. I hope yvette made you a nice breakfast.
actually, it's yvonne.
and, uh, would you believe me if I told you she just wanted investment advice, and I left her at a perfectly reasonable hour?
not so much.
okay.
uh, I did advise her to invest in a working alarm clock, though.
listen, uh, you were right yesterday. I'd have scared them off.
well, you're the reason we were there, so thank you.
my pleasure.
and I still owe you a fun night out.
don't hold your breath.
okay.
Hello?
Oh, hey, I heard that dinner went really well.
you did?
you talked to him? All right, what did he say?
Oh, well, that's privilege campaign information, mother. Sorry.
okay, he--he seemed very happy, smitten, even.
smitten, even? - He did.
he just--he--he said that he had a great time.
he did?
you know what? - What?
we had a really great time.
okay. Just remember, mom. Remember what you always used to say to me.
yeah? - You just take it slow.
you make him wait.
remember the last time we were here? I'd just found out you existed.
Yeah, you were, ke, the only one in your family that was actually talking to me.
it's crazy, huh?
Yeah, now you're, like, the only one that's not talking to me.
look, Rebecca, I just want to say I'm sorry.
look, you were right about lena and about everything.
say it. - What?
you know what.
I wasn't gonna say anything.
told you so. - I knew it!
eat THIS FOOD EVERY DAY.
don't YOU THINK IT WOULD TASTE A LOT BETTER COMING FROM YOUR ORCHARDS?
I'm having a big family dinner.
why don't you join us?
that SOUNDS GREAT.
mom's REALLY INTO THIS GUY ISAAC.
but IF SHE WANTS US TO GO OVER TO THE HOUSE AND HAVE DINNER,
that's WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.
Tommy HAD AN AFFAIR WITH LENA.
I NEVER LIKED THAT GIRL.
if YOU'RE GONNA BLAME ANYONE, BLAME TOMMY.
your OPINION DOESN'T COUNT BECAUSE YOU SLEPT WITH LENA, TOO.
I'm STILL SLEEPING WITH HER.
it's NOT JUST THAT YOU SLEPT WITH LENA.
did IT, TOO. I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.
you WHAT? - WE WENT OUT IN HIGH SCHOOL.
it WAS A MIS??
was SHE? WAS LENA A MISTAKE?
Yeah, SHE WAS.
Scotty, JASON IS COMING BACK. HE--HE--HE CONTACTED ME.
Hey, MOM.
good SWEET GOD IN HEAVEN, WAS THAT YOU?
no, that would be Typhoid Travis,
attempting TO SPREAD HIS PLAGUE TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IOWA.
those GOOD PEOPLE GAVE ME THIS PLAGUE.
so...
is ISAAC SICK, TOO?
no, TRAVIS WOULD BE THE ONLY ONE SUFFERING AT THE MOMENT, THANK GOD.
don't DRINK SO MUCH!
I DON'T. I HARDLY DRINK AT ALL.
I THOUGHT MAYBE IF HE WAS SICK, THAT'S WHY HE HADN'T CALLED.
and THEN WHO COULD BLAME HIM, YOU KNOW,
after THE DINNER PARTY FROM HELL.
no, MOM, HE'S JUST BUSY WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY, THAT'S ALL.
you don't have to make excuses. I can take rejection.
mom, I'M NOT MAKING EXCUSES.
i-it TURNS OUT THAT PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS ARE KIND OF TIME-CONSUMING, OKAY?
you know what you should do?
go DOWN TO THE OFFICE, AND YOU SHOULD ASK HIM OUT FOR LUNCH.
God, NO. THAT IS JUST WAY TOO FORWARD.
mom, you know what?
the MAN WATCHED OUR FAMILY DISINTEGRATE OVER PAELLA.
I THINK YOU'RE PAST THE TOO-FORWARD STAGE.
and whatever happened with Julia and Tommy anyway?
I DON'T KNOW.
I NEVER TALK TO THEM ANYMORE. I DON'T EVEN TALK TO JUSTIN,
who I GUESS IS STILL SLEEPING WITH LENA.
what COULD SHE BE THINKING? - I don't know.
maybe SHE'S WISHING THAT KEVIN WERE STRAIGHT
so SHE COULD GO FOR THE WHOLE WALKER TRIFECTA.
Kitty, THAT'S DISGUSTING. - OH, LOOK AT THAT, MOM.
we're HERE. GOTTA GO.
no, WE'RE NOT.
mom, DO ME A FAVOR. CALL ISAAC.
no.
call ISAAC! - NO!
Bye.
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT CONVERSATION.
I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY TOMORROW
so?
I THOUGHT THAT WE SAID THAT WE WERE GONNA TAKE THE NIGHT OFF.
look, I KNOW. I JUST REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING AT HOME TONIGHT.
I MEAN, I CAN'T HANDLE ANOTHER CLOSED-DOOR PHONE CALL BETWEEN KITTY AND MY MOM OR SARAH OR GOD KNOWS
Oh, GREAT. YOUR BEING HERE IS ONLY GONNA MAKE IT WORSE.
I DON'T CARE, OKAY?
I STILL HAVE TO GO TO WORK, JUSTIN.
wait. WHERE ARE...
work, THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, UH, HOW'S WORK?
what's THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
nothing. ISN'T IT A LITTLE AWKWARD?
of COURSE. IT SUCKS.
then WHY DON'T YOU QUIT?
because UNLIKE YOU,
I DON'T LIVE AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE RENT-FREE,
and I DON'T HAVE A BUNCH OF MONEY IN THE BANK EITHER. ALL RIGHT?
I NEED THIS PAYCHECK.
do YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT I LIKE WORKING FOR YOUR BROTHER?
okay, I'M SORRY I BROUGHT THIS UP, ALL RIGHT?
it's JUST
what ARE WE DOING?
everybody IS PISSED AT US.
Rebecca HASN'T TALKED TO ME SINCE THE WEDDING.
you AND TOMMY ARE PRACTICALLY ESTRANGED.
when YOU AND I STARTED SEEING EACH OTHER, WE SAID,
you KNOW, WE WANTED TO HAVE FUN.
but NOW I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE JUST
you're BEING REALLY INTENSE.
intense? - YEAH, AND I'M WORRIED.
so WHAT, YOU THINK I'M USING AGAIN?
no.
look, 'CAUSE I'M NOT, ALL RIGHT?
I'm GOING TO MY MEETINGS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I-I EVEN JUST FOUND ONE FOR VETS, SO...
that's--that's GREAT.
what--what-- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?
you SEEM REALLY ANGRY LATELY.
not AT YOU.
Tommy's THE ONE WHO SCREWED UP, OKAY? NOT US.
and I'M JUST SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYONE MAKING US PAY FOR HIS MISTAKES.
I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.
like WHAT--WHAT, DO YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM?
no. NO, OF COURSE NOT.
okay, SO THEN WHAT ARE WE WORRYING ABOUT?
you KNOW, TOMMY AND JULIA, THEY'RE GONNA
they're GONNA MAKE IT OR NOT.
but YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S THEIR ISSUE.
no, YOU'RE... YOU'RE--YOU'RE REALLY--YOU'RE RIGHT.
all RIGHT. COME HERE.
can I STAY?
Yeah.
is THAT NEW? - ISH.
did YOU GET IT IN PHOENIX?
actually, I GOT IT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO...
for YOU.
it's NICE.
you KNOW, I WAS THINKING MAYBE TOMORROW, UM,
I COULD DRIVE UP, WE COULD HAVE LUNCH.
if--if THAT'S OKAY.
Yeah, IF YOU WANT TO.
I THINK IT'LL BE GOOD FOR US TO DO THINGS THAT WE USED TO DO BEFORE...
you KNOW, NORMAL THINGS.
Yeah, THERE'S THIS NEW SEAFOOD RESTAURANT. WE...
we COULD MEET THERE IF YOU WANT TO.
okay, YEAH, GOOD. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
sorry, SIR, WE'RE CLOSED.
I'm GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.
what TOOK YOU SO LONG?
I DON'T JUST COOK, KEVIN.
I ALSO CLEAN.
God, I WOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD HUSBAND, WOULDN'T I?
don't WORRY, I'M NOT FISHING. OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I WAS LEFT ALONE ON THE LINE TO FINISH A GRILLED TURBOT
when WE RAN OUT OF CIDER VINEGAR SAUCE.
so I FINISHED IT WITH CUBED RED PEPPERS AND CUMIN.
and IS THAT BAD?
well, IT WASN'T WHAT THEY ORDERED.
I ME, I WAS SORT OF FLYING BY THE SEAT OF MY PANTS.
but THE SERVER CAME IN WITH COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF.
Wow. BRA, POISSONIER.
Merci.
so...
what's NEW WITH YOU?
just DEPOSITIONS TOO BORING TO DESCRIBE...
and JASON CALLED.
and JASON CALLED.
Yeah, HE'S BACK IN L. A.
and HE WANTS TO MEET FOR COFFEE...
tomorrow.
look, IF YOU'RE AT ALL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS, I CAN CANCEL.
it's ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM. - NO, NO. IT'S FINE.
I MEAN, I KNEW HE WAS GONNA CALL EVENTUALLY.
yeah AND, YOU KNOW HE'S ROBERT'S BROTHER.
it's NOT LIKE I'M NOT GONNA RUN INTO HIM.
so YEAH, I MEAN, GO SEE HIM.
resolve WHATEVER YOU NEED TO RESOLVE.
look, I'M ABSOLUTELY RESOLVED. ABSOLUTELY.
so I-I-I TOLD HIM HE COULD DROP BY.
I HOPE THAT'S NOT A... PROBLEM.
Scotty, IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES ABOUT THIS, PLEASE SAY, - 'CAUSE I CAN CANCEL. - I SAID IT WAS FINE, KEVIN.
okay. - THANK YOU FOR ASKING, - BUT IT'S ALL GOOD. - OKAY.
anyway, I AM BEAT.
uh, LET'S GO HOME.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, SARAH.
this IS A CHANCE FOR US TO MAKE A HUGE SPLH.
but GRAHAM HAS HAD A HUGE SUCCESS IN CHINA BEFORE.
he KNOWS THE ARKETS. HE HAS THE CONTACTS.
he HAS NO VESTED INTEREST IN THIS COMPANY, SAUL.
he's A GAMBLER.
are YOU REALLY WILLING TO RISK EVERYTHING THAT YOU, MY FATHER, TOMMY AND EVERYBODY ELSE SPENT YEARS BUILDING FOR SOMETHING THAT HAS NO GUARANTEES WHATSOEVER?
you AND I BOTH KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES IN LIFE.
true, BUT THERE'S DEGREES OF RISK.
there's CALCULATED, SENSIBLE RISK,
and THEN THERE'S GRAHAM FINCH.
why ARE YOU SO INVESTED IN DOING IT HIS WAY?
I AM INVESTED IN WHATEVER IS GOOD FOR OJAI.
okay, WHAT ABOUT IF WE JUST SPLIT IT IN HALF?
we OPEN WITH A HUNDRED STORES.
and WHAT IF WE CAN'T MEET THE INCREASE?
what IF THERE'S A FROST OR, GOD FORBID, A LABOR DISPUTE?
what IF WE OVEREXTEND OURSELVES
and END UP LOSING OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS?
ten STORES, SAUL, IN TWO OR THREE KEY CITIES.
we CAN HANDLE THAT.
we CAN CONTROL QUALITY, BUILD REPUTATION, CREATE DEMAND.
that's DAD DID IT.
this IS YOUR STUBBORN STREAK SPEAKING, SARAH.
you're WELCOME TO TRY AND WHITTLE AWAY MRESISTANCE.
I'm SURE GRAHAM FINCH WILL BE.
Sarah WALKER. - OH, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.
how SOON CAN YOU GET PACKED?
we've JUST GOT OURSELVES A MEETING WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF GOLDEN PLUM IMPORTS THIS EVENING IN SAN FRANCISCO.
whoa, WAIT. WHAT, TODAY?
the CHAIRMAN NEEDS TO BE ON A PLANE TO BEIJING IN THE MORNING,
and HE AGREED TO MEET WITH US AT THE HOTEL BEFORE HE LEAVES.
we're NOWHERE NEAR READY TO PRESENT.
Sarah, SIMON LAO IS THE MAN,
and IF WE REALLY WANT THIS, WE NEED TO BE THERE.
I ALREADY BOOKED THE FLIGHTS.
well, I'M ST NOT COMFORTABLE WINGING IT.
Graham's RIGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS MEETING.
well, I'M SORRY, I'M NOT A WING-IT TYPE OF GIRL.
but HE WOULD ONLY TAKE THE MEETING IF I ASSURED HIM THAT THE PRESIDENT OF OJAI WOULD BE THERE HERSELF.
well, TELL HIM YOU LIED.
Sarah, WHAT IS WRO WITH A WILDLY SUCCESSFUL MEETING
followed BY A-A FUN NIGHT OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO?
fun NIGHT OUT?
why WOULDN'T WE BE ON THE LAST PLANE HOME?
because THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG THE MEETING'S GONNA LAST.
come ON, I ALREADY RESERVED TWO ROOMS AT THE HOTEL.
tell YOU WHAT--FUN NIGHT OUT IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.
no, THE FUN NIGHT OUT, THAT'S OFF THE TABLE.
okay, WE'LL GO ON MY TERMS.
l. A.X. 2: 30. BE PREPARED TO ARGUE THE ENTIRE FLIGHT.
and BE PREPARED TO LOSE THAT ARGUMENT.
that's--that's PRETTY MUCH ALL I DO THESE DAYS.
so I GUESS VIDEO GAMES ARE MY NEW DRUG.
I MEAN, IT'S HEALTHIER THAN SMACK, RIGHT?
my GIRLFRIEND THINKS IT'S WEIRD TO TRY AND BLOT OUT IRAQ BY RUNNING AROUND SHOOTIN' THINGS,
but IT SEEMS TO WORK.
I'm SAM, AND I'M AN ADDICT.
Hi, SAM.
well, UH, IT'S NOT AS EXCITING ASOMBIE KILLING,
but THE THING THAT GETS ME THROUGH IS MY WIFE PAMELA.
she's GREAT.
but LATELY, SHE'S BEEN DOING THAT THING, YOU KNOW?
she WANTS TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE OVER THERE.
I MEAN, I WANT TO TELL HER...
someday.
but AT NIGHT, WHEN I'M LAYING THERE NOT SLEEPING,
and SHE'S TRYING TO HELP ME OUT,
the LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF.
it's LIKE, CAN WE PLEASE JUST HAVE SEX?
it WAS DEFINITELY EASIER WHEN I WAS HIGH.
I COULD JUST NOD OUT.
but I GUESS IF I'D WANTED TO TAKE THE EASY ROUTE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE BECOME A MARINE.
I WOULDN'T BE COMING HERE.
that's ALL.
okay. ANYBODY ELSE FEEL LIKE TALKING TODAY?
no? ALL RIGHT.
see YOU GUYS, UH, BACK HERE NEXT TIME, OKAY?
God GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHAE,
the COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN,
and THE WISDOM TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
Amen.
see YOU NEXT TIME. SEE YOU.
Hey, UH, JUSTIN?
Hey.
so HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD.
yeah? - YEAH.
uh, WHAT'D YOU THINK OF OUR LITTLE GROUP?
I LIKE IT, YEAH.
Yeah, I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT, UH, MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS
you'd GET UP AND TALK.
Yeah, UH, IT--IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T WANT TO.
no, NO. WELL, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
thank YOUã€‚
I'm GONNA HEAD UP TO SANTA BARBARA - AND CHECK OUT THOSE PRESSES. - GREAT.
you GONNA BE ALL RIGHT HERE?
Yeah. WHY WOULDN'T I BE?
look, IT'S OVER BETWEEN ME AND LENA, OKAY? IT'S DONE.
okay, THE AFFAIR IS OVER,
but THE POSSIBILITY OF A LAWSUIT IS NOT.
it's NOT GONNA COME TO THAT. - I HOPE NOT.
but WHILE I AM GONE, JUST-- JUST PLEASE GO BY THE BOOK.
you'll LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN.
you WON'T MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHE'S WEARING.
nothing SUGGESTIVE.
I'll BE CAREFUL. - GOOD.
Hey. - HEY.
hope I'M NOT INTERRUPTING. - NO, NOT AT ALL. I'M RUSHING OUT.
okay. - ENJOY YOUR LUNCH.
okay.
Hey. - HEY.
I THOUGHT, UH, WE WERE GONNA MEET AT THE RESTAURANT.
I KNOW. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THE FREEWAY WAS EMPTY,
so I FIGURED I'D PICK YOU UP...
which APPARENTLY WAS A REALLY STUPID THING TO DO.
no, IT'S, UH... IT'S GOOD.
well, I CAN TRY TO REACH HER,
but SHE JUST LEFT FOR ANOTHER MEETING.
no, OKAY, OKAY. YEAH, I'LL-- I'LL, UH, GIVE HER A CALL,
and THEN I'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU.
is THERE A PROBLEM?
well, HOLLY HAD A MEETING WITH WESTERN TRUCKING TOMORROW,
and NOW THEY WANT TO DO IT THIS AFTERNOON AND...
you KNOW WHAT? DON'T SWEAT IT.
I'll FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. - NO, IT'S AN IMPORTANT ACCOUNT.
if HOLLY CAN'T DO IT, I SHOULD
look, IF YOU'RE RUSHED FOR TIME,
we CAN STILL HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER, AND YOU CAN COVER THE MEETING.
are YOU-- YOU SURE IT'S OKAY?
Yeah, IT'S FINE.
do YOU HAVE ANY DELIVERY MENUS?
Thanks.
so WHAT ARE YOU IN THE MOOD FOR?
come IN.
Hi.
I-I WAS JUST IN THE NEIGHRHOOD,
thought MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO GRAB SOME LUNCH.
Oh, I'D--I'D LOVE, BUT, UM,
I HAVE A STRATEGY SESSION IN THREE MINUTES - THAT I-- - AH. YEAH, IT'S
no, WAIT, WAIT.
I'm CANCELING MY ENTIRE SCHEDULE FOR THIS EVENING.
would YOU HAVE DINNER WITH ME?
this EVENING? LET ME THINK.
I GUESS I COULD...
cancel A FEW THINGS.
good.
8: 00? - 8: 00.
well, YOU KNOW WHERE I LIVE. - YES, I DO.
let's SEE.
how's THAT MANDARIN COMING ALONG?
Oh, VERY GOOD. - YEAH?
I CAN SAY HELLO. AFTER THAT, IT'S UP TO THE TRANSLATOR.
did YOU KNOW IT WAS THE YEAR OF THE GOLDEN PIG?
I--ACTUALLY, I DID.
it's A VERY AUSPICIOUS TIME FOR NEW THINGS,
new VENTURES, NEW RELATIONSHIPS.
actually, IT'S A VERY AUSPICIOUS TIME TO HAVE A BABY.
well, THERE'S DIFFERENT KINDS OF BABIES, YOU KNOW.
there's BIG, STRONG 100-STORE BABIES,
tiny, LITTLE, FEEBLE 10-STORE BABIES
give IT A REST, GRAHAM. - SARAH, SERIOUSLY
Sarah. NO, SARAH, YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.
Simon LAO CAN PARTNER WITH ANY COMPANY HE LIKES.
he RESPECTS STRENGTH.
if HE THINKS THAT WE'RE PLAYING IT TOO SAFE,
he's JUST GONNA MOVE ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
and IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY,
we RUN THE LONG-TERM RISK OF DELIVERING THEM
an INFERIOR PRODUCT, WHICH IS FINE FOR YOU,
because IF THEY PULL OUT,
you'd JUST FIND ANOTHER COMPANY TO GAMBLE WITH.
you KNOW, THERE ACTUALLY IS SOME SKILL INVOLVED WITH WHAT I DO.
when ARE YOU GONNA START TRUSTING ME?
and THEN I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
consider IT CLOSED.
50 STORES? - NO.
12 KIOSKS? - NO.
so, UH,
how's THE TACO?
it's OKAY. YOU KNOW,
this NEW MEXICAN PLACE JUST OPENED RIGHT BY MY PARENTS' HOUSE.
they HAVE THBESTISH TACOS.
is THAT WHERE HE TOOK YOU?
what?
no, HE DID NOT TAKE ME FOR MEXICAN FOOD,
and HOW CAN YOU EVEN BRING HIM UP
when SHE'S SITTING RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR?
you're THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED EATING HERE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING FOR NORMAL,
which OBVIOUSLY ISN'T WORKING,
probably BECAUSE ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS,
did YOU DO IT ON YOUR DESK, ON HERS?
was IT REALLY JUST ONCE? WAS HE GOOD?
at LEAST YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING UP AGAINST.
up AGAINST? - I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
WESTERN Trucking's here.
Yeah, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. - I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.
Julia, I'M SORRY. - SEE YOU AT HOME.
Hi.
Hi, KEV.
the LOFT LOOKS GREAT.
Yeah, YEAH, I-- YEAH, I LIKE...
um, LIVING HERE.
you STILL HAVE THIS, HUH?
Yeah.
Oh, OH, THE WEDDING. I FORGOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE WEDDING.
it WAS A TOTAL FREAK SHOW. KITTY RAN AWAY FROM THE ALTAR.
robert TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT.
he MUST BE EXCITED YOUE BACK.
Yeah. YEAH, HE'S ALREADY MADE ME PROMISE TO CAMPAIGN FOR HIM.
you're GONNA CAMPAIGN?
Kev, DON'T. HE'S--HE'S MY BROTHER.
well, YEAH. KITTY'S MY STER.
you DON'T SEE ME DRINKIN' THE KOOL-AID.
Yeah. YEAH, WE DID. YOU'RE RIGHT.
so, UH, HOW'S WORK?
Oh, IT'S, UH
Hi.
Hi. WHAT-- - I GOT OFF WORK EARLY.
Hi, I'M SCOTTY. - OF COURSE. GOOD TO MEET YOU.
good TO MEET YOU, TOO.
uh, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE--WE'RE, UH,
just IN THE MIDDLE OF COFFEE, SO MAYBE
Oh, NO, OF COURSE. ENJOY.
I DID BRING HOME SOME SOFT-SHELL CRABS, THOUGH THEY'RE NOT LOBSTERS, BUT...
Jason, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US FOR DINNER
or LATE LUNCH OR WHATEVER IT IS?
no, NO, NO. I INSIST.
Kevin, TELL HIM HOW WELL I DO SOFT-SHELL CRABS.
you KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK TONIGHT'S
I'd LOVE TO.
great.
well, I'LL GET STARTED IN THE KITCHEN
and LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.
graham, THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
Oh, REALLY? I-I THOUGHT THEY WERE KIND OF NICE.
they ARE NICE, BUT THIS IS A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP,
and THEY'RE JUST NOT APPROPRIATE.
Yeah, I KNOW. - AND THIS CARD
good LUCK WITH YOUR PRESENTATION?
this IS OUR PRESENTATION.
if I DON'T FEEL THAT WE'RE TOGETHER ON THIS 100%,
we SHOULD JUST GET ON A PLANE AND GO BACK TO LOS ANGELES.
Sarah, WE ARE TOGETHER IN THIS.
good. WHERE DO YOU WANT THESE?
guess I'LL JUST PUT 'EM NEXT TO NE.
I'll TELL THE HOTEL YOU DON'T APPROVE OF THEIR GIFT.
the HOTEL?
Yes, THEY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS
well, OUR BUSINESS.
and YOU KNOW THAT CHOCOLATE ON YOUR PILLOW?
it's NOT FROM ME EITHER.
this IS... AWKWARD. - NOT FOR ME.
uh, I'M GONNA GO GET CHANGED FOR THE MEETING.
don't THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET MORE STES JUST BECAUSE I'M EMBARRASSED.
what ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS ONE?
Oh, GOOD GOD IN HEAVEN, THESE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE MINE.
how MUCH WEIGHT CAN YOU LOSE IN AN HOUR AND A HALF?
Becca, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I FOUND OUT ABOUT TOMMY AND YOUR FRIEND LENA.
Oh, I'M SO SORRY, NORA. - HERE, HELP ME.
it CAME OUT AT THE LAST FAMILY DINNER. OF COURSE. WHERE ELSE?
obviously, JULIA AND TOMMY HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO WORK ON,
but IT REALLY BOTHERS ME THAT SHE'S STILL DATING JUSTIN.
what KIND OF GIRL IS SHE?
wait. UH, THEY'RE STILL DATING?
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
no. NO, I-I HAD NO IDEA.
I-I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO EITHER OF THEM SINCE KITTY'S WEDDING.
you HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM SINCE THE WEDDING?
no. NO, HE HASN'T CALLED.
well, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
he's JUST SPENDING EVERY WAKING HOUR WITH HER.
you KNOW, I-I JUST WISH I NEVER GOT HER THAT JOB.
sweetheart, DON'T BLAME YOURSELF. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
Oh, THAT'S NICE.
I WANT SOMETHING...
quiet AND ELEGANT AND SOPHISTICATED,
like HE IS.
Wow. YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.
Hey.
Hey. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS JUST, UM, UPSTAIRS HELPING YOUR MOM
get READY FOR HER DATE WITH ISAAC.
cool.
Yeah.
And?
JUIN, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
that YOU'RE STILL DATING LENA?
sorry I FORGOT TO SEND OUT THE MEMO.
no, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE, LIKE,
don't YOU CARE THAT SHE SLEPT WITH TOMMY? I MEAN
it WAS A MISTAKE, OKAY?
Really? BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE DO SOMETHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
that's NOT REALLY A MISTAKE.
that's--that's MORE OF A HOBBY OR
or--or WHAT? AN ADDICTION, RIGHT?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT BUT, YOU KNOW, NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
there ARE SOME GLARING SIMILARITIES.
look, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. - IS IT?
because IT SEEMS PRETTY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE,
what YOU'RE DOING. I ME, YOU'RE ...
you're TEARING YOUR FAMILY APART. LIKE, WHY IS IT A SECRET?
why WON'T YOU JUST TELL EVERYONE?
I DON'T NEED THIS. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME DATING LENA,
that's EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. IT'S YOUR PROBLEM, OKAY?
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
the BOTTOM LINE IS YOU'RE HURTING PEOPLE, JUSTIN,
and YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.
uh, I'M FEELING A LITTLE ENTOURAGE-DEFICIENT.
I'll TRY NOT TO TAKE THAT COMMENT PERSONALLY.
which ONE'S THE TRANSLATOR?
you're THE TRANSLATOR?
you're AT MY MERCY, AREN'T YOU?
ten STORES. TEN STORES.
Hey, I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN. TODAY WAS PRETTY AWKWARD.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.
everything's FINE. THANKS.
look, UH,
I KNOW THAT IT ISN'T EASY WITH ME BEING HERE.
and JULIA DIDN'T SEEM HAPPY.
no. NO, SHE'S NOT.
well, I'M SORRY.
don't BE. IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
but... JUSTIN IS.
is THAT YOUR WAY OF ASKING ME ABOUT HIM?
Yeah.
I JUST--I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING.
join THE CLUB.
I MEAN, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE JULIA AND I ARE GOING EITHER.
you KNOW, IT'S ACTUALLY EASIER TO TALK TO YOU THAN HER RIGHT NOW.
Yeah, WELL, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN EASY WITH US.
Yeah.
whoa. WHOA. UH, WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
no, WAIT. I-I JUST-- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID,
but I-I-I LOVE JULIA.
I'm SORRY.
no, IT'S, UH...
is ROBERT GONNA TAKE CALIFORNIA?
well, HE HAS THE HOME STATE ADVANTAGE.
and NOW WITH THIS GULF SCANDAL BEHIND HIM, HIS NUMBERS ARE UP.
you REALLY THINK HE'S GONNA WIN.
well, I NEVER CALL A RACE BEFORE IT'S OVER.
Mmm. GOOD, THANK YOU.
you TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS.
it's SOUTH AFRICAN AND SURPRISING.
I DON'T CH LIKE SURPRISES.
well, I THINK YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE.
Wow.
that's WONDERFUL.
have YOU EVER BEEN TO SOUTH AFRICA?
no, HAVE YOU?
Oh, ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO, BEFORE MY WIFE CLAIRE GOT SICK,
I TOOK THE WHOLE FAMILY.
well, I WENT TO WEST AFRICA TO EXPLORE MY ANCESTRY.
we WENT TO MALI AND TO CAR SENEGAL
and THE GAMBIA.
it WAS QUITE A TRIP.
Really?
if I WERE TO EXPLORE MY ANCESTRY, I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D GO.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I COME FROM.
I'm A LITTLE OF THIS AND A LITTLE OF THAT.
I'm...
I'm A MUTT.
well, I'D SAY YOU'RE A VERY WELL-PUT-TOGETHER MUTT.
so WHAT, YOU JUST WANTED COMPANY ON THE PLANE?
trust ME, YOUR BEING HERE IS CRUCIAL TO US GETTING THIS DEAL.
how? ALL I DID WAS NOD.
I WOULD VE LIKED THE CHANCE TO PRESENT.
well, YOU DIDN'T SEE MR. LAO TALKING, DID YOU? HUH?
it MAKES YOU SEEM MORE POWERFUL IF YOU LET YOUR MINIONS SPEAK FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.
Ah. - IF I HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT A HUNDRED STORES, I SWEAR
Sarah, TRUST ME.
miss WALKER. - MM.
we ARE VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR PROPOSAL.
thank YOU.
in HOW MANY STORES?
well, MR. FINCH MAKES A VERY STRONG CASE.
we WOULD LIKE TO START WITH OUR TEN FLAGSHIP STORES.
thank YOU, MR. LAO.
that IS VERY GOOD NEWS.
Ah, PLEASE FORGIVE ME, - BUT I HAVE AN EARLY FLIGHT TOMORROW. - OF COURSE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO DOING BUSINESS,
and I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY
every SUCCESS IN THE COMING YEAR.
bye
thank YOU VERY MUCH.
my FAMILY?
well, I MAY HAVE ACCIDENTALLY LET SLIP
that YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW IS ABOUT TO BECOME PRESIDENT.
you DIDN'T!
tell ME OFF LATER OVER A DRINK, OKAY?
so, JASON, WHERE EXACTLY WERE YOU IN MALAYSIA?
were YOU--WERE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE?
well, I WAS JUST OUTSIDE OF KOTA KINABALU.
KOTA... KIN... - KINABALU.
Yeah, IT WAS-- IT WAS VERY JUNGLY.
Wow.
must HAVE BEEN HARD BEING SO FAR AWAY FROM YOUR HOME.
it WAS ISOLATING, YEAH.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SO ENGROSSED IN YOUR WORK,
you WOULDN'T HAVE TIME FOR THOUGHTS LIKE THAT.
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE THAT WAY,
but, UH, YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS, I JUST WANTED TO COME HOME.
I FELT LIKE THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME I WENT TO SUMMER CAMP.
I THINK I CALLED HOME TWICE A DAY.
calling HOME WASN'T REALLY AOPTION FOR ME.
why NOT? NO CELL PHONE COVERAGE?
I WAS HAVING A CRISIS OF FAITH, ACTUALLY.
Really? I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. OH, BUT THEN, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.
I'm--I'm SORRY. I WAS SPENDING MY TIME TALKING TO GOD.
at LEAST YOU WERE TALKIN' TO SOMEONE.
and YOU DON'T NEED A CELL PHONE TO TALK TO GOD, RIGHT?
I'm GONNA GO TO THE KITCHEN. CAN I GET ANYBODY ANYTHING?
why DON'T YOU JUST DROP THE HOSTESS ACT?
okay.
you GUYS HAD THINGS TO RESOLVE. IT'S OBVIOUS.
so WHY BRING HOME CRUSTACEANS?
I-I'd LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK WE HAVE TO RESOLVE.
I HAVE NOTHING TO RESOLVE.
he KEEPS SAYING THAT.
no, NO, IT'S QUITE SPLE, HONESTLY
we WERE TOGETHER, HE WENT TO MALAYSIA,
I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN, END OF STORY.
Oh, REALLY? OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE PART WHERE YOU PROMISED TO WAIT FOR ME AND THEN BROKE UP WITH ME ON THE PHONE?
I'm SURPRISED YOU PICKED UP THE PHONE.
you WANT TO KNOW WHY I DIDN'T CALL? - WHY?
I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE IT WORSE.
worse? - I MISSED YOU TOO MUCH, OKAY?
I-I THOUGHT IF I COULD JUST FOCUS ON WHERE I WAS - AND WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO-- - YOU KNOW-- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?
that's THE WORST EXCUSE I'VE EVER HEARD.
you MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE WERE THROUGH, OVER,
like IAS SOME MATERIALISTIC GUY YOU HAD NO TIME FOR.
and YOU GUYS HAVE NOTHING TO RESOLVE. RIGHT.
stay OUT OF THIS FOR ONE MINUTE.
no. WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK HIM WHY HE CAME HOME?
I'm SURE YOU WANT TO KNOW.
well, IT WASN'T FOR HIM, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
he DUMPED ME. THAT'S WHEN I FOUND MY SPIRITUAL STRENGTH
finally. - SO GOD WON AFTER ALL.
Yes, KEVIN. IN A CONTEST BETWEEN YOU AND GOD, GOD WON.
great. SO EVERYTHING WORKED OUT FOR THE BEST.
Yeah, PERFECT.
well, I'M REALLY GLADE WE HAD THAT TALK.
Hey.
Hi.
what IS THIS STUFF?
you SAID YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM,
so I THOUGHT I'D ANSWER THEM.
that's HIS YEARBOOK PICTURE...
pictures FROM PROM, LETTERS FROM HIGH SCHOOL, EVERYTHING.
and WHAT ABOUT YOU AND LENA? WHEN DID YOU SLEEP WITH HER?
I TOLD YOU.
it WAS A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER YOU LEFT, AND, UH,
you ACCUSED ME OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR WILLIAM'S DEATH.
you REMEMBER THAT?
so WHILE YOU WERE OFF DEALING WITH YOUR EMOTIONS,
how DID--HOW DID YOU JUST HOOK UP WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND?
I WAS DEALING WITH MY EMOTIONS.
I WAS ALSO BORED AND LONELY, AND I RAN INTO SOMEONE I KNEW,
and WE HAD A COUPLE DRINKS, AND--AND I GOT HAMMERED!
what ABOUT YOU AND LENA? WERE YOU DRUNK?
Yeah, THE FIRST TIME.
the FIRST TIME? SO WERE YOU SOBER THE SECOND, THIRD
you WENT AWAY, ALL RIGHT? GONE! NOTHING!
you THINK THAT GIVES YOU A RIGHT TO CHEAT?
well, WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?
I'll GET HER.
no, TOMMY.
we've GOT TO FIGURE THIS OUT...
for HER.
I KNOW.
I KNOW I OWE YOU TWO WEEKS NOTICE
and THAT I'M NOT BEING PROFESSIONAL OR WHATEVER,
but I JUST-- I CAN'T BE HERE ANYMORE.
did SOMETHING HAPPEN?
listen, I'M NOT GONNA SUE OR ANYTHING,
if THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.
what MADE YOU DECIDE TO DO THIS NOW?
I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE WITH TOMMY...
but CLEARLY...
I'm SCREWED UP.
when I WAS WITH WILLIAM,
I THOUGHT, THIS ISN'T PERFECT,
it's A COMPROMISE, BUT IT'S MY CHOICE.
I EVEN THOUGHT THAT I WAS IN CONTROL.
and FOR 20 YEARS,
I LET THAT IDEA AND THAT MAN DICTATE WHO I WAS.
when I FINALLY REALIZED THAT I WAS JUST FILLING IN THE GAP FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S RELATIONSHIP, IT WAS TOO LATE,
and I COULDN'T LEAVE.
it IS BETTER IF YOU FIGURE THIS OUT NOW.
I HOPE SO.
use THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S YOURS.
okay, MAKE IT FOR 10: 00, AND THEN CHANGE THE 2: 00.
all RIGHT. OKAY.
I'm--I'm SORRY.
that's OKAY.
how ARE YOU, NORA?
um... WELL, I'VE HARDLY SEEN JUSTIN ALL WEEK,
but YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT
Tommy AND JULIA HAVE SAID THAT THEY REALLY, TRULY HAVE
I ASKED, HOW ARE YOU?
not YOUR KIDS.
Oh.
how I am I
I HAVE NO IDEA.
uh, TRAVIS?
I'm NOT GONNA DEAL WITH THAT RIGHT NOW,
don't CALL BACK.
I'm DEALING WITH SOMETHING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
you UNDERSTAND?
I'm SORRY.
that's OKAY.
you're RIGHT. THIS WINE IS SURPRISING...
a VERY NICE SURPRISE.
he's ERTAINLY T BEST-LOOKG CANDIDATE WE'VE EVER HAD.
Yeah, NOT TO MENTION HE'D MAKE A DAMN FINE PRESIDENT.
to SENATOR McCALLISTER AND HIS UNWITTING ASSIST IN TODAY'S VICTORY.
I SUPPOSE IF MY SISTER HAS TO MARRY A REPUBLICAN,
I SHOULD BENEFIT IN SOME FASHION.
well, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE JUST GONNA END UP BEING SO RICH THAT,
uh, YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO BECOME A REPUBLICAN YOURSELF.
that's A DEPRESSING THOUGHT.
okay, SO WHAT HAPPENS
if ROBERT DOESN'T MAKE IT TO THE WHITE HOUSE?
well, THAT CONNECTN JUST GOT US IN THE DOOR.
by ELECTION DAY, THEY'RE GONNA BE SO IMPRESSED BY OJAI FOODS AND BY YOU, IT'S... IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER
well, I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. - OH, YEAH.
to GOLDEN PLUM. - AND ITS TEN FLAGSHIP STORES.
so NOW YOU DON'T WANT McCALLISTER TO WIN? WHY IS THAT?
wrong PARTY,
though I SUPPOSE IT'D BE FUN YOU NEED A DATE?
I'm WEIGHING MY OPTIONS.
Oh, DAMNOH, OW,
I'm AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO ON OPTION-WEIGHING BECAUSE,
uh, I GOT A LATE DINNER.
what HAPPENED TO OUR FUN NIGHT OUT IN SAN FRANCISCO?
uh...
I'm--I'm SORRY, BUT I-I REALLY THOUGHT
our NIGHT OUT WAS OFF THE TABLE.

Oh, NOT AT ALL. UH, YVONNE CALO, THIS IS SARAH WALKER.
Hi. -I' M ACTUALLY DOING, UH, WORK FOR HER COMPANY AT THE MOMENT.

I GOT OUT OF WORK EARLY.
no, NO, NO. YOU MADE SURE YOU GOT OUT OF WORK EARLY.
okay, FINE. WELL, ACTUALLY, NOW I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
well, I'M GLAD YOU DO BECAUSE I DON'T.
exactly. YOU DON'T KNOW.
you DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME, ABOUT HIM, ABOUT ANYTHING.
if YOU DID, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CHOOSE, REALLY CHOOSE,
instead OF... INSTEAD OF PRETENDING.
is THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING, PRETENDING?
you TELL ME.
because I DON'T FEEL LIKE I LIVE HERE.
I STAY HERE BECAUSE YOU LET ME. - OHH.
do YOU REALIZE THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS APARTMENT THAT'S MINE EXCEPT CLOTHES?
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, SCOTTY?
be HONEST WITH ME.
if YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH JASON McCALLISTER
no, I AM NOT IN LOVE WITH JASON McCALLISTER.
why DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO JEALOUS?
because IF YOU COULD SEE THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER
if YOU DON'T TRUST ME, LEAVE.
fine.
Oh, GOD. WHERE ARE YOU?
I'm LEAVING. ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
Yeah, IT IS. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.
Hey.
Hey.
Where's, UH, WHERE'S MOM?
uh, I DON'T KNOW. THINK SHE'S OUT WITH ISAAC.
mind IF I JOIN YOU?
Yeah, WHATEVER.
listen, I... I KNOW IT HASN'T BEEN EASY BETWEEN US,
and WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN HONEST WITH EACH OTHER,
and YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA WANT TO KILL ME.
but, UM...
Lena TRIED TO KISS ME.
I KNOW.
you DO?
Yeah, SHE TOLD ME THE WHOLTHY.
look, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I
I KNOW. SHE SAID IT WAS HER FAULT, YOU KNOW.
it's FINE. WE BROKE UP ANYWAY.
??? Are you ok?
not REALLY, BUT ...
I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.
turns OUT IF YOU WANT TO ESCAPE REALITY,
sex IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS PILLS.
tell ME ABOUT IT.
I'm SORRY, MAN.
me, TOO.
you KNOW, SOMETIMES IT REALLY SUCKS WE CAN'T HAVE A BEER TOGETHER.
well, WE CAN. YOU JUST HAVE TO DRINK IT.
go AWAY. I'M BUSY.
would YOU PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR?
no.
Scotty, OPEN THE DOOR.
wow, I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE.
Yeah, WELL, AT LEAST IT'S MINE.
I'm SORRY.
no, I... SHOULDN'T HAVE BARGED IN ON YOUR TEA PARTY.
Yeah, ENOUGH WITH THE SHELLFISH NOW.
but YOU KNOW WHAT? WHEN YOU WALKED IN, I WAS SECRETLY SO PROUD.
of WHAT?
of YOU,
of HOW GENUINE YOU ARE AND HOW CRAZY AND HONEST AND
jealous.
Mm...
so HOW DO I MAKE THIS BETTER?
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE HIM ANYMORE.
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO HIM AT FAMILY STUFF.
Yeah.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU MAKING PLANS WITH HIM.
okay.
promise.
Really?
I DON'T THINK YOU GET HOW MUCH I WANT US TO BE TOGETHER.
God, NOW I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT FOR ASKING.
Why?
it ONLY MAKES ME WANT TO HAVE YOU .
you KNOW WHAT? I-I ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO GO TO WORK,
and I DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT GETTING BUSY IN A 1970s RANCHERO...
okay. - BEAUTIFUL AS IT IS.
I'll SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME?
okay.
so, UH, LENA QUIT LAST NIGHT.
did YOU ASK HER TO?
no. HOLLY SAID IT WAS HER DECISION.
I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS.
Hey, COME ON, THIS IS A GOOD THING.
she's NOT THE PROBLEM. WE ARE.
I THINK WE NEED TO SEE SOMEONE.
and I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO ASK FOR HELP,
and I KNOW THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
is TALK TO SOME STRANGER ABOUT OUR PERSONAL LIVES, BUT...
Yes.
whatever IT TAKES, WE'LL DO IT.
thank YOU.
hey THERE.
Mr. FINCH. MISSED YOU ON THE PLANE THIS MORNING.
I HOPE YVETTE MADE YOU A NICE BREAKFAST.
actually, IT'S YVONNE. - OH.
and, UH, WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME IF I TOLD YOU SHE JUST WANTED INVESTMENT ADVICE,AND I LEFT HER AT A PERFECTLY REASONABLE HOUR?
not SO MUCH.
okay. UH,
I DID ADVISE HER TO INVEST IN A WORKING ALARM CLOCK, THOUGH.
listen, UH, YOU WERE RIGHT YESTERDAY.
I'd HAVE SCARED THEM OFF.
well, YOU'RE THE REASON WE WERE THERE, SO THANK YOU.
my PLEASURE.
and I STILL OWE YOU A FUN NIGHT OUT.
don't HOLD YOUR BREATH.
okay.
Hello?
Oh, hey, I heard that dinner went really well.
you DID? - Mm-hmm
you TALKED TO HIM? ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID HE SAY?
Oh, WELL, THAT'S PRIVILEGE CAMPAIGN INFORMATION, MOTHER.
sorry. - Kitty!
okay, HE--HE SEEMED VERY HAPPY, SMITTEN, EVEN.
smitten, EVEN?
he did. HE JUST--HE--HE SAID THAT HE HAD A GREAT TIME.
he DID? - MM-HMM.
you KNOW WHAT? - What?
we HAD A REALLY GREAT TIME.
okay. OKAY. JUST REMEMBER, MOM.
remember what you always used to say to me.
yeah? - YOU JUST TAKE IT SLOW.
you MAKE HIM WAIT.
remember THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE?
I'd JUST FOUND OUT YOU EXISTED.
Yeah, YOU WERE, KE, THE ONLY ONE IN YOUR FAMILY
that WAS ACTUALLY TALKING TO ME.
it's CRAZY, HUH?
Yeah, NOW YOU'RE, LIKE, THE ONLY ONE THAT'S NOT TALKING TO ME.
look, REBECCA, I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY.
like YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT LENA AND ABOUT EVERYTHING.
say IT.
what?
you KNOW WHAT.
I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING.
told YOU SO. - I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT.
I'm not gonna deal with that right now, so don't call back.
I'm dealing with something extremely important.
be careful of this one.
he'll make you a ton of money, and then you'll never want to let him go.
that's right.
I was in love with a man.
why didn't you tell me?
ten years ago, you outed my brother.
it devastated him.
any idealism I had was completely obliterated by what you did.
I don't trust you, david.
you still haven't told me why you suddenly appear at my house and my place of business.
mom, there's no way that.
I mean, he couldn't.
Oh, god, no.
william walker was your father.
how's the hollandaise sauce coming?
almost done.
let me taste it.
Oh, sweetheart, that's fabulous.
you're turning into a really good cook.
well, you did all the cooking.
I just whisked. You know what?
I'm gonna ask Kevin to talk to Scoy about getting you in as a trainee at the restaurant.
Oh, god, not you, too.
you sound like my mom.
she's all over me about finding a direction.
apparently, everybody thinks I'm an aimless loser.
Hey, aimless loser is my job.
speaking of jobs, I talking about her.
you know what? Photography.
you were carrying around that camera with you all last summer.
but that's not a job.
that's, like, a hobby.
photography can be a job.
know what? This is delicious.
maybe I should just stick to whisking.
well, you better be careful.
you don't want to whisk your life.
with the michigan primary only a week, following an onslaught of attack ads airing in Michigan this past week, congressman Taylor has pulled to within a single percentage point of the California senator.
how- how did we not see this coming?
I mean, Taylor just pulled up out of nowhere, and he goes from zero to 90 in-- in less than 2 weeks?
we took a risk-- you know, lay low, let the other guys pick each other off, and then go after the ones who are remaining standing.
that's how he stole Iowa right out from underneath us.
wait a minute. Let's not forget that we did win Wyoming, which is a very good indication that we are gonna take the west.
we just need to trust our strategy.
Really?
because you all told me to focus on Adamson and Burgess-- ignore the rest of 'em, those were the two to pay attention to--and then Taylor ambushes us in iowa.
we also advised you to reveal the truth about Adamson, and you didn't, which gave Taylor the opportunity to reveal it on his own schedule.
and even worse, it let Taylor see what kind of campaign you're running.
and what kind of campaign is that?
Robert, taking the high road doesn't always get you where you want to go.
if anybody has any qualms about the way I'm running this campaign.
wait a minute, Robert. - Remember that I'm the candidate.
nobody has any qualms.
we're just all very stressed out.
now what we need to do is, we need to change the itinerary.
michigan's primary is next week, and we just need to focus all of our efforts right there.
no, I already scheduled a huge rally in New York.
well, reschedule. Taylor is making a big push in Michigan, and I say that we have to push back.
we need to go into Super Tuesday strong, not playing catch-up.
and don't forget governor Bryant is going to endorse Robert, and we could have a really nice press conference.
well, Bryant is certainly taking his time.
uh, you sure you can count on him?
Yeah, I've known Michael since boot camp.
if he says he's gonna endorse, he's gonna endorse.
Travis, tell the staff we're going to Michigan, all right?
we're traveling.
I'll postpone my trip to California, oversee the new initiative.
we just have to keep the faith.
you sound like Jason.
he always told me until the last votes are cast, that I needed to hold on to my faith.
well, Jason happens to be a very, very wise man.
did you know that I haven't even seen him since he's been back?
I haven't seen my kids since the wedding.
I probably wouldn't even see you if you didn't work for me.
all right, I gotta go pack.
I'm so over it.
it's like, the nicer the car, the smaller thtip.
mario is a valet at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
I-I-I love that place.
I take a lot of clients to the Polo Lounge.
how can you even breathe in that place?
so many stuffed shirts.
well, where do you want him to go?
he's a lawyer, Jordan.
they--they actually do a-a great burger.
gentlemen!
Q. You made it.
um, Quinn, this is Kevin.
Oh, the infamous Kevin.
Quinn is one of the promors here.
we're doing karaoke night tomorrow.
it is gonna be off the chain.
all right, you know what? I'm--I'm not actually a-a karaoke type.
good morning.
morning.
do you mind if I...
uh, go right ahead.
Ibuprofen's my favorite.
did you just take four?
I was trying to, uh, keep with the, uh, these crazy kids from Singapore last night.
man, these venture capitalists can drink.
they bought themselves a start-up airline, and they've been thinking about providing healthier meals.
and I thought, well, there might be something in it for Ojai.
are you serious?
what? That's why you brought me on, right?
help explore new business possibilities, right?
Yes, and if th have anything to do with ojai or the future of ojai, I would appreciate an invite.
Oh, sarah, come on.
listen, these-- these guys are savages.
the heavy drinking is not optional, and the entertainment is.
you're far too respectable.
how many strip joints did you go to, exactly?
thank you.
Oh, it's-- it's just my divorce papers are finally ready for me to sign.
well, th-that's fairly significant.
It's's not exactly unexpected.
all right.
I'm here if you need me.
Oh, look, I'm stuffing my shirt.
okay, I know my friends weren't the warmest last night.
I should have worn a parka.
they were just being protective.
from what? Me?
you have to admit, our history has been a little bit checkered.
I'm not solely responsible for the checkering, okay?
you tell 'em any of the good stuff?
Yes. They just happen to remember the other stuff.
They--they'll warm up to you. You're different.
they're more bohemian.
come on, admit it. They just think I'm boring.
no, they just think you're.
I am not uptight.
okay. Whatever you need to tell yourself.
okay, fine. I'll see you after my long, uptight day at work.
at least they think you're cute.
5: 50 A. M. Waffle emporium.
construction, trucking and shift workers make up the early morning breakfast crowd.
Hey, where's Kitty?
she should be here by now.
she told me she had something to do.
I get very nervous when Kitty's vague.
so after breakfast, we head out to the Dearborn fair, and then we're gonna go to the Saginaw wildlife field office for a Q&A with a hunters group.
Hey, maybe we can do a photo -- you know, you, rifle in one hand, deer or...
it's--it's too late.
it's small game season.
squirrels, bobtail rabbits.
Yeah, it's not very manly to kill thumper.
any luck with scheduling a meeting with the governor?
Oh, his office is checking into available times, or so they claim.
you know what? I'm gonna call him personally.
Finally!
what was so important?
daddy!
Oh, what a great surprise!
wait a minute.
there's--There's more.
not a bad idea, huh?
what?
Kitty, remember his brother being outed during Robert's first campaign?
yeah?
th-- that was you?
all right, if I get this one, Robert's gonna take Michigan.
and if I make this one, it confirms that tossing rings can't predict the future.
all right, I'll stop.
good idea to bring the kids.
robert seems more relaxed than he's been for a while.
so when are you headed back to california?
Ah, in couple of days.
well, good,'cause we need you coordinating the Super Tuesday push, and--and I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be here when jason's here.
robert and I have come to terms with it.
good.
are-- are you having a good time?
my head hurts.
Oh, no.
I don't think they're feeling well.
maybe have a fever or something.
maybe we should pick up some Aspirin on the way to your next appointment, which we are already 20 minutes late for.
why don't I just take them back to the hotel?
you know what. Kitty? I'll go with you.
great. Excellent.
okay, guys, I'll see you back there.
I love you, daddy.
and I'll get you some hot chocolate.
I was very surprised that you had time for lunch.
Why?
I always have time for you, Saul.
and then a lot of my family and loved ones are not even in the state, so.
you mean Isaac?
I remember when you first started dating william, I didn't see you for many months.
Really?
isaac is very busy, and so we have to take it very slow.
I see.
why are you smiling?
I just thought how much fun it would be to tell mother about your new boyfriend.
I really don't care what anyone thinks.
I only care what I think and what Isaac thinks.
and you know what?
what?
I have a family who loves me, and they're happy when I'm happy.
so this is no longer about you and Isaac. Right?
no, Saul, it isn't.
I am your sister.
I love you in a very nonjudgmental way.
if there's ever anything you want to talk to me about.
I want to tell you that you are my little sister, and I do love you, and I want you to have your lunch.
Hey, David.
Hey, come on in.
did you bring your camera?
Yeah, I have it, and thank you so much.
I'm really excited to go out.
please. My social calendar is humiliatingly empty.
you're doing me a favor.
so what's the sudden interest in photography?
you trying to avoid getting a real job?
something like that.
look at this.
it's probably older than you are.
1998. Well, that was a good year.
so when did you get into photography?
who cares?
come on, let's go.
where are we going?
we're gonna go take some pictures.
let me see your camera.
first lesson--you always take it off automatic.
you only shoot manual.
trust me. It's gonna change the way you see things.
cool.
and that's just meant to be okay, that you're taking Paula?
look, fine.
do you think I'm uptight?
Yes.
W-why?'Cause I wear a suit?
come on, Kevin.
I'm not in the mood for one of your neurotic freak-outs.
what's wrong with you?
Joe is taking Paula to paris for her birthday.
so?
so I told joe that i wanted to be whisked off to Paris for my birthday.
well, she stole my present.
or he stole it and gave it to her.
did you get the divorce papers I sent you?
don't change the subject.
did you sign them?
I will.
later.
I've been busy.
should go out. - No.
you're uptight.
I'm not going to paris.
this deserves an outing.
you and me, tonight.
we can commiserate.
I don't need to commiserate.
then watch me commiserate with a bottle of tequila.
you don't need a brother. You need to get lucky.
Oh, come on. It's not my senior prom.
I just--I want to go out, let my hair down and get savage.
okay, now you're scaring me.
that's because you're uptight.
I am.
come on, Kevin. We're walkers.
let's go do what walkers do best.
get drunk?
okay.
but I get to pick the place.
you are all over the local news.
take that, Boyd Taylor!
you know what? We are winning this thing.
we are gonna kill him in Michigan, and then we're gonna drag his bloody carcass through every primary state till there's nothing left but a mangled flag lapel pin.
I gotta hand it to Kitty.
bringing the kids was a stroke of genius, walking petri dishes that they are.
Oh, and are they feeng better?
I spoke to the governor.
he'll see me tonight, late.
Oh, under cover of darkness. Interesting.
kid update-- fevers are dropping.
noses are running. Just your run-of-the-mill flu.
how's kitty holding up?
good now that the cold medicine's kicking in and the kids are getting drowsy.
you know what? I'm gonna catch a couple hours sleep myself.
wear a face mask.
Hey, put jason to work.
whatever you need.
Yeah, okay.
women's baptist group?
easy.
all I need is the collar, the smile.
you know, last time I campaigned for Robert, I learned how to quilt.
Yeah, but this is the midwest, not california.
you know what? I'm gonna be blunt.
if you want Robert to win, you're gonna have to lay low.
want to run that advice by Robert?
Oh, believe me, he doesn't want to know.
but he's willing to make concessions to win, like hiring Isaac.
I'm surprised you're being such a good supporter about it.
why wouldn't I be?
you've really got this whole forgiveness thing down, don't you?
I'd want to kill the man who outed me.
isaac outed me?
now that is a photo.
they are just like these-- these little angels.
well, the demons only appear during waking hours.
my, um, my allergies are acting up.
Hey, I can get us a sitter service if you want.
no, no. I don't want to dump 'em with a sitter.
I like being their stepmom.
Hey, you don't mind if I get some sleep in the other room, do you?
uh, no. No, no.
I don't-- I don't want you to get sick.
but you could always come visit me.
what?
Yeah, you are just burning up.
no, I'm not. I'm totally fine.
I'm just achy and tired from all the travel, and my allergies are starting to act up because we're in a new place, and my voice is scratchy because I talk. a lot.
and I'- I've caught their flu.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here you go, sweetie.
Oh, thanks. These movies are stupid.
wait, "pirates." I want to watch "pirates."
No! I don't want to watch that.
I don't care!
Hey, guys, you guys, let's just take turns, okay?
just watch something, anything.
no, no!
you said we could pick anything.
Yeah, I meant anything that was age-appropriate.
now--now that-- that show is for grown-ups.
it's for grown-ups who love each other and love to watch other grown-ups who love each other.
never mind.
Oh, look, cartoons.
that'll cancel out what you just saw.
no, wait a minute. I'm taking the remote.
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'm going to get some medicine, and I will be right back.
okay?
Hello?
Hey, mom.
sweetheart, you sound terrible.
Oh, I know, I know.
I'm sick.
well, drink lots of water and get into bed.
I-I am.
it just that, you know, the kids are sick, too, and they're not letting me get any sleep, and you know what?
I don't know how to make them feel better.
and didn't you tell me once that grandma gave you some brandy or something?
Yes, but that was a different era, and she was a terrible mother.
right, she was.
okay, fine. So I can't do that.
Where's robert?
everyone is out campaigning.
I know Isaac is.
I only got to talk to him for ten minutes today.
mom, please.
I don't want to talk about Isaac.
I just want to talk about me.
Kitty, do you remember when you had the chicken pox?
Yes.
you made me chicken soup, and you put cold compresses on my head, and you rubbed calamine lotion all over my body.
Yes, but what you don't remember is when you had the chicken pox, Sarah had the chicken pox, and Tommy had the chicken pox, and Kevin had the chicken pox.
and I had a very bad cold.
your dad was out of town on business.
sweetheart, I'm saying this to you with as much love as I possibly can.
sometimes motherhood means sucking it up.
Kitty, go suck it up.
Oh, great.
well, thank you, mom.
good night, sweetheart.
I'm sorry. I was expecting milo.
Milo's out of town for a few weeks.
italy, the lucky dog.
well, would you tell him that I stopped by, please?
my name is Saul.
you're Saul.
Yeah, I'm--I'm Saul.
Milo told me about you.
I'm Evan, by the way.
Milo's just letting me stay here while he's gone.
nice to meet you.
likewise.
well, why don't you come in for a minute, and I'll get you the number of the hotel where he's staying?
apparently, he managed to drown his cell phone in the Trevi Fountain.
did he? That's funny.
no, you know what, Evan?
I don't want to trouble you.
no, no, it's no trouble.
just give me a second to sort through the rubble that is my life.
come on in.
pour yourself some wine.
these are pretty cool.
Yeah, that's Joshua tree.
that would have been, uh, during my peyote period, which was, um,1979, according to this.
Yeah. God, I'm old.
drugs are bad.
you know that, right?
Yes, I do.
look at this-- you and my mom.
that one's 1985.
that was the last hurrah, huh?
Oh, I guess.
the 80s are pretty much a haze for me.
Oh, my god, look.
she looks beautiful.
Yeah, well.
I can't take credit for this one, though.
what, you didn't take it?
Oh, I took it.
I just--you know, trained monkeys couldn't mess up a picture of her.
you want it?
I can have it? - Yeah.
Thanks.
I deleted all the bad ones.
how many are left?

what? I took over 100.
Hey, come on. Two good pictures for one day of shooting?
that's great.
Oh, god, I'm just starving.
Hey, you want to take a ride?
I've got the driver taking me to the governor's mansion.
I thought we could look at the Lansing skyline.
maybe you could prep me.
I know about Isaac.
and you still put him on your payroll?
that was a long time ago.
no, no, no. You brking my rock'em sock'em robots, okay, that was a long time ago.
me being outed in the local paper when I was barely 20, that's damn recent.
this is something that we should talk about, but right now it's inconvenient. Is that right?
unlike when you're campaigning in the bay area, when-- when having a gay brother is the thing you're most proud of.
I have been complely consistent with you.
I have never hidden or lied about your sexuality.
I couldn't care less whether you're gay.
would it be easier for me if you weren't?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry I can't make it any easier for you.
I have to go meet the governor.
great. Go.
two patrons, please.
you got it.
are we're doing shots?
we are having fun.
to hell with Joe.
Paris, it's such a cliche anyway.
what are you looking at?
what?
Hey, isn't that Scotty?
where?
it is Scotty. Let's go say hi.
no. No, he--he'll come to us.
this is one of those "I'll prove them wrong" nights.
I got it. Got you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm just here to have fun with my big sister.
that's him over there.
Uh-oh, we've been spotted.
Oh, my god.
quick, have fun.
Sarah, hi.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Yeah, we're just having fun.
Sarah wanted a night out, and she loves karaoke, so fanatical. - Perfect.
actually, Kevin and I, we're gonna do.
a big duet.
Really?
no. - Yup.
well, I'm glad that's settled.
I-I would, but my-my-my throat's a little sore, so.
liar. - Traitor.
well, you guys are welcome to come and join us.
you know we will.
later.
great, now he wants me to sing.
Oh, you're singing, baby.
do you have any idea how stupid people look when they sing karaoke?
two more patrons, please.
God, you are so uptight!
do you want scotty's friends to know what a warm, caring, fun guy kevin walker is?
Yes.
then drink up and get stupid with me.
so when are we gonna meet the new Mrs. Mccallister?
soon as you come to one of our events.
this week has been hell.
tell me about it.
Hey, look at you.
you might win this thing.
you know, your endorsement could really make that happen.
Taylor has a reputation of holding a grudge.
if he wins, it's my state.
it's my political future on the line.
Taylor has some serious momentum.
Oh, come on.
I campaigned for you.
and I'm grateful.
and look, this isn't personal.
it is to me.
you have my vote, but a public endorsement, I can't.
you should have told me sooner.
how about Dolly Parton?
you love her.
no, I don't.
remember in high school, you said she had the only pair of breasts you ever noticed.
9 to 5!
no, no, Scotty's friends think I'm obsessed with work.
something less corporate.
okay. Freebird.
Yeah, what are we supposed to do for a 3-minute guitar solo, dance?
I don't care. No, we get up, we express ourselves.
come on.
this is our chance.
Oh, no, no, no! - What?
I'm not ready. What are you doing?
I'm singing!
no, we're supposed to sing!
we can't even decide on a song.
I hate you!
Oh, go get drunk.
okay, then make me believe, because I can't even bring myself to sign my divorce papers.
what man in his right and would divorce you?
okay, I love your friends.
Oh, the feeling is definitely mutual.
okay, so my soon-to-be ex is about to vacate to Paris
Vacate?
with his new girlfriend, who happens to be his first wife.
shut up.
you need to sign those divorce papers and move on.
where are they now?
they're, um, in the office.
so get someone to bring 'em here.
what, now? I can't do that.
you see this?
it's a little thing called a cell phone.
get those papers and sign them now.
no, I can't.
come on.
do it.
I'll do it.
Graham! It's Sarah. What are you doing there?
I can barely hear you. You at a concert or something?
no, I'm in a bar.
are you drunk-dialing me?
no. Listen, the thing is, I need my divorce papers.
could you have somebody bring them over to me?
they're in the top, right-hand drawer of my desk.
Yeah, well, uh, what's the rush?
graham, please, can you, just for once, do what I ask you, please?
okay, where are you?
I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago, and I needed interim housing, so.
I'm eeping in Milo's spare room and drinking through his wine supply.
how long have you known him?
not as long as you have, but, uh, a group of us his friends-- helped him through his divorce.
his ex assumed we were the other women.
well, she was wrong. - yeah, the famous Elaine.
well, we encouraged him to leave her, but, uh, he was horribly horribly faithful to her, right up until he moved out.
well, I guess he's making up for lost time now.
is that jealousy I hear? - no, I-I.
I didn't have that kind of relationship with Milo.
I know. He told me.
I think you broke his heart a little bit.
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.
Ohh.
this burger's dry.
I thought you were a vegetarian.
Yeah, like a million years ago. - Igotta go to the bathroom.
are you okay, jack?
a-- are these your clothes?
Yes.
mom has a dress just like this except it's bigger on top.
great.
maybe if you get pregnant, you'll get boobs.
one can only hope.
Oh, sophie, please come and rest.
Please--Jack!
what--why are you wet?
well, behind the toilet, there was this thing sticking out.
so I turned it just to see, and - eww!
toilet water is everywhere! This is disgusting!
Oh jack, Jack, wh-why did you do that?
mom says yelling's a sign of weakness.
I'm not yelling, Sophie. - I--I wish mom was here.
you know what? You guys are starting to act like those mean, spoiled little kids in that fairy tale.
remember the ones that fell into the boiling cauldron? - Well that makes you the evil stepmom.
well, right now I am the evil stepmom, and I want you to listen to me.
there is gonna be no more whining, no more complaining, no more fighting over what we're gonna watch. Now get in bed, and I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you.
do you understand me?
Hi, no.
no, sorry. Sorry. no, everything is great.
we're just--you know, we're having, um a plumbing problem.
Yeah.
Oh, my god. Is that...
is that your messenger?
he's not a messenger. He's a stuffed shirt
he doesn't seem too button-down to me.
excuse me.
graham, what are you doing here?
uh, well, I called a messenger, but he was, uh, he wasn't comfortable picking out a-- a woman in an unknown bar, but I can see that wouldn't have been that difficult.
uh, graham finch, these are my new best friends.
here you go.
do it, girl. Be strong. - Believe girl.
I will be divorced in.
three.
two.
one.
Congratulations.
way to go.
so, I'm a divorcee.
does that make me hotter?
your brother's really something.
okay, he's not uptight when he is drunk.
quite as good... - girls, I never thought I'd say this.
I don't hate him.
where are you going? - this is incredibly sweet, but I think I should probably put him out of his misery.
they like you.
I didn't get the endorsement.
it's probably your cosmic payback.
I don't want payback.
Yeah, because you're good and forgiving.
I wish I was more like you.
I feel like we're both doing the same thing.
you know, we're making compromises for a greater purpose.
is that what I'm doing?
cause, boy, I don't know.
it all just seems like a game.
attack this guy, stay away from that issue, and in the end, what do you really accomplish?
well, you didn't get into politics for money or--or power.
a lot easier ways to get that, right?
I think we were both called to serve.
thank you.
well, listen.
it could all be over in 24 hours.
you want a drink? - Hell yes oh, good. You are up.
Yeah, I have been looking through these beautiful photography books.
Where'd they come from? - David.
beautiful, aren't they?
mom, he lent me so many things.
he gave me a tripod and filters and--and a light meter.
I mean, uh, he's great.
I don't know how I feel about you seeing david, but I am thrilled you're so excited.
you know, I might actually be half good.
no, no, no, no.
I look terrible. - what? mom?
no, you don't, you look like you, which is beautiful.
could you just, like, fix some of the lights or something?
Oh, no. That must have been embarrassing.
no, no, not at all.
if the way he photographed you means anything, - He was seriously in love with you, mom. - No.
so, um, so you stopped seeing david right when you started dating william?
Becca, I was seeing William, and then finally he let me know that he was never gonna leave Nora.
so I broke it off and I tried to move on.
that's when I met david.
we had fun.
we made a few terrible movies gether.
but it ended in 1985.
I was still in love with william.
so even though he was married, that's who I wanted to be with.
so william and david never overlapped?
no, they did not.
Oh, that's enough!
well, thank you. I mean, besides your head shots, I don't really think I have any pictures of you.
Yeah, well, I want to see all of those.
Sophie, what are you doing?
I was just checking to see if you still had a fever.
I'm okay. How are you feeling?
my throat still hurts.
you know, my mom gives me ice chips to chew on.
want me to get you some?
Oh, that's really sweet, but I'm okay.
you know, I'm, um.
I'm really sorry I yelled.
I guess I get cranky when I'm sick.
Yeah, me, too.
does jack hate me?
no. He thinks you're cool.
how do you feel about getting some more sleep?
that'd be good.
I can't believe that you brought my divorce papers to a gay bar.
now don't you regret not going out with me sooner?
can I ask you something? - yeah.
do you have women in every city, or just.
California?
well, not ever city, no.
you never got married?
came close a couple times.
what stopped you?
I don'know. Too much to get into right now.
a piece of paper to signify my regret.
a woman like you? i give you...
a year, tops.
maybe I like being on the market.
you know what? - What?
no, I can't. - No, you - No, we shouldn't do it. - You cannot play the perfect gentleman right now.
you--you've been coming on to me since the day we met.
Listen--but you're-- you're drunk.
I know, but I'm a grown-up and I know what I'm doing, despite the tequila.
well, when you put it that way.
Oh, god.
let's get out of here. - yeah.
no, oh, boy.
not even gonna say good-bye, are you?
was I that bad? - No.
no, you were far from bad, I think.
so why are you sneaking out?
I'm not sneaking.
I'm just, um.
what? Why are you looking at me like that?
just... seeing you do the walk of shame.
you... you know, I've been seeing a whole new side to you lately.
no. no, here-- there's no shame.
I am--I'm gonna strut out of here.
and I'm gonna get in my car, and i'm going to drive home with pride.
Yeah, well, uh, along with your pride, you might want to take this.
I knew I should have worn the sexy one.
I wish you would have called first. I would have cleaned up.
Oh, your place looks fine.
no, I meant me.
you look fine, too.
I wanted to thank you for helping Rebecca.
here sit down. - Thanks.
and you don't have to thank me.
Rebecca's a great girl-- a young woman-- eh, whatever.
Yeah, and she's not a bad photographer, you know?
she's got potential. - I know. she showed me.
she's actually thinking about enrolling in some college courses.
Oh, that's great.
did she tell you I showed her these?
Oh, I can't believe you kept those.
Oh, Look at us.
Yeah, we were so cute?
wow - And these.
Oh, no. - Yeah.
those were the last pictures I ever took of you.
okay, you're gonna have to leave now, or I'm pretty sure I'm gonna kiss you.
okay okay--you're gonna leave, or okay, I should kiss you?
I don't know.
you're gonna leave now, aren't you?
Jack, you can't put two cards down.
Yes, I can.
d-don't look at me. I'm switizerland.
Yeah, dad, he's allowed to put down two cards if they're the same value.
well, I'm--I'm just getting completely steamrolled here.
you know, I think the precincts have probably reported by now.
no, listen, if there's some news, Travis will come running in here and tell us, I'm sure.
all right.
all right, well, I suck at this game.
I know. - You lost the last six times.
fives. And guess what? I only have two cards left.
we all know what that means. - Uhh!
you forgot to say Uno!
you didn't give me a chance to say "Uno." Uno! Uno!
all three networks just called it.
we took Michigan! - Yes! Yes!
Oh, daddy! - Awesome!
that's unbelievable - They're waiting for you downstairs.
Oh, yeah! This rocks. - This is so cool.
Yes, daddy!
way to go, daddy!
go, go, go. - That's awesome!
Bye, dad! - Bye dad.

Sarah AND I WOULD BE COPRESIDENTS.
Holly WILL ASSUME THE ROLE OF CHAIRMAN AND C. E.O.
let's ADOPT. -OH, ROBERT.
Rebecca IS NOT YOUR BIOLOGICAL SISTER.
what IF IT WAS ALL JUST A WAY TO MEET YOU?

the INITIALS OF ALL HIS CHILDREN, THE LAST ONE WAS "R.
thers ANOTHER "R," BUT IT WAS NEVER REBECCA.
it WAS A BOY, AND HIS NAME WAS RYAN.

Justin, THE BABY OF THE FAMILY, "IS A WAR VETERAN.
Kevin IS A LAWYER WHO MARRIED HIS PARTNER SCOTTY.

blah, BLAHAABLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
it GOES ON LIKE THAT FOR SIX PAGES.
I MEAN, SOME POOR WOMAN COULD SPEND HER ENTIRE LAST TRIMESTER
I DON'T THINK SHE WROTSH.
I THINK SHE GOT IT OFF THE INTERNET
at schmaltz-fest. com.
more LIKELY SHE SAT DOWN ONE NIGHT,
cracked OPEN A BOTTLE OF MERLOT
and JUST KEPT WRITING UNTIL SHE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.
maybe SHE HIRED SOMEBODY TO WRITE IT.
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA ADMIT, THIS IS LAYING IT ON PRETTY THICK.
hone WE'RE ASKING SOMEONE TO GIVE US THEIR CHILD.

Oh, HI. -WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Oh, I'M, UM, MEETING SARAH FOR LUNCH.

I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART.

we WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, UM,
uh, BRINGING ANOTHER WALKER TO LAGUNA.
Oh, OH, WHO-- WHO'S IN LAGUNA?
uh, M-MY BOSS HAS GIVEN ME THE KEYS TO HIS PLACE IN LAGUNA FOR THE WEEKEND.
well, that's nice.
but why did you come all the way over here to say that?
because we're all invited.
Wh--i mean, we're talking about that as a possibility.
a possibility. - i would love to go to laguna.
Oh, i see. Robert and i are the only ones who aren't invited, right?
no, no. everyone's invited, right, mom?
Paige and coop are gonna be thrilled.
Oh, i don't know, mom.
you know, kevin and scotty Probably want the place to themselves.
they only just got married... - well...
and they're practically newlyweds. - but wait a minute.
didn't you just drive all the way over here to invite us?
Yeah.
isn't it exciting?
your brother is on the fast track to make partner.
I am so proud of you. - yeah, anspeaking of which, i
wow, i have to get back to the office. So i'll
I'll tell scotty the good news. everyone's coming?
Yeah. - Yeah.
great.
enjoy lunch. - Bye.
call tommy from the car.
Oh, god, no, not tommy.
well, what's wrong with tommy?
I don't even know how to tell you this.
sarah-- - No, mom, what you don't know,
what nobody knows, especially kevin,
is that tommy and holly have decided to fire him.
they're gonna fire kevin?
and there is nothing i can do about it.
well, just say no.
Oh, i work for holly harper now, mom.
remember? You were there when we did the deal.
this is outrageous. she can't do that.
well, good luck stopping her.
you don't still want to have lunch, do you?
Yes, i still want to do lunch.
okay. Fine.
well, i see i no longer have a parking spot.
God, you scared me.
I'm sorry. Or maybe not.
what are you doing here?
Oh, yes.
I forgot how quickly news spreads in your family.
well, did you think i was just not gonna say anything?
no, but i would've appreciated a call.
I'm feeling ambushed. - Join the club.
Nora, saving a business requires sacrifice.
now you asked me to step in
we're only acting responsibly.
well, i wonder if you would be acting this responsibly
you know, if this involved rebecca,
I hope that i would do exactly the same thing.
well, that certainly explains Why she isn't talking to you anymore.
you know, i am trying to be patient right now.
but you are making it very hard.
I'm making that hard?
you know, nora, this is really tommy's call.
I thought you were the c. e.o.
fine.
then as the c. e.o. Let me make this perfectly clear.
this is a busiss decision,
which is very fitting since ojai foods is a business.
this is no longer william's company.
so you don't have the right to barge in here and make demands.
if you have something that you need to say,
then pick up the phone, make an appointment,
park in the visitor's parking lot
and hike on up here just like everybody else.
now i know this is hard for someone like you to stomach,
but the family circus is over.
I swear, holly thinks she's running u. s. steel.
she keeps coming up With these ridiculous organizational crts,
and every day, my square gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
do me a favor.

I have some work stuff on my mind, all right?
I know, but can't you just forget about the business For a minute?
sorry to interrupt.
I-I left elizabeth with scotty. I-i think she's getting a little hungry.
Oh, okay.
I'll get her. - Thanks.
look at that view.
Yeah, smooth move, mom. let me guess.
you talked to sah.
to?? you're trying with ojai.
I don't blame you for any of this,
but you can't firec?? just because holly wants you to.
you have to learn to push back with her.
mom-- - If you and sarah stand together, there's nothing she can do.
you don't understand.
this was my idea.
your idea?
Yeah.
Holly just agreed with me.
if you look at the books, we can't afford him.
I am doing this to save the company, mom.
you can't. You can't.
you see how proud he is out there. You can't.
do you think i want to do this?
Tommy, he's your brother.
I know.
?? He hil to the beach. You want to come?
what, and leave my family unchaperoned? I don't think so.
you know, kitty and sarah have already started
you love it. - Love what?
all of them being here, hosted by you,
Mr. "i've got the keys to a fabulous beach house,
soon-to-be partner of a major l. a. law firm.
you forgot just married.
Oh, right. that little detail. - You know what?
I think i do.
I think i love being lord of the manner.
mm, that's 'cause you like being the center of attention, ?? In your family.
Yeah.
actually, it's amazing none of us went into show business.
well, you've been working like a crazy person.
you deserve to be the center of attention.
don't go to the beach just yet.
Why? What do you have in mind?
Kevin, your family's here. what if they spill something?
I've alre'vy taken care of that.
Kevin's making me drink outside.
hmm, me, too.
God. You know, it's really actually Quite beautiful out here.

Oh, don't worryout it.
?? You said some...
very nice things, And...

I loved that story about me third grade??
because hether only gave her apples for dessert??
Yeah. I just...
I thought it epitomized you.
that story s ver in the lette??
it never even happened.
God. I should've known.
you would never give your cookies away to anyone.
it's not funny.
Oh, god. Why didn't i finish reading that letter?
you didn't even read it? - No, i did, most of it.
God, i almost even wrote it.
I ran out of time. i was talking to mom...
of course, mom. mom wrote it.
she offered to help. - you didn't have to say yes.
I mean, come on, sarah, what's going on with you?
you had, like, a month to write it.
sorry, kitty. I'm just-- i'm at the end of my rope.
I have never been this stressed.
I'm about to do The biggest thing i've ever done in my life,
and i asked you to help me.
God, what are you even worried about?
you're married to a senator. you are gonna get a baby.
you know what? ??
you always, always make the assumption That my life is so easy.
?? You know, i think it's because You're so obsessed with youritown ?? That you can see in mine is what you don't have.
that is not fair.
you don't even know what's been going on.
then why don't you tell me? - I can't.
Oh, god. i shouldn't.
okay, it's about dad. kevin found out some things.
you remember the photo?
Oh, god, please, not again. - i know you think i'm crazy.
I'm not. It's true. - No, seriously
dad had another child. Mom doesn't want anyone to know.
otherwise, we would've told you.
speak to kevin.
we have a phone number.
his name is ryan lafferty.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god. Paige, cooper, are you okay?
I left you alone for five minutes. What happened?
I wanted to get the whale. - Oh, this is bad. This is
this is really bad. - Oh, my god. What happened?
no.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
the whale. Look at the whale. i'm a dead man.
I'm a dead man. who did this?
who did this?
I did, kevin. i'm--i'm sorry.
?? Was a kid, I made a ton of model airplanes.
so this is gonna be as good as new.
Thanks.
maybe when you're done. you could repair my career.
it'll be all right, honey. We're gonna get this all cleaned up.
mom, please, don't even try??
Tommy, don't let the kids come in here. They'll step on the glass.
it's okay, mom. they're with scotty and julia.
you know, i still don't understand What you were doing in here, justin.
I'm sorry, okay??
no. - kitty, - we could use some help over here. - I'm not even talking to you.
what did i do? - Oh, don't play dumb, mother.
you wrote sarah's letter of recommendation.
you told her? - ??
you were right. - Yeah.
Yeah, ?? ly there are Certain members of this family who are
what exactly did you tell her? Does this concern me and
I've just been informed that dad does have another child out there.
Oh, you know what? If this is another one of sarah's crazy ideas, - I'm not listening. - i'm not crazy. Kevin, can you please tell them?
no. - ?? a couple of days ago, i met up with an old friend of dad's.
the photo we found is of a boy named ryan.
dad was very close to his mother. - Well, that's hardly concrete evidence.
I know. - We could call him.
Kevin has his number. - You have his number?
no one is calling anyone. - Mom, the cat is out of the bag.
put it back in. - Mom, are--are you okay?
I'm fine, i'm fine, i'm fine.
believe me, Nothing your father has done will surprise me ever again.
I just don't think there's any value in pursuing this.
well, i'm sorry??
what do you think will happen if wactually find this guy?
I mean, we got lucky with rebecca.
we don't know anything about him.
Yeah, i agree??
it was a little touchy in the beginning.
Tommy. - I'm right here, you know?
?? can't just sweep this back under the rug.
it's just better if everything is out in the open.
Yeah. Rebecca and ian??
Justin. - justin, not now, sweetheart.
Yeah, we kind of assumed that anyway. - i didn't assume anything.
you know what? While we're e truth?? I didn't break this damn whale, okay?
Cooper did.
?? - who cares?
?? I carab - okay, justin and rebecca doesn't it feel better Now that everybody knows?
?? sarah, thiis different.
how? - ryan is a very loaded situation.
we can't just go cold-calling potential family members - Because we're curious. - ??
this is about the truth. We owe this ryan the truth.
why are you so worried about what we owe him?
Yeah, really. look, sarah, Ojai's having enough trouble right now.
we don't need another person trying to make a claim to
a claim? Oh, my god?? - ??
wait. Rebecca, wait.
I'll come with you. - no, stay here.
you're unbelievable. - what?
not everything is about money, tommy.
no, no, of course not, sarah, because it's all about you.
why don't you try being a sister to me first
before you start dragging somebody else into the mix?
I have done-- - Stop, stop, stop.
you see? This is why i didn't want everyone to know.
look what's happening. We're just talking about the guy.
mom, our problems started way before ryan came along.
right. I mean, tommy's plans have nothing to do with ryan.
Sarah, don't. - No, i'm done. I am done...
Sarah, do not say anything. - Keeping the family secrets.
I'm sorry. he's letting you go, kevin.
Oh, sarah. - what? - Holly and tommy have decided that you're expendable.
Oh, sarah! - What?
we're making cuts at ojai. - Yeah.
restructuring.
Oh, my god.
if you knew how important that account was...
you know, mom, forget about the mess.
Sarah, you are like a dog with a bone.
you guys make politics look tame.
Yeah, you know what? let's go.
look, i wanted you to hear it from me.
Yeah, that would've been nice.
Ojai is having a cash problem, obviously, And...
and now that's my problem. - You mean i'm your problem.
no, it's the business.
dad did whatever he had to do to make it a success.
now i didn't always understand his choices
Yeah, you're right. ??
you're not listening to me.
he knew that without a healthy, profitable company,
none of us would feel secure.
now i'm sorry. I know this feels cold and ruthless.
but i'm doing this for the right reasons.
I'm doing this for the family.
Tommy, did it ever occur to you
that he did that for a reason?
you can go on about him all you want,
but this is not what he would've wanted.
you're my brother, And i love you, but this has to be done. And i'm sorry, really.
I'm--I'm not trying to hurt you.
if you want to draw a line in the sand, please do,
and put me on one side and stand on the other.
but if you do, there is absolutely no going back from that.
Kevin-- - No.
Kev-- - no.
c-- - what?
Justin, i asked you not to say anything.
I know my family, okay?
and i knew it'd go over a lot better If they were distracted
go over better?
Becca, why are you so upset?
because, justin, now that they know,
everything changes.
I mean, have you ever honestly thought about
you'll be fine, and i-i will be the ex-girlfriend
look, that is so not true. Okay?
everybody in that house loves you.
no, they are?? In how to deal with my replacement.
and honestly, it's not like there's enough room at the table
for ex-girlfriends and ex-sisters.
Rebecca, where are you going?
I just--you know what? i gotta go home.
I don't want to be here anymore.
is kitty still up?
you know, she's had a pretty tough day.
I think maybe you ought to talk to her tomorrow.
she's that furious?
she's that hurt.
right.
I really want to fix this up.
I mean, she's my sister. i love her, obviously.
nobody can slide the knife between the ribs Quite like the people who love us.
Yeah.
you're not gonna let me off the hook here, are you?
is that what you came for?
look, come by tomorrow. I'm sure she'll be more receptive.
good night. - Night.
yo, can you pass the sports section, kev?
Scotty, the frittata is wonderful. - Oh, thank you.
take your time.
it's white bean and rosemary? - yes, yeah.
it's really lovely. - thank you.
good morning. - good morning.
good morning.
okay.
is kitty up yet?
they left early this morning.
Oh, damn.
I guess i'll have to talk to her later.
mom, i think we're just gonna pack up and
Hey, you know what??? - Sure. Where's rebecca?
she left last night.
Yeah, tommy and julia left last night, too.
we're like rats deserting a sinking ship.
Sarah, can i get you any, um, breakfast?
no, thanks, scotty. I just lost my appetite.
Sarah, scotty made a delicious frittata.
at least you can sit down and have a few bites.
okay, mother. i shall stay for breakfast.
good.
great.
okay, kevin. I am so sorry about the shelf.
of course i will pay for anything that broke.
don't worry about it. - And before i do any more damage,
I'd just like to say That i've been thinking a lot about everything,
and i realize that perhaps i am not the best person
to decide about what we do about ryan.
well, that's big of you. - oh, give me a break.
I'm done with trying To convince anybody to do anything.
you're the head of this family.
I think you should decide.
it would've been nice If you'd come to that conclusion yesterday.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
you need some help?
Nah.
it's my first apartment. I should probabl p it by myself??
Rebecca, look, about last night. I just wanted to say i'm sorry.
I mean, god, you've lost so much in this last month,
I mean, your mom and-- and david, And...
I should've been more sensitive To what you were feeling.
I'm just scared.
if i lose you and your family, what do i have left?
look, you
you're not the only one who's scared, though.
Rebecca, you're my best friend in this world.
do you think i want to risk losing that?
the thing is, i think we have to.
risk it, i mean.
maybe we should stop wasting time Worrying about how it might end...
because maybe...
you know, maybe... maybe it won't end.
can we start over...
without all the pressure?
there's a roller right behind you. We could start with that.
okay.
?? So is thisad time to tell you That this is the worst color on the planet?
Justin! - what?
well, that was a quick trip. I don't even have any laundry.
I think your family's Got enough dirty laundry for all of us.
is that her? - she's worse than my mother when she wants to talk.
you're gonna have to talk to her eventually.
Why? - Because she's not gonna stop until you do, And...
you love her.
okay.
too late.
look, she was sorry when she came to talk to you last night.
Robert, i know.
you keep on telling me that. - i don't understand.
all of the horrible things i've seen your family Do to each other, - what about this is so terrible? - it's not just about the letter.
Sarah has a completely unrealistic view of my life.
she always has.
she thinks that everything Comes so easily to me,
and that is not how it is. I have struggled in my career.
it took me forever to meet you
Ah, but it was worth the wait, wasn't it?
Robert, i'm serious. How can i rely on sarah to help me
if she doesn't even know that i have any problems?
she probably doesn't.
?? You put on ry brave facra ?? so what?-a
and by the way, who are you defending?
because it doesn't sound like you're defending me.
?? That if you think this is part of a larger problem,
you should say something.
okay, but when do you get to the point
do you really think you and sarah are there?
I don't know.
how much damage was there?
some--some pottery, a ceramic bowl And two glass vases.
they were la marina vases.
I didn't know that.
anything else?
a whale.
Yeah.
there is one oth o??
we lost ojai as a client.
how?
my--my brother fired us.
they're in a financial bind. they're trying to save money.
you had a hell of a weekend, didn't you?
Yes, sir, i did.
well...
you better get back to work.
Yes, sir.
keys.
your brother tommy's on the line.
he's called about four times now.
tell him i'm in a meeting.
are you sure? - Yep.
okay. No problem.
don't wod in the vis t??
Yes, but you didn't make an appointment,
so i-if you'll excuse me.
no, i won't excuse you.
I've been excung you and ms??
giving you the benefit of the doubt, when really, I should've known that nothing
Nora, you live??
where no one gets hurt And everyone gets what they want.
well, i do expect when i make a deal with someone,
they stick to it.
Oh, well, then maybe you should've read the fine print,
because i don't owe you anything.
you promised you would not??
that you would let sarah and tommy run it.
instead, you have put yourself in a position to hurt kevin.
I told you, - talk to tommy about that. - And you've poisoned tommy.
you have never stopped relishing In trying to humiliate me.
well, right now, you're doing a pretty good job Of embarrassing yourself.
I wasn't really sure i was gonna tell you this, But...
I realize, My whole family knows about it.
it's really only a matter of time until you find out,
and i want to be here when you do.
find out about what?
OKing ar was once william's wlild??
but you don't know the half of it.
he had another lover.
and they had a child together...
a boy...
Ryan.
I don't believe you.
Yes, you do.
Hi.
Sarah. - i know you have a party.
when i saw all the cars, i almost turned around And went home,
but i wanted you to get this in time.
here.
that's really sweet of you.
but i've already sent all the materials To the agency.
well, then give me the address. I'll overnight it.
honestly, you have to include this in your packet.
after i wrote it, i wanted to give you my kids.
they're really strict about deadlines and...
I don't want to ask for any special treatment.
listen, kitty, i want to fix this.
I want you to know how sorry i am,
how much you mean to me, before another day goes by.
Sarah, i already know that.
I mean, you're my sister.
we love each other unconditionally,
just like mom's overflowing fountain And her magical glue,
but that's not the problem between us.
then what is the problem?
can we talk about this tomorrow?
no, tell me now.
it's trust.
the problem between us is trust.
Kit-- sweetie, who is it?
go, go. Go.
dear birth mother, ?? sarah walker.
Kitty walker mccallister is my sister.
there is nobody who would make a better mother than kitty, "not just because of who she is but because of who she wants threst of us to be.
she has so much hope for the people she loves, "even when the road we're on turns steep and uncertain.
no one i know understands family more than she does
that we're here to help each other, "and that part of that means we must be patient with our differences.
she also knows that it's only by giving "that we gain the things that truly matter.
it's funny.
I'm her big sister, but often, i forget that.
because the truth is that most of the time, i look up to her.
is everything okay?
Yeah. It will be.
I hope it will be.
I now pronounce them. -married.
you owe a substantial amount of money.
a merger is our only offer.
who would run the company?
Sarah and I would be copresidents.
Holly will assume the role of chairman and C. E.O.
let's adopt. -Oh, Robert.
Rebecca is not your biological sister.
what if it was all just a way to meet you?
the only reason dad left you any money was that he thought that Rebecca was his daughter.
are you joking? - Explain his passwords then
the initials of all his children, the last one was "R."
there was another "r," but it was never Rebecca.
it was a boy, and his name was Ryan.
mom, we have something we need to tell you.
dear birth mother, "my name is Sarah walker."
if you're reading this, "you must be hoping to find someone to adopt your unborn baby."
there is no one I know who would be a better mother than my little sister Kitty.
first let me tell you a little about our family.
Justin, the baby of the family," is a war veteran.
Kevin is a lawyer who married his partner Scotty.
and Tommy, the oldest of the boys, he's married to julia.
he runs our family business, which now includes a winery.
as crazy as it sounds, "they are each other's best friends."
and what holds this big brood together?
our mother Nora.
"a better role model " I could not wish for any mother.
"a better grandmother "I could not wish for your baby.
a better friend I could not wish for the world.
and when she brings us all together, it is family at its best.
a walker dinner is a sight to behold. The love just radiates.
and any new baby would be welcome into this joyous scene with open arms and hearts.
but no heart is bigger, no arms more open than my wonderful sister Kitty.
imagine a fountain that overflows with unconditional love.
imagine a magical glue that holds people together.
imagine a pied piper from Pasadena.
children are drawn to her wherever she goes.
that's our Kitty.
what gives this remarkable woman her strength?
we do-- her brothers, her sister, her mother, her family.
it goes on like that for six pages.
I mean, some poor woman could spend her entire last trimester slogging through this thing.
I don't think she wrote it. I think she got it off the internet at schmaltz-fest.com.
more likely she sat down one night, cracked open a bottle of merlot and just kept writing until she lost consciousness.
maybe she hired somebody to write it.
I mean, you gotta admit, this is laying it on pretty thick.
honey, we're asking someone to give us their child.
it's hardly a time for humility.
we should be glad she finished it.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
there's no point in obsessing over it.
exactly.
look how long it is.
well, is it a crime to go on about how much you love your sister?
well, she goes on about everybody.
What'd she say about me?
nothing compared to what she says about mom.
Get--oh, here. Get a load of this.
a better grandmother I could not wish for your baby.
a better friend I could not wish for the world.
okay, the world.
all right. Maybe it's a little over the top.
but what do you want her to do, be honest? She's trying to put us all in the best light.
Hi.
what are you doing here?
does she need a reason? - No.
actually, I was just, uh, I was gonna ask you if I could borrow the, -uh, the lamp in the attic? -The floorlamp?
Yeah. - Absolutely. Take it.
awesome. Thank you.
How's--how's your place?
uh, you know, right now it's so empty it echoes.
but, hey, at least with the lamp, now I'll be able to see what I don't have.
do you even have any sheets and towels?
Oh, Nora, it's okay. Really.
no, no, go up to the closet. Take some linens.
I have more sets than I know what to do with.
Really?
cool. Thanks.
uh, okay.
Oh, she better not take the ones with e robots.
those are my-- you remember those.
Yeah, well, I gotta go, mom. I'll catch you later.
well, don't forget your letter.
I'm tellin' ya, there's a ghostwriter in here somewhere.
don't be silly.
when you see her, you might wanna thank her.
well, if she ever stops rescheduling our plans, maybe I will.
all right.
fine.
Oh, god. You didn't tell her you wrote it, did you?
of course not. Have you even read it yet?
well, I tried. I fell asleep on page four.
Oh, for god sake's.
would you please read it so at least you can be familiar with what it is you said?
I should have just told her the truth--I'm insanely busy, the kids are driving me crazy, not to mention Holly.
no, no, no. You can't tell her the truth.
she's so stressed out by all of this, and it'll just hurt her feelings.
Sarah, just don't act guilty. It'll all blow over.
mother, you should know that the cover-up is always worse than the crime.
didn't you learn anything from dad?
God, Sarah. You don't have to slam things.
if you would stop dredging up the past, then your father wouldn't be an issue.
mom, I'm not dredging up anything, and I'm trying to get the air conditioning to come on, and excuse me if I'm a little curious about the fact that I have a half brother lurking out there somewhere.
I told you I don't want to talk about this Ryan person.
read the letter. We never had this conversation.
okay, mata hari.
we're being summoned, Sarah.
by the almighty? - Yeah.
we're gonna condense the packaging department.
Walker landing has a more efficient system, so
w-wait a minute. Are you telling me that you're getting rid of entire department in this company?
saul, you have to stop looking at this as if there's two different companies.
we are in this precarious situation because of the merger, and we are stuck with these difficult decisions.
Sarah, what's--what's wrong? - Nothing.
it's just nice and cool in here, that's all.
I replaced the air conditioner.
Oh, I thought we were trying to save money.
with a more energy efficient one.
look, Sarah, nobody's happy about this, but we have a $20-million loan hanging over our heads.
cuts are gonna have to be made across the board.
why do I get the feeling I'm about to be fired?
you're not, but other people will have to be.
Oh, that leaves me, then. -No, not you, Sarah.
no, we are looking at the legal team.
the legal team? You mean Kevin?
no, I mean his law firm, which has been charging Ojai foods an exorbitant amount of money. - Come on. They're competitive.
Holly, just a minute. You're not serious?
you know what Kevin has done for this company?
you can't just throw him overboard for just a few bucks.
no, no, Saul, I'm not talking about a few bucks.
now I have found a law firm that is so much more cost-effective.
are you really gonna go along with her on this?
do you think I want to fire my own brother? - I don't know.
well, I don't, and if things turn around, we can bring him back.
Yes. - That's nice.
Kevin's gonna be so happy to hear that.
are you gonna tell him?
we got our earnings report today.
did you know that you were our number one associate this month? -No, I didn't.
all that extra work you put on the Ojai merger put you over the top.
now we were very impressed at the partners' meeting.
we're keeping our eye on you.
thank you. - One more thing.
Cynthia and I are not using the house in Laguna beach this weekend, so.
you're welcome to it.
I...I don't know what to say.
feel free to invite your family.
it's sort of a, uh, well, a token of our firm's appreciation.
thank you s-so much. That's so generous.
but, uh, there's-- there's actually a lot of them.
it sleeps 12.
so he just gave you the keys?
U know who else got these keys?
Alice Rogers, and she's a partner now.
Yeah, and you know who else? Joe jensen--partner now.
Congratulations.
are you gonna invite your whole family? -What, are you crazy?
I thought it slept 12. -Yeah, it does.
but this weekend, it's gonna sleep two.
I've got Doug Manning to see you.
bring him in.
did you hear that? -Do you have to go?
Yeah, I do. Call you back. Bye.
Mr. Manning, I am so glad you could come by.
no problem. M-my office is just a couple of blocks away.
take a seat.
I'm sure you don't remember.
we did actually meet several years ago at a conference in Chicago.
you were speaking with my father about a lady you both worked with who died in a car accident.
right, because this is a.
this is a picture you gave my father.
did Connie have a son named Ryan?
is this his picture?
what's this about?
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I didn't keep track of Connie's family after she died. Sorry.
Mr. Manning, please.
I just need to get in touch with him.
I heard her husband moved the family to Bakersfield after she died.
thank you.
Yeah, and we haven't done anything yet, which is why we wanted to talk to you first.
but we really think the family should know.
know, know what? We don't know anything.
Kevin's tracked down a phone number.
this isn't hypothetical.
he's out there. - Yeah.
where?
I know this is hard for you mom, but do we really want to wait until there's a knock at the door?
you know, I-I am not going to be sucked into this.
things are crazy enough in this family right now without you wanting to bring another walker
it's not.
-Hi.
Oh, hi.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I'm, um, meeting Sarah for lunch.
bring another walker where? -Bring another walker where?
I don't know, sweetheart.
well, then what are you talking about?
we were just talking about, uh, bringing another walker to Laguna.
Oh, oh, who - who's in Laguna?
uh, m-my boss has given me the keys to his place in Laguna for the weekend.
Oh, well, that's nice. But why did you come all the way over here to say that?
because we're all invited.
wh--I mean, we're talking about that as a possibility.
a possibility. -I would love to go to Laguna.
Oh, I see.
robert and I are the only ones who aren't invited, right?
Oh, no, no. Everyone's invited, right, mom?
Paige and Coop are gonna be thrilled.
Oh, I don't know, mom. You know, Kevin and Scotty probably want the place to themselves.
they only just got married. - well.
and they're practically newlyweds.
but wait a minute. Didn't you just drive all the way over here to invite us?
Yeah.
isn't it exciting?
your brother is on the fast track to make partner.
I am so proud of you.
Yeah, and speaking of which, I-- wow, I have to get back to the office.
so I'll-- I'll tell Scotty the good news. Everyone's coming?
Yeah. -Yeah.
great.
enjoy lunch. -Bye.
call Tommy from the car.
Oh, god, no, not Tommy.
well, what's wrong with Tommy?
I don't even know how to tell you this. - Sarah
no, mom, what you don't know, what nobody knows, especially Kevin, is that Tommy and Holly have decided to fire him.
they're gonna fire Kevin?
and there is nothing I can do about it.
well, just say no.
Oh, I work for Holly harper now, mom.
remember? You were there when we did the deal.
this is outrageous. She can't do that.
well, good luck stopping her.
you don't still want to have lunch, do you?
Yes, I still want to do lunch. -Okay.
fine.
well, I see I no longer have a parking spot.
God, you scared me.
I'm sorry. Or maybe not.
what are you doing here?
Oh, yes.
I forgot how quickly news spreads in your family.
well, did you think I was just not gonna say anything?
no, but I would've appreciated a call.
I'm feeling ambushed. - Join the club.
Nora, saving a business requires sacrifice.
now you asked me to step in-- to keep Ojai in the family, not to fire my son.
we're only acting responsibly.
well, I wonder if you would be acting this responsibly if it were about Rebecca.
you know, if this involved Rebecca, I hope that I would do exactly the same thing.
well, that certainly explains why she isn't talking to you anymore.
you know, I am trying to be patient right now.
but you are making it very hard.
I'm making that hard?
you know, Nora, this is really Tommy's call.
I thought you were the C. E.O.
fine.
then as the C. E.O. Let me make this perfectly clear.
this is a business decision, which is very fitting since Ojai foods is a business.
this is no longer William's company.
so you don't have the right to barge in here and make demands.
if you have something that you need to say, then pick up the phone, make an appointment, park in the visitor's parking lot and hike on up here just like everybody else.
now I know this is hard for someone like you to stomach, but the family circus is over.
I swear, Holly thinks she's running U. S. Steel.
she keeps coming up with these ridiculous organizational charts, and every day, my square gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
do me a favor.
just tell me what it's like to have a great job and a gorgeous husband and a ranch in Santa Barbara.
don't leave any details out.
okay, if you promise to tell me what it's like to have two beautiful kids.
Oh, gosh. I wouldn't know.
my angels have recently morphed into these little monsters.
I swear. I'm very close to just driving a little woon stake through both their little hearts.
well, so much for unconditional love.
you don't remember?
first I gush it out on everyone like - like a fountain, and then I use it to glue people together.
too maudlin?
well, it--you know, it just didn't sound like you.
I think I got a little carried away.
I'm sorry it took me so long. Are you mad at me?
Oh, god! And the other thing-- we're cost cutting at work, but Holly installs a brand-new air conditioning unit in her office.
now it is sucking the life out of everybody else's.
Rebecca, give me. all your 7s.
Ooh, go fish.
Oh, crap.
Paige, what did you say?
mom says it all the time.
I don't want to play anymore.
no, that's not fair. I'm winning.
that's so not fair. You're just a sore loser.
you're the loser.
okay, okay, I think that it's time to go upstairs and get your homework done.
Oh, crap. Oh, crap. Oh, crap.
what's going on in here?
Cooper said "crap."
Yeah, I heard him, and I also heard Rebecca tell you guys to go upstairs and do your homework.
I don't have any homework.
Paige, do you realize that your uncle Justin invented the "I don't have any homework" dodge. before you were born?
so why don't we march our cute little butts upstairs and do some homework, all right?
homework!
homework!
homework!
homework!
homework!
homework!
homework!
home-- hey.
we really need to get better this.
what, this? -No, the hiding it part.
we don't have to hide anything. We're not doing anything wrong.
look, I just--I don't want to announce anything yet ada malo. Because, you know, we're not even sure what we are
you want to spend the whole weekend in Laguna pretending?
unless you want your family watching us the whole time to see what's going on.
mm, okay.
uncle Justin?
Oh, crap.
okay, so I go to make a pitcher of martinis, and I look in the bar, and i find about 20 "up" glasses, and all of them are baccarat crystal.
they're gorgeous.
Yeah, well, put 'em all back. Cause this is my family, so they can use paper cups.
where were you? -Bathroom number five.
my goal for the weekend is to pee in all eight.
well, then you better drink up.
why is this pink? -It's pomegranate-- full of antioxidants.
no, no, no, no. I like my family oxidized.
and you know what gets pomegranate juice stains out?
absolutely nothing, okay?
clear liquids from now on--g, vodka and consomm? Cheers.
okay, time to move everything my family could ruin.
like our romantic vacation for two?
look, I am so sorry, okay? I just panicked.
no, it's okay. I'd freak out, too, if I had random new siblings springing up all the time.
please remember you're not supposed to know, okay?
mom's head would explode. And don't ask Kitty about the adoption.
she's really stressed out about it, and please don't mention to Sarah me making partner.
I don't think we should rub her nose in it now that her career is circling the drain.
wow, this fish is really heavy.
Yeah, that fish is a whale, and it cost more than your car.
Really?
now I hate my car.
you know what? I'm glad we're hosting.
it's the least we can do after everything your family's done for us.
you're so much nicer than I am.
you know what? When I make partner, I'm gonna buy you two whales-- moby and dick.
you had a head start. -That's not fair.
Hey, kids. You ready to have fun?
Hey, can we go outside?
of course. Check out the pool.
be careful! -oh, I got an eye on 'em.
everyone's right behind me. It was like a motorcade coming down here.
this place is obscene. -Right?
I'm so sorry you got roped into having the whole family.
you know what? I've decided this is gonna be great.
I mean, come on. Look at this place.
you're right.
you.
let's enjoy ourselves. You gonna give me the tour?
it's okay. You can leave 'em there.
with a good wind behind it, this place could take off.
mommy, can I have some soda? -No, absolutely not.
you're jacked up enough as it is.
you can have grape juice with water.
uh, how about just water? -I hate water.
Hey, you guys, we're here.
how are you?
well, I didn't expect to see you here.
why not? We were invited.
well, it should be interesting.
when are you gonna tell him?
Hey, Kev, this-- this place is incredible, man.
the life of a partner, and since Ojai's a big reason I may become one, you get the master bedroom.
come on. You know, you don't have to do that.
yo, this place freakin' rocks.
jeez.
you guys carpool?
us? No, no. I-I drove alone.
Oh, I came with mom.
I can't believe it. Tommy's here.
just keep smiling. Let's not ruin the weekend before it starts.
don't worry. I'm gonna talk to him.
he just has to learn to stand up to that woman.
Hi, everyone! -Hi, mom.
Oh, my gosh! Look at this. It's amazing.
uncle Justin. -Yeah.
can you get Coop a soda?
uh, is it okay with your mom?
of course not, but you don't want anybody to find out about you and Rebecca, do you?
this is blackmail.
you promise to keep your mouth shut?
all right, here, you little monster.
it's diet.
so?
uncle Justin. -Yeah?
these don't work. -All right, let me see 'em.
the screen went dark, and it just said "video 6. " Can you fix it?
uh, yeah, yeah. You know what? I'll, uh, I'll fix it later.
no, I want to watch "Hannah Montana" now.
fine. I'll see what I can do.
I can't believe Kevin gave us this room.
I'm gonna spend the entire weekend going back and forth between the pool and the hot tub.
Yeah.
Tommy, what is it?
it's too beautiful of a day for you to be in a bad mood.
what? Nothing.
look, I just-- I have some work stuff on my mind, all right?
I know, but can't you just forget about the business for a minute?
sorry to interrupt.
I-I left elizabeth with Scotty.
I-I think she's getting a little hungry.
Oh, okay. Uh, I'll get her. Thanks.
look at that view.
Yeah, smooth move, mom. Let me guess.
you talked to Sarah.
Tommy, I know how hard you're trying with Ojai.
I don't blame you for any of this, but you can't fire Kevin just because Holly wants you to.
you have to learn to push back with her.
mom-- if you and Sarah stand together, there's nothing she can do.
you don't understand.
this was my idea.
your idea? -Yeah.
Holly just agreed with me.
if you look at the books, we can't afford him.
I am doing this to save the company, mom.
you can't. You can't.
you see how proud he is out there. You can't.
do you think I want to do this?
Tommy, he's your brother.
I know.
here you are.
I'm thinking of heading down the hills to the beach. You want to come?
what, and leave my family unchaperoned? I don't think so.
you know, Kitty and Sarah have already started throwing back your pomegranate martinis.
you love it. -Love what?
all of them being here, hosted by you,
Mr. "I've got the keys to a fabulous beach house, soon-to-be partner of a major L. A. Law firm."
you forgot just married.
Oh, right. That little detail.
you know what? I think I do.
I think I love being lord of the manner.
mm, that's 'cause you like being the center of attention, like everybody else in your family.
Yeah. Actually, it's amazing none of us went into show business.
well, you've been working like a crazy person.
you deserve to be the center of attention.
don't go to the beach just yet.
Why? What do you have in mind?
Kevin, your family's here. What if they spill something?
I've already taken care of that.
Kevin's making me drink outside. -me, too.
Oh, god. You know, it's really actually quite beautiful out here.
you know, Sarah, I know I've been really weird about it, but.
your letter meant a lot to me. - Oh, don't worry about it.
no, really. You said some.
very nice things, and. and I.
I loved that story about me in the third grade.
that one.
Yeah, the one where I used to give the cookies to the little girl because her mother only gave her apples for dessert.
Yeah. I just.
I thought it epitomized you.
that story was never in the letter. It never even happened.
God. I should've known. You would never give your cookies away to anyone.
it's not funny.
Oh, god. Why didn't I finish reading that letter?
you didn't even read it?
no, I did, most of it.
God, I almost even wrote it.
I ran out of time. I was talking to mom.
Oh, of course, mom. Mom wrote it.
she offered to help.
you didn't have to say yes.
I mean, come on, Sarah, what's going on with you?
you had, like, a month to write it.
sorry, Kitty. I'm just-- I'm at the end of my rope.
I have never been this stressed.
I'm about to do the biggest thing I've ever done in my life, and I asked you to help me.
God, what are you even worried about?
you're married to a senator. You are gonna get a baby.
you know what? You always do this.
you always, always make the assumption that my life is so easy.
you know, I think it's because you're so obsessed with your own life that the only thing that you can see in mine is what you don't have.
that is not fair.
you don't even know what's been going on.
then why don't you tell me? -I can't.
Oh, god. I shouldn't.
okay, it's about dad. Kevin found out some things.
you remember the photo?
Oh, god, please, not again. -I know you think I'm crazy.
I'm not. - It's true.
no, seriously-- dad had another child.
mom doesn't want anyone to know. Otherwise, we would've told you.
speak to Kevin.
we have a phone number.
his name is Ryan lafferty.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god. Paige, Cooper, are you okay?
I left you alone for five minutes. What happened?
I wanted to get the whale.
Oh, this is bad. This is-- this is really bad.
Oh, my god. What happened?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
the whale.
look at the whale. I'm a dead man.
I'm a dead man. Who did this?
who did this?
I did, Kevin. I'm--I'm sorry.
you know, when I was a kid, I made a ton of model airplanes.
so this is gonna be as good as new.
Thanks.
maybe when you're done. You could repair my career.
it'll be all right, honey. We're gonna get this all cleaned up.
mom, please, don't even try. I'm inconsolable.
Tommy, don't let the kids come in here. They'll step on the glass.
it's okay, mom. They're with Scotty and julia.
you know, I still don't understand what you were doing in here, Justin.
I'm sorry, okay. Jeez, drop it, Kevin.
Kitty, we could use some help over here.
I'm not even talking to you. -What did I do?
Oh, don't play dumb, mother.
you wrote Sarah's letter of recommendation.
you told her? -She figured it out, mom.
you were right. -Yeah.
Yeah, apparently there are certain members of this family who are
are keeping all kinds of secrets.
Sarah. -what exactly did you tell her?
does this concern me and-- Justin.
Yes, yes, Justin, this concerns all of us.
I've just been informed that dad does have another child out there.
Oh, you know what? If this is another one of Sarah's crazy ideas, I'm not listening.
I'm not crazy. Kevin, can you please tell them?
no.
a couple of days ago, I met up with an old friend of dad's the photo we found is of a boy named Ryan.
dad was very close to his mother.
well, that's hardly concrete evidence. -I know.
we could call him.
Kevin has his number. -You have his number?
no one is calling anyone.
mom, the cat is out of the bag. -Put it back in.
mom, are--are you okay?
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
believe me, nothing your father has done will surprise me ever again.
I just don't think there's any value in pursuing this.
well, I'm sorry, but I disagree.
what do you think will happen if we actually find this guy?
I mean, we got lucky with Rebecca.
we don't know anything about him.
Yeah, I agree. Even with Rebecca, it was a little touchy in the beginning.
Tommy. - I'm right here, you know?
can't just sweep this back under the rug.
it's just better if everything is out in the open.
Yeah. Rebecca and i have started dating.
Justin. -Justin, not now, sweetheart.
Yeah, we kind of assumed that anyway.
I didn't assume anything.
you know what? While we're telling the truth, I didn't break this damn whale, okay?
Cooper did. -Who cares?
I care.
okay, Justin and Rebecca, doesn't it feel better now that everybody knows?
Sarah, this is different.
how? -Ryan is a very loaded situation.
we can't just go cold-calling potential family members because we're curious.
I'm not curious, mom. This is about the truth.
we owe this Ryan the truth.
why are you so worried about what we owe him?
Yeah, really. Look, Sarah, Ojai's having enough trouble right now.
we don't need another person trying to make a claim to
a claim? Oh, my god. I'm going for a walk.
wait. Rebecca, wait. I'll come with you.
no, stay here.
you're unbelievable. -what?
not everything is about money, Tommy.
no, no, of course not, Sarah, because it's all about you.
why don't you try being a sister to me first before you start dragging somebody else into the mix?
I have done-- stop, stop, stop.
you see? This is why I didn't want everyone to know.
look what's happening. We're just talking about the guy.
mom, our problems started way before Ryan came along. -Right.
I mean, Tommy's plans have nothing to do with Ryan.
Sarah, don't. - No, I'm done.
I am done. Keeping the family secrets. -Sarah, do not say anything.
I'm sorry. He's letting you go, Kevin.
Oh, Sarah. - what?
Holly and Tommy have decided that you're expendable.
Oh, Sarah! - what?
we're making cuts at Ojai. -yeah.
restructuring.
Oh, my god.
if you knew how important that account was.
you know, mom, forget about the mess. - Kevin.
Sarah, you are like a dog with a bone.
you guys make politics look tame.
Yeah, you know what? Let's go.
look, I wanted you to hear it from me.
Yeah, that would've been nice.
Ojai is having a cash problem, obviously, and.
and now that's my problem. -You mean I'm your problem.
no, it's the business.
dad did whatever he had to do to make it a success.
now I didn't always understand his choices
Yeah, you're right. He was an enigma.
you're not listening to me.
he knew that without a healthy, profitable company, none of us would feel secure.
now I'm sorry. I know this feels cd and ruthless.
but I'm doing this for the right reasons.
I'm doing this for the family.
Tommy, did it ever occur to you that dad wanted me to be a part of this business, that he did that for a reason?
you can go on about him all you want, but this is not what he would've wanted.
you're my brother, and I love you, but this has to be done.
and I'm sorry, really. I'm--I'm not trying to hurt you.
if you want to draw a line in the sand, please do, and put me on one side and stand on the other.
but if you do, there is absolutely no going back from that.
Kevin-- no.
Kev-- no.
c-- what?
Justin, I asked you not to say anything.
I know my family, okay?
and I knew it'd go over a lot better if they were distracted
go over better?
Becca, why are you so upset?
because, Justin, now that they know, everything changes.
I mean, have you ever honestly thought about what's gonna happen to me if we break up?
you'll be fine, and I-I will be the ex-girlfriend that everyone wishes would just be polite and--and disappear.
look, that is so not true. Okay?
everybody in that house loves you.
no, they are completely wrapped up in how to deal with my replacement. What?
and honestly, it's not like there's enough room at the table for ex-girlfriends and ex-sisters.
Rebecca, where are you going?
I just--you know what? I gotta go home.
I don't want to be here anymore.
Oh, uh, is Kitty still up?
you know, she's had a pretty tough day.
I think maybe you ought to talk to her tomorrow.
she's that furious?
she's that hurt.
right. I really want to fix this up.
I mean, she's my sister. I love her, obviously.
nobody can slide the knife between the ribs quite like the people who love us.
Yeah.
you're not gonna let me off the hook here, are you?
is that what you came for?
look, come by tomorrow. I'm sure she'll be more receptive.
good night. - Night.
yo, can you pass the sports section, Kev?
Scotty, the frittata is wonderful. -Oh, thank you.
take your time.
it's white bean and rosemary? -Yes, yeah.
it's really lovely. -Thank you.
good morning. -Good morning.
good morning.
um, is Kitty up yet?
they left early this morning. -Oh, damn.
I guess I'll have to talk to her later.
mom, I think we're just gonna pack up and
Hey, you know what? Can I buy a ride with you?
sure. Where's Rebecca? - She left last night.
Yeah, Tommy and julia left last night, too.
we're like rats deserting a sinking ship.
Hey, Sarah, can I get you any, um, breakfast?
no, thanks, Scotty. I just lost my appetite.
Sarah, Scotty made a delicious frittata.
at least you can sit down and have a few bites.
okay, mother. I shall stay for breakfast. -Good.
great.
okay, Kevin. I am so sorry about the shelf.
of course I will pay for anything that broke. -Don't worry about it.
and before I do any more damage, I'd just like to say that I've been thinking a lot about everything, and I realize that perhaps I am not the best person to decide about what we do about Ryan.
well, that's big of you. -Oh, give me a break.
I'm done with trying to convince anybody to do anything.
you're the head of this family. I think you should decide.
it would've been nice if you'd come to that conclusion yesterday.
Yeah.
you need some help? -Nah.
it's my first apartment. I should probably do it by myself.
Rebecca, look, about last night. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
I mean, god, you've lost so much in this last month, I mean, your mom and--and david, and.
I should've been more sensitive to what you were feeling.
I'm just scared.
if I lose you and your family, what do I have left?
look, you-- you're not the only one who's scared, though.
Rebecca, you're my best friend in this world.
do you think I want to risk losing that?
the thing is, I think we have to.
risk it, I mean.
maybe we should stop wasting time worrying about how it might end.
because maybe.
you know, maybe. maybe it won't end.
can we start over.
without all the pressure?
there's a roller right behind you. We could start with that.
okay.
so is this a bad time to tell you that this is the worst color on the planet?
Justin! -What?
well, that was a quick trip. I don't even have any laundry.
I think your family's got enough dirty laundry for all of us.
is that her? - She's worse than my mother when she wants to talk.
you're gonna have to talk to her eventually.
Why? - Because she's not gonna stop until you do, and.
you love her.
Oh, okay.
too late.
look, she was sorry when she came to talk to you last night.
Oh, Robert, I know. You keep on telling me that. -I don't understand.
out of all of the horrible things I've seen your family do to each other, - what about this is so terrible? - It's not just about the letter.
Sarah has a completely unrealistic view of my life.
she always has.
she thinks that everything comes so easily to me, and that is not how it is.
I have struggled in my career.
it took me forever to meet you
Ah, but it was worth the wait, wasn't it?
Robert, I'm serious.
how can I rely on Sarah to help me if she doesn't even know that I have any problems?
she probably doesn't.
I mean, you put on a very brave face.
well, so what? She's my sister.
she's supposed to know me better
and by the way, who are you defending? Because it doesn't sound like you're defending me.
I'm not defending anyone. I'm just saying that if you think this is part of a larger problem, you should say something.
okay, but when do you get to the point where you stop expecting somebody to change?
do you really think you and Sarah are there?
I don't know.
how much damage was there?
uh, some--some pottery, a ceramic bowl and two glass vases.
they were la marina vases.
I didn't know that.
anything else?
a whale. -The whale?
Yeah.
there is one other thing.
we lost Ojai as a client. -How?
my--my brother fired us.
they're in a financial bind. They're trying to save money.
you had a hell of a weekend, didn't you?
Yes, sir, I did.
well.
you better get back to work. -Yes, sir.
the keys.
your brother Tommy's on the line.
he's called about four times now.
tell him I'm in a meeting.
are you sure? -Yep.
okay. No problem.
don't worry. I parked in the visitor's lot.
Yes, but you didn't make an appointment, so I-if you'll excuse me.
no, I won't excuse you.
I've been excusing you for months and months, giving you the benefit of the doubt, when really,
I should've known that nothing
nothing you have done since you first met William has been in the best interest of my family or me.
Nora, you live in a dream world where no one gets hurt and everyone gets what they want.
well, I do expect when I make a deal with someone, they stick to it.
Oh, well, then maybe you should've read the fine print, because I don't owe you anything.
you promised you would not micromanage this company, that you would let Sarah and Tommy run it.
instead, you have put yourself in a position to hurt Kevin.
I told you, talk to Tommy about that.
and you've poisoned Tommy.
you have never stopped relishing in trying to humiliate me.
well, right now, you're doing a pretty good job of embarrassing yourself.
I wasn't really sure I was gonna tell you this, but.
I realize, my whole family knows about it.
it's really only a matter of time until you find out, and I want to be here when you do.
find out about what?
Oh, Holly, it must feel so good sitting here and looking around at what was once William's world.
but you don't know the half of it.
he had another lover.
and they had a child together.
a boy. Ryan.
I don't believe you.
Yes, you do.
Hi. -Sarah.
I know you have a party. When I saw all the cars, I almost turned around and went home, but I wanted you to get this in time.
here.
that's really sweet of you.
but I've already sent all the materials to the agency.
well, then give me the address. I'll overnight it.
honestly, you have to include this in your packet.
after I wrote it, I wanted to give you my kids.
they're really strict about deadlines and.
I don't want to ask for any special treatment.
listen, Kitty, I want to fix this.
I want you to know how sorry I am, how much you mean to me, before another day goes by.
Sarah, I already know that.
I mean, you're my sister.
we love each other unconditionally, just like mom's overflowing fountain and her magical glue, but that's not the problem between us.
then what is the problem?
can we talk about this tomorrow? - No, tell me now.
it's trust.
the problem between us is trust.
kit-- sweetie, who is it?
Oh-- go, go. Go.
dear birth mother, I'm Sarah walker.
Kitty walker mccallister is my sister.
there is nobody who would make a better mother than Kitty, not just because of who she is but because of who she wants the rest of us to be.
she has so much hope for the people she loves, even when the road we're on turns steep and uncertain.
no one I know understands family more than she does
that we're here to help each other, "and that part of that "means we must be patient with our differences.
she also knows that it's only by giving that we gain the things that truly matter.
it's funny.
I'm her big sister, but often, I forget that.
because the truth is that most of the time, I look up to her.
sometimes, is everything okay?
Yeah. It will be.
I hope it will be.
this is the center's kitchen.
Yeah, annot in a good way. - No.
Hey, uh, ma, you know, this tile's kinda grotty.
you're just noticing the tiles?
that's easy to fix. I've got some great books on restoration and renovation.
you all can help me pick a look.
come on. - Yay.
this will be the heart and soul of the center--the great room.
if this is the great room, I'd hate to see the good room.
you know, you keep calling it "the center." It sounds like a cult.
you need to come up with, like, a proper name for this place.
Yeah, Nora, and make sure it's not cancer house.
how about ach motel?
all right, you guys. Everyone, stop.
you just need to have a little vision.
go with me on this.
okay, now we'll put a tv and some nice chairs over there, and then over there in that corner will be, like, a rec room with a ping-pong table and video games.
mom, what's with all the power tools?
uh, yes.
I-I met with a contractor who had the audacity to quote me $60,000 for interior demolition alone. - Ouch.
Yeah, so I thought maybe we could do it ourselves.
excuse me?
"we" as in we here in this room?
Oh, Sarah and Kitty will be joining us later, and that'll be great.
Tommy's out of town. It's really not that big a deal. Honestly.
I mean, we just need to, you know, knock out these two little wall things and some stuff back there, air it all out.
it's really just some basic demolition.
no, basic demolition is what we do to each other at dinner after we've had copious amounts of wine.
you can't mix that with power tools.
Plus, you know what? It's our day off.
and I don't know if you're familiar with the term. It actually means no work.
no. Work? No, no. Oh, this will be so much fun.
do you know how many calories you're gonna burn?
you know what? I think I'd rather take a spin class.
Nora, you said "tour." You said "architectural tour."
I said it would include a tour.
Oh, Saul, you and William built Ojai from nothing.
why can't we do that here?
build another family legacy, something that will live on way past us, something that doesn't include Holly.
I've never... done anything like this before.
I've never believed in anything so strongly.
this is my Ojai.
ma, you realize that Ojai wasn't built in a day, though?
Yeah, and you can't just knock down a wall.
you have to consider electrical, plumbing.
Oh, I have cons-- I have walked through this entire house with the contractor taking copious notes--bearing walls, electrical, plumbing.
I've put it all down here on the floor plan.
it's all marked.
it is...
guys, this isn't brain surgery.
so we believe this campaign captures the brand.
we'll launch with a mix of spread print, web banners and direct mail.
that's great, Chris. Thank you.
go ahead. Say what you think.
well, I think it's a great campaign.
I-I just-I'm not sure if it speaks to people like me.
I guess it just feels like it's more directed toward people who already know a lot about wine.
she means old people.
no, no. Uh, uh, sophisticated.
Oh, nice save.
the fact that four women can share an awesome bottle of our petite syrah for, what, $12, when you can't even get a cosmo for that at--at skybar?
I mean, we should capitalize on that, sell it as, you know, a girls'-night-out wine, a girls'-night-in wine.
but, you know, I also know that, you know, Tommy's a little bit more into the higher end customer.
no, Tommy's not here.
it's not a bad idea, Rebecca. - Not at all.
you know, we always need trend watchers, if you're ever looking for a part-time job.
Really? - Well, yeah.
I mean, if it's all right with my client. - By all means.
where are you?
I'm at home. Where are you?
Oh, Sarah. Sorry.
I thought you were my very demanding and very late husband.
okay, Kitty, I need a pep talk.
tell me I'm a brilliant businesswoman and I know what I'm doing.
I don't even know why I'm talking to you.
you hated the whole greenatopia proposal.
I was in a very bad place.
it's a good idea, right? You'd use greenatopia.
mom would use greenatopia.
why are you so out of breath?
I'm scrubbing my conference room, otherwise known as my kitchen.
we've got a meeting with a potential investor.
Oh, my god. There are corn flakes ground into my floor.
honestly, Kitty, who is gonna lk into my living room and take us seriously?
all right, Sarah, just listen to me.
you are brilliant, you are experienced, and you have a very good idea.
just stay calm.
stay calm. I know that.
Hey, have you seen my notes? I had them in my hand a minute ago.
dining room table, second chair on the left.
okay, Kitty, I gotta go.
Oh, gee. Nice talking to you, too.
Where'd you get that tie?
thrift store.
looks like it. Lose it.
I still think we should've rented conference room.
maybe we should just reschedule this.
Kyle, Danny Brown is gonna be here any minute.
we can't afford a conference room.
we can barely afford lunch.
besides, venture capital firms love frugality.
it shows them that we're only spending on what's critical, therefore maximizing potential profitability.
and it's a pretty good story for the business press.
that's right. I keep forgetting you're the one with the M.B.A.
don't forget it.
do you really think he's gonna invest?
I mean, we sent out 128 proposals and only got one hit.
one very big hit.
Phoenix is one of the biggest venture capital firms in california.
right, but just to clarify, if these guys decide not to invest, we have no backup plan, we're done.
okay, stop it with the negativity, both of you.
you have to be confident. Business is like dating.
Oh, no.
greenatopia has the potential to be incredibly lucrative.
I know that. You know that. - I do.
our job is to let him know that, and the key is to be calm.
I'm calm.
stay calm.
do you want me to-I should-okay.
ready? - Yeah.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, good. How you doing? - How are you?
I'm well. - Welcome. Thank you for coming.
my pleasure.
sorry we have to meet here instead of a conference room.
that's because we're frugal, and we love frugality.
uh, no, no, no, no, no. This is--this is not, um...
Graham. Hi, um, at are you doing here?
uh, well, my colleague Danny Brown couldn't make it, so, uh, here I am.
you're with Phoenix now?
Yeah, I've been with them for the last six months.
G--oh, great. That's great.
you look good. - You, too.
I'm sorry. Uh, so you guys... you--you know each other?
uh, yes, yes. This is Graham Finch.
we worked together briefly. Ethan Travis, Kyle Dewitt.
nice to meet you. - Kyle.
um, I shook your hand already. I don't know why...
so who'd like a coffee?
sorry I'm late.
I've been waiting for you for an hour.
I know. I got held up.
listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. - Okay.
you remember Mike in the Washington office?
Mike. Um, oh, yeah. Mike with the big teeth?
well, two months ago, they had these beautiful, amazing twins.
so I brought you the information on the service they used.
surrogacy.
what do you think?
I guess I've just really fallen in love with the idea of giving a child who's already here a home.
I know. Me, too, but what we've been through with adoption?
getting our hopes up and having Trish change her mind?
I-I don't want to go through that again.
well, neither do I.
with surrogacy, it's not even an issue. The child is ours, no questions asked.
it is clean, it is easy. We are completely in control.
look, honey, it's not like I haven't considered going down this route.
I just thought instead of waiting for somebody in the ether to choose us and then maybe backing out, - you know, it's something we should think about. - All right.
all right. I'll think about it. - Good.
Yeah. Oh, hey. Thanks for getting back to me.
we're talking about an eco-friendly company with an exciting revenue model.
you input your zip code, the product you want and voil?
we give you all your local options.
customer base is there. Everybody's dying to buy local.
that's fine, but we're not talking about funding a lemonade stand, okay?
see, in order for me to recommend that phoenix invest in your company,
I've got to know that there will be a minimum of a million views a month.
try a million a week.
and you know this, uh, how?
well, we've crunched some rough numbers.
right, and, uh, and now exactly, uh, uh, how, uh, did you crunch, and what numbers specifically?
what was the crunchulation factor in your crunchification?
it's all in there, appendix B.
let's not get bogged down in the testing methodology, Graham.
the starting demographics of a site like greenatopia are users with - an income average of between $150, 000 and $200, 000 a year. - right.
they're a web advertiser's wet dream.
this is a low-cost company with global growth potential.
not to mention, we might actually do some good for the planet.
you have not changed at all, have you?
a little older, a little wiser.
well, it doesn't show. I mean, the older part.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'm so sorry to interject here.
how exactly do you guys know each other again?
uh, well, Graham and I, uh, actually worked together briefly at Ojai.
uh, and I can attest that you guys are working with the best.
I mean, she's a royal pain in the ass, but she's the best.
coming from another pain in the ass.
but, uh, we're talking about greenatopia, not about me, so, um...
it is about you a little bit.
I have to, uh, confess that when I saw your name on the proposal,
I was more than happy to fill in for my associate.
Sarah, can we have a word in the conference room?
what's going on out there? It's like you two are in heat.
okay, full disclosure-- Graham and I did date briefly... - what?
in the past.
so he's here to get in your pants no. This is business.
okay, I'm sorry that we're having a reaction to this.
it's just that we have put the last two years of our life not to mention every single penny we have into this web site, and I am a little
no, no, scratch that-- I am hugely uncomfortable with the fact that we have one investor, and it's your ex sugar daddy.
Graham Finch is very good at what he does.
thank god, 'cause for a second there, I thought you were gonna tell me he was the one who almost flushed your family business down the toilet.
okay.
he was a small part of it.
okay, but he has an excellent track record.
more importantly, he has access to private equity funds, funds which we desperately need.
as far as I'm concerned, the fact that Graham and i know each other, - that could work for us. - How?
because he knows he can trust me, therefore, he can trust the company.
now you just have to trust me.
sorry to interrupt you. I've got another appointment across town.
listen, I'd love to hear more. Are you available for dinner?
definitely. - Absolutely.
Yeah. We'll set it up.
no, I-I pretty much got a handle on the, uh, the creative side.
I-I need to go over the financials with the C. F.O.
you good with that? - Uh, yeah.
no, I think it's, uh, I think it's a good idea.
good idea. - 8: 00?
great. - Okay. Sounds like a date.
sounds like a date.
it's an expression.
Oh, thank god you have answered.
look, Kevin, I can barely hear you.
Yeah, that's Saul manning the wet-and-dry vac.
Kitty, I am in the ninth circle of hell, okay?
mom has us all down at the center doing demolition.
she has lost her mind.
believe me, this is a disaster of herculean proportion.
she thinks we can do this all by ourselves, so please come down here, talk some sense into her.
Oh, you know what, Kevin? I have to call you back.
no, no, no! Don't
hello.
well, hi. Hi, Trish.
well, um, sure. No, sure. I-I have a little time this afternoon, yeah.
I really just wanted to say thanks as well, for letting me sit in on that meeting.
well, I should be thanking you.
really, I was impressed and proud.
Really?
I just--I really-- I really think I'm starting to get a sense for the wine business.
Oh, no, more than just a sense.
it's just so exciting, you know, from--from advertising and then meetings with the distributors, then all of a sudden, you're on the phone with a farmer about harvest yields.
it's just cool.
well, if you're interested, I could teach you.
Yeah, of course I am.
Becca. I think..that you should work here full-time.
are you serious? - Absolutely.
I mean, you obviously have a head for advertising.
you could focus on that and learn the other aspects of the business.
we could create a position for you here.
well... have you discussed this with Tommy?
I am the C.E.O. of this company, remember?
besides, Tommy will be thrilled.
I don't know what to say.
say yes. - Yes.
great. I-- this is gonna be great. Really.
okay, does anyone know how much asbestos is too much?
you know, in a few months when an actual family is living in this big, beautiful, warm, friendly home, you all are gonna so proud about all this hard work you're doing here today.
Oh, dear. - Oh, dear what?
well, it looks like you have a termite infestation.
since when do you know anything about infestations?
well, I used to work for a carpenter every summer when I was in high school.
I can chisel, drill and plane.
that is hot.
all right, look, Nora, this is it.
I think at this point, we should just reevaluate.
Yeah, mom, and maybe eat some lunch. - And you know what?
get some air, 'cause this dust is really giving me a migraine.
here. Take some aspirin. Eat a protein bar. Anything else?
a glass of pinot grigio.
so you--you-- you look bigger.
I mean, well, just your belly, not--not the rest of you.
Kitty, it's fine.
I actually lost sight of my feet about a week ago.
pregnancy milestone, I suppose.
but, uh, this baby-- sometimes it feels like it's wearing steel-toed boots.
is there like, a-- a lot of kicking?
Oh, yeah.
uh, Kitty, I called because, uh, I wanted to say to you, in person,I'm sorry.
for what?
changing my mind.
i-it was unfair to you and to robert.
you don't owe us an apology.
you had ever prerogative to reconsider, and robert and I knew that going in.
you know, the truth of it is, I st asked you too many questions.
Oh, god, you had every right to ask me as many questions as you wanted answers to.
mm, well, my mother even tells me that I can be overbearing at times.
no, Kitty, you were fine.
you just wanted to know that I had considered everything, and truth be told, I hadn't.
I didn't want to think about how I'd feel once the baby was born or if I'd regret it in a few years.
I was perfectly happy not to think about any of that.
but after a lot of soul-searching and, uh, some sleepless nights,I have to say, thanks to you...
I'm actually at peace with my decision.
I don't want to be a mother.
and, you know, Kitty, the more I thought about it, the more I realized what was right for me and this baby, and...
that's you and robert.
I know you have no reason to trust me, but...
if you still want to adopt this baby, I'd really love that.
it looks like this might be water damage.
Justin, would you concentrate on what you're doing? That thing looks rotten.
okay, I am concentrating, and if you know so much about it, why don't you come here and do it?
I can't because my spirit's broken.
I don't even know why I'm here anymore.
you're here to help families with sick children.
think about that when you work.
you know what? I don't think there's even any pipes near that section, not on the plans. Look. It must be just some sort of weird discoloration.
do you even know how to read plans?
Scotty! Scotty! Watch it!
for god sake, Justin! You almost killed him.
look, I'm sorry, Kevin! Are you all right, Scotty?
guys, guys, I'm fine.
I'm trying to achieve a state of zen.
thank you, Scotty.
I said I'm trying.
Hey, everyone. - Pizza!
I ran into the pizza guy out front.
so we have two veggie and two everything, and it's on me.
no, no, no, no. I ordered it. I'll pay for it.
no, no, um, I wanted to, because I just got a promotion.
wow, honey. Congratulations. - You did?
Thanks. I'm gonna be working in advertising at walker landing.
so basically I coordinate with the ad agency, oversee special projects.
that's huge, you know? - Yeah.
temp one day, exec the next?
Yeah, well, I mean, it's not that sudden.
no, and if Tommy feels you're ready, well, then I-I-I guess you are.
Yeah, yeah. Well, actually, he's out of town, but my mom thinks that it should be fine, so...
Yeah.
what's with all the looks?
I'm just hungry. - Starving.
Yeah, over here. Take this whole box right here. - You gotta admit, you're not exactly qualified for that.
about as qualified as you four are to do construction.
look, I didn't-- - it's a great house, Nora.
no, wait. You're not going are you?
well, seeing as I'm not qualified for my new job,
I should probably go home and brush up on my new responsibilities.
I didn't--Rebecca, I didn't mean it like
I'm going home. We'll talk later.
thank you for the pizza, Rebecca.
looks like you're staying at mom'S.
so, uh, how have you been? How's the family, you know, the kids?
they're good. - Yeah? You seeing anyone?
you cut right to it.
um, no. No, I'm not. How about you?
still got a girl in every city?
I cut back to, uh, cities with over two million residents - 'cause I'm not as young as I once was. - That's true.
so are we gonna keep flirting, or are we gonna talk about greenatopia?
I wasn't flirting, you were.
and yes, yes, let's talk about greenatopia.
I read the proposal, I went on the web site.
it's all very promising. - Good.
but I have to tell you, that's an awful lot of early money at this stage of the game.
so give me a figure.
a million to start, plus an additional three in the growth phase.
that's not too shabby. - No.
what's the catch? - There's no catch at all.
we'd just ask for 30% ownership, you'd be kicked up to C.E.O.
and we'd give Kyle and Ethan a-a happy exit.
this is their baby. They're--they're--they're not gonna want to sell out.
all right. You drive a hard bargain. We'll keep 'em on as cofounders.
I'm not sure they would accept a token offer.
this is their big idea.
it's a good idea, and, uh, there's no shortage of good ideas.
what there is a shortage of is people talented enough to execute those good ideas, and you're one of those people.
now if my firm is gonna make this kind of investment, we have to know that there'll be somebody who's responsible enough to oversee it--that's you.
now come on, you'd be making a competitive salary, full benefits package.
you'd have a conference room that doesn't have a-- a garbage disposal in it, okay?
this is a solid offer.
it's very tempting.
I'm willing to stake a million dollars of my firm's money on this, on you, because I know a good thing when I see it.
are we still talking about greenatopia?
I hope not.
that was nice. - That was presumptuous.
it was more than nice.
I'm not sure I can talk business after that.
me, too, which is exactly why you should jump on this while I'm vulnerable.
Oh, you know, look...
the boys are at home, anxiously awaiting to hear about the future of their company.
let me...mull it over, and I'll, uh, I'll get back to you.
what, no dinner?
I'm not hungry for food.
so she just calls you out of the blue?
Yeah, I-I was thrown, too, but--but I think that maybe it's a sign.
the only thing it's a sign of is how indecisive she is.
first she gives us the boot, now she's begging us to be the parents again?
she's not begging.
she's--she's just had some time to think it over, and she knows now that we're the ones.
we were the ones, and she pulled out.
Robert, I understand your reluctance. I do. But I'm--I'm... chills.
okay? Come on. You loved her before.
before.
look, this is just messy and complicated.
Oh, would you guys stop nay-saying?
the place isn't complicated and messy.
you haven't even walked through the house.
we're not nay-saying the house, mother.
Oh, although we're not not nay-saying it either.
is everything all right? - Everything's fine.
I heard that you needed reinforcements, and nothing makes me happier than keeping democratic bureaucrats waiting while I do a little honest work.
you're staying?
Yeah, yeah, ten minutes. It'll be fine.
the--the boys are upstairs pulling carpet.
careful, it's dark. - I live for pulling carpet.
Yeah, I won't be pulling any carpets.
are you sure everything's okay?
fine. - Great. Will you hold this?
I'm making a stack of all these. I don't want to miss this one over here.
you need these, though. It's just--hold that for one second.
now you've gotta collect all this stuff somewhere.
mom, mom, I am wearing a very expensive coat. - Just hold it for one second.
I'll get it.
W-where's ethan?
where he, uh, always is.
so, uh... tell me, how was, uh, how was dinner?
well, we, um... we got an offer.
Oh, my god. - Are you serious? How much?
a million dollars to start. - What?
$3 million when we're up and running.
dude!
you know, not to mention offices, you know, real offices, and, uh, health insurance, 401s, all the good stuff.
this is so fr--Sarah, I-I don't even-- I mean, thank you so much.
seriously, thank you so much. A million dollars?
so wait, what are the terms? - Boilerplate stuff.
they want to bring in their own company director. - Right.
standard. They did offer me C.E.O.
nice. - Nice. Congrats.
and they want to keep you guys on as cofounders.
cofounders?
um, I-I don't-- I don't even know what is-- what's--what--that--what does that entail, cofounders?
you'd be like the figureheads of greenatopia.
Figureheads?
don't get hung up on the title.
the thing is, your ideas would be considered-- strongly considered-- by management and the board.
we don't get a vote? - No.
but I do, and I guarantee that your ideas will be heard.
Sarah, no. This is our company.
you'll still be part of it.
only it won't be our company anymore.
I mean, that's what this is, right?
you get a great new job, and Kyle and I get what?
I mean, what are we, like, the taco bell chihuahua or something?
no, you would still have an enormous stake.
guys, this is good.
no, yeah, it's good for you.
you knew that wherever we took this, we'd have to compromise.
Yeah, of course, we know that, but we also know that you just essentially sold us out for a million dollars.
and a retirement plan. - And a retirement plan.
this is as good as it gets.
that's right, because the economy is in a tailspin and you've got a mortgage and an ex-husband and alimony and health insurance.
Yes, I have responsibilities, Kyle, and I'm proud of them.
okay, so the offer isn't perfect.
but it is the only offer we got, and I guarantee both of you that I negotiated us the best possible deal.
seriously, Sarah?
I'm--I'm not so sure anymore, you know?
I'm not so sureI trust that you negotiated the best terms possible for us.
I-- we don't have a choice anymore.
we've eaten through our savings.
we don't even have enough money to pay the rent past next month.
he's right. We got turned down by what, there was 127 other possible investors?
so we're gonna take this, right? We don't have a choice.
but come on, at least for a second, show us enough respect to not act like you didn't sell us out here.
I don't even know what to say to that.
I think you just say good night.
good night.
voil? here's your new office.
but this is Saul's old office.
do you think it's weird for me to be here?
I don't know. Uh, would you be more comfortable in Sarah's?
no, no. I'm--this is... thanks. okay. Thank you.
feel free to make yourself at home.
hang up some of your photographs or get some throw pillows.
what's wrong?
I don't know. Did you give me this job just because I'm your daughter?
because let's be honest. I mean, I don't-- I don't have any experience.
I'm giving you this job because you're smart and talented, and I think that you'll be an asset to this company.
but would I have given you this job if you weren't my daughter?
maybe not. But that's what people do.
that's what William did.
but I wouldn't be giving you this job if I didn't think that you were up for the challenge.
I opened the door. Now it's up to you.
thank you for being honest.
and I promise, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna do my very best.
I know you will.
this is so great, you and I here together, getting our hands dirty.
Yeah, this is good.
pulling out walls is much better than banging my head against the one that is my husband.
we're here to fix up this house, not to dismember your significant other.
Yeah, well, I can multitask.
Hi, honey. - Hey, Sarah.
well, this is nice, mom. - Yeah.
Oh, can I borrow this?
great. You know what?
if you start at the bottom and work your way up,
I think that's actually what works--well, that's good, too.
why does she get the sledgehammer?
greenatopia got offered a million-dollar cash infusion today.
no, seriously, mom. That's amazing. - Well, who gave you a million dollars?
no, no, don't-- don't answer that, Sarah, - Because she'll want to steal your investor for a donation. Yes, you would. - No, she-she--oh, stop.
honey, who gave you a million dollars?
are you and Graham still seeing each other?
no, mother. His firm's interested in the company.
so we had a meeting, we discussed the future of the company, and we had a drink and we kissed.
wow, that must have been a doozy of a kiss if you got a million dollars out of it.
it wasn't a trade, Kitty.
well, I-I don't understand, if you just made a million-dollar deal, why are you so upset?
I'm not upset, mother.
Kyle and Ethan are furious at me.
they think I tried to sell them out.
I try to make them rich, and now they hate me.
well, did you try to sell them out?
no, I made a necessary and financially lucrative business compromise.
they'll be thanking me when they're 40.
senator, a hand would be nice.
secretary of state trumps carpets.
wait, what are you doing here? You have to go.
what are you doing? We need him.
I'm doing my job.
look, it's okay. I can multitask.
good, then multitask away.
guys, here's the deal-- why don't we just open this window and throw the carpet out there?
that's leaded glass. It doesn't open.
that's the only decent thing in this dump. Do you really want to break it?
Yes. I'll pay for a new one.
I have never been more serious in my life.
I have no intentions of ever touching this carpet again.
Oh, mom!
is everybody okay?
uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're okay.
no. No.
mom, look...
I'm sure, um, you know, someone will be able to fix this.
I mean, you know, obviously not us... - Right.
a contractor. - I'm sure someone can, ma-maybe.
I could've killed myself. I could've killed one of you.
Oh, come on, mom. It's
no, no, this house is nothing but rotten wood.
you all tried to tell me-- the moldy walls, the collapsing ceiling.
I was just too stubborn to listen. I...
I thought we could save it-- our special family project, my...
Ojai foods. God.
how could I make such a colossal mistake?
mom. Mom. Hey, you know what? You're right.
this house is a-- well, it's a--it's a mess.
it's a complete and utter mess.
I just said that, Kitty.
Yes, you--you did, but you know what? Maybe that's okay. Maybe that's okay.
I mean, a lot of great things come out of messy, complicated situations because, you know, they're just meant to be, right?
well, yeah, but, you know, there's a lot to be said for clean, orderly, simple.
no, come on, Kevin. You love complicated.
You--why did you go to work for Robert?
well, because he didn't make partner. - What?
no, I wanted to make a difference.
right. Right.
because mom has always taught us, for better or for worse, that complicated things can--can be good.
Yeah. I get the argument.
right, of course you agree, because you ran for president.
nothing simple about that. And then there's Sarah.
Sarah is in business with 2 teenagers for god sake. - Oh, well, they're 28.
she goes out to dinner with her ex-boy toy, she kisses him and she gets a million dollars.
I mean, that's complicated.
complicated. - That's complicated.
you know what? Then there's Justin.
Justin's an addict, and he went to war.
okay, and then there's uncle Saul. I mean, that...
hello. - That is incredibly complicated.
Kitty, I so appreciate you trying to cheer me up, but it isn't
no, no. No buts.
you're not allowed to give up.
you're not allowed to give up because you believe in your gut that this is right.
and--and--and besides, we've--we've all inherited this--this-- this absurd drive to
to make things that--that, yes, they seem complicated and they're messy, but we can turn 'em into something great.
Yeah. - right?
right.
and if you give up, well, then there's just no hope for the rest of us.
don't give up
Oh, man.
thanks anyway, Kitty.
look, I know you can set this up.
I-I need a face-to-face as soon as possible.
so, um, could you give me a call? I, um...
well, I have something I just want to bounce off of you.
so... call me when you can.
thanks
everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
look, obviously, I work for you, but we don't always have to be so professional, okay?
we are related. I am your brother.
we just have an "in" and a "law" attached.
did Kitty tell you that I had brought up surrogacy?
I mean, with what we've gone through with the birth mother, it just think it's the simple, straightforward thing to do.
the baby would be ours legally and biologically.
so let me guess.
you'd rather a surrogate, Kitty wants Trish?
Yeah, exactly.
and look, I-I get it, if this goes well, we have a baby in three months.
but now Kitty's got feelings and she's got chills, and, I mean,
I'm willing to stand down, but if she's wrong about this...
look, take Kitty off the table for a moment.
what do you want?
I guess I don't know.
thanks for stopping by my office.
it's not gonna be your office for long.
Yeah. Listen, Graham, I just-- I...
I want to thank you for your faith in me...
and for being prepared to take a risk with greenatopia.
but you're backing out, right?
I'm backing out. - oh, boy.
Oh, man. I haven't even made a pass at you yet today.
pass or no pass, we can't accept your offer. I'm sorry.
look, I-I-if this is a negotiating tactic,
I actually do have a little wiggle room on the initial, uh, investment.
I'm not negotiating.
well, then this better be because you got a better offer.
it doesn't have to do with, uh, you know, mutt and jeff.
it's Ethan and Kyle. And yeah, actually, this is about them.
I don't want them to settle for a token role in a company they began.
you're gettin' soft, kid.
I'm not soft.
maybe a little bit.
I'm offering you a bird in the hand.
I know that, and it is very tempting.
but I--I've taken a risk with these guys-- probably the biggest risk of my professional career
because they inspired me to with their enthusiasm and their optimism, and I want to stay a part of that.
I can't sell them out because mr. Handsome walks in and offers me a salary with benefits.
so this is about the kiss, isn't it?
Oh, you're unbelievable.
Hey, no, no, you're the one who brought handsomeness into the conversation.
Yeah, as a side note.
Yeah, just so you know, I was looking for an excuse to look you up.
I know that.
I think about you.
graham, I'm flattered, but there was a reason that we didn't work.
well, I'm not asking for your hand in marriage.
I know that, too. But really, you know, what?
a fling?
you travel all the time, I'm rooted here.
well, I'm here now.
good-bye, Mr. Finch.
it was nice seeing you. - You, too.
just so you know, this is that one last
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
just do me a favor. Don't turn around yet. Okay?
what, did the rest of the ceiling cave in? - No.
did you find a family of possums living in the crawl space?
why are you dragging me in here? - Mom, mom, mom, be quiet, all right? Just be quiet.
do I at least get a cigarette and a chance to say my last words?
Oh, I-I think you're gonna owe us big-time for this one.
okay, Nora, turn around.
come on.
Oh, my god. What...
what is this-- what did you-- did you--did you
just a little something we whipped up this morning, that's all.
Yeah, when the ceiling came down, some plaster fell from the adjoining wall, and there it was.
it's amazing.
see, without you forcing us to demolish this place, we never would've found it.
all right, I'm keeping the house.
Oh, sweetheart, that's great news.
and you're gonna get an architect and a contractor.
Yes. - yes!
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, uh, uh, well, I'm just moving into my new office.
Did-didn't my mom tell you?
no, no. I... I haven't seen her yet.
well, she offered me, um, a position managing advertising.
you know, if you want to go talk to her, I can just go back to my desk and--and wait
no, no. No, no, no. She offered, you accepted.
seriously, congratulations. We're... we're lucky to have you.
Thanks. - Why wasn't I told?
I made an executive decision.
right, aside from the fact that I should've been consulted, how long has she been working here?
what, two, three months?
you know, Tommy, you're just gonna have to trust me on this one.
look, I trusted you when you said we couldn't afford Kevin's law firm.
I fired my brother.
and now you're offering your daughter an executive position?
it was your decision fire Kevin, not mine.
now I know that she is inexperienced, but she will learn on the job.
Sarah and I started out in the warehouse.
that's how we do it.
our employees start from the ground up.
Yeah, well, I have a different management philosophy than your father.
my father made this company a success.
this company is not your family business anymore.
well, you have made that very, very clear.
so take it to the boar let them decide.
that won't be necessary.
can I come in?
uh, yeah, of course.
nice office. This, uh, used to be Saul's, right?
uh, yeah. Yeah.
well, I got you an "I suck and I should've been more supportive/ office warming" present.
I don't even know if that exists, but here.
thank you.
Rebecca, I was wrong.
maybe it's easier to concentrate on your career than my lack of one. I...
but if this is something that you want, I'm really happy for you.
look, I know my mom gave me a big break here.
I really think that I could be good at this.
I know you'll be good at this.
well, on that note, I'm gonna let you work, because it's your first day and I don't want to get you fired, so bye.
thank you.
good news. We're still poor.
can I come in? - Yeah.
you were right.
greenatopia is your company, and you deserve to steer its future.
I'm sorry if you felt that I tried to sell you out.
I really want to be part of this.
I kind of feel like we're this band, you know, and you're the lead singer, and you signed with the big record label and you left the rest of the band high and dry.
you know, you screwed up. It's gonna be tough for us to trust you again.
Oh, come on. I brought pizza.
please.
so you really turned down a million dollars?
Oh, yeah--a million dollars, an actual salary, expense account, benefits and an ongoing sex life.
I could help you with that part.
I'm good for now. - Okay.
what I do want is a beer. - Done.
you good?
poverty.
there's the heart. - I think I see a hand.
right there, by the baby's head.
it's running for president.
it's--it's-- it's waving at us.
saying hi to mommy and daddy.
look, the baby's gonna turn now.
no wonder it feels like something's punching my cervix.
look at its little face.
would you two like to know the sex of the baby?
uh, no. No. I think we'll keep it a surprise.
Oh, god. It's... it's beautiful, huh?
okay, Tommy.
why am I being summoned here in the wee hours of the night?
can you sit down?
Where's Holly?
probably out celebrating Rebecca's new job.
Ah, yeah. Well, I heard.
so what, have you brought me here to-- to commiserate with you?
you're here to help me fix is.
Holly doesn't respect this company's history, she doesn't respect my position, my experience, nothing.
right. So what's the problem, Tommy? You tried to make it work.
well, obviously I can't.
look, I'm not gonna stand by and watch her seize control while she shuts us out.
my offer stands.
I will help you get her out.
good.
Oh, HI. YES, I WAS CALLING ABOUT THE STOKKE SLEEPI CRIB...THAT--THAT HAS THE-- -OH, HI. YEAH, THIS IS KEVIN WALKER FROM SENATOR McCALLISTER'S OFFICE.
the TODDLER BED CONVERSION KIT. -YES. KEVIN WALKER.
Yeah, I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE YOU HAD THAT IN CHERRY.
yes -YES. THANK YOU.
sorry, KEVIN, BUT THIS IS MY HOME, NOT YOUR OFFICE.
okay, THANK YOU.
the COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN'S UNION TODAY AT 4: 00 P. M.
you'll BE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT YOUR OPPOSITION TO OFFSHORE DRILLING.
that's A GOOD ONE.
Oh, LOOK. WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?
it WON'T HAVE AN IMPACT FOR YEARS,
and THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AREN'T WORTH IT.
don't YOU HAVE A BABY CARRIAGE OR SOMETHING TO BUY?
it's A CRIB, AND I'M ON HOLD.
look, I-I JUST GOT A LINK ONLINE FROM MY SON.
he WANTS ME TO TAKE HIM TO THE THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE.
your KIDS ARE COMING TO THANKSGIVING?
that's GREAT. MOM'S GONNA LOVE THAT.
uh, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE THING IS, KEVIN, IS THAT, UM...
we're NOT GONNA GO TO MOM'S FOR THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR.
that's IMPOSSIBLE.
not REALLY. ROBERT'S UNCLE JACK IS COMING
and ALL HIS COUSINS AND THE KIDS,
and--and WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE A THANKSGIVING DINNER HERE.
why DON'T YOU JUST TAKE THEM TO MOM'S?
it's JUST NOT THAT EASY.
we REALLY WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH SOPHIE AND JACK,
and, YOU KNOW, TALK ABOUT THE ADOPTION.
okay, ROBERT, ROBERT, DO Y THINK THAT MAYBE YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING?
uh, YOUR MOM CAN'T GET US EVERY YEAR.
look, I KNOW THAT. IT'S JUST... I'M NOT GOING EITHER.
you're JOKING. -NO, I'M NOT. LOOK, SCOTTY AND I WERE JUST MARRIED, OKAY?
and HE SPENDS EVERY THANKSGIVING WITH HIS FRIENDS IN PALM SPRINGS.
well--well, IS MOM OKAY WITH THAT?
SH--UH, SHE'S...I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET.
well, HOW DOES SHE FEEL ABOUT YOU BEING HERE?
well, NO, I-I-I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET, EITHER.
well, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
well, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
I THINK I ASK YOU FIRST.
no, I ASKED YOU FIRST! -ALL RIGHT, LOOK, -WAITER.
you're MOM'S GONNA HAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY WITH HER.
it's NOT LIKE SHE'S GONNA BE LEFT ALL ALONE, RIGHT?
Yeah.
we'll BE OKAY. -WE'LL BE FINE.
we're COOL. -YEAH.
we BETTER CALL JUSTIN. -YEAH.
all RIGHT, WHAT'S WRONG? WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME HERE?
what's THAT NOE? -HOLD ON. DAMN ON AND OFF SWITCH
okay. WHAT'S THE DEAL?
you--you're GONNA GO TO MOM'S FOR THANKSGIVING, RIGHT?
uh, THANKSGIVING. -Yeah, Thanksgiving. I'm sure you've heard of it.
it's THE HOLIDAY WITH PILGRIMS AND TURKEYS.
wait. WHAT--WHAT DO THEY WANT? -DID YOU TELL THEM THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOM'S FOR THANKSGIVING?
no -I heard that! -UH, FINE. WE'RE, UH, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOM'S -for Thanksgiving this year. -YOU HAVE TO!
Oh, that's impossible, Justin! -DON'T LET THEM PRESSURE YOU.
okay, LOOK, UH, REBECCA'S BEEN GETTING REALLY CLOSE TO HER MOM THIS YEAR, and she wants to go up to the winery, AND AS HER BOYFRIEND, I, UH...I'M GONNA GO, TOO.
Justin, let me tell you something.
Kevin AND I ARE GOING AWAY WITH OUR HUSBANDS,
and HUSBANDS TRUMP BOYFRIENDS.
wait A SECOND. YOU'RE NOT GOING, EITHER?
Oh, IT'S A FREAKIN' NIGHTMARE. -DO NOT FOLD, JUSTIN.
all RIGHT, LOOK, I MAY NOT BE MARRIED.
but YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW?
I'm vacuuming Rebecca's floor. Yeah. I'm deep in this.
we're a couple, and I'm sorry,
but THIS YEAR, IT'S ABOUT REBECCA AND HER MOM.
end OF DISCUSSION. -YES.
you HAVEN'T TOLD MOM YET, HAVE YOU?
it depends what you mean by "told.
okay, SO I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH MY MOTHER.
her PHYSICAL THERAPIST SAYS SHE HAS TO STAY COMPLETELY OFF HER KNEE FOR AT LEAST TWO MORE WEEKS.
it's GONNA BE ONE LONG MOTHER MARATHON.
it's OKAY.
Wow. YOU'RE BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.
well, I'D RATHER SPEND THE WEEKEND WITH YOUR DISAPPROVING PARENTS THAN SPEND ANOTHER HOLIDAY WITH MY EQUALLY DISAPPROVING BROTHER.
I THOUGHT YOUR FEUD WITH KEVIN WAS OVER. YOU GUYS SEEM FINE.
Yeah, IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN FAKING IT.
my MOTHER'S A TERRIBLE PATIENT.
and I'M KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT ELIZABETH.
she's BEEN REALLY CRANKY LATELY.
I THINK SHE HAD A FEVER LAST NIGHT.
Oh, GET THAT. I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON ELIZABETH.
Hello?
it's KITTY. -AND KEVIN.
and me, bro.
Oh, GOD. WHY DO I FEEL LIKE THIS IS BAD NEWS?
okay, HERE'S THE DEAL-- -We're not going to Thanksgiving this year.
who's "WE"?
all of us, and nobody's told Mom yet. -YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
what's GOING ON? -EVERYBODY PICKED THIS THANKSGIVING NOT TO GO,
and NOBODY'S TOLD MOM.
look, SHE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.
maybe-- -TOMMY WALKER! NO!
but you said your mom was gonna be in bed the whole time.
she MIGHT NOT EVEN MISS US.
give ME THAT.
all RIGHT, LISTEN UP, WALKERS.
in all the years I have been married to your brother, we have never gone to my parents' for Thanksgiving.
this TIME, WE ARE. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM.
you're adults. Stop worrying about your mother.
go OVER THERE AND TELL HER THE TRUTH.
you HAVEN'T TOLD MOM YET EITHER, HAVE YOU?
no. WE THOUGHT WE WERE THE ONLY ONES NOT GOING.
well, WE ALL DID.
look, WHY DON'T WE ALL TELL HER TOGETHER?
Oh, that's a great idea. Safety in numbers. -YEAH.
has, UH, ANYONE TALKED TO SARAH?
Oh.
you're ALL DEAD TO ME.
come ON! THIS--NOBODY DID THIS ON PURPOSE.
right, -YEAH. -YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE WE PLANNED THIS.
Joe's GOT MY KIDS, SAUL'S GONE TO GRANDMA'S FOR THANKSGIVING,
to FORM YOUR OWN LITTLE SATELLITE STATES LIKE A BALKAN UPRISING, AND MY NEIGHBOR FLIES TO TEXAS,
leaving ME WITH HIS GERIATRIC CAT.
now YOU JUST EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT'S... A COINCIDENCE?
Yeah. -YEAH. -YEAH.
I--I'm NOT GONNA DO IT. I'M DEPRESSED ENOUGH AS IT IS,
not HAVING MY KIDS FOR THE FIRST THANKSGIVING...
mom ALONE,
and A 30-POUND TURKEY WILL JUST SEND ME OVER THE EDGE.
mnh-mnh, I AM GOING MEWHERE, TOO.
where? -YEAH.
somewhere.
Sarah, I--I'M SORRY, BUT YOU CAN'T.
you WANT TO MAKE A BET? -WHAT ABOUT MR. FLUFFY?
right. -OH, GOD. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I'm HAVING THANKSGIVING ALONE WITH MY MOTHER -AND A DECREPIT CAT. -OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL
whoever DRAWS THE SHORT STICK HAS TO TELL MOM, ALL RIGHT? -OKAY.
Yeah! YES! ABSOLUTELY. -NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT DOING IT. I'M NOT DOING IT.
I'm NOT DOING THE STICK THING. -LADIES FIRST.
I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!
it's NOT FAIR! IT'S NOT FAIR! YOU ALWAYS CHEAT. -I'M OUTTA HERE.
Oh, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? -SARAH, YOU'RE THE BUFFER.
Ah, SARAH. SARAH. -NO, NO! WAIT, SARAH. -SARAH. SARAH. SARAH.
look, YOU GOTTA PUT A GOOD FACE ON THIS, RIGHT?
just--just ACT LIKE THIS'LL BE FUN.
you KNOW, IT'S YOU AND MOM HANGING OUT ON THANKSGIVING,
you KNOW, A COUPLE SINGLE GIRLS, LADIES' NIGHT, YOU KNOW?
that WAY, SHE WON'T FREAK OUT ON US.
looks LIKE, UH, SARAH COULD USE A FRIEND.
Oh, NO! NO, NO, NO, JUSTIN, YOU CAN'T--OH, THAT'S NOT
just 'CAUSE SHE'S, UH... -KEVIN! THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
wait A MINUTE! -WELL, AREN'T YOU COWARDS? -YOU AND MOM, A ONE-ON-ONE.
what EVER HAPPENED TO SAFETY IN NUMBERS?
you GUYS, COME ON, YOU CAN'T DO THIS...OH!
she's HERE! SHE'S HERE!
Shh. SHH! -SARAH?
the RECIPE IS... -OH.
mom's HERE. HEY, MOM. -HEY, MOM.
you're ALL HERE. WELL, THAT'S REALLY GREAT... -YEAH.
because I'VE GOT A CARLOAD FULL OF GROCERIES
you CAN HELP ME BRING IN-- PUMPKINS, CRANBERRIES, YAMS
and...
will YOU LOOK AT THIS TURKEY?
Oh! I HAD TO GO TO THREE STORES BEFORE I COULD FIND ONE...
big ENOUGH FOR OUR ENTIRE GROUP. OH, LOOK AT THAT!
you KNOW WHAT? WE--WE--WE DIDN'T REALIZE
you WERE GONNA DO ALL THE SHOPPING TONIGHT.
well, I WAS BUSY TODAY, AND IT'S MUCH LESS CROWDED IN THE EVENING, AND IF--YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL THE LAST MINUTE
because THE BIRDS GET ALL PICKED... OH, WHAT'S WRONG?
Mm. -KITTY.
okay, WE'VE--WE'VE-- WE--WE'VE ALL DECIDED TO GO AWAY FOR THANKSGIVING.
uh, SEPARATELY.
it's ACTUALLY KIND OF FUNNY IF YOU--IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
all OF YOU?
Oh, WELL, NO. NO, NO. NO. NOT--NOT SARAH. -YEAH, NO
Yeah, SHE'LL BE HERE--BE HERE WITH YOU. -IT'S JUST, KEVIN
it's A HORRIBLE COINCIDENCE, MOM.
so POOR SARAH GOT STUCK STAYING WITH ME.
what, DID YOU LOSE A BET OR SOMETHING?
no. NO, MOM.
actually, TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.
Ohh. -I MEAN, TWO SINGLE GIRLS...
too SWEET. -WE'LL BASTE, WE'LL ROAST, HANG OUT BY THE FIRE,
drink RED WINE-- IT'LL BE FUN.
that IS SO SWEET. -OH, SARAH, PLEASE DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
I--I'll BE JUST FINE WITHOUT YOU HOLDING MY HAND.
I'm JUST GOING OUT IN THE CAR TO GET THE REST OF THE USELESS GROCERIES.
Oh, LOOK, WAIT UP, MOM.
honestly, SARAH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
thank YOU. -THANK YOU.
I'm GONNA DUMP IT ALL IN THE TRASH. -GREAT.
you KNOW, SHE DIDN'T-- SHE DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
Yeah, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT WAS AIMED AT US, TOO.
no, KEVIN. AND THAT'S AIMED AT YOU!
Aah! THAT'S GOOD!
No! NO, SARAH! SARAH, NO. NO, I BRUISE--I BRUISE EASILY.
remember? SARAH, NO! AAH! OW!
yeah? -TOMMY, COME HERE.
Yeah. WHAT'S WRONG? -SHE THREW UP, AND THERE'S BLOOD IN IT.
she's SO PALE. -WE HAVE TO TAKE HER TO E. R. OKAY?
let's GO. COME ON, LET'S GO RIGHT NOW. -ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. SHH.
she's STILL RUNNING A FEVER
and HER LIVER FUNCTION TESTS ARE ELEVATED.
what DO YOU MEAN? WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER LIVER?
there's BEEN SOME CELLULAR DTRUCTION.
it's PROBABLY CHEMICAL IN ORIGIN.
since ELIZABETH WAS BORN PREMATURELY,
we ADMINISTERED HEAVY DOSES OF MULTIPLE DRUGS AT THE TIME.
any ONE OF THOSE COULD'VE CAUSED LIVER DAMAGE.
so... WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?
what WE'RE HOPING IS THAT ENOUGH CELLS REMAIN VIABLE
and THE LIVER CAN REGENERATE.
WE'LKEEP MONITORING HER FUNCTIONS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
please, WE JUST NEED YOU TO BE HONEST WITH US.
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE FACING.
if HER LIVER FAILS, SHE'S GOING TO NEED A TRANSPLANT.
Oh, GOD.
but PEDIATRIC LIVER TRANSPLANTS ARE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL.
we CAN TAKE A SLICE OF EITHER YOUR LIVER OR YOUR HUSBAND'S,
and IT WILL GROW IN HER BODY.
now ELIZABETH'S BLOOD TYPE IS "O," SO WE'LL TEST YOU BOTH.
one OF YOU HAS TO MATCH.
okay.
uh, WELL, WE'LL--WE'LL CROSS THAT BRIDGE WHEN WE GET TO IT.
I'm NOT, UM...
I'm NOT HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER.
we HAD SPERM DONATED. -I SEE.
one OF MY BROTHERS IS THE DONOR.
we JUST DON'T...
we DON'T WHICH ONE.
well... I THINK WE BETTER FIND OUT.
Oh, WOW. I THINK I HAVE BLISTERS.
yore THE ONE WHO WANTED TO LOSE 5 POUNDS
so YOU COULD GAIN IT BACK FOR THANKSGIVING.
how FAR DID WE RUN? -TWO MILES.
two MILES? THAT'S IT, TWO MILES? -YEAH.
that FELT LIKE 22.
Ah, IT'S TOMMY.
he FIRED YOU MONTHS AGO. GET OVER IT.
how WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF YOUR OWN BROTHER FIRED YOU?
I DON'T HAVE A BROTHER. STOP BEING SO CHILDISH.
you STOP BEING SO CHILDISH.
Hey.
if YOU GUYS DON'T TAKE SOME OF THIS FOOD,
it's ALL GONNA GO TO WASTE. HOW ABOUT SOME ONIONS?
mom, HOLLY ALREADY HAS ALL THIS STUFF.
well, HOW ABOUT A TURKEY? DOES SHE HAVE A TURKEY?
tell HER IT'S A GIFT FROM ME.
it's NOT USED. IT'S BRAND-NEW. IT HAS NO COOTIES.
it's MORE ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL COOTIES.
Oh, IT'S TOMMY.
Hey. YOU KNOW, WHERE IS TOMMY AND JULIA?
Hey, BRO. MOM SAYS HI. -THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME OVER THIS MORNING -and take some of this stuff. -HOW CLOSE IS MOM TO YOU RIGHT NOW?
there's, UH, SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU.
okay. UH, BUT WHY WOULD I NEED TO GO IN THERE?
Ah! Forget it. Just make up some excuse
as TO WHY YOU NEED TO LEAVE AND COME HERE to the St. Francis Hospital as soon as you can, all right?
whoa, WHY YOU AT THE HOSPITAL?
why IS TOMMY AT THE HOSPITAL? -Justin! I said don't react.
mo I--Mom! -Tommy, are you hurt?
I'm fine! It's nothing. Look, I need to talk to Justin.
Why? IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU?
I-I DON'T THINK SO.
wait, IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME?
No! LOOK, IT'S ELIZABETH, BUT SHE'S FINE NOW.
they're... THEY'RE DOING SOME TESTS.
Oh, MY GOD. -OH.
listen, Justin... -OKAY, UM...
I NEED ONLY YOU TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?
mom, MOM, HE JUST WANTS ME, OKAY? MOM
Tommy, honey, we're on our way. Don't worry.
sorry, TOMMY.
we JUST WANT TO FIND OUT AHEAD OF TIME, UH,
which ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE DONOR.
we're JUST TRYING TO BE PREPARED
if IT TURNS OUT THAT SHE HAS TO HAVE THE TRANSPLANT.
of COURSE. ANYTHING YOU NEED FROM US.
w--I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE ONE OF THEM?
I THOUGHT IT WAS A BLOOD TYPE ISSUE.
well, TEST ALL OF US, DON'T YOU THINK?
that's WHAT I AM. I'M A TYPE "O.
I-I'm, UH...I'M TYPE "O," TOMMY. -ME, TOO.
wait, YOU'RE BOTH TYPE "O"? -YEAH.
well, I CALLED IT FIRST... -MOM
so I-I REALLY THINK THAT I SHOULD BE THE ONE TO
mom, IT'S--IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
why NOT?
because LIVER TRANSPLANTS WORK OUT BETTER WITH THE PARENT.
let's GET A COFFEE. -YEAH.
come IN.
just HAVE A SEAT. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
thank YOU.
this IS GOOD. -WHAT?
that THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHO...
who'll BE ABLE TO HELP.
Yeah.
uh, WILL IT...
will IT BOTHER YOU TO KNOW WHO'S ABLE TO HELP?
not REALLY.
Yeah, ME NEITHER.
you THINK IT'LL BOTHER TOMMY?
it's NOT LIKE HE DOESN'T KNOW IT'S EITHER YOU OR ME.
Yeah, THAT'S TRUE.
pretty SURE HE WANTS IT TO BE ME, THOUGH.
Wow. TRULY DELUSIONAL.
well, I MEAN, KEVIN, LET'S FACE IT.
I HAVE BETTER HAIR, AND YOUR NOSE ON A GIRL?
tragic. -DO YOU WANNA TALK S. A.T. SCORES, PRETTY BOY?
okay, MR. WALKER. -YEAH.
Oh. YOU'RE BOTH GETTING GENETIC TESTING? -YEAH.
how LONG WILL IT BE FOR US TO GET THE RESULTS?
depends ON HOW BUSY THE LAB IS. PROBABLY A FEW HOURS.
if YOU'RE A HURRY, I CAN PUT A RUSH ON IT.
No! NO. YEAH, TAKE YOUR TIME. -NO! THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU.
I MEAN, THIS IS--THIS IS PRETTY MUCH PRECAUTIONARY.
we--we PROBABLY WON'T EVEN NEED 'EM AT ALL.
Yeah, IF--IF THINGS G0 THE WAY WE HOPE THEY WILL, -THIS'LL ALL BE MOOT. -MOOT.
moot? -YEAH.
right.
they've BEEN IN THERE FOR OVER AN HOUR.
no. NO, THANKS. -OH, FOR GOD SAKE, MOM. WOULD YOU SIT DOWN?
as MUCH AS YOU'D LIKE TO WORRY, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
God, I WISH I COULD DO THIS MYSELF.
well, YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE NOT HER MOTHER.
U're HER GRANDMOTHER, AND THEREFORE YOU HAVE A MUCH OLDER AND LESS DESIRABLE LIVER.
there, I SAID IT. -YES, YOU CERTAINLY DID.
I WONDER WHAT KEVIN AND JUSTIN ARE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN, THEY'RE--THEY'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHO-- -WHO THE FATHER IS.
no, TOMMY IS ELIZABETH'S FATHER, SARAH.
you KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
no, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, SARAH.
I'm SORRY, BUT WORDS MATTER.
well, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL THEM--SPERM DONORS?
well, I--WELL, OKAY, FINE.
all RIGHT, FINE. I'M SORRY. I DON'T THINK
I GUESS I'M JUST... A LITTLE OVERLY SENSITIVE TO THE WHOLE -NATURE VERSUS NURTURE THING. -SORRY. I'M SORRY. I WON'T--I WON'T
no, HONESTLY, GUYS, STOP. YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.
I MEAN, WE HAVE TO TRY TO BE SENSITIVE
to WHAT TOMMY IS GOING THROUGH. KNOWING TOMMY, IT'S A LOT.
I MEAN, HE'S ALWAYS SEEN THIS AS HIS OWN PERSONAL FAILURE.
Hey.
I KNOW. HE HAS-- -UH, HEY.
what's GOING ON? -HI.
not MUCH. WHAT'S HAPPENING? -IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
everything's FINE. UH, JUSTIN AND KEVIN ARE JUST FINISHING UP,
so THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO DO BUT WAIT.
we're JUST SEEING IF--IF SHE'S GONNA GET BETTER ON HER OWN.
so I THINK IT'D BEST IF YOU GUYS WENT HOME AND RELAXED. AND IF THERE'S ANY NEWS -I'LL--I'LL CALL YOU. -NO, I RE--I REALLY WANNA STAY WITH JULIA
her FAMILY'S NOT HERE. -MOM, JULIA IS FINE.
besides, WE MIGHT NEED YOU TO BE STRONG LATER.
so SITTING HERE ALL DAY AND NIGHT ISN'T GONNA HELP.
Tommy, ELIZABETH IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
I'm SURE OF IT.
I KNOW, MOM. I KNOW.
let's GO. -ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING.
no, I-- -YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL ME.
you MUST BE FREAKING OUT.
mm, NOT REALLY. THIS IS ABOUT ELIZABETH.
you KNOW, WHICH SPERM CELL GOT THERE FASTEST YEARS AGO
isn't THAT IMPORTANT.
unless IT WAS YOURS.
you KNOW WHAT? SO WHAT. I HAVE A LITTLE SURGERY.
you KNOW, NO BIG DEAL. I'VE BEEN SHOT AT, REMEMBER?
I MEAN, ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,
this SURGERY'S LIKE A ONE.
and IF YOU'RE THE FATHER, IT'S WHAT, LIKE A TWO?
she HAS A FATHER. HIS NAME IS TOMMY. HE RAISES HER.
I KNOW, BUT... I MEAN, I WASN'T RAISED BY MY FATHER,
and I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE OBSESSING OVER WHO HE WAS.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE
you NEED TO PRETEND IT--IT'S... IT DOESN'T MATTER, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, LOOK, EVEN IF I'M LIVING IN SOME CRAZY DENIAL WORLD,
like, I'M OKAY WITH IT. I MEAN, BEING A FATHER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO TOMMY,
and I DON'T WANT TO THINK OR--OR FEEL ANYTHING
to GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.
I KNOW, AND THAT'S GREAT, AND YOU'VE BEEN AMAZING.
I JUST... I HOPE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
that ONCE THIS GETS OUT OF THE BOTTLE,
you CAN'T PUT IT BACK IN.
let's NOT GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES, ALL RIGHT
I MEAN, ELIZABETH STILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET BETTER ON HER OWN.
let's JUST HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO LET THIS OUT, YOU KNOW?
Yeah, WE'RE ALL OUT IN THE BACKYARD.
the--the KIDS WERE ASKING WHERE YOU WERE. -Maybe you shouldn't tell them.
I DON'T WANT THEM TO WORRY OR ANYTHING.
okay. HOW ARE YOU?
uh... YEAH. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY. I'M...
I DON'T KNOW. I'M ACTUALLY FEELING A LITTLE WEIRD.
I think this whole thing is--is pushing buttons in me.
Yeah, well, I guess it'd be weird if it didn't.
but I THINK EVERYTHING'LL BE OKAY.
hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I HOPE SO. EVERYBODY'S HERE.
everybody's BEING SO SUPPORTIVE.
it's--it's ODDLY NICE.
Kitty, I-I CAN'T COME THERE.
I HAVE A HOUSE FULL OF RELATIVES.
Robert, IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.
I'm T TELLING YOU TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY.
I'm just-- -I'M SORRY. LOOK, WILL--WILL YOU CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME?
I will. I'll talk to you later Bye. -BYE.
I TOLD YOU IN MY MESSAGE
you DIDN'T NEED TO CUT YOUR TRIP SHORT.
we DON'T KNOW ANYTHING YET.
first OF ALL, YOUR MOTHER COULDN'T DRAG HERSELF AWAY FROM HER DOMINOES TOURNAMENT TO EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE MY PRESENCE.
I DON'T EVEN THINK THAT SHE NOTICED WHEN I LEFT.
second OF ALL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED ME MORE THAN SHE DID.
Ugh. GOD. I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I NEED TO TAKE A SHOWER AFTER DOING THIS.
well, I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU, KIDDO,
but YOU CAN GET PUMPKIN PIE FIING IN CANS THESE DAYS.
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO WEAR YOURSELF OUT
cooking A MEAL THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN GET EATEN.
you KNOW WHAT?
after ELIZABETH'S TESTS COME BACK AND THEY'RE NORMAL
and SHE DOESN'T NEED SURGERY,
we're ALL GOING TO BE VERY THANKFUL... AND HUNGRY.
and THIS IS WHAT HUNGRY, THANKFUL HAPPY FAMILIES EAT.
and IT'S GOING TO BE READY.
if YOU COOK IT, THEY WILL COME?
I COOK IT, AND THEY'LL FORGIVE ME.
what, NORA?
What--what DO YOU THINK YOU NEED TO BE FORGIVEN FOR?
Oh, I DON'T KNOW. I BEHAVED BADLY.
I GOT MAD AT EVERYONE
because THEY ALL MADE THEIR OWN PLANS FOR THANKSGIVING,
and I JUST SELFISHLY WANTED THE WHOLE FAMILY TOGETHER HERE, LIKE ALWAYS.
and NOW EVERYBODY IS HERE,
and I JUST WISH THEY WERE ALL MILES AND MILES AWAY
and SAFE AND SOUND AND... HEALTHY.
you're A VERY POWERFUL WOMAN,
but YOU DIDN'T CAUSE THIS AND YOU CAN'T FIX IT.
I FEEL SO USELESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF.
Oh, SWEETHEART.
you KNOW WHAT TO DO.
you DO WHAT YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE
you COMFORT THEM, YOU SUPPORT THEM,
you LET THEM KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE THEM.
and THEN YOU BAKE A PUMPKIN PIE FROM SCRATCH.
isn't IT GOOD THAT I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM ALBUQUERQUE JUST TO GIVE YOU THIS INVALUABLE ADVICE, HMM?
Yes.
and NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, WE'RE GOING TO NEED ONE MORE PIE.
so I THINK YOU SHOULD SCOOP THIS.
no, I DON'T SCOOP.
Yeah, YES, YOU DO.
Oh, NO, I DON'T! - YOU SCOOP.
this HOSPITAL HAS THE WORST FOOD. I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN FOOD.
it's SOME HORRIBLE FACSIMILE OF FOOD.
don't BE TOO HARD ON IT.
it MAY BE MY LAST MEMEAL...
or JUSTIN'S.
that's NOT FUNNY, BRO. - NO.
I WAS-- - THERE YOU ARE.
uh, LISTEN, I JUST SPOKE TO THE DOCTORS,
and, UM,
she NEEDS THE TRANSPLANT.
Oh, GOD. TOMMY, ARE YOU OKAY?
Yeah. I'M FINE.
everything's FINE.
Kevin, IT'S YOU.
Really?
Yeah. - OKAY.
um, THEY WANNA RUN SOME MORE TESTS,

Yeah. SURE.

I'll, UH, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
Yeah. - OKAY.

Nope. GO FISH.
I HATE THIS GAME.
Justin, WHAT'S A PAINTING BY DEGAS OR A LIQUEUR?

can't PEOPLE KNOW THINGS?
you HAVE ANY 7s? - YES.
here, YOU WIN. I QUIT.
why DON'T YOU TWO GO HOME?
I JUST WANNA STAY AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
Hey.
um, I'M GONNA GO HOME AND GET SOME STUFF FOR KEVIN.
Oh, NO, NO. LET ME GO.
you STAY HERE. - OH,
Oh, NO, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING.
well, I'LL FIND IT IF YOU TELL ME WHERE IT IS.
uh, JUSTIN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS COME WITH ME?
I JUST TOLD YOU I WANNA STAY.
well, JUST GO OUT FOR A WALK THEN. - YEAH, JUSTIN, LET'S GO FOR A WALK.
I DON'T WANT A WALK, OKAY?
I WANT ANOTHER BAG OF CHIPS.
um...
well, THANKS.
I'll--I'll MAKE A LIST FOR YOU. - OKAY.
how MANY OF THOSE CAN YOU EAT?
look, I DON'T KNOW, MOM. WE'LL SEE.
I'm SORRY.
I JUST FEEL SO BAD FOR ELIZABETH AND WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH.
ma, SHE'S NOT EVEN 2 YEARS OLD.
I KNOW.
what ARE YOU GOING THROUGH, JUSTIN?
What--what ARE YOU FEELING?
are YOU--YOU DISAPPOINTED IT'S KEVIN?
disappointed? NO.
are YOU RELIEVED?
no.
Yes, I'M RELIEVED AND YES, I'M DISAPPOINTED.
ma, I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M FEELING, OKAY?
the ONLY THING I DO KNOW IS THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.
Hi.
Hi. - OH, LOOK, SARAH.
this ROOM IS LOVELY.
Hi. I WOULDN'T KNOW, MA.
it's PRETTY HARD TO SEE THROUGH THE FOREST.
Oh, WELL, HONEY, JUST PUT IT DOWN OVER THERE.
Oh! HEY.
Where's KEVIN? - RIGHT HERE.
Hi, HONEY. HOW YOU DOING? - HEY!

it's OKAY. - HERE'S YOUR iPod.
thank YOU. - OH, THAT'S GREAT.
now WE CAN LISTEN TO SHOW TUNES ALL NIGHT.
whatever KEVIN WANTS.
okay, I'M ORDERING CHINESE.
I CAN'T EAT ANYTHING.
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA ORDER EVERYTHING WITH SHRIMP
because YOU'RE ALLERGIC.
how THOUGHTFUL. - I DON'T THINK I COULD EAT A THING.
my STOMACH IS DOING FLIP-FLOPS. - YES, I'D LIKE TO PLACE AN ORDER, PLEASE.
one SHRIMP LO MEIN,
one SPECIAL FRIED RICE WITH SHRIMP. WHAT DO YOU WANT, JUSTIN?
uh, BEEF WITH BROCCOLI.
two BEEF AND BROCCOLI WITH SHRIMP.
Sarah, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ORDER EVERYTHING WITH SHRIMP.
I'm NOT EVEN HUNGRY.
no, THAT'LL BE A PICKUP. THANK YOU.
when ARE THEY TAKING YOU IN IN THE MORNING?
Ugh, SOME AWFUL HOUR LIKE 5: 00.
Kevin, I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS INCREDIBLE.
I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE SO BRAVE.
well, YOU'RE NOT A MORNING PERSON, HONEY.
no, KEVIN.
you're BEING AMAZING. - I AM AMAZING.
Hi, TOMMY.
Hey, TOMMY. YOU HUNGRY? I JUST ORDERED CHINESE.
you CAN HAVE, UH, SHRIMP, SHRIMP OR SHRIMP.
well, YOU MUST BE HAPPY, MOM.
why ON EARTH WOULD I BE HAPPY?
everybody's HERE, TOGETHER FOR THANKSGIVING,
just THE WAY YOU WANTED IT.
Tommy, THAT'S NOT FAIR.
well, THEN STOP TREATING THIS LIKE ONE OF YOUR DINNER PARTIES.
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T ANOTHER WALKER FAMILY GET-TOGETHER.
Tommy, THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DOING.
just ENJOY YOUR DINNER.
Hey.
I HOPE THIS WORKS.
it WILL.
it HAS TO.
Shh.
okay.
are YOU ASLEEP?
no. ARE YOU? - NO.
wow, YOU LOOK LIKE
you're IN THE FIRST-CLASS CABIN OF SWISH AIR.
seeing AS I'M AWAKE, I MIGHT AS WELL SIGN SOME OF THESE FORMS.
can YOU PASS ME THAT PEN, PLEASE?
thank YOU.
what ARE THEY FOR?
everything. THIS ONE'S AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT.
payment? YOU'RE GIVING THEM A PIECE OF YOUR LIVER.
isn't THAT ENOUGH? - OH, NO.
no GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED.
informed CONSENT.
they WANNA MAKE SURE I'M AWARE OF ALL THE RISKS INVOLVED,
which INCLUDE...
loss OF LIMB FUNCTION, PARALYSIS, STROKE, BRAIN DAMAGE,
HEMORRHAGE-- - OKAY, GOOD.
thank YOU. MOVING ON.
hopefully I'LL JUST END UP WITH A SCAR AND NOTHING ELSE.
well, I LIKE SCARS. I THINK THEY'RE SEXY.
this ONE NEEDS TO BE NOTARIZED.
notarized? WHAT IS IT?
power OF ATTORNEY.
well, YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY.
not IF I'M ON LIFE SUPPORT, AND AS MY HUSBAND,
you'd BE IN CHARGE OF PULLING THE PLUG OR NOT.
okay, THIS IS ALL STARTING TO GET A LITTLE TOO, UM...
real.
Yeah, I MIGHT SIGN THAT ONE IN THE MORNING.
it's A GOOD THING WE ARE MARRIED.
if IT WAS UP TO MY MOTHER, SHE'D NEVER PULL THE PLUG,
and I'D BE A VEGETABLE FOR ALL ETERNITY.
it's NOT FUNNY, KEVIN.
I KNOW IT'S NOT FUNNY. BUT PLEASE DON'T GET SERIOUS ON ME NOW.
we HAVE THE WHOLE OPERATION TO GET THROUGH.
I'm SORRY. I'M JUST...
I'm SCARED.
I KNOW.
come HERE.
everything IS GONNA BE FINE. I PROMISE YOU.
I KNOW.
come HERE.
Oh.
what TIME IS IT?
it's REALLY EARLY. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO BACK TO BED.
mm, I'M UP ALREADY.
want SOME BREAKFAST?
uhUh, NO. I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY, BUT THANKS.
and THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SLEEP OVRE HERE.
Rebecca, IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO.
it ALWAYS WILL BE.
Oh, MY GOD.
I HAD CRAZY DREAMS ALL NIGHT.
you WERE IN ONE JUSTSTIN WAS IN ONE,
and THERE WERE BABIES ALL OVER THE PLACE.
mm, PROBABLY EVERYTHING FROM BEING AT THE HOSPITAL.
Yeah.
you KNOW, I WAS THINKING, MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HIM.
who? JUSTIN?
no. DAVID.
well, HE'S MY DAD.
I KNOW WHO YOU MEANT.
how DO YOU DO IT?
how DO YOU JUST PRETEND LIKE HE DOESN'T EXIST?
I KNOW HE EXISTS. I'M JUST GLAD HE DOESN'T EXIST HERE.
Yeah, BUT HE LEFT BECAUSE OF ME,
because I WANTED TO STILL BE A WALKER.
Yeah, THAT'S ONE REASON HE LEFT.
why ARE YOU SO CYNICAL ABOUT HIM?
because HE WOULD'VE FOUND ANOTHER REASON TO GO.
that IS JUST HIS NATURE, BECCA.
I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR 25 YEARS,
and HE CAN'T BE IN ONE PLACE AND HE CAN'T BE WITH ONE PERSON.
I KNOW
that THIS HAS OPENED UP A LOT OF WOUNDS.
but HE IS NOT THE ONE TO FIX IT.
he CAN'T.
sweetie,
I'm SORRY, BUT HE WOULD ONLY LET YOU DOWN.
Oh, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING.
I SHOULD BE HOME MAKING STUFFING FOR THE TURKEY,
not WAITING FOR MY SON AND MY GRANDBABY TO GO INTO SURGERY.
Nora, COME ON. WE'RE LUCKY THEY'RE HAVING SURGERY.
it's ONLY GONNA SAVE ELIZABETH'S LIFE.
Oh, I KNOW, I KNOW. LOOK, LOOK,
when THEY ROLL KEVIN OUT, LET'S JUST GIVE HIM SOME ROOM.
we DON'T WANT TO SCARE HIM.
Oh, HERE HE IS. HERE HE IS. - OKAY.
Oh, HERE HE IS.
is--is HE UNDER YET?
he's ON A DRIP. HE'S HIGH AS A KITE.
there HE IS. - UH-OH. HERE HE IS.
Oh, THE WHOLE FAMILY IS HERE. THAT'S SO NICE.
sweetie, IT'S GONNA BE OVER BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. JUST RELAX.
mom, THEY SHAVED MY CHEST. I LOOK LIKE MICHAEL PHELPS.
Oh, I THINK HE'S PRETTY RELAXED.
honey, I'M GONNA BE THE FIRST PERSON YOU SEE - WHEN YOU WAKE UP, OKAY? - OKAY.
just TELL 'EM TO TAKE A LITTLE OFF THE SIDES.
whatever YOU WANT.
okay, GOOD LUCK. - BYE-BYE, BRO.
Bye, KEV.
Bye.
Hey. - HEY.
Julia ASKED ME TO BRING YOU THAT.
Yeah, DID SHE, UH,
tell YOU TO BRING ME A DECAF?
uh, YEAH.
trade ME?
I JUST--I COULDN'T SIT IN THAT ROOM ANYMORE.
I MEAN, IF ONE MORE PERSON ASKED ME HOW I WAS FEELING,
I THOUGHT MY HEAD WAS GONNA EXPLODE.
no. NO.
so AT THE RISK OF A-- OF AN EXPLOSION, HOW...
how ARE YOU FEELING?
I'm FINE.
Oh.
what, KITTY? WHAT?
you WANT ME TO SAY
the DOCTOR'S SAY IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT, SO
well, I'M SURE IT WILL, TOMMY, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE FINE.
y-you DON'T HAVE TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS FROM ME.
I PROBABLY UNDERSTAND A LOT MORE THAN YOU THINK DO.
I DOUBT IT.
okay, WELL, LET ME TAKE A WILD GUESS.
what YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ANGRY
because FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON,
Kevin CAN FATHER A CHILD AND YOU CAN'T.
and NOW AFTER EVERYTHING YOU' BEEN THROUGH WITH ELIZABETH,
the ONE THING THAT SHE NEEDS THE MOST,
you CAN'T GIVE HER, BUT KEVIN CAN.
and WHAT REALLY SUCKS IS THAT DEEP DOWN,
you--you RESENT HIM FOR IT.
and WHAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE IS THAT EVEN DEEPER DOWN,
you're SICK OF THIS-- THIS, UH, GRUDGE THAT YOU GUYS ARE CARRYING ON,
and YOU REALLY, REALLY MISS YOUR BROTHER.
you KNOW, TOMMY, I REALLY WANTED TO BE PREGNANT.
and I WOULD--I WOULD THINK-- I WOULD THINK,
well, H-HOW DO PEOPLE LIKE TRISH JUST GO OUT,
they DON'T EVEN WANT KIDS, THEY HAVE A ONE-NIGHT STAND,
and IS IMMEDIATELY PREGNANT.
and OF COURSE I'M,
you KNOW, I'M VERY GRATEFUL
that SHE'S BRINGING OUR BABY INTO THE WORLD,
just AS YOU'RE GRATEFUL TO KEVIN, BUT IT
it's JUST THAT-- THAT LITTLE PART OF YOU THAT
that THINKS IT'S NOT FAIR.
maybe YOU DO UNDERSTAND.
eh, JUST, YOU KNOW...
Yeah, BUT, UH,
you WON'T-- YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING, WILL YOU?
Oh, I WON'T IF YOU WON'T.
good.
Tommy, IT'S OVER.
she's IN RECOVERY. KEVIN, TOO.
what DID THE DOCTOR SAY?
she SAID IT WENT FINE. THAT'S ALL SHE SAID--FINE.
we'll KNOW MORE IN TWO DAYS, BUT SHE'S, UM,
gonna WAKE UP SOON, AND WE CAN SEE HER.
fine IS GOOD, RIGHT?
FI-FINE IS VERY GOOD.
Oh, GOD.
the DOCTOR TOLD ME ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS.
Yeah, SHE SAID HER TEST RESULTS LOOK REALLY GOOD.
no SIGN OF ORGAN REJECTION SO FAR,
and THEY UPGRADED HER CONDITION FROM FAIR TO GOOD.
I KNEW SHE'D BE ALL RIGHT. I JUST KNEW IT.
but I'M SO RELIEVED.
Oh, HONEY.
look AT HER--HER COLOR IS SO MUCH BETTER.
Yeah. - I KNOW.
Julia GAVE HER SOME JUICE EARLIER,
and THEY'RE GONNA START HER ON SOLID FOODS TOMORROW.
and WHEN DO YOU TWO START ON SOLID FOODS?
I MEAN, YOU'RE DISAPPEARING.
Yeah, IT'S THE SICK BABY DIET. WORKS LIKE A CHARM.
when's THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A DECENT MEAL?
honestly, UM...
I DON'T KNOW.
well, LET'S JUST GO AND GET SOME FOOD INTO THE BOTH OF YOU.
look, YOU GO. I'LL STAY.
no, YOU GO. I'LL STAY.
I've GOT THIS GREAT IDEA. WHY DON'T THE THREE OF US GO?
we'll GET A NURSE TO STAY HERE.
she'll COME FIND YOU IF SHE WAKES UP,
and THEN YOU CAN HAVE A MEAL TOGETHER FOR A CHANGE.
what DO YOU THINK?
okay.
yeah? - YEAH.
Yeah, LET ME JUST...
uh, MOM...
about THE OTHER DAY, I'M...
I'm SORRY I YELLED.
what? I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I REMEMBER MY SON BEING WORRIED SICK ABOUT HIS BABY DAUGHTER.
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY YELLING.
yelling? DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
what?
Oh, MY GOSH. - WOW.
here THEY ARE. - OH, MY GOD.
it's THANKSGIVING. - YEAH.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS.
well, WE DECIDED THE BIRD WAS AMBULATORY,
so WE DRESSED HIM UP, DROVE HIM IN.
Hey, GUYS. SORRY, SORRY I'M LATE,
but HERE IS THE LIME JELL-O WITH WALNUTS AND BANANAS.
and I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH THANKSGIVING,
but I'M--I'M NOT GONNA EAT IT.
I THINK IT ACTUALLCOMES, LIKE, FROM EARLY COLONIAL TIMES,
it WAS SOMETHING WITH, UH, - SOMETHING TO DO WITH SCURVY. - OH, - IT'S JUSTIN'S FAVORITE IS WHAT IT IS. - I, YOU KNOW--YEAH.
Kitty, IT WAS VERY NICE FOR ROBERT TO COME.
Oh, COME ON, SAUL. DON'T BE SARCASTIC.
he's GOT HIS WHOLE FAMILY IN TOWN, - AND-- - EXCUSE ME.
I WASN'T BEING SARCASTIC. IT WAS VERY NICE FOR ROBERT TO COME.
Oh.
Robert. - OH, HEY.
Hi. - HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
you DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.
Yes, I DID. I MISSED YOU.
Mm. ARE YOU, UH, - ARE YOU HUNGRY? - YES.
so, UH, HOW'S KEVIN DOING? I-I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM TODAY.
Oh, YOU KNOW, HE'S GRUMPY WHEN HE'S AWAKE
and HE MOANS WHEN HE'S ASLEEP, WHICH HE'S DOING RIGHT NOW.
everybody GRAB A CHAIR
and ASSUME YOUR USUAL POSITIONS.
Oh, EXCEPT FOR JUSTIN.
we DECIDED TO LET YOU SIT AT THE BIG PERSON'S TABLE THIS YEAR.
no.
Yes. I MADE IT.
uncle SAUL, I MADE IT. - NO, NO, NO, NO.
you AWAKE?
Yeah.
how's IT GOING?
Oh, YOU KNOW, I'M ON A MORPHINE DRIP,
so I CAN'T COMPLAIN, BUT GOD...
I KEEP THINKING...
what IF IT HAD BEEN JUSTIN?
well, AS SOON AS HE HEALED, WE WOULD'VE HAD AN INTERVENTION.
we MIGHT STILL NEED ONE, THE WAY I'M ENJOYING THIS.
you KNOW...
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
me, TOO.
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
there's JUST SOMETHING, - YOU KNOW? - I KNOW,
but THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING EITHER.
I KEEP WONDERING WHAT DAD WOULD THINK OF ALL THIS.
I IMAGINE HE'D BE VERY HAPPY.
no, NO, I MEANT...
us.
we HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING ALONG, WE BOTH KNOW WE'VE BEEN FAKING IT.
dad's NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR PROBLEMS.
I'm SORRY I FIRED YOU.
I REALLY AM. - IT'S OKAY.
no, IT'S NOT,
because I PUT BUSINESS FIRST. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FIGURED OUT?
that's BAD FOR BUSINESS.
Ojai FOODS IS NOT ABOUT FRUIT.
it NEVER WAS.
it's ABOUT US. IT'S ABOUT OUR FAMILY.
are YOU OFFERING ME A JOB? BECAUSE I DO ALREADY HAVE ONE.
good, BECAUSE I'M NOT.
besides, WE STILL CAN'T AFFORD YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU...
for EVERYTHING.
Oh, NORA, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, UM,
those NURSES SEND THEIR COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF.
Oh. - OKAY,
everybody, ATTENTION.
I HAVE A BOTTLE OF SPARKLING APPLE CIDER,
and IT'S AN EXCELLENT YEAR.
you KNOW, EVERYBODY IN THIS BUILDING
is--is ON SOME KIND OF DRUG, AND WE CAN'T EVEN DRINK.
that's NOT FAIR.
and THAT'S NOT SPARKLING CIDER.
Oh. - OH.
I'd LIKE TO TRY THE SPARKLING - APPLE CIDER, UNCLE SAUL. - SOME SPARKLING APPLE CIDER
for SISTER SARAH, PLEASE.
since WHEN DID YOU TWO BECOME AMISH?
Rebecca, YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ON YOUR PLATE.
Yeah, I'M JUST SAVING ROOM BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO MY MOM'S LATER.
well, THAT CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN STOPPING JUSTIN, HAS IT?
Yeah, SERIOUSLY. - I JUST DON'T WANT TO HURT MOM'S FEELINGS.
could YOU PASS ME THE CRANBERRY UCE?
Oh, I THINK I MAY HAVE FINISHED THAT.
what? I MEAN, I CAN GIVE YOU SOME OF MY CRAN
uh, NO. THAT'S FINE.
you KNOW, I'VE GOT A TOAST.
to ELIZABETH,
my STRONG, LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER,
who, THIS YEAR,
out OF ALL THE THANKSGIVINGS WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER,
has GIVEN US SO MUCH TO BE THANKFUL FOR.
thank YOU. - TO ELIZABETH.
Oh, AND I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST TO PAIGE AND COOPER,
who COULDN'T BE HERE.
you KNOW, I'VE HAD A LITTLE TASTE OF
why MAMA WAS SO DISAPPOINTED AT THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING ANKSGIVING WITH HER CHILDREN.
so TO MOM--THANK YOU FOR THIS FABULOUS MEAL.
Yeah. - TO NORA.
Cheers. - THANK YOU.
okay, I HAVE--I HAVE ONE MORE TOAST. SORRY. JUST ONE MORE.
every THANKSGIVING, WHEN MOM ASKS KEVIN
if HE WOULD LIKE A PIECE OF PIE,
Kevin ALWAYS SAYS THE SAME THING,
and THEN HE PROCEEDS TO EAT HALF OF THE PIE ALL BY HIMSELF.
so HERE'S TO KEVIN, WHO THIS YEAR,
gave NEW MEANING TO THE PHRASE, "OH," JUST A SLIVER.
just A SLIVER.
that IS THE WORST, MOST TASTELESS TOAST I HAVE EVER HEARD.
Oh, KEVIN.
Hey, MOM.
look AT HIM.
how YOU FEELING? - I'M FINE.
Oh! - OH, OH, OH,
no--No, NO, NO. YOU DON'T WANT ANY SPARKLING APPLE CIDER.
here, GIVE HIM SOME WATER. OF COURSE.
make SURE THAT'S WATER.
here's A TOAST. - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
to KEVIN. - TO KEVIN.
Yes, TO KEVIN. - TO KEVIN.
to KEVIN.
I was wondering if I could make an appointment with Dr. Avadon.
Oh, no, no. Shes told me that she would be able to squeeze me in.
Oh, sorry. Uh, kitty. Kitty Mccallister.
I was wonding also if maybe you could tell me if my test results came in.
she told me that they would be in today.
kern knows.
no, you're right. Of course. I'm sorry.
I'll call back later. Thank you.
it's unbelievable. -- I'm sorry, what'd you say?
Kevin just called me when I was out on my run.
governor kern knows about the heart attack.
you're kidding. -- Somebody's got my medical records.
I mean, three months ago, we were tellingevery news oanizationit was a minor arrhythmia.
well, I don't know.
what are you what are you what are you gonna do, Robert?
sometimes medical situations are difficult to talk about.
Kitty, you're a pundit.
you know what kind of narrative they're gonna write with this.
senator Mccallister misled us with a heart attack.
he's untrust worthy, not to mention the fact that he could drop dead at any moment.
no, no, no, no, don't you worry, darling.
nobody's gonna be dropping dead around here anytime soon.
no, not yet.
but this is exactly the kind of thing that could derail this campaign before it even starts, which is probably okay with you.
Oh, you know what, Robert? Please don't start that.
that --that's just not fair. -- Sorry. I just have a lot on my mind.
so what are you gonna do?
well, I've gotten the governor to agree to meet me this morning.
no shots have been fired, and I'm hopefulI can come to some sort of an agreement.
and she's not the only one with opposition research.
you know, I should've just told the truth, the minute I left the hospital.
I don't know what I was thinking.
you know, I was, uh, I was just calling the doctor.
Oh, I thought you said he was okay.
he's fine. He's fine. He is.
you want to go seeyour daddy? - hey . there you go, baby. -- Hey, big boy.
wish me luck today.
I know it's a little over the top, but I'm thinking of making steak and eggs for bakfast.
how do you want yours? -- Bloody.
wait a minute. I've seen that look before.
what look?
like the guy in the movie in the loincloth with a bone through his nose.
just promise me you'll think before you speak.
don't say anything you're gonna regret.
do you know who works for governor Kern now?
Travis March. Do you know what he used to do?
he used to help run Robert's presidential campaign.
I know exactly what I'm gonna say to the Mercenary little bitch.
he probably went to the hospital and stole Robert's chart himself.
bitch? You're off to a really good start.
you know what? He wears loafers with argyle socks.
what would you call him?
I don't know. European?
I just hope you know what you're doing.
Oh, yeah. We're prepared.
hope to put an end to it this morning.
Oh, and if it does go smoothly, I thought we could go to Lucques for dinner tonight.
Doug and Barryare gonna be there. They got a table on the patio.
last time we hung out with them, you said it was like chewing on chili peppers with a mouthfull of canker sores.
Yeah, you know, I meant that in the best possible way.
wait a minute. The patio?
they're bringing their baby, aren't they?
II don't know. Maybe.
well, she is kind of adorable. She's still got that new baby smell.
Kevin, I am so on to you.
I said I don't wantto be pressured about the whole surrogacy thing.
I'm not pressuring.
I --I'm nudging.
I don't want to talk about the baby thing right now. -- Fine.
no more baby talk. Promise.
won't even coo in your ear. -- Thank you.
and next time you feel like bullying someone, save it for your friend in the argyle socks.
it's gonna get soggy.
uh, yeah. You know, it's granola.
I'm not too worried about it. -- Oh, my!
they found a feral child in Michigan. I didn't even know those were real.
apparently, he was.
I'm sorry.
your scaphoid.
your radius, your ulna, your lunate.
your ulna I'm --I'm... you know what Rebecca? I'm sorry.
that's a little distracting right now.
well, I can't exactly clean quieter.
I --I,well, I don't understand why you have to do that right now.
you're right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you know, I'm not trying to be a jerk here.
but I can't memorize the bones of the wrist, let alone graduate if idon't have time to focus, okay?
so. Is there --Is there anything else you could be doing right now?
like what? I'm just doing things that people do around the house.
I'm sorry if I have a job where I can actually finish my work at work.
to be honest, I wish I was a little more inspired right now.
uh, the --the flowers.
didn't you didn't you want to get the flowers, you know, for our wedding?
I already did that, Justin. Forget it.
maybe your mom can give you more work or some. --I love you.
Hello, everyone.
morning, Robert.
Travis, it's good to see you. Governor, you should watch him.
he'll do anything to win, which is uh, I guess why we're here.
to tell you the truth, Robert, my first reaction was just concern.
it's always unpleasant to find out that a friend has health problems.
well, thank you.
if it makes you feel any better, I'm fine now.
uh, according to my pedometer I ran 4 1/2 miles this morning.
impressive.
on that particular day, however, you didn't run anywhere, did you?
no.
no, I spent most of that one in bed.
I assume you've had all this confirmed.
we have a copy of the doctor's report.
there are hipa a laws against that.
Hey, it just landed on my desk. I don't know how it got there.
I think what concerns me is that you were not exactly truthful about what's in that report.
we didn't exactly lie, either.
that depends on what your definition of a heart attack is.
what's your definition of an affair?
I thought my problems were purely anecdotal, Robert.
we have receipts for airline tickets, hotel rooms and some great pictures on my computer.
mexico I imagine.
looks like you're having a good time.
just isn't with your husband.
now how'd you get those?
landed on my desk.
so what? An affair is not gonna take us down.
and a heart attack has legs? Come on, Travis.
sex fuels the media. You know that.
look, this is an uncomfortable conversation for both of us.
I think it's safe to say that we both bring sufficient weaponry to the table to destroy each other.
so if it's okay with you, I'd like to suggest that we don't launch a first strike.
I mean, because personally, I'd like to avoid mutually assured destruction.
it would create tense but stable peace.
worked during the cold war.
I have no problem with that. -- Good.
then it's settled. -- Settled.
mom?
hello.
I just, um.
I had to be in the city, and, uh, as I was driving, I realized that I hadsome time to spare, so I am so glad you're here. Kitty, go swimming with me.
I've been swimming every day.
Oh, you know, mom. -- It's so fabulous.
I can't. I can't. I have an appointment.
well, at least have some of this fabulous water.
I put cucumbers and lemon. It makes you drink more water every day.
here, drink it down.
um, the appointment that I have is a doctor's appointment.
is everything okay? -- yeah.
uh, no.
I'm sorry that I didn't call.
and I would've gone to Sarah, but obviously, she's still in France, and Kevin is busy.
and I don't want to worry you -- Kitty, what's happening?
I don't know. I don't know.
I was just in the pediatrician's office with Evan, and she said that I looked pale.
you know, which is my complexion, okay?
but whatever. She suggested that I get a blood test.
did they find something?
they think I'm sick.
what do you mean "sick"?
she sent me to an oncologist.
Oh, god, kitty. -- Oh, no, no, don't don't, mom.
don't freak out. They don't know anything yet.
I just have this, um, enlarged lymph node here.
and. they removed some of the cells, I guess, with a needle, and then and then she said that some of the cells were ir-irregular.
what does that mean,"irregular"? --They they don't know.
so they -- they sent them to a lab to do some more tests.
and I'm supposed to go in today to get the results, and all I keep thinking about is Evan and...
Kitty, stop it. Now stop it. Don't go there.
they said they don't know everything. -- You're right. I know
I'm sorry.
but anyway, they told me that they don't, they don't want me to go alone.
wait right here. It'll take me one minute. Don't move.
I'll be ready in one minute.
well, I told you, the numbers are not good.
not good? We're hemorrhaging money.
Holly, the luxury market is down, and our wines aren't cheap.
I tried calling Sarah last night, but it's nine hours later in France.
she's not gonna be any help.
she's over there touring highend vineyards. --yeah.
just so you'll know, I have Ryan looking into other venture streams.
Ryan? -- Yes, Ryan.
and believe it or not, he's showing a real talent for this kind of work.
Hey. Oh, uh, am I interrupting anything? -- no no no
Hi, sweetie.
okay, so we've got 20, 000 gallons of wine that we can't afford to age.
so what are we gonna do with the glut?
that's one of the things I have Ryan looking into.
well, can I help with anything?
aren't you working on the market surveys?
Yeah, they're done. They've been done for days.
that's actually why I'm here. I'm dying to do more around here.
well, Saul, why don't you bring her up to speed with what's going on, and we'll see what she can do?
well, I told you, Holly, I already have Ryan working on that.
I don't think that's a problem.
Ojai could use a little friendly competition.
I don't want to step on anyone's toes, mom.
sweetie, if you want to get more involved, you can't be worrying about stepping on other people's toes.
okay.
saul, fill me in.
would you like some gum?
uh, no, thanks. I'm fine.
I've got some calcium chews. -- No, thank you. Fine.
so does Robert even know where you are right now?
uh, no.
he's in the middle of a crisis.
but I know what you're thinking Iand, mom,
I just --I just want to find out what's going on before I have to talk about it to the rest of the world, okay?
well, he's not exactly the rest of the world, sweet.-- Mom. please don't do this, okay? -- All right.
this is unpleasant enoughas it is. -- Sorry. Okay.
I just don't... hi, Kitty.
um, this is my mom.
Hi, I'm Nora Walker. -- Hi, Joan Avadon.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
please. It wouldn't be like a real doctor if we didn't have to wait.
you know, it's not like you're out there popping zits.
she's a little nervous.
I guess anybody who was sitting in this chair would be absolutely...
would be nervous, right? -- Be very nervous.
well, Kitty, um, I've looked over the pathology report and your blood work, and, um, it looks like you have lymphoma.
okay.
it's cancer of the lymph nodes.
what kind of lymphoma? I run a nonprofit home for cancer patients.
well, this is a diffuse large B-cell tumor, which is a non-hodgkins lymphoma.
okay.
so how do we proceed radiation, chemotherapy?
before we talk about treatment, we need to get more information.
we need to find out if it's spread.
so that's why we need to geta C.T scan and a bone marrow biopsy, both of which I'd like to schedule immediately.
okay. We could just do that right away, right?
Yeah. Cathy can schedule that for you.
listen, Kitty, I know you're overwhelmed.
and it's hard to takeall of this in, but I really need you to hear what I'm about to say.
this is a highly treatable and potentially curable disease.
Kitty? -- Oh, yeah. Yes
um, I need a bone marrow biopsy.
okay.
you know, I've got a half a chicken in the refrigerator.
I could wrap it up. You could take it home with you.
Oh, mom, you keep saying the word "home," and I literally want to kill you.
I want to help you.
I know you have a family waiting for you there. -- Oh, believe me.
that's all I'm thinking about.
you are gonna talk to him about this today?
of course I'm gonna tell him.
it's just it's very hard.
well, I've got an idea.
how about if I take Evan for a few days?
it would give you and robert a chance to talk. -- Oh, I don't know.
I don't know, mom.
it's just that Robert just has so much going on right now.
Kitty, you have cancer.
I'm sure your husband can take te out well -- You don't know Robert.
Yes, I do. Don't be silly.
okay, well, what am I supposed to say, mom?
Hi, honey. I have cancer.
how was your day? I just...
Oh, god. This is so crazy.
it's so weird.
I mean, what's gonna happen when I lose my hair?
I love my hair.
it'll grow back.
what if it grows back curly?
Kitty, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
okay.
if there's one thing I've learned from my life, my marriage, it's that facing the truth is so much easier than all the time and energy it takes to run away from it.
okay.
when do you want me to bring Evan over?
okay, great. Thank you.
your cardiologist is gonna call back in a half an hour.
all right. We need to think about getting all of this out there.
I had a hernia in '98.
not that that would affect my being governor, but people should know.
wow, you really trust her.
well, as a matter of fact, I do, but if they have the information, then eventually everybody's gonna have the information.
I mean, we weren't gonna be sitting on this forever.
well, then we should doa focus group. Test different ways of talking about it.
Hi. -- Hi, honey. How are you?
what's happening over there? -- Just working.
the president of the California teachers association arrived.
you wanted to take a look at these before you met with him.
I'm taking Evan for a few days.
Wow. Does Kitty know? -- Ha ha Very funny.
no, I just thought they needed some time alone.
Oh, well, then you know what? I might swing by.
I'll bring Scotty. Evan is kind of irresistible.
fine. Whatever you want to do. That's just fine.
uh, Kevin, how's Robert?
he's not working late tonight, is he?
uh, no. It's pretty calm here for a change.
Oh, good. Look, don't get him all riled up before he goes home.
he's he's unflappable.
Oh, I hope so.
I really hope so.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.
who is that? -- Mom
tell her I said I hi.
uh, Robert says hi, but I gotta go -- Kevin!
Kevin, make sure he gets home at a reasonable time.
okay, I'll try. Love you. Bye.
all right, I'm gonna go meet this teacher, and then I'll be right back, but I still have that TV thing, right?
Yeah, tomorrow.
uh, energy security. You know, developing alternative fuels, etcetera, etcetera.
Oh, my god.
she didn't wait a day.
let me get the volume. -- Don't bother.
I already know what they're saying.
Oh, um, go ahead.
no, ladies first. -- Oh, thanks.
um, you know, I was just talking to my mom, and she was asking me to look into...
I'm sorry. Rebecca, Dan's on the phone for you.
um, you can just tell him I'll call him back.
I think he just wants to give you the gallon counton our surplus wine.
actually, I think those are for me. Thank you.
tell him I already got 'em.
um, yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
see, my mom asked me to look into the glut, too.
Oh, she did?
Yeah.
so wait. Um, I'm confused.
does that mean that she wants us to work on it together?
um. yeah, yeah.
I mean, well, I mean, I--I think that, you know, they kind of want us to, you know, come up with some ideas, and then I don't know, maybe just choose.
okay. So they want us to play a little one on one.
is that a problem? -- No, no, bring it on.
this is a little weird, isn't it?
no, it's not weird.
actually, I'll have him fax you a copy of the numbers, too.
okay, cool. I'll see you later. -- See you later.
we have pictures.
this is the perfect opportunity to label her as a two faced, republican philanderer.
let it go -- I'm-I'm sorry. I don't understand.
why-why can't we hit back?
because this is exactly the kind of politics that people hate.
her turn, my turn.
I have enough trouble running against an incumbent from my own party.
what do you care? You're not the head of the R. N.C.
you're just trying to win an election.
and what do you suggest, that Kern and I keep knocking each other till we're both lying in the dirt, and let a democrat take the oath of office?
the general electionis not for a year.
people will have forgotten your fight with Kern.
and you know what? Let the party go down in flames.
it's people like you who should rise in its place.
and what am I, a guy that wants to score political points' cause I caught my opponent with her skirt up?
I still have to live with myself.
you know, when my family came to California, this state was the envy of a country that was the envy of the world.
and I want to get us back there but I can't do that like this.
she is calling you a liar while lying herself.
that's an issue. It's called hypocrisy.
we're going to talk about the heart attack.
I am going to tell everybody that I am fine.
it is gonna play itself out, and that's all we have to hide.
now I'm cutting out early.
so should you. -- What?
and by the way, I don't think she knew anything about it.
I think this is all Travis trying to play hardball.
what took you so long? -- Got hung up in a meeting.
what do you got for me?
here.
am I gonna like it?
Yeah, it comes with pictures and hotel receipts.
that's always a good thing. -- Have fun with it.
things at Ojai aren't going well.
I mean, I'm aware of that.
but even though she doesn't mean it, Holly just makes things worse sometimes.
I told you how great Ryan was doing at the job, didn't I?
--Yeah, sure.
anyway, he's doing a fantastic job.
he just sees things in a totally different way.
so I asked him to figure out what we could do with the excessive amount of grapes.
and wouldn't you know it?
impulsively, Holly just gets Rebecca involved in it. Do you believe that?
no, I don't.
and now she has them squared off against each other like a couple of pit bulls. --Oh do we really have totalk about this right now?
can't we talk about something else?
I don't give a rat's assabout Holly or grapes.
the world does not revolve around Ojai foods.
please, let's talk about something else.
God, I'm just really not in the mood to chat.
I'm sorry, Saul. I'm...I've gotta go. Evan's waking up. I've gotta go.
it's lymphoma.
they --they don't know what the prognosis is yet, and but it --it doesn't matter how bad it is.
I--I need you and...
that was the longest ride home.
I finally just had to get out of the office.
Where's Evan? Is he already asleep?
uh, no, no. Actually, I,um, well, he --he's spending the night with my mom.
thank you for that. All right. Give it to me.
how bad is it?
well, what --what do you mean?
Oh, god. Did you.
did you talk to my mother?
no, she's the one personI haven't talked to.
but it's --it's everywhere, and I don't think anyone's being straight with me about what the fallout's gonna be.
Oh, my god. It's --it's the heart attack?
you're talking about the heart attack? Kern actually leaked it?
you're kidding me, right?
you didn't know about this until just now? --No -No, I'm sorry. --Kitty, this is breaking news.
it's --it's everywhere. And I.
you knew what I was going through today.
you knew what I was up against. You didn't even call me.
Robert, there's a very good reason.
well, I'd love to hear it, because for someone who claims to want this marriage to work, you have a funny way of showing it.
hello.
okay, put 'em on hold.
it's my top three donors.
they don't think the campaign's gonna last a week.
so I'm --I'm done fighting. I'm just gonna take care of this.
so how upset was he?
considering everything, he was remarkably stoic.
I just can't believe this is happening right now.
well, at least you have Evan here, right?
well, I was hoping they would have time to talk about.
something other than work.
I notice that governor Kern has a few problems of her own.
what do you mean?
she had an affair.
I saw it online.
really.
wait, how do I know this and you don't?
well, no. I --I heard the rumors.
I just wasn't sure if they were true.
well, maybe Robert will feel better that.
Where's Evan?
did you get him to go to sleep?
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
he's been fussing and crying for a straight hour.
they are so cute together.
he's like the baby whisperer.
well, if he's the baby whisperer, then what am I?
probably the baby annoyer.
he's just trying to be nice to meso he can get what he wants.
no, not at all.
all I'm sayingis, you're great with kids.
well, that's because I live with one.
Nora, why don't yout take a break?
I'll --I'll take over for a bit.
I'm fine. --No, you're exhausted. I get it.
I'm not exhausted.
well, Kevin told me you've been complaining, so I thought...
I've been complaining?
no, no, no. -Oh, Kevin!
I said you're probably exhausted.
will you please tell your son to stop making these playdates for me?
Kevin, I love babies, okay?
that doesn't mean I want one. --I have to take this. --Oh, sure.
Hi, what's going on?
no, just hanging with mom, Scotty and your son.
is that Robert?
Yeah, I can come right now if you want.
all right. I'll --I'll be there as soon as I can.
but, no. All I'm --He hung up. --What?
what's wrong?
I think he's a little upset with me right now.
is it about Kitty?
no, believe me.
this is not a marital issue.
I have to go to Santa Barbara, so --I'll call you later. --Wait. Santa Barbara?
what's going... Kevin.
Kevin, Kevin I can't believe this.
wait. Wait. Who's gonna take me home?
unbelievable.
well, I could take you home. --No, it's okay.
you have Evan. I'll --I'll take a cab.
now I think we could break even by selling itto an even larger producer.
every vintner in the state has excess.
and the brokers are setting rock-bottom prices.
and that's why I say we cut out the middle man and just sell it ourselves.
we have the connections to go direct, and we could save that 8%.
and for all this extra effort, all we do is break even?
come on, Holly.
8% is nothing to scoff at.
Yeah, I know. But it's not exactly gonna save the company.
Rebecca, what do you have for us?
actually, what I'm proposing is --is a little bit different.
I think that we should keep the excess juice.
no, I already explained that's not an option.
well, no. You said aging it isn't an option.
I think we should ferment it and sell it.
so you want to make cheap wine?
inexpensive wine.
it's still our grapes.
cannibalize the entire Ojai name just to sell off a bunch of grapes?
if anything, sweetheart, --Ojai has always stood for quality in the marketplace.--Saul, let her finish.
no, no, I understand your objections, which is why I'd create a second label --an affordable, economy-conscious but decent third shelf offering.
simple label, screw cap.
a screw cap?
I -- I-I-I don't I don't know what to say about that.
if we sold each bottle for $2 or $3, we'd profit 50 cents each.
plus the expense of marketing a brand new label.
which would pay for itself once we start to sell.
if it starts to sell.
that's true. There is some risk.
that's putting it mildly.
I'll tell you what, why don't you find the sales figures for wine at that price and get back to me?
saul, we gotta go.
we're late for Vincenti.
Vincenti and maureen. Yeah, okay.
uh, you understand this is all about business, right?
Yeah, yeah, of course. --All right.
you did a good job, kid. --Oh, thanks.
Bye. --Thank you.
wait. Was that a green light? Yeah, I think it was.
that was a really good presentation.
thank you.
it was a lot better than mine.
no, yours was great.
they get really intense about business, huh?
Yeah, and sometimes I feel like I'm caught right in the middle of it.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
you should see him, all curled up with his giraffe.
Kevin's right. You're a natural.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
Scotty, what's going on with all this baby stuff?
what are you feeling? Why are you so afraid?
Oh, I don't know, my mother, the things I grew up hearing.
I mean, two gay dads.
what if it's a boy?
who's gonna teach him how to bait a hook?
bait a hook?
Yeah, or toss a football, beat up a bully I don't know, defend himself.
you have always been so comfortable with yourself, from the very first time I met you, when your --your hair was all the toucan. --The toucan.
and you had a box of red velvet cupcakes.
you seemed perfectly capable of defending yourself.
I'm not buying this whole"baiting the hook" routine.
fine.
you want to know the truth? --Yes.
it's about your son, so brace yourself.
Oh, god. Now what?
no, it's....
he works too much.
and that's never gonna change.
we weren't here ten minutes before his phone rang and he was out the door again.
well, you have a job.
I know I run a kitchen at a very major restaurant.
I don't know how he thinks we're gonna be ableto do this.
have you told him what you feel?
no.
so far, we've only been ableto talk about the money, which is a lot, by the way.
well, Scotty, you have to talk to him, because, believe me, I know Kevin.
and the momen the sees his child, he will adjust his life to make room.
I know, because when you look down at that little person they just simply own you the rest of your life, and all that matters is that.
Nora, are you all right?
Yes.
Yes.
I just think you will be a wonderful dad.
well, don't worry. I'm keeping an open mind.
why do you just assume that I did it?
you said yourself, with things like this, if one person has it, then it's just a matter of time until the whole thing ex --Kevin, you are making this so much harder than it needs to be.
okay, fine.
I was on the phone with a blogger who was gleefully going on about your heart attack.
I was trying to protect you. I'm sorry.
I thought that was my job.
your job is to stay on message.
this campaign has an identity.
it is supposed to be about something.
I was very clear how I felt about that.
but you didn't tell me not to do it.
you were very high minded and noble, but you didn't say that.
you left a window wide open for me.
I mean, come on.
Travis took it upon himself to play "hardball"?
you were practically asking me to do it.
all right, even if that were true, and my impulse control was that far off, I look to you to be my compass.
I need you to pull me back.
I need to be able to trust that.
okay, you guys need to stop.
no, we're just we're justi n the middle of something.--No, no, no. I'm sorry.
but, Kevin, you --you have to leave.
no, he doesn't. --Yes, he does.
no, Kevin. Stay. --No, Kevin. Go.
well, this is now turning into my worst nightmare.
sister trumps boss.
you have to go.
go.
you sure? --Fine.
sorry.
what the hell are you doing?
I need ten minutes with him.
I am in the middle of a crisis.
I have cancer.
I have lymphoma.
it's the bad kind diffuse large b-cell.
what doctor have you --I have been to the oncologist twice.
and I have a bone marrow biopsy-scheduled for tomorrow.
okay, come and sit down. --No, no, I --I don't.
I don't want to sit down.
we just need to talk about this.
I don't want to talk.
I don't want to talk. I can't.
Rebecca, where are the financials?
I put them in your desk.
well, they're not there.
I'm sure I put them there. Did you move them?
how could I move them if you didn't put them back in the first place?
okay, well, do you have another copy?
no, no, Rebecca.
we don't have another copy.
that document is our account numbers, it lists all our assets, everything that we've had to scramble around thanks to Tommy's mess.
Oh, they're right here.
Oh, thank god.
that's so weird. I'm sure I put them in there.
I --I'm sorry.
I just --I have so much stress.
things have gotten so rough around here.
I --I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
no, no, it's fine.
I don't want any special treatment.
I hope that's not why you chose my pitch.
what?
cause I'm your daughter?
no, Rebecca.
I wouldn't do that.
I chose your idea because your idea was the best idea.
you earned it.
thank you.
I gotta go.
where are you going?
back to work.
uh, I'm sorry I'm late.
but the traffic was --did you bring what I asked for?
uh, yeah.
I made the copies like you said.
Oh, and I don't know if this matters or not, but I know they're gonna start making cheap wine and buying bulk juice from other vineyards.
Yeah, it matters.
how long did you know William Walker?
a long time.
What'd you say you needed those for again?
you have your reasons.
I have mine.
I was still reading that.
okay.
I'm still drinking that.
please. This has to stop, okay?
you're still mad.
I get it.
no, I'm thirsty and I haven't finished reading the newspaper.
I --I shouldn't have left you at mom's.
I'm sorry. Look, why don't I just --I'll --I'll pay the cab fare.
call it retribution.
it's not about the cab, Kevin.
I'm not gonna force babies on you ever again okay?
I'm not gonna force anything on anybody.
you should've heard Robert last night.
I'll be lucky if I still have a job when I go in today.
you're always going to have a job, Kevin.
you live for it.
and you say you want a baby, and I'm sure you do, but who's gonna be at home to look after it?
I mean.
I have a life, too, and it may not beas important as yours, it may not be in the newspaper every day, but I like what I do, and I'm not sure I'm ready to give that up yet.
I'm --I'm not asking you to.
Yes, you are.
by the way you live your life, you are.
I mean, look at your hours.
the campaign has barely even started, and what happens when you'reon the road campaigning?
we can get a nanny.
that still doesn't change the fact that you're never gonna be around.
I'm not gonna bean absent father.
I grew up with one.
that's not what I want for my child.
okay.
then promise me if things get crazy, you'll quit your job.
promise me that.
I can't do that.
but what I can do is try to prove to you.
as much as possible that.
I will try my best to do what's right what whatever that is for us and for our kid.
every family has these doubts, but you just have to make a leap of faith.
I just want to make sure we leap together.
we will.
I promise.
the cab cost $32. 50.
but I know how you can pay me back.
so. Does this mean you're in love with me again?
I never stopped loving you, Kevin.
can I get you anything? --No, no.
I am not supposed to eat or drink anything for 12 hours before my bone marrow biopsy.
okay.
I'll be right in here.
okay.
Robert, I --I think I'm ready to talk.
Oh, honey.
no, I know.
no, I don't think you do.
and even if you do, I need to say it.
we are going to fight this, and we are going to go wherever we have to go, see whoever we have to see, and we are gonna win.
cause I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
I just can't believe that you've been carrying all this around inside of you.
why didn't you tell me?
I know. I know.
I thinkI was just.
scared.
but why?
because I was afraid that you wouldn't be there for me.
of course I'm here for you.
maybe I was afraid of that, too.
I --I don't understand.
what if you're only here because I have cancer?
I am here because I love you. --Oh, god.
I want to believe that.
I so want to believe that. I do.
I do.
Hey, how are you?
I'm good.
just, uh, taking a break, finally.
well, I am not.
Ooh, you're not?
what? I finally have more to do around here.
I asked my mom for more work.
and guess what.
I got it.
well, that's --that's great.
what do I get?
you get to wait.
to wait? --Yes.
but I can't wait.
sorry. It's freaky friday.
I love freaky fridays.
okay, fine. But I have to get this done.
I can't just fall asleep after.
I would never ask you to do that.
I'm probably gonna fall asleep after.
I'll tell you that right now.
I'm only here because the governor made me come.
so say it.
you have to.
I went behind her back.
she had nothing to dowith the leak.
And?
I'm sorry.
all right.
now it's your turn.
well, yeah, well, yeah, well, I'm --yeah, I'm sorry.
no, no. Not good enough.
say it louder.
it was, uh.
Yeah, it was --it was my idea to leak your boss' affair, and I'm sorry.
you know, you do realize, when this is all over, we could bevery good friends?
we're cut from the same cloth.
and what is that?
Oh, cynical, meretricious, mercenary god. You're killing me.
do I have something to worry about?
Nope. Just paying my respects.
it, uh, still looks good around here.
goodbye.
goodbye.
what's going on?
dDo you think I'm like him?
I don't know.
maybe.
I mean, I don't know.
you and I have different jobs.
you were trying to protect me, and for e record, if somebody was coming afteryou, I'd rip their head off.
I'd have done the same thing.
great. Uh, you havea television interview, so we should probably head over there.
I'm just gonna go alone.
you --You want me to stay here?
Yeah. I got it.
we're --We are good, right?
Yeah.
we're good.
as you now know, I did have a heart attack a few months ago.
ironically, it was the same day that my son was born.
and, uh, how my wife Kitty managed that day, I'll never know.
Dr. Avadon should beright in.
okay.
Kitty was completely there for me and Evan.
here's a gown for you to put on.
and, uh, let me tell you something, I was scared.
you know, to face your own mortality is frightening.
how you doing?
I'm good as long as I don't look over there.
well, you know what?
why don't you look right here?
Oh, my god.
is that a banana nut? --It is.
and the minute this is all over with, it's all yours.
okay.
let's get you guys out of here.
okay. .
so if I misled the people of California, I also mislead myself.
I'm not proud of it.
but I think that it takes time before you can talk about something like this.
you're gonna feel a little pressure.
you need to find the courage.
the most amazing thing that what's happening, as --as horrible as it is --Is bringing you closer to the people that you love.
it's reminding you of what's most true in your life.
and that is a good thing.
all done.
no matter how it happens.
Nora, what are you doing here?
I dropped Evan off early this morning, and I thought I'd come find you.
I know you walk here every day.
so if you came here to apologize, Nora, you didn't have to come this far.
you could've just called me on the phone.
I wanted to do it in person.
thank you.
apology accepted.
my god, it's beautiful here.
maybe I should walk with you every day, and it would make me strong and calm.
that would be good.
I could use the company.
I'm so tired of trying to make sure everybody doesthe right thing.
I don't know what the right thing is myself.
by everybody, what are you talking about, the children?
Yes. Why do I have to have the answers all the time?
I don't have the answers.
I can't be calm.
I can't be strong.
Nora, you don't have to be calm.
you don't have to be strong.
come on.
Kitty's sick. --What?
what do you mean,"sick"? What kind of sick?
Oh, she doesn't want me to tell you this.
I shouldn't be saying anything. --Nora, tell me.
I'm your brother. It's me.
it's cancer.
she's got cancer. --Oh, god.
it should be me, Saul.
it should be me.
I'm old.
she's so young and she has a little baby.
is she getting treatment?
Yes. --Good.
I don't want her to have to do this.
I don't want her to have to do this.
I don't want her to have to do this.
Oh, it's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
Yep. It means bad poetry.
I know what it means.
you just turned my "dog" into "doggerel."
and it's what, 13 points?
Nope, 26. Double word score.
I am forfeiting this game.
Oh, come on, Robert. You can't forfeit.
sure I can. I've got five I's and an "o."
besides, you look too beautiful.
focus. You have to focus.
I didn't come all the way up here - just to play board games. - You're not trying.
now come on. You said you had an "o."
do you... do you have an... an"r"?
you could spell "rumor." Mnh-mnh.
okay, let me see your letters.
Oh, look at that. You have a "t." - So?
so you can spell "tumor."
I don't want you staring at the word "tumor."
Robert... Do you think that I have forgotten that I have cancer?
Oh, I had Kevin reschedule tomorrow's press conference in case the chemo takes longer than they say.
Oh, no, no, no. You don't... You don't have to do that, - Because, uh, I'm gonna be fine. - No, it's your first time. I should be there.
no, sorry. I've already decided - that you are not gonna be my chemo buddy. - W-w-well, who is?
I don't know. I have a whole gaggle of family members just waiting in line.
but you, my friend, you are gonna be concentrating on the campaign.
what has happened to you?
I mean, you didn't even want me in this race, - And now I want to be there for you... - You're gonna be there for me.
you're running for governor. You're not going to the moon.
and besides, the last thing I need is you quitting on my account.
okay.
can I at least quit this game?
Yes. You can.
excuse me, Dr. Condon?
yes?
I'm, uh, Justin. Justin Walker.
I'm sorry. Office hours don't start until 1: 00.
you know what? This will only take a second.
okay. - I've been reading up on the cancer research you've been doing,
and I know it's a bit late, but I was wondering if I could possibly join your team?
my assistant positions were filled a month ago. - I know. And I know this would be making an exception.
well, even if I could, my grant funding only allows a certain number of students.
okay, you know what? I'd, uh, I'd volunteer.
I'd, uh, I'd work for free. - Uh, what year are you?
first. - You know, in my experience, it's better not to rush into specializing.
you might want to take a year or two, - Make sure oncology's what you really want to do. - No, it is. Look, I'll, uh, I'll do anything.
I'll, uh, empty your trash. I'll sweep the floors.
I can, uh, offer you a pen that works. Here you go.
what was your name again? - Justin walker.
I'll think about it, Justin.
thank you. Thank you. Um, I won't disappoint you.
sorry I'm late.
where are we? - We?
Yeah. - You mean me.
okay. That's all right. We'll catch up.
I was trying to get an internship with Dr. Condon.
but you barely got this under control. - Look, I can handle this.
look, I told you. I'm not gonna get dragged down - But your unfocused, naive approach to medical school. - Look, I told you I can handle this.
all right, Carter?
unbelievable.
I know this is probably not what you're in the mood for, but, uh, Rebecca and I are gonna look at wedding venues today.
I would so love to, but I can't today.
it's, um, Kitty's first chemo treatment, and I have to be there.
she hates hospitals, and she hates needles, and it's... it's gonna be a very rough day. She needs me.
of course. - Besides that,
I really don't want to intrude on your mother-daughter time.
please, we're going to be in-laws soon enough.
we would love to have you with us.
thank you, Holly. I really appreciate that.
okay, bye. - Holly, you wanted to see me.
uh, yeah.
I want you to follow up a line on a juice broker.
Mm. - I think I have finally located a supply of cheap wine that we can use to make our blend.
I would do this myself, but I have promised Rebecca that we would look at wedding venues today.
okay, but don't you think we should wait until Sarah gets back to work?
I mean, she needs to weigh in on the possibility of a low-budget or a second line plan.
and who knows? She might have found something in France. - Well, we need the revenue now.
we need to put this deal into motion with the broker today. - Okay, well, how do you know people are gonna buy this $2. 99 swill, Holly?
in this economy, people will buy it if we market it correctly.
and if you give them a lottery ticket - to distract them from the taste. - You know what, Saul? Forget that I even asked.
if that's the way you want to leave it, that's fine with me.
no, what I want is to generate new revenue now.
we have no idea how long it's gonna be before people are willing to buy high-end products again.
and quite frankly, we can't afford to wait.
Hey.
Hi.
what, are we having company?
no. No. I just want to be prepared.
we don't know how you'll feel after this first treatment.
so I made all your favorites. I made tapioca pudding.
I made fresh banana bread, lots of ...
no, no, don't, don't. Don't...don't drink that.
you don't want any of that. No, no, no.
look, I made you a protein drink.
because they say you shouldn't go there on an empty stomach. - Empty stomach. Yeah, right.
Yes, so I made you a great protein drink.
and it has almond milk and protein powder and...
Mm. It's thick.
Oh. A little thick.
well, let me just thin it out for you.
and then I'll put it in a travel mug,
because we can take it with us.
and I am all ready to go.
Oh, mom. Oh, god, mom. I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot to tell you that... that Sarah is actually going to come here and pick me up.
and... and she's gonna be my chemo buddy for today.
Oh, great. Good.
Yeah. I mean, I, you know, I've hardly seen her since she got back from France.
and I thought that it would be a nice opportunity for us to catch up.
so, you know, it doesn't all have to fall on you, okay?
I mean, look at... look at all you've done so far.
and it's only 10: 00 in the morning.
I mean, I think you should take the day.
take the day and just enjoy yourself, - Because guess what. - What?
I am gonna be fine. - Yes, yes.
Yep.
I know that. I know that.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
the truth is, Kitty and I spent a great deal of time weighing this decision, and the choice was clear...
we could suspend our campaign and let the cancer win, or we could continue to live our own lives and stand up for what we believe in.
and so that's why I'm staying in the race.
because Kitty and I believe
that's what's best for our family as well as the state of California.
okay, I'll take a few questions now. Uh, one at a time.
um, Steve. - Senator, I think I speak for everyone - in wishing Kitty well. - Thank you.
but to focus on your decision to keep campaigning...
do you risk losing donors who may fear you might drop out down the road?
well, uh, I think that my donors appreciate that I'm steadfast in my decisions.
so, no, I...I don't think that's gonna be an issue.
uh, yes, Lynda. - If Mrs. Mccallister does support your decision to stay in the race, why isn't she here today?
she's at home recuperating. - Of course, but, Senator, are you concerned that continuing your gubernatorial run in the face of your wife's conditions will appear callous?
well, I think most Californians would appreciate that this is a private, family matter, and I think that they'll judge it as such.
next question.
now, Kitty, you may feel a little cold - as it reaches your vein. - Okay.
here, let's warm you up. Come on.
get you nice and warm.
Sarah... Can you, uh, can you talk please?
what do you want me to talk about? - I don't know. I don't know. Anything.
you can talk about your trip. - Okay.
there it is.
it's okay.
you're okay.
so... We were running late, sat on the tarmac for, like, two hours.
I don't know how the airlines get away with that.
we circled Paris for at least an hour...
Sarah, tell me a good story.
I don't want to have to fire my chemo buddy.
I met a guy.
you did? Mm-hmm.
Really? - Really.
well, you didn't... You didn't tell me that. -Well, I'm telling you now.
Oh, my god. Wow. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
okay. Okay, I want you to tell me every detail, and don't skip on anything.
okay.
I was running late.
I'd been driving all morning.
I was lost looking for this little vineyard - outside a place called Bergerac... - Oh.
driving through these beautiful fields peppered with sunflowers.
and there was this little farmland, I guess...
beautiful, big, old barn.
Bonjour. Uh, puis-je vous aider?
Bonjour.
c'est dit ici, uh, il pour tourner ? droite.
sur, uh, rue de chollet.
Oh, no. Uh, no. Tourner ? gauche.
il pour tourner ? gauche on rue de...de, uh, chollet.
Avez-vous entendu parler
de cheau de, uh, chollet?
vin? Vin? You know...
non. You're enjoying this, aren't you?
okay, look, I-I have an appointment.
uh, j'aI rendez-vous... Business.
it's a winery. Um... De chollet.
nothing?
cheau chollet.
s? Oui, oui, oui. Cheau chollet.
of course. It's not so far.
you speak English?
Oui, bien sur! Of course.
Oh. Well, I'm very glad to have amused you.
it was cute. - Could you please give me some directions?
I'm...I'm running late for this appointment. - I take you. I take you.
you'll take me?
are... are you sure?
let's eat, and then we go.
Oh, uh, no. No. I'm sorry I didn't explain myself.
I'm running late. I have to... - You don't want me to take you?
uh... No, no.
uh... I just... I have to go now.
what do you think?
hmm. Oh.
how are you feeling? Everything okay?
Yeah. - Any shortness of breath?
no, no. I-I feel great. I-I feel like I could run a mile.
good. How about chills, any of those?
no, no, not at...not at all. - Okay.
um, this is Sarah, my sister. She just met a guy in France.
Congratulations.
Merci beaucoup.
um, she does seem to be shivering a little bit.
no. - Is that normal?
totally. We'll just, uh, slow down the drip and give you an extra dose of hydrocortisone, - see if that calms things down. - Okay.
I wanted to go over, with both of you, the post-care information. - Okay, okay, can you just please, um, maybe give us one second?
sure.
um... Did you...did you stay?
Kitty. - No, no, no, just tell me. Tell me.
of course I stayed.
you know, Jean Harlow once lived here.
Really?
Yeah. - Wow.
Hi. - Oh, hi.
Nora. - I'm so glad I found you. Did I miss anything?
Hi, I'm Nora. I'm... I'm the groom's mother. - Oh, welcome.
what... what are you doing here? - Hi, honey.
I asked her. - Yes.
I thought Kitty was getting a treatment. - Well, yes, she did.
we were halfway out the door, and Sarah showed up.
they haven't had any time to be together since Sarah got back.
and then I got to come help you here. - Oh, that's so sweet.
Oh, this is so exciting. I can use all the help I can get. - Well, I'm... I'm... I'm thrilled, and look at this!
Wow. Look at... this is an impressive place.
Jean Harlow once lived here. - Did she live here?
Yeah.
Oh, that must be Sarah. - Oh, no, noï¼Œit's mine. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
no. This will just be one minute. Yeah, what is it?
Yeah, I-I just need the price of the juice.
fine, fine. Put me through to the broker.
uh, now most of our couples do a cocktail hour right out here.
we fill the pool with floating candles.
it's beautiful. I mean, what do you think, Nora?
well, I-I think... I think you have to, you know, feel it.
feel what?
well, feel that it's right.
feel that it's like you and Justin.
well, I mean, Justin likes water.
uh, I'm so sorry. Oh.
so where were we? - Uh, why don't we go upstairs?
we have a fantastic area for the bridal suite.
Oh. - Are they shooting a movie?
hmm? - Are you shooting a movie here?
uh, yes. Well, you know, we rent the space out for a variety of events. I thought they'd be done by now.
must be a period piece. - I-I think it is.
what period?
um... Olden times.
Yes. I can't keep up.
but why don't we go look at the bridal suite? Shall we? - I'm sorry.
um, are they shooting porn? - Can someone fix my sword?
uh... I need some more oil.
Really?
here, now? - Dear!
well, now... now we don't rent out the space for filming on the weekends.
and I would be happy to throw in free valet. - Free valet.
Oh, no. I don't think so, no. Go, go.
we can get to the street this way, can't we? - Yes. - No.
go right down these stairs. - This wasn't supposed to happen.
we need to discuss the Kitty issue.
internal polls are showing a drop. - First of all, can we please - not refer to my wife's illness as "the Kitty issue" ? - Okay, sorry.
um, but if we don't get Kitty out there and show the public she's behind you, - this is just gonna get worse. - No, it'll be worse if we do. They'll think we're using her.
it's a risk, I agree, but we can't do nothing.
look, Kevin... and jot this down if you have to, because I'm... I'm not gonna say it again...
Kitty's well-being has nothing to do with - the state of California or my integrity or my job performance. - Why can't we say that?
we did say that. We... we said that explicitly. - Yeah, and they didn't hear you. You know why?
it came from the wrong mouth.
a statement at the least.
no, I'm not gonna use her. - I will help her draft it myself.
no, do not...Kevin, back o...
there is too much in play for you to see this clearly.
leave Kitty alone. She and I have made a decision.
and that should be good enough for everybody! Including you.
spend the most important day of your life in the opulent astin ballroom.
details include fine linens with buttercup or eggshell, silver, gold or black chiavarI chairs...
what's chiavari?
well, it's that. That's a chiavarI chair.
Oh. Okay, wait. W-what else is in this...
this "love in the afternoon" package?
a love in the after...
it includes a chocolate fountain.
um... Um...
Yeah, the idea of the Walkers in the same room with five tiers of hot, molten chocolate is pretty terrifying.
all of these packages...
they're like... they're like a slightly different version of the same generic wedding.
Oh, well, maybe your mom has some ideas - How to personalize it. - Yeah, if she would ever get off the phone.
sweetie, you know what?
if you don't like this venue, then we should just go.
there are plenty of others to look at.
Yeah, maybe we should.
so what do you think? Does this place have potential?
uh, no. We're moving on. - We just got here.
well, maybe it seems that way because you've been on the phone - the entire time - But... Rebecca, I was only on the phone for five minutes.
look, why don't we not make any decision - until we tour the grounds? - Why, so we can just sign a check and get the search over with?
I mean, I know that this is an inconvenience for you, clearly, but... You know, I-I don't think that...
that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying how can you make - an informed decision without checking out the entire venue. - Because I've seen enough to know that it's not right.
I mean, ask Nora. You either feel it or you don't.
okay, I-I think there is something to that.
but... but still, you... - But what, mom? You've never done this before.
Nora has, multiple times.
I mean, Kevin and Scotty's wedding was perfect, - And it was... it was so them. I want that for justin and me. - Oh, so what you're saying
is that you want to have your wedding at Nora's?
well, she's sitting right here. So why don't you just ask her? - You know, that...
Oh, my god, no. If you would just listen for once,
you would know that's not what I'm saying at all.
I'll tell them I'll call them right back. - You know what? Take it. Take it.
that's what you'd rather be doing anyways. - Rebecca, please.
take the call. - I don't have to take it.
Nora, I'm sorry we wasted your time. To think that we could - actually do this together? It's unbelievable. - Rebecca, don't be this...oh!
careful. You'll sever the radial artery.
