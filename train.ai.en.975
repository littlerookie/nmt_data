then we'll kick them in the ass!
we'd better separate.
meet back here in 10 minutes.
all right.
if I find her first you must give me a reward.
okay.
what are you doing here?
what's going on? -There are intruders, sir.
bring them here. -Yes. sir.
wait! Wait!
Arigato. Sayonara.
now what should we do now?
we can't leave town now. Let's find a place to hide.
without your help we couldn't have done it.
please don't mention it.
the pleasure is all mine, ma'am.
you sound so polite.
now you've got manners.
and you are...
my name is Kom.
it's very nice to meet a beauty with such brains.
please let me know your name.
in fact, he is just our apprentice spy.
just started.
not much experienced.
we need to find medicine for Zeena.
and I have to go back to my unit.
but I need to go to my hotel first.
I will accompany you.
Hey, what about Zeena?
Zeena...
let Kom take care of her.
we can trust him.
please take good care of her.
she has a fever.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
we failed to catch those thieves.
this is not tolerable for the Emperor's army.
if anybody can catch them he'll be rewarded.
we're so glad you rescued Zeena.
thank you.
we owe the Thai Thieves.
actually, we need more co-operation from others.
when will I get my orders to leave here?
not now.
you'll wait for the Japs' gold to come through this area.
gold?
why this area?
we are trying to find out.
but more in-depth information is needed.
be careful.
your cover has been blown.
I'll be in touch.
now we have a ready-made scapegoat.
just send in your men disguised as the Thai Thieves.
end of story.
what if they know about this?
I'll be caught between a rock and a hard place.
don't worry.
we'll have taken the gold far away by then.
no one can stop us.
pack your stuff. We have to leave.
Toh...
the wanted spies left the town.
I heard they are heading this way.
this way?
are you the Allies' spies?
who are you?
I'm Toh Teen Nak head of the Thai Thieves in this area.
then you know these guys?
which guys?
Oh, may I have a word with you?
what's the matter?
I'm not sure if these guys are on my side.
do you mean the round one?
with the long chain?
the one that plays music?
that's mine!
Hey! Catch them!
don't come any closer.
I'll kill her.
what's going on?
No!
so who are you really?
wait.
who the hell are you?
Where're you from? Who are your parents?
how is your picture in this newspaper?
how did you get involved?
I told you
I've been to the south looking for work.
boss. -What?
they left only some clothes.
damm it! Didn't you watch them?
I watched them, sir.
then how could they escape?
go! Go!
we got a message that the Japs are carrying gold on the train.
if so, we need the help of the Thai Thieves.
we need to stop the Japs.
definitely.
then you will see how much we can disrupt the Japanese troops.
just wait and see how we grind them to pieces!
get rid of him.
wait!
don't you want to know what my double plan is?
what?
not the double plan!
you show off too much.
anyway, what is your double plan?
where will you take me?
I'm exhausted!
being with me is that annoying?
you haven't stopped whingding at all!
Yes.
I can go anywhere with anyone that is not a liar!
help! Somebody help!
if you go on shouting
I'll kiss you and then kill you!
understand?
didn't your right hand man come with you?
that bastard Chua!
I haven't seen him for days.
are you sure they're gonna come this way?
if you don't trust me, who else are you gonna trust?
I won't stab you in the back the way your people did to you.
if he thinks he's gonna stab me in the back he better think again!
quick! Make it quick!
come on! Quick!
Hey! Stop it!
what the hell's the matter?
Lam!
Oh, it's Toh. You bastard.
you keep opposing the Japs!
I'm not Japanese!
why the hell do you oppose me?
you don't have to tell me.
you don't look Japanese.
and you're not one of my Thai Thieves either!
I'll ask you frankly.
why do you pretend you are one of us?
I wear the same things as the villagers around here.
I'm not faking.
you have two choices.
either you leave the gold here or you leave your life here.
pick one!
all right.
Lam...
you should tell your men to drop their guns.
Kom, you asshole.
sorry...
I have to do it for my country.
what?
drop your guns.
are you Toh?
I've known about you for so long but today is the first time I got to see your ugly face.
I'd like to say you are the best.
and you are...
I'm General Sun a member of the Free Thai Movement.
I'm in charge of carrying and using the gold you stole from the Japanese to eliminate the Japanese from our kingdom.
these are Kom Wang Hin and Yai Tarua ...my spies.
so we have the same mission.
since we both oppose Japan -You don't have to worry. -It's fine.
so let's not waste the time. Please do me a favour.
please ask your men to put the gold in my car
I have to carry the gold back to Bangkok by tonight.
no need to say 'please' at all.
don't mention it.
I'll take care of it, sir.
let's get the gold into the General's car.
you must be Agent Patty.
and you, Agent Zeena.
it's my pleasure to meet you.
don't worry.
Dr. Pratuang wouldn't have got a degree without copying me in the exam.
it's my pleasure, Zeena.
if it weren't wartime.
I would ask you to go the temple fair.
excuse me.
we'd better hurry or we won't get back to Bangkok in time.
mind your own business!
excuse me...
I hope we will see each other again.
we really need to hurry.
why didn't you tell me you're with the Free Thai Movement?
why did you make it more complicated?
I didn't tell you the truth because I wanted to be sure of who is on my side.
Zeena...
are you happy I'm not a bad guy?
I don't feel anything.
why not?
why do I have to be happy?
you once told me you are uneasy with a bad guy.
so from now on you don't have to be uneasy with a good guy like me.
what is your next destination then?
don't know.
need to wait for the order from the Unit.
but perhaps I may go to Europe.
Europe?
it's very dangerous there now.
Why?
you care about me?
no, I'm just worried about the girls there.
all right...
see you next time the country needs us.
okay.
so you only lied to me because you were following orders?
Yes.
fine.
hope next time we meet you won't have to lie any more.
I didn't imagine it would be that easy.
if I'd gone into acting
I'd be a superstar by now.
Yes.
if you were the hero
I would be the heroine, sir.
just kidding, sir.
you're creepy!
I won't let it happen again, sir.
captain...
wake up!
now is no time to take a nap!
where are we?
what's the hell's up with you, Yai?
you changed cars four or five times!
why the hell are you stopping on the bridge?
I hope the car doesn't break down because only you can drive this bloody car!
I suggest we change the way to carry the gold.
around here the Japs are everywhere.
there's no other way! Will we go down a mousehole?
no, we'll go that way!
this way!
just two boxes left.
make it quick!
hey Baldy, what're you looking at?
what are you doing? Give them a hand!
no.
captain, go help them!
but I have only one uniform, sir.
would you rather be handsome or disgustingly rich?
the river is very deep.
won't the gold rust?
all ten boxes are here, sir.
good.
what can I do on this stupid raft?
still, once I get off all my dreams will be waiting.
wake up! Are those your guys?
why do they have to come this way?
I'm not sure, sir.
how come you're not sure?
it's your plan.
are you a ghost or what?
we don't play trick or treat!
I'll kick you in the bollocks!
behind us.
are you saving the bullets for your father?
what the hell?
wait! Wait!
there's only me left. Let's negotiate.
we're seizing their raft.
the gold is ours now.
we are rich!
general...
where is the gold?
these are stones!
where is the Japanese gold?
search the place!
search everywhere!
find the gold!
otherwise...
you'll be eating these stones for dinner!
can't you stop whingding!
how can l? You're wasting my time!
stones! My dream is over!
leave it to me!
give me a hand!
move your ass.
do you have a few seconds?
it's all right.
let's speak Thai.
you seem to have a business mind.
I was a gold dealer before the war.
I'll invite you to have a drink with me some time.
my pleasure.
now...
we have one Japanese on our side.
but I can't do everything by myself.
I'm really up against it so if you both can help me that'd be great.
I've already had the gold transportation route changed.
now it's up to you.
the horror of the Second World War brought long miserable days to many.
but there were people who took chances and made themselves rich out of war.
No! I'm ticklish!
that suitcase is mine, isn't it?
do you want to count it?
no. I trust you and I'm in a hurry.
it's a pleasure working with you.
please keep in touch.
so we can work together again.
no problem, bro.
Bye.
we will be reaching our destination in fifteen minutes.
the enemy's airplane.
Mayday! Mayday! We are under attack.
you must jump now.
go!
the Japanese are coming. Hurry up.
let's go.
you just go now.
save yourself.
when did he call?
an hour ago. Captain.
before the General and her ladyship got here.
he warned us to keep an eye on her diamond necklace.
he will snatch it during the show. sir.
have you informed the General yet?
I didn't dare, sir.
good.
don't let anyone know about this.
I'll handle it myself.
hello.
this way, Darling.
excuse me.
good evening, sir.
Kom Wang Hin?
Kom Wang Hin!
he loves rading.
killing!
Raping!
bugger!
what's the matter, Captain?
I don't want to ruin your night over that two-bit thief.
I'm afraid you and your wife will be distracted from the show.
but his treats are so disrespectful to you!
I've heard of him.
he's one of the great thieves, isn't he?
Oh, no.
that's just a rumour.
he's nobody.
he's just a two-bit thief.
captain...
you have to take this seriously.
just tell me what you want.
my men are ready to help.
Yes, sir.
no need to worry, darling.
you look so worried.
I do, of course.
when he sets his sihgts on something he always gets it.
it's true he's never failed.
but Captain Harn is here.
the police department's best man.
even with angel wings the thief couldn't get in here.
that's right, ma'am.
and if he does get in he won't survive.
see？
he has everything under control.
don't worry, darling.
darling!
you dirty old man!
that's why I couldn't feel any necklace.
or any neck wrinkles, either!
who shot the gun?
what are you waiting for?
follow me.
bastard! How dare he! -Darling.
is your necklace all right? -It's still here.
I'll take care of it.
excuse me, sir.
Yes, Captain?
how is it going?
nothing so far, sir.
see, darling?
even now they have nothing at all!
excuse me, your Ladyship.
I wonder if you remember what the thief looked like.
more handsome than you, of course!
darling...
in a few days
I have to go to a banquet.
what will I wear then?
this one also looks great.
you should wear it. Nobody Will know.
maybe they won't but I know it's fake.
it gives me a rash around my neck!
I'll buy you a new one later.
please wear this one for now.
I'm still paying the instalments on the first one!
what are you laughing about?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'd like to make a promise.
he will be a jailbird for ages.
Jailbird?
right now he's free as a bird!
I don't trust you any more.
how could such a two-bit thief evade the whole police force?
how could he steal it from under my nose?
I've got an excellent plan for you.
again？
what damn plan？
it takes a thief to catch a thief, sir.
it stinks in here!
excuse me.
are you that bastard named Yai Tarua the great thief of the Chao Phraya River?
who the hell are you?
why are you bothering me this early in the morning?
don't you know who you are speaking to?
it's all right, Captain.
I didn't much want to come here.
but l bring best regards from someone in hell!
Kom Wang Hin!
I don't give a damn how big you are don't mention that bastard's name again!
Yai Tarua.
you are too big for your boots!
but I like you. I'm here for one reason.
I'll give you your freedom if you can find Kom and bring him to me.
interested?
are you Kom Wang Hin?
just say what you want.
did your boss send you to pick me up?
Yes.
the boss is waiting for you.
I'm the one he's waiting for.
Kom Wang Hin.
Kom...
don't you know General Sun is hunting for you?
are you stupid or crazy?
how dare you provoke him and then try to sell the necklace to me?
I hope you're not saying that just to get a better price.
you think I'm some kind of pawnbroker?
whatever I want
I can pay whatever it costs.
in wartime like this money is rare.
it's of great quality, sir.
fifty thousand.
I'll give you half that.
forty thousand.
thirty thousand. Enough.
thirty is fine.
dishonest deals involve dishonest prices.
I understand you have to save your money to hire men to rob a Japanese train.
where did you get that from?
Oh, Lam.
everyone knows that.
don't panic.
what do you want?
how about this?
you let me do it and give me a share.
I won't take much.
and if anything goes wrong you don't have to get involved.
just follow my plan.
what do you think, Chua?
I don't trust him.
he's got a forked tongue.
how does he know about our gold robbery?
he must have read the paper.
you idiot!
I smell a mole.
find him!
who's that?
thief!
toh Teen Nak.
good evening. -Good evening.
be careful!
you'll break it!
slow down.
he's here.
I was told you wanted to see me.
I am Pratuang.
professor Rawee sent me to see you.
I'm very glad to meet a member of Thai Thieves.
so you're a member of the Free Thai Movement.
that is right.
I've got a message for you.
our spies will get here to co-operate with you.
you keep this pocket watch.
they will find you.
is there anyone else?
no.
I know how to deal with the girl.
have you finished yet?
not yet, sir. Please give me more time.
all right.
we'll take her to Thailand.
Yes, sir.
you bitch!
come on.
you're dreaming.
I know where Kom is.
just follow me.
we only accept members.
who the hell are you?
everyone! Don't move!
this is personal!
yai, your manners never improve.
for you...
no bloody manners needed!
this is polite enough!
Thanks, buddy.
who are you calling buddy?
today I'll clean my feet with your blood!
Yai...
do you know why you were in jail while I was earning my money here?
it's because I'm smarter than you!
what do you want?
you want your little man blown off?
where the hell is Kom?
I don't know.
look at all those planes.
Kom, you son of a bitch!
Hey! This is dangerous!
Kom!
quick, quick!
no, no.
you'll probably disappear just like them.
Toh...
the Japs have got two guys.
I guess...
they're the spies you're looking for.
the Japs always get them!
no matter how many spies were sent they were all caught.
now we'll have to rescue them.
and then what? Damm it!
anyway...
just follow my plan.
here you're behind the hill.
then you come here.
you three, remember this.
the three of you move to the top of the hill.
you three are behind the hill.
you got that?
you know 'behind the hill'?
repeat after me. Behind the hill.
behind the hill. -Behind the hill.
correct.
then another three come here.
you are here.
on the left. Here.
but then where am l?
wait, wait.
I'm still here.
not in the middle.
the Japs can get me there.
do I make myself understood?
no.
damm it!
you bastard!
you've got the wrong guy.
I'm not a spy!
why don't you give me anything to eat?
are you just going to let me die?
let me go!
I don't even know that bastard!
stop yapping.
what are you, a damn dog?
tie him up!
why the hell are you putting me in this sack?
don't you think it's damn hot?
tell me who you are!
out with it!
when the dark clouds are blown away hundreds of birds fly high.
free from clouds so dark that they hide the moon from sight.
what the hell are you talking about?
we are saved!
go get them!
let go of me!
the Japs are running away.
go get them.
I'm not that bloody spy!
let me go.
we are on the same side.
don't shoot me!
we are on the same side. Help me!
it's time for a samurai to duel with a Thai swordsman.
no problem.
go ahead and find out if a Japanese or Thai sword is faster and sharper.
be my guest.
now you know.
he's dead.
someone dies everyday.
my brother!
why do you leave me?
he's gone.
seriously, are you a spy?
Yes. We're spies.
we are brothers.
he's the eldest. I'm the youngest.
we've worked together since we were children.
and what will you do now when your brother has gone?
I have another mission.
a very confidential one ...in Bangkok.
by the way, I thank you very much.
what is your name?
my name is 'Big Foot'.
want to know how big it is?
Oh, no.
thank you.
I'll ask my unit to send you the letter of appreciation.
no need.
we've fought for the kingdom and the Thai people.
we've never wanted any reward.
I must start my mission now.
all right.
Oh, no!
they took all my stuff!
what's wrong now?
the Japs took all my money!
why did you let them take it?
can you give me twenty baht?
Damn! Go and get it from the Japs.
they took all my money.
I need it to go on with my mission.
OK, let's pitch in twenty baht for his trip to Bangkok.
are you all deaf or what?
doesn't anyone got any money at all?
okay. Stop crying!
how much?
twenty baht, sir.
Damn!
if my kids begged like this I'd knock their heads off!
here you are.
thank you.
this will cover the trip.
but what about food?
without food, I'll starve to death!
then my mission will be impossible.
I'll tell my unit that you wouldn't co-operate.
don't you dare!
here you are.
now stop whining.
and keep your mouth shut in Bangkok.
thank you.
damm it.
I really appreciate this.
that's all right.
without your help, I wouldn't make it.
we are Thai. We help each other.
next time it'll be my turn to help.
that's all right.
thank you very much.
what about him?
what should we do about him?
should we leave him like this?
or find a place to bury him?
let's give him a burial.
okay. Everybody give him a hand.
three or four bodies daily.
what a heavy corpse!
bury him near the fruit tree in case he's hungry.
you're a real bastard!
you stole my wife's necklace.
but then what?
you got caught anyway.
sir...
should we press charges against him?
no, we won't press charges against him.
I'll cut him with my samurai sword and bury him alive!
but it's against the law, sir.
are you going to stop me?
I have one more thing to tell you.
go ahead.
I know that he's got a much bigger plan up his sleeve.
tell him, bastard!
you bastard!
tell me what the hell's going on!
Yai...
don't think you'll get your hands on my gold!
if I don't get it you won't either.
what gold?
the Japs' gold.
they plan to rob the train.
what?
why don't we know about this, Captain?
untie him.
piece of cake.
my share is 90%.
you two share the rest.
what about me?
it's my plan!
if everything works out
I'll set you free.
don't let money be your master.
as long as you're alive, you can earn more.
relax.
then give me another 10%.
no negotiation.
I have the final word.
tell you what
I'll be in charge.
how are you? -Yai...
Yao!
look! Who's here?
where are you going?
come over here.
finished yet?
if yes, get out.
I haven't seen you for ages.
your shit still smells bad!
we're in public.
don't you respect the law?
do I look like a coward?
what made you think this tiny knife could scare me?
Argh, a gun!
I give up! Don't shoot!
No! No! OK, I am a coward.
you cheated me out of 180 baht in that card game.
No! It's 200 baht!
interest included.
that's all there is.
I saw something like gold.
there's nothing.
nothing? Just check his ass!
kiss it, more like!
come on!
Hey! That's my mother's.
I don't care.
make it quick!
there's nothing left.
give me that!
what do you want my pants for?
because I want them.
what will I wear?
I'll cut it off.
stay out of our business.
God bless you.
let's go.
you asshole!
you bastard!
come back here!
let's fight!
I'll show you how to box!
somebody help! Give me my pants.
I'm shy, of course.
is anyone here?
not even a dog?
how can I leave here?
captain, did you book the hotel for me?
don't forget to find me some girls, too.
I don't like to sleep alone.
but, sir...
I'm afraid if your Ladyship finds out
I'll be blamed, sir.
then don't let her find out, dammit!
why the hell are you always in my way?
what can I do for you, sir?
anything you need, just let me know.
captain, keep your mouth shut!
if my wife finds out, you'll be held responsible.
but, sir...
this is unethical.
that's enough, Captain.
you'd better quit and become a monk.
Kom, when's the car picking us up?
I'm dying for a shit.
very nice to meet you.
you, too.
you recognise me?
Yes.
I hope we can work well together.
but I don't think we should talk here.
we should find a private place.
whatever you say.
I'll be okay. -Fine.
please give me a few minutes.
are you in a hurry?
no, I'm not.
may I use the toilet?
be my guest.
there's someone following me.
come and hide in here.
okay.
no problem. I got hit yesterday.
okay. Just hide in there.
we're from the government.
sorry. We are assigned to search your place.
wait. What's the matter?
only my husband and I stay in this room.
I'm afraid it's a misunderstanding.
please accept my apologies.
something in my stomach must be rotten!
Hey, who is this man?
he's another Free Thai Movement member who will take us to help Zeena.
sorry.
hello.
hello.
you have to help Zeena.
let's go.
where are we going?
general Sun wants to see you.
make it quick.
sir.
any news?
the train carrying gold will get here in 3 days.
Damn! You made me wait here all night with mosquitos biting my bollocks off ...just for that?
if there's any more news
I'll inform you at once.
I have to go. It's late.
can we trust this bastard, Captain?
I wouldn't, sir.
he's a crook!
I, as the leader of this Thai community ...would like us all to drink a toast to General Yamada on his promotion.
on behalf of the Japanese Emperor's soldiers
I appreciate the Thai people's welcome tonight.
but I believe there is still a group of Thais who have been determined to oppose the peace-making process of both countries.
I vow...
not to bow down to them.
they will be arrested and suppressed to the maximum degree.
how is everything going upstairs?
it's very crowded.
what have you got?
here you are.
you almost poked me in the face with that!
light!
Lam! You traitor!
you don't deserve to live!
you help the Japs to kill Thai people.
you'll pay for that.
why the hell did you let it off?
it almost exploded!
light the fire!
who dares mess up my place?
get back to the base.
sir...
the party tonight sounds enjoyable.
girls are screaming with joy.
fortunately Lam isn't good at barbecuing.
the Japs deserve burnt food!
find them!
who are they? Find them!
can't you see what's going on?
it's not only us that want their gold.
anyway...
let them play hard until their strength is gone.
then we'll kick them in the ass!
we'd better separate.
meet back here in 10 minutes.
all right.
if I find her first you must give me a reward.
okay.
what are you doing here?
what's going on? -There are intruders, sir.
bring them here. -Yes. sir.
wait! Wait!
Arigato. Sayonara.
now what should we do now?
we can't leave town now. Let's find a place to hide.
without your help we couldn't have done it.
please don't mention it.
the pleasure is all mine, ma'am.
you sound so polite.
now you've got manners.
and you are...
my name is Kom.
it's very nice to meet a beauty with such brains.
please let me know your name.
in fact, he is just our apprentice spy.
just started.
not much experienced.
we need to find medicine for Zeena.
and I have to go back to my unit.
but I need to go to my hotel first.
I will accompany you.
Hey, what about Zeena?
Zeena...
let Kom take care of her.
we can trust him.
please take good care of her.
she has a fever.
I'll be back as soon as possible.
we failed to catch those thieves.
this is not tolerable for the Emperor's army.
if anybody can catch them he'll be rewarded.
we're so glad you rescued Zeena.
thank you.
we owe the Thai Thieves.
actually, we need more co-operation from others.
when will I get my orders to leave here?
not now.
you'll wait for the Japs' gold to come through this area.
gold?
why this area?
we are trying to find out.
but more in-depth information is needed.
be careful.
your cover has been blown.
I'll be in touch.
now we have a ready-made scapegoat.
just send in your men disguised as the Thai Thieves.
end of story.
what if they know about this?
I'll be caught between a rock and a hard place.
don't worry.
we'll have taken the gold far away by then.
no one can stop us.
pack your stuff. We have to leave.
Toh...
the wanted spies left the town.
I heard they are heading this way.
this way?
are you the Allies' spies?
who are you?
I'm Toh Teen Nak head of the Thai Thieves in this area.
then you know these guys?
which guys?
Oh, may I have a word with you?
what's the matter?
I'm not sure if these guys are on my side.
do you mean the round one?
with the long chain?
the one that plays music?
that's mine!
Hey! Catch them!
don't come any closer.
I'll kill her.
what's going on?
No!
so who are you really?
wait.
who the hell are you?
Where're you from? Who are your parents?
how is your picture in this newspaper?
how did you get involved?
I told you
I've been to the south looking for work.
boss. -What?
they left only some clothes.
damm it! Didn't you watch them?
I watched them, sir.
then how could they escape?
go! Go!
we got a message that the Japs are carrying gold on the train.
if so, we need the help of the Thai Thieves.
we need to stop the Japs.
definitely.
then you will see how much we can disrupt the Japanese troops.
just wait and see how we grind them to pieces!
get rid of him.
wait!
don't you want to know what my double plan is?
what?
not the double plan!
you show off too much.
anyway, what is your double plan?
where will you take me?
I'm exhausted!
being with me is that annoying?
you haven't stopped whingding at all!
Yes.
I can go anywhere with anyone that is not a liar!
help! Somebody help!
if you go on shouting
I'll kiss you and then kill you!
understand?
didn't your right hand man come with you?
that bastard Chua!
I haven't seen him for days.
are you sure they're gonna come this way?
if you don't trust me, who else are you gonna trust?
I won't stab you in the back the way your people did to you.
if he thinks he's gonna stab me in the back he better think again!
quick! Make it quick!
come on! Quick!
Hey! Stop it!
what the hell's the matter?
Lam!
Oh, it's Toh. You bastard.
you keep opposing the Japs!
I'm not Japanese!
why the hell do you oppose me?
you don't have to tell me.
you don't look Japanese.
and you're not one of my Thai Thieves either!
I'll ask you frankly.
why do you pretend you are one of us?
I wear the same things as the villagers around here.
I'm not faking.
you have two choices.
either you leave the gold here or you leave your life here.
pick one!
all right.
Lam...
you should tell your men to drop their guns.
Kom, you asshole.
sorry...
I have to do it for my country.
what?
drop your guns.
are you Toh?
I've known about you for so long but today is the first time I got to see your ugly face.
I'd like to say you are the best.
and you are...
I'm General Sun a member of the Free Thai Movement.
I'm in charge of carrying and using the gold you stole from the Japanese to eliminate the Japanese from our kingdom.
these are Kom Wang Hin and Yai Tarua ...my spies.
so we have the same mission.
since we both oppose Japan -You don't have to worry. -It's fine.
so let's not waste the time. Please do me a favour.
please ask your men to put the gold in my car
I have to carry the gold back to Bangkok by tonight.
no need to say 'please' at all.
don't mention it.
I'll take care of it, sir.
let's get the gold into the General's car.
you must be Agent Patty.
and you, Agent Zeena.
it's my pleasure to meet you.
don't worry.
Dr. Pratuang wouldn't have got a degree without copying me in the exam.
it's my pleasure, Zeena.
if it weren't wartime.
I would ask you to go the temple fair.
excuse me.
we'd better hurry or we won't get back to Bangkok in time.
mind your own business!
excuse me...
I hope we will see each other again.
we really need to hurry.
why didn't you tell me you're with the Free Thai Movement?
why did you make it more complicated?
I didn't tell you the truth because I wanted to be sure of who is on my side.
Zeena...
are you happy I'm not a bad guy?
I don't feel anything.
why not?
why do I have to be happy?
you once told me you are uneasy with a bad guy.
so from now on you don't have to be uneasy with a good guy like me.
what is your next destination then?
don't know.
need to wait for the order from the Unit.
but perhaps I may go to Europe.
Europe?
it's very dangerous there now.
Why?
you care about me?
no, I'm just worried about the girls there.
all right...
see you next time the country needs us.
okay.
so you only lied to me because you were following orders?
Yes.
fine.
hope next time we meet you won't have to lie any more.
I didn't imagine it would be that easy.
if I'd gone into acting
I'd be a superstar by now.
Yes.
if you were the hero
I would be the heroine, sir.
just kidding, sir.
you're creepy!
I won't let it happen again, sir.
captain...
wake up!
now is no time to take a nap!
where are we?
what's the hell's up with you, Yai?
you changed cars four or five times!
why the hell are you stopping on the bridge?
I hope the car doesn't break down because only you can drive this bloody car!
I suggest we change the way to carry the gold.
around here the Japs are everywhere.
there's no other way! Will we go down a mousehole?
no, we'll go that way!
this way!
just two boxes left.
make it quick!
hey Baldy, what're you looking at?
what are you doing? Give them a hand!
no.
captain, go help them!
but I have only one uniform, sir.
would you rather be handsome or disgustingly rich?
the river is very deep.
won't the gold rust?
all ten boxes are here, sir.
good.
what can I do on this stupid raft?
still, once I get off all my dreams will be waiting.
wake up! Are those your guys?
why do they have to come this way?
I'm not sure, sir.
how come you're not sure?
it's your plan.
are you a ghost or what?
we don't play trick or treat!
I'll kick you in the bollocks!
behind us.
are you saving the bullets for your father?
what the hell?
wait! Wait!
there's only me left. Let's negotiate.
we're seizing their raft.
the gold is ours now.
we are rich!
general...
where is the gold?
these are stones!
where is the Japanese gold?
search the place!
search everywhere!
find the gold!
otherwise...
you'll be eating these stones for dinner!
can't you stop whingding!
how can l? You're wasting my time!
stones! My dream is over!
leave it to me!
give me a hand!
move your ass.
do you have a few seconds?
it's all right.
let's speak Thai.
you seem to have a business mind.
I was a gold dealer before the war.
I'll invite you to have a drink with me some time.
my pleasure.
now...
we have one Japanese on our side.
but I can't do everything by myself.
I'm really up against it so if you both can help me that'd be great.
I've already had the gold transportation route changed.
now it's up to you.
the horror of the Second World War brought long miserable days to many.
but there were people who took chances and made themselves rich out of war.
No! I'm ticklish!
that suitcase is mine, isn't it?
do you want to count it?
no. I trust you and I'm in a hurry.
it's a pleasure working with you.
please keep in touch.
so we can work together again.
no problem, bro.
Bye.
whispering CORRIDORS
this is Hur Eun-Young. I can't answer the phone, so leave your message.
2nd year, 3rd year...
2nd year, 3rd year...
2nd year, 3rd year...
Mrs. Park, you're still here?
had to check something.
I'll be leaving soon.
guess the new semester's keeping you busy.
need any help?
I'm fine.
library
Hello?
Eun-Young?
Mrs. Park?
JIN-JU is here.
Jin-Ju?
I don't know.
what are you talking about?
JIN-JU has died for sure. But she's here.
Jin-Ju's been in school for 9 years.
Mrs. Park...
Eun-Young? Hello?
what are you doing here?
uh? Waiting for you.
what?
what did you say?
I was waiting for you.
for me? Why?
why were you waiting for me?
we're the class clerks of the week.
youn Yae-Yi, trying to make me feel guilty eh?
I'm actually 15 minutes early, thanks to my mom.
of course you're not, I'm a bit early.
we never promised to meet here.
you should have waited in the classroom. It's cold.
empty classrooms give me the creeps, sorry...
stop moping.
you'll jinx my chance of spending this senior year in style.
want to become a schoolgate ghost? Come on.
I'm not sure, only that she's possessed.
possessed?
you know, by a grade ghost. One with a low IQ though.
were you good friends?
does she look like she would like me?
Oh, I forgot to bring a rag.
Hey!
what?
give me that you dufus. No need to take those back up.
hurry up.
Ji-Oh.
it is your duty as her students.
anyone who damages her reputation with rumors will never be forgiven.
you heard.
don't distract the other students with gossip, understand?
it's all for the best, Okay?
fortunately, we're swearing this oath of honor... ...before all hell breaks loose.
you'll all be held responsible if anything happens.
got it.
yes sir.
got it.
yes sir.
you'll take the blame for rumors coming from Rm. 3. Understood!
yes sir.
why did she do it?
it's not clear. The police needs more leads.
you could kill yourself for any reason...but why do it at school?
I'm sorry.
the principal will assign a new homeroom teacher for Rm3.
special instructions will be given.
but make sure this is kept confidential.
Hey! Are you sure?
ever see me tell a lie?
Yeah.
this is for real.
suicide?
not all suicides are by hanging. This case stinks.
most of the students wanted to kill old fox.
JIN-JU is here.
isn't it a family heirloom? Thanks Jin-Ju.
is your Dad still drinking a lot?
I don't know.
don't be so cold.
did you hear? Jung-Sook was the first to be here.
Yeah, and she wasn't even the clerk of the week.
she was there even before the clerks.
remember last weeks shouting match with Old Fox?
making out you two?
or stay at home. You hear?
degenerates.
look at your uniform. Hands out.
you're such a bad influence.
what's this smell? Incense?
it figures. Having a Shaman for a mother.
miss Hur.
miss Hur...
a penny for your thoughts.
you weren't answering.
Oh, were you calling me?
you're the only teacher by that last name.
sorry, I still feel like a student here.
Really?
her death must have shocked you.
she said she had something to check. I assumed it was important.
what was she checking?
I'm not sure, but she was staring at her class agenda book.
Jin-Ju's died for sure.
but she's here. Jin-Ju's been in school for 9 years.
it's not you.
I just don't feel like it. So childish.
do it on your own.
nobody else can call the spirits.
just this one time. Please?
Oh mighty spirit, come to us...
draw us a circle if you are with us.
draw us a circle if she is a virgin. An X if she is not.
having fun?
get your asses over here.
what the fuck is Mad Dog doing in our class?
hasn't senior year put some sense into you?
if you're so psychic, make a living out of it.
why bother with school?
I asked her for my grades.
lim Ji-Oh, are you a Shaman or a witch doctor?
then get better grades. You're lowering the class average.
get out of my sight.
who is it?
who's the smart ass who just laughed?
I see... everyone on your desks, now.
I'll teach you a lesson. Arms up!
can't you greet your new homeroom teacher with respect?
homeroom teacher?
due to personal matters, Mrs. Park is unable to continue her duties.
I will be taking over, you hear?
this means two things.
one, a better chance at getting into college.
two, no personal life for a year.
the new semester of your senior year... is getting you somewhat excited...
I advise you to get rid of such cheap sentimentalisms.
they're luxuries a senior should do without.
got it!
my motto is: KEEP YOUR OWN PLACE.
this will be the class motto from now on.
you're each other's rival, but frankly speaking you're each other's enemy.
the worst enemy in war is yourself. You can defeat your inner enemy.
you can be a winner.
I've re-scheduled the exercise exams for tomorrow. Be prepared.
get used to it and stop whining!
it's for evaluation purposes, so relax.
class dismissed. Start cleaning up.
dang, wish we had exams every day.
what?
then school ends early.
bitch, exams never kept you from leaving early.
you're always the first to dive outta da classroom.
it's better to chill after the exams...
bullshit!
ow, ouch.
stuck?
Aw, fuck. It's blocked.
didn't we get pierced on the same day?
Ouch.
stop whining bitch. ...see it's going in.
stop it, it hurts.
I'm trying to take it out you slut. Want a bloody slit up your nose?
Hey!
whatcha lookin at?
huh, are you ignoring me?
what's all the fuss?
you psychic, mind your own business!
Hur Eun-Young
I'll ask them to replace the missing yearbooks.
so you're an alumni.
how did you know?
you were pretty famous as the student with looks and brains.
my grades were so so, and the yearbook shows prettier girls.
why did you choose to be a teacher?
I guess it's not so bad after all.
can I drop the formalities when we're alone?
if you insist.
the teachers often compare us together.
but they say I'm prettier and smarter.
you're definitely prettier, but do you also get good grades?
Yes, I'm applying for Seoul National University.
what major?
does it matter? After all, it's the best.
there must be something that interests you.
nothing special. Besides I hate studying.
once I get admitted, I'm done with books.
an SNU degree is a gold card for everything.
even with an SNU degree, it wouldn't hurt reading Joyce.
how come you're still here? Aren't you going home?
I didn't have the chance...to thank you in the toilet.
you like to do girly things, don't you?
thanks anyway.
have a seat.
practicing for art school?
Nope. I'm supposed to have no talent...
how would you know?
my mom said...it's a waste of time.
she's right.
this is just for fun.
can I see?
no. It's embarrassing.
I guess it is embarrassing.
you're breaking my heart. Okay, I'll show it to you.
I told you so.
why paint something so scary?
school can be a horrific experience... for both students and teachers.
like witnessing a tragic death.
do you get it?
I guess that's why I can't erase... the image of Old Fox from my head.
it's like an inspiration.
terrific.
what is?
you are. You speak like an artist.
you're kidding. I can't even paint.
of course you can. You need to improve your skills...
but you know how to control light.
bad paintings drain the life out of their objects...
because they lack this quality.
this painting has it. You have a good eye for things, the most important element to be a good painter.
you must have studied painting.
a bit.
when? In Junior high?
something like that. I quit though.
no talent like you know who.
Jae-Ji, will you teach me how to paint?
you can join me when you get bored of teaching.
no?
I...
is it a yes or no?
allright, if you insist. Promise that you do as I say.
now you sound like Mad Dog. We're mortal enemies.
don't tell me your his niece?
isn't this great Jin-Ju?
miss Hur.
what are you doing at my desk?
is this your desk?
Yes.
what brings you to our classroom?
this used to be my senior year homeroom. Brings back memories.
it's still pretty much the same.
I didn't do that.
I know...I did it.
was this your desk?
no, it was my friend's, Jin-Ju's.
excuse me.
JIN-JU, this will be your desk forever.
here.
I found her address in my diary. I want to meet her family.
I explain later. It's really important that you find it.
I'll drop by later to get it. Bye mom.
looking for an old flame?
no, a girlfriend from high school.
lost touch after graduation?
kind of.
can't call that friendship.
guess it happens when you're busy.
she died in high school.
Oh the student who committed suicide? Was she your friend?
yes you were in Mrs. Park's class.
but why are you looking for her family?
just curious.
go to the school storage room.
her ghost haunts the place. You'll get to meet her in person.
a couple of girls claim they've seen the ghost.
she died in the art room. It used to be the art room.
she must have jinxed the place.
construction workers have been sick or hurt.
that's why they can't tear down the place.
of all the places to die why choose school?
lim Ji-Oh, you piece of shit!
the VP almost had a heart attack when he found this in the art room.
how would you explain this?
answer me! Are you trying to fuck with me?
no sir.
don't bullshit me!
you degenerate.
you must be a psycho, a maniac. Some parents you must have.
letting you create such a monstrosity.
get out of my sight. You disgust me!
go.
go! Go!
go! Go! Go!
I dare you.
you psycho.
you wanna die?
die! Die! You filth...
I told your mom not to worry.
she's sensitive about your first exam as a senior.
if you have finished, I would like to excuse...
what's the hurry?
I should get back to my books.
don't be a stranger to your own teacher.
a woman should be like cotton candy. Understand?
So-Young.
So-Young. Do you know where I can find that painting of your classmate's?
it must've been trashed. Mad Dog chewed it to pieces.
mad Dog?
I apologize. That's what we call Mr. Oh.
shouldn't it be pervert?
who's painting is it?
lim Ji-Oh...
I see...
it's for the best. No more painting for me.
giving up painting?
nowhere to paint.
there's one place. The teachers will never know.
never mind.
what?
let's go.
where? I was just joking.
you can't go there.
why not?
it's a mess, cobwebs and rats.
we'll just take a look.
are you nuts? The place is haunted.
then stay here. I'll check for ghosts, okay?
who taught you to smoke?
no one. Ever see me learn from anyone?
how brave of you. Even the teachers are scared of this place.
I prefer ghosts.
besides, didn't you know. I'm one myself.
so is this that infamous place?
then lend me some space. I need a place to paint.
I've been banned from the art room.
don't you want to kill him?
Yeah, why don't you do the honors?
you have to pay rent. Finders keepers you know.
plus I'll keep my mouth shut.
rent?
aren't you supposed to be a rich bitch?
I'm sorry.
I came to ask you something and the door was open.
it's okay. Have a seat.
miss Hur, no need to feel guilty.
Wow,... someone did quite a number on this.
why bring it here?
I was curious. But the faculty lounge...
it is uncomfortable there.
I guess I still feel like a student.
think so? Perhaps it's more than that.
do you usually sketch student faces?
I like their expressions.
didn't you have something to ask?
Uh...about this painting.
hello there.
you were saying.
I was in the art club when I was in high school.
so you used to paint.
no, I sculpted faces in plaster.
Sculpted?
I used to do friend's faces as a hobby.
must have been a great gift.
I hope they were.
excuse me.
just a moment, Ji-Oh.
here.
take it.
don't give up painting.
class motto: KEEP YOUR PLACE
park So-Young. School rank, 1st place.
go ahead and give her a big hand.
kim Jung-Sook.
your class rank is 2nd place, yet your school rank is 25th.
what's the use of studying long hours if you're not paying attention.
if you don't have the brains, ask So-Young for some tips.
class head.
Yes.
hand them out after I'm gone. Dismissed!
attention.
don't bother.
how can the class with the school's best student have the worst score?
don't greet me until you improve the class average, you hear!
do you have Mrs. Park's class agenda book?
no, but perhaps the PE teacher would know.
night patrolling with female teachers...
the perfect solution for lonely nights.
what do you think? Not bad eh?
what's wrong?
too much dust. Look.
you have a vain side to you, don't you?
aren't you scared of this place? Ghosts and all...
on the contrary, I feel at ease. Like home.
Really?
Why? Don't you?
anything you say.
strange.
God damn it!
what the...ow!
who's there?
who are you?
order.
I'll be filling in for Mr. Oh today. So behave.
he didn't come in today?
is anything wrong?
how should I know?
kim Nuri.
Choi An-Nat...
here.
he must have fallen asleep in the sauna.
nothing can wake you there.
you think a ghost got him?
kim Yung-Sook, Kim Yung-Sook.
is that her seat?
yes Sir.
is she absent or late?
she hasn't come in yet.
what gives? She's never late.
it was Mad Dog's turn. The ghost got him.
I'm positive.
where did you get that from?
do I still look like your friend?
hey...
stop it.
look, isn't that Jung-Sook?
I'm sure he was killed last night.
what makes you think so?
I feel it. Just like the day Old Fox died.
I feel like I killed Mad Dog myself.
you think I was possessed...and murdered Mad Dog?
whoever did it, aren't you glad that he's gone?
look, I'm not joking. I'm serious.
what if I'm really possessed?
Ji-Oh, don't be so serious.
don't worry. He's a die-hard. He must be playing hooky.
do as I say Eun-Young. You'll thank me one day.
you won't regret it. You need to choose your friends.
she's no good for you.
looking for this?
yes...
what for?
it's only going to depress you.
name; LIM JI-OH
"evaluation NOTES"
"lacks THE ABILITY AND WILL TO APPLY FOR COLLEGE"
Oh, it's you So-Young.
any problems?
No,... nothing.
did you say there were spare yearbooks?
no, they suddenly disappeared. So stupid.
so typical of the school system.
have you found the painting?
huh?
of Ji-Oh's. You wanted to see it.
Oh yes, I did. Do you know Ji-Oh well?
not much. She sits next to me.
Why?
nothing special, apart from her ability to call the spirits.
call the spirits?
probably her way of getting attention.
if you're so curious, she's in the store room, painting...
what's this noise?
what are you doing?
get your ass over here.
now. I said now!
what brings you here?
so now you're following me.
forget it.
I have nothing against you. Never avoided you either.
let's just say we're different.
meet me after evening studies.
Why?
can't we talk now?
is your sister coming to pick you up?
sister?
sorry, was that your stepmother?
she looks so young.
kim Jung-Sook，
mind your own business.
is your real mom still in the looney bin?
bitch. To think I took pity on you.
you think you could beat me? Guess again.
you don't have what it takes. We're different.
got it? Loser!
your Mother will save you. After all she's a shaman.
I never spread those rumors about your mom.
it was Mrs. Park who told me.
I was scared of being ostracized for taking your side.
I never thought that anything bad would happen...
she threatened to expel you for my sake, if I kept seeing you...
I was afraid.
I'm so sorry Jin-Ju.
to MY BEST FRIEND, EUN-YOUNG, FROM JIN-JU
does it look like you Jin-Ju? Don't ever loose it.
I told you I'm Ji-Oh.
then where did you get those bells?
a friend gave them to me.
JIN-JU is dead.
this is where she died 9 years ago. I saw her body with my own eyes.
she couldn't have given those bells to you.
what are you talking about? These are from Jae-Yi. Yoon Jae-Yi.
what's wrong? What happened?
to MY BEST FRIEND, JIN-JU, FROM EUN-YOUNG, 89
we used to be close during our freshman year.
we would share our most private secrets.
the teachers started comparing us and we drifted apart.
she became distant，
I never reached out to her...
but...
but, I never thought... it would come to this.
it's all my fault.
Kang HYUN-JOO
park JI-SUNG
you should never have returned.
"EUN-YOUNG HAS RETURNED AS A TEACHER"
"once AGAIN MRS. PARK HAS BECOME THE HOMEROOM TEACHER"
"JI-OH HASN'T DESERTED ME"
you're not Jae-Yi, nor are you Jin-Ju.
you're not Eun Young.
I've always been and still am Eun-Young.
you can never be the old Eun-Young.
you'll become just like Old Fox.
you're wrong.
I'm still Jin-Ju's friend, Eun-Young.
it's no use now.
I don't want to hurt you, but I don't have a choice.
Jae-Yi.
you could never kill me.
without you, I can continue being a student.
stop it...
what good would it do? You're a ghost, not a student anymore!
at first, I just wanted to have a yearbook.
but then I wanted more. I needed a friend who really understood and cared about me...
but not this way!
you're not human!
I only had to keep the classroom full, like these desks.
nothing more.
for the past 9 years, no one suspected my identity.
nobody cared if I was there or not.
whether I was human or not, it didn't matter.
I just had to fill the empty seats and be there during headcounts.
I understand.
but you have to stop now.
you don't get it now that you're a teacher...
what happened to you will never happen again.
it always has and always will.
trust me Jin-Ju. I'll do my best.
I will. Trust me.
there's only so much a teacher can do.
stop it Jae-Yi. Stop!
I don't care if you're a ghost or not.
but you've gone too far this time.
don't worry Ji-Oh. Everything will go back to normal.
we can never...go back.
don't worry Ji-Oh.
you have to stop.
I can't let you continue harming the teachers, for my sake.
I've waited so long for you.
I can't give up now.
stop!
it's no use Ji-Oh.
lay a finger on her and I'm gone.
stop the horrors. I can understand you now.
but the bloodshed has to end.
so many things I wanted to do.
I pined for a friend who would reach out to me...
now I've met that friend...
I love you too, really.
but please stop... leave the rest to us.
rest in peace Jae-Yi.
I never intended to hurt anyone. I just wanted a friend...
and leave with good memories. That's all...
I can't stay like this...
cause I'm not human.
I'm so sorry.
we'll never forget you.
I got some frightful pressure from the American ambassador at that drinkies do last night.
Ah. They'd heard about my cancelling Trident.
Ah.
the American defence industries are big contributors to the President Party funds.
Ah. He said we had a big problem in East Yemen.
ah?
stop saying " ah " like that, Bernard. I'm not your doctor.
I'm sorry. What is this big problem?
Ah...
thank you, Bernard. I'll try to find out.
he muttered about St George's Island.
St George's Island?
Yes. There is a St George's Island, isn't there?
Yes, it's in the Commonwealth.
Ah, I see, yes. That St George's Island.
apparently, he's afraid Communists might try to grab it.
what did you say?
I said I'd ask the Foreign Office. What did he say?
the White House thinks the Foreign Office is full of pinkos and traitors.
no, it's not. Well, not full.
they don't want the Reds to get a strategic base like St George's Island.
he spoke about putting tariffs on British exports to the USA and taxing US investment to Britain, causing a run on the pound.
well, you are seeing the Foreign Secretary this afternoon.
can't you get the Foreign Secretary to sort it out?
after all, they are on our side.
who are? The Americans.
I thought you meant the Foreign Office.
what's the Foreign Office worried about then, Dick?
have you got the Foreign Secretary eating out of your hand.
Oh, yes. Completely house-trained.
so what is the problem?
the Prime Minister's the problem.
he's starting to mistrust our advice.
he even questioned Foreign Office policy. Surely not!
we even see a danger the Cabinet may pursue its own foreign policy.
but that's absurd.
the country can't have two foreign policies
quite. And the PM's getting far too keen on keeping the White House happy.
dear, oh, dear. So, how can I help?
there are a couple of things coming up where he might need guiding in the right direction.
one is St George's Island. Ah. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
remind me, would you, Dick?
as you know, it's one of the few islands in the Indian Ocean to stay in the Commonwealth after the Independence.
Oh, yes, that's right. It's quite democratic.
Yes. Free elections and everything.
but there's a group of Marxist guerrillas in the mountains.
we are getting reports that they're planning a coup.
well, these things will happen.
they're not thinking of starting it on their own.
east Yemen is helping.
isn't that a democracy?
people's Democratic Republic of East Yemen.
Oh, I see. It's a Communist dictatorship.
and the guerrillas are Soviet-backed, aren't they?
Yes, and Libyan-backed.
obviously, we in the Foreign Office are staying right out of it.
obviously.
it would only upset a load of frontline African states.
and we don't want to antagonise the Soviets.
quite. And we've just landed a huge contract to build a new St George's airport and harbour.
if we back the wrong side, we may lose it.
we don't mind which side wins, the democrats or the Marxists?
why should we? But you see the problem.
if the PM gets into one of his ghastly patriotic Churchillian moods, he may intervene.
all that pro-British, defending democracy nonsense.
Oh, I know, I know.
he must understand that once you start interfering in the internal squabbles of other countries, you're on a very slippery slope.
even the Foreign Secretary's grasped that.
Really? So what was the other point?
the Arabs have put down a motion at the United Nations condemning Israel.
naturally, we'll vote on the Arab side. Naturally.
but I gather the PM wants us to abstain.
surely not! Why?
something about the PLO starting it this time, faults on both sides. Sentimental nonsense.
sucking up to the Americans, as always.
just help him to realise that, as far as foreign affairs are concerned, his job is to confine himself to the hospitality and ceremonial role.
I'll do my best, but you know what happens when politicians get into Number 10.
they want their place on the world stage.
people on stages are called actors.
all they're required to do is look plausible, stay sober and say the lines they're given in the right order
some of them try to make up their own lines
they don't last long.
the American ambassador had a word with me last night.
about what? What do you know about St George's Island?
what do you know about it?
well, you're the Foreign Secretary, not me!
is there any danger of a Communist takeover?
well, did he say there was? He hinted.
no. No chance at all. No chance at all.
the Foreign Office would have told me.
you're sure they always tell you everything?
well, everything they think I should know.
that's what I'm afraid of.
the Americans are worried and we can't afford to upset them at the moment.
I'm sure we've got everything under control.
Chamberlain thought Hitler was under control.
Ah, well, Chamberlain.
Eden thought Nasser was under control.
the F. O. doesn't know what it's doing?
no, they don't tell us what they're doing!
absurd. They give me a full answer to any questions I ask.
and the ones you don't ask? Such as?
such as about St George's Island.
Ah, well, I don't ask those.
well, just ask them. For me. All right?
Yes, of course. If that is what you want
but don't foget.
once you interfere in other countries' internal squabbles, you're on a very slippery slope.
anything else?
Yes, I gather we're proposing to vote against
israel in the UN tonight. Why?
they bombed the PLO.
the PLO bombed Israel.
but the Israelis dropped more bombs than the PLO!
the PLO started it!
no, they didn't.
it seems to me there are faults on both sides.
not according to my advice.
america is worried. They want us to abstain.
I don't think we could do that.
why not? The Foreign Office wouldn't wear it.
are they here to follow our instructions or are we to follow theirs?
now, don't be silly.
prime Minister, Sir Humphrey's here.
prime Minister. Humphrey, I'm worried.
Oh, what about, Prime Minister?
about the Americans.
well, we're all worried about the Americans.
foreign affairs are a complicated business, aren't they?
Yes, That's why we leave it to the Foreign Office.
I've got to keep in with the Americans for the next few months if I'm to cancel our defence order.
Ah. I gather that they're worried about us.
of course they are, but I know how to keep in with them.
how? Don't cancel the huge defence order.
no, Humphrey, I'm determined on that, but we mustn't upset them in any other way.
the ambassador mentioned St George's Island.
Oh, really? What's going on in that part of the world?
what part of the world?
that part. The part where St George's Island is.
what part is that?
I suggest you go and have a look at the map!
no, I do know, Prime Minister.
good. Then we both know.
the White House is worried it might be taken over by Marxists.
it's not funny, Humphrey.
no, indeed. Rather touching, really.
prime Minister, once you start interfering in the internal squabbles of other countries, you're on a very slippery slope.
that's what the Foreign Secretary said.
extraordinary.
then there's the U. N. vote on Israel tonight.
the Americans want us to abstain.
it's a question of maintaining our relationship with the Arabs.
the power of Islam.
oil supplies.
I'm talking about what's right and wrong.
well, don't let the Foreign Office hear you.
if you insist on an even-handed approach, the Foreign Office might agree to abstaining, so long as you authorise our man there to make a powerful speech attacking Zionism.
surely we should promote peace, harmony, goodwill.
well, it would be most unusual.
the U. N. is the accepted forum for the expression of international hatred.
and defending democracy on St George's?
not if it harms us by upsetting our friends.
britain should not support law and justice?
of course we should. Prime Minister.
we just shouldn't let it affect our foreign policy, that's all.
we must fight for the weak against the strong.
then send troops to Afghanistan to fight the Russians.
the Russians are too strong.
what was that about law and justice?
I want assurances sent to the Prime Minister of St George's Island that Britain will stand by him.
discuss this with the Foreign Secretary.
thank you, Humphrey.
thank you, Prime Minister. You've been a great help
Bernard? Yes, Prime Minister?
where exactly is St George's Island?
shall we look at the globe?
there is one in the private office. Good idea.
good afternoon, Luke. Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
now, where is it?
it's here, in the Arabian Sea. Near the Persian Gulf.
the lifeline of the West.
there's Afghanistan, now under Soviet control.
only 400 miles north of the Arabian Sea.
if the Soviets ever took Pakistan...Which they wouldn't.
if they did, they'd control the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean.
they've always wanted a " warm water port " .
they wouldn't invade Pakistan.
the Americans have a fleet permanently stationed here.
the Indian Ocean.
prime Minister, may I have a word about...home affairs?
home affairs? Yes.
can't you wait? We're discussing foreign affairs.
no, Prime Minister, it's rather urgent.
are you all right, Bernard?
Yes, Prime Minister. Please.
very well. Excuse me, Luke.
what on earth's the matter?
I don't want to be disloyal, but it wasn't a good idea to continue that conversation in front of Luke. Security.
he's your colleague, one of my private secretaries.
what is MI6 up to...?
not that sort of risk. He works for the F. O.
he works for me.
eh. yes, but he's not only your man from the Foreign Office, he's also their man in Number 10.
he's a plant.
do you understand? Yes. No!
the F. O. is keeping something from me? Yes.
what? I don't know. They're keeping it from me, too.
then how do you know? I don't know.
you just said the F. O. was keeping something from me.
how do you know if you don't know?
I don't know specifically what, but I do know they always keep everything from everybody.
it's normal practice. Who does know?
may I just clarify the question?
you are asking who would know what it is that I don't know and you don't know but the F. O. know that they know that they are keeping from you so you don't know and they do know all we know is there is something we don't know and we want to know, but we don't know what because we don't know? Is that it?
may I clarify the question?
who knows Foreign Office secrets apart from the Foreign Office?
Oh, that's easy. Only the Kremlin.
this bother about St George's Island is getting to be a bore.
we made the real mistake giving them their independence.
wasn't that right? Wind of change and all?
Yes, but not that way. We should have partitioned the island.
like we did in India, Cyprus and Palestine? And Ireland?
Yes, that was our invariable practice with the colonies.
it always worked.
but didn't partition always lead to civil war?
as in India, Cyprus, Palestine and Ireland.
Yes, but it kept them busy.
instead of fighting other people, they fought each other.
Yes, rather good. Saved us having a policy. Cheers.
sir Humphrey? Yes, Bernard?
um, Sir Humphrey... Yes, Bernard?
could I have a word? Yes, Bernard?
with both of you. Yes. What about?
St George's. What now?
the PM seems to be completely in the dark.
good. Excellent. Anything else?
I wonder, is there anything he doesn't know?
I hardly know where to begin, Bernard.
no, I mean anything important.
he has the Foreign Secretary to tell him.
he seems to think he doesn't know either.
I should hope not!
are you implying that he ought to know what is happening?
well, he is the Prime Minister.
Bernard, it's simply too dangerous to let politicians become involved with diplomacy.
diplomacy is about surviving until the next century.
politics is about surviving to the Friday afternoon!
there are 157 independent countries in the world.
we've dealt with them for years.
there's hardly an MP who knows anything.
show them a map of the world, most have a job finding the Isle of Wight.
surely politicians can't be that ignorant?
very well. Sit down, Bernard.
where is the Upper Volta? Em...
what's the capital of Chad? Um...
what language do they speak in Mali? Em...
who's the president of Peru? Um...
what is the national religion of Cameroon?
em... Bernard?
you should stand for Parliament.
no, what I mean is if it's a democracy, shouldn't people sort of discuss things a bit?
of course. Full discussion. And have the facts?
of course not!
they don't want them. Facts complicate things.
all the press, the people and their elected leaders want to know is who are the goodies and baddies.
the interests of Britain nearly always involve doing deals with people they think are baddies.
and not helping the goodies occasionally.
so we avoid discussion of foreign affairs.
or rather we keep it inside the Foreign Office then we produce one policy for the Foreign Secretary, which is our considered view.
and he can act upon it.
no options? No alternatives? None.
what if he's not satisfied?
if pressed, we look at it again.
and come up with a different view?
of course not! We come up with the same view.
what if he demands options? It's obvious.
the F. O. present him with three options, two of which are, in fact, exactly the same.
and the third is totally unacceptable.
like bombing Warsaw or invading France.
we occasionally encourage the Foreign Secretary to produce his own policy, then we tell him it will inevitably lead to World War Three, perhaps within 48 hours.
I see. I'm sorry to appear stupid...
Oh, perish the thought, Bernard.
in my experience, ministers are concerned about the effect of policy on domestic opinion.
our system doesn't seem to allow for that.
of course not. We take the global view.
we ask what's best for the world.
most ministers would ask what will the " Daily Mail " say!
we can't have foreign policy made by yobbos like Fleet Street editors or backbench MPs!
or Cabinet ministers. Or Cabinet ministers.
we take the right decisions and let them sort out the politics later.
yes? Yes, come in, Mrs Whitmore. Thank you.
if the Foreign Secretary won't accept this...?
it's a free country. He can always resign.
how can you treat the PM like this?
surely he is right to worry about St George's IS.
after all, It is the democracy!
not for long.
this is the fresh telegram.
the East Yemen are preparing to invade in support of the Marxist guerrillas.
that's awful. Yes and no.
it is moderately bad news for the government of St George's, but very good for the guerrillas.
what about the islanders?
Bernard, you're reacting like a politician.
what are we going to do to help them? Nothing.
what if St George's appeals to us?
we'll give them every support, short of help.
what if the Prime Minister insists that we help them?
then we follow the four-stage strategy.
what's that?
the standard F. O. response in a time of crisis.
in stage one we say nothing is going to happen.
stage two, it may happen, but we should do nothing.
stage three, maybe we should do something about it, but there's nothing we can do.
stage four, maybe there was something we could have done, but it's too late now.
afternoon telegrams, Prime Minister.
thank you, Luke.
Where's Bernard? I think he's with Sir Humphrey.
troop movements in East Yemen? It's not significant.
the American ambassador mentioned it.
Really? I'm surprised he'd heard of it.
what are they up to?
just preparing a regular raid on West Yemen.
nothing for us to worry about?
nothing at all. Prime Minister
he said something about St George's, too.
Really? Educated man.
for an American.
is there a problem there?
no, no, no. Prime Minister, Just the normal local squabbles.
he seems worried about a Communist take it over.
americans always are.
Luke! Have you read this?
we voted against Israel in the U. N. last night!
Yes, Prime Minister.
but I gave express instructions to abstain.
I think not. Prime Minister
I said I felt very strongly that we should not take sides.
the Foreign Secretary noted your feeling.
but did nothing about it!
with respect, Prime Minister, he did.
he asked our U. N. ambassador if we should consider abstaining.
what did he do? He said no.
you mean the Foreign Office can simply ignore the Prime Minister?
certainly not, Prime Minister. No.
they take full account of you when coming to their decision, but events move rapidly.
there were important factors in our relationship with the Arabs that were not known to you when you took your view.
we couldn't get through to you in time.
I am on the phone, you know.
it wasn't sufficiently important to wake you at 3 am.
it was extremely important! The White House will do its nut!
you could be telephoned before every U. N. vote, but there are two or three a night.
what can I do to reverse this?
nothing. That would be most embarrassing.
once stated, policy can't be retracted.
I'd like to talk to the Israeli ambassador.
I think not, Prime Minister.
I want to talk to the Israeli ambassador.
if I may say so, it would be rather unwise.
Luke! Can you hear me? Watch my lips!
I want to talk to the Israeli ambassador!
of course, Prime Minister, if that is your wish.
I will contact the Foreign Secretary and Sir Richard and then telephone the Israeli...
I don't want the Foreign Secretary and Sir Richard!
I just want the ambassador
prime Minister, it would be most improper to see him without the Foreign Secretary present.
Why? What do you think I want to talk to the ambassador about?
presumably the vote at the U. N.
Really? That would be most improper. Oh.
my daughter Lucy wishes to spend her next long vacation on a kibbutz.
or I should say, as she's at the University of Sussex, another kibbutz.
I see. The ambassador and I were at the LSE.
I thought I'd invite him to the flat tonight for a drink.
6 pm will be convenient. See to it, would you, Luke?
Yes, Prime Minister. Thank you.
don't be upset, Jim. It happens all the time.
I told them to abstain.
it's well known that in the British Foreign Office an instruction from the Prime Minister becomes a request from the Foreign Secretary, a recommendation from the Minister of State and, finally, a suggestion to the ambassador.
if it ever gets that far.
thank you. L'Chaim.
Cheers.
well, Jim, what are you going to do about St George's?
you know about that? Obviously.
not a serious problem, is it?
it isn't, yes. Your information must be better than mine.
mine comes from the Foreign Office.
What?!
so that's the connection.
your Foreign Office agreed with East Yemen that they'll make strong diplomatic representations, but do nothing.
in return, you keep your airport contract.
there will be uproar!
that's only the start.
I happen to know from our ambassador in Washington the Americans are going to support the present government of St George's .
in the U. N...? No, in battle. On St George's Island.
they are sending an airborne division backed up by the Seventh Fleet.
the American is invading a Commonwealth country?
the Palace will hit the roof. And I'll look ridiculous.
why didn't they tell me? They don't trust you.
why not？
because you trust the Foreign Office.
Oh, I see. What can I do about it?
Jim, you have an airborne battalion on standby in Germany that is not now needed for the NATO exercise.
how do you know? I know.
now, if you were to send it to St George's Island, it would frighten off East Yemen.
they'd never dare invade.
of course, it's not for the Israeli ambassador to advise the British Prime Minister.
and he wouldn't take your advice anyway.
get me the Foreign Secretary and the Defence Secretary.
I wonder why the Foreign Office didn't cover themselves.
maybe they did.
they gave me several boxes tonight.
I've been through them all except this one.
I wonder if this could be it.
'northern Indian Ocean Situation Report " .
it's 138 pages. It must be it.
Hello? Yes, Ronnie.
I want the president of St George's Island to invite Britain to send an airborne battalion on a goodwill visit.
no, just a friendly gesture. Goodwill.
Yes, at once, please. Thank you.
he seemed to think that 800 fully-armed paratroopers was an awful lot to send on a goodwill visit.
no, it's just an awful lot of goodwill.
Oh, yes, Paul. You know you have an airborne battalion on standby in Germany?
never mind how I know.
well, since it's not being used,
I want them to fly straight off to St George's Island.
sort of between Africa and India.
a goodwill visit. Just showing the flag.
they have been invited. Yes. Leave in...six hours.
Yes, an instant goodwill visit.
tell your press office to announce it at once.
no, no, leave me out of it. A routine visit.
all right. A routine surprise visit.
well, say they were invited earlier, but the NATO exercise got in the way.
now they're not needed, they're going.
all right. Nobody knows it's not true.
press statements aren't delivered under oath.
they'll be off at midnight.
I gather that there's an airborne battalion in the air.
sounds like the right place for it
I gather it's on its way to St George's.
Yes, it should land in two hours time.
isn't this all rather sudden?
I had a sudden friendly impulse. Humphrey
I wanted to spread a little goodwill.
there's not much goodwill in the F. O. this morning
Really? Why not?
it might be construed as provocative, sending a fully-armed airborne battalion into a trouble spot like that, an explosive situation.
explosive? I thought there was no problem there.
Eh...well, yes, indeed.
there is no problem, but it's explosive potentially.
Why? Moving troops is always potentially explosive.
we move them around Salisbury Plain.
is that potentially explosive?
there are a lot of unexploded shells on...
thank you, Bernard.
do tell me why the Foreign Office is worried.
I'm fascinated.
it's a sensitive part of the world. Unstable.
they always tell me how stable it is.
well, yes, indeed it is...very, but it's a sort of...unstable sort of stability.
excuse me, Sir Humphrey. Yes, Luke.
foreign Office telegrams. Prime Minister.
thank you, Luke. Oh, gosh. Rather a lot.
Yes, the somewhat unorthodox visit to St George's has stirred things up.
Ah, I see East Yemen is moving its troops back to base.
Yes, Prime Minister.
decided not to invade West Yemen after all?
so it seems. Oh, this is nice.
the Americans are delighted by our visit. That's good.
excellent, Prime Minister.
they say they are going to hold airborne division ready if we want reinforcements.
reinforcements of what?
reinforcements of goodwill, Humphrey.
may I inquire where the impulse for this little escapade came from?
of course you may. It came from Luke. Luke?!
from me?
it was you who put together that masterly Northern Indian Ocean Situation Report, wasn't it?
Yes, but it argued for not doing anything.
come off it, Luke. You can't fool me. What?!
I can read between the lines.
some politicians have a feeling for foreign affairs.
I knew you meant St George's needed support.
Oh, yes. Well, no, actually.
only in one paragraph on page 107.
it was enough. I can take the hint.
I'm giving you full credit for it.
I told the Foreign Secretary it was your warning sparked it off.
no, no, it wasn't You haven't?
and I don't think I'm giving away any secrets when I say you are going to be rewarded.
rewarded? Ambassador at a very important embassy.
which embassy? Tel Aviv.
Oh, my God! You can't send me to Israel.
think about my career.
don't be absurd. It's an honour. Promotion.
Yse, it will upset Israelis.
they won't want me.
they know I'm on the Arab side.
I thought you were on our side.
of course, yes, but...
we need somebody like you in Tel Aviv to explain why we always vote against them in the UN.
don't we, Humphrey?
Yes, Prime Minister.
l'm 100 yards from the top of Mt. Everest.
yet there's a part of me that can't wait to end this silly vacation...
...and get back to work, where the real challenges await.
shouldn't you take your age into consideration, sir?
after all, you're 82 years old.
am l 82?
these numbers mean nothing to me. My journey through life has just begun.
sir! Sir!
Oota tells me the storm's getting worse. -Very, very bad.
we must abandon our ascent and go down the mountain immediately.
we're so very close to the top, Mr. Puffy Jacket Man.
l'm heading down now, sir. l advise you to do the same.
all right, so be it.
see you at the staff meeting on Monday. And l'll bring the Krispy Kremes!
there, once again, the sad footage we've been watching all day.
a beloved visionary who turned a single radio station into a global media empire...
...Preston Blake, dead at 82. More after this.
you're watching the Blake Broadcasting Network.
the stock of Blake Media, the parent company of this network...
...plunged this morning on the news of Blake's death...
...but bounced back after a statement by Blake's longtime number 2, Chuck Cedar.
all the king's horses and all the king's men...
...couldn't save Preston Blake from becoming a human Popsicle.
and sources indicate that Blake, who was single and had no children, left no will.
so who inherits Blake's 49 percent stake in the company's stock...
...valued at $40 billion?
we'll discuss that with people close to Blake, including his longtime barber...
...on tomorrow's lnside Access. Until then, I'm Mac McGrath.
are we clear? -Clear!
babe? Where's Babe?
l'll come over and choke you to death. -Babe!
l got to go.
freaking barber! That's the best you could get me?
people tell everything to their barbers.
he's been his closest confidant for more than 20 years.
l'm not putting this guy on the air. Get me something better and get it quick.
or it's your ass.
did we find this heir yet?
we should be getting that information via fax any minute now.
l have lawyers looking through birth records...
...in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam.
ln fact, we have a little pool going. Guam's paying off at 1000-1.
ls this a joke to you?
some genetic lottery winner now controls the fate of this company.
no, l agree. lt's troubling.
troubling? Your beard is troubling.
your pipe is troubling. Your yellow teeth are really troubling.
but if l lose control of this company, it'll be catastrophic.
does anyone know a Dr. Mendlesohn?
congratulations, you have a spastic colon.
that would explain a lot.
Chuck, l think we're there.
my God, it's all green.
look at that thing. Fighter pilot on your left.
got that sucker!
you guys lost?
we're looking for somebody: Longfellow Deeds.
ls that Deeds' first name?
lf the Deeds you're referring to is Longfellow Deeds...
...then yes, that is Deeds' first name.
l don't know Deeds' first name. Maybe it's Greg.
maybe it's Longfellow. -Maybe.
but l don't know. l know another guy named Greg. You want me to call him?
No! Thank you. Please, just tell us where Deeds lives.
all right, don't get all hyperactive. l'll take you straight to him.
step right in, fellows.
he lives at a pizzeria? -You can't live in a pizzeria.
he lives upstairs. He owns it.
excuse me. ls Mr. Deeds around?
no, l'm sorry, he's out making deliveries. The regular delivery guy called in sick.
but you don't look too sick, Murph. -l forgot l was faking sick today.
you two tricked me into coming here. -Murph, put on an apron and give me a hand.
you guys played me like a fiddle. Touche!
ls Mrs. Deeds around?
Mrs. Deeds? l don't think that poor boy ever had a date.
do you know when he'll be back? -Before lunch is out. Today's Card Day.
card Day? -Deeds writes greeting cards.
every Monday, he tries out a few and then he chooses one...
...and sends it to one of the big card companies.
now, he hasn't sold any yet, but...
...he will.
you guys need anything else here?
"to my sweetheart " l love you completely, with all my soul " Without you l'm nothing, a butterless roll "
that's good.
like that, gentlemen?
hallmark said it showed potential, which is pretty cool.
longfellow Deeds? -Just call me Deeds, pal.
easy with that Longfellow stuff.
Cecil Anderson, General Counsel of Blake Media.
handshakes are for strangers. We hug around here, buddy.
what's up? Welcome to town.
come on, don't be shy.
l like that beard. Abe Lincoln-style. Have a seat, boys.
l thought you were sick today. -That was a lie, pal.
you fooled me.
l did? -Yeah.
Mr. Deeds? -Just Deeds.
you sounded so sick on the phone. You're good. Do that sick voice again.
deeds, l can't come to work today. l think l got strep throat.
that's unbelievable. You could be a radio actor or something.
Thanks, buddy. -Sure.
Hey, Deeds. Read a card already. l got to get back on duty.
l'd better get up there. Good meeting you, gentlemen.
Mr. Deeds, does the name Preston Blake mean anything to you?
mom's maiden name was Blake.
only one this week, but l got a feeling it'll end my losing streak with Hallmark.
Preston Blake was your mother's uncle.
you're kidding me, l got an uncle? Awesome. How's he doing?
he's dead.
Oh, no. lf there's anything l can do...
l'll be right with you guys.
when Mr. Blake died, he left an enormous fortune.
wait a minute.
what are you talking about, you got to get back on duty? You're not a cop.
you're right. l got this down at the costume shop.
but it can't hurt to pretend.
what a wisenheimer!
okay, everybody, it's showtime.
l call this " 50th Anniversary Card. "
which is quite a feat nowadays.
fifty years have passed by with laughter and tears " Do you remember when we went to the zoo " and that time we drank all the beers "
beers!
l promise to love you for 50 years more " Even when your bosoms sag down to the floor "
that was awesome! How's he do it?
lt looks like you won't have to deliver pizza anymore, Deeds.
you're a very rich man.
what's that got to do with delivering pizzas?
ladies! The top one is yours.
thank you, Deeds. -Of course.
yummy! -So, Deeds, what's new?
l found out l have an uncle, but he died.
that's too bad.
he gave me $40 billion, though. -Well, that's nice.
Oh, yeah!
don't you go and spend it all on some fancy record player.
l won't.
who are your friends, Deeds?
l'm sorry. Chuck, Cecil, this is Jane, Kitty and Sue.
pleasure to meet you, Cecil. -Pleasure's all mine, Kitty.
or should l just say, " Meow " ?
keep it in your pants, Anderson.
now, why am l inheriting this money? -You're Mr. Blake's closest living relative.
Really? He had nobody else? -Nope, that's it.
gosh, l never even met the guy.
would you hold this for a second?
Mr. Wetherley. How you doing, pal?
very well, Deeds. Just going to the pharmacy.
well, let me get you there a little quicker.
how's your wife? -She's fine.
terrific. Say hi for me. -l will.
okay. Here you go.
thanks for the lift, Deeds. -You got it.
we need you to come back to New York with us. Just for a few days.
we're drawing up some papers you'll need to sign.
what kind of papers?
technically, you've inherited 300 million shares of Blake Media, lnc.
Chuck and l, along with some of the partners, will buy that stock...
...for $40 billion, which we've had to borrow from various
who cares about the financial mumbo jumbo?
and while we're doing that, we need you to stay away from the press.
the media frenzy will die down in a couple weeks but until then...
you don't want reporters crawling all over this lovely little town, do you?
Oh, no!
crazy Eyes! -What?
how you doing, pal? l got your pizza, just the way you like it.
Oh, yes!
french fries and Oreos. You know me all too well, Deeds.
what are you in for?
l'm doing a one-nighter for biting Ed the mailman.
the guy was trying to cast a spell on me, like a wizard.
are you sure about that? -l don't know. Maybe he was just waving.
who are your friends? -This is Chuck and Cecil from New York.
l don't like them.
okay. Nice seeing you.
l've never been to New York before. l suppose l could check out the sights.
give me an hour to pack, okay? -You got it.
l'll be the first guy to leave here since Jimmy McNally went to Disney World.
see you later, everybody!
tomorrow is " Kids Eat For Free " Day. Don't forget to clean the highchairs.
don't worry, l'll take care of everything.
go, have a good time! -l'll miss you.
Bye, Jan. Smell you later, Murph.
give us a card! -Yeah!
on my way to the big city for a business trip "Never, ever left Mandrake Falls before Ain't that a pip "But while l'm gone, l know l'll miss you all a lot "
"so bring your rich butt back here and buy us all a shot "
you got it, pal!
take it easy.
the biggest story of the year and we've got nothing?
do you people want to be tabloid journalists? Because l don't think so.
you've got to be ruthless. When l started out...
...l slept in Tom and Roseanne's dumpster for two days...
...disguised as a giant carton of ice cream. -l got it!
my source at Blake says the company helicopter...
...took off from there this afternoon with two male passengers aboard...
...headed for Mandrake Falls. -Where?
some little hick-ass town in New Hampshire.
but now they're on their way back with three male passengers.
that's one more! -Duh!
that third guy's our heir. Nice work, Marty.
they were supposed to arrive at Blake Media at 5: 00.
but they made an unscheduled stop in Connecticut.
I'm so happy I got the Big Bacon Classic.
thanks for stopping. This is unbelievable.
happy to do it. -How's that Frosty treating you, Cecil?
you got some on your beard. l'm just kidding.
l got him big time, man.
l'm going on the air in two hours' time.
and l want that guy's life story by then. l'm talking to you, Jim.
and l'm also talking to you, Babe. Babe?
where the hell's Babe?
you missed another staff meeting. Mac's pissed.
he won't be pissed when l crack this Blake story.
what do you got? -Nothing. Do you have anything?
l'll have a lot more in a few hours.
you got to be a pal.
l need this story. l'm flat broke and Mac is going to fire me.
How're you flat broke? You make more money than anyone here.
what did you blow it on? -Shoes.
l'll tell you everything l know over lunch tomorrow...
...as long as your club promoter boyfriend...
...doesn't try to run me over with his motorcycle again.
you're safe there. Ken and l are kind of taking a break.
Really? So he moved out?
babe, what are you staying here for? l have a spare bedroom.
we tried that once, remember?
l woke up and you were standing over my bed, breathing heavily.
l was having an asthma attack. l couldn't find my puffer.
easy, fellows. The Biggie Fries are making a comeback.
you guys football fans? The Pats could take the conference this year.
the Dolphins are overrated and the Jets are choke artists.
l wouldn't say that, Mr. Deeds.
just Deeds. Why is that, though? -You own the Jets, Deeds.
l do?
that sucks.
l hope they don't play the Pats in the playoffs or l'll have to kill myself.
l'm still very worried about this.
what do you got in that pipe, hashish? You're paranoid.
this guy's perfect for us. -What if he won't sell us his shares?
lf l got Blake to trust me with his company...
...l can get this moron to do the same. Look at him.
that's right, Anderson.
enough!
party pooper.
holy cow!
what's up, New York?
it's an honor to come to the greatest city in the world!
congratulations, Deeds, you're now the most eligible bachelor in New York.
l don't want to meet a girl just because l'm wicked rich.
that's nice, but let's see how you stick to your guns...
...once you've paid a visit to one of our many fine gentlemen's clubs.
what?
my father saved my mother.
she was figure skating and fell through the ice.
l always thought l'd meet a girl the same way. Bullspit like that.
then l'll just keep a lookout for ladies in distress, as it were.
that'd be nice. -Hey, Mandrake Falls!
security, stop that guy!
stop! Come back!
he'll get $100, 000 for the picture. lt'll be on the news in an hour.
he deserves it with those James Bond moves he just pulled.
no, he deserves to get his throat cut, the filthy spy. Come on, let's go.
so this is where my uncle lived?
Yes, sir. For the last 5 years of his astonishing life.
you kind of snuck up on me there. -l am very, very sneaky, sir.
l see that. My name is Deeds.
l am Emilio, sir. l am your servant.
servant? l don't want a servant, but if you want to be my friend, l'll take that.
friends.
Yes, good friends.
would you like to go down to your apartment? l'm sure it's been an exhausting day.
that okay with you, Chuck? -You'll be safe there.
lt'll take us a couple days to draw up the papers for you to sign.
go make yourself at home. -Terrific.
later. -l will be with you shortly, sir.
you got it. Nice to meet you. l'm Deeds.
l'm Reuben, sir. -This is a wicked nice elevator.
keep an eye on him, Emilio. Or it's your ass.
lt's nice to see you too, sir.
so how's the elevator business treating you, Reuben?
lt has its ups and downs.
all right! All right!
that was good.
Jeesum crow, how'd you get down here so fast?
Sneaky-sneaky, sir. Right this way.
Wow.
Wow.
ls something the matter, sir?
that's an echo, sir. -Yeah, you try it.
me, sir? -lt's a lot of fun.
come on, you can do it louder than that.
serious. -Thank you, sir.
Hey, buddy, how you doing? You want to give it a shot?
nice.
you guys want to join us? Make a weird noise.
that was a great time. Well, l'm tired. l'd like to go to sleep.
this way. -Thank you very much. Good night, everyone.
good night.
you just going to lie there and let the Post take your story?
what's up, New York?
he had a water fountain in his room. l love it.
he had a water fountain in his room. l love it.
that's Hawaiian Punch.
he adored...
...Hawaiian Punch.
Wow! You kind of just snuck up on me there.
l fear you're underestimating the sneakiness, sir.
l guess l was. What are you doing down there?
l am assisting you with your sock change.
you'd change my socks for me? You don't got to do that. Stand up.
thank you.
besides, you don't want to have to touch my right foot.
l got wicked bad frostbite when l was in the Scouts. Check it out.
pretty messed up, huh?
the hideousness of that foot will haunt my dreams forever.
Yeah, l've heard that before.
but the weird thing is l got no feeling left in it.
so you could jump on it and it wouldn't hurt me.
go ahead, jump on it. -l'd really rather not, sir.
please jump on my foot.
l didn't feel that.
what else you got? Get that fireplace poker and whack my foot.
do l absolutely have to? -lt's going to be fun. Just grab it.
all my friends do this when they're wasted.
come on.
go ahead, give it a whack.
nothing. -Really?
lsn't that sick?
didn't feel that. lsn't that awesome? Go ahead.
nothing.
you're starting to like it, aren't you? Chop that wood!
that's it!
you're sick! You're sick! Why would you do that?
l'm just kidding you, pal.
you had me going there. -l saw your face, you were like...
l got to find out from Cedar and Anderson what l'm supposed to do today.
so could you take that out of my foot? l'm nailed to the ground.
there you go.
l must insist on absolute secrecy regarding this discussion...
...till l've officially acquired Mr. Blake's shares.
lf that's acceptable, then as far as l'm concerned...
...you've just bought 2, 000 radio stations.
good morning.
what's up?
doing a little business.
this room's an echo room, too. l'm sure you guys already knew that.
may l help you?
l just wanted to see if there's anything l should do today.
l think we've got everything under control.
there's got to be something. Until l sign those papers l own this place, right?
what?
ladies and gentlemen, pardon me a moment, please.
of course.
what's up, buddy? l was dreaming about Frosties all last night. You?
l tried to make my own at home, but it wasn't the same.
every stockholder, large and small, has a say in the operation of this company.
they have this say at the annual stockholders' meeting.
the other 64 days of the year, the officers of the company, like me...
...run the show. -You mean now that my uncle's gone.
Yeah, and it's not all fun and games.
this company is a player on so many levels and in so many areas...
...that running it is literally a 24-hour-a-day job.
l only got three hours of sleep last night.
then it's actually a 21-hour-a-day job, huh?
move it, lady. I don't give a damn about no meeting.
Mr. Cedar, l am sorry
l passed for , 500 yards last season and l ain't gonna touch a football...
...until you get off your fat, rich asses and renegotiate my bullshit contract.
easy with the language, buddy. There are ladies present.
shut the hell up, rich boy!
l want more money, or you all can just suck my
l warned you.
you went down like a sack of potatoes, l'll tell you that much. Come on.
come on, big man. Upsy-daisy.
mesdames and Gentlemen, football!
what's the problem with your contract?
l figured if l played well, l'd renegotiate and get more money.
lf you didn't play well, could we renegotiate and pay you less?
shit, no!
l mean, no.
doesn't seem fair to me.
he led the League in touchdown passes. -That's okay, Chuck. l got this one.
listen, fellows, l want more money...
...or l ain't even gonna play another down.
well, we'll have to let you go then.
'let me go " ? -Yeah, you're fired.
so can l sign with another team?
you can do anything. l suggest you change your attitude...
...or nobody will want to work with you.
Bye.
Kevin won the Heisman Trophy two years ago. He is our best player.
don't worry, he'll be back. -Biggest mistake of your lives!
this thing is cool.
why don't you get out and enjoy the city? Everything's fine here. Take that with you.
l'll leave it here. That's all right. But call me if you need me.
Absolutely. -Thanks. Love you, Anderson.
all you guys, l noticed you were French. The opposite of bonjour to you.
you look so hot as a blond.
lt's not too streaky? l feel like he did it really streaky.
l love it, but let me go undercover. This could get dangerous.
he said he likes ladies in distress, not men who wear too much Cologne.
there he is. -Thanks for the tour.
you're welcome. -Hidden cameras on, ready? Molest me.
molest me! -You got it!
God, help! -Give it to me.
help, l'm being mugged! -All right!
help! Help! l'm being mugged!
stop it! -Good luck. See you at the office.
don't worry, l'll get him. -Oh, shit!
stop right there.
come on!
what's your problem, pal?
come up here.
got your pocketbook. Get a job, pal.
miss! Miss!
are you okay? -What happened?
let me help you up.
all right, now. All right.
ma'am, you were just the victim of a New York City mugger.
as l suspected, he was a coward and a weakling.
and also wore more Cologne than any man should wear.
l got this back for you, though. -Thank you.
can l take you to the hospital? -No, no.
l'll be all right. l just feel a little dizzy and violated.
l'm fine.
please, let me take you to the emergency room.
l'm sure l'll be all right. l just need to...
...perhaps walk it off or...
could you? -Sure.
thank you.
thank you so much.
my name is Pam. Pam Dawson.
my name is Deeds. l'm not from here. l'm just visiting.
where do you hail from?
Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire. Just a little town nobody's ever heard of.
l'm from a little town like that.
ln lowa. -ls that right? What part?
Yes, the small town of Winchestertonfieldville, lowa.
l'm sorry.
what are you doing in New York? -l'm a school nurse.
there's no way you're a school nurse. -Why, don't you believe me?
you're too nice to be a school nurse.
my school nurse was so mean, every time l'd tell her l had a tummy ache...
...she'd send me back to my class and say, " Stop whining. "
but that's awful! -Well, l said it every day.
l missed my mother.
that's sweet.
miss Dawson?
how would you like to maybe go out...
...and have a New York City dinner with me?
golly.
that sounds wonderful.
lt does? -Yeah.
let's do it, then. -Okay.
damn you, Old Spice.
so you run this pizza place and you have your poetry.
what brings you to the big city?
actually, l just inherited $40 billion.
well, that's nice, but l think anything over $30 billion is just gravy.
l like that.
your hair is very blond and pretty.
l'm of Swedish ancestry.
Really? -Yes.
my grandfather was in ABBA.
abba, the band?
excuse me, do you get any famous people in here?
famous, rich, powerful.
Really? We don't get any famous people in Mandrake Falls.
stephen King stopped by our gas station one time...
...but everyone was too scared to talk to him.
l'd imagine he'd be very spooky.
Jake, the gas station attendant, made eye contact with him.
that night he lost 200 pounds.
Wow.
your chicken parmesan should be ready soon.
okay, buddy. l saw a couple over there. lt's their anniversary.
give them this. Don't say it's from us, though.
this is like $20, 000.
tell them it was a restaurant giveaway or something. Thanks, buddy.
that's an awfully nice way to start spending your money.
ls that who l think it is? -Who?
Preston Blake's nephew, the $40-billion man.
we have to meet him. Dave?
gosh, l hope that mugger got home okay.
Mr. Deeds. -Yeah.
Mr. Simonds would like to invite you to join his party.
why is that?
just to enjoy the pleasure of your company.
wow, that's pretty cool of him.
that was a very nice hug, Deeds.
lt's wicked nice of you to invite us over. This is awesome.
have we met? -Not unless you have a sick kid.
you're a very important man in this town now, Mr. Deeds.
l don't know about that.
l sing at the Metropolitan Opera...
...and Blake Media contributes 50 percent of our budget.
so, on behalf of the opera:
"thank you "
that was awesome!
you shouldn't thank me, though. You should thank my great-uncle.
he was an interesting man.
l served on the board of the Guggenheim with him.
Really? l'm not sure what that is, but good luck with it.
l'd love to write a piece on you for The New Yorker.
what's The New Yorker?
lt's a magazine.
with essays, witty cartoons.
l read the Mandrake Falls Gazette and they got some cartoons in there also.
you know who's a riot? That Beetle Bailey guy.
he's always wearing his hat and doing his thing.
but it is an honor to meet a real writer like you, George.
l've been trying to get my stuff published for years...
...but Hallmark is one tough cookie to crack.
hallmark? -He writes greeting cards.
l try. -You must share one with us.
l don't know about that, Mr. French. -Who's Mr. French?
doesn't he look like Mr. French? -l've never heard of him.
come on.
all right, l'll give you one.
this is a Mother's Day card l've been working on.
"mom, you are the one who brought me to planet Earth" "You are the one who suffered through my 14-hour birth" "You are the one who made lemonade for me after l'd come back from play" " love you, Mom, so have a wicked nice Mother's Day "
something like that.
an instant classic! - " Genius, genius, genius "
do you write your poems with a crayon?
lt's amazing!
l see why you brought me here. To goof on me, huh?
don't be silly, Deeds. -Pipe down, George.
l may seem funny to you, but if you came to Mandrake Falls...
...you might seem funny to us. Only nobody would laugh at you...
...and make you feel stupid, that wouldn't be good manners.
maybe my poems aren't that great, but l know some people who like them.
anyways, it's the best l can do. We're going to get going.
sorry about that, Pam. l hope l didn't embarrass you.
and if it wasn't for Miss Dawson being here, l'd knock your heads in.
l don't mind.
okay.
"no"
l think l just shat myself.
how would you like to see the sights now?
l just need to powder my nose.
that would be great. l'll get your coat.
Hey, buddy, this will pay for everything l damaged. Sorry about that.
good to meet you guys. -Thank you.
God, that was good stuff.
l want a raise, Mac.
Hey, man! What's up?
l saw what you did to those guys making fun of you. Nice work.
you know what it's like to get riled up don't you, Johnny Mac?
that l do. -l'm Deeds, by the way.
deeds, nice to meet you. You got to let me buy you a drink.
miss Dawson, this is John McEnroe.
miss Dawson, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too.
l promised Miss Dawson l'd take her sightseeing.
the sights are great. l've seen the sights. l love the sights.
let me show you a New York most people will never see.
that okay with you, Miss Dawson? -Sounds like fun!
here's to a big night on the town.
what happened?
here are some aspirins, Mr. Deeds. They make your head seem smaller.
how did l get in these pajamas? -l changed you.
l was very gentle, sir.
l think l drank all the alcohol in Manhattan last night.
and you nearly succeeded, according to Miss Dawson.
miss Dawson! l don't even remember taking her home. ls she okay?
l took the liberty of sending her off in the company limousine.
she was a lady in distress and l helped her.
dreamt about her last night.
usually, when you get blackout drunk you don't dream.
so l read.
what's up, Chuck?
america's newest billionaire...
...stupid and drunk. -What's this?
it was quite a night for Longfellow Deeds.
they'll know my name is Longfellow.
after punching out some society types...
...Deeds joined forces with the original bad boy of tennis, John McEnroe.
and stupidity won in straight sets.
how'd they get that footage?
watch out, Johnny!
what kind of driving is that? You're a fucking disgrace!
no, sir. You're a disgrace.
we did it, man! -Johnny McEnroe!
look at Deedsy hanging out with McEnroe! That's awesome!
l love the Beach Boys.
here l go, here l go.
this is not the kind of attention we need right now.
what do you mean?
for the moment you're the largest stockholder...
...and people might think any instability you show...
...may equal instability in the company.
my bad.
my bad. My bad.
okay. Okay.
my bad. -Okay.
shall l call your car, Mr. Cedar, to take you to the funeral?
what funeral?
your great-uncle's funeral.
his funeral's today? -Today, yes.
l'll go get my suit on.
cute, bigmouth. -Sir?
as soon as that moron goes back to Cowpie Falls...
...you are out of here on your fat Puerto Rican ass.
l hail from Spain, sir.
OLE.
now, Brother Preston is soaring with eagles high above.
because he lived a life of love.
Yes, he's flying way up high...
...because he was a supercool guy.
he's gone away, too soon, it seems...
...leaving behind his unfinished dreams.
this guy could make a fortune writing greeting cards.
Yes, we remember Preston Blake...
...a man with faith no man could shake.
a strength no man could break.
a character no man could fake.
for goodness sake, let's eat some cake.
Amen.
excuse me, Reverend, that was a grand slam.
that part with soaring with the eagles gave me goosebumps.
thank you, my brother. -My friend got me a mug for my birthday.
lt says, " lt's hard to soar with the eagles when you're surrounded by turkeys. "
but what you said was better.
lt's all good.
rest in peace, Preston. That concludes today's service.
l actually thought l would say something.
Deedsy was always the best speaker in school.
that's some job, by the way, Your Majesty.
l thought we were watching Scooby-Doo.
Hi, my name is Deeds. l was Preston Blake's great-nephew.
l wrote a poem for him on my way over here, in my head.
and l'm going to recite it for you.
l didn't realize l'd be following the rhyme-master Reverend Sharpton.
but here we go anyways.
"you climbed mountains and built skyscrapers" " You made TV shows and put out newspapers" " You were wicked good at doing stocks" " You liked it when Emilio would change your socks" " We never hung out and that makes me sad" " All the good times we could've had "
nice rhyme.
but when l die, Uncle Preston, you'd better say, 'Cheers!'
'cause me and you are hanging at the pearly gates " "l'll bring the beers, l'll bring the beers "
he's good.
Amen.
l know this is supposed to be a closed casket, but where l come from...
...we feel it's good to see the body for the grieving process, so...
sorry about that! l'll keep this sucker closed.
he's still pretty frozen.
almost there.
l'll keep an eye on the company for you. Love you.
nice meeting you. Thanks for the apartment.
that was freaky.
everybody drive home safe.
man, this guy is in way over his head.
take care. -You'll see him tonight?
Yes, l'm calling around 4: 00. That's when l get off work.
remember, l'm Pam Dawson, virgin school nurse from Winchestertonfieldville, lowa.
that's priceless.
you, a virgin.
all right, thank you. -Excuse me, sir.
l told him he could have that. -Thanks.
right on. Nice seeing you.
you need to use our bathroom, come back and use it, okay?
will do! -All right.
how do you think l did at the funeral today?
you spoke beautifully, sir.
l still feel bad.
l snapped my uncle's hand off when l put him back in the casket.
lucky for him, he was dead, sir.
even though his face was frozen that way...
...it looked to me like he was a happy guy. Am l right?
he truly was. -Come on, sit down, please.
and l got to hang out with him, just like this...
...almost every day for 30 years.
what did you guys talk about?
we spoke of life, love, art, wine, business.
l learned much from him.
l bet you miss him, too. -l do.
he was like a parent to me.
you see, l never knew my father, and Mama...
...she passed while giving the birth to me.
you want some Cocoa Pebbles? -No, thanks.
l have much work to do.
Thanks. You don't have to do that. -Enjoy your Pebbles.
one more thing.
your great-uncle did not let me change his socks for him, either.
l like feet.
l do not know why.
hello.
Hi, Deeds? lt's Pam. Pam Dawson.
l'm so happy you called. l'm wicked sorry about last night.
l don't drink very often.
l thought you held your liquor very well.
unfortunately, l couldn't hold it for too long.
that's okay. l didn't really like that skirt anyway.
l'm getting a call on the other line. Can you hang on for a second?
sure. -Thank you.
hello.
Mr. Deeds, this is Kevin Ward, the quarterback you punched.
what's up, buddy?
l wanted to say that l was thinking it over and l'd like to live up to my word.
and l'd like to win you a Super Bowl.
that's terrific, pal. -And my daddy wants to speak to you.
deeds. Buddy Ward here, Kevin's daddy.
how you doing, Mr. Ward?
l just want to thank you for teaching my boy a lesson.
he's a good kid. He just has to watch his language in front of ladies.
l'll remind Kevin where he comes from.
that sounds terrific.
you used foul language in front of a lady?
no, Daddy, no!
still here.
how's it going? You at work?
Yep, here in the nurse's office. -Any customers?
customers? Oh, sick kids.
well, little Billy Barty's here.
you're not feeling too good, Billy? -Miss Dawson, my tummy hurts.
why don't you just lay back and relax?
that was nice. Good job.
l've got too much doo-doo in my underpants.
make the stinky go away.
well, you sound like you got your hands full, so...
...l'll just come out with it.
how would you like to do something with me tonight?
l'd love to do something with you.
great.
we can't go out drinking. I got our company in trouble.
that's okay. l was brought up never to drink alcohol.
not even rum raisin ice cream.
I like that. I'll think of something good.
see you tonight.
okay. 'Bye.
l got to try this.
was that awesome?
am l out or safe?
l'm with you.
what is this? My great-uncle's personal journal.
should l read it? -Family.
family, safe, good.
all right, have a good night. My back hurts!
nice doing business with you. -Thank you.
thanks for the bikes.
what are you gonna do with your $20, 000?
buy a giraffe. What are you gonna do with your $20, 000?
quit school.
good idea, school is for fools. Look at me!
the park is beautiful.
these trees, they remind you of Winchestertonfieldville at all?
Oh, yes. Very much so.
what was it like growing up there?
lt was great.
l remember walking down to the corner drugstore...
...and getting malted milkshakes.
what was your house like?
we had this big Victorian.
right off Main Street.
blue shutters and a big red door. -All right.
and a tire swing in the front yard. -l love it.
and l remember the time l fell out of old Boo Radley's apple tree...
...and broke my arm.
...he came and he scooped me up and he ran me all the way to Dr. Pepper's.
Dr. Pepper.
Yeah.
l'm glad that guy was around.
want to sit down? -Sure.
thank you. -My pleasure.
l was reading my great-uncle's journal on my way over to you.
and, when he was age 9...
...he wrote that he had the only family on the block with a radio...
...and he was dreaming of becoming a disc jockey someday.
a disc jockey?
you know, when l was a kid, l wanted to be a news reporter.
l used to go around interviewing everyone...
...and writing notes in my little Holly Hobby notebook.
people didn't like that. l got beat up a lot.
do you remember their names? -No, it was a long time ago.
but my grandma said to me:
"one day you'll grow up and work for 60 Minutes..."
..."and make a difference in the world. "
you do make a difference in the world, every day. You're a school nurse.
anyways, this is what happened to my uncle.
later on in his life, he'd go to this radio station that he owned...
...at 3: 00 in the morning and DJ for an hour.
that's great.
so, don't give up hope. You'll be a reporter someday.
lf you really want to.
that would be nice.
Jeesum Crow, a fire! -A fire?
we should help. -We should?
let's get going. -To the fire?
Fifi, get over here right now. -Come on, we'll catch you.
go away! l can't leave without my kitties. They're all l got.
crazy lady!
Oh, babies, where are you? -Up there now, get going!
longfellow Deeds, Mandrake Falls volunteer fire chief. l'll be up there in a jiff.
he's crazy. -He's going up there right now, though.
look at him. -Where's he going?
watch it, man!
Sully, who's that guy up there? -l don't know.
he says he's from the Mandrake Falls Fire Department.
how's he climb like that? -He must have monkey blood in him.
lt's an honor to work with New York's bravest guys.
be careful!
l'll get you. -Babies, where are you?
ma'am! -Lord, it's hot in here.
kitties, come to Mommy. -Calm down. Everything will be all right.
okay, but l'm not leaving without my kitties.
how many do you got? -Seven.
holy shit! Let's get cracking.
l apologize for the language. -Apology accepted.
fire excites me. -Knock yourself out.
come here. -That's Freddy.
here we go! -Oh, my children!
nice catch, Pam! -Good throw, Deeds!
that's Frobo. Thank you, darling. -Coming at you, boys.
l'll take that.
there's a lot more. -Okay, okay.
holy shit, it's a cat!
full snap. l got you, kitty.
nice grab!
one more to go.
Fifi, where are you?
l think l found Fifi. -Oh, good!
hang in there, buddy!
l got it!
okay, let's do this together.
be careful!
all right, they do it all the time. Here we go.
Oh, shit!
l'm okay.
are you okay?
Yes, l am. Thanks to you!
you're hurting me!
longfellow Deeds is at it again.
his latest victim, Coretta Keeling...
...whose only crime was loving her cats too much.
and letting Deeds find out about it.
I'll get you! -Go away!
l love it. -Here comes two!
cat killer! -After he finished with her cats...
...he turned his sights on Miss Keeling herself.
my God!
that's not what l shot.
has Longfellow Deeds been locked up? Of course not.
while the rest of us obey the law, rich playboys like himself get to laugh at it.
longfellow Deeds. Our jackass of the week.
what the hell? Who edited that?
l did. Your first cut was great, but l needed to spice it up a bit.
the truth was a great story.
he saved that woman and her seven cats.
he was heroic! -Heroic is nice.
depraved and insane is better. -Hell, yeah!
this footage you're getting, gorgeous. Keep it coming!
God, how can we do this to such a sweet guy?
sweet? Sweet?
look at me!
was he sweet when he gave me the most savage beating of my life?
you were mugging me! -Babe!
no one is as good as this guy's pretending to be.
don't be a sucker.
he doesn't deserve this.
he doesn't deserve you.
my neck!
I feel like an idiot. They made me look like a fool, Jan.
I was thinking of going down to that lnside Access place...
...and giving Mac McGrath the beating of a lifetime.
that sounds like fun, but don't stoop to their level.
you're better than that, Deedsy.
so hang in there. And know that we are always here for you.
Thanks, Jan. My uncle really built an amazing company.
because of him, 50, 000 people have jobs.
and he always tried to do the right thing.
well, he does sound amazing.
but don't forget, he was related to you.
enough about that. Tell me more about this girl.
she's nice, a small-town kid, like me.
you got to tap that before she starts boning other guys, kid.
boo-yah!
he thinks it's you! He thinks it's you!
let's go, Cedar. Put some steam on it, kid. -Here it comes.
he's trying to kill me. You're good at this.
when you asked me to play, l thought you'd done this before.
no, Johnny McEnroe said it was wicked easy.
Plus, it was my uncle's favorite game, right?
how'd you know that? -l read it in his diary.
Really?
l didn't know he kept a diary.
sorry about that, dude.
lt's okay. He's a new member.
ball boy.
ball boy!
all right, baby, l'm ready for you.
you okay?
not a problem. -Anderson, you liked that, didn't you?
l did.
listen, Deeds, l got some good news.
those papers will be ready to sign tomorrow.
so you can relax knowing your uncle's company'll be in good hands...
...and you can go home $40 billion richer.
l was thinking about maybe sticking around here...
...and going to some meetings with you. -What?
fault!
l figured l could learn, like this tennis thing.
l swear to God, l'm not trying to do that.
l don't got to sell my shares right away, do l?
Plus, l met this girl, Cedar. l swear to God, l think she's the one.
that's wonderful for you.
that got you right in the throat, huh?
got to ask you, though, if it hits you, is it my point or yours?
yours. -l'm winning then, l guess.
"deeds info, meet in shower"?
sweet Jesus!
who are you? And what do you want to tell me?
l'm a junior producer at Inside Access.
l have information that will help you get Deeds out of town. lnterested?
very. Provided the information is good and you stop soaping your ass.
you know Deeds' girlfriend? -The school nurse.
not quite.
Lucy, bring me the overnights. J. D. will tell you where they are.
Hey. What the hell are you doing in my chair?
l think you and l could help each other out.
you excited about this trip? -l'm so excited.
where are you taking me? -l told you, that's a surprise.
well?
you got to be shitting me.
l never heard you curse before.
l'm that excited!
all you Winchestertonfield Villians, recognize this little girl?
l'll give you a hint. " l fell out of Boo Radley's apple tree..."
..."and my arm is killing me! "
come on, it's little Pammy Dawson!
hello.
you related to Bill Dawson?
Yes, he's my relative.
l think l remember you.
did you used to have a hump on your back?
Yes, that was me. l had a slight hump. -Really?
this was no slight hump.
the girl l'm thinking of looked like she had a damn beach ball on her back.
okay, it was a huge hump and l'm a little sensitive about it.
look, Martha, it's Quasimodo, all growed up.
how wonderful! l thought you died.
she actually became a school nurse.
you're a nurse? -Yes.
what should l do about this?
l would call Dr. Pepper. -Who?
lt was so great seeing everybody again. We're going to leave now.
Bye.
Hi, mailman. -'Morning.
how you doing?
Oh, my God, there it is.
blue shutters, red door, tire swing. That's your house, isn't it?
wouldn't you know it?
come on.
how you guys doing? You know who she is?
she used to live in this house when she was a little girl.
lt's true.
you live here and she used to live here. You're practically cousins.
so many memories.
where to begin?
this is our fireplace...
and this was my brother's room.
my parents hated my brother.
my daddy built this house with his bare hands six years ago.
your daddy is a liar.
how come you
he's choking. We should go.
help. -What are you talking about?
you're the nurse, help him. -Save him!
stand back, kids. -He's gonna die!
take him to the hospital! -Smack it out!
save him! -Get it out of him!
save him, please!
that was amazing. -Thank you.
l saved his life.
you're my hero, Nurse Dawson.
thank you, thank you.
good parking job, buddy. -Thanks, Deeds.
l had such a wonderful time.
thank you for such a great day.
thanks for showing me your town. -l hope sometime to see your hometown.
maybe someday this will be my new hometown.
there's something l have to tell you. -What's the matter?
what?
go back to New Hampshire and enjoy being rich.
sucker.
l made a card for you.
lt's kind of dumb.
l never worked on anything harder, though, so don't laugh at me.
remember we went to the restaurant that first night...
...and you ordered chicken parmesan?
so l drew you a plate.
there's the chicken and the cheese...
...and the linguini. That took me a long time with the squigglies.
lt's beautiful.
there's a poem inside for you.
"hard to breathe, feels like floating" "So full of love my heart's exploding" "Mouth is dry, hands are shaking" "My heart is yours for the taking" "Acting weird, not myself" "Dancing around like the Keebler elf"
that was funny.
finally time for this poor schlub " to know how it feels to fall in lub "
l couldn't think of anything else that rhymes with " schlub. "
"rub " and " tub " didn't work.
l'm sorry, Deeds.
l'm really sorry. -Don't be sorry, that was unbelievable.
Hi, Mrs. Finch... Atticus.
sleep well.
al, l'm gonna walk home. -Okay, Deeds.
l love New York!
nobody cares!
l'm in love with him.
l'm going to see him tonight and tell him everything.
he'll probably punch you in the face. -l kind of hope he does.
come on, Babe, snap out of it.
you really want to throw all this away for a dipshit like that?
he's not a dipshit. He's a goodhearted guy who we think is a weirdo...
...because he doesn't share our sense of ironic detachment.
all this hip, snide, smart-alecky-- -Bullshit?
Yes, bullshit.
well, in a few moments, l'll put on my Versace overcoat...
...get into my Mercedes, drive to my Fifth Avenue apartment...
...and squeeze my girlfriend's big, fake boobs.
and that bullshit you're talking about paid for all of it.
good for you, Mac. But l'm still telling him.
well...
babe Bennett falls in love.
l'm happy for you. l am.
gonna miss you, Babe.
something fierce.
you think she'll like this?
all right.
chicken parmesan? Terrific, thank you.
let's hear it.
she gonna like that, Mr. Deeds. -Okay.
Emilio, it looks beautiful. -Thank you.
these roses might be a little too high. l won't be able to see her.
do we have anything smaller? -Yes, sir.
okay.
that's terrific.
would you mind sitting for a second? -Yes, sir.
say something to me. Pretend you're her.
me, sir? -Please.
well...
...It's nice of you to have invited me to dine with you this evening.
lt's my pleasure.
actually, you're too tall. Can you slink down?
like this? -That's good.
this is one of the best dates l've ever been on.
you make me feel very special.
you make me feel very special, too.
that's why l got this for you.
okay, lean forward.
l really like you a lot. -l like you, too.
l can't stop thinking about you. -l can't stop thinking about you.
please let me touch your feet.
okay, this is getting weird. You can stand up now.
deeds! -Fellows!
we wanted to come and wish you the best on your big night.
thanks a lot. l'm so nervous. l never asked anybody to marry me before.
lt's 7: 0, time for Inside Access.
we're not in for any more nasty surprises, are we?
l don't think so. l haven't done anything stupid all day. l've been here.
let's see what lame show they put on when they don't have Deeds to pick on.
excuse me!
could you put on Channel 8, please? -You got it.
welcome to lnside Access. I'm Mac McGrath.
okay, pal.
...while maintaining an appropriate journalistic distance.
but what happens when a reporter becomes part of what she's reporting?
what happens when a journalist falls in love with an idiot?
that's Longfellow Deeds with Pam Dawson.
l can't believe they involved her in this. -A school nurse...
...who recently moved to New York City from Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa.
but wait. Doesn't Pam Dawson bear a striking resemblance to Babe Bennett, a producer here at lnside Access?
in fact, the two are one and the same.
we'll wire your apartment with state-of-the-art surveillance video.
sounds good.
l came here to try to explain.
l'm the biggest sucker in the world.
this town can be brutal.
l don't belong here.
l can't run the company, l can't even run my own life.
sure you can. The good news is the papers are ready.
once you sign them, we'll get our stock and you'll get your $40 billion.
l don't want that money. Just give it to a charity.
what's a good charity? -The United Negro College Fund?
okay, give it to those guys.
can we give you a ride to the airport? The company chopper will take you home.
Thanks, anyway. l'll be all right on my own.
nice meeting you all. -Nice meeting you, Deeds.
goodbye!
goodbye.
lt's not right.
lt's not right.
you must be Jan. My name is
l know who you are. Wham-bam Dawson.
A. k. a. Little Miss Slut-Slut.
okay, l deserve that.
do you have any idea how much you hurt him?
you're not getting anywhere near that boy.
l have to find him and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
there's a lot l can do to stop you. -He needs to know how bad l feel.
and that l would go to the end of the earth...
...l would do anything to take back what l did to him.
l'm sorry, all l heard was, " Blah, blah, l'm a dirty tramp. "
tell you what. You get by me...
...l'll tell you where he is.
feeling crazy!
come to Mama.
l was a rodeo clown for six years. You'll have to step it up a notch, shorty.
you mean like this?
where were you kicking? l ain't got no balls, dummy!
get up!
put me down! -You got it!
l want to cut you into eight slices of bitch-eroni.
are you all right?
good kick, honey. Good kick.
all right. -Here you go.
peanut butter and gumballs. Nice combo.
don't worry about what happened. Time heals all things.
except these crazy eyes.
lt's good to be home. l know that much.
l wasn't talking to you, Deeds. l was talking to that squirrel over there.
although it's a shame about that Cedar fellow...
...tearing apart your uncle's company and firing all those nice people.
Where'd you hear that?
l watch the stock market channel all the time.
l just watch because l suspect that anchorman of being an evil leprechaun.
he can bullshit everybody else, but he ain't fooling me.
there it is.
someone!
help!
deeds! Help!
deeds! Help!
Oh, God! Deeds!
Oh, my God!
where do you got the camera hidden, in the woods?
no camera.
l'm so cold. Please!
you gonna get mugged in there, too?
l'm so...
...sorry.
l really love you.
bullshit!
l'm coming!
go down! Go down!
here comes the black foot.
No!
l know it's gross, but grab it.
l got you. l got you.
Oh, God, your foot is disgusting! -l know, l know. Come here.
come on, you okay? You okay?
l think so.
you didn't really fall out of an apple tree, did you?
no.
but l really love you.
l don't even know who you are.
l'm sorry.
l am so sorry.
a company in tatters. Preston Blake's great legacy gone to the highest bidder.
the shocking announcement from Chuck Cedar today confirmed that Blake Media...
...will be stripped down and sold off piece by piece.
the only man who could stand up to Mr. Cedar and save the company...
...Longfellow Deeds, has apparently given up his voting rights and left the city.
the sale's expected to pass with unanimous consent...
sources indicate that virtually all of Blake's 50, 000 employees...
...are likely to lose their jobs.
wait a minute. I'm a Blake employee.
holy shit! This sucks.
ladies and gentlemen, the bottom line is that this divestiture...
...will result in every shareholder, all of you and myself included...
...getting a substantial premium for our shares.
but before we vote, the company bylaws require me to open the floor...
...to shareholders for statements either for or against this buyout plan.
does anyone wish to make a statement?
dismantling this company would be an insult to a great man.
you scared me.
it is an unspeakable outrage and it cannot be allowed to happen.
excuse me. l got a statement.
unfortunately, since you sold me your 300 million shares...
...you've no right to speak at this meeting. -Unfortunately for you...
...l bought one share of Blake Media this morning.
you told me every stockholder has a say in this company.
even the little guy.
you have two minutes, but remember, I control 49 percent of this company.
you're gonna have to persuade just about everyone else...
...to start hating money.
Hello, everybody. I'm Deeds.
for a little while, I was a big part of this company.
I was wicked rich and powerful.
now being rich and powerful isn't a bad thing.
it looks like the Monopoly guy over there is pretty darned psyched about it.
but the problem is what can happen when you decide...
...that you would do absolutely anything to become rich and powerful.
l don't know who licked the red off your lollipop today...
...but you are preaching to the wrong choir.
all I'm saying is, when you were kids...
...did you dream about becoming a savvy investor one day...
...who would think with his wallet instead of his heart?
come on, I know I didn't.
I wanted to be a fireman.
I wanted to be the guy everybody called on if they were in trouble.
I wanted to help people...
...and yeah, I wanted to slide down those wicked awesome poles.
but money, that was the last thing I thought about.
what about you, sir? Did you want to be a fireman?
no, l did not.
truth be told, l wanted to be a veterinarian.
cool. Why would you want to do that?
l wanted to help sick animals. -And what do you do now?
l own a chain of slaughterhouses.
you kind of went the other way on that one, didn't you?
okay.
in the back. Come on. Tell me what you wanted to be.
l wanted to be a magician.
and what do you do now? -l operate a pornographic website.
that makes people happy also, I guess. But kind of in a grosser way.
who else? -l wanted to be a senator.
l wanted to be a florist. -lnternational House Pancake.
l wanted to be a man.
that explains a lot.
l wanted to be a Ping-Pong champion.
but you're not those things you wanted to be, are you?
everybody made a compromise, then another compromise, and now...
...you're about to put 50, 000 people out of work, to make a quick buck? Come on.
I bet if we ran into the 6th-grade versions of ourselves right now...
...they would kick our asses and put Bubble Yum in our hair...
...for even thinking about doing this.
he's right. l would've beat my greedy ass red.
l would've thrown myself off the merry-go-round.
l would've tied myself naked to a chair and burned myself with lit cigarettes.
did anyone here dream of becoming a psychiatrist?
just kidding, pal.
there's still hope for the kids inside of all of us.
please don't break up my uncle's company.
I always wanted to do that.
well...
...that was very touching, Deeds.
it appears this divestiture has been defeated.
unless I'm forgetting something.
my 300 million votes...
...plus the five million votes I control as proxy for the foreign investors.
so which way should I vote my 51 percent?
I vote aye.
305 million times.
the ayes have it. And Blake Media is no more.
not so fast, Chuck.
too bad for you, when l was a kid, l wanted to be a good reporter.
miss Bennett, I wasn't aware you were a stockholder.
there's a couple things you're not aware of.
how to tweeze your eyebrows, for instance.
also, when Deeds gave away his fortune, he gave away something that wasn't his.
what are you talking about? -l have here the diary of Preston Blake.
l stole it and read it.
please don't be mad at me. l did it for good reasons, l promise.
I would like to read a passage from Mr. Blake's diary...
...dated April 12, 1957.
I am a volcano of lust.'
I've gotten this far in business by following my heart.'
and I must follow it now...'
...in love.'
if she just gives me a sign, an opening.'
want me to wipe the leaves on your ficus tree, Mr. Blake?
you can call me Preston.
want me to wipe the leaves on your ficus tree, Preston?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
who was this mystery woman?
I have here the Blake Media ledger sign-in book from April, 1957.
on the night of the 12th, there was only one woman working on Blake's floor.
sadly, nine months later, she died, giving birth to a son.
that is my birthday.
to Miss Consuela Lopez.
that is my mother.
and the rightful heir to $40 billion!
that is my money?
a simple DNA test will show...
...that Emilio Lopez is the majority stockholder to Blake Media.
lt is my money! -That's your money!
that is my money!
way to go, Emilio!
l will do good things for everyone.
free flamenco lessons for all.
people, people! Please!
that is my money. -Don't be misled. These are all lies.
Mr. Cedar...
...you are fired.
you can't fire me!
l'm in control!
get your hands off me! l'm Chuck Cedar!
at the lake, when you saved my life...
...which l never got a chance to properly thank you for
you're welcome. -You said you didn't know who l was.
and it made me realize l don't know who l am.
so l started working on it and here's what l got so far.
my name is Babe Bennett. l grew up in Syossett, Long lsland.
l have brown eyes and l don't know what my natural hair color is anymore.
when l was in 5th grade, l got a crush on Walter Cronkite.
and l really did have that Holly Hobby notebook l was telling you about.
l love Bruce Springsteen, Almond Roca and Abbott and Costello movies.
l don't like licorice or my ankles.
more importantly, l know that l messed up real bad.
and l'd be willing to spend the rest of my life...
...begging you to give me another chance...
...because l am so deeply in love with you...
...and l know it's definitely that forever kind of love
you're crazy.
you have beautiful ankles.
let's go home.
you're fired! You! You!
Oh, you, sir. You are definitely fired.
l'd like to stay. l think l can really do some good if l just got another chance.
not fired. But tomorrow morning, you let me change your socks.
okay.
and you, Long-Long-Longfellow...
and Miss Bennett, with her beautiful research.
how can I thank you?
all l want is your friendship, Emilio. You're a good man.
l'll miss you.
how about $1 billion? -All right.
done.
holy Jeez!
l can't believe it!
what's that? -A letter from Hallmark.
they're actually going to buy one of my cards.
my gosh! Which one? -The one l wrote for you, remember it?
do l remember?
"hard to breathe, feels like floating" "So full of love my heart's exploding" "Mouth is dry, hands are shaking" "My heart is yours for the taking" "Acting weird, not myself" "Dancing around like the Keebler elf" "Finally time for this poor schlub" "to know how it feels to fall in lub"
l'm so proud of you!
can you believe Deeds bought us all these?
damn, these things are fast!
l'm okay!
l'm okay!
the CASTLE
wait!
Hey! Is anybody there?
show your permission!
permission?
of course. This village belongs to the castle and he who stays here for night practically stays in the castle and that's not allowed without presmission.
if those are the rules, I'll have to obtain permission.
from whom?
from the count. What else have I to do?
at midnight from the count?
what? Isn't that possible?
why did you wake me up then? I demand respect before count's civil servants!
I woke you up to inform you that you must leave estates of the count at once.
and who would you be? Me?
I'm Schwarzer. Son of castellan of the castle.
son of the castellan himself?
well then, mister Schwarzer,
I'm land surveyor summoned by the count to perform respective tasks.
my asistents with instruments will arrive tomorrow.
my explanations are over with that.
are you satisfied, gentlemen?
I'll settle this through phone.
Hallo! Registry?
registry?
please, take my room. I'm the innkeeper and my room's the best.
bring me better some sheets.
schwarzer is reporting. I have found a man here.
Yes. Quite showy dressed.
he says he's the land surveyor summoned by the count himself.
Yes.
Yes.
what did I say! [He] lied!
he's no land surveyor at all! Block the doors!
schwarzer speaking.
that means mistake?
mister Klamm himself?
what am I to tell mister land surveyor?
it's very unpleasant for me, mister land surveyor...
I'm asking you to forget this incident. Should you need something...
I have something better.
hand me that case.
according to our rules special permission from the castle is required to play new music.
get on the phone then. I'm sorry, but that must be written permission.
should we bother the count because of such matters?
we must write a request to mister Erlanger. I'll deliver it myself.
now - to sleep.
I'm not acquainted with the count yet.
it is told he pays good money for work well done.
mister shouldn't worry about that.
my assistants will arrive tomorrow.
could you put them up here? Sure. But aren't they going to live with you in the castle?
if we're going to work down here, it's handier to live here.
who's that? The count?
no, that's the castellan.
handsome.
it's a pity he has fool for a son.
that's how to tell...
schwarzer exaggerated a little yesterday.
his father is just assistant of the castellan and moreover one of the smallest.
what are you saying?
must I wait long still?
Hello, mister schoolteacher.
land surveyor
are you going to the castle?
Yes, already since yesterday.
you don't like it here.
what?
tell me, is it your folder?
no.
be more careful otherwise nothing will work out for you.
Hey!
who opened the door? That's the land surveyor.
what does he want?
you see...I was going to the castle and got a bit tired. I decided to come in and warm myself...to rest...
hello.
sit there!
land surveyor!
I am Gerstacker, a friend of Mr. Brunsvick - a master of this house.
you can't stay here any longer.
excuse us for inhospitability.
I didn't intend to stay.
where, exactly, is the master himself, mister Brunsvick?
that's me.
is that so?
I'm grateful to you for hospitability.
who are you?
excuse us for inhospitability. Sure, sure!
hospitability is not a custom around here, we don't need any guests.
I understand. Why should you need guests?
Hello, guys! Where are you going so late? To the ???
what for so suddenly? Business.
guys, wait up, I'm coming with you!
take me with you, I've forgotten the way!
I'll drive you there.
who were you? Gestekker?
who is that woman?
is she from the castle?
who's that?
who was that?
who are you?
your assistants.
assistants. Here's Arthur, here's Jeremiah.
Oh, so...
it was you whom I ordered to come after me? Yes.
where are the tools?
we don't have them.
do you know how to perform land surveying? No.
get out of here!
so...
here you go.
don't talk to anybody without my permission.
I am a stranger here and, as you are my old assistants, you are strangers here.
but strangers must hold together.
well?
let's shake hands?
put away your paws!
this working day is wasted, so tomorrow we're start early.
get the leigh, we'll go to the castle.
that's impossible. It's not allowed to go to castle without special call.
then make a phone call!
registry?
Registry!
can the land surveyor and two his assistants go to castle tomorrow morning?
not tomorrow or any other day.
there's a messenger to see you. Get out!
registry is listening. Who's speaking?
assistant of land surveyor is speaking.
what assistant?
Joseph.
assistants are named Arthur and Jeremiah.
those are new assistants but I'm the old one.
I came right after mister land surveyor.
what do you want, Joseph?
when can my master go to the castle?
never.
alright.
who are you?
barnabas, the messenger.
honourable mister land surveyor, as you know, you have been accepted in castle's service
your direct chief is village's elder who will explain to you all the details about your duty.
provider of this letter, Barnabas...
will be taking care of your needs and inform me...
...readiness from my side to meet you... Head of count's registry...
whose signature is this?
Klamm's.
beer for the messenger!
deliver to mister Klamm my gratitude about his exceptional kindness.
tell him that I'm ready to unresevedly obey any order of his and I have no special needs.
allow me to repeat.
sure.
so, deliver to mister Klamm gratitude about his exceptional kindness, I'm ready to obey unreservedly any order of his,
I have no special needs.
what was that?
what was that! Old local custom, mister land surveyor.
your room is already done.
my room?
prepare paper and quill, we'll discuss working plans now.
Barnabas?
Barnabas!
mister land surveyor!
and these are my sisters. Olga.
Amalia.
and this is mister land surveyor.
land surveyor!
Barnabas!
you wanted to go to the castle right from the inn. No, I was to go home right away.
I go to castle only in mornings.
take a seat by the table, everything will be ready in a moment. Meanwhile I'll go for beer.
well, then you'll escort me. I have important work left there. No, I'm going to the Gentlemen's Inn, that's nearby.
nice, I'll escort you.
well, if gentlement wants it...but you won't be admitted there.
that's nothing, I'll wait by the door.
land surveyor is alloved only in the canteen. Yes, yes, we know. Let's go.
you, as I gather, are owner of this inn?
you gather correctly.
I'd like to stay here for a night. Unfortunately, that's impossible. Inn is only for gentlemen from the castle.
I'd like to draw your attention to [the fact] that I have notable connections in the castle and they will become more notable soon, so that...
I'd be glad to come forward to you but gentlemen from the castle are very finicky and incidental encounter with an unfamiliar man can turn out to be very unbearable to them.
are there many gentlemen tonight?
from this point it's a fortunate night - there's just one Klamm.
Klamm?
Frieda! Fill the beer for us!
let's go!
do you know Klamm?
do you want to see mister Klamm?
what? There's a spyhole, you can have a look.
frieda, do you know Klamm well?
Yes, very well.
I am mister Klamm's mistress.
mistress?
then you are important person for me. Not just for you.
before this I was a cattle-tender.
with such delicate hands?
then nobody paid attention to them.
Frieda...
you amaze me, and what willpower must one have to become barmaid from simple cattle-tender.
of course, you won't be openhearted to a man whom you don't know at all, who doesn't even have an opportunity to tell about himself...
I know everything about you, you're land surveyor.
dirty swines! Who?
Klamm's henchmen. I've told him many times to leave them at the castle.
doesn't he hear? He's sleeping.
but when I looked... He was already sleeping.
misters overall sleep much.
quiet! Shut up at once!
get out from here!
get out!
get out!
haven't you seen land surveyor?
Frieda!
do you need something? I'm looking for land surveyor.
he's not there.
he is nowhere to be found. Probably he's long since gone.
I was standing by the door and didn't see him.
what if he's hiding? Yes, one can expect anything from him.
perhaps, under the coutner?
he's not there. One way or the other, you're responsible for the canteen, Frieda.
and you know what consequences breaking the rules brings.
land surveyor...
Frieda...
Frieda!
there!
Hey! I'm with land surveyor here!
I'm with land surveyor!
get out of here!
out! We were worried about you master! We brough you your coat.
get out, I said!
why have you gathered there?
you broke the rules.
I don't give a damn about your rules.
leave the inn!
I'll just get my things.
they are already gathered.
well, let's go?
I right away assumed you to be reliable man. Give my greetings to castellan.
your room has been prepared long ago.
whisk assistants away!
we can stay here.
we'll be right besides the door.
I'm waiting since long.
I think I didn't call for you.
Frieda is my foster-daughter and his fate is not uninteresting to me, because of you she has lost good job at canteen and high social state of Klamm's mistress.
and now I don't understad...I'd like to know your plans concerning my daughter's fate.
plans? They're simple.
I'm ready to marry her right after I've talked to Klamm.
to whom?
to whom?
prepare sleigh, we're going to the elder.
who are you to even concede Klamm will talk with you? You're zero, you're nobody.
I am land surveyor.
Yeah, and relocate my assistants, I've fed up with them.
land surveyor?
be thankful I've let you in my place, you wouldn't even find a place in doghouse for you elswehere in the village.
probably. Thou, I have a place where I'll be allowed not only to spend a night.
where?
at Barnabas's.
at Barnabas's? At those disgraced paupers and dirty wantons?
you've involved yourself with those dirty bitches and you want to communicate with decent people?
that's very good you've come right to me. But I must aggrieve you.
we have no need for land surveyor.
that is how?
we don't have even the smallest job for land surveyor.
guys!
where did I tell you to wait? It's cold there, master.
let them warm themselves. Those are my assistants.
so, there's been a misunderstanding.
many years ago there was a question from the castle whether we need a land surveyor.
guys, theres a folder with green inscription "Land Surveyor." Have a look.
of course, I told "No" and everything would be solved in couple of days if not for that Brunsvick.
Brunsvick?
exactly. He began to meddle in my correspondence with the castle.
he bombarded them with various letters asking for hiring a land surveyor.
that way this matter lasted several years.
he wouldn't have accomplished anything if not for his wife who serves at the castle.
is she kind of beautiful woman with sickly looks?
well, probably.
that's his wife? No, Mitze, that's minor key.
guys, have you found it? No!
but you gave it to schoolmaster?
right. I gave it to schoolmaster.
guys, put everything back.
so, in the end I won.
anyway, when smart decision not to summon land surveyor was made due to Brunsvick's cookups...
you showed up. Yes, big trouble.
don't even mention it. Well, if it's turned out this way in my person you will find...
well, I wouldn't say "a friend" but good aid in your business.
the only thing I will not allow is hiring you as land surveyor.
I'm very sorry...
but I am hired already.
interesting...
interesting.
school caretaker
there's Klamm's signature, indeed.
what are you saying!
Yes. But that's not official document.
that's personal letter what results from address "honourable mister."
moreover, there's no word about you being hired as land surveyor.
it talks about being in count's sevice in general.
so that...so that it is anything but clear here.
except me being simply thrown out!
you don't say so! Your case is too complicated, you are just promised hopsitable welcome.
nobody is throwing you out, but, at the same time, nobody is holding you [here].
Mitze! That's wrong! F sharp!
that's enough!
I will tell you what's holding me. That's the sacrifice I made leaving home, hopes I had regarding this place, finally it's the bride before whom I have responsibility!
why are you so upset? I will infrom the castle about everything, and perhaps we will think of something for you.
I will not accept alms from the castle. I want to receive what's rightfully mine.
allow me to leave on this note! Sure.
I have important meeting.
I need to put on my best robes.
have it cleaned well.
I have come to you with an errand.
Oh, mister schoolmaster. You are still here?
I'm very sorry, I have important meeting tonight. That's nothing.
it's just that mister elder has very warm soul and he is worried that you while waiting for the answer wouldn't do rash things due to your anxiety and he offers you to take place as school caretaker.
so, he's asks a favour from me? No, on the contrary, he's doing favour to you because we need school caretaker as much as we need land surveyor.
tell mister elder that I am not accepting this post.
so you're rejecting it without any discussions?
Frieda!
nice.
Frieda!
Where's my shirt!
darling, listen to me. What does it take from you to accept such nice proposition?
that's nothing terrible and we will have abode and work.
I am land surveyor not school caretaker.
and I don't want to grovel before some schoolman who only dreams about becoming my master.
things are not being made to last, master.
Mrs. Brunsvick?
I wanted to tell you I am willing to accept this...post.
do you know where I'm going?
I will be waiting for you at school.
just promise me you won't be going to these wantons.
to whom?
to those dirty barnabas's wenches.
hold up the assistants.
who are you? Me?
that's just land surveyor.
I am Pepi.
you have a bath-house in here? We do.
low rank clerks love to steam bath with chambermaids, and Frieda did so when she was a chambermaid.
Frieda? What did you imagine? That she's not like the rest?
earlier there was a spyhole. It got closed after Frieda left. What do you need it for?
Frieda forgot one thing there, I'd like to see if it's in there.
what thing? Klamm's present.
if to know for sure that there's nobody there you could go in and have a look, but it's impossible to know for sure. Klamm is sitting there often.
he's not there.
is that for sure? He's right about to leave, sleigh is in the yard.
that will be long.
what will be long?
until you will leave.
do you want brandy?
I do.
open the door, there's couple of bottles there.
mister land surveyor!
let's go with me.
I am waiting for someone here.
let's go.
I can miss him out that way. Here or there, you will miss him out in any case.
I'll better wait for him here.
Unharness it!
mister land surveyor! Finally.
so, Klamm has left?
sure, you stopped watching him and he left.
well then...let's get started.
I am Momus, Klamm's village secretary. I'd like to hear answers to certain questions of interest to us.
is village secretary high post?
mister Momus is representative is mister Klamm in the village. He receives ??? from the village meant for mister Klamm.
mister Momus holds very important post.
nice. I congratulate you. But now it's time for me to go home.
sure, duty of school caretaker is calling you, but will have to sit here a minute, just two or three questions.
I'm in no mood [for this]. In the name of Klamm I demand!
if I answer your questions, will I be able to see Klamm?
no, there's no connection here.
Goodnight.
he's leaving!
we will not dare to leave!
schwarzer, I know you are not castellan's son.
you won't be interrogated now? No. I refused.
what? Is that important? Yes.
do you think I refused in vain? Yes.
what do you want? Frieda was worried you didn't come long and asked to meet you.
perhaps, you had lost your way. Mister land surveyor!
Barnabas! Do you come to me?
to you! I have a letter for you from Klamm.
land surveying duties performed by you so far have my full consent.
also, work of your assistants is praiseworthy. Continue your efforts...don't worry, everything is under control, Klamm.
that's nonsense. I haven't performed any land surveying duties.
I will deliver it. And I will deliver previous message, too, I memorized everything. Examine me!
haven't you been in the castle yet?
no, I was busy with Brunsvick's musical wheels. What damn wheels?
Klamm, who waits for news from me, is sitting in the castle whole day but you are busy with your stinking wheels!
get out of here!
don't be angry with me. Well, alright. Can you deliver message tomorrow morning and get the answer?
sure, master. So, here it goes:
land surveyor asks for personal admittance and accepts any conditions beforehand.
he has to do this because there are no land surveying duties going on.
village elder and secretary Momus is to blame for this. Tell about us!
land surveyor will do all in his power not to bother mister superion without real need and is really anxios to receive the answer. Repeat!
land surveyor asks for personal admittance and... Attaboy!
can I do something for you? Sisters ??? especially Olga. ??? letter from the castle.
perhaps, she could deliver the message tomorrow? No, she...won't be admitted to registry.
alright. I'll come by tomorrow but you get the answer first.
OK? I'll be in the school. Greetings to your sisters.
how was it?
what?
why it's so cold in here?
it was warm here, but the room is very big and we have run out of wood. How come?
schoolmaster locked the shed and says stoking must be performed during lessons not during night.
not during nights?
hey you!
come here!
find an axe!
enough!
what are you doing!
Frieda!
have you steam bathed with clerks?
I have. That was part of my duty.
is coquettish behaviour towards my assistans also part of your duty?
but darling! Is it possible to pay attention to such small matters? Small matters?
when two spies are watching me - that's small matters? Perhaps, spies are deliberately sent from the castle to bother and observe me all the time - you call that small matters?
how are you conducting yourself, Frieda?
you are madam, you haven't called them to order even once.
I am led to thoughts that you are on their side and you play the same hand.
shush, shush...
good day, mister land surveyor! Hello.
who dared to break open the shed?
I did that, mister schoolmaster. It was necessary to stoke school in the morning and door had to be opened.
I didn't venture to wake you in the middle of the night. And my fiance already rebuked me.
who did break open the shed?
this mister.
our assistans have mixed eveyrting up. I forced the door open with an axe when the assistants were not there.
but when they came they saw my fiance trying to fix the door and they concluded...
so you lied to me?
in that case I will lash you now.
don't!
they told the truth.
so, mister caretaker did this?
[He] who calmly waches how others are punished for his actions.
if my assistants were lashed a little, I had no objections.
well...
of course, you are fired so get out right away with all your stuff.
I don't even think to. Mister elder gave me this post and I will accept discharge only from him.
wonderful.
yes...it wasn't smart to refuse the interrogation.
get out!
you're fired!
and so that I wouldn't see your damn mugs [anymore]!
I fired them.
master, let us in. We won't do that anymore.
let us in! Master!
how could you!
how could you betray me? For the sake of those bastards!
are they dearer to you than I am?
forgive me. Forgive me, please.
let's go away from here; where there is no castle, no Klamm, no assistants, just you and me.
where to? Where to? What for?
I've come here to stay long. I...
Barnabas!
what do you want? I thought perhaps I could help you.
help? How? I don't know.
another helper!
come here.
what's your name? Hans.
what do you want to be, Hans? I want to be like mister land surveyor.
[become a] land surveyor? No.
caretaker? No. I want to be LIKE mister land surveyor.
what is your father doing? Wheels for music boxes.
his wheels are the best in the neighborhood. Wheels my father made is used in all music boxes, even in the castle.
so you are Brunsvick?
was it you whom I saw by the window? Yes.
also, I was at the canteen yesterday with my father and saw you refusing the interrogation.
how is madam Brunsvick?
good. She has asked about you two times already.
listen, Hans, you wanted to help me, didn't you? But you're still little and can't help me but your mom can. I know. When father's in trouble he always asks mother and she goes to the castle.
I need to see your mom very much.
no. My mom must not be disturbed. And father will never allow you.
but we will do it the way he will never know. But that's not fair!
Why? We won't be doing anything bad. You will just say your mom I want to talk with her.
and then you will tell me when your dad's not at home.
as a reward I will teach you to fight with sticks. Really?
Yes. And I will give you glass button. Want it? I do.
well, run, I will be waiting for you in the evening. Just don't say anything to your dad.
have you got sticks? I will make them.
what's your mom's name?
Milena Brunsvick.
well, I'm going...having a walk.
you won't be going to them?
to them? No, what for? Barnabas is bound to come. I'll just walk, have some air.
has Barnabas returned?
lie down, mom. That's land surveyor.
has Barnabas returned? Not yet. Have a seat.
Olga will come out now. She's in the bathing closet.
you know...I...have to run... fiancee is waiting for me at the school.
Oh so!
Hello, mister land surveyor. We thought you wouldn't come. Come through.
land surveyor is in hurry, he must go to his fiancee.
Yes, you know, fiancee is waiting for me.
I just came to see if Barnabas has returned. You'd better come by sometime.
thank you. We will definitely visit you tomorrow.
you know...it was a rash invitation and I must withdraw it because there is some hostility between you and Fieda.
hostility? There is no hostility. Simply, Amalia refuset do be Vallabne's mistress.
Vallabne?
Vallabne. That's very important clerk from the castle, more infliential than Klamm.
haven't Frieda told you?
no. It happened three years ago when Frieda was transferred to the canteen.
our father was one of the most prominent men in the village, he was making wheels for the music boxes for the castle and Brunsvick was a worker of his.
we, his daughters, were very visible and didn't pay attention to the likes of Frieda.
and mrs. inkeeper was very fond with our friendship.
once she gave Amalia ruby beads which fitted her well.
look, these ones.
Vallabne never stayed in the village but that day he saw Amalia through carriage window.
next day courier came with a letter addressed to girl with ruby beads.
letter was written in dirty expressions. It demanded Amalia to go immediately to room number five at Gentlemen's Inn to perform various obscenities with him.
Amalia ripped up the letter and threw it in courier's face.
barmaid Frieda got to know this right away and spread these news throughout the village.
and she pointedly put Amalia in bad light. Why?
because of wickedness. She had the same story with Klamm, only it ended differently.
don't dare to talk like that about my fiancee! She loved Klamm.
forgive me, I didn't want to offend madam Frieda, forgive me.
is that all? No.
Brunsvick came the next day and told he was opening his workshop. He began receiving all orders. Father stopped working completely.
he non-stop wrote letters to castle asking for meeting with Vallabne but all in vain.
soon we settled in this home and Brunsvick - in ours.
so, this is Brunsvick's house.
[people] began to despise us and call us barnabas's wantons.
since then we and our brother are trying to regain respect towards our family.
yesterday Brunsvick told he could help us.
I always knew his wife had good connections in the castle.
Barnabas?
that's not Barnabas, they've come after you.
in the name of Klamm!
mister Momus...
Barnabas? It's not Barnabas, it's your assistant.
tell him I'm not here.
is here another door?
that door leads to the yard but you'll have to crawl over the fence.
what are you hunting here?
you.
who are you?
Jeremiah. Your former assistant.
why former? We are not in your service anymore. I am working at inn now.
and Arthur? He has taken offence from you.
you don't understand jokes.
what have you to do with this? I'm fulfilling Frieda's whish. She has left you and now she's in torment.
what if she was wrong and you didn't go to barnabas's bitches? I didn't go to them, I just came to ask if Barnabas had returned.
Alrigh, I saw everything.
you shouldn't have crawled over the fence.
listen, Jeremiah, we are not master and servant anymore. ?????
let's talk. I don't think so. Frieda is waiting for me.
perhaps, on the way. Mister land surveyor!
mister land surveyor, I succeeded! Barnabas!
you delivered message to Klamm?
no, I didn't do that, but I talked to Erlanger. Who's that?
that's Klamm's assistant. He ordered to tell you that you must go immediately to room number five in Gentlemen's Inn.
he wants to talk to you and inform you about something important.
what?
I am land surveyor! I must see Erlanger in room number five! [Wait until you're] called.
Gerstacker!
Oh, you're still here. I came ???
land surveyor!
is Erlanger important person? Yes, no everything can get solved for you.
only in vain you reject interrogations all the time.
that's hot water bath. It is reccomended for very important misters from the castle.
we have to wait.
hello.
??? to eight.
eight.
Frieda!
frieda, finally I found you.
I was not easy to do in such labyrinths...
why did you leave your wantons? You should go to them. You have better time with them.
I though you were already at the canteen.
Yes, ????
the innkeeper himself asked me to return, only Pepi asked to let her work today.
how good everything has turned out. But why did you decide to return just before the wedding?
there will be no wedding.
you.
always disgraced me with your connections with those bitches.
I haven't eaten today.
haven't you got something, by any chance?
I loved you.
Frieda! You're not allowed here.
it means you don't believe me, your fiance, but wicked slander of his assistant who is deliberately...
why "slander"? I told the truth.
eat, eat...don't be shy.
that's my dinner.
but I will gladly give it to former master.
land surveyor! Land surveyor!
you should've showed up long ago. Lie down.
??? to five.
lie down!
let's get started.
some Frieda who sometimes brought Klamm beer worked in this canteen not so long ago.
some inconveniece derived from her departure.
according to completely credible evidence, land surveyor, that is, you, are living with this person now. You must ensure her immediate return to the canteen.
from my side, I will do too much by saying it will be quite an advantage to subsequent carrer of land surveyor.
that's all. You can go.
mister Erlanger, there has been a mistake.
mister Klamm has been incorrectly informed. There is no land surveying... What concerns land surveying works
usual routine through the messenger.
??? to five.
you are to blame for all of this, mister land surveyor.
because of you Frieda is returning to the canteen, and I have been thrown out just as yourself.
although, I have my little room but you have nowhere to go.
you don't believe me? When elder heard about you not letting Momus in he dismissed you from school caretaker post.
that is how - dismissed? Just so. I heard it myself.
mister land surveyor...
well? Is mom at home?
mister land surveyor, you can't go there!
madam Brunsvick...
Milena...I love you. I love you from the first moment I saw you, I was spellbound by your unusual beauty, ???? as if from the castle. I guessed at once that you came from there. I paint, I even dreamed about becoming a painter my whole life...
for the sake of you, I left duties of land surveyor and took school caretaker's post.
don't reject me. I will leave everything behind, I will have my own way...
we will live in the castle, here's is Klamm's writing... It's not for you to live here, among...
well? Let's get started?
so, are you ready to answer couple simple questions?
wonderful.
then question numer one.
how do you think: what is this?
a hare?
good.
but this?
a whistle.
well, well...
and this?
a [little] ring.
we can finish on this.
perhaps, you will ask more questions?
it wasn't a little ring?
Oh, land surveyor...
it's good that I have found you.
Brunsvick.
I'm pleased.
but we have already met.
let's go out of here.
let's be frank. I know why are you here.
you came to see my wife.
you love her.
I do.
as a man, I understand you.
I'm offering you an honest deal.
you will become Brunsvick, I - land surveyor.
what?
you will become Brunsvick, husband of Milena Brunsvick, father of Hans, one of richest people on the village, but I - poor, lonely land surveyor.
well?
how is this?
very simple. We just need to get permission from mister Vallabne.
Vallabne? Sure. Let's go?
where to?
to Vallabne.
to the castle? Yes. So, you agree?
I do.
that is not the castle.
how? That is a real castle. Mister Vallabne built it especially for hunting.
Hey!
who are you? Mister Vallabne, I am Amalia, the same girl with ruby bead you fell in love with three years ago when you saw me through carriage window.
all these years I was looking forward to see you to tell you that I agree to all the things you asked for in that letter.
you have mixed up something, but you will be present at dinner.
Hey!
and who are you?
me? I am Brunsvick.
he doesn't know you. He doesn't know me yet he knows my wife, Milena Brunsvick.
it's possible, but he doesn't remember.
what do you want? I'd like to become land surveyor.
but land surveyor? Does he agree? Sure! We have talked everything over.
well...
mister Vallabne congratulates you. Thank you.
Hey! Let me in!
let me in!
who is there? That's Brunsvick.
let me in! What does he want?
I don't know.
let me in! Let him in. Miser Vallabne wants to look at him through the little window.
well?
where is he? Where is he!
mister Vallabne, you're being deceived.
mister Klamm, he's my superior, here's... He is deceived.
there is not land surveying works going on. I'm not even hired as land surveyor.
and village elder is plotting...he [Klamm] is deceived and you, too, are being deceived.
this girl, who was here, told she was Amalia. She is not Amalia, she is Olga. I know her.
she's just taken other woman's beads.
and Brunsvick is lying. He told I agreed to be Brunsvick, but I didn't agree. I am land surveyor.
I was summoned to the castle to be land surveyor and I demand, do you hear, I deamnd...
I want to have what's rightfully mine! I don't accept... Mister Brunsvick!
I am Brunsvick?
let it be. He's long gone.
who's gone? Vallabne has gone?
where has he gone?
hunting. How come?
just so.
mister Brunsvick. What brunsvick am I? I am land surveyor!
it's all over. Now I am land surveyor.
Arthur, you? Tell him I am land surveyor. You were my assistant.
those were great days when I served as land surveyor's assistant.
I am land surveyor.
I am land surveyor.
Barnabas!
barnabas, where are you going? I have a letter for mister land surveyor.
that's me!
we're moving in with you tomorrow. My sister has become mistress of mister Vallabne.
what do you want?
I'm here to see Frieda. She's attending Klamm.
Brunsvick?
half night I was looking for you.
Brunsvick!?
Milena, it's me.
it's you?
I was waiting for you.
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long time, but...
I couldn't make up my mind.
in short words - I'm in love with land surveyor.
Milena...
it's me, Milena.
please, don't. It has been settled. He loves me.
I hope you will take care of father.
and put on a coat or you'll catch cold.
will you finish soon?
just a moment.
barnabas, read this passage one more time.
...taking in account professional diligence, today mister land surveyor is allowed to listen to any music...
did you make the sticks?
sticks?
you promised to teach me to fight with sticks. Do you remember?
and you promised to give me glass button.
who? Me?
stop now.
tell me where it is.
you and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours.
l don't know what you are talking about.
ls it a secret you will die for?
please. -As you wish.
wait!
my god, forgive me.
ln the sacristy...
...the church of Saint-Sulpice, is the Rose Line.
beneath the Rose.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
symbols are a language that can help us understand our past.
as the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words...
...but which words?
lnterpret for me, please, this symbol. First thing that comes to mind.
hatred, racism. -Ku Klux Klan.
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would disagree with you in Spain.
there, they are robes worn by priests.
now this symbol. Anyone?
evil.
ln English, please.
devil's pitchfork.
poor, poor Poseidon.
that is his trident. A symbol of power to millions of the ancients.
now this symbol.
Madonna and child. -Faith. Christianity.
no. No, it's the pagan god Horus and his mother, lsis...
...centuries before the birth of Christ.
understanding our past determines actively...
...our ability to understand the present.
so how do we sift truth from belief?
how do we write our own histories, personally or culturally...
...and thereby define ourselves?
how do we penetrate years, centuries, of historical distortion...
...to find original truth?
tonight, this will be our quest.
my son is a student of yours at Harvard.
michael Culp? He adores you. -Oh, yeah.
he says you're the best teacher he's ever had.
ms. Culp, l think l already gave Michael an A-minus.
he told me. Thank you.
Hi.
Bonjour, professor.
l'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ. A kind of French FBl.
will you take a look at this photo, please?
my police chief, Capitaine Fache, had hoped...
...considering your expertise and the markings on the body...
...you might assist us.
will you excuse me a moment?
l was supposed to have drinks with him.
Yes, we know.
we found your name in his daily planner.
he never showed. l waited for over an hour.
why would someone do this to him?
he was shot, yes.
but what you see in the photograph...
...Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.
teacher, all four are dead.
the senechaux and the grand Master himself.
then l assume you have the location.
confirmed by all.
lndependently.
l had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail.
the prospect of death is strong motivation.
lt is here.
ln Paris, Teacher.
lt hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.
you will go forth, Silas.
l chastise my body.
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.
okay.
Mr. Langdon. -Yes.
l'm Captain Bezu Fache.
you like our pyramid?
lt's magnificent.
a scar on the face of Paris.
after me, please.
lt's the pairing of those two pyramids.
lt's unique.
the two are geometric echoes.
fascinating.
l'm not sure how much help l'm gonna be here this evening.
how well did you know the curator?
not very well.
frankly, l was surprised when he contacted me.
could we take the stairs?
so Sauniere requested tonight's meeting.
Yes.
how? Did he call you?
e-mail. He heard l was in Paris.
had something to discuss.
what?
you seem uncomfortable.
the grand gallery. This is where you found the body.
how would you know that?
l recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid. lt's unmistakable.
dear god.
let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence.
many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.
others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society.
obviously, some people fear what they don't understand.
perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.
the press continue to be harsh with us.
we are not Cafeteria Catholics.
we don't pick and choose which rules to follow.
we follow doctrine. Rigorously.
does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing...
...and atonement for sins through self-flagellation and the cilice?
many of our followers are married. Many of them have families.
only a small proportion choose to live ascetic lives.
why are some media referring--? -That will be all, Michael, thank you.
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.
lt hides beneath the Rose.
my part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.
l meet the council in an hour.
l will have your money tonight, Teacher.
the Vitruvian Man.
lt's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches.
and the star on his skin?
a pentacle.
and its meaning?
the pentacle is a pagan religious icon.
devil worship.
no. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.
this is a symbol for Venus.
lt represents the female half of all things
you are telling me that Sauniere's last act on earth...
...was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest? Why?
captain Fache, obviously l can't tell you why.
l can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol...
...and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil.
ls that so? -Yes.
then...
...what do you make of this?
'o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint. "
lt's a phrase. Doesn't mean anything, not to me.
what would you do if you had such limited time to send a message?
well, l suppose l'd try to identify my killer.
precisely.
precisely.
so, professor
officer Neveu.
please, pardon the interruption.
this is not the time.
l received the crime-scene jpegs at headquarters...
...and l've deciphered the code.
lt's a Fibonacci sequence.
that's the code Sauniere left on the floor.
headquarters sent me to explain, captain.
lt is the Fibonacci sequence.
the numbers are out of order.
but before that, l have an urgent message for Professor Langdon.
right?
pardon me?
l'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.
your embassy called Division.
l'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death.
this is the number of your embassy's messaging service.
well, thank you.
Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu.
miss Neveu? This...
no. That's the right number.
you have to dial an access code to pick up your messages.
but l'm getting
lt's a three-digit code. lt's on the paper l gave you.
professor Langdon, do not react to this message.
you must follow my directions very closely and, above all...
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.
you are in grave danger.
church of Saint-Sulpice.
good evening, Sister.
l need you to show someone our church tonight.
of course, Father.
but so late?
wouldn't tomorrow...?
this is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei.
lt would be my pleasure.
there's been an accident. A friend.
l have to fly home in the morning.
l see.
ls there a restroom l could use? l just wanna splash some water on my face.
Yes.
she said it is meaningless.
mathematical joke.
ls it meaningless?
l'll take another look when l come back.
l'm sorry. Of course.
do you have a message from Sauniere?
what are you talking about?
crazy old man.
you have me confused with someone else. l came here to
check your jacket pocket.
just look.
GPS tracking dot.
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.
the agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket...
...in case you tried to run.
we have you on a little leash, professor.
why would l try to run? l didn't do anything.
so, what do you think about the fourth line of text...
...Fache wiped clean before you arrived?
he brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon.
he's still in there? What's he doing?
Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay?
he is sure you're guilty.
when did Sauniere contact you?
today? -Yes, yes.
what time? What time?
at 3. Around 3. Three.
we call Fache " the Bull. " Once he starts, he doesn't stop.
he can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case.
and by then whatever Sauniere wanted you to tell me will be useless.
stop it! Just stop!
who are you?
look at the letters.
P. S. postscript.
' princesse Sophie. " Silly, l know.
but l was only a girl when l lived with him.
jacques Sauniere was my grandfather.
apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet.
lf you help me understand why...
...l will get you to your embassy, where we cannot arrest you.
Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he?
no.
lf we are to get away from here, we must find another way.
what exactly do you propose?
Sauniere was reading his book.
" blood trail. "
excuse me, captain.
we have a problem.
headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.
what?
captain, look at this.
he jumped!
shit.
he's moving again. And fast.
he must be in a car.
he's going south on Pont du Carrousel.
bastard.
that cop will check the whole lower floor.
l will only take a moment.
of course.
he is much older than l remember.
l hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time.
he phoned my office today. Several times.
he said it was a matter of life and death.
l thought it was another trick to get back in touch.
lt seems when he couldn't speak to me...
...he reached out to you.
wait a minute. -Professor?
this is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.
the Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order.
these are scrambled.
lf he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code.
would you hold this, please?
this phrase is meaningless.
unless you assume these letters are out of order too.
an anagram.
you have eidetic memory?
not quite. But l can pretty much remember what l see.
anagram is right.
'o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint " becomes:
" Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa. "
professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.
look at this. He must have thrown it from the window.
smart to hit the truck.
what, you admire him now?
we're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum?
Ledoux? get him on the radio!
her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies.
the horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right.
Why?
well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right.
historically, the left was female, the right was male.
there. Blood.
Hey.
'so dark the con of man. "
no. lt doesn't say that.
ls it another anagram? Can you break it?
professor, hurry. Hurry!
moon. Sermon. Charms.
demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.
Madonna of the Rocks.
da Vinci.
careful. Careful.
this can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.
lt was Sauniere's.
l remember finding it once when l was a girl.
he'd promised he'd give it to me one day.
have you ever heard those words before, Sophie?
'so dark the con of man " ?
no. Have you?
when you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings?
anything ritualistic in nature?
meetings your grandfather would've wanted k ept secret?
was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion?
the what? Why are you asking these things?
the Priory of Sion is a myth.
one of the world's oldest and most secret societies, with leaders like...
...Sir lsaac Newton, da Vinci himself.
the fleur-de-lis is their crest.
they're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to...
...as " the dark con of man. "
but what secret?
the Priory of Sion protects the source of god's power on earth.
l can't do this by myself.
l'm in enough trouble as it is. That's my embassy.
please.
even if we could get out of this
okay.
no, no, no. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it!
well, that was...
we need to get out of sight.
Christ, give me strength.
you are a ghost.
Christ, give me strength.
stealing in a house of god!
you are an angel.
Christ, give me strength.
you have powerful friends.
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.
l could not miss this chance to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.
a pity you couldn't wait for morning.
the light is not ideal.
tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.
a rose line is any line that goes from the North to South Poles.
set into the streets of Paris, 1 35 brass markers...
...mark the world's first prime meridian...
...which passed through this very church.
lt hides beneath the Rose.
l'm sorry?
sister.
l do not want to keep you. l will show myself out.
l insist.
may the peace of the Lord be with you.
and with you.
they found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station.
and two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card.
a decoy, l'm sure.
all the same, send an officer to the station.
question all the taxi drivers. l'll put this on the wire.
lnterpol? We're not sure he's guilty.
l know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.
robert Langdon is guilty.
this is the Bois de Boulogne?
we should be safe in this park for a few minutes.
stay here.
police.
what do you want?
fifty euros for all your stuff.
go and get something to eat.
did it occur to you that could be dangerous?
no. And now we have a place to think.
any ideas, professor?
you could've just handed me a piece of a UFO from Area 51 .
'what's the next step? "
with him, it's always:
'Sophie, what's the next step? "
puzzles.
codes.
a treasure hunt.
to find his killer.
maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion.
l hope not.
any Priory story ends in bloodshed. They were butchered by the Church.
lt all started over a thousand years ago when a French king...
... conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.
this crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history...
...was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood...
...the Priory of Sion...
...and their military arm, the Knights Templar.
but the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.
that was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth.
supposedly the invasion was to find an artefact...
... lost since the time of Christ.
an artefact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess.
did they find it, this buried treasure?
put it this way:
one day the Templars simply stopped searching.
they quit the Holy Land and travelled directly to Rome.
whether they blackmailed the papacy...
... or the Church bought their silence, no one knows.
but it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights...
... these Knights Templar, of limitless power.
by the 1 300s, the Templars had grown too powerful.
too threatening.
so the Vatican issued secret orders...
... to be opened simultaneously all across Europe.
the Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers...
...and said god had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics.
the plan went off like clockwork.
the Templars were all but exterminated.
the date was October 1 3th, 1 30 7. A Friday.
friday the 1 3th.
the Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure...
...but they found nothing.
the few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished...
...and the search for their sacred artefact began again.
what artefact? l've never heard about any of this.
Yes, you have.
almost everyone on earth has.
you just know it as the Holy grail.
please, Sauniere thought he knew the location of the Holy grail?
maybe more than that.
this cross and the flower, this could be very old. But look.
this metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern lD stamp.
and these dots. These dots are read by a laser.
this is more than a pendant. This is a key your grandfather left you.
he left us, professor.
and vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an lD stamp.
lt's a street address.
this is Jacques Sauniere.
please leave a message after the tone.
please, Monsieur Sauniere, pick up the phone.
this is Sandrine Bieil.
l have called the list.
l fear the other guardians are dead.
the lie has been told.
the floor panel has been broken.
please, monsieur, pick up the phone. l beg you.
job 38, verse 1 1 .
do you know it, Sister?
job 38: 1 1 .
hitherto shalt thou come...
...but no further.
' but no further. "
do you mock me?
where is the keystone?
l do not know.
no.
you are a sister of the Church...
...and yet you serve them: the Priory.
Jesus had but one true message. That
come, you saints of god.
hasten, angels of the Lord.
to receive her soul.
and bring her to the sight of the Almighty.
welcome, bishop.
this council is convened.
our words shall never pass these walls.
what business, say you?
as you know, my request for funds
Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds.
a tad more than petty cash. Wouldn't you say, bishop?
l only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men.
how humble.
our saviour, Bishop Aringarosa.
how dare you presume to
l do not presume, l act!
the Vatican's unwillingness to support us...
...is both impious and cowardly.
blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins. No more!
this council has forgotten its very purpose.
tonight...
...the grail will be destroyed.
the Priory's few remaining members will be silenced.
l was contacted by a man who calls himself only " the Teacher. "
two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu...
...getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne.
because of your expertise?
l'm sorry? -About the Priory.
do you think that's why Sauniere sought you out?
l can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it.
actually, l didn't think he liked me very much.
once made a joke at my expense. got a big laugh out of it.
what was it?
how may l help you?
the door to the right, please.
good evening. l am Andre Vernet, the night manager.
l take it this is your first visit to our establishment?
Yes.
understood.
keys are often passed on and first-time users...
...are sometimes uncertain of protocol.
keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.
often willed through generations.
ls it yours, mademoiselle?
the shortest safety-deposit-box lease is 50 years.
and what's your longest account?
quite a bit longer.
technologies change, keys are updated.
once the computer confirms your key...
...enter your account number and your box is retrieved.
the room is yours, as long as you like.
what if l lost track of my account number?
how might l recover it?
l'm afraid each key is paired with a 1 0-digit number...
...known only to the account bearer.
l hope you manage to remember it.
a single wrong entry disables the system.
ten. -Ten.
your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.
scrambled, unscrambled?
unscrambled.
lt's your key.
funny, l don't even like history.
l've never seen much good come from looking to the past.
moment of truth.
my god. l don't believe this.
a rose.
the rose was a symbol for the Holy grail.
forgive the intrusion.
l'm afraid the police arrived more quickly than l anticipated.
you must follow me, please.
for your own safety.
you knew they were coming?
my guard alerted me to your status when you arrived.
yours is one of our oldest and highest-level accounts.
lt includes a safe-passage clause.
safe passage?
lf you would step inside, please. Time is of the essence.
ln there?
Hey, is there a problem?
good evening, sir. Police.
l just drive from here to Zurich. Not French, English?
English? -Yes.
we are looking for two criminals.
you came to the right place. They're all criminals here.
would you mind opening the hold?
please. You think they trust us, the wages l get paid?
you don't have keys to your own truck?
lt's armoured. Keys get sent to the destination.
you mind? l'm on a schedule here.
and do all the drivers wear a Rolex?
what?
this piece of shit.
forty euros in Barbes.
yours for 35.
no, no, no.
thirty. -No. lt's okay, it's okay.
come on, 30, eh?
l said, no!
move along!
now we wait.
the Teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money.
you have put tremendous faith in this Teacher of yours.
Yes, l have. And l have given him an angel to do his will.
for surely there is no better soldier for god than my Silas.
l firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins...
...to do penance and to amend my life.
Amen.
the Holy grail.
a magic cup. The source of god's power on earth.
lt's nonsense.
you don't believe in god.
no.
just people.
sometimes that they can be kind.
are you a god-fearing man, professor?
l was raised a Catholic.
well, that's not really an answer.
professor, are you okay?
go ahead, open it.
go on.
a cryptex.
they are used to keep secrets.
lt's da Vinci's design.
you write the information on a papyrus scroll...
...which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar.
lf you force it open, the vial breaks...
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...
...and your secret is lost forever.
the only way to access the information...
...is to spell out the password...
...with these five dials, each with 26 letters.
that's 1 2 million possibilities.
l've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex.
Sauniere made one for me once.
my grandfather gave me a wagon.
this clearly is not the Holy grail.
come on.
please, you're not all right.
may l try something?
l don't know why it works.
my mother used to do it when l was scared, l think.
you think?
Yes.
feeling better, Sophie?
my parents died in a car crash with my brother.
l was 4.
l'm sorry.
lt was many years ago.
better?
Yeah.
okay.
twenty years waiting for someone to come for that box...
...and now it's you two murderers. Bring it to me.
l don't know what you're talking about.
all right! Okay!
right now!
step back!
no one will lose sleep over a couple on a killing spree.
turn around.
turn around!
you too, mademoiselle.
get in the truck!
l'll drive! Hurry!
what happened between you and your grandfather, exactly?
l've jammed my shoulder, l've been shot at, l'm bleeding.
l need to know.
you say he raised you, but you two don't talk anymore.
you call him by his last name.
you say you hate history.
nobody hates history. They hate their own histories.
so now you're a psychologist too?
what if Sauniere had started to groom you for the Priory?
what do you mean, groom me?
your grandfather gave you puzzles and cryptex as a child.
so you are saying all this is real? The Priory, the Holy grail?
we've been dragged into a world of people who think this stuff is real.
real enough to kill for. -Who?
l'm out of my field here.
l do know a grail historian, absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.
an Englishman, lives here in France.
do you trust this man?
l hope you can.
lt seems you're not a driver at all.
apparently, you lost your tongue along with your truck.
you think you're in pain now, Andre Vernet?
my cause is worth your life. Understand?
what do you want?
your truck carries a homing device. Activate it.
please wait. l'll see if he's available.
lt's on the wrong side.
Leigh likes all things to be English, including his cars.
Robert! Do l owe you money?
Leigh, my friend...
...care to open up for an old colleague?
of course. -Thank you.
but first, a test of honour.
three questions.
fire away.
your first.'
shall l serve coffee or tea?
tea, of course.
excellent.
Second.' milk or lemon?
milk?
that would depend on the tea.
correct.
and now the third and most grave of inquiries.'
ln which year did a Harvard sculler outrow an Oxford man at Henley?
surely such a travesty has never occurred.
your heart is true.
you may pass.
welcome to Chateau Villette.
the truck's signal is coming online.
lt's about time.
locked on and tracking, sir.
very good. Tell Collet not to move in until l get there.
attention! All of Collet's units to Chateau Villette.
the suspects Neveu and Langdon are lik ely at that location.
l still don't know why he put you into this...
...and l'm sorry.
but...
...l'm also very glad.
you are requested to make yourself at home.
and you travel with a maiden, it seems.
sir Leigh Teabing, may l present Miss Sophie Neveu.
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.
lt's an honour to welcome you...
...even though it's late.
thank you for having us. l realize it's quite late.
so late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.
what a lovely smile you have.
Earl grey?
lemon.
correct.
Chateau Villette. Yes.
a dramatic late-night arrival.
what can an old cripple do for you, Robert?
we wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.
the keepers?
the secret war?
sorry for all the mystery.
Leigh, l'm into something here that l cannot understand.
you?
Really? -Not without your help.
playing to my vanity, Robert. You should be ashamed.
not if it works.
there are always four:
the grand Master and the three senechaux...
...make up the primary guardians of the grail.
thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now.
the Priory's members span our very globe itself.
philippe de Cherisey exposed that as a hoax in 1 967.
and that is what they want you to believe.
the Priory is charged with a single task:
to protect the greatest secret in modern history.
the source of god's power on earth.
no, that's a common misunderstanding.
the Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth:
the Holy grail.
l don't understand.
what power? Some magic dishes?
Robert. Has he been telling you that the Holy grail is a cup?
the good Book did not arrive by facsimile from heaven.
the Bible as we know it was finally presided over by one man:
the pagan emperor Constantine.
l thought Constantine was a Christian.
Oh, hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan...
...who was baptized on his deathbed.
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.
from time immemorial...
...his people had worshiped a balance between nature's male deities...
...and the goddess, or sacred feminine.
but a growing religious turmoil was gripping Rome.
three centuries earlier...
...a young Jew named Jesus had come along...
...preaching love and a single god.
centuries after his crucifixion...
... Christ's followers had grown exponentially...
...and had started a religious war against the pagans.
or did the pagans commence war against the Christians?
Leigh, we can't be sure who began the atrocities in that period.
we can at least agree that the conflict grew to such proportions...
...that it threatened to tear Rome in two.
so Constantine may have been a lifelong pagan...
...but he was also a pragmatist.
and in 325 anno Domini...
...he decided to unify Rome under a single religion, Christianity.
christianity was on the rise. He didn't want his empire torn apart.
and to strengthen this new Christian tradition...
...Constantine held a famous ecumenical gathering...
...known as the Council of Nicaea.
and at this council...
... the many sects of Christianity debated and v oted on, well...
... everything, from the acceptance and rejection of specific gospels...
... to the date for Easter...
...to the administering of the sacraments, and of course...
...the immortality of Jesus.
l don't follow.
well, ma chere, until that moment in history...
...Jesus was viewed by many of his followers as a mighty prophet...
...as a great and powerful man, but a man nevertheless.
a mortal man.
not the Son of god?
not even his nephew twice removed.
Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity.
he simply sanctioned an already widely held idea.
semantics. -No, it's not semantics.
you're interpreting facts to support your own conclusions.
fact: For many Christians, Jesus was mortal one day and divine the next.
for some Christians, his divinity was enhanced.
absurd. There was a formal announcement of his promotion.
they couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed!
excuse me. " Who is god, who is man? "
how many have been murdered over this question?
as long as there has been a one true god...
...there has been killing in his name.
now let me show you the grail.
l trust you recognize The Last Supper...
...the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.
now, my dear, if you would close your eyes.
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlour tricks.
you asked for my help, l recall.
allow an old man his indulgences.
now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting?
ln the middle. -good.
he and his disciples are breaking bread.
and what drink?
wine. They drank wine.
splendid. And one final question:
how many wineglasses are there on the table?
one? The Holy grail?
open your eyes.
no single cup.
no chalice.
well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?
considering both the Bible and standard grail legend...
...celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the Holy grail.
now, Robert, you could be of help to us.
lf you'd be so kind as to show us the symbols for man and woman, please.
no balloon animals. l can make a great duck.
this is the original icon for male. lt's a rudimentary phallus.
quite to the point. -Yes, indeed.
this is known as the blade.
lt represents aggression and manhood.
lt's a symbol still used today in modern military uniforms.
Yes, the more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.
now, as you would imagine, the female symbol is its exact opposite.
this is called the chalice.
and the chalice resembles a cup or vessel or, more importantly...
...the shape of a woman's womb.
no, the grail has never been a cup.
lt is quite literally this ancient symbol of womanhood.
and in this case, a woman who carried a secret so powerful...
...that if revealed, it would devastate the very foundations of Christianity.
wait, please.
you're saying the Holy grail is a person? A woman?
and it turns out, she makes an appearance right there.
but they are all men.
are they?
what about that figure on the right hand of our Lord...
...seated in the place of honour?
flowing red hair.
folded feminine hands.
hint of a bosom. No?
lt's called scotoma. The mind sees what it chooses to see.
who is she?
my dear, that's Mary Magdalene.
the prostitute?
she was no such thing.
smeared by the Church in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.
this is an old wives' tale.
the original one, in fact.
there's virtually no empirical proof.
he knows as well as l do there's much evidence to support it.
theories. There are theories.
notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.
mirror images of each other.
the mind sees what it chooses to see.
and venturing into the even more bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...
...appear to be joined at the hip and are leaning away from each other...
...as if to create a shape in the negative space between them.
Leonardo gives us the chalice.
Yes. Oh, and Robert, notice what happens...
...when these two figures change position.
just because da Vinci painted it doesn't make it true.
no. But history...
...she does make it true.
now, listen to this. lt's from the gospel according to Philip.
Philip?
Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea...
...along with any other gospels that made...
...Jesus appear human and not divine.
'and the companion of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene.
christ loved her more than all the disciples...
...and used to kiss her on the-- "
but this says nothing of marriage.
well, actually...
actually, in those days, the word " companion " literally meant " spouse. "
and this is from the gospel of Mary Magdalene herself.
she wrote a gospel? -She may have.
Robert, will you fight fair? -She may have.
'and Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?'
and Levi answered:
Peter, l see you contending against a woman like an adversary.
lf the Saviour made her worthy, who are you, indeed, to reject her? " '
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...
...that it's up to her to continue his Church.
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.
the Church was supposed to be carried on by a woman.
few realize that Mary was descended from kings, just as her husband was.
now, my dear, the word in French for Holy grail.
from the Middle English " Sangreal " ...
...of the original Arthurian legend.
now, as two words. Can you translate for our friend?
sang real, it means " royal blood. "
when the legend speaks of the chalice that held the blood of Christ...
...it speaks in fact of the female womb that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.
but how could Christ have a bloodline, unless--?
Mary was pregnant at the time of the Crucifixion.
for her own safety and for that of Christ's unborn child...
...she fled the Holy Land and came to France.
and here, it is said, she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.
they know the child's name.
a little girl. -Yes.
lf that were true, it's adding insult to injury.
Why?
the pagans found transcendence through the joining of male to female.
people found god through sex?
ln paganism, women were worshiped as a route to heaven...
...but the modern Church has a monopoly on that...
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.
and he who keeps the keys to heaven rules the world.
women, then, are a huge threat to the Church.
the Catholic lnquisition soon publishes...
... what may be the most blood-soak ed book in human history.
the Malleus Maleficarum.
the Witches' Hammer.
lt instructed the clergy on how to locate, torture and kill...
...all freethinking women.
ln three centuries of witch hunts...
... 50, 000 women are captured, burned alive at the stak e.
Oh, at least that. Some say millions.
lmagine, then, Robert...
...that Christ's throne might live on in a female child.
you asked what would be worth killing for.
witness the greatest cover-up in human history.
this is the secret that the Priory of Sion...
...has defended for over 20 centuries.
they are the guardians of the royal bloodline.
the keepers of the proof of our true past.
they are the protectors of the living descendants of Jesus Christ...
...and Mary Magdalene.
sir Leigh?
sometimes l wonder who is serving whom.
his sauces are not that fantastic.
Yes, can l help you?
Yes. They're on the news now.
living descendants? ls it possible?
lt's not impossible.
you have not been honest with me. Your pictures are on the television.
you are wanted for four murders!
that's why Vernet said " killing spree. "
you come into my home, playing on my passions for the grail.
that's why he needed you. -You will leave my house!
Leigh, listen! -No, l'm calling the police.
jacques Sauniere was her grandfather.
you're the obsessive Priory scholar.
you still keep lists of who might be in the Priory?
l'll bet Jacques Sauniere was on one of those lists.
he was on your list of who could be grand Master, wasn't he?
what? -l'll bet he was right at the top.
consider: Four men murdered? The same number as the guardians.
what if the Priory was compromised, the other senechaux dead?
what if you yourself were dying, a grand Master?
you'd have to pass the secret on to someone you could trust.
someone outside the society.
maybe someone whose training you had begun but never finished.
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.
not really.
no, that's impossible.
can that really--?
ls it the keystone?
l'll even show it to you, Leigh.
will you just tell us what the hell it's for?
Fache says to wait, so l wait.
what's Fache thinking? The truck is here. They're inside.
Yes.
as the legend foretold:
' lt hides beneath the Rose. "
Oh, my god.
please.
l'm sorry. Yes, of course.
lnside the keystone...
...there'll be a map.
a map that will lead us to the Holy grail.
to be trained by the grand Master himself.
did he pass down the fleur-de-lis? ls that how you found this?
and he must have sung you the riddle songs.
l know some of them.
can you keep secrets?
can you know a thing and never say it again?
and codes?
l imagine they lie down for you like lovers.
a senechal. A guardian of the grail right here in my own home.
tell him, please. l don't know any of this.
Leigh, it's not that simple. She doesn't rem
do not move, woman.
cripple.
put the box on the table.
what, this trifle?
well, perhaps we can make a financial arrangement.
put the keystone on the table.
you will not succeed.
only the worthy can unlock the stone.
rip the gate down.
well, well, my dear.
sit down.
are you okay? -Yeah, yeah.
are you? -Yeah.
Yes, well, make yourself useful, you French fool.
get something to restrain this monster.
above the joint.
fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay.
he's wearing a cilice.
a what? -Well, look.
lnflicts pain so he can suffer as Christ suffered.
opus Dei.
Fache is Opus Dei.
the policeman who's chasing us. He wears the cross in the world.
well, l must say, you two are anything but dull.
you want what's in this box?
we need a way out of here.
well, actually...
...l do have a plane.
Robert! Where do we go? -Come along.
ln here. Come in. -Over here.
get the door. Hurry.
over here. Over here. Sophie.
watch out!
be careful.
18 Months Earlier
Jack, this is hard for me.
the Chinese have proof that you led the assault on their consulate.
and now the Chinese want me.
that's right.
listen to me very carefully.
the man they sent to take you into custody has orders to kill you.
orders from who?
someone in Logan's camp.
bill Spaulding, Secret Service.
I have orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.
I intend to execute those orders.
he's dead.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Jack!
give me the epinephrine.
I hope it's not too late. He really looks dead.
come on, Jack!
come on, Jack, damn it!
Hey.
all right, Chloe,
I need you to run interference with the local coroner.
make sure their database synchs up with Jack's information.
that won't cover the autopsy.
there's not going to be an autopsy.
they wanted Jack dead, now he's dead.
Mr. President, you saved my life.
I'm only sorry it came to this.
I just wanted to let you know that I was out.
I'm glad.
Jack, you do understand that when you hang up, for all intents and purposes,
Jack Bauer is dead.
I understand that, sir.
Mr. President, it's been an honor.
the following takes place between 7am and 8am mojave, california
Jim Nichols! You're on pump number one.
you're on pump number four.
you're on pump five.
sorry, guys, that's all I got today.
Hey, Frank?
look, I-I know I promised you work today, but...
pump seven went off-line last night.
that's all right. I'll try again tomorrow.
Yeah, tomorrow'll be much better.
see you tomorrow.
la, canifornia
the sun is shining, but the air is cool at President Logan's retreat, where Russian President Yuri Suvarov is expected to arrive later this morning.
everything worked for me, up until the chapter on your first campaign.
I'm sorry, but I think it's a little long-winded, and I think that we can cut that down by half.
you didn't hear a word I just said, did you?
Yes, I was listening.
no, you weren't.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
are you okay?
I can use a break.
what's going on?
what do you mean?
I mean you've been distracted ever since you got to Los Angeles.
I don't know, it's...
it's like you're somewhere else.
writing my memoirs...
maybe it's put me in a melancholy mood.
is that all it is?
Yeah.
David... I'm your brother.
whatever it is, you can tell me.
it's all right, really.
okay.
well, then let's get back to work.
one more chapter, and we'll take a break.
why don't we jump down to, um, Chapter Six?
there's going to be a lot of questions about your relationship with Sherry.
no, no, no, no, no...
get help!
stay with me.
stay with me! Get help!
presidential Retreat Hidden Valley ca
my chair?
don't worry, Mr. President. I had it adjusted.
good.
adjusted? Wait a minute. What are we talking about here?
Yuri Suvarov is over six feet.
russian President can't be looking down on the President of the United States when the cameras roll.
that's a risky proposition, Walt.
the press finds out about it, and...
they won't.
don't underestimate the power of the image, Mike.
stalin and Churchill, they both sat for FDR at Yalta.
this is the defining moment of my administration.
we have to make sure that the media presents it the right way.
I'll get it.
Yeah, put him through.
have you checked on my wife?
Ah, she's still getting ready.
she'll be fine, sir.
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill.
I'd feel better if you would check on her yourself.
she cannot have one of her meltdowns today.
look...
you're the only one she listens to, Walt.
Yes, sir.
thank you.
Mike, what is it?
david Palmer's been assassinated.
What?!
it just happened.
Oh, my God.
where?
in L. A.
I don't believe this.
Mr. President, uh, CTU is standing by to brief you directly.
whenever you're ready.
make sure LAPD sets up a hard perimeter.
they're sending everyone they've got.
where are they on witnesses? - Nowhere yet.
who's running search and sweep?
secret Service, but they're shorthanded.
narrow the search area.
make sure ballistics runs a line-of-fire trajectory.
sir, President Logan's ready.
I'll call ballistics.
put the President through.
Mr. President.
not to diminish the loss that we're all feeling right now, but I'm expecting the Russian President very soon, so...
let's say what needs to be said.
of course, sir.
have you arrested the person who did this?
not yet, sir.
then what do you have?
sir, the damage inflicted by the single shot indicates that President Palmer was hit by a 308-caliber bullet fired from an adjacent building.
we've initiated an interagency protocol, level five...
don't... don't give me protocols, Bill.
give me results.
whoever did this, I want them dead or in custody by the time the Russians get here.
Yes, Mr. President.
but until we know more,
I would ask that you consider postponing the signing of the treaty, sir.
no. Absolutely not.
Mr. President, we can't discount the possibility that this attack is somehow connected to the arms agreement.
a former president was assassinated 15 miles from where you are.
and I'm sure I don't need to explain the significance of this day.
do you realize what kind of political and economic capital
I've spent just to get the Russians to the table?
if we call this off, they won't come back.
what?
get out of my bed.
Yeah.
I had a good time last night, too.
I'm serious. This was a mistake.
get out of here.
what do you mean, a mistake?
we had a great time.
I don't get involved with people who work for me.
it's too late for that.
I would appreciate it if you didn't tell everybody at work about this.
I don't want everyone thinking I'm some kind of slut.
believe me, no one's ever going to think that.
what's that supposed to mean?
you should lighten up, you know?
you'll live longer.
what are you doing?
when you quit overanalyzing the situation,
I think you're gonna find out that you and I are pretty good together.
so I'm telling you advce, yes.
Yes, what?
I'll let you buy me dinner.
get me drunk. Have your way with me.
anytime you want.
you know, um, arrogance doesn't turn me on.
I've read that some women respond to it, but I'm just letting you know, I don't.
what is it?
president Palmer's been shot.
he's dead.
president Palmer Assassinated
who is it?
it's me, Frank.
I saw your truck outside.
I thought you were on today.
Ned didn't need me this morning.
it's so terrible, what happened.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
come on, I'm making breakfast.
okay.
Frank's gonna join us.
great.
Derek, stop it.
morning.
use a glass, please.
here.
excuse me.
can I ask you something, Frank?
Yeah, sure.
that rig in Alaska you worked on, what was that called again?
the Albatross.
and you were thereast year?
Yeah, why?
it's funny.
my friend's got a brother who's been working on that rig for five years and he's never heard of any Frank Flynn.
it's a big platform.
Yeah, well, my friend's brother says everyone knows everyone.
what is this, an interrogation?
I just don't like being lied to.
no, it's all right.
no one's lying to you, Derek.
Really?
when you're out there, a lot of the guys just use nicknames.
Yeah.
what's your friend's brother's name?
eat your breakfast.
Yeah, I'm not hungry.
sorry.
he's just kind of protective of me.
but it's the best thing in the world for him to have a man around here.
look, what he said about me and Alaska...
you don't owe me an explanation.
I figure if you had wanted I me about your past you would have told me already.
I trust my instincts.
and I trust you.
former President David Palmer was killed just a short while ago.
now, no information has been released to the public athis time, but an independent source has verified that Palmer was in Los Angeles visiting his brother and former White...
bill will call if he needs us, you know that.
no, he won't.
authorities are remaining very tightlipped as the LAPD and Secret Service seal off the area, and there has been no word on whether this was an accident...
it's not our job.
not anymore.
this is different.
come on, Michelle.
I'm just as upset as you are.
david Palmer meant a lot to me, too.
but there are other people at CTU who can handle this.
no one who was active during the other attempts onis life.
Tony, you and I worked up suspect profiles.
we ran scenarios.
and theyAneth our records on file.
they don't have our experience.
I never once regretted our decision to leave CTU.
but I don't want to look back on today and realize I could have helped.
we're running a business here, Michelle.
Rick Rosen is expecting us to make a presentation in less than an hour.
you can handle the meeting on your own.
Michelle, don't do this.
it's Rick. Leave me a message.
Yeah, Rick, it's Tony Almeida.
look, I just wanted to call you and let you know that Michelle's not gonna be able to make our meeting today.
she had to go someplace.
on second thought...
I'm going with her.
did Jepson brief you on what's happening?
said there was a car bombing.
two former CTU agents were hit.
Yeah, their names are Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.
you knew them?
Yeah.
we're data-mining for a connection between them and President Palmer.
I sent the parameters to your screen.
I'll get on it.
yeah?
it's Edgar. Are you coming in?
,I just, I paged on a level five protocol,
x of crse I'm coming in.
I wanted to give you aveeads up before you got here.
heads up?
it's bad, Chloe.
Yeah, President Palmer was gunned down.
I'd say that's pretty bad.
it's not just him.
what are you talking about?
someone planted a bomb in Michelle Dessler's car.
what?
Michelle's dead.
he Tony's not doing too good.
doesn't make any sense.
they were retired.
Buchanan thinks it's lind to Palmer somehow.
we're cross-referencing everything we have on Palmer with Tony and Michelle, to see if we can find a connection, anything they may have had in common.
go.
Chloe? - I'll call you back.
I'll call you back! - Why? Chloe?
since I don't have to go to work today,
I can take care of the fence out back if you want. wa
Oh, that'd be great.
I can't thank you enough for all the work you've down around here.
it's t least I could do.
excuse me.
yeah?
Jack, I know this isn't protocol.
please don't hang up on me. I need your help.
uh, hold on, I can barely hear you.
I don't have a very good signal. Excuse me.
what is it?
they got Tony and Michelle. Michelle is dead.
Tony is in critical condition. Now they're gonna kill me.
what are you talking about?
there's four people that know you're alive.
three of them are down. Jack, I'm the only one left.
this has to be about you.
it's the only thing the four of us have in common.
what happened to Tony tod Michelle.
there was a car bomb.
x There was a guy outside my apartment and he was chasing me.
Oh, my God.
where is he now?
I think I lost him.
I'm at a pay phone. I dumped my cell phone.
I don't know what to do now.
Chloe, you need to go dark.
that means zero contact with anyone.
even CTU? - Especially CTU.
whoever's behind this is probably monitori them.
someone out ther knows I'm still alive.
who?
I don't know, but that's what we need to find out.
right now, I want you to head north out of Los Angeles.
there's abandoned oil refinery at Variel and Topanga.
I want you to wait for me there
you can take cover by the large storage tanks at the north end of the field.
you're coming to L. A?
give me about a half an ho.
okay. Thanks.
Tony Almeida is being medevaced in.
we have a trauma team standing by to receive him in medical.
you're bringing him to CTU?
if there's a second attempt on his life, we can't protect him in a hospital.
this doesn't track.
Michelle and Tony have been inactive for over a year.
who'd want them dead?
whoever wanted Palmer dead.
so we're assuming they're connected.
the timing was too close to write it off as a coincidence.
there is a connection.
let's find it.
sir, the DOD liaison is here.
I need to set her up with the security protocols for the summit.
I'll take care of it.
you have your assignments.
send updates directly to my screen.
where is she?
she just cleared security.
must be hard for you to be back here.
thank you, Bill. I'm fine.
I'm sorry about Michelle.
Walt Cummings briefed me on the way over here.
he said that you wanted to postpone the signing of the treaty.
president Logan is making a mistake.
I don't disagree.
have you let him know that?
he's the President, Bill. It's his call.
that's what I'm afraid of.
he wants me to make sure that your top priority is still security for the summit.
station Five is set up for you.
when you're situated, we'll go over the revised security protocol.
great. Thank you, Bill.
david Palmer was a man of truth and of honor.
and his influence will be felt for generations to come.
our nation grieves for its loss.
Martha and I offer our deepest sympathy.
you look beautiful, Mrs. Logan.
I look like a wedding cake.
les start over.
Oh, you can get that.
is Mrs. Logan ready?
not quite.
you didn't tell her about David Palmer?
no. - Thank you.
she'll take it hard when she finds out.
they've been friends for a long time.
you don't have to talk about me like I'm not here.
excuse us, Evelyn.
I... I'm sorry.
look, I know... I know I'm late. I'm sorry.
I just... I'm having a bad hair day.
I've got som very bad news.
but... it's not Charles, is it?
no. No, he's fine.
he wanted to tell you himself...
well... what?
well, what... what is it?
david Palmer was assassinated.
no...
I'm sorry.
I know how close you were.
when did this happen?
less than an hour ago.
this morning?!
I...
I... I have to talk to Charles.
he's doing damage control, trying to keep this om pushing the treaty off the front page.
no, no, oh, no, I have to talk to him now.
no. He's doing a press conference... - No!
agent North!
call John, tell him not to let Mrs. Logan anywhere near the stage.
Yeah, give me Dr. Hill.
as I look back upon the deeds of David Palmer
not only one of this country's greatest leaders, but one of this world's greatest men...
Mrs. Logan... Let go of me.
let go of me! Let go! - I can't let you...
...to President Palmer's entire family.
would you get away from me?
and to them, I also pledge the full resources of this great nation to find and to punish those responsible.
no, no, no. Get aw from me.
I can't let you go out there. - Don't-don't touch me. Don't touch me.
get away from me now, or I swear
I will have your family eating dog food out of a can.
Martha, stop it!
Mike, damn it, I am the First Lady!
tell your storm trooper to stay away from me!
certainly.
I need to talk to my husband.
Martha, look... he's in the middle of a press conference right now.
hundreds of millions of people are watching him live.
...interfere with my job of making this country more secure.
what is it, Martha? What is so urgent?
...I have decided to keep my scheduled meeting with the Russian president
maybe I can help.
Yuri Suvarov and I will sign a comprehensive treaty that promises a new level of cooperation between us and our Russian friends in the war on terror.
tell Charles I want to see him when he's done.
all right
don't shoot me.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm sorry I followed you.
I'm just... I'm just worried about my mother.
get up.
get up. Get up!
damn it!
come here. You're going with me.
this is none of my business.
this is none of my business. I won't tell anyone.
just let me go, okay?
I really wish I could, kid but I can't.
you're going with me. Now get in the helicopter.
Frank, Frank, come on, please.
move!
prep a sterile cranial field.
I need access to the right hemisphere.
I need to talk to Tony before he goes into surgery.
he's non-responsive.
according to the paramedic on the chopper, he suffered a closed head trauma that's affected his speech.
they're going to try to insert a stint to relieve the pressure.
will he be able to talk then?
the doctor doesn't know.
I want real time updates on his progress.
we need Tony to explain this.
what is it?
I may have found a connection between Tony and David Palmer.
Tony's phone records?
one call in particular.
the last time Tony spoke to President Palmer was the day that Jack Bauer was killed.
pull the transcripts?
I tried, but the files were corrupted.
what's he hiding?
something about Jack's death.
are you kidnapping me?
No!
then where are you taking me?
Los Angeles.
Why?
because I couldn't leave you back there.
you'd have gone to the police, and I couldn't let that happen.
but what is this about?
who are you?
someone who's not supposed to still be alive.
like some kind of witness relocation thg?
Yeah, mething lith that.
so you were a criminal.
no. Listen, Dere the less you know about me, the better.
so what are you going to do with me?
Hello?
Diane, it's me.
Frank, I can just barely hear you. What's that noise?
I'm in a helicopter with Derek.
Yeah. He's fine.
listen, Diane, I need you to pick him up hiin Los Angeles for me.
why is he with you?
I'll explain everything as soon as I see you.
Frank, Frank, what are you doing with Derek?
Diane, please just do this for me.
I need you to get in a car a and start driving now.
you're scaring me.
Heane, do you remember this morning, when you said that you trusted me?
right now, I need you to trust me.
Derek's going to be fine. Just do what I say.
I need you to get in a car and start driving towards Los Angeles.
don't talk to anybody about this.
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
I don't understand.
you're just going to hand me back to my mom?
I thought you were worried about me going to the police.
I have something to do in Los Angeles.
once it's done, it doesn't matter.
how are you doing?
I'm sorry, Charles.
I didn't mean to make a scene.
I know that.
Dr. Hill says you haven't been taking your medication.
I don't like the way the pills make me feel.
we just need to get through today.
the reason that I needed to...
EDED to talk to you... - What is it, honey?
go ahead.
I think... that David was killed because of something he was about to tell me.
come on
what are you talkiou aal?
he called me yesterday.
he said he wanted to meet with me.
meet with you about what?
he said it concerned national security, and that it involved you.
me? - Yes.
what else did he say?
just that he would explain when he saw me.
if this was so important, why wouldn't he have called me himself?
well, Charles, you shut him out of this White House about 18 months ago.
you know that.
he had no real access.
except through you.
you don't believe me.
I didn't s that.
you didn't need to.
I am not making this up.
I am not crazy; I am not a fool it's going to be all right.
I'm not making this up.
all right.
I'll have Walt look into it.
you will?
Yes.
thank you.
but right now...
president Suvarov and his wife are arriving in one hour.
I need you to be there.
I need you by my side.
I'm sorry.
was she all right?
no, Walt, she's not all right.
she's having another one of her delusions.
she thinks that David Palmer was killed because of something he was about to tell her.
she's imagining she's in the middle of one of her own conspiracy theories.
well, what should we do?
nothing.
Spenser, have you talked to Chloe this morning?
no. Why?
she left her apartment about a half hour ago.
she should've been here by now.
it's probably traffic.
she commutes against traffic.
and she's not answering her cell phone.
I wouldn't worry about it.
she sounded strange when I talked to her.
she always sounds strange.
I'm gonna call Adamson, have him run a locate on her cell.
don't waste his time, Edgar. She's fine.
I'm sure of it. - What makes you so sure?
it doesn't matter. - It does to me.
I saw her, okay?
uh, about half an hour ago.
but I thought you said... - Forget what I said.
where did you see her? - Man...
do you really need me to spell it out for you?
don't worry about Chloe.
she's fine, all right?
you can just let me out here.
there's nothing here.
just pull over, please.
I still don't understand what this is all about, Frank.
will you please tell me what's going on?
please?
a friend of mine's in trouble.
I needed to pick her up in a hurry.
this is the only way I could get to her quick enough.
are you okay? - I'm fine!
what's happening?
why would anyone want to kill the people who know you're alive?
I don't know yet, but we're gonna find out.
right now, I need to get access to CTU's archives from a secure location
can you help me do that?
I can't do it from my laptop.
but there's a research loft at Cal Tech.
I can get us in.
who's that?
I'll explain as soon as we're in the car.
I don't have a car. I took a cab.
come on, get in the helicopter. We got to go.
Derek, get back in.
Jack? - What?
it's them.
how did theydiind me?
I don't think they ever lost you.
come on.
what's going on, Frank? Who are they?
what are we waiting for? Take off!
we're not at speed!
we're not gonna make it. Get out! Get out now, and stay by the side of the helicopter!
here! Take him and go into the refinery!
find somewhere to hide! Move!
I can't see anything
double back, cut him off.
go through the smoke screen; I'm going around.
go over here
hold your fire, Chloe!
Jack, what are you doing? Let's get out of here.
Chloe, take Derek and walk away.
walk away now!
at the rate you're bleeding out, you're not gonna make it unless you get medical attention.
you tell me what I want to know, and I will get you to a hospital, you understand me?
do you understand me?
Yeah.
four people knew I was alive.
this morning, you tried to take them out.
why ?
Palmer was my... primary target.
they only cared about Palmer.
the others were just a diversion...
...to set you up, maket look like you did it.
why'd they want to kill Palmer?
to keep him from talking.
they had to shut him up. - What'd he know?
I wasn't given that information.
only hired... to take out the principle.
you're the one that killed Palmer.
Yeah.
who's behind this?
I got my orders through a code of silence.
we never use names, you know that.
that's all I know.
take me to a hospital.
Yeah.
I'm reprogramming a CTU key car right now.
good.
our couriers are delivering the canisters to the targets.
they'll be in place soon.
when are you launching your attacks?
after you're done at CTU.
when these terrorists attack, you're going to need to maintain order.
I believe we should be thinking of a preemptive declaration of martial law.
in the greater Los Angeles area.
if CTU can't find this man, Bierko, we're gonna get hit!
why didn't you just tell me you were alive?
if you knew I was alive, you would have been at risk, and I had no choice.
I'm happy that you're alive-- I am, but I can't give you what you want right now.
Michelle's murder was part of a bigger plan.
to supply terrorists with Sentox nerve gas.
who's behind it?
whatever he's not telling us is important.
and he's willing to tolerate an inhuman amount of pain.
thousands of lives are at stake.
there is enough time for you to tell me what I need to know to stop this insanity, please!
I'm sorry, guy, but I can't tell you what you want to know.
this is Bauer.
we've been compromised!
someone used a stolen key card to access CTU less than an hour ago.
Freeze!
drop the gun!
bill, it's Jack.
I think he tried to deploy nerve gas throughout the building.
code six everybody out!
go, go!
seal all the rooms.
Oh, no.
my god.
the following takes place between 7: 00 p. m. and 8: 00 p. m.
all CTU personnel.
this facility has been contaminated with Sentox ⅤⅩ1 nerve gas.
repeat: This facility has been contaminated.
there are two safe zones on the main floor
the situation room and medical.
on the second floor, the safe zones are Mr. Buchanan's office and holding room four.
these areas will remain sealed, pending the arrival of the chemical response team.
if you are in any of these sealed areas, do not attempt to leave until the CRT clears the environment.
I'm on my way, but it could take 20 to 30 minutes to gather all the CRT personnel you'll need.
I understand, Curtis, but we need CRT here now!
this is a high priority.
get here as fast as you can.
all right, copy
I'll call you in a few minutes with updates, this is Bauer.
Jack, it's Bill.
I just talked to Curtis.
he's with the chemical response team.
they won't be able to get here for at least 30 minutes.
why not?
most of their units were sent to Tyler Memorial.
the rest are en route to high probability targets.
okay, we're going to keep working here.
our networks are still up, right?
Yeah, the phones are working, the computers are up.
I can coordinate with division from here.
what do you need where you are?
I need to know if Henderson still alive.
where is he?
agent Burke was transferring him over to the isolation clinic in medical.
I don't know if they made it before the barriers went down.
you can tell if you pull up a building grid.
what about CTU's chemical response plan?
gas masks are in the armory, atropine is in medical storage.
both areas are contaminated.
we can't get to them without being exposed to the gas.
bill, I'm going to have to get right back to you.
I know how difficult this is for you, right now, but there's nothing we can do for him.
I need you to come back to work.
well, at least tell me how to pull up a building grid.
I'll do it myself.
Jack, we can try to pull it up.
get started.
Chloe, CTU is immobile right now.
everything is going to go through comm.
that's you.
I need you back at work.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
no, I can't!
Yes, you can!
Mr. Bauer.
what?
I can help her.
I'm a clinical psychologist.
thank you.
my name is Dr. Landes.
now, he was a friend of yours.
what was his name?
I'd like you to turn away from Edgar and focus on me, please.
Chloe, you're in shock, and I'd like to help you through it.
the only thing I'm going to ask you to do is sit in this chair and collect your breath.
let's do that now.
just collect your breath, just for a second.
he was such a good guy.
I just treated him like crap all day.
this is my fault.
sir?
someone stole my key card and used it to get into the building.
it was missing, and I didn't say anything.
why not?
I thought they just stole my wallet for the money.
how could you not report it?
I was embarrassed.
I didn't want anyone to know I got beat up.
so we're all going to die, because you were embarrassed?
Mr. Almeida, what are you doing?
I want to know what's going on.
no, I can't allow that.
I'm not sitting in this damn bed while CTU is under attack
got it?
fine.
how long are we supposed to be sectioned off like this?
I haven't received any news.
Oh, my god.
Jack, we've got the building grid.
bill, it's Jack
the grid's up.
all right, check the isolation zones that have logged in.
you'll have survivors.
two zones have logged on in medical.
try them.
I'm going to keep this line open.
okay, hold on.
clinic.
Dr. Besson, it's Jack Bauer.
Jack, what's going on?
one of the terrorists infiltrated CTU and deployed a canister of Sentox nerve gas through the ventilation system.
that's why we needed to seal off as many rooms as possible.
I need to know if agent Burke got to medical with Henderson.
Yes, he did.
Henderson's here right now?
Tony, is that you?
Jack, how much longer are we going to be locked down?
right now, we're in standby
we're trying to figure out how to clean out the air supply.
Dr. Besson?
patch me a security feed over at medical.
Jack, I don't think this program is set out for that.
try a redirect.
all right.
Dr. Besson!
what are you doing?
move aside.
my god, he's got a gun.
patch me through to their intercom.
do it.
we'll be able to hear them, but they can't hear us yet.
you can't kill him.
he's got information we need.
he killed my wife!
Tony, please, don't kill him.
move aside, Rick!
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.
move it!
you remember me?
my name is Tony Almeida.
you killed my wife, Michelle Dessler, this morning.
he's going to kill him-- hurry!
Hurry!
she was my life, and you took her.
and now, I'm going to take yours.
I got it.
Tony, it's Jack.
I've got you on the security feed.
stay out of this, Jack!
Tony, please, just listen to me.
you can't do this.
I know how you feel right now.
I lost Terry the exact same way, to one of our own.
I know what it feels to be betrayed like this.
but, Tony, Henderson has information that can save thousands and thousands of lives.
and I know that doesn't make you feel better right now, but I know you, Tony.
I know you don't want to make this situation any worse than it is.
please?
please, just let us finish our interrogation.
hurry up.
agent Burke, please continue.
we have to get him talking.
he's our only lead to Bierko and the rest of the Sentox canisters.
tell me where to find Bierko.
where?
nowhere.
what is your computer password?
no.
I know no password.
agent Burke, can we increase the dose?
not without killing him.
okay, take a short break and then start again.
get back to me as soon as you've got anything.
Yes, sir.
how could CTU have been hit?
we're not sure, Mr. vice president.
are you telling me they didn't have any safeguards in place?
they had partial containment, but our early reports indicate that 40% of their personnel have been taken out
you mean they've been killed?
we're afraid so, sir.
CTU is protecting this city.
are you saying they're no longer capable of doing that?
I'm saying they've been seriously compromised, yes.
so what are we going to do, Ms. Hayes?
we've got terrorists with nerve gas canisters out there.
who is going to stop them?
Mr. President, I suggest an emergency restructuring.
meaning what?
meaning that the chemical response team will go in neutralize the nerve gas at CTU and I will take a team in there and personally manage the operation.
how soon can you do that?
within the hour.
fine. Do it.
Yes, sir.
all right, they're still somewhat operational. It's not a complete disaster.
Mr. President, it is.
I can see no other option right now but to impose martial law on the city of Los Angeles.
Hal, my advisors believe if the military takes over the streets and starts detaining people, it could create mayhem.
sir, it's only a matter of time before me canisters are released in public places and then you will have mayhem.
except without the soldiers you'll need to contain it.
so what do I tell the public?
that we've got nerve gas canisters all over the city, but we don't know where they are?!
no, no, you don't have to get into that.
tie it to that earlier incident at the airport.
I'm going to get resistance from all sides.
that's true, sir.
we may have to swallow some saltwater, but wouldn't it be worth it, if we can keep the people off the streets, safe from another public attack?
I don't know, Hal.
sir, consider this
if we clear the streets of everybody except the military, these terrorists won't be able to move as freely as they are right now.
we have to do whatever we can to stop the people behind this.
CTU is no longer an obstacle.
at least for the time being.
good.
have our men move from their current positions and go to the new target.
how much of the nerve gas will they release there?
all of it.
excuse me.
Chloe, are you ready to go back to work?
what do you need?
I need you. We can't break Henderson.
I need you to keep trying to decrypt the files that we took from his computer.
I already tried that. It didn't work. Maybe somebody else could do it.
Chloe, you're the only person in the room qualified.
Chloe, please. Don't shut down on me now.
I'm upset about everything that's happening too, but you know how things work around here.
we do not quit until it's over.
you're not helping her. You're just making things worse.
I am sure that you are qualified to help someone through this kind of distress over an extended period of time, but you see, we do not have an extended period of time.
so if you don't mind stepping aside so I can do my job, I would appreciate it.
believe it or not, Jack, you don't have to be qualified to help people.
you just have to be there for them.
like you were there for my daughter.
what does that mean?
you're 20 years older than she is.
I know exactly what you're doing.
I've done nothing but try and help her deal with her loss.
how dare you accuse me of taking advantage of her.
you did...
dad, stop! You can be angry at me all you want, but before I met Barry, I didn't want to live. Do you understand that?
fine, I'll get back to work if everyone could just relax.
Jack, we have a problem.
what?
Chloe, I just saw the alarm. What's going on?
the seal pressure indicators in the contaminated zones are showing traces of sublimated polymer near the partition seal.
what does that mean?
it means that the nerve gas must be mixed with a corrosive agent--an acid.
the acid's breaking down the seal between the rooms.
how long till the seal fails completely?
it's hard to say for sure.
can you give me an estimate?
it's deteriorating quickly. I'd say 15 minutes, 20 at the most.
and then what?
as soon as the gas permeates the seal, it enters the room. Then it's over.
get me schematics on all the isolated zones.
Mr. vice president, with all due respect,
I'm not trying to usurp your position.
I'm simply trying to serve the president the best way I can.
Yes, sir.
what was that about?
I was trying to convince Gardner to let me help him draft the president's statement.
Charles is letting Hal write his statement?!
he's insisted.
and the president gave him the go-ahead.
but that means Gardner is effectively making policy.
we've got to stop him.
I'm trying.
but you know what kind of pressure the president's under today.
he wants all the counsel he can get.
and Hal's only too eager to help out.
of course he's too eager. He's got his eye on the oval office.
anything he can do to speed up Charles' downfall puts him one step closer to the presidency
Martha, you have to intervene.
Hal feeds the president ideas.
we saw it at the WTO, we saw it in Chicago. When they work, Hal takes the credit for them. When they don't, the president takes the hits.
have you reminded Charles of that?
I can't. Hal's the vice president.
I'm just the chief of staff.
you have influence that supercedes any constitutional rank.
and now's the time to use it.
I want to see the statement as soon as it's issued.
you will.
I just checked the readings from all uncontaminated zones.
the testing you've been doing in your respective areas is consistent.
the Sentox nerve gas that was released into the air duct system contains a corrosive agent that is eating away at the barrier seals protecting the safe zones.
I'm not going to pull any punches.
CRT will not be here to help us.
at this point, our only hope is to help ourselves.
we need to find a way to either neutralize or flush the Sentox out of the contaminated areas before the barrier seals fail and the gas enters the safe zones.
I want all personnel working on this problem.
we don't have much time. Do what you can.
we'll hope for the best.
maybe we can do something from in here.
access the ventilation system?
even if I could, it doesn't mean we could do anything to stop the seals from breaking down.
just try.
maybe it's not as bad as we think. Maybe the numbers are off.
they're not.
even if the seals leak, CRT could get here in time.
the only reason she's here is because I asked her to stay.
if something happens to her, it's going to be because of me. Because of what I did.
there was no way that you could know that CTU was vulnerable.
you've got something?
I think if I can slow the seals from breaking down
I can flush the contaminated areas using the air conditioning.
do it.
something's wrong. The control isn't responding.
why not?
it's being blocked by some program that I can't get to remotely.
it's probably on a computer near holding four.
can you get me in there?
this is a false wall. The air in there is not contaminated.
can he get to the computer through there?
Yes, but once he makes it through the safe zone, he'll be in a contaminated area.
what are you talking about? He can't go through a contaminated area.
I can hold my breath.
the Sentox won't be absorbed by my skin over that short a period of time.
as long as I don't inhale it, I'll be fine.
Jack, you can't hold your breath that long.
I only have to hold my breath long enough to get to the computer, disconnect the program and get back to the ventilated room.
once I'm back in the safe room, how long will it take you to clear out the Sentox?
about 20 seconds based on the cubic footage.
Jack, even if you get to the computer, what if we can't ventilate that room?
Chloe thinks we can.
right now, this is our only option. CRT is not going to get here in time.
the seals are now 80% gone.
what's the bottom line?
we have less than 20 minutes.
all right, Jack, Chloe and I are on channel one.
if you need to communicate with anyone else we'll patch you through.
as soon as I go through, you have to replace this behind me.
Jack, it's time. Go now.
now.
Chloe, it's Jack.
I just completed the airlock.
I'm getting ready to move into the ventilation room.
I'll tap my com unit three times when I'm back in the safe room.
all right.
Jack, I don't have to remind you if that airlock leaks, we'll all be dead within the next three minutes.
it's not going to leak, Chloe.
okay...
I'm going in. - Okay.
seal corrosion is now at 86 percent.
is there anything we can do from here?
no, we just have to wait.
there's nothing we can do to get your dad out any faster.
don't talk down to me, Chloe.
listen, we're in a crisis situation here, okay?
tempers are bound to flare. Let's just everybody breathe.
what's with you and the breathing? Is that your solution to everything?
it's Jack, he's back in the room.
it's too soon, he couldn't have found the program and disabled it yet.
he's got 15 more seconds before the room clears.
what's it mean that he finished so quickly?
I don't know.
well, it could be a good thing, right?
it could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing.
that's what "I don't know" means.
all right, Jack, the room is clear, you can breathe. Are you okay?
I couldn't get to it.
Chloe, you're right. I saw it.
there's a computer program running on the ac control unit, but there's a security grate in the wall behind the vent.
I don't see it on my system.
trust me, it's there.
I just found it.
it was a security upgrade in the last two years.
somebody don't file it properly, that's why I didn't see it.
are there any other vents that could help us get into that wall?
no, they've all been upgraded.
well, it's a room, there's got to be a door. Where does it lead?
to a corridor above holding four.
none of us can get there from where we're at.
who's in holding room four?
are there any other vented rooms we can get him to?
no, Jack, there's nothing.
patch me through to him.
mcgill here.
Lynn, it's Jack.
we found a computer interrupt in the ac control unit.
now if we can shut that down in the next few minutes, we can stop the gas from permeating the safe zones.
well, that's good news.
the problem is you're the only person close enough to get to it.
it's directly above the holding room where you are now.
take the stairs, go to the left around the corner. It's the room on your left.
okay...
how are we going to do this, Jack?
Lynn, the truth is if I can get there,
I would do this myself, but I'm not close enough.
no one who's still alive in CTU is. You're the only person who can do this.
and I'm going to have to ask you to do it without any protection.
I see.
no, you don't.
as soon as you open the door to the hallway, your room will become contaminated.
you can hold your breath long enough to fix the problem, but we have nowhere else to send you.
we can't airlock you.
there are two of us in here, Jack.
sir, this is Harry Swinton.
so you're saying that if he does this, then we're both going to die?
I'm so sorry.
we don't have a choice, Harry.
how do we know that you're not just making this story up so you don't have to make the sacrifice yourself?
you don't.
all I can ask you to do is believe me. I'm telling you the truth.
well, that's easy for you to say, sir. You're not the one who's about to die.
it's not easy for me to say.
hold on.
we have to do this, Harry.
we're going to die anyway.
if we don't, so will everyone in CTU.
we have to do this.
okay, Jack, go ahead.
once you enter the ventilation room, the computer will be on your right.
there's a program running on the computer.
you need to quit out of it, I'll take it from there.
Lynn, we don't have a lot of time.
I'll do it.
I'm sorry about how I acted earlier...
and about your friend that died.
okay. Thanks.
I've been wanting to ask you something.
did you have contact with my dad while he was gone?
I sent him information about once a month.
what kind of information?
a lot of different things.
about me?
actually, almost all of it was about you.
your breakup with Chase, your depression...
Wha...? How did you get...?
I'm really good at getting information.
I don't judge it, I just pass it on.
I'm sorry about you and Chase. It must've been really painful.
Yeah, it was.
so you talked to him, too?
chase? No.
you know where he is?
no, but I could find out, if you want.
no, no, it's all right.
Barry thinks I should let that go.
he's probably right.
Yeah, well, shrinks are always giving advice that they probably don't follow themselves.
how are you doing?
well, this morning woke up with a guy in my bed that I'll probably never see again.
and I just watched one of my best friends die right in front of me, so... I guess not that great.
Yeah.
replace the panel.
pull up the security feed for the observation room.
you be a good girl for mommy, okay?
she tells you you have to go to bed, you have to go to bed.
when you coming home?
I don't know, honey.
if I fall asleep, will you wake me up?
of course I will.
yeah? - Yeah.
I'm going in now, Harry.
good bye
I love you.
love you, to dad.
bye baby Chloe, we're ready.
I'm going in.
okay, good luck. And thanks for doing this.
Yeah.
he did it.
is the ac responding?
Yes. I'm starting the fans now.
how long before the Sentox is neutralized?
at least 15 minutes, but the concentration should go down enough to stop eating away at the seals immediately.
polymer count is down it looks like the seals will hold until all zones are clear.
Lynn, Harry, I don't know if you can still hear me, but I want you to know what you did was successful.
the seals are holding.
I will personally notify your families and tell them of the sacrifice you made.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
thank you.
I'm okay...
I'm okay.
Oh, my god.
pull up the security feed to medical.
can you hear me?
what's your name?
no...
no name.
you're wasting your time.
agent Burke, this is Jack Bauer.
what have you got from Henderson?
nothing. He's still not talking.
okay, keep working on him.
as soon as the barriers go up, I'll get back to you.
I don't think we're going to break Henderson now.
all the information that we're going to get is from his computer.
I need you to keep working on those files.
most of my team is gone. How am I going to do that?
only work on his files.
as soon as the barriers go up, I want you go over to medical and let them check you out.
no, dad, when the barriers go up, I'm leaving.
Kim, please, just do this for me.
we still need to talk.
there's nothing to talk about.
don't be in such a hurry to cut me off.
you cut me off.
listen to me, I'm not angry.
I love you.
but there's nothing left to say except I don't want to be around you.
every time I am, something horrible happens. People die, and I know that's not your fault, but I can't be a part of it.
I don't want you to be a part of that.
all I want is for one day you and i just to be able to spend time together.
Kim, I had to give you up once, I'm not going to let that happen again.
dad...
I can't.
Hi. - Hey.
God, that was close. - I know.
are you all right?
no.
an emergency peacekeeping force.
it was Hal's suggestion.
I think it works.
aren't you afraid that an edict of this kind could do far more damage than any chemical weapon ever could?
Martha, CTU has been attacked.
our first line of defense is shut down and people were killed because of this chemical weapon.
and that's just a prelude to what's going to happen in this city more nerve gas will be released, I can guarantee it.
look, if your mike-- you have any better ideas-- please,
I would be glad to hear them.
- Sorry
what is it, Martha?
if you, Charles Logan, really feel that martial law is your only option,
I will support you.
but what I will not do is stand by and watch Hal Gardner use you to promote his own agenda.
please, Martha, give me some credit.
he has done it before.
he is not the president.
you are.
I am doing this because it's the right thing to do!
I don't know how much more of this I can take
I real don't.
David's assassination, the nerve gas, the murder of those hostages, Cummings' betrayal, and you...
I almost lost you.
I didn't lose you, did I?
no, Charles.
you didn't lose me.
I'm still here.
Yes.
good.
the men are there. They need the schematics.
who is it?
just a client.
hello.
have you got it yet?
I told you I'd call you as soon as I have everything.
I'm still waiting on a few items.
I'm paying you a lot of money, Collette.
and if you could have gotten the detailed specs of a facility this secure from someone else, you would have.
but you didn't.
you called me and I'll have it for you in a few minutes.
what's wrong?
nothing.
difficult client.
wish I knew exactly what it is you did.
I might be able to help.
you do help me.
Oh, I can't.
I have to go and finish something.
finish this.
how long till the air will be safe to breathe?
all right, thank you very much.
Mr. Buchanan, this is Karen Hayes from homeland security.
I'm running a damage assessment and I need your body count.
we don't have a body count yet.
we'll know more when CRT gets here and the barriers lift.
what's your best estimate?
I'm guessing we'll need at least 20 in command and 35 in tactical and other departments.
all right, well, I'm on my way over there with a core team.
we can make adjustments when I get there.
you coming here now?
Yes.
I see.
I'll be there soon.
how's your progress?
good.
I've already reformatted their main servers to our specs.
all their tactical protocols will have to go through me.
good.
I may have to replace some of their personnel with my people.
do you have a problem with that?
absolutely not.
after what these people have been through, most of them won't be up to full capacity.
we need to identify these people quickly and send them home.
what about chain of command?
am I going to need approval from Bill Buchanan if I want to make a personnel change?
no, Bill won't be in charge when we get there,
I will.
for all intents and purposes, CTU is no longer an operation entity.
it's a building with workers who will report to us.
we're clear. I'm going back to medical.
I have to finish this now.
I know. Good-bye, dad.
good-bye excuse me, Jack.
I just wanted to say thank you for saving our lives.
I mean, we definitely couldn't have gotten through this without you.
take her outside of the city.
don't make any stops. You understand?
looks like he's dead.
no.
his nervous system is shut down.
well, can you wake him up?
no.
Tony, it's Jack. I'm on my way.
Yeah, Jack, Henderson's in a coma. He's not coming out of it.
you've had your chance. He's mine now.
damn it, Tony, just wait until I get there!
no, I'm done waiting.
you don't want to do this. It's not going to bring back Michelle.
no,
no, but I'll feel better.
trust me, it won't.
you're probably right. I'll let you know.
What'd Jack say?
he's on his way here.
we'll figure out what to do when he gets here.
there's nothing to figure out.
this guy's cooked.
I-I couldn't do it.
it's all right. It's all right. Come on.
you stay with me. Stay with me.
I need help!
somebody help!
no, no...
no, hang on.
hang on!
she's gone, Jack.
Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.
the recording of the phone call that you made between president Logan and Henderson is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?
city Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills.
Jack knows there's no point in going public till he has that evidence in his hand.
none of this should have happened.
this whole thing was planned to make our country safer.
and it all spiraled out of control when you decided to kill David Palmer.
we have to focus on stopping Bauer before he finds that recording.
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the immediate apprehension and arrest of Jack Bauer.
I want you to run point on this and I want you to make this CTU's top priority.
understood, sir.
you know, if we really want to find Bauer, we need to keep watch on anyone he might contact for help, starting with Audrey Raines.
don't fill your father in on the particulars.
just set up the meeting.
I'll get back to you as soon as I have the recording.
I need to see you in person.
can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?
all right, yes.
I'll see you there.
Jack, are you aware president Logan's issued a warrant for your arrest?
the vice president's not the one who's behind this, is he?
no. It's Logan.
as soon as we have the evidence in hand, we're going to pass it off to secretary of defense Heller.
it had to be done, sir.
I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson.
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.
you know what we need.
the instant that Bauer steps outside that bank building, you take him down.
kill the others and secure the recording.
we got the evidence.
have you listened to it?
Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan.
we're talking about taking down the president of the United States.
the following takes place between 12: 00 a. m. and 1: 00 a. m.
this checkpoint is just one of many that have been in place for several hours now.
despite his announcement that Los Angeles is no longer under threat of attack, president Logan has ordered that martial law remain in effect.
while the move has drawn criticism from lawmakers and civil rights advocates, the president is defending his decision as a necessary precaution.
he's citing the need...
Yes. - It's me.
is Bauer dead?
not yet, Mr. President.
you said your men had him.
Bauer triggered the bank alarm.
the authorities came before our men could get to him.
Bauer used the cover of the firefight to slip away.
he has the recording?
Yes, sir.
that evidence directly implicates me in David Palmer's death.
only if he gets it to someone who can do something about it.
we'll have Bauer before that happens.
how?
Mr. President, you've established direct control over CTU, and CTU is heading up the search effort for Bauer.
you're putting an awful lot of faith in their ability.
this city is locked down.
CTU will find Bauer, and when they do, make sure you're the first to know. So my men can intercept.
Yes, Mr. President?
Karen Hayes at CTU. Put it through to my office.
we're sifting satellite and Caltrans video for Audrey Raines's vehicle.
I've distributed her file photo to military checkpoints throughout the city.
if she used her DoD credentials at any of them, there should be a record.
well, I hope we're not wasting our resources on Raines when we don't even know she's helping Bauer.
Karen, she dumped the tracker.
there's a reason she doesn't want to be followed.
miss Hayes, the president's on line one.
Yes, Mr. President.
where are we, Ms. Hayes?
still running active manhunts on both Jack Bauer and Christopher Henderson.
I told you to prioritize Bauer.
I have, sir. I've allocated my resources accordingly.
if David Palmer's killer is still at large when the morning news cycle begins, then all the success we've had handling these terrorists will be undermined.
I will find Bauer, sir.
you let me know the moment you do.
Yes, Mr. President.
Bauer, right?
she knows where he is, and those protocols aren't going to be enough to track her.
you still think Chloe helped Audrey break surveillance?
I'm sure of it.
remember, Audrey insisted Chloe be assigned to her.
then we need to confront Chloe.
no, no, no, no, no. She'll just deny it.
there's a way we can use her to find Bauer.
it's all right. It's him.
bill, over here.
sorry about your brother.
what the hell's going on, Jack?
the military authority, every law enforcement agency across this country has a warrant for my arrest.
what for?
killing David Palmer.
that's impossible. We cleared you this morning.
I'm being set up again, this time by president Logan.
he was complicit in David Palmer's assassination.
my god, you're serious.
Logan's using the military to try and stop me from exposing him.
Mr. Buchanan, we have the evidence:
a digital recording of a conversation made between president Logan and Christopher Henderson.
I need to get the recording to secretary Heller.
he's gonna take it to the attorney general, and they'll file for the warrant.
but until then, Wayne's a target.
I need you to take him somewhere safe.
of course I will.
where are you gonna meet Heller?
van Nuys Airport.
Yeah.
Jack, my father landed. Where are you?
I just dropped Wayne Palmer off with Buchanan.
I'm on my way to the airport now.
all right, I'm on the north side of the emergency runway at hangar 112.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
all right, hurry.
dad.
Hi, sweetheart. - Hi.
thank you so much for doing this.
well, I don't know what it is I'm doing, so don't thank me yet.
these men in your security detail, do you trust them?
with my life.
dad, I need to be sure that they are loyal to you.
what's going on?
dad, I will tell you, but only you.
stay here.
you know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
tell me what this is all about.
I promise, I will.
I just need a minute.
Mr. Secretary.
what the hell are you doing here?
he's a fugitive.
every law enforcement agency in this state is looking for him.
he's innocent.
then why don't you turn yourself in?
Mr. Secretary, I swear to you,
I had nothing to do with David Palmer's assassination.
I'd like to believe you, Jack, but you're acting like a criminal.
I don't have a choice; they're setting me up.
Mr. Secretary, I only need you for a few minutes.
I need to show you something, but privately, inside the building, please.
thank you, sir.
it had to be done, sir.
I decide what needs to be done, Mr. Henderson.
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.
Palmer was nosing around. - President Logan?
and a man named Christopher Henderson.
he'd have found out about your involvement.
for god's sake, sir, he called your wife.
I can handle my wife.
right now, my concern is keeping this operation from collapsing like a house of cards.
you're protected, sir.
every thread ends with Cummings.
he thinks he's running this, and you need to keep playing it that way.
I know my part, Mr. Henderson.
you just do as you're told.
president Logan supplied the terrorists with the Sentox nerve gas.
what?
his plan was to deploy the nerve gas en route to Moscow.
that way, he could expose the terrorists and use them as an excuse to invoke the military terms of the agreement that he made earlier with Suvarov.
this was all in an effort to gain control of the oil supply in Central Asia.
david Palmer found out about it, and that's why they killed him.
how do you know that recording hasn't been fabricated?
I trust the source.
Mr. Secretary, I promise you, this will stand up under scrutiny.
I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not.
I watched Charles Logan rise on the tide of his own ambition.
I was terrified when he took the oath.
sir, I'm very sorry that I had to involve you, but I needed someone who had access to hand-deliver this to the attorney general.
so you contacted me.
you're the only one I could trust.
all right, then.
thank you, sir.
you need to go with your father.
he's going to need someone to corroborate the evidence to the attorney general.
what about you?
I'm going to go dark until the attorney general comes forward.
I'll call Buchanan; I'll let him know what's happening.
all right. Jack, everything's going to be okay now.
Yeah. Go.
Jack, one more thing.
what, sir?
dad, what are you doing?! - Secure my daughter.
you're playing a dangerous game here, Jack, and you're playing it wrong.
turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle will not bring back David Palmer.
it'll tear this nation apart.
you're not only destroying the president, you'll be destroying the presidency.
the collateral damage of the truth will cripple this nation.
so what are you going to do? Bury the evidence?
no.
you're coming with me, Audrey, and we'll use the evidence to get Logan to step down quietly.
once he's gone, we'll have a chance to set things right again.
Doug, I'm trusting you to keep this item safe.
Audrey, are you coming with me or not?
dad, I can't.
then secure them both until you hear from me.
dad, please, no!
Mr. Secretary, you can't make a deal with him!
you can't trust him!
excuse me.
do you know what's going on in the situation room?
it's some sort of briefing.
no one told me.
it's a class 3. That's all I know.
I'm a department head. I should be in all class 3s.
that's all I know.
shari, what was that briefing about?
just a protocol review.
I don't believe you. - Why not?
cause you're a bad liar.
miles just gave me a bunch of busywork to do in the archives room to keep me out of the briefing.
do you ever think there might be a reason he kept you out?
he thinks I helped Audrey break her surveillance.
is that what it was about?
I've already said too much.
please don't ask me any more questions.
come on, Shari, you owe me. I stuck my neck out for you with Miles.
tell me what happened in there.
miles found Audrey. He activated a transponder on her car.
so they know where she is?
we're running an operational support right now.
that's what the briefing was about.
they sent a TAC team ten minutes ago.
please don't tell anyone I said anything.
here she comes.
damn, she's good.
she set up a proprietary com channel.
how long will it take to track her call?
not long.
pick up.
somewhere in the valley.
looks like a pay phone.
I've got the receiving end narrowed down to a one-mile radius.
why isn't Audrey picking up?
Narrowing...
got it. - Where?
van Nuys Airport--the emergency runway adjacent to the main field.
move the TAC team out now.
van Nuys Airport. Miles is forwarding the coordinates.
get me the president.
you said they sent the TAC team ten minutes ago.
miles set me up, and you helped.
you're working against us, Chloe.
you have no idea what you've done.
miles said that... - Miles is an idiot.
if anyone should know that, it should be you.
I can't believe you went along with him.
please come with us, Ms. O'Brian.
where are we going? - Let's go.
Mr. President, I need to remind you that we still don't have confirmation that Audrey Raines and Bauer are at the location.
you'll find out soon enough.
I'll have the military authority follow up on it.
the military? Sir, I just dispatched my TAC team.
call them back.
I don't understand...
Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem.
there are political ramifications.
I've decided to handle him directly.
and besides, you must have your hands full, transitioning CTU to homeland security.
I'll recall my team, sir.
good.
now the president wants oversight on the Bauer operation.
he's the president. He can do what he wants.
Yeah.
CTU thinks they found Bauer.
where?
Jack, what if my father's right?
what if he can get Logan to step down quietly?
maybe that is the best thing for this country.
these people brokered chemical weapons to terrorists.
they've killed an ex-president of the United States.
Logan's not going to make a deal with your father, and even if he did, he wouldn't keep it.
Henderson wouldn't let him.
the only thing your father's doing right now is making himself a target.
you want to help him?
help me get the recording back before he speaks to Logan.
look, Mike, this isn't me being territorial, but if the president wants Jack Bauer, why doesn't he let us take care of it?
now, look, I've been on other things.
let me find out what's going on.
I'll get back to you, Karen.
thank you, Mike.
...will be lifted within the next two hours, but the curfew will remain in effect...
come in.
that's only six hours from now.
okay.
david Palmer's body's being flown back to D.C. at 7: 00 a. m.
the president and I both want to be there when the coffin's put onto the plane.
that's a good idea. - Yeah.
what's up, Mike?
I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU.
do you know about the president's decision to pull them off the acquisition of Jack Bauer?
no, but what's the problem?
the problem is it doesn't really make sense.
Karen's teams are closer. They can do it more efficiently.
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them than with a group of military police he doesn't know.
well, Karen and her team have barely gotten CTU back on its feet.
I'm sure the president just feels more confident with the military units already in place because of martial law.
well, the military has its hands full, Hal.
what do you want me to say, Mike?
it's the president's call.
I can see it both ways.
yeah?
operations.
Beth, it's Mike Novick. Put me through to general Warren, please.
Yes, sir.
this is Warren.
sir, I have Mike Novick on the line for you.
go ahead, Beth.
he's on.
what is it, Mike?
general, can you give me an update on your search for Jack Bauer?
what are you talking about?
the one the president ordered.
we never received such a call from the president.
I see.
I-I'm sorry to disturb you, general.
you should try to get some rest, Mr. President.
Yes, I know. I should try to get some rest.
what is it you want, Mike?
I just got off the phone with general Warren, who's running military operations here in Los Angeles.
why would you be talking with him?
Karen Hayes over at homeland raised a few good points I thought I'd follow up on.
what good points, Mike?
she doesn't understand why she was taken out of the loop on this Jack Bauer situation.
you know, I really don't care what Karen Hayes understands.
she should be doing her job and not bothering my advisors, asking questions that diminish my authority.
be that as it may, I did follow up, and, now, frankly,
I'm a little mystified by some things.
what things mystify you, Mike?
well, you told homeland that you wanted the military to pick up Jack Bauer, but I just spoke with general Warren, and he's unaware of any such directive.
because I didn't go through general Warren.
may I ask who you did go through?
Mike, let's get one thing straight:
I don't answer to you.
of course not, sir.
however, I will tell you this:
I-I have decided to use a covert task force to bring in Jack Bauer.
the reason I'm doing that is because Bauer presents...
special circumstances.
special circumstances?
I want this completely off the radar, Mike.
the Chinese government may still believe that Jack Bauer is dead.
if they find out that he's alive, they're going to blame us.
they're going to, uh, accuse us of fabricating the story of his death.
wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller if we let Karen handle this?
her people already know about Bauer.
they're working under a secretive mandate.
you know what, Mike? I am tired of being second-guessed.
I've been dealing with-with-with... wall-to-wall crises for the last 18 hours, and I think I've done a pretty damn good job of leading the country.
of course, Mr. President.
you came in here suggesting that I should get some rest.
that's the one recommendation of yours that I intend to take.
thank you, Mike.
we traced your call to a public phone at Van Nuys Airport.
if Audrey Raines is at that location, you're in a lot of trouble.
miles, this situation is more complicated than you think.
you have no idea what you're dealing with. --But you do.
Yes. -Then why didn't you tell me?
because I can't.
you think the rules don't apply to you because you're smarter than the rest of us, but I have news for you. They do, and you're not.
I won't miss you when you're gone.
don't touch me.
what?
Jack Bauer did not kill president Palmer.
he's a federal fugitive wanted for the murder of a former president, which means you're going to jail, O'Brian.
for a long time.
I don't think you're as big of a jerk as you pretend to be.
I need to speak to you. - Yes, sir.
what are you doing, Chloe?
you're supposed to be in custody.
miles let me out.
you're a worse liar than I am.
shari, don't do that.
you helped Audrey Raines break surveillance.
Yes, I did it for a good reason. I can't get into it right now.
well, I don't really think you have a choice.
listen to me for a minute.
Jack Bauer did not kill president Palmer. He knows who did it.
he may need my help to prove it and I can't help him if I'm in custody.
then why don't you just tell Karen?
because she won't believe me. Nobody will, not without evidence.
it's president Logan.
what are you talking about?
the evidence Jack is trying to get implicates Logan in the assassination of Palmer.
that's ridiculous, Chloe.
you know your sexual harassment charges against Miles? I know you were lying.
you're sick and you need help, and if you try to stop me and it turns out I'm right about Jack, and I am,
I will recommend you for a psychiatric evaluation.
and you won't like that, trust me.
Charles. You coming to bed soon?
I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight.
you should try.
you okay? - I'm fine.
it's just, uh...it's been a challenging day.
okay.
come to bed.
I will. Soon.
yes?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. President, but secretary Heller is on the line.
he insists on talking to you.
tell him I'll call him back tomorrow.
he says it's urgent, sir.
put him through.
Yes, James.
thanks for taking my call, Mr. President.
you said it was urgent.
I need to see you, sir.
see me about what?
I'd rather speak to you in person.
fine, but I won't be back to Washington for a couple of days.
I'm in L. A., Sir.
I need to see you tonight.
tonight? What is this about?
I'll be there shortly and we can discuss it then.
I don't like your tone, James.
in case you've forgotten, you're addressing the president of the United States.
I know who I'm addressing.
and I think you know exactly what this is about.
when will you be here?
five minutes. -Fine.
James Heller? What does he want?
he's getting flak from the joint chiefs about my decision to maintain martial law.
you would think that these people would show some allegiance.
can't James handle it himself?
apparently not.
come to bed when you're done. -I will.
where are you?
we're leaving now.
how long will it take you to get there? -Ten minutes.
we may not have that much time.
James Heller is on his way here. He insisted on seeing me right away.
Jack got to him.
what if Bauer's given him the recording?
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with him, and without it, whatever he knows or whatever he thinks he knows won't matter.
you think Bauer still has it?
I'm sure of it.
I'll hold Heller off as long as I can, --but you phone me the second you have the evidence in hand. --Right.
Mrs. Logan.
what is secretary Heller doing here?
I don't know, ma'am.
but you have an idea.
my husband says it's about his order to maintain martial law, but I think it's something else.
if you know what it is, will you please tell me?
I can't.
you can't? Or you won't?
please don't ask me anything more, Mrs. Logan.
whatever you tell me will remain between the two of us. I promise you.
Aaron...you can trust me. You know that.
not here.
meet me in a couple minutes. -Where?
outside the south stable.
thank you, gentlemen.
I hope this was important.
I know what you did. I know what you're doing.
and I'm here to put an end to it.
you have to be a little more specific.
you are responsible for the murder of David Palmer.
that's outrageous.
I heard a recording
a conversation between you and man named Christopher Henderson.
when Palmer found out about your insane plan, Henderson had him killed.
and you let it happen.
where is this recording?
it's in a safe place.
I would like to hear it.
Why? You know exactly what you said, and so do I.
it's burnt into my memory.
how dare you stand there and judge me?
you have no idea.
until you sit in my chair, you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
your chair is not a throne, Charles.
I'm protecting the interests of our country. --You mean oil.
Yes. Yes! This country needs energy more than you or anybody in this gridlocked government cares to admit.
we'll see how you judge me when the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel and the people who put me in office can't afford to heat their homes or run their cars.
and you think that justifies the blood on your hands?
what do you want?
I want you to drop the trumped-up charges against Jack Bauer.
and leave my daughter alone.
anything else?
announce your resignation by tomorrow morning.
blame it on the crushing stress of today's events, or blame it on whatever you want, just as long as you go public by the start of the morning news cycle.
and then what?
the recording will be kept under lock and key, and this will remain between us.
call in vice president Gardner.
I want to be here when you hand him your letter of resignation.
get in here.
I haven't been able to contact Jack or Audrey. --I haven't talked to them either.
CTU might have them in custody.
I need to tap into their current protocols.
Where's your workstation? -This way.
homeland changed my access code.
I can create a workaround.
if CTU has Jack, it's all my fault.
I can get us out of here.
watch the door.
he's got restraints in his pocket. Secure him.
Wexler, status report.
mark, come in.
don't move.
don't... move. Slowly put the gun on the ground and kick it towards me.
do it!
put your hands where I can see them.
give me the recording. Slowly.
stand up.
what did you do to my partner?
he's fine.
son of a bitch!
take cover behind the wheel! Now! Move! Move!
what the hell's going on?!
they've come for the recording!
if you and I are gonna get through this alive, we need to work together.
give me my gun!
I have her, Jack. Now don't make me kill her.
there's been too much killing today already, so just throw out that recording.
let her go, Christopher.
after I have the recording.
why are you doing this? Why are you protecting Logan?
I'm protecting something much more important than Charles Logan.
what?
the integrity of our government.
our government has no integrity.
not when someone like Charles Logan occupies the presidency.
Christopher, you can make this right. You can help me stop him.
sorry, Jack. Now throw me the recording.
I'll give you the recording if you let Audrey go.
I wish I could believe that.
I give you my word.
I'll tell you what.
I'll meet you halfway.
what does that mean?
damn it, Christopher!
here she comes, Jack. Walk out slow, or I'll kill you.
that's far enough, Ms. Raines.
what have you done to her?
the left brachial artery.
she has about three minutes before she bleeds to death. Now throw me that recording.
Jack, don't.
she's 15 seconds closer to dying, Jack. Give me the recording.
Jack, don't do it.
she's running out of time.
don't do it, Jack. Don't. Don't give it to him.
here it is!
easy, easy, easy. Easy. Stay with me. Stay with me.
Jack, go get him. Go get him. Go.
stay with me.
I'll be right back.
give me your arm.
I need to move you. Come on.
all it needs is your signature, Mr. President.
James, we can find another way to handle this.
there must be something I can give you, something that you want.
you're giving me exactly what I want.
you asked to see me, Mr. President?
Hi, Jim.
I thought you'd be on a plane back to Washington.
what are you doing here?
I'll let president Logan tell you.
Mr. President.
Yes.
I have the recording.
Really?
I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle.
thank you.
I'm asking secretary Heller to tender his resignation. I wanted you here as a witness.
What?!
he came here to accuse me of being complicit in today's terrorist attacks.
I don't know how he can make such an accusation without any evidence.
he orchestrated a conspiracy to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas.
that's insane, James.
he sanctioned the assassination of David Palmer! And I have the evidence.
where? Show it to us.
who was on the phone? Who made that call?
I want your resignation on my desk by the morning.
if any harm comes to my daughter...gentlemen!
please escort secretary Heller out of my home.
I wonder what reservation they let him off of?
my truck's overheating.
it's 30 miles to the next station. I need some water.
maybe you should've stolen a better truck. Tonto.
you've got a big mouth. Convict. - He's only joking. Chief.
could i have some water? - You mean firewater. Tonto?
Jesus christ. Hold it!
he's a state prisoner. You asshole.
knock it off.
hold it. You asshole.
get out of the way.
don't move. Convict.
apo 657. unit 25 to apo 478.

they're armed and dangerous. Get here. Quick.
escape in progress. One indian and prisoner albert ganz.
if we slept over at your place. You could put on a clean shirt.
what makes you think i've got any clean shirts at my place?
great morning.
I want her young. Tall. Thin. Real thin.
she's got to have nice legs.
I don't like jeans. Jeans are cheap.
a dress. A nice summer dress. No. I know you don't get it.
what about me? - I need one more for my friend.
make her an indian. No. Not with a turban.
a squaw.
it'll be the walden hotel. Near broadway.
ask for... g p polson.
just be a couple of hours. Right.
that's a crummy breakfast. - I've got a crummy day ahead of me.
what are you talking about? - Jack. I hate that attitude.
what difference does it make? I make you feel good.
what do you want from a guy? - You make me mad.
I don't have time for this. I've got to go to work.
you really are hopeless. - That's what i always say.
call me later. - You want me to? Good.
thanks for the coffee. - Here. Take this.
you know what the man said:
the coldest winter i ever spent. Was the summer i was in san francisco.
we aren't going by the store again. We need to save a little bit.
I liked that carpet. - We can't afford it.
I know we can't afford it. But i'd like it.
you want me to go out and steal for the money?
surprise. Luther. - You were locked up.
I want the money that reggie hid. - What are you talking about?
you want that indian to snap her neck?
we were partners. - Billy. Break it.
no. I'll get you the money. But i can't get it till monday.
honest. The place we've got it stashed is closed.
monday morning is when it opens. I'll get the money right to you.
I always liked you. Luther. You were fun to hang out with.
we're going to keep her. - Trust me.
if you mess with us. I'll put holes in her you never even thought of.
ganz. Please. - Don't fuck up.
Rosie!
Hey. Algren. Need any back up? - No. You make me nervous.
your wife makes you nervous. The radio said you had something on.
a guy named polson had his credit cards lifted.
one of polson's cards rented that green coupe over there.
it's just a laugher?
it was a kid with a switchblade.
well. You guys are experts. - We don't need any big artillery.
I'm just trying to help out. I love to watch pros work.
I don't need your help. - You can come in.
stake out the lobby. How's the car running?
how's the wife? - Mean as a snake.
you guys were in last week. I'm not supposed to be hassled.
we just want to search a room. - Not unless you've got a warrant.
you should've been a lawyer. - What the shit is this?
we're looking for a mr polson. - Room 27.
okay. Get it over with. - Is he alone?
a couple of girls went up.
you guys be careful. - And you stake out the lobby.
I'll let you handle it. Al. - Thank you.
this isn't exactly my life's ambition.
it's a part-time thing. I've got a kid who's staying with his granny.
you don't want to hear personal stuff. Are you listening to me?
did you hear a goddamn word i said?
how much money have you got left?
Hi. Liz. It's me. What's going on?
nothing. Just a couple of cops. How was your date?
you've got to stop sitting still for that kind of shit.
ask who it is. Right?
who is it? - Police. Open up.
open up. Right now. - Keep stalling.
hang on. I've got to put something on.
when i tell you to jump. You jump.
call for help now!
operator?
Jack. There are two of them.
stay here.
operator... - drop the phone. Lady.
let me go.
Billy. Bring her out. He ain't going to shoot.
come on.
shut up.
my god!
No!
you. Toss me that piece. And he won't waste him.
Jack. Don't give them the gun. Don't do it!
don't do that for me.
get the car.
nice gun.
what happened? - Read the report.
two cops get blown away by a credit card booster?
those guys were good cops. - They fucked up.
that's what you say. That's what you always say.
we're always fucking up. - The truth hurts.
it don't figure. - Can i borrow a piece?
when somebody steals your gun you usually file a report.
two cops died because you fucked up.
that isn't going to bring them back.
cates. I want to see you right away. Do you read me?
I hear you. Your voice carries. Five minutes.
there's a lot of people getting shot with 44s lately.
people must be getting mad about something.
you're an accessory to murder. - Give me a break.
his real name is albert ganz.
he's from back east. But did an armed robbery out here.
he broke out of prison a couple of days ago.
a real animal. Read this.
did he give you a return match. Or didn't he like the merchandise?
fuck you. - I'll take a rain check.
this is from the first weapon ganz used.
it's a perfect match. But it's not from the walden hotel.
it was fired six hours earlier. We found him on a park bench.
there are some bad people out there.
if there weren't. What the hell would we have to do?
he took me down. Then he put on the tv. Then you people arrived.
that's it. But i think he's going to give you guys a hard time.
he likes shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.
this is his stuff from the hotel. The big guy's room was empty.
a speedloader. This guy's got a 44 like yours.
he's serious about his artillery. - Here's the files.
Billy bear. - He's worked with ganz before.
who's this guy? - Henry wong. He worked with them.
Kehoe. Come here. I want to show you something.
tell me. Same guy? - Dick fucking tracy.
any of these guys still around? - One of them is in the slammer.
get in here. Cates. - Yeah!
goddamn speedloader! Kehoe.
I want to be left alone on this one.
there's an official department policy about cop killings.
any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a great danger to civilians.
we can't seem like we're in the revenge business.
what's bothering you?
it bothers me when cops get killed.
you might be more of a team player on this one. Hot dog.
hotdogging has been working real well so far. I've got a lead.
you can do things your own way.
you nail this guy and make us all look good.
but if you screw up. You're going down.
you know how to send a guy out with a real great attitude.
I'm here to see reggie hammond. - He's in 18.
you want company? - No. Thank you.
you don't have to sell your body to the night roxanne you don't have to put on the red light you walk the streets for money don't care if it's wrong or right roxanne!
is that hammond?
Hammond. - Put on the red light!
put on the red light! - Hammond!
have you got a name. Cop? - Cates. I want to talk to you in private.
you're single. No fixed address. No relatives.
one conviction. Armed robbery. Six months to go.
are you writing my life story? - Not likely.
I just need a little help.
it's henry wong. An old friend of mine. He's looked better.
I've been in that cell for 21/2 years. I'm getting out in 6 months.
you've come to the wrong person. I don't fuck my old friends over.
that's too bad. I thought maybe you were a smart boy.
I guess if you were real smart. You wouldn't be a convict.
a second-rater like you would be no help against ganz.
ganz will be in jail for two years after i get out.
it didn't work out that way. A big indian busted him out.
cates. - Yeah?
I can help you get ganz if you get me out of here first.
to get him i've got to be on the street.
I want ganz as bad as you. And we've got no time.
bullshit. - I'm serious.
get me out of here. - I'll think about it. Reggie.
Cates!
you've got to get me out of here. Man!
Cates!
fuck you!
let me borrow your pen. Bob. - Are you using your own name?
shit. No.
if all this comes down. I'm not going to burn for you.
and if it comes down. Your ass is new-mown grass.
you've got him for 48 hours. - Sure thing.
you've got a big career ahead of you as a forger.
Hammond. - Okay. Send him through.
you've got to sign him. He's all yours.
you need me more than you thought. - That shows you how desperate i am.
is that suit prison issue? - $957. i wore this shit in.
maybe we can get you dressed and go on a pussy hunt.
I've already got that department taken care of.
you've got a lady? The generosity of women never ceases to amaze me.
I don't work like this. No deal.
we have no deal. I own your ass. - What a way to start a partnership.
we ain't partners. Brothers. Or friends.
I'm keeping you until ganz is locked up or dead.
if ganz gets away. You're going to be sorry you ever met me.
I'm already sorry.
this is your car? It looks like you bought it from a brother.
I got you out. Where are we going?
we've got to see a guy called luther.
is luther part of the gang? - What gang. Jack?
I can read a police file. Shithead. And quit calling me jack.
it's better than shithead. - I may call you worse than that.
right up there. But he isn't expecting company.
Luther isn't very stable. I don't want you getting shot.
right there. 232.
what are the chances he's packed? - 100%.
you'd better leave me a gun.
sure thing. Asshole. You just hang on.
I hope this big move of yours turns out to be something.
what's happening. Luther? Did that hurt? It looked real painful.
Luther. I'm talking to you.
Hammond. Drop that gun. - Don't point that gun at me.
don't point your gun at me! - Hand me that gun.
I'm looking for ganz. - I haven't seen him for years.
you just took a shot at me. I think you know where ganz is.
who gives a fuck what you think?
you better tell this boy something. He's having a ball with this door.
Luther. Are you angry with me?
what are you smiling at? Your big move turned out to be shit.
I was defending myself.
I want to make a citizen's arrest. - Shut up!
what have you got there. Jack? - Carrying a concealed weapon.
resisting arrest. I'll think up some more tomorrow.
I bet you will. - Get him out of here.
Bye. Luther. - Fuck you. Reggie.
I want a lawyer.
you stay right here... okay?
get your hands off me.
you ladies look like you need some assistance.
we don't need some court-appointed lawyer trying to bullshit us.
the city is coming down on people involved with vice.
Hello? - Jack cates. Any messages?
some lady called to say she still wants her occasional roommate.
she'd like to talk it over tonight after work.
look. Elaine. I don't know when i'll be able to come by.
I'm working too hard at this.
I'm not happy about it. I've got a few things to take care of.
this is not the way people who care about each other behave.
shit!
you're both going to do a little time. 30 days each...
...unless we talk some real business.
we can go in this room. - Let's go.
I was about to get some trim. - We're not on a trim hunt.
my stomach is starting to growl. - We eat when i say we eat.
I want some food now. If you don't like it. Take me back to jail.
you've been treating me like shit. I want to eat in a nice place.
hold it. I'm hungry. Let's go get something to eat.
I want mandolins and violins...
here... there's your goddamn dinner.
come on.
who was that on the phone? - None of your business.
keep your mouth shut. - I think it was your lady.
what's her problem? - The same as half the population.
she can't get the job she wants. It pisses her off.
what do you care? - I'm in jail.
I was surrounded by guys in blue suits 24 hours a day.
the clothes you wear. You look like you'd love it.
where to. Convict? - Mission district. Indian hangout.
tell me about your girlfriend. - I don't give out details.
I've been in prison. I'm tired of hearing lies about pussy.
was it last week? - Last night.
was it fun? - Yeah...
in the morning we got in a fucking argument.
at least you took care of business first.
does she have big titties?
I can see this is going to be a long night. Convict.
what's the deal? - Billy used to work at this club.
I heard him talk about it. - This is a bad neighbourhood.
you just back me up. Pretend like you've got a piece.
they may beat me up. But they'd kill you.
it's amazing how far a gun and a badge will take some guys.
a bullshit attitude and experience is what gets you through.
white cops used to fuck with me and my friends.
they just flash their badges. - Experience is what counts.
you want to bet? - Two problems.
I ain't playing games. And you've got nothing to bet with.
if we get any kind of lead. Turn your back and let me get some pussy.
any man who talks about women like you. Can't get it up anyhow.
I've been in prison for three years. My dick gets hard if the wind blows.
it's a bet. But when you lose. You tell me the truth.
what is ganz after? - What are you talking about?
fuck you! The bet's off.
all right. Iook...
if i lose. I'll tell you everything you want to know.
you've got a deal. Hell. I might even give you my badge.
bullshit and experience is all it takes.
come on and experience some of my bullshit.
not a popular place with the brothers.
I always liked country boys. They'll sure as hell like you.
Howdy.
how do? - Yeah?
I'd like something to drink. Vodka.
how about a black russian?
black russian. That's a funny joke.
I'm black. But i'd rather have plain old vodka.
as we're standing here talking.
I wonder if you know where i could find billy bear?
never heard of him. - Never heard of billy bear?
look here...
you heard of him now? - What are you talking about?
I'll look around for a while. - I don't give a shit what you do.
good.
I've never seen so many backward-ass country fucks in my life.
you look like regulars. I'm looking for billy bear.
this is our place. Nigger.
you're a big. Tough. Country faggot.
are you out of your mind? Get up against that pole.
do you think i'm playing a goddamn game?
this is a police matter. I'm looking for an indian named billy bear.
I know everybody in here wants to cooperate with me.
that's not even necessary. I've got the situation in hand.
some of us citizens are behind you all the way. Officer.
what's you problem? - I'm on parole.
sit your country ass down.
listen up.
I don't like white people. I hate rednecks.
you people are rednecks. I'm enjoying this shit.
you're loaded here. - Tax refund.
bullshit! You're too stupid to have a job.
you don't like that? You hate that shit. Right?
what kind of cop are you? - I'm your worst nightmare.
I'm a nigger with a badge. I can kick your ass whenever i like.
one of them was underage. Another attacked a police officer.
you're going out of business.
let's see what we can fuck with next.
okay. Listen... the indian hangs out with a chick up the block.
Chinatown. She lives on top of the jewellery store.
I didn't ask about the girl. - You'll have to settle for that.
that's all i know.
look. Hoss. You start running a respectable business
and i won't have to come in here and hassle you every night.
the rest of you cowboys should know that there's a new sheriff in town.
his name is reggie hammond. You all be cool.
how's it going? - You've got something for me.
what are you talking about? - The gun you took off the redneck.
you saw that? - Yeah.
there you go. - And the switchblade.
you don't miss anything. Jack.
it was real smooth how i took it.
you owe me a piece of ass. Give me the gun. We'll call it even.
you did a good job. Reggie. You deserve a reward.
here.
fucking bastard. - That i am.
Hey! Let's go get us an indian down the alley.
I don't think anybody's home.
let's check around back.
I hope we have as much fun as we had in that hillbilly bar.
did you see the way i handled those boys?
why don't you get a megaphone and announce we're coming?
what the hell are they watching? - I don't know.
TV has changed. Get this.
that must be billy's girlfriend.
police. Nobody move. - Stay where you are.
drop it. Or he gets another one. - This girl thinks she's babe ruth.
police. Put the goddamn gun down. - Don't give me that police shit.
look. Don't shoot.
I'm just going to reach for my badge.
I've seen fake badges before. - Hey. Sweetheart...
listen up. This guy's one nervous cop.
shut up! I'm the calm type.
I know you don't want me to shoot you.
just hand me over the gun.
you assholes better be real. - Hey. Let's see your badge.
I don't have a badge. - Call the cops.
put that phone down. You're both going to answer some questions.
all right... which one of you sees billy bear?
the son of a bitch isn't here and he's not coming back.
you can do better than that. - He hasn't been here for two weeks.
it sounds like a stormy romance.
Yeah. I went a couple of laps around the track with him.
wait. I've been in prison for three years.
maybe these ladies would like to go around the track with us.
fuck off. - Come on.
if you find billy. Tell him to stay out of my life.
let's go.
this sucks!
a maniac gets hold of my gun and starts killing people with it.
I ought to be at home in bed with my girl.
not out on the streets with a charcoal-coloured loser.
just leave. I can take care of ganz by myself.
you can't take care of shit.
you've been dicking me around since we started.
you've given me nothing. - I'm impressed with you. Too.
kicking in the door on a couple of dikes.
either luther or you has to tell me what the fuck this is all about.
you got 48 hours. The clock's running.
I don't like the way you ask me. - Who gives a damn?
you're just a crook on a weekend pass.
you're just a spear-chucker with a prison number.
I'm through fucking around.
tell me the truth or i'll beat the shit out of you.
you're going to kick my ass? You've lost your mind.
I'm not in the mood.
it's going to be embarrassing for you and the police force.
look. Nigger. I fight dirty.
you little fucker!
don't put me in the fucking garbage! Get the fuck off!
what's going on here? - Nothing.
it's all right. I'm a cop. - Get your hands up.
I'm too fucking tired. My gun and badge are in the car.
check it out. Bill. Get in the car.
what the hell is going on?
two women called and said a couple of hoods broke in to their place.
we rousted them. You can straighten it out.
why don't you do it yourself? We've got better things to do.
I'll file a report tomorrow. - I'll file a report tonight.
it goes with the territory.
it's good your friends came. - You want to try it again?
you'd call your buddies back. - They saved your ass.
that's what you'll tell them. - I'll put it in my report.
I bet you will.
how much do i owe you? - Ten bucks.
mother fucker!
you come clean or we're going again. Right here and now.
I want to know what's going on between you and ganz.
I've been waiting for some money for a long time... $1/2 million.
are you starting to get the picture?
tell me about the money.
me and some friends hit a dealer during a sale.
it's the kind of money nobody reports stolen.
one of the guys dropped dime on me. He now has your gun.
he's after your money? - You're a real bright cop.
how much do you want? Do you want to split it 50-50?
not likely. Convict. - I can't have any of it?
I believe in the merit system. Boy.
I'll be real good from now on. - Where's the money?
in the trunk of my car.
right. Partner.
but get this: We ain't brothers. Partners or friends.
if ganz gets away with my money. You'll be sorry you ever met me.
Where's the goddamn car? - Be cool. The car's parked.
for three years? Bullshit! - Bullshit?
I'll let you in on a little secret. You just passed it.
now what? - Now you get to play cop.
watch that building while i have a sleep.
you son of a bitch! You knew where the money was all along.
I almost got my ass shot off. - Being a cop is a hard job.
the garage opens at seven o'clock. Wake me up at a quarter to.
Jack. Tell me a story.
fuck you! - That's one of my favourites.
Yeah. Yeah...
you're sleeping on the job. - They open in five minutes.
go look for ganz. - You took a chance leaving it here.
I knew ganz was away. I knew luther wouldn't cross me.
Lutherjust crossed the street.
the guy took a shot at a cop and is back out on the street.
the judicial system is shit.
I want to pick up my car. - What's the name?
Reggie hammond.
this is three years old. - Yeah. I've been busy!
al. Bring out 29-012. It's been here three years.
charge the battery. - We do that every month.
thanks a lot.
there he is.
look at all the dust on my car. He should take it to a car wash.
I didn't know darker people went in for foreign jobs.
some white asshole had just bought the last shitty sky-blue cadillac.
I hope none of my fellas sees me riding around in this car.
I don't care how it looks. - It has no class.
class isn't something you buy. Look at you in that $500 suit.
is that suit yours? - They used to be in style.
if you switch from armed robbery to pimping. You're all set.
that's the money.
look out!
Hey. Put that down.
Luther!
I'm going after the money.
come on. Stay close.
freeze. - I'm a cop.
meet me at vroman's. And bring the shit. Thank you.
vodka with a twist. And i'd like to run up a tab.
Hey. Baby. I'm reggie hammond. - So what?
Hey. My name's reggie hammond. - I'm with somebody.
how you doing? My name's reggie hammond.
this ain't my night.
you look awful. - Yeah? Well. So do you.
from what i've heard. You've lost ganz for the second time.
and some soul brother beat the crap out of you.
did any calls come in? - Nothing.
Kehoe. Ordnance.
your reports are late, cates. - They'll be in tomorrow.
you can depend on it. Bullshit.
I'm heading out. - I've got to wait for a call.
you really ought to get some rest.
Yeah. He's here. Cates. For you. Line three.
motherfucker. Where are you? - I'm at work. Asshole.
Elaine. I'm sorry. I thought it was somebody else. Police business.

how did my car get here? - I had it impounded.
you're going back to the slammer. - Ganz got away with all my money.

a lot of things don't seem right.
I could use a drink. I'll buy. It'll be my goodbye present.
I feel like i let you down. - No. It was a longshot.
we gave 'em a hell of a run. - But we didn't catch 'em.
Hello? - Let me talk to kehoe.
Kehoe. Answer the damn phone. It's for you.

no. I'll make it up to her tomorrow.
what about that big indian's girl? - He won't be going back there.
they found the bus down in chinatown.
maybe he's visiting his girl. - Billy's girl isn't interested.
she'll put a bullet in him. - Yeah. I'm reaching.

I got hit! I don't believe it. I got shot.
you're done. End of story. - You!
I've got to go. Okay?
here's something for you. - I'm not a pro.

I've got a cop waiting for me downstairs.
I'll be back in about six months and we'll go dancing.
okay. Take care of yourself. - You. Too.
see you later.
so tell me how great you were.
I don't go in for that macho shit.
I was great. I should have my dick bronzed.
is this what you want to talk about?
I've been waiting for that money for three years.
Where's your merit-system shit now?
it's your money. It'll be there when you get out.
you don't want any of it? - It's not my style.
I need a car. Loan me a couple of thousand when you get out.
what kind of car do you want? - A convertible. I'm a rag-top man.
deal. - Good.
even if you do give me the money for a car. It don't mean shit.
if i ever hear of you crossing the line. I'll bust your ass.
both of us know that i'm going to be honest from now on.
but if i did decide to be a thief. Do you think you could catch me?
can i have my lighter back. Reggie?
rockport is one of the best companies in the business.
the teams were tasked
with producing a fashion show for rockport shoes.
do well. Have fun.
project manager Wade had a relaxed attitude
let's just have fun. Let's not panic.
while project manager Stephanie
took a no-nonsense approach.
today is "operation win,"
not "pick on whatever each other's weakness is.
on the men's team, there was a concern
about David's prominent role
I'll open it. I'll pass it off to gene.
I'm gonna hand it to my brother from another mother.
david is a loose cannon.
to me, that's too much of an x-factor to trust.
but it was gene who dropped the ball.
you don't have this? No, I don't have
that's what I've been telling everybody.
it was like watching a horse die out there.
Liza spotted a flaw in kelly's casting
Yeah.
I noticed this guy wearing shorts,
and he's got these scabs on his legs.
but the women's presentation was a success.
brandy definitely kept the story going,
and there was a connection with the audience.
in the boardroom, Liza threw Kelly under the bus.
it was so clear, Kelly, and that's why I said
I didn't think that he should wear it with the scabs.
but the competition wasn't even close.
but your team so blew away the men that
thank you.
with the men in the firing line,
Mr. Trump questioned Wade's choice of emcee.
you should have picked Steuart and Anand.
they would have made a nice presentation.
Steuart, why didn't you put your hat in the ring?
cause he wants to harass women.
that's a very harsh accusation.
in the end, Gene shouldered the blame.
if you want to fire me, go right ahead.
but I think -- all right. Gene, you're fired.
and Mr. Trump didn't stop there.
I
you're fired.
I'm telling you, Kelly, right now,
from the very beginning, I was just so impressed with you.
but you didn't say that in the boardroom.
she could've been fired.
and now you look like a weak player.
and that's what concerns me more.
it's not the firing. It's
he's gonna remember. Yes!
I am a weak player in his eyes now.
and when I get sent home, Liza,
the first thing I'm gonna do is write you a thank-you note,
personally.
this is an absolute game changer for me.
I have been defending Liza since we've gotten here,
so it's game over for her.
the other women are gonna put her out of here,
and I'm not gonna stop them.
okay, there we go.
one, two, three, four
Oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god!
are you serious?
Oh, my god!
I hate the whole walk of shame
into the girls' war room after a loss,
and it was really humiliating when just four of us came back.
listen, you're nothing but a virus to this team.
who's here? Am I here?
you're here by the stroke of your ass, that's why.
that was completely uncalled for.
he accused us of
the only reason we wanted to be the ones picking out the wardrobes
was so that we could harass the women.
we saw that.
david: Who was raving Who was raving about seeing women today without clothes on? You.
come on.
talk, talk, talk, Steuart.
every boardroom has thrown me under the bus
about how, "David did this wrong," or, "David's this.
I don't care.
I have very thick skin, and I ultimately want to be the apprentice,
and I'm gonna have to bulldozer through to get there.
so, I might as well start now.
bring me in the boardroom with you if you lose.
fine. 'cause you'll go home and not me.
go toe-to-toe with me, buddy.
we'll just have to see there. We'll see. Okay.
money, money, money, money
money
money, money, money, money
money
Hello, Stephanie. Hi.
how are you? Nice to see you again.
nice to see you. Thank you for having me.
as the project manager,
because we won the Rockport Fashion-show Task,
I'm here to meet with Michael Rupp,
the CEO of rockport, and I'm very excited.
so, let's talk a little bit about you and your background.
I'm from Montreal.
I studied international business and marketing.
and I've been in banking for 10 years.
what is the field where you see yourself going?
I see myself in international marketing.
what we are offering you is to participate
in one of Adidas group's
advanced management training programs. Okay.
I feel as though I really connected with Mr. Rupp.
he's so polished, he's so professional,
and he's so enthusiastic about his vision.
I share that same passion for life and for business.
so, it could be a great opportunity,
and there could be potential for the future for me,
so I'm excited.
good morning.
good morning, Mr. Trump.
as you can see, they named a bus after me.
do you believe this?
today you're gonna be doing something very exciting.
you're going to be creating
your own pedicab tour of New York.
Ivanka, give them some details.
you're gonna have to pass a test to get your license,
then design a tour, sell it,
and ultimately pedal your asses off across the city.
it's all about the tour.
it's all about who makes the most money.
my advisers this week will be Ivanka and my son Eric.
who is going to be your project manager? Kelly?
I am, sir. You are?
I was very concerned
that Mr. Trump thinks that I'm a weak player.
so, being project manager on this task
is absolutely my chance to shine.
Anand, who is your project manager?
I am, sir.
I thought my time had come
to really step up and be project manager.
I think I've proven to be a leader on every task so far.
are you a fan of pedicabs?
I sure am, sir.
see, it depends, to me, on who the driver is.
if it's Clint, I don't want his ass in my face.
okay?
do a great job. It's not easy.
good luck.
welcome, you guys. How you doing?
well, our job today is to turn you into pedicab drivers.
when we arrive at the training facility,
I see several different pedicabs.
I see oranges.
I see wooden blocks on the floor.
it kind of reminded me of an obstacle course from PE.
in elementary school.
it's going where it wants to go,
not where I want it to go, though.
did I go through? Ooh! no!
I really feel like I'm about to fall.
damn it!
I got this.
he's got it.
all right. Good move, good move.
nice and strong.
can I try it once without a saucer?
no, no, you got to use one hand.
Aah!
it turns by itself!
riding a pedicab is nothing like riding a bike.
you start to go, and it's gonna crash to the floor.
it's very terrifying.
you guys did a great job.
most of you seem to be getting it,
but there are two I need to single out
because I'm concerned about your safety.
okay, so that would be Kelly and Mahsa.
I'm just afraid to let you out on the streets.
I think it's a very big blow to the team
when the p. M. Gets sidelined,
and we're gonna try and use that to our advantage.
what I'm really concerned about
is just being able to carry people in traffic.
new York city has some of the heaviest traffic
in the world.
who can't ride a bike? Seriously?
so, they didn't pass the test.
but we're gonna use them in sales,
so now they have no excuse.
they better sell twice as much as everyone else.
so, talk to me about what's going on, 'cause this is looking like a cluster
so we're in the middle of the task,
and I feel as though everyone's panicking, including Kelly.
and right now, everyone just needs to stay focused.
and later
Dave is the most classless, schizophrenic human
I have ever met in my life.
I implore you to rid us of this plague.
all right, guys.
I love the idea that has been tossed around
about a gimmick pedicab ride,
like a Spartacus-style chariot race.
okay, the task today is to manage and operate
a fleet of three New York pedicabs.
I think we have a great concept, guys.
I really like it.
our concept is,
turn the pedicabs into Roman chariots.
you know, guys dressed up in Roman outfits
and maybe have a little sword fight as we go.
shouldn't we go ahead and try to pre-sell a few?
pre-sales is absolutely a great idea
because we're guaranteed something.
maybe we just do it around Trump Tower.
we really felt that pre-sales were gonna be very important.
we decided to start marketing our service a day in advance
and really create a stir.
now, this is the chest strap
for the Steuart naked-man costume.
can you just focus on the task at hand?
well, what do you think I'm doing?
I'm outfitting you guys for your beautifulness.
Hi, folks. How's it going?
it's going very well.
I mean, obviously, there's a ton of competition,
so we wanted to do something
that's really gonna separate ourselves from the rest.
so, we came up with the idea of a Roman chariot pedicab.
Wow.
Ivanka's visit was great.
when we told her what we were planning on doing, her face lit up.
she seemed excited about it.
she thought it was innovative and original.
so I think we're really onto something here.
we want to really give a unique experience to whoever our customer is.
only in theory.
david is lurking in the background.
I really don't know what to make of him.
we'll see if he brings energy to the task tomorrow.
I didn't see a tremendous amount of energy today.
David, if you would slow down on the idle chatter,
it would help all of us right now.
it's a tense time right now for this deal.
we're trying to go make sales. We don't need that.
david did not contribute a single thing
to any discussion ,planning, brainstorming.
I mean, he did nothing.
so, he's resorting to these tactics to get attention,
and he's doing it to just be a wild guy.
and that'll only last for so long.
Shh!
no, no, you "shush." no, "shush" yourself.
David, I'm serious. You know
we got 20 minutes to wait before we go outside. Absolutely.
you know, it's fun to ruffle feathers.
I just do it because I like to get a rise, I guess.
and it's kind of funny.
let's focus on what we need to do.
let's get this job done.
end of story.
what about around?
Rockefeller.
no, I'm saying if we start at fifth avenue and 48th
Kelly sent us to go scout locations,
and me and the three blondes, we were the ones chosen.
so, we headed out to go check out the locations in person.
I always think, like, bankers.
so then we want to go into Wall Street.
targeting men?
men. Men.
Kelly? Hey.
I think we go where the men are with the money,
and the men with the money are on Wall street.
the first thing I did
was I assigned Stephanie to lead the sales and the tour route
because where we sold
would absolutely impact how much we were able to sell.
in selling, location, location, location is critical.
Yeah!
we came up with the concept of "babes on bikes"
because we definitely think sex will help sell,
particularly because we're going to wall street.
let me ask you, though,
the men near Wall Street will mostly be working.
do you think they'll stop out of their day to do this with us?
Yeah, because you will be there to get the lunch crowd.
Oh, okay.
you know that world more than I do.
don't worry.
call me when you all get down there,
and let's -- let's sync up.
Bye.
as project manager, I'm very nervous.
I didn't think that moving to wall street was a great idea.
I really felt that for a pedicab ride,
we should have gone where the tourists were.
but I tell you the truth
if these girls can pull it off, then I'll support it.
regal roman chariot tours, starting tomorrow at 10: 00 AM
tour midtown, tomorrow, 10: 00 AM!
there's a lot of people outside trump tower,
whether it's tourists or just New Yorkers.
and it's a great location
if you're trying to sell something, attract attention.
would you folks like to ride a chariot
around New York tomorrow, 10: 00 to 1: 30?
15-minute intervals?
pre-sales were gonna be important for us.
we wanted to actually get some money in our pocket the night before.
should we do it?
all right. This -- this has never been done before.
you're the first ones.
0.416666666667
now, what was your name?
your chariot awaits!
your chariot awaits? Does your chariot await?!
you know, I've been to a couple cockfights and a monkey wrestling,
and I have never seen anything like David.
see the massive Clint lose weight!
you got your Roman Chariot
I shall slit-ith his neck if you do not ride on the Roman Chariot!
I thought you were catching those people coming that way?
every time I got close to making a sale,
david comes rolling up, screaming like an idiot,
falling down like a drunk man on his sword.
that really instills confidence in someone
who's gonna be riding around in New York with you.
Careth for a royal ride of regalness tomorrow?
be gone!
someone heard you say
you can't do that, Kelly.
why would you say that?
mahsa and Stephanie threw a hissy fit.
they basically were acting like children.
he is a negative influence on all of us.
Clint, Chill out. Hey, get your hand out of my face, David.
chill out. I will remove that hand if you ever put it in front of my face again.
you understand me?
where are our pedicabs?
are our cabs here? Yeah, there they are.
the task is to manage and operate three pedicabs
here in New York City and generate the most revenue.
hello. How are you? Welcome, welcome.
I chose to stay back on the initial run
because I felt that I was one of the stronger salesmen
and I'd be able to wrangle in customers
while I sent three others out to drive our passengers around.
so, basically, we're gonna go through
the fifth avenue shopping district first,
and we'll work our way down towards the diamond district.
and then we'll come back up sixth ave.
this is the St. Thomas Episcopal Church.
notice the architecture -- some amazing work up here.
we have the Peninsula Hotel
very famous.
up here on the left is also Cartier.
everything on this street has to do with money
which I don't have much of.
maybe that's why the wife left -- no more money.
St. Patrick's cathedral coming up on our left.
and there is 30 rock.
that's where the christmas tree is,
the "today" show's being filmed.
uh, funny story
my great-great-grandfather was actually killed by a mule.
100% true.
out of my way!
we're at a gingerly pace, my friend.
you are giving them a robbery of a tour!
how about a little swordplay, my friend? Oh!
I hath been slayed!
is it a good idea to put David on a bike?
where else do you put him? On the cash box?
he might be out there
folding dollar bills into paper airplanes and flying them around.
who knows?
he's on a time limit.
you know what I said to time limit?
you guys are my limit of time.
to me, the best place to have him was on a bike. Maybe a car will hit him.
Yeah, and then I joined the service.
so, yep, I served for, you know, six years
four active, two reserve.
you guys ever see "City of Joy" with Patrick Swayze?
Hi, guys.
stop by at pine and williams today!
bike tours! babes on bikes!
come take a ride with us! come on, guys!
the task began,
and we started selling as hard as we could.
guys!
I like that outfit. Biker babes.
Where's it gonna be again? At the corner.
I think this location is ideal 'cause we're targeting men with money
and we're selling sex.
Hi, sir. What about you?
15 minutes, come on over!
it'll just take 15 minutes.
you sound like one of those creepy massage parlors, brandy. Come on!
thai Massage. Massage, uh-huh!
real fast!
Hi, sir.
no, thanks.
right now, we don't seem to be having a lot of success.
the issue is there's just
people aren't really interested.
babes on bikes!
an experience you'll never forget!
it'll be awesome.
it's only 15 minutes of your time.
only 15 minutes, ma'am.
Stephanie has picked the wrong location.
I mean, I haven't even taken one person on a ride.
everybody I talked to
it didn't even matter how much it is.
they're just really not interested.
they're busy. People are going about their business.
and we really have to, like, change the game.
Hi.
free tour today!
Oh, I'm fine, thanks. Okay.
we're gonna be giving away a free 15-minute ride
around the financial district.
Liza is doing an awful job at sales, as always.
she starts throwing in, free, free.
people think it's free, and they get kind of annoyed
when they find out it's not free.
Hi, we're gonna be giving away a free tour today.
Oh, thank god.
I did.
babes on bikes! come check it out!
so, let's -- let's come together very quickly.
okay, so talk to me about what's going on, 'cause this is looking like a cluster and we need to fix it very soon.
okay, um, what's going on is that
we can't get people interested.
so, we're in the middle of the task,
it's not yet lunch hour,
and I feel as though everyone's panicking, including Kelly.
this is classic sales. Sales is not always easy.
it's a numbers game,Kelly. Don't worry.
no, I'm not worried about you all.
I'm worried about the
I need people.
they're coming.
you have to work hard. That's why not everyone's in sales.
and there's peaks and valleys.
and right now, everyone just needs to stay focused.
lunchtime is gonna be awesome.
this sucks.
Stephanie was in charge of finding the location,
and she was also in charge of sales,
and neither of those two really played out.
Hi, sir.
the location is absolutely horrible.
I mean, there's really no other way to say it.
there's not enough just regular foot traffic on this block,
and the people who are coming have somewhere to be.
so right now,
we're all pretty much just hanging out on the corner.
maybe this was a bad idea.
maybe we should have been in the tourist area.
Yeah.
this sucks.
Oh, Poppy, that's the same guy you were talking to.
you'll do it? Awesome.
all right, so I'll take you around,
right around here.
awesome.
at least we broke the ice.
the first hour was slow,
but the big rush would be at lunch.
so, at 11: 30, people started to come out of the office.
that's when everything started to pick up,
and that's when we started to sell.
Hi, guys. Pedicab ride.
sure, why not? Okay.
15 minutes, right?
Yeah, yeah, 15 minutes.
all right, perfect.
High-five, sir. Thank you so much.
Thanks, guys.
between 11: 30 and 1: 00, we really sold.
there was always at least one bike out on the road.
so, we were doing well.
thank you so much.
can you do it 10 minutes?
we could do it in 10 minutes. Is it possible?
Yeah. All right, yeah.
I'll support you guys. Thank you.
and Poppy will take you 'cause she's super fat.
poppy, can you help her?
I think everybody really hustled out there.
but I must say that Poppy, who has no sales experience
every time I looked up,
poppy either had somebody walking to her cart
or on her cart.
Ahh! now we're in action.
Oh, we are definitely in action.
this is actually extremely, extremely sexy.
I haven't been looking at Wall street
for the past 15 minutes over there.
Oh, my god!
Roman chariot tour of New York!
if you ladies are having a good time, feel free to tell everybody.
we're gonna do my traditional running start
like I'm a bobsled member.
ready? Dig! dig!
ride our Roman chariot tour around New York.
it's going good. I think it's picking up now.
we actually have some people riding.
in fact, all three carts are out.
right now there's people walking by me
just trying to snag every one of them.
so, we started slow but we're -- people love us.
Yes!
take the ride! listen to the customers!
the most frustrating part of this task
was dealing with David.
but other than that, I think everything went very well.
today was all about execution,
and we put on a great show for our customers.
everybody had a really good time.
pedicab ride, 15 minutes.
what about you guys?
ladies, this is the last push,
so find everything in the bottom of your toes.
Yeah.
Hey, guys. How are you doing?
we're doing babes on bikes today.
let's go. Yes.
yes?
do you think you're beating the guys right now?
we'd hope
we definitely hope that we're beating the guys right now.
we're standing out there selling as hard as we can,
and I look up and see Eric Trump.
look at this.
I was relieved because the moment he came
happened to also have been our busiest moment.
I think
I think Poppy is -- is doing an amazing job today. Poppy's doing well?
I just sold four people rides.
you did, but Poppy's selling and riding,
so I have to give it to Poppy today.
all right. That's fine. But, I mean, honestly
what the...
poppy is a joke.
she's 23. She has no experience.
she has absolutely no leadership abilities.
and what people are you targeting?
young men in ties, dressed like yourself. Obviously.
well, great. Keep doing a good job.
I couldn't shut up.
I actually had to say something.
I'm really serious about that.
she told that to Eric? That really pisses me off.
we're, like, the ones selling the most here.
I'm really pissed.
I'm so pissed, I can't even tell you.
we're the ones who went out and got all these people
and brought them here.
today was very frustrating.
Argh!
myself and mahsa were busting our butts selling.
we kept this team afloat, and we got no credit.
poppy got credit. I mean, how random.
I think it's too,
that everyone's trying to take credit for everything.
it doesn't matter.
and then when Eric came, someone heard you say
you can't do that, kelly.
why would you say that?
Yes, I made the comment, period.
mahsa and Stephanie threw a hissy fit.
and they, basically, were acting like children.
allow someone else to have recognition other than you.
I don't even care. It seems like people were just coming up to me.
well, obviously you care, because Stephanie knows about it.
Stephanie's bringing it to me, so she cares.
mahsa is extremely overbearing.
I mean, I think that it's just a lot of insecurities.
you know, people
that are really, truly confident in themselves
don't need to tell other people why they're so wonderful.
it's like, you know what? I did sales, too.
for us to work as a team.
I have continually said that.
I was asked a question, and I answered it the way that I felt was fitting.
of course you have to
Mahsa's pissed off.
that that's not the kind of energy that our team needs.
if we have to fight, let's fight it out at the end
when we're in the boardroom
and we have to make a decision about who goes home.
but during the task,
we need to stay focused, and we need to stay positive.
ladies, we're at five minutes.
only five minutes left to sign up!
come on, guys! have a little fun.
I got two minutes left to sell you.
come take a ride with the babes on bikes!
hail to Caesar!
Anand, what was the theme of your tour and who came up with it?
you know, Mr. Trump,
we wanted to really separate ourselves from the rest
and do something very different.
so, we chose a Roman chariot-style pedicab
and you thought it was a great idea.
immediately, the moment that came out, it just sounded fun.
it sounded unique.
and I actually have to credit Clint here.
is Clint a strong player?
Clint is a very strong player, Mr. Trump.
I know he's physically strong,
but is he a strong player? He's also mentally strong,
and he's such a huge contributor.
I feel very confident in the job that our team did.
Thanks, man.
and I am very confident that we won.
okay.
so, Clint, how did your team do?
Mr. Trump, I believe we
I believe we may have pulled one out today.
but before we get there,
do you mind if I tell you a little bit
about my buddy Dave here?
no, go ahead.
Dave is the most classless, schizophrenic human
I have ever met in my life.
Dave cannot find his rear end in the bathtub
when it comes to business.
he is a disruption. He's a problem.
and, frankly -- win, lose, or draw tonight, sir
I beg you -- I implore you,
to rid us of this plague before we go any further,
or we won't be able to function.
that is probably the strongest group of words
I've ever heard on the apprentice.
well, it's strongly felt, sir.
I just want to sit here and say
that I completely 100% back up Clint in his statement.
and to the point where we've nicknamed David "the virus."
I have to say that working with Anand and Clint
I mean, I'm very confident we won this task, but
it's a breath of fresh air. We work good together.
it was literally because we killed for that victory.
Mr. Trump, it was three against six. It wasn't four against six.
no, it was two and a half,
because he is a negative half to one influence on all of us.
Clint, chill out. Hey, get your hand out of my face, David.
chill out. I'll remove it if you want me to.
you're real cautious when someone touches you, so -- just hush for a minute. Just hush for -- Clint.
I will remove that hand if you ever put it in front of my face again.
you understand me? You know
it's been almost impossible,Mr. Trump. In a task like this,
where we only have four people on our team
and we have three pedicabs
and we need to have one person trying to garner sales
david needs to be micromanaged.
I also note -- David, how do you feel right now?
you're getting beaten up very badly.
how do you feel?
I knew that the three of them didn't like me.
uh, I don't respect them.
they don't respect me. It's obvious.
so, what happens if your team wins
and you have to put up with David for another week?
you know, Mr.Trump
if we have to put up with him,
it's just got to continue the way it has been with babysitting.
what are you gonna do? Are you gonna be able to function?
sir, you have something
and you know you have the power to help us
even if we win, lose, or draw.
and I'm imploring that you end this for us tonight.
but, you know, the game's not played that way.
if you win, I can't fire David.
David, if you win,
as a team, what are you gonna do to mend this?
I mean, you've already stated you don't respect anyone.
well, the
I can fall on my sword when I need to.
I can make amends the best.
it's will these guys accept a change?
you know, we change for things that we want.
I want this bad.
so, am I willing to change to live with these guys
to make sure we can win the next task and I can contribute?
of course.
now I think they're gonna be very close to you after that wonderful
well, that's what I want.
I was moved.
you want to make amends now and work harder,
when you should have been doing that the first five weeks.
sir, there have been more apologies
there's not been apologies, Clint.
but they've been so contrived,
and you've turned out to be just a loopy nut on this team.
Clint, just watch the words. No, that's true.
every word I use -- I choose my words precisely. "loopy nut"?
and "loopy" and "nut" both apply to you to the "team.
you couldn't get a job as an loompa-loompa making gobstoppers.
you absolutely shouldn't be here
applying for Mr.Trump's position.
it's just -- it's -- it's insane.
I'm sorry. It's ridiculous.
that was funny.
so, Kelly? -Yes?
...as project manager, if you don't win this task,
you should be ashamed of yourself.
in all of the years,
I've never seen anything like this.
it's quite dysfunctional, sir.-- You think you'll win?
I think we'll win, sir. Were you happy with your team?
I like my team very much.
I really enjoy working with them.
we have a much stronger team dynamic than the men, obviously.
what was the theme of your team?
the theme that our team decided on
was babes on bikes.
and whose idea was that?
it was a collective decision,
but I think I can credit Brandy, ultimately,
for coming up with the tagline.
and, Brandy, how did you come up with that idea?
I think, actually, it was mostly the team.
we all had felt, based on previous tasks,
that we hadn't used, sort of, sex appeal
to our full advantage.
and we all felt very comfortable in the way that we did it.
okay, good.
Eric, when you followed the team, what did you notice?
it seemed like there were
some people who were really doing a lot,
and there were some people who were doing less.
you know, right away, I saw Brandy and Poppy.
they were going over to guys on wall street,
grabbing their arms, trying to get them in.
they were pedaling.
I also saw Kelly -- not to single you out
Mm-hmm.
you know, you were the team leader.
you had failed the pedicab school.
and you weren't doing
nearly as an effective job selling.
I would agree with you
on the bicycle licensing part. I did fail the test.
but I was a very effective seller.
we have different selling styles.
mine is less aggressive,
but I wouldn't say it's not as effective.
I did close sales today.
Kelly, who was the least effective?
in terms of selling? The team.
no, in terms of winning.
overall, I think that Liza
has the greatest opportunity for growth
professional growth. Why? Why?
I think she's probably been exposed
to this type of business environment the least.
I think she definitely has passion and commitment for it.
by the way, that could be true. Don't you think so,Liza?
no, I wouldn't say that, Mr.Trump.
they've all been working for businesses,
but I've actually had my own business
and I worked a full-time job.
and, I mean, I had my golf scholarship.
so, saying that I don't have the same experiences they do
is completely false.
that's not really a bad thing, you know.
but she was saying you probably don't have the same experience,
and that could be true.
so, Mahsa, my New Yorker
you think your team won?
I-I hope that we won, sir.
you think you won?
I'm not sure,
but I hope that we won, sir, and I will say
well, what does that mean? Do you think you won?
Mr. Trump... tell me.
I have a very good idea of what we sold,
how much we sold.
I know who sold what, and I hope that we won.
all right. Well, okay.
so, Mahsa, who was your team's weakest link?
you know what, Mr. Trump?
from what I saw, keeping track of who sold what,
I would say Liza sold, let's say, the least. Can I say something, Mr. Trump?
Yes.
in this situation, where we have a brand
that we're trying to sell, "babies on bikes."
I was on the corners yelling to people,
and maybe somebody heard it on the other side
and came this way, and then somebody else just happened to be there and made the sale.
it's all about sales.
it doesn't matter who you're talking to.
so, you can say what you want to say,
but if you stood individually on one corner
but Liza, maybe you won, okay?
I know, Mr.Trump, but I'm
let's find out who won. Shall we?
Yes, Mr.Trump.
men, are we ready?
Yes, sir.
all right, Eric, tell me, how did the women's team do?
well, fortitude made $320.
Ivanka, the men?
octane made $950.
so, that's not even close,
and, to be honest with you, Kelly...
kind of embarrassing.
...that is not a good performance
against a totally dysfunctional group of people.
that would be correct. So, Anand, congratulations.
thank you very much, Mr. Trump.
and as the winning project manager,
Ivanka has a friend who's absolutely terrific.
tell us about your friend.
you're gonna be meeting with Chuck Davis,
the CEO Of Fandango and Dailycandy.
Oh! so, as a small-business owner,
you know exactly what an endorsement from Dailycandy means to viability.
I know a lot about Dailycandy. I'm so excited.
all right, men. A lot of my friends are gonna be jealous.
go to your suite. You can watch on television.
thank you.
thank you very much, Mr. Trump. Okay.
enjoy it.
thank you.
great job, guys.
women, you stay here with me. Somebody's about to be fired.
Kelly, as I said before,
as project manager, if you don't beat the men,
you should be ashamed of yourself.
I'm very ashamed.
by the way, you not only lost, they killed you. They clobbered you.
decimated us, sir. Embarrassingly, sir.
so, what do you attribute it to,
and who do you attribute it to?
sir, this is so difficult,
because I think everybody put in it
and tried to do an amazing job today.
everybody tried to sell,
but I ultimately have to say
I think our -- our location was not optimal.
so, let me ask you this.
the men chose trump tower,
which is, you know, a very, very busy place.
you chose Wall Street.
I have a big building on Wall Street, too.
but I would think it's somewhat of a disadvantage.
so, who picked the location?
Stephanie was assigned to pick -- to select the location.
I was not assigned sales and ride the bike and location.
wouldn't that make me the whole company?
no, you were assigned sales and location scouting, yeah. --I can't
but Stephanie said you didn't ask her to pick location.
well, of course, because she failed at her task, sir,
so of course she's gonna say that.-That's absurd.
who went scouting the location?
those are the people picking the location.
so, who -- what are you saying, Liza?
that's crazy.
they're the ones who spent like two hours...
well, who scouted location?
...looking at a map -- what do you need the scouting for?
who picked the concept of Wall Street, the area of Wall Street?
that would be our sales manager, Stephanie.
because, to be honest with you, you didn't have a chance
the minute you decided on wall street.
and there's plenty of people on Wall Street,
but they're focused on money, money, money.
the last thing they want to do
is ride your pedicab, right?
well, it's interesting that you say that, sir,
because Stephanie was also focused on money, money, money,
and her point was that these men who have all this money
would not mind paying an exorbitant fee for their -- Stephanie, why Wall Street?
we made a group decision
and, by the way, you don't have a lot of tourists on wall street.
no, there weren't tourists on wall street.
no, we weren't attracting tourists
because Kelly wanted us to sell $50 rides.
Kelly wanted it? Kelly wanted that? Yes.
you were adamant about the $50 rides.
Stephanie, the first thing out of your mouth
was that we needed to sell to rich men.
this is all Stephanie. "where are the rich men? Wall street."
and for someone who has Stephanie's sales background -- ask the other members of the team, sir.
as project manager, I did delegate that to her.
how could you delegate everything to one person?
I did delegate that to her. The whole company
what if I get hit by a bus?
this girl and the whole team would have gone down
according to what she's saying right now. It doesn't make sense.
well, we may have fared better, Stephanie.
well, I will say this, Kelly.
Yes. --As project manager, you are putting an awful lot of criticism on Stephanie.
right! On one person.
we divided the task between -- I mean, you would think, as project manager,
you would say, "well, I don't like Wall Street."
and she had four team members to exercise the sales task.
we all know and we all had been told...
so the project manager did nothing is what she's saying.
...that Stephanie was the strongest person on the team in terms of sales.
she didn't ride, she didn't sell, and she didn't pick a location.
who would you fire if you were me?
I would fire Liza because it comes down
Liza?! what the hell is it with Liza? I would fire Liza.
because Liza did not sell one thing, Mr. Trump. Liza, did you not sell?
let me explain something to you, Mr. Trump.
I went around and I screamed on the streets.
how many did you sell? Sales?
dollar numbers? Okay, here's the thing.
not one. Not one.
you know what?
I was yelling as much as I can. In all fairness to her,
I couldn't sell on Wall Street, either.
I think these men,
these wealthy men that we're talking about,
would be fired if their bosses looked out the window
and saw them on the back of a pedicab...
and that's what they kept saying...
...with a bunch of babes on bikes.
...was, "ooh, my boss might see me.
poppy, if you were me, who would you fire?
Liza, what is it with you?
you see, and the thing is, Mr. Trump, it's just
it's embarrassing to them because they're choosing me
to be kicked off this team
when I wasn't even the one to blame for the location.
Mahsa, let me ask you this one question. you know New York
right. ----more than any of them
Mr. Trump
how do you allow your team, even though you're not project manager
Yes.
how did you allow your team to choose Wall Street?
Mr. Trump, we just displayed the facts.
we went to Rockefeller Center. There was a lot of tourists.
we didn't think that moms and families
wanted to get on babes with bikes.
and the men with the money are on Wall Street,
and we were targeting sex appeal and
I know, but weren't you targeting tourists?
I think we were targeting -- how could you not be tar
who else is gonna ride in one of these things?
we didn't tar
you think a New Yorker is gonna ride in a pedicab?
who was responsible for marketing?
we were responsible for marketing, but, sir, let me say
who's we? -Liza and I.
that's right.
Oh, that's absolutely not true. You're the project manager,
and you keep using the word 'we, we', the whole team.
no. I -- I--
absolutely, sir.
you know, a leader is a leader. It's you. It's not the team. I -- absolutely, sir.
Mm-hmm. Absolutely, sir.
I led the marketing along with Liza. All right, Kelly.
Kelly. Yes, Mr. Trump.
I want you to pick two people to bring back to the boardroom. Yes.
who?
I'm going to pick Liza to come with me,
and I'm also going to ask Stephanie to stay with me.
okay.
Liza, Stephanie, and Kelly,
you'll come back to the boardroom.
everyone else, go back to your suite.
you made it. All, go.
thank you.
Whew.
Amanda, let them in.
Yes, sir.
ladies, you can head back in now. Mr. Trump is ready.
sit down, please.
Kelly, what happened?
sir, it's very black and white.
we lost this task because of location.
and ultimately,Stephanie was tasked to find the location,
and she failed in doing so.
why would she task location and sales
and managing all the people to one person?
what she's saying is not truthful.
actually, she tasked sales to me.
so, my responsibility in sales was to script everyone,
make sure we were all on the same page.
but don't you think sales is also about location?
it's absolutely about location! no, she tasked location to the group.
that's fundamental.
it's location, location, location. To the group. And to the
you and three -- can I finish?!
I gave you the most team members. Kelly, please.
please. Go ahead. This is the leadership we had.
Stephanie, just talk.
she tasked sales to me.
and to the group, she tasked location,
of which Mahsa took the lead because Mahsa's from New York.
where are you from?
I'm from Chicago, and I'm from Canada!
I have no clue about New York City.
Liza, let me ask you this question.
if you were me, who would you fire?
Kelly or Stephanie?
in this task, I would actually fire Kelly.
and that's because she was project manager?
it's because she was project manager, and maybe she should have really
just known more about the location that they picked
and why it wouldn't work
when they went on the road to scout it.
let me ask you.
wouldn't it be an obvious thing
to go and poll a bunch of pedicab drivers
and ask them, what are the most viable locations in the city?
it's not rocket science.
you don't need to take four people,
scatter them across the city.
Stephanie was adamant that...
that's not true.
...if we were going to sell. I was not responsible for marketing.
did you agree with her?
Stephanie has the most sales experience on this team.
I am not a salesperson, and so I rely on her.----That's not location.
that's location.
for me, us losing -- you're from New York.
you lived in New York. I am not from New York.
I have lived in New York.
so, why would you rely on someone from Canada?
Stephanie, you're a banker.
you're a banker.
why wouldn't you know that people on Wall Street...
I have no idea about location.
why wouldn't you know that people on Wall Street
do not have 15 minutes to have
why would she not pick location herself
Kelly, let me ask you a question.
yes? What were you doing?
good question. Meaning it seemed like everybody
had something delegated to them, but
Absolutely.
and the reason for that is, as project manager,
what was most critical for my role
was to put the people where they would be successful.
I knew that Stephanie -- she doesn't -- she can't
Stephanie, hold it. Stephanie. She's a strong salesperson, and I put her in that capacity.
and, quite frankly, sir, she failed miserably. And then did nothing.
well, I had no marketing plan and no location.
but, Kelly, wouldn't you say
that she was put in a different position,
not really the position of choosing the location?
Yes. She was -- she was selling.
she was riding. You weren't riding, right?
Yes, correct. She was -- she was in the car
you really weren't selling. No.
Kelly, wouldn't you say that, as the project manager,
you should have maybe spoken to Mahsa
or somebody that knows more about New York as to where trying to make your money?
in all fairness to Stephanie,
she knows nothing about new york, so, ultimately,
aren't you responsible for picking the location?
I am responsible for what happens with the team, sir,
but I can only lead.
I have to able to trust my people
to do what it is they're supposed to do.
but, Kelly, don't you think it's very simple?
you failed the test.
Mm-hmm. You failed the task!
Kelly, you're fired.
sorry, go.
thank you.
wrong girl to turn against.
Oh, shut up, Stephanie.
I'm telling you. Wrong girl. Whatever.
whatever, Stephanie.
that was all too obvious.
I agree.
Stephanie absolutely lied about picking the location.
she was responsible for going to Wall Street,
and, ultimately, she was wrong.
but, you know, at the end of the day,
I was project manager,
and I was responsible for that decision.
so, that's a fall that I'll accept.
but things have a very funny way of working out,
and I'm sure that Stephanie will fall on her sword very soon.
rockport presents next steps.
so, my goal from this point on is to go forward,
start my own firm, and be in a position
where I can empower women and children.
I hope that I will be able to use
my communications and PR Background
to advance causes that affect the world
and really make us all have a better place to live.
rockport -- put your best foot forward.
to put on a Broadway play or musical, you need backers.
your task is to produce a backers audition.
on the men's team, project manager Steuart...
found a way to manage David, by utilizing his talents.
I want Nan center stage.
and we begin.
while on the women's team...
...Stephanie was disappointed with the role given to her by project manager Liza.
I'm a musical expert!
I studied with the royal conservatory.
why am I out printing a flier?
the next day, after two strong presentations,
Mr. Trump announced the winner...
the men's team.
...and David's efforts were recognized.
one of the best comebacks I've seen.
but the women came under fire
for their marketing materials.
I don't even know how to get in touch with anybody.
whose fault is it?
ultimately, the ladies who went to do the graphic design
I am a music expert.
I know. And why weren't you the project manager?
at the beginning, I thought it was theater.
you knew it was musical because I said musical. No, I didn't.
you lied to me.
left to face Mr.Trump,
brandy brought up new information
that turned the boardroom on its ear.
she told the men's team, in the last task,
how much we made in the task.
it's such
is that true?
Yes. Clint told me, too, sir.
and Mahsa's accusations forced clint to take action.
I wanted to come back and clear my name.
I never divulged the number that our team made.
in the end, mahsa paid for her mistake.
do you think you made a mistake?
I absolutely made a mistake.
Mahsa, you're fired.
you know, mahsa and I have never had a cross word.
why do you think she invoked my name?
because she was -- it was a sinking ship.
of course not.
I was shocked that she would actually tell me a number.
the win is very bittersweet.
to me, it's more bitter than sweet,
but I feel like I've been vindicated.
I'm here for a bigger reason than myself,
and I'm not gonna be thrown under the bus like that.
I fundamentally disagreed
with Mahsa's approach to the game,
and that's why I brought it up in the boardroom today.
I definitely have a fire within me,
and I will stand up for what I believe in.
she was gonna be a tough one to take down,
and I'm glad she's gone.
and I'm glad I was the one that did it, to be quite honest.
I have rid myself of my problems.
I like everybody else on the team now.
who did the graphic-design stuff?
who did the promotional items?
no one did that. That's the thing.
we were supposed to focus on marketing.
well, who worked with the printer? Who worked with the designer?
I wasn't there.
you were the last person to work with the printer.
you forgot to put the contact information.
why aren't you minding your own business?
Ohh!
you're a liar.
you weren't even there!
I didn't lie. Shut up. I didn't lie.
you lied -- you lied to Mr. Trump.
you're such an idiot! shut the up!
I think you're really classless.
I have never been called classless
by some punk.
and anyone who pushes me up against a wall
and criticizes me out of the blue,
who are you to judge me?
you weren't even there.
no one has the right to call anyone out
unless you were there.
Hey, you just need to convince yourself,
and it looks like you've done that, so congratulations.
he's on his high horse,
thinking he has the right to judge everyone.
talk about classless, Anand.
I wouldn't want to work with someone like that.
Steuart, how are you? Very good.
nice to see you. Pleasure to meet you.
welcome to Snapple Theater.
thank you for having me. Have a seat.
I won the Broadway task
and got the opportunity to now meet larry young,
the CEO Of snapple.
what's great about it for me is,
I want to be in the distribution business.
so gonna be really awesome to leverage his knowledge
and be able to just learn anything I can
in the amount of time I've got with him.
it's a complex business.
it's something you have to stay on top of all the time.
it's tough. It's very tough. It is.
especially in this, uh, this economy.
I tell the guys at work,
whether you're marketing a brand or just your name,
you got to believe in it
and really make people know who you are out there.
my meeting with Larry was really informative.
and, hopefully, all the information I gain from him,
I can use back in the real world.
you got to love what you do, and you got to laugh every day.
maybe he'll start distributing one of my brands one day.
all the best, pal. Appreciate it.
all right.
good morning.
now, what I'm going to do is switch teams.
and I want brandy and liza to go with Clint and Steuart.
switch over.
here we go, boys.
Liza, Steuart, Brandy, Clint, you're a team.
Stephanie, David, Anand, Poppy, you're a team.
I didn't want to be with Anand.
if he tries to bully me around,
I will put him in his place any time of day.
I'm not gonna break. I'm gonna come at you.
okay, we're standing in front of Macy's at Herald square,
the largest department store anywhere in the world.
to my right is Terry Lundgren,
the president and chairman of Macy's.
years ago, Terry approached me about doing a line of Donald Trump shirts, ties, and cuff links.
they've been a tremendous success. Is that right, Terry?
that's absolutely right.
I'm dressed head to toe in Donald Trump.
Oh, very good. Very good. And so am I.
what you're going to do
is a 4-page advertisement
for Donald Trump signature line
shirts, ties, and cuff links.
Terry, how will you be judging them?
I'm gonna judge your advertisements
on the following criteria
creativity, brand integration,
and of course the overall presentation of the work.
with me are my advisers
my sons, Eric and Don.
who is your project manager? Decide.
okay.
you guys are gonna have to back me up, 'cause I don't know anything about shirts and cuff links.
Oh, yeah.
and I got a good layout.
you got a good team. Okay. That sounds good.
David, who's your project manager?
Mr. Trump, I am, sir.
you are again, david? Yes, sir.
I'm on a hot streak.
I got some praise from Mr. Trump in the boardroom.
and when you have a hot hand, you play it.
and so I decided to step up and be project manager.
Clint, who is your project manager?
brandy has stepped up. Brandy.
I love a well-dressed man, so...
all right. Very good. Remember one thing
this is a very personal task, because it has to do with me.
do a great ad and impress me, please.
good luck.
this is gonna be fun.
all right.
team Fortitude is now David, Anand, Stephanie, and myself.
david has been described as a loose cannon
by his fellow male teammates. We'll see.
there are two parts to this thing.
I mean, I've been assigned working with models,
working with actors every time.
wait. Let me chime in for one second.
this is a male line of clothing.
right.
so I think we need men's input, as well.
anand and Poppy -- they got a good eye for fashion.
this is what I want you to do.
get the models in here,
make sure everything fits, they look good.
poppy's got, you know, youthful appeal
that will, you know, relate to the models in many ways.
we need a concept, of course.
what if you did black-and-white
like, the Trump bar scene was all black-and-white.
but everybody else in color!
except for the shirts, except for the shirts.
Yeah.
that's artistic.
and that showcases the
and the cuff links, of course, so you get
cuff links are popping, the shirts and ties
they have to. Everything else is in black-and-white.
Yes!
we want to take the focus
off the very good-looking people that we'll have in this shot
and put it on the clothing.
so I figured, black-and-white for the nonimportant parts
and vivid color for the clothing we're showing off.
I think it'll be eye-catching.
I think it'll be original.
it'll look frickin' swanky.
Yeah.
there are three things that men want.
Yeah. The money, power, sex?
and Mr. Trump bespeaks all three of those.
Absolutely.
this is Mr. Trump's baby.
these are his shirts. This is his tie.
when I think of Trump products,
it's power, it's wealth, it's sexual prowess.
how about, like, tying in a story?
like, as you open the pages, it just kind of leads you
into, like, this guy's life. I don't know...
he's at work. He goes out to a nightclub.
I was thinking the morning-after scene.
Yeah, yeah. That's exactly right.
like, the woman wearing the men's shirt.
see, that's exactly what I was thinking.
and the man on the bed, taking the woman over. Yeah.
you know, something very sexual.
as project manager,
I just wanted to do something that pushed the envelope.
and I think the idea of a woman wearing a man's dress shirt
is sort of unexpected -- certainly, in a Macy's ad.
I don't even mind having the words "power," "sex," "wealth."
I don't actually like using the word "sex,"
no, I don't think
I think we're gonna convey them in a way without saying the words.
I think that's the way to go.
when the team was throwing the word "sex" out,
every time I would hear it, I felt kind of, "is that appropriate?" you know?
I really didn't feel like sex
was part of the Donald Trump signature collection.
it was his name on this brand.
and so we really have to be careful how we portray his image.
I think it's so sexy, you guys.
I'm really excited about it.
you know, maybe in the bed will be more appropriate
Yes.
I don't know if the bedroom is really what
Mr. Trump is looking for, so I was like, "oh, my god."
and later...
go over to the table, if you could.
all right, man. No problem. Just go. Thanks.
I'll drop you like a sack of
so, we're just dropping us off.
you're getting out, and we're heading home.
our task is to create a 4-page magazine advertisement for the Donald Trump signature collection at Macy's.
So,Clint and Liza were going to run a few errands,
and Brandy and I were gonna be dropped off
at Trump soho to get started on the photo shoot.
Hi, this is Steuart from Octane.
good. We don't see anybody here.
we're in the -- we're in the lobby.
and no models.
before we left for the Trump soho,
we called the modeling agency
and told them to send over our models.
well, there are no models.
Yeah, we're on the main floor,
and there's not a single person here.
they knew that we were under such a time deadline
that we just weren't gonna be able to get the shots done
if we didn't have some models.
okay?
I think I'm a pretty good-looking guy,
so I don't think Mr. Trump
is gonna have an issue with me being the featured actor,
so to speak, in this advertisement.
so, we're having a little issue here.
right now, Brandy and I are gonna shoot the bedroom scene.
we're gonna keep this pretty simplistic,
and we're gonna utilize the models in the other scenes.
the model has to be, uh,
you know, the legs are gonna have to be really something.
she has beautiful... you know, stunning.
I got to admit, I've never looked at Brandy's legs, though.
okay. She has
all right, I'm told that she has good legs.
I'm sure Steuart
had to have his arm twisted halfway up his back
to where he finally had to say, "oh, well."
the models aren't here. I guess I'll be the model.
there is a lot of risk
for them to be models in their own ad campaign.
that could come back to bite us.
this is not how I wanted this to go.
Oh, here are some of our models.
Oh, our models. Hello.
we were assigned 12 models.
and from those 12, we could pick 6 models.
you guys want to start, you know,
wearing some of these clothes, just seeing how they look?
but the actual first one through the door
had the look we were looking for.
I liked it. It was regal. It was youthful.
I think he's great. I think he's definitely...
I mean, I just imagine pulling his hair to the side.
so do I. Here, check him out.
I like him.
I mean, I don't even care who else comes in the door.
so, you want him front page?
I want front page. All right.
Oh, yeah. Congratulations. You're gonna be on the front page.
Oh, nice.
david had made a decision,
when he saw that first model walk in the door,
that this was gonna be the face of our advertorial.
Yeah, he's awesome.
david seems to have some man-crush on this model,
because he was all over this guy from the moment he walked in.
I love your look. You're the star of my show.
out of all the models, like,
not a single model's in the lobby.
good thing you're cute, huh?
what's going on? How are you?
good. Real good. Is everything well?
Wow! hey, look at this.
we don't have any models, so we're playing house.
Hey, you're both good-looking people, right?
it's great to see Brandy
take the initiative and actually be in the ad.
I think the risk she ultimately faces
is the fact that she's spending
more time getting hair and makeup done
and less time actually making sure
that everybody else is doing their jobs.
we're gonna kind of get a little risqu?
and he's gonna have his hand on her thigh
so that we can see the cuff link very clearly.
and then the next is,
they're gonna be waking up in a room together,
and she's gonna be wearing his shirt.
and that's what we're gonna shoot right now.
the one concern I really have is that it's too racy.
I think they have to think of the whole trump corporation,
as opposed to just what they're doing in this message.
if they really go over the edge, I think it might be too much.
Anthony, throw this on for me just real quick to see
just so I can get an image with you.
Ohh! how dapper can you be.
eyes to me.
that looks good! that looks really good.
it looks great.
thank god I have stephanie on the team.
Stephanie seemed to get my vision.
I think it was clear for her.
Anand, you have to see this.
did you -- yeah.
you know, it just felt really good
to have that reassurance from a fellow teammate,
and stephanie gave me that.
love it.
God, he's good, though, isn't he?
I think -- I mean, his neck is too small...
is that a problem with any of these other guys?
what about this guy in the pink?
much to my dismay, the shirt didn't even fit the model.
but with a face like that, do you think I can lose?
let's hope not.
we were working with several models
who did fit a lot of the shirts that we had.
but David just was so in love with this guy,
and thought that he was the perfect man for the cover,
that David didn't care, and he wouldn't listen to anybody.
he's a good-looking man.
like I said, if I didn't have all these kids,
you know, might go gay.
I can either be in a Trump shirt,
like, looking through ties...
Yeah, you should be, like, picking out your tie.
our concept is a day in the life of a Trump-type man.
he wakes up with this woman, he goes to the boardroom,
and then he goes to happy hour at night.
when I originally saw it in my mind,
I saw, like, a really tall, skinny model.
I didn't see my stubby legs sticking out of the bottom.
but that's why, you know,
maybe in the bed might be just more appropriate? Yes.
we didn't have any models when we needed to start shooting,
so Steuart and I had to step in and act as the faux models
in order to get this task done.
we look like people that others can relate with,
and I do think it was the right decision.
you're... you're flirting by not looking at him.
everything just worked out really nice last night,
whatever happened.
I am a really conservative person.
and the photographer was trying
to get me to make these sexy looks,
and I just didn't think -- I was, like, giggling.
looking over at your lover.
Mm-hmm.
I didn't even shave my legs. I was wearing granny panties.
it was so embarrassing.
get a little smirk, like, "hmm, yeah, something nice, yeah."
checking in?
Oh, perfect, yeah. We need that. Thank you.
we're going to the 20th floor.
Clint and I were out shopping,
so I haven't actually been able to see the shoot going on.
show me some teeth.
there. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
I don't know if the bedroom
is really what mr. Trump is looking for, so I was like, "oh, my god," you know?
I did not like that.
update, please.
david sent anand and I to do some photography at trump bar,
because we wanted to really integrate the Trump brand.
now -- what? You guys didn't order food?
we didn't have time.
I tasked Anand and Poppy
with the "simple" job of getting food for their models.
I begged them, begged them, begged them to order lunch.
begged them.
poppy and Anand said that they didn't find food,
that they couldn't go to the food court.
blah-blah blah, blah-blah, blah-blah.
I don't care. Figure it out.
hello.
sorry, I'm on the phone, trying to get food for everyone.
no problem, no problem.
how are you? It's a late lunch.
it's almost 5: 00. I know.
we were -- we were at trump tower. Mm-hmm.
it's past 5: 00 right now,
and they're still dealing with ordering lunch for the models.
if your models aren't happy, that could create a problem for them.
you guys were responsible for the models.
they're sitting around being like, "where's my food?
and it's just like -- it's not working.
david decided
to completely harp on us about the lunches for the models.
the food just showed up?
Yeah. Not so good.
so, what do you want us to do now?
do you want us to entertain the models...
I want you to entertain the models.
I don't really know what bug went up his ass,
because it was awful, the way he was treating us.
Hey,Poppy, go back over there, please.
anand can do that himself.
okay.
I like that one.
her Vodka's in the picture. That's a good one.
I like that a lot.
Yeah, I like that one.
we have to start picking photos.
and, you know, I really kind of felt like
it's maybe a little too much.
you know, the hand on the thigh
and, you know, the bedroom scene.
it was just more "sex" stuff than I would have done.
we just -- we can't, man.
I love it.
we're gonna do models on the back, too?
can I propose this to you?
having the "T" come down
and have just product, no people.
so it would be shirt, tie product, cuff-link product
okay.
we're making the back page in the shape of a "T"
to really get that trademark branding in there,
that it is trump signature wear that we're selling.
I think that one is okay. I don't really like
well, this is not gonna work, because we have the camera guy.
we can take him out.
you know, that -- that was a
that was during the day or...
all right, uh, hey. Okay.
when I -- dude, I'm just tell-- listen.
just hold on. I haven't seen these yet.
I'm telling you -- I'm telling you which ones
were actually in the moment
and which ones we're actually giving them direction, all right?
let me go through them and look at them myself
without any interpretation and see what I think,
and then you point out the ones you like.
I was enjoying the pictures for the first time.
I wanted to make my own decision of what I liked.
wait. So, why do you want to use this one?
I-I wasn't...
I didn't want someone over my shoulder saying, "oh, that one's great, that one's great!"
I want to find what's great for myself.
I'm not pointing out anything I like.
you're picking them.
go over to the table, if you could.
all right, man. No problem. Just go. Thanks.
I'll drop you like a sack of
if you touch me again.
I hate that mother I'm so sorry. I can tell.
I hate him. He's a piece of
anyway. All right.
you know, I tried to give him the input,
being that I was there and he wasn't,
and he refused to listen, so, finally, I said, "you know what, you're the project manager."
you can go burning in flames.
he's got to go. It's as simple as that.
I'm trying to get a job with Mr. Trump.
and I can tell you one thing.
Mr. Trump is not in the business of rehabbing a lost cause,
and that's what David is.
want to try it again right from here?
here, the consumer is able to identify
with Donald Trump the businessman.
today we're gonna be presenting
to Mr. Trump's brand executive
and also an executive from Macy's.
there's a lot of pressure here,
because this is Mr. Trump's baby.
we got to hit our presentation right on the nose.
we got to be right on the money.
let's go, team.
good morning, Ms. Glosser and Mr. Lundgren.
team Octane is proud
to present a 4-page promotional advertising layout for the Donald Trump shirts, ties, and cuff links
sold exclusively at Macy's.
the team agreed that I would be the one
to do the presentation, because I had been singled out
as a good speaker by Mr. Trump in a previous task.
but I was really nervous.
I could hear my voice shaking a bit.
here, a strong male figure is getting ready
to take on his busy day
while his wife or girlfriend lounges playfully in the bedroom
as if the two enjoyed a romantic evening on -- on the
and a night on the town the evening before.
in the next shot, we see our alpha male again
with his buddies smartly dressed
in the trump signature collection
apparel and acc-- accessories.
with his hand resting gently on her thigh,
we see a self-assured man who commands respect.
as she plays with his tie,
we also appreciate the great attention to detail
that is a hallmark of the Trump signature collection.
thank you very much for your presentation.
great. Thank you so much.
I am the one to blame if we lose on this task.
and I really want to stay in the game.
I really love my team, and, hopefully, we succeeded.
hello.
Hi.
thank you for having us.
I decided to go with a...
"let the clothing speak for itself" theme.
so we decided to mute down the tone of our models
and bring out the clothing so that we could see
what is important to the businessman.
and it is clothing.
I like to just go
and let it all out without rehearsing.
think of what you want to say and just let it go.
I wanted to make the feel of the 20s, if you will,
when the youth could change the shape of America.
I am so proud of what I've created,
I just wanted to show it off.
we also wanted to highlight, you know, the looks.
we shaped it kind of as the symbol of Mr. Trump, with a "T."
I just want to say, you know, in closing,
thank you for letting us work
with a great product and a great company like Macy's.
terrific. Thank you.
thank you very much. Thanks.
let's talk about Octane's presentation.
first of all, the brochure.
I thought the creativity here really demonstrated the points
that they were trying to make about the brand.
I was a little bit concerned.
I thought this first page of the ad,
with the woman lying on the bed,
could be a little bit racy for the brand.
right, and as a store that sells to families,
you know, I'm always concerned about that subject.
I think that Brandy was very articulate.
but, a few times, Brandy did refer to the line
as the Trump signature collection.
it is called the Donald J Trump signature collection.
so, let's talk about Fortitude.
David's actual presentation was quite good.
Yes, very much so.
I actually like the way that they did the background
in black-and-white,
and it did make the product pop a little bit more.
right, right. The colors really come through with that background.
but what bothers me, these models do not fit the clothes.
this guy's neck is too small for this shirt on the front page here.
I was interested in their "T" design.
however, I didn't love
that their product shots were very small.
too small. Details missing.
so we've got a lot of pros and cons.
and now we're gonna have to make the final decision.
but they both did a great job, both teams,
and I think it's gonna be tough.
brandy, how were you as a project manager?
do you feel you were, like, a winner?
I think that our pictorial layout is beautiful.
and yet you were in the ad.That was
do you think you look beautiful in the ad?
it was a little uncomfortable for me
to get behind the camera, but -- well, let me ask you this.
you were also in front of the camera, right? That's true.
didn't I see you in the shirt -- the trump shirt?
you did, sir. We really wanted
to showcase the sexuality of the Trump brand
and put it in an eye-catching manner.
and by placing the shirt on a woman,
we think we accomplished just that.
Liza, what do you think of Brandy? What did you think?
brandy did an amazing job.
I mean, I had no doubt, going into this task,
that when she was project manager
that we would have a good leader.
okay, good.
Yes, sir?
did you miss David?
I think we got a great team, sir.
I think we got a great team now.
a better team with or without David?
uh, I think that these two ladies have brought
some amazing insight and some amazing tools to our team
that we grossly lacked.
and what about steuart? I heard he was a model.
he was a model. Was he a good model?
well, he, uh, embodied what I think
is the -- the Trump attribute.
Yes, sir, I think he did a good job.
what is the Trump attribute?
that is, uh, wealth, power, and sexual prowess.
the last one is the most important above all.
without that, it doesn't matter. You do know that?
I understand that.
sir.
talk to me, David.
I will talk to you, sir.
what are you liking about what you did?
I like everything about what we did.
I'm very proud of our end result.
who is your -- oh, I see you're wearing the ties.
Yes, sir. Let me just -- oh!
lookee. Lookee what we have. Poppy, that's very nice.
thank you. Stephanie, very nice.
thank you. I love it.
Stephanie, what do you think of David?
you know, coming into this, I was unsure,
just because of the history and what we've seen.
boy, this is gonna be a train wreck.
however, I must say, he is a definite personality.
that's for sure. He's eccentric.
he's very dynamic.
but I really enjoyed meshing with the men,
because it brought new energy.
that's interesting.
so, David, who was your weakest player?
you know, this is a very tough question to answer,
because 90% of this task was mine.
I feel like I shouldered most of it.
so it's hard to say "weak."
I know, as far as limited involvement,
poppy had the least involvement.
was that because of you or because of poppy?
there was some miscommunication.
I delegated a job to her and Anand.
and I hate to call her Poppy "the Puppy,"
but it just seemed like she would follow anand around
on the task I gave them together.
poppy, how do you respond to that?
I was actually
talked to and spoken to in a very demeaning way.
by who?
project manager. Yes.
I see. How did he speak to you?
when anand and I were working
on the final page of the presentation,
which, I might add, was entirely my creation,
he came up to me,
because the food for the models wasn't there yet.
and he came up to me and said, "stop messing with the ties."
your job is to entertain the models.
correct.
what do you mean by "entertain the models"?
who gives a about the models?
I mean -- thank you. They're getting paid to be models.
you don't have to entertain models.
it wasn't just to entertain.
I tasked Anand and Poppy with the job
of dressing the models, feeding the models,
taking them from place to place.
none of it was done by Poppy.
I picked the models myself. She did not.
I did not task her with doing -- I
I picked five of the six models.
that's not true.
what is true, anand?
well, David's making the claim
that he picked all of the models.
he picked one model in particular,
and it was very, like, homoerotic what I saw.
I picked five out of six.
it was very, very surprising, to be honest with you.
what does that mean?
the moment he saw this one model,
who's the cover of our -- of our advertisement,
david just had this ridiculous man-crush on this guy
and was just all goo-goo-gaga over this guy.
it was very odd. It was very odd.
David, are you gay?
not at all, sir. Not...
I wasn't insinuating that.
Oh, my god.
well, I think you might have been insinuating it.
but the guy has five kids. I don't know.
it happens.
you never know. And who cares, right, David?
I know guys who were married for 20 years that left with a guy.
I mean, they liked a guy, so, you know.
right, David? But that's not you?
that's not me, sir, no.
are you sure you don't want to come out?
I know guys who were married for 20 years that left with a guy.
I mean, they liked a guy, so, you know.
right, David? But that's not you?
that's not me, sir, no.
are you sure you don't want to come out?
I'm also sure I'm not coming out.
but, Anand, you're not saying David's gay, are you?
not that there's anything wrong with that, Mr. Trump.
you know?
no, no. I think it's fine.
I mean, what do I say?
I mean, I'm not gay, damn it!
the model -- the model was fantastic.
I mean, you look at his picture...
David, David. ...he's the man.
David, David, that sounds pretty gay.
maybe you were trying it out.
okay.
I'd like to see the two ads.
please show them the ad.
swap them.
done.
this doesn't look like up-and-coming professionals.
all right. This is over.
I do not like that at all.
I can't do that.
we talked about that, and we said "no.
poppy, which ad do you like better?
I like the product placement
of the Trump Vodka
and other Trump items in the Octane ad.
Yeah.
however...
the one thing that sets our ad apart
is our actual
the coloring and the last page,
that we have everything featured.
right. Product information. And explicitly featured.
Mm-hmm. And I think that is very important.
okay.
Clint, how do you feel about their ad?
it leaves me wanting, compared to our ad.
I think our ad hits all the points,
made more points than their ad did.
do you mind the fact that the shirt's
about nine sizes too big for the model that David's so in love with?
it -- that -- it looks -- that's something I don't like there.
I mean, the model
I know you think he's great,
but he's obviously got a very small neck.
did you have a shirt that fit?
I mean, we make them in all different sizes.
so why did you pick a shirt that's about, I would say,
two or three sizes too big for the model?
I'll answer that.
go ahead.
if Anand and I were permitted a little bit more jurisdiction
in the task that we were assigned,
we wouldn't have taken models with such small necks.
but, poppy, did you ever actually protest the model to david?
she did, she did.
okay.
just out of curiosity, Brandy,
you know, it seems to me that you've been very prudish.
you know, you don't like the outward-sex thing
and all that stuff, although you're beautiful.
how did you feel doing that ad?
a little risqu? Isn't it?
we didn't have any models arrive at the.
and if I had not made the decision
for Steuart and I to be in the photo,
then we wouldn't have made our deadline.
so I think it was 100% the right choice.
are you having an affair with Steuart?
no, sir. Would you like to?
no, I would not, sir. I like older men, sir.
Oh. Oh.
that was a very smart...
you're hired!
brandy, you can head back to the suite.
okay.
let's find out who won.
Yes, sir.
you think you won, David, right?
I have a lot riding on winning, so...
well, do you think you won?
I still do.
well, you didn't.
Terry preferred Brandy's team.
good job.
and, frankly...
he's going to use the ad in a major Macy's campaign.
awesome.
he thought it was great work.
he thought it was imaginative.
he thought it was beautiful.
and he really felt very strongly,
and there's nobody like Terry Lundgren.
so I want to congratulate you, Brandy, and your team.
thank you, sir.
and as your award -- and I think it's fantastic,
because he is the king
you're going to meet with Terry Lundgren...
that's too wonderful.
...the head of Macy's, and you're gonna spend some time with him.
and if you learn just a little bit of what he knows,
you're gonna be very successful.
thank you so much, sir. Thank you. Okay?
Congratulations. Go back to your suite.
you can watch on television if you like.
thank you.
thank you, Don.
good job, guys.
it's a new team.
I can't believe it.
the rest of you, stay here.
somebody will be fired.
David, that's very disappointing.
I thought your ad was very disappointing.
I thought your choice of the model was disappointing,
not because he's a bad-looking guy
he's a great-looking guy
but I thought the worst thing in the whole deal
was the size of the shirt
not fitting properly around the neck.
what do you say?
when you create something
and run it cradle to grave...
and you take ownership and you stand by something,
I have to absorb all the criticism as it is,
and it's all mine.
poppy, did you want to choose a different model, right?
Yes. Why didn't you?
david was extremely firm,
and it was more like a dictatorship,
rather than a leadership.
but that's okay, 'cause he's the project manager.
but sometimes, David, you have to listen to people.
never was there a suggestion to me
of, "let's use this."
and I even had backup from stephanie, saying, "oh, yeah, he's our guy."
I know.
don't go down that road, virus.
maybe he can get Stephanie to lie in this boardroom.
I did like that model, because he was the tall
he was the biggest, the tallest.
he was like 6'2." He was very big.
but, you know, in the shoulder ad, like,
you don't really see the tallness.
right, but I didn't
I thought a guy that big will fit in the shirts.
well... I mean, he seemed like a big guy.
poppy, you were very proud of the last page,
with the small pictures and the tie,
and yet that's what terry liked the least.
Mm-hmm.
why shouldn't I fire you?
what I was proud about was the fact
that we discussed the product and what it is about.
the photos that Anand and I took
had a lot more product placement in them,
and david chose to not even consult anyone.
I didn't cho-- I didn't cho-- I didn't choose any product photos at all.
it was your task. You did the back page solely.
you picked the photos of the cuff links,
the photos of the shirts.
Stephanie, is that right? Hold it. Is that right or not?
the back page
was the products page that they provided, yes.
it was for the product.
so, could you see me firing Poppy?
not in this case, sir, unfortunately, no.
I think that it's -- it's sad,
but I think David had a great vision,
but this was really his vision, and he made the decisions.
but what do you mean, "unfortunately," I shouldn't fire Poppy?
you said that before.
well, I said, unfortunate for David is that
right. What do you mean by that?
well, this was all his.
it was 90% his, as he stated,
so he made all the decisions.
I see. So you're just saying
the word "unfortunately" as it related to David.
to David. Yeah. Okay. I get it.
should I fire Poppy?
absolutely not, sir.
you know, David put Poppy and I in charge
of doing the photo shoot.
he gave us a vision, and we hit a home run with it.
he wanted us to actually shoot a scene at the Trump bar,
utilizing every single one of our models,
showing a variety of ties, shirts, cuff links.
that was David? That was David.
but isn't that a good concept?
it's a great concept.
but where david screwed up
was, when we came back and we were very excited
about the photographs that we had taken,
I sat David down and I said, "David, come check this out. We've got some great photos."
david shunned me away.
I did.
very simple.
Why? I wanted a fresh look at all the photos.
we should be able to give input.
I mean, this is a team effort. Do you agree that -- no.
you picked a photograph that didn't show
it only showed two models.
it showed three. Two similar-colored ties.
three models.
and one of them was a woman.
it adds to the mood, and it sets
were there any comments on the middle page?
you picked a photograph that didn't show
any of the Trump vodka, any of the
I'm not selling Trump vodka. I'm selling shirts, ties.
but one of the concepts that we were being graded on
was brand integration, and you picked the one photo
that didn't have any brand integration at all.
also, the page on the back,
we actually needed to put all the models in there
and as much product as possible,
because we were, at that point,
only showing three shirts with the first three pages.
poppy, but the pictures were this big.
agreed, agreed, and that is
you couldn't even see product in them, they were so small.
I agree, I agree. That is something that
but that was your decision.
all right. David, I want you to let one person go.
so, tell me, who is the person
that least deserves to be fired on your team.
uh, uh, Anand.
anand -- yes.
so, you're going to keep Stephanie instead of Anand?
I am. Yes.
Mm-hmm.
it's not for any other reason than we collaborated together,
and we were kind of in agreeance with this
through the whole thing.
I got a lot of support from Stephanie.
and when I have a wingman who gives me their, "you got it, this is great,"
and I hear, "you should fire David, not Poppy,"When Poppy did nothing, it's ridiculous.
all right. Anand, go back to the suite.
thank you, Mr. Trump.
excuse me.
Stephanie, sit down next to Poppy, please.
good luck, guys.
thank you.
Stephanie, can the case be made that I should fire you?
no, I don't believe so, sir.
can that case be made,Poppy? Should I fire Stephanie?
I honestly believe that David
is the person to be fired, sir.
you know, David, as a project manager, you taken a big rick
Yes, sir.
because if you look at the great history of "the apprentice..." mm-hmm.
...a project manager just -- it's tough.
Yes, sir. If you lose,
the chances are you're not gonna do as well as everybody else,
and you understand that.
you know, I guess, if my first three pages
were good enough to maybe squeak by,
and the killer was the last page
I had no creative input at all.
I let them run with it.
but you do know that, as the project manager...
I do, sir. ...if you didn't love the last page,
you could have said, look, Poppy, let's make the pictures bigger.
let's make something else.
you could have done a lot of other things, right? That I could, sir.
we also had other photos that were magnificent
that Anand and I had taken,
and those could have been taken in place.
are you talking product photos or people photos?
people photos.
you were very adamant, and everyone was in agreeance,
that product needed to be put on the back.
Yeah, but she can't be adamant, because you're the boss. Agreed.
are you the boss? I am the boss.
David, you're fired.
can I say something?
Yes. It has been a pleasure.
I appreciate, you know, from all of you, the time of my life.
so, Mr. Trump, sir, thank you very much. -Thank you, David.
good job. Mr. Trump, thank you very much.
you've done yourself proud. Now get the hell out of here.
thank you, as well.
Hey, goodbye.
you did great, okay?
so did you.
you're a gentleman, David.
thank you, guys. Good luck. All right. Thank you.
Hello, sir. How's it going?
it's been better. I'll just say that.
down, please.
well, the risk goes with being project manager.
we had no choice.
you know, based on the circumstance,
I don't think Mr. Trump had any other option than to fire me.
I was project manager. I took ownership of it.
there's a few things I could have done different.
and looking back, I can't change anything about it.
woulda, shoulda, couldas. And, you know, I didn't.
rockport presents "next steps."
now that "the apprentice" is over, I have focus.
I've started my own company. I control my own destiny.
you know, Donald Trump is a great businessman,
and he does it, and he's built himself to what he is today.
the teams were tasked with creating a commercial for flow TV and AT&T.
today you'll be working with two great companies. Good luck.
on Fortitude,
project manager Stephanie sidelined Liza.
so imagine, like, it's, like, a mom like me at a park with her kids.
I want to stick with my concept, which was the office setting.
it was literally,I'm hearing what you're saying, but I don't care.
and she continued to undervalue her.
what about a stadium, like outside?
I called chester stadium.
they're not gonna let us in till 4: 00, so forget it.
I can't rely on Liza for anything substantial.
octane was off to a rocky start.
maybe two guys are leaning together
on the cubicle, watching -- yes! yes! he scored!
I'm not 100% sold.
let's go with it. We don't have anything better.
and when things finally got rolling...
Hey, I got an idea,Steuart.
this whole scene is awesome. We can't break that scene up.
...Brandy felt left behind.
I played a very marginalized role in this project.
in the boardroom, there was a clear winner.
the executives felt that Steuart did a fantastic commercial,
and you absolutely won.
that left Stephanie and Liza to slug it out.
and I felt as though I was a team of one.
we lost because of the concept.
and the concept we talked -- because we had no other location...
the concept had nothing to do with the location.
...than a white table and a white room.
Liza came under fire.
you're very vocal in the boardroom,
but you don't seem to be that strong out in the field.
but Mr. Trump had made up his mind.
you're the project manager,
and you also admitted to me before
that the concept was your concept.
Stephanie, you're fired.
go. Thank you.
and Mr. Trump had a message for Liza.
and, Liza, I was not happy with you one bit.
okay.
you'd better get your act together.
I will. Thank you. Go.
we really did a good job, guys.
I'm so proud of us.
Cheers, guys. Three fun victories.
you guys, that's pretty amazing!
think about our team.
we only haven't won three times,
and there's been three reasons why we haven't.
they've all been people who wouldn't listen to us.
I mean, we have done a great job.
the men are definitely trying to one-up each other.
you can describe the men
as one giant measuring competition.
they're definitely trying to position themselves
as the alpha male of the group.
how about that? Come back to Crystal champagne.
it's Cristal.
I don't care what you call it -- Cristal champagne. It's awesome.
we upped your sophistication level.
I don't make any apologies for where I come from,
that's for sure.
I'm just a hick from the sticks.
no, shut up. Oh, man.
Clint is a great, great guy,
but I just don't think Clint is a New York guy.
you know, that's one of the things I have on Clint.
you know, you've got to have a savviness
about what you do and how you do it.
and I think I provide that.
Oh, here they come.
Liza. Yes.
Liza. I knew it!
final four, Liza.
I cannot believe that I'm in the final four.
I've just been fighting the whole time,
and I really feel like a lot of people underestimate me.
and what I need to fight for is my reputation,
which is that I am a hard worker.
I just have to make Mr. Trump see that.
and there's no other way to do that
than to step up as project manager.
you know, the cream rises to the top, though.
that's what happens.
good evening.
Hello, Mr. Trump.
wow, this is going to be very interesting
the final four.
well, here's what I'm going to do
start by breaking up the teams.
brandy, you and Liza are a team.
good luck, girls.
so we're back to men versus women.
okay.
okay.
Yes, sir.
definitely.
tomorrow morning, you'll be getting on two helicopters.
you'll be flown to West Chester, Pennsylvania,
where you'll be working at QVC...
...one of the great multimedia retailers
anywhere in the world.
all right, you'll pick your products,
you'll sell your products,
and the one that makes the most profit will win.
Clint, who's gonna be your project manager?
you're looking at him, sir. I'm gonna take the helm.
once it gets down to the final four, the game has changed.
you start looking at yourself
and how you can put yourself in the best light
and how I can show Mr.Trump the CEO That I really AM.
who's going to be your project manager, Liza?
I'm gonna be the project manager, Mr.Trump.
whoa, whoa! you're stepping up! yes, I am, Mr. Trump.
how do you feel about that, Brandy?
I feel very excited.
historically, Liza has not been a strong leader.
if the two of us have to go into the boardroom
in that she's fought for herself several times over.
so if we lose the test, then,
you know, the claws have to come out.
well, my advisers will be
Juan Betancourt and Catherine Roman
as you know are great headhunters.
Wow. Okay. Enjoy your day.
thank you.
well, ladies... okay.
good luck to you, ladies.-- Okay. Good luck.
Bye, Team Fortitude.
Yes. Whatever.
one, two, three.
Octane! Octane!
Hey. Final two.
Steuart, welcome.
I've been looking forward to seeing you, to meeting you.
great. Thank you.
I won the last task,
and I get to meet with Cathy Black,
the chairman of Hearst magazines.
and obviously, they're one of the oldest media conglomerates
in the United States.
so, you've been an entrepreneur.
that's something I've never done. I have.
started four companies, had two that didn't do so great.
it's an interesting business climate today.
we closed a couple of magazines, as well... --yeah, I heard.
and that's not easy.
and we put people out of work.
but we all learned from that.
you know, what we learned is that in this economy,
in the world today, in this changing media culture,
that we had to do it with a much smaller team.
it's tough. It is. It's tough.
whenever I hear about somebody starting a business,
I say, keep your overhead low.
our industry has to learn to operate
in a more nimble and flexible manner.
so, that's just something that might think about as you go forward.
there were a couple key points
I took away from my meeting with Cathy.
instead of maybe getting bigger,
take what you have and make it better,
keeping our overhead low, but making sure
we're as effective as possible.
Steuart, it's been great to meet you.
I'm delighted to have hosted you here at Hearst.
thank you so much for having me.
it was a pleasure. You bet.
qvc, here we come.
Oh, my god.
I thought about it last night,
why I think that we get along so well together.
and you're about a 20-year-younger version...
of your dad! ...of my dad ...with a little country twang. Okay, good.
and I think that's why I like you so much.
you guys have a very similar outlook
if you get out of line, I'm gonna spank you.
Steuart had a freudian slip.
he told me I reminded him of his father.
and you know what?
friends or not, I'm the tall hog at this trough,
and Steuart is just somebody else I'm gonna have to root out.
I want to do a blowfish on that window.
he is absolutely too immature to be the apprentice.
we're gonna have to figure out what we're gonna sell,
how much we're gonna sell it for,
and then just get to selling it.
during the helicopter ride, I thought to myself, the men are probably strategizing,
and Liza and I are sitting here quiet.
I know that Steuart and Clint
very much are like a back-and-forth operation,
and I felt that Liza and I
didn't necessarily operate that way.
thank you, sir.
so I was definitely worried
because I obviously want us to win.
I don't want to go home,
and I want to, quite frankly, like, deflate the boys' ego.
Hi. How are you doing?
Hi. I'm David Miller. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you. I'm Liza Wisner. Welcome.
are you familiar with QVC at all?
I think my mom and my wife
might own a wing around here somewhere.
our task this week is to pick a product and sell it on QVC.
and whoever has the highest profit margin wins.
then we have a very little bit of time
to negotiate the products with Fortitude.
so we're gonna take you through the product
that you guys will get to touch, feel, price,
hopefully sell well and hopefully win the task, so...
it's all Isaac Mizrahi merchandise.
and Isaac's known for color.
and, of course, there's always pink somewhere throughout the line.
the first item up is a pebble leather Isaac Mizrahi bag,
and it's fully lined with the Isaac logo.
and the minimum QVC price on this would be $108.
QVC's minimum amount is kind of like our cost.
and anything we sell for over that is our profit.
this whole project is not about quantity.
it's about profit margin.
the next item is a leopard, faux-calf-hair, reversible belt.
and it comes one color way only.
and minimum price here would be $26.
all right, the next one.
this is a mother-of-pearl watch with the faux-croc wristband.
and the minimum QVC price is $30. 56.
Catherine and Juan,
who are Mr. Trump's eyes and ears, show up,
and pressure's on.
I mean, now it becomes very real very fast.
and the last item is the heritage print
or some people might call it a status print.
Yeah.
I know women love purses.
they're willing to pay a lot more money for purses.
and the thing I was looking for
was something that I could mark up and have a big profit margin.
but I didn't want the girls on Fortitude to know our strategy.
it is all stainless. That's good.
stainless on the back. Yes.
lot of detail.
after we heard about the products available to us,
we then broke off to discuss our strategy
going into the negotiation.
we had two things that we could negotiate for.
one was the product that we wanted,
and two was the time slot in which we would go on air.
Interestingly,Liza would ask Brandy
to give her more feedback, but brandy said, it's your call.
that's a very savvy, potentially manipulative way of saying
if they were to lose, well, that wasn't my decision.
that was your decision,Liza.
we had several things we wanted out of the negotiation.
obviously, we wanted the purse,
and we wanted the time slot we wanted.
we felt the later time slot was better
just because you have more time to prepare,
so we had a pretty crafty plan
to get the women to give us exactly what we wanted.
we were gonna have them duped from the beginning.
okay. Locked in, partner.
ladies, you want to talk a little bit, or are y'all ready?
all right, guys.
we'll just come over here and join you.
we have a couple items that we would be happy with.
we do, too.
and why don't you let us know your two items,
we'll let you know our two items,
and we'll see if we can come to an agreement?
let them know one.
Yeah.
we're thinking the... the belt.
okay.
and we're thinking one of ours is the watch.
what's your other one?
all right.
we're also thinking the watch.
Oh, okay, so belt and watch.
we're also thinking the belt. Yeah.
okay, so you got belt. Yeah, so.
so we're kind of on the same page.
okay.
also, remember, we also have some time slots
that we want to talk about. Yeah.
what is your preference on time?
how about you guys do that cause we did our preference first.
we would like to be last to present.
so, which is your number one?
is it the belt or the watch?
I got to tell you, to be honest with you,
if you would let us have first pick at the sales,
we'll let you have first pick at the products.
I got to tell you, to be honest with you,
if you would let us have first pick at the sales,
we'll let you have first pick at the products.
okay.
Clint and I had them in the palm of our hands.
we figured out how we were gonna trick them.
why they didn't pick up on what we were doing, I have no idea.
Liza come on!
like, you totally got duped, girl!
so, I guess we're gonna take the watch.
right.
okay.
and we're gonna be on air first.
exactly.
and you guys are taking the watch? Exactly.
all right, let's do it. We're done.
we're gonna do the purse.
the men got the time slot that they wanted,
and they did get the product that they wanted
and even more confidence going into the task,
which really was what pissed me off the most.
thank you.
thank you. Take care.
we got what we wanted. Mm-hmm.
Clint had a very clear strategy for what he was gonna do.
he allowed Liza to think
that she was getting what she wanted.
Clint dominated that negotiation.
okay, so they got the handbag,
which means they're not gonna have to sell as many as we sell.
but I have a feeling they're gonna have a harder time
marking that sucker up, cause it's already $100.
I was gonna tell you I can't believe that
that's what they're going for, but you know what?
you never know what they're thinking. Yep.
I don't know that the men are familiar
with how women shop, you know?
whenever I buy a handbag, I hem and haw about it.
it's a larger purchase for me.
okay. So this price is $30. 56.
do you think we could sell it for $60, $59. 95, double it?
I think that's, like, right smack in the middle
of what I was thinking.
$50 to $75.
what's your gut reaction? When would you say "too much"?
I would say we go with like $69-something.
$69. 95? Yeah, something like that.
I really wanted to make sure that the profit margin,
you know, would really be good for us,
but then, at the same time,
I really wanted to be pricing with the recession
and people not having a lot of money,
that they could make a quick decision and just buy, buy, buy.
then $69 it is.
$69. 95?
$69. 50.
so every time we sell one,
we'd be making basically a little less than $40.
Mm-hmm. But say they make their bag $200,
then we're gonna have to sell basically 3 watches
for every 1 bag that they sell.
you know what I mean? Mm-hmm.
all right.
Oh, if this comes back to price point, then...
so, I think what we need to do
is determine what our retail "value" price is gonna be.
Mm-hmm. And, uh...
I mean, this is both a shoulder bag and a clutch
I mean, you got the -- you can take it down to a clutch purse,
or you can take it up to a
and, look, this thing will extend way out
as a shoulder bag.
Hi, my name is Clint Robertson.
I love this purse.
I'd buy about 500 for my wife...
if I wasn't unemployed.
you know, it looks so
I mean, it's not gonna work on my arm, but, you know,
the thing about being able to open it,
keep a strap on your shoulder...
I can open this up and reach my bear paw in.
I mean, it's even a shoulder bag at the middle setting.
colors will go with anything.
can you open the purse like this when you hold it?
and I'm like...
what is wrong with you?
Steuart is the little brother I never wanted.
he's kind of wacky, kind of, you know, immature in a funny way.
but I want him to be focused, too.
let's look online for some purses.
all right. What are we gonna do about price?
$190 -- you know, $197. Higher.
you know, just an odd number.
you know, $199. 99, people all gonna go, "oh, well, that's just $200 in disguise.
people spend money on QVC.
both our butts are on the line here.
do you think that's enough?
if you feel like we could get more,
I wouldn't go above $250.
man, that's a 50% markup. We need to stay under $200.
well, yeah, I mean, I'm just saying...
that's a mental ledge for people.
for this?
Steuart was saying,you know,
why don't we think about maybe going $250?
but I don't want to cross that $200 threshold in this economy.
I think $194. 97. That's $64. 99 3 months.
we also have to make it easy 420
for ladies to pay this purse over time.
the three-easy-pay installment plan that QVC offers
is a great plan, and we're gonna take full advantage of it.
$194. 97 is our price.
with three easy pays.
divided by three. With 3 easy pays of $64. 99.
coming up...
hold this up kind of like this,
and dangle it like it's an earring.
do you want me to finger it?
man. My kids are gonna be watching this.
and later...
who's gonna be my guest?
I'm African-American, and she's Caucasian.
so I would actually say
that I think I would prefer if you did the presentation.
Hello, team Octane.
hello. How are you doing? I'm well.
Gabrielle. Gabrielle, I'm Clint Robertson. Nice to see you.
nice to meet you. This is Steuart.
so, Gabrielle is the on-air host,
the face everybody knows.
one of us has to be the guest host
to sell these purses on camera with Gabrielle.
and one of us has to be the director
and run the whole show.
what would you like to know, as far as...
well, right now, we're determining
which one of us are gonna present. Okay.
we both have really good sales.
you know, it's all about having a conversation with the host.
right. Right.
so it's friendly, like we're just having a conversation,
and the viewers are eavesdropping.
you know, when we first met, I said, you know, this guy is the pretty boy down here.
I would send him out to sell,
and I would run -- I'd run everything from back.
you've already got the Isaac Mizrahi pink on.
but...
...do you think you can get out there
and look into that camera and be real yeah.
and talk about the coziness of the purse, talk about the
you know, the bag itself?
if you can do that, then you're the guy.
I mean, there's no question I can.
I look like maybe I could work for Isaac Mizrahi, perhaps.
Clint would never be working for Isaac Mizrahi.
he's not very sophisticated and cultured
in the sense of living that metropolitan lifestyle.
I think we've got our answer.
it's gonna be Steuart.
me and you on air, Steuart.
all right. Very good. All right. Good deal.
and you know what?
I'd really hold this up kind of like this, you know,
when you're talking about this
and dangle it like it's an earring.
and, you know, we consider this our bag jewelry.
Yeah.
do you want me to finger it?
use a -- what in the world kind of a word is that?
man. My kids are gonna be watching this.
I really need steuart to be focusing.
his age shows a lot of times.
but we've got to keep pressing for our goal,
and I'm not gonna lose sight of the finish line.
all right, when you get out there,
make sure these things are set up nicely.
you know, get everything set out right, really nice-looking.
Hey, can we move on to the next subject?
God, I feel dirty even touching it now.
what have I gotten myself into?
tell me what you love.
I love the colors.
okay. And then also, it has, like, a modern feel.
I'd say modern and timeless.
right. That's a good one. You know, modern and timeless.
albany, our on-air host came to meet with us for the first time,
and she really helped clarify
kind of what we should be thinking about going forward.
who's gonna be my guest?
what do you want to do? Well, you're the PM.
okay, so US Demographics are female...
Mm-hmm.
85% Caucasian, 7% African-American.
cause obviously,
I'm African-American, and she's Caucasian.
okay.
so I would actually say
that I think I would prefer if you did the presentation.
all right.
so, if you don't mind doing that part.
Yeah, no, I'll do whatever you want.
you're the boss.
I really wanted to push Liza to be a leader,
to make decisions, but at the same time,
she was very much focusing on bizarre things.
and I think when she brought up the race point,
at that point, I was just like,oh, my gosh.
this is so ridiculous.
Hi.
one of you's John. Hi, I'm John.
you're John? Hi, I'm Liza.
Liza, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too.
Oh, my gosh! I feel like I need glasses.
you'll get used to it after a few minutes.
this is crazy.
it was like, whoa! you know?
there must have been like 100 screens and colors and buttons,
and it was just crazy, and people with headsets.
I mean, I wanted to run.
give you a quick crash course on how to produce.
okay.
it's very bright.
Yeah.
so, there's headsets right there. Okay.
have you put those on. The other way.
Oh. Okay. The microphone is in the front.
before we went live, we had a short time to rehearse,
but because we were the first time slot,
I just felt like the time was not enough.
you just let me know when you're ready to start.
all right. Let's do it.
welcome back to "Isaac Mizrahi live"!
I'm Albany Irvin, and I'd love to introduce you to Brandy.
you are...
okay. I feel like you're both covering
that Isaac Mizrahi sign in the back.
Yeah. Okay.
and I feel like it maybe should be in the shot a little bit.
you want to just move it over?
the great thing about
is there is just no attention to detail that was...
there we go. Perfect.
my favorite detail about this watch...
Oh, my gosh! see? Now it blocks it.
okay. Hey, Brandy, can you move the sign to the other side?
there? We're heading into...
maybe a little bit more, do you think? A little bit more?
beautiful. Can you move it just a little bit more?
sorry.
Yeah.
I'm like, move the sign?
how many times do I have to move the sign?
I was thinking, okay.
I'll put it wherever you want me to put it,
but at the end of the day, the set's not gonna sell the watches.
Liza, one and a half minutes.
and we tell them? Yep, you tell them.
y'all have one and a half minutes before we go live.
how are you?
how are you? Good to see you.
great to see you.

you're so helpful. Thank you.
Oh, come on. It's easy. This is fun.
30 seconds. Stand by.
get them ready, get them quiet.
30 seconds stand by.

okay, y'all ready?
all right, we're up. Let's go.
you're up. Go.

I've brought along a friend to help me.

is statement jewelry.
and, you know, what a better statement to make
than putting on one of these beautiful watches.
hottest trends.
you know, croc is one of the hottest trends right now.
gorgeous couture.
gorgeous couture pieces.
sophisticated-- He...
I didn't feel that we had a definite sort of agenda
to talk about the watch.
look at this -- I'm looking at them side by side.
I don't know how I would choose.
and so we just completely ignored Liza.
you can update your wardrobe.
you can update any look in your wardrobe.
one and a half minutes to go.
can't go any longer than five minutes.
45 seconds.
this has to be over in five minutes.

thank you very much, ladies.
we're gonna jump right back into another great item,
by popular demand.
okay. We're clear.
okay.
that's it?
that's it.
Oh! are you kidding me?
I think it didn't go too good.
we ran out of time, and I'm very disappointed
very disappointed in the way I managed it.
very disappointed.
but it's over, it's done, and so now it's out of my hands,
and it's up to the shoppers, and I hope they're calling.
all right, let's do it. Take it from the top.
let's do it. Let's go through it.
three, two, one, go.
good afternoon, everyone. I'm Gabrielle Kerr.
joining us is Isaac Mizrahi's luxury-brand ambassador.
welcome, Steuart Thank you for having me.
it's great to be here.
okay, gorgeous bag. There's no question.
I mean, obviously, his goal here with the domed satchel
is to bring haute couture here and make it accessible.
as the rehearsal went on,
I started seeing that, shoot, steuart is in his element here.
from the double stitching, you have the double straps here.
what these allow you to do is,
you can change your look from morning till night.
because of our good negotiation,
the girls had the slot before us.
they didn't have any time to work out the kinks.
our presentation was done. It looked great.
there was not much tweaking needed,
but, you know, anything can happen on live television.
Hey, we're 20 seconds out, guys.
make sure all the straps look really nice there
because they look kind of sloppy.
okay, they look good? You're happy?
that's good, steuart.
okay.
perfect, buddy.
this is the real deal.
there's no more rehearsal. This is live.
good afternoon, everyone. I'm Gabrielle Kerr.
I'd love to introduce you to our guest this evening.
isaac Mizrahi's luxury-brand ambassador, Steuart, joins me.
so, welcome, Steuart.
thank you so much for having me.
it's great to be here.
endless luxury...
haute couture, accessible.
...Here at QVC.
no question.
what Isaac Mizrahi brings here is endless luxury.
we really tried to bring something special to the QVC customer that's not...
good, right?
Yeah. Really good.
four minutes.
this is genuine leather, very
timeless classic.
it's a timeless classic.
QVC price at 194. 97 dollars So, talk to me about the design of this bag. Sure. No question.
soft. Snuggly.
Cavern-- or soft and snuggly.
...that great quality.
bag jewelry.
the bag jewelry here is great.
you have great hardware here.
cavernous bag.
so no longer are things gonna get lost,
and the organization of the pockets
really make it easy to find things throughout the bag.
soft. Comfortable.
Yeah, it's very soft, very comfortable. Snuggly.
I have this voice of Clint
cavernous and supple and cozy
and snuggly and -- and warm and tight.
I mean, he might as well have just said "moist."
luxurious and functional.
it's luxurious, and not only that,
beyond the luxury, it's really functional.
talk about Mizrahi.
it's tough to find a Mizrahi bag
at this great of quality at this price.
turn toward the camera.
with this price tonight, you're getting such a great value.
sassy satchel. Woman on the go.
it's a great sassy satchel for a woman on the go.
well, you know what?
this, brand-new today, our Isaac Mizrahi live!
Pebble-leather, double-strap domed satchel.
such a value.
it's a great value, a leather designer bag 20 seconds.
and look at that. There's that interior.
so easy to exactly find what you are looking for And not only that, I mean, there's still plenty of space.
...5, 4, 3... stop talking, steuart.
Steuart, thank you so much for bringing this to us. Thank you.
Vanessa, you look gorgeous as always.
and, guys, back to you.
good. Yes!
good. Yes!
very good.
I loved it, man. Good job.
thank y'all so much.
I think we did everything we could do
to get the most volume coming in.
if for some reason
the girls end up making more profit than we did,
then I've got to fight, and I will do whatever it takes
to become Mr. Trump's apprentice.
awesome man How was it?
I think it was good. You think? Or was it great?
man, I think -- I can't see how we could have improved on it.
I think it was wonderful. You know, I think we did great.
so, Isaac, what did you think of the two presentations?
right off the top of my head,
brandy seems to be very natural.
and, yet, he was very smooth also, wasn't he? He was smooth,
but I was a little concerned about the price
at which they put the bag.
how did you view the pricing of the bag versus the watch?
I thought the bag was a little high.
that's what I thought.
but I wonder if maybe brandy
didn't undervalue the watch just a little bit...
because, you know, there is a sweet spot for something,
and there's a way to make money.
there is a way to mark it up
and get exactly the right amount of money.
I don't know. Of course, the sales will tell.
it's all about the the sales. It is.
coming up...
brandy, why were you the co-host?
85% of their shoppers are caucasian.
somebody...
do you think a black person
would not do as well as a white person?
that's what I saw in the research.
that's a pretty big statement, isn't it?
I'm just being honest.
Yes, Mr. Trump.
how did you do as project manager?
I think I did a brilliant job as project manager.
brandy, how was she? I think she did a good job, sir.
why were you the co-host?
that was Liza's decision, sir.
Liza, why did you make that decision?
I made that decision based on the research
that I had found online while researching about QVC's viewers.
and 85% of their shoppers are Caucasian.
and so I kind of saw that as a positive to have Brandy
because she would be, like, a face
that would be, like, friends with most of the consumers.
so you think, obviously, in this world,
there's still discrimination?
not necessarily. I just think that
so what does it matter if she's Caucasian?
it just means that there would be more
of, like, a friendly face
and somebody that's more personable.
do you think a black person would not do as well as a white person?
no.
in fact, I thought I would do a brilliant job.
so why did you bring up Caucasian?
because that's what I saw in the research.
so, then, obviously, you think a white person
would do better in this case.
um, because I saw that as the demographic
okay, so, then you should say it.
I mean, there's nothing wrong with saying it.
and it's true. I thought it was an informed decision.
I really thought about it for a long time, and Brandy can attest to that.
I was actually going back and forth.
brandy, do you think she's right or wrong?
um, I don't think that it would have mattered
had there been a Caucasian versus an African-American woman.
do you think Lisa would have done just as well as you?
I think either of us would have done a good job, yes, sir.
but how do you feel about that? That's pretty a big statement, doesn't it?
not really.
it's a little bit of a sad statement, I think.
no. I'm just being honest.
and that's exactly how I view... I appreciate your hon
marketing and media and campaigns. I respect your honesty.
can I tell you? I respect your honesty.
thank you. Because whether you like it or not,
race probably is an issue,
and that's a pretty sad commentary.
Steuart, are you surprised to hear her say
that she picked brandy because she's white?
uh, you know, yeah. I would imagine so.
I wouldn't think race was a key factor here,
especially on our side of things
because we had an African-American host and me, so...
you think you won?
I do think we won.
what do you think,Clint?
I think we won, Mr. Trump.
I've gone back over carefully in my mind
every single step we took yesterday.
and I can't find a mistake we made.
do you think you priced too high or too low?
no, sir. I think we hit the sweet spot.
but, again, that's the point I'm getting at.
I don't know right now that if I had the task to do all over again,
even with more time to think about it,
that I would change anything at this point
without knowing the results.
gentlemen, what was your strategy
going into the negotiation table?
can I take this one? You bet.
so, our entire strategy was to dupe the girls
into thinking we wanted something we didn't
and ultimately get our number-one product.
which was? The purse -- we always wanted the purse,
but we made it seem like we wanted the watch.
so you could have had the watch maybe,
but you liked the purse better.
Why?
I told Steuart -- well, 'cause we wanted the time slot.
well, yeah, my wife...
has probably more than 20 purses,
and even more pairs of shoes.
but she only has 1 or 2 watches.
and so when we saw the purse
I thought you were doing poorly.
these are from the past, sir.
these are from back when I did well.
when we moved from Texas, our trailer was full of mainly shoes and purses.
is she selling purses slowly?
Yes, sir, she is, on ebay. She is. We need the money.
all right. Good.
you won't need it long. Go ahead.
well, my wife impulse-buys purses,
and she, when we were making money,
would buy a $600, $700, $800 purse,
and the markup usually is about 100%.
and we wanted that second time slot
as much or more as we wanted the purse.
so, Steuart, I actually think you did a good job.
but you were a little bit nervous.
you know, a little nervous.
it's a different type of speaking and communicating.
you know, you have an earpiece in your ear,
and you're hearing a lot. You're also expecting
people are screaming at you.
I'm feeding him key words and the host as well.
what were the key words you were feeding Steuart? I was feeding
I don't think he needs your key words.
well, actually, we worked it that way
because -- "supple," "cavernous..."
cavernous?
those are two words -- ..."organizing."
supple" and -- I like those two words.
this is why I almost had a hard time not laughing during this.
but I was also feeding the host words, as well,
like "snuggle
you know, words that mean something to women.
So,Liza, you think you won?
Yes. I actually think we won.
I looked at their price,
and I really feel like that's not an impulse buy for me.
okay.
brandy, were you happy with the job you did?
I'm proud of what I did. Okay.
I thought Brandy was really good. Yeah.
and I thought steuart was really good. Yes.
but in this case, it's all about the money.
so let's find out who won, all right?
Juan, tell me. How did the women's team do?
the women did well.
they did sell 77 watches and made $2, 998. 38 of profit.
very good.
you feel good about that?
I feel good, but I'll feel better when I hear the men's.
all right.
Catherine, how'd the men do?
the men sold 25 handbags at $194. 97 each
for a net profit of $2, 174. 25.
in other words, you got your ass kicked.
Damn!
boom! sorry. Sorry.
don't be so happy
because tonight two people are gonna be fired.
okay.
and I'm going to make my decision
as to who will be the final two.
go wait in the lobby.
you're coming back later on.
we'll see. Okay?
Yes. Good.
good luck, guys.
Steuart, Clint, stay here.
one of you is about to be fired.
so, Clint, you were project manager.
you lost. Why shouldn't I fire you?
Mr. Trump, you shouldn't fire me
because you got two guys sitting in front of you right here,
and one of them is gonna be your next CEO Of something.
I'm a CEO Right out of the box,
and I'm a Renaissance man who can take over any business.
Steuart, why should I keep you instead of Clint?
certainly, sir.
as to Clint's point, I mean, I'm a tried-and-tested CEO
I've been running my own business for the past 3 and a half Years,
and I can get my hands into anything.
why should I fire Clint?
well, you know,
talking about Clint in the trump organization
the only thing I can see that Clint doesn't bring
is that metropolitan savviness.
which is okay. No.
and it's not -- it's not something that's disrespectful to clint. clint is who he is.
I know a lot of guys like Clint,
and they're really successful guys.
truly. Truly.
just might not do that well in New York.
you know my attitude?
if you've got "it"
you know, the "it" factor... you can do it anywhere.
...you can do things quite nicely.
and I think Clint's a great guy.
but on this task, Clint was the project manager.
the primary decisions were made under Clint's watch,
and I certainly provided input.
who was the one that came up with the price point?
because the price point was really too high.
who came up with it?
I came up with the actual lower price point than
you know, we discussed everything from $149. 99.
and Steuart had even suggested maybe even up to $250.
I didn't want to break the $200 price point in this economy.
gentlemen, if I was to tell you
to sell me a 6-pack of beer for $40, what would you think?
and that's essentially what you were doing with this product.
the truth of the matter is,
this product for this venue simply was priced too high.
sort of both guilty for that, aren't you?
we were both confident that that price would work
because it was under $200,
and I know, based on seeing my wife's purses, that
you know, the sad thing is, if you'd sold 10 more purses
just 10 more -- you would have won.
and so,Steuart,
you can take a little blame because you were the pitchman.
I could.
I could. Sure.
definitely. Juan, how do you see it?
well, in our industry as headhunters,
we make a call often with two similar people,
similar skill sets.
but then there's corporate cultural fit.
and, in this case, knowing your organization,
I think Steuart would fit in better than Clint
from communication to playing the New York politics
of a big corporate organization.
these aren't similar people, sir.
and I want to disagree with you.
I have experiences, and I have things
that I bring to the table that steuart does not have yet.
not saying that he can't get there,
but Steuart is not the man I am as far my abilities.
how old are you,Clint?
I just turned 40.
how old are you, Steuart?
I'm 27 years old, sir.
and when you look
you look at my experience, "a," and you look at what
even in the tasks,Steuart has always turned to me.
in fact, yesterday on the helicopter,
he told me that I reminded him of his father.
I took that that as a backhanded compliment.
with the task, though.
I understand that, but what I'm telling you is -- that wasn't backhanded.
no, no, it wasn't backhanded.
I took that as a compliment.
but I also take that as,
I know that I'm more experienced than Steuart.
we're not talking about
in certain things, perhaps. We're talking about two separate people here.
Clint, I'm a huge believer in education.
Yes, sir.
what are your educational credentials?
Mr. Trump, I'm an attorney, Southern Methodist university.
I went to Texas Christian University,
undergraduate, Magna CUM Laude.
very good.
Steuart, do you think Clint is smarter than you?
you know, I think we have very different skill sets.
I'm really impressed.
his educational background is good.
no, he's got a great educational background.
well, I'm not done yet.
that's very impressive.
I'm very impressed.
I'm a real-estate broker and also a mediator.
and then you had some bad timing in real estate.
but everyone fell under.
Catherine, what's your opinion?
my opinion is a little different than my esteemed colleague Juan
because I think that clint has a bigger tool bag to work with.
I think that he has a greater breadth of experience.
I think that he can be used
in a number of different organizations,
perhaps not in New York city.
you have organizations that are not based here.
that's true. You know, I'm all over the place.
I'm all over the world.
so he may fit in much better than you in certain locations.
what's your educational background, Steuart?
I went to purdue university, at the business school there,
with a minor in finance and a minor in marketing.
and you graduated.
I graduated, and then I financed my own company,
which made over a million dollars
within the first year of operations.
at -- at -- I've had five companies
that have been million-dollar producers.
at 23 years old.
at -- at 23 years old myself,
as soon as I -- before I got out of law school.
Clint, you are very entrepreneurial.
I am, sir. I am the quintessential entrepreneur.
do you think more so than Steuart?
I-I love Steuart.
I would hire Steuart in a minute.
I think you do. I think you really have a good relationship.
I do. We definitely do.
and it's hard for me to sit here.
and I really think you're both outstanding
and you're both, in every way and in every category,
you're really tremendous people.
and there is no loser tonight.
there is no loser.
but, Steuart, you're fired.
thank you.
good luck.
see ya.
two good guys.
Yep.
very good guys. Tough decision.
Amanda, bring them in.
I'm gonna fire somebody right now.
it's never fun to lose,
but I defended myself the most I could in the boardroom
with keeping my integrity intact.
I don't think Mr. Trump made the right decision,
but it's ultimately his decision at the end of the day.
rockport presents next steps.
since leaving "the apprentice,"
I went right back to my business.
it gave me a lot of insights
of how I am as a leader, as a manager.
I just really have taken time to slow down every day,
stay a little bit more focused
versus running around all over the place
and thinking I'm getting a lot done.
and I think it's actually helped us a lot.
rockport -- put your best foot forward.
narrator: Ancient Rome.
from here, an empire sent out armies which mastered the known world.
this was the glorious civilisation that shaped our own.
for 500 years, Rome ruled supreme.
the Empire, they said, would last forever.
but then, it was all Just ripped apart.
this is the story of how Rome fell.
it's a tale of a weak emperor who tried to be strong.
barbarians are all beasts.
animals.
narrator: A tale of a barbarian king who wanted Justice.
the Emperor has betrayed us again.
this is the extraordinary story of how treachery and greed brought down the greatest city of the ancient world, and why it should never have happened at all.
we will win what was promised us. Either that, or Rome itself will fall!
narrator: At the start of the fifth century AD, Rome was under siege, threatened by a vast army of barbarian Goths.
40, 000 of them were poised at the city's gates.
the men are ready.
Rome is at your mercy.
narrator: Rome was defenceless.
even the remnants of its garrison abandoned their posts.
we stand our ground and fight to the last man.
Alaric, come on!
give the order!
there can be no turning back.
when we take Rome, it will not be a victory.
we will have failed our people.
I will have failed.
narrator: The events that brought Rome to the brink of disaster had their origins in an act of betrayal two years earlier.
at the beginning of the fifth century AD, the Roman Empire was under assault, its armies at breaking point.
it battled hordes of outsiders. Barbarians, as the Romans called them.
these tribes, with names like the Huns and the Vandals, had swept all before them.
even other barbarians.
one such smaller tribe, the Goths, had been forced from their lands near the Black Sea.
they had fled westward until they crossed into the Roman Empire.
the Goths now wandered the Empire, a refugee nation.
their leaders, Alaric and his brother-in-law, Athaulf,
man: # From the grass of the steppe, they have made a scourge # From the grass of the steppe... #
can you hear it?
what is it?
# Spirit of the wind, carry me # Spirit of the wind, carry me home #
come on.
man: # From the grass of the steppe they have made a scourge # From the grass of the steppe they have made a scourge # Spirit of the wind, carry me home #
how long do we have to live like this?
I swear to you, this will soon be over.
I have the word of the Emperor Honorius. He will grant us land.
good land. To settle in.
be patient.
ATHAULF: You're promising them too much.
alaric: I'm promising what I can deliver.
and you really trust the Emperor? - I trust Stilicho, and he holds the real power.
narrator: The man in whom Alaric had put his faith was Flavius Stilicho, the Emperor's chief advisor.
they had made a deal.
goth military muscle would serve the Empire in return for land.
but Stilicho had fallen out with his Emperor, and taken refuge in a church.
man: Flavius Stilicho.
if you continue to remain within the sanctuary of this church, the Emperor will take it as an admission of your guilt.
that you will fully conspired with the barbarian enemies of...
I have not conspired.
I've negotiated, for the sake of the Empire's security.
then make your case to the Emperor himself.
this letter guarantees your safety.
I understand.
Flavius Stilicho, I have another letter.
a later command from the Emperor. It orders your immediate execution.
narrator: The order for Stilicho's murder had come not from Rome, but from the Emperor's new headquarters in Ravenna, Northern Italy.
the Emperor Honorius had been on the throne since childhood.
his character would prove critical in Rome's eventual fate.
close the doors.
what are the people saying about me, Olympius? - That you did the right thing, my Lord.
the right thing?
Stilicho was like a father to me.
he taught me. - He deceived you, my Lord.
his policy of appeasing the barbarians would have dismantled your empire, piece by piece.
I feel...
horrible.
you may feel pain. But you should also be proud.
you put loyalty to the Empire over your own personal feelings.
what you did was strong and decisive.
Yes.
Yes, it was strong. And I will protect the Empire.
with your help, Olympius. - Of course, my Lord.
but your work is not finished.
Stilicho had many barbarian supporters within the Empire.
now they could organise against us.
we need to find a solution to this problem.
brother!
Stilicho's been killed. Executed by the Emperor.
and our deal's dead with him.
thank you. We'll train again tomorrow.
our deal is with the Emperor, not with Stilicho.
the Romans must still honour it. - They won't.
we'll never get our land, Alaric.
what will you tell the people?
I don't know.
I don't know.
narrator: A few days after Stilicho's death,
Olympius' solution to the barbarian problem was revealed.
every barbarian is a potential threat.
the Empire has been tainted ever since they crossed our borders.
OLYMPIUS: And now they live among us, in our homes.
please.
OLYMPIUS: You know the teachings.
we have reason. They are irrational.
we are controlled by intellect.
they are ruled by base instinct.
woman: Please, not my son, please!
OLYMPIUS: Throughout our history, whenever Rome has stood up to the barbarian, we have flourished.
man: Death to all barbarians!
narrator: The massacre of barbarian families was brutal even by Roman standards.
the survivors fled.
among them, thousands of barbarian soldiers who had deserted the Roman Army.
they all sought the same sanctuary.
you're safe now.
he was just a boy.
my boy.
what can I do?
make Rome suffer as I have suffered.
this cannot be about simple vengeance. - We've 30, 000 men now.
let's march on Ravenna, capture the Emperor and force him to honour the deal he made with us.
we'll never trap him in Ravenna.
there's water on three sides, marsh on the other.
that's why he squats there. He'll see us coming and be long gone.
we need a target that can't escape us.
something that Honorius really values.
we'll march on Rome.
you want to take Rome? - No, Berig.
I want to hold Rome hostage.
we threaten to take it.
the city's the heart of their Empire.
no emperor could survive the shame of losing it. He'll honour his promise first.
they'll fight hard to defend it.
they can't.
that's the beauty of it. Their armies are scattered across the Empire.
Rome's more vulnerable now than it's ever been.
let's see if Honorius wants to be the first Emperor to preside over the city's fall.
we were promised a new homeland.
the Emperor has broken that promise.
so today we march against him. Today we march against Rome.
the way is open to us, but it will not be easy.
I swear to you I will lead us to victory.
we will win what was promised us. Either that, or Rome itself will fall!
narrator: The Goth war machine swept through Italy.
it met with little opposition.
Honorius's armies were already fully occupied, countering rebellion in Gaul and attacks from across the Rhine.
so, Just three months after leaving their camp in Noricum, the Goths arrived outside the walls of Rome.
block every route into the city.
nothing gets in. Nothing.
our people are hungry.
now the Romans will find out how it feels.
amongst those trapped in the city, the Emperor's younger sister, Galla Placidia.
Petronius, the truth.
how much food do we have left? - Enough for ten days. No more.
all the grain merchants are closed. There's nothing.
even for the Emperor's sister? - My lady, the city is starving.
people are dying. If your brother doesn't act...
it's not my brother who's besieging Rome.
this is absurd. - I'm sorry, my lady. We're doing our best.
I know you're trying.
from today, we're all on the same rations. Myself included.
do you understand?
my brother won't let Rome starve.
now Alaric's asking for four provinces. Noricum, Dalmatia and the two Venetias.
my Lord, he may as well demand your whole empire.
and what do you suggest we do, Olympius? Our troops are stretched as it is.
his Majesty is right. We do not have the forces to contend with Alaric.
so we negotiate with the barbarian? Is that what you're saying, Jovius?
we give in to his threats? - At least keep him talking.
that way, we lose everything.
perhaps if I give them land, they'll think me generous.
if only that were true, but, my Lord, you cannot afford it.
these provinces pay us a great deal in taxes. Give them away and they won't.
our financial situation is already critical.
nevertheless, your Majesty's instinct is right.
go on, Jovius, I'm listening.
by negotiating with Alaric, we are buying time. That is what we need.
so that when we have dealt with the rebellions elsewhere, our forces...
what forces? If you give Alaric what he wants, there won't be any forces.
no taxes, no army.
no army, no Empire. Simple logic, my Lord.
we will reject his demands.
dressers.
get the boot.
ATHAULF: Their garrison is pathetic. A handful, at best.
we could sack this city any time we like. - And what then?
if we sack Rome, we'll have nothing to bargain with.
the Emperor must believe our threat.
but if I ever lead our men through those gates, we've lost.
it's not as complicated as that for the men. Or for me.
the Empire is too strong.
in the end, they'll come after us.
we'll be hunted and homeless forever. - Our men need paying.
they see a city full of gold and treasures and they can't understand - why you don't just take it. - No. We continue the siege.
if my plan works we'll get the gold, and our promised land.
narrator: As the siege wore on,
Rome's desperate citizens turned to the Senate for leadership.
it was the nearest thing they had to a parliament, but no longer the force it once was.
our great city. A million hungry people and the Emperor does nothing.
he's safe in Ravenna.
Rome means nothing to him. - His sister lives here.
how many times has he visited our city, Festus?
three. And one of those as a baby.
no, we the Senate must take control of the situation.
we can't make a move without the Emperor's... - Forget the Emperor.
we must negotiate with Alaric ourselves directly.
negotiate with him?
I, for one, am not about to meekly present my arse to that barbarian.
I said I'd win us gold and land. Today, the gold.
and you are?
we represent the great Senate of Rome.
we speak for the people and the glorious city itself.
well, a simple name would have done.
tell me, great Senate. Is your Emperor going to help you?
our Emperor knows we can defend ourselves.
and he won't negotiate with a savage.
but you will.
I'm not here to negotiate with you.
I'm here to tell you that we have 100, 000 armed citizens ready to defend Rome, ready to attack your camp if you don't withdraw immediately.
then come out and fight.
the thicker the hay, the easier it's cut.
just how much of a stupid savage do you think I am?
I know how many soldiers you have in your city.
I know how many soldiers you have on every single gate.
now, shall we start this again?
ATTALUS: What do you want?
what will it take for you to lift this siege?
I want your gold. Your silver.
every treasure. All of it.
you would leave us with nothing?
no. I'll leave you your souls.
narrator: The Senate did what Alaric wanted.
to its citizens' dismay, Rome's public and state buildings were stripped of much of their wealth.
all Rome's riches without spilling a single drop of blood.
you were always the clever one.
and now for the land.
and you're telling me this is all Rome's treasure?
all the riches of the glorious city itself? - Yes.
5, 000 pounds of gold. 30, 000 pounds of silver.
the finest silks and spices.
not such a great city, after all.
we've stripped every house and public building.
Ah.
and what about your own personal hoards? Cleaned them out too?
I don't think so. And I'm disappointed.
I think we'd better come and have a look for ourselves.
see what our swords turn up, hidden in little nooks and crannies.
yes?
this is all we have.
Really?
this gold. Not enough.
not nearly enough.
it doesn't buy you your freedom.
it buys you... three days.
I'll let food in for three days.
and I suggest you use the time wisely.
I suggest you go to your Emperor and tell him that if he gives me what he once promised, I'll leave Rome.
if you can persuade him to do that, you, Senator Attalus, will have saved your city.
narrator: Alaric was true to his word.
within a few days, food was allowed back into Rome.
Attalus took with him a new proposal from Alaric.
do you know how I got here? Escorted by barbarians through my own country.
we're all delighted to see you alive, Attalus.
please, won't you eat something first?
you must be starving after your journey.
he's only asking for one province now. Just Noricum.
that's not the actions of a looting thug. He wants a settlement.
he won't keep his side of any bargain, we can be sure of that.
general Sarus, you were born a Goth. What's your opinion?
can we trust Alaric?
he has no honour. He's a killer.
greedy for anything he can get his hands on. - Precisely.
he will destroy Rome if you don't give him what he wants.
general Sarus, tell me, before you joined the Roman Army, weren't you and Alaric rivals for the leadership of the Goths?
he tricked me out of it. That's his nature.
why he can't be trusted. - I see.
a barbarian blood feud.
my Lord, we can't be influenced like this, by personal grievances.
Rome's survival is at stake.
your sister is there. If that matters to you, my Lord.
I haven't forgotten.
and you're wrong to think I don't care about Rome.
tell Alaric... - My Lord...
no more, Olympius.
he can have what he wants. I don't want any more Romans to die.
for the moment, our treasury will just have to do without Noricum.
it's mostly mountains, anyway.
narrator: Senator Attalus returned to Rome a hero.
everyone believed that there would soon be a peace treaty.
even the Goths.
you will tell the Emperor we accept his terms.
we'll withdraw to Tuscia. Give the order to strike camp.
narrator: As a sign of goodwill before final negotiations,
Alaric agreed to pull back from Rome.
I can see what you're doing, my Lord. And it's brilliant.
is it?
what am I doing, Olympius?
well, now Alaric thinks he's won, now he's withdrawn from Rome, we can get more troops into the city to defend it properly.
but is that a good idea, Olympius?
breaking the agreement? - It's an idea of genius, my Lord.
it will give us the upper hand. That's what you intended, isn't it?
Yes. Yes, it was.
but will it work? - Of course, my Lord, I assure you.
everyone will see it as your masterstroke.
so, how many troops can we send?
narrator: 6, 000 soldiers were gathered to reinforce Rome's garrison in secret.
but their commander made the mistake of taking his troops by open road.
silence. I said, shut up!
the Emperor's sending troops to Rome.
trying to sneak them in.
he's double-crossed us.
we'll head them off.
I'll kill every one of them.
narrator: Honorius's relief force never reached Rome.
Athaulf intercepted them with the full might of the Goth army.
only 100 Roman soldiers survived.
I asked you again and again, "Are 6, 000 troops enough?
and you said, "Yes.
I thought it would be sufficient.
I never thought Alaric would discover... - You were wrong!
say you were wrong.
please, my Lord... - Say it. Say it!
I was wrong.
so, my brilliant...
my stroke of genius didn't work.
and it's all your fault.
I should never have listened to you!
everything that you have suggested has been a disaster.
look at what has happened. Get out of my sight.
get out of my city. Now!
please, my Lord. Please, I've always tried to help.
what do I do now?
Athaulf.
I was told you were wounded.
this is not my blood.
this is the blood of our soldiers.
the Emperor's word means nothing.
I say we go back to Rome and we destroy it.
no. We already have their gold.
Alaric. They have more gold back there, much more, and the men want revenge.
you know this is about land. Not vengeance.
without Roman recognition, we will never be secure.
it's too late for that.
these are Romans, Alaric. We are dirt under their feet.
they will never treat us as equals. Why can't you see it?
the Emperor has betrayed us twice. He cannot be allowed to get away with it.
you cannot allow it.
otherwise our people will suspect you're weak.
that it's time for a new leader.
I'm their leader, Berig.
then lead us.
there's another way to do this.
we will go back to Rome, but not to sack it.
we have to be clever, especially now.
if the Emperor doesn't value Rome, let's see if Rome values its Emperor.
why the truce?
what's he doing? Why doesn't he just take what he wants and get it over with?
he's come to gloat. Size us up, like cuts of meat.
I want to talk to all of you inside now.
your Emperor broke his word!
tell me why I shouldn't burn this city and kill every single person in it!
my men are begging for your blood!
but...
unlike your Emperor, I'm an honourable man.
how have you become so weak?
it's time to show this Emperor what you think of him.
it's time for Rome to take control of its own destiny again.
choose from amongst yourselves a new leader.
a new emperor I can negotiate with.
an emperor who will enforce the promise that was made to my people.
this is the man I suggest you choose.
narrator: In the winter of 409 AD, one of the most bizarre events in Rome's history occurred.
the Senate turned against their own Emperor and chose Attalus in his place.
all at the behest of a barbarian.
purple suits him, don't you think?
he's a fool.
he'll never have the authority to give us our land.
Attalus will deliver it without even trying.
all Honorius cares about is his own authority.
and a rival emperor? It weakens him.
Honorius will give us anything we ask for to be rid of our new friend.
it's men like him who stood by and watched while our people were murdered.
killed on these streets. - I know.
but this is how we get what we want, Athaulf. Trust me.
is this what you always wanted? To replace my brother?
I had no idea you were so happy with your brother's policies.
you enjoy watching people starve? - You don't see it, do you?
he's using you against my brother. - No. You don't see it.
Alaric has agreed to remain outside the city and his army's at my service.
unlike your hopeless brother, I will restore greatness to Rome.
I cannot have you undermining me. - What are you saying?
I shall issue my first Imperial command.
you are to be confined under guard to your villa.
JOVIUS: I know it looks bleak, my Lord, but this could be Alaric's first mistake.
how can it be a mistake? Attalus and Rome have allied with the Goths.
exactly. And as soon as the people see Attalus for what he is, they'll turn against him.
I suggest we use Alaric's own tactic against them.
what do you mean? - I mean, my Lord, that we may have to think the unthinkable.
starve Rome.
I've just tried to save them from starvation. - I know that, my Lord, I know that.
we all have family there. But this is a test of wills, my Lord.
think. Who will follow Attalus if he can't even feed his own people?
narrator: Jovius' strategy was simple. By the fifth century AD,
Rome had become almost entirely dependant on grain shipped from North Africa.
so Honorius ordered those supplies to be cut at source.
within weeks, Romans once again began to starve.
Attalus'popularity collapsed.
in Rome's streets, the rule of law started to crumble.
Honorius is better advised than I expected.
your plan's not working.
we're worse off than we were before.
Honorius will never recognise our claims now.
it's time to take this city.
we should have done it months ago when we first saw it.
no one believes in your tactics anymore.
the voices against you are becoming deafening.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life fighting and running.
fighting and moving, always looking over my shoulder. Do you?
what else can we do?
our people want an end to this, one way or another!
let's take what we can from Rome.
carve out a new homeland for ourselves with our swords and their gold.
Alaric, the people chose you for your strength.
they're talking about Berig... as a leader.
deal with it.
now.
I've done nothing. Alaric is not fit to lead us!
you know that!
you know that.
if you give me 20, 000 of your men, under Roman command,
I can put together a fleet, sail to Africa - and force the governor to reopen the trade... - Shut up!
stop trying to be clever.
I assure you, General, I am trying to resolve this situation.
you! You're the most pathetic worm I've ever encountered!
just be quiet. You're no use!
I am the Emperor.
get him out of here before I kick him to death!
get off me!
you.
take this to Honorius.
tell him I grew tired of Attalus.
tell him...
I will meet with him to discuss a fair settlement.
he can propose the terms.
but remind him...
my army remains at the gates of Rome.
if we don't come to an arrangement, I'll sack the city.
I swear it.
now go.
so Alaric has had enough. - Congratulations, my Lord.
tell him I'll meet him. He can come to us in Ravenna.
you cannot do that, my Lord.
Oh, really, Sarus? And what gives you the right?
I'm sorry, but I strongly advise against this. Alaric is not to be trusted.
and why are you so certain of that?
he killed my family. Before.
well, I'm afraid your past rivalries are nothing to do with us, General.
and you serve the Emperor now.
my Lord, Alaric's Goths are still outside Rome.
we must give them some land, but the least they'll accept. Not an inch more.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
thank you.
narrator: In the summer of 410 AD,
Alaric and a small bodyguard set off to sign a final treaty.
Sarus.
that bastard, Sarus.
the Emperor has betrayed us again.
narrator: And so it was, nearly two years after their arrival at the gates of Rome,
Alaric's barbarian army finally fell upon the city.
God have mercy on our souls.
narrator: What we know from sources suggest that the gates were opened to the Goths by some of Rome's own citizens.
they wished to be spared further agony.
it was a forlorn hope.
don't burn the churches! Leave the churches!
leave her.
I said, leave her!
she's a valuable hostage.
my apologies.
you'll be treated with respect, I give you my word.
it's over, Alaric. You've won.
is this what we set out for?
no. But this is better than nothing.
we'll get our land.
and we still have something to bargain with.
let's get going. Tell the men we head south.
what have I done?
you've done nothing, my Lord. It wasn't your fault.
done nothing.
that's right, isn't it?
nothing.
we were betrayed. Sarus sent his troops. They ambushed Alaric.
Sarus couldn't stand us negotiating with him.
Olympius was right.
barbarians are all beasts.
animals.
find Sarus. I want Sarus!
he's disappeared, my Lord. I'm sorry.
I wanted peace.
I was ready for peace.
how will I be remembered now?
narrator: Honorius remained Emperor for a further 13 years.
he died childless and vilified for his role in Rome's decline.
Alaric died Just four months after the sack of Rome.
he went to his death tormented by his failure to find a safe haven for his people.
Athaulf succeeded Alaric and four years later, he married Galla Placidia.
it was an astonishing alliance, but there is no evidence that it wasn't for love.
after eight further years of wandering,
Alaric's successors finally achieved his dream.
a secure new homeland in what is now western France.
the kingdom of the Visigoths.
Alaric's sack of Rome was not the end of the Roman Empire, but it was the beginning of the end.
the same factors that weakened Honorius, poor leadership, the loss of territory and revenue, finally overwhelmed it.
in 476 A D, the last Roman emperor in the west was deposed.
in the east, the Empire continued in a different form.
its capital, Constantinople.
but the glory that was ancient Rome, a superpower legendary for its brilliance, and its brutality, for its madness, and for its beliefs, that was finished.
its familiar sights and scenes
are spread across four theme parks,
two water parks,
you may think you know all about this Florida retreat...
but you don't.
there's a side to the resort
that most visitors don't know about.
in the next hour,
we'll show you Walt Disney World like you've never seen it,
including some things that may surprise you,
like what goes on before the park doors open?
how do you drive a real racecar?
or swim in the world's largest aquarium?
what happens after dark, and what happens after that?
and what really lurks behind these doors?
it's more than just theme parks.
it's a world of secrets and surprises,
the undiscovered Walt Disney World.
when the Magic Kingdom park opened,
visitors were thrilled by this atlantic coast version of Disneyland.
Walt Disney chose these 47 square miles of central Florida
to give him plenty of room to expand.
based on California's own Magic Kingdom,
the Florida version was the first park to grace Disney's new home.
next to open was epcot,
giving visitors a taste of the far reaches of the globe,
as well as a look into the future.
the Disney-mgm studios brought the magic of hollywood
and some of Disney's most thrilling attractions.
and finally, Disney's animal kingdom
appeared to be a new species of theme park,
with its blend of animal adventures
and theme park thrills.
but parks and resorts
are just a small part of the Walt Disney World experience.
there's a lot more that has gone undiscovered until now.
sunrise at the animal kingdom - rise and shine.
just you, your coffee,
and that giraffe outside your balcony
at Disney's animal kingdom lodge.
the creatures grazing in the savannah around the lodge
are completely separate from those at the animal kingdom theme park,
making this your own private reserve.
nearby, at Disney's animal kingdom,
you'll find river rafts...
dinosaur thrills...
disney characters...
and the park's signature attraction,
the kilimanjaro safari,
where an open-sided safari vehicle
takes you on an expedition through acres of hills and rivers
teeming with wild animals.
but for a special safari experience
just for concierge guests at Disney's animal kingdom lodge,
there's something most visitors don't know about the sunrise safari,
a trip around the reserve...
...before the park opens.
it was our attempt to re-create a true african game drive.
now if you go to africa and stay at a lodge similar to ours,
your trip really revolves around looking for animals.
you get up at the crack of dawn, grab a cup of coffee,
a cup of tea and a quick scone, and you head out into the bush.
narrator: and the safari vehicle is all yours.
it makes stops along the way,
so you can take all the pictures
and ask all the questions you want.
and you'll see a lot more action, since this is when the animals start their day.
BRANDON: the sunrise safari at Disney's animal kingdom is the best time of day to take that trip.
you head to the park just as the sun's coming up.
the air's cool, the animals are just coming out for the morning,
eating, grazing, getting very close to the vehicles.
okay folks, we have a bongo real close to us here.
everybody quiet.
look off to the left-hand side of the vehicle.
one of our first antelope species of the morning.
okay, we'll go ahead and stop right here.
what makes the sunrise safari very unique is the intimate dialogue and relationship that you have with your guide.
you get a chance to learn about some of those things that we do with our animals here
that you wouldn't normally learn about on our normal safari.
okay, look at this.
we got a beautiful look at some giraffes.
O'brien: the sunrise safari is cool
because you're out there
and you know it's not an opportunity that everybody that walks through the front gate is going to be able to experience.
it's actually on a real safari.
you're driving along, and as you see an animal,
the guide will drive you over towards the animal
and will actually stop and let you look,
and that's something that you can't do when the front gates are really open.
that was awesome.
we saw so many animals, and our tour guide, Joe,
he answered every question we had.
narrator: when the safari is over, the hungry group heads to tuskers,
in the animal kingdom's harambe village,
for a traditional post-safari feast.
Kalla: as in africa, following your safari,
you typically come back to a giant, beautiful, buffet breakfast if it's a sunrise experience,
and, as in africa,
you come back and sit at the table with your guide
and share your experiences of the day.
narrator: most people don't realize that Walt Disney World is home to two of the world's best water parks
with relaxing rivers...
sunny beaches, shark reefs...
and the wildest water slides around.
some of the best secrets are at typhoon lagoon,
a park elaborately themed
to look like an island that's been devastated by a typhoon.
brennan: the back-story for typhoon lagoon
really is this mysterious geothermal activity that happened.
at the same time, there was this enormous typhoon and storm surge
that picked up all these boats and aquatic life
and shoved it up into the middle of central Florida.
narrator: that's not all you'll find here.
typhoon lagoon boasts one of the biggest wave pools anywhere.
the waves here are famous, but where do they come from?
to get a sense of what a real wave feels like,
the wave pool's technology lets them create very realistic waves
with distinct shape and speed.
this huge wall behind me has 12 chambers in it
that hold about 6, 000 to 7, 000 gallons each.
the hydraulics open the doors faster than gravity,
actually forcing it down,
letting the water come out unrestricted
so it hits the bottom here and goes forward
and creates that great big wave you see.
narrator: that's not all you can do with those big, perfect waves.
did you know that before the park opens
you can actually surf?
that's right -- you and 25 of your closest friends
can book the lagoon just for yourselves in the morning,
or for the entire night,
and go for it on your surfboards.
they call it a private surf party.
in three hours, they send out 100 waves,
one every 90 seconds.
and if you can't surf, don't worry 'cause you can learn.
Carroll: we have our surfing school here at typhoon lagoon.
it's a great place to teach people to surf
because we can control the entire environment
as to when the wave comes out, what size it is,
and all the sea creatures that don't exist over here,
that make it so much more easier for people
who want to just give it a shot,
to give it a try in relative safety,
to find out if it's what they want to really do.
narrator: Craig teaches people to surf right here at the lagoon.
welcome to typhoon lagoon.
y'all ready to surf?
narrator: classes are held twice a week
and last 2 1/2 hours with just 12 students per class.
what we do is we teach the basics of surfing.
we're just trying to get you to be able to stand up on your feet on a surfboard to say, "I did it."
grab the board, do a push up, throw your feet up under you.
now notice her front foot hit right about where her hand is.
having a surf school at that typhoon lagoon
at Walt Disney World is really pretty smart
when you think about it
because there are so many would-be surfers out there
and we don't have an opportunity to go out to the ocean
and find the big waves to learn.
now what we're gonna do is everybody here
is gonna do this two by two.
you're gonna come over and get on the surfboards
with our instructors and do a couple of pop ups
so we make sure that you have it down properly.
narrator: they make things as easy for the student as possible,
right down to the special 7- to 10-foot soft boards,
which are much easier to ride.
Carroll: the popping up on the surfboard
is probably the most important thing that we teach on dry land.
after that you get into the water, try to stand up,
if you make a few mistakes we'll actually work with you on that,
and pretty soon,
we'll have you up and riding waves at typhoon lagoon.
young man: the water was warm.
you didn't freeze your butt off when you were out there.
it was probably the best experience I've ever had.
here you go. Paddle hard.
young woman: I was really nervous at first.
once I got in the water, the instructors
they gave me lots of pointers, really made me feel comfortable,
and I caught my first wave the first time out.
O'brien: a cool thing about the surf school
is the fact that you get the same perfect wave every time,
and, you know, you might float around out in the ocean for two hours waiting for that one perfect wave.
narrator: there's so much to see at Walt Disney World,
but there are some things they won't allow you to see.
have you ever wanted to go behind the scenes?
believe it or not,
there are ways to get into the backstage areas of Walt Disney World.
one of the most popular ways
is the keys to the kingdom program at the Magic Kingdom.
this half-day experience
takes visitors into restricted areas all over the park.
here we are at the haunted mansion.
this attraction, as you take a look at it,
looks like it's probably the least taken care of attraction.
Shoemaker: Disney's keys to the kingdom tour
is an experience that we offer in the Magic Kingdom every day.
the tour guide is able to share hidden treasures about the park.
you might learn something about an attraction
that you may have never seen before
or have never known to even look for.
we also take them right up close into the attraction
so they can find out some of the secrets behind what we do.
narrator: the guides, in their smartly pressed blue plaid costumes,
are obviously well-informed on all sorts of subjects
related to the Magic Kingdom, from general points of fact
to some things a little more hidden.
do you know there are hidden mickeys on the inside
as well as on the outside?
hidden what?
one of Walt Disney World's biggest and most debated secrets
is the hidden mickey.
what is a hidden mickey?
a hidden mickey is subtle tribute to mickey mouse
hidden in any of the Disney parks, or now hotels or shops.
typically, it consists of three circles,
the large head and the two small ears.
hidden mickeys are actually hidden images left in our parks,
most of the time by imagineers,
the people that create our parks,
as ways to represent their own work.
narrator: the imagineers have cleverly concealed these mickey mouse symbols all over Walt Disney World,
inside and outside attractions, facades,
even bathrooms, but no official record of them exists.
how many can you find?
every year, millions of people
navigate their way through Walt Disney World,
armed with their maps and their plans for the day,
but did you know there's another way to do it?
disney offers special v. I.P. Tours,
but the privilege is not limited to the privileged.
you can get your own v. I.P. Experience
on your very next visit.
woman #1: when you come to Disney and you have a tour guide,
you don't have to face the challenge
of figuring out the entire park,
what happens when, who is where,
and everything else that goes on.
as, as a parent, you get to enjoy the experience
and get to see everything you want to see
and not miss anything
because you're not trying to figure out somebody else's game.
with v. I.P. Treatment, you'll not only save time,
but you can leave the planning to the experts.
that doesn't mean skipping lines,
but your v. I.P. Guide will give you a helping hand.
I'm going to help expedite their visit
by getting them fast passes throughout the day.
I'm going to arrange character meet-and-greets for them.
I'm gonna to make sure their vacation is taken care of,
like a personal concierge, while they're here visiting.
if you look up in the top window
you see seven summits expeditions?
the name of one of our former presidents,
narrator: the v. I.P. Tours have been around since almost the beginning.
Walt Disney himself used to give personal tours at Disneyland to all kinds of v. I.P. S as a special request.
Oh, we get all types of special requests
and it's good to say that almost 100% of the time
we can meet whatever request we have.
narrator: from time to time, you may spot a v. I.P. Tour guide
leading their charges through the crowds.
when I was a little girl and we came to Disney World,
we always had a v. I.P. Tour guide.
and I remembered that
when we planned our first trip here with our children,
and I thought, "well they must still do it,
and made a few phone calls and was really delighted
to find out that the v. I.P. Tour services still existed.
it has become a family tradition.
man #1: it is now.
Yeah, we won't come back without one.
we won't. They're terrific.
Walt Disney World
its four theme parks, more than 200 restaurants, 19 hotels,
and one in particular with a secret of its own.
on a deep blue lagoon, right next to the Magic Kingdom,
sits the 15-floor contemporary resort.
its unique a-frame design and indoor monorail station
makes it a modern masterpiece.
many of its 2, 000 rooms look out over a beach
that skirts a lagoon behind the resort.
from the dock here, you can rent watercraft
and do something that very few know about
you can actually go parasailing at Walt Disney World.
it's easy to do.
the trips launch from the docks just behind the contemporary resort.
just strap yourself in...
...and before you know it, you're airborne.
I didn't even know that you could parasail.
you kind of think of Disney
as just theme parks and roller coasters.
man #2: I really liked getting to see the grand floridian
and the wilderness lodge
and just the expanse of all the parks.
it was just an incredibly different perspective.
soaring 100 feet higher than the contemporary resort,
you're in the air for 10 minutes and can see for miles.
Oh, this is awesome.
it wasn't scary at all.
I thought it would be, but it wasn't.
I didn't have to work at all
and just got to float up there and enjoy the view.
perfect landing.
back on solid ground,
there are other ways to get around -- the automobile.
for decades, americans have been in love with their cars.
Walt Disney was no different,
and for decades,
disney parks have helped fuel that love affair,
and helped kids live out their car-driving dreams.
at the Magic Kingdom on opening day,
you could drive a two-seater at the grand prix raceway,
now called the indy speedway,
a long 2, 260 feet of track through a simulated race course,
including a race-results tower and squealing tires.
a thrill at seven miles an hour.
pretty fast without a license.
in March 1999,
epcot raised the speed limit and opened test track,
an automotive proving ground where guests buckle up
for the longest ride in the park's history,
and at 65 miles an hour, the fastest.
but where do you go
if you want to do some real high-speed driving on your own?
in a far corner of the Magic Kingdom parking lot,
there is a genuine speedway that hosts professional events,
but did you know that when the pros aren't on the track,
they'll let you get out there yourself
and drive a real racecar?
it's called the richard petty driving experience.
at 145 miles an hour,
it's the ultimate in high-speed driving fun.
O'brien: the whole idea of nascar and of sports-car driving
is really hot right now
and you can go down there and within a couple of hours,
you can just go high-speed riding
or you can take lessons and drive it yourself.
richard petty driving experience
is a place where your average race fan could come
and drive a racecar and that's pretty unique
because a lot of other sports, like baseball, or football,
or basketball, you can go in the backyard,
shoot some hoops, throw the ball around.
there's not many places you can go and drive a racecar
and these are authentic winston-cup style stock cars,
so it's the real deal.
narrator: the real deal from tires to rims
to the 110-octane racing fuel,
you drive a nascar racer at nascar speeds
around a banked, oval track.
there's a big difference between driving one of these
and driving a fast car on the street.
first of all, this is legal, so you can come out here
and stretch that right foot out a little bit,
but pretty much anybody can drive straight.
narrator: the hard part is turning,
but at the speedway,
professional drivers will give you some gear...
okay Eric, let's go ahead
and get you a driving suit.
...and the proper training
before they let you behind the wheel.
how are you guys doing this morning?
good.
y'all ready to drive some racecars? Oh, yeah.
most of the instruction is done in what we call
the in-car instruction, which is a van ride.
we put them in the van.
we take them for a few laps around the racetrack,
to show them the line, some of the flags, some hand signals.
then we have an in-car part of the instruction,
which is where we gather 'round one of the racecars.
we introduce them to the cars.
hook over the shoulder. Slide the wheel right up.
narrator: after the classroom and hands-on instruction,
they let you get behind the wheel to see what you've got.
the feeling of driving one of these racecars
there's no feeling like it.
it's unbelievable. You can't describe it.
it was incredible. It was absolutely incredible.
williams: you know, just about anywhere else you work,
you have customers who are unhappy.
they complain about different things,
but my customers are driving racecars
and we're basically making dreams come true.
narrator: want to leave the driving to someone else?
here's another option.
this one is fast, it's free, and is unique to Disney
the monorail system,
a classic Disney attraction and an all-time favorite since appearing at Disneyland back in 1959.
Walt came back from a trip in Europe
and handed me all these pictures of a monorail train
that he'd seen in germany, and said, "we are gonna build one for Disneyland.
I had never seen such a monorail,
so I immediately started designing something
somewhat different and we just started in designing monorails
without knowing anything about them.
narrator: the Walt Disney World monorail
is also the most traveled transportation system In the world,
carrying 50 million passengers every year
down almost 15 miles of guideway.
more than 200 feet long, with 52 doors and 124 tires,
each train carries up to 7, 000 riders per direction per hour,
accommodating as many passengers as a six-lane freeway.
O'brien: monorails are really synonymous with Disney.
people look at monorails
as not only a mode of transportation anymore,
but as a ride.
people just get on it and just ride
and come back to where they took off
just to experience a monorail ride.
narrator: how many monorails are there?
an even dozen in Walt Disney world, all identified by color.
it takes three weeks to paint an entire train,
which is done at the monorails' own custom paint shop.
Walt Disney World has one of the most unique paint booths In all the world.
not only are we able to paint our trains,
here at Walt Disney World,
we do so in one of the largest paint booths anywhere.
this paint booth is large enough
to drive a monorail right inside,
and not only is that unique,
the paint booth is 25 feet off the ground.
narrator: what does it take to keep these trains of the future running smoothly day after day, year after year?
it all takes place in the monorail maintenance bay
called the roundhouse.
any time we need to perform an inspection
on the underside of the monorail car,
we have a dropout beam that we can lower.
this allows us to look at the side shocks, sidearm bushings,
side wheels, or safety wheels on the bottom of the monorail.
you see we lower the beam, we push it out of our way,
and then we can actually get up underneath the monorail
and see the equipment that we're inspecting.
right now we're changing out one of our side shocks.
our side shocks are used for stabilizing the monorails.
the side wheels run alongside the monorail track,
keeping the monorail from swaying back and forth as it's moving down the track.
narrator: the track itself is interlaced
and manipulated with switching mechanisms,
just like traditional train tracks.
the switching, however,
is something guests never get to see.
have you ever seen something like this on a monorail beam?
it's called a monorail tractor,
a modern version of the handcarts
used with conventional trains.
technicians take the tractor out to examine the track
and to resurface and maintain the beamway.
recently, the monorail fleet
has undergone a series of computer upgrades.
the result -- the trains are easier than ever to operate.
we just recently upgraded this console.
some of the enhancements that we've made on this train
is the addition of a card reader.
the monorail pilot will come onboard the train,
they'll swipe their card.
it will actually log them in to the train.
there's several indications
that show up onboard the upper display,
that includes the pilot's speed as they're driving,
brake pressure,
their spacing from other trains, for the monorail pilot.
narrator: did you know there's a way to co-pilot a monorail yourself?
the secret is simple.
first, go to the transportation and ticket center's
monorail station.
find a station attendant
and let them know you want to ride up front.
they'll seat you on this special purple bench.
by sitting on that bench,
you send an unspoken signal to the monorail pilot
that you want to co-pilot the next train.
although the hands-on driving is still left to the pilot,
since a computer card is needed to activate the computer,
she'll be happy to show you around
and explain how things work.
bon voyage.
narrator: a well-entrenched and integral part of the Walt Disney World resort is a place called epcot.
originally conceived as a prototype community of the future,
epcot theme park is the choice for those wanting to explore and discover.
here you'll find the familiar sights of spaceship earth...
world showcase...
and it's newest attraction, mission space,
but did you know that epcot
is also home to the world's sixth largest ocean?
HOPKINS: the living seas is the largest aquarium in the world.
it's home to over 3, 000 fish, sharks, rays,
turtles, and dolphins
and it is the most visited aquarium in the country as well.
narrator: it's big all right.
it took 22 months to build,
and holds 5. 7 million gallons of water.
in fact, one inch of the main-tank depth
equals 17, 000 gallons.
spaceship earth, the big ball that is epcot's icon,
fits inside the aquarium with room left over.
narrator: the room left over has encouraged Disney
to develop some unique projects and multi-level exhibits,
like an indoor coral reef...
undersea robotics...
and a few surprises that most people don't even know about.
dolphins in depth gets you up close and personal
with Disney's unique family of dolphins.
okay, is everybody excited?
Yay.
okay, what we're going to do is get you all ready
for the highlight of your program.
it's as simple as putting on a wetsuit, getting in the water,
and letting the dolphin come to you.
as soon as he's nice and comfortable,
I'll give you the okay to give him a rubdown
and you're all set.
you'll learn about their behavior,
communicate using hand signals,
feel their heartbeats,
work on their training...
...and even play with them.
we have several dolphins who participate in our program,
but bob, in particular, has been with us for a long time.
he is also a rather large animal,
a stout animal, if you will,
and bob controls his environment at will.
the fish know when he is in a mood,
and will disappear from his area.
he is the king of this living seas.
so their time is in a wet suit in about waist-deep water,
learning about the adaptations that the animals have,
how they move themselves in the water, how they eat,
what their skin feels like, a wet watermelon by the way.
sometimes guests expect them to be slimy, or sandpapery,
but they're actually very smooth.
they feel very much like a wet inner tube to me.
a lot of people ask what a dolphin feels or thinks during these interaction times.
Bob typically closes his eyes and goes into a relaxed mode.
he's very trusting in presenting himself,
so he doesn't feel rigid to the touch or anything like that.
he's a big puppy dog without the fur.
our guests have told us everything from
this experience has caused a healing to them,
to others who had no idea that it would affect them this way.
once they encounter a dolphin, are hooked,
and care about that animal and their environment for the rest of their lives.
narrator: want an even closer look at those exotic fish?
then dive in.
a little-known secret
is that you can go scuba diving in the main tank.
over the last 15 years, divers have asked us, "how do we get to do what you do?
how can we spend time in that environment?
narrator: Disney has developed a special program for certified divers
called divequest.
slip on your wetsuit, mask, and tanks,
and spend 30 minutes on your own in the world's largest aquarium.
one of the unique things about Disney's divequest
is that a diver can dive for about 30 years
and not see all the animals they will be able to see in one dive here at the living seas.
you're in water temperature of 77 degrees without current,
with visibility that's unlimited
and so it is a fabulous dive that most people tell us
is something that they've never been able to achieve
in all of their years of diving.
narrator: with conditions like that,
the divers can't get enough of the abundant sea life they're able to swim with.
HOPKINS: yes, they appreciate the sharks and the fish and the turtles
and seeing the dolphins and that type of thing,
but they mostly appreciate being on stage in front of the guests
and waving through the windows.
they become part of the magic and part of the show
and to wave to your child on the other side of the glass,
and have that videotape, is just a very touching moment.
that was excellent.
narrator: after cooling off, you may want to raise that body temperature.
maybe roller coasters will get your blood going.
the Magic Kingdom's top coaster and scream maker since 1974
is space mountain,
a classic thrill ride through starry space and the cosmos.
but for the next generation of coaster buff,
disney invites you to build your own,
then take it out for a spin.
where do you go to make that happen?
a lot of people don't know
that it's right here in downtown Disney,
a waterfront entertainment complex
right in the middle of Walt Disney World.
that's where you'll find Disneyquest,
an indoor theme park that features
loads of interactive games done Disney style.
Disneyquest is an indoor interactive theme park
very unique from other theme parks
in the fact that most of our attractions are virtual.
narrator: Disneyquest offers pulse-racing adventures
like a virtual jungle cruise and pirates of the caribbean,
but the biggest draw, without a doubt, is cyberspace mountain.
Schultz: here you have the opportunity to create your own roller coaster
and once you've done that,
you can get on an f-16 flight simulator
and experience what you just created.
what you'll actually do is you'll take a boarding pass,
similar to what I have here,
and you come up to one of our design kiosks like this.
you're gonna want to slide your card in.
narrator: from there, you have three different worlds to choose from
with hundreds of different track designs you can experience.
there's a couple of different speeds also.
if you're somebody like me who like things nice and slow
you can go the nice, slow speed,
or you can also ride the ride-of-your-life speed.
narrator: every time you add a piece of track,
a different piece comes onscreen.
you can go easy, or use special track pieces,
depending on which world you're in.
all kinds of ways to lose your lunch.
want to relax after that wild ride?
perhaps you want to unwind on the high seas.
Walt Disney World may sit in the middle of Florida,
far from the nearest ocean, but believe it or not,
it's got more watercrafts than many countries,
from sailboats to speedboats and everything in between.
BRANDON: Walt Disney World has the seventh largest
marine fleet in the world, and that's everything
from the ferry boats that take guests from the parking lot to the Magic Kingdom,
to the small watercraft that guests can ride in the resorts.
they have canoes, pontoons,
you can take a boat out in the mornings and go bass fishing,
and then, of course, there's the grand I at the grand floridian.
narrator: the grand I is what they call a superyacht
48-feet of high-end luxury available for charter cruises
on the seven seas lagoon and bay lake.
the captain and first mate launch private parties
from the grand floridian marina
for breakfast cruises, bridal parties,
or any excuse to take her out on the water.
the vessel accommodates up to 16 guests
and is sumptuously fitted with three tvs, leather furniture,
Sky-lit master bedrooms with full bath and showers,
cedar lined closets,
and a fully loaded bridge right out of a spy movie.
of course, you can charter the grand I
for romantic evening dinner cruises.
sip on the finest wine.
sit back, relax,
and let your own private butler take care of your every need.
cruise the lagoon while you enjoy a breathtaking sunset...
...and celebrate a perfect evening.
the view of the Magic Kingdom from the deck of your yacht
is spectacular.
but the seven seas lagoon
isn't the only exclusive place
to view Disney's world-famous fireworks display.
millions have seen them from main street in the Magic Kingdom,
but very few know of this special place,
perched high atop the contemporary resort.
a stage-kitchen restaurant
with terrific market-inspired cuisine.
and when it's time for the Magic Kingdom fireworks,
the restaurant dims the lights, they bring up the show music,
and as for the view, it's second to none.
the Walt Disney World resort
theme parks...
water parks...
delighting and thrilling thousands all day long,
but as daylight wanes, more often than not,
our thoughts turn toward dinner.
sure, you can grab a quick bite
Walt Disney World does serve 10 million burgers a year
but did you know they also serve the best truffles emulsion
in the southeast?
at Disney's grand floridian resort,
victoria & albert's is the only five-diamond restaurant
in central Florida,
an elite, intimate, lavish, and romantic retreat.
but here's an even bigger secret
when you're looking for a completely different dining experience,
there's a way to go behind the scenes for a one-of-a-kind meal.
victoria & albert's offers a very special, and hidden,
dinner table known to very few.
it's called the chef's table.
BRANDON: Disney has all these spectacular dining experiences,
but the best, without question, and my favorite,
is the chef's table at victoria & albert's
at Disney's grand floridian,
where chef scott hunnell invites you into the kitchen
and prepares a special meal just for you.
Mr. Bennett? Welcome.
Mrs. Bennett, welcome to victoria & albert's.
Hunnell: at the start of the evening,
the guests are greeted by the maitre d'.
they're escorted right here to the kitchen,
where I am, and then they are toured to the chef's table.
good evening, welcome to the chef's table.
how are you tonight?
they get to see the full view
of the culinary creating the masterpieces,
slicing, dicing, cooking, flambing,
and all that fun stuff that you might see
in the kitchen, of course.
what I'm gonna do for you, if it's okay with you,
is just customize your menu for you this evening.
is that okay with all? Absolutely.
is there any allergies or anything you might not enjoy?
actually, seafood is the only thing.
seafood?
no seafood on the menu tonight. No problem.
narrator: as the evening progresses,
each new course brought to the table
is explained personally by the chef himself.
okay, we have some exciting things here.
and no seafood for you sir, okay.
we're gonna start with the lady over here.
that's the c. A.B. Prime filet mignon
with a composition of potatoes.
and then over here is the virginia black bass
roasted oscar style,
so it has a little dungeness crab
and a beautiful little sauce bernaise over the bottom.
narrator: and for the finale,
an elegant coffee service
and everyone's favorite, dessert
some of them almost too brilliant to ruin with your fork.
Thanks. Thank you, thank you.
glad you enjoyed everything.
well, I have for you to take home your personalized menus.
pass those down.
each and everything that we created for you this evening
is on the menu for you,
that way you don't have to remember everything you enjoyed.
narrator: after enjoying dinner at victoria & albert's,
there may be just enough time to catch a parade
across the lagoon in the Magic Kingdom.
we're all familiar
with the Disney park parades during the day,
but there's another one that a lot of people don't know about.
that's because it only comes out at night
the spectromagic parade.
Haupt: spectromagic is an amazing piece of technology.
we have over a million lights in this parade.
we have fiber-optics throughout all the floats.
we have over 250, 000 points of fiber-optic light,
which equates to about 30 miles of fiber-optic cable
throughout the parade.
we also have what we call a whirly ball,
which is used to travel 360 degrees forward and back almost simultaneously,
so we can get very close to the guests
as they're along the parade route,
so that we can entertain them directly.
narrator: spectromagic is one of a kind in the world of light shows,
designed as a moving gallery along a darkened parade route
all set to a moving musical score.
it's a nighttime spectacular unlike any other.
every float in the parade is computer controlled.
we use it to control the audio and to control the lighting.
the lighting has to stay in synchronization with the music,
and the music has to be in synchronization with the under liner that plays down the parade route,
and from float to float
as it moves down the parade route.
so what we do is we send a signal called a dtmf tone,
which is digital tone modified frequency.
this is the sound that you hear
and every float has a receiver on it,
and this is what keeps the parade in sync
as it moves down the parade route.
narrator: dtmf? Fiber-optics?
that's just the tip of the technical iceberg
that makes up spectromagic.
with light-spreading thermoplastic...
prismatic holographics...
Electroluminescence...
and military lighting developments, like quantex,
originally used in fighter planes
and now seen on the wings of dragonflies.
this is our opening float,
and this is the one where mickey makes his grand entrance into the parade
and because mickey creates the magic for the parade,
he has his own personal plasma ball at the top.
so it looks like he's creating the electrical energy
that flows throughout the parade.
the next thing we have,
is we use holographic prismatic film to break up light
and make it kinetic as it goes down the street.
it makes it very colorful.
the whole rainbow hue is created.
the other neat thing we have is what we call flow neon,
and it's sound activated, so as the music flows down the street,
it activates the lighting on the front of the float
and then the best part is
we generate smoke with liquid nitrogen.
narrator: if at the end of the day
you find yourself at the Disney-mgm studios,
stay right there
because there's something more to see that most people don't know about.
it's called fantasmic,
the most technically advanced stage show at Walt Disney World.
it all takes place under the stars,
an action-packed showdown between good and evil
with lasers...
lights...
Pyrotechnics...
dancing water...
and your favorite Disney characters and villains all set to music.
baxter: in the 90s in frontierland at Disneyland,
we developed a spectacle to end all spectacles
and we called it fantasmic.
it was so surprising and different.
it happened on water, and it used water in a new way,
that we took it to Walt Disney World,
where it has become one of the hits of the Disney-mgm studios
and every night when darkness falls in the fantasmic arena
amazing sights come about that no one has ever seen,
using water in a way
with projections and dazzling effects,
where we really challenge all your preconceptions of what you can literally do with water.
narrator: Walt Disney World -- so much to see, so much to do.
once the show is over, and the parks have closed,
there is still one more place
where adults can let the night live on.
it's called pleasure island...
...a nighttime gathering place
designed with the grown-up in mind.
wolfe: pleasure island is a part of downtown Disney
that a lot of our guests, after the parks have closed,
and even some of our locals like to come out and party.
we've got live bands, djs, a comedy club, a jazz club,
and every night, we celebrate new years eve.
narrator: among the many clubs to choose from is a place
where one of the world's only revolving dance floors
is jam-packed night after night,
and most people don't even know about it.
at mannequins, you can dance the night away.
mannequins is one of our most exciting nightclubs
here at pleasure island.
we offer our guests a very high-tech atmosphere.
that includes one of the world's largest moving dance floors,
with a lot of scenic props that come out of the ceiling,
including mannequins in different scenes.
one of the coolest features we have here is our CO2 blast.
our guests really love to get cooled down that way.
narrator: too hot for your taste?
well, just a short walk from the clubs,
but still in downtown Disney,
is something that many are surprised to find
at a Disney resort
not a traditional circus as the name implies
no tigers or dancing bears
is a theatrical experience unlike any other.
Heiden: I think that cirque du soleil is a unique type of entertainment
and some people just ask me
how would you compare it to that or that.
you can't compare it. It's such a unique thing.
it's not circus, it's not theatre, it's not movie.
it's not, you know, like a theme park.
it's a mix of circus and theatre art together.
narrator: la nouba is a feast for your eyes,
featuring nine very different acts including german wheels,
chinese yo-yos,
an aerial ballet,
and a not-so-traditional trampoline act.
I do a little acrobatics. I jump on the trampoline.
I walk the wall, flip, you know, twist,
go through the walls, jump out of the walls, have fun.
Bilodeau: the kids relate to the clowns, they relate to the colors, the costumes, the lighting,
and I think the shows in vegas are geared for adults
because it's an adult playground,
whereas at Walt Disney World, it's a children's playground.
narrator: there are those who wonder
why Disney decided to build a cirque du soleil,
not a Disney show on its property.
BRANDON: Disney has expanded.
it's looked for more evening entertainment,
and certainly with pleasure island,
there's a lot there for grown-ups.
Cirque du soleil is mystical, it's magical, it's fun.
it's a little more kid-friendly than some other cirque shows.
they have bicycle riding,
they have kid acts,
and it's just a fun, entertaining evening for a whole family.
narrator: few people realize the depth and diversity of Walt Disney World.
it's the lights, camera, action, at the Disney-mgm studios,
the lush and exotic wilderness of the animal kingdom,
epcot's fusion of technology and entertainment,
and the Magic Kingdom's persistent draw year after year,
for all ages, for all cultures.
but the resort is so much more
from waking up at dawn
to explore the african terrain on the sunrise safari...
to experiencing the rush of driving a real racecar...
and sailing Disney's seven seas lagoon on a romantic cruise.
it shows in the faces of children
as they watch a parade unlike any other.
Walt Disney began an entertainment revolution
when he laid plans for his Disney World.
as we have seen,
the opportunities he inspired seem to be endless.
so, in the years to come,
the Florida resort will continue to change and grow,
and do its best to stay ahead of the curve,
consistently updating and reinventing itself
so that there will always be an undiscovered Walt Disney world to experience.

cause who knows, it might work.
narrator: A young computer scientist named Loren Carpenter was helping them visualize what the planes might look like in flight.
carpenter: I would get the data from them and make pictures, uh, from various angles.
but I wanted to be able to put a mountain behind them, because every Boeing publicity photo in existence has a mountain behind it.
but there was no way to do mountains.
mountains had millions and millions of little triangles or polygons, or whatever you want to call it, and, uh, we had enough trouble with a hundred.
especially in those days when our machines were, uh, slower than the ones you have in your watch.
narrator: Carpenter didn't want to make just any mountains.
he wanted to create a landscape the planes could fly through;
but there was no way to do that with existing animation techniques.
from the time movies began, animators had to draw each frame by hand
thousands of them to make even a short cartoon.
: that's why they call me Thumper.
narrator: But that was before Loren Carpenter stumbled across the work of a little-known mathematician named Benoit Mandelbrot.
carpenter: In 1978, I ran into this book at a bookstore,
Fractals: Form, Chance, and Dimension by Benoit Mandelbrot, and it has to do with the fractal geometry of nature.
so I bought the book, took it home and read it
cover to cover, every last little word, including the footnotes and references-- twice.
narrator: In his book Mandelbrot said that many forms in nature can be described mathematically as fractals, a word he invented to define shapes that look jagged and broken.
he said that you can create a fractal by taking a smooth-looking shape and breaking it into pieces, over and over again.
carpenter decided he'd try doing that on his computer.
carpenter: Within in three days,
I was producing pictures of mountains on my computer at work.
the method is dead-simple.
you start with a landscape made out of very rough triangles, big ones, and then for each triangle, break it into four triangles, and then do that again, and again and again...
narrator: Endless repetition
what mathematicians call iteration.
it's one of the keys to fractal geometry.
carpenter: The pictures were stunning.
they were just totally stunning.
no one has ever seen anything like this, and I just opened a whole new door to a new world of making pictures.
and it got the computer graphics community excited about fractals because suddenly, they were easy to do.
and so people started doing them all over the place.
narrator: Carpenter soon left Boeing to join Lucasfilm, where, instead of making mountains, he created a whole new planet for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.
it was the first-ever completely computer-generated sequence in a feature film...
fascinating.
narrator: ...made possible by the new mathematics of fractal geometry.
Benoit Mandelbrot, whose work had inspired that innovation, was someone who prided himself on standing outside the mainstream.
I can see things that nobody else suspects until I point out to them.
Oh, of course, of course.
but they haven't seen it before.
narrator: You can see it in the clouds, in the mountains, even inside the human body.
the key to fractal geometry and the thing that evaded anyone until, really, Mandelbrot sort of said this is the way to look at things, is that...
if you look on the surface, you see complexity, and it looks very non-mathematical.
what Mandelbrot said was that think not of what you see but what it took to produce what you see.
narrator: It takes endless repetition and that gives rise to one of the defining characteristics of a fractal, what mathematicians call self-similarity.
the main idea is always, as you zoom in and zoom out, the objects look the same.
if you look at something at this scale...
and then you pick a small piece of it and you zoom in, it looks very much the same.
narrator: The whole of the fractal looks just like a part, which looks just like the next smaller part.
the similarity of the pattern just keeps on going.
one of the most familiar examples of self-similarity is a tree.
if we look at each of the nodes, the branching nodes of this tree, what you'll actually see is that the pattern of branching is very similar throughout the tree.
as we go from the base of the tree to higher up, you'll see we'll have mother branches and branching then into daughter branches.
if we take this one branch and node and then go up to a higher branch or node, what we'll actually find is, again, that the pattern of branching is similar.
again, this pattern of branching is repeated throughout the tree, all the way, ultimately, out to the tips, where the leaves are.
narrator: You see self-similarity in everything:
from a stalk of broccoli to the surface of the moon, to the arteries that transport blood through our bodies.
but Mandelbrot's fascination with these irregular-looking shapes put him squarely at odds with centuries of mathematical tradition.
in the whole of science, the whole of mathematics, a smoothness with everything.
what I did was to open up roughness for investigation.
DEVLIN: We used mathematics to build the pyramids, to construct the Parthenon.
we use mathematics to study the regular motion of the planets and so forth.
we became used to the fact that certain patterns were amenable to mathematics-- the architectural ones, largely the patterns of human-made structures, where we had straight lines and circles and the perfect geometric shapes.
the basic assumption that underlies classical mathematics the world that we've created, the things we've built using that classical mathematics.
the patterns in nature, the things that were already there before we came onto the planet, the trees, the plants, the clouds, the weather systems, those were outside of mathematics.
narrator: Until the 1970s, when Benoit Mandelbrot introduced his new geometry.
DEVLIN: Mandelbrot came along and said Hey, guys, all you need to do is look at these patterns of nature in the right way, and you can apply mathematics.
there is an order beneath the seeming chaos.
you can write down formulas that describe clouds, and flowers and plants.
it's just that they're different kinds of formulas, and they give you a different kind of geometry.
the big question is why did it take till the 1970s before somebody wrote a book called The Fractal Geometry of Nature.
if they're all around us, why didn't we see them before?
the answer seems to be well, people were seeing them before.
people clearly recognized this repeating quality in nature.
narrator: People like the great 19th century Japanese artist
katsushika Hokusai.
if you look well enough, you see a shadow of a cloud over Mount Fuji.
the cloud is billows upon billows upon billows.
TAYLOR: Hokusai, the great wave.
you know, on top of the great wave, there's smaller waves.
MANDELBROT: After my book mentioned that Hokusai was fractal,
I got inundated with people saying,
now we understand Hokusai.
Hokusai was drawing fractals.
TAYLOR: Everybody thinks that mathematicians are very different from artists.
I've come to realize that art is actually really close to mathematics, and that they're just using different language.
and so, for Mandelbrot, it's not about equations.
it's about how do we explain this visual phenomenon.
narrator: Mandelbrot's fascination with the visual side of math began when he was a student.
MANDELBROT: It is only in January '44 that suddenly,
I fell in love with mathematics
and not mathematics in general
with geometry in its most concrete, sensual form.
that part of geometry which...
in which mathematics and the eye meet.
the professor was talking about algebra, but I began to see in my mind geometric pictures which fitted this algebra, and once you see these pictures, the answer become obvious.
so, I discovered something which I had no clue before, that I knew how to transform in my mind instantly the formulas into pictures.
narrator: As a young man,
Mandelbrot developed a strong sense of self-reliance, shaped in large part by his experience as a Jew living under Nazi occupation in France.
for four years, he managed to evade the constant threat of arrest and deportation.
MANDELBROT: There is nothing more, um, hardening, in a certain sense, than surviving a war.
even not a soldier, but as a hunted civilian.
I knew... I knew how to act, and I didn't trust people's wisdom very much.
narrator: After the war, Mandelbrot got his Ph. D.
he tried teaching at a French university, but he didn't seem to fit in.
MANDELBROT: They say, well,
I'm very gifted, but very misled, and I do things the wrong way.
I was very much, um, a fish out of water.
so I abandoned this job in France and took the gamble to go to IBM.
narrator: It was 1958.
the giant American corporation was pioneering a technology that would soon revolutionize the way we all live:
the computer.
ibm was looking for creative thinkers
non-conformists, even rebels.
people like Benoit Mandelbrot.
MANDELBROT: In fact, they had cornered the market for a certain type of oddball.
we never had the slightest feeling of being the establishment.
narrator: Mandelbrot's colleagues told the young mathematician about a problem of great concern to the company.
ibm engineers were transmitting computer data over phone lines, but sometimes, the information was not getting through.
MANDELBROT: They realized that every so often, the lines became, uh, extremely noisy.
errors occurred in large numbers.
it was indeed an extremely messy situation.
narrator: Mandelbrot graphed the noise data, and what he saw surprised him.
regardless of the timescale, the graph looked similar.
one day, one hour, one second
it didn't matter.
it looked about the same.
it turned out to be self-similar with a vengeance.
narrator: Mandelbrot was amazed.
the strange pattern reminded him of something that had intrigued him as a young man
a mathematical mystery that dated back nearly 100 years:
the mystery of the monsters.
the story really begins in the late 19 century.
mathematicians had written down a formal description of what a curve must be.
but within that description, there were these other things, things that satisfied the formal definition of what a curve is, but were so weird that you could never draw them, or you couldn't even imagine drawing them.
they were just regarded as monsters or things beyond the realm.
abraham: They're not lines.
they're nothing like lines.
they're not circles.
they were, like, really, really weird.
narrator: The German mathematician Georg Cantor created the first of the monsters in 1883.
Ron EGLASH: He just took a straight line, and he said,
I'm gonna break this line into thirds, and the middle third I'm gonna erase.
so you're left with two lines at each end.
and now I'm gonna take those two lines, take out the middle third, and we'll do it again.
so he does that over and over again.
most people would think, well, if I've thrown everything away, eventually, there's nothing left.
not the case.
there's not just one point left.
there's not just two points left.
there's infinitely many points left.
narrator: As you zoom in on the Cantor set, the pattern stays the same, much like the noise patterns that Mandelbrot had seen at IBM.
another strange shape was put forward by the Swedish mathematician Helge Von Koch.
koch said, well, you start with an equilateral triangle, one of the classical Euclidean geometric figures, and on each side...
...I take a piece, and I substitute two pieces that are now longer than the original piece.
and for each of those pieces, I substitute two pieces that are each longer than the original piece.
over and over again.
you get the same shape, but now, each line has that little triangular bump on it.
and I break it again, and I break it again, and I break it again, and each time I break it, the line gets longer.
every iteration, every cycle, he's adding on another little triangle.
imagine iterating that process of adding little bits, infinitely many times.
what you end up with is something that's infinitely long.
narrator: The Koch Curve was a paradox.
to the eye, the curve appears to be perfectly finite.
but mathematically, it is infinite, which means it cannot be measured.
EGLASH: At the time they called it a pathological curve, because it made no sense, according to the way to a nagging measurement problem:
the length of a coastline.
the 1940s, British scientist Lewis Richardson had observed that there can be great variation between different measurements of a coastline.
it depends on how long your yardstick is and how much patience you have.
if you measure the coastline of Britain with a one-mile yardstick, you'd get so many yardsticks, which gives you so many miles.
if you measure it with a one-foot yardstick, it turns out that it's longer.
and every time you use a shorter yardstick, you get a longer number.
DEVLIN: Because you can always find finer indentations.
narrator: Mandelbrot saw that the finer and finer indentations in the Koch Curve were precisely what was needed to model coastlines.
he wrote a very famous article in Science Magazine called
how Long Is the Coastline of Britain?
narrator: A coastline, in geometric terms, said Mandelbrot, is a fractal.
and though he knew he couldn't measure its length, he suspected he could measure something else: its roughness.
to do that required rethinking one of the basic concepts in math: dimension.
what we would think of as normal geometry
one dimension is the straight line, two dimensions is, say, the box that has surface area.
narrator: And three dimensions is a cube.
but could something have a dimension somewhere in between, say, two and three?
Mandelbrot said, yes, fractals do.
and the rougher they are, the higher their fractal dimension.
DEVLIN: There are all of these technical terms, like fractal dimension, and self-similarity, but those are the nuts and bolts of the mathematics itself.
what that fractal geometry does is give us a way of looking at
in a way that's extremely precise
the world in which we live, in particular, the living world.
narrator: Mandelbrot's fresh ways of thinking were made possible by his enthusiastic embrace of new technology.
computers made it easy for Mandelbrot to do iteration
the endlessly repeating cycles of calculation that were demanded by the mathematical monsters.
MANDELBROT: The computer was totally essential.
otherwise, it would have taken a very big, long effort.
narrator: Mandelbrot decided to zero in on yet another of the monsters
a problem introduced during World War I by a young French mathematician named Gaston Julia.
DEVLIN: Gaston Julia
he was actually looking at what happens when you take a simple equation and you iterate it through a feedback loop.
that means you take a number, you plug it into the formula, you get a number out.
you take that number, back to the beginning, and you feed it into the same formula, get another number out.
and you keep iterating that over and over again.
and the question is, what happens when you iterate it lots of times.
narrator: The series of numbers you get is called a set-- the Julia set.
but working by hand, you could never really know what the complete set looked like.
abraham: There were attempts to draw it.
doing a bunch of arithmetic by hand and putting a point on graph paper.
you would have to feed it back hundreds, thousands, millions of times.
the development of that new kind of mathematics had to wait until fast computers were invented.
narrator: At IBM, Mandelbrot did something
Julia could never do:
use a computer to run the equations millions of times.
he then turned the numbers from his Julia sets into points on a graph.
MANDELBROT: My first step was to just draw mindlessly a large number of Julia sets.
not one picture, hundreds of pictures.
narrator: Those images led Mandelbrot to a breakthrough.
in 1980, he created an equation of his own, one that combined all of the Julia sets into a single image.
when Mandelbrot iterated his equation, he got his own set of numbers.
graphed on a computer, it was a kind of road map of all the Julia sets and quickly became famous as the emblem of fractal geometry...
the Mandelbrot set.
they intersect at certain areas, and it's got like a, you know...
and they have little curlicues built into them.
black beetle-like thing.
crawling across the floor.
seahorses. Dragons.
something similar to my hair, actually.
narrator: With this mysterious image,
Mandelbrot was issuing a bold challenge to long-standing ideas about the limits of mathematics.
the blinders came off, and people could see forms that were always there, but formerly were invisible.
DEVLIN: The Mandelbrot set was a great example of what you could do in fractal geometry, just as the archetypical example of classical geometry is the circle.
abraham: When you zoom in, you see them coming up again, so you see self-similarity.
you see, by zooming in, you zoom, zoom, zoom, you're zooming in, you're zooming in, and pop, suddenly it seems like you're exactly where you were before, but you're not.
it's just that way down there, it has the same kind of structure as way up here, and the sameness can be grokked.
narrator: Mandelbrot's mesmerizing images launched a fad in the world of popular culture.
MANDELBROT: Suddenly, this thing caught like... like a bush fire.
everybody wanted to have it.
DEVLIN: I thought, this is something big going on.
this was a cultural event of great proportions.
narrator: In the late 1970s, Jhane Barnes had just launched a business designing men's clothing.
Jhane BARNES: When I started my business in '76,
I was doing fabrics the old-fashioned way, just on graph paper, weaving them on a little handloom.
narrator: But then, she discovered fractals and realized that the simple rules that made them could be used to create intricate clothing designs.
BARNES: I thought, this is amazing, so that very simple concept,
I said, Oh, I can make designs with that.
but in the '80s, I really didn't know how to design a fractal, because there wasn't software.
narrator: So Barnes got help from two people who knew a lot about math and computers: Bill Jones and Dana Cartwright.
BARNES: I had Dana and Bill writing my software for me.
they said, Oh, your work is very mathematical.
and I was like, It is?
that's my weakest subject in school.
we had a physicist and a mathematician and a textile designer.
BARNES: We had so much to learn from each other.
Dana CARTWRIGHT: I did not know what a warp and a weft is.
you know, Jhane...
her ability with numbers is fairly restricted, if I can put that politely.
all, um, the parameters here...
BARNES: There was a way we were going to communicate.
we were going to get together somehow, and it really did happen pretty quickly.
the general fashion press thought Jhane's a little nuts.
they started calling me the Fashion Nerd, you know, but that was okay.
that was okay with me because I was learning a lot.
this was fun and very, very inspirational.
I'm getting things that wouldn't be possible by hand.
you know, sometimes when I think about things in my head and I say, You know, I just saw light coming through that screen door, that are happening on the ground.
can I go draw that?
no way, but I can describe that to my mathematician.
this kind of reminds me of...
he sends me back the generator, all ready for me to try, and I sit down at the computer and say,
well let's see what it's doing.
and I have parameters that I can control.
and I keep pushing, and I go,
well, this is not what I expected at all...
um, at all, but it's cool.
obi-wan KENOBI: Use the Force, Luke.
narrator: The same kinds of fractal design principles have completely transformed the magic of special effects.
Dan PIPONI: This is a key moment from Star Wars: Episode III, where our two heroes have run out ontohe end of this giant mechanical arm and the lava splashes down onto the arm.
my starting point here is to actually take the three-dimensional model and take essentially a jet and just shoot lava up into the air.
this looks kind of boring.
it's doing roughly the right thing, but the motion has no kind of visual interest to it.
let's look at what happens here when I add the fractal swirl to it.
where this becomes fractal is, we take that same swirl pattern, we shrink it down and reapply it.
we take that, we shrink it down again, we reapply it.
we shrink it down again, we reapply it.
and from here on, it's just a case of layering up more and more and more.
I've used the same technique to create these additional lava streams.
I then do it again here to get some just red hot embers.
then, we take all of those layers, and we add them up, and we get the final composite image.
my hero lava in the foreground, the extra lava in the background.
the embers, sparks, steam, smoke.
narrator: Designers and artists the world over have embraced the visual potential of fractals, but when the Mandelbrot set was first published, mathematicians, for the most part, reacted with scorn.
abraham: In the Mathematical Intelligencer, which is a gossip sheet for professional mathematicians, there were article after article saying he wasn't a mathematician;
he was a bad mathematician; it's not mathematics;
fractal geometry is worthless.
the eye had been banished out of science.
the eye had been excommunicated.
abraham: His colleagues, especially the really good ones, pure mathematicians that he respected, they turned against him.
because, see now, you get used to the world that you've created and that you live in, and mathematicians had become very used to this worl because he was bothered, and we'd talk about it.
Mandelbrot was saying,
this is a branch of geometry just like Euclid.
well, that offended them.
they said, No, this is an artifact of your stupid computing machine.
MANDELBROT: I know very well that there is this line that fractals are pretty pictures, with his new book: The Fractal Geometry of Nature.
it was filled with examples of how his ideas could be useful to science.
Mandelbrot argued that with fractals, he could precisely measure natural shapes and make calculations that could be applied to all kinds of formations, from the drainage patterns of rivers to the movements of clouds.
DEVLIN: So this domain of growing, living systems, which I, along with most other mathematicians, had always regarded as pretty well off-limits for mathematics and certainly off-limits for geometry, suddenly was center stage.
it was Mandelbrot's book that convinced us that this wasn't just artwork.
this was new science in the making.
this was a completely new way of looking at the world in which we live that allowed us not just to look at it, not just to measure it, but to do mathematics and thereby understand it in a deeper way than we had before.
as someone who's been working with fractals for 20 years,
I'm not going to tell you fractals are cool.
I'm going to tell you fractals are useful, and that's what's important to me.
narrator: In the 1990s, a Boston radio astronomer named Nathan Cohen used fractal mathematics to make a technological breakthrough in electronic communication.
cohen had a hobby: he was a ham radio operator, but his landlord had a rule against rigging antennas on the building.
Nathan COHEN: I was at an astronomy conference in Hungary, and Dr. Mandelbrot was giving a talk about the large-scale structure of the universe and reporting how using fractals is a very good way of understanding that kind of structure, which really wowed the entire group of astronomers.
he showed several different fractals that I, in my own mind, looked at and said,
Oh, wouldn't it be funny if you made an antenna out of that shape?
I wonder what it would do.
narrator: One of the first designs he tried was inspired by one of the 19th century monsters:
the snowflake of Helge von Koch.
I thought back to the lecture and said,
well, I've got a piece of wire.
what happens if I bend it?
after I bent the wire, I hooked it up to the cable and my ham radio, and I was quite surprised to see that it worked the first time out of the box.
it worked very well, and I discovered that, much of a surprise to me, that I could actually make the antenna much smaller using the fractal design, so it was, frankly, an interesting way to beat a bad rap with the landlord.
narrator: Cohen's experiments soon led him to another discovery.
using a fractal design not only made antennas smaller, but enabled them to receive a much wider range of frequencies.
Cohen: Using fractals, experimentally I came up with a very wideband antenna.
and then I worked backwards and said, Why is it working this way?
what is it about nature that requires you to use the fractal to get there?
the result of that work was a mathematical theorem that showed if you want to get something that works as an antenna over a very wide range of frequencies, you need to have self-similarity.
it has to be fractal in its shape to make it work.
now, that was an exact solution. It wasn't like,
Oh, here's a way of doing it and there's a lot of other ways of doing it.
it turned out mathematically, we were able to demonstrate that was the only technique you would use to get there.
narrator: Cohen made his discovery at a time when cell phone companies were facing a problem.
they were offering new features to their customers, like Bluetooth, walkie-talkie, and Wi-Fi, but each of them ran on a separate frequency.
Cohen: You need to be able to use all those different frequencies and have access to them without ten stubby antennas sticking out at the same time.
the alternative option is you can let your cell phone look like a porcupine.
but most people don't want to carry around a porcupine.
narrator: Today, fractal antennas are used in tens of millions of cell phones, and other wireless communication devices all over the world.
Cohen: We're going to see over the next ten to 15 to 20 years that you're going to have to use fractals because it's the only way to get, uh, cheaper costs and smaller size for all the complex telecommunication needs we're having.
MANDELBROT: Once you realize that a shrewd engineer would use fractals in many, many contexts, you better understand why nature, which is shrewder, uses them in its ways.
they're all over in biology.
they're solutions that natural selection has come up with over and over and over and over again.
narrator: One powerful example:
the rhythms of the heart.
something that Boston cardiologist Ary Goldberger has been studying his entire professional life.
ary GOLDBERGER: The notion of sort of the human body as a machine goes back through the tradition of Newton and the machinelike universe.
so somehow we're, we're machines, we're mechanisms; the heartbeat is this timekeeper.
galileo was reported to have used his pulse to time the swinging of a pendular motion.
so that all fit in with the idea that a normal heartbeat is like a metronome.
narrator: But when Goldberger and his colleagues analyzed data from thousands of people, they found the old theory was wrong.
DALENA DAMASIO COSTA: This is, um, where I show the heartbeat time series of a healthy subject.
and as you can see, the heartbeat is not constant over time.
it fluctuates, and it fluctuates a lot.
for example, in this case it fluctuates between 60 beats per minute and 120 beats per minute.
narrator: The patterns looked familiar to Goldberger, who happened to have read Benoit Mandelbrot's book.
GOLDBERGER: When you actually plotted out the intervals between heartbeats, what you saw was very close to the rough edges of the mountain ranges that were in Mandelbrot's book.
you blow them up, uh, expand them, you actually see that there are more of these wrinkles upon wrinkles.
the healthy heartbeat, it turned out, had this fractal architecture.
people said, This isn't cardiology.
do cardiology if you want to get funded.
but it turns out it is cardiology.
narrator: Goldberger found that the healthy heartbeat has a distinctive fractal pattern, a signature that one day may help cardiologists spot heart problems sooner.
please look around the screen for me.
all right, Cooper, we're going to do the calibration.
narrator: At the University of Oregon,
richard Taylor is using fractals to reveal the secrets of another part of the body: the eye.
TAYLOR: What we want to do is see what is that eye doing that allows it to absorb so much visual information.
and so that's what led us into the eye trajectories.
under the monitor which will actually monitor, where the eye is looking.
and it actually records that data.
and so what we get out is a trajectory of where the eye has been looking.
Oh, it's interesting how they go around in the patterns...
TAYLOR: And so the computer will get out this graph, and it will look, you know, have all of these various, uh, little structure in it.
and it's that pattern that we zoom in
we tell the computer to zoom in on
and, and see the fractal dimension.
narrator: The tests show that the eye does not always look at things in an orderly or smooth way.
if we could understand more about how the eye takes in information, we could do a better job of designing the things that we really need to see.
TAYLOR: light.
you're looking at the traffic light.
you've got traffic.
you've got pedestrians.
your eye is looking all over the place trying to assess all of this information.
people design aircraft cockpits, rows of dials and things like that.
if your eye is darting around based on a fractal geometry, though, maybe that's not the best way.
maybe you don't want these things in a simple row.
we're trying to work out the natural way that the eye wants to absorb the information.
is it going to be similar to a lot of these other subconscious processes?
body motion, when you're balancing, what are you actually doing there?
it's something subconscious, and it works.
and you're stringing together big sways and small sways and smaller sways.
could those all be connected together to actually be doing a fractal pattern there?
more and more physiological processes have been found to be fractal.
narrator: Not everyone in science is convinced of fractal geometry's potential for delivering new knowledge.
skeptics argue that it's done little to advance mathematical theory.
but in Toronto, biophysicist Peter Burns and his colleagues see fractals as a practical tool, a way to develop mathematical models that might help in diagnosing cancer earlier.
detecting very small tumors is one of the big challenges in medical imaging.
narrator: Burns knew that one early sign of cancer is particularly difficult to see: a network of tiny blood vessels that forms with the tumor.
like ultrasound, aren't powerful Convenenough to show them. iques,
burns: We need to be able to see structures which are just a few tenths of a millionths of a meter across.
when it comes to a living patient, we don't have the tools to be able to see these tiny blood vessels.
narrator: But ultrasound does provide a very good picture of the overall movement of blood.
is there any way, Burns wondered, that images of blood flow could reveal the hidden structure of the blood vessels?
to find out, Burns and his colleagues used fractal geometry to make a mathematical model.
burns: If you have a mathematical way of analyzing a structure, you can make a model.
what fractals do is they give you some simple rules by which you can create models.
and by changing some of the parameters of the model, we can change how the structure looks.
narrator: The model showed the flow of blood in a kidney, first through normal blood vessels, and then through vessels feeding a cancerous tumor.
burns discovered that the two kinds of networks had very different fractal dimensions.
instead of being neatly bifurcating, looking like a, a nice elm tree, the tumor vasculature is chaotic and tangled and disorganized, looking more like a mistletoe bush.
narrator: And the flow of blood through these tangled vessels looked very different than in a normal network-- a difference doctors might one day be able to detect with ultrasound.
we always thought that we have to make medical images sharper and sharper, ever more precise, ever more microscopic in their resution, to find out the information about the structure that's there.
what's exciting about this is it's giving us microscopic information without us actually having to look through a microscope.
we think that this fractal approach may be helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions in a way that hasn't been possible up to now.
narrator: It may take years before fractals can help doctors predict cancer.
but they are already offering clues to one of biology's more tantalizing mysteries:
why big animals use energy more efficiently than little ones.
that's a question that fascinates biologists James Brown and Brian Enquist and physicist Geoffrey West.
economy of scale as you increase in size.
narrator: An elephant, for example, is 200, 000 times heavier than a mouse, but uses only about 10, 000 times more energy in the form of calories it consumes.
west: The bigger you are, you actually need less energy per gram of tissue to stay alive.
that is an amazing fact.
narrator: And even more amazing is the fact that this relationship between the mass and energy use of any living thing is governed by a strict mathematical formula.
James BROWN: So far as we know, that law is universal, or almost universal, across all of life.
so it operates from the tiniest bacteria to whales and Sequoia trees.
narrator: But even though this law had been discovered back in the 1930s, no one had been able to explain it.
brown: We had this idea that it probably had something to do with how resources are distributed within the bodies of organisms as they varied in size.
we took this big leap and said,
all of life in some way is sustained by these underlying networks that are transporting oxygen, resources, metabolites that are feeding cells.
circulatory systems and respiratory systems and renal systems and neural systems.
it was obvious that fractals were staring us in the face.
narrator: If all these biological networks are fractal, it means they obey some simple mathematical rules, which can lead to new insights into how they work.
brown: If you think about it for a minute, it would be incredibly inefficient to have a set of blueprints for every single stage of increasing size.
but if you have a fractal code, a code that says when to branch as you get bigger and bigger, then, uh, a very simple genetic code can produce what looks like a complicated organism.
evolution by natural selection has hit upon a design that appears to give the most bang for the buck.
narrator: In 1997, West, Brown and Enquist announced their controversial theory that fractals hold the key to the mysterious relationship between mass and energy use in animals.
now, they are putting their theory to a bold new test:
an experiment to help determine if the fractal structure of a single tree can predict how an entire rain forest works.
measurements of its trunk...
narrator: Enquist has traveled to Costa Rica
to Guanacaste province, in the northwestern part of the country.
the government has set aside more than 300, 000 acres in Guanacaste as a conservation area.
this rain forest, like others around the world, plays a vital role in regulating the earth's climate, by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
if you look at the forest, it basically breathes.
and if we understand the total amount of carbon dioxide, that's coming into, uh, these trees within this forest we can then better understand how, uh, this forest then ultimately regulates the total amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.
narrator: With carbon dioxide levels around the world rising, how much CO2 can rain forests like this one absorb, and how important is their role in protecting us from further global warming?
enquist and a team of US scientists think that fractal geometry may help answer these questions.
...baseline.
let's try to get the height of the tree measured.
narrator: They are going to start by doing just about the last thing you'd think a scientist would do here: cut down a balsa tree.
it's dying anyway, and they have the permission of the authorities.
so Christina, as soon as you know the height of that tree, we can actually figure out the approximate angle that we need to take it down on.
narrator: Hooking a guide line on a high branch helps insure the tree will land where they want it to.
Yay!
good work.
very good.
very nice.
nice.
well done.
jose, perfecto! Esta bien?
narrator: Enquist and his colleagues then measure the width and length of the branches to quantify the tree's fractal structure.
no, that's eight.
seven on the nose.
narrator: They also measure how much carbon a single leaf contains, which should allow them to figure out what the whole tree can absorb.
so if we know the amount of carbon dioxide we can know how much carbon dioxide the entire tree is taking in.
narrator: Their next step is to move from the tree to the whole forest.
all right, this is good.
ENQUIST: We're going to census this forest.
we're going to be measuring the diameter at the base of the tree, ranging all the way from the largest trees down to the smallest trees.
and in that way we can then sample the distribution of sizes within the forest.
it's 61. 8 centimeters.
even though the forest may appear random and chaotic, the team believes it actually has a structure
one that amazingly is almost identical to the fractal structure of the tree they have just cut down.
brown: The beautiful thing is that the distribution of the sizes of individual trees in the forest appears to exactly match the distribution of the sizes of individual branches within a single tree.
narrator: If they're correct, studying a single tree will make it easier to predict how much carbon dioxide an entire forest can absorb.
when they finish here, they take their measurements back to base camp, where they'll see if their ideas hold up.
so is this the... this is the tree plot, right?
the cool thing is that, if you look at the tree, you see the same pattern amongst the branches as we see amongst the trunks in the forest. Very nic
narrator: Just as they'd predicted, the relative number of big and small trees closely matches the rer of big and small branches.
ENQUIST: It's actually phenomenal that it is parallel.
the slope of that line for the tree appears to be the same for the forest as well.
so I guess it was worth cutting up the tree.
it was definitely worth cutting up the tree.
narrator: So far, the measurements from the field appear to support the scientist's theory that a single tree can help scientists assess how much this rain forest is helping to slow down global warming.
by analyzing the fractal patterns within the forest, that then enables us to do something that we haven't really been able to do before.
have then a mathematical basis to then predict how the forest as a whole takes in carbon dioxide and, ultimately, that's important for understanding what may happen with global climate change.
narrator: For generations, scientists believed that the wildness of nature could not be defined by mathematics.
but fractal geometry is leading to a whole new understanding, revealing an underlying order governed by simple mathematical rules.
what I thought of in my hikes through forests, that, you know, it's just a bunch of trees of different sizes, big ones here, small ones there, looking like it's sort of some arbitrary chaotic mess actually has an extraordinary structure.
narrator: A structure that can be mapped out and measured using fractal geometry.
ENQUIST: What's absolutely amazing is that you can translate at you see in the natural world in the language of mathematics.
and I can't think of anything more beautiful than that.
math is our one and only strategy for understanding the complexity of nature.
now, fractal geometry has given us a much larger vocabulary.
and with the larger vocabulary we can read more of the book of nature.

in an aerial arms race...
man: MiG-15s were fast, very heavily armed.
...over 30 pilots mysteriously disappear.
man 2: They may have survived the shoot-down of their plane.
scientific detectives uncover their stories.
Oh, man.
the yellow-- the red feels a little more like
Oh look, is that chamomile tea?
what's that? - Tofu.
want to eat here? - Bean curd.
is this gonna fuck us up? - Did I order this?
cheers to a wonderful honeymoon.
Yeah.
look who's getting married.
it's like Chinese Brangelina right there.
they're doing the offerings over there.
Yeah. - Pretty cool. That's pretty cool.
this is for our healthy kids. - That's for our kids.
this is just for good will and peace around the world.
are you a fortune-teller?
Oh my God. - No way.
get out of here.
match you.
we're a match. - We're a good match?
good luck.
so how do we get out of here?
I just-- - I don't know.
I'm not a big fan of all this meat stuff. Can we just get out?
this is nuts, man. You see this?
I know. He's really beautiful.
will you take a picture of us?
good? - Oh my gosh, I want one of these.
how much is that? How much?
I got 5, that's it.
all right, this is for my girl.
