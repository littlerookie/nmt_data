can I help you? - Annie walker.
I'm here from the Smithsonian to switch out the art.
as a courtesy every term, we make pieces available
to members of the museum's board of regents...
like the senator.
but you don't have an appointment.
my office should have called ahead-- can I see?
I was hostess at the palm in Miami for two summers.
well, who do I talk to?
you must be the Smithsonian gal.
I'm Gil Jarvis. Good to meet you.
Annie Walker. Thanks for making time for me, senator.
my pleasure. But you have to thank my lovely wife Madeline.
that's her lovely desk.
she's in charge of the way things look around here.
come with me. Now, you don't want to hang around too long.
she'll try to give you a makeover.
not that you need one.
please.
she did this room. There's no wet bar.
I just think Washington has had its fill of drunken senators.
finally, a woman who's interested In something more than politics.
the Smithsonian called about you this morning. Welcome.
thank you.
senator, they're ready for you.
Ashley, this is Annie Walker from the Smithsonian.
she's gonna be taking things down and puttin' stuff up.
Hi. Ashley briggs. Chief of staff.
Hi. I have that exact same sweater.
good taste.
Annie. How do we get our hands on Wyeth's whooping crane piece?
I think it would be a perfect vertical For the reception area.
teachers union and Pakistan.
I'll find out. Andrew Wyeth.
no. N.C. Wyeth. Not the other one.
I said the whooping crane piece.
Y- you do know the collection, don't you?
actually, we have nature paintings from both Wyeths in our collection,
but I will make sure that you get the right one.
what's after the meetin'?
I need to freshen you on Pakistan, and we can do the rundown
on the way to your 5: 00 p. m.intel briefing.
excellent. Ladies. We're on our way.
somethin' with animals.
you know, I just-- I just love animals. Yeah.
you treat them like eggs!
well, they're borrowed es.
I don't want to be the one to break 'em.
Hey, Jimmy. Frederico.
Yeah, we gotta make sure custodial hits Jarvis's goods tonight.
Yeah, we got plaster on the carpet.
Oh, right, it's Tuesday.
okay, well, tell him to hit it good in the morning then.
are you from Catarina?
you know Brazil?
Catarina's a tough place.
no. It's the best city.
everyone here thinks I'm Mexican.
they try to talk Spanish to me.
portugese is my favorite language.
Frederico, what happens in senator Jarvis's office on Tuesdays?
he worked late that night.
I know he has a 5: 00 p. m. briefing, But then what?
all they say is no noisy vacuum.
Oh. So you're not allowed in there at all.
no. But they clean his office two times, on Wednesday early in the morning,
and later time tonight.
CIA headquarters
you look perplexed.
Perplexed? - Puzzled. Confused.
in need of a drink with a coworker.
I can't.
Jarvis has a secret meeting in his office Tuesday nights
after the intel briefing.
I have to find out who's invited and what goes on.
and you think you're going to find an answer doodling...
curly, twirly thingies?
Pinwheels.
no. You're right.
I have to go back, don't I?
if you want answers, you have to dig.
remember, these senators aren't gods.
they wanna be liked and they wanna succeed.
they're fallible. Just like you and me.
just don't get caught.
it's a small painting, but it's priceless.
I probably just left it on his cart.
I'll be quick. - Nope. I'm not authorized.
if we wait till morning and it's gone,
Frederico and anyone who ever stamped his time card
is gonna be held accountable.
there.
I need a swipe card duplicated so I can return the original to its rightful owner.
Spencer in I. T. - Thanks.
Oh, whoa. 'scuse me, ma'am.
hard drives you needed, sir? - Oh, yeah, thank you.
can you put them on the table? - Yes, sir.
I'm playing catcher on operation goliath.
that's for that high-threat tribal leader. What's his name?
he's holed up on a compound on the Pak-Afghan border.
I'm dealing with incoming chatter and handling logistics.
right now I am bingeing on power drinks
because, with a ten-hour time difference,
I'm gonna be here all night.
you're oddly mesmerizing.
so the legend goes.
can I ask you a question about men?
way too general a question for me to sign off on.
do most men cheat on their spouses?
where are you going with this?
my brother-in-law said he was gonna be in the office all day,
and then I saw him walk out of a hotel this afternoon.
power nap? - I'm serious.
well, maybe he had a lunch there.
at 4: 00 p. M? - I
I'm looking for an August?
Yep, right here. You from S. A.D?
Yes, sir. I've got the landsat thematic mapping you requested.
Spencer in I. T.
no, I already have e landsat calculations.
I need NGA to send me aster data. Got it?
okay. I guess he's gone.
two more senators cleared. Pack is thinning.
now we know Jarvis isn't only corruptible but vulnerable.
little too vulnerable. Nice diggin'.
I did a little on my own.
Ashley's not his first, I take it.
not even his third.
he uses cash for most of the mistress upkeep, like jewelry and vacations.
but he can't seem to resist using membership cards to get points at the restaurants.
classy.
current squeeze ashley rowed all four years at colgate.
her bank statements show membership dues at the congressional rowing club.
I'll pay her a visit, do a little girl bonding.
Oh, remember. Jarvis holds the cia purse strings.
if you're wrong about ashley briggs, it's a misfire.
if you're wrong about jarvis, We'll be lucky to get funding for Commodore 64s.
good luck.
Thanks.
thanks for that.
Hey, auggie, man, We hear it's gridlock down there.
Yeah, we did a sweep at 07ï¼š00, And the marcbot four found an ied.
they're clearing it now.
visibility? - New moon.
satellite images show there won't be any cloud cover.
a clear pitch black night. Perfect.
welcome to my world.
Hey, uh... What else you got cookin'?
who's using my itunes account?
I told you he'd figure it out.
we may have downloaded a few tunes.
congressional rowing club
the smithsonian girl. With the sweater.
Annie Walker. Yeah.
well, you can't be rowing in sneakers.
no. I was running. Well, jogging.
actually, walk/jogging. It's a good workout.
well... This is the worst part of rowing, so...
Where's an unpaid intern when you need him?
right.
Thanks.
up here? - Yeah.
you wanna get some coffee? - Yeah, sure.
remember when mom used to put little notes in our lunches?
I never got a note.
awkward.
I guess she loved me more.
Hey, hey! No hitting, girls.
um, I'm gonna try to make it home for their bedtime, but, um...
I won't keep them up.
what's the paper he's working on?
a johns hopkins study about asthma.
he seems stressed. - Yeah, poor guy.
he has to work out of the Baltimore Campus,
which adds two hours to his commute every day.
so he's in Baltimore every day?
Yeah.
Auggie. I'm filing a request with the S. A.D.
to cancel your loan to them for operation goliath.
Why? - Because I need you.
what for?
well, I can't tell you until the S.A.D. gives you back.
don't take me off of goliath. - Why?
because I need to diversify And prove my value outside the dpd.
you don't care about inter-agency politics, and you don't need to
you've got this place wired.
Joan, goliath is personal.
they're guys from my old unit.
I didn't know that.
well, it'd mean a lot to me. - Yeah. Of course.
of course, Auggie. Good luck.
so I said,"Darling, it's like sitting on the beach " trying to count the grains of sand.
all you're gonna get accomplished is getting sunburn on your shoulders and sand up your bum.
I wish I could have been there.
wishing for something has nothing to do with getting it accomplished.
excuse me, Mrs. Jarvis, I was able to locate that painting you wanted.
Oh, thank you! But can I deal with it later?
much later. We have a double date to get ready for.
art can wait.
Tina, this is Tnnie. She's from the Smithsonian.
Mrs. Varma is the wife of the indonesian ambassador.
we were vandy girls, back in the day.
and we still are. Come on, Maddie.
Oh! So Annie, I'll see you tomorrow then?
Yes, ma'am, I will see you tomorrow morning.
Hello, Tina. - Ashley.
Madeline, darling, we're late for our luncheon. We're gonna lose our reservation.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
not a fan?
she is Madeline's one-woman support group.
I suppose I shouldn't resent it, But every time they go out,
the Florida taxpayers foot the bill.
tax dollars at work.
and guess who has to justify it on the expense report?
how 'bout we go rack up our own bill?
we'll have another beer.
Oh, and I'll have yet another margarita.
please. And hold the salt.
did you know this place was a hangout for spooks?
like CIA?
at least we'll know the guys are full of crap.
what is it about this town?
everybody here parties like they're still in college.
we need it. Our days are pressure-filled.
you got a lotta steam to let off.
you think Tina Varma and Madeline Jarvis are on their third round by now?
what?
Tina varma is a gold digger.
she married ambassador Varma Because when they go to indonesia for his home visits,
she gets treated like royalty,
and here she gets to live on other people's expense accounts.

Oh... - So romantic.
wait. He wants to come over now?
now. He's 25.
he expects me to go over there!
I just throw the young ones back.
I think senator Jarvis likes you.
w- why do you say that?
I don't know, it's just like... The way he looks at you.
it's nice, like he really respects you.
he probably wishes he wasn't married.
cone of silence? - Of course.
their marriage is not what it seems.
he told me.
he's lonely. - Well, I...I think he was.
lonely, I mean.
you are in love with him?
Oh, my
he is...Amazing.
he's so sweet, funny, and the most brilliant man I have ever met.
he's gonna leave her After the election.
when do you have time to get together?
every Tuesday night.
and Sunday afternoon, we have a sort of...Date.
that's the most washington thing I've ever heard.
you schedule your affair!
can we see a menu? Please?
and can we get like some chips and salsa? Thanks.
Ashley copped to the affair, and I think...
if she were the leak, She wouldn't breathe a word of it, right?
well, not necessarily. How drunk did you get her?
she got there all on her own. Hey, can you run a name for me?
Yeah. - Tina varma.
she's the wife of the indonesian ambassador.
maybe joan's right. Maybe senator jarvis is being blackmailed.
that's a big leap. And it requires indisputable proof.
indisputable. Got it.
I deeply regret that Ms. Briggs allegedly sold secrets to a foreign govenment.
I just emailed you a draft of a memo I found in madeline's desk.
she must have written it.
it's a resignation speech from the senator.
he says he's gonna quit because ashley sold our secrets.
Jai, the senator's not the leak. Ashley's not the leak.
his wife's the leak.
and she's gonna frame ashley for it.
is that indisputable enough for ya?
Annie, you just hooked a whale.
the White House wants to be read-in on this In real time, Joan.
how'd she do it? How'd she access this information?
you'll know when I know.
what's your game plan? Are you on top of all the
on top of a leak from the head of the senate intelligence committee?
for christ's sake, Marty. We're the head of this investigation.
I'm not doing this jurisdictional pissing match with you.
can we get some coffee? - Our people will tail madeline jarvis.
when she hands off more intel, We will discreetly bring her in.
then we will turn her.
she will work for us.
she will feed bogus traceable intel to her contacts, whoever they may be.
we're going to let her contacts walk away.
Marty, when you're in charge of an investigation,
you can say book 'em and round up whoever you want.
but right now, we're gonna follow this pipeline of information as far as we can,
so that when we do a takedown, we make sure we get everyone.
now, at 50 meters to the structure, You split into three teams
one at the southwest corner, one at the northwest corner,
and the other to the front.
and we suspended all flybys for those 20 minutes.
we have a convoy of backup vehicles in peshawar At the ready.
Hey, we are good to go, bro.
I'm ready to start chilling with my $62' worth of country music you bought me.
come on, man. Not even bluegrass?
straight up american country. Hoo!
later, bro. - yeah.
my brother-in-law is definitely lying to my sister.
how do you know?
he said he was gonna be in Baltimore all day,
then I saw him walk out of a hotel in D.C.
well, maybe she knows, and she's just looking the other way.
the woman who knows and looks the other way Is an urban myth.
what's up with you?
nothing.
you're... Usually funnier.
S.A.D. Wants nasir alive. That's the imperative based on the newest chatter.
he has a cell in turkey, And I'm stuck at a desk at the dpd
trying to help my guys pull off a pretty tricky mission.
you're gonna nail it.
you weren't on the call when they found out I was point man.
I heard the hesitation in their voices.
your sense of hearing is overdeveloped.
those guys love you like a brother,
and you are very, very good at your job.
since when did you start giving inspirational speeches?
since you went on loan to the S.A.D.
cabbie is en route to the capitol grill.
Yeah.
taxi.
taxi.
you're supposed to be chained to your desk an hour from here.
it's not what you think.
well, I wanna know what it really is, But not right now.
please. Don't say anything to danielle.
now, I know this has been hard on you, Maddie,
but you couldn't just sit on your hands.
trust me, we'll come through on our part.
good-bye, darling.
scuse me. I don't think my lunch date's gonna show.
I'm sorry for taking up the table.
Mrs. Jarvis? - Annie!
please, come, sit down.
did you just get here?
I haven't paid yet. I could get you something.
thank you. I won't be long.
is there a problem at the museum?
don't tell me we're not getting the Wyeth.
Mrs. Jarvis, I'm not... from the Smithsonian.
of course you are. - No. I'm afraid I'm not.
what are you talking about?
I need you to come with me to Langley.
Langley?
there are some people there who need to talk with you.
there's a car waiting out front.
I'm calling my attorney.
if you call your lawyer, this becomes a legal matter with public documents.
or we can handle it discreetly.
we're bringing in your husband now.
we need to know what you passed, Madeline-- all of it.
I have field agents and operatives Whose lives hang in the balance here,
not to mention ashley briggs, whose life
it wasn't my idea... To pin it on ashley.
was it Tina Varma's?
she said I needed to take my life back Into my own hands.
she told me no one would get hurt.
and you believed her.
I worked as a teacher to put Gil through law school.
we built his career together.
I stood by his side through the county elections And the state elections...
endless fundraisers and speeches.
all for the dream we had together. - Until he cheated on you.
he changed.
his priorities changed.
just for a moment, let's be two women...
who are married to powerful men, okay?
what your husband did to you is terrible.
but what is really crushing
is that pushing Ashley Briggs out of the way wouldn't solve anything.
because another woman would just come along.
and that's why you did it, isn't it?
because you wanted to hurt him irreparably.
you wanted to kill his career.
I just wanted him To come back home with us to gainesville.
I wanted it to be like it was when we first got married.
that's not a marriage. That's a honeymoon.
Ashley was the last mistress Madeline jarvis was willing to tolerate.
now you have to tell ashley to take the fall.
excuse me?
the Indonesians need to believe that their plan is up and running.
that way we can use madeline to feed false information And trace where it goes.
Ashley has to be taken into custody for espionage, Annie.
we're gonna give her a new life.
all she did was get involved with the wrong guy.
who was married. Who was her boss.
think of her as a cautionary tale.
workplace romances always complicate it, Annie, no matter how common it is.
we are go/no go fellas. Stay frosty.
I have to tell a perfectly nice girl That one bad romance has ruined her name.
your sister? - No.
but I like where your head's at.
Oh, uh, I would love to hear about your mission, but not today
Goliath's in position.
yeah? - Yeah!
today, Annie w\Walker, I am a...Closer.
Thanks. - For what?
you're all fired up when those guys are depending on you to be.
so what are you thanking me for?
for inspiring me to look at the bigger picture.
Ashley? - Hey, Annie.
we need to talk.
tell me none of this is happenin'.
I told tina about all the affairs... You had, Gil.
so many years of lies.
Ashley was the final straw for me.
but Tina promised me no one would get hurt.
honey, how could she promise you anything?
she did not know what the hell she was doin'.
it was just scraps of information.
if it was just scraps of information...
you wouldn't be sitting here.
Joan, can I talk with you outside?
what are you doing? I was in the middle of
if the Indonesians frame ashley, She'll contest it in court.
it'll be messy. Public.
right. Right. She's a loose end.
so they frame her, then they get rid of her.
make it look like an accident or a suicide.
I sent Annie to the rowing club. She's bringing her in right now.
you're telling me to call in backup, right?
this is the moment You choose to appreciate the chain of command? Go.
Madeline Jarvis has been passing state secrets to the Indonesian government.
she's at langley now being debriefed.
she was gonna frame you for treason, Ashley.
that's impossible. - No, it's not.
it's sick, but it's not impossible.
how?
and how would she convince anyone that I did it?
you took handwritten notes when he came back from intelligence briefings.
senator Jarvis had you compare missions estimates
with back-of-the-envelope calculations you could find.
he'd have you find the cost of, say, a helicopter.
in the event that it was destroyed during an operation, It needed to be replaced.
but it meant he was revealing pieces of highly protected information.
all she had to do was compare your handwritten notes
and your history of internet searches.
and the only evidence of any leak or notes... In my handwriting.
right.
Madeline told me she sold intel On four fully funded missions
operation cauldron, Operation side alley,
operation goliath, And operation blackjack.
keep me apprised of the sandstorm.
if it picks up any more velocity-- - Auggie.
operation goliath might be compromised.
it's too late. - Why?
Goliath is on. They went radio silent 20 minutes ago.
I trusted you. I know.
it was my job to get you to trust me.
no.
your job is to trick people and ruin their lives.
what you do for a living Is far worse than anything I've ever done.
there are lives at stake, Ashley.
put another ask in Peshawar.
get us a location on kiev four.
we need sustained visuals that we can't get From our surveillance drones.
so we're gonna piggyback onto a russian satellite.
kiev four should do it. - Nothing, Auggie.
when was your last contact with base camp?
17 minutes ago.
they're walking right into it.
the special ops unit is approaching the compound.
we're out of options.
no, we're not. Kill the drone.
what? - Smash it into the compound.
it's a warning. I know my guys. They'll know what it means.
okay. Do it. - Copy that.
when the drone hits the compound, The unit should radio in the aborted mission, right?
they should. If they don't, it means either the drone hit my guys
or they were ambushed by Nasir's men.
direct hit. The explosion's from inside the compound.
it was booby-trapped.
this is alpha. We're aborting mission goliath.
repeat-- aborting mission goliath.
copy that.
you okay?
just take nice, easy breaths.
that's gonna hurt for a while.
I don't wanna disappear.
you don't have to take the fall.
there's no game anymore. - I don't understand.
the agency wanted to follow the fake intel up the food chain
with him in custody, Tina Varma knows Madeline's working for us.
I don't have to give up my life?
no.
but the one I have will never be the same.
no. It won't.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I have always considered myself a patriot...
an honest man.
it is, indeed, a terrible thing...
to realize that you have deceived yourself.
it's not an affair.
I lost my job at Brookings two months ago.
I didn't want to tell Danielle.
that explains you coming out of a hotel?
it was a job fair, Annie.
I've got a phd in healthcare policy, and I'm handing out resumes in a ballroom.
we're living on savings now.
what am I supposed to tell her? - The truth.
my sister's a better person than you're giving her credit for.
I don't want to lose her. - Then don't lie to her.
my wife faces charges of treason.
my chief of staff faces public shame And damage to her career that cannot be undone.
and so I humbly apologize...
to my wife, to my chief of staff,
my constituents, my supporters,
and to the country that I love...
but am no longer worthy to serve.
my resignation is immediate,
my shame...
unending.
and I can only pray that at some point in the future...
you find the power to forgive.
what are you gonna do when you run outta gas, caII AAA?
you sucker for the babes, you.
you ain't even gonna make it to the pits.
you shut the heII up. I'II make it.
not unIess you keep your eyes on the road, sugar pie.
watch it!
Ah, this is great.
just Iike being in a buddy movie.
shut up!
boy, you're screwed. You're out. You're finished.
stick a fork in it. You're swirIing around the bottom of the bowI, nose-diving down the pipe.
Oh. It's over.
you're fIushed.
this time, I can't bring myseIf to teII him to shut up.
sure, he's an asshoIe.
sure, he's dead.
sure, I'm just imagining that he's taIking.
none of that stops the bastard from being absoIuteIy right.
I don't have a chance in heII of outrunning this cop.
not in this heap.
puII over!
the onIy question Ieft is whether I'm gonna kiII him or not.
tough caII.
for aII I know, he's an honest cop, reguIar guy, a working stiff with a mortgage, a wife and a piIe of kids.
my hand moves aII on its own, sIiding one of my guns to my Iap and thumbing back the hammer.
I don't know what to do. - You better stop. You're making him mad.
whatever you say.
your friend here... party a IittIe too hard tonight?
I'm the designated driver.
weII, you're driving with a busted taiI Iight.
I'II Iet you off with a warning.
what next?
the tank goes dry a quarter mile from the pits.
I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.
a few minutes' more work and it'll all be over.
Jackie Boy will go into the damn tar pits.
I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks. go home and call it a...
no more questions, DaIIas. Do what I say.
cIear the streets. We're in Iockdown.
we're not seIIing any taiI in OId Town.
not tonight.
don't struggIe. You'II onIy hurt yourseIf.
your cause is Iost.
we know everything.
soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty wiII be in our possession, and the truce between your prostitutes and the poIice wiII be shattered.
There'II be arrests. There'II be deaths.
my empIoyer wiII seize what remains of this neighborhood.
you wiII aII be sIaves. Nothing can stop this.
but it is within your power to save many Iives by faciIitating the process of transition, by negotiating the terms of the surrender of OId Town.
son of a bitch! I know you.
I have suffered your kind before - the dregs of Sin City.
I serve a new master now, and soon you and aII your wretched kind wiII serve him as weII.
now, get dressed and shed a tear for Dwight McCarthy if you must, because, by now, he is sureIy dead.
you don't know him.
my man wiII find a way.
he aIways finds a way.
I can't fathom these Americans aIways whining and going on about how they got it so bad.
this is a fine, grand country.
guiding Iight of the modern worId, it is.
low taxes, Iand of opportunity.
where eIse wouId one buIIet buy us the fortune that we're getting for this?
sure beats the Iiving heII out of bIowing up airports and churches without shite to show for it.
Yeesh.
you find something, Murphy?
looks to be our poor, dead cop's badge.
it's aII bent up.
what's this stuck in it?
bIoody heII. It's the buIIet.
you son of a bitch! Bastard!
they weren't cops. these four.
they were mercenaries.
and if they were hired by who I think they were.
the bad times haven't even started yet.
and everything seemed to be going so well.
remember, we don't have to deIiver every Iast inch of the man, Brian.
you got a good point there, Ronnie.
lend me your knife.
shouId I take a nap whiIe I'm doing aII this waiting?
I'm at the bone, aII right?
there we go.
have you ever seen anything so pretty in your whoIe Iife?
we'II be back for the three of you, and if anyone happens by, use your imagination, OK?
silence. now.
no air to breathe.
only the horrid. oily tar taste creeping up my nostrils.
let it in. Let it fill your lungs.
they were counting on you and you blew it.
skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.
Miho. you're an angel.
you're a saint.
you're Mother Teresa.
you're Elvis.
you're God.
and if you'd shown up ten minutes earlier. we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.
Dwight, they got GaiI!
it's a cinch. You got yourseIves a spy in OId Town.
a stooIie who soId you out to the mob.
we gotta find out who it is and rescue GaiI.
but first, we gotta get our hands on Jackie Boy's head before it gets to wherever it's going and this whoIe situation bIows wide open.
miho, I hope to heII you Ieft one of 'em aIive enough to taIk.
I let him know I'm not fooling around.
we talk.
stay smart. Stay cool.
it's time to prove to your friends that you're worth a damn.
sometimes. that means dying.
sometimes. it means killing a whole lot of people.
there they are. What do we do?
we stop 'em, DaIIas.
Jackie Boy's head is so close to me
I could almost reach out and grab it right then and there.
get the head! Get the head!
I got it! I got it!
suck on this, you stupid sIag!
I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead.
but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me wants to get some killing done.
you want the head now, sweetheart? So come down and get it!
brave Iad.
I couId've put a buIIet straight down your ear just now, if I hadn't got me revoIver aII wet and useIess.
you got the drop on me, Iove.
I'm as heIpIess as a baby.
I got to come cIean with you, sweetheart.
it was an outright Iie I was giving ya about me revoIver being wet.
you see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.
it's my preference to bIow things up.
once you bIast the roof off a pub and seen aII the parts fIying off peopIe, a IittIe bang bang's never gonna match the sight of that.
and here's me, with aII these fine grenades and such a sweet beauty of a remote.
but it's me knife I'II be doing you with.
you kiIIed me mates.
someone shouIda toId ya - never give an Irishman good cause for revenge.
deadly little Miho.
you won't feel a thing unless she wants you to.
she twists the blade.
he feels it.
I tell Miho what we're gonna do and how we're gonna do it.
I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make the most important call of my life.
first. We gotta rescue Gail. then comes the kill.
the big. fat kill.
do we just gotta stand here and watch this?
what, are you kidding me, man?
I couId watch oId Manute do his thing aII night Iong and not get tired of it.
I mean, the man's an artist.
onIy an artist shouId be aIIowed to touch such a beautifuI subject.
your skin is perfect.
your nerves, responsive.
beautifuI.
just give them what they want, GaiI.
Becky? - It's over, GaiI.
there's no fighting them. Dwight's dead.
they got what's Ieft of that cop we kiIIed.
the mob's gonna turn it over to the poIice chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.
we gotta cut a deaI.
you IittIe bitch! You soId us out!
I didn't have no choice! They was gonna hurt my mom.
you gotta cut a deaI with these peopIe.
it's seIfish, you hoIding out Iike this.
you're gonna get a Iot of girIs kiIIed for no good reason.
it wasn't your mom!
we couId have protected her and you know it.
it was the money, you stupid IittIe bitch!
sure, there's money. Sure, you couId've moved my mom into OId Town and Iet her know that her daughter's a goddamn whore.
breaks your heart, doesn't it?
they offered me what you couIdn't never offer me - a way out.
I had to watch out for my own neck.
your neck.
your precious, scrawny IittIe neck!
you're crazy! You couId have ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!
schutz, fetch my bIades.
Stuka, kiII this one. - No, I was promised!
stupid IittIe bitch! You deserve worse!
I knew there was a reason I got out of bed this morning.
Hey.
Hey.
nobody. I don't see nobody.
wiII you Iook at that? It's right through me. Guys, Iook.
there's something wrapped around it.
some kind of note.
give it to me.
it's poked right through me. Guys, Iook.
it's starting to reaIIy hurt. - Out back. Everyone.
and bring the women.
do you think somebody shouId caII me a doctor or something?
mccarthy, you fooI.
Hey.
guys?
Aw.
dozens of them. armed to the teeth.
I'm outnumbered. outgunned.
but the alley is crooked. dark and very narrow.
they can't surround me.
sometimes. you can beat the odds with the careful choice of where to fight.
you can have OId Town, I don't care.
just give me the woman.
shut up.
Dwight, don't do this.
Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right. - Shut up, or I'II pIug you!
of course, Mr. McCarthy. A fair trade.
she's aII yours.
now, if you'II expIain to me why we shouIdn't bIow both of you to pieces...
Dwight, what have you done?
exactIy what I had to.
every step of the way.
No! It isn't right! There wasn't no tape over his mouth!
how come there's tape over his mouth?
where to fight counts for a lot.
cute trick, McCarthy, but it wiII do you do good.
but there's nothing like having your friends show up with lots of guns.
No! McCarthy, you shit!
the girls all know the score.
no escape. no surrender. no mercy.
we gotta kill every last rat bastard one of 'em.
every last one.
not for revenge. not because they deserve it.
not because it'll make the world a better place.
we need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over his charts of profits and losses.
he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of Old Town.
they run out back.
right on schedule.
deadly little Miho.
she gets her practice in.
the Valkyrie at my side is shouting and laughing with the pure. hateful. bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter.
and so am I.
the fire. baby.
it'll burn us both.
there's no place in this world for our kind of fire.
my warrior woman. my Valkyrie.
you'll always be mine.
always...
and never.
just one hour to go. My last day on the job.
early retirement. Not my idea.
doctor's orders. Heart condition.
'Angina. " he calls it.
I'm polishing my badge and getting myself used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.
it and the 30-odd years of protecting and serving and tears and the blood and terror and triumph it represents.
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.
about the thick. fat steaks she picked up at the butcher's today.
and I'm thinking about the one loose end I haven't tied up.
a young girl who's out there somewhere. helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.
damn it, Hartigan, I won't Iet you do this. You're gonna get yourseIf kiIIed.
you're gonna get us both kiIIed. I won't Iet you. I'm warnin' you.
let go of my coat, Bob.
you're draggin' me down with you.
I'm your partner. They can kiII me, too.
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin' on the horn and caIIing for backup.
sure, Bob. We'II just wait.
sit on our hands whiIe that Roark brat gets his sick thriIIs with victim number four.
victim number four!
Nancy CaIIahan, age 1 1 .
and she'II be raped and sIashed to ribbons.
and that backup that we're waitin' on wiII just so happen to show up just Iate enough for Roark to get back to his US Senator daddy.
take a deep breath, Hartigan.
settIe down and think straight.
you're pushin' 60 and you got a bum ticker.
you ain't savin' anyone.
you got a great attitude, Bob.
reaI credit to the force, you are.
EiIeen's at home waitin' for you. Think about EiIeen.
heck, Bob, maybe you are right.
I'm gIad to hear you're finaIIy taIkin' sense.
hell of a way to end a partnership.
hell of a way to start my retirement.
Nancy Callahan. age 1 1.
for all I know. she's dead already.
you've been a very good girI, Nancy.
you've been very quiet.
don't be scared.
we're gonna be taking you home reaIIy soon.
but first, we're going to introduce you to somebody.
he's a very nice man.
halfway to the warehouse where Weevil said they took her. and it hits.
wicked spot of indigestion.
at least that's what I pray it is.
...Iighthearted and momentary digression.
the briefest induIge-ment in automotive pIeasure.
for cheap thriIIs. Such short-Iived durabiIity, Mr. ShIubb.
you wouId risk engender-ating iII wiII on the part of our empIoyers.
Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump
two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs with delusions of eloquence.
this Jaguar you so pinheadedIy covet
temporariIy remanded to our custody though it may be
remains the property of the son of Senator Roark.
gotta keep this quiet. Take 'em down fast.
a singIe dent, the merest scratch thereupon, and the before-mentioned consequences of which I so recentIy made mention shaII sureIy be athwart us.
catch your breath. Give your heart time to slow down.
but it won't slow down.
get over it.
she needs you.
we're aII done here, Benny.
let's give them some time together. Give them some privacy.
be with you in a minute, Lenny.
I'm just making sure they get aIong reaIIy weII.
and what kind of beast couIdn't get aIong with a precious IittIe girI Iike this?
you must be awfuIIy scared now.
but you've got nothing to be scared of.
aII we're gonna do is have a nice IittIe taIk.
that's aII. Just a nice taIk. Just you and me.
don't you cry now.
doctor said it'd be like this.
just take the pill he gave you.
no need to play it quiet.
not anymore.
breathe steady. old man. Prove you're not completely useless.
what the hell? Go out with a bang.
he likes to hear 'em scream.
I've seen his victims and their twisted little faces.
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed. frozen in their last horrible moment of living.
no screams. Either I'm just in time. or I'm way too late.
Ooh!
it's nothing. Barely a flesh wound. On your feet. old man.
Roark. Give it up.
let the girI go.
you can't do a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.
you know who I am.
you know who my father is!
you can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.
look at you. You can't even Iift that cannon you're carrying.
sure, I can.
cover your eyes, Nancy. I don't want you watching this.
I mean it, baby. Cover your eyes right now.
I take his weapons away.
both of them.
hell of a way to end a partnership.
for God's sakes, don't make it any worse.
don't make me kiII you. - Doin' fine, Bob.
never better.
I'm ready to kick your ass.
keep him talking. Buy time.
just a few more minutes. Just till the backup gets here.
sit down and stay down. I'II kiII you if I have to.
keep his mind off the girl - skinny little Nancy.
he can't kill her once the backup gets here.
run home, Nancy. Run for your Iife.
Hey. Don't Iisten to him. He's a crazy man.
what a tough man you are, huh? - You stay right where you're at.
you shoot your partner in the back...
then you try to scare a IittIe girI.
maybe I'II puII my spare rod, pIug you a coupIe of times, show you how it's done.
we couId've worked something out, but you've bIown that.
sit down or I'II bIast you in haIf.
you're so sIow, you'II never stop me. - Sit down!
you'II never be abIe to stop me.
I finally sit down. just like you told me to.
the sirens are close now.
she'll be safe.
things go dark. I don't mind much.
getting sleepy. It's OK.
she'll be safe.
an old man dies.
a little girl lives.
fair trade.
just teII me it isn't true, John.
what they're saying about you and that chiId.
it can't be true.
if you ever want to see me again...
say something now.
we're Iooking at your basic mountain of DNA evidence, the testimony of your own partner, corroboration by six eye-witnesses - and that's just so far
and there's your own siIence.
I'II do what I can, but needIess to say, you are good and screwed.
come on, Hartigan. What's hoIding you back?
what's shutting you up? This whoIe thing stinks to high heaven.
I'm not the onIy one on the force who smeIIs it.
sure, I'II rinse your bedpan and wipe your butt. That's my job.
but don't expect any friendIy chitchat outta me, mister.
I heard what you've done to that girI. I hope they throw away the key.
evenin', officer.
I don't have to introduce myseIf, do I? You read the papers.
this being an eIection year, you've seen pIenty of my picture.
you know who I am and what I can do.
and I'm doin' you, Hartigan.
coid and hard, I'm doing you.
you bIew my son's ear off.
you bIew his arm off. You even bIew his nuts and his pecker off.
he's in a coma right now. They say he may never come out of it.
my boy.
he couId've been the first Roark to become the President of the United States, but you went and turned him into a brain-damaged, dickIess freak.
PuIIin' that trigger make you feeI powerfuI?
power don't come from a badge or a gun.
power comes from Iying.
lying big, and gettin' the whoIe damn worId to pIay aIong with you.
once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain't true, you've got 'em by the baIIs.
there's what, maybe 500 peopIe in this hospitaI?
I couId pump you fuII of buIIets right now, and I wouIdn't even be arrested.
everyone wouId Iie for me - everyone who counts.
otherwise, aII their own Iies - everything that runs Sin City
it aII comes tumbIing down Iike a pack of cards.
but I want you firm and fit and heaIthy.
I'm even putting up cash of my own to get you more surgery.
fix that heart condition of yours.
you're gonna keep on Iiving a Iong time. I'm gonna make sure of that.
you're gonna be convicted of raping that IittIe brat, and shooting my boy.
and you're gonna spend the rest of your Iife in prison, disgraced, destroyed...
aIone.
your wife?
you teII her the truth and she's dead.
you teII anybody the truth and they're dead.
they won't Iet me testify.
I toId the cops that you saved my Iife and they just acted Iike I was crazy.
they taIked my parents into keeping me away.
they said that you'd done things that you didn't do.
I toId them that you saved me from that Roark creep, but they won't even check me out to see that I'm stiII a virgin.
I'm stiII a virgin, stiII aIive - thanks to you.
they got it aII backwards.
sometimes, the truth doesn't matter Iike it ought.
but you'II aIways remember things right.
that's gonna mean a Iot to me.
but stay away, Nancy. They'II kiII you if you don't stay away.
don't visit me.
don't write me.
don't even say my name.
maybe you won't Iet me visit, but I'II stiII write to you, Hartigan.
I'II sign my Ietters " CordeIia. "
that's the name of a reaIIy cooI detective in books I read.
I'II write you every week... for forever.
sure, kid.
now, run on home.
it's not safe for you here.
Bye, Nancy.
I Iove you.
John Hartigan.
Mr. Law and Order.
Mr. By the Book.
Mr. High and Mighty.
I gotta give you credit, being such a straight arrow for so damn many years without it catching up with you.
it's catching up with you now, friend of mine.
it's catching up with you but good.
maybe I oughta Iook at him. He doesn't Iook too good.
Ohh, he's haIe and hearty, Tammy. See?
he's the picture of heaIth.
that Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?
I rented her out of OId Town.
I wanted to show you what you won't be getting any of, not in prison.
you hear me, Hartigan?
if you stop being stupid, start pIaying aIong with us, you might just get some of Tammy.
you see that? She fIinched.
you make her sick.
she heard about you and that IittIe girI.
this is nothing but a price I promised myself I'd pay. and I'm paying it.
you don't save a little girl's life. then turn around and throw her to the dogs.
not in my book. you don't.
they want a confession. They won't get it.
there was a letter from Nancy waiting when they put me in solitary.
she calls herself " Cordelia. " just like she promised.
she makes no mention of anything that would give her away.
at first. I figure she'll send another note or two before her young mind moves on to better things.
but every Thursday. another one arrives.
what a sweet kid.
I do my best to keep my hand from shaking when I reach for it.
she's the only friend I've got - the daughter I never had.
my sweet Cordelia.
skinny little Nancy Callahan.
eight years pass.
then comes a Thursday when I bound from my cot.
excited as a kid at Christmas.
only to find myself staring at the damn floor of my damn cell.
looking for a letter from Nancy that isn't there.
then another Thursday with no letter.
is she all right?
did something happen to her?
nothing.
two months now - not a word from Nancy.
did they find her? Did they get to her?
of course! Stupid old man.
do your math. Nancy's 1 9 years old.
how long did you expect her to keep writing?
she was a saint to keep it up as long as she did.
she's forgotten you. old man.
you're alone.
you're all alone.
this guy smells awful - like bad food.
like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster in the middle of summer.
he stinks so bad. I want to throw up.
practically knocked my head off. the bastard.
when I come to. I see it.
the same kind of envelope Nancy always uses.
but there's no letter inside of it.
there's something soft.
something that ought to be alive - a hunk of meat and bone that ought to be the index finger of the right hand of a 1 9-year-old girl.
how the hell did they find her?
she was so careful.
she never gave away where she lives or where she works.
I've got to get out. I've got to help her.
nothing else matters - not my life and not my pride. either.
it's only one final surrender they want.
you got me. Roark. You beat me.
I'II get it, CIaire. That'II be Marv.
he never sIeeps. He's aIways getting himseIf in deep.
yeah?
what?
Hartigan. My God, it is you.
Yes, yes...
I'II get right on it. Right this second.
I'II be there by ten, I promise.
Lucille. She wouldn't give up on me back before the trial.
she almost slugged me when I stopped her from hiring a new attorney.
when I refused to plead innocent. she did slug me.
if she hears what I'm gonna do. she'll probably slug me again.
Hartigan... Hot damn.
it's Iike they were waiting for my caII.
they're ready to deaI. They're practicaIIy begging for a deaI.
they're scared of something.
one of them as much as promised me paroIe if you confess and express regret and aII that other dumb crap that, of course, we won't go for.
we're getting you out for time served, with no strings attached.
then we're gonna sue those sorry sons of bitches for faIse prosecution.
you're gonna be exonerated, and a very rich man.
this isn't Iike you think it is. - The heII it isn't.
anyone can figure out who framed you, but even Senator Roark isn't God.
you hung up the phone too soon. - We use the Iaw, the press...
he wiII never know what hit him. - I'm gonna confess.
excuse me?
John Hartigan, crawIing on his beIIy in front of a paroIe board?
confessing to raping a IittIe girI and bIubbering for mercy?
no, doesn't work.
I'm going in there teIIing them I'm a twisted, wretched chiId moIester, agreeing to anything they want from me.
aII right, you son of a bitch.
let's get this over with.
I say everything they want to hear. just the way they want to hear it.
I tell them I'm a twisted. wretched child molester.
I agree to everything they want from me.
I love you. Nancy.
it's a Iot of miIes into town, Hartigan.
you care for a ride? - Long as you stay in front of me.
prison's made you paranoid. TaIk about water under the bridge.
Christ.
eight years.
Yeah. Eight years.
weII, if it's any consoIation to you...
you made me hate myseIf.
any word from EiIeen? - Yeah.
well. She got remarried four years ago.
she had two kids. I'm sorry, John.
don't be.
I'm gIad.
EiIeen aIways wanted kids.
she'II make a good mother.
like you said, Bob - water under the bridge.
Bob and I get on with our fond farewells to each other.
then I go looking for the only human being on the planet who means a damn to me
Nancy.
how could they have found out it was you writing all those letters to me?
how did they find out who you are?
and what have they done to you. baby?
not a sound.
no sign of life.
has Roark gone to all this trouble just to torture a broken old man.
like a kid poking at a fly when he's already torn his wings off?
what has he done to Nancy?
it's like all she ever does is read and study and write.
no diary. no phone numbers or addresses written down anywhere.
closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.
it's a long shot. but maybe she's got some friends there.
a dead end.
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do with a pack of drunks and losers like this.
but if there's anything to be found here. the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is or whoever kidnapped her and mutilated her. this is the place.
excuse me, miss. Wondering if you couId heIp me. I'm Iooking for somebody.
coid night Iike this, everybody's Iooking for somebody, stranger.
it's not Iike that. Her name is Nancy.
eyes to the stage, piIgrim.
she's just warming up.
skinny little Nancy Callahan.
she grew up.
she filled out.
Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.
and here I was. expecting a skinny little bookworm.
maybe a bit too shy for her own good.
how little she told me about herself in all her letters for all those years.
how the hell did they find her?
then it hits me.
they were bluffing.
I've led them straight to her.
she hasn't spotted you yet.
turn around and walk out the door.
lead the creep outside.
get that Beretta away from him somehow. and kill him.
I'm just a horny ex-con watching an exotic dancer.
just a few seconds and she'll be safe.
no. Nancy. Don't notice me.
don't recognize me.
there's no time to expIain.
I've made a terribIe mistake, put you in terribIe danger.
we need to get out of here right this second.
whatever you say, Hartigan. Let me throw some cIothes on.
and here I'd figured you'd forgotten aII about me. Me and my dumb Ietters.
kept me going.
kept me from kiIIing myseIf.
hurry up, wiII you?
maybe I shouId drive. - Not a chance.
nobody but me can keep this heap running.
besides, from the sound of things, you might have to shoot somebody.
I don't have a gun. - Under the seat.
it's Ioaded and it works.
Yeah, this'II do.
taken it to the range a coupIe of times. Kicks Iike a muIe.
Hartigan, there's so much I've wanted to say to you.
you've never been far from my thoughts.
I've Iain awake nights, thinking of you.
what are you taIking about?
keep driving, Nancy. Keep driving and keep the car on the road!
she's counting on you. old man.
what are you doing?
prove you're still worth a damn.
try and keep it on the road, Nancy!
he's a decent shot.
he's got skill. but he's in too much of a hurry.
throwing away bullets like they were candy.
he doesn't know how to take his time.
aim careful and look the devil in the eye.
stop the car, Nancy. Gotta confirm the kiII.
what? - Stop the car, now!
right. Stop the car, confirm the kiII.
sorry. I got a IittIe rattIed.
it's OK. You did great. Sit tight. I'II be right back.
No! Let me stay cIose.
nothing can happen to me when I'm with you.
pIease? Let me stay cIose.
the stink - I almost gag.
his blood smells even worse than he does.
Jesus. - And it's all over the place.
but the creep himself. he's gone.
we're out of time.
the sirens - I used to welcome the sound.
there's nothing to do now but find a place to hole up for the night.
get Nancy calmed down. and figure out what on Earth I'm going to do next.
the stink - somehow it stays with us all the way to the motel.
Nancy, I went to your apartment.
your window was thrown wide open. The rooms Iooked aImost empty.
that's why I was sure you'd been kidnapped.
my window? Robbed again? That's the third time this year!
I swore if I ever saw you again, I'd show you I grew up strong.
but there I was, just Iike before, scared and heIpIess.
I'm such an asshoIe. - You shouId sit down.
you'II feeI a IittIe bit better if you sit down.
I've never been all that good with people.
when it comes to reassuring a traumatized 1 9-year-old.
I'm as expert as a palsy victim doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.
it's aIways been you, Hartigan.
aII these years.
it's just nerves making you say that, Nancy.
you're just exhausted. You need to sIeep.
sIeep with me. - Stop it, Nancy!
eight years.
why do you think I kept writing you those Ietters?
it wasn't just gratitude.
I tried to faII in Iove with boys.
even thought I did once or twice.
but I was aIready in Iove... with you.
no.
there's wrong and there's wrong and then there's this.
for God's sakes, you're just a kid!
I Iove you.
I Iove you, too.
with aII my heart.
cold shower - it helps.
no, Nancy.
recognize my voice, Hartigan?
recognize my voice, you piece of shit cop?
I Iook different, but I bet you can recognize my voice.
sure. I recognize your voice, Junior.
everything's gone straight to hell.
I've been suckered into betraying the only friend I've got.
and put her in the hands of a murdering rapist I thought I'd put down for good.
suckered by a spoiled brat son of a senator.
it's all gone to hell.
KIump, it's me.
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.
I want you to set me up for a party.
I've aIready got the girI, you dumb shit!
Hey, it better be perfect or I'm caIIing my dad!
my tooIs better be cIean and sharp.
it better be ready! It better be perfect!
I get to do whatever I want, however I want, whenever I want it!
my dad - I'd Iove him if I didn't hate him.
he spent a fortune hiring every expert on the pIanet to grow back that equipment you bIew off from between my Iegs, just so the oId fart can hoId out some kind of hope of having a grandkid.
AIthough, as you can see, there were some side effects.
I'm not compIaining, though. Since you've been gone,
I've been having the time of my Iife.
and now you've Ied me back to your darIing CordeIia.
we aII wondered who wrote aII those Ietters.
she Ieft not a cIue.
cIever girI. And so pretty, so pretty.
a IittIe oId for my taste, but I can forgive that just this once.
Nancy, don't scream.
whatever he does to you, don't scream.
she'II scream. I'm gonna take aII night doing dear oId Nancy.
and you're gonna die knowing that it's aII your fauIt.
they've aII screamed, Hartigan.
dozens of them - maybe a hundred.
eight years' worth. Every one of them has screamed.
and if there weren't so many peopIe hereabout,
I wouId show you how I'm gonna make dear oId Nancy scream.
it's gonna be one heII of a show!
this is it. No way to fight it now.
no hope left.
no chance.
this is it. This is the end.
no.
give it a shot. old man. Keep your neck tight. Move.
the window - maybe there's an alarm. The window.
keep your neck tight. goddamn it! Stay conscious!
stay conscious.
no alarm.
the glass! Cut the rope.
you can do it. You can do it.
it is incIement upon me to comment with marked dispIeasure on your rash impuIsiveness in seIecting such an eye-catching and impracticaI car to heist, Mr. ShIubb.
protest though you might, Mr. KIump, you must nonetheIess admit the phaIIic magistry of said Ferrari's performance.
an engine of CycIopean power throbs beneath this steeI staIIion's hood.
IrreIevant to said mission is the foIIowing query, which I now put forth to you.
wherein this most streamIined and trunkIess of transports
boner-inspiring though it may be
wherein are we to reposit our recentIy deceased cargo?
a worthy concern.
NeatIy eIucidated.
I can onIy express puzzIement that borders on aIarm.
teII me where Roark takes the girIs or I'II cut your damn head off!
in pIain EngIish, creep!
the answer you seek is ruraI, even agrarian.
the farm!
that's all I need to hear. Every cop on the force knows about the Roark family's farm and to stay away from it.
Shlubb and Klump were packing an arsenal.
once things get loud. I'll probably have use for the cannons.
but at first. I'll have to play it quiet.
quiet and nasty.
Nancy's car - six miles from the farm.
'nobody but me can keep this heap running. " she told me.
good girl. The car stalled out on that yellow bastard and you didn't tell him how to start it up again.
you kept your mouth shut. I'll bet Junior was furious.
I'll bet he slapped you around something fierce.
but you stayed strong. You bought a few extra minutes.
there's still a chance. Nancy.
don't scream.
I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm and make my way through the woods.
I'm not halfway there when it hits.
my heart. Can't be my heart.
I was cured.
bad cough - blood in it.
doesn't matter now.
I don't have to stay alive that much longer. anyway.
rotten way to kill a man. but it's quiet.
hate yourself later.
you're onIy making this worse for yourseIf, you stupid cow!
do you think I'm tired?
is that it? Do you think I'm getting tired?
you're the one who's gonna crack!
you'II crack!
you'II cry and beg!
you'II scream!
Oh, yeah, you'II scream, you big, fat, ugIy cow!
you'II scream!
you're thinking the whip was the worst I couId do?
that was forepIay.
Hartigan was right about you.
you can't get it up unIess I scream.
you're pathetic!
you're pathetic.
it's not wise at aII to make fun of me Iike that.
it brings out the worst in me.
stupid old man!
in too much of a hurry.
Damn! It can't be!
charging in like Galahad. just like I told myself I wouldn't!
stupid old man!
you tagged him good! - Don't take no chances. Perforate the fooI.
good advice.
give it up, Junior.
it's over. Let her go.
you're dreaming, Hartigan!
I get to see your eyes whiIe I fiIIet the woman of your dreams right in front of you!
look at you! You're about to keeI over!
you can't even Iift that cannon!
sure, I can.
you gave me a scare there for a second there, oId man.
Nancy, I'm sorry.
I'm taking no chances with you.
first I soften you up, and then it's showtime.
here it comes.
it's gonna hurt.
you're right about that.
sucker.
I take away his weapon.
both of them.
eight Iong years, son of a bitch!
after a while. all I'm doing is pounding wet chunks of bone into the floorboards.
so I stop.
so Iong, Junior.
been a pIeasure.
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.
I didn't scream.
I know it, baby.
you grew up strong.
by the time I get her to the car. Nancy stops shaking.
her skin is warm again. She's herself again.
thanks for remembering my coat.
and for aII the IittIe things.
like saving my Iife, twice.
you better get roIIing. - You're not coming aIong?
no. I have friends on their way, to coIIect evidence.
I'm gonna bIow this whoIe sick mess wide open.
I'm gonna cIear my name.
I'm gonna put Senator Roark behind bars where he beIongs.
I can't Iose you, not again.
you'II never Iose me, Nancy.
Nancy Callahan. the love of my life.
shame to lie to her. I hope she forgives me for it.
get Senator Roark behind bars? Sure.
and maybe after I've pulled off that miracle. I'll go and punch out God.
there isn't a prosecutor in the state who'll go after Senator Roark.
I killed his only son.
the bloodline is cut.
roark's lost his goddamn legacy.
he'll use all his power to get revenge on me.
he'll go after me through Nancy. He'll find her again.
there'll be no end to it.
she'll never be safe.
not as long as I'm alive.
there's only one way to beat him.
an old man dies.
a young woman lives.
fair trade.
I love you. Nancy.
none to speak of.
marital status?
Seriously?
you and Sara are getting along again. Maybe you eloped.
Vegas is a little outside my radius. Do you have to fill that out right now?
your commutation hearing is in a week. I put this off as long as I could.
would you say you have a girlfriend?
that's really on there?
Neal, the board is deciding whether to release you from your anklet from me permanently.
they want to know who's in your life.
are they a good influence, or are they gonna steer you back to the dark side?
and you think Sara could be an angel on my shoulder?
as opposed to that little devil you have on your shoulder now.
Mozzie's more of an imp than a devil.
but I was released into your custody.
ultimately, what you say at the hearing will carry the most weight.
okay.
target approaching.
he sure knows how to make friends.
he's one of the most beloved cons in the world.
and no criminal record.
he's a pro.
makes me wonder if that would be you
if you hadn't caught me? I'd like to think so.
if Gordon Taylor's in town, it means he's here to do a job.
he's a key suspect in some of the biggest heists in the past decade.
Antibes. That the location of his last job?
no, that's his villa.
they say you can hear his parties all the way across the Mediterranean.
that's not true. - Reminds me of college.
regardless, Taylor is a contract thief.
we need to find out who hired him and what they're planning to steal.
how is it Taylor doesn't have a record?
he has a saying - "Nobody gets caught. Everybody gets paid."
and so far, he's lived up to that.
he also has a very loyal following, and it helps that the public loves him.
even his victims say nice things.
check this out.
this was a heist he ran in Paris.
he dove out of a second-story window onto this guy's peugeot.
two weeks later, Taylor sends a check to the owner to cover the damages.
claimed he heard about the car on the news.
because he's popular, it's difficult to find witnesses willing to talk.
he's careful, and he's smart. This isn't gonna be easy.
we need to find out what he's hitting and when. He hires locally.
Neal, talk to the street, figure out what kind of crew he's putting together.
Diana, follow the money trail surrounding his trip.
Jones, cover surveillance on the hotel.
I want intel on everyone he meets.
you got it.
boss, you got a minute?
Yeah.
can I speak freely?
of course.
when agent Kramer was here last week, he told me he doesn't think Neal deserves to have his sentence commuted.
Kramer told you that?
he wanted to know what I planned to say when I testify at Neal's hearing.
he didn't say anything to me.
he knows you consider Neal a friend.
can I ask... - What am I gonna say at the hearing?
I haven't decided.
Kramer's sending some of his people to pick up Neal's old prison letters.
his letters to Kate?
we always suspected they contained codes, but we could never crack them.
maybe he thinks he can.
give Kramer what he wants.
if he asks me to go behind your back?
I can't imagine he would.
if he does?
if he does, do it.
but I want you to tell me about it.
I may be jeopardizing a wonderful career opportunity back in D.C.
I thought Christie hated D.C
she does. And I work for you.
without leaps of imagination, you lose the excitement of possibility.
are you quoting Gloria Steinem?
she's not just for feminists.
she has unlocked what's missing in our lives. We need jobs.
if she only knew who she inspired.
Oh, she does. But not any job.
a good job. A big job.
well, I have to be careful about taking those kind of jobs at the moment, okay?
look, I know this is risky with your big hearing coming up, but this is too good to pass up.
you are looking at the first man hired to be part of Gordon Taylor's next score.
no, no, no, Moz. The FBI is after Taylor.
Peter and I are chasing down his crew.
me! You're looking for me. I'm his crew.
pull out. You're gonna get caught.
Taylor never gets caught, and everybody gets paid!
have you already said yes?
Yeah, of course I did. No one says no to Taylor.
and he asked me about you to be his possible point man.
he asked about me?
point. Man.
all right, there's a way we can still do this, but you're gonna have to work with us.
"us" - You mean the suits?
Yeah.
you're already in. Taylor's going down one way or another.
Yeah, I don't want to be the one to bring him down.
look, if we do this right, no more anklet, no more prison. I'll be free, Moz.
look, Neal, I - I want to help you.
really, I do, but not in this way.
come on. The guy's a legend.
all right, how about this? You keep your integrity intact.
you said Taylor was asking about me, so set up the meeting.
then you've done your part.
if he takes you on, I will not wear a wire, I will not testify, and I will not lie to Taylor.
you won't have to. It'll be like we're really doing the job.
Yeah, without the fun.
or the threat of prison.
like I said.
this case takes us home, Moz.
home. That's an apropos analogy, considering the target.
Why? What's the target?
Taylor's gonna hit Yankee Stadium?
it's a good job.
got to hand it to you.
took you all of 24 hours to find out Taylor's target.
well, not only that, but as an added bonus, I've figured out a way to work Mozzie into his crew.
Really? Are you in his crew?
not yet. But I'm thinking that's the way to go on this one. Me and Moz on the inside.
any idea what Taylor's going after in there?
Nope.
I don't know what you're planning, but you are one week away from freedom, and you are really playing with fire here.
you're welcome.
let's go to the ballpark.
you're in a good mood.
my dad took me to a day game when I was 8.
decided then and there I wanted to play for the Yankees.
Yeah, you and every other 8 year-old at the game.
Yeah. I did end up getting pretty good.
I'm sure you did.
I imagine a shelf somewhere loaded with little-league trophies.
Yankee Stadium.
new house that Ruth built.
new cathedral of baseball.
the new Bronx Zoo.
you must be Geoffrey, head of security. Special agent Peter Burke.
well, thanks for the heads up. Looked over the file you sent.
he's never used a weapon or a threat of violence?
no, but we can't relax.
we know Taylor intends to strike somewhere in the stadium.
we're trying to identify the likely times and targets.
well, the vaults below are secure, but we handle millions in cash from concessions every game.
you should vary the pick-up and drop-off times.
and of course, the public has easy access to the museum.
I think we should see that for ourselves.
all right.
this is awesome. -Okay.
you know, we can't even place a value on most of these pieces of history.
they're each one-of-a-kind.
is all your memorabilia in this room?
well, most of it's concentrated in here, but we also have championship trophies and retired jerseys throughout the building.
got to be millions of square feet to cover.
we should get blueprints.
slugger.
right. Uh, could we trouble you for building plans and a chart of the display cases and security cameras?
sure. Why don't you wait here while I pull it all together?
I, uh - I get the feeling you'd like to look around a little more.
Thanks, Geoffrey. - Sure.
go ahead.
being here, all this... reminds me of watching games with my dad.
your dad take you to a lot of games?
no. Mostly we'd watch them on TV.
he'd run an extension cord out to the porch, put on our yankee caps, crack open a beer.
way to go, dad.
well, root beer for me.
during commercials, we'd throw the ball around.
sounds like something to go home for.
it is. And when I go back, we still do it.
except now I drink real beer.
Oh, man. What I'd pay to have that bat in my collection.
I bet it's a lot of money for that piece of wood.
"piece of wood"?
Yeah. I mean, take away the fact that Dimaggio swung it, it's just a bat.
but some guy named Pollock can splatter paint on a canvas and you think it's worth millions of dollars.
"Splatter paint on a canvas"?
you stand in front of one of Pollock's works, the chaos fades away and you see the discipline, the balance of restraint and abandon.
like when Dimaggio stepped up to the plate.
great art has a broader meaning. It captures a time, a place, an emotion.
this bat was used to set the all-time hit-streak record the same year hirohito bombed Pearl Harbor.
for four, five at-bats a day, Dimaggio let Americans forget that we were going to war.
a time, a place, an emotion.
this bat, those balls, these pennants got this country through some tough times.
they still do.
gives us something to root for.
and if you work hard, swing for the fences...
...anything's possible.
that's how you feel about baseball?
that's how a lot of people feel about baseball.
Yankees security is sending over more surveillance footage.
great. Where's Caffrey?
prepping for his audition for Taylor's crew.
a bit like putting a drink in the hands of an alcoholic.
reformed alcoholic, I know. And it's more like a bottle.
but putting Caffrey side by side with someone like Taylor is the best way to nail him.
here's some surveillance from the hotel.
Yes, I know. It's Mozzie. He's Neal's in.
how convenient.
so long as he stays on our side, we don't ask questions.
we've granted Mozzie immunity.
to preserve his street cred, you want us to arrest him if we catch him?
and make it look real.
Oh, I will. - Same for Caffrey.
Taylor knows a lot about Neal, but our backstop has held up.
that he was released two years ago but remains a person of interest in a number of elegant high-profile crimes.
any other questions?
good. Let's make the Yankees proud.
billiards. Couldn't be a better audition.
don't get cocky. The man is unparalled.
he has won the Taylor world championship so many times they named the tournament after him.
are you jealous?
I'm ecstatic for him.
it gives me hope knowing that Taylor and his villa on the French Riviera even exist.
of course I want to be him.
I assume his game is eight ball.
Oh, it is. Winning is important, but more so, he says he can learn everything he needs to know about you by how you play pool.
how competitive you are, what risks you take, your level of confidence...
did you get any more info on what he's after?
Taylor is true to his rep. He promises no details until the game is afoot.
it's a good way to keep a crew honest.
Yeah. We could learn a lot from him.
Oh, and when you meet him, he's gonna give you a big bear hug.
it seems like he's just being effusive, because he is.
but what he's really doing is - Giving me the pat-down.
exactly. - Got it.
Oh, that must be your cue.
to do what?
no, I mean your new cue.
hello. - Hi, June.
now, while I still have serious reservations about your participation,
I felt compelled to give you the best shot at success.
gentlemen, may I present Lord Byron.
june, I love you.
I mean, Byron must have run the tables with this.
you know, for some reason, every great con man in the world needs to master the game of pool at some point in his life.
I was 9 years old.
there was a pool hall on my way home from school.
a pool hall in St. Louis, Missouri. Must have been full of hustlers.
Yeah. I was one of them.
thank you.
Hi, Peter . - Hi, Sara.
what's going on, aside from that mustard stain about to happen?
thank you. Can I get you anything?
no. - Here you go.
no, that's all right.
the board is putting together a list of character witnesses for Neal's commutation hearing.
I'm sorry his what?
he didn't mention that to you?
no.
commutation hearing? So Neal might be set free?
it's possible.
and why would they do that?
after Keller's arrest, the board of corrections recommended an early release for Neal.
well, good for him. - Yeah.
only Caffrey, huh?
well, could be. It's far from settled.
how do you think it's gonna go?
the board knows that you testified against Neal at his trial.
yes I was very upset about that Raphael back then.
but somehow, you were able to get past that far enough to start dating him.
so if I testify, my relationship with Neal is likely to come up as public record?
it might get a little uncomfortable.
no, no, no. It's not the relationship, Peter .
it's why we broke up that poses the problem.
I'm gonna assume pleading the fifth is not ideal at these hearings.
no. No, it's not.
honestly, I don't know where Neal and I stand right now.
you might want to think about it.
here comes your 2: 00.
Hi. Neal Caffrey.
welcome.
so, uh, you're a pool player.
Yeah, I like to play.
of course, I don't know if I'm in your league.
well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there?
let me just finish up.
you're up.
so, Neal, tell me about yourself.
when did you get out?
18 months and 17 days ago, not that I've been counting.
I've never been to the big house, myself.
it does not look like fun.
it certainly forced me to be more cautious.
I can tell.
you haven't given me very many choices.
c'est la vie.
so, what do you think, Neal?
let the boss win so you can get the job?
absolutely not.
correct. I prefer honesty over ass-kissing.
thought you might appreciate the challenge.
of course, I don't mind the occasional puckering up.
excellent effort.
except you've left yourself with no shot.
eight ball, corner pocket.
what if I can make that shot?
I don't think you can.
if I make that shot right now, will you hire me on the spot?
listen, Neal, you play aggressively, but with grace.
you think ahead, and if half of what I've heard about the u-boat treasure is true, then I definitely want you on my team.
but you're over-reaching, and that is a very bad sign.
I can make the shot.
you make it, you're in. You miss, you walk out the door.
all right.
welcome aboard.
same place tomorrow morning, we'll go over the plan.
I'll be there.
it's open.
Hi, Neal.
Sara. Hi.
this is a surprise.
Yeah, today is that kind of day.
Oh, you need my help on another case?
no. Peter told me about your commutation hearing.
Oh, yeah. That.
Yeah, that. Congratulations.
thank you.
how long have you known about it?
a while. - Yeah?
you didn't say anything about it when we... reconnected.
Yeah.
look, I didn't bring it up because I didn't want to ask you to appear at the hearing.
you didn't trust what I would say?
no. We worked together, and it went really well.
Yeah, I thought so.
I didn't want you to think it was because I needed you to say nice things about me.
well, I appreciate that.
don't do it again.
what?
Neal, what are we doing right now?
talking? - Yes, we're talking.
we're being open with each other. That is what we need to do.
I don't need you to protect me by hiding things from me, all right?
cause that's where we got tripped up last time.
that, and a multi-billion-dollar uboat treasure, you know, explosion.
all right. Tonight, you and I are gonna talk.
not about your hearing, but we are gonna talk.
what do we talk about?
everything.
quid pro quo.
I am an open book.
Really?
I think I know where to start.
of course you do.
how many other former fiances do you have?
okay.
and do they all practice tal chi?
stop it. It was just the one.
Really? - It was the one.
are you sure?
is your real name Neal?
that is a very long story.
it sounds like a really good story.
it's really boring, and I'd prefer it, frankly, if you started with something a little more innocuous.
gonna have to work into it? - Yeah.
Hi! - Good morning.
Peter will be down in just a second. Come on in.
you, uh, want some breakfast?
I would love some.
good. - Thank you.
this place looks great, by the way.
Thanks!
you're, uh, awfully chipper this morning.
so are you.
el, you are a tigress! A tigress!
honey! - Oh, I know when you
Hey, Neal. You grab some breakfast?
I'm not hungry anymore.
you're early.
I'm excited to get started on this case.
excited to work with Taylor?
excited to bring Taylor to justice.
have you ever heard of Robert Withrow, jr.
wealthy, entitled son of Robert Withrow, jr.and owner of the Withrow Hotel?
the one and only Diana followed Taylor's money trail back to him.
that would explain why he's staying at the Withrow Hotel.
well, his passion for baseball raised some eyebrows.
he collects priceless baseball memorabilia.
the Yankees say he's tried to buy some of their most significant pieces over the years.
but they're not willing to sell. Enter Taylor.
exactly. That's Geoffrey, from the Yankees.
why don't you finish your breakfast, then we'll wire you.
Geoffrey, good news.
I never realized how much Peter loves baseball.
well, you know, the Twins drafted him.
wait, he played pro?
he had an amazing slider.
played in the minors right after college.
and two weeks into spring training, I blew out my rotator cuff.
honey, I'm sorry. I thought Neal knew.
it's okay.
I'm gonna finish getting ready. You guys, have a good day.
all right. - Love you.
see you.
so, that's it, huh? You only got to play for two weeks?
I went under the knife, and they were able to repair it.
three months later, I was back in the rotation with the triple-A club.
so you still had the slider?
Yeah, but that was the problem.
I could throw it, but the doctors said if I continued, I'd destroy my arm for good.
that was in my head every time I pitched.
so I left.
I had a choice - I could continue down that path or find a new passion.
it's a tough call to make.
you never look back and wish you played in the majors?
Oh, of course I do.
there's no bigger dream than playing in the show.
standing on that mound, right in the middle of the stadium, listening to the crowd chant your name.
in hindsight, if I'd kept playing, I would have destroyed my arm.
then I never would have been able to pass the FBI physical.
and I never would have caught you.
come on. Time for our show.
Caffrey's anklet's off, he's wired, and inside the billiard room.
Jones, when you played ball, did you ever imagine having walk-out music?
you know, walk-out music, to get the crowd going when you walk out to the mound.
Yeah, I know what it is. I never set my sights that high.
I take it you did.
"I go to work," except it'd be "I go to Burke."
Kool Moe Dee? Really?
Yeah. Yeah. I was a closer."I go to Burke."
that's definitely old-school.
it works. - Yeah, it works.
they're in.
as I of yours.
that thing at the Del Monico a few months back...
was that just Neal, or was it the both of you?
he's not one to brag.
I respect that.
it was me, not him.
looks like our cover story's working.
they think Caffrey was involved with the Del Monico diamond heist.
you know, Kramer actually asked me about it.
he ask you anything about Neal's old prison letters?
Diana said he's sending a team in to scour them for codes.
no, just about Neal's old crimes.
by the end of the conversation, he had me thinking twice over whether we'd be doing the bureau and Caffrey any favors by letting him out early.
Mozzie, they were out of the Gosset Brut, so I had them open a Grand Cuvee '96.
96 Grand Cuvee. My usual.
Neal, I know how much you love the Caspian osetra caviar so they're bringing up an ounce.
much appreciated.
you think this is what his life will be like?
who? Neal?
when his anklet's off.
there is that chance we'll be hearing this same conversation.
Yeah, only then it'll be a lot harder to monitor him.
Yeah. Robert. Let's talk outside.
no, that's nonsense. I wanted to see what my money's bought me.
gentlemen. What's going on?
this is a friend of mine.
I'm your boss. Who are you?
what's going on over there?
this is a jammer.
without it, we only talk about the weather.
every frequency's killed.
we almost had withrow and Taylor on tape.
instead we're out here with nothing.
okay. Here's the deal.
the only thing I know about you guys is that you're a bunch of professional thieves, so I'm sure you won't take it personally when I say that I don't trust any one of you.
but you hired me.
it's my job to deliver on our agreement.
Yeah. And I know that you will, because Paul here's gonna make sure by going with you.
this isn't working for me.
guns get you caught, hurt, 10 to life.
no guns. No outsiders.
it's non-negotiable.
then this is where we part company. No hard feelings.
gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.
I'll be in touch shortly to pay you for your time.
I hope we can work together again soon.
hold on. Hold on. You can't just walk out of here. They know who I am.
that's because you waltzed in here and introduced yourself to everybody.
nobody's leaving.
Robert, please.
if the feds can't hear us, this may turn into the last 10 minutes of a Tarantino film.
if they could hear us, they'd be here already.
Yeah, and we die in a slow-motion hail of bullets while Nancy Sinatra plays ironically in the background.
all right, don't zip up your boots yet, Nancy.
excuse me, gentlemen.
it's all right, Neal. I've got it under control.
understood, but I just had a thought.
it seems to me if Mr. Withrow trusts Paul, then we should trust him, too.
use him as our breaker, so long as he doesn't change the plan.
and Taylor has a good reason for the no-guns rule.
stadium security does not mess around.
we'd need weeks of additional preparation, and even then, it's not worth the risk.
paul joins us, but we leave the weapons here. That's just my two cents.
are you willing to put Paul on your crew?
I've got men on every exit. What now?
keep monitoring from here in case they come back online.
I'm gonna check in with Yankees security to get an op order for today's game.
I have a feeling this is going down soon.
we'll let you know the moment they move.
great.
Yankee stadium. The museum.
what's our target?
george Herman Ruth's first official home run ball, hit against the Yankees on may 6, 1915, at the polo grounds.
it's priceless, not for sale.
Mozzie, you're first up. How'd the hunt go?
Oh, good. This ball is from 1921.
excellent. Your job will be to detail this to perfection.
Neal, how's the Babe Ruth signature?
he couldn't tell us apart.
that's what I like to hear. When Mozzie's finished, you sign the ball.
then at the stadium, you make the switch.
they're gonna catch on it's a forgery.
Yeah, Neal's right - I can make this passable, but an expert will nix this on closer observation. Exactly.
we want them to know that it's stolen, just after we're gone.
duran, you're gonna play lookout while Smitty sets up the video feed.
paul - Trustworthy Paul - You now have the most important job.
you'll pretend to admire the Babe Ruth ball...
smash the glass...
...and run away, leaving the ball there.
security will pursue.
that would be me.
and Neal will switch out the real ball for the fake ball.
and meet me in the upper-deck hallway in a camera-blind spot to make the pass.
and then you'll give me the ball at parking k-5.
exactly. Neal... Nice watch.
thank you.
take it off.
you're a security guard. They don't wear $5, 000 watches.
in fact, all of you, cellphones, watches, communication devices in the bucket.
from now on, no outside contact.
thanks for the update, Diana.
Kramer's people are here. I wasn't invited in.
you let me know if you hear anything.
Peter , I've got the op order. They've approved two additional teams.
all right. Great. If we don't hear from Caffrey in two hours, we move in.
Yes, sir.
is this a bad time?
what's up?
I've made a decision.
the burnt amber is calibrated ever so slightly warm.
Oh, here. Practice.
I need to get a message to Peter .
he's inspiring, Neal.
he's skilled, strategic, magnanimous...
commutation, Moz.
I thought a lot about what you said, and I want to testify on his behalf.
okay. The cost of freedom.
what do you want the note to say?
I'll hide it under the stitching.
we talked. A lot.
and... While he is never going to be a model citizen, he's also not the brazen thief that he was six years ago when I went after him for that Raphael.
excuse me. - Yeah.
Yeah, Jones. What's up?
tail them and stay low. I'm on my way.
what's going on?
Neal's about to rob Yankee Stadium.
gather 'round, gentlemen. It's game time.
I want to see this ball that I'm paying for.
I don't want any of you walking out with the real one when I'm stuck with the fake.
let's see.
of course.
fingerprints. Come right over there.
if they find Peter 's note, then cue up Nancy Sinatra.
it's good.
wait, what's this?
the two red stitches in a row.
uh, t-that's for your benefit.
it'll fool most of the experts, and of course it's not on the real ball.
so you'll be able to tell the difference.
nice work, Mozzie.
I knew you were the man for the job.
all right, gentlemen. Let's go.
Hi, Peter . game on.
Diana, I'm at the stadium. What's our status?
we got this place covered.
any sign of Taylor and his crew?
they're here, used the V.I.P. entrance.
Taylor and Mozzie are holed up in the delta suite.
is Withrow with them?
negative. We believe he's still at the hotel.
what about Neal and the others?
they spread out in the crowd.
geoffrey's got extra men at every hot point we identified, so as soon as they surface, we got 'em.
all right. I'll meet you in five.
right on schedule.
they may be on to us.
looks like there's additional security.
guess we'll have to give them someone to catch.
batter up.
Hey! Stop right there! Get him!
I confess. I confess.
we've got a vandal in the museum. Secure the room.
no, no. I got it. You guys can take him in.
all right, everybody. Clear out of here, please. Okay? Can you back up?
thank you.
looks like he broke clean through the glass.
get everybody out of here.
runners on the corners.
like clockwork.
I have to tell you, Mr. Taylor, this is a first-class operation from top to bottom.
well, you and Neal are a pleasure to work with.
you're not having nearly enough fun, Mozzie.
I cloak anxiety with indifference and reserved chatter.
you know, I might have some work coming up later in the summer.
how do you feel about Paris?
J'adore Paris, mon frere.
good. Good.
you're up.
I don't know anything about any heist!
last chance. You sure?
I accidentally bumped into the case.
get him out of here.
well, he's got to be the decoy.
this just doesn't add up. I mean, why didn't he take the ball?
because he left it for someone else to take.
I want to see the ball that's in that case now.
all right.
I'm on deck. - Okay. Good luck.
Thanks. See you around.
agent Berrigan, someone's approaching the suite.
description?
5'10," brown hair, slender build, wearing a jacket and cap.
moving in now.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
false alarm.
they just don't have the bats to put runs on the board.
come on, Peter .
what do you make of that?
the pattern on the stitching's off.
Yep. It's supposed to consistently alternate red, blue, red, blue.
this patch here, it's red and red.
is that a common mistake?
no. But I'll have to check this ball's documentation.
you know, it's nearly 100 years old.
that'll take too long.
what are you doing?
bear with me.
wait!
I can't believe you did that.
thank you, Neal.
we don't have much time. Come on.
Caffrey took a real chance writing a message in that ball.
Neal may be the expert in spotting forged paintings and bearer bonds - And gems. - Antiquities, counterfeit money.
pretty much any kind of document.
anyway, baseball's my thing.
there's Withrow.
there it is. Go. Go.
FBI! Hands in the air!
I was just scalping tickets.
Taylor, turn around slowly.
I'll take that.
Hey, now. Careful with that thing, man. It's priceless.
Yeah, it's gonna cost you four to six years.
I have a well-maintained reputation as a crook.
make my arrest look real.
say "ow." - ow!
Where's Taylor?
he called an audible and sent us instead.
did Neal tip him off?
now, that's an ungrateful thank-you from the cynical eyes of the law.
have you ever considered there are some criminals who are too smart to get caught?
no.
pig!
what are you doing, Moz?
pantomiming his wholly unexpected capture, I'm sure.
it's not just the New York summer heat. The air thickens when things don't feel right.
Mozzie said something, didn't he?
everyone gets paid.
always on my team.
I hope this little operation of yours has built up enough good will that you'll be joining Mozzie in Paris in a few months.
you still think I'm a thief?
fish don't do well out of water.
agent Berrigan, I think you should take a look at this.
Neal coded his letters.
and we cracked it.
don't know what they mean yet, but we will.
they cracked Neal's letter code to Kate.
this isn't good.
coming.
thought we were meeting at the office.
can I come in? - Sure. Come on in.
you okay? You seem a little tense.
Yeah, just got some things on my mind... One of which is Taylor.
how do you think he got away?
he runs a pretty good game.
he does. You want to know what I think?
sure.
he's not the most brilliant criminal, and his thefts aren't high-tech.
but he knows people.
I think he charmed Mozzie, the same way he does everybody else, and in the end, Mozzie liked him too much to see him get caught.
that's one theory.
but you got Withrow.
and you saved the baseball.
which reminds me, I got something for you.
you sure you're okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
get ready.
what?
that's my rookie card. - Sure is.
you know, I got to say, knowing you played pro ball,
I don't know, made me see you in a whole new light.
Really? - Yeah.
there's a lot more to Peter Burke than I know.
how did you get this?
I have my ways.
I got something else for you, too, for saving a piece of baseball history.
come on. You're gonna love it.
can I keep this? - Sure.
not that expensive.
how did you arrange this?
I have my ways.
you ready? - yep.
let's go to burke.
I'm standing on the pitcher's mound... in Yankee Stadium.
I know.
thank you.
why didn't you tell me you played pro?
there are things in the past that live in the past.
not my life anymore.
some of the things we've done are pretty hard to forget.
honestly, Peter ...
...do I have a shot at commutation?
you know, the one thing that I took away from my injury is that, on days like this, don't worry about the future or the past.
enjoy the moment?
Yeah.
got some sauce on it!
y, I just need to get couple of things out of there.
can I just...
I just need, like, two things.
they're right there.
I can see them they're right there.
I don't understand why I can't go over.
okay. I got it.
okay?
make sure you get a shot of the body over there.
what took everybody so long?!
911 received a call around 9: 00 P.M.
that some guy was getting strangled to death in the Toyota section of the parking lot here.
now, you guys pop in about 30 minutes after I find the victim's car!
excuse me, sir, where is the chief?
uh, she's right over there.
I'd recognize those legs anywhere.
Hey, she's not feeling well!
chief? Are you okay?
no.
I'm hot, and I have a fever, and the cold medicine I took is making me dizzy and nauseated, and y'all are incredibly late.
this is off of our victim, who was garroted from behind.
lieutenant Provenza has the murder weapon.
31.0
north Hollywood address.
business card say she's a personal trainer.
there's over $50 in here.
okay, so it's not robbery.
so why are we here?
Robbery/Homicide received five new cases this weekend, so commander Taylor asked us to help him out.
now, if y'all could get started on something and allow me to talk to sergeant Gabriel alone for a moment, please?
so, you're mad at me, is that it?
no.
I'm -- I'm confused.
I called you and nobody answered.
do you see what I'm wearing here?
or did you not read the schedule I gave you this morning?
Where'd you put it?
in your hand.
well, what was it? What'd it say?
it said that we were completing weapons of mass destruction training tonight, that our division deadline is Friday the 26th, two days from now.
so that's all finished, then?
no. No, we're not finished.
we were 17 minutes short of finishing when you apparently demanded that we be sent to you.
now the whole squad has to start the training over again from the beginning.
why is this even necessary?
because the federal government gives us a subsidy for each person that completes the training.
so it's Pope's budget stuff?
Yes, it is.
shouldn't you be in bed?
no.
I should be having a word with the valet.
I-I didn't see anything.
I'm in and out of cars all night, and I was -
I was in one when I pulled around, and the officer, he -
he told me that some guy got killed over there, and that, well, no cars could go out, and that's not good.
I mean, look -- look at how many angry customers.
my uncle, he's gonna be really upset.
your uncle?
Yeah. He owns the lot.
I need to either bring people their cars or give them their keys back.
what is he doing?
is that how it's done here?
you park people's cars, and then bring them back or give them their keys?
according to the placement of the vehicle.
What?! That -- that's mine.
the victim's keys were by his body.
he was walking to his car when someone put a razor wire around his neck and sawed through his jugular.
and you saw nothing?
no, no.
I'm sorry.
I must have been looking the other way or something.
Dr. Morales, I am so sorry I'm late.
I wasn't feeling well.
Oh, hi, Terrence.
sorry to hear you're sick.
you want me to check you out?
sorry. That didn't sound right.
actually, doctor, I am feeling a little weird, a-and the cold medicine I took seems to be makin' my heart race. Is that normal?
okay, first, stay over there, 'cause whatever you have, I don't want it.
sorry.
you want to know my symptoms?
do you have insurance?
Yes, I do.
then see your own doctor.
if you end up dying, I promise to find out why.
may I see you for a moment, please?
well, I'm just about to head into an examination.
let me rephrase that rhetorical question.
I want to speak with you...now.
sergeant Gabriel just informed me you pulled your squad out of WMD training.
that's right, because murder takes precedent over people walking around in hazmat suits.
we seriously need the money the FEDs give us for bringing your squad into WMD compliance.
and I seriously need to find someone who garrotes people in parking lots.
which is more important?
besides, you and I both know that my team isn't going anywhere where those stupid hazmat suits are necessary.
priority homicide must be brought up to WMD qualification.
there is no way around that, so I've rescheduled the training for tomorrow.
tomorrow? - Yeah.
what if I don't solve the murder by then?
no. No way.
or you can lose one member of your squad permanently to counter terrorism.
why do you keep threatening me with that?
and when I'm sick, too.
she's a little spit fire, isn't she?
the garrote killed him, but these marks on his back look to be from a taser.
someone zapped your vic to take the fight out of him.
not a bad plan.
buff guy here.
also, Mr. Cooper had dinner less than an hour before he was killed, maybe a tan Italian restaurant.
looks like pumpkin ravioli.
I don't often find it this time of year.
some risotto, lots of bread.
you sure this guy was a fitness instructor?
that's an awful lot of carbs.
also looks like he had at least a half a bottle of red wine and a dozen raw oysters.
sounds romantic, doesn't it?
Cooper's credit cards are maxed out, so he didn't charge anything the night he was killed.
but here's something interesting.
up until last week, he made daily withdrawals of $500 -
the maximum allowed with his ATM card.
according to my math, that's almost $20, 000 in cash.
why would he need that much money?
blackmail.
expensive drug habit.
any information on our 911 call?
a recording's on the way.
the owner of the phone, who denies making the call, says that he was at a nearby restaurant having dinner at the time of the murder.
three Italian restaurants in the vicinity of where Mr. Muscles was found.
two serve raw oysters, but only one, Il Primo, had pumpkin ravioli on the menu last night - a special.
and a waiter recognized our victim from his DMV photo.
said he had a hot blonde with him, and the babe paid.
please, please hold your applause.
a copy of the hot blonde's credit-card receipt.
thank you, thank you very much.
and the name on the credit card?
Tiffany Lewis? - Yes?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, L.A. P.D.
and this is sergeant David Gabriel.
Oh, payback from when I sent Susan the fireman stripper. Is that it?
actually, Mrs. Lewis, we're here to talk to you about Glen Cooper.
did you tell Maria to put the vodka in the freezer?
excuse me.
what is it, honey?
did you tell Maria to put the vodka in the freezer?
I did, Bob.
aren't I a good girl?
who are they?
Um...Mormons.
remember, we're going out to dinner tonight.
I know. Very exciting.
so, I take it that the oysters and red wine that you had at Il Primo were not with your husband?
I can't talk about this right now.
can you maybe just go away?
sure.
as long as you promise to come downtown to my office in, say, two hours.
we can continue this in a more private setting.
I'm kind of busy right now.
or I can come back. It's your choice.
Oh. What am I supposed to tell my husband about where I'm going?
whatever you usually tell him, Mrs. Lewis.
what now, Mr. Howard?
I'm sorry to bother you again.
I need another E.T.A. on when you think the doctor might be ready to see Ms. Johnson.
Any...moment.
just a little more patience, please, okay?
really soon.
we have been waiting 45 minutes.
that's why they call it a waiting room.
deputy chief Johnson.
Yes, sergeant.
Oh. All right.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.
Brenda, wait.
Hey, hey.
you're sick.
I'm feelin' fine now, and I only have 24 hours to finish this case before my squad has to play war games, and, honestly, it is just a little cold.
you don't have a runny nose. You don't have a cough.
the cold medicine keeps that from happening.
look, just don't worry.
if I get another fever, we'll -- we'll see.
I'll see you at home.
sir.
sir, you can't go back there!
uh, chief, Tiffany Lewis' credit-card statements.
I faxed Glen Cooper's picture to the other restaurants where they ate, and last night's meal wasn't their first dinner for two.
Plus, there are several five-star hotel charges, all here in town.
well, thank you.
all right, then, Mrs. Lewis.
okay, I admit it.
you admit to what, exactly?
I'm having an affair with Glen.
I know I shouldn't be, but I didn't know that it was illegal in California.
honestly, I think that I'm being picked on for some reason.
Oh, Mrs. Lewis, it isn't against the law to, uh, have an affair.
Really?
really.
Oh, my god, you don't know how you guys just scared me.
I almost peed a little.
you're not gonna tell my husband, are you?
I mean, he has a temper, and I didn't mean to start having an affair.
it just happened.
and then it kept happening.
I think it's because guys just want to have sex with me, damn it.
as long as you completely cooperate, I see no reason to inform your husband.
thank god.
our prenup's really bad for me.
when you and Mr. Cooper were leaving the restaurant last night, did you notice anything suspicious?
Oh, I wouldn't know.
let me think.
we left the restaurant, he walked me to my car, he kissed me good night, and I went home.
seems normal.
you didn't valet your car?
last time I valeted my car, the attendant guy stole my pot, so I don't valet anymore.
are you sure your husband didn't know about your affair?
Oh, no.
if he knew that Glen and I were screwin' around, Bob would be just furious.
why are you so interested in all of this?
well, I'm sorry to tell you this, Tiffany, but, um, last night, Glen Cooper was murdered in a parking lot outside the restaurant where -
murdered?
you mean like somebody killed him?
Yes.
I'm so sorry.
no, there --there must be a mistake.
that's wrong!
we're very sorry, Mrs. Lewis.
Oh. Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, no!
Oh, my god!
Oh, no.
chief, we got confirmation that, during the murder, when the 911 call was made, the owner of this cell phone was sitting at the chef's table of Chez Bohemia.
he claims his cell phone was in his car -
the same lot where the body was found.
only one other person had access to that phone during the time of the murder.
our valet parker, Kenny Woods.
I just dumped him in the interview room with Provenza.
so, what'd I miss?
hot, married girlfriend of the victim named Tiffany.
I think she wanted me.
thank you, detective Sanchez, for keeping us up to date.
perhaps you can find out where Tiffany's husband was last night and what he was doing during the time of the murder?
more about Mr. Woods, please.
okay, I spoke to Mr. Lang, the owner of the parking lot where Kenny works, and when I asked him about the Toyota section, which is where the 911 caller said someone was being murdered, Mr. Lang laughed.
he said the only one who has a Toyota section is his nephew Kenny.
he also says that Kenny has obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is a fancy way of saying he's a control freak.
now, he takes some medication for it.
I could find out the name if you'd like.
no, thanks, Lieutenant.
does Mr. Woods have a previous relationship with the L.A.P.D?
seems our valet doesn't like it when people pull out of his parking lot the wrong way, whatever the hell that means.
l. A.P. D. picked him up for two little dust-ups with some customers.
and our little weirdo is sticking to his story.
well, then, I'll have to make his stay here very welcoming, then, won't I?
thank you, Lieutenant.
911, what is your emergency?
I just saw some-body strangle somebody in the -- the Toyota section of the parking lot.
and what is your location, sir?
Lang's valet, e-east of Grand.
emergency vehicles are on.
there are more than a few similarities between this caller and you, Kenny.
he reports a man being murdered in the Toyota section of your parking lot, and you made the call on this cellphone, which happened to be locked in one of the cars you valeted.
I - I - I didn't - I didn't make any call.
the caller also stammers.
I...
I didn't make any call.
these are the fingerprints that were found on the cell phone hat made the 911 call.
and these are your fingerprints.
they match.
maybe the phone was on the seat and I moved it.
Ah, you've got a bit of a temper, don't you, Kenny boy?
rap sheet says here that you've been picked up twice for some pretty nasty arguments with customers.
I do not have a-a-a temper!
it's just there's a certain way that cars need to be put in and brought out, and other people, they don't always understand the challenges of valet parking!
did the man who had his throat cut in your lot last night not understand those challenges?
did you two argue?
what? No!
seriously, why -- why would you think such things about me?
because you're not tellin' me the truth, Kenny!
and I have to consider why, and one possibility is that you killed Mr. Cooper because he interfered with the way you ran the lot.
I made the call, okay?
but I didn't --I didn't kill him!
I'm not saying anything else until after I floss.
I-I can't --I can't say anything else.
I need to -- I need to brush my teeth and floss.
why can't you say anything else?
you made the call.
you saw Glen Cooper die.
did you see the killer, too?
were you threatened in some way? - No.
Mr. Cooper was attacked, so you grabbed a set of keys and you locked yourself in a car.
and the killer threatened you as you drove away.
is that it?
can you identify him?
no.
no, no, no.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
can I just --just park cars?
the answer to that, kenny, is yes. - Okay.
I can't compel you to tell me anything.
just remember one thing -
killers don't like leaving eye witnesses around, especially ones who've been talking to the police.
so you be careful in your parking lot tonight.
wait.
don't you have to protect me?
from who? - From that guy!
so we're looking for a man?
what did he look like, Kenny?
how big was he? How old?
no, no, no, no, no.
no.
he will kill me if I talk.
Oh, my god.
Oh! Oh. Look, um...
I think -- I think I'd rather just stay here tonight.
please.
I'll see if I can pull some strings.
Oh. Oh, my god.
thank you.
I know I should've rescheduled with the doctor, but I think I figured out what's going on here.
palpitations, fever, feeling faint.
you have a diagnosis that covers all that?
cold medicine plus stress.
okay.
lowering your pressure at work couldn't hurt, but you still have to see a doctor because I don't think stress causes fevers.
that's from the cold, which is on its way out.
I can tell.
so...
let's talk about the anxiety.
you deal with murders all the time, and it doesn't usually get you this stressed out, so...what's up?
budget issues.
Pope's makin'...
he's makin' my squad go through weapons of mass destruction training for some federal subsidies.
eight hours in those ridiculous hazmat suits.
startin' tomorrow, they're all gonna be runnin' around some potential terrorist target, leavin' me to solve this murder completely on my own...
with Provenza, who I guess is too old for WMD.
it's just -- you see how upsettin' that is?
do you see it?
right.
okay.
you know, I think I know a way you can work the murder and keep your whole team all in the same place.
the floor of this building is not a proper place for WMD training.
Oh, well, according to your qualification manual, which is what I'm going by, "any emergency training to be completed by said group may be conducted in any and all government-owned and operated venues, " not excluding those which might themselves be targets in a terrorist attack.
that sounds like Parker Center to me.
you're deliberately misinterpreting the text.
just so you know, for the next 7 hours and 38 minutes, this squad is mine.
that headgear comes off, if I see one person's face, even a fingernail, no qualification.
and at some point, we have to rescue someone.
I'll leave when up to you.
chief, don't worry.
I'm gonna take the lead here.
we're good.
Mr. Cox, I am happy to help you in any way I can.
I could do that more effectively if I could talk to my squad.
Oh. Use this.
they're on channel 4.
really, making me use that radio system -- It complicates my job.
and what about my job?!
which is to ensure this squad knows what measures to take in the event of, say -
I don't know -- a nuclear disaster.
sir, this is a homicide division, not a bomb squad.
well, according to the paperwork I have, it's both.
what paperwork?
what is he talking -- what is he talking about?!
what is he talking about?
we just need to finish training.
chief ! I checked into Tiffany.
detective Sanchez, use your inside voice, please.
sorry.
I checked into Tiffany's husband, Bob.
the night before last, he has an alibi -- out to dinner.
and I looked into his finances.
he's an efficiency expert with a highly successful consulting firm.
and his prenup with Tiffany --watertight.
I did a phone dump on Lewis' landlines and cellphones calls from Mrs. Lewis to Glen Cooper, but nothing out of the ordinary like private detectives or divorce attorneys.
if Tiffany charged her affair on their joint credit cards, it's all over their statements.
lieutenant Tao, could you please check Mr. Lewis' office lines?
thank you.
and, uh, lieutenant Provenza -- Yeah.
lieutenant Provenza, how's our parking attendant doing?
Oh, he's still here.
Robbery/homicide's watching him for us.
look, alibi or not -- alibi or not, I think that we should have Mr. Lewis, Tiffany's husband, pop in for a visit.
but I can't send any of you to go pick him up, and I can't send lieutenant Provenza by himself.
Oh, this is a nightmare!
sergeant Gabriel, what did Mr. Cox mean when he says, "according to his paperwork, y'all are priority homicide and a bomb squad" ?
okay.
chief, now, don't get mad.
my entire division is officially part of the L. A.P. D.'s counter terrorism bureau?
well, not Provenza.
when were you gonna tell me about this?
look, i-it's only a paper change.
it's so minor, I didn't think you'd notice.
there are five people walkin' around my murder room in noisy, plastic suits.
how could I not notice?
you know, honestly, when sergeant Gabriel came up with the idea for these transfers to save your section from budget cuts, by the way, I thought you'd be happy.
what are you doing? - I'm dizzy, and my heart's pounding.
it only happens when I get really, really mad.
I thought it was a reaction to my cold medicine.
did we establish that you actually have a cold?
I've been gettin' fevers.
I don't know.
have you considered seeing a doctor?
and when do I have time to do that, Will?
if lieutenant Provenza and I are the entire priority homicide division and I have to do everything myself without any help from anybody and budget cuts -
don't overreact. - And I'm not overreacting!
uh, excuse me. Is this a bad time?
no, chief Johnson was just leaving.
actually, it was her who I came to speak to.
I've been watching this Kenny, your valet guy.
we just pulled in this Bob Lewis character, who sergeant Gabriel asked me to pick up.
I was wondering what you want us to do with the two of them.
thank you, commander, for all your help.
if you could please make sure that Kenny Woods makes it into the electronics room with lieutenant Provenza and set up Mr. Lewis in one of our interview rooms, that would be very helpful.
excuse me.
why am I here?
do I need to have my lawyer meet me?
well, um, if you really think that waitin' for legal representation's the best use of your time, Mr. Lewis, we could certainly do that, but knowin' that, uh, you're an efficiency expert,
I wrote down all the questions that I wanted to ask you.
I thought maybe that you could look them over and decide about whether or not you wanted a lawyer.
let's just get this over with.
where were...
uh, where were you the night before last?
that's Wednesday, the 24th.
business dinner at Mastro's.
you want further details, I'll have my assistant e-mail you, okay?
do you... harm the war?
you're kidding, right?
do you know this man?
what man?
Oh, sorry.
here. This man.
Oh, yeah, that's my wife's fitness trainer, Jeff or Chuck or something.
actually, his name is Glen Cooper.
Oh. That's right. Glen.
and he was found dead the night of the 24th outside Il Primo, a restaurant downtown.
that's too bad.
Tiffany was really, uh, tightening up her stomach.
uh...what is this last question?
do you know about the affect?
affair?
that's seriously supposed to be an "r"?
that is illegible.
wait a minute. What affair?
you recognize him?
is this the guy?
the only way we can keep you safe, Kenny, is if you help us catch the killer.
so is this the guy or not?
no.
no, it's --that's-- that's not him.
do you think someone could swing by my house and get my electric tooth brush?
I-I-I'm supposed to use it two minutes in the morning, two minutes at night.
also, my floss --mint, waxed.
you can get that at any drug store.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
you didn't notice all these charges on your credit cards?
I have a business manager who takes care of the bills.
I hire a lot of people to do a lot of things.
well, I hope she got her money's worth.
so, are we done here?
Yes, sir.
uh, chief, I looked into those...
chief, I am s...
I am so sorry that you had to find out about this transfer this way.
we've -- everyone --we all thought chief Pope had already told you about his -- his decision.
chief Pope's decision?
sergeant, even with your face covered up and your voice distorted by that stupid mask, you are still a terrible liar.
now, stick to the case.
I looked into Lewis' story, and, in fact, he was at Mastro's having dinner at the time of the murder.
that's no surprise.
he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who could bring down someone like Mr. Cooper.
well, a taser could even things out.
Yeah, but does he...
does he seem like the type of guy that owns a taser?
no, but...
no, but he seems like the kind of guy who would hire someone who owns a taser.
we still need a rescue of some kind, and I'm not planning it.
as soon as I'm done with this murder, I'll get right on that.
great, and remember, these people need to demonstrate they can save someone from, one - a life-threatening attack, two - a riot, or three - a natural catastrophe.
I'll leave it to you to decide how that's done.
you have three hours and six minutes left.
lieutenant Tao-- lieutenant Tao,
I need to know what's going on with the Lewis' phones and computers, please.
okay.
starting from the beginning.
no, no, no, no. The end.
quick. Like a bunny.
last Tuesday, a call was placed from Bob Lewis' office to the cellphone of an Eric Ellis.
now, Eric Ellis is not one of our finest citizens.
Ellis has a record --few B&Es, couple of assaults, presently unemployed, which makes the $10, 000 deposited into his bank account on the 22nd so interesting.
could be payment for a hit.
which is why Taylor's guys pulled him in for us.
here's Ellis' record with his booking photo for handy reference.
thank you, lieutenant.
Oh! Oh, for heaven's sake, sit down.
Mr. Ellis, I need to speak to you about where you were at 9: 00 last Wednesday, the 24th.
you mean Wednesday the 25th.
no, I mean Wednesday the 24th, two nights ago.
well, I think I was at the gym on the 25th.
it's the 24th, sir.
and can anyone substantiate that?
Oh, you mean an alibi, right?
Yeah, people saw me Wednesday night.
would one of those people happen to have been Mr. Bob Lewis?
uh, never heard of no one by the name of Bob Lewis...ever.
Really? Well, Mr. Lewis' phone records indicate otherwise, and when I spoke to him earlier about the murder of Glen Cooper -
you spoke to Mr. Lewis about a murderer?
Yes.
so, Mr. Lewis isn't dead?
now you've got it.
so, who got killed?
Glen Cooper -- Mr. Lewis' wife's boyfriend.
on Wednesday the 25th?
it's Wednesday the 24th!
can I see a calendar?
can you explain that whole lawyer thing to me again?
you said you weren't gonna tell my husband about the affair.
uh, it was unavoidable.
I'm sorry.
what am I supposed to do?
I told you about Bob's temper.
why don't you stay here for a while until we're able to deal with your husband?
and, um, lieutenant Provenza, if you could ask Taylor to take Kenny Woods to the restroom for a while, and, uh, put Mrs. Lewis into interview room number 1.
Yes, ma'am.
thank you.
my pleasure.
I'm workin' real hard on gettin' you an attorney, but it would help me a lot if I could take your picture.
is that okay?
Oh, sure.
no, uh, please stand.
thank you.
um, if you could, uh, walk over there to the corner.
and, um...
that's very nice.
now, sort of, um...
slump against the wall, and then slide down...to...the floor.
that's good.
now, uh, stretch your legs out.
good.
now, um, close your eyes.
put your chin on your chest.
good.
now, don't move.
thank you.
thank you so much.
Mr. Cox, I beg your pardon.
I seem to be havin' trouble communicatin' with my squad.
I wonder if you might want to take a look at that.
radio check.
I'll be back in one minute.
sure.
take off.
take off this ridiculous helmet! And the suit!
all of it!
for heaven's sakes.
chief, this could end the entire training session.
well, some things are more important, lieutenant Tao.
now, Buzz, I need you to put on this hat and that suit. Hurry.
you want me to go out there and pretend to be lieutenant Tao?
Yes. Exactly.
do I have to over-explain everything?
Hey!
no, just nod, but you have to do it quickly before Mr. Cox realizes that lieutenant Tao is gone.
I don't know about this, chief.
as long as Mr. Cox thinks that Buzz is you.
he thinks he's someone else on Wednesday the 25th.
you mean Wednesday the 24th.
no, lieutenant, I mean Wednesday the 25th.
lieutenant, I took a picture, and I need you to help me with it.
it's fixed.
looks as if someone took out the battery.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
how did that happen, I wonder?
me too.
good news, Mr. Woods.
I believe we found the man responsible for the murder you may or may not have witnessed.
no, no, I don't want to look at them.
I don't need you to give me an I. D. anymore.
I just want you to feel safe goin' back to work.
I want you to take a look at these photos and let me know if anything jumps out at you, and then...the floss is all yours.
waxed, mint.
you can use it all the way home to your electric toothbrush.
photos.
this one.
when -- when did this happen?
Oh, uh, that happened this morning.
Yeah. Yeah.
that's --that's the guy.
I was -- I was parking an '07 Highlander when I pulled around, and there they were.
and this guy, he -- he wrapped something around the other guy's neck and he pulled...hard.
and I just -- I -- oh...
so you found a phone in the car that you were parking.
and I called --I called 911.
then he saw me, and he ran over, and I froze.
he banged on the window, and he -- he started screaming that he was gonna -
he was gonna kill me if I told anyone what I saw.
then -- then I heard--I heard sirens, and then he --he ran away.
thank you.
just checkin' to make sure you're all right.
do you need anything?
no.
I think I'm okay.
I don't know.
maybe I'm not okay.
well, you can cry if you want to.
I don't want my makeup to get all ruined.
but it's -- it's-- it's hard.
Glen was really nice to me.
and I know guys are nice when they want something, you know?
or maybe you don't know.
but Glen really cared about me, and now he's gone.
and I have no idea when Bob's gonna let me come back home.
maybe I don't even want to go.
well, maybe you don't have to.
we've looked into your husband's story, and the night that Glen was killed, on Wednesday the 24th.
you mean Wednesday the 25th.
no, Tiffany, I mean Wednesday the 24th.
and you're the second person in an hour to make that mistake.
the other person was Eric Ellis, the man who murdered your boyfriend.
but I don't think he meant to kill Glen.
I think he meant to kill your husband.
that way you could be with Glen and not have to worry about that messy prenup.
don't I get any fourth or fifth amendment somethings?
Yes, you do.
you have, for example, the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, the court will appoint one for you.
do you understand what I'm sayin'?
you are going to arrest me for attempting to murder my husband?
no, I'm not.
I would have, of course, if the stupid hit man hadn't made a mistake about what night to follow you and your husband to dinner.
well, that might've been my fault.
I'm not so good with numbers.
but the money that you paid Eric Ellis to murder your husband, that came from Glen, right?
so you wouldn't be connected to your husband's murder.
it's so unfair.
Glen ended up paying for his own death.
I really feel like I let him down.
did you pay Mr. Ellis up front?
what do I look like, an idiot?
I only gave him half.
after you told me Glen was killed, I called and canceled everything.
and I asked for my money back.
Ooh, I should check my messages.
I bet you that blockhead finally returned my call.
um, I'd hold off on that if I were you.
you only get one call, and you might want to use it to contact a lawyer.
what?
but you said...
all right, now, wait a minute, lady!
you told me that I wasn't in trouble for trying to kill my husband!
that's right.
but you are under arrest for what happened to Glen Cooper, which is murder in the first degree.
I didn't hire that guy to kill Glen.
I hired him to kill my husband, and he didn't even do it!
this is a tapestry of justice.
that's what it is --a complete tapestry.
you!
stupid hit man!
stupid, stupid!
you're the stupid person!
you were supposed to kill my husband!
my husband!
I thought he was your husband!
you kissed him!
I don't kiss my husband!
you idiotic...
he's supposed to be dead!
riot!
man down!
man down!
rescue operation in...
I'm goin' -- You're next!
you're next!
you're next!
no, you're next, meathead!
what the hell is going on here?
WMD trainin'.
it's windin' down.
time.
qualification has been achieved.
you may all remove your gear and sign the "q" log, please.
it's okay, Tao.
you can take your helmet off now.
you're Michael Tao?
that's lieutenant Michael Tao.
he's adopted.
hello.
Brenda, this is Dr. Jackson.
Dr. Jackson, this is Brenda.
hello.
since we got a little busy yesterday, uh, agent Howard thought I should stop by, see how you feel.
just, uh, o-one second.
can I talk to you for a moment, please?
excuse me.
I really -- I don't want to do this right now.
well...I do.
okay.
Oh, um...
why don't you have a seat and relax?
and I'll call for you when I'm ready.
I have one minute.
whoop, there we go.
get your mama. Get her.
denied.
mommy, wake up. It's time to play.
I'm late for work and you promised. Ok, buddy, go get your shoes. Go on.
when will a day off ever actually be a day off?
in about 14 years.
come on.
Oh, uh, so, remember, we have the play date with Cameron.
So...you're on your own for dinner. Oh, I'll manage somehow.
I love you, too. I love you.
I love you three. Jump! Come on.
Ohh! I love you four.
you have to go to your mama, ok? Ok.
Yeah! Are you ready to play soccer? Let's play soccer. Ready?
all right, kick it to mommy. Kick it.
Whoa! Score! Say, bye, daddy!
Bye, daddy. All right. Kick it again.
good morning. Breakfast is served.
thank you. Mm. Am I early?
no, no, no. We're running late. We're just having too good of a time.
Hey! Beth! Come and look at our fort.
Wow! You guys! This is inspired.
Where's your cape? I'm wearing it.
come and see inside. Yeah!
we slept in here all night.
it sounds so much fun. I'm jealous.
we're going to do it again tonight, right, Dad?
sure, buddy. No problem.
could Beth sleep over?
could she?
I...
SCI-FI-GATE
I want to see it. It's so cool.
OK, ok, uh, the TV movie is in hall H at 9: 00.
can we go to that? - Absolutely.
you think we can we make it to the Captains of the Enterprise panel at 11: 00?
OBS. Thanks for coming with me. Of course. I've been knitting this scarf for weeks.
Penelope. Kevin. Hi.
you came. And you brought a friend.
CSU Technician Sharp, how are you? Fine. You?
I am also fine. Ok, well, see ya.
you're not gonna go in?
no. Actually, we just went in and it's super lame, so we're leaving.
Oh, ok. Oh, great costume.
Yeah, you, too. That was awkward.
Oh, my God. We used to come every year. I can't believe he brought someone else.
well, you brought someone else.
Yeah. Someone I couldn't possibly be sexually attracted to.
you're welcome? Whoa, Rossi!
why doesn't this surprise me? Are you here for the convention?
who schedules a cigar aficionado event back to back with... This?
I know, right? It's the greatest party ever. Well, it was gonna be.
unless it involves gentleman Jack and pre-embargo Cuban cigars,
I find that statement to be highly dubious. Kevin brought another woman.
I'm plotting revenge. Do you want to help?
no.
now, you know I love you both, but this is Saturday and it is my day off, so I'd prefer to love you from afar.
so, have fun.
it's my bedtime. It's 9 a. m.
you're judging me?
thank you. Thanks.
I don't know. Emily, what's not to know?
it's a beautiful place.
there are cracks in the foundation.
cracks can be fixed. No, they can only be hidden.
they're still there. What, are you afraid the place is gonna fall down?
I'm afraid it's never gonna be as strong as it was.
OK, somebody's heart is not into it.
what's going on? I don't know.
when I first came here, I felt like I was home.
and now, it's just an uphill battle.
people kill for opportunities like this.
am I crazy to walk away? Well, you gotta do what's best for you.
follow your gut. What's it trying to tell you?
thank you.
it's ok, ma'am. Go ahead. Did you remember to bring your key?
Yes. Did you remember your glasses?
Yes. Nag, nag, nag.
over here, sir.
I'm gonna need to see your bag. Ok, sure.
over here, sir. It looks like everyone's setting that thing off today.
sir, over here.
Oh, God. I want to see hands in the sky!
now!
try to trigger any alarm or give me any damn dye packs and you're dead. You understand? Do you understand?!
Yes!
cash in here.
cash in here. Go, buddy.
come on! Time!
1: 45. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, were the Face Cards. Maybe you've heard of us.
we can get out that say before she shoots us. Try it and I'll paint the walls with your wife's blood.
get your faces on the floor already.
I see eyes, you see bullets. Get it?
get down on the ground! Get down on the ground!
0. 00104166666666667
what the hell is that?! I said no dye packs.
what the hell is this? I'm sorry.
Oh, she's sorry. Sorry?
you're gonna be sorry. Please. We'll cooperate.
just tell me what you need. What I need?
well...
this is a bank, right?
what do you think I need?
Oh. Take me to the vault, sweetie pie.
go. Go!
one minute.
all units in the vicinity off Penn and Southeast, robbery in progress at Colonial Liberty Bank.
that's one block over.
shot fired. Repeat, shots fired at the Colonial Liberty Bank. All units.
426 responding.
30 seconds, boss. All right, coming.
on the ground with the others.
what do you mean? We got trouble!
black-and-white. Get down. Down! Down!
side door. Let's go!
faces on the ground.
count to 100. Don't even think of moving.
I said count!
better pull back and see if they respond.
10-13. Officer down. Shots fired. Repeat, shots fired.
fear is met and destroyed with courage.
you ok?
Yeah.
it's definitely them.
I only saw the King and the Jack, but I figure the Queen's inside, too.
the media's calling them the Face Cards. 7 bank robberies in 7 months.
they've killed one person at each robbery. M. O?
single gunshot wound. Each of the victims has bled out.
serial killers with a 30-day cooling-off period and we're only just hearing about this now?
well, headquarters has always characterized them robbers first and killers second.
no one kills 7 people without serious psychopathic tendencies.
I disagreed with the original assessment. I was overruled.
so why are we here now? Because crisis negotiation is overseas.
what more do we know about them?
they're organized, they're efficient. Each strike lasts about 2 minutes.
they gotta be scouting the banks in advance.
why haven't we been able to I. D. them off of surveillance footage?
they hack the security feed and turn off the cameras, both during the initial canvass and during the robbery, until the masks come back on, and then we're allowed to watch.
I can't find anything. No doors, no grates, nothing.
yo! Lynne! What's another way out of here?
just the main entrance and the side door. It's for security.
I know that. You think I'm stupid? What went wrong? We were on count.
I need a doctor. Is anyone a doctor?!
would you shut that kid up! He's a baby. What do you expect her to do?
it's ok, baby. It's ok.
no one asked for your opinion.
it's not just the cops. We've got the Feds now, too. We're screwed.
you have to apply pressure. I can't even feel it.
Yeah, I know. Just push down as hard as you can. Would you focus on what's important.
shut the hell up! He's bleeding out. It's his fault we're in this mess.
nice heads-up on the cops, Olly. Maybe think it was your count that was off, huh?
how bad is it? You're gonna be fine.
I don't want to die.
we're all gonna die if we don't get out of here. You shot a cop.
shut the hell up! You're not gonna die.
we're trapped in here, ok.
but we got one thing they want- all them.
they're using the hostages as human shields.
this is the first time they've been interrupted. What went wrong?
it's a big bank.
it's possible they weren't about to round everybody up before someone triggered an alarm.
why haven't they cut the feed now that they've been cornered?
letting us see inside gives up a tactical advantage. They gotta know that.
they don't seem to care. They're overconfident. Arrogant, even.
the face card masks add to their narcissism. Their personas are the royalty of poker.
JJ, Reid, and Prentiss, look at past robberies. That's gonna be our victimology.
pull another analyst if you need to. Dave, I want you to handle negotiations.
and, Morgan, strategize tactical options with MPD.
chief Strauss.
the Director ordered me to supervise your operation.
puts you right in the spotlight.
well, you've got gunmen with hostages in the Capital. The Hill's concerned.
we're about to open lines of communication. What about a tactical assault?
I don't think it's a good idea. There are hostages in front of the doors and windows.
what's your negotiation strategy? The Jack's bleeding out.
they'll ask for medical attention. The female unsub might have something to say about that.
look at her body language. Mm. She is cold and detached.
the King seems genuinely concerned about his partner's welfare.
but she couldn't give a damn. The men probably know each other.
Yes. Garcia? Shuffling my techno fabulous deck of databases, sir.
Hey, don't look. It's gonna be ok.
we're all gonna die, aren't we?
I'm sure the police will give them what they want.
stop talking!
it's gotta be the Feds.
I'll be right back.
who the hell's this? My name is David Rossi. I'm with the FBI.
to whom am I speaking?
all right, I want a doctor sent in, and then I want out of here.
well, we certainly can discuss that.
let the hostages go and we'll give you all the medical help you need.
I can't do that. I need the leverage.
how about a sign of good faith?
send out the women and children and I'll see what I can do.
he's trying to negotiate. Negotiate? We're not playing games.
no, no, no, please! Daddy!
either we get what we want or everyone in this room dies.
do that and you get nothing. Take me instead. Please.
take me.
it's ok, baby.
daddy!
you better send in some help or more people are gonna die.
we're sending in a medic. That's just gonna give them another hostage.
if they stop shooting people, it's worth it.
if we give in to one demand, we'll have to give in to them all. The Director disagrees.
at least make it an Agent with medical training.
that way he can take advantage of an opportunity if it comes.
fine.
the brass thinks they'll act rationally, but there's no evidence of that.
this is personal for the men.
the King could have run after the initial gunfight, but he didn't.
instead, he pulled the partner inside out of harm's way.
and stayed with him, while the woman searched the bank, presumably for a way out.
he's more worried about the partner than he is about her running away.
Garcia, narrow your search.
I think the male unsubs might even be related. Roger that.
in 6 robberies no one's been able to build a sketch of the unsubs before they put their masks on.
these witness descriptions are all over the map.
probably because of the trauma suffered inside.
they've been zig-zagging north and south but in a relative straight pattern from Washington, D. C.
this is the largest bank they've hit.
before today, it's just been small branches in rural communities.
so today was always a part of their plan.
but why the nation's capital? To make a statement?
I pulled schematics from the previous banks. This is the first one with metal detectors.
maybe that's what went wrong? No, they cased the branches too well in advance.
they'd know to be ready for them. These are takeover robberies.
no faces, no passing notes, no prints. They're professionals.
Hey, there is something all these robberies have in common.
the Queen's the only one who pulls the trigger.
sir, I found a thing. See, I took height and weight measurements and I crossed with known related offenders who specialize in bank jobs and home burglaries.
show me. - Yes.
these are brothers Chris and Oliver Stratton.
they are petty thieves from Philly, turned bank robbers in Jersey.
they were put in jail for two years after an attempted heist went sour, and they were released two months before the first face card robbery, and their measurements are a match.
when didn't the NCIC database connect them?
because the brothers have never used a third partner, and shooting people's not part of their M. O.
it looks like they weren't very successful criminals.
maybe adding a woman to their team improved their game.
the woman chose a different type of victim each time. It's not just the security guard.
it's been a mother, a manager, and a young child. She shoots them in the gut.
they bleed out while they rob the bank.
she's sadistic. She gets off on her victims' pain and the fear it incites in those around her.
move him out of here.
stay with me, Olly. Where's my medic?
I don't see him.
kill someone else, then. Make them listen.
it also appears the King is in charge of the money-grabbing operation while the Queen keeps track of time making sure they're in an out in under two minutes.
she's more in control of the operation than they let on.
turning the King and Queen against each other could be the key to disarming them.
he's not a killer. That could be our in.
only if the Jack doesn't die. If he does...
no, no, no. I want you to put that in your bag.
the woman's probably going to want to search you.
but Chris is gonna be too focused on getting aid to his brother to delay long enough for her to check the bag, too.
all right. You're going in to provide medical assistance.
no unnecessary risks, you hear me?
once you stabilize Oliver, check on the hostage they just shot.
understood. He might still be alive.
do not draw your weapon unless you can subdue the unsubs without endangering the hostages.
Yes, sir.
why hasn't anyone come in yet?
we're sending in the medic now, Chris. Tell Oliver help is on the way.
hurry. They know our names.
not all our names.
is she putting on lipstick?
they're sending someone in.
Chris. Olly, Olly, no.
no, no, no, stay with me. What are you doing?
they're sending in a medic. You're gonna be fine.
I don't feel so fine.
No! No! No!
get over here!
you're gonna save him, right? I'm gonna try.
Oliver, can you hear me?
come on, Olly. Stay with me, Oliver.
this is not good, Aaron. Morgan, tell Green to make a move before Chris does.
green, you gotta go. Green, go.
Oh, my God.
tactical's been deployed, snipers are moving into position.
the Director's ordered a full tactical assault.
his last orders cost us an agent. SWAT's getting itchy fingers.
you remind SWAT that bank robberies are federal jurisdiction.
no one fires until they're ordered to. Right.
all right, when the crossfire starts, what's gonna happen to the hostages caught in the middle?
that's the wrong call, Erin, and you know it. It's not my call.
you're here and you're in charge. So you want me to disobey the Director?
Yes.
no, I just want you to buy us a little time. Don't be quite so efficient.
whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.
all right. Reasoning with them is still our best option.
that'll be difficult. Chris just lost his brother and murdered someone in retaliation.
we're dealing with two killers now. We have problems, sirs.
outside nefarious sources have hacked into the surveillance feeds.
I'm trying to I. D. them now. At least a couple of them are media outlets.
can you block them? No, not without blocking ourselves, too, sir.
put him with the others.
Hey! Everybody move forward 5 feet. Come on! Move forward 5 feet!
line up!
I'm sorry about Olly. Just shut up, would you.
we've got to pull ourselves together, figure a way out of here.
what happened?
who triggered the alarm?
was it you? Calm down. We need to focus.
call them back. Demand an armored truck.
what, you think they're gonna let us go?
we killed 4 people. Two cops.
so what? We don't try? That's just great.
why don't you walk over there. I gotta think for a minute.
whatever you say...
boss.
why'd you have to make it so quick?
it's better when they suffer.
I don't get off on it like you do. You will.
look. We're gonna be famous.
agent Prentiss, there's a call for you from Interpol. Take a message, please.
it's Clyde Easter. Your old unit chief?
he says he has information about the Queen of Diamonds.
two suspects identified.
sorry I missed your funeral, by the way. I was held up in Prague.
so you're not surprised. Of course not.
keeping tabs on my former assets is a particular skill of mine.
OK, what can you tell me about my mystery woman?
Yes. Well, um, if she seems familiar to you, she should.
we don't know her identity, but we've seen her before.
she's struck a number of banks worldwide, including
Paris! There was a robbery when I was relocated there.
someone died. Oh, yes. The bank manager, Glenn Harrison.
gut shot? Yes. How did you know?
I don't remember hearing anything about the robber wearing a mask.
that's because she didn't. She seems to be wearing disguises.
her faces has been seen on camera by 6 different intelligence agencies and no one can identify her.
how is that possible? Wait, who were her partners overseas?
she didn't need any. Then why would she now?
what if the smaller banks were training runs from the Stratton brothers?
well, it could be. She took two relatively amateur thugs and turned them into an elite team of efficient bank robbers.
but why? To turn them into patsies? All right, ok, so let's look at it.
up until now they've been highly organized, striking only on deposit days, when the most amount of cash is on hand.
but today's different. It's their first Saturday hit, where families are present, more foot traffic throughout the day.
it's a riskier attack. We should consider the media attention, too.
it's the first time they've had an audience. That might be why the female unsub is so vain.
she wants to look good for the cameras.
she searches the bank but doesn't actually look for a means of escape.
she appears to be almost enjoying the situation.
we know the brothers are in it for the money. What's she in it for?
where the hell have you been? I've been looking for an escape route.
there isn't one.
so much for your no back doors, no surprises plan. You screwed us.
then why don't you negotiate a way out of here already?
what? How do you want to end this, Chris?
I want out of here. How do you propose to do that?
I want an armored truck and a plane with a clear flight path to Switzerland.
no, no, no. Chad. We want to go to Chad.
Yeah. No agents with guns this time. We'll fly ourselves.
don't do that again. I'm in charge here.
OK, so what's the significance of Chad?
a 2008 coup attempt plunged them into political instability.
they're currently in the middle of a civil war.
there's gotta be more to it than that. Our ghost wants to go to Chad.
I'm figuring you're my best chance of finding out why.
Chad? That's an odd choice.
they're not exactly hospitable this time of year.
they said they could fly themselves there.
nothing suggests that Chris would have that ability, so she must.
well, unfortunately, Interpol doesn't have many assets in that particular region in Africa.
maybe that's something that you could help me with when this is over.
work for Interpol again? That'll be the day.
not work, darling. Run.
you see, I've been promoted.
so, the team's yours whenever you want it. It's a hell of a time to bring that up.
well, you know, in our line of work, there's never a good time.
think about it. Please?
you find me a connection I can use and maybe we'll discuss it.
the FBI's making good on its promise. We'll be out of here soon.
we're taking him with us.
these guys were too good to get caught, so why did they?
911 received a call alerting them to a robbery in progress.
actually, it was a text.
D. C. add 911 messaging after the Virginia Tech students texts went unanswered during the massacre.
can you trace it, Garcia?
Yeah. The message was sent from a cell phone that is currently inside the bank and was registered to a Larry Phillips Jr.
why does that name sound familiar?
that's the name of one of the gunmen from the '97 North Hollywood bank shootout in California.
so is this an homage?
guys, that text was sent 30 seconds before they blacked out the security feeds for entry.
how is that possible?
it didn't come from a hostage. It came from one of the robbers.
she wanted us here.
there's no clear line of sight to the vault.
no, but if we come in, that's where they'll go. We need to be ready for it.
Garcia caught us up. Why instigate a hostage situation?
what's a narcissist without attention? She thrives on it.
she must have something bigger in mind.
we need to separate Chris and the female to find out what that is.
it's not going to be hard. They're already on edge.
it's more than the media outlets, sir.
anonymous international entities are hacking the feeds as well.
headquarters
you were saying?
I was tagging I. P. addresses and someone hacked the surveillance cameras at 7 a. m. this morning.
was that how they shut down the cameras for entry?
no, sir. This is an entirely different hack, one that's still receiving.
somebody else is watching. Who?
whoever it is she's dressing up for. I thought that was for the media.
the media didn't have eyes inside before today. But she dresses up every time.
because someone is always watching. Her real partner, a fourth unsub.
I doubt if she was forthcoming about this other partner to Chris.
I think it's time we bring Chris up to speed.
you know my favorite card in poker, Chris? What's that?
the wild card. I don't believe in wild cards.
they dumb down the game.
well, I couldn't agree with you more, but, uh, in this case, you're the one that's dumb.
this your new negotiation tactic, insulting me? Oh, it's not a tactic.
it's a fact.
didn't you wonder why you got caught, what went wrong when you did everything right?
we got a message from someone in the bank before you started shooting.
impossible.
now, I know it wasn't you, and I'm hoping it wasn't your brother.
so, who does that leave? You're lying.
ask her. Did you call the police?
is that what they're telling you? That's not an answer.
of course not. What do you think? They're trying to turn us against one another.
why would you even do that? Olly's dead 'cause of that.
I wouldn't. I'm trapped here, too.
are you lying to me? We've come to far for you to start doubting me now.
lost too much. Hey.
hey...
don't let them tear us apart right as we're about to win.
if you do that, Olly's death won't mean anything.
enough. I'm done talking to you.
I want to talk to someone who won't jerk me around face to face.
no more Feds. I want to talk to the cop who shot my brother.
no. No, forget it.
JJ, if it means we can end this...
what makes you think he won't shoot you the minute you walk inside?
look, he wants out of there just as much as we want him out.
it's not happening. Forget it.
there's no guarantee he won't retaliate for the death of his brother.
I know you'd do it if you were me.
will, I get what you're feeling, but you are too close to this case to make that call.
you're damn right I'm close. 4 people are dead because I shot his brother.
and no one else needs to die 'cause of what I did.
this isn't about you. Risking your life won't bring them back.
sorry, Will.
Where's that cop, huh? I ain't got all day.
what you're asking is difficult. Well, I'll make it easy.
send in the cop, I'll let a couple hostages go.
a sign of good faith. Isn't that what you said?
releasing the hostages is a great first step in resolving this conflict, but we can't send someone else in to be killed.
this ain't a friggin' debate.
come on, bud. Let's go!
pick up the phone. Why?
pick up the phone!
Hello? Tell him your name.
it's... It's Shawn Harper.
you just killed Shawn Harper. Not me, you.
I'm gonna shoot another hostage every 60 seconds until you send in the cop.
every 60 seconds.
who's next? Huh?
he's threatening to shoot more hostages unless he has Will. Screw this. I'm going in.
no, you're not. We are.
who's the lucky one?
Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah.
you!
No!
no.
pick it up.
come on.
what's your name? No, please.
tell him your name! Annie.
it's Annie. You hang in there, Annie. Help is on the way.
you got about 30 seconds, Annie. I hope Agent Rossi doesn't make me shoot you, too.
you ok? Yes.
Hey, you. Come over here.
it's ok. No, I...
just let the women and children go. They don't need to see this.
pretty soon they're gonna be doing a lot more than just seeing.
Annie! You just got yourself a reprieve.
get in line over there.
look at our new contender. Let's go!
go, go, go! ????
what is he doing? No. No, no, no.
no, no. Morgan- Let me go, please!
I can't do that. Will! Will! Will!
Will...stop.
my name is Matthew Downs. Look.
let those people go.
all right, you, you, you. The kids. Get out.
got 3 coming out. Hold your fire.
thank you.
Hey. What's your name?
william LA Montagne Jr.
MPD.
did you see where he was shot?
is he alive or dead, Garcia? I don't know.
he was wearing a vest. He might be ok.
might be.
they're not answering. All right, we need to get inside.
JJ, it's too risky. We don't have eyes in there anymore.
let's go in.
hold your hands right there.
what are you doing?
a dead cop isn't going to be much of a negotiation tool.
boss, are you good with this?
what? Yeah, fine.
you ok?
I shouldn't have done that. They're never gonna let us out of here now.
who knows? Maybe they'll save him and he'll be our ticket out of here.
you took my advice. How's that?
you didn't go for the kill shot.
right.
I need to check the back again. There's gotta be an escape we haven't thought of.
OK.
his blood pressure's dropping.
hold that. Are you holding it as tight as you can? Yeah.
how's JJ? It's bad, Reid.
I should be there. We've learned everything we can from here.
no, you can help more by helping me. There's a lot to got over and your brain works faster than mine.
seeing what's going on outside doesn't help us inside.
Kevin, can you possibly pull up each of the surveillance feeds prior to Will being shot?
sure. What are we looking for? The female unsub disappeared once before.
if she was looking for an escape, what was she doing?
I'm sorry.
keep the pressure. Keep the pressure. The pain won't kill him, but the loss of blood could.
just hang in there, buddy.
are you armed? No.
damn. I think we might have something of a chance here.
what? The girl's gone, and the guy's off his head.
he doesn't know who to trust. We can work them against each other.
wait, are you a cop? A former marine.
you gotta listen to me. I need you to get a message to my girlfriend.
all right, you can tell her yourself when we get you out of here. Only I'm not getting out.
you need someone to cause a distraction.
her name is Jennifer, and she's a federal agent.
you tell her I'm sorry. Sorry?
don't you want to tell her you love her or something?
she already knows that.
the woman.
what happened to her? Aren't you dead yet?
you can't trust her. She's taking orders from someone else.
no, she takes orders from me. Look around.
any second agents are gonna storm into this place, and the only bad guy I see is you.
she's setting you up to take the fall for this, boy.
that's not true. Then where is she?
she's back there.
all right. You. Come here.
I'll show you. Go on.
come on!
where are they going? He's giving us our chance.
we've got movement. Somebody's coming out. Be ready.
it's hostages. Copy. Standing by for entry.
what the hell are you doing down here? Calm down. You'll find out soon.
tell me.
we're going in.
she was following the electrical lines... gas mains. Oh, no.
Garcia, get them out of there!
abort! Abort!
JJ, are you all right?
are you ok? Where's Will?
where is Will? Did he get out of there?
Where's Emily?
here I come! Police!
there's been an explosion at Colonial Liberty Bank in the judicial district.
authorities right now at the scene say they don't yet have a casualty...
I can't get through. Even the SAT phone's got a busy signal.
what do we do? What are we supposed to do? I'm gonna get over there.
again, breaking news-- an explosion at Colonial Liberty Bank, killing a possible 24 hostages and an unknown number of law enforcement agents.
what is going on here? You didn't profile this as a suicide mission.
because it wasn't. They'd never kill themselves. What the hell do you call that, then?
they didn't improvise a way out. They've had an exit strategy in place.
you don't learn explosives overnight. We're looking for signatures on the bombs.
I need every fragment of every device that you can find, no matter how small or destroyed it looks.
I also need eyes on every angle in, out, and around the bank.
you have photos of the suspects.
we're going to continue to cross-check those against international connections.
do you have a positive I. D. on the woman yet?
no. Not yet. We need more agents.
Where's Homeland Security? They just got here.
sir, I've see Morgan and JJ, but I haven't seen Emily.
Emily? Over here!
you all right? Yeah. They were hiding back here.
can we move them? Yeah, with help. He's unconscious.
just let me stay with him.
please.
I can't find Will. Have you seen him? He might be down below.
we're gonna get you out of here.
he's my love of 66 years.
my story.
Yeah. No, it's bad, but I'm all right.
Yeah, just don't come into the city.
and can you take Jack on the bike ride today?
right. And can you put him on?
Hey, buddy, listen, um, I gotta work, so Beth's gonna take you on the bike ride, ok?
all right, I'll see you later. Can you keep the media busy?
is that all? - For now.
Yeah. You? You all right.
do me a favor. Have that ear looked at.
if this one's parallel to some Metro tunnel, there's a good chance it branches off.
all right, then we split up. Unless it's a trick.
well, then we're screwed.
is this the work of a terrorist cell?
we do not believe that they are part of any terrorist cells.
the bank heists point to them being independent anarchists with homicidal tendencies.
do you consider them serial killers? What was that?
are they serial killers? Yes. Without a doubt, the suspects are serial killers.
as Agent Hotchner told you, they want you to admire them.
leaving the cameras on was their way to brag about how much fear they were creating.
we need to know what happened, specifically the unsubs' behavior in the minutes leading up to the blast.
you'll be interviewing the survivors. They'll be in various stages of shock, but any information you might get could be the key to apprehending these suspects.
agent Hotchner has compiled a series of questions for you to ask them.
these questions are on your phones now.
thank you.
you're all right.
what are you doing here? It isn't safe.
I didn't want you to be alone.
I'm not. You know, they separate the President and the Vice President at times like this.
What...are you comparing us to POTUS?
I'm saying that you should be at Quantico running point. Well, I'm here right now.
what can I do? Ok. I need to analyze every frame of this video.
morgan and JJ said that the blast created a hole between the underground vaults and these tunnels.
you know, most of these older banks are made of granite or limestone for longevity.
so she knew to use a combination of C-4 and semtex to open her escape route.
the tunnels let out at multiple points running west. She could still be underground.
I know. This is what she does. She probably waited till the last minute to exit.
she wants to see all this chaos. We need to find the tunnel exit closest to the bank.
looks like it's two blocks here, just outside the perimeter.
what you got? Will always say, if you can, you leave a bread crumb.
OK, so he was here, and clearheaded enough to leave us a clue.
they shot him, Morgan. Why would they take him?
JJ, I don't know, but we didn't see any blood down there and he's not here. Both are good signs.
Yeah, but they have him, God only knows where or why. How's not good?
what the hell is that? You recording it?
I'm talking to you, Izzy!
you planned this whole thing. You didn't tell us any of it.
you set us up. You killed my brother. No, that would be him.
how do I know he isn't your partner?
why would I work with this guy? Why would you do any of this?
FBI said you got somebody else.
you sound jealous. Who is it?
put that away. This isn't about revenge, it's about survival.
if you haven't figured it out by now, I'm your only way out of this mess.
all right. Let me kill him so we can get on with it.
we need him. For what?
leverage. We have to patch him up. What, are you gonna walk him into an E. R?
JJ and Morgan said the unsubs were in an alley northwest of the perimeter.
Yeah, this footage confirms it. Ok, I can see two figures in the car.
please tell me one of them is Will. See how she's turned.
it's like she's keeping an eye on someone in the back. Does this mean Will's in the car?
there's somebody back there. What's the license plate?
that's weird. They're government tags.
federal. - Federal or district?
well, they're either stolen or forged. Who the hell are these people?
they set up roadblocks in the district from 66 to Dulles.
wait. So we're looking for a black SUV with its sirens on.
that's gonna stand out.
will's with them. I found his wallet.
it benefits them to keep Will alive. They must have a safe house set up.
whoever their outside man is, that's where they're heading now.
but where? What's their end game?
there's no logical reason. They want to create panic.
she's struck all over the world, which says she might not be American, but her ideology certainly speaks to Washington.
whatever point she and her partner are making, it's important that D. C.'s the setting.
the brothers were from Philadelphia. The other partner might be homegrown as well.
homeland's sending over a list of possibilities. They're not on anyone's list.
then how do we find them?
we find the common denominators between all 14 robberies and we go from there.
so she's our only answer. For now.
I'll call Easter at Interpol again.
now that there's been an explosion, he might have some ideas.
I'm so sorry about what happened. Is your team all right?
no. One of our own was taken hostage during the escape.
they made it out of that? Yeah. In a stolen government vehicle.
we've seen that before. Remember Scotland Yard '04?
a sedan was stolen from the impound lot.
Yeah, uh, security footage verified it was a woman, even though she was never caught.
no, but they found the car.
she left behind some fake I. D.s and weapons, and that's where she got her moniker, Lady X.
right. Everybody figured with that arsenal and her ability to evade, she was trained, probably an assassin.
two days later an ambassador was killed.
shot in the stomach. The question is, what assassin doesn't go for the kill shot?
this one. She's sadistic. Yeah. Fits your profile, I take it.
well, yeah, it's gotta be the same woman. She killed at each robbery.
the banks were simply a means to fund today's explosion.
even if she wears wigs, she doesn't mind showing her face, because she knows we won't find it.
we've only got one other thing to go on-- what she left behind.
what about Chad? Is there any connection? No, no, nothing yet.
but, um, if I had more help, say, running the London Gateway office, you'd have your answer much quicker. Yes, you should fix that.
well, I'm trying. You have always had bad timing.
Oh, come on, Emily. Don't you miss this?
think about it.
Yeah, I will.
all right. Yeah, I got it.
that was the lab. Semtex and C-4 like we thought.
red, blue, and yellow wires in each, old cell phone used as a detonator.
how old is the phone? - 10 years.
that's specific and rare. Ridiculously.
well, has anyone seen it before?
it was last seen in a number of bombings in Chad.
for a signature that specific, they must have been there to learn it.
did Easter have any insight?
a woman they called Lady X stole a sedan from Scotland Yard 8 years ago.
the investigation concluded she was a trained assassin. She disappeared.
so Lady X and Queen of Diamonds is the same person? It sounds like it.
Garcia, look at assassination attempts around the civil unrest in Chad.
if she was a hired gun, she was likely taking orders from someone.
maybe she's still working for the same guy now and he's still pulling the strings.
or maybe she's found her equal.
their obsession with killing and domination has culminated in what we've seen today.
getting off on the disaster they've created. Classic symphorphiliacs.
then this isn't over. Far from it.
no. Now that they've gotten away with this, where are they gonna strike next?
district OF COLUMBIA
morning.
yeah? - We need help.
Oh, is that a gunshot? - Obviously.
he's gonna need fluids. There's a hospital 3 blocks from here.
there's no time. Fix him.
will's definitely with them, and it looks like he can move without a problem.
cameras caught everything? Yeah. The woman killed the medic.
Hey, at least Will's ok. Yeah, for now.
did they leave in the same vehicle? Yeah, but it's been an hour since the explosion.
why haven't they left the city? The next attack could be here.
Kevin, what have you got? Just going through...
they did that on purpose, right? And you saw everything until they had Will.
well, they made a mistake.
leaving the cameras on gave us much more information than they realized.
what time did the 911 text come in? 9: 23.
the bank opened at 9: 00. Let's go back to the beginning. I need you both on this.
Yes, sir.
he said he'd call by now.
Hey. Yeah.
got it.
that was fast. Change in location.
get back on Pennsylvania Av.
I'm not going anywhere till you tell me the plan.
what are you doing? He talks too much.
go ahead, officer, get him out. And do what, just leave him here?
Yes, please.
sorry for the mess.
go ahead. Drive.
the explosion was a distraction so they could escape. Watch.
allow me to fast-forward.
all right, here's where Chris started shooting hostages.
the fella next to him didn't even flinch. Doesn't even break a sweat.
we know he's ex-military, but still... His name is Matthew Downs.
that's what he told Rossi and he wasn't lying.
history shows dishonorable discharge from USMC in '04.
Hi, Will. You see that?
I want to do it again. We will.
drive. You know the way.
drive.
OK, do me a favor. Keep going.
to where Will walks in.
OK, now watch him.
and then... look at her.
her partner was in there the whole time, just not in the way that we thought.
they shot this whole thing like a home movie. He could have been killed.
no, she wouldn't let that happen. What the hell are they doing?
it's all part of their plan.
they've created scenarios that are practically impossible to survive.
when they make it, it's the ultimate high. Like an adrenaline junkie.
nobody can find Matthew Downs. ERT said that he helped them, then he disappeared.
see you later? You better.
come on, officer. He's a detective.
I'm sorry, dick.
you better play nice, just like we talked about.
close the gate. Daddy.
Hey, pal. Hey, Will.
how are you? Thanks for taking care of the little man.
let me put you down while I talk to miss Kate. Ok, daddy.
you haven't been watching the news?
I heard about what happened, but no, I didn't want the kids to see it.
you guys working the case? In shifts, yeah.
OK, well, if you need Henry to stay, it's no problem. Well, uh...
I'm Izzy, Will's cousin. Oh, hi. I'm Kate. Nice to meet you.
she just--she just flew in. She's gonna take care of him, so it's all good.
all right, well, if you need anything, let me know. Ok. Sure thing.
Hey, Will. Get some sleep. You look like hell.
he's still in diapers? I don't really do those.
you touch my kid, I swear to God I'll kill you.
I already told you, you touch me, he kills her, then you.
do you really want to do that to your kid, be the reason he's an orphan?
daddy, let's play.
daddy can't play right now. I gotta go to work.
but this is, uh...
can you say hi to Izzy? Hi, Izzy.
she's gonna stay with you till mama comes home, ok?
OK. Hey.
I love you.
I love you.
come here.
it's gonna be ok. It's gonna be ok.
all right. I love you. Go play back there.
of course Will thought Matthew was a hostage. Why wouldn't he?
there's a good chance Will tried to help him out.
he told him when to go for the doors or offered to be a hostage to save the others.
I'm sure he did. Well, there's a flip side to this.
this guy could have gotten into Will's head.
is there anything you want to tell your family in case you don't make it?
you think Will told them about JJ and Henry? Unknowingly.
what's wrong? Will's license is gone.
they know where we live.
Hey, check it out, Will. Mine looks...
it looks almost as good as yours, huh?
I wasn't sure if I was gonna need you at all, but this way, it's more fun.
what do you want? Well, it's simple.
you do everything I tell you or Izzy kills your boy.
there is no way out. Let's don't believe the hype you're the hero.
today's not the day for that, Will. Come on, we're late.
don't do that. What?
go all quiet. What am I supposed to do?
yell.
I can't. You can't blame yourself.
want to bet?
I should have never left Henry today. You were doing your job.
I'm a mom. And a federal agent.
I'm a mom first.
who had no possible way of knowing how this thing would go.
we made this deal, Will and I.
that Henry would never be alone without either of us.
I broke that.
he'll forgive you.
why are you doing this?
why am I doing this?
you ever been in combat? No.
soldiers don't come back and kill innocent people.
you were sick before you ever went to war. You've never been.
it wasn't the same after.
they just cut you off, you know?
everyone. Your family. The Corps. The country.
goodbye. We used you.
it's a betrayal. So what did I do?
I found a new home.
detective. You on lockdown?
no. We're diverting all traffic. Official vehicles only.
we're just here to do a sweep.
Yes, sir. Go on through.
I thirsty.
you need to draw it.
you're silly.
can we play hide-and-seek? In a minute.
come here.
my grandfather's name was Henry.
he had blond hair just like you. He was a scary man.
Why?
let me tell you a story.
so why didn't they take all the money?
they were a man down and they had to get out in a hurry.
but for her, today was less about the money and more about the spectacle.
everything they've said and done was for a reason.
but what doesn't make any sense is she switched the negotiation demand.
Chris wanted to go to Switzerland. She changed it to Chad.
they also requested a private plane, but no mention of a pilot.
guys, if you think about it, even the dates mean something.
in 2004, while she was wreaking havoc abroad, he was dishonorably discharged.
then in 2008, they likely met in Chad. And now this in 2012.
OK, so is it a coincidence that those are all election years and they attacked D. C?
maybe this is a political statement.
no. It's more personal than that.
it's their story. What?
all of the details are a part of their story.
their timeline suggests they were both destructive before they met.
so we're talking about ex-military turning on their country.
it's rare, but soldiers become disenfranchised no matter what the nationality.
and if he met someone like-minded at that time, there'd be no stopping them.
so you're thinking they met during the civil unrest in Chad in '08.
Yeah, and one or both of them are pilots.
so if Garcia concentrates on that region, specifically weapons running in and out of Libya, there's a good chance we'll find their paths crossed.
OK, multiple entries into Libya for a private pilot named Matthew Downs in '08, but I don't have her name. Well, because she had aliases.
it's the only way to stay a ghost. Here's the thing- they are a couple.
regardless of what we believe of them, they will celebrate themselves and their connection.
is there anything that happened on this date in Chad?
Oh, you are good, Emily Prentiss. But this news is not.
Yes, there were multiple explosions on this date in '08.
where were the most casualties? At a church-- no, no, a train.
Yep. Morgan; Semtex and C-4? Are trains still arriving at Union Station?
she doesn't have her cell. Kate would never take her eyes off Henry like this.
they must have him. Wait.
we need a distraction.
I thought you cared more about your family, Will.
he's gonna want to stay close to watch.
please proceed with caution to the nearest exit.
thank you.
MEEZZANINE CLOSED FOR RENOVATION PARDON OUR DUST
Hotch, I got the suspect going out the east wing.
copy.
I found Will. Is he mobile?
negative. He's got 6 transmitters on him and this whole place is gonna blow.
all right, where are you? I'm on my way.
no, you gotta get everyone out. Is the bomb squad here yet?
they're 3 minutes away. Copy.
Emily, you gotta get Henry. They're at the house.
turn around.
mommy!
come here. Mommy.
just get everybody out of here.
I'm not gonna leave you. Just give me a minute.
just about all you got. Ok, everything they did and said was about them.
narcissists. Romantics.
they met in 2008.
Oh, what are you doing?
seriously, Emily, go.
go.
OK, hold on. Chad.
2-4-2-3.
Oh! Damn it.
OK, these are valentines for her, so a 4-letter word. Love, life, soul.
Izzy. Her name is Izzy.
Oh, God!
Prentiss, what's your status?
Prentiss, do you copy? The storytelling's in the details.
those wires mean something. Like what?
the colors of the flag of Chad. Red, yellow, and blue.
only one is different from the U. S. flag--yellow. What do you think?
how did you do that? I didn't overthink it.
they say I need another X-ray.
Hey, come on.
no tears. It's ok.
Henry's safe. It's all gonna be fine.
ask me again. What?
ask me.
Jennifer Jareau, will you marry me?
Yeah.
Oh, it's about damn time.
there's a chaplain here. Let's just do it now. Let's just get it over with.
hell, no. I'm not the one that's supposed to be in the gown.
all right, fine. Monday, then.
clear your calendar, 'cause we have a date at the courthouse.
the convention's still happening tomorrow if you want to go.
that whole city on the brink of destruction thing kind of took the wind out of my sails, you know?
that'll do it every time. We didn't finish the inspection.
no need. What happened?
there is a horizontal crack in the foundation.
it just weakens the entire base that the house is sitting on. Yeah. That does not sound good.
so, our unsub is Izzy Rogers.
she'll be charged with multiple counts domestically, and our international counterparts will have their turn with her.
she will never see the light of day. I just thought you'd like to know that.
agent Morgan, a word?
I, uh...
I haven't had a chance to speak with you.
I sort of hit the ground running.
it took a lot of courage to confront me about my drinking.
you changed my life. Thank you.
honestly, ma'am, that's not necessary. A simple "you're welcome" would suffice.
I'm just glad you're back.
no, you're not. Hang on, let me check.
Oh, wait, she's here. Erin, don't go anywhere.
Dave wants to know if everyone is free tomorrow night?
well, it depends on if he's buying. Then I'm definitely in.
Yeah, me, too.
you hear that? We're in.
Emily, look, I know you don't want to talk about it, but it's exactly why we need to talk about it.
this has nothing to do with cracks in the foundation.
no. But it's a sign.
Oh, please don't get all free spirit on me.
I almost blew up yesterday, twice. I know.
that's about as grounded as you can get.
you want to leave, don't you?
I didn't say that.
it's the only reason you would be this quiet, Emily. Can we please talk about this later?
no.
how long have you been thinking about this?
honestly... Since I got back.
Really? It's not you guys.
I love you.
I just can't grab on to my old life and pretend that nothing happened.
is this about Easter? No.
but he did ask me to run the London office.
and you're gonna do it. He just asked yesterday.
but you're thinking about it.
I don't know yet. I
I thought buying a house and putting down roots was gonna fix this feeling, it was gonna give me what I wanted.
but it hasn't.
it's bigger than that.
you think I should stay.
I think I miss you already.
what?
Uh-uh- I'll tell you later.
I do not like the sound of "I'll tell you later."
it's JJ's night, and I don't want to...
all right, if you are telling me that there is something bad happening right now to balance out the goodness that is tonight,
I will have none of it, because I don't believe in that.
although it's totally one of the truths of life.
isn't it? The bitter and the sweet mixed up together in a cosmic soup that we've all signed up for.
breathe. Breathe. I think Kevin's here tonight.
it would make sense that he would come tonight.
he's here. He's here and he's with her, so I'm gonna go somewhere which is not go somewhere that is not-- that is not here.
hello. Hello. Hi. Hi, Penelope.
Hi. Hello.
Hello, Emily.
Hi. It's nice to see you again. Oh, it's nice to see you, too. Hey, Derek.
Hey, Beth. What's up, Hotch?
Oh, look out. Look who it is.
little man Jack. Give me some. Hey, guess what.
they got a really cool fountain right over there. You want to check it out with me?
sure. I want to see, too.
all right, come. Go. Go, go, go, go. How are you?
that bad? What?
that's your tell. It is?
for how long? Uh, ever since I've known you.
well, you have one, too. I do?
Yeah. Only I'm not gonna tell you what it is - Or you'll stop doing it.- I see.
do you want to talk about it?
Absolutely.
but not now. First thing tomorrow.
it's a date. Ok.
Hey.
someone knows how to throw a party.
you don't mess around.
what can I tell you? I'm the host with the most.
no kidding. Hey, look who's here.
mom...
OK, what's--what's going on?
well, we couldn't get married without your mama.
I might have overheard a little proposal yesterday.
and I couldn't wait till Monday.
OK, so this is why you guys are so dressed up, huh?
Yes. And you will be, too. I brought something borrowed.
mom, is that your dress? Yes.
let's go see if it still fits.
OK.
mom...
so, nervous?
only if she doesn't come back down.
they s that good things happen to good people.
today is one of those days, and these are two of those people.
we love you.
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.
I've always heard every ending is also a beginning and we just don't know it at the time.
I'd like to believe that's true.
ocean LOLINGE WAIKIKI
how'd I let you talk me into another round, huh?
come on.
we need to decompress.
Yeah, decompression is for the day after the special election, especially when your guy only has a two-point lead.
when are you gonna take it out of fifth gear?
people are still getting used to the idea that Senator Chang died in office.
they'll warm up to our guy, once the shock wears off.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe you're right.
what's the plan for tomorrow?
debate prep, campaign rally downtown, fund-raiser, and then in the evening there's a cocktail party for some big-money supporters.
whoa, this thing is really moving at warp speed.
Yeah, you know it.
well, the saving grace is that it will all be over...in two weeks.
Yeah, and then we'll either be looking for apartments in DC or job hunting.
Cheers.
okay, okay, okay, you convinced me.
I'm gonna go back to the office, crunch some more numbers.
being around all these beautiful people having a good time, that's just...
not the greatest motivator.
and I'm saying good night.
Oh, sorry. Good night.
what, are you sticking around?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna, uh, decompress a little more.
decompress. Sweet. I will, uh, see you bright and early.
bright and early. - Bright.
and early.
Belvedere dirty martini.
from the gentleman at the end of the bar.
Hey, handsome.
please... please don't do this.
don't do this.
I swear to you I told you everything I knew.
please...
I believe you.
you, uh, you look, uh, very nice-- suit and tie; that's good.
it's for you. Wore it for you.
thank you.
all right.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
is that a clip-on?
it's not a clip-on.
are you...What'd I just say to you?
your tie's all jacked up-- can I fix it, please?
come here. Come here. Come here.
thought nobody wore a tie in Hawaii.
no, they don't, but, you know, it's a special day, so I thought I'd wear one.
course, I'm wearing my dress blues.
they'd make me walk the plank if I don't wear a tie with the dress blues.
how come the blues are black?
I know they're black; I don't know why...
thank you very much for being here-- it means a lot. Okay?
you're welcome.
you'd do the same for me.
all right, you ready?
Yeah, I'm good. I got, uh...
the speech all prepared, everything's...
good. - Good.
tell you something, they take her away from me, I'm jumping off a cliff today.
Hey, hey, hey. That's not gonna happen, - Okay. - Okay?
Danny. - Okay.
all right? That's not gonna happen.
that's not gonna happen all right?
in the matter of Williams v. Edwards, where are we?
your Honor, my client has prepared a statement he'd like to read into the record.
go ahead.
excuse me.
sorry.
your Honor, uh...
I, uh, I come before you today.
okay, I'm sorry. Can I start over?
thank you.
uh, Your Honor.
I come..." That sucks.
detective Williams, why are you littering my courtroom?
I apologize. I really apologize, Your Honor. But...
um, I was prepared to give my speech to Rachel, my ex, but she's...
she's not here.
weren't you told that your statement should be addressed to this court?
Yes, I was, I was, but...
I know how busy a family court judge can be, right, presiding over cases much bigger, more serious than mine.
so I thought that I would appeal directly to Rachel.
go on.
okay. Okay, look, I,um...
I had a pretty good life in New Jersey, uh, and then...
I came here.
and it wasn't exactly a fit.
uh, the sun...
sand-- I mean, I can't even get a decent slice of pizza.
get to your point, Detective Williams.
okay, I hate this place.
I apologize, but I do.
but I was willing to put up with it, because this is where my daughter is.
and now her mother wants to move again, and I-I can't go through with that.
not to Vegas, not anywhere, because this... is my home.
this is our...home.
your Honor, that little girl is-is my everything.
she is my life, she is my breath.
and it may just be the two of us, but we...are a family.
and separating us by two thousand seven hundred and fifty-four miles of water is not...
something this court should allow.
detective, weren't you recently shot in the presence of your daughter?
I can...I can explain that, Your Honor.
commander McGarrett, this is not your forum.
Yes, I know that, Your Honor, and I'm sorry, but...
detective Williams doesn't just work for me
he's my friend, he's my close friend-- and, uh...
I've seen him with his daughter.
he's a great father.
he's actually the kind of father we all wish we had.
I'm so sorry. I have to take this call.
Yes, Governor?
she was found like that in a mansion in Kahala.
we got an I. D?
HPD is still working on it.
but here are the preliminaries.
all right.
we'll do everything we can to help, sir.
I don't want you to help, Commander
I want you and your Five-O task force to take over the case.
and I need it cleared quickly.
well, uh, HPD Homicide is very good...
and I need it done quietly.
Yes, sir.
if I may ask, what brought this case to your attention?
the people who own the house are friends of mine, close friends.
very dear friends.
I'd like the matter to remain private.
okay, well, I'll need to talk to them.
you can't. - Why not?
they're trekking in Nepal; completely unreachable.
I'll need to confirm that, sir.
I'm confirming it for you right now.
keep me in the loop, Commander.
I want constant updates.
and don't go through the office.
call my cell directly.
understood, sir.
all right, send him in.
hold on, let me get this straight.
is this official business, or is this a favor?
what difference does it make?
well, it makes a very big difference, you see, because official business is, uh, official.
a favor is like a quid pro quo kind of deal, right?
you...
solve this murder case for me, and I will give you, uh, oh, five days' paid vacation. Right?
or tickets to Monster Truck Jam, or whatever.
monster Truck Jam's not in town.
okay, so then it is, indeed, official business.
exactly.
Exac...? Wh-What...None of this seems strange to you? Hold on.
none of this seems, uh, in the slightest bit off?
I mean, what are these homeowners?
they, uh, big contributors to the governor's campaign, or what?
I have no idea.
and we can't talk to them?
Danny, is there a point coming anytime soon? - Absolutely.
it seems to me like we're taking a case just to protect the governor's friends.
with the governor's task force.
then why does it feel like we are performing janitorial services, blindfolded, I might add.
we've been given a directive, Danny.
Oh, right, I understand.
when McGarrett gets an order, he takes the order.
you know what you're like?
you're like one of those windup toy soldiers.
let me get you a drum for Christmas to beat.
the last time we butted heads with Denning, he sent Lori home.
I don't want to see what he's got planned for an encore, do you?
okay, here are some basics.
the homeowners' names are Wendy and Patrick Duggan.
I checked into their passport records.
they landed in Katmandu last week.
according to their itinerary, they're halfway into their hike.
well, confirms what Governor Denning told us.
how do you think the cell service is on Everest?
I can't imagine it's too good.
we got any signs of forced entry?
no. Other than the Duggans, the caretaker's the only one who claims to have a set of keys.
HPD checked his alibi.
it's airtight.
Max give us a COD?
he hasn't posted the vic yet, but based on the bruising around her neck, he's thinking she was strangled.
maybe it was a crime of passion, right?
killer's having sex with the vic, then he gets a little rough, things spin out of control.
you got anything else?
Yeah. Max found traces of a powdery substance around her left clavicle.
he sent it over to Fong for processing.
I got an I. D.on our vic.
her name is Serena Andrews.
HPD had her in their database.
what was she cited for?
solicitation.
Houston, we've got a problem.
so we have a working girl killed in a Kahala mansion belonging to good friends of the governor.
two questions: did the governor know her, and did he know that she was a prostitute?
and if he did, is he involved?
you like the way this is going?
no, I don't.
Serena didn't make it home last night.
not exactly a big deal.
so she often stays out all night?
look, I'm her roommate, not her mother.
but she is a friend of yours?
Yeah.
how long you guys been here?
six months.
mollie, do you know that Serena was cited for solicitation?
that was over a year ago.
what about you-- you ever been busted?
I'm a student.
pretty pricey place. Student loans cover this?
I don't like what you're insinuating.
I'm not insinuating; I'm asking.
what's an all-night trick go for these days-- two, three grand?
what I do with my body is my business.
and when a body shows up dead, it's ours.
Oh, my God.
she was found dead at 3500 Hunukai Street in Kahala.
do you know that address?
no.
truth.
look, Serena didn't usually work with locals, okay?
just high-end tourists or conventioneers.
how did she hook up with the johns?
there's this thing called the Internet.
maybe you've heard of it.
Where's your laptop?
so, if we can find the last john Serena booked, it could lead back to our killer.
her clientele wouldn't use their real names, though, would they?
probably not.
then again, the guys we're dealing with usually aren't thinking with their heads.
not the big one anyway.
okay, okay, copy that.
let's just get Serena's laptop over to Fong and see if he can trace the last IP address.
that could be a while.
Why?
what's wrong?
black SUV two cars back-- you see it?
Oh, hello.
Yeah, it's been tailing us for the last two miles.
Yeah, okay, thanks, Max.
Hey.
Tod on Serena Andrews was between 11: 00 and 12: 00 last night.
Max just confirmed that she had sexual intercourse just prior to the murder.
so there's DNA.
Max just put a rush order on it.
lab should have some answers any time soon.
I just got off the phone with the lab.
did we get a hit?
I don't know.
you just said you got off the phone with the lab.
I did, yeah, and they told me they are on strict orders not to rush the testing.
orders from whom?
governor Denning's office.
SUV's still on us.
that's three straight lefts.
doubt they're looking for a parking spot.
how do you want to play it?
hold on.
Five-O! Get out of the car now!
Hey, hey!
what the hell was all that about?
I don't know, but did you catch the plates?
G" ride, yeah, government issue.
commander, Commander, you cannot go in there.
am I running this investigation or not?
give us a minute, please.
don't ever do that again.
why'd you ask me to take over this case if you're going to interfere?
there is a chain of command here, and you're not anywhere near the top.
there is a state vehicle surveilling my team.
sir, the lab can't process the DNA on your orders.
why are you blocking every move I make?
my orders are not subject to your scrutiny, Commander.
what the hell are you hiding, Governor?
just what the hell are you implying?
the dead girl-- you knew she was a prostitute.
the DNA we found on the body-- is it yours?- No.
is it yours, Governor? - No!
no, I did not know the victim was a prostitute, and no, it is not my DNA.
I don't know what to believe here, sir.
when I run that DNA...
who is it going to trace back to?
congressman Christopher Freed?
Yes, our soon- to-be senator.
I don't understand.
politics, Commander, plain and simple.
protect your flank at all costs.
protect your ass is what you mean.
Chris Freed and I go a long way back.
I told him I'd help out any way I can.
he needed a place in town to stay, I knew these party donors who were away, so I arranged it for him to stay at their house
the same house Serena Andrews' body was found in.
okay, why didn't you tell me the truth when you handed me the case?
because a scandal like this could ruin a good man's life and his chances of being elected.
you didn't think I was gonna find out?
I was hoping to contain your findings as they came in, determine if they were credible.
if they were, act accordingly.
you have to understand, Chris Freed is a Medal of Honor recipient, chairman of the Veteran Affairs Committee.
and now he's a suspect in a homicide investigation.
he is also my friend, Commander.
we served together.
of all people, you know what that means.
and, may I add, he is also a devoted single father, so I wanted to be damn sure that the facts were straight before we rip his life apart.
with all due respect...we just found a dead prostitute in his bed.
so I have to ask you-- as his friend, I have got to ask you...
do you think it's possible Congressman Freed could have killed this woman?
I don't know.
okay, you know what we call this in police work? - What?
congressman CHRIS FREED'S OFFICE WAIKIKI
a complete and total waste of time.
just listen to me.
anybody knows where the congressman is, it's going to be his press secretary.
he's not gonna tell us anything.
these people lie for a living-- you know that, right?
this guy. - All right, we got anything over there?
excuse me, Josh Lowry?
I'll have to call you back.
uh, yeah, who are you?
steve McGarrett. This is Detective Danny Williams.
we're with Five-O. - Hi.
Hey, we're looking for Congressman Freed.
Yeah, Five-O, thank you guys for coming down, and you know the congressman is a huge supporter of the law enforcement community.
uh, can we get you guys anything-- coffee or water?
no, we're good, we just want a minute with the congressman.
Yeah, you know what?
I-I wish you guys had called.
I could have saved you the trouble.
due to the accelerated campaign schedule, the congressman-- he's, he's wall-to-wall today, guys, he's very busy.
very busy.
Yeah, slammed actually, but I'm sure I can answer any questions you guys might have on the issues.
I-I have a question, actually.
Yeah, maybe you could tell us, what's the congressman's position on dead hookers found in his bed?
strangled dead hookers.
um, you know, why don't we, uh, why don't we speak in private?
sure.
no, there's no way.
there's got to be some kind of mistake.
the congressman would never get involved with a prostitute.
his stand on the exploitation of sex workers is very clear, and as far as murder goes...
let me guess, he's completely against it.
do you even know the congressman?
uh, about as much as you can know somebody in a 15-second sound bite.
okay.
all I'm saying is, spend ten minutes with the man.
you'd be absolutely convinced at how outrageous your accusations are.
now, if this country had more men like Congressman Freed...
there'd be a chicken in every pot and a dead ho in every bed, right?
look, uh, I've been with him since his days in the State House. Okay?
I'm not saying he's perfect but pretty damn close, and the mere suggestion that he could be possibly involved in something like this is incredibly insulting to him, to his family, and to his legacy.
okay, that is a, a beautiful speech.
okay, where is he?
Mr. Lowry, if the congressman is as big on law enforcement as you say, then you understand, we have to do our job.
now, where is he?
we're not going to ask you again.
geez. Ah, boy.
we've been spinning all morning to cover for him.
Oh, you don't even know where he is?
no, we don't.
you didn't think to tell anybody?
look, the political reality is this: the special election is a nail-biter.
we haven't had any time to campaign.
now, any little thing could tip the scales.
now, if news got out that Freed was off the grid, yeah, let's just say that'd be bad.
no, no, I'll tell you what'd be bad.
bad would be "Breaking News Story: Congressman Freed, Suspect in a Homicide.
Josh, level with us.
all right, where do you think he is?
all I can think is that he and Amy are somewhere, holed up, preparing for the debate.
who's Amy?
Amy Davidson-- she's Freed's chief of staff, one of his closest confidants. She runs the campaign.
well, where is she, Josh?
I don't know, I don't, I really don't.
I'm assuming with him.
so, if I'm Congressman Freed in the middle of a special election, and something goes wrong...
who's the first person you call?
my chief of staff Amy Davidson.
right, so you can get together and plan an alibi.
any luck pinging the congressman's phone?
no, no signal.
okay, well, try Amy's.
chances are, we find one, we find the other.
Hey, Steve, hold on, Kono's got something.
you guys aren't gonna believe this.
the lab finally processed the DNA from the dead girl.
they got a hit.
congressman Freed?
no.
then who is it?
the match came back from the National Database to a Ryan Webb.
he's an associate professor of English from Ohio.
he's in town for a mystery writers convention.
what's a teacher doing in the system?
he's employed at a state school. They require DNA for background checks.
uh, the IP address from the hotel matched Serena's last appointment.
according to the hotel, he's scheduled to check out this morning.
I got it.
here, here, let me help you with those bags.
what is this? Who are you?
Five-O. We're extending your stay.
hope you had a nice visit.
please, this is all a colossal mistake.
I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
a mistake? Well, why don't you help me understand?
Where's the congressman?
congressman who?
congressman Freed of the great state of Hawaii.
is that supposed to mean something to me? I...
party last night, remember?
mansion in Kahala?
last night?
last night, I-I was on an Elmore Leonard panel, and a bunch of us went to the room to watch Get Shorty.
Yeah, you left the part out about the dead prostitute.
what?
no. No, no, no.
obviously, fiction isn't your strong suit, Professor, 'cause we have your DNA, and it puts you in bed with the hooker at the congressman's house.
look, look, come on.
I'm just an English teacher, okay?
I don't know anything about a congressman, and I didn't kill anybody!
nice wedding ring, by the way.
how long you been married?
wait a minute.
maybe your wife in Ohio knows where you were last night.
let's give her a call, see what she got to say then.
wait, wait, wait.
Serena was alive when I left her.
well, how did you wind up with the congressman?
I didn't. Okay, the girl and I-- we never left the bar.
bar? What bar?
have you ever been to Lima, Ohio?
I mean, come on.
this is Hawaii. I-I just wanted to have fun.
so, I-I found this Website, and Serena-- she agreed to meet me at the Liki Tiki Lounge.
wait a minute. You're telling me you had sex with her at the bar, is that what you're saying?
when-when she showed up, well...
we-we did it in the bathroom.
I've always wanted to do that. Back in Lima...
then what?
then-then she left.
what time was that?
about-about 10: 00.
what did you do after that?
I stayed and had a few more drinks.
same bar? - Yeah. No.
if you don't believe me, you can check my credit card, okay?
I ran a tab, and I cashed out at last call.
bartender confirms seeing Serena Andrews leaving the Liki Tiki Lounge around 10: 00.
well, what about Webb?
credit card checks out. He closed the place.
okay, so, 10: 00 was the last time anybody saw Serena alive.
and with TOD set between 11: 00 and 12: 00...
there's no way Webb could have killed her.
we're back to square one.
not exactly. Just got a call from our friend Josh Lowry.
looks like Freed's Chief of Staff, Amy Davidson, just walked into campaign headquarters.
Josh, where's Amy Davidson?
she's inside with Powers.
Brad Powers. That's, uh, Freed's opponent. What's he doing here?
well, he came by to discuss the ground rules of the debate with the congressman,
I was handling the situation.
then all of a sudden, Amy shows up.
picks up right where she left off, like nothing even happened.
did she say where she was?
no, she didn't.
she went behind closed doors with Powers, they've been in there ever since.
Josh, you disappoint me.
I don't know what kind of campaign you're running here, but I don't buy Amy's spin for a minute.
we're not spinning anything, Mr. Powers.
Really?
then what's Five-O doing here?
that's between us and the congressman, sir.
Yeah, well, when you see him, please ask him why he blew me off last night without so much as a phone call.
what time were you supposed to meet him?
0.458333333333
I've know Chris Freed for 15 years.
he's never pulled a stunt like that.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding, sir.
he said he wanted to run a civil campaign, one with mutual respect and all of that.
this is a hell of a way to show it.
I don't know what you people are hiding, but I'm gonna find out, and when I do, so will the press.
okay. We need to speak to Amy now.
I got Five-O here. They need to talk to you.
miss Davis, where's Congressman Freed?
I don't know, but I think he might have done something terrible.
don't you think I'd help you guys if I could?
I just don't know where he is right now.
okay, so, you-- where have you been?
I was out...looking for him.
look, you don't get it. This is complicated.
then speak slowly, all right?
because I need to understand why a man like Congressman Freed would risk everything to get serviced by a prostitute.
to tell you the truth, I brought her to meet the congressman.
that's a smart move. Why'd you do that?
doesn't happen all the time, but he's under a lot of stress, and he's a single father, so he's on his own.
I mean, besides his daughter, there's...
there's really no one else in his life.
so sometimes he just needs a little companionship for the evening.
so you're chief of staff and part-time madam for him?
come on, the guy's human.
all right, Amy, I have to ask you.
to the best of your knowledge, has the congressman ever hurt any of the women he's been with?
rough stuff doesn't seem to be his thing, but you know, who knows what goes on behind closed doors?
okay, well, something happened last night.
where did you find Serena Andrews?
picked her up at a place called the Liki Tiki Lounge, and I dropped her off at the mansion in Kahala.
no, you delivered her to the congressman, like a pizza.
Yes.
what about the congressman's 11: 00 with Powers?
why did he blow that off?
I don't know.
that's why I went back to the mansion.
but when I got there, he was gone, and I found the girl in the bed.
and being the pragmatic political operative that you are, you decided to go to the governor instead of the police?
because I knew they were friends, and I needed time to think.
to plan a cover-up.
No!
no. Look, something like this has national repercussions.
okay, you need to have a viable strategy.
what time did you pick up Serena Andrews?
9: 00, 9:15?
she was right on time.
am I under arrest?
Amy might be a good chief of staff, but she's a terrible liar.
all right, the professor was shot and now Serena in a bathroom stall at 9: 15.
she didn't leave the bar till 10: 00.
you're right.
if I'm right, then why isn't she under arrest?
cause we still have to find the congressman, and if he's on the run, chances are he's gonna reach out to her.
so let's sit on her phone, post a surveillance team at her door.
exactly, and let Freed come to us.
the thing I want to know is, why is Amy lying?
what do you got?
that powdery substance Max found on the body?
ir Spectroscopy identified it as cornstarch.
cornstarch?
specifically, the type used in surgical gloves.
it makes them easier to pull on and off.
that explains... - Why we didn't find any prints belonging to our killer.
that does not sound like a crime of passion.
that definitely sounds like the killing was premeditated.
so, why would the congressman plan on killing a prostitute he just met?
unless he knew her previously.
or there's something we're not seeing here.
or unless he didn't do it.
so, I traced Amy Davidson's timeline.
guess what? Doesn't add up.
Ah, she was lying.
very shocking.
she said she picked up Serena Andrews from the Liki Tiki Lounge at 9: 15.
but when I ran her credit cards, it turned out, she was having drinks at another place called the Ocean Lounge.
by herself? - She bought two rounds.
two drinks each time.
who she was with?
Josh Lowry, congressman's press secretary.
he confirmed it.
said they were having a strategy session.
he also confirmed that they didn't leave the place together.
according to a bartender I spoke to, she left with an unknown male companion.
we need a positive ID on that companion.
it's gonna be tough.
no security footage from the bar.
I found an ATM camera across the street.
nice.
only thing is, I don't think there's a clear shot of the exit.
not so nice.
okay, easy.
what it did give us was a shot of a police cruiser pulling someone over near the club entrance
we got a dashboard cam?
Yeah, we have a dashboard cam, and I have footage coming through right now.
that's Amy. Freeze, Kono. Freeze that. Can you push in?
looks like she's with someone.
it's Wo Fat.
he's still on the island.
what the hell is he doing with Amy?
he's using Amy Davidson to set up Congressman Freed.
set up for what?
think about it.
who stands to gain if Congressman Freed takes a hard fall?
his opponent, Brad Powers.
wo Fat sees this special election as an opening.
he's on the run, he's got no resources.
what better way to rebuilt your empire than to buy a politician?
right, by discrediting Freed, Powers definitely gets the Senate seat.
and Wo Fat gets a friend in Washington.
quid pro quo.
not on our watch.
you need to start writing.
go to hell.
I expected a more dignified response from a congressman.
cut me loose, and I'll show you how dignified I can can be when I pound the crap out of you.
you're not thinking this through.
why should I sign the equivalent of a suicide note?
that'd be the end of my career, my life.
even if I sign it, you're going to kill me anyway.
a homegrown treasure like you?
a bona fide war hero?
no.
I have too much respect for your accomplishments.
however...
my affections don't extend to your daughter.
where is he?
excuse me?
wo Fat. Where is he?
we know you left the bar with him.
okay, you need to leave.
I don't think you understand who you're dealing with.
no, I said, you need to leave.
everything you've said up to this point is a lie.
all right, the congressman with prostitutes, you bringing 'em to him, all of it.
okay, I can't talk to you guys about this right now.
get this through your head, okay?
if Freed's not dead already, Wo Fat will kill him.
you understand what I'm saying?
you can stop this.
you can stop all of this, but you have to start talking to us.
where is Congressman Freed?
where is he, Amy?
what are you doing?
don't shush me. What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I did it because he said he was gonna kill me.
listen to me, where is he keeping the congressman hostage?
I don't know! - Amy...
I really don't know.
get down. Amy, get down!
I don't see him, Steve.
everybody, get down! Get down! Get down! Get down!
there goes our lead to the congressman.
what is that?
wo Fat?
Hey, Chin, we need a trace right away.
I'm sorry, Congressman.
looks like there's been a change in plans.
geez, brah. You scared me.
I thought you was a pig.
think of how much easier this could've been if you had just signed that letter.
get lower to the ground!
come on, come on. Go closer!
grab his leg!
come on!
come on!
he's hit! Let's go! Come on!
how bad is it?
bad! We need a hospital right now! Go!
wo Fat, Danny!
forget it, let's go! Forget it!
let's go! Come on! Come on!
so, how's the congressman?
no major organs were hit, just soft tissue damage.
he's gonna be all right.
all right.
what about Wo Fat?
the entire department is searching the jungle.
got a perimeter set up, helicopter in the air, everything.
you find anything in the abandoned house?
Yeah, a cell phone.
wo Fat left it-- must've been in a rush to chase down the congressman.
and judging by the call log, looks like we were right.
he was trying to buy himself a powerful ally.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you so mu...
nice to see you again, Mr. Powers.
relax.
what the hell are you doing?
bad taste in friends, buddy.
Bradley Powers, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.
would you please stop? Please? We didn't have a choice.
we had to let Wo Fat go.
and we are going to find him. I promise. Okay?
you mind if I join you guys?
Hey. Of course, Governor.
sit, sit. We're not on the clock.
Oh, uh, I got to take this. Sit down, please.
your brand?
Yes, sir.
thank you.
what's the occasion?
powers cracked under questioning.
he admitted he was in bed with Wo Fat.
Really?
Yeah. He almost pulled that one off, huh?
I owe you.
no, sir. Just doing the job.
no. You went above and beyond, Commander. And...
I'm sorry.
sir?
I should've been straight with you from the start.
trust - it, um...
well, it's a mighty big word.
Yeah, it is.
and if I may...
of course. I'm sitting in shorts, drinking beer with you.
all right, fire away and don't hold back.
I got a lot of respect for you, sir.
got a lot of respect for the office.
but if this thing between us is gonna work out then...
honesty is the best policy.
your predecessor, she didn't believe in that and, uh...
well, it got her killed.
that was her. This is me.
to Five-O.
all right.
Hey. Hey.
you all good?
she's not moving.
grace?
the judge ruled in my favor-- shared custody.
she cannot leave the island.
she cannot leave the island.
Congratulations. - Thank you, buddy.
Congratulations.
thank you.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
uh, the judge said that your courtroom behavior was completely unacceptable - Oh, come on.
and despicable, but she also said that you were a fantastic character witness, so thank you very much.
you're welcome.
I'll remind you of that later.
I'm sure you will.
well done, gentlemen.
I can't believe I'm actually happy to be staying here.
neither can I.
to Hawaii.
to Hawaii.
to, uh...
to Hawaii. Okay. Okay.
to Hawaii.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
mom, next me can I pour the milk?
we'll see, sweetie.
you have to be able to get it in the bowl.
Ariel... -I can do that.
I pour good.
you don't pour good, you pour well.
okay, so when can I start pouring?
as soon as they get rid of gravity.
first we have to promote you to cereal pouring detail.
I'm getting a promotion?
starting tomorrow. We'll start with the cereal, we'll see how it goes. Then we'll think about milk.
I'm getting a promotion!
girls, keep it down to a dull roar. Your dad's still sleeping.
no, he's not.
aren't you going to have any breakfast?
this is breakfast.
I got out of there ten of 2: 00, and what is it now-- it's 7: 20.
I've got to be back there in 45 minutes.
it's been over a week now like this.
no wonder you're so tired.
they got guys working on this project in their late 20s.
they're out of there, like, 7: 00, 8:00 at night.
they can do the work while talking on their cell phone at the same time that they're checking a blog and e-mailing a friend.
I'm barely 40, and I feel like an antique.
well, that's crazy. You've been there nine years.
you have more experience than anyone else.
Yeah, I cost them more than anyone else, too.
I just... I can't shake the feeling that this project is some kind of a bake-off.
that when it's all done, the winner is going to get a pat on the back, the loser's going to get shown out the door.
what do you mean loser?
it's a project, not a contest.
how do you know?
I don't know.
well, okay then. I work there. I do.
I feel like I never see you.
that's because you never do see me.
I don't get a kiss?
huh?
nothing. I'll see you tonight, or whenever.
sir? -Yep.
I have those parole applications you asked me to take a look at.
great. Anything in there jump out at you?
not really.
just a collection of horrible human beings looking for a little mercy despite the fact that they had none for their victims.
Yeah, today is the day. Parole board hearings. Yahoo.
nothing like spending time in a concrete bunker listening to a bunch of vermin swear that they've seen the light, found the way, and if only you'll let them out into society they'll cure cancer and make the world safe for old ladies and orphans.
care to come with?
is there a problem?
Oh, no. I just have to pick up my girls from school.
Joe's been working crazy hours on this project.
that shouldn't be a problem. This will only take a couple hours.
so how does this work?
it's pretty cut and dried. The prisoner is announced by the parole board.
he's given an opportunity to make his statement-- express remorse for his crimes.
once the board has her his request, they'll ask if we have any objections.
tell us about the crime you committed, Mr. Cosgrove.
I shot my wife.
you shot her 16 times, Mr. Cosgrove, in the back.
you killed her.
what the board needs to determine at this time is do you regret that you committed this crime?
I do, sir. I regret it every day of my life.
I'm a very different man from the one who arrived here ten years ago.
I work hard to be a better person. I gave my life over to the lord.
would the state care to comment?
due to the heinous nature of this crime, as well as to the fact that, to my recollection, this prisoner has never shown any remorse before this hearing, the state would ask that parole be denied at this time.
the board is inclined to agree. Parole is denied.
don't worry, just one more to go.
the board will now consider the petition of Mr. Sam Elkin.
you've served five years of a life sentence, and this is the first time you've been eligible to appear before the parole board, correct?
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.
tell us about your crime, Mr. Elkin.
Mr. Elkin?
you know what I did.
it's important that we hear it from you.
I guess I kidnapped my girlfriend...
my ex-girlfriend.
we broke up about a month before...
she broke up-- it was her idea.
I wait for her in her car. I had a key.
she used to let me use it. Anyway, I waited for her.
I knew she'd be going out. It was Tuesday.
she always went out on Tuesdays.
I forced her to drive out into the desert.
and once we were there, we... we did it.
I... I made her do it.
when we were done, I just, uh, started choking her.
she was tiny. It didn't take long.
it was almost morning by then, so I drove her car back into the city with her dead body in the passenger seat.
pulled into a busy car wash on Bell road.
the kind with two lanes-- one where they clean the inside, and an express where the car just goes through unattended and they clean the outside.
once the car was inside the wash, I, uh, just turned and walked away.
that's what you needed to hear, right?
it's my understanding that until you became eligible for parole this month, you repeatedly denied committing any of these crimes.
uh, yes, sir.
and I regret that, sir.
Mr. District attorney?
while I am moved to finally hear Mr. Elkin admit to these heinous acts,
I can't help but be suspicious of his motives.
Mr. Elkin is, after all, well aware that taking responsibility for his crimes is a condition of his parole eligibility.
perhaps his apology and remorse will carry more weight when he has another five years to sleep on them.
Hello?
I'm lonely.
Hi, lonely. My name's Joe.
so what do you think? What are the chances i'll see you before today becomes tomorrow?
uh, you wouldn't happen to know what the temperature in hell is, would you?
you haven't heard anything about a big freeze, maybe?
they didn't mention it on the news, no.
Mm. Then I'm probably going to be here for a while.
talk to me. Tell me about your day.
I sat in on a parole hearing today.
heard this guy confess that he killed his girlfriend.
I got this strong feeling that he didn't do it.
And?
and I just had a dream about him kissing this woman.
the dead girlfriend? -Someone else.
you know what I think? I think you've got kissing on the brain.
no one's kissed me on the brain, or anywhere else for that matter, for quite some time.
Oops.
I think break time is over.
love you, too. -Love you, three.
whatever you want, you're going to have to do it yourself.
not funny.
when did you get in?
I don't know. I couldn't bear to look at the clock.
I really have to get some sleep.
I just found out the client's coming in tomorrow at 3: 00 for an update.
Oh, crap. -What?
did we ever get my suit pants fixed after the cuff came unraveled at Christmas?
"we"? If by "we,"you really mean "me," then no.
"we" didn't know about your cuff.
okay, forget it. I'll wear shorts and a t-shirt.
I can go straight from the meeting to unemployment and then directly to the car wash to look for a job.
hey... there is a tailor who works at the mall by city hall who does alterations while you wait.
I can drop them off first thing and pick them up at lunch.
on second thought, bring those brains of yours over here.
I think I do feel like kissing them.
no, I just felt him there, and he was standing over my bed, just looming there.
and then he leaned down... and then he kissed me.
you'd better not be playing solitaire on that computer.
it's almost 2: 00. You're cutting it close.
you're welcome.
I'm sorry. There was a thank you in there. You just didn't hear it.
well, you're right. I'm running late.
the strangest thing happened to me on the way over here.
I saw this woman.
she looked just like that girl I've been seeing in my dreams--the one who keeps getting kissed?
she was going up an escalator. I was going down.
geez.
there's no reason some stranger in a mall should be getting all the action.
I'm sorry i haven't been around. Thank you for lunch.
you tip all the delivery people that way, or was that special for me?
forgive me, Mr. Dubois.
I just wanted to remind you we're going to be leaving in approximately 30 minutes.
I'm all over it, Edrick.
I'm just going to grab a bite to eat, and then I'm going to change.
Edrick, this is my wife, Allison. Allison, this is edrick, who is single-handedly making it tough for mere mortals like me to have to work anything less than a 24-hour day.
I need your help...
first generation American.
my parents didn't speak much English when I was born, but they loved Mmerican names.
couldn't decide between Ed and Rick.
nice meeting you, Mrs. Dubois.
thirty... -minutes.
I'm counting the seconds.
the Elkin case?
Sam Elkin? Why would you want to revisit the elkin case?
it's five years old. The case is closed. The accused man confessed.
call me old-fashioned, but if you want to revisit old cases,
I'd certainly prefer that you find one that's unsolved and where the guilty party isn't already behind bars.
I told you yesterday I felt strongly I'm start to regret taking you to come with. Tat. D I told you yesterday i complete agree.
he was lying...about feeling badly, about being filled with remorse, about his supposed concern for Amanda Crane's friends and family.
I have court. -Mr. District attorney...
Allison, look at the coroner's report. -I did.
then you know that Elkin's sperm was still inside the victim when we recovered her body.
there's got to be something more than just your sense that this man wasn't being truthful.
I've been having this dream...
this womam is not the victim-- she's lying in bed in the dark.
her lover comes up and steals a kiss.
sounds romantic.
up until last night, the man had no face.
now I see it's sam Elkin.
I'm not sure I know what that means.
I'm not sure I know what it means, either, but I actually saw this woman today, a block away from here at the mall.
seems to me there must be some reason i'm dreaming these dreams, some reason I met Elkin yesterday, some reason I crossed paths with this woman today.
go talk to Scanlon. If the two of you can find something in the file worth looking at...
thank you.
excuse me, uh, I'm looking for detective Lee Scanlon.
that's his desk over there. Must have stepped out for a second.
excuse me.
uh, you look a bit upset. My name's, uh, Allison Bubois.
I work with the district attorney's office.
I was wondering if I can be of some kind of help to you.
I don't know.
I've been waiting to see a detective since early this morning.
I came here with a friend. We waited for an hour and a half, then they told us to go away for an hour. So we took a walk around the mall, came back.
then they said it would be another two to three hours.
my friend finally had to leave. I'm missing a day's work.
you know what? I work with one of the detectives here.
let me see if I can't get him to talk to you.
Oh, thanks. That would be great.
I'm sorry, miss...?
kathleen Walsh. I'm not married.
Mrs. Dubois explained you've been waiting a long while. What can we help you with?
well, I should tell you, I called the police yesterday morning.
they came by my house, but...
start from the beginning. Tell us what happened.
six months ago, I moved to Phoenix just before the start of the school year. I teach music.
anyway, I found this wonderful apartment for very little money.
but shortly after i settled in, I began to hear noises...
only at night.
they'd start just as I was getting ready for bed.
do you have any pets?
a cat-- Boots.
but I've had him, like, forever. He doesn't make these sounds.
okay, so you heard there sounds...
Yeah. I would call out, but no one would answer.
uh, this would happen...like, three, maybe four times a week.
so what'd you do?
I didn't think that there was anything to do.
I wasn't certain that there was anything really there...
so frankly, for a long time, I did nothing.
but then the noises started to change.
what do you mean? Change how?
well, there was this clicking sound.
clicking?
a camera. -Huh?
I was wondering if you thought it sounded like a camera.
um... I don't know.
okay. Whatever it was, there's this new sound.
and I ignored that for a while, too.
but then two nights ago...
I felt him there...close.
he was standing over the bed.
forgive me for asking, but how do you know that? How do you know he was there?
stand up.
excuse me?
would you stand up, please?
close your eyes.
any questions?
no.
and then?
he kissed me.
so what'd you do?
I screamed.
and then he was gone.
and then I called the police, and then the police came over. And then-
I have no way of proving this...
but I think they laughed at me.
whoa, hold it, you're... I want to make sure I've got this right.
you're not alleging that this guy raped you, struck you, fondled you?
a man broke into my apartment...
and he kissed me.
miss Walsh...
you're going to tell me to change the locks, move in with a friend...
buy a big dog?
can I see you, Allison, uh...in private for one second?
what are you doing to me? -What am I doing to you?
shouldn't the question be what are you gonna do for that woman?
uh, no. I don't think so.
what is your problem? She's clearly being victimized.
she came to you for help.
victimized?
a man keeps breaking into her apartment.
maybe. -No. Not maybe.
based on what she's telling me, the police who went into her apartment couldn't find any evidence of a break in.
and obviously, there's no witnesses. -She is a witness.
I don't think so. To what?
to the breaking and entering.
well it doesn't actually appear as though there was any breaking.
which would lead me to suspect that there probably wasn't any real entering, either.
so what do you want me to do?
protect her. -From what?
this dangerous band of marauders and thieves who may have broken into her place and stolen, what, a kiss?
what are you so hot about? You don't even know this lady?
didn't you just tell me you met her ten minutes ago?
I know what she's telling us is true-- I saw it.
Oh, you were there?
and I saw something else, too.
a man who's serving a life sentence for a murder that i don't think he did, he was the person doing the kissing.
you're not making much sense, if the guy's still in prison.
I know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.
what do you want me to do, Allison?
miss. Walsh...you ever heard of a man named Sam Elkin?
no. Doesn't ring a bell. Why?
uh, never mind. No big deal.
I've conferred with Mrs. Dubois here and we've decided to post a visible police presence right outside your building.
they'll be there 24 hours a day, and if anyone comes in or out, they'll see it.
additionally, we'll set up a direct phone link to your apartment.
if anyone does come in, you just pick up that phone and we're there.
Wow. That's great.
I was just hoping that maybe you could send someone over to take a second look.
Really?
I wouldn't hear of it.
this kissing thing, that's not something i want to play around with.
well, thank you.
and thank you, Mrs. Dubois.
Oh, no, it's nothing. That's what we're here for.
Absolutely. That is what we're here for.
Hello?
Hello?
are you here?
are you watching me?
Hey.
you're home, and it's not even 12: 00.
will wonders never cease?
you'd almost think that I lived here.
I missed you.
I hate waking up and having dreams and not having you to share them with.
well, good.
because I suspect that pretty soon, not only will I be around during the middle of the night, but quite possibly during the day, as well.
what are you talking about?
well, we went to see the client today, and it's like I was invisible.
nobody really wanted to hear from me.
it was the Edrick show. All day, all the time.
you know, the guy's been an engineer for 15 minutes, but it's like he's Galileo the way they hang on his every word.
honey...
and not just...not just the client, but the senior guys from our firm, as well.
I know that.
I used to get that look.
that's the "you're the future of this company" look.
hmm, I think you're exaggerating. I met Edrick.
he bows at your feet. He worships you.
he's got me lined up in his crosshairs.
he covets my parking space.
he lusts after the senior vice president nameplate on my office door.
he pines for my four extra vacation days a year.
and you know what the surprising part is
I don't think i really give a damn.
it's good to be home.
and you?
any more kissing dreams?
mm, the kissing has stopped. There is no kissing.
no real clarity, either.
interview Elkin again?
whatever for? -I've been having these dreams.
all of them are very similar.
up until last night, I thought they were about this blind woman, Kathleen Walsh, being kissed by a man who has no features, being kissed by Sam Elkin.
but then last night, I had the same dream, set in the same place, but Kathleen is gone.
Elkin's dead girlfriend, Amanda Crane, is in her place.
and this suggests?
I don't know, but I'd like to try and find out.
I don't have it, and I couldn't do it.
I left here at 10: 30 last night.
no matter how much I try, I can't design with my eyes closed.
the drawings, the silicone diode-- I don't have them, I'm still working on them.
sorry, kid.
I need your help.
excuse me?
all my work.
I sent it down to qc, double-check the specs.
none of it checked out.
the quality control guys called it gibberish.
it's only a matter of time before everyone upstairs hears about it.
I need your help, Mr. Dubois.
so what'd I do?
well, that's what I was hoping to figure out.
I don't know if you remember me. My name's Allison Dubois.
I work with the district attorney's office.
I was here for your parole hearing the other day. Sat right over there.
you waiting for a thank you?
it's gonna be a long wait.
well, no, I'm not here for a thank you.
I'd just like to get some questions answered.
well, I don't know. Depends on the questions.
I mean, what's in it for me?
looks like I'm gonna be in here the rest of my life.
I'm not what you'd call highly incentivized.
okay, well, let's start with an easy one then.
why did you sit there the other day and plead forgiveness for a crime that you didn't commit?
I mean, I know your lawyer must have told you your only chance of parole was for you to come in and sit there and tell the board what they wanted to hear, but I'm here to tell you, I strongly suspect that you did not commit that crime.
now, I'm not on the board, and I'm with the district attorney's office, but I'm no attorney, so I can't really promise you anything.
but if you have a story to tell, I would like to hear it.
and if I believe you,
I will do everything I can to be sure that everyone listens.
I loved Amanda Crane.
she was a college girl, I was a guy who fixed cars.
her friends didn't think much of me.
her family didn't think much of me.
but I loved her.
we went together for months.
used to spend almost every day together.
every day except Tuesdays.
at first, she was always coming up with excuses.
I have a test, I have a paper due.
then she switched her story on me.
said she had a job, she had to work.
didn't really bother me at first.
didn't think much of it.
then I lost my wallet one night, had no money to get home.
I went over to her dorm, she wasn't there.
it was 3: 00 in the morning.
next day she tells me she was working all night.
"doing what?" I said.
that's when things started to get strange.
for a while, she wouldn't tell me, but I wouldn't let it go.
I was like a dog with a bone.
finally, one night, she tells me.
she met a man.
he offered to pay her way through school.
all she had to do was go over to this apartment he owned.
when she gets inside, she puts on a blindfold, spends the night.
and do what? -Exactly.
that's what I wanted to know.
she swears to me, she's not doing anything.
she just puts on a blindfold, takes off her clothes, puts on a nightgown, goes to bed.
got up the next morning, put her clothes back on, took the blindfold off, and walked out the door.
and that was it?
so she said.
I asked her if he was there.
she said she supposed so, but she never heard him, never felt him, never sensed he was there.
I didn't believe her at first.
I used to drop her off a couple of blocks away. She'd let me use the car.
then one night, I followed her.
she caught me before she got there.
she was furious.
we had a huge fight, broke up.
I'd call her, she wouldn't answer.
I'd go over to her dorm, she wouldn't let me in.
that's when she got the restraining order.
I stayed away for a month, but then I couldn't take it any longer.
I went over to her dorm.
damn near busted the door down.
her roommate threatened to call the cops, but Amanda finally let me in.
roommate took off, and we had another huge fight and then, a huge cry...
and then, we made love.
I told her I was going to find a way to pay for school.
I was going to do it.
she told me she loved me, she missed me.
she was going to quit. She was going to find a way to tell that guy that night.
that was the last time i saw her.
next thing I know, they found her car at that car wash.
my DNA was everywhere. It was inside the car, inside her.
I told them my story, but no one believed me.
ma'am?
what are you thinking?
I was thinking, have you ever met Kathleen Walsh?
no, I don't think so. What does she look like?
I'm thinking she looks a lot like this guy's next victim.
so what you are saying is that there's this man who likes to watch women sleep?
I'm not going to even pretend to know what he likes.
you think this is the guy who's been sneaking into your friend Kathleen's apartment?
well, she's not my friend, but yes, what I'm saying is i feel very strongly the man who's been watching kathleen is the same man who was watching Elkin's girlfriend, Amanda, and very well may have been responsible for her death.
you know, when I was preparing for Elkin's parole hearing, I remember reading his statement.
this crazy story about his girlfriend having a job, only he didn't know where, and he didn't know with whom.
I know, it sounds so bizarre. -Bizarre?
no, it aspires to "bizarre."
Allison, this man's sperm was still inside her when they found the body.
Yeah, they made up the night before. He went by her dorm. Her roommate saw him.
precisely, he was in violation of the restraining order she took out against him.
not exactly the kind of thing you want to put in front of a judge in hopes of reopening a case.
what if we could catch him?
you lost me.
well, we know he likes Kathleen.
so what if we can remove the visible police presence outside the building, the squad car, the patrolman?
are you suggesting that we use this woman as bait?
we might be able to do it safely. Wire the place up so we could hear everything, hide a bunch of swat guys.
we're already providing round- the-clock police protection against an intruder i'm not convinced even exists!
now we're talking about spending more of the taxpayer's money to catch someone you think might have committed a five-year-old murder, for which we already have someone in prison?
doesn't matter-- won't work unless Kathleen Walsh agrees to stay in that apartment without a police car standing watch outside her building.
which I'm guessing might be a tough sell.
well, can't we at least ask her?
it's 11 minutes past 8: 00. She might not have left for work yet.
it's up to you.
hello.
ms. Walsh, this is district attorney Devalos.
I'm sorry to bother you so early in the morning, but we think we may have developed a significant lead in your case, and I was wondering if I might be able to persuade you to let us pull the police presence in front of your building for several nights in hopes of drawing the suspect out.
obviously, we would install other safety measures.
last night was the first good night's sleep i've had in months.
I can't tell you what it was like to get into bed and know I was alone.
know I was alone.
Hey, where you going? -I got to call Scanlon.
Yeah. -He's in the apartment.
I don't know how he got in there, but...
are you talking about Kathleen Walsh's place?
I got a cop and a cop car sitting in front of her building, trust me.
I'm telling you, he can get past them.
we changed the locks on every door, and checked the latches on all her windows.
it doesn't matter.
Allison, what you're saying doesn't make any sense.
please! You have a man right there. Can't you send him up?
it's 2: 00 in the morning, Allison.
all right, I'll send someone up there. I'll call you right back.
I'm not sure how I feel about you calling strange men at 2: 00 in the morning.
I'm worried, Joe. I got a bad feeling.
that's good enough for me.
you were right about Edrick, by the way.
what do you mean? Did he fall to his knees, beg for mercy?
pretty damn close.
two officers went up, Allison. They checked the whole place.
no one was in there, and no one was getting in there,
I mean, except for one fairly cheesed-off blind lady, who said she was enjoying the best night's sleep she'd had in months.
Really?
but I don't understand.
no offense, Allison, but it's 2: 00 in the morning.
you, me, and Devalos are supposed to meet at 8: 00 A. M.
would it be okay if we chatted then?
sure.
now you're suggesting we use this woman as bait?
well, we know he likes Kathleen, so maybe we could remove some of the visible police presence around the building, the car sitting there, the patrolman?
okay...
what do you want me to say?
well, I don't know. Last night, I convinced myself that you thought it was a good idea.
well... I don't know what to tell you.
Allison, be realistic.
after you convinced detective scanlon to send the police charging into this woman's apartment at 2: 00 in the morning, the other tenants in the building, who are already up in arms about being stopped every time they come in and go out, have had it up to here.
not to mention what it's costing the department keeping personnel there 24-7.
I think we have to pull the plug on this thing.
but, sir, that man was there! I saw him
we were here having a meeting like this...
I have enormous respect for you, but it's 8: 10, and I'm due in the judge's chambers in 20 minutes.
last night, you said it was 8: 11.
last night? What are you talking about?
Hey, I need to use your phone.
hello.
Kathleen, it's Allison.
are you standing in your kitchen wearing your bathrobe holding a cup of hot coffee?
well, no.
now I'm making my way into the living room, wearing my bathrobe, holding a cup of hot coffee.
Kathleen, I need you to stay calm and do exactly as I say.
take that hot coffee you're holding and throw it over your right shoulder.
this is detective Scanlon. I need you to get up there now. Enter Kathleen Walsh's apartment, weapons drawn.
Kathleen, do it now-- he's right behind you!
mom, don't be ridiculous.
No!
police! Release that woman, and put your hands in the air!
we got him, then you're right.
I want to thank you for your bravery.
and I would also like to apologize for the initial skepticism that came from this office.
apology accepted.
turns out your tormentor was also your neighbor.
it seems your apartment and his were originally designed as a single unit.
Mr. Christopher Russo and his mother lived there until the early '90s, when his mother passed on, and he decided to turn it into two apartments.
your living room closet shares a common wall with one in his bedroom.
he finally confessed to everything last night from his hospital bed.
he hired Amanda Crane five years ago.
when she told him that the arrangement no longer worked for her, he told her he had pictures of her.
she threatened to call the police. They fought; he strangled her.
he claims to have been so horrified by the act of killing amanda, that he completely swore off having anything to do with the opposite sex.
started renting the apartment and completely forgot about the common closet.
then, you came along, a beautiful tenant with a built-in blindfold, and his old compulsions just took over.
well, I'm just happy to know he's behind bars.
which reminds me, there is someone who would very much like to meet you.
this is Sam Elkin.
it's very nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, Sam.
I've never slept with an executive senior vice president before.
five extra vacation days a year.
very impressive.
so what did Edrick have to say about it?
he was upset, but i explained to him, with age comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom.
and what comes with wisdom?
with any luck...
boxers!
not one step further.
the keeper of the Imperial Seal.
just the man I was looking for.
a woman.
you Chinese are very progressive.
a gift from an old friend.
he wanted me to send his regards.
father!
father.
the seal. You must get it back.
I promise.
give this...to your brother.
what are you reading?
Oh. Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy.
it's incredible.
Roy's just taken out the Mummy's entire army of zombie confederate soldiers, and he only had one bullet.
that's impossible.
Oh, no, it's not.
Roy figured out the physics of the canyon and then ricocheted a bullet off the canyon wall.
nailed each zombie through the heart.
what about the Shanghai Kid?
he was captured and knocked out on page 10
while he was polishing Roy's pearl handles.
don't you worry.
Roy's about to save him from becoming a human sacrifice.
those stories are all lies.
no. See?
it says right here on the back.
author Sage McCallister bases all his stories on firsthand accounts.
sorry, sheriff. No princess.
every day you meet the noon stage.
every day it's the same story.
she's not coming back.
pei Pei's married to her work in San Francisco.
modern woman.
sheriff, you got a parcel.
Hey, maybe it's from her!
no. It's from my sister in China.
I know.
I know. I must go.
stay here and be a good horsey for the new sheriff.
uh, sheriff, that stage is headed east.
isn't China kind of west of here?
I'm not going to China. I'm going to New York.
Roy invested my money.
is it true that he lives in a penthouse at the top of the Ritz surrounded by dozens of beautiful women
that's the old Roy.
he's married, settled down.
trust me, he's changed.
so there we were. Completely outnumbered.
he didn't have to tell me we didn't stand a chance.
so I send the Shanghai Kid and the princess out the back.
poor Shanghai Kid. He was so frightened.
he forgot to thank me for saving his life.
I'm used to that.
now, I returned to the front, and I counted to three...
and I burst out of the mission.
pearl handles blazing. Lead flying everywhere.
and not a single bullet touched me.
No! -Yeah.
what happened to the emperor's gold?
well, we divided it up.
I insisted on giving my share to the lndians.
the savages?
please don't ever call those noble people savages.
if being proud of your body and wanting to ride around naked all day makes you a savage, then, by God, you're drinking with a savage.
and that is what you call a French toast.
you are so sophisticated, Mr. O'Bannon.
Whoo!
who's up for some more bubbly?
reach for the sky, Roy.
say that again.
reach for the sky, Roy.
you sly son of a gun!
look at you! -Look at you!
what brings you to New York? -My share of the gold.
refresh my memory. What gold?
the emperor's gold.
okay, now, that gold is in what the Wall Street pros call a long-term investment.
we can't touch it because it's building.
I need it tonight.
you just got here. Let's celebrate.
no. I don't have time.
you just got to the big city. -My father's been killed.
Chon, I'm...
you need the money to get back for the funeral?
no. I must go to England. The ship leaves tonight.
your father died in England?
china. My sister followed the murderer to London.
wait. Murderer. I'm a little bit mixed up.
let me see if I can get the facts straight.
you have a sister? You never told me you had a sister.
is she pretty or does she look like you? Be honest.
Roy, I need my money!
I don't like that tone of voice.
you think after all we've been through I'd stiff you?
I'm doing pretty well for myself.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Roy. -That's okay.
you're going through a really tough time right now.
you got to be more trusting of people, okay?
look at me. It's Roy.
the couple at table 5 is ready to order.
do you work here?
no, I don't work here.
it looks like these guys are wearing a similar jacket.
Roy, here's your cut of the tips.
it's the craziest thing.
I guess because I come in here so much they're mistaking me for a waiter.
it's embarrassing. -You lost the gold.
not all of it. -Where's the rest?
I have one word for you. Zeppelin.
I need my money now!
easy, easy. -[ Woman laughing ]
will you do anything for this money?
Yes. I must leave tonight.
okay. Take this key.
go to the room. Get cleaned up.
your old pal Roy's got a plan.
go! Come on!
howdy, big boy.
what?
there's a woman in there! She wants me to sleep with her.
of course she does.
I told her the Great Wall ain't the only big thing coming out of China.
I will not sleep with women for money!
Why?
I'm gonna sleep with her for money.
Chon, just go in there and do your business and think about your sister in England.
what? -Roy!
duty calls. -Roy!
good evening, Mr. Mayor.
where are they?
who?
my daughters.
10th floor.
Roy? Roy, you got trouble.
I got to check on something. I'll be right back.
Chon, new plan. We got to go.
Chon, what are you doing?! -[ Woman moans ]
I'm fixing her back.
put her down, you decadent Philistine.
Hey, Chon, come on! Let's go!
Bye-bye. -Bye.
come on!
I don't understand. What's going on?
I don't have time to explain.
all you have to know is there are bad men after us...
but I'm in the right.
Roy. -You gotta trust me on this.
okay, look.
I'm in a transitional phase in my life.
but... -But what?
you want to know the truth?
I'm a little lost right now.
I see you. You've got a sense of purpose.
but look at me. I'm a 30-year-old waiter/gigolo.
Where's the future in that?
so what's the plan?
you were always my compass, Chon.
the plan. You ask me the right questions.
the plan?
the plan, I think, is to find the right woman.
raise a lot of children and teach them values.
no, Roy. The plan to get out of here.
okay, the plan. Here we go.
cops! Cops! -They can help us.
no, no. Chon, not these cops.
these are dirty cops. They take advantage of people.
now, if they stop us, remember, I'm not Roy O'Bannon.
who are you?
I'm your friend Smoky Desperado from the West.
and who am l?
you. You're Benihana.
Benihana. -Yeah.
you teach crippled children yoga here in the city.
you go first. -No! Why me?
because you blend in, okay?
now, go! Don't let them see you!
Hey! Hey!
Ooh.
Psst! Chon!
come on. Stop wasting time.
you!
Chon, I found our ticket out of here.
we're on our way.
looks like old Roy came through again.
just like old times, Chon.
check over there!
over to the alley! -That way!
Yeah, just like old times.
will you forget about the gold for a second?
you're gonna have more money than you ever dreamed of when that first zeppelin takes off.
why do I always believe you?
what do you mean?
you're lucky I didn't invest in that ridiculous automobile idea.
Yeah, that's gonna make a lot of money.
what's that?
doghouse. I'm in the doghouse.
Oh, come on, Chon.
look, I'm sorry I lied.
I just didn't want to disappoint you.
that's exactly what I mean.
I can't take that look.
I learned it from my father.
that's how he used to look at me.
what did your dad do? Was he an lmperial Guard?
no.
much more important.
he was the keeper of the lmperial Seal.
that's what I love about China.
everybody's job description sounds so damn cool.
the seal has been symbol of the emperor's power since Genghis Khan.
it has been passed down from one emperor to another.
my family have been watching over it for 12 generations.
12 generations?
my father and I used to skip stones across the moat and talk about a day I would follow his footsteps.
I was his only son.
if I'd have been there, I could have protected him.
it's not your fault. You were 3, 000 miles away.
what's with that little box?
my sister sent it to me from my father.
there's a message inside. -What's it say?
it's a puzzle box. I don't know how to open yet.
what do you mean?
get a hammer and smash it open so you can see what it says.
I must have patience.
by the time I'm able to open it...
I will be ready to read the message.
come on, Confucius.
that's the corniest thing I've ever heard.
let me see this.
you know what?
we're gonna go to England.
we're gonna find your dad's killer.
we're gonna get that seal back.
there's no reward for this, Roy.
who said anything about a reward?
I'm talking about friendship, loyalty, honor.
okay?
thank you, Roy.
and I hear England is ass soup.
a lot of pretty girls there.
first order of business, my Lordsï¼Œis a report from our esteemed friend Lord Rathbone...
who recently returned from a diplomatic mission to China.
fellow Lords...
I'm afraid I bring disturbing news from the Orient.
the opium wars have ravaged the land.
the emperor's enemies are organizing.
the most vicious are the Boxers.
a godless band of rebels who murder without discretion.
china is not well.
I have brought back an envoy who should give us some insight into the inscrutable mind of the Chinese.
is he mad?
given to Her Majesty Queen Victoria by the emperor in recognition of her 50 glorious years on the throne.
Outrageousness!
long live the queen.
boy: Jack the Ripper strikes again!
Extra! Extra! Read all about it.
howdy, partner.
the English are not very friendly.
they're just sore losers.
what did they lose?
a little thing called the American Revolution, Chon.
never heard of it.
I'll give you the highlights.
they came over with about a million men.
we had a bunch of farmers with pitchforks and beat 'em like a drum.
Hey! I'm walking here!
you're driving on the wrong side of the road!
bunch of amateurs. These people don't get it.
Hello, ladies.
look at you.
what? I'm not supposed to notice a pretty lady?
I thought you wanted to settle down and have a family.
I do, Chon. I just hope I can.
why not?
sometimes I worry that all the damn horseback riding I did out in the West, bouncing up and down on the hard saddles might have made it so my salmon don't swim upstream the way they're supposed to.
what?
I might be shooting blanks.
Oh.
don't say anything.
Roy, it's okay.
some people are not meant to have a family.
I've always had such a special connection with children.
Hey, watch it, you little punk!
pardon me, guv.
you gents lost your way?
Yeah. We're looking for my sister.
she's staying at 32 Oxford Street.
I know it well, guv. Me old man used to live there.
can you show us the way?
well, memory's a little dodgy.
but I'm sure for a bob I could get you there.
what do you take us for? Okies from Muskogee?
go sell your bullshit someplace else.
we're not buying.
thanks for the tip, guv.
Hey! I stole that watch from my uncle!
what?
this way.
come here, you little rubbish eater!
what did I tell you about poaching on our turf, Charlie?
I'm on the straight and narrow. Honest.
what's this, then?
after I'm through beating you...
you're gonna wish you never ran away from the workhouse!
leave the boy alone.
bloody tourists! Get your noses out of it!
do whatever you want to the kid...
but that's my watch.
well, there's a load of us and only two of you.
so piss off!
easy, fellas. You've lost one war this way.
don't make the same mistake twice.
come on! After him!
Hey!
there he is! Get him!
we've got him now. Move in, lads.
boys, boys, wait, wait!
come on! Get him!
up the bloody ladder!
Hey! Hey!
Oh! Watch it!
Hey.
Ah!
come here, you!
cool.
move it!
you!
did you see that?
it's okay.
okay?!
I call that one my kung pao chicken.
I clotheslined the sucker.
come on, get back!
make way!
I think you gentlemen should accompany me back to the yard.
this isn't a yard! It's a jail!
Roy, calm down.
unbelievable.
wait! Someone's coming!
let me handle this. -I'm gonna handle it.
the English aren't like you.
they don't get all emotional. Touchy-feely.
do me a favor.
park the Kung Fu. Let me do the talking.
come here. Let me give you a hug.
Ooh! [ Laughs ]
I've been after that Fleet Street gang for two years.
then you two come along and bring them down in a single afternoon. Brilliant!
now, um...
Oh, that's my watch!
Yes. A street urchin turned it in.
the little punk better not have scuffed it.
I hope your luck picks up. -What do you mean?
I deduced from your watch that you'd hit a rough patch.
he has. How do you know?
it's an investigative technique I've developed.
I can deduce intimate details about an individual through a close scrutiny of their personal effects.
what else can you tell?
the owner of this watch is a bad gambler and a lousy shot.
although he's cheated death several times...
he spends most of his life wandering in a rather pathetic and futile search for purpose and respect.
Oh, yes.
he has a penchant for loose women.
Wow. That's amazing.
I'm sure it's a very popular party trick at birthdays for small children...
but it doesn't quite play with adults.
just to set the record straight.
Roy O'Bannon is not attracted to loose women.
loose women are attracted to me.
you're Roy O'Bannon? -Yeah.
the famous Western folk hero?
have you heard of me?
have I heard of you?
I've only read "Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy" five times.
it's fascinating.
I want you to meet the Shanghai Kid.
Oh, yes.
the faithful Chinese sidekick.
I'm not a sidekick. Those stories are all lies.
come on, don't be bitter.
I can't help what Sage McCallister writes.
if there's anything I can do, I'm at your service.
we're looking for my sister. She's staying at this address.
can you take us there?
Oh, dear.
I think you'd better come with me.
if you don't mind, I'll just wait outside.
[ clears throat ] lntroduce me.
Oh. This is Lin, my baby sister.
Roy O'Bannon.
pleasure.
you never told me your sister was such a...
beautiful lotus blossom.
What'd she say?
no, no, no.
no talking about me in your native tongue.
why are you in jail?
I followed the man who murdered Father.
And?
I found out where he live.
I snuck inside his house and tried to kill him.
it's my duty to find Father's killer.
no, it is mine! I'm the one who promised Father.
but I'm his only son.
when you abandoned us for America...
father said he had no son.
what?
whoa. Time out.
time out. Come here.
the detective's a fan.
why don't I play the celebrity card?
we'll get her out that way.
okay? -Okay.
don't worry. I'll get you out.
everything's gonna be okay.
in fact, I'm gonna give you my good-luck playing cards.
just ignore the naked ladies.
have you opened Father's box?
not yet.
she tried to assassinate Lord Rathbone whilst he was taking afternoon tea.
he's 10th in line to the throne...
her Majesty's favorite cousin...
and the finest swordsman in England.
so, of course, the press had a field day.
the story actually knocked Jack the Ripper off the front page.
Artie, Lin is not a killer.
she's just a really, really, really hot...
confused Chinese girl.
maybe if I agreed to sign a few autographs and talk to some of my fans here in England...
do some type of charity event, can we get her out that way?
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
what will happen to my sister?
she'll go to trial, probably be locked away in an institution for the criminally insane.
the tabloids have already dubbed her "Loony Lin " .
I thought it was rather catchy.
at the time.
do you have any notion what would happen if we were to be seen together?
since your return, I have yet to lay eyes on the lmperial Seal.
I'm hosting a jubilee ball at my country estate tomorrow.
be at the stables at midnight.
as requested, a token of my esteem.
this is where you get out.
I hope there will be more trust between us when I'm emperor and you are the new king.
Wow. Buckingham Palace. Look at that, Chon.
that's where the queen lives.
Hey, look at this guy.
he's a royal guard. He has a very important job.
I used to be just like him.
no, they're nothing like you.
they're a tourist attraction.
you can make faces at them, insult them...
and they can't move a muscle.
here. Watch this. -Roy...
no, it's okay.
Hey, buddy, your shoes are untied.
that is the biggest damn beaver I have ever seen.
Roy, stop it.
the queen!
look! The queen!
she's mooning us!
he almost went for that.
my friend and I just came over from America.
you might have heard of it. We run your jerkwater country.
come on, you gonna take that from a colonial?
Roy, stop it.
I bet you are one hell of a damn poker player.
no hard feelings.
huh?
they can't do that!
you're not allowed to do that!
shouldn't have touched him.
you scram, you little punk.
I've got friends at Scotland Yard.
I'll give you up in a heartbeat.
you get your watch back?
don't worry about my watch. Go on.
it's a knockoff.
what are you talking about?
my uncle stole this watch from President Lincoln.
it's a priceless family heirloom.
not according to the pawnbroker.
you should not steal.
if I don't steal, I don't eat.
who showed you how to do all that kicking and punching?
my father.
have you ever heard of those? They're parents.
you don't 'cause you're a little orphan.
now, go on. You're cramping our style.
Oh, this country blows.
you need a place to stay?
come on in and warm your dogs.
[ whistles ] You can get into a lot of trouble breaking into a place like this.
that being said, well done.
you just ate the last chocolate.
course I did.
you gotta look out for number one.
I could really get used to this.
living the life of a country gentleman.
maybe doing a little painting.
let Lin play in the garden with the children.
Vera, Chuck, and Dave.
who's Lin?
lin's the most beautiful woman I've ever met.
she's gonna be the savior of the house of O'Bannon.
Chon, check out the threads.
all I'm missing is the loyal hound curled at my feet.
we are wasting time. We must find Rathbone.
what do you think I've been doing?
sitting here drinking expensive hooch?
refill.
I've been working on a plan.
now -- Whoa. Don't slosh the brandy.
lt messes with the bouquet. -Sod off.
I'm trying to teach you a skill set.
help get you off the street.
bartenders make big bucks. -Roy!
the plan.
thank you, Chon.
if we find the seal...
we can prove Rathbone killed your dad.
it's the old Hail Mary play.
I also have a version where we dig a tunnel.
Hey!
bloody catapult. Jesus Christ!
you don't need a catapult! -Who asked you?
you don't interrupt grown-ups when they're talking.
lord Nelson Rathbone requests the pleasure of your company at the jubilee ball in honor of Her Majesty's 50th year on the throne.
sounds good.
it doesn't address security.
they're not gonna let Chon and l waltz into the castle.
all you need is a proper disguise.
I do like a good disguise.
I look like a fool.
What?! You're a maharaja. That's lndian royalty.
but I'm Chinese. -It's the same thing.
Bob your head a little bit.
gives you more of a lndia-royalty flavor.
that's good. Good show, good show.
good show, good show.
cheerio, cheerio. -Cheerio, cheerio.
what do we do when we see Rathbone?
kill him.
no, okay? No!
you're gonna be civil, cause we don't have the seal.
no seal. No Lin. No family honor. Okay?
be cool. Okay, we look great.
let's enjoy this party.
whoa. What are you doing? -I'm going inside.
the place is haunted. -You're the harness man.
you get back at the carriage.
you wait in case we need to make a quick getaway.
go on. Man your post.
you don't always get what you want.
why are you so mean to that boy?
I see a lot of myself in that kid.
it's kind of freaking me out. Come on.
your name, please, sir.
so I can announce you.
Sherlock...Holmes.
which province do you represent, Your Highness?
may I present Major General Sherlock Holmes and His Highness, the maharaja of Nevada.
how are the security arrangements?
Oh, everything seems to be going swimmingly, my Lord.
and if I may say so...
it is an honor to guard Your Lordship tonight.
I speak for all of us at Scotland Yard when I say that no matter how far you are from the throne...
you'll always be number one in our hearts.
okay, here's the plan.
we're gonna get a little chow.
then we're gonna sneak out of here.
start looking for that seal. -Okay.
spotted Dick, sir? -What?
spotted Dick.
can you believe this guy?
I'm trying to get something to eat.
he's asking me if I got the clap.
I think he's offering you food.
Oh. Spotted Dick.
Oh, no. I think I'll pass.
I'm not really a dessert man.
perhaps my friend might like some Spotted Dick.
I might try one of these sausages.
a little smoky Joe.
Mmm! This is good!
I thought the food here was supposed to suck.
the haggis is fresh from Scotland, sir.
it's made from the finest sheeps' bladders.
I'm gonna get some whiskey and wash my mouth out.
you should try the quail.
I shot them myself this morning.
how do you do, Your Lordship?
very well, thank you.
I'm not acquainted with the Nevada province.
but I haven't been to lndia since 81.
I spent most of my time in the Orient.
I hear you've just returned from China.
you are well-informed, Maharaja.
it is my dream that the Chinese people will follow lndia's example and one day embrace British rule.
the Chinese are very proud.
they place family and honor above all else.
well, I'm sure we can break them of that.
if you'll excuse me, I have a matter to attend to.
until we meet again.
patience. I'm proud of you, Chon.
we must find the seal.
what do you see?
shh, shh, shh!
he just pulled a fancy dragon key out of his desk.
that was my father's!
I must avenge his honor.
Hey, slow down, tiger. Slow down.
quit going all Chinese on me.
where is he?
damn it. Remember your puzzle box. Patience.
okay, there are no windows.
we just came in through the only doorway.
that leaves one explanation.
remember in "Roy O'Bannon vs. The Mummy
how the zombie king got away when I chased him into the pharaoh's tomb?
there's a secret passageway behind the sphinx.
there's gotta be a lever or a button over here.
help me lift some stuff up.
the painting. It's looking at me.
look! -Oh, yeah.
looks like it's looking at me. That's great.
no, real eyes. Moving!
that kid got to you, didn't he?
unbelievable! We're not in a haunted house.
that's a technique that an artist uses.
'Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant eyes" is the technical term.
it's unnerving, though. I'll give you that.
Roy. Now, those eyes. Look!
whatever you say, Chon.
let's see what you got here, Rathbone.
what, Chon? Are the statues moving now?
Wow.
Mm-mmm!
I can't hear myself think with you shouting at me.
this is ridiculous.
if you want to act like a child and play games...
then find someone else...
cause I take this stuff seriously.
I'm here to work. I'm on a mission.
okay, Chon.
okay, you little Chinese otter.
let's play.
ha!
Chon, demons!
she's gonna fight my battles for me.
come on. Let's go.
what? What are you doing?
it's kinky. I like it.
Wow! Look at this.
wait. There's something different about this room.
have a seat.
how's the arm?
fractured in two places.
Gil, Conrad again.
um... Message number three.
call me back please.
it's feeling better? - Yeah.
good.
so, you must know where he is.
actually, I don't.
Really?
okay, um...
look, I don't want to play any games here.
this is as difficult for me as it is for you.
so let's just, uh, get this over with, shall we?
okay then, uh, this is an administrative inquiry.
you and your supervisor were in direct violation of lab policy...
are.
are in direct violation of lab policy which states that members of the same forensic team may not engage in a romantic relationship.
so when did you and supervisor Grissom begin your relationship?
we've always had a relationship.
I mean when did you become intimate?
two years ago.
I think it was a Sunday.
sagebrush valley high school.
the cobras.
he looks like he could still be in high school.
boy, football's gotten a lot more brutal since my playing days.
Yeah, where's the rest of him, still on the field?
there's no high school football fields around here anyway.
what do you think, Grissom?
Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.
blood pool tells me the helmet must've been here for a while.
vehicle tire rolled through it.
helmet has black abrasions on it consistent with being hit by a tire.
probably got pinballed down the road.
I checked with traffic.
no reports of any traffic accidents near here.
uh, Holstein's getting an absentee list from the high school.
head's over there.
blood trail leads up from here.
we follow the blood.
he say anything about what's happening with Sara?
no.
Hey, did Sara ever say anything to you about her and Grissom?
not in so many words.
so you knew about the two of them?
Yeah.
Hey!
Where's the uniform?
if he's not a player, what's with the helmet?
maybe he's a rabid fan.
there were all kinds of high school games last night.
Where's his hand?
got to be around here somewhere.
the hand-- where did you find it?
20 yards away, two hours later.
David, he doesn't look prepped.
what's taking so long?
I can't get the helmet off.
I better get this ten-card to mandy right away.
hold it.
his face looks like hamburger.
I found the same blck powder on his clothes.
Hey, mandy.
I got a ten-card on our john doe.
well, let's see if it matches the safe-kit that Holstein brought in.
only have one more kid unaccounted for at that high school.
Hey, if you had a kid, would you collect a safe-kit on them?
why not?
it's better to be prepared.
think of it as a cheap insurance policy.
it's just a print card, a cheek swab and a photo.
then go to bed every night hoping you don't have to use it.
well, there's a match.
your john doe is Vincent Bartley. - Yeah?
Yeah.
okay, good.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
well, nothing.
I mean, it was dark. - It was really dark.
one minute we're married, and the next...
you know what? Good for you.
divorces should be like band-aids, one quick yank and done.
you think?
Oh, what do I know?
Eddie and I stayed together way too long.
every decision was an act of congress.
it's the end of an era, ladies and gentlemen.
Hampton huxley, publisher of hux magazine -
where boys became men, and men became more manly-- has died.
that magazine got me through vietnam.
Oh, that would explains the lookers out front.
they were kitties.
Yes, kitties, indeed.
he was dining with a couple of them when he bought the farm.
miss summer and miss winter, I believe.
every male in the phillips family gets a lifetime subscription to hux for his bar mitzvah.
I guess my sons will have to settle for a cross pen.
I'm sure the magazine will go on without him, Dave.
what are we looking at?
puncture wound.
no abrasion ring.
but I can reapproximate the skin.
so it's probably not a gunshot.
stabbing?
maybe.
right through the temple, into the brain.
be lights out in seconds.
it's a crowded restaurant.
somebody must have seen something.
not exactly.
welcome to the latest fad.
dining in the dark.
waiters are blind.
no one sees anything.
piece of cake, huh?
dining should be an experience, like opera or art.
it should feed the soul as well as the belly.
you should smell it, touch it and let it rest on your tongue.
I'm selling sensuality here.
I encourage eating with your hands.
texture is crucial.
the salty, meaty flesh of lobster drenched in creamy, clarified french butter.
the pulpy seeded flesh, and firm skin of a fresh fig dipped in honey.
the tongue understands four major taste groups
salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and has over 10, 000 taste buds, each with a direct connection to the pleasure center of the brain, triggering endorphins.
the anticipation and the release of eating good food is chemically quite similar to getting high on drugs.
and apparently just as dangerous.
so tell me what happened.
I don't know.
each one of the waiters has one of those clickers.
if there's an emergency, the houselights come up and a red light goes off in the kitchen.
are you okay?
call 9-1-1.
Oh, so you didn't see anything?
I'm in the kitchen.
I have two sittings a night, at 7: 00 and 10: 00, average 25 heads, ten courses per.
I have no time to pee.
april was here...
and huxley was here.
okay.
got blood on the chair.
blood on the tablecloth.
blood drops on the floor, leading away from hux's chair.
stab him. Extract the weapon.
drip, drip, drip.
and they end here.
near Ms. Shasta.
Shasta mccloud-- big "m," little "c," big "c," plus "loud."
on TV, they never show anyone bleeding from a heart attack.
is that what you think happened?
well, yeah. I mean, all that prevalis and diet soda.
I just figured...
april, shh!
he was an animal until the day he died, sir.
wait a minute.
what did happen?
Well-well, you're the one with blood on you.
maybe you can tell me.
I thought he just fell asleep like he always does at the end of meals.
come on!
wake up, Huxey.
wake up, Huxey.
wake up, Huxey-hux.
come on, it's time to go.
meow, meow!
meow, meow!
waiter! Emergency!
April? April, what's wrong?! - Call 9-1-1! Help!
April! April! - Michael here.
code red!
help!
help us!
okay. Um, look, I'm going to need to take your sweater.
Yeah, like I haven't heard that one before.
no. No, I don't mean right now.
no, I mean, I...I'll need to take it before I go.
you know, later, when I, when I leave, I have to take your sweater then.
Mr. Bartley?
Matt.
I'm Vincent's brother.
I'm...Nick. Stokes.
you don't need to say it.
I knew when the detective asked me for that safe-kit that it was going to be Vinnie.
shouldn't I be talking to your parents?
don't have any parents.
mom skipped out when we were little, and dad died a couple years ago.
it's just the two of us.
your brother wasn't on the football team, but when we found him, he was wearing a football helmet.
why is that?
it was my old helmet.
is that how you got injured?
no.
it was the last day of spring break, and...
I was wasted.
like a dumb-ass, I dove into the tangiers wave pool headfirst.
fractured my T-1 vertebra.
so why the helmet?
well, I was a pretty good football player.
he was proud of that.
that and my dad's dragon belt.
he got it when he was in the service.
Vinnie wears it every day.
it's just something that he has to hold onto...to deal with.
Yeah.
you know, one of these could've been the murder weapon.
it's approximate in size and shape.
and everybody had one.
well, something dripped over here that is not blood.
well, could've been whatever food was on the skewers.
als will pick up anything that's fatty or dairy-based.
could you turn off the lights for a second?
I'm sorry, but this is a stupid idea for a restaurant.
I need to see what I'm eating.
I can see just fine.
where are you?
Hi. - Hi.
night vision goggles?
Yeah, someone left these behind.
kind of defeats the purpose of dining in the dark.
unless you don't come here for the food.
Mr. Nivens.
are these yours?
I'll take that as a "yes.
wait, wait...I didn't kill anyone.
then why would your bring military-grade, night vision goggles to the restaurant?
a hunch.
sweetheart, you want to try some of my steak?
no, thanks.
I'm all good.
always be suspicious when your wife wants to dine in the dark with another couple.
you brought night vision goggles to spy on me during dinner?
damn right.
millions of tires wear out ever year.
you ever wonder where all that rubber dust goes?
no, I don't.
the black powder trace you found in your victim's clothing was tire rubber.
it's not surprising. We found the body on the side of the highway.
of course you would expect that.
however, I did find some very interesting type of rubber.
okay, Hodges, dazzle me.
truck tires have 27% isoprene and 14% neoprene.
that's what makes them so hard.
passenger tires have a lower isoprene-to-neoprene ratio, but they also have silica for fuel economy and wet traction.
go-cart tires, or "slicks," to those in the know, have much higher levels of carbon black and oil, resulting in extremely high traction.
guess I better get my go-cart on.
you know, just so you know, I'm a bit of go-cart enthusiast myself.
Oh, uh...that's awesome.
have you seen this guy before?
day before yesterday.
day before that, and the day before that.
Oh, man, did he get in trouble?
are these the race stats?
you keep record of them?
Yeah, all in here.
people ask for them every day like they're some sort of trophy.
could you print out vincent bartley's trophy from the last time he was here?
Yeah. But I'm not getting him in trouble, am I?
no. No, not really.
you know, when I was a kid, we used to make these things out of lunch trays and old lawn mower engines.
when I was kid, I used to make bombs, little bombs.
Oh."Vinnie Vroom."
won all three of his races.
beat out a guy named "Hot Rod."
Vinnie ran circles around him.
Yes. Yes.
Yes, is that all you got?
is that all you got?
Rodney went from being a-rod to being no-rod.
Hey, there he is, right there.
Aw, come on.
Hey, if you guys want to race, then you guys have to wear dresses, huh?
get your skill up, all right.
I need some competition here.
hot Rod!
get out of the truck!
get out of the truck now!
get out of the truck now!
nothing says "I'm guilty" like running from the cops, dumb-ass.
give me his wallet.
we're with the vegas crime lab, Mr. Banks.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.
you got quite a mess here, Rod.
mind if I take a look?
Where'd you get that belt?
I don't know. - Where?
I don't know.
blood.
looks like things just got a lot hotter for you, Rod.
all skewers accounted for, none of them bloody.
we've got a high-profile dead guy in a locked-room situation, with 16 diners and three blind waiters.
give me something.
how about a band-aid with petals?
it's not a band-aid.
it's a nipple flower.
what's it doing at a table with four guys?
can I go to the bathroom? Please, please, please?!
again? - Yes, sir.
okay. What's so funny?
we slipped a laxative in his beer in the dark.
it's his sixth trip to the can.
it's freakin' hilarious.
what are you guys, like 12 years old?
Oh, hey, hey, curly.
how come you're so pretty in pink?
breast exam.
you know doctors without boundaries, if you know what I mean.
you guys, come here.
it's total darkness.
there's two kitties. That's four...
they're all up for grabs!
I'm going on a mission of mercy.
who is that?
stop it.
save it for later.
what are you talking about?
that's not you, Hux?
somebody's touching me!
sweet mother.
guys, they're real-- both of them!
waiter? Waiter, we have a problem over here.
Yeah, I lead Mr. Manducci back to his seat.
he and his brothers had had quite a bit to drink.
so it was the blind leading the drunk, huh?
I could do it with my eyes closed.
well, did you, did you hear anything unusual?
no. Everyone seemed to be having a good time.
until the woman in the fuzzy dress shrieked.
I found Mr. Huxley slumped forward.
checked for a pulse, and he didn't have one, so I turned on the emergency lights.
then she really screamed.
is she pretty?
she had a pretty girl scream.
Oh, man.
she's a huxley kitty.
she's gorgeous.
Hey, uh...
let me ask you something.
did you wash your hands?
force of habit; I'm sorry. Waiter.
okay, we're going to have to take your prints, okay?
sure.
we're going to walk, straight ahead.
looks like there was some kind of struggle.
sticky.
what do you think it is?
honey?
the detective needs to ask us some questions.
Hi, Nanci Katz.
soon to be Ellis.
I'm Jim Brass.
so, what happened, Nanci?
Oh, um...ask him.
Oh, uh, well, I-I thought it would be romantic...
I have not ever tasted a fig this juicy.
Oh, they're so good.
it's like they're, it's like, it's better than the newtons.
it's so much better.
Oh, god!
baby, are you okay?
Yeah, um...
what happened? - Yeah.
uh...a thing...I'm, uh, okay.
it's Michael here.
is everyone all right?
Oh, uh, yeah.
Michael, I'm just...
I'm trying to get something going here.
Oh, no problem, sir. I'll leave you two alone.
okay.
uh, baby, where's your...
ever since I met you, i've known I wanted to ask you this question.
would you be my wife?
will you marry me?
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
I can't even see it, but it feels big.
the ring, I mean.
sure, yeah.
Congratulations.
so how'd you bump your noggin?
it was dark; nobody, could see.
I wanted to say yes.
loud and clear.
there's a lot of metal under those tables.
there really is, yeah.
way too much.
it's not safe.
I bet.
losing the race was just the beginning.
then, you killed him, cut his body up.
and dumped it on the side of the road.
whoa, man.
I swear I didn't kill anybody.
or I didn't cut anybody up or dump 'em.
all I did was ask him for a rematch...
off the track, where it really counts.
so your statement is he just spontaneously lost his head?
Yeah.
you know, one minute, he's staring at me.
the next, I look back, and the headless horseman is driving his cart.
and then what happened?
so why you just didn't ditch the carts?
Christin, that...
that girl at the track, she let us sneak out with them.
you know, my life was turning into a horror movie -
I didn't want to bring her in on it.
you've been dodging me; it's time to talk.
Gil, nobody wants to hear about your love life less than I do,
but since you didn't handle this right, I have to take a formal statement.
should've been a conversation between friends.
I mean, we could've fnd some way around this.
Catherine could have done Sara's evaluations.
why didn't you just tell me?
we didn't want you to know.
don't most women like the world to know they're dating someone?
where do you get your information about women, Conrad?
okay, so, when did you two, you know?
nine years ago.
you know what?
you two need to get your stories straight.
there's road gravel embedded in all these tires.
Yeah, but no visible blood on that one.
got a worn area on this front bumper.
some brown trace.
same goes for the rear of that one.
well, if it turns out to be leather, it would confirm hot Rod's story that he towed the second cart back using Vinnie's belt.
got what looks like...blood on this wheel well.
this is the victim's cart.
must have been movin' when his head popped off.
well, another one for the scrapbk.
OO boy, he looks different without hair.
never knew he wore a toupee.
Oh, uh, it had something sticky on it, so I bagged it for trace.
but if you want, we could put it back on for the photo op.
no, that's okay; let's get to cutting.
embedded horizontally in the parenchyma of the right temporal lobe is a linear, silver-toned, metal tube that tapers to a point.
and in this case, David, the pen may be mightier than the sword.
okay.
okay, that pen's not mine.
Yeah. Nice try, sweetheart.
excuse me.
can I be lucy logic for a bit?
first of all, that purse is designer.
there's no way I'm ruining it with ink.
second of all, I know where my bread is buttered.
hux was my meal tick --kill him, go hungry.
unless you're in the will.
kitties don't get in the will.
besides, if I had touched that thing, wouldn't I have ink on my hands?
whoever did it ditched the pen in my bag.
it was on the back of my chair the whole time.
it could have been anyone.
what about the guy who assaulted me?
Shasta: Look, if you really want a suspect, you need to check out little miss chef lady.
little miss chef lady?
why is that? - Hello.
duh, she's... Winter issue?
1995.0
you certainly weren't hiding anything back then. Hmm?
ms. Sanchez, according to your fellow kitties, you and Huxley had a falling out.
it's curious that you didn't mention that.
I didn't mention it, because it's ancient history.
12 years ago, a misogynist told me I should eat less.
and today, I now have a hot restaurant on the strip and two contracts for spots in L. A.and chicago.
"food seduction" is a best-seller.
I think I won that battle already.
so, did you and Huxley speak to each other last night?
his reservation was booked under a pseudonym.
I didn't even know he was there.
Mr. Brass, do you know why I started my restaurant?
no. Tell me.
because I fell in love with a blind man.
he would turn off the lights and feed me.
when you deprive one sense, other senses are heightened.
my only focus was on my tongue.
it was brilliant.
and then he died.
and this restaurant is an homage to him.
to our love affair.
how nice for you.
I don't mean to be crude, but a murder is, quite frankly, bad for business.
Hey. - Hey.
so, huxley had honey on his hairpiece, ink in his brain and blood all over.
there were three people who had honey on their hands:
the frisky couple and Michael.
two people who had blood on their clothing: April and Michael.
and there was a total of five people moving around the room:
two Manducci brothers and all three waiters.
now, that's a lot of lists for Michael to turn up on.
he does work there, so there's reason for it, but...
well, there's no reason for this.
Michael's print in ink, on a napkin.
what would he have against Huxley?
his prints hit back to an old work card.
the guy used to be a chef.
a blind chef? - He lost his sight a few years back.
but before that, guess who was his sous-chef?
the man knew his way around a kitchen, "and his way into my heart."
michael would spend hours teaching me, feeding me... Loving me.
so, you're the dead guy?
she seduces me, steals my recipes, my ideas, my investors.
and then she hires me as a freaking waiter.
night after night, I listen to her tell stories of the tragic love affair, of the poor, dead blind guy.
last night, I finally confronted her.
I deserve a piece of the action.
at $200 a head, you're clearing at least $1, 000 in tips at night.
that's a lot of action for a blind man.
I made you.
you're fired. We're done.
but why kill Huxley? Why not just her?
I'm blind. She's not.
but in that dining room, everybody else is blind, too.
and when Huxley walked in with his kitties, it was like a sign from the gods.
I knew I could destroy her and the restaurant.
I waited till the oyster course.
the shells clanging, and slurping, the "oohing," the "aahing,
I knewt it would cover any noise I was going to make.
I wanted her rotting in jail, eating bologna sandwiches.
if you wanted to frame Pippa, why did you plant the pen in Shasta's purse?
I tell everyone to put their purses and jackets on the back of the chairs, so I knew exactly where her purse was.
old cat frames young kitty.
kind of perfect.
we found high velocity blood spatter inside the rear wheel well of the victim's cart, which means he lost his head at high speed.
so how did hot Rod decapitate Vinnie while racing down a highway at 60 miles an hour?
maybe he didn't.
well, people's heads just don't fly off for no reason.
maybe we should check the scene for some wires or branches, or something he could've run into.
if it would've happened that way, we would've found trace from whatever did it.
the only trace in the neck and arm wounds was rubber from truck tires.
which was present on both sides of his wounds but not on his clothing.
there were blown out tire fragments all over the road.
but we found his body off the road.
there shouldn't be any transfer from truck tires.
unless...
what's going on here?
we're trying to determine whether a steel-belted truck tire can decapitate a kid driving a go-cart.
I thought that was an urban myth.
myths, legends, tall tales-- they all come from something real.
if that go-cart was going 60 miles an hour drafting a truck going the same speed, and that truck blows a tire sending a two-pound projectile into the driver's neck...
the combined speed of impact would be 120 miles an hour.
which is about... 962 foot-pounds of energy.
all right, let's go, fellas.
come on, Conrad. There's always room for Jell-O.
it's expensive Jell-O.
I love this.
well, it worked.
see if we can't reuse some of that.
when did you tell ecklie we got involved?
two years ago.
Why? What did you tell him?
nine years ago.
the forensic academy conference?
Yeah.
you, uh, had too many questions about anthropology for some reason.
well, I was stalling.
I was trying to get the nerve to ask you to dinner.
you had a ponytail.
I'm going to move to swing.
we talked about this.
I know that you said that you would do it, but I don't want to do that to the team.
besides... I am sure that I could use more daylight in my life.
we should go.
Yeah.
you, uh, you want a ride?
wish I could.
what about you, Ricky Bobby?
no, thanks, I like to watch.
okay.
you should go. - Yeah?
Yeah, you should go.
okay.

Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
the Omen. A computer virus that can erase a hundred zetabytes of data per second.
it could take down the Internet, crash airplanes, and erase every database in the world.
in truth, Chuck, the virus is just a piece of the plan.
what happens now? - That's the real surprise, isn't it?
there. The Omen is officially unleashed upon the world.
Christmas cheer? Try Christmas fear.
a virus dubbed "The Omen" has infected computers worldwide.
and it has Christmas shoppers in a panic.
are their hard drives in danger of being erased?
or, is the virus a gag that does nothing?
why panic? Ask yourself: what would baby Jesus do?
and you are...? - I'm Michael Tucker, assistant manager of Burbank Buy More.
I want customers to remember the true meaning of Christmas, and get back to what you're supposed to be doing:
buying stuff. - Like this iPad! A bargain for $599.
honestly, it's overpriced. You can get all this stuff on the Internet.
see, everything is fine here at the Buy More. Totally fine!
no computer virus problems here.
dear God! Jeffrey! I need your help, buddy. These people are animals.
the virus is everywhere, and nobody knows how to stop it!
nobody knows how to stop it!
what is going on here?
authorities do not know who is responsible for the Omen virus, but assume it is an act of cyber-terrorism...
every prison cell in here is connected to the mainframe.
what if the Omen virus hits us?
you worry too much. Take another snort of almond-milk nog.
open
do you hear that?
Ellie. Relax.
we are so behind! We are so crazy behind, and I can't find it!
find what? - The star for the top of the Christmas tree, the one that Dad gave me.
deep breaths, Namaste style.
Devon, it's Christmas Eve, we are having a party in six hours, we don't have a tree, we don't have decorations...
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
what are you doing? - I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
saying your name aloud helps to calm you.
reminds you you're in control of your own actions.
I am Eleanor Woodcomb. - I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
Yeah, that didn't work. - Okay.
what are you freaking out about?
because Christmas was my first memory, okay?
the presents, the smell of fresh-baked cookies, and I know that Clara is a little young, but I thought that maybe it could be her first memory, too, and I just...
I want everything to be perfect.
all right. What's going to turn that frown upside down?
a real tree, lights, fake snow, and a picture of Clara on Santa's lap?
that's a tall order, babe. - I know.
but... that is why I recruited someone onto our team.
Ellie. - Sarah, I need an update.
it's okay. Project Santa is under control.
got the decorations from your list, you just need to get the tree and the snow.
Thanks. - Okay, bye.
Hey, Sarah.- Your sister is in full-blown Christmas mode.
well, it wouldn't be Christmas with the Bartowskis without a little bit of drama.
speaking of which... - No progress on the virus?
whoever's behind this is a ghost. Untraceable.
no. There is no such thing. They just haven't slipped up yet.
and when they do? Carmichael Industries will be there to take them down.
but for now, I promise nobody is going to ruin our Christmas.
just everyone else's.
Chuck, it's going to be okay.
look, I'm going to lock up Castle and come home.
Oh, by the way, will you tell Casey, uh...
Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear, has arrived.
Mr. Pippers? Really?
Oh, man, that's like our favorite childhood toy, right?
one of, yeah. - Top five. Maybe.
but still, our generation. Not really yours.
I got it on eBay.
Alex's mom said she used to run around with a little bear thing like that.
it's still in its original package.
I thought it was a good idea. Dumb, huh?
no. It's actually quite touching.
like you're feeling real human emotion.
don't you ever say that again. And don't you breathe a word of this to Alex.
no. No. My lips are... my lips are sealed.
Christmas presents are sacred in the Grimes family.
gentlemen. - General.
we have an emergency. We know who's behind this.
merry Christmas, Sarah.
miss me? - Not for a second.
that's no way to treat an old boyfriend.
just give up, Walker. You're no match for the Intersect.
comfy?
no?
good.
69% complete.
only a couple more hours before the virus activates.
what are you doing, Shaw?
you're the one behind the Omen? The plan?
surprise. - Why?
why stay in jail when I can break out, release the virus...
...and take over the CIA?
gave away my plan.
Sarah, thank God! Shaw broke out of prison, where are you?
Sarah? - Hello, nerd.
do me a favor?
turn on the monitor.
merry Christmas!
Hey, can I tell you a story? - You untie Sarah right now.
there's this tradition in Germany where Santa Claus or Krampus, as they call him visits all the naughty children on Christmas Eve.
but instead of giving them coal, he wakes them up, and the naughtiest of children never see Christmas Day.
let her go. - Or what?
no Sarah, no Intersect... You're worthless, Chuck.
I've put Castle on lockdown. Do everything I say.
or she dies.
get my drift? - Why are you doing this?
because you put me in jail? Because of our last fight, because you tried to kill me?
so much history, Chuck. It could be anything.
fine. What do you want? - The CIA base downtown.
break into Clyde Decker's office, retrieve the Macau device, and bring it to me.
what is it? What does it look like?
figure it out. You have three hours.
don't you hurt her.
impressed?
I implicated Chuck in a massive conspiracy, and captured his girl.
all from an 8x8 cell.
you... working with Clyde Decker? How?
decker was a slug.
he tried to interrogate me, and in one flash I knew all his filthy secrets.
a little blackmail, and his entire team was working for me.
you know what the best part is?
there's nothing that Chuck can do to stop me.
what now, Chuck?
Oh, boy.
this is bad. This is really bad. He is shutting down.
then we take care of Shaw ourselves.
Yeah, but he has the Intersect. I mean, we're going to need a plan, a really good plan.
I've got the plan.
Daniel Shaw murdered my father, and now he has my wife.
he's gonna wish he never left that prison cell.
that plan's kind of vague.
Morgan, I need you to reverse-engineer that virus. Use the nerds.
if they're focused, they're better than any computer expert in the CIA.
we need to figure out exactly what happens when that virus activates.
I'm on it.
Casey. Find alternate routes into Castle.
I need options in case I can't get the device that Shaw wants.
whoa, whoa, hold on. You're going to break into the CIA?
Decker's office is on level five. Omega level.
you go in alone, it's suicide.
who said anything about going in there alone?
the Macau device was stolen two months ago from a Chinese technology company.
it compresses huge quantities of data to fit onto a single computer hard drive.
why would Shaw want it?
I have no idea.
what's the best way for me to get into the CIA?
there's only one way in.
with me.
general, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that, but you realize you're putting yourself on the line here.
this is my team. And nobody, especially Shaw, is going to take us down.
I just got off the phone with Buy More Corporate.
they want to know everything there is to know about this Omen virus
what happens when it activates.
in order to stop it, we need to know its next move.
Fold.- I-no, no.
you guys are the only ones that understand C++ and a bunch of other computer languages, okay?
I need you to crack this thing, I need you to do it now.
Yeah. N.I. - What?
not interested. - Thank you.
it's an immature response, I know, but I, too, am underincentivized.
until this virus is cracked, nobody's buying any crap at the Buy More.
which means no double overtime and no Christmas bonus.
true. But it seems a little above and beyond our usual duties.
name your price. - I got this.
I would like a... six-inch Classic Italian BMT from Subway. Boom.
I was going to say a trip to the Bahamas.
subway. Done. I'll make it a footlong.
nice! Make mine flatbread, boys!
I'm going into Castle, in through the ducts.
all right. Hey, be careful.
it's a war zone.
some scrooge stole Christmas right out of the Buy More.
Mike, I'm really sorry to bother you. Maybe we should just forget it.
you kidding?
getting this angel her picture with Santa might be the only cheer I get to spread around here this year.
let Santa just grab his suit.
damn hell!
what kind of monster steals a Santa suit on Christmas Eve, but leaves the eyebrows?
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
babe, don't worry, I'm calling in the big guns.
Chuck, there's been a robbery at the Buy More.
brace yourself: the Santa suit is gone.
well, that's terrible. Sounds like someone could use a dose of the Christmas spirit.
just promise me that you and Sarah will make it in time for Christmas dinner.
Ellie really needs her family around right now.
Yeah, yeah, of course, buddy. We wouldn't miss it for the world.
my wife has been kidnapped, and I'm officially ruining Christmas for the children of Burbank.
we have a CIA Christmas party to crash.
now let's go save our girl.
Why's it getting so cold in here?
tapped into the internal generator, lowered the temperature.
to stop the mainframe from overheating.
once the virus activates, the resulting data influx could fry it in seconds.
you with me?
no, you're not.
if you were, you would've brought a coat, silly.
you're going into hypothermic shock.
pretty soon, you'll be in and out of consciousness until finally your heart stops beating.
why don't you just kill me?
kill you?
this is about you.
why do you think I wanted you in Castle and I sent Chuck to the CIA?
we both know that you're the superior spy.
I've missed you. - You're insane.
what we had was special. I know you felt it.
I'm sure you've laid in bed at night thinking about me beside you.
I'd rather be dead.
got what I needed.
this is Sarah Walker, and Daniel Shaw is in complete control of me.
I don't know what your plan is, but... it's not going to work.
Shaw's so handsome and smart. I bet he reads lots of books.
you think you can beat Chuck?
you're not half the man that he is.
you're not half the man that he is.
this isn't about Chuck, Sarah.
this really is about you.
see, I'm finally going to crush your soul...
the way that you crushed mine.
12 inches of bubbly cheese, spicy pepperoni and ham.
you really should try the Fresh Fit option.
no-no offense.- Thank you.
what have we got so far?
all right, so if this virus hits at the expected rate and magnitude, everything electronic will shut down-- traffic lights, computers.
God, can you imagine a world without the Internet? What if it's up to us?
two Buy More employees left to stop the Omen virus and save the world.
come on. The government has their best people working on this. Right?
God, I hate corporate Christmas parties.
everyone turns into sloppy, embarrassing messes.
Oh, Stan, not again.
how about joining me at the punch bowl?
enough. You're embarrassing yourself, Stan.
well, if that's gonna be your attitude.
that is so weird.
Los Angeles spies.
now focus.
the woman by the giant Subway sandwich is your target.
Colonel Caroline Hayne.
she's in charge of internal security with electronic access to every room in this building, including Decker's office.
so what's our next move? - Seduce her, Bartowski.
steal her key card.
she's a notorious tight ass, except for one night of the year.
tonight. Six hot toddies and men are running for cover.
and you're sure I'm her type?
you're drawing breath and you're in a Santa suit.
merry Christmas.
or Happy Hanukkah. Whichever is applicable.
you look like you want some alone time with old Saint Nick.
I want to sit on your lap.
I don't think Mrs. Claus would approve of any "shenanigans," you know.
well, it's a good thing Mrs. Claus is a no-show.
Oh, that seems inappropriate!
Ooh, yeah! Naughty Santa.
that's just how I like it.
Mr. Claus, I will personally escort you off the premises.
Oh, what a shame! Merry Christmas! Happy Kwanzaa!
pull yourself together.
play a little cat and mouse? Fine.
but I'll find you.
I know you're unarmed. The armory's been on lockdown.
you can't hide.
I know every secret, every mission, every mistake.
scar on your left hand-- Calgary, 2004.
you never tried catching throwing stars after that, did you?
I know everything, Sarah.
I know everything.
you're upset with me. That's obvious.
but do you really think I want to spend the holidays with you?
that I wouldn't rather be with my family?
it's a trick question, Sarah.
because you shot my wife in cold blood.
you brought this all upon yourself.
very disappointing, Casey.
never took Decker for much of an art collector.
I think I found it.
Colonel Hayne just accessed Decker's office, but I'm looking at her. She's in the bullpen.
we got a code five.
this way, Colonel Hayne.
our minute came and went.
what are we gonna do? There's no place to hide.
pucker up, Bartowski. You're about to become a man.
what, like a Bar Mitzvah? Or something that's a little... What exactly are you...
Santa!
retreat immediately or I will see you court-martialed!
you know, I typically brush my teeth before I... - We never speak of this again.
never... ever...
Shaw, I've got the device.
Chuck, it's me.
Sarah, oh, my God. You okay? - Yeah.
I escaped Shaw and I'm hiding in Castle,...
but Shaw's still down here--hurry!
I'm on my way.
I know, I know, I know. It's a madhouse. It's a madhouse.
good thing is that Jeff and Lester made some progress. How'd your day go?
I got the Macau Device, and Sarah's hiding out in Castle.
Sarah. Hey. Is everything okay?
Casey disarmed Shaw. He's locked up.
thank God. I'll be there soon. - Hurry up, dear.
how'd that go? Everything all right?
Sarah says that Casey took down Shaw.
Yes! Nice! Way to go.
she called me "dear. " She never calls me dear.
Shaw's using her somehow.
Oh, crap. Last time he was in control, he bought the Buy More.
Morgan, we've got to get all these people out of here.
I tried, Morgan. But we haven't made a single sale all night. I'm sorry.
don't be. Don't be, buddy. It's okay.
attention, Buy More shoppers.
I know everyone's a little scared about this Omen virus...
but, uh, you should not be waiting in line on Christmas Eve.
all right? It's not about the gifts, it's about spending time with your friends and your family.
And-and-and-and eggnog and cheer-- spreading lots of cheer.
so, uh, as of now, uh, the Buy More is officially closed for the holiday.
sorry! Thank you, come again and, uh, and shop at Buy More.
sorry! Sorry! You're gonna have to... gonna have to, kinda...
Thanks, buddy.
well, come on, son, I'll drive you home.
your mama's cooking us a big, fat, honey-glazed ham.
you know what? I'm gonna stay here and close up shop.
can you make sure everyone gets out safe?
all right. - Okay.
what's happening? - Ellie, what are you...? What are you...?
We're-We're-We're closing down for the night.
the picture with Santa was a bust.
I sent Devon and Clara home. Mom's flight's cancelled.
Sarah was supposed to help with the decorations, and now she's not answering her phone.
have you heard from her?
Yeah, uh, sort of. She's kind of busy.
Chuck, what's going on?
it's Shaw.
he kidnapped Sarah.
Daniel Shaw, who killed Dad?
what can I do?
I... I hate to say this--just-just go home. - No, I want to help!
Ellie, please, go home, okay? I have to know that you're safe.
okay, but call me. Call me as soon as you know something, okay?
Yes. Yes. Okay.
Chuck, you be careful. - I love you.
you sick son of a bitch!
just wanted to see if any of the old fire was still there.
no. Ice-cold.
this was Mary Bartowski's, wasn't it?
I think I'll keep it.
token of our last night together.
I had no idea she was your wife, Shaw.
I had no idea who you were. I was just... I was just on an assignment.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
I was just a young agent. I was just doing my job, okay?
you, of all people, need to understand that.
Really?
well, what about the pit you dug out of my chest?
is that supposed to fill it in?
is this going to?
you're a good man, Shaw. You can be that man again.
just stop what you're doing, please. Okay?
you can let this... you can let this all go.
I know you're in pain, and you want this to stop, but not yet.
not until you feel a pain more excruciating than you ever imagined.
Chuck is coming up with a way to stop you as we speak.
we have reason to believe this whole entire Omen virus, end of the world, apocalyptic thingy--it's a hoax--it's literally a hoax.
the virus is hypothetically designed to suck information out of a whole set of computers and move that information to a single location.
but it's not doing that. It's absolutely not doing that.
or it's not doing that with our computers. It looks like this virus is targeting government computers.
I think it's a real-life conspiracy.
problem is, no one computer can hold all that information.
right? Right? - Yeah. Of course not. Of course not...
Morgan, it's not going into a computer.
Shaw is using the Macau Device to relocate the CIA database into his brain.
he's trying to create the Intersect 3. 0.
Oh, crap. With the CIA's databases wiped clean, they'll have to rely on Shaw for their intel.
they have to make him a spy again.
gentlemen! Gentlemen, uh... the Buy More is closed.
you can go home. Happy holidays. Maybe drink some water.
water can only dilute this feeling.
Plus, fish have sex in it. Jeffrey, let's go for a run.
great idea. Great idea. - Great idea.
all right, Chuck, tell me you got some kind of an idea here,'cause I'm a little scared.
don't freak out. I've got an idea.
I just hope it works. - Me, too.
seeing as how our lives kind of depend on it.
you knew that, right? - Yeah.
you've got the device. Now let Sarah go and take me instead.
and why would I trust you?
look at the monitor.
buy More is empty. You can come up here and kill me.
as long as Sarah's safe.
pitiful.
good, you're awake.
you know what the ultimate revenge is?
spending Christmas Eve with you.
I'm gonna let you live.
I want you to watch while I kill your husband.
Chuck has a plan. - So do I.
and I've spent the last two years in prison, perfecting it.
you killed my wife.
now you're gonna suffer, just like I did.
you're gonna spend the rest of your life without Chuck.
Hi, I'm Mr. Pippers, the Preppy Polar Bear.
you can leave a message by pressing hard on my paw. Have fun.
dad...
I just want you to know that I'm proud of you...
and I'm sorry I haven't been there for you all these years.
and I'm really sorry that I'm having to tell you this recorded on an electronic bear.
electronic bear.
I'm unarmed.
you can shoot me now, if that's your plan.
but for some reason, I don't think it is.
no, you're absolutely right.
it's very important that I enjoy this.
Really?
well, that's a nice idea, Shaw.
however, if I remember correctly, the last time we were face to face, I kicked your ass.
I made sure that'll never happen again.
no Intersect to help you this time, Chuck.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
I've been training for a while now.
Oh, really?
well, can you compete with the Intersect 3. 0?
I can practically catch a bullet in my teeth.
but you did some push-ups? You hit the heavy bag?
Oh, just so you know, while you're begging for mercy, your wife is watching.
I've spent every waking second in jail thinking about this moment.
this time, I'm going to kill you.
you seriously underestimate the power of the Nerd Herd.
the Omen virus-- you put it...
inside your head. Instead of downloading the Intersect 3. 0, you removed it.
and it turns out that's the last flash you're ever going to have.
I'm a much bigger nerd than you thought I was.
Oh, geez.
wake up. Wake... Oh, my God, you're like an ice cube.
hang in there. I got this. I got this.
uh, I'm going to pick you up with the chair. All right, so just bear with me.
okay.
Oh, man.
one, two...
I'm still going to kill you.
I'd like to see you try.
I've been working on that one. That one's for Sarah.
is that all you got? - I got a little bit more.
all right, listen to me. Listen to me. You're going to have to wake up.
you have to wake up because you're bolted in here and I don't have a key for the lock.
what are you...? Y-you're shot. You're-you're bleeding.
shut up, numbnuts. We got to get her out of here.
get her.
dear"? "Hurry up, dear"?
sloppy, Shaw.
won't happen again.
that was for my dad.
you're good, Chuck.
but you're not lucky.
that was for me.
nice shot, sis.
but I told you to stay at home.
I'm Eleanor Woodcomb. Since when do I do what I'm told?
that man took our father away from us, Chuck.
I wasn't going to let him take anybody else.
merry Christmas, Ellie.
merry Christmas, Chuck.
authorities have confirmed, that the Omen virus was planted by a terrorist named Daniel Shaw.
a private security team stopped him before the virus was activated.
and although they've chosen to remain anonymous, we here at KCKH want to say thank you and also wish our viewers a happy holiday.
and now, onto other news, where a dog barks like a duck.
all members of Carmichael Industries have a position open to them at the CIA.
the agency would be lucky to have you back.
well, we couldn't have done it without you. So thanks, colleague.
with that, I'll bid you farewell and Merry Christmas.
do you have a place to spend the holidays? You could come to our place.
Yeah, but, Sarah, I think my Christmas party's a bust. - No, no, no, no.
your Christmas party is not a bust, sis.
don't you know that when you roll with General Diane Beckman, you roll in style?
general...
don't you think the CIA could help us throw just a little eensy-weensy Bartowski family Christmas party?
you're talking about American tax dollars at work.
Oh, hell, let's do it.
that's the spirit.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
I know that without Mom and Dad around, it could never be a perfect Christmas, but I hope you know that you'll always have me.
I do.
felt pretty good taking down Shaw.
I think Dad would be proud.
I know he would be.
I miss him. - Me, too.
I love you. - I love you, too.
merry Christmas.
I, uh... made a recording when things got a little grim.
it's just that... it's probably better I tell you in person.
I love you.
I love you, too, Dad.
I know it's a... just a little bear.
it's not going to make up for all the lost holidays, but...
no, it's... it's perfect.
you know, that... that Grimes kid, he's not that bad.
you should... maybe give him another chance.
it was fun, man. Like old times, before you got all smart.
it's actually the only Christmas Eve I remember.
I'm usually drunk on Manischewitz by now.
I miss that.
thank you.
for defeating Daniel Shaw? For stopping the Omen virus?
or was it me getting us invited to rejoin the CIA?
for saving me. - Technically, Morgan saved you.
because of all the saving that was going on,
I wasn't able to get you your gift in time for Christmas; however... however...
an oldie, but a goodie.
I hope that this will suffice for now.
thank you.
smile!
Oh, now she'll always be able to remember her first Christmas.
merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
Chuck, you should know that, um, while I was tied up in Castle, Shaw kissed me.
well, as long as we're airing things out, you should know...
that Beckman kissed me.
Walker. A word.
general, I know about the, um... with you and Chuck.
we all have to make sacrifices for the job.
Shaw requested a meet with you.
I suggest you don't go.
what?
I'm glad you came.
I'll be locked in solitary the rest of my life.
but one thing's going to keep me warm at night.
little something I put into motion that you'll never be able to stop.
do you remember Hungary?
our time capsule was buried in 1987.

reagan told Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall.
you had a huge crush on LaToya Jackson.
I did.
you can't complain, Stinson.
you married the head cheerleader.
lucky I did.
and now we have a wonderful kid who's a senior, right here at Foothill.
Alex, take a bow.
anyhow, we're here today to open the time capsule that we buried 20 years ago, so we can see who we were and how the heck we all got to where we are today.
found it!
twenty years...
do you even remember what you put in there?
no. A bad perm and pink leg warmers, probably.
here we go!
God! That is vile!
Oh, what the hell, Bill?
I thought you said the thing was watertight?
it should've been, and it's Gil, not Bill.
let's see what we've got here.
what is it?!
Wow! Now this is a sweet field.
this is what I'm talking about.
right? I mean, it's nothing like ours, but, hey, that didn't stop me from being MVP my senior year.
got the trophy, touchdown!
in certain tribes, in the African subcontinent, piercings serve as a reminder, like your trophy, of the power and agility, which has since faded away.
what do you mean, fade away?
o Whoa! Timeout.
can we just concentrate on the case? What do we got here?
we were all gathered for the opening. We had no idea that that thing was in there.
Whoa!
that is rank.
I was just expecting to see my 10, 000 Maniacs album.
that was not there. Who are you?
I'm Gil Bates. I sealed it myself.
I used a propylene seal and industrial bolt lags.
adolescent, Caucasian male, late teens, early 20s.
all right, so, what do you say we just pack it all up and ship it back to the Jeffersonian?
Oh, I'm sorry. That's not a good idea.
you see, the water has compromised the structural integrity of the case, so...
well, will you look at this, Bones. Another nerd for your squint squad.
drill.
drill? Whoa, wait a second. You're going to drill it right here? What about taking it all back to Jeffersonian?
tub.
a 1987 Foothill High School yearbook, of course.
how about th-the ghetto blaster?
Whoo! Yeah!
Rubik's Cube?
how about this? CD, no needle required.
in 20 years, they'll be able to put hundreds of those on a microchip.
victim had several antemortem fractures to his sternum, as well as several antemortem fractures to the lateral sections of his ribs.
all healed?
all healed at different times.
I had a Michael Jackson glove.
I've never mentioned that before.
I loved Chevy Chase.
we all have our crosses to bear.
the fracture on the right clavicle is fresh.
well, was, 20 years ago.
mullet alert!
Ooh, that's a nasty one.
booth got a list of all the students who didn't make it to the capsule opening, and he's pulling the names of anyone connected to the school in 1987 who had a record.
Oh, my God, I'm getting flashbacks to braces and stirrup pants and a really, really bad side ponytail.
you certainly grew out of it.
I wore Doc Marten's that weighed more than I did.
apparently Booth was fine. He was a football player.
right. He was one of those guys.
well, this guy certainly wasn't hanging out with the cheerleaders, but I bet he had some love notes stashed away in his Spaceballs binder.
I think I saw him in the video.
Roger Dillon.
class of 1987.
here he is.
the comet will be around in 76 years. We'll still be around, don't worry.
how did Roger Dillon get from there..
to here?
I ran a sample of the sludge.
organic matter.
or you could call him "Roger."
Oh, come on, when you can ladle someone, he's a little less than a person, don't you think?
fine. I took a sample of Roger, ran it through the mass spectrometer.
you'll never guess what I found.
traces of an unidentified organophosphate.
nerve gas? Very good.
I'll break down the rest chemicals now.
the victim also had a peri-mortem fracture in his wrist.
there are indications of a grade-two acromioclavicular joint separation.
but it was certainly not lethal.
I've seen it before. Someone twisted the victim's arm behind his back, forcefully.
so, what, he got beat up for his lunch money?
violent students are the hallmark of a schoolyard.
I speak from experience.
however, these fractures on his ribs might predate high school.
so... he might've had some trouble at home.
I don't understand, Mr. Dillon, why you never reported your son missing.
his mother told me that Roger ran away.
you weren't concerned that your son never contacted you again?
he didn't live with me, he didn't want to.
because of the physical abuse?
Yeah, I was a drinker in those days.
and I understood why he wanted to just write me off.
but I cared about him. I was sick.
when was the last time you saw Roger?
it was night of his high school graduation.
he came over here, afterwards, asking me for money, a lot.
you threw him out of the house with his arm twisted behind his back.
I swear, he... he got up and he walked away.
now this was 20 years ago.
what's this all about?
Roger is dead, Mr. Dillon.
his remains were found yesterday.
Oh... God...
found him at the high school. He had been in a time capsule for 20 years.
any idea why he needed the money?
wouldn't say. Guess it was so he could run away.
you should talk to Gil. He was Roger's best friend.
Gil Bates? Yeah.
that's the Tech Town guy?
Yeah. They did everything together.
we'll be in touch.
I'm different now.
I'm sober. I never... I never wanted to hurt him. I loved Roger.
right.
the kid basically melted into all of this.
I should be able to pull more chemical traces off the artifacts to I. D.the organophosphate on him.
Beta-- St. Elmo's Fire.
it's on the list.

remember those days?
I remember getting grounded every weekend.
so many rules to break, so little time...
you were the nerd fantasy.
I was all about Barbie.
she was my first anatomy lesson.
I was confused for years.
what about Ken? I felt so sorry for him.
floppy dis the size of a dinner plate.
bingo, baby. The disk is not on the list.
wow, what are you? A term paper?
launch codes?
we need to pull the data. Do you think you're up to it?
I can try.
a hockey skate.
and it looks like it's signed.
check on the skate.
it belonged to some jock named John Adamson.
a can of New Coke.
definitely an '80's plot to destabilize the country.
another check.
and a pocket watch.
the watch is not on the list.
it's a Wallingham.
it's nice. A computer disk and a pocket watch?
what was our little geek into?
it's dry.
this is a good watch.
some kind of residue.
could it help I. D. the poison?
let me at it.
Roger's father had no trouble getting physical.
so why would he resort to poisoning his son with a nerve agent?
what sort of teenager were you, Bones?
he did have a series of odd jobs.
perhaps he procured the poison from one of them.
come on, you have to have at least one good story before you pasted on a lab coat.
I was busy, studying.
and in all those hours of studying, you never came across one hormone?
fine, there was one boy.
he was the varsity lacrosse captain.
did you kiss...the varsity lacrosse captain?
I was weighing the pros and cons...
when he became my Secret Santa.
I thought you hated Secret Santa.
Yes, because he taped the gift to my locker.
everyone saw it.
teenagers can be cruel.
what was it? It doesn't matter.
come on, Bones.
you promise not to laugh?
listen, I'm your partner.
it was a Brainy Smurf.
you said you wouldn't laugh.
I'm not laughing. Brainy Smurf, huh?
well, it was deliberate. He knew I wanted Smurfette.
okay, it's clear you find this amusing.
I'm not laughing.
I'm not.
what?
you know, Angel was right--you were one of those guys.
what? One of what guys?
that was Roger in the time capsule?
I saw his skull.
Oh, my God, I saw his skull.
he's been there since 1987.
no, Roger took off. He left a note.
a note?
graduation night, he left his mom a note, saying that he hated it here and he was running away.
Yeah, and he went to his father's house to ask for money. Do you know why?
all I knew was what his mom said was in the note he left, so...
Gil, his mother was dead, and his father never saw it, so...
so, you're the only connection we have to the note.
it said, uh...
you know that he couldn't be around his dad anymore.
or the kids at school.
they picked on him.
they used to pick on me, too.
I guess, he just couldn't take it.
why wouldn't he have just asked for help?
he was my best friend.
I always thought that I'd see him again.
I can't believe I'll never see him again.
all right, I found several denim cotton fibers on both the gold watch and the floppy, matching what's left of the victim's classic acid wash '80s jeans.
that places the watch and the disk inside the victim's pocket at the time of his murder.
I tested the residue inside the watch casing.
pure crystalline tropane alkaloid.
Roger Dillon had a pocket watch full of cocaine?
it's so Miami Vice, I could roll up my sleeves.
the FBI sent us the files of everyone connected to the school who had a record.
mostly petty theft, DUI s, that sort of thing.
darwin Banks. Teacher at Foothill High.
arrested in a school wide drug bust, June 12, 1987.
that's two days after Roger disappeared.
and Roger needed money.
looks like our young geek might've been killed over a drug deal.
do you remember Roger Dillon?
Foothill High, right?
I was his science teacher.
smart kid.
he could've taught the class.
now he's dead.
we found him stuffed into Foothill's time capsule.
been there since 1987.
God...
and it says here in the yearbook that you were the faculty advisor to the time capsule committee.
you gotta be kidding.
I usually don't joke around when a 17-year-old boy's been murdered.
found evidence of cocaine on him.
Roger?
no. That kid was clean.
the only way he got high was sitting in front of his computer writing code.
right, so help me out here, because in '87 you were arrested at the high school for dealing.
I wasn't dealing. I was just out of college.
I had two joints on me.
and four ounces in your apartment.
I was 23.
we all do crazy stuff when we're kids.
exactly.
I have my own business now, a wife and two kids.
I'm in the Rotary Club for God's sake.
well, we know that Roger needed money. Maybe he started dealing for you, and he wanted a bigger payout, threatened to turn you in if he didn't get it, so you killed him?
I didn't kill him and Roger didn't rat me out.
it was Adamson, John Adamson, an entitled ass even at 17.
I caught him cheating and the next thing I know, the cops are knocking on my classroom door.
he just wanted to discredit me, so he could retake the test.
right. So you're the victim with four ounces of weed?
can you confirm your whereabouts on June 14, 1987?
if I'm such a big drug-dealing liar, why would I tell you the truth?
because you don't want to go to jail for killing Roger Dillon.
come on, sweets, come on, you've done a lot of psychological profiling.
the case is 20 years old, we just need some help.
that's not why we're here today, Agent Booth.
this hour is for you and Dr. Brennan.
Oh, she's not gonna mind; it's only gonna take five minutes, okay? 1987.
suburban kid is killed and stuffed into a time capsule.
fascinating, right?
what kind of person would do that?
so have any conflicts or issues arisen since our last session?
well...
bones and I are doing just great.
you look angry, Dr. Brennan.
I told Agent Booth a private story about my childhood and he laughed.
what?
no, I...
I was appreciating it. Don't get him involved.
snorting does not suggest appreciation.
it was about a cartoon character from the...
1980s. I didn't think you'd be so sensitive. Well, childhood icons have great significance to us, Agent Booth, all right?
I myself was very attached to Voltron.
cartoon.
you're hurt, Dr. Brennan, because you feel you opened yourself up to Agent Booth and he betrayed that trust.
we're talking about a Smurf.
Smurfette.
a childhood story about yourself.
show your vulnerability to Dr. Brennan.
no, you know what? This is crazy.
it's... it's not right. Tell him that it's not right. Is it?
Oh, you're on his side. Why don't you go play Voltron with him?
you were that guy, weren't you, Agent Booth?
you were the golden boy who could get away with anything just by turning on the charm.
that's ridiculous. You don't even know who I am.
could it be that you're still holding on to that persona, that you're afraid to reveal yourself?
I'm an FBI agent. I get shot at every day, all right?
I'm not afraid of anything. Okay, this is obviously very difficult for you.
but you shouldn't be ashamed to ask for help.
you shouldn't.
okay.
okay.
I apologize. I do need help.
with this case.
so, while you review this,
I will reveal myself to Bones.
I know that sounded weird, but you know what I mean.
so you will share an emotionally humiliating episode from your youth with me?
Yeah. I-I have them.
here.
all right. Excellent.
now, for the remainder of our time, let's role play.
now I know why I'm not allowed to bring my gun in here.
I tested the goop, found traces of cocaine consistent with the leakage from the gold watch.
but when I checked the results against samples of his hair and bones, it came out negative; Roger didn't do drugs.
so his old teacher was telling the truth?
I also discovered what he was dosed with and how much. What?
Malaoxon.
Malaoxon? -Yeah.
is neurotoxic in high doses.
Yeah, but there was barely enough to make a mouse cough.
so our theory about poisoning is incorrect as well.
Dr. Saroyan, I found an anomaly on the victim's skull.
when I was cleaning the skull,
I found a tiny irregularity on the undersurface of the victim's mandible.
magnified, it proved to be a tiny, but sharply defined fracture. Judging by its location, it appears that a weapon was cutting through the sternocleidomastoid, neck, and severing both the carotid artery and jugular vein.
which means Roger must have bled out.
have you determined a weapon?
judging by the microscopic crushing of the bone, the weapon was neither too sharp nor too blunt.
it certainly wasn't an edged weapon.
so it wasn't a knife?
correct. However, it left an odd textural stain in the crevice.
I've taken a sample and will hand it over to Hodgins for testing.
this little darling is a Commodore Amiga, with a Motorola 6800 chip set using a homemade operating system.
I got it from the computer exhibit on the third floor.
I used to have this exact computer.
my geek princess.
I knew the mall couldn't suck out your soul.
Hey, look at that.
Oh, this is incredible!
this is like a primitive Doom.
you don't see anything wrong with that?
doom came out in 1993.
all of this stuff
the 3-D rendering, the first person shooting
was barely a glint in a geek's eye in 1987!
so Roger was way ahead of his time.
if this game had come out in 1987,
Roger Dillon would have been a billionaire several times over.
money is always a good motive for murder.
I'm pretty sure that Sweets would say a lost baseball game is not personal or revealing.
football, Bones, okay. It's football.
Oh, okay, I got one. All right, personally between two people or revealing, like, uh...
Aha! Naked?
that's very literal.
there was this girl, Karen Isley, and we were under the bleachers one night.
personally. You with me?
got it. You were having sex in the dirt under the bleachers.
excuse me, I'm a gentleman.
I brought my sleeping bag.
did you fail to perform sexually?
what? 'Cause that might actually count as a humiliation.
will you just wait? Will you just allow me to tell my story?
fine. Thank you. All right, so this girl, she had this game where she would ask me a question...
what kind of a question?
it doesn't matter, okay? So, if I got the question wrong, I'd have to...
take off a piece of my clothing. Of course I knew all the answers, but I pretended that I didn't.
so you could take off your clothes?
exactly.
no, the point is, I'm standing there, you know, in my socks, and my St. Christopher medal...
she runs off.
she runs off with the sleeping bag and all of my clothes.
and I'm standing there stark.
why'd she do that?
well, I suppose she heard I was under the bleachers with another girl the week before.
okay, this is a story about sexual prowess, Booth. You're bragging.
I had to run across the campus buck naked.
you're laughing about it now.
you enjoyed displaying your penis.
it showed alpha male mastery.
only one other person knew about Brainy Smurf, was my mother.
cold, okay, it was cold.
do you know what happens to a guy when it is cold...
outside?
Hi. Hi.
can we make this quick? My boss doesn't understand why I keep leaving.
and he's kind of a jerk, so.
what do you know about, uh...
WarStrike"?
Wow.
I, I haven't heard that name in a long time.
we found it on a disk in the time capsule.
it was on Roger when he was killed.
Oh, my God.
so you knew about it?
Yeah, but only as a drawing in his notebook.
I-I didn't know he'd written the code.
Yeah, well, according to an expert at the Jeffersonian, someone could make a lot of money off of it.
we planned to. We were gonna start a gaming business after graduation.
Roger was the brain, and I was the business guy.
wait... you saw the game?
it worked?
if you were partners, why wouldn't he tell you that?
he was a perfectionist.
he would never show me anything unless he thought it was perfect.
Yeah, well, maybe he was trying to make a deal with someone else.
no. No way.
we were partners, okay. Best friends our whole lives.
Roger would never sell me out like that.
we were saving up to buy new computers to create a 3-D rendering farm.
computers were expensive back then.
where were you gonna get the money? We both worked.
I paved driveways and...
Roger worked a shift at a roller rink.
Yeah, I scraped grills at a burger shack for $3. 55 an hour.
that's humiliating.
nice try. Roger, he made extra money, um, tutoring that cheerleader, Janelle, in math.
and he got paid to take the SATs for some cokehead hockey player.
the kid got into Harvard off Roger's scores.
cokehead?
what's his name?
he's a real nasty piece of work.
great, thanks.
John Adamson was the star hockey player at Foothill.
he barely graduated from Harvard
took five years. He got in by cheating.
he didn't deserve to be there.
maybe Roger was blackmailing Adamson about the SAT scam.
so Adamson killed him?
could a hockey skate have killed the kid?
I mean, Adamson's was in the time capsule.
a metal skate blade could easily cut right through the jugular.
and the edge could create a sharply defined fracture.
well, there you go. He had a motive and a weapon.
the back table, waiting...
John Adamson? FBI Agent Seely Booth.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
have a seat, Bones.
senator expects me to concentrate on running his campaign, Agent Booth.
I hope this isn't going to be a waste of my time.
take a look at that.
do you remember Gilbert Bates or Roger Dillon from high school?
no, I'm sorry.
neither the name Gilbert Bates nor Roger Dillon means anything to me.
this boy was found inside the time capsule dead.
you might've heard about that. Like I said,
I've been busy with the senator's campaign.
Oh, because this kid said that this guy took the SAT for you.
got you into Harvard.
SATs didn't get me into Harvard, Agent Booth.
my slap shot did that.
so you don't deny that Roger Dillon took the test for you?
total cooperation.
we keep my sordid academic past in the past?
I paid Roger 200 bucks to take the test for me.
it was a done deal.
two weeks later, he comes knocking at my door, saying if I don't cough up another $500, he'll rat me out.
Roger told you why he needed the money? No.
just that a guy like me wouldn't understand.
I gave him all the cash I had.
maybe 90 bucks and my watch.
the watch with the hidden compartment for cocaine?
???
what?
uh, you're a very slow reader, Dr. Sweets.
I'm afraid Agent Booth's report on Mr. Adamson is more revealing of Agent Booth than it is of Adamson.
Really? Why?
that's for Agent Booth to share.
but I've seen John Adamson on TV enough to know that while he's harmful to the political process, he's not homicidal.
he's too sensitive.
a horny, cocaine-snorting, jock, party boy is sensitive?
Yes, definitely. And emotionally immature, totally dependent upon external validation.
cheap and greedy, too. They're always cheap and greedy.
you got all this off TV?
the point is, at the age of 17,
John Adamson gave Roger Dillon money and a watch.
if he had killed Roger, he would have taken his watch back.
very convincing. The watch part anyway.
all that insight into the intangible enigma of human behavior, and you zone in on the banal and tangible.
I bring more banal and tangible evidence.
Wow. With you people, it's really go, go, go, isn't it?
we're catching murderers.
and that is so dope, all right? I'm running up a profile right now to help.
I love being in the field.
uh, you're in a secure lab.
dude, for eight hours a day, I'm surrounded by neurotics.
okay, to me, this is field work.
uh, no offense, Dr. Brennan.
I'll finish the profile.
anyhow, we've determined that the Malaoxon in the Roger stew was originally the common organophosphate pesticide, malathion, before it broke down.
how common? There was this 1980s mosquito panic, and malathion was sprayed everywhere.
virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says there was a quadrant bordering Foothill High School that was sprayed at 7: 45 p. m. on Thursday, June 14, 1987.
whoa.
why'd they keep such detailed records?
spraying aerial neurotoxins in an attempt to kill creatures that outlive atomic bombs tends to make bureaucrats consider possible lawsuits, I guess.
it's a housing development.
Yes, but in 1987, it was mostly a swamp.
the development was under construction.
there were only a few finished homes.
could the wind have blown the insecticide onto Roger?
in this concentration, Roger had to have been wading right through the middle of it.
why would he do that?
there's only one reason.
a girl.
what are you basing that on?
I was a boy.
and I searched the 1987 real estate records.
guess who lived in one of the only finished houses.
Janelle Brown, head cheerleader.
he was tutoring her in math.
exactly.
why would he wade through a swamp to get to the house?
there had to be roads.
it was quicker. She was a cheerleader.
she was hot. He couldn't wait.
the boy thing again.
or maybe he was peeping through her window.
could have been a peeper.
Dr. Hodgins, do boys change after high school?
only on the outside.
whoever thought hair like that looked good?
Hey, check this out.
this is weird, right?
it's a yearbook.
it's supposed to be weird and humiliating.
Yeah, but this is the "Hall of Fame" section.
it's usually, "Best Smile" and "Most Likely to Succeed.
this is "Most Likely to Get Head Stuck Up Own Ass
and "Best Rack" and "Most Likely to die of VD.
wait. Somebody put a prank version of the yearbook in the capsule to embarrass everyone 20 years later?
Yup. Look at this.
brought to you by Gruff & Grim.
so, we're looking for two kids who put a yearbook and a body into the time capsule?
okay, Bones, so there was this girl, okay?
she was the coolest, hottest girl in high school.
and I wanted to ask her to my junior prom, so what I did was,
I bribed the suck-up who did the morning announcements.
Suck-up?
Yeah, the kids who did anything to please the teachers.
so I get on the loudspeaker, and I ask her to prom.
Uh-huh.
on the loudspeaker.
this is your embarrassing story?
on the loudspeaker. Yeah.
I got laughed at for weeks.
did she go with you to the prom?
sure.
okay, this is merely another story of victory and sexual conquest.
look, Bones, they laughed at me.
okay, laughing has got to count for something.
there's no public humiliation in that story, Booth.
you don't even know what public humiliation is.
Hi. Hi.
uh, Ms. Stinson, Special Agent Booth, uh...
was your name Janelle Brown in high school?
Yes. Mind if we come in and ask you a few questions?
of course, yeah. Come in.
look at her.
I wish I was Janelle Brown again. Or at least parts of me do.
you know what I mean?
you lived at 224 Green Gates
crescent?
Yeah, just a few blocks from here.
it backed onto a swamp.
Yeah. I was scared of that swamp as a little girl.
how well did you know Roger Dillon?
Oh, I don't know. He was my math tutor.
and, well, math wasn't really my thing, so I needed a lot of help, and, well...
he kind of developed a crush on me.
he was actually kind of cute in a non-jock way, you know?
sweet.
Oh, he loved The Cure.
for what? What did he have?
it's a band, Bones.
it's... It's...It's a band.
um, did he tutor you at your place?
my place or the library. Usually my place.
I think he liked it there. You know, his own place wasn't very nice.
do you remember seeing him on, uh, June 14, 1987?
mom? Uh, I'm in here, honey.
it would have been the last day of school. Oh, uh...
I'm going to Pete's. Okay.
what's going on? Um, these people are with the FBI.
they're investigating the time capsule murder.
nothing to worry about. Your parents were just friends of the victim.
well, that sucks.
Yeah. Honey, why don't you go to Pete's?
if you're going to be late, just give me a call, 'cause you have your cell phone, right?
I have it.
okay.
what are you doing?
see you later, Mom. Okay.
you know, I-I think I actually did see Roger on the last day of school.
Why?
like I said, he was my tutor.
why would he come to your house on the last day of school?
honestly?
he brought me my graded final, but he'd have used any excuse.
I didn't encourage him, but...
high school was so long ago, and none of us is the same person.
I'm sorry Roger ended up that way, but after he dropped off my final,
I never saw him again, so...
well, uh...
thank you, Ms. Stinson. Oh, yes. Uh-huh, of course.
could you please call up Terry Stinson from the Foothill yearbook?
Mm-hmm.
track team, Vice President of the Student Council, runner up for Mr. Popularity.
where does it say that?
it's the type, sweetie.
he's Mr. Second Best.
it's kind of like when you want Brad Pitt and you get Matthew McConnaghey.
and pull up the photo of his son, Alex. Alex Stinson shows three classic examples of Mendelian inheritance.
a cheek dimple on the left side, cleft chin and detached earlobes.
distinct facial features.
wide set eyes, asymmetrical nostrils.
just like his dad.
it's nothing like his dad.
Oh, boy.
could you please replace Terry Stinson with Roger Dillon?
Oh, boy.
20 years ago, Terry Stinson finds out that Roger Dillon has sex with his girlfriend.
and he kills him.
er. We'll take a DNA test.
you realize in a murder investigation, we can't rule anything out.
did you know that it was possible that Alex was not your biological son?
what?
is it possible?
is it?
can I answer that after the DNA test?
I guess I just did.
so you didn't know?
Terry didn't know.
Alex was born on January 7, 1988.
I don't believe this.
that means you were pregnant in the spring already.
you just wanted me to believe that the baby was mine?
no, no.
I wanted... the baby inside me to be yours.
I don't get this.
Roger-- what... but he was...
why did you sleep with Roger?
he was sweet. He was...
I knew he was nuts about me.
I liked feeling special.
let's face it, Terry; back then, you were that guy.
what guy?
the guy who did anything he wanted. You didn't need me.
Roger, he came over that day. He came through the swamp. He was filthy.
his father had just beaten him up...
ms. Stinson, did you tell Roger that he had gotten you pregnant?
Yes.
he wanted to marry me.
he said he could get the money for us to go away together, but I told him I didn't want to.
I was back with you by then.
only you.
why didn't you tell me?
when I told you I was pregnant, you were so happy.
that's when I knew that you loved me. That you weren't "that guy.
we could have a great life together and we did. I'm sorry.
I had to borrow one of your pictures.
you stole that.
what did you think happened to Roger?
I don't know. He had the money. He was never happy here.
I figured that he just took off by himself.
I am so sorry.
I always wanted to tell you the truth, but I just... I just couldn't figure out how to tell you that Alex wasn't yours.
Alex is my son.
we are a family.
well, the murder happened at night on a high school playing field, not a likely place to find adults.
Plus, teenagers are dominated by their I.D.s, which make them act irrationally.
physiologically, their judgment's impaired by an incomplete frontal lobe. You're what, 22, right?
how's your front lobe?
almost there?
again, a hectoring tone.
all right, look, I'm sorry, just keep going.
all right, there was no sexual assault, no theft.
the watch and other effects were still on him.
further indications that this was just a rash and youthful act.
right, right. That's good for a kid.
this is guess work, Booth.
it's a logical interpretation of subjective analysis by a highly intelligent expert in his field, actually.
the killer knew the exact date the time capsule would be opened when he put the vi in there.
he's been waiting 20 years for that body to be found so he could reconcile himself with his past, and finally pay for his crime.
like Terry Stinson?
no.
I think you're looking for someone who's been punishing himself for years.
someone self-destructive, working far below his potential.
then why doesn't he just confess?
most likely he has in some way, Agent Booth.
the question is, were you listening?
agent Booth is an incredibly good listener.
Yeah, I really am. It's my strength.
then perhaps the time capsule was just a convenient place to stash a body.
you know, profiling's not an exact science.
but I hope I'm right. I really want to tell my girlfriend
I helped catch a murderer.
it'd be a good night for me.
the textural stain on the undersurface of Roger's mandible was liquid petroleum.
an oil product? I know. I know. Dead common, right?
but I did some further analysis.
I found that there were microscopic particles of granite embedded in the petroleum.
also, all over the broken seal to the time capsule.
definitely not John Adamson's ice skate.
Yeah, not unless he skated on asphalt.
20 years ago what I'm seeing as petroleum was asphalt.
it was driven into Roger's bone with a flat, metal...
an asphalt shovel?
Yeah.
Gil Bates worked paving driveways.
Roger was my best friend.
gruff and Grim, right?
who was who?
I was Gruff. Roger was Grim.
so you went out to the field that night to plant the yearbook in the time capsule.
right, surprise everyone 20 years down the line.
you dug up the capsule and you broke the seal with the asphalt shovel.
your amigo, Grim, wanted his money back?
the money that you earmarked for your business, all those computers that were going to make you rich.
and you couldn't do that, Gruff.
you just couldn't give Grim back the money. Could you stop using those names?
did he tell you that it was for Janelle Brown?
I bet he did. I bet old Grim said, "You know what, I'm sorry, Gruff, but there's this girl. Our plans, they're dust.
I asked you to just stop using the names.
you know, but then Grim said, "My dream has changed.
you and me, Gruff and Grim, we're finished." Stop it!
you don't know what you're talking about!
we don't know what?
did he tell you it was because she was pregnant?
he should've told you.
you would have understood.
understood what?
Janelle was pregnant with Roger's son.
Oh, my God.
he didn't say.
he just said that he loved her.
I told him...I told him how stupid that was.
I said that she'd never look at someone like him and...
he got all pissed and then he hit me.
and I just, I went and I picked up the shovel and I just...
I just jabbed.
it was an accident.
it was just a jab.
he held his neck.
and he went all white.
the wound severed both his jugular and his carotid.
he would have died quickly.
he did.
I... I held him and I told him I was sorry.
he knew that I didn't mean it.
I loved the guy.
he has a kid?
Yes.
I hope I get the chance to tell him about his father.
all right, there was this kid, uh, junior year.
okay, is this going to be another story where you think you were humiliated, but you actually were not?
just listen to me. This kid, junior year, Harlan Kinney.
he was one of those real weird, you know, looking kids. He had this big Adam's apple sticking out.
and he wore his dad's clothes to school.
you know, with the whole stretchy belt around his waist.
what's wrong with that? It's practical.
you're not listening.
he was one of those real superior types, always talking out of a thesaurus.
and one day he came up to me and a bunch of my buddies and he called us a bunch of Philistines.
you know what that means, right?
Yeah. A Philistine is a smug, ignorant person who is antagonistic toward higher thought and intelligence.
well, I didn't know what that meant till I looked it up.
I told Kinney, "Look, I'm not Philistine, I'm Catholic.
that's pretty close to humiliation.
no, that's embarrassing.
that's not the humiliating part.
Oh. My buddy, picked Kinney up and dangled him over the stairway.
you know, he begged and cried, and everyone laughed.
how is this about you?
I laughed.
I don't understand.
I could've stopped it.
I could've stepped in and helped the kid out.
instead I... I didn't.
I chose my side, and it was the wrong side.
so you were humiliated because you didn't act like a hero?
fine, fine, you know what?
I'm perfect. My life was perfect.
it's a good story, okay?
but it's a bad one.
I mean, it's both, I guess.
I mean, I get it.
yeah?
what is that?
nothing.
well, you evolved. And evolution is very impressive.
and that is definitely not nothing.
this?
did you bring that for me?
no. Good, because it's the wrong Smurf.
I liked Smurfette; that's Brainy Smurf.
Smurfette was stupid, shallow Smurf who only had her looks.
look, you're better than Smurfette.
you have your looks and a whole lot more.
you did bring that for me to charm me in case, I didn't find your humiliation story impressive, but I did so... Aha.
so I did impress you.
that's what "impressive" means, dummy.
you're such a Philistine. Ha-ha.
I'll tell you what.
you can hold on to this, and it will remind you how far I've come.
I forgive you for snorting, Booth.
evolution is a long, long process.
it takes hundreds of years.
thousands.
why do you have to always correct me?
to help you evolve.
it's a simple proposal - you, me, a bottle of Cristal.
I gotta take this.
welcome to Tasty Time.
like to try our new chocolate sundae?
Hello?
come in Houston.
tasty Time. Over.
number 17.
okay.
uno diecisiete coming up.
want that monster-sized?
I'll take that as a no.
$6. 43. Pull forward.
that was very funny.
Hey, who's gonna pay for this?
so according to the Tasty Time kid over here, this whole thing started when the convertible just cruised through the fast food window.
got nailed by the truck.
you know what they say, fast food kills you.
not usually quite so faSt.
so the witnesses at the burger joint said that the car seemed to be on autopilot - no driver.
so maybe he had a heart attack or an aneurysm and slumped over after ordering.
last supper, favorite restaurant.
he didn't have a chance to enjoy it.
the R. O. is Danny Clegg.
he's got a long sheet - burglary, assault possession, you know.
what did he order?
Why?
curious.
he ordered a number 17 - triple cheeseburger deluxe.
okay. All right.
so Jeep gets clipped by this convertible - Mr. 17.
red paint transfer from the convertible.
knocking him off-course and into the light pole.
the driver was ejected. No seat belt.
James Marshall, 20's, college kid.
second DUl this year.
he was working on this third here.
Yeah, he got more than a hangover this time.
well, this boy cracked his egg wide open.
what about our truck driver?
okay, so the truck hits the convertible, rolls on its side.
leaving the driver speechless.
all right, fellas, we got a math problem here.
never very good at math.
we got three dead drivers, right? - Right.
all with their brains still inside their heads. - Yeah. So?
what's this brain doing down here?
this is going to be fun.
you must be Charlie.
sorry. I was just...
no, no, no, no, it's all good.
I'm Nick Stokes. It's nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.
you're the same guy that's the starting point guard at WLVU, right? - Yeah.
nice work.
are you, uh, are you here for a family meeting?
dad's talked about our family meetings?
well, they've been pretty much dialed into the curriculum around here.
so is he serious about raising your hand?
not anymore. No, we had a family meeting about that.
Hey, look who's here. Hey, buddy.
you met my son. Pretty cool, huh?
what are you doing here? I thought the bus to Tempe was leaving at 2: 00.
Yeah, it did.
Oh, you have a game tonight?
which clearly you're not going to make.
I tell you what - Mr. Russell, if you would call me after you've read that.
it's the DMV records on all our vics.
Clegg's the only one with a rap sheet.
it's good to meet you, Charlie.
Hey, I really look forward to seeing you light it up, man.
Thanks. - All right.
all right. Talk to me.
I missed curfew last night by, like, five minutes.
coach suspended me for a game. It's stupid.
what's stupid? You broke a rule.
technically, but Coach is a lot different now that I'm recruited.
he's a little Mussolini.
Yeah, but the rules didn't change, did they?
all right.
stop by the house tonight and we'll talk it through, okay?
Hey, just for the record, exactly how long is "like five minutes"?
three hours, give or take.
got a cooler here.
maybe Clegg was drinking and driving.
maybe.
no booze.
I don't know about drinking and driving.
more like thinking and driving.
got some brain matter here.
looks like Clegg might have been transporting our mystery brain.
you know, he could be working for a medical company or something like that.
well, he was definitely into medicine, but I wouldn't trust him to drive my brain around.
yeah? Why's that?
oxy.
I got a duffle bag.
guy liked to work out.
he was into other lifting, too.
got a burglary tool.
starting to get a picture of this Clegg guy.
Yeah, me, too.
there's some yellow powder on the crowbar.
got some yellow powder in the bag, too.
I have seen crappy cocaine that color.
I've never seen a drug addict waste this much product.
you know, we are down one body.
trunk's where I'd hide it.
Yeah, pop it for me, will you?
Pigskin?
that's it?
you know, this is strange. - Why?
I'm starting to think Russell's a psychic.
how come?
Well,'cause he asked what Clegg ordered at the drive-thru window.
it was a number 17.
or it's a coincidence, maybe.
he hadn't opened the trunk yet.
the police have arrived. Thank God.
you... you have fun at work, don't you?
some people are visual, others are audio.
I just happen to be both- audio-visual.
I like to process the entire experience.
so the tire truck smacks into the convertible, the convertible clips the Jeep, and hello, light poSt.
I have a theory about that.
okay, so the brain is riding shotgun in the cooler.
car gets smashed by the truck.
cooler gets slammed up against the door- doonk- and out pops our magical mystery brain.
it's only defense was to roll under a tire.
Hey, Russ, I found this football in Clegg's trunk.
it's got a number 17 on it.
I'll be damned. Look at that.
how'd you know that?
what color is the horse?
Really? No, it's a famous story.
a traffic accident near a ranch, right?
several cars and a horse are involved.
the horse is severely injured and the officer at the scene wants to put him out of his misery with his. 357.
unfortunately, the bullet ricochets off the horse's skull and hits an officer standing nearby.
kills him dead as a doornail.
and when this is all reported to the chief, the only question he asks,"What color's the horse?"
there were seasoned investigators all over that scene for hours, taking notes, gathering evidence
but nobody noted the color of the horse.
if you miss one small detail, then who knows what else you've missed.
cause you never know what's important.
cool story, huh?
that is a good story.
looks like Mr. Clegg swallowed a couple oxycodones antemortem.
Sara did find drugs in is car.
he's got a lot of track marks. Clegg here was a junkie.
looks like chicken nuggets.
takes two to four hours for food to clear the stomach.
this guy binged on fast food before he ordered more.
equal opportunity junkie.
junkie being the operative word.
I don't think Mr. Clegg died as a result of the accident.
frothy edematous lungs, pills, track marks - looks like an O. D.
so, where are we going to do about the brain-topsy?
to the scale, Ms. Brody.
weigh it.
cool.
3. 4 pounds.
that's heavy-ish.
a female brain tips the scales at probably 2. 8-ish.
average male brain weighs just over three pounds.
average female just under.
so this brain's a boy.
DNA confirmed it. Didn't help us any making the I. D.
Hello, Brain Doe.
so what's next?
check it for freshness, see if there are any signs of decomp.
blood vessels still look fairly red.
go ahead, poke it.
that's it.
feels like Jell-O.
it's unfixed. No grossing or formalin present.
means it was extracted within the last 24 hours.
incision is precise, brain stem's been cut clean.
skillfully removed.
cutter was a pro.
maybe a research specimen?
no way.
specimens are immediately fixed in formaldehyde.
that's even more awesome.
we might be talking about black market brains.
Thanks, Doc. This has been fun.
is it just me or are defense attorneys getting smarter?
No! Slimier!
don't worry, we still have the truth on our side.
I still don't like that guy.
there was nothing wrong with my evidence collection.
at least he didn't ask you if it was Dr. Willows.
coming or going?
we are just returning from court, Sheriff.
Sanders, you look like you could use a cup of coffee.
nice seeing you, too, Sheriff.
you in the neighborhood?
not really.
so, um... how are things going?
no complaints.
really. I'd complain.
you were a supervisor, now you're not.
no advancement on the horizon.
I'd be pissed.
I work with some good people.
it takes the sting off.
well, maybe I can do a little better than that.
I've been spending a lot of time on the Hill.
senate Judiciary Committee is exploring establishing a Forensic Science Commission.
they need a full time staffer, expert in the field.
I recommended you.
I hope you're good with that.
I don't know what to say.
do you really want to be processing used condoms and dirty panties the rest of your career?
go to D. C.
pay's good, the hours are great.
you get to travel.
sometimes you have to move out to move up.
if you're interested, don't take too long.
thank you, Sheriff.
thank you. I appreciate the confidence.
it's not easy for us. Not in law enforcement.
it's a... man's world.
sheriff.
you here on business?
always.
everything all right?
Yeah. Why wouldn't it be?
no reason. No reason at all.
um, just got a call-out. A 406 at a mortuary.
and you're gonna love this part... comes with an NRS 200. 033.
I have no idea what the hell that is.
you ever seen so many numbers in a sentence before?
is this an assignment or an observation?
uh, yeah. Sorry. Both.
okay. Got it.
only two brains were transported in the last 24 hours.
one belonged to Nora Babbit, 77, Alzheimer's patient.
her brain went to WLVU Center for Gerontology.
and the other one?
Ryan Dempsey, 42, suicide.
his brain went to St. Sebastian's.
being studied for repetitive trauma.
so both the packages arrived?
safe and unsound.
that's what I call a dead end.
Hi, Lou.
you okay?
why does everybody keep asking me that? - Okay...
lieutenant Theodore Seligson, 30. On leave from Afghanistan.
cutting trees in his backyard. He fell and he broke his neck.
guy survived the war... - Yeah.
family's Jewish. Now, they had to get him in the ground by this morning.
someone is supposed to remain with the body, but the mortuary night guy stayed with his girlfriend last night instead.
came in this morning, and he called it in.
that was Mrs. Seligson, the widow.
she came by as soon as she heard.
how bad is it?
you need to see for yourself.
I didn't think corpses bled.
embalming is considered desecration.
Oh, really?
what about cutting a guy's head open and taking his brain?
this guy was a war hero.
I heard you guys found a brain outside a Tasty Time.
that's gotta be his, right?
well, it better be. Otherwise, we got a brain collector on the loose in Vegas.
heard you could use a little help. - Yeah, thanks.
our mortuary owner said that when they close at 10: 00, the last thing they do is mop the floors.
these impressions have got to belong to our brain thief.
you haven't heard. - Heard what?
Henry ran the DNA of our mystery brain against Lieutenant Seligson's DNA in the military database.
no match?
somebody breaks into a mortuary and steals a brain.
meanwhile, across town, another brain flies out of a convertible during a TC.
I mean, what are the odds?
the two events have to be related.
this powder here says that they are.
Nick and I processed Clegg's car. We found a crowbar and yellow powder that looked like this.
so Clegg is the connection.
maybe.
Hodges. I'm sending you a photo of a shoe impression.
I need you to compare it to our convertible driver Clegg's shoes.
coming at you.
perfect match.
clegg was definitely at the mortuary.
and he'd been there before. Clegg's employment records.
guy held down a half-dozen odd jobs, including grave-shift body pickups for mortuaries across town.
his tox panel - serious drug cocktail. Positive for oxycodone, fentanyl and DMT.
what's DMT? I don't know that.
it's found in certain herbs.
creates a super-intense high that only lasts about two minutes- instant painkiller.
okay, so, Clegg was intensely high at both scenes - the brain snatching and the traffic accident.
but somewhere in between, Seligson's brain is magically replaced with our mystery brain - how?
well, we know the timeline.
clegg stole Seligson's brain sometime after 10: 00 p. m. when he hit the mortuary, and sometime before 3: 00 a. m.when he hit the drive-thru.
with a new brain.
so... oh, Lord.
um, all right, so...
who's our mystery brain belong to, and where did Lt. Seligson's go?
chicken nuggets.
sorry?
doc found partially digested chicken nuggets in Clegg's stomach
that means he got some junk food at least two to three hours before he O. D'd.
okay, so, Clegg nuggeted up around midnight.
maybe he switched brains then.
well, if he did get the urge, then the best place to go would be Tasty Time.
maybe that's where he nuggeted up.
so somebody needs to find out how many Tasty Times there are in Vegas.
Twenty-two. - Really?
I know it seems like a lot.
at times, it feels like it's not enough.
let's pull surveillance from all of them.
let's just take Clegg's car for a spin, shall we?
Wow...this guy always ordered chicken nuggets.
not true. He ordered a number 17 triple cheeseburger deluxe right before he died.
yeah? Well, see what happens when you break pattern?
Oh, wait. Got it.
tasty Time on Altos Boulevard.
11: 53 p. m. last night.
Oh, and guess what he ordered? Nuggets.
Clegg's car.
he's meeting somebody.
think he's going to share his nuggets?
I think he's swapping brains.
explains how Clegg ended up with our mystery brain.
volvo driver gets Seligson's.
punch in on the plate.
volvo's registered to a Dr. Hanson Eller.
Seneca address.
Eller is a private pathologiSt. Man would know how to remove a brain.
maybe he took out our mystery brain.
wait a second - Seneca.
two brains were transported for research. One of them was a suicide from Seneca.
here it is - the brain belonged to Ryan Dempsey.
Vegas local... he also had a cabin in Seneca.
the death certificate was signed by our pathologist, Dr. Hanson Eller.
guy's a licensed doctor.
what's he doing swapping brains at midnight in a Tasty Time parking lot?
I'll call Brass, have him put a broadcast out on Eller.
somebody should break the news to the Dempsey family.
you're wrong.
my husband's instructions were very specific.
and I got a call from St. Sebastian's this morning.
his brain arrived.
Yeah. A brain arrived.
we don't believe that it was your husband's.
well, how could that be?
well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
did your husband donate all of his organs to research?
no, just his brain.
Ryan... thought he had C. T.E.
chronic Traumatic Encephalitis.
my husband was a mixed marital arts fighter.
if you've ever seen an S. F.F. match, you know the beatings those guys take.
Ryan took a lot of hits over the years.
concussions.
but he always fought through it.
said he was doing it for us.
a year ago, he started having problems with his memory.
you know, he'd get confused... upset...
and when he got upset, he...
things could get bad.
Hey, kid.
you're Declan, right? Ryan Dempsey's boy.
I'm Jim Brass.
I heard about your dad.
and you're sorry for my loss?
Yeah, I am.
the thing about CTE is they don't know if you have it until after you're dead.
you know, they-they study your brain.
even killing himself, all he could think about was making sure his brain could be studied.
how crazy is that?
I'm sorry to ask you this, Mrs. Dempsey, but can you walk me through what happened right after the suicide?
it was the worst night of my life.
my son and I had been out hiking.
Ryan wasn't feeling well.
and when we got back to the cabin...
we found him.
I didn't know what to do, so I called um... a family friend.
who was that?
it was Ryan's trainer, Bill Pernin.
he made the arrangements? He called the pathologist, Dr. Eller?
I... I suppose so.
did you talk with Dr. Eller?
the man who was going to remove my husband's brain?
I didn't care to meet him.
no, of course not.
did you get along with your Dad?
you get along with yours?
no. Took a belt to me.
tough.
he was a cop, too.
he was not a happy guy.
I was, like, 15 before I had the balls to belt him back.
I popped him in the jaw.
I could tell it hurt, too.
never felt better, I never felt worse.
how 'bout your Mom? She get along with your Dad?
let's go, Deck.
wife had bruising.
Yeah, the kid's awfully quiet.
I'll do some checking. See if there were any domestic violence calls.
call Seneca P. D. They had a family cabin up there.
vacations can be stressful.
I wouldn't know.
hold on.
where?
okay, lock it down till we get there.
Dr. Eller's car just showed up.
I'll send Nick.
what do we know? - Security heard shots fired less than 30 minutes ago.
no surveillance. - Yeah, and no witnesses.
found the vehicle just like this, backed into the space with the windows down.
hm, looks like a meet.
Yeah, and it wasn't his firSt. We got him on tape at Tasty Time trading brains with Clegg.
it's a single GSW to the left temple through and through.
bullet's in the headliner.
slight upward angle.
Now...unless the shooter's four feet tall...
the car pulled up right alongside of him, right here.
dips out of the driver's-side window and bam!
nine millimeter.
we know Eller and Clegg had some kind of business arrangement.
well, maybe some third party wanted a share of their brain game.
Yeah, a silent partner.
who silenced Eller.
Dr. Eller delivered this brain to the hospital under the name Ryan Dempsey.
but DNA has confirmed that the brain is not Dempsey's.
in fact, it's Lieutenant Seligson's.
couldn't pick him out in a crowd.
I beg to differ.
care to elaborate?
take a look at that butchered brain stem.
this brain's a hack job.
but Dempsey's brain, the one they found at the accident, was surgically removed by a qualified surgeon.
hack job on Lieutenant Seligson's brain suggests that the cuts were made in a hurry, maybe even improvised.
which can only mean one thing...
so you're saying that somebody wanted a brain in a hurry, so they broke into the mortuary and hacked out Lieutenant Seligson's?
Ryan Dempsey commits suicide.
he's convinced he's got a degenerative brain disorder, so he donates his brain to science.
but Clegg swaps it out so it can't be studied.
giving him a brain upgrade in the process.
upgrade?
that's why Clegg chose Seligson's brain.
lieutenant Seligson was Jewish.
and Jewish tradition says a body can't be embalmed.
preferably it goes in the ground within 24 hours.
so, the Lieutenant's brain was fresh.
just what St. Sebastian's was expecting.
a perfect specimen. No chemicals, no decomp.
no brain disease.
okay, so Ryan Dempsey wanted to have his brain studied 'cause he was afraid he had CTE and he wanted the truth to come out.
and clearly someone else didn't.
someone who was willing to grave rob, brain swap and pop a pathologist to cover it all up.
the silent partner.
Hodges, what are you doing?
um, it's a break room. I'm on a break.
you know chickens' nuggets don't really look like that, right?
please don't ruin my lunch. - Fine.
uh, yellow powder trace? Give.
receive.
you know, I've been trying to text you for over an hour.
talcum powder.
in Clegg's duffel bag, on the crowbar, at the mortuary.
in my report, powder's made with a special formulation with five essential oils, used in high-end gyms, including my own.
you go to the gym?
under this shirt... ripped.
Oh, I-I believe you.
page four - it's a list of gyms.
not even real chicken in there.
Ryan Dempsey. "The Man Without Fear."
pretty good record: 52 and nine.
Ooh, that looks like one of the nine.
Yeah, and that... looks like Danny Clegg.
the guy that had Dempsey's brain in his convertible?
they knew each other. They were in the S. F.F. together.
they trained together until Clegg got kicked out of the league for drugs.
well, that powder in Clegg's gym bag was a specific type of talc used at certain gyms.
"bill Pernin's Power Center. " It's on the liSt.
Dempsey's widow said Bill Pernin was his trainer.
and he's the family friend who made arrangements for Dempsey's brain.
Yeah, that connects him to Dempsey, Clegg and Dr. Eller.
Pernin just signed a multi-million-dollar deal with Real Fuel?
one of his fighters turning up with CTE cannot be good for advertising.
bill Pernin? - Yeah. Can I help you?
you got a minute?
Yeah.
let me guess, you two are here about the Real Fuel Couple's Boot Camp, huh?
Ah, it's gonna be a terrific weekend.
Sara Sidle. Greg Sanders. We're with the Crime Lab.
can we talk somewhere out of the way?
nice facility.
Oh, thanks, man. It's my dream.
you know, 20 years of blood, sweat and tears.
so, uh, what's up?
you guys aren't here to hit the heavy bag. What's going on?
we're here about Dr. Hanson Eller.
the, uh, pathologiSt. Yeah, he used to train at my old gym.
you hired him to remove your friend Ryan Dempsey's brain?
Yeah, yeah, that's right. His wife asked me to help with the funeral arrangements.
I don't think those were the arrangements that she had in mind.
what are you talking about?
we're talking about how your friend Ryan Dempsey's brain ended up in your other friend Danny Clegg's cooler.
okay... look, I'm still t following you.
Eller, Dempsey, Clegg, the only thing these three guys had in common, other than your training, is that they're all dead.
look, if something happened to Danny Clegg and Dr. Eller, that's news to me.
when's the last time you saw them?
I haven't seen Danny in months.
poor guy was a junkie. I had to toss him out of here.
and Dr. Eller, the last time we saw each other, I was crying over my friend's body.
if you'll excuse me, I got about three different meetings that I'm late for.
so if you need me, my number's on the wall.
other than that, great meeting you.
would you buy a membership off that guy?
not a lifetime one.
well, I don't think I am overreacting.
Yeah, he lied to his coach, then he lied to me.
it's not just about basketball. It's about life.
Yeah, you say that whenever you're trying to get off the phone, so I'm gonna get off the phone firSt.
I love you, too.
you rang?
Yeah. I ran my theory on the domestic troubles with the Dempseys.
came up empty.
you didn't call me over here just to tell me that... did you?
no. Look at these.
these are photos of Ryan Dempsey's suicide. Gun on the floor.
half a bottle of bourbon in front of him.
it took the investigator just 20 minutes to call it.
do you see what I don't see? - Yeah, I do.
no gunshot residue on the guy's T-shirt.
gun had to be at least three feet away.
that's pretty tricky for a suicide.
even a 36-inch sleeve couldn't pull that off.
Ryan Dempsey was murdered.
all right, let's start by getting our own brains straight.
now that the smoke and tires have cleared, what do we know- really know- for sure.
well, we've got Ryan Dempsey, an S. F.F. fighter murdered, staged to look like a suicide.
cops found a. 38 special near the body with Dempsey's prints on it.
per his will, Dempsey's brain was on its way to being studied for CTE.
except somebody intercepted it and substituted another healthy brain.
enlisting Danny Clegg, who O. D.'d.
and Doc Eller, who was shot to death.
Why? I mean, let's say that the brain did get to where it's supposed to go.
it was studied and Dempsey had CTE.
so what? Wouldn't that be on him?
Pernin would still not want to have been associated with that.
Yeah, but enough to kill for?
maybe Dempsey's brain's hiding another secret?
keep going.
well, according to Clegg's tox panel, he O. D.'d on quite the drug cocktail, including DMT, right?
the instant painkiller.
Yeah, maybe the perfect lift to get him through a tough fight.
Pernin could be doping his fighters.
now, that might be worth covering up.
and also worth killing for.
you know something? I bet that Dempsey's brain might corroborate all of this, if we could just get it to pee in a cup.
am I supposed to know what this is?
well, you have a medical background. - Yeah, in sports medicine.
you know what DMT is?
schedule One drug - they don't test for that in the S. F.F.
this report tells us that Ryan Dempsey was taking DMT, as was Danny Clegg.
although I suspect that Clegg was suing it recreationally.
a little bump from his old trainer for doing him a solid.
why, why am I here, exactly?
well, you made a phone call to Danny Clegg the night that Dempsey died.
Yeah, Clegg is an old friend of mine. I got his number in my phone.
pocket dial. What do you want?
Oh, you pocket dialing the Dempsey home for the last four months, too?
exactly. So why were you calling when Ryan was at the gym?
his wife was not hard on the eyes. Were you tuning her up, too?
and Dempsey found out about it, right?
why'd you do this to me? - See the doctor...
you didn't think I'd find out?! - Stop it...!
the guy has CTE. There's only one way that's going to end.
a gun is a great equalizer.
Joyce Dempsey called you right after.
according to the phone records, you were still in Vegas.
two hours after that, you made a call to Dr. Eller and then 911 from Seneca.
you cleaned up the mess your girlfriend made, got your stories straight, and made arrangements.
now I get to make another call.
as a matter of fact, I do.
trying to soften me up, are you?
is it working? - No.
your coach called me this afternoon. He's worried about you.
he's worried about winning.
well, he's supposed to, Charlie. He's the coach.
so why did you miss curfew?
I was bouldering up at Mt. Charleston.
lost track of time. It was stupid.
I don't care what you were doing. I want to know why, Charlie.
it's just... the other players don't really get me.
it's different here, Dad.
Hey, you're the new kid on the team. Everybody thinks you're a little weird. Right?
well, join the club.
we are weird.
are you still having fun with basketball?
I love it.
good.
apologize to your coach... take your suspension with a smile.
and, next game, you bring it.
can you do that?
Yeah, I can do that.
good.
Hey, come here for a second, will you?
I promise, I promise, no more stories.
okay, what's up? - This is driving me crazy.
now why did Clegg order a number 17?
right? He was a nugget man.
he's high on drugs - he should have been thirsty, if anything.
well, you know what's driving me nuts? - What?
football. - Why?
cause I played a little football. I even got a game ball once.
they put my jersey number on it and everything.
and I still have that football; it's very important to me.
maybe this is Clegg's game ball, right?
and he hung on to it, and his life is passing before his eyes.
he starts thinking about the good times.
I don't know, man. I read Clegg's bio.
he didn't even play football.
Yeah, but Dempsey did.
maybe Dempsey gave Clegg his ball. - Why?
I don't - I don't know, man. Because they were good friends, I guess.
wait, wait, go back.
all right, so Clegg is supposed to be getting rid of his friend's brain for Pernin, right?
but three hours after the swap, he's still driving around with it.
maybe he's driving around with his friend's game ball for the same reason that he's driving around with his brain.
maybe he's not trying to help Pernin. Maybe he's trying to help his old friend.
you know what? There's a police station about - about two blocks from the Tasty Time.
I'll bet you anything that he was going to bust Pernin for drugs, and he died firSt. Right?
wait - whoa, what are you doing?
I think it's about time to figure out how this football plays into all this, don't you?
Yeah, what the hell. Go for it.
hold on.
I guess you never really know what's important.
print on the syringe got us a warrant to Pernin's house.
found this in his sock drawer.
let's see if his bullet matches the one that killed Eller.
fire one.
nice.
so we've got him dead to rights on the Eller murder.
but he won't flip on Joyce Dempsey.
well, I guess he has a large capacity for love.
Joyce Dempsey's one lucky woman.
want me to take a pass with the kid?
I got this one.
everybody, I'd like a little privacy.
thank you very much.
so remember when I told you I took a swing at my dad and I never felt better and never felt worse?
well, the better lasted, like, 15 seconds.
the worse... 40 years, and counting.
no one in this life is all good or all bad.
even my dad had a lot of good in him.
and I know you had a lot of good times with your dad, too.
now you got to try and help that dad.
the one who loved you.
did your dad and mom have a fight at the cabin about Mr. Pernin?
they were always fighting.
Yeah, but this time your mom fought with a gun, right?
come on, Deck... remember the good.
there were no good times.
all I can remember is being scared.
well, I'm sure your mom was scared, too.
he threw me down the stairs.
you didn't think I'd find out? Everyone knows!
he was choking my mom and screaming and calling her names.
but I couldn't stop him.
and I know you think my mom did it...
look, don't say another word.
I killed him.
Declan, no!
and, really, I've never felt better.
good morning. -Good morning.
here ye, here ye, 1 0 minutes to go till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.
watch it!
it's a beautiful day -It's a rather nice day
a day for a glorious wedding
a rehearsal, my dear to be perfectly clear
a rehearsal for a glorious wedding
assuming nothing happens that we don 't really know
that nothing unexpected interferes with the show
and that's why everything every last little thing
every single, tiny, microscopic little thing must go -According to plan -Our son will be married -According to plan -Our family carried
elevated to the heights of society -To the costume balls -In the hallowed halls
rubbing elbows with the finest
having crumpets with Her Highness
we'll be there, we'll be seen having tea with the queen
we'll forget everything that we 've ever, ever been -Blimey! It's my dress is caught. -Begging your pardon, Ma' am.
come on, dear. -It's not me. It's my dress is caught.
where is Victor? We might be late.
fish merchants.
it's a terrible day -Now, don 't be that way
it's a terrible day for a wedding
it's a sad, sad state of affairs we're in
that has led to this ominous wedding
how could our family have come to this?
to marry off our daughter to the nouveau riche -They're so common -So coarse -Oh, it couldn 't be worse -Couldn 't be worse? I'm afraid I disagree
they could be land-rich, Bankrupt aristocracy
without a penny to their name
just like you and me
Oh, dear.
and that's why everything every last little thing
every single, tiny, microscopic little thing Must go -According to plan -Our daughter will wed -According to plan -Our family led
from the depths of deepest poverty -To the noble realm -Of our ancestry
and who would have guessed in a million years -That our daughter with a face -Of an otter in disgrace
would provide our ticket to a rightful place
Oh, Hildegarde.
what if Victor and l don't like each other?
as if that has anything to do with marriage.
do you suppose your father and l like each other?
surely you must a little?
of course not. -Of course not.
get those corsets laced properly.
I can hear you speak without gasping.
you've certainly hooked a winner this time, Victor.
now, all you have to do is reel her in. -I'm already reeling, Mother.
shouldn't Victoria Everglot be marrying a lord or something?
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit as good as the Everglots.
I always knew I deserved better than a fish merchant's life.
but I've never even spoken to her.
well, at least we have that in our favor.
Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.
marriage is a partnership, a little tit for tat.
you'd think a lifetime watching us...
might have taught her that -Might have taught her that -Everything must be perfect -Everything must be perfect -Everything must be perfect
perfect that's why everything
every last little thing
every single, tiny, microscopic little thing must go
according to plan
look at the way you're standing.
you look like you got rickets or something...
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur! Such impeccable taste!
Oh, beautiful, innit?
it's not as big as our place, dear.
bit shabby really, isn't it? -Shut up.
lord and Lady Everglot...
...Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.
why, you must be Miss Victoria.
Yes, I must say, you don't look a day over 20. No. Oh, yes.
smile, darling, smile.
well, hello. What a pleasure. Welcome to our home.
thank you.
we'll be taking tea in the west drawing room.
Oh, do come this way, it's just through there.
Oh, I love what you've done with the place. Who is your decorator?
nice tiles, shame about the drapes.
my husband says such foolish things. Ignore him.
Yes, it's usually best.
do forgive me. -You play beautifully.
I-- l-- I do apologize, Miss Everglot. How rude of me to-- Well...
excuse me.
mother won't let me near the piano.
music is improper for a young lady.
too passionate, she says.
if I may ask, Miss Everglot...
...where is your chaperon?
perhaps, in-- In view of the circumstances...
...you could call me Victoria.
Yes, of course. Well...
Victoria... -Yes, Victor.
tomorrow, we are to be m
m-- M
married. -Yes. Married.
since I was a child, I've-- I've dreamt of my wedding day.
I always hoped to find someone I was deeply in love with.
someone to spend the rest of my life with.
silly, isn't it? -Yes, silly.
no. No, not at all, no.
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
what impropriety is this?
you shouldn't be alone together.
here it is, one minute before 5, and you're not at the rehearsal.
pastor Galswells is waiting. Come at once.
master Van Dort, from the beginning. Again.
with this hand, I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine.
with this candle, I will light your way in darkness.
with this ring, I ask you to be mine.
let's try it again. -Yes. Yes, sir.
with this candle...
this candle...
this candle.
shall I get up there and do it for him? -Don't get all aflutter, dear.
with this candle...
continue!
get the door, Emil.
let's just pick it up at the candle bit.
a Lord Barkis, sir.
I haven't a head for dates.
apparently, I'm a day early for the ceremony.
ls he from your side of the family? -I can't recall.
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.
do carry on.
let's try it again, shall we, Master Van Dort?
Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly. -Right.
right. Oh, right!
with this... This-- -Hand.
with this hand...
...I-- With
three steps, three!
can you not count? Do you not wish to be married, Master Van Dort?
No! No. -You do not?
No! I meant, no, I do not not wish to be married.
that is, I want very much to
pay attention! Have you even remembered to bring the ring?
the ring? Yes. Of course.
dropping the ring. -Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!
this boy doesn't want to get married. -How disgraceful!
excuse me. Got it!
out of the way, you ninny.
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on, there's a woman on fire! Help! Emergency!
Oh, I hope it doesn't stain. -Stop fanning it, you fool.
get a bucket, get a bucket. -I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!
enough! This wedding cannot take place until he is properly prepared.
young man, learn your vows.
well, he's quite the catch, isn't he?
Oh, Victoria.
she must think I'm such a fool. This day couldn't get any worse.
hear ye, hear ye! Rehearsal in ruins as Van Dort boy causes chaos!
fishy fiance could be canned!
Everglots all fired up as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!
it really shouldn't be all that difficult.
it's just a few simple vows.
with this hand, I will take your wine.
no.
with this hand...
...I will cup your
Oh, goodness, no.
with this...
with this...
with this candle, I will...
I will...
I will set your mother on fire.
Oh, it's no use.
with this hand, I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine.
Mrs. Everglot.
you look ravishing this evening.
what's that, Mr. Everglot? Call you " Dad"? If you insist, sir.
with this candle, I will light your way in darkness.
with this ring...
...I ask you to be mine.
I do.
you may kiss the bride.
a new arrival. -He must've fainted.
are you all right? -What--? What happened?
by Jove, man. Looks like we've got ourselves a breather.
does he have a dead brother? -He's still soft.
a toast, then.
to the newlyweds.
newlyweds?
in the woods, you said your vows so perfectly.
I did?
I did.
wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
coming through, coming through.
my name is Paul, I am the head waiter.
I will be creating your wedding feast.
wedding feast! I'm salivating.
maggots.
keep away!
I've got a-- I've got a dwarf.
and I'm not afraid to use him. I want some questions. Now!
answers. I think you mean "answers." -Thank you, yes, answers.
I need answers. What's going on here? Where am l?
who are you?
well, that's kind of a long story.
what a story it is.
a tragic tale of romance, passion...
...and murder most foul.
this is gonna be good.
hit it, boys.
Hey, give me a listen you corpses of cheer
at least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story Make a skeleton cry of our own jubiliciously lovely Corpse Bride
die, die, we all pass away
but don 't wear a frown because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
that's right.
well, our girl was a beauty known for miles around
when a mysterious stranger came into town
he was plenty good-looking but down on his cash
and our poor little baby she fell hard and fast
when her daddy said no she just couldn 't cope
so our lovers came up with a plan to elope
die, die, we all pass away
but don 't wear a frown because it's really okay
you might try and hide and you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
that's right.
okay. Oh, yeah. Come on, boys, pick it up.
Yeah. Like it.
okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah.
Yeah!
that's nice.
so they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
they told not a soul kept the whole thing tight
now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
you don 't need much When you're really in love
except for a few things or so I'm told
like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
on a dark foggy night at a quarter to 3
she was ready to go but where was he?
and then?
she waited -And then?
there in the shadows, was it her man? -And then?
her little heart beat so loud -And then?
and then, baby, everything went black
now, when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
so she made a vow lying under that tree
that she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
then out of the blue comes this groovy young man
who vows forever to be by her side
and that's the story of our Corpse Bride
die, die, we all pass away
but don 't wear a frown, because it's really okay
you might try and hide And you might try and pray
but we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah.
Victoria, come away from the window.
Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly.
he's terrified of the dark. In fact, when he was a boy...
...he used to wet his combinations regularly, didn't he, William?
enter.
lord Barkis. I trust the room is to your liking.
thank you, you are a most gracious hostess.
which is why it pains me to be the bearer of such bad news.
would you care to repeat tonight's headline for us?
hear ye, hear ye!
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!
the dark-haired temptress and Master Van Dort slipped away into the night!
and now, the weather. Scattered showers
enough! That will be all.
mystery woman? He doesn't even know any women!
or so you thought.
do call for me if you need my assistance...
...in any way.
good heavens, Finis, what should we do?
fetch me musket.
William, do something.
the town crier probably just had a slow news day.
you know how it is, you need a little something to cry about.
regardless, we are one groom short for the wedding tomorrow.
not to mention the financial implications.
a most scandalous embarrassment for us all.
Oh, give us a chance to find him, we beg of you.
just give us until dawn. -Very well. Till dawn.
Victor, darling, where are you?
if you ask me, your boyfriend is kind of jumpy.
he's not my boyfriend, he's my husband.
Victor, where have you gone?
I'll keep an eye out for him.
Victor?
there he goes, there he goes! He's-- He's getting away!
quick, quick, after him!
Victor.
thank you.
Victor!
where are you?
Victor?
where have you gone?
married, huh? I'm a widow.
Oh, how rude. He went that way!
Victor.
Victor, darling.
please. There's been a mistake. I'm not dead.
excuse me. Excuse me.
excuse me. -Excuse me.
thank you. -Thank you.
Victor.
dead end. -Victor!
Hello!
could have used the stairs, silly.
isn't the view beautiful? It takes my breath away.
well, it would if I had any.
isn't it romantic?
look, I am terribly sorry about what's happened to you...
...and I'd like to help, but I really need to get home.
this is your home now. -But I don't even know your name.
well, that's a great way to start a marriage.
shut up!
it's Emily. -Emily.
Oh, I almost forgot. I have something for you.
it's a wedding present.
thank you.
scraps?
Scraps!
my dog, Scraps!
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.
I knew you'd be happy to see him.
who's my good boy? Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.
good boy, Scraps. Roll over. Roll over.
good boy, Scraps. Play dead.
sorry.
Oh, what a cutie.
you should have seen him with fur.
mother never approved of Scraps jumping up like this.
but then again, she never approved of anything.
do you think she would have approved of me?
you're lucky you'll never have to meet her.
well, actually...
...now that you mention it, I think you should.
in fact, since we're, you know...
...Married, you should definitely meet her.
and my father too. We should go and see them right now.
what a fantastic idea! Where are they buried?
what? What is it? -They're not from around here.
where are they?
Oh, they're still alive.
I'm afraid so. -Well, that is a problem.
what's that, Scraps?
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.
Oh, well, if you put it like that. -What?
elder Gutknecht.
scraps.
elder Gutknecht...
...are you there?
Hello? Is anyone home?
Hello?
there you are!
Oh, my dear. There you are.
I've brought my husband, Victor.
what's that? Husband?
pleasure to meet you, sir.
we need to go up. Upstairs? To visit the land of the living.
land of the living?
Oh, my dear.
please, Elder Gutknecht.
now, why go up there, when people are dying to get down here?
sir, I beg you to help. It means so much to me
us. -I don't know, it's just not natural.
please, Elder Gutknecht.
surely there must be something you can do.
let me see what I can do.
where did I put that book?
I left it here somewhere.
there's the one.
I have it.
a Ukrainian haunting spell. Just the thing for these quick trips.
so glad you thought of this. -Me too.
now, then...
...where were we?
the Ukrainian haunting spell?
here we have it. Ready?
just remember, when you want to come back, say "Hopscotch."
hopscotch? -That's it.
I spent so long in the darkness...
...I'd almost forgotten how beautiful the moonlight is.
Hey, I think you dropped something.
hold on, hold on.
I think I should prepare Mother and Father for the big news.
I'll go ahead and you...
...Wait here.
perfect. -I won't be long.
stay right here. I'll be right back.
okay.
no peeking.
if ever I see that Van Dort boy...
...I'll strangle him with my bare hands.
your hands are too fat, and his neck is too thin.
you'll have to use a rope.
this is the voice of your conscience. Listen to what I say.
I have a bad feeling about that boy. You know he is no
go chew someone else's ear for a while.
Victor has gone to see his parents, just like he said.
if I hadn't just been sitting in it, I would say that you had lost your mind!
I'm sure he has a perfectly good reason for taking so long.
I am sure he does. Why don't you go ask him?
all right, I will.
after all, he couldn't get far with those cold feet.
Victoria. -Victor? I'm so happy to see you.
come by the fire. Where have you been? Are you all right?
I-- l
Oh, dear.
you're as cold as death. What's happened to you?
your coat.
Victoria, I confess.
this morning I was terrified of marriage.
but then, on meeting you, I felt I should be with you always...
...and that our wedding could not come soon enough.
Victor, I feel the same.
Victoria, I se-- I se
I seem to find myself married.
and you should know it's unexpected.
my darling, I just wanted to meet
darling? Who's this?
who is she? -I'm his wife.
Victor? -Victoria, wait. You don't understand.
she's dead. Look.
hopscotch.
No! No! Victoria!
you lied to me!
just to get back to that other woman.
don't you understand? You're the other woman.
No! You're married to me. She's the other woman.
she's got a point.
and I thought... I thought this was all going so well.
look, I'm sorry, but...
...this just can't work.
why not?
it's my eye, isn't it?
no. Your eye is Iovely.
listen, under different circumstances, well, who knows?
but we're just too different. I mean, you're dead.
you should've thought about that before you asked me to marry you.
why can't you understand? It was a mistake. I would never marry you.
roses for eternal love.
lilies for sweetness.
baby's breath.
why so blue?
maybe he's right. Maybe we are too different.
maybe he should have his head examined.
I could do it.
or perhaps he does belong with her. Little Miss Living.
with her rosy cheeks and beating heart.
Oh, those girls are ten a penny. You've got so much more.
you've got-- You've got
you've got a wonderful personality.
what does that wispy little brat have that you don 't have double?
she can 't hold a candle to the beauty of your smile
how about a pulse?
overrated by a mile -Overvalued -Overblown
if he only knew the you that we know
and that silly little creature isn 't wearing his ring
and she doesn 't play piano or dance, or sing
no, she doesn 't compare -But she still breathes air -Who cares?
unimportant -Overrated -Overblown -If only he could see
how special you can be
if he only knew the you that we know
if I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain
if you cut me with a knife It's still the same
and I know her heart is beating
and I know that I am dead
yet the pain here that I feel
try and tell me it's not real
and it seems that I still have a tear to shed
the sole redeeming feature from that little creature
is that she's alive -Overrated -Overblown
everybody knows that's just a temporary state
which is cured very quickly When we meet our fate -Who cares? -Unimportant -Overrated -Overblown
if only he could see how special you can be
if he only knew The you that we know
if I touch a burning candle I can feel no pain
in the ice or in the sun It's all the same
yet I feel my heart is aching
though it doesn 't beat, it's breaking
and the pain here that I feel
try and tell me it's not real
I know that I am dead
yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed
it's true, Mother!
Victor is married to a dead woman.
I saw her. A corpse! Standing right here with Victor.
Victor was in your room?
I have to help him.
the scandal!
come sit in your chair, dearie. You're shaking like a leaf.
let Hilde fetch you a blanket.
fetch her a straitjacket! She's completely mad!
come, Hildegarde.
finis, come to bed at once.
what in heaven's name?
who could that be at this hour?
miss Everglot.
what are you doing here? You should be at home, prostrate with grief.
pastor Galswells, I have to ask you something.
this is most irregular. -Please, I beg of you.
you are the only one in the village who knows of what awaits beyond the grave.
a grim topic for a bride-to-be.
it is a bride I fear, which is why I must know:
can the living marry the dead?
what on earth are you speaking about?
please, it's Victor. He's married to a corpse.
he has a corpse bride!
there must be some way to undo what's been done.
I believe I know the thing to do.
come with me.
Victoria? Where are your corsets?
she's speaking in tongues. Of unholy alliances.
her mind has come undone, I fear.
it's not true! Let me go! Let me go!
thank you, Pastor Galswells. Thank you so very much.
take her to her room!
no, I'm telling the truth.
Victor needs my help.
Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?
mother, Father, please. -Seal the doors...
...and bar the windows. See to it that she doesn't escape again.
he needs our help! Oh, let me go! Let me go!
will the mortification never cease?
it will be years before we can show ourselves in public again.
what shall we do?
we shall continue as planned, with or without Vincent.
Victor. -Whatever.
for that boy to toss aside a young woman like Victoria...
...It's positively criminal.
why, if I had a woman like your daughter on my arm...
...I would lavish her with riches befitting royalty.
your lady wife is a most fortunate woman.
alas, I am not married.
I was betrothed some years ago...
...but tragedy snatched my young bride away.
when one lives alone, wealth counts for naught.
marvelous news, Victoria, there'll be a wedding after all.
you found him?
make haste, my dear, our relatives will arrive at any moment.
we must have you looking presentable for Lord Barkis.
lord Barkis?
he will make a fine husband.
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.
a far better prospect this time.
but I do not love him. You cannot make me do this.
we must. -Please, I beg of you.
there must be another way.
without your marriage to Lord Barkis...
...we shall be forced, penniless, into the street.
we are destitute.
but Victor...
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.
you shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.
according to plan. -According to plan.
Oh, my dear. Oh, don't look at me that way.
you have only to suffer this union until death do us part.
and that will come sooner than you think.
Oh, it's almost dawn! Where could he be?
Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!
heartbroken bride to wed wealthy newcomer!
wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.
did he say corpse?
Oh, don't be ridiculous. What corpse would marry our Victor?
Oh, Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.
mayhew, are you trying to kill us?
I think he's trying to kill us.
I...
...Think you dropped this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lied to you about wanting to see my parents.
it's just this whole day hasn't gone quite, well...
...According to plan.
pardon my enthusiasm.
I like your enthusiasm.
new arrival! New arrival! -Lights up!
hurry up, boys!
drinks for everyone.
another pint, sir?
no, no. Just a half. -No, no. Just a half.
it is impossible to get good help anymore.
welcoming committee, coming through! Coming through!
my name's Plum. Miss Plum. -Mayhew?
Mayhew! How nice to see
I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great.
hurry up, boys. Can you not see the gentleman is parched?
mayhew, I have to get back.
they all must be worried sick. How is everyone?
well, they're still wondering where you slipped off to.
Oh, and Miss Victoria...
yes? Yes, how is she?
well, she's getting married this evening.
what? Married to who?
some newcomer, Lord Somebody-or-Other.
but that's impossible!
Yeah, with you gone and all...
I guess they didn't wanna waste the cake.
but how could she?
women, you can't live with them.
you can't live with
time to pick up the pieces and-- You know, and move on, I suppose.
speaking of picking up the pieces?
Victor? Where are you going?
miss Victoria, we must leave for the church now.
yesterday I thought my wedding would be happy.
now I feel like I'm caught in the tide, pulled out to sea.
the sea leads to many places, dearie.
maybe you'll land somewhere better.
with this candle, I will light your way in darkness.
with this ring, I ask you to be mine.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Oh, oh, dear.
I'm too late.
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?
he just walked off without saying a word. Are all men like this?
well, I'm afraid none of them are very bright.
they get something stuck in their heads...
...and you can't do a thing with them.
my dear, we have to talk.
let me tell her, please. Let me tell her. -What?
there is a complication with your marriage.
I don't understand.
the vows are binding only until death do you part.
what are you saying?
death has already parted you.
if he finds out, he'll leave.
there must be something you can do.
well, there is one way.
Oh, please, please, let me tell her.
it requires the greatest sacrifice.
go on, get to the good part. -What is it?
we have to kill him! -What?
Victor would have to give up the life he had forever.
he would need to repeat his vows in the land of the living...
...and drink from the wine of ages.
poison!
this would stop his heart forever.
only then would he be free to give it to you.
I could never ask him.
you don't have to.
I'll do it.
my boy, if you choose this path...
...you may never return to the world above.
do you understand?
I do.
gather round. Gather round, everybody.
we've decided to do this thing properly.
so grab what you can and follow us.
we're moving this wedding party upstairs.
upstairs? I didn't know we had an upstairs.
sounds creepy. -Let's go!
a wedding, a wedding We're going to have a wedding
hold on, Victor.
you can't get married looking like that.
the spiders think you're very cute But goodness knows you need a suit
but have no fears, we're quite adept We'll have you looking lovely, lovely, lovely

thank you.
elegant, cultured, radiant.
victoria has found a husband...
...with all these qualities and more.
serendipity brought us together...
...and no force on earth could tear us apart.
there's an eye in me soup.
Oh, sorry.
fetch me musket!
fetch your own musket. I'm off!
coming through. Coming through.
excuse me, you don't know me, but I used to live in your dead mother.
Hey, hold on there.
I love a woman with meat on her bones.
finis, who invited these people?
they must be from your side of the family.
certainly not.
why, if my Grandfather Everglot could see this, he'd be turning in his grave.
finis.
where do you keep the spirits?
in other news, the dead walk the earth!
get back! Don't try and sneak up on me!
get back!
I'll give you such a wallop.
no.
Yeah.
grandpa?
bounder! -Sweetie pie.
monster. -Buttercup.
CAD! -Gertrude!
Alfred?
you've been dead for 1 5 years.
frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
Ethel!
wait. That's it.
we're going to take whatever money we can and get out of here.
money? What money?
your dowry. It's my right!
but my parents don't have any money.
it's my marriage to you that will save them from the poorhouse.
th-- The poorhouse?
you're lying. It isn't true. Tell me that you're lying!
did things not go according to your plan, Lord Barkis?
well, perhaps in disappointment we are perfectly matched.
be gone, ye demons from hell!
back to the void from whence you came!
you shall not enter here.
back, back!
keep it down, we're in a church.
evening.
dearly beloved and departed...
...we are gathered here today to join this man and this corpse in marriage.
Victor?
living first.
with this hand...
...I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty...
...for I will be your wine.
now you.
with this hand...
...I will lift your sorrows.
your cup will never empty.
for I will be...
I will be...
go on, my dear.
your cup will never empty
...for I will be...
I will be your wine.
she's having second thoughts.
I can't.
what's wrong?
this is wrong.
I was a bride.
my dreams were taken from me.
well, now...
now I've stolen them from someone else.
I love you, Victor.
but you're not mine.
Victoria!
Oh, how touching.
I always cry at weddings.
our young lovers together at last.
surely now they can live happily ever after.
but you forget she's still my wife!
I'll not leave here empty-handed!
you?
Emily?
you!
but-- But-- I left you.
for dead.
this woman is obviously delusional!
sorry to cut things short, but we must be on our way.
take your hands off her.
do I have to kill you too?
Victor, catch!
sorry.
I say, you're not playing fair, sir.
Touche, my dear.
get out.
Oh, I'm leaving.
but first a toast. To Emily.
always the bridesmaid, never the bride.
tell me, my dear...
...can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?
let me at him! Let me at him!
no, don't hold me back. -Wait.
we must abide by their rules.
we are amongst the living.
well said.
not anymore.
Yep, you're right. He's all yours.
new arrival.
Oh, Victor, I never thought I'd see you again.
wait.
I made a promise.
you kept your promise.
you set me free.
okay, boys, who wants Kandy?!
pick me, please!
man: Pick me, pick me!
come on!
D. O.A. is Joanna Kelton, stage name Kandy with a K.
she's a featured stripper here.
who found her?
manager, Andy Kula.
his girls hang out in the alley between sets.
he came out here looking for Kandy, and he found her like this.
he give us anything else?
Yeah, he said the vic was lube wrestling earlier in the evening with an overly aggressive customer.
he got thrown out of the club.
he's not a regular here, and nobody got his name.
TAYLOR: Careful.
that light's 1, 000 degrees, burn your eyes.
Scagnetti, get somebody to turn this light off.
signs of a struggle.
same shade of lipstick.
so the vic comes out here to have a smoke...
someone attacks her...
and it's lights out.
just in time.
you want to get that side?
how horrible.
that end.
ready?
Yeah.
extensive burn trauma.
skin's reddish brown.
take her over to Dr. Pino for official C. O.D.
all right. Take the light with you for processing.
Lindsay, you're inside with me.
might be something in there we can use to I. D. the customer our vic was wrestling.
well...
let me know if you find anything.
I'll get my boots.
MESSER: I just can't believe it.
two years have gone by,
I haven't heard one word.
and out of the blue, Louie leaves me a message.
he says, "I'm in the city. Want to grab a beer?"
could only mean trouble.
Ah, Danny, he's your brother.
cut him some slack.
I know, you're right.
but if not trouble, he's probably looking for a handout.
why don't you just call Louie back,
I mean, before assuming the worst.
whether it's really a beer he wants or he needs your help.
after all, he is family.
throat slashed with a knife.
MESSER: You sure that's him?
Yep, that's him.
billionaire recluse.
the Howard Hughes of the computer industry.
there was a picture of him in the paper last year.
actually, it was more like a composite.
rumor is, he didn't get out much.
I got some pills here.
sertraline.
our vic was
I got a blood trail.
is it just me, or is this bedroom kind of giving you the creeps?
no windows. That is kind of weird.
know what? You stay with the vic, I'm gonna go find Flack.
he caught this one. See what he knows.
housekeeper was the first to arrive for work this morning.
she says she walked in and found her boss dead.
my boys swept the area.
no signs of forced entry.
this place is tighter than Fort Knox.
who's the guy Linda's with?
it's Roger Hagler. He's a bodyguard.
he just showed up.
all right, who else has access to this house?
Dr. Lyle Penn, Hunter's personal physician.
he works here out of the house.
he's late today. That's it?
no butler? No.
too bad. I thought we could wrap this one up quick.
what?
mansion like this, it's always the butler.
didn't you ever play Clue?
I was a Monopoly guy.
Ah. All right.
big money always comes with enemies.
let's make a few phone calls, find out who stood to gain from Hunter Hudson's death.
that was fast.
funny how a little lube speeds up the processing.
wedding ring, male.
what about you?
found blood.
and this.
our vic was cheating on someone.
we may have a motive.
what's cooking?
John Doe.
nice teeth.
Dr. Sheldon Hawkes, the man we all want to be when we grow up.
how's the field work, Sherlock?
never a dull moment.
tan's fading.
but then there's always spray-on when I start looking like the inventory.
well, glad you're back.
giants jersey?
you know it. Mm-hmm.
what did we find on our burn victim.
I found antemortem defensive bruising, which means that she got into a fight just before she was killed.
your official C. O.D?
severe burn trauma caused by contact with the klieg light.
I did find something you might like.
this is interesting.
Oh...
tattoo on the inner thigh means eyes only, means our vic had a lover.
you're thinking lovers' spat?
things got a little heated?
literally.
you got a camera?
Hawkes is sending us a picture.
our vic had artwork.
heart, with a letter "A" in the middle of it.
wasn't the manager's name Andy?
Dr. Penn, what were you treating Mr. Hudson for?
was he sick?
hunter suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and O. C.D.
medication and daily hypnotherapy helped him to cope.
so the stories are true.
what, that Hunter was crazy?
20 years ago, he suffered a severe emotional trauma.
his younger brother was kidnapped and murdered.
and it was something he never really recovered from.
all right, well, thank you, Doctor.
please, whatever I can do.
hypnotherapy.
when you're rich enough, you try things.
hold on a sec.
that's not good.
what the...?!
What...?
Hey!
Hey, Danny, can you hear me?!
you kidding me?
it's called a panic room.
it's like a bank vault for homes.
Mr. Hudson built his bedroom inside of it.
it was his sanctuary.
staff weren't allowed inside.
he had security issues.
how do we open it?
I'm afraid Mr. Hudson was the only one who had the security code.
well, that's beautiful. I can see you guys.
Hey, Danny. All right, look, there's got to be another way to get in the room. This is the only door.
Mr. Hudson had it preset to close at 9: 00 p. m. and reopen again at 9: 00 a. m. when the staff arrived.
is that the time you got here?
no, 9: 30.
I usually arrive early to prepare breakfast, but I stopped at the market this morning.
you're telling me that this spaceship doesn't open up again till tomorrow morning?
it doesn't open, period.
you just said he had it preset to open at 9: 00 a. m.
that's under normal operating conditions.
once the panic button is hit, the room thinks an intruder is inside.
it will not reopen until the security code is entered.
how many numbers in the code?
I have no idea.
this is getting better and better.
I'm not spending a week in here with a crazy dead guy trying to figure out the code.
so, do me a favor, call the locksmith.
he built the room for Mr. Hudson.
I'll find him.
Thanks, Flack.
okay, well,
I'm going to start processing out here.
Danny, we've got it under control.
help is on the way.
I'll be in here.
you said Kandy got into an altercation with a customer last night. That's right.
creep would've killed her if I didn't throw him out.
what about you?
looks like he wasn't the only one to get physical.
look, half my night's spent hauling drunks out of here on their asses, Detective.
this is all I go home with, it's a good night.
what?
Oh, you think I killed Kandy?
you're jumping the gun there, Andy.
all I asked you was how you got that fat lip.
and I told you, okay?
it gets kind of messy in here sometimes.
what about in Kandy's dressing room?
if I run the blood I found and it matches your DNA, what's the story going to be then?
Yeah, okay? I was in her dressing room, okay?
Kan... Kandy and I were close.
close enough to have your initial tattooed on her inner thigh?
whoa, whoa, whoa. That was there way before I came along.
tell me about the fight you had.
she was cheating on me.
Yeah. I saw that online.
so when you found this, you were surprised, you got angry, you confronted Kandy and things got out of hand.
define your definition of "out of hand," Detective?
murder.
not even close.
why should I believe you?
look, obviously you never been in here on a night when a stripper isn't killed;
the place is wall-to-wall honeys.
I do all the hirings and firings,
I got the pick of the litter.
saves on the wining and dining.
look, all I'm saying is, you're right,
I didn't like her playing behind my back.
but I didn't kill her.
wouldn't even waste my time.
we'll talk again.
BONASERA: Hey, Danny?
you find something?
Yeah.
I've got a blood trail that strangely seems to lead to the sink first, then the phone.
maybe the housekeeper got sick, went to the sink.
there's an awful lot of blood in here.
I got short strides. Tells me she wasn't running.
she knew Hunter was dead. What's the rush?
then she probably checked for the pulse.
I don't know.
this blood pool looks undisturbed.
there are no signs that she checked for vitals.
okay, Linda finds her boss in a pool of blood, yet doesn't check to make sure he's dead.
and then she takes her time to call the police.
she's got my attention.
cavalry's here. This is Jerry Gordon.
his company built Mr. Hudson's panic room.
Hallelujah.
unfortunately, there's no master code that can override the system.
only way in here is if I cut a new door.
how long is that going to take?
minimum, 13 hours.
MESSER: Excuse me?
thirteen hours?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to shut down this power to do it.
the backup generator will kick in when I pull the plug, but it's only got limited power.
forget fresh air circulating.
these vents aren't hooked up to any kind of auxiliary power feed.
that's beautiful.
might get a little toasty in there.
I suggest you conserve your oxygen.
fantastic.
excuse me. Yeah.
BONASERA: Hey, Danny?
you got to start processing in there right now.
process? With what?
I don't have a kit.
I know. You're going to have to improvise.
you heard what Jerry said, it's going to get hot in there.
if you don't start now, that body's going to decay further and we're going to lose evidence.
we can't let the killer get a head start.
Stella's been calling every half hour with updates.
I have a city engineer reviewing blueprints of the room to see if there are any other points of entry.
so just stand by, I'll keep you informed.
okay.
is he going to be all right?
they have a locksmith cutting a new door.
how long is that going to take?
they estimate 13 hours.
what do you know?
I went through the data on Kandy's computer.
found her last bit of Internet activity.
she was logged onto "cheats-on-you. com"
there's her picture in the list of cheaters.
who outed Kandy?
according to the IP address on the submission, it came in about a week ago from Kandy's computer.
but the e-mail address belongs to a woman named Angie Charles.
how long were you and Kandy lovers?
a little over two years.
monroe: These are beautiful.
those were from a freelance shoot in South America a few months ago.
I take it these were from a different assignment?
female nudes are what I'm known for.
when was the last time you saw her? Last week.
what about last night?
I was at home.
alone.
look, it was a bad breakup.
I wish there was more I can tell you.
the last time I saw Kandy, she was here, she packed some boxes, she split.
we barely spoke.
you asked her to move out?
Angie: 'Cause she was moving on.
some guy at the club she stripped at.
that's right.
and so you posted her picture on cheats-on-you. com for revenge.
buyer beware.
Kandy was a gold-digger.
I just wanted her next lover to know all the facts.
I gave her everything she wanted...
and she burned me.
and someone did the same to her.
all right, I got the vic's clothes off.
first thing I want you to do is visually examine the entire body.
and then describe to me the nature and location of all the wounds and abnormalities.
MESSER: Got a flashlight.
lucky for you you're not claustrophobic.
me? I do not like confined spaces.
why'd you choose a career that puts you in windowless rooms with dead bodies, then?
ladies love the degree.
they don't ask specifics.
six years of med school to become a player, huh?
no, I was already a player, Messer,
I just needed the bank to pay for my Porsche.
you know what? I officially hate you right now, all right?
are you done?
Yeah.
only thing abnormal about our vic is the blood leaking from his neck.
no defensive wounds?
not that I see.
doesn't look like he fought back.
okay. Describe the neck wound to me.
no hesitation marks.
one cut, and it looks clean.
a single incised wound.
is there blanching?
I'm pushing on the lividity.
it's clearing and coming back.
your victim's been in that position for less than six hours.
let's get a more precise TOD.
you're not serious.
there's got to be a bathroom there, right?
Yeah.
be a good Boy Scout and find a thermometer.
it's your lucky day, Doc.
nice.
now plant it in the end zone and put some points on the board.
is it in?
give me a second.
Rigor's setting in.
welcome to my world.
temperature is 93.
that means your victim's been dead for four hours, rigor and lividity confirm it.
no, that's impossible. The housekeeper said this room did not open up until three hours ago.
if that's the case, then, um...
how'd your killer get inside?
everything was a blur after I found Mr. Hudson dead.
I was in shock.
I don't even remember calling 911.
were you not afraid the killer was still in the house?
why'd you stay?
my boss was lying in a pool of blood.
I guess I wasn't thinking about myself.
if you're trying to say that I had something to do with Mr. Hudson's death, you're wrong.
I loved my boss.
Wow.
newspapers made him out to be a madman.
eccentric, absolutely.
hunter was controlling.
he didn't tolerate much of anything.
no drinking.
no smoking.
no social life.
but he treated his employees fairly.
FLACK: Oh... I'll say.
we took a peek at Hunter's will.
did you know he left you a large chunk of his estate?
he told me that I would be taken care of when he died.
I had no idea...
$40 million.
rest of his employees didn't see anything close to that.
you see why we needed to talk.
I understand how that makes me look, yes.
but you say it as if I won some sort of lottery, when all that's happened is I lost a friend.
BONASERA: Hey, Danny?
our housekeeper had all the right answers.
well, maybe she's a really good liar.
Yeah.
the panic room does not open till 9: 00 a. m. yet Hunter was killed an hour earlier.
how does somebody get in a locked vault with only one door?
if Houdini were alive, we'd have our killer.
the only way to solve this puzzle is to find something in that room.
all right, what do you suggest?
let's print the knife.
now, I saw a coffee pot in there, grab that.
and see if you can find some glue.
mighty Glue.
okay, that'll do.
empty the glue into the coffee pot.
once you do that,
I want you to insert the knife and then turn the machine on.
I think I seen this on an episode of The Flintstones.
cute.
all right.
cute.
Yeah, me and my girlfriend, we downloaded the same ringer.
Eh-- speak of the devil.
MESSER: It's working.
BONASERA: All right, now we're going to need elimination prints.
pen ink will be great.
miss MacGyver?
grab your camera, I've got a foreign print.
that's it, hold that.
great.
come on, come on...
got a hit.
nice.
who is it?
know where we can find him?
Yeah. Downstairs.
I got to get out of here.
how long have you been Mr. Hudson's bodyguard? Three years.
before that, I spent 15 with the NYPD.
hmm. So, you know my service record, and we're done here.
sit down, Mr. Hagler.
I'll tell you when we're done.
you really think I would kill Mr. Hudson?
sit down!
he left you $2 million.
that gives me the right to ask you a couple of questions.
where were you this morning at 8: 00?
my apartment.
I was alone.
and last night?
I went out.
I met some friends at O'Hurley's, a cop bar in Washington Heights.
you may have heard of it?
I thought Mr. Hudson didn't allow his employees to drink.
you're right.
I broke protocol.
it was my ex-partner's birthday.
figured Mr. Hudson was in his room for the night.
couple of pops with the boys wouldn't change anything.
yet it did.
jerry: Yo, Detective, you all right?
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.
I think your phone's ringing.
Yeah, I know.
but you're not gonna answer it?
it's my brother.
I've got enough problems for one day.
Hey. Found traces of a second skin donor on the klieg light.
DNA was heat degraded.
I was only able to get amelogenin. Male.
our manager didn't have any burns.
anything else?
tree sap. Sent it down to the lab.
Hey. I find out our mystery wrestler.
I cross-referenced the inscription on the wedding ring against the credit cards used at the strip club.
came up with a name-- John Grimes.
he's on his way to Interrogation.
TAYLOR: You like strippers, Mr. Grimes?
who doesn't?
that's not what the manager of Raunch 'N Roll told me. He said you did a number on Kandy.
Oh. Other way around.
but you did hit her? I was defending myself.
you were lube wrestling.
I wouldn't call that life threatening.
all right, I was drunk.
she humiliated me.
every... Everyone was laughing.
the manager threw me out. That was it.
don't waste my time, John.
a klieg light
that's about the heat needed to put those burns on your hand.
all right...
I realized I lost my wedding ring, so I waited outside.
I figured I'd ask someone to go in and get it for me.
I heard the alley was the place the girls had their smokes, so I went out there, but she was already dead.
lying there on the light.
then how did you burn your hand?
she had some money sticking out of her bathing suit.
I took it.
I wish the whole night hadn't happened.
how much money did Kandy have on her? 500 bucks.
a phone call would have cost you 50 cents. Get up.
wait. I didn't kill her.
I don't know about that yet.
for now, I'm arresting you on grand larceny.
let's go.
Hey, Danny, I'm back. What have you got?
I think I got trace.
looks smeared.
like it could have been deposited in a scuffle.
okay. Well, we're gonna have to test it.
look around. Improvise.
the word of the day-- improvise. All right.
hello.
Oh, my.
BONASERA: What? What did you find?
is that an ear?
Yeah.
it belonged to Hunter's brother, Joshua.
20 years ago, he was taken from the house in the middle of the night.
hunter was sleeping five feet away.
kidnappers sent back the ear as proof of life.
parents paid the ransom, but the kid was still murdered.
and a few years later, his parents die in a plane crash.
left him all alone.
maybe the trace on his clothes will tell us something.
I'm gonna get started.
Yes.
all right.
I got seven lines for the unknown on the notepad and ten lines for the solvent.
okay. That means our ratio is 0. 7.
that's our RF value.
the solvent is isopropyl alcohol.
okay, and the mystery stain is...
nicotine.
all right, so, who do we like so far that smokes?
Dr. Penn.
please, whatever I can do.
ten years ago, you had your license revoked temporarily for malpractice.
did Mr. Hudson know that?
it's not exactly something that one would put on a resume, no.
Mr. Hudson was a clean freak.
and yet we found traces of nicotine on his pajamas.
see, that puts you inside the panic room.
that's right.
I came here last night to talk to Hunter.
he wanted to fire me.
Why?
he was, uh, severely depressed.
he-he wanted me to increase his dosage of Sertraline, but I refused to overmedicate.
please, Mr. Hudson, don't do this. Get out, get out.
you got to stick with the treatment you're on.
we've made great strides together. Get out, get out! Out!
out!
and that was the last time you saw Hunter Hudson?
Yes, and he was very much alive.
now, Mr. Hudson wouldn't allow his employees to smoke, and yet, you did.
hypnosis is a very powerful tool, Detective.
I bet.
what, you have the pocket watch swinging back and forth?
people get sleepy, and then do whatever you tell them to do?
the trance work that I incorporate into my sessions includes a controlled environment, and a hypnotic suggestion.
are you telling me that you made him think that you weren't a smoker?
Wow.
what else did you make him think?
I'm not sure why you're looking at me.
I'm not the only one who had contact with nicotine.
was a smoker.
I treated her a couple of months ago, using hypnosis to break the habit.
tell me what you got, Hawkes.
Hey. Take a look at this trace I found on the light.
it's actually very old tree sap.
which technically makes it amber.
you ID the black traces?
well, looks like some type of carbon containing compound.
flora maybe, trapped inside the amber.
send it down to the AMS lab. Okay.
Hey.
Hey, Danny. It's Stella.
listen, I talked to Dr. Penn.
Flack is checking out his alibi, but we have a second smoker
Linda, the housekeeper.
nice.
well, I got a body that's degrading.
and blood that's starting to clot.
wait a minute. Sertraline is an anti-coagulant.
if he was taking it, his blood wouldn't be clotting.
it does makes sense, 'cause he told Dr. Penn that his meds weren't working.
well, maybe what he was taking wasn't an anti-depressant.
exactly.
well, maybe if he was off his meds, he killed himself.
whoever swapped Hunter's pills with placeboes wanted him depressed, suicidal...
hello. Can you see me?
Yeah, you look beautiful. Now get me out of here.
few more of these, we'll be able to start cutting a new door.
couple more?!
sorry.
Hey, Danny, stay with me.
we're getting closer, all right?
remember that blue trace we found when we first arrived?
send it through.
I'm sending it through.
here it comes.
got it.
making progress. Yeah.
crime stopper, run to Ray's, grab me a slice, extra pepperoni, all right?
bring it back.
just fold it up, slide it right through, huh?
that's no way to treat good pizza, Messer.
I checked on Hagler
alibis check out.
what do you got there?
surfactant and hypochlorite.
and for those of us with just a high school diploma?
uh, soap and bleach.
laundry detergent.
someone was in a hurry.
FLACK: Is that blood?
there's only one way to find out.
it's diluted, but it definitely is blood.
Linda was trying to wash her uniform when Jerry cut the power.
find Linda Cortez.
HAWKES: Hey, Mac.
ran our amber sample through A. M.S.
carbon date came back 55, 000 years old.
from a Kapok tree.
silk cotton.
kapok was used to make blowguns in the jungles of South America.
isn't that where Angie did her photo shoot a few months ago?
MAC: Tell us about this necklace.
it was a gift.
the women in that village made it for me.
we found pieces of it on the light that killed your lover.
I wasn't even there. Well, then how'd the necklace get there? I don't know.
maybe Kandy took it.
when did you take these pictures?
this morning.
they're all out of focus.
you recently suffered a trauma
it's called Macular Edema.
1, 000 degrees ought to do it.
MAC: Kandy cheated on you, and you killed her for it.
I told you, I wasn't even there.
that's not what the pictures are telling us.
I went to the club to apologize.
she was still angry at me for posting her on that cheater's website.
we started to argue.
things... things got out of hand.
it was an accident.
I loved her.
you sure had a strange way of showing it.
give me your hands.
FLACK: Smoke?
no, thanks.
that's right. You don't smoke.
it's a nasty habit.
stains your fingers, teeth, messes with your breath.
you sure you don't want a cigarette?
I told you.
right.
I know, right.
but you told Dr. Penn you smoked.
in fact, you went to him to quit smoking.
didn't you?
got Linda in Interrogation with nothing to say.
all right.
then we'll let her uniform do the talking.
arterial spray everywhere.
Linda was standing in front of Hunter when the cut was made.
DNA confirms that the blood was his.
case closed.
not exactly.
see, if she did slice his throat, there'd be a lot more blood on her sleeve, especially given the amount of arterial spray
then how did she slice his throat?
maybe she didn't.
I'm thinking maybe Hunter did it himself.
Linda forced him to.
she hypnotized him.
that's why she went to Dr. Penn.
to learn how to hypnotize Hunter, not to stop smoking.
Mr. Hudson.
I'm gonna need you
LINDA: In a few moments, your mind and body will become more relaxed...
...concentrate on the sound of my voice... on the sound of...
but it still doesn't explain how she got into that room.
Hey, my-my phone's dying. I got half a bar.
and we have the housekeeper.
nice, nice, nice.
but I'm looking at what seems to be a secondary blood donor.
if the housekeeper doesn't have a cut on her body, she might have a partner.
know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking you got greedy.
you got sick of taking care of Mr. Hudson, so you killed him.
no, I'm sorry.
actually, you had him kill himself.
at first, I thought it was ingenious having him commit suicide via hypnosis.
now that I see you don't have any cuts on you,
I know you had a partner.
yo.
do me a favor. Get me out of here.
I'm trying, pal. Come on.
my partner's got a suspect in custody right now.
it's going down, and I'm stuck in here, man.
Yeah, it won't be long now, I promise.
get dressed.
she stays here.
thank you.
what are you doing, man? Jerry, what are you doing?
I want you to call your partner.
tell her to let Linda go.
it's you.
it was you? Stop moving.
huh? Stop moving.
you could have opened this door this whole time!
stop moving! Huh?
stop! How'd you get that cut? Huh?
what, he fight back? He fought back, didn't he?
let me tell you something, this wack job has been wanting to kill himself for years!
years!
come time, he couldn't do it.
stop moving!
get on the phone!
all right, easy.
pick up the phone!
call your partner! Now! I will!
all right.
call your partner!
partner's right here!
leave!
now or I'll kill him!
settle down.
relax your arm! Settle down!
you all right?
Thanks, yeah.
all right. We got him.
all right, get on your feet. Come on.
Hey, what do you say we get out of here?
you got a phone I could use?
Yep.
Thanks.
I'll catch up with you. All right? No problem.
it's your brother.
you want to go grab that beer?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll grab you in an hour.
be careful, even in our backyard.
we have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.
Jessi starts back at school today.
I sort of levitated.
show me how.
I will.
she's the one who attacked me.
I know Lori will never forgive me.
you have to earn forgiveness.
she could be you.
what?
the two of you used to play that song all the time.
it's not there.
it's a Latnok Ring.
all the members received rings.
it was a way of identifying one another.
and you're Latnok?
Yes.
I got accepted into a music program in New York.
I leave in two days.
two days?
I miss this.
I miss you.
I didn't want to go back to how I was before.
how were you before?
invisible.
I'll call... and text and e-mail.
I'm gonna come back to you.
you promise?
promise.
spring cleaning- a curious ritual.
Nicole said it meant time to rid ourselves of things we didn't need anymore.
the first step is reflection.
what's worth keeping?
what's lost its value and can be given away?
for some, the choice is easy.
for others, much more difficult.
getting rid of all that.
actually, I've gone through, and...
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.
Oh, kyle, you don't have to, but...
a lot of this stuff has seen its best day.
look at this t-shirt.
it's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded.
I wore this the first time Stephen took me to work with him.
well... this one's torn.
I ripped it playing basketball with Josh.
great game.
the first gift Lori ever gave me.
sentimental pack rat. Great.
we're in trouble.
look, this isn't supposed to be torture.
consider it a chance to shed your old skin, be someone new.
dude, take a load off.
let's throw this puppy around for a few.
let me grab the rest of the boxes first.
the boxes aren't going anywhere.
but I told Nicole that I...
the best part about spring cleaning is ditching out on spring cleaning.
you can't do it, can ya?
you always have to do the right thing.
and you always find a way of putting fun before work.
alphabetical order, my encyclopedic friend.
but I will have you know, I'm done with my room.
and I'm trashing this with the rest of my stuff.
but first...
bite marks. - Foam.
it irresistible.
come on. Show me what you got.
okay.
keep going.
more.
you didn't tell me you were coming.
no one knows.
I'm surprising my mom for her birthday.
you're a good present.
how's New York?
amazing. Everything I imagined.
and the music program?
the teachers are all so inspiring.
and the students there are so talented.
like you.
they've all had incredible training.
it was intimidating at first, but I know I'm in good company.
I'm learning about composers I never knew.
Amanda's heart was beating rapidly, and she was speaking really fast.
she seemed happy, but I could sense that she was troubled. - I'm already a better technical player.
is everything all right?
I can never hide anything from you.
but I need to let my mom know I'm home.
can we get together later?
of course.
good.
I guess we need to talk.
she said what?
we need to talk.
nothing.
no, I missed something.
well, when someone says,"we need to talk,"
sometimes it's a lead in to a discussion about feelings that have changed.
feelings?
prepare yourself, dude.
she's dumping you.
at least she has the decency to do it in person.
don't read into it.
just wait and hear what she has to say.
no. Not my lucky shirt.
Josh, you've outgrown it.
I couldn't help but wonder...
had amanda already outgrown me?
okay, grab hold of the wire and make these babies blink.
what?
you turned a block full of headlights on.
this should be easy.
are you serious?
you said I look for ways to slack off.
this I take seriously.
you have to challenge that brilliant mind of yours, and someone has to fill in for that Foss guy, right?
well, that someone, my friend, will be me.
Really?
just- Make 'em blink.
is it working?
not really.
thinking about Amanda drained all the voltage out of him.
Yeah, I heard.
we need to talk.
sorry she left you hanging.
typical woman.
um, anyway...
I need to look for my digital projector.
you giving that away, too?
no, I need it for a lecture I'm giving at U. W.
you're giving a lecture?
I mean... you're giving a lecture.
I've been asked to speak at a symposium tomorrow.
are you getting paid for this thing?
because you're supposed to bring home the bacon, dad, and I eat a lot of bacon.
for your information, Josh, I have already had a job offer.
this lecture is about showing my expertise...
for free.
well, I think your expertise is worth more than that.
thank you, kyle.
I'll let you two get back to work.
<DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADOLESCENT MORAL CODE>
what's that?
just an old magazine.
you done in your room?
Yep.
and now I need permission to boycott an assignment.
let me guess: Math.
Nope. Me.
my guidance counselor is making everyone write a two-page essay about who you really are.
I don't know the answer to that yet.
I mean, how old were you when you figured that out?
I'll let you know when I get there.
figuring out who you are is a constantly evolving process.
constantly evolving process.
that's three words. I need more.
how about "sarcastic," "moody," and "cynical"?
I didn't ask you.
and I'm not a cynic.
I am totally "glass is half full."
I just acknowledge that the other half of the glass is a desolate void of disappointment, misery, and regret.
preparing ahead makes me pragmatic.
uh, speaking of being prepared...
homework? Done.
I know.
you should call Ripley's.
I need an opinion.
I can't decide which one.
what do you guys think, plaid?
definitely.
Thanks.
you and Amanda should take a walk around the marina.
sunsets are really pretty.
maybe we will.
dead man walking.
hello.
can I come in?
there's a front door.
I wanted to see you. This is quicker.
what happened?
Oh, I- I slipped and hit my shoulder.
jumping off another roof?
Kyle, I've learned my lesson.
and I'm here to learn another one.
you said I have to work my way up to do things like levitate, so start teaching me.
I can't.
there's nobody around.
I have plans tonight with Amanda.
Oh, Amanda. She's home?
as a surprise.
you're anxious about it.
your heart's beating really fast, I can tell.
she told me,"we need to talk."
so?
you don't think that means anything?
it means she wants to talk to you?
isn't that a good thing?
that's what I thought.
so, uh, when can we get started?
when Amanda goes back, I'll have time.
okay. Well...
good-bye. - Bye.
ready?
Kyle, I can't go out.
but you said we need to talk.
I'm sorry. I can't see you.
Amanda? Inside!
this is all your fault.
what?
my daughter flying clear across the country to surprise me.
you're not happy she's home?
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my birthday as an excuse to tell me she wants to drop out.
drop out of the conservatory? Why?
as if you didn't know you're the reason.
she didn't say anything to me about it.
we haven't even had a chance to talk.
you're not gonna get that chance.
you will not see or speak to Amanda until she's back where she belongs, at that school.
I don't understand why she won't let me speak to Amanda.
well, unfortunately, Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction.
I just want to know what happened, make sure she's okay.
well, put yourself in Mrs. Bloom's shoes.
what I mean is, try to see things from her perspective.
that music conservatory sounds like a pretty big opportunity, one that Amanda shouldn't miss.
I don't want her to miss it.
but Mrs. Bloom shouldn't force her to go back.
Kyle, I'm afraid Mrs. Bloom has every right to send Amanda back whether she wants to go or not.
just as she has the right to ask you to stay away.
and the hard truth is...
it's really none of our business.
you know what Amanda means to me.
if she's struggling with, or confused about something, how could it be none of my business?
I know you're bummed, but look at the bright side.
which, by the way, is my new M. O.
at least Amanda wasn't planning on dumping you.
how do you know that?
Mrs. Bloom blames you for ruining her life.
it seems to me like Amanda flying home was a case of "girl missing boy next door."
but we don't know that.
we don't know anything Amanda's feeling.
no one's letting her explain.
even mom and dad.
I can't believe they're siding with Mrs. Bloom.
I can't believe we're siding with Carol Bloom.
she's uptight, narrow-minded.
Yeah, and those are her good qualities.
well, like it or not, we have to respect what she wants for her daughter.
but Kyle has shown nothing but love and concern for Amanda.
and now we have to keep them apart?
the funny thing is, knowing Kyle, he'd make the situation a lot better if he were just allowed to talk to her.
you remember being Kyle's age?
when something like this takes over your whole life...
that's half the fun of being in love.
now we have to be the buzz kills, the grown-ups.
well, if this is what being a grown-up means.
it sucks.
why can't mom and dad do something?
they can't cross the line with Mrs. Bloom.
they're all about crossing the line when something's not fair.
go throw mom one of your "puppy dog in a thunderstorm" looks.
get her to change her mind.
they made it clear.
I have to obey Mrs. Bloom's request.
this isn't right.
I can't just stand back and do nothing.
Kyle, do I detect defiance?
genius joins the dark side.
I've got a list of rules I've been dying for you to break.
I don't want to break any rules.
I won't have to.
I'll do exactly what Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.
Atta boy, Kyle. Take a stand.
why are your feet on my bed?
there were still ways to contact Amanda without seeing or speaking to her.
I could easily circumvent Mrs. Bloom without leaving my own house.
no MESSAGES
did you get my text?
username Blocked By Parental Control
but it seemed she could find ways to thwart me just as easily.
if electronic messages weren't getting through, there would be no way for me to send a note or a letter without Mrs. Bloom intercepting it.
I couldn't see or speak to Amanda.
the written word was no longer an option.
but there were still a few notes I could send her way.
I hoped this message would get through, and she would at least know I was thinking about her.
I was just trying...
I know what you were doing.
I think you better come in now.
what? You want my music now, too?
you've already confiscated my phone and my computer.
I know this is hard for you to understand.
tthat you're keeping me prisoner?
you will leave this house when you agree to return to new york to become the extraordinary pianist you're meant to be.
mom, I'm not seven years old anymore.
you think I don't get that this is a great opportunity for me?
then why would you throw it away?
because it's not right for me now.
it's not what I want.
you don't know what you want.
dude...
the crispity, crunchity goodness in that bowl is long gone.
I'm not really hungry.
my essay sucks.
speaking of sucks...
what? I meant Shakespeare.
extra credit. Impressive.
impressive would be figuring out what language this was written in.
I thought Kyle might be able to translate, but...
well, what part are you at?
the part that says it's about two families and it's set in "fair verona."
that's the first two lines.
she lives exactly 38 feet 9 inches away, and I can't even tell her I'm sorry.
you could if she wasn't locked in her own house.
who else but Mrs. Bloom actually changes the alarm code to keep someone in?
I just hope Amanda doesn't feel as bad as I do.
looks like we have our own resident pair of star-crossed lovers.
the balcony scene's her favorite part of the play.
of course, it didn't end well for them.
so Romeo and Juliet did everything in their power to be together.
you guys know how this ends?
why didn't you say so?
this all began when Amanda said we needed to talk.
that's exactly what we're gonna do.
I can write my essay later.
whatever it is, I'm in.
wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.
if you wanna help, you have to commit, take this seriously.
then let me drive the get away car instead.
or I could create a diversion or something.
Hey, you want in? Accept the assignment.
then I guess I'll see if I can borrow one of Andy's.
what can I do to help?
help what?
help Kyle have a night out with Amanda like you've been talking about.
how do you know what we've been talking about? You just sat down.
I listened in while I was sitting at that table over there.
I thought you had the copyright on that move.
I can do anything Kyle can do.
could you make out with Amanda?
cause that would be hot.
it's a common male fantasy to watch two women make out.
number six on popular top-ten lists, but it's not really backed by statistical evidence.
that's all really fascinating and everything, Kyle, but I think what she really needs to learn is the meaning of privacy.
bitchy, not cynical.
a total difference.
I was just trying to help.
actually, I think there is something you can do.
can I help you?
is Amanda home? I'm a friend.
I've seen you going in and out of the Trager house.
you're Lori's trampy friend.
Oh, no, that's Hillary.
well, whoever you are, Amanda is not allowed to have visitors.
Oh, but do tell Kyle,"nice try."
dad! - Josh!
guess who was a hit at the symposium?
I knew you'd be.
Yeah, I was a little nervous when I got there, but I look out and I see a room full of computer science geeks.
my peeps.
sounds like...
really fulfilling and fascinating stuff.
say, uh, why don't you take a load off, and I'll put that projector away for you.
sure. Thanks.
that's our block?
on a map of the power grid.
there's our house. And Amanda's.
and how does that help?
I need to know how the neighborhood is wired.
this has high-voltage cables, transformers, utility lines, breaker panels.
it's part of the plan.
I'm back.
Jessi, please try to use the...
front door. Right.
how'd it go?
so, uh, I'll see you at the rack later?
okay. Bye.
she was done, right?
I should probably get going.
um, didn't you just leave?
I wanted to talk to you, and, um...
Kyle said that I should...
use the front door.
okay.
your parents didn't press charges, and they could have.
they understand that what I did to you wasn't me.
and I'm really lucky that they do.
Yeah, you are.
Kyle explained everything to you.
I didn't want to beat you up.
it was my programming.
things... went wrong.
so, what, you caused the most traumatic experience of my life, and now you're telling me that it's not your fault?
I'm telling you I'm sorry.
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.
I'm here to help.
I'm trying.
then I guess I can try, too.
okay.
want some help?
dig in.
Hey, I thought you got rid of this.
I got a little nostalgic and rescued it from the reject pile.
I got a little nostalgic myself today.
being back on campus again, no office politics, no corporate crap, just this flow of ideas.
it was a real give-and-take.
I forgot how satisfying that can be.
it's been a long time since you talked about teaching.
Yeah, I know.
I was surprised when the feeling hit me.
I was also surprised when the head of the computer science program mentioned an adjunct professorship.
Stephen, that's great. Two job offers.
no, no, no, just the one. I turned it down.
Why?
well, you wanna get back in the public sector, and I already have a fantastic job.
I mean, it's a great salary.
I'd be the senior vp in charge of software development.
Yeah, at a company that makes elevator control panels.
well, it's not as exciting as a career change, I admit, but at least this time around, I won't have an evil boss.
how'd it go?
mission accomplished.
excellent.
so far.
what you are planning here is so out there, there is no way everything will go right.
Suzy cynic.
Kyle, your plan is genius!
it's totally optimistic, at least what I understand of it.
thank you.
so what's next?
well, Jessi got the alarm code, and you got her to pull down the shade, so on to phase two.
here you go.
phase two.
now we just wait for dark.
I have unwavering faith and fully support your exploits, but how is that a plan?
you got something better?
it's just that there's a lot at stake for Kyle's sake, and I don't want anything to go wrong.
any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.
I'm sure he has.
then why don't you just relax?
Kyle's plan has to work, otherwise he won't get to Amanda before she's gone for good.
I think phase two has been activated.
think about Amanda, how much you want to see her, to hold her...
to touch her.
Josh, eww.
what? He needs an emotional trigger.
the other thing I need is silence.
good idea. Lori, out!
what did I do?
this is man's work.
I so wanna make a joke right now.
she could have stayed.
Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy, and I didn't want her to hear it.
listen, Kyle, I get how messed up you are right now.
if anybody told me I couldn't see Andy ever again, I'd be a mess, too.
but you've got to pull it together.
you really think I can do this?
knowing how much you care about Amanda?
zero doubts.
come on.
deep breaths, just take it slow, one bulb at a time.
by focusing, I could control the flow of electrons along the wire, much like driving a car along a narrow road.
in this case, the road led into the trager house's electrical system, which in turn connected to the neighborhood transformer.
through the transformer, I was able to reach Amanda's house and gain access to the house's electrical system.
once inside, I could direct the flow of electrons through the wires hidden in the walls.
I was able to find my way to Amanda's room.
finally, I got my message through.
and finally, we would have our chance to talk.
phase three.
meet ME AT THE RACK. ALARM CODE 12154
you owe me... big.
Trager, you really embraced your inner hallmark card.
you've gone soft.
I know. You can cut the irony with a spoon.
I just hope it's worth it.
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing.
all this for puppy love?
I mean, seriously, what are the odds that the person you're gonna spend the rest of your life with is literally the girl next door?
I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo on the whole love vibe, but I don't want to set kyle up to get his heart chopped, sliced, and diced.
God, that felt good.
did you see where I put the napkins?
is there a garlic convention in here?
too much?
never.
what's the occasion?
take your pick.
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.
I appreciate the life we have and that we have such good kids.
I'm incredibly hungry.
how about all of the above?
you mentioned Amanda would be missing an opportunity.
you ever feel that way?
what makes you think I feel that way?
spring cleaning.
dragging the past out of the closets, seeing who we've become.
you still look great in a bikini.
I wouldn't know.
I haven't worn one since Josh was born.
remember how I was supposed to be the cool mom who published thought-provoking articles and had a career?
all I've accomplished this weekend is five loads of laundry.
not to mention an insanely aromatic marinara sauce.
Yes, there was a time when I wanted to teach, but I don't feel like I'm really missing anything, 'cause I never went down that path.
but you had to go the corporate route to support our family.
which I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.
why don't you go gather the troops.
all right. I'm on it.
is she coming?
I hope so. She got my message.
I know now is not the best time to ask, but can we add that electrical trick to the list?
I really want to learn that, too.
after Amanda goes back to New York, when you have more time.
I promise I'll make time.
but I have to make time for Amanda, too.
she might be staying.
Oh, she's staying?
she doesn't want to go back.
you're surprised.
no, it's- it's good news for you.
do you know why?
not yet, but now I have a chance to find out.
thank you...
for your help.
your dinner is getting cold.
I know you're not very happy with me right now, but I am only looking out for your best interests.
I made that noodle casserole you like so much.
Hey, hon?
where the hell are they?
this could be the biggest move you bust all night, so we just wanna make sure you have it down.
meet her at the door.
compliment her.
walk her over to the table.
offer her a seat.
Yes. Care to demonstrate?
would you like a seat?
no. No, no.
you have to pull the chair out for her.
and then just slip it underneath her as she sits.
not too fast or you'll take her out at the knees.
right. Not too fast.
why am I even worried?
you'll be fine.
does it look okay?
perfect.
I love this.
the lights, the table, everything.
and the window in my room. How'd you even get the idea for that?
Romeo and Juliet.
act 2, scene 2, line 2.
the balcony scene. That's
your favorite scene in the play.
I like that you pay attention to weird little details like that.
you do?
you're blushing.
I am?
I shouldn't have said that. I totally embarrassed you.
no. Amanda...
you can always say whatever you want with me.
and asparagus, with shaved romano and pancetta.
I don't think this is what we ordered.
right.
cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.
I took some liberties with the menu.
you made this?
no one knows I'm secretly a fan of top chef.
and no one ever will.
stop staring.
I can't. I'm O. Ding on suspense.
I wonder how it's going.
you wanna know if it's going badly.
what you witnessed earlier was a completely uncharacteristic outburst.
no, it's how you really feel.
it was just a mini meltdown brought on by some stupid homework assignment.
the "Who you really are" essay?
no one ever takes that seriously.
well, almost no one.
it was recently brought to my attention that
I am always the girl with the wry commentary and the patented eye roll.
honest question.
do you think I'm a cynic?
honest answer? Absolutely.
you're Miss possible but not likely.
about my own life? Of course.
but watching those two, who am I to say they're not meant for each other?
I mean, look at them.
have you ever seen two people look at each other like Kyle and Amanda?
not in a while.
Amanda, you said we need to talk.
right.
you didn't think I meant...
maybe a little.
after a few people weighed in.
the one time you didn't take my words literally.
did you really think my feelings had changed?
is that why you brought me here?
I brought you here 'cause everyone else was making assumptions about what you wanted, and how you were feeling and what was right for you.
but no one was actually asking you.
that's why my feelings for you could never change.
didn't know the lights out here twinkled.
only for you.
you have no idea how disappointed I am right now!
Mom-save your excuses!
your flight leaves in less than two hours.
my flight-you heard me.
but you haven't heard her.
you have nothing to say in the matter!
but I do!
don't you even care? I'm not happy at the conservatory.
of course I care!
but I also care about scholarships, opportunities.
I care about your future.
if you really cared about my future, you would not have sold my piano in the first place!
mom, I'm sorry. I didn't
get in the car, now.
I have to go.
I understand.
I hope you're satisfied.
it took all my will power not to trip her.
thank you for letting me know Amanda was here.
glad I could help.
welcome home.
I'd ask you what you were thinking, but I don't think you were thinking at all.
actually, this took a great deal of planning.
not helping.
the Blooms' situation was private.
we made it very clear you were not to see Amanda.
you were not to get involved.
I know I broke a rule, but I'm not sorry I did.
I had to do it, for Amanda.
good intentions aside, you're still grounded.
all of you. Two weeks.
what?
school, work, home.
everything else is off-limits.
and I'll take your cell phones.
this was my idea.
Lori and Josh shouldn't be punished.
they were just helping.
exactly.
what if Foss...
if anyone important calls, I'll have it with me.
do I get one last call? - No.
but you do get to go to your rooms.
now.
grounding Kyle.
who would have expected it?
and he was the ringleader.
when did that start happening?
be honest.
you're kinda glad they did it, aren't you?
aren't you?
some rules are meant to be broken.
about that.
I think we should break some rules, too.
Stephen, I don't want us to sail into a complacent, suburban existence without fighting the good fight.
I want you to pursue that opportunity at U. W.
Nicole, that's not an option.
well, then we need to make it one.
you can't get the chance to pursue an old dream and just pass on it.
we have mouths to feed.
we'll keep them fed.
we'll make it work. We always do.
spring cleaning isn't just about sorting through things and getting rid of clutter.
it's about taking stock of who you are and how others see you.
who am I?
it's a chance to redefine yourself, to change expectations.
or to aim for who you want to be.
take a seat.
where have you been?
I was just out looking at the stars.
you were stargazing every night this week.
how about the truth now.
I've been sneaking out.
obviously.
Why?
to try things.
such as?
I've been testing myself.
getting stronger and faster.
I know I shouldn't let people see me, and that's why I do it at night.
I-I don't know what to say.
I expected that it would take you longer to get comfortable living here before we were ready.
we?
I have big plans for you, Jessi.
and I need you to be as strong and as smart as you can possibly be.
how do we start?
well, first thing's first.
you need to get some sleep.
we'll talk about it further in the morning.
okay.
Amanda. I'm sorry...
you have an instant message. Do you want to read it now?
listen.
who is this?
Amanda. What happened?
did your mother change her mind?
no.
I didn't get on the plane.
can you hide me?
come in.
attention. Please prepare for docking procedure.
there's a package for you, Miss Perkins.
they didn't leave a name.
said it was important. - Thank you.
I don't like this business you're getting yourself into.
I'll be just fine, Mr. Paley. You know what a careful girl I am.
I move my mouth, words come out, you don't hear.
I'm late for a movie. - I don't like it when you smile at me.
you don't like my smile?
I don't like what's behind it.
listen, Polly, six scientists are missing, probably dead.
somebody out there means business. I don't want you in the middle of it.
it's only a movie, Mr. Paley.
I'll bring you some popcorn.
toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
we must be over the rainbow.
you sent me this?
who are you?
what's this all about, Mr...? - Doctor.
Dr. Walter Jennings. I'm a research chemist.
I specialize in nucleic-acid emissions.
the bonding enzymes in proteus molecules which
the missing scientists. You said you knew who was next.
Yes, l
I have a deadline to meet, doctor.
I was one of seven scientists chosen to serve in a secret facility stationed outside of Berlin before the start of the First World War.
it was known only as Einheit Elf, "Unit 11."
we agreed never to discuss what went on behind those doors.
the things we were made to do there...
terrible things.
I shouldn't have come. - Now I know we're not in Kansas.
are you a good witch or a bad witch?
doctor, you said you knew who was next.
Yes.
don't you see?
there is only one left. - Who? Who is it, doctor?
me.
he's coming for me.
who? Who's coming?
Totenkopf.
it's Totenkopf.
there!
all citizens, attention.
new York City must be evacuated at once.
proceed in an orderly manner to the East River Drive.
all members of the police and fire department on leave or off duty shall report immediately to their precincts or company command.
this is urgent.
editor Paley. - Mr. Paley, it's me, Polly.
what's going on? They're calling for midtown to evacuate.
listen, Mr. Paley, I don't have much time.
I need you to dig up anything you can on a Dr. Walter Jennings and someone named Totenkopf.
an address, a phone number, anything you can find. It's important.
Totenkopf. Who is he?
he may have something to do with the missing scientists.
quick as you can.
Polly, listen to me. I want you to get out of there.
I want you to put the phone down, close your notepad and get the hell out of there.
wait a minute.
I can see something now coming into sight above the Palisades.
they're crossing Sixth Avenue.
fifth Avenue.
they're a hundred -- They're a hundred yards away.
Polly. Polly!
Oh, my God.
Polly!
Polly!
Polly!
stop! Come back!
fire!
get out of here!
they've broken through the perimeter. Send reinforcements.
send everything you've got!
emergency protocol 90206. Calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
repeat. Calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
this is an emergency protocol, 90206.
calling Sky Captain. Sky Captain, do you read?
calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
this is an emergency protocol, 90206.
calling Sky Captain. Sky Captain, do you read?
repeat. Calling Sky Captain. Come in, Sky Captain.
this is Sky Captain. I'm on my way.
Polly.
Joe.
further details of the attack continue to pour in.
the central portion of the city is blacked out from radio communication due to damaged power lines and electrical failure.
cables received from English, French and German news agencies now confirm the attack was not limited to the city.
the BBC is reporting that a steel mill in Nuremberg was virtually excavated by what witnesses describe as a mechanized tornado.
news agencies in Paris and Madrid speak of strange burrowing machines rising from the ground, robbing entire communities of their coal and oil reserves.
meanwhile, with military resources stretched thin across the globe, world leaders must once again call upon the elite mercenary forces of Sky Captain and his army-for-hire to uncover the meaning of these mysterious events.
Where's Dex?
shazam.
I thought you said this thing was big. Can I have it?
you find out where it came from, and I'll buy you one for Christmas.
Oh, I need to show you something.
I recorded this signal just before the first machine appeared.
I didn't think anything of it until I played it back.
Morse code? - See, that's what I thought at first, but the syntax is more complex than that.
there's a sub-carrier hidden in the lower frequency.
I think it's being used to control them.
if it shows up again, could you track it?
I can try, yeah.
good boy, Dex. - Thanks.
in the meantime, see what you can do with that thing.
find out what makes it tick.
you don't mind, do you? - I don't mind.
I wanna know where it comes from, Dex. Who sent it here.
switch to map coordinate 69 SW by 49 E.
tummy ache?
how you been, Joe?
miss me? - Get out.
well, it's nice to see you too.
Dex said you might be in a mood.
Dex?
get in here!
it's been three years, Joe. You're not still mad at me, are you?
can't even remember what we were fighting about.
you sabotaged my plane.
right.
I spent six months in a Manchurian slave camp because of you.
they were gonna cut off my fingers. - Joe, for the last time, I didn't sabotage your damn airplane.
all so you could get a photograph of Tojo Hideki in his bathrobe, remember?
you know, I'm starting to think that you've invented this whole sabotage nonsense to cover the fact that you were running around on me with your little mystery girl the whole time we were in Nanjing.
never happened. All in your imagination.
who was she, Joe?
what was her name? - That's enough.
what are you gonna do?
shoot me?
it's been a pleasure, Polly.
let's do it again in ten years. Escort Miss Perkins off the base, Dex.
if she resists, shoot her.
Hi, Polly. - Hi, Dex.
I gotta... - It's okay, hon, I know.
okay.
it's just as well. I guess you wouldn't have been interested in this, anyway.
where did you get that? - There's more where this came from.
lots more.
I want that blueprint, Polly. - I want this story, Joe.
and you're gonna help me get it.
maybe we should show her, Cap. Maybe she can help.
show me what?
show me what?
my God. What is this?
where do they come from?
they started appearing three years ago in remote areas.
we managed to keep it a secret until now.
they show up without warning, they take what they need, and then they disappear without a trace.
three years and we still can't explain what they want or who's sending them here.
a man came to see me today, a scientist.
he was terrified. Said someone was coming for him.
I asked him who he was so afraid of, and he repeated one name:
Totenkopf.
he nearly went white when he said it.
Totenkopf, who is he?
he's the invisible man.
I've been through every library record twice looking for anything.
I've called every contact I have from Paris to Bangkok.
this is the only thing I could dig up.
he ran some kind of secret science unit outside of Berlin before the start of World War l.
something called Unit 11.
it's been more than 30 years since anyone has spoken his name.
until today.
note the insignia he used for the unit.
it matches the markings on all of these machines.
the scientist, where is he now?
we're in this together, right, Joe?
nothing gets published until I say so. You don't write a sentence or take a photograph without asking me first. Understood?
understood.
what?
I missed you.
thanks for saving my life today, by the way.
were you down there?
you missed me too. How nice.
this is it. This is Jennings' lab.
Dr. Jennings? It's Polly Perkins.
Dr. Jennings!
it's locked.
that window there.
I may be able to get in through that window if I can attach a line...
it's open.
we're too late. Someone beat us here.
all right, Polly...
...no more games. What the hell is going on?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Dr. Jennings!
you must stop him!
stay here.
stop!
I don't wanna hurt you.
miss Perkins. - I'm here, doctor.
I'm going to get you some help. - You must promise.
if Totenkopf finds them, the countdown will begin.
this world shall end. - I don't understand, doctor. Find what?
promise.
he's dead.
I think I found something.
Dr. Jennings had this with him this morning at the theater.
I'd better get back to the base. - I'm coming with you.
of course you are.
reconnaissance picked up something on radar traveling at over 500 knots and coming straight for us.
how long before they reach us? - There!
get my plane ready. I'm going up.
what are you doing? - I'm coming with you.
don't be stupid. Remember what happened last time you flew with me?
we had a deal. - This is not a game, Polly.
people are gonna die. - You are not leaving me, Joe.
not this time. This is my story, and we had a deal!
go, go, go!
get in.
there you are.
cap, this is Dex, do you read me? - Hang on, Dex, I'm a little busy.
come in, Dex.
look, whatever you do, don't shoot!
okay. - You shot it, didn't you?
Yes. - Listen, Cap, the signal's coming from one of those machines.
you gotta keep them in one piece.
which machine is it, Dex?
there's no way of telling. It could be any one of them.
I think I found it, Dex.
wait, Cap, I'm losing the signal. - It's heading for the city.
don't let it get away. I need you to bounce that signal back to me.
if we lose it now, we may never get it back.
you let me know when you've got something, Dex.
I'll let you know. Out.
all right, I want a full-spectrum sweep of every incoming signal.
amplify any variant frequency cycle and route them to me.
they've come back for the generators.
who is this guy?
you okay? - Great.
there's a bottle of Milk of Magnesia under the seat if you need it.
I'm fine. - You don't look so good.
pull up!
Joe! - I see it!
it's getting away.
I lost the signal, Cap. - I'll find him, Dex. Sit tight.
go left. - Sit back, Polly.
there's a shortcut down Broadway. You can catch him on 42nd Street.
I know these streets like the back of my hand. Go left!
Hey!
okay, okay, now go straight.
no, no, no, go right! - When?
back there.
I could use a little more warning next time.
go left!
tell me you got something, Dex.
we're getting clobbered up here.
it's no picnic down here either, Cap. Hang in there, I've almost got it.
Joe!
Dex! We can't hold them off any longer!
I'm almost there. - We have to evacuate now!
go ahead without me. I'm right behind you.
lovely. - Okay, turn left at the drugstore.
left again. - We're going around in circles.
will you just trust me? Go left!
it's a dead end. - That's not supposed to be there.
it's a dead end!
there's no way out!
Oh, bugger.
Joe!
there's the lead ship. - Shortcut!
I got us here, didn't l?
Dex. Dex! - Thirty seconds, Cap, that's all I need.
thirty seconds. - Plus or minus.
listen, I'll try and take them out over the water, buy us some time. Over.
still glad you came?
Joe, I found it! Joe!
Dex, come in. Where is it?
come in, Dex. Are you there? Dex?
Dex, do you read me?
Dex, are you there?
I can't outrun them much longer.
hold on.
Joe, what are you doing? You're heading straight down!
you're gonna kill us! - I know what I'm doing. Just hold on.
we're going too fast. We're not gonna make it.
Joe, you have to pull up!
pull up!
we went underwater. - Dex rigged it up.
got the idea from one of his comic books.
you mean, you knew this the whole time, and you let me think we were gonna crash?
I thought we were gonna die! You should have said something!
look, Polly, it was your idea to tag along, not mine.
if you can't take it, that's not my fault.
Oh, I can take it.
I can take anything you dish out. - Good.
because that was nothing.
Dex, come in. Do you read me?
do you read me, Dex? Copy.
Dex!
Dex!
Dex.
they're everywhere.
Joe, look out!
Dex!
why would Totenkopf do this?
why Dex? It doesn't make any sense.
he was looking for something.
Dex said he knew where the transmission was coming from.
he must have got too close.
he was trying to tell me something - Joe.
good boy, Dex.
these journals belong to Dr. Vargas.
he must have passed them on to Dr. Jennings before his disappearance.
my God. - What?
Totenkopf was awarded his first patent when he was 1 2 years old.
by 1 7, he had already received two doctorates and was one of the most highly regarded minds of his day.
one year after his disappearance, ominous rumors began circulating.
whispers that Totenkopf had begun work on what was darkly hinted to be a doomsday device.
efforts to locate him have consistently failed, and to this day, his whereabouts remain a mystery.
even less is known about his companion, an assassin who controls his machines.
she's the one who took Dex.
what else?
these are Unit 1 1 supply logs.
this is everything he's used his machines to collect for the last three years, including generators from the city.
it reads like a shopping list from all over the world.
what have you been up to, doctor?
it'll be all right, Joe. Dex can look after himself.
we'll find him.
my old friend Joe.
so glad to see you again. - It's good to see you too, Kaji.
so glad to see you again. - It's good to see you too, Kaji.
this is Polly Perkins. She'll be coming with us.
nice to meet you.
Kaji, did you get the maps I needed? - Yeah, they're inside.
did you get a little something for me?
of course. Three cases, just like you asked.
Vienna sausages. My God, it's been so long.
Kaji, how's your Tibetan?
come, I'll show you the maps.
how well do you know him? - Kaji?
he's old legion. Reconnaissance. Why?
I don't trust him.
that's funny, he said the same thing about you.
here. Get changed. Your clothes stay behind.
you won't be needing high heels where we're going.
Dex tracked the signal to here, this valley north of Karakal.
this is where the transmission originated.
why is there no writing here? What is this place?
Shambhala. - You know it?
it is forbidden.
it's said to be the source of the Kalachakra, Tibetan magic.
those who live there are said to have supernatural powers.
you can get us there, Kaji, can't you?
no one has ventured this far. It's very dangerous.
Shambhala is said to be protected by the priests of the Kalachakra lamasery.
if they find us there, they will kill us.
Why? Why is this place so special?
Shambhala is known by many names. To the Hebrew, it is Eden.
to the ancient Greek, it was Empurios.
you may know it as Shangri-la.
a storm is coming. If you still wish to go, we must go now.
I need to send a message.
editor Paley, this may be the last message you receive from me.
we've tracked a radio signal to Nepal in search of Dr. Totenkopf.
the story grows stranger at every turn.
clues about a countdown. But to what, I don't know.
I fear time is running out.
with any luck, I'll be back soon with Dex and the story.
I hope. Polly Perkins.
this is where civilization stops.
a blank on the map.
we must be careful from here.
hurry.
what is it?
it looks like a mining outpost.
something bad happened here.
seems to be abandoned.
tell your men we're heading down.
I want a closer look.
what is it, Joe?
uranium.
the whole mine's contaminated.
we can't stay here. - Let's go.
Where's Polly?
Polly!
miss Perkins?
we'll have to split up.
Polly!
let her go.
give me the vials and the girl will live.
what vials? What are you talking about?
I will not ask a second time.
drop the gun.
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about. You'll just have to kill us.
as you wish.
wait! Wait. Wait.
I'm sorry, Joe.
goodbye, my friends. Your journey ends here.
I was going to tell you, Joe. You have to believe me.
what was in those vials? - I don't know.
you expect me to believe that? - I'm telling the truth, Joe.
Dr. Jennings gave them to me just before he died.
he said that the world would end and the countdown would begin if Totenkopf got his hands on them.
you've done nothing but lie to me from the beginning.
okay, I'm a liar. But I don't exaggerate. That is what he said.
that was what Totenkopf was looking for.
that's why he took Dex. - I'm sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
do you hear that?
dynamite.
that noise again.
move!
what are you doing?
come on!
Oh, great.
we're safe.
Polly, this may be our last moment together.
there's something I need to ask you.
Yes, Joe?
did you cut my fuel line?
damn it! I didn't sabotage your lousy airplane!
our last moments on earth and this is all you have to say to me?
could we just for once die without all this bickering?
there you are.
why did you lock the door? - Run!
my film.
Polly, leave it! There's no time!
Polly.
Polly.
my clothes.
what are you doing in here? Get out. Get out!
not unless you have some pants hidden under there for me.
Oh, don't tell me you're - Naked.
you can say it, Polly. - This isn't funny, Joe.
where are we? What happened to us? Where are our clothes?
stop looking at me like that.
like what?
turn around, Joe.
I'm serious. Turn around.
Hi, Joe.
ask him what he did with our clothes.
the clothes are burned.
burned? Why?
he says the mine is poisonous.
our clothes were infected.
he says he's arranged for a guide to lead us back down the mountain.
he will take us there once we are dressed.
we appreciate that. But explain to him we are here to find a man.
he says we must leave before it is dark.
there's nothing more he can do for us.
it's very important we find this man.
his name is Totenkopf!
he says, what do you want with this man?
I've come to kill him.
and to find my friend.
he says he will help you.
what do you think?
I think they burned the wrong clothes.
you said I couldn't bring anything else.
I think you look like a woolly mammoth.
they're waiting for us.
the priest says that Totenkopf enslaved his people, made them work in the mine, but the mine was poisonous.
those who did not die right away were brought here for him to study.
where is Totenkopf now?
he does not know. Only that Totenkopf is gone, many years ago.
I can't believe this is happening.
I only have two shots left.
we're in Shangri-la and all I have is two shots.
everything I had was in that bag.
you should have let me go back for my film.
you're right, I should have.
so where's he taking us?
to meet the only living survivor of Totenkopf's experiments.
what experiments?
ask him, where is Totenkopf? Tell him it's important we find him.
he wants to know why. Why do you seek Totenkopf?
to make him pay for what he has done.
his staff. He's asking for his staff.
he says, follow Rana. The staff will lead you there to Totenkopf.
Rana? Is there such a place?
he says now that he has helped you, you must help him.
of course. Anything.
what do you want?
kill me.
have you looked at this? There's markings on it, like a ruler.
and there's a moon and a star.
and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by.
a star.
he wasn't talking about a place, he was talking about a star!
rana is a star.
ancient sailors used to navigate by using the night sky.
they could determine their position by the moon and the stars.
the Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
the Vikings were known to create maps for certain stars,
latitude tables that required a key to decipher them.
the key was called Jacob's staff. This has to be the key!
you mean this could really work?
you could really find Totenkopf with this thing?
we do things a little different nowadays.
all we needed to know was where to look. What's the date?
march 2. - March 2.
using Karakal Plateau as our assumed position...
march 2...
rana is at latitude 20. 40.
right ascension, 03 hours, 43 minutes.
Declination, minus 10. 60.
there's nothing there.
are you sure you did it right?
I'm sure.
if the old man was right, that's where Totenkopf is now.
dead center in the middle of nowhere.
what's that point there?
that's where we run out of fuel.
Oh, great.
so how do we get there?
Franky. - Who?
Frank Cook. An old buddy of mine.
runs a mobile reconnaissance outpost for the Royal Navy.
if I can get a message to them,
I may be able to arrange a rendezvous at these coordinates.
and what if they don't get the message?
franky's never let me down. They'll be there.
they'll be there.
is that light supposed to be on?
relax, Polly, everything's fine.
we're out of fuel, aren't we? - Buckle up.
manta Station, do you read me?
where are you, Franky?
what are you doing?
you can't land this in the middle of nowhere.
I'm not. I'm landing it on that.
what is it? - It's a mobile airstrip.
Dex had a hand in designing it.
it's kind of a secret. You can keep a secret, can't you, Polly?
Yeah.
I can keep a secret.
two shots.
permission to land on platform 327. Maintain your present course.
copy, 327.
welcome aboard, captain.
joseph Sullivan. I was sure you'd be dead by now.
it's good to see you too, Franky.
this had better be important or one of us is in trouble.
it's important.
what is that?
you be nice.
commander Cook, meet Polly Perkins.
Polly Perkins. I've heard so much about you.
it's a pleasure to finally meet the competition.
it's been a long time since Nanjing, hasn't it, Joseph?
so, Franky, I hear you've been having trouble with that number-three engine, or at least you were last time
commander, we're tracking six enemy submersibles bearing 30 degrees northwest.
who wants to kill you now? - Man your battle stations.
all hands on deck. - Follow me.
take us to 1 0, 000 feet and deploy countermeasures.
Yes, commander.
reconnaissance located an island 3 kilometers northeast of our current position.
it is not, however, on any of our charts.
that has to be him. - That has to be who?
what have you got me into this time, Joseph?
nothing you can't handle, Franky.
Polly, try not to touch anything.
enemy warships bearing 316, mark 4. Closing fast.
give me a visual. - Launching radio imager.
we're receiving a signal. On-screen now.
Totenkopf.
commander, we've lost power to the forward rotors. We're losing altitude.
all engines, reverse full. Get us out of here.
francesca, you've got to get me on that island.
I'm not about to risk the lives of my men for one of your silly antics.
he's got Dex.
rescind order!
you'll never make it from the air. We have to find you another way.
there's a tidal flow on the eastern face of the island.
it's too deep. We're not rated past 300 meters.
but...
...this area here, there's an undersea inlet at the southern tip and it runs beneath the entire length of the island. That is your only way in.
everything else is sheer rock to the edge of the water.
what about those machines? How do we get past them?
leave that to me.
alert the amphibious squadron.
report to main station carrier.
what?
Nanjing?
I can't hear you, Polly.
you'll have to speak up.
keep your nose up, Joseph. You always were bad at the short takeoff.
keep up, Franky. I don't wanna have to come back for you.
I thought your takeoff was just fine.
thank you, Polly.
so you heard that, did you?
manta leader to Manta team, impact in ten seconds.
switching to amphibious mode.
impact in five, four, three,
Franky.
you remember our milk run over Shanghai, don't you?
we had the target buttoned up and he was jinxing in the flak.
pops a rivet, thinks he's taken a hit. - And started yelling:
protect the rabbits! - Protect the rabbits!
protect the rabbits!" - Protect the rabbits!
enemy target spotted four points to the right. Depth, 1, 600. Look sharp.
Joe, watch out!
Joseph, there's the inlet. - I see it.
get ready to make a run for it. We're about to clear you a path.
hold on, now, Polly. Hold on.
manta leader to Manta team, arm cluster torpedoes and stick close to element formation.
fire.
Joseph! Pull up!
Joseph, it's still alive. Disengage.
do you hear me? Disengage.
do you hear me?
what is it? - Do you hear me? Pull up!
the rudder's jammed. I can't steer. - Joseph!
Disengage!
thank you, Franky. That was close. - Get ready to make a run for it.
you're only going to have one shot at this.
Franky, what are you doing? This is no time to show off.
she's heading straight for it. - On my mark.
she's going to ram it. - It's suicide.
Franky, pull up.
three. - Pull up, Franky.
you're all clear.
good luck, Joe.
thank you, Franky. We'll take it from here.
she's some kind of girl.
Yes, I know.
I'm taking us up.
what?
what is it? - One of Totenkopf's creatures.
you're not gonna photograph that? - I've only got two shots left.
who knows what's waiting for us out there.
suit yourself.
there's a clearing up ahead. Totenkopf can't be far.
run.
there.
Polly!
Oh, great.
come on!
Polly!
come on!
are you mad?
are you mad?
are you completely insane? You could have gotten yourself killed!
it's okay. - No, it isn't.
I didn't mean-- - I shot the ground!
what? - When we were running,
I shot the ground.
it isn't funny.
I only have one shot left. One shot!
what is it with you and that stupid camera, anyway?
you gave it to me.
you don't even remember, do you?
you were flying with the American volunteers in Nanjing,
I was covering the evacuation of Shanghai.
I remember. - Joe, I wanna ask you something and I want you to tell me the truth.
I don't care one way or the other, I swear. I just need to know.
the girl in Nanjing was Franky, wasn't it?
Polly. - How long were you seeing her?
look me in the eyes.
I never fooled around on you.
never.
I sabotaged your plane.
three months. - I knew it!
I can't believe I ever trusted you, you lousy
he's here.
you all right?
through there.
through there.
my God, Joe.
it's an ark.
he's building an ark.
what are you doing?
you honestly think you're gonna find something more important than every single creature on Earth being led two by two inside a giant rocket ship?
I might.
like what? - I'll know when I see it.
ten minutes to liftoff. - They've started the countdown.
we have to find Totenkopf.
you've got a gift.
Dex! - Hurry, get in!
Komm, springt!
are you all right? How did you find us?
we escaped into the tunnels once the countdown started.
some of the scientists were caught. They didn't make it.
the machines that were guarding us are loading everything on this island into that ship.
we've got about ten minutes to stop that thing from blasting off.
Dex! Get us out of here!
good boy, Dex.
Thanks, Cap.
who are they? - They're Unit 11.
or what's left of them.
they were brought here to finish what they started 30 years ago.
finish what?
tell them.
Totenkopf believed that humankind was doomed to extinction, so he proposed the unthinkable:
to build a vessel that would carry the building blocks of a new civilization into space.
he used his machines to collect specimens representing all life on Earth.
what Totenkopf called "The World of Tomorrow."
those vials that Dr. Jennings gave me, what were they?
Adam and Eve. Totenkopf's masterpiece.
seeds of a technological utopia.
we smuggled them off this island, knowing Totenkopf would never leave without them.
but now that he has them again, there is nothing left to keep him here.
then let him go. Let him go where he can't harm anyone.
no, no, no, that ship must never leave this Earth.
Why? What haven't you told us?
when the rocket reaches 100 kilometers, at the edge of space, - Earth will be incinerated. - How do we stop it?
only Totenkopf can stop it now. But we've never been allowed near him.
he's too well guarded even to be seen.
where is he? - We're on our way, Cap.
good boy, Dex.
careful. Careful.
hurry, they'll be coming for us.
through there. That's the only way in.
you see, there is no way past them.
five minutes, Joe.
wait here. - You'll be killed.
he knows what he's doing.
I think.
Hey, that's my gun!
Dex? - Try shaking it.
we must hurry. - Don't do it, you idiot!
doctor, stop!
who dares come before me?
who dares enter this place?
what has begun cannot be stopped.
the time for this world is over. - Totenkopf.
Hello, doctor.
why are you doing this?
I have been witness to a world consumed by hatred and bent on self-destruction.
watched as we have taken what was to be a paradise and failed in our responsibilities as its steward.
I know now that the course the human race has set for itself cannot be changed.
I am the last, desperate chance for a doomed planet.
now, leave this place or die!
is it safe? - Well, there's only one way to find out.
I meant throw something.
he's not here.
we're too late.
these are his personal papers.
he would never leave without them. He must still be here.
we must find him. - I found him.
it's impossible.
it can't be.
the last entry in his journal was made on October 11, 1918.
he died over 20 years ago.
we've been chasing a ghost.
three minutes to liftoff.
they never stopped. They're finishing what they were programmed to do.
don't you see? This entire island is Totenkopf. Every wire, every gear.
he's found a way to cheat even his own death.
so how do we kill somebody who's already dead?
how do I stop it? - Nothing can stop it now.
there must be some way. - His machines would never allow it.
leave the machines to me. Dex, show me what to do.
if you can cut the lead in the system terminal, it should create a short...
...which will ignite the fuel line before the booster engines can fire - and destroy the atmosphere. - That's it?
that's all I have to do? - The terminal's on board the rocket.
you won't have time to escape.
contact Franky as soon as you're off the island.
she'll know exactly what to do. - What are you talking about?
I'm going with you. - Not this time.
we had a deal.
you're not gonna leave me now, just when things are getting interesting.
and I only hope, one day, you can forgive me.
take care of her, Dex. - Good luck, Cap.
one minute to liftoff.
we meet again, my mysterious friend.
how do you wanna do this?
nice shot, Polly.
what took you so long?
she's a machine.
ten seconds to liftoff.
we've gotta get those animals off the ship.
ninety kilometers to booster ignition.
there's no time.
that's our only way across.
eighty kilometers to booster ignition.
danger! Danger! Danger! Cargo release imminent!
what did you do now?
come on!
seventy kilometers to booster ignition.
sixty kilometers to booster ignition.
hold on!
please! Don't touch anything else!
there's no time. We'll never make it.
fifty kilometers to booster ignition.
run!
forty kilometers to booster ignition.
come in, Manta station. Do you read me?
thirty kilometers to booster ignition.
Franky, it's Dex. Do you read me?
it didn't work.
twenty kilometers to booster ignition.
Joe, you're running out of time. You've gotta do something.
and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth...
he thinks he's God. - And God said unto Noah, the end...
shut up!
ten kilometers to booster ignition.
...six... - Why won't you die?
five kilometers to booster ignition.
watch it! -Sorry, darling.
here you are. -Thank you.
mind if I join you?
I'll have the same.
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf.
Gandalf the Grey.
I know who you are.
well, now, this is a fine chance.
what brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?
I receive words that my father have been seen wandering in the wilds near Dunland.
I went looking, found no sign of him.
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.
he still lives, I am sure of it.
my father came to see you before he went missing.
what did you say to him?
I urged him to march upon Erebor.
to gather the seven armies of dwarves.
to destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.
and I would say the same to you, take back your homeland.
this is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?
no.
it is not.
the Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.
that dragon has sat there long enough.
sooner or later, darker minds will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst travelling along Greenway.
they mistook me for a vagabond.
I imagine they regretted that.
one of them was carrying a message.
it is Black Speech.
he promised as payment. -For what?
your head.
someone wants you dead.
Thorin, you could wait no longer, you are the heir to the throne of Durin.
unite the armies of the Dwarves.
together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.
summon a meeting of the seven Dwarf families, demand they stand by their oath.
the Seven Armies sworn an oath to the one who wields the King's Jewel, the Arkenstone.
it is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.
what if I were to help you reclaim it?
how? The Arkenstone lies half a world away, buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.
Yes.
which is why we're going to need a burglar.
how close is the pack? -Too close.
couple of leagues, no more.
but that's not the worst of it.
they will smell us, pick our scent.
not yet but they will do.
we have another problem.
did they see you?
they saw you? -No. That's not it.
what did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse.
excellent burglar material.
would you listen? Will you just listen?
I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.
what form did it take, like a bear?
Yes, but bigger, much bigger.
you knew about this beast?
I say we double back.
we will be run down by a pack of wolves.
there is a house, it's not far from here, where we might take refuge.
whose house?
a friend or foe? -Neither.
he will help us, or, he will kill us.
what choice do we have?
none.
this way, quickly!
move!
come on.
in the house!
run!
come on, get inside.
open the door!
quickly.
push!
come on!
what is that?
that is our host.
his name is Beorn.
and he's a skin-changer.
sometimes he's a huge black bear, sometimes he's a great strong man.
the bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with.
however, he's not over fond of Dwarves.
he's leaving. -Come away from there!
it's not natural, none of it!
it's obvious, he's under some dark spell.
don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.
all right, now. Get some sleep, all of you.
you'll be safe here tonight.
I hope.

so you are the one they call Oakenshield.
tell me, why is Azorg the Defiler hunting you?
you know of Azorg. How?
my people were the first to live in the mountains.
before the Orcs came down from the north.
the Defiler killed most of my family.
but some he enslaved.
not for work, you understand?
but for sport.
caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.
there are others like you?
once there were many.
and now?
now there's only one.
you need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.
before Durin's Day falls, yes.
you're running out of time.
which is why we must go through Mirkwood.
a darkness lies upon that forest.
foul things creep beneath those trees.
there is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I would not venture there, except in great need.
we will take the Elven road. That path is too safe.
safe?
the Wood-elves in Mirkwood are not like their kin.
they're less wise and more dangerous.
but it matters not.
what do you mean?
these lands are crawling with Orcs.
their numbers are growing.
and you're on foot, you will never reach the forest alive.
I don't like Dwarves.
they are greedy, and blind.
blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.
but Orcs I hate more.
what do you need?
go now, while you have the light.
your hunters are not far behind.
the Elven Gate.
here lies our path through Mirkwood.
no sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.
set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.
this forest feels...
sick.
as if there's a disease lies upon it.
is there no way around?
not unless we go to 200 miles north, or twice that distance...south.
something moves in the shadows unseen, hidden from our sight.
every day it grows in strength.
beware the Necromancer.
he's not what he seems.
if our enemy has returned, we must know.
go to the tombs in the mountains.
the High Fells.
so be it.
not my horse, I need it.
you're not leaving us?
I will not do this unless I had to.
you've changed. Bilbo Baggins.
and not the same Hobbit as the one who left Shire.
I was going to tell you...
I found something in the Goblin Tunnels.
found what?
what did you find?
my courage.
good. Well that's good.
you need it.
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook before the slopes of Erebor.
keep the map and key safe.
do not enter the Mountain without me.
this is not the Greenwood.
although the very air of the forest is heavy with illusion that'll see to enter your mind...
and lead you astray.
lead us astray?
what does that mean?
you must stay on the path, do not leave it.
if you do, you'll never find it again.
no matter what may come, stay on the path!
come on, we must reach the mountain before the sunset on Durin's Day.
Durin's Day?
let's go. -We have one chance to find the hidden door .
the path goes this way.
this way.
air. I need air.
my head, it's spinning. What's happening?
we're moving. -Nori.
why have we stopped?
the path, it's disappeared.
what's going on?
we've lost the path.
find it. All of you, look! Look for the path!
I don't remember this place, none of it is familiar.
where is it?
we do not know. We do not even know what it is.
look, a tobacco pouch.
there's Dwarves in these woods.
dwarves in the Blue Mountains no less.
this is exactly the same as mine.
because it is yours.
you understand? We are going round in circles, we are lost.
we're not lost, we keep heading east.
but which way is the east?
we've lost the sun.
the sun, we have to find the sun.
up there.
what's that?
enough! Quiet, all of you!
we're being watched.
I, I can see a lake.
and a river, and the Lonely Mountain.
we're almost there.
can you hear me?
I know which way to go.
Hello?
hello.
no, come on!
eat them now, none is running.
his hide is tough, this could be juicy inside.
finish it.
he's alive, you didn't kill him.
kill him now!
feast!
feast!
what is it?
fair terms, you see.
just a little taste.
where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
here.
it stings, stings!
sting?
it's a good name.
sting.
I'm all right. -Where's Bilbo?
Bilbo. -I'm up here.
haul!
where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
No!
Gloin! Kili!
kill them all!
Kili!
mine.
come on, keep up!
do not think I will not kill you, Dwarf.
it would be my pleasure.
No! -Kili!
throw me your dagger!
quick!
did you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf?
you're mistaken!
search them.
Hey, give it back, that's private!
who is this? Your brother?
that is my wife!
and what is this horrid creature, a Goblin-mutant?
that's my wee lad, Gimli!
where did you get this?
it was given to me.
not just a thief but a liar as well.
Enwenno hain!
Thorin, where's Bilbo?
this is not the end of it!
aren't you going to search me?
I could have anything down my trousers.
or nothing.
leave it!
there is no way out, this is no Orc dungeon.
these are holes of the Woodland Realm.
no one leaves here but by the King's consent.
some imagine that a noble quest is at hand.
a quest to reclaim a homeland, and slay a dragon.
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.
attempted burglary or something of that ilk.
you have found a way in.
you seek that which would bestow upon you, the right to rule.
the King's Jewel.
the Arkenstone.
it is precious to you beyond measure.
I understand that.
the gems in the Mountain that I, too, desire...
white gems, a pure starlight.
I offer you my help.
I'm listening.
I would let you go, if you but return what is mine.
a favor for a favor.
have my word, one king to another.
I would not trust Thranduil, a great king to honor his words till the end of all days be upon us.
you lack all honor!
I've seen how you treat your friends.
we came to you once, starving, homeless , seeking your help.
but you turned your back.
you turned away from the suffering of my people.
the inferno that destroyed us.
Imrid amrad ursul!
do not talk to me of dragon fire.
I know its wrath and ruin.
I have faced the great serpents of the north.
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon.
but he would not listen.
you are just like him.
stay here if you will, and rot.
100 years is a mere blink in the life of an Elf.
I am patient. I can wait.
did he offer you a deal? -He did.
him and all his kin!
that's that, then.
the deal was our only hope.
not our only hope.
I know you're there.
why do you linger in the shadows?
I was coming to report to you.
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not 2 moons past.
we cleared the forest as ordered, my lord.
but more spiders keep coming up from the south.
they are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur.
if we could kill them at their source...
the fortress lies beyond our borders.
keep our lands clear of those foul creatures.
that is your task.
and when we drive them off? What then?
will they not spread to other lands?
other lands are not my concern.
fortunes of the world will rise and fall.
but here in this kingdom, we will endure.
legolas said you fought well today.
he's grown very fond of you.
I assure you, my lord.
legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.
perhaps he did once.
now I'm not so sure.
I do not think you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.
no, you're right. I would not.
still, he cares about you.
do not give him hope where there is none.
the stone in your hand, what is it?
it is a talisman.
a powerful spell lies upon it, if any but a Dwarf reads the runes on this stone...
they will be forever cursed.
or not.
depending on whether you believe.
this kind of thing is just a token.
a rune stone.
my mother gave it to me so I'd remember my promise.
what promise?
that I would come back to her.
she worries.
she thinks I'm reckless.
are you?
sounds like quite a party having out there.
it is mereth en gilith.
the feast of starlight.
all light is sacred to the Eldar.
but Wood Elves love best for light of the stars.
I always thought it is a cold light.
remote and far away.
it is memory.
precious and pure.
like your promise.
I have walked there sometimes.
beyond the forest and up into the night.
I have seen the world full away.
and the white light forever fill the air.
I saw fire moon once.
the roads of the path near Dunland.
huge, red and golden it was, filled the sky.
we were an escort for some merchants in Mindolluin, they were trading in silver work for furs.
we took the Greenway south.
keeping the mountain to our left.
at the end of the day, you see huge fire moon lighting our path.
we're running out of drink.
these empty barrels should be sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.
bargeman would be waiting for them.
say what you like, but the ill-tempered king has this excellent, tasty wine.
come on, Ross, try it. -I have the Dwarves in my charge.
they're locked up, where can they go?
I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.
we never gonna reach the mountain, are we?
not stuck in here, you know?
Bilbo.
there are guards nearby.
what's this?
you first.
Ori. -Not that way. Down here, follow me!
this way.
come. -I don't believe we're in the cellars!
you're supposed to be leading us out now for the road!
I know what I'm doing.
this way.
everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!
are you mad? They'll find us.
no, no, they won't. I promise you!
please, please, you must trust me!
do as he says.
what do we do now?
hold your breath.
hold my breath? What do you mean?
where is the keeper of the keys?
welcome, Master Baggins.
come on, let's go.
hold on!
Bilbo!
hang on.
no. Help!
No!
watch out!
get on to the bridge!
Kili?
Kili?
Kili?
nori!
come along!
Bombur!
Oh, it's you.
why am I here, Gandalf?
trust me, Radagast.
I would not have called you here without a good reason.
this is not a nice place to meet.
no. It is not.
these are dark spells, Gandalf.
old, and full of hate.
who's buried here?
if he had name, it's long since been lost.
he would have been known only as a servant of evil.
one of nine.
why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.
the Ring-wraiths is summoned to Dol Guldur.
but it can not be the Necromancer.
a human sorcerer could not summon such evil.
who said it was human?
the Nine only answer to one master.
we've been blind, Radagast.
and in our blindness the enemy has returned.
he's summoning his servants.
Azorg the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.
he's a commander, a commander of legions.
the enemy is preparing for war.
it will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.
where are you going?
to rejoin the others. -Gandalf.
I started this, I can not forsake them.
they are in grave danger.
if what you say is true...
the world is in grave danger.
the power in that fortress will only grow stronger.
you want me to cast my friends aside.
anything behind us? -Not that I can see.
I think we've outrun the Orcs.
not for long.
we've lost the current.
make for the shore. Come on, let's go.
come on.
I'm fine. It's nothing.
on your feet. -Kili's wounded, his leg needs binding.
there's an Orc pack on our tail. We keep moving.
to where? -To the mountain, we're so close.
a lake lies between us and that mountain.
we have no way to cross it.
so then we go around. -The Orcs'll run us down, as sure as daylight.
we have no weapon to defend ourselves.
bind his legs quickly. You have 2 minutes.
do it again...and you're dead.
excuse me, but, um...you're from Lake-town, if I'm not mistaken?
that barge over there, is it available for hire by any chance?
what makes you think I would help you?
those boots have seen better days.
as has that coat.
no doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed.
how many bearings?
a boy and two girls.
and your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.
aye, she was.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
come on, come on. Enough for the niceties!
what's your hurry?
what's it to you?
I would like to know who you are.
and what you are doing in these lands.
we are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains.
journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.
simple merchants you say.
we need food, supplies, weapons.
can you help us?
I know where these barrels came from.
what of it?
I don't know what business you had with the Elves.
but I don't think it ended well.
no one enters Lake-town but by lead of The Master.
all his wealth comes from trades with the Woodland Realm.
he would see you in irons before risking the wraith of king Thranduil.
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.
Aye.
but for that, you would need a smuggler.
for which we will pay, double.
such is the nature of evil.
out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.
a shadow that grows in the dark.
a sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.
so it ever was. So will it always be.
in time, all foul things come forth.
you were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.
Why?
not 13.
not any more.
the young one, the black-haired archer.
we stuck him of a Morgul shaft.
poison is in his blood, he'll be choking on it soon.
answer the question, filth.
I would not antagonize her.
you like killing things, Orc?
you like death?
then let me give it to you!
I do not care about one dead Dwarf. Answer the question.
you have nothing to fear.
tell us what you know and I will set you free.
you had orders to kill them, Why?
what is Thorin Oakenshield to you?
the Dwarf runt will never be king.
king? There's no King Under the Mountain.
nor will there ever be. None would they enter Erebor whilst the dragon lives.
you know nothing.
your world will burn.
what are you talking about?
speak!
our time has come again.
my master serves the One.
do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you.
the flames of war are upon you.
why did you do that?
you promised to set him free.
and I did.
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.
there was more the Orc could tell us.
there was nothing more he could tell me.
what did he mean by the flames of war?
it means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.
nothing moves that I hear of it.
no one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.
watch out!
what are you trying to do? Drown us?
I was born and bred on these waters , master Dwarf.
if I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.
Oh, I've had enough of this slippy lake-man.
I say we throw him over the sail and then we dump him.
bard, his name is Bard.
how do you know?
um, I asked him.
I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.
we do not have to like him. We simply have to pay him.
come now lads, turn out your pockets.
how do we know he won't betray us?
we don't.
there's um, still a big problem.
we're 10 coins short.
Gloin, come on. Give us what you have.
don't look to me.
I've been bled dry by this venture.
what have I seen from my investment?
naught but misery and grief and...
bless my beard.
take it, take all of it.
the money, quick, give it to me.
we will pay you when we get our provisions, but not before.
if you value your freedom, you'll do as I say.
there are guards ahead.
what's he doing?
he's talking to someone.
he's pointing right at us.
now they're shaking hands.
what?
the villain!
he's selling us out.
quiet!
we're approaching the tollgate.
halt. Goods inspection. Papers, please.
Oh, it's you, Bard.
morning, Percy.
anything to declare?
nothing, that I am cold and tired, and ready for home.
you and me both.
here we are, all in order.
not so fast.
consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm.
only, they are not empty, are they, Bard?
if I recall correctly. Your licensed as a bargeman.
not a fisherman.
that's none of your business!
wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.
Oh, come on, Alfred, Have a heart. People need to eat!
these fish are illegal.
empty the barrels over the side. -You heard him.
in the canal.
come on.
folks in this town are struggling.
times are hard, food is scarce.
that's not my problem.
and when the people hear their Master's dumping the fish in the lake, when the rioting starts,
will it be your problem, then?
stop!
ever the people's champion, aye, Bard? Protector of the common folk.
you might have their favor now, bargeman. But it won't last.
raise the gate.
the Master has his eye on you, you do well to remember.
we know where you live.
it's a small town, Alfred. Everyone knows where everyone lives.
all these talks of civil are unrest.
someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.
gout playing ox, Sire?
it's the damp, it's the only possible explanation. Get me a brandy.
the mood of the people, sire, is turning ugly.
they're commoners, Alfred. They've always been ugly.
it's not my fault that they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar.
jobs, shelter, food, that's all they ever plead about.
it is my belief, sire, that they've been led on by trouble makers.
then we must find these trouble makers, and arrest them.
my thoughts exactly, sire.
and all these talks of change must be suppressed.
what a fault to let the rebel banded together and start making noises.
the next thing you know, they'll start asking questions, forming commities...
launching inquiries.
out with the old, in with the new.
what?
that's what I've been saying, sire.
there's even talk of election.
election? It's absurd. I won't stand for it.
I don't think they'll ask you to stand, sire.
Sackers, ingrates, rebel-rousers.
who would have the nerve to question my authority!
who would dare? Who...
bard.
you mark my words, that trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.
get your hands off me.
you didn't see them. They were never here.
fish you can have for nothing.
follow me.
da, our house, it's being watched.
you can tell the Master I'm done for the day.
da.
where have you been?
father, there you are! I was worried.
Yes. Bain, get them in.
if you speak of this to anyone. I'll rip your arms off.
off.
out there.
da, why are the Dwarves climbing out from our toilet?
will they bring us luck?
they may not be the best fit, but they'll keep you warm.
thank you.
the Dwarvish Windlass.
you look like you've seen a ghost.
Yes. The last time we saw such a weapon, a city was on fire.
it was the day the dragon came.
the day that Smaug destroyed Dale.
Girion, the Lord of the city.
rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.
but a dragon's hide is tough. Tougher than the strongest armor.
only a black arrow fired from a Windlass would pierce the dragon hide.
and few of those arrows were ever made.
the store was running low when Girion made his last stand.
had the aim of men been true that day...
much would've been different.
you speak as if you were there?
all Dwarves know the tale.
and you would know that Girion hit the dragon?
it loosened the scale on the left wing one more shot he would have killed the beast.
that's fairy story, lad. Nothing more.
you took all our money.
where are the weapons?
wait here.
tomorrow begins our last day of autumn.
Durin's day falls the morning after next.
we must reach the mountain before then.
and if we do not?
if we fail to find the hidden door before that time?
then this quest has been for nothing.
what is this?
pike hook.
made from an old harpoon.
and this?
a crowbill, we call it. Expansion from smittys hammer.
it's heavy in hand, I grant.
but in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.
we paid you for weapons.
iron forged, swords of dark sheath.
it's a joke.
you won't find better outside the city armory.
all iron-forged weapons are held there and locked in key.
Thorin.
why not take his offer and go?
I've made do with less. So have you.
I say we leave now.
you're not going anywhere.
what did you see?
there are spies watching this house and probably every wolf and dog in town.
you must wait until nightfall.
Thorin.
da?
don't let them leave.
you can not hunt 30 orcs on your own.
but I'm not on my own.
you knew I would come?
the king is angry, Tauriel.
for 600 years, my father has protected you, favored you.
you defied his orders.
you betrayed his trust.
the king has never let Orcs fill from outlands.
but he would let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.
it is not our fight. -It is our fight.
it will not end here. With every victory this evil will grow.
if your father has his way, we would do nothing.
we will hide within our walls, live our lives away from light.
and let the darkness descend.
are we not a part of this world?
tell me melon, when did we let evil become stronger than us?
Hello, Bard. What you after?
there was a tapestry, an old one. Where has it gone?
what tapestry are you talking about?
this one.
they were Dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.
Full-beards, pierced eyes. I've never seen the like.
what are Dwarves doing in these parts?
it's the prophecy.
prophecy? -Prophecy of Durin's folk.
prophecy?
prophecy.
the old tales may come true.
vast hordes of treasure?
can it really be true?
has the Lord of the silver fountains returned?
the lord of the silver fountains. The king of carven stone.
the King Beneath the Mountain.
shall come into his own.
and the bell shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.
but all shall fail in sadness, and the lake will shine and burn.
da, I tried to stopped them... -How long have they been gone?
as soon we have the weapons we make straight for the Mountain.
go, go, go.
you all right?
I can manage.
let's just get out of here.
run!
what is the meaning of this?
we caught them stealing weapon, sire.
enemies of the state, em?
a disgrace bunch of mercenaries, if ever there were, Sire.
hold your tongue!
you do not know to whom you speak.
this is no common criminal! This is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror!
we are the Dwarves of Erebor.
we have come to reclaim our homeland.
I remember this town in the great days of old.
fleets of boats laid at the harbor, filled with silks and fine gems.
this was no forsaken town on a lake.
this was the center of all trade of the North.
I would see those days return,
I would relive the great forges of Dwarves, send wealth and riches flowing once more from the hordes of Erebor!
death, that is what you will bring upon us.
dragon fire and ruin.
if you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.
you can listen to this nay-sayer, but I promise you this:
if we succeed, all will share in the wealth of the Mountain.
you will have enough gold, to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over.
all of you, listen to me! You must listen!
have you forgotten what happened in Dale?
have you forgotten of those who died in firestorm?
and for what purpose?
the blind ambition of a Mountain King.
so riven by greed, he can not see beyond his own desire!
no, no. We must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame.
let us not forget, that it was Girion,
lord of Dale, your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast.
it's true, sire. We all know the story.
arrow after arrow he shot, each one missing its mark.
you have no right, no right to enter that mountain.
I have the only right.
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake.
will you see the prophecy fulfilled?
will you...share in the great wealth of our people?
what say you?
I say unto you, welcome!
welcome and rise! Welcome, King under the mountain!
you do know we have one short?
Where's Bifur? -He's not here, we leave him behind.
you'll have to, if you were to find the door before nightfall.
we can risk no more delays.
not you.
we must travel with speed. You'll slow us down.
what are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
no.
uncle, I must be there when that door is open.
when we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...
Kili, stay here, rest, join us when you're healed.
I'll stay with the lad my duty lies with the wounded.
uncle.
we grew up with the tales of the Mountain, tales you told us.
you can't take that away from him.
Kili. - I will carry him if I must!
one day you will be king and you will understand.
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one Dwarf.
not even my own kin.
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.
I belong with my brother.
by my beard, is that the time!
good fortune to all!
move.
no.
did you miss the boarders as well?
Kili, Kili!
no. I'm done with Dwarves, go away.
no, no, no. No one will help us.
Kili's sick.
he's very sick.
what is this place?
for once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin.
the desolation of Smaug.
the sun will soon reach midday.
we must find the hidden door into the Mountain before it sets.
this way. -Wait.
is this the overlook?
Gandalf said to meet him here on no account of what you hear or...
do you see him? We have no time to wait upon a wizard.
we're on our own.
come.
dol Guldur, the hill of sorcerer.
it looks completely abandoned.
as it is meant to.
a spell of concealment lies over this place.
which means our enemies are not yet ready to reveal himself.
he has not regained his full strength.
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel.
tell her, we must force his hand.
what do you mean?
I'm going in alone. On no account come after me.
do I have your word? -Yes, yes, yes.
wait, Gandalf.
what if it's a trap?
turn around and do not come back.
it's undoubtly a trap.
ce no ulco sis nurtaina...
I ettuluvas caninye!
anything? -Nothing!
if the map is true, the hidden door is hidden right above us.
up here!
you have keen eyes, Master Baggins.
this must be it.
the hidden door.
that all those who doubted us, rue this day!
aye, we have a key.
this means that somewhere, there is a keyhole.
the last light of Durin's Day...
will shine upon the keyhole.
we're losing the light, come on.
be quiet! We can't hear when you're thumping!
can't find it.
it's not here!
here!
wreck it down!
come on.
it has to break.
it's no good, the door is sealed.
can't be opened by force.
there is powerful magic on it.
no.
the last light of Durin's Day...
will shine upon the keyhole.
that what it says.
what did we miss?
what did we miss?
Balin. -We've lost the light.
there's no more to be done.
we have but one chance.
come over here, lads. It's over.
wait a minute, what...
where are they going?
you can't give up now.
fine.
you can't give up now.
last light, the grey stone.
when the thrush nods.
the setting sun.
and the last light of Durin's Day will shine...
the last light.
last light.
and the last light...
the keyhole! Come back!
come back! It's the moon! The last moon of autumn!
Where's the key, where's the key? Where's the...
it was...here. It was here.
it was just...
Erebor.
Thorin.
I know these walls.
these walls...
the stone...
you remember, Balin?
chambers filled with golden light.
I remember.
herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.
may the Heart of the Mountain unite all Dwarves in defense of this home.
the throne of the king.
and what's that above it?
the Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
and what's that? -That, master burglar...
is why you are here.
can you not do something? -I need herbs.
something to bring down this fever.
I have nightshade, fever fuel.
they're no use to me. Do you have any king's foil?
no, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.
pigs? Weed, right.
don't move.
do you want me to find the jewel?
a large white jewel, yes.
that's it? Only I imagine there's quite a few down there.
there is only one Arkenstone.
you'll know it when you see it.
right.
in truth, lad. I do not know what you'll find down there.
you needn't go if you don't want to.
there's no dishonor in turning back. -No, Balin.
I promised I would do this.
and I think I must try.
you never ceases to amaze me.
what's that? -The courage of Hobbits.
go now, with as much luck as you can muster.
Oh...Bilbo?
if there's in fact a, um...
a live dragon down here?
don't wake it.
ce no ulco sis nurtaina...
I ettuluvas caninye! Conin i so tanuvaxe!
where is your master?
where is he?
Sauron!
Hello?
you're not at home. Not at home.
what if...good, good, good.
what's that?
Arkenstone, Arkenstone.
a large white jewel.
very helpful.
well, thief.
I smell you.
I hear your breath.
I feel your air.
where are you?
where are you?
come now, don't be shy.
stand into the light.
there is something about you.
something you carry.
something made of gold.
but far more precious.
there you are, a thief in the shadows.
I did not come to steal from you.
o Smaug, the unassessably wealthy.
I merely want to get eyes upon your magnificence.
to see if you really were as great as the old tales say.
I did not believe them!
and do you now?
truly.
the tales and songs...
fall utterly short, of your enormity, O Smaug the stupendous!
do you think flattery will keep you alive?
no, no...
no indeed.
you seem familiar with my name.
but I don't remember smelling your kind before.
who are you? And where do you come from...
may I ask?
I...
I came from under the hill.
under hill?
and under hills and over hills, my path is lead.
and, and through the air. I am here that He walks unseen.
impressive, what else do you claim to be?
I am...Luck-wearer...
Riddle-maker. -Lovely titles, go on.
Barrel-rider. -Barrels.
now that is interesting.
and what about your little Dwarf friends?
where are they hiding?
D...dwarves? No...
no, no Dwarves here. You got that all wrong.
I don't think so.
Barrel-rider, they sent you in here to do their dirty work, while they skulk about outside.
truly. You are mistaken...
o Smaug, chiefest and greatest of all calamities.
you have nice manners for a thief and a liar.
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
no one better.
it is the gold.
they are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.
did you think I did not know this day would come?
that a pack of canting dogs will come crawling back to the Mountain.
was that an earthquake? -That, my lad...
was a dragon.
da? -It's come from the mountain.
you should leave us. Take your children, get out of here.
and go where? There is nowhere to go.
are we going to die, da? -No, darling.
the dragon is going to kill us.
not if I kill it first.
the King Under the Mountain is dead. I took his throne.
I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.
I kill where I wish, when I wish.
my armor is iron!
no blade can pierce me!
all right. -A black arrow. Why did you never tell me?
because you did not need to know.
listen to me carefully. I need you to distract the guards.
once I'm at the top of the tower, I will set the arrow to the bow.
there he is. -Guards, after him!
quickly, down there! Go!
stop him!
bain, Bain.
keep it safe, don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them. Now go! -I'm not leaving.
Ragar. -You're under arrest.
on what charge? -Any charge the Master chooses.
what about Bilbo? -Give him more time.
time to do what? To be killed?
you're afraid. -Yes, I'm afraid.
I fear for you, the sickness the lies upon that treasure, a sickness which drove your grandfather mad.
I'm not my grandfather.
you're not yourself.
the Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.
Bilbo, his name is Bilbo.
it's Oakenshield, that filthy Dwarvish usurper!
he sent you here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?
no, no, no...
I don't know what you're talking about.
don't bother denying it,
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.
but it matters not.
Oakenshield's quest will fail.
a darkness is coming.
it was spread to every corner of the land.
you are being used, thief in the shadows.
you are only ever a means to an end.
the coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life, and found it worth nothing.
no.
no, you're lying.
what did he promise you, a share of the treasure?
as if it was his to give.
I will not part with a single coin!
not one piece of it.
my teeth are swords, my claws are spears.
my wings, are a hurricane.
so it is true.
the black arrow found its mark. -What did you say?
nothing. I was just saying your reputation proceeds you,
o Smaug the Tyrannical.
truly, you have no equal on this earth.
I'm almost tempted to let you take it.
if only to see Oakenshield suffer.
watch it destroy him.
watch it corrupt his arms, and drive him mad.
but I think not, I think our little game ends here.
so tell me, thief.
how do you choose to die?
da? Is that you, Da?
you killed them all.
there are others, Tauriel.
come.
we're losing him.
Tauriel.
Athelas.
Athelas.
what are you doing?
I'm going to save him.
you're alive. -Not for much longer.
did you find the Arkenstone? -The dragon's coming.
the Arkenstone.
did you find it?
we should get out.
Thorin.
Thorin.
you will burn!
come on! -Come on, Bilbo!
come on.
hold him down.
Tilda!
we have given him the slip.
no, he'll still come in for that.
so where to now? -Western guard room.
there may be a way out. -It's too high.
no chance that way. -It's our only chance.
we have to try it.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
I've heard tales of wonders of Elvish medicine.
that was a privilege to witness.
Tauriel.
lie still.
you cannot be her.
she's far away.
she is far, far away from me.
she walks in starlight in another world.
it was just a dream.
do you think she could have loved me?
stay close.
that's it, then. -There's no way out.
the last of our kin.
they must have come here, hoping beyond hope.
we can try to reach the mines.
my last few days.
no.
I will not die like this.
Cowering, clawing for breath.
we make for the forges. -He'll see us, sure as death.
not if we split up.
Thorin, we'll never make it.
some of us might, lead him to the forges.
we kill the dragon.
if this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.
this way.
flee, flee, run for your lives.
there is nowhere to hide.
behind you!
come on!
run!
hey you! Here!
this way, it's this way!
come on! -Thorin!
follow Balin.
Thorin! -Come on!
Thorin!
hold on!
come on!
go, go!
our plan's not gonna work. These furnaces are stone-cold.
he's right.
with no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.
have we not?
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!
you're growing slow, and fat, you dotage, slug!
take cover!
Bombur, get those bellows working!
go!
Bilbo! Up there! On my mark, pull that lever.
Balin, can you still make us a blast flame?
aye, it'll only take a jiffy. Come on.
we don't have a jiffy.
Where's the sulphur? -You sure you know what are you doing?
come on!
now!
lead him to the gallery of the kings.
keep going, Bilbo!
you, think you can deceive me?
Barrel-rider.
you have come from Lake-town.
it is some sort of schemes hatched between these filthy Dwarves and those miserable tub-trading lakeman.
the sniveling cowards, with their long bows and black arrows.
perhaps it is time I pay them a visit. -No.
this isn't their fault. Wait, you cannot go to Lake-town!
you care about them, do you?
good.
and you can watch them die.
here! You witless worm!
you. -I am taking back what you stole.
you will take nothing from me, Dwarf.
I laid low your warriors of old, eye in still terror in the hearts of men.
I am King Under the Mountain.
this is not your kingdom, these are Dwarf lands.
this is Dwarf gold.
and we will have our revenge.
I will revenge, revenge!
I will show you revenge!
listen to me, you don't know what is coming?
I am fire.
I am...
death.
what have we done?
Hello, mother. - Why did you come back?
after all these years, why now? - So, you're Maxine's daughter...
I've been talking to the same three people for, like, 10 years.
so it's really nice to- - Talk to someone new, I get it.
but sometimes I wish my life was simpler.
I want you to come home, Ab. I want us to be okay again.
what happened is done.
it will be just something else; another conspiracy.
boss, your old man died in prison because of this guy.
I told you, when I was ready, we'd deal with Mitch McDeere.
it's time. - I'm sorry guys, we're closed.
Mitch McDeere, I've thinking about this moment since I was 15 years old.
you know why I'm here? - Go on, you son of a bitch.
get it over with. - I don't wanna kill you.
I wanna hire you.
when I was 15 years old I made a promise to find you.
and I'm a man who takes his promises very seriously.
I know Abby and Claire are in Kentucky.
I know Tammy is working on her divorce in Tennessee.
what do you want?
I told you. I want to hire you.
a friend of mine has been charged with murder here in D. C.
his name is Patrick Walker. I want you to represent him.
you're not serious.
you let me know what it is about my tone that suggests I'm not serious.
he's a good friend.
he's been framed for a crime he didn't commit, and I want him out.
I don't handle racket cases. Organized crime is specialized.
you need a lawyer - - I know what I need!
he's not part of my family. He's an economist.
went to school at MIT.
works for a big think-tank here in town;
spends his days thinking about job creation and trade deficits.
who did he kill? - Nobody.
a woman, allegedly; not that she's nobody, but like I said, he was framed.
Joey, I'm just a guy. I never even knew your father.
I'd joined a firm in Memphis and everything went wrong.
I never testified - - You helped the Feds!
you took down the law firm, which took down my father.
you cannot blame me for...
I'm sorry, I didn't realize we were having a debate.
whose turn is it, yours or mine?
here's my offer. You are gonna handle the case.
that's what you're gonna do for me.
if you do, the McDeere and Morolto families will be square.
that's what I'm gonna do for you.
why me? - Because this is what you do best:
uncover the truth.
in Memphis... now with Nobel Insurance, you see what other lawyers don't.
and, uh...
most lawyers just want to win.
you need to win.
a good boss knows how to incentivise his employees.
and if I say no? - You've two choices, Mitch.
you can do this for me, or you can wait until we leave, call Louis Coleman and you can run.
maybe I won't find you. But I promise you this...
I won't stop looking.
I'll be back in the morning.
if you're here, I'll know I have a lawyer.
if you're not, I'll know I don't.
I can't believe he just walked into the office. - They have been watching us for months.
so why not do something sooner? Why now? - The case.
he's keeping us alive so we can get his friend released.
and What stops him from killing us after? - Nothing. His promise.
we can run. Not with the Feds, on our own.
we've always had a backup plan. - Which would work if we were all together.
we need to make a decision right now.
do we call Louis? - Or what, work for the Mob?
are you really considering this? - Yeah, of course I'm considering this, Ray.
it's because the alternative is to call my wife, who has just been through a living hell, and tell her that we are running again.
so instead, you're gonna tell her you're working for Joey Morolto?
look, if we can get Morolto out of our lives then maybe she will come back and we will be okay.
but even if you do this, we are nowhere near okay.
let's just talk to the client; one meeting.
Morolto said that he is not Mob; that he is an economist. - I don't like it.
if something goes wrong we get the hell out of here.
okay, fine. Do it.
call Louis.
one meeting.
unfortunately, I do still have to charge you for our sessions.
Really?
I know you were hoping for that awkward interlude on the balcony with your therapist discount, but...
well, it only seems fair.
is that what you are now, my therapist?
you know, I might take it personally if you hire someone else.
I'm just saying,
I-I don't know how the board of ethics would feel about you kissing a patient.
I mean, that was you wasn't it? You know, it was pretty dark out there.
no, no, that was me. - So...?
so... So I think you need to schedule an appointment right away.
how's tomorrow at two?
two's good.
Hey, um that's my other line.
I gotta go. - Yeah, yeah, go.
see you then.
Hey! - Hey.
glad I caught you. - Yeah, you caught me.
hey so, my dad's taking Claire to work with him at the bank today.
and my mom invited me to lunch.
so, how's it going?
it's... It's not so good, - but we'll see how it goes today. - I miss you.
I know I'm supposed to be giving you space, but I just wanted to...
I just wanted to call and say it. - I miss you too.
look, a client just walked in the office. Can I call you back?
Yeah. - Tammy, I gotta run.
I'll call you back. - May I?
you know, I never liked these but I've heard Reagan ate 'em.
he did all right for himself, huh?
you're here - Guess that means you're in. - Not exactly.
we want a meeting with the client. - I can save you the trip.
he's innocent.
how do you know that? - He told me.
you'll find most people don't lie to me. - You know what I think?
I think if you wanted to kill us you would have done it by now, but you didn't.
you waited, you know why? Because this case
this guy, he matters to you.
you don't want us to take this case, you need us to take this case.
I need a meeting.
Antonio? - Yeah, boss?
get the car. -Get the car.
this is him?
Mitch McDeere, Patrick Walker.
something wrong? - I'm thinking.
are you thinking if something's wrong?
I'm thinking three button suit, which means you will follow trends.
I'm thinking do I want a lawyer who follows trends?
Patrick... - I'm thinking charcoal grey feels safe and predictable.
do I want a lawyer who's safe and predictable? - Hey! Dial it back.
here's what I'm thinking - one and two button suits are worn by prosecutors.
double-breasted, by Mob lawyers, which I invite you to hire.
fair enough.
I'm thinking trials are about persuasion, which means about juries.
juries want comfort, not excitement.
they want to trust the guy who's asking them to put an alleged killer back out on the street.
I'm thinking, do I want a client who is sure that he is the smartest guy in the room when I have been here for 30 seconds and I know that he is clearly not?
I like him. - Told you.
sorry. You know the charge?
I know it's a murder charge. I don't know anything about the victim.
Yeah, well neither do I. Her name is Charlotte Miller and that's all they told me.
you must know something. - I know where I went out for drinks after work.
roma, one of my family clubs here in town. - It's a restaurant/bar, very upscale.
you never saw the victim? - I don't even know who she is.
I went home, took off my suit and went out again.
there was a poker game at a place called The Palace.
I was in my car and all of a sudden there were these lights behind me, pulling me over.
were you drunk? - I didn't think so. I was fine.
but this cop wants to give me a breathalyser.
I blew a . 08. - That's legally impaired.
barely. - They arrested me and then impounded the car.
and I guess they found a...suitcase in the trunk.
cops said she was stuffed inside. Undressed and strangled.
the victim's body was found in the trunk of your car?
he didn't kill her - like I said, he was framed.
I know how this looks, but I'm telling you.
man to man.
I have never met Charlotte Miller.
time's up, Mitch.
are you in or out?
you took the case? - I said we're in.
"we're out" really didn't seem workable in the moment.
so, you think this Patrick was framed? - Unlikely.
a killer puts a strange woman in an innocent economist's trunk?
I said "unlikely."
but you gotta admit, it is possible.
a body in a suitcase is easily portable.
they'd slip it in his trunk when he's at the bar, or when he's back at his apartment.
so, we're doing this? We're trying to figure this out?
the first sign of trouble, we back out and we run.
we're already at the 15th sign of trouble. - You can't have it both ways, Ray.
you can't do this and give me crap for doing it.
okay, what do you want me to do?
Patrick said that he was on his way to a poker game when he got pulled over.
verify if the poker game was happening that night. - And what are you doing?
I'm gonna go to the U. S. Attorney's office, see if the Prosecutor has a theory.
and if so, we need to know what it is.
you drew this case?
don't worry, this one doesn't involve national security.
I'll tell you what I know, but you won't want to hear it. - My client didn't even know the victim.
you believe him?
well, it's my job to believe him until you prove otherwise.
your job? Since when do you rep Walker?
I thought I was dealing with Barry Vance on this one. - Vance is out; I'm in.
fine by me. Vance is a mob lawyer mouthpiece.
Really? - Your boy's connected.
word is Walker is tight with Joey Morolto of Chicago.
Nah, they're old friends. He's not even Mob. Not even Italian.
look, I gotta turn this footage over to you anyways, so you might as well see it while you're here.
that's Walker's building; freight elevator at the end of the third floor hall.
you'll note it's 2: 04, about 12 minutes before your boy gets pulled over.
that's the suitcase with Charlotte Miller inside.
there's a camera in the lobby elevator. That's why he's using the freight.
but he didn't know they put one in here a few months ago.
how do you know the suitcase isn't empty?
wheels get caught; he uses both hands to pull the bag on.
you know why? It weighs 117 pounds.
circumstantial. - Like hell.
Charlotte Miller is in that bag. We also found her clothes.
her clothes were in his building?
they were bundled up with your client's sheets and thrown down the trash chute.
not smart.
he must have been moving pretty quickly, which is why I don't think he meant to kill her.
manslaughter? - Rough sex gone wrong...
they met at Roma, went back to his place; things got a little hot and heavy...
you want my theory, there you have it.
I thought we were having lunch. - We are.
now, before you look at these, I want a quick opinion, not a big to-do.
your father mentioned that you balanced the books for your little firm at home.
patronizing, condescending and vaguely sexist, but I am going to choose not to see it that way.
I'm gonna choose to see it as you asking me for help.
you know I'm not very good with money.
well, you were always better at spending it than you were with accounting for it.
rude, obnoxious, vaguely sexist...
okay, what's the problem? - The budget for the community centre.
we get significant funding from the state every year, but if you look at what we spend on the children it doesn't add up.
Dr. Wilson mentioned that.
Really? During one of your sessions?
is that you have an accountant? - Yes we do.
his name is Charles Finley.
he took over for Martin Gorham when he passed last year.
nice man... - But?
but Martin had a ledger. He kept everything by hand.
since Charles has come on board, we can't seem to find it.
that's convenient. - And suspicious, I agree.
we can't compare the new numbers with the old ones without that ledger.
Charles says he simply misplaced it, but it does make me wonder.
nice place. - Yeah, what brings you in?
um, Mitch is gonna come down and have a talk with Joey.
maybe not the best time; things are pretty tense.
can I get you something, sir? - Nah, I'm good thanks.
they tell me you were inside, Brushy Mountain. Yeah, I did a 15 year bid.
did a nickel myself at Joliet.
so this... Patrick... why is the boss so invested?
what, You guys gonna get him out? - I don't know.
he already lied about the poker game, so that's not a good way to start.
Yeah, you guys need to do somethin'. Boss likes Patrick.
he trusts him. - Yeah, why?
the kid's crazy smart. Helps Joey with all the business stuff.
right now, he's the guy Joey trusts the most.
Patrick lied. I just talked to the Prosecutor.
everything Patrick told us was a lie.
you wanna sit?
her clothes were in his building.
they found them wrapped up in his sheets and thrown down the incinerator chute.
damn... - You knew?
Patrick told me the clothes were gone. Burned.
they have him on video getting on the elevator 12 minutes before the cops picked him up.
with the suitcase. - No, there weren't any cameras.
they were installed two months ago.
now look, I don't know what your angle is, Joey, but I will give you my professional opinion.
Patrick is going to prison. - That doesn't work for me.
the Prosecutor thinks it's manslaughter.
I say we run with that offer and plead it out.
okay, he lied. We lied.
but the case is the same; he was framed. - You don't believe that...
when he got back to his apartment the girl was there.
he found her in his bed. What was he supposed to do?
she was dead. Strangled, half naked...
it was a set-up. - Why didn't he call you? Ask for help?
I don't know. He was drinking.
if he had, we wouldn't be here right now. - I'm out. I want out of this.
you're not out; you got a wife and kid, remember?
to hell with this, we're getting played. - Yeah, I'm starting to get that impression.
this Patrick guy is a real piece of work; stone-cold liar.
he's a lot more than that, brother. I think he's Joey's closest advisor.
meaning what? - Meaning our new client is not just an economist.
he's Joey's new consigliere.
we spent all that time and money protecting you and your family from the Chicago Mob
I was gonna tell you. - I got shot helping Abby with the Noble case.
I broke you and Ray out of jail.
I risked my career and Joey Morolto waltzes through your front door and I have to read about it in a surveillance report?
are you still watching me? - No, not you, him.
the FBI tracked him from Chicago to D. C.
but they didn't know to warn you because you left the program.
hey look, it's not like I asked to see him. He found me.
and offered you a job.
and your brains are so scrambled after Noble Insurance you said yes.
how did you know that? - I'm a Federal Agent, Mitch.
you signed the visiting log at a prison. And yes, let me tell you something.
we know about Patrick Walker. - Then you know that I didn't have a choice.
Joey made me an offer: I either take the case and we're square, or run.
and you believe him?
you think you do this one thing for him. he's just gonna forget that you put his father in prison?
I was trying to protect my family. - I should just let you do this.
I should just walk away.
didn't all this start because you didn't want to be a Mob lawyer?
Louis, what do you want me to say? - Let's go.
where? - The FBI.
you wanna work for Joey Morolto, you need to see what you're getting into.
this is your client. He's one of Joey Morolto's top lieutenants.
Mitch, it's the wrong time to get involved with the Moroltos.
there's a major rift in the family.
over what? - Over the future.
Joey is the next generation of the mob.
he understands that the Golden Age is over.
he wants to move the family connections to move into legitimate businesses.
and so, what's the problem? - You're looking at 'em here.
these guys, they don't care about legitimate businesses.
they run vice operations, loan sharking, gambling, hijacking;
they're not too happy about being pushed aside.
they don't like the boss listening to Patrick Walker.
exactly, Joey's already got a consigliere, Antonio Cervino.
how do you think he feels about the new kid in town?
your client.
madge, it's Charley Findley. I found those invoices you wanted.
okay, Charles, I'm betting you still have that ledger.
a rift? - It makes sense; Joey's headed in a new direction.
this guy, what's his name? - Antonio... something.
Antonio. He's upset about being replaced, so he figures out a way to eliminate the competition.
so you think Antonio framed Patrick, but a couple of hours ago you were convinced that Patrick was guilty.
it's possible. It is possible, right?
Oh, yeah right. - I don't care about the truth.
we argue it, it gets us reasonable doubt; gets us off the hook with Joey.
what? - Nothing, just... you are not caring about the truth.
we've come a long way.
look, if we're gonna do this you need to talk to Joey.
Antonio's still his top lieutenant. Gonna have to clear it with him first.
what are you doing? - I'm Maxine Sutherland's daughter.
this is a private office. That's my private property.
this is not your... - You had no right to come in here.
I'm taking this. - You will do no such thing.
Ben, Dr. Wilson!
Abby, what's going on? Are you all right? - Ben, the ledger...
Charles has it; it's in his desk. - What ledger?
the one that he claims is missing. - This woman broke into my office.
it's right there under his desktop. - Abby...
it's right there. He's stealing. Money's missing, you said so yourself.
Charles, I'm sorry. - What?
this woman's a patient and I've been counselling her.
she had no right breaking into your office. - You'd better get her out of here.
now.
what was that? I was about to ask you the same thing.
you did nothing. All you had to do was open his desk.
exactly, Abby, his desk. You can't just break into somebody's office.
okay, let's get one things straight.
you and I have had some conversations but you are not counselling me, and I am not your patient.
you know, after that maybe you should be.
my father was 43 when they made him boss.
me? I'm a legacy.
I inherited this family.
that's why people underestimate me.
some even question my view of the future.
listen Morolto, we don't underestimate you and we mean you no disrespect.
but it is pretty clear that you are listening to the advice of Patrick Walker rather than your consigliere.
no. - You trust Patrick, it makes sense that Antonio would feel threatened.
I said no.
my consigliere has been with this family for 40 years.
he's served my father with love. It doesn't have to be the truth.
we can take that argument to the jury. It can get us reasonable doubt.
you're asking for permission to accuse my top lieutenant of framing Patrick?
Yes.
I can't do that.
find another way to win.
you and I need to talk.
if it were up to me, you'd be dead.
killed you myself months ago when we found you.
Joey Sr. was more than my boss.
I would have taken a bullet for him.
the fact that you're breathing, and he's not...
it offends me.
I assume you know this.
I was overruled by his son, so that was that.
loyalty, respect, discipline
what goes on between me and my boss is between me and my boss.
so, the next time you question my loyalty...
you remember something.
my loyalty's the only reason you're alive.
Hello?
sorry to interrupt. I thought I might find you here.
um, no problem, we were just finishing up.
this is the Assistant U. S. Attorney, Allan Harper.
this is Antonio - I'm sorry, I-I don't...
know your full name.
nice company you're keeping.
hm, what have you got there?
well, speaking of people who'd prefer to remain anonymous, we've got some new discovery on the Walker case.
it turns out what we gave you wasn't complete.
apparently your client's car wasn't stopped solely because of his erratic driving.
which he denies.
the officer was responding to an anonymous tip relayed through the 911 operator.
a tip?
reporting that your client was drunk and where his car would be.
my client says he was framed. Now, hang on.
the tip supports his defence. The caller could have been a set-up.
that call could have come from anyone.
passing motorists who saw him weaving. - Which I am moving to suppress.
then you'll lose. The search was good, Mitch.
no judge is gonna toss a body in that trunk.
right, so that's why you came here, to see my reaction?
because you're not nervous...
Hey. Thank you for coming.
you walked away pretty angry today. Could you blame me?
I'm sorry. I was caught a little off guard.
you sold me out, Ben. You sold out the kids who need treatment.
why, because I wouldn't break into a colleague's desk?
because he's stealing, Ben, and we had the evidence.
