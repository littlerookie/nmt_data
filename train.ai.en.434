infrastructure investment could increase global demand today while building productivity for tomorrow.
infrastructure investment is a long - term investment.
infrastructure investment is focused on the under-developed western and central regions, helping to drive a process of industrialization and urbanization that should lift incomes by absorbing excess rural labor, and spur housing investment (and associated consumer spending) in fast-growing interior cities.
infrastructure investment is much needed.
infrastructure investment was the best way to boost domestic demand quickly, but in the longer term the government needs to lift consumer spending by shifting income from firms to households and by improving welfare support and health care.
infrastructure investments can fill the void, creating much-needed jobs in the construction sector, which has been particularly hard hit, and generating demand for industrial products.
infrastructure investments in developing countries would therefore increase demand for manufactured goods in advanced economies.
infrastructure is a great place to start because it has a common-sense relationship to productivity.
infrastructure is a prerequisite of e-government, which ensures that e-government can keep long-term, stable and orderly development.
infrastructure is being restored, but ms bachelet's government has been less than sure-footed.
