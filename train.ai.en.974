bad for your skin.
Yeah, but good for our soul.
where are we staying tonight?
some motel chain down by the airport.
the paperwork is in the car.
the room is confirmed.
room?
well, you know, with the government cutbacks and everything...
I'm kidding, kidding.
rooms, plural.
just checking.
his name's Roger Davis.
I'm sorry, he doesn't look familiar.
why would my brother be talking to a police detective?
I don't know.
when did you say he came back to L. A?
last night.
I've never seen that guy.
or that one.
what do they have to do with my son?
well, we found Rob's driver's license in a crack den.
we know he used to have a drug problem.
do you think he might be using again?
I really don't anything about what he's up to.
Robby's been clean since he left town.
you're sure?
no. I guess not.
when was the last time that you saw him?
couple of months ago.
we had coffee at the Santa Monica Airport.
he was in town buying some jets for his company.
he seemed perfectly fine.
how long since you've seen him?
it's been years.
and why is that?
we don't get along.
never did, really.
I think he bristled is the nice way to say it, at my parenting style.
so you were a hard-ass.
when my son was younger, he was a screw-up.
I felt like I had to put my foot down.
when Rob comes to town, he calls, but he doesn't come over.
and that's because of the relationship with your father.
Yeah.
when was the last time he actually called you?
last week.
he asked about some boxes of his we had in the attic, but I'd thrown them out.
do you know what he was looking for?
no. They were from his old room, so I just figured he'd gotten sentimental.
do you think it has anything to do with why he came back to L. A?
it's possible.
can you think of any reason why he might come to Los Angeles?
no.
um, you can call me if you think of anything, if you have any questions.
Rob's a good man.
I'm sure he is.
okay, thanks.
one of the L. A. suspects claims that he found Rob's bag in the street.
just lying there?
that's what he says. Who knows?
anyway, LAPD is going to focus their canvass in that area.
all right, well, that cop Rob was hunting down is being taken to Interview 1.
maybe he'll tell us the truth.
I love it when you get optimistic.
did you know Mr. Simms from when you lived in L. A?
no.
I'd never seen the guy until a few days ago.
then why did he contact you?
double homicide.
happened back in '92,'93.
couple.
both stabbed to death in their own home.
names were Bill and Emily Jackson.
they lived out in the Hancock Park area of L. A.
their daughter found them.
I thought he was one of those junior detective types, the kind that are obsessed with unsolved cases.
but there was a little more to it.
so... you never had any good suspects?
the papers had it right.
we had a few in the beginning, but we never got any real traction.
the murders were 15 years ago.
why the interest now?
I, uh... I used to live in L. A.
ani think might have seen something
What'd you see?
I'm not sure tell mefigure out iit's relevant
I'm t ready do that y I want tmake that I'm right.
how are you gog too at
I kept a notebook.
just want to get it and make sure that I'm remembering everything correct.
look...
here's the name of a detective still working for the LAPD.
he was a patrolman working on the case.
call him whenever you're ready.
I will.
why didn't you come forward 15 years ago?
wanted to pretend it never happen.
but something recently stirred up some memories.
whoever did that to those people, it wasn't right.
I know.
I checked with my friend on the force.
he never called.
so your suspects, um, not enough proof, or just threads that didn't pan out?
the latter.
whoever did it was invisible, at least as far as we were concerned.
did he ever call you again?
that was it.
I'll tell you, he had his facts down about the case.
he had done his homework.
I'm just saying that if we had GPS, we would have gotten here 20 minutes ago.
what, men don't ask directions?
that is a clich\ that is beneath you.
you got lost.
if you say so.
you got lost.
special Agent Malone, FBI.
this is Special Agent Spade.
this is Gil.
he saw your guy.
Hi, Gil.
I didn't do anything.
why don't you tell me something that makes me believe that, Gil.
I was collecting empties.
get in the car.
just get in the car.
I know what this is about.
I'm not doing this...
turn around.
now get in the car.
all right, all right, all right.
he left the backpack there.
I just toothe cash.
I mean, if I didn't grab it, someone else would have.
that's true.
thanks for your time, Gil.
excuse us.
I have a feeling whoever took Rob, it wasn'the L. A.welcome wagon.
well, somebody didn't want him poking around in that murder.
all right. Thanks, Detective.
Davis didn't recognize the sketch of the guy who pulled Rob off the street.
I'm not surprised, considering LAPD had no real suspects for the murder.
but I'm not buying that this guy's not connected to the whole thing.
but what's motivating this guy to come forward after 15 years?
guilt over the dead mechanic?
Oh, come on.
I know it's very Psych 101, but it's the best I got.
okay, LAPD faxed over the case summary and police reports from the Jackson murders.
who found them?
the daughter.
she came back from a sleepover and the back door was open.
now, a ten-inch knife was missing. from the Jackson's kitchen set, which is consistent withheir wounds.
the police labeled it a robbery gone wrong.
the killer tried to clean up his path in and out of the house, so he was concerned about getting caught.
he certainly didn't want to leave any witnesses.
the wife has knife wounds to her back.
the killer definitely chased her down.
they get any good forensics?
the husband had a piece of torn T-shirt in his hand.
the DNA sample didn't match anyone in the database or any of their acquaintances.
so the question here is: Can we tie Simms or anybody he knows to the dead couple?
that's why I made copies.
Hey, Ma, it's Samantha.
I'm calling to check on Finn, see how he's doing.
um, hope he got into his bath okay.
I just, uh...
you know, why don't you just call me?
okay, bye.
Hey. Hey.
LAPD is releasing a photo of Simms, at all the divisions and substations, along with an alert about the murder.
anybody that knows anything has to call us.
so what? We're just gonna...
wait?
well, we could drive around.
you know, L.A. is 400 square miles.
we'll hit something eventually.
what are we doing here, Jack?
we're, you know, um...
standing here in L. A.waiting for somebody to tell us where to go.
as a metaphor, that's fine; as an answer, it stinks.
then I would go with the metaphor.
you didn't bring me 3, 000 miles to drink bad coffee and wait around.
probably not.
you know how I feel about you, right?
how I've always felt about you?
and the truth is, before I had a baby, it would've been fine for us to come here and have a... a good time.
but our good time always ends up messy and it's too hard to pick up the pieces.
I'm not trying to make it hard.
I need stability, consistency...
I don't even need it.
my child needs it.
don't answer that.
look, two seconds, you can call him back.
let's finish this conv...
Hello?
Jack, the dead couple's daughter lives about a quarter-mile from where Simms was abducted.
what's the address?
that would be 1850 Sixth Street.
her name is Ali Jackson.
okay.
Yes, he was here, but I have no idea where he is now.
I believe that Rob Simms came here to talk to you about your parents.
I don't want to talk about that anymore.
there's been too much talking.
you know, I understand that this is very difficult for you, but we've got to find this guy.
he's got family and friends who are home worried and waiting for him.
anything you can tell us will help.
it's funny...they always stop by, thinking they're doing me a favor.
I don't want to stir things up.
then why are you here?
I might have information that you'd want to know.
every couple of months, some crackpot like you, ads about it on the Internet and shows up.
what's your spin?
aliens did it?
the Zodiac Killer?
I don't have a spin.
then leave me alone.
why won't all of you leave me alone?
I... I just wanted to help.
I'm-I'm sorry. I...
help?
find the guy who murdered my parents and kill him yourself.
save me sitting through a trial.
I went in and called Detective Wells.
when I looked outside again, the guy was gone.
detective Wells?
Yeah. He had called me that morning.
he told me that someone might stop by to talk about my parents, and he asked me to call him if they did.
is that the guy?
I don't know.
we never met.
he just called that one time.
okay. We're going to need the number that you called.
does this...really have something to do with my parents?
the truth is, we don't know yet, but as soon as we do, I promise you, we'll let you know.
so there is no Detective Wells in the LAPD.
but, listen, the number she called belongs to an Ed Wells, and he looks exactly like the sketch we have of the man who took Rob.
he is an ex-con.
he did time for armed robbery, and he's been out on the streets for 17 years.
that doesn't mean he's clean.
it just means he hasn't been caught.
how did Ed Well know that Simms was in L. A?
I mean, did you find any contact between the two of them?
uh, not between them, but I pulled several months of phone records and Wells talks to Rob's father almost every day.
thank you.
ed loves Rob.
I've got witnesses who say otherwise.
they must've seen it wrong.
ed practically raised my brother.
when Robb had his drug troubles, Ed took him in and got him straightened out.
Oh, tough love.
must be something he learned in prison.
ed did his time.
when he got out of prison, my dad gave him money to start a landscaping business.
he's had no trouble ever since.
Where's your father now?
I don't know.
he left not long after you were here.
after Ed called?
Yes.
do you know what they talked about?
your brother is in town, claiming to know something about a 15-year-old murder.
ed Wells took him off the street, we tnk to keep him quiet.
so unless you want Rob to end up dead, you should start telling us what you know.
rob said something...a long time ago.
but he was so screwed up, I just assumed that he was lying.
I am watching it.
it's gross.
let's play a video game or something. - I want to watch it.
Why?
do you know where Dad was the other night?
the other night those people died?
what does it matter?
he just...
he said something strange.
wake up.
what?
leave me alone.
get up.
what is wrong with you?
I want you to listen to me and listen hard.
if anyone asks you where you were last night, you were with me, here.
you got it?
who's gonna ask me about...
just... Just do what I tell you.
now go upstairs.
fine.
I was with you.
it's weird, right?
you don't know what you're talking about.
God, he's acting crazy, and I saw blood, it was on his shirt.
I did.
dad didn't do anything!
but what if he did, shouldn't we let someone know?
what goes through your drugged-up brain that makes you hate us so much.
I don't hate you.
watch whatever you want.
rob was always so angry at Dad.
I just figured he was trying to get back at him for something.
did he ever mention it again?
no.
he went to live with Ed a couple weeks later.
did your father have any connecon with the murdered couple?
not that I know of.
excuse me.
why would he do anything to them?
I don't know.
uh, okay.
we'll be right there.
LAPD just picked up her father and Ed Wells.
rob was not with them.
all right, which one do you want?
murdering father?
or kidnapping best friend?
how about I take whoever's telling the truth.
all right. Rock, paper, scissors.
you know, it takes a pretty special friend to cover up a murder that you committed.
neither one of us would hurt my son.
so what is it about having Rob abducted that makes you innocent exactly?
he came to L. A. to confront you about the Jacksons, correct?
he was at the house this morning.
you killed those people.
no, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
you killed those people and you wanted me to lie about it.
you were screwed up back then, Rob.
we were watching TV the night those folks died.
when did we ever watch TV together?
nothing good can come from dredging up the past. - Yes, it can.
I can finally leave you behind.
you don't know what you' talking about, son.
well, then I'll go find out.
all right, I'll talk to people, and I'll find out what exactly I'm remembering.
just...
for your own sake, don't ask any more questions.
just...
let it go.
I tried.
I've been running from your lie half my life.
but I'm not lying for you or anyone.
not anymore.
and I never saw him after that.
but you had Ed pick him up, right?
Yes.
why is that?
because you murdered the Jackson couple?
they were landscape clients of Ed's.
he talked about how rich they were.
I needed money.
the house was dark.
I didn't think they were home.
things g out of hand.
Oh, you think?
you only stabbed them 15 times.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.
ed, Charlie's already confessed.
listen, I get it, he's your friend.
you wanted to stop Rob from talking.
so when Charlie sent you after him, you did what you had to.
it's not that simple.
nothing ever is.
but I can tell you this for sure.
LAPD has crime scene DNA in the freezer.
they are going to convict him.
so you have a choice: Keep protecting Charlie, or start protecting yourself.
Charlie didn't do anything.
look, I'm sorry about the gun, Rob.
but I need you to listen to me.
you gotta stop asking questions.
I know you feel indebted to him, Ed, because of all he's done for you.
but he killed those people.
what's in the past should stay there.
Yeah, that's what my dad said.
and he's right.
people like their daughter, we need to let them move on.
I don't want to hurt her, but I've got to go to the police.
don't do tha I can't keep quiet any longer.
stop.
look, I'm telling you, he didn't do it.
how can you be sure?!
how can you be sure?!
because you did it.
you killed them.
what?
what do you mean?
you were high on PCP.
you helped me with their landscaping job.
when you came home, covered in blood...
you were talking about the rich people.
your dad knew something...
horrible had happened.
so he cleaned it up.
and when he was sure that you didn't remember a thing, he sent you to live with me.
he knew he hadn't been the father that you deserved.
he just... wanted you to have a chance to turn your life around.
I... I killed them?
I killed them.
you're a good man.
you weren't yourself.
get out.
no, Rob, let's just go home...
just get out!
rob, don't do this.
get out. - Don't do this, Rob.
I called Charlie right away and...
we looked everywhere we could think of, but we couldn't find him.
we're going to need a nationwide APB.
Hey.
lifeguard found this inside a pair of shoes, along with keys to a truck and a money clip with about $200 in it.
suicide note.
truck in the parking lot?
Yeah. It's the one from the APB.
okay, thanks.
looks like he decided to take long swim until he got tired.
for what I have done, there can be no forgiveness.
that's a... That's a hard way to go.
I kind of like Los Angeles.
I don't know what it is.
there's something sort of peaceful about it.
Yeah, it could be the fact that everybody here goes to bed at 8: 30.
Yeah, well, at least it's warm.
it's, like, 40 degrees back in New York.
Hey, cold helps slow down the aging process.
would you like to try some of this?
come here.
ready?
um... I really want this to work.
I would like to be all the things that you need me to be.
but there's a lot of stuff in my life that I need to clear up.
apparently my daughter has been acting up.
she's got a boyfriend her mother hates, and she got caught smoking pot.
so we decided that, uh, Hannah should come and live with me in New York for a while.
change of scenery.
it scares the crap out of me.
every time somebody I care about relies on me, I just shut down.
you can do anything that you set your mind to.
that's the the sunstroke talking.
no. No.
what if I screw it up?
you won't. You can't.
you have to figure it out this time, Jack, because...
your daughter's depending on you.
and for you and your son.
Yeah, there's that.
never even used the bloody thing.
good luck.
Oh, God.
fix bayonets!
fix bayonets!
ready, men?
Halt!
come on!
come on!
kill me!
easy, girl. Easy!
I think we should get rid of her, Mr. Gerald. She's uncontrollable.
nothing is uncontrollable.
it's just a matter of will.
I'll tame her.
how's your father, sir?
I hope you don't mind me asking, but is he any better?
he's alive, Mr. Sutton.
or he was when I left him half an hour ago.
I've no doubt he'll hang on for my sister's wedding.
he's paying for it, after all.
Gudrun. What are you doing?
I have a train to catch.
but the opening? Will be a triumph.
really, Maurice. The exhibits are ready, the gallery looks wonderful.
mightn't we at least go for a drink? The Pompadour's... I don't go in there, Maurice. You know that.
it's full of frauds.
anyway, I'm expected.
and I mustn't disappoint.
for goodness' sake, Gerald. Sit still.
he does it deliberately. He knows I hate waiting.
he's got a wooden leg. He could hop.
Gerald, it's a night out at the theatre.
it's Hamlet - it's not torture. Well, we'll see about that, won't we?
well, I was bored. That's all.
I wanted to see if the situation was merely geographical.
such a long time, this last one, though.
I think we'd rather given up on you.
what happened, Prune?
nothing happened.
nothing at all. I was becoming an artist and...
and surviving a war. Like everybody else.
well, you're here now.
that's the main thing.
what a moaner.
I was going to wave my handkerchief halfway. Hope they'd take me out and shoot me.
I know you only say it to irritate me. Let's go and have supper - rescue the evening.
just let me say hello.
well, don't expect me to lie on your behalf. I won't pretend I enjoyed it.
relation or otherwise.
Rupert. Hello, Sam!
how good of you to come.
not at all. It was wonderful.
Samantha, this is Gerald Crich.
pleased to meet you, Mr. Crich. And I you.
best I've seen.
Mm!
oysters.
in Nottingham. Apparently it's the most landlocked place in the country.
if Gerald wants something he usually gets it.
how do you two know each other, then? Did you fight together?
hard to say. I tended to keep my eyes shut most of the time.
he won a medal.
we knew each other before the war.
then we took up again after I resigned my commission.
I worked as a nurse at Dover. Did Rupert tell you?
you know, he was incredibly vague about his...theatrical cousin.
especially in certain key areas. SHE GIGGLES.
I don't normally do this.
never kid a kidder.
this is a nice surprise.
I need a change.
I can't walk through town like this.
listen, you couldn't do me a favour, could you?
I left in a bit of a hurry this morning.
I didn't have time to give anything. Money?
what else? RUPERT SCOFFS.
Sam won't want money. She... I think I'd rather close the account all the same.
no. Do your own dirty work.
I'm merely trying to behave like a gentleman, Rupert.
maintain a...
few standards. Christ, Gerald!
where have you been for the past four years?
the old ideas are as dead as nails.
we must find a new way of existing.
Rupert, I want you to drop some money off for me, not open a bloody vein.
what do you live for?
to make things go, to move forwards. Still?!
Oh! And you would have us go backwards, would you?
or sideways, perhaps? I mean, none never knows with you, Rupert.
you've revoked God, you've revoked humanity
should the bunnies be quaking now? I mean, what the bloody hell's left? Love!
the more I think about it, it's...
so blindingly obvious. Love is...
the antithesis of death of negation.
it's the purest positive form.
and it is meant to be the centre and core of our lives.
meaningful union.
with a member of the opposite sex.
as nature intended.
that has to be the be-all and end-all of our existence and anything else...
meaningless...
sating of a body a corrupt body which rots.
Rupert, I slept with the woman I didn't fuck her in the grave!
besides which, when it comes to behaving correctly with a lady, perhaps you should take a little look in the mirror.
you're not exactly blemish-free there yourself, are you?
saddle her up. But Mr. Gerald. She's not ready.
just do it. Yes, sir.
good day.
gerald Crich. And you are?
our schoolteacher's sister.
the artist.
you should really let her back until the train has passed.
she's fine.
you're hurting her. I'm teaching her.
she doesn't like it! I don't care.
hurry up!
you've made her bleed. Miss Brangwen, she is no use to me if she shies and whinnies every time she hears a train. In addition, you must understand that deep down, she wants to be ridden.
that's how horses are.
they have two wills.
with the one, they want to be wild and free.
but with the other, they want to put themselves in the human power completely.
and that is a fact of life.
Oh, aren't you a proud man, Mr. Crich!
aren't you a proud man!
prune, there you are.
hello. Ooh, may I?
I can't settle. I'm out of my rhythm.
I'll walk home with you.
I'm not going. There's a wedding.
father's playing, I...
I thought I'd like to hear how he sounds.
all right! Rupert Birkin will be there. It's a chance to see him. Really?
prune, I've told you - we are friends, nothing more. Of course.
try not to look quite so famished.
there! There's Rupert Birkin in the green.
that's Rupert Birkin?
Oh! I'm sorry, in your letters, you...
I just thought there'd be more of him.
that's Hermione Roddice.
come. There's nothing more to see.
miss Brangwen. I thought it was you.
how do you do? Very well, thank you.
and your sister. How nice to see you again.
er...? We bumped into each other, this morning.
you should have come into the church. There was room at the back.
well, I did not mean to come at all but Ursula wanted to hear our father play.
it was first class. As ever.
Rupert, don't slink off. Miss...
miss Brangwen is here. Really...Nonsense!
he'd be mortified to think he missed you.
Rupert. We did wave.
I was just about to say so.
well, that's a start.
do you know Miss Brangwen's sister?
no, I think you'd moved to London before... You are Gudrun Brangwen?
I have two of your pieces.
hermione Roddice. Oh! How nice.
whenever I see Miss Brangwen, I always remind her what a talented sister she has.
you must bring your genius to see me at Breadalby.
of course, we're hugely proud of what Ursula has achieved, too, at the school.
how do you two know each other?
Oh, We had a row this morning.
but it's all forgotten now.
how is the animal?
Gudrun. What is the matter?
what do you think?
Crich. Behaving as if he owns the very ground upon which I walk.
well, he does, for the most part.
room at the back. In the public pews - how dare he?
father...
I was thinking
do you suppose Winnie might benefit from some extra tuition?
she seems to have a particular talent for drawing.
perhaps we should...
encourage her rather more in that direction.
I think it's...
I think it's an excellent idea, Gerald. Do you have anyone in mind?
I think there may be someone.
leave it to me.
you didn't.
Oh, it's so dark.
I think it's going to rain.
the children don't return until tomorrow.
Yes, I know, I, er...
I'm not here officially.
I...thought I ought to come.
seeing you at the church the other day, I realised I hadn't been in touch for some time and...
I didn't want you to think that I was behaving...improperly with you.
it is you.
Hermione. What are you doing here?
well, I was driving. I saw your car.
miss Brangwen.
twice in as many days.
how delightful. Hermione.
do remind your sister, won't you?
my, er...invitation.
I do so want to discuss her work, Rupert.
it's full of a primitive passion. I think that you would really...
I'm well aware of Miss Branwgen's oeuvre. Thank you.
I will call again when term has started.
though, as I say, everything here seems exemplary.
is it, though, Rupert?
is Miss Brangwen really helping our children?
she teaches them to understand the flower
to know all its functions and its biology
but in so doing, doesn't she condemn them to miss the most important thing of all...
the flower's essential scent?
knowing is everything to you, Hermione.
it is all your life. You must leave Miss Brangwen alone, Rupert.
she will want her tea.
she cannot sit around listening to your theories all day.
please...
don't take any notice of her.
what you do here is wonderful.
Mr. Birkin.
Rupert! Yes?
is there something the matter? Yes.
Yes, there is.
I'm confused, I confess.
you see...
we've known each other for some time now
especially since I broke off my engagement - and...
we have become friends, I think.
you certainly treat me warmly.
more than you might a friend, I suspect, and yet...
that is all we are - friends. Still.
and people have started to comment.
they wonder at our relationship and I defend it...
but what do you want of me, Mr. Birkin?
I don't understand.
Winnie, this is Miss Brangwen.
how do you do? I'll leave you to get to know each other.
so...
how shall we begin? We can draw Bismarck! Bismarck?
he's through there.
Mr. Crich.
I'm here.
see? He looks so splendid.
he's almost as big as a lion.
shall we take him out? He's a fearful kicker.
we'll try, shall we?
come on. There we go...
Ooh... Ow! Ow! You should get one of the men to do that for you.
Bismarck! You're behaving terribly. Oh, you...
I know these beggars of old.
he's not hurt, is he? No.
but he ought to be.
they do scratch so, don't they? Oh, how vile. Mine's nothing...
what a devil.
I love the water.
well, you know we may treat it as our own from now on.
I wonder if dear Gerald holds the rest of his employees in the same regard.
I do think he's quite in awe of me. SHE CHUCKLES.
It's...rather wonderful.
I hope you don't encourage him.
Oh, Ursula, Gerald's a man.
they think it's their right to have you.
you don't need to encourage them.
so tired... Very tired...
just...
concentrate on getting better.
look to the long game.
did you have many men?
what? In London. I...
you seem to have grown up such a lot and...sometimes in your letters...
Ursula! Really.
I'm curious. I'm not...
I have so little experience, you see. Apart from Anton.
that's your own business.
do you think love needs sex?
that is why I ask.
what?
I mean... when you are in love, and there is a physical relationship, I know that sex must burn at the very core of it.
I just wonder whether...
in the way that some can seem to have sex totally outside of love and enjoy it...
can others, perhaps, find love outside of sex?
where does sex fit...
in relation to love, do you think?
sex is power.
it's where we have power, and...
beyond that I don't go. BIRDS SQUAWK AND FLUTTER.
huh! You see? You're a man, you want to do a thing, you do it.
seriously, Gudrun.
the men I've slept with in town, the Bohemian crowd, they're Bohemian because they can afford to be.
they're rich and they're lazy and they're spoilt and...
sex is all they're good for.
love's never really an issue. So I...
don't trouble myself with thoughts of it.
gudrun GASPS Winifred! I'm late for our lesson.
right.
music...
and...
cigarettes.
no more witticisms, please. I shall commit murder.
I think you'd get away with it.
no-one would blame you.
that's good, surely?
Salsie! Sorry, I'm late.
this is my brother, everyone.
just down from The Lords.
have you met my driver?
I did fix it! Mmmm.
allow me.
I'm sorry, is it not clean?
it's fine.
thank you.
forgive me. HE POURS
I didn't expect to see you here. Oh, I do apologise.
it's my artistic bent, you see.
it gets me into the poshest of places.
I'm going for a walk.
will you come with me?
Ursula. Don't speak. Just listen to me, please.
please, don't doubt my feelings for you. Rupert!
I need to see you.
actually, I'm rather busy. It won't wait...I'm afraid.
I really must insist.
are you ready? Yes.
Yes. A walk would be good. WHOOPING
come on.
it's beautiful.
and worth the money?
if you have it, yes. It's a first edition.
well, I've bought it for you.
Hermione, please...
what?
I had hoped that we could remain friends, but I see now...
I know she is my rival.
miss Brrrrangwen.
she is not your rival.
no-one is your rival because there is nothing between us, you and me. SHE LAUGHS
how plain must I be? We are done, Hermione.
and yet here you are.
you asked me to look at a book.
isn't there always...a reason?
I'm leaving.
No!
kiss me.
what?
kiss me. What? Stop it.
stop it! Stop it!
why would you do that, of all things?
we are dead in the ground! Don't...dig the corpse up.
no, you don't.
I don't let you.
Oh, it's so much more magical at night.
let's bathe.
but we haven't any costumes. Oh, Gudrun!
Oh, I do sometimes entertain fantasies of being utterly kept, you know.
having this sort of thing on tap. You'd be bored witless in a week.
that's why the rich all intermarry.
you are too cruel.
it's why you behave as you do with Gerald Crich, isn't it?
the rich can't be universally dismissed.
some of them are just like us.
they bleed, too, Gudrun.
Oh, yes, Gerald Crich has suffered much!
he lost his brother.
what? When?
mother told me. He was killed. When they were both quite young.
no-one knows the details.
apparently the whole town was gossiping about it.
I think it all got hushed up, in truth. My point being...
he is quite worthy of your attention, if you only thought fit to give it.
let's get out.
I'm cold.
# You are my honey, honeysuckle # I am the bee # I'd like to sip the honey sweet # From those red lips, you see # I love you dearly, dear And I want...
I wish I could draw you.
sorry. I...
it's all right, I was... I was miles away.
I'm sure they won't do anything.
careful.
what do you think you're doing?
why have you come? You were so long, you... It's not safe.
the bull gored one of the farmer's cows to death the other day.
what do I care of that?
what do you care?
of his cattle?
nothing. I imagine. Have you any idea how much money they are worth?
money. You've been waiting for this moment, haven't you? To feel safe. What are you talking about?
since you invited me to Shortlands, you've wanted me in this position! I'm your equal, Gerald Crich.
you have struck the first blow.
and I shall strike the last.
it's no good being angry with me.
it is you who makes me behave like this.
I'm not angry with you.
miss Brangwen.
I wasn't sure you were in today.
couldn't you see me from the attic?
the line of sight was perfect for me.
you were away all of yesterday. That's why I was uncertain.
indeed.
I feared a cold.
but it seems I'm quite well...
was there anything the matter?
would you...
care to join me for dinner this evening?
I should be delighted if you would.
of course.
Ursula. Oh, my God! I knew you came this way back from school.
what happened? Oh...
it's nothing. I fell.
where have you been? You disappeared from the party. I want you to be with me!
you asked me what I wanted from you. And, erm, that's it.
it's over between me and Hermione.
finally. I want you to be with me.
but...it's not love that I offer you.
well, not in the usual sense.
nor do I want it returned in that form either.
do you understand?
that you don't love me? Except in some...
strange, obscure way which requires a lot of hand wringing. No...
do you find me good-looking, even?
or attractive? It's not a question of looks!
I want a woman that I don't see.
I want...
a union where nothing that is already known applies!
you think I'm raving, don't you?
bash on the bonce and then the ramblings start.
I'm done with this world, Ursula.
it's let me down.
God and man.
now I want to explore...
another way of living...
and what do you hope to find at the end of this great...
expedition of yours?
peace.
a lasting peace.
do you always dress for dinner?
I believe in good manners.
then I apologise if I'm lowering the tone somewhat.
of course, if you'd warned me.
miss Brangwen...
why do you tease me so?
I don't care what you wear.
I do care that you haven't spoken a single word of the other night.
you talk to me of good manners, Mr. Crich?
it happened.
and it was delightful. And now we move on.
dr Oxley is leaving, Sir.
Oh, Gerald.
what is it?
Yes.
sorry.
the doctor wanted to get off. What did he say?
there was some medicine.
new medicine.
Yes. You told me.
right...
but it hasn't worked.
was always a long shot.
so, that's it.
more or less.
just have to wait now.
continue to wait.
what are you doing? I must go.
and...
Yes. You should be alone anyway.
let me drive you. No, I... No, I'd rather walk.
then I'll walk with you.
it's so strange, in our old age, we become like children again...
that's how Father is now.
I'm everything to him...
he could be my son.
you mustn't give up hope.
in our family...once anything goes wrong, it can never be put right again.
you know I killed my brother?
Oh, er...
ursula said that there was an accident when...
when you were both very little.
I shot him.
we found a gun...in the gamekeeper's lodge.
we played with it, as boys do.
it went off.
and I killed him.
they said you no longer resided there. Oh, well!
it was to be a surprise.
So...don't you think it wonderful?
and it's not only the rooms I've given up.
but my job, too...
I've some savings I can draw on and...
I want to write.\n Perhaps I'll be able to sell that.
what matters is...
finding one's own way, Ursula...
refusing to conform. Hm?
Oh! She's just arrived.
where do you want this?
er, just one minute...
she came to apologise.
take me home. Ursula.
Ursula. Take me home!
I ran into her.
in town. She was contrite.
and to show it, she thought she might help you re-arrange your furniture?
I was being decent. Why must I hate her?
she tried to bludgeon you to death.
if you weren't so jealous you'd understand.
Jealous!? Of Hermione Roddice?
she is nothing to me. Not that... It is you I despise.
and your lies!
you're like a dog who must return to his own vomit.
you're a fool. Yes! I am a fool.
and thank God for it. I'm too big a fool to swallow your cleverness.
so go to your soul mate.
since I am common and fleshly, aren't I?
what? I lust after physical things.
I showed you my love and you were repulsed! Afternoon.
no. Yes.
I would have done it, Rupert. There, in the church yard.
I wanted to do it, sex.
because sex is important to me and I am not ashamed to say so.
I wanted to be with you as I understand it.
except, when you felt my need, you pulled away. No.
you did! It turned your stomach! It did not! It did not.
forgive me, I...
I don't know...
I don't know how... I don't know how I should live any more.
every, single breath comes with such responsibility now.
it's something of a burden.
all the more reason not to hide away.
to engage fully.
life is savage, Rupert.
or it is not life at all.
letter for you, Mr. Crich.
thank you, Albert.
there! Can't expect to move into a new place without a few house warming presents, can you?
what?
what are you doing? I came to see you.
Gerald, you're not yourself despite any avowals to the contrary.
laughs: Good old Rupert. Like a mind-reader sometimes.
all right. I want you to come to Africa with me.
Africa? I've bought a mine!
diamonds this time. Got it off a German chap, believe it or not.
I need to go and see it. So...
your father...
of course... I don't mean right away, go, but... soon, I think.
and obviously, from your point of view, there'll be no cost. I'll...
why! Why would I just leave?
why wouldn't you?!
there's...
there's Ursula.
she and I seem to have found a decent understanding lately.
even better! I hoped she'd come.
in fact, I've already... Gerald!
tell me the truth, Gerald.
all this, this trouble and expense. What's the real reason?
I want Gudrun to accompany me.
and I think if her sister and you... What?
I haven't actually been able to ask her myself.
she's in London, she took off.
she's uncertain of me, I think.
but I do know that if she were to spend some proper time with me, then she'd see that I'm serious.
about Gudrun?
you're serious about her?
I enjoy her company.
we've become close. But she's not your sort at all.
what do you mean "my sort"?
look, I bought you a bloody pineapple.
I'm expecting some support over this! Yes, but...
it's not love though.
what?
you're not in love with her?
why do you say that?
I mean... Why do you assume?
well, I assume because, as I'm sure you'd be the first to admit, it is sex which usually binds you to a woman.
and I can only say that for Gudrun, I do have feelings.
Oh, I'm sure you have feelings, Gerald.
but where do they start? And where do they end? Hmmm?
all the same, the four of us.
on an adventure. I think it would be a wonderful tonic, don't you?
no.
you must...
you must put it down.
you must put it down.
be careful.
no. Father!
father, I've had words!
father, please! Father, please!
I want you to write a letter to Miss Brangwen.
tell her to come back, immediately.
say that you're sick.
but she is already here. She called this afternoon.
my lessons resume tomorrow.
Jesus!
Jesus!
is he...?
there.
he looks better now.
I'll give you a minute.
because I must.
slow down. You're going to kill me.
there's a rather lovely simplicity to Gerald, isn't there?
he's a doer. He'll tell anyone that!
Oh, sweets.
I would like a pennyworth of those, please.
hurry up!
for goodness sake! It's going in two minutes. You need to get on board.
and where are you going? To get some cigarettes and a paper.
how are you? Very well, I...
I came to see Rupert off.
prune! Give me a hand with my case, will you?
God, what a mess.
it's a different world.
my God, Gerry.
you've done it now. Do we have to ride?
after a journey like that? I want to stretch my legs a little.
by all means, Rupert. It's 120 degrees.
you take Shank's. I'll take the pony.
it's about two hours, apparently.
finally. Our place. You've reached our place.
I don't have to. Every time.
the settlers just went.
as soon as the next haul of diamonds or gold was discovered, they just upped and offed.
why couldn't they be satisfied?
because people never are.
encore!
see? A question...
Gluttons! HE LAUGHS
what?
you've convinced me, finally. I surrender to my heritage.
to the visceral, sodden, Midlands and their dirty, dirty, men.
they are getting it, your friends, the Schuhplattern.
bless you!
I mean the dance. That is its name, Schuhplattern.
bloody exhausting, that's what we'd call it in England.
gerald Crich. I'm Wolfgang Loerke.
and I'm... Gudrun Brangwen.
I saw your name in the register. I am an artist, too.
your work is in Berlin.
No! A private collection in the Altes Museum.
good heavens...
please, sit down.
so. which one...
the Altes Museum. A private collection on loan.
mein Herr? My niece would be most pleased to dance with you.
Ah, I see.
isn't her English very good?
my English is perfect.
but one would hate to give the impression that German girls do not know how to behave in polite company.
in that case, the pleasure is all mine.
the young woman is, how do you say it?
she is Von Bluuten.
it's, er, like a lady.
from one of the oldest families in Bavaria.
how can you say that? We love each other.
we can do anything. We make our own rules.
Yes, of course.
Gerald, what a fine game you played tonight.
hmm? Isn't she in love with you? What?
that girl, what was her name?
the one you danced with? God knows. She was, er...
I assure you, I addressed her quite formally all night.
well, it obviously did the trick.
I can picture her, Gerald, even now, lying there, overwhelmed with love for you.
it really was too shameful, the way you swept her off her feet.
that was the Schuhplattern. It's not a criticism.
she was very confident.
on the other hand, it would make a perfect marriage.
the upper classes uniting across Europe.
stop it.
for God's sake, what's the matter with you?
tell me you weren't hard when you held her against you...
and I'll cease this instant.
race you.
see!
what? You're done.
you've no strength.
winner!
what are you talking about?
the walls aren't terribly thick, you know, Gerald. What?
no wonder you're tired.
I suspect you're the only one who's been indulging in it quite so vigorously. Enough!
what? Ah.
all the...fucking time! What are you talking about?!
you never fucking stop! Sex is what brings a man to a woman.
what?
but that doesn't mean... What are you talking about?
meaningful union...that you speak of.
that happens... That happens...
once the ardour is played out.
you're right.
where sex is...
earth and sea and water and air.
it's commonplace.
as long as we admit it.
that it makes machines of all of us for a while...
then we pass through it to the other side where you sit so proudly...
I know about love!
don't fucking lecture me!
prune, you must have something. You'll make yourself ill.
a drink at least.
curry.
God, this place is wonderful!
I could live here forever.
you should, then. Just like that?
why not? If you desire something, you should make it happen.
there speaks a man who has wanted for nothing his entire life.
I'm going.
what? You're right.
I'm here to get things done. It's too hot now! Don't be ridiculous.
wait!
I know I've made you like this.
but I have to be.
perhaps if you weren't so...
I have to be true to myself...
and Rupert's right. You come from a different world.
what?
they're yours alone, and I can't be with somebody like that.
I think we should have separate rooms.
what are you talking about? This is...
you can say that you need a dressing room. Or I am ill.
gudrun, this is nonsense.
all over some dance.
I don't give two ha'pennies for the bloody girl!
she is nothing to me. She's not the point. It's your whole attitude.
it's who you are.
if you face facts, Gerald...Please be sensible.
it's best to stop this now before...
before it becomes serious.
before? What?
Jesus! I took pity on you because of the dreadful state you were in.
it was never love.
not really.
it's always been perfectly clear what this relationship's about.
I...
and that's not the same thing, is it?
not really.
not proper love.
because you don't feel like that, do you?
and you never will. You'll...
you'll never love me as a man should.
because you're not capable.
of loving me like that. Are you?
no.
well, then...
let's be kind to ourselves. We should be friends.
and nothing more.
gerald is like the richest food in the world. He's...
he's delicious at first, but he's deadening finally.
it's lack of subtlety.
Gudrun! It's best that we're honest about these things.
life's too short for compromise.
now, if you'll excuse me...
I'm ravenous.
Jesus!
what happened to you?
my beautiful companion...
prefers the company of some...
hideous portrait pedlar.
and I am getting drunk. That's it.
for God's sake, Gerald. Pull yourself to together. Go and talk to her.
what are you doing?
I'm giving this young woman the eye.
couldn't you just take her outside and ride her until the sweat sat in puddles on her collarbone?
I could.
I could.
I do like her, though.
you'll write?
of course.
you really must go?
we must. I think Rupert's right.
we're not helping.
and you will manage here with Gerald?
perhaps not together.
but we'll manage.
I want you to have these.
sweets for my sweet.
the most beautiful things I possess...
for the most beautiful woman I know.
come with us.
we could travel together.
no. I'm perfectly fine.
you shouldn't stay. You say that, but you're not. Really.
really, I am.
you're pretending.
you never tell the truth, ever, where it concerns your heart, and it will be the end of you!
and you do. You always tell the truth. And you always have.
and I've been so envious of that all my life.
I daren't love him.
gerald is...
he's a hundred men. He's a thousand men.
how can I keep him?
prune, no. You...
please, come. No. Go.
go.
Ah... I forgot my wash bag.
does this mean you'll be coming for dinner this evening?
no. I shouldn't think so.
do you wish to humiliate me?
isn't it enough that...
mightn't we at least keep up the appearance of civility?
I'm being perfectly civil, Gerald.
it's you who's rapidly forgetting his manners.
what are you doing? I'm getting ready.
that's your way, isn't it?
you are confronted by a problem and you overcome it, don't you?
you just have to grasp the nature and then you bring to pass the inevitable conclusion,at the colliery or in the war.
you make order out of chaos by imposing your will, don't you?
not with me.
I bow to no man.
I said I'd strike the last blow.
and I will. Why him? Hmmm?
why the vermin?
don't be ridiculous. It's clear you want him, not me.
that's what this is about.
I want nothing of him!
why do men reduce everything to a matter of sex?
because everything IS a matter of sex!
I'll make my own way to England.
and I'm leaving on Friday.
if it's to England that I go...
let me go!
you are... You are going away, then?
Yes.
day after tomorrow.
where? I don't know.
you won't tell me where you will go?
really, I don't know.
Maria!
you come like a ghost.
some schnapps?
perhaps the lady would care for another sip?
stop it!
stop it! Stop it!
stop it.
I loved him so much.
I know...
I...
I know.
Oh, God!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I've had enough.
I want to go to sleep.
Hey, YOUR PHONE WAS OFF.
I HAD TO T-POD A GUY FROM A MOTORCYCLE MISHAP.
kid's leather pants were holding him together.
why DO YOU PUT THESE IMAGES IN MY HEAD? LOOK, I JUST GOT HERE. DID YOU GRAB A TABLE?
I had to go. We split a salad.
they're HOLDING YOUR HALF AT THE BAR. I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
dusting LAMPS FOR 10 BUCKS AN HOUR.
what A W TO SPEND YOUR LAST NIGHT ON EARTH.
judging BY THESE LACERATIONS,
he WAS BEATEN WITH SOMETHING SMALL,
heavy AND ANGULAR.
like A PORTABLE RADIO?
THIRD-SHIFT GUY SAID HIS WAS MISSING WHEN HE FOUND HIM.
missing
and PROBABLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BAY BY NOW.
a TALE OF TWO CITIES.
at LEAST HE HAD STOPPED READING
before THE SAD PART.
Ben COOPER. WHY DO I KNOW THAT NAME?
our JANITOR DID NOT GO DOWN EASY.
Yeah, BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE.
is HE SOMEONE I ARRESTED ONCE?
so ONE POSSIBILITY
is SOMEONE CAME HERE TO ROB THE WAREHOUSE,
janitor HEADS OUT FOR A SMOKE, FINDS THE ROBBER, GETS KILLED FOR HIS TROUBLE. YEAH, EXCEPT WE CHECKED THE WAREHOUSE.
nothing's MISSING.
tell ME YOU DIDN'T DRIVE THIS HERE.
please. I DROVE MAGGIE, MY LITTLE RED CAR.
and THEN YOU SWEET-TALKED OFFICER CHO
into SNEAKING YOU PAST THE TAPE.
wait, YOUR CAR HAS A NAME? DOESN'T YOURS?
so YOU WERE SAYING, NOT A ROBBERY.
no, THIS IS A LOW-RENT PLACE WITHOUT SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS.
a ROBBER WOULD'VE COME IN,
taken WHAT HE WANTED ONCE THE JANITOR WAS DEAD.
I THINK THIS WAS PERSONAL. THERE'S BLOOD AND SKIN UNDER THE VICTIM'S FINGERNAILS.
we CAN GET THE KILLER'S D. N.A. FROM THAT. TITLE SEARCH WILL GIVE US THE OWNER OF THE WAREHOUSE
and ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE PROPERTY. THE ONLY QUESTION
is WHETHER THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON HERE
that WOULDN'T BE ON THE BOOKS. DULL PLACES ARE THE BEST FRONTS.
I'll CHAT UP THE LOCALS, SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING MORE INTERESTING FOR SALE HERE AT THE HOUSE OF LAMPS, LAMPS AND MORE LAMPS.
all RIGHT, MAGGIE.
where SHOULD WE START?
just KEEP DRIVING. DON'T SCREAM. I GOT A GUN.
my NAME'S JAMIE GALVAN. OH, GOD.
I'm NOT GONNA HURT YOU. NO, YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME
because YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME YO NAME UNLESS-- I JUST NEED YOUR HELP.
to FLEE A CRIME SCENE
where YOU JUST BEAT A GUY TO DEATH WITH A RADIO.
Ben COOPER WAS DEAD WHEN I GOT THERE. YOU EXPECT ME
my DAD IS IN JAIL, OKAY? DEATH ROW.
Ben COOPER WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS GONNA HELP HIM OUT.

deep BREATH. JUST LISTEN TO ME.
you're A CRIME REPORTER FOR THE "REGISTER.
I've SEEN YOUR FACE ON THE BYLINE PICTURE.
I HAVE TWO DAYS TO STOP AN EXECUTION. WAIT, IS YOUR FATHER

in TWO DAYS, YEAH.
listen, MY DAD'S INNOCENT. OKAY?
and I--I'VE READ YOUR WORK.
you CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE,
and YOU'RE-- YOU'RE SMART.
now YOU'RE JUST GETTING ALL FLATTERER-Y.
you DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED OF ME.
maybe IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GUN.
I DON'T. OKAY?
you CAN PULL OVER.
what?
listen, THIS IS EVERYTHING THERE IS ABOUT MY DAD'S CASE.
I'm PUTTING HIS LIFE IN YOUR HANDS.
where DO I KNOW THIS GUY FROM?
does HE GO TO MY COFFEE SHOP?
is HE MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL GYM COACH?
was HE MY MAILMAN? WHA
you're SITTING. YOU NEVER SIT.
Ugh. IT'S LATE. I'M TIRED. GO ON.
all RIGHT.
I'm WAITING FOR THE RESULTS ON THE KILLER'S D.N.A.
what DID COOPER'S BACKGROUND CHECK SHOW?
um, NO NEXT OF KIN.
a FEW DRUG ARRESTS YEARS AGO.
well, NO SIGNS OF RECENT DRUG USE.
are YOU COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING?
come ON. LET ME FEEL YOUR FOREHEAD.
I DO NOT HAVE A FEVER, MOM.
I'm NOT CUTTING THIS MAN OPEN TILL YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.
okay.
look, JUST BETWEEN US.
Mm-hmm.
it's THE THIRD WEEK OF THE MONTH.
at LEAST IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ME.
but IT'S NOT.
I'm LATE.
late? YOU WORK TOO HARD, YOU DON'T EAT RIGHT.
cycles GET OFF BALANCE SOMETIMES.
I MEAN,
at LEAST WE KNOW YOU'OT PREGNANT.
I MEAN, WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT
an IMMACULATE CONCEPTION, RIGHT?
well, I...
may HAVE HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND.
girl, A ONE-NIGHT STAND IS A BIG STEP FORWARD FOR YOU.
okay, IN A WAY. WHO'S THE GUY?
Yes.
your EX-HUSBAND/BOSS
WHO'S-GETTING-REMARRIED- IN-A-MATTER-OF-WEEKS TOM?
okay.
really MORE OF A BACKWARDS STEP.
Oh, MY GOD!
and NO ONE THOUGHT TO USE PROTECTION?
y-yes, WE DID. WE THOUGHT.
the... CONDOM WAS KIND OF OLD.
how OLD WAS THIS ANTIQUE CONDOM? OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
latex IS VERY DURABLE.
okay, PLEASE DON'T FOCUS ON THAT POINT.
it WAS A ONETIME THING. OH, MY GOD.
it WAS A MISTAKE. OH, MY GOD.
whatever. WILL YOU STOP SAYING "OH, MY GOD"?
MNH-MNH-MNH. WHAT?
text MESSAGE FROM CINDY.
she WANTS TO MEET US IN THE DINER. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM?
there's NOTHING TO TELL HIM YET. EVER.
we're JUST KEEPING OUR DISTANCE.
clearly, THAT'S WORKING FOR YOU.
I'll DO YOUR PREGNANCY TEST.
Hello? I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF SOLVING A MURDER.
and CINDY JUST SAID SHE HAS SOMETHING ON THE CRIME.
and IF YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT...
my SLEEPING WITH TOM,
I WILL COME AT YOU WITH THAT BONE SAW.
I'm NOT SAYING A WORD.
I'm PUTTING MR. COOPER IN THE FRIDGE,
and I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN TEN.
I SO DON'T FEEL BETTER NOW THAT WE'VE TALKED.
uh, GIVE ME TEN.
Hey, LINZ. HOW YOU DOING?
fine. WHY DO YOU ASK?
well, MY--MY MAMA
taught ME A LITTLE THING CALLED BEING POLITE.
seven YEARS AGO, BEN COOPER
was THE KEY EYEWITNESS IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION.
his TESTIMONY CONVICTED A MAN NAMED PAUL GALVAN.
the VICTIM WAS A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO WORKED IN YOUR BUILDING. THAT'S WHY I KNOW BEN COOPER'S NAME.
do YOU KNOW THIS CASE?
uh, D.D. A. TRACY WELNG WAS RAPED AND MURDERED
in HER APARTMENT. NO, BEFORE MY TIME.
well, BEN COOPER LIED ON THE STAND.
his TESTIMONY PUT AN INNOCENT MAN ON DEATH ROW.
but HE WAS ABOUT TO RECANT. AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?
uh, THE GUY WHO IS ON DEATH ROW,
I SORT OF MET HIS SON JAMIE.
how'd YOU MEET HIM?
just AROUND.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I-I MEET PEOPLE.
so BETWEEN THE LAST TIME WE SAW YOU AND NOW,
you MET PAUL GALVAN'S SON.
please DON'T GIVE ME THE LASER VISION.
it MAKES ME REALLY NERVOUS. ALL RIGHT.
all RIGHT, I WASN'T GONNA SAY ANYTHING BEFORE
because THIS IS GONNA SOUND REALLY, REALLY BAD,
but IT ACTUALLY ISN'T, SO JUST HEAR ME OUT.
Jamie... GOT INTO MY CAR AT THE CRIME SCENE.
you WENT OFF WITH A TOTAL STRANGER?
have WE TAUGHT YOU NOTHING? HE SAID HE HAD A GUN.
what? HE KIDNAPPED YOU?
are YOU OKAY? HE WAS VERY SINCERE.
n-not ABOUT THE GUN. HE MADE THAT PART UP.
he KIDNAPPED YOU. NOT REALLY.
pretend GUNPOINT" STILL COUNTS AS BEING RESTRAINED AGAINST YOUR WILL.
let's TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL, GET YOU CHECKED OUT.
he DIDN'T TOUCH ME. I'M FINE. TELL ME EVERYTHING. START WITH A DESCRIPTION.
um, OKAY, HE WAS KIND OF... CUTE.
and HE HAD A LITTLE BLOOD ON HIS SHIRT.
more, PLEASE. YOU GUYS, AN INNOCENT MAN IS ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED
in, LIKE, 48 HOURS.
check, PLEASE.
it WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER TRIAL.
but IT WAS YOUR FIRST BIG CASE
second CHAIR
and THE VICTIM WORKED IN THIS OFFICE.
we HAD THE KILLER COLD-- CRIMINAL RECORD,
fingerprints AT THE SCENE, BULLETPROOF EYEWITNESS, DONE.
an EYEWITNESS NAMED BEN COOP, RIGHT?
what IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU
Cooper WAS ABOUT TO RECANT HIS TESTIMONY?
I WOULD SAY THAT SOMEBODY WAS A CONSPIRACY THEORIST IN NEED OF ATTENTION,
and I'D ADVISE HIM OR HER TO GO START A BLOG.
been MEANING TO CALL YOU.
I SPENT SOME TIME WORKING ON
your BOYFRIEND'S MALPRACTICE CASE.
I've ADVISED HIS ATTORNEYS TO MOVE FOR DISMISSAL
on THE GROUNDS OF-- YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING.
I'm SORRY. THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
Yes, IT IS.
and I KNOW THAT LOOK, SO WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
I WAS TALKING TO DENISE ABOUT ONE OF HER OLD CASES.
I'm TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HER ANGLE IS. GOOD LUCK.
speak OF THE DEVIL. YOU READY TO GO? YEAH.
good SEEING YOU, COUNSELOR. GOOD NIGHT, JILL.
good NIGHT.
jamie GALVAN'S LAST KNOWN ADDRESS
is APARTMENT 2B, SECOND FLOOR.
so...
this GUY KIDNAPS YOUR FRIEND,
tells HER HE HAS A GUN,
and, UH, SHE THINKS HE'S "CUTE"?
Yeah, SHE DEFINITELY USED THE WORD "CUTE."
why DO YOU HANG OUT WITH THIS GIRL?
some WOMEN JUST LOSE ALL SENSE OF REALITY IN THE FACE OF CUTENESS,
apparently EVEN IF THE GUY IS FLEEING A MURDER SCENE.
a SCENE AT WHICH HE HAD OPPORTUNITY, MEANS AND MOTIVE.
and BLOOD ON HIS SHIRT. YOU'RE WITH ME ON THIS.
100%.
Aah! WATCH OUT!
Whoa!
make THAT 95.
I'm JILL BERNHARDT.
San FRANCISCO D. A.'s OFFICE.
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR TRIAL.
seven YEARS AGO, BEN COOPER TESTIFIED HE SAW YOU LEAVING D.A. TRACY WELLING'S APARTMENT THE NIGHT SHE WAS MURDERED.
Yeah. SHE LIVED DOWNSTAIRS FROM ME.
but I ONLY REMEMBER BEING IN HER PLACE ONCE.
tell ME.
I WAS TRYING TO GET A JOB
because MY DISABILITY CHECKS HAD RUOUT.
but I HAD DONE SOME TIME FOR MY D.U.I. s,
so... TRACY SAT ME DOWN IN HER LIVING ROOM
and WROTE ME A CHARACTER REFERENCE.
it MEANT A LOT. IS THAT WHY YOU SENT ROSES TO HER OFFICE THREE MONDAYS IN A ROW?
I HAD A CRUSH ON HER.
after A FEW WEEKS, I TOOK THE HINT...
I THINK.
back THEN I WAS A BLACKOUT DRUNK.
so THERE'S, UH, LOTS OF STUFF I DON'T REMEMBER,
including THE NIGHT OF TRACY'S MURDER.
and THAT'S WHY YOU WAIVED YOUR LAST APPEALS, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU DIDN'T DO IT?
well, MY LAWYER WAS USELESS ANYWAY.
I'm NOT A RAPIST...
or A MURDERER.
but WHEN YOU CAN'T REMEMBER A WHOLE DAY OF YOUR LIFE,
it GETS PRETTY HARD TO DEFEND YOURSELF.
I DON'T WANT JAMIE FIGHTING THIS.
he CAN'T STOP THE EXECUTION.
he NEEDS TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND MOVE ON.
you TELL HIM I SAID THAT.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.
there WAS A GAS EXPLOSION AT JAMIE'S APARTMENT.
what?
is HE HURT?
is HE DEAD?
we DON'T KNOW YET.
Hey, UH, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WOULDN'T LET US IN TILL THIS MORNING.
the GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S NO HUMAN REMAINS,
so WE STILL HAVE A SUSPECT IN OUR JANITOR'S MURDER.
unis CANVASSED ALL THE NEIGHBORS.
came UP WITH A WHOLE LOT OF NOTHING.
so THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL WHETHER JAMIE RIGGED THIS
to COVER HIS TRACKS AFTER KILLING BEN COOPER.
or IF SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SILCE JAMIE
the WAY THEY SILENCED BEN COOPER.
I'm GONNA, UH, HEAD BACK TO THE HALL.
I HAD EVERYTHING
on THE TRACY WELLING MURDER TRIAL PULLED.
whatever's GOING ON HERE, I THINK IT ALL GOES BACK TO THAT.
D. A. PRATT. GOOD MORNING, SIR.
I WAS LOOKING FOR THE ARCHIVES OF TRACY
Denise, HOPE YOU HAD YOUR ESPRESSO.
you HAVE THE JURISDICTION EXHIBITS READY? YES, TO BOTH SIR.
Bernhardt, YOU WERE SAYING? YOU'RE BUSY.
I'll COME BACK LATER. NO, NO. YOU'VE GOT ME NOW.
what ABOUT THE ARCHIVES?
I WAS RESEARCHING THE TRACY WELLING MURDER TRIAL.
the TRANSCRIPTS ARE MISSING. PROBABLY OUT BEING DIGITIZED.
I DIDN'T ASK FOR ANY RESEARCH. YOU WERE FIRST CHAIR.
you GOT THE DEATH PENALTY FOR PAUL GALVAN.
if I COULD HAVE A FEW MINUTES OF YOUR TIME TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
one OF YOUR D. D.A. s HAS TIME
to LOOK INTO CASES FROM SEVEN YEARS AGO?
now I THOUGHT RAN A TIGHT SHIP. NOT TO WORRY, BRUCE.
I'll BE UPPING HER CASELOAD.
my RESEARCH IS PART OF A CURRENT MURDER INVESTIGATION.
call MY ASSISTANT. SHE'LL GET YOU ON THE BOOKS.
no, I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT.
can YOU HEAR ME?
crap.
girls, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW
son OF DEATH ROW GUY HAD MEANS, MOTIVE AND OPPORTUNITY TO KILL BEN COOPER LAST NIGHT.
he FLED THE CRIME SCENE, KIDNAPPED CINDY,
and THEN WENT ON THE RUN.
his NAME IS JAMIE GALVAN, AND HE ONLY WENT ON THE RUN
because SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL HIM.
listen, MY INSTINCTS ARE TELLING ME THAT THIS-- SHH. YOU, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE INSTINCTS.
and I'M NOT SAYING THAT JAMIE HAS TO BE THE KILLER,
but I AM SAYING THAT THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION
is USUALLY THE RIGHT ONE. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE JAMIE MIGHT HAVE GONE?
we ISSUED A "BE ON THE LOOKOUT" FOR HIM,
but NO SIGHTINGS OF HIM YET.
we DO KNOW THAT HE'S POSTING ON HIS WEB SITE.
organizing A PROTEST OUTSIDE SAN QUENTIN.
we FAXED JAMIE'S PHOTO TO EVERY Wi-Fi SPOT IN THE CITY.
Meanwhile...
I PULLED ALL THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE ON THE TRACY WELLING MURDER TRIAL, AS REQUESTED.
we're REOPENING THE CASE? COOL.
no, WE'RE NOT REOPENING ANYTHING.
we're TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
who MURDERED OUR JANITOR BEN COOPER,
and IF HIS TESMONY IN THE OLD TRIAL
had ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.
I CALLED EVERY ARCHIVE IN THE STATE.
no ONE CAN FIND THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE TRIAL.
our TAXPAYER DOLLARS AT WORK.
and NO ONE IN MY DEPARTMENT WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE CASE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'D MIND. EVERYTHING SEEMS IN ORDER HERE.
no SEMEN ON TRACY WELLING'S BODY,
but THERE WAS OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF RAPE.
cause OF DEATH WAS ASPHYXIA DUE TO SUFFOCATION.
and THERE WAS SOME UNIDENTIFIED BLOOD SAMPLE FOUND IN TRACY WELLING'S KITCHEN SINK.
unidentified AS IN NOT PAUL GALVAN'S?
unidentified AS IN UNIDENTIFIED.
wait, JAMIE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE NOTEBOOKS.
uh, THE PROSECUTION SAID
that ANYONE COULD'VE LEFT THE BLOOD THERE,
even WEEKS BEFORE THE CRIME HAPPENED. PAUL'S PUBLIC DEFENDER
should've POINTED TO THAT BLOOD AS REASONABLE DOUBT.
can YOU RETEST THAT BLOOD SAMPLE?
Yeah, GLAD TO. ANY OTHER TESTS WE SHOULD RUN?
not RIGHT NOW.
Jill, DID YOU GO TO DEATH ROW
and TALK TO PAUL GALVAN?
I DID. I LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE.
I THINK HE'S INNOCENT.
I'm GONNA APPLY FOR A STAY OF HIS EXECUTION. OUR CLUB ROCKS.
it's NOT A CLUB. EXCUSE ME.
none OF THIS PROVES THAT CUTE JAMIE GALVAN
didn't KILL BEN COOPER LAST NIGHT. JAMIE DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.
I'm WITH HER. I'M UNDECIDED, BUT SYMPATHETIC.
I'm TOUCHED THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE THE BEST IN PEOPLE.
I AM A COP. I DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.
you GO ON YOUR GUT ALL THE TIME. YOU CAN TAKE ONE LOOK AT A GUY
and I HAVEN'T SEEN JAMIE GALVAN
because AFTER HE KIDNAPPED YOU,
he DISAPPEARED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
by WHICH I MEAN NO ONE HAS HEARD FROM HIM.
am I RIGHT?
Yeah.
totally.
worst LIAR EVER.
don't MAKE ME CHARGE YOU WITH OBSTRUCTION.
you START WHIPPING OUT THE CHARGES.
please SPARE US ALL THE PAIN OF WATCHING YOU TRY TO BLUFF.
I'm NOT BLUFFING, I'M...
if... JAMIE WERE TO HAVE
sent ME A TEXT MESSAGE, SAY THIS MORNING...
I WOULD HAVE PROMISED
to KEEP THAT TEXT MESSAGE A SECRET.
Hey.
Hey.
sorry. I'M, UH, I'M WRECKED.
I, UH, COULDN'T EXACTLY GO HOME AND CHANGE.
or SLEEP?
I'm, UH, I'M ALL RIGHT. SO YOU HAVE SOME NEWS?
I TALKED TO A LAWYER.
she's PUTTING TOGETHER AN EMERGENCY APPLICATION FOR A STAY OF YOUR DAD'S EXECUTION.
WYERS ALWAYS TURN ME DOWN.
HOW--HOW'D YOU GET HER TO DO THAT?
she's A FRIEND.
and I, UM... I HAVE ANOTHER FRIEND
I'd LIKE FOR YOU TO MEET.
I'm INSPECTOR LINDSAY BOXER.
you SET ME UP? YOU CAN TRUST HER.
nowhere TO GO, JAMIE.
outta MY WAY.
that's NOT GONNA HELP. YOU GOOD?
Yeah, I'M GOOD.
God.
I DIDN'T KILL BEN COOPER.
you WERE AT THE CRIME SCENE. YOU ABDUCTED CINDY THOMAS.
Ben COOPER WAS GONNA CHANGE HIS TESTIMONY.
he WAS THE ONE PERSON
that WANTED TO ACTUALLY HELP MY DAD.
I WOULD NOT HAVE HURT HIM. OPEN.
I'm HAVING YOUR D.N.A. TESTED AGAINST THE BLOOD WE FOUND UNDER BEN COOPER'S FINGERNAILS.
label THAT RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING MESSING WITH THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE.
it's ATTITUDE LIKE THAT THAT MAKES ME THINK-- I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK!
they're GONNA EXECUTE MY DAD IN 36 HOURS.
if I CAN'T HELP HIM,
then THAT PUTS THE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.
what ABOUT THAT BLOOD ON YOUSHIRT?
when I FOUND BEN COOPER, I WAS TRYING TO HELP HIM.
I TOUCHED HIS HEAD. I'M SO TIRED OF THIS STORY.
it's, UH, NEW TO ME. I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.
may I?
Jamie's STORY IS VERY CONSISTENT.
let's SEE WHAT HIS D. N.A. SAYS.
heard YOU WALKED INTO A DOOR. NO, THANKS.
I CAN'T BE A WUSS AND DRIVE AT THE SAME TIME.
you LET HER DRIVE? WE'RE GOING TO WALNUT CREEK.
I DON'T DO THE CALDECOTT TUNNEL.
we HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A GUY NAMED HENRY DOW.
he's STILL THE BUILDING MANAGER OF THE PLACE
where TRACY WELLING AND BEN COOPER
and PAUL GALVAN USED TO LIVE. LOT OF NAMES IN THIS CASE.
keep UP, TOM.
thanks FOR TAKING JAMIE ON AS A CLIENT.
got ANOTHER FAVOR TO ASK.
well, KEEP TALKING. I LIKE IT WHEN YOU OWE ME.
I'm APPLYING TO HAVE HIS FATHER'S EXECUTION STAYED.
well, THAT, UH,
that's A DELICATE PROPOSITION
given THAT YOU'RE WITH THE SAME D. A.'s OFFICE THAT PUT GALVAN AWAY.
that's WHY I NEED A DEFENSE ATTORNEY
to FILE THE APPLICATION.
hmm.
I'm IN.
just LIKE THAT?
no QUID PRO QUO?
your DEATH ROW PRISONER MIGHT BE INNOCENT.
and IN MY OPINION,
that's A GOOD ENOUGH REASON NOT TO KILL HIM.
this WILL ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES.
okay.
cute KIDS.
hmm. THANKS.
my SISTER'S.
at LEAST NOW I HAVE AN EXTRA ROOM FOR THEM
when THEY COME TO VISIT.
of COURSE, I HAVEN'T TOLD THE KI WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
this IS TRACY WELLING'S OLD APARTMENT.
was, UH, THAT HER BEDROOM BACK THERE?
Yep.
Yeah, NOBODY WANTED TO RENT THIS PLACE AFTER THE MURDER,
so THE LANDLORD MADE ME TAKE IT,
by THEN HALF THE TENANTS HAD ALREADY MOVED OUT.
but I HAD IT REPAINTED, PUT NEW FURNITURE IN.
would YOU MIND PUTTING THOSE PHOTOS AWAY? SORRY.
when DID YOU MEET BEN COOPER?
uh, HIRED HIM IN '99. HE WAS JUST OUT OF REHAB,
but HE WAS TRYING TO GO STRAIGHT.
but HE HAD THESE FRIENDS WHO KEPT COMING, LOOKING TO SCORE.
so THAT'S WHY I HAD TO EVENTUALLY LET HIM GO. DID YOU STAY IN TOUCH AFTER THAT?
Mnh-mnh. HADN'T SEEN HIM IN YEARS.
Why?
we're TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN TELL US ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH JAMIE GALVAN, PAUL'S SON.
I WOULDN'T EXPECT THEM TO BE FRIENDS.
I REMEMBER JAMIE FROM THE TRIAL. HE SEEMED A LITTLE OFF.
W-what DO YOU MEAN, OFF?
when THEY READ THE GUILTY VERDICT, HE
the KID WENT OUT OF HIS HEAD.
I MEAN, THE BAILIFF HAD TO HOLD HIM DOWN.
hell OF A TEMPER, LIKE HIS FATHER.
you THINK JAMIE HAD IT IN HIM TO, UH, KILL A MAN?
like I SAID, APPLE DON'T FALL FAR.
Ben COOPER'S FALSE TESTIMONY
caused A SEVERE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE SEVEN YEARS AGO.
D.D.A. TRACY WELLING
was A HIGHLY RESPECTED MEMBER OF MY OFFICE. I'M SORRY, YOUR HONOR.
the D. A.'s KEY EYEWITNESS WAS ABOUT TO RECANT.
an ASSERTION BASED ON A PRINTOUT FROM A WEB PAGE OF JAMIE GALVAN'S
a SUPPOSED, UH, E-MAIL FROM BEN COOPER
a MAN WHO'S NOW DEAD
and CAN NEITHER CONFIRM OR DENY ANY OF THIS.
you CAN'T TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. SOMEBODY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.
Ben COOPER ENDED UP DEAD LAST NIGHT.
sorry.
sorry, YOUR HONOR. UNDER THE RULE OF PLAIN ERROR,
paul GALVAN MUST BE GRANTED A NEW TRIAL. PAUL GALVAN'S ROMANTIC ADVANCES
had BEEN REJECTED BY THE VICTIM ON NUMEROUS-- OH, I'VE BEEN REJECTED PLENTY OF TIMES,
and THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME A MURDERER. GALVAN WAS AN EX-CON
and A BLACKOUT DRUNK WITH A VIOLENT TEMPER.
and--and BEN COOPER, A RELIABLE EYEWITNESS,
came FORWARD OF HIS OWN VOLITION
and GAVE AN EXACT DESCRIPTION OF PAUL GALVAN LEAVING D.D.A. TRACY WELLING'S APARTMENT ON THE NIGHT OF HER MURDER.
ms. BERNHARDT, ANYTHING TO ADD?
I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID MORE THAN ENOUGH,
your HONOR. I'M INCLINED TO AGREE.
Tracy WELLING'S FAMILY HAS WAITED SEVEN YEARS FOR JUSTICE.
paul GALVAN HAS BEEN WAITING FOR JUSTICE AS WELL, YOUR HONOR.
I've HEARD NOTHING TO SUGGEST THAT HE HASN'T RECEIVED IT.
and SINCE THIS LETTER FROM BEN COOPER
to JAMIE GALVAN CAN'T BE VERIFIED AS GENUINE,
neither CAN WE VERIFY BEN COOPER'S
alleged INTENTION TO RECANT.
application FOR STAY OF EXECUTION
is SUMMARILY DENIED. ALL WE'RE ASKING
is FOR THE TIME TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH. MS. THOMAS, I'D RATHER NOT
have YOU ARRESTED FOR CONTEMPT. WELL, WOULD YOU RATHER GO
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Oh, OTHER THAN TO OFFER MY BELATED YET HEARTFELT APOLOGIES FOR SETTING UP YOUR TAKEDOWN,
which I ONLY DID BECAUSE I KNOW
that MY FRIENDS WILL HELP YOU,
I GOT ARRESTED FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT.
we HAD THIS TOTAL NEOCON JUDGE
he TURNED DOWN THE STAY, DIDN HE?
Yeah. LISTEN, TELL YOUR FRIENDS
that I SAID THANKS
and GET ME THE HELL OUTTA HERE.
you SHOULD BE NICER TO HER.
she DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
first OF ALL, TODAY'S JUDGE WAS NOT THE END OF THE ROAD.
the NEXT STOP IS THE U. S. COURT OF APPEALS.
second, I DID THE ELIMINARY BLOOD TYPING ON JAMIE'S D.N.A.
and IT'S NOT A MATCH TO THE FINGERNAIL SCRAPINGS FROM BEN COOPER'S BODY.
proving THAT JAMIE DID NOT KILL BEN COOPER LAST NIGHT.
you SEE? I TOLD YA.
so IS THAT PIZZA SOME FORM OF APOLOGY?
do YOU WANT THE BREADSTICKS OR NOT?
she's SORRY THAT SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.
WHICLEAVES THE KIDNAPPING. DO YOU WANT TO PRESS CHARGES?
over A LITTLE FAKE GUNPLAY? NAH, I'M COOL. THANKS.
I HAD TO ASK.
I, TOO, AM DECLINING TO PRESS CHARGES FOR ASSAULT ON A POLICE OFFICER.
so...
guess WHAT DID MATCH THE FINGERNAIL SCRAPINGS WE GOT OFF BEN COOPER'S BODY?
the UNIDENTIFIED BLOOD
found IN TRACY WELLING'S APARTMENT IN 2000.
what ARE THE ODDS?
unless THE SAME PERSON MURDERED THEM BOTH.
which MEANS THAT TRACY WELLING'S KILLER
is STILL OUT THERE AND STILL KILLING PEOPLE.
and PAUL GALVAN IS ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.
we HAVE 24 HOURS TO CATCH A DOUBLE MURDERER
and TO SAVE YOUR FATHER'S LIFE.
Hey, HONEY. I'M SORRY I NEVER CAME HOME LAST NIGHT.
I've BEEN WORKING ON A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
to TRY TO GET AN EXECUTION POSTPONED.
we've GOT 17 HOURS LEFT.
I'll CALL YOU LATER.
I LOVE YOU.
why THE GUILTY LOOK?
you're NOT LYING TO HIM.
at LEAST NOT ABOUT WORKING ALL NIGHT.
on AN 80-PAGE WRIT
supported MAINLY BY WHAT?
hope? CHUTZPAH?
U KNOW THIS IS A HAIL MARY.
I CERTAINLY DO.
but I CAN NEVER RESIST A CHALLENGE.
we NEED MORE COFFEE.
Oh, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
I'm HAVING JACOBI TRACK DOWN
all OF BEN COOPER'S OLD DRUG ACQUAINTANCES.
the UNIs ARE CANVASSING HIS NEIGHBORHOOD AGAIN.
meanwhile TOM IS CALLING EVERYONE WHO KNEW OUR LAWYER VICTIM TRACY WELLINGBACK IN THE DAY.
what AM I MISSING?
how ABOUT A PLAN FROM YOU?
I'm THROWING EVERYTHING AGAINST THE WALL.
not ABOUT THE CASE. ABOUT TOM.
what IF YOU FIND OUT YOU'RE PREGNANT?
Oh, I'M NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.
okay, MAYBE JUST A LITTLE.
would YOU KEEP THE BABY?
of COURSE.
and WHEN WOULD YOU TELL TOM,
before OR AFTER THE WEDDING?
because IF IT'S BEFORE,
you KNOW HE'LL PROBABLY CALL IT OFF.
I'm NOT TRYING TO BREAK UP TOM'S ENGAGEMENT.
all RIGHT, SO YOU ARE TRYING
to IMPROVE HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HEATHER BY HAVING SEX WITH HIM?
we DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M PREGNANT.
so TAKE A DAMN TEST.
it's PROBABLY NOTHING, CLAIRE.
and UNTIL YOU KNOW FOR SURE,
you GET TO FEEL LIKE IT COULD BE SOMETHING.
right?
I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP,
but YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
is THERE ANY CHANCE THAT I COULD FINISH MY COFFEE
before YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR MOMENTS?
this IS A TRANSCRIPTOF BEN COOPER'S DEPOSITION FROM 2000
from THE MISSING COURT ARCHIVES.
it WAS LEFT UNDER MY DOOR.
whoever LEFT THE FILE CLEARLY WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.
yesterday D. A. PRATT SAID BEN COOPER GAVE
an EXACT DESCRIPTION OF PAUL GALVAN.
these TRANSCRIPTS MAKE IT CLEAR
that WAS A LIE.
excuse US.
sure.
now YOU NEVER HEARD THIS FROM ME.
when TRACY WELLING WAS MURDERED,
she WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH D. A. PRATT.
and HE DIDN'T RECUSE HIMSELF FROM THE TRIAL?
and YOU KNEW AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?
at THE TIME, I WAS CONVINCED
by THE EVIDENCE AGAINST PAUL GALVAN, BUT...
the OTHER NIGHT WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT
Ben COOPER PLANNED TO RECANT HIS EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY,
I... REMEMBERED HIS EAY DEPOSITION.
which D. A. PRATT TOOK.
if HE SUBORNED PERJURY FROM BEN COOPER THEN,
he'd WANT TO KEEP IT A SECRET NOW.
Pratt HAD A MOTIVE TO KILL BEN COOPER.
I DO NOT THINK THAT I WOULD GO THAT FAR. I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T
because THAT TRIAL MADE YOUR CAREER.
you MOVED INTO TRACY WELLING'S OLD OFFICE
after PAUL GALVAN WAS FOUND GUILTY.
but YOU CAN'T HELP ME TRY TO UNDO THE CASE
and HOPE TO REMAIN UNAFFECTED.
I NEVER CLAIMED TO BE UNAFFECTED.
the REASON I KNEW ABOUT THE AFFAIR
was BECAUSE TRACY WELLING WAS MY FRIEND.
how DO YOU THINK IT FEELS TO SIT AT HER DESK
and WONDER IF WE GOT THE WRONG GUY?
Denise... WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUT
you WON'T BE TELLING ANYONE I WAS YOUR SOURCE ON THIS.
I'm SURE YOUR DOCTOR BOYFRIEND WOULD HATE TO FIND OUT
what HAPPENED LAST MONTH...
with HANSON ON YOUR DESK.
our OFFICE WALLS ARE VERY THIN.
I KNOW YOU'RE A BUSY MAN,
so, UH, IF YOU HAVE TO HEAD OUT AT ANY POINT,
just, YOU KNOW...
anyway, UH, I TALKED TO MY PEOPLE
and EXPLAINED THAT THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM
to GO DIGGING INTO A 7-YEAR-OLD MURDER TRIAL.
good.
I'm SORRY. DO Y'ALL NEED THE ROOM?
Oh, WE WON'T BE LONG.
you SURE? UH, WE CAN HEAD UP TO MY OFFICE.
don't DO IT.
he'll START SHOWING YOU HIS BASEBALL MEMORABIL.
you'll NEVER BE HEARD FROM AGAIN.
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS TALKING ABOUT
unless YOU'RE A FAN OF THE AMAZING A's.
Hey, CAN I GET SOME LEGAL ADVICE TO SETTLE A BET? REALLY NOT THE TIME, LINZ.
he DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THE BET.
I DON'T MIND. GO AHEAD.
okay, I HAVE A WITNESS IN A MURDER CASE.
Yeah.
this WITNESS SAW THE MURDERER,
but HE DOESN'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THE GUY.
is IT OKAY IF I JOG HIS MEMORY A LITTLE?
you KNOW, SUGGEST SPECIFICS TO HIM?
you'd BE GETTING INTO MURKY WATERS THERE,
legally SPEAKING. SEE? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
so IF I FED THE GUY AN EXACT DESCRIPTION
and HAD HIM REPEAT IT BACK TO ME CHAPTER AND VERSE,
that WOULD PRETTY MUCH BE OUT OF THE QUESTION... YEAH.
legally SPEAKING? BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID YOU SHOULD DO.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE, WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? WITNESS TAMPERING.
or--or IS THAT SUBORNING PERJURY?
I'm SURE THE LIEUTENANT WOULD VER SUGGEST
that COURSE OF ACTION. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
he's NOT THE ONE THAT GAVE ME THE IDEA.
I ACTUALLY WAS READING A TRANSCRIPT OF A DEPOSITION
the WITNESS' NAME WAS BEN COOPER.
thank YOU FOR THE COFFEE.
Ben COOPER WAS A WITNESSIN THE MURDER OF D. D.A. TRACY WELLING.
I HEARD A RUMOR THAT YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH HER BACK THEN.
in MY EXPERIENCE, ONCE YOU FIND THE LOVER,
you USUALLY FIND THE KILLER.
if YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS,
I'll INVITE MY LAWYER TO JOIN US.
how LONG DO WE HAVE LEFT?
six HOURS.
I WISH I COULD COMPEL A D. N.A. SAMPLE.
a LOOK AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK WOULD DO.
I BEEN THINKING ABOUT
how OUR JANITOR FOUGHT WITH HIS ATTACKER.
Claire SAID THAT BEN HAD THE KILLER'S BLOOD UNDER FOUR FINGERNAILS ON EACH HAND,
but NOT UNDER HIS THUMBNAILS,
like HE WAS TRYING TO HOLD THE MURDERER OFF.
you KNOW, MAYBE HE GOT HIS HANDS AROUND THE GUY'S NECK.
that's WHERE BEN WOULD'VE SCRATCHED HIS ATTACKER.
I KNOW D. A. PRT.
he WON'T MOVE A MUSCLE TILL HIS LAWYER GETS HERE.
well, HE GOT AWAY WITH MURDER ONCE.
he THINKS HE'S GONNA DO IT AGAIN.
I REALLY SHOULD GO SEE CLAIRE WHILE WE WAIT.
I'll LEAVE YOU TO IT
while I GATHER AFFIDAVITS FOR MY COURT PETITION.
wish ME LUCK.
you AND ME BOTH.
leave THE BAND-AID.
okay, HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING
seven YEARS AGO.
D. A. PRATT COACHED BEN COOPER
and SKEWED HIS EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY
because D. A. PRATT WAS THE REAL KILLER,
and HE WAS FRAMING PAUL GALVAN TO TAKE THE FALL.
Mm-hmm. FLASH FORWARD TO THE PRESENT
Ben COOPER KNOWS
that PAUL GALVAN'S EXECUTION IS ONLY A FEW DAYS AWAY.
he FINALLY DEVELOPS A CONSCIENCE
and WANTS TO RECANT HIS OLD TESTIMONY.
maybe HE ASKS D. A. PRATT ABOUT IT.
Pratt GOES TO SEE HIM, TELLS HIM TO STAY QUIET.
they ARGUE, THEY FIGHT, AND BEN COOPER ENDS UP DEAD.
good THEORY, BUT HARD TO PROVE.
Ben COOPER'S IN THE DRAWER OVER THERE,
and D. A. PRATT AIN'T TALKING.
all RIGHT.
according TO YOUR BLOOD TEST, YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT.
Oh.
what YOU ARE IS ANEMIC.
Oh. OH.
you HAVE A DEFICIENCY OF RED BLOOD CELLS.
that's WHY YOU'VE BEEN FEELING SO RUN-DOWN.
this IS A LIST OF VITAMINS TO GET.
take THE VITAMINS, EAT SOME ACTUAL MEALS...
and YOU'LL BE 100% IN NO TIME.
okay. THANKS.
this IS GOOD NEWS, RIGHT,
not BEING PREGNANT WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND'S BABY?
Yeah. OF--OF COURSE. IT'S GREAT.
I JUST...
thought MAYBE YOU AND TOM WOULD GET A DO-OVER?
no.
maybe.
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT MY LIFE.
this IS NOT EXACTLY MOTHER-OF-THE-YEAR MATERIAL.
you KNOW, MAYBE...
God's JUST TELLING ME I ALREADY HAD MY CHANCE.
he OR SHE...
is TELLING YOU...
not RIGHT NOW, NOT THIS TIME.
that's A LONG, LONG WAY FROM NEVER.
you SHOULD SEE ALL THE PROTESTERS.
they, UH, FILL THE PARKING LOT.
the PRESS IS ALL OVER THIS.
you GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE.
that's NICE TO HEAR.
you, UM, YOU MET MY FRIEND JILL?
she WROTE A LEGAL PETITION FOR YOU.
it's TOO LATE FOR ALL THAT.
we HAVE FOUR HOURS.
I'm JUST GLAD WE GOT A CHANCE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
no, DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
well, IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING
if I TALK DIFFERENT.
you GOT A BAD BREAK, GETTING ME AS A DAD.
that's NOT TRUE.
Yeah, IT IS.
I've BEEN LETTING YOU DOWN YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
and I'M-- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T...
I DIDN'T DO BETTER FOR YOU.
if I CAN SHOW THAT D. A. PRATT KNEW
Ben's TESTIMONY WAS UNRELIABLE,
it'll REALLY HELP MY PETITION TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
is TELL YOU HOW BEN USED TO SELL HIS DRUGS?
exactly LIKE YOU SAID TO THE POLICE YESTERDAY.
I HAVE AN AFFIDAVIT FORM HERE. ALL RIGHT. COME ON IN.
let ME, UH, MOVE THESE OUT OF THE WAY. HEADED OUT OF TOWN?
Yeah, VACATION. I'M LEAVING TONIGHT.
you ALL RIGHT? YOU LOOK A LITTLE
sorry. IT'S BEEN A...
very LONG DAY.
hmm.
all RIGHT, COME ON IN.
come ON IN THE KITCHEN...
and HAVE A SEAT,
and I'LL GET YOU A DRINK.
perfect.
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
but I NEED TO GET MY GLASSES.
you've reached the voice mail of Inspector Lindsay Boxer.
Hey, IT'S JILL.
I'm AT HENRY DOW'S APARTMENT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I CAN STALL HIM.
he's HEADED OUT OF TOWN. YOU NEED TO GET HERE.
I THINK HE'S OUR GUY.
here WE GO.
so I'LL NOTARIZE YOUR SIGNATURE
and FAX IT OVER TO THE COURT.
hang ON.
I NEED YOU TO WALK ME THROUGH THIS STEP-BY-STEP.
I'm WOG, SIR.
so FORMAL.
there's YOUR PROBLEM. YOU NEED TO RELAX.
and I GOT SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU ABOUT THIS AFFIDAVIT BEFORE I SIGN ANYTHING.
or I COULD JUST FORGET THE WHOLE THING
and GET GOING.
all RIGHT.
ask AWAY.
what's HAPPENING TO HIM NOW?
the PRIEST DIPS HIS FINGERS IN OIL,
and THEN HE MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
over YOUR DAD'S EYES, EARS, LIPS, HANDS AND FEET.
and THEN HE ASKS GOD TO FORGIVE YOUR DAD
for ANYTHING HE'S DONE OR DESIRED IN HIS HEART.
and THEN HE ASKS GOD TO RELEASE YOUR DAD
from ALL PAIN OF BODY OR MIND.
well, IF HE'S DEAD, DOESN'T THAT HAPPEN ANYWAY?
that's ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT IT.
witness TAMPERING,
suborning PERJURY, OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
no MATTER WHAT, YOUR CAREER IS OVER. THE QUESTION IS,
how DOES THE REST OF YOUR LIFE PLAY OUT?
we're HERE TO TALK ABOUT A DEAL.
why ISN'T THERE A D. D.A. PRESENT? YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
to DO ONE RIGHT THING IN THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT.
30 MINUTES AND COUNTING. BEN COOPER WAS SCARED.
he WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO COME FORWARD ON HIS OWN.
we THINK SOMEONE SENT HIM TO YOU.
who GAVE YOU BEN COOPER?
you OKAY?
no.
a BRIEF STATEMENT WOULD BE ENOUGH.
it's KINDA TOO LATE FOR THIS, ISN'T IT?
what GOOD CAN I DO AT THIS POINT?
you CAN TELL THE TRUTH.
let ME SEE THAT FORM AGAIN.
easy.
Mr. DOW, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA SIGN THIS,
I REALLY SHOULD GO. NO, I'M GONNA SIGN IT. I PROMISED.
you NEED MY HELP, DON'T YOU?
Hey, YOU NEED MY HELP, DON'T YOU, HUH?
Hey, LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU! HUH? SO GLAD I CAUGHT YOU AT HOME.
D. A. PRATT SAID I SHOULD TALK YOU.
how'd YOU GET THOSE SCRATCHES ON YOUR NECK, HENRY?
Henry DOW, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDERS OF BEN COOPER AND TRACY WELLING.
let's WAKE UP A JUDGE. MY PLEASURE.
confess TO BOTH MURDERS NOW,
and WE'LL TAKE THE DEATH PENALTY OFF THE TABLE.
or YOU COULD WAIT TILL AFTER MIDNIGHT,
and IF PAUL GALVAN DIES, THEN YOU GET THE DEATH PENALTY, TOO.
thank GOD.
arms OUT, PLEASE. AND THEN A FEW DAYS AGO,
you POSTED AN UPDATE ON YOUR WEB PAGE
saying THAT BEN NTED TO RECANT.
and HENRY WENT TO YOUR WEB PAGE ALL THE TIME.
that WAS WHERE HE FIRST HEARD THE NEWS ABOUT BEN.
so IT'S MY FAULT THAT BEN DIED.
no.
no, OF COURSE IT ISN'T.
and IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,
you WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NEXT.
it WAS HENRY WHO SET OFF THAT GAS EXPLOSION IN YOUR APARTMENT.
he FIGURED IF YOU WERE DEAD,
then NO ONE ELSE WOULD STOP THE EXECUTION.
and IT WAS HENRY THAT RAPED AND KILLED TRACY WELLING.
she HAD CALLED HIM AND ASKED HIM TO COME OVER
and FIX HER GARBAGE DISPOSAL.
he CUT HIS HAND IN HER SINK.
when SHE WENT TO GIVE HIM A BAND-AID,
he TRIED TO KISS HER. SHE FOUGIM,
and HE ENDED UP SUFFOCATING HER.
he PANICKED AND RAN.
your FATHER GOT CAUGHT BETWEEN HENRY DOW'S FRAME UP
and D. A. PRATT'S RUSH TO CLOSE THE CASE.
you CANNOT BLAME YOURSELF FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN.
he WAS FOLLOWING HIS CONSCIENCE,
the SAME WAY THAT YOU FOLLOWED YOURS.
you SAVED YOUR FATHES LIFE.
Thanks, JAMIE.
Yeah.
you SHOULD THANK THEM, TOO.
just DOING OUR THING.
no, PLEASE. I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT... FOR YOUR STORY.
Thanks. YOU'RE WELCOME.
you READY?
I THINK JAMIE KIND OF LIKES YOU.
you THINK?
there's A GUY AT THE END OF THE BAR
holding A RIFLE.
so WE MOVE IN, WE'RE YELLING. HE DOESN'T BACK DOWN,
doesn't EVEN LOOK AT US. SO I TAKE HIM FROM THE LEFT,
couple OF OTHER GUYS GO AT HIM FROM THE RIGHT,
and WE REALIZE THE RIFLE IS ATTACHED TO A VIDEO GAME.
guy HAD BEEN PLAYING A GAME THIS WHOLE DAMN TIME.
we ASK HIM WHY HE DIDN'T GIVE UP THE GUN.
he SAYS,"BECAUSE I ALREADY PAID MY 25 CENTS.
the GUY SAYS HE'S JUST ABOUT TO HIT LEVEL TEN...
how MANY SHOOTERS? -Two.
how MANY DOWN? -One. 15-year-old boy.
how BAD? -Not good.
can HE TALK? -They're not optimistic.
all RIGHT, GET WHATEVER YOU CAN. I'M ALMOST THERE.
took ONE IN THE EST SEVEN, EIGHT MINUTES AGO.
he WASN'T CONSCIOUS ENOUGH TO TALK.
please TELL ME WE HAVE A WITNESS.
coming YOUR WAY.
Mr. WILCOX?
this IS MY PARTNER, INSPECTOR LINDSAY BOXER.
tell HER WHAT YOU SAW.
all RIGHT, I COME OUT OF THE CLUB.
I STEP OFF THE CURB.
this WHITE VAN BLOWS RIGHT BY ME.
a WHITE VAN? -YEAH.
he CAME SO CLOSE TO ME, HE COULD'VE HIT ME.
he PULLS UP. HE PARKS.
then A DIFFERENT CAR BLOWS PAST HIM,
pulls UP, PARKS RIGHT OVER THERE.
a GUY IN A RED HOODIE JUMPS OUT, STARTS FIRING AWAY.
the--the GUY IN THE RED HOODIE,
he WAS OUT OF HIS CAR WHEN HE WAS FIRING?
Yeah, AND THE GUY IN THE VAN STARTS FIRING BACK.
I DIDN'T SEE THE KID IN THE MIDDLE TILL HE GOT HIT.
is THAT BOY GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
he's ALIVE. DID YOU SEE EITHER OF THE SHOOTERS?
Yeah, THE GUY IN THE RED HOODIE,
I GOT A REAL GOOD LOOK AT HIM
white GUY, MAYBE 30.
now MR. WILCOX DIDN'T SEE THE CAR ACROSS THE STREET
or THE MAKE OF THE VAN, BUT THE VAN HAD A PORTHOLE,
driver's SIDE.
this MAN IN THE RED SWEATSHIRT
we'd LIKE YOU TO SIT DOWN WITH A SKETCH ARTIST AND DESCRIBE HIM.
this OFFICER HERE WILL ARRANGE IT. -YEAH, OF COURSE.
Cindy THOMAS, SAN FRANCISCO REGISTER.
I AM A FRIEND OF INSPECTOR-- LINDSAY!
she's ALL RIGHT, OFFICER.
Hey, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
thought YOU WERE READING "EAT PRAY LOVE."
thought YOU WERE WATCHING "ATONEMENT."
so I HEAR IT WAS A DRIVE-BY TURNED SHOOTOUT.
any IDEAS?
crazy WILD HUNCH-- DRUG DEALERS.
Hey. HEY. 9-1-1 JUST TOOK A CALL
a WHITE VAN WITH A PORTHOLE WEAVING DOWN GEORGIA
and 4th DINGED A COUPLE CARS.
the GUY CAN BARELY DRIVE.
he MUST HAVE BEEN HIT.
you WILL NOT EVEN NOTICE ME IN THE BACKSEAT.
okay, FINE. SHEESH!
he's STILL IN THE CAR.
he MUST BE HIT BAD. HE'S BARELY MOVING.
police! DROP YOUR WEAPON!
I'm GOING IN! CALL FOR BACKUP!
I'll TAKE THE OTHER SIDE.
5-HENRY-15, I NEED A 4-0-8
and FIRE TO ROLL MY LOCATION, CODE 3!
don't TURN AROUND, OR I WILL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF.
toss THE 9.
I'm NOT GIVING UP MY GUN.
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU, BUT IF IT MEANS ME
getting OUT OF HERE ALIVE, I'LL DO IT.
Barney, BARNEY, BARNEY.
tell YOUR CLNT HE'LL TAKE FIVE TO TEN FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT,
or I'LL GET A JURY TO PUT HIM AWAY FOR 20 ON ATTEMPTED HOMICID
you're A DOL BYE.
how WAS LAST NIGHT?
last NIGHT WAS, UH...
last NIGHT WAS GOOD-LOOKING, SMART AND HAS GREAT ABS.
I MEAN SIX-PACK, NOT JUST THE TOP TWO.
have I MENTIONED SINGLE LIFE IS FABULOUS?
and HOW'D YOU MEET THIS ONE?
saw HIM ON THE TREADMILL. WOOF.
only ONE PROBLEM. -WHAT, ONLY ONE?
Claire's GUEST ROOM IS NOT THE PLACE FOR LATE-NIGHT SCREAMS OF PASSION.
screams?
a FRIEND AT MERCY TELLS ME THE KID SHOT LAST NIGHT PULLED THROUGH.
Yeah, HE'S OUT OF I. C.U.
but HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
this ONE, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS NOT SO LUCKY.
chief MEDICAL EXAMINER CAME IN TO LOOK,
said THIS IS WHY HE LIKED BEING BEHIND A DESK
and HAD DEPUTIES LIKE ME.
we MIGHT GET AN I. D. ON HIM.
I MANAGED A PARTIAL THUMBPRINT.
pretty GOOD ONE.
what? HE BARELY HAS A HAND.
just ENOUGH SKIN LEFT, THOUGH.
did YOU SEND THE PRINT TO QUANTICO?
and S.F.P.D. LIKE EVERY OTHER TIME I'VE GOTTEN PRINTS.
I TOOK THESE OUT OF HIM.
one OF 'EM BLEW HIS HEART APART.
what KIND OF BULLET IS THAT?
very CHICHI-- INCENDIARY. 308.
in ENGLISH, THAT WOULD BE?
it HITS YOUR GAS TANK--BOOM.
that's PROBABLY AN ANSWER TO MY PARTIAL PRINT.
I ESS OUR JOHN DOE HERE IS IN THE SYSTEM.
he's NOT A DRUG DEALER.
his NAME IS STEVEN RUSSO...
and HE'S A COP.
steven RUSSO--HE WAS ONE OF OURS, UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS.
and HE WASN'T JUST KILLED, HE WAS BURNED ALIVE.
we're GONNA FIND WHO DID THIS AND LET THEM KNOW
what IT MEANS WHEN THEY KILL A COP.
boxer AND JACOBI ARE LEAD INSPECTORS.
okay, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.
the WHITE VAN WAS OURS.
it WAS HIS UNDERCOVER VEHICLE.
what WE DON'T KNOW IS IF HE WAS KILLED BECAUSE HE WAS A COP.
the MESSAGE, PEOPLE, DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING.
all RIGHT, MITCHELL'S TEAM, YOU TAKE STREET SOURCES.
Miller's TEAM, TAKE CENTRAL RECORDS.
I'm LIAISON TO NARCOTICS.
let's GO.
do WE KNOW WHAT RUSSO WAS DOING UNDERCOVER?
nothing YET.
okay, WHY THE STONEWALL FROM NARCOTICS?
it's MESSY. ONE OF THEIR GUYS IS DOWN.
I'd ACT THE SAME WAY.
boxer, JACOBI, THEY NEED YOU IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM.
Oh, HEY, HEY, LINZ, UH, LOOK, SINCE KISS ME NOT KILLER HAS BEEN QUIET
for FOUR MONTHS NOW, THE FEDS NO LONGER CONSIDER YOU A TARGET.
throw A PARTY.
no MORE FBI AGENTS IN YOUR REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
they DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE HE'S DONE.
maybe WE CAUGHT A BREAK HERE.
don't BET ON IT, TOM. THEY NEVER QUIT.
I WANT TO TALK TO RUSSO'S WIFE.
no. NARCOTICS HASN'T NOTIFIED HER YET.
he WAS UNDERCOVER. IT'S AN ONGOING OPERATION.
do YOU HAVE ANY LEADS AT ALL?
you KNOW, THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
there's SOMETHING I DON'T GET.
this GUY IN THE RED HOOD,
thone THAT BLEW UP RUSSO'S VAN--HE GOT THE DROP ON ME.
he HAD AN ASSAULT RIFLE INCHES FROM MY HEAD.
he'd ALREADY KILLED ANOTHER PERSON.
so WHY DIDN'T HE SHOOT ME, YOU KNOW?
why LET ME LIVE?
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
if SOME GUY HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD,
I'd BE A TOTAL MESS... UNLESS IT WAS HIM.
you're DROOLING.
you're NOT? -NO.
just OBSERVING.
three COFFEES, LIGHT.
who's THAT?
we DON'T KNOW, BUT LINDSAY LIKES HIM.
grow UP.
wow, HE LIKES YOU.
right NOW HE'S DNG A CLASSIC TAKE-A-SECOND-LOOK FAKE PHONE CALL.
he'll TURN THIS WAY IN FIVE SECONDS.
that's RIDICULOUS.
okay, NOT TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.
go TALK TO HIM, AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, FORGET TOM.
Oh, GOD, THAT'S... OVER.
I MEAN, OFFICIALLY, IT'S OVER.
and--and I AM READY TO--TO GET BACK OUT THERE.
I'm JUST NOT A MAKE- THE-FIRST-MOVE KIND OF GIRL.
so CLAIRE SAID THAT THE WHITE VAN
was BLOWN UP USING INCENDIARY BULLETS.
can I USE THAT? -SURE.
do WE HAVE ANYTHING ON THE VICTIM--NAME, AGE, ANYTHING?
still WORKING ON IT.
all RIGHT, WELL, KEEP ME POSTED.
why DID WE JUST LIE TO HER?
why DIDN'T WE TELL HER THE VICTIM'S A COP?
undercover COP.
well, I HEAR TOM TALKED TO NARCO AGAIN.
they WON'T LET US TALK TO RUSSO'S WIFE.
we're STILL GETTING A STONEWALL FROM NARCOTICS?
she DESERVES TO KNOW HER HUSBAND IS DEAD.
let's PRETEND WE DIDN'T GET THAT MESSAGE AND GO SEE HER ANYWAY.
I BEGGED HIM TO QUIT.
anything BUT UNDERCOVER.
he--he WAS A DEDICATED COP.
he SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO US!
mom? MOM?
Nicky WON'T GIVE ME THE REMOTE. -ALL RIGHT.
Hey, GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME YOUR ROOM? -OKAY, COME ON!
do YOU KNOW IF STEVE WAS ON ASSIGNMENT?
I ONLY SAW HIM TWO OR THREE NIGHTS A WEEK.
you KNOW HOW IT IS.
they HAVE TO AVOID BEING FOLLOWED.
when WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?
monday NIGHT.
you MARRIED, INSPECTOR?
uh, NO.
well, A WIFE ALWAYS KNOWS, AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN,
even BEFORE HE TOLD ME.
what DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN HE WANTED OUT...
and I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET HIM GO BACK.
this WAS YESTERDAY.
Hey, it's me.
I got a minute.
I just wanted to say you were
things are crazy out here-- really strange.
it's goin' bad.
so listen, I'm gonna make them bring me in, and I'm never goin' out again. I love you.
Hey, KID.
you COULD SAY "DAD.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WOULD HAVE PHONED, BUT...
you DON'T TAKE MY CALLS.
it's BEEN WHAT, SIX YEARS? -SEVEN.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COUNTING.
when YOU GOT THROWN OFF THE FORCE,
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR LIFE.
you CROSSED THE LINE, TALKING TO THE WIDOW.
I STILL HAVE A FEW FRIENDS IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO TALK TO ME.
watch OUT, KID.
people SEE YOU BENDING THE RULES, AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY.
me, BENDING THE RULES?
sorry. I DON'T NEED CAREER ADVICE FROM A DIRTY EX-COP.
don't GO EASY ON ME JUST 'CAUSE I'M YOUR OLD MAN.
right, I FORGOT. IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.
Marty, IT'S MY JOB. IT'S MY CASE. IT'S MY LI.
stay AWAY.
your SOURCES IN THE HOMICIDE BUREAU
they SAID THEY COULDN'T I. D. THE VICTIM IN THAT EXPLOSION?
that's WHAT THEY SAID.
my SOURCES SAY THE BODY IN THE VAN WAS AN UNDERCOVER COP.
narcotics FLIPPED OUT WHEN ASKED FOR COMMENT.
I'll... UH, I'-- I'LL LOOK INTO IT.
undercover COP SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
if WE WAIT TOO LONG TO GO WITH IT,
the "CHRONICLE" WILL HAVE IT FIRST.
we're GOING WITH SCOTT'S STORY.
how's MR. WILCOX DOING ON OUR MAN IN THE RED HOOD?
in YOUR COMPUTER IN TEN MINUTES.
Thanks.
Hey, LINZ. THE "REGISTER" HAS ATORY UP
unnamed UNDERCOVER COP KILLED.
every RELATIVE OF EVERY UNDERCOVER COP WITHIN 100 MILES
is CALLING TO SEE IF THEIR LOVED ONE DIED IN THAT VAN.
have WE HEARD FROM NARCOTICS YET?
zip, NADA, NOTHING. -OKAY.
any RELATIVE THAT CALLS NEEDS TO BE INTERVIEWED BY AN INSPECTOR,
and ANYTHING INTERTING COMES STRAIGHT TO US.
you ALL KNEW THE VICTIM WAS A COP, AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.
when AN OFFICER GETS KILLED, PEOPLE GET SCARED.
we HADN'T EVEN NOTIFIED THE WIFE YET.
don't YOU THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE HELD THE STORY?
what, SUDDENLY YOU DON'T TRUST ME?
Cindy, WE ABSOLUTELY TRUST YOU.
funny WAY OF SHOWING IT.
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE IN THIS TOGETHER.
I've... -COFFEE LIGHT.
I JUST--I DON'T USUALLY DO THIS.
I-I LEFT MY MONEY IN MY WALLET.
don't EVEN SWEAT IT.
just PAY ME LATER. -THANK YOU.
sorry.
you SEEM... -ANNOYED AND FRUSTRATED?
no, I WAS GONNA SAY U SEEM TO LIKE COFFE. -I'M PETE. PETE RAYNOR. -HI. LINDSAY BOXER.
Hi. -HI.
I've BEEN FIENDING FOR A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN FOR HOURS.
you DON'T LOOK BLUEBERRY.
what DO I LOOK LIKE?
more... SCONE.
know SOMETHING, LINDSAY BOXER? YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.
tha-- THA-THAT'S QUITE A JUMP FROM SCONES.
we CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO PASTRY. NO, NO, NO. UH, IT'S...
thank YOU.
sorry.
well, I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK. -YEAH, OF COURSE.
I MEAN, I-I WILL, TOO. -ALL RIGHT.
okay. -EXCUSE ME.
um, I'LL STAY. LOOK... OKAY.
you KNOW, WE ALL GET FRUSTRATED AND ANNOYED SOMETIMES.
sure, OKAY, LINDSAY. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
you CONNECT WITH HIM, BUT HE DOESN'T ASK FOR YOUR PHONE NUMBER.
I'm SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION.
right. -RIGHT.
Yep, NO PROBLEM.
Sutton JUST INTERVIEWED A RELATIVE WHO CAME IN,
says WE SHOULD TALK TO HER. SHE IS ON HER WAY UP.
what?
nothing. -COME ON.
no, IT'S STUPID.
okay, WHAT WOULD PROMPT YOU, A GUY WHO THINKS A WOMAN IS "VERY PRETTY, TO NOT ASK FOR HER PHONE NUMBER? TOTALLY HYTHETICAL.
you're RIGHT. IT'S STUPID.
told YOU. -MAYBE I'M MARRIED.
no RING. -I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
walks LIKE A SINGLE GUY. -GAY.
I'd KNOW. -THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO.
I'm POSITIVE.
inspector BOXER?
sandy FOSTER. I WAS TOLD TO SEE YOU.
right, YEAH. UH, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.
this IS INSPECTOR JACOBI.
Hi. -HI.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A RELATIVE WHO'S UNDERCOVER?
Yeah, ANDY McCARTHY. HE'S IN NARCOTICS.
look, I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF HE'S THE COP THAT WAS KILLED.
be-- MRS. FOSTER, THE MAN WHO WAS KILLED ISN'T NAMED ANDY McCARTHY.
Oh, MY GOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
the--the PROBLEM IS--IS WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TODAY.
he ALWAYS CALLS ME WEDNESDAY MORNINGS.
so, I MEAN, OUR--OUR DAD IS IN THE HOSPITAL,
so HE CALLS FOR UPDATES AND
you're SURE IT WASN'T HIM IN THAT VAN? IT WASN'T HIM.
okay.
anyway, I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO WORK. -THANK YOU.
Andy McCARTHY. UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS? JUST LIKE RUSSO.
undercover NARCOTICS. McCARTHY.
Oh, MY GOD.
does ANDY McCARTHY LOOK LIKE THE GUY THAT BLEW UP THAT VAN?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW THIS.
inspector ANDY McCARTHY KILLED INSPECTOR STEVE RUSSO.
one UNDERCOVER COP KILLING ANOTHER, WHY?
I CAN THINK OF A FEW REASONS. I DON'T LIKE ANY OF 'EM.
Lindsay, WARREN-- BILL SCHROEDER, NARCOTICS.
I UNDERSTAND YOU THINK ONE OF MY INSPECTORS HAS GONE BAD.
well, CAPTAIN, IT LOOKS THAT WAY.
we HAVE A WITNESS SKETCH OF THE MAN THAT BLEW UP STEVE RUSSO'S VAN. IT'S ANDY McCARTHY.
so ANDY McCARTHY, TEN YEARS WITH THE DEPARTMEN HAS STARTED WORKING
for DRUG DEALERS AND KILLING OTHER COPS?
I DON'T BUY IT.
it's HIM IN THE SKETCH, AND HE DID BLOW UP RUSSO'S VAN.
what OTHER EXPLANATION WOULD YOU SUGGEST?
there's AN OLD EXPRESSION-- WHEN YOU HEAR HOOFBEATS IN THE FOREST,
you LOOK FOR A HORSE, NOT A ZEBRA.
steve RUSSO WAS POSING AS A DRUG DEALER.
it WAS PROBABLY ANOTHER DRUG DEALER THAT KILLED HIM.
I DISAGREE, AND WE NEED TO QUESTION McCARTHY.
not WHILE HE'S ON THE STREET.
we're DONE HERE.
were McCARTHY AND RUSSO WORKING A CASE TOGETHER?
Yes.
just THE TWO OF THEM?
one OTHER OFFICER-- HENRY KRAFT.
you WANT TO TELL ME HE'S DIRTY, TOO?
well, ACTUALLY, SIR, NO,
I WOULDN'T BET ON TWO COPS GOING BAD AT THE SAME TIME.
kraft COULD BE IN DANGER.
if McCARTHY'S KILLED ONE OF HIS PARTNERS,
we SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHER ONE.
captain, PULL KRAFT OFF THE STREET.
I DON'T NEED ADVICE ON HOW TO RUN MY UNIT.
if KRAFT DIES, IT'S ON YOU.
stay AWAY FROM McCARTHY, KRAFT, THEIR FAMILIES... AND ME.
get HER IN LINE, OR I GO TO THE CHIEF.
you GO AFTER A CAPTAIN LIKE THAT, LINDSAY?
he's GOT A DIRTY COP IN HIS UNIT, AND HE WON'T ACCEPT THE TRUTH.
you KNOW WHAT? IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,
I'll HAVE NO CHOICE.
I'll HAVE TO TAKE YOU OFF THIS CASE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, -BUT I HEAR YOUR DAD DROPPED BY THIS MORNING. -DON'T DO THIS.
come ON, WE WERE MARRIED WHEN THEY GOT YOUR DAD.
I WATCHED YOU GO THROUGH IT.
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS.
this ISN'T ABOUT MY DAD.
we BOTH KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVE.
what I THINK ABOUT ANDY McCARTHY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FATHER.
they're BOTH DIRTY COPS.
if I WAS YOUR PRIEST, I'D SAY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION.
well, I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT MY PRIEST.
Hey, LINZ.
ed, YOU LOOK GOOD. -WELL, YOU KNOW, I TRY.
but SHE'S ALL YOURS.
I GOT A YOUNG COP WAITING TO BE TOLD HIS LIFE ISN'T OVER JUST 'CAUSE HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.
see YOU AT HOME? -ALL RIGHT. BYE, BABY.
see YOU. -SEE YOU LATER.
I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. -YEAH?
Tom SAYS I'M GOING AFTER THIS DIRTY COP SO AGGRESSIVELY BECAUSE OF MY FATHER.
he's CRAZY, RIGHT? -MAYBE.
and MAYBE HE HAS A POINT.
maybe YOU'RE BOTH CRAZY.
fine, I'LL SHUT UP.
what's THE MATTER?
sorry.
just WORKING SOME THINGS OUT.
what, IS THIS ABOUT JILL SAYING YOU GUYS
are CRAMPING HER STYLE AGAIN?
no, SHE HASN'T MENTIONED THAT IN A WHILE.
it's ED. IT'S NOT WORKING.
it?
I KNEW THERE WAS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT THE PARALYSIS WOULD GET WORSE,
and ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS WOULD BE DOWN THE, YOU KNOW.
your CASE LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU HELPED THAT DTOR'S DAUGHTER?
I TRIED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER, BUT THERE'S A 6-MONTH WAIT.
maybe YOU CAN PULL SOME STRINGS?
sure. -THANKS.
how LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON?
almost THREE MONTHS, AND HONESTLY, I AM GOING OUT OF MY MIND.
I WILL CALL HER TODAY. -THANK YOU.
and I HEARD ABOUT YOUR HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION.
he FLIRTED, I FLIRTED, AND NOTHING.
maybe HE'S SHY.
I'd SAY HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF SHY.
maybe HE'S GAY. -I'D KNOW.
I'm POSITIVE. I'M POSITIVE!
I'll SEE YOU AFTER LUNCH.
they're PREPPING ME FOR MY GRAND JURY TESTIMONY ON THAT DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN THE MISSION.
Yeah, GRAND JURY...
I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIND HENRY KRAFT.
if YOU'RE SUGGESTING WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SUGGESTING,
the ANSWER IS NO.
these THREE COPS WERE MAKING CASES A LONG TIME UNDERCOVER.
they MUST HAVE GIVEN CONFIDENTIAL GRAND JURY TESTIMONY.
Linz, NO.
if I CAN SEE THEIR TESTIMONY,
I CAN FIND OUT WHERE THEY WORKED AND WHERE THEY HUNG OUT,
and THEN I CAN FIND HENRY KRAFT.
you're TALKING ABOUT SEALED DOCUMENTS-- THEIR TESTIMONY, -THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S NOTES. -I KNOW.
I DO THIS-- SOMEONE FINDS OUT,
the LEAST--I LOSE MY JOB.
I COULD BE DISBARRED.
narcotics WON'T GIVE ME ANYTHING. COME ON, JILL.
I'm TELLING YOU, THIS COP IS IN TROUBLE.
I NEED SOMETHING BESIDES YOUR HUNCH.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.
you're NOT GONNA HELP ME?
this ISN'T ABOUT YOU, JUST LIKE IT WASN'T ABOUT CINDY.
we're FRIENDS, BUT WE ALL HAVE JOBS TO DO.
I'd LIKE TO KEEP MINE. -OKAY.
I'M-A FIND ANDY McCARTHY, AND I'M-A FIND HENRY KRAFT.
and IF YOU DON'T HELP ME, I'M-A FIND A WAY.
they SAID THE FBI WAS FINISHED KEEPING AN EYE ON ME.
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN, BUT YOU'RE WASTING THE XPAYERS' MONEY.
I'm NOT A FED, INSPECTOR,
and YOU SHOULD STOP TELLING STORIES ABOUT ANDY McCARTHY BEING DIRTY.
what IS YOUR NAME, OFFICER?
look, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH ANDY McCARTHY'S CHECKING,
his SAVINGS, CREDIT CARDS.
he IS LIVING ON HIS SALARY, LINZ.
nothing HERE SAYS HE'S ON A DRUG DEALER'S PAYROLL. NOTHING.
I'm BUYING.
if HE'S NOT ON A DEALER'S PAYROLL, WHY'D HE KILL A COP?
coffee LIGHTS, UH, MOCHA SUPREMO WITH EXTRA CARAMEL.
Jacobi's HOOKED ON SUGAR. -YEAH.
uh, THERE WAS A GUY HERE YESTERDAY.
Oh, YEAH, MR. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.
Yeah. UH... OH,
uh, KAY, UH, NONFAT LATTE, DOUBLE SHOT.
he WOR IN THAT OFFICE BUILDING.
next TIME HE PASSES BY,
do YOU WANT ME TO MENTION YOU WERE ASKING?
Yeah. -YEAH?
no. -NO?
no. -NO?
thank YOU.
I'll DRINK JACOBI'S MOCHA. LET'S WALK.
I GOTTA TELL YA, EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE A LITTLE OVERINVESTED
in THIS BECAUSE OF YOUR DAD.
I AM TRYING TO SAVE A COP'S LIFE, OKAY?
this HAS NOTHING TO DO WITHE OR MY DAD.
Linz, WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BEING MARTIN BOXER'S DAUGHTER
the LOOKS, THE WHISPERS, LIVING WITH IT YOUR WHOLE CAREER.
if I SAY YOU'RE RIGHT, WILL YOU GIVE ME THE GRAND JURY NOTES?
anyone FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS, I COULD END UP DOING TIME,
and I DON'T THINK I'D ENJOY THE FOOD IN PRISON.
read IT AND BURN IT.
before McCARTHY KILLED STEVE RUSSO,
they WORKED A COUPLE OF CASES TOGETHER.
the THIRD COP--HENRY KRAFT
was PART OF THOSE OPERATIONS, TOO.
this WILL TELL YOU WHO THEY TALKED TO AND WHERE THEY GO.
officer HENRY KRAFT?
you WANT SOMEBODY ELSE.
I'm INSPECTOR BOXER.
this IS INSPECTOR JACOBI. WE NEED TO TALK.
I DON'T NEED TO TALK TO NOBODY.
one OF YOUR GUYS-- McCARTHY--TURNED.
you HEARD ABOUT STEVE RUSSO?
McCarthy KILLED HIM.
not A CHANCE. I KNOW McCARTHY.
we THINK McCARTHY'S AFTER YOU NOW.
I'm UNDERCOVER.
I'm GONNA STAY UNDER UNTIL I GET CALLED IN.
now THE ONLY ONES LOOKING TO GET ME KILLED ARE YOU.
we GOTTA TAKE HIM IN.
mccarthy, DON'T DO IT!
come ON, MAN. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE COPASETIC.
come ON, BABY, PUT THE GUN DOWN.
come ON, McCARTHY.
come ON, ANDY.
put IT DOWN. JUST PUT IT DOWN.
that's IT.
Where's McCARTHY?
he's MY GUY, SO I'LL DO THE INTERVIEW.
captain... -NOT ANOTHER WORD.
you WENT AFTER HIM IN DIRECT DEFIANCE OF MY ORDERS.
bill, IT'S BOXER'S CASE. -STEP BACK, TOM.
boxer IS THE REASON THAT HENRY KRAFT
is IN THE HOSPITAL, NOT IN THE MORGUE.
you've BEEN BLOCKING US EVERY STEP OF THE WA AND I GET IT
you GOT A BAD COP, YOU WANT TO CLEAN YOUR OWN HOUSE,
it STOPS HERE, OR I GO TO I. A.
I'm WATCHING.
Hi, ANDY.
Andy, WE NEED TO TALK.
I HAVE TO GO.
I CAN'T BE HERE.
you WANT TO TELL ME WHY YOU SHOT HENRY KRAFT?
you COULD HAVE SHOT ME, BUT YOU DIDN'T. WHY IS THAT?
man, I HAVE TO GO.
I CANNOT BE HERE.
I CAN'T BE HERE!
tell ME ABOUT THE WATCH.
RAMOS... HE GAVE IT TO ME.
Salvadorian DRUG LORD.
they DO THAT.
they BUY YOU THINGS AND TREAT YOU LIKE A-A FRIEND.
but YOU'RE NOT.
RAM-- BUT RAMOS, MAN, HE SAW RIGHT THRGH ME.
Ramos MADE YOU?
he FIGURED OUT I WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER.
and THEN THEY... THEY... THEY PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD.
they MADE ME TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
they TOLD ME I HAD TO KILL RUSSO AND KRAFT.
Andy, WHY DIDN'T YOU COME IN AND TELL US?
because... THEY FOUND OUT WHERE I LIVE.
Oh, GOD.
they're IN MY HOME.
they HAVE MY WIFE AND MY SON.
I DIDN'T WANT TO KILL ANYONE.
I HAD TO.
they HAVE MY FAMILY.
they HAVE MY FAMILY.
okay. OKAY.
the HOSTAGES ARE A WOMAN AND HER 10-YEAR-OLD SON.
there ARE TWO CAPTORS.
I WANT NO POLICE PRESENCE WITHIN SIGHT OF THAT HOUSE.
these GUYS SEE ANY SIGN OF LICE, THEY'LL KILL THE HOSTAGES.
I GOT IT, LIEUTENANT.
no UNIFORMS, NO SECTOR CARS.
my MEN KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.
judge ANDERSON ISSUED WARRANTS
to COVER ENTRY AND SURVEILLANCE.
you WOULDN'T THINK WE'D NEED WARRANTS TO SAVE TWO PEOPLE'S LIVES, RIGHT?
which IS WHY YOU CARRY THE GUN, AND I SEE THE JUDGE.
good LUCK.
Hey, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE. WHAT'S UP?
I'm SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT RUSSO.
it's OKAY.
what's WITH THE BODY ARMOR?
frankly, IT'S A LITTLE BULKY ON YOU.
we GOT TWO HOSTAGES, AND WE'RE GONNA GO GET 'EM.
it's YOUR EXCLUSIVE IF YOU WANT TO WATCH.
wait, IF YOU'RE DOING THIS JUSTECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY,
I WANT TO SAY, AWESOME!
Lindsay, SHE SIGNS A LIABILITY RELEASE.

the GUY IN THE HOUSE WANTS TO KNOW IF IT'S TIME TO SHUT IT DOWN.
the CALLER THINKS, BUT WANTS TO CONFIRM.

I SAID FORGET IT.
you're A CIVILIAN. IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.
narcotics USED CIVILIAN DECOYS IN A STRING OF BUSTS IN THE HAIGHT LAST YEAR.

congratulations ON SAVING THE COP'S FAMILY.
I'm PROUD OF YOU, HON.

I REMEMBER WALKING YOU DOWN THE AISLE
and SNEAKING YOU THAT SLICE OF PIZZA AT THE RECEPTION.
and LOOK HOW ALL THAT TURNED OUT.
good-bye, MARTY.
how DID YOU FIND HENRY KRAFT?
you PULLED OFF A MIRACLE, AND PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW.
they DON'T LIKE YOU FOR IT, LINDSAY.
they SEE YOU CRACKING THESE IMPOSSIBLE CASES,
and THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
what HAVE YOU GOT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS?
who's ASKING--SCHROEDER? -NOT JUST HIM.
so THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE
to TELL ME THAT PEOPLE ARE PISSED OFF BECAUSE I'M A GOOD COP.
no, I'M HERE TO WARN YOU NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.
I WONT BE TAKING PAPER BAGS FULL OF $50s FROM DOMINIC BUCCI,
if THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
is THAT WHAT YOU THINK I DID?
it's WHAT THE COURT SAYS YOU DID.
if A CASE LIKE THIS TEACHES YOU ANYTHING,
it's THAT THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR.
I'm STILL YOUR FATHER, LIKE IT OR NOT.
see YOU AROUND, LINDSAY.
Hey. -HI.
how MUCH DID YOU HEAR?
didn't HEAR A THIN
we've BEEN, COLLECTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF
why AN ELIGIBLE MAN WOULDN'T ASK A SMART, FUNNY,
strong, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FOR HER PHONE NUMBER.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
And?
it's THE GUN.
the GUN? -SCARED HIM OFF.
I WASN'T CARRYING A GUN.
Oh, BUT HE COULD SENSE THE GUN. -YEAH.
face IT, LINZ, SOME WOMEN ARE ALWAYS CARRYING THEIR GUN,
even WHEN THEY'RE NOT.
sweetie, WE LOVE HAVING YOU AS A HOUSEGUEST,
but WE'RE CRAMPING YOUR STYLE.
actually, I THINK I'M CRAMPING YOURS.
guess OUR WALLS ARE PRETTY THIN, HUH?
how MUCH HAVE YOU HEARD? -A LOT.
all RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MARRIAGE, CLAIRE, EXCEPT THEBVIOUS,
which IS CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE,
not JUST ONE.
come HERE.
great JOB TODAY.
and I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT UP YOUR FATHER.
it WASN'T ABOUT HIM.
night.
look, IF YOU THINK THIS DOCTOR FRIENDF LINDSAY'S CAN HELP
no, I DON'T.
what?
you DON'T NEED A DOCTOR, ED. we do
someone THAT WE CAN TALK TO ABOUT
what's BEEN GOING ON...
with BOTH OF US.
Lindsay BOXE -I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
me FIRST. HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
I'm A DETECTIVE. -YEAH, I HEARD.
the KID AT THE COFFEE CART.
I TOLD HIM NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.
your QUESTION? -RIGHT. MY QUESTION IS...
why DOES A MAN HAVE A NICE CONVERSATION WITH A WOMAN THAT HE THINKS IS PRETTY,
and THEN DOESN'T ASK FOR HER NUMBER?
maybe THE MAN THOUGHT ABOUT ASKING FOR HER NUMBER.
W HARD DID HE THINK ABOUT ASKING?
it OCCUPIED HIS WHOLE AFTERNOON,
including A NUMBER OF CALLS TO FRIENDS FOR ADVICE.
but THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE'S ONLY IN TOWN FOR TWO WEEKS.
where ARE YOU GOING? -CAMBODIA. I BUILD HOTELS.
I'm THERE FOR A YEAR.
so YOU THINK IN TWO WEEKS I'LL GET ATTACHED,
and THEN YOU'LL BREAK MY HEART?
no, LINDSAY, I THINK IN TWO WEEKS, LEAVING MIGHT BREAK MINE.
still, I WAS, UM... I WAS ABOUT TO COME FIND YOU.
are YOU-- ARE YOU A GOOD DETECTIVE?
well, I'M--I'M BETTER AT MY JOB THAN I AM AT THIS.
well, THEN, DETECTIVE, WHO ARE THOSE FLOWERS FOR?
I-I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION.
to LINDSAY.
you WANT TO GET SOMETHINGO EAT? -YEAH.
n't FORGET THE FLOWERS. -OKAY.
how MANY SHOOTERS? -Two.
how MANY DOWN? -One. 15-year-old boy.
how BAD? -Not good.
can HE TALK? -They're not optimistic.
all RIGHT, GET WHATEVER YOU CAN. I'M ALMOST THERE.
took ONE IN THE EST SEVEN, EIGHT MINUTES AGO.
he WASN'T CONSCIOUS ENOUGH TO TALK.
please TELL ME WE HAVE A WITNESS.
coming YOUR WAY.
Mr. WILCOX?
this IS MY PARTNER, INSPECTOR LINDSAY BOXER.
tell HER WHAT YOU SAW.
all RIGHT, I COME OUT OF THE CLUB.
I STEP OFF THE CURB.
this WHITE VAN BLOWS RIGHT BY ME.
a WHITE VAN? -YEAH.
he CAME SO CLOSE TO ME, HE COULD'VE HIT ME.
he PULLS UP. HE PARKS.
then A DIFFERENT CAR BLOWS PAST HIM,
pulls UP, PARKS RIGHT OVER THERE.
a GUY IN A RED HOODIE JUMPS OUT, STARTS FIRING AWAY.
the--the GUY IN THE RED HOODIE,
he WAS OUT OF HIS CAR WHEN HE WAS FIRING?
Yeah, AND THE GUY IN THE VAN STARTS FIRING BACK.
I DIDN'T SEE THE KID IN THE MIDDLE TILL HE GOT HIT.
is THAT BOY GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
he's ALIVE. DID YOU SEE EITHER OF THE SHOOTERS?
Yeah, THE GUY IN THE RED HOODIE,
I GOT A REAL GOOD LOOK AT HIM
white GUY, MAYBE 30.
now MR. WILCOX DIDN'T SEE THE CAR ACROSS THE STREET
or THE MAKE OF THE VAN, BUT THE VAN HAD A PORTHOLE,
driver's SIDE.
this MAN IN THE RED SWEATSHIRT
we'd LIKE YOU TO SIT DOWN WITH A SKETCH ARTIST AND DESCRIBE HIM.
this OFFICER HERE WILL ARRANGE IT. -YEAH, OF COURSE.
Cindy THOMAS, SAN FRANCISCO REGISTER.
I AM A FRIEND OF INSPECTOR-- LINDSAY!
she's ALL RIGHT, OFFICER.
Hey, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
thought YOU WERE READING "EAT PRAY LOVE."
thought YOU WERE WATCHING "ATONEMENT."
so I HEAR IT WAS A DRIVE-BY TURNED SHOOTOUT.
any IDEAS?
crazy WILD HUNCH-- DRUG DEALERS.
Hey. HEY. 9-1-1 JUST TOOK A CALL
a WHITE VAN WITH A PORTHOLE WEAVING DOWN GEORGIA
and 4th DINGED A COUPLE CARS.
the GUY CAN BARELY DRIVE.
he MUST HAVE BEEN HIT.
you WILL NOT EVEN NOTICE ME IN THE BACKSEAT.
okay, FINE. SHEESH!
he's STILL IN THE CAR.
he MUST BE HIT BAD. HE'S BARELY MOVING.
police! DROP YOUR WEAPON!
I'm GOING IN! CALL FOR BACKUP!
I'll TAKE THE OTHER SIDE.
5-HENRY-15, I NEED A 4-0-8
and FIRE TO ROLL MY LOCATION, CODE 3!
don't TURN AROUND, OR I WILL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF.
toss THE 9.
I'm NOT GIVING UP MY GUN.
I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOU, BUT IF IT MEANS ME
getting OUT OF HERE ALIVE, I'LL DO IT.
Barney, BARNEY, BARNEY.
tell YOUR CLNT HE'LL TAKE FIVE TO TEN FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT,
or I'LL GET A JURY TO PUT HIM AWAY FOR 20 ON ATTEMPTED HOMICID
you're A DOL BYE.
how WAS LAST NIGHT?
last NIGHT WAS, UH...
last NIGHT WAS GOOD-LOOKING, SMART AND HAS GREAT ABS.
I MEAN SIX-PACK, NOT JUST THE TOP TWO.
have I MENTIONED SINGLE LIFE IS FABULOUS?
and HOW'D YOU MEET THIS ONE?
saw HIM ON THE TREADMILL. WOOF.
only ONE PROBLEM. -WHAT, ONLY ONE?
Claire's GUEST ROOM IS NOT THE PLACE FOR LATE-NIGHT SCREAMS OF PASSION.
screams?
a FRIEND AT MERCY TELLS ME THE KID SHOT LAST NIGHT PULLED THROUGH.
Yeah, HE'S OUT OF I. C.U.
but HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
this ONE, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS NOT SO LUCKY.
chief MEDICAL EXAMINER CAME IN TO LOOK,
said THIS IS WHY HE LIKED BEING BEHIND A DESK
and HAD DEPUTIES LIKE ME.
we MIGHT GET AN I. D. ON HIM.
I MANAGED A PARTIAL THUMBPRINT.
pretty GOOD ONE.
what? HE BARELY HAS A HAND.
just ENOUGH SKIN LEFT, THOUGH.
did YOU SEND THE PRINT TO QUANTICO?
and S.F.P.D. LIKE EVERY OTHER TIME I'VE GOTTEN PRINTS.
I TOOK THESE OUT OF HIM.
one OF 'EM BLEW HIS HEART APART.
what KIND OF BULLET IS THAT?
very CHICHI-- INCENDIARY. 308.
in ENGLISH, THAT WOULD BE?
it HITS YOUR GAS TANK--BOOM.
that's PROBABLY AN ANSWER TO MY PARTIAL PRINT.
I ESS OUR JOHN DOE HERE IS IN THE SYSTEM.
he's NOT A DRUG DEALER.
his NAME IS STEVEN RUSSO...
and HE'S A COP.
steven RUSSO--HE WAS ONE OF OURS, UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS.
and HE WASN'T JUST KILLED, HE WAS BURNED ALIVE.
we're GONNA FIND WHO DID THIS AND LET THEM KNOW
what IT MEANS WHEN THEY KILL A COP.
boxer AND JACOBI ARE LEAD INSPECTORS.
okay, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW.
the WHITE VAN WAS OURS.
it WAS HIS UNDERCOVER VEHICLE.
what WE DON'T KNOW IS IF HE WAS KILLED BECAUSE HE WAS A COP.
the MESSAGE, PEOPLE, DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING.
all RIGHT, MITCHELL'S TEAM, YOU TAKE STREET SOURCES.
Miller's TEAM, TAKE CENTRAL RECORDS.
I'm LIAISON TO NARCOTICS.
let's GO.
do WE KNOW WHAT RUSSO WAS DOING UNDERCOVER?
nothing YET.
okay, WHY THE STONEWALL FROM NARCOTICS?
it's MESSY. ONE OF THEIR GUYS IS DOWN.
I'd ACT THE SAME WAY.
boxer, JACOBI, THEY NEED YOU IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM.
Oh, HEY, HEY, LINZ, UH, LOOK, SINCE KISS ME NOT KILLER HAS BEEN QUIET
for FOUR MONTHS NOW, THE FEDS NO LONGER CONSIDER YOU A TARGET.
throw A PARTY.
no MORE FBI AGENTS IN YOUR REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
they DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE HE'S DONE.
maybe WE CAUGHT A BREAK HERE.
don't BET ON IT, TOM. THEY NEVER QUIT.
I WANT TO TALK TO RUSSO'S WIFE.
no. NARCOTICS HASN'T NOTIFIED HER YET.
he WAS UNDERCOVER. IT'S AN ONGOING OPERATION.
do YOU HAVE ANY LEADS AT ALL?
you KNOW, THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
there's SOMETHING I DON'T GET.
this GUY IN THE RED HOOD,
thone THAT BLEW UP RUSSO'S VAN--HE GOT THE DROP ON ME.
he HAD AN ASSAULT RIFLE INCHES FROM MY HEAD.
he'd ALREADY KILLED ANOTHER PERSON.
so WHY DIDN'T HE SHOOT ME, YOU KNOW?
why LET ME LIVE?
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
if SOME GUY HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD,
I'd BE A TOTAL MESS... UNLESS IT WAS HIM.
you're DROOLING.
you're NOT? -NO.
just OBSERVING.
three COFFEES, LIGHT.
who's THAT?
we DON'T KNOW, BUT LINDSAY LIKES HIM.
grow UP.
wow, HE LIKES YOU.
right NOW HE'S DNG A CLASSIC TAKE-A-SECOND-LOOK FAKE PHONE CALL.
he'll TURN THIS WAY IN FIVE SECONDS.
that's RIDICULOUS.
okay, NOT TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.
go TALK TO HIM, AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, FORGET TOM.
Oh, GOD, THAT'S... OVER.
I MEAN, OFFICIALLY, IT'S OVER.
and--and I AM READY TO--TO GET BACK OUT THERE.
I'm JUST NOT A MAKE- THE-FIRST-MOVE KIND OF GIRL.
so CLAIRE SAID THAT THE WHITE VAN
was BLOWN UP USING INCENDIARY BULLETS.
can I USE THAT? -SURE.
do WE HAVE ANYTHING ON THE VICTIM--NAME, AGE, ANYTHING?
still WORKING ON IT.
all RIGHT, WELL, KEEP ME POSTED.
why DID WE JUST LIE TO HER?
why DIDN'T WE TELL HER THE VICTIM'S A COP?
undercover COP.
well, I HEAR TOM TALKED TO NARCO AGAIN.
they WON'T LET US TALK TO RUSSO'S WIFE.
we're STILL GETTING A STONEWALL FROM NARCOTICS?
she DESERVES TO KNOW HER HUSBAND IS DEAD.
let's PRETEND WE DIDN'T GET THAT MESSAGE AND GO SEE HER ANYWAY.
I BEGGED HIM TO QUIT.
anything BUT UNDERCOVER.
he--he WAS A DEDICATED COP.
he SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEDICATED TO US!
mom? MOM?
Nicky WON'T GIVE ME THE REMOTE. -ALL RIGHT.
Hey, GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME YOUR ROOM? -OKAY, COME ON!
do YOU KNOW IF STEVE WAS ON ASSIGNMENT?
I ONLY SAW HIM TWO OR THREE NIGHTS A WEEK.
you KNOW HOW IT IS.
they HAVE TO AVOID BEING FOLLOWED.
when WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?
monday NIGHT.
you MARRIED, INSPECTOR?
uh, NO.
well, A WIFE ALWAYS KNOWS, AND I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN,
even BEFORE HE TOLD ME.
what DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN HE WANTED OUT...
and I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET HIM GO BACK.
this WAS YESTERDAY.
Hey, it's me.
I got a minute.
I just wanted to say you were
things are crazy out here-- really strange.
it's goin' bad.
so listen, I'm gonna make them bring me in, and I'm never goin' out again. I love you.
Hey, KID.
you COULD SAY "DAD.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WOULD HAVE PHONED, BUT...
you DON'T TAKE MY CALLS.
it's BEEN WHAT, SIX YEARS? -SEVEN.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE COUNTING.
when YOU GOT THROWN OFF THE FORCE,
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR LIFE.
you CROSSED THE LINE, TALKING TO THE WIDOW.
I STILL HAVE A FEW FRIENDS IN THE DEPARTMENT WHO TALK TO ME.
watch OUT, KID.
people SEE YOU BENDING THE RULES, AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY.
me, BENDING THE RULES?
sorry. I DON'T NEED CAREER ADVICE FROM A DIRTY EX-COP.
don't GO EASY ON ME JUST 'CAUSE I'M YOUR OLD MAN.
right, I FORGOT. IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.
Marty, IT'S MY JOB. IT'S MY CASE. IT'S MY LI.
stay AWAY.
your SOURCES IN THE HOMICIDE BUREAU
they SAID THEY COULDN'T I. D. THE VICTIM IN THAT EXPLOSION?
that's WHAT THEY SAID.
my SOURCES SAY THE BODY IN THE VAN WAS AN UNDERCOVER COP.
narcotics FLIPPED OUT WHEN ASKED FOR COMMENT.
I'll... UH, I'-- I'LL LOOK INTO IT.
undercover COP SHOT IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
if WE WAIT TOO LONG TO GO WITH IT,
the "CHRONICLE" WILL HAVE IT FIRST.
we're GOING WITH SCOTT'S STORY.
how's MR. WILCOX DOING ON OUR MAN IN THE RED HOOD?
in YOUR COMPUTER IN TEN MINUTES.
Thanks.
Hey, LINZ. THE "REGISTER" HAS ATORY UP
unnamed UNDERCOVER COP KILLED.
every RELATIVE OF EVERY UNDERCOVER COP WITHIN 100 MILES
is CALLING TO SEE IF THEIR LOVED ONE DIED IN THAT VAN.
have WE HEARD FROM NARCOTICS YET?
zip, NADA, NOTHING. -OKAY.
any RELATIVE THAT CALLS NEEDS TO BE INTERVIEWED BY AN INSPECTOR,
and ANYTHING INTERTING COMES STRAIGHT TO US.
you ALL KNEW THE VICTIM WAS A COP, AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.
when AN OFFICER GETS KILLED, PEOPLE GET SCARED.
we HADN'T EVEN NOTIFIED THE WIFE YET.
don't YOU THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE HELD THE STORY?
what, SUDDENLY YOU DON'T TRUST ME?
Cindy, WE ABSOLUTELY TRUST YOU.
funny WAY OF SHOWING IT.
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE FRIENDS.
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE IN THIS TOGETHER.
I've... -COFFEE LIGHT.
I JUST--I DON'T USUALLY DO THIS.
I-I LEFT MY MONEY IN MY WALLET.
don't EVEN SWEAT IT.
just PAY ME LATER. -THANK YOU.
sorry.
you SEEM... -ANNOYED AND FRUSTRATED?
no, I WAS GONNA SAY U SEEM TO LIKE COFFE. -I'M PETE. PETE RAYNOR. -HI. LINDSAY BOXER.
Hi. -HI.
I've BEEN FIENDING FOR A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN FOR HOURS.
you DON'T LOOK BLUEBERRY.
what DO I LOOK LIKE?
more... SCONE.
know SOMETHING, LINDSAY BOXER? YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.
tha-- THA-THAT'S QUITE A JUMP FROM SCONES.
we CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO PASTRY. NO, NO, NO. UH, IT'S...
thank YOU.
sorry.
well, I SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK. -YEAH, OF COURSE.
I MEAN, I-I WILL, TOO. -ALL RIGHT.
okay. -EXCUSE ME.
um, I'LL STAY. LOOK... OKAY.
you KNOW, WE ALL GET FRUSTRATED AND ANNOYED SOMETIMES.
sure, OKAY, LINDSAY. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
you CONNECT WITH HIM, BUT HE DOESN'T ASK FOR YOUR PHONE NUMBER.
I'm SURE THERE'S A LOGICAL EXPLANATION.
right. -RIGHT.
Yep, NO PROBLEM.
Sutton JUST INTERVIEWED A RELATIVE WHO CAME IN,
says WE SHOULD TALK TO HER. SHE IS ON HER WAY UP.
what?
nothing. -COME ON.
no, IT'S STUPID.
okay, WHAT WOULD PROMPT YOU, A GUY WHO THINKS A WOMAN IS "VERY PRETTY, TO NOT ASK FOR HER PHONE NUMBER? TOTALLY HYTHETICAL.
you're RIGHT. IT'S STUPID.
told YOU. -MAYBE I'M MARRIED.
no RING. -I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
walks LIKE A SINGLE GUY. -GAY.
I'd KNOW. -THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO.
I'm POSITIVE.
inspector BOXER?
sandy FOSTER. I WAS TOLD TO SEE YOU.
right, YEAH. UH, THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.
this IS INSPECTOR JACOBI.
Hi. -HI.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A RELATIVE WHO'S UNDERCOVER?
Yeah, ANDY McCARTHY. HE'S IN NARCOTICS.
look, I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF HE'S THE COP THAT WAS KILLED.
be-- MRS. FOSTER, THE MAN WHO WAS KILLED ISN'T NAMED ANDY McCARTHY.
Oh, MY GOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
the--the PROBLEM IS--IS WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TODAY.
he ALWAYS CALLS ME WEDNESDAY MORNINGS.
so, I MEAN, OUR--OUR DAD IS IN THE HOSPITAL,
so HE CALLS FOR UPDATES AND
you're SURE IT WASN'T HIM IN THAT VAN? IT WASN'T HIM.
okay.
anyway, I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO WORK. -THANK YOU.
Andy McCARTHY. UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS? JUST LIKE RUSSO.
undercover NARCOTICS. McCARTHY.
Oh, MY GOD.
does ANDY McCARTHY LOOK LIKE THE GUY THAT BLEW UP THAT VAN?
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW THIS.
inspector ANDY McCARTHY KILLED INSPECTOR STEVE RUSSO.
one UNDERCOVER COP KILLING ANOTHER, WHY?
I CAN THINK OF A FEW REASONS. I DON'T LIKE ANY OF 'EM.
Lindsay, WARREN-- BILL SCHROEDER, NARCOTICS.
I UNDERSTAND YOU THINK ONE OF MY INSPECTORS HAS GONE BAD.
well, CAPTAIN, IT LOOKS THAT WAY.
we HAVE A WITNESS SKETCH OF THE MAN THAT BLEW UP STEVE RUSSO'S VAN. IT'S ANDY McCARTHY.
so ANDY McCARTHY, TEN YEARS WITH THE DEPARTMEN HAS STARTED WORKING
for DRUG DEALERS AND KILLING OTHER COPS?
I DON'T BUY IT.
it's HIM IN THE SKETCH, AND HE DID BLOW UP RUSSO'S VAN.
what OTHER EXPLANATION WOULD YOU SUGGEST?
there's AN OLD EXPRESSION-- WHEN YOU HEAR HOOFBEATS IN THE FOREST,
you LOOK FOR A HORSE, NOT A ZEBRA.
steve RUSSO WAS POSING AS A DRUG DEALER.
it WAS PROBABLY ANOTHER DRUG DEALER THAT KILLED HIM.
I DISAGREE, AND WE NEED TO QUESTION McCARTHY.
not WHILE HE'S ON THE STREET.
we're DONE HERE.
were McCARTHY AND RUSSO WORKING A CASE TOGETHER?
Yes.
just THE TWO OF THEM?
one OTHER OFFICER-- HENRY KRAFT.
you WANT TO TELL ME HE'S DIRTY, TOO?
well, ACTUALLY, SIR, NO,
I WOULDN'T BET ON TWO COPS GOING BAD AT THE SAME TIME.
kraft COULD BE IN DANGER.
if McCARTHY'S KILLED ONE OF HIS PARTNERS,
we SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHER ONE.
captain, PULL KRAFT OFF THE STREET.
I DON'T NEED ADVICE ON HOW TO RUN MY UNIT.
if KRAFT DIES, IT'S ON YOU.
stay AWAY FROM McCARTHY, KRAFT, THEIR FAMILIES... AND ME.
get HER IN LINE, OR I GO TO THE CHIEF.
you GO AFTER A CAPTAIN LIKE THAT, LINDSAY?
he's GOT A DIRTY COP IN HIS UNIT, AND HE WON'T ACCEPT THE TRUTH.
you KNOW WHAT? IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,
I'll HAVE NO CHOICE.
I'll HAVE TO TAKE YOU OFF THIS CASE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, -BUT I HEAR YOUR DAD DROPPED BY THIS MORNING. -DON'T DO THIS.
come ON, WE WERE MARRIED WHEN THEY GOT YOUR DAD.
I WATCHED YOU GO THROUGH IT.
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS.
this ISN'T ABOUT MY DAD.
we BOTH KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVE.
what I THINK ABOUT ANDY McCARTHY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY FATHER.
they're BOTH DIRTY COPS.
if I WAS YOUR PRIEST, I'D SAY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR REDEMPTION.
well, I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT MY PRIEST.
Hey, LINZ.
ed, YOU LOOK GOOD. -WELL, YOU KNOW, I TRY.
but SHE'S ALL YOURS.
I GOT A YOUNG COP WAITING TO BE TOLD HIS LIFE ISN'T OVER JUST 'CAUSE HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR.
see YOU AT HOME? -ALL RIGHT. BYE, BABY.
see YOU. -SEE YOU LATER.
I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. -YEAH?
Tom SAYS I'M GOING AFTER THIS DIRTY COP SO AGGRESSIVELY BECAUSE OF MY FATHER.
he's CRAZY, RIGHT? -MAYBE.
and MAYBE HE HAS A POINT.
maybe YOU'RE BOTH CRAZY.
fine, I'LL SHUT UP.
what's THE MATTER?
sorry.
just WORKING SOME THINGS OUT.
what, IS THIS ABOUT JILL SAYING YOU GUYS
are CRAMPING HER STYLE AGAIN?
no, SHE HASN'T MENTIONED THAT IN A WHILE.
it's ED. IT'S NOT WORKING.
it?
I KNEW THERE WAS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT THE PARALYSIS WOULD GET WORSE,
and ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS WOULD BE DOWN THE, YOU KNOW.
your CASE LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU HELPED THAT DTOR'S DAUGHTER?
I TRIED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER, BUT THERE'S A 6-MONTH WAIT.
maybe YOU CAN PULL SOME STRINGS?
sure. -THANKS.
how LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON?
almost THREE MONTHS, AND HONESTLY, I AM GOING OUT OF MY MIND.
I WILL CALL HER TODAY. -THANK YOU.
and I HEARD ABOUT YOUR HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION.
he FLIRTED, I FLIRTED, AND NOTHING.
maybe HE'S SHY.
I'd SAY HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF SHY.
maybe HE'S GAY. -I'D KNOW.
I'm POSITIVE. I'M POSITIVE!
I'll SEE YOU AFTER LUNCH.
they're PREPPING ME FOR MY GRAND JURY TESTIMONY ON THAT DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN THE MISSION.
Yeah, GRAND JURY...
I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIND HENRY KRAFT.
if YOU'RE SUGGESTING WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SUGGESTING,
the ANSWER IS NO.
these THREE COPS WERE MAKING CASES A LONG TIME UNDERCOVER.
they MUST HAVE GIVEN CONFIDENTIAL GRAND JURY TESTIMONY.
Linz, NO.
if I CAN SEE THEIR TESTIMONY,
I CAN FIND OUT WHERE THEY WORKED AND WHERE THEY HUNG OUT,
and THEN I CAN FIND HENRY KRAFT.
you're TALKING ABOUT SEALED DOCUMENTS-- THEIR TESTIMONY, -THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S NOTES. -I KNOW.
I DO THIS-- SOMEONE FINDS OUT,
the LEAST--I LOSE MY JOB.
I COULD BE DISBARRED.
narcotics WON'T GIVE ME ANYTHING. COME ON, JILL.
I'm TELLING YOU, THIS COP IS IN TROUBLE.
I NEED SOMETHING BESIDES YOUR HUNCH.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.
you're NOT GONNA HELP ME?
this ISN'T ABOUT YOU, JUST LIKE IT WASN'T ABOUT CINDY.
we're FRIENDS, BUT WE ALL HAVE JOBS TO DO.
I'd LIKE TO KEEP MINE. -OKAY.
I'M-A FIND ANDY McCARTHY, AND I'M-A FIND HENRY KRAFT.
and IF YOU DON'T HELP ME, I'M-A FIND A WAY.
they SAID THE FBI WAS FINISHED KEEPING AN EYE ON ME.
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN, BUT YOU'RE WASTING THE XPAYERS' MONEY.
I'm NOT A FED, INSPECTOR,
and YOU SHOULD STOP TELLING STORIES ABOUT ANDY McCARTHY BEING DIRTY.
what IS YOUR NAME, OFFICER?
look, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH ANDY McCARTHY'S CHECKING,
his SAVINGS, CREDIT CARDS.
he IS LIVING ON HIS SALARY, LINZ.
nothing HERE SAYS HE'S ON A DRUG DEALER'S PAYROLL. NOTHING.
I'm BUYING.
if HE'S NOT ON A DEALER'S PAYROLL, WHY'D HE KILL A COP?
coffee LIGHTS, UH, MOCHA SUPREMO WITH EXTRA CARAMEL.
Jacobi's HOOKED ON SUGAR. -YEAH.
uh, THERE WAS A GUY HERE YESTERDAY.
Oh, YEAH, MR. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.
Yeah. UH... OH,
uh, KAY, UH, NONFAT LATTE, DOUBLE SHOT.
he WOR IN THAT OFFICE BUILDING.
next TIME HE PASSES BY,
do YOU WANT ME TO MENTION YOU WERE ASKING?
Yeah. -YEAH?
no. -NO?
no. -NO?
thank YOU.
I'll DRINK JACOBI'S MOCHA. LET'S WALK.
I GOTTA TELL YA, EVERYONE THINKS YOU'RE A LITTLE OVERINVESTED
in THIS BECAUSE OF YOUR DAD.
I AM TRYING TO SAVE A COP'S LIFE, OKAY?
this HAS NOTHING TO DO WITHE OR MY DAD.
Linz, WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BEING MARTIN BOXER'S DAUGHTER
the LOOKS, THE WHISPERS, LIVING WITH IT YOUR WHOLE CAREER.
if I SAY YOU'RE RIGHT, WILL YOU GIVE ME THE GRAND JURY NOTES?
anyone FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS, I COULD END UP DOING TIME,
and I DON'T THINK I'D ENJOY THE FOOD IN PRISON.
read IT AND BURN IT.
before McCARTHY KILLED STEVE RUSSO,
they WORKED A COUPLE OF CASES TOGETHER.
the THIRD COP--HENRY KRAFT
was PART OF THOSE OPERATIONS, TOO.
this WILL TELL YOU WHO THEY TALKED TO AND WHERE THEY GO.
officer HENRY KRAFT?
you WANT SOMEBODY ELSE.
I'm INSPECTOR BOXER.
this IS INSPECTOR JACOBI. WE NEED TO TALK.
I DON'T NEED TO TALK TO NOBODY.
one OF YOUR GUYS-- McCARTHY--TURNED.
you HEARD ABOUT STEVE RUSSO?
McCarthy KILLED HIM.
not A CHANCE. I KNOW McCARTHY.
we THINK McCARTHY'S AFTER YOU NOW.
I'm UNDERCOVER.
I'm GONNA STAY UNDER UNTIL I GET CALLED IN.
now THE ONLY ONES LOOKING TO GET ME KILLED ARE YOU.
we GOTTA TAKE HIM IN.
mccarthy, DON'T DO IT!
come ON, MAN. EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE COPASETIC.
come ON, BABY, PUT THE GUN DOWN.
come ON, McCARTHY.
come ON, ANDY.
put IT DOWN. JUST PUT IT DOWN.
that's IT.
Where's McCARTHY?
he's MY GUY, SO I'LL DO THE INTERVIEW.
captain... -NOT ANOTHER WORD.
you WENT AFTER HIM IN DIRECT DEFIANCE OF MY ORDERS.
bill, IT'S BOXER'S CASE. -STEP BACK, TOM.
boxer IS THE REASON THAT HENRY KRAFT
is IN THE HOSPITAL, NOT IN THE MORGUE.
you've BEEN BLOCKING US EVERY STEP OF THE WA AND I GET IT
you GOT A BAD COP, YOU WANT TO CLEAN YOUR OWN HOUSE,
it STOPS HERE, OR I GO TO I. A.
I'm WATCHING.
Hi, ANDY.
Andy, WE NEED TO TALK.
I HAVE TO GO.
I CAN'T BE HERE.
you WANT TO TELL ME WHY YOU SHOT HENRY KRAFT?
you COULD HAVE SHOT ME, BUT YOU DIDN'T. WHY IS THAT?
man, I HAVE TO GO.
I CANNOT BE HERE.
I CAN'T BE HERE!
tell ME ABOUT THE WATCH.
RAMOS... HE GAVE IT TO ME.
Salvadorian DRUG LORD.
they DO THAT.
they BUY YOU THINGS AND TREAT YOU LIKE A-A FRIEND.
but YOU'RE NOT.
RAM-- BUT RAMOS, MAN, HE SAW RIGHT THRGH ME.
Ramos MADE YOU?
he FIGURED OUT I WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER.
and THEN THEY... THEY... THEY PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD.
they MADE ME TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
they TOLD ME I HAD TO KILL RUSSO AND KRAFT.
Andy, WHY DIDN'T YOU COME IN AND TELL US?
because... THEY FOUND OUT WHERE I LIVE.
Oh, GOD.
they're IN MY HOME.
they HAVE MY WIFE AND MY SON.
I DIDN'T WANT TO KILL ANYONE.
I HAD TO.
they HAVE MY FAMILY.
they HAVE MY FAMILY.
okay. OKAY.
the HOSTAGES ARE A WOMAN AND HER 10-YEAR-OLD SON.
there ARE TWO CAPTORS.
I WANT NO POLICE PRESENCE WITHIN SIGHT OF THAT HOUSE.
these GUYS SEE ANY SIGN OF LICE, THEY'LL KILL THE HOSTAGES.
I GOT IT, LIEUTENANT.
no UNIFORMS, NO SECTOR CARS.
my MEN KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.
judge ANDERSON ISSUED WARRANTS
to COVER ENTRY AND SURVEILLANCE.
you WOULDN'T THINK WE'D NEED WARRANTS TO SAVE TWO PEOPLE'S LIVES, RIGHT?
which IS WHY YOU CARRY THE GUN, AND I SEE THE JUDGE.
good LUCK.
Hey, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE. WHAT'S UP?
I'm SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT RUSSO.
it's OKAY.
what's WITH THE BODY ARMOR?
frankly, IT'S A LITTLE BULKY ON YOU.
we GOT TWO HOSTAGES, AND WE'RE GONNA GO GET 'EM.
it's YOUR EXCLUSIVE IF YOU WANT TO WATCH.
wait, IF YOU'RE DOING THIS JUSTECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY,
I WANT TO SAY, AWESOME!
Lindsay, SHE SIGNS A LIABILITY RELEASE.
get IT BEFORE WE LEAVE.
suddenly, THIS FEEL VERY SERIOUS.
can WE SEE IN THE HOUSE AT ALL?
they've GOT EVERY FRONT WINDOW COVERED.
we MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE SOMETHING FROM THE BACK.
anything FROM PARABOLICS?
still POSITIONING.
we SHOULD HAVE EARS INSIDE IN A MINUTE.
heat SENSOR'S UP.
that MUST BE TWO OF RAMOS' MEN.
now WHERE ARE THE HOSTAGES?
okay, McCARTHY'S WIFE, SON ON THE FLOOR.
that's A WATER HEATER BELOW THEM.
we GOTTA GET 'EM OUOF THAT ROOM.
we GO IN WHEN HE'S THERE, HE'LL KILL 'EM ALL.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO -GOT SOMETHING ON THE HORN.
one OF 'EM's MAKING A CELL CALL.
whoever HE'S TALKING TO SAYS... McCARTHY HASN'T CHECKED IN.
the GUY IN THE HOUSE WANTS TO KNOW IF IT'S TIME TO SHUT IT DOWN.
the CALLER THINKS, BUT WANTS TO CONFIRM.
says HE'LL CALL BACK WITH AN ANSWER IN FIVE MINUTES.
they're GONNA KILL THAT WOMAN AND HER CHILD.
all RIGHT, WE CREATE A DIVERSION AT THE FRONT,
draw THE SECOND GUARD INTO THE LIVING ROOM.
we GO IN. -I'LL GO.
no. THEY WILL MAKE YOU AS A COP AND KILL THOSE PEOPLE BEFORE YOU CAN RING THE DOORBELL.
and THEY WON'T MAKE YOU?
you GOT "COP" TATTOOED ON YOUR FOREHEAD.
all RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WE NEED SOMEONE ELSE.
call THE BUREAU.
we CAN'T GET ANYBODY HERE IN FIVE MINUTES. -I CAN DO IT.
forget IT.
you NEED SOMEONE WHO'S NOT A COP. THAT'S ME.
and I SPEAK SPANISH.
I SAID FORGET IT.
you're A CIVILIAN. IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.
narcotics USED CIVILIAN DECOYS IN A STRING OF BUSTS IN THE HAIGHT LAST YEAR.
those WERE FOR DIME BAG BUSTS, NOT HOSTAGE SITUATIONS.
lieutenant, THEY'RE MOVING THE WOMAN AND CHILD.
you HAVE TO LET ME DO IT.
tell ME HOW.
okay. YOU'LL KNOW WHEN WE START TO MAKE OUR MOVE, ALL RIGHT?
you'll SEE US COMING IN.
the MOMENT THAT YOU DO, DROP TO THE GROUND.

I SPENT TWO YEARS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE TO TESTIFY AGAINST RAMOS.
now I'M GONNA DO IT MYSELF.
whatever WORKS.
cost STEVE RUSSO HIS LIFE.
I-I DIDN'T KNOW HIM THAT WELL.
we WEREN'T FRIENDS.
now HE'S IN MY HEAD EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY...
the COP I KILLED.
steve RUSSO... THE COP I KILLED.
two VISITS IN TWO DAYS?
a REALLY UNPLEASANT RECORD.
congratulations ON SAVING THE COP'S FAMILY.
I'm PROUD OF YOU, HON.
wasn't ALWAYS THIS WAY, WAS IT?
I REMEMBER WALKING YOU DOWN THE AISLE
and SNEAKING YOU THAT SLICE OF PIZZA AT THE RECEPTION.
and LOOK HOW ALL THAT TURNED OUT.
good-bye, MARTY.
how DID YOU FIND HENRY KRAFT?
you PULLED OFF A MIRACLE, AND PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW.
they DON'T LIKE YOU FOR IT, LINDSAY.
they SEE YOU CRACKING THESE IMPOSSIBLE CASES,
and THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.
what HAVE YOU GOT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS?
who's ASKING--SCHROEDER? -NOT JUST HIM.
so THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE
to TELL ME THAT PEOPLE ARE PISSED OFF BECAUSE I'M A GOOD COP.
no, I'M HERE TO WARN YOU NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.
I WONT BE TAKING PAPER BAGS FULL OF $50s FROM DOMINIC BUCCI,
if THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
is THAT WHAT YOU THINK I DID?
it's WHAT THE COURT SAYS YOU DID.
if A CASE LIKE THIS TEACHES YOU ANYTHING,
it's THAT THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY APPEAR.
I'm STILL YOUR FATHER, LIKE IT OR NOT.
see YOU AROUND, LINDSAY.
Hey. -HI.
how MUCH DID YOU HEAR?
didn't HEAR A THIN
we've BEEN, COLLECTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF
why AN ELIGIBLE MAN WOULDN'T ASK A SMART, FUNNY,
strong, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FOR HER PHONE NUMBER.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
And?
it's THE GUN.
the GUN? -SCARED HIM OFF.
I WASN'T CARRYING A GUN.
Oh, BUT HE COULD SENSE THE GUN. -YEAH.
face IT, LINZ, SOME WOMEN ARE ALWAYS CARRYING THEIR GUN,
even WHEN THEY'RE NOT.
sweetie, WE LOVE HAVING YOU AS A HOUSEGUEST,
but WE'RE CRAMPING YOUR STYLE.
actually, I THINK I'M CRAMPING YOURS.
guess OUR WALLS ARE PRETTY THIN, HUH?
how MUCH HAVE YOU HEARD? -A LOT.
all RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MARRIAGE, CLAIRE, EXCEPT THEBVIOUS,
which IS CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT TWO PEOPLE,
not JUST ONE.
come HERE.
great JOB TODAY.
and I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT UP YOUR FATHER.
it WASN'T ABOUT HIM.
night.
look, IF YOU THINK THIS DOCTOR FRIENDF LINDSAY'S CAN HELP
no, I DON'T.
what?
you DON'T NEED A DOCTOR, ED. we do
someone THAT WE CAN TALK TO ABOUT
what's BEEN GOING ON...
with BOTH OF US.
Lindsay BOXE -I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
me FIRST. HOW'D YOU FIND ME?
I'm A DETECTIVE. -YEAH, I HEARD.
the KID AT THE COFFEE CART.
I TOLD HIM NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.
your QUESTION? -RIGHT. MY QUESTION IS...
why DOES A MAN HAVE A NICE CONVERSATION WITH A WOMAN THAT HE THINKS IS PRETTY,
and THEN DOESN'T ASK FOR HER NUMBER?
maybe THE MAN THOUGHT ABOUT ASKING FOR HER NUMBER.
W HARD DID HE THINK ABOUT ASKING?
it OCCUPIED HIS WHOLE AFTERNOON,
including A NUMBER OF CALLS TO FRIENDS FOR ADVICE.
but THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE'S ONLY IN TOWN FOR TWO WEEKS.
where ARE YOU GOING? -CAMBODIA. I BUILD HOTELS.
I'm THERE FOR A YEAR.
so YOU THINK IN TWO WEEKS I'LL GET ATTACHED,
and THEN YOU'LL BREAK MY HEART?
no, LINDSAY, I THINK IN TWO WEEKS, LEAVING MIGHT BREAK MINE.
still, I WAS, UM... I WAS ABOUT TO COME FIND YOU.
are YOU-- ARE YOU A GOOD DETECTIVE?
well, I'M--I'M BETTER AT MY JOB THAN I AM AT THIS.
well, THEN, DETECTIVE, WHO ARE THOSE FLOWERS FOR?
I-I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION.
to LINDSAY.
you WANT TO GET SOMETHINGO EAT? -YEAH.
n't FORGET THE FLOWERS. -OKAY.
I don't sting my nose!
you idiot!
I'm outta here.
that's for girls.
use the men's room then!
you're tall. I bone you yet?
my blow. - All gone!
you fucker! - It's all gone!
he's a total headcase!
meet Ludo.
Ludo, this is Christine.
not Christine. Christelle!
what?
yours is mine and mine is mine.
that's not cool. Cut it out!
you okay?
Hey, dude! I called David!
he's on his way.
this is rocking! We're gonna burn it up.
say, why don't you ever call me?
you never call me. Straight up.
chill out, bro.
I'll be right back.
you're going? - For a smoke.
Eric bounced?
you're splitting? - I'm beat.
see you soon.
how are you?
nearly missed it.
Hey.
is Juliette coming?
I don't know.
I guess not.
what?
she won't come.
while I'm here.
did she call? Did she...
Antoine, give us a break. This is not the time.
Yeah, sorry. I was just wondering...
I guess she'll come after I...
Where's Marie?
she said she'd be here but...
pisses me off. She's always late.
pain in the ass!
you mean me, doofus?
we can't all go in together.
or stay too long. Let's split into 2 groups.
who's going first?
I will. - Me too.
we'll wait then. - I'll wait too.
you guys?
wait till they give you masks.
hold on, Eric.
they're really strict.
you been here long?
a half-hour.
I'm going for a smoke.
did Juliette tell you if she'd come by today?
Ludo...
we're here, buddy.
we're all here.
you gave us a hell of a fright.
it's gonna be okay.
you're in good hands.
hey there.
Hi.
you...
you've got a mask.
you too.
I'm getting out.
I'm getting out tomorrow.
you're...
you're all... - Take it easy.
you're all dressed the same.
you're beautiful.
you too, you're beautiful.
get some rest.
he'll be okay.
we leave him all alone a whole month?
Sabine'll be here. I called her.
as if she'd abandon her son! But us...
we just go on vacation?
and leave him like that?
how can we help him, Marie? We can't.
we can be there for him.
or am I just being stupid?
you're right, it's... - I agree.
it's mean of us...
I'm here another week. I'll come by.
hold on...
you all know, Ludo's like a little brother to me.
seeing him like that drives me crazy, but what can we do? Not much.
like the doc said, he's in intensive care.
we can't even visit.
if anything happens, like we said, we fly right back. It's one hour away.
anyway, why'd anything go wrong?
I'll be away for 6 months afterwards.
I want to spend some time with him.
you can all go and I'll stay here.
or we shorten the vacation.
good idea. I agree.
we take 2 weeks while he recovers.
so when we get back, he'll be fit enough to see us.
what do you say, Marie?
that's okay, isn't it?
it's a good compromise.
how about it? Let's do that.
sounds good to me.
get off that.
damn it!
I have to go.
I'm putting it out. - You quit!
I gotta run. - Where?
the Opera. My rehearsal.
see you later. I'll call you.
Bye, everyone.
lea's saying goodbye.
deep breath.
that's good. And again.
jeez, I love that!
it feels so good.
you're right, I was in agony.
you leave it till you're bent double.
I know. I should drop by.
but right now...
quitting smoking, the hotel expansion, that idiot waiter suing me, the recession and now Ludo's accident...
and you're hardly Mr. Laidback.
you said it.
C'mon, flip over.
you at the hotel tonight?
never mind.
Why? What's up?
I wanted a talk.
I need your advice on something.
it's important. - Join us for dinner.
or you prefer just us guys?
Yeah, but I don't want to impose.
I'll talk to her.
I'd be glad. Her sister's a pain.
C'mon, on your back.
I'm always scared she'll tell Véro I banged her.
Véro knows. She told me about it.
that's massive. Why didn't she tell me?
I don't know.
let go...
you're tense, buddy.
okay, one...
two...
relax.
if it's one of your orgies, count me out.
I can't fool around.
whatever.
just keep the cousin occupied in case she's a skank.
I texted her, you know.
I said, I know how you feel. Get the double meaning?
pretty smart, huh?
poor kid's having a tough time. It's hard for her too.
maybe I put too much pressure on her...
then again, her text speaks for itself.
it means something.
I never understand her texts.
too many idiot metaphors. She's a walking dictionary.
she's been toying with you for months while she shags someone else.
in your bed.
how you doing?
and you?
what's your name again? - Virginie.
Antoine...
nice to meet you.
Where's your cousin?
missed her train. All the more for me. You ever done a double?
you know, a DP.
where are you going?
forget it.
I shocked him?
Vincent!
come quickly!
go on... Tell Daddy what you just told me.
I'm tired from making love too much.
that's good, son.
how many girlfriends now?
nine.
nine girlfriends? That's huge, honey!
you're a real ladies man!
it's only natural.
these guys are stupid. As if the recession just happened.
they open the paper, Oh, a recession!
look...
when I bought this place, 65 staff. 38 now, same profits.
I have some stories to tell. But you...
you wanted to talk?
I wanted your advice. Actually, no...
how can I put it?
I'm having this...
it's pretty weird.
I'm not sure how to deal with it.
a babe?
no, it's not that.
look...
it's hard to talk about it,
wait till I'm done.
how can I say this?
it's just...
I love your hands.
what?
I love your hands.
I don't know what's got into me, but recently I get a strange feeling when I see you.
don't worry, I'm not gay or anything.
it's just you.
I mean...
it's only with you...
that I get this feeling.
I'm trying to get a handle on it.
I mean, I've always admired you.
I like your personality.
the way you fight for things.
I even like your flaws.
you're there when I need to let off steam.
you're my friend, my confidant.
so now...
now I love it when we hug to say goodbye, or when we're watching a game and we jump up in each other's arms.
just that physical contact.
it's weird, I know, but it gives me a thrill.
you're shitting me?
Max...
I was too young when I met Isa.
and now...
she stifles me.
but when I'm with you, I feel so good, relaxed.
maybe I find your presence reassuring.
honestly, I don't get it.
you've known me...
15 years. - Yeah.
in 15 years, I never felt this for a guy. Not once.
you know me, right?
I know I'm not queer.
it's just...
I think I love you.
straight up, I don't wanna kiss you or sleep with you.
maybe one day but...
are you nuts or what? What the hell is this?
you must be out of your mind! What's wrong with you?
I'm your son's godfather. Get real!
are you guys having a joke?
Max, please...
don't react like this. It only makes it harder for me.
I need your support.
as my buddy.
not just as a friend...
my buddy.
you understand?
I don't know what to say.
don't say anything.
it's okay if you can't find the words.
just don't be scared.
whatever shit you're pulling, if this is true...
Max...
please.
what? - Pardon me?
tomorrow?
don't put off till tomorrow... Do it right now.
I don't understand.
do it!
Mr. Cantara? Your friend got the check.
should I take it?
1 new message. Eric.
call me. Urgent.
I was in a movie not so long ago, with this guy I know, Philippe.
a skin flick, but I had a few lines.
that was my first...
what do you want?
are you kidding? You asked me to call you.
no way!
what's wrong?
when?
no way! Why do you always call me to get you out of shit?
you're a maniac.
see ya!
I'm on my way. Bye.
I don't believe it.
what's wrong?
a friend crashed his scooter.
he's in ER. - Shit! I'll come with you.
that's sweet but...
too fucking right I'm coming!
I just need to pee. You pay.
come on...
a complete psycho, you should have seen her!
what a bailer!
what are you up to? A drink?
no, no drink.
why not?
I'm expecting someone.
expecting someone?
who?
bye bye.
fess up, Do I know him?
no, you don't.
he doesn't matter then. Blow him off and let's go out.
I can't, Too late.
you prefer a new-age schmuck to me? I'm on my way and I'm hungry!
don't let your oldest friend starve to death!
Goodnight. - Shame on you!
Goodnight!
hey there...
I brought you flowers.
Thanks.
how are you?
come in.
you okay? - Not bad, actually.
a bit out of breath.
can you get rid of that?
sure, sorry.
what are you doing?
I thought we'd watch the movie together.
I'd rather see it alone.
I can dig that.
I prefer watching movies on my own.
I'll be off then.
night.
I'll see you out.
sorry, it's not my thing.
I know, it's cool.
see you soon. - Bye.
don't butter me up the right way.
I know you architects. Let's not waste our time.
do the job or I'll find someone who can.
think it over and we'll talk.
that's what I said. Goodbye, Mister...
Lother. - Exactly.
Hey.
look...
can we forget all about last night?
I was dumb, blurting that out.
sorry it unnerved you. I had to say it, that's all.
I promise
I won't mention it again.
I mean, it's ridiculous...
you know I'm not queer.
I don't give a damn if you're queer!
not so loud.
sorry.
try to understand. You know what I'm like.
that's why I want you to forget our conversation before it wrecks our friendship.
I don't know why I said it. So...
please accept my apology.
and above all, keep all this to yourself.
Max...
I don't want anyone to know.
okay?
and lastly...
I'll understand if you say no...
does your invitation stand?
sure! Just cut out the l-Iove-your-hands bullshit.
get some help.
I already said I will.
I won't say another word, I promise.
I gotta go.
I need a new architect. No one gives it to me up the ass!
don't worry.
see you tonight?
sure.
Jesus, she's out of order.
my birthday and not even a message.
she left you because you were scared she would.
now what are you scared of?
here, a little extra gift.
what is it?
my ad man pal's mobile. Call him.
shit, I'm so lame. Sorry.
I forgot all about it.
so did he. Why would he give a damn?
it's for you. Call him.
as soon as I settle the Juliette issue, okay?
don't tell her I'm in the shit, will you?
we don't discuss you, Antoine.
you don't?
Thanks. Just what we need.
those guys keep staring at me.
those guys over there keep staring.
it's weird, people keep recognizing me.
chill, you've only done two TV movies.
owned, my friend.
she's right!
I'm just teasing.
truth hurts.
Hey, Marie.
you're back, I see.
Yeah, I got back a few days ago.
how was the Amazon?
I shuttle back and forth.
sure.
goodbye, miss.
I don't get it.
they eat pussy.
she's not 14 anymore. Get over it.
you didn't know?
excuse me.
do you live in a cave?
she's not the first.
get off her case.
I need a leak too.
stop that! It turns you on!
you bet it turns me on.
I'll do it for you at home.
are you nuts! - What's the problem?
don't joke about that. - Not so funny now?
when it's your girlfriend. - Stop!
I'd never have thought it.
to love!
to Ludo!
pace e salute!
Hi, Brigitte! - You're pathetic!
a real pain in the butt.
Hi, Brigitte, how are you?
good to see you. - Same here.
fuck it!
what?
that really pisses me off!
what? What's wrong?
Hi, Brigitte. - Hello, Mr. Max.
what the hell's going on?
I don't understand.
how are you, Marie?
good, Brigitte.
you got it the last 2 years. - Last year was Ludo.
and I sleep with the kids?
sure!
the bedroom?
okay, but if Juliette comes...
don't start with that.
we agreed it was off limits.
if she does, I get the room.
Yes!
I'm here 2 months a year! What do I pay you for?
you remember how much I pay you? 572 euros! Per month!
you could do jack shit all year, I'd never know.
but when you know I'm coming, would it hurt to mow the lawn?
what?
three days ago? Bullshit! I know my lawn.
I don't give a rat's ass!
I arrive with my friends and now what do I look like?
okay, if it was only the lawn...
how many times have I told you about the hose?
I knew it, yellow marks!
listen to me, dipshit!
you can tell that other dipshit,
I want my lawn looking like Versailles, or your company's going belly under!
calm down.
it's just fine. I'll mow the lawn. Where's the mower?
want me to come?
can we buy food?
wait for Véro. You know what she's like.
how are you?
Wow!
he's in a bad mood.
Véro? This is okay surely?
fine, block up your arteries, but not in my house.
and this for when we're rushed?
rushed? We're on vacation.
you don't respect your bodies.
that's not chicken, it's industrial.
full of antibiotics.
Yeah, but it's cheaper.
sure, of course.
Organic's more expensive, sure, but you don't get sick.
or boost pharmaceutical companies' profits.
anyway, when did we ask you to pay for anything?
very subtle.
please!
screw it, I'm buying it. - Me too!
can I take us into the beach? - Sure.
I've been learning. I pass my test in two days.
you can rent one then.
Jean-Louis!
run it up here, Max.
we'll anchor it later.
sure? The tide's going out, I'll be marooned.
it's a neap tide, you'll be fine.
Eric, I can't see a thing!
his tide book's from 1983! I'm doing the ladder! Chill!
how are you?
look at this!
you put it in reverse?
just back it up.
bye bye, Maxie!
shit! I knew it!
it's a motorboat, Max! Use the motors!
see you tonight!
Hello, Jeanne
welcome aboard
Hello, Jeanne
welcome on board...
remember? He wrote that for you when you were born.
Yes.
jean-louis wrote it for me when I was a little baby, one year old.
littler than that.
what can you say in Spanish?
she speaks to the au pair in Spanish.
say something in Spanish.
go on.
Marie never heard you speak Spanish.
wonderful!
it's great here, Jean-Louis.
I think I'll buy you out and fire you.
you loser!
getting speaking parts has gone to his head.
speaking parts!
know what? It's fantastic having you all here.
I miss my little Ludo but...
Yeah, it felt weird when we arrived earlier.
he was still living wild?
he was wired when he had the crash.
Marie and I keep saying we should clean him up.
but do you do anything?
I don't snort that shit with him.
hold on...
the crash was my fault?
he's saying we're all to blame.
he said I encourage him.
don't be silly. He didn't say that.
he's just worried. We all are.
I'll get some crack for the kids.
want a hit?
the Amazon? Your Indians?
sorry, excuse me.
I spent all winter there.
it was great to go back.
I taped over 35 hours of ceremonial laments, sublime chants...
didn't you get my photos?
sure. With you painted all over.
I love it there. It soothes me.
it has it all.
except rosé. So she knocks it back here.
Thanks.
can I have a word?
what? - It's really important.
I know it's off limits, but I'm confused.
don't tell anyone I showed you.
you left some of you with me
you left something at hers?
she means I left a little bit of me behind.
I'm in her thoughts.
alright, okay. So what?
so, do I reply?
definitely not!
what? I don't even reply?
no, don't do anything.
you and Max fell out?
no, we're cool. Everything's fine.
right.
Antoine, push! Come on!
I know it's off limits, but look what she sent.
don't tell anyone I showed you.
I don't reply, right?
sure you should reply. That's really sweet.
what do I say then?
you work it out!
Vincent? I was looking for you.
I need some advice.
I'll just get some clothes. - Stay.
I want to know what you think too.
sit down a minute.
just there.
I have something to ask you.
go on, I'm listening.
can you take a break? I can't think straight.
let's go...
it's really important. I'd like to keep it between us three.
okay? - Sure.
the other evening, after my birthday dinner...
I saw Juliette.
you'll need all the details to form an opinion so...
poker anyone? - We're talking here!
close the door, will you?
so, the night of my birthday, after we said goodbye...
is this your bag?
after we said goodbye in the street, I went home.
to go see Juliette.
wanna play poker?
plant 5 trees in the Amazon...
that's good. - And 5 in Africa.
we'll party like this every night?
hold on, I'm trying to get cable on the TV.
go say goodnight to your children.
and take a Lexomil on the way.
Jesus!
costs me a fortune and they cut me off the only time of the year I use it!
what are you doing?
listen.
what?
the weasels are back.
they must have heard you.
I thought they'd got rid of them.
the fuckers'll eat the insulation!
I'm jinxed right now.
you reap what you sow.
what?
give out shit, you get it back. It's only logical.
send out more positive vibes.
what's up with Vincent?
what do you mean, what's up?
I don't know. You're not talking.
we do, we talk.
Really?
when you're alone maybe. Everyone's asked me about it.
don't bother knocking.
fuck!
Eric, can we talk?
sorry, I'm closed.
I've really screwed up.
I'm so in the shit. I don't know what to do.
let me explain...
I wanted to send her something, a quick text, see?
no, I don't see. I told you not to.
Yeah, but...
what did you send?
I was going to put...
I don't know how to express
exactly. That's why...
I tried to delete it and I accidentally sent "I don't know."
what was her text again?
you left a bit of you with me.
you left a bit of you with me.
I don't know.
what a numbskull, seriously!
great move!
I told you not to reply.
Max, Vincent and Isa said I should send something.
what did you just say?
what? - You're taking the piss?
about what?
you bust my balls with top-secret texts, then you go ask the others?
no, I didn't...
know what, my friend? Grow a pair. You're 35!
it's time to grow up.
Goodnight.
Yeah, goodnight.
Marie, can you tell Juliette
I didn't mean to send her that and I...
you're kidding me.
Goodnight.
what are you doing?
trying to work out how the little bitches get in.
who?
the weasels.
listen!
hear that?
light on or off? - Off.
they're asleep.
it's a pleasure to see you.
great news, you all being here.
it'll bring much joy and happiness.
it's good to see you too.
good morning, Max. How are you?
Hi, Nassim. - I'm overjoyed to see you.
how you doing? - Fine.
morning, Jeanne. Morning, Arthur.
what beautiful children!
I said to Véro, it's marvelous you all being here.
we'll share some good times.
coffee, Nassim?
no, thanks. Vincent and I are going running.
he called me to say he wanted to get some exercise.
come along.
I'm going to the market with Véro.
Hey, Nassim.
great to see you! - You too.
morning, Max.
how are you?
I was telling Véro and Max the joy I feel seeing you all. A real buzz.
that's nice to hear.
congratulations on getting up to go running.
it'll do you good.
too right! Look at this gut!
alright, ready? - Let's go.
see you later. - Enjoy your run.
can you give me a hand?
maybe we should wake them. - At this time?
comes a time you have to choose. Bed or boat.
I don't decide the time of the tides. After 10, it's too late.
we can go later. What's the problem?
why'd I buy the damn boat?
what's that? - Nothing.
do we need towels?
it's up to you. I took one.
we'll be on a boat. There's water all around.
stop it.
it bugs me. All I do for you guys...
stop being like this.
we're out of jam.
Where's Véro? - Waiting outside with the others.
waiting for me?
I woke you 2 hours ago to take the boat out.
an hour ago tops! - No! It's gone 2 p. m.
Lemme eat this, grab a shower, and we'll go.
I'll just put some shorts on.
what's this? - The hotel security cameras.
you're leaving that on?
apparently, music keeps weasels away.
we'll see how they like that! Bitches!
faster! Faster!
awesome, Max!
stop!
slow down!
we can't hear you!
fantastic!
you were great! Great roll!
I told you not to go so fast!
bunch of assholes!
that's right, have a good laugh!
you okay, Marie?
fine, you little shit! Give me the ladder!
when you calm down, we'll let you up.
I am calm. Give me the ladder!
give me the fucking ladder!
calm down.
I am calm! Give me the ladder!
you can come out when you calm down.
calm down for real, please.
stop laughing! Give me the fucking...
no way I'm giving her the ladder. She's on her own.
assholes! - I'll help you up.
fuck you all!
stop laughing!
that's right, enjoy it! Take some photos!
I'll wipe the fucking smiles off your faces!
thank you, miss.
she's gone!
I swear!
you've no idea how jealous he got.
you're putting me on. Ludo? Why didn't he tell me?
you know what he's like. You think he'd tell you that?
he gave me shit for months, saying I had a thing for you.
well? Did you?
to be honest, if I wasn't with him...
I might have been tempted.
sorry, Isa.
it's fine, no worries.
amazing! I didn't notice.
I never picked up on it.
too bad.
I'm going to bed.
hold on, I didn't mean...
I meant, if you hadn't been together.
I'm not upset. I'm glad, in fact.
but I need to sleep.
okay.
everything's fine, Marie.
you coming? - I'll be there in 5.
Goodnight.
Goodnight. See you tomorrow.
shit!
it's cool, don't worry.
he followed me one day.
I swear he did. All the way to your house.
And?
you know when you sense someone's there. I turned round and he was there peeking round a corner, like in a cartoon. Incredible!
he'd lost it or what?
I totally busted him.
I bet he felt stupid.
no, it was cute...
perfect. Let's do one last maneuver.
man overboard, starboard side, north-westerly wind.
excuse me...
I'm sorry.
put that away right now!
Yes, but it's Juliette!
I don't care who it is. Slow down!
you're going too fast!
shit!
what do I do?
it's really important. I'm very sorry.
I'll be right back.
not at all.
and you?
we take the boat out, go swimming...
fun stuff you do by the sea.
colt Silvers!
can you pull over so I can buy some stuff?
fine, I'll pick up some wine. You guys put it away.
we'll buy our share.
it's not a problem. I was only saying.
saying what exactly?
holy shit!
I love that smell!
Marie, smell this!
I'll pass. I feel a bit sick.
is something wrong?
it brings back so many memories. I'm just so happy.
you need help.
and these, and that's it.
hold on...
then 3 grapefruit and 5 oranges.
Jeanne's a beautiful little girl. Hasn't she grown?
Thanks, that's nice.
how about some plums?
I have a list. I'll take care of it.
I'll wait in the car then.
should I go back to Paris?
no, I just need time.
right...
okay.
can you hear me?
they said I couldn't talk long, so I'll be quick.
I just wanted to tell you something very important.
keep it in mind always.
you're a beautiful person.
you're a really beautiful person, Ludo.
there aren't many people like you.
even if it was long ago and even if...
I'm proud that I was your girl.
I also wanted you to know...
although you must have noticed...
that...
I mess up with all the other guys too.
that's all.
thank you.
Hey.
feeling better? - Yeah, I guess.
still a bit pukey. - Same here.
lea's not with you?
she missed her flight. Wasted journey.
Damn! - Yeah, it sucks.
that's enough, cut it out! You're nuts!
you'll wake everybody up!
give it a rest!
I'll just put it away. - Leave it! Put it away later.
I don't believe it!
later, they'll be having breakfast.
shit!
it's gonna leave marks.
you're taking the piss!
stop that! Stop!
speak French!
did you forget Lea?
she's stuck at the Opera. Rehearsals or something.
she won't be here today.
Max, what are you doing?
working out where they get in.
they'll leave prints in the sand and then I can...
why not go for a run?
come on, it clears your mind. You feel great afterwards.
I'm not changed. I'll keep you waiting.
you go ahead.
we'll wait for you.
we're in no hurry.
go on, just for me.
can I come too?
Vincent never lets me.
as if!
of course, you're welcome to join us.
more people, more energy!
great! I'll just get changed.
core exercise is crucial.
your muscles will thank you for it.
you're doing them a favor.
take in only the air you need.
keep your breathing in sync with your stride pattern.
there you go.
even better is not to think about it.
I wasn't thinking about it!
I'm not used to those skis. I couldn't slalom.
what are you doing?
Vincent hasn't had a go.
it doesn't matter.
you wanted to. - It's fine, forget it.
let's get moving before the tide goes out.
Yeah, with Eric just now, it wasn't very deep.
we'll go out tomorrow. - No problem.
after 2 hours, 2 minutes won't hurt.
I wanted a drink with you guys.
let Jean-Louis drive your boat then.
alright, come on.
don't worry, it's cool.
I said I'd take you.
go on, Vincent!
go on, Dad!
Thanks, Max! - Let's clear up ready to go.
what's going on?
anything wrong?
can you all move forward?
watch out!
careful, on your left.
we're going aground.
right, Jean-Louis!
now straight ahead.
get a move on! Or we'll end up on a sand bank.
get behind me, in my wake!
let me pick up the others.
no time, you'll end up high and dry!
C'mon, let's go!
move it!
not that way, Max!
what a jerk!
wait a second!
you've run aground!
can't you give me a tow?
too late! I'll be stranded too!
just sit tight for 6 hours until the tide comes back in!
you did this on purpose. - What?
we gotta go. To get the kids back.
hold on, I'm coming!
don't jump in. - Shut up!
don't jump!
it's mud!
I'm not staying here 6 hours!
you're being ridiculous. Don't do that.
shit, I'm stuck!
watch out, you'll sink in!
listen to Jean-Louis, he knows his mud.
come on, cut the crap!
give me your hand.
give me your hand!
stop!
what's wrong? - I'm losing my shorts!
let go of me!
cute butt!
towel!
give me the towel!
you did this on purpose. - What's wrong with you?
a week ago, you say you love my hands.
now you get us stranded overnight.
no more, okay!
how could I have planned this?
2 years ago, for my coccyx, you didn't need to use your finger.
the time you stuck your finger in my ass!
there must've been another way!
stop this now... - Get away!
it wasn't my fault.
in the bow! - He told you to stay behind him.
get lost!
why didn't we ever hook up?
here we go again.
go on, tell me.
every time you get dumped...
bullshit. I haven't been dumped.
you don't fool me.
pull that with the others, not me.
I think they know anyway.
don't you wanna talk?
we can talk it over.
I look like Ludo, that's why.
C'mon, why not me?
you fuck anybody but me!
what's with you?
it's dumb, we've known each other for years.
exactly. I like it that way.
hey who's there? It's very late to be knocking...
what the hell is that? Come on!
who are you? Stop banging!
stop it! Just stop banging!
hello. - Good morning, Mak, this is your wake up call.
I had another nightmare.
how is it? Are you okay?
well, I'm fine. Just a bad dream.
how's it? Are you gonna buy me a villa?
what are you talking about? What villa? Just tell me when I see you.
okay. Nak, I love you.
Nak loves Mak too.
going to work now?
no Father, I'm meeting Nak.
here, what about your breakfast?
it's okay, I'll have breakfast with Nak.
we're going to see a house.
they serve breakfast at this house?
no Mother.
we'll probably get something to eat beforehand.
forget it!
mother? Father? Did you hear something last night?
no. Nothing.
no. Why?
it must have been nothing. See you.
Nak! Not here. It's too public.
I haven't seen you in twelve hours.
this time I saw her.
saw what?
this woman.
what woman?
in my nightmare.
her smile was black.
she had no teeth. No gums. Just shiny black.
it was very real. Very scary.
well from next week I'll be sharing the bed with you.
so this woman will have to smile at me first before she can scare you again.
maybe a change of home will improve things.
let's hope that this Estate Agent is as true as the words in his ad.

it will bring you good luck.
thank you
it is accomplished
driver stop here please.
I've got to get up early to see Master Tring.
which Master Tring?
our Fortune Teller for the wedding plans.
why don't you ask him about me and Chai?
I don't believe a word he says.
I'm only doing this for my Mom and Grandma.
Oh, C'mon! It's tradition.
I'm doing it just for you. I gotta go now.
bye bye.
Mak. Is that you Mak?
Nak, What's happened?
have you seen a ghost?
grandma, you know I don't believe in ghosts.
Kong!
Nak, aren't you scared walking through this cemetery?
I don't mind. I've been walking through this way many years.
by the way, Did you get my flowers?
I'm in a rush Kong. I don't have time to talk.
and stop sending me flowers!
don't do it Nak. Do you know you'll make a big mistake!
kong, What are you saying?
don't marry him. You can't do it.
kong, I don't care what you think.
I am going to marry Mak. I love Mak!
but I love you Nak.
good morning, Master Tring.
my Mom and Grandma asked me to tell you that we've done everything you have suggested for the wedding.
actually, it's not my suggestion.
but what the astrological readings inform us.
we must live by them.
and they will guide us to happiness and a fulfilling future.
my Mom and Grandma hope that you'll attend our reception and blessing.
I'll do my best for you, Nak.
thank you.
master Tring.
your first morning reading is waiting.
go back.
I'll leave now.
wait!
master Tring would like completion of payment today.
Yes.
what is this?
there should be another two hundred?
are you sure?
Oh I thought my Mom said...?
I don't know what your mom said but there's two hundred Baht missing.
I'm sorry.
Nak you scared me!
what are you eating?
grandma gave it to me.
it was once a very beautiful look to have many years ago.
kiss me Mak and taste some...
let me see how you look.
it's probably not good for teeth... here wash your mouth and drink some water.
Nak!
what is it Mak?
I'm okay. Just got a fright.
what was it? Can you tell me?
nothing Nak...
your Father would have loved your wedding day Nak.
I guess Mr. Preecha will go through all the paperwork within this week.
well let me know if you need more help.
yes Father.
let's hope it gets done before you go on holiday next Saturday.
krabi is such a beautiful place.
Nak, I don't know if you remember but Mak's Father and I went there three years ago.
to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.
well a toast to Mak and Nak's wedding.
and may they return to Krabi in 25 years to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Cheers!
Mak what are you doing... You'll fall.
everyone would take his wife back make love to her.
Nak!
I'm sure I locked it...
I think someone has broken in.
our stuff is missing.
look! Our wedding gifts have been stolen too.
hoping you can find our stuff soon as possible
don't worry, we tried our best
Thanks, you are welcome
what did the police say?
there's not much they can do.
except wait and see if any of the gifts turn up.
the thieves will probably try and sell our stuff on the street.
then we'd have to prove they were ours.
it's a pity. They took my wedding suit.
it had a wedding gift I bought for Nak in it.
it was an antique brooch. I would like to get that back.
will you be okay staying here tonight?
yes we'll be fine. This is our house.
what about the neighbours. Didn't they see anything?
nothing. Police spoke to them but no one saw anything.
they said nothing to see
that's crazy!
you've only got to fart where I live and a neighbour will come around to have a good sniff.
how much? I will buy all if you gave me a reasonable price
Hey!
go quickly
don't go please!
hurry up, get in!
don't let too many in
Mak. I'm here Mak...
it's Nak next to you.
can you hear me? Mak
mak... wake up and talk to me.
I'm here, Mak.
can you hear me?
Nak, Doctor has got something to...
are you Nak?
I'm Doctor Grid. You must be Mak's wife.
what happened? Why is he like this?
we know he was in a hit and run accident.
it has left Mak in a coma.
coma? When will he wake up?
it's hard to tell at this stage.
we are monitoring him for any responses.
Mak's parent just arrived.
doctor I'll go with you.
find Mae Nak.
you must find Mae Nak.
doctor, Mak spoke to me. He spoke!
are you sure that Mak spoke to you?
but the monitor shows no response at all.
he's been stable... no change at all.
you have to rest.
you have to keep your strength so you can be with Mak.
I mean it
you've been at his bedside all day.
you haven't eaten much... nothing at all.
I've made a congee for you... eat some.
here... eat Nak.
grandma! Mak said something to me this morning in hospital.
are you sure he spoke to you?
the Doctor said there was no change.
Yes, he did!
he told me to find Mae Nak.
to find Mae Nak?
but Mae Nak... is a Ghost!
ghost! What do you mean a Ghost?
what I am going to tell you is the story of Mae Nak.
over a hundred years ago, there was a young woman called Nak.
Nak married a young man named Mak.
they were very much in love.
and their marriage was a true commitment...
they were inseparable. Because they loved each other very much.
and they were blessed with conception of a child.
but then the dream was broken...
her Mak had to go to war...
Mak was seriously injured.
the monks helped him recover.
soon Mak was ready to return to his true love... his Nak.
they were together again as a family.
but then Mak noticed that things had changed.
the neighbours they knew so well had gone.
people would not stop at their house.
Mak MO feels strange, he tried to find out
but got no answer
so he goes to next village to find the answer
finally someone told MO she died in childbirth, and that she was now a ghost!
that night the GHOST OF MAE NAK had her revenge on the village.
the dead were the people that tried to take Mak away from Nak.
she would not let them.
she cursed them and stopped them.
the villagers awake Mak to face the truth about his young wife.
that she is dead and he has been living with a ghost who has struck revenge.
on those who tried to come between her and Mak...
there in the grave was the decaying body of the young Mae Nak.
Mak's wife and true love and next to her their dead child.
the Higher Dignitary performed an exorcism on Nak and her child.
they were made to rest in peace.
mae Nak no longer sought revenge on those who tried to stop her love between her and her Mak.
grandma, why did Mae Nak want revenge?
she wanted to keep the true love she had. Her love for her Mak was so overwhelming.
it became her obsession,
you're late Tick! Where have you been?
the scrap guy is waiting for you.
I know! I know! I had to go the long way round.
police are everywhere.
so you need to get to the scrap yard as soon as possible.
I'm scared Tock!
call me when it's done.
murderer! Thief!
who is this?
who are you?
where have you been?
I've been waiting for you. You're late.
here's your money.
you can go. I'll do this myself.
now all the tests show that Mak is physically normal.
but he is still in his coma.
he has no response at all.
we are going to do a brain scan today.
hopefully that will pinpoint a cause for his state.
you can buy it if you're gonna look at it that close!
where did you get this?
this was stolen from my house!
hey Tock! Come here Tock!
I'll call the police!
call the police?
take your hands out of the pocket or I'll cut it off!
look she's taken something!
Mak I went to see our Estate Lawyer, Mr. Preecha, about the house.
he had good news to tell. The house is finally ours Mak.
Mak look! I found something.
I found the brooch you brought for me.
it's so beautiful, Mak.
it feels so strange.
very cold.
mak, feel it.
Mak did you see that?
it was me and you. Our first kiss.
you are lucky Master Tring will see you at such short notice.
it must be important?
I am saddened to hear about your Mak.
but he is strong. I'm sure he'll be okay.
I'll read his chart for him and we will see a positive future.
master Tring I must ask you about another concern.
Mak told me that he was having nightmares.
and he was being haunted by a vision of a ghost woman.
and when he was in hospital, he spoke to me from his sleep.
he said "Find Mae Nak"!
what is that mean?
mae Nak is not a stuff
could you tell me?
master, please give me a direction
mae Nak? Mae Nak is a ghost.
Yes. My Grandma told me her story.
this is why I come to see you. To give me an answer.
what did they do to her?
the Higher Dignitary at that time put a stop to Mae Nak's curses and vengeance.
he exorcised her to rest in peace.
the Higher Dignitary removed a piece of bone from Mae Nak's skull.
he now had Nak's spirit held in the bone.
her grave was filled in and forgotten... Unmarked and lost in the woods and in time.
the bone was made into a brooch that the Dignitary wore until his last day.
what happened to the brooch then?
legend has it that the brooch was lost in time.
it is still out there...
but holding Nak's spirit inside.
Nak what is this!
I knew it,
I sensed something strong and evil when you entered the house.
is this the girdle brooch made from the bones of Mae Nak!
take it out! Take it out!
master! Master!
master. What is wrong? Master!
what happened?
I ask what happened?
get out! I can deal with this!
master! Master! Master!
master is well now but needs rest.
I don't understand what happened.
his strong visions overpower him controlling his body and mind.
he explained to me about the object you have.
this object is very very valuable.
and must be handled carefully.
it's extremely powerful and can cause you great harm.
so it's true? This belongs to Mae Nak!
Yes, it is. Master has asked that I take you to a Higher Dignitary to discuss the outcome of the brooch.
master does not want it to fall into wrong hands.
it will be very dangerous for you to keep.
come let's go now.
where are you going? Wait!
Mak loves Nak.
Nak loves Mak.
our love forever and ever and ever.
nobody comes here anymore.
it used to be a nursery for young children.
but they had to close it.
because of the children seeing the GHOSTS.
it was a burial ground many many years ago.
a burial ground?
kong
Nak
so, what's back there?
what do you want Kong?
I'm sorry to hear about Mak's accident.
I called your Mom to say
I er'... couldn't come to your wedding.
then she told me about Mak.
I was shocked Nak.
are you okay?
I kept thinking back to when your Father died, and you come to me.
I'm here for you Nak.
look Kong! You were not invited to my wedding.
and you have no right to call my Mom.
I told you leave me alone! Don't you understand?
if Mak doesn't survive, if he dies, then you will be alone.
but I'll still be here for you.
forget Mak.
get off!
our love forever and ever and ever.
Nak
Mak's Mother and Father have arranged for a Monk to come and pray for Mak.
it will give him strength.
Noi. Chai.
I need your help.
I want to explain something to you.
I believe that the old nursery is the burial place of Mae Nak.
somehow she connected with Mak through his dreams and was trying to tell him something.
tell him something?
I think she wants to be at peace.
we have to return what is hers.
and how do we do that?
we dig.
we dig and find the remains of Mae Nak.
Nak are you sure no one owns this place?
I've checked. We're okay.
but I think we should speak to the Police first.
and tell them what? That we are digging for a ghost!
there!
we have to dig here!
why there Nak? Why do we have to dig there?
okay! But if we don't find anything after thirty minutes, then we go home.
okay, but now we have to dig.
let's dig it!
some water for you Chai?
C'mon Chai you've done enough. Let's go home now... Chai?
Gotta' dig! The ground's so hard...
gotta keep digging! The ground is so...
this is a bone!
it was a baby!
why is it buried here?
now we have to call the Police!
no we can't... Not now... we need to keep digging.
Nak we can't. This needs a serious police investigation.
we have to call them.
hello Mom! What is it?
yes I'm with Chai and Noi.
we'll be there right away.
something very serious has happened to Mak. We've got to go to the hospital now.
let's go now.
what's about this?
let's find something to cover it.
Nak, What have you been doing?
we've been working on the house.
this is the brain scan of Mak.
we are concerned that there may be injuries to the brain.
such as a hemorrhage, that we cannot detect.
so we are going to do intensive tests.
it will show signs of damage to the brain.
we are treating this as an emergency procedure and we want to start tonight.
we are worried that Mak's brain might be permanently damaged...
Mak
Mak
Mak
can you hear me Mak?
what would happen such phenomenon?
shocking treatment ready ready go home now!
I won't go! Let us go!
mae Nak!
mae Nak!
I was worried about you Nak. I had to call the police.
don't worry Nak I told them I'll help you.
come back to my place.
Nak!
grandma
I don't understand.
why doesn't Mae Nak release my Mak?
why Grandma?
I will take you to someone who can help.
legend says that the spirit of Mae Nak was very revengeful on those who tried to stop her love.
she will do them great harm.
how do you do!
Hi!
how are you feeling Nak?
much better now thanks.
it was a difficult night for us all last night.
where is Mak now?
he is in safe hands now.
he was taken to a monastery where they will help him.
the monks will remove the spirit that possesses him.
we have given them our permission for an exorcism.
Mrs. Grimm?
are you there?
I have brought my granddaughter Nak here.
she needs your help.
who is it?
can't you remember my voice?
Yes. Come in, come inside.
how wonderful it is to have you visit us with your grandmother.
so you must be Nak?
I remember you when you were a little girl.
and I remember her grandmother when she was a young girl.
Oh don't talk about such ancient times.
may I touch your face Nak?
it's how Mrs. Grimm sees you.
Yes, of course.
there now I can see you Nak. You are very beautiful.
now let's find out how we can help you young Nak.
come inside the house.
Mrs. Grimm is tuning into the spirit world.
she has been a spiritualist all her life.
Oh I nearly forget... This may help.
Nak was holding it all last night.
Ah! Wonderful!
let Mrs. Grimm hold it. It may help.
you are surrounded by pure love, young Nak.
the presence that this belongs to is reading out to you through this pure love.
the presence is a woman.
a woman who is not at peace.
who cannot rest.
the presence is with us.
she's here with us.
we sense that you are with us here.
will you talk to us? Yes or no?
will you communicate with us? Yes or no?
we are here to help you.
sure
what is your name?
do we know you?
are you connected to us? Yes or no?
no.
what is your name?
mae Nak.
mae Nak.
is there someone here you wish to communicate with?
will you tell us why you are not at rest?
speak to Nak. Nak is with us here.
what do you want of Nak?
Nak. Help me.
help me.
why do you feel no peace?
what help do you need?
speak to Nak. Nak is with us.
release me.
release me. Release me!
release me. Release me!
the spirit of Mae Nak has been awoken by the true love that you and your Mak have for each other.
it is the love that she once had and misses deeply.
I did everything I could.
I searched until I found her.
and you must continue young Nak.
but what does she want?
you must return what belongs to Mae Nak.
Nak, I must warn you that your Mak is in great danger.
your grandmother told me about the exorcism they plan to do on Mak tonight.
they will do him great harm.
you must stop them Nak.
Nak, what are you doing here?
Chai, I need your help.
I need to go to the Police morgue.
you're going to create serious problems for yourself you know.
please Chai you must help me. This will be the last time I promise.
look Nak this whole thing has caused a strain between Noi and I.
noi is worried I may lose my job.
Chai, I just need you to help me get inside the Police morgue, that's all.
I have to help Mak.
Mak is in good hands now.
the monks are taking care of him.
you'll make things worse for him.
Chai you must help me.
if you don't help me Chai you could be in danger too.
mae Nak can do strange things.
Nak. Stop it. Enough talk about ghosts and bones and such crazy nonsense!
Nak!
touch this.
you'll be in great danger Chai.
mae Nak won't let anyone stop her.
happy now?
okay Nak I'm going to drive you home.
and then I'll have some explaining to Noi because I'll be late and...
which department you belong to?
I work in the pay-roll department.
I need to collect the job sheets.
they were meant to be sent over today.
so I came over myself. On my way home.
you guys need to get paid this month right?
okay.
Thanks.
quickly Nak. Get under here.
you might need this flashlight inside.
hey where are you taking that?
it was blocking the entrance.
I'm just returning it.
returning it? Returning it where?
that's my job.
Hello? Yeah. Where are you?
I can't come. I'm working tonight.
have a guess who I'm with.
that man who got sliced in two by glass.
it's been mad busy all week.
we've got that train guy in too. Lost his head. Clean off.
our love for ever and ever.
and look after each other forever.
I've done everything you want me to do.
now you give back Mak to me.
give my Mak back to me!
thank you!
mae Nak can rest in peach now.
they say that this temple is also the resting place of her Mak.
he is telling you that we will burn the coffin tonight.
this will complete the religious ceremony.
everything's all done now.
now you'll be happy together.
Nak, come and look at this photo.
Mak.
come and be with me Mak.
No! I'm not your Mak.
don't you remember me Mak?
where is Nak?
where is my wife?
mae Nak...
I'm not your Mak.
give me back my wife.
please Mae Nak!
give me back my wife.
Chai... I need to borrow your car.
no time to explain!
help me please!
Nak!
mak!
please help me!
Mak
help me. There's somebody in here!
mak! Help me.
Nak!
mother, what are you...
I thought you were a burglar.
I didn't mean to scare you, darling,
I was just getting a snack.
go back to bed.
what's the matter?
go on, back to bed.
I'll make you hot chocolate.
who are you?
and what have you done with my mother?
my mother has never set foot in this kitchen in her life.
and she certainly wouldn't get me hot chocolate.
unless she kept ordering me to do it.
you're not scared of me?
I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world.
the only person who is different.
and here you are, Charles Xavier.
raven.
you're hungry, and alone?
take whatever you want.
we've got lots of food, you don't have to steal.
in fact...
...you never have to steal again.
understand this, Erik.
these Nazi's, I'm not like them.
genes are the key, yes...
but their goals?
blue eyes, Blond hair, Pathetic.
eat the chocolate.
it's good.
want some?
I want to see my Mama.
genes are the keys that unlocks the door to a new age, Erik.
a new future for mankind.
evolution.
you know what I'm talking about?
it's a simple thing I ask of you.
a little coin is nothing compared to a big gate.
is it?
I tried, Herr Doctor...
I can't... I don't...
it's impossible.
the one thing I can say for the Nazi's, is their methods seem to produce results.
I'm sorry, Erik.
mama!
my darling.
how are you?
here's what we're going to do.
I'm going to count to three...
...and you're going to move the coin.
you don't move the coin, I pull the trigger.
understand?
one...
mama! - You can do it.
two...
everything is all right.
everything is all right.
everything is all right!
three.
Yes, wonderful!
Excellent!
outstanding, Erik!
so we unlock you're gift with anger.
anger and pain.
you and me, we're going to have a lot of fun together.
Hetero-chromia.
a gentlemen would at least offer to buy me a drink first.
Newman, a pint of bitter for me and a brandy for the lady, please.
how did you know that? - Lucky guess.
the name's, Xavier, Charles Xavier.
how do you do... - Amy.
Heterochromia, is reference to your eyes, which I have to say are stunning.
one green, one blue. It's a mutation.
it's a very groovy mutation.
I have news for you, Amy. You are a mutant.
first you proposition a girl, and then you call her deformed.
how is that seduction tactic working for you?
I'll tell you in the morning.
no, no.
seriously, you must knock it.
mutation's go from single cell organisms to being the dominate form of reproductive life.
on this planet, infinite forms of variations with each generation all through mutation.
then let's reclaim that word.
mutant, and proud. - Chin, chin, hey.
Hi, I guess I have to buy my own drink.
I'm sorry, one cola.
Charles here was just telling me that I'm like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs.
tiny bit sexier.
I'm sorry, this is my sister, Raven.
Hi, Amy. - And what do you study?
waitressing.
Oh look, you have hetero-chromia too!
say, what? - Look at her eye...
right, Raven get your coat please.
don't talk to me, you did that on purpose.
I did not! - Yes you did!
why would I do it on purpose?
you know I can't control it sometimes.
when I'm stressed or tired.
you seem to be doing a perfectly good job right now.
mutant and proud
why is it always the pretty mutations, or the invisible ones like yours.
if you're a freak, better hide.
you're being ridiculous!
look, I don't mean to sound like an old fart.
which you are.
sometimes, but we've talked about this, Raven.
a small slip up is one thing.
a big one does not bear thinking about.
mutant and proud
mutant and proud?
if only...
would you date me? - Of course I would.
any man would be lucky to have you.
you're stunning! - Looking like this?
like, you...what?
blue?
you're my oldest friend. - I'm your only friend.
thank you for that.
well?
I'm incapable of even thinking of you like that,
I feel responsible for you.
anything else would just feel wrong.
but what if you didn't know me?
unfortunately I do know you.
I don't know what's got into you lately?
you're awfully concerned with your looks.
I'm sleepy. Will you read to me?
I can't, I have my thesis coming up, I have to study.
well fine, read about your thesis it always sends me right off.
to Homo neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin Homo sapiens, was an aberration.
peaceful co-habitation, if ever it existed, was short lived.
records show, without exception that the arrival of the mutated human species in any region was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.
possession of that gold is illegal.
I should inform the police. - Let's not play this game.
where did you get it? - A Friend.
he recommended your bank, most highly.
I see.
do you know our terms, sir?
Yes.
and you should know mine.
this gold is what remains of my people.
melted from their possessions. Torn from their teeth.
this is blood money.
and you're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it.
don't touch that alarm.
I want Schmidt, Klaus Schmidt.
where is he?
our clients don't supply addresses, we're not...
not that sort of bank?
metal fillings, eh, not gold.
worried someone might steal them?
argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina!
villa Gesell! Please, please!
thank you.
I would love to kill you.
so mark my words, if you warn anyone, I'm coming...
...I will find you.
another day at the office.
is that Colonel Hendry?
the NATO guy? - Yeah.
Yes, it is.
cause that's three mob bosses, the Italian ambassador, the CEO of Lockheed.
they can't all be communists.
this Hellfire club's gotta be something else.
do you see that? Hello, girls!
wow, very nice.
wha...what are you doing?
here's things that the CIA didn't give me.
stay put.
Colonel Hendry? - Yes, ma'am.
Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw's associate.
and where is, Mr. Shaw?
we're having a party, and here's the entertainment.
come with me.
hello beautiful, how are you?
hey baby, you want to find a quiet place?
I am so sorry. I've been booked by Colonel Hendry.
excuse me.
are you sure we can't get a refill, Bob? - No.
so, I hear you blocked the proposal to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.
I expect you to reconsider.
we've had this conversation.
you put our nukes in Turkey, or anywhere that close to Russia, and you're looking at war. Nuclear war.
I didn't ask for favors, Colonel.
I express my expectations.
so, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.
the only thing I will reconsider, is having another glass of that delicious champagne.
what the hell did you put in my drink?
you're thinking of running, hiding?
we'd find you, Hendry.
there's not a fortress in the world that can keep us out.
magnificent, isn't she, Bob?
genetic mutation, the evolution of the human genome.
Where's Azazel?
Ah, we don't want the Colonel to be late.
come here.
missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.
we ever decided to fire them, the Russians early warning system won't even have time to kick in.
this better be important, MacTaggert
whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
you smoking them funny cigarettes?
people don't disappear.
Colonel Hendry was there.
he was there, McCone, in the Hellfire club.
Colonel Hendry?
I agree with you, General. I've reconsidered my position.
and I now believe that we should put Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.
Colonel Hendry is here.
so, unless he magically traveled 3, 000 miles in the last ten minutes,
listen to me, I suggest that you stop wasting my time.
looks like Hendry wants to start World War III.
I have better things to deal with right now, MacTaggert.
sir, I...!
have you lost your mind?
so, now what?
we find an expert on Genetic Mutation.
professor of genetics, Charles Francis Xavier.
so, how does it feel to be a professor?
well, ah, don't call me that.
you don't get to be called a Professor until you actually have a teaching position.
I know, but it suits you.
no, don't say that, do say "Let's go have a drink."
let's go have a drink. - Wonderful!
good evening, my friends! - Good evening!
hot, no? - Yes...
one beer, please.
german beer? - Of course.
Yes, it's Bitburger. You like it?
the best.
what brings you to Argentina?
the climate, I'm a pig farmer.
tailor, since I was a boy.
my father made the finest suits in Dusseldorf.
my Parents were from, Dusseldorf.
what was their name? - They didn't have a name.
it was taken away from them...
...By pig farmers...
...and tailors.
blood and Honor.
which would you care to shed first?
we were under orders. - Blood then.
freeze, asshole! - Come on, shoot!
who, what are you?
let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster.
I'm looking for my creator.
drink, drink, drink!
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
I need another drink, and you need another cola - Congratulations, Professor! - Thank you very much, it's much harder than it looks, actually.
no, on your presentation.
you knew my presentation?
how nice of you, thank you very much.
Moira MacTaggert.
Charles Xavier.
do you have a minute?
for a pretty little beam with a mutated MCR-1 gene, I have five.
I say, MCR-1, you would say, golden hair.
it's a mutation, it's a very groovy mutation.
mutation you know, took us from single cell organisms, to the dominate form...
you know what, this routine may go over great with the co-eds, but I'm here on business.
what?
I really need your help.
all right.
the kind that of mutations that you were talking about in your thesis
I need to know if they may already have happened.
in people alive today.
professor?
I think that we should just talk when you're sober.
do you have any time tomorrow?
something tells me, you already know the answer to your question.
this is very important to me.
and if I can help you, I will do my utmost.
thank you.
still drinking champagne, Bob?
I will pass.
okay, well so much for the pleasantries.
I was wondering, who you told about our little arrangement?
no one.
he's telling the truth.
good.
well I guess we're done here.
let's wrap things up, shall we?
well I knew better than to trust you.
now you let me walk out of here with my money.
or I will pull this pin and we all die.
go ahead, pull it.
I'll do it, I swear to god.
no you won't.
but I will.
you're one of them?
very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
you want to guess what I can do?
I've got the power to absorb energy.
it keeps me young.
that's the boring part.
the fun stuff is what I can do with it once I got it.
the advent of the nuclear age, may have accelerated the mutation process.
individual's with extraordinary abilities may already be among us.
thank you very much.
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist is going to make me believe in sparkly dames and vanishing men?
you just brought yourself a one way ticket back to the typing pool.
this meeting is over.
uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.
I didn't really expect you to believe me.
given that all you could think about during my presentation, was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.
it's apple pecan.
I haven't been entirely honest with you, and I'm sorry.
you see, one of the many spectacular things my mutation allows me to do, is that I can read your mind.
I've seen this before in a magic show.
are you going to ask us to think of a number between one and ten now?
no, agent Stryker.
although I could ask you about your son William who you were thinking about, which is very nice.
but I think I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.
he's a goddamn spy!
you brought a goddamn spy!
I did not, I would never bring one here!
how's that for a magic trick?
best I've ever seen.
I want them out of here.
and lock down until I can figure out what to do.
my facility is off site. I'll take them.
I can't believe this.
you'd think the director of the CIA would have a little more composure.
we should be going after Shaw right now, but instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.
what are we doing to do, Lavene?
Lavene? Lavene, what's wrong with you?
absolutely nothing,
I've just frozen him for the moment because I'd like to talk to you.
it's good, isn't it?
I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are,
and if you still want my help, meet me on the third floor of the parking garage.
I've always known that there were people like you out there.
I've been the laughing stock of this agency for years but I knew it.
you're going to love my facility.
that's going to have to wait.
Why?
agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw, and if we don't move now apparently we're going to lose him.
what?
not only can he read minds, he can communicate with them as well.
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.
Yes, we did.
that is incredible!
but I cannot take you anywhere else, without permission from upstairs.
would you like to see one more magic trick?
okay.
get in the car.
good idea.
Herr Doctor.
little Erik Lensherr.
he's here to kill you.
what kind of greeting is that?
after all these years?
Emma.
we don't harm our own kind.
Ah, now it's a party.
this is the US Coast guard.
do not attempt to move your vessel.
stay where you are.
they have a telepath.
I've lost, Shaw!
I've lost, I've lost, Shaw.
there's, there's something blocking me.
this has never happened to me before.
I think there's someone like me on that ship.
like you?
I'm sorry, a telepath.
this is incredible,
I can actually feel her inside my mind.
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm going to be much help to you tonight.
you're on your own.
Oh my god. - Jesus.
get inside.
stop, stop, stop!
Charles! You okay?
there's someone else out there.
there!
time to go.
let go!
better let it go!
you've got help him...
there's someone in the water, help him!
let it go! You have to let it go!
you can't, you'll drown. You have to let go.
I know what this means to you but you're going to die.
please, Erik, calm your mind.
get off of me, get off!
calm down, please. - We're here!
who are you?
professor Charles Xavier.
you were in my head.
how did you do that?
you have your tricks, I have mine.
I'm like you, just calm your mind.
I thought I was alone. - You're not alone.
Erik, you're not alone.
welcome to my facility.
my mission has been to investigate the application of paranormal powers for military defense or offense.
this guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever you want to call him.
he's working with the Russians.
we might need your help to stop them.
marvelous.
so we're to be the CIA's new mutant division, yes?
something like that.
it's a supersonic. The most advanced plane ever built.
you should see it in real life.
it's incredible.
Hank, these are the special new recruits I was telling you about.
this is, Hank McCoy, one of our most talented young researchers.
how wonderful, another mutant. Already here.
why didn't you say?
say what?
because you don't know.
I am so, so terribly sorry!
Hank?
you didn't ask, so I didn't tell.
so your mutation's what? You're super smart?
I'll say, Hank here graduated honors at the age of fifteen.
I wish that's all it was.
you're among friends now, Hank.
you could show off.
splendid.
sorry. - Yes, yes.
you're amazing.
Really?
the presence of U. S. Missiles in Turkey represents an unprecedented threat to the people of the Soviet Union warned Russian Mister Gromeko, earlier today.
but he was quick to insist the Russians would not be the first to initiate any military action.
Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as we get to Russia.
unless the CIA finds us first.
I'll take care of them too.
if that telepath gets inside your head, he won't be as much fun as I am.
already in hand, my love.
the Russians made me this.
so, what am I thinking?
I don't know.
I was thinking that you are the most exquisite thing that I've ever seen in my life.
and that this needs ice.
fetch me some.
there's a good girl.
I, I promised myself I'd find a cure, ever since I was a little boy.
you have no idea what I'd give to feel...
normal. - Normal.
Charles has never understood.
he's different, but he's never had to hide.
it doesn't affect abilities, right?
just appearance. Normalizes it.
Yeah.
do you think it would work on me?
I can look into it, if you'd like.
that's the least I can do after asking you to come down here to listen to a weird request.
I have to admit, usually when guys ask me out they're not after my blood.
sorry, I didn't intend to be forward.
I was just...I was excited.
you know, the nature of your mutation.
if any genes hold the key to changing appearance, it's yours.
Hank, you aren't being forward, that's kinda what I meant.
no, but I'm just sorry if you thought I was.
and I'm sorry that you weren't.
go ahead, take the blood.
sorry, did I hurt you?
kinky!
by the way, if I looked like you, I wouldn't change a thing.
what I know about you,
I'm surprised you managed to stay this long.
what do you know about me? - Everything.
then know to stay out of my head.
I'm sorry Erik, but I've seen what Shaw did to you.
I felt your agony.
I can help you.
I don't need your help.
don't kid yourself. You needed my help last night.
it's not just me you're walking away from.
here you have the chance to be a part of something much bigger than yourself.
I won't stop you leaving,
I could.
but I won't.
Shaw's got friends.
you could do with some.
Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter.
it's designed to amplify brain waves, so it could enhance your telepathic powers.
help us find other mutants for our division.
I thought they'd all been found by you.
Erik!
you decided to stay.
if a new species is being discovered, it should be by its own kind.
Charles and I find the new mutants, no suits.
first of all, that's my machine out there.
second of all, and much more importantly, this is Charles' decision.
Charles is fine with the CIA being involved. Isn't that right?
no, I'm sorry but, I'm with Erik.
we'll find them alone.
what if I say no?
then good luck using your installation without me.
I call it, Cerebro.
isn't that Spanish for "Brain"? - Yes.
okay so, the electrodes connect Charles to the transmitter on the roof.
and picks up a mutant.
his brain sends a signal through a relay.
and then the co-ordinates of their location are printed out here.
you designed this?
Yeah.
what an adorable lab rat you make, Charles.
don't spoil this for me, Erik.
I've been a lab rat,
I know one when I see one.
okay, right
are you sure we can't shave your head?
don't touch my hair.
it's working!
with that Daddy-O, you get a private dance.
you cat's know it's double for both, right?
no, that won't be necessary. Although I sure we...
we were thinking more, we're show you ours, ...if you show us yours.
baby, that is not the way it works around here.
more tea, Vicar? - Don't mind if I do.
my turn.
how would you like a job, where you get to keep your clothes on?
where to fellas? - Richmond, Virginia.
right, so you want the airport, the station, what?
no, we were rather hoping that you would take us all the way.
that's a six hour drive.
that will give us plenty of time to talk.
what the hell does the government want with a guy like, Alex Summers?
I hope you don't plan on putting him with others.
first guy I ever met who actually prefers solitary confinement.
crazy, huh? - What?
you like fish, I like fish too.
maybe we should bide some time and talk about it.
I'd rather go out with the fish.
these fish?
excuse me I'm Erik Lensher. - Charles Xavier.
go fuck yourselves.
there's nothing on radar? - No.
sonar? - No.
then we have a problem.
beautiful, isn't it?
the reason we exist. We are the children of the atom, my love.
we have a situation.
the telepath...
I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance.
it's like his reach is...
...amplified.
they're recruiting.
you go on to Russia, I'll handle him.
I can't stop thinking about the others out there.
all those minds that I've touched.
I could feel them, their aspirations, their hopes, their ambitions.
I tell you, we've started something incredible, Erik.
we can help them. - Can we?
identification, that's how it starts.
then ends with being rounded up. Experimented on, eliminated.
I know the story.
we have common enemies, Shaw and the Russians they need us.
for now.
we should think of code names.
we're government agents now, we should have secret code names.
I want to be called, Mystique.
damn, I wanted to be called, Mystique.
well tough, I called it.
damn wang, mysterious to you.
darwin, what about you?
well, uh, Darwin's already a nickname.
and you know, sort of fits. Adapt to survive and all.
check this out.
thank you, thank you. - Bravo, bravo.
what about you? - I'm going to be...
...Banshee.
why do you want to be names after a wailing spirit?
you might want to cover your ears.
your turn.
my stage name is Angel. Kind of fits.
you can fly? - Ah, hah. And uh...
what's your name? - How about Big Foot?
well you know what they say about guys with big feet?
and uh, yours are kind of small.
okay, now.
Alex, what is your gift? What can you do?
uh, it's not um, I just can't do it.
I can't do it in here. - Can you do it out there?
why don't you just do it out there. - Come on. Come on, Alex.
Alex! Alex!
that's the spirit.
get down when I tell you.
get back.
get back!
whatever...
we've got Intel that Shaw is meeting with the Russian defense chief in Moscow.
so go ahead, say it.
I'm not here to say "I told you so," you know why I'm here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring along your mutants.
fight fire with fire.
makes sense.
wait, you're okay with this?
sending in a bunch of untrained unauthorized freaks?
these "Freaks" are dedicated hard working people.
plane leaves for Russia in an hour.
I'm telling you these kids are not ready for, Shaw.
I think they're going to surprise you.
they are an exceptional bunch of young people.
what the hell?
harder!
harder!
what are you doing?
who destroyed the statue? - It was, Alex.
no Havok! We have to call him, Havok. That's his name now.
and we were thinking, you should be, Professor X
and you should be, Magneto.
exceptional.
I expect more from you.
we got a problem.
what? - I'm so sorry, this wasn't on the map.
no matter what happens, act normally.
I'll take care of this, all right.
now listen to me.
where are you going?
to our farm.
open the back.
as you wish, as you wish.
Oh, easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps.
anything back there?
nothing, it's empty.
everything's okay? - Yes.
Where's Shaw? - Emma.
she's a telepath, if I read her, she'll know we're here.
let me try something else.
Shaw sends his apologies, but he's indisposed.
he asked me to come in his place.
but between you and I honey, I'm a lot better company.
please come in.
he's not coming.
so, what now boss? - Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw.
mission aborted. - The hell it is.
Erik. - She's his right hand woman.
that's good enough for me.
the CIA invading the home of a senior Soviet official.
are you crazy? - I'm not CIA.
Erik!
to your health.
so you must be busy planning your next move.
what with the American's refusing to remove their missiles from Turkey.
you know I can't talk about those things, Miss Frost.
Emma.
and don't worry, you don't have to say a word.
he's going to start world war III single handed.
we have to do something. - Like what?
we're moving out. - You can't.
I'm sorry, I can't leave him.
for goodness sake, Erik...
be calm.
be calm. Forget my face. Yes.
you're beautiful, so beautiful...yes.
pathetic.
nice trick.
who are you?
go to sleep.
you can stop trying to read my mind, sugar.
you're never going to get anything from me while I'm like this.
so then you can just tell us.
where is Shaw?
Erik.
Erik, that's enough.
Erik, that's enough!
all yours.
she won't be shifting into diamond form again.
but if she does, just give her a gentle tap.
we are the children of the atom.
radiation gave birth to mutants.
what will kill the humans, will only make us stronger.
beautiful, isn't it?
this is worse that we previously imagined.
we're taking you with us.
CIA will want to question you themselves. - I doubt it.
might be other things to worry about right now.
whoa, all right.
Jesus, man you are killing me.
don't beat yourself up, we got a lot of spare time.
Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town.
hey come on honey, give us a little, uh...
no? Come on, let's see the foot.
there it is, come on Bigfoot. let's go.
Hey, hey come on, hey.
they're just guys being stupid.
guy's being stupid I can handle. I can handle that my whole life.
but I'd rather have a bunch of guys staring at me with my clothes off, then the way these one stare at me.
at us.
what was that?
I don't know, but something doesn't feel right.
no news of Shaw? - Not a peep, nothing through that back channel.
what is that?
we have an intruder on the main atrium.
where are the mutants?
take another step, I'm going to put you down.
of course you will, but where do I find the more evolved people?
send back-up now!
get back, get back, do not leave that room. We're under attack.
look out! - Shoot it, shoot it!
where are the mutants?
put that man down or we will open fire.
stay here my ass. Let's go!
get back! - We can help, we can help!
wait, wait, you want the mutants?
they're right through that door.
just let us normal people go.
we're no...
Where's the telepath?
not here. - Too bad.
now I can take this silly thing off.
good evening My name is, Sebastian Shaw.
and I am not here to hurt you.
Freeze!
Azazel...
my friends, there's a revolution coming.
when mankind discovers who we are, what we can do.
each of us will face a choice.
be enslaved, or rise up to rule.
choose freely, but know that if you are not with us, then by definition you are against us.
so, you can stay, and fight for the people who hate, and fear you.
or you can join me. And live like kings.
and Queens.
angel? - Are you kidding me?
come on, we don't belong here.
and that's nothing to be ashamed of.
we have to do something.
stop, I'm coming with you.
good choice.
so tell me about your mutation.
well, I adapt to survive.
so I guess I'm coming with you. - I like that.
Alex, do it! - Get down!
protecting your fellow, mutants?
it's a noble gesture. Feels good.
adapt to this.
hello.
once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA.
these American's are ruthless.
now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.
I expect you'll be planning new missile sites of your own.
somewhere where you know the American early warning system won't help.
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.
and so close to Florida.
missiles in Cuba?
you're serious?
we may as well declare war.
maybe I wasn't clear enough.
you will make this happen.
okay.
let's see what KGB think about this.
Hello, General Armivolkoff.
it's nothing.
raven.
we've made arrangements for you to be taken home immediately.
we're not going home. - What?
he's not going back to prison. - They killed Darwin.
all the more reason for you to leave.
this is over.
darwin is dead, Charles. And we can't even bury him.
we can avenge him.
Erik, word please.
they're just kids. - No, they were kids.
Shaw has his army, we need ours.
we'll have to train. All of us.
yes? - Yeah.
well we can't stay here.
even if they reopen the department, it's not safe.
we've got nowhere to go.
Yes, we do.
the law says we've got to turn her over.
the law applies to human beings.
the same laws don't apply to mutants. They're too dangerous.
times like this, security is more important than liberty.
there's a war coming, John. - Yes, but a war with who?
excellent question.
though I won't call it a war exactly.
that suggests both sides stand an equal chance of winning.
captain, no sign of any American ships.
maintain course, full ahead.
the Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba.
we have a week before their ship hits the coast.
our fleet can be on this line, when the Russian missile ship arrives.
if that ship crosses the line, they will have declared war against the United States.
we will have no choice but to retaliate with a full nuclear response.
do we agree?
dispatch the Seventh fleet.
this is yours? - No, it's ours.
honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.
living in such hardship.
well it was a hardship softened by me.
come on, time for the tour.
dear comrades.
the United States have dispatched war ships for Cuba.
this leaves us with no choice.
comrade First Secretary.
we must send in our fleet.
dispatch the fleet!
president Kennedy has signed a formal proclamation.
setting up a blockade of all missiles, armed for Cuba.
the Soviet Union reacted by terming it as step along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war.
you're sure? - I'm sure.
hold it.
no, I can't. I'm sorry.
I can't shoot anybody point blank, let alone my friend.
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.
you're always telling me I should push myself.
if you know you can deflect it, then you're not challenging yourself.
what ever happened to the man who was trying to raise a submarine?
what, I can't.
something that big, I need the situation, the anger.
no, the anger isn't enough.
it's gotten the job done all this time.
it's nearly gotten you killed all this time.
Hey, come here.
let's try something a little more challenging.
my step-father took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously.
this way.
that's why he had this bunker built down here.
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.
you don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?
no, he had this place built to with stand a nuclear bomb.
I think it can handle you, Alex.
you know when I do this, bad things tend to happen.
it's because you can't control it.
it controls you.
that's why we're here, Alex. To start your training.
what you're doing is incredible.
you're hitting a pitch sound that at the same resonate frequency of the glass.
that's why it shatters.
this is like any other muscle in the body.
you can control it.
in each of us, two natures are at war.
robert Louis Stevenson, "Jekyll and Hyde."
top marks.
still it really wasn't really about good and evil. Was it, Hank.
it was about man's animal nature, and his struggle to control it.
to conform.
it is that struggle which is holding you back.
jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.
you are too.
if you're serious about me doing this, you might want to get back.
of course, should I shut the door? - Yeah.
whenever you're ready.
my god.
I will teach you to control this, Alex.
you're sure that this will work.
anything is possible. I based the design......
Hank, stop talking. Come on.
now remember, scream as hard as you can.
you need the sound waves to be supersonic.
catch them at the right angle, and they should carry you.
"they should carry me." That's reassuring.
good luck.
and don't forget to scream.
if you want to beat me this time, you have to set the beast free.
on your marks, get set...GO!
Oh, congratulations, my friend.
robert Louis Stevenson would have been proud.
impressive, Hank.
feet like those, all you need is a red nose.
right, Bozo?
I'm done here.
thank you, Alex
come on, Hank.
if you're using half the concentration to look normal.
then you're only half paying attention to whatever else you do.
just pointing out something that could save your life.
you want society to accept you.
but you can't even accept yourself.
sexy.
this is just the prototype.
the real will look considerably better, it'll be a whole suit.
see these sensors measure your energy output, this panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed.
all right try hitting the one in the middle, just the one in the middle, mind.
good luck.
you ought to see this.
your genes are extraordinary, you know that.
your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.
when you're forty you will still have the looks of a teenager.
you have the most incredible cellular structure I've ever seen.
you truly believe I'll fly this time?
unreservedly.
I trust you. - The task.
I don't trust him. - Say nothing.
I'm going to die!
all right, look, we're not going to make you do anything that your not so...
here, let me help him. - Erik!
what?
you know you were thinking the same.
wonderful work Hank, thank you very much.
all right, Alex, I want you to hit the X.
and try not to hit me, there's a good chap.
you're serious? - I'm very serious.
I have complete and utter faith in you.
am I still a Bozo?
Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.
but nice job.
see that?
try turning it to face us.
you know, I believe the true focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity.
would you mind, if I...?
what did you just do to me?
I accessed the brightest corner of your memory system.
it's a very beautiful memory, Erik, thank you.
I didn't know I still had that.
there's so much more to you than you know.
not just pain, and anger.
there's good too, I felt it.
and when you can access all that.
you will possess a power no one can match.
not even me.
so, come on. Try again.
well done.
the President is about to make his address.
it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile, ...crossing the embargo line, that surrounds Cuba, as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States.
requiring a full retaliatory response, upon the Soviet Union.
that's where we're going to find Shaw. - How do you know?
two super powers facing off, and he want's to start world war III.
he won't leave anything to chance.
so much for diplomacy.
I suggest you all get a good nights sleep.
...Ultimately leads to war.
tensions mount as the Soviet Missile ship nears Cuba.
all diplomatic efforts to avert Nuclear war have thus far failed.
as the American people ready themselves, for the likelihood of an atomic attack.
there are widespread reports of panic wide.
supermarkets cleared.
as shelters unused since the second world war, are stocked for what may lie ahead.
in all its history, American has never faced a greater threat.
the world is primed for war. And there's no one to stop me.
come in.
got a surprise for you.
I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.
the serum works like an anti-biotic.
attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.
it won't affect your abilities, just your appearance.
do you still want to do this?
should we have to hide?
you already do.
you're hiding right now. Like I have my whole life.
I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.
I just want to look... - ...normal.
Yeah.
Hank, don't.
you're beautiful, Hank.
everything you are, you're perfect.
look at all of us. Look at all we've achieved this week.
all we will achieve.
we are different.
but we shouldn't be trying to fit into society.
society should inspire and be more like us.
mutant, and proud.
it behooves me to tell you, but even if we save the world tomorrow.
and mutants are accepted into society.
my feet and your natural blue form.
will never be deemed beautiful.
you look beautiful now.
we need this cure.
Cuba, Russia, America, makes no difference.
Shaw's declared war on mankind, on all of us.
he has to be stopped.
I'm not gonna stop Shaw.
I'm gonna kill him.
do you have it into all of that?
you've known that all along why I was here, Charles.
but things have changed.
what started as a covert mission, ...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.
Shaw, us... they won't differentiate.
they'll fear us, and that fear will turn to hatred.
not if we stop a war. Not if we can prevent Shaw.
not if we risk our lives doing so.
would they do the same for us?
we have it in us to be the better man.
we already are.
we're the next stage of human evolution.
you said it yourself. - Enough.
are you really so naive as to think they won't battle their own extinction?
or is it arrogance? - I'm sorry.
after tomorrow they're going to turn on us.
and you're blind to it, because you believe they're all like Moira.
and you believe they're all like Shaw.
listen to me, very carefully my friend.
killing Shaw will not bring you peace.
peace was never an option.
no.
no.
well...
this is a surprise.
the nice kind?
no, Raven, why don't you go to bed.
maybe in a few years.
how about now?
I prefer the real Raven.
I said the real, Raven.
perfection.
could you pass me my robe? - You don't have to hide.
have you ever looked at a tiger, and thought you'd want to cover it up?
no, but...
you're an exquisite creature, Raven.
only in life the world tries to tame you.
it's time for you to be free.
you know sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if you hadn't found me here that night.
Fairable, E.Gah...ah.
for god's sake, Raven!
where are your clothes? Put some, put some clothes on.
that's not what you said when you first saw me.
but I guess pets are always cuter when they're little, right?
raven, I don't know what's got into you lately.
I thought you'd be in a good mood.
Hank tells me he's found the answer to your cosmetic problem.
you going to tell me what's the matter?
or will I have to read your mind?
you promised me you would never do that.
until recently, I never had to use my powers to know what you were thinking, Raven.
you know Charles, I used to think it was gonna be you and me against the world.
and no matter how bad the world gets, you don't want to be against it, do you?
you want to be a part of it.
what the hell happened here?
Hank has been busy.
do we really have to wear these?
as none of us has mutated to endure extreme G force, or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up.
Where's Hank?
I'm here.
Hank?
it didn't attack the cells.
it enhanced them.
it didn't work.
Yes, it did, Hank.
don't you see? This is who you were meant to be.
this is you.
no more hiding.
never looked better, man.
Hank!
don't mock me.
Hank, put him down immediately, please.
Hank...HANK!
I wasn't.
even I got to admit, you look pretty bad ass.
I think I got a new name for you, Beast.
you sure you can fly this thing?
of course I can, I designed it.
status of the cargo ship?
bearing 1-8-0, 12 knots.
three minutes to the embargo line, sir.
God help them if they cross it.
God help us all.
sound general quarters.
general quarters, general quarters.
all hands man battle stations! - Yes, sir.
set condition zero.
general quarters, battle stations.
captain, we already have our orders.
why so eager for new ones?
I've lived through one war, comrade.
I'd prefer not to start another.
battle stations, NOW!
gun boss, target cargo ship, bearing 1-8-0.
fleet reports all weapons ready.
from the Kremlin, sir.
new orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo vessel Aral sea, is hereby ordered to...
...reverse course and return to port in Odessa.
aral Sea, come in.
aral Sea, come in.
they are not responding.
she's not turning around.
aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.
do not cross the line.
target ready to be fired upon, sir.
stand by to fire. - Standing by, sir.
looks pretty messy out there.
aral Sea, you are ordered to turn around.
the crew of the Aral Sea are all dead. Shaw's been there.
he's still here, somewhere.
he's set the ship on course for the embargo line.
that ship crosses the line, our boys are going to blow it up.
and the war begins.
unless they're not on board.
USS Independence, this is, Alexander Nevski.
we have lost control of our cargo ship.
she's been instructed to stop. Do not fire.
repeat, do not fire.
they've signaled their cargo ship to turn around, sir.
it's a ruse, pay no attention. Stand by to fire.
standing by to fire, sir. - On my count.
Five...four...
hold on! Hold on!
No!
what was that? - The Russians, they have fired on their own ship.
a little warning next time, professor.
sorry about that.
you all right? - Yeah.
son of a...
give me Sinclar on the horn, I want a new set of orders.
congratulations, comrade.
you just averted a Nuclear war.
what?
take him to the brig.
what? What just happened?
they say the comrade lost his mind.
the Americans' are plotting.
they're here.
that telepath is powerful.
we're moving to a back-up plan.
that was inspired, Charles. - Thank you very much.
but I still can't locate Shaw.
he's down there, we need to find him now.
Hank?
is there anything unusual on the radar scanners? - No, nothing.
well then he must be under water.
and obviously we don't have Sonar.
yes we do.
yes we do.
they were ready for war.
we just need to strike another match to light the fuse.
and we still have the most powerful weapon of all.
me.
turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output and make sure I'm not disturbed.
Hank, level the bloody plane!
whoa, you back right off.
beast, open the Bombay doors.
remember, this is a muscle. You control it.
you'll be in here the entire time. We'll see you soon.
on my mark. 3, 2, 1 GO!
alert the fleet, they may want to take their cams off.
banshee's got a location on Shaw.
you ready for this?
let's find out.
remember, the point between rage and serenity.
Erik, take my hand!
hold on guys, it's going to get bumpy.
Erik, take my hand!
down.
Moira, Moira, are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay.
I read the teleporter's mind.
Shaw's drawing all of the power out of his sub.
he's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb.
we've got no time, the Geiger counter's going out of control.
all right Moira, this is what we're going to do.
get on the radio and send both fleet's out immediately.
I'm going in.
beast, Havok, back him up.
Erik, I can guide you through once you're in.
but I need you to shut down whatever it is that's blocking me.
then we just hope to god it's not too late for me to stop him.
got it. - Good luck!
raven, stop! - I'm going out there.
we don't have time for this.
anything comes in that entrance, you're taking care of it, ok?
fine.
beast!
if we go, you go
we believe Shaw is trying to detonate some kind of bomb.
Erik, make for the middle of the vessel.
that's the point my mind can't penetrate.
we have to assume that, that's where Shaw is.
gang way, gang way.
that's the nuclear reactor. Disable it.
stop, don't move.
get down!
Erik you're there, you've reached the void.
he's not here Charles, Shaw is not here.
he's left the sub. - What? He's got to be there.
he has to be, there's nowhere else he can be, keep looking.
and I'm telling you he's not, there's no one here, god damn it!
Erik, what a pleasant surprise.
Erik? Erik!
so good to see you again.
may I ask you something?
why are you on their side?
he's gone. - What?
he's gone into the void. I can't communicate with him there.
why fight for a doomed race who will hunt us down, ...as soon as they realize their reign is coming to an end.
I'm sorry for what happened in the camps.
I truly am.
he's back.
Erik, whatever you're doing keep doing it, it's starting to work.
but everything I did, I did for you.
to unlock your power. To make you embrace it.
it's working.
I'm starting to see him, but I can't yet touch his mind.
you've come a long way from bending gates.
I'm so proud of you.
and you're just starting to scratch the surface.
think how much further we could go, together.
stop, Azazel!
I don't want to hurt you, Erik. I never did.
I want to help you.
this is our time. Our age.
we are the future of the human race.
you and me, son. This world could be ours.
everything you did, made me stronger.
made me the weapon I am today.
that's the truth.
I've known it all along.
you are my creator.
now, Charles!
are you okay?
Moira be quiet, I can only control this man for so long.
sorry, Charles.
Erik please, be the better man. You have it in...
but I don't trust you.
Erik, there will be no telling that...
no.
Charles? - Don't do this, Erik!
if you're in there, I'd like you to know that
I agree with every word you've said.
we are the future.
but...
...unfortunately, you killed my mother.
this is what we're going to do.
no, please Erik, no.
I'm going to count to three. And I'm going to move the coin.
one...
please, Erik.
two...
three.
the Russians share our concerns.
and will join a strike on all the mutants.
we can end this threat for good.
we'll never have another opportunity like this.
we have an agent on that beach.
one agent. - She's a good agent.
she's collateral damage.
today our fighting stops.
take off your blinders, brothers and sisters.
the real enemy is out there.
I feel their guns moving in the water.
their metal targeting us.
americans, Soviets, humans.
united in their fear of the unknown.
a Neanderthal is running scared, my fellow mutants.
go ahead, Charles.
tell me I'm wrong.
fleet commander this is X-ray Bravo-70.
respond, over.
the beach is secure, call off the attack.
the beach is targeted and ready to be fired upon, sir.
stand by. - Standing by, sir.
Hello? Hello!
fire. Fire.
Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men.
this is the time to prove it.
there are thousands of men on those ships.
getting orders, innocent men.
they're just following orders.
I've been at the mercy of men just following orders.
never again.
Erik Release them!
Noooooooo
I don't want to hurt you, don't make me.
stay back!
Erik, stop!
gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you.
I'm so sorry.
I said back off!
you, you did this!
please...
she didn't do this, Erik. You did.
us turning on each other, it's what they want.
I tried to warn you, Charles.
I want you by my side. We're brothers, you and I.
all of us, together. Protecting each other.
we want the same thing.
Oh, my friend.
I'm sorry, but we do not.
Charles, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Charles.
it's all right, it's all right.
his society won't accept us.
we form our own.
the humans has played their hand.
now we get ready to play ours.
who's with me?
no more hiding.
you, you should go with him. It's what you want.
you promised me you would never read my mind.
I know.
I promised you a great many things, I'm afraid.
I'm sorry.
take care of him.
and Beast, never forget.
mutant and proud.
help me out, help him.
I'm going to get you to a hospital.
wait, don't, Charles, don't move, okay.
all right, actually I ca...I...I...
I can't feel my legs
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.
in this week of Thanksgiving.
there is much for which we can be grateful.
as you look back to where we stood, only four weeks ago.
the unity of this hemisphere, the support of our allies.
and the calm determination of the American people.
these qualities may be tested many more times in this decade.
so how many students do you think you'll have here? Once you get the academy up and running.
as many as I can manage. Possibly more.
you know, one day the government is going to realize how lucky they were. To have Professor X on their side.
yeah
it has been on the road to a professor now, aren't I.
first thing I'll be going bald.
we're still on the government's side, Moira.
we're still a G-man, just without the G.
no, you're your own team now.
it's better.
you're, "X-Men."
Yes, I like the sound of that.
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.
I know.
they can threaten me all they want, Charles.
I'll never tell them where you are.
ever.
I know you won't.
my love.
I remember the attack on HQ.
leaving to go somewhere else.
and then this morning, I woke up at home.
that's it.
all that time wiped clean from your mind.
just gone.
he can do that. You don't remember anything?
sometimes I get fragments.
like trees, sunlight.
a kiss. - Aw, Jesus.
gentlemen, this is why the CIA is no place for a woman.
what the hell was that?
I know we've had our differences.
Where's your telepath friend? - Gone.
left a bit of a gap in my life. If I'm to be honest.
I was rather hoping you would fill it.
join us.
Erik, I believe.
I prefer...
...Magneto.
five years ago someone blew up the Renelco Corporation plant.
that's what I was sent there to do? What was Renelco?
what does it have to do with the weapon? Renelco created it.
when XIII has the weapon in his hands, he will learn what happened to it.
that's a nice watch, there's a local jeweler who has 3 of those.
all 3 were bought by Maria Cardenes.
you bought this and 2 others just like it?
your face is different, but somewhere inside is my husband.
I gave 2 of the watches to other guys, that's why the file on the chip was incomplete.
you are not my husband.
all you bring is lies.
the letter says you were there, and that you never imagined it would come to the horror that it became.
XIII:"Does it say who hired me"?
a man named Gerhardt, he wanted you to steal a weapon.
what about the other men?
one died, the other 2 were the ones you gave the watches to.
there were 2 men who survived that mission with me.
I find them and what's hidden in the watches I gave them, then maybe I'll have the answers I need.
you talked to Maria Cardenes and the man you know as Seamus O'Neill.
I want to know what you told them.
I told them to place their faith in God.
I know what you did during the revolution
I have confessed it freely and am therefore resolved and forgiven for he sees all, you psycho bitch.
your President's death squads will look like a child's game next to what I'm going to do to you.
why are you wasting your time talking then?
you have work to do.
God can have your soul, Padre.
if you don't tell me what I need to know
he'll have it tonight.
thank you.
they cleared the east gates 7 minutes ago. Should be moments away.
with all due respect to you, Sir,
I am no longer an employee of the US government.
I do not appreciate being kidnapped at the airport by NSA.
kidnapped?
while we're tossing around legal terms,
I've got about a dozen concerning your activities in South America.
we were going to have this conversation eventually.
Yes, Sir.
excuse the rush, but I've the Australian Prime Minister and 200 others waiting for me.
we want to know the results on your trip to Costa Verde.
you went through a lot to evade top level surveillance.
don't flatter yourself, your people aren't that good.
Mr. President, neither of us work for national security, so our personal business is our own.
I heard you were cashiered.
Yes, Sir.
I hope that doesn't affect your loyalty to your country.
not at all, Sir.
so then if I was to ask you, as your President
I trust you'd tell the truth about what you learned?
careful
this is how you end up in a camp in Romania.
we can have a jet fueled in 20-- Shut up, Frank.
Costa Verde was the site of a Black Op.
it was a company called Renelco. Have you heard of it?
no.
I was sent there as part of a team 5 years ago.
we stole designs for some kind of weapon.
and the weapons maker?
dead. Records destroyed.
the data was split into 3 parts and hidden in 3 different watches, useless unless combined.
I have the first part safely hidden and I'm keeping it for insurance.
the other parts of the weapon, where are they?
no idea. No idea?
who hired you?
I'm hoping you can open your files and help me find that out.
is that all?
miss Jones?
we have a lead on the second chip.
Chicago is the location of interest.
there's your next destination.
now you know everything we know.
miss Jones, I'm going to get you better resources.
you're reinstated and I'm upgrading your security clearance.
thank you, Sir.
now because we don't know who or what we're dealing with, we're going to keep this off book.
Mr. President, my people need to stay apprised.
Sheridan's been on my heels since the beginning, knowing him, he has people inside your organization.
that's absurd. I agree with him.
he reports to us.
that's how I'm going to run the play. Clear?
Yes, Mr. President. Certainly, Mr. President.
if you'll excuse me I have some dry shiraz and some ever dryer conversation waiting for me.
by the way
I'm trying to locate a friend of mine.
you wouldn't happen to know where he is, would you?
if he's a friend of yours, who knows where he might have gone.
I guess now would be a bad time to ask about my pension.
I don't care what the President says, you are not going to play by your own rules.
I will watch every move you make.
get them out of here. Thanks for the airport pickup.
they're holding something back.
Oh, Padre, I hear voices and they tell me to do terrible things.
I saw monsters like you working for the government during the revolution;
I killed a lot of them. It was a blessing.
you are definitely a much tougher nut than I imagined.
what a shame.
Costa Verde finally off its knees.
free of the corruption.
Maria's leadership promises a lot.
she's the next person I'm going to visit.
and I will bring her pain that will makes yours seem like nothing.
stop!
plans stolen from Renelco were divided.
in 3 wrist watches.
each has a microchip inside.
the man you call XIII-- He gave them to 2 other men.
names.
robert Simons. He went to Chicago.
another, Max Serle.
I don't know where he went.
thank you, Padre, you are a patriot.
go to hell. See you there.
I was a secret agent, betrayed by my own people.
robbed of my face, my memories, my history
hidden in my past is a secret that threatens all humanity.
I search for answers with nothing to hold onto but the tattoo that has become my name
I am XIII.
how's it going so far? It's thin.
robert Simons was busted a couple years ago under his alias, Connor Wilson.
a DUI?
Yeah, Chicago PD picked him up, Michigan Ave at 2: 18 in the morning.
prints match the NSA file so he's definitely our guy. It's a lucky break.
Yeah, there was a video interrogation but it's not in the system so I'm cross-referencing the Wilson name with all the other government records.
comes up as married, applied for a business license in 2008.
charter boats down by the water, some bar.
but then a year ago, trail just goes cold.
what about the wife?
she's dead, 6 months, breast cancer.
any other family?
he's got a step daughter, struggling with the business.
trying to sell. Well that's our in.
Yeah, look, uh.
before we go to Chicago
there's something we need to get straight between us.
in the President's office you withheld information about the watches and you put me in a compromising position.
I'd either back your story or tell the truth.
you forced me to lie to the President. You could have said something.
yeah I could have, but I had your back.
I'm starting to feel that cuts one way between us.
it doesn't, I had to make the best choice for that moment, okay?
I don't think you understand how hard this is for me.
you and I used to have a level of trust.
and I still feel it. Clearly you don't.
I do know.
and I wish I remembered that part.
so, um...
you still coming to Chicago?
Yeah...yeah, we're going to Chicago.
Hi, you're the one who called?
richard Hadley, My accountant Karen.
she insists on coming along when I go shopping for big toys.
great. Let's go look at the toy.
this is a flagship boat. I've been living on it temporarily.
got two smaller boats but they're docked.
she's beautiful. All 3 are very well maintained.
up to date with service repair, licensing.
the deal comes with a tourist board membership, office, everything except the mini-fridge
I'm keeping that. I'd love to take a look at the records.
if we get that far, sure. Sorry, a lot of window shoppers.
what's she good for, 25 knots?
about that.
powered by?
twin Volvo D12715 engines, two GPS antennas,
vhf radio, LCD TVs and a top of the line stereo system.
she's priced pretty far below market.
boats were my mother and step father's deal.
he left, she died. I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sure revisiting my messed up family lifes isn't how you were hoping to spend the afternoon.
would you like a tour? Yeah, we're here to buy some boats.
right this way.
that'll be all.
I hear you've been to church.
feeling penitent? Washing the blood of the lamb.
and what did he share with you?
there were 3 microchips smuggled out of Costa Verde in the back of watches.
two are still at large.
he went out of his way to make sure no one got the full set of plans.
one of the watches is with a man named Robert Simons and the other, Max Serle.
and he shared this information with XIII and Jones, you're sure?
if you can't trust the dying words of a priest, then it's time to get out of the business.
I want you to run these names through every database. NSA, Pentagon, Interpol.
day light or black query, how should I log it?
log that anywhere I'll have you flying steerage to Syria.
Yes, Sir.
black server, run it through the Balkans.
Mauro, Helsinki Station Chief.
use his clearance, I hate that guy.
give me an hour. We're running those names now.
so...
jones stood there and lied to the President's face.
now, that's going to be useful.
nice trick.
although a waste of a shielded router not to mention expecting me to press my face to a really filthy public phone.
we don't want this call showing up on your log.
you made the acquaintance of Jacinto in Costa Verde.
he's a key figure in the revolution there.
was.
he was murdered yesterday.
it's strange, everyone who comes into contact with XIII seems to meet an demise.
alright, this has been fun.
you had a relationship with XIII when he was preparing for the Roman numeral conspiracy mission and he never told you any of this did he?
about the weapons-- About the people who died?
what else did he do? What else didn't he tell you?
look I've got it under control, I'm doing my job.
really.
why didn't you tell us about the watches?
don't worry, I've already updated Amos and Carrington.
I told them I got the information from you. Why would you do that?
because we're on the same team Jones and I need you in the game.
you have access to XIII that no one else has.
of course that could all change.
so why don't you tell me exactly what you found out.
not much.
we're on a guy named Connor Wilson, a. k.a Robert Simons.
I'm working off an old DUI but apparently Chicago PD erased the arrest footage.
you slide his name through an NSA intercept?
then don't give up so easily.
try out that new NSA security clearance of yours.
and Jones...
yeah?
don't forget who you're working for.
thank you for dinner, but honestly, you'd be better off talking about specs on the boat with my mechanic.
well you look like you need to get away.
truth is, every time I see that boat
I see Connor standing on the back.
Connor was the stepfather.
my mother never gave up hope that he'd come back.
right to the end.
you didn't?
started getting weird the last few months, starting drinking hard.
I wasn't surprised when he left.
why'd you think he took of my dad left when I was a kid, and I never knew why.
I'm not sure.
Connor got busted for a DUI and disappeared.
then some strange looking guy came looking for him.
what was strange about him?
he had these cold eyes. Like he could hurt somebody.
so how long you been on the boat?
awhile.
we used to have a house but living there after my mom was gone.
yeah...
it's the right size to feel comfortable without being claustrophobic.
that's weird. What?
stay on the boat!
is anything missing? I had forty dollars right there and they didn't touch it. Just like the last time.
last time?
my moms place 2 years ago.
somebody came in mess up the place like they were looking for something.
but they didn't take a thing.
mom was sick. Connor had just disappeared.
it was like everything was happening at once.
maybe they were looking for something Connor had?
like what?
everything Connor had was wrapped up in these boats.
I gotta call the police. Insurance company will want a report.
you know, I'd prefer you didn't do that.
I'm going to be entertaining some clients, gonna leave a bit of a bad taste if security gets wind there was a break in.
long as your willing to take it as is, I guess.
not a problem.
think they'll be back?
they didn't find what they were looking for.
my guess is they'll try some place else.
Where's your step father's things? Most of it's still in the bar storage area.
my mom couldn't bear to throw it away.
you should go through it and put any valuables in a safety deposit box.
that's a good idea. What about tomorrow afternoon?
I can meet you at the bar, and come by and help you out.
Why?
that might be the next place these guys come looking.
I'd like that.
tomorrow then.
I need you to dig deeper on Serle.
and I also want 24 hour surveillance on Jones.
and this time don't let her slip away.
power talk 1010 Chicago with your host me Rick 'The Rock' Rescoxski.
coming up on 10 minutes past the hour as promised a very special guest in the studio and you don't get to say this everyday so a welcome, Mr. President.
Hello, Rick, it's great to be here in Chicago. You're engaged in a speaking tour.
Yup.
starting at the Chicago board of trade later today.
just wondering if we can get a sneak preview.
well, I think the first question we need to ask ourselves is, are we safer today than we were yesterday?
now it pains me to say this but President Carringtons's Policy's have left us weaker.
I want the country to know that I think it's time for a change.
where ya been?
I staked out Kelly's barn and boat all day.
no sign of those guys from last night.
getting really tired of people being a half step behind us.
father Jacinto, Costa Verde. What about him?
he was murdered yesterday.
so we have to assume that they know about Simons and Max Serle too.
we got a race on our hands.
did you hear what I just said? They killed him.
we're leaving a body count in our wake now. We can have a minute of silence, but it's not gonna bring him back. It might show a little of humanity.
I'm sorry that he got caught up in this but if we don't find whoever's on our trail there's gonna be a lot more bodies.
I'm trying to reconstruct Simon's last days before he disappeared and it is not going well.
maybe it's Gerhardt's people who are on our trail.
he is the guy who paid for the mission in Costa Verde.
then he should already know what's going on.
and he clearly doesn't.
you and these other guys you take this mission into Renelco right?
you steal the weapons blue prints break them into pieces and you never deliver them to Gerhardt.
so I'm a thief, and a double crosser as well as a mass murderer.
this is the part where you jump in and say 'you don't know that'.
all we know for sure is that you hid the information and if Gerhardt's the one trying to get it then this guy has incredibly deep pockets.
where does Sheridan fit into all of that??
every answer we get just leads to more questions.
can I use your phone?
you got something?
just a Nigerian Prince sends me great blessings and a business proposal.
I'm gonna go meet Kelly ，you find anything out about Simons.
will do.
junk, it's all junk.
is this Connor?
yeah friends of his from his military days.
Max something and...
that's the guy. What guy?
the guy who came looking for Connor after he disappeared. The one with the cold eyes.
tell me again what he wanted?
look, Kelly, I know you think you don't need anyone's help
I don't even know you.
I think you're in trouble.
I just wanna help you know I've been in trouble too before.
he was vague.
looking for Connor said he wanted a contract.
but I got the feeling he was lying.
like I said there was something scary about him.
you don't think he did something to Connor do you?
because if I've been hating him all this time and it turns out
no I'm sure it's nothing like that.
do you remember what contract he was looking for?
one of our boats, the Stingray.
Mr. Gerhardt, I'm calling you to tell you that you were right; he's still the same man even without his memories.
call me back.
I'm not used to people not returning my phone calls.
Gerhardt is a special case there hasn't been a photo or recording of him since 1988.
Giorgino's got his spooks combing the ashes of Renelco in Costa Verde.
it's a waste of time there's nothing to find.
still, it's getting harder and harder to maintain Giordino's distance.
might be time for a change there.
so that's what you wish to discuss?
I'm uncomfortable, Irina.
I'm putting a lot of faith in a weapon I don't know anything about and Gerhardt's cryptic nature is annoying.
when the time comes I will change the world to suit your needs, who talks like that?
very rich men.
Giordino's desperate to get closer to him.
he won't.
he asked me to find financial records linking Gerhardt to the XIII mission of Costa Verde-- Yes but it's a dead end.
I know a thing or two about covering tracks.
but next to Gerhardt, we're all amateurs.
interesting that you tell me this though
makes me wonder why.
my loyalty has a price tag as long as the work keeps coming.
feels like power is shifting.
I'm going to be on the right side.
Oh, of that I have no doubt. So what's next?
make sure XIII doesn't get that watch.
and Irina
a little discretion this time.
no dead clergy.
state your name. Connor Wilson.
I was only over the limit by a tenth of a point.
date of birth.
I can't have this on my record, okay.
you should have thought about that before you got behind the wheel of a car.
Hey, it's Jones, can you talk?
for a minute, no luck with the watch, how's it going on your end? I checked out Simons' bank records.
he cleaned out his account. Took it all in cash.
what about the watch? He's wearing it in the DUI interview.
so it was in his possession. He's disoriented in the video.
paranoid.
well in this, paranoid's a way of life.
he gives his cell phone to a kid, who takes it backpacking around Europe and someone takes a greyhound bus to St. Louis in his name wearing his favorite jacket and a baseball cap.
when NSA pulls the tap on the stations CCTV, it's not him.
what does that say to you? Counter surveillance he was laying a false trail.
this guy was terrified somebody was after him.
I gotta go.
St. Christopher medal, he never traveled anywhere without it.
sorry bar's not open.
I have an emergency.
enough!
you don't look happy to see me.
you know what I'm looking for.
by the time they get here she'll be long dead.
don't throw it.
it's just a watch. We both know that's not true.
whatever story he told you was, it was a lie.
who are you?
so, did Irina get what she came for?
she got a watch, not the one we're looking for.
I don't think she knows that yet.
it won't be long before she figures that out.
Kelly said someone came here looking for a watch two years ago.
I'm thinking it was Gerhardt.
well if they didn't find it then, why did they come back?
maybe they figured we'd have more luck.
which begs the question, where is it?
simons must have it with him. I mean, it's wherever he is.
or someone's caught up with him already.
that's the guy. What guy?
the guy who came looking for Connor after he disappeared.
the one with the cold eyes. Seamus O'Neill.
Yeah.
what you think he made it out?
well he's a highly trained operative, maybe he screws up and gets processed by law enforcement again.
that's a long shot. It is.
I think we have to keep looking here. Sir, we'd like to get a statement from you.
sure.
can I use your phone? Jones: For a secure call?
it's personal. Yeah, go ahead.
stingray Contract.
good morning.
you okay?
who were those guys who jumped you in the bar last night?
the police are looking into it.
did you tell them that the woman who threatened to kill me knew who you were?
pretty big coincidence that people start breaking in here and attacking me right after you two show up.
we work for the government.
great, just great.
what the hell do you want?
we're lookin' for a watch, your stepfather had.
a watch? All of this is over a watch?
it has some very important information stored inside it.
so now the psycho woman who put a gun to my head has it.
that's not the watch we're lookin' for.
so you risked my life to throw her off the trail? I did it to save you.
save me?
I wouldn't even have been there if it wasn't for you.
look, I'm sorry I lied to you, but I did it for you protection.
if you want to protect me, get outta my life. Because I felt a lot safer before you two got here.
that would not have lasted.
the woman who showed up here is a trained assassin.
why don't you just admit you were using me?
okay, the truth
Connor's real name was Robert Simons and he had a piece of an incredibly dangerous weapon.
if this didn't have far reaching consequences we wouldn't be here, and we wouldn't have used you.
I liked Connor when I first met him.
I thought maybe my mom had found a nice guy for once.
what the hell is wrong with me
there's no way that you could have known that, don't blame yourself.
they say attitude makes a big difference with cancer patients.
he was the fourth guy that left her.
she didn't have the will to fight after that.
sometimes Connor talked about being in battle.
and there was this coldness that came over him when he was describing it. It creeped me out.
like the feeling I got from his friend Seamus.
Seamus was here?
I told him.
told him when?
when he saw the picture of Connor with Seamus and Max.
don't you two talk to each other?
apparently not as often as we should.
look, if you could just help us, we'll be out of your life.
I told you, I don't know where the watch is.
do you know where the Stingray contract is?
Yeah, that's what Seamus wanted to see, why?
that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
he killed Connor, didn't he? We don't know that.
I'll get you the contract, then I want you to go.
so I've got some new information.
a phone call that Simon's received right before he disappeared.
from my phone.
when I was prepping you for the XIII mission.
and you think I had something to do with his disappearance.
I dunno, did you?
why didn't you tell me about that photo?
because I don't know what I was capable of.
look, Sam said she knew my nature and that I was a good person.
but I tortured Irina to find out where Sheridan was.
I may have blown up Renalco and killed hundreds of innocent people.
and I may have killed one of my closest friends.
and you couldn't tell me this because you still don't trust me?
don't take it personally, I don't trust anyone.
anyone? I've been laying my ass on the line for you for the last three months. That's your job.
Costa Verde was not my job. Give me some credit.
what do you want from me? I want you to be honest with me.
I want you to trust me.
I'll try, that's all I can promise.
I guess that'll just have to be enough.
wanna look at the contract? Yeah.
there are numbers handwritten on every page.
I dunno, it's some kind of code.
GPS coordinates. Oh yeah.
Plainview airport. It's about thirty-eight miles from here.
it'd be a great place to meet someone, or stash a watch, before you disappear yourself.
intel reports confirm what XIII told us.
Renelco's cover is producing consumer electronics, but the real ambition is weapons manufacturing.
there was a huge fire at the company five years ago.
everyone that worked there was killed.
was this the black ops mission you told me about?
looking at the preliminary profile and comparing it to the intel we already had, it seems like the most likely scenario.
okay, what kinds of weapons could be involved?
well it's hard to say at this point, but I have Giordino digging into it.
I'm sure Sheridan is trying to get his hands on it.
and that being the case, we're probably dealing with more than a couple of crates of AK-47's.
you can see why I'm so concerned about XIII.
Yeah, but I don't think, um
XIII would have debriefed us on Costa Verde if he was on the wrong side now.
if that's all there was to it. What are you saying?
I just wonder how he survived the fire without so much as a singed eyebrow.
it was five years ago.
faces can change, but not the body.
everyone has a breaking point and I saw his during interrogation, there are no burn scars.
do you think he deliberately burned that place down and killed all those people?
there is no evidence to the contrary.
it doesn't make him guilty. It doesn't make him innocent.
you're not gonna be happy until we get him back in rendition camp, are you?
I think XIII is dangerous.
and with all due respect, Sir,
I think your faith in him is misguided.
if XIII will lead us to those watches before some hostile gets their hands on them.
I say he's our best bet.
I hope you're right, Sir.
do you?
I just finished up the security cam footage from the airport and there's no sign of Simons or his car two years ago.
the airport staff didn't have any record of him being there at all.
Yeah, but then here is footage from the marina parking lot security cam showing him pulling out.
at four o'clock on the last day anybody saw him alive.
so...
he could have gone missing between here and the airport.
yeah... Road's pretty populated though.
it would be a magic trick to make him and his car disappear without a trace.
not if he ended up here.
off the road and into the lake. It's worth a shot.
new security clearance has its benefits.
nice benefits.
that's the road he would have had to have taken.
can you view underwater? Sort of...
light deflection will give us a virtual view.
it's just going to be general shapes, but
it's scanning now.
looks like a car to me.
Yeah.
alright, now you're gonna be all right.
it's gonna be at three o'clock.
straight ahead on that line. Ten meters.
it's gonna be three meters ahead on that heading.
I think I see something ahead. Got it.
alright, good work.
Hi, there.
let me ask-- What's in this for you?
the money? And future considerations.
these are powerful men we're playing with.
you think they're gonna share any of that power with you?
my game is my game. What about you?
you think the government will treat you any better?
it's not about that.
let me guess
it's about him. You think the two of you will have some kind of happy ending?
grow old together with lots of grandkids?
you don't even know him.
you're just a means to an end.
he'll let you die just like Sam.
but maybe not quite yet.
you shouldn't leave your things all over the beach.
let her go. She's not part of this.
as long as she's useful to me, she is.
give me the watch. The real one this time.
it's in the bag. No, put it down.
lace your fingers behind your head.
what are you waiting for?
don't. Don't do this.
listen to me.
it doesn't matter who you work for.
if you do this now you become just like her.
someone with no morals and no boundaries.
you have a choice.
why listen to her?
you can't still believe the lies your government tells you.
trust me. You've never heard that before.
trust me.
none of this makes any more sense than it did before.
I cannot believe Connor was one of you.
for what it's worth, I don't think he wanted to be anymore.
I think he just wanted to be with you and your mom.
if it helps any, his death wasn't an accident.
look, we're really sorry we had to drag you into this.
it's okay.
I know you and Connor weren't exactly close, but at least you know what happened to him.
that doesn't make any of this any easier.
we really hope you find a buyer soon.
I'm actually thinking of keeping the boat.
come charter the yacht where a secret agent mission took place.
a little promotion could put me ahead of the competition.
Kelly, you can't tell anyone about this.
or, what? I wind up like Connor?
this is real life, Kelly.
take care of yourself, okay?
you, too.
we heard from Jones. XIII got the second watch.
really.
of course he won't let us anywhere near it.
so why don't we just take it?
cause he's our best bet for getting the third one.
so we can't kill him yet.
there's something else we need to talk to you about, Frank.
there's a leak at your agency. What kind of a leak?
someone in your office has been in regular communication with Sheridan.
I'll take care of it. It better be quick.
Sheridan had Irina Svetlanova convince XIII to get the first watch out of his bank vault.
and then she assaults him in Chicago?
he knows about those watches.
the code from the second watch fits but it's still scrambled.
the final watch must unlock everything.
it's Giordino.
he wants me to get him the watch.
is that what you want to do?
look, Giordino knows we're going to Chicago to get the watch.
and then Irina shows up.
what if the leak is coming from his office?
or from Giordino himself?
I don't know
it just feels like it's you and me alone out here.
looks that way.
well, there is some good news
you definitely did not kill Simons.
the watch stopped when it hit the water.
Four-thirty, June sixth, two years ago.
the call you made from my place-- Four-ten, Chicago time.
you definitely could not have made it to Chicago from DC in twenty minutes.
you're off the hook. On this one.
Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, Sir, he's right here.
Mr. President.
congratulations on finding that second watch.
I had a lot of help.
well, I'm sure glad that Jones is back in the fold.
you two make a good team.
now, I hope you're aware of the potential danger of the information contained in those watches.
I've got a fair idea.
enough people have tried to kill me for them.
well, I hope you'll share whatever information you get with me.
for the good of the country.
I think maybe I hid them for the good of the world.
well, I guess I got my answer. By the way
there is a third watch out there.
somewhere.
I'm sure Sheridan is trying to get it.
we'll be ready for him, Mr. President.
the other parts of the weapon, where are they? No idea.
ms. Jones? Chicago is a location of interest.
you're reinstated and I'm upgrading your security clearance.
thank you, Sir.
one of the watches is with a man named Robert Simons.
another with a Max Serle.
jones stood there and lied to the President's face.
you forced me to lie to the President.
you and I used to have a level of trust.
you had a relationship with XIII when he was preparing for the Roman Numeral Conspiracy mission.
and he never told you any of this did he?
about the weapons?
about the people who died?
president Carrington's policies have left us weaker.
I want the country to know that I think it's time for a change.
if we don't find whoever is on our trail there's gonna be a lot more bodies. There's a leak in your agency.
someone in your office has been in regular communication with Sheridan.
congratulations on finding that second watch.
you'll share whatever information you get, with me for the good of the country?
I think maybe I hid them for the good of the world.
PHILADENPHIA PENNSYLVANMA
you sure this is the right address?
Yeah, it took me about two months of sorting through a maze of blinds and shell companies to get it.
if Max Serle lives here, he's either deep in cover or had a real bad run of luck.
this is it right here.
you looking for a hide-a-key? No there's no keyhole or a doorknob.
there must be an electrical source.
look, you've gotta be careful with that stuff.
I think conventionally red and black are usually hot and green is the ground so.
or, you could do that.
I don't like it.
me neither. It's too easy, right?
welcome to the last moments of your life.
it's an internal deadbolt!
I was a secret agent.
betrayed by my own people.
robbed of my face, my memories, my history.
hidden in my past is a secret that threatens all humanity. I search for answers with nothing to hold onto but the tattoo that has become my name.
Chesapeake BAY MARYLAND
I know you do some work for Frank Giordino, but...
I hope I can trust you to be discreet.
I'm offended you have to ask.
you don't offend that easily.
Giordino is making a power grab.
he's trying to get hold of the second chip and use it as leverage.
he told you his plan?
in my line of work you hear things.
well.
he's become a liability.
can't allow him to gain control of the situation.
are you saying you want the head of the CIA to have an accident?
no...
at least not yet.
let me guess; you want to acquire the chip and at the same time, take Giordino off the board.
exactly.
I could be persuaded to help.
Baltimore MARYLAND EXACT LOCATION UNDISCLOSED
I thought we'd agreed you'd call before you came over.
and I thought we were past all that. Clearly, I was wrong.
so I dug through all the intel on Max Serle and found an additional lead, buried behind a couple of aliases and a defunct holding company in the Caymans.
don't know why someone would go through so much trouble to hide his path and lay booby traps along the way?
he knows whoever's looking for him is dangerous.
What'd you come up with? A storage facility in Washington DC.
another trap? Only one way to find out.
when did you start giving out your number?
I don't. Patch it through here.
yeah? Did you miss me?
I don't think so. Last time I saw you, you were skewered to a lifeguard station.
I thought you might still be hanging around the beach.
too much sun is bad for my complexion.
I have a proposition for you.
who are you working for this time?
I guarantee my clients' confidentiality.
I forgot about your high ethical standards.
I want the information from the chip in Simon's watch.
I'm sure you do. What's in it for me?
the identity of the person who killed Sam Taylor.
Sam was killed in an attempted holdup. That was staged.
it was a hit.
why would I believe you?
because I move in circles where this kind of information is shared.
are you interested or not?
I'll be in touch. Is that a yes or a no?
I take that as a no. Her offer's not going away.
I need time to think about it. Think about what?
that woman is either a sociopath or a psychopath, or both.
either way, she's not to be trusted.
maybe.
but if she's telling the truth, and Sam's death wasn't an accident
I want to know who's responsible.
even if you knew, it wouldn't bring Sam back.
some debts need to be settled.
I would do the same for you.
I don't know how I feel about that. Take it as a compliment.
would you really give Irina that chip?
what do you think? I don't know.
neither does she.
here's the address she called you from.
nice program. NSA. Your tax dollars hard at work.
I suppose your going to do this alone?
not entirely. Don't wait up.
I want a copy of the report outlining Iran's fissionable material program for the President's speech to the U. N. Am I interrupting anything?
no, we're finished.
how did you make out? I managed to turn over a few interesting stones.
and you're certain that your inquiries didn't trigger any alerts at the CIA?
positive. I went strictly old school.
that's the result of 5 days digging through files at the National Archives.
reminded me of all those years cramming for tests in the basement of the Dartmouth Library.
guatemala, Paraguay
sierra Leone.
in each case, operations put in place by Carrington were compromised in favor of policies enacted by the previous administration.
you're suggesting Sheridan had a hand in this.
I'm just stating the facts.
what conclusions would you draw from those facts?
that someone in the CIA has strong allegiances to the former President.
could be anyone.
the Agency is pretty much intact from the previous administration.
maybe it's time to clean house. The wheels are in motion.
anything you want to tell me about?
it is critical that we unearth this mole before they can do any more damage.
is Director Giordino looped into the situation?
Yes.
but I feel it would be best if we conducted an independent investigation from outside the Agency.
I want the circle of communication kept very tight.
am I clear?
crystal, Sir.
enjoy the show?
I've seen better.
did you come to finish me off? I came to talk.
good. You can wait for me downstairs.
CIA HEADQUARTERS LANGLEY VIRGINIA
a Priority One popped up, Sir. Our instructions are to notify.
notify me immediately. Yes, I know.
what do we got?
three minutes ago an aerial drone picked this up in Bethesda.
and what makes this a Priority One?
the building is the current location of Irina Svetlanova.
and the intruder?
exactly. How should we proceed?
per President Carrington, XIII is no longer under surveillance.
sir?
he's a private citizen, and as such, he is guaranteed complete freedom of movement without government oversight or intervention.
listen up!
I want all assets focused on gathering intel for the President's upcoming trip to the Stockholm Summit.
questions?
good. Get on it now.
I need a Special Tactical Group dispatched immediately.
16 Emerson Street in Bethesda.
priority One.
use of force approved.
now you report directly to me, and me alone.
that's a lot of books. This your place?
do you like it? It's kind of manly.
I didn't think that was your style. It's not.
this apartment belonged to a former client.
he didn't honor our deal so I took this in trade.
Where's he living now? I heard he went underground.
did you bring the chip? What do you think?
I think you've stashed it away someplace safe.
tell me about Sam's death.
not until I have the chip in my hands. See, here's the problem.
you don't trust me, I don't trust you.
kind of makes it difficult to conclude a transaction.
how do I know the information you have isn't a lie?
and how do I know the data from the chip hasn't been faked?
coming here was a mistake. Ryan.
we need to set aside our differences for the time being.
I have something you want, you have something I want.
all I want is the truth.
have I ever lied to you?
I don't know. Have you?
hands on your head! Get down on the ground! Now!
seems like you pissed off the wrong people.
what are you talking about? They're after you.
I'm just collateral damage.
I knew this was a bad idea. But you couldn't resist.
come here.
do you really think this is the time and place?
definitely.
how did these stones get there?
I grabbed what I could when I hit the desk.
slipped them into your belt on the way out.
why my belt? Because if they found 'em on me, they would have resorted to violence.
and if they found them on me?
I suppose I deserved that. Finally we agree on something.
are you crazy? I'm not gonna jump.
I still have very close ties with the National Society of Mining,
petroleum and Energy in Peru.
I can get all the copper we want at a very favorable price.
I'll call you back. Glad you could make it.
I'm on a tight schedule. I won't keep you long.
things are heating up and I need to know, definitively, where your allegiances lie.
well, at this point, the only person I have complete trust in is me.
after all we've been through I'm hurt you'd question my intentions.
when all of the pieces are finally in play, you're going to be in a very powerful position.
I'm in a powerful position already.
true. But, uh...
head of the CIA is an appointed position.
I put you in that job.
and I still have enough pull in Washington to keep you out.
you see, Wally, that's the problem.
you want my cooperation, but you treat me like a hired hand.
those days are over.
if you want continued access to my resources, then we need to redefine this relationship.
what did you have in mind?
I want to be an equal partner and I want a face to face meeting with Gerhardt.
an equal partner?
I'm gathering intel on Max Serle.
but I'm not going to share the wealth for some vague promises.
when all this goes down and I step in for Carrington, you step into Amos' shoes.
that's hardly enticing. Okay, how about this?
combine Director of National Intelligence with Secretary of State.
see now you're wetting my appetite, but I want to hear it directly from Gerhardt.
that's not going to happen.
then let me make this as simple as possible.
without the Agency, you will never get that third watch.
that sounds like an ultimatum, Frank.
you've always been extremely perceptive, Mr. President.
are you really willing to walk away from this?
walking away is just the beginning.
alright there's a river four clicks to the west and the mountains to the north, so they're gonna be headed east.
we need to get out ahead of them and box them in.
go.
give me a status update.
they escaped, Sir. Escaped?
I'm gonna be sending in some reinforcements.
we don't need additional men, Sir. The targets are shackled together.
we won't have a problem reacquiring them.
maybe, maybe not.
but either way, I'll be sending in another team to assist you.
copy.
and if you do encounter any further problems capturing the targets.
you have the green light to terminate.
we've got to keep moving.
we're running blind. We need a plan.
the plan is to keep moving.
are you sure this'll work?
Yes.
how do you know they'll come this way? They can read our tracks, and they're highly motivated.
what now?
we need an anchor pin and a trip wire.
where did you learn this?
Bitterroot? Boy Scouts.
I found those at the apartment. There was clearly a struggle.
what exactly was XIII doing there?
I believe he went there to meet with Irina Svetlanova.
you "believe"; meaning you're guessing that to be the case or you know it to be the case?
the latter, Sir.
when were you planning on telling me?
at the appropriate time.
the appropriate time is now, Agent Jones. Yes, Sir.
XIII was contacted by Svetlanova.
she said she had information pertaining to who killed Samantha Taylor.
I thought Sam Taylor was killed during a holdup.
Yeah, I thought that as well.
what was Irina hoping for in exchange for this information?
the chip from the second watch.
the same chip XIII refuses to give to his own government?
he was never going to give her that chip.
he just wanted to ascertain what she knew. Do you know where they are?
no, Sir. I have no idea.
maybe this will lend some insight into their whereabouts.
Mr. Haynes. My office.
do you think that's for us?
if so, these people are well connected, and determined.
which means we should be putting distance between us and them. We're wasting valuable time.
we're not wasting time. We're waiting. There's a difference.
how long do we wait?
as long as it takes.
have you done this before?
no idea.
what's it like having no memory of your past?
frustrating.
there are some things in my life, I'd like to forget.
Yeah, I'm sure. Are you always so chatty?
not a chance.
you wanted to see me, Sir?
my Haynes, do you know agent Jones? Only by reputation.
in some circles, you're a legend, Agent Jones. A legend.
well I don't really know what to say to that.
Mr. Haynes, we have a situation here. Of course, Sir, sorry.
what can I do for you? Take a look at that.
what've we got here? We're hoping you can tell us that.
this came from a handheld transceiver.
ANPRC 148. Miltary issue. Interesting.
this is a TYPE III DES encryptor.
it puts the walkie on a protected frequency.
anything else?
this kind of encryption is used almost exclusively by your boys at the CIA.
latest status?
the reinforcements arrived. The targets are flanked.
we're moving in. Do not underestimate them again.
copy.
let's check it out.
don't I get a vote here?
not much in here to work with.
your problem is you don't have enough imagination.
there's gotta be something we can use.
maybe half full. What are you gonna do with that?
use my imagination.
perfect. You take that, and I'll take the rifle.
we use the rifle and we give away our position.
it's cracked.
you were right. Not much to work with. Let's get moving.
are you hurt? It's nothing.
let me see. I told you, I'm fine.
you'll have to be better than fine to outrun these guys. Now, let me see.
ironic, isn't it.
we might end up getting killed out here because you put a spear through my shoulder.
sit down.
this is the second scar you've given me. I haven't forgotten.
trust me - neither have I.
this will hurt. I don't mind a little pain.
hold this.
I bet you liked playing doctor as a child.
keep still.
alright that should do for now.
like I said, I'll be fine.
let's go.
we're blocked. River to one side, mountains in front.
they're probably moving in an extended line, closing in.
which means need to outrun them.
we need to outsmart them.
any word from Brock, over?
negative. He may be engaging the targets, over.
or he may be down. Find him, over.
copy.
have you ever used a bow and arrow before?
I don't know. Have you?
I favor guns or knives. The closer the better.
I like to see their eyes when they die.
how about you?
I don't take pleasure in killing.
but you do it so well, and without remorse.
I don't have remorse if the target is someone who needs to be killed.
and how to you decide if they "need killing?
because usually they're trying to kill me.
it's too bad you've lost your memory.
you don't have a clue of how many people you've killed.
you keep count? Want to guess how many?
you're sick.
you call it sick, I call it professional pride.
we are not that different, you know.
I'm nothing like you. You're a hired assassin.
and how do you know you're not?
now.
we make a good team.
does anyone have a 10 on Greene or Brock? Over.
this is Hoult, no eyes on Greene or Brock. Over.
I want them found. Report back when they are. Over.
they'll be closing in on us soon.
you ready? Why do you get the hammer?
because I'm stronger. Hold steady.
if you miss, you'll break my hand. I'll try not to then.
do you really know who killed Sam? Yes.
why do you want the chip? It's extremely valuable.
valuable to who? The highest bidder.
it's no use. Let's go.
you're in no condition to outrun them.
who do you think they are?
my guess is an off-the-books hit squad for the FBI or CIA.
agent Jones? What about her?
could she be the one behind this?
no.
was she with you when I called? Do the math.
she works for the head of National Intelligence.
how can you be sure she didn't sell you out?
what's it like living your whole life without trusting anyone?
safe.
answer me, do you trust Jones with your life? I've had enough of these games.
because you're uncomfortable. Because you know I'm right.
because you're a psychopath.
I'm not going to sit around and wait for them to surround us.
like you said, we need a plan. I have one.
and I'm going to need a Boy Scout.
I got this from a friend of mine over at the Agency.
interesting.
how does this whole thing add up for you?
Giordino saw the surveillance footage and told his agents that XIII was no longer on a watch list.
when their efforts were directed elsewhere, he sent out a covert team to pick up XIII and Irina.
that Frank didn't immediately report Priority One surveillance goes against protocol.
with all due respect, following Agency protocol doesn't seem to be Director Giordino's strong suit.
I've had my suspicions about Frank, and this goes a long way towards confirming them.
do you realize the ramifications of the Director of The CIA being a mole?
this will send ripples throughout the entire intelligence community.
get me Director Giordino on the line.
I see...
if he calls in, have him contact me immediately.
he's not there and he's not picking up his cell.
nobody seems to know where he is.
so...
how do you want to play this? I want to shut down his access codes.
freeze him out.
I'm guessing he's going after the second chip.
it cannot fall into his hands.
closer.
have you got them yet? We're closing in.
give me your coordinates?
39 degrees 8 minutes north, 76 degrees 29 minutes west.
okay, I got it.
I'm going to call you back.
damn it.
sir, Sir!
the beacon's coming from one click to the east.
you think it's Brock or the targets?
either way, we're going in heavy.
radio the position to Hawk One.
copy.
go.
go.
sounds like your plan worked.
I think it's time the three of us came to some kind of understanding.
you killed two of our men and injured five others.
I could have you both locked away forever. Be like old times.
this would make your rendition camp look like Club Med.
but you won't because it's not part of the plan.
for now.
so how's this little arrangement working out?
not so well for your men.
that's no way to treat a lady.
how's this?
how about we get to the point of this exercise?
agreed. I want the chip from Simons' watch.
it's not for sale.
even in exchange for your life?
that's a weak bluff. You shoot me, you don't get the chip.
maybe I get the chip, maybe I don't.
if you leave me no other option,
I am prepared to kill you and take my chances.
you see, the Ex-President thinks the key to everything is up here...
I don't happen to share that sentiment. I figure once I get the chip,
I can work out the rest of the details.
now you're going freelance. The game's changed.
it's every man for himself. So...
...do you want to live another day?
here's another deposit for $50, 000. Looks like Frank has been planning for this day. Can we freeze his accounts?
only the ones we know about in the US, no telling what he has under false names or stashed in overseas accounts.
come in.
I inserted that SIM card into a transceiver.
I was able to run a GPS triangulation and pinpoint the location of the other walkies.
may I?
may I...?
be my guest. Thank you.
here's the thing... I'm getting two signals, which means that whoever is using those walkies must have split up.
location one is Rock Creek Park off of Ridge Road.
and where's the other one?
looks like a public storage facility in DC.
public storage-- That's where our assets will be.
you're certain of that? Trust me.
the woman's a legend. I'll scramble a team.
I'll take my car and meet you there.
I'm getting impatient. You've got one more try.
you. Open it.
another dead end. What the hell is this?
no more killing!
Freeze!
Jones! Any sign of Giordino?!
No!
XIII and Irina went that way out of the yard!
Jenkins, get your team on the move!
did you set up that trap for me?
don't flatter yourself.
this storage unit belonged to an associate of mine.
Max Serle? Where did you hear that name?
I get around.
and seven, nineteen, zero six.
the date of the Costa Verde job.
that's impressive.
what now? Now...
you tell me what really happened to Sam.
and in return? In return, I let you walk out of here alive.
you sound like Giordino. The difference is, I mean it.
after everything we've been through, this is how you treat me?
you got me into this.
wrong! Your government got you into this.
where did you get that? Took it off one of the agents.
get out of here.
what about our deal? We never had a deal.
it was all a lie. I told you I've never lied to you.
the hit on Sam was ordered by Giordino.
Why? Because he's afraid of you.
he knew he couldn't break you one-on-one, so he decided to isolate you and take away your support system.
anyone you were getting close to had to be removed.
no...
Sam was first. Jones was going to be next.
Giordino's planning on killing Jones?
as soon as she's outlived her usefulness to him.
you say Giordino ordered the hit.
but who pulled the trigger?
it was a pro from Venezuela.
where do I find him? What do you plan to do to him?
make him suffer.
where do I find him!? You don't.
he was killed.
his body cut up, fed to the sharks.
and how do you know this?
because I was the one who killed him.
so, what about the chip?
I don't have it.
I cut it up, and fed it to the sharks.
you wouldn't lie to me, would you, Ryan?
you practicing for Giordino?
he's not gonna get off that easy.
how's that agent you shot?
broken ribs and he's going to need a new vest.
thanks again. My pleasure.
any news on Giordino?
he's in the wind.
carrington wants his head on a platter. Tell him to get in line.
Amos has taken over day-to-day at the Agency and he's got all of his resources on it.
word is Giordino's got Max Serle's name and is going after the third watch personally.
any new leads on Max Serle? He pulled a complete disappearing act.
no hits from contacts, foreign or domestic.
look, we've got to get to the location of that watch before Giordino does.
I'm widening the net. If Max Serle's alive, we'll find him.
so, what was it like being chained to Irina for 12 hours?
only reason I didn't kill her was because.
I didn't want to carry around a dead corpse. I would've cut off her hand.
thought about it. Think she was telling the truth about Giordino?
it makes sense, but with people like her, you never get the whole truth.
makes me sick the whole time when we were in Venezuela,
Giordino was plotting to kill Sam.
well, he's shown he'll do anything for power.
now he's desperate, which makes him even more dangerous.
and more likely to make a mistake.
and when he does.
I'll be waiting.
there's a battle on the boards with both teams really digging for the puck.
now it squirts loose, and the Ice Wolves have it.
and the puck is cleared out of their zone.
and here they come!
what a hit!
come on, boys, use the body!
take him wide, take him wide! - Rapton's flying up the ice.
take him to the outside! Here we go.
he shoots! Nice save by Drah.
what a hit!
what action, eh, Hank?
the Ice Wolves are just getting hammered. - Oh, no.
tooth, Tooth, Tooth!
there's a familiar chant, Jim. - Thompson.
and the coach is calling for the big defenseman, Derek Thompson.
and here comes the Tooth Fairy.
find a dark jersey and hit it!
tooth, Tooth, Tooth!
that is an incisor!
I got the tooth. I got the tooth, baby! Yeah!
and the Tooth Fairy, Derek Thompson, has struck again.
you can't handle the tooth. And that's the tooth...
...the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth.
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.
open the door for the Tooth Fairy.
penalty on number 14, Derek Thompson.
five-minute major for boarding. - Yeah!
who's the Tooth Fairy? Am I the Tooth...? I'm the Tooth Fairy!
stop it. Stop it.
Yeah, no, I'm not scared, you know. I play hockey.
we'll go out, have a good time, see what we make of it.
what's going on out here? - Come here.
I want you to meet the future of our franchise.
new kid. - Yeah.
he's not gonna be here long till he gets snapped up by the Kings.
but listen, while he is here, your job on the ice is to take care of him.
okay. All right. - Nothing else matters, right?
Mick? - Yeah.
Derek, Mick Donnelly, our first-line center. Mick, Derek. He's your bodyguard.
what's up? - Welcome to pro hockey.
Yeah, is there an old-timers' game today?
I didn't realize you were even still playing, man. I used to be a big fan.
all right. See you later, man.
so I guess that's my bodyguard.
crazy. - He's a big one.
Yeah, he's a big guy.
Hello, Mr. Thompson! - Mr. Thompson.
tooth Fairy!
can I have your autograph?
Yeah, sure. Absolutely. What's your name, buddy?
Gabe. I'm the third-leading scorer in my hockey league.
our team won the Mighty Mite's Championship.
wow, that's fantastic. Good for you, Gabe.
one day, I'm gonna play hockey in the big leagues just like you used to.
you work pretty hard at hockey, do you? - I play almost every day.
and I drive him almost every day.
how old are you? - I'm 8.
you're 8. You're 8. Okay, well, here's the deal, Gabe.
you're 8 and you're the third-leading scorer in your league behind two other 8-year-olds.
well, one's 9.
okay. Well, see, Gabe, somewhere in this country, there's a 7-year-old...
...playing against 12-year-olds, and he's outscoring them.
he's killing them, making them wanna get run over by a Zamboni and die.
there are a bunch like that kid in every rink. When the time's right...
...those kids will battle it out and only a handful of them will get signed.
now let's say you do make the NHL.
you won't...
...but let's say you do. You hit the show right out of college.
the show hits you right back. Before you say "slap shot..."
...you're down to the minors with a blown-out shoulder and nowhere to go.
listen, lower your expectations.
that's how you're gonna be happy.
there you go, Gabe.
I want to suck your blood.
what? What are you looking at?
and laughing at? Why aren't you afraid?
because those are French Fries. - No.
I can't eat French Fries.
french Fries are fatal to vampires.
Hey, I have an idea. - Can't talk. Still dead.
mommy, my tooth came out. - Hey. Yay!
Oh, congrats.
the tooth fairy's gonna visit me tonight. - You bet. Let's see.
you are such a big girl.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm the Tooth Fairy.
I thought you said you were a vampire.
you got some inconsistent mythology.
I have a lot of homework. Can I be excused?
Yeah.
mommy, it's time for you to go now so Derek can start babysitting.
not just yet. Wanna go put your jammies on?
I wonder if it would help if Randy and you had some one-on-one time.
sure, I could do that. So long as I don't have to be alone with him.
well, Rene's here. Oh, a little ketchup.
Oh, tooth fairy. - You know what? I got it.
look, I put on my pajamas.
Dracula's back from the dead.
and your French Fries are not powerful enough.
what do you guys think of Donnelly? - Man, that kid is fast.
you mean the next Gretzky. - I love him already, like a long-lost brother.
can we just play? - It's to you.
I'm a little short. - He's a little short.
but this autograph that says "The Tooth Fairy..."
...is worth 10 bucks on eBay. Ten of these is 100 bucks, so I'm in.
no, you gotta pay. - It's not a socialist game, Castro.
Hey, it's me. I'm good for it.
I'll be right back.
he took his cards. - Is this guy serious?
just fold so we can play. - Who takes the cards?
don't the kids have, like, a piggy bank or something?
I'm home! - Hello, gorgeous.
Hey. - Hi, guys.
Hey, Vinnie's? Some brews? - Let's do it, boys. Come on.
all we have is juice box here.
know what, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna hang out, but I'll walk you guys out.
mommy! Mommy!
mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
what happened, honey? - My tooth is gone.
well, that's because the tooth fairy took it.
but there's no money. I looked.
let's look together. I'm sure it's here somewhere.
the vampire has returned. - Not a vampire moment.
it's not anywhere. - Well...
I bet they took it to weigh it...
...on the toothometer to see what it's worth...
...before they bring the money. Right?
sure. That's how the whole tooth thing works.
no. That's not how it works.
you put the tooth under your pillow, the tooth fairy flies into your room...
...when you're sleeping, takes the tooth...
...and leaves a dollar. Where is it?
okay. You tell me when to stop when the tooth fairy has been here.
because I have 5, 10. I even got a 20. - Derek.
stop.
okay, Tess, you're a big girl now.
you're 6. Let's get this out of the way.
there's no such thing as a too...
here it is. - How did it get down there?
Oh, you must have rolled over in your sleep and it fell on the floor.
I forgot. People forget.
so your big idea to handle it was to tell Tess there is no tooth fairy?
come on. The reason why there are so many unhappy people in the world:
they're clinging to some version of what if.
okay, so dreams are bad?
if they lead to unrealistic expectations, then yes.
this is ridiculous. - I know.
I'm going to bed. - No. Carly.
and you...
...are leaving.
don't get all dramatic. - I'm her mother.
I get to say when her childhood fantasies end, not you.
what?
disbelief in fairy. Summons.
what? What?
Yes.
Thompson? Derek Thompson?
Yes. Yes, God. It's me. Is that you, God?
you're Thompson?
you're God?
no, I'm Tracy. I'm your caseworker. What is this?
how disappointing.
come with me, please.
no, thank you. Thank you. Fairy Krishnas.
what are you wearing?
I don't know what I'm wearing. What are you wearing?
who is this guy? - Dream killer. I don't like your sort.
What'd I do? Why am I here?
where am I? - No one likes your kind here.
no one likes your attitude. The way you show up acting strange. "Why am I here?"
what are these giant wings? - Hey, hey! Do we have a problem?
Yeah, we have a problem. You just said, "Do we have a problem..."
...which has given us a problem. - Right.
Tracy, right? - Yeah.
what a pretty girl's name you have. - Don't laugh at that.
that's strike two. You don't wanna get to strike three.
Oh, yeah? What happens after strike three? - Strike four.
Yeah.
we'll get your uniform sorted out and then we can get you registered...
...and begin your training. - Training for what?
training for what? You, Mr. Thompson, are gonna spend some time...
...as a tooth fairy.
Yeah.
as a tooth fairy.
someone get him, please. Calm down, everyone.
he's relatively harmless.
everyone all right? - Really? What are you, fairy patrol?
I'm 230 pounds of man. It's gonna take more than eight fairies to get me.
get your fairy hands off me. Is this fairy etiquette?
all right. Okay.
where were we? - Help! Wake me up!
I'm in a nightmare! Please! Please, help me!
the nightmare's just beginning, buddy.
you want a shot at the title?
is that it? You feeling lucky punk? - Hey.
maybe I am. Hold these, baby.
I can't see anything, give them back. That... It was a stupid idea.
Oh, yeah. You want a piece of this, huh? I'm ready to go.
Hey.
you just made a big mistake.
no.
please. You got a magic wand.
you gonna pull a rabbit out of the hat?
fairy fight!
let's not get carried away. - Now I got one too.
I'm gonna introduce you to the Hammer brothers, Sledge and Jack.
who do you want? Who do you wanna meet?
I can't see. Can't see. - Oh, dear.
it looks like you picked on the wrong fairy.
I can see. Oh, magic wand.
Oh, my gosh, the magic wand go bang-bang.
what is going on here?
I'll tell you what's going on. - The sugar-dumb fairy showed up.
he was gonna introduce me...
...to the Hammer brothers. - They're still in town.
stop it! You're behaving like leprechauns.
he has got such a major attitude problem.
Oh, I'm well aware of his attitude, believe me.
Hello, Mr. Thompson. - Hi.
sorry about the foul-up with your outfit.
budget problems. Tracy will take care of it.
who, him? Yeah, sure. Great.
you, sir, are guilty of disseminating disbelief.
killing dreams.
committing first-degree murder of fantasy...
...which by fairy law... - Wait, is this because...
...of what happened with Tess? Listen... - Excuse me.
I hadn't finished speaking. Did I look as though I had finished speaking?
don't know. Everybody's got British accents.
you just interrupted me again while I was admonishing you for interrupting me.
do I not look official enough?
I don't understand...
...why policemen or firemen don't get interrupted...
...but you add a pair of wings and suddenly all manners go out the window.
shouldn't you be more in awe of somebody with wings than without?
you have no idea what I'm capable of.
I could just fly up into the air and do something crazy.
maybe I breathe fire.
you don't know.
I'm sorry for interrupting you. I didn't mean it.
that is better.
in order to pay your debt to humanity...
...you are hereby ordered to serve time as a tooth fairy.
the normal sentence is one week...
...but because you have the nerve, the unmitigated gall...
...to actually call yourself a tooth fairy...
...thus make a mockery of everything we stand for...
...l'm sentencing you to two weeks' tooth-fairy duty.
no, no, no. It's unfair. No.
interrupting. - Interrupting again. Unbelievable.
take him away. See that he's properly outfitted and get him into flying school.
I'm sorry, what?
Oh, but first, you get to meet Jerry.
excuse me, Fairy Godmother? I have one last question.
does this tutu make my butt look big?
Yes.
huge.
egg on the face.
no, don't. No. - Come on.
all right. - Good. You got the male version.
give us a spin so I can see. - How about I give you a spin with my fist?
what does that mean? - It's a threat.
it sounds like you're gonna... - I'll punch you in the nose.
you should have said that. Clearer. - What's that?
that is just pathetic. Just like a child.
chicken is fine.
I don't hate your chicken.
I like your chicken. I hate your brisket.
Yeah, I'm coming. Goodbye.
never marry a leprechaun. Oh, the dream-popper.
Hey. Did it make you feel good to lie to that kid?
I didn't lie. - You told the kid there was no tooth fairy.
right. - Liar.
look, I'm sorry l... - "Sorry" is a beginning.
now, if you're gonna be a fairy, you gotta be ready.
although...
Yeah.
dude, there is a pill.
I mean, an amazing pill.
you take this pill, you don't have to do any of this.
Really? - No, I was just kidding.
you're mad. You believed, then I took it away.
be mad at me, I don't care. I have tenure. Come on, walk with Jerry.
okay, here's your tool pouch. Waterproof. A lot of compartments.
you can get a lot of stuff in there. You dig?
Yeah. - Okay. This...
this is your wand. Tooth detector, radar jammer. Keeps picking up Radio Caliente.
I don't know what that's about. - What's that?
magic generator button.
does whatever you want it to do. But you have to believe or it won't work.
so it's pretty much useless to humans. And this.
you don't ever wanna lose this.
what is it? - Well, it looks like an iPod adapter.
right, so, what is it? - It's an iPod adapter.
what's it for?
listening to your iPod.
you get a free iPod. Did you not ask for your free iPod?
no. Really? - I'm just kidding.
Yeah, why do you keep doing that?
I'm not well. I actually just have a few months to live.
Oh, you're kidding. - Of course. Would I share that with you?
I just met you. Plus, you lie to kids. Come on, we got business to do.
invisibility spray.
use it, nobody can see you except other fairies.
and this, dude, trust me.
shrinking paste. You put a little on your tongue...
...you shrink down to about 6 inches tall.
you wanna do it? Come on, let's do it together.
come on, we'll jump into each other's hands.
I don't wanna jump into your hands. - Really? Come on. Let's get small.
sometimes when I'm home with the wife, right...
...l'll take a double hit.
I get down to that big. My feet dangle in the inkwell.
then when she's out, I walk all over her body.
when she wakes up, there's footprints all over. She goes, "What is this?"
I go, "Hey, I don't know." See, when you're married a long time...
...you do stuff like this.
all right, let's see. What else?
would you like a mint? I made them myself. Here.
taste them. Come on. Really good.
go ahead. Taste it.
Yeah, sure. Great. - Help yourself.
these are good.
Yeah, these are good.
Dog-bark mints. Comes in very handy. - For what?
cats, mailmen, dogs that come up behind you.
or if a kid you lied to comes after you. - How many times I gotta say I'm sorry about that? - Six times.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sorry, I was just kidding. I can't believe you did this.
did you play without a helmet or something? What is with you?
it's like your brain is in a penalty box, I'm telling you. And you got...
...the eyes of a shark, but, like...
...deader. All right, listen.
cat Away. Important. If you're not a cat person...
...this thing will come in very handy. Yeah.
I almost had a senior fairy moment. Don't you move.
this is my greatest invention ever.
amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid forgets everything for the last few seconds.
Yeah, right. Come on.
that's how it works. - How what works?
amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid forgets everything for the last few seconds.
that's how it works. - How what works?
amnesia dust. Throw a pinch, the kid forgets everything for the last few seconds.
that's how it works. - How what works?
never gets old.
you wanna fly, you gotta believe. But you gotta learn to use your wings.
"use my wings." You know how ridiculous you sound right now?
who's your hobbit friend over here?
wait. You stay here, okay? You have to learn from the best.
and some dang fool accused this guy of being the best.
me and flying is just not gonna happen. I've got an old hockey injury...
...so I probably got a bad wing.
that's one I never heard before. - How's it going?
what's up, man? Want me to turn He-Man into Peter Pan?
don't get me started, homey. - What is that? Your secret fairy jiving?
maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got a bad wing. I can't fly.
put me down! - D. O. D?
Yeah. - I'm cranking this baby up.
put me down.
I think you're ready to practice the F. O. A!
F. O. A?
what's F. O. A?
flying object avoidance.
I throw something at you, you get out of the way, okay?
you better not throw anything at...
you wanna get in on this, Tracy? - Put me down!
imagine these are your responsibilities and you're avoiding them.
bring it on! - Wimbledon!
it's Hammer brother......
raise your right hand, repeat after me. I, fill in your name.
I, Derek Thompson. - Swear to uphold and perform.
swear to uphold and perform.
the duties, responsibilities and obligations.
the duties, responsibilities and obligations.
of a tooth fairy.
of a tooth fairy.
of a tooth fairy. - And that I will not drink and fly.
drink and fly?
okay, no, that's serious. That's serious.
that I will not drink and fly.
welcome aboard. These coupons are redeemable at the gift shop.
maybe I could have a fairy bumper sticker.
all right, I concede. It's real.
fairies do exist. - It's too late.
your sentence begins tomorrow. - No, no, no.
no. There's gotta be a way to postpone this, like jury duty.
I'm sure up here you have fairy duty or whatever it is you have.
I've got a coach breathing down my neck. I gotta patch things up with my girlfriend.
the interrupting thing. I'm sorry.
any assignment you miss, you get another week.
and if you fail your terms of service...
...or tell anyone you're a tooth fairy, your time will be extended indefinitely.
Oh, really? I'm not leaving. - Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.
no.
I'm sorry.
for what?
what I said last night.
which part?
all the parts that deeply offended you.
okay? Everything I've ever said or thought. Even before I met you.
wanna come in? - Oh, yeah.
you can spend that one-on-one time with Randy.
Yeah.
let me go to my car and get something, and I'll be right back.
me and Randy.
all right. Yeah.
I didn't know you could shred. - What do you want?
I brought you a present. Guess what it is.
is it a puppy?
no, wise guy, it's not a puppy. It's one of my hockey sticks.
and now, after signed, "Your pal...
...the Tooth Fairy..."
...now it's worth a lot of money. There you go.
okay. I'm just gonna leave it right here.
I bet you get a lot of chicks with that guitar.
can we stop this now? - Stop what?
you're just like my mom's past boyfriends.
pretending to be nice to me to impress her. - No, you're wrong.
I'm much better-looking than your mom's past boyfriends.
big-boy pound for trying to break the ice.
no? It's going away. - I have to get back to practice.
how about you come over to my place, I could break out my old drum kit...
...you could bring your guitar, and we could have a jam session.
how about I just go tell my mom you're actually pretty cool...
...and you stop trying to bond with me? - I'll take that deal.
so you'll never believe what Randy said about you after you left.
he said that you were actually pretty cool.
well, I am pretty cool.
I'll say.
well, whatever you're doing is working. So why don't you keep it up?
who's "T"? - I have no idea. I don't know.
what I do know is I would love for you to close your eyes...
...because I have an amazing surprise.
Really? Okay. - Oh, yeah.
close your eyes. - Okay.
all right. Be right back.
is my surprise 6-foot-3 with dark-brown eyes?
Oh, you'll find out shortly. - I love surprises.
get ready.
Oh, I know you're right in front of me.
keep your eyes closed. - Okay.
don't look. Everything's okay.
don't peek. - Okay.
I need some air. - What?
I'm not feeling well. - Should I come...?
No! No.
can you give me some Pepto? - Of course, where is it?
it's upstairs in the bathroom. It's way...
...upstairs. - Oh, my gosh.
Hello? - Hello.
who is this? - It's me. It's Tracy.
Tracy who? - Tracy, your caseworker.
your first assignment has just fallen asleep...
...so get yourself over quick to 663 Shelter Cove.
I thought that was a dream. - Think again.
Derek? - Oh, no! No.
where are you? - Bushes. Don't come any closer.
you can't see me like this. It'll ruin your romantic image of me.
Oh, honey. You are so sick.
Yeah. - I checked the entire bathroom.
I couldn't find anything.
look underneath the sink. Underneath the sink.
way back deep underneath the sink.
okay. - Hello?
you heard the rules. You can't miss an assignment.
plus those wings will stay until you get that tooth.
Oh, man.
you could clean up a little.
my wing.
delicate. Well done. - I can't believe this is happening.
it is happening, so get in the house and fetch the tooth.
no, no. I'm not going anywhere.
why don't you go in? - It's not my job.
that doesn't make sense. You're a fairy. You go in and get the tooth.
I'm not a winged fairy. I'm a caseworker fairy...
...which involves more responsibility.
there's a lot of filing and putting stuff in envelopes. It's tricky.
so you're saying you're not good enough.
I'm not. - And they stuck you behind a desk.
no, I'll tell you what they did.
there's a lot of wing discrimination in the workplace. Very funny.
how you gonna get the tooth? - Maybe I'll wing it.
brilliant. How are you gonna get in? - On a wing and a prayer.
this is very funny stuff. - Which wing of the house...
...should I start with? - Want another week?
no. No, no. I don't want another minute of this.
so, what do you suggest, Einstein? I can't fly, so do what?
how about you shrink yourself down and slide under the door?
just shrink and slide in. Yeah, that's what anybody would do.
it is, actually, okay?
is this gonna hurt? - Let's hope so.
come on. - And how do I get big again?
it's automatic. From the moment you shrink, you start to regrow.
it normally takes about an hour. Come on.
I can't believe this.
eat it. - Shut up.
down the hatch.
yum, yum, in Derek's tum.
nice?
Oh, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
not so brave now, little wee man.
no, no, no!
wing jokes aren't so funny now. The shoe's on the other foot.
okay. Okay. - You should shoe me some respect.
I'll shoe you some respect.
when I get bigger, I'm gonna slap the glasses off your face!
you "shoe-dn't" upset me. - Is that the best you got?
just take the money.
Hey, watch it! Don't throw money!
my wing. My wing.
money's heavy. Money's heavy.
I hate this. I can't believe... Oh, my wing. My wing.
okay.
no, no.
I'm the tooth fairy.
the tooth fairy. No, no, no.
it's okay, buddy, we're coming. Don't worry, sweetheart.
what's going on? What is it? Darling, we're coming.
what's going on? Are you okay?
honey, what's the matter? - I saw something.
what did you see? - It was a little tiny man.
hope you're not hungry.
nice kitty. Don't hurt me, kitty.
I'm the tooth fairy!
disappear! Kitty, be gone!
Derek?
Carly? - Come cuddle with me.
no. - What?
going to bed. Still not well. - Hey.
I'll call you when I'm bigger. I mean better.
Hello, fans. I'm Steve Levy coming to you from the wolf den...
...Here in Lansing, Michigan, home of the Lansing Ice Wolves.
we are about to see the potentially historic debut of an 18-year-old phenom.
Mick Donnelly is just about set to take the ice for the first time.
you pumped up for your first game?
Yeah, pops, I'm super pumped.
it means one less game until I'm out and into the bigs.
I'm done being generous.
this is my kingdom. You're in my kingdom.
I'm the king. You know what you are?
you're like one of those little guys in tights who run around the court in a poofy wig.
Mick the Stick! Mick the Stick! Mick the Stick!
looks like you've been dethroned.
this is it. Final minute regulation time.
the Ice Wolves lead the Roughnecks two to one...
...and the kid Donnelly has lived up to the hype.
he's still working on that hat trick.
the puck comes back to the Roughnecks.
there's a quick shot. Nice save.
the puck goes into the corner, and Donnelly's picked it up.
now he puts on the brakes and spins out of trouble.
look at him fly, Jim.
he fakes another defender, and here he comes.
Donnelly's rushing up the ice. Look at those moves.
he's going through the Roughnecks like they're a bunch of rented mules.
Donnelly circles around the Roughneck goal.
he looks out front to pass. Now he kicks it off the board.
now Donnelly clears himself off the boards and takes a pass in the slot.
he looks to shoot!
what a bone-crushing open-ice hit to Donnelly. And he's down.
thompson was gonna clear Lembeck out...
...and suddenly instead, he just dropped to the ice. No one even touched him.
Hey, Thompson. You cost me a hat trick and an interview on ESPN.
Hey! Get over here. I wanna talk to you.
Hey! What are you doing? Get out here.
no, no, I'm very busy right now. No autographs. I'm busy.
fine. I'll wait.
what are you guys talking about?
what the heck?
what's he wearing? - Check out Thompson's feet, boys.
Derek.
he looks like a little girl hockey player. - Disappear.
no, no, no. Either you come out or we're coming in.
Yeah.
one. - This is not good.
two.
three!
what happened? Why are you late? Where have you been?
don't talk to me. Shut up. - Why are you wet?
and I hate this job. - What's that smell? That's intense.
I can't breathe. That's too much.
it's making my eyes hurt.
hello. - Hi.
what the...? - Mom, I'm home.
Where's the kid?
be nice. Be respectful. - I just came out of a toilet.
do you think I care? Mama fairy. There is your tooth.
you do whatever it is you do here in fairy world with your teeth.
Mr. Thompson, according to your caseworker...
...you're not exactly embracing the tooth-fairy spirit.
Really? Is that what my caseworker said? - No.
you called her. Let me tell you something. My caseworker here has wing envy.
not true. - It is true.
I am a giant fan of all the administrating.
you hate this job. - I live for it.
no, you don't. You hate this. - Will you two stop it?
just look at what you have done to this family.
who are you? - Who are you?
I don't know. - Am I home yet?
it's not funny. - See the dog? His eyes were like that:
you overdid it. - Fairy Godmother, who is your supervisor?
who's above you? Gandhi? Who do I talk to?
I wanna file a complaint now. - You have another assignment.
are you kidding me? - Sometimes there's a double-header.
tell me where the tooth is so I can get it and go home.
Oh, no, not until the child falls asleep. Till then, I'm afraid you have to wait.
come on. I saved you a seat. - Okay.
one kid falls asleep in the afternoon. Another kid's up all night.
Oh, I love a cup of tea.
good tea? - Refreshing.
Hi. You feeling any better?
Yeah, a little bit. How about you guys come on up?
Hi, Derek. - Hi, gorgeous.
actually, I have a really big favor to ask.
Tess and I just got a last-minute invitation...
to a beauty makeover party! - Nice.
a beauty makeover party.
I was wondering, because you're getting along so well now...
...if Randy can hang out with you for a little while.
please?
Yeah. Yes. Of course.
super, thank you. I'll make it up to you.
be good. Have fun. - Bye.
that's awesome.
I can see hockey's been really good to you.
do you wanna hang with me or do you wanna go get a beauty makeover?
pretty cool stuff in here, huh? - Yeah. Whatever.
why don't you take one down, see how it sounds?
I don't want to.
no, here. Give it a shot.
please. Don't. - Give it a shot.
let's see how it sounds. Go ahead.
that sounds great. I'm gonna go check out the drums and the sticks.
in the meantime, you just keep practicing because all that is just awesome.
Hi, Randy. - Hey, what's up?
you sound pretty good. - Thanks.
you gonna play in the talent show? - Kelly!
there you are.
why you talking to emo boy?
don't be a jerk, Ben. - Your dad's waiting. We have to go.
Bye, Randy. - Bye.
don't think about talking to her. You got it, loser?
okay. - You should put this away...
...because you stink.
what are you doing with Randy's guitar? - I don't know.
so you should give it back to him. - Okay.
now you can get out of here. Beat it.
you are in trouble now. - We'll see.
Oh, I know we'll see. Can you beat two pair?
call me and find out.
big boy puts in all his big-boy Doodles.
look at that. Me too. I'm not scared because it's aces over kings.
flush. - No.
Yes. Look at all these Doodles, and they're all mine.
nice. - Yeah.
I'm gonna enjoy these. - Don't rub it in.
can I ask you something?
it's about your body and how it's changing, isn't it?
what? - Everything that's happening to you and your body now is natural.
are you growing...? - No. No.
do you have a funny feeling...? - Stop.
you'll start to grow... - No. Stop talking.
okay, okay. Well, you... - That wasn't what I was gonna ask at all.
okay. - It wasn't even close.
okay. All right. Big-boy pound for not wanting to talk about puberty.
right? Yes, thank goodness. Believe me, I don't wanna talk about it either.
all right. What's up, seriously?
all right. Well...
...there's this talent show coming up at my school and...
okay.
my mom thinks I should play in it, and I'm kind of...
I don't know.
well, maybe you should play in it.
yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah, you will be great. I heard you play. You're really good, man.
and the chicks, they love guitar players.
we're back! - Hey, baby. We're up here.
don't tell your mom I said that about girls.
Hi, boys. How'd it go? - Hi.
well, your son cheats. - Does not.
he absolutely does, and you look... - Gorgeous!
you took the words right out of my mouth.
you guys hungry? How about we get supper?
love to.
Where's your coat, hon?
Oh, no.
you guys gotta go. - Is someone hurt?
no, not hurt in a way that you have to be worried.
both of you look beautiful. I'll call later. I'm sorry.
okay... - Bye.
shrinking paste? Nope, not that again. Amnesia dust? No.
flying? Bad wing, forget it.
Oh, hey, and by the way, your all-purpose magic generator button.
it doesn't work. It's broken.
here's an idea, brain-box. Why don't you...?
don't touch my pouch. - All right. That was too much.
what do you want? - Get out the magical invisibility spray.
okay? That's relatively idiot-proof.
Yeah, I know that.
ignore my last comment.
Hey, what a surprise. It doesn't work. Your stuff stinks.
nice.
shame it wears off.
earthquake.
did you hear that? - Yes!
ghosts!
are you lost? Can we help you?
how would you like a little amnesia dust?
where am I? - Just go to the white light, my friend.
just go to the white light.
nice doggy.
don't hurt me, doggy.
what is this?
it's a long and delightful story. - Where's the tooth?
can I get a little help here?
that'll be all.
you might just be the worst tooth fairy ever.
by the way, I need some more stuff. - Stuff?
stuff. The magic powder, the gunk. I need some. Notify Q.
no. No more stuff. - Well, that's brilliant.
I have a week and a half left. How am I supposed to do that?
sorry, we're running very low on funding. And would you like to know why?
no, not really.
because children aren't believing as they used to.
Oh, it's not just us.
it's unicorns, leprechauns, dragons, all those departments. Completely gone.
if this trend continues...
...Tooth Fairyland will cease to exist.
no child will ever again receive a visit from a tooth fairy.
ever. - No more visit from the tooth fairy.
so what?
you really don't get it, do you?
you don't see that children's fantasies...
...their abilities to imagine, are important?
why, it nourishes their very souls.
it's the foundation that allows them to dream.
dreams are bad. They're bad.
they're useless.
you're done. - For the week.
no, for the night.
unless you wish to stay for fairyoke.
Oh, my. No.
fairyoke. Like karaoke isn't bad enough.
me?
I got what you need.
what's that? - The goods...
...the stuff, package...
...the bag, the bomb...
...the juice, the bing, the bang, the Frisco special...
...Pink lady, little drummer boy...
who are you? - Ziggy.
you can call me whatever you want. Zigman, Zigmeister...
please stop talking. - You know, they want you to fail.
what? - Think about it.
you fail, they tack on more time.
it's like credit-card debt, man. They just wanna keep you paying forever.
yeah? - You really wanna play that game?
so? - A thousand bucks.
thousand bucks? You're killing me, Ziggy. - How bad do you want this to end?
can I write you a check?
Oh, my goodness.
you can see me?
Oh, man. This better work.
Oh, no. What is that?
what are you doing?
what did Ziggy give me?
big head! Really big head!
just stay calm. - 911? 911?
I just need the tooth. - There's an alien on my porch.
you are amazing.
Lily is ticked off because she had to send another fairy to clean up your mess.
I learned my lesson. Never buy black-market stuff.
I can't go another two weeks without it. - Yes, you can, friend.
you just have to surrender to a higher power...
...and take it one day at a time. - Hello?
caseworkers decide who can see us and who can't.
which you'd know, if you ever paid any attention...
...ever listened to anything I say, but no. You're always:
shut up. - Hey. My friend.
you really need to get yourself cleaned up.
if you want, I can give you a pamphlet.
and FYI, your sentence has been extended.
Lily tacked on another week, so well done.
great. Just what I need. - I think it is what you need, friend.
listen, I can give you fresh supplies right now.
on one condition: From now on, you follow the rules.
you embrace the fairy spirit. And you start listening to old muggins here.
fine. I'll be the best tooth fairy ever.
you keep running out on me to see l-don't-even-know-who.
and then you never call, and when I do finally hear from you...
...It's to bail you out of jail. What's going on with you?
I wanna tell you, but I can't.
why not? - I...
I just can't.
I know what this is.
this is you acting out. You're afraid of commitment.
you're nervous about us getting serious.
Yes. That's it.
you know me so well. I'm nervous about how serious we're getting.
what?
you're a woman. And frankly, you wouldn't understand.
what?
no.
no, I'm not nervous about us getting serious.
I wouldn't even think about getting serious with you.
what?
I freaked. And, Carly, I love you so much.
I'm scared of messing up and I'm scared of losing you.
I understand.
I'm so glad you could share that with me.
where can I get some of that?
what are you doing? Are you oiling up your abs again?
I'm coming! - Hurry up.
Hey, I've been stepped on...
...flushed, bitten and arrested.
will you stop complaining? You promised to embrace the fairy spirit.
Oh, I'm embracing the fairy spirit, all right.
but I'm doing it my way.
I'm not sure that's in the rules.
Oh, yeah.
I'm just here for the tooth, sir.
just the tooth.
I'll take my glove away.
that's it.
now, just hand over the tooth.
nice and easy.
let it go.
let it go.
I said, let it go.
very good. You have a good night, sir.
Hey.
who are you?
I'm the tooth fairy.
Oh, yeah.
you got it? Let's go. All right, Mick, how's life in Lansing so far for you?
it's been good. I'm the new blood of the team.
some of these Wolves are getting long in the tooth, if you know what I mean.
when you say "long in the tooth," that would be a reference...
...to Derek Thompson, the Tooth Fairy.
it's not a rivalry, you know. I respect my elders.
has Thompson taken you under his wing? - No, his wings are tattered.
my wings are new and ready to fly, and I like to do my own thing.
a confident, young hockey player.
good luck this afternoon. - Thank you.
the Ice Wolves dump the puck and look to make a line change.
Mick, get ready! - Finally.
Hey, good luck out there, buddy. - Okay.
no, I mean it. I think you're gonna do great.
you're the bestest hockey player ever. - Whatever.
Mick, change, change! - Hit him, hit him!
Yeah. - Come on, Floyd.
Donnelly jumps into the play...
...and takes a cross-ice pass. The Ice Wolves...
...Charge across the blue line. Big scrum in front of the net as these two rivals start to get a little feisty with each other.
Oh, yeah.
all right. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
the puck goes into the corner, where Nubin chases it down.
what's the matter with him? - What's up with Donnelly?
get in there, Donnelly! Get in there!
the puck squirts loose. Now Donnelly picks it up...
...skates to the point, looking to set up a play.
bring it up. Bring it up. - Hi.
Donnelly takes a terrible fall.
what happened there, Jim? - Who hit him?
someone hit him? - Anyone know who hit him?
what is going on?
what is he doing? - Stop it.
is he laughing?
Donnelly, you okay, kid?
what?
are you trying to test me, kid? - Get off the ice!
listen, you wanna play games? You can head over to the daycare center.
get out of here. Right now. Move it.
so, what'd I miss?
why you bark?
I'm not gonna be ready. I'll get up there and blow it.
you'll be fine. We just gotta keep practicing.
everyone's gonna laugh at me. Maybe I shouldn't do this.
well, maybe they will...
...or maybe you'll blow the roof off the place, huh?
man, you're good. But you're not gonna find out if you quit.
you can't score if you don't take the shot.
yeah? When was the last time you took a shot?
listen, when I first started, I was a scorer.
first-round draft pick of the Devils, playing in the bigs.
so, what happened? - I busted my shoulder one night in Chicago.
they sent me down to the minors to recover, and it took forever.
I got so angry and frustrated.
one night, I got into it with some meathead from New Haven.
knocked out a couple of his teeth, crowd went crazy...
...and they started calling me the Tooth Fairy, and it stuck.
and I haven't scored in years.
but I've got more penalty minutes than anyone else in the league. Yeah.
but, like, isn't your shoulder all healed now?
it's just not the same.
but how do you know? You don't even try.
you can't score if you don't take the shot.
I'll tell you what. I will if you will.
okay. I'll take that deal.
Hey.
all right. Thank you.
and another tooth.
Hey. That must be good.
that moment when you hand over the tooth.
not that I'm interested. Just wondering, you know, how it felt.
why don't you find out? - We've been through this. I'm not winged.
okay. Explain to me one more time. Why can't you have wings?
do you know nothing about fairy evolution? - Fairy evolution. Who wrote that...
...Charles Darwing?
inspired. Brilliant.
according to fairy evolution, some fairies can grow wings and some can't.
and I'm one of the unlucky ones.
Tracy, you don't have to have wings to be a tooth fairy.
Hey, remember, you've got all of this. - That is true.
somewhere in there, you gotta show them your strengths. Speed, agility, flexibility.
right. And how am I gonna do that?
around the cones, around the cones. Quick feet, quick feet.
no. Come back. Come back.
where are you going?
look at the size. - Get over the fence.
it's 3 feet high. You're 8 feet tall. Go back.
a dinosaur! - No, it's not.
what the heck?
come on. Over the fence.
I'm all right. I'm okay. I'm okay.
you okay? - No. Good night.
it's a child! - Why'd you hit the kid?
they've got matching robes. It's my worst nightmare.
don't drop me. - Yeah.
I got it. I got it.
I'm there. I'm not there.
you look like a beautiful reindeer with your legs. You're prancing, you're prancing.
not on the kid, on yourself.
amnesia dust. Amnesia dust.
Yeah!
dust, dust, dust. Up.
you sound great. You're gonna kill them tomorrow night.
so, what do you think?
nice. That is big time. Randy Harris. Talent show.
I like that slot too. - You think I could be a famous rock star?
like Clapton or Hendrix or Stevie Ray Vaughan?
you want it straight? - Yeah.
okay.
you're getting pretty good, right? So let's say you keep working at it really hard.
then let's say you become the best 13-year-old guitarist in your neighborhood. Here's the deal.
remember there are a lot of neighborhoods...
...with a lot of 13-year-old guitarists.
but somewhere, there's a 12-year-old who's shredding it.
I mean, he is killing that guitar.
yeah?
you know what? Yeah. It's possible.
cool.
go get them.
late in the third period, Ice Wolves down four to three to the Arrows. Donnelly is getting a breather, but having another great game.
the Arrows leading scorer, Crosley, takes the pass, and he is on the move.
Mickey, your line's up.
all right, old man. Got a fresh pair of Depends on?
you never know, kid. I just might surprise you.
ice Wolves dump the puck into the Arrows' zone, change lines on the fly...
...as the coach throws Donnelly back in the game.
Allegheny's got the puck in their own zone. They're crossing the blue line.
change! Change!
and here comes Thompson off the bench, replacing Goff.
thompson knocks Crosley flat on his back...
...and kicks the puck in the neutral zone, where Browley picks it up.
thompson jumps back into the play as Donnelly weaves around Crosley.
now Thompson takes a pass right on his stick as Donnelly flashes into the play.
it's a two-on-one with Thompson of all people leading the rush.
pass it!
Donnelly's screaming for the puck, but Thompson won't give it up.
pass. - Pass it! Pass it!
pass!
thompson looks to pass.
no, he fakes the pass.
he's got the top shelf wide open.
Mickey's open! Pass it! - Pass.
No!
what a hit on Thompson. - What is he thinking?
the Arrows have numbers, coming up the ice.
they shoot, they score! - Damn it.
Jim, it looked like Thompson was actually gonna shoot, and he just choked.
you're not a hockey player. You're a sideshow attraction!
you know what? Why don't you watch tomorrow's game from the bench?
you bum.
come on, boys. Come on now. Here we go. Here we go. Come on, let's start up.
Oh, great.
Hey, honey. How was your game?
not good. - Derek, guess what.
I have another loose tooth. - Good for you, honey.
what's the matter, hon? - Everything.
nothing. You know, forget it. - Can we go practice now?
can we skip today's session? I just don't have it in me.
the talent show is tomorrow. - You'll be fine.
I need one more run through... - No, you don't.
no, I do need it. I just need a little more practice. Just so I can get it down.
it doesn't matter what you do in the show. You'll never be a famous rock star.
you'll just be another kid with a guitar. Do yourself a favor and give it up.
Derek. - Look, I'm sorry...
...but it's for his own good. Trust me.
No!
come on, Tess. Tess, let's go.
what is wrong with you? - Look, I had a bad day.
had a bad day? - I had a bad day, okay?
no. No, that is not okay.
you are never gonna speak to my children again.
we are done.
Carly.
you know what your problem is, Derek? You can't say "what if.
and you never will.
okay. Okay.
okay, okay, okay. All right.
who wants to hear some good news?
I do. Come on.
why are you here? - Lily gave me this.
only a permit, but I'm on the way. - You should be on your way out.
I'm going to bed. - It's thanks to you.
we've gotta celebrate. I know a place where the hot fairy godmothers hang.
are you out of your mind? I just lost everything that's important to me.
my girlfriend, those kids, and I probably hung up my skates for good.
all because, like an idiot, I bought into your tooth-fairy garbage.
look where it's gotten me.
you make one effort and it doesn't work out...
...and suddenly you're just gonna give up?
it's not supposed to be that easy, and you know it.
I'll tell you what I do know. I know that you don't have wings.
so that means you can't fly.
that also means that you can never, ever, ever be a tooth fairy.
what happens if you try to escape out a 10-story building? I'll tell you what.
splat, just like that.
you know what's really sad?
the person you hurt the most with all your dream-killing...
...is not Randy or Carly or even me.
it's you.
get out. - Fine.
good.
fine.
I'm going to bed.
one twenty-four left in the third period...
...with the Ice Wolves still trailing one to nothing.
and Derek Thompson is still completely in the coach's doghouse.
I don't think he's seen a second of ice time. - Here we go, here we go.
as he has all game, Andreas Petrenko, the Mute Brute continues to replace Thompson on the first line.
face-off won by the Lumbermen.
what a hit!
Donnelly steals the puck, and now he's rushing up the ice short-handed.
only Coletta can get back. - Let's go, Mick. Let's go, Mick.
this is classic. Every move Donnelly makes...
...Coletta's got an answer.
Donnelly shoots to his left.
he's got Coletta out of position and Donnelly moves around him.
he's got the defenseman beat. He shoots!
hits the crossbar.
what happened? They blew the whistle.
back behind the play, Jim, Petrenko got sucker-punched...
...and I don't think he's getting up.
Thompson.
go.
go.
all right, here we go.
the Ice Wolves have less than a minute to score...
...and send this game into overtime.
off the face-off, it's Plattsburgh with the puck.
and they start their drive as the clock winds down.
I don't know. It looks to me like Thompson is just going through the motions out there.
Oh, my! Thompson just got leveled.
how could that not be a penalty? He just got crushed.
I think the Tooth Fairy just got a taste of his own medicine.
look at Thompson, Jim.
he looks like he's got some jump back in those legs.
Thompson's rushing across the ice, and I don't think it's to make friends.
well, this is gonna hurt.
No! He pulled up, Jim. He didn't throw a check.
incredible!
he steals the puck and now is barreling down the ice.
look at him go. - Ellis can't keep up with Thompson.
he's making moves we haven't seen in a long time.
who is that guy?
thompson only has one defender to beat.
he takes the stick to the face.
I think he's going down. - No, he stays on his feet.
he's gonna shoot!
he shoots!
he scores!
Yeah!
Yeah. All right, nice shot.
Derek Thompson has not taken a shot in nine years.
in one of the most amazing shots I've ever seen, it ties it up at one all.
call me the Mayor of Shockville. Let's do it again.
Hey, old man.
not bad.
Yeah, Derek. - Nice shot, dude.
way to go.
and here we go.
we're under 20 seconds as both teams head to the center line for a face-off.
Oh, no.
the Ice Wolves win the drop.
there's a cross-ice pass to Thompson, who ices it.
why would he do that? - I have no idea, Jim.
no, I can't leave now. This is my last chance to actually play the game...
...to go out the way I came in.
I could cover for you. After what I've seen, you deserve it.
thompson, what are you doing? Who's he talking to?
aren't you a trainee? Isn't that breaking the rules?
please, I've learned from the best.
but I do think you should look at the address before you decide.
it's Carly's house.
Hey, 14. Come on. Let's go.
thompson, get back in the game.
I can go. Lily does not have to know. - But I'll know.
this is my house to take care of.
let's do this. - How? You can't fly.
good time to learn.
I knew you had it in you.
go get them.
you wanna fly, you gotta believe.
no need to panic. It's just a giant amnesia gun.
it's painless. You won't remember a thing.
don't you forget about me
you will.
good luck finding your cars.
Tess?
Derek.
Hi, honey. - Hi, Derek.
I like your costume.
I have to tell you something.
I was wrong.
the tooth fairy is real...
...and it's me.
I know.
no, honey, I'm not talking about the hockey Tooth Fairy.
I'm the real tooth fairy.
no, you're not.
you are the real tooth fairy.
it'll just be our secret, okay? - Okay.
Randy?
what are you doing here?
I have to talk to you.
go away.
listen, those things I said yesterday?
I was wrong.
I don't care.
you gotta keep playing guitar.
you're really good.
and nothing you love doing that much could ever be a waste of time.
I'm so sorry.
even if I wanted to, I can't.
I smashed my guitar, remember?
tonight is the talent show.
hold on one second.
maybe this'll help.
it's awesome.
How...? How did you do that?
all-purpose magic generator.
what are you wearing? - You'll find out.
in the meantime, put some clothes on. We can still make the talent show, okay?
come on.
Derek?
mommy, Derek is the tooth fairy.
you rented a fairy costume to make it up to Tess.
Yes. That's what I did.
Hey, Mom. Derek got me a new guitar, and he's taking me to the talent show.
what time is it? You'll never make it.
it's gotta... - Don't worry about that. We can make it.
you, that way. You guys, go up and get dressed, and we'll see you over there.
Oh, yeah.
Where's your car? - No car. Let's go.
hang on!
how is this happening? - It's okay. It's okay.
Yeah, but like how is it possible?
it all started one night. I got a summons underneath my pillow.
what is a summons? - A summons is like an invitation.
I got an invitation to Fairyland. - Fairyland?
it's where I got these wings. I met this guy up there named Tracy.
he looks like a walking toothpick with the eyes of a big tuna.
by the way, I can shrink myself down to 6 inches.
pretty good.
what?
I'm sorry, buddy, but I've already broken enough rules.
Randy, there you are. We've been looking all over for you.
get in there and tune up. Come on.
another tooth. - Thank you.
you're welcome. I've got a concert to get to.
no, you skirted quite a few rules tonight, Mr. Thompson.
but I took care of Carly, I dusted Randy...
...and Tess, she's only 6, so pretty soon she'll forget.
and even if she doesn't, at least now she'll...
she'll always...
always what?
she will always believe...
...like I will.
I get it. Dreams are good. For everyone.
Mr. Thompson...
...I hereby relieve you of tooth-fairy duty.
you're good. - She's a pro.
Congratulations.
put that away.
l... I tend not to do the whole physical contact thing.
Oh, you like me. I know you like me.
you do the whole distant administrator demeanor thing which I understand, but somewhere in there, you like me.
well...
...let's not get frisky.
I really gotta go. - Yeah. Could you wait just one second?
Tracy, I need another word with you.
what's this about?
anybody that can rehabilitate Mr. Thompson...
...more than deserves...
...these.
are these?
it's your wings, Tracy.
wear them with pride...
...every time you collect a new tooth.
you're a tooth fairy, buddy. - I got my wings.
you got your wings.
here. You need this.
little bag. I don't know why I'm speaking like this.
no?
thank you, milady.
this is great and I'm proud of you. You're the tallest tooth fairy in the world.
but I gotta go. Somebody's gotta poof me down.
Tracy, would you like to do the honors or shall I?
Oh, so honors? Oh, a gift. Yeah. - I'm afraid not.
you're not gonna remember anything that happened in Fairyland.
Why? - Because that's just the way we do it.
I'll never forget you.
I can't believe you showed up at the rink.
it's just the way we do things.
thank you, Tracy, for everything.
you big four-eyed giraffe.
go back to the zoo.
and you get that head back to Easter Island.
hammer brothers are still in town.
let me meet those guys.
you're my man. - And you are my fairy.
could we e-mail or something? - We should be able to e-mail each other.
do you blog? I'd love to read your blog. - I do blog. Wanna read my blog?
do you Facebook? I could poke you. - I'd love to be poked!
Yes.
Oh, there you are. I couldn't find you. - Hi.
Yeah, I was just at... I was...
I am so excited. - Me too.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Hi, honey. - Hi, Derek.
good job, Timmy!
keep it going for our last performer of the night...
...Randy Harris!
Randy!
go, Randy! - Yeah!
way to go, Randy! - Great job!
Randy! That's my kid!
Hey, I was just wondering. What if we got married?
what if we got married?
did you hear what I said?
I said "what if."
Yes. - Yeah?
we're getting married.
Yeah!
we're getting married.
good evening, everybody.
welcome to Staples Center, the home of your Los Angeles Kings.
now let's introduce tonight's starting lineup for the Kings.
at right wing, number 13, John Zeiler. - Hey, excuse me. Hey, dude! Dude!
Hey, big daddy. Just wanna shake your hand. I don't want anything.
excited to see you back in the NHL right where you belong.
look at you now, huh? - Do I know you?
no, I'm just excited to see you because I believe in you, man.
I believe in you, big daddy. I believe in you, Derek Thompson.
in goal, number 32, Jonathan Quick.
and starting at left wing...
...number 40, Derek Thompson.
Yes! - I got you a few of your favorite things.
Oh, thank you, Jerry.
it's not every day the boss asks me to go off-campus.
it's about time I got you out of that basement.
that's cool. - Did you see him?
Yeah, we're fine. - Oh, I miss him.
Yes! Knock him on his bum.
it's like a whole new you.
I don't know why you like this. You can't even see the ball.
it's called a puck. - Yeah, but you can't even see it.
I mean, something that small moving that fast...
...It'd be so much better to get closer to it.
you know what I mean?
Jerry. - I'm gonna do it.
you're not. - I'm gonna do it.
no. No, Jerry. - I gotta do it.
I gotta do this. Okay, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm just kidding, I gotta do it.
this is gonna be cool.
I love my job!
that was a rush.
thank you.
I don't know why I'm speaking like this.
Kitty, be gone!
all units, all units. Code 3 pursuit of 2- 11.
white SUV heading east on Alameda service road.
suspects: Three Asian males.
be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.
Cheryl, can you see how many suspects are in this car?
Oh, this is just coming in.
Hancock!
what, boy?
bad guys.
trying to cut them off. You can see them there.
...shooting randomly on the freeway.
what, you want a cookie? Get out of my face.
asshole.
what? - You heard me.
please, stay off the freeway.
asshole.
watch out!
Damn!
damn it!
Hancock!?!
beat it, 'Soulja Boy! '
...and he appears to be negotiating with the gunmen.
he smells like a bar!
you pay for new roof!
fellas, hey. I don't give a shit what you did. I don't care.
three guys in the car, no girls, rave music.
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.
but if you don't pull over and give yourselves up quietly...
...I swear to Christ, your head is going up the driver's ass.
his head is going up your ass. And you drew the short stick...
...because your head is going up my ass.
shoot this asshole!
stop!
what the fuck?
the department is on their way. There's just chaos here on the 105.
こんにちは
what? I'm not Japanese, man!
put us down!
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh? "Speaky Engly" now?
you broke my glasses.
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!
put us down! - You want down?
Yes, please! Please! - Help me!
I'm real good at down.
all right? All right.
this, Hancock's latest act of so-called heroics...
...took a hefty financial toll.
initial damage estimates are said to top $9 million...
...which, if accurate, represents a personal record for the notoriously publicity-shy Hancock who, as usual, can't be reached for comment.
with all the cracks to the concrete, all the bullets, water damage, fires...
...L. A. Would be better off if this guy would leave and let us get on with our jobs.
Hi.
don't think I'm crazy, okay? We've looked everywhere for you.
going to the Roxy and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...
...anywhere we thought you would be at. I found you.
I got you.
so, what's it like when you fly?
no, what? - I ain't gonna fly you.
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my best friend in the entire world...
...and I swear to God she would not be here today if it wasn't for you.
she crashed her car up in Malibu and you flew her to the hospital.
remember?
I will break my foot off in your ass, woman.
you got a car?
Hey, want a drink?
so this is where you live. This is your hideout.
your Batcave.
your Fortress of Solitude.
it's a couple trailers I stuck together. - What's all this?
jiffy Pop. - Jiffy Pop.
what do you do with it? - Pop it.
jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.
hold on.
want me to give you something else to pop?
I didn't catch your name. - Pop this, Superman.
not much for the chitchat, huh? Let me set this over here.
all right. Now, there are some rules. - Hello?
no, I know, I haven't seen it yet. - Excuse me.
I know, probably. All right, all right.
let me call you back. - Listen.
you're gonna need to focus. All right, I need you...
Hey, that's... That's not focusing. - What's in there?
okay, all right, hold on. Stop. Stop it. All right, now...
...when I get to the moment... - The moment?
you know, the... Start climbing the mountaintop, you know?
you know... All right? Yes. - Yeah.
you're gonna need to be as far away from that as possible.
far. That's hot. - No, that's not hot. It's not hot.
Oh, yeah. - Okay.
Hancock. Oh, yeah.
now you're doing too much. - Hancock.
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!
mountaintop! Watch out!
sorry.
that's not fair to anybody.
thank you for being okay with that.
I know it's... - Can I use the bathroom, please?
Yeah. Hey, you...? You want some Jiffy Pop?
no, thanks. - It's straight back.
you all right? - Yeah.
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.
hey...
listen... You know, if you want I could fly you.
it's really beautiful, you know? Earth.
you could see the...
might have to get you a helmet, so your face doesn't tear off.
what do you think?
sir? Ray Embrey.
ray. - Pleasure.
ray's like the Bono of P. R.
well, actually, I think Bono is the Bono of P. R. but I do try.
well, let's see it.
okay. I'll get right into it. Good morning, everyone.
I'm here to talk to you about charitable giving.
okay? And we all know the way that works.
you give one, maybe two percent of your net cash...
and you get an armband or a ribbon or whatever. It's nowhere near enough.
and that's why we at Embrey Publicity would like to offer you the AllHeart symbol.
now, you would be among a very select group of corporate giants to bear this logo on your product.
and what this would say to the public is that your company, Pharmatopsis has made a radical contribution to helping our world.
here's all you need to do to qualify.
your new TB drug, Mycodin?
we would like for you to give that product away for free.
did you say "free"? - I did.
only to those who need it.
only to those who without it would otherwise die.
as a concept, free is kind of up there with, you know, lethal side effects.
mandatory product recall. - Get indicted, go to jail.
get out, work at IHOP for the rest of your career.
understandable reaction. It's a radical concept.
but it is the brand that represents a fairer and better world.
the brand...
...that everyone is talking about.
who is "everyone"?
we do already have a sports franchise.
NFL? NBA? MLB? - Soccer.
MLS? Which team?
well, it's a local team. Encino Hurricanes.
it's my son's team.
anyway, we can save the world.
all right? Someone's just gotta go first.
what do you say?
are you a crackpot?
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store. I am on my way.
I think I made a connection.
not really.
listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming and l... Damn it.
and I want some meatballs, okay?
I need some Spaghetti Madness. I'll see you in about 20 minutes.
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?
idiot.
Hey.
Hey. Hey!
move it. There's a train coming.
do you not hear that horn?
let's go! I got a train!
move it!
back your car up! There's a train! - I can't go anywhere. Get out!
son of a bitch!
fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.
get out!
get off the track! Move!
let's get him out. - Get him out of there.
somebody help him. - You all right?
please, that guy's still in there.
you sure?
get him out of there!
will you look at that?
Ah, shit. - I'm all right. I'm okay.
all of you people...
...blocking the intersection...
...you're all idiots.
you threw the dude's car at her. And what's with the train?
why didn't you just go straight up in the air with the car?
you've obviously injured that poor woman.
she's right. She should sue you. - Yeah, she should sue you.
well, you should sue McDonald's because they fucked you up.
you're an asshole.
and I can smell that liquor on your breath.
because I've been drinking, bitch. - You're a drunk asshole!
you think you're such a hero. - Asshole!
you're nothing but an asshole. - We don't need you in this city.
some superhero you are! Fly off!
shut up!
don't you understand? I'm alive.
I get to go home and see my family. I should be dead right now, right here.
Yeah, he could've gone straight up. Obviously, you should've.
you know, and I was upside down for the train, but...
no. Thank you.
thank you very much, Hancock. Thank you.
thank you, Hancock.
you're not flying by the Valley, are you?
throw the ball!
Monte, one guy'll line up here, all right? Hike the ball.
this guy'll be right here and he says, "Hut!
this guy'll drop back. Hut! Drop back. Chuck it.
great. Thank you.
nice aim. The driveway would've been better, but...
what's going on, Dad? - Hey, buddy.
daddy's had a little bit of a day. Look at you, huh?
I want you to meet somebody.
this guy here, dragging Daddy's car into the driveway.
who's this? - Hancock.
that's right. Hancock, this is my boy, Aaron.
ray, what happened to the car? - Oh, boy.
you would not have believed it.
I came this close to getting hit by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...
he saved my life. I mean... Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.
believe that? I almost kissed a train.
saw my whole life flash before my eyes.
he saved your life? - He sure did. Thank you.
Hey, you good? - I am good, yeah.
all right. Keep it off the tracks. - I will, definitely.
hang on a... One second.
Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food? - Yeah.
you like meatballs? - No.
aaron, sweetheart, he has to go and do...
I love meatballs.
who's so busy they can't have a meal?
and it's on us. Please.
I'm not even gonna take no for an answer. Get inside the house.
why do you have an eagle on your hat?
do you like eagles?
this guy's like a little talking machine, huh?
we don't have a lot of guests over here.
look at that, huh? Hon, is the heat on?
no? All right.
we started Spaghetti Madness about two years ago.
we do it every Thursday, and we have not missed a Thursday in...
ever. - Yeah.
ever? That's a long time. - Yes, sir.
a very long time. - That's some good meatballs, boy.
Aaron.
your mama's calling you. - Yes, Mom?
no. His name is Aaron.
Hey, Aaron, how was school today? - Fine.
yeah? No more problems with that bully, Michael?
Michel. But not like a girl's name. - Michel. No, no, I know.
it's French. - Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...
Hancock? Michel is this neighborhood bully.
we've been trying to teach Aaron a little about conflict resolution. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that? - That's exactly right.
well, just never turn that one, all right?
never let them punk you.
got it, Mr. Hancock. - Aaron, eat.
the way you deal with bullies, you take your right foot...
...bring it right up and catch him in his little piss pump.
you don't have to do that, honey, okay? Seriously.
it's a good idea.
you aim straight and make sure he can't use that thing for nothing but a flap to keep the dust out of his butt crack.
okay, please, just stop.
michel is not a man, okay?
he's a little boy. And his parents happen to be going through a bad divorce. That's why he's acting up.
maybe you don't know this...
...but not everything in this world gets resolved with force.
not everything has to be bang... - I'm set.
...scream, blood, more blood. - Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.
she watches so much news that sometimes it gets to be a little too much.
you got a toilet? - Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.
did he just take the whiskey bottle to the bathroom?
do you want him to kill us all?
thanks for coming on in. Good, right?
very, yeah. - Wanna say goodbye to him?
Bye, Hancock. - Hey, all right, little buddy.
are you okay? - It was a joke.
come on, Aaron. - Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...
he got it. She didn't get it.
I owe you. You gave me my life back today.
hear me out. I'd like to return the favor.
do you know what I do? I'm in public relations.
you know what that is? Of course you do. We're image consultants.
we change the way people see products, companies, people, that stuff.
listen, I see you on the news and I see you out there today...
...and it can't feel good that people, you know, hate you.
it's good to meet you, Ray. - No, I'm sorry.
but hear me out.
people... Don't get me wrong, they should love you. They really should.
I wanna deliver that for you. It's the least that I can do.
you know, you're a superhero.
kids should ask you for your autograph.
people should cheer you on the streets.
what the hell are you pricks looking at?
no, no, they're not... It's all right.
they're not pricks, they're just people.
but I want you to give me one short pitch, you know?
that's all I ask. Okay?
you use...
put it under here?
put it right there. Perfect.
e-mail me or whatever. You just fly on over, I don't know.
I want you to think about it.
just be careful when you go. Sleep on it, all right?
you get back to me?
I'll be right here. All right.
please don't stare, you guys. He's kind of one of us.
what about AllHeart?
it's a nonstarter, babe, you know? I'm chasing windmills with that.
maybe I can't change the world but I can change this guy's life.
think about all the good he can do. - I think you're wasting your time.
you really hate him.
hate? I don't hate him, Ray. I don't even know the guy.
just look at the news. You can see what he does.
I think he just needs people to care, you know?
you see the good in everybody, Ray.
even sometimes when it's not there.
I have a feeling about this. Don't work with this guy.
I know this kind of guy. He breaks things.
Frankenstein
my bad. Everybody all right?
I'll go and get my mommy.
he is an asshole.
what's your name, boy? - Michel.
you know who I am? - My papa says you are an asshole.
well, that's not really a nice word to call a person, is it?
asshole? - Yeah.
because that could make someone very angry...
...and, you know, maybe hurt their feelings.
you behave like an asshole.
all right...
do you know Aaron?
wee, la petit asshole.
well, seems to be a pretty good kid.
just wanna ask you to lay off of him a little bit.
why, asshole?
you're gonna stop calling me that. - Asshole.
that's not my name. - Asshole.
call me a asshole...
...one more time.
asshole.
how about you, thickness?
goggles?
Hancock! You son of a gun, I knew you'd come.
ask Mary. I had a feeling.
I said, he heard me and he's ready for a change.
this is great. Did you do this? You come in a little hot?
I'll meet you in the house.
I know you don't drive, but... - Oh, damn it, Ray.
all right. You're all right. You're all right. You're all right.
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.
not okay. Okay? - He all right.
really not okay. This is some of the stuff we're gonna work on.
how do you think that conversation's gonna go down with his mom?
landing like that in the street's also on the uncool side.
no, that was already like that when I got here, Ray.
I live here. I know what the street's like.
we'll make those problems of the past.
I'm gonna teach you how to interface with the public.
Where's the wife? - Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.
Hancock, pulled some stuff up on YouTube.
surprisingly large amount of not-great stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.
what is this?
that's me trying to change the world.
unfortunately, not doing real well.
come on. Let's get to you.
this stuff was on YouTube.
everybody loves a Nutty Buddy, I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy. Back up, back up.
mom! Mom! Mom!
those are children.
we've been waiting a long time... - Get that camera out of my face.
you ever put out an apartment fire, Ray?
no, I haven't done that. I'm in P. R. - No. My ass was hot.
all right. How about this? This is Walter, the gray whale.
everybody remembers him stuck on the beach north of Zuma.
along comes Hancock.
Hancock!
I don't even remember that. - Yeah.
greenpeace does. Walter does.
this gets redundant after a while...
...but my basic diagnosis of your fundamental problem is...
do you wanna hear it? - No.
you're an asshole.
I know. I call it like I see it though.
it's not a crime to be an asshole but it's counterproductive.
but you are an asshole, don't you think?
be careful.
all right, how about this? I've been thinking about something.
this kind of goes to how you present yourself.
come on. Really? It's the middle of the day. What springs to mind...
...when you see this?
Homo.
what about that? - Homo in red.
norwegian homo. - I'll give you that.
let's move past the comics. Let's get into something a little deeper.
I think that deep down you behave badly because you're lonely.
I think deep down, you want people's acceptance.
come on, now. You save people's lives...
...and they reject you, and so you reject them back.
and it's a... And we're gonna switch that cycle.
we're gonna start fresh, start anew.
this is outstanding. If you turn some of this power into willpower...
and then he kicked it in. - Almost.
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs. I'm making lunch. Go change.
Hey, sweetheart.
have you been watching the news?
no, we've been working on... - Interfacing with the public.
this has been on all day. - That's very good.
the law is the law, Mr. Hancock, and you are not above it.
felony destruction of property...
...amounting to tens of millions of dollars, theft, and now this.
from where I sit, I see a selfish, self-absorbed man with a lot of muscle, but no regard for anyone but yourself.
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.
you are not above the law.
you have failed to show at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.
anybody else would be held in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.
you may be a superhero, but let me tell you this:
you're not nearly as strong as the U. S. Constitution.
bank on it, buddy.
we do not condone the t...
genius.
things just got real. This is exactly what we need.
there's a DA trying to figure out how to put you in jail.
bitch can try. - I say you go.
people take you for granted. Make people miss you.
people don't like you, Hancock. - I do.
two weeks, you know? The public will be clamoring for you.
when they do, we'll be ready.
worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and you just, you know, fly out of there.
what do you got to lose?
I apologize to the people of Los Angeles.
my behavior has been improper, and I accept the consequences.
I ask my fellow Angelenos for their patience and understanding.
you're an asshole, Hancock!
asshole!
life here can be difficult for me.
after all, I'm the only one of my kind.
during my incarceration, I will be participating in alcohol- and anger-management treatment.
you're a drunk bum!
you deserve better from me. I can be better. I will be better.
all right.
good morning, ladies. Welcome to your new home...
it is the duty of each of you to remember your inmate serial number.
turn to your right.
turn to your left.
okay, scumbags. Let's go.
give me the hand, playboy.
california STATE PRISON JOHN HANCOCK
I see you, punk!
Oh, I get it.
I put some... Most of you in here.
Yes, you did.
I can understand you feeling some kind of way about that.
what?
so I'm gonna do me and I'm gonna let you do you.
I don't want no trouble.
all right?
I just wanna go to my cell.
that ain't gonna happen. - Nope.
excuse me.
excuse me, please.
deadly.
if you don't move, your head is going up his ass.
y'all fellas sure you wanna ride this train?
choo, choo, asshole.
get him out! Get him out!
did you shove a man's head up another man's ass?
we're gonna... We're gonna circle back to that.
the DA's office wants your sentence to run eight years.
it's a big number, but not something we didn't anticipate.
you know, our plan is... What are you doing?
it sounded like you said they want me to spend eight years in this shithole.
eight is more like four and a half with good behavior.
but it's irrelevant because with you out of the picture...
...and with the crime rate going up through the roof...
...the DA and the cops, they're all gonna call for your immediate release.
they're gonna demand it. Where are you going? Sit down.
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.
stop it. Hancock. - Move.
Hancock! - Get back!
you're being a coward!
who you talking to? - I'm talking to you.
who are you talking to, Ray? - Stop pretending that you do not care.
you have a calling. You're a hero, Hancock.
you're gonna be miserable the rest of your life until you accept that.
trust me. Trust this plan, this process. Just stay in here.
when they call, a hero's what we're gonna give them.
how we gonna do that, Ray?
all right, guys, let's start sharing.
don? You had something? - Yeah.
Yeah, I think I might've had a little bit of a breakthrough.
good for you.
Yeah, I mean, I realized that breaking necks is... It's easy.
but I'm sitting there and I'm staring at myself in the mirror...
...and I thought, "This is tough." - Yeah, it sounds tough.
why do you always laugh?
picturing you looking at the mirror. It would scare the shit out of me.
every time I'm talking, he completely ruins the cycle.
now, let's watch the crosstalk.
I'm not gonna share anymore if he keeps doing that.
no, no, no.
keep sharing. - Let's move on.
Mr. Hancock, do you wanna share today?
pass.
your landing is your first impression. It's your superhero handshake.
don't come in too hot, okay? Don't come in too boozy.
and don't land on a $ 100, 000 Mercedes. All right?
people have to be happy that you've arrived.
Mr. Hancock, your share.
pass.
so you've used the door and the building's still intact.
people are happy that you've arrived. They feel safe.
there's an officer and he's done a good job...
...so tell him he's done a good job.
what the hell did I have to come for if he's done a good job?
Oh, man!
KBLA radio, AM 850.
today's big story, no surprise here: Hancock. What's your take?
I, for one, have had enough of this guy.
I'm glad he's doing time around bars and I hope they don't let him off easy.
let my cousin Pookie out.
I see you don't wear a bulletproof vest, security officer.
I respect your courage...
...because bullets don't bounce off you, they bounce off me.
this city is being run by gangs and drug dealers.
Hancock makes them shake in their boots.
he doesn't tie a pretty ribbon around it, but he gets the job done.
besides, he's hot.
let me hear you say it. Let me hear you say, "Good job.
G...
goo...
Mr. Hancock, would you like to share?
pass. - Good.
good.
good j...
good j...
good job.
good job.
jail watch, day five, and true to his word, Hancock remains incarcerated.
meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.
the L. A.P. D. Is reporting increases of up to 30 percent in the last five days that Hancock has been behind bars.
Hancock! Hey, Hancock! - Hey, little buddy.
Hancock. We brought you something! - Hey, hey.
Hey, what's up, Hancock?
Where's...? Where's Ray?
no, it's just us. Ray's working.
aaron really wanted to come and see you...
...so we just dropped by with some Spaghetti Madness.
I should probably let the guard check for keys...
no, no. Here. - Okay. Here you go.
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?
just dig in. - Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.
that's a good meatball. - Thanks, Hancock.
ray is a good man.
whatever this is you're doing, don't let him down.
okay?
okay. Well, we should probably go, buddy.
already? I wanna stay with Hancock. - Yeah. Sweetheart...
...we have to go. Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.
here, Hancock. It's my favorite one, and I want you to have it.
that was very sweet. - Thanks, Mom.
come here.
Mr. Hancock, would you like to share?
pass.
all right. Phillip?
I love you guys, man.
we love you. - We love you too, Phillip.
for when they call.
I ain't wearing that, Ray. - Yes, you are.
Oh, no, I'm not. - No, you are.
actually, I'm not, Ray.
you think you're not, but you are.
I will fight crime butt-ass naked before I fight it in that, Ray.
you know, you have fought naked. We've got that. That's on YouTube.
Hancock, this is a uniform. A uniform represents purpose.
doctors, policemen, firemen, right?
it represents a calling. - It's been two weeks.
yeah? - Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.
just be patient. You gotta trust me on this. All right?
perimeter breach, perimeter breach.
asshole!
you're still a fake-ass punk.
Damn!
Mr. Hancock?
it's your share.
pass.
come on, man, try it. Let it out. - Come on, John.
I don't have nothing.
there's nothing on your mind? Come on, John.
it's cool, man. - Come on.
come on. - Do it.
first time for everything.
feels good to release, now. - Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.
come in here all these days, you don't have anything to share?
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.
all right. Thanks for sharing.
okay. - Thank you.
all right. - That's awesome.
that's a clap. Yeah. - There you go. Good share.
Hey, Hancock.
come on, get up.
you got a phone call. - Take a message.
it's the chief of police.
he says he needs your help.
the trapped officer's husband is Corporal Joseph Blake...
...who was killed last year in Iraq...
...leaving her two small children. We are waiting for the latest news...
...but apparently there are three suspects and...
what's going on?
I'm out!
stay down! Stay down!
stay down!
get out! - Get down!
get it down!
let's go! Everybody's gotta get back! Let's go!
back! Move!
we got perimeters set up on the north, east and south sides.
the west side is open.
don't break the building, don't break the building.
what?
it's a little tight. What you got?
bank job. I got at least eight hostages. Four bad guys.
officer pinned down. We can't get to her.
they been spraying the hell out of us all morning. And...
they got some kind of heavy artillery. Fifty caliber or bigger.
I don't know if that matters to you. - No, I'm good.
good job.
good job.
really, good job.
get down!
it's Hancock!
take him out!
good job!
do I have permission to touch your body?
Yes!
it's not sexual.
not that you're not an attractive woman.
you're a very attractive woman... - Get me the fuck out of here!
he's on the move!
he's moving, he's moving!
good job.
are you hit anywhere? - My leg!
Hancock! - Good job.
you said that. I need you to end this now.
check the flanks.
secure the perimeter.
spread out!
they're gonna come around the back.
what happened to him?
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
what is happening?
I heard you was in the slammer. - Out early.
Why's that? - Good behavior.
do you know what this is?
I'm guessing it's some kind of detonator-type deal.
there's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped to each and every one of them.
this is a spring-loaded dead man's switch.
if my thumb comes off it:
boom!
and now, since we've had a little change of plan...
...between the police showing up...
...and you sucking out all of my associates...
...I want you to break into the vault.
you'll find three quarter-ton pallets of small bills inside.
thirty million dollars.
and you're gonna carry it for me.
you are gonna get me safely away from here with the money...
...or else they'll be cleaning up these hostages with a mop.
I'm gonna have to say no to that.
I'm really trying to turn over a new leaf.
I will blow up this entire building, you asshole.
I really don't like that word.
I will blow them sky-high...
...and their blood will be on your hands.
do you hear me, asshole?
call me a asshole...
...one more time.
ass...
go, go, go. Move in! - Go on, you're safe!
let's go. Let's go. - Take it right in. Let's go.
bring it around now.
keep your hand on that trigger.
good job. - No. You, good job.
thank you. - Good job.
Hancock!
say hi to your fans. Look what you got.
here we go. This way.
Hancock. At the bank today, intense. - Thank you.
smile.
good job, Hancock!
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here, huh?
Hancock, meet these guys. This is Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.
gigantic fans. Insane!
these guys are partners at the biggest ad firm.
you never call, man.
I have called. A couple of times. - Water under the bridge, man.
could you guys get used to this or what?
how'd you two meet?
I was married once before.
first wife...
...she died giving birth to Aaron.
it's another dinner. But... But...
so there I am, I'm with this beautiful little baby.
I don't know what the hell to do.
and I was in the supermarket...
...and I'm in the baby aisle...
...and I've got a brand of diapers in each hand.
I'm staring at them, but I don't know how I'm gonna get through the day.
an angel...
...sees me.
she knew. She was... She gave me this look.
and even in the trance I was in, I knew that somebody somewhere was throwing me a little rope.
you know?
starting that day, you really put my life back together. Right?
you're drunk. - So? Come here.
what about you, buddy?
you're from another planet, aren't you?
no, man, I'm from Miami.
you didn't come in on, like, a meteor or...?
Nope. Woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember.
government hospital, yes? Experimenting on you and...
no, Ray. Regular old Miami emergency room.
come on. - My skull was fractured.
they told me I tried to stop a mugging.
somebody knocked you out. - I guess I was a regular guy before...
...and when I woke up, I was changed.
the hospital nurse tried to put a needle in my arm...
...and it just broke against my skin.
and then my skull healed in, like, an hour.
the doctors were astounded...
...and they wanted to know my story.
just like you. But I couldn't tell them. I don't know who I am.
amnesia.
you know, the blow to the head. - Yeah, well, that's what they figured.
you don't remember anything? - No.
only thing I had in my pocket was...
...bubble gum...
...Two movie tickets.
boris Karloff, Frankenstein.
but no ID, nothing.
I went to sign out, the nurse asked me for my John Hancock.
I actually thought that's who I was.
how come I didn't hear any of this, didn't read about it in any newspapers?
it was probably in the papers 80 years ago.
eighty years ago?
Oh, I don't age. This is it.
that's nice. - Gotta wonder, though:
what kind of bastard must I have been that nobody was there to claim me?
I mean, I'm not the most charming guy in the world...
...so I've been told, but...
...nobody?
whoever it was they'd be dead by now, anyway.
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?
Yeah. Too much wine.
I am a lightweight.
I'm sorry.
you ain't do nothing.
this was a nice dinner, Ray.
it was a good one. - Almost call this fun.
that didn't tire you out, coming up the stairs?
not really. - I'm real spinny.
could've just flown me upstairs.
I could've done without that. - Get your shoes off here.
all right, that's all you're getting off of me though.
you believe in me, don't you, Hancock?
of course, Ray. I believe in you. - Help me up here.
I got something to say to you.
listen to me. This is important.
you are like a Dodger Dog.
it's something people don't think they're gonna like...
...then they try it and they love it, right? It hits the spot.
it's good for the soul. You're like the world's Dodger Dog.
I don't know. But you know what I mean, right?
you're gonna do great.
you're gonna fix everything.
you get some sleep, Ray. - You sleep tight too.
Hancock tucking me in.
all right, he's asleep.
okay, thanks. Good night. - Good night.
look, I just don't want you to think that... That Ray...
...you know, drinks like that, because...
Oh, no. - This was just kind of a celebratory night. - No, I understand.
Yeah, I know that. - Okay.
the damn babysitter never cleans up after herself.
you have a bruise on your hand.
Yeah, I don't... I don't know what that is.
I've been feeling kind of funny.
you...
you should go.
getting late.
if Ray finds out about me...
...you're dead.
Joan, we're gonna take care of that, okay? Don't you worry.
Hi, honey.
breakfast?
Hancock sneezed, huh?
can you believe it? It's amazing that you slept through that.
you're a good sleeper. - Holy shit.
I'm not gonna say I told you so, but...
you told me he was gonna sneeze a hole through the house?
I just said him being around...
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that? Thanks.
Oh, God, you strong man. - I got it.
but you don't worry about anything.
I already apologized to the neighbors. Called State Farm.
everything is taken care of.
you just...
...enjoy that breakfast.
what's this? Are we going on vacation? Are we?
just the three of us.
end of the summer? - Tonight.
tonight? - Spur of the moment.
tonight might be a little tough. - Come on. The three of us?
me in a bikini?
sounds good. - Let's go somewhere.
knock, knock.
Gesundheit.
I was just telling Ray here, I hope you're done sneezing...
...because I don't think our house could take much more...of your sneezing.
Yeah, sometimes I sneeze when there's dust...
...or if I get really surprised.
that's unfortunate. This is Kilbourne.
Mike? How you doing?
it was great to see you too.
Yep. Well...
right. Go ahead, shoot.
okay. I got a pen right here.
right. No, I know.
it's right here in my hand.
I am warning you.
all right, go ahead.
okay, good.
now... And that's still in 310, right?
hang on one second.
do me a favor?
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.
we're gonna talk.
go away.
well, it is something that I'm really excited about.
I'm gonna do this all day. - Shut... Shut up.
I... I suppose...
fine. We'll talk, okay? - We will.
and when we're done talking, you go away and you leave my family alone.
my place at 4: 00. - Whatever.
it means... Well, I'd rather not talk numbers now.
I'd like to save them for the pitch. So let's just set a time.
that's good with me. I will see you then. All right.
Yeah, 3: 30. Great.
hon, is it hot in here?
he hurt you, didn't he?
come on, use your words.
how did it make you feel?
sore.
bad.
bad.
it's because he took your power. And you have to get your power back.
and no one will give you your power back. You have to go out and take it.
you understand me?
we're gonna go find Hancock...
...and get your power back.
well, I'm here.
Yup.
you wanna do it? - Do what?
I don't have time for this, okay? You ask the questions...
...I answer them honestly and then you leave L. A.
I ain't leaving L. A.
all right, all right. Jeez.
don't.
ask.
you and I. - "You and l" what?
we're the same. - No.
I'm stronger.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
who are we?
gods, angels. Different cultures call us by different names.
now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."
are there more of us? - There were.
they all died.
it's just the two of us.
what is this?
who are we to each other?
we're brother and sister. - That's a lie.
no, I'm your sister. - That is a lie.
I'm your sister. - That is a lie.
sisters don't kiss brothers the way you kissed me last night.
you're lying, deal's off.
let's go see how Ray feels about this.
get your ass back here!
I'm telling!
the AllHeart symbol will be known globally...
...as a symbol...
...that represents companies that are committed to changing the world.
they can give away their sustenance goods, okay?
food, drugs, power, clothing, for free.
we were talking about Hancock... - Number two.
you stay away from me and my family.
you are not gonna do this to me again.
what? I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey! - I love you, Hancock!
it can't work. It always ends the same way.
persia. Greece. Brooklyn.
Brooklyn? I've never been to Brooklyn.
I have put up with your bullshit for 3000 years...
...and I am done! Done, you listening?
I don't know what you're talking about! - Finally, I am happy!
you are not gonna mess with that! - I don't know what you're talking about!
I hate to burst your little crazy-lady bubble...
...but it must not have been all that great because I don't remember you.
call me crazy...
...one more time.
cuckoo.
all right, hold it. All right.
you better not hit me with that truck.
for companies to qualify, they need to prove they are a leader in the global...
we wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.
they're committed to bettering the world.
they can do this in four ways. This is how they...
the most important thing with AllHeart is brand recognition.
I've mocked up these examples here...
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.
Oh, no.
we need maximum exposure, market penetra...
is it snowing?
stop. Stop it.
stop. Stop. Stop! All right, let's just...
get off me!
get off me!
stop. Stop!
get off!
get off me! - Listen to me!
I hate you! - I am sorry!
whoever I am, whatever I did... Look at me.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.
you are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
Oh, my God.
why were you flying? You were flying, Mary.
Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray. - Okay, I was flying.
and I'm very strong as well.
it's just the way we are. - "We"?
me and him, it's just us now. The others paired up and died.
you didn't say anything about pairing up at the trailer.
you were at his trailer. - This is hard to explain.
great, I'm all ears. - Me too.
do me a favor, just give me and my wife one moment.
don't bring it here, Ray. - The adults are talking.
technically speaking...
...he's my husband.
holy shit.
what? - We broke up decades ago.
long before you were born. He just can't remember.
but you can, right? You knew?
that's something you bring up on a first date, Mary.
I don't like to travel. I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal.
those are some things you give a heads-up on.
whatever we are, we were built in twos, okay?
we're drawn to each other.
no matter how far I run, he's always there.
he finds me. It's physics.
are you saying that you two are fated to be together?
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.
and the one thing I learned...
...fate doesn't decide everything.
people get to choose.
and you chose to let me think I was here alone.
I didn't think you'd miss what you didn't remember.
great. Now what?
I didn't plan for this.
prison authorities confirmed...
...that the prisoner uprising was led by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...
...who was also the leader of last week's Spring Street bank robbery.
at least eight prisoners are not accounted for.
more information on the prison riot in Norwalk.
construction workers at the prison were knocked unconscious.
the prisoners stole the workers' clothes...
...and it's feared at least some of them have escaped.
Parker is considered a criminal mastermind.
he is very effective at using psychological persuasion to organize criminals from different backgrounds.
he is a former psychology professor from Stanford University.
while there, he organized a notorious criminal network...
...comprised of graduate students from diverse...
ninety-one ten.
ninety-one ten? You gotta be shitting me.
ninety-one ten.
Highway robbery.
911
what? - I'm taking the money.
I can relate to that.
you know? If you want something...
...nobody can stop you from taking it...
...you just take it, right?
I like that.
but can you take it?
my Zagnut bar versus your gun.
sorry about your window.
I need Room 1020. - Clear!
I need Room 1020.
I need IV line, blood quality, CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...
Where's his IV line?
that's not gonna work. - I'm in.
what's happening?
this just in. John Hancock has been rushed to Los Angeles General Hospital.
Hancock is in serious condition with multiple gunshot wounds.
no story yet as to how this happened to him...
...but we will continue to cover this story live. Reporting live from L. A...
any lead on the assailant? - Mr. Embrey!
just a couple of questions, sir, please.
can you describe how it happened?
from what I've heard, he was trying to stop a robbery.
do you know if special ammunition was used in the gun that shot him?
not that I'm aware of.
could this have to do with the mysterious woman?
he was seen battling her. - I do not have that answer.
could this woman be more powerful than Hancock?
here are the lab results for 209.
you're becoming mortal.
it's us being close to each other.
it's never happened this fast before.
you have to leave.
the further you get from me, the better you're gonna feel.
you'll start getting your powers back...
...and be flying and breaking things...
...and saving people before you know it.
well, it's like I said, we were built in pairs.
and when we get close to our opposites, we lose our power.
Why? - So we can live human lives.
love, connect...
...grow old, die.
what happened to us?
summer of 4 B. C.
we were becoming mortal, like now.
they came after me with swords.
but you saved me.
1850
they set our house on fire.
you pulled me out of the flames.
eighty years ago.
what happened then?
we were living in Miami...
...and a new movie was playing in town.
Frankenstein.
and after...
...we walked down Flagler Street...
...and you took my hand, and you held it so tight.
and they attacked us in an alley.
they hit you so hard. There was so much blood.
they wouldn't let me ride in the ambulance with you.
and by the time I got to the hospital, you were awake.
but you didn't know me.
so I left.
every time we're together...
...they come after you through me.
you're built to save people more than the rest of us.
that's who you are. You're a hero.
the insurance policy of the gods.
keep one alive. You.
to protect this world.
Mary!
mom!
Mary! - Stay down!
okay.
Mary?
stop.
Oh, no! No! Please!
stay down.
Hey! Mary!
let's go, get her up!
come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.
morphine. - Here. Help in here!
hold her down. Hold her down.
hold her down.
hold her down.
you want the monitor now? - Stay calm.
hold her, hold her, hold her. - Need EKG leads.
upon us all, Hancock.
you're no different.
time to shut her down, Hancock.
it's been a nice run.
Oh, we are all sincerely gonna miss you.
but it is time for you to move on.
and maybe to a happier place.
you can thank me if you want to...
...superhero.
you didn't!
Aaron!
one MONTH LATER - What about Attila the Hun? - Completely cross-eyed.
cross-eyed? - Yep.
all right, what about Queen Elizabeth?
needy. - J. F. K? What about him?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah"? Anything more?
not like that. I was in Cuba for the whole missile thing.
Yeah, hang on.
Hello? - Ray.
Hey, I've been trying to call you.
Yeah, I was out of cell range.
are you outside? - Yeah.
look up. - All right, I'm looking up.
I'm looking up.
baby? - What?
you're gonna change the world.
good job, Ray. - Oh, my God, Ray.
Hey. Look up.
Hancock.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.
will I get in trouble for that?
NYPD - Freeze! - Don't move!
Oh, my God! Sam! No! - Drop your weapon, sir!
get back! Get back! Get back!
drop it! - Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!
get back! I'm not playing.
get back. Get back!
damn, Handjob. Where you come from?
all right, relax. Just tell me what you need.
tell them cops to take their guns off of me.
all right. - Tell them to take the guns off me.
just take them off. Lower your weapons.
you're gonna get us out of here with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.
now let's make it happen, asshole.
the END
Victor.
Victor!
Victor, come on!
bad dog.
Oh, Carles!
Oh, hi.
Oh, what have you been doing?
there's South American stamps on here.
you must know somebody in Uruguay, Mr. Razaghi.
sort of.
I hope it's good news.
thank you.
we do not see the need for an authorized biography of Jules Gund at this time, nor at any time in the future"?
why would they deny me authorization?
it's not like everyone in the world is working on a biography of Jules Gund.
which one is Oaroline Gund?
the widow.
there's a daughter too, but she didn't sign.
so who's Arden Langdon?
she's the uh... mistress, I guess.
Adam Gund, that's the brother.
and Ocho Rios is the place where they all lived together when Jules Gund was alive.
that's quite a setup:
the brother, the widow, the lover, a daughter.
that's probably why they don't want to authorize a biography.
it's too tortured and incestuous.
wait.
your request has prompted much discussion amongst the trustees.
that could mean they don't all agree.
you'll have to go to Uruguay.
what?
after that letter?
Onfront the three executors and make them change their minds.
it may be easier than you think.
but they said "no."
you know perfectly well that without getting their permission, there's no fellowship, no money, no biography, and no new contract for you at the university.
Omar, you'll never get another teaching job.
and what else can you do?
nothing.
exactly.
I forgot to heat the milk.
do you think it matters?
I've never heard of a sublet that comes with a dog, and one with such an elaborate diet.
how could you do that, fall in a puddle?
it wasn't a puddle.
it was quicksand.
for you, it's quicksand.
for everyone else, it's a puddle.
it's like you have this subconscious drive to fall in, to mess up.
I think I should come with you to Uruguay.
I've had more experience with things like that.
no.
I think I should go by myself, if I decide to go.
well, if you decide to go,
I think it would be better for us to do it together.
better for us individually and as a couple.
I think it'll be better for both of us individually and as a couple if I were to go by myself.
but I appreciate your offer.
you appreciate my offer?
Omar, it's me, Deirdre.
you don't appreciate my offer.
I almost drowned in quicksand.
I saw my life flash before my eyes, and I did not like what I saw.
I've decided to change my life.
I have to be, you know, more independent.
like other people.
I don't want you to be like other people, to change.
Oh, what's wrong, buddy?
you want to go outside? Let's go outside.
come on.
come on!
Oh. Buddy.
hopeless.
out you go.
if you fly to Miami first, it's nonstop from there to Montevideo.
but that's horribly expensive.
what about Victor?
he's not your dog.
we'll put him in a pound.
most of them have a 30-day grace period.
you can redeem him when you get back.
Deirdre, he's part of the house-sit.
I'm responsible for him.
we can't just throw him in the pound.
Ah, this is better.
from Houston to Sao Paulo, then Montevideo.
for some reason, it's much cheaper.
Ah, it takes much longer.
don't do that now.
I'm hurt.
senor.
sí. - Por favor.
are you coming to Ocho Rios?
that's my house.
you speak English.
of course.
and Spanish.
I'm Omar.
omar Razaghi.
I'm Portia.
why are you coming to Ocho Rios?
I want to write a book.
I want to write a biography about Jules Gund.
have you heard of him?
he was my father.
your father?
this is Omar.
he's writing a book.
this is my mother.
Mrs. Gund?
I'm Omar Razaghi.
I wrote you the letter about the biography.
my name's Arden Langdon.
Caroline...
she's Mrs. Gund.
but we wrote to you.
we said no.
we very definitely said no.
Yes, that's why I'm here.
I'm hoping you'll change your minds.
I guess I should have written first.
it was very wrong of me to come like this.
I have to find a hotel.
where?
there's nothing except this place for miles and miles.
I can sleep outdoors in the garden, if you'll let me.
don't be ridiculous.
now that you're here, there's nowhere else for you to go, so till we can get you back into town, we'll have to let you stay.
Really?
mad women and Englishmen:
why they would want to walk here in the sun is beyond me.
of course, those two ladies are always beyond me.
Oan you help me with my cravat, please?
you know, I've always liked this cravat.
I bought it in Venice in 1966.
I must have been happy at the time.
otherwise, why would I have bought such a beautiful thing?
I look very handsome in that.
they're walking like...
they're bringing important news.
Oh, what news?
great tidings at Ocho Rios.
they do look serious, don't they?
supposing we...
stuck by our decision to refuse authorization.
then he shall have come very far for nothing.
Yes, but he can still write the biography without authorization.
that is, without our help and consent.
that would give him quite a free hand, wouldn't it?
to make up things, to make up stories, twist the facts.
you know, once these people, these biographers turn against you, they can become quite vicious.
Oh, he didn't look as if he could ever be that.
how do you know?
you only saw him for five minutes before at once inviting him to stay.
he looked so tired and helpless somehow.
and young and handsome.
Oh, really?
that has nothing to do with it.
anyway, Jules said he didn't want a biography of himself.
he said it was like having one's corpse publicly exhumed.
Oh, when did he say that?
in a letter to me years ago.
my god.
well, if we were held accountable for the things we wrote in letters millions of years ago, my dear, where would any of us be?
but he must have told you other things.
um, for instance, that he would be married and faithful to you forever and ever.
he was.
he stayed married to me.
and Arden didn't count, or Portia?
oaroline didn't say that.
the days pass, and we live together,
oaroline and I, and we manage it.
quite well, I think.
and now this.
Adam's so moody nowadays.
it's because of you.
he's afraid you'll leave him.
I used to live like that, always afraid that Jules would leave me.
he'd get into those black moods, not speak to me for days on end, not to anyone, not to Oaroline.
and I thought that she'd turn against me and get him to send me away.
where would I go?
where would I go?
that's all in the past.
Yes, it's strange.
everything's easier.
but now when some stranger arrives...
is he young and handsome?
it depends what you mean by that.
Oan you find any more teaspoons?
how can we just send him away?
tell him, "Good-bye; go home"?
we're not.
we're even letting him stay in the house.
we're being very friendly.
but then he might start to think we've changed our minds.
that's his problem.
I can be friendly without changing my mind.
well, he must have come here with such hope.
let's think about this.
a biography would stimulate interest in Jules' work, and that is something that we, as his executors, should encourage.
anyway, let's not make any hasty decisions, shall we?
my decision's made, and it's not hasty.
and Arden, for her own reasons, is on my side.
you are, aren't you?
Yes, you are.
so that's two against one, Adam.
well, I refuse to be guided by anything as stupid as democracy.
Portia.
mustn't disturb him.
are we gonna whisper all night?
he's come a long way. He must be tired.
Hello?
Hello?
I would like to speak to Omar Razaghi, please.
Dee!
Omar? - Hi.
how did you get this number?
you don't sound like Omar.
are you eating something?
Yes, bread and honey.
what?
honey.
darling, I miss you too.
but you won't be away long.
what's it like there?
I guess they're all pretty old.
I only hope they're not senile.
well, it might take longer than we thought.
OAn't you stop eating for a minute?
we have a very bad connection.
I told you to get a cell phone when you went down there.
it could have come out of the fellowship money.
are you there? Dee?
Omar?
Dee, are you there?
Hello?
thank you for the bread and the honey.
it was delicious.
it's from our own bees.
you know anything about bees?
bees.
I know they live in an apiary, a word derived from apís, which is Latin for "bee.
this is not very interesting information.
I can't believe it.
you read a book and you think all about the place, but you don't really think that it exists, let alone that you'll be there.
let me help you with that.
Ooming here, to Ocho Rios, was like coming to my first home, the first I ever had.
my parents were divorced, and I went back and forth between them.
no one really cared.
they both died in plane crashes, two different planes.
he was on his way to Prague for one of his not very successful films, and Mother was going to Hong Kong to get married... again.
all the years in America, my parents wanted to go back to Tehran, but it never worked out.
what did they do?
they were doctors, pediatricians.
they died four years ago.
first my mother, then my father after a few months.
so we're both orphans.
I think I was born an orphan.
I was 18 when Jules first brought me here.
that was ten years ago.
I was 18 ten years ago.
you and I are the same age, born at the same time.
we could be brother and sister.
twins.
only twins can be born at the same time.
I am Omar Razaghi.
Yes, I know who you are, my friend.
you're the biographer who showed up in spite of our letter.
and what are you giving him?
Oh, what... tea?
Oh, really, Arden, you'll have to give him something better than that to compensate for his long journey here and back.
how about some champagne?
Ohampagne?
at this time of day?
well, is there a special time of the day for champagne?
well, if so, it is now.
you're flirting with him.
what?
when you start opening up the beautiful secrets of your past...
I was born an orphan..."
that's flirting.
Caroline, try not to tease and provoke.
Oh, come on.
how often do we have a guest, even an uninvited one?
I may not make it back tonight.
why not?
business, as you know perfectly well.
I know your business perfectly well:
antique furniture, and some of it not so antique.
we need to raise some cash.
I know.
land taxes are due next month.
you have all this land;
you pay big taxes on it. - Mm-hmm.
you don't try to make it work for you.
sorry to spoil your mood, but try and be sensible.
I'm willing to be sensible, but can you imagine the other two ever agreeing to anything?
I mean, look what's happening with this foolish little biography, which, for all I know, could be to our advantage.
but Oaroline's only pleasure left in life is to say "no" to everything.
and as for poor Arden, well...
I wish you had more of a life of your own.
I do have.
Yeah.
it saddens me.
I think I was wrong to bring you here.
sorry.
Hola!
Hello, darling.
Ohampagne.
is there a little drop for me left, do you think?
Ah, the guest.
Hello, sir.
Mr. Ragazi received our letter, but as you see, it did not discourage him from coming to visit, so now we're all having a party.
well, then we must show Mr. Razaghi... Omar, may I?
Oh, please. - Omar.
Yes, we must show Omar what fine hosts we can be if, by some miracle, a guest is washed up on our lonely shore.
huh? What do you say?
a picture show.
Yes, why not?
portia proposes a picture show.
her one and only picture show.
go and show uncle Omar where the projector is.
Ocho Rios pictures presents...
the Gunds.
this is very unwise, as if we're suddenly his collaborators.
well, we're not showing him anything he doesn't already know, are we?
after all, Jules' book was not exactly reticent about our family affairs, was it?
Ohampagne.
I'll get you a glass.
so...
how are you, my dear?
peachy.
peachy.
our parents brought all this film footage with them from Germany, and they used to sit and watch it the way we're doing now, drinking champagne.
when they had to leave Germany and became refugees, they were allowed to settle here, in Uruguay on condition that they bought all this land and developed it for a mine.
my parents always traveled in style, even when they were fleeing Mr. Hitler and his Nazis.
always traveled first class.
we lived here the way they had done in Europe.
we lived in the past, their past.
they didn't want to know about the present, any present anywhere.
south America's very good for that if you're a rich foreigner.
that's my grandfather.
they never spoke German again...
not even to each other.
there's mysterious Aunt Sarah.
she left for India to follow her guru.
there she is, signing away the family fortune.
they went to Venice for their honeymoon.
and after that, they went every year for as long as it was still possible.
but then the gondola was the epitome of Europe, of their Europe.
they persuaded the gondolier to sell them his gondola.
they called it the honeymoon gondola and they had it shipped all the way from the Adriatic, right across the Atlantic, here to Montevideo.
their maddest and saddest enterprise maybe.
but you've heard all about our gondola from Jules' book.
it's still here with us, rotting in the boathouse.
buenos días.
I'm Pete.
you must be Omar.
Yes.
hello.
Hi.
I'm looking for the mill house.
miss Langdon said it was down this way somewhere.
Mr. Gund has invited me to lunch.
he has?
he hasn't told me.
I'm the one who does the cooking around here.
I haven't bought anything.
he'll have to take you to the parílla.
there is no other place.
do they take Visa?
don't worry about that.
Adam always picks up the tab.
he's very generous.
get in.
it's a mile away.
this is where I found him,
Jules, by that big palm.
I was the one who found him.
so near to the house?
come on.
blew the top of his head right off.
I'm glad it was me who found him and not one of the others.
the odd thing is that we all stayed here.
no, thank you.
anyway, here we all are...
including me.
where are you from originally?
from Tokunoshima.
a small island.
I was poor with no family.
when I was 14, someone liked me enough to take me with him to England.
here.
I find this old furniture and make it look older.
a lady comes twice a year from New York and buys it.
she says I have a good eye.
Adam used to work at Ohristie's in London.
Hello, Mr. Gund.
hello.
he sent me to a school there where I learned everything about furniture.
that was 25 years ago.
Yes.
we're about to have our silver anniversary, aren't we?
ready? Should we go?
I've ordered us a platter of grilled meat and some red wine.
not too much for me.
I'm a bit of a lightweight, I'm afraid.
Really? How sad.
what about all those drunken Persian poets of yours?
what about Hafez?
bring me a cup of red wine that is dark red and smells of musk...
"and smells like lust."
so now, about the biography.
please understand, unlike my two sisters-in-law, or the two ladies, I should say,
I'm on your side.
you are? - Entirely on your side.
see, I've been trying to explain to them that to revive an interest in Jules Gund and his work, a biography would be invaluable to us.
well, if only I could convince everyone.
I would be very respectful of the past, everyone's feelings.
my dear boy, he was my brother.
I knew him better than anyone.
I knew him when we were still tearing the wings off butterflies.
I was eight years older, but it was he who invented all the little torments an older brother inflicts on the younger.
we were both sent to school in England.
I was utterly miserable, but he, when in a system, was in his element.
I suspect it was there at school that he began to learn how to exert power over those who adored him.
it's that simple.
so we must work together, you and I.
we must co-conspire.
I hadn't thought of conspiring.
well, of course not.
Gracías.
this is Mrs. Van Euwen.
the chatelaine of Las Golondrinas, our local grand dame.
very grand.
local color, you know?
I told them all they would see was red meat.
Yes.
worse, why do you keep your new friend away from me?
Oh, yes, he's very beautiful, isn't he?
Yes, I thought you'd be interested.
this is... he's blushing.
Ooh! - This is Omar Razaghi.
he's come to do research on my brother's biography.
mucho gusto.
then you must research me.
I can tell you things about Jules that a brother could never know...
or a wife or even a mistress.
you should write his life, his and Pete's.
that a more interesting story, yeah.
go away. Go away.
thank you. - I go. I go.
you should come to Las Golondrinas.
have a sausage.
is it pork?
maybe.
I don't know.
you don't drink; you hardly eat meat.
um... well, as I said before,
I know I can trust you.
I feel I can ask you for your help as you're asking for mine.
like I said, I'll do anything.
wait, wait, this is non-literary.
it's nothing to do with the biography.
when our mother... that is, Jules' mother, my mother...
when our mother arrived here as a refugee, she brought with her from Germany some valuable things, her jewelry.
now, I have her jewelry.
and I would like to dispose of it, and I would like you to help me dispose of it.
is it legal?
is what legal?
taking these things out of the country?
no, it's moral.
they're my things.
they were my mother's.
when she arrived here, she hid them away.
because of her experiences in Germany, she trusted no one.
she didn't feel safe anywhere.
outside of this cocoon that they built here, why, she and my father didn't feel safe on this planet.
so after her death, very shortly after my father's,
I found the jewels.
do Arden and Caroline know about them?
Nope.
they know nothing of that history.
even Caroline hardly knew my mother.
she certainly knew nothing of what was precious to her.
so I took the jewels.
I felt I could assume that they were mine as Caroline, in due course, felt free to take what was hers.
from what your mother left?
with Caroline, it was what my brother left.
have you never thought, never suspected that there might be another book?
other than The Gondola?
it is well known, Jules Gund wrote only that one book.
well, he was working on another one when he died.
it is my theory that he died, or killed himself, because he couldn't write anymore.
or because of what he was writing or trying to write.
a psychological impasse.
Caroline has the manuscript?
I don't know. You have to ask her.
but that is not the subject of our present little talk, is it?
my jewels.
my need for money.
Ah, here's Pete.
hail to thee!
Oome upstairs. Follow me.
I want to show you something.
it is not for myself that I need the money;
it is for Pete, who may be free to leave me.
does he want to leave you?
he should.
he still has a chance at a better life than with me here.
you know, in order to bring him here to Uruguay,
I had to adopt him.
legally, he is my son.
come and sit down, please.
I'll do what you ask.
even though it's illegal and dangerous?
I think it's the right thing to do.
if you can trust me not to screw it up.
Ah, we shall see.
please, sit down.
so here's the treasure.
some of it is mixed up with my father's.
that's my father's watch.
mother used to keep them locked in the safe, but sometimes she'd take it out and wear it for me to show me.
and, uh...
I was her favorite, you know, her firstborn, her Adam, she called me.
of course, Jules could never get over that.
she would show me how she wore them and where.
this at the opera.
she had much smaller wrists than mine.
Wow. - It's beautiful.
go on, you can take it.
it's all right.
and these at the Burgtheater.
isn't that beautiful?
Oh, yes, and this little horse was for the races.
and she'd wear this attached to her cloche hat.
it's me, Omar Razaghi.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I'm just having my breakfast.
come in.
Oh. No, thank you.
you don't have to say anything nice about it.
no, I like it. It's very interesting.
it's only a copy.
that's all I do nowadays, is copies, copy the masters.
it's safer.
that way, I don't reveal anything.
it's what art does, even biography.
especially biography.
I would be very discreet.
I would absolutely respect your wishes as to what to reveal.
what if I were to tell you that Jules explicitly said he didn't want a biography of himself?
he wrote it to me in a letter.
I suppose you'd want to see that letter.
well, yes.
I'd like to very much.
and why would I show it to you?
I don't know anything about you, no more than you know about me or ever will.
what if I were to ask you, have you ever been in love, passionately in love?
see, you can't answer me.
you're not sure.
I am sure.
do you have a girlfriend?
a partner?
why do you want to know?
are you romantically involved?
Yes.
I suppose I am.
suppose?
that doesn't sound very positive, let alone passionate.
we've been together two years.
her name is Deirdre.
if it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here.
I mean, here in Uruguay.
I would have accepted your decision.
I would have given up.
I see.
sit.
so it is your friend Deirdre who made you come to change our minds.
and what if you can't change our minds?
what will she think?
she'll think you failed.
Yes.
and she'd be right.
I will have failed.
sometimes it's good to fail, to try but to fail.
there's nothing ignoble in that.
you don't understand.
everything depends on it:
my job, my career, maybe my relationship with my girlfriend.
you're so young.
are you sure that's what you want your life to be forever and ever:
that job, that career, that girlfriend?
I'll show you a real picture I painted.
it's Jules, only it's not him, not as he really was, which only I knew.
you don't see it because I couldn't paint it.
I wasn't good enough to paint it.
I suppose now you'll write how the widow of Jules Gund is sitting in a south American jungle painting atrocious paintings and slowly going mad or not so slowly.
I promise to write nothing you don't want me to write.
point is, I want you to write nothing.
if you could just give me one reason.
I don't have a reason.
as anyone will tell you, I am an unreasonable person.
Jules himself would have told you that if he'd still been here.
in fact, it's the very word he used when he felt I wasn't being accommodating enough to his arrangements.
you're so unreasonable, Caroline.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.
don't apologize.
no, it's good sometimes to hear another voice.
I was beginning to think that apart from our little group here, there was no one else left in the world.
do you want to hear how Arden met Jules?
Yes.
omar doesn't want to know that at all.
he's writing a book; he has to know everything.
um... I was traveling around Spain when I met some people going to Uruguay.
so I went with them, and they turned out to be a missionary group sent to convert the heathen of south America.
don't laugh.
our name was joyful noise.
and we went around in a bus and gave concerts in the street.
we never drew much of a crowd, but people listened very politely.
but by the time we'd finished, there was usually only one or two left.
but we went right on singing and playing.
Arden shook the tambourine.
anyway, one day, Jules stopped to listen.
and when we were through, he came up to me and said, "What are you doing?
and why are you doing it?
so I stopped.
and then I was born.
well, not quite so quickly, darling.
nine months later, anyway.
I'm packing a picnic lunch.
why are you going on a picnic?
I'm taking Omar to show him the gondola.
Why?
as if that gondola isn't the most ludicrous of all the ludicrous collected items here.
I don't feel that.
no...
you've changed your mind about the biography.
well, haven't you?
why shouldn't he write the biography?
he seems...
he's just the right person to understand Jules.
in what way is he the right person?
because he's good-looking and charming and because he's charmed you?
what is it?
I'm sorry.
it's just that what we decided before still stands for me.
maybe I shouldn't tell you this.
tell me what?
do you know he's in love with someone?
I didn't know that.
he told me he has a fiancée.
maybe they're not engaged, but he has a romantic attachment.
why are you telling me this?
because I thought you should know.
it has nothing to do with anything.
I never said that it had, but I wouldn't blame you.
you're lonely.
I'm not lonely.
or maybe I am and I didn't know it until there was a new person.
when do we ever see anyone or get to talk to anyone?
and now...
why are you talking to me like this?
why do you want to hurt me?
I don't want to hurt you.
I never wanted to hurt you.
Hola!
so you're off to see the gondola.
Oh, yes.
you'll be coming with us?
I've been there.
maybe we shouldn't go.
it's a long way.
uh, well, if you're not feeling up to it.
well, if you're not allowed to write the biography, there's no point in going.
and Caroline won't change her mind.
that's the way she is.
she has a much stronger character than I have.
that's not true.
Oh, but it is.
Jules used to say that any breeze could come and blow me any which way.
but actually, why shouldn't we go?
right.
why shouldn't we?
who won?
we did.
I have to go find Arden.
she is showing Omar the gondola.
without me?
they'll take you another time.
what if Omar goes away?
is he going away?
do you want him to stay?
definitely.
do you live alone?
Yes.
but you have a girlfriend.
Yes. I do.
what's her name?
her name is Deirdre.
she teaches at the same university.
what does she teach?
literature, like me.
she's a good teacher.
much better than I'll ever be.
the great Russians and German poets.
sorry, I'm being rude.
I'm not used to meeting new people, so I don't know how to behave anymore.
I shouldn't ask you all those questions.
but think of all the questions I want to ask you.
is all of this your land?
Pete keeps trying to make us sell some of it, or at least lease it for a vineyard or something.
and we could do with the money, but you see how we all are.
there's no quicksand here, is there?
a swamp you could sink into?
Oh, well, yes, there's lots of swamps.
so watch out.
what's wrong?
I...
I feel a bit strange.
OAn't be the altitude.
Oh, no, we're at sea level.
maybe you're just hungry.
come on.
maybe.
I want you to know,
I've changed my mind about the biography.
why should I be afraid of stirring up bad memories?
there aren't any.
there's Portia and this lovely place for her to grow up in.
I want you to write the book.
like Adam, I'm on your side.
I give you my... what is it?
my... my authorization.
you know, I came here to write one kind of book.
no, thanks.
and now it's turning into something different.
like, it's no longer about Jules but about you... all of you.
and your life here and even about me here with you.
does that make sense?
no? It doesn't?
well, not entirely, but you said you were feeling...
may I get in? - Yeah.
what are you looking at, Caroline? -The wind, mom.
they say a hurricane is coming.
I feel like I'm on a boat...drifting.
can I do anything for you, mom? Make anything easier?
Oh, sugar. There is nothing left to do.
it is what it is.
I'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open.
my mouth's full of... cotton.
there, there, miss Daisy.
you will scratch yourself to ribbons.
do you want any more medication, mother?
doctor said you can have as much as you want.
no need for anybody to suffer.
A...friend told me that...
she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother.
I wanted to... -It's OK.
I wanted to tell you...
how much I'm gonna miss you. Mom.
Oh, Caroline.
are you afraid? -I'm curious.
what comes next...
they built that train station in 1918.
our father was there the day it opened.
he said that...
a tuba band was playing.
they had the finest clockmaker in all of the South to build that glorious clock.
his name was
mr Gateau.
mr Cake.
he was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish and they had a son.
mr Gateau was from birth absolutely blind.
when their son was old enough, he joined the army.
they prayed God would keep him out of harm's way.
for months, he did nothing but work on that clock.
one day a letter came.
mr Gateau, done for the night, went up alone to bed.
and their son came home.
they burried him in a family plot where he would be with them when their time came.
mr Cake worked on his clock, laboring to finish.
it was a morning to remember.
Papa said there were people everywhere.
even Teddy Roosevelt came.
it's running backwards!
I made it that way.
so that perhaps the boys that we lost in a war might stand and come home again.
home to farm, work, have children, to live long, full lives.
perhaps my own son might come home again.
I'm sorry if I offended anybody.
I hope you enjoy my clock.
mr Cake was never seen again.
some say he died of a broken heart.
some say he went to sea...
excuse me, do you mind if I make a call?
somebody's watching my little boy. -Sure.
I hope I haven't disappointed you.
you couldn't disappoint me.
well, I...
I know I don't have much to show for myself.
the suitcase.
there's a diary.
this?
could you read it to me, dear?
is this what you wanna do?
I tried to read it a hundred different times...
mom, it's not exactly...
just the sound of your voice, darling. -OK.
it's dated "April 4th, 1985."
it says, "New Orleans."
this is my last will and testament.
I don't have much to leave, few possessions, no money really.
I will go out of this world the same way I came in, alone and with nothing. All I have is my story.
I'm writing it now while I still remember it.
my name is Benjamin. Benjamin Button.
and I was born under unusual circumstances.
the first world war had ended.
I've been told it was an especially good night to be born.
we won the war!
what are you doing here? -Thomas...
I'm afraid she's gonna die.-What?
that's enough! All of you! Get away from her!
I came as quickly as I could.
the streets are filled with people.
Thomas, promise me he has a place...
Yeah.
she gave her life for me.
and for that, I am forever grateful.
mr Button...!
Thomas! Thomas!
Thomas, where are you going?
Hey, what are you doing there!? What do you have there?
the air is sweet.
you look very handsome tonigh, miss Queenie.
handsome as I ever seen you.
the brown matches your eyes.-Oh, hush!
you ain't no slouch yourself.
Hambert's back in town. He came home legless...
but...he's home... I know you was sweet on him one time...
sweeter than I shoulda been...
miss Simone messed herself.
sweet Jesus! She got to stop doing that, or it's diapers for her.
I'll be right there! -C'mon,
Queenie'll be right there! -it's awful nice out here.
come out back for a moment, take your mind off things.
what in God's name...!?
Oh, the Lord done something here...!
I hope I didn't hurt it none, steppin' on it like that.
we best leave that for the police. -Oh, baby.
I'll go.
it's for sure nobody wanted to keep it. Come on, baby.
Quennie! Quennie! -Hold your water!
I'll be back.
she went and messed herself all over again...
Jane Childress, start her a bath.
and mind your own business, Mrs Duprey.
you'll be messing yourself soon enough.
somebody stole my necklace.
OK, Mrs Hollister, I'll be right with you.
go on back upstairs.
you are as ugly as an old pot, but you still a child of God.
Queenie, she won't go take a bath without you.
mercy... I'll be right there!
you just wait right here for me, okay?
my sister gave me those pearls. I can't find them anywhere.
somebody's been stealing my jewelry.
they are right here, Mrs Hollister. See?
right around your pretty white neck. Now come on.
your heart is strong.
you want to avoid any undue stimulation.
I trust you ladies will help me out with that?
I've never seen anything like it, nearly blind from cataracts.
I'm not sure if he can hear, bones indicate severe arthritis.
his skin has lost all elasticity and his hands and feet are ossified.
he shows all the deterioration, the infirmities not of a newborn, but of a man well in his eighties on his way to the grave. He's dying?
his body's failing him before his life's begun.
where did he come from? -It's my sister's child.
from Lafayette. She had an unfortunate adventure.
poor child, he got the worse of it. Come out white.
there are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, Queenie.
no room for another mouth to feed here.
the Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is. A baby...
you said he don't have long.
Queenie, some creatures aren't meant to survive.
no, this baby here is a miracle, that's for certain.
just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see.
now listen! Listen up here! We gonna have us a visitor that's gonna be staying with us for a little while.
my sister had a child, but she couldn't see right by it. So...
he's known as...
Benjamin.
Benjamin... He's not a well child, so we're gonna have to take good care of him.
I had ten children, there's not a baby I can't care for.
let me see him.
Oh, God in heaven, he looks just like my ex husband.
look, he's prematurely old.
doctor Rose said he ain't got much more time on this earth.
join the club.
smile!
Hambert sends his remembrances to you.
are you right out of your mind?
I know you ain't got all the parts it takes to make one of your own, but this ain't yours to keep, may not even be human kind.
mr Weathers, come back here!
please.
you never know what's comin' for you.
it seemed I'd found a home.
is any of this true?
you have such a lovely voice.
mom, there's an ancient streetcar token.
that clock just kept going, year after year after year...
I didn't know I was a child. -Same old crap every day.
I thought I was like everyone else there.
an old man in a twilight of his life.
stop bangin' that fork. It's used for eating, not for playin' with.
and use your napkin, please Mr. Benjamin.
Queenie!
Hey, boy!
I always had a healthy curiosity.
what was up the street, or around the next corner?
Benjamin! That is dangerous. Come back over here!
stay put, child!
I loved her very much. She was my mother.
Momma... momma!
some days I feel different than the day before.
everybody feels different about themselves one way or another.
but we're all goin' the same way.
just taking different roads to get there, that's all.
you're on your own road, Benjamin.
momma, how much longer I got?
just be thankful for what you're given.
you already here longer than you supposed to.
some nights, I'd have to sleep alone.
I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing.
all those people sleeping.
I felt safe.
it was a place of great routine.
every morning at 5: 30 no matter the weather,
general Winslow, US army retired, raised the flag.
Mrs Sybil Wagner, once an opera singer of some note, well, she sang Wagner.
alright, c'mon.
we gotta put some life into these old sticks for you.
get you walkin'. Come on.
no matter the season, supper was served promptly at 5: 30.
Mol-asses... -Molasses.
molasses.
I learned to read when I was five.
my grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor.
he brought home every play for me to read.
kind keepers of my weak decaying age let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
even like a man new haled from the rack.
so fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
and these gray locks, the pursuivants of death, argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
you thought I was plain ignorant, didn't you?
the actor my grandfather worked for was John Wilkes Booth.
he killed Abraham Lincoln.
you never know what's coming for you.
on saturday nights, momma would make me go to church.
Benjamin!
Amen! -Healing Through Faith
what can I do for you, sister?
her parts are all twisted up inside, she can't have little children.
Lord, if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb.
out damnable affliction! Praise God!
Hallelujah!
and what's this old man's irrediction?
he's got the devil on his back, trying to ride him into the grave before his time.
out, Zebuchar! Out, Beelzebub!
how old are you?
seven, but I look a lot older.
God bless you. He's seven!
now, this is a man with optimism in his heart! -All right!
belief in his soul! -Yes!
we are all children in the eyes of God! -Yes!
we are gonna get you out of that chair.
and we're gonna have you walk. -It's all right.
in the name of God's glory, rise up!
come on!
come on, man!
now God is gonna see you the rest of the way.
he's gonna see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane.
he's gonna see that you walk from faith and divine inspiration alone!
now walk.
don't touch him!
rise up, old man!
rise up like Lazarus!
I said rise up!
Yes!
say hallelujah!
walk. Walk on.
now, when I look back on it, it was miraculous.
but you know the saying:
the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
praise be to the Lord on the highest...!
there was so many birthdays.
so we wouldn't run out, we would spare the candles.
Queenie, you know I don't like birthdays and I don't like cake.
and death was a common visitor. People came and went.
you always knew when someone left us.
there was a silence in the house.
Sybil Wagner 1847-1925
it was a wonderful place to grow up.
I was with people who had shed all the inconsequences of earlier life.
left wondering about the weather, the temperature of a bath, the light at the end of the day.
for everyone that died, someone would come to take their place.
I've been married five times.
my first wife and I are captured by neighbor tribe of cannibals.
we escaped across the river.
my wife, she can't swim, so, sadly, she eaten.
my second wife steps on a cobra and dies.
it was very bad luck to be married to me.
that's Mr Oti. He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine.
the next summer I'm captured with six others by Baschiele tribe. -He's a pigmey.
they trade us for pigs, shoes and beer to a very strange american man.
I hear you're not so old as you looking.
you just foolin' everybody.
what's the matter, did you get Madjembe?
what's madjembe? -Worms.
I don't think I have worms. This is just how I am.
come, let's get a cold root beer.
I found medication under your pillow.
I'm not supposed to. It's dangerous.
who said that? Come on, little man.
hurry up.
halt, please!
then I am in the monkey house at Philadelphia Zoological Park.
three thousand people show up my first day.
look.
what's it like living in a cage? -It stinks.
but the monkeys, they do some tricks there.
I throw a spear...
wrestle with Kowali, she is orangutan.
when I'm not playing with the monkeys, they want me to run to the bars in my cage, with my teeth.
so then what did you do? -Then I leave ZOO.
go here, go there, wander most of the time.
you were all alone? -Plenty of time you'd be alone.
when you're different like us, it's gonna be that way.
but I tell you a little secret. Fat people, skinny people, tall people, white people... they're just as alone as we are.
but they are scared shitless.
I think about the river I grew up on.
it would be nice to sit by my river again.
come. I have an appointment.
there's my little man. You ready, sugar?
always ready. Always ready.
Filamena, mr Benjamin.
it's a pleasure to meet you, sir. -My pleasure, ma'am.
you can find your own way home, can't you?
take the St. Charles line to Napoleon.
where in God's name have you been? Get in here!
youre goin' to take my breath away, you know that?
Oh Lord, I was so worried about you.
it had been the best day of my life.
how's her breathing? -Shallow.
they're sayin' it will reach us in few hours.
I gotta get my baby and take him to my sister's.
they say there's nothin' to worry about here in the hospital.
nurses will be right here if you need them. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay, reading...
I shouldn't be more than an hour.
was there just company?
it was just Dorothy leaving.
go on, Caroline.
on sundays, the families would come and visit.
it was Thanksgiving, 1930.
I met the person who changed my life forever.
well, Benjamin...
might I say you are looking strikingly youthful.
good day, Mrs Fuller.
a single cane, back straight as an arrow...
what elixir have you been drinking?
thank you, Ma'am. -Grandma, look at me!
that was really something! Come on over here, you.
this is my granddaughter Daisy. This is mister...
I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't rightly know your last name.
benjamin is fine.
I never forgot her blue eyes.
good people, supper is served.
did you know turkeys aren't really birds?
why do you say that? -They're in the pheasant family.
they can hardly fly. Sad, don't you think? Birds that can't fly.
I like birds that can't fly. They are so delicious.
that's cruel. -I have something to tell you all.
while we're giving thanks for God's blessings...
I've had a miracle happen.
the Lord saw fit to answer my prayers.
what does she mean "answers her prayers"?
she's gonna have a baby, silly.
that's what my momma said when I was gonna have a baby brother.
but he didn't live long.
cause he didn't breathe right.
...when he got his beautiful hind legs just as big God Ngog had promised.
you can see that it's five o'clock, because big God Ngog's clock says so.
isn't that something?
again. Read it again. -Read it again, please.
alright. But afterwards, you must go to bed.
I promise.
old Man Kangaroo...
are you sleeping?
who is that? -It's me, Daisy.
Hi! -Come out!
where are we going? -Come on. Right in here.
here, you light it. -I'm not supposed to play with matches.
don't be a chicken. Light it!
I'll tell you a secret if you'll tell me one. -Okay.
I saw my momma kissing another man.
her face was red from it.
your turn.
I'm not as old as I look.- I thought so.
you don't...you don't seem like an old person. Like my grandma.
I'm not. -Are you sick?
well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper and they said I was gonna die soon, but...
maybe not.
you're odd.
you're different than anybody I've ever met.
may I? -Okay.
what are you doing under there?
you come right out here and get back up to bed.
it's after midnight!
you are not to be playing together. -Yes, ma'am.
now you get back to your bed, little lady.
you're too young to be wandering around at night on your own.
and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
you are a different child. A man child and...
baby, people are gonna to understand just how different you are.
why chose me, mama?
come here.
God is busy...
go to bed here, and behave yourself.
go. Sleep pretty.
did I ever tell you I have been struck by lightning for seven times?
once when I was repairing a leak on the roof.
once I just crossed the road to get the mail.
I'll never forgot the home of...us.
mom, did you get that this Benjamin loved you when the first time that he saw you?
not many people experience that.
I'd make it go on.
it's going to the next page.
when that baby came, things were different.
babies were born. People die.
a lof of folks have been doing that or else.
I've come to say goodbye. I'm going away.
going? Where?
I haven't figured that out there, but I will send you a postcard when I get there.
what about your friend? -The tall lady?
we're not friends anymore.
that's what happens with tall people sometimes.
well... goodbye.
I spent a lot of time by myself that year.
Hello?
Hi. -I'm moving in today.
welcome. We've been expecting you.
can you please show her up to Mrs Rousseau's old room?
I'm sorry, but we usually don't allow dogs in the house.
well, she's old as the hills, she's almost blind.
she won't be a bother much longer.
well, alright, as long as she stays out from underfoot.
all right, this way, Ma'am.
as hard as I try, I can't remember her name.
Mrs Lawson, or Mrs Hartford, or maybe it was Maple?
it's funny how sometimes the people we remember the least make the greatest impression on us.
I do remember she wore diamonds.
and she always dressed in fine clothing as if she's going out.
although she never did and nobody ever came to visit her.
she taught me to play the piano.
it's not about how well you play, it's how you feel about what you're playing.
try this.
you cannot help but put yourself into the music.
there were many changes. Some you could see, some your couldn't.
hair started growing in all sorts of places.
along with other things.
I felt pretty good, considering.
Oh, darlin', the pain. -Alright mom, I'll get the nurse.
look at this eye.
this is a major hurricane. -WeatherPlus Katrina
not doing too good?
nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave.
I'm gonna ride it out.
there, that should make things much easier.
have you had a chance to say your goodbyes?
my father waited 4 hours for my brother to get here from Boger City.
couldn't go without him.
she seems like a sweet woman. -Yeah.
I haven't had as much time with her... -Are you busy?
excuse me. -Sure.
Queenie would let me go with Mr Daws to Poverty Point, to watch the boats go up and down the river.
these were hard times.
did I ever tell you I was struck by lightning seven times?
once when I was in the field just tending to my cows.
my fourt' hand didn't show up.
anybody wanna make 2 dollar for a day's work around here?
what's the matter?
nobody wants to do an honest day's work for an honest day's pay?
he never pays.
nobody wants the job? -I do.
you got your sea legs, old man?
I think.
that's good enough for me.
get your ass on board, we'll sure as hell find out!
chelsea NEW ORLEANS LA
I was as happy as I could be. -I need a volunteer!
I would do anything. -Yes, captain!
scrape off all this bird shit. -Right away, sir.
I was actually goin' to be paid for something I would've done for free.
his name was captain Mike Clark.
he'd been on a tugboat since he was seven.
get movin'!
come here.
could you... still get it up?
I...do every morning.
the old pole? The hard'n?
I guess.
when was the last time you had a woman?
never. -Never?
not that I know of, sir.
wait a minute!
you mean to say, you've been on this earth for how many years, and you never had a woman?
Damn! That's the saddest thing I ever heard in my life.
never? -No.
then, by Jesus, you are comin' with me.
what did your father do? -I never met my father.
you lucky bastard!
all father's gonna do is hold you down.
out on my father's boat, working da two-a-days.
this little fat bastard, "tug Irish" they call him.
I finally get up the nerves and tell him:
I don't wanna spend da rest of my life on a goddamn tugboat!
you know what I'm sayin'?
you don't wanna spend the rest of your life on a tugboat.
absolutely, damn right!
and you know what my father says to me?
he says: "Who the hell do you think you are?
what the hell do you think you can do?
I tell him:
well, if you're askin'...
I'm ganna be an artist.
he laughs... "An artist?
God meant for you to work a tugboat just like me.
and that's exactly what you're gonna do.
well, I turned myself into an artist.
a tattoo artist!
I put on every one of these myself.
you have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now!
when I'm dead, I'm gonna send him my arm.
that one.
don't let anyone tell you different!
you gotta do what you're meant to do.
and I happen to be a god-damned artist!
but you're a tugboat captain.
captain Mike, we're ready for you and your friend.
go, old timer. Break your cherry.
Hello, ladies!
Hi.
he gives me the willies. That is not for me.
how are you tonight, grandpa?
it was a night to remember.
what are you, Dick Tracy or something? I've got to rest.
I can't.
thank you. -No, thank you. Have a nice night.
will you be here tomorrow? -Every night but sunday.
it sure made me understand the value of earning a living.
things money can buy you.
it's nasty out. Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
that's awfully kind of you, sir.
my name is Thomas. Thomas Button.- I'm Benjamin.
Benjamin... it's a pleasure to know you.
would you like to stop somewhere and have a drink?
all right.
good evening.
what will it be, sir? -I'll have whatever he's having.
a Sazerac for both of us. With whiskey, not brandy.
you don't drink, do you? -It's a night for firsts.
how's that?-I've never been to a brothel, either.
it's an experience. -Certainly is.
there's a first time for everything. -Sure enough.
your drinks.
I don't mean to be rude...but your hands, is that painful?
I was born with some form of disease. -What kind of disease?
I was born old.
I'm sorry. -No need to be. Nothing wrong with old age.
my wife passed away many years ago.
I'm so so sorry.
she died in childbirth.
to children. -To mothers.
what line of work are you in, Mr Button? -Buttons.
button's Buttons. There isn't a button we don't make.
our biggest competition is B. F. Goodrich and his infernal zippers.
would you gentlemen like anything else?
one for the road, Benjamin?
only if you let me pay for it, Mr Button.
so, what line of work do you do?
I'm a tugboat man.
I enjoyed talking to you. -I enjoyed drinking with you.
Benjamin...
would you mind if, time to time, I stop by and say hello?
anytime. Good night, Mr Button.
good night, Benjamin. Drive off.
where have you been?
nothing. I met some people and listened to music...
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!
growing up is a funny thing. Sneaks up on you.
one person is there and then suddenly somebody else is taking their place.
she wasn't all elbows and knees anymore.
Benjamin! Come on. -Okay.
I loved those weekends when she'd come and spend the night with her grandmother.
Daisy! Daisy!
you wanna see something?
you gotta keep it a secret.
get dressed. I'll meet you out back.
come on!
can you swim? -I can do anything you can do.
put this on. We gotta hurry.
chelsea
is he okay? -Captain!
captain Mike!
morning, captain. Can you take us out?
do you know what day it is? -Sunday.
you know what that means?
it means that I was very drunk last night.
you're drunk every night.
is that a girl? -A close friend. I want to show her the river.
I'm not supposed to go joy-ridin' with civilians.
I could lose my licence.
what are you waiting for?
she put in for repair. A wounded duck.
she's flyin' now!
I wish we could go with them.
did you say something, mom?
it's getting really bad.
can you hear me, mom?
time just seeped out of me.
things were changing quickly.
I don't know how it's possible, but you seem to have more hair.
what if I told you that I wasn't getting older, but I was getting younger than everybody else.
well, I'd feel sorry for you.
to have to see everybody you love die before you do.
it's an awful responsibility.
I've never thought about life or death that way before.
Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love.
how else would we know how important they are to us.
and one fall day, a familiar visitor came knocking on our door.
you wanna go with me to the drugstore?
she taught me how to play the piano. -Amen!
and she taught me what it meant to miss somebody.
let's go.
I had gone to a brothel, I had my first drink,
said goodbye to one friend and burried another.
in 1936, when I was coming to the end of the 17th year of my life,
I packed my bag and said goodbye.
I knew, life being what it was,
I'd probably never see them again.
good luck to you, son. -Thanks.
I love you, mom.- I love you too, baby.
I want you to say your prayers every night, hear?
be safe!
Benjamin!
where are you going? -Off to sea.
I'll send you a postcard.
from everywhere.
write me a postcard from everywhere.
can you imagine?
he sent me a postcard from everywhere he went.
every place he worked.
newfoundland, Baffin Bay, Glasgow, Liverpool, Narvik...
he had gone with that captain Mike.
captain Mike had contracted for three years with Moran Brothers
tug and Salvage. The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine and a new sea winch.
we went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard.
we were a crew of seven now. Captain Mike and me, the cookie, Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware.
the Brody twins, Rick and Vic who got along fine at sea, but for some reason, once they were on dry land, couldn't stand the sight of each other. You know?
one in every eight boats never returns...
there was John Grimm, who sure fit his name.
...all hands lost at sea.
from Belvedere, South Dakota.
and Pleasant Curtis from Nashville, who never said a word to anyone, except himself.
I wrote him constantly.
I told him I had been invited to audition in New York City, for the School of American Ballet.
please stay. Thank you. Thank you.
you can stay.
I was relegated to the "corps." Another dancing gypsy.
Benjamin, how is it when you showed up, you were no bigger than a bollard with one foot in the grave.
now... either I drink a helluva lot more than I think I do, or you sprouted! What's your secret?
well, Captain...
you do drink a lot.
we stayed in a small hotel with the grand name, "The Winter Palace.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
the hummingbird is not just another bird.
its heart rate is 1, 200 beats a minute.
its wings beat 80 times a second.
if you was to stop their wings from beatin, they would be dead in less that ten seconds.
this is no ordinary bird, this is a frikkin' miracle!
they slowed down their wings with moving pictures, and you know what they saw? Their wingtips are doing...
you know what the figure "8" is the mathematical symbol for?
infinity!
everybody, no matter what differences they had, languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common:
they were drunk every single night.
could you hold the lift, please? -Thank you very much.
her name was Elizabeth Abbott.
she was not beautiful. She was plain as paper.
but she was pretty as any picture to me.
what are you looking at?
if you must know, we have a long standing agreement never to go to bed sober. Isn't that right, honey?
whatever you say, darling. -Her husband was Walter Abbott.
he was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk.
and he was a spy.
are you okay, darling? -Oh yes.
I broke my heel off one of my shoes.
I'm not in a habit of walking about in my stocking feet.
they were long days there.
and even longer nights.
one particular night, I was having trouble sleeping.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't sleep.
I was gonna make some tea. Would you like some?
no, thank you.
milk? Honey? -A bit of honey, please.
I hope you like flies in your honey. -Oh, perhaps not.
maybe... better to let it steep a little.
steep? -Soak.
I don't know, I mean... there's a proper way of making tea.
where I'm from, people just want it to be hot.
well, quite right.
are you a seaman?-Sailor.
I hope I'm not being impolite, but I have to ask:
aren't you a little old to be working on a boat?
there's no age limit, as long as you can do the work.
and you have trouble sleeping? Thank you.
I didn't think I did. I usually sleep like a baby.
something kept me up.
my father, in his eighties, he was so convinced he's gonna die in his sleep, he limited himself to having afternoon naps.
he was so determined that he was gonna cheat death.
did he? -Did he what?
die in his sleep?
he died sitting in his favorite chair, listening to his favorite program on the wireless.
he must have known something.
my husband is British Trade Minister, and we've been here for fourteen months.
good God! -We were supposed to go to Peking.
but it never seemed to work out.
have you been in the Far East?
no. I've never been anywhere, really. I mean outside harbors.
and where is it that you're from? - New Orleans, Louisiana.
I didn't know there was another.
and she told me about all the places she had been.
what she had seen.
and we talked till just before the dawn.
and we went back to our rooms, to our separate lives.
but every night, we'd meet again in that lobby.
a hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place.
a mouse running and stopping.
a radiator hissing. A curtain blowing.
there's something peaceful, even comforting, knowing that people you love are asleep in their beds, where nothing can harm them.
Elizabeth and I would lose track of the night, till just before daybreak.
I think I may have given you the wrong impression.
I beg your pardon?
well, married women don't customarily sit around in the middle of the night with strange men in hotels.
I wouldn't know what a married woman does and doesn't do.
good night!
Murmansk.
I've met somebody and I've fallen in love." Mom?
that was over 60 years ago.
did you love him, mother? -What does a girl know about love?
I am working in the Russian Fort of Murmansk. It's very cold here.
I'm not dressed. - You look splendid just as you are.
don't waste any time bothering about the wine or the cheese in Murmansk, cause they are really completely ordinary.
but the caviar and the vodka are sublime and plentiful.
so...
savor it... and don't eat it all at once.
because that way, there's nothing left to enjoy.
now take a little swallow of vodka while it's still in your mouth.
Nazdrovia.
you haven't been with many women, have you?
not on sundays.
and you've never had a girlfriend before, have you? No ma'am.
when I was nineteen, I attempted to become the first woman ever to swim the English Channel.
Really?
but the current that day was so strong that...
for every stroke I took, I was pushed back two.
I was in the water for 32 hours.
and when I was two miles from Calais, it started to rain.
when I couldn't go any further,
I stopped.
I just stopped.
and everybody asked me would I try again.
why wouldn't I?
I never did. As a matter of fact,
I've never done anything with my life after that.
your hands are so coarse.
I can feel the wind in your cheeks.
I'm afraid it's the witching hour.
it was the first time a woman had ever kissed me.
it's something you never forget.
Benjamin! -You make me feel younger.
you make me feel years younger too. I wish I was.
so many things I'd change. I'd undo all my mistakes.
what mistakes?
I kept waiting, you know.
thinking that I'd do something to change my circumstances.
do something.
such an awful waste, you never get it back.
wasted time.
if we're going to have an affair, you're never to look at me during the day.
and we're always to part before sunrise, and we will never say "I love you."
those are the rules.
are you cold?- I'm freezing.
she was the first woman that ever loved me.
want me to skip some?
no, glad he had somebody to keep him warm.
I couldn't wait to see her again.
we saw each other every night. We always used the same room.
but each time seemed new and different.
come here.
Elizabeth...
good night.
until one night.
yesterday, December 7th 1941, the day which will live in infamy.
...possibly in the near future, and possibly beyond.
there's been a change of plan, lads.
as you may or may not know, the Japs bombed Pearl Harbor yesterday.
Frank D. Roosevelt asked each of us to do our part.
the Chelsea's been commissioned to serve in the United States Navy.
to repair, salvage and to rescue.
anybody doesn't wanna go to war, now it's the time to say so.
once you set foot on that boat, you're in the Navy, friend.
I've been meaning to talk with you, Mike.
my wife's doing poorly.
I'd like to maybe see her one more time.
so here's your truth, Mr. Thompson.
as sick as Hugh was, I begged him not to make the call.
I begged him every night for nine months.
and then before Christmas I asked him what he wanted for a gift...
...the last gift I'd ever give him...
...and he said, "There's only one thing you can get me, sweetheart."
it's an appointment with Dr. Kevorkian.
I find no factual basis to proceed.
exonerated once again. Jack: 15, Thompson: Zilch.
wow, no wonder everyone's drinking at this show.
is that Santa Claus stepping on a baby? - Yes.
tell me about doc's Christmases.
looks quite morbid. Well, except for the flower that is.
thank God, I'm not his shrink.
our grandparents, our aunts, our uncles...
the Armenian Holocaust, it was the same as the Jews.
only our parents, barely teenagers, were able to flee.
growing up, all we heard were those terrible stories of all the bloodshed...
...and it frightened Jack so.
it's all dealing with the melancholy age-old struggle...
...between the warmth of life, the iciness of death.
only, I'm sure that thing would be better served had a real artist done it.
many nights he would just sit in his bed, lights on a must...
...you know, clutching that little dog of ours so tight...
wait a minute. Wait a minute. He had a dog?
you're looking so intently. - Yes.
what are you feeling? That's what I'd like to know.
it's... - It's?
would you like a glass of wine? - Hi.
I know what you're feeling. You're feeling it's macabre.
it is macabre, my friend. - Yes, but you're looking at it nonetheless.
it's like war. War, you're drawn to it, but after you've been through it you say:
"Oh, that was grotesque, macabre, strange, ugly."
that's the feeling I'm trying to convey. - I'm sold.
I heard "sold."
how much, Jack? - Whatever you think is fair.
my patients thank you in advance. - Good.
this is from my private collection.
Hello? - Dr. Kevorkian...
... l'm afraid we have some bad news regarding your sister.
it appears she had the heart attack a couple of hours before she called 911.
perhaps she thought that whatever it was, it would just pass.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss.
wouldn't you like to see her?
by late much too often deceived by too early a death now relieved of the burdens she bore My sis Margo gave more to my life than she ever received
the whole question of death and dying involves the most profound...
... and complex ethical questions that we must decide as a society.
at no time have the people of Michigan or the Michigan Legislature...
... granted Jack Kevorkian, or any other individual...
... the sole right to decide who lives or dies in our state.
thank you, governor. Congratulations.
over here. Just swing it right over here. - We're gonna save some of that stuff.
come on.
we all support you, Jack. - Oh, thank you, fellas. Thank you.
could I? - Oh, yeah.
Jimmy, give me a hand here. - Come on.
I'm signing an autograph, okay? Wait a minute.
I got it in a settlement a couple years ago.
beats the hell out of your apartment.
a lake.
geese? - Yeah.
well, it is a bit romantic for my taste.
Oh, well, sue me for trying to put a goddamn roof over your head, Jack.
well... - I'm not letting you live in some YMCA.
come on. - Fine.
only I have taken this yet.
and if I do, I'm paying the rent.
I'm no charity case.
okay, I'll take it.
okay. Geoff? Let's go. - Yeah?
let's go. Don't you have work to get back to?
like what?
like what?
like appealing the 15-month ban that's tying my hands.
what's on your mind, Jack?
they made a law, specifically to stop me. I wanna challenge it.
I wanna test it.
what is this?
thomas Hyde, 30 years old.
Lou Gehrig's disease.
you gonna go along with me on this?
I'm with you, Jack.
okay, don't strain too much. Don't strain, don't strain.
he's gonna get a cramp here, does he? Yes.
all right, that's enough of the physical stuff, Tom.
no more physical. I just wanted you to move a little for the record.
so now, Tom, tell me, what is it you wish?
in plain English.
bond is set for $50, 000. You gonna pay that today?
that is beyond egregious. - There is no way I'm going to pay...
...a bond like that, Your Honor, you can forget it.
you can forget it because this is the last time...
Jack.
you people unjustly take away from me my liberties.
I need a moment with my client. - And I will not... Hear me now.
I will not eat. Guaranteed. - Jack.
I apologize for my client. - You are assisting in my suicide.
please, Jack, Jack, Jack. Listen. Come on.
Jack, this is better than I could have imagined.
every paper's treating you as a victim.
don't even think about paying my bond. Let them convict me.
you're not getting convicted on my watch. Here, Jack. Come on.
have a Bazooka.
bazooka?
no, it is not cheating. It's just a little apple juice.
I put some vitamin drops in, that's all. Go ahead.
vitamin drops? - There you go.
I've seen you before, haven't I? What the hell is in here?
you've seen better days. Just drink it down.
I sure have.
that's it.
that's sweet of you, Janet. - My pleasure, doc.
share some with me. - No, no, no, you have it.
I'm on the wagon.
because it...
because it...
what is it?
I know this. I know this so well.
why can't I? "Because it is my name.
because it is...
my soul.
because this..." How could I not know that?
because it is my name.
because I cannot...
because I cannot have another in my life.
because I cannot have another in my life. Because it is my name.
I have given you my life. I have given you my life.
because I would... Because I would..." No, no, no.
because I cannot have... Because I cannot have a...
let me not... Because l...
so what? So I don't know it.
I cannot...
cannot have any love in my life. Is this maybe?
because... Because...
how may I live without my name?
...given you my soul.
Margo.
Margo.
you were right.
it's nicer.
it is nicer.
I can... I can...
because it... Because it...
because it is me. Because it is me.
because it is me.
it's been 19 days.
I'm granting Mr. Fieger's request to reduce your bond to 100 bucks.
thank you, Your Honor.
if you wanna fire me, go ahead.
so is there anything else you wish to add, Tom, or have Heidi tell us?
or, Heidi, is there anything you would add before we conclude this discussion?
I'm sorry, honey.
that's all I wanted to say.
it's too much for us.
Tom, I love you.
jail Jack! Jail Jack! Jail Jack!
I remind Kevorkian this not-guilty verdict...
... does not change the fact that we still have a ban in effect.
I think mankind took a historic step today out of the Dark Ages.
it makes me think of the Nuremberg trials...
... when a law is deemed immoral by you, you must disobey it.
you must disobey it.
thank you. - Dick.
the man's invincible. Hell, so am I.
just got word that the Court of Appeals is gonna hear arguments on your ban.
hell, I'm gonna win that too.
why can't we have clinics doing this stuff?
every city should have a clinic where someone can go.
I just got an idea. I'm gonna have one of my own.
how does it feel to be victorious?
victorious? I never feel victorious. I just go ahead and do what I do.
this isn't a victory to me. It's just common sense.
you don't need hardly nothing. The walls are good.
no, you can't leave it white. - What's wrong with white?
you want something that's cream, or robin's-egg blue.
something that's warm. Something that's peaceful.
should be higher, you think?
I don't have any window nails on me right now.
well, you know, Neal, it's not like it's 500 pounds, you know?
just lift it up. There it is. That looks good.
it's not center enough, but who cares, right?
there you go. - It's perfect.
Yep.
I couldn't tell because I gotta go outside and see it here.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
if you're unconscious, they have the right to turn off the feeding tube and let you die.
but if you're conscious and rational...
...and begging for assistance to be allowed to die...
...we refuse. We refuse.
now, how is it possible that a mentally-competent adult not have the right to look a doctor in the eye and say, "I've had enough."
I can't endure any more pain.
help me, I've had enough"?
do we really want government making those decisions for us?
no.
it can't be.
it just can't be.
in a rented storefront in Warren...
... Kevorkian aided the death of a Kansas City, Missouri woman...
forget it.
are you trying to say you didn't know who I was?
you didn't really think this was gonna be a bakery, did you?
you got 24 hours to vacate. Not a minute more.
if we can get into another storage unit... Not storage unit, but another place.
we've got a place to move all the crap so we don't have to...
well, you gotta store it or they're gonna throw it out on the street.
shoot.
ray, boy. - They shut us down, Ray.
they just shut us down.
you know, same kind of thing spurred the '67 riots, you know?
you remember? Of course, you remember, you were there.
you were a captain, weren't you?
what's the matter?
Hey, Jan. - Janny?
what's going on?
I've got the cancer. Pancreatic.
they diagnosed me this morning.
giving me six months. But I'm not rolling over like that.
here, make yourself useful. Put that in the oven.
here.
what do you got?
pecan sandies here or? - No, it's chocolate chip.
here, here's another one. - Yeah.
so, what's new with you?
they shut us down.
so we're gonna have to...
...you know, find another place.
we will. We'll find another place.
don't worry.
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Geoff.
they don't wanna eat today.
I'm sorry to hear about Janet.
here.
the Court of Appeals ruling just came in and they ruled in our favor.
they said that the law was so poorly worded that it could not be upheld.
well, I'm glad to hear there's still some smart people in power left.
well, that was the good news.
they also ruled that there's no constitutional right to commit suicide.
I take back what I just said.
and that aiding in one falls under an old common-law definition of murder.
common law? What the hell is that?
we're gonna retry him on Sherry Miller and Marjorie Wantz.
those two weren't terminal and it's my job to see they get justice.
are you really certain that...? - I got him in my crosshairs now.
the public doesn't want another trial.
from all I hear, they're ready to turn the page.
I stopped worrying about public perception a long time ago, David.
public crusader or attention-grabbing egotist?
you be the judge as Dr. Jack Kevorkian...
... appears at the courthouse locked in an old-fashioned wooden pillory.
prosecutor Dick Thompson can only hope...
... his roll of the dice finally muzzles the maverick physician.
top defense lawyer Mayer Morganroth has his money on Jack.
this is a clear manifestation of the existence of the Inquisition in this state.
medieval punishment for a medieval concept.
this is not a trial. - Your Honor, please.
what law have I broken?
tell me, what law have I broken? Some antiquated common laws.
common law. You know that it's a crime...
your Honor. - Just a moment.
to convert from Christianity to Islam? Did you know that was a common law?
it's a crime not to believe in the Bible. That's a common law.
this is not a trial. - Your Honor.
this is not a trial, it's a lynching.
and I'm not gonna participate in my own lynching.
can we presume, just for the hell of it, that we are really in a courtroom?
no, I will not presume. I refuse to presume.
can we presume this is a real trial?
no, we can't, because there's no law here.
am I wrong? - You're wrong!
prove it. Cite to me one common-law case of assisted suicide.
one. Go ahead. - I will ask the questions, sir.
we're all waiting. Cite one, smart-ass. - Are you gonna answer my question?
go ahead and do it. - Your Honor.
Dr. Kevorkian, I'm warning you.
your Honor, you may cite me for contempt, but I'm finished with this farce.
I'm not gonna be a part of it. I just can't. I'm so sick and tired of this fusion of religious dogma and medicine. - - Resume the stand, Dr.Kevorkian.
can I ask for a recess, please? Just a couple of minutes.
recess. - Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you.
there's nothing anybody could do for me and everybody knows that...
time to give it up, Dick.
or I would not be here.
Jack. Jack, I told you those videotapes were gonna be our golden ticket.
but we have to take this to the Supreme Court, Geoff.
we have to do it.
we still gotta get a law legalizing assisted suicide, no?
Congratulations. Hey, Jack. Come on, you won.
enjoy yourself. - Morganroth is right, Jack.
you'll never see another courtroom again. The house of cards is falling...
...and Engler's going down with it.
ladies and gentlemen!
come on. - Please, please...
...I have an important announcement.
I've decided to run for governor. - Here, here!
Fieger for governor!
Fieger's your fire!
next stop, Lansing!
david Gorcyca, Oakland County prosecutor.
has a nice ring to it.
you know, you owe me after the way I demolished Thompson for you.
I know you'll stay out of Jack's hair.
thompson blew way too many taxpayer dollars on these prosecutions.
I've no intention to waste one more nickel. As long as Kevorkian stays in line...
...he can assist as many patients as he damn well pleases.
no worries. Jack's learned to listen to everything I say.
you know, I'm only operating by the grace of this prosecutor.
go ahead, you can go do your thing in some dark little corner of the universe...
...but do it quietly," you know?
the lingering of death, what a business.
keep death alive. Hospitals don't make money otherwise.
drug companies either.
if you're rich and you have the money, you can pay to die.
but the poor, they can only afford to stick it out and suffer.
they say complacency is a virtue... - Oh, stop whining.
you make me more nauseous than my chemo.
you have full reign, huh, just deal with it.
Yeah.
I think the biggest mistake of my life was not getting married.
excuse me?
I could've, you know.
procreated.
kept the family name alive. Why not?
procreate? You would've made that big a sacrifice to keep the family name alive? You would've done that?
well, sometimes, you know, you gotta get your hands a little dirty.
well, could you have loved though, doc?
that's the bigger question. Could you, have loved?
you didn't put sugar in here again.
don't get up.
we need to have a conversation.
you know I'm not lugging this thing around just because it's sexy.
and you're the only doctor in my neighborhood that practices euthanasia.
Oh, we're not there yet.
you got plenty of time.
Fieger! Fieger! Fieger!
okay, okay. Let's keep these signs up.
let's keep them up there. Oh, don't drop that.
did you get a T-shirt? Get those buttons out there.
buttons, buttons.
what is your official stance on the assisted-suicide issue?
I give my word to the people of Michigan that I will not be supporting doctor-assisted suicide.
even with your history with Dr. Kevorkian?
what I've always said is I support an individual's right to choose.
but I repeat, I will not be supporting doctor-assisted suicide.
there you have it, folks.
now back to you, John. This is Megan, from Channel 4 News.
there's something happening here, people...
... and if you don't know what it is, it's Geoffrey Fieger.
the 47-year-old Fieger's flair for the dramatic has enlivened a campaign that most analysts said would be dishwater dull.
no longer advocating for Kevorkian, Fieger is now advocating for himself...
... and campaigning with Michigan voters. Billing himself as the "anti-politician.
governor Engler is dumber than Dan Quayle and twice as ugly.
he's a racist and he's a liar.
it's the acerbic tongue of Geoffrey Fieger's...
... that Republicans say they'll make the major issue of this upcoming race.
God had his chance to come take me. I'll go to him instead.
you gonna look at me, doc?
or is it an Armenian thing?
is what? - You know, keeping it all in inside...
...just keep it going. Is that an Armenian thing?
Oh, I don't know. - How could it be an Armenian thing?
Margo was just as Armenian as you are and she'd talk my ear off.
she told me everything. She could share.
you don't share.
what do you want me to share?
anything. Everything.
I'm afraid... - I know, I know.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
I'm not afraid for myself, you dope. I'm afraid for you.
all right? Your little band of Kevorkians is shrinking into nothing.
will you come closer? I can't see you out there.
here.
right here. - Yes. Okay.
see, Margo and I were the only two that could tell you to shut up.
look, you need more people in your corner, not less.
people that you can trust.
and the only way people trust each other is if they know each other.
and nobody knows you.
nobody.
how did it feel when your mother was dying?
you were a doctor, a healer...
...and you were helpless. How did that feel?
you know, I failed her. I failed my mother.
And?
she once said to me:
imagine, Jack, the worst toothache in the world.
now, imagine that toothache being in every bone in your body.
that's...
that's what was happening to her.
she was my mother. I devoted my life to her.
so...
so how'd you feel?
I remember...
I remember being in this little hospital room, this chilly little room...
...lone window in the red brick wall...
...that's what it faced...
...and all these doctors circling around my mother...
...trying to keep her alive.
and I was helpless.
I was powerless, helpless and ineffectual.
and I felt...
...lost.
I was lost.
that's how I felt.
Thanks, doc.
Thanks.
ray and the kids... - Yeah.
give my love to Margo.
Yes.
Hey, you guys.
okay.
your little band of Kevorkians is shrinking into nothing.
Jack. - Dr. Kevorkian. Dr. Kevorkian.
Dr. Kevorkian, over here.
over here. Come on, give us a smile, Dr. Kevorkian.
I'm afraid for you. You're not the best spokesperson for the cause, really.
I don't have forever. - Jack. Jack.
your little band of Kevorkians is shrinking into nothing. Disappearing.
give us a smile. - Dr. Kevorkian, just one question.
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was among the Who's Who on hand to celebrate TIME magazine's 75th Anniversary Gala at Radio City Music Hall.
the big night was attended by many of the faces who've appeared on TIME's covers over the decade.
you need more people in your corner. I'm afraid for you.
from Joe DiMaggio to Jerry Falwell, to Raquel Welch to Henry Kissinger.
I'm afraid for you.
your little band of Kevorkians is shrinking into nothing.
I don't have forever.
we have to take this to the Supreme Court, Geoff.
Jack, I'm dealing with the religious right. - My condolences.
and the disability group, they think you wanna kill the whole lot of them.
so? What have we accomplished? No law's been passed.
I mean, this is the prelude. This is the beginning.
the Battle of Concord, the Battle of Lexington...
what are you thinking? - I'm thinking of the Supreme Court.
I'm thinking of going all the way.
if they wanna silence me, let them prosecute me.
convict me. Send me to jail. Like Martin Luther King or Galileo...
the Supreme Court has already said that the states do have the right to outlaw doctor-assisted suicide!
you don't listen! They also said that they would hear a case if the right one came along.
if it was for a particularly suffering individual, they would hear it.
you don't listen.
okay, Tom, so have you discussed your wishes with your wife and family?
do they want you to go on?
Yes.
they understand why.
it's my decision.
he's saying, "It's my decision.
okay.
now, Tom, I will be administering direct lethal injection.
what's called "active euthanasia.
you don't wanna wait a month or so?
no, I do not.
how about two weeks? Two weeks?
no.
a week? Can you wait a week?
Yeah. - Okay.
okay, we'll stretch it out another week.
doing the deed yourself?
this is really crossing into uncharted territory.
so I set sail.
rudderless, I admit...
...but that's the way it goes.
this is gonna allow me to do direct lethal injection.
I'm alone, Neal.
and I'm running out of time.
that first day, 35 years ago...
...you came down to the basement lab and talked to all us med techs...
...you were the only doctor in our whole hospital...
...we didn't think was a pompous son of a bitch.
well, that was your first mistake.
Yeah, I let you stick needles in me, transfuse cadaver blood.
shit, you weren't the only one that got hepatitis, Jack.
hell, we had some good times.
you had purpose, Jack.
you had purpose, and I guess I needed some too.
and I know this is your decision...
...but if you decide to pull the plug on somebody yourself...
...you're gonna be flying solo.
yes?
this is Melody Youk. I'm sorry to call so late, but it's Tom.
he can't wait any longer. He's terrified.
Oh, okay. Okay. I'm on my way.
just say your goodbyes then, Melody...
...because I don't want anyone to be there when I do this thing.
I'm on my way.
Jack. - Hey, Jack.
look what I got.
I want a national debate on this.
because once that happens, they have to charge me.
they have no choice, right? - With murder, maybe.
I wanna put euthanasia on trial.
let the people decide if it's murder. - You're gonna sacrifice yourself.
you could go to prison for the rest of your life.
you know, I know Barbara Walters. She likes me.
but I want a bigger audience.
you know Mike Wallace, don't you?
no, I under... Yeah.
I mean, it...
if you put him on the air, will you be dealing with a rational human being?
well, I can't promise rational with Kevorkian, Mike.
but if you're asking if he's sane, I'd say yes.
he knows exactly what he's doing.
Dr. Jack Kevorkian who has acknowledged helping more than 130 patients kill themselves...
... tonight reveals that two months ago he killed one of his patients himself...
... and recorded it on videotape.
Tom Youk led an active life. He restored and raced vintage cars.
but two years ago at age 50, he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease...
... a devastating incurable illness that destroyed his muscles.
he lost the use of his legs and then his arms.
his family says he was in terrible pain, had trouble breathing and swallowing...
... and was choking on his own saliva.
and we're ready to inject. We're gonna inject your right arm, okay?
first, the doctor gave him Seconol to put him to sleep quickly.
sleepy, Tom?
Tom, are you asleep?
you asleep? He's asleep.
then he injected a muscle relaxant to stop his breathing.
and this? - Paralyzes the muscles.
but he's still alive at...? - Well, he's still alive, but that's why...
now you see? Now his lack of oxygen is getting to him now.
but he's unconscious, deeply, so it doesn't matter.
is he dead now? - He's dying now.
because his oxygen's cut off, he can't breathe.
so I'll now quickly inject the potassium chloride to stop the heart.
now there's a straight line.
he's dead. - Yep. The heart has stopped.
I'm shocked that it's come to this, that in the 90's...
... we have to make such an issue out of something...
... a person should be in control of. Their own life and death.
and those who say that Jack Kevorkian, Dr. Death, is a fanatic?
zealot.
I'm fighting for me, Mike. For me. Because this is a right I want.
I might wind up being terribly suffering.
I'd like to know there's a colleague out there who would come to me in my time of need.
now, that might sound selfish, and maybe it is...
... but if it helps everybody else, then so be it.
this whole thing's making me sick to my stomach.
well, he admits on national TV that he's a killer.
Fifty-million homes heard him say "fuck you" to us.
I want that whole interview, and I want him convicted.
let's make it happen, John. He's gone too far.
I'm gonna represent myself.
what, are you're firing me?
finally, I get to say what I wanna say.
no lawyer, not even you, can address a jury the way I can.
migrate, will you?
Jack, you don't know shit about law. Okay? They'll hurt you.
no, I'm gonna hurt them.
because if I lose, I hurt them, if I win, I hurt them.
you're lucky you're in Michigan, if you were in some other state, they'd fry your ass.
here they'll just toss you in a cell and throw away the key.
this is not a game. - No, it's a game.
it's a game that if I lose, I win because I go to the Supreme Court.
I get this debate in front of the people where it belongs.
that's an assumption.
what if you're wrong? Are you willing to set back the legalization of assisted suicide...
never been wrong. Not gonna start now. ...for God knows how long?!
migrate. - Jack, would you forget the geese?
Migrate! Look, you're hiding behind the boat.
you know, I never minded feeding them, but look at this.
all over. It's poop. Watch where you're stepping. Look at this.
Geoff.
yeah? - Your problem...
...you don't see the big picture. - My problem is that you're a stubborn fool.
for a brilliant man, you show an alarming lack of judgment when it counts most.
I don't care what happens to me.
and I'm not afraid, because I'm right.
thank you very much.
a grateful John Engler enjoys the thrill of his victory for a third term as Michigan's governor. He trumps his Democratic opponent.
geoffrey Fieger has to feel somewhat humiliated today.
this is a man who's not used to losing, not used to losing the big one certainly...
... and the voters of Michigan have pretty resoundingly said:
Geoffrey, we might hire you if we had a legal case...
... but we don't want you to be our governor.
pre-trial hearings get underway today on the People of the State of Michigan v. Jack Kevorkian.
now, this is following that controversial broadcast of a videotape showing Dr. Jack Kevorkian giving a fatal dose of chemicals to Thomas Youk on the news program 60 Minutes.
a wide array of protest groups have amassed outside the Oakland County Courthouse...
...contentiously voicing both their opposition and support.
one way or another, this is Dr. Jack Kevorkian's fifth trial...
...and it very well may be his last.
I've looked at all the motions. Mr. Gorosh, I'm denying your motions to quash all the charges against Dr. Kevorkian.
there's no basis to dismiss.
but I do think there is an argument here that murder and assisted suicide are incompatible charges by definition.
well, that may be something to be debated in a law-school class...
...but not in my courtroom.
and Mr. Skrzynski, I am granting your motion to limit testimony on the murder charge, but not on assisted suicide.
a person's pain and suffering is very relevant when defending an assisted-suicide charge.
trial starts in five days. - Okay, thank you.
it just occurred to me...
...why don't we drop the assisted-suicide charge altogether?
what are you saying?
I'm saying that what proved lethal in all our other cases was the family members testifying...
...juries hearing about conditions of the victims...
...how much pain they were in, all that bullshit.
if we drop the charge, make it all or nothing on murder...
...the widow, the brother, they won't get to testify.
precisely.
just take all that sympathy out of the courtroom.
do you understand, Dr. Kevorkian that you are charged with first-degree murder and delivery of a controlled substance?
and that the assisted-suicide charge has been dropped?
I do. Yes.
you understand that you could spend the rest of your life in prison?
whatever's left of it, sure.
you understand what prison is?
did you see The Shawshank Redemption, sir?
no.
do you understand you may not disrupt or inconvenience the court in any way, shape, or form?
I will act like the guest that I am.
you're no guest, you're the defendant.
what do you think of Dr. Jack Kevorkian actually helping people kill themselves?
well, my grandma's very sick and, you know...
... every day she asks me, "Bring me Jack Kevorkian."
doctors are supposed to uphold a Hippocratic oath though, save lives.
I understand people are dying and should be dying gracefully with dignity and honor.
I don't think we ought to put them out to pasture.
I think he rocks. He gives people a choice of whether or not they want to suffer throughout terminal illness or not.
Dr. Kevorkian is one of the most audacious serial killers this country has ever known.
let's say your mother wanted his help, wanted to kill herself...
... what would you think of that?
well, if she was mentally competent...
... I would ask what she wanted, and support her.
the names of dozens of other people who died with the help of Jack Kevorkian...
... laid out on the courthouse lawn to make a point.
conviction is important because Jack Kevorkian is the most public symbol of the euthanasia movement, and we need to stop him.
please tell us Dr. Dragovic, did Mr. Youk's ALS contribute to his death at all?
no. - Then how did he die?
he was poisoned by intravenously-injected substances.
is homicide always murder, doctor?
no, sir. - When is it not murder?
objection. It's a legal question.
sir, you may question him in regard to his autopsy report...
... but nothing further that's legal.
but why? Look, l...
if you consulted your attorney, he'd tell you why.
okay. Is euthanasia always murder? - Objection.
always homicide?
Yes, sir. - Yes, it's always homicide.
and you stated that homicide is not necessarily always murder.
therefore...
...out of pure logic, wouldn't you say that euthanasia's not always murder?
objection. Calls for a legal conclusion. - No, it calls for simple logic.
it's... It's a syllogism. It calls for nothing but syllogism.
again, you're asking him to make a legal conclusion.
no, but this is a mathematical conclusion. It's simple arithmetic.
I don't know shit about the law either, but I know when I'm watching a train wreck.
Yeah, well, I told him Gorosh is a putz.
it can't possibly be a fair fight.
you gotta do something, Geoff. Anything.
Dr. Kevorkian, Tom's brother's flight from France got delayed...
...but he will be here soon.
okay. Don't worry, we're gonna get you both on the stand to testify.
I know you wanna call Melody Youk as your first witness...
...but what is it that she's going to testify to?
well, she's going to testify about my intent.
and what she observed, and our discussions...
Dr. Kevorkian, that has no relevance here.
I assumed your counsel would have advised you about this,that once the assisted-suicide charge was dropped...
...you could no longer put these witnesses before the jury.
Yeah, but I'm talking about what went on, you know, as to my intent.
your feeling compelled to help Mr. Youk is not a legal defense.
and you're already aware that a person's condition has no bearing in a murder case.
but that I didn't kill her husband, you see?
this is relevant. - Okay. Okay.
we'll make a special record, outside the presence of the jury.
I will rule on that.
Oh, okay. - All right?
okay. Thank you. - Thank you.
melody, did you tell me it was your intention or Tom's intention that I kill him?
Oh, no, no. That was not our intent.
and when I met you, I felt it was not your intent.
it was never your intent or our intent that Tom...
there it is, there it is. You see?
other than... Released from his suffering.
so the word "kill," did it ever crop up?
or "murder"? - No.
no. Ugly words. Ugly, ugly words.
you're talking about mercy killing.
and her statements can't show your state of mind, they only show hers.
therefore, I cannot allow her to testify before the jury.
but wait, I wanna say something. I have so much I wanna say.
I have been waiting for four goddamned months for this opportunity.
you may call it mercy killing, I call it something else.
I call it a medical service for an agonized, incurably suffering patient.
that's what I call it. All right?
what difference does it make what you call it?
when you have these fine stipulations of law...
... standing in the way of a dedicated physician.
and I am a dedicated physician.
I mean, my integrity would be destroyed if I turned my back on that patient.
I would rather be dead. It's far worse.
you could take my life, it'd be worse.
this was a service. This was a service.
it had nothing to do with "kill" or "murder." It was a service.
it was a medical service that was being done.
I can't be clearer. I can't be clearer than that, Your Honor.
I see the emotion, I understand it, but it's not relevant.
please step down, Mrs. Youk.
okay.
it's okay.
Jessica Cooper has already ruled that Dr. Kevorkian's side can't put into evidence that there was suffering here by the victim.
does that make any sense? - No, see, I think it's an improper ruling.
both in terms of the nature of this trial and criminal defenses in general.
you're entitled to put forward any plausible defense to explain the context of your act...
... and she's already limited him from doing that.
it's like watching a man hang himself. Once you knew they were dropping the assisted-suicide charge what was your plan?
he doesn't let me help him. What am I supposed to do?
you're supposed to get creative.
why didn't you argue that Youk's wife and brother were eyewitnesses to the event the prosecutor's calling a murder?
then Cooper would've had to have let them testify. But that window's closed now.
did you ever pass the fucking bar exam?
Dave.
there are those who would say about Dr. Jack Kevorkian:
right message, wrong messenger.
and who is the right messenger?
now, I'm confused about this, Dr. Kevorkian.
you said you had another witness.
I'm not allowing his testimony on the same grounds I didn't allow Mrs. Youk's.
I'm sorry you flew all this way, Mr. Youk.
would you like to take the stand in your own defense, Dr. Kevorkian?
I'm sorry.
sir, would you like to take the stand in your own defense?
Oh, I heard you. I did.
you know, I don't lie and I don't exaggerate.
and...
...you know, you never said why.
you accuse me of these heinous things, but you never said why. Did you?
no, just saying. I'm just saying.
you know, just so you know.
sir, let's keep to the relevance here.
Oh, this is... Oh, it's not relevant? I guess it's not.
it's not relevant.
I will ask you again, would you like to take the stand in your own defense, sir?
it's now or never.
never.
no. No.
the defense rests.
not since Ruby killed Oswald did we see a murder on television.
Jack Kevorkian came like a hit man in the night with a bag of poison to do his job.
what would happen if he got his way and made the state policy euthanasia?
what could go wrong?
well, there are 11 million souls buried in Europe that can tell you that when you make euthanasia a state policy...
...catastrophic things can evolve from opening up that box.
how dare you?! - Dr Kevorkian...
how dare you compare euthanasia with the genocide?!
how dare you?! - You have crossed the line!
where is your decency and respect?
order in this court.
we will take a brief recess.
do you see a criminal?
do you see a murderer?
if you do, then you must convict.
and then take the harsh judgment of history...
...and the even harsher judgment of your children and their children...
...if they should ever come to need this choice in their lives.
I just ask you to think about that.
guilty of the lesser charge of second-degree murder.
and with regard to Count 2, what is your verdict?
guilty of delivery of a controlled substance.
this is just wrong.
Yes.
you invited yourself here to make a final stand.
you invited yourself to the wrong forum.
our nation tolerates differences of opinions...
...because we have a civilized and non-violent way of resolving our conflicts.
we have the means and methods to protest laws with which we disagree.
you can criticize the law, lecture about the law...
...speak to the media or petition voters...
...but you must always stay within the limits provided by the law.
you may not break the law or take the law into your own hands.
no one's unmindful of the controversy and emotion that exists over end-of-life issues and pain control.
I assume the debate will continue in a calm and reasoned forum long after this trial and your activities have faded from the public memory.
but this trial was not about that controversy.
this trial was about you, sir.
you've ignored and challenged the legislature and the Supreme Court.
moreover, you've defied your own medical profession.
this trial was about lawlessnessabout your disregard for a society that exists and flourishes because of the strength of our legal system.
no one is above the law.
you had the audacity to go on national television...
... show the world what you did, and dare the legal system to stop you.
you publicly and repeatedly announced your intentions to disregard the laws of Michigan.
because of this, I am imposing the maximum sentence of 10 to 25 years.
you may now, sir, consider yourself stopped.
we will be reaching our destination in fifteen minutes.
the enemy's airplane.
Mayday! Mayday! We are under attack.
you must jump now.
go!
the Japanese are coming. Hurry up.
let's go.
you just go now.
save yourself.
when did he call?
an hour ago. Captain.
before the General and her ladyship got here.
he warned us to keep an eye on her diamond necklace.
he will snatch it during the show. sir.
have you informed the General yet?
I didn't dare, sir.
good.
don't let anyone know about this.
I'll handle it myself.
hello.
this way, Darling.
excuse me.
good evening, sir.
Kom Wang Hin?
Kom Wang Hin!
he loves rading.
killing!
Raping!
bugger!
what's the matter, Captain?
I don't want to ruin your night over that two-bit thief.
I'm afraid you and your wife will be distracted from the show.
but his treats are so disrespectful to you!
I've heard of him.
he's one of the great thieves, isn't he?
Oh, no.
that's just a rumour.
he's nobody.
he's just a two-bit thief.
captain...
you have to take this seriously.
just tell me what you want.
my men are ready to help.
Yes, sir.
no need to worry, darling.
you look so worried.
I do, of course.
when he sets his sihgts on something he always gets it.
it's true he's never failed.
but Captain Harn is here.
the police department's best man.
even with angel wings the thief couldn't get in here.
that's right, ma'am.
and if he does get in he won't survive.
see？
he has everything under control.
don't worry, darling.
darling!
you dirty old man!
that's why I couldn't feel any necklace.
or any neck wrinkles, either!
who shot the gun?
what are you waiting for?
follow me.
bastard! How dare he! -Darling.
is your necklace all right? -It's still here.
I'll take care of it.
excuse me, sir.
Yes, Captain?
how is it going?
nothing so far, sir.
see, darling?
even now they have nothing at all!
excuse me, your Ladyship.
I wonder if you remember what the thief looked like.
more handsome than you, of course!
darling...
in a few days
I have to go to a banquet.
what will I wear then?
this one also looks great.
you should wear it. Nobody Will know.
maybe they won't but I know it's fake.
it gives me a rash around my neck!
I'll buy you a new one later.
please wear this one for now.
I'm still paying the instalments on the first one!
what are you laughing about?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'd like to make a promise.
he will be a jailbird for ages.
Jailbird?
right now he's free as a bird!
I don't trust you any more.
how could such a two-bit thief evade the whole police force?
how could he steal it from under my nose?
I've got an excellent plan for you.
again？
what damn plan？
it takes a thief to catch a thief, sir.
it stinks in here!
excuse me.
are you that bastard named Yai Tarua the great thief of the Chao Phraya River?
who the hell are you?
why are you bothering me this early in the morning?
don't you know who you are speaking to?
it's all right, Captain.
I didn't much want to come here.
but l bring best regards from someone in hell!
Kom Wang Hin!
I don't give a damn how big you are don't mention that bastard's name again!
Yai Tarua.
you are too big for your boots!
but I like you. I'm here for one reason.
I'll give you your freedom if you can find Kom and bring him to me.
interested?
are you Kom Wang Hin?
just say what you want.
did your boss send you to pick me up?
Yes.
the boss is waiting for you.
I'm the one he's waiting for.
Kom Wang Hin.
Kom...
don't you know General Sun is hunting for you?
are you stupid or crazy?
how dare you provoke him and then try to sell the necklace to me?
I hope you're not saying that just to get a better price.
you think I'm some kind of pawnbroker?
whatever I want
I can pay whatever it costs.
in wartime like this money is rare.
it's of great quality, sir.
fifty thousand.
I'll give you half that.
forty thousand.
thirty thousand. Enough.
thirty is fine.
dishonest deals involve dishonest prices.
I understand you have to save your money to hire men to rob a Japanese train.
where did you get that from?
Oh, Lam.
everyone knows that.
don't panic.
what do you want?
how about this?
you let me do it and give me a share.
I won't take much.
and if anything goes wrong you don't have to get involved.
just follow my plan.
what do you think, Chua?
I don't trust him.
he's got a forked tongue.
how does he know about our gold robbery?
he must have read the paper.
you idiot!
I smell a mole.
find him!
who's that?
thief!
toh Teen Nak.
good evening. -Good evening.
be careful!
you'll break it!
slow down.
he's here.
I was told you wanted to see me.
I am Pratuang.
professor Rawee sent me to see you.
I'm very glad to meet a member of Thai Thieves.
so you're a member of the Free Thai Movement.
that is right.
I've got a message for you.
our spies will get here to co-operate with you.
you keep this pocket watch.
they will find you.
is there anyone else?
no.
I know how to deal with the girl.
have you finished yet?
not yet, sir. Please give me more time.
all right.
we'll take her to Thailand.
Yes, sir.
you bitch!
come on.
you're dreaming.
I know where Kom is.
just follow me.
we only accept members.
who the hell are you?
everyone! Don't move!
this is personal!
yai, your manners never improve.
for you...
no bloody manners needed!
this is polite enough!
Thanks, buddy.
who are you calling buddy?
today I'll clean my feet with your blood!
Yai...
do you know why you were in jail while I was earning my money here?
it's because I'm smarter than you!
what do you want?
you want your little man blown off?
where the hell is Kom?
I don't know.
look at all those planes.
Kom, you son of a bitch!
Hey! This is dangerous!
Kom!
quick, quick!
no, no.
you'll probably disappear just like them.
Toh...
the Japs have got two guys.
I guess...
they're the spies you're looking for.
the Japs always get them!
no matter how many spies were sent they were all caught.
now we'll have to rescue them.
and then what? Damm it!
anyway...
just follow my plan.
here you're behind the hill.
then you come here.
you three, remember this.
the three of you move to the top of the hill.
you three are behind the hill.
you got that?
you know 'behind the hill'?
repeat after me. Behind the hill.
behind the hill. -Behind the hill.
correct.
then another three come here.
you are here.
on the left. Here.
but then where am l?
wait, wait.
I'm still here.
not in the middle.
the Japs can get me there.
do I make myself understood?
no.
damm it!
you bastard!
you've got the wrong guy.
I'm not a spy!
why don't you give me anything to eat?
are you just going to let me die?
let me go!
I don't even know that bastard!
stop yapping.
what are you, a damn dog?
tie him up!
why the hell are you putting me in this sack?
don't you think it's damn hot?
tell me who you are!
out with it!
when the dark clouds are blown away hundreds of birds fly high.
free from clouds so dark that they hide the moon from sight.
what the hell are you talking about?
we are saved!
go get them!
let go of me!
the Japs are running away.
go get them.
I'm not that bloody spy!
let me go.
we are on the same side.
don't shoot me!
we are on the same side. Help me!
it's time for a samurai to duel with a Thai swordsman.
no problem.
go ahead and find out if a Japanese or Thai sword is faster and sharper.
be my guest.
now you know.
he's dead.
someone dies everyday.
my brother!
why do you leave me?
he's gone.
seriously, are you a spy?
Yes. We're spies.
we are brothers.
he's the eldest. I'm the youngest.
we've worked together since we were children.
and what will you do now when your brother has gone?
I have another mission.
a very confidential one ...in Bangkok.
by the way, I thank you very much.
what is your name?
my name is 'Big Foot'.
want to know how big it is?
Oh, no.
thank you.
I'll ask my unit to send you the letter of appreciation.
no need.
we've fought for the kingdom and the Thai people.
we've never wanted any reward.
I must start my mission now.
all right.
Oh, no!
they took all my stuff!
what's wrong now?
the Japs took all my money!
why did you let them take it?
can you give me twenty baht?
Damn! Go and get it from the Japs.
they took all my money.
I need it to go on with my mission.
OK, let's pitch in twenty baht for his trip to Bangkok.
are you all deaf or what?
doesn't anyone got any money at all?
okay. Stop crying!
how much?
twenty baht, sir.
Damn!
if my kids begged like this I'd knock their heads off!
here you are.
thank you.
this will cover the trip.
but what about food?
without food, I'll starve to death!
then my mission will be impossible.
I'll tell my unit that you wouldn't co-operate.
don't you dare!
here you are.
now stop whining.
and keep your mouth shut in Bangkok.
thank you.
damm it.
I really appreciate this.
that's all right.
without your help, I wouldn't make it.
we are Thai. We help each other.
next time it'll be my turn to help.
that's all right.
thank you very much.
what about him?
what should we do about him?
should we leave him like this?
or find a place to bury him?
let's give him a burial.
okay. Everybody give him a hand.
three or four bodies daily.
what a heavy corpse!
bury him near the fruit tree in case he's hungry.
you're a real bastard!
you stole my wife's necklace.
but then what?
you got caught anyway.
sir...
should we press charges against him?
no, we won't press charges against him.
I'll cut him with my samurai sword and bury him alive!
but it's against the law, sir.
are you going to stop me?
I have one more thing to tell you.
go ahead.
I know that he's got a much bigger plan up his sleeve.
tell him, bastard!
you bastard!
tell me what the hell's going on!
Yai...
don't think you'll get your hands on my gold!
if I don't get it you won't either.
what gold?
the Japs' gold.
they plan to rob the train.
what?
why don't we know about this, Captain?
untie him.
piece of cake.
my share is 90%.
you two share the rest.
what about me?
it's my plan!
if everything works out
I'll set you free.
don't let money be your master.
as long as you're alive, you can earn more.
relax.
then give me another 10%.
no negotiation.
I have the final word.
tell you what
I'll be in charge.
how are you? -Yai...
Yao!
look! Who's here?
where are you going?
come over here.
finished yet?
if yes, get out.
I haven't seen you for ages.
your shit still smells bad!
we're in public.
don't you respect the law?
do I look like a coward?
what made you think this tiny knife could scare me?
Argh, a gun!
I give up! Don't shoot!
No! No! OK, I am a coward.
you cheated me out of 180 baht in that card game.
No! It's 200 baht!
interest included.
that's all there is.
I saw something like gold.
there's nothing.
nothing? Just check his ass!
kiss it, more like!
come on!
Hey! That's my mother's.
I don't care.
make it quick!
there's nothing left.
give me that!
what do you want my pants for?
because I want them.
what will I wear?
I'll cut it off.
stay out of our business.
God bless you.
let's go.
you asshole!
you bastard!
come back here!
let's fight!
I'll show you how to box!
somebody help! Give me my pants.
I'm shy, of course.
is anyone here?
not even a dog?
how can I leave here?
captain, did you book the hotel for me?
don't forget to find me some girls, too.
I don't like to sleep alone.
but, sir...
I'm afraid if your Ladyship finds out
I'll be blamed, sir.
then don't let her find out, dammit!
why the hell are you always in my way?
what can I do for you, sir?
anything you need, just let me know.
captain, keep your mouth shut!
if my wife finds out, you'll be held responsible.
but, sir...
this is unethical.
that's enough, Captain.
you'd better quit and become a monk.
Kom, when's the car picking us up?
I'm dying for a shit.
very nice to meet you.
you, too.
you recognise me?
y es.
I hope we can work well together.
but I don't think we should talk here.
we should find a private place.
whatever you say.
I'll be okay. -Fine.
please give me a few minutes.
are you in a hurry?
no, I'm not.
may I use the toilet?
be my guest.
there's someone following me.
come and hide in here.
okay.
no problem. I got hit yesterday.
okay. Just hide in there.
we're from the government.
sorry. We are assigned to search your place.
wait. What's the matter?
only my husband and I stay in this room.
I'm afraid it's a misunderstanding.
please accept my apologies.
something in my stomach must be rotten!
Hey, who is this man?
he's another Free Thai Movement member who will take us to help Zeena.
sorry.
hello.
hello.
you have to help Zeena.
let's go.
where are we going?
general Sun wants to see you.
make it quick.
sir.
any news?
the train carrying gold will get here in 3 days.
Damn! You made me wait here all night with mosquitos biting my bollocks off ...just for that?
if there's any more news
I'll inform you at once.
I have to go. It's late.
can we trust this bastard, Captain?
I wouldn't, sir.
he's a crook!
I, as the leader of this Thai community ...would like us all to drink a toast to General Yamada on his promotion.
on behalf of the Japanese Emperor's soldiers
I appreciate the Thai people's welcome tonight.
but I believe there is still a group of Thais who have been determined to oppose the peace-making process of both countries.
I vow...
not to bow down to them.
they will be arrested and suppressed to the maximum degree.
how is everything going upstairs?
it's very crowded.
what have you got?
here you are.
you almost poked me in the face with that!
light!
Lam! You traitor!
you don't deserve to live!
you help the Japs to kill Thai people.
you'll pay for that.
why the hell did you let it off?
it almost exploded!
light the fire!
who dares mess up my place?
get back to the base.
sir...
the party tonight sounds enjoyable.
girls are screaming with joy.
fortunately Lam isn't good at barbecuing.
the Japs deserve burnt food!
find them!
who are they? Find them!
can't you see what's going on?
it's not only us that want their gold.
anyway...
let them play hard until their strength is gone.
