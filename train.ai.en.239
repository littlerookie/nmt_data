I mean, that never happens.
I mean, that never occurred to you?
I mean, that new house is taking shape.
I mean, that noise
I mean, that nose thing. Fine, we can deal with that.
I mean, that obviously wasn't working and, um,
I mean, that one - hour record... Pure brilliance.
I mean, that one - hour record... Pure brilliance.
I mean, that part of the story is true.
I mean, that part, it's a mountain.
I mean, that passage was written in 1989.
I mean, that photo, it was awful,
I mean, that photograph, though, that you sent to the police of Andre...
I mean, that place had been .
I mean, that place was awful.
I mean, that really black arterial blood,
I mean, that really black arterial blood,
I mean, that really got out of hand fast.
I mean, that right there is half the reason why everybody's so angry, yeah?
I mean, that room reeked of musk.
I mean, that saves, right?
I mean, that seems like something
I mean, that shop is completely out of control since you left.
I mean, that should be worth - what do you think, five covers at least?
I mean, that should have been the first thing out of your mouth.
I mean, that should solve all our security issues.
I mean, that show did a lot of great things for all of us.
I mean, that show must be sold out for at least two years!
I mean, that show must be sold out for at least two years!
I mean, that shows premeditation.
I mean, that sounds kinda -
I mean, that sounds like a terrorist cell.
I mean, that sounds like science to me. Maybe not pure, but...
I mean, that sounds like the least you deserve.
I mean, that sounds more like me than you.
I mean, that special place where she lives,
I mean, that spells "real man" in my book.
I mean, that spring I saw him, he was practically skin and bones (excuse the grandmotherly expression.)
I mean, that stuff's pretty hard to come by.
I mean, that takes more than just a little tap.
I mean, that terrain was something serious.
I mean, that thing is good.
I mean, that thing you do with your hips.
I mean, that tiny amount of material is surely not be able to
I mean, that took a lot of guts.
I mean, that tramp we heard about, the one who drowned last week.
I mean, that type of thing didn't happen with the guys.
I mean, that view right there, that view of the city, I mean, that is unbelievable,
I mean, that voice of hers -
I mean, that voice of hers -
I mean, that voice of hers...
I mean, that waltz alone reminds me of old people.
I mean, that was - that was incredible!
I mean, that was - that was intimate.
I mean, that was - what I did was just completely,
I mean, that was a big deal for me.
I mean, that was a big story.
I mean, that was a compliment, right?
I mean, that was a lot of work.
I mean, that was a travesty if I ever saw one.
I mean, that was amazing. For me, too.
I mean, that was amazing.
I mean, that was an accident, it's chance, no sense to it.
I mean, that was before you met grandpa Jimmy, right?
I mean, that was definitely not my plan.
I mean, that was entertainment at its best. You can't beat that.
I mean, that was good, right?
I mean, that was her life. I have to take care of it.
I mean, that was his legal address?
I mean, that was his legal address? Now he's the victim of a homicide.
I mean, that was his life.
I mean, that was idiotic, though. You have to understand that.
I mean, that was it.
I mean, that was it. That's... That was all I could take.
I mean, that was just butt - ugly. That was horrible.
I mean, that was just perfection.
I mean, that was just perfection.
I mean, that was just so...

I mean, that was kind of a shock.
I mean, that was like a...
I mean, that was like kissing my sister.
I mean, that was like kissing my sister.
I mean, that was never the problem.
I mean, that was nice of you, but don't you worryhe'll spend it on crack?
I mean, that was our life.
I mean, that was our life.
I mean, that was our plan, was to take other people's money
I mean, that was pretty damn good.
I mean, that was pretty damn good.
I mean, that was pretty freaking gay of Chuck, huh?
I mean, that was pretty freaking gay of Chuck, huh?
I mean, that was pretty freaking gay of Chuck, huh?
I mean, that was really a blindside.
I mean, that was sort of the point of it, I thought.
I mean, that was supposed to be a nice neighborhood you placed us in.
I mean, that was that was intimate.
I mean, that was the 4400 center.
I mean, that was the audition.
I mean, that was the basis of our relationship, right -
I mean, that was the deal.
I mean, that was the plan. - no.
I mean, that was the third date.
I mean, that was the whole point.
I mean, that was tight.
I mean, that was very inspiring to me.
I mean, that was very wrong, indeed, boys -
I mean, that was what the guilty plea was all about.
I mean, that was why we tolerated you in the band
I mean, that was you.
I mean, that was... Ooh!
I mean, that was... What is he talking about?
I mean, that was...
I mean, that wasn't even my photo in the paper. I don't even have a job there.
I mean, that wasn't the nose she was born with,
I mean, that wasn't the plan.
I mean, that wasn't...
I mean, that way you don't have to worry about me
I mean, that way, they'll just feel like they're part of the process.
I mean, that way, you still did all the stuff,
I mean, that we have a plan.
I mean, that we're all Stardust.
I mean, that whole thing is rubbish.
I mean, that woman has not looked good in 12 years.
I mean, that would be a reason to stay,
I mean, that would be a total violation of the code.
I mean, that would be a very sad statement to suggest we're the
I mean, that would be crazy, insane.
I mean, that would be great if that could happen.
I mean, that would be great.
I mean, that would be insane.
I mean, that would be insane. It would be disloyal.
I mean, that would be like
I mean, that would be like having sex with PBS.
I mean, that would be really helpful, right?
I mean, that would be sexual harassment. And I was a witness.
I mean, that would be so cool.
I mean, that would be totally uncool,
I mean, that would be, what do you call it? Witness tampering.
I mean, that would be... Oh, it's what I do.
I mean, that would be
I mean, that would explain
I mean, that would explain why
I mean, that would explain why he completely disappeared.
I mean, that would give us a real leg up.
I mean, that would keep her busy, and I could get some super-cute new sweaters.
I mean, that would make anyone believe there were monsters under their bed.
I mean, that would put us in the right time frame.
I mean, that would put usin the right time frame.
I mean, that would suck, but - but I get it.
I mean, that would suck, but - but I get it.
I mean, that wouldn't be very smart.
I mean, that wouldn't fool a 2- year - old.
I mean, that you might be... He's gonna kill you!
I mean, that you were who you were. Then why didn't you tell him the truth?
I mean, that you're travelling with the doctor?
I mean, that you're travelling with the doctor?
I mean, that'd be a weird thing, huh?
I mean, that'd be crazy, right?
I mean, that'd be enough to make any man happy.
I mean, that'd be kind of shitty to cut him out now, don't you think?
I mean, that'd be some kind of coincidence.
I mean, that's -
I mean, that's - that' s - that's great.
I mean, that's - that's all there is.
I mean, that's - that's ancient his tory.
I mean, that's - that's what kids do.
I mean, that's - that's what's important, not some stupid trip to the zoo.
I mean, that's 100 grand.
I mean, that's Cole's game.
I mean, that's Oahu, not here.
I mean, that's a big gamble.
I mean, that's a blessing.
I mean, that's a diseased pod. You port into that...
I mean, that's a dream come true.
I mean, that's a face you can't forget.
I mean, that's a fact.
I mean, that's a fair assumption, right?
I mean, that's a fucking joke. Happy pill? They was like cunts.
I mean, that's a given. It's a sexy thing.
I mean, that's a good thing, isn't it?
I mean, that's a good thing, right?
I mean, that's a hell of a first step.
I mean, that's a little harsh, no?
I mean, that's a long time for a teenager.
I mean, that's a long time for the girls to beoaway from school, isn't it?
I mean, that's a long way off.
I mean, that's a lot of energy.
I mean, that's a lot of hard work.
I mean, that's a lot of money.
I mean, that's a lot to go up against.
I mean, that's a lot to go up against.
I mean, that's a million - to - one shot in your racket.
I mean, that's a perfect recipe for puing a crashed plane back together.
I mean, that's a plausible amount of volatility
I mean, that's a pretty big coincidence, isn't it?
I mean, that's a pretty good result.
I mean, that's a problem from a company perspective.
I mean, that's a really big deal.
I mean, that's a really good place to start.
I mean, that's a rough situation.
I mean, that's a side of you I really never get to see, Mr. Bris tow.
I mean, that's a trifecta.
I mean, that's a valuable room. Why waste it?
I mean, that's a...
I mean, that's about ensuring public safety
I mean, that's about what I havein my decorating budget.
I mean, that's all I know.
I mean, that's all I need.
I mean, that's all I really like.
I mean, that's all great, but...
I mean, that's all he's gonna care about.
I mean, that's all kids ever do.
I mean, that's all kids ever do.
I mean, that's all there is to it. don't get me started on this.
I mean, that's all they were good for.
I mean, that's all we got out of the car.
I mean, that's all you got sometime, you know?
I mean, that's all you need, innit?
I mean, that's all you need, innit?
I mean, that's all.
I mean, that's amazing. Nah, it's nothing.
I mean, that's amazing. Nah, it's nothing.
I mean, that's an action movie.
I mean, that's an anomaly. You said that yourself.
I mean, that's an incredible thing about a child.
I mean, that's an incredible thing about a child.
I mean, that's articles, that's museum exhibits, that's money for the program.
I mean, that's assistant stuff, right? Part of my job?
I mean, that's assuming he is AdEx.
I mean, that's assuming that cockroaches are capable...
I mean, that's assuming that you want to.
I mean, that's assuming we get those stargazer lilies for the bouquets.
I mean, that's assuming you still want to be a part of it.
I mean, that's brilliant.
I mean, that's business, right?
I mean, that's clearly the road we're headed down, and marriage is just one of...
I mean, that's clearly the road we're headed down,
I mean, that's close to impossible.
I mean, that's comme il faut, right?
I mean, that's contempt, that is.
I mean, that's cool, I'm the headline at grand slam.
I mean, that's cool.
I mean, that's crap!
I mean, that's crazy talk. You know, there are live sporting events on TV
I mean, that's crazy, right?
I mean, that's crazy.
I mean, that's deep South hoodoo stuff.
I mean, that's definitely you, but...
I mean, that's difference in the game.
I mean, that's difference in the game.
I mean, that's drug money.
I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine.
I mean, that's enough to make anybody lose it a little bit.
I mean, that's everything I've been doing this year -
I mean, that's exactly the kind of hook
I mean, that's exactly what I think is happening here.
I mean, that's exactly what it is, you know?
I mean, that's first I've heard of it.
I mean, that's flattering.
I mean, that's for sure.
I mean, that's freedom, man.
I mean, that's getting to eat the pie
I mean, that's going to be me and you in 30 years.
I mean, that's going to take God knows how long?
I mean, that's gonna require a lot of manpower.
I mean, that's gonna take God knows how long!
I mean, that's gonna take god knows how long!
I mean, that's gonna take some time.
I mean, that's good stuff. Good stuff.
I mean, that's good, right?
I mean, that's good, right?
I mean, that's good.
I mean, that's got to be a ritual, man.
I mean, that's got to count for something.
I mean, that's gotta be a huge turnoff for you.
I mean, that's gotta be...
I mean, that's gotta hurt, right?
I mean, that's gotta mean something, right?
I mean, that's great, but...
I mean, that's great, right,
I mean, that's great, right, since you're treating this case just like any other.
I mean, that's great. Yeah.
I mean, that's happened...
I mean, that's hardly conclusive.
I mean, that's hilarious, but not if it's my kids.
I mean, that's his -
I mean, that's his job. He's the cleaner.
I mean, that's how I know we were set up.
I mean, that's how I like my solitude: alone.
I mean, that's how I think of myself
I mean, that's how I win.
I mean, that's how I've always seen it, even these last few years.
I mean, that's how I've always thought of him.
I mean, that's how deep this went.
I mean, that's how he refers to you as his 15 year old son.
I mean, that's how it sounded in my head.
I mean, that's how it worked for my mom.
I mean, that's how it works, huh? You help me. I help you.
I mean, that's how obscure of a thing it was.
I mean, that's how people relate.
I mean, that's how things got done.
I mean, that's how this whole thing kind of started, you know.
I mean, that's how this whole thing kind of started, you know.
I mean, that's how you caught him, right?
I mean, that's how you have to think of it.
I mean, that's impossible.
I mean, that's impressive enough.
I mean, that's in the past. I'm just saying.
I mean, that's incredible. I, uh...
I mean, that's inhumane.
I mean, that's it for me.
I mean, that's it.
I mean, that's it. She wasn't really...
I mean, that's it. That is reality.
I mean, that's just a metaphor.
I mean, that's just because she hated mom so much for
I mean, that's just cold. Okay, who's the guy?
I mean, that's just crass. Right?
I mean, that's just crazy.
I mean, that's just dumb.
I mean, that's just gross.
I mean, that's just kind of for you.
I mean, that's just life.
I mean, that's just mean.
I mean, that's just mean. This business is mean.
I mean, that's just one Bible story that I just don't like.
I mean, that's just preposterous.
I mean, that's just roommates 101.
I mean, that's just siIIy, you know? We need to be daring, without batteries.
I mean, that's just so...
I mean, that's just stupid.
I mean, that's just way too close.
I mean, that's just what you always see in the movies.
I mean, that's just who I am.
I mean, that's just your solution to everything!
I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism.
I mean, that's just...
I mean, that's just... Not the only option.
I mean, that's just... Wonderful.
I mean, that's kind of a bummer too.
I mean, that's kind of demeaning.
I mean, that's kind of hard to do.
I mean, that's kind of how...
I mean, that's kind of like the pirate in the bad sense, you know?
I mean, that's kind of the problem.
I mean, that's kind of the way it works between mothers and daughters.
I mean, that's kind of weird, right?
I mean, that's kind of what happened.
I mean, that's like - it's like "cat on a hot tin roof."
I mean, that's like a million points, right?
I mean, that's like a philosophical question
I mean, that's like a sports team almost when you think about it.
I mean, that's like a sports team almost when you think about it. Plus, the platinum alone, it's worth about $50 billion.
I mean, that's like defacing a dollar bill,
I mean, that's like defacing a dollar bill,
I mean, that's like really taboo.
I mean, that's like... Well, something I would do.
I mean, that's management 101, you know - no fistfights, so I booted him.
I mean, that's more than I've given to anyone.
I mean, that's murder, isn't it?
I mean, that's my job, that's what I do. Yeah, you're screwed.
I mean, that's my mom.
I mean, that's my mom.
I mean, that's no excuse, really.
I mean, that's normal, right, giving thank - you cards?
I mean, that's not -
I mean, that's not a good word.
I mean, that's not easy.
I mean, that's not even a choice anymore,
I mean, that's not even close to blue book.
I mean, that's not exactly something you want on your fortune 500 bio... Or at your wedding, so...
I mean, that's not gonna help.
I mean, that's not good. It's not a safe place. I don't like that.
I mean, that's not good. It's not a safe place. I don't like that.
I mean, that's not greed we're looking at it. It's grief.
I mean, that's not like teaching. That's more like a magic trick.
I mean, that's not me.
I mean, that's not much to go on.
I mean, that's not my thing.
I mean, that's not possible, is it?
I mean, that's not really an open conference area
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?
I mean, that's not what I signed up for.
I mean, that's not why I'm not pregnant.
I mean, that's not why we came, right?
I mean, that's one of the toughest steps for any guy to be able to do.
I mean, that's one possible scenario.
I mean, that's one possible scenario.
I mean, that's one thing I will not do.
I mean, that's part of Christmas, too, right?
I mean, that's part of what's wrong with everything.
I mean, that's perfect timing.
I mean, that's personal use. It's not like he was selling.
I mean, that's pretty amazing!
I mean, that's pretty cut and dry.
I mean, that's pretty damn amazing, even for you.
I mean, that's pretty extreme, isn't it?
I mean, that's pretty perfect.
I mean, that's pretty skanky.
I mean, that's pretty skanky.
I mean, that's pretty wild, huh?
I mean, that's probably not even her real name.
I mean, that's protocol in these types of operations.
I mean, that's psycho. No, it's genius.
I mean, that's quite a brave and unusual thing in our society today.
I mean, that's rare. It's valuable.
I mean, that's really exciting.
I mean, that's really insuiting, to get the toe, isn't it?
I mean, that's really put me
I mean, that's really rude.
I mean, that's really useful.
I mean, that's really what everybody wants to know.
I mean, that's really what you think I'm doing?
I mean, that's really, really terrible.
I mean, that's really...
I mean, that's retarded. That's absurd -
I mean, that's ridiculous.
I mean, that's right. I like that.
I mean, that's so convenient for you.
I mean, that's so soon.
I mean, that's some epic desperateness, ain't it?
I mean, that's something .
I mean, that's something new that was just added.
I mean, that's something that you value, right?
I mean, that's something to campaign on.
I mean, that's something we should talk about, right?
I mean, that's something... That's because I look like a beast.
I mean, that's sortable, we can just sort it,
I mean, that's the Antwone Fisher story.
I mean, that's the Yangtze river dolphin story through and through,
I mean, that's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends.
I mean, that's the bigger insult to marriage
I mean, that's the idea. You gotta find character in your subject.
I mean, that's the job, right?
I mean, that's the journey.
I mean, that's the kind of great weird stuff you freaking guys do all the time.
I mean, that's the kind of money that certain people take very, very seriously.
I mean, that's the kind of party you dream about your whole life
I mean, that's the least you can do.
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do. That's what l would do.
I mean, that's the only reason I took off.
I mean, that's the only thing I can think of.
I mean, that's the point of the project. They know that.
I mean, that's the problem,
I mean, that's the reason I'm here, right?
I mean, that's the role we play
I mean, that's the shadow! You're a pretty smart guy.
I mean, that's the symbol of a healthy, healthy reef.
I mean, that's the thing, right? it's - it's the eating people.
I mean, that's the thing, though. I mean, if you somehow could find a way
I mean, that's the type of shit you headshrinkers Ke, right?
I mean, that's the type of shit you headshrinkers like, right?
I mean, that's the type of shit you headshrinkers like, right?
I mean, that's the way I like to work. Finding my way as I go along.
I mean, that's the way the jury's gonna see it.
I mean, that's the whole point of a surprise party.
I mean, that's the word for it - absolutely forlorn.
I mean, that's the world I one day wanna live in.
I mean, that's the world I one day wanna live in.
I mean, that's the worst they got.
I mean, that's their thing.
