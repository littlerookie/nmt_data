he didn't. It was a mistake.
suffice to say that it never actually happened.
uh, no. You can't do that.
well, I have to. - I am your sister.
and I have told you...
every excruciating detail of my failed marriage.
there's nothing that you can... - He was a traitor.
the people that he was working with,
they still don't even know who they were.
but whoever they were, he was bad.
and whatever was between us was a lie,
so that he could gain my trust,
so that I didn't see him for what he was.
God, Liv...
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
me too.
and I thought Greg was a jerk.
uh, Greg is a jerk.
Yeah. Greg is a jerk.
Hello?
where?
flight 718 went down a little after 6: 00 pm.
witnesses say the plane just fell out of the sky.
once we recover the black box, we'll know more.
so why are we here?
shouldn't NTSB be taking point?
according to Air Traffic Control,
they got a distress call from the pilot,
but it was cut off and they lost communication.
whatever happened up there, I'm guessing...
... has something to do with what I'm about to show you.
it's burned badly.
forensics thought it was an animal at first.
they were mistaken.
no one's ever seen an animal like this.
I can understand the confusion.
this creature has...
pelage characteristic of an animal.
and yet...
Mm.
I will say this...
our friend here didn't start out this way.
Hey, Liv.
Hey.
Hey.
copies of the manifest passports.
147 passengers.
it's going to be a long few days...
for the poor folks tasked with trying to identify the remains.
so is there anyone of any interest?
not at first glance, no.
does the elder bishop have any ideas about that?
not yet.
or if he does, he isn't saying.
so the official word right now is engine failure.
the pilot tried to bring it in for an emergency landing.
the way this thing works...
works... - What it does to you?
it's a horror show.
it's far worse than you can even imagine.
I'm telling you, this stuff...
it's a horror show, John.
what? You find something?
Yeah, I think this is our guy.
the fried dog man? - Yeah.
we need to pull everything we can find on him.
how can you know that?
call it my gut.
you're good.
I would expect whatever caused this mutation...
would've completely alter his internal organs.
though the kidneys appear normal.
it also gave him four extra nipples.
maybe he mutated into a opossum.
no, opossum's have 15 mammaries.
unlike most mammals, who have an even number of nipples.
hence, the one half rule regarding nipples.
the one half nipple rule?
you just had to ask, didn't you?
the typical number of young in a litter is usually equal to half the number of nipples on the animal.
the number of nipples being the maximum litter size.
humans, for example,
one child is the typical.
maximum, twins.
barring extraordinary cases.
in which case, numerous nipples would be warranted.
God, I hope I never have to hear him say the word "nipple" again.
evidence of an extradural hematoma.
possibly epistaxis.
meaning, he had a colossal nosebleed.
I know.
hm.
there's something hard inside here.
scalpel.
Forcep.
what is it? A tumor?
not unless a tumor is made of glass.
I need someone Overat Vertusair, right now.
Yes, this is about 718. What do you think?
look through all the internal reports on structural breakdown
here's everything we have on Marshall Bowman 42- year- old, worked at a credit cortier in Marseilles.
managed their corporate accounts.
has doctor Bishop been able to make a positive ID yet?
no, but we should contact the bank, and see what they can tell us about him. - Done.
last page has Bowman's clients from the U. S.
he outdid himself this time.
and he's gonna get impatient to sell it off.
so you have to get the money lined up fast.
what?
Olivia, you okay?
people, we got something.
Simmons, patch me in through public address.
Wilson sent over the black box recording, the last 60 seconds of the flight.
play it.
new York center, this is Vertusair 718 heavy.
we have a report that there...
tower to Vertusair 718, other aircraft calling, say again?
our purser's reporting a disturbance in the main cabin.
there seems...
it's trying to get in.
new York, we need an emergency land...
718... we have something on board...
it's already killed at least three
dear god, hold that back!
that's it... Tech is trying to recover more.
let's back to work, people.
Hm? - Come here a second.
see this guy?
Daniel Hicks, he owns an import export company
based in Chelsea.
he's the guy that Marshall Bowman was flying in to meet.
so we need to bring him in for questioning.
this your gut again?
what's going on, Liv?
okay, this is going to sound insane.
so let's just put it in the category of "crazy things happening in Walter Bishop's lab."
okay.
John Scott and I shared consciousness.
our minds were connected through a procedure before he died, and Some of his memories are still in my head.
his memories?
and sometimes I get flashes.
I see what he saw in the memory.
and in one of these flashes,
I saw him with Marshall Bowman and this guy Hicks.
I think they were all working together.
on what?
I don't know.
a weapons sale of some kind?
okay.
I'll bring him in.
that's it?
despite the thousand questions I have in my head right now,
I'm going to bite my tongue.
thank you.
Bishop's house of horrors.
Hey, how we doing?
good, we got the bloodwork back.
you were right, it is Marshall Bowman.
anything else?
Yeah, Walter seems to think he was dosed with some kind of designer virus.
so, it was intentional.
hard to say it was an accident, this stuff doesn't exist in nature.
and whoever did it, would have to have a deep understanding of cutting- edge genetics.
I mean, it completely rewrote Bowman's DNA.
even if the plane hadn't of crashed, he wouldn't have survived the transformation.
and...
there's something else.
and this falls under the heading of "what the hell"?
but we found something in his left hand.
here, I'll stream it to you.
it's a glass disk, about the size of a nickel.
I don't believe it.
we found a similar disk on the D. E. A. agent a few months back.
I thought you told me that Bowman was a banker.
now you're telling me he's some kind of agent?
uh, I don't know.
but Charlie is bringing in a guy who might be able to give us some answers.
tell us about your business, Mr. Hicks.
my business...
it's import and export.
but you know that already.
you just came from my office.
why don't you indulge us, Mr. Hicks?
what do you import and export?
furniture, mostly.
mostly French. 18th and 19th century.
look, I'd like to know what this is all about.
I run a clean business.
how do you know Marshall Bowman?
he's my banker, overseas.
why, has he gotten into some kind of trouble?
this is wonderful. Don't you agree?
it's just like a good detective movie.
Mr. Hicks, have you heard what happened on flight 718?
Yeah, that's the plane that crashed, right?
Mm-hmm.
this might be hardto recognize, but...
this is Marshall Bowman.
he was on board that plane.
I... I don't understand.
I believe you do, Mr. Hicks.
I believe you know how that happened.
I believe that you and Marshall Bowman conspired to distribute a deadly virus.
and this is the unintended result.
look...
I think you have mistaken for someone else.
your nose is bleeding.
can we have a box of tissues, please?
no.
no, tissue won't help.
find me some sedatives.
now!
I need help.
Ah!
Walter, what's happening?
I expect the same thing that happened
to that man in the airplane.
here.
I may be able to suspend the process.
No! Not yet.
not until he talks.
please!
you want help? I want answers.
we... must... Have... been... dosed.
I want to know the name. Who dosed you?
Ah!
Oh, I don't think that's working.
I checked the dhs database,
nothing came up on a "Conrad," first or last name,
when cross- referenced with a daniel hicks.
well, so far, there's no mention of a "Conrad" in John's old files, either.
hm.
why don't you let me take a turn?
thank you.
anything?
Yes.
as often is the case, has good news and bad news.
he is transforming,
but I placed him in a medically- induced coma， to slow the process. - Which is that? The good, or the bad?
huh? - Which is it?
the good news, or the bad news?
that's the bad news.
the good news, is that I've already synthesized
a preliminary sample of an antidote.
I'm testing it on tissue samples as we speak.
and... a watermelon.
as a control group.
and will it be ready in time?
that depends on your definition of time.
if you mean before he turns into a beast,
I wouldn't wager on it, no.
wonderful.
cut open his hand.
what?
I want to see if there's a disk in it.
like Bowman's.
I like cutting.
where did you get these?
one of them was in Bowman's palm.
the other one was on Hicks.
we've seen one of these before.
did the N. S.A Everdetermine what it was for?
a data storage device.
apparently used to transport information.
I want authorization to exhume John Scott's body.
I think he may have one of these on him, too.
I think he was working with Bowman and Hicks.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
well, then make it possible.
excuse me? - I know it's against protocol, but right now, - frankly, I don't give a damn. - Stop.
and if you don't want to ask Harris, then...
I said stop. - I'll go and ask him, myself.
I can't deliver John Scott's body.
and that other disk?
it didn't go to the N. S. A.
where did it go?
one of the advantages of being the defense department's biggest contractor
is the massive dynamic has money to develop technologies
generations beyond that of the US government.
so when we were unable to retrieve the information off the disks, I requested Nina's help.
but I suspect that you telling me this isn't the only reason that we're here.
agent Dunham.
miss Sharp.
for what it's worth, it was not my decision to keep this from you.
as you suspected,
we discovered a glass disk identical to the others embedded in agent Scott's hand.
while he may appear to be alive, I assure you he is not.
we've kept him in a suspended state of...
we believe that the information stored in the disks
self-destructs when the disk's host dies.
we attempted to utilize agent Scott's body...
his blood, his DNA... to try to retrieve the data.
the small amount of information we were able to gather
seems to implicate agent Scott
as part of a bio-terror cell.
there were also references to a Conrad.
we believe he's a scientist.
designing chemical and biological weapons for sale on the black market.
CIA has received scattered intel on him in the past
nothing concrete.
we don't even know his full name.
so a plane full of people are dead.
and our best lead is nothing?
a chemist, who's name we don't even know?
it gets worse.
three hours ago, French Intelligence related to D. C.
that an informant of theirs claims a major weapons sale
is about to go down in Chicago.
however, what the informant was unable to say
is exactly where, or when, the sale is going to take place.
what the informant did know is that the man behind the sale
is known as Conrad.
Hello?
I'm on my way back. Is Walter there?
Yeah, why?
I just got word that Conrad's planning on selling this virus.
what? When? - I don't know.
but if I'm right, and John was working with these guys,
then he has the answer in his memory.
which means that it's in mine.
you know how dangerous this is...
tell walter to prep the tank.
I'm going back in.
you are ok? - Yeah
be careful.
we're online.
all right.
can you hear me?
Yes.
you must listen to my voice at all times.
it is your connection, your lifeline.
understood? - Understood.
I am going to try and guide you through John scott's memory
in an attempt to take you back
to the place where he met our comatose friend, here.
now, picture yourself
at the top of a steep flight of stairs.
as you descend, step by step,
you'll become progressively more, and more relaxed.
now, here come the last five steps.
four...
three...
two...
one.
where are you?
I'm in a bedroom.
no, it's not a bedroom.
this is where we used to meet.
John and I.
Oh, man. This is crazy.
absolutely, this will never happen again. - No.
ask her what she sees.
what do you see?
me and John.
don't worry, he can't see you.
remember, you're observing a memory.
I'll be right back.
Hi, Liv.
Olivia, what's happening?
John's talking to me.
that's not possible, olivia.
he can't see you.
we'll try to take you elsewhere.
where John and his accomplices met.
don't move. - Liv, what's wrong?
stop.
don't. Don't move.
Olivia, focus on the sound of my voice.
I said stay there.
I miss you.
don't move.
I'm going to ask you a question, and you're going to give me the answer.
you were working with a man named Conrad.
he developed a biological weapon.
I want to know who he is, and who he's planning on selling it to.
Liv, put the gun...
stop lying to me, John.
I know that you're part of a terrorist cell.
we have your partner in custody.
he's dying. And Bowman is already dead.
they were infected with some kind of a virus.
Liv... - No!
what just happened?
I don't know.
we need to get her out, now.
we can't. It's too dangerous.
she's in deep rem.
we need to reconnect before we pull her out.
Olivia, can you hear me?
Olivia, can you hear...
I want answers, John.
there he is.
who?
he's a monster, Liv.
capable of creating horrible things.
weapons, which he does for no other reason than because he can.
cause he's curious.
then he sells them to the highest bidder.
that's him.
and that's me.
problem was, we were hunting a man none of us had ever seen before.
if I'd have known I had him in my sights,
I could've taken him out right then and there.
it was my most important mission.
and I failed.
I let that monster get away.
I didn't know it was him.
what mission?
who were you working for?
Bowman and Hicks...
the truth is, they were and they are...
government agents.
NSA, secret task force.
and so was I.
I don't believe you.
it's the truth, Liv.
no, not again.
if you want me to believe you, then you need to prove it to me.
I can't, Liv.
it was Black Ops, a deniable operation.
if we were to take out Conrad, there could be no record of our involvement.
that's why I could never tell you.
even though I wanted to.
if that's the truth, then help me.
tell me where the sale is going down.
what sale?
the virus.
we believe that Conrad's planning on selling it.
I don't know what's going on inside Conrad's organization anymore.
but Hicks would know.
you need to talk to Hicks.
he was privy to all that information.
he has it right in his hand. - John?
Liv, trust Hicks.
he can help you.
we have to pull her out. - John!
prepare 30 CC's of dextroamphetamine.
Oh, Peter. - You're okay.
you're going to be fine.
I understand.
thanks for checking.
my contact at NSA. Couldn't confirm a single thing that John said.
of course, John said they wouldn't be able to.
well, that's the perfect alibi.
one that you can't confirm.
uh, yeah.
how's it coming?
his cell sample's membranes still aren't absorbing the inhibitor.
we don't know if the antidote's working yet.
but it might.
we could try it and see.
you want to wake up Hicks?
even though he could transform just like Bowman did?
well, Conrad could be selling this virus as we speak.
and Hicks is the only one who can tell us how this is going to go down.
and you're willing to take John's word that you can trust Hicks?
it finally happened.
I'm now referring to a dead guy, who only exists in your mind. - Boy!
I need another bag of midazolam right away.
what if he's still lying to you?
have you considered that?
if Hicks and John are working with Conrad, that maybe John is using you to tip Conrad off?
maybe he wants to get you killed.
this is a bad idea, Olivia.
my mother always says
I stick my nose in places it does not belong.
I know we haven't known each other that long.
but you are one of the best judges of character I've ever met.
so, I guess the question is what's your instinct?
when you were with John, when you were looking in his eyes, was he for real?
prep Hicks.
ready or not, we're administering the antidote.
an experiment...
how exhilarating.
this is Agent Dunham.
I need to talk to Broyles.
sorry to wake you.
little worse than adrenaline.
except, perhaps, lice, which is a nightmare.
Mr. Hicks, try and breathe normally.
can you hear me?
this is an antidote.
while I can't guarantee that it'll actually work,
I do have a recorded IQ.
Really?
we know about the work you were doing with John Scott.
now we need your help.
for those of you not in the know, information has come to this agency about a weapons buy.
the goods?
the same virus responsible for Flight 718.
I know this label gets slapped on pretty much all we do, but preventing this transaction from taking place is our highest priority.
the prospective buyer of this weapon landed in the United States this morning.
0700 hours, O'hare airport.
and we were there.
that suspect is now in custody.
and no surprise to anyone, refuses to cooperate.
but we do have someone else in custody.
an informant with extensive information on the players we will be dealing with his name is Daniel Hicks.
and he has agreed to relay all necessary information to Agent Dunham using an encrypted and untraceable two-way radio, which we implanted earlier this afternoon.
agent Francis will coordinate surveillance.
the informant disclosed that the meet is scheduled for 1600 hours, at the Fairchild Hotel.
room 1021.
the seller, a man known as Conrad will not be there.
but his intermediaries will.
we have agents standing by to move in in corresponding rooms.
per regulations, no raid will be ordered until Agent Dunham has visual on the weapon.
when she does, she'll give the go signal.
that signal will be...
now we all look forward to seeing how she works that into conversation.
okay, people, let's get it done.
listen up.
spotted the seller.
the seller is making a phone call.
stand by.
you didn't have to come with me, you know.
shady deals with shady guys in shady hotels is my m. o.
and typically, if someone is going to kill you, it's a good idea to have an ally in the room.
I'm not scared.
being fearless doesn't mean you're being safe.
Astrid, how're we doing? - Hey.
Hicks is on board and ready to go.
I'm putting you on speaker.
so far so good, Olivia.
considering 3 cc's of adrenaline.140 over 90, not bad.
are they going to expect bona fides?
Hicks, tell me what I need to know.
well, they're going to be suspicious
why they've never seen you before.
you tell them you used to work with Anderson.
Anderson, okay. Got it, what else?
you tell them Ernesto flew in for the meeting。
but he got called back to the basement,
and he couldn't come.
what do you mean,"called back to the basement"?
just say it, he'll understand.
you're not messing with me, are you, Hicks?
you trusted John Scott, right?
then trust me.
he's on the move.
seller's heading inside.
that's him.
here we go.
you be careful.
you're Gavin. Susan.
I used to work with Anderson.
I was expecting someone else.
well, Ernesto flew in,
but he was called back to the basement,
so he couldn't make it.
Mm.
who's he?
who are they?
we'll sweep you and get to business.
good.
she's clean.
the money, please.
just a formality, I assure you.
it will only take a moment.
have we met before? You look familiar.
did you work with Anderson, too?
he's testing you.
you tell him
Peter met Anderson at new college at Oxford.
they met at Oxford. New college.
isn't that right?
what does it matter to you where I met anyone?
where did you meet? On campus?
I'm sorry, I have no idea where they actually met.
we met at the White Horse.
on wheatly road, you know it?
I don't recall.
you would. Thai food... it's fantastic.
that's where I met Anderson.
if you want to hear it, I could tell you what each of us was wearing.
where the hell did he come up with that?
I have no idea.
it's all here.
have a seat.
I have to admit...
I was skeptical that you'd come at all.
well, of course we came.
I thought it would be Paris all over again.
tell him that was because of
the French intelligence report, and he knows it.
that was because of the french intelligence report.
you know that.
true.
but this is a larger purchase.
Hello?
okay.
Conrad would like to see you.
when?
now.
he's on his way.
what's going on?
do they have the package?
why isn't she calling the raid?
because Conrad's coming.
so what?
so she doesn't want to scare him off.
she wants to get him.
she's waiting for Conrad.
we've included this with the purchase.
it's a reverse mutator. An antidote.
it would take you years to reverse engineer an antivirus.
it's why the purchase price is so high.
the formula in itself is deceiving in it's complexity
well, we shouldn't have a need for that.
it's only in case of accidental exposure.
which, I assure you, would be fatal.
now why wouldn't Ernesto call me back himself?
and tell me someone else was coming to meet?
uh- oh.
Oh, god.
get me a tranquilizer quickly.
it's happening to him.
Hicks is transforming.
well, how would I know?
I'm not Ernesto's mother.
at least tell me who he was meeting.
Agh.
eh.
Ah!
quickly! Quickly!
what the hell is going on?
I asked you...
a simple question.
who was Ernesto meeting?
I need a name.
somebody, anybody else in your operation.
Oh, no.
Oh, god. Hicks is out.
I'll ask you again...
who was your colleague meeting?
sir, should we move in?
okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.
that's enough. Now, just tell them!
tell them, I'm not getting greased over Ernesto's dirty little secret.
what secret is that?
shut your mouth! - Ernesto is sick.
he's... he's dying... sick, okay?
he just doesn't want anybody to know.
damnit, Liv. Give the signal.
what the hell is wrong with you, he asked you... - What the hell is wrong with me?
I got a gun in my face, for starters.
enough of you. Shut up!
get that gun out of my face right now.
who are these people?
according to them, Ernesto's sick.
it's true.
he found out the day before Christmas.
I spoke to Ernesto this morning.
he's fine.
kill them both right now.
put the gun down!
put the gun down!
hands on the table, Get down.
John Ccott says hi.
turns out, Conrad's a French citizen.
with at least half a dozen biological attacks.
and those are just the ones we know about.
he's been manufacturing biological weapons and distributing them on the black market for years.
and you caught him.
I would think you could at least let yourself crack a smile about that.
well, I didn't do it alone.
you know...
despite the successful outcome of this case,
John Scott's status remains the same.
as far as this department is concerned,
he's a traitor.
even if he was telling the truth.
there's no way to confirm it.
that's all right.
I know the truth.
and that's enough.
Hello?
anyone here?
agent Dunham?
where is everyone?
they took that gentleman that was here to the hospital, to recover.
so the antidote worked?
he started improving almost as soon as I administered it.
which is more than I can say for my own concoction.
any case, I was just about to read a bedtime sto... - Walter...
I was hoping you'd do me a favor.
even if you did go back in,
I'm dubious you'd even be able to find him.
what do you mean?
your brain wave patterns are returning to normal.
your mind is finally succeeding
purging itself of agent Scott.
even if you perfectly reconnect, it would be for seconds, minutes at best.
and then you would never see him again.
then we need to do this now.
it's beautiful out here, isn't it?
we caught him today.
Really?
I'm sorry that I doubted you.
I should've trusted you.
no, it wasn't your fault.
I always meant to tell you.
I guess I ran out of time.
there was one other thing.
I know we can't ever be together,
not really.
maybe I won't know the difference.
I love you, Liv.
Edina NEW YORK
Yeah, i can hear her crying.
try that little rock-twist thing i do.
that usually soothes her.
it worked?
look at that.
uh, sweetheart, i have to go.
Yeah.
give here a kiss for me, would you?
okay, bye.
hey there.
where you headed?
what you doing out here all by yourself?
what about your parents?
do they know you're out here?
no, sir.
what's your name, son?
why don't you hop in, teddy?
so you were running away?
Yeah.
well, i took off a few times when i was your age.
but i bet there's people out there worried, looking for you.
and you know what?
it doesn't matter what happened.
I'm sure as soon as they see you
Oh, my god!
Oh, god, if i wasn't looking at him myself, i wouldn't believe we caught one.
I always thought they were nut jobs.
the people who told those stories.
seeing is believing.
Where'd he pick him up?
just off of 940.
a quarter mile down the road from edina.
Teddy, i'm gonna take your picture.
can you put your juice down and sit up for me?
I think we should call the papers, johnny.
he's just a kid.
he's one of them.
I don't care how old he is, people have a right to know.
we're not calling anyone until this thing goes through proper channels.
how much you want to bet somebody in the proper channels leaks it to
I'm sorry.
Walter, come on. Let's go.
why do i have to go in there?
because we're out of milk.
and because you haven't left the house in over a week, and you can't just stay inside watching old movies all the time.
look at all those people, peter.
what if i get lost again?
what if he's in there?
he's not in there.
and i promise you i will never let you get kidnapped again.
okay?
no.
no.
I'm learning to appreciate cowardice.
the lion had a point.
the lion?
the cowardly lion.
but again, that was just a movie.
and there's no flying monkeys inside the grocery store.
misshapen and deformed.
it looked like a cousin of bigfoot.
that's clearly wrong.
this boy bears no resemblance at all to a sasquatch.
or a yeti, for that matter.
well, you don't
you don't believe in those creatures?
why shouldn't i?
just because no one has documented flying monkeys or talking lions yet hardly means they don't exist.
agent frug, my father's a bit of a shock-doc.
don't let him alarm you.
all of these reports were dismissed.
thee was no cooperation and no hard evidence.
but the vast majority of them occurred in the same area.
just outside edina.
that's where the boy was picked up, walking out of edina.
I guess that's where we start looking.
whatever these things are, it seems like they've managed to hide themselves for a while.
and from the looks of things, they'll do just about anything to keep it that way.
keep it in mind.
yes sir
Edina Population 1, 943
I don't think this is a good idea.
it's okay, we're just gonna ask a couple of questions.
there may be werewolves in these hills.
werewolves? --Mm
that trooper reported that the boy changed in front of his eyes.
so yes, i believe we may be looking for some kind of therianthrope.
it's greek.
refers to a creature that has a metamorphic ability to shift between being a man an a beast.
it's mythological, of course.
I saw one once when i was a young man studying in london.
I was under the influence of a fairly potent blend of hashish
guys, hang on a second.
do you hear that?
that buzz?
hard artichokes rarely keep norwegian elephants singapore sleep hey, what--what are you singing?
I have no idea.
it just popped into my head.
it must be that
that buzzing.
I--I can't stop it.
agent dunham?
sheriff velchik.
thank you for meeting us on such short notice.
Oh, of course.
I couldn't help but notice that you've gotten acquainted with the edina hum.
Yeah, what is that?
military base, about five miles down the road.
they have a bunch of big turbine generators that get pretty loud from time to time.
well, that's one mystery solved.
why don't we have some coffee. Maybe i can help you with the other.
so i take it you've heard about what happened last night to the three troopers in jonestown.
I understand that the perpetrators took a kid.
Yeah.
my god.
you've never seen anything like that before?
no.
I've never seen a photograph of...
one of them.
then you have heard the stories?
of course.
telling those stories is a bit of a local pastime.
you hear 'em all over this part of the state.
well, sheriff, this boy was picked up just outside of your town.
and the state police have 30 or 40 unconfirmed eyewitness reports.
Oh, yeah, we get our fair share of sightings, but i've never been able to confirm them.
nothing like this.
well, we'd like to see those reports.
of course. Anything i can do.
what is it?
it's nothing.
federal agents came into the diner.
they had a photograph of teddy.
and they're asking questions about the killings.
I told you that wasn't the answer!
what choice did we have?
well, what are we gonna do?
I don't know yet.
we didn't get anything from the autopsies.
looks like the troopers were killed with 12-gauge shotgun blasts.
but there's probably a shotgun in every house in this part of the state.
you make a good point.
you went through all the sheriff's reports?
Yeah, they've had similar sightings, but nothing conclusive.
though sheriff velchik did mention a military base down the road.
you floating another government conspiracy theory, mr bishop?
you know me, i never miss a chance for a good conspiracy theory.
okay, i'll look into it.
God, how far away is the hotel? I'm exhausted.
I don't know. It's only supposed to be a couple more miles.
though somebody's already decided to call it a night.
well, he's had a big day.
you got him out of the house he's working a case.
I understand why he's scared.
but it just doesn't seem like he's able to snap out of it this time.
it reminds me of how he was when we first got him out of st. Claire's.
I'm worried that he's starting to go backwards.
I think he's starting to appear no less normal than the rest of us.
I ran into a guy from high school this morning.
you should have seen the look in his eyes when i told him what i did.
like chicks with guns turned him on?
more like i was a freak.
like i had suddenly grown a third eye.
you ever get the feeling that doing this job just makes you less and less normal?
Absolutely.
are we there yet, peter?
Walter, get down!
you know when it's real ally pretty quiet in this area.
not much in the way of dead cops and feds being run off the road.
but you think you shot it?
maybe. I don't know.
but it was able to drive off.
yeah?
we'll be right there.
one of our agents just found an abandoned pickup truck on the side of the road about a mile from here.
back towards edina.
is that the vehicle?
I don't know.
it was heading straight for us.
no plates, no registration.
we have a forensic team on the way.
we should have them run the truck's vin number, see if you can track down an owner.
what? What is it?
the large blue.
isn't she magnificent!
I've never seen one this big on this continent.
look, olivia.
I know a certain lepidopterist who will be simply thrilled.
I have to get my kit from the car.
Peter, look.
it's blood.
agent frug, over here.
we got something.
careful, peter.
you said you shot at the creature, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
you sure you saw what you think you saw?
agent frug, what happened here is simple.
my son shot a beast.
we found a man.
obviously the creature transformed in the interim.
Peter, do you realize the significance of this?
we may have found a creature with metamorphic ability.
hard artichokes rarely keep norwegian elephants singapore sleep there was no i. D.
on the guy so we're gonna run some prints.
you had no choice.
first time i killed someone, the guy was a trained killer.
if i hadn't pulled the trigger, i'd be dead.
I still didn't sleep that night.
or the next.
I'm just saying the first time's rough.
take the ramp down to the left.
you're good. Just follow the mooing.
everyone okay there?
more or less. Thanks.
I got a call from our military liaison.
there's something to the rumors of military testing at edina.
turns out the army was there in the late '70s conducting a series of classified experiments.
anything to do with metamorphic ability?
not that i can tell.
the pentagon files have been almost entirely redacted.
I put a call into the d. O.D.
,but in the meantime i'm faxing what we have.
right down here.
just put it right here.
perfect.
Thanks, fellas.
agent farnsworth, help me with my kit.
I have to get to work, but there's a wonderful specimen in there for my favorite fan of four-winged fauna.
I think you'll be quite tickled.
Peter, look at this.
the military experiment they did in edina was called "project elephant.
Walter's song.
were you involved in any military testing in edina?
not that i recall.
I'm sure i'd remember something as exciting as human metamorphosis.
another one that won't unzip.
Walter, it's very sweet of you to remember how much i love butterflies, but you forgot how much i hate moths.
what have you done to it?
excuse me?
you saw it, peter.
it--it was an astounding creature!
nothing like this.
it's wing is deformed.
Walter, if that's your idea of a joke, it's really not very funny.
Oh, my.
you'll want to add some wild thyme to the jar, dear.
it's possible we could get the moth to transform back.
it really was the most beautiful butterfly.
I'll believe that when i see it.
Walter, i understand what you're saying about the moth and the man transforming in the same way, but i just don't understand how that could be possible.
it's likely that both developed the ability in response to the same experimental stimulus.
slide.
you mean the military testing.
exactly.
well, why would the military be testing a butterfly?
a butterfly has two stages of life.
it's one of the few creatures with a demonstrated ability to abruptly change its body structure.
that makes it a wonderful alpha test subject.
that's odd.
what?
there's no sign of histolysis or histogenesis.
nothing to suggest a metamorphic ability.
I just don't understand how he can possibly have transformed himself.
so we didn't get a match on the fingerprints, but we did get a hit with the truck's vin number.
it was registered to joe falls.
but the address on the registration was old.
the house had been torn down years ago.
but he was from edina?
Yeah.
Edina Population 1, 943
Joe falls? He worked at the mill.
still does odd jobs now and then.
you think that that thing that tried to run you off the road
you think that could be him?
it's possible.
there was no photograph on his file, so we haven't been able to make a positive i. D.
do you have any idea where he's been living recently?
the last i heard, he'd moved to the outskirts of town.
but i couldn't say where.
I mean, i'm happy to ask around for you.
we'd also like to have a look at the town records.
see if we can find a last known address or a photo so that we can i. D.
sure. I'll take you over to town hall.
did you finish the analysis on the blood sample from the moth?
Yes, i did. It had some sort of genetic disorder.
Ah, germline mutation. Just as i thought.
this man has the exact same disorder.
is that what you think let's them... Transform?
no, the mutation is what makes them deformed.
I have no idea what makes them transform.
Walter? - It's curious.
I have this strange feeling that i've seen this mutation before.
please, not that song again. It's giving me a headache.
Ah, yes...
hard artichokes rarely keep norwegian elephants singapore sleep the testing at edina-- project elephant.
I think that's where i've seen this mutation before.
maybe i did work on project elephant, like agent dunham said.
so why did i put them into a song?
wait a second.
Walter, what are the words again?
hard artichokes rarely keep norwegian elephants singapore sleep singapore sleep.
does "harkness" mean anything to you?
Harkness is a library at the law school.
the song is a mnemonic, yes?
you must have done it on purpose, walter.
Yes.
so what's at the law school library?
come along, astrid. Let's find out.
there's nothing in the housing records on a joe falls.
there's nothing in the tax records either.
in fact, the whole "f" section is gone.
anyone whose last name starts with "f.
you can't just walk in and check these records out.
no, but you can steal them.
let's check the federal records if you lived here, you must be on the census.
hark
this is it. I remember now.
Walter... What happened to you in edina?
you're like a different person since you got back.
I've always found work to be restorative.
when peter was sick, it was the only thing that kept me going.
amazing how it heals the soul.
Oh, look.
devil dogs. I loved these.
Walter, we can get you a fresh one.
Oh, my, oh...
they're deformed.
just like that man in the lab.
subject
I understand now.
there's nothing on joe falls in 1990. anything in 2000?
anything in there on the current population of edina?
uh, 1,943. it was on the sign. Why?
I don't know, there's just something strange about these census numbers.
between the years of 1990 and 2000, 17 people died, 47 people were born.
that's the only change in the population.
sheriff. Uh, some of your tax files are missing.
uh, all of the section "f. " including falls.
I may know who's responsible.
the local tax collector said that falls had moved out to the edge of town.
he's living in a trailer with his wife and his son.
how old is the boy?
he said he was seven or eight.
I've got an address if you want to meet me.
Yeah. That'd be great.
Thanks. We'll see you there.
they don't know anything.
there's nothing to worry about. It's going to be fine.
you're wrong, paul. They found out.
rose, i know you have a special interest in this, but they don't know anything.
they have a photograph. They have proof.
others have come before.
I'm gonna take care of this.
I'll make it all go away.
so the man and the moth didn't transform at all.
no, no. No, this is something else entirely.
in the late '70s, the army became obsessed with finding a new way to camouflage soldiers.
they started experimenting with electromagnetic pulses.
as their camouflage?
Oh, yes. The eye converts electromagnetic energy into something the brain can understand.
that's how vision works.
well, the army thought that if they could generate a massive electromagnetic pulse, then they could effectively scramble the optic nerve.
and at the right frequency, make the soldiers invisible to the naked eye.
and you consulted on this project?
briefly.
it was after i left that they realized that prolonged exposure to the pulse has a horrible side effect.
an incurable genetic disorder.
and this moth and that deformed man are the victims
or the children of the victims of that experiment.
so how does that explain their ability to change, walter?
here, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop here.
welcome
come. Come. Leave the lights on.
Walter, what are you doing?
what do you see?
I see the moth.
come here, please.
now what do you see?
a friend of mine once wrote that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
how is it doing that? - It isn't.
the man and the moth don't change at all.
what changes is our perception of them.
Walter-- walter, slow down.
you're saying that this electromagnetic pulse allows us to see these deformed people as if they were normal?
Yes. Somebody must have perfected the military's camouflage technology to hide the deformities that the first tests created.
so then so long as we stay within the range of the pulse...
then these poor souls appear totally normal.
so that's the edina hum.
that's the sound that the pulse makes.
Yes. Yes, i believe so.
Walter, do you know who could have perfected this technology?
no, no. It would be extremely difficult.
apart from cobb, no one else would have the expertise.
Cobb? Who's cobb?
edward cobb was the scientist who dreamed up project elephant.
he would be the only one with the imagination and the know-how.
listen, walter, i want you and astrid to head back home.
but-- but given my knowledge...
Walter, listen to me.
somebody obviously has a lot invested in keeping this thing a secret.
they've killed three people already-- they tried to kill us.
I don't want to have to worry about you.
Oh, well, that's-- that's very sweet of you, son.
I'll see you back at hom what did peter say?
he wants us to head into town to try and find the source of the electromagnetic pulse.
there's been too much bloodshed already.
it's just making things worse.
you got your boy back.
would you rather we'd let them keep him?
you're killing innocent people.
it's time to give this up. There are real consequences.
sure. There are real stakes here.
that's why you gotta let me do my job and keep this town safe.
and you think that killing those federal officers is the best way to put a stop to this?
it did the last time.
that federal marshal a few years ago
no one came looking for him, did they?
we've all got jobs to do, rose.
stick to the machine. That's your job.
Walter... What kind of device are we looking for?
any number of things could transmit the pulse.
a large capacitor bank.
some form of compression generator.
what about a satellite dish?
they have them all over town.
Oh, no. Those are for television, dear.
given how little there is to do here, i imagine they watch a lot of it.
what we're looking for is something that could relay the discharge from the microwave conversion of large energy pulses.
what about a-- a big antenna?
Yes, yes, that would do, i suppose.
something like that?
well done, astrid.
are you sure we should just knock on the door like this?
Joe " that was edward's daughter.
he used to carry her around the lab on his shoulders.
Oh, hello. Is your mother home?
no.
but your mother is rose?
and your grandfather, his name was edward cobb?
who are you?
I'm walter bishop.
your grandfather was a friend of mine.
may we come in?
look, look. That's edward cobb. And-- and that's rose.
do you have more recent pictures of your mother?
we don't own a camera.
no, of course.
cameras have no optic nerve.
the photos would only show their deformities.
you have to go. I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house.
quite right. But may i use your bathroom?
you know my mother will be home soon. You should go.
we will. First i'll go, and then we'll go.
but where's the bathroom?
down the hall, second door on the left.
thank you.
is that operation?
Oh, i loved this game.
Joe falls is in his 30s, so he's too young to be one of the soldiers they tested in that experiment.
Yeah, it would have had to have been his father.
I guess folks with that kind of deformity don't tend to leave home.
you still stuck on that census data?
there's just something weird about these numbers i went back 30 years, and it looks like the only time the population goes down is when somebody dies.
what about when people move?
no, that's just it. They don't.
nobody ever leaves this town.
are you saying that you think they're
that everyone in edina is one of them?
we'll take cover in the barn!
go! Go!
my turn.
I'm going for the wishbone.
Oh, my.
easy! Easy! It's just me.
drop the gun.
I said drop the gun.
go home, rose.
the original pulse deformed the whole town.
my father couldn't live with himself afterwards.
he couldn't leave all those people like that.
according to our files, your father resigned from his commission in 1979.
Yes. He came back to edina and worked tirelessly on his machine until he perfected it.
then he offered the inhabitants a choice.
a choice?
live as you are, deformed, but free to roam the world, or confine yourself to edina, where the pulse will allow you to hide in broad daylight.
and the people voted to stay.
they realized the pulse would allow them to look beyond the horror of their deformities and see each other for who they really were.
they chose the only normal life they could have.
and your father?
he chose to stay among you.
he chose because of you, didn't he, rose?
last time i saw you, you were a little girl.
a perfectly healthy little girl.
my mother and i, we lived in edina.
we were part of the experiment.
your father experimented on you?
no.
the army never told him they were expanding the scope of the test.
rose, i remember your father fondly.
he believed that invisibility would save lives.
and he finally solved the problem.
my father tried to create a good life for me here
for all of us-- and he succeeded.
Dr. Bishop? - You can't make this public, agent broyles.
we need to let them keep their secret.
Dr. Bishop, three state troopers were killed.
and those responsible were brought to justice.
but the rest of these people...
you have no idea what will happen to them.
Dr. Bishop-- - they will have no choice but to study these people.
to examine them, to test them, to humiliate them.
Dr. Bishop, did you find the machine?
the one that transforms them?
please, agent broyles.
these people have been harmed enough. We simply can't
Dr. Bishop...
I don't think you're understanding me.
if you didn't find the machine, there's nothing to report.
thank you.
remarkable...
how rose was willing to expose her secret to right a wrong.
how very brave of her.
you did something brave too.
the way you spoke up for those people
you didn't have to do that, walter.
I'm proud of you.
I'm glad you choose to see me the way you do.
very glad indeed.
police have no clues in this bizarre murder that occurred here tonight.
Hello, beautiful.
finally, where have you been?
did you get my message? - I did.
but you didn't call me back.
no, I thought i'd call you later.
how was the conference?
where were you last night, Bob?
where would i be? I was at home.
I was catching up with my sleep.
but I called.
you know I turned off the phone to get some sleep.
Hey, come on, now, you're starting to go down that road again.
before you know it, you'll be all upset.
I think this has more to do with the miles between us,
all that dreary weather you're having in portland.
you'll feel much better when you get back tomorrow.
Hey, we'll, uh, we'll do something nice.
in fact, we'll stay inn. I'll call first.
I'd like that, Bob.
listen, love, i'll call you when i get home tonight.
right now i've gotta go have dinner with these insufferable suits from Hong Kong.
I hope it won't be too awful.
you never can tell.
Bye.
you know what's funny...
before I came in here, I thought I was good-looking.
seriously, though, I can tell you're my type of girl.
how do you know?
I know these things.
Cheers, man.
I can tell you're my kind of girl.
Oh, Olivia. You have to hear how Neil and Helen met
this could be good for my sister.
we both single.
and we're in our authority, haven't met anyone.
we wanne to have kids.
then I heard about this programme called Two singles together.
two singles together was the answer for us.
I'm sorry, two
two singles together.
it's a matchmaking service.
not just a matchmaking service, Rachel.
a way of life.
two singles together?
uh, I have my own schedule,
works for me.
I have no interest in controlling Neil's, either.
I like vacations in the sun and...
and i like the snow.
doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of being in a relationship?
well, i'm
there are things we agree on, of course.
like, um...where to live.
the appropriate kindergarten.
friends we both enjoy.
which, incidentally, I want to make sure
Ella can attend Graham's birthday party.
Oh, I already responded on the class sign up.
and, uh, that was for Neil's rock climbing party for Graham.
my party for Graham is the following saturday.
we are doing science center.
excuse me for one minute.
Thanks, Olivia.
what?
Greg's filing for divorce.
Oh, Rach.
not now. not in front of them.
they'll make me join Two Singles together.
okey, where were we?
I'm sorry, i've just been called into work.
Oh, what kind of work do you do, Olivia?
victim's name was Bob Dunn, he was 33 years old.
his girlfriend.
got back from a business trip in Portland.
couldn't reach him.
she found him here.
we confirmed the trip, force entry.
no witnesses.
so this matched the victim that boston p. d.
found two nights ago at the pier?
the one that's been all over the news?
Yeah, they don't know what to make something of.
so now they have another one, now it's ours to mix up.
you know what this reminds me of, Peter?
Nope, but i'm gonna guess
it's something unbelievably disgusting.
shrimp cocktail.
you see, the shrimp must be deveined
by putting a shallow cut down the back
to expose the vein.
which, in fact, is not a vein at all,
but the crustaceans intestinal tract.
great, thanks for that.
that's another foodstuff I can cross off the menu for life.
Hey, are you okay? - Why?
well, you were awfully quiet on the car ride over here
and you just don't seem your normal, chipper self at a bloody, gruesome crime scene.
Oh, i'm sorry, i'm, um...
it's just home stuff.
well, I know from home stuff.
at leaving the guy unexpected in several spine.
this is fascinating.
these appear to be bite marks.
see how the flesh is ripped
and jagged markings.
canine or even ursine, but human.
you're suggesting that someone chewed his spine out?
yes... but with a jaw strength
well in excess of that of a normal human being.
great, well, maybe we're looking for Dracula.
finally, son, you're opening your mind to new possibilities.
but, no, there are no vampires, sadly.
but it'll be something exciting, i'm sure.
we have another monster on the loose?
uh, no, sir.
Walter says that the teeth marks are definitely human.
I can just about remember when a suspect being human
was a given, not an option.
Bob dunn's girlfriend said that he had a car, an AudI A-4.
it wasn't in the garage,
and we couldn't find it when we did a two-block sweep.
local p. d. is on it.
Yeah, we could get lucky.
maybe the killer took it.
and dr. bishop?
he's at the lab with both bodies, doing autopsies.
okay, well, let me know if you learn anything.
is there something else?
this may sound impolitic, sir,
but I was wondering
if you were satisfied with your divorce attorney.
I've heard you talking on the phone to your kids,
but never to your wife.
I was satisfied.
except for the bill.
I was wondering if I might be able to get the name and number.
it should be waiting in your in box.
thank you.
I hope things work out for your sister.
I pay attention too, agent dunham.
the c-1 cervical vertebra is connected to the c-2 cervical vertebra.
c-2 cervical vertebra is connected to the c-3
That--Walter. that's enough.
when you finally meet a nice girl,
I would avoid bringing her home
for as long as possible.
Walter, this is the lab work you requested on the victims.
excellent.
it may help us understand why their spinal columns
have been completely drained of spinal fluid.
the killer took the victims' spinal fluid?
why would they do that?
where would the fun be if we already knew all there is to know?
this is interesting.
traces of treponema pallidum.
that's the syphilis bacteria.
on the victim's neck and back.
most likely from the killer's saliva.
so the killer has syphilis.
seems so.
great, I should have wearn gloves.
and what's even more fascinating,
this particular strain of syphilis is extinct has been for decades.
well, how could the killer be exposed to an extinct strain of syphilis?
see, isn't this fun?
I appreciate the CDC's prompt response on this matter.
of course. I ran an index search.
a sample of that particular strain of syphilis was shipped out four weeks ago to a Lubov pharmaceuticals.
they have a local address on Brighton.
well, thank you, but a phone call would have sufficed.
actually, i'm not sure that it would have.
because their address is in a residential area.
I took the liberty of running the rest of Lubov's research requests over the past few years.
this isn't the first contagion they've ordered from us.
in fact, there have been quite a few.
we need to show this to the Broyles
any reputable scientist with the appropriate credentials can procure sample of bacteria and viruses for their research.
in addition to the extinct syphilis bacteria,
Lubov pharmaceuticals also procured
a sample of a substance called Rud-390.
which is...
a chemical compound used in the construction of bioweapons.
you're suggesting whoever's behind these killings
may also be planning a biological attack?
or has before.
Rud-390 was one of the components of the rapid skin growth toxin that killed agent Kent.
you're saying this is Z. F.T.?
Z. F.T.? What's that?
we believe Z. F.T. is a terrorist organization...
responsible for a number of bio attacks in the last year.
I see.
Why? what is their agenda?
that's what we wanna find out.
assemble an assault squad.
move on lubov.
Yes, sir.
federal agents. you're under arrest.
Dr. Nicholas boone.
advanced degrees in hematology and biochemistry.
founder of Lubov pharmaceuticals,
a multinational biotech firm
whose corporate offices turn out to be in a split level in Brighton.
now, we know that the strain of the syphilis That you orderd was found on his spine.
and you see this, they're human bite marks.
what is out there doing this?
what happened to these people?
how long have you been a follower of Z. F.T.?
that's right, Dr. Boone.
we know about Z. F.T.
what do you know?
enough to know that they're using the world
as a testing ground for experiments.
we want to know more about David robert jones,
about who funds Z. F.T. and why.
we want to know what we're dealing with.
I don't have to spell it out for you, Dr. Boone.
you talk to us, give us information.
help us with whatever's out there killing people.
it'll go better for you.
what is doing this?
what have you done?
someone was dosed.
with what?
dosed with what?!
I know a lot about the things you want.
and more.
and i'll answer your questions.
but you have to help me first.
help with what?
they have my wife.
I want you to get her back.
Z. F.T. has your wife?
agent Dunhum, hat counts with punishment is the ability to know whom to turn, and when.
you're telling me Z. F.T.'s coercing you to conduct these experiments by threatening to harm your wife.
why would they be punishing you?
because when i realized what my work was being used for,
I tried to get out.
I'll tell you everything you want to know.
but first, you have to get my wife back.
do you believe him?
I don't.
Boone's wife is a nurse.
I checked with her hospital,
and she hasn't been to work in three weeks.
proves nothing.
I'm inclined to agree with agent Francis.
everything we know about these guys
suggests that they're zealots.
why don't we go back in there,
ask them why the sudden change of heart?
we can't ask him a thing until we get his wife.
could be a trap.
could be the truth.
I'm sorry, but since I've been working in fringe division, 81 people have lost their lives.
and that's not including the 147 on flight 627.
now, in my entire career,
only nine people have died on cases that I worked.
this is the closest that we've ever come to getting traction and stopping these people.
getting a handle on Z. F. T.
Jones...
or more.
this guy could be our chance.
what is it?
the address Boone gave us,
where he says they're holding his wife.
it's a restaurant... in Chinatown.
doesn't exactly scream Z. F. T. hive of activity.
they've been tighted by Edison
Meaning?
they're burning five times more power a month
than they should making moo shoo pork.
they could be using the power for something else.
maybe to facilitate a laboratory?
this could be our chance to get to Z. F. T.
go get 'em.
I'll get a team together.
Peter and Walter Bishop.
we're here to catalog the chemical evidence.
Walter Bishop. Nice to meet you.
hello. oh, no, please sit down.
Bishop, Walter Bishop.
Walter, you don't have to shake everybody's hand.
he gets a little nervous around authority figures.
Oh, boy.
look at that.
benzyl alcohol.
colorless liquid used as a bacteriostatic
in solutions for injection,
topically as a local anesthetic.
what did this guy create?
but i used to rely on it use as mouthwash.
from what I've seen so far,
I am forming a hypothesis.
would you care to hear it?
well, I don't know.
would I ever be able to sleep at night again?
well, that depends.
depends on what?
on whether the light is on or not.
there's four exits.
risk and Walken, you take the rear.
Taub and Brown, you take the side.
Dunham and I are gonna be in the front with the rest of you.
and remember, this is a hostile situation
in a contained environment.
so retrieving the hostage unharmed is our top priority.
Yes, Ma'am
Dunham.
Greg wants full custody of Ella.
what?
another process server just came by.
Greg is claiming that I am an unfit parent.
that "the minor's mental and physical well-being "Would be best served under the sole custody of the petitioner.
he can't be serious.
I won't let that happen, Liv.
I will run if I have to.
I will take her and I will disappear,
I swear to god.
okay, Rachel, Rachel... just calm down.
you're not running anywhere, and you're not gonna lose Ella.
he's just doing this to hurt me.
okay, Rachel, listen to me.
now, this is just one of those things that you're gonna look back on
and you're gonna say, "I beat that too."
do you hear me?
I hear you.
okay. so, um, look,
let's talk when I get home.
I-I've got a...
I gotta go to a meeting.
okay.
we got that meeting.
get your ass on the floor!
Claire?
Claire!
Valerie Boone. ta zai nali?
nicholas Boone de ai ren. ta zai nali?
Shei?
your wife isn't there.
I know that.
I need to talk to agent Dunham.
Dunham.
I'm putting him on.
agent Dunham.
what the hell's going on?
there's a room in the back. Can you see it?
Yeah, we checked. She's not there.
I know, but what I need is.
okay, I'm here.
in front of you, you should see
a row of refrigeration units.
third from the right.
Yeah, I see it.
open it.
you know, I'm not gonna do a thing
until you tell me why we're here.
we're getting to that.
no, you tell me now.
inside that cooling unit
you'll find a contagion of five vials marked XT43.
the person who's out there killing
has been dosed with this.
I need it to make an antidote.
you lied to me?
no.
agent Dunham...
they didn't kidnap my wife.
they infected her.
it's she who's out there killing.
Valerie boone.
Valerie boone, you turn March into June.
okay, that's enough. you be on camera.
I always do this.
I have no interest in being on camera.
come on, you.
are we both in? okay, that's me.
us in the park!
you are so beautiful.
you are really warm.
you're burning up.
What--what's wrong?
you're my kind of guy.
I am sorry.
roxbury Massachusetts
Dunham.
Charlie is running the background check on the body he found in Mustang.
Peter said you had something that I shoud see.
we found this in Boone's house.
you wanna pay specific attention to the date.
whoever wore a lab coat and rubber gloves.
Valerie Boone.
Valerie Boone, you turn March into June.
okay, that's enough. you be on camera.
I always do this.
I have no interest in being on camera.
okay, we'll both-- all right.
us in the park!
where is... Okay.
look out. Okay.
there, okay, that's it.
no, no, no! that's not it.
there he goes.
Oh, my god, you look like you ran in the trash can.
that video was taken three weeks ago,
Dr. Boone.
can you explain why you are in the wheelchair today?
she needs to feed.
she can't control it.
I began to feed her my own spinal fluid.
the more i gave,
the more she craved, until...
I couldn't give anymore.
the contagion burns through her spinal fluid
faster than her body can replace it.
when she kills, it's simply to...
refuel.
I tried to synthesize the antidote on my own,
watching her suffer the effects of being infected.
but I couldn't do it.
not without a dose of the bacteria to work from.
for the rest of my life,
this chair will remind me of what i've done.
why would Z. F. T. want you to create something like this?
to create a human nightmare.
the syphilis was just a platform.
carrier for other attributes.
attributes that changed her.
for what purpose.
for the same reason they asked me to...
create the skin growth toxin...
to show off.
to who?
other scientists.
you mean nothing to them.
so how many vials were created?
just the ones that I took?
I made six, now accounted for,
but I can't guarantee they won't pick up where i left off.
if they did figure out how to make it,
could they weaponize this bacteria?
you really don't know who you're dealing with.
the answer for both of us is to let me make a cure.
now that you've recovered the dose samples,
I can make it.
my offer still stands.
I'll tell you everything I know when you find her.
if the cure works, we both win.
now i'll need access to a lab with a blood analyzer.
I'll also need a spectroscope and a centrifuge.
you might want to write this down.
that won't be a problem.
you really think it's a good idea to let him have free reign in Walter's believe-it-or-not emporium?
Oh, and this is something my son peter is working on.
I haven't got the faintest idea what it is.
your centrifuge is 20 years old.
Oh, 25.
it's an oldie, but a goody.
I also have a cow.
and, just for the record,
one mad scientist is my limit.
I think that having him help walter
is our best chance at saving lives.
Dunham.
it's Charlie.
we found bob dunn's car. - Where?
clear across town, in mission hill.
it's completely stripped.
quarter panels, radio, everything.
and gps?
no, it's gone.
I was hoping we might have been able
to track where he picked up boone's wife that night.
okay, thanks, Charlie.
uh, good news, Peter.
nicholas and I are in agreement about this penicillin.
Yes, we need to purify the mold, then ferment it.
to the highest possible concentration.
agent Farnsworth, we come to need a rat.
can you, uh, call me if something else turns up?
okay, bye.
great news. they made a breakthrough.
they're gonna fight the super syphilis with super penicillin.
syphilis was the platform.
if they can kill the syphilis, they can stop the contagion.
they did the same thing once against super pneumonia
right.
well, Charlie just found Dunn's car,
stripped in mission hill.
excellent. he check the gps?
stolen.
well, everything stolen is not necessarily lost.
meaning what?
meaning if there's a car found stripped in the greater boston area,
I can guarantee you my man Mako has his big toe in it.
Oh, you have a friend who runs a chop shop?
Yeah.
you make that sound so illegal.
Dunham.
let's just say the GPS is here...allegedly.
but it's useless because it's been wiped for resale.
hypothetically.
we're trying to track a killer, Mr. Mako.
Nah, it's just Mako. you know, like "cher."
theoretically, if the GPS is wiped,
then that would put you in a rough spot,
because you'd be hampering a federal investigation.
I'm trying to work with you here.
we need the GPS to find out where the victim was the night of his killing.
but you stole his car from his home in Brookline.
I didn't steal his car from Brookline.
Where'd you steal it from?
if I tell you where we boosted that car,
can we just say that this conversation never happened?
hypothetically?
sure.
route 18th, weymouth. By the water
fascinating.
105 degrees.
then the rat's successfully infected.
this strain of syphilis raises the body temperature
well above normal.
the cure is nearly complete.
once this penicillin concentrates,
we can test it on the rat.
where did you study, Nicholas?
at the curie institute in Paris.
kings college, Aberdeen, Scotland.
it's quite a fall.
it's an honor to have your intellect in my lab.
that's high praise.
because I know very well who you are.
well...
that makes one of us.
a little memory loss is often kind to the soul.
that a figure of speech?
or do you believe there is such a thing?
the soul.
there are days when I wish i did.
there are days when I wish i didn't.
I often wake up at night, frightened,
with the understanding that there are things
man shouldn't know.
that the scientific trespasses i've committed
will one day be judged.
belly and I would often debate this very thing.
william bell. you've heard of him?
of course.
founder of massive dynamic,
richest man in the world.
we used to share a lab.
quite a fall.
if indeed there is a soul,
we must consider then
that there is still time for redemption.
we're not being hauled off to be judged yet, Nicholas.
this must be where mako boosted the car.
all the shattered glass.
so we're thinking what?
Boone's wife kills this guy,
steals his car, and then drives it out here?
Yeah.
but what was she doing here?
and where did she go?
you know what I hate worst than the cold?
what?
not much.
oliva, think I know why she came out here.
okay. ready.
we are about to inject the infected rat
with an antidote.
should it prove effective,
it will no doubt work on humans as well.
Nicholas.
now we wait.
Ah! marvelous.
you can bring the body right this way, gentlemen.
we've been expecting you.
right ove there is fine.
may i offer you a peak freen?
a delicious vanilla wafer with raspberry center
and lemon cream.
he doesn't want a cookie, Walter.
Uh...apparently, you're wrong.
that's two more bodies.
one we found in the forest in Weymouth.
the other on the street in Roxbury.
where is she getting her victims?
you must have some idea where she'd go.
the person out there killing people is not thinking like my wife.
well, she wouldn't recognize me...
let alone find comfort in places she knows.
this one's been drinking.
he smells like a brewery.
Hey, Peter, will you turn out the lights?
Seriously?
Oh! all right, peter.
I ordered it on television.
it's an entry stamp.
he's got the same one. It's a place called Cabrin.
the industrial area is really happening in the underground club scene right now.
so she's going to the club to find these victims.
look, i need more time to make the cure.
please.
if you take her alive, I know I can save her.
I'll see what I can do.
Dunham, FBI, he's with me.
now you're my kind of guy.
what is that?
it's a hand-held thermal imaging radiometer.
it tells me if you're hot.
so...
so you're definitely hot.
but, I'm looking for someone with syphilis.
uh, okay.
I don't understand. something's wrong.
something's missing.
the rat's body has rejected the cure.
perhaps a protein incompatibility.
no, it's not that.
I know what's wrong.
the contagion required cerebral spinal fluid
as a catalyst.
and the cure must require some as well.
bond the cure to the contagion.
Yes, and the only spinal fluid we know for a fact
is compatible... is my own.
well, no, that's out of the question.
it's too dangerous.
if you lose more spinal fluid
it could cause a brain hemorrhage.
no, I was very careful
to monitor the amount of fluid I removed.
another 25 milliliters should be safe.
Walter...we can't.
we have no other choice!
Walter!
prep the table, Agent Farnsworth.
thank you.
anything?
no, not yet.
I got her.
she's near the back, near the bar.
Peter, I can't find her.
she was right there, but she's gone now.
okay...
alright keep looking.
I'm gonna check with Charlie.
Hey, charlie?
we had her, but we lost her.
you got the exit?
nobody is leaving yet.
she's still in there with you, Liv.
you prepare for the spinal fluid, agent Farnsworth.
come on up.
here we go. Gently.
Yes.
okay, gently, gently, gently.
all right?
Yes, thanks.
Charlie...
Yeah, Charlie, I think she's headed to you.
what's she wearing?
black dress and freakishly blue eyes.
on it.
Valerie Boone，are you Valerie Boone?
it's her. Take her down.
all right, we got her. clear the area.
I just got off the phone with Olivia.
good news, Dr. Boone. they have her.
Oh, excellent.
Dr. Boone? Walter.
get me a tpa injection.
you lied to me.
you let me take too much spinal fluid.
how far would you go
for someone you love?
how's she doing?
she's gonna be out for hours.
Where's the siren on this thing?
there.
is that why you wanted to drive?
everybody should get to do this at least once bare working on
that looks says more than just, "I wish I hadn't have let him drive.
I was just thinking about Nicholas Boone
and what he did for his wife.
what he is doing.
jeez, that kind of love.
Greg asked Rachel for a divorce,
and now he's fighting her for custody.
you know, I never liked that guy.
you've never met Greg.
Yeah, but I met your sister.
so I know she deserves better.
and I thought you were a card-carrying cynic.
I am, world class.
but there's an argument to be made that beneath every cynic,
there is a frustrated romantic.
Peter!
Peter My trigger
thank you.
I think she like you.
good. bring her in, strap her down.
Walter, what happened?
he had a stroke.
pulse is strong.
Yeah, so is she.
agent Farnsworth, 30ccs of the antidote, please.
Peter.
thank you.
you're welcome.
okay now what
now we wait.
Walter...
No! Let her!
is she...
seems to be working.
agent Farnsworth...
prepare a solution, 30 parts saline.
and some adrenaline
and perhaps a cup of coffee.
Walter.
hmm?
he's gone.
Dr. Boone asked me to give this to you personally,
agent Dunham.
what is it, Walter?
agent Dunham,
if you're watching this,
I suspect I didn't make it.
but you and I had a bargain,
and, uh, you held up your end.
now, I have made many mistakes in my life,
but in the end, I should at least
be a man of my word.
and I promised you answers.
with any luck, you will use them
to rectify some of my misdeeds.
now, in the time I worked with Z. F. T.
I never dealt with anyone of significant rank within the movement.
but I was able to gather some names,
including some I suspect you've already heard of.
Dunham.
Hey.
are you all right?
Yeah.
uh, Nicholas Boone talked.
he told us everything he knew about Z. F. T.
did he mention David Robert Jones?
no, he said he'd never heard of him.
but he did mention another name that we've heard before.
according to Boone,
the man who's funding Z. F. T....
is William Bell.
for those of you just joining us, what you're looking at is the work of Z.F.T.
a terrorist organization responsible for at least a half a dozen biological attacks over the last several months.
everything we know thus far can be found in your packets, including a copy of their manifesto, which elucidates their ideology and their methods:
destruction by the advancement of technology,
which in short boils down to the following:
attempting to provoke or prepare for a war.
war? With whom?
that's the question, isn't it?
new
what we do know is that these bizarre acts seem to be increasing in frequency and that their targets are unpredictable, and therefore unprotectable.
taxi. Taxi!
we've recently developed evidence which suggests Z.F.T. Is funded by an unlikely source and a name I'm sure you've all heard of.
william Bell, founder and chairman of Massive Dynamic.
wait. Wait. Hold the bus!
you go up park, right? Past Lenox Hill hospital?
Yeah, six stops away.
are you feeling okay? - Fine. Let's just go, please.
those of you assembled in this room now have a single, clear-cut goal
to provide actionable evidence establishing a link between William Bell and Z. F.T.
special agents Olivia Dunham and Charlie Francis will be assigning you to teams and coordinating the investigation.
all efforts and information go through them.
now let's go to work.
stop the bus. Stop the bus, please. I have to get off now.
ma'am, will you please sit down? I'm not allowed
please stop the bus. I have to get off now.
okay, okay.
open the door!
Oh, my god. Please, please help. Somebody.
Oh, my god. I can't breathe. Oh, my god.
lady, you okay?
find anything new and exciting in there, Walter?
well, you've read the manifesto about a dozen times cover to cover so just wondering.
I need to show you something, Peter.
what's going on?
I don't know. Show and tell, apparently.
what is this? I don't know what I'm looking at.
this typewriter's Belly's.
I remember the day he purchased it. It was raining.
do you understand what you're saying, Walter?
that William Bell doesn't just fund Z.F.T.
he wrote their manifesto, and is actual responsible for everything that's been happening?
absolutely not.
william Bell was many things.
he was ambitions. He was egotistical. He was temperamental.
but he wasn't a madman.
although the ideas in his manifesto are radical, he wouldn't do this
this--these horrendous things.
he would never do it.
there are references all throughout to the chapter of ethics.
but there is no such chapter.
it is missing.
and I believe that someone has removed it to suite their own evil purposes.
and I can prove it. - How?
get another copy of the book.
one with all the pages. - There is no other copy.
this is the only one. - I'll get it.
he wrote it here in--in this lab.
The--the--it could still be here somewhere--the original.
and what if you're wrong?
I'm not wrong. And when I find it, you will see.
it will absolve him, Peter.
Peter, it's Olivia.
so this is what I've got so far.
bus driver called 911, reported an agitated woman got off his bus.
moments later, she caught fire and exploded.
police combed the area.
they couldn't find any evidence of an accelerant or an incendiary device.
if there's something strange in your neighborhood...
who you gotta call?
so what do you make of this, Walter?
well, from what agent Francis described, it's possible we're dealing with a case of spontaneous human combustion.
thought that was just a myth.
Oh, myth is just an unverified fact.
maybe she was hit by a tiny meteor.
it's also possible.
until I get this body back to the lab, I won't be able to say anything with absolute certainty.
all right, I'll get the coroner to prep the bodies for transport.
bodies? Is there another somewhere?
you okay?
send her in.
I won't play coy, Phillip.
I understand the FBI has opened an investigation into Massive Dynamic as you can imagine, we spend a lot of money on counter-intelligence.
and any probe into our finances raises red flags.
so... what are you fishing for? Industrial espionage? Treaty violations?
we have evidence that indicates William Bell may be involved with several biological attacks perpetrated this past year.
but that's ridiculous.
perhaps.
but as long as you're here, if you have something to offer, now would be the time.
I'm not one of your street thugs that you can bully, Phillip.
and William Bell is not a terrorist.
I'd like to hear him tell me that himself.
I'm afraid that's not possible. He's traveling.
you're wasting your time.
william Bell is not the enemy.
is there something else?
matter is just energy waiting to happen.
the average adult at rest contains enough potential energy to explode with the force of five very large hydrogen bombs.
you know, theoretically, you're actually right?
my son finally agrees with me!
uh, agent Farnsworth, take a note of that.
unfortunately, we're just not very good at releasing it.
no. It needs a spark, of course--a trigger.
so what do you think would've released it in her?
some say a particle is to blame-- the appropriately named "pyroton.
maybe we could finally prove that it exists.
Peter! Fire up the electron microscope!
uh, about that, I might've taken that apart.
what on earth for?
I needed the parts. For a project I'm working on.
as I said, potential for destruction in each of us is infinite!
Yes, Jim, I understand. Right away.
I had you pegged as a creature of habit.
you changed your office. - Come again.
your desk. You moved it.
we know from the driver what stop she got on.
he's worked up an artist sketch rendering.
so we'll canvass the area, see if we can id her.
what about the other victim?
did the bus driver see her get on too?
were they not together?
I'm sorry. You mean one.
there was only one victim. - I'm confused.
Dunham?
where are we on this?
uh, the bus driver remembered what stop she, uh...
what stop she got on.
he gave us an artist sketch rendering.
we're gonna show it around and see if we can id her.
what the hell is going on here? - Sanford.
why is the entire 13th floor trying to link William Bell to biological terror attacks?
we have evidence that Bell might be implicated.
Yeah, I know what you have.
you have testimony from a dead man who himself was an admitted terrorist.
well, his testimony confirms what we've long suspected.
massive Dynamic may be involved or behind the events we've been witnessing.
william Bell and Massive Dynamic are the defense department's largest contractors.
these waters are much too deep for a fishing expedition.
are you seriously suggesting that we just ignore
I am telling you to drop this considering that you have nothing more than an unsubstantiated report from a hostile source. Clear?
are we really going to-- - No.
get more evidence.
you know, Walter, working with you, it's amazing the sort of things you get used to.
you're not the first person to tell me that.
looks like somebody could've flossed more.
okay. Let's just hope that she has her dental records on file.
file. Of course. My filing system.
perhaps that's where I hid the manifesto!
you mean like how you seal things in the walls of your old house or how you squirrel things away in random deposit boxes around the country?
I would hardly call that a "filing system.
I was prone to hide things because I was afraid that someone would unlock all my secrets.
I didn't realize that the someone would be me.
Where's my Geiger counter? I left it here.
you think a radiation detector's gonna help you find the manifesto?
no. But I find that the rhythmic ticking it emits helps me think.
Oh, Walter, Peter actually cannibalized that for his project too.
Oh, no, look, this has got to stop.
lab rule number one, do not borrow Walter's equipment without asking!
Walter, we found a match on the victim.
her name is Susan Pratt.
thank you. Well take it from here.
Susan Pratt. She's 29 years old. Single.
worked for a New York highway department.
tollbooth operator.
that's a lonely line of work.
doesn't look like she had much of a social life either.
she's definitely a table for one.
Hey, Liv.
you think there's something wrong with her?
what do you mean?
you know, good-looking woman in the prime of her life.
no evidence of a boyfriend.
or any friends for that matter.
just doesn't exactly strike me as being normal.
well, I guess that depends on what your definition of normal is.
Hey, Charlie, I think I found something.
she has a $30, 000 check from an Isaac Winters.
I found something too.
I think you should take a look at this.
what the hell happened to her?
Walter, I'm back.
did you get it?
no, I told you they don't have it.
has to be Frankenberry-- that's what I ate back then
iif I'm to remember where I hid the manuscript, it's simple sense memory, Peter.
but they don't have it.
for all we know, they don't even make it anymore.
I did, however, get you this.
all the artificial sugary sweetness a growing scientist needs.
Hello, agent Dunham!
let me guess, you're a cornflakes gal. Am I correct?
uh, yeah. Why not?
so we went to the victim's apartment and there appears to be evidence of other fires.
so the bus stop wasn't her first incident. - No.
Walter. Does that mean something to you?
it changes everything.
we can rule out spontaneous human combustion.
for one, I mean, that's strictly a one-off event as you can imagine.
so what does it rule in?
Pokinesis. - Stop. There's no time for jokes, Walter.
it's not even a real word. It was made up by Steven King.
you ever see firestarter with Drew Barrymore?
little girl who can start fires with her mind?
Mr. King coined the term, but the phenomenon existed long before that.
it's not that complicated, really.
it's merely a form of telekinesis.
the ability to move objects with the mind.
merely?
however, with pyrokinetics, they can excite objects at a molecular level.
well--well, look, think--think of--of--of each of these grains of cereal as a molecule.
uh, as the molecules start to vibrate more quickly, they generate heat.
energy.
until that energy must be released!
it's a fascinating demonstration, Walter.
but it still doesn't explain why it is that Susan Pratt blew up.
I suspect this was a newfound ability.
well, it--it--it takes training to generate a heat source outside of the body.
without proper control, the energy is turned inward.
you see? She had no other options.
so you think that she had a choice to either blow somebody else up or blow herself up.
Yes. But this poor woman had yet to master her ability.
which made her a powder keg.
emotional stress, agitation, any high anxiety would set her off.
so where does this ility come from?
is it that she was just born different or is it something that someone did to her?
that is the real question now, isn't it?
I'm not cleaning that up, by the way.
we got a hit from that check you found in Susan Pratt's apartment.
uh, it was cut from a law firm. Signed by Isaac Winters.
he has an office in Charlestown.
no movement.
why am I not surprised you brought one of those?
because you know me too well.
if we get caught, I don't know you at all.
looks like somebody left in a hurry.
you have four new messages.
Mr. Winters, this is Susan. Susan Pratt.
you told me to call you if anything odd started happening.
well, it did, after I took the tests.
please call me back.
I'm gonna call ERT, have them dust for prints.
Mr. Winters, it's Susan again.
you told me--you told me not to talk to anybody, but I'm scared.
what's happening to me?
evacuate the area now.
proceed to the nearest emergency shelter.
this is not a test.
you okay?
you sure you haven't had any LSD?
mescaline? Magic mushrooms?
it wasn't a drug trip, Walter.
well, visual hallucinations can be caused by a number of things.
could you look straight ahead, please?
sleep deprivation, a concussion, brain tumor.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Oh, I don't think so.
if you were actually going insane, you'd likely have no idea what's happening.
take it from me.
when did these episodes start? How did they feel?
first with Susan Pratt's body.
then it was in Broyles' office. The other on the street.
the same people, the me places, but bleak.
the, uh, the city was on fire.
fascinating. There's another possibility, but it's a bit complicated.
deja vu.
it wasn't ja vu, Walter. Not even close.
typical protracted deja vu. Prolonged.
you're familiar with the--the pliability of space-time, yes?
course. Who isn't?
one minute will explain.
most of us experience life as a-a linear progression just like this.
but this is an illusion because every day, life presents us with an array of choices.
as a result, life should look more like this.
and each choice... leads to a new path.
to go to work. To stay home.
and each choice we take creates a new reality.
do--do you understand?
Yes. But what does it have to do with deja vu?
deja vu is--is--is simply a-a momentary glimpse to the other side.
almost everyone experiences it.
we feel that we've been somewhere before because actually we have in another reality.
it's another path. The road not taken.
Walter, why me?
why am I seeing these visions?
I don't know.
Walter, what about William Bell's drug trials?
you said that it worked on perception. - Yes.
if it's true and I was part of the trials when I was a kid, is it possible that it's causing these visions?
I don't know.
but what I do know is that you are a committed investigator.
you're a perceptive agent.
if you are having these visions, whatever they are, there must be a reason. Trust me.
really, Walter, from a man who routinely sees little green men prancing through the lab with tam o'shanters on?
Hey, I think I understand something.
it's another victim who died the same way Susan Pratt did.
I checked it out and the guy who runs the web site lives in Malden.
Yes. - Uh, my name's Olivia Dunham.
I'm a special agent with the FBI.
we need to speak to Emmanuel Grayson.
may I see your credentials, please?
Mr. Grayson, you operate a web site called "Galaxy Truths
where you claim to uncover conspiracies perpetrated by foreign governments.
I don't claim. I accomplish.
unlike you two.
you're just pawns being used by the government. To spread their propaganda.
look, I can appreciate your opinion, Mr. Grayson.
I just wanted to ask you a few-- - No, no. Look. Look.
you're right, okay? She's a FED, but I'm not. I'm just like you.
I am a citizen in search of the truth. Give me the photo.
we downloaded this off of your web site.
it claims that this person was a victim of spontaneous human combustion.
now you gotta tell us, where did this one happen?
Budapest. Three weeks ago.
the victim was an American graduate student on holiday.
the Hungarian police say he was attacked and set on fire.
that's not the truth. - Why do you say that?
are you familiar with William Bell?
of course.
william Bell killed these people.
what do you mean?
william Bell's company Massive Dynamic is a cover for all manner of unethical behavior.
multi-national, outside the purview of government control.
he founded it to continue his experiments with impunity.
G them, secret drug trials.
this was one of his test subjects.
then why would William Bell have him killed?
well, he didn't. At least not intentionally.
you see, Bell is trying to activate his subjects to see which ones were successful.
some can handle the process. Others can't.
what process?
to create super soldiers.
super soldiers? - Yes.
like Khan Noonien Singh.
to defend us in a coming war.
what war? - I'm sorry.
the khan? - Yes.
as in the wrath of... - Yes.
let me guess.
this war, it's against...
the Romulans. Renegade Romulans from the future.
here to change the timeline.
the sworn enemy of the Federation.
for you civilians, that would be the United Federation of Planets.
Yes.
and you know all this because...
I am the son of Sarek.
which makes you Spock. - Yes.
well, Mr. Spock, thank you for your time.
we'll let you get back to the bridge now.
live long and prosper.
okay, yes, you were right. But see that?
I'm a big enough girl to admit when I'm wrong.
Oh, but I think we can prepare for that possibility. It shouldn't be a problem.
uh, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very sorry, would you mind holding for just a moment? Thanks.
hello. When?
well, no. Don't do that.
don't do anything until I get there.
sir, I'm so sorry. Something has just come up. If you'll excuse me. Yes. You too.
get me to the helicopter fast.
what if we're orverlooking something?
what if Emmanuel Grayson was right?
about which part? Being from planet Vulcan?
no. Forget that.
but some of what he said made sense.
we already know that William Bell conducted drug trials with experimental drugs.
cortexiphan for one.
do you have anything stronger for my coffee?
Yeah. Bottom drawer. The cabinet behind you.
and here I was halfway kidding.
what?
what your father said about me having these visions for a reason.
maybe there's a clue in them that I'm meant to find.
meaning what? - We have one victim. Susan Pratt.
but in my visions, there are always two bodies.
who are they? - I don't know. Unidentified.
but maybe if I could get back to that parallel universe as Walter describes,
I can id that second charred body.
maybe what's happening there could help us understand what's happening here.
happening where?
nowhere.
your new assignment.
always a pleasure seeing you, sir.
wait a sec. Harris. Can you stop?
you want me to submit for a psych exam?
that's right. I'm concerned for you. - Why?
I've read your briefs.
and I'd say your analysis borders on the paranoid.
besides which, your behavior's been noted as erratic and driven by emotion and not just by me.
that is not what this is about.
my colleagues need to trust me. They need to depend on me.
not wonder in the back of their minds whether or not I'm losing mine.
look, this job is intense.
this has got nothing to do with my ability to do my job.
this is about something else. This is about you and me. - This is exactly what I'm talking about because right now, you are acting emotionally.
Yes, you're right, I am.
you know, I've tried to move past our history.
I've tried to reason with you in the interest of a working relationship.
but you seem to get off on this.
so fine. I don't give a damn anymore.
but I am not going to let you undermine my ability to do my job.
you can color this any way you like, Dunham.
but I am still your superior officer and that evaluation is a direct order.
we need to get their statements...
you put a shoot to kill order out on the perps.
you understand me? Don't get close to them.
Charlie. - Yeah, what's up?
uh, I was wondering where we were on the Susan Pratt case.
we're at nowhere. Same place we were yesterday.
I'd like to look again.
you have half of Boston in quarantined lockdown and you're worried about a pair of charred twins?
twins?
sorry. Didn't see you.
we already ran Susan's bio.
we didn't find a sister. - I know.
now what makes you think-- - Look. You were right.
it says here that she had a twin sister who went missing 11 years ago.
maybe Susan ran away.
changed her identity.
she must've been running pretty hard.
where does Nancy live?
she's local. 934 Whittier.
Thanks, Charlie.
can I help you?
Nancy Lewis, my name is Ssaac Winters.
Nancy Lewis. FBI. We need to ask you some questions.
it's unlocked.
coffee's still hot.
uh, this is Dunham. I need immediate forensic dispatch to 934 Whittier.
apartment 210.
Dunham. Take a look at this.
this glass has been melted.
you think she's starting fires like her sister?
what is it?
I got an idea.
I got it.
please don't touch that window. We haven't pulled prints yet.
you're not gonna need to.
I think the protocols and the processing of evidence are pretty clear.
let me guess, you're new around here.
is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
just tell Mr. Protocol to let me do my job, please.
uh, it's okay. He's with me.
are you, uh, ever gonna tell me what it is that you are actually doing?
help me with this first. Hold the glass up here.
Gely.
you have any problem taking it apart?
Walter tried to take back the electron microscope.
but I convinced him that you needed it.
so what's going on?
Nancy Lewis was kidnapped.
and we're gonna figure out who did it.
I've seen this woman before.
why does she look so familiar?
maybe because you dissected her twin sister yesterday.
remember? Blond girl about 5'7." Really well done. Melted fillings.
Oh, right.
Astrid can you plug that in to the DVI input?
Yes.
okay. Here's the deal.
Walter, the project that I've been working on was for you.
for me? - It reconstructs audio.
I wanted you to be able to digitize some of those old water-damaged vinyl records you have.
I know how much the mean to you.
thank you, son.
you know, when he was five, he--he built me a popsicle napkin holder.
dreadful design. Utterly useless. - Thank you.
but this-- this is...
you're welcome.
anyway, the basic principles at work here are very simple.
you all know how a record player works, right?
Yeah. A needle goes over the grooves of the vinyl and the vibrations it picks up are amplified into sound.
exactly. So the principle is the same.
except for instead of a needle, I use the electron microscope to take a high resolution, digital image of the grooves on the surface of the record.
that image is then transferred into the computer, which translates it back into audio that we can hear.
you sound just like him.
I'm guessing that with the software modifications I gave you, we're gonna be able to do the same thing with this.
so you're saying that you can play back the glass somehow. - Yeah.
Walter says that these pyrotechnic abilities only occur during times of emotional stress.
I think that when our twin was kidnapped, the heat that she generated 'caused that window to liquefy slightly.
which means that any sound that was in this room at that time would've left microscopic impressions in the molten glass.
like the ooves on a record.
exactly right. Now if you'll please scan the glass.
okay. You're ready to go.
all right.
so it's transferring into the sound processor now.
let's see what we got.
that could've been one of my records.
it's okay. It's all right.
I-I already have a digital scan of the glass in here.
let's try that again, shall we?
just slow it down.
I don't understand. It should be working.
Yes. Yes.
now attenuate for ambient noise.
get out of here. Stay away.
what do you want?
please!
poor dear.
Peter, can you play it back from when he starts to talk?
Yeah. One sec.
okay, just there. Where he's dialing.
okay, can you make that clearer?
sure. Let me just isolate the sound.
are you thinking what I'm thinking?
my cell phone app can dial the number from the tones.
this is Harris.
you got it.
I got him, Charlie. He's headed west.
I'm right behind you.
Charlie, he's approaching a warehouse off Moore and Adams.
Roger that. We're turning onto Adams right now.
he used a remote to get in.
I guess we go with the old-fashioned way.
where are we?
no thermal activity yet.
her body temperature's normal. We'll know more soon.
he's losing patience. We need her active. Get it done.
Liv, I heard gunshots. You okay?
Charlie, we've got a man down.
Charlie, I've got her.
back northwest corner.
I'm Olivia. I am with the FBI. - Help me. Please.
don't worry. You're gonna be okay.
No!
Harris, open the door!
I can't breathe.
well, look at that.
good work, agent Dunham.
you managed to activate her before we could.
damn it, Harris, open the door. She needs help.
not if she can control it.
and if not, she'll explode and kill both of you. So one problem solves another.
I'm burning up! - You're gonna be okay.
just calm down. Just calm down. - I'm burning up.
okay.
Yeah, it's me. I need to speak to him.
hold on. I'm gonna get you out of here.
it worked. She's hot. We have an active. But she's a loss. She's highly unstable.
why is this happening to me? - They did something to you
maybe to both of us a long time ago when we were just kids.
and right now you're feeling the effects from that.
but you can control this, okay?
you can control this and I'm gonna help you.
I just need you to focus the heat away from us.
I can't. - Yes, you can. Just focus. Focus on anything.
just focus, Nancy. You can do this, Nancy.
I can't. - You can.
Yeah, I'll take care of it. There won't even be a trace.
I, uh, uh...
it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be okay.
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
okay. I think you got all of that, Walter.
I'm gonna use the bathroom. Be right back.
scuse me, could you keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't leave?
agent Dunham.
Where's peter?
Peter's in the bathroom.
what the hell did you people do to us?
you and William Bell, Walter.
what did you do to me?
Susapratt and Nancy Lewis are from Jacksonville, Florida.
just like Nick Lane, the guy that you conducted drug trials on when he was a kid.
the drug trials that you conducted on me.
they were Belly's. They're Belly's trials.
but you knew.
Walter, you were there and you knew.
we were trying to help.
we meant no harm. - No harm?
you were drugging children.
three-year-old children, Walter.
why did you do it?
we were trying to prepare you.
to make you capable. Able.
something terrible is coming. - What?
I don't know.
Walter, what did you do to us? - I don't know.
damn it, Walter, you do!
no, I don't. I don't.
I-I can't remember.
I'm sorry.
what just happened?
Nina. What is it?
these were all taken in the last 24 hours.
you know what happened the last time he appeared with this kind of frequency.
we need to talk.
Astrid, I found it.
the original manuscript with the extra pages.
I was right. Listen to this.
our children are our greatest resource.
we must nurture them and protect them.
we must prepare them so they can one day protect us.
you see, I was...
Hello, Walter.
hello.
it's time to go.
is it time?
I'll get my coat.
evening.
Olivia Denham
Charlie Francis, FBI
you had no choice.
whatever that thing was, it wasn't charlie.
you've been through quite an ordeal.
what's this? - Sam weiss.
the man who helped pull me through.
you can take the shoes off now, we're done.
I just got here. - Come back tomorrow.
by then I'll have found you the perfect bowling ball.
I was told that you could fix me.
take care, Agent Dunham.
we're closed.
I think I owe you a thank you.
I got my memories back from the accident,
so...
I figured i wouldn't be needing these.
who "s died?
you and your partner, charlie, were pretty close, huh?
Yeah.
I guess getting your memory back.
wasn't your only problem.
Oh, of course I have problems, but...
but I can handle it by myself.
sure you can.
you know, if you ask me, what you need right now, agent Dunham.
is something to help you
with everything you've been going through...
something to help you...
make sense of it all.
does it take effect by playing bowling?
well, what do you know? she makes a joke.
no, I got another project for you.
uh, yes, like bowling.
you're gonna think i'm full of it,
but here's the thing, Olivia,
whether you admit it or not,
your life is something of a nightmare.
I hope you don't have anything against the color red.
jeez, Greg. Carl's really pissed off at you.
what, uh-- what'd you do, man?
you better get in there. - I'm going.
Finally,you are coming. we've been waiting for you.
are you okay?
Greg, man.
you know how much trouble you caused me?
I am going to destroy you.
what the hell?
are you crazy?
you can bring that in here, please.
hang on.
Walter, what are you doing?
making my bed.
I've got a fireplace to keep me warm,
and if i get hungry in the middle of the night,
the kitchen is only 13 steps away from me.
thirteen is a prime number
and a sign of good fortune.
you know that you have a bedroom, right?
upstairs.
Oh, i know what you're thinking.
don't worry, son.
I promise to wear my shorts to bed
so that if you bring any young ladies home
there won't be any embarrassing moments.
knock, knock.
agent Farnsworth.
welcome to our new home.
thank you.
Oh. oh, housewarming.
I love presents.
Oh. Walter, come on.
italian ciabatta bread.
very impressive, Walter. - Yes!
it's for good luck.
I brought something for you too.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
agent Dunham sent this over.
a man kills his boss, he doesn't remember,
and then he has this really crazy thing with his eyes.
this says there's video surveillance.
I saw it.
whatever was happening to that man,
it wasn't normal.
do I eat it or keep it?
I suppose whichever you'd like.
pack a bag , Walter.
we're going to Seattle.
thank you.
there you go.
do you have a card?
in case we need a ride while we're in town.
thank you.
thanks for your coming .
we brought Mr. Leader here around 6: 00 last night.
we haven't managed to get anything out of him.
he hasn't been cooperative?
he hasn't been responsive.
we only just managed to wake him up.
wait.
he's been asleep for 16 hours?
like he was drugged.
the doctors only managed to wake him up a few minutes ago.
Peter, I don't want to go in there.
I'd rather stay out here.
sure.
can you tell us what happened, Mr. leader?
it doesn't make sense.
I remember driving to work after lunch,
pulling the car into the garage,
and then I was on the floor in Carl Langdon's office.
they were holding me down.
and there's nothing else that you remember from yesterday?
nothing unusual?
you're gonna think i'm crazy.
try me.
the office...
it was like the office
was infiltrated by these creatures.
and Carl, he was their leader.
he had horns...
like some demons.
I know it sounds crazy.
almost like i'm dreaming,
or like it was...
Mr. Leader?
Mr. Leader?
Walter.
what happened ?
Greg ! what's happening to him?
Greg!
Oh, my god ! Oh, my god!
no, Greg!
No! no!
that's odd.
warm.
he should be cooler by now.
the oven
Peter, I think we forgot to turn it off at home.
Walter, we've never even turned it on.
are you sure?
Walter, we never turned the oven on.
we did not leave the front door unlocked,
and the toaster is not gonna burn the house down.
what's going on with you, Walter?
you've been acting weird ever since we got here.
sorry, we're still waiting on the tox screen.
but the blood test report is, uh
severe thyroxine deficit,
curiously high levels of adrenal hormones.
how did you know that?
shock-induced achromotrichia,
hyperkeratotic skin lesions,
and clear signs of dehydration.
it seems that this man died of
of acute exhaustion.
that doesn't make any sense.
human beings can't die of-- - Not that we're aware of, no.
it has been documented in rats.
I need this body taken back to my lab.
your lab?
in Boston, Massachusetts.
Walter, whatever you need, I'm sure they have it here.
would you excuse me, doctor?
Peter, I-I need to go home.
I don't like it here. - Walter.
this city has a smell.
Walter. - It's wet!
it reminds me of St. Claire's,
the mental institution where I lived.
Peter, I want to go home.
you stay. Help Agent Dunham, but
okay.
we'll find someone to take you home.
thank you.
seems pretty harmless.
looks can be deceiving.
buddy, I've been with the bureau for three years.
flying your father home shouldn't be a problem.
right.
you'll want to keep his sudoku pad handy.
there's also a copy of Max Planck's book on entropy in his backpack.
that should keep him busy for a couple hours.
and whatever you do, under no circumstances let him drink.
bit of a tippler, huh?
no, at any given time, there's a good chance
there's about a half dozen psychotropic drugs in his system
so drinking-- it's not a good idea.
thank you, doctor.
you know, I really appreciate your cooperation.
Yeah, no problem.
do you have a business card?
so that I can send you a copy of the results.
uh, of course.
thank you.
No!
you can't put the body in feet first.
lunatics. Out, out.
you think he'll be all right?
Walter or Agent Cashner?
Greg used to call me every day after lunch.
when he didn't call, I knew something was wrong.
but there'd been no change in his behavior recently?
列5
he was a little more tired than usual,
but he'd been working a lot.
but no illnesses?
no hallucinations?
no, not at all.
I can't believe he's gone.
Mrs. Leader...
did your husband have any sleep issues?
these books guide to sleep disorders,
understanding sleep...
he used to sleepwalk.
sometimes he'd wake up in the kitchen
having cooked a whole meal.
was he ever violent?
no, never.
and he was cured.
he had seen a few specialists.
he hadn't had an episode in six months.
uh, we'll need the names of those doctors.
and did he by any chance keep a sleep journal?
Yeah. Would you like to see it?
Yes. Please.
just in time, dear.
help me with this infernal body bag.
this is Agent Cashner.
Walter, it's almost midnight.
Yes, I'll hold.
the ride back was invigorating.
the turbulence over Ohio
was like being in the belly of a seizing whale.
I screamed like a little girl.
I'm sure that went over well with the rest of the passengers.
no, it's Bishop.
B-i-s-h-o-p.
Yes, we got the body.
what's that about?
they detained our bags.
raw milk?
no, I'm pretty sure
Dr. Bishop wouldn't have packed a bottle of raw milk.
Yes, I understand it's against the law.
I'm a federal agent.
that's odd-- nine stitches...
Sugery.
there's no reason for an incision there.
Astricks,
my small bone saw, please.
Astrid.
yes?
Dr. Bishop, I'm sorry,
but, uh, those bags won't be available to us until morning.
that's okay.
in fact, you can assist us in removing his scalp.
once you get used to the smell, it's really quite something.
come on.
I didn't wake you up, did I?
what?
cute.
except in my case, I actually graduated.
I'm guessing, uh, you bought your clothes.
to impress the girls.
Yeah, more or less.
so what you got?
Greg Leader's sleep journal.
his wife was right.
for the last couple months, he's been averaging between eight and ten houurs of sleep every night.
then how can he die of exhaustion?
it gets weirder.
he was also using it as a dream diary.
guess what his nightmares were about.
demons?
Yeah. At least once a week.
then a couple months ago, all of a sudden, they stop.
so do you think this is some kind of extreme sleepwalking?
no, sleepwalkers don't generally get violent.
and unlike Greg Leader,
they don't remember their experiences.
where did you learn that? M. I.T?
as a kid, I used to get these terrible nightmares,
almost every night.
so I know a thing or two about dreaming.
I'm sorry. That must have been awful.
actually, it was one of the rare occasions in my childhood that Walter was helpful.
he taught me to condition myself.
every night before I went to sleep,
I had to say a mantra in my head.
please don't dream tonight. Please don't dream tonight.
please don't dream tonight.
did that work?
well, you can't stop yourself from dreaming,
but it did make it so that I didn't remember.
from the age of 8 to almost 19,
I don't remember a single dream.
no more nightmares.
there's been another incident.
the guy in the bike was died on impact,
must have drived for forty miles per hour.
she had a crash kill her too?
she died but wasn't by crash.
Ellen was calling to let me know
she was heading home from the office.
we were on the phone when she...
she said she saw a monster.
did did you see her white hair?
what happened to her?
hold it steady, agent Casper.
it's Cashner,
you do this kind of thing often?
brains? no.
although Walter gets particularly excited whenever when we do.
look at that.
would you call Peter?
a filament...
it's a microchip with a tiny filament.
Ugh. I'm out.
Hey, I've got Walter for you.
a filament? what kind of filament?
hold on a second, fellas. Mind if I take a look at her?
some kind of little computer chip
imbedded in his midbrain.
the thalamus?
Yes, that would make sense. well done, son.
hold up, Walter. agent Dunham.
excuse me.
what does that do-- the thalamus?
why is it relevant?
it's the part of the brain that regulates sleep.
what are you looking for?
this.
both of the victims has planted the microchip.
it's a bio-chip.
technically a brain-computer interface, or BCI.
this particular chip
has a transmitter, which makes it wireless.
so it can commit the brain to a remote computer?
that's right.
from what we can ascertain,
we think it works a lot like a pacemaker.
it monitors sleep cycles
and, when necessary, stimulates the thalamus,
which induces a deeper sleep state.
there is a researcher in Seattle
who has worked on several prototypes like it.
the man is a genius.
we've been tracking him for several years.
thank you.
I'll let the team know.
Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak?
I'm Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI.
we were wondering if you were familiar with Greg Leader
and Ellen Rosiello.
Yes, they're my patients.
what's this about?
both of them recently committed homicidal attacks to people.
and then died,
as a result of what appears to be extreme exhaustion.
Oh, god.
Dr. Nayak, we found a bio-chip
imbedded in Mr. Leader's brain.
you know-- - yes. yes, of course.
they both had them, they were part of a study.
so you've implanted those chips into other people?
it's a large-scale, clinical trial.
there are 60 in the control group
and 82 with the bio-chips.
we're gonna need their names,
all of them.
I've been working on this chip for years.
I've tested it extensively.
and there's no malfunction
that could have caused the kind of reaction we saw?
what if the chip shorted out?
even if it had, the chip should have remained benign.
why is this...?
wait here.
the main computer server.
it contained all my research-- the patients' files.
it's all gone.
the patients' files
are backed up on a remote server.
I'll give you the password.
Dr. Nayak.
my research assistant.
Zach, call the nurses.
we need the names of all the patients.
everyone they can remember.
sure. uh, I'll get right on it.
the password.
thank you.
Dr. Nayak, can you think of anyone
who would want to steal your data
or might want to sabotage you?
I don't know.
I suppose there are any number of companies.
the chip was valuable?
Oh, the initial testing has been remarkable.
it's cured sleepwalking, night terrors...
all major non-rem sleep disorders.
these people just wanted some rest,
and my chip was helping them.
it wouldn't make them hurt anyone,
and it certainly wouldn't kill them.
it just doesn't make any sense.
Dr. Nayak, do you have a business card?
just for our records.
I'll get you one.
well, the doctor is beside himself.
and aside from the obvious reason, which is money,
he can't think of any reason
why someone would want to steal his research.
I can.
the bio-chip plugs directly into the thalamus,
which not only regulates sleep,
it also works as a relay tower
to the cerebral cortex,
which also controls motor function.
mind control, Peter.
wouldn't be the first time someone's attempted it.
I told you about my workWith the MK-ultra project.
of course, at that time, we supposed we could do it
with LSD and hypnotic suggestion.
so it is possible?
theoretically, yes.
if I faxed you a schematic of the device's internal architecture.
could you test the chip you have?
Yes, but I'd need to replicate the chip's functionIn a neutral environment.
of course, if I had a live subject...
Walter, no.
no student volunteers.
good news-- the bags are back.
Walter. walter.
Walter, say it-- "no students.
all right, no students.
okay, well, get back to me as soon as you can.
so, uh, did you reach walter?
Yeah.
he thinks it could be mind control,
but modifying the bio-chips
would take a lot of trial and error.
so he thinks that
someone trying to perfect mind control
one patient at a time?
well, that would explain why the events
are seemingly without motive.
Yeah.
how's the patient roundup going?
Nayak could only list 26 patients.
so the local p. d. are taking them into his clinic
and removing their chips,
so to speak.
that still leaves, what?
50-odd patients.
listen...
Olivia, I think I understand
what it is that you're going through,
but that thing that you killed...
that wasn't charlie.
I know.
it's just, I
you know, my first week on the job,
I was on a sting operation.
these Irish thugs
were smuggling guns and cocaine.
and I had been a military prosecutor,
so i hadn't handled a gun
since basic training.
and suddenly,
I'm underground in this garage,
wearing a bulletproof vest
and wondering how the hell I got there.
so I did what any rookie would do,
and I started looking for an exit.
and then charlie walks over.
this man that I didn't know
this gruff guy.
he said...
you're gonna be fine.
and, um, I have to face it...
that he...
he's gone...
and that he's not coming back.
so i'm just gonna go
to nayak's clinic
and see if I can help the nurse
identify some other patients.
okay.
that was a double order on table nine, pop.
so what'd your friends think of my moussaka?
like they'd died and gone to heaven.
damn right.
do you really want to increase the dose?
Dr. bishop, i'm heading to the airport,
back to seattle.
would you say good-bye to agent farnsworth for me?
certainly.
Oh, before you go, could you do me a favor
and smell this?
it seems my olfactory sense is a bit muddled.
must be the french roast coffee i had for breakfast.
raspberry?
keep Miss barage sedated for another ten minutes.
then bring in my next patient.
we should contact the local pharmacies too.
they should be able to identify
who's filled a prescription within the last six months from Dr. Nayak.
excuse me. hello?
what's shakin', bacon?
Oh, the usual--i'm just painting my toenails
and planning on taking a trip up the coast.
you get the business cards?
uh, yeah.
I got, uh-- I got eight of them.
eight? you asked everyone you saw wearing red?
Yeah.
so what do i do now?
lay them out in front of you like you're playing go fish.
take a pen, circle one letter in every name, both frist and last
when you're finished,
take all the letters you've circled
and write them down on a piece of paper.
got it?
okay.
now what?
now jumble.
jumble?
jumble, anagram, word puzzle.
find the phrase.
what phrase?
what am I looking for?
whatever it is you need to hear.
you'll figure it out. I got to go.
you know, I really don't have any time for this.
Dunham.
agent broyles?
nayak's patient files are gone.
the server at the data-storage facility
was wiped some time within the last 24 hours.
can we trace the hacker's I. P address?
we don't think there was one.
there's no sign of external attack,
and given the level of online security in the facility,
we think whoever wiped the files must have had a password.
so it was someone in the clinic?
it would seem that way.
it's not possible.
my employees are good people.
they've all worked here for years.
we're a family.
but they all had the password?
there was no reason for them not to.
I'm telling you
none of them would have done this.
agent dunham.
another one.
her eyes were going crazy.
her hair turned white, then she collapsed.
I don't understand.
she screamed we were cannibals
and then attacked me with a knife.
I had to wrestle it away from her.
she was so happy ago.
this doesn't make sense.
leanne suffered from night terrors.
she was just in my office last week.
we're gonna have to make a public announcement.
I'm gonna get our media liaison
to put an announcement on the local news.
Zach miller, my lab assistant...
skipped work today.
he hasn't been answering his phone.
Zach miller? FBI.
Olivia.
I guess that's why he doesn't answer the phone.
Walter, what's wrong with agent cashner?
I drugged him.
you drugged him?
Walter...
don't tell me you put that chip in his head.
no, but I wanted to.
then I realized that i could attach the chip
to an E. E.G. net,
and the signal would reach his brain.
and how are you going to send him commands?
I have wired the neurostimulator
to the same frequency.
if peter's theory is correct
and this is mind control,
then the chip should receive commands from the neurostimulator
which would be translated
into impulses that agent cashner's brain can understand.
I need help putting this on.
Walter, I do not think this is a very good idea.
don't be such a grinch.
I've told you, science should be fun.
come on.
look at his feet.
feet. got it.
anything?
Nope.
Walter, what is it?
either a green unicorn just raced across the lab,
or I accidentally took some lsd.
Oh, it must be mescaline.
it's peaking too quickly.
Oh. oh, god.
that's not mescaline.
it's something else entirely.
I think it's not the drugs at all.
I think I have an idea what it is.
and you've never gotten anything like this before?
no, of course not.
okay, i'm gonna send a copy of this
to our question documents unit.
they'll analyze the handwriting,
the paper, and the ink.
but in the meantime, the police have offered to
put a protective detail outside your clinic,
and detective green will watch your house.
now, if you'll excuse us,
we're gonna try and track down the rest of your patients.
don't worry, Dr. nayak.
we're gonna catch this guy.
then you can get back to your work.
we'll call you as soon as we know something.
I told them.
I showed them your damn note.
so you might as well stop.
so it's not mind control?
no, peter, your theory is wrong.
Dr. Nayak's chips aren't receiving commands.
they're transmitting massive amounts of data.
Walter, the bio-chips are supposed to transmit data.
that's their function, to monitor sleep cycles.
the chips aren't simply monitoring sleep.
they're accessing all the sensory information that passes through the thalamus
every color, sound,
and picture while we sleep.
Walter, are you saying that dr. Nayak's bio-chips
are stealing dreams?
that's right, dear.
leader's sleep journal.
he slept for hours, but he never had any dreams.
before they reached his consciousness,
they were all siphoned off,
which means no dreams.
the brain can never recharge, and that...
would lead to death by exhaustion.
exactly.
what's more,
I believe the chips have the ability to turn on a dreaming state while the patient is awake,
which would lead to paranoia, hallucinations,
and a complete inability
to differentiate between reality and dreams
the very behavior we've been witnessing.
Walter, why would anybody
want to access another person's dreams?
the rush, Peter.
think of your most pleasant dream,
multiply that feeling ten fold,
all mainlining through your cortex
in a few seconds.
it's really quite something.
Walter, are you saying that we're dealing with an addict?
not just an addict, dear.
a man who came in contact with this drug
in my estimation,
that man would become its slave.
we got to go back to the hotel.
what are you thinking?
Walter thinks we're looking for an addict, right?
well, my stepfather was an addict.
he was a drunk.
and it was like he had two different personalities
one when he was sober and one when he was smashed.
the deeper the addiction, the more extreme the rift,
like, uh, jekyll and hyde.
so this is the patient list that dr. Nayak wrote out,
and here is the death threat he received.
the handwriting's sloped.
these are written by the same person.
thank you, detective Green.
I told them.
I showed them your damn note.
so you might as well stop.
please.
water rudder set.
Thanks, hon.
Jack, what are you doing?
Jack.
Jack.
Jack, what are you doing?
Jack, we have got to get
this bird in the air.
Jack! Number 822, pilot in distress!
Jack!
Dr. Nayak.
Peter, he's plugged in.
let me try to shut down the program.
number 822 to atc,
I've got a problem!
I'm gonna have to try
to disable the server.
can you shut it down?
I think it's locked.
Jack!
number 822, squawking 7700!
okay, stand back.
Jack! jack!
Jack.
he's dead.
got a call from, uh, radio control at lake union
incident with a seaplane pilot, one of nayak's patients.
they're all safe.
good work.
I checked out Nayak's control panel.
all the dials were cranked up into the red.
you think he decided to go downIn one final blaze of glory?
actually, i think it was a lot more complicated than that.
you remember how horrified nayak wasWhen we told him his patients were dying?
I don't think that he was fully aware
of what his darker side was up to... until tonight.
so this was his way of trying to put a stop to things.
I guess that's the irony.
his addiction to dreams became his nightmare,
one that he couldn't wake up from.
maybe that was his only way of ending the nightmare.
dad, what's wrong?
what is it?
nothing.
you were talking in your sleep.
Yeah, I think I was having a bad dream.
I was a kid,
in my room.
you were there.
and the rest?
you don't remember it?
when objects from the other universe cross to our side, they have an energy.
a woman described it as a glimmer.
how can I see it?
the cortexiphan trials.
I was part of the trials when I was a kid.
it was a highly experimental drug.
it might enhance certain abilities in predisposed children.
I've never met anyone who can do the things that you do.
I'll go get my coat.
please don't tell him.
you sure you don't want some soup?
tea or coffee? to warm you up?
no, thank you.
I have trouble keeping anything down.
your office told me how busy you are.
I really appreciate you coming.
I'm sorry. I keep trying to remember you.
I understand.
it was a long time ago. We were just kids.
so is that when you think you were exposed to something?
I've seen about a half dozen doctors, specialists.
they think it's the only explanation that makes sense.
well, maybe I can help you.
look, I'm grateful you're doing this, but that's not why I asked to see you.
I wasn't looking to make money.
of course. I understand.
but if someone's responsible for your illness, my firm can absolutely help.
the last doctor I saw, he suggested that if I could find some of the other kids .
if some of them have the same symptoms, it might help him identify what it is that's making me sick.
I'm sorry.
I--I really don't remember names.
uh, it's so long ago.
you know what?
I do remember one boy.
um, Lloyd, um, Lloyd Becker.
he made me eat a bug on the playground.
I remember him.
sounds like a budding sociopath.
Yeah, right?
I really appreciate you helping me out.
Oh, and could you make an appointment with that oncologist over at Rhode Island general?
was IT GORSKI?
Dr. Gorlitsky?
Gorlitsky. That's right.
Gorlitsky. I'll call him right now. - All right, thanks.
I should be back in 20 minutes. Bye.
come on!
Hey, what's going on in there?
miss. You okay?
Hel--help me.
is THAT YOU, DUNHAM?
I thought you'd quit bowling, took up another sport.
it's been a while.
I see you're still not sleeping.
uh, not so much. No.
can you pass me a nut?
Yeah, sure.
which one?
dealer's choice.
perfect.
what's on your mind?
after my car accident, .
I would experience things.
I have.
you want a beer?
uh, it's 6: 30 in the morning.
when you've been up all night, time is just a matter of semantics.
no. thanks.
so I suppose you're here to find out what happens next.
suppose I am.
I can't tell ya.
you have officially gone beyond my field of expertise.
but I believe I can tell you why you're not sleeping.
and it has nothing to do with your accident.
you're a cop.
and you must make a dozen decisions a day, many of them life and death.
one of them you're not happy about.
you think you did the wrong thing.
I'm right, aren't I?
Yeah.
but it wasn't the job.
not exactly.
I agreed to keep a secret.
a secret.
okay, I'm on my way.
it's a good thing you didn't take the beer.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
you're a good person.
you know, one of the few I know.
if you agreed to keep this secret, I'm sure you had a good reason.
Yeah.
KILLINGTON? As in skiing? THEY JUST HAD A FRESH SNOWFALL.
I had no idea you were a skier.
Oh, yes.
I was quite a hotdogger.
I remember there was this secret trail.
they called it "the backside," but not for the reason you would think.
it was a nude ski run.
by the time you got down to the bottom, your testicles would be in your mouth.
I'm sure agent Dunham is very thankful for that image.
Walter's advocating a father-son trip.
and I'm sure agent Dunham is not interested in that.
I understand that agent Broyles has a body for us to look at.
her name is Miranda Greene.
30 Years old, unmarried. She was an attorney.
lived here in providence.
EMTs RESPONDED TO A 911 CALL Phoned in by a good samaritan.
she was dead by the time they arrived.
doctor.
this is agent Olivia Dunham, this is Peter Bishop, and Doctor Walter Bishop. John Potash.
I took your advanced biochem seminar, Dr. Bishop.
Oh. oh, I apologize.
I remember I was a bit of a slave driver.
you were. But also inspiring.
the truth is I was considering changing majors, but you encouraged me to stick with it and become a doctor.
I never thought I'd get a chance to thank you.
your father is a great man.
doctor, um, which one is Miranda Greene?
Ah, um, right this way.
I'm sorry. This might be a bit unpleasant.
epidermal blistering.
tissue necrosis. Symptomatic of cytotoxins.
could you get a sample of this pus please, Peter?
I always get the good jobs.
according to her coworkers, when she left for lunch, she was perfectly fine.
she hadn't mentioned any signs of illness.
that was about two hours before the 911 call.
uh, I was considering that these are contact burns from some sort of synthetic chemical.
no, these aren't chemical burns.
they look more like malignant tumors.
cancer?
Sarcomas, to be exact.
but that kind of cancer presents beneath the skin, not on the surface.
normally, yes.
do you have a black light?
Yeah. somewhere.
what is it, Walter?
I'm not sure. Cancers always start with a specific point of origin.
here you go.
agent Broyles, lights, please.
the cells near the point of origin of the cancer should show more progression, and hence refract a different color.
like that.
- Fingers.
huh. indeed.
right hand, I'd say.
which indicates not only what killed this woman, but also who.
of course, somehow we'll need to retrieve a print.
Bishop, what you're suggesting is impossible.
that someone touched this woman and gave her cancer?
it seems you've forgotten my very first lesson, doctor.
when you open your mind to the impossible, sometimes you find the truth.
uh, 28 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, And they're predicting snow next week.
hardly ideal beach weather.
why are you going to Atlantic city?
I was thinking of taking Peter there.
used to love saltwater taffy as a child.
so what are we looking for?
why are we cutting off this poor woman's arm?
the handprint shows an extraordinary level of cellular detail.
hopefully identify a fingerprint.
Oh, and I'll need two hot baths and an oven.
you really think someone may have touched her and given her cancer?
terrifying possibility, but a possibility nonetheless.
we need glycerin, corn starch, and food coloring.
food coloring?
well, not for her, but since we're baking, we may as well make some taffy.
I've WORKED WITH MIRANDA FOR ABOUT Seven years.
she was fairly private, but if she was sick, I think someone would know.
so what sort of cases did Miranda usually work on, Mr. Messing?
mostly toxic tort litigation.
Mm-hmm. Class action stuff.
asbestos, lead poisoning.
she had a real thing about protecting those who couldn't protect themselves.
and is this what she was working on?
Yeah.
she was preparing a case against Intrepus Pharmaceuticals.
trial was supposed to start next week.
hmm. How much money was at stake in the trial?
north eight figures.
wait, are you suggesting that-- that someone did this to her?
I thought she contracted some kind of crazy disease.
well, we're not sure, but we like to be thorough.
can we take her files on the Intrepus case?
uh, of course. Yeah.
miss Greene had a bunch of meetings scheduled for yesterday.
do you recognize any of those names?
first two are deposition prep.
I don't recognize the third one.
she was supposed to meet him about an hour before she died.
do you really think that Intrepus Pharmaceutical killed this woman?
maybe. you don't?
I've never heard of a drug that can cause what happened to Miranda Greene.
it just seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through to kill somebody.
why not just hire a hit man?
well, a hit man would draw too much attention.
and spontaneous, fatal tumor-growth wouldn't?
I suppose you have a point.
you want to come on inside, we can noodle on it? Maybe order a pizza?
uh, thanks, but, no.
I didn't get much sleep last night, so I should probably head home.
all right. Thank you.
Oh, agent Dunham.
you're up early.
Yeah.
I ran Neil Wilson's number.
it's a disposable cell phone, and it was deactivated yesterday.
it's a pretty common name.
I checked, and there's more than 50 Neil Wilsons in the Tri-State area.
do you want me to start running them down?
Oh, no. I'm pretty sure he gave her a fake name anyway.
Astrid, could you give Walter and I a minute?
sure.
Walter, don't mix up the spoons.
agent Dunham. Help me stir.
Walter, I have to tell him.
I got to tell Peter the truth.
but that's not what we discussed.
I know, and I'm sorry.
but he deserves to know the truth about who he is.
no. no, you don't understand.
things have never been better between us.
I can't lose him again. I can't.
you won't.
once he knows the whole story.
Walter, you saved his life. I'm sure that he will understand.
no, he won't.
he will never forgive me.
I--I have to tell him.
if it was the other way around, I would want him to tell me.
I'm begging you. Not yet. please.
give me time to prepare.
please.
Hey. I didn't realize you were coming.
I would have got you one too.
cappuccino. Two squirts of peppermint.
sounds like her meeting with Neil Wilson.
excellent. Well, I'm up for a road trip. How about you?
I remember her.
pretty lady.
comes in here all the time.
she's a lawyer, right? - yeah.
do you happen to remember if she was with anyone the last time that she was here?
some guy.
she was taking all sorts of notes.
what, does she sue doctors or something?
excuse me?
well, the guy she was with, he looked real pale and skinny.
dark circles under his eyes.
you think he was sick?
I'd say pretty bad.
looked my uncle did when he was fighting cancer.
you thinking what I'm thinking?
well, I'm thinking that cancer isn't contagious.
well, it wouldn't be the strangest thing we've seen.
but it would be close.
getting ready for a triathlon?
just trying to stay healthy.
you okay, sir?
you need me to call for some help?
no. no, I'm fine.
Yes, I'm an old friend of Mr. Becker's.
we went to school together.
I must have the wrong Lloyd Becker.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Walter, Miranda Greene had lunch with someone just before she died with--with a man that may have had cancer.
does that suggest anything to you?
cancer isn't contagious, of course.
that's what I said.
are you familiar with the Chinese notion of ch'i, agent Dunham?
no. - Dim mak.
the touch of death.
exactly.
the Chinese believe that all living creatures contain an energy, our ch'i, and, that with proper training, a simple touch can affect their ch'i.
reverse it can cause sickness, even death.
except, of course, they can't.
cause the touch of death is just a legend.
of course, what would be more interesting wouldn't be a transfer of energy, but an exchange.
meaning what?
this other man, you say that he was sick too, that he had cancer as well?
possibly.
and at the time she met him, Miss Greene was perfectly healthy.
then I suggest what we're looking at here adheres more closely to tantric sex.
sex? - Yes.
in so far as the goal of tantric sex is a heightened state of perception, of awareness.
the partners are not interested merely in the sexual experience.
they are seeking an exchange of energy.
okay, so what does this have to do with Miranda Greene?
for her health.
it's possible that the man that Miss Greene met did this to her as a way to delay the progression of his own disease.
Hi.
Oh, yeah, right. You're Alex.
thanks for seeing me.
of course. Yeah. How you doing?
come on in. - Thanks.
victim's NAME IS LLOYD BECKER.
30 a neighbor saw his door open.
she came in and discovered his body.
there's no sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle.
clusters of malignant sarcomas.
just like Miss Greene.
did anyone see the suspect?
police canvassed the building and the neighborhood.
no luck.
the malignancies appear to originate in this hand and then appear to spread out.
maybe from a handshake.
that's a fine deduction, Peter.
what do you see?
nothing.
nothing that tells me why Lloyd Becker was chosen as a victim.
there must be a connection.
Where's Walter?
he told Walter he could ride along.
what?
it's nothing.
I--I think I know what it is that's bothering you, why it is you've been so awkward around me for the last couple weeks.
okay.
that trip down to Jacksonville was crazy.
we were both exhausted. We were both emotional.
and, you know, if something had happened between the two of us,
I mean, if we had actually kissed, then we'd have to deal with that, but we didn't.
no. no, we didn't.
right.
you know, this past year, this is the longest I've ever stayed in one place.
so this thing that we have, you, me, Walter, this...
I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
I don't either.
okay, so we're good then, right?
Yeah.
good.
I found more victims.
five deaths over the past 20 months, from Chicago to Hartford.
each person died from the same kind of rapid onset cancer.
and healthy people keeling over like this didn't set off any alarm bells?
well, a couple were considered medical anomalies, and local police looked into another, but nothing suggested it was murder.
so what is it about these people that's making them targets?
Astrid, we need to cross-reference their files, see if we can find what they may have in common.
all right. I'm on it.
is his middle name Michael?
um, yeah.
Why? You know him?
how?
I don't know.
what's up, buttercup?
it's past midnight.
do you feel like playing a game?
clue?
Yeah.
I thought it might be up your alley.
Colonel Mustard with the revolver in the billiard room.
see, that's the third time that you've guessed the billiard room.
I've always wanted a billiard room.
I thought that you would make a better detective.
I detected that you needed company.
you've lived here a while, but you're still living out of boxes.
maybe you moved around a lot as a kid.
a tumultuous childhood.
a hard time forming relationships.
I may not be the gumshoe you are, but I've got some skills.
well, you're right about moving around a lot.
I was a military brat.
that would explain the uniform.
the uniform?
Yeah, bland clothes. I don't think I've ever seen you in a primary color.
it's because it's more than a job to you.
you're a soldier.
protector.
God, you'd be a blast at dinner parties.
I don't get invited to many.
no.
so what about you?
what made you the way you are?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm older than I look.
I barely remember my childhood.
I'm also taller than I appear.
that's it.
what?
what did I say?
uh, when we were in Jacksonville, there was a height chart on the wall with names.
first name and last initial.
all the kids that I was in daycare with.
Yeah, all the kids from Walter and Bell's cortexiphan trials.
so while I was there, I wrote down all their names and I made a list.
he was there.
we were both part of Walter's tests.
so that's where you remembered him from.
Uh-huh. Keep looking.
Miranda G. and Lloyd B.
they're all there.
all five of his victims.
so what does that mean? Why is this guy killing cortexiphan kids? I don't know.
I think we should wake up Walter.
that won't be necessary.
agent Dunham. Peter.
is it morning already?
Oh, no. No, no.
it's still the middle of the night.
Walter, what is that smell?
it's taffy.
I'm making it for Peter.
I think she was probably referring to your other project.
is that the killer's handprint?
I think we're close to getting a fingerprint.
the papillary ridges on the forefingers are quite clear now.
once it's cooled a little, I should be able to run it through the scanner.
well, whoever the killer is, he's started to target cortexiphan subjects.
are you sure?
Yeah.
Why? Why would he do that?
well, we were hoping you may have some idea.
I don't know.
but I have an idea why they might be susceptible.
to the cancer?
the energy exchange that this man is creating,
I don't think it would work on everyone.
cortexiphan was designed to--to allow children to access untapped parts of their brain, untapped energies.
so you're saying that whatever he's doing to his victims, like, exchanging his illness, it could only work on cortexiphan children.
Yes.
I think so.
so then I guess the question really is: How does he know about the cortexiphan trials?
and then how is he tracking those people down?
now, you've said that you and Bell never kept a list of the children that you experimented on.
I didn't.
and if Belly did, I never saw it.
okay, but what about Nina Sharp?
I mean, she started working with Bell around the same time.
Mm-mm. We asked. Last year.
when Harris was tracking down Nick Lane and Nancy Lewis, we asked her.
she doesn't have a list.
Yeah, but I believe that Nina Sharp isn't always so forthcoming.
why WOULD SOMEONE BE HUNTING CORTEXIPHAN Test subjects?
uh, I don't know.
Walter thinks that they could be particularly susceptible.
Ah. That's troubling.
did William Bell ever show you a list?
of cortexiphan subjects?
no.
and there's nothing in the Massive Dynamic archives?
as I've told you before, there's nothing on record.
do you doubt me, agent Dunham?
I don't know.
I've always been a little foggy as to your motives.
what are you implying?
well, you've kept information from me since I met you.
information that has prevented me from understanding the origin of many, if not all of the cases I've investigated while working with fringe division.
and I know about Peter.
I know the whole story.
does Peter know?
have you told him?
no.
but I'm going to.
no. You won't.
what makes you so sure about that?
because you haven't told him yet.
and I'm guessing you've had any number of opportunities.
well, I've had my reasons for waiting.
this is the right thing to do, and Peter needs to know the truth.
whether or not it's the right thing to do, I recognize the look in your eyes.
I know that working together closely with someone can bring about feelings.
I'm fairly certain that you're not prepared to lose him.
you didn't come here today to ask me about a list that you already knew I don't have.
and you didn't come here to announce that you're going to tell Peter who he really is.
to have me talk you out of it.
Mrs. lane?
Yes.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I--I tried calling.
my name is John Mchugh.
I went to school with your son, Nick.
uh, no, Nick is my nephew.
you--you look awful.
why don't you come inside?
thank you.
the red wire goes in the red hole.
the blue in-- - yes, thank you, Walter.
I was able to figure that out all by myself.
Hey. How'd it go?
uh, Nina didn't have anything.
how's it going here?
well, we'll soon see.
don't be so skeptical, Peter.
you liked the taffy, didn't you?
Absolutely.
I have my doubts.
ready?
what's it doing?
familiarizing itself with the genetic composition.
dismissing any foreign elements.
it's amazing how much filth we carry around on our hands.
go ahead, dear.
it worked.
of course it did.
okay, Astrid, we need to run this through the joint law enforcement database.
see if we can get a name for this guy.
well done, Walter.
thank you, son.
nothing.
he's not in our system. No priors, no arrest record.
we're nowhere.
you said you went to school with Nick.
a long time ago, back in Jacksonville.
we have a mutual friend, Lloyd Becker.
he said I could find Nick here.
I remember Lloyd.
Oh, such a sweet boy.
Nick lived here a while after his parents died.
several years ago.
do you--do you know how I could get in contact with him?
do you have his phone number?
I'm afraid not.
I haven't heard from him for some time.
it's funny, though.
someone else from Jacksonville came by, oh, six months ago asking for Nick.
she must have gone to school with you as well.
you don't by any chance remember her name, do you?
God, what am I missing?
Dunham? - I think I may have found our killer.
his name is James Heath, and he was a cortexiphan subject too.
I think that may be how he's doing this.
James Heath? Wasn't Heath the last name of the first.
Yep, of the first victim-- Julie Heath.
uh, she was his sister.
James was in the hospital.
she was visiting him, and she just suddenly collapsed and died.
he was, uh, he was having chemo treatment. He had cancer.
do you have the name of the hospital where Heath was treated?
uh, yeah.
it's Abington Memorial Hospital.
it's just outside Philadelphia.
I'll see if they have a current address for him.
Thanks.
you're Olivia Dunham.
you probably don't remember me.
my name is Nate Reed.
Nick Lane gave me your address?
you and I went to school together when we were kids.
back in Jacksonville.
I see.
what can I do for you?
I was hoping you'd have a few minutes to talk.
sure.
why don't you come in?
Hello? - Peter.
Peter, peter, it's me. He's in my house!
you stay down.
I didn't want this.
I didn't want to hurt anyone.
then why did you?
a man came to see me when I was in the hospital.
he said when I was a kid scientists had experimented on me, that because of the experiments, he could teach me how to fight the cancer.
but it didn't work.
I didn't get better. I got worse.
so what happened to your sister?
she stayed with me while I was in the hospital.
she never left my side.
and when the pain got bad, she'd hold my hand.
for hours.
and then, one day, it just happened.
I called the nurses for help, but it was too late.
I watched her die.
but you got better.
I had to find that man.
I thought someone from Jacksonville might know him.
and then I found Timothy.
and you killed him too.
not on purpose.
it just happened.
but that's when I realized how it worked.
if that man had never...
come to see me, I would have died the way I was supposed to, and my sister would still be alive.
they'd all still be alive.
in HERE.
it's okay.
how come you didn't call Broyles?
I've got you on speed dial.
Really?
I'm number one on Olivia Dunham's speed dial?
well, no, but I didn't think Iyer from the Indian takeout would be much use.
thank you for coming.
you're welcome.
Walter, I don't remember any of that.
I can't let peter die again.
what did you mean by that?
I designed a device Intended to cross the time-space continuum
and retrieve my dying son.
Walter, I gotta tell peter the truth.
things have never been better between us.
I can't lose him again. I can't!
give me time to prepare. Please.
any change?
excuse me, ma'am. Do you have any spare change?
thank you. God bless.
excuse me, sir. Do you have any spare change?
no. No, I'm sorry. - Anything you can manage, sir.
thank you.
God blesyou anyway, sir.
spare change?
Oh, god.
no, no, please! Let me outta here! Help! Let me outta here!
it's peter. Pick up.
Hey, walter. It's peter.
your son, peter.
come on, walter. Pick up the phone.
Walter, pick up the receiver,
and hit the square black button next to the red flashing light. You remember?
all right, fine.
when you get this, I want you to get your kit together.
I just got off the phone with olivia.
she said there was an incident on a train,
and I know how much you love trains.
thought it might cheer you up.
be home to pick you up in 15 minutes, All right?
have you noticed anything weird?
not yet, but give it ten minutes.
I was actually talking about walter.
hello. I'm dr. Walter bishop.
he's been avoiding me all week.
he didn't even look at me On the car ride over here.
he's stopped eating.
I got him a new box of peak freans. He hasn't even opened it.
well, did he say something?
no, all week it feels like he's been Enveloped in this...Sadness.
I haven't noticed anything.
Oh, my.
sir.
what are you doing?
I'm checking their underwear.
their underwear?
I'm sure you're familiar That with sudden death Victims often experience A sudden bladder release Of urine,
and sometimes excrement.
get off this train.
he's with me.
thank you.
I don't know what happened To these people, agent dunham.
my first guess Is collective heart failure.
you think these people died from having A heart attack at the same time?
perhaps it was sympathetic.
contagious, like yawning.
come on, walter. You really believe that?
Walter, does your theory suggest why all the lights Would be out in this car?
no, there should be battery backup.
unless it wasn't serviced properly.
agent dunham?
he crossed paths with the man As he entered the train car.
six foot, brown hair, Wearing a trench coat.
and he's sure that he saw him coming Out of this train car.
the man didn't speak to him Or acknowledge him.
he just exited down the stairs Of the platform.
did we pick him up on surveillance?
I'm waiting to get word If they can pull him on any footage.
agent dunham.
Hey, rod, Found this over there.
Oh, my god.
excuse me, gentlemen. That's mine.
thank you. Thank you.
all the batteries are dead. It's not just the lights That went out.
this is her cell phone, but they're all dead.
all the cell phones, laptops, mp3 players.
they're all completely drained of power.
any theories, dr. Bishop?
Oh, no.
except my initial theory of collective Heart failure is probably incorrect.
I'll need to take some Of these bodies back to the lab.
six or seven should suffice.
we have an image from the platform cameras.
who is this guy?
and how did he kill everything On this train?
this is unusual.
dying organisms struggle for their last breath,
but these people appear As if their switches have simply been turned off.
Hey, how's it coming in here?
Hi, peter. Not very good.
take samples of this man's lung, brain, and skin.
something's not right here.
Yup, I think it's my paycheck.
whatever it is, I'm sure You're gonna make sense out of it, walter.
what's going on with you?
is there something wrong? Something you wanna talk about?
no, everything's fine.
Astro, show me those previous Cellular samples, please.
that's extraordinary.
the atp concentrations are unusually low.
what do you say I take samples of the rest And see if there's a trend?
so what are you saying, walter?
that something was able to reach inside of these People's mitochondria and just
drain them, like the batteries In all of the electrical devices on the train.
what do you think could possibly do something like that?
I have no idea.
20 years ago a person walking Through boston for two hours showed up
on an average of ten different surveillance cameras.
now, it's hundreds.
bad for privacy, but good for us.
I've asked them to output each source To a different monitor.
give us a sense of the route our suspect took.
play it.
he exits the train station, Crossing ferris ave. , continuing north.
this is from the bank on howard street.
coming around the corner.
there, he enters a cafe.
he spent almost 45 minutes inside,
then left the establishment.
the guy kills a train full of people And then stops for a meal?
and the trail goes cold there.
once he left the cafe, We couldn't locate him on any other cameras.
but we have a place to start.
cafe wilusa.
Yeah, he was here this morning.
he comes in all the time.
weird guy.
weird how?
well, he always draws on stuff,
like the napkins and the placemats.
well, what sort of stuff does he draw?
some kind of math, I think.
to be honest, my higher math Ends at calculating my tip, so...
does he ever pay with a credit card?
sometimes he does.
here. This is him.
thank you. This will really help.
send the bishops up, please.
these mathematical formulae Are extraordinarily complex.
physicists use diagrams like these To shorthand ideas about how subatomic Particles behave.
these are sublime.
this may explain his flourish For numerical wallpapering.
astrophysics. He teaches at m. I.T.
if I comprehend this correctly,
then this alistair peck Has taken einstein's theory of relativity
and turned it on its ear.
I grasp portions of it, Tachyons are depicted here,
but I fail to see their relevance.
however, it does confirm That dr. Peck was dealing with Tremendous energy to do...
whatever it is he's doing.
what are you doing with my things?
peck is here, he's downstairs.
I guess that explains What all the surgical tools were for.
what did you do to the people on that train?
12 innocent people.
those people aren't dead, miss.
not permanently.
of course they're dead.
but they soon won't be.
although, others soon will be, I'm afraid.
Dr. Peck, I want you to lie down On the ground now.
don't take my computations. They're meaningless to you.
it is well within my ability To make it so that you are never in Possession of the things I require.
you've implanted a faraday mesh.
what are you talking about, walter?
a shield, to create a temporal pocket around your body.
of course. - of course, what?
why would he need a temporal pocket?
that's fantastic.
Dr. Peck, what are you doing?
Dr. Peck?
Walter, what's happening?
spare change?
I'm sorry you have to go through this again.
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
it's peter. Pick up.
your son, peter.
all right, fine. When you get this, I want you to get your kit together.
I just got off the phone with olivia.
she said there was an incident on a train,
and I know how much you love trains.
thought it might cheer you up. Be home to pick you up in 15 minutes, All right?
have you noticed anything weird?
not yet, but give it ten minutes.
I was actually talking about walter.
excuse me. I'm dr. Walter bishop. Is this the car?
must be the car.
Oh, my.
here's the initial report.
you think these people Died from having a heart attack at the same time?
perhaps it was sympathetic.
contagious, like yawning.
Walter, does your theory suggest why all the lights Would be out in this car?
no, there should be battery backup.
unless it wasn't serviced properly.
I'll need to take some of these bodies Back to the lab.
six or seven should suffice.
agent dunham?
he crossed paths with the suspect As he entered the train car.
says the man was in a raincoat.
six foot, brown hair.
says he touched the hand rail.
we're dusting for prints.
hi there.
uh, the man from the train
did he say something to you?
what did he say?
I'm sorry you have to go through this again.
again?
and what then?
he stepped off the stairs and walked away.
agent dunham, agent broyles.
all the batteries are dead.
all the cell phones, laptops
they're completely drained of power.
Hey, ron...
look, I found this on the floor over there.
Oh, my god.
Oh, thank you, thank you!
That-that-that's mine.
he found it on the floor up there.
Oh? Oh. Thank you.
the mitochondria were depleted?
Yup, completely drained.
the victims didn't die of a group heart attack,
they were just completely drained of biological energy.
just like their phone batteries.
pretty much. How is the question.
Walter's still working on it. I'll let you know If he finds out anything else.
okay.
Dunham... We managed to I. D.The print we lifted off the train car railing.
we got lucky.
they matched a set nasa has on file.
Dr. Alistair peck.
what did he do at nasa?
he was classified as part of a think tank.
we don't know much more than that, yet.
well, we know that he lives here.
412 inman street.
send the bishops up, please.
Mr. Peck may have done project work for nasa,
but he's employed locally.
astrophysics. He teaches at m. I.T.
what?
wow, I'm having deja vu.
Yeah, I read that deja vu is fate's way Of telling you that you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.
that's why you feel like you've been there before.
you are right in line with you're own destiny.
well, do you believe that?
Mm...No.
it's a bit mystical for my taste.
I never get them, myself.
maybe that's 'cause I'm not on track With my own destiny.
huh, look at this.
what is it?
a photo album.
okay.
but who are you?
what's your name?
well, one of them is bound to be back sooner or later.
hopefully sooner.
shall we go home now?
I'm tired of waiting.
Olivia...Might I come with you?
in your car?
I can't drive home with him.
I can't look at him.
Walter, you can't keep doing this.
Peter knows that something's upsetting you.
I've written him a letter.
instead of me stammering in fits and starts, A letter is more concise.
it explains everything in just the right words.
except that every time I think I'm ready to tell him,
I envision his reaction when he reads it
and I run the scene in my mind again and again.
and every time, the outcome is terrible.
but I will do it.
but first...
there's something I'm waiting for, agent dunham
something important.
Hey, guys, check this out.
templates. Forms.
what are they for?
well, they're what you'd use to cast machine parts,
but these look like they were handmade.
this one is dated several months ago,
this one even earlier.
he refers to them as prototypes.
but prototypes for what?
alistair peck was a professor here for six years.
his focus--obsession- was particle acceleration.
um, creating wormholes without a particle collider.
all right, you're saying that dr. Peck's Area of expertise was time travel?
he kept cranking out theories, and eventually Every one of them was over our heads.
that must have been frustrating For his superiors.
embarrassing is a better classification.
they wanted to fire alistair but he saved them The trouble and left, about a year ago.
is this his wife?
Ah, the fiancee.
her name is arlette.
do you remember her last name?
I don't recall, no.
do you know Any other friends he might have had?
people he knew?
that's the sad thing. He was kind to everyone, But he never socialized.
I think I was his only friend.
well, anything that you can remember About mr. Peck, it could be important.
alistair sent me these about six months ago To proofread.
he had hopes of seeing them published.
uh, can we take them?
they're only gathering dust here.
they are pretty dense.
most would say it's gobbledegook.
well, I happen to know Someone who's fluent in gobbledegook.
I'm finished.
in another 20 years, with the assistance Of some other great minds,
I will have absorbed this information.
alistair peck Has conceived of some extraordinary theories
and is possibly implementing them.
meaning what?
he may well be able to travel through time.
Conceivably.
einstein himself theorized this.
10: 00 a. M...11: 00 a. M.
he said that if something Could propel an object faster than the speed of light,
then time would appear to bend.
when those two folds connect,
a tremendous amount of energy is required To absorb the jump.
from any power source.
so the laptops, the phones
and anyone who was near him.
Yes.
then what you're saying, walter, is that
peck's moving through time is what killed All of these people on the train.
that is my theory, yes, and olivia, if it is right,
then we may well have apprehended this man already.
possibly several times.
I found his fiancee.
the car in one of the photo album pictures Is registered to an arlette turling.
her license information is coming through.
okay, that's her. Find out whatever you can.
she's our only connection to peck.
third volume is unfinished.
there's a handwritten segment at the back,
then the writing stops.
the unfinished chapter is entitled "achieving the arlette principle.
What'd you just say?
achieving the arlette principle.
I think I know why peck is doing this.
arlette turling was killed in a car accident Ten months ago.
on the 18th of may.
what if alistair peck is going back to save her?
grief can drive people to extraordinary lengths.
now, considering the amount of energy that was drawn
when he landed at the station this morning,
using peck's own theories,
I estimate that we witnessed just a 12-hour jump.
10-month jump...
the results would be devastating.
well, how many casualties?
it would depend where he landed.
hundreds.
this is weird.
I did a search for peck's cell phone When we first I. D. 'd him as a suspect.
he didn't have one,
but arlette turling's number is still active.
someone's paying the bill.
now, in the past 24 hours,
the primary cell tower that's been Handling the signal from arlette's cell phone
is a tower near albany street.
well, what's near albany street?
M. I.T.
well, what's he doing at m. I.T?
the professor said that she hadn't seen him For almost a year.
well, walter has a lab here,
maybe peck has a lab there.
according to the files,
the lab registered to peck when he was a professor here Was lab 107.
are there any windows in that lab?
get your men on the rooftops.
are those guns really necessary?
you okay? Want me to take you back home?
no, peter, no,
just stay there.
agent broyles... - Agent dunham.
if we are correct,
and, for peck, this is about Bringing a dead loved one back to life,
then peck and I, We have something in common.
let me speak to him.
Walter, I-- - Of course I know that killing him Is the only way to ensure
that he won't jump, but if I could Talk to him,
I think I can Convince him to stop this.
please.
let's talk to broyles.
wait.
I am not a threat.
I am an ambassador.
I know who you are.
you're dr. Walter bishop. I've read you.
new frontiers in genetic hybridization.
and I know that if you wanted to,
you could disappear from here in a second.
please, trust me.
we take for granted
the laws of nature for example
that are not necessarily binding.
there are places on this earth Where two plus two most definitely Does not equal four.
you've figured out how to bend time.
but you're only interested In traveling to the past.
your goal, your next jump Is the 18th of may.
so you know.
the 18th of may.
Yes.
don't do that! Don't stand there!
there are snipers outside. Stay away from the window!
I hope he knows what he's doing.
why are you here? What do you really want?
my calculations show What you must already know.
an enormous amount of energy will be drained From wherever you arrive
and a large number of people Will be killed.
but each jump back Clears that slate.
no.
if you are reunited with your fiancee And you pull her from that car,
the victims of this last Massive reset will remain dead.
listen.
on the day of the crash, We argued.
arlette wanted me to go to some store To register for wedding gifts,
and I hurt her feelings And I left.
as I walked, I became drawn to something On the horizon.
a large, red ball.
it was a hot air balloon.
moored on the city's outskirts, Out in this field.
I spent the whole day in this field, Looking at this balloon,
and I got my answer.
I had an epiphany of how to physically Apply my theories of time travel.
I was in that field the moment her car was hit.
18 may, 2: 18 p. M.
if I'd have simply done what she asked me,
if I'd have said, "sure, I'll go with you,
I know it wouldn't have happened.
I will jump back.
but I'll jump back Into that empty field, walter.
and I'll only drain the energy From the plant life.
energy will be dispersed, no one will die,
and I will pull arlette from that car And I will save her life.
I know why you haven't gone back To may 18th, yet.
because you don't know how to.
you haven't been able to jump back Any further than the train.
what happened?
someone get that signal back online!
you approximate the time curvature
using a seventh order polynomial.
but you made one small error.
for the distance you require,
it should be at least nine.
I've read you too.
get a team up there, now.
I'm telling you how to do this,
but I'm telling you you cannot do it.
I must do it.
you'll never be able to live with the consequences.
I told you, no one will die.
that's not the consequences I'm talking about.
I, too, attempted the unimaginable,
and I succeeded.
I crossed into another universe,
and took a son that wasn't mine.
and since then, not a day has passed Without me feeling the burden of that act.
I'm going to tell you something That I have never told another soul.
until I took my son from the other side,
I had never believed in god.
but it occurred to me...
that my actions had betrayed him
and that everything that had happened to me since Was god punishing me.
so now I'm looking for a sign of forgiveness.
I've asked god for a sign of forgiveness.
a specific one, a white tulip.
tulips don't bloom This time of year - white or otherwise.
but he's god.
and if god can forgive me for my acts
then maybe...
it's in the realm of possibility
that my son, possibly, May be able to forgive me too.
Walter, god is science.
God is polio and flu vaccines And m. R.I. Machines, and artificial hearts.
if you are a man of science,
then that's the only faith we need.
then allow me to serve as a precautionary tale.
there will be repercussions If you pull arlette from that car.
you don't know how things will be changed By your actions, but they will.
it's not our place to adjust the universe.
and you will never be able To look at her again without knowing that,
just like every time I look at my son.
I have traveled Through madness to figure this out.
and you will too.
you're asking me to just leave her there.
no, no, no! Stop! I'm all right.
stop! No, please! Gentlemen, please!
don't you see? We won't remember this.
don't you see? We won't remember anything.
we won't remember!
this is weird.
I did a search for peck's cell phone When we first I. D. 'd him as a suspect.
he didn't have one.
but arlette turling's number is still active.
now in the past 24 hours, the primary cell tower That's been handling the signal
is a tower near...
Albany street.
Dunham. Alistair peck is back at his residence.
six dead, including two boston p. D. Officers.
we have to take him down before he jumps again.
take it.
I haven't seen you look at that letter for a while.
it's been almost a year since alistair died.
today's the day I'm supposed to send it.
open it.
apparently, alistair felt whatever it is, He could put in your trust.
he wouldn't have sealed it If he wanted me to see what's inside.
Hey, I got you something.
fixed your turntable.
I'd tell you to keep it out of the lab this time, But I know you won't.
thank you, peter.
I thought maybe you'd like some music to cheer you up.
Walter, I know that you've been in a funk For the last couple of weeks.
if there's something you want to talk to me about
no.
something was weighing on me,
a decision, but...
I'm fine.
okay.
I'm gonna go hit the hay.
I crossed into another universe and took a son that wasn't mine.
not a day has passed without me feeling the burden of that act.
Peter deserves to know the truth about who he is.
you saved his life.
I am sure that he will understand.
you didn't just open up a hole to the other side.
you brought me back.
son, this-- I am not your son.
Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago.
he's gone.
I've decided that we need to get organized.
you've been smoking marijuana.
I'd hardly classify what I've just smoked as marijuana.
it's--it's a hybrid.
of chronic supernova and Afghani kush.
I call it brown betty.
I know how you're feeling.
it's important to take control of one's life.
Peter is going to come back.
he just needs some time.
but he will come back.
is there news? Have you found him?
I'm sorry, Walter.
I have some leads that I would like to follow up, but I have to
you have to what?
what can be more important than finding Peter?
aunt Liv...The snack machine stole the dollar you gave me.
Hi, Astrid. Hi, uncle Walter.
Hi, Ella. You know what?
we have some snacks back there in the fridge.
you can go help yourself.
Thanks. Mm-hmm.
who's that?
Ella, Walter. - It smells funny in here.
Rachel's daughter.
Rachel's Olivia's sister.
Rachel had to go to Chicago for the weekend,
so she asked if I could look after Ella.
and I was wondering if maybe you could watch her.
Oh, no, no, no.
I couldn't possibly look after anyone else.
I'm well into phase one.
I think she's talking about me.
Walter just smoked something called "brown betty."
Hi, cow. - Be careful, Stella.
gene, Gene, no licking. No licking.
you should only have to watch her for a few hours.
don't worry, Olivia.
I will be here. We would love to have her.
you're killing him.
you're not supposed to touch the sides.
what kind of doctor are you?
you're not even trying.
his heart.
all you've done is eat all my snacks and talk about weird stuff.
and everything makes you laugh.
I know! Why don't you tell me a story?
I'm not very good at stories.
didn't you used to tell stories to Peter?
I'm sure Mrs. Bishop did, but...
no, I never told Peter stories.
I was always... too busy with my work.
what about your parents, Uncle Walter?
didn't they tell you stories?
Oh, yes.
my mother loved Chandler and another writer called Dashiell Hammett.
she loved detective stories.
Oh! And musicals!
she adored musicals!
she often would dress me up to play parts in plays at school.
I was roughed up quite a lot as a child.
Walter...I think that Ella would really, really enjoy a story.
once upon a time.
well, all right. Are you ready?
once upon a time...
there was an accomplished detective.
because there was one mystery she could not solve.
what was that?
how to mend a broken heart.
miss Dunham?
my name is Rachel. I'm sorry to just show up like this,
but I have left you several messages, and I'd like to hire you.
my boyfriend, he's gone missing.
well, as you can see, I'm kinda busy.
he got in over his head to a gambler.
a guy named big Eddie. I'm afraid something bad may have happened to him.
drown him? - I'm sorry, what?
Oh, uh, no, thank you.
you know, most times when someone comes in here.
worried that their sweetheart's gone missing, or worse...
by the time they find out what I usually find out,
they wind up wishing he really were dead.
what do you usually find out?
Rachel, is it?
do yourself a favor.
go home.
he wouldn't do what you're suggesting.
we met only a few weeks ago, but...
it was love at first sight.
you probably don't believe something like that exists.
but I assure you it does.
something happens and I'm head over heels. I never find out till I'm head over heels. Something happens and I'm head over heels. Don't take my heart, don't break my heart, don't, don't, don't throw it away.
what those school kids must've done to you.
maybe you should teach me algebra.
to contract his larnyx.
anyway, what was I saying?
Ah! Yes.
true love.
when was the last time you spoke to him?
on the telephone two days ago.
okay, and what's his name?
wait a minute. That's wrong.
my mom doesn't love Peter.
of course not. It's just a story.
but, as with all good stories,
things aren't always as they see.
so where were we?
she just took the case.
Oh, yes. How could she not?
see, what Rachel didn't know is that detective Olivia once believed in love.
especially great love.
and, if for no other reason, she took this case to see if such a love really existed.
now, this is where things might get a bit frightening.
I'm not sure you'd want me to go on.
does it have to do with Peter?
maybe.
it just might.
you see, just as Olivia was gathering the facts from Rachel,
far on the other side of town,
a young man had gone into hiding.
because he had in his possession a very special item.
what kind of item?
as it happens...
a heart.
but a heart unlike anything the world had ever seen.
Now...The measure of a good detective.
is where she gets her information from.
is he here?
detective Dunham knew some high people in low places.
and you just can't escape from the sound, don't worry too much, it'll happen to you, we were children once playing with toys.
Hello, lieutenant Broyles.
good to see you.
what's the matter? You're not gonna say hello?
well, now, I didn't know if you actually meant hello.
or if you were just stringing me along.
you're good at that.
I need to ask a favor.
must be a good one if you're coming to me.
not as good a favor as pretending six years ago.
I didn't see a cop on the beat plant evidence to get a promotion.
but yeah, it's important.
what is it?
missing person.
never seen him.
what about this?
does it mean anything to you?
that guy's sweetheart found it in her apartment. The night he vanished.
it's a company logo. Massive Dynamic.
ever heard of them?
no. What do they do?
question is, what don't they do?
indeed, what don't they do?
Olivia did her homework.
and soon found out some of the things they did do.
like what? - Massive Dynamic made its money at any cost.
a vile firm that never missed an opportunity to exploit the little guy.
profiteering off the creativity of others.
miss Dunham...Nina Sharp.
pleasure to meet you.
thank you so much for seeing me.
detective Broyles called on your behalf.
he said you were looking for someone?
you thought I may be able to provide some information?
uh, yes.
his name is Peter Bishop.
I'm investigating his disappearance on behalf of his fiancee.
she believes he may be in trouble.
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.
whatever trouble he's in, I'm sure he deserves much worse.
Peter Bishop is a con man with many talents and many identities.
all of them suspect.
small cons to large scale industrial espionage,
with only one person's interests at heart.
his own.
I see.
but I can tell you one thing.
if he's pretending to love this woman,
he must be using her somehow.
for her sake and yours, I hope he stays missing.
he's dangerous.
Ah, I'm sorry.
my attention is required on another matter.
of course.
thank you so much for your time.
miss Dunham.
you should proceed with caution.
I meant it when I said that Peter Bishop is dangerous.
it's me.
there has been a development.
Hello, this is Rachel. Please leave a message.
uh, this is Olivia Dunham.
I need to talk to you. It's about Peter Bishop.
so could you give me a call as soon as you get this?
Rachel? - Help me, Miss Dunham!
that's not how it goes.
she can't be dead.
why not?
probably because it's her mother, Walter.
Oh. No, that's not it.
because that's not how stories work.
she's in love-- True love.
she can't die.
but...as I have said, in this story,
things are not as they seem.
she was an actress.
her real name wasn't even Rachel, it was Kelsey.
don't ask me what to make of it, we're in the dark.
but whoever did this was good.
didn't leave fingerprints.
hell, we can't even identify what type of weapon he used.
but one thing we both know, Dunham.
death seems to follow you around.
what you sayin' there, chief?
I'm saying I want you as far away as possible.
just when my interest is piqued?
keep nosing around, and you and your interest.
can spend some time downtown as a guest of the state.
well, it's three hot meals and a bed.
it's tempting. But, uh...
I think I'll pass.
I'm serious, Dunham.
time to leave things to the big boys.
okay, you win.
directory Assistance?
Yes, operator, I would like an address, please.
go ahead, hon. What's the name?
uh, for Dr. Walter Bishop.
it's you.
kind of.
slightly less handsome than your uncle Walter.
but equally brilliant.
a taker, a dreamer.
and Olivia would soon discover.
that he was the one that got her mixed up in all this.
so you're saying that you hired her to hire me to find Peter Bishop?
that's right.
why didn't you come to me yourself?
Ah. Your reputation precedes you, Miss Dunham.
you aren't the best, but you're selective.
you only take cases where someone has lost their heart to love.
so I used her to get your attention.
I never meant for her to be harmed.
okay, well, you've got my attention now, Dr. Bishop.
now who the hell is Peter Bishop, and why are you looking for him?
he was my lab assistant.
you got the same name. You related?
just coincidental,
although I did grow to love Peter as a son.
but apparently, he was far more dangerous than I feared.
he stole something from me.
my most... Important invention.
I have spent my life making things that bring joy and happiness,
to make the world a better place.
bubble gum was one of my first.
Ah. Flannel pajamas.
Oh, rainbows.
and my latest project, singing corpses.
who can take a sunrise sprinkle it with dew cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two the candy man he candy man can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.
why not bring a little life to the dead, I say.
their harmonies are still a bit off.
what's this?
well, that's a hug, of course.
he invented hugs?
Oh, yes, my dear.
he invented everything that is wonderful in the world.
Teddy bears, and chocolate bars, and...
Oh, and something even more remarkable than that.
a heart.
a glass heart.
what makes it so special?
put simply, it's a power source.
but it's capable of many wondrous things.
and until quite recently...
I was kept alive his glass heart.
I had a bad heart,
and so I invented the glass heart.
and then a few nights ago, someone slipped into my room.
and stole it while I was asleep.
I've done what I can with these batteries.
it's kept me stable, but...
if I don't get my heart back, I'll die.
you think Peter Bishop stole your heart?
they disappeared at the same time.
this heart is priceless.
who knows what somebody would pay for it.
I have so much good left to do.
if I die, I'll never get to finish any of them.
all of my ideas...
they will all die with me.
she's gonna help him, right?
of course.
but first, she needed to rehire her assistant, Esther Ficklesworth.
I have plenty of experience with all kinds of people.
I'm sure that would come in handy, right?
I mean, mental patients probably need tons of patience.
and love too. They probably need love, right?
I really need this job, please god, I need this job, I've got to get this job.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
Oh, it's my old boss now.
can you give me just a second?
she only calls when it's important.
or when she gets lost.
what do you want?
new case. I need you.
you sent me packing this morning,
and you owe me six months' back-pay.
what makes you think I'm gonna drop everything just because you call?
because it's important.
and because that's just the kind of girl you are.
Dunham? Dunham, are you.
drop what you're investigating.
who the hell are you?
don't stick your heart out where it doesn't belong.
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?
Oh, no, no, no. It feels great, actually.
please, keep-- keep doing it.
I can't believe you got sucked back into business over true love.
you know that's your problem, isn't it?
you're always looking for something that doesn't even exist.
Hey, that's not true.
I'm not looking for someone who's gonna give his heart to the world.
maybe somewhere in the universe there's gotta be a guy.
who will keep me warm when I'm cold,
feed me when I'm hungry,
and maybe, on occasion, take me dancing.
huh, that's odd.
it looks like it's healing.
what kind of weapon did you say he used?
well, nothing that I'd ever seen before. It was, like, some kind of...
laser.
this is the same kind of wound that killed Rachel.
so the man who attacked me is the same man who took her heart.
draw it.
draw what?
the weapon.
I have an idea.
Yeah, the patent on this device was taken out last year.
pretty cool little device, if I recall.
was patented by this whiz-bang tech company out of Manhattan.
boy, I wish I could work somewhere like that.
big outfit, all kinds of spy stuff.
they go by the name of...
you can't go in there! Miss Dunham!
a few hours ago, a man attacked me with that,
and told me to forget I'd ever heard the name Peter Bishop.
now I can call the feds or you can tell me the truth.
you choose, lady.
bring me the file on the quantum laser.
the device was developed here in our biomedical research lab.
it was designed as a surgical tool.
several months ago, one of our prototypes was stolen.
but tell me... This man who attacked you,
was he bald, with an odd cadence to his voice?
who is he?
not he, they.
we call them the watchers.
these people are dangerous.
and they don't make idle threats.
you should know what you're getting into, Miss Dunham.
she was lying.
who? - Nina Sharp.
she was lying, wasn't she?
what makes you think that?
I don't know, I just don't trust her.
smart girl.
you're getting ahead of the narrative,
but you're thinking along the right lines.
because detective Oivia didn't trust her either. Now...
Hello? - Its me. You got anything?
Nina Sharp's company, Massive Dynamic,
the founder and CEO is a guy named William Bell.
you ever heard of him?
no. Should I have?
well, it seems he's a sort of scientific Christopher Columbus.
he's always searching for what's right on the edge of our imagination.
but here is the interesting part.
in the past few years, no one has seen him.
no press conferences, no public appearances.
it's like he just disappeared off the face of the earth.
okay, so what's that got to do with Peter Bishop?
I don't know.
but that's weird, right?
Yeah. Listen, I gotta go.
Hey, Dunham? - Yeah?
be careful.
okay, ma.
I have news. Is it safe to talk?
of course, no one can hear us.
what is it? - I found it.
the glass heart? - Mm, you were right.
Peter Bishop has it.
so where is he? Where's the boy?
we don't know yet. But we'll find him.
Oh, that's fabulous news.
well done, Nina. I knew you could do it.
William, I've been going out of my mind.
by utilizing the heart's power,
we'll be able to create a stable door between universes.
and after all this time, we can finally be together again.
I know, my love.
excuse me.
she is awake.
I see.
I suppose I should feel sorry for you, Miss Dunham.
none of these should've been your concerns.
the truth is I did everything I could to protect you.
I warned you to stay away from this,
but you didn't listen.
now you've given me no choice.
Oh, so you're gonna send me somewhere far away,
where I won't be able to tell anybody what you wanna do with that glass heart?
not quite.
go ahead, Mr. Gemini.
no, no! No, no, no! Ah.
No!
help me! No! Ah!
I heard you were looking for me.
thank you.
feeling better?
do you mean is a hot shower better than drowning in a pine coffin?
much. Thank you.
I take it you don't live here.
no, but nobody else does either.
seemed like a pretty good place to hide out.
but this is yours.
Yeah.
what is it?
you hungry?
so how'd you know I was drowning?
coffee?
Yeah, one sugar. Thanks.
well, like I told you before, I heard somebody was looking for me.
a cop named Olivia Dunham.
so I was following you.
well, someone's been giving you false information,
because I'm not a cop, I'm a private detective.
I see.
you like jazz?
jazz?
you can tell a lot about a person from the music they listen to.
and whether or not they dance.
uh, well, jazz... Not so much.
but dancing? Sure.
well, I guess we're opposites.
I hate to dance.
I'd take you, though.
you would?
Why's that?
I don't know, seems like it'd be fun.
you look like a good dancer.
you know, all this is very nice, and I'm grateful that you saved my life,
but I know who you are, and I know what you did.
wanna know why I was looking for you?
Dr. Walter Bishop hired me.
I know you took his glass heart.
is that what he told you?
that I stole his heart?
what else did Walter Bishop tell you?
that without his heart he would die.
and that all the good he does for this world would die with him.
well, I guess I'm not the only one who's been given false information.
what, you saying that's not true?
come with me.
147 pins.
each one represents a child injured by Walter Bishop.
injured how?
Walter's invented a great many things.
wondrous things. That much is true.
but what he didn't tell you is where his ideas come from.
elephants, rainbows, licorice sticks...
they come from the dreams of children.
he steals children's dreams.
and he replaces them with nightmares.
that's what this is, a pattern of destruction.
of damaged kids, shattered innocence.
who else knows about this?
nobody.
I worked for him for years, and I didn't even know.
why I was willing to die so that he could live.
it's your heart.
I was born with it.
and I was willing to give it to Walter, 'cause of all the good he's done.
because of all the good he could do.
I thought that his life was so much more valuable than mine.
at least until I learned the truth.
Walter Bishop isn't responsible for all the goodness in the world.
but he is responsible for so much evil.
Oh, hell.
what is it? - They found us.
I knew you were a good dancer.
you really cut a rug out there.
well, you're not so bad yourself.
I need your help, Olivia.
I'm dying.
okay, I got them.
so--so what do I do?
you ever play that game operation?
well, it's just like that, except in reverse.
you gotta put those batteries into my chest.
but whatever you do,
don't touch the nerve endings.
and what if I do?
don't.
okay.
you're gonna be fine.
just go slow,
and take them one at a time.
okay.
so what made you wanna be a detective?
I don't know.
uh, I, uh...
I guess that I just always knew what it was I was meant to do.
and what's that?
to care for people.
then who cares for you?
I did it.
okay.
there's one more.
must be nice to know who you are.
to know your place in the world.
so what about you?
Oh, I thought I did.
I thought I knew who I was.
but I was wrong.
done.
please, Peter.
for once in my life I have someone who needs me someone I've needed so long for once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I'll be strong for once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me not like it's hurt me before for once I have something I know won't desert me I'm not alone anymore
you did it.
okay. You be careful.
these batteries aren't gonna last long.
okay. We have to get my heart back.
those men who attacked us, they work for Nina Sharp.
but Nina Sharp isn't the one who's got your heart.
then who does?
put it down, Dr. Bishop.
how did you know it was me?
the device--the one that came through the wall.
I knew that I had seen it someplace before.
you brought Nina Sharp's watchers to your side. Didn't you?
I--I never meant to hurt anyone.
I never-- I can change, you'll see.
I can make up for all the harm I've done.
Peter, please.
who can take the sunrise sprinkle it with dew the candy man can
Peter, please.
it's too late, Walter.
there's some things you can't undo.
the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good. Are you kidding?
that's not a proper ending.
don't you know?
all good stories start with "once upon a time,"
and they end with " happily ever after."
you don't know how to tell stories, uncle Walter.
I'll tell you how the story ends.
Peter. Peter, please.
I can change.
I can fix the damage I've done.
please, give me another chance.
and Peter looked inside Walter's eyes.
and realized there was still goodness inside him.
so Peter took his special heart,
and with all his might, he split it in two.
and the heart was so magical that it still worked.
and together, they made goodness,
and lived happily ever after.
the end.
aunt Liv!
we had so much fun. - Did you?
that's great. - We played games kind of badly.
then uncle Walter told me a story.
I'm sorry, Walter. No luck.
his ending wasn't very good.
it was sad. But I fixed it for him.
didn't I, uncle Walter?
Yes. Yes, my dear, you were right.
yours was a proper ending.
yours was a much better ending, indeed.
the boy has not returned.
and I do not believe Dr. Bishop remembers my warning.
Yes, I am concerned too.
surgeries that Newton performed.
he was removing transplanted brain tissue.
you nearly died when you were a boy.
Walternate found a cure of Peter.
Walter, Peter is dead.
I'm talking about the other Peter.
the one on the other side.
I'm not from here, am I?
son-- - I am not your son.
Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago.
he's gone.
drink that, avoid the radar, You'll be in oakland in no time.
and that is for you, Raymond.
and your burger should be up in a minute.
So...Where was I?
well, you were in the middle of telling me how you moved around a lot as a kid,
but I got to tell you, now I'm hopelessly intrigued with these CDs.
I'm sort of known here by the regulars for my playlists.
I base my tracks on people's aura.
well, how often do you think I'd have to come here to be considered a regular?
I might be able to get you on the list.
first, you have to tell me where you're from.
technically...
I'm from no place you've ever heard of.
but let's just say Boston.
so how long are you here for?
well, I was just planning on the one night.
passing through.
to?
I don't know yet.
okay...
Peter from Boston.
I'll burn you one.
Really?
what did I do right?
it's a long road to "I don't know yet."
I want to make sure you stay awake out there.
and I, uh-- I like your eyes.
so there's that.
where are you staying?
I'm staying at the Drake's Bay motel.
I'll drop it by after my shift.
okay, I'll see you then.
I'll see you then.
what are you doing to me?
your room's got a bed, you know.
what time is it?
6: 00 a. m.
did a pretty girl happen to drop by here?
Hello?
Hello?
destination.
please say a city name.
Portland. - Portland.
please proceed to the highlighted route.
that was obviously way too easy.
destination.
please say a city name.
Mars.
sorry. Please say the city name.
how you doing? I'm sheriff Mathis.
this is deputy Ferguson.
Hi, there. Peter Bishop.
were you a customer here last night?
I was.
do you remember your waitress?
Krista, sure.
why, did something happen to her?
do you have any identification on you?
of course.
Krista told a coworker.
she was planning to meet you after her shift last night.
you gonna tell me what's going on here?
you first.
Yeah, we made plans.
but she never showed up.
she was gonna meet me at my motel, the Drake's Bay,
but I just fell asleep in the lobby.
you can call the front desk, ask the guy there.
why don't you just hang here a sec, okay?
where are you goin'?
who are you lookin' for?
no one.
Oh, come on, you got to be kidding me.
Krista Manning went missing last night.
and you talked to her. You two spent some time.
I'd just like to hear about it.
I'd like to do that at the station, okay?
uh, six feet, brown hair.
officer, I wasn't staying under the name Bishop.
I was registered under the name Stewart.
Yeah, he says he was staying under the name Stewart.
right, okay. Thanks, Tom.
Tom over at Drake's Bay confirms that he was passed out in the lobby all night.
why did you check into the motel under an assumed name, sir?
sheriff?
this is Mathis. Go ahead.
dogs have found a body--The spillway off route 219 and mile marker 8.
white female coroner's on her way.
Oh, my god.
Noyo search and rescue, what's your 20?
E.T.A. about 45.
confirm this is recovery, not rescue.
that's right, Wes. It's a bad one.
the coroner says the victim had some sort of operation done to her.
a piece of her skull cut out. Over.
Sheriff...Can you let me out of the back of this car?
just--please, I'm sorry,
but you're gonna have to be patient, Mr. Bishop.
hold on for one second. Hold on.
I was listening to your radio.
they said that she had a piece of her skull cut out.
is she missing a part of her brain?
I know that that's a weird question,
but you need to ask the coroner whether she's missing a piece of her temporal lobe.
please.
how the hell did you know that?
you're F.B.I. huh?
what exactly is a civilian consultant?
sometimes people with certain areas of expertise.
can offer them to the bureau on a consulting basis.
my area of expertise is...weird.
you mean difficult to explain?
no, I mean the strange, the inexplicable.
so, uh...
can you talk me through this again?
you knew that they took her...
temporal lobe. - Temporal lobe...
because it's like a case you worked on before?
exactly. We were never able to catch those responsible.
so that's why you're out here.
you're tracking them down?
no.
but I think that they may be tracking me down.
What'd they want with you?
I'm not sure yet.
but I thought I saw one of them earlier outside the crime scene.
his name is Newton.
and I think they called me at the Drake's Bay motel.
there was no voice on the other end of the line.
it was just static, and then a series of strange noises and clicks.
I think they killed Krista to find me.
by taking her brain?
I told her where I was staying.
she's the only person who knew.
why wouldn't they just...ask her where you were staying? Or force her.
I mean, why cut out her brain?
it's possible that they needed details about me she didn't know she had.
I'm sorry. I'm not following.
I know that this is complicated.
and I'm sorry that I can't give you all the answers,
but the case is classified.
it is possible, however, that I could show you what I mean.
just give me a minute.
I'm gonna go make a few calls, Peter.
of course.
Bishop, where are you?
I'll save you the trace.
I'm in Washington State.
look, I need a favor.
you're about to get a call from the Noyo county sheriff's department.
they're checking up on my credentials.
are you in trouble?
in fact, just the opposite.
I stumbled into an investigation, and I offered them my services.
we'll ask them to extend you every courtesy.
thank you. Listen...
I don't want you to tell Walter where I am.
in fact, I don't even want you to tell him that we spoke.
if you owe me anything, you owe me that.
okay. But, Bishop...
if you change your mind, I'll send someone to pick you up.
Thanks. I got to go.
take care of yourself.
Krista seemed like a sweet girl. Did you know her?
she and my sister went to school together.
so explain this to me.
the temporal lobe is responsible for memory.
so think of the brain as the greatest recording device ever created.
every sight, sound, smell, all recorded in perfect detail.
but imagine that there was a way to get that data out of the brain.
so what I said, what I was wearing,
what time it was, where I was staying...
I know how it sounds.
but believe me, if you can imagine it, It's possible.
if that's true, if they were trying to find you,
why didn't they just come for you last night?
I-I don't know.
these are not your ordinary bad guys.
the tissue is very pink.
Yes, and it's not normally like that.
it only happens when our bodies metabolize adrenaline.
so her adrenal's must have spiked right before she died.
Oh...My god.
find "the crack"?
that is the worst police slogan I've ever heard.
it's not a slogan.
in the darkness, There's always a crack.
it's how the light gets in.
ferguson gave it to me...
our first case together.
nobody else thought I could hack it, but...
it's--it's an inside joke.
it looks expensive.
Yeah.
that's what he keeps telling me.
if that's an accurate account of your statement, Please sign it.
it is, very.
I'm gonna get a room at the Northwest Passage.
I'll be staying under the name of...
so if you need me, that's where I'm at.
you sure you don't want a police escort?
no, I'll be fine.
look, they may have found me.
but now that I know they're here for sure, I found them too.
and now we're gonna catch 'em.
what?
I don't know about this guy, Ann.
he knew his way around there.
he's like a medical examiner.
he knew the brain, biology, medications.
doesn't mean he's legit.
you read your books about UFOs and Roswell.
and whacked-out theories and government conspiracies.
I think that you want to believe.
what makes you trust him?
I don't know.
I'm a good judge of character.
I'm the only one here who likes you.
closed. What do you want?
if you open up, I'll make it worth your while.
what do you want from me?
Peter...It's Mathis.
who did you tell?
what are you talking about?
just now, I got one of those phone calls.
they know where I'm staying.
and I only told you. - I didn't.
then ask your partner!
that's what I'm calling about, Peter.
ferguson's disappeared.
when was the last time that you spoke with him?
about two hours.
he went back to the scene where Krista's body was found.
he felt we might have missed something.
that means that he disappeared about a half hour before I got the last phone call.
you think they used him to find you,
like they used Krista.
what is it that makes you special?
why haven't they taken you?
I don't know.
I don't even know what it all means,
but I do know that these people have the answers.
and that's exactly why I need to find them.
all right, then, call your friends at the F.B.I.
let's get these guys! - No.
the F.B.I. has the expertise. They have the resources.
and if we call the F.B.I. They're gonna descend on this place,
and these people will disappear.
I am this close.
and I am going to get my answers.
you said you got calls at Drake's Bay and Northwest Passage, right?
Yes.
well, we pulled those phone records.
those calls never happened.
these people can pull memories out of brain tissue.
you think they can't make a couple of calls disappear?
I can do that. People have been doing that since the 70s.
I understand.
you don't want me to be right, cause if I'm right, then that means your partner is most likely dead.
with the exception of who you are,
I haven't been able to verify anything you've said to me.
it's all either classified, or it's incredible.
I'm calling the bureau.
your partner did disappear.
and I did talk to Krista.
and I did get those phone calls.
what if he's alive?
what if he's out there somewhere, thinking I am doing everything in my power,
including calling the F.B. I. to save him?
then that is all the more reason for us to find him ourselves.
if you ask that phone call, we never will.
excuse me, please.
thank you.
toaster pastry.
Um..."corn starch," "soy lecithin,"
Potassium...bromate.
potassium bromate?
this supermarket is trying to kill us!
You...Potassium bromate - Do you know what that is?
are you okay, sir?
it is known to induce renal cell tumors...
Mesotheliomas of the peritoneum!
can I call someone for you?
call someone? You know what?
you know what you're putting into our bodies?
death! Delicious, strawberry-flavored death!
okay, okay. I'm calling security.
Yes!
they had no right to make me wait at the police station.
it's the makers of those toaster pastries that should be in jail.
let it go, Walter.
you're home now, and you're safe.
I wasn't expecting guests.
why didn't you tell me you needed help?
what am I going to do.
call you every time I run out of pudding pops?
Yes, if you need them.
I need to learn to care for myself.
if Peter doesn't come back.
they'll send me back to the hospital, won't they?
I won't let that happen.
thank you.
I do...I do need pudding pops.
we don't know if he made it,
but this is the last place he said he was going.
isn't it protocol for him to call in once he gets here?
Well...Sometimes he doesn't do that.
dummy.
what did you see?
I saw Newton and one other guy.
you didn't see them too? They came running right past you.
what's wrong?
what the hell are you doing, Bishop?
put down that gun.
who are you?
Bishop...Lower... Your...Weapon.
in the morgue, you dropped something.
who gave it to you?
what is wrong with you?
answer the question!
my pen?
it was a gift from Ferguson, my partner.
why is there blood on your jacket?
there is blood on my jacket because there is blood on my wrist,
which I got when I fell, running.
show me.
I'm sorry.
I needed to know that your blood was still red.
what other color would it be?
so these, uh, shape-shifters, they...
make themselves look like other people?
Yeah, it's a technology unlike anything you've seen before.
I want to level with you.
I, um...
believe in the unknown.
Yeah. "Find the crack." I get it.
no, I mean...
I read books about...
UFOs and conspiracy theories.
but I do think...
I mean, I am wondering right now...
if you are not completely off your rocker.
they were there. - I didn't see them...
or the dart they shot.
I know you didn't, because they removed it.
I know how this must look...
from your point of view-- I mean, I was there once too.
but...
you just did it.
did what? - You just questioned your own sanity.
I'm not questioning-- - When was the last time you slept?
I'm not hallucinating.
and I'm not paranoid. And I'm not questioning my own sanity.
I was wondering why you would listen to me.
you're desperate.
ferguson is more than just your partner, isn't he?
so there is something between the two of you.
you said back at the precinct that...
that I was trying to rationalize that he was still alive.
you may be right.
I may be doing it right now. He may be dead.
but I won't believe it until I see his body.
I can't.
you want me to go look?
sheriff. The victim's a white female.
she has part of her skull missing.
I don't recognize this girl.
you never seen her before?
no, I've never seen her before.
who is she?
I talked to Gwynn right before her shift ended.
we'd talked about her coming over last night to help me color my hair.
I figured she just got tired.
I should have called her.
you couldn't have known.
I'm sorry.
did your sister ever hang out at the Hilltop Cafe?
um... I don't think so.
what about the Mosser Brothers gas station out on Route 202?
I filled up there on the way into town.
her pickup's a diesel, and I don't think Mosser's carries diesel.
fine, what about the Drake's Bay motel? Would she ever go there for any reason?
Peter... - What's this about?
it's just...part of our investigation.
if you could just write down your address for us.
she is grieving, And you are not getting anywhere.
the hadron super collider is less complicated than that infernal dishwater.
next time, don't use laundry detergent, and the dishwasher will work fine.
thank you, Astrid.
you're a federal agent.
I doubt, during your years of training,
that you had dreams of babysitting a helpless old man.
you are not that helpless.
a little disorganized, maybe.
don't you usually keep this in the bathtub?
I took this little car from the Zelazney building.
objects from the other universe like this emit a glimmer,
a distinctive energy signature.
it may be possible to detect that signature.
so?
so I need you to gather all the objects from the other side.
that we recovered from the Zelazney building
and from Jacksonville and bring them to the lab.
okay, why? - To build a device to read that energy signature!
Peter emits the same energy, don't you see?
this is how we will find Peter.
I must have seen Gwynn somewhere,
or she had to have seen me. I mean...
she has to have had some value to them, some knowledge that they needed.
we'll go to your motel and get your things,
get you something to eat, and...
you can stay at my house tonight.
it's okay. I'll be fine.
you're my only connection to finding Bill right now.
I want you safe.
what color was Gwynn's truck?
tan brown.
driver's side window is rolled down.
glove compartment's open.
okay, so this girl pulls over her truck,
rolls down the window, and then opens up the glove box.
you tell me - why would she do that?
she got pulled over by a cop.
or someone pretending to be a cop--or Bill.
pretending to be Bill?
well, these shape-shifters, they take on the appearance of people in positions of authority.
where you going?
I'm calling the F.B.I.
Why?
first, you said they cut out his brain to find you.
now you're telling me he may have been shape-shifted?
which is it, Peter?
did I make a mistake not calling the F.B.I?
I am very scared right now.
wait, wai--wait. Just hold on for one second.
those people, when they were taken, they must have been afraid, right?
and when they were killed, they must have been terrified.
so?
so I know how to find them.
do you know how airplanes have blackboxes?
to record flight data, sure.
Yeah, well, human bodies collect data as well.
both Krista and Gwynn's muscle tissue was flooded with adrenaline.
Yeah, I remember.
well, the tissue would've partially metabolized the adrenaline.
so we should be able to measure the rate of absorption,
which will tell us when the adrenaline was first produced.
what about Newton?
how does that help us find him?
Look...Normally,
your adrenaline levels are flat.
then you experience fear.
a spike in adrenaline.
sometime later, you experience more fear,
say, in the moments right before you were killed.
another spike, two points of fear.
now, we already know where the girls were abducted.
so if we can just determine how much time took place between these two intervals...
then we can figure out where they were killed.
exactly right.
there is one more thing.
we're gonna need a control sample.
can you stick that in the centrifuge?
it's that thing right over there.
Hey! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
I just needed to scare you.
I'm gonna need to take a tissue sample from you.
how is Dr. Bishop doing?
Walter's trying to adjust to a very difficult situation.
he's concerned about being sent back to ST. Claire's.
will he be able to function if Peter doesn't come back?
I'm sure that Peter will come back.
do you know something?
have you spoken to him?
Krista Manning's adrenaline spikes were 42 minutes apart.
so assuming that Newton drove the speed limit, 60 miles an hour.
on these roads, that'd be a good way to get killed. He would have stuck to 45.
all right, 45.
okay, the center point is where Krista was taken.
at 45 miles per hour,
the farthest they could have gone would be 31 1/2 miles.
gwynn, our second victim...
was taken much farther out of town,
almost on the other side of the county.
her adrenaline spikes are 57 minutes apart.
again, factoring 45 miles per hour...
that's it.
that's our kill zone.
you're assuming he killed them both in the same place.
they were using complex medical equipment.
it's not easy to move an operating room.
much simpler to just bring the victims to a specified location.
someplace out of the way.
like an old dairy farm?
just ask him something only he would know.
Hello, there.
it's, uh, Craig, right? - Yeah.
I don't know if you remember, but, uh,
I think you were in choir with my sister up at st. Andrew's.
well, actually, I was at good shepherd.
good memory, though.
Yeah, good shepherd - That's right.
so, uh, what can I do for you?
your old dairy farm up the hill.
could there be people up there?
people? - Yeah, you get up there often?
no, not much, since we shut it down.
Why?
okay, we got 12 outbuildings.
the milking parlors, the barn, and the holding stalls.
those are all good places to hide.
that's a lot of ground to cover.
I'll go call backup to help with the search.
need any help with the search?
I think it's best if you stay here.
let me get you the keys. - Sure.
who are you? Where's Newton?
Peter, stop!
I couldn't stop.
the girls--I wanted to be close to them.
I just couldn't stop.
where is he? Where's Ferguson?
what did you do to him?
he's still breathing. Thank god.
it's just ink. There's no incision here.
I'm gonna go call an ambulance.
stay with me, baby.
I'm here.
I'm here now.
I'm here, Bill.
I don't know what to say.
you saved Bill's life, and you tracked a killer - what else is there to say?
I wish there was something I could do for you.
whatever your experiences are,
whatever you can't or won't tell me about...
I think you're looking for meaning in things.
That...have no meaning.
I don't know who I am anymore.
when I was in college...
my family was killed, murdered.
I'm sorry.
sometimes I still think...
one day I might catch whoever did it.
I was alone for a long time.
but I found my place.
you will too.
once we isolate the glimmer, we can find Peter.
is the spectrograph ready, agent Farnsworth?
Walter, you put in the wrong numbers.
no, no, I believe they're correct.
no, they're not.
but, then, you know that already, don't you?
I thought you wanted to find Peter.
what if he won't forgive me, Astrid?
all I have now is hope.
hope that he will come to understand why I did the things I did.
what if I find him, and he won't forgive me?
what do I have then?
Hey. Hey, Olivia.
I found Peter.
w-where?
he's in Washington State.
I'm heading to the airport now.
would you like to come with me, Walter?
I'll need to pack a bag.
Mr. Secretary.
Hello, son.
an unstable wormhole has quarantined by Fringe Division citizens in case of Quarantine Amber have been ruled legally dead.
this is gonna sound nuts...
when she was having her breakdown she kept on and on about how they were trying to make her believe she was somebody else.
what if she's telling the truth?
what if it's not the real her?
that is nuts.
you're right.
how does she seem? -Like Olivia Dunham.
for all intents and purposes, she is Agent Dunham.
you're not from this world, Olivia.
you're not real.
real is just a matter of perception.
and I'm a part of you that you have to hold on to.
you can't forget who you are, Olivia.
you've been back with fringe division for a week now?
uh...for eight days.
any headaches or lingering symptoms...
mood swings, insomnia?
no. Although I do feel like I keep getting asked the same question
over and over again. Is that a lingering symptom?
you are recovering from a severe mental break,
agent Dunham... I have to ask you these questions.
Yeah. I know.
please accept my apologies For the poking and prodding, Agent Dunham.
uh, Mr. Secretary.
you look well.
I am. Good as new.
did you get the dossier I sent over?
Yes, sir.
so you really believe
that the other Olivia Dunham can cross between universes.
it would appear so.
thus far, we've developed some means of our own,
but each of them has dangerous side effects.
but it seems their Olivia can travel between worlds safely,
which is the real reason you're here today.
we believe you may be able to do the same.
how would I be able to do that?
I don't know...Yet.
but with your permission,
we'd like to put you through a series of experiments
to see if we're right.
I'm sure you understand...
what this would mean to our cause.
we'd be able to defend ourselves against the other side.
but...I know you've been through a lot, Olivia.
so if you're not up to it, you should just say so.
you can take as many pills as you want.
I'm not going anywhere.
you're not here.
look, I understand why you agreed to take the test.
you just want things to go back to normal,
to be the Olivia that you think you should be,
but unfortunately, that's not gonna happen.
because you're not their Olivia.
and you can keep on telling yourself that you're fine,
but you're not fine.
you're not sleeping.
and I'm not a lingering symptom.
you can't ignore me.
all right, easy.
got it? - Yep.
careful.
I said careful!
have your gun?
okay, ready?
I got it.
he's not breathing. He's dead.
no, he's not dead. Gimme...gimme the syringe.
gimme the syringe!
come on, buddy, come on. Come on, come on, come on.
nothing.
come on! Come on!
warning. Quarantine area breach.
the cops are gonna be here any minute. We gotta move.
breathe!
come on, breathe! Come on!
okay, you're okay. Cut him out, cut him out!
you okay? Yeah...
okay, give me a minute. We're gonna cut you out, okay?
come on, pick it up!
Oh, God. Here.
pull. Come on, come on, pull.
just pull. Come on! Pull, come on, pull!
come on, man, come on, come on, pull!
help me. Please!
wilner, I'm sorry. He's my brother.
No! Please!
don't leave me!
homemade laser knife.
it's clean. There's no fingerprints.
pretty sophisticated tech for looters.
well, you gotta hand it to 'em.
no one's ever removed anything from the quarantine zone,
yet they keep trying.
lotta purses and wallets in there.
like Cary grant said...
the stuff that dreams are made of.
you got something?
I don't know yet.
I'll be right back.
well, look who's here.
Yeah. Traffic.
third time this week.
you gotta stop taking the Nixon parkway.
you okay? You seem a little run down.
Oh, yeah. Frank's on assignment, And I never sleep very well when he's away.
so you gonna bring me up to speed?
in 1989, these isolated tears in the fabric of our universe
began to increase in frequency.
some of them expanded into micro black holes with devastating consequences.
to contain these events,
scientists designed a quarantine protocol using a chemical substance, Amber 31422.
all right, just fast forward.
what are you looking for?
I was just watching this a couple of weeks ago.
I just...Remember something a little differently.
right there. Freeze it.
Thanks.
four years ago, this station was sealed.
now it looks like we have a new addition.
meet our thief.
must have gotten caught in the reseal.
mark Wilmer. Couple counts of burglary.
you know, breaking into Amber Seems awfully ambitious for a small-time crook.
something tells me he wasn't after purses.
so this is where the powerful hide out.
just those that need to do some thinking Before they head home.
thank you for meeting me.
understand you're working on a case...
a man removed from Amber.
Franklin street station.
we're trying to determine why someone would go to all that trouble to steal him.
when I first...developed the Amber,
the universe was degrading at an alarming rate.
people were becoming afraid to leave their homes.
october 17, 1989.
and then there was the breach at Harvard yard.
if we hadn't contained it, half of Boston would have been swallowed up.
63 civilians were trapped in Amber that day...
and all the hundreds since.
it sickens me.
sir...
it's a tragic, but a small price to pay for the greater good.
people understand that.
perhaps.
but if they were to find out
that the Amber victims could be removed and resuscitated,
I'm afraid the outcry would be akin to revolt.
quarantine victims are alive?
theoretically.
but to remove them would weaken the structural integrity of the Amber.
we'll recover them before anyone finds out, sir.
Oh, and another thing.
Olivia Dunham has agreed to submit to the tests developed by science division.
as I've said, these...tests are stressful.
if she becomes unstable in any way...
if I see any unusual behavior, I'll let you know.
nature doesn't recognize good and evil, Phillip.
nature only recognizes balance and imbalance.
I intend to restore balance to our world.
whatever it takes.
Really? You never did that before?
make my own Popsicles? - Yeah.
Aw. My mom used to have these plastic molds,
and you'd pour fruit juice into them and then stick them in the freezer.
my mom...
made me get her cigarettes.
Ah. So who's the Popsicle?
I worked his case with fringe division four years ago.
he's a bank robber.
well, why would fringe division be appointed to investigate a robber?
rose used some kind of device that allowed him to access the vaults without setting off the bank alarms.
but what it also did was cause molecular degradation.
man-made breaches.
we studied that case back at the academy.
you guys had to quarantine what... half a dozen areas?
one very every job rose pulled.
the bank above Franklin station was Rose's last job.
he got caught in the quarantine.
now, it's possible that he was taken out In order to be revived.
revived?
what I'm about to tell you is classified.
the people entombed in Amber Are in a state of suspended animation.
sir.
if people knew that their loved ones were still alive in there...
I understand, Agent Dunham.
which is why we need to recover Rose,
whatever state he's in, as soon as possible.
he had an apartment that was sealed after he was ambered.
start there.
shh, shh, shh. Just rest.
you'll be fine.
just needs time to recover, Danielle.
my first partner got caught in an Amber quarantine in Boston.
his little girl just turned six last week.
if I get ambered...
just leave me in there.
does that feel familiar?
two people who look exactly alike.
you find anything?
what do we know about Rose's family?
never married.
no kids. Parents are dead.
he has a brother Matthew, an accountant.
Broyles said he was very cooperative In their investigation.
okay. Uh, maybe we should talk to him again.
Hey, guys.
jackpot.
anybody recognize any of this stuff?
some of it. Ion lasers.
pneumo drills. Some kinda gas.
looks like he was trying to build some kind of negative matter ring.
okay, Mr. Wizard. Some of us don't have a fancy degree.
creates high frequency vibrations.
which could weaken the atomic structure of the bank's walls.
that would explain how Rose was able to get inside.
he walked through walls? - It's possible.
okay, now I know you pulled that outta your ass.
listen.
go! Now!
this might sting a bit. Okay.
dinner is on me tonight, Liv.
Evvia, Pimlico. Whatever you want.
big spender.
what's the occasion?
Olivia saved our lives.
she heard the bomb before it went off,
and we had enough time to get out the apartment.
good work, Agent. - Thank you, sir.
you I. D. the symbol on those tanks?
ferrocene. It's a compound used in negative matter rings.
Oh ho! What did I say?
anyone ever tell you gloating isn't attractive?
hold still, Agent Francis.
that looks pretty bad.
why don't you take this off? I'll get the doctor.
okay.
soon as we're done, We're gonna go talk to Joshua Rose's brother.
okay.
you got it? I'll be right back, all right?
I'll be right back.
Matthew Rose? - Yeah. What can I do for you?
agent Lee, fringe division.
this is Agent Dunham.
what's going on?
what we're about to ask you is classified.
it's about your brother Joshua...
any idea about his where abouts?
you know, four years ago you people told me that he was trapped in Amber.
you telling me you were wrong?
we can't go into detail.
but if we were wrong, would he contact you?
my... my brother...
ripped families apart, okay?
mothers and husbands trapped in Amber because of the crimes he committed.
he'd know better than to contact me.
do you have any idea what it was like for me when Joshua's face started showing up on the news?
I mean, every time I went to the market, to a movie,
take my kids to little league...
people would look at me and see him.
that must have been very difficult for you.
you know, just because we look alike,
it doesn't mean we have anything in common.
we appreciate your time, Mr. Rose.
if you hear anything...
Yeah.
all this time I thought my brother was a pain in the ass.
gotta go to the D.O.D. They're ready for me.
you sure you're up for this?
I mean, you just started back to work.
Yeah.
I can handle it. But thank you...
mom.
Where's Danielle?
she, uh... She's at the store.
she's gonna be back in a minute.
I don't know how to say this, but...
you, uh...
you came to the bank to try and stop me,
but you were too late.
I mean, I didn't know.
I couldn't know you were coming.
you were trying to stop me from robbing a bank,
and I ended up stealing your life.
but you're free now.
it took me longer than I thought, But I never gave up.
how are our boys?
they're so big, you're not gonna believe it. They're giants.
it's okay. It's okay.
genetically, you're exact replicas, You and the other Olivia.
which means, theoretically,
you both should be capable of the same thing.
in the isolation tank, you'll be freed from sensory distractions,
so the part of your brain which enables you to travel between universes should be more accessible.
and we will help the process along by giving you a number of psychotropic drugs.
there's a speaker in the tank, so you'll be able to hear us.
and we'll be monitoring you closely.
you ready?
just like riding the roller coaster at Coney island, right?
close it.
Olivia, can you hear me?
we'll start the drugs now.
now we wait.
it's not working.
increase the doses.
5, 000 milligrams of Neurontin, 2,000 elavil.
sir, are you really...
only those who risk going too far find out how far they can go.
do it.
Oh, hell!
her heart rate is 183. Blood pressure is falling.
I told you not to touch anything.
I went somewhere.
to a gift shop. There was...A boy.
it worked!
she crossed over.
makes sense now, doesn't it?
why they needed you to take their test voluntarily.
why they needed you to believe that you were their Olivia.
they know you can cross over.
you've done it before.
that's how you ended up here in the first place.
mom. Hey.
come in.
it's Tuesday.
lunch.
I'm sorry. It just slipped my mind.
it's just been really hectic and...
Yeah. You know.
Frank does most of the real cleaning around here.
he's still away.
he's still in north Texas
trying to put a stop to that smallpox outbreak, so...
is everything okay?
mom, I'm just tired,
and I keep seeing...
I knew a pair of twins in High School...
Nina and Gina.
one of them was always so much brighter than the other one,
but they both managed to get straight as.
I'll give you one guess how they did that.
Olivia. - Yeah.
I asked you when is he coming back in town?
mom, I've gotta go.
um...I'm sorry.
do you mind if you... if you let yourself out?
sir?
Uh...They switched.
who? - The twins.
when we spoke to Matthew Rose today,
when he was talking about Joshua's crimes,
he wasn't angry or... or upset.
he was...Ashamed.
i-it wasn't like he was embarrassed.
it was more like he was guilty.
you think Joshua Rose was pretending to be his brother.
I think the man we spoke to today committed those crimes.
I think that they switched on us.
what is this about?
identical twins have the same DNA.
but fingerprints and retinas are unique.
he's who he says he is. He's Matthew rose.
no. Something's not right.
Dunham, it was just a hunch.
they switched again.
Liv... - I'll prove it to you.
you switched with your brother.
what are you talking about?
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Olivia. - Hang on.
okay, we went to your house yesterday.
what did we talk about?
what?
at your house.
what... Did we talk about?
your partner did most of the talking.
I told you how hard it was for me and my family when Joshua was robbing banks.
he told him.
what we looked like, what we talked about.
they're in this together. His brother told him.
Dunham. - They're messing with us. They switched.
outside.
he's lying. And you can't prove that I'm wrong.
we can't prove you're right either.
Liv... - they're twins.
are you telling me that it's not in the realm of possibility that they took each other's place?
look, even if you're right, we can't hold him on a hunch.
Colonel, you've got a visitor upstairs.
Colonel broyles, I'm not sure if you remember me.
of course, Mrs. Dunham.
what can I do for you?
Olivia would be furious with me, but...
I think she went back to work too soon.
she just hasn't been herself and...
I'm worried that there's something wrong.
you okay?
I mean, that depends. Do you believe me?
break-in at Langdon chemical two weeks ago.
guess what they stole? - Three tanks of ferrocene.
who uses ferrocene again?
so Joshua Rose is planning another heist.
uh... sir.
Lee, go check it out. Take Francis.
Oh...D-don't do this to me.
please don't take me off the case.
I think you've been pushed too hard.
go. - Sir, I'm not crazy.
I know I'm right about this. - Dunham...
if I could just follow it through, I...
Dunham...Go home.
how'd it go? - They know.
one of the agents, she knows, man.
she knows it was you who spoke to her at the house and we switched.
but they let you go?
Matty, are you being followed?
I don't see anyone.
you wouldn't see anybody. That's the point.
what are we gonna do?
just, um...
run some errands.
go get a cup of tea.
just don't come home yet. I need a couple of hours.
I'll take care of this.
how? - Just do what I said.
wasn't supposed to be like this. They weren't supposed to be this close.
look, I'm doing my best here... you know that.
well, he told me.
he was aware of every moment.
his mind was stuck in the last thought he had Before he was trapped.
this horrible feeling of fear...and loss.
wondering about his family, how we would get along.
can you imagine that?
I have a plan.
Oh. What? You gonna Rob a bank?
one last score to get lost and stay lost, Joshua?
if you really cared about him, you would turn yourself in,
because that is the only way out of this.
Oh, nice goal!
agent Farnsworth, Would you mind taking a look at something for me?
if Joshua Rose was about to hit another bank,
where would it be, given his profile and m. O?
I ran that scenario for Agent Lee an hour ago.
I understand, but would you mind taking another look for me?
there are 37 likely targets based on that criteria.
okay, what assumptions did you make?
assuming that Joshua Rose was taken out of Amber,
necessary parameters would include a subterranean vault, a minimum of $50, 000, - Proper getaway routes... - wait... sorry.
assuming that Joshua was removed from the Amber?
we know that he was taken out of the Amber.
we know that someone was taken from the Amber.
Joshua's a twin.
there's a 50% chance that his brother was in Amber
and that Joshua broke him out.
and Joshua is a brilliant criminal
with expertise in breaking into impenetrable areas.
Matthew is an accountant.
Yes.
okay, so if it was Matthew who was in the Amber,
then Joshua's m. O. may have changed.
I don't follow your logic.
okay. I think I spoke to Joshua yesterday.
he was clearly ashamed.
I mean, if he spent the past four years
living with the guilt of trapping his brother in Amber,
then he's not gonna want to hurt people like that again.
less human traffic. A remote area.
reduced collateral damage.
that would narrow the list of likely targets down to three...three banks.
anomalous energy signature detected.
class two breach.
Where's the location?
parameters match events from 2006.
79% probability it was caused by Joshua rose.
I need a location.
riverdale mutual. The Bronx.
let's go, people.
she was right.
who?
agent Dunham.
I want science and risk reports now!
that's Olivia's car.
chief!
molecular degradation is increasing.
we're looking at a 200-meter quarantine.
set a perimeter. - Best way in is through the main entrance.
I want three canisters in the main lobby.
we got a busted lock on a subway gate.
she could be down there.
she could be anywhere.
the quarantine protocol's already in place.
sir, if she's in there... - it's a class two breach.
we have to seal it before we lose this whole block.
five minutes. Give us five minutes.
you got three.
warning. Quarantine protocol imminent.
warning. Quarantine protocol imminent.
what are you doing here?
I found the blueprints.
realized what you're up to, and I can't let you do this again.
all right, we gotta move.
okay. Wait. Joshua Rose is in there...
we gotta go!
we gotta go!
Matt, you gotta leave. There's no time for this. You gotta go right now.
you don't need the money!
where are your tools?
unless they think they have me, they'll never stop.
there's no other way.
if I turn myself in, they'll figure it out...
they'll know I wasn't the one in the Amber.
they'll take you.
you're the only person alive that survived the quarantine.
they'll experiment on you for the rest of your life.
you know that.
Matty... Matt, you gotta go.
I'm not taking your life twice.
Josh...No...
let me do this one good thing.
quarantine protocol complete.
one casualty. Joshua Rose.
let's clean up and go home.
Dunham, you hang back.
are you aware of how many protocols you broke?
good work.
thank you, colonel.
hello.
we found your brother.
and I'm sorry to say he was caught in a quarantine protocol last night.
where?
riverdale mutual. In the Bronx.
he was attempting to break in.
well, thank you for telling me...Agent.
I'm sorry.
true or false? I take this to my lab, get them to run this skin sample,
they'd tell me this was from the man who spent the past four years in Amber.
Hey, dad, mom needs you to stick the steaks on the grill.
okay, buddy.
have a good day.
and...you can consider this investigation closed.
you know why you let him go, don't you?
it's beause you can understand what he's going through.
trapped in that Amber.
it's just like you're trapped over here.
only difference is...
nobody's going to save you.
only you can save yourself.
you listened to me about the case.
I don't understand why you won't listen to me about this.
why do you refuse to believe who you are?
why do you want to deny the truth about yourself?
you know, you can't prove anything that you're saying.
but I know things.
you're in my head.
exactly. Which means you know things too.
things about the other side.
things you couldn't possibly know unless you'd been there.
unless you were from there.
like what?
on the other side, the twin towers have fallen.
on the other side, your sister Rachel is still alive.
she lives in Chicago. Her husband took a job there.
they live at 1934 Sherman...
see, now I know you're lying, - Because Rachel hates Chicago. - Your beautiful niece Ella is alive.
she was born, and it's her birthday today.
she turns seven.
there's no way to prove it.
Yes, there is.
I wanna go back in the tank.
you're not scheduled for another test until tomorrow.
anything new?
no.
but something interesting.
about 20 minutes ago,
her brain chemistry spiked.
it seems there's some dormant chemical in her brain.
hmm. Some sort of synthetic compound.
from the way it's bound to her neurons,
I'd say it's been there since she was a child.
Hello?
Hi.
aunt Liv? You wouldn't forget my birthday.
aunt Liv?
what happened?
it didn't work.
nothing happened. All I saw was black.
agent lee? Olivia dunham.
what division are you in?
I am not leaving here without some answers.
sometimes answers...Lead to more questions.
the timeline has been rewritten.
he was erased, and yet traces of him continue to bleed through.
there was a man in the mirror!
he was here, and then he was gone. I saw him!
what's with the redecoration?
I'm here, walter. Right here.
please, help me.
you didn't answer my question.
I asked if you've been keeping up with the new medication I prescribed for you.
Yes. For the most part.
with my own modifications, of course.
Why?
well, you just seem a little bit distracted.
well, yes... As you ask.
you've come at an extremely inopportune time.
I'm in the middle of some very important work, and I'm anxious to resume.
I appreciate that, walter.
but these monthly evaluations are also important.
well, yes, I know. It was a condition you imposed on my release from st. Claire's.
I mean personally important.
you were under my care there for...Most of your 17 years.
these sessions allow me to catch up with you, see how you're doing.
now...
I've been perusing the latest observational reports from the agents assigned to you, and they mention certain patterns of unusual behavior.
well, o-occasionally, I have a unique way of doing things which can be misinterpret...
tell me about the mirrors.
mirrors? - And the television?
virtually every reflective surface in and around your lab has been covered or obscured by you.
naturally, I covered them up.
I - it's an experiment i'm conducting on...
so this had nothing to do with your lab being haunted.
beg your pardon?
a man no one else has seen, and that sometimes...
the man speaks to you.
just minor hallucinations, of course, by my self-medication.
that was weeks ago. I - I'm much better now.
so you haven't had any more of these hallucinations since?
no.
Walter, it is important that you be completely honest with me so that I can make an assessment of your state of mind and I can make recommendations for your continued care...
whatever that may be.
you're dead, sneddon. You hear me?
you better run, rat!
we're gonna beat your ass!
keep up. We got him now. He went in there. Oh, he's like so dead.
there he is.
picked a bad place to hide, dumb ass.
just leave me alone, guys.
or what?
I know it was you, you little freak.
you got me busted for the stash in my locker.
come on, matt. Kick his ass.
you had this coming...
something touched my leg!
it's probably just a bug or something. Tough it out.
dude, what is this? what the hell is this?
working a case?
something like that.
I got, uh, word you wanted to see me?
we get any news on the shape shifter attack?
uh, no. I just wanted to check in with you, see how you're handling everything.
I know you've been going through the case files, getting up to speed.
I understand that it can be kind of overwhelming.
it's hard when what you knew or what you thought you knew about the world.
no longer holds.
and I just wanted you to know that I'm here.
you're... Here?
Yeah.
to talk to, you know?
I mean, just if things are getting a little too much or if you're freaked out...
I'm... Not freaked out.
good.
okay. Well, you just let me know.
if I freak out, I...
Yeah, you... You'll be the first to know.
we've got two bodies. 12-year-old boys.
how many months since they've been missing?
not months. Hours.
agent broyles? agent farnsworth is ready for you.
has Dr. Bishop come up with any theories yet on cause of death or the bodies' advanced state of decomposition?
Walter, agent broyles wants to know if.
Yes, yes, I heard him.
that it is absurd for me to make any determination without first examining the remainders!
okay, walter said he...
tell him, for all I know, it could be viral or a mutation of some flesh-eating bacteria.
he thinks that... - Some kind of alien parasite or...
Bigfoot. Bigfoot! That's it.
Astrid, perhaps you can look around for massive fecal droppings, he doesn't have any theories, sir.
I think I got something.
there's a third set of sneaker treads leading in...
and then out. Size 7, 8,maybe.
then we have a potential witness.
or another victim.
even if there was another boy that got away, he could still be infected by whatever killed the other two.
point taken. We need to find him fast.
Yeah. If he's alive.
remarkably pungent stench.
I'm gonna... Get some scented candles.
agent broyles.
it was good of you to accompany astrid, although unnecessary.
agents dunham and lee are tracking down the identity of the boy who fled the scene.
I thought I'd take the opportunity to check in on you.
how nice. May I ask why?
you had your evaluation with Dr. Sumner last night.
he called me afterwards to voice some concerns.
concerns?
he thought you seemed unusually agitated by something you were reluctant to confide.
I - I can't imagine what gave him that impress...
Where's the second body?
on its way to the morgue.
I assumed one was sufficient for your examination.
not... Not sufficient at all.
I - it's quite the opposite. I need both bodies.
Walter. - what?
what?
did you say something?
I asked why you need both bodies.
because... - walter, listen to me.
Walter, do you see me?
only by... Comparison... Will I be able to determine...
if there are patterns to the decomposition of the tissue...
or the putrefaction of the internal organs, it may well be that the victims perished at different intervals.
Dr. Bishop. - And one of them may be a carrier!
I want to come home. - I am not losing my mind!
I would appreciate you arranging to have the second remains sent here as soon as possible.
excuse me.
we have a lead on the third boy. This morning another student told the principal that the two victims had been talking about plans to beat a kid up.
his name is aaron sneddon. He's ten years old.
he said it was pretty dark and he didn't see much after the boys chased him into the tunnel.
why didn't he tell anyone what happened? His parents?
well, he has no father, and his mother is out of the country.
aaron said that she's away a lot for work.
but the boy's mother wouldn't leave him home by himself.
no, she has him stay with a neighbor in their apartment complex.
his principal said that he's a quiet boy, that she doesn't know him to have many friends.
so has walter gotten anywhere yet?
beyond his random theories of vampires and succubi, no.
he says he needs to examine the other body.
I'd like you and agent lee to retrieve it from the morgue.
I'll let Dr. Bishop know the boy is here. - Okay.
you like to draw?
me too.
aaron, we're going to have to get you checked out to make sure that you're okay.
our friend, Dr. Bishop, is going to examine you.
I don't like doctors.
they scare me.
Oh, you'll like walter.
there's nothing scary about him.
all right, young man.
let's get started. Take off your shirt and hop on the table.
please, I don't want a shot.
well, technically a shot is depositing a substance into the bloodstream.
this is more a withdrawal.
just this one time.
I promise.
there. That wasn't so bad.
good boy.
you can put your shirt on now.
I'll be right back.
please, don't touch that!
give me...
it's all right. It's all right.
I... I shouldn't have shouted.
it... It belonged to my son.
you have a son?
I did.
he died.
Walter. You need to come and take a look at this.
what is it?
it happened when I was moving a candle.
that's curious.
look at the lambda sensor.
the corpse is pulling high levels of oxygen out of the air.
I don't remember there being this much mold on the ribcage before.
dear god.
the incubation case. Quickly!
grab the other end. We have to contain it.
Walter. - No time to explain. Hurry!
spores.
I... I had assumed that the mold was just a symptom of the rapid decomposition.
Walter, I am not following. - The cause, astrid...
I'm starting to believe that it was an aggressive form of fungi that killed the boys.
Olivia and lincoln, they went to the morgue to get the other body.
Astrid? - Are you at the morgue?
Yeah, we're just heading to the elevator now...
listen, you have got to evacuate the room.
get the body from the tunnel locked down.
what? - It's going to explode and release spores!
you gonna get that?
I'm eating my lunch.
come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, beth, come here. Take a look at this.
Oh, god.
we gotta get them out of there. - We can't open that door.
we need to get a team in here and lock down the area.
we can't just leave 'em to die.
they're already dead.
Dr. Bishop. Can you tell us what we're dealing with here?
clearly not the garden variety of cordyceps fungi.
a genetic mutation with a capacity of hyper-accelerated growth and nutrition absorption, which explains the rapid decomposition of the bodies.
Walter, what's "cordyceps fungi"?
a species capable of releasing neurotoxins so as to paralyze a host, usually an insect, so that the fungi can feed and lay its spores.
so why aren't they attacking us?
these are not a pack of wolves, agent broyles.
size not withstanding, they are still a lower life form with rudimentary instincts probably based on tactile response.
as long as none of you touch them, they won't even know you're there.
a couple of these bad boys are making their way down the sink.
most likely seeking more water and nutrients, which shows a strong impulse to expand their reach as far as possible.
I mean, really, this is a most extraordinary species, don't you think?
admiration aside, dr. Bishop, how do you recommend killing these things?
as with a great many molds and fungi, a strong dose of u. v.Light or intense heat should effectively eradicate them.
understood.
agent mace, this is broyles.
we're going to need high-intensity u. v.Lamps in here, as many as you can find.
Yes, sir. Copy that.
I'll oversee things here.
I want you and agent lee to assemble a small team and have them meet you at the tunnel.
based on the boy's remains, the fungus colony at the tunnel is probably much bigger than what we have here.
I'm not convinced that u. v. Is the most efficient way to destroy it.
you have something else in mind?
I'm thinking flamethrowers.
fortunately, your tests show no sign of fungal infection.
the good news is that you're now free to return home.
agent farnsworth will drop you there.
unless it's not good news.
nobody's there.
Oh, yes. I understand you're staying with a friend.
a neighbor, but she never talks to me.
perhaps there's someone else with whom you can stay.
no. - I see.
well, I certainly know what it feels like to have nowhere to go, no family.
this is the only home I know.
you live here?
Yeah. It's not much, I admit, but...
it's certainly better than the mental institution where I lived before this.
would you like to stay here with me for a little while longer?
I can't promise that i'll have any time for entertaining you, understand.
I mean, i'm a very busy man.
sublime.
Dr. Bishop. - "walter.
I said you could call me "walter.
how did your son die?
Peter was very sick.
I tried for a long time to find a cure...
but I found it too late, and he died.
then I discovered an alternate universe where another version of my son was dying from the same malady.
so I crossed over to the other side with the intention of bringing him back to cure him.
and peter... The other version of him... Drowned.
and I lost him all over again.
and... You don't think you belong in a mental institution?
how soon till the flood lights are up?
almost there, ma'am.
here's our perp.
doesn't look like much in here.
no wonder we overlooked it.
well, once we've got lights, we can make sure we've taken out the entire colony.
ready for you, agent dunham.
I don't know about you, but I'm ready for another.
aaron, what's wrong?
it's... Bright.
what? It's too bright.
what do you see?
I need the handheld flood over here.
there's more of it back here.
a lot more.
what is that?
let me take a look... - No! Get away!
what is it?
some of it's growing down through some grating.
do we know what's under here?
burn it. Burn it all.
Astrid! Help me!
aaron, you need to talk to me. You need to tell me what's wrong.
Walter, he has a high-grade fever. How'd this happen?
I don't know. He was complaining about something being too bright, and then he got scared, and then he just started burning...
stop what you're doing.
say it again. - I said stop it! You're killing the boy.
just a few more minutes. I don't want to turn you into a popsicle.
Oh, astrid... - I'll get you one later, walter.
grape, please. And one for my friend here.
you just rest there.
Olivia. We've managed to bring his temperature down a couple of degrees, but it remains dangerously high.
and you're positive that aaron was affected by the fungus in the tunnel?
his collapse and fever coincided precisely as you were, uh, burning the colony.
I am certain there was a connection.
okay, what about the fungus at the morgue?
Broyles and his team destroyed that.
why wasn't aaron affected then?
well, that I cannot explain as of yet.
so the boy is feeling whatever this thing inside the tunnel is feeling.
precisely.
okay, whatever it is, it's dangerous, and we need to destroy it.
so how do we break the connection between it and the boy?
I'm not sure, but perhaps the best way to determine that is to learn how the connection was formed in the first place.
okay, well, I think I may have an idea about that.
aaron, let's have a talk.
about what?
about why you lied to us.
your drawings, aaron.
agent dunham found them covering the wall inside the tunnel.
you never mentioned you'd been there before yesterday.
based on the size of your artwork, i'd say you go there a lot.
it, um...
it's hard to explain.
I would go there sometimes.
to get away.
and after a while, I would...
start to feel better, like I wasn't alone, that there was something there that was sad whenever I was sad.
or... I know it sounds stupid.
perhaps not.
you're saying you thought there was something there that felt as you felt.
I mean, I guess I thought I was just imagining it.
maybe I was crazy.
but it was like it understood me, - like it wanted to protect... - Protect you.
aaron, the boys who were chasing you...
you intentionally led them there, didn't you?
it told you to bring them back to the tunnel.
I didn't know what was gonna happen, I swear.
I didn't know what it was!
it's all right, son.
I believe you did nothing wrong.
what was that all about? I don't understand.
I think I'm beginning to.
I need agent dunham.
my initial hypothesis was entirely wrong.
these are not colonies of fungi.
I now believe that...That this is a single organism, one with rapidly evolving communication skills, enabling it to form a psychic bond with the boy.
you see these?
I believe that each of these fungal masses is the equivalent to a neuron, a brain cell, and these tendrils are linking them together, essentially dendrites and synapses.
the organism is a vast neural network.
wait, you're telling me that this whole thing, all of it, is one big giant brain?
that's exactly what I'm saying.
agent lee, gus is a growing, evolving mind.
well, I thought that since it's a single living entity that perhaps we should name it for the sake of clarity.
okay, so the reason that aaron wasn't affected when we destroyed the fungi in the morgue...
was because the colony growing there was unable to connect to the network, and until it could, it was a mindless appendage.
that's why it was heading down the drain...to try and connect with gus.
Yeah. What you need to understand is that gus can only make more of itself.
and as it grows, it becomes more intelligent, more self-aware, and ever more conscious of how alone in the world it is.
and my contention is that gus forged a link with aaron over this shared sense of isolation.
until I can find a way to break the link with the boy, any assault on the organism will hurt him.
or worse.
it's broyles.
sir, we have new information about the fungus.
so have i. There's been another attack...
a homeless man camped out in an alley in roxbury crossing.
looks like the fungus came up through some grating.
Roxbury? That's six miles from the tunnel.
I know.
after agent lee's report on the growths in the tunnel,
I found that the boston sewer line runs directly underneath that area.
we have a major infestation on our hands.
we need to eradicate this thing, and we need to do it now.
agent broyles, uh, this is walter bishop. I... I don't think you.
you... You understand that I haven't yet discovered a way to break the link between the organism and the boy.
I... I need more time. - I do understand, doctor. Believe me.
but the longer we wait, the more likely other innocent people will be killed.
it's just that you are not hearing me.
I suggest you keep trying with whatever time...
he'll die! Do you hear me?
you're going to kill peter!
Walter, you mean "aaron.
what did I say?
you've got two hours, dr. Bishop.
after that or if there are any more attacks, I can't make any promises.
Astrid, we need to reconfigure the neurostimulator for magnetic resonance!
we need to chart aaron's brain activity.
agent dunham, you and agent lee, be ready to move out.
Yes, sir.
flamethrowers aren't going to be enough. We're gonna need some help.
I've got recon team throughout the city, spread out over an eight-mile radius.
so far we've determined the fungus has encroached on at least a dozen populated buildings, all of which have been evacuated.
but no other bodies have been found.
thankfully, no.
it's been well over an hour. How's Dr. Bishop doing with the boy?
we haven't gotten any word yet.
agent broyles, if you don't mind my asking, what exactly is our plan to kill gus?
that's what walter's calling the organism.
that's our plan, agent lee, compliments of nina sharp and massive dynamic.
you two, along with one of their techs, will be administering a potent toxin to the fungus.
agent broyles, recon six is on the line.
I'm gonna check in with walter.
Walter. It's olivia.
Olivia, we've managed to isolate gus' brain wave.
the link appears to be centered somewhere inside of aaron's pre-frontal lobe.
okay, so you know how to disconnect it.
Oh, no. No, I haven't quite worked that out yet.
okay, walter, we're running out of time.
I realize that.
my attempts to shut down that part of his brain haven't worked!
there's only one other possible option.
surgically remove the infected part.
what are you saying? you're thinking of lobotomizing him?
I don't know what else to do in the time I have left, olivia.
Walter, you can't!
I have to save his life. Whatever it takes.
okay, walter, listen to me.
now, you're gonna find another way, and I'm gonna talk to broyles, explain the situation to him, and see if I can buy us some time. Stand by.
sir. - I just got word from one of our teams.
the fungus has reached a subway platform in midtown.
we can't contain this thing. We have to move on it now.
you gave walter two hours. There's still time...
I'm sorry, but you know as well as I do we can't sacrifice countless other lives to save one boy.
what?
no time to talk. I have to think.
so what are we looking for?
somewhere the toxin will be best distributed.
some sort of central mass.
there.
agent broyles, we've located the injection point.
the tech is preparing the toxin.
copy that. Keep me apprised.
I was told it was on your order.
okay.
No!
Walter, his blood pressure is falling, and he has lost consciousness.
do something!
I've run through every conceivable scenario I can think of.
that creature has a hold on his brain, and I have no ide...
wait. Wait!
what's happening in there?
the toxin's been administered, but the technician is dead.
I want you and agent lee to fall back to position one now!
lincoln, what? - I can't move.
what?
the source of aaron's physical distress isn't isolated in the pre-frontal lobe, as I thought.
it's also here.
what is that? - It's the limbic system.
Limbic! The emotional center of the brain.
emotion...
Yes. Astrid, get me the epinephrine.
the fungus has a hold on agent lee.
he requires immediate medical help.
we're assembling a team now.
does the fungicide appear to be working?
negative. The organism's still alive.
I don't know why, but it's not working.
the link is emotional. Gus doesn't have a hold on him.
he has a hold on it.
I'm sorry, son.
Aaron! Aaron! Listen to me!
Aaron! Aaron! Good boy, good boy.
I know you're scared, but you need to let go of the organism.
no... It's my friend. I'll be alone.
I know you've come to believe that it's your friend, but it's not real.
it's something that's invaded your mind. It's hurting you.
nobody cares. It doesn't matter.
Walter, his blood pressure is still falling. His organs are shutting down.
you matter to me.
I care, and I... And I don't want to lose you.
I can't lose you. Not again.
Aaron...I know how hard it is to make connections.
I know what it is to be lonely.
it takes courage to be the one to take someone else's hand, to trust that they won't leave you.
I won't leave you, aaron.
and I'm begging you not to leave me. Please.
let it go. Let it go.
please. Let it go, son.
walter...i think it's working.
he's stabilizing.
this is dunham.
uh, something's happening.
their brain waves have separated.
it's gone.
Gus is gone.
it's working!
the organism's dying.
okay... We need a medical team down here now!
lincoln, can you hear me?
it's okay. It's okay.
you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be fine.
you look a little freaked out.
you wanna talk about it?
you take him.
no, he's yours.
he'd be better off with you. Toys are meant to be played with.
Yeah, I've seen the movie with the talking toys.
oddly disturbing.
okay, aaron, we gotta get you to the hospital, or they're gonna give your room away to somebody who's really sick.
aren't you coming too?
well, I very much wish I could...
but I have things I need to do.
we'll see each other again soon, I promise.
Astrid told me the good news about aaron.
I knew you'd figure...
it's all right. The area is completely numb.
I... I know exactly what I'm doing.
just let me do this.
just gonna put the hammer down.
Walter... What the hell were you thinking?
I don't want to be recommitted.
I can't go back there.
please don't send me back.
what are you talking about?
I'm going insane.
I've been having hallucinations.
no matter what I do, they won't stop.
what kind of hallucinations, walter?
for weeks now. I was afraid to tell anyone.
what are you seeing?
it doesn't matter.
just tell me.
a person. A young man.
his voice is in my head, saying peculiar things.
does he look like this?
where did you get this?
I drew it from memory.
I've been seeing him in my dreams for the past three weeks.
and all this time...
I thought I was losing my mind, that he was a figment of my psychosis.
I'm perfectly sane!
here.
who is he?
I don't know.
I've been running facial recognition through interagency databases, including interpol, but nothing's shown up.
a shared vision like this...
he must be real!
and if he's real...
we have to find him.
there is an alternate universe, and in it, another version of us.
agent Farnsworth? - Broyles, Phillip, Colonel.
that woman processes more information in an hour than you and I will in a lifetime.
37 people in the intersection. 22 cars, 4 trucks, 2 buses.
wind speeds of 5 to 10 miles an hour, and that is just to start.
they kidnapped Olivia to the other side.
for weeks, that awful woman pranced around my lab.
she's evil. She's a temptress. And I fell right into her vagenda.
Vagenda"?
is that an observer? - Is that what you call him?
they are not limited by our human perception of time.
I think these guys show up at important moments.
we've been looking at these people for three years.
why did he make contact now?
Malignant? - But it's small, and it's the early days.
and with radiation, this type of carcinoma is 95% treatable.
95% survivable, Chet.
that's better odds than you got driving up the Mass Pike.
I've known you what, 20 years?
we're going to get through this.
tissue connectivity. That's what goes last.
I'm sorry?
first, there's the cure-- Radiation.
it makes you sick, weak. But it doesn't work.
not this time, not in your case.
the cancer has multiplied.
they try chemo, but the cell replication rate is just too high.
your bones hurt. They ache. They burn.
renal failure comes next.
and soon, you lose all mobility below the waist.
impotence, incontinence, and finally, full respiratory failure.
all from one... Tiny mole.
doctor told me I have a 95% chance.
you're the other 5%.
initiate scan.
welcome, Agent.
fringe DIVISION, NEW YORK - You wanted to see us, Colonel? - The bridge was activated an hour ago.
an agent crossed over to the other side without any mission imperative.
who was it? - Are you suggesting that somebody defected?
I can't imagine. It was Agent Farnsworth.
that's impossible. Who-- who gave her clearance?
she did. Agent Farnsworth has the same security clearance as any Senior Fringe Agent.
in fact, she's responsible for processing transit papers and clearance. It just never occurred to us
that she would use it for herself. - Correct.
what's she doing over there? - We don't know.
she went off the grid immediately after crossing over.
all right. Let's send a team of agents to retrieve her.
no, she must've had a reason.
Astrid doesn't do anything without a reason, and after the day she's had,
I got a hunch where she's headed. I'll go get her.
harvard UNIVERSITY
what would you say to some eggs?
I had a marvelous dream last night in which eggs played a prominent part.
I would say... That we've only been working for three hours, and we've already taken two food breaks.
at this rate, I'll never get home.
I miss the other one.
I'm almost afraid to ask. - Boy. The other boy. He doesn't starve me.
which other boy? - The one who plays chess.
Lincoln? - That's the one. I prefer him.
well, Lincoln's not here, Walter. He's in Hartford. It's his goddaughter's birthday. Remember?
and I'd be happy to play with you after we finish our work.
frankly, I don't think you'd be much of a challenge.
I got a challenge for ya. Why don't we fix the machine?
hello. - Hello.
how about you and I share some delightful scrambled eggs, Astro?
it's Astrid.
that's funny. You never correct me.
you're not you, are you?
I don't think what he meant was "I'll call you.
I think what he meant was "I'll never call you.
hello.
what happened? - I always wondered why nobody does that.
what are you doing here, Agent?
I came here to meet her.
Hi.
hello.
Olivia told me about you.
but it's nice to meet you personally in the flesh.
all personal meetings are in the flesh.
Yes, I-I suppose they are.
I thought I would come here.
I didn't know where to go after.
mother might have had traditions for such occasions, but I don't know. I don't remember her.
my mother died of cancer when I was a girl. Did yours as well?
Yes.
at first I thought I would walk in the park.
but it was so cold.
and I could not stop thinking about the words Reverend Stewart said.
what a leader he was, a great man, a great friend.
Reverend Stewart said he would be sorely missed.
and they lowered the box down into the ground, and we put down flowers.
and I didn't know where to go.
because the park was so cold.
may I ask you a question?
yours-- Did you love him?
what's going on?
I think my f
I-I think her father is dead.
perhaps y-you would both like to join me in a plate of eggs. W-with chives.
Walter, now is not the time.
nonsense. N-nearly all cultures react to death with food.
okay, uh, we just caught a case.
and my double's on her way here to-- To sort this out.
Olivia! The viper?
Walter. - What? I know. Detente.
that's not to say I have to like her.
do you think that one of us should wait here with
no, there's no need. We will be fine. Astrid and I
Really? You get her name right.
Astrid and I can wait here alone, can't we, dear?
I'm sure she'll be great company.
Boston Police found the body at 9: 30 this morning.
he was coming home from his doctor's office.
less than six hours ago, Chet Williams was diagnosed with stage I melanoma.
stage one. That has a survival rate of 95%.
and that's without introducing even one frog rectally to slow cell division.
what? - What?
nothing.
so what are these? Bad mascara day?
I'd say bad day all around. I mean, can-- can someone actually cry blood?
rarely.
certain viruses-- Ebola, say-- Can cause bleeding from the tear ducts, but only after most of the organs are liquefied. Check his crotch.
I'm-- I'm sorry? - Don't be a prude.
Oh, you-- you see? There's no bleeding from the urethra.
so I would say his organs are not liquefied.
okay, good news. Walter says that his organs haven't liquefied.
so then what else could cause this?
nothing. Nothing real, at least.
there is a-a legendary alchemical mixture-- A-a potion, as it were
called The Tears Of Ra.
egyptians used it to euthanize beloved pets so that they could be buried with their owners who pre-deceased them.
but it's just a myth.
well, bring the body back to the lab.
and-- and also, I'd like some vanilla ice cream.
Kirk out.
you talk through her.
you're Astrid. You talk through her. As if you were one person.
Yes, you could say it that way.
it must be pleasant.
Yes. I suppose it is.
Thanks. You can follow us back to the lab.
Yeah. All right, keep me posted.
right.
I think we have located it.
0. 26 pounds. 17% lighter than an average human kidney.
okay, Chet Williams. 38 years old.
manufactures consumer goods overseas.
uh, single... No debt...
no drug issues. His friends say that he's a nice guy.
so nobody someone would want to kill?
well, everybody has somebody who wants to kill them.
and voila. The deadly culprit reveals itself.
odd.
always makes me nervous when he says that.
an interaction of chemical compounds I've not seen before. Aspirin...
predictive sciences says that these compounds shouldn't interact, but they do.
so what, you're saying that it's magic?
it's science. Just unusual science. Huh.
the way that six different alcohols create a flavor identical to iced tea.
Amen to that.
it works, but no one could've predicted it would work.
so you're saying that he was killed by a poison that no one invented.
it should go without saying, but that's impossible.
I think we're aware of that, Peter.
Oh. Isn't this a party? Hey, girls.
mata Hari. Deceived and betrayed anyone yet today?
it is almost lunchtime, after all.
the Hand of God?
the interaction of the chemicals in the poison is not predictable.
the creation of the toxin requires the assumption that these compounds can intermingle, and in fact, these compounds do not intermingle
except when they are all mixed together, they do, which is a completely unpredictable event.
okay, just so I'm clear-- you're saying that a person would have to
see that the chemicals had already been combined in order to know how to combine them?
Yes, and the chances of that occurring randomly are less than 0. 10%.
therefore, there is a root of the equation that is outside our realm of causality, deus ex machina, the hand of God.
but Astrid, are you trying to tell us that God taught our perp how to mix a mythical poison?
God... Or godlike powers.
it-- It's the only thing that makes sense.
come with me. I'll need your help to identify the origin of these component compounds.
I think I love her.
okay, well, I guess that, uh, we're not gonna go straight home.
cold Chinese in the fridge?
uh, yeah. I'll check.
gin
here you go.
you're putting up a good fight.
but you're not going to win.
you're gonna take that drink, and from there it's all downhill.
but you know the saddest part?
the drinking doesn't kill you.
instead, it shatters the lives of everyone around you. Everyone you love.
your boyfriend is going to be killed in a car accident with you behind the wheel.
your brother is going to alienate his wife and daughter, throw away his own future trying to rescue you. But he fails.
no one can see the future.
you're right. There is no future. There's no past.
everything happens right now.
now that you're back,
I can finally rid myself of this junk you left behind in your haste to slink away.
Walter, you've been holding onto this stuff all this time?
I didn't steal anything, if that's what you're implying.
although I admit that this one item confounded me.
just another of your tools of spy craft, I imagine.
a sinister communication device?
some kind of devious encoder?
Wow. I really got to you, didn't I, Walter?
did you ever consider that perhaps it's because you enjoyed having me around?
admit it. You like me, Walter.
Walter, we're setting up.
Dr. Bishop. Dr. Bishop, your Astrid is summoning you.
the Fringe team is at the scene.
the way this woman died-- And I say this with some experience
is among the weirdest things I've ever seen.
she bleeding from her eyes? - How did you know?
there seems to be a lot of that going around lately.
you mind opening it up? I'd love to take a look.
Astrix, collect a DNA sample.
Astrid, can you hand me a cotton swab?
hang on, Walter. - I wanna get a DNA sample.
so the cops said-- - Hang on a second.
seems to be some hemorrhaging of the nasal passage.
you think maybe she inhaled something?
Yeah, possibly. Could be how they delivered the poison.
I'm sorry, Walter. What were you saying?
doesn't matter.
but please ask Agent Dunham to bring the body
Astrid, we're gonna need to get this body back to the lab to have it examined.
can you work that out with the ME's office? - Yeah.
does he always do all the jobs?
these scalpels could use some sharpening.
and you're sharing that with me why?
I thought you'd sharpen them for me. You said you wanted to help.
I had meant with the autopsy, Walter.
the screws in the rib-spreader could also use a little tightening.
you're angry with your son.
he is not my son.
as I understand it, in a different timeline, he is.
Oh, so he says.
do you feel love for him?
I have found that anger inevitably seems to be conjoined with emotional investment.
do you think that is the case?
Peter is a reminder of the son I had... And wish had lived.
but he is not that son.
and that makes you suffer?
Yes.
in that case, wouldn't it be preferable if you chose to believe he was your son?
and then you could love him and be happy.
I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing any connection between the victims.
secretary's son. He's cute, huh?
bet he's all contradictory and tricky like his dad.
Yeah, I imagine he's just your type.
actually, no. Turns out I like the nice guys.
all right, so neither of the victims lived in the same neighborhood.
they didn't go to the same gym, and they got no mutual friends.
Yeah, well, there has to be a connection. We just haven't found it yet.
you say that with such conviction. Because...?
because if there isn't a link, then we've got a killer on the loose and no lead to find him.
have a nice flight.
look, honey, I'm at the security thing. I've gotta call you back, okay?
boarding PASS JARED/ COLIN MR - Have a nice flight. - Thanks.
back BAY, BOSTON
look, take it down a notch, okay?
Yeah, yeah, I want to get this over with, too.
what? No, no. It's not a ruse.
I told you, I missed the flight this morning. There's nothing I can do.
bill, Bill. Listen to me. I'm hanging up the phone right now.
call me back when you get a personality I can deal with.
can I help you?
making your next call will destroy your life.
excuse me? - You'll be driving. When a taxi cuts you off, your reaction won't be quick enough because you only have one hand on the wheel.
Oh, okay. Well, thanks, pal. But my life really is none of your business.
your car is going to flip, shattering your spinal cord.
you're left a paraplegic, and with no family, you end up in a group home.
the man who runs it is not...Kind.
your body will be discovered more than ten hours after you die.
no one mourns.
I'm going to spare you from all that misery.
a painless exit from a living nightmare.
Boston MEDICAL CENTER
apparently, his attacker tried to spray him with some kind of atomizer.
Yeah, that sounds like our guy.
he said he'd never seen the man before, so why? What's his motive?
hm. The feds, I take it?
too many years in this job. Lawyers and cops-- I can spot you guys a mile away.
uh, I'm Agent Olivia Dunham, and this is Peter Bishop.
what can you tell us about Mr. Colin, doctor?
well, it's not good news.
I mean, we saved his life, but his spinal cord is severed right below T1, so he is not gonna walk again.
come on. He's down here.
I wasn't even supposed to be in town.
I was heading down to Dallas.
selling my company to my scumbag partner, who for six years has made my life a living hell.
today was gonna be the day that I started over.
new beginning.
but I had a water bottle in my carry-on.
by the time the damn TSA was done with me, I missed my flight.
besides his description, is there anything else that you can tell us?
anything that you remember?
he, uh... He had this weird rod. It was blue.
and he'd look into it like he was some kind of fortune teller.
he said I was gonna have a car accident, and I was gonna end up like this.
so this guy predicted what would happen?
not exactly, but I guess exactly doesn't really matter now.
we think it's possible that the man who attacked you also killed at least another two people.
do you recognize either of them?
no.
he...
he said he wanted to put me out of my misery.
like he was doing a good deed.
like he was some kind of saint.
I tell ya, I wish he had.
I wish he'd done it. I wish he'd killed me.
nothing to link them.
period. Goose egg. Zilch. - Period. Goose egg. Zilch.
would you like a cup of coffee? I'm going to make a fresh pot.
coffee. I understand that has quite an interesting flavor.
Yeah, I suppose it does. Have you never had any?
where I come from, coffee is very rare and thus very expensive.
I've never had the privilege.
Yes, I would like that. Thank you, Astrid.
you're welcome, sweetie.
did you ask? I didn't hear you ask.
may I? - Certainly not.
that's right. You're still mad at me.
Yes, and now you're breaking my concentration as well.
Oh, I'm sorry.
were you solving world hunger or perfecting the perfect peanut butter milkshake?
if you must know, I was musing on our killer.
agent Dunham reports that he may be attempting to put his victims out of their misery, and if that's the case, then his murder weapon of choice is consistent.
the Tears of Ra? - Yes.
painless and instantaneous. And it begins to make sense now.
so we're looking for-- for what? A humanitarian killer?
or a compassionate one.
that sounds like an extremely contorted view of compassion.
some suffering is worse than death.
all three victims traveled through there.
is that right? How did you miss that?
I didn't. They all had different airlines. They had different destinations.
Mr. Williams was what, two weeks ago?
Carrie Watson was last month.
Yes, their travel vouchers indicate that. What is TSA?
uh, Transportation Security Administration. They screen every passenger for safety.
in that case, correlating their voucher stamps,
I believe they may each have been screened by the same security agent.
she's right. TSA badge 0047.
my.
thank you. Have a nice flight.
Hey. Stop that man!
Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop right there!
federal agents. We're in pursuit of a suspect.
federal regulations. You either have a boarding pass or supervised authorization.
do you want me to find you a supervisor?
massachusetts INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY
I was surprised the FBI was doing a background check on Neil.
well, to be honest, we were surprised to learn that he was previously employed as a professor at MIT.
Yeah, I could tell that on the phone.
so how does an advanced mathematics professor end up working for the TSA?
I suppose he loses his mind.
it would be an understatement to say that people around here are driven, but Neil-- He put 'em all to shame.
he was the youngest tenure track professor ever. Brilliant.
and a little bit mad to begin with, I suppose.
and like most mathematicians, he believed that math was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe.
I know how that sounds. - Not nearly as crazy as you might think.
well, a couple years ago, he came back from summer break at his lake house, and he was just...Changed.
he said that he'd found something, although he wouldn't say what.
but he'd become obsessed with these high-level differential equations that no one could make heads or tails of.
he had a theory that if he could solve the equations, space and time could be flattened, so they would all be on a level plane.
define that for me what do you mean by flattened?
well, that you could in essence see past, present, and future simultaneously.
well, eventually, solving the equations became more important than class, and soon, he just left and didn't come back.
now, from what I heard, he went back to the lake house. But this working at the TSA?
now, that surprises me.
where was that lake house?
I'm not sure, somewhere in eastern New York, I think. He wanted his mail forwarded.
Oh, here we are. Reiden Lake.
when you first appeared in this timeline, it was at Reiden Lake.
what's going on, Peter?
the professor said that Neil thought he could see past, present, and future all at the same time.
that's what the observers do. We've just never been able to figure out how they do it.
but in my timeline, an observer saved my life.
it also happened at Reiden Lake.
when Walter crossed over when I was a child to bring me back to his universe, the ice broke. We both fell in.
it was an observer who pulled us out.
are you suggesting that an observer is somehow behind this?
that-- that he's using Neil?
I don't know. I think we should take a drive.
what's he doing?
thinking.
you care for him.
I suppose I do, yeah.
like a father.
my father...
I cannot get the thought out of my mind that...
that I couldn't give him what he wanted because of the way that I am.
that he secretly wished I could love him back in a way that he could understand.
do you think if I were more like you, he would've loved me more?
if I was normal?
I think I would prefer this beverage with sugar.
who leaves their door unlocked when they're not home?
you're right. It's not safe.
well, we're in the right place.
Hey, take a look at this. Neil was a twin.
his brother and father were killed in an accident.
so Gandhi, Joan of Arc, all the rest of them-- What's the connection?
they're heroes?
what else do they all have in common?
they're all saviors.
so where is Neil?
where are you going?
I don't understand.
what do you mean, you are here to say good-bye?
where are you going? - I told you.
where I belong" is not an answer.
were you fired again?
I told you, mom. I wasn't fired from MIT. I left.
what?
I heard you that night, you know.
the night Alex died.
you said God took the wrong one.
why did God take my angel?" You kept saying.
you always resented that I wasn't Alex. Not your angel.
I was afraid that you were right.
that I would never be good enough. As good as he was.
but God had a plan.
he let me live for a reason. I know that now.
God gave me a way to see the future.
W-what are you talk-- - "What are you talking about?
stop. Don't do that. - Stop. Don't do that.
you're scaring me. - You're scaring me.
God gave me a way to see the future so I could give people mercy.
Neil... I'm sorry.
what you heard that night... About your brother...
you should never have heard that.
but I did. And I'm glad.
every time I saw the disapproving look in your eye, it drove me harder to separate myself through accomplishment.
that's why God took notice. Because of you.
Neil. Please stop this.
Jesus knew the romans were coming for him.
he could have avoided his death so easily. But he didn't.
he had faith that God had a plan.
I understand God's plan for me now. And I'm willing to go.
FBI. Open this door, or we're coming in!
FBI?
FBI. Put your hands up.
he said angels don't belong on Earth.
keep your hands where I can see them, and turn around very slowly.
I'll see you in heaven.
Agh! No!
No!
Hey, how you holding up?
you know, he wasn't trying to hit me. He fired at the window on purpose.
how do you know that?
I think he knew we were coming, and he wanted us to shoot him.
I guess it makes sense. I mean, he could see the past, present, and future.
but he had a gun. Why not just shoot himself?
because he was religious.
if he committed suicide, he wouldn't be allowed into heaven.
what about all the people he killed?
he thought he was saving them. This was his way to become an angel.
Peter, I know it's taken me some getting used to, but as long as you're stuck here, you make a good partner.
thank you.
Dr. Bishop, we are leaving.
Hey, Walter.
here, I want to show you something.
my ingenious piece of spy tech.
mints?
similar. They're bobbins. They're delicious.
it's almost like wintergreen. Only smokier.
one for the road. - Are you giving me a send-off?
you may possess positive qualities that I previously overlooked.
are you flirting with me?
in your dreams.
it was really nice meeting you.
it was amazing, actually.
Yes.
what you said before...
my father...
we're not very close either.
he's a very complex man.
he doesn't really show emotion.
he does the best with the tools he has.
that's just how he is.
I know he loves me.
at least, that's what I tell myself, even though it doesn't really seem that way.
you shouldn't regret that you could've been more for him.
it wasn't you.
thank you, Agent Farnsworth.
you're welcome, Agent Farnsworth.
Hey.
well, look who's here.
Hi, dad.
Ah. That kinda day, huh?
Yeah. That kind of a day.
wanna tell me about it?
Yes. But you know that I can't.
Yeah. I know.
but at least I can feed ya.
and I can give my baby girl a big ol' hug.
I love you, dad.
I love you too, Astrid.
here it is.
you're right. It's September's.
he must have lost it in 1985, the night he didn't save the boy.
he'll be interested to know what happened to it.
there's something else.
it appears that September did not obey your instructions.
the boy is back. Peter Bishop has returned.
clearly I'm in the wrong place, and all the people that I know and love are... Somewhere else.
you were showing up in my dreams.
how is that possible when I'd never even seen you before?
in the dreams, did you... Feel like you knew me? Did you feel anything?
you were a stranger, so what would I feel?
his name is David Robert Jones. He was looking for a mineral named Amphilocite.
if you know how to process it properly, it can be used as a power source.
with this stuff, you get a lot of bang for your buck.
well, how much bang are we talking? - Enough to blow a hole in the universe.
I love you.
do you love me?
I do.
then tell me. I want to hear you say it.
I love you.
Hey. It's Peter. I'm sorry. I know it's early. Did I wake you?
uh, no, that's okay. What's up?
me and Walter for the last 24 hours. We've been working on the machine.
did you make any progress? - Yes. I think we had a breakthrough.
could be the first step towards getting me back home, but...
but... - There's something I need your help with.
harvard UNIVERSITY
gently, gently...
the trick is to ensure optimal heat distribution...
while not allowing the mixture to separate.
Ah, Olivia, you're just in time. - What is that smell?
Walter is creating a new breakfast cocktail... hot cinnamon roll.
did you know that the cocktail was historically conceived as a morning beverage?
the etymology of the word itself,"cocktail,
comes from the magnificent rooster, who announces the dawn of each day.
what's in it?
Oh, boy. It's mostly cinnamon schnapps and butter, but... Right now it's mostly butter.
it needs more butter.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired... that's all.
uh, what did you need my help with?
Peter and I have completed the biomechanical interface for the machine.
the device is uniquely calibrated to work only with Peter's genetic profile.
it uses an organic interface to transcode Peter's neural impulses into command directives.
just watch.
so you're able to control the machine with your thoughts through this?
that's how I was able to do it back in my timeline.
and what, you just click your heels and think of home?
well, we haven't quite worked out how that works yet, but that's kind of how I ended up here in oz in the first place, so in theory, yeah.
we won't know for sure until we're able to test the prototype on the machine itself.
which would require Broyles' authorization. Now I know why I'm here.
you don't mind asking him, do you? - No, of course not. I'll see what I can do.
welcome to Vermont. - Thanks. So what brings us here?
atlantic 591 was passing overhead when a disturbance occurred mid-flight.
it appears their electrical and hydraulic systems failed.
Walter? I'm sorry. I can't seem to reach him.
any survivors? - None.
NTSB is currently working the crash site about two miles south of here.
Walter... - But we think whatever caused the crash originated in this location.
on what basis?
approximately three hours ago, every vehicle on this stretch of highway inexplicably lost power.
well, it could be some sort of interference. Are there any high-frequency radio towers around?
none. That wouldn't explain some of the stranger events described by witnesses. Objects suspended in midair...
Walter, are you getting this? Can you hear me? Walter...
for God's sake, woman, lower your decibels. - You're here, in person.
I thought it was a nice day for a drive.
well, let's get started, shall we?
well done convincing him to leave the lab.
don't look at me. This was his idea.
I guess he finally got tired of being caged up.
Yeah, it's not just that. I mean, he's been much more open lately, somehow.
Peter! Look at this.
Walter, what are you doing? This car belongs to someone.
just watch.
huh. It's magnetized.
as I suspected... I didn't think that those levitating effects that the witnesses described were the result of a change in gravity.
on the contrary, it seems that for a brief moment, the electromagnetic force in this area was increased dramatically.
which is why all of the cars' electrical systems failed... And probably the plane's as well.
and it was strong enough...
to leave a residual magnetic force in all metal objects in the vicinity.
do you have any idea what caused it?
no. Not yet. I'll... I'll need to take some samples before I can develop a proper theory.
um, but I-I-I will require some of the plane's wreckage and the black box.
go ahead and collect whatever evidence you need here.
agent Farnsworth and I will coordinate with NTSB to take custody of the wreckage and the bodies.
while I'm collecting the samples, just down the road, I saw a sign for a place that serves delicious homemade rhubarb pie.
who's hungry?
welcome home to WESTFIELD We've missed you! POP: 584
homemade rhubarb pie
there.
the best in Westfield." Do you see?
damn it. - What's up?
I can't get a signal.
I'm gonna hit that pay phone on the corner, see if I can get an E. T.A. from Astrid.
we may have to get the rhubarb to go.
all right. We'll meet you in there. - Okay.
come on in out of the cold, gentlemen. Have a seat.
what can I get for you?
your largest slice of rhubarb pie and coffee, please.
all right. And for you? - Just the bathroom.
uh, it's in the back there... first door on your right.
Thanks.
so where you folks from? - Boston.
Ah, it's a lovely city. Got an uncle out in Somerville.
your first time in Vermont?
are we in Vermont? I had no idea.
what, you folks lost? - Not that I'm aware of.
well, how does a man drive all the way from Boston to Vermont and not even know that he's there?
Oh, I'm not allowed to drive.
I haven't renewed my license since I got out of the mental institution.
you know what? I like you. Pie's on the house.
Oh. Thank you.
Hey. Looks like June got you some coffee.
how's your evening going?
excellent. And yours?
just fine. So what can I get for you? - Pardon?
what do you want to order?
but... But I ordered a moment ago.
this is my busiest shift. Do you want to order or not?
but I did. I-I ordered rhubarb pie.
and you even offered to give it to me free of charge.
are you trying to steal food? - No, of course not.
nobody steals from me. Not you, not Cliff, nobody. You hear me, old man?
I hear you. I hear you perfectly well.
Oh. Still got to get you that pie.
must've forgot. I'm sorry about that.
please...
and there you go. Anything else I can get for you?
no. Thank you very much.
you're very welcome.
I'm okay.
what... what happened?
I don't know, but there's a guy in the back room.
I think the cook attacked him. He's pretty beat up.
thank you.
come on. - Pulse pressure's weak...
probably as a result of the puncture in the arm.
an inch to the right, it would've hit his brachial artery.
I just found another body behind the counter.
what are you thinking, serial killer? - I don't know.
I mean, I think there's something off about this entire town. - Meaning what?
the whole place is deserted. I can't get a cell signal. All the phone lines are down.
do I take that to mean that we can't call for an ambulance?
what, you can't treat him here? - Well, he's lost too much blood.
unless he is administered fluid, resuscitation, and a blood transfusion immediately, he may not make it.
well, the nearest hospital is 20 miles away.
then let's get movin'. Grab his feet.
now Leaving WESTFIELD Thank you for visiting!
where am I? - You've sustained some injuries.
we're going to get you to a hospital. - No.
no, we can't leave. We... we can't leave.
you're going to be all right. Stay with us. What's your name?
welcome home to WESTFIELD We've missed you! POP: 584
did you see that? - Yeah,"Welcome to Westfield.
y-you must've gotten turned around someplace. - Yeah, I guess so.
you just got to stay on the main road. It takes you right back to the highway.
Yeah, I-I thought I did.
now Leaving WESTFIELD Thank you for visiting!
welcome home to WESTFIELD We've missed you! POP: 584
what the hell is going on here? - That's not possible.
we can't leave. We can't leave.
we can't leave.
I think our friend's right.
we're trapped here.
Westfield SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
Hello? FBI. Anyone here?
put him down here, Peter.
his pulse is dropping. Start the blood transfusion immediately.
with what, Walter?
uh, see if you can find a first aid Kit. There might be an I. V.
I'm "O" negative, so I can donate.
okay, the phones are out here too. Walter, why can't we leave?
do you think it's got something to do with what happened on the highway?
I'm not sure. I've seen this once before.
where?
Brigadoon. The musical.
magical town in the forest where no one can leave.
of course, that quaint Scottish village was more hospitable than our present locale.
come on, Walter.
I haven't formed a hypothesis at the moment. My concern is keeping this man alive.
found an I. V. kit. - Good. Put pressure here.
prepare two needles.
we're not safe here.
this town... Everyone's crazy.
it started three nights ago.
my sister woke us up. She was frantic.
she was so scared.
a man had broken into her house.
I tried calling the sheriff, but the phones were down, so I went over.
when I got there, I found...
her husband in the bedroom...
shot in the head...
point-blank.
the intruder killed him?
not the intruder.
her.
she said she'd never seen him before in her life.
they'd been married for 18 years.
so the effects are amnesic?
not exactly. She was delusional, she was talking about people she'd never met...
things she'd never done...
children she didn't have.
it was as if she was...
having memories, all of a sudden, from someone else's life.
the symptoms you're describing... it resembles schizophrenia.
I know it well.
except it wasn't just her.
it was everyone.
so how can an entire town turn schizophrenic overnight?
some sort of biological contagion? Maybe a virus that affects the human brain?
a virus doesn't explain why we drive out one side of town and right in the other.
Oh, this is something else.
what else can you tell us about the symptoms?
most got sick right away. Others took longer, like, hours, a day.
but it always started the same way.
first, confusion, forgetting things... Tremors.
some of them became paranoid.
others turned violent.
like our friend at the diner.
a few of us who are immune are holed up at the high school. Including my wife and daughter.
that's why I went to the diner, to get them food.
they need supplies.
but what they need most of all is hope.
knowing that the FBI is here might give them that.
all right, we need to find a way to contact Broyles and let him know what's going on here.
I did find some radios out back. I could try to send out a signal, but I'm gonna need an elevated place with a clear line of sight and something to boost the power.
there is a... an emergency generator at the high school.
what do you think?
I think we're gonna need a few things first.
you know, I think there's a military base about 50 miles from here.
you think the army's involved in this?
I mean, something of this magnitude... a whole town?
perhaps it was a military experiment gone wrong, like that case we caught in Edina.
Where's Edina? - Uh, upstate New York.
remember, the whole town's population was disfigured from the military experiment?
we never had such a case.
I investigated a case in Edina with my Walter and my Olivia.
Oh, right.
right, well, I must've... I must've read it in your debrief.
Oh, uh, Peter, now, now, I don't consider myself to be a violent man...
per se, but given the danger of our, uh, present predicament,
I think it would be best if I had one of those.
pepper spray? - Just remember it shoots that way.
you ever use a gun?
I'm a teacher. - Okay, red button, safety.
come on.
okay, let's go.
what's that? - W... shh, shh.
you guys hear that?
we got to get out of this town.
come on.
it won't start.
the increase in electromagnetism that caused the cars to lose power on the highway must be present in this town too.
we can wait, but we have no idea how long it will last.
I see the resemblance. - Pardon?
agent Dunham said his name is Bishop, like yours. He's your son, isn't he?
in a fashion, yes, you could say that.
you all right? - Yeah.
it's just... my arm won't stop shaking. That's all.
whoa, whoa. What's the matter?
no, I'm okay. It's just... I'm just a little bit dizzy.
you need some water?
Oh, Peter, I don't know how to explain it, but that feels like there was somebody else in my, uh... in my head.
here... Take this.
I-I-I'm scared that... that what's happening to the other people in this town is happening to me.
open up. It's Cliff.
cliff. Who are they?
they're FBI, Brian. I'll explain inside.
I thought you were dead. What happened?
long story.
how many people do you have here?
12 of us made it.
eleven. Teresa.
when? - This morning.
locked her up in one of the empty classrooms. Couldn't take the chance she'd hurt one of us.
daddy! - Lacey-girl.
Oh, my God. I thought you were... - No, no. I'm here. I'm here.
we got to tell Walter.
if you think what's happening to these people is happening to you...
so, FBI, huh? Where's the rest of you?
uh, they'll be here soon.
we've been trapped here for days. Our whole damn town's destroyed.
our friends, our families... everyone's going crazy, and the U. S. government sends three people?
look, I understand that you have questions, but all I can tell you at the moment is that help will come.
now, in the meantime, we need to work together, find out what's going on here, and also how to get out.
if I could examine one of the victims, we might get answers to what's happening in this town.
I heard that one of your party went insane. May I see her?
you're the man from the government.
you're here about our air quality.
the air quality's bad here, isn't it?
may I?
fascinating. - What is it, Walter?
I'll need to take a blood sample.
the cook at the diner had two irises in each eye.
perhaps whatever is afflicting these people is creating some sort of rapid mitosis, causing the cells to replicate exponentially, duplicating body parts.
I'm going to ask you some questions, Teresa.
I should start supper.
lee's going to be home soon.
H-her husband... he passed six, seven years ago.
so when was the last time you saw Lee, Teresa?
this morning. I packed his lunch before he went to work.
and what did you and Lee talk about this morning?
is this a joke? Some sick joke? - Sorry?
my Lee's dead...
seven years this April.
I should start supper. Lee's gonna be home soon.
how did it go? Did you get the radio to work?
I couldn't get a signal.
even if I had a generator twice that size, there's just too much electromagnetic interference.
I think we're stuck here for a while.
what's wrong?
that woman, Teresa... her husband died seven years ago, and yet she thinks she talked to him this morning.
let Walter test your blood too.
it's the only way you're gonna know for sure.
they're probably just psychosomatic... these things you're feeling.
you were always very empathetic, even as a child.
that's why you're such a great investigator...
you ability to empathize with the victims. That's all this is.
a-and if it's something worse, then we'll deal with it.
well, I-I need to go and examine this.
well, I'm glad you're here... not just for me but for him.
I've seen the way he's been with you lately.
before you got here, he was kind of shut down and isolated.
he's a lot like my Walter, this one.
what's she like? - Pardon me?
the other Olivia. I'm just curious.
I don't know, she's, uh...
she's driven. She's very, very stubborn.
she doesn't like to lose.
but she sees the best in people, even when they don't see it themselves.
when she first found me, I was in Baghdad trying to run a scam on these two iranian businessmen.
I didn't picture you as the scamming type.
that's what made me so good at it.
anyway, it was all supposed to be temporary.
she told me I just had to babysit Walter while he was working on a case for the FBI, and then after it was done, I could leave, go back to my own life...
despite, of course, how gorgeous she is.
well, you've got good taste.
she gave me something that I hadn't had since...
really since my mom died. She gave me...
a place to call home...
a place I'd want to call home.
eventually, we even had our own thing.
a thing?
Yeah, a thing. A routine, you know?
on friday nights, we'd get together. We'd watch cheesy horror films and order in from Damiano's. You ever been?
no, but I've driven past on my way home.
it's good. You should check it out.
well, she's lucky to have you.
Oh, my God! No!
what happened? - I don't know. I just found her like this.
she got loose somehow.
I don't understand. She was fine when we got here.
I mean, if it happened to her, what's to say it's not gonna happen to rest of us, and why hasn't anybody come?
we're all gonna be okay.
we just need to figure out what's happening here and find out how to get out.
they shouldn't even be here.
I'm sorry?
last fall I was offered a teaching job in Philadelphia.
angela wanted me to take it. I convinced her to stay.
I think deep down I was scared to leave here.
this town is all I've ever known.
if I had just taken that job, my family would be safe now.
maybe. But you are here, and if it weren't for you, they might not have made it this far.
will Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop please report to the biology lab at once?
Olivia and Peter to the biology lab. Thank you.
I think I've worked out what's happened in this town.
when I examined Teresa's blood, I found 92 chromosomes in her DNA.
well, that's twice the genetic material that should appear in any human being.
okay, well, how is that possible?
besides... What it did to the goldfish, the effect on the physics in the overlapping areas was catastrophic.
gravity, electromagnetic fields...
Walter, what you're saying is the two universes merged together somehow?
Yeah, I'm afraid I am.
these two circles...
represent the respective universes.
and this overlap is the town.
now, for reasons that I am yet to deduce, our westfield has merged with the westfield from the alternate universe, trapping the three of us in the overlap.
okay, well, how can two universes merging drive an entire town insane?
maybe the same thing that's happening to the town is happening to the towns people.
they're merging with their doppelgangers.
which would explain why Teresa, uh, thought her husband was alive and dead at the same time.
I mean, can you imagine being flooded with years of experiences and memories that were not your own?
the mind... unable to distinguish between what's real and what is not.
okay, well, can it be reversed?
sadly, no. I am afraid the damage is done.
so what are you saying, Walter, that Olivia's... - What?
no, Olivia's blood was fine.
did I fail to mention that? - Yes, you left that part out.
Oh, you're... you're perfectly fine, dear.
but Cliff said that he turned down a job offer in Philadelphia last fall.
right, but in the alternate universe, he must've taken the job and moved his family.
Hey, Walter, could any of this happen naturally?
I-I-I-I don't see how.
when belly and I merged just a tiny portion of the universes, the energy required was tremendous.
I-I can't imagine an energy source that would merge an entire town.
what about Amphilocite?
Yes, that would do it.
you think that David Robert Jones is involved?
I don't know, but maybe that's why he was at the quarry.
mining Amphilocite, to do this.
but why? I mean, to what end?
of course, if my theory's correct, it presents a more pressing problem.
the effects I have just described... t-they are just phase one.
what's phase two?
agent Dunham, you need to see this.
that... Is phase two.
Lacey, come on. Come away from there, honey.
daddy, what's happening?
it's gonna be okay. Go with mommy.
I just don't know what to do.
the two towns have merged together.
they're creating an excess of mass and energy in the overlapping regions.
the fundamental forces of physics are colliding...
out of balance, destroying everything.
well, isn't there anywhere we'll be safe?
no.
two things cannot occupy the same space without dire consequences.
both towns will be destroyed and all of us with them.
there's nothing we can do.
there's nothing we can do.
m-maybe you should go and talk to him.
me?
well, I've seen how you two are together, and he seems to respond to you.
there must be something we can do.
you said that the forces of nature are colliding.
do you think they could be offset by opposite forces?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
the sum of equal and opposite vectors is... is zero.
very clever, Peter.
we need to find the place where the opposite forces meet and cancel out.
like the eye of the storm.
in a hurricane, the center is said to be the safest spot.
and after this thing is said and done, it might be the only place that survives.
of course. We need to find the true center of the merger.
okay, well, you do that. I'm gonna get us a ride.
come on.
okay, we need to get to a place where we're gonna be safe from the destruction.
where? - We're working on it.
but we're gonna need vehicles to transport us there.
now, we know that the phenomenon affects electronics, so any fuel-injected engines won't work.
we need older cars, uh, any running models from the 1970s...
two, maybe three to transport everyone safely.
I might have a better idea.
we left town here.
and we entered for the first time here.
and Cliff said the first building to fall was the bank here on river and highway.
right. So, in order to find the bull's-eye...
connect the points. - Divide in half.
construct the perpendicular bisectors. - And extend to their intersection...
in the center here.
we think the center's gonna be right there.
cypress and Quimby." That looks about four miles from here.
if Peter's theory is correct, it will be the only thing left standing when the town collapses upon itself.
need a ride?
daddy won't let anything happen to you. Go ahead.
mommy.
where am I going? - Okay, uh, Cypress and Quimby. Do you know that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a bike shop there.
don't cry, dear. We're going to a safe place.
we'll be fine. You'll see.
nice shot.
okay, is everyone all right?
I think we better get moving.
okay.
well, that's not moving!
okay, everyone, we're on foot from here! Make sure you stay together.
come on, run!
go, go, go!
that the last of them? - Yes.
come on!
hurry up! Let's go!
Lacey! - Daddy!
let's go, let's go!
everybody inside!
Walter, what are you doing? Come on, get inside.
Peter. Peter, you were right.
this is it. This is the eye of the storm.
great.
we'll be fine. We... we'll be safe here.
daddy, I'm scared.
so loud.
understood. Coordinate with C. O.C. and keep me apprised of any changes.
anything? - Search teams just checked in.
they scanned the entire area. No other survivors.
and it gets worse. - How?
during the search, we found several unusual devices.
we're not sure how the technology works, but they were placed around the perimeter of the town.
david Robert Jones. - Hazmat detected trace amounts of Amphilocite.
what would David Robert Jones have to gain by destroying a town that people didn't even know was here to begin with?
I don't know.
but the amount of Amphilocite recovered from those devices is only a fraction of Jones' stockpile.
sir, we've got director Norris.
go home. I can take it from here.
Hey.
how is Lacey holding up?
it's just a sprain. She's fine. She's strong.
and how are you?
my home...
everything I've ever known... how did they just disappear?
I wish I knew.
even if you did, you probably wouldn't be able to tell me, right?
the bureau is gonna help you with temporary housing until you get back on your feet.
well, we have each other. No matter what happens, we'll face it together.
beautiful.
see you tomorrow.
you're leaving? But I-I've made crepes... breakfast for dinner.
second most important meal of the day.
Oh, yes. We can resume our efforts to get you home.
good night.
good night, Walter.
Hey, come in.
no, why would I? I'm gonna pour you a drink.
what is that that smells so fantastic?
what do you mean? It's friday. I ordered Damiano's.
well, there he goes sitting in the lap of luxury, the world at his feet.
Oh, well, I can always say I knew him when I'll just go out of his life quletly.
I would like to wish him luck, though.
sure. Why not?
it's me -- your old friend Jiminy, remember?
Jiminy! Gee, I'm glad to see ya!
what's happened?!
what did he do to you?
Oh, he was mad!
he said he was gonna push my face in everybody's eye!
and just because I'm a goldbrick, he's gonna chop me into firewood!
Oh, is that so?
now, don't you worry, son.
I'll have you out of here in no time at all.
why, this is just as easy as rolling off a...
kinda rusty.
needs a little oil.
well, that's what I said.
must be one of the old models.
you mean you can't open it?
Yeah.
looks pretty hopeless.
it'll take a miracle to get us out of here.
Gee...
a fine conscience I turned out to be.
I should've listened to you, Jiminy.
no. It was my fault.
I shouldn't have walked out on you.
guess I'll never see my father again.
Oh, buck up, son.
it could be worse.
be cheerful...
like me!
take it easy, son.
come on -- blow.
Attaboy.
Oh, well...
it stopped raining, anyway.
Hey, that star again!
the lady!
the fairy!
what'll she say?
what'll I tell her?
well, you might tell her the truth.
why, Pinocchio...
hello.
sir Jiminy...
well, this is a pleasant surprise.
Pinocchio, why didn't you go to school?
school?
go ahead. Tell her.
I was going to school till I met somebody.
met somebody?
Yeah. Two big monsters...
with big, green eyes.
why...
monsters? Weren't you afraid?
no, ma'am, but they tied me in a big sack.
you don't say!
and where was Sir Jiminy?
Oh. Jiminy?
leave me out of this.
they put him in a little sack.
No!
Yeah!
how did you escape? -- I didn't.
they chopped me into firewood!
Oh! Oh, look! My nose!
what's happened?
perhaps you haven't been telling the truth, Pinocchio.
perhaps? -- Oh, but I have.
every single word!
Oh, please, help me. I'm awful sorry.
you see, Pinocchio, a lie keeps growing and growing until it's as plain as the nose on your face.
she's right, Pinoke. You better come clean.
I'll never Iie again -- honest, I won't.
please, Your Honour...
... I mean, Miss Fairy.
give him another chance...
for my sake, will ya? Huh?
I'll forgive you this once, but remember
a boy who won't be good might just as well be made of wood.
we'll be good, won't we?
very well. But this is the last time I can help you.
gee, look, Jiminy, my nose!
Hey, we're free! Come on, Pinoke.
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane
I eat the best and I drink champagne
I got no strings on me
Toodle-oo, Stromboli.
goodbye, Mr. Stromb
Qulet!
let's get out of here before something else happens.
an actor's life for me
a high silk hat and a silver cane
a watch of gold with a diamond chain
an actor's life is gay
it's great to be a celebrity
an actor's life for me
and the dummy fell for it.
hook, line, and sinker!
and he still thinks we're his friends.
and did Stromboli pay?
plenty.
that shows you how low Honest John will stoop...
eh, Giddy?
now, coachman...
what's your proposition?
well...
how would you blokes like to make some real money?
well! And who do we have to...
no, no. Nothing like that.
you see...
I'm collecting stupid little boys.
stupid little boys?
you know, the disobedient ones who want to play hooky from school.
and you see...
Yes.
and I take them to Pleasure Island.
pleasure Island.
pleasure Island?!
but the law! Suppose they
no, no. There's no risk.
they never come back as boys!
now... I've got a coach load leaving at midnight.
we'll meet at the crossroads
and no double-crossing!
no, sir. -- Scout around...
and any good prospects you find, bring them to me.
Yes, chief. -- I'll pay you well.
I got plenty of gold.
Yes, yes.
no, sir! Nothing can stop me now!
I'll make good this time.
you'd better!
I will. I'm going to school!
that's the stuff, Pinoke!
I'd rather be smart than be an actor.
now you're talking!
come on, slow-poke. I'll race you home!
well, well. Pinocchio.
what's your rush?
I gotta beat Jiminy home.
Oh, hello.
well, how is the great actor?
I don't want to be an actor.
Stromboli was terrible.
he was? -- Yeah.
he locked me in a birdcage.
he did? -- Uh-huh.
and I learnt my Iesson.
I'm going -- -- Oh, you poor, poor boy.
you must be a nervous wreck.
that's it! You are a nervous wreck!
we must diagnose this case at once.
quick, Doctor, your notebook.
bless my soul.
my, my.
just as I thought.
a slight touch of monetary complications with bucolic semilunar contraptions of the flying trapezes.
say, "Hippopotamus.
I knew it!
compound transmission of the pandemonium with percussion and spasmodic frantic disintegration.
close your eyes. What do you see?
nothing.
open them. Now what do you see?
spots.
now, that heart.
Ooh, my goodness!
a palpating syncopation of the killer diller with a wicky-wacky stamping of the boy-joy.
quick, Doctor, that report!
this makes it perfectly clear!
my boy, you are allergic.
allergic?
Yes, and there is only one cure.
a vacation on Pleasure Island!
pleasure Island?
Yes! That happy Iand of carefree boys where every day's a holiday!
but I can't go. I
why, of course you can go!
I'm giving you my ticket.
here.
Thanks! But I'm
I insist!
your health comes first.
come! The coach departs at midnight!
it's Pleasure Isle for me
where every day is a holiday
and kids have nothing to do but play
now, where do you suppose he -- huh?
Pinocchio! Hey, come back!
well...
...Here we go again.
my name's Lampwick.
what's yours?
you ever been to Pleasure Island?
Unh-unh, but Mr. Honest John gave me
me neither, but they say it's a swell joint
no school, no cops.
you can tear the joint apart and nobody says a word.
honest John gave me
loaf around, plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and it's all free.
boy, that's the place. I can hardly wait.
right here, boys! Right here!
get your cake, pie, dill pickles, and ice cream!
eat all you can! Be a glutton!
stuff yourselves! It's all free, boys!
it's all free! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
the rough house! The rough house!
it's the roughest, toughest joint you ever seen!
come in and pick a fight, boys!
Oh, boy, a scrap!
come on, let's go in and poke somebody in the nose.
Why?
Aw, just for the fun of it.
okay, Lampy.
tobacco row! Tobacco row!
get your cigars, cigarettes, and chewing tobacco!
come in and smoke your heads off!
there's nobody here to stop you!
there's something...phoney about all this.
I've gotta get him outta here.
hurry, hurry, hurry!
see the model home. It's open for destruction.
and it's all yours, boys! It's all yours!
What'd I tell ya? Ain't this a swell joint?
Yeah! Being bad's a lot of fun, ain't it?
Yeah.
get a load of that stained-glass window.
alright, now, hop to it, you blokes.
come on! Come on!
shut the doors and Iock them tight!
now get below and get them crates ready.
give a bad boy enough rope, and he'll soon make a jackass of himself.
where is everybody?
place is like a graveyard.
I don't like the looks of this.
Hey, where are you?!
where do you suppose all the kids went to, Lampwick?
they're around here somewheres. What do you care?
you're having a good time, ain't ya?
Uh-huh. I sure am.
Oh, boy. This is the life, huh, Pinokey?
Yeah.
it sure is.
Ah, you smoke like my grandmother.
come on, take a big drag!
like this.
okay, Lampy.
some fun, huh, kid?
okay, Slats, your shot.
what's the matter, Slats? Losing your grip?
so this is where I find you!
how do you ever expect to be a real boy?!
look at yourself -- smoking!
playing pool!
you're coming right home with me this minute!
Hey...who's the beetle?
put me down!
he's my conscience.
he tells me what's right and wrong.
What?!
you mean to tell me you take orders from a grasshopper?!
grasshopper?!
look here, you -- you ignorant young pup!
it wouldn't hurt you to take orders from your grasshop
er, er, your conscience... if you have one.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.
screwball in the corner pocket.
why -- why, you young hoodlum,
I'll -- I'll knock your block off!
why, I'll take you apart and put you back together!
Oh, don't hurt him, Jiminy. He's my best friend.
why, I'll -- your best friend?!
and what am I? Just your conscience.
okay, that settles it.
but, Jiminy
you buttered your bread. Now sleep in it!
go on, laugh! Make a jackass outta yourself!
I am through! This is the end.
but, Jiminy...
lampwick says a guy only Iives once.
come on! Come on! Let him go!
burns me up.
after all I tried to do for him.
who's his conscience anyway
me or that hoodlum Lampwick?
I've had enough of this.
I'm taking the next boat outta here.
open up that door. Open up!
I want to go home!
come on, you blokes! Keep her moving!
lively there now. We haven't got all night!
Where'd all the donkeys come from?
come on! Come on! Let's have another!
and what's your name?
okay, you'll do.
in you go!
you boys will bring a nice price!
all right, next!
and what might your name be?
so you can talk.
Yes, sir.
I want to go home to my mama!
take him back!
he can still talk!
please, please, I don't want to be a donkey!
let me outta here!
Qulet!
you boys have had your fun, now pay for it!
boys?
so that's why
hear that beetle talk...
you'd think something was gonna happen to us.
conscience. Ah, phooey!
where does he get that stuff?
how do ya ever expect to be a real boy?
what's he think I look like a jackass?
you sure do!
Hey, you laugh like a donkey!
did that come outta me?
what the
what's going on?!
I've been double-crossed!
help! Help!
somebody help!
I've been framed!
help!
please, you've gotta help me!
be a pal!
call that beetle! Call anybody!
mama!
mama!
Oh! What's happened?!
I hope I'm not too late!
what'll I do?!
Jiminy! Oh, Jiminy, help!
quick! Pinoke! The kids! The boys!
they're all donkeys!
you too!
come on, quick! Before you get any worse!
this way, Pinoke! It's the only way out!
hurry up... before they see us!
you gotta jump!
you alright?
sure.
I thought we'd never make it.
certainly feels good to be back on dry land.
come on. Let's get home.
father! Father, I'm home!
we're home, Mr. Geppetto! -- It's me -- Pinocchio!
I'm home to stay!
here he is, Mr. Geppetto! Home at Iast!
Hey, maybe he's asleep.
father! Father, it's me!
Pinoke, come here.
look.
he ain't here.
he's gone.
Yeah, and Figaro.
and Cleo, too.
maybe something awful happened to him.
don't worry, son. He probably hasn't gone far.
it's a message.
what's it say?
it's about your father.
where is he?
why, it says here he
he went looking for you, and he was swallowed by a whale.
swallowed by a whale?!
Yeah. A whale?!
a whale named Monstro!
Oh, he's
but wait. He's alive.
aIive? Where?
inside the whale at the bottom of the sea.
bottom of the sea?!
where you going?!
I'm going to find him!
but, Pinoke, are you crazy?!
don't you realise he's in a whale?
I gotta go to him.
Hey, Pinoke! Wait!
listen here, son!
but this Monstro -- I've heard of him.
he's a whale of a whale!
why, he swallows whole ships alive!
tie it good and tight, now.
and besides, it's dangerous. Why, I
Bye, Jiminy.
goodbye?
I may be Iive bait down there, but I'm with ya. Come on.
let's go.
look out below!
gangway down there!
Gee...what a big place!
come on, Jiminy!
alright. Soon as I take on some ballast.
one side, sister.
well, so long.
put it in the wrong end.
no more privacy than a goldfish.
Ooh, chilly!
father!
father!
Hey, Pinoke, wait for me!
father!
father!
he ain't my father.
Mr. Geppetto!
Hey, what the
let go!
run along you little... squirt.
what's the matter, kid? I was only
we were only looking for Monstro.
that got them.
father!
father!
Oh. Hello.
can you tell me where we can find Monstro?
will ya?
gee. They're scared.
pardon me, Pearl.
are you acquainted with Monstro, the whale?
whoa, hold it, there.
father!
one side there, son.
come on, boys, break it up.
break it up, now.
Hey, what the
quit shoving, now.
don't
take it easy. Take it easy, there.
steady there, Nellie.
go ahead, Pinoke. Ask them.
could any of you tell me where to find Monstro?
thanks a lot.
father!
father!
Mr. Geppetto!
not a bite for days.
we can't hold out much longer.
I never thought it would end this way, Figaro
starving to death in the belly of a whale.
my poor little Pinocchio.
he was such a good boy.
it's hopeless, Figaro.
there isn't a fish Ieft.
if the monster doesn't wake up soon, I
I'm afraid we are done for.
here they come!
tuna! Tuna fish!
food! We'll eat!
here's a big one.
get them in there, Figaro!
wait!
wait a minute! Have you seen
Oh, we gotta get out of here!
come on, Pinoke, don't wait for me!
never saw so many!
here's another one!
enough for weeks!
here's a big one.
keep them in there, Figaro!
Hey, blubber mouth, open up!
I gotta get in there!
I gotta get in there!
it looks like the last of them.
here's a big one! Only a few Ieft!
we gotta work fast!
Hey!
here's another one!
Hey, Father!
father!
don't bother me now, Pinocchio!
father!
Pinocchio! My son!
Hey, Father! Here I am!
huh? Oh, oh, yes!
Pinocchio! My boy.
I'm so happy to see you!
me, too, Father.
you're here, too.
Yes.
we all are together again.
Oh, you are soaking wet.
Yes, Father.
you mustn't catch cold.
but I came to see you!
you shouldn't have come down here.
but, Father
but I'm awfully glad to see you.
let me take your hat.
what's the matter?
those ears!
huh? Ears?
Oh, these.
Oh, that's nothing.
I got a tail, too!
what's happened to you?
well, I -- I -- I
Oh, never mind now.
old Geppetto has his little wooden head.
nothing else matters.
I gotta get in. My pal's in there!
come on, ya big moose, open up, I tell ya!
Hey! Cut it out!
Hey! Go on! Beat it, ya buzzards!
get out? Oh, no, no, son.
I've tried every way.
why, I even built a raft!
a raft?
that's it.
we'll take the raft, and when the whale opens his mouth
no, no, no, no. Now listen, son.
he only opens his mouth when he's eating.
then everything comes in.
nothing goes out.
it's hopeless, Pinocchio.
come, we'll make a nice fire, and we'll cook some of the fish.
a fire! That's it!
Yes, and then we'll all eat again.
a great big fire!
lots of smoke!
smoke? Oh, yeah, sure.
a smoked fish will taste good.
quick -- some wood!
Pinocchio, not the chair!
hurry, Father! More wood!
Oh, what will we sit on if we
we won't need it! We're getting out!
getting out? But how?
we'll make him sneeze!
make him sneeze?
Ohh, that will make him mad!
well, it's about time!
it won't work!
hurry, Father! CIimb aboard!
we'll never get by those teeth!
Yes, we will!
Hey, which way you going?! Wait for me!
hang on! Here we go!
Gesundheit.
we are going back!
no, we'll make it! Faster! Faster!
it's no use! Here it goes!
we made it!
look, now he is mad!
I told you he'd be furious!
he's gone!
Where'd he go?!
look out!
hang on!
he's coming back! Hurry!
he's trying to get us! Paddle, son!
let's go back!
look out! Jump!
father! Father!
Oh, Father!
Pinocchio, swim for shore. Swim for shore.
hang on, Father!
Save...yourself.
Pinocchio...save yourself.
don't mind me, son.
save yourself...Pinocchio.
my boy...
my brave little boy...
prove yourself brave, truthful, and unselfish, and someday you will be a real boy.
awake, Pinocchio.
awake.
father!
what cha crying for?
Cause...you're dead, Pinocchio.
No! No, I'm not!
Yes, yes, you are.
now Iie down
but, Father, I'm alive. See?
and...
and I'm...
I'm...
I'm real!
I'm a real boy!
you're alive!
and you are a real boy!
a real, Iive boy!
this calls for a celebration!
professor! Lots of music!
well! This is practically where I came in.
thank you, milady.
he deserved to be a real boy.
and it sure was nice of you to
well, I'll be!
my, my!
solid gold, too.
Oh, I think it's swell!
when your heart is in your dreams
no request is too extreme
when you wish upon a star
your dreams
come true
you'll find your dreams come true
Worcester, MASS,
you're gonna be late!
Oh, look at yourself.
tuck in your shirt.
put a comb through your hair, for god's sake.
Dara's son, he always takes care of his appearance.
it's Mee-gar.
late again and you're making personal calls?
Oh, no, I'm-- who's this?
nobody.
she your girlfriend?
no, she came with the phone.
what are you stalking this girl?
no.
are you kidding me?
Aw, come on.
unbelievable.
two in one week.
your sweep's leaving, meager.
get on it...
or get another gig.
Hi, how are you today?
and we're still on for the regional manager's meeting tomorrow at 4: 00?
great.
Yeah, thank you.
okay, great.
no problem.
okay, thank you.
Bye-bye.
Oh, I'm so-- I did not mean to interrupt.
no problem.
don't you usually have the little tablet thingy with you?
Yeah.
uh, I usually do.
is there something else, or...
I used to be a webelo.
And?
um, the webelos...
cub scouts?
your brownie patch.
Oh!
Oh, yeah.
no, I-- I actually found that online.
it's kitschy, right?
I was gonna put it on one of my jackets.
Oh, that's-- oh, that's, uh-- yeah, that's cool.
Hey, Bethany, we still on for drinks tonight?
of course.
you better not keep me out too late this time.
we'll see.
no, no, no, no.
no, no, please.
don't do this to me!
no.
what happened?
damn it!
Oh, my god!
do not crash on me.
this is not happening.
hold it!
hold it!
please hold the elevator.
I've got to find an I.T.guy.
this is a disaster.
Oh, you dropped your ph
are you okay?
get away from me!
Oh, no.
stop it!
stop it!
Boston MASS
I'm telling you because you knew about John and you didn't say anything,
so I trust you.
at least enough for me to not think you're gonna think I'm crazy.
Oh, of course not.
I saw him last night.
you saw John.
Yes, in my kitchen.
Hello, Liv.
I grabbed my gun, but he was gone.
I know he wasn't there.
obviously.
I--I just-- let me see.
you fall in love with your partner...who betrays you...and your country.
he dies in your arms.
then he shows up in your kitchen
and you're wondering if that's grounds to recuse yourself.
Yeah, okay, well, we can start with that.
I say no.
you're the one that exposed him.
bare minimum, that makes you indispensable.
you want my advice?
next time John shows up for a nightcap...
give him one.
I'm being serious.
so am I.
you think a few weeks pass
and everything you went through just goes away?
don't fight it.
don't beat yourself up.
you're good at that.
that's a character flaw.
it'll get easier.
harvard UNIVERSITY
did she say what it was about?
no.
she'll tell us when she gets here.
how are you feeling?
never been better.
Oh?
you look quite the opposite.
maybe that's 'cause I had a little trouble sleeping last night.
Oh, I had trouble sleeping myself.
I was thinking about that man.
the one who tortured you.
something about him.
so familiar.
Peter, when I was in st. Claire's
we don't have to talk about this.
it's not important.
but it is important.
you cannot imagine what it's like for a man like me
to not have access to parts of his mind.
you're doing fine, Walter.
Dr. Bishop.
Ah, visiting hours.
everybody put on their best straight jacket.
at approximately 10: 17 this morning,
a massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise in Worcester, massachusetts.
as a result, an elevator on the 26th floor plummeted straight to the basement.
eight passengers died.
did the cable snap?
that's what's strange.
the elevator didn't fall.
it drove itself into the ground.
that's not possible.
nine months ago, a maglev train in tokyo plowed through a crowded station.
publicly, reported as human error.
in reality, caused by a power surge of unknown origin.
intelligence chatter speculated that it might be a demonstration of a new weapon technology.
it's possible that this morning's event was another demonstration.
to override the elevator's circuitry would require a discharge of immense power and precision.
I've made arrangements for you to be received at the building.
we need to know what happened, how it happened,
and who's behind it.
I'm Peter simmons, the building's engineer.
this is my team, Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop.
so you've been briefed on what's happened?
Mm-hmm.
damn elevator powered itself into the floor.
never seen anything like it.
shouldn't the brakes have come on automatically?
well, that's the thing they did.
I mean, the safety's clamped onto the rails all right,
but for some reason, the motor just kept going.
nearly melted the shoes, which is technically-- impossible?
Yeah, we're seeing a lot of that lately.
you know your elevators.
mit drop-out.
is there any security camera footage?
Nope.
all the cameras fritzed.
Hey, can you people move out of there?
FBI coming through.
so how could an elevator drive itself?
it's almost like another generator came online, jacked into the system,
and overloaded it with double or triple the voltage.
exit wound burns.
Subconjuctival hemorrhages.
this woman displays all of the symptoms of a classic-- thermoelectric trauma.
what are you two saying?
he's saying that all these people were electrocuted.
electrocuted.
may I?
that's lovely.
24 carat gold.
traces of nickel, possibly cobalt.
how are you doing that?
this entire space is charged with electromagnetic energy.
far beyond that which occurs in nature.
there's still residual magnetic energy from whatever electrocuted these people.
I need to examine the victims' belongings.
and one of the bodies as well.
are you saying you may know how this happened?
no, not yet.
but I can tell you every one of the passengers in this elevator was dead
by the time they hit the ground.
I've worked on a project where I've seen this before.
the government had asked me if it was possible to make a human being trackable by pigeons.
like homing pigeons?
what possible use could that serve?
well, I'm sure it had something to do with the commies.
it always did back then.
regardless, our theory was that human beings are merely highly complex electrical systems.
battery, please, Olivia.
the heart, the brain driven by electrical impulses.
and because everyone has a unique electromagnetic signature,
like a fingerprint, then we theorized that properly altered,
pigeons should be able to hone into that signature.
like the way they know how to fly south for the winter.
precisely.
but the human field was too weak,
so we tried to augment it and make it stRong enough for the birds to detect.
did it work?
Oh, yes.
but the side effects negated our plans.
there was one test subject, every time she hiccupped, the lights would dim.
so you're saying these people could control electRonic devices?
no, not deliberately.
but I did surmise that it should be possible.
Oh.
did you just make that thing come back to life?
no, not in this particular instance.
but it does confirm my theory.
what theory?
didn't I say?
no.
well, someone has pursued this idea.
they have amplified a person's electromagnetic field.
and in fact, it is the residual energy from that person that is making this heart pump.
and further, it is that person who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator.
so you don't think it was a weapon that electrocuted those people?
no.
it was a human being.
accident occurred just after 10: 00 a. m.
here at the Herndon building in downtown Worcester.
Hey, Ron wanted to see you.
haven't yet been released,
dropped 26 stories to their death
when the building's elevator system failed catastrophically.
what's wrong with you?
investigators are now looking into possible answers as to why the emergency brakes...
you look sick.
thank you, Daniel.
excuse me, Mr. Boynton.
where have you been?
excuse me?
do you remember last week what I said to you?
the words I used?
how sympathetic i was?
what did I-- what did I say?
that--that you-- yeah, that you were watching my performance.
I said you had to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule.
because the system here,
even when things are working,
depends on people like you being,
at the very least, reliable.
I've--I've-- had a really hard day.
guess what?
your day is fantastic compared to mine.
no, it's not.
what the hell's on your uniform?
what?
what is that?
I don't--I don't know.
and I'm--I'm not sure.
I'll tell you what.
I'll make it easy.
it's not your uniform anymore.
get your ass down to the locker-- wait.
take it off and leave it there.
no, but--but please.
I take care of my mother.
Yeah, and I take care of my family.
and one of the ways I do that is to employ smart, reliable, capable people.
and you are none of those things.
please.
you're fired.
go.
Mr. Boyn-- get outta here, meager.
I don't want to see you in this building anymore.
get the hell outta here!
Aah!
here.
Thanks.
I thought you left hours ago.
I could say the same about you.
what are you reading?
neural distortion in human subjects.
and what's all this for?
I'm just trying to wrap my head around an idea Walter had.
he believes that it may be a person who was responsible for the Herndon incident.
not a person wielding some kind of device.
a person who has somehow developed the ability to affect,
or maybe even control, electrical devices.
and I suppose the good doctor has a theory how that's possible.
he thinks this person was altered in some way.
extensive procedures.
chemical therapy.
what?
in the course of investigating other pattern cases,
we've come across a handful of clinics.
off the grid operations that solicited clients by making the same kinds of claims
you see advertised on tv at 3: 00 a. m.
only they weren't actually providing weight loss or hair growth.
what were they really doing?
have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer?
no.
doctor of biotechnology.
wanted in four states and three countries for illegal human experimentation.
surgical alterations, radical hormone therapy.
using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs.
one subject was pumped full of stimulants and kept awake for a solid year.
fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images.
I only bring it up because if Dr. Bishop is right,
and there is a person with these extraordinary capabilities,
it might very well be that someone made him this way.
I'd like to read the files on dr. Fischer.
I'll have them transferred to your terminal.
but it's not easy stuff to look at.
Hello?
Hey, Liv.
it's okay.
it's okay.
it's just me.
I know this doesn't make any sense to you.
even if it did, I know you don't have any reason to trust me.
but that's what I'm asking you to do.
we don't have much time.
I'm here to help.
you tried to kill me.
no, Liv.
I loved you.
you know that.
you know i loved you.
I did.
always.
I can prove it to you.
but not here.
it's--it's just not the way it works.
you're on the right track.
I'm here to tell you that.
you're looking for a person, but Jacob Fischer is after him also.
you need to get to him first, before Fischer can use him.
use him for what?
how do you know that?
I will prove it, Liv.
that i love you.
always.
but not just yet.
you're just gonna have to wait.
there were weight sensors in the elevator.
so just before impact, the car weighed 1, 440 pounds.
the combined weight of the victims, 1,275 pounds.
leaving a discrepancy of 165 pounds.
meaning someone walked out of there alive.
okay.
somebody got lucky.
so what?
Walter's theoretical test subject.
I think he's real and that this might be him.
the only problem with that scenario is that it doesn't make sense.
if he was in the elevator car, he should've been electrocuted just like everybody else.
and that's if the impact didn't kill him first.
not necessarily.
if this person is both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current,
then it could well induce a form of electrodynamic levitation.
that's the technology behind maglev trains.
they essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion.
so he floated.
like my necklace in the elevator?
um, no, but...
it is possible that he could've levitated long enough to escape the brunt of the impact.
that still doesn't make sense.
if you can sabotage machines, you wouldn't sabotage one you're in.
unless it was unintentional.
an accident.
maybe whoever we're looking for isn't in control of their abilities.
maybe they don't even know what they're doing.
then we shouldn't be looking for big events.
we should be looking for small ones.
unintentional ones.
Oh, come on!
damn it!
just a small discharge.
negligible compared to the voltage coursing through that elevator.
I say we need to find this person and soon.
before he finds out exactly what he's capable of.
wool socks.
Charlie, thanks for waking up the team.
sure, look, we got reports of anomalies clustered around the outlying parts of Worcester and the Herndon building.
parking garage, gates, automatic doors, a few CCTVs.
well, we need more.
enough to discern a pattern.
you know, saying somebody's doing all this.
you do know that's crazy, right?
if it weren't, we wouldn't be looking for him.
mom.
what time is it?
where the hell have you been?
mom.
I think i made a big mistake.
you?
surprise.
no, pl-- please just listen to me.
please.
a few months ago, I was reading this magazine,
and there was this ad in the back about tapping into your hidden potential, you know?
and I--I figured it couldn't hurt.
so I went down to this office.
they did some tests.
did you give them money?
no, just listen-- what the hell's the matter with you?
they put me under some hypnosis.
I don't know.
and they--they said they were gonna, uh, realign the electrical impulses of my brain.
make it mimic a more confident person.
Oh-- no, but they did something to me!
they changed me.
I can't remember.
and now all these things have been happening.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
what do I-- I'm dying-- stop it!
get a hold of your-- damn it, mom!
for once, please!
please help me.
pills.
Oh, my god,
no, no, no, please.
pills.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
you don't have to be scared, Joseph.
we want to help you.
we're here to adjust your medication.
you did this to me.
what did you-- ah!
looking for anything unusual.
systems going offline, random power surges.
Hey, I've got another incident.
hold on.
bicoastal parcel.
guy lost his hand in a conveyor malfunction.
bicoastal parcel?
Yeah.
I gotta call you back.
what?
Herndon building security sign-in sheet.
bicoastal parcel.
she was found dead.
a pacemaker malfunction.
Olivia thinks they may have found our guy.
Yeah, now we just have to find him.
time of death was around 1: 15 a. m.
so god knows where he could be by now.
ask her what's visible in the event perimeter.
electronic, specifically.
Walter wants to know what's in the apartment.
what kind of gadgets.
uh, specifically electronics.
um, okay, there's a answering machine.
an answering machine.
telephone.
telephone.
boom box.
boom box.
fan.
fan.
B--boom box.
that's a device for playing music.
cassette tapes, yes?
Yes, but now's not really the time.
anything else, Olivia?
television.
a television.
lamps.
a lamp.
pay attention, would you?
we're doing this for you.
tell Olivia to come home.
I know how to find him.
so...
so what is this?
this is the sort of work I was born for.
you were hoping for something more specific, maybe?
everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint.
I said that, yes?
but it is limited.
barely traceable, except in people like Mr.
what's his name?
but since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced,
he'll give off a stronger signal than your average joe.
so what's that got to do with the cassette tape?
the cassette tape is as simple as it gets.
once exposed to a magnetic field, it remains permanently magnetized.
given the strength of mister...Meegar's electromagnetic signature,
plus his proximity to the tape,
I have little doubt that that cassette has been imprinted with Meegar's electrical signature.
it--it's kind of like when a film camera double-exposes a picture.
now we just take out the music and see what we have left.
wait, wait, wait-- there it is.
that's him.
that's mister...
Yes.
now to find Meegar.
how?
birds.
wait, you mean that pigeon thing?
you believe we can find him using pigeons?
it's possible.
as I've said, I can program carrier pigeons to track a stRong electromagnetic field.
we have his signature.
now all we need are birds.
I--I wish you told me earlier, because then I could've been working on it.
so how many?
not many.
two dozen.
two dozen.
great.
wait...
where am i?
tell Fischer he woke up.
what is-- what is this place?
Hey, what are you doing?
what are you-- no, no, no!
no, wait, no--please! Please, please, please!
you ready?
Yes, ideal.
Walter, you're not gonna accidentally fry one of those pigeons?
stranger things have happened.
that's his motto.
as I said, pigeons contain traces of magnetite in their beaks.
like hundreds of tiny compass needles.
the tesla coils will create an artificial electromagnetic field,
which I have already matched with mister...Uh, whatever's unique signature,
and will now imprint onto the pigeon.
so we set all of these birds free and they...
fly to Joseph Meegar.
Yeah, I know.
me too.
I'll believe it when I see it.
step back.
work to be done.
GPS chip's ready?
Yep.
so we're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons to find a man who can control electricity?
I have you to thank for that, don't i?
Yeah, that's me.
No!
you listened.
you're not real.
the last time we spoke, you listened.
you stay the hell away from me.
I didn't betray you.
you know that.
in your heart.
you know I wasn't the one.
Hey.
I think this bird thing might actually work.
you okay?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks.
did I miss anything?
I think the show's about to start.
I know we've only been together for a short time,
but I think I'm going to miss them.
such majestic creatures.
they're rats with wings.
you'll get over it.
all right, GPS is active.
excellent.
then we're ready.
ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
start it up.
come on, come on.
are you sure this is gonna work?
of course not.
seriously, if this works-- you're gonna have some more faith in your father?
no.
so what do we do now?
we gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe.
genius.
and we're in.
and there are the birds.
I don't see them.
Yeah, we lost the birds.
they're going northwest towards mill street.
we're approaching mill now.
uh, make a left.
take a left.
I see them.
all right, we got them.
I see them.
glad you got the car washed?
Ah!
Ah!
what is that?
it is unfair.
and I appreciate that.
the position you find yourself in now must be so surreal for you.
Oh, my god!
what did you do to me?
my head...
hurts so much.
those had to be subdermal.
they can be removed later.
what am I doing here?
No-no-no--ah!
you don't realize what you are.
I'm scared.
okay?
you wanted to be confident.
that's why you came to us.
no, I don't want to be confident.
I don't need to be confident.
but you are now.
I just want my life back!
I just want to go back to how it was, please!
look what science has made you, Joseph.
you are special.
no.
make a right on tempest.
take your next right.
all right, I think they've stopped.
there.
all right, I got them.
I see them.
okay, we're heading there now.
then our work is done.
good luck.
Hey, you stay here.
whatever you say, boss.
I'm not gonna ask.
good.
what is it?
visitors.
front entrance.
take him out through the back.
wait at the depot.
you'll be contacted there.
what about you?
he's the priority.
no movement.
stand back.
where are you taking me?
get in.
get in the car!
get those hands up.
I said get your hands in the air.
where is he?
I'm sorry.
who?
take upstairs.
we'll go around.
Freeze!
stop!
stop or i will shoot!
they're gonna keep him heavily sedated for a while.
don't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing.
Mr. Meegar.
miss, no one will tell me where I'm going.
to the hospital.
they're going to perform some exams.
check to see that your head's okay.
and then I'm gonna have some questions for you.
I want to go home.
I didn't want to hurt anybody.
we're going to help you.
that's what they said.
please...
I want to go home.
I'm afraid we can't let you do that.
that one can go out the back.
thank you, my dear.
what's my name?
starts with "A."
yes?
I knew it.
Ah, Olivia.
Peter told me to tell you, if I saw you, that he was returning the pigeons.
What's-- it's milk.
from gene.
do you want some?
I'll pass.
are you certain?
Mm-hmm.
hmm.
the color in your face.
you're looking a little pallid.
are you feeling well?
fine.
I'm a little tired.
that's all.
well, I don't yet know you well enough to ask this, but, uh...
you haven't seemed yourself lately.
I haven't been sleeping very well.
I've been...
nothing.
see you tomorrow.
you've been seeing him.
your friend.
I'm not surprised.
there is a reason.
I've been having hallucinations.
no.
not hallucinations.
what's happening?
I can't be sure.
the brain is a mystery.
but I believe when you were in the tank, John Scott...
that part of his consciousness crossed over into yours.
and it's still there.
his memories.
experiences, thoughts.
you understand me, yes?
these aren't memories.
he appears right in fRont of me.
he talks to me.
Yes, he would.
like a waking dream.
because he doesn't belong there.
there's only room for one voice in your head, not two.
this is your brain's way of working it out.
your mind is expelling him.
his thoughts.
he'll go away.
is that what you're saying?
I don't know.
do you really want him to?
our team's still cataloging all the files that we found in the cellar.
apparently John Scott was conducting his own investigations.
did the files give any indication of who he might've been working for?
not that we can see.
but it appears that many of the cases were pattern-related.
he knew about the pattern.
he also knew about our friend dr. Fischer.
in fact, he knew quite a bit more than we did.
including seven other potential josephs that Fischer was subjecting to treatments.
fortunately, none of them had activated yet.
we were able to locate all seven.
medical services is examining them now.
but they appear to be fine, thanks to you.
Fischer's still refusing to cooperate,
but I suspect six weeks in solitary might change his mind.
well, I hope you're right about that.
and there was also something else.
John Scott's personal effects.
it would seem some of them were intended for you.
I will prove it, Liv, that I love you.
always.
WORESTER, MASS.
you're gonna be late!
Oh, look at yourself.
tuck in your shirt.
put a comb through your hair, for God's sake.
Dara's son, he always takes care of his appearance.
meager. - It's mee-gar.
late again and you're making personal calls?
Oh, no, I'm-- - who's this?
nobody.
she your girlfriend? - No, she came with the phone.
what are you stalking this girl?
no.
are you kidding me?
Aw, come on. Unbelievable. Two in one week.
your sweep's leaving, meager.
get on it... or get another gig.
Hi, how are you today?
and we're still on for the regional manager's meeting Tomorrow at 4: 00?
great.
Yeah, thank you. Okay, great.
okay, thank you. Bye-bye.
Oh, I'm so-- I did not mean to interrupt.
no problem.
don't you usually have the little tablet thingy with you?
ye. Uh, I usually do.
is there something else, or...
I used to be a webelo.
And?
um, the webelos... cub scouts? Your brownie patch.
Oh, yeah.
no, I-- I actually found that online.
it's kitschy, right? I was gonna put it on one of my jackets.
Oh, that's-- oh, that's, uh-- yeah, that's cool.
Hey, bethany, we still on for drinks tonight?
of course. You better not keep me out too late this time.
we'll see.
no, no, no, no. No, no, please. Don't do this to me!
no. What happened? Damn it! Oh, my god!
do not crash on me. This is not happening.
hold it! Hold it! Please hold the elevator.
I've got to find an I. T. Guy. This is a disaster.
Oh, you dropped your ph
are you okay? - Get away from me!
no.
stop it! Stop it!
stop it!
Boston MASS
I'm telling you because you knew about john and you didn't say anything, so I trust you.
at least enough for me to not think you're gonna think I'm crazy.
Oh, of course not.
I saw him last night.
you saw john.
Yes, in my kitchen.
Hello, Liv.
I grabbed my gun, but he was gone.
I know he wasn't there. Obviously.
I--I just
let me see. You fall in love with your partner who betrays you... and your country.
he dies in your arms.
then he shows up in your kitchen and you're wondering if that's grounds to recuse yourself.
Yeah, okay, well, we can start with that.
I say no.
you're the one that exposed him.
bare minimum, that makes you indispensable.
you want my ad ce?
next time John shows up for a nightcap...give him one.
I'm being serious. - So am I.
you think a few weeks pass and everything you went through just goes away?
don't fight it.
don't beat yourself up.
you're good at that.
that's a character flaw.
it'll get easier.
H...
did she say what it was about?
Olivia? No. She'll tell us when she gets here.
how are you feeling?
never been better.
you look quite the opposite.
maybe that's because I had a little trouble sleeping last night.
Oh, I had trouble sleeping myself.
I was thinking about that man.
the one who tortured you.
something about him.
so familiar.
Peter, when I was in st. Claire's
we don't have to talk about this. It's not important.
but it is important.
you cannot imagine what it's like for a man like me to not have access to parts of his mind.
you're doing fine, Walter.
Dr. Bishop. Peter.
Ah, visiting hours.
everybody put on their best straight jacket.
at approximately 10: 17 A. M.
a massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise in worcester, massachusetts.
as a result, an elevator on the 26th floor plummeted straight to the basement.
eight passengers died.
did the cable snap?
that's what's strange.
the elevator didn't fall.
it drove itself into the ground.
that's not possible.
nine months ago, a maglev train in Tokyo plowed through a crowded station.
n error.
in reality, caused by a power surge of unknown origin.
intelligence chatter speculated that it might be a demonstration of a new weapon technology.
it's possible that this morning's event was another demonstration.
to override the elevator's circuitry would require a discharge of immense power and precision.
I've made arrangements for you to be received at the building.
we need to know what happened, how it happened, and who's behind it.
I'm peter simmons, the building's engineer.
Olivia dunham, FBI.
this is my team, peter bishop and Dr. Walter bishop.
so you've been briefed on what's happened?
damn elevator powered itself into the floor. Never seen anything like it.
shouldn't the brakes have come on automatically?
well, that's the thing. They did.
I mean, the safety's clamped onto the rails all right, but for some reason, the motor just kept going.
nearly melted the shoes, which is technically
impossible?
Yeah, we're seeing a lot of that lately.
you know your elevators.
mit drop-out.
is there any security camera footage?
Nope. All the cameras fritzed.
Hey, can you people move out of there?
FBI coming through.
so how could an elevator drive itself?
it's almost like another generator came online, jacked into the system, and overloaded it with double or triple the voltage.
exit wound burns.
Subconjuctival hemorrhages.
what are you two saying?
he's saying that all these people were electrocuted.
electrocuted.
may I?
that's lovely. 24 carat gold.
traces of nickel, possibly cobalt.
how are you doing that?
this entire space is charged with electromagnetic energy.
far beyond that which occurs in nature.
there's still residual magnetic energy from whatever electrocuted these people.
I need to examine the victims' belongings.
and one of the bodies as well.
are you saying you may know how this happened?
no, not yet.
but I can tell you every one of the passengers in this elevator was dead by the time they hit the ground.
I've worked on a project where I've seen this before.
the government had asked me if it was possible to make a human being trackable by pigeons.
like homing pigeons?
what possible use could that serve?
well, I'm sure it had something to do with the commies.
it always did back then.
regardless, our theory was that human beings are merely highly complex electrical systems.
battery, please, olivia.
the heart, the brain driven by electrical impulses.
and because everyone has a unique electromagnetic signature, like a fingerprint, then we theorized that properly altered, pigeons should be able to hone into that signature.
like the way they know how to fly south for the winter.
precisely.
but the human field was too weak, so we tried to augment it and make it strong enough for the birds to detect.
did it work?
Oh, yes.
but the side effects negated our plans.
there was one test subject, every time she hiccupped, the lights would dim.
so you're saying these people could control electronic devices?
no, not deliberately.
but I did surmise that it should be possible.
did you just make that thingome back to life?
no, not in this particular instance.
but it does confirm my theory.
what theory?
didn't I say? - No.
well, someone has pursued this idea.
they have amplified a person's electromagnetic field.
and in fact, it is the residual energy from that person that is making this heart pump.
and further, it is that person who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator.
so you don't think it was a weapon that electrocuted those people?
no. It was a human being.
accident occurred just after 10: 00 A. M. here at the herndon building in downtown worcester.
Hey, Ron wanted to see you.
haven't yet been released, dropped 26 stories to their death when the building's elevator system failed catastrophically.
what's wrong with you?
you look sick.
excuse me, Mr. Boynton.
where have you been?
excuse me?
do you remember last week what I said to you?
the words I used? How sympathetic I was?
what did I-- what did I say?
that--that you-- yeah, that you were watching my performance.
I said you had to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule.
because the system here, even when things are working, depends on people like you being, at the very least, reliable.
I've--I've-- had a really hard day.
guess what?
your day is fantastic compared to mine.
no, it's not.
what the hell's on your uniform? - What?
what is that?
I don't--I don't know. And I'm--I'm not sure.
I'll tell you what. I'll make it easy.
it's not your uniform anymore.
get your ass down to the locker-- - wait.
take it off and leave it there.
no, but--but please.
I take care of my mother.
Yeah, and I take care of my family.
and one of the ways I do that is to employ smart, reliable, capable people.
and you are none of those things. - Please.
you're fired. Go.
Mr. Boyn-- - get outta here, Meager.
I don't want to see you in this building anymore.
get the hell outta here!
here.
Thanks.
I thought you left hours ago.
I could say the same about you.
what are you reading?
neural distortion in human subjects.
and what's all this for?
I'm just trying to wrap my head around an idea Walter had.
he believes that it may be a person who was responsible for the herndon incident.
not a person wielding some kind of device.
a person who has somehow developed the ability to affect, or maybe even control, electrical devices.
and I suppose the good doctor has a theory how that's possible.
he thinks this person was altered in some way.
extensive procedures. Chemical therapy.
what?
in the course of investigating other pattern cases, we've come across a handful of clinics.
off the grid operations that solicited clients by making the same kinds of claims you see advertised on TV at 3: 00 A. M.
only they weren't actually providing weight loss or hair growth.
what were they really doing?
have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer?
no.
doctor of biotechnology.
wanted in four states and three countries for illegal human experimentation.
surgical alterations, radical hormone therapy.
using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs.
one subject was pumped full of stimulants and kept awake for a solid year.
fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images.
I only bring it up because if Dr. Bishop is right, and there is a person with these extraordinary capabilities, it might very well be that someone made him this way.
I'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer.
I'll have them transferred to your terminal.
but it's not easy stuff to look at.
Hello?
Hey, Liv.
it's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
I know this doesn't make any sense to you.
even if it did, I know you don't have any reason to trust me.
but that's what I'm asking you to do.
we don't have much time.
I'm here to help.
you tried to kill me.
no, Liv.
I loved you.
you know that.
you know I loved you.
I did. Always.
I can prove it to you.
but not here. It's
it's just not the way it works.
you're on the right track.
I'm here to tell you that.
you're looking for a person, but Jacob Fischer is after him also.
you need to get to him first, before Fischer can use him.
use him for what?
use him for what?
how do you know that?
I will prove it, Liv.
that I love you. Always.
but not just yet. You're just gonna have to wait.
maximum...
there were weight sensors in the elevator.
so just before impact, the car weighed 1, 440 pounds.
the combined weight of the victims, 1, 275 pounds.
leaving a discrepancy of 165 pounds.
meaning someone walked out of there alive.
okay. Somebody got lucky. So what?
Walter's theoretical test subject.
I think he's real and that this might be him.
the only problem with that scenario is that it doesn't make sense.
if he was in the elevator car, he should've been electrocuted just like everybody else.
and that's if the impact didn't kill him first.
not necessarily.
if this person is both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current, then it could well induce a form of electrodynamic levitation.
that's the technology behind maglev trains.
they essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion.
so he floated.
like my necklace in the elevator?
um, no, but...
it is possible that he could've levitated long enough to escape the brunt of the impact.
that still doesn't make sense.
if you can sabotage machines, you wouldn't sabotage one you're in.
unless it was unintentional.
an accident.
maybe whoever we're looking for isn't in control of their abilities.
maybe they don't even know what they're doing.
then we shouldn't be looking for big events. We should be looking for small ones.
unintentional ones.
Oh, come on! Damn it!
just a small discharge.
negligible compared to the voltage coursing through that elevator.
I say we need to find this person and soon.
before he finds out exactly what he's capable of.
wool socks.
Charlie, thanks for waking up the team.
sure, look, we got reports of anomalies clustered around the outlying parts of worcester and the herndon building.
parking garage, gates, automatic doors, a few cctvs.
well, we need more. Enough to discern a pattern.
you know, saying somebody's doing all this.
you do know that's crazy, right?
if it weren't, we wouldn't be looking for him.
Mmm, Joseph. - Mom.
what time is it?
where the hell have you been? - Mom.
I think I made a big mistake.
you? Surprise.
no, pl-- please just listen to me. Please.
a few months ago, I was reading this magazine, and there was this ad in the back about tapping into your hidden potential, you know?
and I--I figured it couldn't hurt.
so I went down to this office.
they did some tests. - Did you give them money?
no, just listen
what the hell's the matter with you?
they put me under some hypnosis. I don't know.
and they--they said they were gonna, uh, realign the electrical impulses of my brain.
make it mimic a more confident person.
no, but they did something to me! They changed me. I can't remember.
and now all these things have been happening.
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
what do I-- I'm dying
stop it! Get a hold of your-- - damn it, mom!
for once, please! Please help me.
pills.
Oh, my god, oh, my god. No, no, no, please.
pills.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
you don't have to be scared, Joseph. We want to help you.
we're here to adjust your medication.
you did this to me. What did you
what...
looking for anything unusual.
systems going offline, random power surges.
Hey, I've got another incident.
hold on.
guy lost his hand in a conveyor malfunction.
bicoastal parcel? - Yeah.
I gotta call you back.
what?
Herndon building security sign-in sheet.
she was found dead.
a pacemaker malfunction.
Olivia thinks they may have found our guy.
Yeah, now we just have to find him.
time of death was around 1: 15 A. M.
so god knows where he could be by now.
ask her what's visible in the event perimeter.
electronic, specifically.
Walter wants to know what's in the apartment.
what kind of gadgets. uh, specifically electronics.
um, okay, there's a answering machine.
an answering machine.
telephone. - Telephone.
boom box. - Boom box.
fan. - Fan.
B--boom box. That's a device for playing music.
cassette tapes, yes?
Yes, but now's not really the time.
anything else, Olivia? - Television.
a television.
lamps. - a lamp.
pay attention, would you? We're doing this for you.
tell Olivia to come home.
I know how to find him.
so... so what is this?
this is the sort of work I was born for.
you were hoping for something more specific, maybe?
everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint.
I said that, yes?
but it is limited.
barely traceable, except in people like Mr.
what's his name?
but since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced, he'll give off a stronger signal than your average joe.
so what's that got to do with the cassette tape?
the cassette tape is as simple as it gets.
once exposed to a magnetic field, it remains permanently magnetized.
given the strength of mister Meegar's electromagnetic signature, plus his proximity to the tape,
I have little doubt that that cassette has been imprinted with Meegar's electrical signature.
it--it's kind of like when a film camera double-exposes a picture.
now we just take out the music and see what we have left.
wait, wait, wait-- there it is.
that's him. That's mister... Meegar. Yes.
now to find Meegar.
how? - Birds.
wait, you mean that pigeon thing?
you believe we can find him using pigeons?
it's possible.
as I've said, I can program carrier pigeons to track a strong electromagnetic field.
we have his signature.
now all we need are birds.
I--I wish you told me earlier, because then I could've been working on it.
so how many?
not many. Two dozen.
two dozen. Great.
wait... where am I?
tell Fischer he woke up.
what is-- what is this place?
Hey, what are you doing?
what are you-- no, no, no! No, wait, no--please! Please, please, please!
you ready?
Yes, ideal.
Walter, you're not gonna accidentally fry one of those pigeons?
stranger things have happened.
that's his motto.
as I said, ons contain tracesof magnetite in their beaks.
like hundreds of tiny compass needles.
the tesla coils will create an artificial electromagnetic field, which I have already matched with mister...
uh, whatever's unique signature, and will now imprint onto the pigeon.
so we set all of these birds free and they fly to Joseph Meegar.
Yeah, I know. Me too. I'll believe it when I see it.
step back. Work to be done.
GPS chip's ready? - Yep.
so we're putting gps chips on carrier pigeons to find a man who can control electricity?
I have you to thank for that, don't I?
Yeah, that's me.
No!
you listened.
you're not real.
the last time we spoke, you listened.
you stay the hell away from me.
I didn't betray you.
you know that. In your heart.
you know I wasn't the one.
I think this bird thing might actually work.
you okay?
Yeah.
Hey, Charlie.
Oh, thanks.
did I miss anything?
I think the show's about to start.
I know we've only been together for a short time, but I think I'm going to miss them.
such majestic creatures.
they're rats with wings.
you'll get over it.
all right, GPS is active.
excellent. Then we're ready.
ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
start it up.
come on, come on.
are you sure this is gonna work?
of course not.
seriously, if this works
you're gonna have some more faith in your father?
no.
so what do we do now?
we gotta tie the gps to the mainframe.
genius.
and we're in.
and there are the birds.
I don't see them.
Yeah, we lost the birds.
they're going northwest towards Mill street.
we're approaching Mill now.
uh, make a left.
take a left.
I see them.
all right, we got them. I see them.
glad you got the car washed?
what is that?
it is unfair. And I appreciate that.
the position you find yourself in now must be so surreal for you.
Oh, my god! What did you do to me? My head... hurts so much.
those had to be subdermal. They can be removed later.
what am I doing here?
you don't realize what you are.
I'm scared. Okay?
you wanted to be confident.
that's why you came to us.
no, I don't want to be confident.
I don't need to be confident.
but you are now.
I just want my life back!
I just want to go back to how it was, please!
look what science has made you, Joseph.
you are special. - No.
make a right on Tempest.
take your next rig.
all right, I think they've stopped.
there.
all right, I got them. I see them.
okay, we're heading there now.
then our work is done. Good luck.
Hey, you stay here.
whatever you say, boss.
I'm not gonna ask. - Good.
what is it?
visitors. Front entrance.
take him out through the back. Wait at the depot. You'll be contacted there.
what about you? - He's the priority.
no movement.
stand back.
where are you taking me?
get in. Get in the car!
get those hands up.
I said get your hands in the air.
where is he?
I'm sorry. Who?
take upstairs.
we'll go around.
Freeze!
stop!
stop !
they're gonna keep him heavily sedated for a while.
don't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing.
Mr. Meegar.
miss, no one will tell me where I'm going.
to the hospital.
they're going to perform some exams.
check to see that your head's okay.
and then I'm gonna have some questions for you.
I want to go home.
I didn't want to hurt anybody.
we're going to help you.
that's what they said.
please... I want to go home.
I'm afraid we can't let you do that.
that one can go out the back. Thank you, my dear.
what's my name?
starts with "A." Yes?
Astrid. - I knew it.
Peter told me to tell you, if I saw you, that he was returning the pigeons.
it's milk. From gene. Do you want some?
I'll pass. - Are you certain?
the color in your face. You're looking a little pallid.
are you feeling well?
fine.
I'm a little tired. That's all.
well, I don't yet know you well enough to ask this, but, uh...
you haven't seemed yourself lately.
I haven't been sleeping very well.
I've been...
nothing.
see you tomorrow.
you've been seeing him.
your friend. John Scott.
I'm not surprised.
there is a reason.
I've been having hallucinations.
no. Not hallucinations.
what's happening?
I can't be sure.
the brain is a mystery.
but I believe when you were in the tank, that part of his consciousness crossed over into yours.
and it's still there.
his memories.
experiences, thoughts.
you understand me, yes?
these aren't memories.
he appears right in front of me. He talks to me.
Yes, he would.
like a waking dream.
because he doesn't belong there.
there's only room for one voice in your head, not two.
this is your brain's way of working it out.
your mind is expelling him.
exorcising his thoughts.
he'll go away. Is that what you're saying?
I don't know.
do you really want him to?
our team's still cataloging all the files that we found in the cellar.
apparently John Scott was conducting his own investigations.
did the files give any indication of who he might've been working for?
not that we can see.
but it appears that many of the cases were pattern-related.
he knew about the pattern.
he also knew about our friend Dr. Fischer.
in fact, he knew quite a bit more than we did.
including seven other potential Josephs that Fischer was subjecting to treatments.
fortunately, none of them had activated yet.
we were able to locate all seven.
medical services is examining them now.
but they appear to be fine, thanks to you.
Fischer's still refusing to cooperate, but I suspect six weeks in solitary might change his mind.
well, I hope you're right about that.
and there was also something else.
John Scott's personal effects.
it would seem some of them were intended for you.
I will prove it, Liv, that I love you.
always.
Nixon AIDE. Well, I think, if they...
Nixon... Internal Revenue people that are kicking
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
he is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
he went on television.
I have not. I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the Chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
every one of those sons of bitches.
Nixon. Well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
man. Yeah.
Nixon... or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
and we're gonna want to run with it.
news REPORTER 1. A controversial day in politics.
a man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
he is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
and guess what else he is.
a consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
news REPORTER 2. The trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
CAMERAMAN: Stand by for camera.
Mudd. John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
Dean. At one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
news REPORTER 3. Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution, and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
lawyer. The misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
and consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
news REPORTER 4. The President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
out is H. R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
news REPORTER 5. Good morning. The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
it is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
it's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
a White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
these are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
this is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
you see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
president Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
white HOUSE DIRECTOR: 15 seconds, Mr. President.
okay, that's five, four, three...
good evening. This is the 37th time
I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
my father called. The phone rang, my father called and he said, "Turn on the TV right now. Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
we stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
and then finally, it had come to this.
therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
but instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
there was no apology.
little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
Nixon: To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
and that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
but he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
he understood television.
announcer. And now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
thank you, thank you.
hello. Good evening.
and with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
the Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
now, my first guest tonight...
well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
he'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
he ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
FROST: Next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
we'll see you then. God bless.
great show, David. Thanks, Noah.
Noah: Come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
news REPORTER. A dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
what, this is live? Yeah.
news REPORTER. But those were triumphs. This is not.
what time is it in Washington?
9: 00 a. m.
why didn't he wait?
it's 6: 00 in the morning on the West Coast.
half his audience is still asleep.
all right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
news REPORTER... are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
find out the numbers for this, will you? Worldwide.
Brennan. I remember his face.
staring out the window.
down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
they'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
so what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
fish and chips, please.
and in a moment...
well, it's too late now. It's done.
I've called his people...
you?
beans, peas and lamb, please.
and made an offer.
now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
so it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
so who is it?
richard Nixon.
richard Nixon?
well, come on, don't look like that.
well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
weren't they terrific?
come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
so, okay, so what kind of interview?
a full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
and what? Come on, David.
surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
a full, no-holds-barred confession.
well, we'll get that, too.
from Richard Nixon?
come on, John.
just think of the numbers it would get.
do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
four hundred million.
but in the end, David heard nothing.
and soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
president of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
it meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
it was like he slipped out the back door.
a public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
chancellor. One telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal, "Truman had his Fair Deal, now Ford has his crooked deal.
there was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
the American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
GANNON: So how do we want to address the college protests?
well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
sir? GANNON: You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
SAWYER: Just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
okay. No, no, stick around.
you're gonna get a kick out of this.
this is my literary agent from Hollywood.
hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
nice to see you.
these are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
nice to meet you. Miss Sawyer.
pleasure. Mr. Gannon.
okay, that's it. I'll see you after lunch.
SWIFTY: So how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you. Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God. I despise that game.
imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
never retire, Mr. Lazar.
to me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
no purpose.
what makes life mean something is purpose.
a goal. A battle. A struggle.
well, even if you don't win it.
when my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
well, they were wrong.
that was the lowest I got.
well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
how to spend $2 million, 2. 3 to be precise.
it's what I got for your memoirs.
well, thank you.
eh...
it might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
that book is important to me.
it's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
you know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
Nixon: Who?
david Frost. English talk show guy.
why would I want to talk to David Frost?
well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
no.
well, we didn't get back to him.
frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
we are. I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
it would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
true, true. Could probably get more money.
Really? Look.
we'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
but if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
it'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
we tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
we buried him alive, and he walked free.
today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
my name is David Frost.
director: Okay, that is a cut.
thank you.
in any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
to assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
if they take the call, you know they're desperate.
and from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost? Irving Lazar.
who?
swifty Lazar. I represent President Nixon.
what time is it?
bad time?
No! Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really? Well, that's terrific news!
for God's sake.
swifty. I got $500, 000.
is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
it's unprecedented.
yeah? Well, what's the catch?
with Frost? None. It'll be a big wet kiss.
this guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
BIRT: David, how could you have done that? What?
$600, 000. That's a fortune.
don't worry about the money.
my God. Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
you're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks. They're just jealous.
they're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
and if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
no syndication, no advance sales.
no advance sales, no commercials.
no commercials, no revenue.
and here's the bigger question, why do it? You don't need it.
your career's in great shape.
this will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes. And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
this would be... What?
you wouldn't understand, John.
you were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
and the emptiness when it's gone.
and the sickening thought that it may never come back.
you know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
you know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
man: Excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
would you mind? Of course.
but I don't. I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
and that is what makes me nervous.
and you do nervous so beautifully, John.
Hello, good evening and welcome.
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
champagne?
CAROLINE: No, thank you.
flight ATTENDANT: Another glass, sir?
you don't like champagne?
not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
the trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
like the Viennese serve coffee.
well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh. Well, you'd like it.
it's like Paris without the French.
what's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know. David Frost.
hello and good evening and welcome.
you know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
you were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
on the phone.
they said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really? Mmm.
you and Vidal Sassoon.
but what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
how kind. Mmm-hmm.
and that you fly around a great deal.
well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
you know, you have very sad eyes.
do I? Mmm.
has anyone told you that before?
no.
are you a sad person?
let's talk about you a little bit.
of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
how right you are!
this is your captain speaking.
you may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
if you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly. Thank you.
CAROLINE: So how about you? Where are you going?
to meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
you know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
where is he now?
in some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
actually, no. In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really? Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
how incongruous.
you can come if you'd like.
to meet Nixon?
why not?
are you sure?
you know, I would love that.
pilot. Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
he did, too. Money no object.
everything glittered and was golden.
well, on the outside.
of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
look, we love your work as an entertainer.
that Guinness show?
love it. You're a funny guy.
but an interview like this?
you're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
he never let on to anyone at the time, not even me. You know, that would have meant...
Thanks.
...admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
FROST: There you are.
see, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
well.
you found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
and you, sir.
may I present Caroline Cushing?Miss Cushing.
hello. Your house is very beautiful.
really. Very romantic.
well, thank you.
and my producer, John Birt.
nice to meet you. How do you do?
this is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please. I'd love that. Thank you.
come on in. This is my office.
now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah. Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
we talked for nine hours straight.
after the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
and the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
he crashed into curbs.
he went over speed bumps.
he went twice around my whole estate.
finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
he turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
he said, "Mr. President, most politicians have tragedy in their early lives."
well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
and he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
he was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
they never know when they're being taped.
okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
until March. I look forward to it.
well, thank you, Mr. President. So do I.
you know, it's a funny thing that I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
FROST: Yeah, well, not really.
of course it is.
and I like that.
no holds barred, eh? No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
of course.
I do beg your pardon.
right. $200, 000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
made out in the name of?
irving Paul Lazar.
richard M. Nixon.
here you go.
MANOLO: Okay, smile.
there. Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey. Take my advice.
you should marry that woman.
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?
more important than that, she comes from Monaco.
they pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye. Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
what?
come out of his own pocket.
you know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
so if you ask me, there's a good chance this whole thing may never happen.
Really? So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200, 000?
correct.
had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
say, did you notice his shoes?
no.
Italian. No laces. What do you think?
my people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
you do?
Yeah. Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
nbc EXECUTIVE. I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
try to look at it from our point of view.
why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see. Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
well, that's the networks out, all of them.
well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
the idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob. FROST: How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in. David's on the phone.
FROST: No, never been done before.
historic stuff.
just think about it, okay? And call me back.
yeah? Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
delighted to meet you.
come on in. Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
moving to ABC in the new year.
the general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
second on the subject.
fourth.
well, delighted to have you both aboard.
actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
what I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
that's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
isn't that enough?
well, not for me.
look, I'd be giving up a year of my life. I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
FROST: No, all right.
well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
difficult questions.
the man lost 21, 000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
he only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
you know...
right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
he devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
the American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
the integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
and if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
and that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
ZELNICK: Come on. Jim, come on.
thanks for that, Jim.
could you give us a couple of minutes?
you're unbelievable. I'm sorry, Bob.
you know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
sympathy for Richard Nixon?
what the... He's full of shit, man!
how do you know that?
is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
apparently.
why didn't you tell me?
it isn't relevant.
what's the angle? "British talk show host, "good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents.
that's the general idea, yeah.
right.
it's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
well, Bob's obviously a pro.
what are we gonna do about Reston?
well, the man's an idiot. He's overemotional.
send him home.
well, I think he should stay. Why?
I liked his passion.
he will drive us all bloody mad.
well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
he stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
and people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either. No.
particularly not in Mandarin.
so Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
and then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
and then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
and I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
it's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
yeah? How?
frost got there. He got the money.
what?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
but the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really? Now, that's terrific.
how much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%. Just one of four 90-minute shows.
what are the other three divided into?
domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
Nixon the Man?
as opposed to what? Nixon the horse?
well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now. The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
spare me.
still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
you're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
if this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
you think? I'm certain.
it would be so good to go back to where the action is.
you know?
the hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
it's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
that stuff's been combed over a million times.
no one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
what his strategy is.
now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
the Beverly Hilton, you say.
well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
Reston. A week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
and that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
Birt. And from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
who was the guy that Mike interviewed? Was that Haldeman?
BIRT: Haldeman. RESTON: Haldeman. And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
what is Haldeman's official... Hello, darling.
as for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
and David, we never really saw much of David.
RESTON: All right, so what about the Huston Plan?
you can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
that's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
wiretapping students.
Nixon ON TAPE. But they've traced the money to him.
RESTON: Opening people's mail.
what about wiretapping?
how many people has he wiretapped?
this guy wiretapped 17 people.
BIRT: Seventeen?
including his own brother.
but you know what? We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
RESTON: But wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
we have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
and that's Liddy, right?
we're going to need napkins. We'd better have some napkins.
how do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?
I think you should say, "How far do you take executive privilege "before it becomes an undemocratic event?
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
how do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?
FROST: Come on. Are they really interested in buying time?
are they going to give us the money?
how serious are they?
you have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
there's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
you know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
BIRT: Okay, the White House taping system.
lyndon Johnson's White House used them. So did Kennedy's.
HUSTON Plan. Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
and just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
that man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
and the American people, they loved him for it!
whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
look. Look. Now I'm sweating.
damn it! Damn it!
and Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
and women all over him!
he screwed anything that moved, and everything.
had a go at Checkers once.
the poor little bitch was never the same!
gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
CAROLINE: Jack Anderson in The Washington Post, "When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras "for his first interview since he abandoned the White House, "he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand."
frost has hired three crack investigators "to help him with the research."
clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches.
"crack investigators"?
can I be Crack One?
can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a second?
after researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
you know, Charles Colson? His darkest henchman?
Colson, right. Colson had a meeting with Nixon
sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
but if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
a week? Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
would there be something I could help you with?
you know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
we're gonna have to take him by surprise.
don't worry, Jim. We'll get him anyway.
hang on a second. David, Jack Brennan.
he sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
he'll be right with you. Yeah.
Jack. Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
you know what I'm talking about.
for the interviews.
we want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
hold on a minute.
so all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
correct.
that is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
okay. How would you define Watergate?
well, that it covers just that.
the Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
fine. In which case, the deal is off.
fine. In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
the terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75%
he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
drone on? Jesus Christ. Where's your respect?
you remember who you're talking about here.
you know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
you goddamn media people. You are so smug.
well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%,
I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
prick.
look at you. Gorgeous.
good night, sweet princes.
cheerio. Bye.
see you in the morning.
why the monkey suit?
david has a film premiere he needs to attend.
what? The night before we start taping?
what's the movie?
it's The Slipper and the Rose.
the Cinderella movie?
Yeah. David's the executive producer.
you don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
BIRT: Don't worry.
david is a performer of the highest caliber.
he's been in these pressure situations many times before.
come the hour, he'll be fine. Okay?
what did he say? Did he say "performer"?
Yeah. That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer.
not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
no. He said "performer.
out of curiosity, where are you at this moment? Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
so any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
just go right!
you could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
price: I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
excuse me, sir. Something I think you should see.
GANNON: People love that story.
SAWYER: Why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
reporter 1. David. REPORTER 2. Mr. Frost.
reporter 1. David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
what will you do if he stonewalls you?
frost. Well, I shall say so again and again.
but I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
reporter 1. "A cascade of candor"?
from Richard Nixon?
you think that's what you'll get?
no, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
reporter 1. So what about the money?
that's a strange fellow.
started life as a comic, you know.
Nixon: Is that so? Mmm-hmm.
almost married Diahann Carroll.
who?
GANNON: The singer.
isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
okay. Let's get back to work.
frost. That's fact, this is fiction.
so now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
it's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
just don't drink any more.
good luck. Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick. Wait.
FROST: For the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
why didn't you burn the tapes?
no. Fuck.
please, God, no! You can't.
David, you can't do that. It would be a disaster.
it would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
what is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
cause it's war, isn't it? Gloves off.
I like it. It's ballsy.
strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
it's insanely risky.
he could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
worse, he could sue you!
we were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
photographer: Right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
over here, sir!
here we go. OFFICER: Back up behind the curb.
reporter 1: A few questions, please.
photographer: Right here, Mr. Frost.
reporter 2: David! David! David!
FROST: Well, hello there.
excuse me, fellas.
man: Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
woman: Liar!
man: Here comes the President!
reporter 1: Mr. President!
reporter 2: Mr. President!
reporter 3: How are you feeling, Mr. President?
the Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
they talked to you about that, too?
they're bugging everybody.
RESTON: You know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
he's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
the least he could do is look ravaged.
you gonna shake his hand?
am I gonna shake...
are you kidding me?
after everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
gentlemen.
may I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
how do you do?
pleasure, Mr. President.
FROST: And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
excuse me, sir? Got a room for you right here.
Wow. That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
now this is your green room.
and the President will be on the large monitor.
craft services is that way.
keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
well, thank you. It's true.
she's much better now.
she's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
and from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
thank you.
as I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
well...
how much has it cost?
you mind me asking? Hey, come on.
come on, it's just between us.
very well. Two million.
two million? Jeez. I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
but tell me something.
you raised it all now?
not quite. But we're getting there.
everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
is that out of shot?
that's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question
I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
you're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
if you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
they say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
people who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
but television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
so now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
sixty seconds, everyone.
you trim yours? No.
no, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned. Yeah.
you got blue eyes. You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
no, not that I'm aware.
you were obviously born to be on the tube.
davis: Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
settling.
those shoes.
they're Italian, aren't they?
my shoes? I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
you don't find them too effeminate?
no.
well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
Mr. President. Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question, more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
why didn't you burn the tapes?
son of a bitch!
well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
but if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
what probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
I hadn't liked the idea at all, but the former President,
president Johnson, had repeatedly said how crazy it would be to remove the system, which he felt was the best way...
Brennan. Well, in boxing, you know, there's always that first moment, and you see it in the challenger's face.
it's that moment that he feels the impact from the champ's first jab.
it's kind of a sickening moment, when he realizes that all those months of pep talks and the hype, the psyching yourself up, had been delusional all along.
you could see it in Frost's face.
if he didn't know the caliber of the man that he was up against before the interview started, he certainly knew it halfway through the President's first answer.
Nixon: You see, since the best advice is almost always of the confidential variety, now the tapes have been made public, people are unlikely ever to feel comfortable speaking in confidence at the White House.
they're less likely to offer that advice. So in the end, it's the whole political system and, by implication, it's the country that suffers.
so when did you actually decide...
at what moment did you know you were going to resign?
that's good. That's good.
I remember exactly. It was July 23.
after it was clear the Southern Democrats that were still against impeachment had had the screws put on them by the Speaker of the House.
that night I said to Al Haig, "Well, that's it. There goes the presidency."
and, of course, you know, being Al, he tried to talk me out of it.
and Vice President Ford, I mean, let's not forget he had the most to gain personally from my stepping down, he was still absolutely convinced that we were gonna win the impeachment vote, and comfortably. John, we have to do something.
we have to move this along.
this is desperate, John. Do something.
twenty-three minutes on one question?
okay, let's take a break.
let's change the tapes. Come on, man.
stop tape.
we have to take a break. Tape change.
Oh. Okay, how's that? You getting what you need?
it's fantastic.
good. Good. Thank you.
excuse me. One moment, sir.
Nixon: Yeah, sure. Take your time.
what are you doing, David? You've got to stop him rambling.
it's all right. These are just introductory exchanges.
but this session only lasts two hours.
nearly half of it's gone, and we're wasting valuable material, okay?
the moment that he made the decision to resign, we should be scoring points with that stuff.
want me to switch to Vietnam?
no. No. We've got to get something out of that resignation night. All right?
that was Nixon at his lowest point, a total wreck. On his knees?
praying with Kissinger? Come on, you can nail him with that stuff.
listen, was that okay?
perfect, sir.
it didn't sound too arrogant or self-serving?
not at all. You sounded controlled, even-handed, statesmanlike.
good.
now continue exactly the same way.
long answers. Control the space.
don't let him in.
okay, got you.
davis: Set. And roll.
we're coming back on camera three in four, three, two and...
reading the account of those extraordinary final days, it seems your most emotional moment came in that heart-to-heart you had with Henry Kissinger.
was that perhaps the most emotional moment of your career?
RESTON: Good, good. NIXON. Yes.
I would say it was about as emotional a moment as I've ever had.
except, well, you know, it's hard to say what is the most emotional moment, because each is different.
I remember the day Eisenhower died.
for God's sake.
and the day I walked my eldest daughter Tricia down the aisle.
and the day during the impeachment hearings when Julie, that's my youngest, she came into my office, she threw her arms around me, she kissed me. She cried, you know?
and she so seldom cries.
she said, "Daddy, you're the finest man I know."
daddy, you're the finest man I know"?
and whatever you do, I will support you.
you just gotta go through the fire, you know, a little longer.
this is beautiful.
so Kissinger and I were in the Lincoln Sitting Room, and together we began to reminisce about some of the great decisions that we'd participated in.
there was China, the Soviet Union, the peace settlement in Vietnam.
now, let me tell you something that I never told anybody.
whenever I have had a really tough decision to make...
now, we were in the Lincoln Sitting Room at that time.
I have come into this room for the purpose of praying.
now, Henry, I'm a Quaker. You're a Jew.
neither of us is particularly orthodox, "but I'd like to think that each of us in our own way "has a deep religious sensitivity.
so if you don't mind, could we just have a moment of silent prayer?
so we knelt down. Now, this was in front of that table where Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
and then after a few moments, we both got up again, and Henry says...
is there... I'm sorry.
is there a problem?
that's time.
we're over two hours.
Really? So soon?
well, Mr. President, I gather our time is up.
gee, now, that's a pity.
you know, I was beginning to enjoy that.
that was terrific, both of you.
we're getting some great material.
you know, it's so funny, too, because I was expecting questions on Vietnam.
and we prepared for that, hadn't we, Jack?
Yes, so did I.
I guess we just got caught up, you know, reminiscing.
indeed.
so, day after tomorrow, 10: 00, right?
Yes, indeed.
I look forward to it. Bye-bye.
there's no need to say anything.
reporter 1: Mr. President! REPORTER 2: Mr. President!
reporter 3: Mr. President!
reporter 4: Mr. President, please!
what are you gonna tell him?
I'm gonna tell him he's gotta get involved.
he's gotta be able to shut him up. Shh.
David, we have some fundamental problems in our approach that I think...
don't worry, Bob. I'm on it.
we can use some of the Kissinger stuff.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
look, I'm disappointed, too.
but I wonder, could we possibly spare the post-mortem for now?
I don't mean to minimize it. It's just I've got to get back to LA to meet some people from Weed Eater.
Thanks, everyone! Great work!
Marv, Lloyd, great day. Bye, David.
I'll see you soon. God bless!
what the hell is Weed Eater?
it's a horticultural mechanism.
one of our sponsors.
what happened to Xerox?
what about General Motors or IBM?
I gather that not all of the blue-chip accounts came through.
we do have Alpo.
dog food?
wait, John. We're already taping.
so we're close, right? We're very close?
that's probably a question you should ask David.
are we close, John?
I believe we're at 30%.
to go? Or 30% sold?
again, that's probably a question you should...
sold, 30% sold.
Jesus...
I thought we were practically fully financed.
we were. But the financing was always conditional on advertising sales, and no one predicted that they'd fall apart like this.
well, why have they fallen apart? Based on what?
credibility of the project. What else are advertising sales based on?
listen, I understand your concern.
but could I ask you to go a little easier on David over the next couple of days, bearing in mind the extraordinary pressure that he's under?
cause at the moment, he's effectively paying for all this himself.
so he's in it for a lot more than just his reputation.
and we're not?
frost. You seemed very confident last time.
I don't understand. Why this sudden change of heart?
all right, this is just madness. It's Richard Nixon.
these interviews will do mid-30s audience share, minimum.
Jimmy! Yes. Yes, back again, like the proverbial bad penny.
look, I hate to do this to a friend, and I know you're already in for more than I asked for, but I need you to dig a little deeper.
I'm right up against it now.
so, I had a chance to review yesterday's tapes.
And?
honestly? Far too soft, David.
go on. Beat me, John. Beat me with a stick.
look. No, I'm serious.
you have got to make it more uncomfortable for him.
you can start by sitting forward. You've gotta attack more.
if he starts tailing off, bang, jump in with another question.
don't trade generalizations.
be specific.
and above all, don't let him give these self-serving, 23-minute homilies.
right. And keep your distance before the tape starts running.
he was toying with you yesterday.
all that shit about Ben-Hur and struggling to raise the money.
those are mind games. Don't engage.
never forget, you are in there with a major operator.
got it.
Ah.
the Grand Inquisitor!
no, just your friendly neighborhood confidant.
it's okay. We just blew a bulb.
Nixon: This is why I got all these Secret Service guys around.
there's nothing to worry about.
as a president, you get used to this kind of stuff.
davis: Ed, we gotta get in here and change out this 750, ASAP.
focus, sir. Yeah.
okay, we are back. Okay, take it on my count.
okay, stand by to roll tape. 30 seconds.
davis: Settling.
you have a pleasant evening last night?
Yes, thank you.
did you do any fornicating?
David, we're starting with camera two in four,
three, two and...
Mr. President, you came to office promising peace, but no sooner did you get into the White House than US involvement in Vietnam deepened and the war was prolonged with calamitous consequences.
did you feel that you'd betrayed the people that had elected you?
well, Vietnam was not my war.
it was my inheritance.
and it looked to me... Jump in.
...as if the reason for our being there had perhaps not been adequately understood by the American people.
it seemed to me they hadn't realized how important a test this was of American credibility.
the whole world was watching to see if we have the character to see it through.
now, look, I could have bugged out. I could have.
I could have blamed it on my predecessors.
I could have pulled the troops out of Vietnam early, and very possibly, I would have won some Scandinavian peace prize into the bargain.
but I believed in the cause.
and sometimes, you know, what you believe in, it's the harder path.
you might even say that I was the last casualty of the Vietnam War.
Yeah, tell that to the paraplegics.
come on, David, Cambodia.
and Cambodia? An invasion which everybody advised you against.
all the CIA and Pentagon intelligence suggested it would fail.
so why did you do it?
well, first of all, as a result of our incursion into Cambodia, we picked up 22, 000 rifles, 15 million rounds of ammunition, 150, 000 rockets, mortars.
that's all belonging to the North Vietnamese, which would only otherwise have been directed right onto American soldiers.
but one of the principal justifications you gave for the incursion was the supposed existence of the "headquarters of the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam,"
a sort of "bamboo Pentagon" which proved not to exist at all.
no, no. Wait a minute there. No, I was... And by sending...
and by sending B-52s to carpet bomb a country, wiping out whole civilian areas, you end up radicalizing a once moderate people, uniting them in anti-American sentiment and creating a monster in the Khmer Rouge that would lead to civil war...
all right! ...and genocide.
Yes, good, good, good. There it is.
okay, run VT.
roll tape.
well, sir, I'm sure you'd agree, some pretty stirring images there.
look, it was never US policy to kill civilians. That's the enemy's way.
well, I'm not suggesting...
and if you're asking the question do I regret the casualties on both sides in the war, yeah, sure, of course I do.
let me tell you something. It can just wear you down.
well, all right, sir, when you are faced with someone who...
but whenever I have had my doubts,
I remembered the construction worker in Philadelphia, because he came up to me and he said, "Sir, I got only one criticism of that Cambodia thing."
if you'd gone in earlier, you might have captured the gun that killed my boy three months ago.
so you're asking me, do I regret going into Cambodia?
No! I don't. You know what?
I wish I'd gone in sooner and harder.
SAWYER: Got him. Safe!
it was horrifying. It was horrifying. And he was so confident.
reporter: What are you gonna say about Watergate?
sorry, boys, just all talked out, you know?
better?
it was. Unquestionably better.
what's next?
foreign policy.
great. Russia, China, the big power stuff.
Yeah, so?
so if he beats him up like that on Vietnam, imagine what he's gonna do with his real achievements.
it ain't gonna be pretty.
the answer was grow by six inches.
it was agony to watch.
now, that's when Khrushchev called me, begging me to intervene.
you see, he and Mao didn't get along, and Khrushchev knew that the Chairman would talk to me, no one else.
you see, I was the only one that Mao would trust personally, man-to-man.
when David tried to lay a finger on him,
Nixon made mincemeat out of him.
ZELNICK: What "revolution," David?
you just let Richard Nixon claim the country was in a state of revolution?
what, with protestors "bombing" and "assaulting" police officers?
that's not how I remember it.
what I remember is people protesting peacefully and legitimately against the Vietnam War!
that's what I remember. Music off, please. Off.
by the end, wiretapping students and breaking into journalists' homes was beginning to sound like a rational response.
well, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I simply cannot share your view.
about what exactly?
about any of it, frankly!
I thought today was a huge improvement.
are you nuts?
let me tell you how bad things were today.
after the taping finished, I overheard two members of the crew say they never voted for him when they had the chance, but if he ran for office again today, he'd get their support.
you're making him look presidential, for Christ's sake!
and forget about the trivia, David.
who cares whether Nixon took the White House bed to Europe when he traveled? I do!
well, it's irrelevant!
and it's just the sort of banal anecdote that would distract a talk...
a what?
go on. No, say it.
what, you were gonna say "talk show host"?
Yeah. Yeah, I was.
all right, look, it's useless me trying to answer your points.
frankly, I don't share any of your sense of pessimism or alarm.
and this ridiculous self-flagellation, in my view, is just depressing.
No!
and threatening to derail the whole enterprise.
look. If there is anyone here who thinks we're gonna fail, they better leave now, or it'll infect everyone else.
no one?
right.
good.
now, I suggest instead of festering around the hotel for the next five days, we all go our separate ways over Easter.
but before we go, Caroline and I would like you to join us for a little celebratory dinner at Patrick Terrail's new place.
celebrate? Celebrate what, David?
the fact that we're all gonna be working at Burger King?
what are we celebrating? It's my birthday, Bob!
I'd like to celebrate my birthday with a few friends.
look, is that Neil Diamond?
frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
and is that Sammy Cahn?
go together like Prancer and Vixen
David, did you hear that?
soaring through the airwaves
Jesus, that's Hugh Hefner.
Oh, my God.
hoping for several hefty paydays
Yeah, I think it is. With Michael York.
that's gotta be Bunnies.
those are Bunnies? Those are real Bunnies?
frost and Nixon, Frost and Nixon
go together like Mason and Dixon
David, just putting it all together it's the most extraordinary accomplishment.
frost lines up with Dicky...
no one else could have done that.
and these interviews are always gonna be around for future generations of academics and political historians.
that bad?
he saved it
he wrote a book Now here's the hook
David!
Patrick.
he's not a crook .He's paid by David
my, what a festive atmosphere. Please, don't get up.
I take it from this that the interviews have gone well?
better than that, ma'am. It's a shutout.
the President's sitting on an 11-0 lead.
Really? Well. Yeah.
well, that is most gratifying.
I'm so glad it's all gone according to plan.
I see.
is there nothing we can do?
Really?
right. Well, thanks for letting me know.
it's true. They've dropped the Australian show.
Oh, no, David.
they felt that I needed to reevaluate my priorities.
now my producer's worried that the London show will follow.
I'm in this for everything I've got, and there's still no guarantee it'll ever see the light of day.
what have I done? What was I thinking? Why didn't anyone stop me?
they should have physically stopped me!
no, no, no. Shh.
look, we don't have to go out tonight. Why don't we stay in?
hmm?
I'll go down to Trader Vic's and bring something back.
steak or fish?
David?
don't worry. I'll call from the restaurant.
I'll have a cheeseburger.
Nixon. Mmm. That sounds good. I used to love cheeseburgers, but Dr. Lundgren made me give them up.
he switched me to cottage cheese and pineapple instead.
he calls them my Hawaiian burgers, but they don't taste like burgers at all.
they taste like Styrofoam.
I hope I'm not disturbing.
no.
it's a Friday night.
you've probably got somebody there whom you're entertaining.
no.
well, then what are you doing?
a handsome young fellow, an eligible young bachelor alone on a Friday night.
if you must know, I'm preparing for our final session.
the all-important final session.
Yes. Watergate.
cause I guess the way you handle Watergate's gonna determine whether these interviews are a success or a failure.
should I be nervous?
well, I'm gonna give it my best shot.
quite right. No holds barred. No holds barred.
you know, it's strange.
now, we have sat in chairs opposite one another, talking for hours, it seems, days on end, and yet I've hardly gotten to know you.
one of my people, as part of the preparation for this interview, she did a profile on you.
and I'm sorry to say that I just got around to reading it tonight.
there's some interesting stuff in there.
your Methodist background, the modest circumstances, and then you're off to a grand university full of richer, posher types.
what was it? Oxford?
Cambridge.
did the snobs there look down on you, too?
of course they did. That's our tragedy, isn't it, Mr. Frost?
no matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
I really don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
now, come on. No matter how many awards or column inches are written about you or how high the elected office is for me, it's still not enough.
we still feel like the little man, the loser they told us we were a hundred times.
the smart-asses at college, the high-ups, the well-born, the people whose respect we really wanted, really craved.
and isn't that why we work so hard now, why we fight for every inch, scrambling our way up in undignified fashion?
if we're honest for a minute, if we reflect privately just for a moment, if we allow ourselves a glimpse into that shadowy place we call our soul, isn't that why we're here now? The two of us?
looking for a way back into the sun, into the limelight, back onto the winner's podium.
because we could feel it slipping away.
we were headed, both of us, for the dirt!
a place the snobs always told us that we'd end up.
face in the dust.
humiliated all the more for having tried so pitifully hard.
well, to hell with that!
we're not gonna let that happen, either of us.
we're gonna show those bums.
we're gonna make them choke on our continued success, our continued headlines, our continued awards and power and glory!
we are gonna make those motherfuckers choke!
am I right?
you are. Except only one of us can win.
Yes.
and I shall be your fiercest adversary.
I shall come at you with everything I got, because the limelight can only shine on one of us.
and for the other, it'll be the wilderness, with nothing and no one for company but those voices ringing in our head.
you can probably tell I've had a drink.
it's not too many. Just one or two.
but you believe me, when the time comes, I'm gonna be focused and ready for battle.
good night, Mr. Frost.
good night,
Mr. President.
so with or without cheese? I brought burgers.
David?
I've got to work.
Nixon ON TAPE. Well, who was the asshole that did?
Jesus, is that Liddy?
he must be a little nuts.
Haldeman. Yeah, he is.
Nixon. I mean, he just isn't well screwed on, is he?
isn't that the problem?
Yeah, screw the Cabinet and the rest of those.
but no more sucking around. From now on, they come to me.
there is one thing that I want done, and I don't want any argument about it.
I want you to direct the most trusted person you have in the Immigration Service that they are to look over all the activities at the Los Angeles Times.
aII, underlined. And they are to send their teams in to see whether they are violating the wetback thing.
is that clear? MITCHELL. Yes, sir.
Nixon. You open that scab, there's a hell of a lot of things that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further.
Hello?
Jim, it's David.
Hey. What time is it?
how much longer are you gonna be in D. C. For?
Tuesday. Till Tuesday.
great. Well, you remember you mentioned going to the Federal Courthouse library?
honey, can you check on him, please?
Yes, for the Colson stuff?
well, I've been doing a little light reading this end, and you remember that hunch you had about the meeting between Nixon and Colson?
Uh-huh. What are you thinking?
Hey. Hey.
good morning.
And?
excuse me, sir.
it's 8: 30. Bob, have you seen David?
no. No Frost, no Reston.
morning. Good morning. Come on, let's go.
what's that about?
BIRT: First time he's late.
reporter: Mr. President!
morning.
Mr. President.
Mr. Frost.
davis: Thirty seconds to tape roll!
thirty seconds. Settling. Settle.
well, if today's session is anything like our phone call, it should be explosive.
what phone call?
the phone call to my hotel room.
davis: David, starting on camera three in four, three, two and...
now, looking back on your final year in office, do you feel you ever obstructed justice or were part of a conspiracy to cover up or obstruct justice?
no.
and I'm interested that you used the term "obstruction of justice."
now, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to the obstruction of justice.
as it happens, I have.
you have, you say? Well, then, you'll know it doesn't just require an act.
it requires a specific corrupt motive.
and in this case, I didn't have a corrupt motive.
what I was doing was in the interests of political containment.
be that as it may, the direct consequences of your actions would have been that two of the convicted burglars would have escaped criminal prosecution.
now, how can that not be a cover-up or obstruction of justice?
well, I think the record shows, Mr. Frost, that far from obstructing justice,
I was actively facilitating it.
when Pat Gray of the FBI telephoned me, this was July 6,
I said, "Pat, you go right ahead with your investigation."
that's hardly what you'd call obstructing justice.
well, that may be, but for two weeks prior to July 6, we now know that you were desperately trying to contain or block the investigation.
no, no. Hang on a minute there. I wasn't...
no, no. Obstruction of justice is obstruction of justice, whether it's for a minute or five minutes, and it's no defense to say that your plan failed.
I mean, if I try to rob a bank and fail, that's no defense.
I still tried to rob the bank.
will you just wait one minute there, Mr. Frost?
there is no evidence of any kind that I was...
well, the reason there is no evidence is because 18 and a half minutes of the conversation with Bob Haldeman from this June period have mysteriously been erased.
that was an unfortunate oversight.
and Bob Haldeman is a rigorous and a conscientious note taker.
his notes are there for all to see.
well, we found something rather better than his notes, a conversation with Charles Colson, which I don't think has ever been published.
okay, here we go.
it hasn't been published, you say?
no, but one of my researchers found it in Washington where it's available to anyone who consults the records.
well, I just wondered, you know, if we'd seen it.
more than seen it, Mr. President.
you spoke the actual words.
now, you've always claimed you first learned of the break-in on June 23.
Yeah.
but this transcript of a tape made three days earlier clearly shows that to be a falsehood.
now, in it you say to Colson, "This whole investigation rests "unless one of the seven begins to talk.
that's the problem.
well, what do we mean when we say "one of the seven beginning to talk"?
then moving on to a conversation you had with John Dean on March 21, the following year.
in one transcript alone, there in black and white,
I picked out, and these are your words, one, You could get $1 million, and you could get it in cash.
I know where it could be gotten.
two, Your major guy to keep under control is Hunt.
three, Don't we have to handle the Hunt situation?
four, Get the million bucks.
it would seem to me that would be worthwhile.
five, Don't you agree that you'd better get the Hunt thing going?
six, First you've got the Hunt problem.
that ought to be handled.Seven, The money can be provided.
Ehrlichman could provide the way to deliver it.
eight, We've no choice with Hunt "but the $120, 000 or whatever it is, right?
nine, Christ, turn over any cash we've got.
and I could go on. Now, it seems to me that someone running a cover-up couldn't have expressed it more clearly than that, could they?
look, let me just stop you now right there, because you're doing something here which I am not doing, and I will not do throughout these entire broadcasts.
you're quoting me out of context, out of order. And I might add,
I have participated in all these interviews without a single note in front of me.
well, it is your life, Mr. President.
now, you've always maintained that you knew nothing about any of this until March 21.
but in February, your personal lawyer came to Washington to start the raising of $219, 000 of hush money to be paid to the burglars.
now, do you seriously expect us to believe that you had no knowledge of that?
none. I believed the money was for humanitarian purposes.
to help disadvantaged people with their defenses.
well, it was being delivered on the tops of phone booths with aliases, and at airports by people with gloves on.
that's not normally the way lawyers' fees are delivered, is it?
look, I have made statements to this effect before.
all that was Haldeman and Ehrlichman's business.
I knew nothing. Okay, fine. Fine!
you made a conclusion there.
I stated my view, now let's move on.
let's get on to the rest of it.
no, hold on. No, hold on.
no, I don't want to talk...
if Haldeman and Ehrlichman were the ones really responsible, when you subsequently found out about it, why didn't you call the police and have them arrested?
isn't that just a cover-up of another kind?
Yeah, maybe I should have done that. Maybe I should have.
just called the feds into my office and said, "Hey, there's the two men."
haul them down to the dock, fingerprint them and then throw them in the can.
I'm not made that way.
these men, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, I knew their families.
I knew them since they were just kids.
Yeah, but you know, politically, the pressure on me to let them go, that became overwhelming!
so I did it. I cut off one arm, then I cut off the other, and I'm not a good butcher!
and I have always maintained what they were doing, what we were all doing, was not criminal.
look, when you're in office, you gotta do a lot of things sometimes that are not always, in the strictest sense of the law, legal, but you do them because they're in the greater interests of the nation!
right. Wait, just so I understand correctly, are you really saying that in certain situations, the President can decide whether it's in the best interests of the nation and then do something illegal?
I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal.
I'm sorry?
that's what I believe.
Oh, my God.
but I realize no one else shares that view.
so, in that case, will you accept, then, to clear the air once and for all, that you were part of a cover-up and that you did break the law?
Oh, my God, we got him. NIXON. I...
shit!
okay, let's take a break there.
what the fuck is going on?
cut it. Cut it.
excuse me? Shut it down.
shut it down now.
davis: That's not my call. You're gonna have to talk to the director.
he's in that truck out there. BRENNAN: Get him in here.
davis: Listen, we have an issue in here.
Jack, what are you doing? A break?
change the tapes.
David, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
what the hell is going on, Jack?
he was about to blow and you know it.
fellas, this is a critical moment in his life.
you realize we could sue you for this?
you have deliberately sabotaged the interview, Jack.
brennan: Look, we're all in this together.
I'm sure we can find a solution.
ZELNICK: A solution? What the hell are you talking about? It's an interview!
KHACHIGIAN: Bob, may I remind you...
BIRT: This is a breach of contract. We could sue.
for heaven's sake, Jim. Why don't you give him a week off?
give him a year off!
give him a fucking massage!
GANNON: Watch your language, for crying out loud.
What'd you do? Throw in the towel, Jack?
did you take pity on me?
sir, I just felt that if you were going to make some kind of emotional disclosure, that we should just take a moment to think it through, sketch it out.
I just want to impress upon you how crucially important this moment is and how many potentially devastating consequences unplanned emotional disclosures could have.
I know.
but to go on and carry on denying it all...
I appreciate the gesture.
we ought to call it a snafu.
Jack, are we on?
we're on. Okay, he's had plenty of time to cook up some sort of slippery new bullshit, so stay on your toes.
listen, it's gonna be fine. Pick up where you left off.
thirty seconds, everyone.
davis: Ten seconds.
David? Four, three, two, and...
Mr. President, we were talking about the period March 21 to April 30, and the mistakes you made, and so on, and I was wondering would you go further than "mistakes"?
the word that seems not enough for people to understand.
well, what word would you express?
my goodness.
all right.
since you've asked me, I think there are three things that people would like to hear you say.
one, that there was probably more than mistakes.
there was wrongdoing.
and, yes, it might have been a crime, too.
secondly, that I did abuse the power I had as President.
and thirdly, "I put the American people "through two years of needless agony, "and I apologize for that." And I know how difficult it is for anyone, especially you, but I think the people need to hear it.
and I think that unless you say it, you're going to be haunted for the rest of your life.
well, it's true. I made mistakes, horrendous ones, ones that were not worthy of a president, ones that did not meet the standards of excellence that I always dreamed of as a young boy.
but, if you remember, it was a difficult time.
I was caught up in a five-front war against a partisan media, a partisan House of Congress, a partisan Ervin Committee.
but, yes, I will admit there were times
I did not fully meet that responsibility and I was involved in a cover-up, as you call it.
and for all those mistakes I have a very deep regret.
no one can know what it's like to resign the presidency.
now, if you want me to get down on the floor and grovel...
No! Never!
I still insist they were mistakes of the heart.
they were not mistakes of the head.
but they were my mistakes. I don't blame anybody.
I brought myself down.
I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in, and they twisted it with relish.
and I guess if I'd been in their place, I'd have done the same thing.
and the American people?
I let them down.
I let down my friends.
I let down the country.
and worst of all,
I let down our system of government.
and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government, but now they think, "It's all too corrupt," and the rest.
Yeah.
I let the American people down, and I'm gonna have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life.
my political life is over.
you know, the first and greatest sin or deception of television is that it simplifies, it diminishes, great, complex ideas, tranches of time.
whole careers become reduced to a single snapshot.
at first, I couldn't understand whyBob Zelnick was quite as euphoric as he was after the interviews, or why John Birt felt moved to strip naked and rush into the ocean to celebrate.
but that was before I really understood the reductive power of the close-up.
because David had succeeded on that final day in getting, for a fleeting moment, what no investigative journalist, no state prosecutor, no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get.
richard Nixon's face, swollen and ravaged by Ioneliness, self-Ioathing and defeat.
the rest of the project and its failings would not only be forgotten, they would totally cease to exist.
reporter: Who came out on top, Mr. President?
is this what you call a dachshund?
Mmm-hmm.
very sweet.
the Nixon-Frost interviews were wildly successful.
I think they attracted the largest audience for a news program in the history of American television.
david was on the cover of Time magazine and Newsweek magazine.
and even the political press corps, the hard-bitten political press corps, called David up with messages of contrition and congratulation.
David, I want to say congratulations.
the interviews?
no, I didn't watch them. I couldn't.
Hey.
hello.
I believe David saw the former President just one more time.
before he left California for London again, he drove down to San Clemente to say goodbye.
Hey, Mr. Frost. It's nice to see you.
miss Cushing. Hello.
please excuse my golf outfit.
it's the official uniform of the retired.
are you on your way home?
Yes.
into a bright new dawn of fresh enterprises and challenges, eh?
well, let's hope so.
good for you.
I didn't catch the interviews as they went out, but they tell me that they were a great success.
I gather the journalists that were so positive about you weren't so kind to me.
Yes, I was sorry to see that.
there's no condolences necessary.
I've grown to expect nothing else from those sons of whores.
Yeah.
jeez, please forgive me, Miss Cushing.
you know, I would've said "sons of bitches,"
but Manolo here is a lover of dogs, and he hates me to defame animals.
can I get something for somebody?
Yes. Would you like some tea or champagne?
Hey, you know, we got that caviar the Shah of Iran sent me.
no, thank you. You sure?
come on. It'll be no trouble at all.
no, really, we must be...
okay, fine, fine. Thanks for coming by.
you were a worthy opponent.
goodbye, Mr. President.
Bye-bye.
goodbye, Mr. President.
goodbye.
Oh, God! I almost forgot. I...
I brought you a present, those shoes you admired.
I brought you a pair.
well, jeez. Thank you.
I'm touched. Safe trip, now.
Oh! Say, David, you think I could speak to you, privately, just for a minute?
do you know those parties of yours?
the ones that I read about in all the papers?
do you actually enjoy those?
of course.
you got no idea how fortunate that makes you.
you know? Liking people, and being liked.
having that facility, that lightness, that charm.
I don't have it. I never did.
it kind of makes you wonder why I chose a life that hinged on being liked.
I'm better suited to a life of thought, debate, intellectual discipline.
maybe we got it wrong.
maybe you should have been a politician and I the rigorous interviewer.
maybe.
David.
did I really call you that night?
Yes.
did we discuss anything important?
cheeseburgers.
cheeseburgers?
goodbye, sir.
Reston. Well, New York, London and Sydney welcomed David back with open arms, as did his friends and investors, who've made a fortune from these interviews.
he got back all of his shows.
he even got back his table at Sardi's.
as for Richard Nixon, well, he certainly never achieved the rehabilitation he so desperately craved.
his most lasting legacy is that today any political wrongdoing is immediately given the suffix "gate.
stop now.
tell me where it is.
you and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours.
I don't know what you are talking about.
is it a secret you will die for?
please. - As you wish.
wait!
my God, forgive me.
in the sacristy of the church of Saint-Sulpice, is the Rose Line.
beneath the Rose.
thank you.
thank you.
thank you.
symbols are a language that can help us understand our past.
as the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words...
...but which words?
interpret for me, please, this symbol. First thing that comes to mind.
hatred, racism. - Ku Klux Klan.
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would disagree with you in Spain.
there, they are robes worn by priests.
now this symbol. Anyone?
evil.
in English, please.
devil's pitchfork.
poor, poor Poseidon.
that is his trident. A symbol of power to millions of the ancients.
now this symbol.
Madonna and child. - Faith. Christianity.
no. No, it's the pagan god Horus and his mother Isis in the centuries before the brith of Christ.
understanding our past determines actively，our ability to understand the present.
so how do we sift truth from belief?
how do we write our own histories, personally or culturally...
...and thereby define ourselves?
how do we penetrate years, centuries, of historical distortion...
...to find original truth?
tonight, this will be our quest.
I still think that his whole take on phi was a little far-fetched.
I don't think so. I think that the golden ratio is everywhere in nature.
sure, I can do that.
my son is a student of yours at Harvard.
michael Culp? He adores you. - Oh, yeah.
he says you're the best teacher he's ever had.
ms. Culp, I think I already gave Michael an A-minus.
he told me. Thank you.
Mr. Langdon?
Hi.
Bonjour, professor.
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ. A kind of French FBI.
will you take a look at this photo, please?
my police chief, Capitaine Fache, had hoped...
...considering your expertise and the markings on the body...
...you might assist us.
will you excuse me a moment?
I was supposed to have drinks with him.
Yes, we know.
we found your name in his daily planner.
he never showed. I waited for over an hour.
why would someone do this to him?
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.
he was shot, yes.
but what you see in the photograph...
...Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.
teacher, all four are dead.
the senechaux and the Grand Master himself.
then I assume you have the location.
confirmed by all.
independently.
I had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail.
the prospect of death is strong motivation.
it is here.
in Paris, Teacher.
it hides beneath the rose in Saint-Sulpice.
you will go forth, Silas.
I chastise my body.
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.
okay.
Mr. Langdon. - Yes.
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.
you like our pyramid?
it's magnificent.
a scar on the face of Paris.
after me, please.
it's the pairing of those two pyramids.
it's unique.
the two are geometric echoes.
fascinating.
I'm not sure how much help I'm gonna be here this evening.
how well did you know the curator?
not at all. We met only once.
we were on a panel together.
something is funny?
we didn't agree on much.
frankly, I was surprised when he contacted me.
could we take the stairs?
so Sauniere requested tonight's meeting.
Yes.
how? Did he call you?
e-mail. He heard I was in Paris.
had something to discuss.
what?
you seem uncomfortable.
are any of those real? - Of course not.
so you know something of security procedures.
well, I know video surveillance in a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.
most now rely on containment.
Yes, forget about keeping the criminals out.
now we keep them in.
the Grand Gallery. This is where you found the body.
how would you know that?
I recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.
dear God.
let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence.
many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.
others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society.
we are a simple Catholic church. - Simple?
with a brand-new $47-million headquarters in Manhattan.
our followers are generous, should we apologize for that?
perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.
the press continue to be harsh with us.
we are not Cafeteria Catholics.
we don't pick and choose which rules to follow.
we follow doctrine. Rigorously.
does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing...
...and atonement for sins through self-flagellation and the cilice?
many of our followers are married. Many of them have families.
only a small proportion choose to live ascetically in the cloisters of our residential halls.
but we are all united in God's work around the world.
surely that is an admirable way to lead one's life.
why are some media referring to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?
obviously, some people fear what they don't understand.
and because the war finally draws to a close.
Bishop, we need to stay on message. - That will be all, Michael, thank you.
Aringarosa.
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.
it hides beneath the Rose.
my part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.
I meet the council in an hour.
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.
the Vitruvian Man.
it's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches.
and the star on his skin?
a pentacle.
and its meaning?
the pentacle is ancient.
symbols carry different meanings in different settings.
this symbol, professor. This setting.
the pentacle is a pagan religious icon.
devil worship.
no. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.
this is a symbol for Venus.
it represents the female half of all things.
it's a concept called "the divine goddess" by religious historians.
you are telling me that Sauniere's last act on earth was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest? Why?
captain Fache, obviously I can't tell you why.
I can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol...
...and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil.
is that so? - Yes.
then...
...what do you make of this?
o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint.
it's a phrase. Doesn't mean anything, not to me.
what would you do if you had such limited time to send a message?
well, I suppose I'd try to identify my killer.
precisely.
precisely.
so, professor...
officer Neveu.
please, pardon the interruption.
this is not the time.
I received the crime-scene jpegs at headquarters...
...and I've deciphered the code.
it's a Fibonacci sequence.
that's the code Sauniere left on the floor.
headquarters sent me to explain, captain.
it is the Fibonacci sequence.
the numbers are out of order.
but before that, I have an urgent message for Professor Langdon.
right?
pardon me?
I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.
your embassy called Division.
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death.
this is the number of your embassy's messaging service.
well, thank you.
Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu.
miss Neveu? This...
no. That's the right number.
you have to dial an access code to pick up your messages.
but I'm getting...
it's a three-digit code. It's on the paper I gave you.
professor Langdon, do not react to this message.
you must follow my directions very closely and, above all...
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.
you are in grave danger.
church of Saint-Sulpice.
good evening, Sister.
I need you to show someone our church tonight.
of course, Father.
but so late?
wouldn't tomorrow?
this is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei.
it would be my pleasure.
there's been an accident. A friend.
I have to fly home in the morning.
I see.
is there a restroom I could use? I just wanna splash some water on my face.
Yes.
she said it is meaningless.
mathematical joke.
is it meaningless?
I'll take another look when I come back.
I'm sorry. Of course.
do you have a message from Sauniere?
what are you talking about?
crazy old man.
you have me confused with someone else.
I was asked to come here and consult.
no, you are sous surveillance cachee.
Yes, and...
what?
bring the suspect to the crime scene and hope he incriminates himself.
suspect?
check your jacket pocket.
just look.
GPS tracking dot.
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.
the agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket...
...in case you tried to run.
we have you on a little leash, professor.
why would I try to run? I didn't do anything.
so, what do you think about the fourth line of text Fache wiped clean before you arrived?.
he brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon.
he's still in there? What's he doing?
Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay?
he is sure you're guilty.
when did Sauniere contact you?
today? - Yes, yes.
what time? What time?
at 3. Around 3. Three.
the gallery alarm was triggered at 8. You were...
I was giving a lecture. - At 9.
you had the privacy light on in your hotel room until 8: 30, right?
we call Fache "the Bull." Once he starts, he doesn't stop.
he can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case.
and by then whatever Sauniere wanted you to tell me will be useless.
stop it! Just stop!
who are you?
what are you talking about? Tell you what?
maybe who really killed him.
the Fibonacci sequence.
I believe Sauniere wrote it...
...so his investigation would include cryptographers.
that's quite a leap, isn't it?
no.
and the letters.
P. S. postscript.
princess Sophie." Yeah. Silly, I know.
but I was only a girl when I lived with him.
jacques Sauniere was my grandfather.
apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet.
if you help me understand why...
...I will get you to your embassy, where we cannot arrest you.
Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he?
no.
if we are to get away from here, we must find another way.
what exactly do you propose?
Sauniere was reading his book.
blood trail.
excuse me, captain.
crypto called. They identified the code.
Neveu told us already.
I should have fired her on the spot, barging in like that.
Yes.
except they didn't send Neveu.
what?
captain, look at this.
he jumped!
shit.
he's moving again. And fast.
he must be in a car.
he's going south on Pont du Carrousel.
bastard.
that cop will check the whole lower floor.
I will only take a moment.
of course.
he is much older than I remember.
I hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time.
he phoned my office today. Several times.
he said it was a matter of life and death.
I thought it was another trick to get back in touch.
it seems when he couldn't speak to me...
...he reached out to you.
whatever he needed so badly to say...
...he found neither of us in time.
wait a minute. - Professor?
come on.
it can't be that easy.
this is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.
the Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order.
these are scrambled.
if he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code.
would you hold this, please?
this phrase is meaningless.
unless you assume these letters are out of order too.
an anagram.
you have eidetic memory?
not quite. But I can pretty much remember what I see.
anagram is right.
o, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint" becomes:
Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa.
professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.
look at this. He must have thrown it from the window.
smart to hit the truck.
what, you admire him now?
we're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum?
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!
her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies.
the horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right.
Why?
well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right.
historically, the left was female, the right was male.
the sacred feminine.
why do you say that?
something Sauniere said the first time we came here.
there. Blood.
Hey.
so dark the con of man.
no. It doesn't say that.
is it another anagram? Can you break it?
professor, hurry. Hurry!
moon. Sermon. Charms.
demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks.
Madonna of the Rocks.
da Vinci.
careful. Careful.
this can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.
stay where you are!
let go of the painting...
...and put it on the ground.
no. You put your gun down.
now!
or else I will destroy the painting.
hurry up!
slide your gun to me.
be careful.
I never really liked this painting.
run.
it was Sauniere's.
I remember finding it once when I was a girl.
he'd promised he'd give it to me one day.
have you ever heard those words before, Sophie?
so dark the con of man?
no. Have you?
when you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings?
anything ritualistic in nature?
meetings your grandfather would've wanted kept secret?
was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion?
the what? Why are you asking these things?
the Priory of Sion is a myth.
one of the world's oldest and most secret societies, with leaders like...
...Sir Isaac Newton, da Vinci himself.
the fleur-de-lis is their crest.
they're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to...
...as "the dark con of man.
but what secret?
the Priory of Sion protects the source of God's power on earth.
I can't do this by myself.
I'm in enough trouble as it is. That's my embassy.
please.
even if we could get out of this...
okay.
no, no, no. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it!
well, that was...
we won't last long in this car.
Fache doesn't like to be eluded, even on a good day.
we need to get out of sight.
Christ, give me strength.
you are a ghost.
Christ, give me strength.
stealing in a house of God!
you are an angel.
Christ, give me strength.
you have powerful friends.
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.
I could not miss this chance to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.
a pity you couldn't wait for morning.
the light is not ideal.
tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.
a Rose Line is any line that goes from the North to South Poles.
set into the streets of Paris, 135 brass markers...
...mark the world's first prime meridian...
...which passed through this very church.
it hides beneath the Rose.
I'm sorry?
sister.
I do not want to keep you. I will show myself out.
I insist.
may the peace of the Lord be with you.
and with you.
gray Smart Car. Black roof.
corner of Denain Boulevard at the train station.
how could you let them get away?
why not just shoot the damn painting? Lmbecile!
you should put his cigar out in your hand!
get out of here!
they found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station.
and two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card.
a decoy, I'm sure.
all the same, send an officer to the station.
question all the taxi drivers. I'll put this on the wire.
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.
robert Langdon is guilty.
this is the Bois de Boulogne?
we should be safe in this park for a few minutes.
your police don't patrol this park.
stay here.
police.
what do you want?
fifty euros for all your stuff.
go and get something to eat.
did it occur to you that could be dangerous?
no. And now we have a place to think.
any ideas, professor?
you could've just handed me a piece of a UFO from Area 51.
what's the next step?
with him, it's always:
Sophie, what's the next step?
puzzles.
codes.
a treasure hunt.
to find his killer.
maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion.
I hope not.
any Priory story ends in bloodshed. They were butchered by the Church.
it all started over a thousand years ago when a French king conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.
this crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history...
...was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood...
...the Priory of Sion...
...and their military arm, the Knights Templar.
but the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.
that was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth.
supposedly the invasion was to find an artifact...
...lost since the time of Christ.
an artifact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess.
did they find it, this buried treasure?
put it this way:
one day the Templars simply stopped searching.
they quit the Holy Land and traveled directly to Rome.
whether they blackmailed the papacy...
...or the Church bought their silence, no one knows.
but it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights...
...these Knights Templar, of limitless power.
by the 1300s, the Templars had grown too powerful.
too threatening.
so the Vatican issued secret orders to be opened simultaneously all across Europe.
the Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers...
...and said God had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics.
the plan went off like clockwork.
the Templars were all but exterminated.
the date was October 13th, 1307. A Friday.
friday the 13th.
the Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure...
...but they found nothing.
the few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished...
...and the search for their sacred artifact began again.
what artifact? I've never heard about any of this.
Yes, you have.
almost everyone on earth has.
you just know it as the Holy Grail.
please, Sauniere thought he knew the location of the Holy Grail?
maybe more than that.
this cross and the flower, this could be very old. But look.
this metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.
Haxo 24.
and these dots. These dots are read by a laser.
this is more than a pendant. This is a key your grandfather left you.
he left us, professor.
and vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an ID stamp.
it's a street address.
this is Jacques Sauniere.
please leave a message after the tone.
please, Monsieur Sauniere, pick up the phone.
this is Sandrine Bieil.
I have called the list.
I fear the other guardians are dead.
the lie has been told.
the floor panel has been broken.
please, monsieur, pick up the phone. I beg you.
job 38, verse 11.
do you know it, Sister?
job 38: 11.
hitherto shalt thou come...
...but no further.
but no further.
do you mock me?
where is the keystone?
I do not know.
no.
you are a sister of the Church...
...and yet you serve them: The Priory.
Jesus had but one true message. That...
come, you saints of God.
hasten, angels of the Lord.
to receive her soul.
and bring her to the sight of the Almighty.
in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
welcome, bishop.
may Christ be with you.
and also with you.
it's been too long, Manuel.
I saw your press conference.
very priestly.
vultures.
but you need a good cover to fly into Italy these days.
so how are things in Rome?
we serve at his pleasure.
today is today.
but there are many tomorrows.
Vatican cellars.
Seventy-six, a year of independence. How fitting.
I thought you'd like it.
I'll fetch the others.
welcome, bishop.
this council is convened.
our words shall never pass these walls.
what business, say you?
as you know, my request for funds...
Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds.
a tad more than petty cash. Wouldn't you say, bishop?
the endeavor is complex. Freedom has a high cost.
and, of course, you will deliver us.
how fortunate we are.
I only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men.
how humble.
our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.
were we to grant your request...
...when would this mission commence?
actually, tonight. - What?
it has begun. - We have not agreed.
how dare you presume to...
I do not presume, I act!
the Vatican's unwillingness to support us...
...is both impious and cowardly.
blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins. No more!
this council has forgotten its very purpose.
tonight...
...the Grail will be destroyed.
the Priory's few remaining members will be silenced.
I was contacted by a man who calls himself only "the Teacher.
he knows a great deal about this council.
and about the Priory.
two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu...
...getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne.
because of your expertise?
I'm sorry? - About the Priory.
do you think that's why Sauniere sought you out?
I can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it.
actually, I didn't think he liked me very much.
once made a joke at my expense. Got a big laugh out of it.
what was it?
how may I help you?
the door to the right, please.
that was quite a performance.
the little shit should know better than to play politics with me.
I know I got in front of you, old friend.
I did what I thought was best.
so...
...now what?
now we wait for the Teacher's call.
good evening. I am Andre Vernet, the night manager.
I take it this is your first visit to our establishment?
Yes.
understood.
keys are often passed on and first-time users are sometimes uncertain of protocol.
keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.
often willed through generations.
is it yours, mademoiselle?
the shortest safety-deposit-box lease is 50 years.
and what's your longest account?
quite a bit longer.
technologies change, keys are updated.
but our accounts date back to the beginning of banking itself.
once the computer confirms your key...
...enter your account number and your box is retrieved.
the room is yours, as long as you like.
what if I lost track of my account number?
how might I recover it?
I'm afraid each key is paired with a 10-digit number...
...known only to the account bearer.
I hope you manage to remember it.
a single wrong entry disables the system.
ten. - Ten.
your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.
scrambled, unscrambled?
unscrambled.
it's your key.
funny, I don't even like history.
I've never seen much good come from looking to the past.
moment of truth.
my God. I don't believe this.
a rose.
the rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.
forgive the intrusion.
I'm afraid the police arrived more quickly than I anticipated.
you must follow me, please.
for your own safety.
you knew they were coming?
my guard alerted me to your status when you arrived.
yours is one of our oldest and highest-level accounts.
it includes a safe-passage clause.
safe passage?
if you would step inside, please. Time is of the essence.
in there?
Hey, is there a problem?
good evening, sir. Police.
I just drive from here to Zurich. Not French, English?
English? - Yes.
we are looking for two criminals.
you came to the right place. They're all criminals here.
would you mind opening the hold?
please. You think they trust us, the wages I get paid?
you don't have keys to your own truck?
it's armored. Keys get sent to the destination.
you mind? I'm on a schedule here.
and do all the drivers wear a Rolex?
what?
this piece of shit.
forty euros in Barbes.
yours for 35.
no, no, no.
thirty. - No. It's okay, it's okay.
come on, 30, eh?
I said, no!
move along!
now we wait.
the Teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money.
you have put tremendous faith in this Teacher of yours.
Yes, I have. And I have given him an angel to do his will.
for surely there is no better soldier for God than my Silas.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins to do penance and to amend my life.
Amen.
I chastise my body.
the Holy Grail.
a magic cup. The source of God's power on earth.
it's nonsense.
you don't believe in God.
no.
I don't believe in some magic from the sky.
just people.
sometimes that they can be kind.
and that's enough?
well, I think it has to be. I think it's all we have.
are you a God-fearing man, professor?
I was raised a Catholic.
well, that's not really an answer.
professor, are you okay?
go ahead, open it.
go on.
a cryptex.
they are used to keep secrets.
it's da Vinci's design.
you write the information on a papyrus scroll...
...which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar.
if you force it open, the vial breaks...
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...
...and your secret is lost forever.
the only way to access the information...
...is to spell out the password...
...with these five dials, each with 26 letters.
that's 12 million possibilities.
I've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex.
Sauniere made one for me once.
my grandfather gave me a wagon.
this clearly is not the Holy Grail.
come on.
please, you're not all right.
may I try something?
I don't know why it works.
my mother used to do it when I was scared, I think.
you think?
Yes.
feeling better, Sophie?
my parents died in a car crash with my brother.
I was 4.
I'm sorry.
it was many years ago.
better?
Yeah.
okay.
twenty years waiting for someone to come for that box...
...and now it's you two murderers. Bring it to me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
all right! Okay!
right now!
step back!
no one will lose sleep over a couple on a killing spree.
turn around.
turn around!
you too, mademoiselle.
Sophie!
get in the truck!
I'll drive! Hurry!
better? - Always, if I got too nervous...
...I had to put my head out of the window not to be sick.
Sauniere used to say I was like a dog.
a cute dog. You know, a little dog.
what happened between you and your grandfather, Sophie?
I've jammed my shoulder, I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.
I need to know.
you say he raised you, but you two don't talk anymore.
you call him by his last name.
you say you hate history.
nobody hates history. They hate their own histories.
so now you're a psychologist too?
what if Sauniere had started to groom you for the Priory?
what do you mean, groom me?
your grandfather gave you puzzles and cryptex as a child.
say Sauniere was hoping one day you would join him in the Priory.
still, years later, when he imagines...
...the Grail is in danger, he reaches out to you.
so you are saying all this is real? The Priory, the Holy Grail?
we've been dragged into a world of people who think this stuff is real.
real enough to kill for. - Who?
I'm out of my field here.
I do know a Grail historian, absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.
an Englishman, lives here in France.
do you trust this man?
I hope you can.
Vernet, Andre.
it seems you're not a driver at all.
apparently, you lost your tongue along with your truck.
aiding and abetting two murder suspects.
that carries jail time.
speak to my lawyer.
all this confusion, violence, vanishing property...
it might get around that your bank is less than ideal, don't you think?
you think you're in pain now, Andre Vernet?
my cause is worth your life. Understand?
what do you want?
your truck carries a homing device. Activate it.
please wait. I'll see if he's available.
it's on the wrong side.
Leigh likes all things to be English, including his cars.
Robert! Do I owe you money?
Leigh, my friend...
...care to open up for an old colleague?
of course. - Thank you.
but first, a test of honor.
three questions.
fire away.
your first:
shall I serve coffee or tea?
tea, of course.
excellent.
second: Milk or lemon?
milk?
that would depend on the tea.
correct.
and now the third and most grave of inquiries:
in which year did a Harvard sculler outrow an Oxford man at Henley?
surely such a travesty has never occurred.
your heart is true.
you may pass.
welcome to Chateau Villette.
Leigh Teabing has spent his entire life...
...studying the Grail. That thing is one hot tamale.
sorry?
the cryptex, it's a hot coal.
a hot potato?
so you want to keep our chest close to our cards, yes?
very close.
the truck's signal is coming online.
it's about time.
locked on and tracking, sir.
very good. Tell Collet not to move in until I get there.
attention! All of Collet's units to Chateau Villette.
the suspects Neveu and Langdon are likely at that location.
Aringarosa.
I still don't know why he put you into this...
...and I'm sorry.
but...
...l'm also very glad.
you are requested to make yourself at home.
Robert!
and you travel with a maiden, it seems.
sir Leigh Teabing, may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.
it's an honor to welcome you even though it's late.
thank you for having us. I realize it's quite late.
so late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.
what a lovely smile you have.
Earl Grey?
lemon.
correct.
Chateau Villette. Yes.
no. - Oh, you must.
Remy is from Lyons, but nevertheless...
...he is fantastic with sauces.
thank you. - No, I can't.
a dramatic late-night arrival.
mention of life and death.
what can an old cripple do for you, Robert?
we wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.
the keepers?
the secret war?
sorry for all the mystery.
Leigh, I'm into something here that I cannot understand.
you?
Really? - Not without your help.
playing to my vanity, Robert. You should be ashamed.
not if it works.
there are always four:
the Grand Master and the three senechaux...
...make up the primary guardians of the Grail.
thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now.
the Priory's members span our very globe itself.
philippe de Cherisey exposed that as a hoax in 1967.
and that is what they want you to believe.
the Priory is charged with a single task:
to protect the greatest secret in modern history.
the source of God's power on earth.
no, that's a common misunderstanding.
the Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth:
the Holy Grail.
I don't understand.
what power? Some magic dishes?
Robert. Has he been telling you that the Holy Grail is a cup?
to understand the Holy Grail, my dear...
...you must first understand the Holy Bible.
the Good Book did not arrive by facsimile from heaven.
the Bible as we know it was finally presided over by one man:
the pagan emperor Constantine.
I thought Constantine was a Christian.
Oh, hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan...
...who was baptized on his deathbed.
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.
from time immemorial...
...his people had worshiped a balance between nature's male deities and the goddess, or scared feminine.
but a growing religious turmoil was gripping Rome.
three centuries earlier...
...a young Jew named Jesus had come along...
...preaching love and a single God.
centuries after his crucifixion...
...Christ's followers had grown exponentially...
...and had started a religious war against the pagans.
or did the pagans commence war against the Christians?
Leigh, we can't be sure who began the atrocities in that period.
we can at least agree that the conflict grew to such proportions...
...that it threatened to tear Rome in two.
so Constantine may have been a lifelong pagan...
...but he was also a pragmatist.
and in 325 anno Domini...
...he decided to unify Rome under a single religion, Christianity.
christianity was on the rise. He didn't want his empire torn apart.
and to strengthen this new Christian tradition...
...Constantine held a famous ecumenical gathering...
...known as the Council of Nicaea.
and at this council...
...the many sects of Christianity debated and voted on, well...
...everything, from the acceptance and rejection of specific gospels...
...to the date for Easter...
...to the administering of the sacraments, and of course...
...the immortality of Jesus.
I don't follow.
well, ma chere, until that moment in history...
...Jesus was viewed by many of his followers as a mighty prophet...
...as a great and powerful man, but a man nevertheless.
a mortal man.
some Christians held that Jesus was mortal.
some Christians believed he was divine.
not the Son of God?
not even his nephew twice removed.
hold on, you're saying Jesus' divinity came from a vote.
well, remember, in those days, gods were everywhere.
by infusing Jesus the man with the divine magic...
...By making him capable of earthly miracles...
...as well as his own resurrection, Constantine turned him into a god...
...but within the human world.
and he basically knocked the more distant gods out of the game.
Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity.
he simply sanctioned an already widely held idea.
semantics. - No, it's not semantics.
you're interpreting facts to support your own conclusions.
fact: For many Christians, Jesus was mortal one day and divine the next.
for some Christians, his divinity was enhanced.
absurd. There was a formal announcement of his promotion.
they couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed!
excuse me. "Who is God, who is man?
how many have been murdered over this question?
as long as there has been a one true God...
...there has been killing in his name.
now let me show you the Grail.
this used to be the ballroom.
I have little occasion to dance these days.
I trust you recognize The Last Supper...
...the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.
now, my dear, if you would close your eyes.
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.
you asked for my help, I recall.
allow an old man his indulgences.
now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting?
in the middle. - Good.
he and his disciples are breaking bread.
and what drink?
wine. They drank wine.
splendid. And one final question:
how many wineglasses are there on the table?
one? The Holy Grail?
open your eyes.
no single cup.
no chalice.
well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?
considering both the Bible and standard Grail legend...
...celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.
now, Robert, you could be of help to us.
if you'd be so kind as to show us the symbols for man and woman, please.
no balloon animals. I can make a great duck.
this is the original icon for male. It's a rudimentary phallus.
quite to the point. - Yes, indeed.
this is known as the blade.
it represents aggression and manhood.
it's a symbol still used today in modern military uniforms.
Yes, the more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.
now, as you would imagine, the female symbol is its exact opposite.
this is called the chalice.
and the chalice resembles a cup or vessel or, more importantly...
...the shape of a woman's womb.
no, the Grail has never been a cup.
it is quite literally this ancient symbol of womanhood.
and in this case, a woman who carried a secret so powerful...
...that if revealed, it would devastate the very foundations of Christianity.
wait, please.
you're saying the Holy Grail is a person? A woman?
and it turns out, she makes an appearance right there.
but they are all men.
are they?
what about that figure on the right hand of our Lord...
flowing red hair.
folded feminine hands.
hint of a bosom. No?
it's called scotoma. The mind sees what it chooses to see.
who is she?
my dear, that's Mary Magdalene.
the prostitute?
she was no such thing.
smeared by the Church in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.
this is an old wives' tale.
the original one, in fact.
there's virtually no empirical proof.
he knows as well as I do there's much evidence to support it.
theories. There are theories.
notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.
mirror images of each other.
the mind sees what it chooses to see.
and venturing into the even more bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...
...appear to be joined at the hip and are leaning away from each other...
...as if to create a shape in the negative space between them.
Leonardo gives us the chalice.
Yes. Oh, and Robert, notice what happens...
...when these two figures change position.
just because da Vinci painted it doesn't make it true.
no. But history...
...she does make it true.
now, listen to this. It's from the Gospel according to Philip.
Philip?
Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea...
...along with any other gospels that made...
...Jesus appear human and not divine.
and the companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene.
christ loved her more than all the disciples...
...and used to kiss her on the...
but this says nothing of marriage.
well, actually...
Robert.
actually, in those days, the word "companion" literally meant "spouse.
and this is from the Gospel of Mary Magdalene herself.
she wrote a gospel? - She may have.
Robert, will you fight fair? - She may have.
and Peter said, "Did he prefer her to us? "
and Levi answered:
"Peter, I see you contending against a woman like an adversary.
if the Savior made her worthy, who are you, indeed, to reject her?"
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...
...that it's up to her to continue his Church.
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.
the Church was supposed to be carried on by a woman.
few realize that Mary was descended from kings, just as her husband was.
now, my dear, the word in French for Holy Grail.
from the Middle English "Sangreal..."
...of the original Arthurian legend.
now, as two words. Can you translate for our friend?
sang real, it means "royal blood.
when the legend speaks of the chalice that held the blood of Christ...
...it speaks in fact of the female womb that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.
but how could Christ have a bloodline, unless...?
Mary was pregnant at the time of the Crucifixion.
for her own safety and for that of Christ's unborn child...
...she fled the Holy Land and came to France.
and here, it is said, she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.
they know the child's name.
a little girl. - Yes.
if that were true, it's adding insult to injury.
Why?
the pagans found transcendence through the joining of male to female.
people found God through sex?
in paganism, women were worshiped as a route to heaven...
...but the modern Church has a monopoly on that...
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.
and he who keeps the keys to heaven rules the world.
women, then, are a huge threat to the Church.
the Lord of The Rings
Smeagol, I've got one!
I've got a fish, Sme.Smeagol
go on! Go on, pull it in!
Deagol?
Deagol
Deagol
give us that, Deagol my love.
Why?
because...
it's my birthday and I want it.
they cursed us "Murderer
they cursed us and drove us away.
Gollum...
and we wept, Precious.
we wept to be so alone.
so juicy, sweet
and we forgot the taste of bread...
the sound of trees.
the softness of the wind.
we even forgot our own name.
my Precious.
wake up!
wake up!
wake up sleepies!
we must go, yes
we must go at once.
haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?
I've gone and had too much.
it must be getting late.
no, it isn't.
it isn't midday yet.
the days are growing darker.
come on!
must go, no time!
not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.
no time to lose, silly!
here.
what about you?
ah no, I am not hungry.
least ways not for lembas bread.
Sam...
all right, we don't have that much left.
we have to be careful, or we're going to run out.
you go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.
I've rationed it.
there should be enough.
for what?
the journey home.
come, Hobbitses.
we are close now
very close to Mordor.
no safe places here.
Hurry!
the RETURN OF THE KING
I feel like I am back at the Green Dragon after a hard day's work.
only, you've never done a hard day's work.
welcome, my Lord
to Isengard
you, young rascals.
a merry hunt you've led us on and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!
we are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
the salted pork is particulary good.
salted pork.
Hobbits. - We are under the orders! From Treebeard...
who's taken over management of Isengard.
young Master Gandalf. I'm glad you've come.
wood and water, stock and stone, I can master.
but there is a wizard to manage here; Look to his tower
and there Saruman must remain, Under your guard, Treebeard.
well, let's just have his head and be done with it.
no
he has no power anymore.
the filth of Saruman is washing away.
the trees will came back to live here.
young trees, wild trees.
Pippin
bless my bark!
Peregrin Took! Now I will take that, my lad.
quickly now.
tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.
hail the victorious dead!
hail
Westu Aragorn hal.
I'm happy for you, he is an honorable man.
you are both honorable men.
it was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
Ah, don't listen to me.
you are young.
and tonight is for you.
Oh you can search far and wide, You can drink the whole town dry,
but you'll never find a beer so brown, As the one we drink in our hometown.
you can keep your fancy ales, You can drink them by the flagon,
but the only brew for the brave and true,
comes from the Green Dragon!
thank you!
no news of Frodo?
no word. Nothing.
every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
do we know that?
what does your heart tell you?
Yes.
Yes, he is alive.
too risky.
too risky.
thieves. They stole it from us.
kill them!
kill them!
kill them both!
Shhh, Quiet. Musn't wake them.
musn't ruin it now.
but they knows,
they knows.
they suspects us.
what's it saying, my precious, my love?
Smeagol losing his nerve?
No! Not! Never!
Smeagol hates nasty hobbitses.
Smeagol wants to see them...dead!
and we will.
Smeagol did it once.
it's ours!
ours!
we must get the precious.
we must get it back.
patience. Patience my love.
first we must lead them to her.
we lead them to the winding stairs.
Yes, the stairs and then?
up, up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to... the tunnel.
and when they go in, there's no coming out.
she is always hungry.
she always needs to feed.
she must eat.
all she gets is filthy orcses.
and they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?
no
not very nice at all, my love.
she hungers for sweeter meats.
Hobbit-meat
and when she throws away the bones and empty clothes, then we will find it.
and take it for me!
for us.
Yes, we meant, we meant for us.
gollum, Gollum.
the precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead.
you treacherous little!
no, no! Master!
no, Sam! Leave him alone!
I heard it from his own mouth, he means to murder us!
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
Aaaah! He's a horrid, fat hobbit who hates Smeagol and makes up nasty lies!
you miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
Sam!
don't call me a liar! You're a liar!
you'll scare him off, we're lost! - I don't care!
I can't do it, Mr. Frodo. I won't wait around for him to kill us
I'm not sending him away.
you don't see it, do you? He's a villain
we can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
not without a guide.
I need you on my side.
I am on your side, Mr. Frodo.
I know, Sam.
I know.
trust me.
come, Smeagol.
the stars are veiled.
something stirs in the East.
the Eye of the enemy is moving.
what you are doing?
Pippin.
Pippin.
Pippin.
are you mad? - I just want to look at it.
just one more time.
put it back.
Pippin.
no
Pippin
he is here!
I see you!
Pippin
help! Gandalf
help him!! Someone help him!
Pippin
fool of a Took!
look at me!
Gandalf.
forgive me!
look at me
what did you see?
a tree
it was a white tree.
in a courtyard of stone
the City was burning.
Minas Tirith.
is that what you saw?
I saw...
I saw Him!
I can hear His voice in my head.
and what did you tell him?
speak!
he asked me my name. I didn't answer.
he hurt me.
what did you tell Him about Frodo and the Ring?
there was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
a fool.
but an honest fool he remains.
he told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
we've been strangely fortunate.
Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan.
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
his defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing:
he knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
men are not as weak as He supposed;
there is courage still. Strength enough perhaps to challenge Him.
Sauron fears this.
he will not risk the peoples of Middle-Earth uniting under one banner.
he will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a King return to the throne of men.
if the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
what do we owe Gondor?
I will go.
no.
they must be warned.
they will be.
you must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
follow the river and look to the black ships.
understand this:
things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
I ride for Minas Tirith and I won't be going alone.
of all the inquisitive hobbits. Peregrin Took, you are the worst!
Hurry! Hurry!
where are we going?
why did you look? Why do you always have to look?
I don't know. I can't help it.
you never can.
I'm sorry, all right?
I won't do it again.
don't you understand?
the enemy thinks that you have the Ring.
he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
and you -- you're coming with me?
merry?
come on!
how far is Minas Tirith?
three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.
and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
here, something for the road.
the last of the Longbottom Leaf?
I know you've run out
you smoke too much, Pippin.
but, we'll see each other soon.
won't we?
I don't know.
I don't know what's going to happen.
merry
run, Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste.
merry
merry
take her by the safest road.
a ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
it waits to carry her across the sea.
the last journey of Arwen Undomiel.
lady Arwen.
we cannot delay.
my lady
tell me what you have seen.
Arwen
you have the gift of foresight. What did you see?
I looked into your future and I saw death.
you saw there was a child.
you saw my son.
that future is almost gone.
but it is not lost.
nothing is certain
some things are certain.
if I leave him now.
I will regret it forever.
from the ashes a fire shall be woken.
renewed shall be blade that was broken.
the crownless again shall be King.
reforge the sword.
atar
your hands are cold.
this was my choice.
Atar, whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
we've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
Minas Tirith
city of Kings
make way!
it's the tree.
Gandalf! - Yes.
it's the white tree of Gondor The tree of the King.
lord Denethor, however, is not the king.
he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
now, listen carefully.
lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
to give him news of his beloved son's death will be most unwise
and do not mention Frodo, or the Ring.
and say nothing of Aragorn either.
in fact, it's better if you do not speak at all, Peregrin Took.
hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.
I come with tidings in this dark hour. And with counsel.
perhaps you come to explain this.
perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
Boromir died to save us, my kinsman and me.
he fell defending us from many foes. - Pippin
I offer you my service, such as it is.
in payment of this debt.
get up!
my Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir.
but it is not now.
war is coming.
the enemy is on your doorstep.
as steward you're charged with the defence of the city.
where are Gondor's armies?
you are not alone in this fight.
send word to Theoden of Rohan.
you think you are wise, Mithrandir.
yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
I have seen more than you know.
with your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.
and with your right, you would seek to supplant me.
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.
Oh, yes!
word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, Steward!
the rule of Gondor is mine!
and no other's!
come
so I imagine this is just a ceremonial position
I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting, do they?
you're in the service of the Steward now
you're going to have to do as you're told.
it's so quiet.
it's the deep breath before the plunge.
I don't want to be in a battle.
but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.
is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
there never was much hope.
just a fool's hope.
our enemy is ready.
not only Orcs but men as well,
legions of Haradrim from the South.
mercenaries from the coast.
all will answer Mordor's Call.
this will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
here the hammer-stroke will fall the hardest.
if the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.
but we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
Gandalf?
Sauron has yet to release his deadliest servant.
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.
the one they say no living man can kill.
he stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
he is Lord of the Nazgul.
the Dead City.
very nasty place full of enemies
quick! Quick!
they will see. They will see.
come away! Come away!
look!
we've found it.
the way into Mordor.
the secret stair
climb!
no, Mr. Frodo!
not that way!
Ah! What's he doing?! - No!
they are calling me.
No!
hide! Hide!
I can feel his blade. Oh!
we come to it at last.
the great battle of our time.
come away, Hobbits!
we climb, we must climb.
the board is set.
the pieces are moving.
Peregrin Took, my lad. There is a task now to be done.
another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
you must not fail me.
quiet.
to the river! Quick!
come on!
faster!
draw swords!
amon Din.
the Beacon. The Beacon of Amon Din is lit!
hope is kindled.
the beacons of Minas Tirith!
the beacons are lit!
assemble the army at Dunharrow, as many men as can be found.
you have two days.
on the third we ride for Gondor, and war.
March!
Gamling. - Sir.
make haste across the Riddermark.
summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow. - I will.
you ride with us? - Just to the encampment.
it's tradition for the women of the Court to farewell the men.
the men have found their captain.
they will follow you into battle, even to death.
you have given us hope.
so it is before the walls of Minas Tirith, the doom of our time will be decided.
now is the hour.
riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.
now, fulfil them all!
Faramir
we can't hold them!
the City is lost.
tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.
Nazgul!
take cover!
fall back!
fall back to Minas Tirith!
retreat! Retreat!
the age of men is over.
the time of the Orc has come.
let's ride to a safe place
protect our lord
Mithrandir!
they broke through our defenses.
they've taken the bridge and the west bank.
battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
it is as the Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom!
foreseen and done nothing!
Faramir?
this is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path?
no.
you've seen Frodo and Sam?
where? When?
in Ithilien, not two days ago.
Gandalf, they've taken the road to the Morgul Vale.
and then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
what does that mean?
what's wrong?
careful master! Careful!
very far to fall.
very dangerous on the stairs.
come, master!
come to Smeagol.
Mr. Frodo!
get back, you!
don't touch him!
why does he hates poor Smeagol?
what has Smeagol ever done to him?
master?
master carries a heavy burden.
Smeagol knows.
heavy, heavy burden.
the fat one cannot know.
Smeagol will look after master.
he needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eyes.
very soon he will ask you for it.
you will see.
the fat one will take it from you!
send forth all legions.
what of the wizard?
I will break him.
what of Theoden's Riders?
will Rohan's army come?
Mithrandir?
in peace or war.
in living or dying
from...
from this hour henceforth,
until my Lord release me,
or death take me.
and I shall not forget it.
nor fail to reward that which is given.
fealty with love.
disloyalty with vengeance.
I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences.
defences that your brother long held intact.
what would you have me do?
I will not yield the river and Pelennor unfought.
Osgiliath must be re-taken.
my lord, Osgiliath is over-run.
much must be risked in war.
is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?
you wish now that our places had been exchanged.
that I had died and Boromir had lived.
Yes.
I wish that.
since you're robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead.
what are you up to?
sneakin' off, are we?
sneaking?
sneaking!
fat hobbit is always so polite.
Smeagol shows them secret ways... that nobody else can find,
and they say sneak!
sneak!
very nice friend, oh yes, my precious, very nice.
alright! Alright!
you just startled me, that's all.
what were you doing?
sneaking.
fine. Have it your own way.
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.
we have to be moving on.
it's dark still!
it's always dark here.
it's gone!
the Elven bread!
what?
that's all we have left!
he took it.
he must have!
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.
Smeagol hates nasty elf-bread.
you are a lying wretch! What did you do with it?
he doesn't eat it.
he can't have taken it!
look. What is this?
crumbs on his jacketses!
he took it!
he took it!
I've seen him! He's always stuffing his face when Master's not looking.
that's a filthy lie! You stinkin' two-faced sneak!
Sam!
stop it!
Sam!
I'll kill him!
Sam, no!
Oh my, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it to go so far!
I was just so, so angry.
here, just... let's just rest a bit.
I'm alright.
no, you're not alright.
you're exhausted.
it's that Gollum
it's this place
it's that thing around your neck
I could help a bit.
I could carry it for a while.
carry it for a while...
I could carry it.
share the load.
get away!
I don't want to keep it!
I just want to help.
see? See?
he wants it for himself.
go away!
get out of here!
it's you.
but he is a liar!
he's poisoned you against me.
you can't help me anymore.
you don't mean that!
go home!
Mary didn't even kiss Joseph and look what happened.
Oh, Lord, what have I done?
can I talk to you? Sure.
well?
Hello? Is there anybody there?
just give me a second. I'm trying.
I want to tell you.
I may be pregnant with the next Jewish-Italian messiah.
nothing.
what is the matter with you?
what is happening in your brain when you just sit there, not moving, not speaking?
what? What?
dad, you're the only one who can help and you're never here.
where are you?
Joe doesn't know where she is.
she's angry. That's okay. Blowing off steam, that's okay.
taking my car is not okay.
that's going too far.
did she say that anything was bothering her?
I'm her mother.
if something bothers her, I'm the last person she'll tell.
she's a teenager. I'm amazed she talks at all.
where is she?
onward Christian soldiers
I want to lead a violent and exciting life!
excuse me. I seem to be having engine trouble.
who is it? It's just a young girl.
I'm a shepherd who's lost my flock.
your folks know where you are?
they know exactly where I am.
