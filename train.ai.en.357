Hsin-hung chen testified that, although the former idol drama actor, but because red is not up and unstable income, and only desperation.
hsin-mei also thought this sort of crying was something that should be kept from strangers and did not dare question her closely about it.
hsin-mei and hung-chien consoled him for a while and urged him to go back to his room and get some sleep. The next day he could go to kao sung-nien and speak his piece.
hsin-mei and hung-chien had not only become quite used to hearing this sort of talk lately; they had even gotten in the habit of saying it themselves.
hsin-mei and hung-chien quickly stood up and took a close look at the two small landscape paintings.
hsin-mei and ku urged miss sun not to get upset, "men like that never have anything nice to say."
hsin-mei and li returned more than an hour later.
hsin-mei asked who it was. Fully expecting her to say it was him, hung-chien forced himself to remain composed.
hsin-mei came in as though drunk, his face flushed a bright red and staggering on his feet. Without waiting for hung-chien to speak, he said, "hung-chien, I'm leaving this school at once. I can't stay here any longer."
hsin-mei felt the question was naive beyond a doubt.
hsin-mei fined him another half glass of wine, while miss su warned him not to talk so much.
hsin-mei gave miss su a happy wink; she suddenly looked very dumb, appearing to see nothing.
hsin-mei gave the bottle to shen-ming. "You pour your own. I won't stand on ceremony with you."
hsin-mei gave the dozen or so gooks he had brought with him to hung-chien, saying, "later on if you find you can't take these with you, donate them to the library for me."
hsin-mei kicked hung-chien under the table, while he babbled on about something else. In the end li and fang did not start a quarrel, and miss sun's bulging eyes returned to their normal state.
hsin-mei laughed at him for getting so downhearted and said, "if you can't take a blow any better than that, you'll never have a successful love affair."
hsin-mei laughed loudly and asked, "what did you two come to this godforsaken place to talk about so early in the morning?"
hsin-mei let out an exclamation and closed the cover to see who the author was. "Do you know this guy?" He asked hung-chien.
hsin-mei quickly offered him his place as the seat of honor, so he was no longer sitting next to miss fan.
hsin-mei replied that a friend of his in chungking had written several times asking him to go there. He would stay at a hotel in town for the night and set off early the next morning.
hsin-mei replied that he would ask the china travel agency to take care of the tickets.
hsin-mei replied that there were only his mother, himself, and three servants, while his brother and sister-in-law lived in tientsin.
hsin-mei said hesitantly, "it sounds very good, but what about the money the school wired to chian?"
hsin-mei said mischievously to hung-chien, "keep miss sun good company." Hung-chien found himself momentarily at a loss for words.
hsin-mei said that kao knew all about it and was planning to expel the student.
hsin-mei said that until they got to chitin they would have to pool all their money for general use. Not a copper could be wasted.
hsin-mei said to hung-chien, "we'll leave together in a little while. Don't forget."
hsin-mei said, "I smoke a pipe and have tobacco with me, so I won't need to buy tiny on the way. But I won't smoke any more from now on, so you won't get envious watching me."
hsin-mei said, "actually those two tickets should go to you older gentlemen. We young people should put up with a little discomfort."
hsin-mei said, "don't worry, fatigue will conquer all the little pains and itches. Let's get a good night's sleep first."
hsin-mei said, "our room is the best. It faces the street and gets the most light. There's a net on the bed too, but I don't want to sleep in tile inn's bedding. We'll have to think of something else later on."
hsin-mei took the opportunity, while miss sun wasn't paying attention, to give hung-chien a hefty punch in the back, saying, "mr. fang here loves to tell lies. He's fooling you with fairy tales."
hsin-mei urged her to tell him, but she refused and was going to knock on the door and go in, when hsin-mei held her back with his hand and begged her to tell him.
hsin-mei wanted to call everyone together for dinner again to decide on the departure date.
hsin-mei was about to say, "hung-chien lost. He's fined a glass," when miss su protested on his behalf, "mr. ch'u is really too sharps he's made me too scared to open my mouth.
hsin-mei was the first to step onto the bridge, but after two steps, he retreated, saying his legs had gone limp.
hsin-mei's a married man. It wo n't be like it was before. My plan is for me to go to chungking first by myself, and once I've settled things to come and get you.
hsin-mei, I'm sorry about today. I've spoiled it for everyone. Please go on eating.
hsin-mei, having rid himself of miss fan, was in high spirits, and seeing an exposed area of the child's thigh, which was clean, he put his mouth up close to kiss it. This made all four lius laugh merrily, thinking how wonderful this mr. chao was.
hsin-mei, my mother and I have a social engagement today, so let's eat at the restaurant some other day, all right?
Hsin. Tell him to strip
Hsin. You.

htc also took a page from apple's playbook: pay as much attention to a phone's design as its innards.
htc and samsung have firmly positioned themselves in the high-end market in china, but zte said it expected windows 7.5 phones to be entry-level products.
htc chief executive peter chou, for example, was sent on an mba course at harvard business school to prepare him for the role.
htc chose to make the one s super thin, instead of packing it with more battery power.
htc corp., asia's second-largest smartphone maker, forecast the highest revenue in three quarters and apple inc. (aapl) reported profit that almost doubled last quarter, reflecting robust demand for the iphone in china.
htc devices running windows mobile 5.0 are not affected because the obex ftp service is not implemented in that os version.
htc expects the handsets will be available to consumers in september or october.
htc firestone is one of upcoming phones from htc which is yet to be announced.
htc followed the tried-and-true taiwanese outsourcing formula of designing and manufacturing gadgets for other companies without a brand name of its own.
htc has a 4.5 per cent share of the mainland chinese market, boosted from 4.1 per cent a year ago by its popular desire line of mid-tier phones.
htc has a wide global distribution network and close relations with major operators, making it a 'tempting takeover or merger target,' said neil mawston, executive director at market research firm strategy analytics.

htc's answer is so-called boomsound dual stereo speakers.
htc's decline accelerated as google bought motorola mobility and as apple won a court ban on some htc handsets.
htc's family of smartphones has it all: a blazing-fast quad-core tegra 3 processor, vibrant, huge displays, loud beats audio, and a striking design that few android devices can't match.
htc's new flagship phone is due april 19 for$ 199 with a contract.
htc's new windows phone 7 handsets allow microsoft users to connect with their xbox live games and zune music, and some businesses want easy access to office applications such as word and excel.
htc's one is the company's best chance to win back market share.
htc's peter chou would surely agree.
htc's profile has been further raised this year when apple sued the company for patent infringement, and by the success of its advanced fourth-generation evo phone, which has helped sprint nextel compete with rival network at& t's apple iphone offerings in the us.
htc's sales have halved in the past six months.

munster also argues that since these apple devices would perform closely enough to the iphone, the need for the iphone itself or tablet could become null and void.
munster and clinton predict an apple tv will measure 42 "to 55" and cost between$ 1500 and$ 2000.
munster came to the same conclusion, although perhaps by a different route.
munster estimates that google will generate about$ 4.5 billion in gross mobile revenue in 2012, the lion's share ($ 4 billion) from search ads and the rest ($ 500 million) from display.
munster estimates that if apple were to sell 5 to 10 million units, that would add 1% to 2% to apple's annual revenues.
munster expects a rapid sequence of new products and product updates over the next 12 months, including a new iphone, new macs, a new ipad and a tv.
munster expects the number of apple announcements to increase as the pace of product upgrade cycles become shorter.
munster hasn't lost the faith.
munster pointed not to search or other advertising, which still accounts for 87% of the company's revenue, but to new ventures that have yet to hit the market, like google glass and self-driving cars, which he called one of google's "biggest opportunities in the next 10 years."
munster thinks the tv will include siri and facetime features but not unbundled channels.
munster views the "wearable computer" as a major future tech trend and one significant, untapped revenue stream for apple (aapl).

musharraf has been accused of placing chief justice iftikhar mohammed chaudhry and his family members under illegal detention when musharraf, as president, clamped a brief emergency rule on the country in late 2007.
