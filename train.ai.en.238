well, yeah, I don't feel like I'm a priority anymore.

well, yeah, I know I've been doing some backtracking to,
well, yeah, I know, but...
well, yeah, I know, but... Your world can spin without you
well, yeah, I know. I know.
well, yeah, I may have it written down someplace.
well, yeah, I mean - yeah, I'm - I'm honestly -
well, yeah, I mean Janie dragged me
well, yeah, I mean, I could've told you that part.
well, yeah, I mean, I used the case as an excuse, but I'm not going to do it again.

well, yeah, I mean, I'm just saying...
well, yeah, I mean, as long as I'm back for

well, yeah, I mean, if you use a condom.
well, yeah, I mean, just a few.
well, yeah, I mean, my parents locked the liquor cabinet, so I.
well, yeah, I mean, that's - that's how I do it. I mean...
well, yeah, I mean, that's... That's how I do it. I mean...
well, yeah, I mean, together here or in the city.
well, yeah, I mean, we're like...
well, yeah, I mean, we're like...
well, yeah, I mean, you never know what kind of weirdo you might meet.
well, yeah, I mean, you saw him, right?
well, yeah, I mean, you're the one
well, yeah, I mean... Mr. And Mrs. Russo.
well, yeah, I miss you, too.
well, yeah, I realize it's not your fault that the meeting got postponed,
well, yeah, I realize it's not your fault that the meeting got postponed,
well, yeah, I resolved things a little bit early.
well, yeah, I said it. I didn't mean it.
well, yeah, I seen it. Uh, drove alongside this girl walking.
well, yeah, I suppose I am actually, aren't I?
well, yeah, I suppose I am actually, aren't I?
well, yeah, I suppose they are.
well, yeah, I suppose they could have been there more. Sure.
well, yeah, I suppose.
well, yeah, I talked to him on the phone.
well, yeah, I think it's because I like to show off
well, yeah, I think it's because I like to show off
well, yeah, I think she's got a really good chance of winning.
well, yeah, I think we're gonna stick with the pizza. No biggie. More for me.
well, yeah, I thought of that, but, uh,
well, yeah, I thought so, too.
well, yeah, I thought that was just - then I have your consent.
well, yeah, I thought that's what you...
well, yeah, I thought there... Was.
well, yeah, I thought you were here about the other murder.
well, yeah, I understand, but...
well, yeah, I was burning off a little of my extra desire on the way to work, sweet pea.
well, yeah, I was deliberately trying to get to the sink.
well, yeah, I was deliberately trying
well, yeah, I was there, but I didn't take her.
well, yeah, I was,
well, yeah, I was,
well, yeah, I will later.
well, yeah, I'd say that, too,
well, yeah, I'll talk to him, but I'm not gonna tell him what to do.
well, yeah, I'm a detective.
well, yeah, I'm gonna be the people's champ.
well, yeah, I'm here.
well, yeah, I'm just trying to give him perspective.
well, yeah, I'm leaving. - Dave, you're my ride home.
well, yeah, I'm right, so just stay and let me guess.
well, yeah, I'm right,
well, yeah, I'm supposed to be staying with them.
well, yeah, I'm sure he's probably just the world's
well, yeah, I'm trying to make sure that when the baby comes -
well, yeah, I've been known to take a spill or two,
well, yeah, I've been meaning to do that.
well, yeah, I've been pretty busy working out of town.
well, yeah, I've been pretty busy working out of town.
well, yeah, I've had a lot of those thrown at me over the years.
well, yeah, McGee, I'm alive.
well, yeah, OK, but she's super smart.
well, yeah, Sunday's fine. Yeah.
well, yeah, a bit
well, yeah, actually, I do -
well, yeah, actually, I had one.
well, yeah, actually, I had one.
well, yeah, actually. I'm a different guy now.
well, yeah, after work, there may have been a few
well, yeah, after you served, um,
well, yeah, all right.
well, yeah, all right. Yes, okay.
well, yeah, all the time.
well, yeah, and I happen to agree with him, mother.
well, yeah, and I thought we could spend Valentine's day together.
well, yeah, and I thought we could spend uh,
well, yeah, and I'm sad.
well, yeah, and a bigger paycheck a - and bigger cases... All of those things.
well, yeah, and a bigger paycheck a - and bigger cases... All of those things.
well, yeah, and a bigger paycheck
well, yeah, and they're totally unenforceable.
well, yeah, anyone can. That doesn't mean that anyone shouId.
well, yeah, anyone can. That doesn't mean that anyone should.
well, yeah, apparently you made them count.
well, yeah, as soon as I saw the baby, I... I didn't really notice anything else.
well, yeah, back when it was a free range chicken ranch.
well, yeah, because I know some things about him.
well, yeah, because I thought we had fun together,
well, yeah, because I'm throwing a party, remember?
well, yeah, because I'm worried that you're just running away.
well, yeah, because he didn't get in
well, yeah, because if she wasn't terrible, Naples,
well, yeah, because if that trashy, big - lipped slag said it,
well, yeah, because if that trashy, big - lipped slag said it,
well, yeah, because it's anger management.
well, yeah, because of this condo conversion.
well, yeah, because some of the nurses wanted me to check on their patients,
well, yeah, because when you two were inside
well, yeah, because when you two were inside
well, yeah, because you said it was cool.
well, yeah, because you write such a - such a good essay.
well, yeah, before they started shooting at it.
well, yeah, beggars can't be choosers, right?
well, yeah, believe me I've had plenty of colleagues have gone down that route,
well, yeah, believe me, I've had plenty of colleagues who have gone down that route,
well, yeah, besides nightmares for the next three weeks.
well, yeah, but - but it's contaminated.
well, yeah, but - but they're not,
well, yeah, but - it's basically the same thing.
well, yeah, but - it's no different.
well, yeah, but I aren't marrying him.
well, yeah, but I can change it if we have to.
well, yeah, but I could get another one.
well, yeah, but I didn't think it was a big deal.
well, yeah, but I don't know how to start a blog. I could help you.
well, yeah, but I don't love her.
well, yeah, but I don't see a lot of old - timey ladies
well, yeah, but I don't think he minds.
well, yeah, but I don't think we knew that "curse word" meant...
well, yeah, but I figured
well, yeah, but I mean,
well, yeah, but I mean, anyone would in that position.
well, yeah, but I mean, that was, you know -
well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her.
well, yeah, but I never wanted to kill her. Never.
well, yeah, but I think that - - I want to be better.
well, yeah, but I think that - - I want to be better.
well, yeah, but I was team equipment manager.
well, yeah, but I'm pretty sure they probably don't want to go to college anyway.
well, yeah, but I'm sure, you know, that there are...
well, yeah, but also...
well, yeah, but as long as no one's crowning,
well, yeah, but don't they seem,
well, yeah, but every kid deserves two parents.
well, yeah, but everybody's turned it in.
well, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
well, yeah, but first, I was kind of hoping...
well, yeah, but he doesn't need to be here.
well, yeah, but he seems hell bent on marrying mom.
well, yeah, but he was somebody's baby, too, and I want our baby to know that.
well, yeah, but he was somebody's baby, too,
well, yeah, but if you had put me on this when I asked, I would've been free. I didn't. I'm not doing anything.
well, yeah, but if you stood up for her...
well, yeah, but in this case, instead of an explosion, you get this.
well, yeah, but it comes with the job.
well, yeah, but it may not be wise to send him out there.
well, yeah, but it was after hours.
well, yeah, but it'd be a great tease.
well, yeah, but it's a lot worse than it sounds.
well, yeah, but it's just a hunch. I don't even know why.
well, yeah, but it's not clear enough to me what you're seeing that should be different.
well, yeah, but it's not like it's the first time you've ever told him that.
well, yeah, but it's not like we're out on the street...
well, yeah, but just because....
well, yeah, but just for the weekend.
well, yeah, but legally, we're accomplices, so I mean... Could you shut up?
well, yeah, but let's take a look at your footage first.
well, yeah, but look. I mean, he's educated and ambitious.
well, yeah, but maybe it didn't have enough time, panicked, and took off.
well, yeah, but maybe it didn't have enough time,
well, yeah, but not all at once.
well, yeah, but not even a call? To explain?
well, yeah, but not me. I got suspended a game.
well, yeah, but nothing like that.
well, yeah, but only long enough to destroy this lab.
well, yeah, but rather than get her out of town
well, yeah, but scary good, right?
well, yeah, but she looked so beautiful in it.
well, yeah, but she promised she would be there.
well, yeah, but she sounds like she's got a lot going for her.
well, yeah, but she's not gonna have a party if I'm there.
well, yeah, but she's not gonnahave a party if I'm there.
well, yeah, but she's not gonnahave a party if I'm there.
well, yeah, but some people might think
well, yeah, but some people might think
well, yeah, but somebody's gotta know which door to go through.
well, yeah, but still.
well, yeah, but th is really soon.
well, yeah, but that doesn't explain why we heard
well, yeah, but that doesn't mean I can't go to school married.
well, yeah, but that doesn't mean I can't go to school married.
well, yeah, but that doesn't mean
well, yeah, but that has nothing to do with the trick.
well, yeah, but that was gonna take a couple of hours, and I'm swamped with work.
well, yeah, but that's for Bermuda in the fall.
well, yeah, but that's what everybody's...
well, yeah, but that?
well, yeah, but then you said that...
well, yeah, but there's a special guest coming
well, yeah, but these are good, too.
well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.
well, yeah, but this isn't just about looks.
well, yeah, but we didn't always...
well, yeah, but we like to entertain.
well, yeah, but we wanna get there early.
well, yeah, but weren't we just saying that to SC...
well, yeah, but what do people ask for
well, yeah, but what does that have to do with anything?
well, yeah, but what good would that do?
well, yeah, but what if we turn off our mic packs?
well, yeah, but what is it?
well, yeah, but when it got right down to the moment,
well, yeah, but when she's gone, she's a rock star.
well, yeah, but why do you say it like that?
well, yeah, but you can't just put out a few slices.
well, yeah, but you could still use it as sort of a telegraph, right?
well, yeah, but you didn't call the second ball,
well, yeah, but you don't actually believe that we've been visited by aliens, do you?
well, yeah, but you guys aren't. So -
well, yeah, but you know, you never know.
well, yeah, but you think everyone's an asshole.
well, yeah, but you wear it ironically,
well, yeah, but you're busy,
well, yeah, but you're on the road all the time.
well, yeah, but you're running unopposed, right?
well, yeah, but your number is so small, and my number is so big.
well, yeah, but, I mean, he said could party with his credit card.
well, yeah, but, I mean, you're not...
well, yeah, but, I mean... I grew up there.
well, yeah, but, couldn't stay away, you know?
well, yeah, but, honey, I didn't make up the rules.
well, yeah, but, then again, you have'small" written all over your... Face.
well, yeah, but, uh...
well, yeah, but, you know,
well, yeah, but, you know, I've signed millions of these in my time.
well, yeah, but, you know, after this
well, yeah, but, you know, he asked her, and she said yes,
well, yeah, but, you know, there's a lot to be said for clean, orderly, simple.
well, yeah, but... At my wedding reception!
well, yeah, but... Do it!
well, yeah, but... Ghosts?
well, yeah, but... Hey, what's that?
well, yeah, but... I'm talking just the two of us.
well, yeah, but... It's no big deal.
well, yeah, but... We have nothing in common.
well, yeah, but... wouldn't that have come up in the investigation?
well, yeah, call me if she's interested.
well, yeah, call me if she's interested.
well, yeah, can we get more towels up here, then?
well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't remember their first almost - kiss?
well, yeah, comparatively speaking.
well, yeah, could you take care of that?
well, yeah, course I do. He's my brother, isn't he?
well, yeah, course he had a job.
well, yeah, course.
well, yeah, depending on the desired behaviour.
well, yeah, detective.
well, yeah, detective. If I would've been in there, I wouldn't be out here.
well, yeah, did you hear your speech? Come on, let's go back.
well, yeah, doc, there's a problem.
well, yeah, don't get excited.
well, yeah, duh. But major fire - wall age.
well, yeah, especially for a job in the public sector.
well, yeah, except that we promised to switch seats once we hit Pennsylvania.
well, yeah, for starters, you can help me get up off this table.
well, yeah, from the lifeguard station.
well, yeah, hang on, don't...
well, yeah, he broke off the engagement.
well, yeah, he brought it up in the locker room.
well, yeah, he couldn't have just gotten up
well, yeah, he couldn't have just gotten up and walked out of there.
well, yeah, he didn't exactly fit your ideal agent parameters.
well, yeah, he didn't have the funds in escrow to cover the payouts.
well, yeah, he had a gun.
well, yeah, he set it all up about two weeks ago.
well, yeah, he was a sales rep for a jet leasing company.
well, yeah, he was. But he left
well, yeah, he was.
well, yeah, he's Lee.
well, yeah, he's a douche, but that doesn't mean he's beating up on his kid.
well, yeah, he's cute, but I haven't said one intelligent thing since I met the guy.
well, yeah, he's mentally ill, I mean.
well, yeah, he's out of range, I, I gotta track him down.
well, yeah, he's out of range. I got to track him down.
well, yeah, he's probably capable. He's an animal, isn't he?
well, yeah, he's probably capable. He's an animal, isn't he?
well, yeah, he's sitting right here working on it.
well, yeah, he's sort of my manager too.
well, yeah, he's sort of my manager too.
well, yeah, he, uh, he didn't come here much.
well, yeah, hey, you're good to go in.
well, yeah, him or anybody else with a shortwave radio.
well, yeah, his number's listed,
well, yeah, honey, in theory,
well, yeah, honey, in theory,
well, yeah, how the hell was I to know? Yeah, well, that's it.
well, yeah, if God is punitive.
well, yeah, if I had an electron microscope and two weeks, maybe.
well, yeah, if I was standing right here, but I was over there making coffee.
well, yeah, if it - if it moves beyond the protective shielding,
well, yeah, if it means one of us getting a full night's sleep.
well, yeah, if somebody doesn't kill you
well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.
well, yeah, if you don't get a baby in a crib pretty early,
well, yeah, if you drink blood.
well, yeah, if you're clever enough.
well, yeah, if you're not taking into account that
well, yeah, in Chicago, but here we barely have streets.
well, yeah, in Chicago, but here we barely have streets.
well, yeah, in Chicago, but
well, yeah, in a cheap kind of a way.
well, yeah, in a couple of the scenes.
well, yeah, in my defense, I was a teenager. She had a beach house.
well, yeah, in my defense, I was a teenager. She had a beach house.
well, yeah, in my defense, I was a teenager.
well, yeah, in so many words.
well, yeah, it could be linked to a pacemaker in his chest.
well, yeah, it definitely feels like crime and punishment.
well, yeah, it does.
well, yeah, it ended.
well, yeah, it happens, but not to us.
well, yeah, it is a crazy love, though.
well, yeah, it is likely that they are going to
well, yeah, it is likely that they are going to want to choose a target that offers a greater payout.
well, yeah, it is rush hour.
well, yeah, it is, but you know... - you're arguing now.
well, yeah, it is.
well, yeah, it kind of does, actually.
well, yeah, it never came up again
well, yeah, it should. I just got tested.
well, yeah, it took years to figure that out.
well, yeah, it was a long time ago, OK?
well, yeah, it was a long time out there.
well, yeah, it was cutting. I just cut in line.
well, yeah, it was really easy for me
well, yeah, it was the one smoking area.
well, yeah, it wasn't quite what I expected.
well, yeah, it worries me. But he's a grown man,
well, yeah, it worries me. But he's a grown man, he can take care of himself. - What about his mother?
well, yeah, it worries me. But he's a grown man, he can take care of himself.
well, yeah, it worries me. But he's a grown man,
well, yeah, it's - it's okay.
well, yeah, it's an ongoing offensive against neighborhood evil.
well, yeah, it's because you're full of endorphins.
well, yeah, it's dirt.
well, yeah, it's extra padding, you know, for long hours of contemplation.
well, yeah, it's gotta be the same woman. She killed at each robbery.
well, yeah, it's great.
well, yeah, it's it's a good area to be in.
well, yeah, it's just a token of my appreciation
well, yeah, it's just more of like a dress shirt and jeans combo,
well, yeah, it's just more of like a dress shirt and jeans combo,
well, yeah, it's likely that our guy
well, yeah, it's likely that our guy
well, yeah, it's not a joke
well, yeah, it's off and on.
well, yeah, it's perfectly understandable.
well, yeah, it's possible.
well, yeah, it's sorta bad.
well, yeah, it's very easy.
well, yeah, it's very important to make a good first impression.
well, yeah, it's very important to make a good first impression.
well, yeah, it's wiped out all the other evidence as far as I can see.
well, yeah, it's your fault.
well, yeah, it, uh, does send a hell of a message, sir.
well, yeah, journalism, and then there were the core classes and some, you know, electives and stuff.
well, yeah, just until we get the rhythm section all dialed in.
well, yeah, kind of.
well, yeah, kind of. More like a louse.
well, yeah, kind of.
well, yeah, l guess it might at that.
well, yeah, l mean, l know what it is.
well, yeah, legally, absolutely.
well, yeah, let's get his phone calls monitored.
well, yeah, like, I could be waiting for the man I love,
well, yeah, look at his record -
well, yeah, man. I thought it was pretty good.
well, yeah, man. I thought it was pretty good.
well, yeah, mate,
well, yeah, maybe you've got time, but...
well, yeah, maybe. - I don't believe this.
well, yeah, maybe.
well, yeah, me too, but someone's in trouble.
well, yeah, me, too, but he already asked.
well, yeah, mommy made me promise I'd come
well, yeah, mommy made me promise I'd come so she'd have somebody to gossip with
well, yeah, more or less.
well, yeah, more or less. You know, I go where I'm needed.
well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.
well, yeah, my alter ego, I supposed you might say.
well, yeah, my office is just right here.
well, yeah, my ringer thing got turned off.
well, yeah, no, I'm glad I could help.
well, yeah, nobody has to call anybody, right?
well, yeah, normal is very hard.
