Rennard had disconnected from her parents twice.
Rennard had grown up in a scientology household and joined the church herself at the age of seventeen.

Rennard was told that if she maintained contact with her parents she would be labelled a "potential trouble source"-a designation that would alienate her from the scientology community and render her ineligible for further training.
