with equity and credit market valuations back at fair value and government bond valuations bordering on a bubble, the zero interest rate and quantitative easing policies are no longer entirely warranted from a purely financial market perspective.

with erosion and everything else, suddenly they appear,

with establishment and enabling of china. Afta (asean free trade area), our country will closely cooperate with asean in investment and trade activities, inevitably leading to increasing cases of civil and commercial legal relations.

with eudc you can form asian names and other asian words using characters that are not available in standard screen and printer fonts.
with euro interest rates rising, the housing bubble could well burst, pulling the rug out from under a construction sector that accounts for 16% of gdp and 12% of employment.
with europe again imposing its will on the rest of the imf membership, she will need to hit the ground running if her tenure is to bring about institutional transformation, and not maintain a myopic approach to a critical international post.
with europe and japan little better, it now looks as though the bungee-jump economic recovery from last year's abyss has lost its momentum.
with europe and japan on a path of slow economic growth, it is imperative corporate america reconfigure and restructure its global infrastructure for the global economy of tomorrow.
with europe and the united states mired in economic stagnation, latin american leaders can survey the world with a certain smugness.

with europe mired in its debt crisis and america managing only a sluggish recovery, china's long boom has seemed a rare bright spot for equity investors.
with europe perhaps headed into recession, the u. s.struggling with a fragile recovery, and japan battered, china's export growth has been flagging, with expectations of worse to come.
with europe struggling and the us recovery appearing to ebb, signs of strength from china, the world's second-largest economy, could still help allay fears of a global slowdown.
with europe's creditworthiness sliding and the us economy drifting, emerging market economies look particularly inviting.
with europe's debt crisis dragging on and the us mired in a sluggish recovery, the potential for mis-steps in china of insufficient policy relaxation leading to a sharp drop in growth is an unwanted risk for the global economy.
with european inflation at its highest levels since the 1990s, squeezing the purchasing power of millions of workers and unemployed, private sector executives should show a greater sense of social responsibility, several ministers said.
with european leaders around him tottering, mr sarkozy is not about to embark on unpopular structural reform of the welfare state.
with european oil companies still operating and his oil wealth continuing to grow, he financed other terrorist groups.
