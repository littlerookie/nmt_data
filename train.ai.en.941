what? I just got here!
now you're turning around and leaving? Really?
daddy, I have a murder!
now where are you going?
Charlie, it was sweet of you to stick up for me, but -- I'm not ready to go home yet.
well, I guess I'm just a chauffeur, come here to take Charlene home.
Charlie, you can't stay here. Your parents
no, my parents don't understand me at all.
my dad thinks I'm still 8, and my mom -- they just
they don't know me anymore, at least not the way you and uncle Fritz do.
I-I feel like I'm a different person here than I am at home.
look, honey, I understand what you're going through.
one second. Give me one second.
I-I did some things when I first got here, and I'm really sorry for that, but I feel like, especially in this past week, we've become so much closer.
we have, haven't we?
I might be closer to you and uncle Fritz than I am to anyone else in the whole world.
please don't make me go home yet.
look, Charlie, before we even talk about your staying here, you're gonna have to convince grandpa to leave you behind.
I can do that.
well, you manage that, and we'll... see what we can do.
Fritzi, I didn't know you were back.
Hey, uncle Fritz.
thank you.
when I said I wanted kids, I didn't mean other people's.
Oh, don't worry about that.
daddy's never gonna let her stay here in a million years.
although, I do wish she lived nearer, don't you?
not in the next bedroom.
do you have my vicap results?
as a matter of fact, I do.
using strict parameters -- home invasion, after-dark, stabbing, left-hander, no sexual component
I found 85 murders resembling your killing.
85? - And my old buddy Tom Welch...you remember him?
he just got assigned to the juarez task force in El Paso.
he's drying by Mejores Motors to check on your suspect's mustang.
Oh, thank you, Fritzi!
what?
Charlie is going.
Yes, yes, yes. I know. I know.
clay: If I wanted to be ignored by my family, I could have stayed home.
chief Johnson.
I believe you've already spoken with detective Landry.
so nice to meet you, chief.
very glad to get your call this morning. That's the truth.
and so kind of you to fly all this way just to brief me, detective.
now, as I seem to be joining y'all a bit late, um, maybe you could catch me up.
ma'am. - Thank you.
well, since detective Landry has been kind enough to share his concerns with me,
I will now share mine with you.
before we alert the people of Los Angeles that there is a ninja on the loose,
I'd like to be dead sure we're talking about the same person.
I have some questions about that myself.
these are the young women who were murdered in El Paso who I imagine you think were killed by the same person who murdered my victim last night.
now, while I do see similarities, nowhere in these articles does it mention that the attacker was a ninja.
well, I was afraid that if we released that particular detail to the press, the next time the killer struck, he'd likely be dressed as a rodeo clown or perhaps a nun.
was there anything else that you withheld from the press?
that does seem like a fair place to begin.
fine.
how about I tell you what I believe and what I don't believe.
I believe, four months ago, your killer stabbed to death joann hosey, living on the west side of el paso, taking care of a father with terminal cancer, and then, two months later, the same man cut up juanita jimenez, a young mother of three, slicing her face up so bad,
I had to roll her prints to get an I. D. on her.
that's what I believe.
and now I'll tell you what I don't believe.
and I realize that y'all probably see all manner of weird killers out this way, but I don't put a lot of stock in ninjas, and I feel fairly certain, when we find this boy, he'll be a white male, 25 to 40, with self-esteem issues he richly deserves.
now, I'd like to help you grab this guy and take him back to texas, where we can try him and fry him, or, as we might say in this day and age, "collect him and inject him,
which I imagine is about as close as we're gonna get to a happy ending here.
as I see it, sir, the problem with your happy ending is it leaves too many unanswered questions for the relatives of other victims he seems to have left scattered across several states.
well, that's fair enough.
suppose we try this.
assuming we catch this little bastard, whichever of us ends up with the better evidence gets to take this guy to trial.
detective, if you want to make a deal, why don't you start by telling us something we can't get from vicap?
okay. How about this...
you said your fellow was driving a car from El Paso?
well, in El Paso, our man was driving a car from California.
well, you guys did a great job on this.
fast, too.
may I give you a little hint?
he never killed in Holbrook.
gallup, new Mexico -- that was a domestic thing.
terrible stabbing in Sonora, but he's on death row.
Bowie, Arizona -- remember that town.
if you like Tex-Mex, there is no place better.
used to be an outback. Guy that took it over did a bang-up job.
here, you want to see what connects them all?
of course.
Los Angeles to Phoenix, Tucson to El Paso, up to Houston.
it's the I-10.
he's getting off the highway to find his victims.
bingo. - Do you have any DNA matches?
no law-enforcement agency's entered any DNA into the national database on this guy.
chief? Agent Howard.
thank you. Pardon me.
here she is.
Thanks.
you ready for more info on your El Paso car?
Oh, Fritzi, how can I thank you?
wait until your dad and Charlie leave, and I'll come up with something wholly inappropriate.
Mejores Motors only sold one vintage red mustang in the last two years to a jeffrey web b of El Paso who recently relocated to Los Angeles.
faxing everything over to you right now.
Oh, Fritzi, thank you so much. I'll see you tonight.
tao: Besides the mustang, dmv records show that jeffrey webb has six cars registered to him, all purchased in texas.
he's also been having serious marital issues -- multiple restraining orders.
wife describes a volatile temper and physical abuse.
chief, Webb's definitely not inside.
we're rinsing the drains for blood now.
we checked the garbage and the hamper. So far, nothing.
well, the car itself is spotless, but we did find this souvenir lighter from lake Havasu with a great big thumbprint on it.
Hey, chief, that's him. That's webb.
excuse me, sir. - What the hell's going on here?
Mr. Webb. - That's my car!
that's exactly what we wanted to hear.
are you Jeffrey Webb?
what? Did that bitch tell you I raped her?
look, it's all lies.
why don't you take a breath, son?
no.
no way I'm going back to Texas!
give me your hands!
give me your hands!
okay! Okay! - Turn around!
hands behind your head! Behind your head!
where you running to, boy?
I never touched her.
the only reason she's doing all this is 'cause I wanted the divorce!
Mr. Webb, I don't know to what you are referring, but we have reason to believe that your car was used in the commission of a homicide.
what are you, nuts?
where were you last night?
I was here, inside my house.
excuse me! I'm asking the questions here!
he's not your guy.
what about your car? Was that here, too?
I have no idea where my car was.
I only picked it up this morning at a depot near the airport.
before then, it could have been anywhere between here and El Paso.
look!
I have a receipt!
let me see.
here.
check with the shipping office and find out...
chief, I don't understand.
if Webb is telling the truth and someone from the depot had the car and killed the price woman...
it wouldn't explain the killings out of state.
well, the killer wasn't from the depot.
he was the person transporting the cars, using them for the murders.
I'm assuming that's what you got your man Tao working on now, trying to find the name of the driver.
nice to have your own people about.
chief.
auto shipper says the car was delivered this morning off a rig out of Houston.
driver's name is Jesse Ray Moore.
an hour ago, he loaded up with another shipment bound for Texas.
sergeant Gabriel, detective Sanchez, would y'all get on the 10 and start heading east?
lieutenant Tao, let's put a want out for Jesse Ray Moore and get pictures to every agency between here and Houston.
chief, you realize it's possible the first place they're gonna stop Moore is the scales across the Arizona border, in which case -- he'll be coming back to Texas with me.
unless -- unless one of the cars Mr. Moore's shipping has one of those vehicle-locator thingamajigs.
lojack. Let me get on that, chief.
detective Landry, you don't need to come -- Don't you worry.
I won't let you lose me.
air 19.
we have your lojack signal.
your car carrier's still at the truck stop.
Gabriel: Roger that, air 19. Any sign of the driver?
that's a negative.
we can't see anyone in the cab and no one walking away.
okay, green Crown Vic, the truck's right in front of you, and I still don't see the driver.
there's the truck.
it's locked!
all right, all right!
you check the restaurant.
I'll check the convenience store.
Isera!
just one.
he's not in there!
not inside.
hold it!
stop!
pull over!
stop the vehicle!
pull over!
pilot: Control, I got an officer on the vehicle.
code three. Code three.
officer needs help.
air 19, this is chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I'll be there in two minutes.
Yeah, roger. Advised. En route, two-minute E. T.A.
control, notify sheriff's department. We need backup now.
pull over!
pull over or I'm gonna blow your head off!
we got an officer hanging out of the side of the big rig.
we're coming up on a blue flatbed truck.
we are proceeding Westbound -- Red Valley Road.
moved out of the way. Got right out of the way.
lieutenant Tao?
you son of a bitch!
lieutenant Tao!
air 19, where's my backup?
pilot: Yeah, Roger that.
Hey, control, if you've got the sheriffs on board, get the sheriffs a little closer.
we need somebody here now.
all right, coming to a construction site now, guys.
I don't know where he's gonna go on this one.
detective Sanchez, that's enough!
I think he broke my arm! - Take it easy!
I know my rights! I'm not saying nothing without a lawyer!
Oh, that's a good catch.
I don't think we're tossing this one back.
get up!
stand up!
look what you did to my car!
Gabriel: So, we found no blood or weapons in Jesse Ray Moore's truck.
why do they always have three names?
okay, gentlemen, let me be clear.
at the moment, we can only prosecute Mr. Moore for assault on a police officer and reckless driving.
I'm looking for evidence of murder.
tao: Chief, for what it's worth, we found this collection of random items in his lockbox, 16 in all, including an ashtray, though, the only fingerprints on them belong to Jesse Ray Moore.
that's it?
well, keep looking. He's got to have those knives somewhere and call the print shed.
tell them to take that 18-wheeler down to the very -- No, don't bother with that, ma'am.
I wasn't gonna trouble y'all with it before, but Mr. Moore has some scratches on his neck that go a long way to closing my case.
scratches?
how did you know those scratches were gonna be there?
Juanita Jimenez, the little Latina lady that we talked about, before she died, she put up a pretty good fight and got a little skin and blood under her nails.
since our killer was dressed in black and wore a mask,
I figured the neck was the only place it could have come from.
you have DNA!
when I asked you if you had a match
and I told you truthfully that no law-enforcement agency had entered his DNA into the national database.
because you with held it!
I didn't with hold anything.
I just don't have the staff you've got.
it takes a while to get all this done.
but I think you've done exceptional work.
and now if you could just turn Mr. Moore over to me.
we agreed that whoever had the best evidence would retain custody.
that we did, and, frankly, ma'am, there is no conceivable universe wherein you have better evidence than I do.
not at the moment, maybe, but right now, my detectives are looking through every single car Mr. Moore delivered over the past two years.
and good luck with that.
in the meantime, I'm gonna get a nice little extradition order for you.
have a pleasant evening, ma'am.
incredible. What a mess out there.
well, that was Fntana about 3: 00 today after Los Angeles police officers investigating reports that a murder suspect might be fleeing in a car carrier bound for the state line confronted the man in a truck right on I-10.
congratulations, honey. It's all over the news.
you actually got this creep.
Yeah, only I may have to give him away.
so what if this Landry guy takes him off your hands?
no state dispenses justice like Texas.
if by "justice" you mean executing a man before we know everything he's done, I disagree.
I'm not arguing it's a perfect solution, only that -- Oh.
daddy, I'm sorry. Did we wake you up?
Oh, no matter.
at my age, I sleep better in the daytime, anyway.
besides, I've got something I need to talk to both of you about.
Oh, god.
before she went to bed, Charlene gave me a convincing argument as to why she should stay out here in California with you.
she's even found something called a magnet school, whatever that is.
she gave me a pamphlet on it.
but the point is she does not want to go home.
and what did you say?
I told her that, uh, whether she stays here or goes is entirely up to you.
daddy! - Oh, my god!
look, I know you want me to be the bad guy here, but my main job as Charlene's grandfather is not to be resented and to say "yes" to every little thing she wants.
besides, I refuse to spend five hours on an airplane with a teenager who thinks it's a terrible punishment to fly back to Atlanta with me next to staying here with you in California.
did -- did you hear what your father just said?
Yes.
and it makes perfect sense.
how's that extradition order coming along, Mr. Landry?
well, the judge has my paperwork.
shouldn't be long before the good people of Texas have Mr. Moore on death row.
the material you asked for, chief.
thank you, lieutenant.
detective Sanchez, sergeant Gabriel, lieutenant Flynn, would y'all join me, please?
well, now, you do realize, ma'am, you can't question him without his lawyer present.
I don't intend to question him.
I intend to have him revoke his right to an attorney, and then I intend to watch him confess.
lieutenant Tao, would you please join us?
make sure to bring along everything we found in mr. Moore's lockbox and also your camera with the big flash.
the big outdoor -- really?
okay.
so, you're really going in there with this guy when you know next to nothing about him?
I know the one thing we really need to know.
what's that?
he ran.
Mr. Moore, I don't think we were properly introduced yesterday.
I'm chief Johnson.
I expect you remember detective Sanchez.
he certainly remembers you.
now, I understand you don't want to speak without your attorney present, and that's just fine with me, but I will need you to undress.
now.
why are we doing this?
we're photographing you for any wounds, blemishes, and physical defects that might link you to the crimes for which you're being investigated.
lieutenant Tao.
why is that so bright? It's blinding me!
we're just preparing you for what you'll experience after you've been found guilty of murder in the great state of Texas and they send you to the electric chair, put 50, 000 volts through the top of your head.
well, that's not fair.
we don't electrocute people anymore.
we're not savages.
...Gel on you to reduce the amount of seared flesh, but that won't stop your brain from boiling inside of your skull, but that's sort of the point, isn't it?
where is she headed with that?
I think she's about to take your suspect away from you.
lieutenant Tao, that will do.
Hey, give those back!
those aren't your clothes anymore, sir.
that's evidence.
detective, you'll see to it that that gets to the right people?
thank you.
now...
I want you to look at all the people put to death in Texas since February 2006, 84 in all.
Tommy Lynn Hawkins, executed after six months of being on death row.
michael Jack Raleigh, executed one year after his conviction.
you get the idea?
and these are all the people put to death in California during the same time period.
not one.
but since you have a lawyer and you won't talk to me,
I'm walking out of here right now and turning you over to Texas.
and trust me when I tell you that they will kill you dead.
no, please!
don't -- don't let them send me back to Texas.
I want to stay here.
I wish I could help, you know, but there's not a thing I can do, not while you insist on having an attorney.
I don't want an attorney!
I want to talk to you!
but...I... I don't know how.
there are just so many things I never said out loud.
how do I... how do I tell you?
well... I have an idea.
why don't we start with these?
we found them in your lockbox.
I'm guessing that they're souvenirs?
aren't they?
you don't have to say.
you can just nod if you want.
I thought so.
why don't you show me where all of these objects came from?
gentlemen, why don't we, um, get Mr. Moore here something to put on?
you can call me Jesse.
okay... Jesse.
you can call me Brenda.
now, all of these objects are unique, but I'm guessing the first one that you ever collected, that's extra special.
which one would that be?
when you try so hard to get something right, you don't want to forget it.
though, when I look in this mirror, I can almost see her looking back.
you want to smell?
where did it come from?
Ozona.
she was coming back from her prom, I think.
she was real pretty.
and did you catch her when she was outside or inside?
do you remember?
Yes, outside.
her boyfriend walked her to the door, and she stood on the front porch, watching him drive away, and... she swayed a little, like she was still dancing.
killing's like having sex, you know?
only you don't have to talk to them after you're done.
right.
right.
still here, detective?
well, she's still here... seven hours later.
I stayed with her for a while.
did you?
something special about a woman's body when the life... drains out of it.
there's a quiet there that's... soothing.
that's everyone?
you're absolutely sure there's no one else?
no, 16 is all.
people, that is.
you don't want to know about the cats or dogs.
I mean, they were just practice, really.
no.
that will do it.
thank you, Jesse.
excuse me.
I'll be back in a bit.
you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. I just needed to...
fine.
that was well done, ma'am.
thank you, detective.
your, uh, help was indispensable.
I don't know about that.
as far as taking Mr. Moore back to Texas with me, I've spent enough time in court to know that no amount of DNA is gonna trump a confession -- much less 16 of them.
I've assured detective Landry that after we convict Mr. Moore and after he serves his life sentences here in California, then Texas can execute him.
and I appreciate that.
well, I brought something with me I thought you might want to duplicate before I get out your hair here.
in that folder's the 16 victims.
I thought you might want a copy of the sweet faces to go along with all those...
souvenirs.
great job again, ma'am.
I'm gonna step in here and call my team back home now, if you don't mind.
Thanks.
Hey, Brenda.
you gonna come visit me in prison?
I appreciate the invitation, Jesse, but I don't get to Texas very often, especially in the limited time you'll be there.
what are you talking about?
an extradition order has been filed already to have you removed from California, and I'm not sure I can fight it.
you told me I was gonna stay here.
well, sometimes these things are out of my hands.
red tape and all that.
you can't do this to me!
Jesse, I think I can.
sit down.
I played that just right.
I know the day you've had, but just prepare yourself.
Brenda Leigh, is that you?
it has been 24 hours since we discussed that situation you're gonna handle with Charlie!
I'm -- Charlene!
you got me doing it!
daddy, you want to know why I'm late?
I've been listening to a man tell me how he stabbed 16 women to death!
well, I love you, too.
just so you're aware of it, we have a 10: 00 A. M.Flight in the morning.
if Charlene doesn't want to get on that plane, I'm leaving without her.
you're gonna make me go back, aren't you?
I know it feels like people are making you do things you don't want to do, but...
...your parents would be devastated if you didn't come back.
but what about me?
what about what I want?
I mean, does that just not matter?
don't you think I've changed since I've been here? I have.
I'm not the same person that I was.
Charlie, who you are, it... it doesn't depend on where you are.
who you are is something you take with you wherever you go.
believe me, even if you don't want to.
do you not want me here?
you drove me crazy for three weeks, and now you're gonna make me cry.
of course I-I want you here.
I do, but...
...we gave you a second chance.
don't you think your parents deserve one, too?
guess I don't have a choice.
and I'm -- I'm coming.
I'm coming again real soon. I promise.
you know, you always say that, and you never do.
well, maybe I deserve a second chance, too.
you'll -- you'll be fine.
you will.
we'll see.
Oh, honey!
uh, you're home. I called your cell.
where... where were you?
uh, I sort of ate.
uh, I can pull out the menus if you want.
no, thanks. I lost my appetite...About an hour ago. It was around the time your friend Captain Raydor Showed up at my office.
apparently my wife is being vetted for chief of police.
and I didn't even know she was in the running.
I'm... I'm not.
look. See? I haven't turned in my application.
how long have you known about this?
only about a week. - A week? A w...
do you have any idea how humiliating it is being blindsided with questions about my D.U.I.S and how many A.A.meetings I attend each week?
I had no idea she was gonna talk to you about this.
Brenda, this is one of the most powerful positions in the city.
people are gonna make damn sure your husband isn't a liability.
well, the only reason Captain Raydor is pushing me for this is because I'm a woman and to make trouble between me and Pope.
and then besides, you were up for a promotion last year, and you never said a word about it.
I never considered it seriously.
well, I'm not considering this seriously, either.
Really? - Really.
why not?
I mean, getting some emotional distance from your cases would be good for you.
and it would be a hell of a lot safer. This job comes with bodyguards.
what about your career?
chief is a five-year commitment.- Oh, don't make this about me.
you couldn't take another job outside of Los Angeles... - I am not holding you back.
for the next five years. Then there'd be all those events and dinners I'd have to go to.
Yeah, as opposed to all the crime scenes you go to now.
and what about Pope?
he's had his heart set on this for years.
what about Pope? Who cares about Pope?!
who would... who... who would take over major crimes?
okay. Now we're getting to it.
for starters, you got three lieutenants in your squad.
promote one of them.
Oh, right. Like it's that easy.
who would I choose?
and there's civil-service issues, and... and it would require a whole lot...
look, do not answer that phone.
of bureaucratic rigmarole that you don't even... damn it.
Yes, Detective. Hello. What is it?
evening, chief.
got rolled out to cover for Hollywood tonight.
apparently they're all at a retirement party.
Brenda, we have to finish this discussion.
I am serious. This is important.
anyway, it's a probable suicide, although we still have to establish a time of death.
we are talking about a job I don't even want!
W-why?
this... this could be an amazing opportunity for you.
that's what I'm saying.
chief, are you there?
they know nothing about this chief business, okay? Just one second.
W... - Yes, Detective.
just start knocking on doors.
and let's confirm suicide before we jump to any conclusions, okay?
uh, I will be there in just... - Provenza can handle a suicide.
this is an important conversation.
they're fighting.
we are not fighting.
now they think we're fighting. - We are fighting!
evening, chief. - Delegate and hang up the phone.
chief, r-really, uh, we're almost done here.
there's no need for you to ruin your evening.
apparently the victim's boyfriend called it in.
and he just so happens to live In the second floor of that apartment building.
just bring him down, huh? - What?
what is that, lieutenant? I can't hear you.
uh, uh, nothing. Nothing, chief.
uh, listen, I have this, okay?
so why don't you just, uh... - Hang up.
...you know... - Hang up. Hang up.
...do whatever you're doing.
um, if it's... if it's anything serious, I'll... I-I-I'll call you.
no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
cross my heart. - Hang up.
don't hang up.
he hung up. - Good.
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.
keep the doors locked. You want anything?
no, I'm good, but it's a little cold.
there you go.
Gina Decker, age 27.
is this her car?
uh, no. The car's registered to a Wayne West.
her boyfriend's name is Wayne.
Yeah, Flynn's bringing him down now.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was at the movies.
yeah? Got a hot date or something?
uh, no, sir.
uh, you know, looking at the blood, There's an absence of high-velocity misting
that's inconsistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
shorter words, Tao.
if she held a gun to her head and pulled the trigger, there would be blowback on her left hand.
buzz, you getting this?
Yes, sir.
wait. Wait. So you're saying you think the driver shot her and left the gun?
look at the spatter here, huh?
nobody was sitting here.
excuse me, sir.
step back.
maybe the driver got out of the car and then shot her through the open window.
well, where is this boyfriend, huh?
Wayne West, meet my pals.
Ah, thank you for joining us, mr. West. You look damp.
do you need a towel?
uh, no, man. No. - Is this your car?
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, you discovered your girlfriend's body in it earlier this evening?
I did. Right.
and then you called the police.
then you thought you would freshen up a bit, maybe take a shower before we got here.
was that a mistake?
Mr. West, uh, we need you to come downtown, make a statement.
Really? Why? You know, I can make a statement right here.
um, uh, I was out with a friend.
I came home.
I found Gina dead in my car.
and that's it.
see, we hate to leave The victim's loved ones behind at the scene, - Especially when they're as upset as you are. - Right.
or are you just a little on edge? - Or on something.
whoa, please, guys.
you... you told me she killed herself.
why are you acting like I had something to do with it?
Oh, the thought never crossed my mind.
although she is parked in front of your apartment.
she lives here, man!
in the passenger seat of your car.
that's her seat.
Julio, I got to go to the bathroom.
lieutenants.
I got him, I got him.
detective.
are you telling me that you have been holding on to this kid for a week?
back here! - Yes, sir.
keep it down!
people are trying to sleep around here!
get back here! Come on!
I thought I made it clear that you were to turn Ruben over to the department of children's services.
I got approved for emergency foster care instead.
when you were supposed to be searching for his mother in Mexico.
detective, this boy is intimately involved in a case that is officially still open.
and we are responsible for his father's death.
the FBI shot Ruben's father, not us.
I know that your intentions are good, Julio, And... and... and...
and I'm not unsympathetic to Ruben's situation, but this is not the proper environment for a child.
worked out okay for your niece.
Hey, watch it.
it is 2: 00 in the morning, Detective.
I hardly think that the scene of a murder or a suicide is any place for a child who just attended his father's funeral.
we were at the movies when the call came in.
I had no time to drop him at my mom's.
I don't think you understand what you're getting into, Julio.
that boy deserves more attention than you can...
sir, you think he's better off in the system instead of with me?
my whole family is helping out, chief.
I worry about what might happen if Ruben grows attached to you and then you are unable to find his mother.
he can end up back in the system. - I will find her.
I certainly hope so.
excuse me.
as the gun moves closer to the head, say, between 6 to 18 inches,
there's a slight gunpowder stippling at the point of entry.
when that stippling is more concentrated, as in the case of the deceased,
the gun was fired 1 to 6 inches from the skull, which is consistent with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
chief, do you believe this?
the good doctor wants to call our victim's death a suicide.
and why shouldn't I, lieutenant?
the body had no signs of a struggle, and she clearly didn't duck.
chief, the boyfriend, Wayne West, has a healthy criminal record that consists of a history of abuse.
come on, Detective. - And he tried to flee the crime scene.
ditching this baggie of meth along the way.
Oh, lieutenant, what happened to your head?
Oh, it's nothing, chief. I just kissed the pavement a bit when I tackled that guy.
kissed the pavement. Listen to him.
uh, hey, doc, don't you think it's a little awkward that she held the gun away from her head?
it's not uncommon for someone to reconsider at the last moment.
doctor, would you mind doing a tox screen for meth before you make your official determination?
you're looking for an overdose?
because I-I'm pretty certain it was the hole in her head that killed her.
I'd just like a little more time to figure out exactly how she got that hole to begin with, that's all.
you... stay.
chief, Mr. West has been read his rights, and he's dying to talk to you.
thank you, commander.
I can't believe she blew her brains out.
Oh, Mr. West, you don't want to look at that. Right this way.
that's just very upsetting.
detective?
it's a tragedy, man, but I guess Gina was going through some things.
shocker. This way.
just have a seat.
thank you.
so, uh, Mr. West, you were saying that Gina was going through a lot recently?
uh, yeah, yeah, stuff with her kid, you know?
her asshole ex-husband was suing for permanent custody,
uh, said that Gina wasn't fit to be a mom 'cause she was a-a druggie,
so the judge told her clean up or else.
and did she?
hell, yeah.
j-just got back from rehab last week.
Mr. West, earlier this evening, you told my detectives that you were out with a friend during the time of Gina's death.
is there someone we can talk to that can confirm that?
you... so you're still not buying the whole suicide angle?
we're exploring all possibilities, Mr. West.
okay, t-t-talk to my buddy Paul.
um... Paul...
I-I was with him until I called you guys.
I can... I can give you his number.
I didn't do this.
I-I loved Gina.
uh, y-y-you know what else?
you know, now... now that I think of it, You... you should talk to, um, her ex-husband, too.
t-the last thing that dude wanted was for her to get visitation ever again,
let alone custody to their daughter, you know?
I mean, that's what you're looking for, right...
motive?
I mean, I didn't have any motive, you know?
and why would I leave her body outside of our place?
I mean, if it were me, I would take it out to the desert, pour some gravy on it, let the coyotes do the rest.
you know, that way... poof! You know?
just gone.
uh, sounds like you got your plan all figured out.
no, I think things through.
I can see that. Yes.
uh, so, uh, this... t-that cop told me that I-I had the right to remain silent.
so... so, when does that start?
Oh, any time now.
you also have the right to an attorney, because you are under arrest.
what? Why?
for possession of methamphetamine.
sleep tight, Mr. West. Detective, would you?
Oh, come on.
put your hands behind your back, please.
gentle.
just don't get junkie on me, okay?
come on, man. - This is a new suit.
morning, chief Johnson.
everything all right?
just missing the old building.
Yeah, parking three blocks away does take some getting used to.
Oh, man.
pretty exciting about Pope, don't you think?
I mean, he is the closest thing to a lock for chief of police I can think of.
Oh, I don't know.
the commission has a lot of candidates they're considering.
it's Pope.
trust me.
and you know what that means?
what? - Musical chairs.
everybody changes jobs.
in fact, you could become the new assistant chief, especially with l.A.P. D.'s emphasis on diversity.
Pope's number two... That would be a nice position for you.
would it?
and should you be promoted... I would be honored to take over major crimes.
that would be... that would be something... to... to consider.
I had been, um, thinking about who would replace me If I were to become unavailable.
the more seamless we... we make the transitions, the better.
I mean, who's closer to major crimes than me?
excuse me.
well, thank you, commander, for thinking ahead.
uh, yes, lieutenant? What is it?
Yeah, chief. I got an address on the victim's ex-husband.
I can send Gabriel down if you want.
Oh, yes, tell the Detective I'll be right...
for starters, you got three lieutenants in your squad.
promote one of them.
actually, no.
lieutenant, I'd like you to join me for this notification.
I'll meet you at your car, okay?
sure.
you know, as assistant chief, you get your own parking space right here in the building.
come on, my sweet.
Oh, but I'm gonna take you to the toy store again... Now?
against my better judgment.
Yes.
excuse me, ma'am.
I'm lieutenant Flynn.
this is deputy chief Johnson from the l.A.P. D. is Darren Tatem here?
in you go, my girl.
my dad's making his music.
when I dance to it, he cracks up.
you must have some great moves.
what's your name?
may I ask what this is regarding?
Yes. We have some information for Mr.Tatem, ma'am.
well, his doctor wants him to take it easy, but I suppose a few minutes wouldn't hurt, huh?
he's just down the hall.
is he sick?
um, you could say that. Yes.
daddy. Daddy, police officers.
Hello, Mr.Tatem. I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the l.A.P.D. and this is lieutenant Flynn.
we're so sorry to bother you this morning.
we were hoping you could answer a few of our questions.
sure, I guess. - Anything I can get you?
uh, I'm fine, mom. Thanks.
now you go with grandma, okay?
okay.
come on, my sweet girl.
Bye, daddy. - Bye.
lymphoma.
mom and dad help me fight the good fight.
you play beautifully. - Thank you.
it's part of a score I'm rushing to finish.
you do all your work here?
Yeah. I don't get out much right now.
I imagine these are not the questions that you came here to ask.
how are things between you and your ex-wife, Mr.Tatem?
strained. Why?
when was the last time you saw her?
I don't know. About a week ago, when she got out of rehab.
Why? What happened?
well, I'm afraid we have some bad news for you and your daughter, Mr.Tatem.
Gina was found dead last night.
and the bad news is?
sorry.
it's just a lot of water under the bridge. Did she O.D?
Yeah. On lead.
your ex-wife died of a gunshot wound to the head.
she shot herself?- That's unclear a-at this point.
but, um, to your knowledge, did your ex-wife, Gina, own a gun like this one, perhaps?
um, no, not... not that I ever knew of.
sir?
if... if you're here wondering whether I shot her, the answer is no.
like I said, I-I don't get out much lately.
Gina's boyfriend, Mr. West, told us that there were some custody issues that you and your ex-wife were dealing with.
I just wanted her to get clean, that's all.
now, I had the courts force her into rehab in order to give Cody the best possible chance at a...
at a healthy home.
I mean, I-I even gave Gina $25, 000 when she got out just to get her back on her feet again.
I'm just... I'm t-trying to make the best of a-a truly t-terrible situation, you know?
for Cody.
when did you say you gave your ex-wife this $25, 000?
Gabrcount.
but, uh, if you look here, boyfriend Wayne West...
it says he deposited $25, 000 into his bank account four days ago.
two days after Gina got out of rehab.
detective Sanchez, where are we on Wayne West's alibi?
detective Sanchez, have you been able to confirm Mr. West's alibi at the time of the shooting?
Oh, right, chief.
um, I-I called the number he gave us.
this guy, Paul Olson... I had to leave a message, and Olson hasn't called me back yet.
have you tried paying him a visit?
not yet, chief. No.
well, is that something that you could possibly do?
say, now?
chief. Chief.
uh, clearly Wayne West stole money from Gina.
but he owned the car she died in.
he reported her dead. He went off and took a shower and cleaned himself up.
and then he fled the scene.
what are we waiting on Sanchez for?
all right, lieutenant. You want another crack at Mr.West yourself?
tell us about the money.
Oh, man.
okay. This looks bad, I know.
but, um, did you talk to my friend?
because I-I was with him.
well, your friend is avoiding us.
what?
okay. Look. Gina's ex gave me that money.
Really? Because he told us he gave it to her.
no. No way! No!
okay, okay.
uh, he gave me that money 'cause he wanted me to convince Gina to sign away her parental rights, okay?
that... that... that's the truth.
did he also want you to put a bullet in her skull?
man, please. He... he was her ex.
Mr.Tatem is probably dying, Mr.West.
I don't think sole custody was an issue for him anymore.
look, I know, okay? But... but he's loaded, okay?
so... so I guess the thing is, when he kicks it, all that money goes into a trust for the girl,
a trust that Gina would control unless someone, I.E. Me, could convince her to sign away her rights.
well, did you convince her like tatem paid you to?
I w...
you know, it... it was never the right moment, so...
Mr. West, you had far more to gain if Gina got custody of her daughter.
and yet you want us to believe that you agreed to sell yourself short for $25, 000?
you know, who's to say she wouldn't skip on me as soon as things went her way?
besides, you think... You think I want that whiny little brat around?
no, man, just give me the $25, 000 up front.
least I know what's in it for me, you know?
uh, chief, can I talk to you two for a second?
Yes, Detective.
just a moment, mr. West.
I didn't do it!
Darren Tatem just wired another $25, 000 into Wayne's account.
this is beginning to look less and less like a suicide.
and more like a murder for hire.
Yeah. - More?
uh, yeah, a little bit more.
okay. Chief, I'm sorry.
my mother had to go to work, and my sister's sick, and he had no other place...
have you found Mr. West's alibi yet?
not yet, no. But...
detective, you are holding up my investigation.
chief, I went by Olson's apartment. A neighbor there said he skipped to Vegas.
and I have the police there looking for him.
but I have no other way to verify West's alibi.
chief, good news... Sanchez found someone else who can verify Wayne West's alibi.
detective, a choice needs to be made regarding your situation.
and lieutenant provenza is going to help you make it.
lieutenant, with me. With me.
chief, I'm sorry.
he's just new to this whole taking-care-of-kids thing, and I was just trying to help out.
then stop covering for him.
tell me about this new alibi.
we were going through Tatem's accounts, and found a series of payments he recently made to a private investigator.
Gabriel's bringing the guy in right now.
good.
here. Let me get the door for you.
thank you.
west didn't kill anyone.
I was following him the whole night. Got it all written down right here.
may I?
you were hired by Mr. Tatem. Is that correct?
Yeah. There were some custody issues, and Tatem wanted me to find out if his ex-wife was still on drugs.
tore him up thinking she was gonna raise their little girl.
I...I felt for the guy.
okay. Here we go.
thursday night, 6:27 P. M. West is picked up by a friend.
Gina remains at the apartment?
Yeah. That's why I stayed on West. I figured I'd see if he was buying for her.
was he?
couldn't prove it. But he was definitely using, though.
and he scored some meth that night with his friend.
i-it says here West got home at 10: 15 P. M.
right, when he discovered her body.
he freaked and called 911 on his cell, and I left, got some sleep.
sorry.
how often were you reporting to Mr.Tatem?
every day at some point. - By phone?
mostly.
he came by the office a few times when he was feeling up to it.
so he's still able to get around.
a-and that night, the... the night that Gina died... Did you talk to him then?
I did. I told him West was getting high.
so Mr.Tatem knew Gina was by herself.
coroner's investigator said she was dead by 10 P.M.
but why would he pay me to prove his ex-wife was still using if he was just gonna kill her anyway?
I promise that is the first question I'm gonna ask him.
sir, we're here to speak with Darren Tatem.
he's busy, so unless you have a warrant, I... - If you'll excuse us.
lieutenant Tao, upstairs, please.
lieutenant Provenza.
sir, is Mr.Tatem in his recording studio?
I'll take that as a yes.
and his daughter... is she here, too?
Cody went shopping with my wife.
look, showing up with all these people here Is completely unnecessary.
Darren will cooperate in any way he can.
good. Detective.
he's very sick. Don't you understand that?
look, he hasn't done anything wrong!
why don't you just tell me what you want?!
Mr.Tatem.
my son didn't do anything!
Mr.Tatem. Mr.Tatem, open this door!
wait! Wait!
Darren, please! - Sir... sir...
sir, just stay back, okay?
Mr.Tatem, we need to talk to you.
open this door now.
please, let me go in. - Sir, I said stay back!
this is ridiculous! - Stay back!
you want it open? - Yes.
Mr.Tatem, we know you hired a private investigator.
he told you that Gina was by herself.
just leave him alone!
that woman shot herself! - Sir, will you shut up?!
we know Wayne West didn't kill her.
you just transferred another $25, 000 to frame him.
please leave my family alone.
no. - Could you please just leave them alone?
that's up to you, Mr.Tatem. Open this door.
we need to talk to you.
dad, I love you.
hurry, Detective. - I'm trying.
and I love mom, too, okay? And tell Cody.
tell her that she was everything to me. Never doubt it.
open the door. Get it open now. - I'm trying, chief.
Darren! Darren! No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
chief, you all right?
4-King-62. 4-King-62.
I have a gunshot wound. - Oh, Darren, what did you do?
male, 30s. I need paramedics, two additional units, and a supervisor now... do you copy?
Darren, what did you do? What did you do? - All units, 4-king-62 is requesting Two units and a supervisor.
look at this.
I killed her. For Cody. I'm sorry.
now, this was definitely a suicide.
no argument here.
you know, when people shoot themselves in the mouth like this,
they always press their tongue against the barrel at the moment of truth.
interesting, no?
how sick was he?
well, about as sick as you can be.
uh, the cancer was everywhere.
he had a few weeks left, Max.
would he have known that for sure?
no responsible physician would have told him anything else.
so why not just... Turn himself in?
I don't know. In his condition, the judge probably grants bail.
he spends whatever time he has left at home.
with his daughter. - And his morphine drip.
but to each his own.
let's just go back over everything, j-just to be safe.
the... the timeline, the finances.
just recheck everyone's story.
thank you so much, doctor.
the tox results for Gina Decker.
even though I'm still pretty certain It was the bullet that killed her,
she was pretty jacked up on meth at the time of death.
so she would've lost custody regardless.
if Tatem had only known.
that's what bothers me.
he did know. I-I mean, he had to.
his P.I.Told him Wayne West was using.
wait a minute. I'm sorry. Are you questioning the confession now?
you mean the seven words he typed on his computer?
just because he didn't say them to your face doesn't make it any less real.
anyway, uh... Speaking of custody issues, I've been thinking.
if I make chief, I might move you into my job...
in which case, we would need to begin to consider who might take over your division.
uh, okay, yes.
um, I-I'll start thinking about that.
how do I look? Seriously?
fine. Nice.
where are you going, anyway?
this event/dinner thing with a bunch of, uh, city council members.
you don't know how lucky you are you don't have to do this stuff.
what about Taylor?
what about him?
you know, for major crimes.
well, think about it. He's... he's been very supportive.
so send him a basket of muffins.
have a nice dinner.
you're talking in the realm of ifs and maybes, and I'm talking in the realm of facts.
I don't believe this. - It's not as simple as you're making it out to be.
it's not that simple. Over here?
lieutenant! You need to handle this.
chief, this isn't about Sanchez.
Gabriel, come on.
what's it about? - Nothing, chief.
E-everything's fine. Nothing.
Tatem did not kill his ex-wife.
why do you say that?
cause we were going back through everything.
and lieutenant tao and I took a look at Tatem's computer.
we were looking at the score that he was finishing up.
lieutenant, the score?
the program he works on... Is automatically set up to save changes every five minutes.
could you open the list of changes, please, lieutenant?
Oh, boy. Here we go.
right. Okay.
if you'll notice the dates and times of these saves,
you'll see they occurred during the evening of Gina's murder, starting at 6: 00 P. M. and continuing past 11: 00.
but that doesn't mean he was actually there.
you said the program saves automatically.
only if changes are made.
so he had to have been working on the score during that time, or it wouldn't have changed anything.
exactly.
chief, please.
chief, we've already solved this case once.
it's wrapped up with a bow on top.
now, if you untie that bow, you know what will happen.
this isn't the kind of decision we make on our own.
detective Gabriel, Since this is still a custody case, I'd like to see Cody Tatem.
have her grandparents bring her in, please. Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
we'll, uh, head down here.
sorry for the inconvenience.
thank you, commander.
Oh, no job too small.
Mr. and Mrs.Tatem, thank you so much for coming down here tonight.
right this way.
seems like we're running our own little daycare here lately.
um, Detective Sanchez here would be happy to watch Cody While we talk, if you don't mind.
Cody, okay?
okay, sweetie.
lieutenant Flynn.
come on, sweetheart.
excuse me. Excuse me.
yes? - You said that you had some questions about Darren's death?
Yes. I have what I hope will be comforting news for you both.
and that is that we've been able to establish that your son was not responsible for the death of Gina Decker.
what?
I'm sorry. I fail to see how that's comforting news to us,
considering that it was your investigation that forced Darren to commit suicide!
sir. Our investigation did not force him to confess.
which of you was he trying to protect by killing himself?
what are you talking about?
no one. That's... that's ridiculous!
we're... we're... we're not answering anything else.
you will if you want to retain custody of your granddaughter.
what?
you wouldn't dare try to keep her here.
I've done worse things.
I'm beginning to think that you have, too.
let's find out.
you first.
Albert. - Sir.
sir, I need you to come with me down the hall, please.
uh, it'll just be a few minutes.
all right, now, Mrs. Tatem, I've gone around and around on this case, and, frankly, I'm tired of being lied to.
so I'm gonna make this very simple.
detective Gabriel here has read you your rights.
first I'm gonna talk to you, and then I'm gonna talk to your husband.
and if I believe that the two of you conspired to kill your ex-daughter-in-law...
no. Wait. That never happened.
...then little Cody, who's already lost her mother and her father, will also lose you when the department of children's services puts her into foster care.
Oh, God, no. Please, please, please... - However, if I believe that one of you acted on your own,
then the remaining grandparent will be awarded full custody and be able to take Cody home tonight.
are we done yet?
Mrs. Tatem.
Darren was our only child.
and when it became clear that he wasn't going to beat the cancer,
the only thing we had to hold on to was that he would live on with us through Cody.
and Thursday morning, when Darren told us that Gina had tested clean and...
after he was gone we were g-going to lose Cody, too...
had you tried to arrange it so that you and your husband would retain custody of your granddaughter?
of course!
we hired lawyers.
but in California, when the mother is deemed fit...
the grandparents have no custodial rights.
let's get to Thursday night, shall we?
my husband... He called Gina... And told her he wanted to meet
and that there would be a lot of money in it for her if she would just sign away her parental rights.
but she... she refused to meet Albert.
so I went instead.
wait. You did?
I brought our checkbook, hoping I could pay her enough money to get her to sign the papers.
and you also brought a gun?
Yes. I did.
Mrs. Tatem, let me warn you that if your story does not match your husband's, - I'll be forced to think that the two of you planned it together. - My husband didn't do it.
no. Listen to me. I did it. I did it.
tell me how you planned it.
I didn't plan it.
I just knew it had to be done.
Gina was surprised to see me.
but I told her I just wanted to talk.
she was hungry, so I offered to buy her dinner.
I was low on gas, and Gina's license had been revoked, so we got in Wayne's car.
but before we drove away,
I-I asked Gina where she was comfortable going, considering how she was dressed.
and she... she took that entirely the wrong way.
she ended up screaming at me.
that's when she said that after Darren died, we would never see Cody again.
there was nothing left to discuss.
I got out of the car.
she was so mad, she wouldn't even look at me.
I reached into my purse for the gun.
I leaned into the car.
and I shot her in the head.
Where'd you get the gun?
it was Darren's.
I'd hidden it from him.
afraid he might do something stupid.
I guess he replaced it.
did he know you killed Gina?
not until you showed him a picture of his gun.
and what about your husband?
he doesn't know anything.
I decided to let Darren go...
with the knowledge that Cody would be safe.
but you took away all the time Darren had left... with Cody, with your husband, with you.
your son killed himself to protect you.
and worst of all, Mrs. Tatem, blood work from our morgue shows that Gina was still using.
so she would have lost custody anyway.
you only know that because I put a bullet in her brain.
and what would have happened to Cody if I hadn't?
we all know.
don't we?
I had to do it.
I had to.
I'm gonna bring your husband in now so you can tell him yourself what you did.
good luck to you, Mrs. Tatem.
bringing the husband in now, chief. - Thank you.
chief, you know, we could write this up as manslaughter.
she brought a gun with her, lieutenant.
and good intentions.
is this how you want custody battles decided... By knocking off everyone unqualified to be a parent?
we'd have a world full of orphans.
write it up as a murder.
we'll let the jury decide.
Yeah, chief.
do you want me to turn this off, chief?
uh, no. Can I borrow headphones, please? - Sure.
you sure she's not lying to you?
I am now.
rough day?
you could say that.
Thanks.
you decide to turn in your application for chief or not?
no... Because the only person in my division who's begun to share my priorities is Gabriel,
and he'd never even be considered because of his rank.
and maybe his record.
you know, Pope went outside the department to find you.
you could do the same.
of course, you'd have to be chief to do it.
I don't know.
we'll see.
maybe you're right. Maybe...
getting a little emotional distance wouldn't be such a terrible thing.
so, it's my first death notification And I'm a little nervous.
sorry about what happened to your grandpa, here's my card," You know, blah, blah, blah.
anyway, I'm about halfway out the door When my partner, Ray, says to me, "hey, knucklehead, before they show up to see the body,
you maybe want to go inside and tell the family That grandpa is missing his head!
the grandfather had... No head!
so, I'm sure you two don't date All of your first-class passengers.
Oh, no, no. Just the cute ones.
are you, uh, enjoying your drive?
because if you're tired... - Oh, not at all, darlin'.
I could go all night.
your destination is ahead.
the skies look very friendly.
you got everything you need?
my friend Ryan's in the guest room.
do you know how to be quiet? - I think so.
well, that's too bad. 'Cause I only know how to be loud.
Oh, God.
Whoa! I love the bovine motif.
do you? - Yeah!
I think I may have been a cow in another life.
Hey, how 'bout a little "moo-sage"?
there's baby oil in the bathroom.
20 minutes. 20 minutes.
baby oil. Baby oil.
15 minutes. 15 minutes.
Hey, Mr. Policeman...
what do you think about these?
how would you feel about a real pair?
what? - Your friend Ryan...
is he about 6 feet tall?
lots of tattoos? Not so talkative?
Why?
Oh, my God! Who is that?
you really don't know him? - No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
hmm, 93 degrees.
so, uh, there's no sign of forced entry,
suggesting that our missing flight attendant, Ryan Wade,
either opened the door for the victim Or he possibly picked him up, brought him home for a hook-up.
Really? People still pick up strangers for sex In this day and age?
all right. Ma'am...
was your friend Ryan the sort to bring home Someone like the man lying dead in the bathtub?
I don't know.
I mean, I can't say.
which is it...you don't know or you can't say?
I barely know Ryan.
but if I ever thought he'd bring a man like that home,
I never would have given him the key.
lieutenant, rather than just sit here,
why don't you get up and join the investigation?
you know, chief, I-I don't think Standing up is such a good idea right now.
chief, the victim's got no I.D.
coroner's investigator says he's almost full lividity,
liver temperature's 93 degrees, Placing time of death around 9: 00 P.M.
that's good news. - Why?
the girls came back here after our flight, But by 8: 00 P. M. we were all out having dinner At Musso and Frank's.
Yes, lieutenant, it's always good news
when suspects in a homicide Can point to us for their alibi.
also, chief, I think our killer Left big, stubby fingerprints practically everywhere.
well, um, some of those fingerprints Might be...
mine.
two hands on the sink?
palm on the mirror? Not the murder weapon?!
Yes, tao, yes!
all right?! Look, at first, I didn't know I was in a crime scene,
and I-I didn't clean up after myself because I didn't want to run the risk of wiping away the killer's prints.
my actions throughout Have been as highly professional as always.
chief.
do you want me to book these into evidence?
no.
I'll run everything, including our Juan Doe's prints, Through AFIS.
just to be clear...We're calling this a major crime because...
look, whenever a member of my division stumbles on a body,
it is automatically a major crime.
all right, uh, Detective Gabriel, With me, please, to the morgue.
and lieutenants Flynn and provenza, Let's take our suspects downtown,
read them their rights, and try to keep them happy and talking.
easy enough, chief. We were keeping them happy and talking before.
Ashley believes That she might have been a cow in a previous life.
can you stand up yet?
give me five minutes, would ya?
fine, but according to the ad, Pretty soon you're gonna have to call a doctor.
the second cervical vertebrae is shattered,
which would have caused paralysis of the diaphragm And instant suffocation.
wait, wait, are you saying the killer broke this guy's neck With a baseball bat?
uh, doubtful.
I mean, an athlete with your physique Could have done that,
but from what I can see, The person you're looking for
wasn't picked first in gym class.
I count 83 bruises...
Hello? Gabriel here.
suggesting the assailant closed their eyes And swung randomly.
looks to me like Juan broke his neck When he tripped in the tub.
frankly, I'm not even sure I would call this a murder.
seems to me more like, uh...
an accidental death In the middle of someone else's hissy fit.
okay. I will let her know.
chief, AFIS identified our victim...Jose Coto.
he's got numerous arrests for narcotics
and connections to a local up-and-coming drug ring.
thank you, Detective. So the baseball bat didn't kill him?
no, though it probably really annoyed him As he was dying from a broken neck.
anyway, his name was Raj,
and we knew he was about to drop dead 'cause he weighed about 900 pounds!
so, how does a criminal with a drug history
end up dead in the bathroom of a stewardess's condo?
uh, I think they're called Flight attendants now, chief.
Really?
we searched Ashley's condo.
no drugs or cash, But we found the missing flight attendant,
uh, Ryan Wade's, cellphone.
and it was on... and no incoming calls.
okay, I'd like the apartment gone over again, please, This time by drug dogs.
detective Gabriel? - Uh, yes, uh, chief.
Wade made about, uh, $30, 000 last year... Most of it from colonial airlines.
and I sent no signs of money trouble.
and what about the women? - Well, I,uh...
haven't done their financials yet,
but, um, neither one of them have criminal records.
thank you. So much.
I mean, I know what a casket's supposed to weigh, And this was really heavy.
now, how we all doin'?
we're tired, and y'all are treating us Like we had something to do with whatever happened To that horrible "bang-ganger.
for all we know, your acquaintance Ryan Wade
is out on some kind of murderous rampage.
what if we sent you home and he killed you, too?
how would that make us look?
maybe somebody kidnapped Ryan.
now, who would do that?
well, obviously you don't watch the news 'cause if you did, You would know that there are all kinds of people
doing all sorts of terrible things For no reason whatsoever.
that's true.
Yeah. - Yeah.
you know, this is what I get for being nice.
I know!
the only reason I even offered Ryan my guest room
was so he didn't have to spend the night in that awful trailer.
Oh God.
what trailer?
flight crews don't get layovers In fancy motels anymore.
in between trips, nearly everyone has to stay here.
remember that emergency landing on Puget sound About five years back...
the hero pilot? - Captain don Ellis.
retired air force lieutenant.
he lives here now? - Yeah, 10 days a month.
you can't beat the price. And if you ever need to take a shower,
you can always use the 24-hour fitness around the corner.
good morning, Margie!
you on a first-name basis with everybody around here?
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm kind of the unofficial "mayor" of lot b.
uh, this is the one you're looking for.
this is where Ryan Wade would be staying.
Yeah.
L.A.P.D.
we've got a warrant. Go for it.
chief!
we've found our missing flight attendant.
ginger thinks drugs were here.
I'm guessing whoever shot him didn't need a silencer!
to be fair, commander, Your new office isn't really a cubicle.
it's more like a... Super cubicle.
it has no door.
well, as you know, many layoffs are coming,
and hopefully when space opens up,
we can find you an office more to your liking.
thank you, chief.
30 years on the force, And I get a cubicle.
a cubicle!
more complaints about the building?
and how can I help you?
major crimes has begun a murder investigation That appears drug-related.
we could really use some help. - Can't do it.
ever since we started asking for full financial disclosure From our narcotics detectives, they've all transferred...One of the many things I'll fix when I'm chief.
what's your case about, anyway?
well, before you get angry, Uh, last night, lieutenants Lynn and Provenza...
Yeah, already angry.
what have they done this time?
while escorting a fugitive back from Dallas,
they struck up a date with a couple of stewardesses.
what is this, the '70s?
and, in accompanying his date back to her condo,
lieutenant provenza found the body Of a known drug trafficker in the bathroom.
another colleague staying there was missing But has since turned up.
okay, well, that's good. - Only he turned up dead...
in a trailer...Where drugs had been present but couldn't be found.
okay, so we have missing drugs and two dead bodies.
any suspects? - Only the women...
who were with lieutenants Flynn and Provenza During the time of the first death.
Flynn and Provenza.
do you have any idea how difficult it is To explain this kind of behavior when you're applying to be chief of police?
I might.
what does that mean?
I've been drafted to apply for the chief's position. Believe me, it wasn't my idea.
drafted...
who exactly drafted you?
the l.A.P.D.Women's coordinator, Captain Raydor.
she was concerned that other female officers From within the department weren't applying.
I need a day to think about this.
what?
I said I need a day to think about this!
considering that I hired you, I brought you here,
and I've backed you up in every confrontation You've provoked over the last five years,
I don't think that's much to ask. Do you?
fine. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
uh, what about my request for narcots officers?
denied.
fine. We'll do what we can.
I certainly hope My inability to conduct this investigation properly Doesn't end up reflecting poorly on you.
chief, I need to talk to you about this cubicle business.
I'll be happy to discuss your workspace with you, commander,
just as soon as I sort out my double homicide. Thanks for understanding.
buzz, have our guests said anything I should care about?
do you have any interest in bronzer, lip gloss, or waxing?
uh, Detective Gabriel, Anything from the canine unit at the condo?
uh, yes...just like in the trailer, the dogs went crazy.
and just like in the trailer, no narcotics were found.
chief, I've gone over all the flight logs From all the trips that Ashley and Linda Worked on during the past two years.
it looks like they flew with Ryan Wade over 90 times.
so much for your girlfriend Barely knowing her dead houseguest.
chief, just because they worked together Doesn't mean that they knew each other.
uh, I mean, y-y-you think I have a clue as to what Buzz does off the clock?
something else, chief.
the morgue went through our dead flight attendant's pockets
and found his key to the trailer.
given that the killer locked the door behind them...
they must have had their own key. Thank you, Detective.
Hey, chief...Jose Coto, the dead guy at the condo?
turns out the feds had a flag on him.
we traded calls with the bureau,
and there's an Agent who would like a word with you.
just one second.
look, no matter what, Ryan Wade didn't shoot himself,
so there's still at least one killer outstanding.
and I want to know everything that those women know.
but, chief, l-look, I-I'm as anxious to close this as you are.
but Ashley and Linda...
these are very respectable ladies.
Flynn, back me up here. - Sure thing.
chief, did we meet these girls yesterday? Absolutely.
do we know them well? I mean, hardly.
I mean, would I stake my reputation on their being on the up-and-up?
no. Is it possible that they... - Way to back me up, Flynn!
and this dead Ryan guy...I mean, he could be mixed up with anybody.
lieutenant, has it even occurred to you
th these women just asked y'all out 'cause they were using you?
What?! That's crazy!
I won't even dignify that with a response!
I know what's what.
and these girls are crazy about us!
is that so hard to believe?
I'm so sorry. I've been running all over,
and I should have called to say that this murder, Which is actually now two murders,
is taking a lot longer than I expected.
Oh, you've only just begun.
meet Miguel Diaz... From Honduras.
he owns a freight business here, Which we suspected was enabling a growing drug operation.
jose Coto...The guy you found last night, also from Honduras...
was one of Diaz's drivers.
now, he shows up dead in a flight attendant's condo,
and suddenly it all makes sense.
Diaz's freight business is a front.
lets him launder money While serving as a decoy for the drug smuggling,
which we now believe is handled by airline personnel.
well, as of today, Diaz has one less operative working for him.
and I got two more down the hall I think are ready to spill.
I'll let you know what I find out.
actually...
honey...
I've been sent here...
to wheedle my way into your investigation.
this is me wheedling.
well, we are shorthanded when it comes to narcotics, but...
would you be helping me solve my case Or would I be helping you solve yours?
is it impossible to think That we could work this out happily together?
probably.
but I'm willing to try. - Oh, well, that's great news.
now, if you really think these two women are involved,
I don't see any rush to break them.
if we hold onto them for a day...
are you asking me to wait a day?
is that a problem? - Yes, it is.
I have a better idea.
we've got orange juice, coffee, sprite.
uh, do you have diet coke? - Uh, will diet Pepsi do?
have they gotten anything out of the girls yet?
no, but the girls have gotten plenty out of them.
Oh, chief, we'll clear this stuff away for you.
uh, actually, lieutenant, I'd appreciate it if y'all would just get out.
get out, get out, get out! Thank you. So much.
well, let me start by saying that my officers Have made some surprising discoveries.
Ashley, you may be amazed to learn That there were drugs in your apartment.
drugs?
y-you mean like drug drugs?
how would drugs get into Ashley's condo?
you think just like a Detective, Linda.
well, I don't know, but I suppose That Ryan could have carried drugs off the plane
and into the condo, taking them with him After killing the man in the bathtub.
does that sound even remotely possible to you?
can I be totally honest with you? - I'd love for you to try.
I don't know Ryan that well.
but I have always been suspicious That he might be some kind of drug mule.
now, why would you let a drug mule Stay in your condo?
well...
he has other positive qualities.
he's really good with the silverware.
and the trash. He keeps the galley spotless.
Mm-hmm, and he's a very reliable phone-message taker.
you mean he was a reliable phone-message taker.
just look at the damn screens, Hmm?
you see, when we went to that awful trailer this morning, We found Ryan.
but he was, unfortunately, dead.
Ryan's dead?
shot four times. Twice in the head.
now, I'm sure if y'all had known Ryan well
that would have made more of an impact, But, still, it must be a little upsetting.
I wonder who might have killed Ryan.
always thinking like a Detective, Aren't you, Linda? Who knows?
as you've seen on the news, The world is a horrible place,
specially for people Who are involved in drug drugs Like Ryan seems to have been.
the way...Have either of you young ladies ever seen th man before?
his name is Miguel Diaz.
he's involved with drugs, money laundering, and worse.
no. - No.
no? - No.
sorry. - Well, that's wonderful.
and since y'all don't know anything at all...
and since there's nothing connecting you To whoever shot Ryan Wade at point-blank range,
y'all are free to go.
wait, wait.
I mean, shouldn't we be protected?
from what?
from the unknown.
from, uh... From whoever killed Ryan.
Oh, people tangled up in drug-mule stuff Like Ryan seems to have been...
those people...They always get what they have coming to them.
you two, on the other hand, should be just fine.
all right. - Well, good luck.
perhaps lieutenants Flynn and Provenza will see you out.
thank you. Thank you so much.
chief! Chief, y-y-you're not gonna make those girls Walk out of here to face god-knows-what.
no, you and lieutenant Flynn Are gonna invite them over to your house.
buzz? I'll get his place wired right away, chief.
as many cameras as you can hide.
consider this your chance To prove that these women weren't just using you.
and if they were? - Use them back.
the only thing I would like about Is there's not enough good Chinese take-out.
well, maybe there aren't enough Jews.
uh, my experience has been That the more Jews, the better the Chinese food.
well, it goes back to Moses, who said, "with ten commandments, you get egg rolls.
I don't get it. - No one ever does.
okay. Here we go.
it's so wonderful of you and Andy to let us stay here tonight.
are you sure if your boss finds out Y'all won't get into any trouble?
not a chance.
when he and I are off the clock, Nobody tells us what to do.
would you go easy on me If you knew I smuggled something off the plane?
tiny wine, anybody?
it goes great with take-out.
none for me, but you go ahead. You scared me there for a second.
so, what's t deal with your boss?
uh, how do you mean exactly?
well, it's like she thinks She's too good for the beauty pageant.
I mean, believe me, being from the South, I know her type.
like when she says, "thank you,
what she's really saying is..."you know where you can stick that!
you know, some women, they just...
they hit that glass ceiling, you know, And they just get so bitter.
dumplings, anyone? Now, these are delicious!
don't pay attention to them.
Oh, please, honestly...do you think I care What a couple of stewardesses say about me?
uh, I think they're called flight attendants now, chief.
we'll get to see how good they look in orange jumpsuits.
excuse me.
Hello?
lieutenant, let's not forget we're here to do something
and that someday this may all get played in court.
no habla espagnol.
Oh, you speak Spanish?
Ah, here we go, oh, beautiful one.
the last sip.
for you.
Oh. Thank you.
it feels so safe being here with you two.
Andy, after you find the person who killed Ryan,
will we still have anything to worry about?
who's to say?
as it is, I don't have a clue Why someone would have killed Ryan in the first place.
do you think that it's possible That we could talk to each other like...
like we're regular people? - Yeah.
I mean, could we just take off our uniforms a minute And trust each other?
girls, listen.
Flynn and I work murders. If this is about...
I don't know...drugs maybe, Believe me, we don't give a damn about that.
well, that guy who you found dead in the tub...
maybe we did know him a little.
how little?
a few years ago, our airline Added a flight from Honduras.
the coffee we brew on the plane comes in sealed bags.
regular has a green dot, decaf has a yellow dot,
and the bags they stocked in Honduras with cocaine Had a white dot.
we just had to make sure That we didn't accidentally open the wrong bag.
after we'd land, we'd take all the white-dot bags
and put them in a big, black trash bag, And we were done.
jose, the guy in my bathtub, Later on, he'd come by with cash.
well, how often was this?
once a month.
then once a week.
then every L.A.Flight connecting from Honduras.
only, over time, the drug people Gave us less and less for doing the exact same thing!
I mean, they said it was the recession, but...
I mean, I don't know.
a girl's got to live, so this week we decided To do something we've never done before.
ever since the airline stopped giving us meals,
we've put our food in little cooler bags.
and yesterday Ryan took all the white-dot packets
and carried it in his bag off the plane for us.
Ryan was supposed to hold onto the drugs
until we could sell them to this contact I made.
only I guess things got complicated for Ryan While we were at dinner.
but you don't have any idea who might have shot him?
no, we only ever dealt with Jose.
nobody else was involved in this?
besides the people in Honduras Who we didn't really know, no.
it was just us.
what we did really isn't that bad, is it?
I mean, Kelly our friend Who washes hair in a hair salon,
she doesn't declare any of her tips.
that is not legal.
chief, you get the sense There's a hole in this story?
big enough to fly a plane through.
we are close to a direct connection With Miguel Diaz, though.
and look at this.
whenever our flight attendants Were on a plane connecting from Honduras,
it was almost always with the same Captain...
a Captain mark Wheeler.
captain Wheeler, I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson From the L.A.P.D. major crimes.
and this is Agent fritz Howard from the FBI.
look, am I under arrest or am I just being questioned?
because your officer read me my rights And then walked off with all my belongings.
I apologize, sir. We ask people to empty their pockets
before interviews for our own security.
a-and you are welcome to leave, But we'd appreciate it if you'd answer a few questions first.
about? - Ryan Wade.
so he did call you guys, then.
he told he was gonna call us?
look, there's this, uh, trailer next to the airport Where some of us stay.
anyway, Ryan burst in on me And launched into this convoluted story
about drugs and smuggling and a guy who was dead.
and, honestly, I didn't know if he was for real
or if this was some sort of psychotic delusion.
so, what exactly did you say to Mr. Wade?
well, that he should go to the police.
did Mr. Wade have drugs with him When he arrived at the trailer?
no, no, he said that he had sold them to somebody else.
that's pretty much all I got from him before I took off.
and you left him in the trailer?
Ryan said he was convinced That these drug people were after him.
so I went to a hotel because, uh, He scared the crap out of me.
well, I'm sorry to inform you, sir,
that we found Ryan Wade yesterday, And he had been shot to death.
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea How Mr. Wade's killer might have found him?
you know, uh, Ryan came in a cab.
so perhaps they followed the cab to the parking lot.
there was no break-in, And the trailer door was locked when we discovered the body.
who else besides you and Mr. Wade have a key?
well, obviously, the owner. - And that would be?
it's one of the women we fly with...
ashely Rogers has two homes in LA. We found bodies in both of them.
Provenza sure can pick 'em.
chief, Wheeler said that Ryan arrived by taxi.
uh, but we checked, and none of the cab companies Had a pick-up during that time
going from Ashley's condo to the airport.
well, Ryan Wade didn't walk to that trailer. And I'm betting he didn't fly.
he may not have had to, chief.
Ashley Rogers has a car registered in Texas
that's been collecting parking tickets here in L.A.
it's not in the condo's garage. It's not on the surrounding streets.
I'm betting Wade took it.
so, Ashley didn't tell us about the car...
captain Wheeler lied to us About how Wade got to the trailer.
kind of makes you wonder what else those two aren't telling us.
well, I don't know, But I think starting a family argument might help us find out.
detective Sanchez, May I see Captain Wheeler's personal effects?
why didn't you tell us you had a car?
you never asked!
and I didn't know it was missing.
and Ryan knew I wasn't insured for an additional driver,
so if he took it without my permission, that's theft.
and if Captain Wheeler says that he didn't know about this,
well, then, he is the biggest lying liar ever.
he came to us with the idea.
I bet all that cocaine Ryan had is still in my car.
and somebody's got to get it Before the drug people come for us.
Ryan probably parked it in the personnel lot.
someone should check. We will, believe me.
uh, there's just one more thing I want to know.
and I want an honest answer.
did the two of you agree to go out with me and Flynn
because you thought we could keep you safe till you got rid of the drugs and left town?
well, not only.
but maybe mainly.
Yeah, this is Flynn. Get me the chief. Thanks.
so what you're saying is...
you were never really attracted to us.
not so much.
but I'm sure other women are.
like, if you ever came to Dallas, My mama would go out with you in a heartbeat.
Oh, mine too!
so, they say that the Captain was behind the whole thing.
thank you, lieutenant. Arrest them, refresh their memories about their rights,
and get them down here as quickly as possible.
you got it, chief. See you in about 20 minutes.
all right, you two, I want you to get your stuff. We're going downtown right now.
come on.
what?
are you upset about those two?
forget about them. They're criminals.
and they're not the only two flight attendants out there.
I think we just chose the wrong airline.
chief... I went through all the keys, and none are for the trailer.
thank you so much, Detective Sanchez.
so sorry to keep you in a holding pattern, Captain Wheeler.
seems we're always behind schedule around here. You know what that's like.
there's so much you can tell about a person from what they carry around in their pocket, Don't you think?
for example, looking at this, I'd think that you grew up on a farm...
or maybe you just have a thing for cheese.
am I close?
those aren't my car keys. - Aren't they?
Oh, w-who do they belong to?
the woman you implied earlier Was responsible for the murder of Ryan Wade? That Ashley?
Yes, that Ashley.
how is it that you have Ashley Rogers' car?
I borrowed it. - Oh, that's easy enough to confirm.
detective Gabriel, would you please get Ashley Rogers on the line?
uh, oh, no, okay, look. I didn't mention it before
because I didn't want to complicate things,
but I got Ashley's car from Ryan.
and that would complicate things how?
what, because if we would have known about the car,
we would have gone and looked for it And found the cooler full of narcotics inside
with your fingerprints on it?
mark Wheeler, you are under arrest For the murder of Ryan Wade.
let's go. - Wait a minute! I didn't kill Ryan!
Really? That's not how it looks to me.
and that's not how it's gonna look to a jury, either.
but, wait a minute... I-I-I'm telling you That...
that when I left... when I left that trailer, Ryan was fine.
Where's your key to the trailer?
what? - Your key.
you were in the trailer when Ryan got there, So you must have had a key.
where is it?!
do you have any idea what is going on out there?!
Mr. Wheeler!
it used to be when people saw me coming, That they would stand to attention.
I was... I was one notch below an astronaut.
now... I'm barely a bus driver.
I get it, Captain Wheeler. Your glory days are over.
who did you give the key to?
I'm arresting someone today for the murder of Ryan Wade.
it's either going to be you Or whoever you gave that key to!
I did not give that key to anyone.
I left that key outside the door... For Miguel Diaz.
and did you also leave the drugs for Mr. Diaz?
you know something? Ryan killed his guy with a bat!
do you think t-that returning the cocaine... That was gonna save his life?!
so you figured they were gonna kill him anyway,
so why not just take the dope and make the most of things?
where are the drugs now, Mr. Wheeler?
as far as I know, they're... they're in Ashley's car.
and where did you tell Mr. Diaz they were?
I told him that I didn't know...
that I'd look for them.
well, then...
you're gonna call Mr. Diaz.
you're gonna tell him you found them.
Hey!
Hey, let's pick it up in there, will ya?!
look, we'll go downtown and we'll sort this out.
Yeah.
Yeah, and everyone will see we're a couple of idiots.
it's had to know how we could look any stupider.
what the...
is that your car?!
Yeah. Yeah, but the joke's on them!
I'm nearly out of gas!
they're going to the airport personnel lot.
please tell me that you are not calling the chief.
I'm calling a cab.
detective Sanchez? - Ready, chief.
I can see Ashley's car. - Lieutenant tao?
all set, chief.
okay, just make the exchange... Drugs for the money and key...
and walk.
we've got you covered from all sides.
what in the hell?
Hey! Stop!
that's not yours!
keep going! Keep going! - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
we see you!
stop that cart!
police!
put your hands up!
get 'em up! Get 'em up!
this is not good.
go! Go!
chief, 9-mill.
you guys got all this under control?
Yes, lieutenant. Thank you so much.
good.
now where the hell is my car?!
Where's my car?!
Hey, you skanks! Bring me my car!
Buh-bye! Have a nice day, now!
Buh-bye! See ya again real soon!
thank you so much! - No, thank you!
Ah, that didn't work out so badly, did it?
closed two murder cases and broke a narcotics ring.
and spent more time together in the past two days Than all of last month.
happy happy. - Don't stay too late.
and good luck with pope, huh?
Oh, commander Taylor! I love what you've done with the space!
well, chief, you know, it may not look it, But...
but square-foot-wise, It... it's bigger than my old office.
do you have a minute?
Yeah, I've been meaning to find you, actually, To offer my congratulations.
thank you.
and to say I thought about what we discussed earlier,
and, uh, I think you should definitely Submit your application for chief of police.
I'm only sorry I didn't recognize that yesterday.
are you? - Yeah, it seems obvious now.
I mean, there should be a high-ranking female From within the department applying.
and, uh, if there's gonna be a woman in the candidate pool,
better it be you than somebody else.
a-a-and that's because?
well, your presence will help deter other women from applying.
and, you know, you'll be given "serious consideration,
but they'll never hire you as chief in a million years,
so, really, it's perfect for me.
is that so?
what makes you so certain I won't get it?
Brenda, please, you...
you can't even control your own officers.
and Flynn and Provenza were outwitted By a couple of stewardesses.
flight attendants. And they weren't outwitted.
Really? Where are they now?
you know, maybe if you hadn't called them A couple of skanks,
they would have told us where they parked your car.
I'm just saying. Do you think it's possible for you to shut up?!
look to the left. I'll look to the right.
Hey, I'm not the one who started talking to these two broads!
Oh, you're the one that picked them up on that plane!
Oh, no, I was not! - What, are you kidding me?
Oh, every woman you see, you got to go try to pick up!
so, it's my first death notification
and I'm a little nervous.
sorry about what happened to your grandpa, here's my card,
you know, blah, blah, blah.
anyway, I'm about halfway out the door When my partner, Ray, "hey, knucklehead, before they show up to see the body, "you maybe want to go inside and tell the family
that grandpa is missing his head!
the grandfather had...
no head!
so, I'm sure you two don't date
all of your first-class passengers.
Oh, no, no.
just the cute ones.
are you, uh, enjoying your drive?
because if you're tired...
Oh, not at all, darlin'. I could go all night.
your destination is ahead.
the skies look very friendly.
you got everything you need?
my friend Ryan's in the guest room.
do you know how to be quiet?
I think so.
well, that's too bad.
cause I only know how to be loud.
Oh, God.
I love the bovine motif.
do you? Yeah!
I think I may have been a cow in another life.
Hey, how 'bout a little "moo-sage"?
there's baby oil in the bathroom.
20 minutes.
20 minutes. Baby oil.
15 minutes.
15 minutes. Heh.
Hey, Mr. Policeman...
what do you think about these?
how would you feel about a real pair?
what?
your friend Ryan...
is he about 6 feet tall?
lots of tattoos? Not so talkative?
Why?
Oh, my God!
who is that?
you really don't know him?
No!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
hmm, 93 degrees.
so, uh, there's no sign of forced entry,
suggesting that our missing flight attendant, Ryan Wade,
either opened the door for the victim
or he possibly picked him up, brought him home for a hook-up.
Really?
people still pick up strangers for sex In this day and age?
all right. Ma'am...
was your friend Ryan the sort to bring home
someone like the man lying dead in the bathtub?
I don't know.
I mean, I can't say.
which is it... you don't know or you can't say?
I barely know Ryan.
but if I ever thought he'd bring a man like that home,
I never would have given him the key.
lieutenant, rather than just sit here,
why don't you get up and join the investigation?
you know, chief, I-I don't think Standing up is such
chief, the victim's got no I.D.
coroner's investigator says he's almost full lividity,
liver temperature's 93 degrees,
placing time of death around 9: 00 P.M.
that's good news.
Why?
the girls came back here after our flight,
but by 8: 00 P. M. we were all out having dinner At Musso and Frank's.
Yes, lieutenant, it's always good news
when suspects in a homicide Can point to us for their alibi.
also, chief, I think our killer Left big, stubby fingerprints practically everywhere.
well, um, some of those fingerprints
might be...
...Mine.
two hands on the sink?
palm on the mirror?
not the murder weapon?!
Yes, Tao, yes!
all right?!
look, at first, I didn't know I was in a crime scene,
and I-I didn't clean up after myself because
I didn't want to run the risk of wiping away the killer's prints.
my actions throughout Have been as highly professional as always.
chief.
do you want me to book these into evidence?
no.
I'll run everything, including our Juan Doe's prints, through AFIS.
just to be clear...
we're calling this a major crime because...
look, whenever a member of my division stumbles on a body,
it is automatically a major crime.
all right, uh, Detective Gabriel, With me, please, to the morgue.
and lieutenants Flynn and Provenza,
let's take our suspects downtown,
read them their rights, and try to keep them happy and talking.
easy enough, chief.
we were keeping them happy and talking before.
Ashley believes That she might have been a cow in a previous life.
can you stand up yet?
give me five minutes, would ya?
fine, but according to the ad, Pretty soon you're gonna have to call a doctor.
the second cervical vertebrae is shattered,
which would have caused paralysis of the diaphragm And instant suffocation.
wait, wait, are you saying the killer broke this guy's neck With a baseball bat?
uh, doubtful.
I mean, an athlete with your physique Could have done that,
but from what I can see,
the person you're looking for Wasn't picked first in gym class.
I count 83 bruises...
Hello? Gabriel here.
suggesting the assailant closed their eyes And swung randomly.
looks to me like Juan broke his neck When he tripped in the tub.
frankly, I'm not even sure I would call this a murder.
seems to me more like, uh...
an accidental death In the middle of someone else's hissy fit.
okay. I will let her know.
chief, AFIS identified our victim...
he's got numerous arrests for narcotics
and connections to a local up-and-coming drug ring.
thank you, Detective.
so the baseball bat didn't kill him?
no, though it probably really annoyed him As he was dying ???
anyway, his name was Raj,
and we knew he was about to drop dead 'cause he weighed about 900 pounds!
so, how does a criminal with a drug history
end up dead in the bathroom of a stewardess's condo?
uh, I think they're called Flight attendants now, chief.
Really?
we searched Ashley's condo.
no drugs or cash,
but we found the missing flight attendant,
uh, Ryan Wade's, cellphone.
and it was on... and no incoming calls.
okay, I'd like the apartment gone over again, please,
this time by drug dogs.
detective Gabriel?
uh, yes, uh, chief.
Wade made about, uh, $30, 000 last year...
most of it from colonial airlines.
and I see no signs of money trouble.
and what about the women?
well, I, uh...
haven't done their financials yet,
but, um, neither one of them have criminal records.
thank you. So much.
I mean, I know what a casket's supposed to weigh,
and this was really heavy.
now, how we all doin'?
we're tired, and y'all are treating us Like we had something to do ??? To that horrible "bang-ganger.
for all we know, your acquaintance Ryan Wade
is out on some kind of murderous rampage.
what if we sent you home and he killed you, too?
how would that make us look?
maybe somebody kidnapped Ryan.
now, who would do that?
well, obviously you don't watch the news 'cause if you did,
you would know that there are all kinds of people
doing all sorts of terrible things For no reason whatsoever.
that's true. Yeah. Yeah.
you know, this is what I get for being nice.
I know!
the only reason I even offered Ryan my guest room
was so he didn't have to spend the night in that awful trailer.
Ohh! God.
what trailer?
flight crews don't get layovers In fancy motels anymore.
in between trips, nearly everyone has to stay here.
Hi, Don.
remember that emergency landing on Puget sound About five years back...
???
captain Don Ellis. Retired air force lieutenant.
he lives here now?
Yeah, 10 days a month. You can't beat the price.
and if you ever need to take a shower,
you can always use the 24-hour fitness around the corner.
good morning, Margie!
you on a first-name basis with everybody around here?
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm kind of the unofficial "mayor" of lot b.
Ah! Uh, this is the one you're looking for.
this is where Ryan Wade would be staying.
Yeah.
l.A.P.D!
we've got a warrant. Go for it.
chief!
we've found our missing flight attendant.
ginger thinks ？？？ drugs were here.
I'm guessing whoever shot him didn't need a silencer!
to be fair, commander, Your new office isn't really a cubicle.
it's more like a...
super cubicle.
it has no door.
well, as you know, many layoffs are coming,
and hopefully when space opens up,
we can find you an office more to your liking.
thank you, chief.
30 years on the force, And I get a cubicle.
a cubicle!
more complaints about the building?
and how can I help you?
major crimes has begun a murder investigation That appears drug-related.
we could really use some help. Can't do it.
ever since we started asking for full financial disclosure From our narcotics detectives, ???
one of the many things I'll fix when I'm chief.
what's your case about, anyway?
well, before you get angry, last night, lieutenants Lynn and Provenza...
Yeah, already angry.
what have they done this time?
while escorting a fugitive back from Dallas,
they struck up a date with a couple of stewardesses.
what is this, the '70s?
and, in accompanying his date back to her condo,
lieutenant Provenza found the body Of a known drug trafficker ???
another colleague staying there was missing But has since turned up.
okay, well, that's good.
only he turned up dead...
in a trailer...
where drugs had been present but couldn't be found.
okay, so we have missing drugs and two dead bodies.
any suspects?
only the women...
who were with lieutenants Flynn and Provenza
during the time of the first death.
Flynn and Provenza.
do you have any idea how difficult it is To explain ??? When you're applying to be chief of police?
I might.
what does that mean?
I've been drafted to apply for the chief's position.
believe me, it wasn't my idea.
drafted... who exactly drafted you?
the l. A.P. D. Women's coordinator, Captain Raydor.
she was concerned that other female officers From within the department
I need a day to think about this.
what?
I said I need a day to think about this!
considering that I hired you, I brought you here,
and I've backed you up in every confrontation You've provoked ???
I don't think that's much to ask. Do you?
fine. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
uh, what about my request for narcots officers?
denied. Fine.
we'll do what we can.
I certainly hope My inability to conduct this investigation properly
doesn't end up reflecting poorly on you.
chief, I need to talk to you about this cubicle business.
I'll be happy to discuss your workspace with you, commander,
just as soon as I sort out my double homicide.
thanks for understanding.
buzz, have our guests said anything I should care about?
do you have any interest in bronzer, lip gloss, or waxing?
uh, Detective Gabriel,
anything from the canine unit at the condo?
uh, yes... just like in the trailer, the dogs went crazy.
and just like in the trailer, no narcotics were found.
chief, I've gone over all the flight logs From all the trips ??? Worked on during the past two years.
it looks like they flew with Ryan Wade over 90 times.
so much for your girlfriend Barely knowing her dead houseguest.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Chief, just because they worked together
doesn't mean that they knew each other.
uh, I mean, y-y-you think I have a clue as to what ???
something else, chief.
the morgue went through our dead flight attendant's pockets
and found his key to the trailer.
given that the killer locked the door behind them...
they must have had their own key. Thank you, Detective.
Hey, chief... Jose Coto, the dead guy at the condo?
turns out the feds had a flag on him.
we traded calls with the bureau,
and there's an Agent who would like a word with you.
Oh. Just one second.
look, no matter what, Ryan Wade didn't shoot himself,
so there's still at least one killer outstanding.
and I want to know everything that those women know.
but, chief, l-look,
I-I'm as anxious to close this as you are.
but Ashley and Linda...
these are very respectable ladies.
Flynn, back me up here. Sure thing.
chief, did we meet these girls yesterday?
Absolutely.
do we know them well? I mean, hardly.
I mean, would I stake my reputation on their being on the up-and-up? No.
is it possible that they...
way to back me up, Flynn!
and this dead Ryan guy...
I mean, he could be mixed up with anybody.
lieutenant, has it even occurred to you Th these women ??? 'cause they were using you?
What?! That's crazy!
I won't even dignify that with a response!
I know what's what.
and these girls are crazy about us!
is that so hard to believe?
I'm so sorry.
I've been running all over,
and I should have called to say that this murder,
which is actually now two murders,
is taking a lot longer than I expected.
Oh, you've only just begun.
meet Miguel Diaz... From Honduras.
he owns a freight business here,
which we suspected was enabling a growing drug operation.
the guy you found last night, also from Honduras...
was one of Diaz's drivers.
now, he shows up dead in a flight attendant's condo,
and suddenly it all makes sense.
Diaz's freight business is a front.
lets him launder money While serving as a decoy for the drug smuggling,
which we now believe is handled by airline personnel.
well, as of today,
Diaz has one less operative working for him.
and I got two more down the hall I think are ready to spill.
I'll let you know what I find out. Actually...
honey...
I've been sent here...
to wheedle my way into your investigation.
this is me wheedling.
well, we are shorthanded when it comes to narcotics, but...
would you be helping me solve my case
or would I be helping you solve yours?
is it impossible to think That we could work this out happily together?
probably.
but I'm willing to try.
Oh, well, that's great news.
now, if you really think these two women are involved,
I don't see any rush to break them.
if we hold onto them for a day...
are you asking me to wait a day?
is that a problem?
Yes, it is.
I have a better idea.
we've got orange juice, coffee, sprite.
uh, do you have diet coke?
uh, will diet Pepsi do?
have they gotten anything out of the girls yet?
no, but the girls have gotten plenty out of them.
Oh, chief, we'll clear this stuff away for you.
uh, actually, lieutenant, I'd appreciate it if y'all would just get out.
get out, get out, get out!
thank you. So much.
well, let me start by saying that my officers Have made some ???
Ashley, you may be amazed to learn That there were drugs ???
drugs?
y-you mean like drug drugs?
how would drugs get into Ashley's condo?
you think just like a Detective, Linda.
well, I don't know, but I suppose That Ryan could have ???
and into the condo, taking them with him After killing the man ???
does that sound even remotely possible to you?
can I be totally honest with you?
I'd love for you to try.
I don't know Ryan that well.
but I have always been suspicious That he might be ???
now, why would you let a drug mule Stay in your condo?
well...
he has other positive qualities.
he's really good with the silverware.
and the trash.
he keeps the galley spotless.
Mm-hmm, and he's a very reliable phone-message taker.
you mean he was a reliable phone-message taker.
just look at the damn screens, Hmm?
you see, when we went to that awful trailer this morning, We found Ryan.
but he was, unfortunately, dead.
Ryan's dead?
shot four times. Twice in the head.
now, I'm sure if y'all had known Ryan well That would have made ???
but, still, it must be a little upsetting.
I wonder who might have killed Ryan.
always thinking like a Detective,
aren't you, Linda?
who knows?
as you've seen on the news, The world is a horrible place, eSpecially for people Who are involved in drug drugs ???
by The way...
have either of you young ladies ever seen th man before?
his name is Miguel Diaz.
he's involved with drugs, money laundering, and worse.
Mnh-mnh. No. No.
no? No. Mnh-mnh. Sorry.
well, that's wonderful.
and since y'all don't know anything at all...
and since there's nothing connecting you
to whoever shot Ryan Wade at point-blank range,
y'all are free to go.
wait, wait. I mean, shouldn't we be protected?
from what?
from the unknown.
from, uh...
from whoever killed Ryan.
Oh, people tangled up in drug-mule stuff
like Ryan seems to have been...
those people...
they always get what they have coming to them.
you two, on the other hand, should be just fine.
all right. Well, good luck.
perhaps lieutenants Flynn and Provenza will see you out.
thank you. Thank you so much.
chief!
chief, y-y-you're not gonna make those girls
walk out of here to face god-knows-what.
no, you and lieutenant Flynn Are gonna invite them over to your house. Buzz?
I'll get his place wired right away, chief.
as many cameras as you can hide.
consider this your chance To prove that these women weren't just using you.
and if they were?
use them back.
the only thing I would like about Is there's not enough ???
well, maybe there aren't enough Jews.
uh, my experience has been That the more Jews, the better the Chinese food.
well, it goes back to Moses, who said, "with ten commandments, you get egg rolls.
I don't get it.
no one ever does. Oh. Okay.
here we go.
it's so wonderful of you and Andy to let us stay here tonight.
are you sure if your boss finds out Y'all won't get ???
not a chance.
when he and I are off the clock,
nobody tells us what to do.
would you go easy on me If you knew I smuggled something off the plane?
tiny wine, anybody?
it goes great with take-out.
Flynn: None for me, but you go ahead.
you scared me there for a second.
so what's t deal with your boss?
uh, how do you mean exactly?
well, it's like she thinks She's too good for the beauty pageant.
I mean, believe me, being from the South, I know her type.
like when she says, "thank you,
what she's really saying is...
you know where you can stick that!
I >You know, some women, they just...
they hit that glass ceiling, you know,
and they just get so bitter.
dumplings, anyone?
now, these are delicious!
don't pay attention to them.
Oh, please, honestly... do you think I care
what a couple of stewardesses say about me?
uh, I think they're called flight attendants now, chief.
we'll get to see how good they look in orange jumpsuits.
excuse me.
Hello?
lieutenant, let's not forget we're here to do something
and that someday this may all get played in court.
Oh, you speak Spanish?
Ah, here we go, oh, beautiful one.
the last sip.
for you.
Oh. Thank you.
it feels so safe being here with you two.
Andy, after you find the person who killed Ryan,
will we still have anything to worry about?
who's to say?
as it is, I don't have a clue Why someone would have killed Ryan in the first place.
do you think that it's possible That we could talk to each other like...
like we're regular people?
Yeah.
I mean, could we just take off our uniforms a minute And trust each other?
girls, listen.
Flynn and I work murders.
if this is about...
I don't know... drugs maybe,
believe me, we don't give a damn about that.
well, that guy who you found dead in the tub...
maybe we did know him a little.
how little?
a few years ago, our airline Added a flight from Honduras.
the coffee we brew on the plane comes in sealed bags.
regular has a green dot, decaf has a yellow dot,
and the bags they stocked in Honduras with cocaine Had a white dot.
we just had to make sure That we didn't accidentally open the wrong bag.
after we'd land, we'd take all the white-dot bags
and put them in a big, black trash bag,
and we were done.
jose, the guy in my bathtub, Later on, he'd come by with cash.
well, how often was this?
once a month.
then once a week.
then every L. A. Flight connecting from Honduras.
only, over time, the drug people Gave us less and less for ???
I mean, they said it was the recession, but...
I mean, I don't know.
a girl's got to live, so this week we decided To do something ???
ever since the airline stopped giving us meals,
we've put our food in little cooler bags.
and yesterday Ryan took all the white-dot packets
and carried it in his bag off the plane for us.
Ryan was supposed to hold onto the drugs
until we could sell them to this contact I made.
only I guess things got complicated for Ryan While we were at dinner.
but you don't have any idea who might have shot him?
no, we only ever dealt with Jose.
nobody else was involved in this?
besides the people in Honduras Who we didn't really know, NO
it was just us.
what we did really isn't that bad, is it?
I mean, Kelly our friend Who washes hair in a hair salon,
she doesn't declare any of her tips.
that is not legal.
chief ???
big enough to fly a plane through.
we are close to a direct connection With Miguel Diaz, though.
and look at this.
whenever our flight attendants Were on a plane connecting from Honduras,
it was almost always with the same Captain...
a Captain Mark Wheeler.
captain Wheeler, I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson From the l. A.P. D. ???
and this is Agent Fritz Howard from the FBI.
look, am I under arrest or am I just being questioned?
because your officer read me my rights
and then walked off with all my belongings.
I apologize, sir. We ask people to empty their pockets Before interviews ???
a-and you are welcome to leave,
but we'd appreciate it if you'd answer a few questions first.
about?
??? So he did call you guys, then.
he told he was gonna call us?
look, there's this, uh, trailer next to the airport Where some of us stay.
anyway, Ryan burst in on me And launched into this convoluted story
about drugs and smuggling and a guy who was dead.
and, honestly, I didn't know if he was for real
or if this was some sort of psychotic delusion.
so, what exactly did you say to Mr. Wade?
well, that he should go to the police.
did Mr. Wade have drugs with him When he arrived at the trailer?
no, no, he said that he had sold them to somebody else.
that's pretty much all I got from him before I took off.
and you left him in the trailer?
Ryan said he was convinced That these drug people were after him.
so I went to a hotel because, uh,
he scared the crap out of me.
well, I'm sorry to inform you, sir,
that we found Ryan Wade yesterday, And he had been shot to death.
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea How Mr. Wade's killer might have found him?
you know, uh, Ryan came in a cab.
so perhaps they followed the cab to the parking lot.
there was no break-in,
and the trailer door was locked when we discovered the body.
who else besides you and Mr. Wade have a key?
well, obviously, the owner.
and that would be?
it's one of the women we fly with...
ashely Rogers has two homes in LA.
we found bodies in both of them.
Provenza sure can pick 'em.
chief, Wheeler said that Ryan arrived by taxi.
uh, but we checked, and none of the cab companies Had a pick-up ???
going from Ashley's condo to the airport.
well, Ryan Wade didn't walk to that trailer.
and I'm betting he didn't fly.
he may not have had to, chief.
Ashley Rogers has a car registered in Texas That's been collecting ???
it's not in the condo's garage.
it's not on the surrounding streets.
I'm betting Wade took it.
so, Ashley didn't tell us about the car...
captain Wheeler lied to us About how Wade got to the trailer.
kind of makes you wonder what else those two aren't telling us.
well, I don't know, But I think starting a family argument might help us find out.
detective Sanchez,
may I see Captain Wheeler's personal effects?
why didn't you tell us you had a car?
you never asked!
and I didn't know it was missing.
and Ryan knew I wasn't insured for an additional driver,
so if he took it without my permission, that's theft.
and if Captain Wheeler says that he didn't know about this,
well, then, he is the biggest lying liar ever.
he came to us with the idea.
I bet all that cocaine Ryan had is still in my car.
and somebody's got to get it Before the drug people come for us.
Ryan probably parked it in the personnel lot.
someone should check.
we will, believe me.
uh, there's just one more thing I want to know.
and I want an honest answer.
did the two of you agree to go out with me and Flynn
because you thought we could keep you safe
till you got rid of the drugs and left town?
well, not only.
but maybe mainly.
Yeah, this is Flynn. Get me the chief. Thanks.
so what you're saying is...
you were never really attracted to us.
not so much.
but I'm sure other women are.
like, if you ever came to Dallas,
my mama would go out with you in a heartbeat.
Oh, mine too!
so, they say that the Captain was behind the whole thing.
thank you, lieutenant.
arrest them, refresh their memories about their rights,
and get them down here as quickly as possible.
you got it, chief. See you in about 20 minutes.
all right, you two, I want you to get your stuff.
we're going downtown right now. Come on.
what?
are you upset about those two?
forget about them.
they're criminals.
and they're not the only two flight attendants out there.
I think we just chose the wrong airline.
chief...
I went through all the keys, and none are for the trailer.
thank you so much, Detective Sanchez.
so sorry to keep you in a holding pattern,
captain Wheeler.
seems we're always behind schedule around here.
you know what that's like.
there's so much you can tell about a person From what they carry around ???
don't you think?
for example, looking at this, I'd think that you grew up on a farm...
or maybe you just have a thing for cheese.
am I close?
those aren't my car keys.
aren't they? Oh, w-who do they belong to?
the woman you implied earlier Was responsible for the murder of Ryan Wade?
that Ashley?
Yes, that Ashley.
how is it that you have Ashley Rogers' car?
I borrowed it.
Oh, that's easy enough to confirm.
detective Gabriel, would you please get Ashley Rogers on the line?
uh, oh, no, okay, look.
I didn't mention it before Because I didn't want to complicate things,
but I got Ashley's car from Ryan.
and that would complicate things how?
what, because if we would have known about the car,
we would have gone and looked for it And found the cooler ???
with your fingerprints on it?
mark Wheeler, you are under arrest For the murder ???
wait a minute! I didn't kill Ryan!
Really? That's not how it looks to me.
and that's not how it's gonna look to a jury, either.
but, wait a minute... I-I-I'm telling you
that... that when I left... when I left that trailer,
Ryan was fine.
Where's your key to the trailer?
what? Your key.
you were in the trailer when Ryan got there,
so you must have had a key. Where is it?!
do you have any idea what is going on out there?! Mr. Wheeler!
it used to be when people saw me coming,
that they would stand to attention.
I was... I was one notch below an astronaut.
now...
I'm barely a bus driver.
I get it, Captain Wheeler.
your glory days are over.
who did you give the key to?
I'm arresting someone today for the murder of Ryan Wade.
it's either going to be you Or whoever you gave that key to!
I did not give that key to anyone.
I left that key outside the door...
for Miguel Diaz.
and did you also leave the drugs for Mr. Diaz?
you know something? Ryan killed his guy with a bat!
do you think t-that returning the cocaine...
that was gonna save his life?!
so you figured they were gonna kill him anyway,
so why not just take the dope and make the most of things?
where are the drugs now, Mr. Wheeler?
as far as I know, they're... they're in Ashley's car.
and where did you tell Mr. Diaz they were?
I told him that I didn't know...
that I'd look for them.
well, then...
you're gonna call Mr. Diaz.
you're gonna tell him you found them.
Hey, let's pick it up in there, will ya?!
look, we'll go downtown and we'll sort this out.
Yeah.
Yeah, and everyone will see we're a couple of idiots.
it's had to know how we could look any stupider.
what the...
is that your car?!
Yeah.
Yeah, but the joke's on them! I'm nearly out of gas!
they're going to the airport personnel lot.
please tell me that you are not calling the chief.
I'm calling a cab.
detective Sanchez?
ready, chief. I can see Ashley's car.
lieutenant Tao?
all set, chief.
okay, just make the exchange...
drugs for the money and key...
and walk.
we've got you covered from all sides.
what in the hell?
Hey! Stop! That's not yours!
keep going! Keep going! Go! Go! Go! Go!
go! Go! Go! Go!
we see you! Stop that cart!
police! Police!
police! Put your hands up!
get those hands in the air!
get your hands up! Put your hands up!
Hey! Wait a minute! Hey! Get back here!
get 'em up! Get 'em up!
this is not good.
go! Go! Go! Go!
you guys got all this under control?
Yes, lieutenant. Thank you so much.
good.
now where the hell is my car?!
Where's my car?!
Hey, you skanks!
bring me my car!
Buh-bye! Have a nice day, now!
Buh-bye! See ya again real soon!
thank you so much!
no, thank you!
Ah, that didn't work out so badly, did it?
closed two murder cases and broke a narcotics ring.
and spent more time together in the past two days Than all of last month.
happy happy.
don't stay too late.
and good luck with Pope, huh?
Oh, commander Taylor!
I love what you've done with the space!
well, chief, you know, it may not look it,
but... but square-foot-wise,
it... it's bigger than my old office.
do you have a minute?
Yeah, I've been meaning to find you, actually, To offer my congratulations.
thank you.
and to say I thought about what we discussed earlier,
and, uh, I think you should definitely Submit your application
I'm only sorry I didn't recognize that yesterday.
are you?
Yeah, it seems obvious now.
I mean, there should be a high-ranking female From within the department ???
and, uh, if there's gonna be a woman in the candidate pool,
better it be you than somebody else.
a-a-and that's because?
well, your presence will help deter other women from applying.
and, you know, you'll be given "serious consideration,
but they'll never hire you as chief in a million years,
so, really, it's perfect for me.
is that so?
what makes you so certain I won't get it?
Brenda, please, you...
you can't even control your own officers.
and Flynn and Provenza were outwitted By a couple of stewardesses.
flight attendants. And they weren't outwitted.
Really?
where are they now?
you know, maybe if you hadn't called them A couple of skanks,
they would have told us where they parked your car.
I'm just saying.
do you think it's possible for you to shut up?!
look to the left.
I'll look to the right.
Hey, I'm not the one who started talking to these two broads!
Oh, you're the one that picked them up on that plane!
Oh, no, I was not! What, are you kidding me?
Oh, every woman you see, you got to go try to pick up!
so, it's my first death notification
and I'm a little nervous.
sorry about what happened to your grandpa, here's my card,
you know, blah, blah, blah.
anyway, I'm about halfway out the door When my partner, Ray, "hey, knucklehead, before they show up to see the body, "you maybe want to go inside and tell the family
that grandpa is missing his head!
the grandfather had...
no head!
so, I'm sure you two don't date
all of your first-class passengers.
Oh, no, no.
just the cute ones.
are you, uh, enjoying your drive?
because if you're tired...
Oh, not at all, darlin'. I could go all night.
your destination is ahead.
the skies look very friendly.
you got everything you need?
my friend Ryan's in the guest room.
do you know how to be quiet?
I think so.
well, that's too bad.
cause I only know how to be loud.
Oh, God.
I love the bovine motif.
do you? Yeah!
I think I may have been a cow in another life.
Hey, how 'bout a little "moo-sage"?
there's baby oil in the bathroom.
20 minutes.
20 minutes. Baby oil.
15 minutes.
15 minutes. Heh.
Hey, Mr. Policeman...
what do you think about these?
how would you feel about a real pair?
what?
your friend Ryan...
is he about 6 feet tall?
lots of tattoos? Not so talkative?
Why?
Oh, my God!
who is that?
you really don't know him?
No!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
hmm, 93 degrees.
so, uh, there's no sign of forced entry,
suggesting that our missing flight attendant, Ryan Wade,
either opened the door for the victim
or he possibly picked him up, brought him home for a hook-up.
Really?
people still pick up strangers for sex In this day and age?
all right. Ma'am...
was your friend Ryan the sort to bring home
someone like the man lying dead in the bathtub?
I don't know.
I mean, I can't say.
which is it... you don't know or you can't say?
I barely know Ryan.
but if I ever thought he'd bring a man like that home,
I never would have given him the key.
lieutenant, rather than just sit here,
why don't you get up and join the investigation?
you know, chief, I-I don't think Standing up is such
chief, the victim's got no I.D.
coroner's investigator says he's almost full lividity,
liver temperature's 93 degrees,
placing time of death around 9: 00 P.M.
that's good news.
Why?
the girls came back here after our flight,
but by 8: 00 P. M. we were all out having dinner At Musso and Frank's.
Yes, lieutenant, it's always good news
when suspects in a homicide Can point to us for their alibi.
also, chief, I think our killer Left big, stubby fingerprints practically everywhere.
well, um, some of those fingerprints
might be...
...Mine.
two hands on the sink?
palm on the mirror?
not the murder weapon?!
Yes, Tao, yes!
all right?!
look, at first, I didn't know I was in a crime scene,
and I-I didn't clean up after myself because
I didn't want to run the risk of wiping away the killer's prints.
my actions throughout Have been as highly professional as always.
chief.
do you want me to book these into evidence?
no.
I'll run everything, including our Juan Doe's prints, through AFIS.
just to be clear...
we're calling this a major crime because...
look, whenever a member of my division stumbles on a body,
it is automatically a major crime.
all right, uh, Detective Gabriel, With me, please, to the morgue.
and lieutenants Flynn and Provenza,
let's take our suspects downtown,
read them their rights, and try to keep them happy and talking.
easy enough, chief.
we were keeping them happy and talking before.
Ashley believes That she might have been a cow in a previous life.
can you stand up yet?
give me five minutes, would ya?
fine, but according to the ad, Pretty soon you're gonna have to call a doctor.
the second cervical vertebrae is shattered,
which would have caused paralysis of the diaphragm And instant suffocation.
wait, wait, are you saying the killer broke this guy's neck With a baseball bat?
uh, doubtful.
I mean, an athlete with your physique Could have done that,
but from what I can see,
the person you're looking for Wasn't picked first in gym class.
I count 83 bruises...
Hello? Gabriel here.
suggesting the assailant closed their eyes And swung randomly.
looks to me like Juan broke his neck When he tripped in the tub.
frankly, I'm not even sure I would call this a murder.
seems to me more like, uh...
an accidental death In the middle of someone else's hissy fit.
okay. I will let her know.
chief, AFIS identified our victim...
he's got numerous arrests for narcotics
and connections to a local up-and-coming drug ring.
thank you, Detective.
so the baseball bat didn't kill him?
no, though it probably really annoyed him As he was dying ???
anyway, his name was Raj,
and we knew he was about to drop dead 'cause he weighed about 900 pounds!
so, how does a criminal with a drug history
end up dead in the bathroom of a stewardess's condo?
uh, I think they're called Flight attendants now, chief.
Really?
we searched Ashley's condo.
no drugs or cash,
but we found the missing flight attendant,
uh, Ryan Wade's, cellphone.
and it was on... and no incoming calls.
okay, I'd like the apartment gone over again, please,
this time by drug dogs.
detective Gabriel?
uh, yes, uh, chief.
Wade made about, uh, $30, 000 last year...
most of it from colonial airlines.
and I see no signs of money trouble.
and what about the women?
well, I, uh...
haven't done their financials yet,
but, um, neither one of them have criminal records.
thank you. So much.
I mean, I know what a casket's supposed to weigh,
and this was really heavy.
now, how we all doin'?
we're tired, and y'all are treating us Like we had something to do ??? To that horrible "bang-ganger.
for all we know, your acquaintance Ryan Wade
is out on some kind of murderous rampage.
what if we sent you home and he killed you, too?
how would that make us look?
maybe somebody kidnapped Ryan.
now, who would do that?
well, obviously you don't watch the news 'cause if you did,
you would know that there are all kinds of people
doing all sorts of terrible things For no reason whatsoever.
that's true. Yeah. Yeah.
you know, this is what I get for being nice.
I know!
the only reason I even offered Ryan my guest room
was so he didn't have to spend the night in that awful trailer.
Ohh! God.
what trailer?
flight crews don't get layovers In fancy motels anymore.
in between trips, nearly everyone has to stay here.
Hi, Don.
remember that emergency landing on Puget sound About five years back...
???
captain Don Ellis. Retired air force lieutenant.
he lives here now?
Yeah, 10 days a month. You can't beat the price.
and if you ever need to take a shower,
you can always use the 24-hour fitness around the corner.
good morning, Margie!
you on a first-name basis with everybody around here?
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm kind of the unofficial "mayor" of lot b.
Ah! Uh, this is the one you're looking for.
this is where Ryan Wade would be staying.
Yeah.
l.A.P.D!
we've got a warrant. Go for it.
chief!
we've found our missing flight attendant.
ginger thinks ？？？ drugs were here.
I'm guessing whoever shot him didn't need a silencer!
to be fair, commander, Your new office isn't really a cubicle.
it's more like a...
super cubicle.
it has no door.
well, as you know, many layoffs are coming,
and hopefully when space opens up,
we can find you an office more to your liking.
thank you, chief.
30 years on the force, And I get a cubicle.
a cubicle!
more complaints about the building?
and how can I help you?
major crimes has begun a murder investigation That appears drug-related.
we could really use some help. Can't do it.
ever since we started asking for full financial disclosure From our narcotics detectives, ???
one of the many things I'll fix when I'm chief.
what's your case about, anyway?
well, before you get angry, last night, lieutenants Lynn and Provenza...
Yeah, already angry.
what have they done this time?
while escorting a fugitive back from Dallas,
they struck up a date with a couple of stewardesses.
what is this, the '70s?
and, in accompanying his date back to her condo,
lieutenant Provenza found the body Of a known drug trafficker ???
another colleague staying there was missing But has since turned up.
okay, well, that's good.
only he turned up dead...
in a trailer...
where drugs had been present but couldn't be found.
okay, so we have missing drugs and two dead bodies.
any suspects?
only the women...
who were with lieutenants Flynn and Provenza
during the time of the first death.
Flynn and Provenza.
do you have any idea how difficult it is To explain ??? When you're applying to be chief of police?
I might.
what does that mean?
I've been drafted to apply for the chief's position.
believe me, it wasn't my idea.
drafted... who exactly drafted you?
the l. A.P. D. Women's coordinator, Captain Raydor.
she was concerned that other female officers From within the department
I need a day to think about this.
what?
I said I need a day to think about this!
considering that I hired you, I brought you here,
and I've backed you up in every confrontation You've provoked ???
I don't think that's much to ask. Do you?
fine. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
uh, what about my request for narcots officers?
denied. Fine.
we'll do what we can.
I certainly hope My inability to conduct this investigation properly
doesn't end up reflecting poorly on you.
chief, I need to talk to you about this cubicle business.
I'll be happy to discuss your workspace with you, commander,
just as soon as I sort out my double homicide.
thanks for understanding.
buzz, have our guests said anything I should care about?
do you have any interest in bronzer, lip gloss, or waxing?
uh, Detective Gabriel,
anything from the canine unit at the condo?
uh, yes... just like in the trailer, the dogs went crazy.
and just like in the trailer, no narcotics were found.
chief, I've gone over all the flight logs From all the trips ??? Worked on during the past two years.
it looks like they flew with Ryan Wade over 90 times.
so much for your girlfriend Barely knowing her dead houseguest.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Chief, just because they worked together
doesn't mean that they knew each other.
uh, I mean, y-y-you think I have a clue as to what ???
something else, chief.
the morgue went through our dead flight attendant's pockets
and found his key to the trailer.
given that the killer locked the door behind them...
they must have had their own key. Thank you, Detective.
Hey, chief... Jose Coto, the dead guy at the condo?
turns out the feds had a flag on him.
we traded calls with the bureau,
and there's an Agent who would like a word with you.
Oh. Just one second.
look, no matter what, Ryan Wade didn't shoot himself,
so there's still at least one killer outstanding.
and I want to know everything that those women know.
but, chief, l-look,
I-I'm as anxious to close this as you are.
but Ashley and Linda...
these are very respectable ladies.
Flynn, back me up here. Sure thing.
chief, did we meet these girls yesterday?
Absolutely.
do we know them well? I mean, hardly.
I mean, would I stake my reputation on their being on the up-and-up? No.
is it possible that they...
way to back me up, Flynn!
and this dead Ryan guy...
I mean, he could be mixed up with anybody.
lieutenant, has it even occurred to you Th these women ??? 'cause they were using you?
What?! That's crazy!
I won't even dignify that with a response!
I know what's what.
and these girls are crazy about us!
is that so hard to believe?
I'm so sorry.
I've been running all over,
and I should have called to say that this murder,
which is actually now two murders,
is taking a lot longer than I expected.
Oh, you've only just begun.
meet Miguel Diaz... From Honduras.
he owns a freight business here,
which we suspected was enabling a growing drug operation.
the guy you found last night, also from Honduras...
was one of Diaz's drivers.
now, he shows up dead in a flight attendant's condo,
and suddenly it all makes sense.
Diaz's freight business is a front.
lets him launder money While serving as a decoy for the drug smuggling,
which we now believe is handled by airline personnel.
well, as of today,
Diaz has one less operative working for him.
and I got two more down the hall I think are ready to spill.
I'll let you know what I find out. Actually...
honey...
I've been sent here...
to wheedle my way into your investigation.
this is me wheedling.
well, we are shorthanded when it comes to narcotics, but...
would you be helping me solve my case
or would I be helping you solve yours?
is it impossible to think That we could work this out happily together?
probably.
but I'm willing to try.
Oh, well, that's great news.
now, if you really think these two women are involved,
I don't see any rush to break them.
if we hold onto them for a day...
are you asking me to wait a day?
is that a problem?
Yes, it is.
I have a better idea.
we've got orange juice, coffee, sprite.
uh, do you have diet coke?
uh, will diet Pepsi do?
have they gotten anything out of the girls yet?
no, but the girls have gotten plenty out of them.
Oh, chief, we'll clear this stuff away for you.
uh, actually, lieutenant, I'd appreciate it if y'all would just get out.
get out, get out, get out!
thank you. So much.
well, let me start by saying that my officers Have made some ???
Ashley, you may be amazed to learn That there were drugs ???
drugs?
y-you mean like drug drugs?
how would drugs get into Ashley's condo?
you think just like a Detective, Linda.
well, I don't know, but I suppose That Ryan could have ???
and into the condo, taking them with him After killing the man ???
does that sound even remotely possible to you?
can I be totally honest with you?
I'd love for you to try.
I don't know Ryan that well.
but I have always been suspicious That he might be ???
now, why would you let a drug mule Stay in your condo?
well...
he has other positive qualities.
he's really good with the silverware.
and the trash.
he keeps the galley spotless.
Mm-hmm, and he's a very reliable phone-message taker.
you mean he was a reliable phone-message taker.
just look at the damn screens, Hmm?
you see, when we went to that awful trailer this morning, We found Ryan.
but he was, unfortunately, dead.
Ryan's dead?
shot four times. Twice in the head.
now, I'm sure if y'all had known Ryan well That would have made ???
but, still, it must be a little upsetting.
I wonder who might have killed Ryan.
always thinking like a Detective,
aren't you, Linda?
who knows?
as you've seen on the news, The world is a horrible place, eSpecially for people Who are involved in drug drugs ???
by The way...
have either of you young ladies ever seen th man before?
his name is Miguel Diaz.
he's involved with drugs, money laundering, and worse.
Mnh-mnh. No. No.
no? No. Mnh-mnh. Sorry.
well, that's wonderful.
and since y'all don't know anything at all...
and since there's nothing connecting you
to whoever shot Ryan Wade at point-blank range,
y'all are free to go.
wait, wait. I mean, shouldn't we be protected?
from what?
from the unknown.
from, uh...
from whoever killed Ryan.
Oh, people tangled up in drug-mule stuff
like Ryan seems to have been...
those people...
they always get what they have coming to them.
you two, on the other hand, should be just fine.
all right. Well, good luck.
perhaps lieutenants Flynn and Provenza will see you out.
thank you. Thank you so much.
chief!
chief, y-y-you're not gonna make those girls
walk out of here to face god-knows-what.
no, you and lieutenant Flynn Are gonna invite them over to your house. Buzz?
I'll get his place wired right away, chief.
as many cameras as you can hide.
consider this your chance To prove that these women weren't just using you.
and if they were?
use them back.
the only thing I would like about Is there's not enough ???
well, maybe there aren't enough Jews.
uh, my experience has been That the more Jews, the better the Chinese food.
well, it goes back to Moses, who said, "with ten commandments, you get egg rolls.
I don't get it.
no one ever does. Oh. Okay.
here we go.
it's so wonderful of you and Andy to let us stay here tonight.
are you sure if your boss finds out Y'all won't get ???
not a chance.
when he and I are off the clock,
nobody tells us what to do.
would you go easy on me If you knew I smuggled something off the plane?
tiny wine, anybody?
it goes great with take-out.
Flynn: None for me, but you go ahead.
you scared me there for a second.
so what's t deal with your boss?
uh, how do you mean exactly?
well, it's like she thinks She's too good for the beauty pageant.
I mean, believe me, being from the South, I know her type.
like when she says, "thank you,
what she's really saying is...
you know where you can stick that!
I >You know, some women, they just...
they hit that glass ceiling, you know,
and they just get so bitter.
dumplings, anyone?
now, these are delicious!
don't pay attention to them.
Oh, please, honestly... do you think I care
what a couple of stewardesses say about me?
uh, I think they're called flight attendants now, chief.
we'll get to see how good they look in orange jumpsuits.
excuse me.
Hello?
lieutenant, let's not forget we're here to do something
and that someday this may all get played in court.
Oh, you speak Spanish?
Ah, here we go, oh, beautiful one.
the last sip.
for you.
Oh. Thank you.
it feels so safe being here with you two.
Andy, after you find the person who killed Ryan,
will we still have anything to worry about?
who's to say?
as it is, I don't have a clue Why someone would have killed Ryan in the first place.
do you think that it's possible That we could talk to each other like...
like we're regular people?
Yeah.
I mean, could we just take off our uniforms a minute And trust each other?
girls, listen.
Flynn and I work murders.
if this is about...
I don't know... drugs maybe,
believe me, we don't give a damn about that.
well, that guy who you found dead in the tub...
maybe we did know him a little.
how little?
a few years ago, our airline Added a flight from Honduras.
the coffee we brew on the plane comes in sealed bags.
regular has a green dot, decaf has a yellow dot,
and the bags they stocked in Honduras with cocaine Had a white dot.
we just had to make sure That we didn't accidentally open the wrong bag.
after we'd land, we'd take all the white-dot bags
and put them in a big, black trash bag,
and we were done.
jose, the guy in my bathtub, Later on, he'd come by with cash.
well, how often was this?
once a month.
then once a week.
then every L. A. Flight connecting from Honduras.
only, over time, the drug people Gave us less and less for ???
I mean, they said it was the recession, but...
I mean, I don't know.
a girl's got to live, so this week we decided To do something ???
ever since the airline stopped giving us meals,
we've put our food in little cooler bags.
and yesterday Ryan took all the white-dot packets
and carried it in his bag off the plane for us.
Ryan was supposed to hold onto the drugs
until we could sell them to this contact I made.
only I guess things got complicated for Ryan While we were at dinner.
but you don't have any idea who might have shot him?
no, we only ever dealt with Jose.
nobody else was involved in this?
besides the people in Honduras Who we didn't really know, NO
it was just us.
what we did really isn't that bad, is it?
I mean, Kelly our friend Who washes hair in a hair salon,
she doesn't declare any of her tips.
that is not legal.
chief ???
big enough to fly a plane through.
we are close to a direct connection With Miguel Diaz, though.
and look at this.
whenever our flight attendants Were on a plane connecting from Honduras,
it was almost always with the same Captain...
a Captain Mark Wheeler.
captain Wheeler, I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson From the l. A.P. D. ???
and this is Agent Fritz Howard from the FBI.
look, am I under arrest or am I just being questioned?
because your officer read me my rights
and then walked off with all my belongings.
I apologize, sir. We ask people to empty their pockets Before interviews ???
a-and you are welcome to leave,
but we'd appreciate it if you'd answer a few questions first.
about?
??? So he did call you guys, then.
he told he was gonna call us?
look, there's this, uh, trailer next to the airport Where some of us stay.
anyway, Ryan burst in on me And launched into this convoluted story
about drugs and smuggling and a guy who was dead.
and, honestly, I didn't know if he was for real
or if this was some sort of psychotic delusion.
so, what exactly did you say to Mr. Wade?
well, that he should go to the police.
did Mr. Wade have drugs with him When he arrived at the trailer?
no, no, he said that he had sold them to somebody else.
that's pretty much all I got from him before I took off.
and you left him in the trailer?
Ryan said he was convinced That these drug people were after him.
so I went to a hotel because, uh,
he scared the crap out of me.
well, I'm sorry to inform you, sir,
that we found Ryan Wade yesterday, And he had been shot to death.
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea How Mr. Wade's killer might have found him?
you know, uh, Ryan came in a cab.
so perhaps they followed the cab to the parking lot.
there was no break-in,
and the trailer door was locked when we discovered the body.
who else besides you and Mr. Wade have a key?
well, obviously, the owner.
and that would be?
it's one of the women we fly with...
ashely Rogers has two homes in LA.
we found bodies in both of them.
Provenza sure can pick 'em.
chief, Wheeler said that Ryan arrived by taxi.
uh, but we checked, and none of the cab companies Had a pick-up ???
going from Ashley's condo to the airport.
well, Ryan Wade didn't walk to that trailer.
and I'm betting he didn't fly.
he may not have had to, chief.
Ashley Rogers has a car registered in Texas That's been collecting ???
it's not in the condo's garage.
it's not on the surrounding streets.
I'm betting Wade took it.
so, Ashley didn't tell us about the car...
captain Wheeler lied to us About how Wade got to the trailer.
kind of makes you wonder what else those two aren't telling us.
well, I don't know, But I think starting a family argument might help us find out.
detective Sanchez,
may I see Captain Wheeler's personal effects?
why didn't you tell us you had a car?
you never asked!
and I didn't know it was missing.
and Ryan knew I wasn't insured for an additional driver,
so if he took it without my permission, that's theft.
and if Captain Wheeler says that he didn't know about this,
well, then, he is the biggest lying liar ever.
he came to us with the idea.
I bet all that cocaine Ryan had is still in my car.
and somebody's got to get it Before the drug people come for us.
Ryan probably parked it in the personnel lot.
someone should check.
we will, believe me.
uh, there's just one more thing I want to know.
and I want an honest answer.
did the two of you agree to go out with me and Flynn
because you thought we could keep you safe
till you got rid of the drugs and left town?
well, not only.
but maybe mainly.
Yeah, this is Flynn. Get me the chief. Thanks.
so what you're saying is...
you were never really attracted to us.
not so much.
but I'm sure other women are.
like, if you ever came to Dallas,
my mama would go out with you in a heartbeat.
Oh, mine too!
so, they say that the Captain was behind the whole thing.
thank you, lieutenant.
arrest them, refresh their memories about their rights,
and get them down here as quickly as possible.
you got it, chief. See you in about 20 minutes.
all right, you two, I want you to get your stuff.
we're going downtown right now. Come on.
what?
are you upset about those two?
forget about them.
they're criminals.
and they're not the only two flight attendants out there.
I think we just chose the wrong airline.
chief...
I went through all the keys, and none are for the trailer.
thank you so much, Detective Sanchez.
so sorry to keep you in a holding pattern,
captain Wheeler.
seems we're always behind schedule around here.
you know what that's like.
there's so much you can tell about a person From what they carry around ???
don't you think?
for example, looking at this, I'd think that you grew up on a farm...
or maybe you just have a thing for cheese.
am I close?
those aren't my car keys.
aren't they? Oh, w-who do they belong to?
the woman you implied earlier Was responsible for the murder of Ryan Wade?
that Ashley?
Yes, that Ashley.
how is it that you have Ashley Rogers' car?
I borrowed it.
Oh, that's easy enough to confirm.
detective Gabriel, would you please get Ashley Rogers on the line?
uh, oh, no, okay, look.
I didn't mention it before Because I didn't want to complicate things,
but I got Ashley's car from Ryan.
and that would complicate things how?
what, because if we would have known about the car,
we would have gone and looked for it And found the cooler ???
with your fingerprints on it?
mark Wheeler, you are under arrest For the murder ???
wait a minute! I didn't kill Ryan!
Really? That's not how it looks to me.
and that's not how it's gonna look to a jury, either.
but, wait a minute... I-I-I'm telling you
that... that when I left... when I left that trailer,
Ryan was fine.
Where's your key to the trailer?
what? Your key.
you were in the trailer when Ryan got there,
so you must have had a key. Where is it?!
do you have any idea what is going on out there?! Mr. Wheeler!
it used to be when people saw me coming,
that they would stand to attention.
I was... I was one notch below an astronaut.
now...
I'm barely a bus driver.
I get it, Captain Wheeler.
your glory days are over.
who did you give the key to?
I'm arresting someone today for the murder of Ryan Wade.
it's either going to be you Or whoever you gave that key to!
I did not give that key to anyone.
I left that key outside the door...
for Miguel Diaz.
and did you also leave the drugs for Mr. Diaz?
you know something? Ryan killed his guy with a bat!
do you think t-that returning the cocaine...
that was gonna save his life?!
so you figured they were gonna kill him anyway,
so why not just take the dope and make the most of things?
where are the drugs now, Mr. Wheeler?
as far as I know, they're... they're in Ashley's car.
and where did you tell Mr. Diaz they were?
I told him that I didn't know...
that I'd look for them.
well, then...
you're gonna call Mr. Diaz.
you're gonna tell him you found them.
Hey, let's pick it up in there, will ya?!
look, we'll go downtown and we'll sort this out.
Yeah.
Yeah, and everyone will see we're a couple of idiots.
it's had to know how we could look any stupider.
what the...
is that your car?!
Yeah.
Yeah, but the joke's on them! I'm nearly out of gas!
they're going to the airport personnel lot.
please tell me that you are not calling the chief.
I'm calling a cab.
detective Sanchez?
ready, chief. I can see Ashley's car.
lieutenant Tao?
all set, chief.
okay, just make the exchange...
drugs for the money and key...
and walk.
we've got you covered from all sides.
what in the hell?
Hey! Stop! That's not yours!
keep going! Keep going! Go! Go! Go! Go!
go! Go! Go! Go!
we see you! Stop that cart!
police! Police!
police! Put your hands up!
get those hands in the air!
get your hands up! Put your hands up!
Hey! Wait a minute! Hey! Get back here!
get 'em up! Get 'em up!
this is not good.
go! Go! Go! Go!
you guys got all this under control?
Yes, lieutenant. Thank you so much.
good.
now where the hell is my car?!
Where's my car?!
Hey, you skanks!
bring me my car!
Buh-bye! Have a nice day, now!
Buh-bye! See ya again real soon!
thank you so much!
no, thank you!
Ah, that didn't work out so badly, did it?
closed two murder cases and broke a narcotics ring.
and spent more time together in the past two days Than all of last month.
happy happy.
don't stay too late.
and good luck with Pope, huh?
Oh, commander Taylor!
I love what you've done with the space!
well, chief, you know, it may not look it,
but... but square-foot-wise,
it... it's bigger than my old office.
do you have a minute?
Yeah, I've been meaning to find you, actually, To offer my congratulations.
thank you.
and to say I thought about what we discussed earlier,
and, uh, I think you should definitely Submit your application
I'm only sorry I didn't recognize that yesterday.
are you?
Yeah, it seems obvious now.
I mean, there should be a high-ranking female From within the department ???
and, uh, if there's gonna be a woman in the candidate pool,
better it be you than somebody else.
a-a-and that's because?
well, your presence will help deter other women from applying.
and, you know, you'll be given "serious consideration,
but they'll never hire you as chief in a million years,
so, really, it's perfect for me.
is that so?
what makes you so certain I won't get it?
Brenda, please, you...
you can't even control your own officers.
and Flynn and Provenza were outwitted By a couple of stewardesses.
flight attendants. And they weren't outwitted.
Really?
where are they now?
you know, maybe if you hadn't called them A couple of skanks,
they would have told us where they parked your car.
I'm just saying.
do you think it's possible for you to shut up?!
look to the left.
I'll look to the right.
Hey, I'm not the one who started talking to these two broads!
Oh, you're the one that picked them up on that plane!
Oh, no, I was not! What, are you kidding me?
Oh, every woman you see, you got to go try to pick up!
so, it's my first death notification And I'm a little nervous.
sorry about what happened to your grandpa, here's my card," You know, blah, blah, blah.
anyway, I'm about halfway out the door When my partner, Ray, says to me, "hey, knucklehead, before they show up to see the body,
you maybe want to go inside and tell the family That grandpa is missing his head!
the grandfather had... No head!
so, I'm sure you two don't date All of your first-class passengers.
Oh, no, no. Just the cute ones.
are you, uh, enjoying your drive?
because if you're tired... - Oh, not at all, darlin'.
I could go all night.
your destination is ahead.
the skies look very friendly.
you got everything you need?
my friend Ryan's in the guest room.
do you know how to be quiet? - I think so.
well, that's too bad. 'Cause I only know how to be loud.
Oh, God.
Whoa! I love the bovine motif.
do you? - Yeah!
I think I may have been a cow in another life.
Hey, how 'bout a little "moo-sage"?
there's baby oil in the bathroom.
20 minutes. 20 minutes.
baby oil. Baby oil.
15 minutes. 15 minutes.
Hey, Mr. Policeman...
what do you think about these?
how would you feel about a real pair?
what? - Your friend Ryan...
is he about 6 feet tall?
lots of tattoos? Not so talkative?
Why?
Oh, my God! Who is that?
you really don't know him? - No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
hmm, 93 degrees.
so, uh, there's no sign of forced entry,
suggesting that our missing flight attendant, Ryan Wade,
either opened the door for the victim Or he possibly picked him up, brought him home for a hook-up.
Really? People still pick up strangers for sex In this day and age?
all right. Ma'am...
was your friend Ryan the sort to bring home Someone like the man lying dead in the bathtub?
I don't know.
I mean, I can't say.
which is it...you don't know or you can't say?
I barely know Ryan.
but if I ever thought he'd bring a man like that home,
I never would have given him the key.
lieutenant, rather than just sit here,
why don't you get up and join the investigation?
you know, chief, I-I don't think Standing up is such a good idea right now.
chief, the victim's got no I.D.
coroner's investigator says he's almost full lividity,
liver temperature's 93 degrees, Placing time of death around 9: 00 P.M.
that's good news. - Why?
the girls came back here after our flight, But by 8: 00 P. M. we were all out having dinner At Musso and Frank's.
Yes, lieutenant, it's always good news
when suspects in a homicide Can point to us for their alibi.
also, chief, I think our killer Left big, stubby fingerprints practically everywhere.
well, um, some of those fingerprints Might be...
mine.
two hands on the sink?
palm on the mirror? Not the murder weapon?!
Yes, tao, yes!
all right?! Look, at first, I didn't know I was in a crime scene,
and I-I didn't clean up after myself because I didn't want to run the risk of wiping away the killer's prints.
my actions throughout Have been as highly professional as always.
chief.
do you want me to book these into evidence?
no.
I'll run everything, including our Juan Doe's prints, Through AFIS.
just to be clear...We're calling this a major crime because...
look, whenever a member of my division stumbles on a body,
it is automatically a major crime.
all right, uh, Detective Gabriel, With me, please, to the morgue.
and lieutenants Flynn and provenza, Let's take our suspects downtown,
read them their rights, and try to keep them happy and talking.
easy enough, chief. We were keeping them happy and talking before.
Ashley believes That she might have been a cow in a previous life.
can you stand up yet?
give me five minutes, would ya?
fine, but according to the ad, Pretty soon you're gonna have to call a doctor.
the second cervical vertebrae is shattered,
which would have caused paralysis of the diaphragm And instant suffocation.
wait, wait, are you saying the killer broke this guy's neck With a baseball bat?
uh, doubtful.
I mean, an athlete with your physique Could have done that,
but from what I can see, The person you're looking for
wasn't picked first in gym class.
I count 83 bruises...
Hello? Gabriel here.
suggesting the assailant closed their eyes And swung randomly.
looks to me like Juan broke his neck When he tripped in the tub.
frankly, I'm not even sure I would call this a murder.
seems to me more like, uh...
an accidental death In the middle of someone else's hissy fit.
okay. I will let her know.
chief, AFIS identified our victim...Jose Coto.
he's got numerous arrests for narcotics
and connections to a local up-and-coming drug ring.
thank you, Detective. So the baseball bat didn't kill him?
no, though it probably really annoyed him As he was dying from a broken neck.
anyway, his name was Raj,
and we knew he was about to drop dead 'cause he weighed about 900 pounds!
so, how does a criminal with a drug history
end up dead in the bathroom of a stewardess's condo?
uh, I think they're called Flight attendants now, chief.
Really?
we searched Ashley's condo.
no drugs or cash, But we found the missing flight attendant,
uh, Ryan Wade's, cellphone.
and it was on... and no incoming calls.
okay, I'd like the apartment gone over again, please, This time by drug dogs.
detective Gabriel? - Uh, yes, uh, chief.
Wade made about, uh, $30, 000 last year... Most of it from colonial airlines.
and I sent no signs of money trouble.
and what about the women? - Well, I,uh...
haven't done their financials yet,
but, um, neither one of them have criminal records.
thank you. So much.
I mean, I know what a casket's supposed to weigh, And this was really heavy.
now, how we all doin'?
we're tired, and y'all are treating us Like we had something to do with whatever happened To that horrible "bang-ganger.
for all we know, your acquaintance Ryan Wade
is out on some kind of murderous rampage.
what if we sent you home and he killed you, too?
how would that make us look?
maybe somebody kidnapped Ryan.
now, who would do that?
well, obviously you don't watch the news 'cause if you did, You would know that there are all kinds of people
doing all sorts of terrible things For no reason whatsoever.
that's true.
Yeah. - Yeah.
you know, this is what I get for being nice.
I know!
the only reason I even offered Ryan my guest room
was so he didn't have to spend the night in that awful trailer.
Oh God.
what trailer?
flight crews don't get layovers In fancy motels anymore.
in between trips, nearly everyone has to stay here.
remember that emergency landing on Puget sound About five years back...
the hero pilot? - Captain don Ellis.
retired air force lieutenant.
he lives here now? - Yeah, 10 days a month.
you can't beat the price. And if you ever need to take a shower,
you can always use the 24-hour fitness around the corner.
good morning, Margie!
you on a first-name basis with everybody around here?
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm kind of the unofficial "mayor" of lot b.
uh, this is the one you're looking for.
this is where Ryan Wade would be staying.
Yeah.
L.A.P.D.
we've got a warrant. Go for it.
chief!
we've found our missing flight attendant.
ginger thinks drugs were here.
I'm guessing whoever shot him didn't need a silencer!
to be fair, commander, Your new office isn't really a cubicle.
it's more like a... Super cubicle.
it has no door.
well, as you know, many layoffs are coming,
and hopefully when space opens up,
we can find you an office more to your liking.
thank you, chief.
30 years on the force, And I get a cubicle.
a cubicle!
more complaints about the building?
and how can I help you?
major crimes has begun a murder investigation That appears drug-related.
we could really use some help. - Can't do it.
ever since we started asking for full financial disclosure From our narcotics detectives, they've all transferred...One of the many things I'll fix when I'm chief.
what's your case about, anyway?
well, before you get angry, Uh, last night, lieutenants Lynn and Provenza...
Yeah, already angry.
what have they done this time?
while escorting a fugitive back from Dallas,
they struck up a date with a couple of stewardesses.
what is this, the '70s?
and, in accompanying his date back to her condo,
lieutenant provenza found the body Of a known drug trafficker in the bathroom.
another colleague staying there was missing But has since turned up.
okay, well, that's good. - Only he turned up dead...
in a trailer...Where drugs had been present but couldn't be found.
okay, so we have missing drugs and two dead bodies.
any suspects? - Only the women...
who were with lieutenants Flynn and Provenza During the time of the first death.
Flynn and Provenza.
do you have any idea how difficult it is To explain this kind of behavior when you're applying to be chief of police?
I might.
what does that mean?
I've been drafted to apply for the chief's position. Believe me, it wasn't my idea.
drafted...
who exactly drafted you?
the l.A.P.D.Women's coordinator, Captain Raydor.
she was concerned that other female officers From within the department weren't applying.
I need a day to think about this.
what?
I said I need a day to think about this!
considering that I hired you, I brought you here,
and I've backed you up in every confrontation You've provoked over the last five years,
I don't think that's much to ask. Do you?
fine. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
uh, what about my request for narcots officers?
denied.
fine. We'll do what we can.
I certainly hope My inability to conduct this investigation properly Doesn't end up reflecting poorly on you.
chief, I need to talk to you about this cubicle business.
I'll be happy to discuss your workspace with you, commander,
just as soon as I sort out my double homicide. Thanks for understanding.
buzz, have our guests said anything I should care about?
do you have any interest in bronzer, lip gloss, or waxing?
uh, Detective Gabriel, Anything from the canine unit at the condo?
uh, yes...just like in the trailer, the dogs went crazy.
and just like in the trailer, no narcotics were found.
chief, I've gone over all the flight logs From all the trips that Ashley and Linda Worked on during the past two years.
it looks like they flew with Ryan Wade over 90 times.
so much for your girlfriend Barely knowing her dead houseguest.
chief, just because they worked together Doesn't mean that they knew each other.
uh, I mean, y-y-you think I have a clue as to what Buzz does off the clock?
something else, chief.
the morgue went through our dead flight attendant's pockets
and found his key to the trailer.
given that the killer locked the door behind them...
they must have had their own key. Thank you, Detective.
Hey, chief...Jose Coto, the dead guy at the condo?
turns out the feds had a flag on him.
we traded calls with the bureau,
and there's an Agent who would like a word with you.
just one second.
look, no matter what, Ryan Wade didn't shoot himself,
so there's still at least one killer outstanding.
and I want to know everything that those women know.
but, chief, l-look, I-I'm as anxious to close this as you are.
but Ashley and Linda...
these are very respectable ladies.
Flynn, back me up here. - Sure thing.
chief, did we meet these girls yesterday? Absolutely.
do we know them well? I mean, hardly.
I mean, would I stake my reputation on their being on the up-and-up?
no. Is it possible that they... - Way to back me up, Flynn!
and this dead Ryan guy...I mean, he could be mixed up with anybody.
lieutenant, has it even occurred to you
th these women just asked y'all out 'cause they were using you?
What?! That's crazy!
I won't even dignify that with a response!
I know what's what.
and these girls are crazy about us!
is that so hard to believe?
I'm so sorry. I've been running all over,
and I should have called to say that this murder, Which is actually now two murders,
is taking a lot longer than I expected.
Oh, you've only just begun.
meet Miguel Diaz... From Honduras.
he owns a freight business here, Which we suspected was enabling a growing drug operation.
jose Coto...The guy you found last night, also from Honduras...
was one of Diaz's drivers.
now, he shows up dead in a flight attendant's condo,
and suddenly it all makes sense.
Diaz's freight business is a front.
lets him launder money While serving as a decoy for the drug smuggling,
which we now believe is handled by airline personnel.
well, as of today, Diaz has one less operative working for him.
and I got two more down the hall I think are ready to spill.
I'll let you know what I find out.
actually...
honey...
I've been sent here...
to wheedle my way into your investigation.
this is me wheedling.
well, we are shorthanded when it comes to narcotics, but...
would you be helping me solve my case Or would I be helping you solve yours?
is it impossible to think That we could work this out happily together?
probably.
but I'm willing to try. - Oh, well, that's great news.
now, if you really think these two women are involved,
I don't see any rush to break them.
if we hold onto them for a day...
are you asking me to wait a day?
is that a problem? - Yes, it is.
I have a better idea.
we've got orange juice, coffee, sprite.
uh, do you have diet coke? - Uh, will diet Pepsi do?
have they gotten anything out of the girls yet?
no, but the girls have gotten plenty out of them.
Oh, chief, we'll clear this stuff away for you.
uh, actually, lieutenant, I'd appreciate it if y'all would just get out.
get out, get out, get out! Thank you. So much.
well, let me start by saying that my officers Have made some surprising discoveries.
Ashley, you may be amazed to learn That there were drugs in your apartment.
drugs?
y-you mean like drug drugs?
how would drugs get into Ashley's condo?
you think just like a Detective, Linda.
well, I don't know, but I suppose That Ryan could have carried drugs off the plane
and into the condo, taking them with him After killing the man in the bathtub.
does that sound even remotely possible to you?
can I be totally honest with you? - I'd love for you to try.
I don't know Ryan that well.
but I have always been suspicious That he might be some kind of drug mule.
now, why would you let a drug mule Stay in your condo?
well...
he has other positive qualities.
he's really good with the silverware.
and the trash. He keeps the galley spotless.
Mm-hmm, and he's a very reliable phone-message taker.
you mean he was a reliable phone-message taker.
just look at the damn screens, Hmm?
you see, when we went to that awful trailer this morning, We found Ryan.
but he was, unfortunately, dead.
Ryan's dead?
shot four times. Twice in the head.
now, I'm sure if y'all had known Ryan well
that would have made more of an impact, But, still, it must be a little upsetting.
I wonder who might have killed Ryan.
always thinking like a Detective, Aren't you, Linda? Who knows?
as you've seen on the news, The world is a horrible place,
specially for people Who are involved in drug drugs Like Ryan seems to have been.
the way...Have either of you young ladies ever seen th man before?
his name is Miguel Diaz.
he's involved with drugs, money laundering, and worse.
no. - No.
no? - No.
sorry. - Well, that's wonderful.
and since y'all don't know anything at all...
and since there's nothing connecting you To whoever shot Ryan Wade at point-blank range,
y'all are free to go.
wait, wait.
I mean, shouldn't we be protected?
from what?
from the unknown.
from, uh... From whoever killed Ryan.
Oh, people tangled up in drug-mule stuff Like Ryan seems to have been...
those people...They always get what they have coming to them.
you two, on the other hand, should be just fine.
all right. - Well, good luck.
perhaps lieutenants Flynn and Provenza will see you out.
thank you. Thank you so much.
chief! Chief, y-y-you're not gonna make those girls Walk out of here to face god-knows-what.
no, you and lieutenant Flynn Are gonna invite them over to your house.
buzz? I'll get his place wired right away, chief.
as many cameras as you can hide.
consider this your chance To prove that these women weren't just using you.
and if they were? - Use them back.
the only thing I would like about Is there's not enough good Chinese take-out.
well, maybe there aren't enough Jews.
uh, my experience has been That the more Jews, the better the Chinese food.
well, it goes back to Moses, who said, "with ten commandments, you get egg rolls.
I don't get it. - No one ever does.
okay. Here we go.
it's so wonderful of you and Andy to let us stay here tonight.
are you sure if your boss finds out Y'all won't get into any trouble?
not a chance.
when he and I are off the clock, Nobody tells us what to do.
would you go easy on me If you knew I smuggled something off the plane?
tiny wine, anybody?
it goes great with take-out.
none for me, but you go ahead. You scared me there for a second.
so, what's t deal with your boss?
uh, how do you mean exactly?
well, it's like she thinks She's too good for the beauty pageant.
I mean, believe me, being from the South, I know her type.
like when she says, "thank you,
what she's really saying is..."you know where you can stick that!
you know, some women, they just...
they hit that glass ceiling, you know, And they just get so bitter.
dumplings, anyone? Now, these are delicious!
don't pay attention to them.
Oh, please, honestly...do you think I care What a couple of stewardesses say about me?
uh, I think they're called flight attendants now, chief.
we'll get to see how good they look in orange jumpsuits.
excuse me.
Hello?
lieutenant, let's not forget we're here to do something
and that someday this may all get played in court.
no habla espagnol.
Oh, you speak Spanish?
Ah, here we go, oh, beautiful one.
the last sip.
for you.
Oh. Thank you.
it feels so safe being here with you two.
Andy, after you find the person who killed Ryan,
will we still have anything to worry about?
who's to say?
as it is, I don't have a clue Why someone would have killed Ryan in the first place.
do you think that it's possible That we could talk to each other like...
like we're regular people? - Yeah.
I mean, could we just take off our uniforms a minute And trust each other?
girls, listen.
Flynn and I work murders. If this is about...
I don't know...drugs maybe, Believe me, we don't give a damn about that.
well, that guy who you found dead in the tub...
maybe we did know him a little.
how little?
a few years ago, our airline Added a flight from Honduras.
the coffee we brew on the plane comes in sealed bags.
regular has a green dot, decaf has a yellow dot,
and the bags they stocked in Honduras with cocaine Had a white dot.
we just had to make sure That we didn't accidentally open the wrong bag.
after we'd land, we'd take all the white-dot bags
and put them in a big, black trash bag, And we were done.
jose, the guy in my bathtub, Later on, he'd come by with cash.
well, how often was this?
once a month.
then once a week.
then every L.A.Flight connecting from Honduras.
only, over time, the drug people Gave us less and less for doing the exact same thing!
I mean, they said it was the recession, but...
I mean, I don't know.
a girl's got to live, so this week we decided To do something we've never done before.
ever since the airline stopped giving us meals,
we've put our food in little cooler bags.
and yesterday Ryan took all the white-dot packets
and carried it in his bag off the plane for us.
Ryan was supposed to hold onto the drugs
until we could sell them to this contact I made.
only I guess things got complicated for Ryan While we were at dinner.
but you don't have any idea who might have shot him?
no, we only ever dealt with Jose.
nobody else was involved in this?
besides the people in Honduras Who we didn't really know, no.
it was just us.
what we did really isn't that bad, is it?
I mean, Kelly our friend Who washes hair in a hair salon,
she doesn't declare any of her tips.
that is not legal.
chief, you get the sense There's a hole in this story?
big enough to fly a plane through.
we are close to a direct connection With Miguel Diaz, though.
and look at this.
whenever our flight attendants Were on a plane connecting from Honduras,
it was almost always with the same Captain...
a Captain mark Wheeler.
captain Wheeler, I'm Brenda Leigh Johnson From the L.A.P.D. major crimes.
and this is Agent fritz Howard from the FBI.
look, am I under arrest or am I just being questioned?
because your officer read me my rights And then walked off with all my belongings.
I apologize, sir. We ask people to empty their pockets
before interviews for our own security.
a-and you are welcome to leave, But we'd appreciate it if you'd answer a few questions first.
about? - Ryan Wade.
so he did call you guys, then.
he told he was gonna call us?
look, there's this, uh, trailer next to the airport Where some of us stay.
anyway, Ryan burst in on me And launched into this convoluted story
about drugs and smuggling and a guy who was dead.
and, honestly, I didn't know if he was for real
or if this was some sort of psychotic delusion.
so, what exactly did you say to Mr. Wade?
well, that he should go to the police.
did Mr. Wade have drugs with him When he arrived at the trailer?
no, no, he said that he had sold them to somebody else.
that's pretty much all I got from him before I took off.
and you left him in the trailer?
Ryan said he was convinced That these drug people were after him.
so I went to a hotel because, uh, He scared the crap out of me.
well, I'm sorry to inform you, sir,
that we found Ryan Wade yesterday, And he had been shot to death.
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea How Mr. Wade's killer might have found him?
you know, uh, Ryan came in a cab.
so perhaps they followed the cab to the parking lot.
there was no break-in, And the trailer door was locked when we discovered the body.
who else besides you and Mr. Wade have a key?
well, obviously, the owner. - And that would be?
it's one of the women we fly with...
ashely Rogers has two homes in LA. We found bodies in both of them.
Provenza sure can pick 'em.
chief, Wheeler said that Ryan arrived by taxi.
uh, but we checked, and none of the cab companies Had a pick-up during that time
going from Ashley's condo to the airport.
well, Ryan Wade didn't walk to that trailer. And I'm betting he didn't fly.
he may not have had to, chief.
Ashley Rogers has a car registered in Texas
that's been collecting parking tickets here in L.A.
it's not in the condo's garage. It's not on the surrounding streets.
I'm betting Wade took it.
so, Ashley didn't tell us about the car...
captain Wheeler lied to us About how Wade got to the trailer.
kind of makes you wonder what else those two aren't telling us.
well, I don't know, But I think starting a family argument might help us find out.
detective Sanchez, May I see Captain Wheeler's personal effects?
why didn't you tell us you had a car?
you never asked!
and I didn't know it was missing.
and Ryan knew I wasn't insured for an additional driver,
so if he took it without my permission, that's theft.
and if Captain Wheeler says that he didn't know about this,
well, then, he is the biggest lying liar ever.
he came to us with the idea.
I bet all that cocaine Ryan had is still in my car.
and somebody's got to get it Before the drug people come for us.
Ryan probably parked it in the personnel lot.
someone should check. We will, believe me.
uh, there's just one more thing I want to know.
and I want an honest answer.
did the two of you agree to go out with me and Flynn
because you thought we could keep you safe till you got rid of the drugs and left town?
well, not only.
but maybe mainly.
Yeah, this is Flynn. Get me the chief. Thanks.
so what you're saying is...
you were never really attracted to us.
not so much.
but I'm sure other women are.
like, if you ever came to Dallas, My mama would go out with you in a heartbeat.
Oh, mine too!
so, they say that the Captain was behind the whole thing.
thank you, lieutenant. Arrest them, refresh their memories about their rights,
and get them down here as quickly as possible.
you got it, chief. See you in about 20 minutes.
all right, you two, I want you to get your stuff. We're going downtown right now.
come on.
what?
are you upset about those two?
forget about them. They're criminals.
and they're not the only two flight attendants out there.
I think we just chose the wrong airline.
chief... I went through all the keys, and none are for the trailer.
thank you so much, Detective Sanchez.
so sorry to keep you in a holding pattern, Captain Wheeler.
seems we're always behind schedule around here. You know what that's like.
there's so much you can tell about a person from what they carry around in their pocket, Don't you think?
for example, looking at this, I'd think that you grew up on a farm...
or maybe you just have a thing for cheese.
am I close?
those aren't my car keys. - Aren't they?
Oh, w-who do they belong to?
the woman you implied earlier Was responsible for the murder of Ryan Wade? That Ashley?
Yes, that Ashley.
how is it that you have Ashley Rogers' car?
I borrowed it. - Oh, that's easy enough to confirm.
detective Gabriel, would you please get Ashley Rogers on the line?
uh, oh, no, okay, look. I didn't mention it before
because I didn't want to complicate things,
but I got Ashley's car from Ryan.
and that would complicate things how?
what, because if we would have known about the car,
we would have gone and looked for it And found the cooler full of narcotics inside
with your fingerprints on it?
mark Wheeler, you are under arrest For the murder of Ryan Wade.
let's go. - Wait a minute! I didn't kill Ryan!
Really? That's not how it looks to me.
and that's not how it's gonna look to a jury, either.
but, wait a minute... I-I-I'm telling you That...
that when I left... when I left that trailer, Ryan was fine.
Where's your key to the trailer?
what? - Your key.
you were in the trailer when Ryan got there, So you must have had a key.
where is it?!
do you have any idea what is going on out there?!
Mr. Wheeler!
it used to be when people saw me coming, That they would stand to attention.
I was... I was one notch below an astronaut.
now... I'm barely a bus driver.
I get it, Captain Wheeler. Your glory days are over.
who did you give the key to?
I'm arresting someone today for the murder of Ryan Wade.
it's either going to be you Or whoever you gave that key to!
I did not give that key to anyone.
I left that key outside the door... For Miguel Diaz.
and did you also leave the drugs for Mr. Diaz?
you know something? Ryan killed his guy with a bat!
do you think t-that returning the cocaine... That was gonna save his life?!
so you figured they were gonna kill him anyway,
so why not just take the dope and make the most of things?
where are the drugs now, Mr. Wheeler?
as far as I know, they're... they're in Ashley's car.
and where did you tell Mr. Diaz they were?
I told him that I didn't know...
that I'd look for them.
well, then...
you're gonna call Mr. Diaz.
you're gonna tell him you found them.
Hey!
Hey, let's pick it up in there, will ya?!
look, we'll go downtown and we'll sort this out.
Yeah.
Yeah, and everyone will see we're a couple of idiots.
it's had to know how we could look any stupider.
what the...
is that your car?!
Yeah. Yeah, but the joke's on them!
I'm nearly out of gas!
they're going to the airport personnel lot.
please tell me that you are not calling the chief.
I'm calling a cab.
detective Sanchez? - Ready, chief.
I can see Ashley's car. - Lieutenant tao?
all set, chief.
okay, just make the exchange... Drugs for the money and key...
and walk.
we've got you covered from all sides.
what in the hell?
Hey! Stop!
that's not yours!
keep going! Keep going! - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
we see you!
stop that cart!
police!
put your hands up!
get 'em up! Get 'em up!
this is not good.
go! Go!
chief, 9-mill.
you guys got all this under control?
Yes, lieutenant. Thank you so much.
good.
now where the hell is my car?!
Where's my car?!
Hey, you skanks! Bring me my car!
Buh-bye! Have a nice day, now!
Buh-bye! See ya again real soon!
thank you so much! - No, thank you!
Ah, that didn't work out so badly, did it?
closed two murder cases and broke a narcotics ring.
and spent more time together in the past two days Than all of last month.
happy happy. - Don't stay too late.
and good luck with pope, huh?
Oh, commander Taylor! I love what you've done with the space!
well, chief, you know, it may not look it, But...
but square-foot-wise, It... it's bigger than my old office.
do you have a minute?
Yeah, I've been meaning to find you, actually, To offer my congratulations.
thank you.
and to say I thought about what we discussed earlier,
and, uh, I think you should definitely Submit your application for chief of police.
I'm only sorry I didn't recognize that yesterday.
are you? - Yeah, it seems obvious now.
I mean, there should be a high-ranking female From within the department applying.
and, uh, if there's gonna be a woman in the candidate pool,
better it be you than somebody else.
a-a-and that's because?
well, your presence will help deter other women from applying.
and, you know, you'll be given "serious consideration,
but they'll never hire you as chief in a million years,
so, really, it's perfect for me.
is that so?
what makes you so certain I won't get it?
Brenda, please, you...
you can't even control your own officers.
and Flynn and Provenza were outwitted By a couple of stewardesses.
flight attendants. And they weren't outwitted.
Really? Where are they now?
you know, maybe if you hadn't called them A couple of skanks,
they would have told us where they parked your car.
I'm just saying. Do you think it's possible for you to shut up?!
look to the left. I'll look to the right.
Hey, I'm not the one who started talking to these two broads!
Oh, you're the one that picked them up on that plane!
Oh, no, I was not! - What, are you kidding me?
Oh, every woman you see, you got to go try to pick up!
Hey, no skating inside.
Where's that game thing I bought you?
I left it at home 'cause I didn't know you were gonna take me out of camp.
camp?
you have him in camp?!
not anymore.
what?
Hey, kid. Hi.
Yeah. Listen up. Uh...
look, I want you to go over there with Buzz, and he's gonna pull something up on the internet for you to do.
you're bossy. - Get. Huh?
Ruben! I said no skating inside!
look.
e- emergencies happen when you have kids.
well, you don't have kids, Julio.
tao has kids. I have kids.
you have someone else's kid.
that's completely different. W- what's this camp?
it's all-day sports.
I- I just thought that I would find a safe place where Ruben could play all day.
but get this.
the camp's soccer coach was convicted of shoplifting two
wait, wait, wait! Are you
are you telling me that you did an illegal background check on this guy?
no.
his car looked suspicious, so I ran his plates.
Oh, bullshit. - No, I
how stupid do you think I am? - I got to look after this kid until I find his mother!
well, what about finding his mother? Why is that taking you so long?
what's the hold-up? - I don't know.
I'm calling Mexican law enforcement. I'm doing internet searches for family members.
I'm trying everything that I can!
all right.
I, uh...
I think you need some help.
lieutenant Andy Flynn.
major crimes. Need I help you?
Oh, hey, Mikki. How you doing?
is this like... body parts from one person?
body parts?
call the chief.
so, um...
human remains in a bag?
what kind of bag?
give me one second. Okay?
Oh. Thank you, detective Mendoza.
my pleasure, chief.
you are looking better than ever.
Oh. Thank you.
Thanks.
sorry to call you out on something like this, but - I think the circumstances demand it. - What circumstances?
two months ago, a few blocks from here, we found a trash bag in a dumpster with a hacked-up body inside it.
except the head and the hands were missing.
we entered murder details into vicap.
some good matches with some cartel killings in San Diego and Phoenix.
wait. So the cartel filled garbage bags with hacked-up bodies?
without the hands and head?
the hands were there... And the skulls, but the faces had been cut off.
and three weeks ago, we found another bag like this one.
no head. No hands. This one here makes three.
lieutenant Tao, did you find a head in there or some hands?
definitely no head, but not sure about the hands.
okay. - I can do that for you, ma'am.
Oh...that's not necessary.
so, did you take DNA samples from the other bodies?
Yes, ma'am. No hits yet. - Okay.
so, three victims. I assume the others are still at the morgue?
no head, no hands, no funeral service.
so, San Diego, Phoenix, and now Los Angeles.
sounds like the cartel activity is headed north, andthis is gang territory.
is the gang in this neighborhood even connected to cartels?
Where's detective Sanchez? And lieutenant Provenza?
checking onanother missing person. - Still?!
I know the local gang. The six points.
no cartel connections, but maybe they're seen as competition.
Mendoza! Who do you think you are?
excuse me, sir?
you have no authority to transfer cases to major crimes without going throughme.
our watch commander told us to contact you, but no one could find your office.
the clock was ticking. I thought -- - Uh, excuse me, commander. One second.
detective Mendoza, just to be clear, in the last two months, you found three victims hacked up into pieces and tossed into trash bags in local dumpsters?
Yes, ma'am.
I think it's fair to call this a major crime, commander, don't you?
well ,Yeah. But I should have been the one to tell you, not her.
detective Mendoza, thank you so much for your help. We'll take it from here.
glad to help you, ma'am. And always, good to see you.
thank you.
Oh, by the way, good luck on the chief sweepstakes.
you'd look even better sitting behind the big desk.
and what did she mean by that? - I don't know.
I applied for chief of police. We'll talk about it later.
you applied for chief?
that's not how I should find out about that, either.
right now we should be concentrating on whatiwant to find out. Okay?
uh, lieutenant Flynn, would you please organize a grid search to find the missing body parts from that bag?
the last thing I need is for some dog to show up dragging a head down the middle of the street.
okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
thank y'all so much.
what on earth made you apply for chief? - I told her to.
she was drafted by the l. a.p. d.'s women's work group, and I thought she should go with it.
so now, she's one of the 27 billion other people who have applied for the job, which means I'm not the slam dunk we all hoped I'd be.
and the last thing I need is for hacked-up bodies in garbage bags to be the lead story on tonight's news.
well, lucky for us, the press doesn't care about murders in that neighborhood.
Yeah, and to keep it that way, here's a list of words I'd like to not hear during this investigation
Mexican cartel murders, bag of bones, serial killer.
I don't want these cases sensationalized.
but the m. o. Here is very similar to the Mexican cartel murders.
look, they're called Mexican cartel murders because they happen in Mexico.
as of now, you don't even know where these victims are from, let alone who they are.
meet juan doe 102, 106, and 107.
from what I can tell so far, all of them adolescent males.
I didn't conduct the original autopsy on your other victims, but let me see if I can put something together for you.
do the bodies have any identifying characteristics?
based on their skin color, I would say they were Latino, but I don't want to be accused of racial profiling.
they could be gang members.
no. But...
no. I don't see tattoos.
so, what -- you're saying there's -- there's nothing.
Oh. Not so fast.
I looked over the x-rays from the first victim that mendoza brought in a couple of months ago, and I found something the other doctor missed.
what is that?
a radiolucent ankle pin, made from material easy to miss on an x-ray.
fda just approved it last year, and it's not the kind of medical treatment you're likely to find in Mexico yet.
okay, and which suggests that at least one of our victims is fromhere.
thank you, doctor.
all I need is for one of these missing persons reports to mention a broken ankle or -- or a twisted foot or something.
are you done eating yet?
because these autopsy photos of the victims from San Diego and Phoenix arebad.
trust me -- After what I saw today, nothing will faze me.
look, why -- why don't...
you start sorting through these missing persons files, and I'll start sorting through these?
what is that?! - What?
Oh, that's a soccer ball with one of the victim's faces stitched onto it.
an fbi source gave us that photo after the ball was found rolling around city hall in Juarez.
detective Mendoza didn't say anything about that.
what did Sanchez say about the gangs in the area?
Sanchez wasn't there.
he's still allegedly looking for Ruben's mom.
might have been easier for him if I hadn't killed the kid's dad.
any way I can help?
talk to Provenza about it. Would you? Please?
I'm staying out of it, if I can.
what's that? - Missing 17-year-old boy.
there's a little box checked there, indicating a scar on his ankle.
his name is Pedro Mota. Reported missing 10 days ago by his mother.
the body was found in six points gang territory.
but this is detective Mendoza's first victim, picked out of the trash two months ago. Why'd his mother wait so long to call it in?
maybe she thought Pedro was in jail. He has the ? sum?
last year, Pedro was arrested in the gang rape of a 12-year-old girl.
for some reason, she couldn't testify, so Pedro walked.
Charmin'.
well, maybe I should
maybe I should talk to this mother.
I had her picked up, chief. She should be here any second.
well, that'sonemother you found awfully quick.
thank you, lieutenant.
chief, if this is a gang or a cartel thing and Pedro is the victim, - then something's weird. - And what would that be?
well, the six points deal prescription drugs -- Oxycontin, vicodin, percocet.
they stay away from cartel product. No coke and no pot.
whatever Pedro's done, it's not my fault.
Mrs. Mota?
thank you so much for coming in.
I'm deputy chief Johnson. Why don't we go into my office to talk?
detective Sanchez? Detective Gabriel?
right this way.
you know, I can't believe she didn't mention the whole "chief" thing.
well, it's -- It's all politics. Which means we're not gonna get involved.
I don't want to hear another word about this from anybody. I- is that clear?
you're not even gonna ask her about it?
no. And neither are you.
we have enough problems around here as it is.
I don't care if you find Pedro or not.
things are better without him.
then why did you file a missing persons report?
the money. - What money?
that nosy welfare lady showed up again, unannounced, doing her little inspection.
she asked where Pedro was, and I mentioned I haven't seen him in a while.
so the bitch threatens to cancel my monthly check if I don't report him missing?!
she's like, "he's only a teenager. He shouldn't be gone like this.
so, I called the police.
now I, like, still get my check, and I don't have to look at Pedro's stupid face.
and when was the last time you saw your son's "stupid face"?
I don't know.
right after school ended. Something like that.
that was two months ago. You didn't think that was worth mentioning to the police?
Oh, look. I tried to make good with Pedro, but he don't listen.
I'm not dealing with his crap no more!
so what do you think happens to this welfare check if your son turns up dead?
dead?
Pedro wasn't dead. He was just...
bleeding a little.
what do you mean "bleeding"?
he got into some stupid knife fight, and I had to stop everything I was doing to take him to that clinic.
would this be the same clinic where he got a pin put in his ankle?
how'd you know about that? - I- I need the name of this clinic, please.
Pedro Mota. Um, yeah, yeah, I did.
I treated him just for a knife wound.
and there was something odd about it, too. I- I can't remember what it was.
is Pedro a regular patient here?
see, I'm also interested in a pin that may have been put into his ankle.
and I understand you have to comply with hipaa regulations.
so I brought this, as well as the patient's mother.
Yeah, um, can we discuss this privately, please?
of course. - Thank you.
please.
uh, Eva, can you pull up for me, uh, pedro mota's medical chart, please? Thanks.
you never reported Pedro's knife wound to the police.
this is a volunteer clinic in a tough neighborhood.
I- I call the police, and my car won't be here when I leave.
doctor? Pedro Mota's file. - Uh, thanks. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah, he did.
he had a nasty cut on the right side of his torso, just above his liver.
you said there was something odd about the wound?
you know, it looked to me as if his mom might have had a go at him.
an attempt at attitude adjustment?
did you ask him about that? - No, I-I've learned
Hi. I've learned not to be overly curious with the teenagers here. They, um, - they can take it the wrong way. - Right.
it was a really nasty cut, though. I made a follow-up for him, um, but...
he never came back? - No.
you know, and every time I called, his mom hung up on me.
chief?
ma's getting antsy out here.
Oh. Uh, just one second.
um, you know, I...
I really don't want the mom to know that I've been
Oh. Don't worry about her. I'm not gonna tell her anything.
um, what about pedro's ankle? Is there a pin in it?
right. Um...
Yes. And it was put there by our orthopedic surgeon -- It was last year.
Dr. Scott.
well, he's not in today. Do you want me to call him?
uh, no, I-if I could just take the x-ray of the ankle, if you have that?
Yeah. - As well as Pedro's chart.
I'm trying to identify his body. - Um, yes.
here is the x-ray and, um, the chart. - Oh, thank you.
I can also get you Pedro's dental records. Wouldn't that be better in terms of
dental records won't help in this instance. I mean, the whole face
uh, the chart will do! Thank you so much, doctor.
definitely a match.
did you happen to see a scar on Pedro's torso, from a knife wound, maybe?
not on the left side.
and the right side of his abdomen was missing, along with a lot of other things.
like what?
your three victims also had a few organs removed.
organs? What organs?
when I started examining what was left of these bodies last night,
I noticed the first one we identified here -- Pedro
had a kidney and a liver missing.
maybe also a heart -- Although I don't have that part of his body.
but his head and his hands were also gone.
so I didn't know if that meant anything.
then this morning, I started in on the second bag of bones.
no organs.
a- and the body from yesterday?
heart, liver, kidneys -- All gone.
doctor, are you telling me you think these boys were murdered for their organs?
officially, the cause of death is still undetermined.
but...
I've -- I've looked very closely at all three bodies.
and...
the Internal organs are empty.
nothing in Mexico.
Yes, sir?
Where's Ruben?
he's in the break room watching television. He's not in the way.
any progress on finding his mother?
um, well, sir...
Ruben says she's from Manzanillo.
my uncle has a close friend there who did some digging around.
no trace of a Maria Hernandez...yet.
but I'm trying new searches every day.
well...
let's see what these, uh, searches of yours have...
turned up.
you dumped my computer, Tao?
I'm trying to help you, Julio.
you haven't been trying to find Ruben's mother.
you've been trying to find babysitters and new day camps and schools for the fall.
there's not a single search here for a Maria Hernandez. Not one.
we dragged your office phone logs.
you have not called Mexico once... In two weeks.
now you listen to me, Julio.
Ruben deserves to be with his mother, and his mother deserves to be with him.
she had four years to come back, and she hasn't done it.
Julio, you don't even know her.
she's not here, tao!
Hey, what else do I need to know?! - She was deported by an ice agent who was a...
a murdering rapist! - She was probably too afraid to come back!
when you have a child, you find a way!
no.
Ruben's better off with me and my family.
and I am not giving him back.
all right, Tao.
check it out with Ruben.
if it's true, then we've got a starting point, and it'll get easier from there.
how do we get her back into the country?
well, I've got that covered.
what if Julio's right?
I mean, how do we know what's best for Ruben?
we're following the law.
that'show we know what's best.
chief, we got aDNA hit on the second victim.
did you get a name? - No, but I matched some open case files.
dead guy number two left a baseball cap at the scene of a robbery last year.
and then two months ago, he cut his arm on a glass door after killing a security guard.
okay, so our first bag of bones contains a child-molesting rapist, and the second one holds a murdering armed robber.
sounds like someone is doing the city a favor.
with what Dr. Morales told us, maybe it's a sign that gangs are getting into the organ-selling business.
Yeah, you know, chief, I was doing some research.
a kidney can go for over $10, 000 on the black market.
a heart is off the charts.
I mean, ounce for ounce, it's better than dealing cocaine.
what are you guys talking about? These are gangsters.
they're not interested in organs, and they're not doing brain surgery on the side, either.
it's only a theory, Julio!
well, your theory's stupid, Tao! - Hey, that's lieutenant Tao!
you knock it off! And I mean it.
okay, so, the autopsy results from the San Diego and Phoenix bodies show the organs still in place.
so, our murders aren't connected to them.
and I think detective Sanchez has a point.
I seriously doubt that local gang members have the resources or the knowledge to start trading kidneys and such on the black market.
but who does? That is the question. Who does?
the organ distribution network is pretty strictly regulated.
now, each state has a federally designated organ procurement organization, an o. p.o. now, each time they harvest, they report to the united network for organ sharing, who in turn tell them where to send the hearts, the livers, and stuff.
the whole system is actually designed to keep track of every single organ.
well, clearly...
it's not working very well, is it?
so, the o. p.o. Here in California -- Does it have a name?
life group alliance, like all o. p.o.'s, is a non-profit organization.
it's against the law for anyone to sell us organs.
well, I appreciate that it's against the law, Ms. Reid, but most killers don't care about that.
besides which, you can't just place any heart into any body.
donors have to be matched with recipients.
you people.
you never do anything but make things harder on us.
harder in what way?
let's start with a potentially great source for healthy organs -- Homicide victims.
well, a murder victim's organs might be used as evidence.
and the guidelines under whichweoperate -- Guidelinesaren't laws.
the police aren't compelled to keep those organs.
and patients die because you don't give them to us.
ms. Reid, so far I've got three victims who have been murdered and cut up for parts.
and if this case requires it, trust me,
I will hold back every organ I can find, including thoseyou'resupposed to be monitoring.
life group alliance could not be involved.
we have an elaborate set of checks and balances to prevent undocumented organs from entering our system.
wait.
so are you saying there is no way to get a transplant without waiting in this line of yours?
well, it would have to go through our database, but there are directed donations.
people who want to donate a kidney or bone marrow to specific patients.
it's rarer, but there are some angels among us.
my victims didn't have wings.
so this database of yours -- It would include everyone who's out there searching for an organ donor? Is that correct?
I suppose you want to see who's on that list.
no, Ms. Reid. I want to see whoisn't.
what are you doing?
we're cross-referencing a database of people who were looking for transplants in southern California two months ago.
and eliminating those still waiting today.
Why?
because kidneys, livers, and especially hearts don't last very long.
so whoever took those organs from our victims had to transplant them pretty quickly.
and those people wouldn't still be on the waiting list.
all right. Here we go.
over the last two months, a total of 319 people fell off the list.
74 of them died before getting a transplant, eliminatingthem.
okay, so that leaves 245 people in the L. A. Area who received organs.
38 of whom were recipients of direct donors.
okay, so let's look 48 hours on either side of the day that Pedro was found.
we need to find someone who matches him pretty closely.
how about Oscar Garcia, age 16?
roughly the same age as Pedro Mota.
same ethnicity. Oscar got a kidney.
okay, uh, lieutenant Flynn, would you please bring oscar down here and a parent?
so, if you've identified your first victim, why haven't you notified his mother yet?
she waited over a month to report him missing.
she's in no rush to know anything.
and what...
what is the matter now?
I asked you not to sensationalize this case.
now you're making it look like people are being hunted down in the streets of l. a. For their organs.
if this Oscar kid has a stolen kidney, what are you gonna do -- Ask for it back?
thank you for coming in, Mr. Garcia.
we are so low on funds right now that every tank of gas really counts.
w- what is it you think the hospital might have done wrong?
well, um...
hopefully, nothing.
after you, sir. - Thank you.
deputy chief Johnson, this is jorge and Oscar Garcia.
pleased to meet you. - Good morning.
thank you so much for coming in. - pleasure.
thank you for coming.
this is David Gabriel from the state medical board. He's here to help us today.
hopefully, this won't take too long.
we just need to do a follow-up on transplants here in Southern California.
I don't have to tell you how hard these organs are to come by.
and we've had a few complaints, so, better to be safe than sorry.
before we start, Oscar, how are you feeling? You doing all right, Buddy?
I'm doing great. And I felt like that right away, too.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
he's -- He's doing a lot better.
thank god. You'd never know how bad he was before.
no. I wouldn't.
and you were very lucky to find a direct donor.
and just in the nick of time, I understand, too.
now, the local registry lists your donor's name as a...
Sancho Ruiz? Is that correct?
Oscar's second cousin -- On his mother's side of the family.
okay. And does -- does Sancho reside here in Los Angeles?
no. no, no, no, no.
he -- He lives in Mexico.
we'd never even heard of Sancho. Can you believe that?
but when we found him, and it turned out he was a match for me, Sancho said he'd be honored to help.
cause family is family. - Isn't that wonderful?
doing my job, I don't meet a lot of people like Sancho. I can tell you that.
how on earth did y'all find him if no one had ever heard of him before?
ancestry. com.
see, a lot of our extended family still lives in Mexico.
and you contacted Sanchohow?
for example, did you speak with Sancho on the phone?
no. I didn't even know about him until we were headed for surgery.
dad didn't want to get my hopes up.
after we were through it all, I wrote him a letter thanking him.
didn't I, dad?
Really? Where'd you send it?
the letter, I mean. I mean, what's Sancho's address?
we would all really love to talk with him.
no. - Mr. Garcia...
I need you to give me Sancho's contact information.
these are not follow-up questions to Oscar's surgery.
I mean, what -- what the hell is going on here?
Mr. Garcia, why don't we start over?
only this time, I need to advise you of your rights.
you know what? Don't bother.
cause I am not answering any more questions until I speak to an attorney. Okay?
no, sir, you've been very helpful. Thank you.
great. So Mr. Garcia's lawyer already contacted the hospital where Oscar got his organ transplant.
he threatened him with legal action if they divulge any of the boy's medical history to us.
how about the heads?
have you found any of the heads yet?
I think it would be interesting.
it would, wouldn't it?
detective Sanchez, what about Oscar's so-called cousin, Sancho?
he doesn't exist, period, chief.
Ruben, you don't need to be hearing any of this.
go watch television with Buzz. Buzz!
Oh...
I'd give one of my kidneys to Julio if he needed it.
but Ruben couldn't just give Julio a kidney.
there would have to be some kind of an exam to make sure that they were a good match for each other.
wouldn't they? Uh, where's Pedro Mota's chart from that clinic?
Oh, I have it, chief!
is there any kind of test in there that doesn't go with a knife wound - or a broken ankle? - Well, let's see.
right after the surgery, where the doctor put a pin in his ankle, there's a -- wow
a ct angiogram scan?
now, what would that have to do with -- ooh.
Luminex flow bead dsa determinations.
english, Tao. English.
these are medical assessments used to determine the size and viability of organs for transplant, ordered by a Dr. Navarro.
Dr. Navarro?
but he only volunteers at the clinic. What's his day job?
Dr. Luis Navarro -- surgery and transplant medicine.
admitting privileges, St. Sebastian hospital.
all right. It's gonna be okay.
excuse me. A- are you waiting for Dr. Navarro?
Yes. Yes. I am. Is he here?
uh, not yet, but we expect him any minute.
I've just got a few more questions for you.
Oh, my god. You're kidding me.
they're very basic.
uh, your daughter's name, the organ she's receiving, and how long she's been
Mary Witten, a heart, and she's been waiting for months. Months.
I mean, in fact, we'd almost given up.
and then Dr. Navarro calls us this afternoon, out of the blue, and tells us to get ready.
I hate to think about what some other family is going through right now, but for us -- For us, it's a miracle.
chief. Dr. Navarro's still not -- - Yes, David. I know.
chief? Who are you?
when did Dr. Navarro tell you about the heart?
a couple of hours ago. Why? What's wrong?
excuse me. I'm -- I'm sorry.
no, you can't do anything to interfere with this surgery!
please, sir! This is my daughter's only chance!
keep walking. - What is it?!
why do you want to talk to Dr. Navarro?!
please, tell me! I'm begging you!
please don't do anything to hurt mary!
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Dr. Navarro, put your hands up, and step away from that table!
sorry, I can't do that.
this is a sterile environment. Opening that door could compromise my procedure.
that's the point, doctor.
put your hands in the air and move away from the table, or I'm going to shoot you!
well, aim for my head, would you? I'm an organ donor.
look. This boy is gone.
his brain, such as it was, is dead.
and his heart...
has stopped.
I've already removed his kidneys and liver, so the boy's prognosis is terminal.
please don't try and come in through
Oh, that's plexiglas. If you're gonna start shooting, try not to hurt yourselves.
look. The boy is dead. And there's a numeric code on that door.
so good luck with that.
detective Gabriel, stand on that chair, and check out the body.
a young girl's life depends on what we do here tonight.
you mean Mary Witten?
if these men manage to break in here before I'm finished, she dies.
chief.
that heart's not beating. He's -- the kid's dead, chief. He's dead.
get out your cellphones, gentlemen. I want video of this.
you're in a world of trouble, doctor! - Really?
what kind of trouble are we talking about?
in addition to killing Pedro Mota and removing his organs, we just watched you murder this young man.
are you sure you have a proper cause of death?
because from where I'm standing, it looks like this boy died of a brain hemorrhage.
that's all your medical examiner is gonna find. I promise you.
all right, then, doctor. You want to stall me? I can stall, too.
how long is that heart you've been working on good for?
three hours? Four?
we'll just wait here until you decide to be more forthcoming.
and remember, a young girl's life depends on what we do here tonight.
chief, chief. Look.
this decision is way above my pay grade, but those organs areevidence.
let me handle this my way.
you want Mary Witten to get that heart, you better answer my questions.
I want a list of all the people that you've killed and all of the people who are helping you distribute these organs.
well, you are asking for the wrong lists.
what about the list of all the victims these young men left behind them?
detective Gabriel, call for back-up. I want this door knocked down now!
wait! Please.
I'll talk to you.
just promise me that Mary Witten will get her heart.
all right. You answer my questions truthfully, and I'll see what I can do about your patients.
how many people have you operated on like this?
Miguel here makes five.
now, the first one was a homicide victim from six points. I couldn't save him.
but he looked like he might be a match for a patient of mine, so I kept him alive long enough to make sure.
and then I took his liver to save another's life.
and I found myself inspired.
now, I really don't expect you to appreciate the difficulty of what I'm doing here, but there are not that many doctors who could single-handedly
how'd you get around the double-blind system to direct this heart to Mary Witten?
well, that was forgery, and friends from the 11 transplant hospitals all over Southern California who are exhausted from watching decent people die every day...
I need names, doctor, not a sermon!
everyone helping me thinks I'm giving them organs from homicide victims.
doctor, you are!
you are still stalling, doctor. I can play this game all night!
how long can Mary Witten play it?
on my laptop behind you, there's a file with every name that you want, including the precise measurements of all my potential recipients and their donors.
other donors? You're planning to do this to other people?!
two more. Yes.
so you started out using someone else's murder victim, but that's not how Pedro Mota came to be here.
Pedro Mota had a knife wound, like you were told.
but he had been here before after breaking his ankle.
Yes.
led the gang rape of a 12-year-old girl.
her mother came home from work to find in her backyard six teenage boys taking turns on her only child.
but while she was calling 911, she noticed one of them hurt himself, limping away.
so, while I was treating her daughter for...
for unspeakable things, who should walk into our clinic with a broken ankle?
you know, with the proper anesthetic, I made Pedro extremely talkative.
so, before he was transformed into a useful member of society, he gave me the names of all his little rapist friends.
and this ax?
it was necessary to the...
to the post-op procedure I used to make these boys look like cartel victims.
my hope wasto misdirect you.
once I knew you had Pedro's chart, I knew I was running out of time.
I'm still running out of time.
and this victim -- He -- he was also part of that gang rape?
victim?
all right.
Yes. He was.
I called Miguel to tell him that he might have been exposed to an std.
and while he was here complaing about the neighborhood whores,
I stuck a needle in his arm.
now, I really shouldn't have to explain to law-enforcement professionals how that works.
I don't understand. Why didn't you just call the police?!
you don't understand because you didn't struggle to save a little girl's life!
watch her head swell to twice its size!
she can't even identify her own mother anymore,
let alone the six teenage animals who mutilated her!
you know, there was no DNA on her.
and I checked everywhere. Therewasn'tany.
call the poli-- " what were you gonna do?!
you're not in charge out here!
Where's the line for you, doctor?
you start by cutting up people you think committed rape, and who's next?
drug dealers? Thieves?
people who cross against the light?
listen to me.
there are two really bad boys out there that I didn't get to.
why don't you give me a year?
see what happens.
I can make this place safer thanyoucan.
who gave you the right to play god?
the position was vacant.
so I took it.
now...
I've done my end of the bargain. I've fully confessed.
will Mary Witten get her heart?
or will you keep it... as evidence?
well, well.
look who's playing god now.
we can arrest all of Navarro's accomplices if you want, but I'm not sure the D. A.Will press charges against anyone except him.
that's not our decision to make.
we made lots of decisions that weren't ours to make.
so you would have brought the heart in and booked it as evidence?
at least we know where it is.
uh, yes, Fritzi. - where are you?
uh, still at the hospital, waiting to see if the heart takes. Where areyou?
walking towards your office.
I have Ruben's mother with me.
well, it had to be done.
just, uh, watch out for Julio for me, would you?
let me know how it goes. - I will.
okay.
I'm telling you, Julio. You can't just pick it up and expect to win.
if you want to master this game, you gotta practice, or I'll beat you every time.
ma! Ma!
meet Maria Hernandez.
tao tracked her down outside Loreto.
agent Howard arranged to have her flown up.
this is a good thing, Julio.
thank you. Gracias.
thank you, Julio.
thank you for finding my mother.
sure.
sure.
you be good to her, okay? That's your mom.
go on.
Julio, I thought you left.
um, I'm not married.
do you have a boyfriend?
no.
well, then, um, how would you and Ruben like to have dinner with me?
I'm sure agent Howard has other plans.
I do.
thank you.
you're gonna like Julio, mom.
he took me to the firing range with him, and he shot a bull's-eye from over a thousand feet away,
Oh, these screens again. Buzz!
it's not me.
it's fraud downstairs.
our remotes use the same signal.
if you'd just let me change the frequency - No!
fraud can change their remote.
but they won't.
well, the signal shouldn't be able to go through the floor or walls, anyway, Buzz.
there's a design flaw in this part of the building.
Yeah. Uh, lieutenant Provenza, major crimes.
I want to speak to whoever's in charge down there.
good evening. L.A.P.D. Major crimes. Detective Gabriel.
buzz, where's the mushroom pizza?
there's nothing here that's vegetarian. - I'm sorry, ma'am. There's no detective Erico here.
they were out of mushrooms, so I got you a pizza with bell peppers on it instead.
bell peppers? - Guys, I can't hear.
when have you ever seen me eat a bell pepper? - Hello?
it's a vegetable! - Ma'am, are you in some kind of trouble?
guys! Would you shut up, please?
Hello? Ma'am? Are you still there?
there's somebody in my house. There's somebody here.
o - okay, ma'am. You know what? Give me your name and address.
and we'll get someone over to you right away.
I need detective Erico.
okay. Uh, detective Erico.
Erico! Guys.
anyone ever hear of this Erico?
ma'am, we're searching for detective Erico.
but right now, I need you to tell me where you are.
what's your address?
Oh, no. You won't get here soon enough.
I'm in trouble now!
ma'am ... - There's somebody here.
I have to go get my gun. - All right. Ma'am, just...
okay, just stay calm and tell me your address.
look, I can't talk louder.
if I can just get to my gun...
Erico? Anyone? Anything?
no Erico here.
maybe a different spelling.
okay, ma'am, stay calm, okay? - My gun -- my gun is gone!
it's -- it's not here! Oh, my go...
Hello? Hello? Ma'am, are you there?
Hello? Damn it!
we got to get her back.
we got to get her back right now!
her phone line is blocked.
so unless she calls us back, there's nothing we can do.
except find detective Erico!
why couldn't you guys find detective Erico?
she might've been running the two words together.
there's a detective "Verico," with a "v,
works threat management.
stalking cases.
tao, yeah, let's get this detective Verico up here with his open case files.
Where's chief Johnson?
she's in an interview with some police commissioners downstairs.
somebody should run down, pass her a note about what's going on.
detective Verico's got the week off.
they said it's gonna take at least an hour before they bring his case files up here.
give me that.
this is commander Taylor.
I want Verico's cases, and I need lights and sirens headed to every female on his list of stalking victi Ms. Right now.
everything to the rear of the residence is clear. Nobody home.
copy that.
same with the front rooMs. There's nothing here.
all clear on the second floor!
Yeah, we got nothing down here, either.
I'm very sorry for the intrusion.
I hope you understand.
we, uh, we just have to check these things out sometimes.
not a problem -- Really.
clear! Clear the door!
16863. I have a female down inside my location.
gunshot wound. She does not appear to be breathing.
roll paramedics. And advise major crimes we found their victim.
43 years old.
single. Lived alone.
she dialed my extension by mistake little over two hours ago looking for detective Verico, who works in threat management.
ms. Ross was shot once in the right temple area.
the bullet entered and exited, hitting the wall over there by Sanchez.
judging by what looks to be a. 40 caliber casing over here on the floor, the weapon was fired from somewhere around...here.
we found a. 40 caliber hand gun in a trash can behind the house.
it might be her weapon.
we're checking the registration right now.
box cutter?
with a broken blade.
think maybe she used that to try and fend off her attacker?
maybe, chief.
but look at this.
she was shot.
and her throat was cut.
Yeah, the, uh, throat injury happened postmortem.
if someone had severed her jugular while she was still alive...
we'd be walking in blood.
any idea how the killer got in?
no.
and, uh, there's no sign of forced entry.
now, there are three doors to the house.
the front door, which was dead-bolted and chain-locked from the inside -
uh, before we breached it.
and this door leads to the garage, which was locked when we got here.
and the electric garage door is shut.
and the back door is the only other exit.
no chain but dead-bolted.
also, all the windows were barred and locked.
so there was no way for the killer to enter or exit.
Yeah, it's kind of like a crime scene and a magic trick.
Hey, I found the tip to that box-cutter blade.
must have snapped off when the, uh, cord to this phone was cut.
all right, then. We know how this conversation ended.
let's go back to how it began.
ms. Ross called my desk.
I thought she was asking for a detective Erico
not Verico.
and she said someone was in her house.
she need to get her gun.
she said it was in her nightstand, back in her bedroom, I guess.
someone's in my house! Someone's here!
I can't speak louder.
somebody's in my house. I have to get my gun.
my gun is not here! It's gone!
should be in my nightstand.
ms. Ross spoke to you from here.
while she was searching for her weapon, yeah.
there's no door out of the house from here.
and the windows are barred.
maybe she made a run for it?
chief, this is detective Frank Verico from threat management.
sorry it took me so long to get here.
I'm off this week.
thank you for coming, detective.
any idea how all this happened?
no.
but twice I tried to convince the commissioner she need police protection -- She wouldn't take it.
excuse me.
uh, did you just refer to our victim as 'commissioner'?
Yes, I did.
headed the California state parole board.
and why did you think commissioner Ross need protection?
did it have something to do with a prisoner she refused to release?
I'm not sure.
there was no verbal or written threat.
but about a month ago, she stopped on her way home from work for a doctor's appointment.
and while her car was parked, someone broke into it.
and how did that become your problem?
patrol called me in because the commissioner's a high-ranking state official.
you know, to be honest,
I thought what happened to her vehicle was more like vandalism than anything else.
why do you say that?
because nothing was stolen from her car and she had cash and credit cards in her console.
I suggested she get police protection just in case.
commissioner turned me down flat.
didn't think it was worth the cost.
neither did I, really.
until someone broke into her home.
you mean before tonight?
Yes, ma'am.
last Wednesday.
she called and said somebody had been in her house while she was at work.
maybe that's why someone broke into her car -- To get her home address.
no. If they knew which car was hers, they could've just followed her home.
hold off on the car for a minute.
we've just been through commissioner Ross' house, and it's all but hermetically sealed.
detective, do you have any idea how someone could have slipped through the bars on her windows and the locks on her doors -- Twice?
no.
and, just like her car, she said nothing was stolen from her residence.
and before you ask me why someone would burglarize her car and her home and not take anything,
I don't know -- Neither did she.
where is everybody?
excuse me?
have you even notified the sheriff's department yet?
do we have protection in place for the other members of the parole board?
you should at least have gang support down here reviewing the case.
look, before we do all that, I'm getting a few facts here.
you want facts? Here's a fact.
the head of a state law-enforcement agency was murdered while on the phone with major crimes!
that's a fact!
that's not their fault, chief.
the commissioner mixed up the last two digits of my work phone and got detective Gabriel instead of me.
you're Verico?
Yes, sir.
you were the lead investigator into these threats against commissioner Ross?
uh, excuse me, but there were no actual threats.
well, she's dead.
and she was murdered when the l.A.P.D.
had an open case with her name on it.
so obviously, she was under some sort of a threat.
while we figure that out, detective Verico,
I think it would be in the best interest of the department if you just, uh, continue with your week off.
how does this happen?
how does major crimes take a call from this woman -
sir -- sir, I can explain.
you can explain why -- why not one officer, not one patrol car was dispatched to -
to the commissioner's house until after she was murdered -
you can explain that?!
I tried to get her... - Okay, excuse me. Excuse me!
chief pope, Can we talk in my office for a moment?
thank you very much.
look, Danielle Ross was on the phone for less than a minute with us before the line went dead.
she never identified herself or gave her address.
okay Even if that's true, the l.A.P.D. Knew that commissioner Ross' safety was at risk before she was gunned down in her home!
all right, look. Here's what I need you to do.
I need you to launch a thorough investigation of every inmate who's been denied parole for the last six mon -
make -- make it a year... - Uh, hold on. Hold on.
will, asking me to stop what I'm doing now - may end up slowing down our process. - Slow down?!
Brenda, I don't think you get this!
we're so far behind now, I don't -- I don't know if we can catch up!
how did this happen?
look, Will, for your own sake, just take a deep breath, okay?
I- I know you're feeling some extra pressure because of this whole chief business
so now, on top of everything else, you're accusing me of overreacting?
you want to know what I think?
I think your own reaction to this case has been slow, unimpressive, and potentially dangerous to the rest of the parole-board members in the state.
okay! That's it!
you don't like the way I'm handling this case, that's just fine.
you should just take it over yourself.
you know what? That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
swift justice.
what a ridiculous name.
and all these people Pope's brought in to.
watch him throw everything the department has at this murder.
and they're all from law enforcement, so maybe they'll end up helping us.
they're not gonna end up helping Pope.
if he thinks we really made some kind of mistake with commissioner ross, he just announced it to the whole state.
and then asking us to review everyone up for parole over the past year -
that's a complete waste of time.
well, look, maybe not.
I got an interesting fax from the warden at Folsom this morning.
he's got a prisoner -- Tomas Medina.
commissioner Ross denied him release just two months ago.
he's serving time for a murder-for-hire.
and he's implying that he put a hit out on the commissioner.
you didn't tell Pope about this, did you?
no. No.
I don't want him to do anything too hasty.
believe me, I know exactly what we're up against here.
I'm doing everything I can to conduct this investigation so it doesn't blow up in our faces.
excuse me.
uh, chief Pope wants you.
Oh. Okay. Thanks.
well, if it does blow up, be aware.
it's set to explode in your murder room.
Pope isn't the only one who needs to watch his back.
Thanks.
I guess you have a good reason for not telling me about Medina.
who?
currently serving the 20th year of a 30-year sentence at Folsom for hiring a busboy at his restaurant to off his wife.
the warden at Folsom contacted you this morning after searching Medina's cell and finding articles about the commissioner, the last of which had a photo with the word "dead" scrawled across her face.
please don't pretend any of this is news to you.
I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out how you know all this.
I'm being copied on all information on this case.
and I've ordered air support to fly Medina down from Folsom.
he should be here by 2: 00 p. m. Today. - What?!
you can't do that!
I know next to nothing about him.
well, then educate yourself.
because with state police and sheriff's deputies and state prison officials here helping swift justice, we need equal emphasis on "swift.
this is not the way to handle this, Will.
it just isn't.
all right, can you say for sure that commissioner Ross' murder was an attack against her and her alone and that the rest of the state parole board is in no danger whatsoever?
because unless you can state that with absolute certainty, time may not be on our side.
now, Medina is coming.
and ready or not,
I need you to talk to him.
okay, lieutenant Provenza, I want you to search all crime reports where a box cutter was used as a weapon and see if there's a connection to Tomas Medina.
and until Mr. Medina arrives
don't worry, chief.
I'll keep Pope distracted.
thank you so much.
uh, detective Sanchez, lieutenant Flynn,
I want to know everything there is to know about Mr. Medina.
friends, family, associates.
we'll get a morgue report while we're at it. - Thank you.
lieutenant Tao, please examine commissioner Ross' personal and work computers.
maybe there are threats on there she didn't let detective Verico know about.
detective Gabriel, I'd like to speak to detective Verico.
so would I, chief, but he's not answering his phone.
no, I don't mean call him.
I want to speak to him in person.
the way Pope sent him home, that's going to be tough.
Hey, chief, considering how swamped our office is, you have some idea where you'd like us to regroup?
detective Verico, thank you for coming.
why don't you have a seat?
Yeah, let's, uh, have a seat and we can all chat about what happened yesterday.
how about I sit when I'm ready?
because if you asked me here to go over everything I did wrong again, you can talk to my union rep.
detective, we asked you here because we could really use your help.
listen, when I spoke to commissioner Ross, the only person she wanted to talk to was you.
she was in trouble, and it was you she was reaching out to.
I called her every other day, you know?
just to make sure she was all right.
I even helped her get the locks on her house changed.
I'm sure you did everything you could, detective.
please sit down.
come on, Frank.
you know why it took me so long to get to her house the night she was shot?
because almost the entire l.A.P.D. Is seven days on, seven days off.
how am I supposed to look out after people if the budget determines when I can work?
maybe if the right person becomes chief, our budget priorities will turn for the better.
uh, detective Verico, the other night you told me that Danielle Ross thought her house had been broken into a week before she was murdered.
since nothing was stolen, what made her so sure of that?
seemed to her like someone had gone through her mail.
uh, closet light was left on.
but what really convinced her was the smell of gardenias.
specifically in her bedroom.
Gardenia? You mean like the flower -- gardenia?
like a perfume.
it wasn't much to go on, but I printed the entire house anyway, questioned neighbors.
and, again,
I contacted state police and urged her to accept protection.
but she refused.
Yeah.
I don't know what I missed.
come on, Frank.
I'll take you home.
thank you so much for coming.
did you find out yet how someone broke into her house and why nothing was stolen?
uh, something was stolen, detective.
she was shot to death with her own gun.
but -- but she didn't even know it was missing until she went looking for it.
so I did miss something.
come on, man.
lieutenant Tao!
No! No people food for Joel!
I'm sorry, chief.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
what do you think you're doing?
what do you think you're doing, huh?
no begging.
go on, now. Go on, you little smushy-smush!
okay, lieutenant. What'd you find out?
no threats and nothing compromised with the commissioner's computers, and I even refragged their registries.
you know, most people think refragging is a big waste of time.
lieutenant.
What'd Dr. Morales have to say?
commissioner had no defensive marks.
no sexual assault.
and the cut on her neck definitely happened postmortem.
see, I -- that's the part I don't understand.
why do you cut the throat of someone you just murdered?
it's a symbolic gesture of some kind.
just don't know what it means yet.
Yes, lieutenant?
are you gonna eat that crust?
Yes, I am.
Oh.
okay.
uh, in the 20 years that he's been at Folsom, Tomas Medina has only had one visitor -- his grandmother.
and that was about 17 months ago.
here's his record and a complete transcript of the hearing before commissioner Ross.
what about phone calls?
zero. Incoming or outgoing.
um, could you please -- phone.
thank you.
deputy chief Johnson.
where are you?
is that chief Johnson?
my proctologist. You need something?
no, no. I just...
you're asking where your proctologist is?
Yes.
I hate it when he surprises me.
chief -- Chief, Medina is here.
What?! He wasn't supposed to arrive for another two hours at least.
well, air support had a cancelled pick-up, and so Medina was flown in directly.
and Pope is not happy that our suspect is here and you're not.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, tell him I'm on my way.
let's go.
C - can I have that?
Yes.
and now, my guy gives you pictures of the colonoscopy after it's over.
all right, here we go, everyone.
do you realize how long you've kept everyone waiting here?
before I start asking questions,
I need to know at least some of the answers or we'll never get anywhere.
chief, I have Sanchez bringing Medina up from holding.
uh, where do you want him?
hard interview 1.
no. I'd prefer to question Mr. Medina in one of my interview rooms. It's less intimidating.
he's been in Folsom for quite a while.
I think he expects some intimidation.
and you're missing the point here.
we're not doing this interrogation to prove - buzz.
that he committed the murder, but to show the likelihood that commissioner Ross' death was not the beginning of a string of attacks against the whole parole board.
well, you may not need a confession, but I certainly do.
the guy's in prison for life.
what more are you gonna do to him?
and why are these screens still not working?
that's not my fault.
bank fraud's projector is keyed to the same remote signal as ours.
all right, just -- just get it fixed, please?
thank you.
here.
we may need to communicate during the interview in case there are questions.
from whom?
from me!
put in the earpiece, and let's hear what Medina has to say.
buzz, are we all set? Speakers? Volume?
we'll know as soon as they start talking, chief.
Mr. Medina, I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
this is detective Gabriel. I hope you enjoyed that hamburger.
there's another one coming for you just as soon as we're done here.
we just have a few questions for you.
it shouldn't take too long.
I got nowhere to be.
you can ask me anything you want.
good.
what, if anything, can you tell us about commissioner Danielle Ross?
I can tell you she's dead.
and how did you hear about that?
good news travels fast.
does it?
when someone like Ross gets offed, yeah, it does.
even the guards are talking about it.
I take it you weren't one of commissioner Ross' fans.
that black bitch passed me up for parole three times.
maybe it's because she didn't like being called a black bitch.
Yeah, well, she's dead and I'm not.
so who has the final word on that, huh?
just because I'm in lock-up doesn't mean that I don't have people on the outside who care about me.
get in my way, somebody moves you.
he's all but admitting it.
tell chief Johnson to cut to the chase.
chief Johnson, let's, uh
let's get to the point here.
and these people on the outside who care about you - - Are any of them a girlfriend?
you looking for a conjugal, mija?
Hey! Watch your mouth, sir!
sir?
keep that up, I'll have you drive me back to the airport, boy.
I wouldn't call any of them my girlfriend, but, uh, I do all right.
and when, exactly, do you "do all right," Mr. Medina?
because according to the people at Folsom, you haven't had a visitor or even a phone call in over a year.
so, maybe the people you do all right with are the men in prison with you.
well, obviously I have a little army on the outside, boy.
Yeah, well, a man who hires a guy to kill his wife and then rats that guy out usually isn't too popular.
detective Gabriel's right about that.
you might not be as popular with the people at Folsom as you think you are.
you want to know how to make friends in prison?
you get rid of the black bitch who's keeping us all in there.
you see, whoever does that gets loads of respect.
all right, he's almost there. Let's ask him something concrete, like, uh, does he know commissioner Ross' address.
Mr. Medina, do you know where commissioner Ross lives?
Yeah, sure. She used to invite me over for Sunday roast every weekend.
is this your first time doing this?
do you really think I'm stupid enough to say that I killed her to you?
or to them?
no, Mr. Medina. I don't think you're stupid.
but I also don't think you had anything to do with the commissioner's murder.
what is she saying?
why are you saying that?
however, since good news does travel fast,
I have a feeling you may already know who is responsible for her death.
and if you were to help me figure that out,
I could end up getting your sentence reduced.
that's a -- that's a commonly used negotiating tactic.
no promises have been made.
I guarantee it.
that's not a promise.
you know what would happen if anybody found out I was talking to the cops?
I don't kiss and tell, Mr. Medina.
nobody... - Don't say nobody will find out because somebody always does!
and the deals you people make -- You know, I actually fell for it once.
Yeah, eligible for parole in 17 years.
I'm in two decades already, and I'm starting to figure out that it's all bullshit!
you know what?
you people ain't never letting me out of here.
instead, you're just filling up the streets with all those freaks.
what freaks?
the crackheads, the perverts, the thieves that you're letting out of prison because the state ran out of money to keep them there.
you know what?
if I had just beaten my wife instead of having some idiot shoot her in the head, I'd be a free man today.
you did everything but curtsy to the guy.
then you offer him a reduced sentence.
did you not just hear Medina say that he could have hired someone to kill commissioner Ross?
his little army
all the freaks the early-release program lets out onto the streets.
the early-release program is for nonviolent prisoners, not murders.
but the fact that they're nonviolent only supports the theory that the commissioner's murder was carried out by an amateur
Mr. Medina hired from inside prison.
why do you say "amateur"?
because an experienced killer would never have waited for commissioner Ross inside of her house.
or vandalize her car or break into her house a second time.
leave a box cutter behind, spray gardenia perfume everywhere.
and Medina used an amateur to kill his wife.
so, that's his m.o.
so, can you at least just go back in there and get him to tell us some of that?
I could probably get him to say almost anything right now if I offered him a milkshake and a side of fries.
Yeah, but what if we arrest Medina now and two days later, your worst fears come true and another commissioner is shot to death?
where will operation: swift justice be then?
Oh, I forgot.
it's your investigation. I'll do whatever you want.
heaven's sakes!
chief, where are you taking us?
chief Pope commandeered our offices, so we're gonna use his.
while he's looking at people who were in jail last night, we may find someone who was actually available to commit the crime.
why can't I ever find that ridiculous keycard?
Oh. Oh, wait. Here. Here, chief. Try this one.
Oh, thank you.
well, don't thank me. It's Flynn's card.
W - what are you doing with my card?
I lost mine, okay?
you went through my desk?
uh, uh, chief I'll, uh I'll take care of pope's secretary.
she's sweet on me.
um, chief Pope suggested that we use his conference room for a bit.
uh, we won't be long.
it's all right? Okay? Yeah?
well, I'm beginning to get discouraged.
should we include unidentified sharp objects?
tao might have something, chief.
it's not exactly right, but
richard Conway. Convicted of drug possession.
served 20 months before being let out on the early-release program.
two days after his release, Conway killed 32-year-old white male -- Scott Weber - At an atm downtown.
check out the crime-scene photo.
look familiar?
a little too familiar.
but Mr. Conway was arrested 12 hours later.
he confessed to the murder.
so he's got the same alibi as Mr. Medina.
he's in jail now!
there's this. Look.
commissioner Ross signed his conditions of parole.
this guy was in the lock-up when the commissioner was murdered.
y - you think he broke out of jail to kill the commissioner, then he broke back in jail and nobody noticed?
detective Verico said that he thought commissioner Ross' stalker might have been a woman.
so, what if this Conway guy -- What if he had a girlfriend? Or a wife?
would it really hurt to bring him in for questioning?
well, it's either that or we go back swift justice.
no. no. no.
anything but that. Yes, bring him in.
thank you.
Thanks, chief.
Hey, Gabriel, when you question this guy, remember to ask him how he got in and out of commissioner Ross' house with all the windows barred and all the doors locked.
think I figured that out already.
I never t-thought it would come to this.
you know, killing someone for a little rock.
addiction is a terrible thing, Mr. Conway.
did you have anyone to talk to about it?
a wife or -- Or girlfriend, maybe?
no.
but even if I had, it wouldn't matter.
when I need it, I - I need it.
and that night
I need it.
so when you saw Mr. Weber at the bank machine, you thought, here's where I can get the cash to buy my drugs.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I-I got out of -- out of this pickup that I stole, and I went through the bed, and there -- There was this toolbox.
that's where you found the box cutter.
Yeah.
the guy thought I was joking.
he told me to take off or he would call the cops.
but I-I need that money.
and when he wouldn't hand it over?
I - I cut his throat.
and I left him there at the ATM.
I- I took him f- from his wife and his f-family f- for 40-- $40.
but they should have never let me out of prison.
cause I-I said so in court.
I told them,"I'm only gonna get high, man.
but they didn't care.
they didn't care at all.
if -- if they hadn't paroled me, it would have never happened.
killing that guy was not my fault.
everyone else hated commissioner Ross because she kept them in prison.
this moron hates her because she let him out.
can you believe it?
I'm sorry, detective. I - I think we're done here.
thank you so much, sir.
wait.
uh
I- I h-hate to ask this.
but could you -- Could you tell her that I'm sorry?
tell who you're sorry?
the guy's wife.
could you tell her, um
I - I was out of control?
and
that I'm, uh, sorry?
yes?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the l.A.P.D. Major crimes.
thank you so much for coming in today.
I've got an apology to pass along to you.
I - is there more bad news?
I'm afraid so.
but I should probably let the detective in charge explain it all to you.
by the way, that is a lovely perfume you're wearing.
reminds me of home.
a flower, I think?
G - gardenia.
Yes, gardenia. I thought so.
ma'am, I'm detective David Gabriel.
I'm one of the original officers who investigated your husband's murder.
um, I just want to say that we're really sorry about all this.
sorry about what?
what's wrong?
well, as it turns out, mrs. Weber, the man who we arrested for murdering your husband
he is innocent.
no. That's -- That's not possible.
I'm afraid it is.
ma'am, you see, the blood that we found on Mr. Conway's clothes, it does not match up to that of your husband.
No!
Oh, my goodness!
hold on. Hold on.
okay.
okay, Mrs. Weber. Hold on.
detective Sanchez, would you get her a glass of water, please?
Mrs. Weber,
I-I know that this is just terrible news.
but -- but I promise you that the l.A.P.D.
is doing everything that we can, even as we speak, to find the real killer.
but he -- he confessed.
how could he confess to something he -- he didn't do?
he was so high when the police picked him up, he would have admitted to anything.
Mrs. Weber?
she's going into shock, chief.
I'm fine.
I just need to lie down.
well, the least we can do is drive you home.
Where's your car?
detective Sanchez, why don't you follow us?
want to show us where your car is, Mrs. Weber?
why don't we head on down to the garage right now?
Mrs. Weber, we're really sorry about how long it's taken us to figure out our mistake.
but Conway said he did it.
unfortunately, Mr. Conway was hospitalized for an overdose during the time of your husband's murder.
Oh, my goodness.
is that a roadblock?
we're having trouble getting you home, Mrs. Weber.
the president's in town.
there's lots of detours.
I'll try another route.
let's go this way here.
do you guys have any idea who the killer really is?
Oh, well, we believe so.
Yes, ma'am.
who?
who killed my Scott?
we're looking for someone much smarter than Mr. Conway.
we're dealing with obsession here, a real stalker.
Oh, my god.
you're scaring me.
Oh, don't be frightened, mrs. Weber.
we're very close to an arrest, I promise you.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
another roadblock?
I thought you were taking me home.
where are we?
you know very well where we are.
um, I-I've never been here before.
Oh, yes, you have, mrs. Weber.
your perfume hung around long after your first visit.
and you accomplished a pretty neat trick, too.
getting inside this house and leaving it all locked up behind you.
I kept trying to figure out how someone could have managed that when I should have been wondering why someone would break into commissioner Ross' car and not steal anything.
but you did steal something, didn't you?
I.d.Cards open everything these days.
signals move things up and down.
and I'm taking a chance here that this opens a garage.
you broke into commissioner Ross' vehicle and you used her garage-door opener to reprogram the one in your own car.
then you used that signal to break into her house and kill her!
Ann Weber, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you can't afford one, one will be appointed for you by the state.
have you heard and understood these rights, ma'am?
Oh, my god.
how many times?
how many times did you come back here before you found the door from the garage to the house unlocked, huh?
once? Three times? Eight times?
she never had that door locked.
ever.
I could just come and go as I wanted.
and then one day, I found her gun.
and I took it.
and the box cutter?
I only had the box cutter to show her how that maniac killed my husband!
the one that I thought she let out on the street.
the so-called nonviolent offender.
how could you have arrested him?!
how could you have made such an awful mistake?!
we didn't.
what?
we didn't make a mistake.
you do understand, mrs. Weber, that the early-release program was not commissioner Ross' idea.
all she did was sign the papers the state put in front of her.
letting Conway out -- She had nothing
nothing -- To do with that.
Yeah, well, she went along with that!
isn't it obvious?!
what's obvious is that you're a lunatic who's under arrest for murder.
and on the subject of early-release for nonviolent offenders?
I'm afraid that that's a policy that won't apply to you.
in fact, I-I don't think that your parole hearings are gonna go very well at all.
lieutenant Flynn
Ann Weber, you're under arrest for the murder of Danielle Ross.
this way, ma'am.
detective Verico,
I think, uh
it's unfortunate that my concern about this murder led me to
inadvertently hold you responsible for what happened to commissioner Ross.
that's the best you can do?
I don't know how to respond to that.
I'm not surprised.
mind if I go back to work, sir?
please do.
Thanks.
and, chief Johnson good luck.
thank you, detective. You too.
good night.
I hate to say this, Will, but this whole chief-selection process?
it has not brought out the best in you.
and if this is how you intend to run the department, I'm not even sure it's a job you should have.
well, you think you could do better?
I'd be really disappointed if I couldn't.
Brenda, you -- you -- You cannot imagine the -
the kind of pressure I've been under here for the last few months.
Half-dismantling metro division.
putting experienced detectives back out on patrol.
scrambling to keep our guys on the streets.
however it may look from where you're sitting, I I'm doing my best to protect the l.A.P.D.

potentially shot a security guard inside.
just use caution.
Freeze!

thank you for calling Fantasy Kitchens, your family's first choice for quality materials.
a fantasy kitchen spe...
I've been trying to reach them for two hours now.
it seems like they're screening their calls.
thank you, and have a fantastic day.
Hey, this is Steve Hayward of the L. A.P. D. again.
please pick up the phone, guys.
I want to make sure everyone gets through this in one piece.
thank you for calling fantasy kitchens... - It's been three hours.
how long can they hold up in there?
we could send in a robot with a cellphone.
a fantasy kitchen specialist will return your call as soon as possible.
thank you, and have a fantastic day. - Agent Howard.
all right, listen, guys. Don't hang up.
let's talk this thing out. - My apologies to the FBI, but this is no longer just a bank robbery.
they killed a security guard.
Yeah, we heard. How many suspects in the store?
two.
well, we'd like to speak with them, you know, alive?
I can help you if you let me.
maybe we could arrange that if they'd pick up the phone. Guys.
Yeah, we're ready to give up.
we're out of ammo, s-so no more shooting.
we're gonna send people out front.
okay, good.
how many folks you got in there?
we got three people in here.
is that everybody, then?
what do you mean, is that everybody? You saying I'm a liar?
no, no. Not at all.
cause we're seriously letting these people go.
we're gonna send them out.
all three of them.
go on. Go on. Go!
I count one, two...
three hostages.
thank God.
okay. Terrific. Thank you, guys.
now, just give us a second here to get these folks situated, and this will all be over real soon. I promise.
suspects went out the back door firing.
both of them down.
Oh, damn it!
what? I love happy endings.
we need to see the bodies. - Why?
well, this doesn't feel like a happy ending to me.
brown coveralls.
what do you know?
I need to see his face.
come on.
you're still missing three suspects.
how do you know that?
guy in the brown coveralls belongs to a professional group of bank robbers we call the "Dear Jane Gang.
that's catchy, but what does it mean?
well, Dear Jane gang always pass a robbery note to a female teller that starts with her name.
dear Jane," for example, "we're holding your husband and kids hostage.
if you want to see them alive again, you'll empty all the cash drawers.
now, they know the kids' names, the husband's name...
so they really do their homework.
there was no note this morning.
well, I want to see the security footage from the bank to be sure of that.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
where are you guys going with all this junk?
it belonged to one of our dead bank robbers...
not, uh, brown coveralls but the other guy?
Yeah.
this is all the evidence we collected on the warrant.
well, I guess the chief needs to see this, but the front of the murder room is filled with witnesses from the bank robbery.
well, then, where would you like us to put it, lieutenant?
well, I haven't heard any complaints out of the super-cubicle for a while.
wait. We can't just dump...
you gonna help me or what?
okay, according to witnesses, brown coveralls is saying, "everybody down, everybody down.
and over here, brown coveralls tells the security guard to put his weapon on the ground, which he does.
then the security guard's gonna make a move.
and there's the shooting.
and here it is again.
the guard's Andre Hicks, 65-year-old ex-marine, basically there to open the door for people.
and gave his life for $8 an hour.
okay, so I see two robbers here, but you say there are more?
well, Dear Jane usually has four inside and a getaway driver outside, for a total of five guys.
buzz, can you shift to the parking-lot footage?
sure.
okay.
uh, well, two run out - they're looking for their ride.
now, in their 20 or so jobs, they've always used a van as a getaway.
so, where is the van?
you seem to know an awful lot about these Dear Jane people.
why haven't we ever heard of them before?
well, I've heard of them.
what? The FBI sent out flyers.
we also e-mailed you footage of the Dear Jane robbing a bank in orange county last month.
buzz, would you please look up that e-mail for me? Yeah, chief.
yeah,'cause I never saw it. - You've been very busy, sir.
now, you might try removing "FBI" from your junk filter.
another question, Agent Howard...
how did you recognize the guy this morning if they always wore masks?
actually, up until this morning, they never wore masks.
they usually wear baseball caps.
so, this morning, two suspects... not five...
wearing masks - not baseball caps...
bust into a bank with automatic weapons, don't use a note, do kill someone.
despite all those discrepancies, you're convinced that the two guys that we ended up shooting today are part of this "Dear Jane" outfit?
found the e-mail, chief. Oh.
you want to play it, Buzz?
okay.
there is brown coveralls.
now, here are two other guys.
now, this one, I think, is the second suspect from this morning.
and then... okay... freeze. Can you freeze it?
all right. Punch in. There.
Yeah. That's brown coveralls.
and I am telling you, regardless of what happened this morning, these guys are criminal masterminds.
Masterminds?
meet Mr. Brown coveralls,
A. K.A. Dennis Bailey, and his partner, Jason McDonald.
what kind of masterminds bring their I. D. to a bank robbery and then try to escape on foot?
well, at some point, there was a van.
uh, excuse me, chief Johnson. We're back.
finished with the warrant, got some stuff.
afternoon, everybody.
well, thank you.
uh, lieutenant Tao, would you please go back through the footage and see if you can find any sign of a getaway van?
I don't know how I'm supposed to look for people I can't even see.
Hey, chief? Robber one, brown coveralls...
that's Dennis Bailey, and the address on his driver's license is old, so we currently have no idea where he lived.
but the guy that was with him, Jason McDonald...
his place was pretty special, chief.
Yeah. His whole place was filled with these.
wait a minute.
why are you putting all this junk in my cubicle?
cause nobody ever comes back here, sir.
what was he doing with all these safes?
dear Jane started out boosting safes, from restaurants and bars.
you know, their move up to banks has only been in the last two years.
two years?!
but if you've been working on this case for that long, why haven't we heard...
uh, wait a minute. Is this even your case?
well, n-not exactly.
well, then, why are you here?
um, I just found out my new assignment this morning.
and, uh, well, there is supposed to be an official announcement made tomorrow, but, uh, this bank job...
well, anyway, um...
I've been appointed the new FBI liaison to the L. A.P. D.
Well...Congratulations.
I guess you'll be working very closely with...
whoever is the next chief of police.
I don't... I don't understand.
I... You never said anything about being up for the liaison...
I didn't know, myself.
I walked into work today, and now here I am.
well, thank you for the warm welcome. - Oh, well, of course.
we're all looking forward to working with you.
Oh. I mean...
congratulations, honey. I'm... I'm...
I'm so happy for you.
and I-I think we should all start working together, r-right now.
these safes, for instance...
why don't we run all the serial numbers against whatever data the FBI has on the prior...
burglaries.
Um...So...
if you agree, uh, chief Pope?
love it.
all right, then.
uh, would you please join me back in the electronics room?
certainly. - Thank you.
Oh, and, gentlemen, if we are dealing with a mastermind here,
I seriously doubt it's the guy who has safes in his house.
so, let's keep looking for the address on Dennis Bailey, our Mr. Brown coveralls.
thank y'all so much.
so, the day before they're supposed to announce the short list for candidates for chief of police, the FBI sends over her husband as the new liaison officer.
are you gonna give him his own office?
so, we lined up the security codes of the robbery footage with the parking lot security cameras.
so you can see the shooting starts here.
and seconds later, a Ford sedan whips out of the parking lot.
but there's no clear view of the driver.
wait. There's something we may have missed, though.
as the Ford's backing out...
...the reflection of the bumper... there!
the license plate. Lieutenant Tao. Mm.
good catch, Buzz.
Thanks.
Oh. What "oh"?
comes up "Confidential - L. A.P. D.
the registered owner of this vehicle...
is a cop.
a cop?
that guy was with us this morning.
hostage negotiator.
he's in the murder room interviewing witnesses with Provenza right now.
detective Steve Hayward.
who better to set a fire than a fireman?
now do you believe there's a mastermind?
so, you know something I don't?
about?
maybe the FBI gets a heads-up who's on the short list for chief.
suddenly, they decide the husband of a certain high-ranking female officer would make a good liaison.
look, if you're saying I'm here because I'm close to Brenda, you could also say I'm here because I'm close to you.
Really?
where did I go to college?
back east.
Stanford.
what did I get my master's in?
Mm-hmm. Never mind.
how old are my kids?
Yeah. Right. They chose you because you and I are so tight.
let me ask you this.
does Brenda even want to be chief?
because I've worked my entire life for this job.
well, then, I wish you good luck.
would you like to join us in the conference room?
chief Johnson wants to... do a quick debriefing.
excuse me one sec.
right this way.
you guys unhappy about something?
detective Hayward, you've had so much success handling hostage situations, talking people out of doing terrible things.
I was curious...
what do you think went wrong today?
well, nothing went wrong, per se.
the suspects were unpredictable, based on the ar-15 and ak they were swinging around.
those are pretty nasty weapons to bring to a bank robbery.
it's almost like they wanted us to shoot them.
suicide by cop.
looking at the transcripts, you never once asked the suspects to drop their weapons. Why?
I was focused on the release of the hostages, who were, despite my apparent lack of success, set free.
a vehicle registered in your name was seen leaving the bank this morning during the robbery.
that's your car.
I-I-I came to work this morning in my crown vic.
this...
I bought this car a couple months ago...
for my wife.
Where's your wife at this moment, Detective?
what does she have to do with any of this?
well, isn't it obvious? - Not to me, it isn't.
look, let's just get back to where your wife might be.
she said something about a...
meeting at a church.
then why was your car at the bank...
this morning? How do you explain that?
I can't.
okay, Detective, this is what we need.
confirm exactly where you were during the robbery and your wife's cellphone number.
just... just do that for us, Steve, and...
and we can straighten this whole mess out.
Oh. Lieutenant, would you please get the Detective's statement right away, please?
so, sorry, chief.
I-I still don't know where brown coveralls...
I mean, Dennis Bailey... lived, but I found his brother, Jed Bailey, and he's here in L. A.
Mr. Bailey.
uh, are you Jed Bailey?
I sure am. How can I help you?
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson of the L. A.P. D. and this is special Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI.
may we have a moment of your time, sir?
sure. What is it?
when was the last time you saw or spoke to your brother - Dennis?
uh, is... is he okay?
Oh, my gosh. What's happened to Dennis?
I-I'm fine, honey.
um, take the kids inside.
I'll be in in a minute.
was your brother alone the last time you saw him?
Uh...Yes. He was.
he was...Almost always by himself.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
Mr. Bailey.
we're sorry to tell you your brother Dennis robbed a bank this morning and was later killed in a police standoff.
that...
that can't be Dennis. There's no way.
I'm sorry, sir, but we have him on film, and he had I. D. on him when he was killed.
Jed, everything okay?
uh, doing great. Thanks, Gene.
my brother's not a violent person.
he's never owned a gun in his life.
well he had one today.
and he used it to kill a security guard.
no. Oh, no, no, no.
well, he must... he must have been mixed up with somebody.
well, he was, sir.
this man was with him at the bank.
does he look at all familiar to you?
no. I don't know. It...
is he the guy with the guns?
they both had guns, sir.
sir, can you tell us where your brother lived?
Oh, my gosh.
what is it, Mr. Bradley?
those beers...
he promised me he was gonna quit.
I even drove him to a couple of AA meetings.
it's a difficult thing to stop drinking.
could you tell me where those AA meetings were?
chief, it looks like the one from the Orange County job.
guess he had a thing for these.
what are you talking about?
they're comfortable, and they don't show dirt.
40 grand in the medicine cabinet. - Okay.
he hides his money at home and holds on to his precious brown coveralls.
not a mastermind.
so far, the only person we've met capable of planning something like this is Detective Hayward.
Hey, chief.
you know that getaway car we thought belonged to Hayward?
here's a rental receipt for one exactly like it.
good afternoon, folks.
my name is Boyd. I bet you're looking for a minivan.
actually, we are trying to locate this car.
I'm sorry. Has your vehicle been in an accident, lost, or stolen?
no. We didn't rent the car.
we just need to know if it's been returned.
Oh. Uh, okay. Let me just...
see here.
lieutenant Tao.
okay, here it is.
uh, it was picked up this morning, at the driver's request.
who picked it up?
he's out back. I'll call him for you?
no, no. Don't call him.
I'll go get him.
uh, chief.
Sanchez says he has Hayward's wife in the murder room.
Uh-huh.
she says she was at choir practice this morning during the robbery.
and she has the car, but it's missing the front plate.
missing the front plate?
they stole the cop's license plate, put it on their rental car so that they wouldn't get pulled over.
Yeah, but how did they know that Mrs. Hayward's husband is a cop?
I told you. They were smart.
Hey! There's no Tim working here.
Boyd returned the car.
Boyd? Who's Boyd?
the guy helping us" Boyd!
Oh, you mean Boyd?
Where'd that little jerk go?
I think that's him.
there goes another one of your genius bank robbers, driving off in his little clown car.
well, he has the getaway part down.
Oh, thank God.
food.
I'm starving.
Hey. I got great news.
the FBI caught the Dear Jane getaway driver, Boyd Martin.
you say that like it's a bad thing.
you stole my suspect.
working together doesn't mean that we find him, and then you swoop in.
we didn't swoop.
we tracked his financial transactions and then deduced.
Oh, for Pete's sake, don't gussy it up.
Boyd Martin paid for an airline ticket using his own credit card.
a deaf, dumb, and blind orangutan could have tracked him down.
well, then, why didn't you? - We did.
and don't pretend you don't know this.
the L. A.P. D. was there.
undercovers watched Boyd go into that airport parking garage and never come out.
doesn't take a mastermind to figure out the feds grabbed him.
you can't blame us because we like our suspects alive.
Yeah, well, what if Boyd was meeting his conspirators inside the terminal?
then we could have caught the whole Dear Jane gang, together.
anybody at the FBI ever think of that?
will you relax?
besides admitting he's the getaway driver,
Boyd is not talking to the FBI.
well, he should be not talking to me!
this is exactly the same thing you always accuse me of.
you hate it when I take help and information from you and then arrest the very person we're both looking for.
at least I don't lie to you.
I have been completely honest with you. - I have never lied to you!
Oh! That's the biggest lie of all. - Not once.
not once. Never. - You know what? I don't take it personally.
maybe I have omitted certain details about...
if you want to lie in order to get Boyd transferred - into L. A.P. D. custody, you go right ahead. - I will do whatever necessary to get that kid in my interview room because he is guilty of a triple homicide.
triple homicide? You're including Bailey and McDonald?
they're bank robbers.
you don't get to decide who my victims are.
three people were killed in that bank robbery.
a - and California law - they don't care
I-i-if Boyd drove the car or pulled the trigger.
Boyd is not the mastermind of these robberies.
once and for all, we are not looking for a bank robber.
we are looking for a murderer!
and if the FBI thinks that they're gonna make a deal with Boyd on a bunch of no-account robberies, well, they are jumping the gun.
because I am arresting that kid even if I have to get a court order to do it.
now who's not working together?
and they jumped the gun on that, too.
appointing you liaison...
before the short list for chief even comes out.
I mean, what if I'm not on it?
so you think the only reason the FBI promoted me is because of you.
well, that's not the only reason.
um, of course you're qualified.
you know, this should have been a really big day for me.
Oh, honey, I-I'm proud of you.
I am.
whenever you don't get what you want, you go straight for the jugular, every time.
what is that?
I'm sorry, Fritzi.
I'm mostly doing so much better with these things, aren't I?
I'm not a suspect!
I completely apologize!
you did steal my suspect.
we're checking out all the Haywards' friends.
they're both on a bowling team.
no link to the robbers there.
wife's in the church choir.
they ask to go home?
no. We kept them comfortable overnight.
they're watching tv now.
Hey, chief. I'm, uh, looking at Hayward's finances.
he's got no boats, no second homes, no Vegas blowouts or anything like that.
meanwhile, everyone else from Dear Jane had big money problems.
Dennis Bailey, A.K. A. Brown coveralls, was drowning in credit-card debt.
and, uh, his partner from yesterday, Jason McDonald, he literally put the "dead" in "deadbeat dad.
and our rental-car specialist, Boyd Martin, has 80 grand in college loans.
chief, I found something on the safes.
a few of the serial numbers tracked back to burglaries in Oregon, where Jason McDonald went to college.
was Dennis Bailey ever a student there?
Dennis Bailey never went to college.
Mm. Big surprise.
what about the Haywards?
born and raised here. Met at UCLA.
and Steve's... Um, Hayward's alibi during the bank robbery checks out.
so why are you still holding him?
detective Hayward's union rep was here for like half an hour, complaining about how he's being treated.
tell him the detective's making overtime and that he's helping us solve the case.
Helping" by watching cable in your conference room with Provenza?
until I figure out how his license plate wound up on the rental car, - I certainly ca... - I know.
maybe Detective Hayward is the Dear Jane mastermind and he gave the plates to his partners because nobody pulls over a cop's car.
and if they did, he could just say,"someone stole my plates.
it's incredible. - Thank you.
I mean,"incredible..."
incredible... not credible as in "wrong" as in it's wrong to trash Hayward's reputation and piss off the union just so you can look all tough for the Mayor!
I'm tired of being treated this way.
you are exhausting everyone who works here!
I can't wait for this whole "chief" thing to be over!
says the person whose husband was just appointed FBI liaison to the L. A.P. D.
I suppose you think I had something to do with that?
well, you couldn't be more wrong... again!
come in!
excuse me, chief...
um,"chiefs.
we found a link between the Dear Jane gang and Detective Hayward.
good thing he's still here, then.
may I?
Yes. Sorry to have kept you.
so, tell me.
what type of parking lot could you reliably expect to be unattended for an hour or so at a time?
I don't know. A theater?
try the parking lot at Detective Hayward's church.
how does that connect to the robbers?
well, it doesn't, exactly, but remember Dennis Bailey's brother, Jed?
well, it turns out Jed and Detective Hayward attend the same church.
uh, chief? Someone tagged a photo of Jed Bailey on Facebook, some kind of college reunion.
now, Dennis Bailey may not have gone to school with Jason McDonald, but Jed Bailey did - They were part of the same frat.
that Jed Bailey is such a good little liar.
and stealing a cop's license plate from church?!
Finally!
signs of intelligent life from inside the Dear Jane gang!
so Jason and Dennis connect to Jed.
what about Boyd?
you think the FBI's gonna let us talk to him?
no.
but maybe they'll help us if I tell them we're gonna search Boyd's house.
wait. W-we need the FBI's cooperation for that.
well...I'm about to get it.
pardon me.
special Agent Howard. - Oh, hello, Fritz.
I am officially requesting that the FBI liaison officer provide the L. A.P. D. with all of the information y'all have on one Boyd Martin.
you know I can't do that.
all right, then.
we'll have to go search his house.
we have all the evidence.
you have no standing to search his house.
actually, I do. I have a witness.
who?
you. - Me?
did you or did you not tell me last night that Boyd admitted to being the getaway driver?
I did, but that was during a personal conversation with my wife.
so, do you want to be listed on my search warrant as a witness or an informant?
Brenda, we are getting our own warrant for Boyd's house.
Oh! Look...
either I put your name on that warrant, or you tell me what I want to know.
you know, I-I-I really think you are beginning to lose your perspective.
my perspective?!
the FBI is fiddling around with a bunch of bank robberies while I've got a triple homicide to solve!
what about that poor security guard, huh?
are you telling me that no one is going to jail for his murder?
you are my husband!
you're supposed to be helping me!
that is just the beginning of my perspective!
you want more? 'Cause I can give it to you.
hold on for one second.
chief, Flynn says that...
well, maybe now is not a good time.
I'm on hold with our new FBI liaison officer.
and I'm all out of candy bars. Oh. Oh.
well, you know what they say.
it's, uh...
never easy working with family.
anyway, Flynn says the license plate was stolen.
so can we let the Haywards go home?
please?
all right, I will answer your questions if you promise not to serve this search warrant.
is Boyd Martin related to Dennis Bailey, Mr. Brown coveralls?
Yeah. They were second cousins.
any other questions?
no.
well, yes.
do you know who the mastermind is yet?
no.
good,'cause I do.
if Boyd Martin is Dennis Bailey's second cousin, that means he's also Jed Bailey's second cousin.
that means they're all connected.
well, does that mean that we can say goodbye to Ozzie and Harriet in our conference room?
I cannot sit through one more episode of "House Hunters International.
no.
we're still missing the fifth Dear Jane gang member.
but, here.
give them some candy.
gentlemen, whenever people run away from us like that,
I feel the least we can do is chase after them.
I agree.
good afternoon...
I forgot your name.
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
gosh, I'm sorry, chief Johnson.
but I'm actually running late for a meeting at the funeral home about my brother's memorial service.
is there something I can help you with real quick?
golly gee, there is, real quick, if you could turn around, put your hands behind your back so I can arrest you for the murders of Andre Hicks, Jason McDonald, and Dennis Bailey.
what? Murders?
jed Bailey, you have the right to remain silent.
if you give up that right... Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
bad dog!
no ball! Go home!
go home, Ralphie!
go home!
y'all have been so patient.
I'm so sorry to have bothered you with all this.
Hey. Sometimes crummy things turn out okay.
but that's what overtime is for, right?
uh, speaking of which, would you, uh, would you sign that time sheet for me?
Oh. Uh, of course. My pleasure.
you know, we're putting all this extra cash toward that condo we saw down in Panama, and you are gonna come to visit, mister.
can't wait for you to get there.
there you go. Thank you so much.
so, where are we with Jed Bailey?
well, his, uh, income tax return said he made about $38, 000 last year.
his new S. U.V. is worth maybe twice that.
and on top of that, he's got his kids in a private school and a golf-club membership in the five figures.
someone from the Dear Jane gang is making money robbing banks.
chief, we got the statement from Gene-Gene, the jogging machine. Oh.
guy wouldn't shut up.
Yeah, Gene is $350, 000 upside down on his mortgage.
Ohh. This statement is full of good stuff.
but Gene also said he wasn't at the robbery yesterday, - and neither was Jed.- Uh-huh. So?
so, you can't make Jed Bailey for the murders at the bank if he wasn't there.
Oh, he was there, lieutenant. I promise you.
jed Bailey was at that bank.
if there's anything more that I can do to help the police, of course, I want to do it.
like I said, I-I had no idea who Dennis was running around with.
I don't know what I can tell you beyond that.
not even about your neighbor Gene?
is... is he mixed up in all this?
well, Gene says, in the last four years, he's participated in over 30 burglaries and 10 bank robberies planned by you, sir.
wait! What?
look, we already found the safes you stole, Mr. Bailey.
we collected them from your fraternity brother's house.
not to mention all the video footage we have of you in a baseball cap, handing threatening notes to tellers.
but I-I-I don't care about all that.
I care about the murders.
murders? Now, hang on.
three people were killed at that bank yesterday, Mr. Bailey, including a veteran, and you were there.
I'm sorry, but you people have it all wrong.
you can ask my wife where I was all day yesterday.
now, wait. Wasn't it your wife's job to babysit while you were out robbing?
because Gene says she did that a lot, which makes her as guilty as you.
now, hold on. My wife...
and... and you believed him?
just saying whatever?
lying about my kids even?
let's talk about your kids for a minute, Mr. Bailey.
I-I don't mean the private schools, the fancy away camps, and the beautiful house...
all the luxuries you've managed to give them on a $38, 000 income.
but how will they survive without their dad and their mom?
you claim you weren't at that bank yesterday, Mr. Bailey.
make me believe you.
my wife had nothing to do with any of this, okay?
I'm listening.
and I never killed anybody.
ever.
what I was doing
I was doing to help my friends and my family.
you mean Dennis, Jason, Boyd...
and Gene.
I cannot believe Gene turning on me like this.
people, man.
they see a chance to jump ahead of you, brother, they grab it.
I'm... I'm just - I'm so disappointed in the world right now.
how is it, Mr. Bailey, that after all the robberies you did, rescuing your friends and family, they still have their same old money problems?
Yeah. I can only do so much.
gene, for instance, my neighbor,
I gave him an extra 10% on the last job so he could keep his house.
no, no. He says you only did that because you didn't want a foreclosure next door.
Oh, well, that's a lie, and he knows it.
the other guys were plenty upset when I helped him.
isn't that because you took Gene's extra money from their cut, not from your 60% cut?
I had the most to lose!
a wife, kids, everything we work our whole lives for!
I did all the planning.
I researched bank employee schedules, floor plans...
I made sure that there were no schools or parks nearby.
no potential harm to kids.
I made it safe for people!
Really?
tell me how sending your friend and your brother into that bank with guns a-blazin' made things safer.
I didn't send anybody into that bank!
Oh, I guess you were too busy. - No!
so you sent a friend and your brother into that bank... - I didn't do that.
I would never do such a thing. - ...So that they could take all the risk.
you put them... - sir... I swear.
I have proof that you deliberately put your brother... - I planned that robbery.
would you just listen to me for one second?... - Into harm's way...
I passed on that bank!
I passed on it!
I said,"do not rob that bank"!
you passed on that bank?
Yes! That is what I am trying to tell you!
Why?
because when I inspected it,
I found too many entrances and exits.
I told the guys it was going on the "maybe later" pile.
she's right. He was there.
did you steal a policeman's license plate...
we got the confession. - ...From his wife's car at church?
for another job.
next week.
which I'm pretty sure is canceled.
you scouted that bank.
and you rejected it. - Yes. Yes.
that is exactly what I am trying to tell you.
and, even if I had said,"let's go ahead,
guns would not have been any part of my plan...
for that bank or any bank.
all right, Mr. Bailey. I believe you.
I believe that you were not at that bank yesterday during the robbery.
your gang got greedy and pulled off a job without you.
exactly. - But...
you still have the license plate that was used in the robbery.
and worse, you cased the bank as a target.
that makes you an accessory, which means you are as responsible for the murder of that security guard as your friend and your brother, neither of whom would have been there if it weren't for you.
and how do I know that?
because they're not smart enough.
hold on. Hold on!
wait a minute!
Yes, Mr. Bailey?
I'm not the kind of criminal you're making me out to be!
Oh, I know precisely who you are, Mr. Bailey.
you're the man that murdered his brother.
that was fast.
y'all must be anxious to close your bank robberies.
just like you are to finish your murder.
Boyd thinks he's here to talk about driving the getaway car.
you get Gene a deal on all state charges?
he wasn't at the robbery yesterday, and he didn't plan it, so he's all yours.
did you happen to mention the federal government would have their own charges to press?
Oh, may have slipped my mind.
Hello, Boyd.
you drove off so quickly yesterday,
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself.
I'm deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
how do you do?
well, I'm just fine and dandy.
but you're under arrest.
I can't be under arrest.
I-I made a deal with the FBI.
tell her about the deal we made.
your deal is for bank robbery.
you're not going to jail for that.
you're going to jail for murder.
but he... he said...
this isn't an argument, Boyd. This is an arrest.
what's going on? What's happening?
Toodles!
is there anything you want to say to me?
if I hadn't shown up at the crime scene in the first place, you never would have known there were three more suspects.
I'm happy.
I'm happy that you were there to help me with my investigation.
And?
and thank you.
but...
Ah, ah, ah.
you were doing so well.
come in.
here's the apology to Detective Hayward's union rep you asked for.
I noted your objection to holding him at the beginning of the letter and the end.
good.
glad that's over.
wait. Wait, wait.
I-I just...
I wish I could handle this whole selection process some other way.
you know.
some...
better way.
it's okay, Will. It's fine.
my hope is that, uh...
you know, when this whole thing is over, we can...
somehow, you know, find some way to - to keep our relationship.
we will.
we... We will.
wait, wait.
chief Pope.
good. Finally.
And?
Uh-huh. Him I expected.
who else?
okay.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
Yeah. Bye.
well, the short list is out...
and you're on it.
and...I'm not.
you're kidding.
Oh, Will. I'm... I'm so sorry.
and, uh, you'll be getting a call any minute now, and, uh, there are reporters downstairs...
I don't even want the job to begin with. Well...
I'm never gonna get appointed.
no, no, just... go ahead. Please. - Just... I should just drop out.
please get out!
please.
take that outside...
...and go.
please.
deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
thank you.
all right, gentlemen. What do we have here?
looks like a drive-by outside a neighborhood bar.
lots of 7. 62 casings, probably from an ak-47.
we have three male african-american victims.
two dead here, third guy died on his way to the hospital.
there are over 100 patrons of this nightclub holed up inside.
I thought it would be better to interview them downtown, so I've got buses coming in to pick them up.
thank you, lieutenant. Just, uh, make sure we don't let anything slip by.
thank you. All right, detective. What gang are we dealing with here?
in between territories, chief.
Maywoods to the north, rolling 50s to the south.
it's kind of a neutral area gang-wise, so it's hard to say who might be responsible.
do we have any idea what time this all went down?
uh, the victims left the club around 1: 00 a. m.
that's when a dark blue or black sedan drove down the street.
the, uh, the manager, who was outside having a cigarette at the time, said he heard the shooter yell,"what up, t-ball?" before he opened fire.
we're running "t-ball" through our database now.
did the manager know of any arguments from inside the club?
no, he said it was a mellow night.
we checked security cameras.
they don't have any. One of the reasons why this place is so popular.
splendid. - sorry you had to wait.
I'm the only guy on tonight.
I'll be out of your way in a sec.
all right, lieutenant. What do we have here?
chief, that victim tried crawling away.
this one... Never had a chance.
and, uh, that's what's left of the one who died on the way to the hospital.
what is it, detective?
I'm not sure, chief.
they don't look like gangsters.
this guy's wearing army dog tags.
what?
this one too.
these men are soldiers.
chief. Chief.
turns out the third victim is alive.
where? - County general.
they're trying to stabilize him now.
lieutenant tao, when you having interview with the people from the club, we need to keep the facts to ourselves.
just find out if anyone from inside knows about these murders.
Yes, ma'am. - And let's get these bodies removed before anyone else has a chance to see them.
detective gabriel, please call chief pope.
let him know I need to speak with him as soon as possible.
and, lieutenant flynn, contact the army.
don't give away any details, but tell them I need a military representative to meet with us tonight.
Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.
guy flatlined three times in the ambulance.
the emt had given up by the time we got here.
then out of nowhere, the guy coughs, and now they're working on him again.
he's in here.
thank you.
is he conscious?
barely.
I - I need to ask him some questions.
just don't get in our way.
what -- what's his name?
dog tags are on the tray.
Mr. Baylor?
Mr. Baylor, I'm a police officer.
I want to ask you some questions.
ty, look at me. Can you hear me?
he can't speak. His lungs have collapsed.
ty, I want to find out who did this to you.
I'm gonna ask you some questions, and -- ugh.
spin an "h" and "h." He's got a bilateral hemothorax.
we've got 400cc in the chest tube.
I want you to squeeze my hand. Okay?
squeeze once for "yes" and twice for "no.
can you do that?
good. Good.
did you see who shot at you?
he's bradying down.
d - do you know why you were shot?
did it have something to do with your military service?
he's lost his pulse again.
ty? - Go! Go! We have to open up now!
ty, did it have anything to do with your military service?
let's go! Coming through.
guy didn't make it, huh? - No. No, he didn't.
let chief pope know i'm here, please.
uh, he's not in, and he hasn't called me back.
well, could you try him again?
this case could end up having national security implications, and I-I may need his help.
thank you.
okay, folks. Here they are. Chief.
three members of the u. s. Army rangers.
sergeant Willy Ogedi.
he's from Tulsa, 22.
we have sergeant Lance Riggs. He's 23, from Detroit.
and, uh, here's the young man you went to the hospital to meet, staff sergeant Ty Baylor, 24, Los Angeles.
um, as a matter of fact, he apparently, uh, was raised in this area here, about four miles from where he was... Shot to death.
now, this is the kicker, everyone.
these three boys just came home yesterday from Afghanistan.
uh, chief.
we've downloaded 34 of the bar patrons' phones, so far.
got three pictures and a video of our victims inside the club.
now, people we spoke to said they behaved themselves, stayed out of trouble.
detective gabriel, you said earlier that the shooter called out a name,"t-ball"?
do we know who that person is yet?
Yeah. An officer I spoke to in newton said that he knew of a t-ball that ran with the 110 crips.
110 crips roll in baylor's neighborhood, chief.
maybe sergeant ty baylor's moniker was t-ball?
no. He's clean. No gang background, no record.
uh, lieutenant tao, did anyone from inside the club actually see the bodies?
no. Manager says whenever he hears gun shots, he keeps everyone inside until the police arrive.
chief? This is major Edward Dorcet.
he was contacted by our military affairs officer.
uh, major, this is deputy chief Johnson.
pleasure, ma'am.
um, is there someplace that we could talk privately?
thank you so much for coming in, major Dorcet.
I'm assuming that the fbi has been notified, as well.
we haven't determined if this is a federal crime.
but as soon as we do
chief Johnson... Three members of the United States military are dead.
I'm aware of that.
and so you may also be aware that we are potentially looking at a terrorist act here.
there are people who need to be notified.
look, major, I asked you here, in person, because I'm going to need your help.
right now, we need to treat these murders exactly like a gang drive-by.
it is very, very important that you don't give any information to your superiors
excuse me, but I have three important objectives here.
first, I have to notify the Department of Defense in case this shooting was a terrorist attack on our soldiers.
then I must make sure that the person responsible is apprehended, and the families of these men need to be notified.
chief Johnson. - What is it, commander?
there's a guy here claiming to have information on these murders.
well, where is he?
he doesn't want to come into the murder room.
too many eyes between here and the elevator.
would you contact our official FBI liaison and alert him to my situation with major Dorcet?
you got it, chief.
chief Johnson, this is Turell, sergeant Ty Baylor's twin brother.
you must be t-ball.
Turell Baylor, also known as t-ball.
spent two years in juvie for armed robbery.
as an adult, he served 90 days on a gun possession, was arrested twice for narcotics, but no charges were filed, chief.
this guy's been an active member of the 110 crips since he was 15 years old.
none of that changes anything.
and everything about these murders says "gangs.
major, it's pretty clear that whoever shot these men was aiming at the wrong brother.
and when you have proof of that, I'll be out of your hair.
but at this point, I have standing orders to report these murders to the D.O.D.
and confirm that this was not a terrorist attack.
beyond that, I must see that the responsible party, or parties, are apprehended.
also, the families of these men deserve to know what happened to them.
sir, the minute you report this, the killer will find out he shot the wrong man.
and when this goes public, I will lose theonly tactical advantage I have.
look, major, you want to run and tell your superiors the sky is falling, go ahead.
but it's not gonna look good for you when homeland security raises the threat level and it turns out your guys were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
maybe you're unfamiliar with what happened in little rock last year, or fort hood.
but these attacks on our soldiers are not uncommon.
our active-duty personnel need to -- No
they deserve to be alerted to the potential for more acts of violence.
major, my father was an air force officer for 25 years, and I was born on a military base.
and -- and -- and tonight I held Ty Baylor's hand as he died.
believe me, no one is more committed to finding out who did this than I am.
just give me 15 minutes, let me go in there and talk to sergeant Baylor's brother and see if I can't nail down exactly what happened tonight.
just 15 minutes, please.
tell me how you found out about your brother being shot, Turell.
my cellie was getting blown up, getting texts from fools thinking I was the one who got hit out there.
thing is, people gotta go on thinking that, or they're gonna try again.
or they're gonna go after my family, instead.
that's why I want protection.
protection? - Police protection.
can you do that?
cause they killed my brother on accident.
I was the dude who they was after.
uh... Are you in a gang, Turell?
what you think, homes?
what makes you believe you were the intended victim tonight, and not your brother?
no. Everyone likes Ty.
Yeah, he joined up with the army, bought his ticket out of here.
but you stayed behind.
chose the life. You know.
that's why it's me they after.
and it ain't like tonight has been the first time, neither.
someone's tried to kill you before?
a few days ago. Thursday.
tell me. Where did this happen?
I was on 59th. - 59th and what?
if you want my help, you're gonna have to be more specific.
I was coming up on Crocker, I guess.
it was like 4: 00 in the afternoon, and this dude rolls up in a black cutlass, just unloads on me.
the manager told us that the car in the club drive-by tonight wasdark blue or black.
I dropped behind some trash cans, heard the shots popping all around.
he took off. I boned out, hit the first alley I could find.
show us exactly where.
chief, it's legit.
there was a radio call for shots fired at 59th and crocker for 4: 15 p. m.On thursday.
all right. We're gonna send a few detectives there, see if we can confirm your story.
okay, you got this, Sanchez.
grab Tao on your way out.
bring back a bullet that matches the bullets fired at our soldiers, please.
while we wait on that, why don't you tell me why you think someone's trying to kill you?
there was a store. All right? It was nearby where I lived.
been there forever. Everyone knows it's off limits.
like, you don't steal so much as a candy bar from this place. You feel me?
a few weeks ago, it got robbed and a couple people got killed.
and you were a witness? - Can't say.
where did you say this t-ball lived again?
Newton.
tell her he's talking about the shootin' Newton murders.
she'll know what you mean.
chief... He's talking about the shootin' Newton murders.
I think I know the case you're talking about. - You do?
there was a double murder at a convenience store in your neighborhood.
the 74-year-old owner was shot to death, along with his 8-year-old grandson.
Yeah, that's the one. Yeah.
why don't you tell me what you know about these murders, Turell?
not until I know you're gonna protect us -- Me and my family.
look, you answer our questions first, okay? - No, my mom and my sister first!
okay, just... Please!
my brother's already dead 'cause of me.
okay.
we're gonna send someone out there to pick them up. 2623 holly. Is that correct?
Yeah. Yeah, that's my spot.
detective Gabriel, would you and lieutenant Pprovenza see to it that Mrs. Baylor and her daughter are taken to a secure location?
Yes, ma'am.
chief, Newton was looking at a suspect named Reggie Moses.
okay. Your family's gonna be safe.
major. Special agent Howard, l.a. p.d.'s FBI liaison.
thank god.
you have to help me with this woman.
why don't you tell me what you know about these convenience store murders, and maybe we can find the person who killed your brother?
should I be looking at reggie moses?
Yeah. Reggie Moses. Yeah. Yeah, he 110 crip.
like me.
and why do you think it was him?
were you involved somehow?
look.
I just got to make sure I ain't gonna get in trouble.
that's all.
that's not a guarantee I can make at this time.
why don't you sit tight?
agent Howard. Nice of you to join us.
although I'm afraid we may have called you here for no reason.
excuse me? Why is that?
uh, well, major, it seems pretty clear to me from that interview that we're dealing with a gang matter here.
and that does not fall under the purview of the FBI.
look, all I heard was a story from a frightened kid - why aren't you understanding this, major?
who might be trying to save his own skin.
and not only that, it seems pretty clear that this t-ball is holding something back.
I say that you give him some kind of immunity agreement so - that he tells you what he knows without fear of the consequences! - Oh, that is absolutely out of the question.
major, for all we know, t - ball and Reggie Moses robbed that store together.
then t-ball could be a corroborating witness who could put Reggie away, which would allow me to at least partially comply with my standing orders to report this to
I need more time to prove that the -- I just gave you more time.
and I just gaveyou a plausible explanation for what happened.
please, major, I- I need -- Just give me until noon to find Reggie Moses.
I can't wait that long. - Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Major. Major.
while we let the l. a.p. d. find this Reggie Moses, why don't you and I notify the families of these soldiers?
now, wait, chief Johnson, please.
we will notify the families of these soldiers that their sons died in what may have been a terrorist attack.
but we will stress that this information remain secret until the military and the fbi can confirm the nature of the ongoing threat.
you're asking me to lie.
wait, wait. You either think that this was a terrorist attack or you don't, major
which one is it? - No. Listen.
speaking for the FBI, I think we give the l. a.p. d. until noon to find Reggie.
after that, if chief Johnson is wrong about who killed these soldiers,
I am sure she will help you sound the alarm herself.
fine. We'll notify the families as the fbi suggests.
but if other soldiers die today under similar circumstances, it's on you.
okay. Uh, lieutenant Flynn.
I desperately need to speak with Reggie Moses. Let's see if we can bring him in.
a - and get a warrant for his house.
maybe we can find some weapons that ties him to last night's murders.
thank you.
I, uh, figure you'll want the files for the shootin' newton murders transferred to major crimes?
Yes, commander. Thank you. A - and get chief Pope down here, please?
a - as soon as possible.
I - I need his support for the l. a.p. d.'s position on this case.
chief, the fact that you made the short list for chief of police and Pope didn't
well, he's... He's a little bit off balance.
then straighten him out, please.
I'm not about to let the killer of three american soldiers go free just because his nose is out of joint.
owned his store for 33 years.
he'd give out candy to any kid who came in and showed him a good report card.
practically considered family in the neighborhood.
his grandson, Chris, turned 8 a month ago.
shooter used a 9mm.
no hits on the casings.
crime scene photos are in here... If you want to see them.
it didn't hit the press, but, uh, apparently, little chris here was, uh, chased into a storage room, where he was...
shot in the head.
what do they know about Reggie Moses?
well, they say that he's the number-three man in the 110 crips.
certainly has the rap sheet to prove it.
hello. Major. Notifications go okay?
well, the families have agreed to keep the information to themselves for the moment, if that's what you mean.
I'm arranging for the FBI to relieve Gabriel at the safe house, where we're protecting t - ball's family.
we'll maintain them there till further notice.
thank you so much, agent Howard.
uh, commander. Any word on chief Pope?
he'll be here shortly.
chief, we found the bullets on 59th street right where Turell said we would.
and ballistics confirm they came from the same ak-47 used to kill our soldiers last night.
but the weapon from the convenience store was a 9mm, so if what Turell said is true, then Reggie switched guns.
newton found Reggie's prints all over the store counter.
so it seems like he's the right guy.
what?
Reggie Moses is a powerful member of the 110 crips.
I see him doing a drive-by, but why would he rob a store that's being protected by his own gang?
and shoot an 8-year-old boy in the process?
well, if it doesn't feel right, it's because there's something Turell isn't telling you.
I've said it before. Give him immunity.
major -- And get his story.
that is not an option. - Major.
it's pretty clear that he had nothing to do with last night's drive-by.
uh, excuse me, major.
chief?
meet Reggie mMoses. You want him in there?
Yes, please.
okay, well... Reggie's house came up clean -- No guns, no ammunition.
but we have his cell, and that's another matter.
he got a text last night. Check this out.
yo, club Beatz Turells in the house.
who sent that text?
it's from a prepaid phone, so there's no way of knowing.
Reggie's crew is smart.
FYI, Newton division said that Reggie lawyered up at the drop of a hat.
Really?
we'll see about that.
pardon me, gentlemen.
you ever deal with her before?
uh, on and off.
piece of work.
my opinion, she needs to get laid.
I don't think that's the problem, really.
Reggie, I take it you're familiar with the Niles convenience store?
the police found your prints there. - so?
so, they found them while looking into the murder of the store's owner and his 8-year-old grandson.
maybe I been there before.
but that doesn't mean I killed nobody.
besides... I went through this already with them other cops in newton.
Yeah, but now we're pretty sure there's someone who can identify you for those murders.
fool, please.
I bet you all the cash in your pocket there ain't no such witness.
Really?
did something happen to that witness?
what do you know?
listen, lady.
I'm gonna tell you like I told them other cops who was coming at me.
I want a lawyer. - Damn it.
major, I'm assistant chief Will Pope.
uh, commander Taylor brought me up to speed.
how can I help you?
lieutenant Flynn, why don't you put Reggie here in my conference room while he waits for his attorney?
and, uh, turn on the news for him.
let's keep him abreast of current events.
thank you.
come in.
what's going on?
we need Turell to tell us what he knows.
and offering him an immunity agreement is the wrong play to make at this time.
I have just set up Reggie to confess.
how? He asked for his lawyer.
if you allow me to keep him watching the news, he'll revoke.
I - I just need four more hours.
you're actually asking formoretime? I don't believe this.
major.
Turell's involvement in this case is way too murky right now to offer him a pass.
if he tells me that he was Reggie's accomplice, then he is as responsible for the death of that little boy as if he pulled the trigger himself.
we cannot offer him immunity.
Yeah. Actually...
you're considering this?
I don't care if Turell, or t-ball, or whatever his name is was a witness to what happened in this convenience store or an accomplice.
all I care about is Reggie Moses - I'm well aware of your objectives.
arrested for the murders of my soldiers!
and if the immunity agreement can do that, that's it.
I will get reggie to confess.
just give me four -- Make it three more hours.
just three more hours. - You're out of time!
so make the immunity deal, or I make my call.
let me know what you're gonna do.
Brenda, look, whatever else happens here, the guy who shot and killed three soldiers cannot leave our custody again.
this is not what I asked you down here to do.
Yes. It is.
have the D. A. draw up an immunity agreement, get Turell to sign it and tell you what he knows.
if you want to have any chance of being the next chief of police, you cannot start a war with the army, here.
get this over with.
for your own sake.
Turell Baylor's "get out of jail free" card.
if it comes to that.
you got Turell to give up his right to counsel?
I thought it might expedite things.
look, without a witness of some kind, you don't have a case against Reggie Moses.
Yeah, well, what if Turell tells us that he and Reggie robbed that store together?
and they're both responsible?
then Turell walks free.
I agree. It sucks.
but let's do it anyway, okay?
I take it you read the immunity agreement, Turell.
you bet.
you understand it's good only as long as what you tell me is true?
Yeah.
and you can't use nothingi say against me.
right? - That's right.
so, you initial here, here, and you sign down at the bottom.
and we agree to provide you and your family protection, so long as you are deemed a cooperative witness when charges are filed against Reginald Moses.
sweet deal.
you stated earlier that Reggie Moses made two attempts on your life in order to silence you.
because I know he the dude who killed those two at the store.
here we go.
tell me how you know that, Turell.
I was just going there for a soda.
Reggie comes busting out the door, crazy-eyed.
I see he's got the 9 in his hand, I'm like, "what's up"?
thinking that he robbed the place.
he just took off.
then I go inside and see old dude behind the counter with a hole in his chest.
I freak.
I'm looking around, find the little kid in the back room...
Reggie, man.
well... He shot him in the head.
so I gave the cops Reggie's name.
but those fools just brought him in for a few questions.
then they put him back on the street, where he knows I'm the one who dropped the dime on his ass.
what do you think he's gonna do then, huh?
is that all, Turell?
what you mean, lady,"is that all"? That's what happened.
earlier this morning, you said you didn't want to get in trouble.
but according to that statement, you haven't done anything wrong.
so why do you -- Why do you need immunity?
you mentioned that boy in the store.
had you ever seen him there before?
no.
then how'd you know to go look for him, Turell?
that boy was found in the store, turell, in an area... You couldn't see from anywhere else in the store.
you just said you found the owner dead behind that counter.
but instead of "boning" out of there, you decided to, what, wander around?
there was blood, you know?
like a trail on the floor.
I just followed it until I found the kid.
Turell, look.
there was no blood trail.
that boy was chased into the storage room before he was shot!
look.
I don't know what to tell you, all right?
that's how it went.
listen to me, Turell. Listen.
I told you that immunity agreement goes away if you lie, and that is exactly what you've done!
there was no blood on that floor!
Reggie's defense lawyer will have that statement of yours thrown out of court, and reggie will walk.
and not only will he walk for the convenience store murders, but he will walk for killing your brother, as well.
now, I'm gonna give you one more chance, t - ball.
and if you don't tell me the truth this time And I mean right now
I'm gonna send you home, release your family, and let reggie back out on the street.
how do you think that will turn out?
I can say anything I want about what happened in that store?
as long as it's the truth, yes, you can.
and it can't be used against me in court?
okay.
fine, then.
I did it.
you did what?
Oh, my god.
Reggie didn't shoot nobody in that store.
I did. I killed those people.
Turell Baylor's a double murderer?
no one saw this coming.
I go to the store now and then.
take some beers, you know.
thinking the old man owed up for how good my boys be treating him.
dude never made no fuss.
except this one day, he steps tome.
telling me I'm taking advantage.
I kept saying, "just give me the damn beer."
but he won't back off.
he's yelling at me, getting in my face...
talking about how he gonna rat me to my boys.
well, I ain't standing for that.
Nah. Some broke-down fool is gonna make me look bad?
so I pulled out my 9, and I shot him.
happy, major? That clear everything up for you?
and the boy? - I didn't know he was there.
then I see him crying in the doorway.
he's looking at me.
like he's gonna remember who I am, you know?
when he started running...
I just... Went after him.
and after you shot the kid?
ran into Reggie on my way out.
I knew I was in trouble with him 'cause I shouldn't have been messing around there.
so you called the police and blamed it on him.
that's right.
to savemyass.
ain't like I had a choice.
we have two separate perpetrators.
Reggie's triple murder outside the club last night and Turell's double murder at the convenience store two weeks ago.
and due to recent events, that double murder case is nowdead.
but Turell said that Reggie saw him walk out of the store.
that makes Reggie your witness against Turell.
but Reggie would also want a deal to testify against Turell.
and no prosecutor, including me, would ever offer him anything less than the death penalty for shooting three soldiers.
so, unless we find new evidence or a new witness, turell walks.
at least you got your confirmation.
right, major?
so this is not the outcome you wanted, but now we know for sure why Reggie pulled the trigger last night.
you can make your arrest, and then we can proceed - No, we can't.
we have no physical evidence tying Reggie to last night's murders.
his motive is legally established.
we could - Motive isn't evidence, major.
you're saying this bastard walks, too?
that's what we're saying. - Unless he confesses.
and considering we can't even talk to him since he lawyered up...
I will get him to revoke, if I can just go back to the plan
I was carrying out before this immunity deal was forced on me.
you see a way to arrest Reggie for killing those servicemen?
Yes, major, I do, because reggie was never aiming at those servicemen.
write down everything that happened at the convenience store.
is Southern California's housing market finally on the rebound?
yo, don't I get a phone call or something?
keep me sitting here all this time. And where's my damn lawyer?
I promise you you'll get your phone call, reggie, and when your lawyer arrives, we'll be sure to let him know that we've arrested you for murder.
arrested me for what murder?
witness came forward willing to testify that he saw you running from niles convenience store.
man, I told you before.
even bet you the cash in your pocket.
there ain't no such witness.
I can understand why you would think that's the case, especially after the stunt you pulled.
what stunt?
those guys you shot at outside the club last night.
guess what, Reggie.
you missed.
I believe you know Turell Baylor here.
son of a bitch. - He certainly knows you.
there's the reaction we want.
considering you tried to kill him twice.
that's why he's agreed to make an official statement against you.
and the two guys who were with Turell when you took a shot at him
they're giving their statements upstairs.
turns out you're a hell of a bad shot, Reg.
you were watching the news.
did you see any stories about people getting gunned down in front of a nightclub last night?
37 shots, and you didn't hit any of them.
which is lucky, actually, or you'd be on your way to an indictment for five murders instead of just two.
either way, what t-ball is writing down in there is gonna put you away for the rest of your life.
but the thing is, Reggie, I think he's lying.
I think he's setting you up to take the fall for what he did.
but I can't prove it because you won't talk to me.
I didn't kill nobody!
revoke your right to counsel if you want to give me your side.
Yeah, okay.
I'll talk. I'll tell you what happened.
it was that fool right there that was running out of the store when I rolled up!
newton division's got your prints.
because I leaned over the counter to see the old man.
then I booked. - And what about the boy?
I didn't even know he was there till I saw it on the news.
I ain't got it in me to kill no little kid.
and besides, that store is protected.
things like that come back on you, on the streets...
...or in prison.
is that why you wanted to shut Turell up?
Yeah.
firing a gun inside city limits is illegal.
and you did damage to several cars.
but since you just gave me testimony against Turell here, I'm not gonna charge you for any of that, as long as you tell me where you dumped the gun you used last night.
as long as people know it wasn't me who did that store.
the gun's buried underneath my neighbor's porch.
the yellow one... Next door.
got him.
well, I'm sure you did what you thought was necessary.
it can't be easy -- You being in the same gang and all.
and I bet you've known t-ball a long time.
Yeah, since he was a little kid.
you know his brother, too. - Yeah, I know ty.
he joined up the army, I think.
fightin' in afghanistan.
I ain't seen him in a while.
actually, reggie, you have.
what do you mean?
ty got back just yesterday.
and you saw him, reggie. - Where?
in the parking lot of the club last night.
you mistook Ty for Turell.
you shot him to death along with two of his army buddies.
no, no, no, no. You said I didn't kill nobody.
I lied. Bitch, I'll...
what just happened?
I don't know. She must have killed the feed.
you shot and killed three U. S. Army rangers last night, trying to get back at Turell.
so you end up with the death penalty, and t-ball here, he gets to go home, right back out on the street
even after what he did to those people in that store.
all right, lieutenant flynn.
it's time to give reggie his phone call now.
in fact, make it two.
however many you need.
it's the l. a.p. d.'s unlimited calling plan, reggie.
make good use of it.
chief. What do you want to do with turell?
I want to abide by the immunity agreement we made with him, detective.
don't you?
hey - hey.
listen. About Turell.
we'll stay on him. You know, one way or another...
don't worry about turell.
you have a plan to deal with him?
I do. - Good.
it may seem to you like my decision to give this creep immunity was somehow related to this whole "chief" business...
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not at all.
Brenda, let me just get this... Out of the way.
I would hate for what's gone on between us the past few weeks, you know, my behavior...
to completely cancel out everything we've been through together.
let me just say... I'm sorry.
and, uh, I'll see you tomorrow. - Yes, you will.
I want to thank you for coming forward, turell.
because of you, the man who murdered your brother will be facing the death penalty.
that's good. Yeah. It's the least I could do, right?
well, not really.
there's still the business about the old man and the little boy you murdered.
you said we were done with that.
you still have immunity, and that's a fact.
but if you would consider revoking that agreement, I might be able to help you.
Nah, I ain't never giving up my immunity, lady.
you gave it to me, I'm keeping it.
I figured as much.
so you know, Turell, your family's gonna remain under FBI protection until tomorrow when I bring them home.
you mean they're not at my house?
who's gonna stay here with me, then?
no one, I guess.
welcome home TY
what's up, t-ball?
see you, turell.
wait. Where you going?
home. - Why?
what's up with my protection? You're supposed to be protecting me.
according to the agreement you signed, we are only obligated to protect you as long as you remain a credible witness against reggie in the convenience store murders.
and that's no longer the case, is it?
come on. You can't just leave me here.
Yes, I can.
please.
don't worry, turell.
I have a feeling I'll be looking into your eyes again very... Very soon.
chief, you sure we shouldn't stick around?
I'm positive. Let's go.
how'd his boys even know he was home? The story hasn't even hit the news yet.
Reggie Moses was entitled to a phone call.
Maybehespread the word.
David, I want to leave.
please.

there's a bottle of lubricant on the floor over here.
peach flavored.

what happened to her lip?
she bit it.
the skull fracture didn't kill her.
she was smothered to death with this pillow.

captain Raydor's waiting.- One second, one second, Commander. Yes, Lieutenant?
Yeah, so in case you haven't seen her name on every poster in the place, the victim's name was Judy Lynn.
she was an actress/data-entry clerk.
building manager says she lived alone, so there was no need for a warrant.
her nails look perfect, so it wasn't much of a fight, was it?
probably not.
looks like Judy was either shoved or -- Julio?
or thrown into the wall.
smashes her head on the corner of this picture frame, Chief.
she falls, lies on the floor, bleeding.
then gets carried back to the bed to have a pillow put over her face, which is like some kind of weirdo thing to do.
but she had her nails done, had makeup on.
maybe she'd just been on a date.
well, that's how you meet weirdos.
chief...
uh, Buzz, uh, if you have all this, would you please document the body, especially the lips?
Yes, Chief.- Thank you.
Where's the gentleman who called this in?
he's in the living room.
uh, back here, please.
chief, you're supposed to be preparing for your final interview with the Mayor.
Yeah, I'll need to reschedule that.
no, y-y-you can't do that.
look, Chief... I can handle this investigation.
you only caught this murder 'cause Hollywood's got no overtime left.
technically... This isn't even a major crime.
why don't you tell the victim's parents that?
excuse me.
uh, Stuart, this is Chief Johnson.
chief, Stuart directed the victim in a one-woman show.
he also discovered the body.
this is like some kind of cosmic mistake.
I mean, how could this happen?
we're trying to figure that out.
now, I'm just gonna ask you a few questions and then we're gonna get you a ride home, okay?
Judy was your...Colleague?
colleague?
Yes, she was my colleague.
but she was -- we were very, very good friends.
Oh, my God.
and you dropped by this morning because...
Judy never misses a tech rehearsal.
so when she didn't show up last night and didn't answer her phone and never called me back, I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.
so I drove over, and I-I made Gifford open the door for me.
gifford is the building manager.
so was the door locked when you got here?
Yeah. Dead bolt and bottom.
did you notice anyone visiting Judy the night before last, or did she go out with anyone?
I don't know, really. The tenants mostly buzz up their own guests.
in a refreshing change of pace, they have working surveillance cameras at every entrance and exit.
videos are here.
okay, Stuart, I just have a few more questions.
um, since you were so close to Judy, c-can you tell me if she was going out with anyone?
the whole world could tell you that.
that's what her last vlog posting was about.
her what?
well, you're police people, so you probably haven't heard about her play,"Last Woman Standing"?
not before today. No.
okay, well... It was actually an extension of this really popular vlog she started, this online video diary she kept on her struggle to get work as an actor and how all the girls that she started out with have basically given up their own aspirations for men, which left Judy the Last Woman Standing.
the play was a big success.
except -- I don't know -- guys, they just completely stopped asking her out, so she joined an Internet dating site.
and I -- I sort of encouraged her to do it.
Oh, God.
c-can you tell me the name of this dating site?
and, yes, I chose it because i'm a musical-theater whore.
Plus, it's free.
so, I made up a user-name, since guys won't ask me out anymore.
however... Apparently,"Last Woman Standing" made it seem like I hated men.
and I don't. In fact...
I already have a date with one.
but not to worry.
I still won't have to change myself to become what others expect, because thanks to LAGuysandDolls. com,
I can create a completely fake identity while still keeping the one I have.
Hey, you guys want to see my profile?
okay.
Judy posted this video blog entry to her server Tuesday evening, 7:05 P. M.
Oh, he's here.
and, no, I am not gonna give you his real name.
well, of course not.
why make our job any easier?
but online, he goes by "Dreamweaver."
and he's cute.
Plus, he told me my picture made me look like trouble.
Yeah, I'll pass it along.
chief, Morales -- hold on one second.
so -- Yes?
morales can't confirm rape, but he's got a good DNA sample to go with all the fingerprints we got off the bottle of lubricant.
thank you.
how do I look?
first date in over two years.
okay -- Dreamweaver.
Dreamweaver.- And, dad...Don't wait up.
No! We need to meet him.
Yes, Lieutenant?
I have Dreamweaver's profile from the website.
no photo and no passwords to either his or Judy's account.
I like dinner and a movie. How about you?
I work with my head, train with my body, live with my heart.
looking to get my smile back. No drugs, please.
she'd still want a picture before going out with him, Chief.
Yeah, Judy said he was cute, so he must've sent her one.
there's no photo in her e-mail.
nothing about a date.
that's not how it's done, Tao.
what?
I've tried it.
the only way to exchange info is through your account on the website.
nothing else on her computer about dating, just letters home, letters to agents.
she communicated with her cable provider.
lots of problems trying to figure out when either she or her building manager could let them in.
lots of appointments.
Yeah, well, damn cable companies.
they say they're gonna be there between 8: 00 and 6: 00. They show up at 7: 00.
you know, she lived in an older building.
maybe she had a hard time finding that sweet spot where television, computers, phone, routers, all
uh, excuse me, Lieutenant.
um, Judy and this Dreamweaver may have exchanged phone numbers, so, uh, let's dump her phones and see who she was talking to.
okay. And let's serve this dating site with a warrant, please.
I want to meet Mr. Dreamweaver myself, and I want his account information in full.
already on hold with the judge.
chief? We're ready.
so, we have footage from all the security cameras from the victim's building.
okay, now, the camera over the front door pans the whole area at about a, what, 135-degree arc, Gifford?
uh, well, the camera goes back and forth all the time, yeah.
between 6: 00 and 7: 00 P. M.Gifford here says that all the people we see going in and out of the building are tenants.
until 7: 02, when this Camaro pulls up and the guy with the sports coat here gets out.
never get a look at his face.
that's 'cause he's texting the whole time.
do you know this man, Gifford?
I don't think so.
well, how do you know he's not a tenant from the building?
that's a 1970 Z28 Camaro.
no one in our building has a ride like that.
okay, now, Judy, on the other hand, drives a silver Nissan Altima.
which we have on the security camera over the exit to the garage.
now, that's the victim behind the wheel.
check out the passenger's coat.
Dreamweaver.
they leave... Time passes...
dinner and a movie.
why didn't they take his car?
he had a great parking spot, and -- I don't know
maybe Judy wanted him to come up to her place afterwards.
right. Love at first sight.
Judy's car comes back at 11: 03 P. M. Too dark to see anyone.
more time passes... When, you know...
he has sex with the girl and then kills her.
at least I hope that's the order.
and then here he comes again at the front door.
now, we still don't see his face, but look here. He stops.
cause when the camera pans back, he's still there.
why did he stand there for so long?
no idea, Chief.
I've been looking for you.
can we talk for a second?
what is the deal here?
the Mayor's expecting to interview you tomorrow to be Chief, and now you want to cancel that appointment?
look, I-I picked up a murder this morning, and I just don't think that now
come on. You've almost caught the guy already.
Taylor can take it from here. No problem.
come on.
what is going on?
I've thought about it, well, and honestly, I... I just -- I don't want to be Chief of Police.
thank you.
captain.
chief, thanks for making the time.
well, I hope we're not wasting it.
I think it might be Captain Raydor who's been wasting her time, since she's spent hours waiting for you and days figuring out how to prepare you for what may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be the next Chief.
so, when you say you're not interested in the job, it's -- it's very disappointing.
didn't you tell me yourself that I had no real chance at being Chief?
that you were only permitting me to submit an ap-- excuse me?
no, that's ... that's ...that's not what I said.-Permission?
I did not say that.-Yes, you did.
you permitted me to apply as a sort of stalking horse
you did not.-I did not give her permission.
okay, I think we can all agree that there were some serious flaws in my approach to campaign to be Chief.
for one thing, I'm no longer in the running.
but it is now in my best interest in all of our best interest -- that the Mayor appoint you as our next boss.
and if you just quit now... People will think you're hiding something.
or worse, you'll seem like a flake or like you broke under pressure.
whatever you do, you can't just cancel this interview, and you can't reschedule.
because when the Mayor calls for a meeting with his Chief of Police, he expects him or her -- to show up.
well, when people are smothered to death in their homes, they expect me to show up, too.
okay, I don't know what it was like in Atlanta, honey, but when you apply for Chief of police in Los Angeles and you don't get the job, there are big consequences.
Yeah, first, I get fired.
you don't know that.
and then, every success he's had, like, uh, Major Crimes, for instance, well, that gets completely dismantled.
chief... If you don't at least attend this final interview, the women of the L. A.P. D. will be completely demoralized, and many of them will never forgive you.
ever.
well, can I just skip the whole prep part?
I'll just go in there and be myself.
that is a terrible idea.
come in.
excuse me. Uh, Chief, we don't have an address, a work history, or a social yet, but the warrant on the dating site got us a name and a picture.
meet Marc Torres, A.K. A. Dreamweaver.
have a good idea where to find him.
where? -Where?
he's got another date.
this afternoon.
well, we can't arrest him unless we match his DNA to what was found in the victim.
so let's keep him under tight surveillance over the next two days and try and get
for heaven's sake, Commander, y-you know how to handle this, don't you?
Yes. Thank you.
uh... Let's go, Detective.
come on.
okay. Uh, sure.- Thank you.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guy, Torres is here.
I got the plate on his Camaro. You ready?
did you get that?
I lost my Web connection.
I lost Sanchez.
here. You can hook up to the Internet with my overdrive.
password's there.
cool.
okay, Taylor, the dirtbag is going into the coffee shop now.
can we get to his vehicle?
Julio says Torres will have his back to us.
did you read what he wrote to the new girl he's meeting?
great picture.
I've read your profile, but, to be completely honest, you look like trouble.
that's the exact same thing he said to Judy.
well, it worked.
this guy made over 11 dates on this site using the same line.
we're checking on all those girls to make sure they're okay.
listen up.
I just got Marc Torres' address from dmv.
if we're going to get a search warrant for his home, now looks like a perfect time.
what makes tomorrow better than any other day?
because the Mayor's just finished interviewing the other four applicants for Chief of Police.
and you're the only woman, so you'll make for a vivid contrast.
I think that we should capitalize on your feminine strengths.
which are?
uh, don't take this the wrong way, Chief.
because I have always admired with how little you care about current fashion.
and the -- the purse.
that... That purse. Come on.
that -- the -- the purse.
this purse helps people underestimate you, which I think, you know, is a good thing when it comes to criminals.
but the Mayor -- he's somebody you really want to impress, so I was wondering if we could
you know, Captain, I have a lot of nice clothes.
I just don't like to overdress at work.
Absolutely. And you know what?
there's no one that would ever accuse you of that.
but we want the Mayor's first impression of you to be as a woman capable of handling a lot of power, to look at you and think something like...
Wow. You look great.
you too. You too.
it's always a relief when people resemble their pictures a little.
well, you look even better than yours.
you know, I had a speech ready, just in case your first inclination was to run.
which was?
I know that I'm maybe not what you had in mind... You mean because I'm a woman.
no. No, no.
because most candidates for Chief of Police run popularity contests, and you're not especially political, well-liked, or even friendly.
I'm not interested in politics at all.
exactly. And therefore, you won't blame the Mayor for the L. A.P. D.'S budgetary crisis or publicly demand that he fix it.
Chief...Okay.
there is a reason that this is a short meeting in the afternoon, because all the Mayor really wants to know is how the two of you will get along.
I hope you don't mind this little -- I don't know -- speed date.
Oh, no. I get it. Totally.
think of it as a... Chemistry test.
and there was this one thing I wanted to know about.
what thing?
honestly, you look like trouble"?
what did you mean by that?
look... I got dumped about a year ago.
and I wasn't sure that I was, you know, ready to put myself back out there.
but then I saw your profile and your picture.
I don't know. My heart moved a little.
no way this rap works.
Yeah. If it does, I'll be using it word for word.
maybe it's just me, but... That sounded a little rehearsed.
you tell him, Jenny.
you're a little cynical.
no.
I'm a lot cautious.
so, I stuck the tracking device underneath the front fender.
so now, let's see what we have in the way of... Fingerprints, Mr. Torres.
I have to get back to work.
Yeah.
so... Movies next week or...?
maybe.
all right. -Bye.
all right, Buzz. Let's go.
little update, Chief?
right. Pardon me.
we got our DNA sample from Torres, and it's off to the lab.
we also matched fingerprints off his car to those in the victim's apartment.
now, Tao thinks he might've paused outside Judy's building because someone keyed his car while he was inside.
we don't know.
look, we have a problem.
what's that?
marc Torres is on another date.-What?!
the young Lady was waiting for him on a corner in Larchmont Village.
we don't know who she is or where she came from.
what we do know is that he took her to dinner and a movie.
just like Judy. And now?
now he's just parked beneath an apartment building on Melrose.
but, uh... It's not his home address.
chief, you already -- one second. One second.
commander, under no circumstances is Marc Torres to be left alone with another woman in her apartment.
got it.-Thank you.
spot 42.-42!
whose spot is that?!-Uh, apartment 207.
all right, take us there! Come on, take us!
let's go!
come on!
what the hell?!
what are you doing?!
l. A.P. D.Mr. Torres!
now, you stop moving!
what did I do? What did I do?
what are you doing?!
we're saving your life!
from my fianc?!
fianc?
why are you treating Marc like this?
to be completely honest with you, ma'am, he looks like trouble.
so unless you are arrested this Dreamweaver idiot for cheating on his fiance
not a criminal offense, by the way
we got nothing on him.
I gave the order to arrest Marc Torres, not them.
I was with you.
you did not give that order.
Yeah, you were not in charge.
it was either Taylor or Provenza who made the call to break in without a warrant.
so, why did you think it was worth it to bust in on this couple without enough evidence to hold this guy?
you mean besides the fact that he killed his date from the night before last?
did you want us to let him murder someone while under L. A.P. D. surveillance?
because then we could have held him without any problems.
but we won't have any problems anyway if you let me just talk to the guy for 10 minutes.
I really don't want her involved.
uh, excuse me.
uh, do you really need me to ask this guy these questions?
Yes. Thank you.
we can arrest Marc Torres in 10 minutes if everyone will just calm down and let me do my job.
okay? May I?
I thought y'all wanted me to be your boss.
gentlemen.
captain.
Mr. Torres, I'm deputy Chief Brenda leigh Johnson of the L. A.P. D. and this is Special Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI.
we want to thank you so much for cooperating with us.
why the hell am I here?
we're just about to get to the bottom of that.
detective Sanchez, would you please uncuff Marc, here, so that he's comfortable?
thank you so much.
all right, then, first things first.
the FBI has a few questions that they need you to answer because of a computer server issue.
we've got your fiance, Debbie, waiting for you in the next room.
agent Howard, if you'd like to start.
Mr. Torres... Do you know this woman, Judy Lynn?
uh, you said Debbie's here?
she is, waiting for you.
and she's very confused.
chief Johnson, do you mind?
Oh, no. Not at all.
so sorry. Go ahead.
do you know this woman, Judy Lynn?
no. - No.
did you go on a date with her the night before last?
Nope. - No.
were you ever in her apartment?
no. - No.
did you ever have sex with her?
of course not. I'm engaged. God.
that's great, just great. Brilliant.
that's all for me.
I believe Chief johnson has some questions for you now.
do you know this woman, Judy Lynn?
I just told you no.
here is all the communication, including pictures and e-mails exchanged between you and Judy Lynn, using an Internet dating website called LAGuysandDolls. com.
that's Judy?
well, yeah, I-I might've written to her maybe, but she looks different than her other photos.
did you ever go to her apartment?
no. Never.
these are pictures taken from the security cameras above the front door of Judy Lynn's building.
you'll notice you in your sport coat exiting your vehicle and again, here, entering the building.
I-I know somebody who lives in that same place.
so... That's a coincidence.
Really?
here is a fingerprint that was taken off of your vehicle.
and this one...
was taken from inside Judy's apartment off a bottle of peach-flavored lubricant.
they match perfectly.
is that a coincidence, too, Mr. Torres?
did you have sex with Judy Lynn?
because Detective Sanchez here took a straw that you were using from your date this afternoon, and if the DNA that we collected off that straw matches what we found in Judy Lynn
all right!
what do you want from me?
I went on a date with her.
we had sex.
and then I got out of there as fast as I could.
because you know what? She kind of freaked me out.
freaked you out how?
when we got to her place, she practically attacked me.
a-and then -- then she got all hysterical when I told her I had to leave.
and she keyed my car when I was in the shower.
bitch.
Judy attacked you?
did y'all get into a fight?
because I don't know what she looked like when you left her, but here's how she looked when I met her.
the night y'all went to the movies, Judy Lynn was brutally murdered.
and now, Mr. Torres, you lied about knowing her, you lied about going on a date with her, you lied about being in her apartment, and you lied about having sex with her!
when you say it all out loud like that, it sounds pretty bad.
Yeah, I lied.
my fiance's in the next room.
I didn't even know what this was about, all right?
but I have a lot of cops in my family, and you don't have enough evidence to hold me.
and lying to the police isn't against the law.
that's true.
but it is a crime to lie to the FBI.
that means you're under arrest, Mr. Torres.
yeah?
you want to play it that way?
I want a lawyer.
well, let's hope his DNA matches what we found in the victim.
will you make sure she gets across the street tomorrow?
I'll walk her myself.
I'll open a file on him if you want.
but when he's arraigned, you're gonna want to swap those "lying to a federal agent" charges with murder.
well, that's something to look forward to.
don't be late.
you got a big day tomorrow.
so everyone keeps telling me.
if he were a drunk, of course, it would be more obvious, but addiction is addiction.
and he just fell off the wagon.
ms. Shriner, your fianc has had 11 dates that we know of over the past two weeks.
look, your boyfriend didn't just "fall off the wagon.
he jumped with both feet.
and then he pushed the wagon over the cliff.
it's not Marc. It's the disease.
and these horribly enabling women that advertise themselves online these -- these whores.
I hate them!
sorry for interrupting.
pardon me, Ms. Shriner.
I was going through Judy's computer, and I found the last entry to her vlog.
But...She died before posting it.
thank you.
you got the left to the right and the right to the left.
Yes, that -- left.
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
no, the right. - Terrible, terrible.
Yeah, you got it.
okay.
I can't talk...Long, but...
this is raw, all right.
he said that...
I gave him that rush you feel when you meet the first person you like who really likes you back.
and... I fell for it.
and then the second -- and I mean the very second he was through, he got off me and he said he had to go and could he take a shower first.
God, I'm an idiot.
last woman dating is officially over.
but not before the part where I tell him off...
...which is coming up next.
so, that's how it went for that so-called whore last time your fianc had a relapse.
that's how she felt.
you see Marc's jacket, there on the bed behind her?
I'm sorry for this woman.
and I know how it must seem to you, like...
marc and she got into some kind of fight, but...
it's not how it looks.
slow down there, miss.
I'll walk you out.
you think she's telling the truth?
I don't know, but she's right about one thing.
it's not how it looks.
anybody back there? - Yeah, I am.
could you get me unplugged? - Sure.
Hello, Lieutenant Tao?
I was fine. Thank you.
I was looking at the
Yes, it is very exciting. The interview.
but I was -- Lieutenant!
I have a problem.
marc Torres said that the victim keyed his car, but she couldn't have.
while he was in the shower, Judy made a very emotional entry to her online diary.
here's what I need you to do. Okay?
now, Judy's vlog again, Buzz.
chief...
you look great.
well, thank you, Captain.
I've made a reservation for us down the
I don't have time for breakfast, actually.
Why? What are you doing?
trying to find out the exact time Marc Torres' car was keyed.
okay, you're going backwards... Backwards...
wait.
hold it.
there it is.
see? No scratch.
and then...
scratch.
we don't see who did it.
no, Chief.
what does that mean?
it means I've been spending a lot of the morning looking for things I can't see.
that scratch happened at 9: 45 P. M.when Judy was on her date.
would you bring Marc Torres up from holding, please?
I may need him.
and, um, your bag of tricks, too.
thank you.
chief, surely this can it. - I won't miss my appointment, Captain!
I promise.
I promise, I promise, I promise.
Gifford, I want to thank you so much for letting us in.
we shouldn't be but a minute.
you're making a big mistake.
Hey, you don't talk unless you're revoking your right to an attorney.
Gifford, since you helped the cable company get everything installed, do you think you could help us put it back the way we found it?
sure. -Thanks.
you ready to talk yet, Mr. Torres? No?
mind the blood.
so, I think the computer was set right here.
do you remember where the lubricant came from, Mr. Torres?
don't answer that, sir. Your lawyer would be very upset.
don't worry. I'm not talking.
well, you know what?
you don't have to talk, but you do have to watch.
Gifford, do you mind pulling these through, plugging it in on the other side?
sure. -Thanks.
what the hell are you doing, Lady?
just admiring how well you set up that closet for Judy.
she had trouble getting her modem and her router and her phone to work from the other room.
I wonder why, because we checked, and no one else in the building had any trouble at all.
anyway, somehow, you helped the cable company get it all hooked up for her in here.
cause you watched out for her, didn't you, Gifford?
a-and that's why you drilled this hole in the wall?
for all the cables to go through?
that's a big hole, Gifford.
y-you can sit on that stool and look into Judy's room without being seen and watch over her for hours.
I never did that.
Really?
you know, I wonder if the DNA evidence on the bottom of that closet will back you up on that?
sure you cleaned up after yourself, Gifford?
you know what else can't be seen on her vlog entries?
the pillow used to smother Judy to death.
that's because it came from this closet.
that's why we never saw it in her bedroom on any of her vlogs.
just like we couldn't see who keyed her date's car because you knew how to avoid the security camera out front.
I never scratched that car.
you want to see the gold paint on this key you so kindly left in the front door for us?
now, that we can see.
now, listen to me, Gifford.
I have a feeling that what happened in that hallway was just a terrible accident.
but if I'm right about that, I-I need to hear it from you.
look... I liked her.
I liked her a lot.
and I only wanted to look at
w-watch over her, like you said.
and that's what you were doing the other night when she came home from her date.
you were just watching over her.
mainly.
Yeah.
and normally, she takes a shower before going to bed.
and that's when I go.
but she was upset after that asshole left.
she just laid down on the bed for a long time.
I thought she was asleep.
when I tried to get out...
she heard me.
I got back in the closet, but it was too late.
she opened the door, and
a-and you held up this pillow, because she was hitting you, right?
I mean, you were just probably trying to get out this door.
but she wouldn't let me go.
right!
I didn't even know I could push anyone that hard.
it happened so fast.
you were just trying to protect yourself.
a-and you tried to help her, didn't you, after she fell?
show me.
well... She was knocked out for a second, so I... I put the pillow under her head to stop the bleeding, and then I... I carried her to the bed.
but then she started the screaming all over again.
so you were just trying to muffle the noise so she didn't wake the whole building.
I couldn't think of anything else to do.
she was so loud.
I think... I think you've done a very good job explaining all this, Gifford.
so, Gifford...
I'll tell you what we need to finish our report.
I'm going to tell you your rights.
and then you're going to write down exactly, everything you said about this accident.
and then we'll be done. Okay?
okay.
okay.
so what the hell did you bring me for?
well, you know, there wouldn't have been any paint left on Gifford's keys, so we had to scratch your car again.
what? - Sorry about that.
Oh, and, uh, I needed a witness to the confession.
gosh, I wonder if your testimony at the trial is gonna affect your wedding plans.
I'll tell you what.
you spring for the paint job, and I'll get the FBI to drop the charges, okay?
I was tempted to bring a uniform escort to take you across the street.
Oh, that's not necessary.
may I ask you a question?
sure, Captain. Why not?
do you really not want to be Chief of Police?
no, I don't.
and as a woman, don't you feel an obligation to at least give it a try?
as a woman, I feel I've earned the right to options, and one of my options should be to say no.
you don't think that I wanted to spend my career in Internal Affairs, doing a job that leaves me disliked and mistrusted by my fellow officers every day of my life?
no, I chose I. A. because I thought it was the quickest way to achieve rank.
and I also thought it'd be good for the department to see a woman in a Captain's uniform.
and, of course, you got your job the old-fashioned way.
how's that?
by sleeping with the boss.
that's not an insult.
it is a time-honored way of moving forward.
but those roads are not open to everyone, and you have the chance to maybe change that a little.
so, you're saying I should take the job whether I want it or not.
Yes.
please make the oh-so-terrible sacrifice of accepting a promotion that offers you more money, prestige, and power than any other job in the city.
and if it will help you with the suffering, you'll not only be a positive role model for little girls all over this country, but I personally will feel very...
I will feel very proud to have a Chief that I can truly admire.
well, thank you, Captain.
it's my pleasure, Chief.
see ya.
that is the last time
I let you talk me into a burrito grande.
I keep forgetting you got such a delicate stomach.
well, you're the one who has to live with the consequences.
EW. Gross.
great.
and we have found the male in distress on Stadium Way. We're in Elysian Park.
copy that.
sir?
how you doin' tonight, sir?
sir? - I don't know where I am.
okay. What's your name? - Where am I?
can you tell me how old you are?
chief, this is the run sheet the Paramedics used to record everything before they pulled over.
it says here they performed a G. S. - a Georgia Street lift.
a what?
please?
Gabriel, could you get her legs?
her legs? -Turn around and just lean back on me.
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Okay. Thank you.
chief, there's something I need to tell you.
chief, before you - I
who removed the bodies?!
that's what I was trying to tell you.
the Fire Department took them before we arrived.
l. A.F. D. won't let their people lie out dead
same as us out of respect.
that respect may have just cost us the investigation.
okay. The bodies are at Good Samaritan.
where do you want them?
taken immediately to our morgue, and I'll let you know - exactly how I want them brought in. - All right.
detective.
just as you asked.
you knew her?
we're friends.
good friends.
Oh, I'm so sorry, doctor.
who did this? - I don't , I don't know.
Y- you don't need to do the autopsy now.
I'm only interested in fingerprints.
uh, should I... should I take their gloves off? - No, no, no, no, no, no.
I- I want the gloves left exactly as they are.
please. Thank you.
lieutenant.
all right.
thank you.
see? The killer's fingerprints were on her glove.
this is why we don't move bodies.
the killer's name as Kevin Mason, and those are the fingerprints he submitted when he applied to the L. A.F. D.
I sure hope he was rejected.
Yeah, he was, four times - the last time in 2007, which is when he seems to have fallen off the map.
okay. Thank you, Detective.
please run down all of Mr. Mason's known addresses.
let's see if we can find him.
chief, the 911 cellphone
it turns out it's a prepaid job, used for the first time tonight.
not only that, it's got an FBI flag on it because it was purchased along with another phone that was used in an unsolved bombing attempt here in L. A. two years back.
a few years ago, a bomb was left outside an I. R.S. Office on Olympic.
l. A.P. D. Counterterrorism investigated.
Tommy Delk turned it over to the FBI.
chief.
911. What's your emergency?
I'm in Elysian Park, and this guy's having a- a epileptic fit or something.
you should send somebody right away.
he's, uh - he's up on Stadium Way.
it sounds like he's having trouble catching his breath, just like the guy the Paramedics picked up.
our 911 caller could be our killer.
uh, so, how are these murders connected to an attempted bombing of an I. R.S. building?
look, Brenda, if these were typical homicides,
I would be happy to have you pursue them on your own.
Oh, you're not suggesting I hand this case over to someone else?
the murders are now connected to an ongoing joint investigation between the FBI and our own Counterterrorism Bureau led by Tommy Delk.
please note the use of the words "terrorism" and "Tommy Delk.
what kind of a middle-aged man calls himself Tommy?
Oh!
he's on the short list for Chief.
that's why you want me to deal with him.
No! T-t-this is good police work.
and the FBI has already flagged that number, which means they're gonna be showing up here.
my advice is to put out the welcome mat.
I- I'd rather wait until I have something to trade.
you have fingerprints and a name.
listen, I'll arrange a sit-down with Delk.
and he's got a little bit of an ego on him, but he's not unreasonable.
only if he understands that until I talk to him, he is not to speak with the FBI.
believe me, if these cases are connected, he's gonna be a huge help.
if I find this 911 caller, I won't need anyone's help.
I've been trying to triangulate the cellphone, Chief, but it's not pinging.
once the 911 caller gets back online, it will show up right here.
I- I get how someone pretends to be disoriented or mimics a seizure.
but everything else recorded here
accelerated heartbeat, depressed respiration, dilated pupils - how do you fake those?
you can't. - According to the Paramedics' run sheet, these are the symptoms he presented.
while I'm waiting for the phone to come back up,
I'll look into it.
it was an exciting day yesterday for a group of children with cancer.
how is it ? - you're half my age and spend twice as much time as me in the bathroom?
I guess I'm just a slower reader than you.
Yeah. - Ready?
Yeah.
okay.
all right.
ready? One, two, three.
here's my question
where is Kevin Mason hiding...
for three years...
without being noticed?
let's go.
and we're off.
I don't know, Lieutenant.
but we better find him before he disappears again.
Ohh. Good morning, Commander. - Good morning.
just thought you should know, because the Paramedics' Memorial is now scheduled for Monday, the announcement for Chief will be delayed until Tuesday.
also, uh
I got it. Oh, thank you.
uh, Chief Pope has, uh, Delk in his office waiting for you.
and, uh
very good. Thank you. -Yes. Uh, yes. Uh
what is it, Commander?
well
look, Delk will probably have his own ideas for investigating the deaths of Silva and Vargas.
and you might want to keep that in mind when collaborating with him.
you want me to play nicely with Tommy Delk in case he becomes Chief of Police.
all I'm saying is that in addition to your two victims, there are several still-living people counting on you.
well, thank you for the vote of confidence, Commander.
good morning... - Morning.
...Chief Johnson.
come in.
chief Johnson, I believe you've met.
Tommy Delk. Good to see you again. - And you.
let's get started, shall we?
okay.
two years ago today, September 24th, a stolen pickup was left outside a Federal Office on West Olympic.
its flatbed contained a small explosive and a barrel filled with fertilizer and diesel fuel.
the explosive ignited but failed to set off the larger bomb, and a phone wired to the barrel as a backup detonator also failed because the battery had lost its charge.
well, that's lucky. -Yeah, for everyone.
if that bomb had exploded, it would have taken down half the I. R.S. building.
unfortunately, as far as evidence went, everything was untraceable, including the truck.
we did recover footage of the suspect buying two prepaid phones, one of which was the backup detonator.
but the video's poor quality made it impossible for us or the FBI to identify him.
I would very much like to view that footage.
the FBI has already made it available to you, along with the rest of its findings.
I- I'm sorry - you've already contacted the FBI?
I- I specifically requested that you not discuss anything with them until we had spoken.
chief Pope mentioned that.
you understand I'm in constant communication with the Feds and couldn't consider doing anything that would make me less than trustworthy.
as you may know, I'm somewhat connected to the FBI myself.
Yeah, uh, if I could just
I don't know what you've shared with the FBI, but I need to examine the materials connected to that previous bombing case immediately.
sure, and I'll tell you what you'll find - Jack.
we had the case for three months, and we found Jack.
the FBI had it for 21 months, and they found Jack.
well, you and the FBI may not have found Jack, but I did, and his name isn't Jack!
Really? Y- y-you've found him?
which means that I've had this case for less than eight hours, and I'm already farther along than you and the FBI after two years.
to be fair, you did have the benefit of new fingerprints.
I'd be curious - how much farther you'll get in the next three hours. - Three hours?
because that's how long the FBI has agreed to share their material before they take over your case.
that's what's been arranged.
I did not agree to that.
well, it's a good thing I'm not taking orders from you.
Yeah, believe it or not, I'm actually in charge here.
at least for the next few days.
and since this case seems to be more serious than we first imagined, Chief Johnson,
I'm sure you would like the FBI to have the benefit of your analysis.
and I would like the two of you to work together amicably.
you'll inform the FBI about Kevin Mason, and we will proceed as arranged, with Chief Delk present while major crimes examines the files.
and then three hours from now, it's the FBI's ballgame.
is that clear to everyone? - Sir.
Yes.
thank you.
why'd I buy some fancy damn electric wheelchair if it's always out for repair?
told you I'd have your chair fixed in three days. - Yeah.
until then, you should be enjoying the world's most overqualified chauffeur.
Yeah. - Here, hold this.
all right.
ready? One, two, three. - Yeah. Here we go.
all right, easy, now.
give me the remote.
Yeah, I got it.
given the recent budget cuts, it's expected that the programs will be phased out over the next three months unless emergency funding is approved in Sacramento.
well, the entire Southern California community is in mourning, as two Paramedics lay dead.
Anna Vargas, 35, and Anthony Silva, 39, father of three...
you wanted to work for the Fire Department.
...Elysian Park area at approximately 1: 00 A. M...
that could've been you.
...Believed to be a man in his 40's allegedly pulled a firearm and shot both Paramedics several times, killing them instantly.
you said when the small explosive ignited in front of the I. R.S. building, the responding Firemen came from a nearby station?
firehouse Number 59.
it's right - right there.
that's not nearby.
it's practically across the street.
which is why the fire was extinguished so quickly.
okay, and this happened at 6: 33 A. M.
okay, so, the FBI thinks some guy is smart enough to build a bomb from untraceable parts, but then sloppy enough to leave it right across the street from a firehouse?
maybe he didn't notice that.
I'm thinking he notices everything.
all L. A.F. D. stations change shifts at 6: 30 A. M.
30 firefighters, 2 full crews, could have responded to that first explosive.
whoa. Well, wait a minute.
are you suggesting that...
whoever left the truck wasn't aiming at the I. R.S?
no, he wasn't. A- and I don't believe that the small explosion was a detonator for a larger bomb.
it was bait to attract first responders.
so you think the failed cellphone was the primary, not the backup.
this person was looking to kill as many firemen as possible.
so, assuming that Kevin Mason engineered the first September 24th attack, why would he resurface to kill only two firemen when he previously aimed to kill dozens?
maybe shooting Silva and Vargas was the inciting incident, the small explosion leading to a larger one.
Brenda, Chief Delk.
good to see you both.
and you, Agent Howard.
as previously agreed, our people are here to, uh, take this investigation off your hands.
well, as it so happens, Chief Delk and I have been re-evaluating the case, and we both think that
that we should keep our arrangement with the FBI and our end of the bargain.
your files.
there were bullet casings.
NIBIN's got them.
but it's taking six hours for every year they go back in their database.
as soon as they record a hit, - I'll forward the findings. - Thank you.
Yes.
gosh, I'm sorry, Chief.
I thought we were on the same page.
for two years the FBI has been investigating a federal attack on an I. R.S. Office.
now, even if you're right, and Mason was aiming at the firemen, they'd be too embarrassed to admit they were on the wrong track for so long.
so we just give the case back to them?
we couldn't have said anything to change what just happened.
but now the FBI can do what they do best find the missing fugitive
while we use the resources of our combined divisions to investigate your crazy idea that the murdered Paramedics were just the first casualties of a larger assault.
so...
you don't want to tell the FBI that Mason was aiming for the fire department?
it's an untested hypothesis. It would just confuse them.
I don't think we'd want to send the FBI on a wild-goose chase, no?
Oh, no, we wouldn't want to do that.
I think we should consider that this Mason guy is going underground for a while.
tao or someone has been staring at that grid since Friday just waiting for our 911 caller to show up online.
if someone had been given this assignment after the first incident, they'd have been sitting there now for two years.
chief, the shrink who performed Mason's last evaluation is in interview 2.
mind if I join you?
of course.
it's right this way.
do me a favor, will you, huh?
explain why it's been three days and I still don't have my damn wheelchair!
you have a wheelchair, Russ. It works just fine.
I want my electric wheelchair!
and if you're not gonna give it back,
I'll do something about it.
Mrs. Whitley will get to the bottom of this.
if not, I'll call the police.
you're just crazy enough to do it, aren't you?
did you just call me crazy?
what are you doing?
just relax. O - only what I have to. What?
just relax. - What?
relax.
what - what
Dr. Wechsler, I understand you performed a psychiatric evaluation for a Mr. Kevin Mason when he applied to the L. A.F. D. In 2005 and 2007.
does this picture jog your memory any?
I remember my sessions with him, yes.
as you realize...
public safety trumps confidentiality.
what do you need to know?
anything that could help us understand his psyche.
t- there's a standard set of questions that we ask all applicants.
and the inappropriateness of Mr. Mason's responses was immediately apparent.
can you be more specific?
when I ask someone, "what's your idea of the perfect day?
most people say going to the beach with their girlfriend, that sort of thing.
and Mr. Mason's perfect day?
it involved discovering a threat to a local suspension bridge and his showing up to save thousands of lives.
no doubt the state-controlled media are proclaiming that the thousands of dead police officers and firemen are innocent victims!
my diagnosis was narcissistic personality disorder.
but they are not blameless. But they are not blameless.
the pathology is determined by numerous criteria
uh, does this person have excessive feelings of entitlement?
they embodied the perversion of the natural order!
are they preoccupied with fantasies of power?
they were defenders of a corrupt system!
I was merely a-an object in a system he felt was stacked against him because he's white.
Mr. Mason was convinced that's why he was repeatedly rejected by the fire department.
and how would you handle someone with this pathology?
carefully.
this is a man who doesn't think he makes mistakes.
they embody the concept contradiction can trigger a violent reaction.
he imagines himself top of the food chain...
I am the first wave. ... Without peer...
I am the first wave.
delusions of grandeur.
I am the first wave.
I am the first wave, first wave...
of the new flood that washes it all away.
...Meaning whatever you're thinking Mason might do...
...Think bigger.
chief, I just did an Internet search, and September 24th was the day in 1965 when President Johnson signed his Executive Order directing government contractors to enforce affirmative action.
september 24th. Affirmative Action Day.
so Mr. Mason is a man with a gripe.
chief, we got a hit on the casings.
14 years ago, a Russell Owens of Sherman Oaks took a shot at an intruder with his. 45.
and where is Mr. Owens today?
well, he was 71 years old then, Chief.
we don't even know if he's still alive.
neighbors said he was kind of a crank, moved away maybe 10 years ago.
if Owens collects Social Security, we can find out where he's getting his checks.
good idea. - All right.
uh, excuse me. Uh, who are you calling?
we have to let the FBI know about the casings.
Oh, I happen to know the FBI is asleep right now.
and there's no point in calling until we verify this.
remember, y-you said you didn't want to send them on a wild-goose chase.
Mr. Owens! Mr. Owens!
open it up.
Mr. Owens, it's time for breakfast!
are you up?
Mr. Owens?
dead. And cold.
how convenient. - Okay, the woman that manages the place says there's an attendant that spends most of his time with Mr. Owens, and he was here last night - Bob Gill.
look familiar?
lieutenant Flynn.
chief, we're at the assisted living center.
and we found Russell Owens.
he's dead.
you'll never guess who the attendant taking care of him was.
Kevin Mason. Have you found him yet? Did you make an arrest?
no, no, not yet. But we have a recent I. D. photo of him.
Yeah. Hold on.
chief, yeah, I've got an M1911 Colt. 45, semiautomatic.
I'm pretty sure it was used to shoot the Paramedics.
and tell her I found an anticholinergic
oxybutynin.
uh, uh, Tao says he's got some
well, he's got some, um
he's got, uh, cholera.
uh, or, what'd you say?
anticholinergic.
Ah, Detective! Oop.
chief, I found about 20 bottles of oxybutynin.
it's a bladder-control medication.
and that's important because?
well, in higher doses, the side effects of oxybutynin are increased heart rate, depressed respiration, dilated pupils.
all the symptoms Mason had when our victims picked him up.
why would Mason need 20 bottles of oxy-whatever to fool the Paramedics?
I don't know, but it seems like he stole a bottle from every patient in the place.
and you know what? There seems to be a couple of missing oxygen tanks.
wait a minute. Is Kevin Mason there or not?
chief, Kevin Mason, A. K.A. Bob Gill, clocked out of work about two hours before we got here.
Y- y-yeah, Chief.
uh, Chief, but Mason has access to a van that's currently missing.
okay, uh, scan and release his I. D. run the plates on the vehicle he stole.
and let's get everyone we can looking for that van.
Kevin Mason's up to something.
I'm sorry, Chief, but the nurses are asking if we have any idea of when we'll be done with this guy's body.
I guess they're already thinking about his funeral.
his funeral.
the Memorial for the Paramedics. When is it?
it's about four hours from now.
Why?
that's the bigger event.
he killed the Paramedics in order to bomb the funeral.
chief, we've got flyers of the van and Mason in every patrol car.
and the status of the roadblocks?
well, they're already up on Jefferson, Figueroa, and West Adams.
uh, they're going up now on Hoover and Flower.
and what about the bomb sweeps?
the techs just finished inside the Cathedral. So far, nothing.
good. That ought to ease your mind a little.
actually, Commander, the fact that we can't find
Mr. Mason or his van or the bomb makes me want to cancel this Memorial altogether.
eh, you're overreacting.
when Mason shot those two Paramedics, he wiped the ambulance clean, despite knowing that police backup was seconds away.
chief, we all know how methodical Mason is.
no, how methodical he was.
this morning he left out everything, including the gun he used to kill Vargas and Silva, where he knew we wouldi find it.
he no longer cares about what evidence we have against him.
he's on a suicide mission, and he is out to bomb that church.
all right, and how would he accomplish that?
even if he has turned his van turned into some kind of a car bomb, there's a perimeter of primary barriers covering more than an eight-square-block radius.
and no doubt Mason has already found some way around that. I'm positive.
and then he will be stopped by our roadblocks.
and if he's not stopped there, we'll get his van in a grid search.
we can defend ourselves.
there's no metal detectors in that church.
we don't need metal detectors. Besides, we can't use them
not with thousands of armed officers in attendance.
more like thousands of potential victims.
not only are there 3, 000 fire-department employees on that line, but we've got hundreds of police officers, the Mayor, and the Governor.
chief Johnson, the Memorial begins in 40 minutes.
if you really want to call this off, it's now or never.
can I have a moment?
two years ago, Kevin Mason failed because of a dead cellphone, but this time I'm convinced he's better prepared, and it's going to be a catastrophe.
if you cancel this funeral and no bomb is found, you will embarrass the department, and you will never be Chief.
I'll risk it.
no, you won't.
everyone, I'm canceling this Memorial until further notice!
my decision!
chief, I'm sorry to interrupt, but, uh, Flynn's with the grid search, and he's found something that you need to know about.
uh, Lieutenant Flynn?
chief, you can nix the idea that Mason was using the van as a bomb.
I'm looking at it now. It's empty.
nothing in it at all?
there's an envelope on the front seat with the words "to the media" on it, and a DVD inside.
what? Lieutenant Flynn, I can't hear you.
you're breaking up. We're on our way
thank you.
detective Sanchez, Detective Gabriel, with me, please.
this way.
morning. This way, please.
this way.
this way, please.
this way.
excuse me, sir.
w- what's going on?
the Memorial's been cancelled.
are you okay?
can I give you a hand?
Oh, man.
p5, please.
God bless you for your service.
thank you very much. You're very welcome.
here you go, Chief.
"beyond wrath & tears."Oh, my god.
they're sending a laptop over so we can watch it.
it should be here in a minute.
Yes, and detain anyone traveling in a wheelchair.
uhh, hang on.
chief Johnson.
chief, I think I know why Mason kept the stockpile of oxybutynin.
quickly, Lieutenant. I'm five floors underground.
I could lose you any second.
oxybutynin works like atropine.
it's an antidote to nerve poison.
and I think Mason used the bladder meds to protect himself while making nerve gas.
...Oxygen tanks...
I'm guessing he filled them with something like Sarin.
lieutenant, you're breaking up.
the tanks are filled with what?
I think the tanks are filled with Sarin!
nerve gas.
the Nazis invented it!
do I need to say anything more?!
a tiny amount in an enclosed space
chief?!
we got to go.
lieutenant, I can't hear you! Lieutenant
get up!
Whoa! Stay back! He's got a bomb, Chief. He's wearing a bomb.
do you know what a dead-man switch is?
I let go of this, we all die!
you know who I am?
of course I do.
you're the fugitive w- who's outsmarted the L. A.P. D. the FBI, and God knows who else over the last two years.
right now you're the most wanted man in the world.
I've seen you on TV?
Yeah! That's it! You're up to be the next Chief of Police!
I've been offered the job.
so, here we are the next Chief of the country's largest police force face-to-face with America's leading dissident.
N. Y.P. D. Is America's largest police force.
maybe we should keep our egos in check, shall we?
no, no, no, no! Don't shoot!
don't shoot! I want him alive.
why do you want me alive?
law enforcement has so much to learn from a mind like yours.
a- a-and judging from this...
you watched my Manifesto?
I did.
what part did you like the most?
specifically.
the articulate way you described how the events of September 24th affect our everyday lives.
a- and I agree entirely about how badly the quota system has undermined our values.
B- but what I don't understand is why you felt the need to kill those Paramedics.
well, if you had been paying attention, you would' heard when I said they were part of a corrupt structure.
Oh, right. Right.
B- b-but what about Russell Owens?
h- he was an invalid.
he threatened my mission.
and all the people at the Memorial?
is it really necessary to kill them?
well, I'm sorry if it seems so brutal, but I'm holding our society's hand to the stove.
sometimes violence is the only way to teach people how wrong they are.
what, you don't think I see you running?!
there goes another one of your cowardly Hispanic quota hires.
it's okay. Don't worry about him.
just for the record, I am not racist.
the system is racist.
a system I will change as Chief.
are you just saying that to save yourself? Because you're expendable!
okay, you know what?
why don't you just let them go, all right?
just let them go. You can hold onto me.
okay?
now, what about your Manifesto?!
if you kill us, you destroy your Manifesto.
on the other hand, if you let these men deactivate your bomb, not only will your powerful speech survive, but you can give it yourself.
you've already accomplished your mission.
people are listening to you.
journalists will be begging for interviews.
you'll be studied in history classes, and - and - and the quota system will change.
I will end it.
are you really gonna be the next Chief of Police? - Yes, I am.
and you're telling me that you're gonna be against quotas?
give me that!
give me it!
give me it! Give me it!
give me!
holy cr-a-a-a-ap!
does someone want to give me a hand with this, please?!
what did you do?
he's right.
sometimes violence is the only way to teach people how wrong they are.
Amen. Yeah, but on the day before they announce who's gonna be the next Chief of Police, you should have let me take the shot.
can we get a bomb tech here?!
maybe two!
or three! Or as many as you want to bring.
hurry.
in the scheme of things, this isn't so important, but we inventoried the evidence gathered at the parking structure yesterday, and Mason's Manifesto seems to be missing.
uh, well, I know in all the confusion that led to Mason's death, um, I accidentally dropped it, but I'm sure it'll turn up eventually.
might be just as well that it's missing.
otherwise it'd be running 24/7, giving that maniac credibility.
no joke. According to our guys, those tanks filled with Sarin could have killed thousands of people.
Yes, Commander?
excuse me, Chief.
uh, the Mayor would like to see you.
I- I'm sorry, Chief Johnson.
it's Chief Delk the Mayor requested.
nice.
yet another example, as if we needed one...
that life is not fair.
chief.
man.
I like the way that sounds
Los Angeles Chief of Police Thomas Delk.
well done.
are you all right?
Yeah, I think so.
you know, if you hadn't shot that guy and you weren't facing an F. I.D. investigation and a behavioral sciences inquiry, the Mayor might have appointed you.
it wasn't worth the risk.
uh, do you mind if I have a moment to myself?
sure. - Thanks.
as mayor of Los Angeles, I have made reform the cornerstone of my agenda.
and choosing from among the many qualified candidates who have offered themselves for this position, I was determined to choose an individual who would carry forward the momentum that outgoing police Chief Thompson has established.
thank you. And that's the truth.
you're welcome.
I can think of no better way to convey this city's appreciation and no finer person to choose for this job than Chief Thomas Delk.
thank you. Congratulations.
well, the old bastard's out and the new bastard's in.
thank you, Mayor.
I am honored, humbled, and deeply grateful to be standing with you.
you'd think killing one of the most wanted criminals in the country would be a good thing.
you would think, but you don't get ahead in this world by shooting dirtbags.
well, I, for one, am glad she took the shot, - although my ears are still ringing. - ...To continue that service...
you okay, Chief?
me? Well, maybe I'm a little disappointed.
...no time to waste...
maybe I'm a little relieved. I never know.
and I'll be announcing the head of that team in a few days.
well, whatever else happens...
yesterday was a hell of a day.
and, uh, if anybody needs me after this,
do you think they're gonna shut down Major Crimes?
after what you guys did for him yesterday?
well, we'll have to see, won't we?
...Strengths and weaknesses of our department and make the changes necessary to this vital agency.
Adele Crawford and her son,
Roger.
found dead in their Los Feliz home seven years ago.
says here her husband was on a plane to China for a business trip at the time of death.
but he had filed for divorce.
and after his wife and kid were found murdered, he didn't have to pay alimony or child support.
and he remarried four months later.
any signs of forced entry?
that should be right here.
uh, wait a minute.
there should be a whole nother box.
I must have left it down in records -- damn.
good morning, Chief.
good morning, everyone.
don't stop working on my account.
I don't remember Chief Thompson ever coming down here.
that's because he didn't.
Mm-hmm?
Oh. Chief.
chief Delk.
what a surprise.
what can I do for you?
over the last two months, 11 medical marijuana dispensaries have been robbed at gunpoint.
and Robbery/Homicide is no closer to finding the perpetrators than they were on day one.
Mm. Apparently, they're finding it hard to care about this little crime spree.
which is why I'm now assigning their investigation to your division.
Oh, uh, you may not be aware, but, um, we just picked up a case from Chief Pope.
the Crawford murder's seven years old.
it can wait a few more days.
you really think these robberies are that important?
armed robberies.
they may not have the violent impact of some of your regular cases, but if we don't stop them soon, they will.
Hey. This is nothing new.
every incoming Chief tries to be hands-on...
we know the pattern
one Chief centralizes everything...
then the next one tears it apart.
major Crimes could be on his hit list.
weren't you going down to records to get that box you forgot?
I'm going. I'm going.
there's an awful lot of material here.
but the basics never change.
the same three guys using the same M. O. at each dispensary.
uh, you're not concerned that we will be playing catch-up with Robbery/Homicide?
Robbery/Homicide, Counterterrorism,
major Crimes
I've always had my doubts about these specialized divisions.
people standing around waiting for a crime that matches the name of their department.
and with our hiring freeze,
I need every work hour to be well spent, even if I have to move people to do it
like, say, uh, you.
m-Me? Move me? Move me where?
I like to have people in their proper places.
you, for example, would make an excellent Assistant Chief of Operations.
that's Will Pope's job.
and I'd like someone with more hands-on experience in his position.
we may have elite divisions, Chief Johnson, but we don't have elite problems.
my idea of a Major Crime differs from that of Will Pope.
so now we're doing robberies?
armed robberies, Lieutenant.
11 in a row by the same 3 men.
that doesn't sound like a major crime to you?
now, let's take a look at the pattern.
our 3-man team, all wearing motorcycle helmets, hits a medical marijuana dispensary once every three to four days.
so we're due right now, Chief.
Yeah, they target dispensaries with light security -- they rush in in the morning before customers get in their way.
I have video up of the last robbery.
our robbers wait just out of view of the security cameras until someone comes out, then they go in.
the two with pistols cover the staff.
then the third comes in and covers the camera with gold spray paint.
why wait for someone to leave?
why don't they just enter directly?
most marijuana dispensaries have electronic security doors that only unlock from the inside.
and you know this because...
my mom has a prescription for pot.
what's wrong with her?
insomnia and glaucoma.
I-I have to guide her to the door sometimes.
ever buy anything?
how do you think he got the name "Buzz"?
very funny.
no, Lieutenant, you can't shop for pot unless you have a prescription from a doctor and a photo I. D.
and, uh, does your mother claim that this maryjane actually helps her?
I don't know, but she sleeps all the time, and she doesn't complain anymore...
...About anything.
well
okay, so their pattern is every three or four days.
what else do these 11 stores have in common?
other than free love and patchouli oil?
um, Chief, they're all cash heavy and with lots of inventory.
I mean, after each robbery, the dispensaries are reporting losses in the five figures and 10 to 15 pounds of pot missing.
what's the street value of medical marijuana?
$5, 000 to $20, 000 a pound, and there are always buyers.
hmm. Better than robbing a bank.
and I've checked all the witness statements, Chief.
and even though our robbers were wearing motorcycle helmets, no one actually saw a motorcycle leave the scene.
okay, so all the victims of these robberies
Victims"?!
don't you mean "Drug dealers"?
lieutenant, these dispensaries are considered legal by the state.
we are sworn to protect them. - Bull.
Hey. What happened to our cold case?
uh, Chief Delk put it back in the freezer.
and he assigned us to a string of armed robberies at marijuana dispensaries.
Oh?
anyone tell Pope?
Delk is changing the definition of Major Crimes.
he's blurring the lines between you and Robbery/Homicide, and not only that, he's targeting me, too.
well, he won't fire you.
he could demote me to Commander, which cuts my pension and puts me at the same rank as Taylor.
that can't happen.
well, do you have any outside offers?
uh, yeah, some.
Yeah, New York, Chicago -- all private sector.
better money, of course.
but nothing here.
I can't move out of state with my kids unless their mother goes, too.
why are you asking me about my other offers?
did Delk say something?
did he outright offer you my job?
why would you even say that?
because he likes you...
obviously, and taking you off a case that I gave you
that's a pretty clear indication my time at the L. A.P. D. has come to a close.
regardless, it is imperative that your division clear up these armed robberies.
Why?
a failure in a case like this would be just the excuse Delk needs to break up Major Crimes.
which, right now, is a vital part of my resume.
Yeah. Come in.
excuse me, Chief. Uh...
we have another robbery at a dispensary, and this one came with a murder.
of course it did.
uh, we'll handle this.
we will.
Hey, Chief. Gold spray paint.
just like the other robberies.
well, our 3-man team, all wearing motorcycle helmets, busted in here an hour ago.
that sad sack over there in the corner, that's Sam Dodson, co-founder of this little weed stand.
commander Taylor, would you babysit Mr. Dodson for a moment, please?
thank you. Commander Taylor...
lieutenant Flynn, one name on the sign-in sheet for today -- John Park.
maybe he's the man who let in our robbers.
I'll go find him, Chief. Thank you.
uh, Chief, here.
watch -- watch --watch the glass, huh?
all right.
now, there was no camera found in this room, which means at least they were smart enough not to tape their drug deals.
the body?
right in here.
meet who used to be Shea Collins.
chief Thomas Delk.
what in the hell is he doing here?
chief.
I told you this was a major crime.
and you were right.
you were going to tell us about the victim, Lieutenant.
right.
Shea Collins, Chiefs.
um, 36 years old.
co-owned this dispensary with Sam Dodson, who is in the lobby.
two shots -- one to the chest, one to the head,
Collins goes down here.
9mm casings over here, and the shooter was standing right...Here.
excuse me, Chief.
no. Excuse me.
I should have put you on this case days ago.
my instincts were right.
my timing was wrong. I'm sorry.
uh, no need to apologize.
the M. O. is the same as the other robberies?
uh, yes...
except for the murder, which you predicted.
I'm gonna head in and, uh, talk to the witness, see what he has to say.
pardon me, sir.
chief, Sam Dodson, the co-owner.
um, I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Dodson...
and I know that this is a bad time, but could you walk us through what happened today?
Yeah, we opened at 11: 00 a. m. and right after our first customer left, three guys wearing motorcycle helmets jammed guns in our faces.
one of them took the money, and the other two went in the stockroom.
and I was on the floor, facedown on the ground, uh, like they told me.
but Shea
he just went crazy.
he was screaming, fighting.
and, uh...
they shot him...
twice.
I did nothing to help him.
what did the robbers take from the store today?
um, $50, 000 cash, and we normally keep about 20 pounds of product on hand.
chief.
found this flier on the front desk. - Thank you.
I know the police think we're all a bunch of stoners.
I have an MBA, okay?
Shea was a cannabis expert.
I mean, that's why people came here
for Shea's Lounge.
what the hell is that?
Shea's Lounge? Uh...
Shea's Lounge
it's our showpiece strain.
nobody else had it.
it's a 40% indica, 60% sativa hybrid.
it's like a cross between Skywalker and super skunk with a little ruderalis thrown in to reinforce the thc content.
Shea created it.
did he apply for the nobel prize?
it says here, "Beware of anyone "Coming in at night, "Talking on their cell and browsing for a while "Without buying anything.
they'll be back the next morning to rob you"?
W-why? Is that a problem?
well, this is information the L. A.P. D. didn't have.
if the robbers were casing stores
it was just a theory that Shea came up with by talking to other dispensary owners.
I always thought he was being a little paranoid, but...
I guess that's what happens when you're under attack with no police assistance.
Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Dodson.
the L. A.P. D. has handled this case seriously from the beginning.
thank you, Commander.
why don't you go tell the press what I'm gonna tell Mr. Dodson?
we have Major Crimes, our most elite division, working this investigation, and we will solve this case.
uh, Chief Delk, in order to make good on that promise,
I'm gonna need two things
and that is a forensic botanist and a sealed crime scene.
you want to seal this place and post an officer outside 'round the clock?
that seems drastic and expensive.
well, I'm trying to do what you want, which is solve this case in a hurry.
so I need someone who can distinguish between different strains of marijuana.
I also need a sealed crime scene
fine.
fine.
Mr. Dodson...
I'm sorry, but you're not going to have access to your store for a few days.
you're using this tragedy as an excuse shut us down.
Oh, please.
the L. A.P. D. has already wasted enough time protecting you hippies and your maryjane.
lieutenant Provenza! Lieute
I'd like to speak to you for a moment, please.
did you just say "Hippies" And "Maryjane"?
Yes, I did.
how old are you?
six Chiefs and counting, which is how I know that if you deal drugs, you vastly increase your chances you'll end up dead.
I'm low on sympathy here.
that's too bad.
because as of now, you're the L. A.P. D. liaison to the medical-marijuana community for the rest of this investigation.
what? - And I expect you to meet with the dispensary owners this evening and educate them about today's events.
you can't be serious.
do I look high to you?
we think this might be the guy checking out the stores before the robbery.
entered last night. Used a fake name to sign in.
talks on the phone. Didn't buy anything.
he's practically wearing a burka.
he looks Caucasian.
generic clothes.
probably not a gang member, Chief.
if he's casing the place, his phone may be on video mode.
but I can't enlarge it enough to see.
he's probably photographing the placement of the security cameras.
buzz, could you get to the robbery footage, please?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry. They never shut off the cameras.
I have to fast-forward through the whole night.
can we watch both videos side by side?
okay, there. Pause.
the guy from the night before is the same physical type as our spray painter.
and he's wearing the same cowboy boots.
so the flier's right.
this man cases the store, and then, the next morning, he's the first one in and sprays the cameras.
and here's the footage from the exterior camera.
pause it there.
this is our guy from this morning's sign-in sheet, John Park, opening the door for the robbers.
chief.
lieutenant Flynn picked John Park up at his house about an hour ago.
he's 27 years old and temps as a graphic artist when he...works at all.
what's going on in there?
well, Lieutenant Provenza is briefing the dispensary owners on today's events.
see, Provenza? A lot of them aren't hippies.
Yeah, well, I promise you, Tao, in every one of their closets, somewhere, there's a tie-dyed shirt.
uh, which interview room is Mr. Park in?
Neither...apparently, Mr. Park wanted some...snacks.
lieutenant, is he...
as a kite. -Great.
Hi!
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, L. A.P. D.
no, thank you.
um, may I ask you why you need a prescription for medical marijuana?
anxiety.
I used to be, like, tense.
and was there a cause for this stress?
Oh, yeah.
a year ago, I was managing a Kinkos.
and then I got laid off.
thrown back into the rat race.
couldn't sleep.
a-and what brought you in to the dispensary this morning?
Oh, I woke up feeling... Blah.
I just wanted to grab a brownie and put on my thinking cap.
I was gonna get three, 'cause I really wanted to relax.
but Shea said that half of one would do the trick, and I shouldn't be wasteful.
but it was just so delicious.
I went outside, and I ate the whole thing.
God, Shea is dead!
what is that like?
he threatened to kick me out once.
he was a cool cat, though.
he invented Shea's Lounge.
Shea's Lounge.
get it? Like...
...the thing.
what I'm most interested in is what happened after you left the store.
I went across the street to get a sandwich.
it was a Turkey and avocado.
I sat on the curb to eat it.
and...it had cilantro.
will you forget the sandwich?
we're interested in the guys with the motorcycle helmets who you let in the store on your way out.
Oh, the guys with the motorcycle helmets. - Yeah.
well, what about them?
you saw three men with motorcycle helmets run right past you.
did you not find that odd?
I just thought they were safety conscious.
it is kind of weird that they were wearing helmets in the car, though.
you saw them leave in an automobile?
Yeah, uh, an old one.
it was orange, like a big ball of fire.
those guys were in a hurry, too.
and gunshots.
loud!
okay. You know what?
I'm gonna ask you what may seem like a really stupid question.
there are no stupid questions.
Oh, thank you...
so much.
uh, did you get the license plate off the car?
what car?
the orange one, that looked like a big ball of fire.
Oh, you saw that, too!
did you get the plate or not?!
Yeah. Yeah. I got the plate.
it said..."California.
uh, pardon me.
chief, one of the so-called dispensary owners says that a guy came into his store tonight, was looking around while he was talking on his phone, then he left without buying anything.
but their M. O.'s every three or four days.
I know that, Chief. I know.
that's the reason I showed the owner the surveillance tapes we had from last night.
positive I. D. wearing exactly the same hat and glasses.
okay. They're escalating.
first the murder, now they're breaking the pattern.
tomorrow morning, they are going to rob that store.
what's this all about?
first, I'm gonna tell you something...
that will make you happy.
your forensic botanist has been requisitioned, and we're flying him in from Washington for your murder.
next...
I'm gonna tell you something that will make us both happy.
I heard, from a very reliable source, that Delk...
offered you the job of Assistant Chief.
Congratulations.
what's wrong?
well, champagne's for celebrating, and there's nothing to celebrate.
Joel!
Joel, that food's not for you!
for heaven's sakes.
I don't know who your reliable source is, but Delk didn't offer me Will's job.
Really?
because my reliable source is Delk.
well, then, he's not as reliable as you think.
you know, if it weren't for Will bringing me out here, we wouldn't even be married.
I think a little gratitude would be nice.
are you kidding me?
that's like saying you and I wouldn't be together if my ex-wife hadn't divorced me.
you want to give her a call and say "Thanks"?
I would never call Elaine in a million years.
Cindy." "Cindy." For God's sake, my ex-wife's name is Cindy.
I don't even know anyone named Elaine!
well, whatever Delk told you,
I'm not even in contention for Will's job until I arrest three homicidal robbers.
Yeah, that's not what Delk says.
well, who are you gonna believe -- me or Delk?
why do you want me in Will's job so badly anyhow?
because I don't want you chasing robbers and other heavily armed criminals anymore.
and if you were Assistant Chief of Operations,
I wouldn't have to spend so much time worrying about you
like I will all day tomorrow while you're staking out some pot shop, waiting for a bunch of murderers to strike again.
why can't you let the undercover detectives handle this?
because I want these guys alive, and S. I.S. Shoots first and asks questions never.
and I'll be sitting in a surveillance van the whole time anyhow.
and the surveillance van is gonna be parked three blocks away?
ah -- and the surveillance van is going to be parked
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
the surveillance van will be parked three blocks away.
thank you.
thank you.
can we move the van a little closer?
not without going inside.
okay, Buzz.
l. A.P. D. appreciates you letting us use your store for public-safety reasons.
we shouldn't be here too long.
Oh, looky here.
well our witness was right.
all right, look sharp, everyone.
we've got company.
thank you, Lieutenant.
let's keep our guests comfortable.
detective Sanchez, go ahead and open the store.
lieutenant Tao, you're up.
and now Tao's gonna show us if his theory about our robbers using an innocent customer to let them in is true.
you guys ready?
ready as we're gonna be.
I think we have a problem.
detective Gabriel, buzz him in.
but be careful -- he could be one of their crew.
Ben Schwartz.
Ben Schwartz.
welcome to Kind Buds.
come on back.
thank you.
Ben -- it's not
do I have to type in his full name?
does it matter if he's a Benjamin or a Bennett?
here. Let me.
no, no, no, no.
I should do the typing.
chief, I do this all the time.
just give me one second. Okay?
what's better -- the razzmatazz or the gypsy's dreams?
the razzmatazz flips you upside down and bends your mind with color.
you know what I mean?
but the gypsy's dreams
it's more like... "I'm going to the supermarket, "But really I'm on an epic journey of self-discovery" Kind of ride.
Yeah, but they both get you pretty high.
Oh, look at that.
okay, no criminal record for Mr. Schwartz, so he's most likely not part of their crew.
lieutenant Tao, go ahead and exit the store.
his helmet is on, so they'll be coming in on the next exit.
when our innocent bystander,
Mr. Schwartz, comes out, make sure you get him out of harm's way.
will do, Chief.
customer is on his way out.
here we go.
get on the ground! Okay, okay, okay!
all right! All right! All right!
get down!
this better not be like yesterday.
we're here to see it's not.
this place is aces!
Oh, my God!
this stash is huge!
come on. Come on, guys. Come on!
get the car started!
first suspect's leaving.
go, go, come on.
okay, wait for it.
wait for it.
go, go, go.
careful, careful.
get down!
show me your hands!
Oh, that was really well done, everyone!
I think we're good!
I hear congratulations are in order.
who'd you hear that from?
commander Taylor.
how else do we hear about anything in this building?
just back from ballistics with the guns the robbers were using.
and I'm afraid I have bad news.
the guns don't match?
I'm afraid I have really bad news.
here, Chief. Take this.
chief Delk?
please take mine.
not to worry.
just a little demonstration.
it's Tao.
he could give us a warning next time.
the window's fine.
look! Window's fine!
the guns are fake.
the guns are fake!
Oh, Chief Delk.
transition going well?
always a few bumps in the road.
change takes time.
well, I'm here if you need me.
thank you. I'll keep that in mind.
somebody mentioned there were some complications with the ballistics on Chief Johnson's murder investigation.
the main complication was not putting Major Crimes on the case earlier.
well, now that you've altered their charter, that shouldn't be a problem again.
anyway, you're right. Ballistics don't match.
but a forensic botanist confirmed the killers possessed a small amount of Shea's Lounge.
that's a unique plant sold only at our victim's store.
so I don't even need to hear these guys say they did it.
well, you may not, but Chief Johnson will.
all right, our spray painter's name is A. J. Clark.
and he had no rap sheet up until today.
he's been unemployed for 18 months, but before that, he worked as a prop master, so he'd have access to dozens of different guns through different armories serving the film industry.
the other two guys with the fake guns are unemployed stunt men
Greg Lapham and Lou Wilson.
between the two of them, a couple B&E's
and an assault.
look.
they've been mirandized.
we have enough evidence to book them all for murder.
Yeah, but not to make it stick.
one of them had a real gun yesterday, and I need to find it.
line them up, please.
you got it, Chief.
Hello, Greg.
I'm deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I want a lawyer.
you're sitting right here.
Lou, I'm Deputy Chief
one word...
lawyer.
I want one.
I-- - Stop! Just listen.
before you say anything, you should know that your friends are being very cooperative.
there's three of you, and I got one deal to cut.
do you want it or not?
the other guys are... Talking?
at this very moment.
and how I file against y'all with the D. A.
depends on which one of you is the most truthful.
Mr. Clark...
how well do you trust your partners?
because unlike them, you were caught blue-handed, and Detective Sanchez and Lieutenant Flynn are interviewing them right now.
how's your interview going?
good. How's yours? - Good.
how do the three of y'all know each other?
I worked props on a tv show -- "Cop Lawyer, M. D.
and Greg and Lou did stunts.
we all thought it was kind of a lock.
lasted two episodes.
a year and a half later, I still wasn't working.
then Greg and Lou called me.
I knew it was all their fault.
I could tell from the way they were behaving.
and they're blaming it all on you.
what? You're kidding.
saying it was all your idea
the robberies.
I told my whole division that you were mostly just along for the ride.
am I wrong?
N-No! No, you're right.
that's your cue. - They're the ones who came to me wanting to get prop guns.
said they'd figured out a way to make some money.
God. And I agreed to go along with it.
so stupid.
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself.
you were desperate...
unemployed...
afraid.
they took advantage of you.
they did, didn't they?
making you case all the stores, forcing you to leave first during the robberies in case anyone was waiting outside.
don't say nothing till our lawyer gets here.
they talked me into doing nearly everything for them.
Oh, you're the prop master.
you should make all the fake I. D.S.
what's he doing? - He's talking.
hope he doesn't say anything about murder.
murder?
what murder?
I even had to sell most of the pot we stole myself.
Mr. Clark -- may I call you A. J?
A. J. I need the truth about what happened yesterday.
I...cased the place like usual...
and was, like, thrilled to see how little security they had.
I mean, do you know what Shea's Lounge is worth on the street?
I mean, they were practically giving it away.
so we thought, "Why not take it?
I'm not talking about the robberies.
I'm talking about the murder.
now, you weren't carrying a gun.
so was it Greg or Lou?
the guns were fake.
we didn't murder anyone! They were fake!
you invoked your right to counsel.
we can't talk to you about anything until your lawyer gets here.
then we disinvoke or -- or uninvoke! Yeah.
I hope it's not too late.
too late for what?!
this is a mistake! We didn't murder anybody!
those were prop guns! Those guns were fake!
that's not makeup...
and this...
is not movie magic.
if the guns were fake, how did someone get shot?
look, uh...
I...
I-I want a lawyer.
shut up!
chief, we got them to revoke.
but it's the same old lies.
why won't you guys believe us?!
when you rob 13 dispensaries at gunpoint and you murder someone, you kind of lose your credibility.
you want me to believe you? Tell me the truth. Now.
we didn't murder that guy.
we used fake guns. Okay?
we always use fake guns so it won't count as armed robbery.
you know that's not true, right?
uh, don't treat me like an idiot.
I worked on a law show for two years.
must not have been a very good one.
listen to me, you morons.
in California, it counts as armed robbery if people even think you have a gun.
luckily we're not charging you with robbery.
we are arresting you both for murder in the first degree.
look -- the second we saw that stock room was empty, we booked, okay?
the guy was alive when we left.
okay. Same old story.
you're both under arrest for murder. Let's go.
What?! - No!
you're making a huge mistake!
Aah, aah, easy!
you'll see those guns were fake!
we didn't do a thing!
once we search their places, - find that gun... - If we find the gun.
...we got them.
there's no way a jury won't convict.
you should be happy about this, Chief.
happy?
why should I be happy?
cause Delk is over the moon.
but he also told me you didn't stop by his office to discuss your promotion to Assistant Chief.
all right. You know what? I'm just gonna say it.
I don't like Will Pope.
he still has feelings for you.
that's ridiculous. That is absolutely not true.
Fritzi, please don't.
you are the only one who doesn't see it.
and you know what? Not only do I not like that you work with him,
I don't like it that you're spending more time worrying about what Pope wants than what I want.
well, that is absolutely not true.
no? - No.
when it comes to work, I spend most of my time wondering what I want, and you and Pope just don't enter into it.
and since you just told me something that you don't like, here's something I just hate.
and that is when my husband tells me who I should be working with.
no, wait a minute. This is not what I'm doing here.
that is exactly what you're doing!
and -- and you're telling me what job I should want...
when I'm happy where I am!
and the best way for me to hold on to my job is for Will to hold on to his.
well, that's not gonna happen.
I know you've always thought of yourselves as partners.
but let me tell you something -- Pope is out.
and you don't want to push him over the cliff, the extra money isn't worth it to you
that's fine.
but eventually you are gonna watch Pope moving all of his stuff out of his office, and Delk might replace him with someone you can't stand.
how would you feel if Taylor was sitting behind that desk instead of you?
huh? Have you ever thought about that?
moving all of his stuff out?
I...
do you really think Will still has feelings for me?
Yes.
well, I'll think about how to deal with that.
I promise.
may I borrow your glasses?
Yes.
uh, yeah, Detective Gabriel.
would you call, uh, Mr. Dodson, please?
let him know that...
we can unseal his crime scene in about two hours and give it back to him?
and I need a search warrant.
Thanks.
I believe this belongs to you.
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
you all right?
get down!
Hey! Stay down! Freeze!
get up! Aah!
put your hands behind your back!
you have the right to remain silent.
I didn't do anything. I'm innocent.
you have the right to an attorney.
you can't do this! This is entrapment!
...one will be appointed to you by the state.
do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?
detective, could you...
I told you this was a bad idea!
Yes, I know you did.
thank you so much for reminding me.
I can't -- could y'all just figure out some way to get me down?
thank you so much. Mr. Dodson?
do you understand these rights?
y-you guys have this all wrong.
Shea hid our stuff up there.
no, Mr. Dodson, you put it up here, because you knew you were going to be robbed.
how would I have known that?
because you saw the robbers come in and case the store, just like Shea said would happen in the flier.
but you couldn't get your inventory out, because the security cameras were on all the time.
and how would you have explained that to Shea?
no, you told him you put it up here, to protect it.
lieutenant. - Here you go. Drop it.
then, when the robbers left emp-handed, you shot your partner and made a big score.
no, no. Shea shot himself.
twice? And then hid the gun in the attic?
I don't think so.
okay, what possible reason would I have to kill Shea?
maybe because he was talking people out of buying more than they needed...
and undercharging for Shea's Lounge.
maybe he cared more about the people who came here and less about sales.
chief... I hate to say this, but I don't think we're gonna be able to get high enough.
lieutenants Flynn and Provenza, would y'all please charge Mr. Dodson for murder in the first degree, with the special circumstance of financial gain?
a-and let Chief Pope know that I'll be up to see him just as soon as I get down.
will do.
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.
chief...
you're gonna have to jump. Yeah.
Really?
we'll catch ya.
we're gonna -- you jump on 3.
all right? So you're gonna go 1, 2...
then you're gonna jump.
all right? Here we go.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
chief.
I heard the good news.
very impressed with all of your work.
love turning the case over to the D. A.
with a bow on it.
uh, if I may, Chief, that's two bows.
major Crimes also collected their three armed robbers.
thank you, Commander. I stand corrected.
great work on both cases.
and you're never gonna believe this.
the killer turned out to be a guy...
who sold drugs.
is that so?
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. A-and get this.
the murderer said he did it because his partner wasn't commercial enough.
I know.
I know, it's shocking to find drug dealers shooting each other over money.
next thing you know, husbands will be killing their wives for being unfaithful.
what a world.
okay.
don't let me hold up your work.
will you excuse me?
chief Johnson.
what are you doing here?
I-I wasn't completely honest with you yesterday.
about?
chief Delk.
he offered me your job.
I see.
I'm not going to take it, but I thought you should know that he's looking to replace you.
well
thanks -- thanks for the heads-up.
so...
now we know for sure.
I guess that's it, then.
you're not going to fight back?
Brenda, I think at this point, it's either jump or be pushed.
what do you want me to do?
don't jump. Not yet.
Why?
I need you.
I need you holding the line on this reorganization.
I don't know how we'll manage without you.
okay.
I'll stay.
I'll...
I'll see it through to the bitter end.
well, thank you. I appreciate that. I do.
and do you realize that's what it's likely to be?
a bitter end.
well, we'll see, won't we?
major crimes.
Hey, chief? - yes?
Dr. Morales says there's a dead guy at a funeral home.
very funny.
seriously, there's a body at weaver funeral home without a death certificate.
well, ask Dr. Morales to send in a coroner's investigator.
he did, but the dead guy's family doesn't want him to examine the body.
who do you think should handle it, chief?
uh, detective julio sanchez?
you have been served.
what, again?
well, it's probably nothing.
lieutenant louie m. Provenza?
18
deputy chief brenda leigh johnson?
you've been served.
what's going on? - Lieutenant michael tao?
getting wallpapered, commander.
Francis b. Watson? - What? Why me?
why "francis"? That's the real question.
lieutenant andrew flynn?
Yeah, yeah.
a wrongful-death civil suit filed on behalf of turell baylor?
we didn't kill the guy.
Yeah, but he was beaten to death right after we dropped him off at his house.
Turell murdered an old man and his 8-year-old grandson.
who cares what happened to him?
commander russell taylor?
you have been served.
okay, that's it.
wait.
what about me? - Sorry. That's all I got.
you talked to the baylors' attorney already?
What'd you say?
are you kidding? Are you serious right now?
Gabriel, it's flynn!
he's paranoid for a living.
of course I'm paranoid.
Raydor's been down here grilling us for weeks.
look, gentlemen, we're not allowed to discuss the case, but what icantell you is that they're only really interested inme.
funny way to show it.
Hey, buddy.
what are you still doing here?
Oh, I'm serving subpoenas today, and I'm also the attorney representing the mother of turell baylor...
you're the what?!
...in her suit against the city, the l. a.p. d.and almost everyone in this room.
my name is peter goldman.
and it's a great pleasure meeting you all.
uh, now that I have your squad on record saying turell baylor deserved to die,
I was wondering if I could ask your detectives a few simple follow-up questions.
No! They're on their way to a crime scene of a very serious murder at...
weaver funeral home.
lieutenant.
right! Right! Let's go!
hurry up.
get out of here.
clear out.
if you could spare me just a moment - Goodbye, Mr Goldman.
I can't help you. Goodbye.
I am an officer of the court, sworn to uphold the law, and, just like you, I am only trying to get to the truth.
and a $20 million settlement.
when suspects die without due process, people lose confidence in the justice system.
goodbye, Mr. Goldman.
there were two other cops in the car when you drove turell baylor home.
give me their names, and I won't depose your whole squad.
I've already heard some of your people were unhappy with the way you treated turell.
nice try, Mr. Goldman. But there's nothing you could say that would make me suspect my fellow officers.
just a friendly heads-up.
goodbye" didn't work. Let's try "get out!" now.
come on. Come on.
let me walk you back to the elevator. Let's go.
it's all right. I know my way around.
pleasure meeting you.
walk.
what? I'm walking! I'm walking.
excuse me. Wait. Wait, wait. I'm terry weaver.
are you gentlemen all from the police?
lieutenant provenza, major crimes.
major crimes?
Oh, my gosh.
listen, I'm the funeral director here and - Six of you?
six - oh, my gosh.
there's been a terrible miscommunication.
did someone carry a body in here without a death certificate?
okay, listen.
cliff wycoff - he's a minister.
pastor wycoff died of natural causes in his home.
and his family brought him to the funeral home.
have you examined the body?
Oh, no, no.
I would never do that before the death was certified.
that's why I called the coroner.
but we don't need the police.
Mr. Weaver, what are you doing?
is the body in there?
front of the chapel, yes.
in here.
all right, l.a. p.d. Everybody back.
step back. Step back. - why does he have... no, no. Why does he have a camera?
no, no, no, no. This is wrong.
what are you taking pictures of my dad for?
calm down, sir. We mean no disrespect.
army or navy?
I'm a lance corporal, united states marines.
great.'cause if you interfere, we'll call the m. p.s at camp pendleton, and you'll become their problem.
so, should I proceed with the liver-temping exam?
well, if you can do it before they start the wake, yes.
man: Is everything all right?
no visible head trauma.
but I see petechiae.
and ligature on the neck.
so, strangulation of some sort.
I'd call thatunnatural.
91
that puts time of death about two, three hours ago.
um, gabriel, come with me.
um, you the wife?
Yes. - Yeah, well, I need to talk to you right now.
this is no way to treat people in mourning.
well, I don't know about that, lady. - Excuse me, lieutenant.
Mrs. Wycoff, you have the l. a.p. d.'s deepest sympathies in this very difficult time.
perhaps there's someplace we could talk in private?
Yes.
lieutenant, she may not realize she did something wrong
she may also have just strangled her husband.
she's a preacher's wife.
you have to approach her a certain way.
and you would know how to do that better than I would because?
because when I was a kid, I went to church four times a week.
four times a week?
twice on sunday, prayer meetings on wednesday, choir practice on friday.
all right. All right. You win.
but hurry up.
I'm not waiting here till jesus comes back.
Mrs Wycoff...I know you're taking care of many people right now, and we will be sensitive to your spiritual obligation, but I also need you to be sensitive to yourlegalsituation.
and it would help us out greatly if you could just tell us what happened to your husband today.
Clifford was, um, battling depression.
his faith was strong, but it...
sometimes it's hard to know what god wants.
God didn't want this.
my husband hung himself in the garage at our house.
I am so very sorry.
I know how hard that must have been to say.
but, um... Can you tell me why you didn't contact the authorities?
I should have, I know, but I didn't want anyone in the church to know.
okay. We can certify your husband's death.
but I need written consent to search your home and your garage. Okay?
thank you.
here. Let yourselves in.
I'm taking the family to church if you need me.
of course. Thank you.
thank you.
I just came up with the pastor's most recent credit-card charge.
uh, this guy didn't die at home, lieutenant.
starlight motor lodge.
he checked in at 10: 00 a. m. This morning, and he still hasn't checked out.
Yeah, well, that depends on your point of view.
also, someone made a call from the minister's room at the starlight around 11: 02 a. m. which would be just before the time of death.
well, find out who that call went to, mike.
Yeah, chief?
um, we've got a situation.
manager said the victim was a regular, chief.
held the room with a credit card and then paid with cash when he left.
Oh, the old cheater's trick.
so I hear.
maybe he just need a quiet place to reflect.
by the hour? - get it all.
make sure it gets all clean.
Hey, guys, hold up. Hold up.
what did you say?
make sure it gets all cleaned up.
stay back, buzz.
I said make sure you empty the trash.
sir, l.a. p.d!
drop it. Drop the weapon. Drop the weapon!
dear god! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
what the hell?! - Don't shoot!
we were just cleaning up.
ma'am, put the spray cleaner down and step away from the sink.
it's a hot-glue gun, chief.
Agluegun?
I just fixed that lamp, and now look at it.
well, we have a pair of men's pants here, a,uh, shirt, belt.
and what have we here?
now, who doesthis belong to?
y'all wouldn't happen to know a pastor cliff wycoff, would you?
he was our son-in-law.
on a little secret...
only my wife knows.
your pastor's not perfect.
Jesus knows that I'm a sinner!
he loves me in spite of the fact that I'm human!
pause it, buzz.
what kind of a woman asks her parents to clean up the motel room where her husband was having sex?
tao.
looks like the pastor's lady friend left in a hurry.
anything from the motel security cameras?
strictly decoration, chief.
somebody for sure called his wife's cellphone from the motel room.
chief, flynn and gabriel picked up Mrs. Wycoff and her family at their church
chief johnson?
they're on their way back here, but, uh, there's a bit of an issue.
okay.
excuse me, gentlemen.
I want to know the moment that the rest of the wycoff family arrives, please.
thank you.
so, why were you talking to peter goldman this morning?
uh, goldman pretended to be a process server, and he threw subpoenas all around the murder room, and I ordered him out. I wasn't talking to him.
because I understand he was trying to offer you a deal.
how do you know that?
commander taylor!
when, when, when are you going to get him out of my murder room?
I can't bear it.
look, will, I don't - I don't even rember what goldman was talking about.
well, allow me to refresh your memory.
he was asking who was with you in the car when you dropped off turell baylor at his house.
now, why would he be asking that?
was something said in that car that could get us in even more trouble?
no. Goldman served everyone a subpoena, except for gabriel, to turn us against each other and make us all paranoid.
Gabriel didn't get served?
you think he's already talked to goldman?
paranoia part seems to be working.
look, will, this is all about me.
not all about you.
I got subpoenaed, too, and i'm in this now up to my neck.
as is the city, the department, your entire division.
you know what? The next time goldman comes into your murder room, will you just go into your office and lock the door and call the city attorney?
which is what you should have done this morning.
or, better yet, find yourself a personal attorney.
maybe he can make you understand how serious this has become.
because nobody else is getting through to you.
come in.
chief.
uh, chief johnson, I have the rest of the wycoff family waiting for you.
thank you, david.
chief, I know everyone thinks it's weird that I didn't get served, - but I just want you to know I would never - David, let's stop worrying about gossip and start concentrating on this case.
what were the wycoffs doing when you found them?
uh, yeah, well, when we finally caught up with them at the church, they were driving their minivan around the parking lot, running over computers.
so, this is what's left of the church's entire i. t. Division.
this is what's left of my desk.
there's probably a record in there of our victim's little love connection.
well, this looks like an organized hit.
but who did the organizing?
I'm ready to throw them all in jail.
I wish it were that easy.
what - how did you get back in this building?
Oh, I never left.
and I'm sorry to disturb your...
investigation here.
just, uh, wanted to drop back by, see if you'd had a chance to think over my little proposal.
I have.
I propose you stand still, let lieutenant tao take your picture, and tell security to arrest you if you ever come back in this building again.
get - All right. Okay. Just...
call me if you change your mind on the deal.
detective gabriel...
looking sharp.
I - I have never, ever met that man in my life before today!
well, he sure as hell knowsyou.
that's enough.
now, we all know david.
we've worked with him for years.
he's a good guy. He's a great cop.
and he's as loyal as they come.
or else he's a snitch.
man, what - At any rate, he's the only one of us who hasn't been subpoenaed, so he must have done something right.
thank you, lieutenant provenza, for that morale booster.
meanwhile, I'd like to talk to Mrs. Wycoff.
detective gabriel?
let's start with how you knew where to find your husband's body.
he, um...He called me from that horrible motel to say goodbye.
the number showed up on my cellphone he told you he was going to kill himself?
I begged him not to, but he wouldn't listen to me.
uh, after he hung up the phone, I - I rushed over to find him, but...
it was too late.
he was hanging by his belt from the sprinkler pipe.
he felt he'd let me down, his church down.
he let god down.
well, you certainly letmedown, Mrs. Wycoff,'cause I allowed you to spend some quiet time with your family, and you used that time to destroy all your husband's computers from the church.
I did that, yes.
it was only to protect the members of our congregation.
protect them from what?
our members trusted my husband with their secrets.
the law doesn't recognize the confidentiality of protestant ministers.
God does.
we may not have legal rights, but we have spiritual ones.
those rights do not include having your parents sterilize the motel room where your husband died.
here are a few things that they couldn't sweep under the rug.
any idea how these came to be there?
I assume he was with another woman.
someone he knew?
or a prostitute, maybe?
please, i'm begging you - Do not sensationalize my husband's suicide.
I'm not sensationalizing anything, Mrs. Wycoff.
but I absolutely need to find this woman who was with your husband at that motel room.
she ran away without her shoes and her underwear, and that worries me.
I don't even know if she's still alive.
or should I be checking with another funeral home somewhere?
I wouldn't know.
it's in god's hands...
not mine.
boy, oh, boy!
they're all singing from the same hymnal.
anybody say anything about the girlfriend?
nobody knows nothing about nothing but suicide.
Mrs. Wycoff's orchestrated this whole thing.
she's practically daring me to arrest her.
you know what? I say let her go.
Why?
so she can destroy more evidence?
no. She doesn't think we're questioning her.
she thinks we're questioning her faith and her beliefs.
that's only gonna make her stonewall.
but if we back off, who knows?
maybe she'll try to contact the other woman on her own or lead us to her body.
it's either that, or we try those red shoes on all the fair ladies of the land.
excuse me, chief.
Dr. Morales is ready for you.
okay. Thank you.
uh, lieutenant, I want 24-hour surveillance on every member of that family.
can you arrange it, please?
Oh, love to. - Thank you.
Oh, and, uh, detective gabriel, I need you with me, please.
so, sir, did she say anything to you about what goldman's proposal was?
no. But whatever that asshole suggested, she's not letting gabriel out of her sight.
in my opinion, the ligature wounds are consistent with the belt found at the scene.
so hedidhang himself.
only if he was somehow able to desperately scratch at his throat for air, severely bruise his knee, and, finally, sprain his ankle in the process.
that swelling had to happen before the guy died.
so you're saying therewasa struggle.
I'm saying that, at some point, the victim found himself flailing on the floor.
so, what, the belt was being pulled one way...
and our victim was trying to pull it another, yes.
doctor, what are these?
Oh, yes. At first I thought those were broken blood vessels, but when I swabbed them, it appeared to be some kind of red dye.
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
well, looks like we found cinderella.
Yeah, but who turned him into a pumpkin?
are you going to work?
that was detective gabriel.
he's following the widow wycoff to church this morning.
at 6: 00 a. m?- That's where she and her family go
home and church, church and home.
that woman - She honestly thinks she's somehow above the law, that the justice system just doesn't apply to her.
speaking of which, did you ever contact that attorney captain raydor suggested to you?
no. Kitty! I mean joel, joel, joel, joel, off the table.
I really think you need an attorney.
can't think about that right now.
I need to find someone who was with a minister who liked to wear women's underwear.
victoria isn't the only one with a secret.
how do you even know this minister was with anyone?
Someonekilled him...
in a seedy motel room.
his wife - his wife knows exactly who he was with, and she won't tell me.
she's more worried we'll find out her husband was a transvestite than she is about finding his killer.
people are weird.
she even had her parents scrub down the crime scene with bleach.
I mean, who does that?!
Oh, my gosh!
they weren't just trying to wipe away fingerprints.
they were trying to wash away the sin.
that's it, isn't it?
they were shamed.
just wait till I ask the widow wycoff to help me find the person who was wearing that shoe.
thought you already knew it was the pastor's.
Yeah, but she doesn't know I know that!
watching me hunt for whose foot fits the ruby-red slipper might just make her realize she's not in kansas anymore.
I love these heart-to-hearts we have in the morning.
me too, honey. Me too.
when I stepped down from the pulpit of this church and passed it on to my son-in-law,
I never imagined the pain of a day like today.
God uses suffering to test us.
even in a death from despair, god offers us choices, asking if our faith is stronger than one leader, questioning whether this church is about one man or one god.
so, when you all are reaching out to our congregation, resist the temptation to sow gossip...
you have no right interrupting a confidential meeting of our stewardship committee.
I've thought of another way to find out who was with your husband when he died.
does this look familiar? - What are you doing? Put that away.
this shoe probably belongs to the woman with whom he was sleeping.
chances are, she either witnessed or caused his death.
my husband committed suicide.
pastor wycoff's death is undetermined, and while it remains that way,
I intend to try this shoe on every female in your congregation, ages 18 to 65, starting with the people on your stewardship committee.
you wouldn't dare.
No! Please, please.
mom, What's she saying?
please do not go into this church terrorizing everybody.
what makes you think I could possibly know who this woman was?
you destroyed all the computers your husband used here at the church, which gives us the idea he either met a woman online or was maintaining some sort of relationship with a woman online.
all right. Please put that away.
Yes. My husband went on the internet.
he went on a site where he found some woman named sindy showers, spelled s-i-n-d-y.
thank you. We'll check that out and get back to you.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
chief johnson... Do you even believe in god?
tell you what I do believe, mrs. Wycoff.
thou shalt not kill.
ma'am, that shoe won't fit anybody at this church.
how do you know that?
when my mom found my dad, she called me, and...
when I got to the motel, he was wearing that.
and he was dressed in women's underwear and a bra, and I helped her change him into a suit.
how do you explain the ligature marks on his neck.
come on, chris.
we're only trying to do right by your dad.
you've heard of the...
autoerotic thing people do?
Yeah, choking yourself while you're...
Yeah. - Your father did that?
my dad was on the floor with his belt around his throat.
and my mom rolled him over, and his hand was, uh...
can you really blame her for not wanting to talk about it?
chief, I just got off the phone with Dr. Morales.
he says the autoerotic asphyxiation thing is possible, but he wanted to know if we'd found a release mechanism at the motel.
not sure exactly what that is.
we didn't find one.
wait - What didn't we find?
typically, chief, the autoerotic guy rigs up the choking device with a quick release to prevent accidental hanging.
and wycoff only had his belt.
not sure how that explains the sprained ankle.
well, it's an awful lot to be doing in heels.
sindy showers is in interview room number 1.
vice tracked her down to a website called "who's your mommy?
she doesn't want a lawyer if we promise not to arrest her for solicitation and lewd conduct.
thank you, commander.
David, here's how to end this whole subpoena nightmare.
just call goldman and tell him you want to talk.
wouldn't that make me lookbad?
how could you look any worse?
ms. Showers, I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.
I just got a few questions for you regarding your safety.
my safety? - yes.
we're trying to find someone who might be targeting...
workers like yourself.
then okay, I guess.
do you recognize this man?
you're not serious.
if you're worried about my safety, you've got the wrong guy.
I've known him for years, see him once every month or so.
yesterday, as a matter of fact.
did you know he's a member of the clergy?
no. But that explains a few things. - Like?
like every time we finish, he tries to talk me out of ever meeting him again, and he always wants us to pray for forgiveness.
I'm used to getting on my knees, but not for that.
any other, um, unusual requests?
you mean the lingerie?
not that unusual.
I mean, you wouldn't believe what some men try to pull.
this one guy, he takes about 30 toasted almonds and lines them up
off topic. Off topic.
okay, look, cliffy pays me $300 for the hour, plus another $100 for the underwear and another $100 for the shoes.
so cliffy likes to wear women's clothes.
you know what?
so do i.
big deal.
he's not dangerous. I - I've always felt safe with him.
even when he asks you to cut off his air supply?
when he what?
have you ever heard of autoerotic
good god, no. Not on my menu.
no blood, no bruises, no bondage.
I'm telling you, whatever this is, you got the wrong guy.
he likes to play dress-up.
it makes him happy.
was he happy when you left him yesterday?
why wouldn't he be?
because, sindy, we found cliff in that motel room not long after you left, and he was dead.
what? no
are you serious?
now - Now you're scaring me.
that's... Awful. Dead how?
we're not sure exactly.
he may have committed suicide.
he didn't kill himself.
I can promise you that.
cliff loved his family way too much to leave them behind.
you knew he was married?
well, yeah.
cliff told me that his wife wasn't into his whole dress-up thing at all.
so she let him handle it by hiring me.
so she knew all along?
Yeah.
cliff said - I- I think her name is kate - That kate thought it was a little twisted, but as long as he didn't bring his bras and panties into the house, she could ignore it.
he - he might have been a little different from my usual dates, but he didn't deserve to die in that motel room.
his wife hired a prostitute for her cross-dressing husband.
and not just once or twice.
which means she also probably knew - When it was his time of the month?
uh, look, chief.
if she was aware of what was going on for a while, then why was yesterday the breaking point?
and why would he call her in despair?
good question.
but it shows up on the motel phone records. Pastor wycoff called his wife.
or did he?
chief? - yes.
chief? What are we gonna say in those depositions?
just the truth, I guess.
the truth. Yeah. But first, shouldn't we all agree as to what that is?
I do phone trees all the time, but very seldom do we get to put together an all-out matrix.
and this is every phone call between every family member?
land lines and cells.
everybody's calling everybody except the oldest son.
isn't it funny how, in every family, there's always an odd man out?
what is that supposed to mean?
it means everybody knows that you've already said your piece to goldman, and that's why he was here.
wait, wait. Who's "everybody" - Provenza, tao, and buzz - Or is "everybody" just you?
Oh, yeah, it's just me. I'm the only one that - Gentlemen, please stop this bickering!
this ridiculous lawsuit has nothing to do with you.
it's all about me.
detective sanchez, detective gabriel, lieutenant flynn,
I want a pair of shiny handcuffs slapped on Mrs. Wycoff.
make sure her family knows so that they'll follow her down here.
lieutenant provenza, lieutenant tao, let's get this murder board out of here.
where to, chief?
interview room 2. I don't want the wycoffs seeing it before we're ready.
how long have you known your husband was a cross-dresser?
just...A few weeks.
Really? Because sindy with an "s" told us that he dressed up for her once a month and that it was all your idea.
this is an attempt to destroy my church.
have a seat, sir.
you presume, because I'm a christian, that I somehow claim to be - No, no, no.
I presume that you're not proud of helping your husband commit adultery.
judge not lest ye be judged. - I won't be the one doing the judging, Mrs. Wycoff.
there is more to marriage than fidelity.
it's about raising children. It's about...
um... I did my best. I did my best. I really did my best.
I'm sure you did, but we need to talk about sindy.
she said your husband was happy when she left the motel room at 10: 55, so why did he want to die at 11: 02?
cliff was disgusted with himself.
he would come home from these terrible sessions and cry for forgiveness.
he hung himself.
why is that so hard for you to understand?
because if he was so ashamed, why did he kill himself dressed like that for all whole world to see?
Mrs. Wycoff, the coroner says your husband's wounds are consistent with murder by strangulation.
and we know that sindy - I told you, he called me from the motel.
but he didn't.
you keep lying to me, and I'm going to have to tell the media that your husband died wearing pink panties, a bra, and a new pair of pumps.
so, who called you from the motel?
if I tell you what happened, can you keep the prostitution and cross-dressing to yourselves?
we can try.
and will you leave my family out of it?
because, honestly, this is all about me.
all about you?
I called my own phone to establish an alibi.
I killed him. I snapped.
God forgive me. I killed him.
what are you doing? What is this?
your daughter just confessed, sir.
but you don't believe her!
I certainly do.
Oh, it's impossible.
Kate didn't kill him.
let me tell you what happened.
daddy, be quiet. - You can't arrest her.
actually, I intend to arrest your entire family - The whole lying lot of you
as accessories to murder after the fact.
so, now would be a good time to stop covering up for each other.
detective sanchez, read them their rights, please, starting with george here.
what are you doing? This is crazy.
you have the right to remain silent, sir. - What did we do?
besides obstruct justice and destroy evidence?
let me show you.
this is a, uh, matrix - Or a map, if you will
of all the phone calls made around the time of your father's death.
um, Here is your mother calling from the motel to her own cellphone to make it look like she wasn't there - very clever.
about 45 minutes later, she called your grandparents, who, in turn, called your little sister and brother to pick up your father's clothes from home, I assume.
and here's the call informing you that your father had
wait a minute.
lieutenant tao, this is chris wycoff over here, and yet looks like no one called him.
could that be right?
Yes, chief. - And yet you were at the motel.
how'd you even know your father was dead? Skywriting?
I was pulling duty on base when I got the call.
no, you weren't.
we checked with your commander.
you asked for yesterday off two weeks ago.
which makes this look a lot like premeditation.
wait.
I'll tell you why I didn't get the call.
ma'am, can we talk privately?
lieutenant.
a couple weeks ago, my dad asked me to look at his computer at church.
he was having trouble with the wi-fi.
and I found a hidden e-mail account where this woman - This prostitute - Was writing to him about their next meeting.
I had trouble believing it, so I followed him.
I wanted to confront him.
so, you watched him check into the motel, and you saw the prostitute come and go?
exactly, and after she left, I opened the door, and my dad was lying dead on the floor from the autoerotic
no, no, no, no, no. There was no autoerotic anything.
well, it sure as heck looked like it.
I don't know. M - maybe the prostitute killed him.
I d - I don't know.
he was paying her $500 an hour.
why would she kill him?
look, your mother just confessed to this murder.
I could take her word for it, corporal.
is that what you want?
let your brother and sister grow up without both parents?
maybe they'd be better off.
your father led a double life, but your mom's the one who made it possible.
lying. Covering up for him.
maybe she deserves to go to prison. hmm?
is that what you're thinking?
in our house, we were taught,"honor thy father and thy mother.
if you so much as breathed wrong, you got the belt.
did you ever breathe wrong?
when I was 15, my - my dad, the man who taught me right from wrong, the guy who liked to wear women's lingerie...
he found a note from this boy that I knew in choir
Jeff. The two of us were, uh...
Jeff and I were close.
we were close.
and I saved that note in my room at the very back of my desk drawer.
it was none of my dad's business...
that note.
but he found it.
and he went crazy.
went crazy how?
first he beat me.
the he shipped me off to military school.
and when I came home for christmas,
I - I found out that my dad had brought that note over to jeff's house and showed it to his parents and that...
my friend...
he'd killed himself.
Oh, and guess who preached at jeff's funeral.
so when my dad opened that door yesterday, looking like some kind of freak...
and he started saying that it was only this once and that
that we should just pray about it, and at least he wasn't gay.
you saw his belt.
is that it?
you grabbed his belt?
Yeah, I grabbed his belt.
and what did you do?
it's time to do the honorable thing, corporal.
I put it around his neck, and I yanked him all over the room.
and then?
ma'am, I spent five years in afghanistan.
I know when someone's dead.
I killed him. And then I called my mother.
and I left him in his little outfit, thinking,"well...
now she'll finally see the truth.
but she already knew.
and I realized, while she was fussing with him, you know, taking off his bra, asking me to help knot his tie, that she had never once in all of my life stood up for anyone but him.
and for a moment there - For a really bad moment
I thought about killing her, too.
ma'am...
I'm sorry to have lied to you about everything.
it was not the honorable thing to do, and I wish to apologize for having caused everyone so much trouble.
well...
I don't deal much in forgiveness, corporal.
but I sure am sorry to have to arrest you for murder in the first degree.
Hey, everyone.
good to see you again.
I have to congratulate you guys on being a pretty tight little unit.
detective david gabriel...
you have been served.
happy now?
it's what you asked for.
ecstatic. Thank you.
now you know what it's like to be singled out by your own gang.
but seriously, don't thank me.
thank chief johnson.
she's the one who put you all in the spotlight.
asked to be subpoenaed?
it's only fair, right? So, come on. Give it up.
show me some love. I'm subpoenaed, too.
welcome to the club. no rats.
no rats here. - No rats.
Oh, thank you, lieutenant. I could have told you that, though.
you're home early.
rough day?
sort of.
Baylors' attorney came back and subpoenaed detective gabriel, so that officially puts my entire division in hot water.
over a decision made by me and me alone.
what I'm wondering about now is, how much worse are things going to get?
I mean... Really, how much worse?
a little worse, maybe.
what? You too? Why?
remember when turell first presented himself, I volunteered to provide protective custody for his mom and sister.
I'm - I'm so sorry.- why?
look, what did you do, really...
except your job?
I - I drove turell home, and I dropped him off.
and that's it.
that's it. That's all.
I mean, there was no decision at all, really.
I don't know why we're being treated like this.
Oh, shoot, now look what I've done.
it's okay. I got it. Just a spill, hon.
what have I done?
there's no permanent damage.
I'll wipe it up.
okay. It's okay.
you say that your responsibility ended the moment turell left your custody, but in a civil trial, the jury may very well decide that you behaved with a callous disregard to the suspect's life.
and if the city attorney starts to think that he is losing this case - He could settle. - And you will be entirely on your own.
so what should I do?
for your own sake, get your own attorney!
And...Two waters coming up.
thank you, Mr. Baker. - Call me Gavin, please.
I'm sorry about those labels.
I tell our managing partner it's vulgar, but all the other big law firms are doing it, and apparently we're all lemmings.
so, let's review this civil suit, okay?
okay. - Okay.
plaintiff's attorney, mr. Goldman, states that while you had a black gang member, turell baylor, in police custody, he was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony about a double homicide.
the d. a.made that grant of immunity, not me.
I understand. Someone else creates the problem, police get sued. It's why I'm here.
goldman goes on to suggest that, "finding you could neither arrest nor detain Turell Baylor, you dropped him off at his own residence In front of several young men from his gang, knowing they intended to kill him."
Mr. Baylor was later found beaten to death by a person or persons unknown.
sounds exciting.
it's not, really.
Mr. Goldman finishes with, "Chief Johnson knowingly circumvented the criminal justice system by appointing herself judge, jury, and executioner." And...
thoughts?
do you think the baylor family could actually win this case?
it depends.
as a former city attorney, I can tell you that l will often avoid court costs by settling cases more ridiculous than this one.
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
tell me something, chief johnson. What do you think happened to Mr. Baylor?
I have no idea. Ididn't kill him.
you ever heard of murder by proxy?
Gavin, I had nothing to do with turell baylor's death.
well, that's good news, isn't it?
okay. So, why don't you just give me your 45-second version of events?
it's all in here.
I'm sorry. I must have been vague.
allow me to rephrase.
tell me, from your point of view, what happened to Mr. Baylor.
sorry.
may I get this? - No, go right ahead. It's your money.
what? M-money. My money? What do you mean?
sitting on that sofa costs you $10 a minute.
be my guest. I'll make myself an espresso.
when Sharon Raydor recommended you, she said you weren't gonna charge us for the first hour.
which I spent studying the baylor family filings and all the associated motions.
you're on the clock now.
but if you don't want to cooperate with me,
I suggest you stick with your city attorney and save yourself my $25, 000 retainer.
$25, 000?!
Gavin q. Baker. The "q" stands for "quick.
I should have known that captain raydor was gonna send me to the most expensive lawyer on earth!
litigation costs money.
we can't afford to pay it. - We can't afford not to.
well, what about a house and our retirement?
we're not even looking for a house. Come back. - Look, I have a murder - We'll just sit down with the guy and just talk to him. - oh, my god. I have a murder.
look, you talk to him. Well, listen. Just calm down. - Look, I have to go. I can't I can't - Look, I'll take the bottle from you - No. No.
for $10 a minute, I'm keeping the water.
hold it!
somebody must have locked the gate or...
I can't find my tennis shoes. Are they in your car?
I don't think so. You want me to go look? - No. No.
I wasn't planning on anyone dying in the himalayas today, but let's just get to it.
okay.
the owners of this house, Ron and Debbie King, they're putting in a new retaing wall.
about two hours ago, 911 got a call from a city building inspector who had come to check it out.
that's him over there in the orange vest.
nice dress, by the way. - Really?
does it make me look like the queen of england?
because that's how much money you need to be a police officer these days.
so, what? The contractor dug up a body? Is that it?
well, it's more like here-dugup a body.
let's just keep moving around the side here.
honestly, these stairs. When I find out who took my tennis shoes...
perhaps you misplaced them. - no. Somebody took them.
okay. Somebody took them.
so, this was the new wall here.
why'd they tear it down?
you okay, chief?
I'm fine! - Be careful. Watch your step.
okay. Tell her, Mike.
the contractor never pulled a permit in the first place.
so, when the city inspector came to check out the footings, it had to be torn down.
found something not up to code, chief.
two trash bags slapped together with duct tape.
Yeah, duct tape.
that's just never a good sign.
okay. It's a guy.
pretty good shape, except his head's beaten in.
not finding a wallet or an i. d.
name's probably doug underhill.
or phil upland.
guys - Okay. Turning off the camera.
are you sure, Buzz?
you don't want to miss all that great victim humor.
families of the deceased just love victim humor. Juries, too.
maybe we could get another lawsuit going.
or maybe we could just do our jobs!
okay.
well... In order to dump a body here last week, you would need to know that the contractor was digging a hole in the backyard, which would mean our primary suspects would probably be the owners of the house, Mr. And Mrs. King.
then you have the contractor, his crew, and a couple of the neighbors, I guess.
maybe they have a connection to the victim.
let's roll his prints, find out who he was.
fingerprints?
what makes you think he has a record, chief?
well, someone bashed his head in and buried him underneath a retaining wall.
I'm guessing he wasn't the most popular person on earth.
or maybe he was a lawyer.
detective sanchez, let's find that contractor, please.
chief johnson, meet the incredibly uncooperative Mr. David romano.
I can still get my wall inspected if you move those bags out of the way. What's taking so long?
dead bodies buried in your little home-improvement project.
tell me, Mr. Romano, did you skip the permit process on that retaing wall because you had someone in mind you wanted to bury?
look, honey, I haven't been waiting here for hours to answer stupid questions like that.
now, I'm behind schedule, and if you're not gonna help me, i'm leaving!
Mr. Romano, I need to talk to you.
Mr. Romano! You cannot just walk away from me!
well, I never!
sir! I said I want to talk to you!
Mr. Ro...Mr. Romano, drop those keys, or I'm going to arrest you!
arrest me for what?
we'll start with...
felony rudeness and work our way out from there!
maybe add illegal burial and interfering with a police officer.
don't you need a warrant to search there?
not for what's in plain sight.
plus your truck is illegally parked, sir.
and this is enough to hold you for the next 48 hours.
what would that do to your schedule, huh?
how is business, by the way? Any clients gone missing?
maybe I should dig up some more of your stuff, see what else I can find.
here's my work folder. Call everyone. I got nothing to hide.
and all contractors carry duct tape. So big deal.
Yeah, what about your workers? You hired anybody new lately?
you obviously don't know what's going on in the building trade right now.
I don't have enough jobs for my regular crew, much less strangers.
well, if things are so slow, why didn't you bother to get a permit?
listen, sweetie. The city has laid off so many inspectors, it takes a month to get one out here.
unless there's a complaint.
I'm citing you for violation 106 of the l. a.City building code.
your job here is red-tagged until you file a permit.
don't let him go anywhere.
AFIS identified our victim as a Mr. John david dale, and I think we're going to have a lot more suspects.
more?! We already have too many suspects as it is. Why more?
well, Mr. Dale was a registered sex offender.
lived in that house right up there with the red awning.
a sex offender?
sure you don't want to just cover him up and call it a day?
what was he registered for?
rape of a minor.
all right, lieutenants Flynn and Provenza, would you please escort our victim to the morgue?
detective Gabriel, please ask hollywood division to help round up some of Mr. Dale's neighbors.
find out just how popular he was.
detective Sanchez, please invite the King family downtown for a visit.
and make sure that they bring their little girl.
lieutenant tao, let's get search warrants, go over every square inch of this property and the victim's house, too.
what should I say we're looking for?
well, the victim was bashed in the head, so I'd say blood And plenty of it.
thank you.
it had to be murder because you can't inflict this kind of damage on the back of your own head.
even harder to tape yourself in a trash bag after you're dead.
how long since he shuffled off to buffalo?
I'm not sure. He's remarkably well preserved. Where did you find him?
under a retaing wall. - And when was the wall put up?
a week ago last tuesday.
so today's a Friday, which means Mr. Dale has been dead for...
I'd say, 12 days. - Very scientific.
like I said, unlike the two of you, he's well-preserved.
and a good thing, too, because his body provides a pretty clear map of the attack.
these three circular wounds. -Is that a hammer blow of some kind?
a ball peen hammer, yes.
this one up top Pretty light, didn't hurt him too badly.
this one a little heavier blow. Still no fracture.
and the last one knocked him down. But these wounds are fairly superficial.
the hammer didn't kill him. - Then what did?
sharp force trauma at the base of the skull.
I never saw a wound like that before.
lots of weight behind it.
I - I should do a cast of it for you.
now, all I can tell you about the murder weapon is that it's conical in shape.
pointy at the top and widening out toward the base.
sounds exactly like my second wife.
all right, let's review.
the guy's hit three times with a ball peen hammer.
then falls flat on his face.
and there are abrasions on his palms and knees.
and then he tries to crawl away, over a rough surface. And then...
someone shoved a cone in his head?
what kind of cone? - don't know, chief.
Provenza's waiting for the cast of the wound to be finished.
but the doctor said that Mr. Dale bled out, so you're right. Somewhere there's a big mess.
but we didn't find any blood in the hole, the yard, the patio, or in either the kings' house or the victim's.
and whoever bagged Mr. Dale used gloves, so there's no prints on the duct tape.
well, I checked with the victim，sorry.
I checked with the victim of Mr. Dale's sexual assault. It turns out she was his cousin.
and as far as the sexual assault goes, she said their family just stopped talking to him and let it go.
well, that explains why he was dead for 12 days and no one reported him missing.
a conical weapon.
maybe it's a tool from the construction site?
lieutenant tao, did you find a funnel or anything like it?
no. Well... I did see some party hats.
you know, and if you turned them upside down, they would have the proper shape.
but, of course, they were made out of cardboard...
chief? I'm not sure you have enough suspects on your board.
not only was Mr. Dale a registered sex offender, hollywood division says the local schools put his picture up on their public notice boards.
plus... The house next door to where you found him has an excellent view of the kings' backyard.
and it's for sale.
meet the owners.
chief Johnson, Greg and Malin Turner.
Greg, malin, thank you so much for helping us out today.
commander taylor tells me y'all are moving away.
when we can sell our house.
it's been on the market for over six months.
I have a sweet job offer in chicago. Advertising company.
but we're not moving to chicago if we can't sell our home.
and, chief, that's the real story. You see, Greg and Malin have been having open houses.
open houses? You mean, where potential buyers walk through your house and your backyard?
our realtor suggested them.
and, like, not counting neighbors, we've had maybe 200 potential customers stop by.
buyers, Greg. Buyers. We're looking for buyers, not customers.
200? - Only need one.
not counting neighbors, all of whom could have seen the construction.
and the hole being dug for the retaing wall, so we can now expand our list of suspects to include google earth.
sorry. We're just riffing.
I don't suppose either one of you noticed anything unusual going on in the kings' backyard recently?
no. - Not really.
well, but their contractor pulled out all the wiring, so you can't see over there at night anymore.
it's, like, dark.
and were you familiar at all with the victim?
you mean joe blow?
sorry. That's just what everyone called him.
could be we weren't, you know, as nervous about the guy 'cause...
we don't have kids. And also what we heard about john was, like, gossip.
we don't even know what he was supposed to have done.
12 years ago, when he was 19, Mr. Dale raped a 14-year-old girl.
not good.
maybe that's why the kings never let their daughter play outside by herself.
you know, Debbie had to run to the airport a couple of times, and she asked me to watch Kayla for her.
and she was really, really paranoid about not letting kayla go in their backyard without an adult.
paranoid in what way?
how would you like your kids playing in front of a child rapist?
that monster should have never been allowed in our neighborhood.
how are you so well-acquainted with Mr. Dale's criminal record?
the megan's law website.
you type in your address, and a big blue dot shows up where sex offenders live.
I shouldn't have to explain how that works to the police.
and you found out Mr. Dale was living behind you when?
about a year-and-a-half ago. He moved in after his mother died.
I don't know what she was thinking, leaving him that house.
did you ever confront Mr. Dale or argue with him about your this is enough! We get read our rights and then hauled down to the police station like criminals.
with our child! Kayla shouldn't even be here. - This is ridiculous!
your daughter is being supervised by specialists in our child-care center. So don't worry about her.
did Mr. Dale ever approach kayla or try to talk to her?
no.
and as much as I hate the idea that completely innocent people like my wife and I might need a lawyer, I'm close to calling one.
well, get your wallet out, sir, because that's areally expensive alternative to just cooperating with us.
Mr. Dale was the criminal. Not us!
and if you'd been found buried in his backyard, I'd already have him under arrest.
but that's not what happened. - Let me make this clear to you.
we never spoke to the guy. Our daughter never spoke to the guy.
we never set foot on his property. And he sure as hell never came on ours.
and he never, ever touched kayla, because if he had
if he had even laid one finger on my little girl - Ron. That's enough! - No, no, no.
that's enough! - You wouldn't have to dig him up, because I would have beat him to death myself and dropped him off in front of the police station for you!
sit down, Mr. King.
now I'm invoking my right to counsel.
well, better make yourselves comfortable.
because if you even try to leave, I will be arresting you for the illegal disposal of human remains.
wait! What about kayla?!
we don't leave children alone with suspected felons, mrs. King.
I demand to see kayla. - We can't let her do that!
I demand to see our daughter!
please, where is kayla? She won't know what's going on!
that's what i'm supposed to do if he ever comes into our backyard. But...
if he stops to talk to me in his blue car, I have this.
and then I'm supposed to run.
did you take mr. Dale away?
or is he gonna stay under the wall?
what would you like us to do?
can I think about it? - Sure.
look My office is really not a good place to bring children while you're interviewing their parents.
what are you doing right now that's so important anyway?
well, believe it or not, losing weight is not just about eating boring, terrible food.
it's also about exercise. This is the time that I try to set aside to ride my bike.
I mostly exercise at home.
can you just hurry, please?
I can't ever have anyone over to the house 'cause all my friends know about him.
so I guess you should take Mr. Dale away.
does not having your friends over bother you?
no. I get bothered 'cause my mom gets so upset.
she told Mr. Dale she'd kill him if he ever came back to our house.
Mr. Dale came over to your house? When?
you can trust her. She's police, like me.
I saw him in our backyard. Daddy fought with him.
fought with him how?
well, Mr. Dale was shouting at Mr. Romano for being so loud, and that's when mom and dad ran out and told Mr. Dale if he ever came back, they would kill him.
and did you ever see him again after that?
no. Not until mr. Romano dug him up.
how did you even know he was there?
that, kayla, is an excellent question.
so, you're making dinner, huh?
I am.
friday night. Just thought maybe we'd go out...
no, no, no, no. We need to save money to pay for this attorney. So no more restaurants, no more take-out, either.
well, that's a great idea.
six years after the trial's over, you'll finally have enough money to hire your lawyer.
sooner than that.
I made some other changes today.
just so you know, there's a limit to how many nights a week I can eat clam linguini.
wait. What other changes?
I stopped the newspaper.
you stopped the newspaper?
it's just that much more to clean up. And you never read it.
like you ever clean it up. I read the paper!
I also use it to keep track of all the baseball scores across the entire country. You can't just to activate telephone service at this location...
you know what's wrong with the phone?
I canceled the landline. - You what?!
look, fritzi, you need to be more reasonable about this. We both have cellphones.
it's crazy, all this money we're spending on luxury items - when we haven't even bought a house. - Luxury items?
you haven't wanted to look at a house in three years.
all our credit cards are attached to this number.
what about my sponsor? What about my friends from a. a?
I got an idea, honey. They can all call me on my confidential fbi cellphone.
you know, you make all these changes, you don't tell me about it.
not only is it disrespectful, but you're not gonna...
honey, what channel are you looking for?
channel Unavailable - You turned off the cable. - No! I didn't turn off the cable.
I just canceled all those extra channels we never watch.
that you don't watch! You don't watch them! You don't read the paper.
you never answer the landline. - I'm sorry. Hold on for just one second.
I'm on the phone with work. - You don't care what we eat as long as you have a chocolate bar at the bottom of your plate.
that is a terrible thing to say! Terrible!
and this phone call is about a sex offender who was murdered, bagged, and buried in the hollywood hills A little more important than what's on tv.
Yes, detective Sanchez. I'm sorry.
what did you find out about the contractor?
he was telling the truth, chief. He never applied for a permit to build anything at the king place.
this is ridiculous.
hang on. What? What is ridiculous?
we can hire the attorney without starving ourselves, isolated from the modern world.
I am not spending the money.
well, then you'd better get it from the city, because I am not living like this.
you know, as a matter of fact, why don't you go talk to your buddy pope about it?
chief?
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm I'm here.
look, if the contractor never pulled a permit for the retaing wall, then how did the inspector know to come by and have it dug up?
Mr. Romano said something about a complaint, didn't he?
no...no, no!
chief? Are you okay?
I'm fine.
you want us to find the city inspector for you?
Yes, please.
what's his name again?
chief johnson, meet our hero from yesterday.
Mr. Raymond aguirre, city building inspector.
Mr. Aguirre, thank you so much for taking time to see us today.
well, I'm glad to help the police.
though I have to wonder why I was given my rights in the elevator.
that's just a new city policy.
Yeah, we have to mirandize everyone who comes in the building nowadays.
don't let it make you feel too special.
just want to let you know I've never taken a bribe, ever.
that's... Good.
detective Gabriel, would you please escort Mr. Aguirre to our......Visitor's conference center?
I'll be with y'all in just one moment. Thank you so much.
so, after the kings made bail last night, why did you order surveillance on their house?
they're suspects in a murder, will, and they invoked their right to counsel.
not everybody who asks for an attorney is guilty.
Yeah, tell me about it.
you and captain raydor keep saying I need to get my own lawyer, but no one's offered to help me pay for it.
look, will...Can't you talk to the union and see if they
no, you're management. The union can't help you.
well, what about the city? Can't they do something?
Yeah. Like that'll happen.
I shouldn't have to surrender my life's savings to defend myself when I am completely, 100% innocent.
all right. I'll ask the mayor if he can find the money to help you out.
and in the meantime, if I'm gonna be paying s. i.s. overtime to sit on the Kings' house all weekend, I'd like to see some kind of compelling evidence that connects them to this case.
besides lying about the fight that they had with Mr. Dale and finding him buried in their backyard?
Yes. Besides that. - Well, how about this, then?
the victim was 6 feet tall, over 200 pounds.
how do you think his body made it up those stairs in the middle of the night?
that's not evidence. That's logistics.
look, I will ask the mayor to help you, and in exchange for that, you will either re-arrest the kings by 6: 00 p. m.Or end the surveillance.
I don't have enough time to do my job properly anymore.
the city cut back on the department.
and we lost some of our people when they were arrested for taking bribes, which I have never done in my life ever!
anyway, there aren't enough inspectors left to issue approvals, let alone go hunting for some illegal building.
so, Mr. Romano, the kings' contractor, took advantage of that to start the work without your knowledge.
Yes. Absolutely. Completely without my knowledge.
wait a minute. Mr. Romano never even applied for a permit?
no. And it's very short-sighted for the owner to let a contractor start building that way.
and now if the kings ever want to sell their home, the disclosure laws in california will require them to tell potential buyers that they built without permits.
disclosure laws.
okay, so, just so I understand, you're saying that no one in your office ever knew that Mr. Romano built the wall in the kings' backyard.
look, can you cut me a break?
we don't have the means to check up on building like this.
then how did you know to inspect it?
excuse me?
you had no paperwork on this site. You never visited it.
yet a few days after a man was buried there, you just happen to turn up at the kings' house and demand that the wall covering up his body be torn down?
I didn't just happen to show up. And I wasn't bribed, either. I was responding to a complaint.
from whom?
I'm not supposed to...
give that information out to anyone at any time for any reason.
I'll never tell. - Okay.
there are two ways you can contact us.
one is with the tip line, and the other is by sending an e-mail, like this one.
to whom it may concern, "My neighbors are building a retaing wall, and not only does their contractor start work too early
which is a very common complaint we get it all the time "he doesn't have a permit posted in the front yard.
I don't know why people even care about that I wouldn't.
could you check on this for me? Sincerely, John David dale.
and that was dated four days ago.
well, that is extremely unusual.
why is that?
because when he wrote this, mr. Dale was buried beneath the retaing wall he was complaining about.
thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
not a problem.
not a problem.
I have a closing statement to write for this week, and I work most saturdays anyway.
water? - No. Thanks.
still have a bottle from yesterday.
good. Good, good, good.
what's up?
what's up? Well...
Just...Dive right in.
okay.
I need a huge favor.
look, I want to pay your retainer, from money inherited from my parents, but I want my wife...
to think it came from the city.
I see.
well... I sympathize with you. I do.
but I like to be completely honest with my clients.
well, she's never gonna be completely honest withyou.
Yes, but there's a difference between my lying to her and her lying to me.
hold on. Hold on. Look, nobody's asking you to lie.
well, then, maybe I'm confused. What exactly is it you want me to do?
you're supposed to be a very good lawyer, which means you should be able to clearly and simply explain things to my wife in a way she completely misunderstands.
that's her.
Look...If you do decide to take Brenda's case, It'd be great if you swung by her office and talked to her about it in person.
preferably tonight, because I would like to watch some television when I get home.
honey. What is it?
the parking lot at the grocery store. Where are you?
an open house?
where?
you're, uh, not at work today?
Pope gave most of my division the rest of the day off. Overtime issues. So I thought we'd look at houses.
Really? Buying a house That will help us cut back enough to hire the attorney?
well, I spoke to Pope about that, like you suggested, and he said he's going to look into it.
but still, honey, this looks like a little more house than we can afford.
I don't know about that.
it's a buyer's market. It's only $2. 5 million. - Only $2. 5 million.
I met the owners today, and they're desperate to sell.
there.
Conner ellis. I'll be showing the house today.
you guys looking for a new place to live?
we are. I'm brenda, and this is fritz. We're both doctors, so we're pre-approved for loans.
do you mind if we start in the backyard? In my free time, I just live to be outside.
and fritzi here is a griller.
a griller? I'm... I'm a griller...From way back.
so if the backyard isn't right, then we might as well not even look at the rest of the house May we?
sure. Come this way...Doctor.
it's a beautiful day to look at some of the outdoor features.
and the owners keep everything super nice.
gardeners come twice a week. Pool is perfectly maintained.
do you mind if we head out on our own, just to get the feel of the place?
sure.
my goodness. It is so romantic!
if you think so, darling.
excuse us, conner. - Certainly.
take your time.
so tell me, doctor, what are we looking for out here?
drag marks or...
wheelbarrow tracks.
hon? Look what I see.
right next door. The ruins of a retaining wall under which someone like a murder victim could be buried.
don't you need a warrant to go poking around like this?
it says "open house."
open.
look. Isn't it beautiful, honey? Let's take some pictures!
Oh my...
don't hurt yourself. I got it. I got it.
you're not gonna tell me you're into garden gnomes, are you?
no, but I would like to meet the little fella who used to live here.
why are you interested in a missing gnome?
because he saw the murder, up close and personal.
what are you looking at?
the grout between the tiles.
what about it?
her father told her that if there are cracks in the grout, the house could be moving, you know, earthquakes.
no, no. We'd have to disclose that.
he's right, honey. California civil code requires property owners to fully and completely disclose any known problems with the house before selling them.
a building inspector talked to me about it today for about an hour.
it looks like this side's recently been cleaned with bleach, but I'm sure I can get what I need with the proper lighting.
anything else you'd like to disclose?
d - don't you want to see the rest of the house?
let's get the bad news over with first.
there was rain damage last year. It is all fixed.
and...The owners had termites four years ago, but they tented.
a Megan's law registrant lived behind us here. Died recently - parking across the street - Megan's law?
a sex offender lives close by?
lived. lived. Past tense. He died. Last week. Thank god.
that guy single-handedly kept me from selling this house for months.
anyway, uh, street parking is - Thank you, conner.
which way is the master bedroom, please?
it's one of my wife's little quirks.
first thing she needs to know is if there's enough room for her shoes.
shoes, uh, they're very important.
Yeah. Yep.
you finding everything you want in there?
I am.
in fact...I think I'm ready to make the owners an offer right now.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the state.
we can afford an attorney. - We just don't need one.
look, before y'all start interrupting me and saying things you're going to regret,
I wanted to show you, malin, all these spots here on your jeans and your sneakers
they're from the bleach that splashed up on your clothes while you were cleaning blood off your patio. And...
our lab sprayed the grout between the tiles on your terrace.
and it tested positive for blood residue.
in a few days, we'll have a dna match of our victim.
and that is enough to arrest you both for murder.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. - No.
wait a minute. Wait. Wait. - No, greg.
don't try to protect me anymore. - We have
I did it.
honey! No!
Greg no! - I have to tell her.
Malin's right, greg.
if you don't explain exactly what happened, we cannot help you.
I - I told greg when he came home. We should have called the police.
you were only defending yourself. She has nothing to explain.
let's put it behind us, honey.
they already know most of the story anyway.
look, John dale. He must have been watching us, waiting for times when I would be alone.
if only we had known he was, like, you know, a rapist!
Greg, be quiet.
I mean...Let me tell her what happened, please.
anyway, about two weeks ago, I went into our backyard...
and there he was John david dale...
waiting for me.
and he he tried...
he trI - he tried...
he tried to rape her.
and all malin did was, you know, try to stop him.
she didn't mean to kill him.
when I got home, malin was still really upset.
and I just wanted the dude off our property, so, you know, sorry about the illegal burial, but it was, like, very spur-of-the-moment.
Really? Because it seems a bit better organized than that.
we found this stuff at your house.
according to greg's credit card, he bought the wheelbarrow and everything in it the day before you claim mr. Dale tried to rape you.
the outdoor bleach...And, the trash bags...
box of 50, 2 missing.
are the same ones that Mr. Dale was stuffed in.
and the duct tape matches what was used to close the bags up. And the ball peen hammer...
which exactly fits several wounds on the victim's skull.
I don't know, y'all.
doesn't it seem a little coincidental that all of this should be happening right when your neighbor's yard was being dug up, giving you the perfect place to bury Mr. Dale?
you're, like, suggesting that we, like, murdered the guy.
why would we do that?
maybe because living so close to a registered sex offender made your home impossible to sell.
except for Mr. Dale's name couldn't be removed from the megan's law website until he was declared dead.
and for that, you need the body.
and you didn't have it.
so you sent a letter of complaint to the city building inspector in regards to the illegal retaing wall where you buried him.
they dug him up.
and that is our version of how Mr. Dale died.
so what do you think, greg?
are we on the right track?
no. - Well...
no, no, no. - Well...
he tried to rape me, I was alone, and I defended myself.
okay. Let's see if that's possible.
last week, you asked your gardeners, who come twice a week, to take away this perfectly good lawn ornament.
they were surprised, your gardeners, because you cleaned him up before throwing him out.
turns out, the wound in the base of our victim's skull goes exactly with the tippy-top of this little gnome's hat.
you know what it looks like, malin?
honestly, it looks like you struck Mr. Dale several times with that hammer, not realizing how heavy it was to swing.
especially for a little slip of a girl like you.
and when you realized that Mr. Dale fell down and only broke his nose, you grabbed the nearest object you could find, and shoved it into his head.
I was panicked...
and defenseless and alone.
okay. If you could show me how you picked up that little garden gnome all by yourself, then I'll take your word for it.
lift with your legs. Lift with your legs, babe.
if it makes you feel any better, I had to have my husband help me with it, too.
I can get it.
what I don't understand is why you went back into mr. Dale's house and wrote that e-mail when you could have just called and lodged a complaint.
we thought you might, like, recognize our voices.
I'll take that as your confession.
Greg, you idiot!
hold on. Wait. I just figured out what we should have said.
is there any way we could, you know, like, start our story over?
no... Because, like, you know, you're under arrest for murder in the first degree.
chief johnson. The lawyer is here.
they called a lawyer?
no, no.
your attorney is here.
okay.
well, we need to take care of our guests here first, but, uh, buzz, would you mind removing our little friend here?
gives me the creeps.
hello. - Hello.
to what do we owe the honor?
well, I just wanted to drop by and tell you how good it was to meet you yesterday, and how honored I am to be representing you in this Turell baylor business.
Bo, no. No, not yet.
look, you're a great attorney and all that, but we still haven't figured out how we're gonna pay your fee.
that's been taken care of.
the retainer.
and you, chief johnson, you, personally, will not be paying me a dime.
I won't? - As long as we don't go to trial.
but, as we say in my profession, "we'll double-cross that bridge when we come to it."
I'm sorry. Excuse me one little second.
sure.
I thought I said no more overtime.
well, thank yousomuch for getting the city to pay for my attorney.
you have no idea how much this means to me.
you really don't.
well, uh...Well, you're welcome.
thank you so much, Will. Really.
thank you with all my heart.
I'm just...I'm glad it got managed.
so... Good work.
good work.
flight risk.
all right, then.
thanks to chief pope, we are in business.
Yeah. All thanks to pope.
since I'm here, why don't we just, very quickly, establish some ground rules, okay?
okay. - Okay.
I think, as a general policy, fewer things will go wrong if we all agree, from this moment on, to be completely honest with each other.
how about this?
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me god.
so help me god.
thank you.
gave us a visitor's pass.
stop! Eyes left!
man, I hate being in here.
and without a gun, too.
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. This is Detective Gabriel.
it's about time you showed up.
Why? Did you have other plans for the evening?
Where's your attorney, Mr. Diamond?
Yeah, I'm pro per.
you're representing yourself?
which means I can spend all day in the law library if I want to, which is where everyone thinks I am right now.
come on, let's get this thing started!
that's an excellent idea.
what do you have to tell us?
okay, I got some information on a murder-for-hire, which I'm willing to give up in exchange for the D. A.dropping his third strike against me.
so, go get my deal, come on back...
tell you everything I know. - Are you crazy?
we just got here.
did you hear the clanging on the pipes when y'all walked in here?!
bing bang bingity-bang?
whole joint knows you're in the house.
what's gonna happen when they find out that I'm the person talking to you?
what happens to me then?
have you already been attacked by your fellow prisoners?
your face looks like a mess.
no, no, I got that when y'all arrested me.
that was the toughest bust I ever took.
that was a stupid car chase.
no, I'm safe for now.
you all better hurry, get the D. A. back here with a deal,'cause, believe me, it's worth it.
Mr. Diamond, this evening already ranks as one of the low points of my life.
I'm not coming back.
if you've got something to tell me and you want my help, go ahead, fascinate me.
maybe you can start with the victim in this murder-for-hire.
who was it?
not "Who was the victim?" Man."Who is.
I'm talking about stopping a murder from happening.
we're listening.
see, whenever I come back here, I'm a trustee, which means I get to move around a lot.
one day, I'm spooning chili in the mess hall.
next day, I'm mopping floors in high-power.
see, everybody knows me, or knows of me.
and I can get visitors, which means if you need to get word out to the street to someone,
I'm a go-to guy.
so, last night, I get a kite to pass on.
and because it's from this powerful cat, I take a look...
and I read the message...
ordering a hit on the outside.
and it all goes down tomorrow.
tomorrow.
okay, let me see this kite.
no, I had to let it fly, baby.
you knowingly passed on orders for a murder?
if I hadn't, I'd be dead myself already that's the hand to God!
okay, all right, who's the target?
a D. A. and a deal -- that's what I want -- on paper, legitimate.
Mr. Diamond, it's interesting you use the word "legitimate.
I've been studying your jacket, and you have been convicted of perjury twice
the last time, for providing false information about a homicide.
and here you are now -- having violated your parole and facing a third strike
and suddenly you've got a story about another murder?
I know. You want a show of good faith, right?
all right, I'm gonna give you something to whet your beak, but y'all better hurry, 'cause you only got till tomorrow.
the murder has something to do with...
case number BA120368.
look it up.
it's a case before the Superior Court -- California vs. a Robert Curtis.
he's the alleged banker for the Garcia drug cartel's American operations.
Mr. Curtis is facing so many counts of money laundering, he could go to jail for the rest of his life, or he could be cooperating with the D. A.
which would explain why the cartel would want him dead.
but this, uh -- this Diamond guy, who, by all accounts, is a pathological liar, is in jail, where this might all be common knowledge.
what makes you think he's not just looking for a likely target and trying to game the system again?
Mr. Diamond gave his case number from memory.
doesn't that at least warrant a follow-up?
we've been working through the night, trying to prevent a murder
all right, who's prosecuting this, uh, banker guy, uh, Mr. Curtis?
DDA Hobbs.
great. You know Hobbs. Call her. Give her the information.
between the D. A.'s office and the sheriff's department, they have plenty of resources to take over this investigation.
why would they take over the investigation?
because what happens in jail is the sheriff's problem, not ours.
but this case was brought directly to the L. A.P. D.
Yeah, by a snitch in the county jail, with information about a county case, looking to make a deal with the county prosecutor.
county, county, county.
chief, sir, with all due respect, Ray Diamond took a huge risk reaching out to us last night.
we promised him that we would follow up.
which you will do by telling DDA Hobbs all about it.
look, I'll share a secret with you.
the city and the L. A.P. D. are broke, out of money.
now, if this snitch had come to you in our jurisdiction, it would be different, but he didn't, so it's not.
he is physically and financially the problem of the district attorney of the county of Los Angeles, to whom Major Crimes will immediately hand off this investigation.
chief, we have updates on the Ray Diamond case.
as a trustee, Diamond has access to all parts of the jail, - including high -- including high-power, where at least six known associates of the Garcia cartel are housed.
high-power detainees don't get phone calls, and they don't get out-of-cell time, so they would use a guy like Diamond to get their messages out.
uh, Captain, Ray Diamond is a prisoner that we're holding in county.
here's his jacket. - Good.
the L. A.P. D. and the FBI have been investigating the Garcias for years.
they're like Dirtbag, Inc.
and it's not just drugs.
they traffic in people and guns, and they're really rich.
that's where the banker, Robert Curtis, comes into play.
according to this indictment, it was his responsibility to manage all the cartel's money.
Yeah, he probably set himself up a great pension plan.
you're not too far off, Lieutenant.
the Garcias do run the cartel like a major corporation, and they have themselves subpoenaed from all over the prison system to the L. A. county jail, where they have these board-of-directors meetings.
and it looks to us like your, uh, banker, Robert Curtis, had sole control over their American finances.
now, if he's looking to make a deal, we could use his testimony to help track and confiscate the cartel's money worldwide.
okay, so, we have a Garcia cartel board-of-directors meeting going on right now in L. A. county jail's high-power.
okay, so they must have heard that the banker's turning against them.
so they send out the order to kill him with a kite they pass through Ray Diamond.
Where's Mr. Curtis right now?
in an undisclosed location.
and his hearing isn't listed on the Trial Court Information System.
probably because it's sequestered for his own protection.
so he is making a deal.
well, Chief, your snitch is starting to look a little more credible.
what? What's the matter?
well, according to Chief Pope, this is the county's case.
he just wants us to hand over all our information to DDA Hobbs and let her just run the show.
captain Raydor? - Chief Johnson?
I have a complaint. - When have you not?
in our interview with Mr. Diamond, he said that, after leading the police on a car chase, he was beaten before he was arrested.
come on, Chief, Diamond probably dumped the car at some point and tried to run away.
when you tackle a suspect like that, there's bound to be
lieutenant Flynn, this bruise underneath his eye and the cut on his forehead indicate a possible categorical use of force by the L. A.P. D.
and, you know, Ray did say that this was his toughest bust ever.
I think that I should go to county jail and interview Mr. Diamond immediately.
and while you're taking his complaint, would you please let him know that I am in communication with DDA Hobbs?
great.
see if you can get him to confirm that this banker,
robert Curtis, really is the intended target.
also, if, while you're conducting your F. I.D. investigation,
Mr. Diamond has anything more to say about this kite, I'd love to hear it.
chief?
looks like Ray Diamond won't be filing a complaint after all.
we've secured the scene.
it's all yours. You guys can feel free to take over.
any questions? - No I think we're good.
sergeant...
sergeant Stanton, do you have any idea who murdered Ray Diamond?
this is high-power, ma'am.
got only about a dozen guys to choose from, and all of them love killing people.
such a secure wing.
how did they manage to stab him to death without a guard noticing?
all due respect, ma'am, the county owns this investigation.
we don't answer to you.
in fact, we have our own questions.
like why all this interest in Ray to begin with?
ray made allegations of police brutality during his arrest.
and I can help you out with that.
before he died, Ray said the cops didn't do it.
Really? Well, good luck.
especially considering the guy was stabbed in the throat half a dozen times.
Yeah, he had to repeat twice.
look... first you guys send down a Deputy Chief, and you follow up with a Captain?
this isn't about some brutality beef.
if there's something we need to know -- Tell me, sergeant, other than the L. A.P. D. did Ray Diamond have any visitors in the past 48 hours?
Hey, yourself. I came by this morning.
where were you?
I'm a busy man. What can I say?
what happened to your face? - This?
high-speed chases never end good, you know?
I've never been in one.
what are you looking at?
nothing. You're pretty.
well, it was good to see you.
Oh, so, that's it?
just do it? - Don't say nothing.
right on.
stop right there.
buzz, please play it back again slowly and blow it up if you can.
you really want to watch it again?
bigger and slower.
there's your kite.
EW. Ray Diamond passed it through a kiss.
who is that woman?
according to the visitors' log, her name is Maria Flores.
and under "relation," she put down "girlfriend.
girlfriend?
she's, like, half his age.
Hey, the heart wants what the heart wants.
well, apparently, Miss Flores visits a variety of prisoners at the men's county jail, and each time, she lists herself as girlfriend.
so, if Ray Diamond was telling the truth, that kiss goodbye contained the orders to murder the cartel banker.
which means the killer or killers may already be on the move.
I mean, the hit's supposed to happen sometime today.
I sent two sergeants to Miss Flores' home, but she hasn't been seen since last night.
excuse me, Chief. DDA Hobbs is in Pope's office.
they asked for you.
Pope's trying to hand this investigation over to county.
but on the tape, Chief, Ray Diamond told Maria Flores that he was injured after a high-speed chase with the police.
so you still have an open use-of-force complaint?
and Chief Pope cannot shut me down.
well, then Maria Flores may be an excellent witness for you.
if I can find her.
Hello, everyone.
Hey, Gavin. - Oh, Gavin, um, I'm so sorry.
I forgot you were coming.
we've just been hit with a possible murder-for-hire case, and we're just going to have to reschedule.
well, dear, what's the point in confirming our appointments if you're not going to keep them?
I've no control over when people are killed, and this case has a ticking clock on it, so...
you want to see a ticking clock?
this is my schedule today, and these are the hours for which you will be billed.
someone's life is in the balance.
well, I'm not paid to care about that.
I am paid to care about you by the hour.
Hey, Gavin.
um, Chief, come on.
we know that information is being leaked to the Baylor family's attorney by somebody in your division, and Gavin needs to interview...
everyone here.
but I haven't prepared everybody for this.
you haven't told your detectives that Gavin needs to talk to them?
no.
well, now may be a very good time to do it.
all right, uh, everyone Let me have your attention just for a moment, please.
I know that everyone's been through the wringer on this whole Shootin' Newton case, and, um, all of you saw my attorney, Gavin, at your depositions.
some of you may know him from his days as a city attorney.
of course I do.
Gavin defended me in my favorite case ever.
I was driving my car, and I ran over some dirtbag who was shooting at me.
okay?
so his parents sued me.
now, at the end of the trial, Gavin turns to the jury, and he says
turned to the jury, and he said,"Well, the Lieutenant was being shot at through his windshield.
What'd you want him to do?
honk if he loved Jesus?
Yeah.
honk if you love Jesus.
I was just gonna say that.
Yes, yes. Good times, indeed.
I take it Gavin wants to talk to us.
uh, to make a long story short, Commander, yes.
has this been cleared with our union reps?
well, I'm not swearing anyone, and it's completely confidential.
and I just have a short list here of five questions.
see?
one page.
Gabriel, this won't take long.
I'll even go first.
chief, you mind if we use your conference room?
no, no, not at all. - Thank you.
I can't wait any longer.
robert Curtis' attorney has been slow-walking us for three years.
it's already cost the taxpayers millions.
the preliminary hearing is set for today, after the judge's regular court hours.
Curtis will be there.
the murder is supposed to happen today.
according to a jailhouse snitch and convicted perjurer.
who was killed for speaking to us.
people get knocked off for all kinds of reasons in county jail, and this so-called threat can't have anything to do with Curtis.
his hearing is being held in a secret location.
where?
in a police substation off Olvera Street, which nobody -- absolutely nobody
knows about, not even the judge.
maybe the cartel has sources the judge doesn't.
right.
the death of a potential informant in this case would seem to suggest that a delay might be prudent.
no, no, no. The testimony of Robert Curtis will help defund a narco-terror organization that has been operating with impunity across our border!
I won't risk getting him scared into backing off.
what if Curtis gets assassinated on his way to court?
we have an enormous security team around him already.
do you want me to make it bigger?
by at least one.
I want to join the security detail.
Brenda. Brenda. - No, no. I don't want you involved.
look, the last time I failed to prevent a murder, we got sued -- all of us.
you really want to go through that again?
fine.
you can speak with Robert Curtis, but you will not mention a specific threat to him.
he goes to court today.
great, and I'll send your boss the bill for Chief Johnson's services.
I'm coming, too.
Fritzi, I don't think that's a good idea.
you can't both just invite yourselves into my case.
Hey, the FBI has been working this investigation, too, Hobbs.
if the cartel wants to get to Curtis, his security detail is the perfect place to start.
and you are not going anywhere bullets could be fired without me.
Oh, God. Both of you, really?
we'll blend in perfectly.
regarding Turell Baylor.
it's my understanding that a few hours before he was killed,
Mr. Baylor confessed to the Shootin' Newton murders.
Yeah, but he had an immunity deal, so we had to cut him loose.
it's all in the deposition.
and you have nothing to add to that?
good.
we're already 20% done.
so, when Chief Johnson and Detectives Gabriel and Sanchez returned from dropping Mr. Baylor off at his house, what did they say?
I don't know. Nothing, really.
you know, I guess Detective Gabriel may have said something about it being a lousy day.
and can you elaborate on what was meant by "A lousy day"?
Lousy" as in "not good,
day" as in it started off investigating a triple homicide of U. S. servicemen at 1: 30 a. m.
and ended with letting off a double murderer 18 hours later.
so, yes, it was a long, exhausting, crappy, lousy, as in "Not good," day.
next question.
who are you?
part of my security detail?
Yes, we are, sir.
I can't believe we never met before.
must be new.
rob - I'm...
Brenda Leigh Johnson, and, um, this is Fritz.
really, really nice to meet you.
you too, y-you too.
I'm gonna go check the street.
Andrea, who is that guy?
I don't like him.
we'll keep him away.
Yeah, but you...
stay close.
Oh, don't go too close to the door.
you've got pretty good eyes, as well as a firm grip.
so, tell me, Brenda Leigh Johnson, do I look crooked to you?
sir?- My tie -- does it look crooked?
I don't want to give the wrong impression on my big day in court.
no, no, no, you, uh -- you look like a billion bucks.
and from what I understand, that's chicken feed to the cartel.
the Garcias run a large business. That's true.
a business?
is, uh, that what you call it?
it's a market-driven response that operates entirely on the principle of supply and demand.
people want drugs.
the cartel distributes them.
so, yes, it's a business.
except the cartel kills people.
tell me, how many American lives have been destroyed by Wall Street traders in the last few years?
how many homes lost, pensions wiped out?
how many related suicides?
who gets arrested when an oil rig blows up in the Gulf?
the only difference between those guys and the cartel is that the Garcias know their victims by name.
now you're testifying against them?
well, I was caught, wasn't I?
but you get to walk away.
that's just the way it is, sweetheart.
the banker always walks away.
Mr. Curtis, please gather your things.
your attorney's arrived, and we'll be heading out.
gotcha, boss.
um, just one second.
I just...
thank you. - Oh, my pleasure.
I -- I was just wondering.
in all your dealings with the cartel, did you ever come across a woman named Maria Flores?
Oh, yeah, the kiss of death.
it's a little joke.
uh, Maria -- she has an odd habit.
every time she visits a guy in jail, the next day, somebody on the outside turns up dead.
she's on the Garcias' payroll.
Low-level.
who are you?-- Who is she? Nick, it's all right.
this is Brenda.
she's one of the good guys.
that's not for you to decide.
relax. I didn't say a thing. - Nick, what's wrong?
my client cannot be questioned without me being present.
what kind of game are you playing here, Andrea?
no game. - I was a deputy D. A. for 15 years.
I know all your tricks.
who are you? Who do you work for?
I work for the L. A.P. D. I'm just here to protect your client.
Nick, nobody's going around your back.
don't use this as another excuse to delay.
pardon me, gentlemen.
Nick, hey, are you listening to me? - What?
I want you to shut up. Do you understand?
you're making me nervous.
and I'm really getting tired of your mouth.
all right.
Hello?
I've found Maria Flores.
Oh, thank goodness. Where?
is there any reason she'd be on Olvera Street?
did you say Olvera Street?
correct.
I caught up with her coming out of her workplace, and I've been following her around the Plaza here for the last 20 minutes in some kind of holding pattern.
I think Maria knows the location of the secret court.
um, is she alone?
Yeah, although she could be circling in order to pick someone up.
okay, we need to find out where Maria leads you.
I'm gonna send my detectives to help.
don't pick her up unless you absolutely have to, and do not lose her.
why would I lose her?
Mr. Curtis cannot go to court today. It's not safe.
the location of the hearing has been compromised.
how do you know that it's been compromised?
because Maria Flores is driving around looking like she's waiting to pick someone up.
damn it! - What's going on?
a change of plans.
Curtis isn't going to testify today.
fine. I'll ask for a continuance.
no. You'll represent him at the hearing.
the judge just needs to know that Curtis has agreed to a deal with the D. A.'s office.
you don't think his honor will want to hear from my client himself?
you can give the judge the broad strokes.
we'll see.
you better know what you're talking about.
no. No, no, no. You stay here.
I like the thought of you being surrounded by a protection detail.
besides, Curtis would miss you.
there's nothing to say, really.
I have not discussed the case with anyone outside Major Crimes.
that's the answer to number three.
uh, number four, yes, I was aware that Turrell's family was under FBI protection.
and, number five, no, I am not on the team investigating Turrell's murder.
um, I hear they don't even have a suspect yet.
good.
and you're sure that no one who was in the car with Turrell at the time he was dropped off at his house ever spoke to you?
look, the only thing I can tell you is what I told the Baylors' lawyer, which is the same thing I told the city attorney.
and that is?
my name is Detective Julio Sanchez, Major Crimes, badge number 58323.
is this how you intend to answer all of my questions?
I have some questions of my own.
okay.
what would you like to know?
how about this one?
say a cop comes across a pile of cash just lying in the street
small bills, nonsequential.
hypothetically speaking, is he obligated to look for the person who that cash originally belonged to?
Flynn, Raydor found Maria Flores. The Chief wants us to back her up.
good talking to you, counselor.
always an experience, Lieutenant.
Gavin, punch out. Grab a coffee.
we got a problem.
Lord, have mercy.
well, that was frustrating, not to mention embarrassing.
I jumped through hoops to get the judge down here, just so Rhodes could get another continuance.
I don't know how much longer I can keep Robert Curtis on my side.
you're already relocating him.
he's not going to jail.
realistically, what more can you give him?
money.
Curtis is the only one who knows where the Garcias put all their cash?
exactly.
which makes it even more ridiculous to me that they would try and kill him.
Hello?
chief, Maria Flores just picked up a passenger -- young Latino male
we're gonna roll them up. - Good.
whatever deal you make, the FBI will probably end up with the money.
I don't care who has the cash, as long as it isn't the cartel.
where are you? - Hang on.
she's turning.
now I have to set up another sequestered hearing.
and how do we know they won't figure out where that is, too?
if this was ever an assassination attempt to begin with, which I doubt very much.
Oh, let me call my office.
what time is it?
stay on 'em! Stay on 'em!
captain, what happened?!
Where's Fritzi?! - Everyone all right?
okay, paramedics are coming.
I'm not hit. I'm not hit. - You are. You are.
Oh, my God.
careful, julio.
go left! Left! Left! Left! Left!
out of the car now! - Out of the car!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
okay, hands where we can see 'em!
don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Hands where we can see 'em now!
toss your weapon now! Do it now!
toss your weapon out of the car and get out with your hands in the air!
you, up against the building right now! Right now!
on the ground!
ial piso! On your knees!
down on your knees!
stop! Stop moving!
clear out of the way!
move! Stop moving, sir!
clear out of the way! Get out of the way!
nobody shoot. I've got him.
what are you gonna do, lady? Shoot me?
holy crap!
you got him right between the eyes.
lucky shot.
the recoil on these bean-bag guns is awful.
Oh, Fritzi.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
good job, everyone.
Andrea? - I'm okay.
just a scratch.
chief, Robert Curtis and his attorney are in interview room 2, and they are not happy.
join the club.
Maria Flores invoked, but we took her into federal custody.
we don't need her.
we found all the info on the secret court down to the room number and pictures of DDA Hobbs in the trunk of her car.
plus $15, 000 in cash, which I'm guessing was the down payment on killing you.
good to know what I'm worth.
Where's the shooter?
in the hospital, unconscious. He'll live, Chief.
can't have everything.
we I. D.'d him as Hector Medina, Mexican national.
probably sent over the border just for this job, Chief.
that explains why Maria was driving him around.
he didn't know the area.
or have a driver's license. - Chief.
visitors logs from county going back two weeks.
Oh, wonderful.
thank you.
Oh, and if you're interested, Ray Diamond was not beaten up by the officers who apprehended him.
I found a witness in jail who says that Mr. Diamond admitted that he ran into a telephone pole face-first.
you still working Diamond's use-of-force investigation?
of course.
What'd you think I was doing?
I'll be back before Gavin leaves.
why would the cartel want to kill me?
I'm replaceable.
I think you just answered your own question.
thank you, gentlemen.
is Andrea okay?
Yes, yes. She's fine. Thanks for asking.
those sons of bitches.
that could've been me.
well, remember, Mr. Curtis.
it's just business.
chief Johnson, we will not be taking questions anymore from the L. A.P. D. or DDA Hobbs.
with this brazen act of violence, we now feel the state can no longer adequately protect Mr. Curtis from the cartel.
is that true, Rob?
until you guys work this thing out, yeah.
I -- I don't feel safe.
but you weren't the target of this assassination attempt.
it was DDA Hobbs.
come on.
they may be seriously psychotic...
you're still off the clock.
why don't you have a seat?
now, suggesting that they would deliberately try anything against a DDA is completely unbelievable.
they may shoot a cop now and again, but never a prosecutor or a judge.
you're a little behind, Mr. Rhodes. We already caught the shooter.
I'm more interested in Maria Flores
the woman that your client here called "The kiss of death.
she was driving around the would-be assassin.
and that got me to thinking about something that you told me earlier today, Rob.
something I told you? About Maria?
you said that she was on the cartel's payroll.
and from what I understand, you handle all the Garcias' money.
wait, you can't think that I paid Maria to hire a hitman to kill Andrea.
shut up, Robert.
Hey, do not tell me to shut up again! - Just let me, please.
look, my client is a government witness.
it's his ass on the line here. - You haven't done anything better for me than Andrea.
your attorney is right, Rob.
you are in danger.
which is why your trial was secured down to the smallest detail.
and yet Maria Flores knew all about it.
well, I didn't tell her where it was.
I didn't even know myself.
sure you did. Your attorney here told you.
wait. Hold on a second. I never told Curtis the address.
Mr. Rhodes, you are a sworn officer of the court.
are you telling me without qualification that you did not reveal to your client the address of the secret courthouse?
we never discussed it.
I swear.
then how did the cartel's top leaderswho are all in county right now -- know the address and where to wait for DDA Hobbs?
I don't know, but this is just the kind of lapse in security that I've been worried about since this whole trial began.
two weeks ago, the cartel's Board of Directors had a board meeting...
in county lock-up.
and, uh, according to the visitors log, Mr. Rhodes, you were there.
and under "Relationship to prisoner," you wrote...
counsel. - "Counsel"?
what the hell? Nick?
look, no, no, no. See, this is just what she's trying to do, Robert, is make you talk.
now, I'm leaving.
you can't talk to my client anymore. - If I were you, I wouldn't agree to stop talking to me.
game over! - Your life depends on it.
your attorney was sitting with the cartel's Board of Directors for almost an hour.
Nick, wait. Wait! Wait!
why were you at the jail, Nick?
look...
the Garcias are representing themselves in this trial.
as the counsel for a separated co-defendant -- you
I'm entitled to ask about their defense.
and you just so happened to tell them... - Oh, my God.
...that after years of stalling, you could no longer keep Mr. Curtis here from . - Oh, my God.
making a deal with the D. A? - You're working for them.
not true!
but the cartel couldn't kill you, Mr. Curtis, without losing access to their money.
so they decided to kill DDA Hobbs instead. - That is clearly insane.
let's face it. Your lawyer is trying to put you in jail, where the Garcias can do what they want with you.
she's lying, Robert. - I'm not lying.
she's lying. - I'm not lying.
I'll prove it to you.
Nick Rhodes, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against...- Wait, wait, are you
you're reading me my rights? - You have the right to an attorney.
have you lost your mind?!
I don't need to be read my rights! I've done nothing wrong.
so, if I check your personal and business accounts,
I won't find a transaction where you paid Maria Flores $15, 000?
no. - Hang on.
wait. - What?
Oh, my God. Nick, you had m
he told me to sign off on a $15, 000 cash distribution yesterday.
Robert, stop talking.
so, you admit you're still handling the cartel's money?
Yeah, he told me to keep managing their finances... - No, be quiet, Robert.
so they wouldn't know that I was flipping on them. - You're incriminating yourself!
no, I'm incriminating you!
he's been telling me what to do with the money ever since we started this deal
including paying for my defense.
that's my cue. Excuse me.
is that true, Mr. Rhodes?
even if I wanted to answer you, I'm constrained by privilege.
my first and only concern must be Robert.
you appear to have been running Mr. Curtis for the cartel all along, and that makes you part of a criminal enterprise.
privilege doesn't cover that.
criminal enterpri-- look, it's no secret Robert had money from these guys.
but it's not money. - How much did they promise you, Nick?
what? - To hand me over to those animals?
you know what they'd do to me in jail. You know!
Mr. Curtis, you remember Special Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI?
since you just confessed to paying for the assassination attempt on DDA Hobbs, 12 customers of the coffee shop, and, of course, me,
I'm here to take you into federal custody.
No! This is not right. I had a deal.
the state can have you when we're done -- in about 14 lifetimes.
Bye, Rob. It's been fun.
you bitch! - I told you to shut up, Robert.
now they don't need you anymore.
they need me.
look I'm not the bad guy here.
how did you become the criminal you used to put in jail?
Oh, I don't need a lecture on morality from Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
you're the one who put a guy on the street to be beaten to death, not me.
Oh, yeah, I looked into you.
don't forget, I represent criminals.
and...
you hear everything in jail.
just because you didn't beat Turell Baylor to death with your own two hands doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
you're no different from me.
Oh, my. This is taking a nasty turn, isn't it?
so...
...this is what happens next.
you...Get me...
a deal.
and I get you back all the cartel's money that I tricked Curtis into giving me.
I have a better idea.
how 'bout you write down how you paid Maria Flores $15, 000 to help assassinate DDA Hobbs?
and, in return, I'll arrest you on 14 counts of attempted murder.
that's the only deal you're gonna get.
take it or leave it.
what? Seriously?
look, that is not a deal.
listen, Johnson.
without me, you will never, ever find the cartel's money.
understand? Never.
I don't care about the money.
I care about all the people who nearly died today, including my husband.
now, I have enough probable cause to arrest you and send you over to county, where you can live it up with all your cartel friends.
I'm sure they'd be thrilled to see you, especially considering how cooperative you just offered to be.
you know...
they hear everything in jail.
wait, hold on. Now, wait a minute.
you wouldn't dare.
when you see Turell Baylor in hell, you ask him what I wouldn't dare to do.
Oh, my God.
she doesn't mean it, Gavin.
Baylor's caused her a lot of grief.
if she can get a little mileage out of him, why not?
as much as I'd like to kill him myself, I'll put Rhodes in protective custody.
so don't worry, Gavin.
thank you, dear. That would be a big help.
my God, this woman.
no, no, no, no. Look. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
put that pen to paper.
be quick...or be gone.
I heard the Chief agree to protect Turell's I mother and sister, but I don't know who's looking into his murder.
I'm a civilian tech. I'm not a police officer.
and did the Chief or Detectives Gabriel and Sanchez speak to you after they dropped Turell off at his house?
Yes.
chief Johnson asked me if I had any Ding Dongs.
excuse me?
she sometimes has Ding Dongs on rough days, and after she came back, she ran out.
always tough running out of Ding Dongs.
okay, so, let's just go over these questions again and make sure we got them all right.
I can save you some time.
number one, no. Number two, no. Number three...
we'll come back to.
number four, I don't know and I don't care.
number five, also no.
now, back to number three for a second.
have I discussed this case with anyone outside Major Crimes?
have you?
love you, love your work, but I'm out of here.
all right. All right. Listen up, everyone.
now, I know we've all been through hell because of this damn witch hunt, but these questions imply that one of us is cooperating with the Baylors' attorney.
and I find that insulting to my character and to that of everyone else in this room.
for the record, I find it insulting, too.
well, for the record, as well, there's simply no way that Mr. Goldman knows what he knows about Major Crimes without inside information.
so, somewhere in this division, there's a leak.
okay, then.
well, it was really nice spending time with all of you today.
we'll be meeting again soon.
wait up, Gavin.
did you learn anything?
nothing I didn't already suspect.
see, everyone here talks to everyone else here about everything.
so, if one person knows something, you all do.
so, to that leak that you don't think exists...
...can you please tell Mr. Goldman...
...that he can sneak around all he wants to, but if this case ever gets to a courtroom...
...I win.
no matter what he thinks he knows...
...I win.
no matter what lies he gets passed...
...I win.
but in the meantime, please be safe, everybody.
it is a rough world out there.
and it's getting rougher every day.
superior Court of the county of Los Angeles.
the family of Turell Baylor vs. The City of Los Angeles,
Los Angeles Police Department, Mayor Ramon Quintero, interim Chief of Police William Pope,
deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, the Major Crimes division of the Los Angeles Police Department, and several John Does.
case number 0-5-C-0-1-3-1.
judge Gerald Blake presiding.
state your appearances for the record.
Peter Goldman appearing for the plaintiff, Your Honor.
Gavin Q. Baker and City Attorney Lee for the defense, Your Honor.
I have read the defense's motion for a summary judgment and the papers filed in opposition.
I think there very well might be some triable issues of material fact.
Yes. Your Honor, I ask you to look at page six of Mr. Goldman's pleading, where he states, "Turell Baylor was murdered by person or persons unknown.
defense regards this as an admission against interest.
if counsel has no idea who killed Mr. Baylor, how do we proceed?
your Honor,
deputy Chief Johnson abandoned Turell Baylor in gang territory, where his fellow Crips were massing to execute him.
excuse me, Your Honor.
chief Johnson dropped Mr. Baylor off at his house, where he requested to go.
it's not the defendant's fault that Mr. Baylor lived in gang territory.
your Honor, everyone knows Turell Baylor was murdered by members of his own gang.
your Honor, if everyone knows this, why has counsel submitted no evidence substantiating this fact?
instead, he asks the court to try his opinion
an improper use of the justice system.
even if one were to accept that in this instance the Warren rule did not apply.
the Warren Rule would only apply if Chief Johnson had been negligent.
she wasn't negligent.
she actively facilitated the murder of Turell Baylor.
this motion for summary judgment is a feeble excuse to get that charge to just go away.
I congratulate counsel on so swiftly dividing both our objective and the definition of a summary judgment, which is to immediately terminate these proceedings in favor of the defendants and to make these "baseless charges," as he puts it, just go away.
I notice defendants aren't even waiting for Your Honor's ruling to go away.
your Honor, I am saddened to announce that just moments ago, a Deputy Sheriff was shot and killed.
I hope Your Honor is not offended, understanding that police officers are oftentimes required to put public safety ahead of personal interest.
anything further, Mr. Goldman?
Hey, Chief.
so, two plainclothes Deputy Sheriffs were driving south on Crenshaw when one of them recognized a stolen Maserati by its license plates.
are these vanity plates? It doesn't look it to me.
anyway, they were following the stolen vehicle when the thieves must have realized they had been made.
thieves" -- that's plural? Two guys in the front seats, Chief.
Maserati turned in to this dead-end, did a 180, front-seat passenger came out firing -- bam-bam!
bam-bam! Bam!
.45 auto -- at the sheriff's vehicle, killing Deputy Brian Rush, who was behind the wheel.
shooter took off on foot.
the victim's partner wasn't hit.
he was able to wrestle the cuffs on the other suspect.
shooter's already escaped, carjacked a woman two blocks away.
knocked her down pretty hard, too.
she's in the hospital, but she'll live.
I put a want out on her car. It's a Honda.
please make sure the driver of the escaped vehicle is designated armed and dangerous.
I don't want anyone else walking into an ambush.
if the car's found parked somewhere, it's "Stake and notify." Thank you.
Hey, Chief.
you want to meet our newest contender for asshole of the year?
that's the other car thief? He looks 15.
we I. D.'d him from his cellphone
Kyle Hayes, age 22.
got one prior for breaking and entering.
well, Kyle just made an aggressive leap forward in his criminal career.
chief Johnson, Deputy Mike Burton.
deputy, I'm -- I'm so sorry about your partner.
do you need a minute? No, let's go. How can I help?
y'all were a long way from West Hollywood this morning.
Brian and I had been looking for a missing witness in a criminal trial, and we were headed out to Boyle Heights following a tip when he recognized the license plates of a Maserati right ahead of us as belonging to a stolen car.
recognized the plates how?
was there a special alert out on the Maserati?
no, no. I -- the, uh
the sheriff's office has a special-problems unit, part of a joint task force with the FBI looking for a ring of car thieves targeting a bunch of high-end vehicles.
they put out a list of license plates once a month.
so you found the car, started following it.
why didn't you radio for backup? It all happened so fast.
we saw the car, changed lanes behind it, we turned the corner, and we were short stopped.
I mean, they must have flagged us somehow.
chief.
pardon me, Deputy.
sheriff understands it's our case now.
I say we take the suspect we have, get him into an interview room, and see if we can convince him to give up the shooter before he kills again. Uh, Lieutenant Tao,
I want you to personally pull all prints from that Maserati.
see if we can identify the killer.
buzz, please gather all security video from businesses between here and where the carjacking took place.
a picture of the shooter would be nice. Thank you.
and, uh, Commander, please keep Deputy Burton close at hand.
sheriff's protocol is Burton goes back to his home department, exchanges his gun, and gets his rep.
I understand that, but when we find the killer,
I may need Burton's help in identifying him.
lieutenant Provenza, I'd like you to supervise the search for the escape vehicle, please. Thank you.
meanwhile, I'll work with the suspect we do have.
you can leave us alone.
you and I both know you don't have to speak, but...
I've been at this job a while.
met a lot of young boys who got into trouble just from hanging around with the wrong crowd.
does that describe you, or are you a cop killer?
I've got the Chief's interview up recording for you.
Thanks.
I ask if you're a cop killer because, unless we find your accomplice, the D. A. will charge you as one. I never even pulled my gun.
under California law, you're as responsible for the death of Deputy Sheriff Rush as your friend.
now, I don't want to charge you, Kyle, but I have to follow the law.
if you follow it with me, I can help you out of this mess.
give me the name of the man who was in that car with you, and I can save you.
now, listen to me, Kyle.
if I find the man who shot and killed a sheriff's deputy without your help, you're gonna spend the rest of your life on death row.
you've made a lot of bad choices today.
don't let this be one of them.
yes?
yes?!
chief, I've I. D.'d some prints.
be back in a minute, Kyle.
you better hope I still need your help.
altogether, I pulled 12 prints off the Maserati.
three belonged to the owner, two belonged to Hayes, leaving seven prints that match up with three other known criminals.
three other known criminals? - Mm-hmm.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, how many people does it take to steal a car these days?
deputy Burton said that there were just two people in that Maserati.
I have some mug shots.
now, one of them might match up to a picture
I found on Kyle's cellphone -- David Cobb.
now, his prints were in the car.
this picture's low resolution, but I suppose I can bump up the contrast ratio.
but that gets a bit tricky because
lieutenant, please, just give me the mug shots.
I need to show them to the suspect.
we're getting closer. Yeah, thank you.
if Kyle sees how far along we are, maybe he'll get us the rest of the way home.
he's got a gun!
call S. W.A. T.
monitor. Monitor.
Kyle, there are cameras in there!
I'm watching you! I'm watching you right now!
I can see you!
Kyle, I want you to put that gun on the table and step to the far corner of the room!
Kyle, put the gun on the table, and step to the far corner of the room! Now!
Oh, man.
what a totally screwed-up day.
this bullet was meant for you.
chief, this was not your fault.
if Burton didn't find the gun when he cuffed Hayes, then our patrol officers should have found it when they took custody or when they brought him in here.
no.
it was my responsibility to make sure that Kyle was properly searched before he entered the interview room.
and it's an...
in-custody death, so F. I.D. has every right to be here.
chief Johnson.
Provenza.
listen, patrol found the Honda. It's at 8th and Alameda.
now, we can sit on it, but I am certain that the killer dumped it and
no, no, no, no, no.
lieutenant Tao has prints from multiple suspects to check against whatever's inside the vehicle.
please hold off on that search until he gets there.
8th and Alameda.
what about the other guy? Is he talking?
you could say he invoked his right to remain silent.
Uh...Lieutenant Tao will explain when he gets there.
chief, I can't leave until F. I.D. interviews me.
no, no, no, no, no.
this is a time-sensitive situation. They're just gonna have to wait.
lieutenant Provenza is at this address with the Honda the killer used to escape.
take the prints that you pulled off the Maserati this morning, check them against whatever's inside that vehicle, and get me a positive I. D. on the shooter.
that's an order, Lieutenant.
okay, Buzz.
thank you...
for saving my life.
now, let's see if you can act.
sorry about all this.
uh...how are you doing? I've had easier mornings.
cheer up.
a cop killer just shot himself, so one down, one to go.
about this suicide
I tried to talk her out of it, but Captain Raydor insists on speaking with you before you resume the investigation. I expected to be questioned.
at least it was just Buzz and me here.
right, yes. Excellent work, Buzz.
thank you, sir. - Thank you.
Kyle? - - This bullet was meant for you.
thank you.
are you okay?
I-I think so, yes.
from what I just saw, you nearly died.
okay.
who else in your division was with you?
as you could see from the recording, I was alone.
someone knocked on the door to your interview room and pulled you out.
I did that, Captain.
chief Johnson didn't have her earwig with her, and I had breaking information from Lieutenant Provenza.
would you mind leaving us alone, please?
chief, you know it's always risky to leave a suspect alone in an interview room.
I know procedure wasn't properly followed, and it's a bad day to have it happen.
I wish I'd done better, but...
I'm looking for someone who's a lot worse than me.
and I'm just asking for this day to see if I can find him.
just this day -- that's all I'm asking. I can absolutely do that.
I've got 72 hours to file this report, so I will just resume this part of the investigation after that.
and in the meantime, I will interview every single officer who had charge of that suspect between the crime scene and your interview room.
where can I find the deputy sheriff who took Mr. Hayes into custody?
uh, Commander Taylor is keeping track of him.
okay.
th-thank you, Captain.
Thanks.
okay.
they'll make a new rule for searching suspects.
I promise you -- they'll make a new rule.
if there are people getting into the building with guns, then maybe there should be a new rule.
radial arch with a delta.
nine ridges.
Heh. It's David Cobb!
I have pictures of him right here.
his last known address is 544 South Berendo.
I'll call for the warrant. - We don't need a warrant, Mike.
this is fresh pursuit. Sanchez, come with me.
call S. I.S.
I want undercover units in a three-block radius around Cobb's house.
you guys take these photos of our suspect. Walk around here.
see if somebody can identify him.
if he's still in the vicinity, or if he comes back again -- well, come on.
be careful.
let's split up.
no.
none of my people have seen him, either.
okay, and you know that without even asking them?
well, he's the same guy the other cop was looking for an hour ago.
supposed to have carjacked an old lady's Honda somewhere, yeah?
wait, wait. This other cop, did he give you his card or you get his name?
no.
but now that you ask, he wasn't a cop. He was a sheriff's deputy.
thank you.
Yeah, all right. - We'll, uh, we'll sort it out.
thank you.
deputy Burton is missing?
chief, I did just like you asked.
I told the sheriff's office to have Burton call us when he finished giving his statement, and now
but now we can't find him, can we?
they -- - No, you!
you, Commander -- I asked you to keep an eye on him, and now we have no idea where Burton is or what he's doing.
the sheriff's department is putting about 100 people on the street to find him.
this will work out. I promise.
we've cleared the houses next to the Cobb residence, Lieutenant, and across the street.
okay. Everyone ready?
take the back.
you stay with Detective Sanchez. You stay with me.
all right.
be careful. Heads up, now.
set.
go!
stay where you are! Don't move!
hands behind your head! Get your hands above your head!
up! Above your head!
clear.
it's not what it looks like.
it better not be.
read him his rights, Julio.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you by the state.
which killed Deputy Rush, was the same one used on David Cobb.
and Deputy Burton's weapon? Not fired.
well, that doesn't mean anything.
he could have shot Cobb with Cobb's own gun.
so, you didn't give the suspect the gun he shot himself with, did you?
Gavin, that's not funny.
mm, you know what else isn't funny?
you having another in-custody death without informing your attorney.
Turell Baylor was not an in-custody death.
well, that's not what Goldman is saying.
and 30 minutes ago, he demanded a continuance based on relevant, new information, which he possessed and I did not.
goldman knows about this already? How?
from the leak in the division, which you refuse to believe exists.
Oh, my God.
I was on the verge of having this entire case thrown out.
now it's up in the air.
Where's Captain Raydor? She's back in her office. Why?
I have to talk to her before another lawsuit is filed against you by the family of your newest dead suspect.
you know, if you could afford it,
I could drop everyone else in my practice and defend you for a living.
you know that man was going to kill me?
maybe he thought he'd end up representing you in court.
It's...Natural causes.
you're using up all your nine lives, baby. You know that, don't you?
deputy Burton said that the stolen Maserati had something to do with a special-problems unit
some kind of joint task force between the sheriff's office and the FBI.
Yeah, it's a special problem, all right. Come here.
take a look. We got a flag on your stolen Maserati this morning.
there's a ring of high-tech car thieves.
is this gang related? - No, no.
this is a professional organization, run by a competent and disciplined adult.
okay.
35 vehicles stolen during the first week of every month.
probably has something to do with the shipping schedule.
here's the theory -- two thieves steal a car.
they use a computer to generate a counterfeit electronic key.
they drive the car to a spot where they can disconnect the vehicle-recovery system and watch it for a while.
and when they're sure they haven't been followed, two middlemen come in with fake customs documents.
they drive the stolen car somewhere near the port to be sent overseas.
so two thieves steal a car, and two other guys ship it off.
that explains why there were four sets of prints in the Maserati this morning.
and, uh, Deputy Burton and, uh, Rush
were either of them part of this special-problems unit?
no, but they both applied to join several times and several times were told they lacked seniority.
no, why were they both so determined to be part of this investigation?
because the sheriff's office and the FBI weren't getting anywhere.
they kept arresting guys in the act of stealing the cars.
so, what, you have a problem with interrupting property theft?
if you're looking for the guy who's in charge, yes, I do.
you pick up a couple low-level guys grabbing a Lexus
what do you have? Two little fish who won't say who they're working for, who lawyer up, spend a little time in county while we learn nothing.
Brian and I had another idea.
I can't think why the sheriff's office didn't hand over the entire investigation to you, considering how brilliantly you do your job.
Yeah, like the young man you searched this morning when you arrested him -- that was remarkable.
it was just great. Okay, look -- I'm sorry I missed the gun.
my adrenaline was pumping. My partner was dead.
I was trying to figure out the right thing to do and some way to contain the damage. - That deputy just took responsibility for not searching a suspect this morning.
should we run off a copy of this interview, give it to Gavin to show the judge?
Yeah. Yeah, when we're done here.
you thought chasing down your partner's killer with information that you did not share with us -- that was "containing the damage"?
hear me out, and then tell me I was wrong!
we'll listen, but bear in mind, my concern here is murder, not stolen cars.
look...
Brian and I, we were just...
...Hunting for a chance to make our mark.
and we kept looking at the special-problems-unit reports and they didn't seem to be getting any closer to catching the big fish -- the guy in charge.
so the last few months, whenever we could make the time, we staked out a parking structure on Santa Monica Boulevard. And last week, we got lucky.
watched a couple guys on laptops create a key for a brand-new Maserati and drive off in it.
we managed to stay with them all the way to a parking lot at 8th and Alameda, and we sat on that car till this morning.
why didn't you call for backup?
cause we couldn't control the bureaucratic response, you know?
the special-problems unit massed, they might get a few vehicles back, but the parking lot would be burnt.
no to mention, you'd have to share credit for your big idea.
did you ever see anyone surveilling the parking lot?
no.
did anyone ever see you? - No.
but we did spot a lot of other cars being dropped off.
that lot is filled with stolen vehicles.
all right, then.
so, two guys came to pick up the stolen Maserati this morning.
and they weren't the little fish who had stolen the car in the first place, either.
these were middlemen, at least
coming to drive the Maserati off to be shipped somewhere.
they parked the vehicle they came in up the street, walked to the Maserati, and drove off in it, toward the port.
and we followed at a good distance for about 10 minutes, thinking our plan had worked, and we had a couple of the higher ups and were just minutes away from finding out where these cars were being loaded up.
then...
for some reason, the guys in the Maserati made a sharp turn, some kind of counter- surveillance move, I guess.
we went after them, and
your plan
it worked so well that your partner was shot to death.
okay, so, tell us
how did you end up at the killer's house?
wait a minute.
when those guys came to pick up the Maserati this morning, they left their own vehicle behind.
so, when I was with you at the crime s scene, you knew that the killer would be trying to get back to his car, is that right?
I thought maybe, yeah, but Cobb's car was gone when I got there, so I ran his plates, which we had written down.
and I had his DMV photo faxed to me.
checked with area businesses to see if he was hiding in the neighborhood somewhere.
then I drove to his house, went in through the back door, and Cobb was already dead.
I was
I was about to clear the house and call my office when your guys came in through the front
so, after your partner
your partner -- was shot dead, you kept on playing supercop, correct? I was following the lead!
right over the line that we are never, ever supposed to cross.
you know, the justice system works pretty well until someone starts thinking that they're smarter than the sheriff's office, the FBI, and the entire L. A.P. D. combined!
do you see what happens when you throw away the rule book, Deputy?
people die! - I'm sorry!
do you think she's conscious of what she's saying?
somebody may want to play back this part of the interview for her when she gets home tonight.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.
but you have the parking lot.
and we know that the middlemen are moving the vehicles to the port today.
and they may have paused to see what we would do, but if they haven't abandoned the place
killing Cobb, that was just the big fish trying to contain his own situation.
he has a schedule to keep and lots of other cars to move.
we made mistakes...
...but we did not burn the lot.
okay.
so, if the parking lot is good, the question is, what do we do with it?
Brenda, listen to me. If this ends up taking a while, you will want to head over to the courtroom and hear the judge rule on your motion. Oh, she'll go.
I promise you. - Thank you.
fine, but remember, we're not just rounding up a bunch of car thieves.
these are murderers, too. And someone is watching this place.
just because Burton never figured out who, doesn't mean they aren't here.
and I'm not interested in catching a bunch of little fish and letting the sharks swim away.
now, where have I heard that before? Just be careful.
gentlemen.
tao. - Hmm.
11 o'clock.
boots?
Yeah.
here -- psst! - Wow.
what's this?
here we go.
chief, we have an Aston Martin, license plate 3-Y-T-K-1-1-8.
okay, let's see here.
we got a winner.
stolen five days ago in Beverly Hills. Good luck, guys.
copy that.
fellas, we're gonna let them lead from behind till we get on the freeway.
remember, do not take any unnecessary risks with these people.
consider them armed and extremely dangerous.
fellas, we're gonna do a little trade.
let them pass.
and here we are. Coming up to the port.
keep your weapons handy. Here we go. Copy that.
here we go, Chief.
police! Right there
don't move! Put your hands up! Turn around!
put your hands behind you. - Face the car!
hands behind your head. Face the door!
call, call, call, call.
Hello?
Hey. We're all safe here.
...with two fresh suspects.
Plus, the loading site and customs documents.
wait. Hold on. Here's Flynn on speaker.
okay, Chief, the stolen cars are headed for Argentina, being shipped inside containers that arrived here filled with beef. And that means refrigerated shipping, the perfect way to get cars with built-in computers out of the country.
did you say Argentina?
Yeah, yeah. Look, it's an enormous break for the case, but, look, there's still no sign of the big fish, so why don't you and Gabriel sit tight?
you're likely to spot some more middlemen 'cause I'm looking at a bunch of empty containers here, so, odds are, more cars are gonna be leaving the lot.
we'll wait for them here and follow up with the two suspects we just apprehended.
uh, hold on just a second.
buzz, do an Internet search on the word "Recoleta.
see if it has some kind of special connection to Argentina.
in Spanish, recoleta means "calm,
but it's also the name of a neighborhood in Buenos Aires.
um, honey, while you're finishing up with those people, would you do me a favor?
a favor? In about two minutes, could you give the suspects their phone calls?
well, if I give the suspects their phone calls, they might alert the big fish.
that's what I'm counting on. I have to hang up now.
Yeah, well, ho
okay... Buzz, would you please call for backup?
and, David, let's be careful here.
I want to scare this guy, not start a shooting match.
I'm with you on that.
Hey, guys, hold on a second. These dirtbags have to make some calls.
we're closed. Dinner starts at 5: 30.
it's all right. I'm not hungry, really.
it's you again.
did you find your fugitive?
no, but, actually, we think he may still be in the area.
I'll be on my guard, then. Thank you for stopping by.
excuse me.
sorry.
you have a moment to answer a few questions?
sure. I'm a-always happy to help the police.
let me, uh, let me put this in my office.
I'll be back in five, okay?
I'll wait here.
okay.
sir, I've had a terrible day.
I'm anxious, and I'm stressed and a little shaky. Ah-ah.
so, if you don't drop your gun right now,
I'm gonna put a bullet through your head.
are we clear?
thank you.
Why? Why are you arresting me?
cause shooting you would get us in a lot of trouble.
Mateo Ríos, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
please be seated.
the family of Turell Baylor vs. The City of Los Angeles.
deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson, et al, we are back on the record.
before my ruling,
I'd like it known that, whatever crimes Mr. Baylor may have committed, he was entitled to be tried in a court, not the streets of L. A.
Mr. Goldman, the lack of evidence supporting the central thesis behind your pleading leaves me no choice but to grant the defense its motion for summary judgment. Case dismissed.
Ooh. I told you I was going to win.
you might have told me how.
well, then you would've told the leak, and then where would we be?
I still cannot believe that it's all over.
well, don't worry.
we'll have another crisis soon enough, and I'll lead us all through that one, too.
now, that's just what I was about to say. Thank you for showing us the way.
everyone, to Gavin! Oh, yes.
Oh, thank you. To Gavin!
congratulations, Chief.
listen, I just want to thank you for...
standing by me. I know it hasn't been easy.
chief, if our job was easy,
no one would put up with either one of us.
you're no more difficult to deal with than I am. I mean that as a compliment.
well, thank you... Sharon.
I'm very grateful to you. I really am.
you're welcome.
will, what's the matter?
something wrong?
I'm not sure, but I need you to talk to someone without losing your temper.
you think you can do that?
well, I can't promise anything, but I'll try.
who is it?
congratulations, Chief Johnson.
just be sure to get more information out of him than he gets from us, okay?
okay.
you have two minutes. I'm timing you.
I hope you don't mind my crashing your victory party.
not at all.
gives me a chance to say my final goodbye.
I look forward to never seeing you again.
maybe I'm born to disappoint you.
why do you say that?
because after losing in the state of California today,
I filed a new case on the federal level.
you did?
I did.
and this lawsuit isn't going to be focusing entirely on Turell Baylor's death...
as shameful as that was.
no.
it also concerns the son of a Russian crime boss, who was working as an FBI informant and who died the same night you revealed that cooperation to his father's lawyer.
Oh, did I mention that he'd just been released from your custody?
and then, there was the child molester who you threatened to put into general population after he confessed -- Mr. Stimple
hanged himself
again, in custody.
it's an unfortunate trend with you, actually, because a short time afterwards, you arrested a police officer from Tijuana under a false name, who was then murdered in jail.
it doesn't seem like a coincidence to me.
then there was the suicide in your interview room today.
not to mention how you continually harass my colleague, calling his clients, bad-mouthing him to other law-enforcement agencies.
Phillip Stroh raped and murdered a young girl from Missouri the night before her 30th birthday.
prove it. In a court of law.
that's the problem with you, frankly.
what one knows and what one can prove are two different things.
you don't seem to get that.
so, you represent a man who confessed to murdering prostitutes,
that's a pretty impressive list to add to the saintly Turell Baylor.
and together, they all add up to a past practice and pattern of denying suspects their constitutional privilege to a fair trial.
that is a civil rights violation for which you, the L. A.P. D. and the City of Los Angeles are going to pay... Dearly.
my two minutes are up.
besides, I have a very large discovery motion to file.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Mr. Goldman.
do you have some kind of personal vendetta against me?
I mean, have I ever done anything to you or -- or someone you love?
no.
in fact, I'm reasonably sure we have almost never crossed paths.
but that's mainly because I'm the conscience of the justice system, which, as far as you're concerned, makes me nearly a perfect stranger.
but don't worry.
by the time I'm done, we're gonna know each other very well.
because it's my intention, Chief Johnson, to put an end to you...
and all your works.
Casey, don't mess with my camera.
come on, Buzzy.
you're supposed to be Mr. Holiday Spirit.
mom said she wanted pictures of you, too.
well, use your cellphone, then.
an entrance fee of $20 per adult?
merry Christmas, suckers.
Oh, the North Pole Village is such a racket.
a racket? What do you mean?
in case you haven't noticed, everything here has a price tag on it.
why we still come here every Christmas, I do not know.
look, Santa's coming in on a zip line this year, from all the way up there.
how about that?
Oh, I miss the float.
it was old-fashioned, but at least it was charming.
why do you like this Santa so much?
it's ridiculous.
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we are minutes from Santa's arrival.
so let's gather by the workshop for a holiday surprise.
as we usher in a new season of joy, let's put our mittens together and give a warm, jolly welcome to the man of the hour, as he flies in directly from the North Pole.
...6...5... Okay, Casey, smile.
...4...3...2...1! No! Oh, God! No!
here, take this.
Casey, stay here.
don't worry, boys and girls.
what's wrong?
Oh, God!
thank you, Buzz, for bringing me up to speed.
nice to meet you, Casey.
don't let this ruin your visit.
thank you, Chief Johnson.
how do we know this wasn't an accident?
l. A. city fire department inspected the zip line that our victim was using, and it appears that someone tampered with the brakes.
this trolley Santa was riding uses two pads to create the friction necessary for stopping.
one of these pads was pried loose.
it also has a battery-powered back-up system, but no battery.
and the entire kit is rented from a company called "Zip Xperience."
the owner says they ran trials yesterday afternoon, and both brakes were working properly.
so, according to the elves
I've been waiting to say that my entire life
according to the elves, our dead Santa's name was Randy Mann.
DMV has him residing in Humboldt.
and our young St. Nick has a sheet
two prior arrests for cultivating and distributing marijuana.
Oh, over there, the crying elf
that's his wife, Lisa.
I count two crying elves.
well, the other one's Carmen.
seems, uh, Santa played the field a little.
Hey, he's not the real Santa.
you sure about that, Buzz?
what my brother means is, the guy who really runs this little con job of a Christmas village is Santa Jack.
after the accident, I saw him run back into his workshop.
okay. Thank you, Casey.
I'll be back in a minute.
so [clears throat] Buzzy, why don't you introduce us to Casey?
Oh, he doesn't need to.
you are Detective Sanchez, the one who threatens people.
you are Lieutenant Tao, of course, oh, and that's your bag of tricks. Mm.
you are the very sharp-dressing Detective Gabriel.
hello. - Thank you.
judging by the cynical tone in your voice, you must be Andy Flynn.
Hi.
and that makes you the grumpy one, Lieutenant Provenza.
hello. - Grumpy?
well, when I'm being shot at, maybe.
but the rest of the time, I am just a cuddly Teddy bear.
lieutenant, Casey's afraid of bears.
Oh. Excuse us, please.
we don't want to interfere with your work.
Bye.
this is a disaster.
I understand that the zip line was a new feature and that you used to enter on a holiday float?
Yeah. That burned down to its gearbox.
no one knows how.
sorry about the smoke
usually not allowed in the workshop.
how did this happen?
poor Santa Randy.
I had the whole thing rigged up the right way.
I was supposed to go down, land on the platform, and go down the chimney myself.
but when I tried out the zip line yesterday, believe me, Santa screamed words that no children should ever hear.
and I take my job as role model very seriously.
eggnog?
no, thanks. I'm...on duty.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
sorry. I'm having a few very bad months here.
I run a Halloween fair, too
a haunted house, corn maze, pumpkin patch -- everything.
one boy got botulism -- one boy, and the county shut down my entire operation for a month.
and my sleigh gave out.
your sleigh?
Yeah, red minivan. I call it my sleigh.
cost over $1, 000 to fix.
and now Santa Randy is dead.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
were you and Randy close?
Santa Randy.
Yeah, great kid.
he's been selling trees here since he dropped out of college.
but, of course, he wanted more out of life.
so being a good guy, I-I sent him to Santa school last September, bought him the suit, paid for him to join the order.
I understand that Randy and his wife -- - Santa Randy.
...Santa -- Santa Randy and his wife, Lisa, were having problems.
well, yeah, after work, there may have been a few of what we refer to around here as, uh, "Reindeer Games.
pole dancing" -- that kind of thing.
and I understand Santa Randy was a little overly friendly with the elves this year.
Oh, Santa Randy.
but let me tell you -- Lisa had a very hard time adjusting to Randy's new station in life.
she had married a man -- whew!
and he had become part of a legend.
and I can tell you from personal experience, the role of Mrs. Claus is more than most women can handle.
sorry.
some ashes there.
my fault.
look, Santa, I need you to come downtown and give me a statement about this zip line.
well, there's absolutely no problem there.
excuse me. One second.
he would have wanted me to have it!
he was my husband, you slut!
he didn't love you anymore!
it's all legally mine! - It's not yours! Ladies!
girls ????
ladies, come on. All right, that
now, Gabriel, give them a sec.
one of them might say something incriminating.
elves! Elves!
please!
all right, I've had enough.
put 'em all under arrest!
all right, let's go. Let's go.
everybody, let's go.
Hey, you -- you come back here! You come
you -- you are a very strong elf.
okay. All right. All right. Okay.
okay. You -- hey!
Santa is not gonna like this.
this is a lot of Christmas cheer, Chief
drugs, cash.
add in the elf sex...
three very traditional motives for murder.
it's just so hard to believe that someone would use a Christmas village to sell drugs.
well, people use Christmas - Casey.
to sell everything.
and that's what Santa Jack was all about. - Casey.
we do not interrupt detectives when they're discussing a case.
chief, I'm -- I'm very sorry.
no, no, no, no. It's fine.
I think your sister might have a point.
with the amount of drugs we have here, we should be able to get a warrant for everyone who works at the North Pole's...
...Credit reports. - Mm-hmm.
and make sure that you include the victim's wife, uh, please.
let's see if anyone has more money in the bank than they ought to.
excuse me. - Okay.
we're supposed to be going to your attorney's office right now.
well, I don't know if you've heard, but someone murdered Santa Claus.
look, Pope pulled Raydor off your back with the understanding that you would focus, focus, focus on this federal lawsuit, which, first and foremost, means keeping appointments with your lawyer.
I took off work today to go with you.
I can't believe you're even thinking about being late, let alone not showing up at all.
what is wrong with you? - Hey, hey, hey.
you have the right to remain jolly.
now pull it together. We need to leave.
okay.
everyone, look, uh, I have to go.
but, uh, you know, Santa Jack should have been here by now.
let's find out where he's gotten to.
and I-I need to know who else had access to that zip line between the last safety check and our accident, which is what we're going to be calling this until we can sort out who's been...
naughty and who's been nice.
thank you.
well, it's clear now, that Goldman only brought that Baylor suit against you in the hopes of establishing a leak in your division.
and he has used that leak to amass an impressive list of litigants for this federal lawsuit of his.
so, Brenda...
why don't we take a little walk down memory lane, which, for you, leads through a cemetery, okay?
okay.
in addition to Turell Baylor, whose death I now look back upon with a certain fond nostalgia, we have the very thuggy Nick Koslov, son of a Russian crime boss.
who confessed to stabbing teenage prostitutes to death.
he was murdered after you alerted his family's attorney that the young Mr. Koslov was also an informant for the FBI.
Yeah, that was not a good day.
and began a troublesome pattern you continued with Roger Stimple.
a child molester who confessed to murdering three little girls.
and hanged himself in jail after you "forgot
to put him in protective custody.
then there's Martin Vasquez, a Mexican federale whom you arrested under another name
coincidentally, the name of someone Vasquez had paid to have murdered in jail.
also, by complete coincidence,
Mr. Vasquez died within an hour of landing behind bars.
Vasquez was a corrupt cop responsible for dozens of homicides, working for the Garcia cartel.
and then, of course, we have Kyle, who shot himself in your interview room.
cause he couldn't kill me.
and lastly, but not leastly, Phillip Stroh.
what? Stroh?
he's not dead. Is he?
surprisingly, no, but your wife has been harassing him for over two years.
and, in addition to badmouthing him to the authorities, chasing away his clients...
Brenda, what the hell? People he's defending have a right to know who they're dealing with. You have to be -- are you out of your mind?
in addition to all of that, every year on May 5th,
Mr. Stroh receives a mysterious bouquet of flowers from the deceased Jessica Goodall.
a little bit creepy.
I want Stroh never to forget what I know, and that is that he raped and murdered Jessica February 5th, 2008, the night before her 30th birthday.
if you know that, why didn't you arrest him and try him in court?
why are you being so mean?
I am not being mean.
I'm simply presenting a more mild version of Goldman's case, and if you respond to him the way you responded to me, the L. A.P. D. will have to institute costly new custodial procedures, and you and Fritz could end up forking over every penny you have in punitive damages.
that's all for today.
before I forget...
I have a gift for the two of you.
in the spirit of the season, enjoy.
but we didn't get you anything.
not to worry -- it's from the firm, actually.
not from me personally.
wait. Did you say punitive damages against us?
I'm afraid so, yes.
and to get all the bad news out of the way this afternoon, my retainer's gone.
so if you would like me to continue as your counsel,
I'll need another $25, 000 by the end of the week.
merry Christmas to you, Mr. Scrooge.
I thought he was my friend.
he's your friend, Brenda, but it's also what he does for a living.
Yeah, you mean making money off the troubles of innocent people?
what did he give us? What's in the box?
Oh, it's a silver tree ornament.
with the initials of their firm on it.
no, no, no, no.
don't throw it away. I want it.
in the spirit of the season.
here's a little Santa schematic, Chief.
zip line was installed yesterday at 5: 30 p. m.
four successful dry runs.
zip Xperience signed off on their equipment at 8: 30 p. m.
Yeah, the safety agreement has three signatures on it
Jack McBride, otherwise known as "Santa Jack,
his niece, Donna, who Julio's bringing up right now, and our victim, Randy Mann.
security guards were on duty last night until this morning at 10: 00 a. m. when the doors opened, leaving the trolley and the cable unattended.
full system failure -- a few seconds after noon.
giving us two hours when nearly anyone could have disabled the zip line's brakes.
great. Okay.
any other motive possible besides drug dealing?
Ah, yes.
it seems that our victim, Santa Randy, and his wife, Lisa, were recently qualified for a business loan.
Lisa has admitted that they were planning to open their own Christmas village.
another North Pole in L. A?
is that really such a big deal?
well, believe it or not, Chief, Santa Jack's village generates lots of cash.
after paying his taxes, rent to his niece, and alimony to a couple of Mrs. Clauses, - Santa brings home over $200, 000 per year. - Chief.
I have Santa's niece Donna in interview room 1.
okay, great. Maybe she can tell us where her Uncle's hiding.
Hey, Casey.
come on.
we're needed in electronics.
come on.
detective Sanchez! With me now, please.
ms. McBride, I'm Deputy Chief Johnson.
I am so sorry about the tragedy today at your Christmas village.
Oh, it's not my village.
dad left the property to me, but the village itself is my Uncle's.
technically, I'm his landlord.
he's supposed to pay a percentage of his receipts to me, but, more often than not, I just let him forget it.
I see. So, if you're not involved, why did you sign off as a witness on the safety agreement for the zip line?
well, as land owner, I still need to be careful about liability.
so you have nothing to do with managing the North Pole?
Oh, no.
no, I-I couldn't work with the people that Jack hires.
Randy Mann, with an arrest record like his...
so you guys knew that Randy was a drug dealer?
Oh, yes. Uncle Jack had to go bail him out once.
Randy never paid him back, of course.
and yet he sent him to Santa school?
this is gonna sound odd, but Uncle Jack thinks that playing Santa gives people an opportunity to...
redeem themselves, that to embody the Christmas spirit made one a better person.
for him, Santa's a spiritual thing.
jingle bells jingle bells
everybody!
jingle all the way!
sorry I'm late.
I was home a-wassailing.
come on. Let's get some Christmas going here.
Oh, my God. Your Christmas tree
it's completely naked.
people, you need to deck these halls, pronto.
eyes straight ahead.
you can't see anything here.
Hey, that's Donna. Why is Donna on TV?
all right, come on. Let's go. - No, I know her.
great. You know her. - Why is she on television?
let's go. - Please, I'm capable of guiding myself.
steady. - Ohh.
stay. Ohh.
Hello, everyone.
my apologies for appearing before you in dis
in this unseemly condition.
Santa is never publicly drunk in uniform.
it's a violation of my oath.
but I had no time to change into Santa casual before your extremely rude friend here dragged me from my humble abode.
Hello, young lady.
Santa Claus at your service.
and who would you be?
what? You don't know me? - Oh!
but I sat on your lap every Christmas for years.
I'm Casey Watson.
Oh, and who would you like to do when you grow up?
Hey!
well, I'm actually already doing it.
I'm a meteorologist at a weather station in Seattle.
a weather girl!
so you'll tell us all about what's it's like in santas all over the world.
what it's like in santas?
Yes, you know -- is it hot in Santa Barbara?
Santa Ana? Santa Monica?
cause it's plenty hot in here, Casey!
all right.
Oh, that voice.
what is she yammering on about now?
...Their own business loan and were looking to open their own Christmas village somewhere?
well, good luck in finding the undeveloped land anywhere near us.
Randy was gonna compete with my Uncle? That's horrible.
I-I can't believe I got so upset when he crashed into that chimney.
this will break Jack's heart.
so Santa Randy was trying to open up his own village?
you think Santa didn't know what was going on behind his back?
Santa has powers Randy never even dreamed of.
you think I changed places with him on the zip line because I was frightened?
Santa does not know fear.
well, then, Santa, tell us, why didn't you do the jump yourself?
Yeah. Why'd you change the batting order, Santa?
Santa's secret insights
I know when people have been bad.
so I went to Randy.
I said, "why don't you do the zip line?
go down the old chimbly?
no, no, no. Santa, just wait a minute, okay?
I paid him an extra $500.
Santa Claus cannot be taken by surprise.
Randy expected to replace me?!
Well...Not...Anymore.
Santa! Santa? Santa?
buzz, you want to give us a hand?
hold on. Hold on.
Oh, my gosh.
put him on Buzz's desk -- Buzz's desk.
Oh, he reeks. Geez! - Watch his arm. Watch his arm.
what happened to Santa?
get him on the desk. He passed out.
get him on the table. Oh, my God.
what's the matter, Lieutenant?
I never mirandized him.
why not? - You're kidding me.
what does that mean?
what that means is, we apparently have a Santa-on-Santa crime, but we can't use anything our suspect here said to prove it.
well, I don't know about that, Lieutenant.
buzz, did you get his statement on film?
Yes, ma'am. Unfortunately, I did.
well, I'll take a look at it.
it could be helpful, depending...
depending on what?
depending on how much you believe in Santa Claus.
sorry.
why are you guys still here?
well, Santa gave us the gift of overtime.
we had to serve a search warrant at his workshop, his house, and various storerooms.
in addition to some of the cheesiest decorations you've ever seen, we found all of his business records.
I thought he admitted everything.
Yeah.
well, uh, you know, there were some problems with his statement.
what kind of problems?
for one thing, he confessed before we got a chance to read him his rights.
Really? - Why do people do that?
did we smash his head in?
Oh, no, no, no.
that's, uh, from too much egg-nogging.
he passed out drunk in electronics.
great. That's yet another reason everything he said could be ruled inadmissible.
Oh. And he also implied that he was the real Santa Claus.
now, so we asked Buzz to try and sober him up so he wouldn't blurt anything else out that was incriminating.
the Chief would like a proper crack at him.
you're welcome.
Oh, uh, thank you, young man.
would you happen to have a cigarette?
no, and this is a nonsmoking area.
even for Santa? - Especially for Santa.
you're meant to come down the chimney, not smoke like one.
well, then, would you pull a trash can over here, please?
you know, when I was a kid, I looked forward to talking to you for months.
you were the symbol of my very favorite time of the year.
and now I-I feel you've ruined every Christmas memory that I have.
Plus, you don't even recognize me.
that's not true.
I recall you very well
a very caring young boy with a happy smile.
why, I might even be the reason why you work with the police now.
one year, you sat on my knee, you looked Santa in the eye, and you asked... for a camera.
I never asked you for a camera.
Oh, well. Sometimes I get lucky.
God.
well, that should sober him up a little bit.
sorry. These things occasionally happen to Santa.
Really?
by the way, does he have a motive?
two, actually, sir.
not only was the victim about to compete with him, but, uh, Santa Jack has probably...
Santa Jack? - Yes, sir.
Santa Jack has probably the best business insurance policy I've ever seen in my life.
being that he has a seasonal operation, if he's shut down for any reason at all, he's guaranteed the previous year's income.
policy was hard to find, sir.
his financial papers were a mess.
about the only thing he did file properly...
...Were the letters and cards he got from kids over the years.
right.
So...Why are we all standing here?
Oh. Excuse me.
sorry. I need to get through.
please, allow me.
Hey. You can go through. - Thank you.
Yes, sirree.
who is that?
that is Buzz's sister Casey.
she does the weather in Seattle.
she's hot, sir.
but she has opinions.
Oh. - Oh, my.
Santa vomit -- how charming.
tell me, Buzzy, still believe this guy represents the magic of Christmas?
now, hold on a minute, young lady.
I'll admit that my behavior the last few hours has been disgraceful.
but I want you to know that, before this evening,
I spent my entire adult life respecting Christmas.
and in case you've forgotten -- where is she?
and in case you've forgotten,
I also stand for peace on earth and joy to the world.
behold -- even in my darkest hour, the power of Santa Claus draws these jaded police officers to gaze on me in wonder and awe.
they know what I represent is real.
they certainly look real.
maybe I should show them around.
I mean Buzz and his sister, while she's in town.
Yeah, right. - Oh.
you know, as chief of police, I can take her places nobody else can.
would y'all look at yourselves?
like a bunch of diabetics standing in front of a candy store.
did Santa wake up from his long winter's nap, so we can all get back to work?
really, guys, can we please?
we have important work to do here.
come on.
okay, Santa. Time to get up.
let's go.
Hi, Casey. Hi.
well, merry Christmas to both of you.
and thank you, young lady, for your healing attentions.
Oh. Oh, sorry.
probably lint from my beard. My fault.
let's go. Come on.
you have the right to remain silent.
all right.
if you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I hate you bother you with this, but, um...
you have the right to an attorney. - Yes.
if you can't afford one, one will be appointed to you.
Gavin is asking for another $25, 000, and I don't have it.
he's still charging you? All right.
don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.
thank you, Will.
thank you so much.
okay, Chief.
Santa Jack, when we spoke earlier today, you said that you gave up your trip on the zip line because it frightened you.
and I keep thinking how lucky it is that the person who replaced you was the same guy trying to open his own Christmas village.
but he was also the only other qualified Santa at the North Pole.
and now that I'm sober, I really feel bad about that accident.
well, you know, it's funny that you use the word "accident..."
...'Cause we found evidence that suggests that someone tampered with the brakes on that zip line.
making it look less like an accident and more like a murder.
murder?! Ohh!
but...you can't think Santa did this!
earlier this evening, you implied
Oh, no, no, wait.
that -- that was the eggnog talking.
listen, if I wanted Randy dead, I wouldn't have offed him in front of a bunch of innocent little children.
this has ruined my business.
no, actually, it hasn't.
you're about to make out like a bandit.
what's that?
excuse me, sir. - Oh.
that's your business insurance policy.
thank you, Detective.
it covers all revenues losses from the closure of the North Pole Village.
you could actually make more money closed than if you'd stayed open.
hope I'm not crowding you, Casey. - Mm.
Casey, right? - Mm-hmm.
chief of Police William Pope.
Hi. - Nice to meet you.
my brother must have set this up for me as part of the lease agreement when he bought me the village.
keeping a close eye on this case. - Mm.
a lot of frantic parents calling in.
I'm hoping we can keep from spoiling Santa Claus for a lot of little children.
that's wonderful.
you're helping parents delay the moment children realize they've been lied to about Christmas their whole lives.
that must make you very proud.
listen, uh, do you happen to know how much, uh, how much, uh, Santa Jack gets paid for having to shut down like this?
this year, approximately $600, 000.
holy frankincense And myrrh!
Hey, does it also cover what happened to my float, too?
wait. What happened to your float?
Oh, it went up in flames.
Oh, burnt completely.
I-I barely got out of the storage garage alive.
you were with the float when it caught on fire?
well, yeah.
truth is, I-I get a lot of attention now, but the rest of the year,
I'm mostly just another out-of-work actor in Hollywood.
and sometimes when I'm feeling a little blue,
I-I dress up in my old Santa suit and go hang out in my float, maybe have a drink or two.
anyway, last September, I passed out on my sleigh bench, and when I woke up, the entire float was in flames.
Yeah, and my, uh... My best beard, the one made entirely of actual yak hair -- torched!
burned up faster than a pair of kid's pajamas.
Oh, my God.
the Halloween fair's even paid for, even though the health department shut me down.
because of botulism.
Yeah, in one single brownie, and it was brownie, to boot.
little guy snatched it right off the platter of snacks that Randy and I kept in my big Jack-o'-lantern.
that was my name at Halloween
Jack Lantern.
funny, right?
didn't something happen to your minivan, too?
Yeah.
my brakes went out just as I was getting off the freeway.
luckily, the light was green at the bottom of the exit ramp.
otherwise, Santa would have crashed and
so, wait. Wait. Wait.
today, the zip line. Yeah.
before that, the minivan.
and the brownie and the float.
my God!
is this part of the war on Christmas?
either that, or today someone killed the wrong Santa.
Fritzi? Hey.
you're up late.
Yeah. Yeah.
something about possibly losing everything we have made it hard to nod off, so I thought I'd get Christmas up and rolling.
how'd your day go?
good. Good. - Mm.
I'm sta-- oh, Keith!
I'm starting to think that somebody really doesn't want Santa at the North Pole.
and his niece was right.
we've been checking with realtors, and Randy and Lisa couldn't afford a vacant lot in Los Angeles, much less their own Christmas village.
Hey, Fritzi, what are you doing?
I am taking down all of your Phillip Stroh stuff.
what? Why? - I am. I am tired of looking at him.
it is creepy, having him in our guest room all the time. But the case is still open.
and I'm the only person who still remembers what happened to all these poor women. Hey, look, I live here, too.
and I've got to get this guy out of our guest room.
it's not good for me, so one of us has to go.
okay. Fine. I'll -- I'll take him to work.
that's not a big deal at all.
Hey, look, look, look.
I know what Stroh did was awful.
but holding on to the past like this, refusing to let go of the guy -- it's hurting us, too.
it's making this court case we're facing more credible.
don't you want to beat this thing?
is getting Stroh worth risking our whole future?
you're right. I'm sorry.
sorry. I know you're right.
sometimes, I hold on to things longer than I should.
but, look, you have to know that there's nothing on earth I want more than to get rid of Gavin and Goldman and this whole terrible lawsuit...
so that the future can go back to what it used to be.
I'd be happy if our guest room goes back to what it used to be.
look, the future is gonna be what it is.
in the meantime, try not to freak out in advance.
what?
how true.
freaking out in advance
that's -- that's just not right.
Casey, don't mess with my camera.
come on, Buzzy.
you're supposed to be Mr. Holiday Spirit.
mom said she wanted pictures of you, too.
okay, uh, let's fast-forward to the accident, please.
...6...5... Okay, Casey, smile.
...4...3...2...1! No! Oh, God! No!
okay, stop it right there.
L-let's go back to where the woman screams.
...4...3...2...1! No! Oh, my God! No!
freeze it. There.
you know, when Buzz first showed me this footage, it didn't quite register that the woman started screaming before Santa Randy took the leap.
and as you can see, Ms. McBride, that woman is...You.
Donna McBride, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you...
wait a minute. I don't understand what's happening.
why are you, uh...
your niece was horrified in advance of the accident.
which means, Santa Jack, that she knew Randy was about to take the death plunge that she had planned for you.
no. No, that's not right.
I-I could never kill my Uncle Jack.
you're probably right, but not for lack of trying.
and who else has access to his property, could burn down the place where he stores his float, or fiddle with his brakes?
but she doesn't know anything about zip lines.
well, she knew everything she needed to know after signing off on the safety agreement, including how the brakes work.
and she saw you rehearsing the ride.
this is nonsense.
why would I do such a terrible thing?
I remember you telling me that Randy and Lisa couldn't afford to buy the North Pole.
made me wonder just how much a plot of land like that would cost in L. A.
so we did some research.
two days before your Uncle's car accident, the real-estate company of Brown&Barrows offered you $20 million for the property that you're leasing to your Uncle for life.
and, lo and behold, two days later, his minivan crashes.
one week later, Brown&Barrows upped their offer by $1 million.
and your Uncle barely escaped burning to death on his float.
there's a pattern.
offer. Botulism.
offer. Zip line.
listen to me, Donna. This is what I'm going to do.
I'm going to arrest you for murder in the first degree and three counts of attempted santacide.
but in the spirit of the season, and since you weren't really trying to kill Santa Randy,
I'm not going to pursue the death-penalty trial if you just say the magic words.
I offered you a million dollars to give up that lease.
Christmas...is not for sale.
you idiot!
what? I am not an idiot.
you didn't to dress up in that stupid red suit and wave at people. It is not a stupid red suit!
you are not a legend!
there are hundreds of santas better than you!
you are the worst actor ever -- ever!
young lady, I'll have you know I've won six drama-logue awards!
Oh, God!
he is a degenerate undeserving blowhard who ruined every Christmas for me my entire life!
because of him, I never even got the chance to believe in Santa Claus!
Yeah, I wanted him dead.
and if I ever get the chance, I'll try and kill him again!
well, merry Christmas to you, too.
another $25, 000? Are you serious?
I know it's been a while since you worked in the city attorney's office, but do you recall what a public servant like Chief Johnson is paid?
I recall it very well.
that's why I left and got into private practice, where, lest we forget, people pay me for my services.
so far, I've saved the city over $500, 000.
and if I'm fending off a $50 million award, plus punitive damages against Chief Johnson, in what can only be described as the biggest lawsuit of its kind currently before the federal bench, my compensation should be relative to my expenses and my time involved.
all right, listen, if you are trying the biggest lawsuit of its kind currently before the federal bench, then you're gonna be on television a lot and
well, my public profile is part -- - I'm still talking.
I'm still talking.
all right, look, you could not buy the kind of publicity that you will get from this case.
from now on, you will be the first resort of any law-enforcement officer facing similar charges, and I'm guessing your rates will go up accordingly.
to be clear, if you are not willing to take this pro bono,
I guarantee you somebody else will be.
if want to set up your next competitor, be our guest.
well, let's not draw this out.
I don't usually work for free, but I like Brenda, and I hate Peter Goldman, and my office will be in touch.
Bye-bye.
Oh, will...
thank you so much for helping me again.
there's no way we could afford to pay for that.
excuse me.
I couldn't help but overhear
c-correct me if I'm wrong, but are you under the impression that Chief Pope was in any way responsible for procuring me my last retainer?
well, I know the city didn't volunteer to pay it.
you're right.
and Chief Pope had nothing to do with it, either.
he didn't? - No.
that money came from your husband, out of an inheritance he had from his parents.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Ah, yes, I remember.
Bye-bye.
I know you thought he was a sham, but look at this.
here's all the stuff Santa Jack saved from kids over the years
thousands and thousands of letters filed alphabetically and by date.
one in particular stands out to me.
dear Santa...
I am writing you "because we have had a very hard time since we lost my dad.
and someone stole my big brother Buzzy's bicycle, "and mom says we can't buy a new one.
all of his friends have bikes, and he feels left out, "even though he acts like it's okay.
we still live in the same place we did last year.
and if there's anything left over after the bike, "I would like a pony.
I love you, Santa.
you see?
can anyone here say "hallelujah!" 20 million times really fast?
cause that's how grateful I am for the $20 million
Brown&Barrows has just agreed to pay me for my Christmas village!
I thought you said you'd never give up the North Pole.
well, that's before you guys proved that my niece tried to kill me.
now she needs a lawyer.
so I told her, if she signed the land over to me, I'd sell it and help her hire one.
here, here. Enjoy.
Oh. The reason for the season.
don't think I forgot about you, young fella.
if it wasn't for that trusty camera of yours,
Donna would be planning on murdering me again, I'm sure.
so, tell us, Santa, what are they gonna build at the North Pole?
what they always build in L. A.
a temperature-controlled indoor shopping environment, featuring lots of retail stores all crammed next to each other and connected by an escalator and a food court.
happy holidays!
I can't believe you sold Christmas.
Oh, nonsense, Buzz.
what says Christmas better than a mall?
my very words, ye merry gentlemen
my very words.
and Santa remembers you, too, lovely lady.
Oh. Sorry.
a little confetti there. My fault.
and don't forget, boys and girls, to tune in on Christmas Eve, when we will be plugging in our specially modified doppler 12000 radar to track Santa's progress as he makes his journey all the way from the North Pole and into your living room and under your tree.
I'm Casey Watson.
good weather, and good night.
and we're out.
Shaw looks pissed
like he got stood up or something.
I find nothing connecting Shaw to this address.
I'll mark it down. FBI INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SEARCH: 1919 N. KINGSLEY ST. LOS ANGELES
now what?
here. Look.
you know this guy?
no, but Shaw does.
Hey. Hey, what was that?
Oh! That's not good. Not good.
come on, Morris. We got to stop this.
he's gonna kill this guy.
you know he's -- just wait.
you want to explain to the U.S. attorney how we sat here and filmed a guy getting beaten to death instead of saving his life?
all right. Come on, damn it.
wait, wait, wait, wait. They're stopping.
Oh. Fight's over.
the guy Shaw beat up needs an ambulance. I'm calling 911.
911. What's your emergency? - Yeah, this is Agent Burns, FBI.
I need L.A.P.D. to respond to 1919 North Kingsley Street.
tell them we need the identity of the victim and tell them to get here quick before he drives away.
Yeah, it's a dark-blue pickup parked in the driveway. - Hey, Shaw's on the move.
God damn! Shaw's on the move! - Driver needs medical assistance.
l. A.P. D. needs to get us an I.D. ASAP.
let's go, Burns! Start the vehicle! Let's go!
Yeah, he's alive. He's alive.
he's beat to hell, but he's alive.
we're losing Shaw! Come on!
Where's Chief Johnson?
uh, her parents dropped in for a quick visit, so we've decided to leave her out of this for now.
what did the FBI say happened here?
well, the guy I spoke to, an Agent Morris, said there was some kind of fistfight.
but when they left, the victim was still alive.
well, if it makes you feel any better, the Feds are telling the truth about the fight.
the blood trail stretches about 10 feet this way, but I'm pretty sure it's the gunshots in his head that killed him.
two, up close.
so here's the timeline.
FBI dials 911 at 7: 32 p. m.
right?
officers are dispatched, arrive at 7: 37 p. m.
victim is D.O.A.
so we're expected to believe this murder happened in the five minutes between the FBI leaving and our officers responding?
what the hell kind of operation is the FBI running that they let this guy get killed?
surveillance, Provenza.
they just wanted his name.
registration and plates say he's a Paul Burke of Santa Monica, sir.
all right.
let me call the FBI.
no, no, no. Just hold on, commander.
hold on.
I-I don't want to give the FBI this name unless we get what we need in return.
like the name of the guy they had under surveillance when he killed our victim.
A.K.A. our main suspect.
they'll never give us that, Andy.
well, not with that attitude.
our boy, Jimmy, says he's gonna stay up in Manhattan for Christmas.
says he and his roommate, that Frank, have other plans for the holidays.
I'd think he'd seen enough of Frank.
I mean, they share that tiny, little apartment, both of them splitting one bedroom.
I-I just couldn't do that.
now, Clay Jr. -- he's working so much that he's probably gonna spend Christmas in his office.
well, you know, you and Willie Ray are always welcome to spend the holidays with us if you are willing.
and don't get me started on Bobby!
I'm not running down my kids.
don't you get that idea at all.
but not one of them can break away to meet us for Christmas.
that's just mind-boggling.
Hello?
uh, sorry to bother you, Chief.
I need to speak to your husband for a minute.
Why? What's going on?
Oh, you know, nothing.
um, just looking for some background info.
wow, this was up-close and personal.
a lot of sooting. - Sooting?
lieutenant, I-is that Kendall?
uh, Chief, I-I-I need you to put Special Agent Howard on the phone, please.
let's move the body.
body?! Lieutenant!
did he hang up on me?
Where's my cell?
Hello?
Yes, Lieutenant Provenza.
I have a victim under surveillance.
uh, is that -- why
give me the phone.
the word is "please." Please give me the phone.
Yeah, Lieutenant, go on.
I need to ask you about an Agent Morris who's dealing with it.
Yes, Lieutenant, we have several surveillance situations going on right now.
could you give me a few more details?
the Chief.
chief Johnson - Are you there, Lieutenant?
Hello? - Uh, yeah, this Agent Morris admits to witnessing most of what happened to our victim, whose name the FBI wants, and I can give you that, but in return, I want the name of the guy that Morris had under surveillance.
uh, now, if he turns out not to be the shooter, he could be the last person to see our victim alive.
will no one pick up their phone?
so, you, uh, you want to trade info.
that's right.
the identity of our dead guy for the name of your suspect.
okay, Lieutenant.
let's do it. You first.
Ah. Yes.
uh, well, the victim is Paul Burke from Santa Monica.
worked for the Laura B Catering company.
catering. Very interesting.
I will get back to you with the name you wanted shortly.
hello. No, uh... Agent Howard.
he'll... He'll get back to me...
shortly, he said.
not me.
uh, Lieutenant, it's
this is ridiculous!
I've never been treated like this before in my life. - It's not ridiculous -- it's a federal issue and not your business at the moment.
Willie Ray, I'm so sorry.
I hate to leave.
but this is something that just can't wait.
Oh, we understand.
crime doesn't stop for dinner in this house.
matter of fact, it pays for dinner.
you go man those barricades, son.
I just want to tell you. How very proud we are of you.
T-thank you, Clay.
how very proud.
thank -- thanks very much.
honey - Thank you.
he has to go.
if you're meeting my division, I'm going, too.
no, no, no, no, no.
this is classified FBI business. Top secret.
top secret? L-like the way you paid Gavin and didn't tell me -- that kind of top secret?
Oh. Yeah, that was horribly selfish of me, using my inheritance for your legal fees.
the things I hide!
look, if you're really interested in uncovering some secrets, why don't you find out the reason behind your parents' blitz visit and why your mother is so quiet or that hug your dad just gave me?
what was that about?
say goodbye to Fritzi and bring in the rest of the dinner.
anyway, I don't know how to break this to you, but you are gonna have to spend some time alone with your parents.
I love you. I'll be back as soon as I can.
Bye!
tell her right now when there's no distraction. Shh.
well, I guess it's just us for dinner, then.
which might make it easier to say what it is you flew out here to tell me.
which is obviously too serious to talk about on the phone.
well, why don't we just have a nice dinner with each other, and then when Fritzi comes back
enough, Willie Ray.
enough.
let's just get it out there.
Clay...not right before we eat.
there's never going to be a good time!
damn it!
doctor said don't take away my control!
doctor?
what kind of doctor, daddy?
well...I've heard you police people say, "I've got some good news and some bad news."
well, so do I.
good news is I'm not gonna die.
bad news is, well...I've got cancer.
there it is.
Hey.
that's terrible news about your dad.
how's he feeling this morning?
I don't know.
let's -- let's talk about it later. Okay.
everyone, this is Special Agent Morris.
he's one of the guys who filmed the confrontation between our victim in the pickup, Paul Burke, and the other guy.
who we should call "the assailant"?
the name of our surveillance subject is Eric Shaw.
detective Sanchez, yes.
I want to thank Agent Morris for filming the murder for us.
there's no murder on that tape, Detective.
we would have heard the two gunshots before we left.
you know, I appreciate you getting Eric Shaw's name back to me in such a timely manner, but you'll forgive me if we all feel that there may be some strings attached.
not strings -- chains.
Eric Shaw is the linchpin in an investigation involving interstate trafficking of stolen property.
Oh, whoopty-do.
through work by our field officers in Miami and New York, we've just succeeded in tracing millions of dollars in furniture, art, and electronics to burglaries here in Los Angeles, and to Eric Shaw through pawn shops he operates in Florida and auction houses in Manhattan he deals with.
we've had him under constant surveillance now for the last three days, hoping to discover the details of his operation.
we think your victim provided us with the key.
paul Burke and Eric Shaw were partners in a catering company we now think was used to case expensive homes in the Hollywood Hills.
the blue dots represent homes burglarized in the last year in L.A.
these yellow diamonds show homes where Burke's company met about a job.
so, Shaw catered every residence that he robbed, and you guys just now put that together?
no, bright eyes.
even you L.A.P.D. mutts could have figured that out.
Mutts?
Hey, hey, Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Lieutenant.
they didn't cater any of these homes. All right?
once they got a good look at the houses, they would intentionally overbid the job.
that way, another company would come in and work the party, and Burke and Shaw would come back later and burglarize the house.
so the catering connection was completely hidden.
Yes. Yes.
but we are confident that if we can exploit this lead, we can close our case and we can roll up Shaw's entire organization.
well, what about our murder?
we want the L.A.P.D. to feel free to pursue that as long as they don't disrupt our surveillance of Shaw.
but Shaw is our suspect.
no, he's not.
we just showed you video proving Shaw didn't murder anybody.
so where's the video of Shaw for the rest of the evening? Or before?
why don't you show us that?!
wait -- wait a minute.
um, did we make our notifications?
Yeah. Uh, Chief, late last night, we talked to Burke's wife and son.
and we should follow up there because the victim had just told his wife he wanted a divorce.
the Burkes are on their way in right now, Chief.
there. People you can talk to.
and divorce
that's a great motive for murder.
so, other suspects.
just don't mention the name Eric Shaw or anything about a theft ring.
understood?
well, that sounds quite a bit more like a command than an ask, Agent Morris, and allow me to point out that most of these burglaries and certainly this murder took place in the city of Los Angeles, where I happen to be Chief of Police.
we get to set the priorities on this one.
we're talking about clearing almost 40 of your open cases, Will.
that's a win-win for everyone.
let's interview the family first, see what they have to say.
we'd do that anyway.
thank you so much for the briefing, Agent Morris.
excuse me.
do you work for me or for your husband?
honestly, Will, I don't know if I can work at all right now.
okay. Look, if -- if you're feeling more stressed out about this federal lawsuit...
no, it's not that.
it's my -- it's my father. He's really sick.
he just told me last night.
Oh, God, Brenda.
I'm s-- I'm so sorry.
I-I think maybe I should go home for Christmas, Will.
I know it's not scheduled, but...
no, that's...
what -- what exactly is wrong with your dad?
thyroid cancer.
I looked it all up last night online.
daddy's gonna suffer from high blood pressure, exhaustion, mood swings.
he practically bit my mother's head off last night.
you know...
it...it might be easier on your mom and dad than you think.
why do you say that?
because they're here now, handing out gifts.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
is that a snowman wearing a policeman's uniform?
it is!
and when Clay and I saw it, we just knew you should have it.
well, thank you.
how great.
Hey.
you should be home, resting.
we're only gonna be here two more days.
we want to make the most of it.
spreading a little holiday cheer never hurt anybody.
uh, excuse me, Chief.
Oh, Detective Sanchez!
the last little boy on Santa's route.
we knew that you probably have a lot of these at home, but these are for work.
Oh! Wonderful!
chief, the victim's family's here, and
Oh, uh, one second, Detective.
look, daddy, I think I should drive y'all home.
Oh, Brenda Leigh, when have I ever wanted you to make a big fuss over me?
if you don't do your job, it'll make me feel worse.
now, you go on. Go on, now.
we're among friends. - Okay.
uh, Detective Sanchez, you can bring the family in.
I can't. - Why not?
you'll see.
excuse me.
is that...
Yes, ma'am, Eric Shaw.
what on earth is he doing here?
his sister, Laura, was our victim's wife.
paul Burke was Eric Shaw's brother-in-law, and you didn't know it?
look, we only very recently connected Shaw to these robberies.
I thought you had him under constant surveillance.
how is it he's just showing up in my break room without you knowing it?
these investigations are complex. We don't
you lost him last night, didn't you?
Oh, my God.
so how do you know that Shaw didn't just circle the block and then come back and shoot my victim?
Oh, there's no proof of that.
well, I'll give him proof when I show him that video...
no, no, no, Brenda! - That you made last night.
if Shaw knows we're onto him, we'd lose our chance to take down the rest of his ring.
we want everyone. You cannot question him.
so what do you want me to do?
talk to everyone else in the victim's family and completely ignore Shaw -- is that it?
don't you think he'll notice?
all right, look.
I know exactly how we'll handle this.
sorry, Chief. Just, uh, clearing the table for you.
thank you so much.
detective Gabriel.
uh, Deputy Chief Johnson, this is Mr. Burke's wife, Laura, and their son, Ian.
and this is Laura's brother and sister, Eric and Emily Shaw.
and this is...
I'm Fritz Howard, and I'm so sorry for your loss.
he'll be taking notes.
and I want to apologize, Mrs. Burke, for asking you and your son to come down here so soon after a tragedy like this, but we do have some formal questions for you.
what kind of formal questions are you talking about?
my sister's in shock.
she shouldn't even be here right now.
Eric, Eric, it's fine.
I-I want to help.
please.
okay.
well, we need to start with asking each of you where you were last night between 6: 00 p. m. and 9: 00 p. m.
um, I was at home with Ian, and I made dinner, and we talked for a long time.
about?
I was thinking I should take some time off from college.
mom didn't want me to.
and, "Emily," is it?
Yeah.
I was, um, at my apartment watching a Christmas movie.
and I was with her.
which movie was that?
it's a Wonderful Life.
Yeah, right.
more like "Fight Club."
Hey, Morris. Here's a little tip.
when following someone, wherever they go, you go.
Mrs. Burke, do you have any idea what your husband was doing in Hollywood last night?
no.
all of our friends live on the West Side.
any catering jobs? - No.
we -- we don't have any clients in that area right now.
do we, Eric? Emily? - No.
Oh, are all of you in the catering business together?
but not working in that area and not last night.
so...
so, it was strange your husband being there?
dad did a lot of strange things lately.
in what way?
how about coming home last week and telling my mother he's not in love with her anymore?
and their marriage is over...
because he just decided it was.
and telling me it's none of my business.
is that strange enough for you?
cause it's pretty strange to me.- Ian, Ian.
your dad was a good man.
Laura, you don't know the whole story.
no. No. Don't air it here. - What? What story? What?
Emily, what are you talking about?
I'm sorry you got to find out like this.
but Paul was where they found him last night because he was sleeping with Claudia.
your ex-girlfriend?
she -- she works for us!
Yeah.
you found him in Hollywood last night because he was leaving her apartment.
Oh, my God!
we need to find this Claudia Shipley.
are you -- are you sure, Eric?
Yes, I'm sure.
I found out when she texted me by mistake, thinking I was Paul.
Oh, so both of you were sleeping with this Claudia Shipley?
did you not hear the part about her being my ex?!
paul was cheating on my little sister. STOP
that's what bothered me.
and did you confront him about this?
we ask about a confrontation, Mr. Shaw, because we assume that you know where your ex-girlfriend lived.
and there were signs of a struggle in the driveway outside her apartment building. STOP NOW
well, it looks like Paul was pissing off more people than just us.
I don't know what gets into men after they turn 40.
I really don't. - I don't believe it.
paul was not seeing Claudia.
Yeah, Laura. He was.
Mr. Shaw, I need to ask you -- - Mrs. Burke, Ian...
your family has been through a terrible ordeal, and I can assure you that Chief Johnson and the L.A.P D. are gonna work tirelessly to conclude this investigation.
in the meantime, I don't think we need to take up any more of your time this morning.
I want to thank you for coming in.
and again, we're very, very sorry for your loss.
detective?
thank you.
thank you.
thank you so much.
sorry I'm late.
big pile-up on the 405, been backed up with traffic fatalities all morning.
you all right?
you seem a little down, and you haven't interrupted me yet.
uh, I-I was just wondering do you know how serious thyroid cancer can be?
by the time I usually find it in someone, it's extremely serious. Why?
my father has it.
Oh. No. What stage?
first. First.
Oh. Don't worry.
thyroidectomy.
it's a very simple surgery.
very simple.
and post-op, he'll just have to find a balance.
when you say "simple surgery," how simple is it, really?
like this. See? - Ohh...Here's the victim's thyroid.
I grabbed it while we were talking.
it's that easy.
of course, your father will have to be anesthetized, and they shouldn't cut through his neck like that, but still...
doctor, you didn't have to do that.
Oh, don't worry. This guy won't miss it.
thyroid that's Greek for "shield."
looks like a little shield, doesn't it?
and they guard us, too, thyroids.
they keep us from having emotional breakdowns and crippling mood swings.
just think of it as a regulator for your inner diva.
so that's it?
just a quick little surgery and the person recovers?
well, not this guy, but generally, yes.
recover.
now, your father will have to watch his calcium levels for the rest of his life.
his emotions will be all over the place.
but I'm sure he'll find a balance.
I can tell you this much.
the procedure usually works out better than getting shot twice in the head.
and beaten up, too.
your victim had a very bad night.
there's a lot of sooting at the wounds, so the weapon was discharged at close range.
hmm, but what's really interesting is the mark on the scalp.
see this bruising around the bullet holes?
it's kind of like a little tattoo of the murder weapon.
a small double-barreled gun.
but what kind, I wonder?
a . 41-caliber derringer, Chief.
okay, well, if you ask me, that makes for a pretty rarified murder weapon.
lieutenant Flynn, would you please look into reports on missing derringers and sales of bullets that went with it?
Yeah, I'll check some pawn shops, too.
you never know.
chief?
got Claudia Shipley in interview 2.
Oh, good.
and, uh...Oh.
do you really need to sit next to me and pass notes like we're in homeroom?
what do you care about this woman?
she was Shaw's ex-girlfriend.
after which she was dating my victim.
what does Claudia Shipley have to do with your investigation?
uh, Chief?
when we picked Claudia up, she was at the airport on her way to Brazil with $1. 8 million in her carry-on.
that sounds a little suspicious.
look, we are working a murder here, not a bunch of burglaries.
and if Claudia Shipley really is the killer, which is probably the case, and she's fleeing with huge wads of cash, then you should thank me for finding her so the FBI won't look like the worst cops on earth for having lost Shaw to begin with.
I think you're getting a little more angry than the circumstances warrant.
and we both know why.
your parents need a little more attention than the L.A.P.D. does this afternoon.
let me interview Claudia.
take this opportunity to spend some more time with your mom and dad.
I cannot...
believe...
that you would use my father's cancer to manipulate me into giving up this interview.
I cannot believe it!
it is awful, just shameful.
shameful.
that really should have worked.
you'd think!
she's good. Very good.
good afternoon, Ms. Shipley.
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.
I'm so sorry to have interrupted your trip to Brazil.
but we have some questions about an incident that happened outside of your apartment building.
did you happen to see or hear anything unusual last night, early evening, around 7: 30?
well, yes, I heard there was a murder.
did you know the victim?
I don't think so.
uh, I wasn't there when it happened.
so, Claudia, you're completely unaware of the fact that the victim last night was your boss from the catering company, Paul Burke?
what?
Oh, my God. No, you're kidding. Why?
what was Mr. Burke doing at my apartment building?
we were wondering the same thing.
do you and Mr. Burke see each other outside of work?
no. God, he was married.
Claudia, we have the victim's cellphone, and it's full of text messages from you.
so where were you last night between 6: 00 p.m. and 9: 00 p.m?
I was on a film set with a lot of other background artists.
I was doing a movie.
Oh. You're an actor.
I thought you were a waiter for a catering company.
I do both.
working two jobs
that explains the $1. 8 million that you were taking on your spontaneous trip to Brazil.
all right.
all right.
I knew Paul had been murdered, and I was scared.
Why? - 'Cause of that money.
paul was keeping it at my apartment.
and now Paul was dead.
so I thought someone might kill me to take it.
well, Claudia, you should know that we are getting ready to search your apartment - right this minute. - Wait.
you're gonna search my place?
Yes, we are!
okay.
are you the person that can make deals?
sure.
I can make a deal.
the reason that I bring this up is, when you're searching my apartment, you might find some furniture, um, some art things... silver, maybe, that might be...I don't know, stolen property.
but you need to know that I did not take any of those things.
but no gun? - No! Are you kidding?
I hate guns!
so how did all this stolen property make it into your apartment
miss Shipley?
I'm Special Agent Howard of the FBI.
this is Special Agent Morris.
I think you should know in advance that Deputy Chief Johnson's deals
almost always include a lot of prison time.
and those made by the FBI involve something called the Witness Protection program.
now, I think, honestly, you would be better off coming with us.
you'd really send me to prison?
Yeah. Probably.
you know, guys, you're welcome.
I'm glad we could find someone to help you wrap up your case.
funny, I-I don't remember saying thank you.
Hey, Chief.
it's not all bad. - It isn't?
homeless guy was arrested with this this morning.
scared the crap out of some drivers when he was panhandling with it.
more effective than a squeegee. Here. Let me see that.
he's still in booking.
he said he found it near the LA Brea off-ramp of the 10.
here. Take a look at this. See? See?
lines up. Huh? Perfect fit.
now, look at this.
matches the wound and the bruising.
this derringer was stolen from this house in the Hollywood Hills, which happens to be one of the houses that the gang burglarized.
now, there are no prints on the gun. But that ties it to Shaw.
we need to do more than just tie it to him, Lieutenant.
we need to put it in his hand.
I'm not quite sure how to do that yet.
you think we should share this information with the FBI?
Oh, sure.
just as soon as we figure out how to use it.
so, did Claudia Shipley say anything about the murder?
you know I can't reveal what Claudia told me.
my interview with her landed you a major piece of information that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
thank you, mama.
she served her purpose. That's all I can say.
you mean she served your purpose.
so, what, you found lots and lots of stolen goods at her apartment, and some of them came from Shaw, is that it?
is it too much to ask that we finish our dessert before you two start yammering about a murder?!
clay, don't do this to yourself.
you're tired.
you need to finish your pie and go to bed.
do not tell me what to do!
I do not need
but, daddy, mama was just saying that you were tired.
and don't you interrupt me, Brenda Leigh!
I mean it, now.
if I am tired, it's because I'm tired of people telling me I'm tired, especially you, Willie Ray.
I am bone-weary of the word "tired"!
now, y'all can go back to ignoring me because now I am going to bed.
what was that all about?
well, now you know what I've been dealing with.
is he like that every day, Willie Ray?
no, no. And don't worry about it.
you have your own lives to deal with.
mama, this is too much for you to manage on your own.
look, I have vacation days all stored up, and -- and I'll come out to Atlanta to visit you just as soon as you want me to.
well, your father and I would love that, Brenda Leigh.
but it's not necessary, really.
we have the surgery the first of the year.
then Clay has hormone-replacement therapy, and that takes a few weeks to get right.
so I'm thinking that after the surgery would be the best time, if you want to.
we do. We do.
well, I can book the tickets for the second week in January.
if you can.
that would be a wonderful treat.
having more of the family together might help your father recover faster.
the truth is, Clay thinks that he has completely dealt with this diagnosis, and he hasn't.
I have to help him understand that he hasn't dealt with it.
I tell you -- this pie is delicious.
y'all ought to try a bite.
now, I'm gonna go in and give Clay a pep talk.
I'll be right back.
what are you thinking?
that some families are easier to bring together than others.
a Wisconsin man vacationing here in Los Angeles reported seeing a gun being thrown from a vehicle along the 10 freeway just after the murder.
unfortunately, the driver was lost at the time and not sure where along the freeway he saw the weapon get dumped.
and as you know, it's a long stretch of road.
so, what we're gonna do is we're gonna detail 10 patrol officers to find this gun.
we'll start here, check some of the freeway interchanges, and stop at the exit nearest the apartment.
takes about two weeks.
because it's a small weapon and it won't be easy to find.
we owe it to all of you to look for it just as hard as we can.
will that solve the case?
I don't care anymore. I don't want to be involved.
this is...
it's not what I wanted my life to be about.
excuse me.
well, sit down. Sit down, Ian.
sit down.
Laura will want to know about this later.
and so will you.
go on, Detective.
well, if, when we can locate the weapon we can connect it to an individual...
I thought we already found the gun.
we did.
now we're just encouraging someone else to go hunt for it.
we found a ton of stolen goods in her apartment, and if Claudia turns up, we're hoping she'll be able to help us sort things out.
you looking for this?
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you by the state.
do you understand these rights, Emily?
Yeah.
this is all a big misunderstanding.
no, it's not. I understand perfectly.
you came back here to recover a murder weapon.
I didn't kill anyone.
all right, then. You tossed it for someone else.
let's see, um, your sister, Laura.
her husband asked for a divorce.
she finds him in Claudia's apartment and snaps.
how about your nephew?
was the pain of watching his father leave his mother too much to bear?
okay, leave them out of this.
or maybe it was your brother, Eric.
paul was divorcing his sister and sleeping with his ex-girlfriend.
no. No.
the gun's mine.
Eric gave it to me.
you sure about that?
Yeah. Me...My brother -- we're the black sheep.
we always have been.
that's why when Eric got Claudia's text by mistake, I knew -- I knew he was gonna lose it with Paul.
so I followed him.
and you watched him beat up Paul?
Yeah.
Yeah, I was gonna jump out and stop him if he went too far.
but he didn't.
and then, after Eric left, I -- I even went to check on the asshole.
didn't want Paul to bleed to death or anything, especially not before he told us where he'd taken all the money we trusted him to hold.
and how was he -- Paul?
he'd been afraid of everything he was gonna lose in the divorce.
but after the fight, he looked at me and said, now...He could walk away from Laura, and he'd owe her nothing.
and he told me that he's gonna take all the money that we made in the burglaries, which really wasn't fair.
and then he said, he...He said, "that crazy bitch I married will finally get what she deserves for giving me such a worthless son."
so I took the gun out of my purse, and I shot him in the head.
to protect my family, I shot him.
if you were only following your brother because you were worried about him, why did you have a loaded gun in your purse?
I...I had been carrying that derringer around for months.
I liked it.
and I never liked it more than when I was blowing Paul's head off.
we finished booking Emily, so I think we're done here.
Oh, great. Thank you.
if you don't mind me butting in, my sister had thyroid cancer.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
wait a minute. How did you find out
Oh. Your father When they were handing out the gifts
merry Christmas. I've got cancer.
there's no easy way to say it, I guess.
guess you're right about that.
h-how is she, though?
Oh, she's fine now.
but I learned a lot from what happened to her.
like -- like what?
Well...No matter how frustrated I got with her, I always tried to keep her best interests at heart, because she wasn't able to do that for herself.
you'll see.
but if you ever need to talk about it, I know stuff.
Thanks. Thanks.
I'll remember that.
good night.
Oh, sorry. Am I late?
uh, what time is the reservation?
you're good.
very good, actually.
I hope we're not going anyplace too chichi.
well, mama, it's your last night here.
we have to go someplace little uptown.
before we go, I'd like to say something.
I-I'm sorry that I was so short with everybody last night.
y'all didn't deserve that.
especially you, Willie Ray.
I know I couldn't go through this without y'all.
so, from now on, I'm gonna be on my best behavior.
I promise.
and if anytime I fail to do that, you should feel free to hit me over the head or something.
no, no, I mean it.
hit me in the head until I pull it all together.
I don't think that will be necessary...
but I'll keep it in mind.
daddy, I have something to tell you, too.
I spoke to Jimmy and Bobby and Clay Jr. today, and we're all gonna come visit you after Christmas.
Oh, now, Clay, isn't that nice?
but the boys will be worried about me all during Christmas.
Willie Ray, I think we should get on the phone right now and -- and -- and settle this thing, talk to them about it.
we can do that before dinner.
clay, it's three hours later on the east coast.
now, don't start bossing me around!
when I make a decision, it depends on the needs of the moment, the facts, and the crisis at hand.
now, I will not have my son
we have reservations, Clay.
it's kind of a great place, too, daddy.
I think you'll like it.
thank you, Fritz.
anytime, Clay.
anytime at all.
stay in bed.
you've BEEN SO SWEET LATELY.
Mmm.
how's THE COFFEE? OH, IT'S VERY GOOD.
thank YOU.
Oh, YOU KNOW, I MEANT TO TELL YOU
your DAD CALLED THE OTHER DAY.
Really?
what DID HIS MESSAGE SAY?
well...
it DIDN'T...
quite GET TO THE ANSWERING MACHINE.
what DO YOU MEAN?
I ACCIDENTALLY PICKED UP YOUR PHONE.
[ gasps ] OH!
how MANY DIFFERENT WAYS DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY I AM SORRY?
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE SORRY.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE NOT PICKED UP THE PHONE WHEN MY FATHER CALLED.
what DO YOU EXPECT? OUR PHONES LOOK EXACTLY ALIKE.
and YOU NEVER PUT THE RECEIVERS BACK ON THE CORRECT CHARGER.
what EXACTLY DID MY FATHER SAY?
all HE SAID WAS, "IS BRENDA THERE?
and DID HE SEEM CONFUSED OR -- OR ANGRY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SEEMED LIKE, BRENDA, SINCE I HAVE NEVER MET OR SPOKEN TO YOUR FATHER BEFORE.
did YOU DO THIS ON PURPOSE?
Oh, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
I DID THIS ALL ON PURPOSE, BRENDA.
this IS ALL PART OF MY MASTER PLAN TO GET YOUR DAD TO HATE ME.
look, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
Yeah. THERE ARE NO ACCIDENTS.
Hello? HELLO?
Hello?
Yes, SERGEANT.
here SHE COMES.
no PRESSURE.
Gabriel: THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY STARTED DIGGING AROUND 8: 00 A.M. THIS MORNING.
a BULLDOZER UNCOVERED A BLUE TARP WITH A BODY WRAPPED IN IT.
the CORONER'S INVESTIGATOR REMOVED A WALLET
from THE BACK POCKET.
the I.D. SAYS, UH... DARRELL RICHARDS.
Oh!
new SHOES! NEW SHOES!
any IDEA HOW LONG HE'S BEEN DEAD?
the INVESTIGATOR SAID -- AND I QUOTE -- "A LONG TIME."
he WON'T EVEN SAY FOR SURE IF WE HAVE A HOMICIDE ON OUR HANDS.
well, HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING OUR BUDGET IF WE KEEP ROLLING OUT TO CRIME SCENES THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE CRIME SCENES?
chief POPE TOOK CARE OF THAT. HE WAS GONNA EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.
well, HE HASN'T.
that DOESN'T MAKE THIS OUR PROBLEM ANYWAY.
77th DIVISION HANDLES BODY DUMPS, NOT US.
wait. CHIEF.
Hello? CHIEF.
chief POPE, PLEASE. CHIEF!
they FOUND PROVENZA'S CARD IN THE DEAD GUY'S POCKET.
for HEAVEN'S SAKES. LET'S GO.
[ exhales SHARPLY ] THANK YOU.
well, LIEUTENANT, DOES THE FACE RING A BELL?
eh, LOST A LITTLE WEIGHT.
the TARP PRESERVED HIM. HE'S BASICALLY A MUMMY.
looks TO ME LIKE WE GOT A CHEAP FUNERAL ON OUR HANDS.
Daniels: NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF ANYTHING, EXCEPT A RELATIONSHIP WITH PROVENZA.
this IS AN OLD CARD, CHIEF.
I HAVEN'T HAD THAT NUMBER IN YEARS.
this DRIVER'S LICENSE EXPIRES IN 1995.
body MUST HAVE BEEN BURIED BEFORE THAT.
those BELTS HAVE BEEN POPULAR WITH GANG MEMBERS FOR A LONG TIME.
82nd STREET.
were YOU AN EIGHT-DEUCE?
this IS EIGHT-DEUCE TERRITORY.
buzz, WOULD YOU START DOCUMENTING THE SCENE, PLEASE?
Yes, MA'AM.
all RIGHT, THEN.
where DID THAT PAINT-SPATTERED TARP COME FROM?
is OUR VICTIM NAMED DARRELL RICHARDS?
and WAS HE REPORTED MISSING?
and, LIEUTENANT?
why DID HE HAVE YOUR BUSINESS CARD IN HIS POCKET?
you KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY HELP ME REMEMBER?
if YOU STARED AT ME SOME MORE.
um, I FOUND A MISSING-PERSONS REPORT FOR A DARRELL RICHARDS,
dated MAY 6, 1992.
that WAS A BUSY TIME. WHY?
the L.A. RIOTS. THEY STARTED APRIL 29, 1992.
DARRELL WAS REPORTED MISSING SEVEN DAYS LATER,
towards THE END.
can YOU CONFIRM HIS IDENTITY FROM THESE X-RAYS,
DR.CRIPPEN?
officially, NOT UNTIL THE FORENSIC DENTIST SIGNS OFF.
but THESE LOOK LIKE THE SAME TEETH TO ME.
now, UNOFFICIALLY,
I'd SAY THIS IS DARRELL RICHARDS -- 99. 9% SURE.
well, I CAN'T NOTIFY THE FAMILY UNTIL WE'RE 100%.
can YOU AT LEAST NARROW DOWN THE TIME OF DEATH?
well, WHEN DOES THAT REPORT SAY HE WENT MISSING?
UH...1992.
well, THEN I'D SAY 1992.
but -- Provenza: BUT WHAT?
you HAVEN'T TOLD US ANYTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW.
can YOU GIVE US A CAUSE OF DEATH OR NOT?
it IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE AN ENTRY WOUND GIVEN THE SHRINKAGE OF THE SKIN.
but I'D SAY THAT A BULLET...
...ENTERED THE SIDE, CONTINUED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART.
the HEART IS NO LONGER THERE, BUT THE BULLET IS.
great.
so...
Ugh. MAYBE THE, UH...
maybe THE GUY WAS FIRING AT SOMEONE AND GOT HIT UNDERNEATH?
that HIGH IN THE ARMPIT? AT A DOWNWARD ANGLE?
injury WOUNDS LIKE THAT ARE USUALLY AT CLOSE RANGE,
maybe LIKE HE WAS STRUGGLING WITH SOMEONE.
so, UNLESS THIS IS THE STRANGEST SUICIDE I'VE EVER SEEN,
I'd SAY WE HAVE OUR CAUSE OF DEATH.
so THE KID I GAVE MY CARD TO WAS MURDERED.
great.
every GUN CREATES A SIGNATURE ON THE BULLET IT HAS FIRED
a SIGNATURE AS INDIVIDUAL
as THE MEN WHO SIGNED THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,
which GAVE US THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.
that WAS THE BILL OF RIGHTS,
and IT DIDN'T INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO MURDER EACH OTHER.
back IN THE DIZZ-AY, BEFORE "CASINGS" BECAME THE THING,
we WERE GONNA CREATE A DATABASE FOR AMMUNITION
tao: BRIAN.
did YOU FIND A GUN TO MATCH OUR BULLET OR NOT?
I'm sorry. Brian's kind of a geek.
Really?
take A LOOK AT THESE.
now, ALL GUN BARRELS HAVE GROOVES ON THE INSIDE.
right.
when THE GUN IS FIRED, THE GROOVES PUT MARKS ON THE BULLET.
Mm-hmm.
anyway, I CHECKED ALL THE SPECS FROM YOUR BULLET IN THE CATALOG,
and I CAME UP WITH A COLT DIAMONDBACK.
I-I LOOKED UP ALL THE REVOLVERS BOOKED TWO WEEKS BEFORE DARRELL RICHARDS WAS ACTUALLY REPORTED MISSING.
now, IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A COUPLE OF DAYS FOR A FULL COMPARISON,
so IF YOU CAN HELP ME NARROW IT DOWN...
thank YOU.
Provenza, I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU TO PUT IN YOUR COFFEE.
it's GINKGO-BILOBA EXTRACT.
it's GOOD FOR YOUR MEMORY.
I AM NOT LOSING MY MEMORY, OKAY?
this KID WENT MISSING IN 1992.
that's LIKE THREE WIVES AGO.
well, WILL YOU REMEMBER TO TAKE IT?
lieutenant FLYNN, PLEASE LEAVE LIEUTENANT PROVENZA ALONE,
and TELL ME WHAT YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT THAT TARP.
okay, UH... LET ME SEE.
dawkins INDUSTRIES...
sold AND PRODUCED OVER 300, 000 OF THEM IN 1992.
to FIND THE PERSON WHO BOUGHT THIS ONE IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
so I'M LOOKING INTO THE PAINT.
I CHECKED INTO THE LOT WHERE WE FOUND THE BODY.
it's CHANGED HANDS A FEW TIMES SINCE '92,
but FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS, IT'S BEEN OWNED
...It's BEEN OWNED BY A SMALL DEVELOPER
who's BEEN FIGHTING A NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP ABOUT BUILDING ON IT.
sanchez: DEVELOPER LIVES IN CALABASAS.
as FAR AS I CAN TELL, NO GANG CONNECTIONS.
Brenda: ANY NEWS FROM CRIPPEN'S DENTIST?
Gabriel: NOTHING YET.
chief, IF OUR BODY TURNS OUT TO BE DARRELL RICHARDS,
he DEFINITELY COULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT-DEUCE.
it's GOT TO BE HERE!
lieutenant PROVENZA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
remembering.
there WAS SOMETHING
something IN ONE OF THESE GUN REPORTS THAT RANG A BELL
not THE GUN PER SE, BUT THE PERSON WHO TURNED IT IN
our OLD FRIEND FATHER JACK.
he BROUGHT IN A LOAD OF WEAPONS WITH SOME "GUNS FOR FOOD" INITIATIVE THE CITY STARTED AFTER THE RIOTS.
that WAS IN, UH... JUNE.
june 1992.
who's FATHER JACK? HE'S AN ASSHOLE.
Gabriel: HE'S A FRANCISCAN PRIEST THAT RUNS A PROGRAM THAT GETS GANG MEMBERS OFF THE STREETS,
finds THEM WORK, AND GIVES THEM A CHANCE.
which IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING
father JACK PROTECTS GANGBANGERS, DRUG DEALERS, AND COP KILLERS FROM EVER GETTING ARRESTED.
if YOU HAVE EVIDENCE FATHER JACK HAS EVER COMMITTED A CRIME,
why DON'T YOU JUST GO ARREST HIM?
because HE HIDES BEHIND THAT COLLAR -- WHEN HE WEARS IT.
come ON, MAN!
ladies, LADIES, PLEASE.
I REMEMBER GOING TO FATHER JACK'S PLACE RIGHT BEFORE THE RIOTS.
I-I WAS LOOKING INTO A SHOOTING IN, UH...
had TO HAVE BEEN MAY.
all RIGHT. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
someone TOOK SOME SHOTS AT A POLICE CAR.
now, I'D FINISHED. I WAS LEAVING.
kid COMES UP TO ME. I ASK HIM ABOUT THE SHOOTING.
he SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING,
but HE, UH, WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
so I, UH...
I GAVE HIM MY CARD.
that WAS MAY THE 4th.
2 DAYS LATER, MAY THE 6th,
DARRELL RICHARDS IS REPORTED MISSING.
beginning OF JUNE, FATHER JACK TURNS IN SOME GUNS,
one OF WHICH IS A COLT . 38 DIAMONDBACK.
so...
we CAN TELL BRIAN IN BALLISTICS
that WE JUST NARROWED IT DOWN FOR HIM.
Hi. I'M LOOKING FOR FATHER JACK.
thank YOU.
can I HELP YOU?
you MUST BE FATHER JACK.
I'm DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON, L.A.P.D.
I NEED TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.
is THAT YOUR OFFICE OVER THERE?
what's THIS ABOUT?
I'd PREFER TO SPEAK IN YOUR OFFICE IF YOU DON'T MIND.
why NOT ASK ME RIGHT HERE?
uh...
a BODY WAS UNEARTHED ON A HILLSIDE IN EIGHT-DEUCE TERRITORY.
well, THAT'S SAD, BUT IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.
considering THAT YOU TURNED IN THE MURDER WEAPON,
I'd SAY IT HAS QUITE A LOT TO DO WITH YOU.
I'll BE IN YOUR OFFICE.
pardon ME.
and YOU THOUGHT NUNS WERE TOUGH.
Gabriel: I REMEMBER WHEN THIS WAS A ONE-ROOM OPERATION.
I MEAN, IT IS TRULY AMAZING WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
Brenda: LIEUTENANT, THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS.
Yes, THAT'S GREAT, EVEN WITH OUR BUDGET RESTRAINTS.
thank YOU.
good NEWS, FATHER.
thanks TO MODERN DENTISTRY,
we NOW HAVE A POSITIVE I.D. ON OUR VICTIM
DARRELL RICHARDS.
now, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA HERE
remembers HANDING DARRELL HIS BUSINESS CARD.
right OUTSIDE YOUR DOORS, 1992.
did YOU KNOW HIM?
