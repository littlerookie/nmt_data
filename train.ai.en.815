we hit it off.
different from all the models-slash-actresses that I'm used to.
how about in person?
we never met in person.
it appears that you two had dinner last night before her murder.
murder?
look, uh...
we were supposed to hook up last night...
but she backed out on me.
um... I never even got her address.
what did you do immediately after you got off the computer?
went to work.
had some VIPs to entertain.
late night is when things really start to heat up.
can anyone verify that?
about a thousand people in the club.
I'm really sorry I can't be of more help, but be sure to let me know if there's anything else I can do.
I'll do that.
Hey, look who's back.
there's my hero.
did you get a nice homecoming, baby?
Hey, I don't want to talk about that.
you know what I want to talk about?
what happened to you?
he is what happened to me.
our drug dealer.
apparently, he took them, too.
his coffin nail of choice-- crystal meth.
so that explains why the stomach looks like that.
this is what knocked me out.
crystal meth is cut with ammonia, drain cleaner, even chloroform.
massive use can cause a build up of phosphine gas.
I would think that the gas would dissipate over time.
well, yeah, if somebody doesn't kill you before your body has a chance to absorb it.
you know the hair I found in his neck wound?
did you ever figure out who that belonged to?
what hair?
wait a minute.
I bagged it and I put it on the tray.
I got it.
so you said this is from the wound?
there's no skin tag, Alexx.
Oh, no, so there's no DNA?
that's all right.
it's short and it's coarse.
and the color's banded.
I'm guessing that it's probably from a dog.
do any of your suspects have a dog?
none that I know of.
but there's one that we suspect might be...
got blood on the door.
it's MDPD.
we have a warrant to search the premises.
we're coming in.
what the hell is that?
stay behind me - okay
thank God you're here.
somebody just tried to kill me.
guy came out of nowhere.
lucky I had protection.
I hit the ground, played dead.
played dead?
what happened to the outlaw warrior?
Hey, man, I'm alive.
did you see his face?
no.
just heard him scramble to get out.
maybe that's his blood on the door.
Yeah, that's the killer's first mistake.
let's make it his last.
let's get that blood over to the lab.
Shawn, sometimes a killer will leave a calling card.
what are you talking about?
we recovered your blood from the second crime scene.
and that's two in two days.
I- I don't know what to say.
so we have the missing lanyard from your locker, the cuts on your hands and now the blood, Shawn.
look, I know it sounds crazy.
but I can't explain it, okay?
I can't.
am I going to need a lawyer?
immediately.
what do you mean Horatio thinks the pool boy is innocent?
Yeah, he thinks it's possible Hodges is being framed, so I dug up one of his coworkers.
verified his locker was broken into.
so someone could have stolen the lanyard with his ID badge.
Yeah.
let me ask you something, Frank.
do you believe in all of this, you know, eclipse affecting people?
no, I don't believe in that hocus-pocus.
it is what it is, it ain't what it ain't, don't make it what it isn't.
okay.
Oh, look here.
just found a puncture hole in the metal with some blood on it.
there's one on this side, too.
where Hodges would grab it.
little bugger's telling the truth.
so someone was trying to set him up.
and that means that the person could have stolen a sample of Hodges blood and then planted it in Mario Montero's apartment.
so he could get off scot-free.
or maybe not.
found a little bit of trace on this chair.
I'll get this sample over to Trace.
that's odd.
what is it?
the trace Natalia found on the lounge chair is a topical cream.
suntan lotion?
that's hardly out of place on a pool chair.
no, it's stronger than that.
it's a medication for people with polymorphic light eruption.
Photoxicity? - Exactly.
an allergy to the sun.
you know, in extreme cases, even a few minutes can cause a person to blister, or breakout in hives, you know, even get a second-degree burn.
well, that definitely rules out Shawn Hodges.
I mean, he works out in the sun all day.
what are we not seeing?
and you say that I take everything at face value.
think outside the science for a minute.
twice this killer struck at night.
and the other time, it was during an eclipse.
the only time he can go out without risking sun exposure.
what about Nicholas Pike?
the guy who met Diana Long online.
he's a nightclub owner.
which makes him a night owl.
judge isn't going to give us a warrant based on that, though, so, how do we get him?
well, you know, it's a nice sunny day.
why don't we invite him outside and see if he shows?
Mr. Pike.
lieutenant Caine.
thank you for coming in.
we neglected to get a sample from you at the house the other day.
we'd like to do that today if it would be okay.
no problem.
what do you need, fingerprints?
something like that.
would you step out of the car, please.
Mr. Pike, this officer will escort you inside, and I appreciate your help today.
thank you.
my absolute pleasure.
I just talked to Eric and he said it's a no-go on Nicholas Pike.
well, swabs came back negative for photoxicity medication.
not even a suntan lotion.
great.
so what now?
well, I'm going to head over to the evidence locker.
night shift has turned in all their evidence on the Diana Long murder, so.
so, what do you want from me?
Diana Long was on the computer all the time, wasn't she?
Yeah. Samantha's still trying to pull everything up off her hard drive.
check in with her, would you ?
okay. I'll see you in a few.
that is wolf hair.
what?
Really?
how do you know?
because I met the wolf.
up close and personal.
it's Mario Montero's pet.
okay.
so Mario got his wolf's hair on him, and then shed it at not one, but two different crime scenes.
that makes sense because guess who she's been on the Internet with?
it's Mario Montero, our wolf boy.
and they've been chatting online together four to five hours a day.
so Mario was just as chained to his computer as Diana was.
so playing the victim was just an act?
that's what we're going to find out.
you know Diana Long?
wait, uh... Diana?
we know you had a relationship with her.
well, we had sex, yes.
but only online.
never in person.
then why did we find another one of your wolf hairs at her home?
one time, she let her last name slip.
thought I'd look her up.
see if she was all that.
you actually are good looking.
I'm sorry. Can I help you?
it's me, Diana.
what do you say we finish what we started?
I'm sorry, you have to leave.
she was fun online.
in real life, forget it.
can I go now?
no, not quite.
the killer has an allergy to the sun and uses prescription sunscreen.
and the swab will tell us if it's you.
well, then, swab away.
Hey, Calleigh.
so wolf man's clean.
no medication on his skin.
man, we went through his entire apartment, too.
there's no weapon, nothing.
Yeah, well, how are we going to possibly tie our killer to all of his victims?
okay, well, Mario and Diana were on the computer all the time,
Ronnie was at the cabana selling drugs.
it's like he knew their habits, their vulnerabilities and when to strike.
there's only one way that's possible.
he was watching them.
location: mario montero's apartment
well, we know our killer may have been spying on his victims.
I've taken all the photos from the three crime scenes and created panoramic views of the outside environments.
and it stands to reason if the killer could see his victims, it's possible they could see him.
Yes,'cause of line of sight.
if I superimpose the panoramas over each other, I get this.
there's an overlap which isolates this building.
what is the address of this building?
1205 Landon Street.
familiar?
it should be.
it's where Nicholas Pike lives.
Mr. Pike, it's Horatio Caine of the Crime Lab.
H, we're clear.
okay, Eric.
come here a minute.
this is how he selected his victims, Eric.
it looks like it's pre-progammed.
he can see into Diana Long's apartment.
victim number one.
it's the poolside cabana where Ronnie Temple was murdered.
victim number two.
he programmed in the order of his kills.
it's Mario's apartment.
victim number three and here goes victim number four.
it's just some kid playing video games.
H, those are the dorms over at Brigton College.
he's victim number four, Eric.
the sun is going down.
Mr. Pike?
Mr. Pike, turn around slowly.
put your hands in the air.
Mr. Pike, I'm not going to ask you a second time.
turn around slowly, get down on the ground, hands behind your head.
people seem to think there's an immediate reaction.
it's like a sunburn.
takes a while before it shows up.
we have plenty of time.
so I have a sun allergy, and I was at some kid's dorm.
so what?
I think that it's quite a bit more than that.
did you find a murder weapon on me?
as a matter of fact, we have.
it's your wristwatch.
take it off, please.
let me guess.
it's, uh, victims' blood.
I was normal once.
active.
I spent every moment I could outdoors.
my body turned against me.
the sun became poisonous.
I was going bloody mad stuck in my house.
used the telescope to go to places I couldn't.
I was lonely.
then I got obsessive.
Diana and Mario talked all day on their computer.
they lived three minutes apart.
and that loser, spending his days selling drugs by the pool.
this life...
we only get one go-round.
they all wasted it.
Oh, my God.
they were never really alive.
I was doing them a favor.
but that's not for you to decide, is it, Mr. Pike?
good to have you back, Mr. Wolfe.
it's good to be back.
you went to bat for me.
I'm never going to forget that.
it's in your blood, isn't it?
never forget that.
I won't.
Mr. Wolfe, at the end of the day, if we don't hang together, we'll die alone.
this the season here in Miami.
fashion season, that is.
designers, models and celebrities have gathered from all over the world to be part of the launch of next year's spring and summer line.
and the show that kicks off the weeklong party...
Miami's own Gavin Hauer.
thank you, Kirsten.
now who said the human body was perfection?
if it were, it wouldn't break down.
exactly why I chose platinum as my muse.
it's immortal-- it's me improving on the original.
thank you, Kirsten.
ladies and gentlemen, introducing the new line from Gavin Hauer.
are they canceling the show?
Oh my god! What's her name, Alexx?
she was only 21.
she got family here in Miami?
no, Frank spoke to them in Louisiana.
she was their only daughter moved Miami to be famous.
are those joule marks?
Yes.
only get these kinds of burns with a massive electrical shock.
this is where the current exited her body.
if you follow the burn marks, they'll trace back to where the current entered her - her right hand which is attached to the pole.
somebody killed this girl, Alexx.
not a very private place to kill someone.
because the killer wanted it to be seen.
think someone was sending a message?
I do, Alexx.
and I just got it.
it was an accident.
there's no way that Alisha was murdered.
a girl that nice doesn't have any enemies.
what about you?
I don't have any either.
now I'm sorry about what happened.
I'll even dedicate my next show to Alisha, but I've got to get that stage packed up and on a plane to Paris.
you're gonna have to find another one, Mr. Hauer.
your stage is our crime scene.
that stage is like the clothing I design.
I hand make it.
it's one of a kind.
so you rigged the pole that killed the girl.
I'm gonna let you in on a trade secret.
there's no money to be made in fashion.
it's all about staying in the game long enough until your name goes platinum.
why would I sabotage my own show?
maybe you've got something to hide.
you got anything?
come here and take a look at this.
all these lights are tagged with a girl's name and her hair color.
so this is Juliana's light.
she has red hair.
this is Lindsey's light.
she's a brunette.
and here's Alisha's.
so each model had their own lighting design.
that means Alisha's would've only been on when she was onstage.
when Alisha's light got power, she got power.
but why didn't she get electrocuted until she touched the pole?
well, the killer had to connect the two, right?
my guess is it ran something from the lights to this pole here.
and here's the wire.
here's what's left of the murder weapon.
the killer used uninsulated wire ensuring it would melt eliminating the evidence.
you know, it certainly seems like whoever did this knew that the evidence would disappear.
if you ask me, whoever did this, knew exactly what they were doing.
like a lighting director?
you're the lighting director for the show, is that correct, Mr. Kerr?
that's right.
why would there be a wire running from one of Alisha Reilly's lights to a pole on the stage?
no, there'd be no reason for that.
unless someone wanted to murder her.
don't look at me.
I didn't have any problem with that girl.
what about your crew, any of them have a problem with her?
what crew?
hauer was too cheap to hire one.
I had to do the whole job by myself.
th's why I know there's no way this could've happened.
was there anybody else who had access underneath the stage?
I'm the only one with any reason to be down there if that's what you mean.
makes you our number one suspect.
don't go anywhere.
well, Terrence Kerr was successful in only creating more suspicion for himself.
he claims he was the only person down here.
well, does he have red hair?
no. Why?
Because...somebody down here did.
well, that's an easy mystery to solve.
which model had red hair?
why are you trying to blame me?
well, actually, it's because we found your hair under the stage.
we're wondering why a model would need to even be down there.
well, if I tell you, do you promise not to say anything?
well, honestly, it depends on what you tell me.
well, before each show, I always try to make nice with the lighting guy.
I mean, you know how it is.
good lighting covers a multitude of sins.
so you...you were making nice with Terrence Kerr under the stage?
Yeah. Yeah, it was kind of cramped.
someone will hear us.
did Alisha ever get, uh... involved with Mr.Kerr?
no, she didn't mess around.
Alisha was kind of boring.
did she have many friends outside of work?
it's hard to say.
she kept her personal life to herself.
did she do anything different lately?
did she do anything out of character?
she was late for rehearsal last night.
didn't show for over an hour.
and when she did, it looked like she'd been crying.
you know what I mean.
I do, Ms. Ravez.
thank you.
you're free to go.
that didn't get us anywhere.
well, we know that Alisha was upset.
Yeah, but why would a 21- year-old girl get so upset that she'd show up late for work?
that's easy.
boyfriend.
Hey, Alexx, do me a favor, would you?
rush a sex kit on Alisha Reilly.
can I have some space, please, so I can finish this?
sorry, okay. We're just short on good leads with this one.
I'm not.
looks like our victim was married.
how can you tell that from a sex kit?
because it comes back to a guy currently serving time, and the only way you can have a conjugal visit with a prisoner is if you're married to them.
so who's she married to?
that's the guy who kidnapped Horatio's son.
Yeah. No wonder why Alisha was keeping her personal life a secret.
Yeah, well, I would, too, if I was married to one of the most dangerous men in Miami.
Hi, it's Eric.
you never told me you were married, Joe.
Alisha and I hooked up just before I became a guest of the county.
you know she's a model.
guys in here go crazy when she comes strutting in.
it sounds like it.
well, Joe, that part of the journey is over.
Alisha was killed this morning.
and you came all the way out here to tell me yourself?
I am so touched.
I don't get the connection, Joe.
to be crude-- a conjugal's a conjugal.
right, but what's in it for her?
I set her up as a model. - Okay.
so that's how she met Gavin Hauer.
I know a lot of people.
Yes, from your hero dealing.
when I first met Alisha, she was straight off the bus, she needed my help.
I made her dreams come true.
but she left here the other day in tears.
Oh, I see.
so you think I killed my wife.
a bit difficult for a man in my situation.
you have people on the outside.
like you do in here.
by the way, Oscar's a great choice as a bodyguard for your son.
loyal, not too smart.
I'm glad you approve.
what happens now?
I don't know.
I get the sense,
look, man, why don't you go do some warm-ups by the chin-up bar?
you staying out of trouble?
it hasn't been too easy.
it's about to get more complicated.
what do you mean?
trust no one.
what about Oscar?
Oscar has a problem.
take care, son.
you've got a pair of eyes on you.
you think I don't know that?
watch your back.
hey there, Frank.
please tell me there's a good reason you dragged me into this charming little establishment.
besides the amazing joy I get from knowing you've been inconvenienced,
I need you to do something for me.
okay, what is that?
we need to find out who LeBrock's giving orders to on the outside.
maybe he had one of his goons kill his wife for him.
now, been checking the jail's visitation logs.
okay, so you need help reading.
that's cute.
aside from Alisha, he's had only one visitor, which is a guy named Scott Garnet.
okay, so why exactly do you need me to be here?
Scott Garnet doesn't exist.
the address and phone he left are fake.
now, he met LeBrock here shortly after Alisha left, so I need you, my favorite dust monkey, to lift prints off visitor stall number four.
Yeah.
but there's got to be dozens of prints over there.
Yes. Means you better get busy.
take a look at this one.
Joe has a son?
it looks like we found our Scott Garnet.
my father is not an easy man to get along with.
I don't see him anymore.
Yes, but, Scott, you just visited him in jail the other day under a false name, didn't you?
you try carrying around LeBrock as a last name.
that's the only reason you dragged me in here - because of my father.
I dragged you in here because your stepmother Alisha is dead.
I didn't know the chick.
my father never talked about her to me.
what did you guys talk about, then?
that's between me and him.
not anymore.
keep an eye on him.
is that Scott LeBrock?
as a matter of fact, it is.
I just received a call from the FBI.
they have their own ongoing investigation into him.
he's under surveillance?
for what?
justice Department thinks he's wrapped up in something big.
they don't want him to get spooked.
they're asking us to back off.
okay, what if he's my connection between LeBrock and the victim, Rick?
I'm sorry, Horatio.
the Feds are coming down hard on this.
brass feels we should comply.
I understand.
I'm serious about this.
don't mess with them.
I agree, Rick.
anything else?
no.
thank you.
Natalia, your connections at the FBI-- I need them.
special Agent Farallon.
you look good.
Thanks.
thanks for coming-- I really appreciate it, Mike.
are you kidding?
you saved my career three years ago.
on that Sonora case.
you know, that was some of the worst preserved blood I think I'd ever seen.
and you were able to replicate it.
Or...whatever it is that you do.
so, what do you need?
does the name Scott LeBrock sound familiar?
what, have you been keeping tabs on me?
on the record, we're not surveilling him;
he's not part of an ongoing investigation.
tell that to the young woman that's in the morgue, 'cause we think that Scott might be linked to her murder.
don't know anything about that.
come on.
what about the surveillance teams?
can't do it.
look, Mike, does what you know trump what I know about you?
I need those tapes.
would this make us even?
I need the tapes today, and I'll get 'em back to you before you ever need an excuse.
how's it coming? - Good.
the XRF confirms that the wire used to electrocute Alisha Reilly was a platinum alloy.
that's a rare metal, not to mention if there's a low nickel content, it's very expensive.
that's why I'm testing it against the wire used in Alisha's dress.
they both have the same nickel percentage.
so that means that wire came from the same batch of platinum that Gavin used in his clothing line.
he said he made every piece by hand.
I would say he had a hand in more than just designing the clothes.
Mr. Hauer, can I ask you a few more questions, please?
I've already told you everything I know.
well, you neglected to mention that Alisha was killed with a platinum wire that matches the platinum you use in your clothing line.
that's because I don't know what you're talking about.
every piece in this line has platinum in it.
then I'm gonna need to take all the clothes.
you already got my stage.
you can't have the clothes.
the clothes go to Paris for a show in two days.
Mr. Hauer, the evidence is in our favor.
it's not gonna be hard for me to get a warrant.
well, then I'll give my lawyer the heads up.
Hauer's lawyers are throwing up roadblocks, so it's gonna be a while before we get a warrant.
at least we have Alisha's outfit.
Yeah, I got it from Wolfe.
getting a strange smell from this.
here.
it smells like vinegar.
Yeah, but only in the burnt areas.
must he been released during the electrocution.
why are you testing for drugs?
I helped out on this bust a few months ago in Key West, and, uh, the dealers, they torched the place.
by the time the fire was put out, we went back and there was this distinct smell.
it's heroin.
it's weird because I checked before and I didn't find any drug residue on the fabric.
that's because it's not on the fabric.
it the fabric.
MDPD, everyone in here out front and against the wall.
Mr. Hauer.
you better have a warrant.
merry Christmas.
wow, this is quite a lab you have set up here.
I dye my own fabric.
Oh, let me ask you.
is heroin the new black?
because Alisha Reilly's clothes were made of it.
that's insane.
let me tell you what I know.
heroin in its purest form is a liquid.
it's smuggled here, probably from Mexico.
you soak your clothing in a concentrated solution, infusing it with heroin.
when the clothes reach their destination, they go on show.
no one's the wiser.
after the show, they're put in a separating vat.
the heroin's extracted using a chemical process.
you put the extracted heroin into an oven and cook the liquid into a solid which is then soldon the street.
it' called "heroin starching."
you're smuggling drugs with your clothes.
in every country we've been to, no one ever checked the clothes.
except Alisha Reilly.
she was going to stop you from going to Paris.
that's why you killed her.
I told you I had nothing to do with that.
Yeah, well, did Joe LeBrock?
that's precisely why I didn't kill her.
you'd have to be crazy or stupid to kill LeBrock's girl.
so you know Joe?
that's who you were smuggling the heroin for.
you guys think I'm gonna roll on LeBrock?
like I said, stupid and crazy.
I bet Horatio's gonna want to have a conversation with LeBrock.
I'm sure.
Oscar, eyes on the work!
someone wants to see you.
lieutenant, shouldn't you be out catching my wife's killer?
that's exactly what I'm doing here, Joe.
we busted Gavin Hauer's heroin operation.
now, why would that matter to me?
because Gavin was smuggling for you, wasn't he?
good luck getting anyone to testify to that.
I guess somebody should have mentioned that to Alisha, huh?
Why's that?
because Alisha found out about the smuggling, didn't she?
let's just say she didn't understand the world of business, so I straightened her out.
everyone stay on the ground!
we have an explosion on site at Cooper Park.
possible critical injuries.
that wasn't necessary, Joe.
get me rescue down here immediately, right now.
rescue's coming.
I'm sor... I'm sorry, man.
I want you to hang on, okay?
I tried to do right.
I did what you said.
you did, Oscar.
you did exactly what I asked.
everything.
and I won't forget it.
LeBrock, let's go.
according to the CO, the inmates were assigned to this area for a week.
Oscar had been working this stump the past few days.
so whoever planted the bomb would have known that.
I mean, LeBrock is part of the crew.
it's not hard to imagine that he did it.
except there were too many guards around.
what have you got?
got a SIM card.
from a cell phone?
Yeah, cell phones make great trigger devices for bombs.
all one has to do is make a simple phone call.
SIM card's a cell phone's memory, which means that if this is intact, the bomber's phone number's in here.
well, you know, it doesn't look too damaged.
this will tell us for sure.
okay, that's the number of the caller that detonated the bomb.
can you try reverse phone directory?
sure.
you picked up the surface computing quickly.
wasn't that hard. Samantha got me up to speed.
so you were just using it as an excuse to hit on the new girl?
Yeah, she, she, uh, saw through it, too.
okay, there's no name attached to the cell phone.
this is a prepaid cell.
what about a service provider?
can you use that to get me a location on the call?
I can't get you a location, but I can get you the nearest cell tower.
the call originated from a cell tower at Tamiami Trail and Kenwood.
not a lot of civilization out there.
that's the Everglades.
that's where the Miami-Dade Department of Detention is located.
call came from inside the building.
evacuate cell block D.
prepare to be searched.
next cell.
Where'd you get the phone?
I've never seen it before.
they found it under your bunk, Kyle.
it's not mine.
Kyle, they're gonna charge you for murder.
it's not my cell phone, okay?
who had access to your bunk?
I don't know.
did LeBrock have access?
you know what? I'm not your snitch, okay?!
do this yourself.
guard, I'm done with this guy.
Calleigh says that you are the A/V wiz.
is that right?
well, my reputation precedes me.
in fact, one time...
awesome, because I need you to go through all these surveillance videos of Scott LeBrock and see if you can find anything that would connect his father to the bombing or to the murder of Alisha Reilly.
Where'd you get these?
the FBI.
they suspect him of a federal crime.
I don't know what it is, but here's the DVDs.
how many hours of video you got here?
Oh, like, five-weeks worth.
Hey.
where you going?
I got it, you watch it.
you know, I still haven't found the dress missing the platinum string that was used to kill Alisha Reilly.
but we know that the killer could have only taken the wire from one of these dresses, so it has to be here.
take a look at this.
string's not missing, but it doesn't look like platinum.
pass me the XRF, please?
Yeah.
nothing platinum about this.
those are alloys found in aluminum foil.
I think foil's a little low-rent for Gavin, don't you?
not if you're looking to replace a platinum string in a hurry.
whose dress is it?
it's the red-haired model-- Juliana Ravez.
I think we just found our killer.
you put on a pretty good act this morning, didn't you, Juliana.
I'm sorry?
the dress you wore in the show.
it's missing a platinum string which you replaced with an aluminum one.
so?
that platinum string from your dress, it was used to rig the light that electrocuted Alisha.
but how would I even know how to do that?
Oh, come on. You said it yourself.
you have a habit of making nice with the lighting guys.
I'm sure you picked up a few tricks.
that string's just as good as a smoking gun.
she had such a good thing going.
you knew why Alisha was upset last night.
she told you about the heroin.
like I didn't know.
well, who did you think you were marrying?
I can't be involved in this, Juliana.
I have to go to the police.
just calm down.
we'll do the show and then we'll talk to someone, okay?
so did Joe have you kill her?
Joe had nothing to do with it.
so you're saying Joe doesn't know?
she wasn't worthy of him...
but I've proven that I am.
so you want LeBrock for yourself.
he treated her like a queen.
I would have killed to have that.
and you did.
well, what do you think? Can we charge LeBrock for inspiring a murder?
no, but we can still get him on the bombing.
Yeah, well, we'd better hurry up because Kyle's time is running out.
you lied to me, Kyle.
I don't know what you're talking about.
the phone belongs to you.
all the calls were made to a number in Pensacola.
I know that number.
it used to belong to your mother.
I want to find her.
did you make the call that detonated the bomb?
I need you to believe me.
I didn't do it.
who gave you the phone?
he said it was a peace offering.
Hey, kid.
now, I don't know what you've heard about me, but you know I'd be a fool to try to hurt you now.
I know how hard it can be for a family to find time to visit.
at least you can tell them how you're doing.
Hey, kid.
just keep it hidden.
I'm sorry.
there is a way out of this, but you can't lie to me.
never lie to me again.
the only viable prints I pulled off the phone belong to Kyle.
it's not looking good for him.
Yeah, but it doesn't mean that he did it.
cause Horatio thinks somebody may have stolen the phone and made that call.
let's hope the court sees it that way.
well, I found trace all over the phone.
so I'm hoping that's going to help us out.
equal parts carbon black pigment, mineral oil and dispersant.
some kind of ink?
Yeah, but there's no quick-dry agent present.
so it's not from a pen.
but you know what doesn't use a quick-dry agent?
fingerprint ink.
so it would have to be from somebody who was recently processed into detention.
no talking in the print line.
and Kyle's been in there for weeks.
check the, uh, detention center database.
see who was processed just before the time of the bombing.
okay, we've got it narrowed down to three.
that's about as close as we're going to get for right now.
then Horatio's going to have to talk to all of them.
these bruises?
got them from a bunch of guys who jumped me right after I processed in.
happens to everyone on their first day.
I played the game; didn't look anyone in the eye, you know.
a cell phone?
I didn't think you could have a cell phone in prison.
I don't even know where the bathrooms are.
you think I could find some kid's cell?
LeBrock, yeah.
the CO told me to stay away from him.
who doesn't know LeBrock?
don't know a guy named LeBrock.
come on, Corey, everybody in your world knows Joe.
he got to you right after you were processed in and he's just offered you protection, hasn't he?
that's why you don't have any bruises.
I don't need anyone's protection.
then why did you do him a favor?
I didn't steal some brat's cell phone.
the ink on your fingers isn't even dry yet.
Corey, I understand that you're looking at a year.
and if you sign this confession, I'll make sure it doesn't get kicked up to life.
if I sign one, it becomes my death sentence.
you decide.
miss Nevins.
I'm assuming you know Kyle's hearing is later today.
I do.
the evidence that Kyle's responsible for the bombing was overwhelming.
Rebecca, what if I were to tell you I have an inmate who claims to have detonated the bomb?
is he willing to testify?
I'm working on it.
you're going to have to do better than that, 'cause a witness just came forward who's willing to testify under oath that he sold Kyle that cell phone.
and by witness, you mean Joe LeBrock?
doesn't matter who it is.
it matters if he's behind the bomb.
Horatio, I have to present the strongest case.
you know, I've been through every hour of this surveillance video, and I haven't found anything that suggests that Scott LeBrock is working for his father.
there's gotta be something.
there is, but it's not what you think.
it's got LeBrock from two weeks ago.
he doesn't know he's being surveilled.
they're in a park. It's a good place for a clandestine meeting.
clandestine meeting with a little boy?
Hey, buddy.
Hey!
want to go for another ride?
what are we watching?
Yeah. Can you buy me another video game?
Scott LeBrock. He's a pedophile.
now, your Fed buddies rushed in and pulled the kid out, but they never arrest him.
no, check it out. They did.
that's the agent I got the video from.
so they just let him go?
they didn't prosecute him.
no, believe me, they will get him for that.
but they were surveilling him on a different case.
Horatio needs to see this.
looking for a little alone time with me before I testify, Sergeant?
after you, Mr. LeBrock.
why am I not surprised?
here stop me from testifying against your kid?
you killed Oscar Monahan, Joe.
that's why you're not surprised.
but the smoking cell phone was in your kid's hands.
after you put it there.
you like reality television, Joe?
take a look at that.
recognize your son behind the wheel?
boy, you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel this time, Caine.
how long did it take you to rig that up?
Joe, I don't think I have to spell out to you what this means inside.
you're going to pay for your son's sins.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.
now I'm late for court.
your Honor, this cell phone was used to detonate an explosive device which resulted in Oscar Monahan's death.
did you sell this cell phone to Kyle Harmon?
it certainly looks familiar.
Mr. LeBrock, can you identify Kyle Harmon for the court?
Mr. LeBrock?
can you identify Kyle Harmon for the court?
I would... but I don't see him here.
you said you sold this phone to him.
Yes, but I don't see Kyle Harmon in this room.
is that not in fact Kyle Harmon?
if that's Kyle Harmon, who did I sell my phone to?
Mr. LeBrock, you stated you sold this phone to Kyle Harmon.
you know, I'm not even sure I'd recognize that phone.
that's enough, Miss Nevins.
your Honor...
we're done here.
the court finds that there's insufficient evidence to Mr. Harmon to answer.
case dismissed.
look at me.
what did you in there?
I was sparing Joe some embarrassment.
but it's okay to embarrass me?
I looked like a fool in there.
the boy is my son.
Rebecca! You made it!
are you kidding, Kate?
where are you off to?
spain, Italy and Greece.
can you believe it?
Denny got a yacht. It's vulgar, I know.
where is your other half, anyway?
uh, he's probably off closing one last deal before I whisk him away.
I like to win.
there are some sweet - looking women here, Dennis.
hook me up.
hook you up?
you're a married man.
whoa, who's that?
that's Mia, one of our nannies.
she's your nanny?
my wife only hires trolls.
I wonder why.
Jonah, why don't you stay a while, hang out?
it's your party, dad, not mine.
mommy?
mommy?
mommy?
mommy!
mommy!
uh, what is it, honey?
mommy's a little busy right now.
but, mommy!
okay.
Oh, my god, Megan!
what happened to you?
are you okay?
what happened?
Vanessa won't wake up.
Oh, my god!
call the police. Call the police.
lieutenant?
Mr. Lambert.
I can't believe it.
in my own home.
and my daughter.
who was Vanessa?
Vanessa was one of her nannies.
she's been with us over a year.
she was upstairs working. - Okay.
who would want to hurt her?
I'm ashamed to admit it - Vanessa took care of our lives, but I didn't know much about hers.
you know how it goes.
hard enough keeping tabs on your own family.
I want you to stay home and talk to no one.
we're supposed to leave town this weekend for two months.
you're gonna have to put that on hold.
my family and I have nothing to hide.
then we shouldn't have a problem.
she has two stab wounds in the upper torso, Horatio, consistent with a knife.
I don't see the weapon.
these footprints look like some kind of horror movie.
and a five-year-old girl found her.
Yes, who didn't see the murder.
well, this is interesting.
her fingernail beds are already discolored.
they have a bluish tint.
normally they're colorless after death.
I'll get into this and let you know.
please do.
Mr. Wolfe.
Hey. The techs have printed and swabbed all the guests.
they've been cooperative.
okay, well, the guests at the party were outside, weren't they?
Oh, yeah, I guess it would make that glass out of place, wouldn't it?
I'll, um...
I'll bring it to the lab and make sure it's not the victim's.
thank you, Mr. Wolfe.
all of these knives are negative for blood.
well, if the killer grabbed the weapon from the kitchen, it stands to reason they'd put it back there, too.
hide it in plain sight.
Yep.
here we go, this is... this is the last of 'em.
nothing.
can we help you? I - it's Jonah, right?
uh, yeah.
just wanted to get something to eat.
are you okay? - Yeah.
everything just sucks, that's all.
I know.
I'm really sorry.
were you very close to Vanessa?
not really.
but she and Megan were tight.
how so?
they did everything together.
you can see why I wasn't exactly thrilled to go on our trip.
mom and dad.
Megan and Mary Poppins.
I don't fit in.
so Vanessa was gonna go with you?
I don't know who wanted her there more, my parents or my sister.
Jonah, you'd better remove yourself from the house until we're done. Okay?
this is a nice guesthouse.
Yeah. Well, there are two beds, so I'm guessing both nannies lived here.
looks like Vanessa was packing to go on the family vacation.
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm the lightest packer in the world, but who takes all of their photographs with them?
Yeah.
inside the picture frames? - Yeah.
this place looks awfully empty.
I don't know that she was going away on a trip.
no. She was packing to go away permanently.
it's true, yeah, I had to let Vanessa go.
in fact, today was her last day.
were you not happy with her work?
Oh, no, on the contrary.
she did it too well.
when Megan got sick, she called out for Vanessa.
when she went to bed, she wanted Vanessa to tuck her in.
isn't that why you hired her?
there.
all done.
what ya got, sweetie?
a picture of a family.
is that you? - Yeah.
and that's daddy, and that's Jonah, and, then, that's you.
Oh, my god, I love it.
thank you. Thank you.
I know what you must think - that I deserved this.
two nannies when I'm only working part-time.
it's not that I don't want to be a great mother.
I'm just... not capable.
are you capable of murder?
never.
no. Vanessa was wonderful.
not in a million years would I want something like this to happen to her.
well, I hope that that's the truth, for your family's sake.
there she is!
Hey, I - I'm really sorry. I got behind.
Yeah, I heard you've been at the gun range logging some serious hours.
man, you know, in the last month, I think I've seen more target people than real people.
well, hang in there - it, uh, it gets easier.
speaking of real people, any idea who was using the glass I found next to our victim?
well, let's see if Codis is our friend.
Yep, she is.
wait, Codis is a she?
look at this.
the DNA from the rim of the glass matches a reference sample that we got from one of our party guests.
Yeah. Look where he works: Model nannies.
model nannies - that can't be a coincidence.
so, I'm guessing Vanessa knew Ron.
let's find out how well.
let's see, you earned a bs in child development.
scored a 92 outside with our test kids.
you know, we place with some of the wealthiest families.
and you are very easy on the eyes.
welcome to model nannies, Heather.
thank you!
I'll call you later.
can I help you?
you know a young lady named Vanessa Waters?
uh, well...yes, I did.
Vanessa was incredibly talented-- it's terrible what happened to her.
we found your drinking glass next to her dead body, Ron.
Whoa-ho-ho, wait, are you accusing me of murder?
Vanessa was one of my best clients.
who was coincidentally fired this morning.
Vanessa was a rare find - cute, smart, a caregiver, born and bred.
but the rich are very hard to please.
you run a placement agency.
I imagine you get a cut on each deal, huh? - Sure.
I put them in good homes, make sure they get a room, a car, medical benefits.
for that, I get ten percent of their salary.
you lost ten percent, and she lost her life.
no, I just wanted to find out what happened so it wouldn't happen again.
I can't believe she fired me.
those children love me.
it's not about that.
what did I tell you the first day you came in, Vanessa?
to respect the family's space.
especially the mother's. But I did.
then why are we having this discussion?
I don't know - they hired me to watch their children.
that's what I was doing.
no, they hired you to make up for all of their weaknesses without rubbing it in their faces.
now I have to do damage control and we're both out a lot of money.
that's it.
I left her to pack her things.
you talk a good game, Mr.Coswell.
I have to.
I deal with celebrities, CEOs, politicians.
they all want results no matter what it takes.
I know the feeling.
Hey, Calleigh. - Hi.
I just finished up our girl.
so she was a nanny, huh?
Yes, and seemingly a very good one.
your parents are well off.
did you ever have a nanny?
mm, I wish.
it would've been nice to have a voice of reason in that house.
you know, my mom, she was...
I don't know, she was really more of a friend than an authority figure.
and my dad is just...
well, we all know that story.
did you ever figure out why her fingernails were blue?
Yeah. I sure did.
you know what made her fingernail beds discolored?
cyanosis.
is that lack of oxygen in the blood?
that's right. Something compromised her circulatory system.
and her body was fighting it.
I'm gonna go take a little break.
now there are a lot of possible causes.
congenital heart disease, asthma.
but she didn't suffer from any of them.
what do you think it was?
tox will tell us for sure.
but it was the stabbing that definitely did her in.
penetration was deep, knife entered between the third and fourth ribs.
so her killer was either passionate or panicked.
and haste leaves behind evidence.
I found something in the wound tract.
I'm not quite sure what to make of it.
I'll take it to trace.
seems the fragment Alexx pulled from Vanessa Waters' chest is comprised of zirconium dioxide.
what?
there's ceramic in her wound?
well, how is that possible? Vanessa was, uh...
she was stabbed.
exactly.
but I think I know by what.
I have one in my own kitchen.
a ceramic knife.
Yeah, sorry, I'm more of a drive-thru type of guy.
well, a ceramic knife doesn't dull like a regular one.
and, believe it or not, they can be twice as hard as steel.
so why were there fragments of ceramic in the wound?
because ceramic knives are strong, but they're not invincible.
so if you twist or you pry it, it's gonna snap.
like if you wedge it between two bones.
but Calleigh and Eric didn't find any ceramic knives at the house.
the party was catered, right?
so maybe the catering company used them.
Yeah.
Eric, hey, it's me.
you're at the lambert house?
what?
I gave my reference samples or whatever.
they told me I can go.
I got another job I got to get to.
you're not gonna make it.
you know, I recognize you from a photo in Vanessa Waters' room.
Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Vanessa.
which you neglected to mention in your statement.
nobody asked.
where are the knives you used today?
they're all in the back of the truck.
you mind if l taking a look?
be my guest.
how well did you know Vanessa?
we dated a while back.
broke up, I don't know, six months ago.
and how did that end?
not good.
does it ever?
running into her today was a total coincidence, all right?
I'm a chef, but I don't get to choose my clients.
there's no murder weapon, H.
lieutenant Caine!
you have to come inside.
my husband and I, we were just robbed.
a quarter of a million dollars gone.
quarter of a million dollars, that's a lot of motive.
Vanessa probably died for it, Eric.
first Vanessa, now this?
well, there are no signs of forced entry.
what about fingerprints, Eric?
there are prints all right, but they're not from anyone's fingertips.
no arches, loops or whorls.
they're from somebody's knuckles.
killer thought they were being smart, but knuckle prints are actually unique.
Mr. Lambert, who had access to the safe?
just me and my wife and our nannies.
you give your nannies the code to the safe?
in case something happens to us.
besides the cash, our will is in there. All of our important papers.
we trust our nannies. We have to.
your other nanny, what's her name?
where is she right now?
in her room packing.
since Vanessa's gone, she's coming with us on our trip.
go talk to her, Eric.
Yeah, I'm gonna need to speak to her.
hang on a second.
Mr. Lambert, do you have a surveillance system here?
no, just an alarm. Why do you ask?
because we're being monitored as we speak.
excuse me, officer.
you see that?
right there is a camera.
Hi.
you're that cop.
you have a minute? I need to ask you a few questions about Vanessa.
it's weird.
seeing her stuff like that.
and now she's gone.
you're here to take her place, though, right, on the trip?
what's that supposed to mean?
Lambert's safe got robbed today.
you know the combination.
Vanessa catch you stealing?
you think I kill her?
Vanessa was my friend.
we were like family.
we had to be.
how so?
the two of us ran this house.
I cooked, she cleaned.
I took their calls, she took in the dry cleaning.
I thought your job was to baby-sit the lamberts' kids.
are you kidding me?
we're family managers.
we are teachers, pediatricians, bodyguards, accountants, marriage counselors.
we did everything the lamberts didn't want to do.
including raise their own children.
you don't sound too happy to be here.
no, I am. I am.
cause if you weren't, $250, 000 wouldn't be a bad severance package, would it?
no.
accuse me all you want, but I didn't do anything.
she was my friend.
so these are the computers from the Lambert house, huh?
all five of them.
one each for the mom, dad, both the children, and one for the nannies.
you know, I remember when we just had a TV.
and we know for sure that there was a nanny cam in the air purifier?
we do. The camera was a wi-fi short range and the signal was being picked up by one of the computers.
so who's our voyeur?
mommy dearest.
so she had a spy cam in the room with the safe.
does that mean that she caught the thief in the act?
no, that would be impossible because somebody moved the camera.
so whoever took the money, knew about the camera.
what I don't get is, if you're trying to spy on the nanny, how come you got a camera in the office?
I know, it's the last place they'd be.
but check out this folder on the mom's desktop.
you won't believe what I found.
it's called "cam clips."
and that says "Dennis' bathroom."
and I'm suddenly getting the urge to cover my eyes.
this was from two weeks ago.
that's not good.
mom wasn't spying on the nannies, she was spying on the husband.
and for good reason.
Vanessa was close to the daughter.
and getting closer to the husband.
you know, I would say that that is motive times two.
turns out that it was you who set up the video camera.
you did?
I can't believe you put a camera in our house without telling me about it.
you know, I just wanted Jonah and Megan to be safe.
but in truth, Mrs. Lambert, it's your husband you don't trust.
excuse me?
we saw the video on your computer.
you mean the one of my husband and Vanessa fooling around in the bathroom?
she's a gorgeous young girl, Dennis.
I'm not blind.
Kate, Vanessa and I weren't messing around.
then what were you doing? - We were talking.
talking?
about what?
she... she told me that Jonah is gay.
what? Our son?
what are you talking about? He's not gay.
Vanessa overheard him tell Craig that he loved him.
excuse me.
who's Craig?
Craig was another one of our nannies.
Mia replaced Craig after I fired him.
I told you that a male nanny was not a good idea.
is that why you let Craig go?
Jonah denied that anything ever happened.
but I didn't want the influence around, so I took out a restraining order to keep him away.
I thought you fired Craig because he was flirting with me.
I told you that, because that's what you wanted to hear.
is it possible that Craig thought Vanessa got him fired?
maybe.
but there's no way that Craig could have been in my home this morning without me knowing about me.
with all due respect, Mr. Lambert, but you're not a very good witness.
I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
this is Frank Tripp.
thank you for meeting us. We'd like to ask you a few questions.
mind giving us a few?
that your girlfriend?
you here to ask about my love life?
no. We want to ask you about Vanessa Waters.
she was stabbed to death this morning.
Vanessa? No way that's horrible.
but what's that got to do with me?
I don't know. Why don't you tell us?
that's a pretty nasty cut on your arm.
Oh, that?
got it working at a lumberyard.
families aren't exactly clamoring to hire me, with a restraining order on my record.
I assume you knew about the TRO the Lamberts filed against me.
Yeah, we do. We also know that Vanessa's the reason that you got slapped with it.
what, the gay thing?
Vanessa totally misunderstood.
so nothing happened between you and the Lambert boy?
Dennis Lambert doesn't have the slightest clue about his son.
the kid's not gay.
are you saying that Jonah never said that he loved you?
no, he did...
but like a big brother.
you gotta understand, Dennis was always working.
I - I told Jonah about girls, took him fishing, taught him how to throw a spiral,
stuff dads are supposed to do.
do you blame Vanessa for being fired?
well, if she wasn't such a gossip,
I'd still be working there, if that's what you mean.
so it might feel real good for a little payback, huh?
no way, man.
even though Vanessa was wrong, I know she was just trying to look out for those kids.
maybe so. Who's looking out for her?
did you get something, Mr. Wolfe?
Yeah, actually.
I got to thinking about the footage from the robbery.
and since the thief kicked the hidden camera,
I figured he'd leave something behind.
see, there's a scuff mark right here.
looks like a blade of grass.
it's not even real grass. It's plastic.
you know what I'll do, I'll call around all the party guests and see if anybody had astro turf.
can I help you?
no need, Mr. Wolfe, I have somebody in mind.
we meet again, Mr. Coswell.
Hey, I already gave you guys my fingerprints today at the house.
it's not your fingerprints we're interested in.
no, Mr. Coswell, we want to print your knuckles.
give me a break. That's ridiculous.
actually, it's not.
skin contours and details of your knuckles, they differ from person to person, and even finger to finger.
what, do you got some kind of knuckle database?
no, we don't need one.
I lifted a print off the keypad from the safe.
if I can match that to one of yours, well, we'll be back here with a warrant for your arrest.
so, why don't you save us the trip, Mr. Coswell?
we found some astro turf near the Lamberts' home safe that we believe matches the turf here in your play area.
right, I took a little souvenir from the party.
then what happened? Vanessa saw you what you were doing, and you had to kill her?
no way. She was in on it.
they told you the combination to their safe, right?
no, they told me that in confidence.
I know how many student loans you're carrying, Vanessa.
if you don't do this, I'll make sure you never work again.
I recognized the nanny cam right away.
I'm the one who sold it to Kate.
first, the Lamberts took out a TRO on Craig, then they fired Vanessa.
other families find out, they'd start thinking my agency's the problem.
so you figured the Lamberts owed you.
that's right.
they were going to single-handedly ruin my business.
looks like you beat them to it, doesn't it?
Hey, Ryan.
Hey, Alexx, what you got?
Vanessa waters' tox report.
Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride.
it's an active ingredient in eye drops.
if ingested, it slows down the central nervous system, and that causes oxygen depletion in the blood.
and that explains the blue tint in her fingernail beds.
you know, Ryan, people don't ingest this accidentally.
so what you're saying is that Vanessa was poisoned?
according to her stomach contents, the last meal she had was breakfast this morning.
and Mia Hernandez said she did all the cooking for the family.
then it may be time to check Mia's recipe book.
thank you, Alexx.
Yeah, I made breakfast this morning. So?
so do you want to tell me why you spiced up Vanessa's eggs with tetrahydrozoline?
what? What's that?
that is eye drops.
I got a tox report that confirms it.
you poisoned her.
all right, I admit it.
I put the eye drops in her food.
I thought if Vanessa got sick, then I would get to go on the trip instead of her.
so, uh, let me get this straight.
you poisoned her to go on a vacation?
I didn't do it for me.
I did it for the kids.
that trip could have been the best learning experience for them.
all that Vanessa wanted them to do was have fun.
I don't know, Mia, I gotta be honest with you.
that doesn't sound so...bad.
she only packed iPods and game boys.
what about language guides, maps?
a kid show interest in something, you have to foster it.
Jonah likes swimming, so I bought him a scuba diving kit.
Vanessa got so mad at me.
so you poisoned her.
and when that didn't work, you killed her.
No!
I could never have done that.
I just wanted her out of the picture while we went on our trip.
I'll tell you what's ironic, Mia.
Mrs. Lambert fired Vanessa this morning. - What?
Yeah, you actually, could be going on a vacation, but poisoning someone is a felony.
I don't know what to say.
you could start with saying "I'm sorry," but, uh...
it's a little late for that.
Ryan said that Mia Fernandez bought Jonah a scuba diving kit for his trip.
all diving kits, they have one thing in common: A knife.
a ceramic knife.
ceramic doesn't rust, so it's great for deep-sea dives.
and murder.
you know, Jonah definitely has motive, seeing as Vanessa ratted out his buddy, Craig.
can you imagine raising a family without any help?
I mean, you know, given the hours we work?
Yeah, I could. Definitely.
Really?
Yeah. Why, you don't think I'd be a good dad?
no, I think you'd be a great dad.
I just never heard you mention having children before.
well, maybe when I find the...the right girl.
bingo.
I found Jonah's scuba diving kit.
there's the knife.
ceramic, with a chipped point, just like the murder weapon.
I think it's time that we talked to Jonah.
why am I here?
Jonah, we found a knife in your bedroom that matches the one that killed Vanessa.
what, my - my scuba knife?
I never even used it.
I just got it a couple of days ago.
it has a broken tip.
well, I... can't explain that.
I guess it came that way.
Mia got it for me.
I guess she thought she could replace Craig.
were you angry with Vanessa for getting Craig fired, Jonah?
Yeah, I was.
she gave my dad the totally wrong idea.
okay, help me understand.
I looked up to Craig.
we were friends.
but now, all 'cause of Vanessa, no more football, no more poker, no more go-carts.
just this stupid trip with my stupid family.
is this your way of putting a stop to it?
I didn't kill her.
cr - Craig taught me better than that.
you have to believe me.
I want to.
I really do, son.
Hey. - Hey.
so, do we have a slam dunk on the Lambert kid?
no, it's anything but, unfortunately.
I ran the knife for victim blood; I didn't find any.
as a matter of fact, I didn't find any blood on it at all.
I guess he could have cleaned it.
so, what now?
well, now it's your turn, 'cause Jonah Lambert said he never used that knife.
well, if we can prove he handled it, we catch him in a lie.
think I've got something.
it's not the kid at all.
it's Craig Abbott.
the nanny with the TRO?
he wasn't supposed to be within a hundred feet of that house.
Yeah, well, let's see what other laws he broke.
so, Craig, you lied to us.
it turns out you were at the Lambert house this morning.
and we know this because we recovered your print from Jonah's knife.
you think I killed Vanessa?
I do. Craig, I do.
Jonah had a big test before his trip, and I was a history major.
that's seriously how Trotsky died?
Yeah. Ice pick to the back of the head.
like this...
that's awesome.
you're gonna ace this thing.
Thanks, Craig.
look, you better get out of here.
I'll go downstairs, text you when the coast is clear.
I only lied because of the restraining order.
that's why nobody saw you at the party, right?
there's a balcony upstairs.
the door's always unlocked.
climb the drainpipe and you're there.
and you let yourself in and out.
from: Jonah all clear
I freaked out when I saw Vanessa.
I couldn't wait to get the hell out of there.
you gotta believe me. I didn't do it.
I cut myself sliding on the roof.
stay close.
okay, so this is the door that Craig Abbot snuck out of.
Yeah, and if he had to go out here, so did the killer.
if we find trace from any other person, that's our guy.
Hey. Are you going on the roof? - Yeah.
wait. I don't want you to end up in the hospital.
I'll be fine.
can you tell if anyone's been out there?
maybe not someone... but something.
it's got blood on it.
that's a kid's drawing.
how do you think that got up there?
I don't know. Maybe someone tossed it out that door.
that's odd. Why do you think they'd do that?
because you can't go downstairs with the murder weapon in your hand.
is it ceramic?
Yeah.
Matthew, that is the knife that killed Vanessa Waters.
and that is your fingerprint.
looks like one of ours.
I'm a caterer, remember.
I set all these knives for that party.
in addition, we have this.
some kid's drawing. So what?
this kid's drawing has your fingerprints, too, Matthew, only this time...in blood.
I shuffled my schedule around to work that party - to see Vanessa.
I wasn't prepared to see her with that family.
we broke up because she didn't want to have kids, and then there she was looking like she's having the time of her life.
she was on their payroll, Matthew.
no, no.
it was much more than that.
never thought I'd see the day.
what are you doing here?
it's nice to see you playing with those kids.
well, yeah, she's like family.
Oh... this coming from someone who says she never wanted to have kids.
no, Matt.
I never said that.
I just don't want to have them with you.
I used to dream what it would be like to have a big house, kids running around in the yard.
Vanessa was supposed to be part of that dream.
it's like... she went out, she did all this without me.
I was supposed to be the one in that picture.
but she says I'm not good enough?
it turns out she was right.
take him.
lieutenant.
so the killer's behind bars?
he is.
thought I'd feel more relieved, but...
it just still feels awful.
all this time we spent trying to insure our future...
it's kept us from enjoying our present.
there's still time.
that's why we are going to cancel our trip.
Really?
we're still gonna take some time off.
back home.
just the four of us.
you know, sometimes life gets so crazy it's...
easy to forget your priorities.
Ah, yes.
priorities.
take care, folks.
welcome to Amy's divorce party.
love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy.
it does not boast, it is not proud.
love does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth.
unless, of course, you're talking about Roger Lansing.
we are gathered here today in the presence of friends and family to celebrate my best friend, Amy, and the beginning of her new life.
a life without him.
you ready? - Hell, yes.
please be seated.
do you promise to honor yourself and your independence...
to live life to the fullest without sorrow or hardship...
to live life... to love life... without him?
I do.
then, it is with the utmost joy and...
these signed divorce papers that I symbolically, spiritually and gally remove you from the bonds of this marriage.
ladies and... single gentlemen...
I present to you the newly-divorced Amy Lansing.
thank you.
all right. You ready?
I caught it! I caught it!
Oh, my God! Roger?
it's Roger!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
no one's cut him down yet?
wouldn't have made a difference.
the first and second cervical vertebrae are transected, as is the spinal chord.
death was instantaneous.
the rope's tied with a double-knotted half hitch, positioned under the left ear.
which means it would have been tied by somebody who's right-handed.
he wears his watch on the right hand. He's a lefty-- he didn't tie the noose.
how did someone get him up there in the first place?
I don't know. We're going to have to get up there ourselves and take a look.
you guys make this much of a fuss over every suicide, or just the public ones?
who are you?
uh, Glenn Wagner. Amy's best friend. I threw the party.
well, Mr. Wagner, may I ask you a few questions?
walk with me, if you don't mind.
you are here just in time to explain to me how it's possible that a trapdoor could be in the top of that gazebo.
I don't know.
um, the construction crew was, uh, building it yesterday.
they were using it to get on the roof, so maybe that was it.
and idea how Roger Lanng got up there?
no... I was here all day setting up.
didn't see anything.
don't know how he did it, but I know why.
he just wanted to hurt Amy, ruin her big day.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, babe, come this way. We need an EMT! Here.
have a seat. Are you okay?
Yeah, I think I'm okay-- it just hurts like hell.
let me see.
there goes my DB.
and our crime scene.
you must think I'm pretty...
callous, celebrating my divorce like this.
unless you were celebrating your husband's death.
this party was for me.
you know, just leave it to Roger to try to take that away from me.
Mrs. Lansing, your husband was murdered.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
maybe not now, but it will.
how's Tara?
Oh, she, uh...she aggravated an old shoulder injury, but she's just happy she's not getting stitches.
what did you get?
I found about 20 feet of fishing line attached to the release mechanism on the trapdoor, so it was definitely rigged for our victim.
do you think that it was also rigged to come down?
I doubt it.
I think it just probably wasn't designed to hold the weight of a hanging body.
whoever it was that pulled the release mechanism would have had to have been close...
as in 20 feet close.
well, I think we can recreate the crime scene using photos taken by the witnesses.
I confiscated almost all the cameras.
great. - I'll get it to the lab.
mom, come on! You have to be up for this.
Kyle, I'm fine. Just drive.
look, at least drink the coffee I bought you. - I don't need it.
look, you're never going to make it through an interview like this.
just get me there. Drive faster.
gosh darn it.
I told him to be more careful.
he was supposed to wake me up this morning for my job interview, and he overslept.
Julia, it is not his responsibility to get you there.
Oh, so now I get a lecture from you on parenting?
hang on a second. - I'm doing my best.
no. What I am saying is, what happened this morning endangered more than one life.
what do you want from me?
I want you to be more careful with him.
I'm a good mother. I'll take care of him.
I'm gog to help you, okay?
dad, what are we doing here?
your driving could have gotten somebody killed this morning, Kyle.
I know.
I'm not sure you do.
actions have consequences, son.
here name is Stephanie Vasquez. She was killed in a car accident this morning.
I get it, Dad. I really do. - Do you?
well, this is your chance to prove it. Dr. Price.
hello. You must be my new intern.
dad, what is she talking about?
you work here now, son. And she's your boss. See you at lunch.
thank you, Doctor.
Mr. Wagner, we recovered your DNA.
this is so much more intimidating than I thought it would be.
not you.
it was on the fishing line you pulled to trigger that trap door.
which was rigged to hang Roger Lansing.
you ready?
I caught it! I caught it!
I rigged the door, but it was to hang Roger in effigy, not reality.
good likeness, too.
I had no idea it would be the real... dummy.
you were gonna hang a replica of the victim?
it was supposed to be the piece de resistance for the party.
a surprise for Amy.
why didn't you mention this before?
because, as you so astutely pointed out, I rigged the thing.
unfortunately, we haven't found any lost effigies running around town, so you're looking pretty good for this.
obviously, the killer took it.
look, I didn't like Roger for the way he treated Amy, but I didn't kill him.
you know, I think you're in love with Amy.
this whole gay thing's not working for me.
believe me, honey, I'm not that good an actor.
no, but you may be that good a killer.
just so you know...
when you get sick, remember, it happens to everyonetheir first time.
I'll be fine.
that's exactly what I said.
what are you gonna do with that?
this goes up to Trace and DNA for testing.
so, what, this guy hanged himself?
the rule around here is that we never take anything at face value.
for instance, you see that body over there?
Stephanie Vasquez? The car crash? - Yeah.
her test results indite she overdosed on Oxycodone, lost consciousness, and died at the wheel.
we never would have known that had we assumed she died because of the crash.
so, what? I mean, is there something weird like that about this guy?
well, we're going to find out. Give me a hand?
he's dead. He won't mind if you just grab it and turn his head.
other side.
good job.
if there are any volatiles in the blood, the heat will cause them to be vaporized into gas form and... rise...
into the headspace of the vial.
the G. C.will break up the compounds of the sample, and the flame ionization detector ionizes the molecules, creating a current for analysis.
confirmation.
Roger Lansing's hanging was definitely not his idea.
he was chloroformed.
there's nothing on his shoes that indicates he was dragged to the scene.
so he went there willingly. - Yeah.
and he was drugged and prepared for his execution.
which leaves only one thing.
who was his executioner?
Hey, man.
I was able to stitch together a virtual view based on all the photos from before and after the hanging.
God, Dave, what has taken you so long? What's the matter?
is the learning curve too steep for you?
I don't want to give you a complex. I learned the whole thing in, like, one day.
nice. Picking on the new guy. - That's right.
do you know how long it takes to render a 3-D image like this?
Oh, God, do I. Thank God you're here.
we can move around the environment, like so.
sorry for the synthy view, but the image details are gonna change somewhat - depending on the photos we pull up to fill in the blanks. - Okay.
can you show us the ceiling of the canopy?
you just pointed out our one limitation, my man.
if it wasn't photographed, it doesn't exist here.
besides, I thought Glenn Wagner already admitted to this.
well, he didn't know that Roger Lansing was up there, but, uh...
somebody did. - So we're looking for someone suspicious?
Yeah.
what about somebody that looks out of place?
you see this kid over here in the corner in the background? Near the canopy?
I can't really make out his face. Can you get any closer?
no, but it looks like he's moving away from the canopy, so maybe I can trace his steps.
can we push through the crowd?
if the information's there.
he's not out of place. That's Heath Lansing.
that's the Lansings' son.
he was at his mom's divorce party?
now, that could mess a kid up.
I don't know.
I wasn't even at that stupid party. I was working.
where do you work?
around the neighborhood. I clean pools.
I was at the Slausons' house, but they weren't home.
so that probably would make it pretty easy for you to sak around other people's backyards and get back to your own.
I wanted to see it for myself.
that ridiculous show she was putting on.
your mom?
I mean, she was in our backyard trashing my dad.
she didn't even ask me about it. She didn't.
and you didn't know his body was on top of the canopy?
of course not. Why would I?
when was the last time you saw him?
um, a couple of days ago.
he wasn't taking the divorce well.
he was spending all of his time at work.
Where'd he work?
I don't know.
you don't know where your own father worked?
um, we weren't allowed to talk about it.
all he said was that it was for the government, and that it was important.
even my mom couldn't know about it. It was a secret.
but... if he was... a spy...
you guys don't think that somebody got to him, do you?
well, let's just take things one step at a time, but as soon as we find out anything, we'll let you know.
okay.
man, that poor kid.
he doesn't even know where to start looking for answers.
I do. The IRS.
they'll have Roger's work address. Let's get it.
Roger Lansing's tax records reflect this address.
I don't know a Roger Lansing.
I rent this out to a guy named Trent Faber.
guess he's got some kind of sublet situation going on.
Yeah, or maybe a business partner.
either way, he owes me some money.
shareholder reports.
looks like Trent Faber bought and sold 300 shares of Hayton Electronics on Friday alone.
and a thousand of Flintport, Incorporated.
sounds like day trading.
looks like Roger and this guy, uh, Trent keep very busy calendars.
you know, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this doesn't look like the home office of a spy.
why would you lie to your family about your job?
I don't know. Let's ask the partner.
ma'am... we're looking for Trent Faber.
he's not here. Can I help you?
we have some questions about his business partner, Roger Lansing.
Trent doesn't have a business partner. Is something wrong?
Mr. Lansing was found murdered this morning.
well, Trent left very early this morning for work.
and that was to his office on Flagler? - Yes.
he's a stockbroker? - Yes. Is Trent okay?
mom, I'm going to be late. Let's go.
I'm sorry, I'm running late, and I have to drop her off.
can I have Trent call you tonight when he gets home?
I need to speak to him right now, ma'am.
Hello? - Kyle?
dad, is that you?
Kyle, where are you?
I'm in Autopsy.
who's Kyle? - Okay. Whose phone is this?
Roger Lansing, the victim. - Stay where you are
is that not Trent? What's going on?
Mrs. Faber, is this your husband?
Oh, my God, that's Trent.
we know him as Roger Lansing, ma'am.
I-I... I don't un-understand. - Could we come inside, please?
I thought Dr. Price instructed you not to tamper with evidence.
Yeah, I know, okay? But it could have been the guy's killer.
son, that is not the job.
look, I don't see what the big deal is.
Kyle, a murder investigation is a very big deal.
look, if I would have never answered that phone you guys would have never...
don't do it again, you understand?
do you know anyone who would want to hurt your husband?
no one.
I never saw my husband even raise his voice to another person.
what about Trent's business?
was there anything that you found to be unusual or suspicious?
I don't know. He traveled a lot.
we weren't supposed to talk about his work.
I knew it was for the government.
so he was gone a lot?
he missed Christmas.
he always made it home for Christmas.
we were married on the 26th, so it was also our anniversary.
how long were you married? - 19 years.
would've been 17 years, if I hadn't filed for divorce.
after Brianna was born, Trent got depressed.
I think he really wanted a son.
when Heath was born, he said his life was complete.
I think your husband's life was more than complete.
he was living a double life.
what am I looking at?
I'm-I'm sorry, I-I just I can't believe this.
Roger was married to another woman at the time he married you.
we thi that Trent may have used his company as his cover.
saying that he was going away for business, when he was really going to be with his other family.
now if you found out about this you would understandably be very upset.
you think I killed him?
we are merely examining all of the possibilities.
we found plant fertilizer on the noose that was around your husband's neck.
now, I know that you have a very extensive flower garden in your front yard.
that doesn't mean anything.
if you would just allow me to test your hands, just to be sure, we could eliminate you as a suspect.
please place your hands on the piece of paper.
what's this?
it's an explosives detection kit.
explosives? I thought Trent was hanged.
he was, but we found ammonium nitrate on theoose.
ammonium nitrate is the common ingredient in explosives, as well as plant fertilizer.
and you have it underneath your fingernails.
just because I use fertilizer doesn't make me a killer.
what about this other woman? Is she a suspect?
why would I kill him?
you kill the cheating husband, frame the other wife.
it's the perfect revenge plan.
Yeah, I've never met this "other wife," so why would I frame her?
you know what? - You know what?
I want to talk to my lawyer. - I want to talk to my lawyer.
I had a second, and I figured I'd stop in and check on the wood lattice-work we collected.
you got anything?
no. I was actually about to run a rush process on thetephanie Vasquez case, but I seem to be missing a pill phial.
and it's logged in, it just isn't with the other personal effects.
Yeah, that's odd. Maybe there's a problem down in Autopsy.
I'll have to inquire.
fortunate news for you, though: I can procesthe wood from the canopy next.
all right, I'll, uh, be back in a little while. Thanks, Travers.
you wanted to see me, Lieutenant?
the current case that you have in Autopsy.
the Lansing/Faber mess? - No.
the Stephanie Vasquez case.
the girl who overdosed.
her personal effects indicate a bottle of medication.
Yeah, I logged it myself.
it never made it to the lab.
that's impossible.
I put it in the box with everything else to be sent upstairs.
I mean, the bottle was with everything else. - Who else had access to it?
my assistants, but... I can trust them.
they wouldn't steal evidence. - Who else?
I didn't want to say anying because it was his first day...
Kyle. - Mom!
but Kyle did have a visitor.
his mother stopped by.
you know, you probably... probably shouldn't be down here.
Oh, um, I'll let you get back to work. - Okay.
I don't know how long she was there.
I'll te care of him.
thank you.
so you visited Kyle today.
Yeah. I wasn't aware I needed permission.
Julia, some medication went missing from that lab.
look, I know where you're going, and I don't appreciate the accusation.
the suspicion is going to fall onto the boy.
he would never do anything to jeopardize this opportunity.
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
there's going to be an investigation.
no, there n't, because I know he didn't do it, and so do you.
it is time to let him go.
anything else? - I think you heard me.
heard Amy and Katherine lawyered up. - Yep.
till we get something more concrete, we can't hold them.
this is more mud than concrete, but it might stick.
I looked into Amy's Motor Vehicle record.
this picture was taken six months ago when she ran a red light.
that's less than two blocks away from the Faber residence. - Yeah.
you think she knows more than she's letting on?
I don't know. I'll invite her back in.
all right. - Thanks.
Amy, I suspect that you knew about your husband's relationship with Katherine Faber.
no, I just found out about her from you.
are you sure about that?
okay. About six months ago I received a delivery-- chocolate and white wine.
not my favorite; I figure Roger's being romantic.
the card said: Katherine, I miss you. I love you.
it was in his handwriting.
so you thought he was cheating on you.
well, the next time Roger left on one of his "business trips," I followed him.
you realize she lives ten minutes from me!
was that the only time that you had been to the Faber residence?
no, I-I had to find out who she was.
I went back a week later to get a look at her.
excuse me?
I'm so sorry to bother you.
um, my cell phone just died, and I'm supposed to show a house like right now, and I'm so lost. May I use your phone?
Yes, absolutely. - Thanks.
I-I thought I would find some fake plastic bimbo.
I mean, clearly we ran in different social circles.
you and your husband?
Mmm, that's my Trent.
pretty couple. Trent.
I can understand.
did it make you angry enough to kill him?
no. I confronted him.
you had a wife all this time?
Amy, listen to me. You are my wife, you're my real wife.
I was never your real wife. You married her before me.
for God's sake, Roger, you have a daughter!
listen to me...
do you know what kind of laws that you've broken?
Amy, think about Heath.
Oh, yeah, I have.
so for his sake, I will keep quiet about this, but you are gonna give me a divorce and the alimony that I want.
I swear to God, I will give you whatever you want.
just please don't tell her. Please don't tell my other family.
a spy, Roger? God!
but you didn't take it any further?
take what further?
Mrs. Lansing, you've been to the Faber residence.
it would have been very easy to steal evidence.
you could have grabbed a handful of fertilizer, used it to set up Katherine.
I didn't grab anything.
I-I wanted to forget about her.
besides, if I killed Roger, I'd get nothing.
why would I do that?
hell hath no fury, Mrs. Lansing.
please...
I think Roger's killer did, in fact, use this to gain access to the roof.
this ran up the side of the canopy? - Exactly.
I get the feeling you're on to something. - I am.
a substance...
along the edges of the wood...
all the way to the top.
killer used it like a ladder.
mass spec determined it was dimethyl ketone.
dimethyl ketone. That's acetone.
that's not consistent with anything else we've found.
actually, acetone could be used to make homemade chloroform.
homemade.
could be done with a modest understanding of chemistry.
also, acetone is highly tenacious.
if it was handled recently, residue would still be present on the handler.
Yeah, homemade chloroform. That, uh...
that means we're not done with our widows, after all.
not this again. Haven't we done this already?
Mrs. Faber, can you please hold out your hands?
is that other woman being tested, too?
she was. Amy tested negative.
she's clean. - Mom?
what are you testing for?
acetone. It's a common chemical that's found in glass cleaners, nail polish remover.
mom, what's going on here? Is this about Dad?
nothing, baby. It's just a misunderstanding.
are we finished here?
I obviously need some alone time with my daughter.
Yeah. Ryan, can you do me a favor? Check the daughter's hands, please.
mom? - Can I see your hands, please?
brie, it's okay, show them your hands.
we've got a hit.
I was doing my nails.
I spilsome.
we've got some over here, too.
I told you, I was doing my nails and it spilt. What's the big deal?
the big deal is that whoever killed your father used acetone to make chloroform.
Eric, do me a favor, close the drapes.
you don't spill this much acetone doing your nails, Brie.
Wh-What's... what's going on here?
whoever subdued your husband mixed the chloroform in this room.
what have you done? - Nothing. I didn't mix anything.
Mrs. Faber, we're going to have to take your daughter into custody for questioning.
Brianna? - Mom?
mom, I didn't do anything.
mom, you can't honestly believe 'em.
Hey, Brianna Faber popped positive for both the fertilizer on the noose and the acetone on the canopy.
mom, I'm going to meet Dakota at the mall.
don't be gone long. I need your help around here. - Okay.
there's no traces of chloroform, which doesn't add up, but Travers did find high concentrations of sodium hyperchlorite.
liquid chlorine is the other ingredient in homemade chloroform, Eric.
Yeah. Well, we narrowed it down to a brand of pool cleaner called Chlor-Shock.
but, uh, the Fabers don't have a pool, and neither do the Lansings.
wait a second. But Heath Lansing is a pool cleaner, isn't he?
Yeah, so Heath has access to the chlorine. Brianna brings the acetone.
you think the victim's two kids knew each other?
there's only one way to find out. Bring 'em in.
all right.
I'd make introductions, but it's clear the two of you know each other.
Brianna, have a seat.
so, how did you two meet?
um, at some party Kurt Blakefield was throwing, about two months ago.
we were wearing the same Chuck Taylors.
we didn't know about each other-- that we were related.
all right, but you found out.
and when you did, you realized that your father had betrayed both families, - so you decided to kill him. - No.
we found the nail polish remover you used, Brianna.
and Heath, we know that you supplied the pool cleaner, with the necessary chlorine to make the chloroform.
no. No. No. No. I-I-I did it. - Heath.
no, she had nothing to do with it. I made the chloroform myself.
the evidence tells us that you were at her house.
all right, we know you did it together.
do you want to tell us why you did it?
the baby is yours?
it's ours.
it was one night, but... we love each other.
we found out about our dad after she got pregnant.
when I went to meet her after school, I... saw her with my dad.
he was supposed to be abroad for his work.
another one of his lies.
we confronted him, and we told him about us-- about the baby.
you two can't be together! It's-it's not natural.
it's not natural? Having two families isn't natural.
we're in love, and we're having this baby.
it's wrong, honey. - What you did was wrong.
we did what we had to do. To protect our baby.
Heath... what's so important I had to come across town?
you know your mother doesn't want me around.
I saw Glenn put this thing up here.
it's dressed in your clothes, Dad. You gotta see it.
your mother has gone too far. - Yeah, see?
we couldn't let him ruin another life.
what kind of a life do you think your baby's going to have with the two of you in prison?
at least he'll be alive.
Hey, Kyle. What's going on?
I'm sorry about what happened with my mom.
you don't have to worry about her coming around here anymore.
probably not going to be needing these.
Kyle, you... you had a rough first day, but you made it.
I never figured you for a quitter.
so are you saying I still have the job?
I only want people who want to be here.
tomorrow, 8: 00 sharp.
I promise I won't let you down.
you're going to need these.
what are we doing here? I thought we were meeting at home.
you are home. You live here now, Kyle.
a new job with my own apartment? Sweet!
but with them comes responsibility, right?
I know. - Right?
Yeah, I know.
can I check it out? - Sure.
Hey, Kyle...
welcome to Amy's divorce party.
love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy.
it does not boast, it is not proud.
love does not delight in evil, but rejoices in the truth.
unless, of course, you're talking about Roger Lansing.
we are gathered here today in the presence of friends and family to celebrate my best friend, Amy, and the beginning of her new life.
a life without him.
you ready? - Hell, yes.
please be seated.
do you promise to honor yourself and your independence...
to live life to the fullest without sorrow or hardship...
to live life... to love life... without him?
I do.
then, it is with the utmost joy and...
these signed divorce papers that I symbolically, spiritually and gally remove you from the bonds of this marriage.
ladies and... single gentlemen...
I present to you the newly-divorced Amy Lansing.
thank you.
all right. You ready?
I caught it! I caught it!
Oh, my God! Roger?
it's Roger!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
no one's cut him down yet?
wouldn't have made a difference.
the first and second cervical vertebrae are transected, as is the spinal chord.
death was instantaneous.
the rope's tied with a double-knotted half hitch, positioned under the left ear.
which means it would have been tied by somebody who's right-handed.
he wears his watch on the right hand. He's a lefty-- he didn't tie the noose.
how did someone get him up there in the first place?
I don't know. We're going to have to get up there ourselves and take a look.
you guys make this much of a fuss over every suicide, or just the public ones?
who are you?
uh, Glenn Wagner. Amy's best friend. I threw the party.
well, Mr. Wagner, may I ask you a few questions?
walk with me, if you don't mind.
you are here just in time to explain to me how it's possible that a trapdoor could be in the top of that gazebo.
I don't know.
um, the construction crew was, uh, building it yesterday.
they were using it to get on the roof, so maybe that was it.
and idea how Roger Lanng got up there?
no... I was here all day setting up.
didn't see anything.
don't know how he did it, but I know why.
he just wanted to hurt Amy, ruin her big day.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, babe, come this way. We need an EMT! Here.
have a seat. Are you okay?
Yeah, I think I'm okay-- it just hurts like hell.
let me see.
there goes my DB.
and our crime scene.
you must think I'm pretty...
callous, celebrating my divorce like this.
unless you were celebrating your husband's death.
this party was for me.
you know, just leave it to Roger to try to take that away from me.
Mrs. Lansing, your husband was murdered.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
maybe not now, but it will.
how's Tara?
Oh, she, uh...she aggravated an old shoulder injury, but she's just happy she's not getting stitches.
what did you get?
I found about 20 feet of fishing line attached to the release mechanism on the trapdoor, so it was definitely rigged for our victim.
do you think that it was also rigged to come down?
I doubt it.
I think it just probably wasn't designed to hold the weight of a hanging body.
whoever it was that pulled the release mechanism would have had to have been close...
as in 20 feet close.
well, I think we can recreate the crime scene using photos taken by the witnesses.
I confiscated almost all the cameras.
great. - I'll get it to the lab.
mom, come on! You have to be up for this.
Kyle, I'm fine. Just drive.
look, at least drink the coffee I bought you. - I don't need it.
look, you're never going to make it through an interview like this.
just get me there. Drive faster.
gosh darn it.
I told him to be more careful.
he was supposed to wake me up this morning for my job interview, and he overslept.
Julia, it is not his responsibility to get you there.
Oh, so now I get a lecture from you on parenting?
hang on a second. - I'm doing my best.
no. What I am saying is, what happened this morning endangered more than one life.
what do you want from me?
I want you to be more careful with him.
I'm a good mother. I'll take care of him.
I'm gog to help you, okay?
dad, what are we doing here?
your driving could have gotten somebody killed this morning, Kyle.
I know.
I'm not sure you do.
actions have consequences, son.
here name is Stephanie Vasquez. She was killed in a car accident this morning.
I get it, Dad. I really do. - Do you?
well, this is your chance to prove it. Dr. Price.
hello. You must be my new intern.
dad, what is she talking about?
you work here now, son. And she's your boss. See you at lunch.
thank you, Doctor.
Mr. Wagner, we recovered your DNA.
this is so much more intimidating than I thought it would be.
not you.
it was on the fishing line you pulled to trigger that trap door.
which was rigged to hang Roger Lansing.
you ready?
I caught it! I caught it!
I rigged the door, but it was to hang Roger in effigy, not reality.
good likeness, too.
I had no idea it would be the real... dummy.
you were gonna hang a replica of the victim?
it was supposed to be the piece de resistance for the party.
a surprise for Amy.
why didn't you mention this before?
because, as you so astutely pointed out, I rigged the thing.
unfortunately, we haven't found any lost effigies running around town, so you're looking pretty good for this.
obviously, the killer took it.
look, I didn't like Roger for the way he treated Amy, but I didn't kill him.
you know, I think you're in love with Amy.
this whole gay thing's not working for me.
believe me, honey, I'm not that good an actor.
no, but you may be that good a killer.
just so you know...
when you get sick, remember, it happens to everyonetheir first time.
I'll be fine.
that's exactly what I said.
what are you gonna do with that?
this goes up to Trace and DNA for testing.
so, what, this guy hanged himself?
the rule around here is that we never take anything at face value.
for instance, you see that body over there?
Stephanie Vasquez? The car crash? - Yeah.
her test results indite she overdosed on Oxycodone, lost consciousness, and died at the wheel.
we never would have known that had we assumed she died because of the crash.
so, what? I mean, is there something weird like that about this guy?
well, we're going to find out. Give me a hand?
he's dead. He won't mind if you just grab it and turn his head.
other side.
good job.
if there are any volatiles in the blood, the heat will cause them to be vaporized into gas form and... rise...
into the headspace of the vial.
the G. C.will break up the compounds of the sample, and the flame ionization detector ionizes the molecules, creating a current for analysis.
confirmation.
Roger Lansing's hanging was definitely not his idea.
he was chloroformed.
there's nothing on his shoes that indicates he was dragged to the scene.
so he went there willingly. - Yeah.
and he was drugged and prepared for his execution.
which leaves only one thing.
who was his executioner?
Hey, man.
I was able to stitch together a virtual view based on all the photos from before and after the hanging.
God, Dave, what has taken you so long? What's the matter?
is the learning curve too steep for you?
I don't want to give you a complex. I learned the whole thing in, like, one day.
nice. Picking on the new guy. - That's right.
do you know how long it takes to render a 3-D image like this?
Oh, God, do I. Thank God you're here.
we can move around the environment, like so.
sorry for the synthy view, but the image details are gonna change somewhat - depending on the photos we pull up to fill in the blanks. - Okay.
can you show us the ceiling of the canopy?
you just pointed out our one limitation, my man.
if it wasn't photographed, it doesn't exist here.
besides, I thought Glenn Wagner already admitted to this.
well, he didn't know that Roger Lansing was up there, but, uh...
somebody did. - So we're looking for someone suspicious?
Yeah.
what about somebody that looks out of place?
you see this kid over here in the corner in the background? Near the canopy?
I can't really make out his face. Can you get any closer?
no, but it looks like he's moving away from the canopy, so maybe I can trace his steps.
can we push through the crowd?
if the information's there.
he's not out of place. That's Heath Lansing.
that's the Lansings' son.
he was at his mom's divorce party?
now, that could mess a kid up.
I don't know.
I wasn't even at that stupid party. I was working.
where do you work?
around the neighborhood. I clean pools.
I was at the Slausons' house, but they weren't home.
so that probably would make it pretty easy for you to sak around other people's backyards and get back to your own.
I wanted to see it for myself.
that ridiculous show she was putting on.
your mom?
I mean, she was in our backyard trashing my dad.
she didn't even ask me about it. She didn't.
and you didn't know his body was on top of the canopy?
of course not. Why would I?
when was the last time you saw him?
um, a couple of days ago.
he wasn't taking the divorce well.
he was spending all of his time at work.
Where'd he work?
I don't know.
you don't know where your own father worked?
um, we weren't allowed to talk about it.
all he said was that it was for the government, and that it was important.
even my mom couldn't know about it. It was a secret.
but... if he was... a spy...
you guys don't think that somebody got to him, do you?
well, let's just take things one step at a time, but as soon as we find out anything, we'll let you know.
okay.
man, that poor kid.
he doesn't even know where to start looking for answers.
I do. The IRS.
they'll have Roger's work address. Let's get it.
Roger Lansing's tax records reflect this address.
I don't know a Roger Lansing.
I rent this out to a guy named Trent Faber.
guess he's got some kind of sublet situation going on.
Yeah, or maybe a business partner.
either way, he owes me some money.
shareholder reports.
looks like Trent Faber bought and sold 300 shares of Hayton Electronics on Friday alone.
and a thousand of Flintport, Incorporated.
sounds like day trading.
looks like Roger and this guy, uh, Trent keep very busy calendars.
you know, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this doesn't look like the home office of a spy.
why would you lie to your family about your job?
I don't know. Let's ask the partner.
ma'am... we're looking for Trent Faber.
he's not here. Can I help you?
we have some questions about his business partner, Roger Lansing.
Trent doesn't have a business partner. Is something wrong?
Mr. Lansing was found murdered this morning.
well, Trent left very early this morning for work.
and that was to his office on Flagler? - Yes.
he's a stockbroker? - Yes. Is Trent okay?
mom, I'm going to be late. Let's go.
I'm sorry, I'm running late, and I have to drop her off.
can I have Trent call you tonight when he gets home?
I need to speak to him right now, ma'am.
Hello? - Kyle?
dad, is that you?
Kyle, where are you?
I'm in Autopsy.
who's Kyle? - Okay. Whose phone is this?
Roger Lansing, the victim. - Stay where you are
is that not Trent? What's going on?
Mrs. Faber, is this your husband?
Oh, my God, that's Trent.
we know him as Roger Lansing, ma'am.
I-I... I don't un-understand. - Could we come inside, please?
I thought Dr. Price instructed you not to tamper with evidence.
Yeah, I know, okay? But it could have been the guy's killer.
son, that is not the job.
look, I don't see what the big deal is.
Kyle, a murder investigation is a very big deal.
look, if I would have never answered that phone you guys would have never...
don't do it again, you understand?
do you know anyone who would want to hurt your husband?
no one.
I never saw my husband even raise his voice to another person.
what about Trent's business?
was there anything that you found to be unusual or suspicious?
I don't know. He traveled a lot.
we weren't supposed to talk about his work.
I knew it was for the government.
so he was gone a lot?
he missed Christmas.
he always made it home for Christmas.
we were married on the 26th, so it was also our anniversary.
how long were you married? - 19 years.
would've been 17 years, if I hadn't filed for divorce.
after Brianna was born, Trent got depressed.
I think he really wanted a son.
when Heath was born, he said his life was complete.
I think your husband's life was more than complete.
he was living a double life.
what am I looking at?
I'm-I'm sorry, I-I just I can't believe this.
Roger was married to another woman at the time he married you.
we thi that Trent may have used his company as his cover.
saying that he was going away for business, when he was really going to be with his other family.
now if you found out about this you would understandably be very upset.
you think I killed him?
we are merely examining all of the possibilities.
we found plant fertilizer on the noose that was around your husband's neck.
now, I know that you have a very extensive flower garden in your front yard.
that doesn't mean anything.
if you would just allow me to test your hands, just to be sure, we could eliminate you as a suspect.
please place your hands on the piece of paper.
what's this?
it's an explosives detection kit.
explosives? I thought Trent was hanged.
he was, but we found ammonium nitrate on theoose.
ammonium nitrate is the common ingredient in explosives, as well as plant fertilizer.
and you have it underneath your fingernails.
just because I use fertilizer doesn't make me a killer.
what about this other woman? Is she a suspect?
why would I kill him?
you kill the cheating husband, frame the other wife.
it's the perfect revenge plan.
Yeah, I've never met this "other wife," so why would I frame her?
you know what? - You know what?
I want to talk to my lawyer. - I want to talk to my lawyer.
I had a second, and I figured I'd stop in and check on the wood lattice-work we collected.
you got anything?
no. I was actually about to run a rush process on thetephanie Vasquez case, but I seem to be missing a pill phial.
and it's logged in, it just isn't with the other personal effects.
Yeah, that's odd. Maybe there's a problem down in Autopsy.
I'll have to inquire.
fortunate news for you, though: I can procesthe wood from the canopy next.
all right, I'll, uh, be back in a little while. Thanks, Travers.
you wanted to see me, Lieutenant?
the current case that you have in Autopsy.
the Lansing/Faber mess? - No.
the Stephanie Vasquez case.
the girl who overdosed.
her personal effects indicate a bottle of medication.
Yeah, I logged it myself.
it never made it to the lab.
that's impossible.
I put it in the box with everything else to be sent upstairs.
I mean, the bottle was with everything else. - Who else had access to it?
my assistants, but... I can trust them.
they wouldn't steal evidence. - Who else?
I didn't want to say anying because it was his first day...
Kyle. - Mom!
but Kyle did have a visitor.
his mother stopped by.
you know, you probably... probably shouldn't be down here.
Oh, um, I'll let you get back to work. - Okay.
I don't know how long she was there.
I'll te care of him.
thank you.
so you visited Kyle today.
Yeah. I wasn't aware I needed permission.
Julia, some medication went missing from that lab.
look, I know where you're going, and I don't appreciate the accusation.
the suspicion is going to fall onto the boy.
he would never do anything to jeopardize this opportunity.
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
there's going to be an investigation.
no, there n't, because I know he didn't do it, and so do you.
it is time to let him go.
anything else? - I think you heard me.
heard Amy and Katherine lawyered up. - Yep.
till we get something more concrete, we can't hold them.
this is more mud than concrete, but it might stick.
I looked into Amy's Motor Vehicle record.
this picture was taken six months ago when she ran a red light.
that's less than two blocks away from the Faber residence. - Yeah.
you think she knows more than she's letting on?
I don't know. I'll invite her back in.
all right. - Thanks.
Amy, I suspect that you knew about your husband's relationship with Katherine Faber.
no, I just found out about her from you.
are you sure about that?
okay. About six months ago I received a delivery-- chocolate and white wine.
not my favorite; I figure Roger's being romantic.
the card said: Katherine, I miss you. I love you.
it was in his handwriting.
so you thought he was cheating on you.
well, the next time Roger left on one of his "business trips," I followed him.
you realize she lives ten minutes from me!
was that the only time that you had been to the Faber residence?
no, I-I had to find out who she was.
I went back a week later to get a look at her.
excuse me?
I'm so sorry to bother you.
um, my cell phone just died, and I'm supposed to show a house like right now, and I'm so lost. May I use your phone?
Yes, absolutely. - Thanks.
I-I thought I would find some fake plastic bimbo.
I mean, clearly we ran in different social circles.
you and your husband?
Mmm, that's my Trent.
pretty couple. Trent.
I can understand.
did it make you angry enough to kill him?
no. I confronted him.
you had a wife all this time?
Amy, listen to me. You are my wife, you're my real wife.
I was never your real wife. You married her before me.
for God's sake, Roger, you have a daughter!
listen to me...
do you know what kind of laws that you've broken?
Amy, think about Heath.
Oh, yeah, I have.
so for his sake, I will keep quiet about this, but you are gonna give me a divorce and the alimony that I want.
I swear to God, I will give you whatever you want.
just please don't tell her. Please don't tell my other family.
a spy, Roger? God!
but you didn't take it any further?
take what further?
Mrs. Lansing, you've been to the Faber residence.
it would have been very easy to steal evidence.
you could have grabbed a handful of fertilizer, used it to set up Katherine.
I didn't grab anything.
I-I wanted to forget about her.
besides, if I killed Roger, I'd get nothing.
why would I do that?
hell hath no fury, Mrs. Lansing.
please...
I think Roger's killer did, in fact, use this to gain access to the roof.
this ran up the side of the canopy? - Exactly.
I get the feeling you're on to something. - I am.
a substance...
along the edges of the wood...
all the way to the top.
killer used it like a ladder.
mass spec determined it was dimethyl ketone.
dimethyl ketone. That's acetone.
that's not consistent with anything else we've found.
actually, acetone could be used to make homemade chloroform.
homemade.
could be done with a modest understanding of chemistry.
also, acetone is highly tenacious.
if it was handled recently, residue would still be present on the handler.
Yeah, homemade chloroform. That, uh...
that means we're not done with our widows, after all.
not this again. Haven't we done this already?
Mrs. Faber, can you please hold out your hands?
is that other woman being tested, too?
she was. Amy tested negative.
she's clean. - Mom?
what are you testing for?
acetone. It's a common chemical that's found in glass cleaners, nail polish remover.
mom, what's going on here? Is this about Dad?
nothing, baby. It's just a misunderstanding.
are we finished here?
I obviously need some alone time with my daughter.
Yeah. Ryan, can you do me a favor? Check the daughter's hands, please.
mom? - Can I see your hands, please?
brie, it's okay, show them your hands.
we've got a hit.
I was doing my nails.
I spilsome.
we've got some over here, too.
I told you, I was doing my nails and it spilt. What's the big deal?
the big deal is that whoever killed your father used acetone to make chloroform.
Eric, do me a favor, close the drapes.
you don't spill this much acetone doing your nails, Brie.
Wh-What's... what's going on here?
whoever subdued your husband mixed the chloroform in this room.
what have you done? - Nothing. I didn't mix anything.
Mrs. Faber, we're going to have to take your daughter into custody for questioning.
Brianna? - Mom?
mom, I didn't do anything.
mom, you can't honestly believe 'em.
Hey, Brianna Faber popped positive for both the fertilizer on the noose and the acetone on the canopy.
mom, I'm going to meet Dakota at the mall.
don't be gone long. I need your help around here. - Okay.
there's no traces of chloroform, which doesn't add up, but Travers did find high concentrations of sodium hyperchlorite.
liquid chlorine is the other ingredient in homemade chloroform, Eric.
Yeah. Well, we narrowed it down to a brand of pool cleaner called Chlor-Shock.
but, uh, the Fabers don't have a pool, and neither do the Lansings.
wait a second. But Heath Lansing is a pool cleaner, isn't he?
Yeah, so Heath has access to the chlorine. Brianna brings the acetone.
you think the victim's two kids knew each other?
there's only one way to find out. Bring 'em in.
all right.
I'd make introductions, but it's clear the two of you know each other.
Brianna, have a seat.
so, how did you two meet?
um, at some party Kurt Blakefield was throwing, about two months ago.
we were wearing the same Chuck Taylors.
we didn't know about each other-- that we were related.
all right, but you found out.
and when you did, you realized that your father had betrayed both families, - so you decided to kill him. - No.
we found the nail polish remover you used, Brianna.
and Heath, we know that you supplied the pool cleaner, with the necessary chlorine to make the chloroform.
no. No. No. No. I-I-I did it. - Heath.
no, she had nothing to do with it. I made the chloroform myself.
the evidence tells us that you were at her house.
all right, we know you did it together.
do you want to tell us why you did it?
the baby is yours?
it's ours.
it was one night, but... we love each other.
we found out about our dad after she got pregnant.
when I went to meet her after school, I... saw her with my dad.
he was supposed to be abroad for his work.
another one of his lies.
we confronted him, and we told him about us-- about the baby.
you two can't be together! It's-it's not natural.
it's not natural? Having two families isn't natural.
we're in love, and we're having this baby.
it's wrong, honey. - What you did was wrong.
we did what we had to do. To protect our baby.
Heath... what's so important I had to come across town?
you know your mother doesn't want me around.
I saw Glenn put this thing up here.
it's dressed in your clothes, Dad. You gotta see it.
your mother has gone too far. - Yeah, see?
we couldn't let him ruin another life.
what kind of a life do you think your baby's going to have with the two of you in prison?
at least he'll be alive.
Hey, Kyle. What's going on?
I'm sorry about what happened with my mom.
you don't have to worry about her coming around here anymore.
probably not going to be needing these.
Kyle, you... you had a rough first day, but you made it.
I never figured you for a quitter.
so are you saying I still have the job?
I only want people who want to be here.
tomorrow, 8: 00 sharp.
I promise I won't let you down.
you're going to need these.
what are we doing here? I thought we were meeting at home.
you are home. You live here now, Kyle.
a new job with my own apartment? Sweet!
but with them comes responsibility, right?
I know. - Right?
Yeah, I know.
can I check it out? - Sure.
Hey, Kyle...
Miami, Florida, a mecca for the tanned, toned and genetically blessed.
and it is here in this playground just south of heaven we have gathered 12 young women all united with one common purpose:
finding their one true soul mate.
ten weeks, ten rejections, and we're down to the final two ladies vying for Neil Palmer's heart:
grace Carlson, a 23-year-old preschool teacher from Coral Gables, Florida.
beautiful, a life force, a virgin.
I came into this a little hesitant, to be quite honest, and with no expectations.
to go from that to this makes me still believe that fairy tales don't just haen in books.
Kaitlin Sawyer, a 25-year-old paralegal from Boulder, Colorado, beautiful, but tentative.
her heart like a locket; not easily opened.
but she's still looking...
for the one man with a key.
I don't know.
I mean, all-all this stuff: the cameras and lights...
it's just all so unnatural.
I mean, who wants to fall in love with millions of people watching?
but when I look into Neil's eyes...
it's like the whole world just kinda falls away.
this is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
I care for both of these ladies deeply.
and I'm in debt to the show.
you guys have done what I haven't been able to do my entire life.
I've found my other half.
and so it comes down to this, the final moment.
at stake, a marriage proposal and a million-dollar prize.
which one of these two luckiest of ladies will be...
the marrying kind?
there he his. Hey, Neil.
are you ready? - Yeah.
Kaitlin... - Yes.
you've shown me sides of myself I never even knew existed.
and for that, I'll always be thankful.
and I hope that you'll be there for me until the day I die...
as a very good friend.
Kaitlin Sawyer, I'm afraid you're not the marrying kind.
please pack your bags.
well, Neil, here it begins... with Grace Carlson.
the first day of the rest of your life.
Oh, my God! What, what...
get, get some help!
afternoon, sir. - Ma'am.
so Dispatch said that, uh, this was a high - profile case, but they weren't kidding around.
the media's already here.
looks can be deceiving, ma'am.
Yeah. Wait a minute. No wonder this house looks familiar to me.
that's the victim? That's Grace Carlson!
this is that reality show, The Marrying Kind.
Ah, a fan.
I can tell by your suit that you're the man in charge.
I'm Myles Martini. This is my show.
and this is my crime scene now.
we were just filming the season finale.
my guy was just about to propose to Grace.
Yeah, and make her a million dollars richer.
I can't believe this. How could this have happened to her?
it happened because reality just became real.
Hey, this is how they did it.
I was wondering where they'd fit a camera crew during the confessions.
you watch this show?
Oh, yeah. ah, I watch the show.
I guess I'm more of an ESPN watcher.
well, anyway, I'm hoping that this camera caught more than a confession.
so Ryan's working on trying to get a warrant for the footage.
the thing is, the girl Grace, the victim, she was like the sweetest thing on the planet.
and granted, she's stuck in a house with 11 other catty women who are hell-bent on scoring themselves a fianc\, but murder, really?
did you find a weapon?
no, but from what I saw of Grace's body, her wounds were abraded.
so a blunt instrument was used, something other than a knife.
Yeah, the blunter the weapon, the more painful the injuries.
look at that.
it's supposed to be good luck.
talk about seeing the light, huh?
being diffracted off of the crystal.
one of them's missing a top.
that could be used as a weapon.
Yep, killer probably just used something nearby.
it's a crime of opportunity.
the chauffeur's looking really good for this right now.
when someone gets murdered in the back of your limo, you don't see anything?
you gotta be blind.
or guilty.
how many ways can I say it, lady?
I don't know how it happened.
Really?
okay, so you put Miss Carlson in the back of your limousine and she was alive, and then you dropped her off and she was dead.
that's some magic trick.
look, there's a partition between the front and the back.
I couldn't see anything.
Cody, it is in your best interest to give me something.
otherwise, you're gonna have to hire yourself a very expensive lawyer.
all right, listen, I did leave the car for a few minutes.
you did?
me and the other driver were parked at the production offices back at the Woolrich Hotel.
the chicks taped their last confession in the limo while this dude Neil waits for us back at the mansion.
so what happened?
caught a smoke break.
we're ready to shoot the final elimination. That's action on the limo.
hurry. We're gonna lose the light over the house.
all right, so then you left the girls alone for what, a few minutes?
well, it was 1: 00 when I took off, so...
I guess it was more like a half an hour.
how in the middle of production were you able to take a smoke break?
the assistant director radios us, says "Hold off.
Neil wasn't ready.
he, like, disappeared or something.
he disappeared?
it's ridiculous. Kill Grace? How could you think that?
you disappeared and you have no alibi.
I feel bad about it.
especially in light of... - In light of what?
look, I got cold feet, okay?
you can't begin to understand what I've been up against.
try me.
look, for almost three months I've had cameras on me 247.
hair and makeup people in my face, being overanalyzed by a dozen women who may or may not like me for the right reasons.
I just... needed some space.
Neil, we're ready for you on set.
could you please report to the front of the mansion?
Neil? Neil, you there?
see, here's the problem.
I find your timing suspect.
all right, maybe it was, but I just needed the time.
it made me realize something.
what's that?
when they cast me on this show, I thought it was BS.
paying me to date a dozen women?
I fell in love with Grace for free.
thank you.
Hey, Kyle.
is everything all right?
well, I was up in the catwalk earlier and I...
I saw you take that pill.
Oh, yeah. My shoulder's been hurting ever since that gazebo crashed down on me at the crime scene.
aspirin has been a good friend.
it didn't really look like aspirin.
excuse me?
I'm just saying... - I don't need to explain myself to you, Kyle.
can we get to work? - Yeah. What do you need help with?
I need you to run the sex kit and nail scrapings for Grace Carlson upstairs.
all right.
so, Grace Carlson is in the limo. 12: 30 p. m.
no driver visible.
that corroborates the driver's story.
all of my life, I have dreamed of this day. The day a...
a man like Neil would sweep me off my feet and ask me to marry him.
this is so sad. She has no idea what's coming.
we do. So get ready. We're going to jump to the end.
to go from that to this makes me still believe that fairy tales don't just happen in books. You know?
Oh, are we leaving?
wait. Bring it back up again. What happened?
that's it. The transmission cut out.
so, we lose any sign of our killer?
okay, okay. So, she gets in the car at 12: 30.
signal goes out at 12: 40.
driver leaves at 1: 00.
gives the killer 20 minutes to go in, do the deed, disappear.
okay. What about Kaitlin Sawyer's limo?
do you think that that camera caught anything?
let's take a look at her video.
I mean, who wants to fall in love with millions of people watching?
but when I look into Neil's eyes...
it's like the whole world just kind of... falls away.
wait. What is she doing?
her video cuts out.
Yeah, but by her own doing.
she just turned off the camera. I heard it.
so, both cameras go out right before the murder.
that can't be a coincidence. - No.
she had the 20 minutes to kill Grace.
so, do you think Kaitlin got wind that she was going to be runner up?
she murdered for a guy and some cash?
a million and one reasons right there.
Yep...
get you a drink? - Uh, no, thank you.
are you sure? They're on the house.
no, thank you, ma'am.
sorry about that. Marisa Dixon.
from the show. What are you doing here?
this is where Neil Palmer's reject pile goes after getting the old heave-ho.
so, you're sequestered here.
Yeah, well, they don't want us out there ruining the surprise as to who's going to win.
like we'll cry buckets or go postal or something. Whatevs.
Minibar's free and towel boys are way hot.
can you tell us where Kaitlin Sawyer is?
Runner-up? - Yep.
poor little thing's over there, mourning her million-dollar loss.
she won't talk to anybody.
if you'll excuse me, ladies. Thank you.
miss Sawyer? - Yes?
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Grace Carlson.
of course.
but you know, I really didn't see anything.
didn't the camera in the limo help?
see, the thing of it is, is both cameras lost transmission right before the murder and after the time that you left the frame.
so you think I had something to do with it?
look, the reason that I hid from the camera was because I didn't want anyone to see.
noto see what, ma'am?
that I was crying.
but when I look into Neil's eyes...
falls away.
I just...I got so wrapped up in whether or not Neil was going to pick me, and I'm not like that.
why did you appear on the show?
in my life... I've...
had some setbacks.
would you like to talk about those?
you know, on the show, I'm...
I'm known as the shy girl with the hidden past just because I don't broadcast my every afterthought.
forgive me, Miss Sawyer, but you don't seem like the other contestants.
that's sweet.
but maybe that's why I lost.
Hey, that's just another setback, right?
that's life.
so, unless there's anything else, I probably should get back to...
I'm going to ask you not to leave town, if that's okay.
I can't even leave this hotel.
if I do, I'm in breach of contract.
hang in there, okay?
Thanks.
the whole lab's buzzing about Grace Carlson's murder.
I feel like I'm in a foreign country and I don't speak the language.
it's a girl thing. - Wait a minute. You watch, too?
maybe. Well, I used to.
all these years, you still manage to surprise me.
I'd like to think that's possible.
wait a minute. You said that you used to watch it. Why did you stop?
well, I got this new diversion. Um, he's really cute.
he's about this tall. He's wearing a white shirt.
as much as I'd like you to continue, take a look-- we've got two sets of tire treads.
same as the limos from the show.
acceleration marks prove that the limos took off in a hurry on the way back to the mansion.
wheel base is 16 feet center to center.
that's the same as the cars from the show.
what do you think this is?
in the death business, we call that a great start.
my show's lead-in is a crime drama.
is this the part where you tell me this is my print?
tell me something, Mr. Martin.
martini.
Mr. Martin, why would your fingerprint be on a wireless signal-jamming device that we recovered at the scene of Grace Carlson's murder?
maybe because I use one on the show.
someone must have stolen mine.
now, what could possibly be in your job description that would call for one of those?
we use wireless cameras.
it allows me to exercise some discretion.
makes me still believe that fairytales don't just happen...
believe it or not, there's some moments we don't need recorded.
would one of those moments be when you forcibly take someone's virginity and then kill them for threatening to talk about it?
I never slept with Miss Carlson, all right?
I guess she figured she didn't need the leg up-- or two-- like the others.
but the last thing I need is for my greatest hits to end up on the net as some sort of viral video.
all right, then. So, tell me.
what is time alone with you in the limo? Is it an audition?
when the show premieres, we've got 12 nervous young women, all longing to fall for a man they don't know.
but from day one, they know me.
I'm the familiar face.
so it's natural they turn to me for comfort, reassurance.
to improve their chances of winning?
Hey, I'm just the host.
it's not my fault if they think it has some bearing.
so, I have a healthy sex drive.
you going to throw me in jail for that?
you know what?
if I could, I would.
because there are also a lot of gentlemen in there who need comfort and reassurance.
so, I heard Tara sent up samples from the victim.
Oh, yeah, from, uh, Grace Carlson.
I'm still working on the nail scrapings, but the sex kit DNA is running through the system as we speak.
you know what's funny? You're like, the first person I met who hasn't heard of her.
Yeah, sorry. I'm not really into TV.
can't beat the smell of old books.
Yeah, well, Calleigh likes the show's host for it.
apparently, you have to be on antibiotics just to be in the same room with the guy.
that the guy?
no, it's not. Thanks, Valera.
Oh, uh, by the way, old books are printed with lead-based inks, which makes them toxic.
they say television's hazardous to your health.
why am I here?
did you find who killed Grace?
we may be looking at him. - You can't be serious.
you still think I did it?
evidence tells us you took a little romp in the hay with Ms. Carlson right before she wasurdered.
we found skin cells under her nails.
it could have happened while she was fighting you off.
we never fought once. We did have sex, but...
do I have to sit here and try and convince you...
keep your voice down.
I'm sorry.
would you just take a look at the people that she did fight with?
all right, sport, you want to slip a name in the old suggestion box, fire away.
grace mentioned that someone went through her stuff back at the mansion-- destroyed it.
who would that be?
she didn't say.
said she didn't want to drag me into it.
but ask me...
the show likes to create drama.
they stuff the girls in rooms like veal, crank up the thermostat and watch the fur fly.
you want names?
I can start with two.
I'm Marisa. - Erica. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, we were Grace's roommates.
why'd you bring us here?
we're here, Ms. Dixon, because we'd like to ask you and Ms. Zabel some questions about Grace's murder.
we were told that one of you was in a fight with her.
whoever it was knew their way around a knife.
anyone could have done that.
sure that neither one of you was jealous that Neil was falling in love with Grace?
in love with Grace?
he fell in love with a new girl every five minutes. Right, Erica?
only took him three minutes to love me.
trust me, he wasn't worth killing over.
I mean, he might be good at the old puppy dog routine, but he's a total liar.
obviously, he's not the only one.
whoever shredded these clothes was very careless.
why don't you show us your hands?
fine, I did it. I shredded her stuff.
she won $3, 000 worth of clothes in a challenge. I was mad at her.
all right, and you were absolutely certain that you never got into a physical altercation with Grace?
never. - That's fine. We can verify that.
we'll get a rrant for all the footage from the house.
be my guest.
well, this is it. This all the raw footage of Grace's bedroom cam on The Marrying Kind.
what exactly are we looking for?
okay, well, if we could prove that Marisa and Grace got in a fight using DNA, we would, but Valera and I tried multiple times to get any sort of profile from the epis underneath her fingernails and there was just...
no luck? - No, not even with PCR.
the sample was just too degraded.
so we're going to need other proof. Oh, there's night footage.
hopefully, there's a cat fight between the girls and they're wearing bikinis.
did you... Wait, did you see that? Wait, rewind a bit.
what? - Zoom into that far window.
that guy-- he's just... He's just watching her.
do you recognize him?
no, not at all. I don't, I don't recognize him from the show.
well, the facial recognition software will run it against the mug shot database.
if he's in the system, we'll get a hit.
nice.
look whose number's up. - Russell Keener.
it's creepy.
Russell got popped for a DUI in Miami last month.
he was probably celebrating his release from the Kentucky state pen where he did time for assault with a deadly weapon.
that is not the kind of guy you want stalking you.
I like to work out.
take night jogs by the beach.
I didn't ask for your exercise routine, so you should probably cut to the part where you're perving out under Grace Carlson's window.
what?
I saw the lights at that house-- equipment and stuff.
figured maybe there was a party I could crash.
so you slipped past security.
the more security, the better the party.
just took a little gander.
but the place was practically empty.
a couple guys with cameras eating bagels.
not exactly Studio 54.
and you're not exactly Mick Jagger, are you?
if you did see me on some footage, you would have also seen that
I left that place without bothering anyone.
you know, that statement doesn't really convince me you're innocent, Mr. Keener.
it's not my job to convince you.
it's your job to prove it. Correct?
which you can't.
can I get out of here? - We're just going to make one quick stop.
book him. - You're arresting me? On what charge?
it's a little thing we like to call trespassing.
I can't believe you totally put me on blast in front of Neil.
please, Marisa, how many liquid lunches have you already had today?
that sounds awful. What is that?
well, you see, I realized it was going to take a few days to go through all the raw footage from The Marrying Kind, so I just downloaded all the most popular clips.
Oh, did Grace have a fight?
Oh, yeah, she got into a huge blowout with Marisa last week.
I can't believe I missed it. Here, check it out.
you could put a cork in the whole virgin ac 'cause nobody believes you.
forgive me if I don't value the opinion of a scene queen that avails herself to anyone with a pulse.
women included.
that is exactly why the remote control was invented.
and the pause button.
check that out.
that is not very ladylike.
so we took a look at all the footage, and we saw your fight with Grace.
right. And you think that's motive?
guess I did one hell of a job.
are you confessing?
to the fact that I'm a kick-ass actress? Totally.
look, most every fight on those shows is staged.
you're such a bitch, Marisa. You know he loves me.
he loves your rack, you syphilitic slut.
stop, stop, stop.
first of all, I've told you, bitch is not a word that Grace would use.
now, Marisa, I appreciate the energy and commitment,
I really do, but stick to the script, all right?
he loves your rack, not you.
then pull her hair again, okay?
let's try to get it right this time.
all right, if that's true, why didn't you tell us?
we're not supposed to advertise the fact that we're actresses.
wait a minute, you're saying that all the girls on the show are actresses?
not all. Grace was a non-pro.
we got along fine.
they just wanted to send me off with a bang, and I wanted something juicy for my reel.
what does that mean?
look, some of the girls actually think they're there to find love.
but this was like a two-and-a- half month audition for me.
and for what it's worth, I did meet the man of my dreams.
his name's Wayne Morris.
okay.
who did think that Neil was the man of their dreams?
who was in love with him enough to kill?
just one person.
let's just say she was always the bridesmaid.
even today.
ms. Sawyer?
she's gone.
no signs of Kaitlin on the hotel grounds either.
these girls are obligated by contract to stay here or face a lawsuit.
Natalia was right-- it is good luck.
found the murder weapon.
Hey, Travers.
Oh, sorry. Got a little engrossed in the light show.
um, right. We're thinking Kaitlin Sawyer the killer?
Yeah, it appears that she's fled.
we found the murder weapon in her room, so she had the means, and she was the runner-up so she's got motive.
the only thing that we don't have is the DNA linking her to the murder weapon.
and you're not listening to a single word that I'm saying.
um, my apologies.
I'm sort of stuck in a quandary. I found some trace on the weapon.
it's chemical makeup suggesting a type of salve.
but it's a synthetic tripeptide.
synthesized from what?
it has the appearance of a neurotoxin which you'd find in snake venom.
snake venom?
in snake venom?
Travers, you just... Travers, you just broke the case.
I did what now?
Calleigh, are you anywhere near the Woolrich Hotel?
I know who killed Grace.
no, I told you idiots like five damn times.
I cancelled that order, okay? I don't have the money.
ms. Dixon. - What?
come with me.
so, you rigged the show.
I made Neil an offer he couldn't refuse.
what kind of offer?
because Neil was going to be able to split the million dollars with whatever girl he chose.
well, normally, it's 5050.
but I sweetened the pot.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
it's nice to meet you.
I'm Marisa.
nice to meet you.
what are you doing? We're-We're supposed to keep those mics on.
I got a deal for you.
pick one of them, you got to split a million bucks.
me? All I want's a quarter mil.
what? - You heard me.
750k for you. We get divorced. No strings.
what do you say?
will you marry me?
there you go. We threw a dumb reality show. Sue us.
that's someone else's job.
ours is to arrest you for murder.
what are you talking about?
the weapon that was used to kill Grace had snake venom cream on it.
you ever heard of viper balm? - No.
Yes. I watched the show when you went and you had that treatment.
doesn't mean I still uset now.
all right. In that case, we will just swab your hands and your face, just to make sure.
if you had it all wrapped up with Neil, why would you have to kill Grace?
it's all Neil's fault.
he went and did it. - Did what?
he went and fell in love. Yeah.
he double-crossed me and booted me off the show.
so, it's with a heavy heart that I have to say good-bye to you today.
I hope you can understand...
and forgive me.
Marisa Dixon, I'm afraid you're not the marrying kind.
please pack your bags.
I saw Neil look at Grace, and I just knew.
he took something from me.
I wanted to take something from him.
but there was always somebody watching.
so, I snagged Myles' video jammer and I waited.
to go from that to this makes me still believe...
Oh, are we leaving?
Marisa, what are you doing here? - Shut up.
I thought I could pin it all on Kaitlin. I mean, look at her.
she totally fits the part of a murderer.
actually, you do.
Congratulations. You justlanded the role of a lifetime.
Horatio, this Kaitlin Sawyer thing has been bugging me.
if she didn't kill anybody, why would she break her contract and leave the hotel?
my question exactly.
I talked to Louisville PD.
her real name's Margery Kemp.
she changed it 14 years ago.
now, why would she do that?
she was attacked by a man with a knife when she was nine years old
almost killed her.
Horatio, it's Russell Keener.
she identified him as the attacker.
he went to prison for 15 years.
she changed her name and never looked back.
Frank, he's in the lockup.
negative. He's out on bail.
thank you, Frank.
put out a BOLO on him, please. - All right.
Kaitlin Sawyer is missing.
she is? Well, that's terrible.
now, I know you keep the girls sequestered here, so they don't talk.
sure, if even one gossip site puts up a spoiler alert, the ratings take a hit.
what do you do if they decide they want to leave? How do you find them?
when the girls are eliminated, they all get a consolation prize.
it's a cell phone from one of our sponsors.
producers use it to listen to their phone calls, but also to track their whereabouts and make sure that they don't try to fly home.
so they've got a real-time GPS locator in their phones.
which one's Kaitlin? - She's in blue.
she's in the Harbor Vista Marina. Thanks, Myles.
we just lost the signal in the ocean.
time's up, then.
get your hands in the air, Russell. Do it now.
where is Kaitlin?
little girl's taking a nap.
turn around.
I'm going to ask you a final time, Russell. Where is she?
this time, she's not waking up.
if you hurt this girl, this will be your last day on earth. Watch him.
even if you save her, you know I can find her again.
how did you know she was in Miami?
I caught that silly TV show, flipping channels.
I recognized her.
and my signature.
that girl put me away for 15 years.
she needed to be taught discipline.
nice and easy...
that a girl. That a girl.
she can change her name a thousand times.
but that scar... that's forever.
so is a life sentence.
where is he?
he's gone. He's gone forever, okay?
okay. All right.
thank you.
there you go.
there you go.
there you go.
there you go.
Hey, Calleigh.
well, I'm surprised to see you. I thought you'd be taking a personal day.
Why's that?
well, didn't Eric get out of the hospital yesterday?
Yeah, he did.
that he and I not have any contact until the investigation into the armory shooting is closed.
well, you at least got a chance to tell him that you didn't try to shoot him on purpose, though, right?
but I did shoot at him.
he was a suspect fleeing an active crime scene.
Jesse Cardoza here to see Lieutenant Caine.
I'm sorry, he's currently out in the field.
would you like me to page him?
Yeah, that'd be great. - I'll just need to see ID.
you're with LAPD.
not for long.
you got a gun locker?
Yeah, I can take care of that for you. - Okay, thanks.
get down!
everybody down! Now! You! On the ground!
hands on your head! Face down!
Lemme see your hands! You! Get over here.
get over here. Get over here!
move... or you're dead. Walk!
move! Move or you're dead! Walk!
you two, get in there.
down! Get in there.
is everyone out?
we don't know. We're doing a headcount right now.
you got any idea who these guys are?
witnesses say it's one guy barricaded in Firearms with the hostages.
where were you when it happened?
I was in the locker room. I heard it, I couldn't see it.
lieutenant, I got someone claiming to be the hostage taker on the line.
I'll take it.
this is Lieutenant Rick Stetler. Who am I speaking with?
rule number one: I ask the questions!
listen, uh... we're going to have to work together.
no, you listen to me.
get me Horatio Caine. I will only talk to him!
lieutenant Caine is in the field right now.
it may take us some time to find him.
how about ten minutes?
and after that... a hostage dies.
get Lieutenant Caine on the phone now.
Yes, sir. - Now.
let's see if your lieutenant really cares about you.
you got an ID on the assailant?
not yet. We know he's got hostages. Don't know how many.
you have ten seconds!
he is on his way. Is there anything that I...
this is Horatio.
tions, Lieent. You have just saved a life.
now let's see if you can save all of 'em.
receptionist, two techs unaccounted for. - Sounds like Danielle. Who are the techs?
Ben Perkins, Sara Clark.
okay, put 'em up in the elevator. Let's see how he did it. - I'll check into it.
Calleigh, how are you coming with the surveillance footage?
the system's web based, so we had to disable it to blind the hostage taker from seeing what we were doing.
we should have it back up soon.
all right, so we comb the footage: lobby, reception, parking lot.
see if we can get an ID.
direct line is up.
speaker will allow everyone to listen in, but only you'll be able to talk to him using that.
I will be recording everything.
are we in the one position?
okay, cut the AC. I don't want this guy getting comfortable.
and I don't want him on edge, Rick.
tell him it's being repaired. SWAT's in position.
Rick, the firearms lab was designed to be bulletproof.
even if you could see in, you couldn't get a shot to penetrate.
this was a coordinated attack, and we're covering all scenarios here.
Calleigh, surveillance is back up.
Rick... they have to keep their distance.
look, I know the hostage taker made you point man on the phone.
but I'm SOC-- SWAT has tactical command here.
this is my lab and my responsibility.
okay, here we go, everybody. Here we go.
this is Horatio.
rule two... One ring.
one ring and you answer.
okay, I understand. One ring.
go on!
hurry up!
I didn't catch your name, friend.
it's 'cause I didn't tell you, Horatio.
look, u can ll me Ted.
okay, Ted, is everybody okay in there?
Oh, everyone is fine, so long as you keep answering the phone.
okay. It's just you and me.
we can all walk away from this together.
no, no, no one is walking. You just listen!
that's what you do here!
I can do that, too, Ted.
you probably think I'm a whack job, right?
Ted, I don't think you're a whack job.
people find themselves in bad situations all the time.
that sums it up.
the American Dream trampled on by anyone and everyone.
get that in front of the door!
but you...
you're gonna get us out of this one.
you're gonna make sure justice is done.
that's why I asked for you.
how can I help you get justice?
right, I tell you, and you ignore me like everybody else. No!
this is my thing, my way and my timetable.
Ted, I understand that, but I can't hold SWAT back forever.
well, I got something for them.
rule number three is...
I see a cop, I kill a cop.
so, we found coveralls and a tool belt stashed on the top of the elevator.
I'm guessing that's where he also put his motorcycle helmet and his weapons.
okay.
this is what he looks like in the lobby.
unfortunately, we still don't have a good look at his face, and the Firearms camera was knocked out before we could get a look at him.
I got a Ted Wells who checked in at 8: 23 a. m.
no, that's not going to do us any good. That's the same alias that he gave Horatio.
you know what? I'm going to backtrack and see if we can figure out how he got here.
he drove himself. All right. That means the van's probably still in the parking lot.
that's great. I'll grab somebody and head over there.
by the way, Ted Wells has been checking in all week.
that's probably how he snuck all the weapons into the lab.
Hey, Ryan. - Yeah.
take a look at this.
it's that guy Jesse Cardoza.
the new transfer from LA.
he used to work here with Horatio back in the day.
he wasn't supposed to be here for another week.
you think he's armed?
no. Look.
here he is at reception, checking in his backup.
the HT would've known he'd taken a police officer hostage.
I'm afraid that if they figure out this guy's a cop...
they're going to kill him.
you. Up.
get those boxes in front of the windows. Now! Let's go!
settle down.
what's that?
Hello?
Hello?
you, sit down!
everybody, empty your pockets.
no phones, wallets, Berries, whatever.
nobody talks to the outside!
pass me the box.
S-Slide it over here.
Jesse Cardoza. California.
you're a long way from home, aren't you, Hollywood?
you know, I've never been to Cali.
Oh, you're an actor, right?
everybody there's an actor, right?
I mean, even the governor.
I'm not an actor.
so why are you here?
you forced us in here, as I recall.
no, why are you here? In Miami?
I'm just on vacation.
why are you here at this crime lab?
someone stole my car. I was just filing a report is all...
with her? - Yeah.
I find out you're lying, I'll kill her.
Yeah, and you'll leave here in a box-- I guarantee it.
Oh, man.
I really hope you're an actor.
cause you scared me.
sir, I know the hostage taker's van looks dirty, but it's clean as a whistle.
no VIN, clean plates, no fingerprints.
these your blueprints?
Yeah, blueprints of the lab.
this guy really did his homework.
probably knows the building better than we do.
check this out.
label torn off, no name. Little blue pills.
not exactly. Diazepam.
they're antidepressants.
well, this just gets better and better, doesn't it?
without those, his state of mind's gonna get a lot worse.
you, up! Plug in the fan and get some air moving in here.
come on! Faster! Faster!
shots fired, shots fired!
yeah? - Ted, was anyone hurt?
I got your attention now, huh?
Ted, I need an answer. Was anyone hurt?
just the ceiling. You do something about fixing the AC in here!
I'm working on it, but I need you to remain calm.
Ted, do you want me to get your meds?
so you found my van. You know what? Don't worry about me!
Ted, is there anyone I can contact, a wife or a girlfriend?
is that the justice you're looking for?
you don't even know who I am.
I know you're not Ted Wells.
she used to look up to me. You know?
I made one mistake.
one bad business deal.
I dug myself my own...
look in public records. Check any recent divorce action.
rname unknn. Do it right now. - Got it.
Ted, do you want me to find Tanya?
you two can talk it through.
no, I think she's done talking to me.
what if I were to set it up?
what the hell is that? - It's just... just the AC, man.
Horatio! You got SWAT coming in here?
it's probably the AC, Ted.
I see a cop, I shoot!
don't you try me, Horatio!
Hey, calm down, all right? Look, it's the air duct. - Stay out of this, Hollywood.
just stay out of this! And you sit down!
you, sit down! Sit down!
Ted, I need you to calm down. Put the gun down.
shut up! You, over there now! - Put the gun down! Look at her, she's scared!
if you put the gun... - Sit down!
disconnected.
SWAT is holding their position. It's not my fault.
it's about the life of a hostage, Rick. It's not about you.
I need your vest, please. - You're not going in there.
have the bus ready.
let's move out.
stay on him close. This is a suicide mission.
how bad is it?
looks like it may have missed the femoral artery, but I gotta get this bleeding under control.
Hey, you! Come here, come on.
look, keep constant pressure on this wound, okay?
sorry. How you feeling?
it's cold. It's so cold.
what's going on?
her pulse is thready and tachy.
she's lost distal pulse; she's going into shock.
take your lab coat off. Come here, let's cover her up.
here, we gotta get her warm.
here we go. Here. Thanks.
okay... - Sure you want to come work here?
you're a cop.
Horatio? - I'm coming in.
O-okay, okay!
I'm unarmed.
it's Horatio Caine.
you know, you look just like you do on TV.
you know, like-like when you found that Walsh baby last year.
nobody thought you'd find that kid alive.
I need the woman.
look... I want a helicopter.
and I want $100, 000.
this is not a negotiation.
all right, here we go.
you're going with them, Danielle.
you're gonna be fine, sweetheart. You're gonna make it!
one of y'all better negotiate with me!
okay, I'm listening.
look, I want a copter and 100 K.
all right, we'll work on that.
Yeah, work fast, otherwise your cop Cardoza here is next.
and no Fed money.
no banks, no dye packs.
go to one of those check cashing places.
Yep, I know a place.
Yeah, I know a place, too. There's one on Eighth and Gillpark. yal sta.
go there and believe me, I'll know if you don't.
my clerk tells me you want to cash a check for $100, 000?
actually, we want to give you an IOU. - Funny.
get out of here, or I'm going to call the cops.
look, we are the cops, okay? We've got a hostage situation.
people's lives are at stake. Here's our paperwork.
O-okay, y-you know what?
you can't just come in here and clean me out, okay?
I mean, how am I gonna get my money back?
I understand what you're saying, and I'm sorry.
but if you have any other questions, you're gonna have to get in contact with Horatio Caine.
if I have any... Fine, I'll just open the safe.
I'll open the safe. - Thank you.
you! You bring it in here.
I want the building clear and everyone out.
and then clear a path via the south stairwell.
you know, that isn't very smart.
you're gonna be exposing yourself to SWAT out there.
Yeah, well, I got a plan for that.
you just get on the phone and tell them I expect to see Horatio out there.
Yeah, this is Cardoza.
I just wanted to let you know he's gonna be on the move.
ten minutes!
stand by, everybody. My orders only.
hang on.
the HT has a weapon secured to one of the hostages.
where is the third hostage? He had three.
who's got eyes on Jesse? Where's Jesse?
our window is closing, Lieutenant. We have a shot. Please advise.
stand by. I repeat, stand by.
SWAT team, stand down. That is not the HT. It is Jesse.
stand down! He's one of ours. Go!
Freeze! On the ground! - Get the helmet off him. Get the helmet off him!
get this gun off, all right? I'm taped to the trigger.
ere is he? - I don't ow. He nt us over here as a distraction.
he also left the money. Where's that bag?
doesn't make any sense. - It might. He's trying to tell me something.
you get that UV?
the security strip on this bill is glowing blue.
the security strip on a 50 is supposed to glow yellow.
it should. It's fake. It's all fake. It's all counterfeit.
he wanted us to find it.
and who made it. Let's go.
you own Royal Vista Check Cashing, Mr. Ripley?
uh, you know what? Here's a better question.
when are you paying back the 100 grand that you took from me?
pay you back? What the hell are you talking about?
that money's not worth the lint in my pocket.
Yes, what my esteemed colleague is trying to say is that we know you're counterfeiting money.
get out of here, man. You guys got some bad intel.
the burn marks on your hands indicate a process that uses a corrosive material to strip ink off bills.
then you print whatever denomination you want.
okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look, just listen.
you guys came into my workplace, no warrant, nothing-- which I was cool with, by the way
and now you're setting me up.
no we didn't, but somebody wanted to make sure you wentown for this.
why don't you have a seat?
what's Mr. Sloan's full name?
I'll check it out.
track down the ex-wife.
Yeah, track her down. What, are you guys kidding me?
what does he have anything to do with this?
Mr. Sloan is seeking justice.
you did something to him, and now he's sent me after you. Why?
we were legitimate business partners, okay?
I was starting this new venture, this drive-in, check-cashing thing.
I mean, we both went in 50-50.
which means, he put up his life savings, and you put up fake paper.
Yeah, that. Whatever.
see, when the venture failed, he noticed that I wasn't too concerned about it, so he somehow figured out that I was counterfeiting. You know?
then he kept calling the Better Business Bureau.
he kept calling the attorney general's office.
he was trying to sic them on me. I mean, he was crazy, man.
this man... has you facing federal charges now, so who's crazy?
I just have a few questions that I need to ask you, Ms. Sloan.
arrington now.
Mrs. Arrington.
has your ex-husband approached you or attempted to contact you in any way?
no. Here's a picture of Mathew.
thank you.
have you got any idea where he might go? Friends? Other family?
we haven't seen him since the restraining order was issued last month.
you have a restraining order against Mathew?
when I filed for divorce, he didn't take it well.
Yeah. He acted like it was her fault he lost everything they had to that fraud, Ripley.
are you saying you believe that your divorce had something to do with business dealings with Darren Ripley?
I knew that guy was no good, but Mathew wouldn't listen.
he lost all of our savings.
after I left him, he would call at all hours, just show up at my work, wanting to explain himself.
tell me about the restraining order.
he showed up a month ago, freaking out, picked a fight with my front door, and then ran off like a coward.
that was the last straw. I didn't feel safe.
we got a TRO, which only made him angrier.
could have been what incited today's incident.
who knows why Mathew does anything.
he had to agree to get on meds just to get visitation rights.
what about your son? Does he have a cell phone? Would Mathewry and contact him?
that's exactly why I won't let him have one.
well, I'd like to talk to him anyway, if you don't mind.
I don't think that's necessary.
Jason's been through so much already.
I can't do that to him. I'm sorry.
I understand.
well, this picture will be very helpful, and thank you for your time.
Hey, it's Calleigh.
listen, I need you to access some divorce records for me.
so, Sergeant Tripp called.
they found nothing at Mathew Sloan's last known address.
okay, thank you. You picked up right where you left off, huh?
you don't mind if I start early, see this through?
you never have to ask, Jesse. Excuse me.
did you get 'em?
where are you, Mathew?
Darren Ripley's gonna get what's been coming to him, right?
Yes. Now he's facing felony counterfeit charges, Mathew.
you should have come to me first.
not everybody can live in Miami, man.
out here in the sticks, we got a bunch of Keystone Cops that never make the 6: 00 news, but you-- you all over TV. Helping people.
so your answer is to commit a crime in my backyard.
well, it worked, didn't it? I got justice.
Yes, but now you're a felon.
and as a felon, Mathew, you need to turn yourself in.
no, not yet.
you got the person that ruined my life, but not the one that took all I had left.
who would that be?
that's what I need you to find out.
what happens, Mathew, if I find you first?
this is interesting.
the wife filed a petition for sole custody of her son three weeks ago.
the Arringtons didn't say anything to me about it.
sole custody on what grounds?
it says,"Pursuant to the minor's affidavits in family court.
you know, the boy, Jason-- he had a cast.
well, papers concerning a minor are usually sealed.
well, let's figure out a way to open them.
I'll see what I can dig up.
she's scared. What are you doing? Just put the gun down...
you, listen to me!
I see a cop, I shoot!
you're gonna make sure justice is done.
H, there you are. Call just came in.
mathew Sloan was spotted at Lloyd Arrington's house.
okay. I'll be there.
so, what do we have? - Nada. Family wasn't here at the time.
patrol has fanned out, canine unit's been notified.
was anything taken from the inside? - No.
pool guy across the street said he just showed up, kicked the door in and hightailed it out of here.
well, that's a new one. You kick the door in, and then turn around and flee?
you know, friends, I think this is another message.
I think you're right. I'm gonna go get my kit.
any updates?
Yeah, I'm running it through CODIS right now.
travers ran the white substance that coated the hair. - And?
it was sodium, and the mineral content suggests it was sea salt.
well, that's certainly helpful, seeing as Miami is surrounded by water.
right.
Lloyd Arrington? Uh, okay.
well, that's got to be a mistake, so, let me just run it again.
wait a minute. What if Mathew didn't kick in the door?
eyewitnesses saw him there at the scene.
no. I'm talking about the initial incident.
the one the couple got the restraining order on.
what if Lloyd Arrington kicked in his own door a month ago, and left a hair behind?
and it's been accumulating salt from the marine air since.
exactly.
that's what Mathew wanted us to find. He was framed.
Yeah, your ex has completely lost it.
he just came here and came after me.
he kicked the door in. We have to do something about this.
okay. Okay, I'll call a lawyer.
so youke down door and then provided false testimony to secure the restraining order against Mathew.
that guy couldn't move on with his life.
what was I supposed to do, wait till he killed one of us?
need I remind you that perjury is a felony and you're facing five years.
Yeah, I want a lawyer.
and you're going to need one.
you used the system to kick a man who was already down.
What'd you get?
I dug up underlying court documents related to the Sloan divorce.
affidavit of the minor Jason Sloan.
the little boy.
there was a history of abuse. Beatings.
at first the boy admitted that his dad's the one who knocked him around, then he recanted.
and Child Services said the only reason he recanted was because he feared his father, and the judge agreed. Mathew Sloan lost custody three weeks ago.
this is the justice that Mathew was looking for.
you know, that guy lied about getting the TRO.
maybe he's the abuser.
there's only one way to find out. - Follow the evidence.
no wonder Jason recanted his story.
he must've been terrified of his father.
you're so sure it was Mathew Sloan?
Yeah. I mean, he did shoot somebody this morning.
I was there, Calleigh.
look, you've seen this guy's file.
before today, I mean, this guy's done everything, everything he can to get his life back together.
I mean, first this Darren Ripley guy takes his money, but he couldn't find any recourse for that.
then he gets a TRO thrown at him for making harassing phone calls in the middle of the night.
the guy works two jobs. That's when he's off.
Hey, you've worked doubles before.
how many times have you gotten off work, you called somebody not realizing what time it was?
once or twice.
and the medication that you found in the van, he was taking that so he could see his kid.
that guy did not beat his son.
okay. Let's suppose it's Lloyd the stepdad.
do we have any evidence to support that?
well, you mentioned he had a broken arm. - Yeah.
hospital said the boy suffered a distal radius fracture two weeks ago.
well, Mathew lost custody.
hasn't been allowed to see his kid in three weeks. So, he's not responsible for that.
that's true.
you know, what if this didn't happen the first time?
what if the broken wrist is a result of repeated abuse?
do it hard enough often enough, you get a radius fracture.
you are coming with me! - Please, it hurts. Please.
let's go. Now!
what? Well, what are you thinking?
look at the size of the bruises.
all right, what about it?
well, these pictures are to scale.
you're roughly the same size as Lloyd.
put your hand next to it.
my hand's bigger than the bruise.
your hand is bigger than the bruise.
whoever jerked this kid around had a smaller hand.
like a woman's.
someone's got to talk to that poor kid.
I like the color.
how's the arm?
it itches. Is my dad in trouble?
well, Jason... I'm going to get him some help. Okay?
how'd it happen?
I don't know. It just hurt.
the doctor said it was a hair fracture.
you know, I know you're scared.
and I know you don't want to talk about it.
I understand the situation... very well.
you want to make your dad happy, so you tell the truth.
you want to make your mom happy, so you tell a lie.
the judge makes a decision, right?
and he makes the wrong one.
Jason... I know that your mom is hurting you.
and I want you to know that it's not your fault.
I don't want to lie anymore.
I know you don't, and I'm going to fix it so you never have to tell another lie again.
dad never hurt me.
mom said she was scared that he'd take me away. - Right.
I believe you.
and I'm going to make this all right. All right?
okay. - All right, now. Hang in there.
we know how this happened.
it's so hard. You have no idea.
see, Mrs. Arrington, I do.
and you knew if you followed this procedure and accused your husband of abuse, the court would probably side with you.
I never meant to hurt my boy. - There is no...
no excuse for what you did. Ever.
reporting to you live in front of Miami-Dade Police Department on today's hostage situation.
information is still coming in.
unfortunately, police still have no leads on the whereabouts of Mathew Sloan, the man who allegedly stormed into their crime lab this morning.
however, we do have reports that Sloan's ex and her husband have both been taken into custody.
we don't yet know how these arrests might relate to the attack, but we'll keep you updated as this story continues to develop...
911, what's your emergency?
get on the ground!
get on the ground right now!
I knew it. I knew you would do it.
well, you were looking for justice, Mathew. I guess you found it.
but now you know the truth.
I do know the truth.
can you tell my son why I did this?
that I did it for him.
you know, Mathew...
I think you can explain that a whole lot better than I can.
Hey, little man. Hey, little man.
I love you.
listen, Daddy's got to go away.
just for a little bit.
Horatio's going to take care of you.
now, you listen to Horatio. - Okay.
Mathew, it's time.
you know, you held up pretty well today.
Yeah, I wasn't the only one.
Danielle's stable. She's going to make it.
so we can all swing by the hospital on the way home from here.
that's good news.
very good news. - Yeah.
I think you forgot something.
my old shield. You find it in Firearms?
why don't you replace it with this?
welcome back, CSI Cardoza. - Thanks.
ma'am? I'd like to buy another round.
sorry, H,but the new guy buys the next round.
Hey, technically, I was here way before you, but I'll buy.
what are you having?
a club soda.
Oh, come on, H. - We're off the clock. Come on.
somebody... has to drive.
I'm not tall enough to reach the pedals...
this is WINK News Radio.
the SEC and FBI have frozen Howard Burgess' assets and are moving closer to a trial date in his embezzlement charges.
where you headed?
hangar Four.
brazilian model's flying in to surprise her athlete boyfriend.
rough life, right?
noticed that limo's parked in a restricted area.
I'll call HQ.
22 to central.
I've got some suspicious activity going on over here at Hangar Four, call for back-up.
stop the plane!
he's stealing the plane!
shut it down!
central, I need that back-up now!
turn off your engine!
stop the plane right now!
stay where you are, or I will shoot!
I can't believe you shot at me.
what the hell were you planning on doing with Howard Burgess' airplane?
Howard Burgess? I don't know him.
right.
burgess is all over the news.
maybe you wanted to steal a piece of history.
this is professional asset seizure.
keep your hands where I can see them!
slow, slow.
slow!
I've got my authorization paper and my recovery agent's license.
you're a repo guy for private jets?
exactly. This guy, Howard Burgess, is six months behind on his payments.
I'm just transporting it to its rightful owner.
I don't care what you're doing, you boarded this aircraft illegally.
turn around.
what's that smell?
did you stir the tanks in the toilet?
smells like a dead body.
better get PD out here.
Ooh, that's not pretty.
well, what do you know, Frank?
scammed half of Miami out of their life savings.
a lot of people think he ought to be right there, me included.
why you?
crooked bastard soaked my 401K for ten grand.
what I don't understand is, big-time money guys like this always get a house arrest.
full surveillance till the trial is over.
Yeah, so the question is, did somebody break him out, or set him up for murder?
=bbs. sfileydy. com=- proudly presents
Yeah, it's hot out.
glad I'm wearing this vest.
so, you get to fish Howard Burgess out of the toilet.
have fun with all that.
you know, why don't you go for it?
Oh, I'm sorry, first come, first slime, my friend.
why don't we play for it?
rock, paper, scissors, are you serious?
it's the LA way. What, are you scared?
hell no, just not eight years old, that's all, man.
on three and then you show.
okay, look at me.
all right, I got it.
Oh, snap!
that's the Miami way.
have fun with the potty party.
that's good because I wouldn't want to get that sweater vest dirty.
that's mean.
Hey, Walter, glad to see you're out of the lab.
what do we have here?
we got a dead guy that got shoved into a toilet.
new guy gets the dirty work. - Me?
it's the Miami way.
cute.
well, this isn't my first rodeo.
Oh, really, you've stolen planes before?
I don't steal; I reclaim property.
I'm a repo man.
well, if this is all so legit, then how come half a dozen airport security officers had you at gunpoint?
I have to get the plane out of the hangar before it's legally mine.
and if somebody tells me to stop before takeoff, I have to comply.
did Howard Burgess ask you to stop and so you stuffed him in a toilet?
Howard Burgess must've been dead back there before I boarded.
we'll see about that.
have a nice time at PD.
pull him.
Jesse? - Yeah?
found this up there in the mess.
looks like a hand-rolled marijuana cigarette.
Yeah, get it to the lab. See if we can get DNA.
and you need to hit the showers.
will do, Coach.
Hey, I,uh, spoke with the vic's corrections officer.
he gave me the coordinates of Howard's GPS ankle monitor.
I'm calling it up on the phone.
red dot's still blinking on the Burgess property.
well, I guess that explains why no one was alerted when Howard moved beyond the signal's boundary.
co never knew Howard left.
hold on a second.
that monitor's on the move.
I'll let the CO know we're responding.
it's okay.
you see that?
Howard's ankle monitor.
good boy.
Oh, that's not all.
what do you got?
blood.
whatever happened to Howard might've started here.
you're Howard Burgess' son, Daniel, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry for your loss.
you're gonna find whoever did this, right?
well, that's the plan.
you have anybody that can account for your whereabouts this morning?
I-I was sleeping.
just woke up when your station called.
you know, we found a hand-rolled cigarette on your dad's plane. - So?
so, if it's yours, it puts you at the murder scene.
I mean, the joint's probably mine from, like, a week ago.
I was partying on the plane with some friends. I probably dropped it.
I-I would never hurt my dad.
let me see your hand.
did you get that helping your dad remove his ankle bracelet?
you okay?
Yeah.
good job.
I'm not saying another word.
you don't have to.
drug possession.
aiding and abetting a man under house arrest.
those are serious crimes.
come with me.
I know you probably don't believe this, but my dad wasn't a bad man.
at first he exaggerated the investment reports a little.
then he could never catch up.
he wanted so bad for those big returns to be true for his clients.
when the market crashed, he...
he was in too deep.
okay.
Daniel, what happened after you removed the ankle monitor?
he left in his car.
he was going to pay back the investors some of what they lost.
but somebody killed him before he got the chance.
Daniel, he was going to pay them back with what money?
I-I don't know.
but-but my dad said the Feds would just keep whatever money they find for themselves, not pay back the investors.
you do understand, I'm not a Fed.
and I just want to find who killed him.
do you think you can clear his name?
I'm going to do my best.
well, what about me?
am I... am I going to jail?
you'll probably receive probation.
but more importantly, Daniel, you need to be honest with me.
thank you.
I... I honestly don't know where my dad was keeping his money.
she doesn't know either. She has nothing to do with this.
Where's your mother now, son?
she said she was going to the mall.
Mrs. Burgess?
look who's out spending money in Ocean Walk Park.
it's not what it looks like. I'm working.
you expect us to believe you're working here for money?
my son and I will be homeless in a few days unless I can save up a security deposit for a rental.
why don't you try to hock some of your diamonds?
Mrs. Burgess, when was the last time you saw your husband?
a few days ago, I think.
a few days ago.
since they froze our assets, our lawyers thought that it would be best if we lived in separate wings of the house.
I know what you're thinking.
that I bilked all of those investors out of their life savings.
I must have known everything that my husband was up to, but I didn't.
he was always in his office, writing in those notebooks.
I had no idea what he was up to.
you were vice president of his investment fund.
it was written all over the fake paperwork you jokers sent me.
he put my name on those papers so that it would seem like a family business.
no one believes me.
Mrs. Burgess, that's not necessarily true.
that's her!
you're a thief!
got one question: where is my money? Huh?
you wiped out my family's entire savings account.
and put us out on the street!
sir. Sir, this is a murder investigation.
I'd appreciate it if you'd step back.
you should be investigating where my money went.
everybody knows she and her husband have money hidden out there somewhere.
sir, this is not the time or the place.
this is Allison Burgess!
she has millions stashed away.
take him.
you're under arrest, pal. You're going down to PD.
you suck!
Yeah, give me back my money!
here we go. Right away. Right to the car.
Howard Burgess got what he deserved.
and you're next!
excuse us, please. Out of the way.
you're just lucky the cops are here.
next time they won't be here to save you.
bitch!
look, please. I just need some soda, juice, anything.
I just gave you water ten minutes ago.
you don't understand.
Oh, I understand fine.
you ask me again, I'm gonna cuff you to the bench.
is everything okay?
officer, I need you to get this man something to drink. Something with sugar.
you're hypoglycemic, is that right?
diabetic.
okay. Just hang on.
thank you.
you're welcome.
let me check and see how long you have to be here.
isn't that the guy Tripp brought in?
Yeah, his name's Carlos Guzman.
they're just about to release him.
what happen, he lose a lot of money?
he said Burgess took everything, and put his family out on the street.
and now, to make matters worse, he's got a public defender.
Oh, man, that guy's hit a rough patch.
Yeah.
I hope he makes it through.
so do I.
can I get you a cab or something?
pay the driver with what, my good looks?
well, I can see if someone's going your way. I could ask around.
look, man, no one's going my way.
you don't know that.
I live in my car.
my wife's coming to get me.
Howard Burgess wiped you out.
nail in the coffin.
I was a music teacher.
then the county cut all the arts programs, laid me off.
lost my health insurance.
put our little bit of savings into Howard Burgess, just to get out from under it all, you know.
and then he stole it.
all of it.
I'm sorry.
not as much as my wife...and my son.
don't give up.
everyone deserves a second chance.
are you hurt?
no, I just lost my temper with that awful woman.
I'm sorry, baby.
let's go.
Hey, Mijo.
Hi, it's Jesse Cardoza.
I have a question about the Coastline Plaza building.
Yeah, okay.
well, have her business manager call me when she gets in, all right?
Thanks.
what's up?
that your girlfriend?
not quite.
Oh, I see.
keeping your options open.
Yeah, that's how I like to roll, too.
well, I'll be in the morgue if you need me.
wish we could find those notebooks she was telling us about.
Mr. Wolfe, did you hear that?
Yeah, these are Howard Burgess's ledgers.
I bet the Feds would love to get their hands on these.
the Feds and everybody in the state of Florida.
maybe now we'll know where he stashed his millions.
and maybe, maybe who killed him.
go through those with a fine-tooth comb.
what about the so-called Burgess treasure, the money that they say he had locked away?
the ledger seems to indicate there was a, uh, secret stash.
by my estimates, somewhere in the eight figure category.
take a look at this.
every entry with a red tab that says "noise."
they all seem to be taking money out of people's accounts.
you know,"noise" could be the password for some sort of a hidden bank account.
Yeah, but there's no, uh, Cayman or Swiss bank accounts that have any record of doing business with Burgess.
okay, keep at it.
I'll be down in Autopsy.
Hey, Tom.
cause of death on this one's plain as day-- strangulation.
and our killer was kind enough to leave a very helpful clue.
it looks like some sort of a chain.
we've got a murder weapon in our sights, and we haven't even gotten to the exciting part.
there's an exciting part.
what the hell are you doing with that banana?
if I strangle the banana, then look at the outer skin,
I don't see much evidence of damage, but...
if I peel it...
it looks like pudding.
right. But...
Howard here has more than fruit inside-- he has bones.
when his neck was getting squeezed, the vertebrae actually separated.
the force it takes to dislodge those vertebrae is massive.
okay, so we had a really strong killer.
more than strong.
this is beyond human.
think machine.
something with a chain attachment.
I bet there's something like that at the hangar.
I'm gonna go back and see if I can find something that fits the description.
Thanks, Tom. - Sure.
here we go. I've got chain.
it's attached to chock blocks, which are technically heavy enough to stop a plane, so I guess they could be used to kill somebody.
Yeah, well, except there's nothing mechanical about chocks.
I'm surprised Burgess uses aluminum chocks.
extruded rubber's more appropriate for this plane.
you know a lot about planes.
I have my pilot's license.
of course you do.
what about that?
you think he got winched?
maybe.
there's blood. - Looks like we found our murder weapon.
let's take the winch back to the lab, and I guess we'll just...
get someone to barricade the runway now!
get your hands up!
get down here.
I have all the proper documentation, Officers.
turn around.
hands on your head.
get on your knees.
this is a professional asset seizure.
this is a professional asset seizure.
I've got the authorization papers and my repo license.
you know, that sounds familiar.
what do you guys have-- some sort of a script you read from?
no, just these papers in my back pocket.
it's the same paper the other guy had.
well, I don't know how.
my boss owns this plane straight out.
who's your boss?
Gary Archer of Land East Air.
this bird is worth 20 mil.
Mr. Archer, you have legal right to the jet, but you should have come to us first.
I apologize for that.
okay, did you know Howard Burgess?
no, he's a customer.
I just wanted my plane back.
okay, so when the first repo man failed you, you hired the second one?
no.
Byron Pearce is the only person I hired.
I would have flown the thing out myself if I hadn't have let my license lapse.
you know what? Until I can confirm that, I would appreciate it if you canceled all your meetings.
so if Gary Archer didn't hire that first repo man, who did?
I guess I was hoping you'd tell me.
these are his papers; we got them from the airport officers.
wait a minute.
we've got some indentations here.
you think those are handwriting?
let's find out.
that is a signature.
a few more letters and we'll know whose.
the victim's wife hired this repo man?
thank you.
you didn't like working at the mall, did you?
excuse me?
I guess you figured hocking your hubby's jet was a lot easier than hocking cookies.
what are you talking about?
so you found out.
Mrs. Burgess, you hired Tony Conner to take that jet.
Yeah, I thought I could sell it, and the money could help me and my son and pay back some of the people that my husband hurt.
here's the problem-- you didn't own the jet.
Howard never paid it off.
he told me he paid cash up front.
that was a lie.
he was hiding it from its rightful owner, and by the way, he showed up this afternoon to collect.
so... I guess I really am flat broke.
what happened to Howard's big old treasure?
I-I, uh... I wish I knew something about it.
so he didn't tell you.
no.
I bet that pissed you off.
so much so that maybe you killed him over that money?
wait a minute.
you were protecting me earlier.
Mrs. Burgess, your role in the murder has yet to be determined.
are you saying I'm under arrest?
not yet.
so the DNA on our blood and soft tissue is a match to our victim.
and I'm not seeing any signs of trace.
hopefully Ryan's having better luck with the ledger.
you know, I have to say, still, I'm excited.
this is my first case of death by winch.
you haven't changed much since the day I met you, have you?
Oh, my gosh, that was my first day, wasn't it?
Yeah, I remember the very enthusiastic lateral.
I was right to be. This is a great lab.
it's certainly not the broom closet I remember.
so what brought you back to Miami?
partially personal.
a girl?
kind of, but not the way you're thinking.
that's very mysterious.
not as mysterious as our killer.
an, I'm not seeg anything that suggests he touched the murder weapon.
the only place we know that he touched was the private jet's toilet, and someone's already made Walter go through that.
wait a minute.
I mean, there is a part of the toilet we've been overlooking.
boy, you really got me paying my dues today.
I got to thinking -
after the tank, the waste passes through pipes and a pump and ends up in a filter.
where things like evidence can get caught?
exactly.
you're doing good.
let's see what we got.
what's that?
it's a contact lens.
can't be viable for DNA.
much like our victim, it's been in sewage all morning.
no, we may not need DNA.
I mean, the lensometer should be able to measure the prescription.
all we have to do is match that to the suspect.
and there was that one guy-- Carlos something or other.
uh... you know, the guy that tried to attack Burgess' wife.
he did wear glasses.
maybe because he lost his contacts in the murder.
I don't know, man, that guy is just trying to get by.
I mean, he's living in his car.
Yeah, all because of Howard Burgess.
maybe it's just me, but it sounds like motive.
can I see your glasses, please?
what for?
I don't understand.
you don't have to understand. You attacked a woman in broad daylight.
it's not a stretch for you to kill Burgess.
I didn't kill him.
I have a family who depends on me.
I lost my temper at the mall.
I overreacted.
it was wrong.
match?
no.
what does that mean?
means your eyes are innocent.
sorry we made you come back in.
I'll walk you out.
lieutenant, traffic copter just located Burgess' car.
fifth and Clover.
I'm on my way.
I guess Howard abandoned the Bentley on the way to his plane.
maybe he ran out of gas.
that's not what happened, Frank.
this tire has been slashed.
I guess they didn't want him to drive out of here.
so the struggle could have started here, ended at the hangar.
you got treads on another car?
I've got a single tread synonymous with a motorcycle.
I let you off with a warning, Daniel, because I thought you were being honest with me.
I was.
you ran your father off the road this morning, son.
Yeah, so?
you broke him out. And then you tried to stop him.
Why?
he said he was going to pay people back.
I... I trusted him.
I... I always trusted him.
then, after we got the anklet off, I saw him grab a suitcase.
I... I checked his closet, and his passport was gone.
so, I... I chased him.
I saw his car speeding down Coral Drive, and...
and I had to stop him, so I just sped up.
pull over!
Daniel, what the hell do you think you're doing?
you said you were gonna pay the investors at least half of what you owe; now where are you going?
don't be naive. There's nothing left for me to do.
they're going to lynch me.
you lied to me?
you can never know the kind of pressure I'm under.
I hope they do lynch you.
he left me and my mom behind.
and now she's getting blamed for all this stuff she didn't even do.
how am I supposed to fix that?
don't grow up to be like him.
what about our ledger? Did any of our suspects show up on here?
Yeah.
Carlos Guzman... and Gary Archer.
no wonder Gary Archer wanted his plane back.
looks like his company lost millions to Burgess.
land East Air? - Yeah. Why?
because he never mentioned investing with Burgess.
do you wear contacts, Mr. Archer?
I'm not sure I understand where you're going with this.
can you pop one out for me?
right here? It's not very sanitary.
negative seven-point-five.
what are you talking about?
the contacts that you wear matches the exact prescription of a lens we found at the murder scene of Howard Burgess.
I think it fell out when you were hiding his body.
why would I kill him?
because Burgess stole tens of millions of dollars from your company.
it was not just my money.
I convinced my entire family to invest with him.
my sister.
my two brothers.
my parents.
my grandparents.
when I lost everything, they lost everything.
that must have crushed you.
with everything that he took from me, at the very least, Howard Burgess owed me my plane.
I subscribed to all flight tracking online sites, watching for Burgess to move.
this morning, I see the tail number popping up to go to the Caymans, so I know he's getting away.
Hey, stop right now, or I'll stop you myself.
Gary, we can make a deal here.
I'm done doing business with you. This plane is mine.
looks like I'm pretty good at taking what's yours.
I was just there to keep him from taking my plane.
but he starts fighting me like a caged animal.
I lost it.
and then you hid his body.
I thought it would go undetected in the plane and I would send my repo guy to fetch it for me.
Howard Burgess got what was coming to him.
a lot of people are going to be happy with what I did.
they're going to want to shake my hand.
those people are going to have to settle for a phone call through glass.
I can't believe, after all this, we still have no idea where Burgess's money is.
and the only credible lead we have is the word "noise."
maybe the Feds will eventually figure out what that means.
maybe there's no money.
between the house, the Bentley, the plane...
let me see that for a minute.
take a look at the tail number.
Oh, that's just like a license plate for a plane.
does it look special to you?
what if it was a word?
what if the 1 was an "i" and the 5 was an "S"?
the money's on the plane.
if I were you, I'd put that down.
what are you doing here, Daniel?
I'm taking what my father owes me.
that money never belonged to your father.
it certainly doesn't belong to you, son.
but he promised me. He said this was mine.
it was supposed to go back to the investors. Remember?
well... well, I guess... I guess I lied about that.
Daniel, what the hell do you think you're doing?
you said you'd split the cash with me if I broke you out.
tell me how your passport fits into that plan.
don't be naive. I worked too hard for that money to let go of it now.
so, you lied to me?
let me give you some fatherly advice.
in this world, it's every man for himself.
well, in that case...
I... I thought that would stop him.
and then, when you guys said that his body was on the plane, I knew that's where the money had to be.
I guess it's like what my dad said.
it... it's every man for himself.
what about your mother?
people are just going to think whatever they want to about her anyway.
in my experience, the truth comes out.
it always does.
so, why don't you come with me?
man, Walter, you should have seen the look on your face when I handed you those gloves today.
Yeah, laugh it up, shorty.
just don't come crying to me when you need to get a beaker off the high shelf.
you know that beer I said I was going to buy you earlier?
not buying it. Nope. Not gonna happen.
Mr. Cardoza.
Hey, I'm glad I caught you. I had to tell somebody the good news.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
this woman found me out of the blue from this place called the Coastline Plaza.
said she got my name from my old school.
offered me a job managing an apartment building.
we'll be able to live in one of the apartments free of charge.
that is great news.
Yeah, my wife and my son are going to flip.
Hey, I'm happy for you, man.
I guess this is my second chance.
guess so.
take care, all right?
Yeah, man. Go catch some bad guys.
all right.
that have anything to do with that call you made earlier?
what call?
I'm going to kill him! - Okay, Sugar Bean...
dad, I'm not 11! - All right, you're overreacting.
overreacting? It's my wedding day.
the happiest day of my life!
I-I'm wearing a custom wedding gown, there are over a hundred guests waiting for me to make my grand entrance and Charlie is nowhere to be found.
God, how could he do this to me?
Ugh, everyone we know is in there.
what are they going to think?
who cares what they think?
Yeah, the groomsmen are missing, too.
they're probably all just laughing at me.
you know, maybe they're late, maybe they got a flat tire.
and why wouldn't he call?
no, he better be dead or dying, because if I see him I am going to wring his neck!
not a good way to start a marriage.
please, Dad, just find him!
all right, all right.
did you dial 911?
Yes. They're over there in the fountain.
I think they're dead.
I didn't let anybody touch anything.
preserve the crime scene.
I'm studying forensics online.
give me some room, people.
what the...
blood in the fountain's human.
it doesn't belong to these two.
they're nursing a couple of prizewinning hangovers.
could you keep your voice down, please?
looks like the blood came from their clothing.
and judging by the large volume of it in the water...
somebody is dead.
so, gentlemen, how did the blood get in the fountain?
we don't know.
who cuffed you together?
I've had blackouts before, but never like this.
sounds like a case of instant amnesia.
the kind brought on by, "I just did something big-time illegal and I don't want to get caught"
okay, let's start with your names.
what are your names?
I'm Jack Williams, this is Sean Anderson.
what is the last thing you remember?
we were with our friend, Charlie.
it was his bachelor party. We're his groomsmen and...
the three of us were just having a good time, you know?
I don't know how we ended up in the fountain.
where the hell's the groom?
today's his wedding.
Oh, my God, you don't think this could be his blood, do you?
I know why you want these.
Kim, we found some blood.
and we need to determine if it belongs to your fianc?
is Charlie dead?
I honestly don't know.
all right. Put your hands together.
wait, what are you doing?
you two are suspects in a possible murder.
you're going down to PD.
we already told you we don't remember anything.
well, not remembering doesn't mean not guilty.
put them in separate cars. I don't want them working out their stories.
and get their blood drawn for a tox screen.
did Charlie express any reservations about getting married?
I thought he stood me up.
I even wished he was dead.
but Charlie, he... he would never just take off.
tell me about the best man.
you know that Jack and Charlie didn't speak for an entire year.
Really? Why is that?
Charlie's nonprofit sued Jack's client.
won a big settlement.
what about Sean?
we went on one date in college, and he fell madly in love.
he just... he couldn't move on.
he never wanted me to marry Charlie.
the blood work came back on dumb and dumber.
Ah, tested positive for Scopolamine. "Devil's Breath."
it's actually a pretty popular drug in the L. A. club scene.
keeps you lucid, but it also hampers memory retention for the hours just before and after you take it.
especially when mixed with alcohol.
so they are telling the truth. They really don't remember.
no, guess we're going to have to rely on the evidence to tell us what happened last night.
in there.
Hey, you've got these weird green flakes on your pants.
almost look like, uh... confetti.
okay, let's empty your pockets.
I have no idea how this got here.
we can test the DNA, see if the blood is from our missing groom.
you remember being at a club last night?
no.
you got a stamp here from the club at the Ciel Bleu Hotel.
I don't even know what that is.
now we know where you guys stayed last night.
how about we take a little trip?
see if we can't jog your memory.
I don't know, Horatio.
so far I'm finding that every one of these blood samples has been contaminated.
contaminated by what?
contaminated by the chlorine in the fountain.
those two guys were soaked head to toe.
so the chemical was so strong it destroyed the DNA.
Yeah.
and it only takes an hour or so for the damage to be done.
and I don't think that there's a single usable piece of DNA here.
okay, we cannot confirm that the blood belongs to the groom.
no, not yet. I'm still looking.
I still have half of these samples to test yet.
wait a minute.
is that the piece of paper from the best man's pocket?
Yeah, it is. I couldn't get any DNA from it.
okay. Let's get it to Walter. There may be writing on it.
you think he's alive?
let's hope so.
Miami-Dade PD!
looks like a bomb went off in here.
I've got something.
wedding tuxes.
it's bowling balls.
what the hell were these guys doing?
I have found no evidence of blood.
Yeah, nothing to indicate Charlie King was murdered here.
I'm gonna radio down and have them send up Sean, see if he can help us with anything.
all right.
the doorman from the hotel nightclub said that the three of you charged your cover to this room.
does anything look familiar?
you know, I don't really remember much after we checked in.
what about these?
they yours?
don't look at me. I'm a married man.
there's some sort of a design logo on there.
what do you think that is, a teardrop?
I think that's supposed to be sweat.
that's the logo for the new strip club here in South Beach.
it's called Club Perspire.
Yeah, well, Walter was telling me about it.
Really?
are you Carmel?
uh, manager says that these belong to you.
Yeah, that's my color.
tell me, do you recognize any of these gentlemen?
because we found your undergarment in their hotel room.
Carmel... we're not trying to jam you up.
no one has to know you helped us out.
never seen that one.
Oh, those two-- they spent a couple hours here last night.
who wants 'em?
Hey, give 'em to my bro, Charlie.
he's getting married tomorrow.
no, Kim cannot catch me with these.
I took the groom to the VIP room, gave him a lap dance and left him there to clean up.
that's interesting, because this one had "Devil's Breath" in his system.
now, I understand that sometimes dancers use it to get bigger tips.
some girls may need to drug their men, but not me.
I give them multiple reasons to be generous.
so, you... are saying that you didn't pour them champagne from this bottle.
it'd be easy for us to compare the prints on this bottle with yours.
so what?
poured it.
I don't know anything about the "Devil's Breath," though.
all right.
well, we'll just have to check the video surveillance just to be sure.
take it up with my boss, Dimples.
all right, Dimples.
you heard her, let's go get the footage.
Yeah, no. How about you take it up with the boss and I'll see why Sean wasn't here with his pals.
fine.
we have a witness that says you weren't at the strip club with your buddies.
you have any idea where you were during that timeframe?
maybe my morals kicked in.
I never been a strip club kind of guy.
I'm not like Jack.
or maybe you were too busy preparing to kill the groom.
I would never kill Charlie. He's my best friend.
without him, I'm not three years sober.
without Charlie, you could have Kim all to yourself.
she told us about your date in college.
I had a crush on Kim.
we went out once, but that was before she and Charlie were engaged.
and then I met my wife.
we're getting ready to have a baby.
I'm over Kim.
and if she weren't so far into herself, she'd see that.
fast-forward through this, please.
you bet.
this is where the stripper takes the groom into the VIP room.
okay, now I've got all three video cameras from the three corners synched up.
I don't see where he leaves.
okay, hang on a second.
go back to that.
you see something?
zoom in on that, please.
now, who's that near the exit?
it's Kim.
what's she doing at the strip club?
catching her fianc? in the act.
Hey, honey, sorry we missed you.
we are on our way out.
it is just poker and martinis.
no strippers. I promise.
Yeah, Kim, no strippers.
seriously, no strippers, I promise.
I love you.
he lied.
the night before our wedding and he lied.
in my business, Kim, they call that motive.
no, please, wait, look.
I-I-I overheard Jack mentioning that club at the rehearsal dinner.
I... I tried to talk myself out of it, to just trust Charlie.
but... I went anyway.
come on, it's your last night of freedom.
you don't want any regrets.
next thing I know, some stripper is leading him into the back room.
so, you confronted him and you fought.
I was ballistic, but...
no. I didn't go after him.
what did you do?
I went back to my parents' house. I swear.
he can't really be dead, can he?
we don't know yet, Kim.
I want you to go home and stay local, okay?
Walter, the bloody piece of paper found in Jack's pocket -
what does it give us on the groom?
if I use haemasol, I think I can remove the blood.
hopefully, we'll be able to read what's on here.
fully understanding that we could lose the text, right?
ready for that.
okay.
the blood should be absorbed and dissipate.
and if I don't shake the tray too much, the ink should remain intact.
here we go.
Oh, man.
the haemasol's destroying some of the writing.
at the top. What is that, an address?
Julio Bail...
it's got to be bail bonds, right?
you think Jack was bailing out the groom?
there's only one way to find out.
Calleigh, find out who Jack Williams bailed out last night at Julio's Bail Bonds.
bro, this is a waste of time.
there's no way I bailed someone out last night.
Oh, there's no way, huh, bro?
Jackie was in here last night.
was this gentleman with him?
no.
just mi amigo Jackie.
stop calling me that.
that means our groom was at the strip club, but he never made it here.
Jackie was high as a kite.
he kept singing that... "Wanted: Dead or Alive" song.
and who was our American Idol bailing out?
him.
me?
I was in jail?
fort Lauderdale brought him in.
that explain why he wasn't in our system.
why the hell was I arrested?
trespassing, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest.
this wuss?
well, now we know why you didn't make it to the strip club.
bail was set real high. You must have really pissed someone off.
I don't even jaywalk.
I'm in my church choir. I don't piss people off.
well, you piss me off sometimes.
all right, listen, Frick and Frack, shut up.
who filed the complaint?
the hotel developer?
you are so screwed.
that guy owns half of Florida.
all right, I'm gonna call Horatio. I'm sure he's gonna want to talk to Clay Bennett.
Julio, how did Jackie here pay you?
Jackie told me this sob story about getting his friend out so they could make it to a wedding.
convinced me into taking a check.
this is a possible homicide.
is there any way I could take a look at that check, please?
uh, I still have it here.
Ineresting.
so, that is your signature, then?
Yeah. That check was a wedding gift.
I wanted Charlie to use it as a down payment on a house suitable for my daughter, not to bail out one of his boneheaded friends.
well, one of his friends, uh, Jack, actually used it.
you have any idea how he might've gotten a hold of it?
no, I left it with Charlie in his suite.
it wouldn't surprise me if he gave it to him.
Charlie does not know the value of a dollar.
Really? So, he's made some bad investments in the past?
investments? I wish.
he's-he's a community organizer.
I offered that boy a real job, he turned me down.
sounds to me like you're not too pleased with your daughter's choice.
well, you know, I'm a dad, Miss Duquesne. It's Miss Duquesne, right?
Yes.
so, nobody's good enough for my baby, but she loves him and that's what matters.
excuse me, Mr. Bennett?
my house man has your tip.
I'm trying to make my tee time.
you might want to push it.
Yeah, all three of these clowns were here.
how'd they get in?
hell if I know. They weren't invited.
they harassed my guests for autographs.
miss August, right?
Hey, could you sign...
they peed in my pool.
I may have had a drink.
then one of them grabbed a mic and started rapping while the other one did the human beat box.
all right, y'all! Let's kick it...
and I take it your people couldn't handle them.
Oh, my security guards escorted them out, and they came back.
I wanted them gone for good.
fort Lauderdale PD. Sorry. You're under arrest for trespassing.
get 'em out of here!
yes sir let's go
why is it that only Sean was arrested?
because the other two made a getaway in my limo.
so your car is missing.
Yeah.
grand theft limo.
Hey, the keys are in it!
did you file a police report?
I didn't realize it was gone until after the officer had left.
I sent my own guy after it.
and where is your guy now?
looking for my limo.
I need a BOLO on a black Cadillac limousine, tag number S-K-five-two-six, letter O.
air 20, suspect vehicle sighted, 13th and Ocean.
repeat, 13th and Ocean.
do not move! Miami-Dade Police!
open it.
definitely not our missing groom.
no. Looks like Bennett's security guard found the limo.
huh, Frank?
think one of the Three Stooges is capable of this brutality?
that's a very good question. Hang on a second.
you know the blood we found on our groomsmen, Jack and Sean?
it doesn't belong to the groom, does it, Natalia?
right.
well, I finally found a DNA sample that I could use from one of the back pants pockets.
how did you know?
well, I am looking at the source of the blood as we speak.
well, our groom could still be out there, and he could still be alive.
meet Mr. Tito Estevez of Always Protected Security.
think that company might want to think about getting a new name, don't you?
funny.
I found what look like epithelials under Mr. Estevez's fingernails.
he put up a fight with whoever did this.
I'll have Natalia run the DNA ASAP.
well, good. That'll tell us if the groom and his friends were involved at all.
you see this?
the green flake?
Yeah, that is so weird. I found the same thing on one of the groomsmen, Jack Williams.
you don't mind if I grab this, do you?
it's on the body...
so it's mine.
you territorial much?
snarky much?
it's protocol.
I'll bag it, tag it, and send it up to Trace.
the limo is all yours.
Thanks.
Hey, Walter, I got some more green flakes for you.
I'm good on green flakes.
doc Loman just dropped one off.
is that right? Well, Mr. Protocol found his on the body.
I found these in the limo.
at first I thought it was confetti, but, um, nah, it's not the right consistency.
no, it's heavier.
try paint.
I need to trade up to a different microscope.
the BX41 polarizes light with a filtering mechanism, so the BX41 it is.
come to Daddy.
this is weird.
could you sell me a better adjective then that?
cause my 84-year-old bubbe says "weird'
okay, fine.
one side of the flake is clearly cheap green paint that you could get at any art store.
but the other side looks like leaded paint.
with what could be azurite.
what does that even mean?
painters used this pigment prior to World War I.
no one uses it nowadays.
Walter, how do you know this stuff?
because I'm smart.
and my mom made me minor in art history.
anyway, my guess is, is that this flake came from an older painting.
maybe even a valuable one.
you know, Clay Bennett is an avid art collector.
Yeah.
you know, maybe Bennett wasn't so concerned about the stolen limo.
maybe his real concern was a valuable piece of art inside the limo.
well, if the groomsmen took it, what did they do with it?
want to take a ride?
well, the phone records show that Sean called this suite when he tried to get bailed out from jail.
so, since we know Charlie was nowhere to be seen, only stands to reason that Jack is the one that answered the phone call.
Ha-Hang on a minute.
Wait-Wait... Wait a minute.
hang on
bro, bro, bro, bro, you will not believe what I'm doing.
I'm deer hunting.
dude, I don't care.
I'm in jail. Get down here and bail my ass out.
What?! Jail?!
what jail?
I need $10, 000. Get down here.
all right, all right. I'm coming.
so you're thinking, after stealing Clay Bennett's limo...
then driving with Charlie to the strip club...
Jack must have come back here and stashed the painting.
the question is, where is it?
look at this room.
these guys think they were on tour with Metallica?
you a heavy metal fan?
more like Guitar Hero god.
Oh, Walter, take a look.
wouldn't he have hidden it?
I don't know. They were high.
maybe he hung it up and used it for target practice.
look at this.
there was a different painting here before. A larger one.
check out the discoloration.
this could be the source of our green fla
why would a multimillionaire like Bennett want a painting like this?
I mean, is it even valuable?
I don't recognize it.
I think there's something beneath this deer.
now, I can't tell for sure without my microscope, but this looks like the same pigment from the early 1900s.
with the azurite.
T-Ray 4000?
Yeah, should get underneath the cheap stuff, show us whatever it's hiding.
fluid image.
wild color choice, and the rich emotion...
kind of reminds me of a Cezanne, maybe something from the Fauvist movement.
it's a Matisse.
you've studied the French masters, too?
it's signed.
Oh, this piece was reported stolen from a private collection a few years ago.
so Bennett painted over it to prevent from getting caught transporting it.
what's something like this worth?
ve heaore to prevent from getting than $20 million.
that... and Charlie King's life.
get your hands where I can see 'em right now.
get on the ground.
let's go.
what the hell is this?
we have a warrant to search your premises.
Mr. Wolfe, tear it apart.
got it.
so, Mr. Bennett...
Charlie King?
who?
he took your painting, and you took him. Where is he?
stop it.
look, I admit I sent Tito to get my painting.
it was in my limo when those jackasses stole it.
I didn't kidnap anybody.
maybe a little jail time will jog your memory.
get him out of here.
no, no sign of Charlie.
all right.
let's keep looking.
the DNA evidence from under Tito Estevez's fingernails has come back.
any sign of our groom?
there is no DNA evidence that connects Charlie to Tito.
however, there is evidence that our vic tussled with both our groomsmen.
you think Jack and Sean killed Tito?
that's what the evidence is telling me.
look, we know three things.
we know that Clay Bennett sent Tito after the limo.
we know that Jack and Sean were covered in Tito's blood.
we also know that Jack and Sean had fingerprints in Tito's blood in the limousine.
well, I guess the question is, which one did it?
the car door was the murder weapon.
I know, ouch.
so, the head injury is the C. O.D.
precisely.
based on the consistent depth and placement of the bruises to the brain, this was done in quick succession.
one swing of the car door immediately followed by another, with the same amount of force and velocity.
all right, so, what you're saying is, this was the work of one person?
Yes.
is that a problem?
well, I just got off the phone with the S. A.'s office -
they won't bring charges unless we can tell them which one did it.
well, I mean, that would make sense.
Sean and Jack could point the finger at each other, and any decent defense attorney would walk them with reasonable doubt.
just a moment.
I was examining the crime scene photos when I was determining COD.
weren't there prints on the limo door?
Yeah, but they were just smudges-- nothing clear.
we've got the, um, victim's ear and cheek prints against the limo here, so we know what position he was in when he was killed.
may I see that?
it's not great, but you can tell by the handprint that the killer held the door here and braced himself against the car here.
but they're smudged.
wait. Hold on. Maybe not.
there's a finger pattern, and the smudge is the thumb to the little finger.
so, that means the killer would have braced himself with his right and swung the door with his left.
what?
about time.
just sign for your belongings, and you'll be free to go.
um, have you found Charlie?
come on. He took off.
wouldn't you?
Jack, you're left-handed.
so?
so, that must have made it easier for you to kill Tito Estevez.
what?
who's Tito?
you may have forgotten what happened last night, but the evidence always remembers.
clay Bennett's bodyguard caught up with the two of you guys after you bailed Sean out of jail.
Hey, Jack. Thanks for saving me some champagne.
you don't steal from Clay Bennett.
no, no, no, no, we didn't steal!
tell Clay we are sorry, and he can have his limo back.
you're not going anywhere till I get Bennett's painting back.
painting? What painting?
what did you do? Oh, my God!
I'm taking you straight back to Mr. Bennett.
and then, one of you used your left hand to slam Tito's head in the door.
you see, Jack, you were the one with his left hand free.
Jack, stop!
what are you doing?
Jack, stop. You'll kill him.
he's not breathing.
what the hell do we do now?
get him in the limo.
and then, you drove the limo to the pier.
both of us?
afraid so.
you're an accessory.
it was the Scopolamine.
I want to call my lawyer.
look, your lawyer is going to have access to all of our evidence.
perhaps he can argue diminished capacity.
if we really did this thing-- if we killed this guy-- could we have hurt Charlie, too?
we hope not.
just got a call from Club Perspire.
remember that stripper we've been watching? - Carmel?
Yeah, I got a tip from the owner-- she's quitting.
Really?
well, as far as we know, the strip club was the last place Charlie was seen before he disappeared.
Yeah, she was one of the last people to see him, too.
she's on the move.
I'll grab Calleigh, and I'll head over there.
I'll call to get a warrant for her place.
dimples.
where are you going, Carmel?
what?
I got this.
who's this?
this your daughter?
I have rights.
you can't look in there. We don't have a warrant.
I don't need a warrant.
what do we have here?
nothing.
nothing? It's Scopolamine.
you enjoy drugging your clients?
I'm sure your daughter is going to be just fine in foster care.
take her.
wait. Stop.
what do you want to know?
Charlie King-- where is he?
you'll make this other stuff go away?
talk.
all right, uh... some guy paid me to take him out back and put him in a car.
I thought it was a prank.
you liked the lap dance, right?
Yeah, well, this is going to be more fun.
I-I-I-I got to get back to my friends.
who was it?
I don't know his name.
some rich guy.
was it this man?
his name's Clay Bennett.
no. But it was dark. I didn't really see him.
there is a girl out there who is praying for her fianc to come home, and you can help her.
I know you remember something.
anything.
he was like 50.
and he was nervous, sweating.
I think he had a Southern accent.
he had a Southern accent?
Carmel Owens I. D.'d you when I showed her your picture.
she also said that you paid her to put Charlie in your car.
now, Mr. Hewitt, that's kidnapping.
what?
tell them they're wrong, Dad.
you called me from the strip club.
you were crying.
I had to do something.
he's at a strip club, Dad, with some stripper.
okay. Calm down, Kim. Calm down.
I want you to stop crying, all right? Just come home.
you can call this whole thing off.
I love him.
just come home, honey.
I asked Charlie to go away once. He just wouldn't listen.
what are you talking about?
so, the check you gave him wasn't a wedding present, was it?
it doesn't matter the amount, Mr. Hewitt.
I can't take this.
I love Kim.
I know my daughter.
you can't make her happy.
now, that's a blank check.
you fill out whatever amount you want, you walk away.
we're going to be family, Mr. Hewitt.
so, I'm just going to forget about this.
kim calls me, and she's crying, and he's hurting her.
and... they aren't even married yet, so I just... I lost it. I lost it.
you know, I drove down to the club.
I-I-I-I got... I got to get back to my friends.
give you a chance to, you know, change your mind about marrying him.
where is Charlie right now, and is he alive?
hang in there, Charlie. You're doing great, son.
he's got a weak pulse.
where is Kim?
she's waiting for you, Charlie.
take him to her.
she's waiting for you, son.
please, please, please, be okay.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
we have to take him, Miss.
thank you.
Hello?
Oh, my God!
help.
stay back, okay?
stay back.
get you out of here.
I need an ambulance at the corner of Orchard and Bloom.
and a fire truck, hurry!
all right, take it easy, take it easy
this looks ugly.
yeah One dead, one survivor.
any sign o? - No, fled the scene.
I've got patrol barricadin the neighborhood.
so I assume they'v got someone on his trail
Yeah. Horatio's canvassing the perimeter.
also, ere's a possibleitness.
a Good Samaritan was jogging...
pulled the victim's son out the back of the SUV.
possib saved his life.
is that the victim's son in the back of the ambulance
that's him.
Hey, what are you doing? You could be mpromisi evidence.
I n't nt i to be any worse.
Hangn cond.
I need a paramedic! She'aliv
Hangn there, sweetheart.
give herome om. Give herome om.
she gonnbe okay?
it's t soon to tell. Weelieve she w drivinthe other .
what? No, that's Lil my sister.
wait minute, he was in the Escalade th y? - Yes.
can I go? - Yeah, stay with her.
question is, o was driving the Bentley?
somebody with sothing to hide.
well, patrol just got back to us.
license plate belongs to a Billy Jones.
okay.
well, where the hell is he?
uh, he wasn't here.
reported it stolen last night.
that means somebody jacked the car, caused a crash to kill the woman and fled.
guy's a one-man crime spree.
whoa, whoa-- we don't even know which car caused the accident yet.
well, we know that innocent people don't flee the scene.
well, I can take the steering wheel back to the lab.
try it for prints.
Yeah, good idea.
hold up a second.
this seat is set back like mine is.
farther, even.
all right, so we must be looking for a big guy.
I think the word that you were looking for is "tall," Officer Cardoza.
we're looking for a tall guy.
about 6'4," at least.
you know, our Good Samaritan isn't looking so good.
people still asking you questions?
Nah, I'm just waiting for my sister to pick me up.
thought you said you were jogging.
you don't live around here?
you were the one driving the Bentley, weren't you?
okay. I own this very successful video game company.
and when people find out you have a lot of money, they'll use any excuse to sue.
are you admitting you were at fault in the accident?
no, I just wanted to consult with my lawyer.
well, you're going to need one that specializes in criminal defense; this is vehicular manslaughter.
no, no, no-- I was just making a turn.
they came out of nowhere.
how come you don't have a scratch on you?
I guess I was lucky.
lucky, huh? Not so much.
we know that that car was stolen.
I didn't steal it. I was returning it.
Yeah, see, you already used that Good Samaritan story once already.
look, my sister's dating the guy who owns the Bentley.
she got into a situation with him.
I was just returning the car.
well, I guess we'll need your sister to come in and verify that story.
sure.
bring him over to Holding.
don't touch me!
excuse me! Excuse me, where is my brother?! - Ms. Emparo, Ms. Emparo, it's okay. Calm down, all right?
I got it. Let's... - I want to see Victor.
okay, I have a few questions, then you can talk to him.
no, first I see him, then I answer your questions.
um, your brother... is in a lot of trouble.
Why?
he was driving a stolen car when the accident occurred.
you know anything about that?
I told you, let me see him first.
all right.
you need to have a seat.
your brother's being arrested for grand theft auto.
I'll have to call upstairs to see if I can get permission.
Victor didn't steal it.
I did.
but I didn't mean to.
it's my ex-boyfriend's car.
we were fighting. It got really heated, and I got scared.
I had to get out of there, so I took off.
in a car that didn't belong to you?
but I never meant to keep it.
I couldn't face Billy again, so Victor offered to return the car.
he was just trying to protect me.
we got a problem in here!
what happened?
uh, I don't know. We just found him like this.
what happened to him?
officer, what is going on?
he doesn't have a pulse. Get an EMT in here.
Yes, sir.
excuse me.
I think he's the largest one I've ever caught.
look, I don't understand.
how did he end up on the floor of the holding cell?
pretend this is Victor's head.
and I assume the gelatin is his brain?
which, before the crash, was a solid mass.
but then...
he suffered a diffuse axonal injury from the impact, which started an ischemic cascade that caused apoptosis leading to neuron necritis.
his head shook so hard, it broke his brain?
fractured with invisible cracks.
once Victor's brain stopped working, so did his lungs and heart.
but he was fine. I spoke with him after the accident.
he was completely coherent.
it's called "talk and die" syndrome.
the jostling rips the nerves apart, causing the brain cells to atrophy, which takes time.
he could've gone on for days before dropping dead.
this brings the body count on this accident to two.
man, it's insane.
I mean, the guy was standing right over there.
looked fine to me.
Yeah, I bet he thought he dodged a bullet.
anyway, Walter, last time I checked you can't charge a dead man with vehicular manslaughter.
looks like the family may still want to pursue civilly.
so Horatio wants all the "i's" dotted and "t's" crossed.
okay, you want me to tell you what happened, Walter?
Yeah.
Victor Emparo came out of the stop sign too fast into oncoming traffic.
end of case. Let's go eat.
Yeah, case isn't closed until we got some solid physical evidence, my friend.
I'm hungry.
and what I got here says the northern-most end of the debris indicates a point of impact approximately 12 feet, three inches from the point of reference.
and according to Victor Emparo's account, he was turning right from the southwest corner.
and judging from the, uh, damage done to the SUV here, it rear-ended the Bentley.
which means the SUV must have been coming from that way, over the bridge.
exactly.
Yeah, width of the mark is consistent with an SUV's tires.
only problem is, this tread is arcing away from the center of the road.
it's turning into the Bentley.
if somebody cuts you off, your natural reaction is to turn away, avoiding the crash.
how in the hell did you fit under there?
the skid mark under there indicates the SUV jammed on its brake before the impact.
our seven-footer definitely had some lies up his sleeve, but this doesn't look like one of them.
he didn't cause this accident.
but what caused the SUV to swerve so erratically?
maybe an animal?
a piece of debris?
maybe the mother was putting on makeup.
maybe she was talking on a cell phone.
okay, or maybe, and I hate to say this, some people like to add a little something-something to their morning coffee.
mom with a habit.
seen that before.
tell you what-- I'll, uh... call Dr. Loman, see if I can't get a rush on that tox report.
the blood ethanol level is 182 grams per hectoliter.
so where does that put us?
my math says . 115.
that's definitely over the legal limit.
she shouldn't have been behind a pottery wheel, much less a steering wheel.
Mr. Ballard, where was your family going this morning?
the kids were at a pep rally at Drake Point Beach.
my wife dropped them off and she picked them up when it was over.
any idea where she was between drop off and pick up?
I don't know.
she called, but I didn't answer.
I was-- I was in a meeting.
and I didn't think anything of it at the time.
but maybe-- maybe if I'd picked up, this wouldn't have happened.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Ballard-- did your wife have a drinking problem?
no. No, of course not.
why do you ask?
because her blood alcohol level was over the legal limit.
I mean, when we'd go out, she'd have a glass of wine with dinner, but that's it.
Karen would never drink and drive.
we have two teenagers living under our roof.
we don't even keep any liquor in the house.
doesn't mean she didn't drink.
I know my wife.
Mr. Ballard, I have an alcoholic in my family.
I know this is hard to hear.
no, this isn't hard.
it's just wrong.
it may be, it may not be, but it's my job to find out.
what about the other guy?
the one who stole the car-- shouldn't you be talking to him?
the other driver died in custody this morning.
we've also proven it wasn't his fault.
there has to be another explanation.
I'm sorry...
I know, I know, I know. You want to know where Karen Ballard was driving prior to the accident, I get it.
but this GPS is pretty banged up.
can we retrieve the data?
well, cross your fingers-- and your toes.
and my toes.
like I said, following the mother's movements will be no problem.
andrew Ballard and his wife claim they had no access to alcohol...
so where did they get it?
well, here's your bread crumb trail.
home... gas station...
Drake Point.
home... gas station...
sixth and Colton.
what is at Sixth and Colton?
the Rum Room.
I bet you can buy some alcohol there.
I bet you can too, Dave.
excuse me.
table or the bar?
actually, I just have a few questions for you about one of your patrons.
was this woman in here earlier today?
I remember her. Actually, she left her glasses here.
can you get 'em to her?
uh, sure.
do you remember what she had to drink?
she had a salty dog.
do you remember how many?
uh, just the one.
I think the guy she was with drank most of it, though.
Oh, really? Was this the guy she was with?
no.
her guy was more the rock climber, runner, not-so-corporate type.
well, that doesn't sound like her husband.
husband?
she didn't act like she had a husband.
I mean, they were practically doing it on the table.
and you're sure she just had the one drink?
positive.
they were in a hurry.
too much of a hurry to leave a tip, apparently.
okay.
well, thank you for your time.
tell you what, Karen's husband sure didn't know much about her.
in addition to the drinking problem, she was also having an affair.
Yes, and one drink wouldn't put her past the legal limit, would it?
I'm thinking maybe she had more after. A flask.
they went to a liquor store.
so maybe we have a false positive.
that's interesting.
so you're thinking because we collected her blood sample postmortem, that bacteria developed in the body creating ethanol?
that would give her an elevated blood level, wouldn't it?
Yeah, it would.
okay, then we're going to need to corroborate her blood tox with some other body fluid.
vitreous, maybe?
vitreous is the best indicator and would protect after death.
that's going to be a tough one.
she suffered severe cranial damage and the one eye we do have is badly compromised.
Yes, but it could prove her innocence.
let's look into it.
are you still working this scene?
Yep.
at point of rest, Karen Ballard was found in the driver's seat.
now I've just got to show that she was there during the collision.
you here to help?
no. Sorry.
I'm here to look for Karen Ballard's eyeball.
excuse me.
I know, but we can use it to confirm whether or not she was drunk.
Hey, Calleigh, don't let that husband's reaction trump your evidence.
I've worked my share of DUI's on night shift.
the family is always shocked.
tell me about it.
well, trajectory of the Escalade's roll threw the daughter's body off in those bushes over there.
all right, let's start that on.
eyeballs are like my kryptonite.
good to know.
okay, I'm going to take this back to Tom.
could you give this to Wolfe?
Yeah.
sorry.
Oh, gosh, Tom, what is it?
according to the vitreous humor, Karen Ballard's alcohol level was only at a . 02.
so our other blood sample was compromised.
she wasn't drunk.
Hey, H?
I got something from the brake pedal.
hit me.
driver slammed on the brake, causing the shoe's tread to transfer to the pedal.
okay, but can we confirm Karen Ballard was driving?
that's the thing.
the tread doesn't match her shoe.
Mr. Ballard?
I thought you might want some coffee.
thank you.
Mr. Ballard, I am very glad to tell you that we ran some additional testing this morning and your wife was not inebriated.
I was wrong.
I knew you had to be.
but how could you just make an accusation like that?
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
science led me to the truth, thankfully.
but also about some other things.
like what?
we found out that your wife wasn't driving this morning.
what? What are you talking about?
there was a pattern on the brake pedal, and it doesn't match your wife's shoes.
unfortunately, that means I'm gonna have to ask for, uh, your children's shoes.
so you think one of my kids drove? No.
Karen picked them up. She was driving.
I'm sorry, our evidence just doesn't support that.
well, it couldn't have been Lily-- she's only 14.
what about your son?
his license is suspended, and Karen would never let him get behind the wheel.
my daughter... is still unconscious, and Greg has been through so much already today.
why can't you just leave this alone?
Mr. Ballard, there are two people who died, and it is my responsibility to find out what happened.
but I am truly sorry.
Calleigh told me the husband was devastated.
can you blame him?
he just lost his wife, and now it looks like one of his kids caused the accident.
not to mention, he was being cheated on.
be careful with that information,'cause the husband was never told.
What?!
the guy doesn't know the worst of it?
it wasn't pertinent to the case.
look, his wife just died.
what good would it do to let him know his wife was also cheating on him?
wouldn't you want to know?
Yeah.
Hey, I think we got a match.
the last time I drove was, like, two weeks ago.
I was out with some friends. We were racing.
Oh, shoot!
I got pulled over, and that's why my license got suspended.
Yeah, well, that... and the marijuana they found in the car.
Yeah.
who was driving today?
my mom.
even though she didn't have her glasses?
Yes, she was fine.
I was asleep in the back, and then suddenly, sh-she just swerved.
I don't know why she swerved, she just did.
why would I lie about this?
you're aware that a man lost his life, right?
I know how bad this was.
but you got to believe me, I was not driving.
there you go.
how you holding up?
when can I go?
well, until your ex verifies your story, we have to hold you for grand theft.
Victor was always saving me in these situations.
now...
that kid, he's injured.
was he involved in the accident?
I'm sorry, I can't talk to you about an ongoing investigation.
was it his fault?! - Marta...
was he driving the car that killed my brother?!
don't make things worse; keep your voice down.
I won't keep my voice down!
he killed my brother, and he's walking out of here!
no, we don't know what happened, Marta, but we will find out-- that I can promise you.
sit down.
Hey, Calleigh.
please tell me you have good news.
I wish I did.
I ran the soles of the son's sneakers through the FTIR.
take a look.
come to find there's a softening agent mixed in with the plastic.
and soft plastics don't require high-speed impact to melt.
Oh, come on-- that means the tread evidence on our brake pedal is equivocal.
Yep. The transfer from the son's sneakers could have happened from slamming the brakes on a different day.
that's what he told Horatio.
the one exception to the rule.
just when you think you got something figured out, they throw you another curveball.
so what now?
we find out once and for all who was driving that Escalade.
so, does anybody want to tell me why we brought the lab down to the garage?
if we're gonna figure out who was driving, we need to trace the path of our passengers during the accident.
basically, I tested all their clothes for nitrates, and they all came back positive.
which means they really tumbled around during the crash.
so the best way to figure out who was where at the time of impact is with fiber plastic fusions.
what is that?
car crashes create so much speed and energy that the friction can cause fibers and patterns to actually fuse with the car's plastic components.
well, that's gonna be tough to sort, huh?
with all those bodies rolling around in there.
you afraid of a challenge, Wolfe?
all right, let's everybody pick a seat, and then we'll record every contact with a corresponding color.
the mom is red dots, the son is blue, and the daughter's green.
drop it, Wolfe.
what?
you need diffuse light to distinguish FPF's.
and... you'll need one of these.
look closely for abraded surfaces.
transfers can be tough to spot.
you know, a nice young man was promoted from the night shift, and now he thinks he's God's gift to forensics.
shame to see.
the son is all over the backseat.
the kid's flopping around like a fish out of water.
well, that leaves... the daughter or the mother in the driver's seat.
well, the mother left transfer on the E-brake.
she was also found behind the steering wheel.
but the only way to actually confirm she was driving is to find evidence of the mother below the steering wheel.
right, that's the only place none of the other passengers would have come in contact with during the roll.
I think maybe our best bet is to take a look at the panel for the steering column.
all right.
thank you.
anything?
not yet.
Oh, wait a minute
got a pinched fiber.
Walter, there's no crack in the plastic. How did the fiber get stuck in there?
bag that? - Yeah.
well... the plastic splits when the passenger impacts with it.
the fiber gets caught, then when the passenger shifts, the plastic recovers its original shape, as if nothing ever happened.
it's crazy, right?
it's not from the mom's pants.
I got nothing here.
the daughter was driving.
mom said I could drive.
as long as I drove slow.
why wasn't Mom driving?
she didn't have her glasses, and Greg's license was suspended.
so he couldn't.
she tried to call you, but you didn't pick up.
it was such a short drive home.
Lily, what do you remember about the accident?
mom was sitting next to me.
Greg was in the back.
take it easy, Speed Racer.
eyes front.
gosh. Can we turn on the radio?
no. It'll distract you from the road.
mom, it's okay. We're, like, the only car out here.
ease up, ease up on the gas.
mom, I'm fine. I'm not even going fast.
okay, okay.
we drove across the bridge, and a gator came into the road.
I swerved to avoid it, but the car was acting weird.
the car was so heavy, and I couldn't turn the wheel.
this is all my fault.
no, baby, no.
you know, Lily, I'm not so sure about that.
thought the daughter admitted to driving.
Yes, she did.
she said... when she lost control of the car, the car felt heavy.
could be operator error. She's, uh-- I don't know-- young, inexperienced.
Yes.
it could be equipment failure.
let me see that light.
steering fluid is very, very low.
that could've contributed.
so one of the parents forgot to top off the fluid.
get them on negligence, maybe.
could explain why she never corrected.
and without the power steering, she would've felt the full weight of the car, wouldn't she have?
H, take a look at this.
this is from the steering system.
hose is punctured.
could've been a slow leak.
Mr. Wolfe, that's not from normal wear and tear.
that was cut.
somebody intentionally tried to hurt this family.
not the family, the mother.
remember, she was having an affair, right?
boyfriend checked out; he's clean.
I'm not talking about the boyfriend.
how many different ways are you going to continue to attack me and my family today?
I'm merely following the evidence, Mr. Ballard.
and what evidence is telling you that I would sabotage my own wife's car?
you are the one that had access and motive.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
you should check your facts.
well, here's a fun little fact.
your wife had a boyfriend on the side.
what? Who?
you can drop the act.
she met him this morning before she picked up the kids.
and that didn't sit too well with you, did it?
I swear... I had no idea.
Really? Then why'd you lie to us?
we checked your office. You weren't there today.
I didn't want to admit that I missed my wife's last phone call for no good reason.
I told her that I was working this morning, but...
I was... I was watching a stupid football game.
so if we looked in the garage, your garage, for the tool that cut the power steering line, are you saying we wouldn't find it?
search whatever you want.
I would never hurt Karen.
who would want to?
I don't know.
seems there were a lot of things I didn't know about my wife.
it certainly does.
you see, the problem, Mr. Ballard, is you're still our lead suspect.
okay, these are all the tools from Andrew Ballard's garage.
Ryan, why don't you swab for steering fluid?
Calleigh and I will examine each for any unique characteristics to match that steering line.
I have to say, I think we're barking up the wrong tree.
I mean, let's face it, even if the dad had an ax to grind, would he really endanger the lives of his own children?
I've seen it all, Calleigh.
not a lot of it makes sense.
I feel for those kids. They've been through so much today.
and now Lily is facing vehicular manslaughter charges.
what's that smell?
is that...
that's marijuana.
why you smelling me?
you have anything to say?
I didn't do anything. I just hung up those special lights you told me to.
there's not supposed to be anything flammable under the hood.
those lights are metal halide.
they can heat up to a few hundred degrees.
Oh, yeah. That's definitely marijuana.
Yeah, it is.
that is a funny place to hide drugs.
it must be really jammed down there.
let's get it out before we lose our evidence.
that is a tight... place to...hide something like this.
you know, whoever did that could've cut the steering line in the process.
Greg Ballard was caught with marijuana.
that's when his license was suspended.
I knew I could score some weed at the pep rally.
it was just for me, personal use.
no, that wasn't a recreational amount. You were gonna sell it.
only to my friends.
Greg, possession and dealing and trafficking are felonies.
I'm about to place you under arrest.
you understand that, don't you?
look, my parents... got real strict after I got in trouble.
always checking my room, my bag.
I figured the only way I could get it home was to hide it under the hood.
Hey, Mom, uh, oil is fine.
okay.
you hid the weed yourself.
Yeah, this morning.
Greg... you inadvertently cut the cable.
that's why your sister couldn't turn the wheel.
okay, so you-you mean...
my-my mom is-is dead because of me?
Greg, I'm sorry, but it looks that way.
but, I... I... I didn't think things could get this bad.
I'm sorry.
could you at least let my sister know it wasn't her fault?
I'll do that.
I will, son.
glad to see you're out.
I heard you guys talked my ex out of pressing charges.
thank you.
well, I'm sorry. For everything.
somehow I thought if I knew who caused the accident, it would make it better, make this feeling go away.
I should've never let Victor return that car.
I should've never drove it off in the first place.
no, hey, this wasn't your fault.
what happened to your brother was an accident.
just a series of random events that ended tragically.
you didn't cause it.
like you said yourself, your brother was always trying to save you.
well, this time he saved somebody else, too.
he pulled that kid from the wreck.
your brother was a hero.
that's how you should remember him.
all right?
I didn't hire you for aquarium security, Wolfe.
you know, those are box jellyfish?
they can kill you.
Yeah, well, you're supposed to be looking for the killers in the crowd.
Yeah, I feel like at ten grand a plate, there aren't many, uh, murderers in the bunch.
don't let the clothes fool you.
I know you're new to the security beat, but if you want to move your way up from temp, you need to learn to ID the bad guys no matter the camouflage.
Oh, okay, all right.
well, do you see any bad guys in the crowd?
I do right there.
why him?
the way he moves.
looks like he's stalking prey.
Yeah, that one's trouble.
uh, I'll tell you what, boss.
I'll go follow that one.
may I have your attention, please?
everyone, thank you. Thank you.
look, if you've had as much to drink as I've had, you're, uh...
you're probably not going to remember what I'm gonna say, so I'm gonna make this short.
you're welcome.
uh, Miami Tomorrow couldn't provide textbooks to our city's neediest children without your support, but I would also like us all to thank Renovation Warehouse.
they've been our biggest contributor, and, uh, they...
excuse me, sir, I'm gonna need to see some ID
what are you doing here?
I'm, uh... I'm moonlighting. I need a little extra cash.
but you don't seem to.
look at this tux. You look gorgeous.
this thing is rented. I'm here as somebody's plus one.
is that right?
looks like you're, uh, somebody's minus one now, pal.
Oh, I don't even know who that is.
you don't?
she sure seems to know who you are.
help me! Help me!
help me!
this is Wolfe! Call 911!
I'm headed to the balcony!
sir, hold on! Hold on, sir.
help me!
ladies and gentlemen, move over to that side of the room.
let's go! Move! Move! Move!
help me! Help me!
all right, listen up. I'm with MDPD.
I need everyone to gather next to the stage.
no one's leaving here until an officer takes your statement. Understood?
let's go! Move!
careful, gentlemen.
we need to preserve his injuries.
so, our victim is Jeff Lofton.
I would say, based on his uniform, he's a custodial employee of Renovation Warehouse.
must have been here working the party.
look at all these welts.
he was stung hundreds of times.
this may be an obvious question, Tom, but is that what killed him?
no doubt.
Chironex fleckeri are the most venomous beasts in the world.
Ryan said they swarmed him.
they would have.
unlike most jellyfish, box jellies are predatory.
once he hit the water, they hunted him down.
their tentacles have over 500, 000 nematocysts.
and nematocysts are stingers?
and each one injected venom, causing immense pain.
with so much in his system, he had a cardiac arrest.
would you excuse me?
so, Horatio wanted me to get a statement from you about today.
why don't we start with, um, who's the girl?
what girl?
the girl you were stalking.
okay, you and Ryan really need to stop texting so much.
what's wrong?
you were stung.
Yeah, it's nothing.
well, they're poisonous. We should get you to the ER.
no, we shouldn't. I've been stung by jellies surfing before.
I just need to find some vinegar.
acidic acid neutralizes the poison.
will balsamic do it?
Yeah. Pour it on.
Yeah. That's better.
I think somebody should look at that.
tell you what, okay?
I'll go home, I'll change, I'll put a bandage on it, and you stop asking me about the women in my life.
cool?
all right, tough guy. It's your arm.
see what I mean? Something happened up here before Lofton went over, and this glass is pretty thick.
someone had a full head of steam to get through it.
Walter, this railing is too high for somebody to fall on their own.
we've got blood here, here and there.
bet it's from our vic's fingers.
that's probably why he couldn't hold on.
help me! Help me!
this railing-- it's been wiped clean.
if we find any prints, they'll be fresh.
gentlemen, may I help you?
hang on a second. Excuse me.
you can't be up here.
I'm Max DeSalvo. I'm the CEO.
I don't think I need clearance to be anywhere.
Mr. DeSalvo, this is an active crime scene.
it's also my building.
so then, Mr. Lofton, our victim, worked for you.
Yeah, he was with our maintenance department for 15 years.
he always worked our parties.
Walter, would you hit those pants with the light, please?
what are you doing?
it smells like ammonia.
maybe some kind of cleaner.
maybe... like this cleaner.
Mr. DeSalvo, were you up here today?
well, yeah, my office is just right here.
I was... I was in a hurry to get downstairs.
my wife says it is rude of me to leave her alone.
great.
it's a $1, 000 tux.
sorry, Mr. DeSalvo.
but that was before the party, and...
I don't know what all this is.
H? - Yeah.
I got a palm print here, sir.
well, if I can help you gentlemen.
you can.
I need your palm print.
left palm, please, sir.
you can place your hand firmly on the paper.
thank you.
now wait downstairs, please.
baby wipe?
you smell like a dinner salad.
Yeah, yeah, all right. So did you find anything other than jelly bites?
I'm still in the prelim, but I can already see Mr. Lofton has a lot more wear and tear than a 40- year-old should.
wore this brace on his right knee.
the man could barely walk.
well, 15 years of maintenance work takes its toll.
I was just about to take a few infrared pictures to see if anything else did.
the welts obscured them, but he is covered with subdermal hematomas.
and this isn't high-velocity trauma from the fall.
more like the bar room brawl variety.
okay, that confirms our theory that he was in a fight before he went over.
it's sloppy.
no vulnerable areas were targeted.
whomever he was fighting didn't really know how to.
the only reason they had a leg up on Lofton was...
because he had a bad one.
so, basically you're saying that this could've been anyone.
sorry.
Yeah.
ms. Lofton?
Hi, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.
I just wanted to come and see you and let you know that you don't have to worry about coming down.
we're gonna call you as soon as we know anything about what happened to your husband.
I came down to get Jeff's death certificate.
ms. Lofton, your husband's only been gone a couple hours.
I know.
but-but I heard somewhere that you need it before you can get the money from the life insurance.
I-I was looking through his stuff and, uh, I-I saw something about a policy.
okay. I'm just going to be perfectly honest with you.
life insurance companies sometimes take several months to pay out a claim, and this is not what you need to be worrying about right now.
and how am I supposed to pay for all the bills without his income?
I have three kids.
Jeff took care of all this.
none of this makes sense to me.
are these your insurance papers?
Yeah.
okay, why don't I take a look, see what's inside, and maybe I can expedite things.
you would do that?
Yeah.
you should be with your children, not worrying about this right now.
did you get a hit?
no, not yet.
a couple names left to go.
maybe I should get a print of your palm.
you were there, too.
Yeah, but I didn't lie about why I was there.
you told me you were a plus one.
you paid to be there. You're a donor.
no wonder that tux looked so good on you.
it wasn't rented. You owned it.
it was for a good cause.
$10, 000 a plate on a cop's salary? I sure hope so.
you know what, Wolfe? If you were this curious about the case, you'd have solved it by now.
I haven't gotten a single hit off the list yet.
I'm going to go see what Calleigh's doing.
okay, what angle are you working?
well, it's not really an angle.
I offered to look at Lofton's insurance policy for his widow, but it turns out the only thing I can find is a change of address form.
she's already asking for the insurance?
she have an alibi?
you know, I was wondering the same thing, but it really seems to me like she's just a stay-at-home mom who's in over her head.
Yeah, I bet an insurance policy payout would fix that.
did she bring this in?
she did. Why?
because Mrs. Lofton's palm print would be on it.
where you going?
Hey, you remember how she was holding it?
was it like this?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Ryan. Where's the ninhydrin?
uh, it's over there.
you know she wasn't on the guest list.
doesn't mean she wasn't there.
compare this with the, uh, print you found on the balcony.
well, they both have transverse palmars. That's pretty rare.
the bifurcations and the crossovers match.
if I was in court...
I'd say she was on that balcony.
you want to call her, or should I?
you think I pushed Jeff?
can you think of any other reason why your handprint would be there?
Yeah. Because I was.
but it was earlier, before anybody else was.
I was helping Jeff clean before the party.
and so, you left before the party started?
we couldn't let anybody else know I was helping.
warehouse would fire him if they knew he couldn't do his job.
he had a bad knee. ACL.
what about your health insurance?
their health plan doesn't cover anything.
we had to buy his brace out of our own pocket. $200.
ms. Lofton, is there anyone who can corroborate your story?
hate to say this, Mrs. Lofton, but right now you're the only one who benefits from your husband's death.
I'm sorry, we're going to have to ask you to stay here with the officer.
would you make a phone call for me?
I was wondering if I could talk to somebody regarding my Allied Pledge life insurance policy.
uh, my name's Jeff Lofton.
uh, policy number...
Yeah. It is C-F-10983.
uh, social is 905-36-8217.
Yeah, yeah, no, I can hold.
why am I pretending to be a dead guy?
because the insurance company will only talk to the policy holder.
probably already know he's dead.
no, they don't. Tom hasn't filed the death certificate yet.
okay, look, if she took out the policy then for sure she's guilty.
but I don't think she knew anything about it until this morning.
Yeah, no problem.
no, I was just wondering, um-- who originally took out the policy?
was it my wife Deedee?
and who's the beneficiary?
no, no, that... That's it.
okay. Thanks.
she didn't take out the policy, did she?
no, it was his company, Renovation Warehouse.
lieutenant, Renovation Warehouse takes out life insurance policies on all of its employees.
I don't see what this has to do with Jeff's death.
the bottom line is, anybody who benefits from that policy is my suspect.
well, then you're going to have to arrest the entire company.
it's a very common policy, Lieutenant.
they're called dead peasant policies.
it's an unfortunate name, but completely legal.
so why didn't you inform the employees? Lofton's wife didn't even know.
Why? 'Cause they-they're for the company's protection.
we've invested in Lofton.
this policy offsets our loss.
what you should've invested in was a decent healthcare plan.
do you have a point, Lieutenant? - As a matter of fact, I do.
if you have nothing to hide I want you to open your books to me.
sure, you can see Lofton's employee files.
but other than that, everything's confidential.
that's a 5, 000-gallon water tank.
well, we're running out of evidence. Where else do you suggest we look?
we know that the killer was up on the balcony.
Yeah, when the body falls, the evidence falls with it.
so... let's get to work.
so, uh, I checked the filter.
nothing out of the ordinary in it, except for about three dollars in change and a thong.
well, I think the thong would be considered out of the ordinary.
I agree. But, uh, I doubt it belongs to the killer.
find anything in here?
no, not yet.
what about inside the coral? - Inside?
what are you talking about? Breaking open the coral?
they're little filters.
okay. When the EPA comes after us I'm going to tell them it was your idea.
what is that, fish scales?
Yeah, of the man-made variety. Sequins off of a dress.
don't know that that helps us much.
there were a lot of ladies in black sequin dresses at the party.
I guess we'll have to invite them to our own party.
all right, next.
it's not what we're looking for. Thank you.
thank you, though.
next.
pretty dress.
got a few black sequins missing there and there.
can we keep this for our investigation?
Really?
Yeah. You'll get it back. I'll give you a receipt.
I better not see a picture of you wearing it in Ocean Drive.
thank you.
don't come between a girl and her dress.
in... I mean, you know what I...
next, please.
excuse me.
next.
well, well.
when I saw you at the fund raiser, I couldn't believe it.
so, you followed me all the way from L. A?
you probably put this whole thing together just so you could harass me again.
I'm working a case, Anna.
I know exactly what case you're working.
we called every woman who was at the party.
look, if you'd like to talk to her instead of me, that's totally fine.
here.
wait.
this isn't what we're looking for.
I'm not surprised.
it's always a dead end with you, isn't it?
got a little history there?
okay. It's business, not personal.
it is for her.
if I promise to explain to you over drinks, will you please get everyone to stop giving me the third degree?
drinks?
Yeah.
next.
okay. These appear to match.
let's see.
Nope. That is a glossy octagon.
we are looking for a circle with a flat finish.
they look the same to me.
what, did you skip colors and shapes in kindergarten?
okay, fine.
that means we don't have the dress that these sequins came off of.
no, and it looks like we're missing one.
a dress?
a girl.
Caroline Berston-- she never came in, according to this file.
all right, well, I'll call patrol and have them bring her in.
there's the guy from Renovation Warehouse with the files.
fastest I've seen a corporation respond to a warrant.
maybe they're not trying to hide anything.
maybe that's what they want us to think.
Hello, Officer. I'm Garrett Yates.
I'm an actuary at Renovation Warehouse.
Mr. DeSalvo asked me to personally deliver this to you.
appreciate that.
I think you'll find we're in full compliance with the warrant's orders.
you now have all of our records concerning employees, earnings and insurance claiMs.
all in one box?
more like 102.
three, counting that one.
I hope there's more than just you two.
there's over half a ton of paper that you guys asked for.
I don't know what you're looking for, but you're going to need help finding it.
I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need.
Horatio, take a look at the monitor.
I inputted all the life insurance claims filed by Renovation Warehouse in the past five years.
now, this is countrywide.
look at where it spikes every year.
spikes every year in June.
when is the end of their fiscal year?
Bingo-- June.
okay, so, let's focus on all the claims in June.
Mitchell Kurwood, 39...
drowned in his own pool in Michigan.
okay.
I got two ladies here.
one's upstate New York. Died in a car accident.
the other is in Vegas. Fell down some stairs.
all right, you guys, get this.
Fargo. 31-year-old security guard fell off the Renovation Warehouse parking structure.
and this one's a local. Broward County.
a 23-year-old receptionist hanged herself by her pool.
okay.
all right, so we've got four accidents, one suicide.
that brings us to a total of a cool nine million easy profits for Renovation Warehouse.
all of them Renovation workers.
certainly would put the company in the black, wouldn't it?
add 500 grand to that-- Jeff Lofton's death could easily have been made to look like an accident.
Yeah, but we know it wasn't, so maybe these others aren't as they appear to be, as well.
here's what we do. Let's start with the suicide, okay?
Hannah Wilcox, Broward County.
hold on here.
are you guys saying this company is possibly killing its own employees to collect their insurance money?
that's exactly what I'm saying.
was this, uh, Hannah Wilcox's residence?
I'm Evan Wilcox, her brother. Who's asking?
MDPD.
were you, uh, living with your sister when she passed?
you mean killed herself. Call it what it was.
uh, this was our parents' house. Hannah left it to me.
finally getting around to moving in now.
what do you guys want?
we're reopening the investigation.
it's a little north of your jurisdiction, isn't it?
do you know her employer took out an insurance policy on her?
look, I'm not interested in collecting any money, if that's what this is about.
well, that's a good thing, because it turns out you're not the beneficiary.
renovation Warehouse got the million dollars.
they made money when she died?
that's correct. That may have had something to do with her death.
are you saying she was murdered?
we need to exhume her body to determine that, and we need your permission.
that might be a problem.
why is that?
she donated her body to science.
Walter Simmons, MDPD.
we're here for Hannah Wilcox.
he means body #13349.
the dean said you'd be coming.
I'm afraid I'm not going to be of much help.
our director of bequeathals handles the records.
students aren't allowed to know anything about their cadavers.
in fact, they're encouraged to give them new names.
good thing we brought a photo.
it's the lady in the picture.
well, class is now in session. Follow me.
it's Hannah.
I'll go get the gurney.
Why? We have everything right here.
you want to do the autopsy now?
gloves, please.
all right.
so, Broward's autopsy listed the cause of death as asphyxia by hanging.
ligature marks are at an inverted V under the jaw, just above the thyroid cartilage.
scalpel.
thyroid cartilage, also known as the Adam's apple in male anatomy, is still intact, as is...
the hyoid bone above it.
we learned in pathology that's consistent with a suicide by hanging.
top marks.
but this... this gives me pause. Take a look at her eyes.
what do you see?
looks like hemorrhaging.
it's called petechial hemorrhaging.
which is typical of manual strangulation, not a hanging.
that's a big miss, isn't it?
I don't fault Broward's M. E.
distinguishing a hanging from strangulation is very difficult.
so, there's a chance she was murdered.
chance" being the operative word.
it could be a strangulation made to look like a hanging, but as of now, the evidence is equivocal.
but there's no way to know for sure.
too bad you can't travel back in time to the original crime scene.
Tom, you're a genius.
Hey, see you back at the lab.
I don't understand. You got a look at her body. Why are you doing this?
we believe the autopsy may be inconclusive.
so, Broward PD was right about it being a suicide?
well, we have an open mind.
so, you're going to recreate her death?
I would, uh... I'd wait inside if I were you.
ready? - Yeah.
what do you see?
I got a distinct rope burn up here, sir.
okay. Lace it across the beam.
wait a minute. I got another rope burn across a different beam.
which one did she hang from?
that's a very good question, Walter. Lace it across the second beam.
all right, so, with the rope positioned at two points, it creates a mechanical advantage.
should make it easier to lift up the body.
the rope burns were caused from someone pulling her up.
she didn't hang herself.
she was dead already.
she had ligature bruises on her neck.
the rope wouldn't have left a mark if she was already dead.
so, they used a rope to strangle her, Walter.
that means Broward County neglected to take epithelials, doesn't it?
sit down, Mr. Yates.
no, no, no, no.
you can't prove I didn't touch that rope somewhere else.
someone could've stolen it from my shed.
no, we know that you strangled her, because we have DNA that proves it.
okay, here's the thing: you're going to go away for Hannah Wilcox's murder, there's no doubt about it.
there isn't a jury in the world that is going to find any sympathy for a corporate executive who's killing for a profit sheet.
and you're not going to last one day in prison, because executives are right down there on the food chain with pedophiles.
you can make this smoother for yourself.
but you get one chance.
how?
have a seat.
if you tell us everything, we will offer you protection.
I have got a list of all of the policyholders who were employees that have died in the last five years.
circle all the names you're responsible for.
let me ask you a question, Mr. Yates. You're just the numbers cruncher here, right?
so you didn't come up with this plan on your own. Who's behind this?
you'll tell the judge that I helped you?
Yes.
my CEO, DeSalvo. He said,"We have the policies, why not use them?
he told me I'd have "lifetime employment" if I did this.
do you have anything that can prove that?
like a little trail of bread crumbs? DeSalvo's not that stupid.
you forgot to circle Jeff Lofton.
because I had nothing to do with that.
I swear.
excuse us for a moment.
this guy just gave us half a dozen murders. What's the problem?
here's the thing: if we don't have any hard evidence, it's going to be DeSalvo's word against his.
well, then our CEO walks.
exactly.
and we still have to figure out who killed Jeff Lofton.
Hey, did you get my message?
Yeah, patrol found our missing girl.
Yeah, they also picked up her dress. They found it at her apartment.
okay. Well, I'll take her.
I'll take the dress.
do you know who I work for?
I'm the executive assistant to the CEO of Renovation Warehouse.
they have a team of lawyers who will help me, because I haven't done anything wrong.
well, why didn't you return our phone calls?
I was busy. I had errands to run.
Really?
sequins match the dress.
you see, these sequins here were found with our murder victim.
they came off of your dress.
just tell us what happened.
I don't want to lose my job.
I'm not saying any more, okay?
well, Caroline, you may want to rethink your company loyalty.
what's this?
that is an insurance policy that your company took out on the guy who got murdered.
they also have one on you.
your company killed Lofton so they could collect the insurance money.
which means, you could've been the one in that aquarium.
no, it wasn't like that.
I was with Max.
and I'm guessing you weren't taking a memo.
someone's going to catch us. We should get back to the party.
so you don't want me to give you, uh, your year-end bonus?
are these actual diamonds?
we had a very good year.
what the hell is this, DeSalvo?
you say the company can't pay for decent health care.
but it can afford diamonds for a secretary?
go down and order me a drink.
I went downstairs after that.
okay, how long after that did Lofton fall in the tank?
couple minutes, maybe.
but there's no way Max killed that janitor.
I think we'll let Mr. DeSalvo speak for himself.
step onto the butcher paper, please.
what is all this?
if you pushed Jeff Lofton off the balcony, there will be evidence of him on you.
I told you that my run-in with him was before the party.
but a witness places you on the balcony before he was pushed.
and by "witness," you mean Caroline?
all right, we're going to start with your clothing, so take your jacket off.
why don't I save you guys the trouble?
I may have told a little lie.
I was up on the balcony with your witness when Lofton arrived.
I ask her to leave, and he went Christian Bale on me.
you guys won't pony up decent health care for me, but the new girl gets a diamond bracelet?
that young lady work very hard, mister.
Mr. what?
I've busted my ass for this company for 15 years, and you don't even know my name?!
help me! Help me!
if you pushed him off the second floor, that's murder.
I had no choice. He attacked me.
he did this to me.
the pattern of the bruising matches Lofton's knee brace.
so you're claiming self-defense?
you know, all you've got is circumstantial evidence, Lieutenant.
and my story's just as good as yours.
we also believe that you are responsible for the insurance policy murders.
Really?
it's my understanding that one of my actuaries confessed to that.
his word against mine.
and again, I like my story better.
take him, please.
I'll be out before sunset.
he's right.
everything we got could support self-defense, and we've got nothing connecting him to the other murders.
these things have a way of working themselves out.
did he come?
it's time.
fighting is escalating here in Afghanistan.
the U. S. suffered three casualties today.
settle down.
settle down.
it's the governor.
the Defense Department has yet to name today's casualties, but at this time we can confirm they come from 22nd Infantry Division.
I understand.
Hello?
if you answer that, I will kill you.
it's the State's Attorney's Office.
he has other investigators.
I know. I don't start for a week.
I mean... must be important.
it's Delko.
the S. A. needs you in as soon as possible.
I'll make coffee.
Yeah, um... all right.
this aired last night, and the governor caught it on TV.
Mrs. Russo, as we count down the hours till Dr. James Bradstone's execution, we're revisiting his trial from 15 years ago.
now, you were an eyewitness?
I was right over there, in my kitchen.
I looked out the window.
I was able to see into their bedroom.
Dr. Bradstone stabbed his wife, again and again and again.
you were making tea there in your kitchen?
but you can't see the Bradstones' bedroom from there; there are trees.
the prosecutor told me the same thing.
let me understand this... the prosecutor told you to say you saw the Bradstone murders from your living room, when actually you were there in your kitchen?
the defense attorney is now challenging the validity of the witness's initial statement, and alleging prosecutorial misconduct.
Bradstone's the "Killer Doc." He killed his wife and daughter.
Yes, and left his seven-year-old son for dead.
I remember the case, gentlemen.
he's been on death row for 15 years. He has exhausted his appeals.
we were minutes away from giving this bastard what he deserves, the governor grants him a stay.
Yes, but you were the prosecutor.
was there misconduct?
what? Of course not.
she was a solid witness for us at the time.
she made our case.
but after this interview, she seems... confused, at best.
the governor's threatening to overturn the conviction.
and we have 24 hours to prove that what Ms. Russo saw was accurate.
or a killer walks free.
nice going.
Eric, why don't you start by telling us about the victims.
sure. Got, uh, Sarah Bradstone.
she's, a mother, wife, former nurse, a PTA president.
she was 28.
come on, you guys!
you got her daughter, Caitlin Bradstone-- she was five.
and their son, Todd, seven.
he survived.
you were the first responder 15 years ago.
did Todd see anything?
no. He was knocked unconscious before he could see his attacker.
he was stabbed several times. They revived him at the hospital.
Eric, what kind of physical evidence do we have to support the eyewitness testimony?
got the murder weapon.
I know the kids are sleeping. I know that! I know... Come here.
her blood and his prints.
we've also got a blood pool in the bedroom.
which is the exact location where the eyewitness, Mrs. Russo, said that she saw the murder take place from her window.
now, he must have stood over her while she bled out, because had a void on either side of her body.
the killer must have gone down the hallway at that point to the little girl's room.
his own children.
this guy is a psychopath.
we found a blood trail of partial footprints that led from Sarah's body to the master bathroom.
now, James Bradstone claimed that the intruder broke in through the bathroom window and committed the murder.
but he was lying,'cause the lab was able to show that the window was broken from the inside.
Bradstone also transferred trace amounts of the victim's blood onto the glass, which indicated that it happened after the murders.
I'm telling you, capital punishment was made for this guy.
I was working a late shift on E. R.
I came home, I fell asleep on the couch right in the living room.
I woke up... to my wife screaming.
there was a man with a black mask.
he was stabbing her.
we fought.
I managed to pull the knife out of his hand.
and then he ran.
Sarah was already gone.
no. No, Sarah.
please... Caitlin?
Caitlin, wake up, baby.
wake up, baby. Wake up, baby. Wake up.
come on.
okay. Come on. Todd?
somebody took my family. Took them!
sir, I believe that God let me live so I could help you to find him.
who do you think he was?
lieutenant, James told the police he was stealing pills from his hospital and selling them.
Yes, I read the report, gentlemen.
so apparently, you're a drug dealer.
I wanted to stop.
and some of my customers, they were resentful.
and I think one of them broke in and did this, because they knew there weren't any drugs.
I mean, I gave the whole list to your cops 15 years ago.
I'm going to need to see that list.
Mr. Newhouse, we know that the doctor was selling prescription pills.
we have you on a list of buyers.
am I the only one?
well, let's see, two on the list have died, two don't match the physical description of the attacker, and one has an alibi.
so that leaves you.
you really think I chopped up a woman and two kids over a couple of pills?
so you admit to buying the pills?
look, I-I went through this-- all of this-- with the police back then, all right?
they, they cleared me as a suspect, so...
do us a favor, tell us again.
okay.
uh, I worked the E. R. night shift with James.
I developed an affection for painkillers.
when I lost my medical license... I got the pills off James.
but I didn't break into his house, and I didn't kill anybody.
where were you at the time of the murders?
that's not in your little file there?
Mr. Newhouse... just humor us.
I was at a meeting.
what meeting?
you know, a meeting trying to deal with my addiction.
that's very convenient. Those meetings are anonymous. There's no list for us to check.
that's not my problem.
you're right, it's our problem.
wolfe: Tell you what.
you can leave, Donald, but be smart. Don't leave town.
okay.
I was standing in my living room.
through the window, I saw into the Bradstones' bedroom.
James Bradstone was stabbing his wife again and again.
here you go.
thank you.
miss... Mrs. Russo, I need to clear something up from your news interview.
were you in the kitchen or the living room when you saw the murder happen?
James Bradstone killed his wife.
I don't see what difference it makes.
it matters to a lot of people, starting with the governor, prosecutor,
Bradstone, and his only surviving son. I need to know.
now, you're sure that you were standing here, looking out this window when you saw Dr. Bradstone kill his wife?
Yes.
hold on a second. Mrs. Russo, there's an unobstructed view of the Bradstones' bedroom from the living room.
don't you think you witnessed the murder from over there?
but I... - If you were to remember you were in the living room, it would help us in holding Mr. Bradstone responsible for these horrible murders.
Yes, I suppose I could have been in my living room.
I was in my kitchen, but it doesn't change what I saw.
I trusted that young officer.
he wouldn't have let me do something wrong.
Oh, Delko... uh, we need to talk about Louise Russo's statement.
Yeah, I already know.
she told you she was in the kitchen when she saw the murders.
Yeah, that's what I want to talk to you about.
look, I have a copy of Mrs. Russo's statement right here, the same one that Talbot sent to the defense during the trial.
at first glance, it looks fine... but when I looked at the original,
I could see that "kitchen" was erased and replaced with "living room.
you took the report.
I suppose I could have been in my living room.
officer Cardoza.
let's see, um, so... you'll write down that Mrs. Russo witnessed the murder from her living room.
Yeah, but, you know, she really didn't say that.
Ah, this is your first homicide, isn't it?
Yeah. - Then, benefit from my years of experience and trust me.
I mean, you have grandparents, right?
so, she's a little confused?
but you believe she saw it happen, right?
she saw it happen, yes.
cause there's only one way that that is possible.
you don't want this guy to get away with it.
do you?
okay.
look, at the time, I was doing what I thought was right.
James Bradstone murdered his family.
now he may just walk away because the key witness was coerced.
Eric. What are you working on?
we got a problem with Mrs. Russo's statement.
the reporter got it right.
Mrs. Russo's saying that now she was in her kitchen when she saw the murders.
that's impossible, because the tree blocks her view completely from that room.
well, if we can't explain this, the governor is going to overturn the conviction.
gentlemen, need I remind you, there is another witness.
I'll take it from here.
my parents fought sometimes, but to believe my dad could...
he's written me thousands of letters saying he's innocent.
my grandparents told me not to answer.
I guess they thought it'd help me forget.
Todd, in your statement you mentioned that you heard a train.
I know that there are no tracks there.
I... I was seven.
maybe it was a truck.
all I know is, it was loud.
in the midst of all that noise, Todd, you heard your mother.
didn't you?
she was screaming.
I was in bed. I got up and went to the hall.
Todd... go on.
I have this image in my head of that day...
of someone-- I don't know who-- on top of my mother, hurting her.
but... that wasn't... that wasn't in your statement, son.
the cops said it was my dad, or I imagined it.
you got a kid talking about trains where there are no tracks.
there's not a lot of credibility there.
did you ever tell anybody else?
I tried to, but no one listened.
okay, but Todd, I'm listening.
are you telling me there's a chance that someone other than my dad did this?
you know what?
we need to find out, don't we?
so Horatio thinks that Todd Bradstone might have walked in on his mother being sexually assaulted.
well, we just pulled all the clothes from that night,'cause we're gonna through 'em and look for evidence.
there was nothing in the M. E.'s report to suggest that she was sexually assaulted.
let's, uh... let's check anyway.
sure.
I think I got something.
what is it?
well, the sample is really small, but... it could be semen.
whoa, 15 years later? Is that still viable?
normally, you know, heat and moisture and sunlight would degrade the sample, but it's been sitting in refrigerated storage.
it's a good thing we checked the clothes, huh?
that was a long time ago. We didn't have CSIs to collect all the evidence.
I'm not to blame for everything that went wrong on this case.
your words, not mine.
Bradstone is guilty. That I'm sure of.
maybe. Maybe not.
Mr. Newhouse, have a seat.
okay, I'm very busy.
you guys drag me down here twice in one day?
why don't you explain to me how your semen ended up on the clothes Sarah was wearing the night she was murdered?
excuse me?
did you kill her?
no, James Bradstone killed her. I think we all know that.
their son Todd Bradstone said that he saw a man on top of his mother the day she was murdered, hurting her.
come on, how old was he?
kids get confused.
were you having an affair?
we were having fun.
she was hot.
her husband was ignoring her.
yeah... I was there that night.
honey, I'm home.
he's home early.
Yeah, from who knows where.
he needs to know, Donald, today.
are you crazy? No, not like this.
you get downstairs and you stall him.
what are you going to do, climb out the bathroom window?
uh, yeah. Go on, get down there, go!
I heard screaming coming from downstairs, and I went out through the bathroom window.
it was stuck. I had to kick it out.
you were there when it happened.
Yeah, but that's all I know. I got right out of there.
why didn't you come forward?
you already had a witness.
besides, I didn't really see anything.
I think there's more to it than that.
I'm going to have you go with Officer Johnson.
Ryan, hey.
I need you to go to the crime scene.
Hey, did she get her hearing checked out yet?
I told her she's a liability until she... - I can hear you both clear as a bell.
you heard that? - Well, yeah. I went to the doctor.
I, uh, got this little hearing aid.
check it out.
she's like the Bionic Woman now.
exactly. I was cleared for work, so watch what you say.
this place is exactly how it was at the time of the murders.
well, Todd Bradstone owns it, used to live in it.
I'm not sure why he hangs on to the place.
who'd buy it?
it's eerie.
Donald Newhouse says he broke the bathroom window.
Calleigh wants us to luminol it for the presence of blood.
all right.
there was definitely blood here.
Yeah, it says that there were tiny droplets of the victim's blood on the broken glass.
right.
but the prosecution believed that James Bradstone transferred that blood there when he kicked the window out, then he lied about an intruder doing it.
so, if Donald Newhouse broke the window, that means he's responsible for the presence of the victim's blood.
newhouse said that he was gone before the murders happened.
so, how'd the blood get on him, then?
that's a good question.
hold on.
I got a blood trail here.
Yeah, that's documented in this file as well-- leading right to where Sarah Bradstone was murdered.
James Bradstone wasn't standing over Sarah as she died.
no.
Donald Newhouse was.
I should have told you before, Donald.
I don't like liars.
what are you talking about?
you killed her. You killed Sarah.
blood proves it.
you left a blood trail from Sarah Bradstone's body to the bathroom window that you kicked out.
her blood, your footprints.
she wasn't downstairs arguing with her husband.
she was bleeding out at your feet.
I'm sorry.
are you admitting to killing Sarah?
Sarah and I-- we were... we were together that night.
I... And as I was... sneaking out, I,uh, realized that I...
I left my wallet in the bedroom, and...
before I could get back in, the yelling from downstairs, it came up into the bedroom.
and then, I heard the door slam, and then... ...it was quiet again.
Oh, God.
help me.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
so, you let her die, but you grabbed your wallet.
well, I wasn't going to leave it there.
cause that would have made you a suspect.
listen, you were in the house.
you have opportunity. You were having an affair.
that's motive. I have to be honest with you.
I think you look good for this.
we're going to hold you.
I'm going to have Eric show Donald's picture to Mrs. Russo.
maybe she can I. D. him as the killer.
Mrs. Russo.
you guys again.
I'm on my walk.
Yeah, this will just take a second, okay?
um, could you, uh... could you tell us if that might have been the man you saw attacking Sarah Bradstone?
hold on a sec. I need my readers.
now, maybe from a distance, I could have confused them.
is that what you think might have happened?
Nope. Not him.
you sure?
I told you 15 years ago, young man, and I'm telling you again.
I saw James Bradstone kill his wife.
how many more times do I have to tell you?
thank you, Mrs. Russo.
we'll need you to testify at a hearing later today, okay?
of course you do.
our office will call you to set it up.
that's good!
she's telling the truth.
Yeah, well, we're running out of time to prove it.
got her? - Yeah. All right.
Mrs. Russo. - This is Delko.
I need a BOLO out on a black Prius.
Mrs. Russo? Mrs. Russo? - No plates.
suspect vehicle was involved in a hit-and-run.
it's heading south on Pine.
okay.
Mrs. Russo? Mrs. Russo?
come on, breathe. Mrs. Russo?
I've got the suspect vehicle-- black Prius, no plates-- in sight.
pine and Sonora.
out of the car, driver, right now!
let me see your hands!
what's your problem? - It was an accident.
it was a hit-and-run, genius.
I got scared.
I have two DUIs on my record, so I took off.
no, you didn't. You didn't even apply the brakes. I saw you!
you just ran her down.
look, it happened too fast.
one minute, the street's clear. The next minute, she's on the hood of my car.
this was no accident.
you got a map in here with the victim's name and address on it.
what the hell do you have...?
what? What do you got?
gold bar?
who hired you to kill Louise Russo?
um, I want to see a lawyer.
Yeah.
you're going to see your lawyer at the police station.
let's go.
cuff him.
Walter's still tracking down the gold bars.
Frank, does Phillip Hale have a record?
no, he's clean, but I pulled up his Social Security number to find out where he works.
and what'd you get?
well, when he's not running over old ladies, he's a...
isn't the Forty Palms near the hospital James Bradstone used to work at?
Yeah.
maybe that's where they crossed paths.
they sent me a members list that goes back 15 years.
is Bradstone a member?
he's not. However... look who is.
thank you.
Where'd you get the gold bars from, Donald?
what gold bars?
gold bars you used to pay off Phillip Hale.
who?
Donald, you hired Phillip Hale to kill Louise Russo.
this is... this is crazy.
Phillip was a caddie at Forty Palms. You are a member there.
my Forty Palms membership, it lapsed like a decade ago.
and I don't know any Phillip Hale!
you know what I think?
I think you knew that we were gonna show Mrs. Russo your photograph and she was gonna I. D. you as the killer.
which was really stupid, Donald,'cause she never even pointed the finger at you.
I wouldn't kill anyone.
not this Louise woman.
and especially not Sarah.
you don't understand.
understand what?
I loved Sarah.
and she loved me.
you told me earlier that you were just having a good time.
it was more than that.
we were making plans to... ...to be together, and I think that...
James found out, and that's why he killed her.
so, you loved her, but you didn't help her?
I know. I'm a coward.
you think I don't know that?
I would never hurt her.
I'm sorry, but your word just doesn't mean very much right now.
so, did we track down the serial numbers on the gold bars, Walter?
Yes, sir, we did.
they were stolen from a bank's safety deposit box up in Orlando.
a man named Robert Sage was convicted of the heist 15 years ago, but they never recovered all the gold.
is Sage still in prison?
no. He was released two weeks ago.
he must have gotten out and dug up his stash.
okay, let's get after him, then.
Yeah, there's an APB out on him, but no luck so far.
Walter, let me ask you a question.
why would Sage give Hale his gold?
you know, I thought the same thing, so I made a couple calls, and get this
sage was tried in federal court here in Miami.
while awaiting trial, he was housed in the same cell block as James Bradstone.
they've exchanged letters ever since.
well, that's the answer, isn't it?
I don't know him.
but you do know Robert Sage, James.
you two were in the same cell block together.
Yeah, well, faces and names tend to blur in here.
sage hired Hale to kill Louise Russo.
Louise is dead?
you recommended that somebody be recruited from Forty Palms, which gave us Newhouse, your former drug client.
so tell me... did Phillip Hale tell you about this deal I made with him?
or did Robert Sage?
Yeah. I didn't think so.
you can't prove any of this.
James, did you know your wife was having an affair?
an affair?
wait. When?
a witness came forward to tell me that he was with her the night of the murders.
well, who? Who?!
maybe I can identify him.
come on, he's got to be the killer. Who was it?
you already know who he is.
you knew about the affair, and you killed her for it.
you're trying to rattle me?
it ain't gonna work.
I am so close.
you think so?
so, you found my wife's boyfriend.
he's got to be a suspect.
and you lost your eyewitness.
you're making this case better for me than any defense attorney could.
matter of fact, you're making it real hard for the governor not to just let me out of here.
Thanks.
James... I'm not finished yet.
what was the strength of this case in the first place?
Mrs. Russo's testimony.
we know that she couldn't have seen the murder from her kitchen.
but we now know there was a second witness. Bradstone's son was there, right?
Yeah, he didn't see anything.
no, but what did he say in his testimony?
he said that he heard the train, and then he heard the screams.
right. Those are the frightened ramblings of a seven-year-old boy.
we know there are no tracks near there, so, what else sounds like a train?
what about the weather?
let's check the weather.
all right.
well, that night, Hurricane Erin was 100 miles off the coast.
what was the wind speed?
it was only a category one, but there were winds of 50 miles per hour reported here in Miami.
50 miles an hour?
you're thinking that the train sound that Todd heard was actually wind?
you know what? I've got an idea.
DELKO: All right, let's get those fans over here.
all right, I'm in the kitchen.
I'm in position, as well.
all right, the wind would have been coming off of the water, so I had them pointing the wind machines this way, all right?
okay, when you're ready, Eric, crank it up.
Yeah. Set it to 50 miles an hour, all right?
you see anything?
just the trees. Still no clean line of sight.
she couldn't have seen the murder from here.
H, I don't think this is working.
okay, hang on a second, Jesse.
we're getting an effect here-- a wind tunnel effect.
Yeah, you mean the way the wind picks up speed between skyscrapers.
that's exactly right.
it creates a funnel in which the pressure goes up, and if the pressure goes up, the speed increases.
well, how much more? The wind needs to be the same speed as it was 15 years ago.
well, that's 75 miles per hour.
crank it up, Eric.
Hey, crank it up to 75 miles per hour.
are we good, Jesse?
Yeah, we're good.
she was telling the truth.
a wind tunnel?
it blew the trees 45 degrees to the left.
creating a clear line of sight from the kitchen to the murder scene.
she saw what she said she saw
James Bradstone killing his wife and daughter.
so, can you validate these wind patterns?
we got documentation from the Atlantic Weather Service.
it sinks Bradstone.
so, the governor will accept the inconsistencies in Mrs. Russo's statements as harmless error.
all right, we're good.
I should have never allowed you to get that woman to change her testimony.
Jesse... - You risked my career and your career.
I mean, do you understand, we almost let a killer walk?
you done?
I need to take these to the governor.
so, it's true?
my father really did it?
it's true, son.
seems like I've wasted a lot of time waiting for an answer I already knew.
so, can I stop being afraid of him now?
you can, Todd. He's not gonna hurt you anymore.
what a dad, huh?
do you have a family?
I have a son, Todd.
he's about your age.
he got dealt a bad hand, too.
but you know what?
he rallied.
just the way I think you can, Todd.
you know what I'm going to do tomorrow, Lieutenant?
what's that?
put this place on the market.
good for you.
you going to the gym?
Yeah.
about last night...
I know that we keep saying that it's not gonna happen anymore.
yeah?
but it keeps happening.
that a bad thing?
I don't know that we should talk about it here.
so what, your place or mine?
can you forgive me, son?
it's time.
you deserve this.
dad.
how's it going over there, son?
well, you know, some days are hard.
you know, the firefights, uh-- it's not like the movies.
this is real.
um, yesterday, uh, we helped this... we helped these kids rebuild a school that was destroyed during the fighting.
dad, you've never seen so many kids so excited to go back to school.
you know, it was cool.
sounds like it.
so, I... I guess yesterday was a good day.
I think maybe I'm doing something important over here.
Hey, Dad, uh, what's the matter?
you look kind of sad.
no, son. No.
it's just... It's just good to see you.
you, too, Dad. You, too.
Harmon, let's go. We're moving out.
Oh, I got to go, Dad. They're calling me.
you take care of yourself.
I will.
ladies, refreshers, please.
Thanks.
here's what you need, some more rocket fuel.
Hey, it's not fair.
you guys are not wearing your masks.
how do you know I'm not?
Oh, come on. Get out of here. Be naughty. Mingle.
okay.
where are you gonna be?
Mmm, I'll find you, sweetheart.
I will always find you.
Oh, come on.
come on. Let's go.
Oh, God!
my head won't stop spinning.
I'm gonna get you some water.
come sit down.
that one needs a spanking.
please, Coop, take it easy, okay?
I'm not feeling well.
what are you doing?
Anna, honey, it's, it's, it's, it's gonna be okay, all right?
it's, it's really... it's gonna be fine.
I'm gonna take care of everything and everything... It'll be fine, I-I swear to God.
I know who you are...
and I know what you did in L. A.
you are referring to... baseless allegations.
I was acquitted of my wife's murder, and I had nothing to do with this.
I noticed the ink on your hand.
very good, sir, very good. And?
clearly, the victim was killed with a pen.
Oh, please, I sign a lot of contracts and checks all day long.
I run a major business from my home... - You're a pornographer, Mr. Enright.
it's adult entertainment.
it's a multibillion-dollar business.
a very legitimate movie business.
well, then, roll credits, Mr. Enright.
I'm sorry.
that's a wrap.
masks, hot air balloons, handcuffs... What kind of party was this?
well, the owner of the house is that guy Tony Enright.
he's the porn king.
all right, I'm gonna go back with the body, see if I can get something off the murder weapon.
all right.
Calleigh, hold up. Check this out.
what does that look like to you?
some sort of a listening device.
Oh, my God... somebody was listening in on the murder.
that's sick!
Leslie starred in Tony's films.
she was my best friend.
I'm really sorry.
you know, Anna, I,uh, I actually saw you one time before, when you came down to the precinct to give some evidence.
you're Jesse Cardoza's friend, right?
Jesse Cardoza's no friend of mine.
that guy stalked me all the way from L. A.
now why would he do that?
cause of Tony.
so ink is ink.
I guess you're gonna prove I got a lot of pens in my house. That's good work.
look who it is-- the guy that kills every girl he gets close to.
Hey, easy, Cardoza, or I'll sue your ass for slander.
I will take you through the courts until your hair goes gray. - Go ahead, sue me.
I will sue you! - Mr. Enright!
another word from you, I'll take you into custody myself.
you better back it off, T.E. Don't do anything stupid.
and you are?
I guess you don't recognize me.
coop, please.
I used to play for the Dolphins.
coop Daly's my name.
I work for Mr. Enright now.
Yeah, it's okay, Cooper. All right? I'm making conversation, that's all, all right?
now, Lieutenant...
you ask Johnny Hollywood here what happened out in Los Angeles, okay?
are you talking about - Jesse?
when you killed your wife in cold blood and got away with it? Is that what you're saying?
Yeah, I'm talking about the time you tried to frame me.
frame you? - Excuse me. Excuse me!
what are you talking about, you scumbag?!
look, he can't control himself. He's a dirty cop! - Mr. Enright!
shut up.
don't let him get away with this.
he's not gonna get away with anything, but this is not the way.
adios!
Mr. Enright... just remember what I said.
how could I forget?
Anna, is there anything at all that you can remember from last night?
no, um, it was just a party.
we were all having a great time.
um, Tony gave me a glass of wine.
and, um, then it's just a blur.
we ran a presumptive on Anna's wine glass.
it turned up roofies.
you were drugged, Anna.
get him away from me.
get him away from me!
just trying to help, that's all.
then tell your boss to leave Tony alone.
okay, okay, we're good here.
I've got it.
Anna, I think we should get you to the hospital, okay? For some tests.
Why?
because you were drugged, and anything could have happened after that.
the strange thing is, Leslie wasn't roofied.
Really?
I found stomach acid in her mouth and upper esophageal tract.
well, here's my guess... she stumbled onto a sexual assault.
wrong place, wrong time.
cost her her life.
what about the murder weapon?
fountain pen.
carbonate tube, sterling silver edge.
the killer probably grabbed it right off the desk.
Yep. All right, weapon of opportunity.
that means he wouldn't have gloved up first.
we all know what that means.
it means there were prints.
your fingerprints were found on the murder weapon used to kill Leslie Stoltz, Coop.
so, this is all about fingerprints on a pen.
are you serious?
Yes, dead serious.
you sure know how to be a killjoy, don't ya?
well, you would know.
you did it.
I didn't kill anybody, little man.
then why are your prints on that pen?
well, I guess you don't recognize me.
I used to play for the Dolphins when they were the Dolphins.
I sign a lot of autographs.
I probably signed two dozen that night.
I bet I must've used every pen in that whole house.
that's... your story? You're gonna stick with that?
not only am I gonna stick with it... but it's the truth, pint-size.
I'm five nine.
my pants are five nine.
I know how these things work, and, uh... we're pretty much done, right?
we're done for now. Don't go far, Mr. Daly; you'll be back.
I guarantee it.
you're looking at a Soviet-made laser microwave beam dispersal unit.
great.
now this time in English?
it's a transmitter for a wireless microphone.
it's a very tricked-out bug.
so I was right.
someone had ears on that murder.
is there any way of finding out where the signal is transmitting?
well, high-tech as it may be, it should be able to be tracked like a normal cell transmission.
triangulating the satellites.
telescoping down.
got a hit right there.
okay, am I going crazy?
the receiver's in our parking garage?
no, you're not crazy.
I'm gonna go check that out.
you want backup?
no. I got it.
what are you doing, Calleigh?
open the trunk, Jesse.
back away from the car.
do it. - Come on.
is that a recording of the murder?
I assume it's on there.
I was just about to link in.
when did you put the bug at Enright's house?
eight days ago.
breaking and entering-- I tell you what, man, you are way off the reservation.
no, I didn't break in.
Enright was hosting a party; I walked in.
what are you doing?
this guy's a murderer.
a murderer! Do you understand that?
well, I think about my wife Tracy every day, and then I see his face.
I wanted something to put him away.
all right.
I'll tell you what, if you're right, I'll help you.
but you better be right.
Oh, my God.
what are you doing to her?
you shouldn't be here. - You're sick!
I'm calling the police!
Oh, my God.
what are you doing to her?
you shouldn't be here. - You're sick!
I'm calling the police!
woman's voice belongs to our murder victim, Leslie Stoltz, and we think the male voice belongs to Coop Daly, Enright's security.
I'm still working a timbre comparison, but I'm fairly certain it's a lock.
well, it's compelling evidence. Puts Daly in the room.
unfortunately, you can't use it in a court of law.
can we float it to potential jurors?
the takeaway will be, Cardoza's still a dirty cop.
wait a minute, what?
murder case in L. A., evidence didn't fit his theory, he made it disappear.
Rebecca, accusations were made-- nothing was ever proven.
okay, but the cloud around it drove him here to Miami, and so here we are again with Cardoza's dirty evidence.
my advice, Horatio: fire him.
out of the question.
suit yourself.
but not only will I reject this evidence,
I will reject all evidence that Cardoza has anything to do with.
he is compromising your lab.
well, then I have no choice but to clear his name.
thank you, Walter.
sure thing, H.
Yes, Ms. Nevins?
why go to all this trouble for just one CSI?
because he is a member of my team.
Oh, cop loyalty. Right.
okay, you get me new information on Cardoza, I'll reconsider
but one of my people goes with you.
based on my approval.
Eric. - H, hey.
so the S. A. put me on the schedule to work the Leslie Stoltz murder.
fine.
first assignment: shadow Lieutenant Caine.
thank you, Ms. Nevins.
what's going on?
we're going to L. A.
l. A.huh?
lieutenant Caine, welcome to L. A.
captain Sutter, Eric Delko.
so what brings you gentlemen to my town, besides the weather, the women and the Lakers?
how is Cardoza?
we're here about the Enright case, Captain.
Bel Air mansion.
Tony Enright sliced up his wife.
Cardoza was the primary.
and he had him nailed, till trial.
how do you go from top cop to zero?
that's all on the record.
I need to see that file, Captain.
gentlemen, that ship sailed.
double jeopardy's a bitch.
not for Cardoza.
well, that doesn't sound like my business.
it is now.
all right, gentlemen, follow me.
all this evidence says one thing: Enright murdered his wife brutally.
the guy's a known wife abuser.
Jesse found blood from the dead wife on Enright's clothes and in his car.
and then he walks.
Yeah.
right in front of all the cameras.
real black mark for the department.
you know what?
here.
here's the thing that brought Jesse down.
homicide found a key piece of evidence at the murder scene.
a cuff link was thought to belong to another suspect, not Enright.
Cardoza photographed it... but it never showed up in the evidence locker.
why not?
paper says it went missing.
initials "A. T."
jury TV had gavel-to-gavel coverage of the whole trial.
Yeah.
this is from the day Enright's lawyer grilled Jesse.
Ah, Detective Cardoza...
now, you took the photograph of this bloody cuff link at the murder scene, correct?
Yes, I did.
and would you please read out for the court, uh, the initials that are engraved on that cuff link?
well, those don't appear to be the initials of my client, Tony Enright, now, do they?
was that a yes or a no?
no. - No. Thank you.
um, there-there appears to be blood on this cuff link.
now, will you tell us, please, is that the victim's blood or the perpetrator?
I don't know.
I'm so sorry. I'm... going a little deaf in this ear.
could you, uh, repeat that a bit louder?
I don't know.
you don't know?
he doesn't know.
well! But surely, this is very important evidence.
I mean, Mrs. Enright could have ripped it from the sleeve of her perpetrator, right?
all right, tell me, where is it?
where is this bloody cuff link that you photographed so ably at the crime scene?
we've been unable to locate it.
it disappeared... just poof, hmm?
I mean, evidence that could prove that someone other than my client murdered Victoria Enright.
Yes.
so you wouldn't mind if they searched your house for that cuff link, would you?
you're not gonna find it there.
Why?
did you hide it somewhere else?
that's not what I meant.
no. What you meant was to be judge and jury, hiding evidence that would vindicate my client.
and you know what?
you very nearly succeeded.
thank you.
so... who owns the cuff link... and where did it go, Eric?
we figure that out, we clear Jesse, right?
or we sink him.
okay.
our forensic nurse found evidence of forcible sexual intercourse.
but there was no evidence of male contribution.
what does that mean?
it means that your attacker wore a condom.
none of this makes sense.
I know.
this may be a little strange question to ask, but, um...
do you think that Tony could've had anything to do with it?
how can you even ask me that?
look, Tony gets accused of things, but... people don't know him like I do.
I'm just asking because I was married to someone like him once.
and, um, I know what that can do to your self-image.
it's not like that with Tony and me.
and I used to defend him, as well.
and I paid a pretty heavy price.
if, um... I mean, if you ever feel like you want to talk to someone, here's my card.
okay, guys. We're now in a Cisco WebEx Meeting.
are we ready?
Dave, is this line secure?
absolutely secure, H.
the system guarantees it.
Horatio, I'm sure I don't have to tell you, but I never touched that cuff link.
I saw it and I popped off two-by-fives.
okay, I understand that, Jesse.
now, can we run the cuff link through the database, gentlemen?
our cuff link has a unique appearance, so we should be able to run it through image recognition software.
CARDOZA: I did a similar search two and a half years ago, nothing came up.
no, no, no.
this is different, this is new.
it's like facial recognition software.
compares shapes and features, then searches for any comparable image anywhere on the Web.
okay, did we get a match?
we have a match.
Westside Platinum Jewelers.
I heard of that place.
BENTON: They must have taken their store online.
okay, Eric and I are gonna check into that.
thank you, gentlemen.
what can I do?
Jesse, just lay low.
H. Westside Platinum.
I got a batch of orders for the cuff links.
all right, I'm gonna print out the company list, we'll go name by name.
wait a second.
right there. Darren Vogel.
that's Enright's attorney.
Yeah, Vogel bought a pair of the cuff links a week before the murder.
think that's a coincidence?
not a chance, Eric.
Oh... Looks like we've got some babysitters.
have a nice day, gentlemen.
well, what are you doing?
what... What are you wearing?
get off the phone, please. - Bunny? Yeah.
no, I'll buy it for you, I'll buy it. - Excuse me.
uh, I think we've got a prospective client here.
Yes, I-I've got to go. All right. Yeah, all right.
I'll see you at 7: 00. Yeah, love you.
now, you boys know that my billing rate is $2, 000 an hour.
but here's the good news: I take euros.
we are not soliciting counsel.
we're here about the Tony Enright case.
Enright? Come on. That's old history, isn't it?
he was acquitted.
until now.
I'm in the acquittal business.
look, it's my life's mission to keep the wrongly accused from being incarcerated.
Yeah, like, uh, like that little girl last year, right?
was accused of killing her brother.
Yes! Thank you for bringing that up.
one of my great trials.
evidence against Hannah was, uh, was overwhelming.
Yes. Until they found a pair of girl's glasses at the crime scene that didn't match.
now, obviously, that was left by the real killer.
and the jury agreed with me.
Yes. How convenient.
Ah, well, you know, I'm good at finding holes in the prosecution's case.
I mean, that is my gift. - Your gift is planting evidence.
careful.
that's libelous.
about the Enright case.
fact remains that those cuff links left a reasonable doubt, and you were the one that purchased them. We have proof right there.
Oh, I see. This is proof, is it?
well, this is fake.
Oh, yeah, that's my credit card number there.
vexing, isn't it?
the cuff link that I bought-- very similar in design and style-- winds up at a crime scene.
let's cut the BS.
you planted it there to help your client beat a murder rap.
is that your theory?
that's not fact. There's no foundation there.
plant anything else, and I will personally drive you to Chino.
Yes, I believe you would.
as a matter of fact, I've been contemplating retiring, anyway.
that's your problem.
you know, you can buy a sense of humor.
we got to catch this guy, Calleigh.
we got to catch him. I just-- I know he did it.
I think I may have found a way.
Really?
well, I started thinking about it, and the print alone is not gonna sink Coop Daly.
no, he's got, uh, that other explanation--the, um, autograph defense.
exactly.
so if the print won't do it, maybe what's inside the print will.
now you lost me.
I'm gonna break down the chemical compound in Coop's fingerprint.
within that, I think there may be something he can't refute.
dimethicone silicone - based lubricant, and cells consistent with lambskin.
lambskin?
that's a condom.
exactly.
coop was wearing a condom.
so was Anna's rapist.
this spectrum has a unique chemical signature.
I'm gonna run it against the spectra from Anna's sex kit.
so, um, what kind of condom do I use?
what's my favorite? My brand of choice?
I rarely use them.
so it's kind of a, um, personal question.
actually, it's evidence.
Really?
there were specific traces in Anna Kitson that we also found in the oil of your fingerprint.
that print is the same as the one on the murder weapon.
so, just to get this straight, you raped Anna, you killed Leslie Stoltz, and we can tie you to both.
you guys are pretty funny.
I mean, you just crack me up.
you really think you're gonna pin a murder rap on me based on a lambskin condom?
I don't think anybody here mentioned a lambskin condom, genius.
that's knowledge only the killer would have.
you know, Mr. Enright told me that she'd be a willing participant.
he told me that he was sick of the bitch.
he gave her to me, as a bonus, because we had a good year.
you know, if she would've just relaxed and just stayed with the program, everything would've been just fine.
so that's when Leslie tried to stop you.
she came barging in.
and everything kind of went, uh... everything kind of went haywire.
Oh, my God.
what are you doing to her?
you shouldn't be here.
so you roofied Anna because she wouldn't cooperate.
I didn't roofie anybody, pint-size.
that was Tony.
do you want her? You can have her.
Ah, you're kidding, right?
no, I'm not kidding, Coop. It's been a really, really good year, okay?
now you, my friend, deserve a little bonus.
ladies, refreshers.
you're under arrest, Mr. Daly.
get this animal out of here.
see you later, baby.
well, it's about time.
do you mind telling me why I have been here for over an hour, drinking this swil with no access to a telephone?
well, I'll tell you what. You can borrow mine, Mr. Enright.
use it to call your lawyer.
let him know we're booking you for pandering and possession of a controlled substance.
and we've got a good shot at tying you in to Leslie Stoltz's murder.
Oh, please.
you people just don't get it, do you?
you know, your good friend Coop Daly-- he sold you out.
the actions you took led to Leslie Stoltz's death.
that's felony murder.
well, I could just say one little magic word.
what's that?
the judge is going to toss this case out right away, and you know it.
you see, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Enright.
so, what are you saying?
you are going to do a better job than the world-famous LAPD?
if any of these crime scene photos would have shown who took that cuff link,
I think someone would have noticed by now.
somebody did notice.
Eric, take a look at this.
it's the same lady in every one of these photos.
Yes. Watch this.
bang, bang, bang. That's her again.
she's got... she's got a camera.
Eric, she can help us.
H, in a city as big as L. A., how are we going to find one girl?
this is how.
she's got a press pass.
excuse me.
captain Sutter. - Enjoying your lunch, Lieutenant?
Yes, as a matter of fact we are.
we're doing what we came to Los Angeles to do, Captain.
then you know you're wasting your time.
that's called clean police work.
are you suggesting I'm not clean?
I guess we're about to find out, Captain.
Ooh, you getting what you need? Everything, uh, everything groovy?
got the grippers in place and all that?
Yeah.
so how...?
I think it's that way. - Okay, let me take...
you don't know. - Okay, I'll take it of you. Do the move.
great.
nice, Billy, really nice.
ms. Burch. Ms. Burch.
this is a closed set.
I'm Eric Delko from Miami State Attorney's Office.
and this is Lieutenant Caine from Miami-Dade PD.
could we have a word, please?
take a break, Billy.
what can I do for you?
the Tony Enright case.
we have a photograph of you at the crime scene from a few years ago.
Oh, yeah. I was freelancing then.
thought I could sell a few shots to a news wire, maybe a tabloid.
did you?
two hours in the sun, three rolls of film-- didn't sell a thing.
do you still have the photographs?
Yeah, I have everything inside.
Stuart, can you go grab my negatives for me?
copy that.
be right back, Billy.
what are you hoping to find?
we're trying to clear a good man's name.
these are, uh, these are all from the Enright crime scene.
okay, let's scan those.
all right.
let me invert the images.
all right, there's Jesse, there's the house, the front gate, more house.
what else we got, Eric?
wait a minute.
Eric, go back.
go back. What is he doing?
evidence marker number four, Eric.
number four, that's the cuff link.
that's the missing evidence.
right. Who is this?
I don't know. It isn't Cardoza.
it's not Jesse. Who is that?
let me clean up the flare on his face.
hitting the highlights. Clean up some of this mess.
captain Sutter.
lieutenant Caine.
the Beatles played on this stage.
I know that.
I was here.
you come alone?
just like I said I would.
why here?
I like my privacy.
what's this all about, Caine?
Where'd you get this photo?
you let Jesse Cardoza take the fall for something you did.
what exactly do you want, Caine?
I want you to come clean.
all right.
we knew Enright had murdered his wife.
and we had him, too.
dead to rights.
when I saw that cuff link, I knew that his slick lawyers would get him off, so I pocketed it.
no harm, no foul. The right guy goes down.
and that's the way it should be.
but I had no idea Cardoza had already taken a photograph of it.
so you allowed it to look like he tampered with evidence.
I figured he was young.
get a couple weeks desk duty, slap on the wrist.
Yes, but it didn't turn out that way, did it?
no.
his wife was murdered-- probably by Enright.
that's something I got to live with every day.
Where's the cuff link?
I keep it right here.
always.
so I'll never forget.
slowly.
take it.
what now?
what now?
I think you know what to do.
in light of the new evidence that's been presented to us,
I would like to extend a long overdue apology to Jesse Cardoza, on behalf of the city, this department and the District Attorney's Office.
Mr. Cardoza, who is no longer a member of the LAPD, is a shining example of what this department and all its officers should strive for every day.
Hey, sweetheart, sweetheart, hey, don't worry.
I'm gonna be out of here by dinner. It's all gonna be fine.
we can go to our special little place that we love to go to together.
you remember that place?
remember that place? Do you remember that place, huh?! - Just go to hell!
you little bitch!
you're making a really bad mistake, sweetheart.
really, really bad mistake!
my lawyer just flew in. Vogel will get me off.
Oh, and there's super cop.
God, you're so good, huh?
you're really good.
come around and watch a movie sometime.
I'm unable to comment on that at this time.
suffice it to say that Mr. Cardoza's name and reputation has been cleared.
well, that door's not going to open itself.
thank you.
lieutenant.
you know, uh, Tony Enright is never going to see the inside of a prison cell.
don't be too sure, Mr. Vogel.
actually, I'm dead sure.
I want you out of Miami.
have you come to wish me ?
by the way, if you're ever in the Emirates, don't bother to call.
don't worry, I'll get the door.
thank you.
you would have done the same for me, Jesse.
thank you.
subtle.
Yeah, well, 12-month tour in Basra will do that to you, I guess.
you know, I think she likes me.
I think it's the uniform.
Yeah, more like the man wearing it.
it's good to see you.
good to see you, too, Dad.
look...
there, uh, there's something I've been meaning to tell you, Dad.
it has to do with the meeting down at Southern Command earlier.
me and some, uh, some infantry buddies, we transferred over to 19th Mountain Division.
we're slated to deploy from Fort Gordon in 14 days.
deploy to where?
eastern Afghanistan.
you've... you've made this decision without me.
dad, it's an important job.
it's a dangerous job.
Yeah, just like yours.
you better get that.
what's up, Mace?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just having breakfast with my dad right now. What's up?
no, I haven't talked to him.
but, yeah, he said he wanted to go.
Yeah, yeah, I'll swing by right now.
all right.
all right, bye.
everything okay?
Yeah, some of my buddies were headed over to the marina earlier.
nobody can get a hold of my friend Brian.
it's really weird.
this is usually not like him.
you need a lift?
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Thanks, Dad.
this is where he lives?
might as well.
he inherited this lot from his dad.
spends most of his free time working on cars.
okay.
will you wait for me?
Yeah, go ahead. Okay.
Brian, where the hell you at, man?
it's Harmon!
Brian! Dad!
dad! Dad! It's... What's going on, son?
dad, it's Brian!
Kyle, call 911!
call 911 right now!
Yeah, we need the fire department.
193 Avalon Drive, right now!
Hurry!
Kyle, get that hose!
don't die on me, Brian!
he's gone.
he's gone.
be careful with this, gentlemen.
his limbs may fall right off when you lift him up into the bag.
it certainly looks like an execution, doesn't it, Doctor?
it does. The tire's melted around the victim's chest and arms.
haven't seen this since the gang wars in the late 90s.
his body is encased in rubber.
I'll save as much as I can for you.
thank you, Doctor. BOA VISTA: Hey, H?
What'd you get?
got an antique flashlight.
looks like military-issue, and I've got a gas can over there.
it may have fingerprints on it.
how's Kyle doing?
he is struggling.
thank you for asking.
so, you said his name is Brian Nassir?
Yeah.
we were like brothers.
we did everything together.
we got each other's back.
I mean, what the hell?
the guy was in his own garage!
just - Just calm down, Kyle, all right?
is that Brian's car?
no, sir. I've never seen it before.
okay, thanks, Kyle.
that was him back there, Dad, huh?
that was Brian.
Kyle, it's too soon to tell. Let the M.E. do his work.
dad, of course it was him!
I mean, it was his property!
he hasn't been answering his phone calls all morning!
I understand. Take a look at that and tell me if that could have been Brian's.
what is that?
it's from the Vietnam war.
was he a collector?
just cars. Not that stuff.
okay.
but I know who was.
Kyle, wait a minute.
Hey, you couldn't just leave it alone,
you ignorant bastard?!
Frank? TRIPP: Get back.
Kyle! Kyle! Dad, this guy's stupid! Dad, this jackass lives next door, okay?! Shh! Go home! Go home!
he's been in our face ever since we got back;
telling Brian to watch his back 'cause he's Muslim!
take him home. Please.
what the hell was that all about?
I, uh... I apologize.
I understand that you have a problem with the neighbor, Brian Nassir.
and I won't apologize for that.
this is my country, sir. It's my community.
it isn't a safe harbor for Islamic extremists like him.
so I take it you went over there and did something about it.
I worked recon in Vietnam.
I don't need to set foot on his property to keep a watchful eye on him.
I found this on the property.
it's gonna have your fingerprints on it, isn't it?
there's always stuff going on over there late at night.
these guys are on some sort of three-week leave.
they're up to something.
now that's how every terrorist plot starts, you know?
homeland Security can't keep track of all of it.
it's up to us to be vigilant.
what's your name?
okay, Glen, you are quickly talking your way into a murder conviction.
Hey, there were others, too.
some of those Middle Eastern-lookin' types showing up to visit. Talk to them.
maybe there was some infighting.
Oh, we will.
but you're a piece of work.
we're definitely gonna hang onto you.
Glen, don't leave town.
we went to boot camp together, all right? We were placed in the same unit.
Brian wasn't an extremist!
Kyle, listen to me.
we have to remain objective about Brian.
look, Dad, that old man next door is a wack job, okay?!
he's mistaking racism for patriotism! Gosh!
I need you to keep your voice down.
I cannot charge the man without more.
so be patient.
Yes, Dr. Loman.
Horatio, I think you're gonna want to come down here.
okay. What is it?
our victim isn't who we think he is.
I'll be right there.
so, this isn't Brian Nassir?
correct. Burned so badly, I had to pull his dental records to make a positive I.D.
Brian Nassir had a dental bridge on the first and second lower left molars.
this man does not.
are you sure?
I mean, are you positive that it's not him?
as sure as I am that the vagus and thoracic spinal accessory nerves impart parasympathetic control of the myocardium.
they do, and I am.
so who is the victim, then?
we ran the registration on our mystery
range Rover outside Brian's garage.
it belongs to a Rahim Farooq.
and with little else to go on,
I requested dental records for that very name.
turns out those did match.
allow me to introduce Rahim Farooq.
does this ring a bell for you?
no.
okay. Frank, we know what he drives.
what else do we know about him?
address is in Coconut Grove.
okay. Send somebody out there, please.
Jesse and Calleigh are on the way.
okay, thank you, Frank.
thank you, Doctor.
Brian's alive.
Yes, but now he's a suspect.
he always found it difficult here in the United States.
frustrations with life here, making money, raising a family.
I'm so sorry.
I know this is extremely difficult.
Mrs. Farooq, do you recognize this man?
no, I don't.
who is he?
we found your husband's body on his property.
do you have any idea why he might have been there?
you have to understand, we left Iran not long after the revolution.
rahim wanted to pursue a business opportunity here in the United States.
even when things got bad recently, it was never my place to ask the specifics of what he was doing.
is this your daughter?
Yes.
that's Maya, our daughter.
how am I going to tell her?
Salumeh, there's one more thing we're going to need from you.
Mrs. Farooq, we're gonna scan your fingerprints into our system, okay?
it's standard procedure.
we do it to eliminate you as a suspect.
just put your right hand on the tablet.
palm down.
there you go.
there. Thanks.
your husband was set on fire, ma'am, and we found an empty gas can by his body.
your print that we just scanned, it's on the gas can.
was it a red gas can?
Yes, it was.
maybe it was the can that Rahim kept in the car.
I would beg him just to leave it in the garage, but he insisted.
sitting in the driver's seat, it would start to smell.
it would always find its way back into the trunk, though.
and you've never been on this man's property?
no.
I have not.
doctor...
that's paper.
charred as bad as the body.
Yeah.
let me get that to Questioned Documents.
Brian! Dude, where the hell have you been, bro?!
I thought you were dead.
I almost was.
so, you're gonna tell me what the hell happened?
not over the phone.
okay, so where are you?
who's asking?
I am.
okay, I'm gonna tell you, but you can't tell anyone else.
that includes your dad.
Kyle, you have to promise me.
all right, I promise.
good to see you, man. Nice to see you, man.
I didn't know if we'd make it.
this is the girl I was always telling you about-- Maya.
Brian said we can trust you.
I wouldn't have called anyone else.
what the hell, man? My dad, okay, he can help you.
what's wrong with you, Harmon? I told you not to tell anyone.
I've seen that girl before.
the picture at the victim's house.
that's Rahim Farooq's daughter.
his daughter?
we trusted you.
you two are coming with us.
you're under arrest for murder.
murder?
are you serious?
we found a dead body on your property.
what? No.
miss Farooq, that's your father.
my fa...?
let's go.
I'm sorry, dude.
you did the right thing, son.
then how come it doesn't feel like that?
okay, stay standing on the butcher paper.
put your hands up, please.
okay, this hand.
Maya, I need you to hand me the contents of your purse, please.
I've got a wallet.
lip gloss.
cell phone.
this is a bus ticket to Saint Petersburg.
did your mother know you were going out of town?
Mr. Wolfe, how we doing?
all the normal stuff here, H.
okay. Let's keep digging, please.
what's that thing for?
this is a Xenos portable gas chromatographer.
it reads any chemical signature of any compound you may have touched today.
Yes, and we have a winner-- benzene, xylene and ethanol.
Yeah, so?
that is called "gasoline"
sir, what does that mean?
it means we know why you went to the bus station.
all right, Maya,
I need you to hold your arms out.
you have gasoline on your arms and your hands.
the gasoline was meant for me.
my father, he had a... a violent temper.
but I'd never seen him that angry in my whole life.
Maya, are you telling me your father was trying to kill you?
Yes.
Why?
because I was promised to another man.
so, you were part of an arranged marriage?
my father had worked to arrange it all, but then I met Brian.
I just... I just fell for him.
so, I went back to my mom to see if we could just call the whole thing off.
it's not cold feet, Mom.
but you agreed to marry Ahmad.
I thought I could.
and... then I met Brian.
and when he was away...
he was all I could think about.
and the more time I spend with him, the more I realize he's the one.
think about what you're saying, Maya.
dad will understand.
your father is a proud man.
he won't be agreeable to this, Maya.
you know that.
you share the same faith, don't you?
it didn't matter to him. I wasn't the one chosen for her.
she belonged to a guy named Ahmad.
I didn't even think her dad knew about me, until he showed up this morning.
Maya! What the hell?
dad, what are you...? How could you bring this shame upon me, huh?!
Oh, my God!
Hey! Let go of her! Let go of her!
she was promised! You were promised!
dad! Oh, my God!
are you okay, Dad?
Yeah, he's gonna have one hell of a headache, though.
we need to get as far from here as possible, Maya. What...
let's go! Let's go right now! Let's go! Wait! Wait!
I couldn't go home to my mom.
she was probably the one who told him where we were in the first place.
we didn't know what else to do.
look, we were taking the bus to find a motel somewhere to figure things out.
well, somebody figured things out.
Mr. Farooq was found wrapped in a tire and set ablaze.
I don't know how that happened, sir.
when we left, Mr. Farooq was lying on the ground.
he was breathing.
well, that didn't last for long, did it?
H? Yes, Walter.
I heard about our attempted honor killing;
the father killing his own daughter because she disgraced the family.
if you believe the story.
you're not buying it?
the father's death was not self-defense.
dad, where's Brian? Brian is in holding, Kyle.
is Brian the boyfriend? Yes, he's the boyfriend.
Yeah, he is the boyfriend, and he didn't kill anybody.
Hey, I didn't say he did, kid!
Kyle. Could I have a minute, Walter?
sure.
thank you.
look, Dad, nobody knows him like I do, okay?
Kyle, Kyle? And he didn't kill Rahim Farooq!
this is an active murder investigation.
whether we like it or not, Brian is a suspect.
look, last year, May 28, Anbar Province, there was an IED with my name on it, okay?
if it wasn't for Brian Nassir, then they'd probably still be looking for my body parts.
okay, I just want to make sure that he doesn't get blamed for something that he didn't do.
how we doing?
not so good.
our victim's jacket protected this paper somewhat, but not enough.
and you've tried the glycerin and water solution?
I did. I even added some alcohol and chloral hydrate to soften the paper when I flattened it.
I was hoping to make some sense of the surviving text, but...
so, we will go to the infrared filter.
all right.
you thinking the infrared'll make the text clear? You see, Walter, the metal in the dyes and the ink show up better under infrared than they do with halogen.
look at that, it worked.
can definitely see the text more clearly now, but what language is that?
that is Farsi.
looks like we're gonna need a translator.
Yes, I... I've already got one.
looks like an official document.
the wording is formal, like a contract.
could the line at the bottom be for a signature?
looks like the initial "A
last name Salib.
does that help? It might.
it might, Kyle.
rahim Farooq attempted to arrange a marriage for his daughter with another man named Ahmad.
were you aware of that?
no.
okay.
thank you, son.
good work.
rahim is dead?
how?
he was murdered this morning.
this is a small portion of the marriage contract we found on his body.
it's your signature, yeah?
it is, yes.
were you following Rahim around?
wait, you think I killed him?
what possible reason could I have?
well, he promised you his daughter, you took him at his word, and she ran off with another guy. Hold on.
you're taking this too far. Are we?
witness confirmed seeing you outside of Brian Nassir's garage this morning.
that's the same garage where the body was discovered. Yep.
pulled your pretty face out of a photo lineup.
I've been there, okay?
but-but it certainly wasn't to hurt anyone.
Maya agreed to marry me last year.
but lately her commitment has been waning.
so, I decided to follow her.
find out why.
I saw her kissing that man.
I wanted to make it clear to her father that the marriage, it was off.
she needs to respect the conditions of this agreement.
she will be reminded, and this will be fixed.
Maya has brought dishonor upon both our families.
please, Mr. Farooq, there's no harm done here.
no, she has shamed me.
she has broken a sacred vow, and that cannot be allowed.
look, you're in America now.
if she has found someone else, she deserves to be happy.
tell me where she is.
I was afraid of what he might do, so I lied.
said I saw them together at the mall.
you handled this amazingly well.
you're telling us there were no hard feelings?
I was disappointed, yes.
but life goes on.
for some.
this Maya Farooq's cell phone?
Yeah, take a look at the call history.
she called her dad at 9: 30 this morning.
that's only 40 minutes before Horatio and Kyle arrived.
that's awfully close to the time of the murder.
and I think it's interesting that she didn't mention it in our last conversation.
this conversation was only 12 seconds long.
it's long enough for a voicemail.
her message is stored in the phone company's data system.
I called them and got authorization to access it.
dad, it's Maya.
dad, we need to talk.
it's urgent.
meet me at 193 Avalon.
we have to put an end to this.
that's the address of Brian's garage.
so, she called her dad, said, "I'm here with my new boyfriend."
what do you think?
she was gonna break the news?
I don't know. I mean, "put an end to this" doesn't exactly ooze compromise and understanding.
so, you think they were lying in wait?
maybe.
I'm sure she had access to the family gas can, too.
Yeah, she's definitely holding something back.
why don't you go back to the crime scene, go over it with a fine-tooth comb?
I'm gonna have another conversation with this girl.
Yeah.
okay, Maya, in our last conversation, you never mentioned inviting your father over to Brian's garage this morning.
I didn't think to mention it.
does it really matter? Yes.
I don't understand.
did you lure your father there?
did I lure my...
it was just a message.
okay?
telling him where we were.
look, all I wanted was to come clean with him...
introduce Brian to him.
I thought that if he would see how happy we were together, that he would give us his blessing.
well, unfortunately for you, the only person who can corroborate your story is your boyfriend.
if I knew how crazy he would be,
I never would've told him where we were.
Maya, the more you withhold information from me, the harder it becomes for me to believe you.
so, Romeo and Juliet claim they left before Dad's body was set on fire.
that sounds like they're covering for each other.
sure does. We're gonna need more than circumstantial evidence to prove that, though.
the only problem is, any useful discovery in this whole mess may have accidentally been destroyed by the firefighters.
Yeah, hmm, well...
I think it's that time.
grid search?
layer by layer.
so afraid you were gonna say that.
Oh, wait, wait, Jesse.
come here, take a look at this.
What'd you find?
do you see these two holes right here?
Yeah.
you have any idea where that's from?
Yeah, I think I do.
will you do me a favor?
will you get me the casting resin, please?
Yeah.
so, this hole was made by a heel, huh?
Yeah. High heel, to be exact.
the wearer must have dug their heel into the silt.
it's looking like Maya, isn't it?
well, you know, we can't be sure because she was at Brian's several times, so this could have happened in the days before.
no, it couldn't.
see the ash attached to the resin at the bottom of the heel?
Yeah. It's crushed.
as in, stepped on?
exactly. Means the fire was going when these heels went walking through.
well, Maya said that she left before the fire started.
looks like Maya's lying.
when am I going to see Brian?
it's been hours.
I don't understand.
Maya, if you had been straight with me, it wouldn't have taken hours.
now, you can't go until we look at your shoe, so please place it on the table.
you're right.
Maya's heels are chunkier.
we're looking for ones that are more slender.
may I have your shoe, please?
it's a match.
a match for what?
this is a mold of a high heel shoe print that we found at the scene.
and your shoe matches the exact size, shape and depth.
you were there this morning,
Mrs. Farooq, weren't you?
I never planned on putting my daughter through this.
the scrutiny, the accusation.
but I could not sit back, either, and let this happen.
ahmad told my husband everything.
about Maya, Brian, all of it.
the marriage was off.
rahim came to me... furious.
so, you support this?
you support her?
be reasonable, Rahim.
who are you?
who am I?
who are you?
it's as if you accept her behavior, her betrayal!
if I lose control over this family, what else do I have left?!
Rahim, please...
don't!
I will take care of this myself.
I went there to warn her, protect her.
we found ash from the fire that killed your husband compressed inside the heel print that you left behind at the scene.
which means what?
it means that you stood over your husband while he burned.
when I got there, Rahim's car was parked outside.
he found her.
I could see that something had already happened.
Maya was driving away very fast.
more frightened than I'd ever seen her.
like she was running for her life.
I went in to find my husband.
and there he was, lying there.
he said that he wanted to preserve our family's honor, but there was no honor in that.
what is this?
get me out of this.
you came to kill your daughter?
I'm her father! I must decide what's best!
get me out of this!
the violence must stop.
listen to yourself!
you corrupted our daughter!
no. You!
you did this!
get me out of this, Salumeh! No.
look at what you've become.
you forgot where you came from!
it wasn't me. You forgot who you are!
get me out of this! Salumeh!
get me out of this!
you corrupted our daughter, Salumeh!
you poisoned our daughter!
it wasn't me.
get me out of this!
to do what he did...
I just knew that Maya would never be safe.
how you doing?
I'm not going back, Harmon.
not yet.
she needs me now more than anybody needs me over there.
they extended my furlough.
don't worry, man.
take your time.
I'll be waiting for you.
mom!
it's okay.
take care of each other.
respect each other.
no.
I'm sorry.
no, no.
No! Brian!
I'm proud of you, son.
Thanks, Dad.
you take care of yourself over there.
I will.
okay.
you come back alive, no matter what.
okay? You come back alive. I will. I will.
I'll be right here. Okay.
I love you. I love you. I love you, too.
help!
Oh, my God, there's a kid in there! - Calleigh, wait, it's too dangerous.
your lungs haven't healed from a year ago. - He'll never make it out!
Calleigh, put this over your mouth.
ready? - Ready.
Miami-Dade PD! - Hey! We don't need any more heroes.
Yeah, but you might need an extra set of hands.
there could be others. - I'm going to check downstairs.
Hello, is anybody down here?
are you in here?
Ryan, he's over here! I need help!
is he alive?! - Barely.
come on. Help me up.
I got her!
come on.
come on, come on.
Mr. Wolfe, where's Calleigh?! - She's still inside!
I'm stuck!
are you okay?
I'm fine. She's stuck!
okay. Can you walk?
come on, kid!
I'm sorry, but he's gone.
Hey, wait. I'm-I'm not dead.
there's no white light, no choir of angels. I-I can't be dead.
his hands are burned.
maybe he started the fire or maybe he was playing with matches.
Hey, no-no way! I didn't do that, all right? - I don't know.
that didn't happen!
we gotta go now!
I'm stuck.
hang on!
I gotta call in the M. E. Can I use your phone?
can-can you hear me?
are you okay?
- My belt's stuck!
here we go! Here we go!
get me a paramedic right now!
paramedic!
I'm fine.
she's had respiratory problems before.
Calleigh, we're gonna get you to a hospital. You're gonna be okay, all right?
okay. Thanks.
officer's name is Montoya.
here husband is waiting at the hospital.
hang in there, Leah.
how is she?
too soon to tell. What do you think started this fire, Mr. Wolfe?
I think the kid set the fire. His hands were burned.
I think it was an accident.
okay, or murder. Stay with his body. We see what we see.
got it.
where are they taking my boy?
to the morgue for an autopsy.
we're very sorry about your loss.
I saw Patrick leave for school this morning.
I waved good-bye to him.
he wasn't supposed to be here.
you the boy's father?
grandfather.
I was Patrick's legal guardian.
he's lived here with me since he was ten years old.
why do you think he'd set the fire?
Why? No, he-he wouldn't do that.
no, this-this was our home.
we had almost finished renovating it. Why would he do that?
I was all he had. He was all I had.
Mr. Dawson, anything you can tell me is gonna make this easier.
Patrick wasn't perfect.
he talked back, he broke curfew, and I didn't always approve of his friends, but he was a good kid.
there's no way he would have done this.
okay. Thank you for your help. Frank.
Yeah. Thank you, sir.
Hello, Doctor.
concentration of carbon monoxide in his blood was 70%.
that makes the cause of death asphyxiation.
or you could just say he died of smoke inhalation.
you say potato...
what about his hands?
I'm thinking he may have set the fire.
third-degree full thickness burns.
take a whiff.
Oh, yeah, definitely. It's some sort of chemical.
do you think you could find it somewhere in your heart to get me a sample?
Thanks, Doc.
all right, I am back!
they ran some tests and cleared me for duty.
I wish I could say the same for Officer Montoya.
you know, she's still in the hospital.
okay, Ryan, look, I am sorry.
I know that I should have waited for the fire department.
it was a really stupid thing to do.
Calleigh, Calleigh, Calleigh, you always got to be a hero.
you couldn't have saved that boy.
I know.
he's probably the one that started the fire.
what?
can I take a look?
looks like it's some sort of an oil-based solvent.
Hey, Jesse? Yeah, do me a favor.
find Dawson's painter, because I think this might be arson.
so I found turpentine on Patrick Dawson's hands.
well, that's an accelerant.
I think this kid intentionally set this fire.
what if there's another explanation for the turpentine?
after all, it is a painter's tool.
this house was being renovated.
I talked to the painter on the phone. He said he hadn't worked in this room.
if we find evidence of turpentine, it means that Patrick Dawson set this fire.
now, the body...
the body was found over here.
all right, first things first.
let's locate the area with the deepest charring.
that'll tell us where the fire began.
start measuring.
eight millimeters.
I got 22 millimeters.
nine millimeters.
Twenty-six. - 15 millimeters.
Hey, guys, I think I got the big one: 33 millimeters.
anybody got one deeper than that?
no.
okay, here's the point of origin.
let's see what the MiniRAE picks up.
700 parts per million of turpentine.
maybe the kid did start the fire.
you're wrong! I didn't do this!
you guys feel a draft?
Walter, there's, uh, plenty of room for drafts to come in here.
I don't know, man. This place is weird.
I think you've been watching too many Rob Zombie movies.
we're done here, right?
wait a minute! You're leaving?!
that's it? You don't believe me?
I'm gonna go with Walter.
I don't believe this!
Hey. Check this out.
this house has a sprinkler system.
Hey, I was here during the fire. Believe me, the sprinklers weren't on.
maybe they shut it off during the renovation.
Hey, you know what else, guys?
that's not the only thing wrong here.
I don't see any insulation in this whole mess. Do you?
no passive fire protection. That's highly illegal.
whoever was working on this house, turned it into a killer.
we need to find out who that contractor was.
this is crazy. I didn't start that fire.
you didn't start it, but you allowed it to burn.
you don't know what you're talking about.
I've been building houses for ten years.
everything I did met the minimum code requirements.
what about insulation?
I was going to put it in. I just hadn't gotten around to it yet.
after You already installed the drywall.
look, Dawson had no concept of how much things cost.
he wanted everything done on the cheap. So I went cheap.
sue me. - I'd rather arrest you.
arrest me? For what?
negligent homicide resulting in the death of a 15-year-old boy.
okay, I'm following the fire starting with the point of origin.
there's a strange surface burn on the wall.
it's inconsistent with normal fire movement.
looks like the mark continues out into the hallway.
there's some sort of an oily substance in the burn.
I've got wax paper.
this looks like a second point of origin.
it's a totally different fire from the turpentine.
Hey, Horatio, give me a call when you get a chance.
I'm got a wax paper trail leading to a second point of origin.
it's way to sophisticated for this kid.
I don't think he did it.
thank you.
you're welcome.
y-you heard me?
Yeah.
you-you can see me?
Why?
I don't know.
all right, pull it together.
pull it together, Duquesne.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere until I clear my name.
you believe me, right?
you believe I didn't set the fire?
I don't know what to believe.
would you believe me if I wasn't dead?
I'd have to follow the evidence.
you had burns on your hands.
it's possible those could have come from starting a fire.
but-but they didn't.
Oh, come on, why would I lie?
okay, look, just give me a second, okay?!
it's not like I've ever seen a...
a call to the Dawson's place last month.
why did that happen? - Neighborhood dispute.
and get this-- the neighbor set the lawn on fire.
okay, well, that certainly could escalate an argument, couldn't it?
I am not the criminal here. Henry Dawson is.
why do you say that, ma'am?
his workers aren't supposed to start until 8: 00 a. m.
but there they are every day at 6: 00 making noise.
I work nights. I need my sleep.
why didn't you notify the proper authorities?
I made complaint after complaint to the building department.
nothing was ever done about it.
I had to go to Key West just to get away from the noise.
that sounds real rough.
why did you set the lawn on fire?
I just wanted to send Dawson a message.
did you send him one today?
absolutely not.
where were you this morning?
Sleeping-- or trying to, just like every other morning.
can, uh, anyone confirm that?
isn't that your job?
look, I am done talking about this.
if you can prove I was at that house, you go ahead.
don't leave town.
she's hiding something, Frank.
Yeah.
I'll go up to the house, see if we find anything that puts her there during the fire.
Hey, Tripp, we could be looking at a second point of origin here.
I've got more bits of that same wax paper running all along the upstairs hallway and bedroom.
wax paper's combustible, right?
Yep. Just like any accelerant.
spreads the fire slowly, giving the perpetrator time to escape.
also making sure that the fire travels over a longer distance.
hell, that could have come from our fire-starting neighbor.
well, look what I found downstairs under the sink.
wax paper? - Yeah, and it's almost all used up.
could be the stuff on the wall.
Hey, guys, check this out.
these look like teeth marks to you?
I guess, but what's the deal with the gap in the middle?
here's your gap.
the wax paper came from this box.
I've been trying to quit. For Patrick's sake.
hardly seems important now.
let's talk about the wax paper, Mr. Dawson.
we found this in your kitchen, and it was used to set the fire.
did you set that fire, Mr. Dawson?
no. And I can explain the wax paper.
Patrick and I used it to make paper boats.
it's a hobby we shared since he was a boy.
you guys share any other hobbies?
how about arson? Maybe you guys did it together.
I wasn't even home when the fire started. I was at the market.
fine. The wax paper was in your kitchen.
Patrick had access to it. Maybe he did it alone.
I already told you folks, there's no way Patrick would do this.
you tell 'em, Pops.
we, uh, called Patrick's school.
he's been out sick eight times in the last month.
are you aware of that?
no, I wasn't.
I stayed home to work on the house.
I wanted to surprise you.
you know, according to your will,
Patrick would have inherited the insurance payout.
only in the event of my death.
well, maybe the fire was meant for you, sir.
no, they're wrong, right?
the fire... the fire started in the hallway.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Mr. Dawson, if you think about it, your grandson had 200, 000 reasons to set that fire.
I don't see Patrick doing this.
but maybe.
no. Don't-don't listen to them, Pops.
all right, they got it all wrong.
Hey, Henry Dawson just admitted his grandson might have wanted him dead.
might" isn't good enough, Jesse.
let's discuss it on the way to the hospital.
Dr. Lawrence, dial 112, please.
Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were in Tampa.
I knew you were going to be mad that I went into that house, but you would have done the same thing.
Oh, my God. Look at her.
she looks terrible.
this is worse than I thought.
let's go find Horatio.
that's me.
Eric?! Guys, what's going on?
they can't hear you.
Henry Dawson just admitted his grandson might have wanted him dead.
let's talk about it on the way to the hospital.
Calleigh, Calleigh, Calleigh, you always got to be the hero.
Calleigh, are you okay?
I'm fine.
she's had respiratory problems before.
we're gonna get you to a hospital. You're gonna be okay, all right?
okay.
she's in respiratory distress. Come on, out of the way.
am I dying?
I don't know.
all I know is I see you, and... you see me.
Hey, how's Calleigh?
uh, she's hanging in there. It's good to hear.
stop by there later today.
so, uh, what exactly are we here for?
well, Horatio isn't convinced that the kid intentionally set the fire, so we need to re-attack.
what do we know so far?
well, we found two points of origin.
one fire was started with wax paper by an unknown perpetrator.
right. And the other one was started with turpentine here by the kid.
we got a bunch of paint tools over there.
maybe the boy was using the turpentine to clean some brushes.
well, if that's the case, then it definitely was an accident.
man, you feel that draft?
okay, again with the drafts, man? I get it. You don't like this place.
no, listen, Jesse, I'm telling you...
some sort of breeze coming from this wall.
Hey, pass me one of those feathers.
a feather's not gonna scare away a ghost.
just pass me the feather, please, Cardoza.
feather.
thank you.
you think it still has some loft?
why, you need it to fly?
huh?! See?!
told you, Jesse!
feather floated.
means this wall isn't sealed properly.
Yeah, you're right.
it's like someone put this up to cover up something.
only one way to find out what.
guess we found what they were hiding.
fire damage must have covered up the smell.
he's wearing a uniform.
must be one of the guys working on the house.
Yeah, question is, did he die from the fire or before it?
let's call this in.
meet Ralph Zimmerman, card-carrying member of the plumber's union.
what do we know about Ralph?
he's burned, but he's not in a pugilistic state.
so he died before the fire.
I found ventricular fibrillation on the respiratory muscles which resulted in respiratory paralysis.
we're talking about a heart attack.
and nothing in his medical history to indicate that he should have, but then I found these.
burn marks.
with dry parchment centers and rims of congestion.
those weren't caused by the fire.
electrocution, Doctor.
he was electrocuted through his knees.
but how?
he's a worker.
maybe he was kneeling on the floor.
and maybe that floor was hot.
so Henry Dawson said that the plumbers were over here working on the sink.
Yes, this must be where he got electrocuted.
which begs the question how do you conduct electricity on a linoleum floor?
you start with an exposed wire.
wire's hot.
our dead plumber was working over here.
so how do you conduct electricity from that hot wire all the way over to his knees?
water?
there's a little bit of bubbling here.
bingo. Circular brown stain on the concrete.
that's definitely water damage.
Yeah, water and concrete's a deadly combination.
but why didn't the circuit breaker trip?
this is an old fuse box.
what is that, a penny?
Yeah, it's a common trick in old houses.
these fuses are only 15 amps, so when the power would surge, the fuse would blow.
and the electricity stops flowing.
Yeah, but you stick a penny in the fuse...
electricity keeps flowing.
wires get hotter, they get deadlier.
looks like one of those novelty pennies. What does it say right there?
Horatio said the neighbor just came back from there.
I've already told you people I'm done talking about this.
where did you get that? That's mine!
Mrs. Hollister, you want to do us a favor and just sit down?
I'd prefer to stand, thank you.
we found your penny in Henry Dawson's fuse box.
you put it there when you murdered Ralph Zimmerman.
who?
Dawson's plumber.
Oh, that guy.
he started working at the crack of dawn yesterday.
I went down and very politely asked him to stop making noise.
he did not do as I asked.
Hey! Hey, you in the ugly shorts,
I've been banging on this door for the last 20 minutes!
you cut that out right now!
so you're admitting to, uh, to murdering him.
I didn't murder him.
I treated him in kind.
that's it? That's your explanation?
he ignored me.
he couldn't hear you. He was working.
he could have heard me if it wasn't for the pounding and the banging - and that-that saw, that buzz thing. - Buzz saw?
thank you. It was all day long.
I couldn't get the pounding out of my head.
I hadn't slept for eight months.
I had to stop the noise.
okay, let's just... slow down, get this straight.
you electrocuted him, then you stuck his body in the closet.
you bet I did.
and then I went home...
and I slept like a baby.
it was divine.
so you set the fire to cover up your handiwork.
look, I just confessed to murder.
if I started the fire, I would tell you, believe me.
well, that's the thing, Mrs. Hollister.
we don't.
Hey, Wolfe.
I got something for you.
fire department sent this over.
this is weird.
the fire department said they ran a sprinkler test on Henry Dawson's system and it worked fine.
that means that contractor never turned it off.
so why didn't the water come on during the fire?
maybe somebody didn't want it to.
Yeah, the inspector test valve indicates that water is flowing from the main valve to the supply pipe.
no, no one's tampered with the sprinkler system, and, uh...
it's been a huge waste of time.
Hey, Ryan, wait a minute. I think you're on to something.
this is it.
did we find something?
carbon dioxide sublimates at minus 78 degrees Celsius.
uh, carbon dioxide?
I don't... I don't understand.
are you talking about the fire, or...?
this explains everything.
so how do we tell them?
what's wrong? What's wrong?
Calleigh! Hey!
she's in V-fib. No pulse.
Hey, come on. - Charging to 200.
Calleigh, come on! - Clear!
Calleigh, come on!
asystole.
you're not gonna shock her again?
do something! You have to save her! - That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm gonna give her an amp of epi.
Calleigh, it's okay.
look at me. Look at me.
it's okay. It's all right. It's okay.
Mr. Delko?
Hiya, Doctor. How is she doing?
the smoke this morning aggravated her preexisting lung disease.
well, why did her heart stop?
we're not sure.
but she responded well to the defibrillation and the medication.
she'll be weak for a few hours, she may have trouble speaking, but her exam and test results are normal.
all right, thanks.
don't try to speak. Just relax.
you want to write something down? Okay, calm down.
sw
what does this mean?
okay. All right, I'm going to bring it to him.
just relax.
she wanted me to give you this.
she said she doesn't know what it means; she dreamt it.
this is about the case, Eric.
I know. She's been here all day. It doesn't make sense.
you know what? It makes perfect sense.
she was first on scene. She must have seen something.
the numbers are used by land survey to measure distance.
right, so we've got 48 degrees southwest from the door and nine meters out.
what about the 36?
36 is exactly how deep Miami buries its water lines, Jesse.
well, there you go.
there's the water line.
it feels like the water's flowing fine.
okay.
well, then why did the fire sprinklers not work?
because the water...
wasn't flowing this morning.
take a look at this.
looks like ice.
that is CO2 in solid form.
dry ice.
Yeah, which turns into gas at minus 78 degrees Celsius.
right. So someone used it to freeze the pipe and stop the flow of water.
so, as soon as the ice melted, the water started flowing again.
so whoever set this fire really wanted this to burn.
what is that?
looks like a reddish-brown liquid stain.
I'll get that over to Trace.
no need, Jesse. I know who did this.
I can't see too well without my glasses, son.
you mind telling me what that is?
that's a tobacco stain.
I admit, I don't have the best aim when I'm spitting.
can't say that I knew that that was a crime.
well, it isn't. But murder is.
you tampered with the sprinkler system and caused it to malfunction during a fire that you started.
the same fire that killed your grandson, Mr. Dawson.
and you would've let him take the fall for it.
you murdered your own flesh and blood.
Patrick was supposed to be in school.
he wasn't supposed to be there.
and what I did, I did for both of us, for a better life.
yeah? How's that?
the renovation was supposed to add value to the house.
eight months in, and that shoddy contractor is behind schedule.
and I'm hemorrhaging money.
that house drained me of my last penny.
Patrick and I would've been on the street.
you torched the house for the insurance money.
I just wanted to make our lives better.
Yes, but you failed.
you did this to me.
Mr. Dawson?
take him please.
babe, work will still be here tomorrow.
should be back at the hospital.
Yeah, you know...
you've had this job before.
you know sometimes there are just things you need to do.
it's the strangest thing, but I feel like I knew him.
rest in peace.
Hi! Oh, thank you!
Hi.
Hey, you guys want to say something?
happy anniversary.
want to say something?
Hey, Laura and Chuck.
you're a terrific couple.
happy anniversary.
wonderful parents.
you know what? Great party.
okay, we hate you because you're so damn perfect.
yeah... but congrats, anyway.
Yes. Seriously.
and back to the anniversary party.
Oh, that color looks so good on you.
who picked that dress out?
you did.
that's right.
???
???
???
that's you.
look how cute they were!
Yeah. What happened?
mom, Dad, me and the little man would like to congratulate you on your 20th anniversary.
you're amazing.
because without you, there wouldn't be an us.
Oh, sweetheart.
okay, guys, that's enough about us.
or maybe just a little bit more.
there's, uh, beer and chardonnay, and, oh, there's a few slices of my, uh, carrot cake left.
Yeah. Please get to it before I do.
Where's your brother?
I thought you two were going to play for us.
Oh, it's too late. Everyone's leaving.
okay.
great time, Chuck. Hey, man.
all right, we'll see you soon. Thanks for coming.
see you again, man. Hey, thanks so much.
thank you for coming. Thanks for having us.
we'll see you soon. It was fun, right?
all right. Yeah, it was really fun.
Yeah, good. Yeah, everybody had a good time.
Hey, we'll see you soon. We'll see you soon.
thanks for coming. Okay. See you this week. We'll call you.
okay. Bye.
I just want to say that you're more beautiful now than ever before.
I'm exhausted.
I have to clean up.
okay.
Oh! Those damn kids broke that lamp again.
they're not getting away with this.
this time, I'm getting it on tape.
I know you're out there!
come on out!
I've had enough.
I'm gonna get your face on video, and I'm sending it straight to the cops.
you're not gonna get away with his.
you...
Dr. Loman.
I think we can safely say overkill.
absolutely brutal.
she was struck at least nine times with so much force and velocity that each blow on its own could have been fatal.
what about a murder weapon?
not sure yet.
but judging from her injuries and the varying direction of the blood spatter, whoever did this was swinging wildly from several different directions and angles.
and totally out of control.
and fueled by rage.
Yes. Someone... was very, very angry.
thank you, Doctor.
what've you got so far?
we found the family's video camera.
Mrs. Williams was using it when she was attacked.
so far, I've been retracing the victim's steps through the videotape, and it looks like that broken lamp definitely drew her over here.
well, she could have interrupted an intruder breaking into the house.
maybe panicked and killed her.
Oh! Those damn kids broke that lamp again.
this time, I'm getting you on tape.
come out here!
you're not gonna get away with this!
you see that?
what?
something prevented the blood spatter from landing in that area.
maybe the killer was standing in that void when he attacked.
is that the victim's son?
boa VISTA: Yeah.
sad.
Yeah.
andrea and I were upstairs.
we heard the sirens, and we...
we turned into our driveway, we ran down and...
dad told us Mom was gone.
you're a talented artist, Cody.
I control everything in these pages.
shame it doesn't work like that in real life.
in my book, the bad guy always gets caught.
well, we have a pretty good record, too, son.
you'll catch whoever did this to my mom?
it's highly likely.
you should go inside, get some rest.
I'm gonna need to go over your statement.
a little later?
when you're ready.
you know, the whole anniversary party's on this video.
Oh... my God.
you're not gonna believe what it caught.
take a look at this, Jess.
what?
check it out.
Hey, Cody, are you in there?
woman: Yeah, right.
I want my song! Exactly.
Laura. Hey.
the guests are leaving.
it's time to say good-bye.
excuse me.
I mean, it looks like the victim's husband is having an affair right there at their anniversary party.
well, if that's the case, we have our first suspect.
I can't believe you dragged me in here.
I'm the one who called 911.
I've already told you everything.
well, how about you tell me again?
I was cleaning up the kitchen.
I took a trash bag out to the garage, and I found her body.
Mr. Williams, you don't seem very sad about losing your wife.
is there a handbook on how a grieving husband should act?
do you have any idea how this feels?
Yeah, I do, and if I were lucky enough to be with my wife on our 20th anniversary, she wouldn't walk in and find me with another woman.
What?! I saw the video from your party.
now, who's the woman that your wife caught you with?
that was Bridgette Clark.
she's our neighbor and my son's history teacher.
we were talking about Cody.
your body language implied that maybe it was a little something more.
something more?
something that your wife would take issue with.
now, did you guys argue after the party? No.
do you see how this is stacking up? Your wife thinks you're cheating, she kicks you out of the house, you get angry.
enough! You want...
it's always the husband, right?
they teach you that at cop school?
Mr. Williams, this murder is personal.
we're looking at everyone who was close to her.
look elsewhere.
I have to make funeral arrangements for my wife.
now, can I go?
for now.
Miami National Bank.
how can I help you?
Hey, Dina, it's Eric Delko from the State Attorney's Office.
I need to do some follow-up on the records I had you subpoena.
I need some specific information on Walter Simmons.
Acunt number eight-two-one three-three-two-eight.
Hey.
let me... Can you hold on a second?
I forgot my laptop. Okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back. Thanks.
are you okay?
Yeah. Great. Just, uh, a sea of affidavits and depos here.
you want me to proof something? No. You're already late.
it's fine.
you seem stressed.
no, I just... got to get this to court.
that's all.
all right. I'm going right by there.
you want me to take it?
it's okay.
really. Thanks.
okay.
I'll see you later.
I admit it.
I like the effect I have on men.
I flirt, it's fun.
Chuck's wife just happened to catch it on video.
well, she's dead now.
it's my understanding that you do more than just flirt, Mrs. Clark.
the mother of one of your students filed a complaint with the school board, claiming that you wouldn't leave her husband alone.
she's a lying, jealous bitch.
so, you're saying she's just envious of you?
look at me.
I wear makeup, work out.
most of those soccer moms couldn't find their way to a treadmill if they were given a map and a GPS.
so Chuck Williams just couldn't resist you.
probably not.
but I'm not sleeping with Chuck.
listen, something terrible happened to that woman.
and I'd start with what's going on inside her house.
do you know something that we don't know?
well, there's a little test
I do when I'm worried about a student's home life.
you haven't given your parents any of my notes.
I'm gonna have to talk to them about your behavior.
please don't, Mrs. Clark.
they'll be mad.
Oh, you...
I was pretending to wipe something from his shirt.
that kid almost jumped out of his skin.
what does that tell you?
that Cody thought I was going to hit him.
from my experience, he's being abused.
it turns out there was something going on at the Williams' house.
the police responded to a 911 hang-up call there last month.
they suspected domestic violence.
were charges filed?
no. When the police arrived the husband had taken off, and the wife said everything was fine, and they left.
I'm hoping the video will speak for them.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing that points to Dad on this tape, and I can only work with what's within the frame.
Really? So, it's just Laura.
not exactly.
there is someone sharing the frame with her.
who?
a ghost.
this tape was used before, and it's been recorded over.
but the camera- the eraser heads, they must be damaged or something, because it didn't fully erase the original image.
okay, there.
right-hand corner, you see the painting?
barely.
let me just eliminate the current image.
how about now?
Oh, yeah, it's, um...
like a birthday party.
maybe it's one of the kids' plays?
no, that's at dinner.
can you sharpen that?
if I apply a condensed sensing algorithm the computer should be able to take what little digital information we do have and multiply it, filling in the missing pixels.
it's Thanksgiving.
hold on a sec, let me enhance the audio.
what did you just do?
nothing, I'm just hungry.
you grabbed food with your grubby little hands!
where are your table manners? Don't you see all the work that went into preparing this meal?! CHUCK: Laura, she didn't mean anything by it...
stop it! Come here. Come here! Mom, stop!
if you want to act like an animal,
I will treat you like one.
get down! Get!
Oh, my God.
that poor girl.
what is the mother doing?
is that a dog bowl?
now eat like an animal.
the father wasn't the monster in that house.
it was the mother.
I don't think you appreciate how difficult this is.
I don't see what the problem is here.
Horatio has you looking into who stole the diamonds from the evidence locker.
that's not the part I take issue with.
you're asking me to wear a wire and check my friends' bank statements.
I don't want to do this.
we've been through this, Eric.
you work for the State Attorney's Office.
we need to find out who compromised the lab.
I can tell you that the CSIs are clean, I'm sure.
well, I'm not.
Jesse Cardoza planted an illegal wiretap.
last year, your medical examiner was stealing pills.
I mean, do I need to continue?
listen, I'm not the guy for this job.
okay.
our cases are only as strong as our weakest CSI.
we cannot afford to have evidence kicked because of a dirty lab.
now, what do you have for me?
I subpoenaed tax records and bank statements from everyone at the lab. Okay.
someone made a pretty substantial deposit after the diamonds went missing.
25000
who?
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for it.
who is it, Eric?
his landlord just raised his rent, but the guy's not a thief, okay?
give me a chance, let me look into it.
let me see if there's any evidence missing from other cases.
I set the timeline here.
work fast.
Hey, so we've already gone over this area three times.
murder weapon isn't here.
Yeah, I'm thinking the murderers probably took it with them.
or they left it in their car.
you search that three times?
no. Patrol took a look.
maybe you should go take a look.
maybe we should go take a look.
maybe we should.
Walter, do me a favor. Pop the trunk, will you?
Yeah.
Hey, Wolfe...
yeah?
I got blood spatter on the front bumper and headlight.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
look at that.
that doesn't make sense.
there's no way the blood could've made it from the murder scene all the way here on the street.
which means that this car had to be parked in the driveway during the murder, and moved here after.
which explains the void Jesse found next to the body.
Chuck Williams said this car was parked here all day.
he lied.
I don't know how the blood got on my car.
it happened during the murder.
which also means you moved the car.
Yeah, I did.
makes sense. You want to get rid of the murder weapon before you call 911.
no, that wasn't it.
I had to make room for the ambulance.
I thought maybe the paramedics could still save her.
see, that's funny, 'cause you didn't mention that earlier.
well, obviously, I had a lot on my mind.
I didn't think it was important.
and you didn't mention your wife's abusive behavior, either.
she could be hard on the kids, but she never meant to hurt them.
well, we have videotapes that show the opposite.
what?
Thanksgiving last year.
it was one bad day.
the holidays are especially stressful for Laura.
so you didn't consider this behavior to be a pattern.
no.
I don't think so.
I mean, I travel a lot for business.
well, somebody was home.
how'd you find me?
Cody told us you were at your boyfriend's.
did you find who killed my mom?
we found a piece of videotape.
what video?
it's from Thanksgiving last year, Andrea.
did you mother behave like that often?
would you put that out, please?
looking at the fire calms me down.
always has.
my mom wanted us to be perfect.
that's all.
she was a good mom.
what happened to your wrists?
did you hurt yourself?
come on, tell 'em.
Andrea, they're the police.
okay? You don't need to keep her secret anymore.
she's gone.
I snuck out one night to see Logan...
you are worthless!
I know what you do with that boy!
wait, where do you think you're going?
I'm not done with you yet!
so my mom started handcuffing me to my bed.
she what?
she had a lot of creative ways to punish us.
did you tell anyone?
one time.
I called 911.
she offered them sodas.
I thought if they just looked into my eyes, they would know that she was lying.
when they drove away,
I knew there was nothing we could do.
it's okay.
it's okay, it's not going to happen anymore.
What'd you find?
that's a piece of glass.
could I see your shoes, please?
you've got glass on yours.
so, if we test it, is it going to match the glass we found at the crime scene?
I don't... I don't know.
thank you very much.
you wanted to see me?
take a seat, Mr. Simmons.
I'm gonna cut straight to the chase.
I need you to answer for this deposit.
Hey, Delko.
thanks for watching my back, man.
what are you talking about?
I told you my rent was going up, and Nevins just brought that up to me before she accused me of stealing the diamonds from the evidence locker.
you told her.
how did she make the leap from rent to diamonds?
cause she's been investigating me.
she had my bank statements.
said she was concerned about some big deposit I made.
I mean, you had an explanation, right? Yeah.
my buddy was paying back a loan.
but that's beside the point.
you're the only one I told about my rent going up.
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to put you in the hot seat.
I don't know what you're doing, but just stay the hell away from me, all right?
I don't know. Based on what we have right now,
I think the boyfriend looks good for this.
he had the broken glass in his shoe.
Yeah. I'm not buying the husband's story, though.
I mean, he had to know about the abuse.
I think I might have something to inform your debate.
what do you got?
cod is blunt force trauma to the head.
tram tracks...
indicate something round, and approximately three inches in diameter was used.
that could be a pipe, uh, some kind of handle.
are there any splinters in the wound?
not a one.
makes me think the object was metal.
aluminum bat.
I'm gonna stick with my theory. It's the boyfriend.
he plays baseball for the college team.
didn't find anything down there.
no?
in some ways, I hope we don't find anything.
what's that supposed to mean?
kid was trying to save his girlfriend from Mommy Dearest.
I know what you're talking about.
it's like the line between victim and perpetrator keeps getting blurred.
and it looks like Logan crossed that line.
I told you. I don't know how that bat got in my bag.
then I suppose you also don't know how the broken glass from the victim's light fixture got in your shoe.
actually, I can explain that.
I was at their house today.
you were at the anniversary party?
Yeah, right.
Andrea's mom hated my guts.
she didn't like the fact that her daughter had a boyfriend.
I had to sneak in like a cat burglar if I wanted to see her.
I'll tell you something, Logan.
you strike me as the kind of guy who'd do anything for Andrea.
do you remember what time you left the house?
I'm not sure, but I know Mrs. Williams was in the house when I left.
Oh, my God, Logan. I can't let him take the fall for this.
calm down. No. Listen to me.
I'm telling you, I killed my mother.
do you understand what you're saying?
Yes, I do. I killed her.
Where's Lieutenant Caine?
Andrea, are you trying to protect Logan?
Logan didn't do anything.
I'm the one that hid the bat at his apartment.
Andrea, what are you doing here?
I just couldn't handle it at home anymore.
it's okay.
I'm supposed to go away to school next year.
I couldn't leave Cody alone there with her.
so you killed your mom to protect Cody?
why don't you tell us exactly what happened?
after the party, my mom was mad 'cause we didn't play the piano.
she had that look in her eye.
she slapped me.
I reacted in self-defense.
I grabbed the bat.
I hit her once.
she just went down.
Andrea, your mom was hit nine times.
I respect you,
Delko, investigating the stolen diamonds.
a lot of CSIs wouldn't want to look into their own.
Horatio asked me to look into the evidence
all the evidence in lockup.
that's what I'm doing.
I'm sure it's not one of the CSIs.
well, I'd like to offer you the full support of the Internal Affairs Department.
what you'd like is to take all the credit and sit center stage at all the press conferences after we catch the thief.
I'm not gonna lie, Delko.
I do look good on camera.
listen to me. Don't go telling any of your friends in the press about this yet.
this is more than just diamonds we're talking about.
I been doing some digging.
the numbers don't add up.
what numbers?
don't worry about it, Stetler, all right?
you won't miss your close-ups.
thank you.
Hey, Sully. Thanks for coming. Yeah.
you, uh, said some diamonds went missing.
Yeah, stolen from the evidence locker last week.
Oh, why you coming to me?
I'm retired.
I think some evidence was also stolen from a case you worked a few years ago.
everson. 2006.
wanted to see if it brings back any memories.
Oh, Everson was a...thorn in our side for a couple of years, until we rolled up on his distribution hub in Key Biscayne.
you guys recovered over a million dollars in heroin.
Yeah.
you're saying some of that's missing now?
I'm saying that, just like diamonds, heroin's pretty easy to carry out of the evidence locker.
now, the amount that's in the lockup now is, uh, substantially less than what you logged in.
any chance you wrote the wrong number?
well, no.
I mean, there were five of us there.
we couldn't be off by that much.
you're thinking maybe an inside job.
a cop.
it's not our guys.
that's what I'm gonna find out.
good. Good to see yo Eric.
all right, Sully. Thanks for you help.
good luck.
Hello?
Rebecca, it's Eric.
I need you to meet me at the marina near the south entrance.
look, I know you're upset about Walter Simmons, but I'm interviewing a witness right now in Hialeah.
look, I've got some new leads. It's important.
Oh. Well, uh... it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I can meet you around 8: 00, okay?
I've got to go.
Hi, Cody.
I don't want to talk about my mom.
I know.
you know, sometimes when you have to keep secrets
a lot of secrets - it's pretty hard to decide what the truth really is.
so, why are you talking to me?
cause I'm hoping that you can help me.
do you mind if I look at those?
you're not gonna mess 'em up, are you?
I promise that I won't.
I will be super, super careful.
they're awesome.
Thanks.
it's really good.
so, um, who are all these characters?
they're vigilantes.
totally bad ass.
not scared of anything.
well, this one looks like you.
and that one looks like Andrea.
and who's this one up here, this third one?
is that Logan?
no. That's Bradley.
but I'm probably not supposed to tell you about him.
well, you-you can. You can trust me.
who's Bradley?
he's my little brother.
well, Cody, you don't have a little brother.
I don't anymore.
Cody was telling the truth.
I just found the birth certificate for the Williams' third child.
Bradley Williams, born June '98, Philadelphia?
where is he now?
boa VISTA: Let's see.
deceased as of 2003.
he would've been five years old when he died.
five years old?
Chuck never mentioned losing a son, did he?
is there a death certificate?
cause of death was ruled an accident.
father was out of town.
mother says the child got into the kitchen cabinet, when she wasn't watching him.
he swallowed a fatal dose of lighter fluid.
lighter fluid.
would you put that out, please?
you like playing with fire.
I told you it distracts me.
Bradley didn't just get into that cabinet by himself, did he?
we don't talk about Bradley.
I understand that, but I really need to know about Bradley.
did you leave the lighter fluid out?
no. I would never.
why would he just drink that stuff?
Bradley was smart.
he would never do that.
so what are you trying to tell me?
mom didn't mean to kill him.
what did she mean to do?
she was punishing him for burning a hole in the carpet.
she made him drink the lighter fluid.
he's not breathing!
snap out of it! Snap out of it! Okay?
call 911!
right now!
but the thing is...
???
and she blamed Bradley.
I didn't stand up for him.
it should've been me.
no, it should not have been either one of you.
your parents are supposed to protect you, honey.
they're not supposed to hurt you.
I'm the one that protects me and Cody.
Where's your father in all of this?
I think he was just as afraid of her as we were.
when I told him what she did, he took her side.
he said it was an accident.
but he had to know it wasn't.
it wasn't an accident.
Bradley's death was an accident.
it-it says so in the report.
I had a conversation, Mr. Williams, with your daughter Andrea.
what did she say?
according to Andrea, your wife murdered Bradley.
Laura didn't mean to hurt him.
she'd just get so angry sometimes.
I couldn't get through to her.
but she-she did hurt him.
I tried to stop her.
I-I did.
but she said if I told anyone, that they would take the children away from both of us.
I-I didn't have any options.
that would make murder your last resort, then.
I wish I were that man, but I'm not.
well, I guess that leaves...
the children.
Oh, thanks, Ryan.
I appreciate the extra set of eyes.
so, we're hoping for some trace of the killer here?
Yeah, Horatio does not think that the father did it.
well, it's justifiable homicide, if you ask me.
I agree.
but we're just supposed to analyze the evidence, not pass judgment.
somebody clearly wiped down this bat.
I didn't find a single print or an epithelial.
look at this.
see right here? This is all dried, clotted blood.
so then how did that just transfer onto my glove?
maybe it's not blood.
think you're right.
I think this is ink.
what, from a pen?
no.
no. It's from a marker.
she would get so mad.
and her face would get so ugly.
sometimes it was like she wasn't even a real human.
all she wanted was to hurt me.
so was it getting worse with you and your mom?
things were about to.
andrea was leaving.
that meant three years alone with her.
I wasn't gonna make it.
I need you to tell me what happened last night.
during the party,
I left my marker open on the couch, and that made a huge stain.
I knew my mom would make me pay.
I hid in the garage.
and then she came outside, and she was so angry about a broken light.
and I thought she'd blame me for that, too.
Oh, I just wanted to make her stop.
come out here.
I'm gonna get your face on video, and I'm gonna send it straight to the cops.
you little piece of...
the next thing I knew...
I was looking down at her.
she was just staring off into the distance.
and I felt...
relieved.
relieved?
for one second of my life, I wasn't worried about her coming after me.
then Andrea came outside.
what did I do?
we have to call 911.
no. Give me the bat, go inside, never tell anyone about this.
you understand?
I killed my own mother.
she always said there was something wrong with me.
I guess she was right.
no, Cody.
don't think that.
never think that.
come with me, Cody.
no. No.
no. Don't take him away.
he didn't do it. I did it.
Mr. Williams. I had ink on my hands, I grabbed the bat, I killed her.
that's not what happened.
please...
just let me be a father to my son, for once.
you have to understand, I have to do something.
and you will.
I'm going to talk to the prosecutor, and you and Andrea need to tell the whole story.
will Cody go to prison?
I don't know.
I hope not.
Oh, thank you!
Hey, you guys want to say something?
happy anniversary.
want to say something?
Hey, Laura and Chuck. You're a terrific couple.
happy anniversary.
wonderful parents.
great party.
okay, we hate you because you're so damn perfect.
yeah... but congrats, anyway.
- Seriously.
and back to the anniversary party.
Oh, that color looks so good on you.
who picked that dress out?
you did. - That's right.
that's you.
look how cute they were!
Yeah. What happened?
mom, Dad, me and the little man would like to congratulate you on your 20th anniversary.
you're amazing.
because without you, there wouldn't be an us.
Oh, sweetheart.
okay, guys, that's enough about us.
or maybe just a little bit more.
there's, uh, beer and chardonnay, and, oh, there's a few slices of my, uh, carrot cake left. Yeah.
please get to it before I do.
Where's your brother?
I thought you two were going to play for us.
Oh, it's too late. Everyone's leaving.
okay.
great time, Chuck. - Hey, man.
all right, we'll see you soon. - Thanks for coming.
I just want to say that you're more beautiful now than ever before.
I'm exhausted.
I have to clean up.
okay.
those damn kids broke that lamp again.
they're not getting away with this.
this time, I'm getting it on tape.
I know you're out there!
come on out!
I've had enough.
I'm gonna get your face on video, and I'm sending it straight to the cops.
you're not gonna get away with his.
you...
end of tape
Dr. Loman.
I think we can safely say overkill.
absolutely brutal.
she was struck at least nine times with so much force and velocity that each blow on its own could have been fatal.
what about a murder weapon? - Not sure yet.
but judging from her injuries and the varying direction of the blood spatter, whoever did this was swinging wildly from several different directions and angles.
and totally out of control.
and fueled by rage.
Yes. Someone...
was very, very angry.
thank you, Doctor.
what've you got so far?
we found the family's video camera.
Mrs. Williams was using it when she was attacked.
so far, I've been retracing the victim's steps through the videotape, and it looks like that broken lamp definitely drew her over here.
well, she could have interrupted an intruder breaking into the house.
maybe panicked and killed her.
those damn kids broke that lamp again.
this time, I'm getting you on tape.
come out here! You're not gonna get away with this!
you see that? - What?
something prevented the blood spatter from landing in that area.
maybe the killer was standing in that void when he attacked.
is that the victim's son?
Yeah.
sad.
Yeah.
andrea and I were upstairs.
we heard the sirens, and we...
we turned into our driveway, we ran down and...
dad told us Mom was gone.
you're a talented artist, Cody.
I control everything in these pages.
shame it doesn't work like that in real life.
in my book, the bad guy always gets caught.
well, we have a pretty good record, too, son.
you'll catch whoever did this to my mom?
it's highly likely.
you should go inside, get some rest.
I'm gonna need to go over your statement.
a little later?
when you're ready.
you know, the whole anniversary party's on this video.
Oh... my God.
you're not gonna believe what it caught.
take a look at this, Jess. - What?
check it out.
Hey, Cody, are you in there? - Yeah, right.
I want my song! - Exactly.
Chuck... the guests are leaving.
it's time to say good-bye.
excuse me.
I mean, it looks like the victim's husband is having an affair right there at their anniversary party.
well, if that's the case, we have our first suspect.
I can't believe you dragged me in here.
I'm the one who called 911.
I've already told you everything.
well, how about you tell me again?
I was cleaning up the kitchen.
I took a trash bag out to the garage, and I found her body.
Mr. Williams, you don't seem very sad about losing your wife.
is there a handbook on how a grieving husband should act?
do you have any idea how this feels?
Yeah, I do, and if I were lucky enough to be with my wife on our 20th anniversary, she wouldn't walk in and find me with another woman.
What?! - I saw the video from your party.
now, who's the woman that your wife caught you with?
that was Bridgette Clark. She's our neighbor and my son's history teacher.
we were talking about Cody.
your body language implied that maybe it was a little something more.
something more? - Something that your wife would take issue with.
now, did you guys argue after the party? - No.
do you see how this is stacking up?
your wife thinks you're cheating, she kicks you out of the house, you get angry.
enough! - You want...
it's always the husband, right?
they teach you that at cop school?
Mr. Williams, this murder is personal.
we're looking at everyone who was close to her.
look elsewhere.
I have to make funeral arrangements for my wife.
now, can I go?
for now.
Miami shores savings debits transaction account activity
Miami National Bank. How can I help you?
Hey, Dina, it's Eric Delko from the State Attorney's Office.
I need to do some follow-up on the records I had you subpoena.
I need some specific information on Walter Simmons.
account number eight-two-one three-three-two-eight.
let me... Can you hold on a second?
I forgot my laptop. - Okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back. Thanks.
are you okay? - Yeah. Great.
just, uh, a sea of affidavits and depos here.
you want me to proof something? - No. You're already late.
it's fine. You seem stressed.
no, I just... got to get this to court. That's all.
all right. I'm going right by there. You want me to take it?
it's okay. Really. Thanks.
okay. I'll see you later.
I admit it.
I like the effect I have on men.
I flirt, it's fun.
Chuck's wife just happened to catch it on video.
well, she's dead now.
it's my understanding that you do more than just flirt, Mrs. Clark.
the mother of one of your students filed a complaint with the school board, claiming that you wouldn't leave her husband alone.
she's a lying, jealous bitch.
so, you're saying she's just envious of you?
look at me. I wear makeup, work out.
most of those soccer moms couldn't find their way to a treadmill if they were given a map and a GPS.
so Chuck Williams just couldn't resist you.
probably not. But I'm not sleeping with Chuck.
listen, something terrible happened to that woman.
and I'd start with what's going on inside her house.
do you know something that we don't know?
well, there's a little test I do when I'm worried about a student's home life.
you haven't given your parents any of my notes.
I'm gonna have to talk to them about your behavior.
please don't, Mrs. Clark. They'll be mad.
Oh, you...
I was pretending to wipe something from his shirt.
that kid almost jumped out of his skin.
what does that tell you?
that Cody thought I was going to hit him.
from my experience, he's being abused.
call: domestic violence suspected
it turns out there was something going on at the Williams' house.
the police responded to a 911 hang-up call there last month.
they suspected domestic violence. - Were charges filed?
no. When the police arrived the husband had taken off, and the wife said everything was fine, and they left.
I'm hoping the video will speak for them.
I'm sorry, but there's nothing that points to Dad on this tape, and I can only work with what's within the frame.
Really? So, it's just Laura.
not exactly. There is someone sharing the frame with her.
who? - A ghost.
this tape was used before, and it's been recorded over.
but the camera - the eraser heads, they must be damaged or something, because it didn't fully erase the original image.
okay, there. Right-hand corner, you see the painting?
barely.
let me just eliminate the current image.
how about now?
Oh, yeah, it's, um...
like a birthday party.
maybe it's one of the kids' plays?
no, that's at dinner. Can you sharpen that?
if I apply a condensed sensing algorithm the computer should be able to take what little digital information we do have and multiply it, filling in the missing pixels.
it's Thanksgiving.
hold on a sec, let me enhance the audio.
what did you just do?
nothing, I'm just hungry.
you grabbed food with your grubby little hands!
where are your table manners?
don't you see all the work that went into preparing this meal? - Laura, she didn't mean anything by it...
stop it! Come here. Come here! - Mom, stop!
if you want to act like an animal, I will treat you like one.
get down! Get!
Oh, my God. - That poor girl.
what is the mother doing? Is that a dog bowl?
now eat like an animal.
the father wasn't the monster in that house.
it was the mother.
I don't think you appreciate how difficult this is.
I don't see what the problem is here.
Horatio has you looking into who stole the diamonds from the evidence locker.
that's not the part I take issue with.
you're asking me to wear a wire and check my friends' bank statements.
I don't want to do this.
we've been through this, Eric. You work for the State Attorney's Office.
we need to find out who compromised the lab.
I can tell you that the CSIs are clean, I'm sure.
well, I'm not.
Jesse Cardoza planted an illegal wiretap.
last year, your medical examiner was stealing pills.
I mean, do I need to continue?
listen, I'm not the guy for this job.
okay.
we cannot afford to have evidence kicked because of a dirty lab.
now, what do you have for me?
I subpoenaed tax records and bank statements from everyone at the lab.
okay.
someone made a pretty substantial deposit after the diamonds went missing. $25, 000.
who?
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for it.
who is it, Eric?
his landlord just raised his rent, but the guy's not a thief, okay?
give me a chance, let me look into it.
let me see if there's any evidence missing from other cases.
I set the timeline here. Work fast.
Hey, so we've already gone over this area three times.
murder weapon isn't here.
Yeah, I'm thinking the murderers probably took it with them.
or they left it in their car. You search that three times?
no. Patrol took a look.
maybe you should go take a look.
maybe we should go take a look.
maybe we should.
Walter, do me a favor. Pop the trunk, will you?
Yeah.
Hey, Wolfe... - Yeah?
I got blood spatter on the front bumper and headlight.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Look at that.
that doesn't make sense.
there's no way the blood could've made it from the murder scene all the way here on the street.
which means that this car had to be parked in the driveway during the murder, and moved here after.
which explains the void Jesse found next to the body.
Chuck Williams said this car was parked here all day.
he lied.
I don't know how the blood got on my car.
it happened during the murder.
which also means you moved the car.
Yeah, I did.
makes sense. You want to get rid of the murder weapon before you call 911.
no, that wasn't it. I had to make room for the ambulance.
I thought maybe the paramedics could still save her.
see, that's funny, cause you didn't mention that earlier.
well, obviously, I had a lot on my mind. I didn't think it was important.
and you didn't mention your wife's abusive behavior, either.
she could be hard on the kids, but she never meant to hurt them.
well, we have videotapes that show the opposite.
what? - Thanksgiving last year.
it was one bad day.
the holidays are especially stressful for Laura.
so you didn't consider this behavior to be a pattern.
no. I don't think so.
I mean, I travel a lot for business.
well, somebody was home.
how'd you find me?
Cody told us you were at your boyfriend's.
did you find who killed my mom?
we found a piece of videotape.
what video?
it's from Thanksgiving last year, Andrea.
did you mother behave like that often?
would you put that out, please?
looking at the fire calms me down.
always has.
my mom wanted us to be perfect. That's all.
she was a good mom.
what happened to your wrists? Did you hurt yourself?
come on, tell 'em. Andrea, they're the police.
okay? You don't need to keep her secret anymore. She's gone.
I snuck out one night to see Logan...
you are worthless!
I know what you do with that boy!
wait, where do you think you're going? I'm not done with you yet!
so my mom started handcuffing me to my bed.
she what?
she had a lot of creative ways to punish us.
did you tell anyone?
one time.
I called 911.
she offered them sodas.
I thought if they just looked into my eyes, they would know that she was lying.
when they drove away,
I knew there was nothing we could do.
it's okay. It's okay, it's not going to happen anymore.
What'd you find?
that's a piece of glass.
could I see your shoes, please?
you've got glass on yours.
so, if we test it, is it going to match the glass we found at the crime scene?
I don't... I don't know.
thank you very much.
you wanted to see me?
take a seat, Mr. Simmons.
I'm gonna cut straight to the chase.
I need you to answer for this deposit.
Hey, Delko.
thanks for watching my back, man.
what are you talking about?
I told you my rent was going up, and Nevins just brought that up to me before she accused me of stealing the diamonds from the evidence locker.
you told her.
how did she make the leap from rent to diamonds?
cause she's been investigating me.
she had my bank statements.
said she was concerned about some big deposit I made.
I mean, you had an explanation, right?
Yeah. My buddy was paying back a loan. But that's beside the point.
you're the only one I told about my rent going up.
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to put you in the hot seat.
I don't know what you're doing, but just stay the hell away from me, all right?
I don't know. Based on what we have right now,
I think the boyfriend looks good for this.
he had the broken glass in his shoe.
Yeah. I'm not buying the husband's story, though.
I mean, he had to know about the abuse.
I think I might have something to inform your debate.
what do you got?
cod is blunt force trauma to the head.
tram tracks...indicate something round, and approximately three inches in diameter was used.
that could be a pipe, uh, some kind of handle.
are there any splinters in the wound?
not a one. Makes me think the object was metal.
aluminum bat.
I'm gonna stick with my theory. It's the boyfriend.
he plays baseball for the college team.
didn't find anything down there.
no?
in some ways, I hope we don't find anything.
what's that supposed to mean?
kid was trying to save his girlfriend from Mommy Dearest.
I know It's like the line between victim and perpetrator keeps getting blurred.
and it looks like Logan crossed that line.
I told you. I don't know how that bat got in my bag.
then I suppose you also don't know how the broken glass from the victim's light fixture got in your shoe.
actually, I can explain that. I was at their house today.
you were at the anniversary party?
Yeah, right. Andrea's mom hated my guts.
she didn't like the fact that her daughter had a boyfriend.
I had to sneak in like a cat burglar if I wanted to see her.
I'll tell you something, Logan.
you strike me as the kind of guy who'd do anything for Andrea.
do you remember what time you left the house?
I'm not sure, but I know Mrs. Williams was in the house when I left.
Oh, my God, Logan. I can't let him take the fall for this.
calm down. - No. Listen to me.
I'm telling you, I killed my mother.
do you understand what you're saying? - Yes, I do. I killed her.
Where's Lieutenant Caine?
Andrea, are you trying to protect Logan?
Logan didn't do anything.
I'm the one that hid the bat at his apartment.
Andrea, what are you doing here?
I just couldn't handle it at home anymore.
it's okay.
I'm supposed to go away to school next year.
I couldn't leave Cody alone there with her.
so you killed your mom to protect Cody?
why don't you tell us exactly what happened?
after the party, my mom was mad 'cause we didn't play the piano.
she had that look in her eye.
she slapped me.
I reacted in self-defense. I grabbed the bat.
I hit her once.
she just went down.
Andrea, your mom was hit nine times.
bag of cash
I respect you, Delko, investigating the stolen diamonds.
a lot of CSIs wouldn't want to look into their own.
Horatio asked me to look into the evidence
all the evidence in lockup.
that's what I'm doing.
I'm sure it's not one of the CSIs.
well, I'd like to offer you the full support of the Internal Affairs Department.
what you'd like is to take all the credit and sit center stage at all the press conferences after we catch the thief.
I'm not gonna lie, Delko.
I do look good on camera.
listen to me. Don't go telling any of your friends in the press about this yet.
this is more than just diamonds we're talking about.
I been doing some digging.
the numbers don't add up.
what numbers?
don't worry about it, Stetler, all right? You won't miss your close-ups.
thank you.
Hey, Sully. Thanks for coming.
Yeah.
you, uh, said some diamonds went missing.
Yeah, stolen from the evidence locker last week.
Oh, why you coming to me? I'm retired.
I think some evidence was also stolen from a case you worked a few years ago.
everson. 2006.
wanted to see if it brings back any memories.
Oh, Everson was a ... thorn in our side for a couple of years, until we rolled up on his distribution hub in Key Biscayne.
you guys recovered over a million dollars in heroin.
Yeah.
you're saying some of that's missing now?
I'm saying that, just like diamonds, heroin's pretty easy to carry out of the evidence locker.
now, the amount that's in the lockup now is, uh, substantially less than what you logged in.
any chance you wrote the wrong number?
well, no. I mean, there were five of us there.
we couldn't be off by that much.
you're thinking maybe an inside job.
a cop.
it's not our guys.
that's what I'm gonna find out.
good. Good to see yo Eric.
thanks for you help. - Good luck.
Hello?
Rebecca, it's Eric.
I need you to meet me at the marina near the south entrance.
look, I know you're upset about Walter Simmons, but I'm interviewing a witness right now in Hialeah.
look, I've got some new leads. It's important.
Oh. Well, uh...
it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
I can meet you around 8: 00, okay? I've got to go.
I don't want to talk about my mom.
I know.
you know, sometimes when you have to keep secrets
a lot of secrets - it's pretty hard to decide what the truth really is.
so, why are you talking to me?
cause I'm hoping that you can help me.
do you mind if I look at those?
you're not gonna mess 'em up, are you?
I promise that I won't. I will be super, super careful.
they're awesome.
Thanks.
it's really good.
so, um, who are all these characters?
they're vigilantes. Totally bad ass.
not scared of anything.
well, this one looks like you.
and that one looks like Andrea.
and who's this one up here, this third one? Is that Logan?
no. That's Bradley.
but I'm probably not supposed to tell you about him.
well, you-you can. You can trust me.
who's Bradley?
he's my little brother.
well, Cody, you don't have a little brother.
I don't anymore.
Cody was telling the truth.
I just found the birth certificate for the Williams' third child.
Bradley Williams, born June '98, Philadelphia?
where is he now?
let's see.
deceased as of 2003.
he would've been five years old when he died.
five years old? Chuck never mentioned losing a son, did he?
is there a death certificate?
cause of death was ruled an accident.
father was out of town.
mother says the child got into the kitchen cabinet, when she wasn't watching him.
he swallowed a fatal dose of lighter fluid.
lighter fluid.
would you put that out, please?
you like playing with fire.
I told you it distracts me.
Bradley didn't just get into that cabinet by himself, did he?
we don't talk about Bradley.
I understand that, but I really need to know about Bradley.
did you leave the lighter fluid out?
no. I would never.
why would he just drink that stuff?
Bradley was smart.
he would never do that.
so what are you trying to tell me?
mom didn't mean to kill him.
what did she mean to do?
she was punishing him for burning a hole in the carpet.
she made him drink the lighter fluid.
he's not breathing!
snap out of it! Snap out of it! Okay?
call 911!
right now!
but the thing is...
I burnt the carpet.
and she blamed Bradley.
I didn't stand up for him.
it should've been me.
no, it should not have been either one of you.
your parents are supposed to protect you, honey.
they're not supposed to hurt you.
I'm the one that protects me and Cody.
Where's your father in all of this?
I think he was just as afraid of her as we were.
when I told him what she did, he took her side.
he said it was an accident.
but he had to know it wasn't.
it wasn't an accident.
Bradley's death was an accident.
it-it says so in the report.
I had a conversation, Mr. Williams, with your daughter Andrea.
what did she say?
according to Andrea, your wife murdered Bradley.
Laura didn't mean to hurt him.
she'd just get so angry sometimes.
I couldn't get through to her.
but she-she did hurt him.
I tried to stop her. I-I did.
but she said if I told anyone, that they would take the children away from both of us.
I-I didn't have any options.
that would make murder your last resort, then.
I wish I were that man, but I'm not.
well, I guess that leaves... the children.
Oh, thanks, Ryan. I appreciate the extra set of eyes.
so, we're hoping for some trace of the killer here?
Yeah, Horatio does not think that the father did it.
well, it's justifiable homicide, if you ask me.
I agree. But we're just supposed to analyze the evidence, not pass judgment.
somebody clearly wiped down this bat.
I didn't find a single print or an epithelial.
look at this.
see right here? This is all dried, clotted blood.
so then how did that just transfer onto my glove?
maybe it's not blood.
think you're right.
I think this is ink.
what, from a pen?
no.
no. It's from a marker.
she would get so mad.
and her face would get so ugly.
sometimes it was like she wasn't even a real human.
all she wanted was to hurt me.
so was it getting worse with you and your mom?
things were about to.
andrea was leaving.
that meant three years alone with her.
I wasn't gonna make it.
Cody, I need you to tell me what happened last night.
during the party,
I left my marker open on the couch, and that made a huge stain.
I knew my mom would make me pay.
I hid in the garage.
and then she came outside, and she was so angry about a broken light.
and I thought she'd blame me for that, too.
Oh, I just wanted to make her stop.
come out here.
I'm gonna get your face on video, and I'm gonna send it straight to the cops.
you little piece of...
the next thing I knew...
I was looking down at her.
she was just staring off into the distance.
and I felt... relieved.
relieved?
for one second of my life, I wasn't worried about her coming after me.
then Andrea came outside.
what did I do?
we have to call 911.
no. Give me the bat, go inside, never tell anyone about this. You understand?
I killed my own mother.
she always said there was something wrong with me.
I guess she was right. - No, Cody.
don't think that. Never think that.
come with me, Cody.
no. No. No. Don't take him away.
he didn't do it. I did it. - Mr. Williams.
I had ink on my hands, I grabbed the bat, I killed her.
that's not what happened.
please...
just let me be a father to my son, for once.
you have to understand, I have to do something.
and you will. I'm going to talk to the prosecutor, and you and Andrea need to tell the whole story.
will Cody go to prison?
I don't know. I hope not.
20 MINUTES EARLIER
Hey, Calleigh.
Hey, I thought we were supposed to meet for coffee.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I - I got pulled away.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Uh, I'm downtown, about to step into court.
is everything okay?
Yeah, sure.
okay.
I'll talk to you in a bit.
okay.
what are you doing?
Calleigh, where did you come from?
why did you lie to me?
I didn't lie to you.
Yes, you did.
Calleigh, look, can we not do this now?
you drove right past me at PD.
you followed me here?
of course I did.
you've been acting strange, and now you're lying to me.
what time can I get in to see Talbot?
Yeah, I'm not lying.
are you still working for the A.S.A?
I never stopped working for the state attorney's office when I came back to the lab.
but you both have offices, so why are you here? Calleigh.
does this have something to do with Walter?
are you building some sort of a case against him?
what? No! No.
well, then are you the reason why people are getting dragged into Rebecca's office?
you don't know what you're talking about.
then why don't you tell me the truth?
I'll explain later, okay? When there's time.
fine.
whatever works for you.
Eric, are you okay?
Eric, are you okay?
please stand.
we're live now at the Asher Business Park in East Miami, where a suspected car bombing has rocked the city and the state now that word is out that this may have been an assassination.
Walter, EDRK on the Hummer?
Yeah, but you got to get it yourself.
I'm looking for another patrolman.
Eric, you okay?
Yeah.
what happened?
supposed to meet Nevins here.
I... I found something big, H.
I was going to tell her.
I...
I got into a conversation with Calleigh.
if that hadn't happened,
I - I would've been standing right next to her.
what did you find for Nevins?
the theft from the evidence lockup, it's...
there's more to it than the missing diamonds.
there's a half a million dollars in seized heroin that's
it's missing, it's gone.
you're sure about this? Yeah.
I chased the paper on the Everson case from 2006.
I - I checked the evidence inventory...
it doesn't match up.
Eric, the Everson case of 2006 was Sully's case.
Yeah, he gave me some information yesterday.
this bomb could've been meant for you.
who else knows about this?
no one.
Eric, she was our friend.
let's not forget it.
Hey, partner.
missed a good day out on the Gulf Stream.
not your thing, I know.
I understand you spoke to Eric Delko yesterday.
he came to me, yeah.
wanted to talk to an old retired cop about an old case.
specifically, the Everson case.
Yeah, he said evidence has gone missing.
it has... Sully.
well, what do you want from me?
have you talked to anybody else about it?
of course not.
Why?
somebody tried to assassinate Eric today.
they what?
clearly, Sully, he's getting close to something.
you think a cop did all this.
has to be somebody inside, doesn't it?
what do you want me to do?
need you to keep your ear to the ground, and if you hear anything, you let me know.
you bet.
okay.
here you go.
Oh, thanks.
listen, if you, um... ever need to talk...
thank you.
you know, Jesse, I keep finding all of this thin granular residue on the bomb site, and it's not dust.
there's more on the door panel; will you check it out?
Yeah, it's some sort of white residue.
you notice that smell?
Yeah.
smells like fuel.
at first, I thought it was the car,
that means we're looking at ANFO.
ammonium nitrate fuel oil.
that would explain the extent of the damage.
well, the bomb clearly originated from that car.
all right, bye.
you know, we need to find the detonator.
will you make sure the separate sectors go back in different vehicles?
Thanks.
Hey, flatbed's on the way.
we'll clear the scene when it's ready for transport.
what do you know, Eric?
nothing more than you do, Natalia.
come on, you got to drop the act.
I mean, really, look at this.
Nevins is dead!
this case has officially dropped in all of our laps, so you got to come clean about this, about everything.
come clean about what?
she deserves to know.
everyone deserves to know.
know what?
she had me wearing a wire.
a wire?!
you agreed to that?
evidence was going missing from the lab.
so you were spying on us?
everyone was a suspect on the stolen diamonds and the heroin.
okay? If it wasn't me, it was going to be someone that wasn't going to protect you.
you're a real hero, Delko.
boa VISTA: Okay, okay, it's not as simple as it all seems.
and you -- you knew about this the whole time?
I'm sorry.
some team.
I was doing it to protect you guys!
you almost got yourself killed.
how's that protecting anyone?
Hey, Delko.
when you get a sec.
you know a lot about cars.
Yeah.
so from what I can see, every VIN on this car was stripped before the blast.
what do you think?
you know what, let's start with what's left of the suspension system.
Yeah, what are you thinking?
pass me that saw, please.
Thanks.
got a hydraulic pump.
or what's left of it, anyway.
this car had a hydraulic suspension.
well, you know what?
a serial number can be just as useful as a VIN.
all right, let's start with a search of local auto shops.
a serial number could get us the owner of the bomb car.
all right.
all right, the hydraulics were installed on an '86 Cutlass.
hmm, that makes sense.
the size and shape of the wreckage could belong to a Cutlass.
well, here's the VIN number.
any details on the car?
vehicle records say that this car was shot up in a bank robbery in '08.
bank robbery?
who owns the car?
we do.
this car is supposed to be in our impound yard.
what?
Hey, let the phone ring.
sorry.
um, let's see. Sorry.
Yes, I think this is the car you're looking for.
a 1986 Cutlass.
uh, was seized by Major Crimes in 2008.
um, let's see... impounded here two weeks later.
even mentions the... That's our bomb car.
who signed it out?
uh, that would be a Detective, uh, Steven Carmichael.
Carmichael pulled the vehicle for Undercover Task Force in March.
I need to use your computer. Yeah, of course.
of course, just...
all right, let me ask you this.
so you signed it out, he never brought it back.
and that didn't bother you?
well, no, I - I have heard nothing about this.
this is the first time. Got something.
Carmichael pulled another car out a month earlier.
sounds like a pattern to me.
look, I just got out of the academy like two months ago, all right?
this is way before my time.
pull all requisitions signed by Carmichael.
of course.
Carmichael's in Narco.
his file's flagged "restricted"
that'll make it tough to track him down.
let's start with his last case.
I need you to make copies of these for me. Thanks. Yes, sir.
Hey, easy.
have a seat, Tino.
what is this?
looking for a known associate of yours.
associate?
you mean cop.
Carmichael was investigating you, and he just disappeared.
well, I guess that's too bad, isn't it?
it's too bad, huh?
where is he?
screw you.
screw us? Yeah.
does Carmichael still work for you?!
that undercover pig never worked for me.
he's responsible for almost $3 million in missing evidence.
you understand me?
cars, diamonds, narcotics.
that sounds just like my type of guy.
tino, where is he?
dropped him off somewhere between here and Key West.
when was that?
summer of '08 sometime.
so you're saying you killed him.
well, there ain't gonna be much left to find.
maybe the anchor he went down with.
H, that car didn't go missing till March, 2010.
tino, you're a liar.
why would I do that?
I'm sitting here doing life, Chief.
honesty's my new policy, all right?
now, however, I just told you two that I 86'd a cop, and you're going on here about some car?
you guys are getting played, seems to me.
yo, C. O.
let's go, get out of here.
huh? Huh?
you guys are gettin' played.
what did you get from Garvez?
it turns out that the car used in the bombing was checked out of impound by a police officer named Carmichael.
used the name of a dead cop - we got a mess.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to start pulling files on Carmichael and I want you to keep me in the loop.
you don't do interviews without me.
got it.
I'm just saying, I've never stolen anything, ever.
I don't even know Delko all that well.
come to think of it, that's probably why he set his sights on me in the first place.
I don't think that's true, Walter.
these metal sprockets that Natalia recovered from the scene might actually be helpful.
you don't think they came from the vehicles?
no.
we collected hundreds of them.
I bet you they were part of the bomb.
well, take a look at this.
I think I just found the ignition device.
what?
what is that?
some kind of toy rocket engine? Yeah, it makes sense.
motor uses a composite propellant.
the engine cap forces the gas and flames into the nozzle.
surefire way to ignite a hundred pounds of ANFO.
Yeah, but what ignites that thing?
what ignites that?
a cell phone.
the bomb was detonated remotely.
come to Daddy.
I found eight different kinds of sprockets in all this debris.
all right, Wolfe, follow me.
sprockets are gears used in motors.
if we can match the sprocket with the motor, like here...
these sprockets are all used in golf carts.
great, golf carts.
there's only a million of those in Miami.
we found hundreds of those sprockets, though.
but you know what, Walter?
I don't think we're looking for someone who owns a golf cart.
I think we're looking for someone who repairs golf carts.
drew Pollack, let me ask you something.
how is the golf cart business these days?
everybody over 50 in Miami has one, so business is good.
good. So you recognize these?
cause what I think, is that they're parts used in golf carts.
Yeah. So?
so, you used them to make bombs.
like the one you used today to kill Rebecca Nevins.
what?
what are you talking about?
don't play dumb, Pollack.
we know you built a bomb in 1999 that blew up a restaurant using the exact some signature as the one today.
toy rocket cell phone trigger.
that was a long time ago.
look, I... I cooperated with the state attorney.
the state attorney was, uh, Rebecca Nevins.
she prosecuted the case, right?
Yeah, yeah, she's the reason I'm out.
that's right.
she made a deal with you. You copped a plea.
but you still got ten years.
I don't know, that feels like revenge to me.
listen to me, Pollack, we know you're a rat.
and I'm going to give you a chance to help yourself.
how did you get the car out of the police impound, huh?
who are you working with?
I want my lawyer.
this is Dr. Tom Loman.
I am continuing the autopsy of Rebecca Nevins.
X-raying the remains with a digital fluoroscope.
victim suffered massive concussive injuries.
brain mass was pulverized and badly misshapen.
cardiac sac was desiccated.
heart muscle completely severed from arterial structure.
lungs bisected and torn.
liver shredded.
victim suffered dislocation of the spine at the seventh cervical juncture.
an appearance of shrapnel is noted throughout the body.
good God.
I will attempt to remove offending items with rubber tweezers, so as to preserve evidentiary value.
assist, please. Up.
thank you, sir.
I just pulled a GPS chip from Nevins' body.
okay, the GPS in her car was intact.
so this has to belong to the bomb car.
if the bomber used Nav, then a reverse journey will take us right back to him.
female VOICE: Destination in one quarter mile.
we got backup. Good.
so, are you still wearing it?
no.
I'm not wearing the wire.
are you sure?
Calleigh, I stopped wearing it.
destination in 1, 000 feet.
cause I don't want to think about it.
think about what?
what are you talking about?
were you wearing it when we were together?
destination in 500 feet.
were you wearing the wire when we were at home?
you have arrived at your destination.
Calleigh, listen to me.
I wasn't wearing the wire when we were home together.
Hey. That's Ryan's.
the car bomb started here?
no one really believes that Ryan did any of this, do they?
well, we know it was someone on the inside, so we do what we got to do.
Hey! Hey, careful with his stuff.
he's one of us. Hey!
I just don't feel good about doing any of this.
Yeah, me, neither.
I guess just look at it as not searching a suspect, but a way to exonerate Wolfe.
Yeah, well, Wolfe's here. Hey, Wolfe's here.
okay. Don't stop searching.
search.
I'll go talk to him.
the hell is going on here?!
stop.
you can't go inside. Oh, I can't go inside?
this is my place. Ryan.
I said stop! It's okay.
he can come in. It's okay.
those are my clubs. Hey!
what is going on here? Is this some kind of joke?
what is IA doing here?
okay, look, the GPS coordinates from the car bomb led us back here.
where were you this morning?
you think I had something to do with the bomb?
are you serious? I don't know.
are you kidding me? ! and what is he doing here?
Hey, I'm just trying to help.
Oh, you're just trying to help?
what's the matter?
your investigation with Walter hit a dead end, Eric?
speaking of which, make yourself at home,
Walter, please. Don't get up.
all you guys can take a look around.
go through whatever you want.
you're going to find anything, so ha, ha, ha.
Eric, what are you doing?
those aren't mine.
of course, they're not. You stole them.
no, I mean I didn't put them there!
I did not put them there.
I have no idea how they got there.
someone is trying to set me up.
do you see what's going on here?
you guys got to believe me. Someone's trying to set me up here. It's not me.
take him, please.
thanks a lot.
what happened? You have some old gambling debts to pay off, so you stole the diamonds?
you steal the car, the heroin, all that?
I haven't gambled in four years, Rick.
was Nevins getting too close?
you think I murdered Nevins?
you better come out and say it, buddy.
well, the evidence that you trust so much is leading us all one way.
that's kind of how somebody wants it to look, isn't it?
Mr. Wolfe, back off right now.
Mr. Wolfe was the last person to see the diamonds before they went missing, Horatio.
I was in the evidence locker.
I was counting the diamonds.
I put them back in the bin.
then I signed out with an officer.
and that is by the book, Rick.
he was the last person in the chain of custody, and the diamonds were found at his house.
I was also the one who reported them missing.
Oh, and thanks to two of your CSIs, we also know the bomb car originated from Wolfe's house.
he's a prime suspect here.
this is an active investigation, my friend.
no. You're done.
I let you try it your way, and A.S.A. Nevins got killed.
so, cuff him now, please.
those are not necessary.
it's by the book, Horatio.
you guys seeing this?
they're dragging Wolfe away in cuffs.
this isn't right.
we - we got to do something.
well, I'm getting nothing here.
well, whoever framed Ryan killed Nevins.
Yeah, they also knew how to make themselves invisible.
I mean, there's no prints, no usable trace, no DNA.
there's no human DNA.
what are you doing?
is this a new identification process?
brand-new. Just read about it in a journal.
well, what is it?
well, every time we touch an object
anything, from, um, a keyboard to a steering wheel... To the diamonds?
exactly. We leave behind a distinct bacterial signature that's consistent for up to two weeks.
so, you're saying we can tell who handled the diamonds by the bacteria they left behind?
exactly.
we each have a unique little set of creatures that are crawling on our skin.
kind of makes you want to lose your lunch, doesn't it?
this bacterial signature won't match 87% of the population.
well, then, we need to get elimination samples from everybody in the lab.
starting with Ryan.
Yeah, look, something about Nevins' connection to Pollack was bugging me, so I looked deeper into her case against him.
you're not going to believe what I found.
I didn't blow up that restaurant.
well, next time, don't use your own cell phone as the trigger, genius, and maybe I'll believe you.
Sully, better fix your lunch order before Parker hits the road.
sit tight, rocket man.
I'm not done with you.
Sully was the lead Detective.
he's the only one I told about my investigation.
if he's a dirty cop, he'd have every reason to want Nevins and me dead.
how do you want to handle it?
I'll talk to him.
taking a trip, Sully?
heading out to Government Cut.
tarpon are schooling.
drew Pollack, Sully. Who?
drew Pollack, the bomber from '99.
Yeah, I worked that case ten years ago.
he killed Rebecca Nevins this morning.
you think I had something to do with this?
I need you to come in for questioning.
Why?
so you can run your tests?
take me in your lab and prove what?
I... This is your chance, Sully.
I know how it goes.
I walk in that lab...
I'm done.
gun!
easy, everybody.
put the gun down.
I can't.
it's too late.
I screwed up.
I screwed up bad.
let's talk about it. Talk?
talk...
I dug myself such a hole, you can't even get me out, Horatio.
Sully, were you stealing evidence?
no. Then who was?
nobody was supposed to get hurt. But they did.
they got killed, Sully, and that's on you.
come inside, Sully, please. It's too late.
I'm sorry. Sully, come inside
sorry, H.
have they released Wolfe yet?
no. Still waiting for the bacterial DNA results.
Sully say who Carmichael was?
he did not.
we're looking for another cop, someone Sully knew and trusted.
we are.
the officer that works here in the evidence locker.
what about him?
before he worked the evidence locker, Frank...
he worked the impound yard where most of the property was stolen.
right.
13, 14, 15 times he signed out for Carmichael.
and he was in the lab when the diamonds were stolen.
he gets around, Frank.
Yeah, that sounds good.
I like their food.
Hey.
get off of the phone, Olansky.
I'll call you back.
you know, during your time at the impound, you signed out multiple cars to an officer Carmichael- none of which were ever returned.
including the bomb car.
lot of people come in and out of impound, sir.
it's hard to keep the names and the faces straight.
that's fair enough.
but, uh, coincidentally, you were also at the evidence lockup the day the diamonds went missing.
and during that very same shift, Officer, you claim the security cameras went down and that you called Tech Services.
Yes, sir.
we checked the internal log and your extension.
you never made that call, Officer.
I misspoke, sir.
I went to Tech Services.
I thought it'd be faster.
you thought that'd be faster than a phone call?
officer Olansky, you shut those cameras off, didn't you?
no, sir.
okay. You did deal with Carmichael, though.
Yes, sir. And he did sign out those cars.
right, Officer?
Yes, sir.
including the bomb car.
here's the problem, Officer.
Carmichael has been dead for over two years.
two years.
so I'm gonna ask you again.
who are you dealing with?
who signed out the cars?
stop lying, Olansky, all right?
an assistant state attorney was killed in that car.
who was Carmichael?
somebody shut those cameras off to protect that man.
now, who was it?
officer, this is a murder one rap.
you don't give me his name, you take it yourself.
I want you to think about that.
I got your call, Horatio.
bacterial DNA was a match.
so we got our man.
as a matter of fact, we do, Rick.
why don't you have a seat?
what's going on?
we ran a bacteria sample from you against the profile from the diamonds.
you were a match.
what are you talking about?
you never swabbed me.
no, but you were holding that folder while you were interrogating me.
okay, so you got a bacterial DNA match.
you don't have my DNA.
we don't need it.
he's right, Rick. We don't need it.
with Olansky's testimony, you're going down.
or should we, uh...
should we call you Carmichael?
all of these years, Stetler, you were trying to pin something on one of us, you were the dirty one.
stealing evidence, the cars, drugs, diamonds.
and most importantly, conspiring to kill the state's attorney, Rick.
started with one car.
one stupid car.
Carmichael -- he takes a Porsche out of impound for a case.
Carmichael disappears.
nobody cares.
nobody notices.
$100, 000 car gone.
$100, 000?
that stuff just sits there in Asset Forfeiture.
goes forgotten.
so I made a trip to impound.
where you taking the vehicle, sir?
you're Officer Olansky, right?
Yes, sir.
you know, you failed your last drug test.
I was told I passed.
Oh, did I say your last?
I meant your next drug test.
Yeah, here's the deal.
I make sure that that doesn't happen, you get to keep your job, and all it costs is a dead banger's ride.
is that fair enough?
thank you.
there we go.
that's where you got the car you used for the bombing, right?
the diamonds...
...they were gonna be it.
you see, I just needed a couple more weeks, because I couldn't let all those years of work go to waste.
you planted those diamonds in Wolfe's apartment to buy time, and that's all.
20 years.
I gave my life for this.
and what do I got to show for it?
I got high blood pressure, I got two ex-wives, and I got a pension that ain't worth spit.
we all do.
that's the nature of the sacrifice.
cut the self-righteousness, Horatio.
you know better than anybody that this place chews you up, and what are you gonna get at the end, Horatio?
you're gonna get an exit interview, and you're gonna get a cheap watch.
so...
I stole from some thieves.
big deal.
Rebecca Nevins was one of us, Rick, and you had her killed.
this ain't me, guys. You know me.
get up.
get up.
Yeah.
you tried to pin all this on me?
you're going to prison, you son of a bitch.
I know.
I'm glad you got my back.
thank you.
it's quite a sight.
that view never gets old.
I wasn't talking about the view.
flattery will get you nowhere today.
I know it's gonna take me a while to earn back your trust.
you're right about that.
20 MINUTES EARLIER
Hey, I thought we were supposed to meet for coffee.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I-I got pulled away.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Uh, I'm downtown, about to step into court. Is everything okay?
Yeah, sure.
okay.
I'll talk to you in a bit.
okay.
what are you doing?
Calleigh, where did you come from?
why did you lie to me? - I didn't lie to you.
Yes, you did.
Calleigh, look, can we not do this now?
you drove right past me at PD.
you followed me here?
of course I did. You've been acting strange, and now you're lying to me.
what time can I get in to see Talbot?
Yeah, I'm not lying.
Nevins. Are you still working for the A. S.A?
I never stopped working for the state attorney's office when I came back to the lab.
but you both have offices, so why are you here?
does this have something to do with Walter? Are you building some sort of a case against him?
what? No! No.
well, then are you the reason why people are getting dragged into Rebecca's office?
you don't know what you're talking about.
then why don't you tell me the truth?
I'll explain later, okay? When there's time.
fine.
whatever works for you.
are you okay?
we're live now at the Asher Business Park in East Miami, where a suspected car bombing has rocked the city and the state now that word is out that this may have been an assassination.
Walter, EDRK on the Hummer?
Yeah, but you got to get it yourself. I'm looking for another patrolman.
Eric, you okay?
Yeah.
what happened?
supposed to meet Nevins here.
I... I found something big, H.
I was going to tell her.
I...
I got into a conversation with Calleigh.
if that hadn't happened, I-I would've been standing right next to her.
what did you find for Nevins?
the theft from the evidence lockup, it's...
there's more to it than the missing diamonds.
there's a half a million dollars in seized heroin that's
it's missing, it's gone.
you're sure about this? - Yeah.
I chased the paper on the Everson case from 2006.
I-I checked the evidence inventory...
it doesn't match up.
Eric, the Everson case of 2006 was Sully's case.
Yeah, he gave me some information yesterday.
this bomb could've been meant for you. Who else knows about this?
no one.
Eric, she was our friend.
let's not forget it.
Hey, partner.
missed a good day out on the Gulf Stream.
not your thing, I know.
I understand you spoke to Eric Delko yesterday.
he came to me, yeah.
wanted to talk to an old retired cop about an old case.
specifically, the Everson case.
Yeah, he said evidence has gone missing.
it has... Sully.
well, what do you want from me?
have you talked to anybody else about it?
of course not. Why?
somebody tried to assassinate Eric today.
they what?
clearly, Sully, he's getting close to something.
you think a cop did all this.
has to be somebody inside, doesn't it?
what do you want me to do?
need you to keep your ear to the ground, and if you hear anything, you let me know.
you bet. - Okay.
here you go.
Oh, thanks.
listen, if you, um...
ever need to talk...
thank you.
you know, Jesse, I keep finding all of this thin granular residue on the bomb site, and it's not dust.
there's more on the door panel; will you check it out?
Yeah, it's some sort of white residue.
you notice that smell?
Yeah. Smells like fuel.
at first, I thought it was the car, but I think it's from the bomb itself.
that means we're looking at ANFO.
ammonium nitrate fuel oil.
that would explain the extent of the damage.
well, the bomb clearly originated from that car.
all right, bye.
you know, we need to find the detonator.
will you make sure the separate sectors go back in different vehicles?
Thanks.
Hey, flatbed's on the way.
we'll clear the scene when it's ready for transport.
what do you know, Eric?
nothing more than you do, Natalia.
come on, you got to drop the act.
I mean, really, look at this. Nevins is dead!
this case has officially dropped in all of our laps, so you got to come clean about this, about everything.
come clean about what?
she deserves to know.
everyone deserves to know.
know what?
she had me wearing a wire.
a wire?! - You agreed to that?
evidence was going missing from the lab.
so you were spying on us?
everyone was a suspect on the stolen diamonds and the heroin.
okay? If it wasn't me, it was going to be someone that wasn't going to protect you.
you're a real hero, Delko. -Okay, okay, it's not as simple as it all seems.
and you-- you knew about this the whole time?
I'm sorry.
some team.
I was doing it to protect you guys!
you almost got yourself killed.
how's that protecting anyone?
Hey, Delko.
when you get a sec.
you know a lot about cars.
Yeah. - So from what I can see, every VIN on this car was stripped before the blast.
what do you think?
you know what, let's start with what's left of the suspension system.
Yeah, what are you thinking?
pass me that saw, please.
Thanks.
got a hydraulic pump.
or what's left of it, anyway.
this car had a hydraulic suspension.
well, you know what? A serial number can be just as useful as a VIN.
all right, let's start with a search of local auto shops.
a serial number could get us the owner of the bomb car.
all right.
all right, the hydraulics were installed on an '86 Cutlass.
hmm, that makes sense.
the size and shape of the wreckage could belong to a Cutlass.
well, here's the VIN number.
any details on the car?
vehicle records say that this car was shot up in a bank robbery in '08.
bank robbery? Who owns the car?
we do.
this car is supposed to be in our impound yard.
what?
Hey, let the phone ring.
sorry.
um, let's see. Sorry.
Yes, I think this is the car you're looking for.
a 1986 Cutlass.
uh, was seized by Major Crimes in 2008.
um, let's see... impounded here two weeks later.
even mentions the... - That's our bomb car.
who signed it out?
uh, that would be a Detective, uh, Steven Carmichael.
Carmichael pulled the vehicle for Undercover Task Force in March.
I need to use your computer. - Yeah, of course.
of course, just...
all right, let me ask you this. So you signed it out, he never brought it back.
and that didn't bother you?
well, no, I-I have heard nothing about this.
this is the first time. - Got something.
Carmichael pulled another car out a month earlier.
sounds like a pattern to me.
look, I just got out of the academy like two months ago, all right?
this is way before my time.
pull all requisitions signed by Carmichael.
of course.
Carmichael's in Narco.
his file's flagged "restricted
that'll make it tough to track him down.
let's start with his last case.
I need you to make copies of these for me.
Thanks. - Yes, sir.
Hey, easy.
have a seat, Tino.
what is this?
looking for a known associate of yours.
associate?
you mean cop.
Carmichael was investigating you, and he just disappeared.
well, I guess that's too bad, isn't it?
it's too bad, huh?
where is he?
screw you.
screw us? - Yeah.
does Carmichael still work for you?!
that undercover pig never worked for me.
he's responsible for almost $3 million in missing evidence.
you understand me? Cars, diamonds, narcotics.
that sounds just like my type of guy.
tino, where is he?
dropped him off somewhere between here and Key West.
when was that?
summer of '08 sometime.
so you're saying you killed him.
well, there ain't gonna be much left to find.
maybe the anchor he went down with.
H, that car didn't go missing till March, 2010.
tino, you're a liar.
why would I do that?
I'm sitting here doing life, chief.
honesty's my new policy, all right?
now, however, I just told you two that I 86'd a cop, and you're going on here about some car?
you guys are getting played, seems to me.
yo, C.O.
let's go, get out of here.
you guys are gettin' played.
what did you get from Garvez?
it turns out that the car used in the bombing was checked out of impound by a police officer named Carmichael.
used the name of a dead cop - we got a mess.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to start pulling files on Carmichael and I want you to keep me in the loop.
you don't do interviews without me.
got it.
I'm just saying, I've never stolen anything, ever.
I don't even know Delko all that well.
come to think of it, that's probably why he set his sights on me in the first place.
I don't think that's true, Walter.
these metal sprockets that Natalia recovered from the scene might actually be helpful.
you don't think they came from the vehicles?
no.
we collected hundreds of them.
I bet you they were part of the bomb.
well, take a look at this.
I think I just found the ignition device.
what?
what is that? Some kind of toy rocket engine?
Yeah, it makes sense.
motor uses a composite propellant.
the engine cap forces the gas and flames into the nozzle.
surefire way to ignite a hundred pounds of ANFO.
Yeah, but what ignites that thing?
what ignites that?
a cell phone.
the bomb was detonated remotely.
come to Daddy.
I found eight different kinds of sprockets in all this debris.
all right, Wolfe, follow me.
sprockets are gears used in motors.
if we can match the sprocket with the motor, like here...
these sprockets are all used in golf carts.
great, golf carts.
there's only a million of those in Miami.
we found hundreds of those sprockets, though.
but you know what, Walter?
I don't think we're looking for someone who owns a golf cart.
I think we're looking for someone who repairs golf carts.
drew Pollack, let me ask you something.
how is the golf cart business these days?
everybody over 50 in Miami has one, so business is good.
good. So you recognize these?
cause what I think, is that they're parts used in golf carts.
Yeah. so?
so, you used them to make bombs.
like the one you used today to kill Rebecca Nevins.
what? What are you talking about?
don't play dumb, Pollack. We know you built a bomb in 1999 that blew up a restaurant using the exact some signature as the one today.
toy rocket cell phone trigger.
that was a long time ago.
look, I... I cooperated with the state attorney.
the state attorney was, uh, Rebecca Nevins. She prosecuted the case, right?
Yeah, yeah, she's the reason I'm out.
that's right.
she made a deal with you.
you copped a plea.
but you still got ten years.
I don't know, that feels like revenge to me.
listen to me, Pollack, we know you're a rat.
and I'm going to give you a chance to help yourself.
how did you get the car out of the police impound, huh?
who are you working with?
I want my lawyer.
this is Dr. Tom Loman.
I am continuing the autopsy of Rebecca Nevins.
X-raying the remains with a digital fluoroscope.
victim suffered massive concussive injuries.
brain mass was pulverized and badly misshapen.
cardiac sac was desiccated.
heart muscle completely severed from arterial structure. Lungs bisected and torn.
liver shredded.
victim suffered dislocation of the spine at the seventh cervical juncture.
an appearance of shrapnel is noted throughout the body.
good God.
I will attempt to remove offending items with rubber tweezers, so as to preserve evidentiary value.
assist, please. Up.
thank you, sir.
I just pulled a GPS chip from Nevins' body.
okay, the GPS in her car was intact.
so this has to belong to the bomb car.
if the bomber used Nav, then a reverse journey will take us right back to him.
destination in one quarter mile.
we got backup. - Good.
so, are you still wearing it?
no. I'm not wearing the wire.
are you sure?
Calleigh, I stopped wearing it.
destination in 1, 000 feet.
cause I don't want to think about it.
think about what? What are you talking about?
were you wearing it when we were together?
destination in 500 feet.
were you wearing the wire when we were at home?
you have arrived at your destination.
Calleigh, listen to me.
I wasn't wearing the wire when we were home together.
Hey. That's Ryan's.
the car bomb started here?
no one really believes that Ryan did any of this, do they?
well, we know it was someone on the inside, so we do what we got to do.
Hey! Hey, careful with his stuff.
he's one of us. Hey!
I just don't feel good about doing any of this.
Yeah, me, neither.
I guess just look at it as not searching a suspect, but a way to exonerate Wolfe.
Yeah, well, Wolfe's here. Hey, Wolfe's here.
okay. Don't stop searching.
search.
I'll go talk to him.
the hell is going on here?!
stop. You can't go inside.
Oh, I can't go inside? This is my place. - Ryan.
I said stop! - It's okay. He can come in. It's okay.
those are my clubs. Hey! What is going on here? Is this some kind of joke?
what is IA doing here?
okay, look, the GPS coordinates from the car bomb led us back here.
where were you this morning?
you think I had something to do with the bomb?
are you serious? - I don't know.
are you kidding me? ! and what is he doing here?
Hey, I'm just trying to help. - Oh, you're just trying to help?
what's the matter? Your investigation with Walter hit a dead end, Eric?
speaking of which, make yourself at home, Walter, please. Don't get up.
all you guys can take a look around. Go through whatever you want.
you're going to find anything, so ha, ha, ha.
Eric, what are you doing?
those aren't mine.
of course, they're not. You stole them.
no, I mean I didn't put them there!
I did not put them there. I have no idea how they got there. Someone is trying to set me up.
do you see what's going on here?
you guys got to believe me. Someone's trying to set me up here. It's not me.
take him, please.
thanks a lot.
what happened? You have some old gambling debts to pay off, so you stole the diamonds?
you steal the car, the heroin, all that? - I haven't gambled in four years, Rick.
was Nevins getting too close?
you think I murdered Nevins? You better come out and say it, buddy.
well, the evidence that you trust so much is leading us all one way.
that's kind of how somebody wants it to look, isn't it?
Mr. Wolfe, back off right now.
Mr. Wolfe was the last person to see the diamonds before they went missing, Horatio.
I was in the evidence locker.
I was counting the diamonds.
I put them back in the bin.
then I signed out with an officer.
and that is by the book, Rick.
he was the last person in the chain of custody, and the diamonds were found at his house.
I was also the one who reported them missing.
Oh, and thanks to two of your CSIs, we also know the bomb car originated from Wolfe's house.
he's a prime suspect here.
this is an active investigation, my friend.
no. You're done.
I let you try it your way, and A. S.A. Nevins got killed.
so, cuff him now, please.
those are not necessary.
it's by the book, Horatio.
you guys seeing this?
they're dragging Wolfe away in cuffs.
this isn't right.
we-we got to do something.
well, I'm getting nothing here.
well, whoever framed Ryan killed Nevins.
Yeah, they also knew how to make themselves invisible. I mean, there's no prints, no usable trace, no DNA.
there's no human DNA.
what are you doing?
is this a new identification process?
brand-new. Just read about it in a journal.
well, what is it?
well, every time we touch an object--anything, from, um, a keyboard to a steering wheel...
to the diamonds? - Exactly. We leave behind a distinct bacterial signature that's consistent for up to two weeks.
so, you're saying we can tell who handled the diamonds by the bacteria they left behind?
exactly.
we each have a unique little set of creatures that are crawling on our skin.
kind of makes you want to lose your lunch, doesn't it?
this bacterial signature won't match 87% of the population.
well, then, we need to get elimination samples from everybody in the lab.
starting with Ryan.
Yeah, look, something about Nevins' connection to Pollack was bugging me, so I looked deeper into her case against him.
you're not going to believe what I found.
I didn't blow up that restaurant. Well, next time, don't use your own cell phone as the trigger, genius, and maybe I'll believe you.
Sully, better fix your lunch order before Parker hits the road.
sit tight, rocket man.
I'm not done with you.
Sully was the lead Detective.
he's the only one I told about my investigation.
if he's a dirty cop, he'd have every reason to want Nevins and me dead.
how do you want to handle it?
I'll talk to him.
taking a trip, Sully?
heading out to Government Cut. Tarpon are schooling.
drew Pollack, Sully. - Who?
drew Pollack, the bomber from '99.
Yeah, I worked that case ten years ago.
he killed Rebecca Nevins this morning.
you think I had something to do with this?
I need you to come in for questioning.
Why?
so you can run your tests?
take me in your lab and prove what?
this is your chance, Sully. - I know how it goes.
I walk in that lab...
I'm done.
gun!
easy, everybody.
put the gun down.
I can't.
it's too late.
I screwed up. I screwed up bad. - Let's talk about it.
talk...
I dug myself such a hole, you can't even get me out, Horatio.
Sully, were you stealing evidence?
no. Then who was?
nobody was supposed to get hurt. - But they did.
they got killed, Sully, and that's on you.
come inside, Sully, please.
Sully, come inside. - It's too late. I'm sorry.
sorry, H.
have they released Wolfe yet?
no. Still waiting for the bacterial DNA results.
Sully say who Carmichael was?
he did not.
we're looking for another cop, someone Sully knew and trusted.
we are.
the officer that works here in the evidence locker.
what about him?
before he worked the evidence locker, Frank...
he worked the impound yard.
where most of the property was stolen.
right.
13, 14, 15 times he signed out for Carmichael.
and he was in the lab when the diamonds were stolen.
he gets around, Frank.
Yeah, that sounds good. I like their food.
get off of the phone, Olansky.
I'll call you back.
you know, during your time at the impound, you signed out multiple cars to an officer Carmichael - none of which were ever returned.
including the bomb car.
lot of people come in and out of impound, sir.
it's hard to keep the names and the faces straight.
that's fair enough.
but, uh, coincidentally, you were also at the evidence lockup the day the diamonds went missing.
and during that very same shift, Officer, you claim the security cameras went down and that you called Tech Services.
Yes, sir.
we checked the internal log and your extension.
you never made that call, Officer.
I misspoke, sir.
I went to Tech Services. I thought it'd be faster.
you thought that'd be faster than a phone call?
officer Olansky, you shut those cameras off, didn't you?
no, sir.
okay. You did deal with Carmichael, though.
Yes, sir. - And he didsign out those cars.
right, Officer?
Yes, sir.
including the bomb car.
here's the problem, Officer.
Carmichael has been dead for over two years.
two years.
so I'm gonna ask you again.
who are you dealing with? Who signed out the cars?
stop lying, Olansky, all right?
an assistant state attorney was killed in that car.
who was Carmichael?
somebody shut those cameras off to protect that man.
now, who was it?
officer, this is a murder one rap.
you don't give me his name, you take it yourself.
I want you to think about that.
I got your call, Horatio.
bacterial DNA was a match.
so we got our man.
as a matter of fact, we do, Rick.
why don't you have a seat?
what's going on?
we ran a bacteria sample from you against the profile from the diamonds.
you were a match.
what are you talking about? You never swabbed me.
no, but you were holding that folder while you were interrogating me.
okay, so you got a bacterial DNA match.
you don't have my DNA.
we don't need it.
he's right, Rick. We don't need it.
with Olansky's testimony, you're going down.
or should we, uh...
should we call you Carmichael?
all of these years, Stetler, you were trying to pin something on one of us, you were the dirty one.
stealing evidence, the cars, drugs, diamonds.
and most importantly, conspiring to kill the state's attorney, Rick.
started with one car.
one stupid car.
Carmichael-- he takes a Porsche out of impound for a case.
Carmichael disappears.
nobody cares.
nobody notices.
$100, 000 car gone.
$100, 000?
that stuff just sits there in Asset Forfeiture.
goes forgotten.
so I made a trip to impound.
where you taking the vehicle, sir?
you're Officer Olansky, right?
Yes, sir.
you know, you failed your last drug test.
I was told I passed.
Oh, did I say your last? I meant your next drug test.
Yeah, here's the deal.
I make sure that that doesn't happen, you get to keep your job, and all it costs is a dead banger's ride.
is that fair enough?
thank you.
there we go.
that's where you got the car you used for the bombing, right?
the diamonds...
...they were gonna be it.
you see, I just needed a couple more weeks, because I couldn't let all those years of work go to waste.
you planted those diamonds in Wolfe's apartment to buy time, and that's all.
20 years.
I gave my life for this.
and what do I got to show for it?
I got high blood pressure, I got two ex-wives, and I got a pension that ain't worth spit.
we all do.
that's the nature of the sacrifice.
cut the self-righteousness, Horatio.
you know better than anybody better than anybody that this place chews you up, and what are you gonna get at the end, Horatio?
you're gonna get an exit interview, and you're gonna get a cheap watch.
so...
I stole from some thieves.
big deal.
Rebecca Nevins was one of us, Rick, and you had her killed.
this ain't me, guys. You know me.
get up.
get up.
Yeah.
you tried to pin all this on me?
you're going to prison, you son of a bitch.
I know.
I'm glad you got my back.
thank you.
it's quite a sight.
that view never gets old.
I wasn't talking about the view.
flattery will get you nowhere today.
I know it's gonna take me a while to earn back your trust.
you're right about that.
girl: Ring around the rosies Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes We all fall down!
girl: Ring around the rosies Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes We all fall down! Anything for Walter Simmons?
finally, that seminar membership I've been waiting for.
how many, uh, uh, nerd clubs are you a member of?
would you like to get beat up?
no.
Simmons, Simmons, Yes...
Simmons. Thank you. Thank you.
did I get any mail, Jen?
maybe.
Hey, Walter, what is this about?
I don't know.
I got one just like it, though.
wolfe: They're plastic transparencies.
looks like they've been cut up into pieces.
that's weird.
I have one for you, as well.
there's no postmark or return address on this envelope.
so these didn't come through the post office.
Hey, Jen, where'd you collect these?
pulled all of it from our box downstairs, just like I always do.
wolfe: Do you have any more like it in there?
uh, these are made out to Boa Vista and Cardoza.
girl: Ring around the rosies Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes We all fall down.
these here look like crosshairs from a rifle sight.
boa VISTA: Is this a real threat?
that woman definitely looks like a target.
this piece has the number 10 on it.
and this corner has 50.
what does that say?
Hamden...
court.
read it left to right, you got an address: "5010 Hamden Court.
I'm sending a unit out there right now.
girl: Ring around the rosies Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes We all fall down!
there she is.
Hiya, pal.
Hi.
now, sweetheart, you're okay now.
you're with us.
mommy fell down.
I KNOW THAT.
what's your name? Daria.
Daria, I want you to come with me.
and we're gonna wait till Daddy comes home, all right?
I just have that nagging feeling if we had opened the mail sooner, we could have prevented it.
I don't know, but the message has been sent loud and clear.
the killer's taunting us.
the kill shot is precise.
the killer must have used a hunting rifle, . 270, . 308 maybe.
that shot could have come from over a hundred yards out.
I'll go outside.
I'll widen the search area, okay?
this is unbelievable.
somebody out there thinks this is a damn game.
the gun position had to be close to straight on.
Yep.
Hey!
it's clear!
what the hell?
what is that, a . 308 casing?
looks like our shooter is long gone.
looks like our shooter was never here to take the shot.
what are you talking about? How else could he get it off?
this scope is WiFi enabled.
wifi? He killed this lady online?
the trigger, the left/right, the up and down, everything can be controlled remotely.
this person could be literally anywhere right now.
where is she?
Oh, God, baby, are you okay, huh?
daddy's here.
could you just...?
Hey, baby, I'll be back in just one minute, okay?
sir, you can't go inside!
my wife is in there!
officer, Officer? My wife is in there!
I'll take it from here. Thank you.
thank you.
Mr. Potter, your wife's body's been removed.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I, uh, I can't believe this is happening.
I just never thought... I mean, you hear threats...
threats? By who?
ex-spouses of my clients.
I'm a divorce lawyer.
I make people angry for a living.
people say things.
what did your wife do at Dade University?
nothing. She was a stay-at-home mom.
we found these.
they're all for $120, all from this month.
these are paychecks made out to my wife's maiden name, Janice Garber.
why is that? I don't know.
let's find out.
DELKO: H, I heard about the shooting.
Caine: Yes, they used an automated rifle, no prints, no trace, not registered.
sounds personal.
Yes. We received a message before the shooting.
DELKO: A message? What, through the mail?
Caine: They slipped itinto the morning mail, exactly.
why would they target us?
I think I just heard an "us" in there.
Yeah, that's right.
while I was gone, I realized this is where I want to be.
then I have you full-time.
I'm back, if you'll have me.
that's good news.
first order of business.
these checks are from Dade University.
let's figure out who this soccer mom really worked for, okay?
good to have you back.
woman: Janice Potter volunteered for a PhD psych research project I was conducting.
the university checks were compensation.
did she mention needing to hide this from her husband?
not that I can remember. Why?
because she used her maiden name to get paid.
everybody's got reasons for what they do.
what kind of research was this?
I was studying the moral compass of the human brain.
kind of a new take on the Milgram experiment on obedience
the one that explains Nazi Germany happened because of obedience to authority figures.
DELKO: It's a very controversial study, isn't it?
Yes.
so you got people like Janice who were lining up to be your guinea pigs?
woman: She thinks she's shocking people, but I'm studying her.
all right, you will ask the subject a series of questions, and if the subject answers incorrectly, you will administer an electric shock.
can you do that?
Yes, I can.
great. Let's begin.
my theory is that Nazi Germany didn't happen because people respond to authority.
simply put, the brain wants to be evil.
did she prove your theory right, she shock the subject?
let's just say I'm glad we weren't using actual voltage.
but I have her to thank for my success.
I'm moving on to a better institution because of it.
thank you for your time.
good luck. CAINE: Yeah.
a trained marksman knows his weapon inside and out, every part, every groove.
can't keep his hands off it.
did you find a print?
nothing.
well, this shooter didn't need to be a trained marksman to gun down a mother in front of her three-year-old.
he was a coward, and he just used a computer to do it. Well, can the computer at least help us track him down? That's what I'm hoping.
I'm gonna try to trace the trigger command back to its origin, and then hopefully get an I. P. address.
okay, it's just bouncing me all over cyberspace.
what about the . 308 casing?
what did IBIS find? Variation on a theme:
nothing.
excuse me. My name is Craig Potter.
it's important I see one of your CSIs.
and I think that this is something... Mr. Potter?
can I help you?
I got it.
I found this in our mailbox.
it's my address, but look who it's made out to.
made out to the CSIs.
what was my wife into?
I mean, does this have something to do with her?
what-what is going on?
you know, we just don't know yet.
I'm gonna go have this run, but your fingerprints are gonna be all over it. I didn't kill my wife.
I was in court all morning-- call Judge Hillridge.
Hey, Natalia, you know how all the envelopes delivered this morning were not postmarked?
no, they were all hand-delivered.
this was, too. No, no, this one wasn't.
this one was actually stamped by the post office.
I don't think the post office put that there;
this is one of those augmented reality tags.
what is an augmented reality tag?
this marking... Mm-hmm?
...it acts as a bar code.
you hold it up to your Web camera, and certain Web sites recognize it and put all kinds of fancy 3-D graphics on the computer screen.
magazines use it as P. R. gimmicks.
so could this be another message for us?
wolfe: Well, let's find out.
the message is:
we got to stop another murder.
but this pool could be anywhere.
boa VISTA: Okay, try clicking on it.
wolfe: No. It's nothing.
Yeah, but it moved. It moved. Did you see that? It shifted.
so maybe you can shift the perspective.
see if you can spin it.
Ryan, that's Dade University Bell Tower.
that's the south side of the campus, where the faculty pool is.
what are you doing here?
I got the call out.
that way! That way!
this is Wolfe! I need an ambulance to Dade University faculty pool!
you got him?
Yeah, go, go!
CPR! Get started! Come on!
breathe.
come on, breathe!
porter 2: Ken, I'm here at the scene awaiting the arrival of Horatio Caine.
well, there are rumors that police knew and were warned.
we have reports that there's a serial killer loose in Miami...
we want to find out as soon as he gets here. Lieutenant!
he's here now. Lieutenant! Lieutenant Caine!
is there a serial killer on the loose in Miami?
is it true that police were warned about both of today's murders before they happened? Hasn't been determined yet.
please do your job responsibly, so I can do mine. Lieutenant Caine, is there a serial killer on the loose in Miami? Have a great day.
lieutenant! Lieutenant!
H, we got here too late. It was planned that way, Eric.
how did the press get it? I don't know, not from us.
maybe the killer; he wanted some attention.
Caine: Okay, Dr. Loman.
C. O.D. was drowning.
but he also has bruises and contusions to his scalp.
what about the fingernails?
torn and bloody.
Caine: So maybe, gentlemen, he was in a fight, and they held him underwater.
I have something.
looks like some sort of... blue fabric.
DELKO: Yep.
I think I know what he was fighting.
our victim is a professor in the psych department, gentlemen.
didn't our soccer mom volunteer in a psych department?
Yeah. Yeah, but where's the message for us on this one?
why don't we open this?
there's our message.
fleur-de-lis on fire.
the paint is sticky, H.
let's find out why our guy in the pool was targeted.
I said after Virginia Tech we should be allowed to carry guns.
let's not overreact; the police are handling this.
lieutenant,
I didn't want to scare the others, but, uh...
I think Melissa Walls killed Janice Potter and Dr. Brusatti.
Caine: Dr. Madsen, why do you think she did it?
about a week ago,
Janice came to my office and accused Melissa of scientific misconduct.
misconduct?
she caught Melissa doctoring the results of her study.
increase the voltage.
I want to stop.
the experiment requires you to continue.
you know you want to do this.
come on, let's go.
it's hurting him.
and you're hurting my thesis.
Ugh, I can't do this anymore.
see, I reviewed Melissa's findings.
she did doctor her studies.
she manipulated the data to fit her theory.
so we had no choice but to kick her out of the program.
Melissa: I have her to thank for my success.
I'm moving on to a better institution because of it.
you cheated, Melissa.
no, you fired me.
what sort of message would we be sending the other students if there were no consequences to your actions?
Melissa: I can't believe this.
you're just gonna ruin my career?
we'll speak on your behalf.
none of this will have to come to light.
other institutions will have you.
am I just gonna pluck another thesis out of thin air?
new question, new data?
for six years, I did all the work that you didn't want to do.
I slaved for you.
for what?
so that you three could take away everything I've ever worked for?
no. No, I don't think so.
where is she now?
she packed up her office this morning.
thank you.
Hello?
Melissa Walls, Lieutenant Caine.
I told you people I don't know anything about Janice Potter's murder.
Melissa, I need your help with the Dr. Brusatti case.
you think I'm a suspect.
I'm not stupid. Hello, PhD here.
Yes, well, from what I understand, you didn't achieve distinction, and that you cheated.
what, like no one ever cheats in academia?
one-third of researchers admit to cooking data.
all the greats did it.
Ptolemy, Isaac Newton, Washington Carver.
did you or did you not kill Janice Potter and Dr. Brusatti?
is that your theory?
it is my theory.
you have no hard evidence.
maybe I should accuse you of cheating.
okay, why don't you come in and do it in person?
no. You're so certain, come and find me.
I will.
DUQUESNE: Until we find Melissa, we think it's best if both of you remain under our protection.
of course.
thank you. I'm just an adjunct professor.
I'm not tenured like Stephen and Neal.
I didn't have any power to sway the committee, and Melissa knows that.
both of you were on her PhD committee, so what we're afraid of is that one of you could be next.
professor: I was Melissa's advisor.
I didn't want to see her getting kicked out of the program.
that was their idea. It was a unanimous decision, Bob.
boa VISTA: Well, does this symbol
does this mean anything to either of you?
fleur-de-lis. Beyond that, no.
Melissa Walls is not a threat. I don't need a bodyguard.
take their protection, Bob.
I'll look out for myself.
officer: I checked the whole apartment.
it's clear.
I knew they were putting uniforms outside, but I didn't know you were going to be inside the house.
Yeah. It's just as easy for somebody to get to you inside.
that's why I'm here.
true.
you know, those aren't from, uh, just one woman.
okay. No.
what I meant was that they're not from a date.
they're from a, uh...
departmental party that I hosted Thursday night. Got it.
got it. Got it. I'm just gonna keep looking around, if you don't mind.
for evidence.
uh... not at all.
um... I'd like to take a shower.
is that okay?
permission granted.
thank you, Officer.
no. Call me Natalia.
Thanks.
SIMMONS: Natalia, I-I found a fleur-de-lis.
Yeah, it's a logo for some cologne called Ahtash.
A-H-T-A-S-H. Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah, CSI Boa Vista.
I need an ambulance to 210 Springer Streetnow! Hurry!
Horatio, he's got ALBUM AVAILABLthird-degree burns on his hands, face and neck.
Natalia, you saved his life.
the fleur-de-lis painted on the pool cover
it's the same as the one painted on this bottle of cologne.
so obviously, somebody got in here and tampered with that before we got here.
Yeah. I'm gonna take it back to the lab, do a flame test, see what incendiary agent was used.
let's do it here, okay? All right.
purple means potassium.
which combusts when it makes contact with water.
so Madsen got out of the shower, and he was still wet.
sprayed on when he got out of the shower.
someone managed to get their hands on this when he wasn't looking.
well, he did say that they threw a party for the department here last night.
Caine: Natalia, didn't you say that on the guest list was Melissa Walls, our primary suspect?
well, the fleur-de-lis was the last message, so are we missing the next message?
DELKO: Maybe not.
mass pandemics, "such as the bubonic plague, "reify the value of human life "and in turn, the societal ramifications for crimes against humanity, as well.
can I see it?
the quote is from an article by Bob Starling.
I'm next, aren't I? Tell me.
we don't know that.
don't protect me from the truth.
I deserve to know.
do you recognize this?
Yeah, of course I do.
it's an article from a journal I published last year: "Why Civic Discord is
logical When Facing Mass Pandemic.
maybe you've read it.
I couldn't put it down.
why is this relevant?
well, a quote from this article was left for us at Professor Madsen's home.
left for you? Like a clue?
what is this, Sherlock Holmes?
who does such things?
right now, all the victims are tied to your grad student, Melissa Walls.
here we go again.
CARDOZA: Look, these are your words left at the crime scene.
we believe Melissa is behind this.
when's the last time you saw her?
I see her all the time.
she was in my office just yesterday.
Melissa, I don't have that kind of sway.
I don't have tenure yet.
but everybody listens to you.
you're my advisor, my mentor. Can't you fight for me?
look, you have to understand.
falsifying your data was a serious breech.
Oh, come on. Everybody does it.
Yeah, well, not everybody gets caught!
CARDOZA: You know if she touched anything when she was in there?
I left her alone for a few minutes when I talked to the department secretary.
all right, we're gonna have to process everything that's in your office.
TRIPP: And you and I are gonna spend some quality time together, till we get this thing figured out.
I don't need protection.
I have a lecture this afternoon.
it'll be a... I'll be in a room full of students.
I guess I'll be auditing that class.
we've been looking for you, Ms. Walls.
you weren't looking hard enough.
I wasn't hiding.
prime suspect in a double murder and an attempt at a third.
you still think I'm you're killer.
you had motive and opportunity.
DELKO: Innocent people are usually cooperative.
they'll do anything to get to the truth and clear their name.
you said, "usually," implying there's a percentage of innocent people who aren't cooperative, am I right?
we need your last 24 hours.
my day planner.
have at it.
we'll take it, and we want you for the murders of Janice Potter and Neal Brusatti.
you have 48 hours to file charges.
if you can't, I'm free.
we'll take our chances.
even if I am guilty, taking me into custody won't prevent any murders that are already set in motion.
we grabbed Melissa Walls' day planner.
Hey, so when you guys found the fleur-de-lis, the spray paint-- it was tacky, right?
Yeah, tacky and non-transferable.
right. Okay.
well, I brought out the same acrylic aerosol paint, the same polyethylene sheeting, to recreate the exact same conditions.
see how long it takes for the paint to become tacky.
exactly. Taking into account the difference in sun position, we should be able to approximate when our killer painted the fleur-de-lis.
all right, hit it.
hit it.
tacky with no transfer.
46 minutes, and we found the symbol at 2: 15.
okay. 46.
which means our killer painted the fleur-de-lis at approximately 1: 30.
Yeah, well...
according to this,
Melissa Walls has a lot of explaining to do.
that's good work, man.
Yeah, you put a lot into this day planner.
appointments, names, numbers.
every random thought or idea.
I don't like to forget things.
apparently, you forgot where you were between 1: 00 and 2: 00 today.
I had a pilates class at this time.
we're gonna need confirmation on that.
I have it.
the names of nine people from class.
they'll be more than happy to set you straight.
I also have an affidavit from the instructor which states that I attended class from beginning to end, in case you doubt me.
why didn't we get this before? You believed I was guilty.
I simply allowed that belief to continue.
DELKO: You wanted us to believe that you were guilty? No.
I was completely neutral.
you had a single theory.
all your perceptions in this case were shaped to support that theory.
why would you allow this to happen?
it's part of my new thesis.
first impressions, false perceptions.
because of it, I just got accepted to Eastern Florida University.
the mind of an investigator needs an answer, so it seizes on a suspect, then alters perceptions so that all evidence fits that single idea.
Caine: On the guest list was Melissa Walls, our primary suspect.
it's called belief perseverance.
we followed actual evidence.
you followed me, to the detriment of all other viable suspects.
like the D. C. Sniper case.
someone calls in, reports seeing a white van, and cops spend all of their time looking for it while more people die.
DELKO: You know, your little experiment puts other peoples' lives in danger?
you're doing that.
I'm just an impartial observer.
Caine: Not if somebody else dies.
if you ask me, the girl did it. She's jerking your chain.
DUQUESNE: This is everything from Starling's office.
CARDOZA: Is Tripp still with Starling?
cause he could be next. Yeah. He's watching him like a hawk.
CARDOZA: Look, check out these articles he wrote.
global Plague Hysteria," "Fear and the Flu.
this is interesting.
it's an application for tenure. It's been denied.
it's the Holy Grail of academia.
it sure is. It buys you academic freedom, job security.
and professors work years to get it.
check out the names on the committee.
Neal Brusatti, Stephen Madsen. Well, those are two of our victims.
okay, what if the person we're protecting is actually our killer?
I'm calling Tripp.
went straight to voice mail.
call patrol. Get a car out there.
Hey, guys, these look familiar to you?
DARIA: Ring around the rosies Pocket full of posies Ashes, ashes We all fall down.
those are the stamps from our letters.
I'm sure the postal service sells millions of those.
we're gonna need more than that to connect Starling to the murders.
no. Stamps have fingerprints.
the postal service puts secret watermarks on stamps to prevent counterfeiting.
each sheet has its own specific watermark.
all you got to do...
is put a glycerin-based liquid on it.
raises the watermark.
CARDOZA: Those watermarks are a match.
Starling sent us these letters.
Shakespeare is a progenitor of 20th-century analysis.
without Shakespeare, there is no Freud.
food for thought. All right, go. Get out of here.
lieutenant?
what's this about?
we matched some stamps from your office to mail sent to my CSIs.
stamps? You matched stamps?
Caine: I believe that you murdered Brusatti, and tried to kill Madsen because they denied you tenure.
when Melissa Walls' research went sour, you were found responsible.
Janice Potter dropped those fake results in your lap, and made you look bad.
she became your first target.
Shakespeare shows us in Hamlet, revenge delayed invites madness.
my mind is clear.
put your hands behind your back.
I need to ask you why you sent those letters.
Caine: "They all fall down.
Walter. Hey...
Hey! Hey!
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
breathe. Breathe.
you hear me?
Calleigh, listen, please.
: somebody!
somebody help! Help!
open your eyes.
where are you?
What...?
let me see your hands, son. Easy. Easy.
don't come any closer. Please.
what is going on, Jason?
Jason? What is going on?
how... How do you know my name?
you called it in.
no, I didn't! - You called 911 to report a murder.
you said it was your own murder, and that we would find your body here.
easy, Jason. - I just found it. I just found it.
I just found it.
Yeah, there's a dead body here.
it ain't Jason Reger.
Jason, who is that?
who is that man? - I - I pushed him.
I pushed him, but I thought it was me.
so who is it, Jason? Who is that man? - I don't know.
how do you know he was buried here, then?
I don't know.
I pushed him, but it was me, but...
maybe it was just a dream.
Jason, the dream is over.
open your eyes.
take that shirt off.
here you go.
sleeping Beauty still think he's trapped in a dream?
Yeah.
did you check him for the... wacky tobaccee?
I don't do drugs. Not anymore.
Oh, yeah? Well, how come you can't remember driving up here, buddy?
found your car up the road, running.
kind of hard to dream and drive, isn't it?
lieutenant Caine?
Hey. Hand me that trowel, thanks.
Yes, Dr. Loman? - I like to start my excavation at the feet, get an outline of the body first.
but this time, I can't find them.
and why is that?
because he doesn't have a body.
Hey, Walter? Come here, Jason.
so, where is the rest of him?
what do you mean?
I - I don't know what's happening.
a man was murdered. You led us out here. Now lead us to the body.
this isn't the only dream I remember.
I only remember two other dreams.
in one dream, I remember just standing on a dock.
there was a sign, and I had a wooden trunk.
STONEGILL LANDING
is that the sign?
maybe. - Hey, man, I'm gonna need more than a maybe.
this is the fifth dock we've been to.
no, it was just like this. It was just like this.
I was standing here...
what did you do with the trunk? - I threw it in.
I remember another dream.
I was running.
Hey, man.
you all right?
Hey.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
what happened was, you were telling me about your other dream.
then you just took off.
you said you were running through a maze of trash.
does this look like that place?
Jason, is this...?
I came to that.
you came to the incinerator? Oh, boy.
heads up. Excuse me. Special delivery.
you have some hands for me Walter.
I was a little late, so they got extra crispy.
straight from the incinerator to you.
I'm just hoping they solve the puzzle of how our John Doe died.
hand me fabric softener. It's over there, lower left, please.
you already knew where the victim's head was buried.
the rest of his body was in this trunk, except for the hands.
those, Walter took out of the incinerator.
you want to know why I know?
you've already been very helpful, Jason, but it might help us find the killer.
I've just been... I was getting my life back together, you know.
I've - I've been clean for a year. Right?
so, and I've even seen some professionals.
okay, so how - how about you tell me?'Cause I don't know.
well, we have no ID still on the body, but the hair that we found on you matches our victim.
I don't understand. - It means you had contact with him.
well, when - when you found me, I was digging him up, and - and I...
it could have gotten on me when I was digging him up.
Yeah, you say digging, I say burying.
what is that supposed to mean? - It means that we're just discussing the evidence.
Yeah, and the evidence says that he did it. - You said I called 911.
why would I call 911 if I killed him?
cause I think you're building a dream defense.
I went to sleep, Your Honor, and the next thing I know, "I killed a man, but I can't possibly be held responsible - 'cause I thought I was dreaming." - Hey.
it's not going to work. Come on.
you're right.
I better work on my defense. I want a lawyer.
Natalia, I need to talk to you outside. - Okay.
you sit tight, Jason.
what the hell was that? We agreed we weren't going to push him yet.
you know what, the only reason that Jason knows what he did is because he did it.
look, not necessarily, okay? He might have overheard someone, remembered it as a dream.
there's merit to cases like this. - This is such defense attorney psychobabble.
do you... do you know when my ex was on trial for attacking me, he used the same dream state defense, and believe me, he was wide awake.
look, I'm not saying you're wrong, Natalia.
okay? But right now we still don't know what happened, and Jason won't even talk to us.
so we find out the old-fashioned way.
Hey, Travers!
this is the hair that we found on our suspect.
I was just wondering if you're gonna be able to tell me what part of the body it's from.
uh, not specifically.
all I can do is determine whether it's head or body.
perfect. That is all I need, actually. Will you do me a favor?
will you jump that to the top of your pile for me, please?
I'm really in a rush.
thank you, sir. Thank you.
so no C.O.D. yet?
no exterior wounds, tox came back negative, and his internals are a very healthy 40ish, like he dropped dead for no reason.
so we looking at natural causes?
nothing natural about a body in four pieces.
someone wanted him dead.
dismemberment was post, but this is interesting.
they're hesitation wounds.
so it looks like our killer was remorseful.
so should I grab a load of laundry, Doc?
I use it to rehydrate fingerprints.
you need an I.D. and I don't want you to go away empty-handed.
99. 32% match - And Peter, remember to lock the doors. - Okay.
I'm sorry, gentlemen, we're closing early today.
do I look like one of your customers?
Mrs. Garrett, Sergeant Tripp.
I notified you about your husband's death.
of course, Sergeant.
I was just trying to close the clinic for a few days to make arrangements for Brandon.
we're sorry for your loss, ma'am.
is it possible that your husband was having problems with someone?
no, everyone liked Brandon.
can we, uh, take a look at his office?
well, he doesn't keep one here anymore.
well, this was listed as his business.
Peter, could you give us a moment, please?
sure.
I'm sorry. I should have told you this on the phone.
Brandon and I, we were getting a divorce.
he has his own place now.
when was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday.
we talked all the time.
we wanted to do this without a lawyer.
are you OCD? You keep touching that thing when you say his name.
honoring the dead.
I'm very spiritual.
something Brandon and I didn't see eye to eye on.
like dividing up the business.
that wasn't an issue with us.
the med spa is mine. - Well, that's certainly true now.
let me get Brandon's address for you. - Thank you.
looks like Brandon got the short end of the stick in the divorce.
there's no furniture up there.
it looks like you're buying me lunch. I got first evidence.
some scratches here. - We're not sure that this is evidence yet, are we?
well, they start from the bathroom, and go all the way to the front door.
if you ask me, they look to be about the same size as the trunk that our body was found in.
Hey, Eric, come here and take a look at this.
maybe I owe you lunch. Looks like you found our primary crime scene.
Yeah.
check the plastic fish in the drain.
that's a magic fish.
it's this, uh, psychic trick.
it's supposed to read your romantic mood.
really just reacts to the sweat in your hand.
that's pretty cool.
huh, I guess that means you're attracted to an Elena Manus?
it's not supposed to have a name on it. You know what?
I bet that that's a business card. Maybe Elena Manus is a psychic.
think she already knows we're coming?
no, Mr. Garrett isn't a client of mine. I've never seen him before.
that means your calling card came from our killer.
so, you have any idea who you gave these to?
Oh, no, I pass those out like candy.
maybe you should ask Brandon's spirit who killed him.
well, now...that would be something.
uh, I'm not that kind of psychic.
I'm more of a healer.
I manipulate the energies in and around you to bring balance.
in fact, Detective Wolfe, if you don't mind...
I'm just gonna touch you right here.
see, your aura is composed of colors.
hmm. Right here it's green. Green means finances.
are you having some money issues?
well, sometimes I have, you know, to go to the ATM.
Yeah, I'm not surprised, because it's faded right here.
something is keeping you from your full prosperity.
you know what? Just rub some oil there.
it'll free up your aura.
I'll bet you'll come into some money real soon.
little oil. Oh...
look at that. - Yeah, look at that.
so if I were to...
if I were to have touched the owner of that like I just did with Detective Wolfe, maybe I could read some residual energy.
well, why not? Let's give it a shot.
what do you say?
sure. - Okay.
no, I shouldn't have done that.
Why? - The owner's a client.
he carries that fish with him everywhere.
what's his name? - You don't understand. His aura's very dark.
I'm not surprised he's killed someone.
if he knows I gave you his name...
we would never do that.
his name's Jason Reger.
Jason, you never mentioned that you go and see a psychic.
I didn't think it mattered.
it doesn't, except we found a magic red plastic fish at the crime scene.
what fish? What is this? - Red magic plastic fish. You got one of those?
Yes. - What's going on?
what are you...? - Can I see it?
what is this?
I don't under... What's going on here?
it must have fallen out.
well, does the fish have any identifying characteristics?
that way, we can eliminate you from the list of people who may have been the murderer.
there's a tear on the back fin.
like that? - That's it.
is that it? - Yeah, uh, let me ask a question.
how many toy fish are out there missing fins?
because I just don't think your ASA's gonna accept it as evidence.
I do think they're gonna accept this.
remember this hair that we found on your body that belonged to the victim that you said was from the head of the victim?
this is actually androgenic, which means it's from the body, and not from the scalp.
so that means that you handled the victim's body. - No, no, no. No, no, you know that my client doesn't recall any of this.
Yeah, I can spell this out for him, though.
after you killed him, you dismembered his body - Hold on a second, - And that's how the hair transferred onto you.
and as you were cleaning up all of the blood in the bathroom, your little fish fell inside the tub.
excuse me! You don't even have a murder weapon at this point!
because how else would you know how all the body parts got dumped? Well, we found...
what are you talk...?! Hello?!
this is inadmissible! All this is inadmissible!
just shut up, please! Shut up!
please?
I - I was in his home. I don't know why.
maybe I did kill him.
is that a confession, Jason? - No. You know what?
not it is not. It's not. - Yes.
no, it is not. And unless you guys are gonna charge my client, we're done.
excuse me.
that's it. Don't say another word.
let's go. Come on, Jason.
we're done here. Come on.
Horatio, FYI, I scooped our victim's stomach.
he hadn't ingested anything.
but the headlines are petechial hemorrhages on his lungs.
it happens when you stop breathing so suddenly the lungs strain against the rib cage.
what causes this?
I'll let you know when I do. - Thank you, Doctor.
so I pulled Stacy's financials, like you asked.
turns out she's loaded.
she develops those weird treatments women are into.
check out her product line.
she's got everything from algae lip plumper to snail venom derma abrasions.
her lab must be a freak show.
what about her financials?
Oh, right. Last week, she withdrew $50, 000 cash.
sounds like hit man money, you ask me.
what about Jason's account?
I checked his account, and no deposits yet.
matter of fact, he's hemorrhaging cash.
okay, so maybe we need to get a receipt from Stacy.
Mrs. Garrett?
you hear that?
Oh, boy.
Whoa! Hey, hey! Hey, how'd you even get in here?!
are you kidding me? You didn't lock the door, did you?- Miami-Dade Police.
damn it, Peter, get these off of me.
honoring the dead, Mrs. Garrett?
I'm not doing anything wrong.
Brandon and I were over. I moved on.
50k to a hit man'll sure help you do that.
hit man? What are you talking about?
a very large, very recent withdrawal.
this isn't for a hit man.
I paid my psychic. - Is your psychic's name Elena Manus?
what does a psychic do for $50, 000?
helps me get pregnant.
I asked her to make me a fertility charm.
she said it was difficult to do.
you don't believe me? Well, guess what, it worked.
I'm sorry. You're pregnant?
four weeks. Elena can do anything.
so, what, you just...
you did this without telling me?
it's called life with Stacy, Peter.
thanks for stopping by. We done?
for now.
that's when she said I was going to make a lot of money.
and I said, "Honey, where were you three years ago?"
you know, you got something oily on your forehead.
well, we know we can't trust Elena Manus, either.
I mean, she didn't even tell us that Stacy Garrett was a client.
see, I think that everybody at this point is lying.
Yes, but Elena is the key, because Jason and the victim's wife were her clients.
I've been going through fraud cases, and psychics will sometimes front for drugs or prostitution.
why not contract for murder?
you think Elena might be a hit woman?
she may be the middleman.
so let's ask her.
how do you mean? - Not as a cop. Let's ask her as a client.
do you want to go undercover?
I'm just saying that she hasn't met me yet.
I think that's a good idea.
nice going.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Alcala.
no, that's okay. I was just glad you could get me in at the last minute.
of course.
now, I like to...
record my sessions... for reference only.
if you don't mind?
hmm. That's funny. So do we.
Oh, I'm good. I'm good with that.
so you said on the phone you were having issues in your marriage.
Yes, uh, that's... that's actually why I'm here.
the egg thing, I didn't get...
why you wanted me to carry the egg around all day with me today.
I know. It seems kind of silly, doesn't it?
but you can understand an egg is a brand-new thing.
it's unpolluted.
and because of that, it can draw in any corrupting influences from our energy fields.
so I asked you to hold it, keep it with you, so I can see what we're dealing with.
um, would you mind if I...?
you have a... you have a hearing aid?
you seem so young to be wearing one.
it's new. And I'm just getting used to it.
it's... a long story. - Of course.
I have to ask...are you the only one who has touched this?
Yes. - I ask because, if we find something inside,
I need you to trust me. Can you do that?
Oh. What does that mean?
that tells me someone is hurting you, Natalia.
is it your husband?
all... all this happened, um, the last time that he hit me.
I'm so sorry. - I just want him out of my life.
I just... I... I want him out of my life forever.
and he will be.
but I see in your aura there's a part of you that hasn't let go of him yet.
and you need to be able to do that in order to move on. Understand?
so...
I'm just going to realign your aura so that you'll be able to take control of your life again, all right?
I just need you to lean forward and breathe.
that's great. Just breathe.
and after this, your husband will never be able to hurt you again.
close your eyes.
red will become blue.
blue will become yellow.
yellow will become green.
red will become blue.
blue will become yellow.
yellow will become green.
red will become blue.
blue will become yellow.
yellow will become green.
red will become... - How long has she been in there?
20 minutes. Elena's healing her aura.
what is that?
blue will become yellow.
yellow will become green.
just got it again... some sort of rustling noise.
is she keying the Mic? - Natalia, hey.
give us some sort of sign that you're okay. Cough or do anything.
blue will become yellow.
I don't like this. Get her out of there.
Natalia's cover car is gone. It's gone.
she put her chanting on a loop. I - I didn't hear the switch-over.
we got ten minutes to catch up to them.
GPS.
open your eyes.
Hello?
her backup weapon is missing.
hello.
no, no, no.
no, no, no.
don't you come closer. Don't you come. Do not come closer to me.
do you hear me?
Natalia? - You're not going to hurt me again.
no.
Natalia? - Stop!
do you hear me? You are not going to hurt me.
stay away from me. Get away from me.
Natalia. - Stay away from me!
listen to me. Get away from me!
do you hear me? - Natalia!
get away from me!
do you hear me?!
stop!
No!
stop. No! No! - Natalia!
it's us, it's us, Natalia. Natalia, no!
it's us.
sweetie, can you open your eyes?
can you open your eyes?
you're okay. You're in the hospital. It's okay.
what... what the hell? What happened?
you don't remember anything?
no, I do. I do. I - I, um...
I - I remember I - I went to undercover to Elena's.
and then, um...and then I came back to the lab.
no, I couldn't, because my ex-husband Nick was there.
what happened?
Elena figured out you were a cop and that your earpiece was a wire.
somehow, she was able to drug you.
we found traces of a hallucinogen in your system.
it's made from a local weed called datura.
a hallucinogen that, uh, makes you very suggestible.
basically, she hypnotized you.
what did... what did she have me do?
she had you drive out to the old Wheeler Mill, and, um...
that's where Horatio and I found you.
she knew that we were on to her, and she was hoping we'd be so concerned with finding you, - she'd be able to get out of town. - This is what happened to Jason.
this is exactly what happened to...I apologize. I'm so sorry.
I didn't believe you. I... I just...
I thought he was making it all up, so I...I figured there's no way - It's okay.
that this could actually happen to somebody, it's okay.
but it does. - Just take it easy.
get to him. Tell him right away. This is really scary.
it's okay. We're going to tell him right now.
we just did normal stuff in our sessions, so...
now, look, if we can prove that you were drugged, it can mean the difference between freedom and prison for you.
it's okay, Jason. Answer their questions. They're just trying to help you.
please.
we'd come in here, you know.
I sit here. She sits there.
we talk.
you know, then she'd do her aura thing.
did she make you any tea?
she do anything with the gemstones or the egg?
she... she did something different yesterday.
she told me to lean over the candle, breathe it in.
take deep breaths. Close your eyes.
take deep breaths. That's right.
purify my body.
there's something baked into this.
a datura seed pod.
that's how she drugged you.
did I kill him?
Jason... - Just shut up. Shut up.
did I?
to be honest with you, Jason, we don't know that yet.
Hey, look, man, she was a con artist.
you weren't the only victim. - You mean idiot, right?
no. Go ahead. - No, you can say it.
I'm an idiot, right?
I came to her because the last time I saw my father,
I was so high I told him to drop dead and, you know...
a week later, he did, and she told me that...
I needed her to...to purify my aura, to cleanse myself, and I believed her because I wanted to.
I believed her because I was walking around with so much grief that I'd have tried anything to make it go away.
to escape your old life, Jason, you need to cut out what's holding you back.
right? Remove its head, its hands, so it can no longer touch you.
bury those evil parts.
bury them where I told you.
now...
open your eyes.
I don't think you had a choice.
lieutenant.
you got to see this.
excuse me, gentlemen.
we found it in a hidden drawer.
thank you. - Sorry, Jason.
sir?
$500 bundles.
that's what I pay her twice a week.
want me to get this stuff back to the lab? - No. Here's what I want to do.
let's restage the whole scene.
Elena's not somebody who's gonna leave town without the money.
hands on your head! Hands on your head!
take the money you found. You can let me go; No one will know.
Bribery's not gonna help you, Elena.
Oh, for God's sakes.
lieutenant.
will you listen to me?
I didn't mean to kill him. I didn't know what I was doing.
but you did kill him. - I don't know what happened.
he wasn't supposed to die; it was all fake.
what was fake? - All of it.
Stacy asked me to mess with his aura so he'd croak.
she actually believes in this crap. Whoa, whoa.
so you're saying you don't? - No.
not until yesterday. I was just making it up as I went along, trying to take this stupid woman's money.
because we're married, he gets half my company.
I want him dead, Elena.
Stacy, what you're asking is difficult.
and very expensive to do.
but I believe in you, Elena.
okay. Set up a meeting at his house.
so what you're saying is that you committed murder to cover fraud.
don't you see? I'm not a fraud. It's all real.
I pulled the energy from his body without ever touching him.
so could we just get this over with? Please?
now, just relax.
all I'm gonna be doing is realigning your energies. Okay?
I can't feel my hands. What's wrong with my arms?
is this supposed to be happening?
what have you done to me?!
so then you used Jason to dispose of Brandon.
I just couldn't touch that body.
get her out of here.
don't you see? It's all real!
okay.
well, we know that didn't happen.
think she's conning us?
it's either that, Walter, or somebody's conning her.
I'm not even sure why we're still discussing this.
Elena already confessed, right?
confessed to what?
ripping the energy out of Brandon's body?
well, we know that it's not true, but she really believes that it is.
I say we go after the wife.
we have her for conspiracy. She asked Elena to kill Brandon.
as much as it kills me to agree with Walter, we can't move on the wife. All she did was pay Elena to cast a spell.
well, Horatio thinks we should just look at the evidence, because Elena gave us the missing piece.
I guess this is where I come in.
Tom, thanks for coming up.
the psychic gave us the victim's symptoms before he died.
interesting.
what are they?
he was dizzy and disoriented. - He was acting like he couldn't breathe.
she said he was going numb. - He had pain in his chest.
wait, hold on just a second.
where did the numb sensation start?
psychic said in his hands.
and that's when I knew our victim was poisoned with a neurotoxin.
the numb feeling was his muscles becoming paralyzed.
his breathing slammed to a stop, which explains the petechial bruising on his lungs.
neurotoxins don't present in tox screens.
I needed the symptoms to tell me where to look.
the numb sensation started in his hands, so that's where I looked for the injection site.
so we have a four-pronged puncture on the palm.
and our victim didn't even feel it.
why is that?
and they're deadlier than a cobra.
we can safely assume that delivery was in the killer's palm through a handshake.
Yes.
means your killer's hand will be irritated from the venom.
doctor, I know someone who has a cone snail on her menu.
get down off the ladder, Stacy.
excuse me?
Hey, these match the puncture wounds.
this is what they used to administer the poison.
let me see your palms.
palms are clean. Where's Peter?
I'm right here. Hands off your guns and get away from Stacy now.
get away from her now!
Peter, what the hell are you doing?
Peter...put the gun down, son.
come on, this isn't going to help you. - Shut up!
put your backs against that wall.
back!
all right, first thing, you guys are gonna let Stacy go.
she had nothing to do with this. - Peter, yes she did.
she hired Elena to kill her husband.
shut up! - That's not what happened, is it, Peter?
you used a dead fish to collect the venom from a cone snail.
if we waited for that old fraud to kill him, we'd never get married.
she's not a fraud, Peter. What the hell are you doing?
I promise, I'll see your psychic.
I'll let her do her thing.
she'll help us stay in tune as we negotiate what to do with the company.
I'm only doing this so that this divorce - doesn't get ugly. - I know, Brandon.
she'll be here in 30 minutes.
perfect.
thanks for doing this, Brandon.
if that dumb bitch had just left him be, you never would have figured this out.
I had nothing to do with this.
Stacy, I did this for you.
I had nothing to do with this. Peter did this on his own.
you're lying.
Peter... - I got my gun pointed at two cops.
I murdered someone to protect you so we could be together.
and you're gonna lie? - Peter did this on his own.
just tell the truth now.
what - What would you have me do now?
I didn't ask for Elena... Huh?!
don't add to this.
Peter. - What would you have me do now?!
Freeze!
Hey! Freeze!
this is Horatio Caine.
I'm going to, uh...
never mind.
so, what happens?
I mean, now that Peter's dead, what happens with Stacy?
can we charge her for anything?
Yeah, she paid to get her husband killed.
Yeah, I just think that the lawyer is gonna say that the psychic was a fake.
she believed it was real.
she was the only one who believed it was real.
you okay? - I am. I... Yes, thank you.
and thanks to you.
how about this? How about I drive you home, you give me the keys to your locker, I'll get the stuff out of there?
I'll take you up on that.
meet you out front.
what's gonna happen to her?
we're gonna both be testifying at her trial.
what about me?
state's attorney's office is gonna be filing charges against you.
but you're not gonna be alone. We're gonna be there with you every step of the way.
I'm gonna be your ace in the hole.
Mr. Wolfe, no one can ever know that she fired her weapon at us, agreed?
Yeah.
especially Natalia. - Good night.
night.
no one's gonna believe this.
this is Horatio Caine.
I have a broken water main at Fifth and Howard.
Yes, I will hold.
it's Bad, H. I got a female victim here.
she's a goner.
looks like she got shot, then hit the hydrant.
male victim, 40s. Gunshot to the head.
Walter, we've got about two minutes before this crime scene washes away.
we have to do whatever we can to protect the evidence.
I'm on it.
hurry, Walter.
are you there, sir?
Yes.
where was the emergency?
fifth and Howard.
I need the main shut off immediately.
I'm trying to preserve a crime scene.
come on, come on.
I think I see a gun!
Walter! Do you hear me?
Walter, the gun!
What?!
it's headed for the storm drain!
Walter, the murder weapon is washing away!
No!
it's gone!
what happened?
Ah, hell!
what's the matter?
the murder weapon went down the drain.
down the drain?
so, meet... Marvin Hill, 45.
gunshot wound to his left temple. Side of stippling.
so close-range shot to the head. Was there an exit wound?
um, no, I don't see one on the body.
a close-range shot to the temple is usually the most common site for a self-inflicted wound.
so you're thinking it's a murder-suicide.
maybe he shot her, shot himself.
it was a crime of passion.
Marvin was in love with who?
Rebecca West of Miami Shores.
Marvin's from Surfside.
what's the connection of our vics?
I don't know. They don't have the same last name or the same address, so...
not married.
Mr. Wolfe.
what do you got?
found a casing from a. 25 over by our male vic.
let's see if we can match it to that weapon, okay?
Yeah, I'll get it right to Calleigh.
unfortunately, most of our evidence got washed away.
I agree with that.
but we still have to figure out what happened here, so we'll have to work with what we have.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Ooh, did you bring me a present?
Yeah, this is the. 5 I rescued from the crime scene.
unfortunately, somebody scratched off the serial number.
Ryan, I hate to tell you this, but, um... you kind of smell.
I do?
I had a, uh... I had a fire hydrant raining down on me for 20 minutes.
was it a purple one?
Yes. Should I change?
definitely.
sorry.
how's it going?
one expended round, at your service.
about a quarter of an inch in diameter.
formed a protrusion right under the stratum corneum.
so it created a bulge under her skin?
right.
didn't have enough momentum to break through and exit the skin.
so, this was a low-velocity shot?
Mm - hmm, that's right.
ms. West didn't die immediately. She bled out.
do you have anything on Marvin?
uh, no apparent exit wound, so I figure the slug's still somewhere in the gray matter.
I have to dig deeper.
could take some time.
in the meantime, can I take all the clothes? Do you mind? - No.
and I will take this slug over to Calleigh and let her take a peek at it.
thank you very much.
Natalia, hey.
so, listen, the slug you brought me from Rebecca's skull was fired from the gun recovered at the scene.
it's definitely the murder weapon.
Thanks, Calleigh.
Bye.
Hey, figured you could use a hand.
I can. Thank you. Can you grab all that for me, please?
Yeah, got it.
Hey, is it me, or do Marvin's clothes reek?
no, it's not just you.
but Ryan told me that they got sprayed by a purple fire hydrant which uses non-potable water as a source.
Yeah, so it's definitely not fit for human consumption.
no wonder the guys all had to change their clothes.
I am just getting pet hair and lint from Marvin.
I got lip balm and some gum from Rebecca's pockets.
Yeah, I don't have anything here that would link our vics.
wait, wait, wait.
I'll bet those aren't very cute on Marvin,'cause they're a size two.
or our Marvin was into a little kink.
you know what, Tripp just brought his widow in.
why don't you give me those, and I'll see if his wife knows what Marvin was up to.
I'll bet you Margaritas she doesn't.
I bet you're right.
Mrs. Hill, we think your husband may have turned the gun on himself after he shot a woman.
no. No way.
Marvin hates guns.
he's been a fierce advocate against the violence they perpetuate for decades.
we both have.
lots of people have secrets.
maybe Marvin did, too.
what is that?
that's a... unmentionable.
found in your husband's pocket.
is it yours, by any chance?
absolutely not.
look, we mentioned a woman... that your husband may have shot.
I don't know anything about any woman.
this is a hard question to ask.
was Marvin having an affair?
I don't think Marvin would do that.
have you, uh, ever seen this woman?
no. I've never seen her.
is this the woman you think Marvin... was with?
we - We don't know anything for sure yet.
he told me he was just going on his morning walk.
do you think he's been lying to me every single morning?
we're going to find out, okay?
where is she?
Hey, that woman up there - that's Mrs. Hill, right?
look, I saw her on the news, okay?
they said her husband killed my mom.
excuse me.
what's the problem?
her husband killed my mom!
I just want to know why!
hey... You're Nick West, Rebecca's son, right?
right? - Yeah.
thank you, gentlemen.
come here, son. Come here.
Where's your father?
he died three years ago.
Nick, is it possible that she's seeing somebody you don't know about?
what?
you think she was hooking up with that lady's husband?
I don't know.
my mom hasn't been on a date since Dad died.
I think it's my fault.
why do you say that?
I missed my bus.
I made her drive me to school.
if she hadn't have done that... - Son, now listen to me. Look at me.
it's not your fault.
Hey, Doc, so I got your message.
you dug the bullet out of Marvin's head.
little heads... I... A warning?
I'm afraid it's way too exciting for etiquette, Walter.
this is Marvin's skull.
I see that.
see the beveling on the inside of the edge of the temporal plate?
that's what's left of the entry wound.
a small hole, but it caused these radial fractures.
then the bullet traveled through the frontal lobe, to the back of the left parietal bone and ricocheted.
wait a minute.
so you're telling me that this bullet played pinball in Marvin's brain?
that's right. Small-caliber bullets can just bounce all over the brain.
and that's what happened here?
exactly. The bullet deflected along the internal table of the occipital bone creating a gutter, only to slingshot through the brain and out here.
wait a minute. So you're also saying that the entry is also the exit?
that's right.
the only reason the bullet had enough velocity to exit was the bone had been weakened by the entrance - wound fractures.
damn. We got to get back out to that crime scene and find that bullet.
Thanks, Doc.
but I already gave the bullet to Natalia.
no, no, Tom, that was the bullet that you took out of Rebecca.
I gotta find the other bullet.
no, no, no, you don't understand.
it is my belief that the bullet that killed Rebecca killed Marvin first!
What?!
what do you got?
all right. Oh, Natalia.
perfect, the gang's all here.
all right, now, originally, we thought that Marvin shot Rebecca.
right, and then turned the gun on himself.
well, thanks to Dr. Loman, we now believe that Marvin Hill was shot first.
Really?
as impossible as it sounds, the round that entered Marvin's skull here whipped around inside, exited here, killing Rebecca.
that does sound impossible, Walter.
a little, but it got me thinking.
what if Rebecca pulled up and shot Marvin?
so then Marvin was the target.
No!
no, that's not possible, because there's no GSR in the car.
even with all the water, there would still be some left on the floor mats.
ladies and gentlemen, that leaves us with the problem of where did the round come from?
exactly.
but I think I have the answer.
I'll show it to you.
Natalia, if you would indulge me.
you be Rebecca. - Okay, I will.
careful, watch your eyes.
now... We know that if we line up the exit wound with Rebecca's position, it means that the entrance wound came from here.
bang.
so, there was a third player who took the shot.
and Rebecca... was an innocent bystander.
I thought you said Marvin shot himself.
ballistics suggest that there was a third party involved.
Marvin was the intended target of that shooting.
well, uh... then there's something you're not telling us, right?
what is it?
okay, okay.
look, Marvin was spending a lot of time on the computer.
he'd come home from work and he'd go straight to it.
I just told myself he was doing research.
you think he met someone online?
it's not like he was spending nights in seedy motels.
he was coming home.
so I didn't say anything.
I didn't want to push him further away.
would you mind if we borrowed Marvin's computer for a little while?
Yeah.
What'd you find?
check this out.
I routed it through the OS and found a hidden hard drive partition.
what was he hiding?
who's Sean?
Sean is a 19-year-old Marine.
he just got back from a tour in northern Afghanistan.
he's from Gary, Indiana, and he graduated from Hoover High School in 2008.
why would Marvin have Sean on his computer?
that's the thing.
Marvin created Sean.
I guess he just downloaded a picture off the Internet and created a social networking profile.
all right, why would Marvin want to pretend to be a 19-year-old Marine?
because he is having a relationship with "Ashley X. Hotee."
from Ashley: "Sean, I can't sleep. You're all I think about."
there's hours and hours of chats, lots of heart emoticons.
I think that Sean and Ashley were in love.
look here.
they were planning to meet.
I can't wait to see you in person in Miami
well, who's this Ashley?
Oh, my God, she's a kid.
Yeah.
so maybe Ashley gets angry that her soldier stud is really an old man with a wife.
we need to find Ashley.
are there any other pictures in Marvin's computer of Ashley?
I'm gonna do a photo-recognition search.
here we go.
Ashley at a pool party.
Ashley at Halloween.
wait a minute.
will you zoom in on that one?
Yeah.
looks like Ashley's a cheerleader at BHS, wherever that is.
look at the lower left corner of the uniform.
see that?
it's an owl.
Yeah, BHS; that's the Bayfront High School Owls.
you know what? I'm gonna call the principal and see what we can find out about this girl.
all right. Once you know something, I'll need a warrant so we can search the residence.
you have been chatting online with someone claiming to be Sean.
I don't know Sean.
and I don't chat online. I'm not allowed.
his real name is Marvin Hill, and we recovered your picture on his computer.
what's he talking about? She only uses the Internet to do her schoolwork.
Ashley, I need your help.
I sent the picture to a few friends, but that's it.
then how did this guy get it?
Marvin Hill was a 45-year-old man posing as a 19-year-old.
Yes, he was.
as in past tense. He was murdered this morning.
so we're gonna need a sample of Ashley's DNA.
DNA? Is that necessary?
absolutely not.
we found this... in Marvin's pocket.
Ashley would never wear something like that. We wouldn't let her.
you're making some pretty serious allegations about my daughter, Lieutenant.
she has never had a sexual relationship, especially not with some pathetic old man.
Mr. Chandler, sit down.
sit down.
Eric, I think it would be wise to test Mr. Chandler for gunshot residue.
so do I, H.
fine, but you're not touching Ashley.
we're gonna need you to hold out your hands, please.
you tested positive for gunshot residue.
what does that mean?
it means that your father shot a gun this morning.
do you own a gun, Mr. Chandler?
Yes, several, but I just used it earlier to shoot some armadillos off my yard.
Larry... what's going on?
just go upstairs. I'll handle this, okay?
you think I killed that predator?
you know what we think? We think that you found out Ashley was having an online fling.
you set up a date, you brought your gun, and then you realized he was a middle-aged man.
and so you shot him.
Hey, you stay away from my daughter.
Where's the gun?
I keep the guns locked in here.
step back, please.
wait a minute.
something's not right. There's the. 22 that I fired, but the. 25 is missing.
so, you saying you own a gun that matches the caliber of the murder weapon?
maybe the armadillos took it off ya.
so, Larry Chandler has an alibi.
and he said he was at the DMV all day, so I sent Homicide over there to check it out.
Yeah, he's also got a gun missing, so if we can get some evidence that he knew about Ashley and Sean's relationship, we can establish a motive for Dad.
bingo.
family computer. I don't think Ashley's got her own laptop, so she probably did her chatting here.
let me see.
okay. Parental control software.
dad could have been monitoring Ashley's chats without her knowledge.
and can you pull up all of her old chats?
Yep. Software saves everything for a week, and then it purges.
here we go.
Bayfront High study group.
florida soccer moms.
Miami golf, PTA... Ah, here we go - Teen Grapevine.
same chat room as the one on Marvin's computer.
and there's all of Ashley's chats with, uh, Marvin/Sean.
"can't wait to see you. F-T-F"?
that sounds nasty. What is that?
face-to-face. - Look at you- you're all hip to the lingo.
I'm cool. I got nephews.
Oh, wait. Who's this? Who's this Justin that just showed up all over this chat?
I don't know, but he's pretty jealous of Sean, aka Marvin.
he doesn't deserve you.
you can do better.
rot in hell and die.
wish he would R-I-H-A-D.
well, them's strong words for young Justin.
Yeah, and these are even stronger.
if wishing isn't enough, I'll make sure he does
okay, now, wait a minute. Then he just threatened to kill Sean.
so do you think he followed through on that?
I don't know, but he just logged in online.
let's let Ashley set up a meeting with him F-T-F.
"are you there" "Need to see you in real life."
are you up for it
he's thinking about it.
Oh, where do we meet him?
uh, Miami and Brickell.
Miami and Brickell.
parking garage, 3:00 p. m
see you later
Eric, it just hit 3: 00.
what do you see?
all clear so far.
you?
all quiet on the western front.
hang on a second.
got a plaid shirt in the northwest corner.
never mind. Scratch that. Forget it.
patience, brother.
wait a second. What do I have here?
southwest corner, Eric. Right there.
you see him?
I see him.
go now.
don't move! Miami-Dade Police.
keep your hands where I can see them.
don't move, kid.
stop! Stop!
stop!
what the hell are you doing, man?
I'm stepping out of my vehicle.
I didn't realize that was a crime.
it's not.
this is. - That's not mine.
I'm a little more interested in the murders of Marvin Hill and Rebecca West, Justin.
I'm not Justin.
what the hell are you doing here?
talk.
I - I... I answered an ad online.
he paid me 100 bucks to wear this shirt and walk up here.
What'd he look like?
brown hair, average height.
Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm. We don't have all day here.
okay. He was... he was driving, like, a white car.
the make.
uh, four-door. Uh, it was, like, one of those... rental car models.
what else?
um, uh, out of... out-of-state plates.
where was it from?
um, oh, I didn't... - Keep talking.
look, I don't know.
um, wait, it's, uh... - Yeah?
wait, it's... it's... New Mexico!
new Mexico. - New Mexico.
good job.
Yeah, have you, uh, recently rented out any cars with New Mexico plates on them?
okay. Thank you.
Yeah, New Mexico plates on any of the cars - you got any?
what do you mean, you don't give out that information?
excuse me?
new Mexico is not a foreign country.
What-what... what did you say?
Jiminy Christmas.
uh, yeah. Do you have any, uh... any cars with New Mexico plates?
uh, actually, we do.
I rented it out just this morning to a... Justin Carson.
young kid, late teens?
brown hair?
well, his I. D. said he was 25, but description sounds right.
Why?
he's involved in a murder.
uh... uh, that's interesting.
uh, if you could come in as soon as possible.
I'm sorry. What'd you say?
if you could come in as soon as possible.
is he there with you now?
Yes, sir. That is... that is correct.
Yeah, I'm returning my rental. Could you just put it on the card, please?
run the card.
tell him there's a problem, then put him on with me.
put me on speaker, so I can hear.
and stall as best you can.
okay.
okay, Justin. It'll be just a couple of minutes while I run this.
fine, fine. I just need to go.
how's your day going so far?
uh, fine. Just, please...
I'm afraid that there's a problem with the card, sir.
that can't be. It was working this morning.
I can get a representative on the line for you.
Yeah, just hurry up, please.
good afternoon. This is Chris from Odyssey.
I have a customer here who's having trouble with his card.
here you go.
Hello?
Hi, Mr. Carson. How are you today?
we're sorry for the inconvenience.
I apologize. We're having computer problems this morning, and it's just, uh...
you know, when those little boogers go down, they go down.
and it just happens that way.
we certainly value our customers, and we're going to get down to the bottom of this in just a second...
Where'd he go?
uh, he's sitting on a bench.
he looks really mad. Is he going to hurt me?
just stay calm. Units are almost there.
uh... okay.
Oh, no. He's coming back over.
look, just take the cash so I can get out of here.
don't let him leave. - Please!
put him on the phone with me.
uh, let's get the ball rolling, Mr. Carson.
uh, can you give me the full name as it appears on the card, please?
this is ridiculous.
you have all that information.
I need to leave.
we really do apologize for any trouble you are having.
like I said, Mr. Carson, you can be assured that we're going to take care of you.
MDPD! Stop right there! Put your hands up!
we hope you have a good day.
put 'em up! Stop right there! Do not run!
bad idea!
don't move! Don't move!
get down on the ground right now! Get down on the ground! Get down on the ground!
I am so sorry.
we have just been really backlogged since Travers took that last-minute romantic weekend.
travers has a girlfriend?
uh, well, he's not really exclusive with her or any of the others.
uh, I'm... I'm Rachel Brooks, the new girl.
nice to meet you. I'm Natalia.
Natalia Boa Vista. I know.
we studied you at the academy.
that's scary. Bad? Good?
really good!
okay. Scary.
so, you smelled something on our suspect, Justin.
Yes.
it was the same smell that was present on the victim's clothes and all over the crime scene.
did you smell him?
why, does he smell like me?
do you think we have Marvin Hill's clothes in evidence still?
but lack of personal hygiene doesn't exactly make someone a murderer.
exactly.
so we definitely need to find what that odor source was.
so how do we prove it?
diatoms, because Marvin Hill was soaked in a non-potable water source this morning.
right.
and every water source has a different mix of diatoms.
match those, you match the suspect.
so we just need to I. D. the little buggers.
let's do it.
so, we both have Rhopalodia musculus, which is fan-shaped, and...
we both have Navicula capitata.
Oval-shaped.
they definitely both came from the same water source.
which puts Justin at the crime scene during the time of the murder, right?
right.
I was only trying to protect Ashley.
protect Ashley.
you mean from Marvin Hill.
he and Ashley met up a couple of weeks ago, and he turned out to be some old dude, so Ashley freaked out and told him never to bother her again.
and how did he react to it?
well, he... he wouldn't stop harassing her.
he was threatening to show up at her house.
I mean, I was worried that he was going to try to hurt her.
so you shot Marvin.
this is for Ashley - for lying to her and stalking her!
you know, I never meant to hurt that other lady - the one in the car.
all right, Justin, enough with the excuses.
let's have some answers.
how did you know it was us online?
it was easy.
Ashley doesn't have computer lab until last period.
so I thought it was weird when she I. M.'d me.
and then at the end I wrote "S-Y-S." - "See you soon."
Yeah. That's what I always use to sign off.
and she always writes back "I-B-W."
I'll be waiting.
when she didn't, I knew something was up.
so I sent that kid to the parking garage to meet you.
you committed murder for a girl you've never even met.
no one understands me like Ashley.
she's my soul mate.
and she said that once Marvin was gone, we could meet.
you used her father's gun to commit the murder.
did your soul mate give that to you?
she left it in my hotel room after I got into Miami.
so we need the surveillance tapes, Eric.
all right, so I told you guys everything.
can I go meet Ashley, F-T-F?
son, you... you just confessed to murder.
I think I just spotted the Chandler family car on Justin's motel footage.
so you got the silver Audi.
same make and model we saw at the house.
check it out.
she goes into the room... - Yeah, 228.
Justin's room.
boom, quick, she's out.
right.
look. That was definitely a drop-off.
it was quick.
and she sure as hell is not our 17-year-old Ashley.
let me clean it up.
H, who is this woman?
it's the mother.
the mother.
I understand you got a man in custody.
so I imagine you're here to apologize.
no, actually I'm here for your wife.
what do you mean, here for her?
she's under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.
Oh, you people just don't stop, do you?
she's going to need to come with me, I'm sorry.
did you ever stop to think that maybe somebody else... - Larry?
let me go with them.
honey, are you listening to this?
I've heard it.
and I should go.
tell me they got it wrong.
I never wished this on anyone.
how could you?! You're my mother! You're supposed to protect me!
how could you do that?!
mom! Mom!
it was exciting.
that's how it started out.
the idea of this sweet, young man courting me.
I never should have brought Ashley into it.
but it snowballed.
Sean and I started sending things to each other.
like the thong?
I bought that at the mall.
Sean sent me his workout shirt.
but eventually, even that kind of thing wasn't enough.
Sean decided he wanted to meet.
Sean and I set the date together... the day after he said he was returning to the States.
I couldn't tell him who I really was on a computer screen.
we shared too much.
if it was going to end, it had to be face-to-face.
and then you met the real Sean.
you and Marvin Hill were playing the same game.
I was slightly relieved by that.
but he - he was angry at who he saw there.
I lied?
you told me you were in secret missions in the Middle East.
you're going to be sorry you ever played this game with me.
he'd call me at all hours, threatening my life.
it's telemarketers again.
don't you dare come to this house.
you should have been smart enough to call the police.
the idea of my family knowing what I was doing, that would have been worse.
that's when Justin Carson came in, said he could take care of all of it - make it all go away?
one day, there he was on my computer - another young man falling for me.
ready to do anything for me.
when he offered to help, it was a way out.
I - I asked Marvin to meet me one more time, put this all behind us.
he set the time and place.
but you sent Justin.
of course, not before you brought your husband's gun to Justin's motel room.
since your husband's such a gun enthusiast, you knew to file off the serial number.
and then Justin was on his way.
the problem is, you sent this Justin from your fantasy world, but this was a real 18-year-old kid who thought you were the love of his life, and he killed for you.
he doesn't know the truth.
but he's going to.
I thought I could just fall back into my old life.
it's not going to happen that way, Diana.
cause the rest of what life you have left, you're going to spend in jail, for the murders of Marvin Hill and Rebecca West.
what's going on?
you got a visitor.
do I know you or something?
you're Ashley?
I killed for you.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my...
what is wrong with you?!
how could you do this to me?!
why did you do this?!
you... How could you do this to me?!
you're sick!
you are sick! - No, no...
tricked Up Treat is jammed up.
and there goes Minnie Tears, getting some leverage.
Oh, here comes Minnie Tears up and around a trap...
looking for Tricked Up Treat. Quickly jamming up.
nothing going on, trying to get on the inside, trying to get up high on the rail.
she's losing it all to Minnie Tears.
tricked Up Treat got schooled.
Minnie Tears setting the standard. Oh, my God, has she got the moves.
are you ready? - Yeah, I'm ready!
let's do it. - Let's go.
and the jammer guard for the Boca Ratons, we have Miami Spice.
and for our own Miami Masochists, the crowd favorite, Wrath of Connie!
you're going down, Wrath of Connie!
good luck. - Up yours.
are you ready? And now the jammers bring it from the back of the pack.
Miami Spice and Wrath of Connie.
remember, they got to catch the pack, past the blockers to get points.
Miami Spice out in front. Keeping pace.
Connie, come on.
check out Miami Spice, getting the early lead on Wrath of Connie.
she finally broke through.
wrath of Connie looks like she's struggling a bit with her game.
what's the matter with her?
wrath of Connie's out there...
but look at Miami Spice continue to sizzle on the track.
go, go, go.
wrath of Connie trying to catch up.
you're going down, Wrath of Connie!
wrath of Connie can't keep up with Miami Spice.
she doesn't look like herself. I don't know what's wrong with her.
Miami Spice coming up, jamming on the pack from behind, looking for an opening, going high on the rail.
Oh, my God! She gets thrown into her bench!
that was a dirty move. Did you see that?
d' Beat Down getting all ugly.
what the hell is your problem?
she threw Miami Spice into her bench.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt? - Bite me, bitch!
Oh, you can't handle it?
cry me a river. Oh, here they go. They're gonna start it up.
Miami Spice, you're in the sin bin; five minutes for roughing.
sin bin! Sin bin!
five minutes for Wrath of Connie. Sit down for five, honey.
she's still yelling and screaming at the refs. They got to sit her down and shut her up.
watch the jam. Oh, look at Minnie Tears.
going with 7-Mile Midge with an elbow to the midsection.
chaos on the track, bodies flying everywhere.
Miami Spice doing five for fighting in the sin bin.
call 911! Connie?!
Oh, my God! What's happening? Connie?
bring the gurney in ASAP.
we detained as many spectators and staff as we could. Did anybody see anything?
doesn't sound like it. She left the track during a bout, and team found her in here.
Dr. Loman?
this is Wrath of Connie, aka Connie Briggs.
sizable hematoma on her upper thoracic arch.
Ah, dorsal rib compound fracture.
significant wound means a significant hit.
cause of death?
pale conjunctiva.
minimal lividity. She bled out internally, perhaps.
from just the hit like that?
takes about 150 pounds of pressure to break a rib, so yes.
I need to get her back on the table to know more.
needless to say, something very wrong happened inside Wrath of Connie here.
Yeah, these girls, they take a pretty good beating out there on the track, Tom.
maybe she got hit and rolled in here to die.
Nope, there was intent here.
size and shape of the wound - she was hit with something, an object.
so, we're talking about a weapon.
well, I mean, someone would have noticed one of these girls wielding an object out there.
so, she was murdered in here.
gentlemen...
it's called blunt... force... trauma.
skater struck down in her prime.
like that movie in the '70s starring Raquel Welch?
no, roller derby's real, man. Wait till you see it.
Wolfe, you never been to the roller derby before?
I haven't been on roller skates since junior high.
you're missing out, man! That was 50 pounds ago!
these women - these women are badass.
they're badass? Hell, they're girls on roller skates. How badass can they be?
so, how long you gonna make us wait here with these skanks, huh?
yo, who the hell are you calling a skank?
I wasn't talking to you, Spice. - I don't care if you're talking to me...
Oh, my God, that's the sexiest, scariest thing I've ever seen.
I told you!
what the heck?! It's starting, huh?
we got to get the refs in here! Oh, here they all come in on it!
starting up. They can't stand each other.
masochist and a Loca Boca. There's haymakers breaking out.
there's beer cups being tossed in the crowd.
this is what they pay to see.
Haymakers! Oh, God, just... a left and a right...
heat can't even control 'em! The heat can't even stop 'em. Oh!
there's bodies flying. The crowd's whipping beers.
Hey, hey, that's it, stop it!
all right? Geez, Louise!
there's haymakers breaking out, chaos... - You! Come here! Come here.
Miami Spice? I got to talk to you; come on. - Yes.
Hey, somebody get Dave Benton down here, set up a mobile AV unit.
and shut that guy the hell up!
chaos in here! Whoa, 5-0 wants a piece of me.
shut it down, huh? You got it, po-po, chill.
witnesses saw you get in a fight with Connie before she left the track.
fighting's just a stress reliever.
better to have it out on the track than the alley afterwards.
besides, Deb was the one who took the cheap shot.
Deb? Who's Deb? Oh, that's D' Beat Down? Beat Down is Deb?
where do you guys come up with these names?
Derby names? - Yeah.
we make 'em up. Like your favorite wrestler, except we don't fake it.
well, I don't think that you were faking your anger towards Connie, were you?
my blood was boiling, yeah, but yours would be, too.
angry enough to follow her in the bathroom, start a fight?
you really think I killed her because of a dustup on the track?
look, I was right where I was supposed to be - in the sin bin.
you were in the what?
it's like a penalty box in hockey.
I got five minutes for roughing.
well, I'll be looking into that.
I bet you will.
that's not professional.
not bad.
looks like the victim and D' Beat Down were pretty close.
you know, we got a helmet over here.
think it got knocked off during the attack?
maybe.
you, uh, you find anything that resembles a murder weapon?
no, not yet, but you know, these girls wear a lot of gear.
all the girls were out on the track when the murder happened.
Yeah, it's true.
toilet full of vomit here.
mouth guard.
Yeah, she probably spit this out when she threw up.
or it got knocked out.
Oh, you know, I don't think so.
I think she was using the stall to hold herself up.
she was violently ill.
that's why she came off the track, I bet.
wonder what made her so sick. - I don't know.
I'm gonna have Tom run a tox on what's left in her stomach, and he can tell us.
Hey, Benton? - Yeah.
got that game footage cued up? - Yup, ready for playback.
...going high on the rail.
but look at D' Beat Down with a throw down into her teammate...
girls are hardcore. - I've been trying to tell y'all.
coach caught the brawl on video.
was anyone targeting the victim?
there's Olivia Adler. She was in the sin bin.
...headed to the sin bin.
and that's the last time that we see Connie.
she's headed to the locker room to throw up.
okay.
well, that confirms Olivia's alibi.
what is a sin bin?
uh, don't ask.
Oh! Oh, that's got to hurt.
Oh, D' Beat Down got beat down.
she flew off the track.
wait a second.
Where's Debbie? Where'd she go?
she never came back on.
this is five minutes ahead.
uh, now ten.
it looks like the Masochists are gonna pull away and get it done.
try 15.
...and the crowd is...
Oh, there she is. She's back now.
but we have no idea exactly when she came back.
where is she? Where is Deb?
that's a 15-minute window she's not on the rink.
that's enough time to kill Connie Briggs.
I know it's fun to watch, but landing in the crowd like that hurts. A lot.
it took a lot of work to walk it off.
Why?
because you went missing around the time that Connie was murdered.
I didn't kill Connie.
we're just collecting as much information as possible so that we can catch the person who did.
I wouldn't hurt Connie. She was my derby wife.
Derby huh?
partner in crime, on and off the track.
she had my back, and I had hers.
I was supposed to have hers.
so you guys were a couple?
not like you mean it. We weren't sleeping together.
but Connie and I - we had a bond.
she was a riot girl, like me. We just got each other.
hmm. She gave you any of those bruises?
no. What is your problem? I didn't do this.
look, derby is a full-contact sport. It hurts.
fights, punches, scratches. It's all part of the competition, and the competition is the show.
Deb, we are just checking your bruises to see if they could have come from a struggle with Connie.
I have nothing to hide.
except for the 15 minutes that you went missing.
look, I landed in the crowd. It took a while to get out.
I had to handle some fan relations.
is that another euphemism?
I posed for a couple of pictures, signed some autographs. That's it.
while your derby wife was beat to death.
Dr. Loman?
I was right. She bled out internally.
chest cavity is completely filled. - I can see that.
you're looking at a massive vessel rupture, probably caused by the broken rib, but I won't know what ruptured what until I clean out the cavity.
what do you make of the bruising?
contusions from cranium to phalanges.
apparently, injuries like this are a way of life for derby girls.
or... a way of death.
poor choice of words.
in any event, tox screen on her stomach contents shows she ingested ipecac.
ipecac used to induce vomiting, which explains why she was sick.
it's going to be difficult to conclude how it was administered.
ipecac syrup has a sweet flavor.
could have sneaked it into a sports drink without her knowing.
but why ipecac her at all? - Maybe to get her alone. What else?
this. Irritation of her upper gums.
see the bruising here, here and here?
Mm. From her mouth guard, maybe?
there's one amongst her effects.
maybe an ill-fitting one?
it fits, but barely.
maybe it's not hers.
or maybe she mixed it up with one of her teammates.
or maybe it got swapped out.
Connie, let's go. The jam's on.
this is one of those, uh, do-it-yourself mouth pieces.
the ones you boil to soften, and then you mold it to your own teeth.
whoever swapped them would have had to use their own mouth to do it.
right.
so we have our killer's dental impressions, but there's no database to compare them to.
Yeah, see, DNA's still the best way to go, but the only problem is, it's only the victim's DNA profile I've been able to find.
testing AGAINST CONTROL SAMPLES DNA SEQUENCING COMPLETE
Oh. Here's another DNA profile.
more of the same, or another skater's?
definitely not.
this is male.
all right, look, I know how this looks, and what you guys might be thinking, but I did not hurt Connie.
explain, then, why you swapped out her mouth guard with one laced with ipecac.
uh, I didn't.
you molded it yourself, idiot.
which means we can match it to you.
okay, not my finest hour, I will admit that.
it's also gonna bring you an assault charge.
look, Connie was a monster on the track.
okay, the only chance my team had of winning is if she wasn't playing.
all right? Besides, ipecac is harmless.
unlike the beating you gave her.
no, I didn't. I just... I wanted to get her a little sick so she couldn't play.
you got money riding on this? - No, I just want to see my team win.
well, I'm the biggest sports fan you'll ever meet, but that is just plain stupid.
Yeah, well, it's the truth. - So you say now.
Hi. Um, I'm Lucy Strickland.
Lucy, you're Connie's emergency contact?
Yeah, I'm her roommate. I got your message.
is it true?
I'm afraid that it is. I am so sorry.
Lucy, I do have a few things I'd like to ask you, if you feel like you might be up to it.
Yeah, okay.
Lucy, how did you know Connie?
we've been friends since we met freshman year.
when we graduated, we made the big move to Miami.
can you think of anyone who would want to hurt her?
no. No, Connie's a sweetheart.
she likes to put on that tough act, but that's all it is. It's an act.
she treats everyone the way she wants to be treated.
what about this gentleman? Does he look familiar to you?
no. Is he the one who did it?
I'm sorry; I can't give you any information like that. - Yeah, I understand.
let's talk about the derby. It seems to me like it was a very rough place.
did Connie ever say anything about that?
no, we didn't really talk about the derby all that much. That was kinda her thing.
I do remember she said something about a player named Tara 'N Feathered.
I guess they got into a thing when she first started out in one of her competitions.
that was, like, four months ago.
you said "Tara 'N Feathered"?
Yeah. She always used the girls' derby names. I don't even know her real name.
Lucy, thank you. - Yeah.
so, I just finished interviewing the rest of the team. And they all love Connie.
she's their star jammer, although she was quite a scrapper.
what about an opponent?
well, her roommate mentioned a girl named Tara 'N Feathered- real name Tara Werner
and I guess, uh, they got in a pretty big fight about four months ago.
where was she during the murder?
well, she was in physical therapy, so she says.
I think she might work there. - Okay, maybe she took a break.
excuse me, ma'am - Tara Werner?
thank you.
excuse me.
Tara Werner? CSI Boa Vista.
I talked to you on the phone earlier today.
no, that's Celia. I'm Tara Werner.
you're Tara 'N Feathered?
guilty. - And you're a patient here?
severed my T-9 and T-10 vertebrae.
as a result of your scuffle with Connie Briggs, right?
Oh, I'm good. Thanks, Celia.
no, Connie and I got into a jam. Neither one of us wanted to give in.
I clipped a wheel, hit the rail... haven't been outside of this lovely place since.
why didn't you mention this on the phone?
well, I don't lead with "I'm a paraplegic."
and I don't blame Connie.
there's no sorry in roller derby.
that's just part of the game.
we've been hearing that a lot lately, haven't we? - Excuse me!
Tara, I'm sorry I'm late.
Mr. Kessler, what are you doing here?
she's my sister, and she has nothing to do with this.
your sister?
Werner's my married name. What are they talking about, Vince?
don't worry about it.
she's in a wheelchair, man. She couldn't have hurt anybody.
you know what? You guys have to go.
Mr. Kessler... - I know my rights.
you know what? Why don't you and I take a walk, then we'll discuss your rights outside.
ms. Werner, is there a place that we can talk?
Yeah, we can, we can go out here.
ow, that hurts.
Hey, take it easy.
you lied to us. - About what?
you lied to us about your sister.
I didn't mention Tara because I didn't think it was important.
Really? So the girl who got beaten to death today just happened to paralyze your sister. I'd say that's motive enough.
that happened a long time ago. Tara's dealing with it.
you know what I think you did?
I think you used the ipecac to get Connie into the locker room so that you could kill her for - what she did to your sister. - No, no, no, no.
look, it was just a dumb prank, okay?
I know what I did was stupid, but Connie ruined my sister's life.
all right, Tara had been skating for years, and that rookie came and destroyed everything.
my sister's career was over just like that.
Connie had to pay.
with her life?
that wasn't my doing, but if you ask me, karma's a bitch.
can I go?
Yeah.
sorry about my brother.
Yeah.
do you think it's possible - he had something to do with Connie's death? - No.
this has been tough on him, but he wouldn't hurt anybody.
sometimes people will do drastic things for family.
what if I told you that he was with me all morning?
I'd say that you were being less than honest with me.
look, my brother knows I wasn't mad at Connie.
I never blamed her, not for one minute.
I'm fine here.
you know, sure, I miss skating, but as long as I'm making progress, I'm happy.
you know, it's possible that your experience as a skater might be helpful.
Connie was struck with something from the rink or the locker room, and I was wondering if you recognize that pattern.
Yeah, I've seen that.
where have you seen it before?
on me, after a bout.
used to have bruises that shape all the time.
it's from an elbow pad.
an elbow pad, and you're sure about that?
Yeah, there's lots of different kinds of pads, but some of the girls wear some with the harder edges.
leaves a mark like that.
that help? - It does... very much.
okay, ladies, this is called an evidence bag.
what I need you to do is take your elbow pads, put 'em in the bag, zip it up, hand it to this handsome fella right here.
Walter.
thank you.
Hey. - Hey.
sorry about earlier.
that's all right.
you got a nice cross.
I know.
chop-chop, ladies, let's go.
we have to find the elbow pad that will make the same impression as what killed Connie.
can you ink me up, please? - Yeah.
thank you.
ready?
okay. 100 psi.
okay.
here's the impression on Connie's back.
now, I didn't hit it with enough force to break a rib, but, hmm, not a bad match, though, so let me hang on to that one.
my turn? - Yeah.
will you try to hit him a little bit higher?
I think I hit him too low.
uh, 69.
well, let's look at the shape.
no, it's not the right shape either. - Okay.
well, we'll keep trying.
okay, let's hang on to that.
121 psi. - Okay.
it's a pretty good match shapewise.
bring the heat this time.
that was better. That was better.
sounds like women's tennis in here.
we're trying to replicate the bruise on the vic's back. - Okay.
actually, we've gotten pretty close with two of 'em. We've got the right shape with these two, but we just can't get the right force.
hmm, mind if I give it a try?
what are you trying to say?
I'm just saying force equals mass times acceleration.
and I've got a little more arm mass than either one of you.
clearly. - Ah, elbow pad.
Oh, yeah.
I fear you've met your match, Rick.
need some ink?
all right.
now, Loman says it takes 150 pounds of pressure to break a rib, right?
right. - All right.
nice!
167 psi. Nice shot.
you broke a rib. Let's see.
it's a perfect match.
an elbow pad is definitely the murder weapon.
guess it's safe to say that our killer is a male.
I don't know; did you see some of those girls?
it could be a really strong female.
definitely stronger than either one of you two.
Oh, I've got to go. I just got a 911 text from Tom.
all right.
Hey, got your text.
I found the source of the internal bleeding.
her thoracic aorta was penetrated. Shredded, actually.
now, do you think that that was from the hit, or do you think that was from the broken rib?
from this.
a piece of bone?
it was dislodged by the attack, then pierced the aorta, causing a catastrophic tear.
but here's the strange thing.
I pieced together the fractured rib.
this shard didn't fit in the puzzle.
okay...
Look...this bone has an older fracture that predates today's break.
Oh, well, then that could have come from another derby injury.
except the remodeled bone has formed a hard callus over the older fracture.
that amount of healing is at least six months old.
that's before she was ever in the derby.
there's more.
I looked over the X-rays my assistants took when they brought her in.
she has other, older fractures.
zygomatic bone, at least six months old. - Oh, yeah...
radius fracture around the same time.
and look here.
she's got an old healed burn.
at least eight months old.
okay, so these are all very intimate injuries.
are you thinking domestic abuse?
that's what it looks like. Which means...
which means the abuse contributed to her death.
the shard was just hanging on before being completely dislodged by the attack in the locker room.
we've got to find her abuser, 'cause more than likely that's her killer.
I'll do anything I can to help.
I shared an apartment with her, but her medical history-how would I know that?
well, her autopsy had revealed that she had sustained some severe injuries prior to ever being in the derby.
you think she was seeing anyone?
uh, yeah, she was seeing this one guy, but they broke up like four months ago.
do you remember his name?
um, he was one of those biker-dude types.
I didn't really know him.
do you think he was ever physical with her?
physical?
Yes, we think the relationship may have been abusive.
he's gonna know that I told you, Lieutenant.
he's gonna come; he's gonna hurt me, too.
Lucy, you had to have seen something.
she had a broken wrist, she had a broken cheek bone.
would I have to go to court?
no, you wouldn't.
okay, um...I used to hear them argue out on the phone, by her car.
I thought it was just typical stuff, though.
she would call him a stick of dynamite and say she didn't know what to do with him.
did she ever explain the injuries?
no, no, she wouldn't even discuss it.
it's funny, 'cause she doesn't seem the type - to put up with that kind of abuse. - Yeah.
well, I think that's kinda why she joined the derby in the first place.
she liked the way it made her feel-you know, empowered and in control.
Yeah, it's probably the only place that made her feel that way.
sounds like she was trying to take a stand against the guy, though.
do you know where we can find Jake?
well, he would always take her on rides out in Miami Shores.
thank you.
Hey!
Hey, buddy, pull over!
pull over!
damn it! Pull over! Pull over!
damn it.
come on, shut the bike off!
let's go, Jake McGrath, hands on your head, now!
put your hands up, now.
get off!
what? I guess I couldn't hear you, man; I'm sorry.
take those off; it's illegal to use those, dumbass.
and so's running from the cops.
we tell you to stop, you stop.
I stopped.
why the hell the hassle?
Connie Briggs is dead, Jake.
Wh... How?
why don't you tell me?
I know I told you you could look around, but take it easy.
like you did with Connie, Jake?
you think you know something about me?
you do like to hit women, Jake.
you put her in the hospital on more than one occasion.
you have no idea.
she was defenseless, and you kept coming at her.
you know what you are, Jake? - What?
you're a coward. - Great.
I'm a coward. If that's what you're trying to prove, you're not going to find anything here.
what the hell was that?
I'm not surprised you have one of these.
what do we got?
see that.
indentations that match the ones from the murder weapon.
elbow pads. - Exactly right.
did you practice on this before you killed her, Jake?
wrong. I got that thing for Connie.
she used it more than I did.
kinda got me going when she got all Angelina Jolie on it.
what, are you saying you never used it at all, huh?
no, I used it, but those marks-Connie made those.
she and a friend would take turns practicing blocking or something.
I was just hoping they'd get worked up and take turns on me.
her friend - you mean Deb Taylor?
no, her roommate, Lucy.
they were both hell-bent on being roller derby queens.
is that Lucy Strickland?
let's bring her in. This time, with a warrant.
Yeah.
you got nothing on me.
I'll make bail in a couple hours.
that's all I'm gonna need, Jake.
so, you didn't mention that you were a derby girl.
uh, I'm not.
that's odd, 'cause we found this in your trunk.
Yeah, I... I tried out; I just didn't make any of the squads.
but you still had access to the locker room, right?
y - You guys think that I killed Connie?
see, this is exactly why I didn't want to say anything about Jake.
Why? - Because he's a master manipulator.
I mean, he screwed up Connie so bad she kept going back to him, and now he has you guys thinking that I killed her?
what is it? It's an elbow pad.
it's heavier than any of the other ones we tested.
Yeah, I use a heavier grade for more protection.
much heavier grade. This isn't plastic.
no, this is steel.
you replaced the plastic with this to make it more lethal, didn't you?
when you were trying out for the team?
we were looking for brute force, but steel would definitely do the trick.
nothing. Try this one.
here we go. It's positive for blood.
that's probably from a practice bout. - Maybe, yeah.
but why don't we just cut to the chase, then, and see if this doesn't have Connie's DNA on it?
okay, look, I just...I just...
I needed an advantage in the game, okay?
I wasn't trying to kill anyone.
Yeah, but you were jealous of Connie because she made it onto a team and you washed out.
no, I was... I was happy for Connie.
she loved the derby. She loved it more than anything.
loved it more than you.
it was my idea to join the derby.
I wanted us to do it together, but all of a sudden she couldn't give me five minutes of her time.
you all right?
what are you doing here?
why are you wearing a uniform?
you could say hello, you know?
I'm sick.
I just wanted to try it on.
I wasn't going to take it.
they told me to clean out my gear.
I don't know, I guess they needed the locker space.
I'm sorry, Luce.
Yeah, it's fine. You know, there's always next season.
just need a couple of killer moves.
you can help me with that, right?
I don't know.
maybe you're just not cut out for derby.
what?
it's like Deb's always saying.
you got to be fierce. You know?
you're just not fierce.
we were best friends, and...
